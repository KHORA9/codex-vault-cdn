Besides\r\ntheir ordinary condition all bodies are capable of being thrown into a\r\nphysical state in which they are said to be electrified or charged with\r\nelectricity. When in this condition they become sources of electric\r\nforce, and the space round them in which this force is manifested is\r\ncalled an \"electric field\" (see ELECTRICITY). Electrified bodies exert\r\nmechanical forces on each other, creating or tending to create motion,\r\nand also induce electric charges on neighbouring surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe reader possessed of no previous knowledge of electrical phenomena\r\nwill best appreciate the meaning of the terms employed by the aid of a\r\nfew simple experiments. For this purpose the following apparatus should\r\nbe provided:--(1) two small metal tea-trays and some clean dry tumblers,\r\nthe latter preferably varnished with shellac varnish made with alcohol\r\nfree from water; (2) two sheets of ebonite rather larger than the\r\ntea-trays; (3) a rod of sealing-wax or ebonite and a glass tube, also\r\nsome pieces of silk and flannel; (4) a few small gilt pith balls\r\nsuspended by dry silk threads; (5) a gold-leaf electroscope, and, if\r\npossible, a simple form of quadrant electrometer (see ELECTROSCOPE and\r\nELECTROMETER); (6) some brass balls mounted on the ends of ebonite\r\npenholders, and a few tin canisters. With the aid of this apparatus, the\r\nprincipal facts of electrostatics can be experimentally verified, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n_Experiment I._--Place one tea-tray bottom side uppermost upon three\r\nwarm tumblers as legs. Rub the sheet of ebonite vigorously with warm\r\nflannel and lay it rubbed side downwards on the top of the tray. Touch\r\nthe tray with the finger for an instant, and lift up the ebonite without\r\nletting the hand touch the tray a second time. The tray is then found to\r\nbe electrified. If a suspended gilt pith ball is held near it, the ball\r\nwill first be attracted and then repelled. If small fragments of paper\r\nare scattered on the tray and then the other tray held in the hand over\r\nthem, they will fly up and down rapidly. If the knuckle is approached to\r\nthe electrified tray, a small spark will be seen, and afterwards the\r\ntray will be found to be discharged or unelectrified. If the electrified\r\ntray is touched with the sealing-wax or ebonite rod, it will not be\r\ndischarged, but if touched with a metal wire, the hand, or a damp\r\nthread, it is discharged at once. This shows that some bodies are\r\n_conductors_ and others _non-conductors_ or _insulators_ of electricity,\r\nand that bodies can be electrified by friction and impart their electric\r\ncharge to other bodies. A charged conductor supported on a non-conductor\r\nretains its charge. It is then said to be insulated.\r\n\r\n_Experiment II._--Arrange two tea-trays, each on dry tumblers as before.\r\nRub the sheet of ebonite with flannel, lay it face downwards on one\r\ntray, touch that tray with the finger for a moment and lift up the\r\nebonite sheet, rub it again, and lay it face downwards on the second\r\ntray and leave it there. Then take two suspended gilt pith balls and\r\ntouch them (a) both against one tray; they will be found to repel each\r\nother; (b) touch one against one tray and the other against the other\r\ntray, and they will be found to attract each other. This proves the\r\nexistence of two kinds of electricity, called _positive_ and _negative_.\r\nThe first tea-tray is positively electrified, and the second\r\nnegatively. If an insulated brass ball is touched against the first tray\r\nand then against the knob or plate of the electroscope, the gold leaves\r\nwill diverge. If the ball is discharged and touched against the other\r\ntray, and then afterwards against the previously charged electroscope,\r\nthe leaves will collapse. This shows that the two electricities\r\nneutralize each other's effect when imparted equally to the same\r\nconductor.\r\n\r\n_Experiment III._--Let one tray be insulated as before, and the\r\nelectrified sheet of ebonite held over it, but not allowed to touch the\r\ntray. If the ebonite is withdrawn without touching the tray, the latter\r\nwill be found to be unelectrified. If whilst holding the ebonite sheet\r\nover the tray the latter is also touched with an insulated brass ball,\r\nthen this ball when removed and tested with the electroscope will be\r\nfound to be negatively electrified. The sign of the electrification\r\nimparted to the electroscope when so charged--that is, whether positive\r\nor negative--can be determined by rubbing the sealing-wax rod with\r\nflannel and the glass rod with silk, and approaching them gently to the\r\nelectroscope one at a time. The sealing-wax so treated is electrified\r\nnegatively or _resinously_, and the glass with positive or _vitreous_\r\nelectricity. Hence if the electrified sealing-wax rod makes the leaves\r\ncollapse, the electroscopic charge is positive, but if the glass rod\r\ndoes the same, the electroscopic charge is negative. Again, if, whilst\r\nholding the electrified ebonite over the tray, we touch the latter for a\r\nmoment and then withdraw the ebonite sheet, the tray will be found to be\r\npositively electrified. The electrified ebonite is said to act by\r\n\"electrostatic induction\" on the tray, and creates on it two induced\r\ncharges, one of positive and the other of negative electricity. The last\r\ngoes to earth when the tray is touched, and the first remains when the\r\ntray is insulated and the ebonite withdrawn.\r\n\r\n_Experiment IV._--Place a tin canister on a warm tumbler and connect it\r\nby a wire with the gold-leaf electroscope. Charge positively a brass\r\nball held on an ebonite stem, and introduce it, without touching, into\r\nthe canister. The leaves of the electroscope will diverge with positive\r\nelectricity. Withdraw the ball and the leaves will collapse. Replace the\r\nball again and touch the outside of the canister; the leaves will\r\ncollapse. If then the ball be withdrawn, the leaves will diverge a\r\nsecond time with negative electrification. If, before withdrawing the\r\nball, after touching the outside of the canister for a moment the ball\r\nis touched against the inside of the canister, then on withdrawing it\r\nthe ball and canister are found to be discharged. This experiment proves\r\nthat when a charged body acts by induction on an insulated conductor it\r\ncauses an electrical separation to take place; electricity of opposite\r\nsign is drawn to the side nearest the inducing body, and that of like\r\nsign is repelled to the remote side, and these quantities are equal in\r\namount.\r\n\r\n_Seat of the Electric Charge._--So far we have spoken of electric charge\r\nas if it resided on the conductors which are electrified. The work of\r\nBenjamin Franklin, Henry Cavendish, Michael Faraday and J. Clerk Maxwell\r\ndemonstrated, however, that all electric charge or electrification of\r\nconductors consists simply in the establishment of a physical state in\r\nthe surrounding insulator or dielectric, which state is variously called\r\n_electric strain_, _electric displacement_ or _electric polarization_.\r\nUnder the action of the same or identical electric forces the intensity\r\nof this state in various insulators is determined by a quality of them\r\ncalled their _dielectric constant_, _specific inductive capacity_ or\r\n_inductivity_. In the next place we must notice that electrification is\r\na measurable magnitude and in electrostatics is estimated in terms of a\r\nunit called the _electrostatic unit_ of electric quantity. In the\r\nabsolute C.G.S. system this unit quantity is defined as follows:--If we\r\nconsider a very small electrified spherical conductor, experiment shows\r\nthat it exerts a repulsive force upon another similar and similarly\r\nelectrified body. Cavendish and C.A. Coulomb proved that this mechanical\r\nforce varies inversely as the square of the distance between the centres\r\nof the spheres. The unit of mechanical force in the \"centimetre, gramme,\r\nsecond\" (C.G.S.) system of units is the _dyne_, which is approximately\r\nequal to 1/981 part of the weight of one gramme. A very small sphere is\r\nsaid then to possess a charge of one electrostatic unit of quantity,\r\nwhen it repels another similar and similarly electrified body with a\r\nforce of one dyne, the centres being at a distance of one centimetre,\r\nprovided that the spheres are _in vacuo_ or immersed in some insulator,\r\nthe dielectric constant of which is taken as unity. If the two small\r\nconducting spheres are placed with centres at a distance d centimetres,\r\nand immersed in an insulator of dielectric constant K, and carry charges\r\nof Q and Q' electrostatic units respectively, measured as above\r\ndescribed, then the mechanical force between them is equal to QQ'/Kd^2\r\ndynes. For constant charges and distances the mechanical force is\r\ninversely as the dielectric constant.\r\n\r\n_Electric Force._--If a small conducting body is charged with Q\r\nelectrostatic units of electricity, and placed in any electric field at\r\na point where the electric force has a value E, it will be subject to a\r\nmechanical force equal to QE dynes, tending to move it in the direction\r\nof the resultant electric force. This provides us with a definition of a\r\nunit of electric force, for it is the strength of an electric field at\r\nthat point where a small conductor carrying a unit charge is acted upon\r\nby unit mechanical force, assuming the dielectric constant of the\r\nsurrounding medium to be unity. To avoid unnecessary complications we\r\nshall assume this latter condition in all the following discussion,\r\nwhich is equivalent simply to assuming that all our electrical\r\nmeasurements are made in air or _in vacuo_.\r\n\r\nOwing to the confusion introduced by the employment of the term force,\r\nMaxwell and other writers sometimes use the words _electromotive\r\nintensity_ instead of electric force. The reader should, however, notice\r\nthat what is generally called electric force is the analogue in\r\nelectricity of the so-called acceleration of gravity in mechanics,\r\nwhilst electrification or quantity of electricity is analogous to mass.\r\nIf a mass of M grammes be placed in the earth's field at a place where\r\nthe acceleration of gravity has a value g centimetres per second, then\r\nthe mechanical force acting on it and pulling it downwards is Mg dynes.\r\nIn the same manner, if an electrified body carries a positive charge Q\r\nelectrostatic units and is placed in an electric field at a place where\r\nthe electric force or electromotive intensity has a value E units, it is\r\nurged in the direction of the electric force with a mechanical force\r\nequal to QE dynes. We must, however, assume that the charge Q is so\r\nsmall that it does not sensibly disturb the original electric field, and\r\nthat the dielectric constant of the insulator is unity.\r\n\r\nFaraday introduced the important and useful conception of _lines_ and\r\n_tubes_ of electric force. If we consider a very small conductor charged\r\nwith a unit of positive electricity to be placed in an electric field,\r\nit will move or tend to move under the action of the electric force in a\r\ncertain direction. The path described by it when removed from the action\r\nof gravity and all other physical forces is called a line of electric\r\nforce. We may otherwise define it by saying that a line of electric\r\nforce is a line so drawn in a field of electric force that its direction\r\ncoincides at every point with the resultant electric force at that\r\npoint. Let _any_ line drawn in an electric field be divided up into\r\nsmall elements of length. We can take the sum of all the products of the\r\nlength of each element by the resolved part of the electric force in its\r\ndirection. This sum, or integral, is called the \"line integral of\r\nelectric force\" or the _electromotive force_ (E.M.F.) along this line.\r\nIn some cases the value of this electromotive force between two points\r\nor conductors is independent of the precise path selected, and it is\r\nthen called the _potential difference_ (P.D.) of the two points or\r\nconductors. We may define the term potential difference otherwise by\r\nsaying that it is the work done in carrying a small conductor charged\r\nwith one unit of electricity from one point to the other in a direction\r\nopposite to that in which it would move under the electric forces if\r\nleft to itself.\r\n\r\n_Electric Potential._--Suppose then that we have a conductor charged\r\nwith electricity; we may imagine its surface to be divided up into small\r\nunequal areas, each of which carries a unit charge of electricity. If we\r\nconsider lines of electric force to be drawn from the boundaries of\r\nthese areas, they will cut up the space round the conductor into tubular\r\nsurfaces called tubes of electric force, and each tube will spring from\r\nan area of the conductor carrying a unit electric charge. Hence the\r\ncharge on the conductor can be measured by the number of unit electric\r\ntubes springing from it. In the next place we may consider the charged\r\nbody to be surrounded by a number of closed surfaces, such that the\r\npotential difference between any point on one surface and the earth is\r\nthe same. These surfaces are called \"equipotential\" or \"level surfaces,\"\r\nand we may so locate them that the potential difference between two\r\nadjacent surfaces is one unit of potential; that is, it requires one\r\nabsolute unit of work (1 erg) to move a small body charged with one unit\r\nof electricity from one surface to the next. These enclosing surfaces,\r\ntherefore, cut up the space into shells of potential, and divide up the\r\ntubes of force into electric cells. The surface of a charged conductor\r\nis an equipotential surface, because when the electric charge is in\r\nequilibrium there is no tendency for electricity to move from one part\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\nWe arbitrarily call the potential of the earth zero, since all potential\r\ndifference is relative and there is no absolute potential any more than\r\nabsolute level. We call the difference of potential between a charged\r\nconductor and the earth the potential of the conductor. Hence when a\r\nbody is charged positively its potential is raised above that of the\r\nearth, and when negatively it is lowered beneath that of the earth.\r\nPotential in a certain sense is to electricity as difference of level is\r\nto liquids or difference of temperature to heat. It must be noted,\r\nhowever, that potential is a mere mathematical concept, and has no\r\nobjective existence like difference of level, nor is it capable per se\r\nof producing physical changes in bodies, such as those which are brought\r\nabout by rise of temperature, apart from any question of difference of\r\ntemperature. There is, however, this similarity between them.\r\nElectricity tends to flow from places of high to places of low\r\npotential, water to flow down hill, and heat to move from places of high\r\nto places of low temperature. Returning to the case of the charged body\r\nwith the space around it cut up into electric cells by the tubes of\r\nforce and shells of potential, it is obvious that the number of these\r\ncells is represented by the product QV, where Q is the charge and V the\r\npotential of the body in electrostatic units. An electrified conductor\r\nis a store of energy, and from the definition of potential it is clear\r\nthat the work done in increasing the charge q of a conductor whose\r\npotential is v by a small amount dq, is vdq, and since this added charge\r\nincreases in turn the potential, it is easy to prove that the work done\r\nin charging a conductor with Q units to a potential V units is 1/2 QV\r\nunits of work. Accordingly the number of electric cells into which the\r\nspace round is cut up is equal to twice the energy stored up, or each\r\ncell contains half a unit of energy. This harmonizes with the fact that\r\nthe real seat of the energy of electrification is the dielectric or\r\ninsulator surrounding the charged conductor.[1]\r\n\r\nWe have next to notice three important facts in electrostatics and some\r\nconsequences flowing therefrom.\r\n\r\n(i) _Electrical Equilibrium and Potential._--If there be any number of\r\ncharged conductors in a field, the electrification on them being in\r\nequilibrium or at rest, the surface of each conductor is an\r\nequipotential surface. For since electricity tends to move between\r\npoints or conductors at different potentials, if the electricity is at\r\nrest on them the potential must be everywhere the same. It follows from\r\nthis that the electric force at the surface of the conductor has no\r\ncomponent along the surface, in other words, the electric force at the\r\nbounding surface of the conductor and insulator is everywhere at right\r\nangles to it.\r\n\r\nBy the _surface density_ of electrification on a conductor is meant the\r\ncharge per unit of area, or the number of tubes of electric force which\r\nspring from unit area of its surface. Coulomb proved experimentally that\r\nthe electric force just outside a conductor at any point is proportional\r\nto the electric density at that point. It can be shown that the\r\nresultant electric force normal to the surface at a point just outside a\r\nconductor is equal to 4[pi][sigma], where [sigma] is the surface\r\ndensity at that point. This is usually called Coulomb's Law.[2]\r\n\r\n(ii) _Seat of Charge._--The charge on an electrified conductor is wholly\r\non the surface, and there is no electric force in the interior of a\r\nclosed electrified conducting surface which does not contain any other\r\nelectrified bodies. Faraday proved this experimentally (see\r\n_Experimental Researches_, series xi. S 1173) by constructing a large\r\nchamber or box of paper covered with tinfoil or thin metal. This was\r\ninsulated and highly electrified. In the interior no trace of electric\r\ncharge could be found when tested by electroscopes or other means.\r\nCavendish proved it by enclosing a metal sphere in two hemispheres of\r\nthin metal held on insulating supports. If the sphere is charged and\r\nthen the jacketing hemispheres fitted on it and removed, the sphere is\r\nfound to be perfectly discharged.[3] Numerous other demonstrations of\r\nthis fact were given by Faraday. The thinnest possible spherical shell\r\nof metal, such as a sphere of insulator coated with gold-leaf, behaves\r\nas a conductor for static charge just as if it were a sphere of solid\r\nmetal. The fact that there is no electric force in the interior of such\r\na closed electrified shell is one of the most certainly ascertained\r\nfacts in the science of electrostatics, and it enables us to demonstrate\r\nat once that particles of electricity attract and repel each other with\r\na force which is inversely as the square of their distance.\r\n\r\nWe may give in the first place an elementary proof of the converse\r\nproposition by the aid of a simple lemma:--\r\n\r\n_Lemma._--If particles of matter attract one another according to the\r\nlaw of the inverse square the attraction of all sections of a cone for a\r\nparticle at the vertex is the same. _Definition._--The solid angle\r\nsubtended by any surface at a point is measured by the quotient of its\r\napparent surface by the square of its distance from that point. Hence\r\nthe total solid angle round any point is 4[pi]. The solid angles\r\nsubtended by all normal sections of a cone at the vertex are therefore\r\nequal, and since the attractions of these sections on a particle at the\r\nvertex are proportional to their distances from the vertex, they are\r\nnumerically equal to one another and to the solid angle of the cone.\r\n\r\nLet us then suppose a spherical shell O to be electrified. Select any\r\npoint P in the interior and let a line drawn through it sweep out a\r\nsmall double cone (see fig. 1). Each cone cuts out an area on the\r\nsurface equally inclined to the cone axis. The electric density on the\r\nsphere being uniform, the quantities of electricity on these areas are\r\nproportional to the areas, and if the electric force varies inversely as\r\nthe square of the distance, the forces exerted by these two surface\r\ncharges at the point in question are proportional to the solid angle of\r\nthe little cone. Hence the forces due to the two areas at opposite ends\r\nof the chord are equal and opposed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nHence we see that if the whole surface of the sphere is divided into\r\npairs of elements by cones described through any interior point, the\r\nresultant force at that point must consist of the sum of pairs of equal\r\nand opposite forces, and is therefore zero. For the proof of the\r\nconverse proposition we must refer the reader to the _Electrical\r\nResearches of the Hon. Henry Cavendish_, p. 419, or to Maxwell's\r\n_Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism_, 2nd ed., vol. i. p. 76, where\r\nMaxwell gives an elegant proof that if the force in the interior of a\r\nclosed conductor is zero, the law of the force must be that of the\r\ninverse square of the distance.[4] From this fact it follows that we can\r\nshield any conductor entirely from external influence by other charged\r\nconductors by enclosing it in a metal case. It is not even necessary\r\nthat this envelope should be of solid metal; a cage made of fine metal\r\nwire gauze which permits objects in its interior to be seen will yet be\r\na perfect electrical screen for them. Electroscopes and electrometers,\r\ntherefore, standing in proximity to electrified bodies can be perfectly\r\nshielded from influence by enclosing them in cylinders of metal gauze.\r\n\r\nEven if a charged and insulated conductor, such as an open canister or\r\ndeep cup, is not perfectly closed, it will be found that a proof-plane\r\nconsisting of a small disk of gilt paper carried at the end of a rod of\r\ngum-lac will not bring away any charge if applied to the deep inside\r\nportions. In fact it is curious to note how large an opening may be made\r\nin a vessel which yet remains for all electrical purposes \"a closed\r\nconductor.\" Maxwell (_Elementary Treatise_, &c., p. 15) ingeniously\r\napplied this fact to the insulation of conductors. If we desire to\r\ninsulate a metal ball to make it hold a charge of electricity, it is\r\nusual to do so by attaching it to a handle or stem of glass or ebonite.\r\nIn this case the electric charge exists at the point where the stem is\r\nattached, and there leakage by creeping takes place. If, however, we\r\nemploy a hollow sphere and let the stem pass through a hole in the side\r\nlarger than itself, and attach the end to the interior of the sphere,\r\nthen leakage cannot take place.\r\n\r\nAnother corollary of the fact that there is no electric force in the\r\ninterior of a charged conductor is that the potential in the interior is\r\nconstant and equal to that at the surface. For by the definition of\r\npotential it follows that the electric force in any direction at any\r\npoint is measured by the space rate of change of potential in that\r\ndirection or E = [+-]dV/dx. Hence if the force is zero the potential V must\r\nbe constant.\r\n\r\n(iii.) _Association of Positive and Negative Electricities._--The third\r\nleading fact in electrostatics is that positive and negative electricity\r\nare always created in equal quantities, and that for every charge, say,\r\nof positive electricity on one conductor there must exist on some other\r\nbodies an equal total charge of negative electricity. Faraday expressed\r\nthis fact by saying that no absolute electric charge could be given to\r\nmatter. If we consider the charge of a conductor to be measured by the\r\nnumber of tubes of electric force which proceed from it, then, since\r\neach tube must end on some other conductor, the above statement is\r\nequivalent to saying that the charges at each end of a tube of electric\r\nforce are equal.\r\n\r\nThe facts may, however, best be understood and demonstrated by\r\nconsidering an experiment due to Faraday, commonly called the ice pail\r\nexperiment, because he employed for it a pewter ice pail (_Exp. Res._\r\nvol. ii. p. 279, or _Phil. Mag._ 1843, 22). On the plate of a gold-leaf\r\nelectroscope place a metal canister having a loose lid. Let a metal ball\r\nbe suspended by a silk thread, and the canister lid so fixed to the\r\nthread that when the lid is in place the ball hangs in the centre of the\r\ncanister. Let the ball and lid be removed by the silk, and let a charge,\r\nsay, of positive electricity (+Q) be given to the ball. Let the canister\r\nbe touched with the finger to discharge it perfectly. Then let the ball\r\nbe lowered into the canister. It will be found that as it does so the\r\ngold-leaves of the electroscope diverge, but collapse again if the ball\r\nis withdrawn. If the ball is lowered until the lid is in place, the\r\nleaves take a steady deflection. Next let the canister be touched with\r\nthe finger, the leaves collapse, but diverge again when the ball is\r\nwithdrawn. A test will show that in this last case the canister is left\r\nnegatively electrified. If before the ball is withdrawn, after touching\r\nthe outside of the canister with the finger, the ball is tilted over to\r\nmake it touch the inside of the canister, then on withdrawing it the\r\ncanister and ball are found to be perfectly discharged. The explanation\r\nis as follows: the charge (+Q) of positive electricity on the ball\r\ncreates by induction an equal charge (-Q) on the inside of the canister\r\nwhen placed in it, and repels to the exterior surface of the canister an\r\nequal charge (+Q). On touching the canister this last charge goes to\r\nearth. Hence when the ball is touched against the inside of the canister\r\nbefore withdrawing it a second time, the fact that the system is found\r\nsubsequently to be completely discharged proves that the charge -Q\r\ninduced on the inside of the canister must be exactly equal to the\r\ncharge +Q on the ball, and also that the inducing action of the charge\r\n+Q on the ball created equal quantities of electricity of opposite sign,\r\none drawn to the inside and the other repelled to the outside of the\r\ncanister.\r\n\r\n_Electrical Capacity._--We must next consider the quality of a conductor\r\ncalled its electrical capacity. The potential of a conductor has already\r\nbeen defined as the mechanical work which must be done to bring up a\r\nvery small body charged with a unit of positive electricity from the\r\nearth's surface or other boundary taken as the place of zero potential\r\nto the surface of this conductor in question. The mathematical\r\nexpression for this potential can in some cases be calculated or\r\npredetermined.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Potential of a sphere.\r\n\r\n  Thus, consider a sphere uniformly charged with Q units of positive\r\n  electricity. It is a fundamental theorem in attractions that a thin\r\n  spherical shell of matter which attracts according to the law of the\r\n  inverse square acts on all external points as if it were concentrated\r\n  at its centre. Hence a sphere having a charge Q repels a unit charge\r\n  placed at a distance x from its centre with a force Q/x^2 dynes, and\r\n  therefore the work W in ergs expended in bringing the unit up to that\r\n  point from an infinite distance is given by the integral\r\n         _\r\n        /x\r\n    W = |  Qx^-2 dx = Q/x    (1).\r\n       _/[oo]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Capacity of a sphere.\r\n\r\n  Hence the potential at the surface of the sphere, and therefore the\r\n  potential of the sphere, is Q/R, where R is the radius of the sphere\r\n  in centimetres. The quantity of electricity which must be given to the\r\n  sphere to raise it to unit potential is therefore R electrostatic\r\n  units. The capacity of a conductor is defined to be the charge\r\n  required to raise its potential to unity, all other charged conductors\r\n  being at an infinite distance. This capacity is then a function of the\r\n  geometrical dimensions of the conductor, and can be mathematically\r\n  determined in certain cases. Since the potential of a small charge of\r\n  electricity dQ at a distance r is equal to dQ/r, and since the\r\n  potential of all parts of a conductor is the same in those cases in\r\n  which the distribution of surface density of electrification is\r\n  uniform or symmetrical with respect to some point or axis in the\r\n  conductor, we can calculate the potential by simply summing up terms\r\n  like [sigma]dS/r, where dS is an element of surface, [sigma] the\r\n  surface density of electricity on it, and r the distance from the\r\n  symmetrical centre. The capacity is then obtained as the quotient of\r\n  the whole charge by this potential. Thus the distribution of\r\n  electricity on a sphere in free space must be uniform, and all parts\r\n  of the charge are at an equal distance R from the centre. Accordingly\r\n  the potential _at_ the centre is Q/R. But this must be the potential\r\n  _of_ the sphere, since all parts are at the same potential V. Since\r\n  the capacity C is the ratio of charge to potential, the capacity of\r\n  the sphere in free space is Q/V = R, or is numerically the same as its\r\n  radius reckoned in centimetres.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Capacity of a thin rod.\r\n\r\n  We can thus easily calculate the capacity of a long thin wire like a\r\n  telegraph wire far removed from the earth, as follows: Let 2r be the\r\n  diameter of the wire, l its length, and [sigma] the uniform surface\r\n  electric density. Then consider a thin annulus of the wire of width\r\n  dx; the charge on it is equal to 2[pi]r[sigma]/dx units, and the\r\n  potential V at a point on the axis at a distance x from the annulus\r\n  due to this elementary charge is\r\n\r\n           _l/2\r\n          /     2[pi]r[sigma]\r\n    V = 2 |   -----------------dx = 4[pi]r[sigma] {log_e (1/2 l + [root][r^2 + 1/4 l^2]) - log_e ^r}.\r\n         _/   [root](r^2 + x^2)\r\n           0\r\n\r\n  If, then, r is small compared with l, we have V = 4[pi]r[sigma]log_e\r\n  l/r. But the charge is Q = 2[pi]r[sigma], and therefore the capacity\r\n  of the thin wire is given by\r\n\r\n    C = 1/2 log_e l/r   (2).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Potential of an ellipsoid.\r\n\r\n  A more difficult case is presented by the ellipsoid[5]. We have first\r\n  to determine the mode in which electricity distributes itself on a\r\n  conducting ellipsoid in free space. It must be such a distribution\r\n  that the potential in the interior will be constant, since the\r\n  electric force must be zero. It is a well-known theorem in attractions\r\n  that if a shell is made of gravitative matter whose inner and outer\r\n  surfaces are similar ellipsoids, it exercises no attraction on a\r\n  particle of matter in its interior[6]. Consider then an ellipsoidal\r\n  shell the axes of whose bounding surfaces are (a, b, c) and (a + da),\r\n  (b + db), (c + dc), where da/a = db/b = dc/c = [mu]. The potential of\r\n  such a shell at any internal point is constant, and the equipotential\r\n  surfaces for external space are ellipsoids confocal with the\r\n  ellipsoidal shell. Hence if we distribute electricity over an\r\n  ellipsoid, so that its density is everywhere proportional to the\r\n  thickness of a shell formed by describing round the ellipsoid a\r\n  similar and slightly larger one, that distribution will be in\r\n  equilibrium and will produce a constant potential throughout the\r\n  interior. Thus if [sigma] is the surface density, [delta] the\r\n  thickness of the shell at any point, and [rho] the assumed volume\r\n  density of the matter of the shell, we have [sigma] = A[delta][rho].\r\n  Then the quantity of electricity on any element of surface dS is A\r\n  times the mass of the corresponding element of the shell; and if Q is\r\n  the whole quantity of electricity on the ellipsoid, Q = A times the\r\n  whole mass of the shell. This mass is equal to 4[pi]abc[rho][mu];\r\n  therefore Q = A4[pi]abc[rho][mu] and [delta] = [mu]p, where p is the\r\n  length of the perpendicular let fall from the centre of the ellipsoid\r\n  on the tangent plane. Hence\r\n\r\n    [sigma] = Qp/4[pi]abc   (3).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Capacity of an ellipsoid.\r\n\r\n  Accordingly for a given ellipsoid the surface density of free\r\n  distribution of electricity on it is everywhere proportional to the\r\n  length of the perpendicular let fall from the centre on the tangent\r\n  plane at that point. From this we can determine the capacity of the\r\n  ellipsoid as follows: Let p be the length of the perpendicular from\r\n  the centre of the ellipsoid, whose equation is x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 +\r\n  z^2/c^2 = 1 to the tangent plane at x, y, z. Then it can be shown that\r\n  1/p^2 = x^2/a^4 + y^2/b^4 + z^2/c^4 (see Frost's _Solid Geometry_, p.\r\n  172). Hence the density [sigma] is given by\r\n\r\n                 Q                       1\r\n    [sigma] = --------  -----------------------------------,\r\n              4[pi]abc  [root](x^2/a^4 + y^2/b^4 + z^2/c^4)\r\n\r\n  and the potential at the centre of the ellipsoid, and therefore its\r\n  potential as a whole is given by the expression,\r\n         _                        _\r\n        / [sigma]dS       Q      /                 dS\r\n    V = | --------- =  --------  | ------------------------------------   (4).\r\n       _/     r        4[pi]abc _/ r[root](x^2/a^4 + y^2/b^4 + z^2/c^4)\r\n\r\n  Accordingly the capacity C of the ellipsoid is given by the equation\r\n                    _\r\n    1        1     /                           dS\r\n    -- = --------  | ----------------------------------------------------------  (5).\r\n    C    4[pi]abc _/ [root](x^2 + y^2 + z^2)[root](x^2/a^4 + y^2/b^4 + z^2/c^4)\r\n\r\n  It has been shown by Professor Chrystal that the above integral may\r\n  also be presented in the form,[7]\r\n              _\r\n    1        /[oo]                      d[lambda]\r\n    -- = 1/2 |    --------------------------------------------------------  (6).\r\n    C       _/0   [root]{(a^2 + [lambda])(b^2 + [lambda])(c^2 + [lambda])}\r\n\r\n  The above expressions for the capacity of an ellipsoid of three\r\n  unequal axes are in general elliptic integrals, but they can be\r\n  evaluated for the reduced cases when the ellipsoid is one of\r\n  revolution, and hence in the limit either takes the form of a long rod\r\n  or of a circular disk.\r\n\r\n  Thus if the ellipsoid is one of revolution, and ds is an element of\r\n  arc which sweeps out the element of surface dS, we have\r\n\r\n                                /dx\\                /py\\    2[pi]b^2\r\n    dS = 2[pi]yds = 2[pi]ydx / ( -- ) = 2[pi]ydx / ( -- ) = -------- dx.\r\n                                \\ds/                \\ b/        p\r\n\r\n  Hence, since [sigma] = Qp/4[pi]ab^2, [sigma]dS = Qdx/2a.\r\n\r\n  Accordingly the distribution of electricity is such that equal\r\n  parallel slices of the ellipsoid of revolution taken normal to the\r\n  axis of revolution carry equal charges on their curved surface.\r\n\r\n  The capacity C of the ellipsoid of revolution is therefore given by\r\n  the expression\r\n              _\r\n    1    1   /        dx\r\n    -- = --  | -----------------   (7).\r\n    C    2a _/ [root](x^2 + y^2)\r\n\r\n  If the ellipsoid is one of revolution round the major axis a (prolate)\r\n  and of eccentricity e, then the above formula reduces to\r\n\r\n    1     1                /1 + e\\\r\n    -- = --- log_[epsilon]( ----- )  (8).\r\n    C1   2ae               \\1 - e/\r\n\r\n  Whereas if it is an ellipsoid of revolution round the minor axis b\r\n  (oblate), we have\r\n\r\n     1     sin^-1 ae\r\n    --- = ----------   (9).\r\n    C^2       ae\r\n\r\n  In each case we have C = a when e = 0, and the ellipsoid thus becomes\r\n  a sphere.\r\n\r\n  In the extreme case when e = 1, the prolate ellipsoid becomes a long\r\n  thin rod, and then the capacity is given by\r\n\r\n    C1 = a/log_[epsilon] 2a/b   (10),\r\n\r\n  which is identical with the formula (2) already obtained. In the other\r\n  extreme case the oblate spheroid becomes a circular disk when e = 1,\r\n  and then the capacity C2 = 2a/[pi]. This last result shows that the\r\n  capacity of a thin disk is 2/[pi] = 1/1.571 of that of a sphere of the\r\n  same radius. Cavendish (_Elec. Res._ pp. 137 and 347) determined in\r\n  1773 experimentally that the capacity of a sphere was 1.541 times that\r\n  of a disk of the same radius, a truly remarkable result for that date.\r\n\r\n  Three other cases of practical interest present themselves, viz. the\r\n  capacity of two concentric spheres, of two coaxial cylinders and of\r\n  two parallel planes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Capacity of two concentric spheres.\r\n\r\n  Consider the case of two concentric spheres, a solid one enclosed in a\r\n  hollow one. Let R1 be the radius of the inner sphere, R2 the inside\r\n  radius of the outer sphere, and R2 the outside radius of the outer\r\n  spherical shell. Let a charge +Q be given to the inner sphere. Then\r\n  this produces a charge -Q on the inside of the enclosing spherical\r\n  shell, and a charge +Q on the outside of the shell. Hence the\r\n  potential V at the centre of the inner sphere is given by V =\r\n  Q/R1 - Q/R2 + Q/R3. If the outer shell is connected to the earth, the\r\n  charge +Q on it disappears, and we have the capacity C of the inner\r\n  sphere given by\r\n\r\n    C = 1/R1 - 1/R2 = (R2 - R1)/R1R2   (11).\r\n\r\n  Such a pair of concentric spheres constitute a condenser (see LEYDEN\r\n  JAR), and it is obvious that by making R2 nearly equal to R1, we may\r\n  enormously increase the capacity of the inner sphere. Hence the name\r\n  _condenser_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Capacity of two coaxial cylinders.\r\n\r\n  The other case of importance is that of two coaxial cylinders. Let a\r\n  solid circular sectioned cylinder of radius R1 be enclosed in a\r\n  coaxial tube of inner radius R2. Then when the inner cylinder is at\r\n  potential V1 and the outer one kept at potential V2 the lines of\r\n  electric force between the cylinders are radial. Hence the electric\r\n  force E in the interspace varies inversely as the distance from the\r\n  axis. Accordingly the potential V at any point in the interspace is\r\n  given by\r\n                                _\r\n                               /\r\n    E = -dV/dR = A/R or V = -A | R^-1 dR,  (12),\r\n                              _/\r\n\r\n  where R is the distance of the point in the interspace from the axis,\r\n  and A is a constant. Hence V2 - V1 = -A log R2/R1. If we consider a\r\n  length l of the cylinder, the charge Q on the inner cylinder is Q =\r\n  2[pi]R1l[sigma], where [sigma] is the surface density, and by\r\n  Coulomb's law [sigma] = E1/4 [pi], where E1 = A/R1 is the force at the\r\n  surface of the inner cylinder.\r\n\r\n  Accordingly Q = 2[pi]R1lA/4[pi]R1 = Al/2. If then the outer cylinder\r\n  be at zero potential the potential V of the inner one is\r\n\r\n    V = A log (R2/R1), and its capacity C = l/2 log R2/R1.\r\n\r\n  This formula is important in connexion with the capacity of electric\r\n  cables, which consist of a cylindrical conductor (a wire) enclosed in\r\n  a conducting sheath. If the dielectric or separating insulator has a\r\n  constant K, then the capacity becomes K times as great.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Capacity of two parallel planes.\r\n\r\n    \"Edge effect.\"\r\n\r\n  The capacity of two parallel planes can be calculated at once if we\r\n  neglect the distribution of the lines of force near the edges of the\r\n  plates, and assume that the only field is the uniform field between\r\n  the plates. Let V1 and V2 be the potentials of the plates, and let a\r\n  charge Q be given to one of them. If S is the surface of each plate,\r\n  and d their distance, then the electric force E in the space between\r\n  them is E = (V1-V2)/d. But if [sigma] is the surface density, E =\r\n  4[pi][sigma], and [sigma] = Q/S. Hence we have\r\n\r\n    (V1 - V2) d = 4[pi]Q/S or C = Q/(V1 - V2) = S/4[pi]d  (13).\r\n\r\n  In this calculation we neglect altogether the fact that electric force\r\n  distributed on curved lines exists outside the interspace between the\r\n  plates, and these lines in fact extend from the back of one plate to\r\n  that of the other. G.R. Kirchhoff (_Gesammelte Abhandl._ p. 112) has\r\n  given a full expression for the capacity C of two circular plates of\r\n  thickness t and radius r placed at any distance d apart in air from\r\n  which the edge effect can be calculated. Kirchhoff's expression is as\r\n  follows:--\r\n\r\n        [pi]r^2      r    /                16[pi]r(d+t)                   d + t\\\r\n    C = ------- + ------ ( d log_[epsilon] ------------ + t log_[epsilon] ----- ) (14).\r\n        4[pi]d    4[pi]d  \\                [epsilon]d^2                     t  /\r\n\r\n  In the above formula [epsilon] is the base of the Napierian\r\n  logarithms. The first term on the right-hand side of the equation is\r\n  the expression for the capacity, neglecting the curved edge\r\n  distribution of electric force, and the other terms take into account,\r\n  not only the uniform field between the plates, but also the\r\n  non-uniform field round the edges and beyond the plates.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Guard plates.\r\n\r\n  In practice we can avoid the difficulty due to irregular distribution\r\n  of electric force at the edges of the plate by the use of a guard\r\n  plate as first suggested by Lord Kelvin.[8] If a large plate has a\r\n  circular hole cut in it, and this is nearly filled up by a circular\r\n  plate lying in the same plane, and if we place another large plate\r\n  parallel to the first, then the electric field between this second\r\n  plate and the small circular plate is nearly uniform; and if S is the\r\n  area of the small plate and d its distance from the opposed plate, its\r\n  capacity may be calculated by the simple formula C = S/4[pi]d. The\r\n  outer larger plate in which the hole is cut is called the \"guard\r\n  plate,\" and must be kept at the same potential as the smaller inner or\r\n  \"trap-door plate.\" The same arrangement can be supplied to a pair of\r\n  coaxial cylinders. By placing metal plates on either side of a larger\r\n  sheet of dielectric or insulator we can construct a condenser of\r\n  relatively large capacity. The instrument known as a Leyden jar (q.v.)\r\n  consists of a glass bottle coated within and without for three parts\r\n  of the way up with tinfoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Systems of condensers.\r\n\r\n  If we have a number of such condensers we can combine them in\r\n  \"parallel\" or in \"series.\" If all the plates on one side are connected\r\n  together and also those on the other, the condensers are joined in\r\n  parallel. If C1, C2, C3, &c., are the separate capacities, then\r\n  [Sigma](C) = C1 + C2 + C3 + &c., is the total capacity in parallel. If\r\n  the condensers are so joined that the inner coating of one is\r\n  connected to the outer coating of the next, they are said to be in\r\n  series. Since then they are all charged with the same quantity of\r\n  electricity, and the total over all potential difference V is the sum\r\n  of each of the individual potential differences V1, V2, V3, &c., we\r\n  have\r\n\r\n    Q = C1V1 = C2V2 = C3V3 = &c., and V = V1 + V2 + V3 + &c.\r\n\r\n  The resultant capacity is C = Q/V, and\r\n\r\n    C = 1/(1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3 + &c.) = 1/[Sigma](1/C)  (15).\r\n\r\n  These rules provide means for calculating the resultant capacity when\r\n  any number of condensers are joined up in any way.\r\n\r\n  If one condenser is charged, and then joined in parallel with another\r\n  uncharged condenser, the charge is divided between them in the ratio\r\n  of their capacities. For if C1 and C2 are the capacities and Q1 and Q2\r\n  are the charges after contact, then Q1/C1 and Q2/C2 are the potential\r\n  differences of the coatings and must be equal. Hence Q1/C1 = Q2/C2 or\r\n  Q1/Q2 = C1/C2. It is worth noting that if we have a charged sphere we\r\n  can perfectly discharge it by introducing it into the interior of\r\n  another hollow insulated conductor and making contact. The small\r\n  sphere then becomes part of the interior of the other and loses all\r\n  charge.\r\n\r\n  _Measurement of Capacity._--Numerous methods have been devised for the\r\n  measurement of the electrical capacity of conductors in those cases in\r\n  which it cannot be determined by calculation. Such a measurement may\r\n  be an _absolute_ determination or a _relative_ one. The dimensions of\r\n  a capacity in electrostatic measure is a length (see UNITS, PHYSICAL).\r\n  Thus the capacity of a sphere in electrostatic units (E.S.U.) is the\r\n  same as the number denoting its radius in centimetres. The unit of\r\n  electrostatic capacity is therefore that of a sphere of 1 cm.\r\n  radius.[9] This unit is too small for practical purposes, and hence a\r\n  unit of capacity 900,000 greater, called a microfarad, is generally\r\n  employed. Thus for instance the capacity in free space of a sphere 2\r\n  metres in diameter would be 100/900,000 = 1/9000 of a microfarad. The\r\n  electrical capacity of the whole earth considered as a sphere is about\r\n  800 microfarads. An absolute measurement of capacity means, therefore,\r\n  a determination in E.S. units made directly without reference to any\r\n  other condenser. On the other hand there are numerous methods by which\r\n  the capacities of condensers may be compared and a relative\r\n  measurement made in terms of some standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Relative determinations.\r\n\r\n  One well-known comparison method is that of C.V. de Sauty. The two\r\n  condensers to be compared are connected in the branches of a\r\n  Wheatstone's Bridge (q.v.) and the other two arms completed with\r\n  variable resistance boxes. These arms are then altered until on\r\n  raising or depressing the battery key there is no sudden deflection\r\n  either way of the galvanometer. If R1 and R2 are the arms' resistances\r\n  and C1 and C2 the condenser capacities, then when the bridge is\r\n  balanced we have R1 : R2 = C1 : C2.\r\n\r\n  Another comparison method much used in submarine cable work is the\r\n  method of mixtures, originally due to Lord Kelvin and usually called\r\n  Thomson and Gott's method. It depends on the principle that if two\r\n  condensers of capacity C1 and C2 are respectively charged to\r\n  potentials V1 and V2, and then joined in parallel with terminals of\r\n  opposite charge together, the resulting potential difference of the\r\n  two condensers will be V, such that\r\n\r\n        (C1V1 - C2V2)\r\n    V = -------------  (16);\r\n           (C + C)\r\n\r\n  and hence if V is zero we have C1 : C2 = V2 : V1.\r\n\r\n  The method is carried out by charging the two condensers to be\r\n  compared at the two sections of a high resistance joining the ends of\r\n  a battery which is divided into two parts by a movable contact.[10]\r\n  This contact is shifted until such a point is found by trial that the\r\n  two condensers charged at the different sections and then joined as\r\n  above described and tested on a galvanometer show no charge. Various\r\n  special keys have been invented for performing the electrical\r\n  operations expeditiously.\r\n\r\n  A simple method for condenser comparison is to charge the two\r\n  condensers to the same voltage by a battery and then discharge them\r\n  successively through a ballistic galvanometer (q.v.) and observe the\r\n  respective \"throws\" or deflections of the coil or needle. These are\r\n  proportional to the capacities. For the various precautions necessary\r\n  in conducting the above tests special treatises on electrical testing\r\n  must be consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Absolute determinations.\r\n\r\n  In the absolute determination of capacity we have to measure the ratio\r\n  of the charge of a condenser to its plate potential difference. One of\r\n  the best methods for doing this is to charge the condenser by the\r\n  known voltage of a battery, and then discharge it through a\r\n  galvanometer and repeat this process rapidly and successively. If a\r\n  condenser of capacity C is charged to potential V, and discharged n\r\n  times per second through a galvanometer, this series of intermittent\r\n  discharges is equivalent to a current nCV. Hence if the galvanometer\r\n  is calibrated by a potentiometer (q.v.) we can determine the value of\r\n  this current in amperes, and knowing the value of n and V thus\r\n  determine C. Various forms of commutator have been devised for\r\n  effecting this charge and discharge rapidly by J.J. Thomson, R.T.\r\n  Glazebrook, J.A. Fleming and W.C. Clinton and others.[11] One form\r\n  consists of a tuning-fork electrically maintained in vibration of\r\n  known period, which closes an electric contact at every vibration and\r\n  sets another electromagnet in operation, which reverses a switch and\r\n  moves over one terminal of the condenser from a battery to a\r\n  galvanometer contact. In another form, a revolving contact is used\r\n  driven by an electric motor, which consists of an insulating disk\r\n  having on its surface slips of metal and three wire brushes a, b, c\r\n  (see fig. 2) pressing against them. The metal slips are so placed\r\n  that, as the disk revolves, the middle brush, connected to one\r\n  terminal of the condenser C, is alternately put in conductive\r\n  connexion with first one and then the other outside brush, which are\r\n  joined respectively to the battery B and galvanometer G terminals.\r\n  From the speed of this motor the number of commutations per second can\r\n  be determined. The above method is especially useful for the\r\n  determinations of very small capacities of the order of 100\r\n  electrostatic units or so and upwards.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n_Dielectric constant._--Since all electric charge consists in a state of\r\nstrain or polarization of the dielectric, it is evident that the\r\nphysical state and chemical composition of the insulator must be of\r\ngreat importance in determining electrical phenomena. Cavendish and\r\nsubsequently Faraday discovered this fact, and the latter gave the name\r\n\"specific inductive capacity,\" or \"dielectric constant,\" to that quality\r\nof an insulator which determines the charge taken by a conductor\r\nembedded in it when charged to a given potential. The simplest method of\r\ndetermining it numerically is, therefore, that adopted by Faraday.[12]\r\nHe constructed two equal condensers, each consisting of a metal ball\r\nenclosed in a hollow metal sphere, and he provided also certain\r\nhemispherical shells of shellac, sulphur, glass, resin, &c., which he\r\ncould so place in one condenser between the ball and enclosing sphere\r\nthat it formed a condenser with solid dielectric. He then determined the\r\nratio of the capacities of the two condensers, one with air and the\r\nother with the solid dielectric. This gave the dielectric constant K of\r\nthe material. Taking the dielectric constant of air as unity he obtained\r\nthe following values, for shellac K = 2.0, glass K = 1.76, and sulphur K\r\n= 2.24.\r\n\r\n  TABLE I.--_Dielectric Constants (K) of Solids (K for Air = 1)._\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------+-------+--------------------+\r\n  |            Substance.            |   K.  |     Authority.     |\r\n  +----------------------------------+-------+--------------------+\r\n  | Glass, double extra dense flint, |       |                    |\r\n  |   density 4.5                    | 9.896 | J.

There are very\r\nconsiderable differences between the values assigned by different\r\nobservers, sometimes no doubt due to differences in method, but in most\r\ncases unquestionably depending on variations in the quality of the\r\nspecimens examined.

This variation, however, is not always linear. In some\r\ncases there is a very sudden drop at or below a certain temperature to a\r\nmuch lower value, and above and below the point the temperature\r\nvariation is small. There is also a large difference in most cases\r\nbetween the value for a steadily applied electric force and a rapidly\r\nreversed or intermittent force--in the last case a decrease with\r\nincrease of frequency. Maxwell (_Elec. and Magn._ vol. ii. S 788) showed\r\nthat the square root of the dielectric constant should be the same\r\nnumber as the refractive index for waves of the same frequency (see\r\nELECTRIC WAVES). There are very few substances, however, for which the\r\noptical refractive index has the same value as K for steady or slowly\r\nvarying electric force, on account of the great variation of the value\r\nof K with frequency.\r\n\r\nThere is a close analogy between the variation of dielectric constant of\r\nan insulator with electric force frequency and that of the rigidity or\r\nstiffness of an elastic body with the frequency of applied mechanical\r\nstress. Thus pitch is a soft and yielding body under steady stress, but\r\na bar of pitch if struck gives a musical note, which shows that it\r\nvibrates and is therefore stiff or elastic for high frequency stress.\r\n\r\n_Residual Charges in Dielectrics._--In close connexion with this lies\r\nthe phenomenon of residual charge in dielectrics.[14] If a glass Leyden\r\njar is charged and then discharged and allowed to stand awhile, a second\r\ndischarge can be obtained from it, and in like manner a third, and so\r\non. The reappearance of the residual charge is promoted by tapping the\r\nglass. It has been shown that this behaviour of dielectrics can be\r\nimitated by a mechanical model consisting of a series of perforated\r\npistons placed in a tube of oil with spiral springs between each\r\npiston.[15] If the pistons are depressed and then released, and then the\r\nupper piston fixed awhile, a second discharge can be obtained from it,\r\nand the mechanical stress-strain diagram of the model is closely similar\r\nto the discharge curve of a dielectric. R.H.A. Kohlrausch called\r\nattention to the close analogy between residual charge and the elastic\r\nrecovery of strained bodies such as twisted wire or glass threads. If a\r\ncharged condenser is suddenly discharged and then insulated, the\r\nreappearance of a potential difference between its coatings is analogous\r\nto the reappearance of a torque in the case of a glass fibre which has\r\nbeen twisted, released suddenly, and then gripped again at the ends.\r\n\r\n  For further information on the qualities of dielectrics the reader is\r\n  referred to the following sources:--J. Hopkinson, \"On the Residual\r\n  Charge of the Leyden Jar,\" _Phil. Trans._, 1876, 166 [ii.], p. 489,\r\n  where it is shown that tapping the glass of a Leyden jar permits the\r\n  reappearance of the residual charge; \"On the Residual Charge of the\r\n  Leyden Jar,\" ib. 167 [ii.], p. 599, containing many valuable\r\n  observations on the residual charge of Leyden jars; W.E.

Sitz.-Ber._, 1874, 70.\r\n\r\n  _Distribution of Electricity on Conductors._--We now proceed to\r\n  consider in more detail the laws which govern the distribution of\r\n  electricity at rest upon conductors. It has been shown above that the\r\n  potential due to a charge of q units placed on a very small sphere,\r\n  commonly called a point-charge, at any distance x is q/x. The\r\n  mathematical importance of this function called the potential is that\r\n  it is a scalar quantity, and the potential at any point due to any\r\n  number of point charges q1, q2, q3, &c., distributed in any manner, is\r\n  the sum of them separately, or\r\n\r\n    q1/x1 + q2/x2 + q3/x3 + &c. = [Sigma](q/x) = V  (17),\r\n\r\n  where x1, x2, x3, &c., are the distances of the respective point\r\n  charges from the point in question at which the total potential is\r\n  required. The resultant electric force E at that point is then\r\n  obtained by differentiating V, since E = -dV/dx, and E is in the\r\n  direction in which V diminishes fastest. In any case, therefore, in\r\n  which we can sum up the elementary potentials at any point we can\r\n  calculate the resultant electric force at the same point.\r\n\r\n  We may describe, through all the points in an electric field which\r\n  have the same potential, surfaces called equipotential surfaces, and\r\n  these will be everywhere perpendicular or orthogonal to the lines of\r\n  electric force. Let us assume the field divided up into tubes of\r\n  electric force as already explained, and these cut normally by\r\n  equipotential surfaces. We can then establish some important\r\n  properties of these tubes and surfaces. At each point in the field the\r\n  electric force can have but one resultant value. Hence the\r\n  equipotential surfaces cannot cut each other. Let us suppose any other\r\n  surface described in the electric field so as to cut the closely\r\n  compacted tubes. At each point on this surface the resultant force has\r\n  a certain value, and a certain direction inclined at an angle [theta]\r\n  to the normal to the selected surface at that point. Let dS be an\r\n  element of the surface. Then the quantity E cos [theta]dS is the\r\n  product of the normal component of the force and an element of the\r\n  surface, and if this is summed up all over the surface we have the\r\n  total electric flux or induction through the surface, or the surface\r\n  integral of the normal force mathematically expressed by [int]E cos\r\n  [theta]dS, provided that the dielectric constant of the medium is\r\n  unity.\r\n\r\n  We have then a very important theorem as follows:--If any closed\r\n  surface be described in an electric field which wholly encloses or\r\n  wholly excludes electrified bodies, then the total flux through this\r\n  surface is equal to 4[pi]- times the total quantity of electricity\r\n  within it.[16] This is commonly called Stokes's theorem. The proof is\r\n  as follows:--Consider any point-charge E of electricity included in\r\n  any surface S, S, S (see fig. 3), and describe through it as centre a\r\n  cone of small solid angle d[omega] cutting out of the enclosing\r\n  surface in two small areas dS and dS' at distances x and x'. Then the\r\n  electric force due to the point charge q at distance x is q/x, and the\r\n  resolved part normal to the element of surface dS is q cos[theta]/x^2.\r\n  The normal section of the cone at that point is equal to dS\r\n  cos[theta], and the solid angle d[omega] is equal to dS cos[theta]/x^2.\r\n  Hence the flux through dS is qd[omega]. Accordingly, since the total\r\n  solid angle round a point is 4[pi], it follows that the total flux\r\n  through the closed surface due to the single point charge q is 4[pi]q,\r\n  and what is true for one point charge is true for any collection\r\n  forming a total charge Q of any form. Hence the total electric flux\r\n  due to a charge Q through an enclosing surface is 4[pi]Q, and\r\n  therefore is zero through one enclosing no electricity.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n  Stokes's theorem becomes an obvious truism if applied to an\r\n  incompressible fluid. Let a _source_ of fluid be a point from which an\r\n  incompressible fluid is emitted in all directions. Close to the source\r\n  the stream lines will be radial lines. Let a very small sphere be\r\n  described round the source, and let the strength of the source be\r\n  defined as the total flow per second through the surface of this small\r\n  sphere. Then if we have any number of sources enclosed by any surface,\r\n  the total flow per second through this surface is equal to the total\r\n  strengths of all the sources. If, however, we defined the strength of\r\n  the source by the statement that the strength divided by the square\r\n  of the distance gives the velocity of the liquid at that point, then\r\n  the total flux through any enclosing surface would be 4[pi] times the\r\n  strengths of all the sources enclosed. To every proposition in\r\n  electrostatics there is thus a corresponding one in the hydrokinetic\r\n  theory of incompressible liquids.\r\n\r\n  Let us apply the above theorem to the case of a small\r\n  parallel-epipedon or rectangular prism having sides dx, dy, dz\r\n  respectively, its centre having co-ordinates (x, y, z). Its angular\r\n  points have then co-ordinates (x [+-] 1/2 dx, y [+-] 1/2 dy, z [+-]\r\n  1/2 dz). Let this rectangular prism be supposed to be wholly filled up\r\n  with electricity of density [rho]; then the total quantity in it is\r\n  [rho] dx dy dz. Consider the two faces perpendicular to the x-axis.\r\n  Let V be the potential at the centre of the prism, then the normal\r\n  forces on the two faces of area dy.dx are respectively\r\n\r\n       /dV   1  d^2V   \\       /dV   1  d^2V   \\\r\n    - ( -- + -- ---- dx ) and ( -- - -- ---- dx ),\r\n       \\dx   2  dx^2   /       \\dx   2  dx^2   /\r\n\r\n  and similar expressions for the normal forces to the other pairs of\r\n  faces dx.dy, dz.dx. Hence, multiplying these normal forces by the\r\n  areas of the corresponding faces, we have the total flux parallel to\r\n  the x-axis given by -(d^2V/dx^2)dx dy dz, and similar expressions for\r\n  the other sides. Hence the total flux is\r\n\r\n       /d^2V   d^2V   d^2V\\\r\n    - ( ---- + ---- + ---- ) dx dy dz\r\n       \\dx^2   dy^2   dz^2/\r\n\r\n  and by the previous theorem this must be equal to 4[pi][rho]dx dy dz.\r\n\r\n         d^2V   d^2V   d^2V\r\n  Hence  ---- + ---- + ---- + 4[pi][rho] = 0  (18).\r\n         dx^2   dy^2   dz^2\r\n\r\n  This celebrated equation was first given by S.D. Poisson, although\r\n  previously demonstrated by Laplace for the case when [rho] = 0. It\r\n  defines the condition which must be fulfilled by the potential at any\r\n  and every point in an electric field, through which [rho] is finite\r\n  and the electric force continuous. It may be looked upon as an\r\n  equation to determine [rho] when V is given or vice versa. An exactly\r\n  similar expression holds good in hydrokinetics, provided that for the\r\n  electric potential we substitute velocity potential, and for the\r\n  electric force the velocity of the liquid.\r\n\r\n  The Poisson equation cannot, however, be applied in the above form to\r\n  a region which is partly within and partly without an electrified\r\n  conductor, because then the electric force undergoes a sudden change\r\n  in value from zero to a finite value, in passing outwards through the\r\n  bounding surface of the conductor. We can, however, obtain another\r\n  equation called the \"surface characteristic equation\" as\r\n  follows:--Suppose a very small area dS described on a conductor having\r\n  a surface density of electrification [sigma]. Then let a small, very\r\n  short cylinder be described of which dS is a section, and the\r\n  generating lines are normal to the surface. Let V1 and V2 be the\r\n  potentials at points just outside and inside the surface dS, and let\r\n  n1 and n2 be the normals to the surface dS drawn outwards and inwards;\r\n  then -dV1/dn1 and -dV2/dn2 are the normal components of the force over\r\n  the ends of the imaginary small cylinder. But the force perpendicular\r\n  to the curved surface of this cylinder is everywhere zero. Hence the\r\n  total flux through the surface considered is -{(dV1/dn1) +\r\n  (dV2/dn2)}dS, and this by a previous theorem must be equal to\r\n  4[pi][sigma]dS, or the total included electric quantity. Hence we have\r\n  the surface characteristic equation,[17]\r\n\r\n    (dV1/dn1) + (dV2/dn2) + 4[pi][sigma] = 0  (19).\r\n\r\n  Let us apply these theorems to a portion of a tube of electric force.\r\n  Let the part selected not include any charged surface. Then since the\r\n  generating lines of the tube are lines of force, the component of the\r\n  electric force perpendicular to the curved surface of the tube is\r\n  everywhere zero. But the electric force is normal to the ends of the\r\n  tube. Hence if dS and dS' are the areas of the ends, and +E and -E'\r\n  the oppositely directed electric forces at the ends of the tube, the\r\n  surface integral of normal force on the flux over the tube is\r\n\r\n    EdS - E'dS'  (20),\r\n\r\n  and this by the theorem already given is equal to zero, since the tube\r\n  includes no electricity. Hence the characteristic quality of a tube of\r\n  electric force is that its section is everywhere inversely as the\r\n  electric force at that point. A tube so chosen that EdS for one\r\n  section has a value unity, is called a unit tube, since the product of\r\n  force and section is then everywhere unity for the same tube.\r\n\r\n  In the next place apply the surface characteristic equation to any\r\n  point on a charged conductor at which the surface density is [sigma].\r\n  The electric force outward from that point is -dV/dn, where dn is a\r\n  distance measured along the outwardly drawn normal, and the force\r\n  within the surface is zero. Hence we have\r\n\r\n    -dV/dn = 4.0[pi][sigma] or [sigma] = -(1/4 [pi])dV/dn = E/4[pi].\r\n\r\n  The above is a statement of Coulomb's law, that _the electric force at\r\n  the surface of a conductor is proportional to the surface density of\r\n  the charge at that point and equal to 4[pi] times the density_.[18]\r\n\r\n  If we define the positive direction along a tube of electric force as\r\n  the direction in which a small body charged with positive electricity\r\n  would tend to move, we can summarize the above facts in a simple form\r\n  by saying that, _if we have any closed surface described in any manner\r\n  in an electric field, the excess of the number of unit tubes which\r\n  leave the surface over those which enter it is equal to 4[pi]-times\r\n  the algebraic sum of all the electricity included within the surface_.\r\n\r\n  Every tube of electric force must therefore begin and end on\r\n  electrified surfaces of opposite sign, and the quantities of positive\r\n  and negative electricity on its two ends are equal, since the force E\r\n  just outside an electrified surface is normal to it and equal to\r\n  [sigma]/4[pi], where [sigma] is the surface density; and since we have\r\n  just proved that for the ends of a tube of force EdS = E^1dS', it\r\n  follows that [sigma]dS = [sigma]'dS', or Q = Q', where Q and Q' are\r\n  the quantities of electricity on the ends of the tube of force.\r\n  Accordingly, since every tube sent out from a charged conductor must\r\n  end somewhere on another charge of opposite sign, it follows that the\r\n  two electricities always exist in equal quantity, and that it is\r\n  impossible to create any quantity of one kind without creating an\r\n  equal quantity of the opposite sign.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n  We have next to consider the energy storage which takes place when\r\n  electric charge is created, i.e. when the dielectric is strained or\r\n  polarized. Since the potential of a conductor is defined to be the\r\n  work required to move a unit of positive electricity from the surface\r\n  of the earth or from an infinite distance from all electricity to the\r\n  surface of the conductor, it follows that the work done in putting a\r\n  small charge dq into a conductor at a potential v is v dq. Let us then\r\n  suppose that a conductor originally at zero potential has its\r\n  potential raised by administering to it small successive doses of\r\n  electricity dq. The first raises its potential to v, the second to v'\r\n  and so on, and the nth to V. Take any horizontal line and divide it\r\n  into small elements of length each representing dq, and draw vertical\r\n  lines representing the potentials v, v', &c., and after each dose.\r\n  Since the potential rises proportionately to the quantity in the\r\n  conductor, the ends of these ordinates will lie on a straight line and\r\n  define a triangle whose base line is a length equal to the total\r\n  quantity Q and height a length equal to the final potential V. The\r\n  element of work done in introducing the quantity of electricity dq at\r\n  a potential v is represented by the element of area of this triangle\r\n  (see fig. 4), and hence the work done in charging the conductor with\r\n  quantity Q to final potential V is 1/2 QV, or since Q = CV, where C is\r\n  its capacity, the work done is represented by 1/2 CV^2 or by 1/2 Q^2/C.\r\n\r\n  If [sigma] is the surface density and dS an element of surface, then\r\n  [int][sigma]dS is the whole charge, and hence 1/2 [int] V[sigma]dS is\r\n  the expression for the energy of charge of a conductor.\r\n\r\n  We can deduce a remarkable expression for the energy stored up in an\r\n  electric field containing electrified bodies as follows:[19] Let V\r\n  denote the potential at any point in the field. Consider the integral\r\n               _ _ _  _                         _\r\n          1   / / /  | /dV\\^2    /dV\\^2   /dV\\^2 |\r\n    W = ----- | | |  |(----) +  (----) + (----)  | dx dy dz.

Let E be the resultant electric\r\n                   dx^2   dy^2   dz^2\r\n\r\n  force at any point in the field. Then bearing in mind that [sigma] =\r\n  (1/4 [pi])dV/dn, and [rho] = -(1/4 [pi])[nabla]V, we have finally\r\n            _ _ _             _ _                  _ _ _\r\n      1    / / /         1   / /              1   / / /\r\n    -----  | | | E^2dv = --  | | V[sigma]dS + --  | | | V[rho]dv.\r\n    8[pi] _/_/_/         2  _/_/              2  _/_/_/\r\n\r\n  The first term on the right hand side expresses the energy of the\r\n  surface electrification of the conductors in the field, and the second\r\n  the energy of volume density (if any). Accordingly the term on the\r\n  left hand side gives us the whole energy in the field.\r\n\r\n  Suppose that the dielectric has a constant K, then we must multiply\r\n  both sides by K and the expression for the energy per unit of volume\r\n  of the field is equivalent to 1/2 DE where D is the displacement or\r\n  polarization in the dielectric.\r\n\r\n  Furthermore it can be shown by the application of the calculus of\r\n  variations that the condition for a minimum value of the function W,\r\n  is that [nabla]V = 0. Hence that distribution of potential which is\r\n  necessary to satisfy Laplace's equation is also one which makes the\r\n  potential energy a minimum and therefore the energy stable. Thus the\r\n  actual distribution of electricity on the conductor in the field is\r\n  not merely a stable distribution, it is _the only_ possible stable\r\n  distribution.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n  _Method of Electrical Images._--A very powerful method of attacking\r\n  problems in electrical distribution was first made known by Lord\r\n  Kelvin in 1845 and is described as the method of electrical\r\n  images.[20] By older mathematical methods it had only been possible to\r\n  predict in a few simple cases the distribution of electricity at rest\r\n  on conductors of various forms. The notion of an electrical image may\r\n  be easily grasped by the following illustration: Let there be at A\r\n  (see fig. 5) a point-charge of positive electricity +q and an infinite\r\n  conducting plate PO, shown in section, connected to earth and\r\n  therefore at zero potential. Then the charge at A together with the\r\n  induced surface charge on the plate makes a certain field of electric\r\n  force on the left of the plate PO, which is a zero equipotential\r\n  surface. If we remove the plate, and yet by any means can keep the\r\n  identical surface occupied by it a plane of zero potential, the\r\n  boundary conditions will remain the same, and therefore the field of\r\n  force to the left of PO will remain unaltered. This can be done by\r\n  placing at B an equal negative point-charge -q in the place which\r\n  would be occupied by the optical image of A if PO were a mirror, that\r\n  is, let -q be placed at B, so that the distance BO is equal to the\r\n  distance AO, whilst AOB is at right angles to PO. Then the potential\r\n  at any point P in this ideal plane PO is equal to q/AP - q/BP = O,\r\n  whilst the resultant force at P due to the two point charges is\r\n  2qAO/AP^3, and is parallel to AB or normal to PO. Hence if we remove\r\n  the charge -q at B and distribute electricity over the surface PO with\r\n  a surface density [sigma], according to the Coulomb-Poisson law,\r\n  [sigma] = qAO/2[pi]AP^3, the field of force to the left of PD will\r\n  fulfil the required boundary conditions, and hence will be the law of\r\n  distribution of the induced electricity in the case of the actual\r\n  plate. The point-charge -q at B is called the \"electrical image\" of\r\n  the point-charge +q at A.\r\n\r\n  We find a precisely analogous effect in optics which justifies the\r\n  term \"electrical image.\" Suppose a room lit by a single candle. There\r\n  is everywhere a certain illumination due to it. Place across the room\r\n  a plane mirror. All the space behind the mirror will become dark, and\r\n  all the space in front of the mirror will acquire an exalted\r\n  illumination. Whatever this increased illumination may be, it can be\r\n  precisely imitated by removing the mirror and placing a second lighted\r\n  candle at the place occupied by the optical image of the first candle\r\n  in the mirror, that is, as far behind the plane as the first candle\r\n  was in front. So the potential distribution in the space due to the\r\n  electric point-charge +q as A together with -q at B is the same as\r\n  that due to +q at A and the negative induced charge erected on the\r\n  infinite plane (earthed) metal sheet placed half-way between A and B.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n  The same reasoning can be applied to determine the electrical image of\r\n  a point-charge of positive electricity in a spherical surface, and\r\n  therefore the distribution of induced electricity over a metal sphere\r\n  connected to earth produced by a point-charge near it. Let +q be any\r\n  positive point-charge placed at a point A outside a sphere (fig. 6) of\r\n  radius r, and centre at C, and let P be any point on it. Let CA = d.\r\n  Take a point B in CA such that CB.CA = r^2, or CB = r^2/d. It is easy\r\n  then to show that PA : PB = d : r. If then we put a negative\r\n  point-charge -qr/d at B, it follows that the spherical surface will be\r\n  a zero potential surface, for\r\n\r\n    q/PA - rq/d . 1/PB = 0  (24).\r\n\r\n  Another equipotential surface is evidently a very small sphere\r\n  described round A. The resultant force due to these two point-charges\r\n  must then be in the direction CP, and its value E is the vector sum of\r\n  the two forces along AP and BP due to the two point-charges. It is not\r\n  difficult to show that\r\n\r\n    E = -(d^2 - r^2)q/rAP^3  (25),\r\n\r\n  in other words, the force at P is inversely as the cube of the\r\n  distance from A. Suppose then we remove the negative point-charge, and\r\n  let the sphere be supposed to become conductive and be connected to\r\n  earth. If we make a distribution of negative electricity over it,\r\n  which has a density [sigma] varying according to the law\r\n\r\n    [sigma] = -(d^2 - r^2)q/4[pi]rAP^3  (26),\r\n\r\n  that distribution, together with the point-charge +q at A, will make a\r\n  distribution of electric force at all points outside the sphere\r\n  exactly similar to that which would exist if the sphere were removed\r\n  and a negative point charge -qr/d were placed at B. Hence this charge\r\n  is the electrical image of the charge +q at A in the spherical\r\n  surface.\r\n\r\n  We may generalize these statements in the following theorem, which is\r\n  an important deduction from a wider theorem due to G. Green. Suppose\r\n  that we have any distribution of electricity at rest over conductors,\r\n  and that we know the potential at all points and consequently the\r\n  level or equipotential surfaces. Take any equipotential surface\r\n  enclosing the whole of the electricity, and suppose this to become an\r\n  actual sheet of metal connected to the earth. It is then a zero\r\n  potential surface, and every point outside is at zero potential as far\r\n  as concerns the electric charge on the conductors inside. Then if U is\r\n  the potential outside the surface due to this electric charge inside\r\n  alone, and V that due to the opposite charge it induces on the inside\r\n  of the metal surface, we must have U + V = 0 or U = -V at all points\r\n  outside the earthed metal surface. Therefore, whatever may be the\r\n  distribution of electric force produced by the charges inside taken\r\n  alone, it can be exactly imitated for all space outside the metal\r\n  surface if we suppose the inside charge removed and a distribution of\r\n  electricity of the same sign made over the metal surface such that its\r\n  density follows the law\r\n\r\n    [sigma]= -(1/4 [pi])dU/dn  (27),\r\n\r\n  where dU/dn is the electric force at that point on the closed\r\n  equipotential surface considered, due to the original charge alone.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--For further developments of the subject we must refer\r\n  the reader to the numerous excellent treatises on electrostatics now\r\n  available. The student will find it to be a great advantage to read\r\n  through Faraday's three volumes entitled _Experimental Researches on\r\n  Electricity_, as soon as he has mastered some modern elementary book\r\n  giving in compact form a general account of electrical phenomena. For\r\n  this purpose he may select from the following books: J. Clerk Maxwell,\r\n  _Elementary Treatise on Electricity_ (Oxford, 1881); J.J. Thomson,\r\n  _Elements of the Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism_\r\n  (Cambridge, 1895); J.D. Everett, _Electricity_, founded on part iii.\r\n  of Deschanel's _Natural Philosophy_ (London, 1901); G.C. Foster and\r\n  A.W. Porter, _Elementary Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism_\r\n  (London, 1903); S.P. Thompson, _Elementary Lessons on Electricity and\r\n  Magnetism_ (London, 1903).\r\n\r\n  When these elementary books have been digested, the advanced student\r\n  may proceed to study the following: J. Clerk Maxwell, _A Treatise on\r\n  Electricity and Magnetism_ (1st ed., Oxford, 1873; 2nd ed. by W.D.\r\n  Niven, 1881; 3rd ed. by J.J.

In the collected\r\n  _Scientific Papers_ of Lord Kelvin (3 vols., Cambridge, 1882), of\r\n  James Clerk Maxwell (2 vols., Cambridge, 1890), and of Lord Rayleigh\r\n  (4 vols., Cambridge, 1903), the advanced student will find the means\r\n  for studying the historical development of electrical knowledge as it\r\n  has been evolved from the minds of some of the master workers of the\r\n  19th century.

It arises from the manner in\r\n    which the unit quantity of electricity is defined. The electric force\r\n    due to a point-charge q at a distance r is defined to be q/r^2, and\r\n    the total flux or induction through the sphere of radius r is\r\n    therefore 4[pi]q. If, however, the unit point charge were defined to\r\n    be that which produces a unit of electric flux through a\r\n    circumscribing spherical surface or the electric force at distance r\r\n    defined to be 1/4 [pi]r^2, many theorems would be enunciated in\r\n    simpler forms.\r\n\r\n  [17] See Maxwell, _Electricity and Magnetism_, vol. i. S 78b (2nd\r\n    ed.).\r\n\r\n  [18] Id. ib. vol. i. S 80. Coulomb proved the proportionality of\r\n    electric surface force to density, but the above numerical relation E\r\n    = 4[pi][sigma] was first established by Poisson.\r\n\r\n  [19] See Maxwell, _Electricity and Magnetism_, vol. i. S 99a (3rd\r\n    ed., 1892), where the expression in question is deduced as a\r\n    corollary of Green's theorem.\r\n\r\n  [20] See Lord Kelvin's _Papers on Electrostatics and Magnetism_, p.\r\n    144.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTROTHERAPEUTICS, a general term for the use of electricity in\r\ntherapeutics, i.e. in the alleviation and cure of disease. Before the\r\ndifferent forms of medical treatment are dealt with, a few points in\r\nconnexion with the machines and currents, of special interest to the\r\nmedical reader, must first be given.\r\n\r\n_Faradism._--For the battery required either for faradism or galvanism,\r\ncells of the Leclanche type are the most satisfactory. Being dry they\r\ncan be carried in any position, are lighter, and there is no trouble\r\nfrom the erosion of wires and binding screws, such as so often results\r\nfrom wet cells. The best method of producing a smooth current in the\r\nsecondary coil is for the interruptor hammer to vibrate directly against\r\nthe iron core of the primary coil. For this it is best that the\r\ninterruptor be made of a piece of steel spring, as a high rate of\r\ninterruption can then be maintained, with a fairly smooth current in the\r\nsecondary coil. This form of interruptor necessitates that the iron core\r\nbe fixed, and variation in the primary induced current is arranged for\r\nby slipping a brass tube more or less over the iron core, thus cutting\r\noff the magnetic field from the primary coil. The secondary current\r\n(that obtained from the secondary coil) can be varied by keeping the\r\nsecondary coil permanently fixed over the primary and varying the\r\nstrength of the primary current. Where, as suggested above, the iron\r\ncore is fixed, the primary and secondary induced currents will be at\r\ntheir strongest when the brass tube is completely withdrawn. As there is\r\nno simple means of measuring the strength of the faradic current, it is\r\nbest to start with a very weak current, testing it on the muscles of\r\none's own hand until these begin to contract and a definite sensory\r\neffect is produced; the current can then be applied to the part, being\r\nstrengthened only very gradually.\r\n\r\n_Galvanism._--For treatment by galvanism a large battery is needed, the\r\nsimplest form being known as a \"patient's battery,\" consisting of a\r\nvariable number of dry cells arranged in series. The cells used are\r\nthose of Leclanche, with E.M.F. (or voltage) of 1.5 and an internal\r\nresistance of .3 ohm. Thus the exact strength of the current is known;\r\nthe number of cells usually employed is 24, and when new give an E.M.F.\r\nof about 36 volts. By using the formula C = E/R, where E is the voltage\r\nof the battery, R the total resistance of battery, electrodes and the\r\npatient's skin and tissues, and C the current in amperes, the number of\r\ncells required for any particular current can be worked out. The\r\nresistance of the patient's skin must be made as low as possible by\r\nthoroughly wetting both skin and electrodes with sodium bicarbonate\r\nsolution, and keeping the electrodes in very close apposition to the\r\nskin. A galvanometer is always fitted to the battery, usually of the\r\nd'Arsonval type, with a shunt by means of which, on turning a screw,\r\nnine-tenths of the inducing current can be short-circuited away, and the\r\nsolenoid only influenced by one-tenth of the current which is being used\r\non the patient. In districts where electric power is available the\r\ncontinuous current can be used by means of a switchboard. A current of\r\nmuch value for electrotherapeutic purposes is the sinusoidal current, by\r\nwhich is meant an alternating current whose curve of electromotive\r\nforce, in both positive and negative phase, varies constantly and\r\nsmoothly in what is known as the sine curve. In those districts supplied\r\nby an alternating current, the sinusoidal current can be obtained from\r\nthe mains by passing it through various transformers, but where the main\r\nsupply is the direct or constant current, a motor transformer is needed.\r\n\r\n_Static Electricity._--For treatment by static electricity the Wimshurst\r\ntype of machine is the one most generally used. A number of electrodes\r\nare required; thus for the application of sparks a brass ball and brass\r\nroller electrode, for the \"breeze\" a single point and a multiple point\r\nelectrode, and another multiple point electrode in the form of a metal\r\ncap that can be placed over the patient's head. The polarity of the\r\nmachine must always be tested, as either knob may become positive or\r\nnegative, though the polarity rarely changes when once the machine is in\r\naction. The oldest method of subjecting a patient to electric influence\r\nis that in which static electricity is employed. The patient is\r\ninsulated on a suitable platform and treated by means of charges and\r\ndischarges from an electrical machine. The effect is to increase the\r\nregularity and frequency of the pulse, raise the blood pressure and\r\nincrease the action of the skin. The nervous system is quieted, sleep\r\nbeing promoted, the patient often becoming drowsy during the\r\napplication. If while the patient is being treated a point electrode is\r\nbrought towards him he feels the sensation of a wind blowing from that\r\npoint; this is an electric breeze or brush discharge. The breeze is\r\nnegative if the patient is positively charged and vice versa. The\r\n\"breeze discharge\" treatment is especially valuable in subduing pain of\r\nthe superficial cutaneous nerves, and also in the treatment of chronic\r\nindolent ulcers. Quite recently this form of treatment has been applied\r\nwith much success to various skin lesions--psoriasis, eczema and\r\npruritus. Static electricity is also utilized for medical purposes by\r\nmeans of \"sparks,\" which are administered with a ball electrode, the\r\nresult being a sudden muscular contraction at the point of application.\r\nThe electrode must be rapidly withdrawn before a second spark has time\r\nto leap across, as this is a severe form of treatment and must be\r\nadministered slowly. It is mainly employed for muscular stimulation, and\r\nthe contractions resulting from spark stimulation can be produced in\r\ncases of nerve injury and degeneration, even when the muscles have lost\r\ntheir reaction to faradism. The sensory stimulation of this form of\r\ntreatment is also strong, and is useful in hysterical anaesthesia and\r\nfunctional paralysis. Where a milder sensory stimulation is required\r\nfriction can be used, the electrode being in the form of a metal roller\r\nwhich is moved rapidly outside the patient's clothing over the spine or\r\nother part to be treated. The clothing must be dry and of wool, and each\r\nadditional woollen layer intensifies the effect.\r\n\r\nAnother method of employing electricity at high potential is by the\r\nemployment of high frequency currents. There are two methods of\r\napplication: that in which brush discharges are made use of, with\r\nundoubtedly good effects in many of the diseases affecting the surface\r\nof the body, and that in which the currents of the solenoid are made to\r\ntraverse the patient directly. The physiological value of the latter\r\nmethod is not certain, though one point of interest in connexion with it\r\nis that whereas statical applications raise the blood pressure, high\r\nfrequency applications lower it. It has been used in the case of old\r\npeople with arterio-sclerosis, and the reduction of blood pressure\r\nproduced is said to have shown considerable permanence.\r\n\r\n_The Faradic Current._--G.B. Duchenne was the first physician to make\r\nuse of the induced current for treatment, and the term \"faradization\" is\r\nsupposed to be due to him. But in his day the differences between the\r\ntwo currents available, the primary and the secondary, were not worked\r\nout, and they were used somewhat indiscriminately. Nowadays it is\r\ngenerally accepted that the primary current should be used for the\r\nstimulation of deep-lying organs, as stomach and intestines, &c., while\r\nthe secondary current is employed for stimulation of the limb muscles\r\nand the cutaneous sensory nerves. The faradic current is also used as a\r\nmeans of diagnosis for neuro-muscular conditions. When the interrupted\r\ncurrent is used to stimulate the skin over a motor nerve, all the\r\nmuscles supplied by that nerve are thrown into rapid tetanic\r\ncontraction, the contraction both beginning and ceasing sharply and\r\nsuddenly with the current. This is the normal reaction of the nerve to\r\nfaradism. If the muscle be wasted from disuse or some local cause\r\nunconnected with its nerve-supply, the contraction is smaller, and both\r\narises and relaxes more slowly. But if the lesion lies in the nerve\r\nitself, as in Bell's palsy, the muscles no longer show any response when\r\nthe nerve is stimulated, and this is known as the reaction of\r\ndegeneration in the nerve. It is usually preceded by a condition of\r\nhyperexcitability. These results are applied to distinguish between\r\nfunctional paralysis and that due to some organic lesion, as in the\r\nformer case the reaction of faradism will be as brisk as usual. Also at\r\nthe beginning of most cases of infantile paralysis many more groups of\r\nmuscles appear to be affected than ultimately prove to be, and faradism\r\nenables the physician to distinguish between those groups of muscles\r\nthat are permanently paralysed owing to the destruction of their trophic\r\ncentre, and those muscles which are only temporarily inhibited from\r\nshock, and which with proper treatment will later regain their full\r\npower. In the testing of muscles electrically that point on the skin\r\nwhich on stimulation gives the maximum contraction for that muscle is\r\nknown as the \"motor point\" for that muscle. It usually corresponds to\r\nthe entry of the motor nerve. Faradic treatment may be employed in the\r\nweakness and emaciation depending on any long illness, rickets, anaemia,\r\n&c. For these cases it is best to use the electric bath, the patient\r\nbeing placed in warm water, and the two electrodes, one at the patient's\r\nback and the other at his feet, being connected with the secondary coil.\r\nThe patient's general metabolism is stimulated, he eats and sleeps\r\nbetter and soon begins to put on weight. This is especially beneficial\r\nin severe cases of rickets. In the weakness and emaciation due to\r\nneurasthenia, especially in those cases being treated by the Weir\r\nMitchell method (isolation, absolute confinement to bed, massage and\r\noverfeeding), a similar faradic bath is a very helpful adjunct. In tabes\r\ndorsalis faradic treatment will often diminish the anaesthesia and\r\nnumbness in the legs, with resulting benefit to the ataxy. Perhaps the\r\nmost beneficial use of the faradic current is in the treatment of\r\nchronic constipation--especially that so frequently met with in young\r\nwomen and due to deficient muscular power of the intestinal walls. In\r\nlong-standing cases the large intestine becomes permanently dilated, and\r\nits muscular fibres so attenuated as to have no power over the\r\nintestinal contents. But faradism causes contraction at the point of\r\nstimulation, and the peristaltic wave thus started slowly progresses\r\nalong the bowel. All that is needed is a special electrode for\r\nintroduction into the bowel and an ordinary roller electrode. The rectal\r\nelectrode consists of a 6-inch wire bearing at one end a small metal\r\nknob and fitted at the other into a metal cup which screws into the\r\nhandle of the electrode. The only part exposed is the metallic knob; the\r\nrest is coated with some insulating material. The patient reclines on a\r\ncouch on his back, the rectal electrode is connected, and having been\r\nvaselined is passed some three inches into the rectum. A current is\r\nstarted with the secondary coil in such a position as to give only an\r\nextremely weak current. The roller electrode is then wetted with hot\r\nwater and applied to the front of the abdomen. At first the patient\r\nshould feel nothing, but the current should slowly be increased until a\r\nfaint response is perceptible from the abdominal muscles. This gives the\r\nrequired strength, and the roller electrode, pressed well into the\r\nabdominal wall, should very slowly be moved along the course of the\r\nlarge intestine beginning at the right iliac fossa. Thus a combination\r\nof massage and faradic current is obtained, and the results are\r\nparticularly satisfactory. Treatment should be given on alternate days\r\nimmediately after breakfast, and should be persevered with for six or\r\neight weeks. The patient can be taught to administer it to himself.\r\n\r\n_The Galvanic, Continuous or Direct Current._--In using the galvanic or\r\ndirect current the electrode must be covered with padded webbing or some\r\nother absorbent material, the metal of the electrode never being allowed\r\nto come in contact with the skin. The padding by retaining moisture\r\nhelps to make good contact, and also helps to guard against burning the\r\nskin. But when a continuous current of 3 am. or more is passed for more\r\nthan 5 min. the electrodes must be raised periodically and the skin\r\ninspected. If the current be too strong or applied for too long a time,\r\nsmall blisters are raised which break and are very troublesome to heal.\r\nNor does the patient always feel much pain when this occurs. Also the\r\nelectrodes must be remoistened every five or six minutes, as they soon\r\nbecome dry, and the skin will then be burnt. It is best to use a\r\nsolution of sodium bicarbonate. Again, the danger of burning the skin\r\ndepends on the density of the current per sq. in. of electrode, so that\r\na strong current through a small electrode will burn the skin, whereas\r\nthe same current through a larger electrode will produce a beneficial\r\neffect. If the patient be immersed up to his neck in an electric bath,\r\nmuch stronger currents can be passed without causing either pain or\r\ninjury, as in this case the whole area of the skin in contact with the\r\nwater acts as an electrode. In passing the current it must be remembered\r\nthat the negative electrode or kathode is the more painful of the two,\r\nand its action more stimulating than the positive electrode or anode,\r\nwhich is sedative. If a muscle be stimulated over its motor point, it\r\nwill contract with a sharp twitch and then become quiescent. With normal\r\nmuscle the KCC (kathodal closure contraction) is stronger than that\r\nproduced by the closure of the current at the anode ACC (anodal closure\r\ncontraction). And if the muscle be normal the opening contraction KOC\r\nand AOC are not seen. When a galvanic current is passed along a nerve\r\nits excitability is increased at the kathode and diminished at the\r\nanode. The increased excitability at the kathode is katelectrotonus, and\r\nthe lowered excitability at the anode anelectrotonus. But since in a\r\npatient the electrode cannot be applied directly to the nerve, the lines\r\nof force from the electrode pass into the nerve both in an upward and\r\ndownward direction, and hence there are two poles produced by each\r\nelectrode. If the current be suddenly reversed, so that what was the\r\nanode becomes the kathode, a stronger contraction is obtained than by\r\nsimply making and breaking the current. To avoid the four poles on the\r\nnerve to be tested, it is found most satisfactory to have one electrode\r\nplaced at some distance, on the back or chest, not on the same limb.\r\n\r\nAs explained above, when the nerve supplying a muscle is diseased it no\r\nlonger responds to the faradic current. On further testing this with the\r\ngalvanic or continuous current it responds, but the contraction is not\r\nbrisk but begins slowly and relaxes slowly, though the contraction as a\r\nwhole may be larger than that of a normal muscle. This excessive\r\ncontraction is known as hyperexcitability to galvanism. This form of\r\ncontraction is that obtained when the muscle fibre itself is stimulated.\r\nAgain, whereas in normal muscle KCC > ACC, when the nerve is degenerated\r\nKCC = ACC or ACC > KCC. Also in the more severe forms of nerve injury\r\ntetanic contractions may be set up in the paralysed muscles, by closure\r\nof the current either at the anode or kathode. These charges are known\r\nas the reaction of degeneration or RD, and are of great value in\r\ndiagnosis. They occur only after sudden or acute damage to the nerve\r\ncells of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, or to the motor nerve\r\nfibres proceeding from these cells. Thus RD is present in infantile\r\nparalysis, acute neuritis, &c., but absent in progressive muscular\r\natrophy where the wasting of nerve and muscle takes place extremely\r\nslowly. The reaction of degeneration in the nerve is shown by\r\ndisappearance of reaction to either kind of current, preceded for some\r\ndays by hyperexcitability to either current. Where the muscle wasting is\r\ndue to a lesion in the muscle alone, as in ischaemic myositis (usually\r\ndue to injury from tight bandaging or badly applied splints), no\r\nreaction of degeneration is found; the only change is a loss of power in\r\nthe contraction. If the damage to the anterior horn cells be only very\r\nslight, there may only be partial RD, and the prognosis is given\r\naccording to the extent of RD. From this account it is clear that the\r\ngreatest value of the continuous current lies in its use in diagnosis.\r\nBut it is also applied extremely successfully, in combination with\r\nmassage, to cases of infantile paralysis. Wrist drop from lead poisoning\r\nand lead neuritis of all kinds, reflex muscular atrophy and the muscular\r\nwasting of hemiplegia, are all benefited by the continuous current; the\r\nsevere pain of sciatica, and the inflammation of the nerve sheath in\r\nthese cases, can be arrested more quickly by galvanic treatment than in\r\nany other way. Nearly all forms of neuritis, both of the cranial and\r\nother nerves, are best treated by the continuous current. The action in\r\nall cases is to stimulate the natural tendency to repair, very largely\r\nby improving the circulation through the injured parts.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of an electric current is electrolysis, and the phenomena\r\nof electrolytic conduction involve not merely the ionization of the\r\ncompounds, but also the setting in motion of the ions towards their\r\nrespective poles. Solutions which conduct electric currents are called\r\nelectrolytes, and in the case of the human body the electrolyte is the\r\nwhole mass of the saline constituents in solution throughout the body.\r\nWhen a current is passed through an electrolyte, dissociation into ions\r\ntakes place, the ions which are freed round the anode being called\r\nanions and those which are freed round the kathode being called kations.\r\nThe anions carry negative charges and are consequently attracted by the\r\npositive electricity of the anode. The kations carry positive charges,\r\nhence they are repelled by the anode and attracted by the kathode. But a\r\ncertain number of molecules do not dissociate, and hence in an\r\nelectrolytic solution there are neutral molecules, anions and kations.\r\nThe chemical actions, and thus the antiseptic, remedial or toxic effects\r\nof electrolytes, are due to the actions of their ions. The phosphides\r\nand phosphates may be taken as examples. Some are extremely toxic, while\r\nothers are quite harmless. But it is to the phosphorus ion that the\r\ntoxic or therapeutic effect is due. In the phosphates the phosphorus is\r\npart of a complex ion possessing quite different properties to those of\r\nthe phosphorus ion of the phosphides. The strikingly different effects\r\nof the sulphates and sulphides are due to similar conditions, as also of\r\nmany other compounds. There are certain solvents, as alcohol,\r\nchloroform, glycerin and vaseline which do not dissociate electrolytes,\r\nand consequently the latter become inert when mixed with these solvents.\r\nThese solutions do not conduct electricity, and hence ionic effects are\r\nextremely slow. A vaseline ointment containing 5% of phenol makes a good\r\ndressing for an ulcer of the leg, and produces no irritant effect, but a\r\n5% aqueous solution may be both caustic and toxic. Since the toxic or\r\ntherapeutic action of a solution is due to its ions, the action must be\r\nproportional to the number of ions in a given volume, that is, the\r\naction of an electrolyte depends on the degree of dissociation. Thus a\r\nstrong acid is one that is much dissociated, a weak acid one that has\r\nundergone but little dissociation and so on. In 1896-1897 it was shown\r\nthat the bactericidal action of salts varies with their degree of\r\ndissociation and therefore depends on the concentration of the active\r\nions. In the medical application of these facts it must be remembered\r\nthat when an ion is introduced into the body by electrolysis, it is\r\nprobably forced into the actual cellular constituents of the body,\r\nwhereas the drug administered by one of the usual methods though\r\ncirculating in the blood may perhaps never gain access to the cell\r\nitself. Hence the different effects that have been recorded between a\r\ndrug administered by the mouth or subcutaneously and the same\r\nadministered by electrolysis. Thus a solution of cocaine injected\r\nsubcutaneously produces quite different effects to that introduced by\r\nelectrolysis. By the latter method it produces anaesthesia but does not\r\ndiffuse, and the anaesthesia remains strictly limited to the surface\r\ncovered by the electrode. It would appear that the ion is never\r\nintroduced into the general circulation but into the cell plasma.\r\n\r\nIn the technical working of medical electrolysis the most minute\r\nprecautions are required. The solution of the drug must be made with as\r\npure water as possible, recently distilled. The spongy substance forming\r\nthe electrode must be free from any trace of electrolytic substances.\r\nHence all materials used must be washed in distilled water. Absorbent\r\ncotton answers all requirements and is easily procured. The area of\r\nintroduction can be exactly circumscribed by cutting a hole in a sheet\r\nof adhesive plaster which is applied to the skin and on which the\r\nelectrolytic electrodes are pressed. The great advantage of electrolytic\r\nmethods is that it enables general treatment to be replaced by a\r\nstrictly local treatment, and the cells can be saturated exactly to the\r\ndegree and depth required. Strong antiseptics and materials that\r\ncoagulate albumen cannot be introduced locally by ordinary methods, as\r\nthe skin is impermeable to them, but by electrolysis they can be\r\nintroduced to the exact depth required. The local effects of the ions\r\ndepend on the dosage; thus a feeble dose of the ions of zinc stimulates\r\nthe growth of hair, but a stronger dose produces the death of the\r\ntissue. Naturally the different ions produce different effects. Thus the\r\nions of the alkalis and magnesium are caustic, those of the alkaline\r\nearthy metals produce actual mortification of the tissue and so on.\r\nAccording to the ion chosen the effect may be caustic in various\r\ndegrees, antiseptic, coagulating, producing vascular or nervous changes,\r\n&c., &c. And again electrolysis can also be used for extracting from the\r\nbody such ions as are injurious, as uric and oxalic acid from a patient\r\nsuffering from gout.\r\n\r\nOne of the latest advances is the treatment of ankylosed joints by the\r\nelectrolytic method, the electrolyte used being chloride of sodium, and\r\nthe marvellous results being attributed to the introduction of the\r\nchlorine ions. This sclerolytic property of the current is applicable to\r\nall parts of the body accessible to the current. Old cases of rheumatic\r\nscleritis, entirely unaffected by the routine treatment of salicylates\r\nand iodide, have often cleared up entirely under electrolytic treatment.\r\nCases of chronic iritis with adhesions and old pleural adhesions are\r\nalso suited for this method of procedure. Certain menstrual troubles of\r\nwomen and also endometritis yield rapidly to electrolysis with a zinc\r\nanode. Before this method of introduction, the zinc salts, though\r\nexcellent disinfectants, acted only on the surface in consequence of\r\ntheir coagulating action on the albuminoids, but by the electric\r\ncurrent, under the influence of a difference of potential, the zinc iron\r\nwill penetrate to any desired depth. Cases of rodent ulcer unaffected by\r\nall other methods of treatment have been cured by electric kataphoresis\r\nwith zinc ions, and the method is now being applied to the treatment of\r\ninoperable malignant tumours. As very strong currents are required for\r\nthis latter, the patient has first to be anaesthetized by a general\r\nanaesthetic. Another direction in which electric ions are being used is\r\nthat of the induction of local anaesthesia before minor surgical\r\noperations. Cocaine is the drug used, the resulting anaesthesia is\r\nabsolute, and the operation can be made almost bloodless by the\r\nadmixture of suprarenal extract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTROTYPING, an application of the art of electroplating (q.v.) to\r\ntypography (q.v.). In copying engraved plates for printing purposes,\r\ncopper may be deposited upon the original plate, the surface of which is\r\nfirst rendered slightly dirty, by means of a weak solution of wax in\r\nturpentine or otherwise, to prevent adhesion. The reversed plate thus\r\nproduced is then stripped from the first and used as cathode in its\r\nturn, with the result that even the finest lines of the original are\r\nfaithfully reproduced. The electrolyte commonly contains about 1-1/2 lb.\r\nof copper sulphate and 1/2 lb. of strong sulphuric acid per gallon, and\r\nis worked with a current density of about 10 amperes per sq. ft., which\r\nshould give a thickness of 0.000563 in. of copper per hour. As time is\r\nan object, the conditions alluded to in the article on COPPER as being\r\nfavourable to the use of high current densities should be studied,\r\nbearing in mind that a tough copper deposit of high quality is\r\nessential. Moulds for reproducing plates or art-work are often taken in\r\nplaster, beeswax mixed with Venice turpentine, fusible metal, or\r\ngutta-percha, and the surface being rendered conductive by powdered\r\nblack-lead, copper is deposited upon it evenly throughout. For statuary,\r\nand \"undercut\" work generally, an elastic mould--of glue and treacle\r\n(80:20 parts)--may be used; the mould, when set, is waterproofed by\r\nimmersion in a solution of potassium bichromate followed by exposure to\r\nsunlight, or in some other way. The best results, however, are obtained\r\nby taking a wax cast from the elastic mould, and then from this a\r\nplaster mould, which may be waterproofed with wax, black-leaded, and\r\nused as cathode. In art-work of this nature the principal points to be\r\nlooked to in depositing are the electrical connexions to the cathode,\r\nthe shape of the anode (to secure uniformity of deposition), the\r\ncirculation of the electrolyte, and, in some cases, the means for escape\r\nof anode oxygen. Silver electrotyping is occasionally resorted to for\r\nspecial purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRUM, ELECTRON (Gr. _[Greek: elektron]_, amber), an alloy of gold\r\nand silver in use among the ancients, described by Pliny as containing\r\none part of silver to four of gold. The term is also applied in\r\nmineralogy to native argentiferous gold containing from 20 to 50% of\r\nsilver. In both cases the name is derived from the pale yellow colour of\r\nelectrum, resembling that of amber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEGIT (Lat. for \"he has chosen\"), in English law, a judicial writ of\r\nexecution, given by the Statute of Westminster II. (1285), and so called\r\nfrom the words of the writ, that the plaintiff has chosen (_elegit_)\r\nthis mode of satisfaction. Previously to the Statute of Westminster II.,\r\na judgment creditor could only have the profits of lands of a debtor in\r\nsatisfaction of his judgment, but not the possession of the lands\r\nthemselves. But this statute provided that henceforth it should be _in\r\nthe election_ of the party having recovered judgment to have a writ of\r\n_fieri facias_ (q.v.) unto the sheriff on lands and goods or else all\r\nthe chattels of the debtor and the one half of his lands until the\r\njudgment be satisfied. Since the Bankruptcy Act 1883 the writ of\r\n_elegit_ has extended to lands and hereditaments only. (See further\r\nEXECUTION.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEGY, a short poem of lamentation or regret, called forth by the\r\ndecease of a beloved or revered person, or by a general sense of the\r\npathos of mortality. The Greek word _[Greek: elegeia]_ is of doubtful\r\nsignification; it is usually interpreted as meaning a mournful or\r\nfuneral song. But there seems to be no proof that this idea of regret\r\nfor death entered into the original meaning of _[Greek: elegeia]_. The\r\nearliest Greek elegies which have come down to us are not funereal,\r\nalthough it is possible that the primitive _[Greek: elegeia]_ may have\r\nbeen a set of words liturgically used, with music, at a burial. When the\r\nelegy appears in surviving Greek literature, we find it dedicated, not\r\nto death, but to war and love. Callinus of Ephesus, who flourished in\r\nthe 7th century, is the earliest elegist of whom we possess fragments. A\r\nlittle later Tyrtaeus was composing his famous elegies in Sparta. Both\r\nof these writers were, so far as we know, exclusively warlike and\r\npatriotic. On the other hand, the passion of love inspires Mimnermus,\r\nwhose elegies are the prototypes not only of the later Greek pieces, and\r\nof the Latin poems of the school of Tibullus and Propertius, but of a\r\ngreat deal of the formal erotic poetry of modern Europe. In the 6th\r\ncentury B.C., the elegies of Solon were admired; they are mainly lost.\r\nBut we possess more of the work of Theognis of Megara than of any other\r\narchaic elegist, and in it we can observe the characteristics of Greek\r\nelegy best. Here the Dorian spirit of chivalry reaches its highest\r\nexpression, and war is combined with manly love.\r\n\r\nThe elegy, in its calm movement, seems to have begun to lose currency\r\nwhen the ecstasy of emotion was more successfully interpreted by the\r\nvarious rhythmic and dithyrambic inventions of the Aeolic lyrists. The\r\nelegy, however, rose again to the highest level of merit in Alexandrian\r\ntimes. It was reintroduced by Philetas in the 3rd cent. B.C., and was\r\ncarried to extreme perfection by Callimachus. Other later Greek elegists\r\nof high reputation were Asclepiades and Euphorion. But it is curious to\r\nnotice that all the elegies of these poets were of an amatory nature,\r\nand that antiquity styled the funeral dirges of Theocritus, Bion and\r\nMoschus--which are to us the types of elegy--not elegies at all, but\r\nidylls. When the poets of Rome began their imitative study of\r\nAlexandrian models, it was natural that the elegies of writers such as\r\nCallimachus should tempt them to immediate imitation. Gallus, whose\r\nworks are unhappily lost, is known to have produced a great sensation in\r\nRome by publishing his translation of the poems of Euphorion; and he\r\npassed on to the composition of erotic elegies of his own, which were\r\nthe earliest in the Latin language. If we possessed his once-famous\r\n_Cytheris_, we should be able to decide the question of how much\r\nPropertius, who is now the leading figure among Roman elegists, owed to\r\nthe example of Gallus. His brilliantly emotional _Cynthia_, with its\r\nrich and unexampled employment of that alternation of hexameter and\r\npentameter which had now come to be known as the elegiac measure, seems,\r\nhowever, to have settled the type of Latin elegy. Tibullus is always\r\nnamed in conjunction with Propertius, who was his contemporary, although\r\nin their style they were violently contrasted. The sweetness of Tibullus\r\nwas the object of admiration and constant imitation by the Latin poets\r\nof the Renaissance, although Propertius has more austerely pleased a\r\nlater taste. Finally, Ovid wrote elegies of great variety in subject,\r\nbut all in the same form, and his dexterous easy metre closed the\r\ntradition of elegiac poetry among the ancients. What remains in the\r\ndecline of Latin literature is all founded on a study of those masters\r\nof the Golden Age.\r\n\r\nWhen the Renaissance found its way to England, the word \"elegy\" was\r\nintroduced by readers of Ovid and Propertius. But from the beginning of\r\nthe 16th century, it was used in English, as it has been ever since, to\r\ndescribe a funeral song or lament. One of the earliest poems in English\r\nwhich bears the title of elegy is _The Complaint of Philomene_, which\r\nGeorge Gascoigne began in 1562, and printed in 1576. The _Daphnaida_ of\r\nSpenser (1591) is an elegy in the strict modern sense, namely a poem of\r\nregret pronounced at the obsequies of a particular person. In 1579\r\nPuttenham had defined an elegy as being a song \"of long lamentation.\"\r\nWith the opening of the 17th century the composition of elegies became\r\nuniversal on every occasion of public or private grief. Dr Johnson's\r\ndefinition, \"_Elegy_, a short poem without points or turns,\" is\r\nsingularly inept and careless. By that time (1755) English literature\r\nhad produced many great elegies, of which the _Lycidas_ of Milton is by\r\nfar the most illustrious. But even Cowley's on Crashaw, Tickell's on\r\nAddison, Pope's on an Unfortunate Lady, those of Quarles, and Dryden,\r\nand Donne, should have warned Johnson of his mistake. Since the 18th\r\ncentury the most illustrious examples of elegy in English literature\r\nhave been the _Adonais_ of Shelley (on Keats), the _Thyrsis_ of Matthew\r\nArnold (on Clough), and the _Ave atque Vale_ of Mr Swinburne (on\r\nBaudelaire). It remains for us to mention what is the most celebrated\r\nelegy in English, that written by Gray in a Country Churchyard. This,\r\nhowever, belongs to a class apart, as it is not addressed to the memory\r\nof any particular person. A writer of small merit, James Hammond\r\n(1716-1742), enjoyed a certain success with his _Love Elegies_ in which\r\nhe endeavoured to introduce the erotic elegy as it was written by Ovid\r\nand Tibullus. This experiment took no hold of English literature, but\r\nwas welcomed in France in the amatory works of Parny (1753-1814), in\r\nthose of Chenedolle (1769-1833), and of Millevoye (1782-1816). The\r\nmelancholy and sentimental elegies of the last named are the typical\r\nexamples of this class of poetry in French literature. Lamartine must be\r\nincluded among the elegists, and his famous \"Le Lac\" is as eminent an\r\nelegy in French as Gray's \"Country Churchyard\" is in English. The elegy\r\nhas flourished in Portugal, partly because it was cultivated with great\r\nsuccess by Camoens, the most illustrious of the Portuguese poets. In\r\nItalian, Chiabrera and Filicaia are named among the leading national\r\nelegists. In German literature, the notion of elegy as a poem of\r\nlamentation does not exist. The famous Roman Elegies of Goethe imitate\r\nin form and theme those of Ovid; they are not even plaintive in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nELEGIAC VERSE has commonly been adopted by German poets for their\r\nelegies, but by English poets never. Schiller defines this kind of\r\nverse, which consists of a distich of which the first line is a\r\nhexameter and the second a pentameter, in the following pretty\r\nillustration:--\r\n\r\n  \"In the hexameter rises the fountain's silvery column.\r\n   In the pentameter aye falling in melody back.\"\r\n\r\nThe word \"elegy,\" in English, is one which is frequently used very\r\nincorrectly; it should be remembered that it must be mournful,\r\nmeditative and short without being ejaculatory. Thus Tennyson's _In\r\nMemoriam_ is excluded by its length; it may at best be treated as a\r\ncollection of elegies. Wordsworth's _Lucy_, on the other hand, is a\r\ndirge; this is too brief a burst of emotion to be styled an elegy.\r\n_Lycidas_ and _Adonais_ remain the two unapproachable types of what a\r\npersonal elegy ought to be in English.     (E. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEMENT (Lat. _elementum_), an ultimate component of anything, hence a\r\nfundamental principle. _Elementum_ was used in Latin to translate the\r\nGreek _[Greek: stoicheion]_ (that which stands in a _[Greek: stoichos]_,\r\nor row), and is a word of obscure origin and etymology. The root of Lat.\r\n_alere_, to nourish, has been suggested, thus making it a doublet of\r\n_alimentum_, that which supports life; another explanation is that the\r\nword represents LMN., the first three letters of the second part of the\r\nalphabet, a parallel use to that of ABC. Apart from its application in\r\nchemistry, which is treated below, the word is used of the rudiments or\r\n_principia_ of any science or subject, as in Euclid's _Elements of\r\nGeometry_, or in the \"beggarly elements\" (_[Greek: taptocha stoicheia]_,\r\nof St Paul in Gal. iv. 9); in mathematics, of a fundamental concept\r\ninvolved in an investigation, as the \"elements\" of a determinant; and in\r\nelectricity, of a galvanic (or voltaic) \"element\" in an electric cell\r\n(see BATTERY: _Electric_). In astronomy, \"element\" is used of any one of\r\nthe numerical or geometrical data by which the course of a varying\r\nphenomenon is computed; it is applied especially to orbital motion and\r\neclipses. The \"elements of an orbit\" are the six data by which the\r\nposition of a moving body in its orbit at any time may be determined.\r\nThe \"elements of an eclipse\" express and determine the motion of the\r\ncentre of the shadow-axis, and are the data necessary to compute the\r\nphenomena of an eclipse during its whole course, as seen at any place.\r\nIn architecture the term \"element\" is applied to the outline of the\r\ndesign of a Decorated window, on which the centres for the tracery are\r\nfound. These centres will all be found to fall on points which, in some\r\nway or other, will be equimultiples of parts of the openings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Elements_.\r\n\r\n  Ancient ideas.\r\n\r\nLike all other scientific concepts, that of an element has changed its\r\nmeaning many times in many ways during the development of science. Owing\r\nto their very small amount of real chemical knowledge, the\r\ngeneralizations of the ancients were necessarily rather superficial, and\r\ncould not stand in the face of the increasing development of practical\r\nchemistry. Nevertheless we find the concept of an element as \"a\r\nsubstance from which all bodies are made or derived\" held at the very\r\nbeginning of occidental philosophy. Thales regarded \"water\" as the\r\nelement of all things; his followers accepted his idea of a primordial\r\nsubstance as the basis of all bodies, but they endeavoured to determine\r\nsome other general element or elements, like \"fire\" or \"spirit,\" or\r\n\"love\" and \"hatred,\" or \"fire,\" \"water,\" \"air\" and \"earth.\" We find in\r\nthis development an exact parallelism to the manner in which scientific\r\nideas generally arise, develop and change. They are created to point out\r\nthe common part in a variety of observed phenomena, in order to get some\r\nleading light in the chaos of events. At first almost any idea will do,\r\nif only it promises some comprehensive arrangement of the facts;\r\nafterwards, the inconsistencies of the first trial make themselves felt;\r\nthe first idea is then changed to meet better the new requirements. For\r\na shorter or longer time the facts and ideas may remain in accord, but\r\nthe uninterrupted increase of empirical knowledge involves sooner or\r\nlater new fundamental alterations of the general idea, and in this way\r\nthere is a never-ceasing process of adaptation of the ideas to the\r\nfacts. As facts are unchangeable by themselves, the adaptation can be\r\nonly one-sided; the ideas are compelled to change according to the\r\nfacts. We must therefore educate ourselves to regard the ideas or\r\ntheories as the changing part of science, and keep ourselves ready to\r\naccept even the most fundamental revision of current theories.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the development of the idea of elements was to\r\nrecognize that a _single_ principle would not prove sufficient to cover\r\nthe manifoldness of facts. Empedocles therefore conceived a double or\r\nbinary elementary principle; and Aristotle developed this idea a stage\r\nfurther, stating two sets of binary antagonistic principles, namely\r\n\"dry-wet\" and \"hot-cold.\" The Aristotelian or peripatetic elements,\r\nwhich played such a great role in the whole medieval philosophy, are the\r\nrepresentatives of the several binary combinations of these fundamental\r\nproperties, \"fire\" being hot and dry, \"air\" hot and wet, \"water\" cold\r\nand wet, \"earth\" cold and dry. According to the amount of these\r\nproperties found in any body, these elements were regarded as having\r\ntaken part in forming this body. Concerning the reason why only these\r\nproperties were regarded as fundamental, we know nothing. They seem to\r\nbe taken at random rather than carefully selected; they relate only to\r\nthe sense of touch, and not to vision or any other sense, possibly\r\nbecause deceptions in the sense of touch were regarded as non-existent,\r\nwhile the other senses were apparently not so trustworthy. At any rate,\r\nthe Aristotelian elements soon proved to be rather inadequate to meet\r\nthe requirements of the increasing chemical knowledge; other properties\r\nhad therefore to be selected to represent the general behaviour of\r\nchemical substances, and in this case we find them already much more\r\n\"chemical\" in the modern sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Elements of the alchemists.\r\n\r\nAmong the various substances recognized by the chemists, certain classes\r\nor groups readily distinguished themselves. First the metals, by their\r\nlustre, their heaviness, and a number of other common properties.\r\nAccording to the general principle of selecting a single substance as a\r\nrepresentative of the group, the metallic properties were represented by\r\n\"mercury.\" The theoreticians of the middle ages were rather careful to\r\npoint out that common mercury (the liquid metal of to-day) was not at\r\nall to be identified with \"philosophical\" mercury, the last being simply\r\nthe _principle_ of metallic behaviour. In the same way combustibility\r\nwas represented by \"sulphur,\" solubility by \"salt,\" and occasionally the\r\nchemically indifferent or refractory character by \"earth.\" According to\r\nthe subsistence and preponderance of these properties in different\r\nbodies, these were regarded as containing the corresponding elements;\r\nconversely, just as experience teaches the chemist every day that by\r\nproper treatment the properties of given bodies may be changed in the\r\nmost various ways, the observed changes of properties were ascribed to\r\nthe gain or loss of the corresponding elements. According to this\r\ntheory, which accounted rather well for a large number of facts, there\r\nwas no fundamental objection against trying to endow base metals with\r\nthe properties of the precious ones; to make artificial gold was a task\r\nquite similar to the modern problem of, e.g. making artificial quinine.\r\nThe realization that there is a certain natural law preventing such\r\nchanges is of much later date. It is therefore quite unjust to consider\r\nthe work of the alchemists, who tried to make artificial gold, as\r\nconsummate nonsense. _A priori_ there was no reason why a change from\r\nlead to gold should be less possible than a change from iron to rust;\r\nindeed there is no _a priori_ reason against it now. But experience has\r\ntaught us that lead and gold are chemical elements in the modern sense,\r\nand that there is a general experimental law that elements are not\r\ntransformable one into another. So experience taught the alchemists\r\nirresistibly that in spite of the manifoldness of chemical changes it is\r\nnot always possible to change any given substance into another; the\r\npossibilities are much more limited, and there is only a certain range\r\nof substances to be obtained from a given one. The impossibility of\r\ntransforming lead or copper into noble metals proved to be only one case\r\nout of many, and it was recognized generally that there are certain\r\nchemical families whose members are related to one another by their\r\nmutual transformability, while it is impossible to bridge the boundaries\r\nseparating these families.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Work of Robert Boyle.\r\n\r\nThe man who brought all these experiences and considerations into\r\nscientific form was Robert Boyle. He stated as a general principle, that\r\nonly tangible and ponderable substances should be recognized as\r\nelements, an element being a substance from which other substances may\r\nbe made, but which cannot be separated into different substances. He\r\nshowed that neither the peripatetic nor the alchemistic elements\r\nsatisfied this definition. But he was more of a critical than of a\r\nsynthetical turn of mind; although he established the correct\r\nprinciples, he hesitated to point out what substances, among those known\r\nat his time, were to be considered as elements. He only paved the way to\r\nthe goal by laying the foundations of analytical chemistry, i.e. by\r\nteaching how to characterize and to distinguish different chemical\r\nindividuals. Further, by adopting and developing the corpuscular\r\nhypothesis of the constitution of the ponderable substances, he\r\nforeshadowed, in a way, the law of the conservation of the elements,\r\nviz. that no element can be changed into another element; and he\r\nconsidered the compound substances to be made up from small particles or\r\ncorpuscles of their elements, the latter retaining their essence in all\r\ncombinations. This hypothesis accounts for the fact that only a limited\r\nnumber of other substances can be made from a given one--namely, only\r\nthose which contain the elements present in the given substance. But it\r\nis characteristic of Boyle's critical mind that he did not shut his eyes\r\nagainst a serious objection to his hypothesis. If the compound substance\r\nis made up of parts of the elements, one would expect that the\r\nproperties of the compound substance would prove to be the sum of the\r\nproperties of the elements. But this is not the case, and chemical\r\ncompounds show properties which generally differ very considerably from\r\nthose of the compounds. On the one hand, the corpuscular hypothesis of\r\nBoyle was developed into the atomic hypothesis of Dalton, which was\r\nconsidered at the beginning of the 19th century as the very best\r\nrepresentation of chemical facts, while, on the other hand, the\r\ndifficulty as to the properties of the compounds remained the same as\r\nBoyle found it, and has not yet been removed by an appropriate\r\ndevelopment of the atomic hypothesis. Thus Boyle considered, e.g. the\r\nmetals as elements. However, it is interesting to note that he\r\nconsidered the mutual transformation of the metals as not altogether\r\nimpossible, and he even tells of a case when gold was transformed into\r\nbase metal. It is a common psychological fact that a reformer does not\r\ngenerally succeed in being wholly consistent in his reforming ideas;\r\nthere remains invariably some point where he commits exactly the same\r\nfault which he set out to abolish. We shall find the same inconsistency\r\nalso among other chemical reformers. Even earlier than Boyle, Joachim\r\nJung (1587-1657) of Hamburg developed similar ideas. But as he did not\r\ndistinguish himself, as Boyle did, by experimental work in science, his\r\nviews exerted only a limited influence amongst his pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Phlogiston theory.\r\n\r\nIn the times following Boyle's work we find no remarkable outside\r\ndevelopment of the theory of elements, but a very important inside one.\r\nAnalytical chemistry, or the art of distinguishing different chemical\r\nsubstances, was rapidly developing, and the necessary foundation for\r\nsuch a theory was thus laid. We find the discussions about the true\r\nelements disappearing from the text-books, or removed to an\r\ninsignificant corner, while the description of observed chemical changes\r\nof different ways of preparing the same substance, as identified by the\r\nsame properties, and of the methods for recognizing and distinguishing\r\nthe various substances, take their place. The similarity of certain\r\ngroups of chemical changes, as, for example, combustion, and the inverse\r\nprocess, reduction, was observed, and thus led to an attempt to shape\r\nthese most general facts into a common theory. In this way the theory of\r\n\"phlogiston\" was developed by G.E. Stahl, phlogiston being (according to\r\nthe usual way of regarding general properties as being due to a\r\nprinciple or element) the \"principle of combustibility,\" similar to the\r\n\"sulphur\" of the alchemists. This again must be regarded as quite a\r\nlegitimate step justified by the knowledge of the time. For experience\r\ntaught that combustibility could be _transferred_ by chemical action,\r\ne.g. from charcoal to litharge, the latter being changed thereby into\r\ncombustible metallic lead; and according to Boyle's principle, that only\r\n_bodies_ should be recognized as chemical elements, phlogiston was\r\nconsidered as a body. From the fact that all leading chemists in the\r\nsecond half of the 18th century used the phlogiston theory and were not\r\nhindered by it in making their great discoveries, it is evident that a\r\nsufficient amount of truth and usefulness was embodied in this theory.\r\nIt states indeed quite correctly the mutual relations between oxidation\r\nand reduction, as we now call these very general processes, and was\r\nerroneous only in regard to one question, which at that time had not\r\naroused much interest, the question of the change of weight during\r\nchemical processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lavoisier's reform.\r\n\r\nIt was only after Isaac Newton's discovery of universal gravitation that\r\nweight was considered as a property of paramount interest and\r\nimportance, and that the question of the changes of weight in chemical\r\nreactions became one worth asking. When in due time this question was\r\nraised, the fact became evident at once, that combustion means not loss\r\nbut gain of weight. To be sure of this, it was necessary to know first\r\nthe chemical and physical properties of gases, and it was just at the\r\nsame time that this knowledge was developed by Priestley, Scheele and\r\nothers. Lavoisier was the originator and expounder of the necessary\r\nreform. Oxygen was just discovered at that time, and Lavoisier gathered\r\nevidence from all sides that the theory of phlogiston had to be turned\r\ninside out to fit the new facts.\r\n\r\nHe realized that the sum total of the weights of all substances\r\nconcerned within a chemical change is not altered by the change. This\r\nprinciple of the \"conservation of weight\" led at once to a simple and\r\nunmistakable definition of a chemical element. As the weight of a\r\ncompound substance is the sum of the weights of its elements, the\r\ncompound necessarily weighs more than any of its elements. An element is\r\ntherefore a substance which, by being changed into another substance,\r\ninvariably increases its weight, and never gives rise to substances of\r\nless weight. By the help of this criterion Lavoisier composed the first\r\ntable of chemical elements similar to our modern ones. According to the\r\nknowledge of his time he regarded the alkalis as elements, although he\r\nremarked that they are rather similar to certain oxides, and therefore\r\nmay possibly contain oxygen; the truth of this was proved at a later\r\ndate by Humphry Davy. But the inconsistency of the reformer, already\r\nreferred to, may be observed with Lavoisier. He included \"heat and\r\nlight\" in his list of elements, although he knew that neither of them\r\nhad weight, and that neither fitted his definition of an element; this\r\natavistic survival was subsequently removed from the table of the\r\nelements by Berzelius in the beginning of the 19th century. In this way\r\nthe question of what substances are to be regarded as chemical elements\r\nhad been settled satisfactorily in a qualitative way, but it is\r\ninteresting to realize that the last step in this development, the\r\ntheory of Lavoisier, was based on quantitative considerations. Such\r\nconsiderations became of paramount interest at once, and led to the\r\nconcept of the _combining weights of the elements_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  J.B. Richter's work.\r\n\r\nThe first discoveries in this field were made in the last quarter of the\r\n18th century by J.B. Richter. The point at issue was a rather\r\ncommonplace one: it was the fact that when two neutral salt solutions\r\nwere mixed to undergo mutual chemical decomposition and recombination,\r\nthe resulting liquid was neutral again, i.e. it did not contain any\r\nexcess of acid or base. In other words, if two salts, A'B' and A\" B\",\r\ncomposed of the acids A' and A\" and the bases B' and B\", undergo mutual\r\ndecomposition, the amount of the base B' left by the first salt, when\r\nits acid A' united with the base B\" to form a new salt A'B\", was just\r\nenough to make a neutral salt A\"B' with the acid A\" left by the second\r\nsalt. At first sight this looks quite simple and self-evident,--that\r\nneutral salts should form neutral ones again and not acid or basic\r\nones,--but if this fact is once stated very serious quantitative\r\ninferences may be drawn from it, as Richter showed. For if the symbols\r\nA', A\", B', B\" denote at the same time such quantities of the acids and\r\nbases as form neutral salts, then if three of these quantities are\r\ndetermined, the fourth may be calculated from the others. This follows\r\nfrom the fact that by decomposing A'B' with just the proper amount of\r\nthe other salt to form A'B\", the remaining quantities B' and A\" exist in\r\nexactly the ratio to form a neutral salt A\" B'. It is possible,\r\ntherefore, to ascribe to each acid and base a certain relative weight or\r\n\"combining weight\" by which they will combine one with the other to form\r\nneutral salts. The same reasoning may be extended to any number of acids\r\nand bases.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Richter did not find out by himself this simplest\r\nstatement of the law of neutrality which he discovered, but he expressed\r\nthe same consequence in a rather clumsy way by a table of the combining\r\nweights of different bases related to the unit amount of a certain acid,\r\nand doing the same thing for the unit weight of every other acid. Then\r\nhe observed that the numbers in these different tables are proportionate\r\none to another. The same holds good if the corresponding series of the\r\ncombining weights of acids for unit weights of different bases were\r\ntabulated. It was only a little later that a Berlin physicist, G.E.\r\nFischer, united the whole system of Richter's numbers simply into a\r\ndouble table of acids and bases, taking as unit an arbitrarily chosen\r\nsubstance, namely sulphuric acid. The following table by Fischer is\r\ntherefore the first table of combining weights.\r\n\r\n        _Bases._                 _Acids._\r\n  Alumina         525 | Fluoric                 427\r\n  Magnesia        615 | Carbonic                577\r\n  Ammoniac        672 | Sebacic                 706\r\n  Lime            793 | Muriatic (hydrochloric) 712\r\n  Soda            859 | Oxalic                  755\r\n  Strontiane     1329 | Phosphoric              979\r\n  Potash         1605 | Formic                  988\r\n  Baryte         2222 | Sulphuric              1000\r\n                      | Succinic               1209\r\n                      | Nitric                 1405\r\n                      | Acetic                 1480\r\n                      | Citric                 1683\r\n                      | Tartaric               1694\r\n\r\nIt is interesting again to notice how difficult it is for the discoverer\r\nof a new truth to find out the most simple and complete statement of his\r\ndiscovery. It looks as if the amount of work needed to get to the top of\r\na new idea is so great that not enough energy remains to clear the very\r\nlast few steps. It is noteworthy also to observe how difficult it was\r\nfor the chemists of that time to understand the bearing of Richter's\r\nwork. Although a summary of his results was published in Berthollet's\r\n_Essai de statique chimique_, one of the most renowned chemical books of\r\nthat time, nobody dared for a long time to take up the scientific\r\ntreasure laid open for all the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n  John Dalton's atomic theory.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 19th century the same question was taken up from\r\nquite another standpoint. John Dalton, in his investigations of the\r\nbehaviour of gases, and in order to understand more easily what happened\r\nwhen gases were absorbed by liquids, used the corpuscular hypothesis\r\nalready mentioned in connexion with Boyle. While he depicted to himself\r\nhow the corpuscles, or, as he preferred to call them, the \"atoms\" of\r\nthe gases, entered the interstices of the atoms of the liquids in which\r\nthey dissolved, he asked himself: Are the several atoms of the same\r\nsubstance exactly alike, or are there differences as between the grains\r\nof sand? Now experience teaches us that it is impossible to separate,\r\nfor example, a quantity of pure water into two samples of somewhat\r\ndifferent properties. When a pure substance is fractionated by partial\r\ndistillation or partial crystallization or partial change into another\r\nsubstance by chemical means, we find constantly that the residue is not\r\nchanged in its properties, as it would be if the atoms were slightly\r\ndifferent, since in that case e.g. the lighter atoms would distil first\r\nand leave behind the heavier ones, &c. Therefore we must conclude that\r\nall atoms of the same kind are exactly alike in shape and weight. But,\r\nif this be so, then all combinations between different atoms must\r\nproceed in certain invariable ratios of the weights of the elements,\r\nnamely by the ratio of the weights of the atoms. Now it is impossible to\r\nweigh the atoms directly; but if we determine the ratio of the weights\r\nin which oxygen and hydrogen combine to form water, we determine in this\r\nway also the relative weight of their atoms. By a proper number of\r\nanalyses of simple chemical compounds we may determine the ratios\r\nbetween the weights of all elementary atoms, and, selecting one of them\r\nas a standard or unit, we may express the weight of all other atoms in\r\nterms of this unit. The following table is Dalton's (_Mem. of the Lit.\r\nand Phil. Soc. of Manchester_ (II.), vol. i. p. 287, 1805).\r\n\r\n  _Table of the Relative Weights of the Ultimate Particles of Gaseous\r\n  and other Bodies._\r\n\r\n  Hydrogen                 1   | Nitrous oxide             13.7\r\n  Azot                     4.2 | Sulphur                   14.4\r\n  Carbone                  4.3 | Nitric acid               15.2\r\n  Ammonia                  5.2 | Sulphuretted hydrogen     15.4\r\n  Oxygen                   5.5 | Carbonic acid             15.3\r\n  Water                    6.5 | Alcohol                   15.1\r\n  Phosphorus               7.2 | Sulphureous acid          19.9\r\n  Phosphuretted hydrogen   8.2 | Sulphuric acid            25.4\r\n  Nitrous gas              9.3 | Carburetted hydrogen from\r\n  Ether                    9.6 |   stagnant water           6.3\r\n  Gaseous oxide of carbone 9.8 | Olefiant gas               5.3\r\n\r\nDalton at once drew a peculiar inference from this view. If two elements\r\ncombine in different ratios, one must conclude that different numbers of\r\natoms unite. There must be, therefore, a simple ratio between the\r\nquantities of the one element united to the same quantity of the other.\r\nDalton showed at once that the analysis of carbon monoxide and of\r\ncarbonic acid satisfied this consequence, the quantity of oxygen in the\r\nsecond compound being double the quantity in the first one. A similar\r\nrelation holds good between marsh gas and olefiant gas (ethylene). This\r\nis the \"law of multiple proportions\" (see ATOM). By these considerations\r\nDalton extended the law of combining weights, which Richter had\r\ndemonstrated only for neutral salts, to all possible chemical compounds.\r\nWhile the scope of the law was enormously extended, its experimental\r\nfoundation was even smaller than with Richter. Dalton did not concern\r\nhimself very much with the experimental verification of his ideas, and\r\nthe first communication of his theory in a paper on the absorption of\r\ngases by liquids (1803) attracted as little notice as Richter's\r\ndiscoveries. Even when T. Thomson published Dalton's views in an\r\nappendix to his widely read text-book of chemistry, matters did not\r\nchange very much. It was only by the work of J.J. Berzelius that the\r\nenormous importance of Dalton's views was brought to light.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Work of J.J. Berzelius.\r\n\r\nBerzelius was at that time busy in developing a trustworthy system of\r\nchemical analysis, and for this purpose he investigated the composition\r\nof the most important salts. He then went over the work of Richter, and\r\nrealized that by his law he could check the results of his analyses. He\r\ntried it and found the law to hold good in most cases; when it did not,\r\naccording to his analyses, he found that the error was on his own side\r\nand that better analyses fitted Richter's law. Thus he was prepared to\r\nunderstand the importance of Dalton's views and he proceeded at once to\r\ntest its exactness. The result was the best possible. The law of the\r\ncombining weights of the atoms, or of the atomic weights, proved to\r\nhold good in every case in which it was tested. All chemical\r\ncombinations between the several elements are therefore regulated by\r\nweight according to certain numbers, one for each element, and\r\ncombinations between the elements occur only in ratios given by these\r\nweights or by simple multiples thereof. Consequently Berzelius regarded\r\nDalton's atomic hypothesis as proved by experiment, and became a strong\r\nbeliever in it.\r\n\r\nAt the same time W.H. Wollaston had discovered independently the law of\r\nmultiple proportions in the case of neutral and acid salts. He gave up\r\nfurther work when he learned of Dalton's ideas, but afterwards he\r\npointed out that it was necessary to distinguish the _hypothetical_ part\r\nin Dalton's views from their _empirical_ part. The latter is the law of\r\ncombining weights, or the law that chemical combination occurs only\r\naccording to certain numbers characteristic for each element. Besides\r\nthis purely experimental law there is the hypothetical explanation by\r\nthe assumption of the existence of atoms. As it is not proved that this\r\nexplanation is the only one possible, the existence of the law is not a\r\nproof of the existence of the atoms. He therefore preferred to call the\r\ncharacteristic combining numbers of the elements not \"atomic weights\"\r\nbut \"chemical equivalents.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough there were at all times chemists who shared Wollaston's\r\ncautious views, the atomic hypothesis found general acceptance because\r\nof its ready adaptability to the most diverse chemical facts. In our\r\ntime it is even rather difficult to separate, as Wollaston did, the\r\nempirical part from the hypothetical one, and the concept of the atom\r\npenetrates the whole system of chemistry, especially organic chemistry.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the work of Dalton with that of Richter we find a\r\nfundamental difference. Richter's inference as to the existence of\r\ncombining weights in salts is based solely on an experimental\r\nobservation, namely, the persistence of neutrality after double\r\ndecomposition; Dalton's theory, on the contrary, is based on the\r\nhypothetical concept of the atom. Now, however favourably one may think\r\nof the probability of the existence of atoms, this existence is really\r\nnot an observed fact, and it is necessary therefore to ask: Does there\r\nexist some general fact which may lead directly to the inference of the\r\nexistence of combining weights of the elements, just as the persistence\r\nof neutrality leads to the same consequence as to acids and bases? The\r\nanswer is in the affirmative, although it took a whole century before\r\nthis question was put and answered. In a series of rather difficult\r\npapers (_Zeits. f. Phys. Chem._ since 1895, and _Annalen der\r\nNaturphilosophie_ since 1902), Franz Wald (of Kladno, Bohemia) developed\r\nhis investigations as to the genesis of this general law. Later, W.\r\nOstwald (Faraday lecture, _Trans. Chem. Soc._, 1904) simplified Wald's\r\nreasoning and made it more evident.\r\n\r\nThe general fact upon which the necessary existence of combining weights\r\nof the elements may be based is the shifting character of the boundary\r\nbetween elements and compounds. It has already been pointed out that\r\nLavoisier considered the alkalis and the alkaline earths as elements,\r\nbecause in his time they had not been decomposed. As long as the\r\ndecomposition had not been effected, these compounds could be considered\r\nand treated like elements without mistake, their combining weight being\r\nthe sum of the combining weights of their (subsequently discovered)\r\nelements. This means that compounds enter in reaction with other\r\nsubstances as a whole, just as elements do. In particular, if a compound\r\nAB combines with another substance (elementary or compound) C to form a\r\nternary compound ABC, it enters this latter as a whole, leaving behind\r\nno residue of A or B. Inversely, if a ternary compound ABC be changed\r\ninto a binary one AB by taking away the element C, there will not be\r\nfound any excess of A or B, but both elements will exhibit just the same\r\nratio in the binary as in the ternary compound.\r\n\r\nExperimentally this important fact was proved first by Berzelius, who\r\nshowed that by oxidizing lead sulphide, PbS, to lead sulphate, PbSO4, no\r\nexcess either of sulphur or lead could be found after oxidation; the\r\nsame held good with barium sulphite, BaSO3, when converted into barium\r\nsulphate, BaSO4. On a much larger scale and with very great accuracy\r\nthe inverse was proved half a century later by J.S. Stas, who reduced\r\nsilver chlorate, AgClO3, silver bromate, AgBrO3, and silver iodate,\r\nAgIO3, to the corresponding binary compounds, AgCl, AgBr and AgI, and\r\nsearched in the residue of the reaction for any excess of silver or\r\nhalogen. As the tests for these substances are among the most sensitive\r\nin analytical chemistry, the general law underwent a very severe test\r\nindeed. But the result was the same as was found by Berzelius--no excess\r\nof one of the elements could be discovered. We may infer, therefore,\r\ngenerally that compounds enter ulterior combinations without change of\r\nthe ratio of their elements, or that the ratio between different\r\nelements in their compounds is the same in binary and ternary (or still\r\nmore complicated) combinations.\r\n\r\nThis law involves the existence of general combining weights just in the\r\nsame way as the law of neutrality with double decomposition of salts\r\ninvolves the law of the combining weights of acids and bases. For if the\r\nratio between A and B is determined, this same ratio must obtain in all\r\nternary and more complicated compounds, containing the same elements.\r\nThe same is true for any other elements, C, D, E, F, &c., as related to\r\nA. But by applying the general law to the ternary compound ABC the same\r\nconclusion may be drawn as to the ratio A : C in all compounds\r\ncontaining A and C, or B : C in the corresponding compounds. By\r\nreasoning further in the same way, we come to the conclusion that only\r\nsuch compounds are possible which contain elements according to certain\r\nratio-numbers, i.e. their combining weight. Any other ratio would\r\nviolate the law of the integral reaction of compounds.\r\n\r\nAs to the law of multiple proportions, it may be deduced by a similar\r\nreasoning by considering the possible combinations between a compound,\r\ne.g. AB, and one of its elements, say B. AB and B can combine only\r\naccording to their combining weights, and therefore the quantity of B\r\ncombining with AB is equal to the quantity of AB which has combined with\r\nA to form AB. The new combination is therefore to be expressed by AB2.\r\nBy extending this reasoning in the same way, we get the general\r\nconclusion that any compounds must be composed according to the formula\r\nA_m B_n C_p..., where m, n, p, &c., are integers.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of these considerations on the atomic hypothesis is not to\r\ndisprove it, but rather to show that the existence of the law of\r\ncombining weights, which has been considered for so long as a proof of\r\nthe truth of this hypothesis, does not necessarily involve such a\r\nconsequence. Whether atoms may prove to exist or not, the law of\r\ncombining weights is independent thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Atomic weight determinations.\r\n\r\nTwo problems arose from the discoveries of Dalton and Berzelius. The\r\nfirst was to determine as exactly as possible the correct numbers of the\r\ncombining weights. The other results from the fact that the same\r\nelements may combine in different ratios. Which of these ratios gives\r\nthe true ratio of the atomic weights? And which is the multiple one?\r\nBoth questions have had most ample experimental investigation, and are\r\nnow answered rather satisfactorily. The first question was a purely\r\ntechnical one; its answer depended upon analytical skill, and Berzelius\r\nin his time easily took the lead, his numbers being readily accepted on\r\nthe continent of Europe. In England there was a certain hesitation at\r\nfirst, owing to Prout's assumption (see below), but when Turner, at the\r\ninstigation of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,\r\ntested Berzelius's numbers and found them entirely in accordance with\r\nhis own measurements, these numbers were universally accepted. But then\r\na rather large error in one of Berzelius's numbers (for carbon) was\r\ndiscovered in 1841 by Dumas and Stas, and a kind of panic ensued. New\r\ndeterminations of the atomic weights were undertaken from all sides. The\r\nresult was most satisfactory for Berzelius, for no other important error\r\nwas discovered, and even Dumas remarked that repeating a determination\r\nby Berzelius only meant getting the same result, if one worked properly.\r\nIn later times more exact measurements, corresponding to the increasing\r\nart in analysis, were carried out by various workers, amongst whom J.S.\r\nStas distinguished himself. But even the classical work of Stas proved\r\nnot to be entirely without error; for every period has its limit in\r\naccuracy, which extends slowly as science extends. In recent times\r\nAmerican chemists have been especially prominent in work of this kind,\r\nand the determinations of E.W. Morley, T.W. Richards and G.P. Baxter\r\nrank among the first in this line of investigation.\r\n\r\nDuring this work the question arose naturally: How far does the\r\n_exactness_ of the law extend? It is well known that most natural laws\r\nare only approximations, owing to disturbing causes. Are there\r\ndisturbing causes also with atomic weights? The answer is that as far as\r\nwe know there are none. The law is still an exact one. But we must keep\r\nin mind that an absolute answer is never possible. Our exactness is in\r\nevery case limited, and as long as the possible variations lie behind\r\nthis limit, we cannot tell anything about them. In recent times H.\r\nLandolt has doubted and experimentally investigated the law of the\r\nconservation of weight.\r\n\r\nLandolt's experiments were carried out in vessels of the shape of an\r\ninverted U, each branch holding one of the substances to react one on\r\nthe other. Two vessels were prepared as equal as possible and hung on\r\nboth sides of a most sensitive balance. Then the difference of weight\r\nwas determined in the usual way by exchanging both the vessels on the\r\nbalance. After this set of weighings one of the vessels was inverted and\r\nthe chemical reaction between the contained substances was performed;\r\nthen the double weighing was repeated. Finally also the second vessel\r\nwas inverted and a third set of weighings taken. From blank experiments\r\nwhere the vessels were filled with substances which did not react one on\r\nthe other, the maximum error was determined to 0.03 milligramme. The\r\nreactions experimented with were: silver salts with ferrous sulphate;\r\niron on copper sulphate; gold chloride and ferrous chloride; iodic acid\r\nand hydriodic acid; iodine and sodium sulphite; uranyl nitrate and\r\npotassium hydrate; chloral hydrate and potassium hydrate; electrolysis\r\nof cadmium iodide by an alternating current; solution of ammonium\r\nchloride, potassium bromide and uranyl nitrate in water, and\r\nprecipitation of an aqueous solution of copper sulphate by alcohol. In\r\nmost of these experiments a slight diminution of weight was observed\r\nwhich exceeded the limit of error distinctly in two cases, viz. silver\r\nnitrate with ferrous sulphate and iodic acid with hydriodic acid, the\r\nloss of weight amounting from 0.068 to 0.199 mg. with the first and\r\n0.047 to 0.177 mg. with the second reaction on about 50 g. of substance.\r\nAs each of these reactions had been tried in nine independent\r\nexperiments, Landolt felt certain that there was no error of observation\r\ninvolved. But when the vessels were covered inside with paraffin wax, no\r\nappreciable diminution of weight was observed.\r\n\r\nThese experiments apparently suggested a small decrease of weight as a\r\nconsequence of chemical processes. On repeating them, however, and\r\nmaking allowance for the different amounts of water absorbed on the\r\nsurface of the vessel at the beginning and end of the experiment,\r\nLandolt found in 1908 (_Zeit. physik. Chem._ 64, p. 581) that the\r\nvariations in weight are equally positive and negative, and he concluded\r\nthat there was no change in weight, at least to the extent of 1 part in\r\n10,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The periodic arrangement.\r\n\r\nThere is still another question regarding the numerical values of the\r\natomic weights, namely: Are there relations between the numbers\r\nbelonging to the several elements? Richter had arranged his combining\r\nweights according to their magnitude, and endeavoured to prove that they\r\nform a certain mathematical series. He also explained the incompleteness\r\nof his series by assuming that certain acids or bases requisite to the\r\nfilling up of the gaps in the series, were not yet known. He even had\r\nthe satisfaction that in his time a new base was discovered, which\r\nfitted rather well into one of his gaps; but when it turned out\r\nafterwards that this new base was only calcium phosphate, this way of\r\nreasoning fell into discredit and was resumed only at a much later date.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a correct table of atomic weights the second question already\r\nmentioned, viz. how to select the correct value in the case of multiple\r\nproportions, had to be answered. Berzelius was constantly on the\r\nlook-out for means to distinguish the true atomic weights from their\r\nmultiples or sub-multiples, but he could not find an unmistakable test.\r\nThe whole question fell into a terrible disorder, until in the middle of\r\nthe 19th century S. Cannizzaro showed that by taking together all\r\npartial evidences one could get a system of atomic weights consistent in\r\nitself and fitting the exigencies of chemical systematics. Then a\r\nstartling discovery was made by the same method which Richter had tried\r\nin vain, by arranging all atomic weights in one series according to\r\ntheir numerical values.\r\n\r\n_The Periodic Law._--The history of this discovery is rather long. As\r\nearly as 1817 J.W. Dobereiner of Jena drew attention to the fact that\r\nthe combining weight of strontium lies midway between those of calcium\r\nand barium, and some years later he showed that such \"triads\" occurred\r\nin other cases too. L. Gmelin tried to apply this idea to all elements,\r\nbut he realized that in many cases more than three elements had to be\r\ngrouped together. While Ernst Lenssen applied the idea of triads to the\r\nwhole table of chemical elements, but without any important result, the\r\nother idea of grouping more than three elements into series according to\r\ntheir combining weights proved more successful. It was the concept of\r\nhomologous series just developed in organic chemistry which influenced\r\nsuch considerations. First Max von Pettenkofer in 1850 and then J.B.A.\r\nDumas in 1851 undertook to show that such a series of similar elements\r\ncould be formed, having nearly constant differences between their\r\ncombining weights. It is true that this idea in all its simplicity did\r\nnot hold good extensively enough; so J.P. Cooke and Dumas tried more\r\ncomplicated types of numerical series, but only with a temporary\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe idea of arranging all elements in a single series in the order of\r\nthe magnitude of their combining weights, the germ of which is to be\r\nfound already in J.B. Richter's work, appears first in 1860 in some\r\ntables published by Lothar Meyer for his lectures. Independently, A.E.B.\r\nde Chancourtois in 1862, J.A.R. Newlands in 1863, and D.I. Mendeleeff in\r\n1869, developed the same idea with the same result, namely, that it is\r\npossible to divide this series of all the elements into a certain number\r\nof very similar parts. In their papers, which appeared in the same year,\r\n1869, Lothar Meyer and Mendeleeff gave to all these trials the shape now\r\ngenerally adopted. They succeeded in proving beyond all doubt that this\r\nseries was of a _periodic character_, and could be cut into shorter\r\npieces of similar construction. Here again gaps were present to be\r\nfilled up by elements to be discovered, and Mendeleeff, who did this,\r\npredicted from the general regularity of his table the properties of\r\nsuch unknown elements. In this case fate was more kind than with\r\nRichter, and science had the satisfaction of seeing these predictions\r\nturn out to be true.\r\n\r\nThe following table contains this periodic arrangement of the elements\r\naccording to their atomic weight. By cutting the whole series into\r\npieces of eight elements (or more in several cases) and arranging these\r\none below another in the alternating way shown in the table, one finds\r\nsimilar elements placed in vertical series whose properties change\r\ngradually and with some regularity according to their place in the\r\ntable. Not only the properties of the uncombined elements obey this\r\nrule, but also almost all properties of similar compounds of the\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n  +--------+-----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------------------------+\r\n  |He 4.0  |Li 7.03    |Be 9.1    |B 11.0    |C 12.00   |N 14.01   |O 16.00   |F 19.0    |   ..       ..       ..     |\r\n  |  Ne 20 |  Na 23.00 |  Mg 24.32|  Al 27.1 |  Si 28.4 |  P 31.0  |  S 32.06 |  Cl 35.45|   ..       ..       ..     |\r\n  |Ar 39.9 |K 39.15    |Ca 40.1   |Sc 44.1   |Ti 48.1   |V 51.2    |Cr 52.0   |Mn 55.0   |Fe 55.9, Ni 58.7, Co 59.0   |\r\n  |   ..   |  Cu 63.6  |  In 65.4 |  Ga 70   |  Ge 72.5 |  As 75.0 |  Se 79.2 |  Br 79.96|   ..       ..       ..     |\r\n  |Kr 83.0 |Rb 85.5    |Sr 87.6   |Y 89.0    |Zr 90.6   |Cb(Nb) 94 |Mo 96.0   |    ..    |Ru 101.7, Rh 103.0, Pd 106.5|\r\n  |   ..   |  Ag 107.93|  Cd 112.4|  In 115  |  Sn 119.0|  Sb 120.2|  Te 127.6|  I 126.97|   ..       ..       ..     |\r\n  |Xe 130.7|Cs 132.9   |Ba 137.4  |La 138.9  |Ce &c. 140|Ta 181    |W 184     |    ..    |Os 191, Ir 193.0, Pt 194.8  |\r\n  |   ..   |  Au 197.2 |  Hg 200.0|  Tl 204.1|  Pb 206.9|  Bi 208.0|    ..    |    ..    |   ..       ..       ..     |\r\n  |   ..   |     ..    |Ra 225    |    ..    |Th 232.5  |    ..    |U 238.5   |    ..    |   ..       ..       ..     |\r\n  +--------+-----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------------------------+\r\n\r\nBut upon closer investigation it must be confessed that these\r\nregularities can be called only rules, and not laws. In the first line\r\none would expect that the steps in the values of the atomic weights\r\nshould be regular, but it is not so. There are even cases when it is\r\nnecessary to invert the order of the atomic weights to satisfy the\r\nchemical necessities. Thus argon has a larger number than potassium, but\r\nmust precede it to fit into its proper place. The same is true of\r\ntellurium and iodine. It looks as if the real elements were scattered\r\nsomewhat haphazard on a regular table, or as if some independent factor\r\nwere active to disturb an existing regularity. It may be that the new\r\nfacts mentioned above will lead also to an explanation of these\r\nirregularities; at present we must recognize them and not try to explain\r\nthem away. Such considerations have to be kept in mind especially in\r\nregard to the very numerous attempts to express the series of combining\r\nweights in a mathematical form. In several cases rather surprising\r\nagreements were found, but never without exception. It looks as if some\r\nvery important factor regulating the whole matter is still unknown, and\r\nbefore this has been elucidated no satisfactory treatment of the matter\r\nis possible. It seems therefore premature to enter into the details of\r\nthese speculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transmutation of elements.\r\n\r\nIn recent times not only our belief in the absolute exactness of the law\r\nof the conservation of weight has been shaken, but also our belief in\r\nthe law of the conservation of the elements. The wonderful substance\r\nradium, whose existence has made us to revise quite a number of old and\r\nestablished views, seems to be a fulfilment of the old problem of the\r\nalchemists. It is true that by its help lead is not changed into gold,\r\nbut radium not only changes itself into another element, helium\r\n(Ramsay), but seems also to cause other elements to change. Work in this\r\nline is of present day origin only and we do not know what new laws will\r\nbe found to regulate these most unexpected reactions (see\r\nRADIOACTIVITY). But we realize once more that no law can be regarded as\r\nfree from criticism and limitation; in the whole realm of exact sciences\r\nthere is no such thing as the Absolute.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Prout's assumption.\r\n\r\nAnother question regarding the values of atomic weights was raised very\r\nsoon after their first establishment. From the somewhat inexact first\r\ndeterminations William Prout concluded that all atomic weights are\r\nmultiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen, thus suggesting all other\r\nelements to be probably made up from condensed hydrogen. Berzelius found\r\nhis determinations not at all in accordance with this assumption, and\r\nstrongly opposed the arbitrary rounding off of the numbers practised by\r\nthe partisans of Prout's hypothesis. His hypothesis remained alive,\r\nalthough almost every chemist who did _exact_ atomic weight\r\ndeterminations, especially Stas, contradicted it severely. Even in our\r\ntime it seems to have followers, who hope that in some way the existing\r\nexperimental differences may disappear. But one of the most important\r\nand best-known relations, that between _hydrogen_ and _oxygen_, is\r\ncertainly different from the simple ratio 1 : 16, for it has been\r\ndetermined by a large number of different investigators and by different\r\nmethods to be undoubtedly lower, namely, 1 : 15.87. Therefore, if\r\nProut's hypothesis contain an element of truth, by the act of\r\ncondensation of some simpler substance into the present chemical\r\nelements a change of weight also must have occurred, such that the\r\nweight of the element did not remain exactly the weight of the simpler\r\nsubstance which changed into it. We have already remarked that such\r\nphenomena are not yet known with certainty, but they cannot be regarded\r\nas utterly impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n  International table of atomic weights.\r\n\r\nIt may here be mentioned that the internationality of science has shown\r\nitself active also in the question of atomic weights. These numbers\r\nundergo incessantly small variations because of new work done for their\r\ndetermination. To avoid the uncertainty arising from this inevitable\r\nstate of affairs, an international committee was formed by the\r\nco-operation of the leading chemical societies all over the world, and\r\nan international table of the most probable values is issued every year.\r\nThe following table is that for 1910:--\r\n\r\n  _International Atomic Weights_, 1910.\r\n\r\n                      Atomic  |                        Atomic\r\n                     Weights. |                       Weights.\r\n    Name.

Since the naive statement of\r\nThales that all things came from water, chemists could never reconcile\r\nthemselves to the fact of the conservation of the elements. By an\r\nexperimental investigation which extended over five centuries and more,\r\nthe impossibility of transmuting one element into another--for example,\r\nlead into gold--was demonstrated in the most extended way, and\r\nnevertheless this law has so little entered the consciousness of the\r\nchemists that it is seldom explicitly stated even in carefully written\r\ntext-books. On the other side the attempts to reduce the manifoldness of\r\nthe actual chemical elements to one single primordial matter have never\r\nceased, and the latest development of science seems to endorse such a\r\nview. It is therefore necessary to consider this question from a most\r\ngeneral standpoint.\r\n\r\nIn physical science, the chemical elements may be compared with such\r\nconcepts as _mass_, _momentum_, _quantity of electricity_, _entropy_ and\r\nsuch like. While mass and entropy are determined univocally by a unit\r\nand a number, quantity of electricity has a unit, a number and a sign,\r\nfor it can be positive as well as negative. Momentum has a unit, a\r\nnumber and a direction in space. Elements do not have a common unit as\r\nthe former magnitudes, but every element has its own unit, and there is\r\nno transition from one to another. All these magnitudes underlie a law\r\nof conservation, but to a very different degree. While mass was\r\nconsidered as absolutely invariable in the classical mechanics, the\r\nnewer theories of the electrical constitution of matter make mass\r\ndependent on the velocity of the moving electron. Momentum also is not\r\nentirely conservative because it can be changed by light-pressure.\r\nEntropy is known as constantly increasing, remaining constant only in an\r\nideal limiting case. With chemical elements we observe the same thing as\r\nwith momentum; though till recently considered as conservative, there is\r\nnow experimental evidence that they do not always show this character.\r\n\r\nGenerally the laws of the conservation of mass, weight and elements are\r\nexpressed as the \"law of the conservation of matter.\" But this\r\nexpression lacks scientific exactness because the term \"matter\" is\r\ngenerally not defined exactly, and because only the above-named\r\nproperties of ponderable objects do not change, while all other\r\nproperties do to a greater or less extent. Considered in the most\r\ngeneral way, we may define matter as a complex of gravitational, kinetic\r\nand chemical energies, which are found to cling together in the same\r\nspace. Of these energies the capacity factors, namely, weight, mass and\r\nelements, are conservative as described, while the intensity factors,\r\npotential, velocity and affinity, may change in wide limits. To explain\r\nwhy we find these energies constantly combined one with another, we only\r\nhave to think of a mass without gravity or a ponderable body without\r\nmass. The first could not remain on earth because every movement would\r\ncarry it into infinite space, and the second would acquire infinite\r\nvelocity by the slightest push and would also disappear at once.\r\nTherefore only such objects which have both mass and weight can be\r\nhandled and can be objects of our knowledge. In the same way all other\r\nenergies come to our knowledge only by being (at least temporarily)\r\nassociated with this combination of mass and weight. This is the true\r\nmeaning of the term \"matter.\"\r\n\r\nIn this line of ideas matter appears not at all as a primary concept,\r\nbut as a complex one; there is therefore no reason to consider matter as\r\nthe last term of scientific analysis of chemical facts, and the idea of\r\na primordial matter appears as a survival from the very first beginning\r\nof European natural philosophy. The most general concept science has\r\ndeveloped to express the variety of experience is _energy_, and in terms\r\nof energy (combined with number, magnitudes, time and space) all\r\nobserved and observable experiences are to be described.     (W. O.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEMI, an oleo-resin (Manilla elemi) obtained in the Philippine Islands,\r\nprobably from _Canarium commune_ (nat. ord. Burseraceae), which when\r\nfresh and of good quality is a pale yellow granular substance, of\r\nhoney-like consistency, but which gradually hardens with age. It is\r\nsoluble in alcohol and ether, and has a spicy taste with a smell like\r\nfennel. In the 17th and 18th centuries the term elemi usually denoted an\r\noleo-resin (American or Brazilian elemi) obtained from trees of the\r\ngenus _Icica_ in Brazil, and still earlier it meant oriental or African\r\nelemi, derived from _Boswellia Frereana_, which flourishes in the\r\nneighbourhood of Cape Gardafui. The word, like the older term _animi_,\r\nappears to have been derived from _enhaemon_ (Gr. [Greek: enaimon]), the\r\nname of a styptic medicine said by Pliny to contain tears exuded by the\r\nolive tree of Arabia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEPHANT, the designation of the two existing representatives of the\r\n_Proboscidea_, a sub-order of ungulate mammals, and also extended to\r\ninclude their more immediate extinct relatives. As the distinctive\r\ncharacteristics of the sub-order, and also of the single existing genus\r\n_Elephas_, are given in the article PROBOSCIDEA, it will suffice to\r\npoint out how the two existing species are distinguished from one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe more specialized of the two species is the Indian or Asiatic\r\nelephant, _Elephas maximus_, specially characterized by the extreme\r\ncomplexity of the structure of its molar teeth, which are composed of a\r\ngreat number of tall and thin plates of enamel and dentine, with the\r\nintervals filled by cement (see PROBOSCIDEA, fig. 1). The average number\r\nof plates of the six successive molar teeth may be expressed by the\r\n\"ridge-formula\" 4, 8, 12, 12, 16, 24. The plates are compressed from\r\nbefore backwards, the anterior and posterior surfaces (as seen in the\r\nworn grinding face of the tooth) being nearly parallel. Ears of\r\nmoderate size. Upper margin of the end of the proboscis developed into a\r\ndistinct finger-like process, much longer than the lower margins, and\r\nthe whole trunk uniformly tapering and smooth. Five nails on the\r\nfore-feet, and four (occasionally five) on the hind-feet.\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic elephant inhabits the forest-lands of India, Burma, the\r\nMalay Peninsula, Cochin China, Ceylon and Sumatra. Elephants from the\r\nlast-named islands present some variations from those of the mainland,\r\nand have been separated under the names of _E. zeylonicus_ and _E.\r\nsumatranus_, but they are not more than local races, and the Ceylon\r\nanimal, which is generally tuskless, may be the typical _E. maximus_, in\r\nwhich case the Indian race will be _E. maximus indicus_. The appearance\r\nof the Asiatic elephant is familiar to all. In the wild state it is\r\ngregarious, associating in herds of ten, twenty or more individuals,\r\nand, though it may under certain circumstances become dangerous, it is\r\ngenerally inoffensive and even timid, fond of shade and solitude and the\r\nneighbourhood of water. The height of the male at the shoulder when full\r\ngrown is usually from 8 to 10 ft., occasionally as much as 11, and\r\npossibly even more. The female is somewhat smaller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Asiatic Elephant (_Elephas maximus_).]\r\n\r\nThe following epitome of the habits of the Asiatic elephants is\r\nextracted from _Great and Small Game of India and Tibet_, by R.\r\nLydekker:--\r\n\r\n\"The structure of the teeth is sufficient to indicate that the food\r\nconsists chiefly of grass, leaves, succulent shoots and fruits; and this\r\nhas been found by observation to be actually the case. In this respect\r\nthe Asiatic species differs very widely from its African relative, whose\r\nnutriment is largely composed of boughs and roots. Another difference\r\nbetween the two animals is to be found in the great intolerance of the\r\ndirect rays of the sun displayed by the Asiatic species, which never\r\nvoluntarily exposes itself to their influence. Consequently, during the\r\nhot season in Upper India, and at all times except during the rains in\r\nthe more southern districts, elephants keep much to the denser parts of\r\nthe forests. In Southern India they delight in hill-forest, where the\r\nundergrowth is largely formed of bamboo, the tender shoots of which form\r\na favourite delicacy; but during the rains they venture out to feed on\r\nthe open grass tracts. Water is everywhere essential to their\r\nwell-being; and no animals delight more thoroughly in a bath. Nor are\r\nthey afraid to venture out of their depth, being excellent swimmers, and\r\nable, by means of their trunks, to breathe without difficulty when the\r\nentire body is submerged. The herds, which are led by females, appear in\r\ngeneral to be family parties; and although commonly restricted to from\r\nthirty to fifty, may occasionally include as many as one hundred head.\r\nThe old bulls are very generally solitary for a considerable portion of\r\nthe year, but return to the herds during the pairing season. Some\r\n'rogue' elephants--_gunda_ of the natives--remain, however, permanently\r\nseparated from the rest of their kind. All such solitary bulls, as their\r\ncolloquial name indicates, are of a spiteful disposition; and it appears\r\nthat with the majority the inducement to live apart is due to their\r\npartiality for cultivated crops, into which the more timid females are\r\nafraid to venture. 'Must' elephants are males in a condition\r\nof--probably sexual--excitement, when an abundant discharge of dark oily\r\nmatter exudes from two pores in the forehead. In addition to various\r\nsounds produced at other times, an elephant when about to charge gives\r\nvent to a shrill loud 'trumpet'; and on such occasions rushes on its\r\nadversary with its trunk safely rolled up out of danger, endeavouring\r\neither to pin him to the ground with its tusks (if a male tusker) or to\r\ntrample him to death beneath its ponderous knees or feet.\"\r\n\r\nExact information in regard to the period of gestation of the female is\r\nstill lacking, the length of the period being given from eighteen to\r\ntwenty-two months by different authorities. The native idea, which may\r\nbe true, is that the shorter period occurs in the case of female and the\r\nlonger in that of male calves. In India elephants seldom breed in\r\ncaptivity, though they do so more frequently in Burma and Siam; the\r\ndomesticated stock is therefore replenished by fresh captures.\r\nOccasionally two calves are produced at a birth, although the normal\r\nnumber is one. Calves suckle with their mouths and not with their\r\ntrunks. Unlike the African species, the Indian elephant charges with its\r\ntrunk curled up, and consequently in silence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Immature African Elephant (_Elephas africanus_).]\r\n\r\nAs regards their present distribution in India, elephants are found\r\nalong the foot of the Himalaya as far west as the valley of Dehra-Dun,\r\nwhere the winter temperature falls to a comparatively low point. A\r\nfavourite haunt used to be the swamp of Azufghur, lying among the\r\nsal-forests to the northward of Meerut. In the great tract of forest\r\nbetween the Ganges and Kistna rivers they occur locally as far west as\r\nBilaspur and Mandla; they are met with in the Western Ghats as far north\r\nas between latitude 17 deg. and 18 deg., and are likewise found in the\r\nhill-forests of Mysore, as well as still farther south. In this part of\r\nthe peninsula they ascend the hills to a considerable height, as they do\r\nin the Newara Eliya district of Ceylon, where they have been encountered\r\nat an elevation of over 7000 ft. There is evidence that about three\r\ncenturies ago elephants wandered in the forests of Malwa and Nimar,\r\nwhile they survived to a later date in the Chanda district of the\r\nCentral Provinces. At the comparatively remote epoch when the Deccan was\r\na forest tract, they were probably also met with there, but the swamps\r\nof the Bengal Sundarbans appear unsuited to their habits.\r\n\r\nOf tusks, the three longest specimens on record respectively measure 8\r\nft. 9 in., 8 ft. 2 in. and 8 ft.; their respective weights being 81, 80\r\nand 90 lb. These are, however, by no means the heaviest--one, whose\r\nlength is 7 ft. 3-3/8 in., weighing 102 lb.; while a second, of which\r\nthe length is 7 ft. 3-1/4 in., scaled 97-1/2 lb. Of the largest pair in\r\nthe possession of the British Museum, which belonged to an elephant\r\nkilled in 1866 by Colonel G.M. Payne in Madras, one tusk measures 6 ft.\r\n8 in. in length, and weighs 77-3/4 lb., the other being somewhat\r\nsmaller. It should be added that some of these large tusks came from\r\nCeylon; such tuskers being believed to be descended from mainland\r\nanimals imported into the island. \"White\" elephants are partial or\r\ncomplete albinos, and are far from uncommon in Burma and Siam. Young\r\nIndian elephants are hairy, thus showing affinity with the mammoth.\r\n\r\nThe African elephant is a very different animal from its Asiatic cousin,\r\nboth as regards structure and habits; and were it not for the existence\r\nof intermediate extinct species, might well be regarded as the\r\nrepresentative of a distinct genus. Among its characteristics the\r\nfollowing points are noticeable. The molar teeth are of coarse\r\nconstruction, with fewer and larger plates and thicker enamel; the\r\nridge-formula being 3, 6, 7, 7, 8, 10; while the plates are not\r\nflattened, but thicker in the middle than at the edges, so that their\r\nworn grinding-surfaces are lozenge-shaped. Ears very large. The upper\r\nand lower margins of the end of the trunk form two nearly equal\r\nprehensile lips. Only three toes on the hind-foot. A very important\r\ndistinction is to be found in the conformation of the trunk, which, as\r\nshown in fig. 2, looks as though composed of a number of segments,\r\ngradually decreasing in size from base to tip like the joints of a\r\ntelescope, instead of tapering gradually and evenly from one extremity\r\nto the other. The females have relatively large tusks, which are\r\nessential in obtaining their food. Except where exterminated by human\r\nagency (and this has been accomplished to a deplorable extent), the\r\nAfrican elephant is a native of the wooded districts of the whole of\r\nAfrica south of the Sahara. It is hunted chiefly for the sake of the\r\nivory of its immense tusks, of which it yields the principal source of\r\nsupply to the European market, and the desire to obtain which is rapidly\r\nleading to the extermination of the species. In size the male African\r\nelephant often surpasses the Asiatic species, reaching nearly 12 ft. in\r\nsome cases. The circumference of the fore-foot is half the height at the\r\nshoulder, a circumstance which enables sportsmen to estimate\r\napproximately the size of their quarry. A tusk in the British Museum\r\nmeasures 10 ft. 2 in. in length, with a basal girth of 24 in. and a\r\nweight of 226-1/2 lb.; but a still longer, although lighter, tusk was\r\nbrought to London in 1905.\r\n\r\nSeveral local races of African elephant have been described, mainly\r\ndistinguished from one another by the form and size of the ears, shape\r\nof the head, &c. The most interesting of these is the pigmy Congo race,\r\n_E. africanus pumilio_, named on the evidence of an immature specimen in\r\nthe possession of C. Hagenbeck, the well-known animal-dealer of Hamburg,\r\nin 1905. According to Hagenbeck's estimate, this elephant, which came\r\nfrom the French Congo, was about six years old at the time it came under\r\nscientific notice. Moreover, in the opinion of the same observer, it is\r\nin no wise an abnormally dwarfed or ill-grown representative of the\r\nnormal type of African elephant, but a well-developed adolescent animal.\r\nIn height it stood about the same as a young individual of the ordinary\r\nAfrican elephant when about a year and a half old, the vertical\r\nmeasurement at the shoulder being only 4 ft., or merely a foot higher\r\nthan a new-born Indian elephant. Hagenbeck's estimate of its age was\r\nbased on the presence of well-developed tusks, and the relative\r\nproportion of the fore and hind limbs, which are stated to show\r\nconsiderable differences in the case of the African elephant according\r\nto age. Nothing was stated as to the probability of an increase in the\r\nstature of the French Congo animal as it grows older; but even if we\r\nallow another foot, its height would be considerably less than half that\r\nof a large Central African bull of the ordinary elephant.\r\n\r\nBy Dr Paul Matschie several races of the African elephant have been\r\ndescribed, mainly, as already mentioned, on certain differences in the\r\nshape of the ear. From the two West African races (_E. a. cyclotis_ and\r\n_E. a. oxyotis_) the dwarf Congo elephant is stated to be distinguished\r\nby the shape of its ear; comparison in at least one instance having been\r\nmade with an immature animal. The relatively small size of the ear is\r\none of the most distinctive characteristics of the dwarf race. Further,\r\nthe skin is stated to be much less rough, with fewer cracks, while a\r\nmore important difference occurs in the trunk, which lacks the\r\ntransverse ridges so distinctive of the ordinary African elephant, and\r\nthereby approximates to the Asiatic species.\r\n\r\nIf the differences in stature and form are constant, there can be no\r\nquestion as to the right of the dwarf Congo elephant to rank as a\r\nwell-marked local race; the only point for consideration being whether\r\nit should not be called a species. The great interest in connexion with\r\na dwarf West African race of elephant is in relation to the fossil pigmy\r\nelephants of the limestone fissures and caves of Malta and Cyprus.\r\nAlthough some of these elephants are believed not to have been larger\r\nthan donkeys, the height of others may be estimated at from 4 to 5 ft.,\r\nor practically the same as that of the dwarf Congo race. By their\r\ndescribers, the dwarf European elephants were regarded as distinct\r\nspecies, under the names of _Elephas melitensis_, _E. mnaidriensis_ and\r\n_E. cypriotes_; but since their molar teeth are essentially miniatures\r\nof those of the African elephant, it has been suggested by later\r\nobservers that these animals are nothing more than dwarf races of the\r\nlatter. This view may receive some support from the occurrence of a\r\ndwarf form of the African elephant in the Congo; and if we regard the\r\nlatter as a subspecies of _Elephas africanus_, it seems highly probable\r\nthat a similar position will have to be assigned to the pigmy European\r\nfossil elephants. If, on the other hand, the dwarf Congo elephant be\r\nregarded as a species, then the Maltese and Cyprian elephants may have\r\nto be classed as races of _Elephas pumilio_; or, rather, _E. pumilio_\r\nwill have to rank as a race of the Maltese species. In this connexion it\r\nis of interest to note that, both in the Mediterranean islands and in\r\nWest Africa, dwarf elephants of the African type are accompanied by\r\npigmy species of hippopotamus, although we have not yet evidence to show\r\nthat in Africa the two animals occupy actually the same area. Still, the\r\nclose relationship of the existing Liberian pigmy hippopotamus to the\r\nfossil Mediterranean species is significant, in relation to the\r\nforegoing observations on the elephant.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that fossil remains of the African elephant have been\r\nobtained from Spain, Sicily, Algeria and Egypt, in strata of the\r\nPleistocene age. Some of the main differences in the habits of the\r\nAfrican as distinct from those of the Asiatic elephant have been\r\nmentioned under the heading of the latter species. The most important of\r\nthese are the greater tolerance by the African animal of sunlight, and\r\nthe hard nature of its food, which consists chiefly of boughs and roots.\r\nThe latter are dug up with the tusks; the left one being generally\r\nemployed in this service, and thus becoming much more worn than its\r\nfellow.     (R. L.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEPHANTA ISLE (called by the natives _Gharapuri_), a small island\r\nbetween Bombay and the mainland of India, situated about 6 m. from\r\nBombay. It is nearly 5 m. in circumference, and the few inhabitants it\r\ncontains are employed in the cultivation of rice, and in rearing sheep\r\nand poultry for the Bombay market. The island, till within recent times,\r\nwas almost entirely overgrown with wood; it contains several springs of\r\ngood water. There are also important quarries of building stone. But it\r\nowes its chief celebrity to the mythological excavations and sculptures\r\nof Hindu superstition which it contains. Opposite to the landing-place\r\nwas a colossal statue of an elephant, cracked and mutilated, from which\r\nthe island received from the Portuguese the name it still bears. The\r\nstatue was removed in 1864, and may now be seen in the Victoria Gardens,\r\nBombay. At a short distance from this spot is a cave, the entrance to\r\nwhich is nearly 60 ft. wide and 18 high, supported by pillars cut out of\r\nthe rock; the sides are sculptured into numerous compartments,\r\ncontaining representations of the Hindu deities, but many of the figures\r\nhave been defaced by the zeal of the Mahommedans and Portuguese. In the\r\ncentre of the excavations is a remarkable _Trimurti_ or bust, formerly\r\nthought to represent the Hindu Triad, namely, Brahma the Creator, Vishnu\r\nthe Preserver, and Siva or Mahadeva the Destroyer, but now held to be a\r\ntriform representation of Siva alone. The heads are from 4 to 5 ft. in\r\nlength, and are well cut, and the faces, with the exception of the under\r\nlip, are handsome. The head-dresses are curiously ornamented; and one of\r\nthe figures holds in it's hand a cobra, while on the cap are, amongst\r\nother symbols, a human skull and an infant. On each side of the Trimurti\r\nis a pilaster, the front of which is filled up by a human figure leaning\r\non a dwarf, both much defaced. There is a large compartment to the\r\nright, hollowed a little, and covered with a great variety of figures,\r\nthe largest of which is 16 ft. high, representing the double figure of\r\nSiva and Parvati, named Viraj, half male and half female. On the right\r\nis Brahma, four-faced, on a lotus--one of the very few representations\r\nof this god which now exist in India; and on the left is Vishnu. On the\r\nother side of the Trimurti is another compartment with various figures\r\nof Siva and Parvati, the most remarkable of which is Siva in his\r\nvindictive character, eight-handed, with a collet of skulls round his\r\nneck. On the right of the entrance to the cave is a square apartment,\r\nsupported by eight colossal figures, containing a gigantic symbol of\r\nMahadeva or Siva cut out of the rock. In a ravine connected with the\r\ngreat cave are two other caves, also containing sculptures, which,\r\nhowever, have been much defaced owing to the action of damp and the\r\nfalling of the rocks; and in another hill is a fourth cave. This\r\ninteresting retreat of Hindu religious art is said to have been\r\ndedicated to Siva, but it contains numerous representations of other\r\nHindu deities. It has, however, for long been a place not so much of\r\nworship as of archaeological and artistic interest alike to the European\r\nand Hindu traveller. It forms a wonderful monument of antiquity, and\r\nmust have been a work of incredible labour. Archaeological authorities\r\nare of opinion that the cave must have been excavated about the 10th\r\ncentury of the Christian era, if not earlier. The island is much\r\nfrequented by the British residents of Bombay; and during his tour in\r\nIndia in 1875 King Edward VII., then prince of Wales, was entertained\r\nthere at a banquet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEPHANTIASIS (_Barbadoes leg_; _Boucnemia_), is a disease dependent on\r\nchronic lymphatic obstruction, and characterized by hypertrophy of the\r\nskin and subcutaneous tissue. Two distinct forms are known, (1)\r\nelephantiasis arabum, due to the development of living parasites,\r\nfilaria sanguinis hominis (or filaria Bancrofti), and (2) the\r\nnon-filarial form due to lymphatic obstruction from any other cause\r\nwhatsoever, as erysipelas, the deposit of tuberculous or cancerous\r\nmaterial in the lymphatic glands, phlegmasia dolens (white leg),\r\nlong-continued eczema, &c. The enlargement is limited to a particular\r\npart of the body, generally one, or in rare cases both of the lower\r\nlimbs, occasionally the scrotum, one of the labiae or the mammary gland;\r\nfar more rarely the face. An attack is usually ushered in by febrile\r\ndisturbance (elephantoid fever), the part attacked becoming rapidly\r\nswollen, and the skin tense and red as in erysipelas. The subcutaneous\r\ntissues become firm, infiltrated and hard, pitting only on considerable\r\npressure. The skin becomes roughened with a network of dilated\r\nlymphatics, and vesicles and bullae may form, discharging a chyle-like\r\nfluid when broken (lymphorrhoea). In a later stage still the skin may be\r\ncoarse and wart-like, and there is a great tendency for varicose ulcers\r\nto form. At the end of a variable time enlargement ceases to take place,\r\nand the disease enters a quiescent state: but recrudescences occur at\r\nirregular intervals, always ushered in by elephantoid fever. At the end\r\nof some years the attacks of fever cease, and the affected part remains\r\npermanently swollen. The only difference in the history of the two forms\r\nof the disease lies in the fact that the non-filarial form progresses\r\nsteadily, until either the underlying condition is cured, or in the case\r\nof cancer, &c., brings about a fatal issue. The elephantiasis due to\r\nfilaria is spread by the agency of mosquitoes, in whose bodies the\r\nintermediate stage is passed. The dead mosquito falls upon the water,\r\nwhich thus becomes infected, and hence the ova reach the human stomach.\r\nThe young worm develops, bores through the gastric mucous membrane and\r\nfinally becomes lodged in the lymphatics, usually of one or other of the\r\nextremities. A large number of embryonic filariae are produced. Some\r\nremain in the lymphatic spaces and cause lymphatic obstruction, while\r\nothers enter the blood stream by night (filaria nocturna), or by day\r\n(filaria diurna). It is supposed that a mosquito, biting an infected\r\nperson, itself becomes infected with the blood it abstracts, and that so\r\na new generation is developed.\r\n\r\nTreatment for this condition is unsatisfactory. Occasionally the dilated\r\nlymph trunks can be found, and an operation performed to implant them in\r\nsome vein (lymphangeioplasty). And in some few other cases artificial\r\nlymphatics have been made by introducing sterilized silk thread in the\r\nsubcutaneous tissues of the affected part, and prolonging it into the\r\nnormal tissues. This operation has been most successful when performed\r\non elephantoid arms dependent on a late stage of cancerous breast.\r\nElevation of the limb and elastic pressure should always be tried, but\r\noften amputation has to be resorted to in the end. The disease is\r\ntotally different from the so-called elephantiasis graecorum or true\r\nleprosy, for which see LEPROSY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEPHANT'S-FOOT, the popular name for the plant _Testudinaria\r\nelephantipes_, a native of the Cape of Good Hope. It takes its name from\r\nthe large tuberous stem, which grows very slowly but often reaches a\r\nconsiderable size, e.g. more than 3 yds. in circumference with a height\r\nof nearly 3 ft. above ground. It is rich in starch, whence the name\r\nHottentot bread, and is covered on the outside with thick, hard, corky\r\nplates. It develops slender, leafy, climbing shoots which die down each\r\nseason. It is a member of the monocotyledonous order Dioscoreaceae,\r\nclimbing plants with slender herbaceous or shrubby shoots, to which\r\nbelong the yam and the British black bryony, _Tamus communis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELETS, a town of Russia, in the government of Orel, 122 m. by rail\r\nE.S.E. of Orel, on the railway which connects Riga with Tsaritsyn on the\r\nlower Volga. Pop. (1883) 36,680; (1900) 38,239. Owing to its\r\nadvantageous position Elets has grown rapidly. Its merchants buy large\r\nquantities of grain, and numerous flour-mills, many of them driven by\r\nsteam, prepare flour, which is forwarded to Moscow and Riga. The trade\r\nin cattle is very important. Elets has the first grain elevator erected\r\nin Russia (1887), a railway school, and important tanneries, foundries\r\nfor cast iron and copper, tallow-melting works, limekilns and\r\nbrickworks. The cathedral and two monasteries contain venerated historic\r\nrelics.\r\n\r\nElets is first mentioned in 1147, when it was a fort of Ryazan. The\r\nTurkish Polovtsi or Kumans attacked it in the 12th century, and the\r\nMongols destroyed it during their first invasion (1239) and again in\r\n1305. The Tatars plundered it in 1415 and 1450; and it seems to have\r\nbeen completely abandoned in the latter half of the 15th century. Its\r\ndevelopment dates from the second half of the 17th century, when it\r\nbecame a centre for the trade with south Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEUSIS, an ancient Greek city in Attica about 14 m. N.W. of Athens,\r\noccupying the eastern part of a rocky ridge close to the shore opposite\r\nthe island of Salamis. Its fame is due chiefly to its Mysteries, for\r\nwhich see MYSTERY. Tradition carries back the origin of Eleusis to the\r\nhighest antiquity. In the earlier period of its history it seems to have\r\nbeen an independent rival of Athens, and it was afterwards reckoned one\r\nof the twelve Old Attic cities. A considerable portion of its small\r\nterritory was occupied by the plains of Thria, noticeable for their\r\nfertility, though the hopes of the husbandmen were not unfrequently\r\ndisappointed by the blight of the south wind. To the west was the\r\n[Greek: Pedion Rharion] or Rharian Plain, where Demeter is said to have\r\nsown the first seeds of corn; and on its confines was the field called\r\nOrgas, planted with trees consecrated to Demeter and Persephone. The\r\nsacred buildings were destroyed by Alaric in A.D. 396, and it is not\r\ncertain whether they were restored before the extinction of all pagan\r\nrites by Theodosius. The present village on the site is of Albanian\r\norigin; it is called Lefsina or Lepsina, officially [Greek: Elensis].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Eleusis.]\r\n\r\n_The Site._--Systematic excavations, begun in 1882 by D. Philios for the\r\nGreek Archaeological Society, have laid bare the whole of the sacred\r\nprecinct. It is now possible to trace its boundaries as extended at\r\nvarious periods, and also many successive stages in the history of the\r\nTelesterion, or Hall of Initiation. These complete excavations have\r\nshown the earlier and partial excavations to have been in some respects\r\ndeceptive.\r\n\r\nIn front of the main entrance of the precinct is a large paved area,\r\nwith the foundations of a temple in it, usually identified as that of\r\nArtemis Propylaea; in their present form both area and temple date from\r\nRoman times; and on each side of the Great Propylaea are the foundations\r\nof a Roman triumphal arch. Just below the steps of the Propylaea, on the\r\nleft as one enters, there has been discovered, at a lower level than the\r\nRoman pavement, the curb surrounding an early well. This is almost\r\ncertainly the [Greek: kallichoron phrear] mentioned by Pausanias. The\r\nGreat Propylaea is a structure of Roman imperial date, in close\r\nimitation of the Propylaea on the Athenian Acropolis. It is, however,\r\nset in a wall of 6th-century work, though repaired in later times. This\r\nwall encloses a sort of outer court, of irregular triangular shape. The\r\nSmall Propylaea is not set exactly opposite to the Great Propylaea, but\r\nat an angle to it; an inscription on the architrave records that it was\r\nbuilt by Appius Claudius Pulcher, the contemporary of Cicero. It is also\r\nset in a later wall that occupies approximately the same position as two\r\nearlier ones, which date from the 6th and 5th centuries respectively,\r\nand must have indicated the boundary of the inner precinct. From the\r\nSmall Propylaea a paved road of Roman date leads to one of the doors of\r\nthe Telesterion. Above the Small Propylaea, partly set beneath the\r\noverhanging rock, is the precinct of Pluto; it has a curious natural\r\ncleft approached by rock-cut steps. Several inscriptions and other\r\nantiquities were found here, including the famous head, now in Athens,\r\nusually called Eubouleus, though the evidence for its identification is\r\nfar from satisfactory. A little farther on is a rock-cut platform, with\r\na well, approached by a broad flight of steps, which probably served for\r\nspectators of the sacred procession. Beyond this, close to the side of\r\nthe Telesterion, are the foundations of a temple on higher ground; it\r\nhas been conjectured that this was the temple of Demeter, but there is\r\nno evidence that such a building existed in historic times, apart from\r\nthe Telesterion.\r\n\r\nThe Telesterion, or Hall of Initiation, was a large covered building,\r\nabout 170 ft. square. It was surrounded on all sides by steps, which\r\nmust have served as seats for the mystae, while the sacred dramas and\r\nprocessions took place on the floor of the hall: these seats were partly\r\nbuilt up, partly cut in the solid rock; in later times they appear to\r\nhave been cased with marble. There were two doors on each side of the\r\nhall, except the north-west, where it is cut out of the solid rock, and\r\na rock terrace at a higher level adjoins it; this terrace may have been\r\nthe station of those who were not yet admitted to the full initiation.\r\nThe roof of the hall was carried by rows of columns, which were more\r\nthan once renewed.\r\n\r\nThe architectural history of the hall has been traced by Professor W.\r\nDorpfeld with the help of the various foundations that have been brought\r\nto light. The earliest building on the site is a small rectangular\r\nstructure, with walls of polygonal masonry, built of the rock quarried\r\non the spot. This was succeeded by a square hall, almost of the same\r\nplan as the later Telesterion, but about a quarter of the size; its\r\neastern corner coincides with that of the later building, and it appears\r\nto have had a portico in front like that which, in the later hall, was a\r\nlater addition. Its roof was carried by columns, of which the bases can\r\nstill be seen. This building has with great probability been assigned to\r\nthe time of Peisistratus; it was destroyed by the Persians. Between this\r\nevent and the erection of the present hall, which must be substantially\r\nthe one designed by Ictinus in the time of Pericles, there must have\r\nbeen a restoration, of which we may see the remains in a set of round\r\nsinkings to carry columns, which occur only in the north-east part of\r\nthe hall; a set of bases arranged on a different system occur in the\r\nsouth-west part, and it is difficult to see how these two systems could\r\nbe reconciled unless there were some sort of partition between the two\r\nparts of the hall. Both sets were removed to make way for the later\r\ncolumns, of which the bases and some of the drums still remain. These\r\nlater columns are shown, by inscriptions and other fragments built into\r\ntheir bases, to belong to later Roman times. At the eastern and southern\r\ncorners of the hall of Ictinus are projecting masses of masonry, which\r\nmay be the foundation for a portico that was to be added; but perhaps\r\nthey were only buttresses, intended to resist the thrust of the roof of\r\nthis huge structure, which rested at its northern and western corners\r\nagainst the solid rock of the hill. On the south-east side the hall is\r\nfaced with a portico, extending its whole width; the marble pavement of\r\nthis portico is a most conspicuous feature of Eleusis at the present\r\nday. The portico was added to the hall by the architect Philo, under\r\nDemetrius of Phalerum, about the end of the 4th century B.C. It was\r\nnever completed, for the fluting of its columns still remains\r\nunfinished.\r\n\r\nThe Telesterion took up the greater part of the sacred precinct, which\r\nseems merely to have served to keep the profane away from the temple.\r\nThe massive walls and towers of the time of Pericles, which resemble\r\nthose of a fortress, are quite close in on the south and east; later,\r\nprobably in the 4th century B.C., the precinct was extended farther to\r\nthe south, and at its end was erected a building of considerable extent,\r\nincluding a curious apsidal chamber, for which a similar but larger\r\ncurved structure was substituted in Roman times. This was probably the\r\nBouleuterion. The precinct was full of altars, dedications and\r\ninscriptions; and many fragments of sculptures, pottery and other\r\nantiquities, from the earliest to the latest days of Greece, have been\r\ndiscovered. It is to be noted that the subterranean passages which some\r\nearlier explorers imagined to be connected with the celebration of the\r\nmysteries, have proved to be nothing but cisterns or watercourses.\r\n\r\n  The excavations of Eleusis, and the antiquities found in them, have\r\n  been published from time to time in the [Greek: Ephemeris\r\n  Archaiologike] and in the [Greek: Praktika] of the Greek\r\n  Archaeological Society, especially for 1887 and 1895. See also D.\r\n  Philios, _Eleusis, ses mysteres, ses ruines, et son musee_.\r\n  Inscriptions have also been published in the _Bulletin de\r\n  correspondance hellenique_.     (E. Gr.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEUTHERIUS, pope from about 175 to 189. Allusions to him are found in\r\nthe letters of the martyrs of Lyons, cited by Eusebius, and in other\r\ndocuments of the time. The _Liber Pontificalis_, at the beginning of the\r\n6th century, says that he had relations with a British king, Lucius, who\r\nwas desirous of being converted to Christianity. This tradition--Roman,\r\nnot British--is an enigma to critics, and, apparently, has no historical\r\nfoundation.     (L. D.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEUTHEROPOLIS (Gr. [Greek: Eleuthera polis], \"free city\"), an ancient\r\ncity of Palestine, 25 m. from Jerusalem on the road to Gaza, identified\r\nby E. Robinson with the modern Beit Jibrin. This identification is\r\nconfirmed by Roman milestones in the neighbourhood. It represents the\r\nBiblical Mareshah, the ruins of which exist at Tell Sandahannah close\r\nby. As Betogabra it is mentioned by Ptolemy; the name Eleutheropolis\r\ndates from the Syrian visit of Septimius Severus (A.D. 202). Eusebius in\r\nhis _Onomasticon_ uses it as a central point from which the distances of\r\nother towns are measured. It was destroyed in 796, rebuilt by the\r\ncrusaders in 1134 (their fortress and chapel remain, much ruined). It\r\nwas finally captured by Bibars, 1244. Beit Jibrin is in the centre of a\r\ndistrict of great archaeological interest. Besides the crusader and\r\nother remains in the village itself, the surrounding country possesses\r\nmany _tells_ (mounds) covering the sites of ancient cities. The famous\r\ncaves of Beit Jibrin honeycomb the hills all round. These are immense\r\nartificial excavations of unknown date. Roman milestones and aqueducts\r\nalso are found, and close by the now famous tomb of Apollophanes, with\r\nwall-paintings of animals and other ornamentation, was discovered in\r\n1902; a description of it will be found in Thiersch and Peters, _The\r\nMarissa Tombs_, published by the Palestine Exploration Fund.\r\n     (R. A. S. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEVATORS, LIFTS or HOISTS, machines for raising or lowering loads,\r\nwhether of people or material, from one level to another. They are\r\noperated by steam, hydraulic or electric power, or, when small and\r\nlight, by hand. Their construction varies with the magnitude of the work\r\nto be performed and the character of the motive power. In private\r\nhouses, where only small weights, as coal, food, &c., have to be\r\ntransferred from one floor to another, they usually consist simply of a\r\nsmall counter-balanced platform suspended from the roof or an upper\r\nfloor by a tackle, the running part of which hangs from top to bottom\r\nand can be reached and operated at any level. In buildings where great\r\nweights and numbers of people have to be lifted, or a high speed of\r\nelevation is demanded, some form of motor is necessary. This is usually,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, a steam-engine or occasionally a gas-engine;\r\nsometimes a water-pressure engine is adopted, and it is becoming more\r\nand more common to employ an electric motor deriving its energy from\r\nthe general distribution of the city. Large establishments, hotels or\r\nbusiness houses, commonly have their own source of energy, an electric\r\nor other power \"plant,\" on the premises.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--The Plunger, or Direct Lift Hydraulic Engine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--The Otis Standard Hydraulic Passenger Lift, with\r\nPilot Valve and Lever-operating Device.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Construction of elevators.\r\n\r\nThe hydraulic elevator is the simplest in construction of elevators\r\nproper, sometimes consisting merely of a long pipe set deeply in the\r\nground under the cage and containing a correspondingly long plunger,\r\nwhich rises and falls as required and carries the elevator-cage on its\r\nupper end (fig. 1). The \"stroke\" is thus necessarily equal to the height\r\ntraversed by the cage, with some surplus to keep the plunger steady\r\nwithin its guiding-pipe. The pipe or pump chamber has a length exceeding\r\nthe maximum rise and fall of the plunger, and must be strong enough to\r\nsustain safely the heavy hydraulic pressures needed to raise plunger and\r\ncage with load. The power is usually supplied by a steam pump\r\n(occasionally by a hydraulic motor), which forces water into the chamber\r\nof the great pipe as the elevator rises, a waste-cock drawing off the\r\nliquid in the process of lowering the cage. A single handle within the\r\ncage generally serves to apply the pressure when raising, and to reduce\r\nit when lowering the load. The most common form of hydraulic elevator,\r\nfor important work and under usual conditions of operation, as in\r\ncities, consists of a suspended cage, carried by a tackle, the running\r\npart of which is connected with a set of pulleys at each end of a frame\r\n(fig. 2). The rope is made fast at one end, and its intermediate part is\r\ncarried round first one pulley at the farther end of the frame and then\r\nround another at the nearer end, and so on as often as is found\r\nadvisable in the particular case. The two pulley shafts carrying these\r\ntwo sets of pulleys are made to traverse the frame in such a way as, by\r\ntheir separation, to haul in on the running part, or, by their\r\napproximation, to permit the weight of the cage to haul out the rope. By\r\nthis alternate hauling and \"rendering\" of the rope the cage is raised\r\nand lowered. The use of a number of parallel and independent sets of\r\npulleys and tackles assures safety in case of the breakage of any one,\r\neach being strong enough alone to hold the load. The movement of the\r\npair of pulley shafts is effected by a water-pressure engine, actuating\r\nthe plunger of a pump which is similar to that used in the preceding\r\napparatus, but being relatively of short stroke and large diameter, is\r\nmore satisfactory in design and construction as well as in operation.\r\nElectricity may be applied to elevators of this type by attaching the\r\ntravelling sheaves to a nut in which works a screwed shaft driven by an\r\nelectric motor. In other electric lifts the cables which support the\r\ncage are wound on a drum which is turned by a motor, the drum being\r\nconnected to the motor-shaft either by a series of pinions or by a\r\nworm-gear. The drum may also be worked by a steam or gas engine. Where\r\nthe traffic is not very heavy, a form of elevator that requires no\r\nattendant is convenient. In this any one wishing to use the lift has\r\nmerely to press a button placed by the side of the lift-gate on the\r\nfloor on which he happens to be standing, when the car will come to him;\r\nand having entered it he can cause it to travel to any floor he desires\r\nby pressing another button inside the car. The motive power in such\r\ncases may be either electric or hydraulic, but the control of the\r\nswitches or valves that govern the action of the apparatus is electric.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Essentials of design, &c.\r\n\r\nThe history of the elevator is chronologically extensive, but only since\r\n1850 has rapid or important progress been effected. In that year George\r\nH. Fox & Co. built an elevator operated by the motion of a vertical\r\nscrew, the nut on which carried the cage. This device was used in a\r\nnumber of instances, especially in hotels in the large cities, during\r\nthe succeeding twenty years, and was then generally supplanted by the\r\nhydraulic lift of the kind already described as the plunger-lift. With\r\nthe increased demand for power, speed, safety, convenience of\r\nmanipulation, and comfort in operation, the inventive ability of the\r\nengineer developed the various systems more and more perfectly, and\r\nexperience gradually showed to what service each type was best adapted\r\nand the best construction of each for its peculiar work. Whatever the\r\nclass, the following are the essentials of design, construction and\r\noperation: the elevator must be safe, comfortable, speedy and\r\nconvenient, must not be too expensive in either first cost or\r\nmaintenance, and must be absolutely trustworthy. It must not be liable\r\nto fracture of any element of the hoisting gear that will permit either\r\nthe fall of the cage or its projection by an overweighted balance\r\nupwards against the top of its shaft. It must be possible to stop it,\r\nwhether in regular working or in emergency, or when accident occurs,\r\nwith sufficient promptness, yet without endangering life or property, or\r\neven very seriously inconveniencing the passengers. Acceleration and\r\nretardation in starting and stopping must be smooth and easy, the stop\r\nmust be capable of being made precisely where and when intended, and no\r\ndanger must be incurred by the passengers from contact with running\r\nparts of the mechanism or with the walls and doors of the elevator\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nThese requirements have been fully met in the later forms of elevator\r\ncommonly employed for passenger service. Usual sizes range from loads of\r\n1000 to 5000 lb. with speeds of from 80 to 250 ft. a minute unloaded,\r\nand 75 to 200 ft. loaded, and a height of travel of from 50 to 200 ft.\r\nIn some very tall buildings, as the Singer and Metropolitan buildings in\r\nNew York, elevators have been installed having a maximum speed of 600\r\nft. a minute, with a rise of over 500 ft. Where electric motors are\r\nemployed, their speed ranges from 600 and 700 revolutions per minute in\r\nthe larger to 1000 and 1200 in the smaller sizes, corresponding to from\r\n20 down to 4 or 5 h.p. Two or more counter-weights are employed, and\r\nfrom four to six suspension cables ensure as nearly as possible absolute\r\nsafety. The electric elevators of the Central London railway are\r\nguaranteed to raise 17,000 lb. 65 ft. in some of its shafts, in 30 secs.\r\nfrom start to stop. Over 100,000 ft. of 7/8 in. and 17,000 ft. of 3/4 in.\r\nsteel rope are required for its 24 shafts, and each rope can carry from\r\n16 to 22 tons without breaking. The steel used in the cables, of which\r\nthere are four to six for each car and counter-weight, has a tenacity of\r\n85 to 90 tons per sq. in. of section of wire. The maximum pull on each\r\nset of rope is assumed to be not over 9500 lb., the remainder of the\r\nload being taken by the counterbalance. Oil \"dash-pots\" or buffers, into\r\nwhich enter plungers attached to the bottom of the cage, prevent too\r\nsudden a stop in case of accident, and safety-clutches with friction\r\nadjustments of ample power and fully tested before use give ample\r\ninsurance against a fall even if all the cables should yield at once--an\r\nalmost inconceivable contingency. The efficiency, i.e. the ratio of work\r\nperformed to power expended in the same time, was in these elevators\r\nfound by test to be between 70 and 75%.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Safety Air-Cushion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Safety devices.\r\n\r\nSafety devices constitute perhaps the most important of the later\r\nimprovements in elevator construction where passengers are carried. The\r\nsimplest and, where practicable, most certain of them is the\r\n\"air-cushion\", a chamber into which the cage drops if detached or from\r\nany cause allowed to fall too rapidly to the bottom, compression of the\r\nair bringing it to rest without shock (fig. 3). This chamber must be\r\nperfectly air-tight, except in so far as a purposely arranged clearance\r\naround the sides, diminishing downwards and in well-established\r\nproportion, is adjusted to permit a \"dash-pot\" action and to prevent\r\nrebound. The air-cushion should be about one-tenth the depth of the\r\nelevator shaft; in high buildings it may be a well 20 or 30 ft. deep.\r\nThe Empire building, in New York, is twenty storeys in height, the total\r\ntravel of the cage is 287 ft., and the air-cushion is 50 ft. deep,\r\nextending from the floor of the third storey to the bottom of the shaft.\r\nSliding doors of great strength, and automatic in action, at the first\r\nand second floors, are the only openings. The shaft is tapered for some\r\ndistance below the third floor, and then carried straight to the bottom.\r\nAn inlet valve admits air freely as the cage rises, and an adjusted\r\nsafety-valve provides against excess pressure. A \"car,\" falling freely\r\nfrom the twentieth storey, was checked by this arrangement without\r\ninjury to a basket of eggs placed on its floor. Other safety devices\r\nconsist of catches under the floor of the cage, so arranged that they\r\nare held out of engagement by the pull on the cables. But if the strain\r\nis suddenly relieved, as by breakage of a cable or accident to the\r\nengine or motor, they instantly fly into place and, engaging strong\r\nside-struts in the shaft, hold the car until it can be once more lifted\r\nby its cables. These operate well when the cables part at or near the\r\ncar, but they are apt to fail if the break occurs on the opposite side\r\nof the carrying sheaves at the top of the shaft, since the friction and\r\ninertia of the mass of the cables may in that case be sufficient to hold\r\nthe pawls out of gear either entirely or until the headway is so great\r\nas to cause the smashing of all resistances when they do engage.\r\n\r\nAnother principle employed in safety arrangements is the action of\r\ninertia of parts properly formed and attached. Any dangerous\r\nacceleration of the cage causes the inertia of these parts to produce a\r\nretardation relative to the car which throws into action a brake or a\r\ncatch, and thus controls the motion within safe limits or breaks the\r\nfall. The hydraulic brake has been used in this apparatus, as have\r\nmechanical and pneumatic apparatus. This control of the speed of fall is\r\nmost commonly secured by the employment of a centrifugal or other\r\ngovernor or regulator. The governor may be on the top of the cage and\r\ndriven by a stationary rope fixed between the top and bottom of the\r\nshafts, or it may be placed at the top of the shaft and driven by a rope\r\ntravelling with the car. Its action is usually to trip into service a\r\nset of spring grips or friction clutches, which, as a rule, grasp the\r\nguides of the cage and by their immense pressure and great resultant\r\nfriction bring the cage to rest within a safe limit of speed, time and\r\ndistance. A coefficient of friction of about 15% is assumed in their\r\ndesign, and this estimate is confirmed by their operation. Pressures of\r\n10 tons or more are sometimes provided in these grips to ensure the\r\nfriction required. There are many different forms of safety device of\r\nthese various classes, each maker having his own. The importance of\r\nabsolute safety against a fall is so great that the best builders are\r\nnot satisfied with any one form or principle, but combine provisions\r\nagainst every known danger, and often duplicate such precautions against\r\nthe most common accidents.\r\n\r\nThe \"travelling staircase,\" which may be classed among the passenger\r\nelevators, usually consists of a staircase so constructed that while the\r\npassenger is ascending it the whole structure is also ascending at a\r\npredetermined rate, so that the progress made is the sum of the two\r\nrates of motion. The system of \"treads and risers\" is carried on a long\r\nendless band of chain sustained by guides holding it in its desired\r\nline, and rendering at either end over cylinders or sprockets. The\r\njunctions between the stairway and the upper or lower floors are\r\ningeniously arranged so as to avoid danger of injury to the passengers.\r\n\r\nFreight elevators have the same general forms as the passenger\r\nelevators, but are often vastly larger and more powerful, and are not as\r\na rule fitted up for such heights of lift, or constructed with such\r\nelaborate provision for safety or with any special finish. Elevators\r\nraising grain, coal, earth and similar materials, such as can be taken\r\nup by scooping into a bucket, or can be run into and out of the bucket\r\nby gravity, constitute a class by themselves, and are described in the\r\narticle CONVEYORS.\r\n\r\nThe term \"grain elevator\" is often used to include buildings as well as\r\nmachinery, and it is not unusual in Europe to hear a flour-mill, with\r\nits system of motor machinery, mills, elevator and storage departments,\r\nspoken of as an \"American elevator\" (see GRANARIES).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELF (O. Eng. _aelf_; cf. Ger. _Alp_, nightmare), a diminutive\r\nsupernatural being of Teutonic mythology, usually of a more or less\r\nmischievous and malignant character, causing diseases and evil dreams,\r\nstealing children and substituting changelings, and thus somewhat\r\ndifferent from the Romanic fairy, which usually has less sinister\r\nassociations. The prehistoric arrow-heads and other flint implements\r\nwere in England early known as \"elf-bolts\" or \"elf-arrows,\" and were\r\nlooked on as the weapons of the elves, with which they injured cattle.\r\nSo too a tangle in the hair was called an \"elf-lock,\" as being caused by\r\nthe mischief of the elves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELGAR, SIR EDWARD (1857-   ), English musical composer, son of W.H.\r\nElgar, who was for many years organist in the Roman Catholic church of\r\nSt George at Worcester, was born there on the 2nd of June 1857. His\r\nfather's connexion with music at Worcester, with the Glee Club and with\r\nthe Three Choirs Festivals, supplied him with varied opportunities for a\r\nmusical education, and he learnt to play several instruments. In 1879 he\r\nbecame bandmaster at the county lunatic asylum, and held that post till\r\n1884. He was also a member of an orchestra at Birmingham, and in 1883 an\r\nintermezzo by him was played there at a concert. In 1882 he became\r\nconductor of the Worcester Amateur Instrumental Society; and in 1885 he\r\nsucceeded his father as organist at St George's, Worcester. There he\r\nwrote a certain amount of church music. In 1889 he moved to London, but\r\nfinding no encouragement retired to Malvern in 1891; in 1904 he went to\r\nlive at Hereford, and in 1905 was made professor of music at Birmingham\r\nUniversity. To the public generally he was hardly known till his\r\noratorio _The Dream of Gerontius_ was performed at Birmingham in 1900,\r\nbut this was at once received as a new revelation in English music, both\r\nat home and by Richard Strauss in Germany, and the composer was made a\r\nMus. Doc. at Cambridge. His experience in writing church music for a\r\nRoman Catholic service cannot be overlooked in regard to this and other\r\nworks by Elgar, who came to be regarded as the representative of a\r\nCatholic or neo-Catholic style of religious music, for which an\r\nappreciative public was ready in England at the moment, owing to the\r\nrecent developments in the more artistic and sensuous side of the\r\nreligious movement. And the same interest attached to his later\r\noratorios, _The Apostles_ (1903) and _The Kingdom_ (1906). But Elgar's\r\nsudden rise into popularity, confirmed by his being knighted in 1904,\r\ndrew attention to his other productions. In 1896 his _Scenes from the\r\nSaga of King Olaf_ was recognized by musicians as a fine work, and in\r\nthe same year his _Scenes from the Bavarian Highlands_ and _Lux Christi_\r\nwere performed; and apart from other important compositions, his\r\nsong-cycle _Sea-Pictures_ was sung at Norwich in 1899 by Clara Butt, and\r\nhis orchestral _Variations on an original theme_ were given at a Richter\r\nconcert in the same year. In 1901 his popular march \"Pomp and\r\nCircumstance\" was played at a promenade concert, the stirring melody of\r\nhis song \"Land of Hope and Glory\" being effectually utilized. It is\r\nimpossible here to enumerate all Sir Edward Elgar's works, which have\r\nexcited a good deal of criticism in musical circles without impairing\r\nhis general recognition as one of the few front-rank English composers\r\nof his day; but his most important later production, his first\r\norchestral symphony, produced in 1908 with immediate success, raised his\r\nreputation as a composer to an even higher place, as a work of marked\r\npower and beauty, developing the symphonic form with the originality of\r\na real master of his art. In 1908 he resigned his professorship at\r\nBirmingham University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELGIN, a city of Kane county, Illinois, U.S.A., in the N. part of the\r\nstate, 36 m. N.W. of Chicago. Pop. (1880) 8787; (1890) 17,823; (1900)\r\n22,433, of whom 5419 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 25,976. Elgin is\r\nserved by the Chicago & North-Western and the Chicago, Milwaukee & St\r\nPaul railways, and by interurban electric railways to Chicago, Aurora\r\nand Belvidere. The city is the seat of the Northern Illinois hospital\r\nfor the insane, of the Elgin Academy (chartered 1839; opened 1856), and\r\nof St Mary's Academy (Roman Catholic); and has the Gail Borden public\r\nlibrary, with 35,000 volumes in 1908. The city has six public parks,\r\nLord's Park containing 112, and Wing Park 121 acres. The city is in a\r\nfine dairying region and is an important market for butter. Among\r\nElgin's manufactures are watches and watch-cases, butter and other dairy\r\nproducts, cooperage (especially butter tubs), canned corn, shirts,\r\nfoundry and machine-shop products, pipe-organs, and caskets and casket\r\ntrimmings; in 1905 Elgin's total factory product was valued at\r\n$9,349,274. The Elgin National Watch factory, and the Borden\r\nmilk-condensing works, are famous throughout the United States and\r\nbeyond. The publishing office of the Dunkers, or German Brethren, is at\r\nElgin; and several popular weeklies with large circulations are\r\npublished here. A permanent settlement was made as early as 1835, and\r\nElgin was chartered as a city in 1854 and was rechartered in 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELGIN, a royal, municipal and police burgh, and county town of\r\nElginshire, Scotland, situated on the Lossie, 5 m. S. of Lossiemouth its\r\nport, on the Moray Firth, and 71-1/4 m. N.W. of Aberdeen, with stations\r\non the Great North of Scotland and Highland railways. Pop. (1901) 8460.\r\nIt is a place of very considerable antiquity, was created a royal burgh\r\nby Alexander I., and received its charter from Alexander II. in 1234.\r\nEdward I. stayed at the castle in 1296 and 1303, and it was to blot out\r\nthe memory of his visit that the building was destroyed immediately\r\nafter national independence had been reasserted. The hill on which it\r\nstood was renamed the Ladyhill, and on the scanty ruins of the castle\r\nnow stands a monument to the 5th duke of Gordon, consisting of a column\r\nsurmounted by a statue.\r\n\r\nThe burgh has suffered periodically from fire, notably in 1452, when\r\nhalf of it was burnt by the earl of Huntly. Montrose plundered it twice\r\nin 1645. In 1746 Prince Charles Edward spent a few days in Thunderton\r\nHouse. His hostess, Mrs Anderson, an ardent Jacobite, kept the sheets in\r\nwhich he slept, and was buried in them on her death, twenty-five years\r\nafterwards. For fifty years after this date the place retained the\r\ncharacter and traditions of a sleepy cathedral city, but with the\r\napproach of the 19th century it was touched by a more modern spirit. As\r\nthe result much that was picturesque disappeared, but the prosperity of\r\nElgin was increased, so that now, owing to its pleasant situation in\r\n\"the Garden of Scotland,\" its healthy climate, cheap living, and\r\nexcellent educational facilities, it has become a flourishing community.\r\nThe centre of interest is the cathedral of Moray, which was founded in\r\n1224, when the church of the Holy Trinity was converted to this use. It\r\nwas partially burned in 1270 and almost destroyed in 1390 by Alexander\r\nStewart, the Wolf of Badenoch, natural son of Robert II., who had\r\nincurred the censure of the Church. In 1402 Alexander, lord of the\r\nIsles, set fire to the town, but spared the cathedral for a\r\nconsideration, in memory of which mercy the Little Cross (so named to\r\ndistinguish it from the Muckle or Market Cross, restored in 1888) was\r\nerected. After these outrages it was practically rebuilt on a scale of\r\ngrandeur that made it the most magnificent example of church\r\narchitecture in the north. Its design was that of a Jerusalem cross,\r\nwith two flanking towers at the east end, two at the west end, and one\r\nin the centre, at the intersection of the roofs of the nave and\r\ntransepts. It measured 282 ft. long from east to west by 120 ft. across\r\nthe transepts, and consisted of the choir, the gable of which was\r\npierced by two tiers of five lancet windows and the Omega rose window;\r\nthe north transept, in which the Dunbars were buried, and the south\r\ntransept, the doorway of which is interesting for its dog's-tooth\r\nornamentation; and the nave of five aisles. The grand entrance was by\r\nthe richly carved west door, above which was the Alpha window. The\r\ncentral steeple fell in 1506, but was rebuilt, the new tower with its\r\nspire reaching a height of 198 ft. By 1538 the edifice was complete in\r\nevery part. Though the Reformation left it unscathed, it suffered wanton\r\nviolence from time to time. By order of the privy council the lead was\r\nstripped off the roofs in 1567 and sold to Holland to pay the troops;\r\nbut the ship conveying the spoils foundered in the North Sea. In 1637\r\nthe roof-tree of the choir perished during a gale, and three years later\r\nthe rich timber screen was demolished. The central tower again collapsed\r\nin 1711, after which the edifice was allowed to go to ruin. Its stones\r\nwere carted away, and the churchyard, overgrown with weeds, became the\r\ndumping-ground for rubbish. It lay thus scandalously neglected until\r\n1824, when John Shanks, a \"drouthy\" cobbler, was appointed keeper. By a\r\nspecies of inspiration this man, hitherto a ne'er-do-well, conceived the\r\nnotion of restoring the place to order. Undismayed, he attacked the mass\r\nof litter and with his own hands removed 3000 barrow-loads. When he died\r\nin 1841 he had cleared away all the rubbish, disclosed the original\r\nplan, and collected a quantity of fragments. A tablet, let into the\r\nwall, contains an epitaph by Lord Cockburn, recording Shanks's services\r\nto the venerable pile, which has since been entrusted to the custody of\r\nthe commissioners of woods and forests. The chapter-house, to the\r\nnorth-east of the main structure, suffered least of all the buildings,\r\nand contains a 'Prentice pillar, of which a similar story is told to\r\nthat of the ornate column in Roslin chapel. In the lavatory, or\r\nvestibule connecting the chapter-house with the choir, Marjory Anderson,\r\na poor half-crazy creature, a soldier's widow, took up her quarters in\r\n1748. She cradled her son in the piscina and lived on charity. In the\r\ncourse of time the lad joined the army and went to India, where he rose\r\nto the rank of major-general and amassed a fortune of L70,000 with which\r\nhe endowed the Elgin Institution (commonly known as the Anderson\r\nInstitution) at the east end of High Street, for the education of youth\r\nand the support of old age. Within the precincts of the cathedral\r\ngrounds stood the bishop's palace (now in ruins), the houses of the dean\r\nand archdeacon (now North and South Colleges), and the manses of the\r\ncanons. Other ecclesiastical buildings were the monasteries of\r\nBlackfriars (1230) and Greyfriars (1410) and the preceptory of\r\nMaisondieu (1240). They also were permitted to fall into decay, but the\r\n3rd marquess of Bute undertook the restoration of the Greyfriars'\r\nchapel. The parish church, in the Greek style, was built in 1828. Gray's\r\nhospital, at the west end of High Street, was endowed by Dr Alexander\r\nGray (1751-1808), and at the east end stands the Institution, already\r\nmentioned, founded by General Andrew Anderson (1746-1822). Other public\r\nbuildings include the assembly rooms, the town-hall, the museum (in\r\nwhich the antiquities and natural history of the shire are abundantly\r\nillustrated), the district asylum, the academy, the county buildings and\r\nthe court house, the market buildings, the Victoria school of science\r\nand art, and Lady Gordon-Cumming's children's home. In 1903 Mr G.A.\r\nCooper presented his native town with a public park of 42 acres,\r\ncontaining lakes representing on a miniature scale the British Isles.\r\nGrant Lodge, an old mansion of the Grant family, occupying the\r\nsouth-west corner of the park, was converted into the public library.\r\nFrom the top of Ladyhill the view commands the links of the Lossie and\r\nthe surrounding country, and a recreation ground is laid out on Lossie\r\nGreen.\r\n\r\nThe industries include distilling and brewing, nursery gardening,\r\ntanning, saw and flour mills, iron-foundries and manufactures of\r\nwoollens, tweeds and plaiding, and the quarrying of sandstone. Elgin\r\ncombines with Banff, Cullen, Inverurie, Kintore and Peterhead to return\r\none member to parliament, and the town is controlled by a council with\r\nprovost and bailies.\r\n\r\nTwo miles and a half S. by W. of Elgin stands the church of Birnie, with\r\nthe exception of the church at Mortlach in Banffshire probably the\r\noldest place of public worship in Scotland still in use. It is not later\r\nthan 1150 and, with its predecessor, was the cathedral of Moray during\r\nthe rule of the first four bishops; the fourth bishop, Simon de Toeny,\r\nan Englishman, was buried in its precincts in 1184. In the church is\r\npreserved an old Celtic altar-bell of hammered iron, known as the\r\n\"Ronnell bell.\" Such is the odour of sanctity of this venerable church\r\nthat there is an old local saying that \"to be thrice prayed for in the\r\nkirk of Birnie will either mend or end ye.\" Six miles to the S.W. of\r\nElgin, charmingly situated in a secluded valley encircled by fir-clad\r\nheights, lie the picturesque remains of Pluscarden Priory, a Cistercian\r\nhouse founded by Alexander II. in 1230. The ruins, consisting of tower,\r\nchoir, chapter-house, refectory and other apartments, are nearly hidden\r\nfrom view by their dense coating of ivy and the fine old trees,\r\nincluding many beautiful examples of copper beech, by which they are\r\nsurrounded. Its last prior, Alexander Dunbar, died in 1560. The _Liber\r\nPluscardensis_, a valuable authority on early Scots history, was\r\ncompiled in the priory by Maurice Buchanan in 1461. The chronicle comes\r\ndown to the death of James I. The 3rd marquess of Bute acquired the\r\nruins in 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELGIN AND KINCARDINE, EARLS OF. THOMAS BRUCE, 7th earl of Elgin\r\n(1766-1841), British diplomatist and art collector, was born on the 20th\r\nof July 1766, and in 1771 succeeded his brother in the Scottish peerage\r\nas the 7th earl of Elgin (cr. 1633), and 11th of Kincardine (cr. 1647).\r\nHe was educated at Harrow and Westminster, and, after studying for some\r\ntime at the university of St Andrews, proceeded to the continent, where\r\nhe studied international law at Paris, and military science in Germany.\r\nWhen his education was completed he entered the army, in which he rose\r\nto the rank of general. His chief attention was, however, devoted to\r\ndiplomacy. In 1792 he was appointed envoy at Brussels, and in 1795 envoy\r\nextraordinary at Berlin; and from 1799 to 1802 he was envoy\r\nextraordinary at the Porte. It was during his stay at Constantinople\r\nthat he formed the purpose of removing from Athens the celebrated\r\nsculptures now known as the Elgin Marbles. His doing so was censured by\r\nsome as vandalism, and doubts were also expressed as to the artistic\r\nvalue of many of the marbles; but he vindicated himself in a pamphlet\r\npublished in 1810, and entitled _Memorandum on the Subject of the Earl\r\nof Elgin's Pursuits in Greece_. In 1816 the collection was purchased by\r\nthe nation for L36,000, and placed in the British Museum, the outlay\r\nincurred by Lord Elgin having been more than L50,000. Lord Elgin was a\r\nScottish representative peer for fifty years. He died at Paris on the\r\n14th of November 1841.\r\n\r\nJAMES BRUCE, 8th earl of Elgin (1811-1863), British statesman, eldest\r\nson of the 7th earl by his second marriage, was born in 1811, and\r\nsucceeded to the peerage as 8th earl of Elgin and 12th of Kincardine in\r\n1841. He was educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he had\r\nas companions and rivals his younger predecessors in the office of\r\ngovernor-general of India, Dalhousie and Canning. He began his official\r\ncareer in 1842 at the age of thirty, as governor of Jamaica. During an\r\nadministration of four years he succeeded in winning the respect of all\r\nclasses. He improved the condition of the negroes and conciliated the\r\nplanters by working through them. In 1846 Lord Grey appointed him\r\ngovernor-general of Canada. Son-in-law of the popular earl of Durham, he\r\nwas well received by the colonists, and he set himself deliberately to\r\ncarry out the Durham policy. In this his frank and genial manners aided\r\nhim powerfully. His assent to the local measure for indemnifying those\r\nwho had suffered in the troubles of 1837 led the mob of Montreal to pelt\r\nhis carriage for the rewarding of rebels for rebellion, as Mr Gladstone\r\ndescribed it. But long before his eight years' term of service expired\r\nhe was the most popular man in Canada. His relations with the United\r\nStates, his hearty support of the self-government and defence of the\r\ncolony, and his settlement of the free-trade and fishery questions, led\r\nto his being raised in 1849 to the British peerage as Baron Elgin.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return to England in 1854, Lord Palmerston offered him a\r\nseat in the cabinet as chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, which he\r\ndeclined. But when, in 1856 the seizure of the \"Arrow\" by Commissioner\r\nYeh plunged England into war with China, he at once accepted the\r\nappointment of special envoy with the expedition. On reaching Point de\r\nGalle he was met by a force summoned from Bombay to Calcutta by the news\r\nof the sepoy mutiny at Meerut on the 11th of May. His first idea, that\r\nthe somewhat meagre intelligence would justify most energetic action in\r\nChina, was at once changed when urgent letters from Lord Canning reached\r\nhim at Singapore, the next port, on the 3rd of June. H.M.S. \"Shannon\"\r\nwas at once sent on to Calcutta with the troops destined for China, and\r\nLord Elgin himself followed it, when gloomier letters from India reached\r\nhim. The arrival of the \"Shannon\" gave new life to the handful of white\r\nmen fighting for civilization against fearful odds, and before the\r\nreinforcements from England arrived the back of the mutiny had been\r\nbroken. Nor was the position in China seriously affected by the want of\r\nthe troops. Lord Elgin sent in his ultimatum to Commissioner Yeh at\r\nCanton on the same day, the 12th of December, that he learned the relief\r\nof Lucknow, and he soon after sent Yeh a prisoner to Calcutta. By July\r\n1858, after months of Chinese deception, he was able to leave the Gulf\r\nof Pechili with the emperor's assent to the Treaty of Tientsin.\r\nSubsequently he visited Japan, and obtained less considerable\r\nconcessions from its government in the Treaty of Yeddo. It is true that\r\nthe negotiations were confined to the really subordinate Tycoon or\r\nShogun, but that visit proved the beginning of British influence in the\r\nmost progressive country of Asia. Unfortunately, the Chinese difficulty\r\nwas not yet at an end. After tedious disputes with the tariff\r\ncommissioners as to the opium duty, and a visit to the upper waters of\r\nthe Yang-tzse, Lord Elgin had reached England in May 1859. But when his\r\nbrother and the allied forces attempted to proceed to Peking with the\r\nratified treaty, they were fired on from the Taku forts at the mouth of\r\nthe Peiho. The Chinese had resolved to try the fortune of war once more,\r\nand Lord Russell again sent out Lord Elgin as ambassador extraordinary\r\nto demand an apology for the attack, the execution of the treaty, and an\r\nindemnity for the military and naval expenditure. Sir Robert Napier\r\n(afterwards Lord Napier of Magdala) and Sir Hope Grant, with the French,\r\nso effectually routed the Tatar troops and sacked the Summer Palace\r\nthat by the 24th of October 1860 a convention was concluded which was\r\n\"entirely satisfactory to Her Majesty's government.\" Lord Elgin had not\r\nbeen a month at home when Lord Palmerston selected him to be viceroy and\r\ngovernor-general of India. He had now attained the object of his\r\nhonourable ambition, after the office had been filled in most critical\r\ntimes by his juniors and old college companions, the marquis of\r\nDalhousie and Earl Canning. He succeeded a statesman who had done much\r\nto reorganize the whole administration of India, shattered as it had\r\nbeen by the mutiny. But, as the first viceroy directly appointed by the\r\nCrown, and as subject to the secretary of state for India, Lord Elgin at\r\nonce gave up all Lord Canning had fought for, in the co-ordinate\r\nindependence, or rather the stimulating responsibility, of the\r\ngovernor-general, which had prevailed from the days of Clive and Warren\r\nHastings. On the other hand, he loyally carried out the wise and\r\nequitable policy of his predecessor towards our feudatories with a\r\nfirmness and a dignity that in the case of Holkar and Udaipur had a good\r\neffect. He did his best to check the aggression of the Dutch in Sumatra,\r\nwhich was contrary to treaty, and he supported Dost Mahommed in Kabul\r\nuntil that aged warrior entered the then neutral and disputed territory\r\nof Herat. Determined to maintain inviolate the integrity of our own\r\nnorth-west frontier, Lord Elgin assembled a camp of exercise at Lahore,\r\nand marched a force to the Peshawar border to punish those branches of\r\nthe Yusufzai tribe who had violated the engagements of 1858.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of this \"little war\" that he died. Soon after his\r\narrival at Calcutta, he had projected the usual tour to Simla, to be\r\nfollowed by an inspection of the Punjab and its warlike ring-fence of\r\nPathans. He even contemplated the summoning of the central legislative\r\ncouncil at Lahore. After passing the summer of 1863 in the cool retreat\r\nof Peterhoff, Simla, Lord Elgin began a march across the hills from\r\nSimla to Sialkot by the upper valleys of the Beas, the Ravi and the\r\nChenab, chiefly to decide the two allied questions of tea cultivation\r\nand trade routes to Kashgar and Tibet. The climbing up to the Rotung\r\nPass (13,000 ft.) which separates the Beas valley from that of the\r\nChenab, and the crossing of the frail twig bridge across the Chundra\r\ntorrent, prostrated him by the time he had descended into the smiling\r\nEnglish-like Kangra valley. Thence he wrote his last letter to Sir\r\nCharles Wood, still full of hope and not free from anxiety as to the\r\nSittana expedition. At the lovely hill station of Dharmsala, \"the place\r\nof piety,\" he died of fatty degeneration of heart on the 20th of\r\nNovember 1863.\r\n\r\nFor his whole career see _Letters and Journals of James, Eighth Earl of\r\nElgin_, edited by Walrond, but corrected by his brother-in-law, Dean\r\nStanley; for the China missions see _Narrative of the Earl of Elgin's\r\nMission to China and Japan_, by Laurence Oliphant, his private\r\nsecretary; for the brief Indian administration see the _Friend of India_\r\nfor 1862-1863.\r\n\r\nVICTOR ALEXANDER BRUCE, 9th earl of Elgin (1849-   ), British statesman,\r\nwas born on the 16th of May 1849, the son of the 8th earl, and was\r\neducated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford. In 1863 he succeeded as\r\n9th earl of Elgin and 13th of Kincardine. A Liberal in politics, he\r\nbecame first commissioner of works (1886), and subsequently viceroy of\r\nIndia (1894-1899). His administration in India was chiefly notable for\r\nthe frontier risings of 1897-1898. The Afridis broke out into a\r\nfanatical revolt and through hesitation on the part of the government\r\nwere allowed to seize the Khyber Pass, necessitating the Tirah\r\nExpedition. After his return to England he was nominated chairman of the\r\nroyal commission to investigate the conduct of the South African War;\r\nand on the formation of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's ministry in\r\nDecember 1905, he became a member of the cabinet as secretary of state\r\nfor the colonies. In this capacity, though he showed many statesmanlike\r\nqualities, he was somewhat overshadowed by his brilliant under-secretary\r\nin the Commons, Mr Winston Churchill, whose speeches on colonial affairs\r\nwere as aggressive as Lord Elgin's were cautious; and when in April\r\n1908, Mr Asquith became prime minister, Lord Elgin retired from the\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELGINSHIRE, or MORAY (Gaelic \"among the seaboard men\"), a northern\r\ncounty of Scotland, bounded N. by the Moray Firth, E. and S.E. by\r\nBanffshire, S. and S.W. by Inverness and W. by Nairnshire. It comprises\r\nonly the eastern portion of the ancient province of Moray, which\r\nextended from the Spey to the Beauly and from the Grampians to the sea,\r\nembracing an area of about 3900 sq. m. The area of the county is 305,119\r\nacres, or 477 sq. m.\r\n\r\nElginshire is naturally divided into two sections, the level and fertile\r\ncoast and its hinterland--\"the Laigh o' Moray,\" a tract 30 m. long by\r\nfrom 5 to 12 m. broad--and the hilly country in the south. There are,\r\nhowever, no high mountains. Carn Ruigh (1784 ft.), Larig Hill (1783) and\r\nCarn Kitty (1711) are the chief eminences in the south-central district\r\nuntil the ridge of the Cromdale Hills is reached on the Banffshire\r\nborder, where the highest point is 2329 ft. above the sea. The two most\r\nimportant rivers, the Spey (q.v.) and the Findhorn, both have their\r\nsources in Inverness-shire. About 50 m. of the course of the Spey are in\r\nElginshire, to which it may be roughly said to serve as the boundary\r\nline on the south-east and east. The Findhorn rises in the Monadliadh\r\nMountains which form the watershed for several miles between it and the\r\nSpey. Of its total course of nearly 70 m. only the last 12 are in the\r\ncounty, where it separates the woods of Altyre from the Forest of\r\nDarnaway, before entering the Moray Firth in a bay on the north-eastern\r\nshore to which it has given its name. During the first 7 m. of its flow\r\nin Elginshire the stream passes through some of the finest scenery in\r\nScotland. It is liable to sudden risings, and in the memorable Moray\r\nfloods of August 1829 wrought the greatest havoc. Of other rivers the\r\nLossie rises in the small lakes on the flanks of Carn Kitty and pursues\r\na very winding course of 34 m. till it reaches the Moray Firth;\r\nBallintomb Burn, Rothes Burn and Tulchan Burn are left-hand affluents of\r\nthe Spey; the Dorbock and Divie, uniting their forces near Dunphail\r\nHouse, join the Findhorn at Relugas; and Muckle Water, a left-hand\r\ntributary of the Findhorn, comes from Nairnshire. The Spey and Findhorn\r\nare famous for salmon, but some of the smaller streams, too, afford good\r\nsport. The lochs are few and unimportant, among them being Loch Spynie,\r\n2-1/2 m. N., and Loch-na-Bo, 4 m. S.E. of Elgin; Loch of Blairs, 2-1/2\r\nm. S. of Forres; Loch Romach, 3 m. S. of Rafford; Loch Dallas, about 4\r\nm. S.W. of Dallas, and Lochindorb in the S.W., 6 m. N.N.W. of Grantown.\r\nLoch Spynie was once a lake extending from the Firth to within 2-1/2 m.\r\nof Elgin and covering an area of over 2000 acres. Its shores were the\r\nhaunt of a great variety of birds, and its waters were full of salmon,\r\nsea-trout and pike. But early in the 19th century it was resolved to\r\nreclaim the land, and the drainage works then undertaken reduced the\r\nbeautiful loch to a swamp of some 120 acres.\r\n\r\nLochindorb is now the largest lake, being 2 m. in length and fully 1/2 m.\r\nwide. In the upper end, on an island believed to be artificial, stand\r\nthe ruins of Lochindorb Castle, in the 14th century the stronghold of\r\nthe Wolf of Badenoch, and afterwards successively the property of the\r\nearl of Moray, the Campbells of Cawdor and the earl of Seafield. Sir\r\nThomas Dick Lauder saw at Cawdor Castle a massive iron gate which,\r\naccording to tradition, Sir Donald Campbell of Cawdor carried on his\r\nback from Lochindorb to Cawdor, a distance of 13 m. In the southern half\r\nof the county, amongst the hills, are several glens, among them the Glen\r\nof Rothes, Glen Lossie, Glen Gheallaidh, Glen Tulchan and Glen Beag.\r\nStrathspey, though more of a valley than a glen, is remarkable for its\r\nextent and beauty.\r\n\r\n  _Geology._--This county may be divided geologically into two areas,\r\n  the hilly region to the south being composed of the crystalline\r\n  schists of the Central Highlands and the fertile plain of Moray being\r\n  made up of Old Red Sandstone and Triassic strata. In the Cromdale\r\n  Hills in the south-east of the county the metamorphic series comprises\r\n  schistose quartzite, quartz-schists, micaceous flagstones and\r\n  mica-schists, which are granulitic and holocrystalline, the dark\r\n  laminae in some cases containing heavy residues such as ilmenite and\r\n  zircon. The greater portion of the metamorphic area west of the Spey\r\n  consists of granulitic quartz-biotite-granulites and bands of\r\n  muscovite-biotite-schist belonging to the Moine series of the\r\n  Geological Survey (see SCOTLAND: _Geology_). In certain areas these\r\n  are permeated by granitic material in the form of thin strings, knots\r\n  and veins. Excellent sections of these rocks are exposed in the\r\n  Findhorn, the Divie and the tributaries of the Spey. Near Grantown\r\n  there is a group locally developed, comprising crystalline limestone\r\n  with tremolite, kyanite gneiss, muscovite-biotite-schist and\r\n  quartzite, the age and relations of which are still uncertain. The\r\n  general strike of the crystalline schists, save where there are local\r\n  deflections, is north-east and south-west, and the general dip is to\r\n  the south-east. Between Lochindorb and Grantown there is a mass of\r\n  granite belonging to the later intrusions of the Highlands represented\r\n  by the Cairngorm granite. Within the county there are representatives\r\n  of the middle and upper divisions of the Old Red Sandstone resting\r\n  unconformably on the crystalline schists. The strata of the middle or\r\n  Orcadian series consist of conglomerates, sandstones, shales and\r\n  clays, with limestone nodules containing fish remains. This sequence\r\n  is well displayed in the banks of the Spey north of Boat of Bridge and\r\n  in the Tynet Burn east of Fochabers, the latter being one of the\r\n  well-known localities for ichthyolites in the middle or Orcadian\r\n  division. In the Tynet and Gollachie Burn sections, the fish bed is\r\n  overlaid by conglomerates and red pebbly sandstones, passing upwards\r\n  into a thin zone of andesite lavas, indicating contemporaneous\r\n  volcanic action. West of the Tynet Burn and Spey sections there is no\r\n  trace of the members of the Orcadian division till we reach the Muckle\r\n  Burn and Lethen Bar in Nairnshire, save the coarse conglomerate\r\n  filling the ancient hollow of the valley of Rothes which may belong to\r\n  the middle series. In that direction they are overlapped by the Upper\r\n  Old Red Sandstone, which in the river Lossie, in the Lochty Burn and\r\n  the Findhorn rest directly on the metamorphic rocks. Even to the south\r\n  of the main boundary of the upper division there are small outliers of\r\n  that series resting on the crystalline schists. Hence there must be a\r\n  discordance between the Middle and Upper Old Red Sandstone in this\r\n  county. The strata of the upper division consist of red, grey and\r\n  yellow false-bedded sandstones with conglomeratic bands, which are\r\n  well seen in the Findhorn between Sluie and Cothall, where they are\r\n  associated with a bed of cornstone, all dipping to the N.N.W. at\r\n  gentle angles. South of Elgin they are exposed in the Lossie and at\r\n  Scaat Craig, while to the north of that town they extend along the\r\n  ridge from Bishopmill to Alves. By means of the fish remains, which\r\n  occur at Scaat Craig, in the Bishopmill quarries, at Alves, in the\r\n  Findhorn cliffs and in the Whitemyre quarry on the Muckle Burn, the\r\n  Upper Old Red Sandstone in this county is arranged in two groups, the\r\n  Alves and Rosebrae. In the area lying to the north of the Upper Old\r\n  Red Sandstone ridge at Bishopmill and Quarrywood, the strata of\r\n  Triassic age occur, where they consist of pale grey and yellow\r\n  sandstones and a peculiar cherty and calcareous band, known as the\r\n  cherty rock of Stotfield. The sandstones are visible in quarries on\r\n  the north slope of Quarry Wood, at Findrassie, at Spynie and along the\r\n  ridge and sea-shore between Burghead and Lossiemouth. They are\r\n  invested with special interest on account of the remarkable series of\r\n  reptilian remains obtained from them, comprising _Stagonolepis_, a\r\n  crocodile allied to the modern caiman in form; _Telerpeton_ and\r\n  _Hyperodapedon_, species of lizards; _Dicynodonts_ (_Gordonia_ and\r\n  _Geikia_) and a horned reptile, _Elginia mirabilis_ (see SCOTLAND:\r\n  _Geology_). The palaeontological evidence points to the conclusion\r\n  that these reptiliferous sandstones must belong in part to the Trias,\r\n  indeed it is possible that the lower portion may be of Permian age. In\r\n  the Cutties Hillock quarry west of Elgin these reptiliferous beds rest\r\n  directly on the sandstones containing _Holoptychius_ of Upper Old Red\r\n  Sandstone age, so that the apparent conformability must be entirely\r\n  deceptive. Within the area occupied by the Trias west of Stotfield,\r\n  flagstones appear, charged with fish scales of Upper Old Red age,\r\n  where they form a low ridge protruding through the younger strata.\r\n  Both the Upper Old Red and Triassic sandstones have been largely\r\n  quarried for building purposes. On the shore at Lossiemouth there is a\r\n  patch of greenish white sandstones yielding fossils characteristic of\r\n  the Lower Oolite.\r\n\r\n  The glacial deposits distributed over the fertile plain of Moray and\r\n  in the upland valleys are of interest. The low grounds were crossed by\r\n  the ice descending the Moray Firth in an easterly and south-easterly\r\n  direction, which carried boulders of granite from Strath Nairn and\r\n  augen gneiss from Easter Ross. In the Elgin district, boulders\r\n  belonging to the horizons of the Lower and Middle Lias, the Oxford\r\n  Clay and the Upper Chalk are found both in the glacial deposits and on\r\n  the surface of the ground. The largest transported mass occurs at\r\n  Linksfield, where a succession of limestones and shales rests on\r\n  boulder clay and is covered by it, which from the fossils may be of\r\n  Rhaetic or Lower Lias age.\r\n\r\n_Climate and Agriculture._--The climate of the coast is equable and\r\nmild, even exotic fruits ripening readily in the open. The uplands are\r\ncolder and damp. The average temperature in January is 38 deg. F. and in\r\nJuly 58.5 deg., while for the year the mean is 47 deg. F. The rainfall\r\nfor the year averages 26 in. Considering its latitude and the extent of\r\nits arable land the standard of farming in Elginshire is high. The rich\r\nsoil of the lowlands is well adapted for wheat, barley and oats. The\r\nacreage confined to the glens and straths under barley approximates\r\nthat under oats. In the uplands, oats is the principal cereal. The\r\nbreeding of live-stock is profitable, and some of the finest specimens\r\nof shorthorned and polled cattle and of crosses between the two are\r\nbred. On the larger farms in the Laigh Leicester sheep are kept all the\r\nyear round, but in the uplands the Blackfaced take their place. Large\r\nnumbers of horses and pigs are also raised.\r\n\r\n_Other Industries._--Whisky is the chief product, and the numerous\r\ndistilleries are usually busy. There are woollen mills at Elgin and\r\nelsewhere and chemical works at Forres and Burghead. Owing to the\r\nabsence of coal what little mineral wealth there is (iron and lead)\r\ncannot be remuneratively worked. The sandstone quarries, yielding a\r\nbuilding-stone of superior quality, are practically inexhaustible. The\r\nplantations mainly consist of larch and fir and, to a smaller extent, of\r\noak. Much timber was once floated down the Spey and other rivers, but,\r\nsince the increased facilities of carriage afforded by the railways,\r\ntrees have been felled on a wider scale. Boat-building is carried on at\r\nBurghead, Lossiemouth and Kingston--so-called from the fact that a firm\r\nfrom Kingston-on-Hull laid down a yard there in 1784--while at Garmouth\r\nthe fishing fleet lies up during the winter and is also repaired there.\r\nThe Firth fisheries are of considerable value. The boats go out from\r\nFindhorn, Burghead, Hopeman and Lossiemouth, which are all furnished\r\nwith safe harbours. Findhorn has been twice visited by calamities. The\r\nfirst village was overwhelmed by the drifting sands of Culbin, and the\r\nsecond was buried beneath the waves in 1701. Kingston harbour is tidal,\r\nexposed, and liable to interruption from a shifting bar. The deep sea\r\nfisheries comprise haddock, cod, ling and herring, and the Spey,\r\nFindhorn and Lossie yield large quantities of salmon.\r\n\r\nThe Great North of Scotland railway enters the shire in the S.E. from\r\nCraigellachie, whence a branch runs up the Spey to Boat of Garten in\r\nInverness-shire, and in the N.E. from Port Gordon, running in both cases\r\nto Elgin, from which a branch line extends to Lossiemouth. The Highland\r\nrailway traverses the western limits of the shire running almost due\r\nnorth to Forres, whence it turns westward to Nairn and eastward to\r\nElgin. From the county town it runs to Aberdeen via Orbliston and Keith,\r\nwith a branch to Fochabers from Orbliston.\r\n\r\n_Population and Government._--The population was 43,471 in 1891 and\r\n44,800 in 1901, when 1865 persons spoke both Gaelic and English, and 2\r\nspoke Gaelic only. The chief towns are Elgin (pop. in 1901, 8460),\r\nForres (4313) and Lossiemouth (3904), to which may be added Rothes\r\n(1621), Grantown (1568) and Burghead (1531). In conjunction with\r\nNairnshire the county returns one member to parliament. Elgin and Forres\r\nare royal burghs; the municipal and police burghs include Burghead,\r\nElgin, Forres, Grantown, Lossiemouth, and Rothes. Elginshire is included\r\nin one sheriffdom with Inverness and Nairn, and there is a resident\r\nsheriff-substitute at Elgin. The county is under school-board\r\njurisdiction, several of the schools earning grants for higher\r\neducation. There are academies at Elgin and Fochabers and science and\r\nart and technical schools at Elgin and Grantown. The bulk of the\r\n\"residue\" grant is spent in subsidizing the agricultural department of\r\nAberdeen University and the science schools and art and technical\r\nclasses in the county.\r\n\r\n_History._--Moray, in the wider sense, was first peopled by Picts of the\r\nGaelic branch of Celts, of whom relics are found in the stone circle at\r\nViewfield and at many places in Nairnshire. Christianity, introduced\r\nunder the auspices of Columba (from whose time the site of Burghead\r\nchurch has probably been so occupied), flourished for a period until the\r\nColumban church was expelled in 717 by King Nectan. Thereafter the\r\ndistrict was given over to internecine strife between the northern and\r\nsouthern Picts, which was ended by the crushing victory of Kenneth\r\nMacAlpine in 831, as one result of which the kingdom of Pictavia was\r\nsuperseded by the principality of Moravia. Still, settled order had not\r\nyet been secured, for the Norsemen raided the country first under\r\nThorstein and then under two Sigurds. It was in the time of the second\r\nSigurd that the Firth was fixed as the northern boundary of Moray. In\r\nspite of such interruptions as the battle of Torfness (Burghead) on the\r\n14th of August 1040, in which Thorfinn, earl of Orkney and Shetland,\r\noverthrew a strong force of Scots under King Duncan, the consolidation\r\nof the kingdom was being gradually accomplished. After Macbeth ascended\r\nthe throne the Scandinavians held their hands. Though Macbeth and his\r\n_faineant_ successor, \"daft\" Lulach, were the only kings whom Moray gave\r\nto Scotland, the province never lacked for able, if headstrong, men, and\r\nit continued to enjoy home rule under its own marmaer, or great steward\r\n(the equivalent of _earl_, the title that replaced it), until the dawn\r\nof the 12th century, when as an entity it ceased to exist. With a view\r\nto breaking up the power of the marmaers David I. and his successors\r\ncolonized the seaboard with settlers from other parts of the kingdom.\r\nNevertheless, from time to time the clansmen and their chiefs descended\r\nfrom their fastnesses and plundered the Laigh, keeping the people for\r\ngenerations in a state of panic. Meanwhile, the Church had become a\r\ncivilizing force. In 1107 Alexander had founded the see of Moray and the\r\nchurches of Birnie, Kinneddar and Spynie were in turn the cathedral of\r\nthe early bishops, until in 1224 under the episcopate of Andrew of Moray\r\n(de Moravia), the church of the Holy Trinity in Elgin was chosen for the\r\ncathedral. Another factor that drew men together was the struggle for\r\nindependence. In his effort to stamp out Scottish nationality Edward I.\r\ncame as far north as Elgin, where he stayed for four days in July 1296,\r\nand whence he issued his writ for the parliament at Berwick. Wallace,\r\nhowever, had no doughtier supporter than Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell,\r\nand Bruce recognized the assistance he had received from the men of the\r\nnorth by erecting Moray into an earldom on the morrow of Bannockburn and\r\nbestowing it upon Thomas Randolph (see MORAY, THOMAS RANDOLPH, EARL OF).\r\nHenceforward the history of the county resolved itself in the main into\r\nmatters affecting the power of the Church and the ambitions of the Moray\r\ndynasties. The Church accepted the Reformation peacefully if not with\r\ngratitude. But there was strife between Covenanters and the adherents of\r\nEpiscopacy until, prelacy itself being abolished in 1689, the bishopric\r\nof Moray came to an end after an existence of 581 years. (For the\r\nsubsequent history of the earldom, which was successively held by the\r\nRandolphs, the Dunbars, the Douglases, the royal Stewarts and an\r\nillegitimate branch of the Stewarts, see MURRAY or MORAY, EARLS OF.)\r\nOther celebrated Moray families who played a more or less strenuous part\r\nin local politics were the Gordons, the Grants and the Duffs. Still,\r\nnational affairs occasionally evoked interest in Moray. In the civil war\r\nMontrose ravaged the villages which stood for the Covenanters, but most\r\nof the great lairds shifted in their allegiance, and the mass of the\r\npeople were quite indifferent to the declining fortunes of the Stewarts.\r\nCharles II. landed at Garmouth on the 3rd of July 1650 on his return\r\nfrom his first exile in Holland, but hurried southwards to try the yoke\r\nof Presbytery. The fight at Cromdale (May day, 1690) shattered the\r\nJacobite cause, for the efforts in 1715 and 1745 were too spasmodic and\r\nhalf-hearted to affect the loyalty of the district to Hanoverian rule. A\r\nfew weeks before Culloden Prince Charles Edward stayed in Elgin for some\r\ndays, and a month afterwards the duke of Cumberland passed through the\r\ntown at the top of his speed and administered the _coup de grace_ to the\r\nYoung Pretender on Drummossie Moor.\r\n\r\nTwice Elginshire has been the scene of catastrophes without parallel in\r\nScotland. In 1694 the barony of Culbin--a fine estate, with a rent roll\r\nin money and kind of L6000 a year, belonging to the Kinnairds,\r\ncomprising 3600 acres of land, so fertile that it was called the Granary\r\nof Moray, a handsome mansion, a church and several houses--was buried\r\nunder a mass of sand in a storm of extraordinary severity. The sandy\r\nwaste measures 3 m. in length and 2 in breadth, and the sand,\r\nexceedingly fine and light, is constantly shifting and, at rare\r\nintervals, exposing traces of the vanished demesne. This wilderness of\r\ndome-shaped dunes divided by a loftier ridge lies to the north-west of\r\nForres. The other calamity was the Moray floods of the 2nd and 3rd of\r\nAugust 1829. The Findhorn rose 50 ft. above the ordinary level,\r\ninundating an area of 20 sq. m.; the Divie rose 40 ft., and the Lossie\r\nflooded all the low ground around Elgin. The floods tore down bridges\r\nand buildings, and obliterated farms and homesteads.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Lachlan Shaw, _History of the Province of Moray_\r\n  (Gordon's edition, Glasgow, 1882); _A Survey of the Province of Moray_\r\n  (Elgin, 1798); W.

N. and 34-1/2 deg. E., forming a vast isolated mass over\r\n40 m. in diameter. The outer slopes are in great measure precipitous on\r\nthe north, west and south, but fall more gradually to the east. The\r\nsouthern cliffs are remarkable for extensive caves, which have the\r\nappearance of water-worn caves on a coast line and have for ages served\r\nas habitations for the natives. The higher parts slope gradually upwards\r\nto the rim of an old crater, lying somewhat north of the centre of the\r\nmass, and measuring some 8 m. in diameter. The highest point of the rim\r\nis about 14,100 ft. above the sea. Steep spurs separated by narrow\r\nravines run out from the mountain, affording the most picturesque\r\nscenery. The ravines are traversed by a great number of streams, which\r\nflow north-west and west to the Nile (through Lake Choga), south and\r\nsouth-east to Victoria Nyanza, and north-east to Lake Rudolf by the\r\nTurkwell, the head-stream of which rises within the crater, breaking\r\nthrough a deep cleft in its rim. To the north-west of the mountain a\r\ngrassy plain, swampy in the rains, falls towards the chain of lakes\r\nending in Choga; towards the north-east the country becomes more arid,\r\nwhile towards the south it is well wooded. The outer slopes are clothed\r\nin their upper regions with dense forest formed in part of bamboos,\r\nespecially towards the south and west, in which directions the rainfall\r\nis greater than elsewhere. The lower slopes are exceptionally fertile on\r\nthe west, and produce bananas in abundance. On the north-west and north\r\nthe region between 6000 and 7000 ft. possesses a delightful climate, and\r\nis well watered by streams of ice-cold water. The district of Save on\r\nthe north is a halting-place for Arab and Swahili caravans going north.\r\nOn the west the slopes are densely inhabited by small Bantu-Negro\r\ntribes, who style their country Masawa (whence the alternative name for\r\nthe mountain); but on the south and north there are tribes which seem\r\nakin to the Gallas. Of these, the best known are the El-gonyi, from whom\r\nthe name Elgon has been derived. They formerly lived almost entirely in\r\nthe caves, but many of them have descended to villages at the foot of\r\nthe mountain. Elgon was first visited in 1883 by Joseph Thomson, who\r\nbrought to light the cave-dwellings on the southern face. It was crossed\r\nfrom north to south, and its crater reached, in 1890 by F.J. Jackson and\r\nErnest Gedge, while the first journey round it was made by C.W. Hobley\r\nin 1896.     (E. He.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELI (Hebrew for \"high\"? 1 Sam. chaps, i.-iv.), a member of the ancient\r\npriesthood founded in Egypt (1 Sam. ii. 27), priest of the temple of\r\nShiloh, the sanctuary of the ark, and also \"judge\" over Israel. This was\r\nan unusual combination of offices, when it is considered that in the\r\nhistory preserved to us he appears in the weakness of extreme old age,\r\nunable to control the petulance and rapacity of his sons, Hophni and\r\nPhinehas, who disgraced the sanctuary and disgusted the people. While\r\nthe central authority was thus weakened, the Philistines advanced\r\nagainst Israel, and gained a complete victory in the great battle of\r\nEbenezer, where the ark was taken, and Hophni and Phinehas slain. On\r\nhearing the news Eli fell from his seat and died. In a passage not\r\nunlike the account of the birth of Benjamin (Gen. xxxv. 16 sqq.), it is\r\nadded that the wife of Phinehas, overwhelmed at the loss of the ark and\r\nof her husband, died in child-birth, naming the babe Ichabod (1 Sam.\r\niv. 19 sqq.). This name, which popular etymology explained by the words\r\n\"the glory is removed (or, stronger, 'banished') from Israel\" (cf. Hos.\r\nx. 5), should perhaps be altered from _I-kabod_ (as though \"not glory\")\r\nto Jochebed (_Yokebed_, a slight change in the original), the name which\r\ntradition also gave to the mother of Moses (q.v.). After these events\r\nthe sanctuary of Shiloh appears to have been destroyed (cf. Jer. vii.\r\n12, xxvi. 6, 9), and the descendants of Eli with the whole of their clan\r\nor \"father's house\" subsequently appear as settled at Nob (1 Sam. xxi.\r\n1, xxii. 11 sqq., cp. xiv. 3), perhaps in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nJerusalem (Is. x. 32). In the massacre of the clan by Saul, and the\r\nsubsequent substitution of the survivor Abiathar by Zadok (1 Kings ii.\r\n27, 35), later writers saw the fulfilment of the prophecies of judgment\r\nwhich was said to have been uttered in the days of Eli against his\r\ncorrupt house (1 Sam. ii. 27 sqq., iii. 11 sqq.).[1]\r\n\r\n  See further, SAMUEL, BOOKS OF; and on Eli as a descendant of a Levite\r\n  clan (1 Sam. ii 27 sq.), see LEVITES (S 3).

C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] On the old views relating to the succession of the priests,\r\n    according to which the high-priesthood was diverted from the line of\r\n    Eleazar and Phinehas into that of Ithamar, see Robertson Smith, _Old\r\n    Test. in Jewish Church_, 2nd ed., p. 266.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIAS, of Cortona (c. 1180-1253), disciple of St Francis of Assisi, was\r\nborn near Assisi, about 1180, of the working class, but became\r\nschoolmaster at Assisi and then notary at Bologna. In 1217 he was the\r\nhead of the Franciscan mission to the Holy Land, and in 1219 St Francis\r\nmade him first provincial minister of Syria. When St Francis was\r\nrecalled from the East in 1220 he brought Elias with him. Elias played a\r\nleading part in the early history of the Franciscan order (see\r\nFRANCISCANS); Francis made him his vicar general in 1221; and he was the\r\npractical acting superior of the order till Francis' death in 1226, and\r\nthe real superior till the general chapter of 1227. This chapter did not\r\nelect him minister general, but that of 1232 did; at the chapter of 1239\r\nhe was deposed. During these years he erected the basilica and monastery\r\nat Assisi which were entirely his creation--he collected the funds and\r\ncarried the work through, being himself the builder and even the\r\narchitect. Elias was a man of extraordinary ability, the friend both of\r\nGregory IX. and of his opponent Frederick II. After his deposition Elias\r\njoined the party of the emperor and so incurred excommunication.\r\nFrederick sent him as ambassador to Constantinople. He dressed and lived\r\nas a Franciscan throughout and a small number of friars adhered to him;\r\nfor these he built a church and monastery at Cortona. Unavailing efforts\r\nwere made to bring about his reconciliation with the order and the\r\nChurch; at last on his death-bed he made his submission to the pope and\r\ndied in 1253, having received the Sacraments.\r\n\r\n  The best account of Elias is that by Ed. Lempp, _Frere Elie de\r\n  Cortone_ (1901), who points out the conflict of view, as to the\r\n  relations between Elias and Francis, between the _Speculum\r\n  perfectionis_ and the _First Life_, by Thomas of Celano; Lempp and\r\n  Sabatier accept the hostile picture given by the _Speculum\r\n  perfectionis_. But see further FRANCIS OF ASSISI, SAINT, \"Note on\r\n  Sources,\" and especially the articles by Goetz, there referred to, in\r\n  the _Hist. Vierteljahrsschrift._ There is a good article on Elias, but\r\n  written before the new materials had been produced, in Wetzer und\r\n  Welte, _Kirchenlexicon_ (ed. 2).     (E. C. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIAS, JOHN (1774-1841), Welsh Nonconformist preacher and reformer, was\r\nborn on the 2nd of May 1774, in the parish of Abererch, Carnarvonshire.\r\nIn his youth he came under the influence of the Calvinistic Methodist\r\nrevival and became a preacher at nineteen. In 1799 he married and\r\nsettled at Llanfechell in Anglesey, giving up his trade as a weaver to\r\nbecome a small shopkeeper. His fame as a preacher increased, and under\r\nthe direction of Thomas Charles of Bala he established numerous Sunday\r\nschools, and gave and secured considerable Welsh support to the founding\r\nof the London Missionary Society, the British and Foreign Bible Society\r\nand the Religious Tract Society. On Charles's death in 1814 he became\r\nthe recognized leader of the Calvinistic Methodist Church, and the story\r\nof his life is simply a record of marvellously successful preaching\r\ntours. He died on the 8th of June 1841; ten thousand people attended his\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nHis eloquence was so remarkable that he was known as \"the Welsh\r\nDemosthenes.\" His strength lay in his intense conviction of an intimate\r\nconnexion between sin and punishment and in his power of dramatic\r\npresentation. As an ecclesiastic he was not so successful; he helped to\r\ncompile his church's Confession of Faith in 1823, and laid great stress\r\non a clause which limited the scope of the atonement to the elect. He\r\nwas a stout Tory in politics and had many friends among the Anglican\r\nclergy; he opposed the movement for Roman Catholic emancipation. Several\r\nof his sermons were published in Welsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIAS LEVITA (1469-1549), Jewish grammarian, was born at Neustadt on the\r\nAisch, a place in Bavaria lying between Nuremberg and Wurzburg. He\r\npreferred to call himself \"Ashkenazi,\" the German, and bore also the\r\nnickname of \"Bachur,\" the youth or student, which latter he gave as\r\ntitle to his Hebrew grammar. Before the end of the 15th century he went\r\nto Italy, which thenceforth remained his home. He lived first at Padua,\r\nwent in 1509, after the capture of this town by the army of the League\r\nof Cambrai, to Venice, and finally in 1513 to Rome, where he found a\r\npatron in the learned general of the Augustinian Order, the future\r\ncardinal Egidio di Viterbo, whom he helped in his study of the Kabbalah,\r\nwhile he himself was inspired by him to literary work. The storming of\r\nRome by the army of the Constable de Bourbon in 1527 compelled Elias to\r\ngo to Venice, where he was employed as corrector in the printing-house\r\nof Daniel Bomberg. In the years 1541 and 1542 he lived at Isny, in\r\nSouthern Wurttemberg, where he published several of his writings in the\r\nprinting-house of the learned pastor Paul Fagius. The last years of his\r\nlife he spent at Venice, continuously active in spite of ill-health and\r\nthe weakness of old age. His monument in the graveyard of the Jewish\r\ncommunity at Venice boasts of him that \"he illuminated the darkness of\r\ngrammar and turned it into light.\" The importance of Levita rests both\r\nin his numerous writings and in his personal activity. In the remarkable\r\nperiod which saw the rise of the Reformation and gave to the study of\r\nthe Hebrew Bible and to its language an importance in the history of the\r\nworld, it was Levita who furthered in an extraordinary manner the study\r\nof Hebrew in Christian circles by his activity as a teacher and by his\r\nwritings. To his pupils especially belong Sebastian Minoter, who\r\ntranslated Levita's grammatical works into Latin, also George de Selve,\r\nbishop of Lavaur, the French ambassador in Venice (1536), who was\r\ninstrumental in obtaining for Levita an invitation from Francis I. to\r\ncome to Paris, which invitation, however, Levita did not accept.\r\nLevita's writings on Hebrew grammar (_Bachur_, a text-book, 1518;\r\n_Harkaba_, an explanation, alphabetically arranged, of irregular\r\nword-forms; a Table of Paradigms; _Pirke Elijahu_, a description--partly\r\nmetrical--of phonetics, and other chapters of the grammar, 1520; his\r\nearliest work, a Commentary on Moses Kimhi's Hebrew Grammar, 1508) were\r\nby reason of their methodical exposition, their clear articulation,\r\ntheir avoidance of prolixity, especially suited as an introduction to\r\nthe study of the Hebrew language. Amongst Levita's other writings is the\r\nfirst dictionary of the Targumim (_Meturgeman_, 1541) and the first\r\nattempt at a lexicon in which much of the treasure of late Hebrew\r\nlanguage was explained (_Tishbi_, explanation of 712 new Hebrew\r\nvocables, as a supplement to the dictionaries of David Kimhi and Nathan\r\nb. Yehiel, 1542). Scientifically most valuable, and of original\r\nimportance, are the works of Levita on the _Massora_; his Concordance to\r\nthe Massora (_Sefer Zikhronot_ completed in the second revision 1536),\r\nof which hitherto only a small part has been published, and especially\r\nhis most celebrated book _Massoreth Hamasoreth_ (1538), published with\r\nEnglish translation by Chr. D. Ginsburg, London, 1867. This was the\r\nfirst attempt to give a systematic account of the contents and history\r\nof the Massora. By his criticism of the Massora, and especially by\r\nproving that the punctuation of the books of the Hebrew Bible is of late\r\norigin, Levita exercised an epoch-making influence. Of his other\r\nwritings may be mentioned his running commentary on David Kimhi's\r\nGrammar and Dictionary (in the Bomberg editions 1545, 1546), his German\r\ntranslation of the Psalms (1545) and the _Baba-Buch_ (more properly\r\n_Buovobuch_, a German recension of the Italian novel _Historia di Buovo\r\nd' Antona_, 1508).\r\n\r\n  Of the literature on Levita may be mentioned: Y. Levi, _Elia Levita\r\n  und seine Leistungen als Grammatiker_ (Breslau, 1888); W. Bacher, \"E.\r\n  Levita's wissenschaftliche Leistungen\" in _Z. d. D. M. G._ xliii.\r\n  (1889), p. 206-272.     (W. Ba.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIE, a village and watering-place of Fifeshire, Scotland, on the shore\r\nof the Firth of Forth. Pop. 687. It is 10 m. due S. of St Andrews, but\r\n20 m. distant by the North British railway, which makes a great bend by\r\nfollowing the coast. Though it retains some old houses, and the parish\r\nchurch dates from 1639, Elie is, as a whole, quite modern and is one of\r\nthe most popular resorts in the county on account of its fine golf links\r\nand excellent bathing. The royal burgh of Earlsferry (pop. 317) is\r\nsituated in the parish of Elie, which it adjoins on the west. Its\r\ncharter, granted by Malcolm Canmore, having been burned, it was renewed\r\nby James VI. The chief structure is the town hall, which is modern but\r\nhas an ancient steeple. The place derived its name from its use by the\r\nearls of Fife as a ferry to the opposite shore of Haddington, 8 m.\r\ndistant. Macduff's cave near Kincraig Point is believed traditionally to\r\nhave been that in which the thane took refuge from Macbeth. Two and a\r\nhalf miles north is Balcarres House, belonging to the earl of Crawford,\r\nwhere Lady Anne Barnard (1750-1825) was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIE DE BEAUMONT, JEAN BAPTISTE ARMAND LOUIS LEONCE (1798-1874), French\r\ngeologist, was born at Canon, in Calvados, on the 25th of September\r\n1798. He was educated at the Lycee Henri IV. where he took the first\r\nprize in mathematics and physics; at the Ecole Polytechnique, where he\r\nstood first at the exit examination in 1819; and at the Ecole des Mines\r\n(1819-1822), where he began to show a decided preference for the science\r\nwith which his name is associated. In 1823 he was selected along with\r\nDufrenoy by Brochant de Villiers, the professor of geology in the Ecole\r\ndes Mines, to accompany him on a scientific tour to England and\r\nScotland, in order to inspect the mining and metallurgical\r\nestablishments of the country, and to study the principles on which\r\nGreenough's geological map of England (1820) had been prepared, with a\r\nview to the construction of a similar map of France. In 1835 he was\r\nappointed professor of geology at the Ecole des Mines, in succession to\r\nBrochant de Villiers, whose assistant he had been in the duties of the\r\nchair since 1827. He held the office of engineer-in-chief of mines in\r\nFrance from 1833 until 1847, when he was appointed inspector-general;\r\nand in 1861 he became vice-president of the Conseil-General des Mines\r\nand a grand officer of the Legion of Honour. His growing scientific\r\nreputation secured his election to the membership of the Academy of\r\nBerlin, of the Academy of Sciences of France and of the Royal Society of\r\nLondon. By a decree of the president he was made a senator of France in\r\n1852, and on the death of Arago (1853) he was chosen perpetual secretary\r\nof the Academy of Sciences. Elie de Beaumont's name is widely known to\r\ngeologists in connexion with his theory of the origin of mountain\r\nranges, first propounded in a paper read to the Academy of Sciences in\r\n1829, and afterwards elaborated in his _Notice sur le systeme des\r\nmontagnes_ (3 vols., 1852). According to his view, all mountain ranges\r\nparallel to the same great circle of the earth are of strictly\r\ncontemporaneous origin, and between the great circles a relation of\r\nsymmetry exists in the form of a pentagonal _reseau_. An elaborate\r\nstatement and criticism of the theory was given in his anniversary\r\naddress to the Geological Society of London in 1853 by William Hopkins\r\n(_Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc_.). The theory has not found general\r\nacceptance, but it proved of great value to geological science, owing to\r\nthe extensive additions to the knowledge of the structure of mountain\r\nranges which its author made in endeavouring to find facts to support\r\nit. Probably, however, the best service Elie de Beaumont rendered to\r\nscience was in connexion with the geological map of France, in the\r\npreparation of which he had the leading share. During this period Elie\r\nde Beaumont published many important memoirs on the geology of the\r\ncountry. After his superannuation at the Ecole des Mines he continued to\r\nsuperintend the issue of the detailed maps almost until his death,\r\nwhich occurred at Canon on the 21st of September 1874. His academic\r\nlectures for 1843-1844 were published in 2 vols., 1845-1849, under the\r\ntitle _Lecons de geologie pratique_.\r\n\r\n  A list of his works was published in the _Ann. des Mines_, vol. vii.\r\n  1875. P. 259.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIJAH (a Hebrew name meaning \"Yah[weh] is God\"), in the Bible, the\r\ngreatest and sternest of the Hebrew prophets, makes his appearance in\r\nthe narrative of the Old Testament with an abruptness not out of keeping\r\nwith his character and work (1 Kings xvii. 1).[1] The first and most\r\nimportant part of his career lay in the reign of Ahab, i.e. during the\r\nfirst half of the 9th century B.C. He is introduced as predicting the\r\ndrought[2] God was to send upon Israel as a punishment for the apostasy\r\ninto which Ahab had been led by his heathen wife Jezebel. During the\r\nfirst portion of this period Elijah found a refuge by the brook Cherith,\r\n\"before the Jordan.\" This description leaves it uncertain whether the\r\nbrook was to the east of Jordan in Elijah's native Gilead, or--less\r\nprobably--to the west in Samaria. Here he drank of the brook and was fed\r\nby ravens, who night and morning brought him bread and flesh.[3] When\r\nthis had dried up, the prophet betook himself to Zarephath, a Phoenician\r\ntown near Sidon. At the gate of the town he met the widow to whom he had\r\nbeen sent, gathering sticks for the preparation of what she believed was\r\nto be her last meal. She received the prophet with hospitality, sharing\r\nwith him her all but exhausted store, in faith of his promise in the\r\nname of the God of Israel that the supply would not fail so long as the\r\ndrought lasted. During this period her son died and was miraculously\r\nrestored to life in answer to the prayers of the prophet (1 Kings xvii.\r\n8-24).\r\n\r\nElijah emerged from his retirement in the third year, when, the famine\r\nhaving reached its worst, Ahab and his minister Obadiah had themselves\r\nto search the land for provender for the royal stables. To the latter\r\nElijah suddenly appeared, and announced his intention of showing himself\r\nto Ahab. The king met Elijah with the reproach that he was \"the troubler\r\nof Israel,\" which the prophet boldly flung back upon him who had\r\nforsaken the commandments of the Lord and followed the Baalim.[4] The\r\nretort was accompanied by a challenge--or rather a command--to the king\r\nto assemble on Mount Carmel \"all Israel\" and the four hundred and fifty\r\nprophets of Baal. (The four hundred prophets of Asherah have been added\r\nlater.) From the allusion to an \"altar of Jehovah that was broken down\"\r\n(1 Kings xviii. 30) it has been inferred that Carmel was an ancient\r\nsacred place. (On Mount Carmel and Elijah's connexion with it in history\r\nand tradition see CARMEL.)\r\n\r\nThe scene on Carmel is perhaps the grandest in the life of Elijah, or\r\nindeed in the whole of the Old Testament. As a typical embodiment for\r\nall time of the conflict between superstition and true religion, it is\r\nlifted out of the range of mere individual biography into that of\r\nspiritual symbolism, and it has accordingly furnished at once a fruitful\r\ntheme for the religious teacher and a lofty inspiration for the artist.\r\nThe false prophets were allowed to invoke their god in whatever manner\r\nthey pleased. The only interruption came in the mocking encouragement of\r\nElijah (1 Kings xviii. 27), a rare instance of grim sarcastic humour\r\noccurring in the Bible. Its effect upon the false prophets was to\r\nincrease their frenzy. The evening came,[5] and the god had made no\r\nsign. Elijah now stepped forward with the quiet confidence and dignity\r\nthat became the prophet and representative of the true God. All Israel\r\nis represented symbolically in the twelve stones with which he built the\r\naltar; and the water which he poured upon the sacrifice and into the\r\nsurrounding trench was apparently designed to prevent the suspicion of\r\nfraud! In striking contrast to the \"vain repetitions\" of the false\r\nprophets are the simple words with which Elijah makes his prayer to\r\nYahweh. Once only, with the calm assurance of one who knew that his\r\nprayer would be answered, he invokes the God of his fathers. The answer\r\ncomes at once: \"The fire of the Lord (Gen. xix. 24, Lev. x. 2) fell and\r\nconsumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust,\r\nand licked up the water that was in the trench.\" So convincing a sign\r\nwas irresistible; all the people fell on their faces and acknowledged\r\nYahweh as the true God. This was immediately followed by the destruction\r\nof the false prophets, slain by Elijah beside the brook Kishon (xviii.\r\n40). The deed, though not without parallel in the Old Testament history,\r\nstamps the peculiarly vindictive character of Elijah's prophetic\r\nmission.[6]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day that had witnessed the decisive contest,\r\nElijah proceeded once more to the top of Carmel, and there, with \"his\r\nface between his knees\" (possibly engaged in the prayer referred to in\r\nJames v. 17 sq.), waited for the long-looked-for blessing. His servant,\r\nsent repeatedly to search the sky for signs, returned the seventh time\r\nreporting a little cloud arising out of the sea \"like a man's hand.\" The\r\nsky was speedily full of clouds and a great rain was falling when Ahab,\r\nto escape the storm, set out in his chariot for Jezreel. As a proof of\r\nElijah's supernatural power, it is stated that the prophet, for some\r\nunknown object, ran before the chariot to the entrance of Jezreel, a\r\ndistance of at least 16 m. On being told what had taken place, Jezebel\r\nsent a messenger to Elijah with a vow that ere another day had passed\r\nhis life would be even as the lives of the prophets of Baal, and the\r\nthreat was enough to cause him to take to instant flight (xix. 1-3; cp.\r\nLXX. in v. 2). The first stage of the journey was to Beersheba, on the\r\nsouthern limits of Judah. Here he left his servant (according to old\r\nJewish tradition, the widow's son of Zarephath, afterwards the prophet\r\nJonah), and proceeded a day's journey into the wilderness. Resting under\r\na solitary broom bush (a kind of _genista_), he gave vent to his\r\ndisappointment in a prayer for death. By another of those many\r\nmiraculous interpositions which occur in his history he was twice\r\nsupplied with food and drink, in the strength of which he journeyed\r\nforty days and forty nights until he came to Horeb, where he lodged in a\r\ncave.[7] A hole \"just large enough for a man's body\" (Stanley),\r\nimmediately below the summit of Jebel Musa, is still pointed out by\r\ntradition as the cave of Elijah.\r\n\r\nIf the scene on Carmel is the grandest, that on Horeb is spiritually the\r\nmost profound in the story of Elijah (xix. 9 sqq.). Not in the strong\r\nwind that brake the rocks in pieces, not in the earthquake, not in the\r\nfire, but in the still small voice that followed the Lord made himself\r\nknown. A threefold commission was laid upon him: he was to return to\r\nDamascus and anoint Hazael king of Syria; he was to anoint Jehu, the son\r\nof Nimshi, as king of Israel in place of Ahab; and as his own successor\r\nin the prophetic office he was to anoint Elisha (xix. 15-18).[8]\r\n\r\nLeaving Horeb and proceeding northwards along the desert route to\r\nDamascus, Elijah met Elisha engaged at the plough probably near his\r\nnative place, Abel-meholah, in the valley of the Jordan, and by the\r\nsymbolical act of casting his mantle upon him, consecrated him to the\r\nprophetic office. This was the only command of the three which he\r\nfulfilled in person; the other two were carried out by his successor.[9]\r\nAfter the call of Elisha the narrative contains no notice of Elijah for\r\nseveral years, although the LXX., by placing 1 Kings xxi. before ch.\r\nxx., proceeds at once to the tragic story of Naboth's vineyard (see\r\nJEZEBEL). He is now the champion of freedom and purity of life, like\r\nNathan when he confronted David for the murder of Uriah. Without any\r\nindication of whence or how he came, he again appeared, as usual with\r\nstartling abruptness, in the vineyard when Ahab entered to take\r\npossession of it, and pronounced upon the king and his house that awful\r\ndoom (1 Kings xxi. 17-24) which, though deferred for a time, was\r\nultimately fulfilled to the letter (see JEHU).\r\n\r\nWith one more denunciation of the house of Ahab, Elijah's function as a\r\nmessenger of wrath was fully discharged (2 Kings i.). When Ahaziah, the\r\nson of Ahab, having injured himself by falling through a lattice, sent\r\nto inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether he should recover,\r\nthe prophet was commanded to appear to the messengers and tell them\r\nthat, for this resort to a false god, the king should die. The effect of\r\nhis appearance was such that they turned back without attempting to\r\nfulfil their errand. Ahaziah despatched a captain with a band of fifty\r\nto arrest him. They came upon Elijah seated on \"the mount,\"--probably\r\nCarmel. The imperious terms in which he was summoned to come down were\r\npunished by fire from heaven, which descended at the bidding of Elijah\r\nand consumed the whole land. A second captain and fifty were despatched,\r\nbehaved in a similar way, and met the same fate. The leader of a third\r\ntroop took a humbler tone, sued for mercy, and obtained it. Elijah then\r\nwent with them to the king, but only to repeat before his face the doom\r\nhe had already made known to his messengers, which was almost\r\nimmediately afterwards fulfilled. The spirit, even the style of this\r\nnarrative, points unmistakably to its being of late origin. It shocks\r\nthe moral sense with its sanguinary character more than, perhaps, any\r\nother Old Testament story.\r\n\r\nThe only mention of Elijah's name in the book of Chronicles (2\r\nChronicles xxi. 12-15) is where he is represented as sending a letter of\r\nrebuke and denunciation to Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.\r\nThe chronological difficulties which are involved suggest that the\r\nfloating traditions of this great personality were easily attached to\r\nwell-known names whether strictly contemporary or not. It was before the\r\ndeath of Jehoshaphat that the last grand scene in Elijah's life occurred\r\n(2 Kings ii., see iii. 1). He had taken up his residence with Elisha at\r\none of the prophetic guilds at Gilgal. His approaching end seems to have\r\nbeen known to the guilds at Bethel and Jericho, both of which they\r\nvisited in their last journey. At the Jordan, Elijah, wrapping his\r\nprophet's mantle together, smote the water with it, and so by a last\r\nmiracle passed over on dry ground. When they had crossed the master\r\ndesired the disciple to ask some parting blessing. The request for a\r\ndouble portion (i.e. probably a first-born's portion, Deut. xxi.\r\n17)[10] of the prophet's spirit Elijah characterized as a hard thing;\r\nbut he promised to grant it if Elisha should see him when he was taken\r\naway. The end is told in words of simple sublimity: \"And it came to\r\npass, as they still went on and talked, that, behold, there appeared a\r\nchariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder; and\r\nElijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven\" (2 Kings ii. 11). It is\r\nscarcely necessary to point out, however, that through the figure the\r\nnarrative evidently means to convey as fact that Elijah passed from\r\nearth, not by the gates of death, but by miraculous translation. Such a\r\nsupernatural close is in perfect harmony with a career into every stage\r\nof which the supernatural enters as an essential feature. For whatever\r\nexplanation may be offered of the miraculous element in Elijah's life,\r\nit must obviously be one that accounts not for a few miraculous\r\nincidents only, which might be mere excrescences, but for a series of\r\nmiraculous events so closely connected and so continuous as to form the\r\nmain thread of the history.\r\n\r\n  Elijah occupied an altogether peculiar place in later Jewish history\r\n  and tradition. For the general belief that he should return for the\r\n  restoration of Israel cf. Mal. iv. 5-6; Matt. xi. 14, xvi. 14; Luke\r\n  ix. 8; John i. 21, and on the development of the thought see Bousset,\r\n  _Antichrist_, s.v., and the _Jewish Encyc_. vol. v. p. 126. In\r\n  Mahommedan tradition Elijah is the everlasting youthful el-Khidr or\r\n  el-Khadir.\r\n\r\n  Elijah is canonized both in the Greek and in the Latin Churches, his\r\n  festival being kept in both on the 20th July--the date of his\r\n  ascension in the nineteenth year of Jehoshaphat, according to\r\n  Cornelius a Lapide. The natural and most reliable estimate of the\r\n  career of Elijah is that which is based upon a critical examination of\r\n  the narratives; see, in addition to Robertson Smith, _Prophets of\r\n  Israel_(^2), pp. 75 sqq., Cheyne, _Hallowing of Criticism_, the\r\n  articles by Addis in _Encyc. Bib_., and J. Strachan, Hastings' _Dict.\r\n  Bib_., H. Gunkel, _Elias, Yahve u. Baal_ (Tubingen, 1906), the\r\n  literature to KINGS, BOOKS OF, and the histories referred to in JEWS.\r\n  There is difference of opinion as to the historical importance of both\r\n  Elijah and Elisha; for a useful summary of views, as also for fuller\r\n  bibliographical information, see W.R. Harper, _Amos and Hosea_\r\n  (_Internat. Crit. Comm._), pp. xxxiv.-xlix., and article HEBREW\r\n  RELIGION.     (W. R. S.; S. A. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] The text is uncertain. According to the LXX., he was a native of\r\n    Tishbeh in Gilead; a more natural reading. Klostermann's conjecture\r\n    that the original name of his home was Jabesh-Gilead is attractive\r\n    but unnecessary. His appearance in the narrative, like Melchizedek,\r\n    \"without father, without mother\" (Heb. vii. 3), gave rise to various\r\n    rabbinical traditions, such as that he was Phinehas, the grandson of\r\n    Aaron, returned to earth, or that he was an angel in human form.\r\n\r\n  [2] Its duration is vaguely stated; from Luke iv. 25, James v. 17, we\r\n    learn that it lasted three years and a half; but according to\r\n    Phoenician tradition (Jos. _Ant_. viii. 13. 2) only one year.\r\n\r\n  [3] The rationalistic view that the word translated \"ravens\" should\r\n    be \"Arabians\" is improbable. Cheyne's suggestion that the unknown\r\n    brook Cherith should be placed to the south of Judah agrees with\r\n    Josephus (_Ant_. viii. 13. 2, \"he departed into the southern parts\")\r\n    and with 1 Kings xix. 3, 8; \"Jordan\" may refer to another river, if\r\n    it be not a gloss; see Cheyne, _Ency. Bib_., s.v. \"Cherith.\"\r\n\r\n  [4] The sudden introduction of Elijah in xvii. 1 may be accounted for\r\n    by the supposition that the commencement of the narrative had been\r\n    omitted by the editor of xvi. 29 sqq. Hence we are not told the cause\r\n    of Ahab's hostility towards Elijah, nor is the allusion to Jezebel's\r\n    massacre of the prophets (xviii. 3, 13) explained. It would appear\r\n    from Obadiah's words in ver. 9 that he himself was in fear of his\r\n    life. Later tradition supposed he was the captain of 2 Kings i. 13,\r\n    or that the widow of 2 Kings iv. 1 had been his wife.\r\n\r\n  [5] The definition of time by the stated oblation (xviii. 29, 36) is\r\n    very noteworthy (cp. 2 Kings iii. 20).\r\n\r\n  [6] It is obvious that a purely rationalistic interpretation of the\r\n    great sign whereby Jahweh manifested himself would be out of place.\r\n    But there is an interesting parallel in the legend of the kindling of\r\n    the sacred fire and the igniting of the \"thick water\" in the time of\r\n    Nehemiah (2 Macc. i. 18-36). Elsewhere, there were sacred fires\r\n    kindled by the aid of magical invocations (e.g. Hypaepa, Pausanias v.\r\n    27. 3).\r\n\r\n  [7] Yahweh is here supposed to have his seat on the ancient mountain.\r\n    \"It was the God of the Exodus to whom he appealed, the ancient King\r\n    of Israel in the journeyings through the wilderness.\" For the cave,\r\n    cp. Ex. xxxiii. 22.\r\n\r\n  [8] The theophany is clearly no rebuke to an impatient prophet, nor a\r\n    lesson that the kingdom of heaven was to be built up by the slow and\r\n    gentle operation of spiritual forces. It expresses the spirituality\r\n    of Yahweh in a way that indicates a marked advance in the conception\r\n    of his nature. See Skinner, _Century Bible_, \"Kings,\" _ad loc_.\r\n\r\n  [9] The geographical indications imply that in one account the\r\n    journey to Damascus and the anointing of Hazael and Jehu must have\r\n    intervened, and were omitted because another account ascribed these\r\n    acts to Elisha (2 Kings viii. ix.). In the latter we possess a more\r\n    historical account of the anointing of Jehu, and Robertson Smith\r\n    observes: \"When the history in 1 Kings represents Elijah as\r\n    personally commissioned to inaugurate [the revolution] by anointing\r\n    Jehu and Hazael as well as Elisha, we see that the author's design is\r\n    to gather up the whole contest between Yahweh and Baal in an ideal\r\n    picture of Elijah and his work\" (_Ency. Brit_. (9) art. Kings, vol.\r\n    xiv. p. 85).\r\n\r\n  [10] Understood in Eccles. xlviii. 12 (Heb.) to mean that Elisha was\r\n    _twice as great_ as Elijah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIJAH WILNA, or ELIJAH BEN SOLOMON, best known as the GAON ELIJAH OF\r\nWILNA (1720-1797), a noted Talmudist who hovered between the new and the\r\nold schools of thought. Orthodox in practice and feeling, his critical\r\ntreatment of the rabbinic literature prepared the way for the scientific\r\ninvestigations of the 19th century. As a teacher he was one of the first\r\nto discriminate between the various strata in rabbinic records; to him\r\nwas due the revival of interest in the older Midrash (q.v.) and in the\r\nPalestinian Talmud (q.v.), interest in which had been weak for some\r\ncenturies before his time. He was an ascetic, and was a keen opponent of\r\nthe emotional mysticism which was known as the new Hassidism.\r\n\r\n  See S. Schechter's _Studies in Judaism_ (London, 1896). His voluminous\r\n  writings are classified in the _Jewish Encyclopedia_, v. 134.\r\n       (I. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIOT, CHARLES WILLIAM (1834-   ), American educationalist, the son of\r\nSamuel Atkins Eliot (1798-1862), mayor of Boston, representative in\r\nCongress, and in 1842-1853 treasurer of Harvard, was born in Boston on\r\nthe 20th of March 1834. He graduated in 1853 at Harvard College, where\r\nhe was successively tutor (1854-1858) and assistant professor of\r\nchemistry (1858-1863). He studied chemistry and foreign educational\r\nmethods in Europe in 1863-1865, was professor of analytical chemistry in\r\nthe newly established Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1865-1869),\r\nalthough absent fourteen months in Europe in 1867-1868; and in 1869 was\r\nelected president of Harvard University, a choice remarkable at once for\r\nhis youth and his being a layman and scientist. With Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity, Harvard, in his presidency, led in the work of efficient\r\ngraduate schools. Its elective system, which has spread far, although\r\nnot originated by President Eliot, was thoroughly established by him,\r\nand is only one of many radical changes which he championed with great\r\nsuccess. The raising of entrance requirements, which led to a\r\ncorresponding raising of the standards of secondary schools, and the\r\nintroduction of an element of choice in these entrance requirements,\r\nwhich allowed a limited election of studies to secondary pupils, became\r\nnational tendencies primarily through President Eliot's potent\r\ninfluence. As chairman of a national Committee of Ten (1890) on\r\nsecondary school studies, he urged the abandonment of brief disconnected\r\n\"information\" courses, the correlation of subjects taught, the equal\r\nrank in college requirements of subjects in which equal time,\r\nconsecutiveness and concentration were demanded, and a more thorough\r\nstudy of English composition; and to a large degree he secured national\r\nsanction for these reforms and their working out by experts into a\r\npracticable and applicable system. He laboured to unify the entire\r\neducational system, minimize prescription, cast out monotony, and\r\nintroduce freedom and enthusiasm; and he emphasized the need of special\r\ntraining for special work. He was first to suggest (1894) co-operation\r\nby colleges in holding common entrance examinations throughout the\r\ncountry, and it was largely through his efforts that standards were so\r\napproximated that this became possible. He contended that secondary\r\nschools maintained by public funds should shape their courses for the\r\nbenefit of students whose education goes no further than such high\r\nschools, and not be mere training schools for the universities. His\r\nsuccess as administrator and man of affairs and as an educational\r\nreformer made him one of the great figures of his time, in whose\r\nopinions on any topic the deepest interest was felt throughout the\r\ncountry. In November 1908 he resigned the presidency of Harvard, and\r\nretired from the position early in 1909, when he was succeeded by\r\nProfessor Abbott Lawrence Lowell. In December 1908 he was elected\r\npresident of the National Civil Service Reform League.\r\n\r\nHis writings include _The Happy Life_ (1896); _Five American\r\nContributions to Civilization, and Other Essays and Addresses_ (1897);\r\n_Educational Reform, Essays and Addresses 1869-1897_ (1898); _More Money\r\nfor the Public Schools_ (1903); _Four American Leaders_ (1906), chapters\r\non Franklin, Washington, Channing and Emerson; _University\r\nAdministration_ (1908); and with F.H. Storer, a _Compendious Manual of\r\nQualitative Chemical Analysis_ (Boston, 1869; many times reissued and\r\nrevised). His annual reports as President of Harvard were notable\r\ncontributions to the literature of education in America, and he\r\ndelivered numerous public addresses, many of which have been reprinted.\r\n\r\n  See \"President Eliot's Administration,\" by different hands, a summary\r\n  of his work at Harvard in 1869-1894, in _The Harvard Graduates'\r\n  Magazine_, vol. 2, pp. 449-504 (Boston, Mass., 1894); and E.\r\n  Kuhnemann, _Charles W. Eliot, President of Harvard_ (Boston, 1909).\r\n\r\nHis son, CHARLES ELIOT (1859-1897), graduated at Harvard in 1882,\r\nstudied landscape architecture at the Bussey Institution of Harvard and\r\nin Europe, successfully urged the incorporation of the Massachusetts\r\nTrustees of Public Reservations (1891) and of the Metropolitan Park\r\nCommission (1892) of Boston, became landscape architect to the\r\nMetropolitan Park Commission in 1892, and in 1893, with F.L. Olmsted and\r\nJ.C. Olmsted, formed the firm of Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot, which was\r\nemployed by the Metropolitan Commission. His life was written by his\r\nfather, _Charles Eliot, Landscape Architect_ (Boston, 1902).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIOT, GEORGE, the pen-name of the famous English writer, _nee_ Mary Ann\r\n(or Marian) Evans (1819-1880), afterwards Mrs J.W. Cross, born at Arbury\r\nFarm, in Warwickshire, on the 22nd of November 1819. Her father, Robert\r\nEvans, was the agent of Mr Francis Newdigate, and the first twenty-one\r\nyears of the great novelist's life were spent on the Arbury estate. She\r\nreceived an ordinary education at respectable schools till the age of\r\nseventeen, when her mother's death, and the marriage of her elder\r\nsister, called her home in the character of housekeeper. This, though it\r\nmust have sharpened her sense, already too acute, of responsibility, was\r\nan immense advantage to her mind, and, later, to her career, for,\r\ndelivered from the tiresome routine of lessons and class-work, she was\r\nable to work without pedantic interruptions at German, Italian and\r\nmusic, and to follow her unusually good taste in reading. The life,\r\ninasmuch as she was a girl still in her teens, was no doubt monotonous,\r\neven unhappy. Just as Cardinal Newman felt, with such different results,\r\nthe sadness and chain of evangelical influences from his boyhood till\r\nthe end of his days, so Marian Evans was subdued all through her youth\r\nby a severe religious training which, while it pinched her mind and\r\ncrushed her spirit, attracted her idealism by the very hardness of its\r\nperfect counsels. It is not surprising to find, therefore, that when Mr\r\nEvans moved to Coventry in 1841, and so enlarged the circle of their\r\nacquaintance, she became much interested in some new friends, Mr and Mrs\r\nCharles Bray and Mr Charles Hennell. Mr Bray had literary taste and\r\nwrote works on the _Education of the Feelings_, the _Philosophy of\r\nNecessity_, and the like. Mr Hennell had published in 1838 _An Enquiry\r\nconcerning the Origin of Christianity_. Miss Evans, then twenty-two,\r\nabsorbed immediately these unexpected, and, at that time, daring habits\r\nof thought. So compelling was the atmosphere that it led to a complete\r\nchange in her opinions. Kind in her affection, she was relentless in\r\nargument. She refused to go to church (for some time, at least), wrote\r\npainful letters to a former governess--the pious Miss Lewis--and barely\r\navoided an irremediable quarrel with her father, a churchman of the old\r\nschool. Here was rebellion indeed. But rebels come, for the most part,\r\nfrom the provinces where petty tyranny, exercised by small souls, show\r\nthe scheme of the universe on the meanest possible scale. George Eliot\r\nwas never orthodox again; she abandoned, with fierce determination,\r\nevery creed, and although she passed, later, through various phases, she\r\nremained incessantly a rationalist in matters of faith and in all other\r\nmatters. It is nevertheless true that she wrote admirably about religion\r\nand religious persons. She had learnt the evangelical point of view; she\r\nknew--none better--the strength of religious motives; vulgar doubts of\r\nthis fact were as distasteful to her as they were to another eminent\r\nwriter, to whom she refers in one of her letters (dated 1853) as \"a Mr\r\nHuxley, who was the centre of interest\" at some \"agreeable evening.\" Her\r\nbooks abound in tributes to Christian virtue, and one of her own\r\nfavourite characters was Dinah Morris in _Adam Bede_.\r\n\r\nShe undertook, about the beginning of 1844, the translation of Strauss's\r\n_Leben Jesu_. This work, published in 1846, was considered scholarly,\r\nbut it met, in the nature of things, with no popular success. On the\r\ndeath of Mr Evans in 1849, she went abroad for some time, and we hear of\r\nno more literary ventures till 1851, when she accepted the\r\nassistant-editorship of the _Westminster Review_. For a while she had\r\nlodgings at the offices of that publication in the Strand, London. She\r\nwrote several notable papers, and became acquainted with many\r\ndistinguished authors of that period--among them Herbert Spencer,\r\nCarlyle, Harriet Martineau, Francis Newman and George Henry Lewes. Her\r\nfriendship with the last-named led to a closer relationship which she\r\nregarded as a marriage. Among the many criticisms passed upon this step\r\n(in view of the fact, among other considerations, that Lewes had a wife\r\nliving at the time), no one has denied her courage in defying the law,\r\nor questioned the quality of her tact in a singularly false position.\r\nThat she felt the deepest affection for Lewes is evident; that we owe\r\nthe development of her genius to his influence and constant sympathy is\r\nall but certain. Yet it is also sure that what she gained from his\r\nintimate companionship was heavily paid for in the unceasing\r\nconsciousness that most people thought her guilty of a grave mistake,\r\nand found her written words, with their endorsement of traditional\r\nmorality, wholly at variance with the circumstances of her private life.\r\nDoubts of her suffering in this respect will be at once dismissed after\r\na study of her journal and letters. Stilted and unnatural as these are\r\nto a tragic degree, one can read well enough between the lines, and also\r\nin the elaborate dedication of each manuscript to \"my husband\" (in terms\r\nof the strongest love), that self-repression, coupled with audacity,\r\ndoes not make for peace. Her sensitiveness to criticism was extreme; a\r\nflippant paragraph or an illiterate review with regard to her work\r\nactually affected her for days. The whole history of her union with\r\nLewes is a complete illustration of the force of sheer will--in that\r\ncase partly her own and not inconsiderably his--over a nature\r\nessentially unfitted for a bold stand against attacks. At first she and\r\nthe man whom she had described \"as a sort of miniature Mirabeau in\r\nappearance,\" went abroad to Weimar and Berlin, but they returned to\r\nEngland the same year and settled, after several moves, in lodgings at\r\nEast Sheen.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 she published _The Essence of Christianity_, a translation from\r\nFeuerbach, a philosopher to whom she had been introduced by Charles\r\nBray. During 1855 she translated Spinoza's _Ethics_, wrote articles for\r\nthe _Leader_, the _Westminster Review_, and the _Saturday Review_--then\r\na new thing. It was not until the following year that she attempted the\r\nwriting of fiction, and produced _The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos\r\nBarton_--the first of the _Scenes of Clerical Life_. These, published in\r\n_Blackwood's Magazine_, were issued in two volumes in 1858. The press in\r\ngeneral extended a languid welcome to this work, and although the author\r\nreceived much encouragement from private sources, notably from Charles\r\nDickens, the critics were mostly non-committal, and it was not until the\r\npublication of _Adam Bede_ in 1859 that enthusiasm was attracted to the\r\nquality of the earlier production. _Adam Bede_, in the judgment of many\r\nGeorge Eliot's masterpiece, met with a success (in her own words)\r\n\"triumphantly beyond anything she had dreamed of.\" In 1860 appeared _The\r\nMill on the Floss_. After the sensational good fortune of _Adam Bede_,\r\nthe criticism applied to the new novel seems to have been disappointing.\r\nWe find Miss Evans telling her publisher that \"she does not wish to see\r\nany newspaper articles.\" But the book made its way, and prepared an\r\never-growing army of readers for _Silas Marner_ (1861), _Romola_\r\n(1862-1863), and _Felix Holt_ (1866).\r\n\r\n_Silas Marner_ shows a reversion to her early manner--the manner of\r\n_Scenes of Clerical Life_. _Romola_, which is what is called an\r\nhistorical novel, owes its vitality not to the portraits of Savonarola\r\nor of the heroine, or to its vigorous pictures of Florentine life in the\r\n15th century, but to its superb presentment of the treacherous, handsome\r\nTito Melema, who belongs not to any one period but to every generation.\r\n_Felix Holt_, a novel dealing with political questions, is strained by a\r\npainfulness too severe for any reader's pleasure. Where other eminent\r\nauthors have produced mechanical books, or books which were mere\r\nrepetitions of their most popular effort, she erred only on the side of\r\nthe ponderous and the distressing. _Felix Holt_ is both, and it is the\r\nonly one of her novels which lacks an unforgettable human note. _The\r\nSpanish Gypsy_ (1868), a drama in blank verse, received more public\r\nresponse than most compositions of the kind executed by those connected\r\nwith the drama or with poetry only; and she published in 1874 another\r\nvolume of verses, _The Legend of Jubal and other Poems_.\r\n\r\nAny depression which the author may have felt with regard to the faults\r\nfound with some of the last-named books was completely cured by the\r\npraise bestowed on _Middlemarch_ (1872). This profound study of certain\r\ntypes of English character was supreme at the time of its writing, and\r\nit remains supreme, of its school, in European literature. Thackeray is\r\nbrilliant; Tolstoi is vivid to a point where life-likeness overwhelms\r\nany consideration of art; Balzac created a whole world; George Eliot did\r\nnot create, but her exposition of the upper and middle class minds of\r\nher day is a masterpiece of scientific psychology. _Daniel Deronda_\r\n(1876), a production on the same lines, was less satisfactory. It\r\nexhibited the same human insight, the passionate earnestness, the\r\ninsinuated special pleading for hard cases, the same intellectual\r\nstrength, but the subject was unwieldy, almost forbidding, and, as a\r\nresult, the novel, in spite of its distinction, has never been\r\nthoroughly liked. The death of Mr Lewes in 1878 was also the death-blow\r\nto her artistic vitality. She corrected the proofs of _Theophrastus\r\nSuch_ (a collection of essays), but she wrote no more. About two years\r\nlater, however, she married Mr J.W. Cross, a gentleman whose friendship\r\nwas especially congenial to a temperament so abnormally dependent on\r\naffectionate understanding as George Eliot's. But she never really\r\nrecovered from her shock at the loss of George Lewes, and died at 4\r\nCheyne Walk, Chelsea, on the 22nd of December 1880.\r\n\r\nNo right estimate of her, whether as a woman, an artist or a\r\nphilosopher, can be formed without a steady recollection of her infinite\r\ncapacity for mental suffering, and her need of human support. The\r\nstatement that there is no sex in genius, is on the face of it, absurd.\r\nGeorge Sand, certainly the most independent and dazzling of all women\r\nauthors, neither felt, nor wrote, nor thought as a man. Saint Teresa,\r\nanother great writer on a totally different plane, was pre-eminently\r\nfeminine in every word and idea. George Eliot, less reckless, less\r\nromantic than the Frenchwoman, less spiritual than the Spanish saint,\r\nwas more masculine in style than either; but her outlook was not, for a\r\nmoment, the man's outlook; her sincerity, with its odd reserves, was not\r\nquite the same as a man's sincerity, nor was her humour that genial,\r\nbroad, unequivocal humour which is peculiarly virile. Hers approximated,\r\ncuriously enough, to the satire of Jane Austen, both for its irony and\r\nits application to little everyday affairs. Men's humour, in its classic\r\nmanifestations, is on the heroic rather than on the average scale: it is\r\nfor the uncommon situations, not for the daily tea-table.\r\n\r\nHer method of attacking a subject shows the influence of Jane Austen,\r\nespecially in parts of _Middlemarch_; one can detect also the stronger\r\ninfluence of Mrs Gaskell, of Charlotte Bronte, and of Miss Edgeworth. It\r\nwas, however, but an influence, and no more than a man writer, anxious\r\nto acquire a knowledge of the feminine point of view, might have\r\nabsorbed from a study of these women novelists. One often hears that she\r\nis not artistic; that her characterization is less distinct than Jane\r\nAusten's; that she tells more than should be known of her heroes and\r\nheroines. But it should be remembered that Jane Austen dealt with\r\nfamiliar domestic types, whereas George Eliot excelled in the\r\npresentation of extraordinary souls. One woman drew members of polite\r\nsociety with correct notions, while the other woman depicted social\r\nrebels with ideas and ideals. In every one of George Eliot's books, the\r\nprotagonists, tortured by dreams of perfection, are in revolt against\r\nthe prudent compromises of the worldly. All through her stories, one\r\nhears the clash of \"the heroic for earth too high,\" and the desperate\r\nphilosophy, disguised it is true, of Omar Khayyam. In her day,\r\nEpicureanism had not reached the life of the people, nor passed into the\r\neducation of the mob. Few dared to confess that the pursuit of pleasure,\r\nwhether real or imagined, was the aim of mankind. The charm of Jane\r\nAusten is the charm of the untroubled and well-to-do materialist, who\r\nsees in a rich marriage, a comfortable house, carriages and an assured\r\nincome the best to strive for; and in a fickle lover of either sex or\r\nthe loss of money the severest calamities which can befall the human\r\nspirit. Jane Austen despised the greater number of her characters:\r\nGeorge Eliot suffered with each of hers. Here, perhaps, we find the\r\nreason why she is accused of being inartistic. She could not be\r\nimpersonal.\r\n\r\nAgain, George Eliot was a little scornful to those of both sexes who had\r\nneither special missions nor the consciousness of this deprivation. Men\r\nare seldom in favour of missions in any field. She demanded, too\r\nstrenuously from the very beginning, an aim, more or less altruistic,\r\nfrom every individual; and as she advanced in life this claim became the\r\nmore imperative, till at last it overpowered her art, and transformed a\r\ngreat delineator of humanity into an eloquent observer with far too many\r\npersonal prejudices. But she was altogether free from cynicism,\r\nbitterness, or the least tendency to pride of intellect. She suffered\r\nfrom bodily weakness the greater part of her life, and, but for an\r\nextraordinary mental health--inherited from the fine yeoman stock from\r\nwhich she sprang--it is impossible that she could have retained, at all\r\ntimes, so sane a view of human conduct, or been the least sentimental\r\namong women writers of the first rank--the one wholly without morbidity\r\nin any disguise. The accumulation of mere book knowledge, as opposed to\r\nthe friction of a life spent among all sorts and conditions of men,\r\ndrove George Eliot at last to write as a specialist for specialists: joy\r\nwas lost in the consuming desire for strict accuracy: her genius became\r\nmore and more speculative, less and less emotional. The highly trained\r\nbrain suppressed the impulsive heart,--the heart described with such\r\ncandour and pathos as Maggie Tulliver's in _The Mill on the Floss_. For\r\nthis reason--chiefly because philosophy is popularly associated with\r\ninactive depression, whereas human nature is held to be eternally\r\nexhilarating--her later works have not received so much praise as her\r\nearlier productions. But one has only to compare _Romola_ or _Daniel\r\nDeronda_ with the compositions of any author except herself to realize\r\nthe greatness of her designs, and the astonishing gifts brought to their\r\nfinal accomplishment.\r\n\r\n  See also the _Life of George Eliot_, edited by J.W.

C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIOT, SIR JOHN (1592-1632), English statesman, son of Richard Eliot, a\r\nmember of an old Devonshire family lately settled in Cornwall, was born\r\nat his father's seat at Port Eliot in Cornwall in 1592. He matriculated\r\nat Exeter College, Oxford, on the 4th of December 1607, and leaving the\r\nuniversity after a residence of three years he studied law at one of the\r\ninns of court. He also spent some months travelling in France, Spain and\r\nItaly, in company, for part of the time, with young George Villiers,\r\nafterwards duke of Buckingham. He was only twenty-two when he began his\r\nparliamentary career as member for St Germans in the \"addled parliament\"\r\nof 1614. In 1618 he was knighted, and next year through the patronage of\r\nBuckingham he obtained the appointment of vice-admiral of Devon, with\r\nlarge powers for the defence and control of the commerce of the county.\r\nIt was not long before the characteristic energy with which he performed\r\nthe duties in his office involved him in difficulties. After many\r\nattempts, in 1623 he succeeded by a clever but dangerous manoeuvre in\r\nentrapping the famous pirate John Nutt, who had for years infested the\r\nsouthern coast, inflicting immense damage upon English commerce. The\r\nissue is noteworthy. The pirate, having a powerful protector at court in\r\nSir George Calvert, the secretary of state, was pardoned; while the\r\nvice-admiral, upon charges which could not be substantiated, was flung\r\ninto the Marshalsea, and detained there nearly four months.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after his release Eliot was elected member of parliament for\r\nNewport (February 1624). On the 27th of February he delivered his first\r\nspeech, in which he at once revealed his great powers as an orator,\r\ndemanding boldly that the liberties and privileges of parliament,\r\nrepudiated by James I. in the former parliament, should be secured. In\r\nthe first parliament of Charles I., in 1625, he urged the enforcement of\r\nthe laws against the Roman Catholics. Meanwhile he had continued the\r\nfriend and supporter of Buckingham and greatly approved of the war with\r\nSpain. Buckingham's incompetence, however, and the bad faith with which\r\nboth he and the king continued to treat the parliament, alienated Eliot\r\ncompletely from the administration. Distrust of his former friend\r\nquickly grew in Eliot's excitable mind to a certainty of his criminal\r\nambition and treason to his country. Returned to the parliament of 1626\r\nas member for St Germans, he found himself, in the absence of other\r\nchiefs of the opposition whom the king had secured by nominating them\r\nsheriffs, the leader of the House. He immediately demanded an inquiry\r\ninto the recent disaster at Cadiz. On the 27th of March he made an open\r\nand daring attack upon Buckingham and his evil administration. He was\r\nnot intimidated by the king's threatening intervention on the 29th, and\r\npersuaded the House to defer the actual grant of the subsidies and to\r\npresent a remonstrance to the king, declaring its right to examine the\r\nconduct of ministers. On the 8th of May he was one of the managers who\r\ncarried Buckingham's impeachment to the Lords, and on the 10th he\r\ndelivered the charges against him, comparing him in the course of his\r\nspeech to Sejanus. Next day Eliot was sent to the Tower. On the Commons\r\ndeclining to proceed with business as long as Eliot and Sir Dudley\r\nDigges (who had been imprisoned with him) were in confinement, they were\r\nreleased, and parliament was dissolved on the 15th of June. Eliot was\r\nimmediately dismissed from his office of vice-admiral of Devon, and in\r\n1627 he was again imprisoned for refusing to pay a forced loan, but\r\nliberated shortly before the assembling of the parliament of 1628, to\r\nwhich he was returned as member for Cornwall. He joined in the\r\nresistance now organized to arbitrary taxation, was foremost in the\r\npromotion of the Petition of Right, continued his outspoken censure of\r\nBuckingham, and after the latter's assassination in August, led the\r\nattack in the session of 1629 on the ritualists and Arminians.\r\n\r\nIn February the great question of the right of the king to levy tonnage\r\nand poundage came up for discussion; and on the king ordering an\r\nadjournment of parliament, the speaker, Sir John Finch, was held down in\r\nthe chair while Eliot's resolutions against illegal taxation and\r\ninnovations in religion were read to the House by Holles (q.v.). In\r\nconsequence, Eliot, with eight other members, was imprisoned on the 4th\r\nof March in the Tower. He refused to answer in his examination, relying\r\non his privilege of parliament, and on the 29th of October was removed\r\nto the Marshalsea. On the 26th of January he appeared at the bar of the\r\nking's bench, with Holles and Valentine, to answer a charge of\r\nconspiracy to resist the king's order, and refusing to acknowledge the\r\njurisdiction of the court he was fined L2000 and ordered to be\r\nimprisoned during the king's pleasure and till he had made submission.\r\nThis he steadfastly refused. While some of the prisoners appear to have\r\nhad certain liberty allowed to them, Eliot's confinement in the Tower\r\nwas made exceptionally severe. Charles's anger had been from the first\r\ndirected chiefly against him, not only as his own political antagonist\r\nbut as the prosecutor and bitter enemy of Buckingham; \"an outlawed man,\"\r\nhe described him, \"desperate in mind and fortune.\"\r\n\r\nEliot languished in prison for some time, during which he wrote several\r\nworks, his _Negotium posterorum_, an account of the parliament in 1625;\r\n_The Monarchie of Man_, a political treatise; _De jure majestatis, a\r\nPolitical Treatise of Government_; and _An Apology for Socrates_, his\r\nown defence. In the spring of 1632 he fell into a decline. In October he\r\npetitioned Charles for permission to go into the country, but leave\r\ncould only be obtained at the price of submission, and was finally\r\nrefused. He died on the 27th of November 1632. When his son requested\r\npermission to move the body to Port Eliot, Charles, whose resentment\r\nstill survived, returned the curt refusal: \"Let Sir John Eliot be buried\r\nin the church of that parish where he died.\" The manner of Eliot's\r\ndeath, not without suspicion of foul play, and as the result of the\r\nking's implacability and the severe treatment to which he had been\r\nsubjected, had more effect, probably, than any other single incident in\r\nembittering and precipitating the dispute between king and parliament;\r\nand the tragic sacrifice of a man so gifted and patriotic, and actuated\r\noriginally by no antagonistic feeling against the monarchy or the\r\nchurch, is the surest condemnation of the king's policy and\r\nadministration. Eliot was essentially a great orator, inspired by\r\nenthusiasm and high ideals, which he was able to communicate to his\r\nhearers by his eloquence, but, like Chatham afterwards, he had not only\r\nthe gifts but the failings of the orator, was incapable of well-reasoned\r\nand balanced judgment, and, though one of the greatest personalities of\r\nthe time, was inferior to Pym both as a party leader and as a statesman.\r\n\r\nEliot married Rhadagund, daughter of Richard Gedie of Trebursye in\r\nCornwall, by whom he had five sons, from the youngest of whom Nicholas\r\nthe present earl of St Germans is descended, and four daughters.\r\n\r\n  The _Life of Sir J. Eliot_, by J. Forster (1864), is supplemented and\r\n  corrected by Gardiner's _History of England_, vols. v.-vii., and the\r\n  article in the _Dict. of Nat. Biog._, by the same author. Eliot's\r\n  writings, together with his Letter-Book, have been edited by Dr\r\n  Grosart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIOT, JOHN (1604-1690), American colonial clergyman, known as the\r\n\"Apostle to the Indians,\" was born probably at Widford, Hertfordshire,\r\nEngland, where he was baptized on the 5th of August 1604. He was the son\r\nof Bennett Eliot, a middle-class farmer. Little is known of his boyhood\r\nand early manhood except that he took his degree of B.A. at Jesus\r\nCollege, Cambridge, in 1622. It seems probable that he entered the\r\nministry of the Established Church, but there is nothing definitely\r\nknown of him until 1629-1630, when he became an usher or assistant at\r\nthe school of the Rev. Thomas Hooker, at Little Baddow, near Chelmsford.\r\nThe influence of Hooker apparently determined him to become a Puritan,\r\nbut his connexion with the school ceased in 1630, when Laud's\r\npersecutions drove Hooker into exile. The realization of the\r\ndifficulties in the way of a non-conforming clergyman in England\r\nundoubtedly determined Eliot to emigrate to America in the autumn of\r\n1631, where he settled first at Boston, assisting for a time at the\r\nFirst Church. In November 1632 he became \"teacher\" to the church at\r\nRoxbury, with which his connexion lasted until his death. There he\r\nmarried Hannah Mulford, who had been betrothed to him in England, and\r\nwho became his constant helper. In the care of the Roxbury church he was\r\nassociated with Thomas Welde from 1632 to 1641, with Samuel Danforth\r\n(1626-1674) from 1649 to 1674, and with Nehemiah Walter (1663-1750) from\r\n1688 to 1690.\r\n\r\nInspired with the idea of converting the Indians, his first step was to\r\nperfect himself in their dialects, which he did by the assistance of a\r\nyoung Indian whom he received into his home. With his aid he translated\r\nthe Ten Commandments and the Lord's Prayer. He first successfully\r\npreached to the Indians in their own tongue at Nonantum (Newton) in\r\nOctober 1646. At the third meeting several Indians declared themselves\r\nconverted, and were soon followed by many others. Eliot induced the\r\nMassachusetts General Court to set aside land for their residence, the\r\nsame body also voting him L10 to prosecute the work, and directing that\r\ntwo clergymen be annually elected by the clergy as preachers to the\r\nIndians. As soon as the success of Eliot's endeavours became known, the\r\nnecessary funds flowed in upon him from private sources in both Old and\r\nNew England. In July 1649 parliament incorporated the \"Society for the\r\nPropagation of the Gospel in New England,\" which henceforth supported\r\nand directed the work inaugurated by Eliot. The first appeal for aid\r\nbrought contributions of L11,000. In 1651 the Christian Indian town\r\nfounded by Eliot was removed from Nonantum to Natick, where residences,\r\na meeting-house, and a school-house were erected, and where Eliot\r\npreached, when able, once in every two weeks as long as he lived. To\r\nthis community Eliot applied a plan of government by means of tens,\r\nfifties and hundreds, which he subsequently advocated as suitable for\r\nall England. Eliot's missionary labours encouraged others to follow in\r\nhis footsteps. A second town under his direction was established at\r\nPonkapog (Stoughton) in 1654, in which he had the assistance of Daniel\r\nGookin (c. 1612-1687). His success was duplicated in Martha's Vineyard\r\nand Nantucket by the Mayhews, and by 1674 the unofficial census of the\r\n\"praying Indians\" numbered 4000. King Philip's War (1675-76) was a\r\nstaggering blow to all missionary enterprise; and although few of the\r\nconverted Indians proved disloyal, it was some years before adequate\r\nsupport could again be enlisted. Yet at Eliot's death, which occurred at\r\nRoxbury on the 21st of May 1690, the missions were at the height of\r\ntheir prosperity, and that the results of his labours were not permanent\r\nwas due only to the racial traits of the New England tribes.\r\n\r\nOf wider influence and more lasting value than his personal labours as a\r\nmissionary was Eliot's work as a translator of the Bible and various\r\nreligious works into the Massachusetts dialect of the Algonquian\r\nlanguage. The first work completed was the _Catechism_, published in\r\n1653 at Cambridge, Massachusetts, the first book to be printed in the\r\nIndian tongue. Several years elapsed before Eliot completed his task of\r\ntranslating the Bible. The New Testament was at last issued in 1661, and\r\nthe Old Testament followed two years later. The New Testament was bound\r\nwith it, and thus the whole Bible was completed. To it were added a\r\nCatechism and a metrical version of the Psalms. The title of this Bible,\r\nnow a great rarity, is _Mamussee Wunneetupanatamwe Up-Biblum God\r\nnaneeswe Nukkone Testament kah wonk Wusku Testament-Ne quoshkinnumuk\r\nnashpe Wuttinneumoh Christ noh assoowesit John Eliot_; literally\r\ntranslated, \"The Whole Holy His-Bible God, both Old Testament and also\r\nNew Testament. This turned by the-servant-of-Christ, who is called John\r\nEliot.\"\r\n\r\n  This book was printed in 1663 at Cambridge, Mass., by Samuel Green and\r\n  Marmaduke Johnson, and was the first Bible printed in America. In 1685\r\n  appeared a second edition, in the preparation of which Eliot was\r\n  assisted by the Rev. John Cotton (1640-1699), the younger, of\r\n  Plymouth, who also had a wide knowledge of the Indian tongue.\r\n\r\nBesides his Bible, Eliot published at Cambridge in 1664 a translation of\r\nBaxter's _Call to the Unconverted_, and in 1665 an abridged translation\r\nof Bishop Bayly's _Practice of Piety_. With the assistance of his sons\r\nhe completed (1664) his well-known Indian Grammar Begun, printed at\r\nCambridge, Massachusetts, in 1666. It was reprinted in vol. ix. of the\r\n_Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society_. _The Indian\r\nPrimer_, comprising an exposition of the Lord's Prayer and a translation\r\nof the Larger Catechism, was published at Cambridge in 1669, and was\r\nreprinted under the editorial superintendence of Mr John Small of the\r\nuniversity of Edinburgh in 1877. In 1671 Eliot printed in English a\r\nlittle volume entitled _Indian Dialogues_, followed in 1672 by his\r\n_Logick Primer_, both of which were intended for the instruction of the\r\nIndians in English. His last translation was Thomas Shepard's _Sincere\r\nConvert_, completed and published by Grindal Rawson in 1689. Eliot's\r\nliterary activity, however, extended into other fields than that of\r\nIndian instruction. He was, with Richard Mather, one of the editors of\r\nthe _Bay Psalm Book_ (1640). Several tracts written wholly or in part by\r\nhim in the nature of reports to the society which supported his missions\r\nwere published at various times in England. In 1660 he published a\r\ncurious treatise on government entitled _The Christian Commonwealth_, in\r\nwhich he found the ideal of government in the ancient Jewish state, and\r\nproposed the reorganization of the English government on the basis of a\r\nnumerical subdivision of the inhabitants. His _Harmony of the Gospels_\r\n(1678) was a life of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--An account of Eliot's life and work is contained in\r\n  Williston Walker's _Ten New England Leaders_ (New York, 1901). There\r\n  is a \"Life of John Eliot,\" by Convers Francis, in _Sparks' American\r\n  Biography_, vol. v. (New York, 1853); another by N. Adams (Boston,\r\n  1847); and a sketch in Cotton Mather's _Magnalia_ (London, 1702). For\r\n  a good account of his publications in the Indian language see the\r\n  chapter on \"The Indian Tongue and its Literature,\" by J.H. Trumbull,\r\n  in vol. i. of the _Memorial History of Boston_ (1882).     (W. Wr.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIS, or ELEIA, an ancient district of southern Greece, bounded on the\r\nN. by Achaea, E. by Arcadia, S. by Messenia, and W. by the Ionian Sea.\r\nThe local form of the name was Valis, or Valeia, and its meaning, in all\r\nprobability, \"the lowland.\" In its physical constitution Elis is\r\npractically one with Achaea and Arcadia; its mountains are mere\r\noffshoots of the Arcadian highlands, and its principal rivers are fed by\r\nArcadian springs. From Erymanthus in the north, Skollis (now known as\r\nMavri and Santameri in different parts of its length) stretches toward\r\nthe west, and Pholoe along the eastern frontier; in the south a\r\nprolongation of Mount Lycaeon bore in ancient times the names of Minthe\r\nand Lapithus, which have given place respectively to Alvena and to\r\nKaiapha and Smerna. These mountains are well clothed with vegetation,\r\nand present a soft and pleasing appearance in contrast to the\r\npicturesque wildness of the parent ranges. They gradually sink towards\r\nthe west and die off into what was one of the richest alluvial tracts in\r\nthe Peloponnesus. Except where it is broken by the rocky promontories of\r\nChelonatas (now Chlemutzi) and Ichthys (now Katakolo), the coast lies\r\nlow, with stretches of sand in the north and lagoons and marshes towards\r\nthe south. During the summer months communication with the sea being\r\nestablished by means of canals, these lagoons yield a rich harvest of\r\nfish to the inhabitants, who at the same time, however, are almost\r\ndriven from the coast by the swarms of gnats. The district for\r\nadministrative purposes forms part of the nome of Elis and Achaea (see\r\nGREECE).\r\n\r\nElis was divided into three districts--Hollow or Lowland Elis ([Greek:\r\nhe kohile Elis]), Pisatis, or the territory of Pisa, and Triphylia, or\r\nthe country of the three tribes. (1) _Hollow Elis_, the largest and most\r\nnorthern of the three, was watered by the Peneus and its tributary the\r\nLadon, whose united stream forms the modern Gastouni. It included not\r\nonly the champaign country originally designated by its name, but also\r\nthe mountainous region of Acrorea, occupied by the offshoots of\r\nErymanthus. Besides the capital city of Elis, it contained Cyllene, an\r\nArcadian settlement on the sea-coast, whose inhabitants worshipped\r\nHermes under the phallic symbol; Pylus, at the junction of the Peneus\r\nand the Ladon, which, like so many other places of the same name,\r\nclaimed to be the city of Nestor, and the fortified frontier town of\r\nLasion, the ruins of which are still visible at Kuti, near the village\r\nof Kumani. The district was famous in antiquity for its cattle and\r\nhorses; and its byssus, supposed to have been introduced by the\r\nPhoenicians, was inferior only to that of Palestine. (2) _Pisatis_\r\nextended south from Hollow Elis to the right bank of the Alpheus, and\r\nwas divided into eight departments called after as many towns. Of these\r\nSalmone, Heraclea, Cicysion, Dyspontium and Harpina are known--the last\r\nbeing the reputed burial-place of Marmax, the suitor of Hippodamia. From\r\nthe time of the early investigators it has been disputed whether Pisa,\r\nwhich gave its name to the district, has ever been a city, or was only a\r\nfountain or a hill. By far the most important spot in Pisatis was the\r\nscene of the great Olympic games, on the northern bank of the Alpheus\r\n(see OLYMPIA). (3) _Triphylia_ stretches south from the Alpheus to the\r\nNeda, which forms the boundary towards Messenia. Of the nine towns\r\nmentioned by Polybius, only two attained to any considerable\r\ninfluence--Lepreum and Macistus, which gave the names of Lepreatis and\r\nMacistia to the southern and northern halves of Triphylia. The former\r\nwas the seat of a strongly independent population, and continued to take\r\nevery opportunity of resisting the supremacy of the Eleans. In the time\r\nof Pausanias it was in a very decadent condition, and possessed only a\r\npoor brick-built temple of Demeter; but considerable remains of its\r\nouter walls are still in existence near the village of Strovitzi, on a\r\npart of the Minthe range.\r\n\r\nThe original inhabitants of Elis were called Caucones and Paroreatae.\r\nThey are mentioned for the first time in Greek history under the title\r\nof Epeians, as setting out for the Trojan War, and they are described by\r\nHomer as living in a state of constant hostility with their neighbours\r\nthe Pylians. At the close of the 11th century B.C. the Dorians invaded\r\nthe Peloponnesus, and Elis fell to the share of Oxylus and the\r\nAetolians. These people, amalgamating with the Epeians, formed a\r\npowerful kingdom in the north of Elis. After this many changes took\r\nplace in the political distribution of the country, till at length it\r\ncame to acknowledge only three tribes, each independent of the others.\r\nThese tribes were the Epeians, Minyae and Eleans. Before the end of the\r\n8th century B.C., however, the Eleans had vanquished both their rivals,\r\nand established their supremacy over the whole country. Among the other\r\nadvantages which they thus gained was the right of celebrating the\r\nOlympic games, which had formerly been the prerogative of the Pisatans.\r\nThe attempts which this people made to recover their lost privilege,\r\nduring a period of nearly two hundred years, ended at length in the\r\ntotal destruction of their city by the Eleans. From the time of this\r\nevent (572 B.C.) till the Peloponnesian War, the peace of Elis remained\r\nundisturbed. In that great contest Elis sided at first with Sparta; but\r\nthat power, jealous of the increasing prosperity of its ally, availed\r\nitself of the first pretext to pick a quarrel. At the battle of Mantinea\r\n(418 B.C.) the Eleans fought against the Spartans, who, as soon as the\r\nwar came to a close, took vengeance upon them by depriving them of\r\nTriphylia and the towns of the Acrorea. The Eleans made no attempt to\r\nre-establish their authority over these places, till the star of Thebes\r\nrose in the ascendant after the battle of Leuctra (371 B.C.). It is not\r\nunlikely that they would have effected their purpose had not the\r\nArcadian confederacy come to the assistance of the Triphylians. In 366\r\nB.C. hostilities broke out between them, and though the Eleans were at\r\nfirst successful, they were soon overpowered, and their capital very\r\nnearly fell into the hands of the enemy. Unable to make head against\r\ntheir opponents, they applied for assistance to the Spartans, who\r\ninvaded Arcadia, and forced the Arcadians to recall their troops from\r\nElis. The general result of this war was the restoration of their\r\nterritory to the Eleans, who were also again invested with the right of\r\nholding the Olympic games. During the Macedonian supremacy in Greece\r\nthey sided with the victors, but refused to fight against their\r\ncountrymen. After the death of Alexander they renounced the Macedonian\r\nalliance. At a subsequent period they joined the Aetolian League, but\r\npersistently refused to identify themselves with the Achaeans. When the\r\nwhole of Greece fell under the Roman yoke, the sanctity of Olympia\r\nsecured for the Eleans a certain amount of indulgence. The games still\r\ncontinued to attract to the country large numbers of strangers, until\r\nthey were finally put down by Theodosius in 394, two years previous to\r\nthe utter destruction of the country by the Gothic invasion under\r\nAlaric. In later times Elis fell successively into the hands of the\r\nFranks and the Venetians, under whose rule it recovered to some extent\r\nits ancient prosperity. By the latter people the province of Belvedere\r\non the Peneus was called, in consequence of its fertility, \"the milch\r\ncow of the Morea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIS, the chief city of the ancient Greek district of Elis, was situated\r\non the river Peneus, just where it passes from the mountainous district\r\nof Acrorea into the champaign below. According to native tradition, it\r\nwas originally founded by Oxylus, the leader of the Aetolians, whose\r\nstatue stood in the market-place. In 471 B.C. it received a great\r\nextension by the incorporation (synoecism) of various small hamlets,\r\nwhose inhabitants took up their abode in the city. Up to this date it\r\nonly occupied the ridge of the hill now called Kalaskopi, to the south\r\nof the Peneus, but afterwards it spread out in several suburbs, and even\r\nto the other side of the stream. As all the athletes who intended to\r\ntake part in the Olympic games were obliged to undergo a month's\r\ntraining in the city, its gymnasiums were among its principal\r\ninstitutions. They were three in number--the \"Xystos,\" with its avenues\r\nof plane-trees, its plethrion or wrestling-place, its altars to\r\nHeracles, to Eros and Anteros, to Demeter and Kore (Cora), and its\r\ncenotaph of Achilles; the \"Tetragonon,\" appropriated to boxing\r\nexercises; and the \"Maltho,\" in the interior of which was a hall or\r\ncouncil chamber called Lalichmion after its founder. The market-place\r\nwas of the old-fashioned type, with porticoes at intervals and paths\r\nleading between them. It was called the Hippodrome because it was\r\ncommonly used for exercising horses. Among the other objects of interest\r\nwere the temple of Artemis Philomirax; the Hellanodicaeon, or office of\r\nthe Hellanodicae; the Corcyrean Hall, a building in the Dorian style\r\nwith two facades, built of spoils from Corcyra; a temple of Apollo\r\nAcesius; a temple of Silenus; an ancient structure supported on oaken\r\npillars and reputed to be the burial-place of Oxylus; the building where\r\nthe sixteen women of Elis were wont to weave a robe for the statue of\r\nHera at Olympia; the temple of Aphrodite, with a statue of the goddess\r\nby Pheidias as Urania with a tortoise beneath her foot, and by Scopas as\r\nPandemos, riding on a goat; and the shrine of Dionysus, whose festival,\r\nthe Thyia, was yearly celebrated in the neighbourhood. On the acropolis\r\nwas a temple of Athena, with a gold and ivory statue by Pheidias. The\r\nhistory of the town is closely identified with that of the country. In\r\n399 B.C. it was occupied by Agis, king of Sparta. The acropolis was\r\nfortified in 312 by Telesphorus, the admiral of Antigonus, but it was\r\nshortly afterwards dismantled by Philemon, another of his generals. A\r\nview of the site is given by Stanhope. It is now called Palaeopolis. No\r\ntraces of any buildings can be identified, the only remains visible\r\ndating from Roman times.\r\n\r\n  See Pausanias vi. 23-26; J. Spencer Stanhope, _Olympia and Elis_\r\n  (1824), folio; W.M. Leake, _Morea_ (1830); E. Curtius, _Peloponnesus_\r\n  (1851-1852); Schiller, _Stamme und Staaten Griechenlands_; C.

This school was founded by Phaedo, a\r\npupil of Socrates. It existed for a very short time and was then\r\ntransferred by Menedemus to Eretria, where it became known as the\r\nEretrian school. Its chief members, beside Phaedo, were Anchipylus,\r\nMoschus and Pleistanus (see PHAEDO and MENEDEMUS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELISAVETGRAD, a fortress and town of Russia, in the government of\r\nKherson, 296 m. by rail N.E. of Odessa on the Balta-Kremenchug railway,\r\nand on the Ingul river, in 48 deg. 31' N. and 32 deg. 10' E. The\r\npopulation increased from 23,725 in 1860 to 66,182 in 1900. The town is\r\nregularly built, with wide streets, some of them lined with trees, and\r\nis a wealthy town, which has become an industrial centre for the region\r\nespecially on account of its steam flour-mills, in which it is second\r\nonly to Odessa, its distilleries, mechanical workshops, tobacco and\r\ntallow factories and brickworks. It is an important centre for trade in\r\ncereals and flour for export, and in sheep, cattle, wool, leather and\r\ntimber. Five fairs are held annually. It has a military school, a\r\nfirst-class meteorological station and a botanical garden. The town was\r\nfounded in 1754 and named after the empress Elizabeth. The\r\nfortifications are now decayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELISAVETPOL, a government of Russia, Transcaucasia, having the\r\ngovernments of Tiflis and Daghestan on the N., Baku on the E., and\r\nErivan and Tiflis on the W. and Persia on the S. Area, 16,721 sq. m. It\r\nincludes: (a) the southern slope of the main Caucasus range in the\r\nnorth-east, where Bazardyuzi (14,770 ft.) and other peaks rise above the\r\nsnow-line; (b) the arid and unproductive steppes beside the Kura,\r\nreaching 1000 ft. of altitude in the west and sinking to 100-200 ft. in\r\nthe east, where irrigation is necessary; and (c) the northern slopes of\r\nthe Transcaucasian escarpment and portions of the Armenian plateau,\r\nwhich is intersected towards its western boundary, near Lake Gok-cha, by\r\nchains of mountains consisting of trachytes and various crystalline\r\nrocks, and reaching 12,845 ft. in Mount Kapujikh. Elsewhere the country\r\nhas the character of a plateau, 7000 to 8000 ft. high, deeply trenched\r\nby tributaries of the Aras. All varieties of climate are found from that\r\nof the snowclad peaks, Alpine meadows, and stony deserts of the high\r\nlevels, to that of the hill slopes, clothed with gardens and vineyards,\r\nand of the arid Caspian steppes. Thus, at Shusha, on the plateau, at an\r\naltitude of 3680 ft., the average temperatures are: year 48 deg.,\r\nJanuary 26 deg., July 66 deg.; annual rainfall, 26.4; while at\r\nElisavetpol, in the valley of the Kura, they are: year 55 deg., January\r\n32 deg. 2, July 77 deg. and rainfall only 10.3 in. Nearly one-fifth of\r\nthe surface is under forests.\r\n\r\nThe population which was 885,379 in 1897 (only 392,124 women; 84,130\r\nurban), and was estimated at 953,300 in 1906, consists chiefly of Tatars\r\n(56%) and Armenians (33%). The remainder are Kurds (4.7%), Russians and\r\na few Germans, Jews, Kurins, Udins and Tates. Peasants form the great\r\nbulk of the population. Some of the Tatars and the Kurds are nomadic.\r\nWheat, maize, barley, oats and rye are grown, also rice. Cultivation of\r\ncotton has begun, but the rearing of silkworms is of old standing,\r\nespecially at Nukha (1650 tons of cocoons on the average are obtained\r\nevery year). Nearly 8000 acres are under vines, the yield of wine\r\naveraging 82-1/2 million gallons annually. Gardening reaches a high\r\nstandard of perfection. Liquorice root is obtained to the extent of\r\nabout 35,000 tons annually. The rearing of live-stock is largely carried\r\non on the steppes. Copper, magnetic iron ore, cobalt and a small\r\nquantity of naphtha are extracted, and nearly 10,000 persons are\r\nemployed in manufacturing industry--copper works and silk-mills.\r\nCarpet-weaving is widely spread. Owing to the Transcaucasian railway,\r\nwhich crosses the government, trade, both in the interior and with\r\nPersia, is very brisk. The government is divided into eight districts,\r\nElisavetpol, Aresh, Jebrail, Jevanshir, Kazakh, Nukha, Shusha and\r\nZangezur. The only towns, besides the capital, are Nukha (24,811\r\ninhabitants in 1897) and Shusha (25,656).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELISAVETPOL (formerly _Ganja_, alternative names being KENJEH and\r\nKANGA), a town of Russia, capital of the government of the same name,\r\n118 m. by rail S.E. of Tiflis and 3-1/2 m. from the railway, at an\r\naltitude of 1446 ft. Pop. (1873) 15,439; (1897) 33,090. It is a very old\r\ntown, which changed hands between Persians, Khazars and Arabs even in\r\nthe 7th century, and later fell into the possession of Mongols,\r\nGeorgians, Persians and Turks successively, until the Russians took it\r\nin 1804, when the change of name was made. It is a badly built place,\r\nwith narrow streets and low-roofed, windowless houses, and is situated\r\nin a very unhealthy locality, but has been much improved, a new European\r\nquarter having been built on the site of the old fortress (erected by\r\nthe Turks in 1712-1724). The inhabitants are chiefly Tatars and\r\nArmenians, famed for their excellent gardening, and also for silkworm\r\nbreeding. It has a beautiful mosque, built by Shah Abbas of Persia in\r\n1620; and a renowned \"Green Mosque\" amidst the ruins of old Ganja, 4 m.\r\ndistant. The Persian poet, Shah Nizam (Nizam-ed-Din), was born here in\r\n1141, and is said to have been buried (1203) close to the town. The\r\nPersians were defeated by the Russians under Paskevich outside this town\r\nin 1826.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELISHA (a Hebrew name meaning \"God is deliverance\"), in the Bible, the\r\ndisciple and successor of Elijah, was the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah\r\nin the valley of the Jordan. He was symbolically elected to the\r\nprophetic office by Elijah some time during the reign of Ahab (1 Kings\r\nxix. 19-21), and he survived until the reign of Joash. His career thus\r\nappears to have extended over a period of nearly sixty years. The\r\nrelation between Elijah and Elisha was of a particularly close kind, but\r\nthe difference between them is much more striking than the resemblance.\r\nElijah is the prophet of the wilderness, wandering, rugged and austere;\r\nElisha is the prophet of civilized life, of the city and the court, with\r\nthe dress, manners and appearance of ordinary \"grave citizens.\" Elijah\r\nis the messenger of vengeance--sudden, fierce and overwhelming; Elisha\r\nis the messenger of mercy and restoration. Elijah's miracles, with few\r\nexceptions, are works of wrath and destruction; Elisha's miracles, with\r\nbut one notable exception, are works of beneficence and healing. Elijah\r\nis the \"prophet as fire\" (Ecclus, xlviii. 1), an abnormal agent working\r\nfor exceptional ends; Elisha is the \"holy man of God which passeth by us\r\ncontinually\" (2 Kings iv. 9), mixing in the common life of the people.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to draw up a detailed chronology of his life. In most\r\nof the events narrated no further indication of time is given than by\r\nthe words \"the king of Israel,\" the name not being specified. There are\r\nsome instances in which the order of time is obviously the reverse of\r\nthe order of narrative, and there are other grounds for concluding that\r\nthe narrative as we now have it is confused and incomplete. This may\r\nserve not only to explain the chronological difficulties, but also to\r\nthrow some light on the altogether exceptional character of the\r\nmiraculous element in Elisha's history. On the literary questions, see\r\nfurther KINGS.\r\n\r\nNot only are Elisha's miracles very numerous, even more so than those of\r\nElijah, but they stand in a peculiar relation to the man and his work.\r\nWith all the other prophets the primary function is spiritual teaching;\r\nmiracles, even though numerous and many of them symbolical like\r\nElisha's, are only accessory. With Elisha, on the other hand, miracles\r\nseem the principal function, and the teaching is altogether subsidiary.\r\nAn explanation of the superabundance of miracles in Elisha's life is\r\nsuggested by the fact that several of them were merely repetitions or\r\ndoubles of those of his predecessor. Such were: his first miracle, when,\r\nreturning across the Jordan, he made a dry path for himself in the same\r\nmanner as Elijah (2 Kings ii. 14); the increase of the widow's pot of\r\noil (iv. 1-7); and the restoration of the son of the woman of Shunem to\r\nlife (iv. 18-37). The theory that stories from the earlier life have\r\nbeen imported by mistake into the later, even if tenable, applies only\r\nto three of the miracles, and leaves unexplained a much larger number\r\nwhich are not only not repetitions of those of Elijah, but have an\r\nentirely opposite character. The healing of the water of Jericho by\r\nputting salt in it (ii. 19-22), the provision of water for the army of\r\nJehoshaphat in the arid desert (iii. 6-20), the neutralizing by meal of\r\nthe poison in the pottage of the famine-stricken sons of the prophets at\r\nJericho (iv. 38-41), the healing of Naaman the Syrian (v. 1-19), and the\r\nrecovery of the iron axehead that had sunk in the water (vi. 1-7), are\r\nall instances of the beneficence which was the general characteristic of\r\nElisha's wonder-working activity in contrast to that of Elijah. Another\r\nmiracle of the same class, the feeding of a hundred men with twenty\r\nloaves so that something was left over (iv. 42-44), deserves mention as\r\nthe most striking though not the only instance of a resemblance between\r\nthe work of Elisha and that of Jesus (Matt. xiv. 13-21). The one\r\ndistinct exception to the general beneficence of Elisha's activity--the\r\ndestruction of the forty-two children who mocked him as he was going up\r\nto Bethel (2 Kings ii. 23-25)--presents an ethical difficulty which is\r\nscarcely removed by the suggestion that the narrative has lost some\r\nparticulars which would have shown the real enormity of the children's\r\noffence. We may prefer to imagine that among the homely stories told of\r\nhim was one which had for its main object the inculcation of respect for\r\none's elders.[1] The leprosy brought upon Gehazi (v. 20-27), though a\r\nmiracle of judgment, scarcely belongs to the same class as the other;\r\nand it will be observed that Gehazi's subsequent relations with the\r\ncourt (viii. 1-6) ignore the disease, a fatal hindrance to intercourse.\r\nFurther, the healing of Naaman (alluded to in Luke iv. 27) presupposes\r\npeaceful relations between Israel and the Syrians, with which, however,\r\ncontrast ch. vi. The wonder-working power of Elisha is represented as\r\ncontinuing even after his death. As the feeding of the hundred men and\r\nthe cure of leprosy connect his work with that of Jesus, so the story\r\nthat a dead man who was cast into his sepulchre was brought to life by\r\nthe mere contact with his bones (2 Kings xiii. 21, cf. Ecclus. xlviii.\r\n12-14) is the most striking instance of an analogy between his miracles\r\nand those recorded of medieval saints. Stanley (_Jewish Church_, 4th\r\ned., ii. 276) in reference to this has remarked that in the life of\r\nElisha alone \"in the sacred history the gulf between biblical and\r\necclesiastical miracles almost disappears.\"\r\n\r\nThe place which Elisha filled in contemporary history was one of great\r\ninfluence and importance, and several narratives testify to his great\r\nreputation in Israel. On one occasion, when he delivered the army that\r\nhad been brought out against Moab from a threatened dearth of water (2\r\nKings iii.),[2] he plainly intimates that, but for his regard to\r\nJehoshaphat, the king of Judah, who was in alliance with Israel, he\r\nwould not have interfered. Whether he was with the army or was supposed\r\nto be living in the desert is left obscure. An interesting touch is the\r\ninfluence of music upon the prophetic mind (_v._ 15). His next signal\r\ninterference was during the incursions of the Syrians, when he disclosed\r\nthe plans of the invaders to the \"king of Israel\" with such effect that\r\nthey were again and again baffled. When the \"king of Syria\" was informed\r\nthat \"Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel\r\nthe words that thou speakest in thy bed-chamber,\" he at once sent an\r\narmy to take him captive in Dothan. At Elisha's prayer his terrified\r\nservant beheld an army of horses and chariots of fire surrounding the\r\nprophet. At a second prayer the invaders were struck blind, and in this\r\nstate they were led by Elisha to Samaria, where their sight was\r\nrestored. Their lives were spared at the command of the prophet, and\r\nthey returned home so impressed that their incursions thenceforward\r\nceased (vi. 8-23). This is immediately followed by the siege of Samaria\r\nby Benhadad which caused a famine of the severest kind. The calamity was\r\nimputed by the \"king of Israel\" to the influence of Elisha, and he\r\nordered the prophet to be immediately put to death. Forewarned of the\r\ndanger, Elisha ordered the messenger who had been sent to slay him to be\r\ndetained at the door, and, when, immediately afterwards, the king\r\nhimself came (\"messenger\" in vi. 33 should rather be _king_), predicted\r\na great plenty within twenty-four hours. This was fulfilled by the\r\nflight of the Syrian army under the circumstances stated in ch. vii.\r\nAfter the episode with regard to the woman of Shunem (viii. 1-6), which\r\nis out of its chronological order, Elisha is represented as at Damascus\r\n(viii. 7-15). The reverence with which the foreign monarch Benhadad\r\naddressed Elisha deserves to be noted as showing the extent of the\r\nprophet's influence. In sending to know the issue of his illness, the\r\nking caused himself to be styled \"_thy son_ Benhadad.\" Equally\r\nremarkable is the very ambiguous nature of Elisha's reply (viii.\r\n10).[3] The most important interference of Elisha in the history of his\r\ncountry constituted the fulfilment of the third of the commands laid\r\nupon Elijah. The work of anointing Jehu to be king over Israel was\r\nperformed by deputy (ix. 1-3). During the forty-five years which the\r\nchronological scheme allows for the reigns of Jehu and Jehoahaz the\r\nnarratives contain no notice of Elisha, but from the circumstances of\r\nhis death (xiii. 14-21) it is clear that he had continued to enjoy the\r\nesteem of the dynasty which he had helped to found. Joash, the grandson\r\nof Jehu, waited on him on his death-bed, and addressed him in the words\r\nwhich he himself had used to Elijah: \"My father, my father, the chariot\r\nof Israel and the horsemen thereof\" (cf. ii. 12). By the result of a\r\nsymbolic discharge of arrows he informed the king of his coming success\r\nagainst Syria, and immediately thereafter he died. The explicit\r\nstatement that he was buried completes the contrast between him and his\r\ngreater predecessor.\r\n\r\n  On the narratives, see KINGS. In general those where \"the prophet\r\n  appears as on friendly terms with the king, and possessed of influence\r\n  at court (e.g. 2 Kings iv. 13, vi. 9, vi. 21, compared with xiii. 14),\r\n  plainly belong to the time of Jehu's dynasty, though they are related\r\n  before the fall of the house of Omri. We can distinguish portions of\r\n  an historical narrative which speaks of Elisha in connexion with\r\n  events of public interest, without making him the central figure, and\r\n  a series of anecdotes of properly biographical character.... In the\r\n  latter we may distinguish one circle connected with Gilgal, Jericho\r\n  and the Jordan valley to which Abel-Meholah belongs (iv. 1-7? 38-44,\r\n  v.? vi. 1-7). Here Elisha appears as the head of the prophetic gilds,\r\n  having his fixed residence at Gilgal.[4] Another circle, which\r\n  presupposes the accession of the house of Jehu, places him at Dothan\r\n  or Carmel, and represents him as a personage of almost superhuman\r\n  dignity. Here there is an obvious parallelism with the history of\r\n  Elijah, especially with his ascension (cf. 2 Kings vi. 17 with ii. 11;\r\n  xiii. 14 with ii. 12); and it is to this group of narratives that the\r\n  ascension of Elijah forms the introduction\" (Robertson Smith, _Ency.\r\n  Brit._, 9th ed., art. KINGS, vol. xiv. p. 186). This twofold\r\n  representation finds a parallel in the narratives of Samuel, whose\r\n  history and the conditions reflected therein are analogous to the life\r\n  and times of Elisha.\r\n\r\n  Elisha is canonized in the Orthodox Eastern Church, his festival being\r\n  on the 14th of June, under which date his life is entered in the _Acta\r\n  sanctorum_.\r\n\r\n  See especially, W.R. Smith, _Prophets of Israel_ (Index, s.v.), and\r\n  the literature to ELIJAH; KINGS, BOOKS OF; PROPHET.\r\n       (W. R. S.; S. A. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Similarly Elijah enforces respect for the prophetic office in i.\r\n    9 sqq. Prof. Kennett points out to the present writer that the\r\n    epithet \"bald-head\" may refer to the sign of mourning for Elisha's\r\n    lost master (cf. Ez. vii. 18, Deut. xiv. 1); \"Go up\" is perhaps to be\r\n    taken literally (in reference to Elijah's translation).\r\n\r\n  [2] The method of obtaining water (_v._ 16 sq.) is that which still\r\n    gives its name to the Wadi el-Ahsa (\"valley of water pits\") at the\r\n    southern end of the Dead Sea (_Old Test. Jew. Church_, 2nd ed., 147).\r\n    On the other hand, see Burney, _Heb. Text of Kings_, p. 270.\r\n\r\n  [3] R. V. marg. is an alteration to remove from Elisha the suggestion\r\n    of an untruth.\r\n\r\n  [4] The Gilgal of Elisha is near the Jordan--comp. vi. 1 with iv. 38,\r\n    [Hebrew: shavim lefanaiv],--and cannot be other than the great\r\n    sanctuary 2 m. from Jericho, the local holiness of which is still\r\n    attested in the _Onomastica_. It is true that in 2 Kings ii. 1 Bethel\r\n    seems to lie between Gilgal and Jericho; but v. 25 shows that Gilgal\r\n    was not originally represented as Elisha's residence in this\r\n    narrative, which belongs to the Carmel-Dothan series. On the other\r\n    hand, for the identification with the Gilgal (Jiljilia) S.W. of\r\n    Shiloh, see G.A. Smith, _Ency. Bib._ (s.v.

He was born before the destruction\r\nof the Temple (which occurred in A.D. 70) and survived into the 2nd\r\ncentury. It is not easy to decide as to his exact attitude towards\r\nJudaism. That he refused to accept the current rabbinical views is\r\ncertain, though the Talmud cites his legal decisions. Most authorities\r\nbelieve that he was a Gnostic; but while it is certain that he was not a\r\nChristian, it is possible that he was simply a Sadducee, and thus an\r\nopponent not of Judaism but of Pharisaism. His disciple, the famous\r\nPharisee Meir, remained his steadfast friend, and his efforts to reclaim\r\nhis former master are among the most pathetic incidents in the Talmud.\r\nIn later ages Elisha (_aher_ \"the other,\" as he was named) was regarded\r\nas the type of a heretic whose pride of intellect betrayed him into\r\ninfidelity to law and morals. Without much appropriateness Elisha has\r\nbeen sometimes described as the \"Faust of the Talmud.\"     (I. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIXIR (from the Arabic _al-iksir_, probably an adaptation of the Gr.\r\n[Greek: xerion], a powder used for drying wounds, from [Greek: xeros],\r\ndry), in alchemy, the medium which would effect the transmutation of base\r\nmetals into gold; it probably included all such substances--vapours,\r\nliquids, &c.--and had a wider meaning than \"philosopher's stone.\" The\r\nsame term, more fully _elixir_ _vitae_, elixir of life, was given to the\r\nsubstance which would indefinitely prolong life; it was considered to be\r\nclosely related to, or even identical with, the substance for transmuting\r\nmetals. In pharmacy the word was formerly given to a strong extract or\r\ntincture, but it is only used now for an aromatic sweet preparation,\r\ncontaining one or more drugs, and in such expressions as \"elixir of\r\nvitriol,\" a mixture of sulphuric acid, cinnamon, ginger and alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH (1533-1603), queen of England and Ireland, born on Sunday the\r\n7th of September 1533, and, like all the Tudors except Henry VII., at\r\nGreenwich Palace, was the only surviving child of Henry VIII. by his\r\nsecond queen, Anne Boleyn. With such a mother and with Cranmer as her\r\ngodfather she represented from her birth the principle of revolt from\r\nRome, but the opponents of that movement attached little importance to\r\nher advent into the world. Charles V.'s ambassador, Chapuys, hardly\r\ndeigned to mention the fact that the king's _amie_ had given birth to a\r\ndaughter, and both her parents were bitterly disappointed with her sex.\r\nShe was, however, given precedence over Mary, her elder sister by\r\nsixteen years, and Mary never forgave the infant's offence. Even this\r\ndubious advantage only lasted three years until her mother was beheaded,\r\nand by a much more serious freak on Henry's part \"divorced.\" Elizabeth\r\nhas been censured for having made no effort in later years to clear her\r\nmother's memory; but no vindication of Anne's character could have\r\nrehabilitated Elizabeth's legitimacy. Her mother was not \"divorced\" for\r\nher alleged adultery, because that crime was no ground for divorce by\r\nRoman or English canon law. The marriage was declared invalid _ab\r\ninitio_ either on the ground of Anne's precontract with Lord Percy or\r\nmore probably on the ground of the affinity established between Henry\r\nand Anne by Henry's previous relations with Mary Boleyn.\r\n\r\nElizabeth thus lost all hereditary title to the throne, and her early\r\nyears of childhood can hardly have been happier than Mary's. Nor was her\r\nlegitimacy ever legally established; but after Jane Seymour's death,\r\nwhen Henry seemed likely to have no further issue, she was by act of\r\nparliament placed next in order of the succession after Edward and Mary\r\nand their issue; and this statutory arrangement was confirmed by the\r\nwill which Henry VIII. was empowered by statute to make. Queen Catherine\r\nParr introduced some humanity into Henry's household, and Edward and\r\nElizabeth were well and happily educated together, principally at old\r\nHatfield House, which is now the marquess of Salisbury's stables. They\r\nwere there when Henry's death called Edward VI. away to greater\r\ndignities, and Elizabeth was left in the care of Catherine Parr, who\r\nmarried in indecent haste Thomas, Lord Seymour, brother of the protector\r\nSomerset. This unprincipled adventurer, even before Catherine's death in\r\nSeptember 1548, paid indelicate attentions to Elizabeth. Any attempt to\r\nmarry her without the council's leave would have been treason on his\r\npart and would have deprived Elizabeth of her contingent right to the\r\nsuccession. Accordingly, when Seymour's other misbehaviour led to his\r\narrest, his relations with Elizabeth were made the subject of a very\r\ntrying investigation, which gave Elizabeth her first lessons in the\r\nfeminine arts of self-defence. She proved equal to the occasion, partly\r\nbecause she was in all probability innocent of anything worse than a\r\nqualified acquiescence in Seymour's improprieties and a girlish\r\nadmiration for his handsome face. He or his tragic fate may have touched\r\na deeper chord, but it was carefully concealed; and although in later\r\nyears Elizabeth seems to have cherished his memory, and certainly showed\r\nno love for his brother's children, at the time she only showed\r\nresentment at the indignities inflicted on herself.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of Edward's reign Elizabeth's life was less tempestuous.\r\nShe hardly rivalled Lady Jane Grey as the ideal Puritan maiden, but she\r\nswam with the stream, and was regarded as a foil to her stubborn\r\nCatholic sister. She thus avoided the enmity and the still more\r\ndangerous favour of Northumberland; and some unknown history lies behind\r\nthe duke's preference of the Lady Jane to Elizabeth as his son's wife\r\nand his own puppet for the throne. She thus escaped shipwreck in his\r\ncrazy vessel, and rode by Mary's side in triumph into London on the\r\nfailure of the plot. For a time she was safe enough; she would not\r\nrenounce her Protestantism until Catholicism had been made the law of\r\nthe land, but she followed Gardiner's advice to her father when he said\r\nit was better that he should make the law his will than try to make his\r\nwill the law. As a presumptive ruler of England she was, like Cecil, and\r\nfor that matter the future archbishop Parker also, too shrewd to commit\r\nherself to passive or active resistance to the law; and they merely\r\nanticipated Hobbes in holding that the individual committed no sin in\r\nsubordinating his conscience to the will of the state, for the\r\nresponsibility for the law was not his but the state's. Their position\r\nwas well enough understood in those days; it was known that they were\r\nheretics at heart, and that when their turn came they would once more\r\noverthrow Catholicism and expect a similar submission from the\r\nCatholics.\r\n\r\nIt was not so much Elizabeth's religion as her nearness to the throne\r\nand the circumstances of her birth that endangered her life in Mary's\r\nreign. While Mary was popular Elizabeth was safe; but as soon as the\r\nSpanish marriage project had turned away English hearts Elizabeth\r\ninevitably became the centre of plots and the hope of the plotters. Had\r\nnot Lady Jane still been alive to take off the edge of Mary's\r\nindignation and suspicion Elizabeth might have paid forfeit for Wyat's\r\nrebellion with her life instead of imprisonment. She may have had\r\ninterviews with French agents who helped to foment the insurrection; but\r\nshe was strong and wary enough to avoid Henry II.'s, as she had avoided\r\nNorthumberland's, toils; for even in case of success she would have been\r\nthe French king's puppet, placed on the throne, if at all, merely to\r\nkeep it warm for Henry's prospective daughter-in-law, Mary Stuart. This\r\ndid not make Mary Tudor any more friendly, and, although the story that\r\nElizabeth favoured Courtenay and that Mary was jealous is a ridiculous\r\nfiction, the Spaniards cried loud and long for Elizabeth's execution.\r\nShe was sent to the Tower in March 1554, but few Englishmen were fanatic\r\nenough to want a Tudor beheaded. The great nobles, the Howards, and\r\nGardiner would not hear of such a proposal; and all the efforts of the\r\ncourt throughout Mary's reign failed to induce parliament to listen to\r\nthe suggestion that Elizabeth should be deprived of her legal right to\r\nthe succession. After two months in the Tower she was transferred to Sir\r\nHenry Bedingfield's charge at Woodstock, and at Christmas, when the\r\nrealm had been reconciled to Rome and Mary was expecting issue,\r\nElizabeth was once more received at court. In the autumn of 1555 she\r\nwent down to Hatfield, where she spent most of the rest of Mary's reign,\r\nenjoying the lessons of Ascham and Baldassare Castiglione, and planting\r\ntrees which still survive.\r\n\r\nShe had only to bide her time while Mary made straight her successor's\r\npath by uprooting whatever affection the English people had for the\r\nCatholic faith, Roman jurisdiction and Spanish control. The Protestant\r\nmartyrs and Calais between them removed all the alternatives to an\r\ninsular national English policy in church and in state; and no sovereign\r\nwas better qualified to lead such a cause than the queen who ascended\r\nthe throne amid universal, and the Spaniards thought indecent,\r\nrejoicings at Mary's death on the 17th of November 1558. \"Mere English\"\r\nshe boasted of being, and after Englishmen's recent experience there was\r\nno surer title to popular favour. No sovereign since Harold had been so\r\npurely English in blood; her nearest foreign ancestor was Catherine of\r\nFrance, the widow of Henry V., and no English king or queen was more\r\nsuperbly insular in character or in policy. She was the unmistakable\r\nchild of the age so far as Englishmen shared in its characteristics, for\r\nwith her English aims she combined some Italian methods and ideas. \"An\r\nEnglishman Italianate,\" ran the current jingle, \"is a devil incarnate,\"\r\nand Elizabeth was well versed in Italian scholarship and statecraft.\r\nItalians, especially Bernardino Ochino, had given her religious\r\ninstruction, and the Italians who rejected Catholicism usually adopted\r\nfar more advanced forms of heresy than Lutheranism, Zwinglianism, or\r\neven Calvinism. Elizabeth herself patronized Giacomo Acontio, who\r\nthought dogma a \"stratagema Satanae,\" and her last favourite, Essex was\r\naccused of being the ringleader of \"a damnable crew of atheists.\" A\r\nSpanish ambassador early in the reign thought that Elizabeth's own\r\nreligion was equally negative, though she told him she agreed with\r\nnearly everything in the Augsburg Confession. She was probably not at\r\nliberty to say what she really thought, but she made up by saying a\r\ngreat many things which she did not mean. It is clear enough that,\r\nalthough, like her father, she was fond of ritual, she was absolutely\r\ndevoid of the religious temperament, and that her ecclesiastical\r\npreferences were dictated by political considerations. She was sincere\r\nenough in her dislike of Roman jurisdiction and of Calvinism; a daughter\r\nof Anne Boleyn could have little affection for a system which made her a\r\nbastard, and all monarchs agreed at heart with James I.'s aphorism about\r\n\"no bishop, no king.\" It was convenient, too, to profess Lutheran\r\nsympathies, for Lutheranism was now an established, monarchical and\r\ncomparatively respectable religion, very different from the Calvinism\r\nagainst which monarchs directed the Counter-reformation from political\r\nmotives. Lutheran dogma, however, had few adherents in England, though\r\nits political theory coincided with that of Anglicanism in the 16th\r\ncentury. The compromise that resulted from these conflicting forces\r\nsuited Elizabeth very well; she had little dislike of Catholics who\r\nrepudiated the papacy, but she was forced to rely mainly on Protestants,\r\nand had little respect for any form of ecclesiastical self-government.\r\nShe valued uniformity in religion, not as a safeguard against heresy,\r\nbut as a guarantee of the unity of the state. She respected the bishops\r\nonly as supporters of her throne; and, although the well-known letter\r\nbeginning \"Proud Prelate\" is an 18th-century forgery, it is hardly a\r\ntravesty of Elizabeth's attitude.\r\n\r\nThe outlines of her foreign policy are sketched elsewhere (see ENGLISH\r\nHISTORY), and her courtships were diplomatic. Contemporary gossip, which\r\nwas probably justified, said that she was debarred from matrimony by a\r\nphysical defect; and her cry when she heard that Mary queen of Scots had\r\ngiven birth to a son is the most womanly thing recorded of Elizabeth.\r\nHer features were as handsome as Mary's, but she had little fascination,\r\nand in spite of her many suitors no man lost his head over Elizabeth as\r\nmen did over Mary. She was far too masculine in mind and temperament,\r\nand her extravagant addiction to the outward trappings of femininity was\r\nprobably due to the absence or atrophy of deeper feminine instincts. In\r\nthe same way the impossibility of marriage made her all the freer with\r\nher flirtations, and she carried some of them to lengths that\r\nscandalized a public unconscious of Elizabeth's security. She had every\r\nreason to keep them in the dark, and to convince other courts that she\r\ncould and would marry if the provocation were sufficient. She could not\r\nmarry Philip II., but she held out hopes to more than one of his\r\nAustrian cousins whenever France or Mary Stuart seemed to threaten; and\r\nlater she encouraged two French princes when Philip had lost patience\r\nwith Elizabeth and made Mary Stuart his protegee. Her other suitors were\r\nless important, except Leicester, who appealed to the least intellectual\r\nside of Elizabeth and was always a cause of distraction in her policy\r\nand her ministers.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was terribly handicapped by having no heirs of her body and no\r\nobvious English successor. She could not afford to recognize Mary's\r\nclaim, for that would have been to alienate the Protestants, double the\r\nnumber of Catholics, and, in her own phrase, to spread a winding-sheet\r\nbefore her eyes; for all would have turned to the rising sun. Mary was\r\ndangerous enough as it was, and no one would willingly make his rival\r\nhis heir. Elizabeth could hardly be expected to go out of her way and\r\nask parliament to repeal its own acts for Mary's sake; probably it would\r\nhave refused. Nor was it personal enmity on Elizabeth's part that\r\nbrought Mary to the block. Parliament had long been ferociously\r\ndemanding Mary's execution, not because she was guilty but because she\r\nwas dangerous to the public peace. She alone could have given the\r\nSpanish Armada any real chance of success; and as the prospect of\r\ninvasion loomed larger on the horizon, fiercer grew the popular\r\ndetermination to remove the only possible centre of a domestic rising,\r\nwithout which the external attack was bound to be a failure. Elizabeth\r\nresisted the demand, not from compassion or qualms of conscience, but\r\nbecause she dreaded the responsibility for Mary's death. She wished\r\nPaulet would manage the business on his own account, and when at last\r\nher signature was extorted she made a scapegoat of her secretary Davison\r\nwho had the warrant executed.\r\n\r\nThe other great difficulty, apart from the succession, with which\r\nElizabeth had to deal arose from the exuberant aggressiveness of\r\nEngland, which she could not, and perhaps did not want to, repress.\r\nReligion was not really the cause of her external dangers, for the time\r\nhad passed for crusades, and no foreign power seriously contemplated an\r\narmed invasion of England for religion's sake. But no state could long\r\ntolerate the affronts which English seamen offered Spain. The common\r\nview that the British Empire has been won by purely defensive action is\r\nnot tenable, and from the beginning of her reign Englishmen had taken\r\nthe offensive, partly from religious but also from other motives. They\r\nwere determined to break up the Spanish monopoly in the new world, and\r\nin the pursuit of this endeavour they were led to challenge Spain in the\r\nold. For nearly thirty years Philip put up with the capture of his\r\ntreasure-ships, the raiding of his colonies and the open assistance\r\nrendered to his rebels. Only when he had reached the conclusion that his\r\npower would never be secure in the Netherlands or the New World until\r\nEngland was conquered, did he despatch the Spanish Armada. Elizabeth\r\ndelayed the breach as long as she could, probably because she knew that\r\nwar meant taxation, and that taxation was the most prolific parent of\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\nWith the defeat of the Spanish Armada Elizabeth's work was done, and\r\nduring the last fifteen years of her reign she got more out of touch\r\nwith her people. That period was one of gradual transition to the\r\nconditions of Stuart times; during it practically every claim was put\r\nforward that was made under the first two Stuarts either on behalf of\r\nparliament or the prerogative, and Elizabeth's attitude towards the\r\nPuritans was hardly distinguishable from James I.'s. But her past was in\r\nher favour, and so were her sex and her Tudor tact, which checked the\r\ngrowth of discontent and made Essex's rebellion a ridiculous fiasco. He\r\nwas the last and the most wilful but perhaps the best of her favourites,\r\nand his tragic fate deepened the gloom of her closing years. The\r\nloneliness of a queen who had no husband or children and no relatives to\r\nmention must at all times have been oppressive; it grew desolating in\r\nold age after the deaths of Leicester, Walsingham, Burghley and Essex,\r\nand Elizabeth died, the last of her race, on the 24th of March 1603.\r\n\r\n  Bishop Creighton's _Queen Elizabeth_ (1896) is the best biography;\r\n  there are others by E.S. Beesly (_Twelve English Statesmen_, 1892);\r\n  Lucy Aikin, _Memoirs of the Court of Queen Elizabeth_ (1818); and T.\r\n  Wright, _Queen Elizabeth and her Times_ (1838). See also A. Jessopp's\r\n  article in the _Dict. Nat. Biog._     (A. F. P.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH [PETROVNA] (1709-1762), EMPRESS OF RUSSIA, the daughter of\r\nPeter the Great and Martha Skovronskaya, born at Kolomenskoye, near\r\nMoscow, on the 18th of December 1709. Even as a child her parts were\r\ngood, if not brilliant, but unfortunately her education was both\r\nimperfect and desultory. Her father had no leisure to devote to her\r\ntraining, and her mother was too illiterate to superintend her studies.\r\nShe had a French governess, however, and at a later day picked up some\r\nItalian, German and Swedish, and could converse in these languages with\r\nmore fluency than accuracy. From her earliest years she delighted every\r\none by her extraordinary beauty and vivacity. It was Peter's intention\r\nto marry his second daughter to the young French king Louis XV., but the\r\npride of the Bourbons revolted against any such alliance. Other\r\nconnubial speculations foundered on the personal dislike of the princess\r\nfor the various suitors proposed to her, so that on the death of her\r\nmother (May 1727) and the departure to Holstein of her beloved sister\r\nAnne, her only remaining near relation, the princess found herself at\r\nthe age of eighteen practically her own mistress. So long as Menshikov\r\nremained in power, she was treated with liberality and distinction by\r\nthe government of Peter II., but the Dolgorukis, who supplanted\r\nMenshikov and hated the memory of Peter the Great, practically banished\r\nPeter's daughter from court. Elizabeth had inherited her father's\r\nsensual temperament and, being free from all control, abandoned herself\r\nto her appetites without reserve. While still in her teens, she made a\r\nlover of Alexius Shubin, a sergeant in the Semenovsky Guards, and after\r\nhis banishment to Siberia, minus his tongue, by order of the empress\r\nAnne, consoled herself with a handsome young Cossack, Alexius\r\nRazumovski, who, there is good reason to believe, subsequently became\r\nher husband. During the reign of her cousin Anne (1730-1740), Elizabeth\r\neffaced herself as much as possible; but under the regency of Anne\r\nLeopoldovna the course of events compelled the indolent but by no means\r\nincapable beauty to overthrow the existing government. The idea seems to\r\nhave been first suggested to her by the French ambassador, La Chetardie,\r\nwho was plotting to destroy the Austrian influence then dominant at the\r\nRussian court. It is a mistake to suppose, however, that La Chetardie\r\ntook a leading part in the revolution which placed the daughter of Peter\r\nthe Great on the Russian throne. As a matter of fact, beyond lending the\r\ntsesarevna 2000 ducats, instead of the 15,000 she demanded of him, he\r\ntook no part whatever in the actual _coup d'etat_ which was as great a\r\nsurprise to him as to every one else. The merit and glory of that\r\nsingular affair belong to Elizabeth alone. The fear of being imprisoned\r\nin a convent for the rest of her life was the determining cause of her\r\nirresistible outburst of energy. At midnight on the 6th of December\r\n1741, with a few personal friends, including her physician, Armand\r\nLestocq, her chamberlain, Michael Ilarionvich Vorontsov, her future\r\nhusband, Alexius Razumovski, and Alexander and Peter Shuvalov, two of\r\nthe gentlemen of her household, she drove to the barracks of the\r\nPreobrazhensky Guards, enlisted their sympathies by a stirring speech,\r\nand led them to the Winter Palace, where the regent was reposing in\r\nabsolute security. Having on the way thither had all the ministers\r\narrested, she seized the regent and her children in their beds, and\r\nsummoned all the notables, civil and ecclesiastical, to her presence. So\r\nswiftly and noiselessly indeed had the whole revolution proceeded that\r\nas late as eight o'clock the next morning very few people in the city\r\nwere aware of it. Thus, at the age of three-and-thirty, this naturally\r\nindolent and self-indulgent woman, with little knowledge and no\r\nexperience of affairs, suddenly found herself at the head of a great\r\nempire at one of the most critical periods of its existence. Fortunately\r\nfor herself, and for Russia, Elizabeth Petrovna, with all her\r\nshortcomings, had inherited some of her father's genius for government.\r\nHer usually keen judgment and her diplomatic tact again and again recall\r\nPeter the Great. What in her sometimes seemed irresolution and\r\nprocrastination, was, most often, a wise suspense of judgment under\r\nexceptionally difficult circumstances; and to this may be added that she\r\nwas ever ready to sacrifice the prejudices of the woman to the duty of\r\nthe sovereign.\r\n\r\nAfter abolishing the cabinet council system in favour during the rule of\r\nthe two Annes, and reconstituting the senate as it had been under Peter\r\nthe Great,--with the chiefs of the departments of state, all of them now\r\nRussians again, as _ex-officio_ members under the presidency of the\r\nsovereign,--the first care of the new empress was to compose her quarrel\r\nwith Sweden. On the 23rd of January 1743, direct negotiations between\r\nthe two powers were opened at Abo, and on the 7th of August 1743 Sweden\r\nceded to Russia all the southern part of Finland east of the river\r\nKymmene, which thus became the boundary between the two states,\r\nincluding the fortresses of Villmanstrand and Fredrikshamn. This\r\ntriumphant issue was mainly due to the diplomatic ability of the new\r\nvice chancellor, Alexius Bestuzhev-Ryumin (q.v.), whom Elizabeth, much\r\nas she disliked him personally, had wisely placed at the head of foreign\r\naffairs immediately after her accession. He represented the\r\nanti-Franco-Prussian portion of her council, and his object was to bring\r\nabout an Anglo-Austro-Russian alliance which, at that time, was\r\nundoubtedly Russia's proper system. Hence the reiterated attempts of\r\nFrederick the Great and Louis XV. to get rid of Bestuzhev, which made\r\nthe Russian court during the earlier years of Elizabeth's reign the\r\ncentre of a tangle of intrigue impossible to unravel by those who do\r\nnot possess the clue to it (see BESTUZHEV-RYUMIN, ALEXIUS). Ultimately,\r\nhowever, the minister, strong in the support of Elizabeth, prevailed,\r\nand his faultless diplomacy, backed by the despatch of an auxiliary\r\nRussian corps of 30,000 men to the Rhine, greatly accelerated the peace\r\nnegotiations which led to the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (October 18,\r\n1748). By sheer tenacity of purpose, Bestuzhev had extricated his\r\ncountry from the Swedish imbroglio; reconciled his imperial mistress\r\nwith the courts of Vienna and London, her natural allies; enabled Russia\r\nto assert herself effectually in Poland, Turkey and Sweden, and isolated\r\nthe restless king of Prussia by environing him with hostile alliances.\r\nBut all this would have been impossible but for the steady support of\r\nElizabeth, who trusted him implicitly, despite the insinuations of the\r\nchancellor's innumerable enemies, most of whom were her personal\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe great event of Elizabeth's later years was the Seven Years' War.\r\nElizabeth rightly regarded the treaty of Westminster (January 16, 1756,\r\nwhereby Great Britain and Prussia agreed to unite their forces to oppose\r\nthe entry into, or the passage through, Germany of the troops of every\r\nforeign power) as utterly subversive of the previous conventions between\r\nGreat Britain and Russia. A by no means unwarrantable fear of the king\r\nof Prussia, who was \"to be reduced within proper limits,\" so that \"he\r\nmight be no longer a danger to the empire,\" induced Elizabeth to accede\r\nto the treaty of Versailles, in other words the Franco-Austrian league\r\nagainst Prussia, and on the 17th of May 1757 the Russian army, 85,000\r\nstrong, advanced against Konigsberg. Neither the serious illness of the\r\nempress, which began with a fainting-fit at Tsarskoe Selo (September 19,\r\n1757), nor the fall of Bestuzhev (February 21, 1758), nor the cabals and\r\nintrigues of the various foreign powers at St Petersburg, interfered\r\nwith the progress of the war, and the crushing defeat of Kunersdorf\r\n(August 12, 1759) at last brought Frederick to the verge of ruin. From\r\nthat day forth he despaired of success, though he was saved for the\r\nmoment by the jealousies of the Russian and Austrian commanders, which\r\nruined the military plans of the allies. On the other hand, it is not\r\ntoo much to say that, from the end of 1759 to the end of 1761, the\r\nunshakable firmness of the Russian empress was the one constraining\r\npolitical force which held together the heterogeneous, incessantly\r\njarring elements of the anti-Prussian combination. From the Russian\r\npoint of view, Elizabeth's greatness as a statesman consists in her\r\nsteady appreciation of Russian interests, and her determination to\r\npromote them at all hazards. She insisted throughout that the king of\r\nPrussia must be rendered harmless to his neighbours for the future, and\r\nthat the only way to bring this about was to reduce him to the rank of\r\nan elector. Frederick himself was quite alive to his danger. \"I am at\r\nthe end of my resources,\" he wrote at the beginning of 1760, \"the\r\ncontinuance of this war means for me utter ruin. Things may drag on\r\nperhaps till July, but then a catastrophe _must_ come.\" On the 21st of\r\nMay 1760 a fresh convention was signed between Russia and Austria, a\r\nsecret clause of which, never communicated to the court of Versailles,\r\nguaranteed East Prussia to Russia, as an indemnity for war expenses. The\r\nfailure of the campaign of 1760, so far as Russia and France were\r\nconcerned, induced the court of Versailles, on the evening of the 22nd\r\nof January 1761, to present to the court of St Petersburg a despatch to\r\nthe effect that the king of France by reason of the condition of his\r\ndominions absolutely desired peace. On the following day the Austrian\r\nambassador, Esterhazy, presented a despatch of a similar tenor from his\r\ncourt. The Russian empress's reply was delivered to the two ambassadors\r\non the 12th of February. It was inspired by the most uncompromising\r\nhostility towards the king of Prussia. Elizabeth would not consent to\r\nany pacific overtures until the original object of the league had been\r\naccomplished. Simultaneously, Elizabeth caused to be conveyed to Louis\r\nXV. a confidential letter in which she proposed the signature of a new\r\ntreaty of alliance of a more comprehensive and explicit nature than the\r\npreceding treaties between the two powers, without the knowledge of\r\nAustria. Elizabeth's object in this mysterious negotiation seems to\r\nhave been to reconcile France and Great Britain, in return for which\r\nsignal service France was to throw all her forces into the German war.\r\nThis project, which lacked neither ability nor audacity, foundered upon\r\nLouis XV.'s invincible jealousy of the growth of Russian influence in\r\neastern Europe and his fear of offending the Porte. It was finally\r\narranged by the allies that their envoys at Paris should fix the date\r\nfor the assembling of a peace congress, and that, in the meantime, the\r\nwar against Prussia should be vigorously prosecuted. The campaign of\r\n1761 was almost as abortive as the campaign of 1760. Frederick acted on\r\nthe defensive with consummate skill, and the capture of the Prussian\r\nfortress of Kolberg on Christmas day O.S. 1761, by Rumyantsev, was the\r\nsole Russian success. Frederick, however, was now at the last gasp. On\r\nthe 6th of January 1762, he wrote to Finkenstein, \"We ought now to think\r\nof preserving for my nephew, by way of negotiation, whatever fragments\r\nof my territory we can save from the avidity of my enemies,\" which\r\nmeans, if words mean anything, that he was resolved to seek a soldier's\r\ndeath on the first opportunity. A fortnight later he wrote to Prince\r\nFerdinand of Brunswick, \"The sky begins to clear. Courage, my dear\r\nfellow. I have received the news of a great event.\" The great event\r\nwhich snatched him from destruction was the death of the Russian empress\r\n(January 5, 1762).\r\n\r\n  See Robert Nisbet Bain, _The Daughter of Peter the Great_ (London,\r\n  1899); Sergyei Solovev, _History of Russia_ (Rus.), vols. xx.-xxii.\r\n  (St Petersburg, 1857-1877); _Politische Correspondenz Friedrichs des\r\n  Grossen_, vols. i.-xxi.

N. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH [AMELIE EUGENIE] (1837-1898), consort of Francis Joseph,\r\nemperor of Austria and king of Hungary, was the daughter of Duke\r\nMaximilian Joseph of Bavaria and Louisa Wilhelmina, daughter of\r\nMaximilian I. of Bavaria, and was born on the 24th of December 1837 at\r\nthe castle of Possenhofen on Lake Starnberg. She inherited the quick\r\nintelligence and artistic taste displayed in general by members of the\r\nWittelsbach royal house, and her education was the reverse of\r\nconventional. She accompanied her eccentric father on his hunting\r\nexpeditions, becoming an expert rider and climber, visiting the peasants\r\nin their huts and sharing in rustic pleasures. The emperor of Austria,\r\nFrancis Joseph, met the Bavarian ducal family at Ischl in August 1853,\r\nand immediately fell in love with Elizabeth, then a girl of sixteen, and\r\nreported to be the most beautiful princess in Europe. The marriage took\r\nplace in Vienna on the 24th of April 1854. In the early days of her\r\nmarried life she frequently came into collision with Viennese prejudice.\r\nHer attempts to modify court etiquette, and her extreme fondness for\r\nhorsemanship and frequent visits to the imperial riding school,\r\nscandalized Austrian society, while her predilection for Hungary and for\r\neverything Hungarian offended German sentiment. There is no doubt that\r\nher influence helped the establishment of the _Ausgleich_ with Hungary,\r\nbut outside Hungarian affairs the empress took small part in politics.\r\nShe first visited Hungary in 1857, and ten years later was crowned\r\nqueen. Her popularity with the Hungarians remained unchanged throughout\r\nher life; and the castle of Godollo, presented as a coronation gift, was\r\none of her favourite residences. Elizabeth was one of the most\r\ncharitable of royal ladies, and her popularity with her Austrian\r\nsubjects was more than restored by her assiduous care for the wounded in\r\nthe campaign of 1866. Besides her public benefactions she constantly\r\nexercised personal and private charity. Her eldest daughter died in\r\ninfancy; Gisela (b. 1856) married the Prince Leopold of Bavaria; and her\r\nyoungest daughter Marie Valerie (b. 1868) married the Archduke Franz\r\nSalvator. The tragic death of her only son, the crown prince Rudolph, in\r\n1889, was a shock from which she never really recovered. She was also\r\ndeeply affected by the suicide of her cousin Louis II. of Bavaria, and\r\nagain by the fate of her sister Sophia, duchess of Alencon, who perished\r\nin the fire of the Paris charity bazaar in 1897. The empress had shown\r\nsigns of lung disease in 1861, when she spent some months in Madeira;\r\nbut she was able to resume her outdoor sports, and for some years\r\nbefore 1882, when she had to give up riding, was a frequent visitor on\r\nEnglish and Irish hunting fields. In her later years her dislike of\r\npublicity increased. Much of her time was spent in travel or at the\r\nAchilleion, the palace she had built in the Greek style in Corfu. She\r\nwas walking from her hotel at Geneva to the steamer when she was stabbed\r\nby the anarchist Luigi Luccheni, on the 10th of September 1898, and died\r\nof the wound within a few hours. This aimless and dastardly crime\r\ncompleted the list of misfortunes of the Austrian house, and aroused\r\nintense indignation throughout Europe.\r\n\r\n  See A. de Burgh, _Elizabeth, Empress of Austria, a Memoir_ (London,\r\n  1898); E. Friedmann and J. Paves, _Kaiserin Elisabeth_ (Berlin, 1898);\r\n  and the anonymous _Martyrdom of an Empress_ (1899), containing a\r\n  quantity of court gossip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH (1596-1662), consort of Frederick V., elector palatine and\r\ntitular king of Bohemia, was the eldest daughter of James I. of Great\r\nBritain and of Anne of Denmark, and was born at Falkland Castle in\r\nFifeshire in August 1596. She was entrusted to the care of the earl of\r\nLinlithgow, and after the departure of the royal family to England, to\r\nthe countess of Kildare, subsequently residing with Lord and Lady\r\nHarington at Combe Abbey in Warwickshire. In November 1605 the Gunpowder\r\nPlot conspirators formed a plan to seize her person and proclaim her\r\nqueen after the explosion, in consequence of which she was removed by\r\nLord Harington to Coventry. In 1608 she appeared at court, where her\r\nbeauty soon attracted admiration and became the theme of the poets, her\r\nsuitors including the dauphin, Maurice, prince of Orange, Gustavus\r\nAdolphus, Philip III. of Spain, and Frederick V., the elector palatine.\r\nA union with the last-named was finally arranged, in spite of the\r\nqueen's opposition, in order to strengthen the alliance with the\r\nProtestant powers in Germany, and the marriage took place on the 14th of\r\nFebruary 1613 midst great rejoicing and festivities. The prince and\r\nprincess entered Heidelberg on the 17th of June, and Elizabeth, by means\r\nof her English annuity, enjoyed five years of pleasure and of\r\nextravagant gaiety to which the small German court was totally\r\nunaccustomed. On the 26th of August 1618, Frederick, as a leading\r\nProtestant prince, was chosen king by the Bohemians, who deposed the\r\nemperor Ferdinand, then archduke of Styria. There is no evidence to show\r\nthat his acceptance was instigated by the princess or that she had any\r\ninfluence in her husband's political career. She accompanied Frederick\r\nto Prague in October 1619, and was crowned on the 7th of November. Here\r\nher unrestrainable high spirits and levity gave great offence to the\r\ncitizens. On the approach of misfortune, however, she showed great\r\ncourage and fortitude. She left Prague on the 8th of November 1620,\r\nafter the fatal battle of the White Hill, for Kustrin, travelling thence\r\nto Berlin and Wolfenbuttel, finally with Frederick taking refuge at the\r\nHague with Prince Maurice of Orange. The help sought from James came\r\nonly in the shape of useless embassies and negotiations; the two\r\nPalatinates were soon occupied by the Spaniards and the duke of Bavaria;\r\nand the romantic attachment and services of Duke Christian of Brunswick,\r\nof the 1st earl of Craven, and of other chivalrous young champions who\r\nwere inspired by the beauty and grace of the \"Queen of Hearts,\" as\r\nElizabeth was now called, availed nothing. Her residence was at Rhenen\r\nnear Arnheim, where she received many English visitors and endeavoured\r\nto maintain her spirits and fortitude, with straitened means and in\r\nspite of frequent disappointments. The victories of Gustavus Adolphus\r\nsecured no permanent advantage, and his death at Lutzen was followed by\r\nthat of the elector at Mainz on the 29th of November 1632. Subsequent\r\nattempts of the princess to reinstate her son in his dominions were\r\nunsuccessful, and it was not till the peace of Westphalia in 1648 that\r\nhe regained a portion of them, the Rhenish Palatinate. Meanwhile,\r\nElizabeth's position in Holland grew more and more unsatisfactory. The\r\npayment of her English annuity of L12,000 ceased after the outbreak of\r\nthe troubles with the parliament; the death of Charles I. in 1649 put an\r\nend to all hopes from that quarter; and the pension allowed her by the\r\nhouse of Orange ceased in 1650. Her children, in consequence of\r\ndisputes, abandoned her, and her eldest son Charles Louis refused her a\r\nhome in his restored electorate. Nor did Charles II. at his restoration\r\nshow any desire to receive her in England. Parliament voted her L20,000\r\nin 1660 for the payment of her debts, but Elizabeth did not receive the\r\nmoney, and on the 19th of May 1661 she left the Hague for England, in\r\nspite of the king's attempts to hinder her journey, receiving no\r\nofficial welcome on her arrival in London and being lodged at Lord\r\nCraven's house in Drury Lane. Charles, however, subsequently granted her\r\na pension and treated her with kindness. On the 8th of February 1662 she\r\nremoved to Leicester House in Leicester Fields, and died shortly\r\nafterwards on the 13th of the same month, being buried in Westminster\r\nAbbey. Her beauty, grace and vivacity exercised a great charm over her\r\ncontemporaries, the enthusiasm for her, however, being probably not\r\nmerely personal but one inspired also by her misfortunes and by the fact\r\nthat these misfortunes were incurred in defence of the Protestant cause;\r\nlater, as the ancestress of the Protestant Hanoverian dynasty, she\r\nobtained a conspicuous place in English history. She had thirteen\r\nchildren--Frederick Henry, drowned at sea in 1629; Charles Louis,\r\nelector palatine, whose daughter married Philip, duke of Orleans, and\r\nbecame the ancestress of the elder and Roman Catholic branch of the\r\nroyal family of England; Elizabeth, abbess and friend of Descartes;\r\nPrince Rupert and Prince Maurice, who died unmarried; Louisa, abbess;\r\nEdward, who married Anne de Gonzaga, \"princesse palatine,\" and had\r\nchildren; Henrietta Maria, who married Count Sigismund Ragotzki but died\r\nchildless; Philip and Charlotte, who died childless; Sophia, who married\r\nErnest Augustus, elector of Hanover, and was mother of George I. of\r\nEngland; and two others who died young.\r\n\r\n  Bibliography.--See the article in _Dict. of Nat.

(q.v.) of Rumania, widely known by her literary name of\r\n\"Carmen Sylva,\" was born on the 29th of December 1843. She was the\r\ndaughter of Prince Hermann of Neuwied. She first met the future king of\r\nRumania at Berlin in 1861, and was married to him on the 15th of\r\nNovember 1869. Her only child, a daughter, died in 1874. In the\r\nRusso-Turkish War of 1877-1878 she devoted herself to the care of the\r\nwounded, and founded the Order of Elizabeth (a gold cross on a blue\r\nribbon) to reward distinguished service in such work. She fostered the\r\nhigher education of women in Rumania, and established societies for\r\nvarious charitable objects. Early distinguished by her excellence as a\r\npianist, organist and singer, she also showed considerable ability in\r\npainting and illuminating; but a lively poetic imagination led her to\r\nthe path of literature, and more especially to poetry, folk-lore and\r\nballads. In addition to numerous original works she put into literary\r\nform many of the legends current among the Rumanian peasantry.\r\n\r\n\"Carmen Sylva\" wrote with facility in German, Rumanian, French and\r\nEnglish. A few of her voluminous writings, which include poems, plays,\r\nnovels, short stories, essays, collections of aphorisms, &c., may be\r\nsingled out for special mention. Her earliest publications were _Sappho_\r\nand _Hammerstein_, two poems which appeared at Leipzig in 1880. In 1888\r\nshe received the Prix Botta, a prize awarded triennially by the French\r\nAcademy, for her volume of prose aphorisms _Les Pensees d'une reine_\r\n(Paris, 1882), a German version of which is entitled _Vom Amboss_ (Bonn,\r\n1890). _Cuvinte Sufletesci_, religious meditations in Rumanian\r\n(Bucharest, 1888), was also translated into German (Bonn, 1890), under\r\nthe name of _Seelen-Gesprache_. Several of the works of \"Carmen Sylva\"\r\nwere written in collaboration with Mite Kremnitz, one of her maids of\r\nhonour, who was born at Greifswald in 1857, and married Dr Kremnitz of\r\nBucharest; these were published between 1881 and 1888, in some cases\r\nunder the pseudonyms _Dito et Idem_, and includes the novel _Aus zwei\r\nWelten_ (Leipzig, 1884), _Anna Boleyn_ (Bonn, 1886), a tragedy, _In der\r\nIrre_ (Bonn, 1888), a collection of short stories, &c. _Edleen Vaughan,\r\nor Paths of Peril_, a novel (London, 1894), and _Sweet Hours_, poems\r\n(London, 1904), were written in English. Among the translations made by\r\n\"Carmen Sylva\" are German versions of Pierre Loti's romance _Pecheur\r\nd'Islande_, and of Paul de St Victor's dramatic criticisms _Les Deux\r\nMasques_ (Paris, 1881-1884); and in particular _The Bard of the\r\nDimbovitza_, a fine English version by \"Carmen Sylva\" and Alma Strettell\r\nof Helene Vacarescu's collection of Rumanian folk-songs, &c., entitled\r\n_Lieder aus dem Dimbovitzathal_ (Bonn, 1889). _The Bard of the\r\nDimbovitza_ was first published in 1891, and was soon reissued and\r\nexpanded. Translations from the original works of \"Carmen Sylva\" have\r\nappeared in all the principal languages of Europe and in Armenian.\r\n\r\n  See RUMANIA: _History_; also M. Kremnitz, _Carmen Sylva--eine\r\n  Biographie_ (Leipzig, 1903); and, for a full bibliography, G.\r\n  Bengescu, _Carmen Sylva--bibliographie et extraits de ses oeuvres_\r\n  (Paris, 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH (1635-1650), English princess, second daughter of Charles I.,\r\nwas born on the 28th of December 1635 at St James's Palace. On the\r\noutbreak of the Civil War and the departure of the king from London,\r\nwhile the two elder princes accompanied their father, the princess and\r\nthe infant duke of Gloucester were left under the care of the\r\nparliament. In October 1642 Elizabeth sent a letter to the House of\r\nLords begging that her old attendants might not be removed. In July 1644\r\nthe royal children were sent to Sir John Danvers at Chelsea, and in 1645\r\nto the earl and countess of Northumberland. After the final defeat of\r\nthe king they were joined in 1646 by James, and during 1647 paid several\r\nvisits to the king at Caversham, near Reading, and Hampton Court, but\r\nwere again separated by Charles's imprisonment at Carisbrooke Castle. On\r\nthe 21st of April 1648 James was persuaded to escape by Elizabeth, who\r\ndeclared that were she a boy she would not long remain in confinement.\r\nThe last sad meeting between Charles and his two children, at which the\r\nprincess was overcome with grief, and of which she wrote a short and\r\ntouching account, took place on the 29th of January 1649, the day before\r\nhis execution. In June she was entrusted to the care of the earl and\r\ncountess of Leicester at Penshurst, but in 1650, upon the landing of\r\nCharles II. in Scotland, the parliament ordered the royal children to be\r\ntaken for security to Carisbrooke Castle. The princess fell ill from a\r\nwetting almost immediately upon her arrival, and died of fever on the\r\n8th of September. She was buried in St Thomas's church at Newport, Isle\r\nof Wight, where the initials \"E.S.\" alone marked her grave till 1856,\r\nwhen a monument was erected to her memory by Queen Victoria. The\r\nprincess's sorrowful career and early death have attracted general\r\ninterest and sympathy. She was said to have acquired considerable\r\nproficiency in Greek, Hebrew and Latin, as well as in Italian and\r\nFrench, and several books were dedicated to her, including the\r\ntranslation of the _Electra_ of Sophocles by Christopher Wase in 1649.\r\nHer mild nature and gentleness towards her father's enemies gained her\r\nthe name of \"Temperance.\"\r\n\r\n  See _Lives of the Princesses of England_, by M.A.E. Green (1855), vol.\r\n  vi.; _Notes and Queries_, 7th ser., ix. 444, x. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH [Elisabeth Philippine Marie Helene of France] (1764-1794),\r\ncommonly called MADAME ELIZABETH, daughter of Louis the Dauphin and\r\nMarie Josephine of Saxony, and sister of Louis XVI., was born at\r\nVersailles on the 3rd of May 1764. Left an orphan at the age of three,\r\nshe was brought up by Madame de Mackau, and had a residence at\r\nMontreuil, where she gave many proofs of her benevolent character. She\r\nrefused all offers of marriage so that she might remain by the side of\r\nher brother, whom she loved passionately. At the outset of the\r\nRevolution she foresaw the gravity of events, and refused to leave the\r\nking, whom she accompanied in his flight on the 20th of June 1792, and\r\nwith whom she was arrested at Varennes. She was present at the\r\nLegislative Assembly when Louis was suspended, and was imprisoned in the\r\nTemple with the royal family. By the execution of the king and the\r\nremoval of Marie Antoinette to the Conciergerie, Madame Elizabeth was\r\ndeprived of her companions in the Temple prison, and on the 9th of May\r\n1794 she was herself transferred to the Conciergerie, and haled before\r\nthe revolutionary tribunal. Accused of assisting the king's flight, of\r\nsupplying _emigres_ with funds, and of encouraging the resistance of the\r\nroyal troops on the 10th of August 1792, she was condemned to death, and\r\nexecuted on the 10th of May 1794. Like her brother, she had all the\r\ndomestic virtues, and, as was to be expected of a sister of Louis XVI.,\r\nshe was in favour of absolutist principles. Hers was one of the most\r\ntouching tragedies of the Revolution; she perished because she was the\r\nsister of the king.\r\n\r\n  The _Memoires de Madame Elisabeth_ (Paris, 1858), by F. de Barghon and\r\n  Fort-Rion, are of doubtful authenticity; and the collection of letters\r\n  and documents published in 1865 by F. Feuillet de Conches must be used\r\n  with caution (see the bibliographical note to the article MARIE\r\n  ANTOINETTE). See le Comte A.F.C. Ferrand, _Eloge historique de Madame\r\n  Elisabeth_ (1814, containing 94 letters; 2nd ed., 1861, containing\r\n  additional letters, but correspondence mutilated); Du Fresne de\r\n  Beaucourt, _Etude sur Madame Elisabeth_ (Paris, 1864); A. de\r\n  Beauchesne, _Vie de Madame Elisabeth_ (1869); La comtesse d'Armaille,\r\n  _Madame Elisabeth_ (Paris, 1886); Madame d'Arvor, _Madame Elisabeth_\r\n  (Paris, 1898); and Hon. Mrs Maxwell-Scott, _Madame Elizabeth of\r\n  France_ (1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH, SAINT (1207-1231), daughter of Andrew II., king of Hungary\r\n(d. 1235), by his first wife, Gertrude of Andechs-Meran (d. 1213), was\r\nborn in Pressburg in 1207. At four years of age she was betrothed to\r\nLouis IV., landgrave of Thuringia, and conducted to the Wartburg, near\r\nEisenach, to be educated under the direction of his parents. In spite of\r\nher decidedly worldly surroundings at the Thuringian court, she evinced\r\nfrom the first an aversion from even the most innocent pleasures, and\r\nstimulated by the example of her mother's sister, St Hedwig, wife of\r\nHenry VI., duke of Silesia-Breslau, devoted her whole time to religion\r\nand to works of charity. She was married at the age of fourteen, and\r\nacquired such influence over her husband that he adopted her point of\r\nview and zealously assisted her in all her charitable endeavours.\r\nAccording to the legend, much celebrated in German art, Louis at first\r\ndesired to curtail her excessive charities, and forbade her unbounded\r\ngifts to the poor. One day, returning from hunting, he met his wife\r\ndescending from the Wartburg with a heavy bundle filled with bread. He\r\nsternly bade her open it; she did so, and he saw nothing but a mass of\r\nred roses. The miracle completed his conversion. On the death of Louis\r\n\"the Saint\" in 1227, Elizabeth was deprived of the regency by his\r\nbrother, Henry Raspe IV. (d. 1247), on the pretext that she was wasting\r\nthe estates by her alms; and with her three infant children she was\r\ndriven from her home without being allowed to carry with her even the\r\nbarest necessaries of life. She lived for some time in great hardship,\r\nbut ultimately her maternal uncle, Egbert, bishop of Bamberg, offered\r\nher an asylum in a house adjoining his palace. Through the intercession\r\nof some of the principal barons, the regency was again offered her, and\r\nher son Hermann was declared heir to the landgraviate; but renouncing\r\nall power, and making use of her wealth only for charitable purposes,\r\nshe preferred to live in seclusion at Marburg under the direction of her\r\nconfessor, the bigoted persecutor Conrad of Marburg. There she spent the\r\nremainder of her days in penances of unusual severity, and in\r\nministrations to the sick, especially those afflicted with the most\r\nloathsome diseases. She died at Marburg on the 19th of November 1231,\r\nand four years afterwards was canonized by Gregory IX. on account of the\r\nfrequent miracles reported to have been performed at her tomb.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition in the Royal Academy of P.H. Calderon's picture, \"St\r\nElizabeth of Hungary's Great Act of Renunciation,\" now in the Tate\r\nGallery in London, roused considerable protest among Catholics. The\r\nsaint is represented as kneeling nude before the altar, in the presence\r\nof her confessor and a couple of nuns. The passage this is intended to\r\nillustrate is in Lib. iv. S 1 of Dietrich of Apolda's _Vita_, which\r\nrelates how, on a certain Good Friday, she went into a chapel and, in\r\nthe presence of some Franciscan brothers, laid her hands on the bare\r\naltar, renounced her own will, her parents, children, relations, and all\r\npomps of this kind (_hujus modi_) in imitation of Christ; and stripped\r\nherself utterly naked (_omnino se exuit et nudavit_) in order to follow\r\nHim naked, in the steps of poverty. A literal interpretation of this\r\npassage is not impossible; for ecstatic mystics of all ages have\r\nindulged in a like [Greek: kenosis], and Conrad, who revelled in\r\ninflicting religious tortures, was quite capable of imposing this\r\ncrowning humiliation upon his gentle victim. It is far more probable,\r\nhowever, that the passage is not to be taken literally.\r\n\r\n  Lives of St Elizabeth were written by Theodoricus (Dietrich) of Apolda\r\n  (b. 1228), Caesarius of Heisterbach (d. c. 1240), Conrad of Marburg\r\n  and others (see Potthast, _Bibl. Hist. Med. Aev._ p. 1284). A metrical\r\n  life in German exists by Johann Rothe (d. c. 1440), chaplain to the\r\n  Landgravine Anne of Thuringia (Potthast, p. 985). _L'Histoire de\r\n  Sainte Elisabeth de Hongrie_, by Montalembert, was published at Paris\r\n  in 1836. Her life has also supplied the materials for a dramatic poem\r\n  by Charles Kingsley, entitled the \"Saint's Tragedy.\" The edition of\r\n  this in vol. xvi. of the _Life and Works of Charles Kingsley_ (London,\r\n  1902) has valuable notes, with many extracts from the original\r\n  sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH, a city and the county-seat of Union county, New Jersey,\r\nU.S.A., on Elizabeth river, Newark Bay, and Arthur Kill, 10 m. S.W. of\r\nJersey City. Pop. (1890) 37,764; (1900) 52,130, of whom 14,770 were\r\nforeign-born and 1139 were negroes; (1910 census) 73,409. It is served\r\nby the Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Valley and the Central of New Jersey\r\nrailways. The site is level and the streets are broad and shaded. There\r\nare many residences of New York business men, and several historic\r\nbuildings, including Liberty Hall, the mansion of William Livingston,\r\nfirst governor of the state; Boxwood Hall (now used as a home for aged\r\nwomen), the former home of Elias Boudinot; the old brick mansion of\r\nJonathan Belcher (1681-1757), governor of the province from 1747 to\r\n1757; the First Presbyterian Church; and the house occupied at different\r\ntimes by General Winfield Scott. The city has several parks, the Union\r\ncounty court house (1905), a public library and several charitable\r\ninstitutions. Elizabethport, that part of the city on Staten Island\r\nSound, about 2 m. S.E. of the centre of Elizabeth, has a port open to\r\nvessels of 300 tons; it is an outlet of the Pennsylvania coal fields and\r\nis thus one of the most important coal shipping depots in the United\r\nStates. Here, too, are a plant (covering more than 800 acres) of the\r\nStandard Oil Company and a large establishment for the manufacture of\r\nthe \"Singer\" sewing machine--according to the U.S. census the largest\r\nmanufactory of sewing machines in the world--employing more than 6000\r\nworkmen in 1905; among the other manufactures of Elizabeth are foundry\r\nand machine shop products (value in 1905, $3,887,139), wire, oil (value\r\nin 1905, $2,387,656), refined and smelted copper, the output of railway\r\nrepair shops, edge tools and lager beer. The value of the manufactured\r\nproducts was $10,489,364 in 1890; $22,861,375 (factory product) in 1900;\r\nand $29,300,801 (factory product) in 1905.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was settled in 1665 by a company from Long Island for whom the\r\nland had been purchased from the Indians and a grant had been obtained\r\nfrom Richard Nicolls as agent for the duke of York. But about the same\r\ntime the duke conveyed the entire province to John, Lord Berkeley, and\r\nSir George Carteret, and these two conflicting grants gave rise to a\r\nlong-continued controversy (see NEW JERSEY). The town was named in\r\nhonour of Elizabeth, wife of Sir George Carteret, and was first known as\r\nElizabethtown. From 1665 to 1686 it was the seat of government of the\r\nprovince, and the legislature sat here occasionally until 1790. In the\r\nhome of the Rev. Jonathan Dickinson (1688-1747), its first president,\r\nthe first sessions of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton\r\nUniversity) were held in 1747, but immediately afterwards the college\r\nremoved to Newark. In December 1776 and twice in June 1780 the British\r\nentered Elizabeth and made it a base of operations, but on each occasion\r\nthey were soon driven out. Elizabeth became a \"free town and borough\" in\r\n1739; the borough charter was confirmed by the legislature in 1789 and\r\nrepealed in 1790, and Elizabeth was chartered as a city in 1855.\r\n\r\n  See E.F. Hatfield, _History of Elizabeth, New Jersey_ (New York,\r\n  1868).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETHAN STYLE, in architecture, the term given to the early\r\nRenaissance style in England, which flourished chiefly during the reign\r\nof Queen Elizabeth; it followed the Tudor style, and was succeeded in\r\nthe beginning of the 16th century by the purer Italian style introduced\r\nby Inigo Jones. It responds to the Cinque-Cento period in Italy, the\r\nFrancois I. style in France, and the Plateresque or Silversmith's style\r\nin Spain. During the reigns of Henry VIII. and Edward VI. many Italian\r\nartists came over, who carried out various decorative features at\r\nHampton Court; Layer Marney, Suffolk (1522-1525); Sutton Place, Surrey\r\n(1529); Nonsuch Palace and elsewhere. Later in the century Flemish\r\ncraftsmen succeeded the Italians, and the Royal Exchange in London\r\n(1566-1570) is one of the first important buildings designed by Henri de\r\nPaschen, an architect from Antwerp. Longford Castle, Wollaton, Hatfield,\r\nBlickling, Audley End, and Charterhouse (London) all show the style\r\nintroduced by Flemish workmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH CITY, a town, port of entry and the county-seat of Pasquotank\r\ncounty, North Carolina, U.S.A., on the Pasquotank river, at the head of\r\nnavigation, 46 m. S. by E. of Norfolk, Virginia. Pop. (1890) 3251;\r\n(1900) 6348 (3164 negroes); (1910) 8412. It is served by the Norfolk &\r\nSouthern, and the Suffolk & Carolina railways, and is on the Dismal\r\nSwamp and Albemarle & Chesapeake canals. Elizabeth City is a winter\r\nmeeting-place for hunters. It is the seat of a state normal school for\r\nnegroes and of the Atlantic Collegiate Institute, is a trucking centre,\r\nhas shipyards, and has a large wholesale trade in clothing, groceries\r\nand general merchandise; from it are shipped considerable quantities of\r\nfish, cotton and lumber. The town is the port of entry of the Albemarle\r\ncustoms district, but its foreign trade is unimportant. Among its\r\nmanufactures are cotton goods, iron, lumber, nets and twine, bricks, and\r\ncarriages and wagons. The oyster fisheries in the vicinity are of\r\nconsiderable importance. Elizabeth City was settled in 1793, and was\r\nfirst incorporated in the same year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELK, or MOOSE, the largest of all the deer tribe, distinguished from\r\nother members of the _Cervidae_ by the form of the antlers of the males.\r\nThese arise as cylindrical beams projecting on each side at right angles\r\nto the middle line of the skull, which after a short distance divide in\r\na fork-like manner. The lower prong of this fork may be either simple,\r\nor divided into two or three tines, with some flattening. In the East\r\nSiberian elk (_Alces machlis bedfordiae_) the posterior division of the\r\nmain fork divides into three tines, with no distinct flattening. In the\r\ncommon elk (_A. machlis_ or _A. alces_), on the other hand, this branch\r\nusually expands into a broad palmation, with one large tine at the base,\r\nand a number of smaller snags on the free border; there is, however, a\r\nphase of the Scandinavian elk in which the antlers are simpler, and\r\nrecall those of the East Siberian race. The palmation appears to be more\r\nmarked in the North American race (_A. m. americanus_) than in the\r\ntypical Scandinavian elk. The largest of all is the Alaskan race (_A. m.\r\ngigas_), which is said to stand 8 ft. in height, with a span of 6 ft.\r\nacross the antlers. The great length of the legs gives a decidedly\r\nungainly appearance to the elk. The muzzle is long and fleshy, with only\r\na very small triangular naked patch below the nostrils; and the males\r\nhave a peculiar sac, known as the bell, hanging from the neck. From the\r\nshortness of their necks, elks are unable to graze, and their chief food\r\nconsists of young shoots and leaves of willow and birch. In North\r\nAmerica during the winter one male and several females form a\r\n\"moose-yard\" in the forest, which they keep open by trampling the snow.\r\nAlthough generally timid, the males become very bold during the breeding\r\nseason, when the females utter a loud call; and at such times they fight\r\nboth with their antlers and their hoofs. The usual pace is a shambling\r\ntrot, but when pressed elks break into a gallop. The female gives birth\r\nto one or two young at a time, which are not spotted. In America the elk\r\nis known as the moose, and the former name is transferred to the wapiti\r\ndeer.     (R.

Pop.\r\n(1890) 11,360; (1900) 15,184, of whom 1353 were foreign-born; (1910\r\ncensus) 19,282. Elkhart is at the junction of the western division with\r\nthe main line of the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern railway, and is\r\nserved by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St Louis, and the\r\nNorthern Indiana railways (the latter electric). It is attractively\r\nsituated and has fine business and public buildings, including a\r\nCarnegie library and the Clark hospital, with which a nurses' training\r\nschool is connected. It has also several parks, including the beautiful\r\nIsland Park and McNaughton Park, the latter the annual meeting-place of\r\nthe St Joseph Valley Chautauqua. A valuable water-power is utilized for\r\nmanufacturing purposes. There are extensive railway-car shops and iron\r\nand brass foundries, and the manufactures include band instruments,\r\nfurniture, telephone supplies, electric transformers, bridges, paper,\r\nflour, starch, rubber goods, acetylene gas machines, printing presses,\r\ndrugs and carriages. The total value of the factory product was\r\n$4,345,466 in 1905, an increase of 10.5% since 1900. At Elkhart is the\r\nmain publishing house of the Mennonite Church in America, two weekly\r\nperiodicals being issued, one in English, _The Herald of Truth_, and one\r\nin German, the _Mennonitische Rundschau_. The first settlement was made\r\nhere about 1834; and Elkhart was chartered as a city in 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELKINGTON, GEORGE RICHARDS (1801-1865), founder of the electroplating\r\nindustry in England, was born in Birmingham on the 17th of October 1801,\r\nthe son of a spectacle manufacturer. Apprenticed to his uncles, silver\r\nplaters in Birmingham, he became, on their death, sole proprietor of the\r\nbusiness, but subsequently took his cousin, Henry Elkington, into\r\npartnership. The science of electrometallurgy was then in its infancy,\r\nbut the Elkingtons were quick to recognize its possibilities. They had\r\nalready taken out certain patents for the application of electricity to\r\nmetals when, in 1840, John Wright, a Birmingham surgeon, discovered the\r\nvaluable properties of a solution of cyanide of silver in cyanide of\r\npotassium for electroplating purposes. The Elkingtons purchased and\r\npatented Wright's process, subsequently acquiring the rights of other\r\nprocesses and improvements. Large new works for electroplating and\r\nelectrogilding were opened in Birmingham in 1841, and in the following\r\nyear Josiah Mason became a partner in the firm. George Richards\r\nElkington died on the 22nd of September 1865, and Henry Elkington on the\r\n26th of October 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLA, or AELLA, the name of three Anglo-Saxon kings.\r\n\r\nELLA (d. c. 514), king of the South Saxons and founder of the kingdom\r\nof Sussex, was a Saxon ealdorman, who landed near Arundel in Sussex with\r\nhis three sons in 477. Defeating the Britons, who were driven into the\r\nforest of Andredsweald, Ella and his followers established themselves\r\nalong the south coast, although their progress was slow and difficult.\r\nHowever, in 491, strengthened by the arrival of fresh bands of\r\nimmigrants, they captured the Roman city of Anderida and \"slew all that\r\nwere therein.\" Ella, who is reckoned as the first Bretwalda, then became\r\nking of the South Saxons, and, when he died about 514, he was succeeded\r\nby his son Cissa.\r\n\r\nELLA (d. 588), king of the Deirans, was the son of an ealdorman named\r\nIffa, and became the first king of Deira when, in 559, the Deirans\r\nseparated themselves from the neighbouring kingdom of Bernicia. The\r\nEnglish slaves, who aroused the interest of Pope Gregory I. at Rome,\r\nwere subjects of Ella, and on this occasion the pope, punning the name\r\nof their king, suggested that \"Alleluia\" should be sung in his land.\r\nWhen Ella died in 588 Deira was conquered by Bernicia. One of his sons\r\nwas Edwin, afterwards king of the Northumbrians.\r\n\r\nELLA (d. 867), king of the Northumbrians, became king about 862 on the\r\ndeposition of Osbert, although he was not of royal birth. Afterwards he\r\nbecame reconciled with Osbert, and together they attacked the Danes, who\r\nhad invaded Northumbria, and drove them into York. Rallying, however,\r\nthe Danes defeated the Northumbrians, and in the encounter both Ella and\r\nOsbert were slain. In certain legends Ella is represented as having\r\nbrought about the Danish invasion of Northumbria by cruel and unjust\r\nactions.\r\n\r\n  See _The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, edited by C.

S. of Halifax by the\r\nLancashire & Yorkshire railway. Pop. (1901) 10,412. The church of St\r\nMary is Decorated and Perpendicular. Cotton-mills, woollen-factories,\r\nironworks, flagstone quarries at Elland Edge, and fire-clay works employ\r\nthe industrial population. Elland Hall, though almost rebuilt, retains\r\nthe recollection of a remarkable family feud between the Ellands and the\r\nBeaumonts of Crosland Hall, the site of which may be traced in the\r\nvicinity. A nephew of Sir John Elland, in 1342, met death at the hands\r\nof a relative of the Beaumonts upon whom Sir John took vengeance, as\r\nalso upon the heads of the allied houses of Lockwood and Quarmby. The\r\nchildren of these families were educated in the hope of avenging their\r\nparents, and after many years succeeded in doing so, cutting off Sir\r\nJohn Elland and his heir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLENBOROUGH, EDWARD LAW, 1ST BARON (1750-1818), English judge, was born\r\non the 16th of November 1750, at Great Salkeld, in Cumberland, of which\r\nplace his father, Edmund Law (1703-1787), afterwards bishop of Carlisle,\r\nwas at the time rector. Educated at the Charterhouse and at Peterhouse,\r\nCambridge, he passed as third wrangler, and was soon afterwards elected\r\nto a fellowship at Trinity. In spite of his father's strong wish that he\r\nshould take orders, he chose the legal profession, and on quitting the\r\nuniversity was entered at Lincoln's Inn. After spending five years as a\r\nspecial pleader under the bar, he was called to the bar in 1780. He\r\nchose the northern circuit, and in a very short time obtained a\r\nlucrative practice and a high reputation. In 1787 he was appointed\r\nprincipal counsel for Warren Hastings in the celebrated impeachment\r\ntrial before the House of Lords, and the ability with which he conducted\r\nthe defence was universally recognized. He had begun his political\r\ncareer as a Whig, but, like many others, he saw in the French Revolution\r\na reason for changing sides, and became a supporter of Pitt. On the\r\nformation of the Addington ministry in 1801, he was appointed\r\nattorney-general and shortly afterwards was returned to the House of\r\nCommons as member for Newtown in the Isle of Wight. In 1802 he succeeded\r\nLord Kenyon as chief justice of the king's bench. On being raised to the\r\nbench he was created a peer, taking his title from the village of\r\nEllenborough in Cumberland, where his maternal ancestors had long held a\r\nsmall patrimony. In 1806, on the formation of Lord Grenville's ministry\r\n\"of all the talents,\" Lord Ellenborough declined the offer of the great\r\nseal, but accepted a seat in the cabinet. His doing so while he retained\r\nthe chief justiceship was much criticized at the time, and, though not\r\nwithout precedent, was open to such obvious objections on constitutional\r\ngrounds that the experiment has not since been repeated. As a judge he\r\nhad grave faults, though his decisions displayed profound legal\r\nknowledge, and in mercantile law especially were reckoned of high\r\nauthority. He was harsh and overbearing to counsel, and in the political\r\ntrials which were so frequent in his time showed an unmistakable bias\r\nagainst the accused. In the trial of William Hone (q.v.) for blasphemy\r\nin 1817, Ellenborough directed the jury to find a verdict of guilty, and\r\ntheir acquittal of the prisoner is generally said to have hastened his\r\ndeath. He resigned his judicial office in November 1818, and died on the\r\n13th of December following.\r\n\r\nEllenborough was succeeded as 2nd baron by his eldest son, Edward,\r\nafterwards earl of Ellenborough; another son was Charles Ewan Law\r\n(1792-1850), recorder of London and member of parliament for Cambridge\r\nUniversity from 1835 until his death in August 1850.\r\n\r\nThree of Ellenborough's brothers attained some degree of fame. These\r\nwere John Law (1745-1810), bishop of Elphin; Thomas Law (1759-1834), who\r\nsettled in the United States in 1793, and married, as his second wife,\r\nAnne, a granddaughter of Martha Washington; and George Henry Law\r\n(1761-1845), bishop of Chester and of Bath and Wells. The connexion of\r\nthe Law family with the English Church was kept up by George Henry's\r\nsons, three of whom took orders. Two of these were Henry Law\r\n(1797-1884), dean of Gloucester, and James Thomas Law (1790-1876),\r\nchancellor of the diocese of Lichfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLENBOROUGH, EDWARD LAW, _Earl of_ (1790-1871), the eldest son of the\r\n1st Lord Ellenborough, was born on the 8th of September 1790. He was\r\neducated at Eton and St John's College, Cambridge. He represented the\r\nsubsequently disfranchised borough of St Michael's, Cornwall, in the\r\nHouse of Commons, until the death of his father in 1818 gave him a seat\r\nin the House of Lords. He was twice married; his only child died young;\r\nhis second wife was divorced by act of parliament in 1830.\r\n\r\nIn the Wellington administration of 1828 Ellenborough was made lord\r\nprivy seal; he took a considerable share in the business of the foreign\r\noffice, as an unofficial assistant to Wellington, who was a great\r\nadmirer of his talents. He aimed at succeeding Lord Dudley at the\r\nforeign office, but was forced to content himself with the presidency of\r\nthe board of control, which he retained until the fall of the ministry\r\nin 1830. Ellenborough was an active administrator, and took a lively\r\ninterest in questions of Indian policy. The revision of the company's\r\ncharter was approaching, and he held that the government of India should\r\nbe transferred directly to the crown. He was impressed with the growing\r\nimportance of a knowledge of central Asia, in the event of a Russian\r\nadvance towards the Indian frontier, and despatched Burnes on an\r\nexploring mission to that district. Ellenborough subsequently returned\r\nto the board of control in Peel's first and second administrations. He\r\nhad only held office for a month on the third occasion when he was\r\nappointed by the court of directors to succeed Lord Auckland as\r\ngovernor-general of India. His Indian administration of two and a half\r\nyears, or half the usual term of service, was from first to last a\r\nsubject of hostile criticism. His own letters sent monthly to the queen,\r\nand his correspondence with the duke of Wellington, published in 1874,\r\nafford material for an intelligent and impartial judgment of his\r\nmeteoric career. The events chiefly in dispute are his policy towards\r\nAfghanistan and the army and captives there, his conquest of Sind, and\r\nhis campaign in Gwalior.\r\n\r\nEllenborough went to India in order \"to restore peace to Asia,\" but the\r\nwhole term of his office was occupied in war. On his arrival there the\r\nnews that greeted him was that of the massacre of Kabul, and the sieges\r\nof Ghazni and Jalalabad, while the sepoys of Madras were on the verge of\r\nopen mutiny. In his proclamation of the 15th of March 1842, as in his\r\nmemorandum for the queen dated the 18th, he stated with characteristic\r\nclearness and eloquence the duty of first inflicting some signal and\r\ndecisive blow on the Afghans, and then leaving them to govern themselves\r\nunder the sovereign of their own choice. Unhappily, when he left his\r\ncouncil for upper India, and learned the trifling failure of General\r\nEngland, he instructed Pollock and Nott, who were advancing triumphantly\r\nwith their avenging columns to rescue the British captives, to fall\r\nback. The army proved true to the governor-general's earlier\r\nproclamation rather than to his later fears; the hostages were rescued,\r\nthe scene of Sir Alexander Burnes's murder in the heart of Kabul was\r\nburned down. Dost Mahommed was quietly dismissed from a prison in\r\nCalcutta to the throne in the Bala Hissar, and Ellenborough presided\r\nover the painting of the elephants for an unprecedented military\r\nspectacle at Ferozepur, on the south bank of the Sutlej. But this was\r\nnot the only piece of theatrical display which capped with ridicule the\r\nhorrors and the follies of these four years in Afghanistan. When Sultan\r\nMahmud, in 1024, sacked the Hindu temple of Somnath on the north-west\r\ncoast of India, he carried off, with the treasures, the richly studded\r\nsandal-wood gates of the fane, and set them up in his capital of\r\nGhazni. The Mahommedan puppet of the English, Shah Shuja, had been\r\nasked, when ruler of Afghanistan, to restore them to India; and what he\r\nhad failed to do the Christian ruler of opposing Mahommedans and Hindus\r\nresolved to effect in the most solemn and public manner. In vain had\r\nMajor (afterwards Sir Henry) Rawlinson proved that they were only\r\nreproductions of the original gates, to which the Ghazni moulvies clung\r\nmerely as a source of offerings from the faithful who visited the old\r\nconqueror's tomb. In vain did the Hindu sepoys show the most chilling\r\nindifference to the belauded restoration. Ellenborough could not resist\r\nthe temptation to copy Napoleon's magniloquent proclamation under the\r\npyramids. The fraudulent folding doors were conveyed on a triumphal car\r\nto the fort of Agra, where they were found to be made not of sandalwood\r\nbut of deal. That Somnath proclamation (immortalized in a speech by\r\nMacaulay) was the first step towards its author's recall.\r\n\r\nHardly had Ellenborough issued his medal with the legend \"Pax Asiae\r\nRestituta\" when he was at war with the amirs of Sind. The tributary\r\namirs had on the whole been faithful, for Major (afterwards Sir James)\r\nOutram controlled them. But he had reported the opposition of a few, and\r\nEllenborough ordered an inquiry. His instructions were admirable, in\r\nequity as well as energy, and if Outram had been left to carry them out\r\nall would have been well. But the duty was entrusted to Sir Charles\r\nNapier, with full political as well as military powers. And to add to\r\nthe evil, Mir Ali Morad intrigued with both sides so effectually that he\r\nbetrayed the amirs on the one hand, while he deluded Sir Charles Napier\r\nto their destruction on the other. Ellenborough was led on till events\r\nwere beyond his control, and his own just and merciful instructions were\r\nforgotten. Sir Charles Napier made more than one confession like this:\r\n\"We have no right to seize Sind, yet we shall do so, and a very\r\nadvantageous, useful and humane piece of rascality it will be.\" The\r\nbattles of Meeanee and Hyderabad followed; and the Indus became a\r\nBritish river from Karachi to Multan.\r\n\r\nSind had hardly been disposed of when troubles arose on both sides of\r\nthe governor-general, who was then at Agra. On the north the disordered\r\nkingdom of the Sikhs was threatening the frontier. In Gwalior to the\r\nsouth, the feudatory Mahratta state, there were a large mutinous army, a\r\nRanee only twelve years of age, an adopted chief of eight, and factions\r\nin the council of ministers. These conditions brought Gwalior to the\r\nverge of civil war. Ellenborough reviewed the danger in the minute of\r\nthe 1st of November 1845, and told Sir Hugh Gough to advance. Further\r\ntreachery and military licence rendered the battles of Maharajpur and\r\nPunniar, fought on the same day, inevitable though they were, a surprise\r\nto the combatants. The treaty that followed was as merciful as it was\r\nwise. The pacification of Gwalior also had its effect beyond the Sutlej,\r\nwhere anarchy was restrained for yet another year, and the work of\r\ncivilization was left to Ellenborough's two successors. But by this time\r\nthe patience of the directors was exhausted. They had no control over\r\nEllenborough's policy; his despatches to them were haughty and\r\ndisrespectful; and in June 1844 they exercised their power of recalling\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOn his return to England Ellenborough was created an earl and received\r\nthe thanks of parliament; but his administration speedily became the\r\ntheme of hostile debates, though it was successfully vindicated by Peel\r\nand Wellington. When Peel's cabinet was reconstituted in 1846\r\nEllenborough became first lord of the admiralty. In 1858 he took office\r\nunder Lord Derby as president of the board of control, for the fourth\r\ntime. It was then his congenial task to draft the new scheme for the\r\ngovernment of India which the mutiny had rendered necessary. But his old\r\nfault of impetuosity again proved his stumbling-block. He wrote a\r\ncaustic despatch censuring Lord Canning for the Oudh proclamation, and\r\nallowed it to be published in _The Times_ without consulting his\r\ncolleagues, who disavowed his action in this respect. General\r\ndisapprobation was excited; votes of censure were announced in both\r\nHouses; and, to save the cabinet, Ellenborough resigned.\r\n\r\nBut for this act of rashness he might have enjoyed the task of carrying\r\ninto effect the home constitution for the government of India which he\r\nsketched in his evidence before the select committee of the House of\r\nCommons on Indian territories on the 8th of June 1852. Paying off his\r\nold score against the East India Company, he then advocated the\r\nabolition of the court of directors as a governing body, the opening of\r\nthe civil service to the army, the transference of the government to the\r\ncrown, and the appointment of a council to advise the minister who\r\nshould take the place of the president of the board of control. These\r\nsuggestions of 1852 were carried out by his successor Lord Stanley,\r\nafterwards earl of Derby, in 1858, so closely even in details, that Lord\r\nEllenborough must be pronounced the author, for good or evil, of the\r\npresent home constitution of the government of India. Though\r\nacknowledged to be one of the foremost orators in the House of Lords,\r\nand taking a frequent part in debate, Ellenborough never held office\r\nagain. He died at his seat, Southam House, near Cheltenham, on the 22nd\r\nof December 1871, when the barony reverted to his nephew Charles Edmund\r\nLaw (1820-1890), the earldom becoming extinct.\r\n\r\n  See _History of the Indian Administration_ (Bentley, 1874), edited by\r\n  Lord Colchester; _Minutes of Evidence taken before the Select\r\n  Committee on Indian Territories_ (June 1852); volume i. of the\r\n  _Calcutta Review_; the _Friend of India_, during the years 1842-1845;\r\n  and John Hope, _The House of Scindea: A Sketch_ (Longmans, 1863).

He graduated from Harvard in 1747, engaged in\r\ntrade, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1770. He was a member\r\nof the Rhode Island committee of safety in 1775-1776, and was a delegate\r\nin Congress in 1776-1781 and again in 1783-1785. Just after his first\r\nelection to Congress, he was placed on the important marine committee,\r\nand he was made a member of the board of admiralty when it was\r\nestablished in 1779. In April 1786 he was elected commissioner of the\r\ncontinental loan office for the state of Rhode Island and from 1790\r\nuntil his death at Newport, on the 15th of February 1820, he was\r\ncollector of the customs for the district of Newport.\r\n\r\n  See Edward T. Channing, \"Life of William Ellery,\" in vol. 6 of Jared\r\n  Sparks's _American Biography_ (Boston and London, 1836).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLESMERE, FRANCIS EGERTON, 1ST EARL OF (1800-1857), born in London on\r\nthe 1st of January 1800, was the second son of the 1st duke of\r\nSutherland. He was known by his patronymic as Lord Francis Leveson Gower\r\nuntil 1833, when he assumed the surname of Egerton alone, having\r\nsucceeded on the death of his father to the estates which the latter\r\ninherited from the duke of Bridgewater. Educated at Eton and at Christ\r\nChurch, Oxford, he entered parliament soon after attaining his majority\r\nas member for the pocket borough of Bletchingly in Surrey. He afterwards\r\nsat for Sutherlandshire and for South Lancashire, which he represented\r\nwhen he was elevated to the peerage as earl of Ellesmere and Viscount\r\nBrackley in 1846. In politics he was a moderate Conservative of\r\nindependent views, as was shown by his supporting the proposal for\r\nestablishing the university of London, by his making and carrying a\r\nmotion for the endowment of the Roman Catholic clergy in Ireland, and by\r\nhis advocating free trade long before Sir Robert Peel yielded on the\r\nquestion. Appointed a lord of the treasury in 1827, he held the post of\r\nchief secretary for Ireland from 1828 till July 1830, when he became\r\nsecretary-at-war for a short time. His claims to remembrance are founded\r\nchiefly on his services to literature and the fine arts. Before he was\r\ntwenty he printed for private circulation a volume of poems, which he\r\nfollowed up after a short interval by the publication of a translation\r\nof Goethe's Faust, one of the earliest that appeared in England, with\r\nsome translations of German lyrics and a few original poems. In 1839 he\r\nvisited the Mediterranean and the Holy Land. His impressions of travel\r\nwere recorded in his very agreeably written _Mediterranean Sketches_\r\n(1843), and in the notes to a poem entitled _The Pilgrimage_. He\r\npublished several other works in prose and verse, all displaying a fine\r\nliterary taste. His literary reputation secured for him the position of\r\nrector of Aberdeen University in 1841. Lord Ellesmere was a munificent\r\nand yet discriminating patron of artists. To the splendid collection of\r\npictures which he inherited from his great-uncle, the 3rd duke of\r\nBridgewater, he made numerous additions, and he built a noble gallery to\r\nwhich the public were allowed free access. Lord Ellesmere served as\r\npresident of the Royal Geographical Society and as president of the\r\nRoyal Asiatic Society, and he was a trustee of the National Gallery. He\r\ndied on the 18th of February 1857. He was succeeded by his son\r\n(1823-1862) as 2nd earl, and his grandson (b. 1847) as 3rd earl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLESMERE, a market town in the Oswestry parliamentary division of\r\nShropshire, England, on the main line of the Cambrian railway, 182 m.\r\nN.W. from London. Pop. of urban district (1901) 1945. It is prettily\r\nsituated on the west shore of the mere or small lake from which it takes\r\nits name, while in the neighbourhood are other sheets of water, as Blake\r\nMere, Cole Mere, White Mere, Newton Mere and Crose Mere. The church of\r\nSt Mary is of various styles from Norman onward, but was partly rebuilt\r\nin 1848. The site of the castle is occupied by pleasure gardens,\r\ncommanding an extensive view from high ground. The town hall contains a\r\nlibrary and a natural history collection. The college is a large boys'\r\nschool. The town is an important agricultural centre. Ellesmere canal, a\r\nfamous work of Thomas Telford, connects the Severn with the Mersey,\r\ncrossing the Vale of Llangollen by an immense aqueduct, 336 yds. long\r\nand 127 ft. high.\r\n\r\nThe manor of Ellesmere (_Ellesmeles_) belonged before the Conquest to\r\nEarl Edwin of Mercia, and was granted by William the Conqueror to Roger,\r\nearl of Shrewsbury, whose son, Robert de Belesme, forfeited it in 1112\r\nfor treason against Henry I. In 1177 Henry II. gave it with his sister\r\nin marriage to David, son of Owen, prince of North Wales, after whose\r\ndeath it was retained by King John, who in 1206 granted it to his\r\ndaughter Joan on her marriage with Llewellyn, prince of North Wales; it\r\nwas finally surrendered to Henry III. by David, son of Llewellyn, about\r\n1240. Ellesmere owed its early importance to its position on the Welsh\r\nborders and to its castle, which was in ruins, however, in 1349. While\r\nEllesmere was in the hands of Joan, lady of Wales, she granted to the\r\nborough all the free customs of Breteuil. The town was governed by a\r\nbailiff appointed by a jury at one of the court leets of the lord of the\r\nmanor, until a local board was formed in 1859. In 1221 Henry III.\r\ngranted Llewellyn, prince of Wales, a market on Thursdays in Ellesmere.\r\nThe inquisition taken in 1383 after the death of Roger le Straunge (Lord\r\nStrange), lord of Ellesmere, shows that he also held two fairs there on\r\nthe feasts of St Martin and the Nativity of the Virgin Mary. By 1597 the\r\nmarket had been discontinued on account of the plague by which many of\r\nthe inhabitants had died, and the queen granted that Sir Edward\r\nKynaston, Kt., and thirteen others might hold a market every Thursday\r\nand a fair on the 3rd of November. Since 1792 both have been\r\ndiscontinued. The commerce of Ellesmere has always been chiefly\r\nagricultural.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLICE (LAGOON) ISLANDS, an archipelago of the Pacific Ocean, lying\r\nbetween 5 deg. and 11 deg. S. and about 178 deg. E., nearly midway\r\nbetween Fiji and Gilbert. It is under British protection, being annexed\r\nin 1892. It comprises a large number of low coralline islands and\r\natolls, which are disposed in nine clusters extending over a distance of\r\nabout 400 m. in the direction from N.W. to S.E. Their total area is 14\r\nsq. m. and the population is about 2400. The chief groups, all yielding\r\ncoco-nuts, pandanus fruit and yams, are Funafuti or Ellice, Nukulailai\r\nor Mitchell, Nurakita or Sophia, Nukufetau or De Peyster, Nui or Egg,\r\nNanomana or Hudson, and Niutao or Lynx. Nearly all the natives are\r\nChristians, Protestant missions having been long established in several\r\nof the islands. Those of Nui speak the language of the Gilbert\r\nislanders, and have a tradition that they came some generations ago from\r\nthat group. All the others are of Samoan speech, and their tradition\r\nthat they came thirty generations back from Samoa is supported by recent\r\nresearch. They have an ancient spear which they believe was brought from\r\nSamoa, and they actually name the valley from which their ancestors\r\nstarted. A missionary visiting the Samoan valley found there a\r\ntradition of a party who put to sea never to return, and he also found\r\nthe wood of which the staff was made growing plentifully in the\r\ndistrict. Borings and soundings taken at Funafuti in 1897 indicate\r\nalmost beyond doubt that the whole of this Polynesian region is an area\r\nof comparatively recent subsidence.\r\n\r\n  See _Geographical Journal_, passim; and _Atoll of Funafuti: Borings\r\n  into a Coral Reef_ (Report of Coral Reef Committee of Royal Society,\r\n  London, 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLICHPUR, or ILLICHPUR, a town of India in the Amraoti district of\r\nBerar. Pop. (1901) 26,082. It is first mentioned authentically in the\r\n13th century as \"one of the famous cities of the Deccan.\" Though\r\ntributary to the Mahommedans after 1294, it remained under Hindu\r\nadministration till 1318, when it came directly under the Mahommedans.\r\nIt was afterwards capital of the province of Berar at intervals until\r\nthe Mogul occupation, when the seat of the provincial governor was moved\r\nto Balapur. The town retains many relics of the nawabs of Berar. It has\r\nginning factories and a considerable trade in cotton and forest produce.\r\nIt is connected by good roads with Amraoti and Chikalda. It was formerly\r\nthe headquarters of the district of Ellichpur, which had an area of 2605\r\nsq. m. and a population in 1901 of 297,403. This district, however, was\r\nmerged in that of Amraoti in 1905. The civil station of Paratwada, 2 m.\r\nfrom the town of Ellichpur, contains the principal public buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLIOTSON, JOHN (1791-1868), English physician, was born at Southwark,\r\nLondon, on the 29th of October 1791. He studied medicine first at\r\nEdinburgh and then at Cambridge, in both which places he took the degree\r\nof M.D., and subsequently in London at St Thomas's and Guy's hospitals.\r\nIn 1831 he was elected professor of the principles and practice of\r\nphysic in London University, and in 1834 he became physician to\r\nUniversity College hospital. He was a student of phrenology and\r\nmesmerism, and his interest in the latter eventually brought him into\r\ncollision with the medical committee of the hospital, a circumstance\r\nwhich led him, in December 1838, to resign the offices held by him there\r\nand at the university. But he continued the practice of mesmerism,\r\nholding seances in his home and editing a magazine, _The Zoist_, devoted\r\nto the subject, and in 1849 he founded a mesmeric hospital. He died in\r\nLondon on the 29th of July 1868. Elliotson was one of the first teachers\r\nin London to appreciate the value of clinical lecturing, and one of the\r\nearliest among British physicians to advocate the employment of the\r\nstethoscope. He wrote a translation of Blumenbach's _Institutiones\r\nPhysiologicae_ (1817); _Cases of the Hydrocyanic or Prussic Acid_\r\n(1820); _Lectures on Diseases of the Heart_ (1830); _Principles and\r\nPractice of Medicine_ (1839); _Human Physiology_ (1840); and _Surgical\r\nOperations in the Mesmeric State without Pain_ (1843). He was the author\r\nof numerous papers in the _Transactions_ of the Medico-Chirurgical\r\nSociety, of which he was at one time president; and he was also a fellow\r\nboth of the Royal College of Physicians and Royal Society, and founder\r\nand president of the Phrenological Society. W.M. Thackeray's _Pendennis_\r\nwas dedicated to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLIOTT, EBENEZER (1781-1849), English poet, the \"corn-law rhymer,\" was\r\nborn at Masborough, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, on the 17th of March\r\n1781. His father, who was an extreme Calvinist and a strong radical, was\r\nengaged in the iron trade. Young Ebenezer, although one of a large\r\nfamily, had a solitary and rather morbid childhood. He was sent to\r\nvarious schools, but was generally regarded as a dunce, and when he was\r\nsixteen years of age he entered his father's foundry, working for seven\r\nyears with no wages beyond a little pocket money. In a fragment of\r\nautobiography printed in the _Athenaeum_ (12th of January 1850) he says\r\nthat he was entirely self-taught, and attributes his poetic development\r\nto long country walks undertaken in search of wild flowers, and to a\r\ncollection of books, including the works of Young, Barrow, Shenstone and\r\nMilton, bequeathed to his father by a poor clergyman. At seventeen he\r\nwrote his _Vernal Walk_ in imitation of Thomson. His earlier volumes of\r\npoems, dealing with romantic themes, received little but unfriendly\r\ncomment. The faults of _Night_, the earliest of these, are pointed out\r\nin a long and friendly letter (30th of January 1819) from Robert Southey\r\nto the author.\r\n\r\nElliott's wife brought him some money, which was invested in his\r\nfather's share of the iron foundry. But the affairs of the firm were\r\nthen in a desperate condition, and money difficulties hastened his\r\nfather's death. Elliott lost all his money, and when he was forty years\r\nold began business again in Sheffield on a small borrowed capital. He\r\nattributed his father's pecuniary losses and his own to the operation of\r\nthe corn laws. He took an active part in the Chartist agitation, but\r\nwithdrew his support when the agitation for the repeal of the corn laws\r\nwas removed from the Chartist programme. The fervour of his political\r\nconvictions effected a change in the style and tenor of his verse. The\r\n_Corn-Law Rhymes_ (3rd ed., 1831), inspired by a fierce hatred of\r\ninjustice, are vigorous, simple and full of vivid description. In\r\n1833-1835 he published _The Splendid Village_; _Corn-Law Rhymes, and\r\nother Poems_ (3 vols.), which included \"The Village Patriarch\" (1829),\r\n\"The Ranter,\" an unsuccessful drama, \"Keronah,\" and other pieces. He\r\ncontributed verses from time to time to _Tait's Magazine_ and to the\r\n_Sheffield and Rotherham Independent_. In the meantime he had been\r\nsuccessful in business, but he remained the sturdy champion of the poor.\r\nIn 1837 he again lost a great deal of money. This misfortune was also\r\nascribed to the corn laws. He retired in 1841 with a small fortune and\r\nsettled at Great Houghton, near Barnsley, where he died on the 1st of\r\nDecember 1849. In 1850 appeared two volumes of _More Prose and Verse by\r\nthe Corn-Law Rhymer_. Elliott lives by his determined opposition to the\r\n\"bread-tax,\" as he called it, and his poems on the subject are saved\r\nfrom the common fate of political poetry by their transparent sincerity\r\nand passionate earnestness.\r\n\r\n  An article by Thomas Carlyle in the _Edinburgh Review_ (July 1832) is\r\n  the best criticism on Elliott. Carlyle was attracted by Elliott's\r\n  homely sincerity and genuine power, though he had small opinion of his\r\n  political philosophy, and lamented his lack of humour and of the sense\r\n  of proportion. He thought his poetry too imitative, detecting not only\r\n  the truthful severity of Crabbe, but a \"slight bravura dash of the\r\n  fair tuneful Hemans.\" His descriptions of his native county reveal\r\n  close observation and a vivid perception of natural beauty.\r\n\r\n  See an obituary notice in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ (Feb. 1850). Two\r\n  biographies were published in 1850, one by his son-in-law, John\r\n  Watkins, and another by \"January Searle\" (G.S. Phillips). A new\r\n  edition of his works by his son, Edwin Elliott, appeared in 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLIPSE (adapted from Gr. [Greek: elleipsis], a deficiency, [Greek:\r\nelleipein], to fall behind), in mathematics, a conic section, having the\r\nform of a closed oval. It admits of several definitions framed according\r\nto the aspect from which the curve is considered. _In solido_, i.e. as a\r\nsection of a cone or cylinder, it may be defined, after Menaechmus, as\r\nthe perpendicular section of an \"acute-angled\" cone; or, after\r\nApollonius of Perga, as the section of any cone by a plane at a less\r\ninclination to the base than a generator; or as an oblique section of a\r\nright cylinder. Definitions _in plano_ are generally more useful; of\r\nthese the most important are: (1) the ellipse is the conic section which\r\nhas its eccentricity less than unity: this involves the notion of one\r\ndirectrix and one focus; (2) the ellipse is the locus of a point the sum\r\nof whose distances from two fixed points is constant: this involves the\r\nnotion of two foci. Other geometrical definitions are: it is the oblique\r\nprojection of a circle; the polar reciprocal of a circle for a point\r\nwithin it; and the conic which intersects the line at infinity in two\r\nimaginary points. Analytically it is defined by an equation of the\r\nsecond degree of which the highest terms represent two imaginary lines.\r\nThe curve has important mechanical relations, in particular it is the\r\norbit of a particle moving under the influence of a central force which\r\nvaries inversely as the square of the distance of the particle; this is\r\nthe gravitational law of force, and the curve consequently represents\r\nthe orbits of the planets if only an individual planet and the sun be\r\nconsidered; the other planets, however, disturb this orbit (see\r\nMECHANICS).\r\n\r\nThe relation of the ellipse to the other conic sections is treated in\r\nthe articles CONIC SECTION and GEOMETRY; in this article a summary of\r\nthe properties of the curve will be given.\r\n\r\n  To investigate the form of the curve use may be made of the\r\n  definition: the ellipse is the locus of a point which moves so that\r\n  the ratio of its distance from a fixed point (the _focus_) to its\r\n  distance from a straight line (the _directrix_) is constant and is\r\n  less than unity. This ratio is termed the _eccentricity_, and will be\r\n  denoted by e. Let KX (fig. 1) be the directrix, S the focus, and X the\r\n  foot of the perpendicular from S to KX. If SX be divided at A so that\r\n  SA/AX = e, then A is a point on the curve. SX may be also divided\r\n  externally at A', so that SA'/A'X = e, since e is less than unity; the\r\n  points A and A' are the _vertices_, and the line AA' the _major axis_\r\n  of the curve. It is obvious that the curve is symmetrical about AA'.\r\n  If AA' be bisected at C, and the line BCB' be drawn perpendicular to\r\n  AA', then it is readily seen that the curve is symmetrical about this\r\n  line also; since if we take S' on AA' so that S'A' = SA, and a line\r\n  K'X' parallel to KX such that AX = A'X', then the same curve will be\r\n  described if we regard K'X' and S' as the given directrix and focus,\r\n  the eccentricity remaining the same. If B and B' be points on the\r\n  curve, BB' is the _minor axis_ and C the _centre_ of the curve.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n  Metrical relations between the axes, eccentricity, distance between\r\n  the foci, and between these quantities and the co-ordinates of points\r\n  on the curve (referred to the axes and the centre), and focal\r\n  distances are readily obtained by the methods of geometrical conics or\r\n  analytically. The semi-major axis is generally denoted by a, and the\r\n  semi-minor axis by b, and we have the relation b^2 = a^2(1 - e^2). Also\r\n  a^2 = CS.CX, i.e. the square on the semi-major axis equals the\r\n  rectangle contained by the distances of the focus and directrix from\r\n  the centre; and 2a = SP + S'P, where P is any point on the curve, i.e.\r\n  the sum of the focal distances of any point on the curve equals the\r\n  major axis. The most important relation between the co-ordinates of a\r\n  point on an ellipse is: if N be the foot of the perpendicular from a\r\n  point P, then the square on PN bears a constant ratio to the product\r\n  of the segments AN, NA' of the major axis, this ratio being the square\r\n  of the ratio of the minor to the major axis; symbolically PN^2 =\r\n  AN.NA'(CB/CA)^2. From this or otherwise it is readily deduced that the\r\n  ordinates of an ellipse and of the circle described on the major axis\r\n  are in the ratio of the minor to the major axis. This circle is termed\r\n  the _auxiliary circle_.\r\n\r\n  Of the properties of a tangent it may be noticed that the tangent at\r\n  any point is equally inclined to the focal distances of that point;\r\n  that the feet of the perpendiculars from the foci on any tangent\r\n  always lie on the auxiliary circle, and the product of these\r\n  perpendiculars is constant, and equal to the product of the distances\r\n  of a focus from the two vertices. From any point without the curve\r\n  two, and only two, tangents can be drawn; if OP, OP' be two tangents\r\n  from O, and S, S' the foci, then the angles OSP, OSP' are equal and\r\n  also SOP, S'OP'. If the tangents be at right angles, then the locus of\r\n  the point is a circle having the same centre as the ellipse; this is\r\n  named the _director circle_.\r\n\r\n  The middle points of a system of parallel chords is a straight line,\r\n  and the tangent at the point where this line meets the curve is\r\n  parallel to the chords. The straight line and the line through the\r\n  centre parallel to the chords are named _conjugate diameters_; each\r\n  bisects the chords parallel to the other. An important metrical\r\n  property of conjugate diameters is the sum of their squares equals the\r\n  sum of the squares of the major and minor axis.\r\n\r\n  In analytical geometry, the equation ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 + 2gx + 2fy +\r\n  c = 0 represents an ellipse when ab > h^2; if the centre of the curve\r\n  be the origin, the equation is a^1x^2 + 2h^1xy + b^1y^2 = C^1, and if\r\n  in addition a pair of conjugate diameters are the axes, the equation\r\n  is further simplified to Ax^2 + By^2 = C. The simplest form is x^2/a^2\r\n  + y^2/b^2 = 1, in which the centre is the origin and the major and\r\n  minor axes the axes of co-ordinates. It is obvious that the\r\n  co-ordinates of any point on an ellipse may be expressed in terms of a\r\n  single parameter, the abscissa being a cos [phi], and the ordinate b\r\n  sin [phi], since on eliminating [phi] between x = a cos [phi] and y =\r\n  b sin [phi] we obtain the equation to the ellipse. The angle [phi] is\r\n  termed the _eccentric angle_, and is geometrically represented as the\r\n  angle between the axis of x (the major axis of the ellipse) and the\r\n  radius of a point on the auxiliary circle which has the same abscissa\r\n  as the point on the ellipse.\r\n\r\n  The equation to the tangent at [theta] is x cos [theta]/a + y sin\r\n  [theta]/b = 1, and to the normal ax/cos [theta] - by/sin [theta] =\r\n  a^2 - b^2.\r\n\r\n  The area of the ellipse is [pi]ab, where a, b are the semi-axes; this\r\n  result may be deduced by regarding the ellipse as the orthogonal\r\n  projection of a circle, or by means of the calculus. The perimeter can\r\n  only be expressed as a series, the analytical evaluation leading to an\r\n  integral termed _elliptic_ (see FUNCTION, ii. _Complex_). There are\r\n  several approximation formulae:--S = [pi](a + b) makes the perimeter\r\n  about 1/200th too small; s =[pi][root](a^2+b^2) about 1/200th too\r\n  great; 2s = [pi](a + b) + [pi][root](a^2 + b^2) is within 1/30,000 of\r\n  the truth.\r\n\r\n  An ellipse can generally be described to satisfy any five conditions.\r\n  If five points be given, Pascal's theorem affords a solution; if five\r\n  tangents, Brianchon's theorem is employed. The principle of\r\n  involution solves such constructions as: given four tangents and one\r\n  point, three tangents and two points, &c. If a tangent and its point\r\n  of contact be given, it is only necessary to remember that a double\r\n  point on the curve is given. A focus or directrix is equal to two\r\n  conditions; hence such problems as: given a focus and three points; a\r\n  focus, two points and one tangent; and a focus, one point and two\r\n  tangents are soluble (very conveniently by employing the principle of\r\n  reciprocation). Of practical importance are the following\r\n  constructions:--(1) Given the axes; (2) given the major axis and the\r\n  foci; (3) given the focus, eccentricity and directrix; (4) to\r\n  construct an ellipse (approximately) by means of circular arcs.\r\n\r\n  (1) If the axes be given, we may avail ourselves of several\r\n  constructions, (a) Let AA', BB' be the axes intersecting at right\r\n  angles in a point C. Take a strip of paper or rule and mark off from a\r\n  point P, distances Pa and Pb equal respectively to CA and CB. If now\r\n  the strip be moved so that the point a is always on the minor axis,\r\n  and the point b on the major axis, the point P describes the ellipse.\r\n  This is known as the _trammel_ construction.\r\n\r\n  (b) Let AA', BB' be the axes as before; describe on each as diameter a\r\n  circle. Draw any number of radii of the two circles, and from the\r\n  points of intersection with the major circle draw lines parallel to\r\n  the minor axis, and from the points of intersection with the minor\r\n  circle draw lines parallel to the major axis. The intersections of the\r\n  lines drawn from corresponding points are points on the ellipse.\r\n\r\n  (2) If the major axis and foci be given, there is a convenient\r\n  mechanical construction based on the property that the sum of the\r\n  focal distances of any point is constant and equal to the major axis.\r\n  Let AA' be the axis and S, S' the foci. Take a piece of thread of\r\n  length AA', and fix it at its extremities by means of pins at the\r\n  foci. The thread is now stretched taut by a pencil, and the pencil\r\n  moved; the curve traced out is the desired ellipse.\r\n\r\n  (3) If the directrix, focus and eccentricity be given, we may employ\r\n  the general method for constructing a conic. Let S (fig. 2) be the\r\n  focus, KX the directrix, X being the foot of the perpendicular from S\r\n  to the directrix. Divide SX internally at A and externally at A', so\r\n  that the ratios SA/AX and SA'/A'X are each equal to the eccentricity.\r\n  Then A, A' are the vertices of the curve. Take any point R on the\r\n  directrix, and draw the lines RAM, RSN; draw SL so that the angle LSN\r\n  = angle NSA'. Let P be the intersection of the line SL with the line\r\n  RAM, then it can be readily shown that P is a point on the ellipse.\r\n  For, draw through P a line parallel to AA', intersecting the directrix\r\n  in Q and the line RSN in T. Then since XS and QT are parallel and are\r\n  intersected by the lines RK, RM, RN, we have SA/AX = TP/PQ = SP/PQ,\r\n  since the angle PST = angle PTS. By varying the position of R other\r\n  points can be found, and, since the curve is symmetrical about both\r\n  the major and minor axes, it is obvious that any point may be\r\n  reflected in both the axes, thus giving 3 additional points.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n  (4) If the axes be given, the curve can be approximately constructed\r\n  by circular arcs in the following manner:--Let AA', BB' be the axes;\r\n  determine D the intersection of lines through B and A parallel to the\r\n  major and minor axes respectively. Bisect AD at E and join EB. Then\r\n  the intersection of EB and DB' determines a point P on the (true)\r\n  curve. Bisect the chord PB at G, and draw through G a line\r\n  perpendicular to PB, intersecting BB' in O. An arc with centre O and\r\n  radius OB forms part of a curve. Let this arc on the reverse side to P\r\n  intersect a line through O parallel to the major axis in a point H.\r\n  Then HA^1 will cut the circular arc in J. Let JO intersect the major\r\n  axis in O1. Then with centre O1 and radius OJ = OA^1, describe an arc.\r\n  By reflecting the two arcs thus described over the centre the ellipse\r\n  is approximately described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLIPSOID, a quadric surface whose sections are ellipses. Analytically,\r\nit has for its equation x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 + z^2/c^2 = 1, a, b, c being\r\nits axes; the name is also given to the solid contained by this surface\r\n(see GEOMETRY: _Analytical_). The solids and surfaces of revolution of\r\nthe ellipse are sometimes termed ellipsoids, but it is advisable to use\r\nthe name spheroid (q.v.).\r\n\r\nThe ellipsoid appears in the mathematical investigation of physical\r\nproperties of media in which the particular property varies in three\r\ndirections within the media; such properties are the elasticity, giving\r\nrise to the strain ellipsoid, thermal expansion, ellipsoid of expansion,\r\nthermal conduction, refractive index (see CRYSTALLOGRAPHY), &c. In\r\nmechanics, the ellipsoid of gyration or inertia is such that the\r\nperpendicular from the centre to a tangent plane is equal to the radius\r\nof gyration of the given body about the perpendicular as axis; the\r\n\"momental ellipsoid,\" also termed the \"inverse ellipsoid of inertia\" or\r\nPoinsot's ellipsoid, has the perpendicular inversely proportional to\r\nthe radius of gyration; the \"equimomental ellipsoid\" is such that its\r\nmoments of inertia about all axes are the same as those of a given body.\r\n(See MECHANICS.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLIPTICITY, in astronomy, deviation from a circular or spherical form;\r\napplied to the elliptic orbits of heavenly bodies, or the spheroidal\r\nform of such bodies. (See also COMPRESSION.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLIS (originally SHARPE), ALEXANDER JOHN (1814-1890), English\r\nphilologist, mathematician, musician and writer on phonetics, was born\r\nat Hoxton on the 14th of June 1814. He was educated at Shrewsbury, Eton,\r\nand Trinity College, Cambridge, and took his degree in high mathematical\r\nhonours. He was connected with many learned societies as member or\r\npresident, and was governor of University College, London. He was the\r\nfirst in England to reduce the study of phonetics to a science. His most\r\nimportant work, to which the greater part of his life was devoted, is\r\n_On Early English Pronunciation, with special reference to Shakespeare\r\nand Chaucer_ (1869-1889), in five parts, which he intended to supplement\r\nby a sixth, containing an abstract of the whole, an account of the views\r\nand criticisms of other inquirers in the same field, and a complete\r\nindex, but ill-health prevented him from carrying out his intention. He\r\nhad long been associated with Isaac Pitman in his attempts to reform\r\nEnglish spelling, and published _A Plea for Phonotypy and Phonography_\r\n(1845) and _A Plea for Phonetic Spelling_ (1848); and contributed the\r\narticles on \"Phonetics\" and \"Speech-sounds\" to the 9th edition of the\r\n_Ency. Brit._ He translated (with considerable additions) Helmholtz's\r\n_Sensations of Tone as a physiological Basis for the Theory of Music_\r\n(2nd ed., 1885); and was the author of several smaller works on music,\r\nchiefly in connexion with his favourite subject phonetics. He died in\r\nLondon on the 28th of October 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLIS, GEORGE (1753-1815), English author, was born in London in 1753.\r\nEducated at Westminster school and at Trinity College, Cambridge, he\r\nbegan his literary career by some satirical verses on Bath society\r\npublished in 1777, and _Poetical Tales_, by \"Sir Gregory Gander,\" in\r\n1778. He contributed to the _Rolliad_ and the _Probationary Odes_\r\npolitical satires directed against Pitt's administration. He was\r\nemployed in diplomatic business at the Hague in 1784; and in 1797 he\r\naccompanied Lord Malmesbury to Lille as secretary to the embassy. On his\r\nreturn he was introduced to Pitt, and the episode of the _Rolliad_,\r\nwhich had not been forgotten, was explained. He found continued scope\r\nfor his powers as a political caricaturist in the columns of the\r\n_Anti-Jacobin_, a weekly paper which he founded in connexion with George\r\nCanning and William Gifford. For some years before the _Anti-Jacobin_\r\nwas started Ellis had been working in the congenial field of Early\r\nEnglish literature, in which he was one of the first to arouse interest.\r\nThe first edition of his _Specimens of the Early English Poets_ appeared\r\nin 1790; and this was followed by _Specimens of Early English Metrical\r\nRomances_ (1805). He also edited Gregory Lewis Way's translation of\r\nselect _Fabliaux_ in 1796. Ellis was an intimate friend of Sir Walter\r\nScott, who styled him \"the first converser I ever saw,\" and dedicated to\r\nhim the fifth canto of _Marmion_. Some of the correspondence between\r\nthem is to be found in Lockhart's _Life_. He died on the 10th of April\r\n1815. The monument erected to his memory in the parish church of Gunning\r\nHill, Berks, bears a fine inscription by Canning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLIS, SIR HENRY (1777-1869), English antiquary, was born in London on\r\nthe 29th of November 1777. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' school,\r\nand at St John's College, Oxford, of which he was elected a fellow.\r\nAfter having held for a few months a sub-librarianship in the Bodleian,\r\nhe was in 1800 appointed to a similar post in the British Museum. In\r\n1827 he became chief librarian, and held that post until 1856, when he\r\nresigned on account of advancing age. In 1832 William IV. made him a\r\nknight of Hanover, and in the following year he received an English\r\nknighthood. He died on the 15th of January 1869. Sir Henry Ellis's life\r\nwas one of very considerable literary activity. His first work of\r\nimportance was the preparation of a new edition of Brand's _Popular\r\nAntiquities_, which appeared in 1813. In 1816 he was selected by the\r\ncommissioners of public records to write the introduction to Domesday\r\nBook, a task which he discharged with much learning, though several of\r\nhis views have not stood the test of later criticism. His _Original\r\nLetters Illustrative of English History_ (first series, 1824; second\r\nseries, 1827; third series, 1846) are compiled chiefly from manuscripts\r\nin the British Museum and the State Paper Office, and have been of\r\nconsiderable service to historical writers. To the Library of\r\nEntertaining Knowledge he contributed four volumes on the Elgin and\r\nTownley Marbles. Sir Henry was for many years a director and\r\njoint-secretary of the Society of Antiquaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLIS, ROBINSON (1834-   ), English classical scholar, was born at\r\nBarming, near Maidstone, on the 5th of September 1834. He was educated\r\nat Elizabeth College, Guernsey, Rugby, and Balliol College, Oxford. In\r\n1858 he became fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, and in 1870 professor\r\nof Latin at University College, London. In 1876 he returned to Oxford,\r\nwhere from 1883 to 1893 he held the university readership in Latin. In\r\n1893 he succeeded Henry Nettleship as professor. His chief work has been\r\non Catullus, whom he began to study in 1859. His first _Commentary on\r\nCatullus_ (1876) aroused great interest, and called forth a flood of\r\ncriticism. In 1889 appeared a second and enlarged edition, which placed\r\nits author in the first rank of authorities on Catullus. Professor Ellis\r\nquotes largely from the early Italian commentators, maintaining that the\r\nland where the Renaissance originated had done more for scholarship than\r\nis commonly recognized. He has supplemented his critical work by a\r\ntranslation (1871, dedicated to Tennyson) of the poems in the metres of\r\nthe originals. Another author to whom Professor Ellis has devoted many\r\nyears' study is Manilius, the astrological poet. In 1891 he published\r\n_Noctes Manilianae_, a series of dissertations on the _Astronomica_,\r\nwith emendations. He has also treated Avianus, Velleius Paterculus and\r\nthe Christian poet Orientius, whom he edited for the Vienna _Corpus\r\nScriptorum Ecclesiasticorum_. He edited the _Ibis_ of Ovid, the _Aetna_\r\nof the younger Lucilius, and contributed to the _Anecdota Oxoniensia_\r\nvarious unedited Bodleian and other manuscripts. In 1907 he published\r\n_Appendix Vergiliana_ (an edition of the minor poems); in 1908 _The\r\nAnnalist Licinianus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLIS, WILLIAM (1794-1872), English Nonconformist missionary, was born\r\nin London on the 29th of August 1794. His boyhood and youth were spent\r\nat Wisbeach, where he worked as a market-gardener. In 1814 he offered\r\nhimself to the London Missionary Society, and was accepted. During a\r\nyear's training he acquired some knowledge of theology and of various\r\npractical arts, such as printing and bookbinding. He sailed for the\r\nSouth Sea Islands in January 1816, and remained in Polynesia, occupying\r\nvarious stations in succession, until 1824, when he was compelled to\r\nreturn home on account of the state of his wife's health. Though the\r\nperiod of his residence in the islands was thus comparatively short, his\r\nlabours were very fruitful, contributing perhaps as much as those of any\r\nother missionary to bring about the extraordinary improvement in the\r\nreligious, moral and social condition of the Pacific Archipelago that\r\ntook place during the 19th century. Besides promoting the spiritual\r\nobject of his mission, he introduced many other aids to the improvement\r\nof the condition of the people. His gardening experience enabled him\r\nsuccessfully to acclimatize many species of tropical fruits and plants,\r\nand he set up and worked the first printing press in the South Seas.\r\nReturning home by way of the United States, where he advocated his work,\r\nEllis was for some years employed as a travelling agent of the London\r\nMissionary Society, and in 1832 was appointed foreign secretary to the\r\nsociety, an office which he held for seven years. In 1837 he married his\r\nsecond wife, Sarah Stickney, a writer and teacher of some note in her\r\ngeneration. In 1841 he went to live at Hoddesdon, Herts, and ministered\r\nto a small Congregational church there. On behalf of the London\r\nMissionary Society he paid three visits to Madagascar (1853-1857),\r\ninquiring into the prospects for resuming the work that had been\r\nsuspended by Queen Ranavolona's hostility. A further visit was paid in\r\n1863. Ellis wrote accounts of all his travels, and Southey's praise (in\r\nthe _Quarterly Review_) of his _Polynesian Researches_ (2 vols., 1829)\r\nfinds many echoes. He was a fearless, upright and tactful man, and a\r\nkeen observer of nature. He died on the 25th of June 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLISTON, ROBERT WILLIAM (1774-1831), English actor, was born in London\r\non the 7th of April 1774, the son of a watchmaker. He was educated at St\r\nPaul's school, but ran away from home and made his first appearance on\r\nthe stage as Tressel in _Richard III._ at Bath in 1791. Here he was\r\nlater seen as Romeo, and in other leading parts, both comic and tragic,\r\nand he repeated his successes in London from 1796. He acted at Drury\r\nLane from 1804 to 1809, and again from 1812; and from 1819 he was the\r\nlessee of the house, presenting Kean, Mme Vestris and Macready.\r\nIll-health and misfortune culminated in his bankruptcy in 1826, when he\r\nmade his last appearance at Drury Lane as Falstaff. But as lessee of the\r\nSurrey theatre he acted almost up to his death, which was hastened by\r\nintemperance. Leigh Hunt compared him favourably with Garrick; Byron\r\nthought him inimitable in high comedy; Macready praised his versatility.\r\nElliston was the author of _The Venetian Outlaw_ (1805), and, with\r\nFrancis Godolphin Waldron, of _No Prelude_ (1803), in both of which\r\nplays he appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLORA, a village of India in the native state of Hyderabad, near the\r\ncity of Daulatabad, famous for its rock temples, which are among the\r\nfinest in India. They are first mentioned by Ma'sudi, the Arabic\r\ngeographer of the 10th century, but merely as a celebrated place of\r\npilgrimage. The caves differ from those of Ajanta in consequence of\r\ntheir being excavated in the sloping sides of a hill and not in a nearly\r\nperpendicular cliff. They extend along the face of the hill for a mile\r\nand a quarter, and are divided into three distinct series, the Buddhist,\r\nthe Brahmanical and the Jain, and are arranged almost chronologically.\r\nThe most splendid of the whole series is the Kailas, a perfect Dravidian\r\ntemple, complete in all its parts, characterized by Fergusson as one of\r\nthe most wonderful and interesting monuments of architectural art in\r\nIndia. It is not a mere interior chamber cut in the rock, but is a model\r\nof a complete temple such as might have been erected on the plain. In\r\nother words, the rock has been cut away externally as well as\r\ninternally. First the great sunken court measuring 276 ft. by 154 ft.\r\nwas hewn out of the solid trap-rock of the hillside, leaving the rock\r\nmass of the temple wholly detached in a cloistered court like a colossal\r\nboulder, save that a rock bridge once connected the upper storey of the\r\ntemple with the upper row of galleried chambers surrounding three sides\r\nof the court. Colossal elephants and obelisks stand on either side of\r\nthe open mandapam, or pavilion, containing the sacred bull; and beyond\r\nrises the monolithic Dravidian temple to Siva, 90 ft. in height,\r\nhollowed into vestibule, chamber and image-cells, all lavishly carved.\r\nTime and earthquakes have weathered and broken away bits of the great\r\nmonument, and Moslem zealots strove to destroy the carved figures, but\r\nthese defects are hardly noticed. The temple was built by Krishna I.,\r\nRashtrakuta, king of Malkhed in 760-783.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLORE, a town of British India, in the Kistna district of Madras, on\r\nthe East Coast railway, 303 m. from Madras. Pop. (1901) 33,521. The two\r\ncanal systems of the Godavari and the Kistna deltas meet here. There are\r\nmanufactures of cotton and saltpetre, and an important Church of England\r\nhigh school. Ellore was formerly a military station, and the capital of\r\nthe Northern Circars. At Pedda Vegi to the north of it are extensive\r\nruins, which are believed to be remains of the Buddhist kingdom of\r\nVengi. From these the Mahommedans, after their conquest of the district\r\nin 1470, obtained material for building a fort at Ellore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLSWORTH, OLIVER (1745-1807), American statesman and jurist, was born\r\nat Windsor, Connecticut, on the 29th of April 1745. He studied at Yale\r\nand Princeton, graduating from the latter in 1766, studied theology for\r\na year, then law, and began to practise at Hartford in 1771. He was\r\nstate's attorney for Hartford county from 1777 to 1785, and achieved\r\nextraordinary success at the bar, amassing what was for his day a large\r\nfortune. From 1773 to 1775 he represented the town of Windsor in the\r\ngeneral assembly of Connecticut, and in the latter year became a member\r\nof the important commission known as the \"Pay Table,\" which supervised\r\nthe colony's expenditures for military purposes during the War of\r\nIndependence. In 1779 he again sat in the assembly, this time\r\nrepresenting Hartford. From 1777 to 1783 he was a member of the\r\nContinental Congress, and in this body he served on three important\r\ncommittees, the marine committee, the board of treasury, and the\r\ncommittee of appeals, the predecessors respectively of the navy and\r\ntreasury departments and the Supreme Court under the Federal\r\nConstitution. From 1780 to 1785 he was a member of the governor's\r\ncouncil of Connecticut, which, with the lower house before 1784 and\r\nalone from 1784 to 1807, constituted a supreme court of errors; and from\r\n1785 to 1789 he was a judge of the state superior court. In 1787, with\r\nRoger Sherman and William Samuel Johnson (1727-1819), he was one of\r\nConnecticut's delegates to the constitutional convention at\r\nPhiladelphia, in which his services were numerous and important. In\r\nparticular, when disagreement seemed inevitable on the question of\r\nrepresentation, he, with Roger Sherman, proposed what is known as the\r\n\"Connecticut Compromise,\" by which the Federal legislature was made to\r\nconsist of two houses, the upper having equal representation from each\r\nstate, the lower being chosen on the basis of population. Ellsworth also\r\nmade a determined stand against a national paper currency. Being\r\ncompelled to leave the convention before its adjournment, he did not\r\nsign the instrument, but used his influence to secure its ratification\r\nby his native state. From 1789 to 1796 he was one of the first senators\r\nfrom Connecticut under the new Constitution. In the senate he was looked\r\nupon as President Washington's personal spokesman and as the leader of\r\nthe Administration party. His most important service to his country was\r\nwithout a doubt in connexion with the establishment of the Federal\r\njudiciary. As chairman of the committee having the matter in charge, he\r\ndrafted the bill by the enactment of which the system of Federal courts,\r\nalmost as it is to-day, was established. He also took a leading part in\r\nthe senate in securing the passage of laws for funding the national\r\ndebt, assuming the state debts and establishing a United States bank. It\r\nwas Ellsworth who suggested to Washington the sending of John Jay to\r\nEngland to negotiate a new treaty with Great Britain, and he probably\r\ndid more than any other man to induce the senate, despite widespread and\r\nviolent opposition, to ratify that treaty when negotiated. By President\r\nWashington's appointment he became chief justice of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States in March 1796, and in 1799 President John Adams sent\r\nhim, with William Vans Murray (1762-1803) and William R. Davie\r\n(1756-1820), to negotiate a new treaty with France. It was largely\r\nthrough the influence of Ellsworth, who took the principal part in the\r\nnegotiations, that Napoleon consented to a convention, of the 30th of\r\nSeptember 1800, which secured for citizens of the United States their\r\nships captured by France but not yet condemned as prizes, provided for\r\nfreedom of commerce between the two nations, stipulated that \"free ships\r\nshall give a freedom to goods,\" and contained provisions favourable to\r\nneutral commerce. While he was abroad, failing health compelled him\r\n(1800) to resign the chief-justiceship, and after some months in England\r\nhe returned to America in 1801. In 1803 he was again elected to the\r\ngovernor's council, and in 1807, on the reorganization of the\r\nConnecticut judiciary, was appointed chief justice of the new Supreme\r\nCourt. He never took office, however, but died at his home in Windsor on\r\nthe 27th of November 1807.\r\n\r\n  See W.G. Brown's _Oliver Ellsworth_ (New York, 1905), an excellent\r\n  biography. There is also an appreciative account of Ellsworth's life\r\n  and work in H.C. Lodge's _A Fighting Frigate, and Other Essays and\r\n  Addresses_ (New York, 1902), which contains in an appendix an\r\n  interesting letter by Senator George F. Hoar concerning Ellsworth's\r\n  work in the constitutional convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLSWORTH, a city, port of entry and the county seat of Hancock county,\r\nMaine, U.S.A., at the head of navigation on the Union river (and about\r\n3-3/4 m. from its mouth), about 30 m. S.E. of Bangor. Pop. (1890) 4804;\r\n(1900) 4297 (189 foreign-born); (1910) 3549. It is served by the Maine\r\nCentral railway. The fall of the river, about 85 ft. in 2 m., furnishes\r\ngood water-power, and the city has various manufactures, including\r\nlumber, shoes, woollens, sails, carriages and foundry and machine shop\r\nproducts, besides a large lumber trade. Shipbuilding was formerly\r\nimportant. There is a large United States fish hatchery here. The city\r\nis the port of entry for the Frenchman's Bay customs district, but its\r\nforeign trade is unimportant. Ellsworth was first settled in 1763 and\r\nfor some time was called New Bowdoin; but when it was incorporated as a\r\ntown in 1800 the present name was adopted in honour of Oliver Ellsworth.\r\nA city charter was secured in 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELLWANGEN, a town of Germany in the kingdom of Wurttemberg, on the\r\nJagst, 12 m. S.S.E. from Crailsheim on the railway to Goldshofe. Pop.\r\n5000. It is romantically situated between two hills, one crowned by the\r\ncastle of Hohen-Ellwangen, built in 1354 and now used as an agricultural\r\ncollege, and the other, the Schonenberg, by the pilgrimage church of Our\r\nLady of Loreto, in the Jesuit style of architecture. The town possesses\r\none Evangelical and five Roman Catholic churches, among the latter the\r\nStiftskirche, the old abbey church, a Romanesque building dating from\r\n1124, and the Gothic St Wolfgangskirche. The classical and modern\r\nschools (Gymnasium and Realschule) occupy the buildings of a suppressed\r\nJesuit college. The industries include the making of parchment covers,\r\nof envelopes, of wooden hafts and handles for tools, &c., and tanneries.\r\nThere are also a wool-market and a horse-market, the latter famous in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe Benedictine abbey of Ellwangen is said to have been founded in 764\r\nby Herulf, bishop of Langres; there is, however, no record of it before\r\n814. In 1460 the abbey was converted, with the consent of Pope Pius II.,\r\ninto a _Ritterstift_ (college or institution for noble pensioners) under\r\na secular provost, who, in 1555, was raised to the dignity of a prince\r\nof the Empire. The provostship was secularized in 1803 and its\r\nterritories were assigned to Wurttemberg. The town of Ellwangen, which\r\ngrew up round the abbey and received the status of a town about the\r\nmiddle of the 14th century, was until 1803 the capital of the\r\nprovostship.\r\n\r\n  See Seckler, _Beschreibung der gefursteten Probstei Ellwangen_\r\n  (Stuttgart, 1864); _Beschreibung des Oberamts Ellwangen_, published by\r\n  the statistical bureau (Landesamt) at Ellwangen (1888).

He is chiefly celebrated for his connexion with\r\nMilton, and the principal facts of his life are related in a very\r\ninteresting autobiography, which contains much information as to his\r\nintercourse with the poet. While he was still young his father removed\r\nto London, where Thomas became acquainted with a Quaker family named\r\nPennington, and was led to join the Society of Friends, a connexion\r\nwhich subjected him to much persecution. It was through the Penningtons\r\nthat he was introduced in 1662 to Milton in the capacity of Latin\r\nreader. He spent nearly every afternoon in the poet's house in Jewin\r\nStreet, until the intercourse was interrupted by an illness which\r\ncompelled him to go to the country. After a period of imprisonment in\r\nthe old Bridewell prison and in Newgate for Quakerism, Ellwood resumed\r\nhis visits to Milton, who was now residing at a house his friend had\r\ntaken for him at Chalfont St Giles. In 1665 Ellwood was again arrested\r\nand imprisoned in Aylesbury gaol. When he visited Milton after his\r\nrelease the poet gave him the manuscript of the _Paradise Lost_ to read.\r\nOn returning the manuscript Ellwood said, \"Thou hast said much here of\r\nParadise lost; but what hast thou to say of Paradise found?\" and when\r\nMilton long afterwards in London showed him _Paradise Regained_, it was\r\nwith the remark, \"This is owing to you, for you put it into my head at\r\nChalfont.\" Ellwood was the friend of Fox and Penn, and was the author of\r\nseveral polemical works in defence of the Quaker position, of which\r\n_Forgery no Christianity_ (1674) and _The Foundation of Tithes Shaken_\r\n(1678) deserve mention. His _Sacred Histories of the Old and New\r\nTestaments_ appeared in 1705 and 1709. He also published some volumes of\r\npoems, among them a _Davideis_ in five books. He died on the 1st of\r\nMarch 1714.\r\n\r\n  _The History of the Life of Thomas Ellwood: written by his own hand_\r\n  (1714) has been many times reprinted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELM, the popular name for the trees and shrubs constituting the genus\r\n_Ulmus_, of the natural order Ulmaceae. The genus contains fifteen or\r\nsixteen species widely distributed throughout the north temperate zone,\r\nwith the exception of western North America, and extending southwards as\r\nfar as Mexico in the New and the Sikkim Himalayas in the Old World.\r\n\r\nThe common elm, _U. campestris_, a doubtful native of England, is found\r\nthroughout a great part of Europe, in North Africa and in Asia Minor,\r\nwhence it ranges as far east as north Asia and Japan. It grows in woods\r\nand hedge-rows, especially in the southern portion of Britain, and on\r\nalmost all soils, but thrives best on a rich loam, in open, low-lying,\r\nmoderately moist situations, attaining a height of 60 to 100, and in\r\nsome few cases as much as 130 or 150 ft. The branches are numerous and\r\nspreading, and often pendulous at the extremities; the bark is rugged;\r\nthe leaves are alternate, ovate, rough, doubly serrate, and, as in other\r\nspecies of _Ulmus_, unequal at the base. The flowers are small,\r\nhermaphrodite, numerous, in purplish-brown tufts, and each with a\r\nfringed basal bract; the bell-shaped calyx is often four-toothed and\r\nsurrounds four free stamens; the pistil bears two spreading hairy\r\nstyles. They appear before the leaves in March and April. The\r\nseed-vessels are green, membranous, one-seeded and deeply cleft. Unlike\r\nthe wych elm, the common elm rarely perfects its seed in England, where\r\nit is propagated by means of root suckers from old trees, or preferably\r\nby layers from stools. In the first ten years of its growth it\r\nordinarily reaches a height of 25 to 30 ft. The wood, at first brownish\r\nwhite, becomes, with growth, of a brown colour having a greenish shade.\r\nIt is close-grained, free from knots, without apparent medullary rays,\r\nand is hard and tough, but will not take a polish. All parts of the\r\ntrunk, including the sapwood, are available in carpentry. By drying, the\r\nwood loses over 60% of its weight, and has then a specific gravity of\r\n0.588. It has considerable transverse strength, does not crack when once\r\nseasoned, and is remarkably durable under water, or if kept quite dry;\r\nthough it decays rapidly on exposure to the weather, which in ten to\r\neighteen months causes the bark to fall off, and gives to the wood a\r\nyellowish colour--a sign of deterioration in quality. To prevent\r\nshrinking and warping it may be preserved in water or mud, but it is\r\nbest worked up soon after felling. Analyses of the ash of the wood have\r\ngiven a percentage of 47.8% of lime, 21.9% of potash, and 13.7% of soda.\r\nIn summer, elm trees often exude an alkaline gummy substance, which by\r\nthe action of the air becomes the brown insoluble body termed _ulmin_.\r\nElm wood is used for keels and bilge-planks, the blocks and dead-eyes of\r\nrigging, and ships' pumps, for coffins, wheels, furniture, carved and\r\nturned articles, and for general carpenters' work; and previous to the\r\ncommon employment of cast iron was much in request for waterpipes. The\r\ninner bark of the elm is made into bast mats and ropes. It contains\r\nmucilage, with a little tannic acid, and was formerly much employed for\r\nthe preparation of an antiscorbutic decoction, now obsolete. The bark of\r\n_Ulmus fulva_, the slippery or red elm of the United States and Canada,\r\nserves the North American Indians for the same purpose, and also as a\r\nvulnerary. The leaves as well as the young shoots of elms have been\r\nfound a suitable food for live stock. For ornamental purposes elm trees\r\nare frequently planted, and in avenues, as at the park of\r\nStratfieldsaye, in Hampshire, are highly effective. They were first used\r\nin France for the adornment of public walks in the reign of Francis I.\r\nIn Italy, as in ancient times, it is still customary to train the vine\r\nupon the elm--a practice to which frequent allusion has been made by the\r\npoets. The cork-barked elm, _U. campestris_, var. _suberosa_, is\r\ndistinguished chiefly by the thick deeply fissured bark with which its\r\nbranches are covered. There are numerous cultivated forms differing in\r\nsize and shape of leaf, and manner of growth.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch or wych elm, _U. montana_, is indigenous to Britain and is\r\nthe common elm of the northern portion of the island; it usually attains\r\na height of about 50 ft., but among tall-growing trees may reach 120 ft.\r\nIt has drooping branches and a smoother and thinner bark, larger and\r\nmore tapering leaves, and a far less deeply notched seed-vessel than _U.\r\ncampestris_. The wood, though more porous than in that species, is a\r\ntough and hard material when properly seasoned, and, being very flexible\r\nwhen steamed, is well adapted for boat-building. Branches of the wych\r\nelm were formerly manufactured into bows, and if forked were employed as\r\ndivining-rods. The weeping elm, the most ornamental member of the genus,\r\nis a variety of this species. The Dutch or sand elm is a tree very\r\nsimilar to the wych elm, but produces inferior timber. The American or\r\nwhite elm, _U. americana_, is a hardy and very handsome species, of\r\nwhich the old tree on Boston (Mass.) Common was a representative. This\r\ntree is supposed to have been in existence before the settlement of\r\nBoston, and at the time of its destruction by the storm of the 15th of\r\nFebruary 1876 measured 22 ft. in circumference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELMACIN (ELMAKIN or ELMACINUS), GEORGE (c. 1223-1274), author of a\r\nhistory of the Saracens, which extends from the time of Mahomet to the\r\nyear 1118 of our era. He was a Christian of Egypt, where he was born; is\r\nknown in the east as Ibn-Amid; and after holding an official position\r\nunder the sultans of Egypt, died at Damascus. His history is principally\r\noccupied with the affairs of the Saracen empire, but it contains\r\npassages which relate to the Eastern Christians. It was published in\r\nArabic and Latin at Leiden in 1625. The Latin version is a translation\r\nby Erpenius, under the title, _Historia saracenica_, and from this a\r\nFrench translation was made by Wattier as _L'Histoire mahometane_\r\n(Paris, 1657).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELMALI (\"apple-town\"), a small town of Asia Minor in the vilayet of\r\nKonia, the present administrative centre of the ancient Lycia, but not\r\nitself corresponding to any known ancient city. It lies about 25 m.\r\ninland, at the head of a long upland valley (5000 ft.) inhabited by\r\ndirect descendants of the ancient Lycians, who have preserved a\r\ndistinctive facial type, noticeable at once in the town population.\r\nThere are about fifty Greek families, the rest of the population (4000)\r\nbeing Moslem. The district is agricultural and has no manufactures of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELMES, HARVEY LONSDALE (1813-1847), British architect, son of James\r\nElmes (q.v.), was born at Chichester in 1813. After serving some time in\r\nhis father's office, and under a surveyor at Bedford and an architect at\r\nBath, he became partner with his father in 1835, and in the following\r\nyear he was successful among 86 competitors for a design for St George's\r\nHall, Liverpool. The foundation stone of this building was laid en the\r\n28th of June 1838, but, Elmes being successful in a competition for the\r\nAssize Courts in the same city, it was finally decided to include the\r\nhall and courts in a single building. In accordance with this idea,\r\nElmes prepared a fresh design, and the work of erection commenced in\r\n1841. He superintended its progress till 1847, when from failing health\r\nhe was compelled to delegate his duties to Charles Robert Cockerell, and\r\nleave for Jamaica, where he died of consumption on the 26th of November\r\n1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELMES, JAMES (1782-1862), British architect, civil engineer, and writer\r\non the arts, was born in London on the 15th of October 1782. He was\r\neducated at Merchant Taylors' school, and, after studying building under\r\nhis father, and architecture under George Gibson, became a student at\r\nthe Royal Academy, where he gained the silver medal in 1804. He designed\r\na large number of buildings in the metropolis, and was surveyor and\r\ncivil engineer to the port of London, but is best known as a writer on\r\nthe arts. In 1809 he became vice-president of the Royal Architectural\r\nSociety, but this office, as well as that of surveyor of the port of\r\nLondon, he was compelled through partial loss of sight to resign in\r\n1828. He died at Greenwich on the 2nd of April 1862. His publications\r\nwere:--_Sir Christopher Wren and his Times_ (1823); _Lectures on\r\nArchitecture_ (1823); _The Arts and Artists_ (1825); _General and\r\nBiographical Dictionary of the Fine Arts_ (1826); _Treatise on\r\nArchitectural Jurisprudence_ (1827), and _Thomas Clarkson: a Monograph_\r\n(1854).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELMHAM, THOMAS (d. c. 1420), English chronicler, was probably born at\r\nNorth Elmham in Norfolk. He became a Benedictine monk at Canterbury, and\r\nthen joining the Cluniacs, was prior of Lenton Abbey, near Nottingham;\r\nhe was chaplain to Henry V., whom he accompanied to France in 1415,\r\nbeing present at Agincourt. Elmham wrote a history of the monastery of\r\nSt Augustine at Canterbury, which has been edited by C. Hardwick for the\r\nRolls Series (1858); and a _Liber metricus de Henrico V._, edited by\r\nC.A. Cole in the _Memorials of Henry V._ (1858). It is very probable\r\nthat Elmham wrote the famous _Gesta Henrici Quinti_, which is the best\r\nauthority for the life of Henry V. from his accession to 1416. This\r\nwork, often referred to as the \"chaplain's life,\" and thought by some to\r\nhave been written by Jean de Bordin, has been published for the English\r\nHistorical Society by B. Williams (1850). Elmham, however, did not write\r\nthe _Vita et Gesta Henrici V._, which was attributed to him by T. Hearne\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n  See C.L. Kingsford, _Henry V._ (1901).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELMINA, a town on the Gold Coast, British West Africa, in 5 deg. 4' N.,\r\n1 deg. 20' W. and about 8 m. W. of Cape Coast. Pop. about 4000. Facing\r\nthe Atlantic on a rocky peninsula is Fort St George, considered the\r\nfinest fort on the Guinea coast. It is built square with high walls, and\r\nhas accommodation for 200 soldiers. On the land side were formerly two\r\nmoats, cut in the rock on which the castle stands. The castle is the\r\nresidence of the commissioner of the district and other officials. The\r\nhouses in the native quarter are mostly built of stone, that material\r\nbeing plentiful in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nElmina is the earliest European settlement on the Gold Coast, and was\r\nvisited by the Portuguese in 1481. Christopher Columbus is believed to\r\nhave been one of the officers who took part in this voyage. The\r\nPortuguese at once began to build the castle now known as Fort St\r\nGeorge, but it was not completed till eighty years afterwards. Another\r\ndefensive work is Fort St Jago, built in 1666, which is behind the town\r\nand at some distance from the coast. (In the latter half of the 19th\r\ncentury it was converted into a prison.) Elmina was captured by the\r\nDutch in 1637, and ceded to them by treaty in 1640. They made it the\r\nchief port for the produce of Ashanti. With the other Dutch possessions\r\non the Guinea coast, it was transferred to Great Britain in April 1872.\r\nThe king of Ashanti, claiming to be ground landlord, objected to its\r\ntransfer, and the result was the Ashanti war of 1873-1874. For many\r\nyears the greatest output of gold from this coast came from Elmina. The\r\nannual export is said to have been nearly L3,000,000 in the early years\r\nof the 18th century, but the figure is probably exaggerated. Since 1900\r\nthe bulk of the export trade in gold has been transferred to Sekondi\r\n(q.v.). Prempeh, the ex-king of Ashanti, was detained in the castle\r\n(1896) until his removal to the Seychelles. (See ASHANTI: _History_, and\r\nGOLD COAST: _History_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELMIRA, a city and the county-seat of Chemung county, New York, U.S.A.,\r\n100 m. S.E. of Rochester, on the Chemung river, about 850 ft. above\r\nsea-level. Pop. (1890) 30,893; (1900) 35,672, of whom 5511 were\r\nforeign-born (1988 Irish and 1208 German); (1910 census) 37,176. It is\r\nserved by the Erie, the Pennsylvania, the Delaware, Lackawanna &\r\nWestern, the Lehigh Valley, and the Tioga Division railways, the last of\r\nwhich connects it with the Pennsylvania coalfields 48 m. away. The city\r\nis attractively situated on both sides of the river, and has a fine\r\nwater-supply and park system, among the parks being Eldridge, Rorick's\r\nGlen, Riverside, Brand, Diven, Grove, Maple Avenue and Wisner; in the\r\nlast-named is a statue of Thomas K. Beecher by J.S. Hartley. The city\r\ncontains a Federal building, a state armoury, the Chemung county court\r\nhouse and other county buildings, the Elmira orphans' home, the Steele\r\nmemorial library, home for the aged, the Arnot-Ogden memorial hospital,\r\nthe Elmira free academy, and the Railway Commercial training school.\r\nHere, also, is Elmira College (Presbyterian) for women, founded in 1855.\r\nThis institution, chartered in 1852 as Auburn Female University and then\r\nsituated in Auburn, was rechartered in 1855 as the Elmira Female\r\nCollege; it was established largely through the influence and persistent\r\nefforts of the Rev. Samuel Robbins Brown (1810-1880) and his associates,\r\nnotably Simeon Benjamin of Elmira, who gave generously to the newly\r\nfounded college, and was the first distinctively collegiate institution\r\nfor women in the United States, and the first, apparently, to grant\r\ndegrees to women. The most widely known institution in the city is the\r\nElmira reformatory, a state prison for first offenders between the ages\r\nof sixteen and thirty, on a system of general indeterminate sentences.\r\nAuthorized by the state legislature in 1866 and opened in 1876 under the\r\ndirection of Zebulon Reed Brockway (b. 1827), it was the first\r\ninstitution of the sort and has served as a model for many similar\r\ninstitutions both in the United States and in other countries (see\r\nJUVENILE OFFENDERS). Elmira is an important railway centre, with large\r\nrepair shops, and has also extensive manufactories (value of production\r\nin 1900, $8,558,786, of which $6,596,603 was produced under the \"factory\r\nsystem\"; in 1905, under the \"factory system,\" $6,984,095), including\r\nboot and shoe factories, a large factory for fire-extinguishing\r\napparatus, iron and steel bridge works, steel rolling mills, large valve\r\nworks, steel plate mills, knitting mills, furniture, glass and boiler\r\nfactories, breweries and silk mills. Near the site of Elmira occurred on\r\nthe 29th of August 1779 the battle of Newtown, in which General John\r\nSullivan decisively defeated a force of Indians and Tories under Sir\r\nJohn Johnson and Joseph Brant. There were some settlers here at the\r\nclose of the War of Independence, but no permanent settlement was made\r\nuntil 1788. The village was incorporated as Newtown in 1815, and was\r\nreincorporated as Elmira in 1828. A city charter was secured in 1864. In\r\n1861 a state military camp was established here, and in 1864-1865 there\r\nwas a prison camp here for Confederate soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELMSHORN, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, on the Kruckau, 19 m. by rail N.W. from Altona. Pop.\r\n(1905) 13,640. Its industries include weaving, dyeing, brewing,\r\niron-founding and the manufacture of leather goods, boots and shoes and\r\nmachines. There is a considerable shipping trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELMSLEY, PETER (1773-1825), English classical scholar. He was educated\r\nat Westminster and Christ Church, Oxford, and having inherited a fortune\r\nfrom his uncle, a well-known bookseller, devoted himself to the study of\r\nclassical authors and manuscripts. In 1798 he was appointed to the\r\nchapelry of Little Horkesley in Essex, which he held till his death. He\r\ntravelled extensively in France and Italy, and spent the winter of 1818\r\nin examining the MSS. in the Laurentian library at Florence. In 1819 he\r\nwas commissioned, with Sir Humphry Davy, to decipher the papyri found at\r\nHerculaneum, but the results proved insignificant. In 1823 he was\r\nappointed principal of St Alban's Hall, Oxford, and Camden professor of\r\nancient history. He died in Oxford on the 8th of March 1825. Elmsley was\r\na man of most extensive learning and European reputation, and was\r\nconsidered to be the best ecclesiastical scholar in England. But it is\r\nchiefly by his collation of the MSS. of the Greek tragedians and his\r\ncritical labours on the restoration of their text that he will be\r\nremembered. He edited the _Acharnians_ of Aristophanes, and several of\r\nthe plays and scholia of Sophocles and Euripides. He was the first to\r\nrecognize the importance of the Laurentian MS. (see Sandys, _Hist. of\r\nClass. Schol._ iii. (1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELNE, a town of south-western France in the department of\r\nPyrenees-Orientales, 10 m. S.S.E. of Perpignan by rail. Pop. (1906)\r\n3026. The hill on which it stands, once washed by the sea, which is now\r\nover 3 m. distant, commands a fine view over the plain of Roussillon.\r\nFrom the 6th century till 1602 the town was the seat of a bishopric,\r\nwhich was transferred to Perpignan. The cathedral of St Eulalie, a\r\nRomanesque building completed about the beginning of the 12th century,\r\nhas a beautiful cloister in the same style, with interesting sculptures\r\nand three early Christian sarcophagi. Remains of the ancient ramparts\r\nflanked by towers are still to be seen. Silk-worm cultivation is carried\r\non. Elne, the ancient _Illiberis_, was named _Helena_ by the emperor\r\nConstantine in memory of his mother. Hannibal encamped under its walls\r\non his march to Rome in 218 B.C. The emperor Constans was assassinated\r\nthere in A.D. 350. The town several times sustained siege and capture\r\nbetween its occupation by the Moors in the 8th century and its\r\ncapitulation in 1641 to the troops of Louis XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL OBEID, chief town of the mudiria (province) of Kordofan,\r\nAnglo-Egyptian Sudan, and 230 m. S.W. by S. of Khartum in a direct\r\nline. Pop. (1905) about 10,000. It is situated about 2000 ft. above the\r\nsea, at the northern foot of Jebel Kordofan, in 13 deg. 11' N. and 30\r\ndeg. 14' E. It is an important trade centre, the chief articles of\r\ncommerce being gum, ivory, cattle and ostrich feathers. A considerable\r\npart of the trade of Darfur with Egypt passes through El Obeid.\r\n\r\nEl Obeid, which appears to be a place of considerable antiquity and the\r\nancient capital of the country, was garrisoned by the Egyptians on their\r\nconquest of Kordofan in 1821. In September 1882 the town was assaulted\r\nby the troops of the mahdi, who, being repulsed, laid siege to the\r\nplace, which capitulated on the 17th of January 1883. During the Mahdia\r\nthe city was destroyed and deserted, and when Kordofan passed, in 1899,\r\ninto the possession of the Anglo-Egyptian authorities nothing was left\r\nof El Obeid but a part of the old government offices. A new town was\r\nlaid out in squares, the mudiria repaired and barracks built. (See\r\nKORDOFAN, and SUDAN: _Anglo-Egyptian_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELOI [ELIGIUS], SAINT (588-659), apostle of the Belgians and Frisians,\r\nwas born at Cadillac, near Limoges, in 588. Having at an early age shown\r\nartistic talent he was placed by his parents with the master of the mint\r\nat Limoges, where he made rapid progress in goldsmith's work. He became\r\ncoiner to Clotaire II., king of the Franks, and treasurer to his\r\nsuccessor Dagobert. Both kings entrusted him with important works, among\r\nwhich were the composition of the bas-reliefs which ornament the tomb of\r\nSt Germain, bishop of Paris, and the execution (for Clotaire) of two\r\nchairs of gold, adorned with jewels, which at that time were reckoned\r\n_chefs-d'oeuvre_. Though he was amassing great wealth, Eloi acquired a\r\ndistaste for a worldly life, and resolved to become a priest. At first\r\nhe retired to a monastery, but in 640 was raised to the bishopric of\r\nNoyon. He made frequent missionary excursions to the pagans of the Low\r\nCountries, and also founded a great many monasteries and churches. He\r\ndied on the 1st of December 659. A mass of legend has gathered round the\r\nlife of St Eloi, who as the patron saint of goldsmiths is still very\r\npopular.\r\n\r\n  His life was written by his friend and contemporary St Ouen\r\n  (Audoenus); French translations of the _Vita S. Eligii auctore\r\n  Audoeno_ were published by L. de Montigny (Paris, 1626), by C.\r\n  Barthelemy in _Etudes hist., litt. et art._ (_ib._ 1847), and by\r\n  Parenty, with notes (2nd ed., ib. 1870). For bibliography see\r\n  Potthast, _Bibliotheca hist. med. aevi_ (Berlin, 1896), s.v. \"Vita S.\r\n  Eligii Noviomensis,\" and Ulysse Chevalier, _Rep. des sources hist.,\r\n  Bio-bibl._ (Paris, 1894), s. \"Eloi.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELONGATION, strictly \"lengthening\"; in astronomy, the apparent angular\r\ndistance of a heavenly body from its centre of motion, as seen from the\r\nearth; designating especially the angular distance of the planet Mercury\r\nor Venus from the sun, or the apparent angle between a satellite and its\r\nprimary. The greatest elongation of Venus is about 45 deg.; that of\r\nMercury generally ranges between 18 deg. and 27 deg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL PASO, a city, port of entry, and the county-seat of El Paso county,\r\nTexas, U.S.A., on the E. bank of the Rio Grande, in the extreme W. part\r\nof the state, at an altitude of 3710 ft. Pop. (1880) 736; (1890) 10,338;\r\n(1900) 15,906, of whom 6309 were foreign-born and 466 were negroes;\r\n(1910 census) 39,279. Many of the inhabitants are of Mexican descent. El\r\nPaso is an important railway centre and is served by the following\r\nrailways: the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe, of which it is the S.\r\nterminus; the El Paso & South-Western, which connects with the Chicago,\r\nRock Island & El Paso (of the Rock Island system); the Galveston,\r\nHarrisburg & San Antonio, of which it is the W. terminus; the Mexican\r\nCentral, of which it is the N. terminus; the Texas & Pacific, of which\r\nit is the W. terminus; a branch of the Southern Pacific, of which it is\r\nthe E. terminus; and the short Rio Grande, Sierra Madre & Pacific, of\r\nwhich it is the N. terminus. The city is regularly laid out on level\r\nbottom lands, stretching to the table-lands and slopes to the N.E. and\r\nN.W. of the city. Opposite, on the W. bank of the river, is the Mexican\r\ntown of Ciudad Juarez (until 1885 known as Paso del Norte), with which\r\nEl Paso is connected by bridges and by electric railway. The climate is\r\nmild, warm and dry, El Paso being well known as a health resort,\r\nparticularly for sufferers from pulmonary complaints. Among the city's\r\npublic buildings are a handsome Federal building, a county court house,\r\na city hall, a Y.M.C.A. building, a public library, a sanatorium for\r\nconsumptives, and the Hotel Dieu, a hospital maintained by Roman\r\nCatholics. El Paso is the seat of St Joseph's Academy and of the El Paso\r\nMilitary Institute. Three miles E. of the city limits is Fort Bliss, a\r\nU.S. military post, with a reservation of about 2 sq. m. El Paso's\r\nsituation on the Mexican frontier gives it a large trade with Mexico; it\r\nis the port of entry of the Paso del Norte customs district, one of the\r\nlarger Mexican border districts, and in 1908 its imports were valued at\r\n$2,677,784 and its exports at $5,661,901. Wheat, boots and shoes, mining\r\nmachinery, cement, lime, lumber, beer, and denatured alcohol are among\r\nthe varied exports; the principal imports are ore, sugar, cigars,\r\noranges, drawn work and Mexican curios. El Paso has extensive\r\nmanufactories, especially railway car shops, which in 1905 employed\r\n34.5% of the factory wage-earners. Just outside the city limits are\r\nimportant lead smelting works, to which are brought ores for treatment\r\nfrom western Texas, northern Mexico, New Mexico and Arizona. Among the\r\ncity's manufactures are cement, denatured alcohol, ether, varnish,\r\nclothing and canned goods. The value of the city's total factory product\r\nin 1905 was $2,377,813, 96% greater than that in 1900. El Paso lies in a\r\nfertile agricultural valley, and in 1908 the erection of an immense dam\r\nwas begun near Engle, New Mexico (100 m. above El Paso), by the U.S.\r\ngovernment, to store the flood waters of the Rio Grande for irrigating\r\nthis area. Before the Mexican War, following which the first United\r\nStates settlement was made, the site of El Paso was known as Ponce de\r\nLeon Ranch, the land being owned by the Ponce de Leon family. El Paso\r\nwas first chartered as a city in 1873, and in 1907 adopted the\r\ncommission form of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELPHINSTONE, MOUNTSTUART (1779-1859), Indian statesman and historian,\r\nfourth son of the 11th Baron Elphinstone in the peerage of Scotland, was\r\nborn in 1779. Having received an appointment in the civil service of the\r\nEast India Company, of which one of his uncles was a director, he\r\nreached Calcutta in the beginning of 1796. After filling several\r\nsubordinate posts, he was appointed in 1801 assistant to the British\r\nresident at Poona, at the court of the peshwa, the most powerful of the\r\nMahratta princes. Here he obtained his first opportunity of distinction,\r\nbeing attached in the capacity of diplomatist to the mission of Sir\r\nArthur Wellesley to the Mahrattas. When, on the failure of negotiations,\r\nwar broke out, Elphinstone, though a civilian, acted as virtual\r\naide-de-camp to General Wellesley. He was present at the battle of\r\nAssaye, and displayed such courage and knowledge of tactics throughout\r\nthe whole campaign that Wellesley told him he had mistaken his\r\nprofession, and that he ought to have been a soldier. In 1804, when the\r\nwar closed, he was appointed British resident at Nagpur. Here, the times\r\nbeing uneventful and his duties light, he occupied much of his leisure\r\nin reading classical and general literature, and acquired those studious\r\nhabits which clung to him throughout life. In 1808 he was appointed the\r\nfirst British envoy to the court of Kabul, with the object of securing a\r\nfriendly alliance with the Afghans; but this proved of little value,\r\nbecause Shah Shuja was driven from the throne by his brother before it\r\ncould be ratified. The most valuable permanent result of the embassy was\r\nthe literary fruit it bore several years afterwards in Elphinstone's\r\ngreat work on Kabul. After spending about a year in Calcutta arranging\r\nthe report of his mission, Elphinstone was appointed in 1811 to the\r\nimportant and difficult post of resident at Poona. The difficulty arose\r\nfrom the general complication of Mahratta politics, and especially from\r\nthe weak and treacherous character of the peshwa, which Elphinstone\r\nrightly read from the first. While the mask of friendship was kept up\r\nElphinstone carried out the only suitable policy, that of vigilant\r\nquiescence, with admirable tact and patience; when in 1817 the mask was\r\nthrown aside and the peshwa ventured to declare war, the English\r\nresident proved for the second time the truth of Wellesley's assertion\r\nthat he was born a soldier. Though his own account of his share in the\r\ncampaign is characteristically modest, one can gather from it that the\r\nsuccess of the British troops was chiefly owing to his assuming the\r\ncommand at an important crisis during the battle of Kirkee.\r\n\r\nThe peshwa being driven from his throne, his territories were annexed to\r\nthe British dominions, and Elphinstone was nominated commissioner to\r\nadminister them. He discharged the responsible task with rare judgment\r\nand ability. In 1819 he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Bombay and\r\nheld this post till 1827, his principal achievement being the\r\ncompilation of the \"Elphinstone code.\" He may fairly be regarded as the\r\nfounder of the system of state education in India, and he probably did\r\nmore than any other Indian administrator to further every likely scheme\r\nfor the promotion of native education. His connexion with the Bombay\r\npresidency was appropriately commemorated in the endowment of the\r\nElphinstone College by the native communities, and in the erection of a\r\nmarble statue by the European inhabitants.\r\n\r\nReturning to England in 1829, after an interval of two years' travel,\r\nElphinstone retained in his retirement and enfeebled health an important\r\ninfluence on public affairs. He twice refused the offer of the\r\ngovernor-generalship of India. Long before his return he had made his\r\nreputation as an author by his _Account of the Kingdom of Cabul and its\r\nDependencies in Persia and India_ (1815). Soon after his arrival in\r\nEngland he commenced the preparation of a work of wider scope, a history\r\nof India, which was published in 1841. It embraces the Hindu and\r\nMahommedan periods, and is still a work of high authority. He died on\r\nthe 20th of November 1859.\r\n\r\n  See J.S. Cotton, _Mountstuart Elphinstone_ (\"Rulers of India\" series),\r\n  (1892); T.E. Colebrooke, _Life of Mountstuart Elphinstone_ (1884); and\r\n  G.W. Forrest, _Official Writings of Mountstuart Elphinstone_ (1884).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELPHINSTONE, WILLIAM (1431-1514), Scottish statesman and prelate,\r\nfounder of the university of Aberdeen, was born in Glasgow, and educated\r\nat the university of his native city, taking the degree of M.A. in 1452.\r\nAfter practising for a short time as a lawyer in the church courts, he\r\nwas ordained priest, becoming rector of St Michael's church, Trongate,\r\nGlasgow, in 1465. Four years later he went to continue his studies at\r\nthe university of Paris, where he became reader in canon law, and then,\r\nproceeding to Orleans, became lecturer in the university there. Before\r\n1474 he had returned to Scotland, and was made rector of the university,\r\nand official of the see of Glasgow. Further promotion followed, but soon\r\nmore important duties were entrusted to Elphinstone, who was made bishop\r\nof Ross in 1481. He was a member of the Scots parliament, and was sent\r\nby King James III. on diplomatic errands to Louis XI. of France, and to\r\nEdward IV. of England; in 1483 he was appointed bishop of Aberdeen,\r\nalthough his consecration was delayed for four years; and he was sent on\r\nmissions to England, both before and after the death of Richard III. in\r\n1485. Although he attended the meetings of parliament with great\r\nregularity he did not neglect his episcopal duties, and the fabric of\r\nthe cathedral of Aberdeen owes much to his care. Early in 1488 the\r\nbishop was made lord high chancellor, but on the king's death in the\r\nfollowing June he vacated this office, and retired to Aberdeen. As a\r\ndiplomatist of repute, however, his services were quickly required by\r\nthe new king, James IV., in whose interests he visited the kings of\r\nEngland and France, and the German king, Maximilian I. Having been made\r\nkeeper of the privy seal in 1492, and having arranged a dispute between\r\nthe Scotch and the Dutch, the bishop's concluding years were mainly\r\nspent in the foundation of the university of Aberdeen. The papal bull\r\nfor this purpose was obtained in 1494, and the royal charter which made\r\nold Aberdeen the seat of a university is dated 1498. A small endowment\r\nwas provided by the king, and the university, modelled on that of Paris\r\nand intended principally to be a school of law, soon became the most\r\nfamous and popular of the Scots seats of learning, a result which was\r\nlargely due to the wide experience and ripe wisdom of Elphinstone and of\r\nhis friend, Hector Boece, the first rector. The building of the college\r\nof the Holy Virgin in Nativity, now King's College, was completed in\r\n1506, and the bishop also rebuilt the choir of his cathedral, and built\r\na bridge over the Dee. Continuing to participate in public affairs he\r\nopposed the policy of hostility towards England which led to the\r\ndisaster at Flodden in September 1513, and died in Edinburgh on the 25th\r\nof October 1514. Elphinstone was partly responsible for the introduction\r\nof printing into Scotland, and for the production of the _Breviarium\r\nAberdonense_. He may have written some of the lives in this collection,\r\nand gathered together materials concerning the history of Scotland; but\r\nhe did not, as some have thought, continue the _Scotichronicon_, nor did\r\nhe write the _Lives of Scottish Saints_.\r\n\r\n  See Hector Boece, _Murthlacensium et Aberdonensium episcoporum vitae_,\r\n  edited and translated by J. Moir (Aberdeen, 1894); _Fasti\r\n  Aberdonenses_, edited by C. Innes (Aberdeen, 1854); and A. Gardyne,\r\n  _Theatre of Scottish Worthies and Lyf of W. Elphinston_, edited by D.\r\n  Laing (Aberdeen, 1878).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL RENO, a city and the county-seat of Canadian county, Oklahoma,\r\nU.S.A., on the N. fork of the Canadian river, about 26 m. W. of Oklahoma\r\nCity. Pop. (1890) 285; (1900) 3383; (1907) 5370 (401 were of negro\r\ndescent and 7 were Indians); (1910) 7872. It is served by the Chicago,\r\nRock Island & Pacific, the Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf (owned by the\r\nChicago, Rock Island & Pacific), and the St Louis, El Reno & Western\r\nrailways, the last extending from El Reno to Guthrie. El Reno lies on\r\nthe rolling prairie lands, about 1360 ft. above the sea, in an Indian\r\ncorn, wheat, oats and cotton-producing and dairying region, and has a\r\nlarge grain elevator, a cotton compress, and various manufacturing\r\nestablishments, among the products being flour, canned goods and\r\ncrockery. El Reno has a Carnegie library, and within the city's limits\r\nis Bellamy's Lake (180 acres), a favourite resort. Near the city is a\r\nGovernment boarding school for the Indians of the Cheyenne and the\r\nArapahoe Reservation. Fort Reno, a U.S. military post, was established\r\nnear El Reno in 1876, and in 1908 became a supply depot of the\r\nquartermaster's department under the name of \"Fort Reno Remount Depot.\"\r\nThe first settlement here, apart from the fort, was made in the autumn\r\nof 1889; in 1892 El Reno received a city charter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELSFLETH, a maritime town of Germany, in the grand-duchy of Oldenburg,\r\nin a fertile district at the confluence of the Hunte with the Weser, on\r\nthe railway Hude-Nordenham. Pop. 2000. It has an Evangelical church, a\r\nschool of navigation, a harbour and docks. It has considerable trade in\r\ncorn and timber and is one of the centres of the North Sea herring\r\nfishery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELSINORE (Dan. _Helsingor_), a seaport of Denmark in the _amt_ (county)\r\nof Frederiksborg, on the east coast of the island of Zealand, 28 m. N.\r\nof Copenhagen by rail. Pop. (1901) 13,902. It stands at the narrowest\r\npart of the Sound, opposite the Swedish town of Helsingborg, 3 m.\r\ndistant. Communication is maintained by means of a steam ferry. Its\r\nharbour admits vessels of 20 ft. draught, and the roadstead affords\r\nexcellent anchorage. There are shipbuilding yards, with foundry,\r\nengineering shops, &c.; the chief export is agricultural produce;\r\nimports, iron, coal, cereals and yarn. Helsingor received\r\ntown-privileges in 1425. In 1522 it was taken and burnt by Lubeck, but\r\nin 1535 was retaken by Christian II. It is celebrated as the Elsinore of\r\nShakespeare's tragedy of _Hamlet_, and was the birthplace of Saxo\r\nGrammaticus, from whose history the story of Hamlet is derived. A pile\r\nof rocks surrounded by trees is shown as the grave of Hamlet, and\r\nOphelia's brook is also pointed out, but both are, of course,\r\ninventions. On a tongue of land east of the town stands the castle of\r\nKronberg or Kronenberg, a magnificent, solid and venerable Gothic\r\nstructure built by Frederick II. towards the end of the 16th century,\r\nand extensively restored by Christian IV. after a fire in 1637. It was\r\ntaken by the Swedes in 1658, but its possession was again given up to\r\nthe Danes in 1660. From its turrets, one of which serves as a\r\nlighthouse, there are fine views of the straits and of the neighbouring\r\ncountries. The Flag Battery is the \"platform before the castle\" where\r\nthe ghost appears in _Hamlet_. Within it the principal object of\r\ninterest is the apartment in which Matilda, queen of Christian VII. and\r\nsister of George III. of England, was imprisoned before she was taken to\r\nHanover. The chapel contains fine wood-carving of the 17th century.\r\nNorth-west of the town is Marienlyst, originally a royal chateau, but\r\nnow a seaside resort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELSSLER, FANNY (1810-1884), Austrian dancer, was born in Vienna on the\r\n23rd of June 1810. From her earliest years she was trained for the\r\nballet, and made her appearance at the Karntner-Thor theatre in Vienna\r\nbefore she was seven. She almost invariably danced with her sister\r\nTheresa, who was two years her senior; and, after some years' experience\r\ntogether in Vienna, the two went in 1827 to Naples. Their success\r\nthere--to which Fanny contributed more largely than her sister, who used\r\nto efface herself in order to heighten the effect of Fanny's more\r\nbrilliant powers--led to an engagement in Berlin in 1830. This was the\r\nbeginning of a series of triumphs for Fanny's personal beauty and skill\r\nin dancing. After captivating all hearts in Berlin and Vienna, and\r\ninspiring the aged statesman Friedrich von Gentz (q.v.) with a\r\nremarkable passion, she paid a visit to London, where she received much\r\nkindness at the hands of Mr and Mrs Grote, who practically adopted the\r\nlittle girl who was born three months after the mother's arrival in\r\nEngland. In September 1834 Fanny Elssler appeared at the Opera in Paris,\r\na step to which she looked forward with much misgiving on account of\r\nTaglioni's supremacy on that stage. The result, however, was another\r\ntriumph for her, and the temporary eclipse of Taglioni, who, although\r\nthe finer artist of the two, could not for the moment compete with the\r\nnewcomer's personal fascination. It was conspicuously in her performance\r\nof the Spanish _cachuca_ that Fanny Elssler outshone all rivals. In 1840\r\nshe sailed with her sister for New York, and after two years' unmixed\r\nsuccess they returned to Europe, where during the following five years\r\nFanny appeared in Germany, Austria, France, England and Russia. In 1845,\r\nhaving amassed a fortune, she retired from the stage and settled near\r\nHamburg. A few years later her sister Theresa contracted a morganatic\r\nmarriage with Prince Adalbert of Prussia, and was ennobled under the\r\ntitle of Baroness von Barnim. Fanny Elssler died at Vienna on the 27th\r\nof November 1884. Theresa was left a widow in 1873, and died on the 19th\r\nof November 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELSTER, the name of two rivers of Germany. (1) The Schwarze (Black)\r\nElster rises in the Lausitz range, on the southern border of Saxony,\r\nflows N. and N.W., and after a course of 112 m. enters the Elbe a little\r\nabove Wittenberg. It is a sluggish stream, winding its way through sandy\r\nsoil and frequently along a divided channel. (2) The Weisse (White)\r\nElster rises in the north-western corner of Bohemia, a little north of\r\nEger, cuts through the Vogtland in a deep and picturesque valley,\r\npassing Plauen, Greiz, Gera and Zeitz on its way north to Leipzig, just\r\nbelow which city it receives its most important tributary, the Pleisse.\r\nAt Leipzig it divides, the main stream turning north-west and entering\r\nthe Saale from the right a little above Halle; the other arm, the Luppe,\r\nflowing parallel to the main stream and south of it enters the Saale\r\nbelow Merseburg. Total length, 121 m.; total descent, 1286 ft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELSTER, a spa and inland watering-place of Germany, in the kingdom of\r\nSaxony, on the Weisse Elster, close to the Bohemian frontier on the\r\nrailway Plauen-Eger, and 20 m. S. of the former. It has some industries\r\nof lace-making and weaving, and a population of about 2000, in addition\r\nto visitors. The mineral springs, saline-chalybeate, specific in cases\r\nof nervous disorders and feminine ailments, have been lately\r\nsupplemented by baths of various kinds, and these, together with the\r\nnatural attractions of the place as a climatic health resort, have\r\ncombined to make it a fashionable watering-place during the summer\r\nseason. The number of visitors amounts annually to about 10,000.\r\n\r\n  See Flechsig, _Bad Elster_ (Leipzig, 1884).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELSWICK, a ward of the city of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, in the\r\nwestern part of the borough, bordering the river Tyne. The name is well\r\nknown in connexion with the great ordnance and naval works of Sir W.G.\r\nArmstrong, Mitchell & Co. Elswick Park, attached to the old mansion of\r\nthe same name, is now a public recreation ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL TEB, a halting-place in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan near the coast of\r\nthe Red Sea, 9 m. S.W. of the port of Trinkitat on the road to Tokar. At\r\nEl Teb, on the 4th of February 1884, a heterogeneous force under General\r\nValentine Baker, marching to the relief of the Egyptian garrison of\r\nTokar, was completely routed by the Mahdists (see EGYPT: _Military\r\nOperations_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELTON, CHARLES ISAAC (1839-1900), English lawyer and antiquary, was born\r\nat Southampton on the 6th of December 1839. Educated at Cheltenham and\r\nBalliol College, Oxford, he was elected a fellow of Queen's College in\r\n1862. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1865. His remarkable\r\nknowledge of old real property law and custom helped him to an extensive\r\nconveyancing practice and he took silk in 1885. He sat in the House of\r\nCommons for West Somerset in 1884-1885 and from 1886 to 1892. In 1869 he\r\nsucceeded to his uncle's property of Whitestaunton, near Chard, in\r\nSomerset. During the later years of his life he retired to a great\r\nextent from legal practice, and devoted much of his time to literary\r\nwork. He died at Whitestaunton on the 23rd of April 1900. Elton's\r\nprincipal works were _The Tenures of Kent_ (1867); _Treatise on Commons\r\nand Waste Lands_ (1868); _Law of Copyholds_ (1874); _Origins of English\r\nHistory_ (1882); _Custom and Tenant Right_ (1882).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELTVILLE (ELFELD), a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of\r\nHesse-Nassau, on the right bank of the Rhine, 5 m. S.W. from Wiesbaden,\r\non the railway Frankfort-on-Main-Cologne, and with a branch to\r\nSchlangenbad. Pop. 3700. It has a Roman Catholic and a Protestant\r\nchurch, ruins of a feudal castle, a Latin school, and a monument to\r\nGutenberg. It has a considerable trade in the wines of the district and\r\ntwo manufactories of sparkling wines. Eltville (originally _Adeldvile_,\r\nLat. _Altavilla_) is first mentioned in a record of the year 882. It was\r\ngiven by the emperor Otto I. to the archbishops of Mainz, who often\r\nresided here. It received town rights in 1331 and was a place of\r\nimportance during the middle ages. In 1465 Gutenberg set up his press at\r\nEltville, under the patronage of Archbishop Adolphus of Nassau, shortly\r\nafterwards handing over its use to the brothers Heinrich and Nikolaus\r\nBechtermunz. Several costly early examples of printed books issued by\r\nthis press survive, the earliest being the _Vocabularium\r\nLatino-Teutonicum_, first printed in 1467.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELTZ, a small river of Germany, a left bank tributary of the Mosel. It\r\nrises in the Eifel range, and, after a course of 5 m., joins the latter\r\nriver at Moselkern. Just above its confluence stands the romantic castle\r\nof Eltz, crowning a rocky summit 900 ft. high, and famous as being one\r\nof the best preserved medieval strongholds of Germany. It is the\r\nancestral seat of the counts of Eltz and contains numerous antiquities.\r\n\r\n  See Roth, _Geschichte der Herren und Grafen zu Eltz_ (2 vols., Mainz,\r\n  1889-1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELVAS, an episcopal city and frontier fortress of Portugal, in the\r\ndistrict of Portalegre and formerly included in the province of\r\nAlemtejo; 170 m. E. of Lisbon, and 10 m. W. of the Spanish fortress of\r\nBadajoz, by the Madrid-Badajoz-Lisbon railway. Pop. (1900) 13,981. Elvas\r\nis finely situated on a hill 5 m. N.W. of the river Guadiana. It is\r\ndefended by seven bastions and the two forts of Santa Luzia and Nossa\r\nSenhora da Graca. Its late Gothic cathedral, which has also many traces\r\nof Moorish influence in its architecture, dates from the reign of\r\nEmmanuel I. (1495-1521). A fine aqueduct, 4 m. long, supplies the city\r\nwith pure water; it was begun early in the 15th century and completed in\r\n1622. For some distance it includes four tiers of superimposed arches,\r\nwith a total height of 120 ft. The surrounding lowlands are very\r\nfertile, and Elvas is celebrated for its excellent olives and plums, the\r\nlast-named being exported, either fresh or dried, in large quantities.\r\nBrandy is distilled and pottery manufactured in the city. The fortress\r\nof Campo Maior, 10 m. N.E., is famous for its siege by the French and\r\nrelief by the British under Marshal Beresford in 1811--an exploit\r\ncommemorated in a ballad by Sir Walter Scott.\r\n\r\nElvas is the Roman _Alpesa_ or _Helvas_, the Moorish _Balesh_, the\r\nSpanish _Yelves_. It was wrested from the Moors by Alphonso VIII. of\r\nCastile in 1166; but was temporarily recaptured before its final\r\noccupation by the Portuguese in 1226. In 1570 it became an episcopal\r\nsee. From 1642 until modern times it was the chief frontier fortress S.\r\nof the Tagus; and it twice withstood sieges by the Spanish, in 1658 and\r\n1711. The French under Marshal Junot took it in March 1808, but\r\nevacuated it in August, after the conclusion of the convention of Cintra\r\n(see PENINSULAR WAR).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELVEY, SIR GEORGE JOB (1816-1893), English organist and composer, was\r\nborn at Canterbury on the 27th of March 1816. He was a chorister at\r\nCanterbury cathedral under Highmore Skeats, the organist. Subsequently\r\nhe became a pupil of his elder brother, Stephen, and then studied at the\r\nRoyal Academy of Music under Cipriani Potter and Dr Crotch. In 1834 he\r\ngained the Gresham prize medal for his anthem, \"Bow down thine ear,\" and\r\nin 1835 was appointed organist of St George's chapel, Windsor, a post he\r\nfilled for 47 years, retiring in 1882. He took the degree of Mus. B. at\r\nOxford in 1838, and in 1840 that of Mus. D. Anthems of his were\r\ncommissioned for the Three Choirs Festivals of 1853 and 1857, and in\r\n1871 he received the honour of knighthood. He died at Windlesham in\r\nSurrey on the 9th of December 1893. His works, which are nearly all for\r\nthe Church, include two oratorios, a great number of anthems and\r\nservices, and some pieces for the organ. A memoir of him, by his widow,\r\nwas published in 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELVIRA, SYNOD OF, an ecclesiastical synod held in Spain, the date of\r\nwhich cannot be determined with exactness. The solution of the question\r\nhinges upon the interpretation of the canons, that is, upon whether they\r\nare to be taken as reflecting a recent, or as pointing to an imminent,\r\npersecution. Thus some argue for a date between 300 and 303, i.e. before\r\nthe Diocletian persecution; others for a date between 303 and 314, after\r\nthe persecution, but before the synod of Arles; still others for a date\r\nbetween the synod of Arles and the council of Nicaea, 325. Mansi,\r\nHardouin, Hefele and Dale are in substantial agreement upon 305 or 306,\r\nand this is probably the closest approximation possible in the present\r\nstate of the evidence. The place of meeting, Elvira, was not far from\r\nthe modern Granada, if not, as Dale thinks, actually identical with it.\r\nThere the nineteen bishops and twenty-four presbyters, from all parts of\r\nSpain, but chiefly from the south, assembled, probably at the\r\ninstigation of Hosius of Cordova, but under the presidency of Felix of\r\nAccis, with a view to restoring order and discipline in the church. The\r\neighty-one canons which were adopted reflect with considerable fulness\r\nthe internal life and external relations of the Spanish Church of the\r\n4th century. The social environment of Christians may be inferred from\r\nthe canons prohibiting marriage and other intercourse with Jews, pagans\r\nand heretics, closing the offices of _flamen_ and _duumvir_ to\r\nChristians, forbidding all contact with idolatry and likewise\r\nparticipation in pagan festivals and public games. The state of morals\r\nis mirrored in the canons denouncing prevalent vices. The canons\r\nrespecting the clergy exhibit the clergy as already a special class with\r\npeculiar privileges, a more exacting moral standard, heavier penalties\r\nfor delinquency. The bishop has acquired control of the sacraments,\r\npresbyters and deacons acting only under his orders; the episcopate\r\nappears as a unit, bishops being bound to respect one another's\r\ndisciplinary decrees. Worthy of special note are canon 33, enjoining\r\ncelibacy upon all clerics and all who minister at the altar (the most\r\nancient canon of celibacy); canon 36, forbidding pictures in churches;\r\ncanon 38, permitting lay baptism under certain conditions; and canon 53,\r\nforbidding one bishop to restore a person excommunicated by another.\r\n\r\n  See Mansi ii. pp. 1-406; Hardouin i. pp. 247-258; Hefele (2nd ed.) i.\r\n  pp. 148 sqq.

El Wad is one\r\nof the most interesting places in Algeria. It is surrounded by huge\r\nhollows containing noble palm groves; and beyond these on every side\r\nstretches the limitless desert with its great billows of sand, the\r\nencroachments of which on the oasis are only held at bay by ceaseless\r\ntoil. The town itself consists of a mass of one-storeyed stone houses,\r\neach surmounted by a little dome, clustering round the market-place with\r\nits mosque and minaret. By an exception rare in Saharan settlements,\r\nthere are no defensive works save the fort containing the government\r\noffices, which the French have built on the south side of the town. The\r\ninhabitants are of two distinct tribes, one, the Aduan, of Berber stock,\r\nthe other a branch of the Sha`ambah Arabs. El Wad possesses a curious\r\ncurrency known as _flous_, consisting of obsolete copper coins of\r\nAlgerian and Tunisian dynasties. Seven flous are regarded as equal to\r\nthe French five-centime piece.\r\n\r\nEl Wad oasis is one of a group known collectively as the Suf. Five miles\r\nN.W. is Kuinine (pop. 3541) and 6 m. farther N.W. Guemar (pop. 6885), an\r\nancient fortified town noted for its manufacture of carpets. Linen\r\nweaving is carried on extensively in the Suf. Administratively El Wad is\r\nthe capital of an annexe to the territory of Tuggurt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELWOOD, a city of Madison county, Indiana, U.S.A., on Duck Creek, about\r\n38 m. N.E. of Indianapolis. Pop. (1880) 751; (1890) 2284; (1900) 12,950\r\n(1386 foreign-born); (1910) 11,028. Elwood is served by the Lake Erie &\r\nWestern and the Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Chicago & St Louis railways, and\r\nby an interurban electric line. Its rapid growth in population and as a\r\nmanufacturing centre was due largely to its situation in the natural gas\r\nregion; the failure of the gas supply in 1903 caused a decrease in\r\nmanufacturing, but the city gradually adjusted itself to new conditions.\r\nIt has large tin plate mills, iron and steel foundries, saw and planing\r\nmills, wooden-ware and furniture factories, bottling works and\r\nlamp-chimney factories, flour mills and packing houses. In 1905 the\r\nvalue of the city's factory product was $6,111,083; in 1900 it was\r\n$9,433,513; the glass product was valued at $223,766 in 1905, and at\r\n$1,011,803 in 1900. There are extensive brick-yards in the vicinity, and\r\nthe surrounding agricultural country furnishes large supplies of grain,\r\nlive-stock, poultry and produce, for which Elwood is the shipping\r\ncentre. The site was first settled under the name of Quincy; the present\r\nname was adopted in 1869; and in 1891 Elwood received a city charter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELY, RICHARD THEODORE (1854-   ), American economist, was born at Ripley,\r\nNew York, on the 13th of April 1854. Educated at Columbia and Heidelberg\r\nuniversities, he held the professorship of economics at Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity from 1881 to 1892, and was subsequently professor of\r\neconomics at Wisconsin University. Professor Ely took an active part in\r\nthe formation of the American Economic Association, was secretary from\r\n1885 to 1892 and president from 1899 to 1901. He published a useful\r\n_Introduction to Political Economy_ (1889); _Outlines of Economics_\r\n(1893); _The Labour Movement in America_ (1883); _Problems of To-day_\r\n(1888); _Social Aspects of Christianity_ (1889); _Socialism and Social\r\nReform_ (1894); _Monopolies and Trusts_ (1900), and _Studies in the\r\nEvolution of Industrial Society_ (1903).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELY, a cathedral city and market-town, in the Newmarket parliamentary\r\ndivision of Cambridgeshire, England, 16 m. N.N.E. of Cambridge by the\r\nGreat Eastern railway. Pop. of urban district (1901) 7713. It stands on\r\na considerable eminence on the west (left) bank of the Ouse, in the Isle\r\nof Ely, which rises above the surrounding fens. Thus its situation,\r\nbefore the great drainage operations of the 17th century, was\r\npractically insular. The magnificent cathedral, towering above the town,\r\nis a landmark far over the wide surrounding level. The soil in the\r\nvicinity is fertile and market-gardening is carried on, fruit and\r\nvegetables (especially asparagus) being sent to the London markets. The\r\ntown has a considerable manufacture of tobacco pipes and earthenware,\r\nand there are in the neighbourhood mills for the preparation of oil from\r\nflax, hemp and cole-seed. Besides the cathedral Ely has in St Mary's\r\nchurch, lying almost under the shadow of the greater building, a fine\r\nstructure ranging in style from Norman to Perpendicular, but in the main\r\nEarly English. The sessions house and corn exchange are the principal\r\npublic buildings. The grammar school, founded by Henry VIII. in 1541,\r\noccupies (together with other buildings) the room over the gateway of\r\nthe monastery, known as the Porta, and the chapel built by Prior John de\r\nCranden (1321-1341) is restored to use as a school chapel. A theological\r\ncollege was founded in 1876 and opened in 1881.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the present cathedral was laid by its first Norman\r\nabbot, Simeon, in 1083. But the reputation of Ely had been established\r\nlong before Etheldreda (Aethelthryth), daughter of Anna, king of East\r\nAnglia, was married to Ecgfrith, king of Northumbria, against her will,\r\nas she had vowed herself wholly to a religious life. Her husband opposed\r\nhimself to her vow, but with the help of Wilfrid, archbishop of York,\r\nshe took the veil, and found refuge from her husband in the marsh-girt\r\nIsle of Ely. Here she founded a religious house, in all probability a\r\nmixed community, in 673, becoming its first abbess, and giving the whole\r\nIsle of Ely to the foundation. In 870 the monastery was destroyed by the\r\nDanes, as were also the neighbouring foundations at Soham, Thorney,\r\nCrowland and Peterborough, and it remained in ruins till 970, when\r\nAethelwold, bishop of Winchester, founded a new Benedictine monastery\r\nhere. King Edgar in 970 endowed the monks with the former possessions of\r\nthe convent and also granted them the secular causes of two hundreds\r\nwithin and of five hundreds without the marshes, all charges belonging\r\nto the king in secular disputes in all their lands and every fourth\r\npenny of public revenue in the province of Grantecestre. The wealth and\r\nimportance of Ely rose, and its abbots held the post of chancellors of\r\nthe king's court alternately with the abbots of Glastonbury and of St\r\nAugustine's, Canterbury. But Ely again became a scene of contest in the\r\ndesperate final struggle against William the Conqueror of which Hereward\r\n\"the Wake\" was the hero. Finally, in 1071, the monks agreed to surrender\r\nthe Isle of Ely to the king on condition of the confirmation of all the\r\npossessions and privileges, held by them in the time of Edward the\r\nConfessor. Abbot Simeon (1081-1094), who now began the reconstruction of\r\nthe church, was related to William and brother to Walkelin, first Norman\r\nbishop of Winchester. Under Abbot Richard (1100-1107) the translation\r\nfrom the Saxon church of the bodies of St Etheldreda and of the two\r\nabbesses who had followed her, and their enshrinement in the new\r\nedifice, took place; and it was due to the honour in which the memory of\r\nthe foundresses was held that Ely maintained the position of dignity\r\nwhich it kept henceforth until the dissolution of the monasteries. The\r\nfeast of St Etheldreda, or St Awdrey as she was generally called, was\r\nthe occasion every year for a large fair here, at which \"trifling\r\nobjects\" were sold to pilgrims by way of souvenirs; whence the word\r\n\"tawdrey,\" a contraction of St Awdrey. In 1109 the Isle of Ely, most of\r\nCambridgeshire, and the abbeys of Thorney and Cetricht were separated\r\nfrom the diocese of Lincoln, and converted into a new diocese, Ely being\r\nthe seat of the bishopric, and after the dissolution of the monasteries\r\nHenry VIII. converted the conventual church into a cathedral (1541). The\r\ndiocese is extensive. It covers nearly the whole of Cambridgeshire,\r\nHuntingdonshire and Bedfordshire, part of Suffolk, and small portions of\r\nEssex, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral is a cruciform structure, 537 ft. long and 190 ft. across\r\nthe great transepts (exterior measurements). A relic of the Saxon\r\nfoundation is preserved in the cross of St Osyth (c. 670), and a\r\npre-Norman window is kept in the triforium, having been dug up near the\r\ncathedral. Of the work of the first two Norman abbots all that remains\r\nis the early Norman lower storey of the main transept. The foundations\r\nof Abbot Simeon's apse were discovered below the present choir. The\r\nnave, which is Norman throughout, is 208 ft. in length, 72 ft. 9 in. to\r\nthe top of the walls, and 77 ft. 3 in. broad, including the aisles. The\r\nupper parts of the western tower and the transept were begun by Bishop\r\nGeoffrey Ridel (d. 1189), and continued by his successor William\r\nLongchamp, chancellor of England. The tower, which is 215 ft. high, is\r\nsurmounted by a Decorated octagon with partly detached side turrets, and\r\nunderwent alteration and strengthening in the Perpendicular period. The\r\nnorth-western transept wing is in ruins; it is not known when it fell.\r\nThe Galilee, or western porch, by which the cathedral is entered, is the\r\nwork of Bishop Eustace (d. 1215), and is a perfect example of Early\r\nEnglish style. In 1322 the Norman central tower, erected by Abbot\r\nSimeon, fell. Alan of Walsingham, sacrist of the church, designed its\r\nrestoration in the form of the present octagon, a beautiful and unique\r\nconception. Instead of the ordinary four-arched central crossing, an\r\noctagon is formed at the crossing, the arches of the nave aisles and\r\nchoir aisles being set obliquely. Both without and within, the octagon\r\nis the principal feature in the unusual general appearance of the\r\ncathedral, which gives it a peculiar eminence among English churches.\r\nThe octagon was completed in 1328, and upon the ribbed vaulting of wood\r\nabove it rose the lofty lantern, octagonal also, with its angles set\r\nopposite those of the octagon below. The total height of the structure\r\nis 170 ft. 7 in. Alan of Walsingham was further employed by Bishop John\r\nof Hotham (d. 1337) as architect of the Lady chapel, a beautiful example\r\nof Decorated work, which served from 1566 onward as a parish church. Of\r\nthe seven bays of the choir the four easternmost, as well as the two\r\nbeyond forming the retrochoir, were built by Bishop Hugh of Northwold\r\n(d. 1254). The three western bays were destroyed by the fall of the\r\ntower in 1321, and were rebuilt by Alan of Walsingham. The earlier\r\nportion is a superb example of Early English work, while the later is\r\nperhaps the best example of pure Decorated in England. The wooden\r\ncanopies of the choir stalls are Decorated (1337) and very elaborate.\r\nThe Perpendicular style is represented by windows and certain other\r\ndetails, including supporting arches to the western tower. There are\r\nalso some splendid chantry chapels and tombs in this style--the chapels\r\nof Bishop John Alcock (d. 1500) and Bishop Nicolas West (d. 1534), in\r\nthe north and south choir aisles respectively, are completely covered\r\nwith the most delicate ornamentation; while the tomb of Bishop Richard\r\nRedman (d. 1505) has a remarkably beautiful canopy. Among earlier\r\nmonuments the canopied tomb of Bishop William de Luda (1290-1298) and\r\nthe finely-carved effigy of Bishop Northwold (1254) are notable. Between\r\n1845 and 1884 the cathedral underwent restoration under the direction of\r\nSir Gilbert Scott. The work included the erection of the modern reredos\r\nand choir-screen, both designed by Scott, and the painting of the nave\r\nroof by Styleman le Strange (d. 1862), who was succeeded by Gambier\r\nParry. Parry also richly ornamented the octagon and lantern in the style\r\nof the 14th century.\r\n\r\nRemains of the monastic buildings are fragmentary but numerous. Mention\r\nhas been made of the Ely \"Porta\" or gateway (1396), which is occupied by\r\nthe grammar school, and of Prior John de Cranden's beautiful little\r\nDecorated chapel. But many of the remains, the bulk of which are\r\nincorporated in the deanery and canons' and other residences to the\r\nsouth of the cathedral, are of much earlier date. Thus the fine early\r\nNorman undercroft of the prior's hall is probably of the time of Abbot\r\nSimeon. Another notable fragment is the transitional Norman chancel of\r\nthe infirmary chapel. The remnants of the cloisters show a\r\nreconstruction in the 15th century, but the prior's and monks' doorways\r\nfrom the cloisters into the cathedral are highly decorated late Norman.\r\nThe bishop's palace to the west of the cathedral has towers erected by\r\nBishop Alcock at the close of the 15th century. In the muniment room of\r\nthe chapter is preserved, among many ancient documents of great\r\ninterest, the _liber Eliensis_, a history of the monastery by the monk\r\nknown as Thomas of Ely (d. c. 1174), of which the first part, which\r\nextends to the year 960, contains a life of St Etheldreda, while the\r\nsecond is continued to the year 1107.\r\n\r\nEly, which according to Bede (_Hist. eccl._ iv. 19) derives its name\r\nfrom the quantity of eels in the waters about it (A.S. _ael_, eel, _-ig_,\r\nisland), was a borough by prescription at least as early as the reign of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror. It owed its importance entirely to the monastery,\r\nand for a long time the abbot and afterwards the bishop had almost\r\nabsolute power in the town. The bailiff who governed the town was chosen\r\nby the bishop until 1850, when a local board was appointed. Richard I.\r\ngranted the bishop of Ely a fair there, and in 1319-1320 John of\r\nHotham, a later bishop, received licence to hold a fair on the vigil and\r\nday of Ascension and for twenty days following. The markets are claimed\r\nby an undated charter by the bishop, who also continues to hold the\r\nfairs. In 1295 Ely sent two members to parliament, but has never been\r\nrepresented since.\r\n\r\n  See C.W. Stubbs, _Ely Cathedral_ (London, 1897); _Victoria County\r\n  History, Cambridgeshire._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELYOT, SIR THOMAS (c. 1490-1546), English diplomatist and scholar. His\r\nfather, Sir Richard Elyot (d. 1522), who held considerable estates in\r\nWiltshire, was made (1503) serjeant-at-law and attorney-general to the\r\nqueen consort, and soon afterwards was commissioned to act as justice of\r\nassize on the western circuit, becoming in 1513 judge of common pleas.\r\nThomas was the son of his first marriage with Alice Fynderne, but\r\nneither the date nor place of his birth is accurately known. Anthony a\r\nWood claimed him as an _alumnus_ of St Mary Hall, Oxford, while C.H.\r\nCooper in the _Athenae Cantabrigienses_ put in a claim for Jesus\r\nCollege, Cambridge. Elyot himself says in the preface to his\r\n_Dictionary_ that he was educated under the paternal roof, and was from\r\nthe age of twelve his own tutor. He supplies, in the introduction to his\r\n_Castell of Helth_, a list of the authors he had read in philosophy and\r\nmedicine, adding that a \"worshipful physician\" read to him Galen and\r\nsome other authors. In 1511 he accompanied his father on the western\r\ncircuit as clerk to the assize, and he held this position until 1528. In\r\naddition to his father's lands in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire he inherited\r\nin 1523 the Cambridge estates of his cousin, Thomas Fynderne. His title\r\nwas disputed, but Wolsey decided in his favour, and also made him clerk\r\nof the privy council. Elyot, in a letter addressed to Thomas Cromwell,\r\nsays that he never received the emoluments of this office, while the\r\nbarren honour of knighthood conferred on him when he was displaced in\r\n1530 merely put him to further expense. In that year he sat on the\r\ncommission appointed to inquire into the Cambridgeshire estates of his\r\nformer patron, Cardinal Wolsey. He married Margaret Barrow, who is\r\ndescribed (Stapleton, _Vita Thomae Mori_, p. 59, ed. 1558) as a student\r\nin the \"school\" of Sir Thomas More.\r\n\r\nIn 1531 he produced the _Boke named the Governour_, dedicated to King\r\nHenry VIII. The work advanced him in the king's favour, and in the close\r\nof the year he received instructions to proceed to the court of the\r\nemperor Charles V. to induce him to take a more favourable view of\r\nHenry's projected divorce from Catherine of Aragon. With this was\r\ncombined another commission, on which one of the king's agents, Stephen\r\nVaughan, was already engaged. He was, if possible, to apprehend William\r\nTyndale. It is probable that Elyot was suspected, as Vaughan certainly\r\nwas, of lukewarmness in carrying out the king's wishes, but this has not\r\nprevented his being much abused by Protestant writers. As ambassador\r\nElyot had been involved in ruinous expense, and on his return he wrote\r\nto Thomas Cromwell, begging to be excused from serving as sheriff of\r\nCambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, on the score of his poverty. The\r\nrequest was not granted. He was one of the commissioners in the inquiry\r\ninstituted by Cromwell prior to the suppression of the monasteries, but\r\nhe did not obtain any share of the spoils. There is little doubt that\r\nhis known friendship for Thomas More militated against his chances of\r\nsuccess, for in a letter addressed to Cromwell he admitted his\r\nfriendship for More, but protested that he rated higher his duty to the\r\nking. William Roper, in his _Life_ of More, says that Elyot was on a\r\nsecond embassy to Charles V., in the winter of 1535-1536, when he\r\nreceived at Naples the news of More's execution. He had been kept in the\r\ndark by his own government, but heard the news from the emperor. The\r\nstory of an earlier embassy to Rome (1532), mentioned by Burnet, rests\r\non a late endorsement of instructions dated from that year, which cannot\r\nbe regarded as authoritative. In 1542 he represented the borough of\r\nCambridge in parliament. He had purchased from Cromwell the manor of\r\nCarleton in Cambridgeshire, where he died on the 26th of March 1546.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Elyot received little reward for his services to the state,\r\nbut his scholarship and his books were held in high esteem by his\r\ncontemporaries. The _Boke named the Governour_ was printed by Thomas\r\nBerthelet (1531, 1534, 1536, 1544, &c.). It is a treatise on moral\r\nphilosophy, intended to direct the education of those destined to fill\r\nhigh positions, and to inculcate those moral principles which alone\r\ncould fit them for the performance of their duties. The subject was a\r\nfavourite one in the 16th century, and the book, which contained many\r\ncitations from classical authors, was very popular. Elyot expressly\r\nacknowledges his obligations to Erasmus's _Institutio Principis\r\nChristiani_; but he makes no reference to the _De regno et regis\r\ninstitutione_ of Francesco Patrizzi (d. 1494), bishop of Gaeta, on which\r\nhis work was undoubtedly modelled. As a prose writer, Elyot enriched the\r\nEnglish language with many new words. In 1534 he published _The Castell\r\nof Helth_, a popular treatise on medicine, intended to place a\r\nscientific knowledge of the art within the reach of those unacquainted\r\nwith Greek. This work, though scoffed at by the faculty, was appreciated\r\nby the general public, and speedily went through many editions. His\r\nLatin _Dictionary_, the earliest comprehensive dictionary of the\r\nlanguage, was completed in 1538. The copy of the first edition in the\r\nBritish Museum contains an autograph letter from Elyot to Thomas\r\nCromwell, to whom it originally belonged. It was edited and enlarged in\r\n1548 by Thomas Cooper, bishop of Winchester, who called it _Bibliotheca\r\nEliotae_, and it formed the basis in 1565 of Cooper's _Thesaurus linguae\r\nRomanae et Britannicae_.\r\n\r\n  Elyot's translations include:--_The Doctrinal of Princes_ (1534), from\r\n  Isocrates; _Cyprianus, A Swete and Devoute Sermon of Holy Saynt\r\n  Ciprian of the Mortalitie of Man_ (1534); _Rules of a Christian Life_\r\n  (1534), from Pico della Mirandola; _The Education or Bringing up of\r\n  Children_ (c. 1535), from Plutarch; and _Howe one may take Profite\r\n  of his Enymes_ (1535), from the same author is generally attributed to\r\n  him. He also wrote: _The Knowledge which maketh a Wise Man_ and\r\n  _Pasquyll the Playne_ (1533); _The Bankette of Sapience_ (1534), a\r\n  collection of moral sayings; _Preservative agaynste Deth_ (1545),\r\n  which contains many quotations from the Fathers; _Defence of Good\r\n  Women_ (1545). His _Image of Governance, compiled of the Actes and\r\n  Sentences notable of the most noble Emperor Alexander Severus_ (1540)\r\n  professed to be a translation from a Greek MS. of the emperor's\r\n  secretary Encolpius (or Eucolpius, as Elyot calls him), which had been\r\n  lent him by a gentleman of Naples, called Pudericus, who asked to have\r\n  it back before the translation was complete. In these circumstances\r\n  Elyot, as he asserts in his preface, supplied the other maxims from\r\n  different sources. He was violently assailed by Humphrey Hody and\r\n  later by William Wotton for putting forward a pseudo-translation; but\r\n  Mr H.H.S. Croft has discovered that there was a Neapolitan gentleman\r\n  at that time bearing the name of Poderico, or, Latinized, Pudericus,\r\n  with whom Elyot may well have been acquainted. Roger Ascham mentions\r\n  his _De rebus memorabilibus Angliae_; and Webbe quotes a few lines of\r\n  a lost translation of the _Ars poetica_ of Horace.\r\n\r\n  A learned edition of the _Governour_ (2 vols., 1880), by H.H.S. Croft,\r\n  contains, besides copious notes, a valuable glossary of 16th century\r\n  English words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELYRIA, a city and the county-seat of Lorain county, Ohio, U.S.A., on\r\nthe Black river, 8 m. from Lake Erie, and about 25 m. W.S.W. of\r\nCleveland. Pop. (1890) 5611; (1900) 8791, of whom 1397 were\r\nforeign-born; (1910 census) 14,825. It is served by the Baltimore &\r\nOhio, and the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern railways. Elyria is about\r\n720 ft. above sea-level, and lies at the junction of the two forks of\r\nthe Black river, each of which falls about 50 ft. here, furnishing\r\nwater-power. Among the city's manufactures are oxide of tin and other\r\nchemicals, iron and steel, leather goods, automobiles and bicycles,\r\nelectrical and telephone supplies, butted tubing, gas engines, screws\r\nand bolts, silk, lace and hosiery. In 1905 the city's factory products\r\nwere valued at $2,933,450--140.2% more than their value in 1900.\r\nFlagging, building-stones and grindstones, taken from quarries in the\r\nvicinity (known as the Berea Grit quarries), are shipped from Elyria in\r\nlarge quantities. Elyria was founded about 1819 by Heman Ely, in whose\r\nhonour it was named; it was selected as the site for the county seat in\r\n1823, and was chartered as a city in 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELYSIUM, in Greek mythology, the Elysian fields, the abode of the\r\nrighteous after their removal from earth. In Homer (_Od._ iv. 563) this\r\nregion is a plain at the farthest end of the earth on the banks of the\r\nriver Oceanus, where the fair-haired Rhadamanthys rules, and where the\r\npeople are vexed by neither snow nor storm, heat nor cold, the air being\r\nalways tempered by the zephyr wafted from the ocean. It is no dwelling\r\nof the dead nor part of the lower world, but distinguished heroes are\r\ntranslated thither without dying, to live a life of perfect happiness.\r\nIn Hesiod (_W. and D._ 166) the same description is given of the Islands\r\nof the Blessed under the rule of Cronus, which yield three harvests\r\nyearly. Here, according to Pindar, Rhadamanthys sits by the side of his\r\nfather Cronus and administers judgment (_Ol._ ii. 61, _Frag. 95_). All\r\nwho have successfully gone through a triple probation on earth are\r\nadmitted to share these blessings. In later accounts (_Aeneid_, vi. 541)\r\nElysium was regarded as part of the underworld, the home of the\r\nrighteous dead adjudged worthy of it by the tribunal of Minos,\r\nRhadamanthys and Aeacus. Those who had lived evil lives were thrust down\r\ninto Tartarus, where they suffered endless torments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELZE, KARL (1821-1889), German scholar and Shakespearian critic, was\r\nborn at Dessau on the 22nd of May 1821. Having studied (1839-1843)\r\nclassical philology, and modern, but especially English, literature at\r\nthe university of Leipzig, he was a master for a time in the Gymnasium\r\n(classical school) at Dessau, and in 1875 was appointed extraordinary,\r\nand in 1876 ordinary, professor of English philology at the university\r\nof Halle, in which city he died on the 21st of January 1889. Elze began\r\nhis literary career with the _Englischer Liederschatz_ (1851), an\r\nanthology of English lyrics, edited for a while a critical periodical\r\n_Atlantis_, and in 1857 published an edition of Shakespeare's _Hamlet_\r\nwith critical notes. He also edited Chapman's _Alphonsus_ (1867) and\r\nwrote biographies of Walter Scott, Byron and Shakespeare; _Abhandlungen\r\nzu Shakespeare_ (English translation by D. Schmitz, as _Essays on\r\nShakespeare_, London, 1874), and the excellent treatise, _Notes on\r\nElizabethan Dramatists with conjectural emendations of the text_ (3\r\nvols., Halle, 1880-1886, new ed. 1889).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELZEVIR, the name of a celebrated family of Dutch printers belonging to\r\nthe 17th century. The original name of the family was Elsevier, or\r\nElzevier, and their French editions mostly retain this name; but in\r\ntheir Latin editions, which are the more numerous, the name is spelt\r\nElzeverius, which was gradually corrupted in English into Elzevir as a\r\ngeneric term for their books. The family originally came from Louvain,\r\nand there Louis, who first made the name Elzevir famous, was born in\r\n1540. He learned the business of a bookbinder, and having been compelled\r\nin 1580, on account of his Protestantism and his adherence to the cause\r\nof the insurgent provinces, to leave his native country, he established\r\nhimself as bookbinder and bookseller in Leiden. His _Eutropius_, which\r\nappeared in 1592, was long regarded as the earliest Elzevir, but the\r\nfirst is now known to be _Drusii Ebraicarum quaestionum ac responsionum\r\nlibri duo_, which was produced in 1583. In all he published about 150\r\nworks. He died on the 4th of February 1617. Of his five sons, Matthieu,\r\nLouis, Gilles, Joost and Bonaventure, who all adopted their father's\r\nprofession, Bonaventure, who was born in 1583, is the most celebrated.\r\nHe began business as a printer in 1608, and in 1626 took into\r\npartnership Abraham, a son of Matthieu, born at Leiden in 1592. Abraham\r\ndied on the 14th of August 1652, and Bonaventure about a month\r\nafterwards. The fame of the Elzevir editions rests chiefly on the works\r\nissued by this firm. Their Greek and Hebrew impressions are considered\r\ninferior to those of the Aldi and the Estiennes, but their small\r\neditions in 12mo, 16mo and 24mo, for elegance of design, neatness,\r\nclearness and regularity of type, and beauty of paper, cannot be\r\nsurpassed. Especially may be mentioned the two editions of the New\r\nTestament in Greek ([Greek: He kaine diatheke], _Novum Testamentum_,\r\n&c.), published in 1624 and 1633, of which the latter is the more\r\nbeautiful and the more sought after; the _Psalterium Davidis_, 1653;\r\n_Virgilii opera_, 1636; _Terentii comediae_, 1635; but the works which\r\ngave their press its chief celebrity are their collection of French\r\nauthors on history and politics in 24mo, known under the name of the\r\n_Petites Republiques_, and their series of Latin, French and Italian\r\nclassics in small 12mo. Jean, son of Abraham, born in 1622, had since\r\n1647 been in partnership with his father and uncle, and when they died\r\nDaniel, son of Bonaventure, born in 1626, joined him. Their partnership\r\ndid not last more than two years, and after its dissolution Jean carried\r\non the business alone till his death in 1661. In 1654 Daniel joined his\r\ncousin Louis (the third of that name and son of the second Louis), who\r\nwas born in 1604, and had established a printing press at Amsterdam in\r\n1638. From 1655 to 1666 they published a series of Latin classics in\r\n8vo, _cum notis variorum_; _Cicero_ in 4to; the _Etymologicon linguae\r\nLatinae_; and a magnificent _Corpus juris civilis_ in folio, 2 vols.,\r\n1663. Louis died in 1670, and Daniel in 1680. Besides Bonaventure,\r\nanother son of Matthieu, Isaac, born in 1593, established a printing\r\npress at Leiden, where he carried on business from 1616 to 1625; but\r\nnone of his editions attained much fame. The last representatives of the\r\nElzevir printers were Peter, grandson of Joost, who from 1667 to 1675\r\nwas a bookseller at Utrecht, and printed seven or eight volumes of\r\nlittle consequence; and Abraham, son of the first Abraham, who from 1681\r\nto 1712 was university printer at Leiden.\r\n\r\nSome of the Elzevir editions bear no other typographical mark than\r\nsimply the words _Apud Elzeverios_, or _Ex officina Elseveriana_, under\r\nthe _rubrique_ of the town. But the majority bear one of their special\r\ndevices, four of which are recognized as in common use. Louis Elzevir,\r\nthe founder of the family, usually adopted the arms of the United\r\nProvinces, an eagle on a cippus holding in its claws a sheaf of seven\r\narrows, with the motto _Concordia res parvae crescunt_. About 1620 the\r\nLeiden Elzevirs adopted a new device, known as \"the solitary,\" and\r\nconsisting of an elm tree, a fruitful vine and a man alone, with a motto\r\n_Non solus_. They also used another device, a palm tree with the motto,\r\n_Assurgo pressa_. The Elzevirs of Amsterdam used for their principal\r\ndevice a figure of Minerva with owl, shield and olive tree, and the\r\nmotto, _Ne extra oleas_. The earliest productions of the Elzevir press\r\nare marked with an angel bearing a book and a scythe, and various other\r\ndevices occur at different times. When the Elzevirs did not wish to put\r\ntheir name to their works they generally marked them with a sphere, but\r\nof course the mere fact that a work printed in the 17th century bears\r\nthis mark is no proof that it is theirs. The total number of works of\r\nall kinds which came from the presses of the Elzevirs is given by\r\nWillems as 1608; there were also many forgeries.\r\n\r\n  See \"Notice de la collection d'auteurs latins, francais, et italiens,\r\n  imprimee de format petit en 12, par les Elsevier,\" in Brunet's _Manuel\r\n  du libraire_ (Paris, 1820); A. de Reume, _Recherches historiques,\r\n  genealogiques, et bibliographiques sur les Elsevier_ (Brussels, 1847);\r\n  Paul Dupont, _Histoire de l'imprimerie_, in two vols.

This theory has been propounded\r\nin many forms, but the central idea is that the universe of individuals\r\nconsists of the involuntary \"outpourings\" of the ultimate divine\r\nessence. That essence is not only all-inclusive, but absolutely perfect,\r\nwhile the \"emanated\" individuals degenerate in proportion to the degree\r\nof their distance from the essence. The existence of evil in opposition\r\nto the perfect goodness of God, as thus explained, need not be\r\nattributed to God's agency, inasmuch as the whole emanation-process is\r\ngoverned by necessary--as it were mechanical--laws, which may be\r\ncompared to those of the physical universe. The doctrine of emanation is\r\nthus to be distinguished from the cosmogonic theory of Judaism and\r\nChristianity, which explains human existence as due to a single creative\r\nact of a moral agent. The God of Judaism and Christianity is\r\nessentially a _person_ in close _personal_ relation to his creatures;\r\nemanation is the denial of personality both for God and for man. The\r\nemanation theory is to be contrasted, on the other hand, with the theory\r\nof evolution. The two theories are alike in so far as both recognize the\r\nexistence of individuals as due to a necessary process of\r\ndifferentiation and a scale of existence. They differ, however,\r\nfundamentally in this respect, that, whereas evolution regards the\r\nprocess as from the indeterminate lower towards the determinate higher,\r\nemanation regards it as from the highest to the indefinitely lower.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable superficial similarity between evolution and\r\nemanation, especially in their formal statements. The process of\r\nevolution from the indeterminate to the determinate is often expressed\r\nas a progress from the universal to the particular. Thus the primordial\r\nmatter assumed by the early Greek physicists may be said to be the\r\nuniversal substance out of which particular things arise. The doctrine\r\nof emanation also regards the world as a process of particularization.\r\nYet the resemblance is more apparent than real. The universal is, as\r\nHerbert Spencer remarked, a subjective idea, and the general forms,\r\nexisting _ante res_, which play so prominent a part in Greek and\r\nmedieval philosophy, do not in the least correspond to the homogeneous\r\nmatter of the physical evolutionists. The one process is a logical\r\noperation, the other a physical. The theory of emanation, which had its\r\nsource in certain moral and religious ideas, aims first of all at\r\nexplaining the origin of mental or spiritual existence as an effluence\r\nfrom the divine and absolute spirit. In the next place, it seeks to\r\naccount for the general laws of the world, for the universal forms of\r\nexistence, as ideas which emanate from the Deity. By some it was\r\ndeveloped into a complete philosophy of the world, in which matter\r\nitself is viewed as the lowest emanation from the absolute. In this form\r\nit stands in sharp antithesis to the doctrine of evolution, both because\r\nthe former views the world of particular things and events as\r\nessentially unreal and illusory, and because the latter, so far as it\r\ngoes, looks on matter as eternal, and seeks to explain the general forms\r\nof things as we perceive them by help of simpler assumptions. In certain\r\ntheories known as doctrines of emanation, only mental existence is\r\nreferred to the absolute source, while matter is viewed as eternal and\r\ndistinct from the divine nature. In this form the doctrine of emanation\r\napproaches certain forms of the evolution theory (see EVOLUTION).\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of emanation is correctly described as of oriental origin.\r\nIt appears in various forms in Indian philosophy, and is the\r\ncharacteristically oriental element in syncretic systems like\r\nNeoplatonism and Gnosticism. None the less it is easy to find it in\r\nembryo in the speculations of the essentially European philosophers of\r\nGreece. Plato, whose philosophy was strongly opposed to the evolution\r\ntheory, distinctly inclines to the emanation idea in his doctrine that\r\neach particular thing is what it is in virtue of a pre-existent idea,\r\nand that the particulars are the lowest in the scale of existence, at\r\nthe head of, or above, which is the idea of the good. The view of\r\nXenocrates is based on the same ideas. Or again, we may compare the\r\nStoic doctrine of [Greek: aporroiai] (literally \"emanations\") from the\r\ndivine essence. It is, however, only in the last eclectic period of\r\nGreek philosophy that the emanation doctrine was definitely established\r\nin the doctrines, e.g. Plotinus.\r\n\r\n  See especially articles EVOLUTION, NEOPLATONISM, GNOSTICISM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMANUEL I. [Portuguese _Manoel_] (1469-1521), fourteenth king of\r\nPortugal, surnamed the Happy, knight of the Garter and of the Golden\r\nFleece, was the son of Duke Ferdinand of Vizeu and of Beatrice of Beja,\r\ngrandchildren of John I. of Portugal. He was born at Alcochete on the\r\n3rd of May 1469, or, according to Barbosa Machado, on the 1st of June.\r\nHis early education was directed by a Sicilian named Cataldo. In 1495 he\r\nbecame king in succession to his cousin John II. In 1497 he married\r\nIsabella, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Castile, who had\r\npreviously been married to Alphonso, the heir of John II. She died in\r\nthe next year in giving birth to a son named Miguel, who until his death\r\ntwo years later was considered heir to the entire Iberian Peninsula.\r\nEmanuel's next wife was Maria, another daughter of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, whom he married in 1500. Two of their children, John and\r\nHenry, later became kings of Portugal. Maria died in 1516, and in 1518\r\nher niece Leonora, a sister of the emperor Charles V., became Emanuel's\r\nthird wife. Emanuel's reign is noteworthy for the continuance of the\r\nPortuguese discoveries and the extension of their chain of\r\ntrading-posts, Vasco da Gama's opening an all-sea route to India,\r\nCabral's landing in Brazil, Corte-Real's voyage to Labrador, the\r\nexploration of the Indian seas and the opening of commercial relations\r\nwith Persia and China, bringing Portugal international prominence,\r\ncolonial pre-eminence and a hitherto unparalleled degree of national\r\nprosperity. His intense religious zeal variously manifested itself in\r\nhis persecutions of the Jews, whom at the beginning of his reign he had\r\nbeen disposed to tolerate, his strenuous endeavours to promote an\r\ninternational crusade against the Turks, his eager missionary enterprise\r\nthroughout his new possessions, and his erection of twenty-six\r\nmonasteries and two cathedrals, including the stately monastic church of\r\nthe Jeronymos at Belem (see LISBON). His jealously despotic character\r\nwas accentuated by the enormous increase the Indies furnished to his\r\npersonal wealth, and exemplified in his assumption of new titles and in\r\na magnificent embassy to Pope Leo X. He died at Lisbon on the 13th of\r\nDecember 1521.\r\n\r\n  The best authorities for the history of Emanuel's reign are the\r\n  contemporary 16th-century _Chronica d'el Rei D. Manoel_, by Damiao de\r\n  Goes, and _De rebus Emanuelis_, by J. Osorio. _El Rei D. Manoel_, by\r\n  M.B. Branco (Lisbon, 1888), is a valuable but ill-arranged biography.\r\n  See also the _Ordenacoes do S.R.D. Manoel_ (Coimbra University Press,\r\n  1797). For further bibliography see Barbosa Machado, _Bibliographica\r\n  Lusitana_, vol. iii. pp. 161-166.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBALMING (Gr. [Greek: balsamon], balsam; Ger. _Einbalsamiren_; Fr.\r\n_embaumement_), the art of preparing dead bodies, chiefly by the use of\r\nmedicaments, in order to preserve them from putrefaction and the attacks\r\nof insects. The ancient Egyptians carried the art to great perfection,\r\nand embalmed not only human beings, but cats, crocodiles, ichneumons,\r\nand other sacred animals. It was at one time suggested that the origin\r\nof embalming in Egypt was to be traced to a want of fuel for the purpose\r\nof cremation, to the inadvisability or at some times impossibility of\r\nburial in a soil annually disturbed by the inundation of the Nile, and\r\nto the necessity, for sanitary reasons, of preventing the decomposition\r\nof the bodies of the dead when placed in open sepulchres. As, however,\r\nthe corpses of the embalmed must have constituted but a small proportion\r\nof the aggregate mass of animal matter daily to be disposed of, the\r\nabove explanation would in any case be far from satisfactory; and there\r\nis no doubt (see MUMMY) that embalming originated in the idea of\r\npreserving the body for a future life. According to W.H. Prescott, it\r\nwas a belief in a resurrection of the body that led the ancient\r\nPeruvians to preserve the air-dried corpses of their dead with so much\r\nsolicitude (see _Conquest of Peru_, bk. i. chap. iii.). And J.C.\r\nPrichard (_Egyptian Mythology_, p. 200) properly compared the Egyptian\r\npractice with the views which rendered \"the Greeks and Romans so anxious\r\nto perform the usual rites of sepulture to their departed warriors,\r\nnamely, ... that these solemnities expedited the journey of the soul to\r\nthe appointed region, where it was to receive judgment for its former\r\ndeeds, and to have its future doom fixed accordingly.\" It has been\r\nsupposed by some that the discovery of the preservation of bodies\r\ninterred in saline soils may have been the immediate origin of embalming\r\nin Egypt. In that country certain classes of the community were\r\nspecially appointed for the practice of the art. Joseph, we are told in\r\nGen. l. 2, \"commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father.\"\r\n\r\nHerodotus (ii. 86) gives an account of three of the methods of embalming\r\nfollowed by the Egyptians. The most expensive of these, which cost a\r\ntalent of silver (L243: 15s.), was as follows. The brains were in part\r\nremoved through the nostrils by means of a bent iron implement, and in\r\npart by the injection of drugs. The intestines having been drawn out\r\nthrough an incision in the left side, the abdomen was cleansed with\r\npalm-wine, and filled with myrrh, cassia and other materials, and the\r\nopening was sewed up. This done, the body was steeped seventy days in a\r\nsolution of litron or natron.[1] Diodorus (i. 91) relates that the\r\ncutter ([Greek: paraschistes]) appointed to make the incision in the\r\nflank for the removal of the intestines, as soon as he had performed his\r\noffice, was pursued with stones and curses by those about him, it being\r\nheld by the Egyptians a detestable thing to commit any violence or\r\ninflict a wound on the body. After the steeping, the body was washed,\r\nand handed over to the swathers, a peculiar class of the lowest order of\r\npriests, called by Plutarch _cholchytae_, by whom it was bandaged in\r\ngummed cloth; it was then ready for the coffin. Mummies thus prepared\r\nwere considered to represent Osiris. In another method of embalming,\r\ncosting twenty-two minae (about L90), the abdomen was injected with\r\n\"cedar-tree pitch\" ([Greek: kedria]), which, as it would seem from Pliny\r\n(_Nat. Hist._ xvi. 21), was the liquid distillate of the pitch-pine.\r\nThis is stated by Herodotus to have had a corrosive and solvent action\r\non the viscera. After injection the body was steeped a certain number of\r\ndays in natron; the contents of the abdomen were allowed to escape; and\r\nthe process was then complete. The preparation of the bodies of the\r\npoorest consisted simply in placing them in natron for seventy days,\r\nafter a previous rinsing of the abdomen with \"syrmaea.\" The material\r\nprincipally used in the costlier modes of embalming appears to have been\r\nasphalt; wax was more rarely employed. In some cases embalming seems to\r\nhave been effected by immersing the body in a bath of molten bitumen.\r\nTanning also was resorted to. Occasionally the viscera, after treatment,\r\nwere in part or wholly replaced in the body, together with wax figures\r\nof the four genii of Amenti. More commonly they were embalmed in a\r\nmixture of sand and asphalt, and buried in vases, or _canopi_, placed\r\nnear the mummy, the abdomen being filled with chips and sawdust of cedar\r\nand a small quantity of natron. In one jar were placed the stomach and\r\nlarge intestine; in another, the small intestines; in a third, the lungs\r\nand heart; in a fourth, the gall-bladder and liver. Porphyry (_De\r\nabstinentia_, iv. 10) mentions a custom of enclosing the intestines in a\r\nbox and consigning them to the Nile, after a prayer uttered by one of\r\nthe embalmers, but his statement is regarded by Sir J.G. Wilkinson as\r\nunworthy of belief. The body of Nero's wife Poppaea, contrary to the\r\nusage of the Romans, was not burnt, but as customary among other nations\r\nwith the bodies of potentates, was honoured with embalmment (see\r\nTacitus, _Ann._ xvi. 6). The body of Alexander the Great is said to have\r\nbeen embalmed with honey (Statius, _Silv._ iii. 2. 117), and the same\r\nmaterial was used to preserve the corpse of Agesipolis I. during its\r\nconveyance to Sparta for burial. Herodotus states (iii. 24) that the\r\nEthiopians, in embalming, dried the body, rubbed it with gypsum (or\r\nchalk), and, having painted it, placed it in a block of some transparent\r\nsubstance. The Guanches, the aborigines of the Canaries, employed a mode\r\nof embalming similar to that of the Egyptians, filling the hollow caused\r\nby the removal of the viscera with salt and an absorbent vegetable\r\npowder (see Bory de Saint Vincent, _Essais sur les Iles Fortunees_,\r\n1803, p. 495). Embalming was still in vogue among the Egyptians in the\r\ntime of St Augustine, who says that they termed mummies _gabbarae_\r\n(_Serm._ 120, cap. 12).\r\n\r\nIn modern times numerous methods of embalming have been practised. Dr\r\nFrederick Ruysch of Amsterdam (1665-1717) is said to have utilized\r\nalcohol for this purpose. By William Hunter essential oils, alcohol,\r\ncinnabar, camphor, saltpetre and pitch or rosin were employed, and the\r\nfinal desiccation of the body was effected by means of roasted gypsum\r\nplaced in its coffin. J.P. Boudet (1778-1849) embalmed with tan, salt,\r\nasphalt and Peruvian bark, camphor, cinnamon and other aromatics and\r\ncorrosive sublimate. The last-mentioned drug, chloride and sulphate of\r\nzinc, acetate and sulphate of alumina, and creasote and carbolic acid\r\nhave all been recommended by various modern embalmers.\r\n\r\n  See MUMMY; Louis Penicher, _Traite des embaumements_ (Paris, 1669); S.\r\n  Blancard, _Anatomia reformata, et de balsamatione nova methodus_\r\n  (Lugd.

Embankments serve for two main classes of purpose.\r\nOn the one hand, they are used to preserve the level of railways, canals\r\nand roads, in cases where a valley or piece of low-lying ground has to\r\nbe crossed. On the other, they are employed to stop or limit the flow of\r\nwater, either constituting the retaining wells of reservoirs constructed\r\nin connexion with water-supply schemes, or protecting low-lying tracts\r\nof land from river floods or the encroachments of the sea. The word\r\nembankment has thus come to be used for the mass of material, faced and\r\nsupported by a stone wall and protected by a parapet, placed along the\r\nbanks of a river where it passes through a city, whether to guard\r\nagainst floods or to gain additional space. Such is the Thames\r\nEmbankment in London, which carries a broad roadway, while under it runs\r\nthe Underground railway. In this sense an embankment is distinguished\r\nfrom a quay, though the mechanical construction may be the same, the\r\nlatter word being confined to places where ships are loaded and\r\nunloaded, thus differing from the French _quai_, which is used both of\r\nembankments and quays, e.g. the _Quais_ along the Seine at Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBARGO (a Spanish word meaning \"stoppage\"), in international law, the\r\ndetention by a state of vessels within its ports as a measure of public,\r\nas distinguished from private, utility. In practice it serves as a mode\r\nof coercing a weaker state. In the middle ages war, being regarded as a\r\ncomplete rupture between belligerent states, operated as a suspension of\r\nall respect for the person and property of private citizens; an article\r\nof Magna Carta (1215) provided that \"... if there shall be found any\r\nsuch merchants in our land in the beginning of a war, they shall be\r\nattached, without damage to their bodies or goods, until it may be known\r\nunto us, or our Chief Justiciary, how our merchants are treated who\r\nhappen to be in the country which is at war with us; and if ours be safe\r\nthere, theirs shall be safe in our lands\" (art. 48).\r\n\r\nEmbargoes in anticipation of war have long since fallen into disuse, and\r\nit is now customary on the outbreak of war for the belligerents even to\r\ngrant a respite to the enemy's trading vessels to leave their ports at\r\nthe outbreak of war, so that neither ship nor cargo is any longer\r\nexposed to embargo. This has been confirmed in one of the Hague\r\nConventions of 1907 (convention relative to the status of enemy merchant\r\nships at the outbreak of hostilities, Oct. 18, 1907), which provides\r\nthat \"when a merchant ship belonging to one of the belligerent powers is\r\nat the commencement of hostilities in an enemy port, _it is desirable_\r\nthat it should be allowed to depart freely, either immediately, or after\r\na reasonable number of days of grace, and to proceed, after being\r\nfurnished with a pass, direct to its port of destination, or any other\r\nport indicated\" (art. 1). The next article of the same convention limits\r\nthe option apparently granted by the use of the word \"desirable,\"\r\nproviding that \"a merchant ship unable, owing to circumstances of _force\r\nmajeure_, to leave the enemy port within the period contemplated (in the\r\nprevious article), or which was not allowed to leave, _cannot_ be\r\nconfiscated. The belligerent may only detain it, without compensation,\r\nbut subject to the obligation of restoring it after the war, or\r\nrequisition it on payment of compensation\" (art. 2).     (T. Ba.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBASSY, the office of an ambassador, or, more generally, the mission on\r\nwhich an ambassador of one power is sent to another, or the body of\r\nofficial personages attached to such a mission, whether temporary or\r\npermanent. Hence \"embassy\" is often quite loosely used of any mission,\r\ndiplomatic or otherwise. The word is also used of the official residence\r\nof an ambassador. \"Embassy\" was originally \"ambassy,\" the form used in\r\nthe 17th century, but by the time of Johnson considered quite obsolete.\r\n\"Ambassy\" is from the O. Fr. _ambassee_, derived through such forms as\r\nthe Port. _ambassada_, Ital. _ambasciata_ from a lost Med. Lat.\r\n_ambactiata_, _ambactiare_, to go on a mission. (See further AMBASSADOR,\r\nEXTERRITORIALITY and DIPLOMACY.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBER DAYS and EMBER WEEKS, the four seasons set apart by the Western\r\nChurch for special prayer and fasting, and the ordination of clergy,\r\nknown in the medieval Church as _quatuor tempora_, or _jejunia quatuor\r\ntemporum_. The Ember weeks are the complete weeks next following Holy\r\nCross day (September 14), St Lucy's day (December 13), the first Sunday\r\nin Lent and Whitsun day. The Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays of these\r\nweeks are the Ember days distinctively, the following Sundays being the\r\ndays of ordination. These dates are given in the following memorial\r\ndistich with a frank indifference to quantity and metre--\r\n\r\n  \"Vult Crux, Lucia, Cinis, Charismata dia\r\n    Quod det vota pia quarta sequens feria.\"\r\n\r\nThe word has been derived from the A.S. _ymb-ren_, a circuit or\r\nrevolution (from _ymb_, around, and _rennen_, to run); or by process of\r\nagglutination and phonetic decay, exemplified by the Ger. _quatember_,\r\nDutch _quatertemper_ and Dan. _kvatember_, from the Lat. _quatuor\r\ntempora_. The occurrence of the Anglo-Saxon compounds _ymbren-tid_,\r\n_ymbren-wucan_, _ymbren-faestan_, _ymbren-dagas_ for Ember tide, weeks,\r\nfasts, days, favours the former derivation, which is also confirmed by\r\nthe use of the word _imbren_ in the acts of the council of Aenham, A.D.\r\n1009 (\"jejunia quatuor tempora quae _imbren_ vocant\"). It corresponds\r\nalso with Pope Leo the Great's definition, \"jejunia ecclesiastica per\r\ntotius anni circulum distributa.\"\r\n\r\nThe observance of the Ember days is confined to the Western Church, and\r\nhad its origin as an ecclesiastical ordinance in Rome. They were\r\nprobably at first merely the fasts preparatory to the three great\r\nfestivals of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost. A fourth was subsequently\r\nadded, for the sake of symmetry, to make them correspond with the four\r\nseasons, and they became known as the _jejunium vernum_, _aestivum_,\r\n_autumnale_ and _hiemale_, so that, to quote Pope Leo's words, \"the law\r\nof abstinence might apply to every season of the year.\" An earlier\r\nmention of these fasts, as four in number--the first known--is in the\r\nwritings of Philastrius, bishop of Brescia, in the middle of the 4th\r\ncentury. He also connects them with the great Christian festivals (_De\r\nhaeres._ 119). In Leo's time, A.D. 440-461, Wednesday, Friday and\r\nSaturday were already the days of special observance. From Rome the\r\nEmber days gradually spread through the whole of Western Christendom.\r\nUniformity of practice, however, was of somewhat slow growth. Neither in\r\nGaul nor Spain do they seem to have been generally recognized much\r\nbefore the 8th century. Their introduction into Britain appears to have\r\nbeen earlier, dating from Augustine, A.D. 597, acting under the\r\nauthority of Gregory the Great. The general period of the four fasts\r\nbeing roughly fixed, the precise date appears to have varied\r\nconsiderably, and in some cases to have lost its connexion with the\r\nfestivals altogether. The _Ordo Romanus_ fixes the spring fast in the\r\nfirst week of March (then the first month); the summer fast in the\r\nsecond week of June; the autumnal fast in the third week of September;\r\nand the winter fast in the complete week next before Christmas eve.\r\nOther regulations prevailed in different countries, until the\r\ninconveniences arising from the want of uniformity led to the rule now\r\nobserved being laid down under Pope Urban II. as the law of the church,\r\nin the councils of Piacenza and Clermont, A.D. 1095.\r\n\r\nThe present rule which fixes the ordination of clergy in the Ember weeks\r\ncannot be traced farther back than the time of Pope Gelasius, A.D.\r\n492-496. In the early ages of the church ordinations took place at any\r\nseason of the year whenever necessity required. Gelasius is stated by\r\nritual writers to have been the first who limited them to these\r\nparticular times, the special solemnity of the season being in all\r\nprobability the cause of the selection. The rule once introduced\r\ncommended itself to the mind of the church, and its observance spread.\r\nWe find it laid down in the pontificate of Archbishop Ecgbert of York,\r\nA.D. 732-766, and referred to as a canonical rule in a capitulary of\r\nCharlemagne, and it was finally established as a law of the church in\r\nthe pontificate of Gregory VII., c. 1085.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Muratori, _Dissert. de jejun. quat. temp._, c. vii.,\r\n  anecdot. tom. ii. p. 262; Bingham, _Antiq. of the Christ.

V.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBEZZLEMENT (A.-Fr. _embesilement_, from _beseler_ or _besillier_, to\r\ndestroy), in English law, a peculiar form of theft, which is\r\ndistinguished from the ordinary crime in two points:--(1) It is\r\ncommitted by a person who is in the position of clerk or servant to the\r\nowner of the property stolen; and (2) the property when stolen is in the\r\npossession of such clerk or servant. The definition of embezzlement as a\r\nspecial form of theft arose out of the difficulties caused by the legal\r\ndoctrine that to constitute larceny the property must be taken out of\r\nthe possession of the owner. Servants and others were thus able to steal\r\nwith impunity goods entrusted to them by their masters. A statute of\r\nHenry VIII. (1529) was passed to meet this case; and it enacted that it\r\nshould be felony in servants to convert to their own use caskets,\r\njewels, money, goods or chattels delivered to them by their masters.\r\n\"This act,\" says Sir J.F. Stephen (_General View of the Criminal Law of\r\nEngland_), \"assisted by certain subtleties according to which the\r\npossession of the servant was taken under particular circumstances to be\r\nthe possession of the master, so that the servant by converting the\r\ngoods to his own use took them out of his own possession _qua_ servant\r\n(which was his master's possession) and put them into his own possession\r\n_qua_ thief (which was a felony), was considered sufficient for\r\npractical purposes for more than 200 years.\" In 1799 a clerk who had\r\nconverted to his own use a cheque paid across the counter to him by a\r\ncustomer of his master was held to be not guilty of felony; and in the\r\nsame year an act was passed, which, meeting the difficulty in such\r\ncases, enacted that if any clerk or servant, or any person employed as\r\nclerk or servant, should, by virtue of such employment, receive or take\r\ninto his possession any money, bonds, bills, &c., for or in the name or\r\non account of his employers, and should fraudulently embezzle the same,\r\nevery such offender should be deemed to have stolen the same. The same\r\ndefinition is substantially repeated in a Consolidation Act passed in\r\n1827. Numberless difficulties of interpretation arose under these acts,\r\ne.g. as to the meaning of \"clerk or servant,\" as to the difference\r\nbetween theft and embezzlement, &c.\r\n\r\nThe law now in force, or the Larceny Act 1861, defines the offence thus\r\n(section 68):--\"Whosoever, being a clerk or servant, or being employed\r\nfor the purpose or in the capacity of a clerk or servant, shall\r\nfraudulently embezzle any chattel, money or valuable security which\r\nshall be delivered to or received or taken into possession by him for or\r\nin the name or on the account of his master or employer, or any part\r\nthereof, shall be deemed to have feloniously stolen the same from his\r\nmaster or employer, although such chattel, money or security was not\r\nreceived into the possession of such master or employer otherwise than\r\nby the actual possession of his clerk, servant or other person so\r\nemployed, and being convicted thereof shall be liable, at the discretion\r\nof the court, to be kept in penal servitude for any time not exceeding\r\nfourteen years, and not less than three years,\" or imprisonment with or\r\nwithout hard labour for not more than two years. To constitute the\r\noffence thus described three things must concur:--(1) The offender must\r\nbe a clerk or servant; (2) he must receive into his possession some\r\nchattel on behalf of his master; and (3) he must fraudulently embezzle\r\nthe same. A clerk or servant has been defined to be a person bound\r\neither by an express contract of service or by conduct implying such a\r\ncontract to obey the orders and submit to the control of his master in\r\nthe transaction of the business which it is his duty as such clerk or\r\nservant to transact. (Stephen's _Digest of the Criminal Law_, Art. 309.)\r\n\r\nThe Larceny Act 1901, amending sections 75 and 76 of the Larceny Act\r\n1861, also describes similar offences on the part of persons, not being\r\nclerks or servants, to which the name embezzlement is not uncommonly\r\napplied. The act makes the offence of fraudulently misappropriating\r\nproperty entrusted to a person by another, or received by him on behalf\r\nof another a misdemeanour punishable by penal servitude for a term not\r\nexceeding seven years, or to imprisonment, with or without hard labour,\r\nfor a term not exceeding two years. So also trustees fraudulently\r\ndisposing of trust property, and directors of companies fraudulently\r\nappropriating the company's property or keeping fraudulent accounts, or\r\nwilfully destroying books or publishing fraudulent statements, are\r\nmisdemeanants punishable in the same way.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the law of embezzlement is founded mainly on the\r\nEnglish statute passed in 1799, but the statutes of most states are so\r\nframed that larceny includes embezzlement. The latter is sometimes\r\ndenominated statutory larceny. The punishment varies in the different\r\nstates, otherwise there is little substantive difference in the laws of\r\nthe two countries.\r\n\r\nStatutes have been passed in some states providing that one indicted for\r\nlarceny may be convicted of embezzlement. But it is doubtful whether\r\nsuch statutes are valid where the constitution of the state provides\r\nthat the accused must be informed of the nature and cause of the\r\naccusation against him. (See also LARCENY.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBLEM (Gr. [Greek: emblema], something put in or inserted, from [Greek:\r\nemballein], to throw in), a word originally applied in Greek and Latin\r\n(_emblema_) to a raised or inlaid ornament on vases and other vessels,\r\n&c., and also to mosaic or tessellated work. It is in English confined\r\nto a symbolical representation of some object, particularly when used as\r\na badge or heraldic device.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBLEMENTS (from O. Fr. _emblavence de bled_, i.e. corn sprung up above\r\nground), a term applied in English law to the corn and other crops of\r\nthe earth which are produced annually, not spontaneously, but by labour\r\nand industry. Emblements belong therefore to the class of _fructus\r\nindustriales_, or \"industrial growing crops\" (Sale of Goods Act 1893, S\r\n62). They include not only corn and grain of all kinds, but everything\r\nof an artificial and annual profit that is produced by labour and\r\nmanuring, e.g. hemp, flax, hops, potatoes, artificial grasses like\r\nclover, but not fruit growing on trees, which come under the general\r\nrule _quicquid plantatur solo, solo cedit_. Emblements are included\r\nwithin the definition of goods in s. 62 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893.\r\nWhere an estate of uncertain duration terminates unexpectedly by the\r\ndeath of the tenant, or some other event due to no fault of his own, the\r\nlaw gives to the personal representative the profits of crops of this\r\nnature as compensation for the tilling, manuring and sowing of the land.\r\nIf the estate, although of uncertain duration, is determined by the\r\ntenant's own acts, the right to emblements does not arise. The right to\r\nemblements has become of no importance in England since 1851, when it\r\nwas provided by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1851 (s. 1) that any tenant\r\nat rack-rent, whose lease was determined by the death or cesser of the\r\nestate, of a landlord entitled only for his life, or for any other\r\nuncertain interest, shall, instead of emblements, be entitled to hold\r\nthe lands until the expiration of the current year of his tenancy. The\r\nright to emblements still exists, however, in favour of (a) a tenant not\r\nwithin the Landlord and Tenant Act 1851, whose estate determines by an\r\nevent which could not be foreseen, (b) the executor, as against the heir\r\nof the owner in fee of land in his own occupation, (c) an execution\r\ncreditor under a writ directing seizure of goods and chattels. A person\r\nentitled to emblements may enter upon the lands after the determination\r\nof the tenancy for the purpose of cutting and carrying away the crops.\r\nEmblements are liable to distress by the landlord for arrears of rent,\r\nor rent during the period of holding on under the act of 1851 (the\r\nDistress for Rent Act 1737; see Bullen on _Distress_, 4th ed., 1893).\r\n\r\nThe term \"emblements\" is unknown in _Scots law_, but the heir or\r\nrepresentative of a life-rent tenant, a liferenter of lands, has an\r\nanalogous right to reap the crop (on paying a proportion of the rent)\r\nand a right to recompense for labour in tilling the ground. The Landlord\r\nand Tenant Act 1851 (s. 1) was in force in _Ireland_ till 1860, when it\r\nwas replaced by the Land Act 1860, which gave to the tenant an almost\r\nidentical right to emblements (s. 34).\r\n\r\nIn the _United States_ the English common law of emblements has been\r\ngenerally preserved. In North Carolina there has been legislation on the\r\nlines of the English Landlord and Tenant Act 1851. In some states the\r\ntenant is entitled to compensation also from the person succeeding to\r\nthe possession.\r\n\r\n  Under the French Code Civil, the outgoing tenant is entitled to\r\n  convenient housing for the consumption of his fodder and for the\r\n  harvests remaining to be got in (art. 1777). The same rule is in force\r\n  in Belgium (Code Civil, art. 1777); and in Holland (Civil Code, art.\r\n  1635) and Spain (art. 1578). Similar rights are secured to the tenant\r\n  under the German Civil Code (arts. 592 et seq.). French law is in\r\n  force in Mauritius. The common law of England and the Landlord and\r\n  Tenant Act 1851 (14 & 15 Vict., c. 25, s. 1) are in force in many of\r\n  the British colonies acquired by settlement. In other colonies they\r\n  have been recognized by statute (e.g. Victoria, Landlord and Tenant\r\n  Act 1890, No. 1108, ss. 45-48: Tasmania, Landlord and Tenant Act 1874,\r\n  38 Vict. No. 12).\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--English Law: Fawcett on the _Law of Landlord and Tenant_\r\n  (3rd ed., London, 1905); Foa, _Landlord and Tenant_ (4th ed., London,\r\n  1907).

W. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBOSSING, the art of producing raised portions or patterns on the\r\nsurface of metal, leather, textile fabrics, cardboard, paper and similar\r\nsubstances. Strictly speaking, the term is applicable only to raised\r\nimpressions produced by means of engraved dies or plates brought\r\nforcibly to bear on the material to be embossed, by various means,\r\naccording to the nature of the substance acted on. Thus raised patterns\r\nproduced by carving, chiselling, casting and chasing or hammering are\r\nexcluded from the range of embossed work. Embossing supplies a\r\nconvenient and expeditious medium for producing elegant ornamental\r\neffects in many distinct industries; and especially in its relations to\r\npaper and cardboard its applications are varied and important. Crests,\r\nmonograms, addresses, &c., are embossed on paper and envelopes from dies\r\nset in small handscrew presses, a force or counter-die being prepared in\r\nleather faced with a coating of gutta-percha. The dies to be used for\r\nplain embossing are generally cut deeper than those intended to be used\r\nwith colours. Colour embossing is done in two ways--the first and\r\nordinary kind that in which the ink is applied to the raised portion of\r\nthe design. The colour in this case is spread on the die with a brush\r\nand the whole surface is carefully cleaned, leaving only ink in the\r\ndepressed parts of the engraving. In the second variety--called cameo\r\nembossing--the colour is applied to the flat parts of the design by\r\nmeans of a small printing roller, and the letters or design in relief is\r\nleft uncoloured. In embossing large ornamental designs, engraved plates\r\nor electrotypes therefrom are employed, the force or counterpart being\r\ncomposed of mill-board faced with gutta-percha. In working these,\r\npowerful screw-presses, in principle like coining or medal-striking\r\npresses, are employed. Embossing is also most extensively practised for\r\nornamental purposes in the art of bookbinding. The blocked ornaments on\r\ncloth covers for books, and the blocking or imitation tooling on the\r\ncheaper kinds of leather work, are effected by means of powerful\r\nembossing or arming presses. (See BOOK-BINDING.) For impressing embossed\r\npatterns on wall-papers, textiles of various kinds, and felt, cylinders\r\nof copper, engraved with the patterns to be raised, are employed, and\r\nthese are mounted in calender frames, in which they press against\r\nrollers having a yielding surface, or so constructed that depressions in\r\nthe engraved cylinders fit into corresponding elevations in those\r\nagainst which they press. The operations of embossing and colour\r\nprinting are also sometimes effected together in a modification of the\r\nordinary cylinder printing machine used in calico-printing, in which it\r\nis only necessary to introduce suitably engraved cylinders. For many\r\npurposes the embossing rollers must be maintained at a high temperature\r\nwhile in operation; and they are heated either by steam, by gas jets, or\r\nby the introduction of red-hot irons within them. The stamped or\r\nstruck ornaments in sheet metal, used especially in connexion with the\r\nbrass and Britannia-metal trades, are obtained by a process of\r\nembossing--hard steel dies with forces or counterparts of soft metal\r\nbeing used in their production. A kind of embossed ornament is formed on\r\nthe surface of soft wood by first compressing and consequently sinking\r\nthe parts intended to be embossed, then planing the whole surface level,\r\nafter which, when the wood is placed in water, the previously depressed\r\nportion swells up and rises to its original level. Thus an embossed\r\npattern is produced which may be subsequently sharpened and finished by\r\nthe ordinary process of carving (see CHASING and REPOUSSE).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBRACERY (from the O. Fr. _embraseour_, an embracer, i.e. one who\r\nexcites or instigates, literally one who sets on fire, from _embraser_,\r\nto kindle a fire; \"embrace,\" i.e. to hold or clasp in the arms, is from\r\nO. Fr. _embracer_, Lat. _in_ and _bracchia_, arms), in law, the\r\nattempting to influence a juryman corruptly to give his verdict in\r\nfavour of one side or the other in a trial, by promise, persuasions,\r\nentreaties, money, entertainments and the like. It is an offence both at\r\ncommon law and by statute, and punishable by fine and imprisonment. As a\r\nstatutory offence it dates back to 1360. The offence is complete,\r\nwhether any verdict has been given or not, and whether the verdict is in\r\naccordance with the weight of evidence or otherwise. The person making\r\nthe attempt, and any juryman who consents, are equally punishable. The\r\nfalse verdict of a jury, whether occasioned by embracery or otherwise,\r\nwas formerly considered criminal, and jurors were severely punished,\r\nbeing proceeded against by writ of attaint (q.v.). The Juries Act of\r\n1825, in abolishing writs of attaint, made a special exemption as\r\nregards jurors guilty of embracery (S 61). Prosecution for the offence\r\nhas been so extremely rare that when a case occurred in 1891 (_R. v.\r\nBaker_, 113, Cent. Crim. Ct. Sess. Pap. 374) it was stated that no\r\nprecedent could be found for the indictment. The defendant was fined\r\nL200, afterwards reduced to L100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBRASURE, in architecture, the opening in a battlement between the two\r\nraised solid portions or merlons, sometimes called a crenelle (see\r\nBATTLEMENT, CRENELLE); also the splay of a window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBROIDERY (M.E. _embrouderie_, from O. Fr. _embroder_, Mod. Fr.\r\n_broder_), the ornamentation of textile fabrics and other materials with\r\nneedlework. The beginnings of the art of embroidery probably date back\r\nto a very primitive stage in the history of all peoples, since plain\r\nstitching must have been one of the earliest attainments of mankind, and\r\nfrom that it is but a short step to decorative needlework of some kind.\r\nThe discovery of needles among the relics of Swiss lake-dwellings shows\r\nthat their primitive inhabitants were at least acquainted with the art\r\nof stitching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6.--PANEL OF PETIT-POINT EMBROIDERY, WITH A REPRESENTATION OF\r\n  COURTLY FIGURES IN A LANDSCAPE.

The sandy soil and dry climate of\r\nthat country have led to the preservation of woven stuffs and\r\nembroideries of unique historic interest. The principal, and by far the\r\nearliest, known pieces which have a bearing on the present subject,\r\nfound in 1903 in the tomb of Tethmosis (Thoutmosis, or Thothmes) IV. at\r\nThebes, are now in the Cairo Museum. There are three fragments, entirely\r\nof linen, inwrought with patterns in blue, red, green and black (fig.\r\n1). A kind of tapestry method is used, the patterns being wrought upon\r\nthe warp threads of the ground, instead of upon the finished web or\r\nwoven material. Such a process, generally supplemented, as in this case,\r\nby a few stitches of fine needlework, was still in common use at a far\r\nlater time. The largest of the three fragments at Cairo bears, in\r\naddition to rows of lotus flowers and papyrus inflorescences, a\r\ncartouche containing the name of Amenophis (Amenhotep) II. (c. 15th\r\ncentury B.C.); another is inwrought with the name of Tethmosis III.\r\n(c. 16th century B.C.).[1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Fragment of a linen robe, found in the tomb of\r\nTethmosis (Thothmes) IV. at Thebes, and now in the Cairo Museum. The\r\ncartouche has the name of Amenophis (Amenhotep) II. (c. 15th century\r\nB.C.).]\r\n\r\nNo other embroidered stuffs which can be assigned to so early a date\r\nhave hitherto come to light in the Nile valley (nor indeed elsewhere),\r\nand the student who wishes to gain a fuller knowledge of the textile\r\npatterns of the ancient Egyptians must be referred to the wall-paintings\r\nand sculptured reliefs which have been preserved in considerable\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nFrom the ancient civilizations of Babylon and Assyria no fragments of\r\nembroidery, nor even of woven stuffs, have come down to us. The fine\r\nseries of wall-reliefs from Nineveh in the British Museum give some idea\r\nof the geometrical and floral patterns and diapers which adorned the\r\nrobes of the ancient Assyrians. The discovery of the ruins of the palace\r\nof Darius I. (521-485 B.C.) at Susa in 1885 has thrown some light upon\r\nthe textile art of the ancient Persians. They evidently owed much to the\r\nnations whom they had supplanted. The famous relief from this palace\r\n(now in the Louvre) represents a procession of archers, wearing long\r\nrobes covered with small diaper patterns, perhaps of embroidery.\r\n\r\nThe exact significance of the words used in the book of Exodus in\r\ndescribing the robes of Aaron (ch. xxviii.) and the hangings and\r\nornaments of the Tabernacle (ch. xxvi.) cannot be determined, and the\r\n\"broidered work\" of the prophecy of Ezekiel (ch. xxvii.) at a later time\r\nis also of uncertain meaning. It seems likely that much of this ancient\r\nwork was of the tapestry class, such as we have found in the early\r\nfragments from Thebes.\r\n\r\nThe methods of the ancient Greek embroiderer, or \"variegator\" ([Greek:\r\npoikiltes]) to whom woven garments were submitted for enrichment, can\r\nonly be conjectured. The _peplos_ or woven cloth made every fifth year\r\nto cover or shade the statue of Athena in the Parthenon at Athens, and\r\ncarried at the Panathenaic festival,[2] was ornamented with the battles\r\nof the gods and giants. The late Dr J.H. Middleton thought that very\r\npossibly most of the elaborate work upon these _peploi_ was done by the\r\nneedle. That true embroidery, in the modern sense--the decoration by\r\nmeans of the needle of a finished woven material--was practised among\r\nthe ancient Greeks, has been demonstrated by the finding of some textile\r\nfragments in graves in the Crimea; these are now in the Hermitage at St\r\nPetersburg. One of them, of purple woollen material, from a tomb\r\nassigned to the 4th century B.C., is embroidered in wools of different\r\ncolours with a man on horseback, honeysuckle ornament and tendrils.\r\nAnother woollen piece, attributed to the following century, has a stem\r\nand arrow-head leaves worked in gold thread.[3]\r\n\r\nIn turning to ancient Rome, it is well first briefly to notice Pliny's\r\naccount of the craft (_Nat. Hist._ viii.), as recording the views\r\ncurrent in Rome at his time (1st century A.D.). After relating that\r\nHomer mentions embroidered garments (_pictas vestes_), he states that\r\nthe Phrygians first used the needle for embroidered robes, which were\r\nthence called Phrygionian (_Phrygioniae_), and that Attalic garments\r\nwere named from Attalus II., king of Pergamum (159-138 B.C.), the\r\ninventor of the art of embroidering in gold. He further relates that\r\nBabylon gave the name to embroideries of divers colours, for the\r\nproduction of which that city was famous. By the Romans the art was\r\ndesignated as \"painting with the needle\" (_acu pingere_), a term used by\r\nVirgil in speaking of the decoration of robes, by Ovid (who describes it\r\nas an art taught by Minerva), and by Roman writers generally when\r\nreferring to embroidery.[4] It is to be regretted that no examples have\r\nbeen discovered in the neighbourhood of the Roman capital. For\r\nembroideries made under Roman influence we must again look to Egypt.\r\nThey formed the decoration of garments[5] and mummy-wrappings from the\r\ncemeteries in Upper and Middle Egypt, which have been so extensively\r\nrifled of late years. Those of Roman type date approximately from the\r\nfirst five centuries of the Christian era. The earliest represent human\r\nfigures, animals, birds, geometrical and interlacing ornaments, vases,\r\nfruit, flowers and foliage (especially the vine). They are generally\r\ndone in purple wool and undyed linen thread by the tapestry process\r\nemployed in Egypt at least fifteen centuries earlier, as we have seen;\r\nmost of the patterns have had the lines more clearly marked out by the\r\nordinary method of needlework. Towards the end of this period a greater\r\nchoice of colours is seen, and Christian symbols appear. At this time\r\nexamples worked entirely upon the finished web are found (fig. 2). The\r\ntransition is easy from such work to the veritable \"needle-paintings,\"\r\nrepresenting scenes from the gospels, produced in Egypt shortly after\r\n(fig. 3). Such embroideries are evidently akin to those mentioned by\r\nBishop Asterius (330-410), who describes the garments worn by effeminate\r\nChristians as painted like the walls of their houses.[6]\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Justinian (527-565) onwards for some centuries, the art\r\nof Europe, embroidery with the rest, was dominated by that of the\r\nByzantine empire. To trace the progress of the highly conventionalized\r\nByzantine style, becoming more rigid and stereotyped as time passes,\r\nbelongs to the general history of art, and such a task cannot be\r\nattempted here. Perhaps the most remarkable example of all which have\r\nsurvived to illustrate the work of the Byzantine embroiderers is the\r\nblue silk robe known as the dalmatic of Charlemagne or of Leo III., in\r\nthe sacristy of St Peter's at Rome (fig. 4). According to the present\r\nconsensus of opinion it belongs to a later time than either of those\r\ndignitaries, dating most probably from the 12th century.[7] In front is\r\nrepresented Christ enthroned as Judge of the world, a youthful but\r\nmajestic figure; on the back is the Transfiguration. These, as well as\r\nthe minor subjects, are explained by Greek inscriptions. The wide\r\ninfluence of Byzantine art gradually died out after the Latin sack of\r\nConstantinople in the year 1204, although the style lingered, and\r\nlingers still, in certain localities, notably at Mount Athos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Embroidered panel from a linen garment, with a\r\nrepresentation of the Annunciation and the Salutation.

Under the Norman\r\nkings of Sicily the style was strongly oriental, consequent upon the\r\nearlier occupation of the island by the Saracens, and upon the\r\nemployment of Saracenic craftsmen by the Normans. The magnificent red\r\nsilk mantle at Vienna, embroidered in gold thread with a date-palm and\r\ntwo lions springing upon camels, and enriched with pearls and enamel\r\nplaques, bears round the edge an Arabic inscription, recording that it\r\nwas made in the royal factory of the capital of Sicily (Palermo) in the\r\nyear 528 (= A.D. 1134). At that time Roger, the first Norman king, was\r\non the throne. Another of the imperial coronation-robes--a linen alb\r\nwith gold embroidery--is also at Vienna.[8] An inscription in Latin and\r\nArabic states that it was made in the year 1181, under the reign of\r\nWilliam II. (Norman king of Sicily, 1166-1189).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Embroidered robe known as the \"Dalmatic of\r\nCharlemagne,\" or of Leo III., preserved in the sacristy of St Peter's at\r\nRome. Byzantine work, probably of the 12th century.]\r\n\r\nFrom about that time distinct national styles began to develop in\r\ndifferent places. In tracing the progress of the embroiderer's art\r\nduring the middle ages we must rely mainly upon the many fine examples\r\nof ecclesiastical work which have been preserved. The costumes of men\r\nand women, as well as curtains and hangings and such articles of\r\ndomestic use, were often richly adorned with embroidery. These have\r\nmostly perished; while the careful preservation and comparatively\r\ninfrequent use of the vestments and other objects devoted to the service\r\nof the church have given us tangible evidence of the attainments of the\r\nmedieval embroiderer. Much of this work was produced in convents, but\r\nold documents show that in monasteries also were to be found men known\r\nfor their skill in needlework. Other names, both of men and women, are\r\nrecorded, showing that the craft was by no means exclusively confined to\r\nmonastic foundations. Gilds of embroiderers existed far back in medieval\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIn England the craft has been a favourite employment for many centuries,\r\nand persons of all ranks have occupied their spare hours at needlework.\r\nSome embroidered fragments, found in 1826-1827 in the tomb of St\r\nCuthbert at Durham, and now kept in the cathedral library, were worked,\r\nchiefly in gold thread, by order of Aelfflaeda, queen of Edward the Elder,\r\nfor Fridestan, bishop of Winchester, early in the 10th century. In the\r\nlater part of the following century the \"Bayeux tapestry\" was\r\nproduced--a work of unique importance (Plate I. fig. 7). It is a band of\r\nlinen, more than 230 ft. long, embroidered in coloured wools with the\r\nstory of the Norman conquest of England. (See BAYEUX TAPESTRY.)\r\n\r\nSome fragments of metallic embroidery on silk, of the 12th and 13th\r\ncenturies, may be seen in the library of Worcester cathedral. They were\r\nremoved from the coffins of two bishops, William de Blois (1218-1236)\r\nand Walter de Cantelupe (1236-1266). A fragment of gold embroidery from\r\nthe tomb of the latter bishop is preserved in the Victoria and Albert\r\nMuseum at South Kensington, and others are in the British Museum. In the\r\n13th century English embroidery was famous throughout western Europe,\r\nand many embroidered objects are described in inventories of that time\r\nas being _de opere anglicano_. During that century, and the early part\r\nof the next, English work was at its best. The most famous example is\r\nthe \"Syon cope\" at South Kensington, belonging to the latter half of the\r\n13th century (see COPE, Plate I. fig. 2). It represents the coronation\r\nof the Virgin, the Crucifixion, the archangel Michael transfixing the\r\ndragon, the death and burial of the Virgin, our Lord meeting Mary\r\nMagdalene in the garden, the Apostles and the hierarchies of angels. The\r\nbroad orphrey is embroidered with a series of heraldic shields (Plate\r\nII. fig. 9). Other embroideries of the period are at Steeple Aston,\r\nChesterfield (Col. Butler-Bowden), Victoria and Albert and British\r\nmuseums, Rome (St John Lateran), Bologna, Pienza, Anagni, Ascoli, St\r\nBertrand de Comminges, Lyons museum, Madrid (archaeological museum),\r\nToledo and Vich.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the 14th and 15th centuries embroideries produced\r\nin England were not equal to the earlier work. Towards the end of the\r\nlatter century, and until the dissolution of the monasteries in the\r\nnext, much ecclesiastical embroidery of effective design was done, and\r\nmany examples are still to be seen in churches throughout the country.\r\nIn the Tudor period the costumes of the wealthy were often richly\r\nadorned with needlework. The portraits of King Henry VIII., Queen\r\nElizabeth and their courtiers show how magnificent was the embroidery\r\nused for such purposes. Many examples, especially of the latter reign,\r\nworked with very effective and beautiful floral patterns, have come down\r\nto these times. A kind of embroidery known as \"black work\", done in\r\nblack silk on linen, was popular during the same reign. A tunic\r\nembroidered for Queen Elizabeth, with devices copied from contemporary\r\nwoodcuts, is an excellent example of this work. It now belongs to the\r\nViscount Falkland. Another class of work, popular at the same time, was\r\nclosely worked in wools and silks on open-mesh material like canvas,\r\nwhich was entirely covered by the embroidery. Figures in rich costume\r\nwere often introduced (Plate I. fig. 6). This method was much practised\r\nin France, and the term applied to it in that country, \"_au petit\r\npoint_,\" has become generally used. Throughout the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies embroidery in England, though sometimes lacking in good taste,\r\nmaintained generally a high standard, and that done to-day, based on the\r\nstudy of old examples, need not fear comparison with any modern work.\r\nDuring these three centuries bold floral patterns for hangings, curtains\r\nand coverlets have been usual (Plate III. fig. 13), but smaller works,\r\nsuch as samplers, covers of work-boxes, and pictorial and landscape\r\nsubjects (fig. 5), have been produced in large numbers. In the 18th\r\ncentury gentlemen's coats and waistcoats and ladies' dresses were\r\nextensively embroidered.\r\n\r\nIn France, embroidery, like all the arts practised by that nation, has\r\nbeen characterized by much grace and beauty, and many good specimens\r\nbelonging to different periods are known. The vestments associated with\r\nthe name of St Thomas of Canterbury at Sens may be either of French or\r\nEnglish work (12th century). To the later part of the following century\r\nbelongs a band of embroidery, representing the coronation of the Virgin,\r\nthe Adoration of the Magi, the presentation in the Temple, and other\r\nsubjects beneath Gothic arches, preserved in the Hotel-Dieu at Chateau\r\nThierry. The mitre of Jean de Marigny, archbishop of Rouen (1347-1351),\r\nin the museum at Evreux, embroidered with figures of St Peter and St\r\nEloy, may be regarded as representative of 14th-century work. An\r\naltar-frontal with the Annunciation embroidered in silks and gold and\r\nsilver upon a blue silk damask ground, now in the museum at Lille, is a\r\nvery beautiful example of Franco-Flemish art in the second half of the\r\n15th century. It was originally in the church at Noyelles-lez-Seclin. An\r\nembroidery more characteristically French, and belonging to the same\r\ncentury, is in the museum at Chartres. It is a triptych, having in the\r\nmiddle a _pieta_, on the left wing St John the Evangelist, and on the\r\nright St Catherine of Alexandria. Each leaf has a canopy of architecture\r\nrepresented in perspective. In the 16th century an effective style of\r\nembroidery was practised in France; the pattern is generally a graceful\r\ncombination of floral and scroll forms, cut out of velvet, satin or\r\nsilk, and applied to a thick woollen cloth. Later work, chiefly of a\r\nfloral character, has served for the decoration of costumes,\r\necclesiastical vestments, curtains and hangings, and the seats and backs\r\nof chairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Oval picture in silk embroidery: Fame scattering\r\nFlowers over Shakespeare's Tomb. English work of the 18th century.]\r\n\r\nUnder the rule of the dukes of Burgundy in the 15th century art in the\r\nsouthern provinces of the Netherlands prospered greatly, and able\r\nartists were found to meet the wishes of those munificent rulers. The\r\nlocal schools of painting, which flourished under their patronage,\r\nappear to have very considerably influenced the embroiderers' art. Great\r\ncare and pains were given to reproduce as accurately as possible the\r\npainted cartoon or picture which served as the model. The heads are\r\nindividualized, and the folds of the draperies are laboriously worked\r\nout in detail. The masonry of buildings, the veinings of marble, and the\r\narchitectural enrichments are often represented with careful fidelity,\r\nand landscape backgrounds are shown in every detail. As in the case of\r\nthe tapestries of the Netherlands--the finest which the world has\r\nseen--there can be no doubt that patrons of art and donors, when\r\nrequiring embroideries to be made, secured the services of eminent\r\npainters for the designs. There are many examples of such careful work.\r\nA set of vestments known as the _ornement de la Toison d'Or_, now in the\r\nHof-museum at Vienna, is embroidered in the most minute manner with\r\nsacred subjects and figures of saints and angels. The stiff disposal of\r\nmany of these figures, within flattened hexagons arranged in zones, is\r\nnot pleasing, but the needlework is most remarkable for skill and\r\ncarefulness. They are of 15th-century work. A cope belonging to the\r\nsecond half of that century was given to the cathedral of Tournay by\r\nGuillaume Fillatre, abbot of St Bertin at St Omer, and bishop of Tournay\r\n(d. 1473). It is now in the museum there. Upon the orphreys and hood are\r\nrepresented the seven Works of Mercy. The body of the cope, of plain red\r\nvelvet, is powdered with stags' heads and martlets (the heraldic\r\nbearings of the bishop); between the antlers of the stags is worked in\r\neach case the initial letter of the bishop's name, and the morse is\r\nembroidered with his arms. Some panels of embroidery, once decorating an\r\naltar in the abbey of Grimbergen, and now at Brussels, illustrate the\r\nbest class of Flemish needlework in the 16th century. The scenes are\r\ntaken from the Gospel: the marriage at Cana, Christ in the house of the\r\nPharisee, Christ in the house of Zacchaeus, the Last Supper, and the\r\nsupper at Emmaus. In the museum at Bern there are some embroideries of\r\ngreat historic and artistic interest, found in the tent of Charles the\r\nBold, duke of Burgundy, after his defeat at Granson in 1476. They\r\ninclude some armorial panels and two tabards or heralds' coats. A tabard\r\nof the following century, with the royal arms of Spain in applied work,\r\nand most probably of Flemish origin, is preserved in the archaeological\r\nmuseum at Ghent.\r\n\r\nThe later art of Holland was largely influenced by the Dutch conquests\r\nin the East Indies at the end of the 16th century, and the subsequent\r\nfounding of the Dutch East India Company. Embroideries were among the\r\narticles produced in the East under Dutch influence for exportation to\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nMuch embroidery for ecclesiastical purposes has been executed in Belgium\r\nof late years. It follows medieval models, but is lacking in the\r\nqualities which make those of so much importance in the history of the\r\nart.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps little worthy of special notice in Italy before the\r\nbeginning of the 14th century, but the embroideries produced at that\r\ntime show great skill and are very beautiful. The names of two\r\nFlorentine embroiderers of the 14th century--both men--have come down to\r\nus, inscribed upon their handiwork. A fine frontal for an altar, very\r\ndelicately worked in gold and silver and silks of many colours, is\r\npreserved in the archaeological museum at Florence. The subject in the\r\nmiddle is the coronation of the Virgin; on either side is an arcade with\r\nfigures of apostles and saints. The embroiderer's name is worked under\r\nthe central subject: _Jacobus Cambi de Floretia me fecit MCCCXXXVIII._\r\nThe other example is in the basilica at Manresa in Spain. It also is an\r\naltar-frontal, worked in silk and gold upon an embroidered gold ground.\r\nThere is a large central panel representing the Crucifixion, with nine\r\nscenes from the Gospel on each side. The embroidered inscription is as\r\nfollows: _Geri Lapi rachamatore me fecit in Florentia._ It is of\r\n14th-century work. An embroidered orphrey in the Victoria and Albert\r\nMuseum belongs to the early part of the same century. It represents the\r\nAnnunciation, the coronation of the Virgin and figures of apostles and\r\nsaints beneath arches. In the spandrels are the orders of angels with\r\ntheir names in Italian. In the best period of Italian art successful\r\npainters did not disdain to design for embroidery. Francesco Squarcione\r\n(1394-1474), the founder of the Paduan school of painting, and master of\r\nMantegna, is called in a document of the year 1423 a tailor and\r\nembroiderer (_sartor et recamator_). It is recorded that Antonio del\r\nPollaiuolo painted cartoons which were carried out in embroidery,[9] and\r\nPierino del Vaga, according to Vasari, did likewise. In the 16th and\r\n17th centuries large numbers of towels and linen covers were embroidered\r\nin red, green or brown silk with borders of floral patterns, sometimes\r\n(especially in the southern provinces) combined with figure subjects and\r\nbird and animal forms (Plate IV. fig. 15). Another type of embroidery\r\npopular at the same time, both in Italy and Spain, is known as applique\r\n(or applied) work. The pattern is cut out and applied to a\r\nbright-coloured ground, frequently of velvet, as in the example\r\nillustrated (Plate III. fig. 14). The later embroidery of Sicily follows\r\nthat of the mainland. A remarkable coverlet, quilted and padded with\r\nwool so as to throw the design into relief, is shown to be of Sicilian\r\norigin by the inscriptions which it bears (Plate VI. fig. 18). It\r\nrepresents scenes from the story of Tristan, agreeing in the main part\r\nwith the _novella_ entitled \"La Tavola Rotonda o l'istoria di Tristano.\"\r\nThe quilt dates from the end of the 14th century. Many pattern-books for\r\nembroidery and lace were published in Italy in the 16th and 17th\r\ncenturies.[10]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 11.--SILK PANEL, EMBROIDERED WITH A HANGING LANTERN.

Hispano-Moorish\r\nembroideries of the medieval period usually have interlacing patterns\r\ncombined with Arabic inscriptions. In the 15th and 16th centuries\r\nItalian influence becomes evident. Later the effects of the Spanish\r\nconquests in Asia are seen. Eastern influence is, however, stronger in\r\nthe case of the Portuguese, who seized Goa, on the west coast of the\r\nIndian peninsula, early in the 16th century, and during the whole of\r\nthat century held the monopoly of the eastern trade. Many large\r\nembroideries were produced in the Indies, showing eastern floral\r\npatterns mingled with representations of Europeans, ships and coats of\r\narms. Embroideries done in Portugal in the 16th and 17th centuries\r\nstrongly reflect the influence of oriental patterns.\r\n\r\nGerman embroidery of the 12th and 13th centuries adheres closely to the\r\ntraditions of Byzantine art. A peculiarity of much medieval German work\r\nis a tendency to treat the draperies of the figures as flat surfaces to\r\nbe covered with diaper patterns, showing no folds. A cope from\r\nHildesheim cathedral, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, is a\r\ntypical illustration of such work, dating from the end of the 13th\r\ncentury. It is embroidered in silk upon linen with the martyrdom of\r\napostles and saints. Other specimens of embroidery in this manner may be\r\nseen at Halberstadt. An altar-frontal from Rupertsburg (Bingen),\r\nbelonging to the earlier years of the 13th century, is now in the\r\nBrussels museum. It is of purple silk, embroidered with Christ in\r\nmajesty and figures of saints. It was no doubt made in the time of\r\nSiegfried, archbishop of Mainz (1201-1230), who is represented upon it.\r\nA type of medieval German embroidery is done in white linen thread on a\r\nloose linen ground--a sort of darning-work (Plate II. fig. 10). Earlier\r\nspecimens of this work are often diversified by using a variety of\r\nstitches tending to form diaper patterns. The use of long scrolling\r\nbands with inscriptions explaining the subjects represented is more\r\nusual in German work than in that of any other country. In the 15th\r\ncentury much fine embroidery was produced in the neighbourhood of\r\nCologne. Later German work shows a preference for bold floral patterns,\r\nsometimes mingled with heraldry; the larger examples are often worked in\r\nwool on a woollen cloth ground (Plate II. fig. 8). The embroidery of the\r\nnorthern nations (Denmark, Scandinavia, Iceland) was later in\r\ndevelopment than that of the southern peoples. Figure subjects evidently\r\nbelonging to as late a period as the 17th century are still disposed in\r\nformal rows of circles, and accompanied by primitive ornamental forms\r\n(Plate III. fig. 12). A remarkable early embroidered fabric covers the\r\nrelics of St Knud (Canute, king of Denmark, 1080-1086) in his shrine in\r\nthe church dedicated to him at Odense. It is apparently contemporary\r\nwork. The pattern consists of displayed eagles within oval compartments,\r\nin blue on a red ground.\r\n\r\nIn Greece and the islands of the eastern Mediterranean embroidery has\r\nbeen much employed for the decoration of costumes, portieres and\r\nbed-curtains. Large numbers have been acquired in Crete (Plate IV. fig.\r\n16), and patterns of a distinctive character are also found in Rhodes,\r\nCos, Patmos and other islands. Some examples show traces of the\r\ninfluence of the Venetian trading settlements in the archipelago in the\r\n16th and 17th centuries. Among the Turks a great development of the arts\r\nfollowed upon the conquest of Asia Minor and the Byzantine territory in\r\nEurope. Their embroideries show a preference for floral forms--chiefly\r\nroses, tulips, carnations and hyacinths--which are treated with great\r\ndecorative skill.\r\n\r\nThe use of embroidery in Asia--especially in India, China, Turkestan and\r\nPersia--dates back to very early times. The conservatism of all these\r\npeoples renders the date of surviving examples often difficult to\r\nestablish, but the greater number of such embroideries now to be seen in\r\nEurope are certainly of no great age.\r\n\r\nIndia has produced vast quantities of embroideries of varying\r\nexcellence. The fine woollen shawls of Kashmir are widely famed; their\r\nfirst production is supposed to date back to a remote period. The\r\nsomewhat gaudy effect of many Indian embroideries is at times\r\nintensified by the addition of beetles' wings, tinsel or fragments of\r\nlooking-glass. China is the original home of the silkworm, and the\r\ntextile arts there reached an advanced stage at a date long before that\r\nof any equally skilful work in Europe. Embroideries worked there are\r\ngenerally in silk threads on a ground of the same material. Such work is\r\nlargely used for various articles of costume, and for coverlets,\r\nscreens, banners, chair-covers and table-hangings. The ornaments upon\r\nthe robes especially are prescribed according to the rank of the wearer.\r\nThe designs include elaborate landscapes with buildings and figures,\r\ndragons, birds, animals, symbolic devices, and especially flowers (Plate\r\nIII. fig. 11). Dr Bushell states that the stuff to be embroidered is\r\nfirst stretched upon a frame, on pivots, and that pattern-books with\r\nwoodcuts have been published for the workers' guidance. A kind of\r\nembroidery exported in large quantities from Canton to Europe rivals\r\npainting in the variety and gradation of its colours, and in the\r\nsmoothness and regularity of its surface.\r\n\r\nEmbroidery in Japan resembles in many ways that of China, the country\r\nwhich probably supplied its first models. As a general rule, Japanese\r\nwork is more pictorial and fanciful than that of China, and the\r\nstitching is looser. It frequently happens that the brush has been used\r\nto add to the variety of the embroidered work, and in other cases the\r\nneedle has been an accessory upon a fabric already ornamented with\r\nprinting or painting. Japanese work is characterized generally by bold\r\nand broad treatment, and especial skill is shown in the representation\r\nof landscapes--figures, rocks, waterfalls, animals, birds, trees,\r\nflowers and clouds being each rendered by a few lines. More elaborate\r\nare the large temple hangings, the pattern being frequently thrown into\r\nrelief, and completely covering the ground material.\r\n\r\nEmbroidery in Persia has been used to a great extent for the decoration\r\nof carpets, for prayer or for use at the bath (Plate V. fig. 17). Robes,\r\nhangings, curtains, tablecovers and portieres are also embroidered. A\r\npreference is shown for floral patterns, but the Mahommedans of Persia\r\nhad no scruples about introducing the forms of men and animals--the\r\nformer engaged in hawking or hunting, or feasting in gardens. Panels\r\nembroidered with close diagonal bands of flowers were made into loose\r\ntrousers for women, now obsolete. The embroidered shawls of Kerman are\r\nwidely celebrated. Hangings and covers of cloth patchwork have been\r\nembroidered in many parts of Persia, more particularly at Resht and\r\nIspahan.\r\n\r\nIn Turkestan, and especially at Bokhara, excellent embroideries have\r\nbeen, and are, produced, some patterns being of a bold floral type, and\r\nothers conventionalized into hooked and serrated outlines. The work is\r\nmost usually in bright-coloured silks, red predominating, on a linen\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nIn North Africa the embroidery of Morocco and Algeria deserves notice;\r\nthe former inclines more to geometrical forms and the latter to patterns\r\nof a floral character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 17.--LINEN PRAYER CARPET, QUILTED AND EMBROIDERED IN CHAIN STITCH\r\n  WITH COLOURED SILKS, CHIEFLY WHITE, YELLOW, GREEN AND RED.\r\n\r\n  The border consists of a wide band set between two narrow ones, each\r\n  with a waved continuous stem with blossoms in the wavings. Similar\r\n  floral scrolling and leafy stem ornament fills the space beyond the\r\n  pointed shape at the upper end, which is edged with acanthus leaf\r\n  devices. The main ground below the niche or pointed shape is a\r\n  blossoming plant, with balanced bunches of flowers between which are\r\n  leaves, formally arranged in a pointed oval shape.

It\r\nis built at a height of 2854 ft. on a plateau that rises above the right\r\nbank of the Durance. It is 27-1/2 m. by rail from Briancon and 24 m.\r\nfrom Gap. Its ramparts were demolished in 1884. In 1906 the communal\r\npop. (including the garrison) was 3752. Besides the Tour Brune (11th\r\ncentury) and the old archiepiscopal palace, now occupied by government\r\noffices, barracks, &c., the chief object of interest in Embrun is its\r\nsplendid cathedral church, which dates from the second half of the 12th\r\ncentury. Above its side door, called the _Real_, there existed till 1585\r\n(when it was destroyed by the Huguenots) a fresco, probably painted in\r\nthe 13th century, representing the Madonna: this was the object of a\r\ncelebrated pilgrimage for many centuries. Louis XI. habitually wore on\r\nhis hat a leaden image of this Madonna, for which he had a very great\r\nveneration, since between 1440 and 1461, during the lifetime of his\r\nfather, he had been the dauphin, and as such ruler of this province.\r\n\r\nEmbrun was the _Eburodunum_ or _Ebredunum_ of the Romans, and the chief\r\ntown of the province of the Maritime Alps. The episcopal see was founded\r\nin the 4th century, and became an archbishopric about 800. In 1147 the\r\narchbishops obtained from the emperor Conrad III. very extensive\r\ntemporal rights, and the rank of princes of the Holy Roman Empire. In\r\n1232 the county of the Embrunais passed by marriage to the dauphins of\r\nViennois. In 1791 the archiepiscopal see was suppressed, the region\r\nbeing then transferred to the diocese of Gap, so that the once\r\nmetropolitan cathedral church is now simply a parish church. The town\r\nwas sacked in 1585 by the Huguenots and in 1692 by the duke of Savoy.\r\nHenri Arnaud (1641-1721), the Waldensian pastor and general, was born at\r\nEmbrun.\r\n\r\n  See A. Albert, _Histoire du diocese d'Embrun_ (2 vols., Embrun, 1783);\r\n  M. Fornier, _Histoire generale des Alpes Maritimes ou Cottiennes et\r\n  particuliere de leur metropolitaine Embrun_ (written 1626-1643),\r\n  published by the Abbe Paul Guillaume (3 vols., Paris and Gap,\r\n  1890-1891); A. Fabre, _Recherches historiques sur le pelerinage des\r\n  rois de France a N.D. d'Embrun_ (Grenoble, 1859); A. Sauret, _Essai\r\n  historique sur la ville d'Embrun_ (Gap, 1860).     (W. A. B. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBRYOLOGY. The word embryo is derived from the Gr. [Greek: embryon],\r\nwhich signified the fruit of the womb before birth. In its strict sense,\r\ntherefore, embryology is the study of the intrauterine young or embryo,\r\nand can only be pursued in those animals in which the offspring are\r\nretained in the uterus of the mother until they have acquired, or nearly\r\nacquired, the form of the parent. As a matter of fact, however, the word\r\nhas a much wider application than would be gathered from its derivation.\r\nAll animals above the Protozoa undergo at the beginning of their\r\nexistence rapid growth and considerable changes of form and structure.\r\nDuring these changes, which constitute the development of the animal,\r\nthe young organism may be incapable of leading a free life and obtaining\r\nits own food. In such cases it is either contained in the body of the\r\nparent or it is protruded and lies quiescent within the egg membranes;\r\nor it may be capable of leading an independent life, possessing in a\r\nfunctional condition all the organs necessary for the maintenance of its\r\nexistence. In the former case the young organism is called an\r\n_embryo_,[1] in the latter a _larva_. It might thus be concluded that\r\nembryology would exclude the study of larvae, in which the whole or the\r\ngreater part of the development takes place outside the parent and\r\noutside the egg. But this is not the case; embryology includes not only\r\na study of embryos as just defined, but also a study of larvae. In this\r\nway the scope of the subject is still further widened. As long as\r\nembryology confines its attention to embryos, it is easy to fix its\r\nlimits, at any rate in the higher animals. The domain of embryology\r\nceases in the case of viviparous animals at birth, in the case of\r\noviparous animals at hatching; it ceases as soon as the young form\r\nacquires the power of existing when separated from the parent, or when\r\nremoved from the protection of the egg membranes. But as soon as\r\npost-embryonic developmental changes are admitted within the scope of\r\nthe subject, it becomes on close consideration difficult to limit its\r\nrange. It must include all the developmental processes which take place\r\nas a result of sexual reproduction. A man at birth, when he ceases to be\r\nan embryo, has still many changes besides those of simple growth to pass\r\nthrough. The same remark applies to a young frog at the metamorphosis. A\r\nchick even, which can run about and feed almost immediately after\r\nhatching, possesses a plumage very different from that of the full-grown\r\nbird; a starfish at the metamorphosis is in many of its features quite\r\ndifferent from the form with which we are familiar. It might be\r\nattempted to meet this difficulty by limiting embryology to a study of\r\nall those changes which occur in the organism before the attainment of\r\nthe adult state. But this merely shifts the difficulty to another\r\nquarter, and makes it necessary to define what is meant by the adult\r\nstate. At first sight this may seem easy, and no doubt it is not\r\ndifficult when man and the higher animals alone are in question, for in\r\nthese the adult state may be defined comparatively sharply as the stage\r\nof sexual maturity. After that period, though changes in the organism\r\nstill continue, they are retrogressive changes, and as such might fairly\r\nbe excluded from any account of development, which clearly implies\r\nprogression, not retrogression. But, as so often happens in the study of\r\norganisms, formulae which apply quite satisfactorily to one group\r\nrequire modifications when others are considered. Does sexual maturity\r\nalways mark the attainment of the adult state? Is the Axolotl adult when\r\nit acquires its reproductive organs? Can a larval Ctenophore, which\r\nacquires functional reproductive glands and still possesses the power of\r\npassing into the form ordinarily described as adult in that group, be\r\nconsidered to have reached the end of its development? Or--to take the\r\ncase of those animals, such as _Amphioxus_, _Balanoglossus_, and many\r\nsegmented worms in which important developmental processes occur, e.g.\r\nformation of new gill slits, of gonadial sacs, or even of whole segments\r\nof the body, long after the power of reproduction has been acquired--how\r\nis the attainment of the adult state to be defined, for it is clear that\r\nin them the attainment of sexual maturity does not correspond with the\r\nend of growth and development? If, then, embryology is to be regarded as\r\nincluding not only the study of embryos, but also that of larvae, i.e.\r\nif it includes the study of the whole developmental history of the\r\nindividual--and it is impossible to treat the subject rationally unless\r\nit is so regarded--it becomes exceeding difficult to fix any definite\r\nlimit to the period of life with which embryology concerns itself. The\r\nbeginning of this period can be fixed, but not the end, unless it be the\r\nend of life itself, i.e. death. The science of embryology, then, is the\r\nscience of individual development, and includes within its purview all\r\nthose changes of form and structure, whether embryonic, larval or\r\npost-larval, which characterize the life of the individual. The\r\nbeginning of this period is precise and definite--it is the completion\r\nof the fertilization of the ovum, in which the life of the individual\r\nhas its start. The end, on the other hand, is vague and cannot be\r\nprecisely defined, unless it be death, in which case the period of life\r\nwith which embryology concerns itself is coincident with the life of the\r\nindividual. To use the words of Huxley (\"Cell Theory,\" _Collected\r\nWorks_, vol. i. p. 267): \"Development, therefore, and life are, strictly\r\nspeaking, one thing, though we are accustomed to limit the former to the\r\nprogressive half of life merely, and to speak of the retrogressive\r\nhalf as decay, considering an imaginary resting-point between the two as\r\nthe adult or perfect state.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Reproduction.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of reproduction, the sexual and the asexual. The\r\nsexual method has for its results an increase of the number of kinds of\r\nindividual or organism, whereas the asexual affords an increase in the\r\nnumber of individuals of the same kind. If the asexual method of\r\nreproduction alone existed, there would, so far as our knowledge at\r\npresent extends, be no increase in the number of kinds of organism: no\r\nnew individuality could arise. The first establishment of a new kind of\r\nindividual by the sexual process is effected in a very similar manner in\r\nall Metazoa. The parent produces by a process of unequal fission, which\r\ntakes place at a part of the body called the reproductive gland, a small\r\nliving organism called the reproductive cell. There are always two kinds\r\nof reproductive cells, and these are generally produced by different\r\nanimals called the male and female respectively (when they are produced\r\nby the same animal it is said to be hermaphrodite). The reproductive\r\ncell produced by the male is called the spermatozoon, and that produced\r\nby the female, the ovum. These two organisms agree in being small\r\nuninucleated masses of protoplasm, but differ considerably in form. They\r\nare without the organs of nutrition, &c., which characterize their\r\nparents, but the ovum nearly always possesses, stored up within its\r\nprotoplasm, a greater or less quantity of vitelline matter or food-yolk,\r\nwhile the spermatozoon possesses in almost all cases the power of\r\nlocomotion. The object with which these two minute and simple organisms\r\nare produced is to fuse with one another and give rise to one resultant\r\nuninucleated (for the nuclei fuse) organism or cell, which is called the\r\n_zygote_. This process of fusion between the two kinds of reproductive\r\ncells, which are termed _gametes_, is called conjugation: it is the\r\nprocess which is sometimes spoken of as the fertilization of the ovum,\r\nand its result is the establishment of a new individual. This new\r\nindividual at first is simply a uninucleated mass of living matter,\r\nwhich always contains a certain amount of food-yolk, and is generally\r\nbounded by a delicate cuticular membrane called the vitelline membrane.\r\nIn form the newly established zygote resembles the female gamete or\r\novum--so much so, indeed, that it is frequently called the ovum; but it\r\nmust be clearly understood that although the bulk of its matter has been\r\nderived from the ovum, it consists of ovum and spermatozoon, and, as\r\nshown by its subsequent behaviour, the spermatozoon has quite as much to\r\ndo with determining its vital properties as the ovum.\r\n\r\n  To the unaided eye the main difference between the newly formed\r\n  zygotes of different species of animals is that of bulk, and this is\r\n  due to the amount of food-yolk held in suspension in the protoplasm.\r\n  The ovum of the fowl is 30 mm. in diameter, that of the frog 1.75 mm.,\r\n  while the ova of the rabbit and _Amphioxus_ have a diameter of .l mm.\r\n  The food-yolk is deposited in the ovum as a result of the vital\r\n  activity of its protoplasm, while the ovum is still a part of the\r\n  ovary of the parent. It is an inert substance which is used as food\r\n  later on by the developing embryo, and it acts as a dilutant of the\r\n  living matter of the ovum. It has a profound influence on the\r\n  subsequent developmental process. The newly formed zygotes of\r\n  different species of animals have undoubtedly, as staved above, a\r\n  certain family resemblance to one another; but however great this\r\n  superficial resemblance may be, the differences must be most profound,\r\n  and this fact becomes at once obvious when the properties of these\r\n  remarkable masses of matter are closely investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Causes of development.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of so many other forms of matter, the more important\r\nproperties of the zygote do not become apparent until it is submitted to\r\nthe action of external forces. These forces constitute the external\r\nconditions of existence, and the properties which are called forth by\r\ntheir action are called the acquired characters of the organism. The\r\ninvestigation of these properties, particularly of those which are\r\ncalled forth in the early stages of the process, constitutes the science\r\nof Embryology. With regard to the manifestation of these properties,\r\ncertain points must be clearly understood at the outset:--(1) If the\r\nzygote is withheld from the appropriate external influences, e.g. if a\r\nplant-seed be kept in a box free from moisture or at a low temperature,\r\nno properties are evolved, and the zygote remains apparently unchanged;\r\n(2) the acquisition of the properties which constitutes the growth and\r\ndevelopment of the organism proceeds in a perfectly definite sequence,\r\nwhich, so far as is known, cannot be altered; (3) just as the features\r\nof the growing organism change under the continued action of the\r\nexternal conditions, so the external conditions themselves must change\r\nas the organism is progressively evolved. With regard to this last\r\nchange, it may be said generally that it is usually, if not always,\r\neffected by the organism itself, making use of the properties which it\r\nhas acquired at earlier stages of its growth, and acting in response to\r\nthe external conditions. There is, to use a phrase of Mr Herbert\r\nSpencer, a continuous adjustment between the external and internal\r\nrelations. For every organism a certain succession of conditions is\r\nnecessary if the complete and normal evolution of properties is to take\r\nplace. Within certain limits, these conditions may vary without\r\ninterfering with the normal evolution of the properties, though such\r\nvariations are generally responded to by slight but unimportant\r\nvariation of the properties (variation of acquired characters). But if\r\nthe variation of the conditions is too great, the evolved properties\r\nbecome abnormal, and are of such a nature as to preclude the normal\r\nevolution of the organism; in other words, the action of the conditions\r\nupon the organism is injurious, causing abortions and, ultimately,\r\ndeath. For many organisms the conditions of existence are well known for\r\nall stages of life, and can be easily imitated, so that they can be\r\nreared artificially and kept alive and made to breed in\r\nconfinement--e.g. the common fowl. But in a large number of cases it is\r\nnot possible, through ignorance of the proper conditions, or on account\r\nof the difficulty of imitating them, to make the organism evolve all its\r\nproperties. For instance, there are many marine larvae which have never\r\nbeen reared beyond a certain point, and there are some organisms which,\r\neven when nearly full-grown--a stage of life at which it is generally\r\nmost easy to ascertain and imitate the natural conditions--will not\r\nlive, or at any rate will not breed, in captivity. Of late years some\r\nnaturalists have largely occupied themselves with experimental\r\nobservation of the effects on certain organisms of marked and definite\r\nchanges of the conditions, and the name of Developmental Mechanics (or\r\n_Physiology of Development_) has been applied to this branch of study\r\n(see below).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gametogeny.\r\n\r\n  In normal fertilization, as a rule, only one spermatozoon fuses with\r\n  the ovum. It has been observed in some eggs that a membrane, formed\r\n  round the ovum immediately after the entrance of the spermatozoon,\r\n  prevents the entrance of others. If than one spermatozoon enters, a\r\n  corresponding number of male pronuclei are formed, and the subsequent\r\n  development, if it takes place at all, is abnormal and soon ceases. An\r\n  egg by ill-treatment (influence of chloroform, carbonic acid, &c.) can\r\n  be made to take more than one spermatozoon. In some animals it appears\r\n  that several spermatozoa may normally enter the ovum (some Arthropoda,\r\n  Selachians, Amphibians and Mammals), but of these only one forms a\r\n  male pronucleus (see below), the rest being absorbed. Gametogeny is\r\n  the name applied to the formation of the gametes, i.e. of the ova and\r\n  spermatozoa. The cells of the reproductive glands are the germ cells\r\n  (_oogonia_, _spermatogonia_). They undergo division and give rise to\r\n  the progametes, which in the case of the female are sometimes called\r\n  _oocytes_, in the case of the male _spermatocytes_. The oocytes are\r\n  more familiarly called the ovarian ova. The nucleus of the oocyte is\r\n  called the germinal vesicle. The oocyte (progamete) gives rise by\r\n  division to the ovum or true gamete, the nucleus of which is called\r\n  the _female pronucleus_. As a general rule the oocyte divides\r\n  unequally twice, giving rise to two small cells called polar bodies,\r\n  and to the ovum. The first formed polar body frequently divides when\r\n  the oocyte undergoes its second and final division, so that there are\r\n  three polar bodies as well as the ovum resulting from the division of\r\n  the oocyte or progamete. Sometimes the ovum arises from the oocyte by\r\n  one division only, and there is only one polar body (e.g. mouse,\r\n  Sobotta, _Arch. f. mikr. Anat., 1895_, p. 15). The polar bodies are\r\n  oval, but as a rule they are so small as to be incapable of\r\n  fertilization. They may therefore be regarded as abortive ova. In one\r\n  case, however (see Francotte, _Bull. Acad. Belg._ (3), xxxiii., 1897,\r\n  p. 278), the first formed polar body is nearly as large as the ovum,\r\n  and is sometimes fertilized and develops. The spermatogonia are the\r\n  cells of the testis; these produce by division the spermatocytes\r\n  (progametes), which divide and give rise to the spermatids. In most\r\n  cases which have been investigated the divisions by which the\r\n  spermatids arise from the spermatocytes are two in number, so that\r\n  each spermatocyte gives origin to four spermatids. Each spermatid\r\n  becomes a functional spermatozoon or male gamete. The gametogeny of\r\n  the male therefore closely resembles that of the female, differing\r\n  from it only in the fact that all the four products of the progamete\r\n  become functional gametes, whereas in the female only one, the ovum,\r\n  becomes functional, the other three (polar bodies) being abortive. In\r\n  the spermatogenesis of the bee, however, the spermatocyte only divides\r\n  once, giving rise to a small polar-body-like structure and one\r\n  spermatid (Meves, _Anat. Anzeiger_, 24, 1904, pp. 29-32). The nucleus\r\n  of the male gamete is not called the male pronucleus, as would be\r\n  expected, that term being reserved for the second nucleus which\r\n  appears in the ovum after fertilization. As this is in all probability\r\n  derived entirely from the nucleus of the spermatozoon, we should be\r\n  almost justified in calling the nucleus of the spermatozoon the male\r\n  pronucleus. In most forms in which the formation of the gametes from\r\n  the progamete has been accurately followed, and in which the progamete\r\n  of both sexes divides twice in forming the gametes, the division of\r\n  the nucleus presents certain peculiarities. In the first place,\r\n  between the first division and the second it does not enter into the\r\n  resting state, but immediately proceeds to the second division. In the\r\n  second place, the number of chromosomes which appear in the final\r\n  divisions of the progametes and assist in constituting the nuclei of\r\n  the gametes is half the number which go to constitute the new nuclei\r\n  in the ordinary nuclear divisions of the animal. The number of\r\n  chromosomes of the nucleus of the gamete is therefore reduced, and the\r\n  divisions by which the gametes arise from the progametes are called\r\n  reducing (_maiotic_) divisions. It is not certain, however, that this\r\n  phenomenon is of universal occurrence, or has the significance which\r\n  is ordinarily attributed to it. In the parthenogenetic ova of certain\r\n  insects, e.g. _Rhodites rosae_ (Henking), _Nematus lacteus_\r\n  (Doncaster, _Quart. Journal Mic. Science_, 49, 1906, pp. 561-589),\r\n  reduction does not occur, though two polar bodies are formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fertilization.\r\n\r\n  As soon as the spermatozoon has conjugated with the ovum, a second\r\n  nucleus appears in the ovum. This is undoubtedly derived from the\r\n  spermatozoon, possibly from its nucleus only, and is called the male\r\n  pronucleus. It possesses in the adjacent protoplasm a well-marked\r\n  centrosome. The general rule appears to be that the female pronucleus\r\n  is without a centrosome, and that no centrosome appears in the female\r\n  in the divisions by which the gamete arises from the progamete. If\r\n  this is true, the centrosome of the zygote nucleus must be entirely\r\n  derived from that of the male pronucleus. This accounts for the fact,\r\n  which has been often observed, that the female pronucleus is not\r\n  surrounded by protoplasmic radiations, whereas such radiations are\r\n  present round the male pronucleus in its approach to the female. In\r\n  the mouse the subsequent events are as follow:--Both pronuclei assume\r\n  the resting form, the chromatin being distributed over the nuclear\r\n  network, and the nuclei come to lie side by side in the centre of the\r\n  egg. A long loop of chromatin then appears in each nucleus and divides\r\n  up into twelve pieces, the chromosomes. The centrosome now divides,\r\n  the membranes of both nuclei disappear, and a spindle is formed. The\r\n  twenty-four chromosomes arrange themselves at the centre of this\r\n  spindle and split longitudinally, so that forty-eight chromosomes are\r\n  formed. Twenty-four of these, twelve male and twelve female, as it is\r\n  supposed, travel to each pole of the spindle and assist in giving rise\r\n  to the two nuclei. At the next nuclear division twenty-four\r\n  chromosomes appear in each nucleus, each of which divides\r\n  longitudinally; and so in all subsequent divisions. The fusion of the\r\n  two pronuclei is sometimes effected in a manner slightly different\r\n  from that described for the mouse. In _Echinus_, for instance, the two\r\n  pronuclei fuse, and the spindle and chromosomes are formed from the\r\n  zygote nucleus, whereas in the mouse the two pronuclei retain their\r\n  distinctness during the formation of the chromosomes. There appears,\r\n  however, to be some variation in this respect: cases have been\r\n  observed in the mouse in which fusion of the pronuclei occurs before\r\n  the separation of the chromosomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Parthenogenesis.\r\n\r\n  Parthenogenesis, or development of the female gamete without\r\n  fertilization, is known to occur in many groups of the animal kingdom.\r\n  Attempts have been made to connect this phenomenon with peculiarities\r\n  in the gametogeny. For instance, it has been said that parthenogenetic\r\n  ova form only one polar body. But, as we have seen, this is sometimes\r\n  the case in eggs which are fertilized, and parthenogenetic ova are\r\n  known which form two polar bodies, e.g. ova of the honey-bee which\r\n  produce drones (_Morph. Jahrb._ xv., 1889, p. 85). ova of Rotifera\r\n  which produce males (_Zool. Anzeiger_, xx., 1897, p. 455), ova of some\r\n  saw-flies and gall flies which produce females (L. Doncaster, _Quart.\r\n  Journ. Mic. Sc._, 49, 1906, pp. 561-589). Again it has been asserted\r\n  that in parthenogenetic eggs the polar bodies are not extruded from\r\n  the ovum; in such cases, though the nucleus divides, those of its\r\n  products which would in other cases be extruded in polar bodies remain\r\n  in the protoplasm of the ovum. But this is not a universal rule, for\r\n  in some cases of parthenogenesis polar bodies are extruded in the\r\n  usual way (_Aphis_, some Lepidoptera), and in some fertilized eggs the\r\n  polar bodies are retained in the ovum.\r\n\r\n  It is quite probable that parthenogenesis is more common than has been\r\n  supposed, and it appears that there is some evidence to show that ova,\r\n  which in normal conditions are incapable of developing without\r\n  fertilization, may yet develop if subjected to an altered\r\n  environment. For instance, it has been asserted that the addition of a\r\n  certain quantity of chloride of magnesium and other substances to\r\n  sea-water will cause the unfertilized ova of certain marine animals\r\n  (_Arbacia_, _Chaetopterus_) to develop (J. Loeb, _American Journal of\r\n  Physiology_, ix., 1901, p. 423); and according to M.Y. Delage\r\n  (_Comptes rendus_, 135, 1902. Nos. 15 and 16) such development may\r\n  occur after the formation of polar bodies, the chromosomes undergoing\r\n  reduction and the full number being regained in the segmenting stage.\r\n  These experiments, if authenticated, suggest that ova have the power\r\n  of development, but are not able to exercise it in their normal\r\n  surroundings. There is reason to believe that the same assertion may\r\n  be made of spermatozoa. Phenomena of the nature of parthenogenesis\r\n  have never been observed in the male gamete, but it has been suggested\r\n  by A. Giard (_Cinquantenaire de la Soc. de Biol._, 1900) that the\r\n  phenomenon of the so-called fertilization of an enucleated ovum which\r\n  has been described by T. Boveri and Delage in various eggs, and which\r\n  results in development up to the larval form (_merogony_), is in\r\n  reality a case in which the male gamete, unable to undergo development\r\n  in ordinary circumstances on account of its small size and\r\n  specialization of structure has obtained a nutritive environment which\r\n  enables it to display its latent power of development. Moreover, A.M.\r\n  Giard suggests that in some cases of apparently normal fertilization\r\n  one of the pronuclei may degenerate, the resultant embryo being the\r\n  product of one pronucleus only. In this way he explains certain cases\r\n  of hybridization in which the paternal (rarely the maternal) type is\r\n  exclusively reproduced. For instance, in the batrachiate Amphibia,\r\n  Heron Royer succeeded in 1883 in rearing, out of a vast number of\r\n  attempts, a few hybrids between a female _Pelobates fuscus_ and a male\r\n  _Rana fusca_; the product was a _Rana fusca_. He also crossed a female\r\n  _Bufo vulgaris_ with a male _Bufo calamita_; in the few cases which\r\n  reached maturity the product was obviously a _Bufo calamita_. Finally,\r\n  H.E. Ziegler (_Arch. f. Ent.-Mech._, 1898, p. 249) divided the\r\n  just-fertilized ovum of a sea-urchin in such a way that each half had\r\n  one pronucleus; the half with the male pronucleus segmented and formed\r\n  a blastula, the other degenerated. It is said that in a few species of\r\n  animals males do not occur, and that parthenogenesis is the sole means\r\n  of reproduction (a species of Ostracoda among Crustacea; species of\r\n  Tenthredinidae, Cynipidae and Coccidae among Insecta); this is the\r\n  thelytoky of K.T.E. von Siebold. The number of species in which males\r\n  are unknown is constantly decreasing, and it is quite possible that\r\n  the phenomenon does not exist. Parthenogenesis, however, is\r\n  undoubtedly of frequent occurrence, and is of four kinds, namely, (1)\r\n  that in which males alone are produced, e.g. honey-bees\r\n  (_arrhenotoky_); (2) that in which females only are produced\r\n  (_thelytoky_), as in some saw-flies; (3) that in which both sexes are\r\n  produced (_deuterotoky_), as in some saw-flies; (4) that in which\r\n  there is an alternation of sexual and parthenogenetic generations, as\r\n  in Aphidae, many Cynipidae, &c. It would appear that \"parthenogenesis\r\n  does not favour the production of one sex more than another, but it is\r\n  clear that it decidedly favours the production of a brood that is\r\n  entirely of one sex, but which sex that is differs according to\r\n  circumstances\" (D. Sharp, _Cambridge Natural History_, \"Insects,\" pt.\r\n  i. p. 498). In some Insecta and Crustacea exceptional parthenogenesis\r\n  occurs: a certain proportion of the eggs laid are capable of\r\n  undergoing either the whole or a part of development\r\n  parthenogenetically, e.g. _Bombyx mori_, &c. (A. Brauer, _Arch. f.\r\n  mikr. Anat._, 1893; consult also E. Maupas on parthenogenesis of\r\n  Rotifera, _Comp. rend._, 1889-1891, and R. Lauterborn, _Biol.\r\n  Centralblatt_, xviii., 1898, p. 173).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Determination of sex.\r\n\r\n  The question of the determination of sex may be alluded to here. Is\r\n  sex determined at the act of conjugation of the two gametes? Is it, in\r\n  other words, an unalterable property of the zygote, a genetic\r\n  character? Or does it depend upon the conditions to which the zygote\r\n  is subjected in its development? In other words, is it an acquired\r\n  character? It is impossible in the present state of knowledge to\r\n  answer these questions satisfactorily, but the balance of evidence\r\n  appears to favour the view that sex is an unalterable, inborn\r\n  character. Thus those twins which are believed to come from a split\r\n  zygote are always of the same sex, members of the same litter which\r\n  have been submitted to exactly similar conditions are of different\r\n  sexes, and all attempts to determine the sex of offspring in the\r\n  higher animals by treatment have failed. On the other hand, the male\r\n  bee is a portion of a female zygote--the queen-bee. The same remark\r\n  applies to the male Rotifer, in which the zygote always gives rise to\r\n  a female, from which the male arises parthenogenetically, but in these\r\n  cases it does not appear that the production of males is in any way\r\n  affected by external conditions (see R.C. Punnett, _Proc. Royal Soc._,\r\n  78 B, 1906, p. 223). It is said that in human societies the number of\r\n  males born increases after wars and famines, but this, if true, is\r\n  probably due to an affection of the gametes and not of the young\r\n  zygote. For a review of the whole subject see L. Cuenot, _Bull. sci.\r\n  France et Belgique_, xxxii., 1899, pp. 462-535.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cleavage.\r\n\r\nThe first change the zygote undergoes in all animals is what is\r\ngenerally called the segmentation or cleavage of the ovum. This consists\r\nessentially of the division of the nucleus into a number of nuclei,\r\naround which the protoplasm sooner or later becomes arranged in the\r\nmanner ordinarily spoken of as cellular. This division of the nucleus is\r\neffected by the process called binary fission; that is to say, it first\r\ndivides into two, then each of these divides simultaneously again into\r\ntwo, giving four nuclei; each of these after a pause again\r\nsimultaneously divides into two. So the process continues for some time\r\nuntil the ovum becomes possessed of a large number of nuclei, all of\r\nwhich have proceeded from the original nucleus by a series of binary\r\nfissions. This division of the nucleus, which constitutes the essential\r\npart of the cleavage of the ovum, continues through the whole of life,\r\nbut it is only in the earliest period that it is distinguished by a\r\ndistinct name and used to characterize a stage of development. The\r\nnuclear division of cleavage is usually at first a rhythmical process;\r\nall the nuclei divide simultaneously, and periods of nuclear activity\r\nalternate with periods of rest. Nuclear divisions may be said to be of\r\nthree kinds, according to the accompanying changes in the surrounding\r\nprotoplasm: (1) accompanied by no visible change, e.g. the\r\nmultinucleated Protozoon _Actinosphaerium_; (2) accompanied by a\r\nrearrangement of the protoplasm around each nucleus, but not by its\r\ndivision into two separate masses, e.g. the division which results in\r\nthe formation of a colony of Protozoa; (3) accompanied by the division\r\nof the protoplasm into two parts, so that two distinct cells result,\r\ne.g. the divisions by which the free wandering leucocytes are produced,\r\nthe reproduction of uninuclear Protozoa, &c. In the cleavage of the ovum\r\nthe first two of these methods of division are found, but probably not\r\nthe third. At one time it was thought that the nuclear divisions of\r\ncleavage were always of the third kind, and the result of cleavage was\r\nsupposed to be a mass of isolated cells, which became reunited in the\r\nsubsequent development to give rise to the later connexion between the\r\ntissues which were known to exist. But in 1885 it was noticed that in\r\nthe ovum of _Peripatus capensis_ (A. Sedgwick, _Quart. Journ. Mic.\r\nScience_, xxv., 1885, p. 449) the extra-nuclear protoplasm did not\r\ndivide in the cleavage of the ovum, but merely became rearranged round\r\nthe increasing nuclei; the continuity of the protoplasm was not broken,\r\nbut persisted into the later stages of growth, and gave rise to the\r\ntissue-connexions which undoubtedly exist in the adult. This discovery\r\nwas of some importance, because it rendered intelligible the unity of\r\nthe embryo so far as its developmental processes are concerned, the\r\nmaintenance of this unity being somewhat surprising on the previous\r\nview. On further inquiry and examination it was found that the ova of\r\nmany other animals presented a cleavage essentially similar to that of\r\n_Peripatus_. Indeed, it was found that the nuclear divisions of cleavage\r\nwere of the first two kinds just described. In some eggs, e.g. the\r\nAlcyonaria, the first nuclear divisions are effected on the first plan,\r\ni.e. they take place without at first producing any visible effect upon\r\nthe protoplasm of the egg. But in the later stages of cleavage the\r\nprotoplasm becomes arranged around each nucleus and related to it as to\r\na centre. In the majority of eggs, however, the protoplasm, though not\r\nundergoing complete cleavage, becomes rearranged round each nucleus as\r\nthese are formed. The best and clearest instance of this is afforded by\r\nmany Arthropodan eggs, in which the nucleus of the just-formed zygote\r\ntakes up a central position, where it undergoes its first division,\r\nsubsequent divisions taking place entirely within the egg and not in any\r\nway affecting its exterior. The result is to give rise to a nucleated\r\nnetwork or foam-work of protoplasm, ramifying through the yolk-particles\r\nand containing these in its meshes.\r\n\r\nIn other Arthropodan eggs the cleavage is on the so-called\r\ncentrolecithal type, in which the dividing nuclei pass to the cortex of\r\nthe ovum, and the surface of the ovum becomes indented with grooves\r\ncorresponding to each nucleus. In this kind of cleavage all the\r\nso-called segments are continuous with the central undivided yolk-mass.\r\nIt sometimes happens that in Arthropods the egg breaks up into masses,\r\nwhich cannot be said to have the value of cells, as they are frequently\r\nwithout nuclei. In other eggs, characterized by a considerable amount of\r\nyolk, e.g. the ova of Cephalopoda, and of the Vertebrata with much yolk,\r\nthe first nucleus takes up an eccentric position in a small patch of\r\nprotoplasm which is comparatively free from yolk-particles. This patch\r\nis the germinal disc, and the nuclear divisions are confined to it and\r\nto the transitional region, where it merges into the denser yolk which\r\nmakes up the bulk of the egg. At the close of segmentation the germinal\r\ndisc consists of a number of nuclei, each surrounded by its own mass of\r\nprotoplasm, which is, however, not separated from the protoplasm round\r\nthe neighbouring nuclei, as was formerly supposed, but is continuous at\r\nthe points of contact. In this manner the germinal disc has become\r\nconverted into the blastoderm, which consists of a small\r\nwatch-glass-shaped mass of so-called cells resting on, but continuous\r\nwith, the large yolk-mass. It is characteristic of this kind of ovum\r\nthat there is always a row of nuclei, called the yolk-nuclei, placed in\r\nthe denser yolk immediately adjacent to the blastoderm. These nuclei are\r\ncontinually undergoing division, one of the products of division,\r\ntogether with a little of the sparse yolk protoplasm, passing into the\r\nblastoderm to reinforce it (so-called formative cells). The other\r\nproduct of the dividing yolk-nuclei remains in the yolk, in readiness\r\nfor the next division. In this manner nucleated masses of protoplasm are\r\ncontinually being added to the periphery of the blastoderm and assisting\r\nin its growth. But it must be borne in mind that all the nucleated\r\nmasses of which the blastoderm consists are in continuity with each\r\nother and with the sparse protoplasmic reticulum of the subjacent yolk.\r\n\r\nIn the great majority of eggs, then, the nuclear division of cleavage is\r\nnot accompanied by a complete division of the ovum into separate cells,\r\nbut only by a rearrangement of the protoplasm, which produces, indeed,\r\nthe so-called cellular arrangement, and an appearance only of separate\r\ncells. But there still remain to be mentioned those small eggs in which\r\nthe amount of yolk is inconsiderable, and in which division of the\r\nnuclei does appear to be accompanied by a complete division of the\r\nsurrounding protoplasm into separate unconnected cells--ova of many\r\nAnnelida, Mollusca, Echinoderma, &c., and of Mammalia amongst\r\nVertebrata. In the case of these also (G.F. Andrews, _Zool. Bulletin_,\r\nii., 1898) it has been shown that the apparently separate spheres are\r\nconnected by a number of fine anastomosing threads of a hyaline\r\nprotoplasm, which are not easy to detect and are readily destroyed by\r\nthe action of reagents. It is therefore probable that the divisions of\r\nthe nuclei in cleavage are in no case accompanied by complete division\r\nof the surrounding protoplasm, and the organism in the cleavage stage is\r\na continuous whole, as it is in all the other stages of its existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Division of embryo.\r\n\r\nOf late years a great number of experiments have been made to discover\r\nthe effects of dividing the embryo during its cleavage, and of\r\ndestroying certain portions of it. These experiments have been made with\r\nthe object of testing the view, held by some authorities, that certain\r\nsegments are already set apart in cleavage to give rise to certain adult\r\norgans, so that if they were destroyed the organs in question could not\r\nbe developed. The results obtained have not borne out this view.\r\nSpeaking generally, it may be said that they have been different\r\naccording to the stage at which the separation was effected and the\r\nconditions under which the experiment was carried out. If the experiment\r\nbe made at a sufficiently early stage, each part, if not too small, will\r\ndevelop into a normal, though small, embryo. In some cases the embryo\r\nremained imperfect for a certain time after the experiment, but the loss\r\nis eventually made good by regeneration. (For a summary of the work done\r\non this subject see R.S. Bergh, _Zool. Centralblatt_, vii., 1900, p. 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  The layer theory.\r\n\r\nThe end of cleavage is marked by the commencement of the differentiation\r\nof the organs. The first differentiation is the formation of the layers.\r\nThese are three in number, being called respectively the ectoderm,\r\nendoderm and mesoderm, or, in embryos in which at their first appearance\r\nthey lie like sheets one above the other, the epiblast, hypoblast and\r\nmesoblast. The layers are sometimes spoken of as the primary organs, and\r\ntheir importance lies in the fact that they are supposed to be generally\r\nhomologous throughout the series of the Metazoa. This view, which is\r\nbased partly on their origin and partly on their fate, had great\r\ninfluence on the science of comparative anatomy during the last thirty\r\nyears of the 19th century, for the homology of the layers being admitted,\r\nthey afforded a kind of final court of appeal in determining questions of\r\ndoubtful homologies between adult organs. Great importance was therefore\r\nattached to them by embryologists, and both their mode of development and\r\nthe part which they play in forming the adult organs were examined with\r\nthe greatest care. It is very unusual for all the layers to be\r\nestablished at the same time. As a general rule the ectoderm and\r\nendoderm, which may be called the primary layers, come first, and later\r\nthe mesoderm is developed from one or other of them. There are two main\r\nmethods in which the first two are differentiated--invagination and\r\ndelamination. The former is generally found in small eggs, in which the\r\nembryo at the close of cleavage assumes the form of a sphere, having a\r\nfluid or gelatinous material in its centre, and bounded externally by a\r\nthin layer of protoplasm, in which all the nuclei are contained. Such a\r\nsphere is called a blastosphere, and may be regarded as a spherical mass\r\nof protoplasm, of which the central portion is so much vacuolated that it\r\nseems to consist entirely of fluid. The central part of the blastosphere\r\nis called the segmentation cavity or blastocoel. The blastosphere soon\r\ngives rise, by the invagination of one part of its wall upon the other,\r\nand a consequent obliteration of the segmentation cavity, to a\r\ndouble-walled cup with a wide opening, which, however, soon becomes\r\nnarrowed to a small pore. This cup-stage is called the gastrula stage;\r\nthe outer wall of the gastrula is the ectoderm, and its inner the\r\nendoderm; while its cavity is the enteron, and the opening to the\r\nexterior the blastopore. Origin of the primary layers by delamination\r\noccurs universally in eggs with large yolks (Cephalopoda and many\r\nVertebrata), and occasionally in others. In it cleavage gives rise to a\r\nsolid mass, which divides by delamination into two layers, the ectoderm\r\nand endoderm. The main difference between the two methods of development\r\nlies in the fact that in the first of them the endoderm at its first\r\norigin shows the relations which it possesses in the adult, namely, of\r\nforming the epithelial wall of the enteric space, whereas in the second\r\nmethod the endoderm is at first a solid mass, in which the enteric space\r\nmakes its appearance later by excavation. In the delaminate method the\r\nenteric space is at first without a blastopore, and sometimes it never\r\nacquires this opening, but a blastopore is frequently formed, and the\r\ntwo-layered gastrula stage is reached, though by a very different route\r\nfrom that taken in the formation of the invaginate gastrula. According to\r\nthe layer-theory, these two layers are homologous throughout the series\r\nof Metazoa; their limits can always be accurately defined, they give rise\r\nto the same organs in all cases, and the adult organs (excluding the\r\nmesodermal organs) can be traced back to one or other of them with\r\nabsolute precision. Thus the ectoderm gives rise to the epidermis, to the\r\nnervous system, and to the lining of the stomodaeum and proctodaeum, if\r\nsuch parts of the alimentary canal are present. The endoderm, on the\r\nother hand, gives rise to the lining of the enteron, and of the glands\r\nwhich open into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mesoderm.\r\n\r\nSo far as these two layers are concerned, and excluding the mesoderm, it\r\nwould appear that the layer-theory does apply in a very remarkable\r\nmanner to the whole of the Metazoa. But even here, when the actual facts\r\nare closely scanned, there are found to be difficulties, which appear to\r\nindicate that the theory may not perhaps be such an infallible guide as\r\nit seems at first sight. Leaving out of consideration the case of the\r\nMammalia, in which the differentiation of the segmented ovum is not into\r\nectoderm and endoderm, and the case of the sponges, the most important\r\nof these difficulties concern the stomodaeum and proctodaeum. The best\r\ncase to examine is that of _Peripatus capensis_, in which the blastopore\r\nis at first a long slit, and gives rise to both the mouth and the anus\r\nof the adult. Here there is always found at the lips of the blastopore,\r\nand extending for a short distance inwards as enteric lining, a certain\r\namount of tissue, which by its characters must be regarded as ectoderm.\r\nNow, in the closure of the blastopore between the mouth and anus, this\r\ntissue, which at the mouth and anus develops into the lining of the\r\nstomodaeum and proctodaeum, is left inside, and actually gives rise to\r\nthe median ventral epithelium of the alimentary canal. Hence the\r\ndevelopment of _Peripatus capensis_ suggests the conclusion, if we\r\nstrictly apply the layer-theory, that a considerable portion of the true\r\nmesenteron is lined by ectoderm, and is not homologous with the\r\ncorresponding portion of the mesenteron of other animals--a conclusion\r\nwhich will on all hands be admitted to be absurd. The difficulties in\r\nthe application of the layer-theory become vastly greater when the\r\norigin and fate of the mesoderm is considered. The mesoderm is, if we\r\nmay judge from the number of organs which are derived from it, much the\r\nmost important of the three layers. It generally arises later than the\r\nothers, and in its very origin presents difficulties to the theory,\r\nwhich are much increased when we consider its history. It is generally,\r\nthough not always, developed from the endoderm, either as hollow\r\noutgrowths containing prolongations of the enteric cavity, which become\r\nthe coelom, or as solid proliferations. But in some groups the mesoderm\r\nis actually laid down in cleavage, and is present at the end of that\r\nprocess. In others it is entirely derived from the ectoderm (_Peripatus\r\ncapensis_). In yet others it is partly derived from endoderm and partly\r\nfrom ectoderm (primitive streak of amniotic Vertebrates). Finally, in\r\nwhatever manner the first rudiments are developed, it frequently\r\nreceives considerable reinforcements from one of the primary layers. For\r\ninstance, the structure known as the nerve crest of the vertebrate\r\nembryo is not, as was formerly supposed, exclusively concerned with the\r\nformation of the spinal nerves and ganglia, but contributes largely to\r\nthe mesoderm of the axial region of the body. This is particularly\r\nclearly seen in the case of the anterior part of the head of\r\nElasmobranch and probably of other vertebrate embryos, where all the\r\nmesoderm present is derived from the anterior part of the neural crest\r\n(_Quart. Journ. Mic. Science_, xxxvii. p. 92).\r\n\r\nThe layer-theory, then, will not bear critical examination. It is clear,\r\nboth from their origin and history, that the layers or masses of cells\r\ncalled ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm have not the same value in\r\ndifferent animals; indeed, it is misleading to speak of three layers. At\r\nthe most we can only speak of two, for the mesoderm is formed after the\r\nothers, has a composite origin, and has no more claim to be considered\r\nan embryonic layer than has the rudiment of the central nervous system,\r\nwhich in some animals, indeed, appears as soon as the mesoderm.\r\nArguments as to homology, based on derivation or non-derivation from the\r\nsame embryonic layer, have therefore in themselves but little value.\r\n\r\n  It has frequently been asserted that the reproductive cells are marked\r\n  off at a very early stage of the development (_Sagitta_, certain\r\n  Crustacea, _Scorpio_). Recently it has been asserted that in _Ascaris_\r\n  (T. Boveri, _Kuppfer's Festschrift_, 1899, p. 383) the reproductive\r\n  cells are set apart after the first cleavage, and that they can be\r\n  traced by certain peculiarities of their nuclei into the adult\r\n  reproductive glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mesenchyme.\r\n\r\n  It has been already stated that the mesoderm is a composite tissue.\r\n  This fact is frequently conspicuous at its first establishment. In\r\n  many Coelomata it is present under two forms from the beginning. One\r\n  of these is epithelial in character, while the other has the form of a\r\n  network of protoplasm, with nuclei at the nodes. The former is called\r\n  simply epithelial mesoderm, the latter mesenchyme. Sometimes the\r\n  epithelial mesoderm is the first formed, and what little mesenchyme\r\n  there is is developed from it (_Amphioxus, Balanoglossus_, &c.)\r\n  Sometimes the mesenchyme is the first to arise, the epithelial\r\n  mesoderm developing from it (most, if not all, Vertebrates). Finally,\r\n  it sometimes happens that these two kinds of tissue arise separately\r\n  from one or other of the primary layers (Echinodermata). As already\r\n  hinted, in _Balanoglossus_ and _Amphioxus_ the whole of the mesoderm\r\n  of the body is at first in an epithelial condition, being developed as\r\n  an outgrowth of the gut-wall. In _Peripatus capensis_ also, and\r\n  possibly in other Arthropods, it has at first an intermediate form,\r\n  being derived from a primitive streak and not from the gut-wall, but\r\n  it rapidly assumes an epithelial structure, from which all the\r\n  mesodermal tissues are developed. In Annelids the bulk of the mesoderm\r\n  has at first a modified epithelial form similar to that of Arthropods,\r\n  but it is formed, not from a primitive streak, but from some peculiar\r\n  cells produced in cleavage, called pole-cells. In Annelids with\r\n  trochosphere larvae a certain amount of mesenchyme is formed at an\r\n  earlier stage and gives rise to the muscular bands of the young\r\n  larva. In Echinodermata a certain amount of mesenchyme appears before\r\n  the epithelial mesoderm, which is formed later as gut-diverticula. In\r\n  these forms the mesenchyme is said to arise as wandering amoeboid\r\n  cells, which are budded into the blastocoel by the endoderm just\r\n  before and during its invagination, but the writer has reason to\r\n  believe that this account of it does not quite describe what happens.\r\n  It would seem to be more probable that the mesenchyme arises in these\r\n  forms, as it certainly does in the case of the later-formed mesenchyme\r\n  of the Vertebrate embryo, as a protoplasmic outflow from its tissue of\r\n  origin, passing at first along the line of pre-existent protoplasmic\r\n  strands which traverse the blastocoel, and sending out at the same\r\n  time processes which branch and anastomose with neighbouring processes\r\n  (see E.W. MacBride, _Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc._, 1896, p. 153). In the\r\n  Vertebrata the whole of the mesoderm has at first the mesenchyme form.\r\n  Afterwards, when the body-cavity split appears, the bulk of it assumes\r\n  a kind of modified epithelial condition, which later on yields, by a\r\n  process of outflow very similar in its character to what has been\r\n  supposed to occur in the Echinoderm blastula, a considerable\r\n  mesenchyme of the reticulate character. Mesenchyme is the tissue which\r\n  in Vertebrate embryology has frequently been called embryonic\r\n  connective tissue. This name is no doubt due to the fact that it was\r\n  supposed to consist of isolated stellate cells. It is, however, in no\r\n  sense of the word connective tissue, because it gives rise to many\r\n  organs having nothing whatever to do with connective tissue. For\r\n  instance, in Vertebrata this tissue gives rise to nervous tissue,\r\n  blood-vessels, renal tubules, smooth muscular fibres, and other\r\n  structures, as well as to connective and skeletal tissues. The\r\n  Vertebrata, indeed, are remarkable for the fact that the epithelial\r\n  tissues of the so-called mesoderm, e.g. the epithelial lining of the\r\n  body-cavity, and of the renal tubules and urogenital tracts, all pass\r\n  through the mesenchymatous condition, whereas in _Amphioxus_,\r\n  _Balanoglossus_ and presumably _Sagitta_ and the Brachiopoda, all the\r\n  mesodermal tissues pass through the epithelial condition, most of the\r\n  mesodermal tissues of the adult retaining this condition permanently.\r\n  As has been implied in the above account, mesenchyme is usually formed\r\n  from epithelial mesoderm or from endoderm, or from tissue destined to\r\n  form endoderm. It is also sometimes formed from ectoderm, as in the\r\n  Vertebrata at the nerve crest and other places. In some Coelenterata\r\n  also it appears certain that the ectoderm does furnish tissue of a\r\n  mesenchymatous nature which passes into the jelly, but this phenomenon\r\n  takes place comparatively late in life, at any rate after the\r\n  embryonic period. In this connexion it may be interesting to point out\r\n  that in many Coelenterates all the tissues of the body retain\r\n  throughout life the epithelial condition, nothing comparable to\r\n  mesenchyme ever being formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Continuity of the layers.\r\n\r\nFinally, before leaving this branch of the subject, the fact that the\r\nthree germinal layers are continuous with one another, and not isolated\r\nmasses of tissue, may be emphasized. Indeed, an embryo may be defined as\r\na multinucleated protoplasmic mass, in which the protoplasm at any\r\nsurface--whether internal or external--is in the form of a relatively\r\ndense layer, while that in the interior is much vacuolated and reduced\r\nto a more or less sparse reticulum, the nuclei either being exclusively\r\nfound in the surface protoplasm, or if the embryo has any bulk and the\r\ninternal reticulum is at all well developed, at the nodes of the\r\ninternal reticulum as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mouth and anus.\r\n\r\nThe origin of some of the more important organs may now be considered.\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the mouth and anus develop in the most\r\ndiverse ways in different groups, but as a rule either one or both of\r\nthem can be traced into relation with the blastopore, the history of\r\nwhich must therefore be examined. In most, if not all, the great groups\r\nof the animal kingdom, e.g. in Coelenterata, Annelida, Mollusca,\r\nVertebrata, and in Arthropoda, the blastopore or its representative is\r\nplaced on the neural surface of the body, and, as will be shown later\r\non, within the limits of the central nerve rudiment. Here it undergoes\r\nthe most diverse fate, even in members of the same group. For instance,\r\nin _Peripatus capensis_ it extends as a slit along the ventral surface,\r\nwhich closes up in the middle, but remains open at the two ends as the\r\npermanent mouth and anus. In other Arthropods, though full details have\r\nnot yet in all cases been worked out, the following general statement\r\nmay be made:--A blastopore (certain Crustacea) or its representative is\r\nformed on the neural surface of the embryo and always becomes closed,\r\nthe mouth and anus arising as independent perforations later. Here no\r\none would doubt the homology of the mouth and anus throughout the group;\r\nyet within the limits of a single genus--_Peripatus_--they show the most\r\ndiverse modes of development. In Annelids the blastopore sometimes\r\nbecomes the mouth (most Chaetopoda); sometimes it becomes the anus\r\n(_Serpula_); sometimes it closes up, giving rise to neither, though in\r\nthis case it may assume the form of a long slit along the ventral\r\nsurface before disappearing. In Mollusca its fate presents the same\r\nvariations as in Annelida. Now in these groups no zoologist would deny\r\nthe homology of the mouth and anus in the different forms, and yet how\r\nvery different is their history even in closely allied animals. How are\r\nthese apparently diverse facts to be reconciled? The only satisfactory\r\nexplanation which has been offered (Sedgwick, _Quart. J. Mic. Science_,\r\nxxiv., 1884, p. 43) is that the blastopore is homologous in all the\r\ngroups mentioned, and is the representative of the original single\r\nopening into the enteric cavity, such as at present characterizes the\r\nCoelenterata. From it the mouth and anus have been derived, as is\r\nindicated by its history in _Peripatus capensis_, and by the variability\r\nin its behaviour in closely allied forms; such variability in its\r\nsubsequent history is due to its specialization as a larval organ, as a\r\nresult of which it has lost its capacity to give rise to both mouth and\r\nanus, and sometimes to either.\r\n\r\n  That the blastopore does become specialized as a larval organ is\r\n  obvious in those cases in which it becomes transformed into the single\r\n  opening with which some larvae are, for a time at least, alone\r\n  provided, e.g. _Pilidium_, Echinoderm larvae, &c., and that larval\r\n  characters have been the principal causes of the form of embryonic\r\n  characters, strong reason to believe will be adduced later on. In the\r\n  Vertebrata the behaviour of the blastopore (anus of Rusconi) is also\r\n  variable in a very remarkable manner. As a rule it is slit-like in\r\n  form and closes completely, but in most cases one portion of it\r\n  remains open longer than the rest, as the neurenteric canal. In a few\r\n  forms (e.g. Newt, _Lepidosiren_, &c.) the very hindermost portion of\r\n  the slit-like blastopore remains permanently open as the anus, and\r\n  from such cases it can be shown that the neurenteric aperture (when\r\n  present) is derived from a portion of the blastopore just anterior to\r\n  its hindermost end. The words \"hindermost\" and \"anterior\" are used on\r\n  the assumption that the whole blastopore has retained its dorsal\r\n  position; as a matter of fact the hindermost part of it--the part\r\n  which persists or reopens as the anus--loses this position in the\r\n  course of development and becomes shifted on to the ventral surface.\r\n  This is clearly seen in _Lepidosiren_ (Kerr, _Phil. Trans._ cxcii.,\r\n  1900), in Elasmobranchii, and in Amniota (primitive streak). Moreover,\r\n  in _Lepidosiren_, and possibly in some other forms, the anus, i.e. the\r\n  hind end of the blastopore, is at first contained within the medullary\r\n  plate and bounded behind by the medullary folds. Later the portions of\r\n  the medullary plate in the neighbourhood of the anus completely\r\n  atrophy, and this relation is lost. This extension of the hind end of\r\n  the blastopore on to the ventral surface, and atrophy of the portion\r\n  of the medullary plate in relation with it, is a highly important\r\n  phenomenon, and one to which attention will be again called when the\r\n  relation of the mouth to the blastopore is being considered. The\r\n  remarkable fact about the Vertebrata, a feature which that group\r\n  shares in common with all other Chordata (_Amphioxus_, Tunicata,\r\n  Enteropneusta) and with the Echinodermata, is that the mouth has never\r\n  been traced into relation with the blastopore. For this reason, among\r\n  others, it has been held by some zoologists that the mouth of the\r\n  Vertebrata is not homologous with the mouth of such groups as the\r\n  Annelida, Arthropoda and Mollusca. But, as has been explained above,\r\n  in face of the extraordinary variability in the history of the mouth\r\n  and anus in these groups, this view cannot be regarded as in any way\r\n  established. On the contrary, there are distinct reasons for thinking\r\n  that the Vertebrate mouth is a derivate of the blastopore. In the\r\n  first place, in Elasmobranchii (Sedgwick, _Quart. Journ. Mic. Sci._\r\n  xxxiii., 1892, p. 559), and in a less conspicuous form in other\r\n  vertebrate groups, the mouth has at first a slit-like form, extending\r\n  from the anterior end of the central nerve-tube backwards along the\r\n  ventral surface of the anterior part of the embryo. This slit-like\r\n  rudiment, recalling as it does the form which the blastopore assumes\r\n  in so many groups and in many Vertebrata, does suggest the view that\r\n  possibly the mouth of the Vertebrata may in reality be derived from a\r\n  portion of an originally long slit-like neural blastopore, which has\r\n  become extended anteriorly on to the ventral surface and has lost its\r\n  original relation to the nerve rudiment, as has undoubtedly happened\r\n  with the posterior part, which persists as the anus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Central nervous system.\r\n\r\nOf the other organs which develop from the two primary layers it is only\r\npossible to notice here the central nervous system. This in almost all\r\nanimals develops from the ectoderm. In Cephalopods among Mollusca--the\r\ndevelopment of which is remarkable from the almost complete absence of\r\nfeatures which are supposed to have an ancestral significance--and in\r\none or two other forms, it has been said to develop from the mesoderm;\r\nbut apart from these exceptional and perhaps doubtful cases, the\r\ncentral nervous system of all embryos arises as thickenings of the\r\nectoderm, and in the groups above mentioned, namely, Annelida, Mollusca,\r\nArthropoda and Vertebrata, and probably others, from the ectoderm of the\r\nblastoporal surface of the body. This surface generally becomes the\r\nventral surface, but in Vertebrata it becomes the dorsal. These\r\nthickened tracts of ectoderm in _Peripatus_ and a few other forms can be\r\nclearly seen to surround the blastopore. This relation is retained in\r\nthe adult in _Peripatus_, some Mollusca and some Nemertines, in which\r\nthe main lateral nerve cords are united behind the anus as well as in\r\nfront of the mouth; in other forms it cannot always be demonstrated, but\r\nit can, as in the case of the Vertebrata just referred to, always be\r\ninferred; only, in the Invertebrate groups the part of the nerve\r\nrudiment which has to be inferred is the posterior part behind the\r\nblastopore, whereas in Vertebrata it is the anterior part, namely, that\r\nin front of the blastopore, assuming that the mouth is a blastoporal\r\nderivate.\r\n\r\n  In the Echinodermata, Enteropneusta and one or two other groups, it is\r\n  not possible, in the present state of knowledge, to bring the mouth\r\n  into relation with the blastopore, nor can the blastopore be shown to\r\n  be a perforation of the neural surface. For the Echinoderms, at any\r\n  rate, this fact loses some of the importance which might at first\r\n  sight be attributed to it when the remarkable organization of the\r\n  adult and the sharp contrast which exists between it and the larva is\r\n  remembered. In some Annelids the central nervous system remains\r\n  throughout life as part of the outer epidermis, but as a general rule\r\n  it becomes separated from the epidermis and embedded in the mesodermal\r\n  tissues. The mode in which this separation is effected varies\r\n  according to the form and structure of the central nervous system. In\r\n  the Vertebrata, in which this organ has the form of a tube extending\r\n  along the dorsal surface of the body, it arises as a groove of the\r\n  medullary plate, which becomes constricted into a canal. The wall of\r\n  this canal consists of ectoderm, which at an earlier stage formed part\r\n  of the outer surface of the body, but which after invagination\r\n  thickens, to give rise to the epithelial lining of the canal and to\r\n  the nervous tissue which forms the bulk of the canal wall. The fact\r\n  that the blastopore remains open at the hind end of the medullary\r\n  plate explains to a certain extent the peculiar relation which always\r\n  exists in the embryo between the hind end of the neural and alimentary\r\n  canals. This communication between the hind end of the neural tube and\r\n  the gut is one of the most remarkable and constant features of the\r\n  Vertebrate embryo. As has been pointed out, it is not altogether\r\n  unintelligible when we remember the relation of the blastopore to the\r\n  medullary plate of the earlier stage, but to give a complete\r\n  explanation of it is, and probably always will be, impossible. It is\r\n  no doubt the impress of some remarkable larval condition of the\r\n  blastopore of a stage of evolution now long past.\r\n\r\n  In _Ceratodus_ the open part of the blastopore is enclosed by the\r\n  medullary folds, as in _Lepidosiren_, and probably persists as the\r\n  anus, the portion of the folds around the anus undergoing atrophy\r\n  (Semon, _Zool. Forschungsreisen in Australien_, 1893, Bd. i. p. 39).\r\n  In Urodeles the blastopore persists as anus, so far as is known, but\r\n  the relation to the medullary folds has not been noticed. The same may\r\n  be said of _Petromyzon_ (A.E. Shipley, _Quart. Journ. Mic. Sci._\r\n  xxviii., 1887).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cranial flexure.\r\n\r\n  The nerve tube of the Vertebrata at a certain early stage of the\r\n  embryo becomes bent ventralwards in its anterior portion, in such a\r\n  manner that the anterior end, which is represented in the adult by the\r\n  infundibulum, comes to project backwards beneath the mid-brain. This\r\n  bend, which is called the cranial flexure, takes place through the\r\n  mid-brain, so that the hind-brain is unaffected by it. The cranial\r\n  flexure is not, however, confined to the brain: the anterior end of\r\n  the notochord, which at first extends almost to the front end of the\r\n  nerve tube (this extension, which is quite obvious in the young embryo\r\n  of Elasmobranchs, becomes masked in the later stages by the\r\n  extraordinary modifications which the parts undergo), is also affected\r\n  by it. Moreover, it affects even other parts, as may be seen by the\r\n  oblique, almost antero-posterior, direction of the anterior gill slits\r\n  as compared with the transverse direction of those behind. No\r\n  satisfactory explanation has ever been offered of the cranial flexure.\r\n  It is found in all Vertebrates, and is effected at an early stage of\r\n  the development. In the later stages and in the adult it ceases to be\r\n  noticeable, on account of an alteration of the relative sizes of parts\r\n  of the brain. This is due almost entirely to the enormous growth of\r\n  the cerebral vesicle, which is an outgrowth of the dorsal wall of the\r\n  fore-brain just short of its anterior end. The anterior end of the\r\n  fore-brain remains relatively small throughout life as the\r\n  infundibulum, and the junction of this part of the fore-brain with the\r\n  part which is so largely developed, as the rudiment of the cerebrum,\r\n  is marked by the attachment of the optic chiasma. The optic nerve,\r\n  indeed, is morphologically the first cranial nerve, the olfactory\r\n  being the second; both are attached to what is morphologically the\r\n  dorsal side of the nerve tube. The morphological anterior end of the\r\n  central nerve tube is the point of the infundibulum which is in\r\n  contact with the pituitary body. While on the subject of the cranial\r\n  flexure, it may be pointed out that there is a similar downward curve\r\n  of the hind end of the nervous axis, which leads into the hind end of\r\n  the enteron. If it be supposed that originally there was a\r\n  communication between the infundibulum and pituitary body, then the\r\n  ventral flexure found at both ends of the nerve axis would originally\r\n  have had the same result, namely, of placing the neural and alimentary\r\n  canals in communication. Moreover, the mouth would have had much the\r\n  same relation to this imaginary anterior neurenteric canal that the\r\n  anus has to the actual posterior one.\r\n\r\n  In _Amphioxus_ and the Tunicata the early development of the central\r\n  nervous system is very much like that of the Vertebrata, but the later\r\n  stages are simpler, being without the cranial flexure. The Tunicata\r\n  are remarkable for the fact that the nervous system, though at first\r\n  hollow, becomes quite solid in the adult. In _Balanoglossus_ the\r\n  central nervous system is in part tubular, the canal being open at\r\n  each end. It arises, however, by delamination from the ectoderm, the\r\n  tube being a secondary acquisition. This is probably due to a\r\n  shortening of development, for the same feature is found in some\r\n  Vertebrata (Teleostei, _Lepidosteus_, &c.), where the central canal is\r\n  secondarily hollowed out in the solid keel-like mass which is\r\n  separated from the ectoderm. Parts of the central nervous system arise\r\n  by invagination in other groups; for instance, the cerebral ganglia of\r\n  _Dentalium_ are formed from the walls of two invaginations of\r\n  ectoderm, which eventually disappear at the anterior end of the body\r\n  (A. Kowalevsky, _Ann. Mus. Hist. Nat. Marseilles_, \"Zoology,\" vol.\r\n  i.). In _Peripatus_ the cerebral ganglia arise in a similar way, but\r\n  in this case the cavities of the invagination become separated from\r\n  the skin and persist as two hollow appendages on the lower side of the\r\n  cerebral ganglia. In other Arthropods the cerebral ganglia arise in a\r\n  similar way, but the invaginations disappear in the adult. In\r\n  Nemertines the cerebral ganglia contain a cavity which communicates\r\n  with the exterior by a narrow canal. Finally, in certain Echinodermata\r\n  the ventral part of the central nervous system arises by the\r\n  invagination of a linear streak of ectoderm, the cavity of the\r\n  invagination persisting as the epineural canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Peripheral nervous system.\r\n\r\nAlthough the central nervous system is almost always developed from the\r\nectoderm of the embryo, the same cannot be said of the peripheral nerve\r\ntrunks. These structures arise from the mesoblastic reticulum already\r\ndescribed (Sedgwick, _Quart. Journ. Mic. Sci._ xxxvii. 92). Inasmuch as\r\nthis reticulum is perfectly continuous with the precisely similar though\r\ndenser tissue in the ectoderm and endoderm, it may well be that a\r\nportion of the nerve trunks should be described as being ectodermal and\r\nendodermal in origin, though the bulk of them are undoubtedly formed\r\nfrom that portion of the reticulum commonly described as mesoblastic.\r\nBut, however that may be, the tissue from which the great nerve trunks\r\nare developed is continuous on all sides with a similar tissue which\r\npervades all the organs of the body, and in which the nuclei of these\r\norgans are contained.\r\n\r\n  In the early stages of development this tissue is very sparse and not\r\n  easily seen. It would appear, indeed, that it is of a very delicate\r\n  texture and readily destroyed by reagents. It is for this reason that\r\n  the layers of the Vertebrate embryo are commonly represented as being\r\n  quite isolated from one another, and that the medullary canal is\r\n  nearly always represented as being completely isolated at certain\r\n  stages from the surrounding tissues. In reality the layers are all\r\n  connected together by this delicate tissue--in a sparse form, it is\r\n  true--which not only extends between them, but also in a denser and\r\n  more distinct form pervades them. In the germinal layers themselves,\r\n  and in the organs developing from them, this tissue is in the young\r\n  stages almost entirely obscured by the densely packed nuclei which it\r\n  contains. For instance, in the wall of the medullary canal in the\r\n  Vertebrate embryo, in the splanchnic and somatic layers of mesoderm of\r\n  the same embryo, and in the developing nerve cords of the _Peripatus_\r\n  embryo, the nuclei are at first so densely crowded together that it is\r\n  almost impossible to see the protoplasmic framework in which they\r\n  rest, but as development proceeds this extra-nuclear tissue becomes\r\n  more largely developed, and the nuclei are forced apart, so that it\r\n  becomes visible and receives various names according to its position.\r\n  In the wall of the medullary canal of the Vertebrate embryo, on the\r\n  outside of which it becomes especially conspicuous in certain places,\r\n  and on the dorsal side of the developing nerve cords of the\r\n  _Peripatus_ embryo, it constitutes the white matter of the developing\r\n  nerve cord; in the mesoblastic tissue outside, where it at the same\r\n  time becomes more conspicuous (Sedgwick, \"Monograph of the Development\r\n  of _Peripatus capensis_,\" _Studies from the Morph. Lab. of the\r\n  University of Cambridge_, iv., 1889, p. 131), it forms the looser\r\n  network of the mesoblastic reticulum; and connecting the two, in place\r\n  of the few and delicate strands of this tissue of the former stage,\r\n  there are at certain places well-marked cords of a relatively dense\r\n  texture, with the meshes of the reticulum elongated in the direction\r\n  of the cord. This latter structure is an incipient nerve trunk. It can\r\n  be traced outwards into the mesoblastic reticulum, from the strands of\r\n  which it is indeed developed, and with which it is continuous not only\r\n  at its free end, but also along its whole course. In this way the\r\n  nerve trunks are developed--by a gathering up, so to speak, of the\r\n  fibres of the reticulum into bundles. These bundles are generally\r\n  marked by the possession of nuclei, especially in their cortical\r\n  parts, which become no doubt the nuclei of the nerve sheath, and, in\r\n  the neighbourhood of the ganglia, of nerve cells. From this account of\r\n  the early development of the nerves, it is apparent that they are in\r\n  their origin continuous with all the other tissues of the body, with\r\n  that of the central nervous system and with that which becomes\r\n  transformed into muscular tissue and connective and epithelial\r\n  tissues. All these tissues are developed from the general reticulum,\r\n  which in the young embryo can be seen to pervade the whole body, not\r\n  being confined to the mesoderm, but extending between the nuclei of\r\n  the ectoderm and endoderm, and forming the extra-nuclear, so-called\r\n  cellular, protoplasm of those layers. Moreover, it must be remarked\r\n  that in the stages of the embryo with which we are here concerned the\r\n  so-called cellular constitution of the tissues, which is such a marked\r\n  feature of the older embryo and adult, has not been arrived at. It is\r\n  true, indications of it may be seen in some of the earlier-formed\r\n  epithelia, but of nerve cells, muscular cells, and many kinds of gland\r\n  cells no distinct signs are yet visible. This remark particularly\r\n  applies to nerve cells, which do not make their appearance until a\r\n  much later stage--not, indeed, until some time after the principal\r\n  nerve trunks and ganglia are indicated as tracts of pale fibrous\r\n  substance and aggregations of nuclei respectively.\r\n\r\n  The embryos of Elasmobranchs--particularly of _Scyllium_--are the best\r\n  objects in which to study the development of nerves. In many embryos\r\n  it is difficult to make out what happens, because the various parts of\r\n  the body remain so close together that the process is obscured, and\r\n  the loosening of the mesoblastic nuclei is deferred until after the\r\n  nerves have begun to be differentiated. The process may also be traced\r\n  in the embryos of _Peripatus_, where the main features are essentially\r\n  similar to those above described (op. cit. p. 131). The development of\r\n  the motor nerves has been worked out in _Lepidosiren_ by J. Graham\r\n  Kerr (_Trans. Roy. Soc. of Edinburgh_, 41, 1904. p. 119).\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the development of nerves is not, as has been recently urged,\r\nan outgrowth of cell processes from certain cells, but is a\r\ndifferentiation of a substance which was already in position, and from\r\nwhich all other organs of the body have been and are developed. It\r\nfrequently happens that the young nerve tracts can be seen sooner near\r\nthe central organ than elsewhere, but it is doubtful if any importance\r\ncan be attached to this fact, since it is not constantly observed. For\r\ninstance, in the case of the third nerve of _Scyllium_ the\r\ndifferentiation appears to take place earliest near the ciliary\r\nganglion, and to proceed from that point to the base of the mid-brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Coelom.\r\n\r\nThere are two main methods in which new organs are developed. In the\r\none, which indicates the possibility of physiological continuity, the\r\norgan arises by the direct modification of a portion of a pre-existing\r\norgan; the development of the central nervous system of the Vertebrata\r\nfrom a groove in the embryonic ectoderm may be taken as an example of\r\nthis method. In the other method there is no continuity which can be in\r\nany way interpreted as physiological; a centre of growth appears in one\r\nof the parts of the embryo, and gives rise to a mass of tissue which\r\ngradually shapes itself into the required organ. The development of the\r\ncentral nervous system in Teleosteans and in other similar exceptional\r\ncases may be mentioned as an example of the second plan. Such a centre\r\nof growth is frequently called a blastema, and consists of a mass of\r\nclosely packed nuclei which have arisen by the growth-activity of the\r\nnuclei in the neighbourhood. The coelom, an organ which is found in the\r\nso-called coelomate animals, and which in the adult is usually divided\r\nup more or less completely into three parts, namely, body-cavity, renal\r\norgans, generative glands, presents in different animals both these\r\nmethods of development. In certain animals it develops by the direct\r\nmodification of a part of the primitive enteron, while in others it\r\narises by the gradual shaping of a mass of tissue which consists of a\r\ncompact mass of nuclei derived by nuclear proliferation from one or more\r\nof the pre-existing tissues of the body. Inasmuch as the first rudiment\r\nof the coelom nearly always makes its appearance at an early stage, when\r\nthe ectoderm and endoderm are almost the only tissues present, and as it\r\nthen bulks relatively very large and frequently contains within itself\r\nthe potential centres of growth of other organs, e.g. mesenchymal organs\r\n(see above), it has come to be regarded by embryologists as being the\r\nforerunner of all the so-called mesodermal organs of the body, and has\r\nbeen dignified with the somewhat mysterious rank which attaches to the\r\nconception of a germinal layer. Its prominence and importance at an\r\nearly stage led embryologists, as has already been explained, to\r\noverlook the fact that although some of the centres of growth for the\r\nformation of other non-coelomic mesodermal organs and tissues may be\r\ncontained within it, all are not so contained, and that there are\r\ncentres of mesodermal growth still left in the ectoderm and endoderm\r\nafter its establishment. If these considerations, and others like them,\r\nare correct, it would seem to follow that the conception implied by the\r\nword mesoderm has no objective existence, that the tissue of the embryo\r\ncalled mesoderm, though sometimes mainly the rudiment of the coelom, is\r\noften much more than this, and contains within itself the rudiment of\r\nmany, sometimes of all, of the organs appertaining to the mesenchyme. In\r\nthus containing within itself the potential centres of growth of other\r\norgans and tissues which are commonly ranked as mesodermal, it is not\r\ndifferent from the rudiments of the two other organs already formed,\r\nnamely, the ectoderm and endoderm; for these contain within themselves\r\ncentres of growth for the production of so-called mesodermal tissues, as\r\nwitness the nerve-crest of Vertebrata, the growing-point of the\r\npronephric duct, and the formation of blood-vessels from the hypoblast\r\ndescribed for some members of the same group.\r\n\r\nIn Echinodermata, _Amphioxus_, Enteropneusta, and a few other groups,\r\nthe coelom develops from a portion or portions of the primitive enteron,\r\nwhich eventually becomes separated from the rest and forms a variable\r\nnumber of closed sacs lying between the gut and the ectoderm. The number\r\nof these sacs varies in different animals, but the evidence at present\r\navailable seems to show that the maximum number is five--an unpaired one\r\nin front and two pairs behind--and, further, that if a less number of\r\nsacs is actually separated from the enteron, the rule is for these sacs\r\nso to divide up that they give rise to five sacs arranged in the manner\r\nindicated. The Enteropneusta present us with the clearest case of the\r\nseparation of five sacs from the primitive enteron (W. Bateson, _Quart.\r\nJourn. Mic. Sci._ xxiv., 1884). In _Amphioxus_, according to the\r\nimportant researches of E.W. MacBride (_Quart. Journ. Mic. Sci._ xl.\r\n589), it appears that a similar process occurs, though it is complicated\r\nby the fact that the sacs of the posterior pair become divided up at an\r\nearly stage into many pairs. In _Phoronis_ there are indications of the\r\nsame phenomenon (A.T. Masterman, _Quart. Journ. Mic. Sci._ xliii. 375).\r\nIn the Chaetognatha a single sac only is separated from the enteron, but\r\nsoon becomes divided up. In the Brachiopoda one pair of sacs is\r\nseparated from the enteron, but our knowledge of their later history is\r\nnot sufficient to enable us to say whether they divide up into the\r\ntypically arranged five sacs. In Echinodermata the number of sacs\r\nseparated from the enteron varies from one to three; but though the\r\nhistory of these shows considerable differences, there are reasons to\r\nbelieve that the typical final arrangement is one unpaired and two\r\npaired sacs. But however many sacs may arise from the primitive enteron,\r\nand however these sacs may ultimately divide up and arrange themselves,\r\nthe important point of development common to all these animals, about\r\nwhich there can be no dispute, is that the coelom is a direct\r\ndifferentiation of a portion of the enteron.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of the Coelomata the coelomic rudiment does not arise by\r\nthe simple differentiation of a pre-existing organ, and there is\r\nconsiderable variation in its method of formation. Speaking generally,\r\nit may be said to arise by the differentiation of a blastema (see\r\nabove), which develops at an early stage as a nuclear proliferation from\r\none or more growth-centres in one or both of the primary layers. It\r\nappears in this tissue as a sac or as a series of sacs, which become\r\ntransformed into the body-cavity (except in the Arthropoda), into the\r\nrenal organs (with the possible exception, again, of some Arthropoda),\r\nand into the reproductive glands. In metamerically segmented animals the\r\nappearance of the cavities of these sacs is synchronous with, and\r\nindeed determines, the appearance of metameric segmentation. In all\r\nsegmented animals in which the mesoderm (coelomic rudiment) appears as a\r\ncontinuous sheet or band of tissue on each side of the body, the\r\ncoelomic cavity makes its first appearance not as a continuous space on\r\neach side, which later becomes divided up into the structures called\r\nmesoblastic somites, but as a series of paired spaces round which the\r\ncoelomic tissue arranges itself in an epithelial manner. In the\r\nVertebrata, it is true, the ventral portion of the coelom appears at\r\nfirst as a continuous space, at any rate behind the region of the two\r\nanterior pairs of somites, but in the dorsal portion the coelomic cavity\r\nis developed in the usual way, the coelomic tissue becoming transformed\r\ninto the muscle plates and rudimentary renal tubules of the later\r\nstages. With regard to this ventral portion of the coelom in Vertebrata,\r\nit is to be noticed that the cavity in it never becomes divided up, but\r\nalways remains continuous, forming the perivisceral portion of the\r\ncoelom. The probable explanation of this peculiarity in the development\r\nof the Vertebrate coelom, as compared with that of _Amphioxus_ and other\r\nsegmented animals, is that the segmented stage of the ventral portion of\r\nthe coelom is omitted. This explanation derives some support from the\r\nfact that even in animals in which the coelom is at its first appearance\r\nwholly segmented, it frequently happens that in the adult the\r\nperivisceral portion of it is unsegmented, i.e. it loses during\r\ndevelopment the segmentation which it at first possesses. This happens\r\nin many Annelida and in _Amphioxus_. The lesson, then, which the early\r\nhistory of the coelom in segmented animals teaches is, that however the\r\ncoelomic cavity first makes its appearance, whether by evaginations from\r\nthe primitive enteron, or by the hollowing out of a solid blastema-like\r\ntissue which has developed from one or both of the primary layers, it is\r\nin its first origin segmented, and forms the basis on which the segments\r\nof the adult are moulded. In Arthropoda the origin of the coelom is\r\nsimilar to that of Annelids, but its history is not completely known in\r\nany group, with the exception of _Peripatus_. In this genus it develops\r\nno perivisceral portion, as in other groups, but gives rise solely to\r\nthe nephridia and to the reproductive organs. It is probable, though not\r\ncertainly proved, that the history of the coelom in other Arthropods is\r\nessentially similar to that of _Peripatus_, allowance being made for the\r\nfact that the nephridial portion does not attain full development in\r\nthose forms which are without nephridia in the adult.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the development of the vascular system, little can be\r\nsaid here, except that it appears to arise from the spaces of the\r\nmesoblastic reticulum. When this reticulum is sparse or so delicate as\r\nto give way in manipulation, these spaces appear to be represented by a\r\ncontinuous space which in the earliest stages of development is\r\nfrequently spoken of as the blastocoel or segmentation cavity. They\r\nacquire special epithelial walls, and form the main trunks and network\r\nof smaller vessels found in animals with a canalicular vascular system,\r\nor the large sinus-like spaces characteristic of animals with a\r\nhaemocoelic body-cavity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transient embryonic organs.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a phase at the beginning of life during which a young\r\nanimal acquires its equipment by a process of growth of the germ is of\r\ncourse intelligible enough; such a phase is seen in the formation of\r\nbuds, and in the sexual reproduction of both animals and plants. The\r\nremarkable point is that while in most cases this embryonic growth is a\r\ndirect and simple process--e.g. animal and plant buds, embryonic\r\ndevelopment of plant seeds--in many cases of sexual reproduction of\r\nanimals it is not direct, and the embryonic phase shows stages of\r\nstructure which seem to possess a meaning other than that of being\r\nmerely phases of growth. The fact that these stages of structure through\r\nwhich the embryo passes sometimes present for a short time features\r\nwhich are permanent in other members of the same group, adds very\r\nlargely to the interest of the phenomenon and necessitates its careful\r\nexamination. This may be divided into two heads: (1) in relation to\r\nembryos, (2) in relation to larvae. So far as embryos are concerned, we\r\nshall limit ourselves mainly to a consideration of the Vertebrata,\r\nbecause in them are found most instances of that remarkable phenomenon,\r\nthe temporary assumption by certain organs of the embryo of stages of\r\nstructure which are permanent in other members of the same group. As is\r\nwell known, the embryos of the higher Vertebrata possess in the\r\nstructure of the pharynx and of the heart and vascular system certain\r\nfeatures--namely, paired pharyngeal apertures, a simple tubular heart,\r\nand a single ventral aorta giving off right and left a number of\r\nbranches which pass between the pharyngeal apertures--which permanently\r\ncharacterize those organs in fishes. The skeleton, largely bony in the\r\nadult, passes through a stage in which it is entirely without bone, and\r\nconsists mainly of cartilage--the form which it permanently possesses in\r\ncertain fishes. Further, the Vertebrate embryo possesses for a time a\r\nnotochord, a segmented muscular system, a continuity between the\r\npericardium and the posterior part of the perivisceral cavity--all\r\nfeatures which characterize certain groups of Pisces in the adult state.\r\nInstances of this kind might be multiplied, for the work of anatomists\r\nand embryologists has of late years been largely devoted to adding to\r\nthem. Examples of embryonic characters which are not found in the adults\r\nof other Vertebrates are the following:--At a certain stage of\r\ndevelopment the central nervous system has the form of a groove in the\r\nskin, there is a communication at the hind end of the body between the\r\nneural and alimentary canals, the mouth aperture has at first the form\r\nof an elongated slit, the growing end of the Wolffian duct is in some\r\ngroups continuous with the ectoderm, and the retina is at one stage a\r\nportion of the wall of the medullary canal. In the embryos of the lower\r\nVertebrates many other instances of the same interesting character might\r\nbe mentioned; for instance, the presence of a coelomic sac close to the\r\neye, of another in the jaw, and of a third near the ear (Elasmobranchs),\r\nthe opening of the Mullerian duct into the front end of the Wolffian\r\nduct, and the presence of an aperture of communication between the\r\nmuscle-plate coelom and the nephridial coelom.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Recapitulation theory.\r\n\r\nThe interest attaching to these remarkable facts is much increased by\r\nthe explanation which has been given of them. That explanation, which is\r\na deduction from the theory of evolution, is to the effect that the\r\npeculiar embryonic structures and relations just mentioned are due to\r\nthe retention by the embryo of features which, once possessed by the\r\nadult ancestor, have been lost in the course of evolution. This\r\nexplanation, which at once suggests itself when we are dealing with\r\nstructures actually present in adult members of other groups, does not\r\nso obviously apply to those features which are found in no adult animal\r\nwhatsoever. Nevertheless it has been extended to them, because they are\r\nof a nature which it is not impossible to suppose might have existed in\r\na working animal. Now this explanation, which, it will be observed, can\r\nonly be entertained on the assumption that the evolution theory is true,\r\nhas been still further extended by embryologists in a remarkable and\r\nfrequently unjustifiable manner, and has been applied to all embryonic\r\nprocesses, finally leading to the so-called recapitulation theory, which\r\nasserts that embryonic history is a shortened recapitulation of\r\nancestral history, or, to use the language of modern zoology, that the\r\n_ontogeny_ or development of the individual contains an abbreviated\r\nrecord of the _phylogeny_ or development of the race. A theory so\r\nimportant and far-reaching as this requires very careful examination.\r\nWhen we come to look for the facts upon which it is based, we find that\r\nthey are non-existent, for the ancestors of all living animals are dead,\r\nand we have no means of knowing what they were like. It is true there\r\nare fossil remains of animals which have lived, but these are so\r\nimperfect as to be practically useless for the present requirements.\r\nMoreover, if they were perfectly preserved, there would be no evidence\r\nto show that they were ancestors of the animals now living. They might\r\nhave been animals which have become extinct and left no descendants.\r\nThus the explanation ordinarily given of the embryonic structures\r\nreferred to is purely a deduction from the evolution theory. Indeed, it\r\nis even less than this, for all that can be said is something of this\r\nkind: if the evolution theory is true, then it in conceivable that the\r\nreason why the embryo of a bird passes through a stage in which its\r\npharynx presents some resemblance to that of a fish is that a remote\r\nancestor of the bird possessed a pharynx with lateral apertures such as\r\nare at present found in fishes.\r\n\r\nBut the explanation is sometimes pushed even further, and it is said\r\nthat these pharyngeal apertures of the ancestral bird had the same\r\nrespiratory function as the corresponding structures in modern fishes.\r\nThat this is going too far a little reflection will show. For if it be\r\nadmitted that all so-called vestigial structures had once the same\r\nfunction as the homologous structures when fully developed in other\r\nanimals, it becomes necessary to admit that male mammals must once have\r\nhad fully developed mammary glands and suckled the young, that female\r\nmammals formerly were provided with a functional penis, and that in\r\nspecies in which the females have a trace of the secondary sexual\r\ncharacters of the male the latter were once common to both sexes. The\r\nsecond and more extended form of the explanation plainly introduces a\r\nconsiderable amount of contentious matter, and it will be advisable, in\r\nthe first instance, at any rate, to confine ourselves to a critical\r\nexamination of the less ambitious conception. This explanation obviously\r\nimplies the view that in the course of evolution the tendency has been\r\nfor structures to persist in the embryo after they have been lost in the\r\nadult. Is there any justification for this view? It is clearly\r\nimpossible to get any direct evidence, because, as explained above, we\r\nhave no knowledge of the ancestors of living animals; but if we assume\r\nthe evolution theory to be true, there is a certain amount of indirect\r\nevidence which is distinctly opposed to the view. As is well known,\r\nliving birds are without teeth, but it is generally assumed that their\r\nedentulous condition has been comparatively recently acquired, and that\r\nthey are descended from animals which, at a time not very remote from\r\nthe present, possessed teeth. Considering the resemblance of birds to\r\nother terrestrial vertebrates, and the fact that extinct birds, not\r\ngreatly differing from birds now living, are known to have had teeth, it\r\nmust be allowed that there is some warrant for the assumption. Yet in no\r\nsingle case has it been certainly shown that any trace of teeth has been\r\ndeveloped in the embryo. The same remark applies to a large number of\r\nsimilar cases; for instance, the reduced digits of the bird's hand and\r\nfoot and the limbs of snakes. Moreover, organs which are supposed to\r\nhave become recently reduced and functionless in the adult are also\r\nreduced in the embryo; for instance, digits 3 and 4 of the horse's foot,\r\nthe hind limbs of whales (G.A. Guldberg and F. Nansen, \"On the\r\nDevelopment and Structure of Whales,\" _Bergen Museum_, 1894), the\r\nspiracle of Elasmobranchii. In fact, considerations of this kind\r\ndistinctly point to the view that any tendency to the reduction or\r\nenlargement of an organ in the adult is shared approximately to the same\r\nextent by the embryo. But there are undoubtedly some, though not many,\r\ncases in which organs which were presumably present in an ancestral\r\nadult have persisted in the embryo of the modern form. As an instance\r\nmay be mentioned the presence in whale-bone whales of imperfectly formed\r\nteeth, which are absorbed comparatively early in foetal life (Julin,\r\n_Arch. biologie_, i., 1880, p. 75).\r\n\r\nIt therefore becomes necessary to inquire why in some cases an organ is\r\nretained by the embryo after its loss by the adult, whereas in other\r\ncases it dwindles and presumably disappears simultaneously in the embryo\r\nand the adult. The whole question is examined and discussed by the\r\npresent writer in the _Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science_,\r\nxxxvi., 1894, p. 35, and the conclusions there reached are as\r\nfollows:--A disappearing adult organ is not retained in a relatively\r\ngreater development by an organism in the earlier stages of its\r\nindividual growth unless it is of functional importance to the young\r\nform. In cases in which the whole development is embryonic this rarely\r\nhappens, because the conditions of embryonic life are so different from\r\nfree life that functional embryonic organs are usually organs _sui\r\ngeneris, e.g._ the placenta, amnion, &c., which cannot be traced to a\r\nmodification of organs previously present in the adult. It does,\r\nhowever, appear to have happened sometimes, and as an instance of it\r\nmay be mentioned the _ductus arteriosus_ of the Sauropsidan and\r\nMammalian embryo. On the other hand, when there is a considerable period\r\nof larval life, it does appear that there is a strong case for thinking\r\nthat organs which have been lost by the adult may be retained and made\r\nuse of by the larva. The best-known example that can be given of this is\r\nthe tadpole of the frog. Here we find organs, viz. gills and gill-slits,\r\nwhich are universally regarded as having been attributes of all\r\nterrestrial Vertebrata in an earlier and aquatic condition, and we also\r\nnotice that their retention is due to their being useful on account of\r\nthe supposed ancient conditions of life having been retained. Many other\r\ninstances, more or less plausible, of a like retention of ancestral\r\nfeatures by larvae might be mentioned, and it must be conceded that\r\nthere are strong reasons for supposing that larvae often retain traces,\r\nmore or less complete, of ancestral stages of structure. But this\r\nadmission does not carry with it any obligation to accept the widely\r\nprevalent view that larval history can in any way be regarded as a\r\nrecapitulation of ancestral history. Far from it, for larvae in\r\nretaining some ancestral features are in no way different from adults;\r\nthey only differ from adults in the features which they have retained.\r\nBoth larvae and adults retain ancestral features, and both have been\r\nmodified by an adaptation to their respective conditions of life which\r\nhas ever been becoming more perfect.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion, then, has been reached, that whereas larvae frequently\r\nretain traces of ancestral stages of adult structure, embryos will\r\nrarely do so; and we are confronted again with the question, How are we\r\nto account for the presence in the embryo of numerous functionless\r\norgans which cannot be explained otherwise than as having been inherited\r\nfrom a previous condition in which they were functional? The answer is\r\nthat the only organs of this kind which have been retained are organs\r\nwhich have been retained by the larvae of the ancestors after they have\r\nbeen lost by the adult, and have become in this way impressed upon the\r\ndevelopment. As an illustration taken from current natural history of\r\nthe manner in which larval characters are in actual process of becoming\r\nembryonic may be mentioned the case of the viviparous salamander\r\n(_Salamander atra_), in which the gills, &c., are all developed but\r\nnever used, the animal being born without them. In other and closely\r\nallied species of salamander there is a considerable period of larval\r\nlife in which the gills and gill-slits are functional, but in this\r\nspecies the larval stage, for the existence of which there was a\r\ndistinct reason, viz. the entirely aquatic habits of life in the young\r\nstate, has become at one stroke embryonic by its simple absorption into\r\nthe embryonic period. The view, then, that embryonic development is\r\nessentially a recapitulation of ancestral history must be given up; it\r\ncontains only a few references to ancestral history, namely, those which\r\nhave been preserved probably in a much modified form by previous larvae.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Law of v. Baer.\r\n\r\nWe must now pass to the consideration of another supposed law of\r\nembryology--the so-called law of v. Baer. This generalization is usually\r\nstated as follows:--Embryos of different species of the same group are\r\nmore alike than adults, and the resemblances are greater the younger the\r\nembryo examined. Great importance has been attached to this\r\ngeneralization by embryologists and naturalists, and it is very widely\r\naccepted. Nevertheless, it is open to serious criticism. If it were\r\ntrue, we should expect to find that embryos of closely similar species\r\nwould be indistinguishable, but this is notoriously not the case. On the\r\ncontrary, they often differ more than do the adults, in support of which\r\nstatement the embryos of the different species of _Peripatus_ may be\r\nreferred to. The generalization undoubtedly had its origin in the fact\r\nthat there is what may be called a family resemblance between embryos,\r\nbut this resemblance, which is by no means exact, is purely superficial,\r\nand does not extend to anatomical detail. On the contrary, it may be\r\nfairly argued that in some cases embryos of widely dissimilar members of\r\nthe same group present anatomical differences of a higher morphological\r\nvalue than do the adults (see Sedgwick, _loc. cit_.), and, as stated\r\nabove the embryos of closely allied animals are distinguishable at all\r\nstages of development, though the distinguishing features are not the\r\nsame as those which distinguish the adults. To say that the development\r\nof the organism and of its component parts is a progress from the simple\r\nto the complex is to state a truism, but to state that it is also a\r\nprogress from the general to the special is to go altogether beyond the\r\nfacts. The bipinnaria larva of an echinoderm, the trochosphere larva of\r\nan annelid, the blastodermic vesicle of a mammal are all as highly\r\nspecialized as their respective adults, but the specialization is for a\r\ndifferent purpose, and of a different kind to that which characterizes\r\nthe adult.\r\n\r\n\r\n  History of embryology.\r\n\r\nIn its scientific and systematic form embryology may be considered as\r\nhaving only taken birth within the last century, although the germ from\r\nwhich it sprung was already formed nearly half a century earlier. The\r\nancients, it is true, as we see by the writings of Aristotle and Galen,\r\npursued the subject with interest, and the indefatigable Greek\r\nnaturalist and philosopher had even made continued series of\r\nobservations on the progressive stages of development in the incubated\r\negg, and on the reproduction of various animals; but although, after the\r\nrevival of learning, various anatomists and physiologists from time to\r\ntime made contributions to the knowledge of the foetal structure in its\r\nlarger organs, yet from the minuteness of the observations required for\r\nembryological research, it was not till the microscope came into use for\r\nthe investigation of organic structure that any intimate knowledge was\r\nattained of the nature of organogenesis. It is not to be wondered at,\r\ntherefore, that during a long period, in this as in other branches of\r\nphysical inquiry, vague speculations took the place of direct\r\nobservation and more solid information. This is apparent in most of the\r\nworks treating of generation during the 16th and part of the 17th\r\ncenturies.[2]\r\n\r\nHarvey was the first to give, in the middle of the latter century, a new\r\nlife and direction to investigation of this subject, by his discovery of\r\nthe connexion between the cicatricula of the yolk and the rudiments of\r\nthe chick, and by his faithful description of the successive stages of\r\ndevelopment as observed in the incubated egg, as well as of the progress\r\nof gestation in some Mammalia. He had also the merit of fixing the\r\nattention of physiologists upon general laws of development as deduced\r\nfrom actual observation of the phenomena, by the enunciation of two\r\nimportant propositions, viz.--(1) that all animals are produced out of\r\nova, and (2) that the organs of the embryo arise by new formation, or\r\n_epigenesis,_ and not by mere enlargement out of a pre-existing\r\ninvisible condition (_Exercitationes de generatione animalium_,\r\nAmstelodami, 1651). Harvey's observations, however, were aided only by\r\nthe use of magnifying glasses (perspecillae), probably of no great\r\npower, and he saw nothing of the earliest appearances of the embryo in\r\nthe first thirty-six hours, and believed the blood and the heart to be\r\nthe parts first formed.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the work of Harvey, and of the successful application\r\nof the microscope to embryological investigation, was soon afterwards\r\napparent in the admirable researches of Malpighi of Bologna, as evinced\r\nby his communications to the Royal Society of London in 1672, \"De ovo\r\nincubato,\" and \"De formatione pulli,\" and more especially in his\r\ndelineations of some of the earlier phenomena of development, in which,\r\nas in many other parts of minute anatomy, he partially or wholly\r\nanticipated discoveries, the full development of which has only been\r\naccomplished in the present century. Malpighi traced the origin of the\r\nembryo almost to its very commencement in the formation of the\r\ncerebro-spinal groove within the cicatricula, which he removed from the\r\nopaque mass of the yolk; and he only erred in supposing the embryonal\r\nrudiments to have pre-existed as such in the egg, in consequence,\r\napparently, of his having employed for observation, in very warm\r\nweather, eggs which, though he believed them to be unincubated, had in\r\nreality undergone some of the earlier developmental changes.\r\n\r\nThe works of Walter Needham (1667), Regnier de Graaf (1673), Swammerdam\r\n(1685), Vallisneri (1689)--following upon those of Harvey--all contain\r\nimportant contributions to the knowledge of our subject, as tending to\r\nshow the similarity in the mode of production from ova in a variety of\r\nanimals with that previously best known in birds. The observations more\r\nespecially of de Graaf, Nicolas Steno and J. van Horne gave much greater\r\nprecision to the knowledge of the connexion between the origin of the\r\novum of quadrupeds and the vesicles of the ovary now termed Graafian,\r\nwhich de Graaf showed always burst and discharged their contents on the\r\noccurrence of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThese observations bring us to the period of Boerhaave and Albinus in\r\nthe earlier part of the 18th century, and in the succeeding years to\r\nthat of Haller, whose vast erudition and varied and accurate original\r\nobservations threw light upon the entire process of reproduction in\r\nanimals, and brought its history into a more systematic and intelligible\r\nform. A considerable part of the seventh and the whole of the eighth\r\nvolumes of Haller's great work, the _Elementa physiologiae_, published\r\nat successive times from 1757 to 1766, are occupied with the general\r\nview of the function of generation, while his special contributions to\r\nembryology are contained in his _Deux memoires sur la formation du coeur\r\ndans le poulet_ and _Deux memoires sur la formation des os_, both\r\npublished at Lausanne in 1758, and republished in an extended and\r\naltered form, together with his \"Observations on the early condition of\r\nthe Embryo in Quadrupeds,\" made along with Kuhlemann, in the _Opera\r\nminora_ (1762-1768). Though originally educated as a believer in the\r\ndoctrine of \"preformation\" by his teacher Boerhaave, Haller was soon led\r\nto abandon that view in favour of \"epigenesis\" or new formation, as may\r\nbe seen in various parts of his works published before the middle of the\r\ncentury; see especially a long note explanatory of the grounds of his\r\nchange of opinion in his edition of Boerhaave's _Praelectiones\r\nacademicae_, vol. v. part 2, p. 497 (1744), and his _Primae lineae\r\nphysiologiae_ (1747). But some years later, and after having been\r\nengaged in observing the phenomena of development in the incubated egg,\r\nhe again changed his views, and during the remainder of his life was a\r\nkeen opponent of the system of epigenesis, and a defender and exponent\r\nof the theory of \"evolution,\" as it was then named--a theory very\r\ndifferent from that now bearing the name, and which implied belief in\r\nthe pre-existence of the organs of the embryo in the germ, according to\r\nthe theory of encasement (_emboitement_) or inclusion supported by\r\nLeibnitz and Bonnet. (See the interesting work of Bonnet,\r\n_Considerations sur les corps organises_, Amsterdam, 1762, for an\r\naccount of his own views and those of Haller.)\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for Caspar Frederick Wolff (1733-1794), a German by\r\nbirth, but naturalized afterwards in Russia, to bring forward\r\nobservations which, though almost entirely neglected for a long time\r\nafter their publication, and in some measure discredited under the\r\ninfluence of Haller's authority, were sixty years later acknowledged to\r\nhave established the theory of epigenesis upon the secure basis of\r\nascertained facts, and to have laid the first foundation of the\r\nmorphological science of embryology. Wolff's work, entitled _Theoria\r\ngenerationis_, first published as an inaugural Dissertation at Berlin in\r\n1759, was republished with additions in German at Berlin in 1764, and\r\nagain in Latin at Halle in 1774. Wolff also wrote a \"Memoir on the\r\nDevelopment of the Intestine\" in _Nov. comment. acad. Petropol_., 1768\r\nand 1769. But it was not till the latter work was translated into German\r\nby J.F. Meckel, and appeared in his _Archiv_ for 1812, that Wolff's\r\npeculiar merits as the founder of modern embryology came to be known or\r\nfully appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe special novelty of Wolff's discoveries consisted mainly in this,\r\nthat he showed that the germinal part of the bird's egg forms a layer of\r\nunited granules or organized particles (cells of the modern\r\nhistologist), presenting at first no semblance of the form or structure\r\nof the future embryo, but gradually converted by various morphological\r\nchanges in the formative material, which are all capable of being traced\r\nby observation, into the several rudimentary organs and systems of the\r\nembryo. The earlier form of the embryo he delineated with accuracy; the\r\nactual mode of formation he traced in more than one organ, as for\r\nexample in the alimentary canal, and he was the discoverer of several\r\nnew and important embryological facts, as in the instance of the\r\nprimordial kidneys, which have thus been named the Wolffian bodies.\r\nWolff further showed that the growing parts of plants owe their origin\r\nto organized particles or cells, so that he was led to the great\r\ngeneralization that the processes of embryonic formation and of adult\r\ngrowth and nutrition are all of a like nature in both plants and\r\nanimals. No advance, however, was made upon the basis of Wolff's\r\ndiscoveries till the year 1817, when the researches of C.H. Pander on\r\nthe development of the chick gave a fuller and more exact view of the\r\nphenomena less clearly indicated by Wolff, and laid down with greater\r\nprecision a plan of the formation of parts in the embryo of birds, which\r\nmay be regarded as the foundation of the views of all subsequent\r\nembryologists.\r\n\r\nBut although the minuter investigation of the nature and true theory of\r\nthe process of embryonic development was thus held in abeyance for more\r\nthan half a century, the interval was not unproductive of observations\r\nhaving an important bearing on the knowledge of the anatomy of the\r\nfoetus and the function of reproduction. The great work of William\r\nHunter on the human gravid uterus, containing unequalled pictorial\r\nillustrations of its subject from the pencil of Rymsdyk and other\r\nartists, was published in 1775;[3] and during a large part of the same\r\nperiod numerous communications to the _Memoirs_ of the Royal Society\r\ntestified to the activity and genius of his brother, John Hunter, in the\r\ninvestigation of various parts of comparative embryology. But it is\r\nmainly in his rich museum, and in the manuscripts and drawings which he\r\nleft, and which have been in part described and published in the\r\ncatalogue of his wonderful collection, that we obtain any adequate idea\r\nof the unexampled industry and wide scope of research of that great\r\nanatomist and physiologist.\r\n\r\nAs belonging to a somewhat later period, but still before the time when\r\nthe more strict investigation of embryological phenomena was resumed by\r\nPander, there fall to be noticed, as indicative of the rapid progress\r\nthat was making, the experiments of L. Spallanzani, 1789; the researches\r\nof J.H. von Autenrieth, 1797, and of Soemmering, 1799, on the human\r\nfoetus; the observations of Senff on the formation of the skeleton,\r\n1801; those of L. Oken and D.G. Kieser on the intestine and other\r\norgans, 1806; Oken's remarkable work on the bones of the head, 1807\r\n(with the views promulgated in which Goethe's name is also intimately\r\nconnected); J.F. Meckel's numerous and valuable contributions to\r\nembryology and comparative anatomy, extending over a long series of\r\nyears; and F. Tiedemann's classical work on the development of the\r\nbrain, 1816.\r\n\r\nThe observations of the Russian naturalist, Christian Heinrich Pander\r\n(1794-1865), were made at the instance and under the immediate\r\nsupervision of Prof. Dollinger at Wurzburg, and we learn from von Baer's\r\nautobiography that he, being an early friend of Pander's, and knowing his\r\nqualifications for the task, had pointed him out to Dollinger as well\r\nfitted to carry out the investigation of development which that professor\r\nwas desirous of having accomplished. Pander's inaugural dissertation was\r\nentitled _Historia metamorphoseos quam ovum incubatum prioribus quinque\r\ndiebus subit_ (Virceburgi, 1817); and it was also published in German\r\nunder the title of _Beitrage zur Entwickelungsgeschichte des Huhnchens im\r\nEie_ (Wurzburg, 1817). The beautiful plates illustrating the latter work\r\nwere executed by the elder E.J. d'Alton, well known for his skill in\r\nscientific observation, delineation and engraving.\r\n\r\nPander observed the germinal membrane or _blastoderm_, as he for the\r\nfirst time called it, of the fowl's egg to acquire three layers of\r\norganized substance in the earlier period of incubation. These he named\r\nrespectively the serous or outer, the vascular or middle, and the mucous\r\nor inner layers; and he traced with great skill and care the origin of\r\nthe principal rudimentary organs and systems from each of these layers,\r\npointing out shortly, but much more distinctly than Wolff had done, the\r\nactual nature of the changes occurring in the process of development.\r\n\r\nKarl Ernest von Baer (q.v.), the greatest of modern embryologists,\r\nwas, as already remarked, the early friend of Pander, and, at the time\r\nwhen the latter was engaged in his researches at Wurzburg, was\r\nassociated with Dollinger as prosector, and engaged with him in the\r\nstudy of comparative anatomy. He witnessed, therefore, though he did not\r\nactually take part in, Pander's researches; and the latter having\r\nafterwards abandoned the inquiry, von Baer took it up for himself in the\r\nyear 1819, when he had obtained an appointment in the university of\r\nKonigsberg, where he was the colleague of Burdach and Rathke, both of\r\nwhom were able coadjutors in the investigation of the subject of his\r\nchoice. (See v. Baer's interesting autobiography, published on his\r\nretirement from St Petersburg to Dorpat in 1864.)\r\n\r\nVon Baer's observations were carried on at various times from 1819 to\r\n1826 and 1827, when he published the first results in a description of\r\nthe development of the chick in the first edition of Burdach's\r\n_Physiology_.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that von Baer made the important discovery of the\r\novarian ovum of mammals and of man, totally unknown before his time, and\r\nwas thus able to prove as matter of exact observation what had only been\r\nsurmised previously, viz. the entire similarity in the mode of origin of\r\nthese animals with others lower in the scale. (_Epistola de ovi\r\nmammalium et hominis genesi,_ Lipsiae, 1827. See also the interesting\r\ncommentary on or supplement to the _Epistola_ in Heusinger's Journal,\r\nand the translation in Breschet's _Repertoire_, Paris, 1829.)\r\n\r\nIn 1829 von Baer published the first part of his great work, entitled\r\n_Beobachtungen und Reflexionen uber die Entwickelungsgeschichte der\r\nThiere_, the second part of which, still leaving the work incomplete,\r\ndid not appear till 1838. In this work, distinguished by the fulness,\r\nrichness and extreme accuracy of the observations and descriptions, as\r\nwell as by the breadth and soundness of the general views on embryology\r\nand allied branches of biology which it presents, he gave a detailed\r\naccount not only of the whole progress of development of the chick as\r\nobserved day by day during the incubation of the egg, but he also\r\ndescribed what was known, and what he himself had investigated by\r\nnumerous and varied observations, of the whole course of formation of\r\nthe young in other vertebrate animals. His work is in fact a system of\r\ncomparative embryology, replete with new discoveries in almost every\r\npart.\r\n\r\nVon Baer's account of the layers of the blastoderm differs somewhat from\r\nthat of Pander, and appears to be more consistent with the further\r\nresearches which have lately been made than was at one time supposed, in\r\nthis respect, that he distinguished from a very early period two\r\nprimitive or fundamental layers, viz. the animal or upper, and the\r\nvegetative or lower, from each of which, in connexion with two\r\nintermediate layers derived from them, the fundamental organs and\r\nsystems of the embryo are derived:--the animal layer, with its\r\nderivative, supplying the dermal, neural, osseous and muscular; the\r\nvegetative layer, with its derivative, the vascular and mucous\r\n(intestinal) systems. He laid down the general morphological principle\r\nthat the fundamental organs have essentially the shape of tubular\r\ncavities, as appears in the first form of the central organ of the\r\nnervous system, in the two muscular and osseous tubes which form the\r\nwalls of the body, and in the intestinal canal; and he followed out with\r\nadmirable clearness the steps by which from these fundamental systems\r\nthe other organs arise secondarily, such as the organs of sense, the\r\nglands, lungs, heart, vascular glands, Wolffian bodies, kidneys and\r\ngenerative organs.\r\n\r\nTo complete von Baer's system there was mainly wanting a more minute\r\nknowledge of the intimate structure of the elementary tissues, but this\r\nhad not yet been acquired by biologists, and it remained for Theodor\r\nSchwann of Liege in 1839, along with whom should be mentioned those who,\r\nlike Robert Brown and M.J. Schleiden, prepared the way for his great\r\ndiscovery, to point out the uniformity in histological structure of the\r\nsimpler forms of plants and animals, the nature of the organized animal\r\nand vegetable cell, the cellular constitution of the primitive ovum of\r\nanimals, and the derivation of the various tissues, complex as well as\r\nsimple, from the transformation or, as it is now called, differentiation\r\nof simple cellular elements,--discoveries which have exercised a\r\npowerful and lasting influence on the whole progress of biological\r\nknowledge in our time, and have contributed in an eminent degree to\r\npromote the advance of embryology itself.\r\n\r\nTo K.B. Reichert of Berlin more particularly is due the first\r\napplication of the newer histological views to the explanation of the\r\nphenomena of development, 1840. To him and to R.A. von Kolliker and R.\r\nVirchow is due the ascertainment of the general principle that there is\r\nno free-cell formation in embryonic development and growth, but that all\r\norgans are derived from the multiplication, combination and\r\ntransformation of cells, and that all cells giving rise to organs are\r\nthe descendants or progeny of previously existing cells, and that these\r\nmay be traced back to the original cell or cell-substance of the ovum.\r\n\r\nIt may be that modern research has somewhat modified the views taken by\r\nbiologists of the statements of Schwann as to the constitution of the\r\norganized cell, especially as regards its simplest or most elementary\r\nform, and has indicated more exactly the nature of the protoplasmic\r\nmaterial which constitutes its living basis; but it has not caused any\r\nvery wide departure from the general principles enunciated by that\r\nphysiologist. Schwann's treatise, entitled _Microscopical Researches\r\ninto the Accordance in the Structure and Growths of Animals and Plants_,\r\nwas published in German at Berlin in 1839, and was translated into\r\nEnglish by Henry Smith, and printed for the Sydenham Society in 1847,\r\nalong with a translation of Schleiden's memoir, \"Contributions to\r\nPhytogenesis,\" which originally appeared in 1838 in Muller's _Archiv_\r\nfor that year, and which had also been published in English in Taylor\r\nand Francis's _Scientific Memoirs_, vol. ii. part vi.\r\n\r\nAmong the newer observations of the same period which contributed to a\r\nmore exact knowledge of the structure of the ovum itself may be\r\nmentioned--first the discovery of the germinal vesicle, or nucleus, in\r\nthe germ-disk of birds by J.E. von Purkinje (_Symbolae ad ovi avium\r\nhistoriam ante incubationem_, Vratislaviae, 1825, and republished at\r\nLeipzig in 1830); second, von Baer's discovery of the mammiferous ovum\r\nin 1827, already referred to; third, the discovery of the germinal\r\nvesicle of mammals by J.V. Coste in 1834, and its independent\r\nobservation by Wharton Jones in 1835; and fourth, the observation in the\r\nsame year by Rudolph Wagner of the germinal macula or nucleus. Coste's\r\ndiscovery of the germinal vesicle of Mammalia was first communicated to\r\nthe public in the _Comptes rendus_ of the French Academy for 1833, and\r\nwas more fully described in the _Recherches sur la generation des\r\nmammiferes_, by Delpech and Coste (Paris, 1834). Thomas Wharton Jones's\r\nobservations, made in the autumn of 1834, without a knowledge of Coste's\r\ncommunication, were presented to the Royal Society in 1835. This\r\ndiscovery was also confirmed and extended by G.G. Valentin and Bernardt,\r\nas recorded by the latter in his work _Symb. ad ovi mammal. hist. ante\r\npraegnationem_. Rudolph Wagner's observations first appeared in his\r\n_Textbook of Comparative Anatomy_, published at Leipzig in 1834-1835,\r\nand in Muller's _Archiv_ for the latter year. His more extended\r\nresearches are described in his work _Prodromus hist. generationis\r\nhominis atque animalium_ (Leipzig, 1836), and in a memoir inserted in\r\nthe _Trans. of the Roy. Bavarian Acad. of Sciences_ (Munich, 1837).\r\n\r\nThe two decades of years from 1820 to 1840 were peculiarly fertile in\r\ncontributions to the anatomy of the foetus and the progress of\r\nembryological knowledge. The researches of Prevost and Dumas on the ova\r\nand primary stages of development of Batrachia, birds and mammals, made\r\nas early as 1824, deserve especial notice as important steps in advance,\r\nboth in the discovery of the process of yolk segmentation in the\r\nbatrachian ovum, and in their having shown almost with the force of\r\ndemonstration, previous to the discovery of the mammiferous ovarian ovum\r\nby von Baer, that that body must exist as a minute spherule in the\r\nGraafian follicle of the ovary, although they did not actually succeed\r\nin bringing the ova clearly under observation.\r\n\r\nThe works of Pockels (1825), of Seiler (1831), of G. Breschet (1832), of\r\nA.A.L.M. Velpeau (1833), of T.L.W. Bischoff (1834)--all bearing upon\r\nhuman embryology; the researches of Coste in comparative embryology in\r\n1834, already referred to, and those published by the same author in\r\n1837; the publication of Johannes Muller's great work on physiology, and\r\nRudolph Wagner's smaller text-book, in both of which the subject of\r\nembryology received a very full treatment, together with the excellent\r\n_Manual of the Development of the Foetus_, by Valentin, in 1835, the\r\nfirst separate and systematic work on the whole subject, now secured to\r\nembryology its permanent place among the biological sciences on the\r\nContinent; while in this country attention was drawn to the subject by\r\nthe memoirs of Allen Thomson (1831), Th. Wharton Jones (1835-1838) and\r\nMartin Barry (1839-1840).\r\n\r\nAmong the more remarkable special discoveries which belong to the period\r\nnow referred to, a few may be mentioned, as, for example, that of the\r\nchorda dorsalis by von Baer, a most important one, which may be regarded\r\nas the key to the whole of vertebral morphology; the phenomenon of yolk\r\nsegmentation, now known to be universal among animals, but which was\r\nonly first carefully observed in Batrachia by Prevost and Dumas (though\r\npreviously casually noticed by Swammerdam), and was soon afterwards\r\nfollowed out by Rusconi and von Baer in fishes; the discovery of the\r\nbranchial clefts, plates and vascular arches in the embryos of the\r\nhigher abranchiate animals by H. Rathke in 1825-1827; the able\r\ninvestigation of the transformations of these arches by Reichert in\r\n1837; and the researches on the origin and development of the urinary\r\nand generative organs by Johannes Muller in 1829-1830.\r\n\r\nOn entering the fifth decade of the 19th century, the number of original\r\ncontributions and systematic treatises becomes so great as to render the\r\nattempt to enumerate even a selection of the more important of them\r\nquite unsuitable to the limits of the present article. We must be\r\nsatisfied, therefore, with a reference to one or two which seem to stand\r\nout with greater prominence than the rest as landmarks in the progress\r\nof embryological discovery. Among these may first be mentioned the\r\nresearches of Theodor L.W. von Bischoff, formerly of Giessen and later\r\nof Munich, on the development of the ovum in Mammalia, in which a series\r\nof the most laborious, minute and accurate observations furnished a\r\ngreatly novel and very full history of the formative process in several\r\nanimals of that class. These researches are contained in four memoirs,\r\ntreating separately of the development of the rabbit, the dog, the\r\nguinea-pig and the roe-deer, and appeared in succession in the years\r\n1842, 1845, 1852 and 1854.\r\n\r\nNext may be mentioned the great work of Coste, entitled _Histoire gen.\r\net particul. du developpement des animaux_, of which, however, only four\r\nfasciculi appeared between the years 1847 and 1859, leaving the work\r\nincomplete. In this work, in the large folio form, beautiful\r\nrepresentations are given of the author's valuable observations on human\r\nembryology, and on that of various mammals, birds and fishes, and of the\r\nauthor's discovery in 1847 of the process of partial yolk segmentation\r\nin the germinal disk of the fowl's egg during its descent through the\r\noviduct, and his observations on the same phenomenon in fishes and\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\nThe development of reptiles received important elucidation from the\r\nresearches of Rathke, in his history of the development of serpents,\r\npublished at Konigsberg in 1839, and in a similar work on the turtle in\r\n1848, as well as in a later one on the crocodile in 1866, along with\r\nwhich may be associated the observations of H.J. Clark on the\r\n\"Embryology of the Turtle,\" published in Agassiz's _Contributions to\r\nNatural History, &c._, 1857.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of yolk segmentation, to which reference has more than\r\nonce been made, and to which later researches give more and more\r\nimportance in connexion with the fundamental phenomena of development,\r\nreceived great elucidation during this period, first from the\r\nobservations of C.T.E. von Siebold and those of Bagge on the complete\r\nyolk segmentation of the egg in nematoid worms in 1841, and more fully\r\nby the observations of Kolliker in the same animals in 1843. The nature\r\nof partial segmentation of the yolk was first made known by Kolliker in\r\nhis work on the development of the Cephalopoda in 1844, and, as has\r\nalready been mentioned, the phenomena were observed by Coste in the eggs\r\nof birds. The latter observations have since been confirmed by those of\r\nOellacher, Gotte and Kolliker. Further researches in a vast number of\r\nanimals give every reason to believe that the phenomenon of segmentation\r\nis in some shape or other the invariable precursor of embryonic\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThe first considerable work on the development of a division of the\r\ninvertebrates was that of Maurice Herold of Marburg on spiders, _De\r\ngeneratione aranearum ex ovo_, published at Marburg in 1824, in which\r\nthe whole phenomena of the formative processes in that animal are\r\ndescribed with remarkable clearness and completeness. A few years later\r\nan important series of contributions to the history of the development\r\nof invertebrate animals appeared in the second volume of Burdach's work\r\non _Physiology_, of which the first edition was published in 1828, and\r\nin this the history of the development of the Entozoa was the production\r\nof Ch. Theod. von Siebold, and that of most of the other invertebrates\r\nwas compiled by H. Rathke from the results of his own observations and\r\nthose of others. These memoirs, together with others subsequently\r\npublished by Rathke, notably that _Uber die Bildung und\r\nEntwickelungsgeschichte d. Flusskrebses_ (Leipzig, 1829), in which an\r\nattempt is made to extend the doctrine of the derivation of the organs\r\nfrom the germinal layers to the invertebrata, entitle him to be regarded\r\nas the founder of invertebrate embryology.\r\n\r\nA large body of facts having by this time been ascertained with respect\r\nto the more obvious processes of development, a further attempt to refer\r\nthe phenomena of organogenesis to morphological and histological\r\nprinciples became desirable. More especially was the need felt to point\r\nout with greater minuteness and accuracy the relation in which the\r\norigin of the fundamental organs of the embryo stands to the layers of\r\nthe blastoderm; and this we find accomplished with signal success in the\r\nresearches of R. Remak on the development of the chick and frog,\r\npublished between the years 1850 and 1855.\r\n\r\nStarting from Pander's discovery of the trilaminate blastoderm, Remak\r\nworked out the development of the chick in the light of the cell-theory\r\nof Schleiden and Schwann. He observed the division of the middle layer\r\ninto two by a split which subsequently gives rise to the body-cavity\r\n(pleuro-peritoneal space) of the adult; and traced the principal organs\r\nwhich came from these two layers (_Hautfaserblatt_ and _Darmfaserblatt_)\r\nrespectively. In this manner the foundations of the germ-layer theory\r\nwere established in their modern form.\r\n\r\nA great step forward was made in 1859 by T.H. Huxley, who compared the\r\nserous and mucous layers of Pander with the ectoderm and endoderm of the\r\nCoelenterata. But in spite of this comparison it was generally held that\r\ngerminal layers similar to those of the vertebrata were not found in\r\ninvertebrate animals, and it was not until the publication in 1871 of\r\nKowalewsky's researches (see below) that the germinal layer theory was\r\napplied to the embryos of all the Metazoa. But the year 1859 will be for\r\never memorable in the history of science as the year of the publication\r\nof the _Origin of Species_. If the enunciation of the cell-theory may be\r\nsaid to have marked a first from a second period in the history of\r\nembryology, the publication of Darwin's great idea ushered in a third.\r\nWhereas hitherto the facts of anatomy and development were loosely held\r\ntogether by the theory of types which owed its origin and maintenance to\r\nCuvier, L. Agassiz, J. Muller and R. Owen, they were now combined into\r\none organic whole by the theory of descent and by the hypothesis of\r\nrecapitulation which was deduced from that theory. First clearly\r\nenunciated by Johann Muller in his well-known work _Fur Darwin_\r\npublished in 1864 (rendered in England as _Facts for Darwin_, 1869), the\r\nview that a knowledge of embryonic and larval histories would lay bare\r\nthe secrets of race history and enable the course of evolution to be\r\ntraced and so lead to the discovery of the natural system of\r\nclassification, gave a powerful stimulus to embryological research. The\r\nfirst fruits of this impetus were gathered by Alexander Agassiz, A.\r\nKowalewsky and E. Metschnikoff. Agassiz, in his memoir on the\r\n_Embryology of the Starfish_ published in 1864, showed that the\r\nbody-cavity in Echinodermata arises as a differentiation of the enteron\r\nof the larva and so laid the foundations of our present knowledge of the\r\ncoelom. This discovery was confirmed in 1869 by Metschnikoff (\"Studien\r\nub. d. Entwick. d. Echinodermen u. Nemertinen,\" _Mem. Ac. Petersbourg_\r\n(7), 41, 1869), and extended by him to Tornaria, the larva of\r\n_Balanoglossus_ in 1870 (\"Untersuchungen ub. d. Metamorphose einiger\r\nSeethiere,\" _Zeit. f. wiss. Zoologie_, 20, 1870). In 1871 Kowalewsky in\r\nhis classical memoir, entitled \"Embryologische Studien an Wurmern und\r\nArthropoden\" (_Mem. Acad. Petersbourg_ (7), 16, 1871), proved the same\r\nfact for Sagitta and added immensely to our knowledge of the early\r\nstages of development of the Invertebrata. These memoirs formed the\r\nbasis on which subsequent workers took their stand. Amongst the most\r\nimportant of these was F.M. Balfour (1851-1882). Led to the study of\r\nembryology by his teacher, M. Foster, in association with whom he\r\npublished in 1874 the Elements of Embryology, Balfour was one of the\r\nfirst to take advantage of the facilities for research offered by Dr. A.\r\nDohrn's Zoological Station at Naples which has since become so\r\ncelebrated. Here he did the work which was subsequently published in\r\n1878 in his _Monograph of the Development of Elasmobranch Fishes_, and\r\nwhich constituted the most important addition to vertebrate morphology\r\nsince the days of Johannes Muller. This was followed in 1879 and 1881 by\r\nthe publication of his _Treatise on Comparative Embryology_, the first\r\nwork in which the facts of the rapidly growing science were clearly and\r\nphilosophically put together, and the greatest. The influence of\r\nBalfour's work on embryology was immense and is still felt. He was an\r\nactive worker in every department of it, and there are few groups of the\r\nanimal kingdom on which he has not left the impress of his genius.\r\n\r\nIn the period under consideration the output of embryological work has\r\nbeen enormous. No group of the animal kingdom has escaped exhaustive\r\nexamination, and no effort has been spared to obtain the embryos of\r\nisolated and out of the way forms, the development of which might have a\r\nbearing upon important questions of phylogeny and classification. Of\r\nthis work it is impossible to speak in detail in this summary. It is\r\nonly possible to call attention to some of its more important features,\r\nto mention the more important advances, and to refer to some of the more\r\nstriking memoirs.\r\n\r\nMarine zoological stations have been established, expeditions have been\r\nsent to distant countries, and the methods of investigation have been\r\ngreatly improved. Since Anton Dohrn founded the Stazione Zoologica at\r\nNaples in 1872, observatories for the study of marine organisms have\r\nbeen established in most countries. Of journeys which have been made to\r\ndistant countries and which have resulted in important contributions to\r\nembryology, may be mentioned the expedition (1884-1886) of the cousins\r\nSarasin to Ceylon (development of Gymnophiona), of E. Selenka to Brazil\r\nand the East Indies (development of Marsupials, Primates and other\r\nmammals, 1877, 1889, 1892), of A.A.W. Hubrecht to the East Indies (1890,\r\ndevelopment of _Tarsius_), of W.H. Caldwell to Australia (1883-1884,\r\ndiscovery of the nature of the ovum and oviposition of _Echidna_ and of\r\n_Ceratodus_), of A. Sedgwick to the Cape (1883, development of\r\n_Peripatus_), of J. Graham Kerr to Paraguay (1896, development of\r\n_Lepidosiren_), of R. Semon to Australia and the Malay Archipelago\r\n(1891-1893, development of Monotremata, Marsupialia), and of J.S.\r\nBudgett to Africa (1898, 1900, 1901, 1903, development of _Polypterus_).\r\n\r\nIn methods, while great improvements have been made in the processes of\r\nhardening and staining embryos, the principal advance has been the\r\nintroduction in 1883 by W.H. Caldwell in his work on the development of\r\n_Phoronis_ of the method of making tape-worm like strings of sections as\r\na result of which the process of mounting in order all the sections\r\nobtained from an embryo was much facilitated, and the use of an\r\nautomatic microtome rendered possible. The method of Golgi for the\r\ninvestigation of the nervous system, introduced in 1875, must also be\r\nmentioned here.\r\n\r\nThe word \"coelom\" (q.v.) was introduced into zoology by E. Haeckel in\r\n1872 (_Kalkschwamme_, p. 468) as a convenient term for the body-cavity\r\n(pleuro-peritoneal). The word was generally adopted, and was applied\r\nalike to the blood-containing body-cavity of Arthropods and to the\r\nbody-cavity of Vertebrata and segmented worms, in which there is no\r\nblood. In 1875 Huxley (_Quarterly Journ. of Mic. Science_, 15, p. 53),\r\nrelying on the researches of Agassiz, Metschnikoff and Kowalewsky above\r\nmentioned, put forward the idea that according to their development\r\nthree kinds of body-cavity ought to be distinguished: (1) the\r\nenterocoelic which arises from enteric diverticula, (2) the schizocoelic\r\nwhich develops as a split in the embryonic mesoblast, and (3) the\r\nepicoelic which was enclosed by folds of the skin and lined by ectoderm\r\n(e.g. atrial cavity of Tunicates, &c.). This suggestion was of great\r\nimportance, because it led the embryologists of the day (Balfour, the\r\nbrothers Hertwig, Lankester and others) to discuss the question as to\r\nwhether there was not more than one kind of body-cavity. The Hertwigs\r\n(_Coelomtheorie_, Jena, 1881) distinguished two kinds, the enterocoel\r\nand the pseudocoel. The former, to which they limited the use of the\r\nword coelom, and which is developed directly or indirectly from the\r\nenteron, is found in Annelida, Arthropoda, Echinodermata, Chordata, &c.\r\nThe latter they regarded as something quite different from the coelom\r\nand as arising by a split in what they called for the first time\r\nmesenchyme; the mesenchyme being the non-epithelial mesoderm, which they\r\ndescribed as consisting of amoeboid cells, but which we now know to\r\nconsist of a continuous reticulum. The next step was made by E. Ray\r\nLankester, who in 1884 (_Zoologischer Anzeiger_) showed that the\r\npericardium of Mollusca does not contain blood, and therein differs from\r\nthe rest of the body-cavity which does contain blood, but no suggestion\r\nis made that the blood-containing space is not coelomic. In fact it was\r\ngenerally held by the anatomists of the day that the coelom and the\r\nvascular system were different parts of the same primitive organ, though\r\nseparate from it in the adult except in Arthropoda and Mollusca. In the\r\nMollusca, it is true, the pericardial part of the coelom was held to be\r\nseparate from the vascular, and the Hertwigs had reached the correct\r\nconception that the pericardium of these animals was alone true coelom,\r\nthe vascular part being pseudocoel. This was the state of morphological\r\nopinion until 1886, when it was shown (_Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc._, 6,\r\n1886, p. 27) (1) that the coelom of _Peripatus_ gives rise to the\r\nnephridia and generative glands only, and to no other part of the\r\nbody-cavity of the adult, (2) that the nephridia of the adult do not\r\nopen as had been supposed into the body-cavity, (3) that the body-cavity\r\nis entirely formed of the blood-containing space, the coelom having no\r\nperivisceral portion. These results were extended by the same author\r\n(_Quart. Journ. Mic. Sci._, 27, 1887, pp. 486-540) to other Arthropods\r\nand to the Mollusca, and the modern theory of the coelom was finally\r\nestablished. An increased precision was given to the conception of\r\ncoelom by the discovery in 1880 (_Quart. Journ. Mic. Sci._, 20, p. 164)\r\nthat the nephridia of Elasmobranchs are a direct differentiation of a\r\nportion of it. In 1886 this was extended to _Peripatus_ (_Proc. Camb.\r\nPhil. Soc._, 6, p. 27) and doubtless holds universally.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 it was suggested by V. Hensen (Virchow's _Archiv_, 31) that the\r\nrudiments of nerve-fibres are present from the beginning of development\r\nas persistent remains of connexions between the incompletely separated\r\ncells of the segmented ovum. This suggestion fell to the ground because\r\nit was held by embryologists that the cleavage of the ovum resulted in\r\nthe formation of completely separate cells, and that the connexions\r\nbetween the adult cells were secondary. In 1886 it was shown (_Quarterly\r\nJourn. Mic. Sci._, 26, p. 182) that in _Peripatus Capensis_ the cells of\r\nthe segmenting ovum do not separate from one another, but remain\r\nconnected by a loose protoplasmic network. This discovery has since been\r\nextended to other ova, even to the small so-called holoblastic ova, and\r\na basis of fact was found for Hensen's suggestion as to the embryonic\r\norigin of nerves (_Quart. Journ. Mic. Sci._, 33, 1892, pp. 581-584). An\r\nextension and further application of the new views as to the cell-theory\r\nand the embryonic origin of nerves thus necessitated was made in 1894\r\n(_Quart. Journ. Mic. Sci._, 37, p. 87), and in 1904 J. Graham Kerr\r\nshowed that the motor nerves in the dipnoan fish Lepidosiren arise in an\r\nessentially similar manner (_Trans. Roy. Society of Edinburgh_, 41, p.\r\n119).\r\n\r\nIn 1883 Elie Metschnikoff published his researches on the intracellular\r\ndigestion of invertebrates (_Arbeiten a. d. zoologischen Inst. Wien_, 5;\r\nand _Biologisches Centralblatt_, 3, p. 560); these formed the basis of\r\nhis theory of inflammation and phagocytosis, which has had such an\r\nimportant influence on pathology. As he himself has told us, he was led\r\nto make these investigations by his precedent researches on the\r\ndevelopment of sponges and other invertebrates. To quote his own words:\r\n\"Having long studied the problem of the germinal layers in the animal\r\nseries, I sought to give some idea of their origin and significance. The\r\npart played by the ectoderm and endoderm appeared quite clear, and the\r\nformer might reasonably be regarded as the cutaneous investment of\r\nprimitive multicellular animals, while the latter might be regarded as\r\ntheir organ of digestion. The discovery of intracellular digestion in\r\nmany of the lower animals led me to regard this phenomenon as\r\ncharacteristic of those ancestral animals from which might be derived\r\nall the known types of the animal kingdom (excepting, of course, the\r\nProtozoa). The origin and part played by the mesoderm appeared the most\r\nobscure. Thus certain embryologists supposed that this layer\r\ncorresponded to the reproductive organs of primitive animals: others\r\nregarded it as the prototype of the organs of locomotion. My\r\nembryological and physiological studies on sponges led me to the\r\nconclusion that the mesoderm must function in the hypothetically\r\nprimitive animals as a mass of digestive cells, in all points similar to\r\nthose of the endoderm. This hypothesis necessarily attracted my\r\nattention to the power of seizing foreign corpuscles possessed by the\r\nmesodermic cells\" (_Immunity in Infective Diseases_, English\r\ntranslation, Cambridge, 1905).\r\n\r\nThe branch of embryology which concerns itself with the study of the\r\norigin, history and conjugation of the individuals (gametes) which are\r\nconcerned in the reproduction of the species has made great advances.\r\nThese began in 1875 and following years with a careful examination of\r\nthe behaviour of the germinal vesicle in the maturation and\r\nfertilization of the ovum. The history of the polar bodies, the origin\r\nof the female pronucleus, the presence in the ovum of a second nucleus,\r\nthe male pronucleus, which gave rise to the first segmentation nucleus\r\nby fusion with the female pronucleus, were discovered (E. van Beneden,\r\nO. Butschli, O. Hertwig, H. Fol), and in 1876 O. Hertwig\r\n(_Morphologisches Jahrbuch_, 3, 1876) for the first time observed the\r\nentrance of a spermatozoon into the egg and the formation of the male\r\npronucleus from it. The centrosome was discovered by W. Flemming in 1875\r\nin the egg of the fresh-water mussel, and independently in 1876 by E.\r\nvan Beneden in Dicyemids. In 1883 came E. van Beneden's celebrated\r\ndiscovery (_Arch. Biologie_, 4) of the reduction of the number of\r\nchromosomes in the nucleus of both male and female gametes, and of the\r\nfact that the male and female pronuclei contribute the same number of\r\nchromosomes to the zygote-nucleus. He also showed that the gametogenesis\r\nin the male is a similar process to that in the female, and paved the\r\nway for the acceptation of the view (due to Butschli) that polar bodies\r\nare aborted female gametes. These discoveries were extended and\r\ncompleted by subsequent workers, among whom may be mentioned E. van\r\nBeneden, J.B. Carnoy, G. Platner, T. Boveri, O. Hertwig, A. Brauer. The\r\nsubject is still being actively pursued, and hopes are entertained that\r\nsome relation may be found between the behaviour of the chromosomes and\r\nthe facts of heredity.\r\n\r\nSince 1874 (W. His, _Unsere Korperform und das physiologische Problem\r\nihrer Entstehung_) a new branch of embryology, which concerns itself\r\nwith the physiology of development, has arisen (experimental\r\nembryology). The principal workers in this field have been W. Roux, who\r\nin 1894 founded the _Archiv fur Entwickelungsmechanik der Organismen_,\r\nT. Boveri and Y. Delage who discovered and elucidated the phenomenon of\r\nmerogony, J. Loeb who discovered artificial parthenogenesis, O. and R.\r\nHertwig, H. Driesch, C. Herbst, E. Maupas, A. Weismann, T.H. Morgan,\r\nC.B. Davenport (_Experimental Morphology_, 2 vols., 1899) and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIn the elucidation of remarkable life-histories we may point in the\r\nfirst place to the work of A. Kowalewsky on the development of the\r\nTunicata (\"Entwickelungsgeschichte d. einfachen Ascidien,\" _Mem. Acad.\r\nPetersbourg_ (7), 10, 1866, and _Arch. f. Mic. Anatomie_, 7, 1871), in\r\nwhich was demonstrated for the first time the vertebrate relationship of\r\nthe Tunicata (possession of a notochord, method of development of the\r\ncentral nervous system) and which led to the establishment of the group\r\nChordata. We may also mention the work of Y. Delage in the metamorphosis\r\nof _Sacculina_ (_Arch. zool. exp._ (2) 2, 1884), A. Giard (_Comptes\r\nrendus_, 123, 1896, p. 836) and of A. Malaquin on _Monstrilla_ (_Arch.\r\nzool. exp._ (3), 9, p. 81, 1901), of Delage (_Comptes rendus_, 103,\r\n1886, p. 698) and Grassi and Calandruccio (_Rend. Acc. Lincei_ (5), 6,\r\n1897, p. 43), on the development of the eels, and of P. Pergande on the\r\nlife-history of the Aphidae (_Bull. U.S. Dep. Agric. Ent._, technical\r\nseries, 9, 1901). The work of C. Grobben (_Arbeiten zool. Inst. Wien_,\r\n4, 1882) and of B. Uljanin (\"Die Arten der Gattung Doliolum,\" _Fauna u.\r\nFlora des Golfes von Neapel_, 1884) on the extraordinary life-history\r\nand migration of the buds in _Doliolum_ must also be mentioned. In pure\r\nembryological morphology we have had Heymons' elucidation of the\r\nArthropod head, the work of Hatschek on Annelid and other larvae, the\r\nworks of H. Bury and of E.W. MacBride which have marked a distinct\r\nadvance in our knowledge of the development of Echinodermata, of K.\r\nMitsukuri, who has founded since 1882 an important school of embryology\r\nin Japan, on the early development of Chelonia and Aves, of A. Brauer\r\nand G.C. Price on the development of vertebrate excretory organs, of Th.\r\nW. Bischoff, E. van Beneden, E. Selenka, A.A.W. Hubrecht, R. Bonnet, F.\r\nKeibel and R. Assheton on the development of mammals, of A.A.W. Hubrecht\r\nand E. Selenka on the early development and placentation of the\r\nPrimates, of J. Graham Kerr and of J.S. Budgett on the development of\r\nDipnoan and Ganoid fishes, of A. Kowalewsky, B. Hatschek, A. Willey and\r\nE.W. MacBride on the development of Amphioxus, of B. Dean on the\r\ndevelopment of Bdellostoma, of A. Gotte on the development of Amphibia,\r\nof H. Strahl and L. Will on the early development of reptiles, of T.H.\r\nHuxley, C. Gegenbaur and W.K. Parker on the development of the\r\nvertebrate skeleton, of van Wijhe on the segmentation of the vertebrate\r\nhead, by which the modern theory of head-segmentation, previously\r\nadumbrated by Balfour, was first established, of Leche and Rose on the\r\ndevelopment of mammalian dentitions. We may also specially notice W.\r\nBateson's work on the development of _Balanoglossus_ and his inclusion\r\nof this genus among the Chordata (1884), the discovery by J.P. Hill of a\r\nplacenta in the marsupial genus _Perameles_ (1895), the work of P.\r\nMarchal (1904) on the asexual increase by fission of the early embryos\r\nof certain parasitic Hymenoptera (so called germinogony), a phenomenon\r\nwhich had been long ago shown to occur in _Lumbricus trapezoides_ by N.\r\nKleinenberg (1879) and by S.F. Harmer in Polyzoa (1893). The work on\r\ncell-lineage which has been so actively pursued in America may be\r\nmentioned here. It has consisted mainly of an extension of the early\r\nwork of A. Kowalewsky and B. Hatschek on the formation of the layers,\r\nbeing a more minute and detailed examination of the origin of the\r\nembryonic tissues.\r\n\r\n  The most important text-books and summaries which have appeared in\r\n  this period have been Korschelt and Heider's _Lehrbuch der\r\n  vergleichenden Entwickelungsgeschichte der wirbellosen Tiere_\r\n  (1890-1902), C.S. Minot's _Human Embryology_ (1892), and the _Handbuch\r\n  der vergleichenden und experimentellen Entwickelungslehre der\r\n  Wirbeltiere_, edited by O. Hertwig (1901, et seq.).

Se.*)\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGY OF DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nPhysiology of Development [in German, _Entwicklungsmechanik_ (W. Roux),\r\n_Entwicklungsphysiologie_ (H. Driesch), _physiologische Morphologie_ (J.\r\nLoeb)] is, in the broadest meaning of the word, the experimental science\r\nof morphogenesis, i.e. of the laws that govern morphological\r\ndifferentiation. In this sense it embraces the study of regeneration and\r\nvariation, and would, as a whole, best be called rational morphology.\r\nHere we shall treat of the Physiology of Development in a narrower\r\nsense, as the study of the laws that govern the development of the adult\r\norganism from the egg, REGENERATION and VARIATION AND SELECTION forming\r\nthe subjects of special articles.\r\n\r\nAfter the work done by W. His, A. Goette and E.F.W. Pfluger, who gave a\r\nsort of general outline and orientation of the subject, the first to\r\nstudy developmental problems properly in a systematical way, and with\r\nfull conviction of their great importance, was Wilhelm Roux. This\r\nobserver, having found by a full analysis of the facts of \"development\"\r\nthat the first special problem to be worked out was the question when\r\nand where the first differentiation appeared, got as his main result\r\nthat, when one of the two first blastomeres (cleavage cells) of the\r\nfrog's egg was killed, the living one developed into a typical\r\nhalf-embryo, i.e. an embryo that was either the right or the left part\r\nof a whole one. From that Roux concluded that the first cleavage plane\r\ndetermined already the median plane of the adult; and that the basis of\r\nall differentiation was given by an unequal division of the nuclear\r\nsubstances during karyokinesis, a result that was also attained on a\r\npurely theoretical basis by A. Weismann. Hans Driesch repeated Roux's\r\nfundamental experiment with a different method on the sea-urchin's egg,\r\nwith a result that was absolutely contrary to that of Roux: the isolated\r\nblastomere cleaved like half the egg, but it resulted in a whole\r\nblastula and a whole embryo, which differed from a normal one only in\r\nits small size. Driesch's result was obtained in somewhat the same\r\nmanner by E.B. Wilson with the egg of Amphioxus, by Zoja with the egg of\r\nMedusae, &c. It thus became very probable that an inequality of nuclear\r\ndivision could not be the basis of differentiation. The following\r\nexperiments were still more fatal to the theories of Roux and of\r\nWeismann. Driesch found that even when the first eight or sixteen cells\r\nof the cleaving egg of the sea-urchin were brought into quite abnormal\r\npositions with regard to one another, still a quite normal embryo was\r\ndeveloped; Driesch and T.H. Morgan discovered jointly that in the\r\nCtenophore egg one isolated blastomere developed into a half-embryo, but\r\nthat the same was the case if a portion of protoplasm was cut off from\r\nthe fertilized egg not yet in cleavage; last, but not of least\r\nimportance, in the case of the frog's egg which had been Roux's actual\r\nsubject of experiment, conditions were discovered by O. Schultze and O.\r\nHertwig under which one of the two first blastomeres of this egg\r\ndeveloped into a whole embryo of half size. This result was made still\r\nmore decisive by Morgan, who showed that it was quite in the power of\r\nthe experimenter to get either a half-embryo or a whole one of half\r\nsize, the latter dependent only upon giving to the blastomere the\r\nopportunity for a rearrangement of its matter by turning it over.\r\n\r\nThus we may say that the general result of the introductory series of\r\nexperiments in the physiology of development is the following:--In many\r\nforms, e.g. Echinoderms, Amphioxus, Ascidians, Fishes and Medusae, the\r\npotentiality (_prospective Potenz_--Driesch) of all the blastomeres of\r\nthe segmented egg is the same, i.e. each of them may play any or every\r\npart in the future development; the prospective value (_prosp.\r\nBedeutung_--D.) of each blastomere depends upon, or is a function of,\r\nits position in the whole of the segmented egg; we can term the \"whole\"\r\nof the egg after cleavage an \"aequipotential system\" (Driesch). But\r\nthough aequipotential, the whole of the segmented egg is nevertheless\r\nnot devoid of orientation or direction; the general law of causality\r\ncompels us to assume a general orientation of the smallest parts of the\r\negg, even in cases where we are not able to see it. It has been\r\nexperimentally proved that external stimuli (light, heat, pressure, &c.)\r\nare not responsible for the first differentiation of organs in the\r\nembryo; thus, should the segmented egg be absolutely equal in itself, it\r\nwould be incomprehensible that the first organs should be formed at one\r\nspecial point of it and not at another. Besides this general argument,\r\nwe see a sort of orientation in the typical forms of the polar or\r\nbilateral cleavage stages.\r\n\r\n  Differentiation, therefore, depends on a primary, i.e. innate,\r\n  orientation of the egg's plasma in those forms, the segmented eggs of\r\n  which represent aequipotential systems; this orientation is capable of\r\n  a sort of regulation or restoration after disturbances of any sort; in\r\n  the egg of the Ctenophora such a regulation is not possible, and in\r\n  the frog's egg it is facultative, i.e. possible under certain\r\n  conditions, but impossible under others. Should this interpretation be\r\n  right, the difference between the eggs of different animals would not\r\n  be so great as it seemed at first: differences with regard to the\r\n  potentialities of the blastomeres would only be differences with\r\n  regard to the capability of regulation or restoration of the egg's\r\n  protoplasm.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of physiological embryology being laid, we now can\r\nshortly deal with the whole series of special problems offered to us by\r\na general analysis of that science, but at present worked out only to a\r\nvery small extent.\r\n\r\n  We may ask the following questions:--What are the general conditions\r\n  of development? On what general factors does it depend? How do the\r\n  different organs of the partly developed embryo stand with regard to\r\n  their future fate? What are the stimuli (_Reize_) effecting\r\n  differentiation? What is to be said about the specific character of\r\n  the different formative effects? And as the most important question of\r\n  all: Are all the problems offered to us in the physiology of\r\n  development to be solved with the aid of the laws known hitherto in\r\n  science, or do we want specifically new \"vitalistic\" factors?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Conditions of differentiation.\r\n\r\nEnergy in different forms is required for development, and is provided\r\nby the surrounding medium. Light, though of no influence on the cleavage\r\n(Driesch), has a great effect on later stages of development, and is\r\nalso necessary for the formation of polyps in Eudendrium (J. Loeb). That\r\na certain temperature is necessary for ontogeny has long been known;\r\nthis was carefully studied by O. Hertwig, as was also the influence of\r\nheat on the rate of development. Oxygen is also wanted, either from a\r\ncertain stage of development or from the very beginning of it, though\r\nvery nearly related forms differ in this respect (Loeb). The great\r\ninfluence of osmotic pressure on growth was studied by J. Loeb, C.\r\nHerbst and C.H. Davenport. In all these cases energy may be necessary\r\nfor development in general, or a specific form of energy may be\r\nnecessary for the formation of a specific organ; it is clear that,\r\nespecially in the latter case, energy is shown to be a proper factor for\r\nmorphogenesis. Besides energy, a certain chemical condition of the\r\nmedium, whether offered by the water in which the egg lives or\r\n(especially in later stages) by the food, is of great importance for\r\nnormal ontogeny; the only careful study in this respect was carried out\r\nby Herbst for the development of the egg of Echinids. This investigator\r\nhas shown that all salts of the sea water are of great importance for\r\ndevelopment, and most of them specifically and typically; for instance,\r\ncalcium is absolutely necessary for holding together the embryonic\r\ncells, and without calcium all cells will fall apart, though they do not\r\ndie, but live to develop further.\r\n\r\nWhat we have dealt with may be called external factors of development;\r\nas to their complement, the internal factors, it is clear that every\r\nelementary factor of general physiology may be regarded as one of them.\r\nChemical metamorphosis plays, of course, a great part in\r\ndifferentiation, especially in the form of secretions; but very little\r\nhas been carefully studied in this respect. Movement of living matter,\r\nwhether of cells or of intracellular substance, is another important\r\nfactor (O. Butschli, F. Dreyer, L. Rhumbler.) Cell-division is another,\r\nits differences in direction, rate and quantity being of great\r\nimportance for differentiation. We know very little about it; a\r\nso-called law of O. Hertwig, that a cell would divide at right angles to\r\nits longest diameter, though experimentally stated in some cases, does\r\nnot hold for all, and the only thing we can say is, that the unknown\r\nprimary organization of the egg is here responsible. (Compare the papers\r\non \"cell-lineage\" of E.B. Wilson, F.R. Lillie, H.S. Jennings, O.\r\nZurstrassen and others.) Of the inner factors of ontogeny there is\r\nanother category that may be called physical, that already spoken of\r\nbeing physiological. The most important of these is the capillarity of\r\nthe cell surfaces. Berthold was the first to call attention to its role\r\nin the arrangement of cell composites, and afterwards the matter was\r\nmore carefully studied by Dreyer, Driesch, and especially W. Roux, with\r\nthe result that the arrangement of cells follows the principle of\r\nsurfaces _minimae areae_ (Plateau) as much as is reconcilable with the\r\nconditions of the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Potentialities of embryonic cells.\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that in many cases the embryo after cleavage,\r\ni.e. the blastula, is an \"aequipotential system.\" It was shown that in\r\nthe egg of Echinids there existed such an absolute lack of determination\r\nof the cleavage cells that (a) the cells may be put in quite abnormal\r\npositions with reference to one another without disturbing development;\r\n(b) a quarter blastomere gives a quite normal little pluteus, even a\r\nsixteenth yields a gastrula; (c) two eggs may fuse in the early blastula\r\nstage, giving one single normal embryo of double size. Our next question\r\nconcerns the distribution of potentiality, when the embryo is developed\r\nfurther than the blastula stage. In this case it has been shown that the\r\npotentialities of the different embryonic organs are different: that,\r\nfor instance, in Echinoderms or Amphibians the ectoderm, when isolated,\r\nis not able to form endoderm, and so on (Driesch, D. Barfurth); but it\r\nhas been shown at the same time that the ectoderm in itself, the\r\nintestine in itself of Echinoderms (Driesch), the medullary plate in\r\nitself of Triton (H. Spemann), is as aequipotential as was the blastula:\r\nthat any part whatever of these organs may be taken away without\r\ndisturbing the development of the rest into a normal and proportional\r\nembryonic part, except for its smaller size.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Formative stimuli.\r\n\r\nIf the single phases of differentiation are to be regarded as effects,\r\nwe must ask for the causes, or stimuli, of these effects. For a full\r\naccount of the subject we refer to Herbst, by whom also the whole\r\nbotanical literature, much more important than the zoological, is\r\ncritically reviewed. We have already seen that when the blastula\r\nrepresents an aequipotential system, there must be some sort of primary\r\norganization of the egg, recoverable after disturbances, that directs\r\nand localizes the formation of the first embryonic organs; we do not\r\nknow much about this organization. Directive stimuli (_Richtungsreize_)\r\nplay a great role in ontogeny; Herbst has analysed many cases where\r\ntheir existence is probable. They have been experimentally proved in two\r\ncases. The chromatic cells of the yolk sac of Fundulus are attracted by\r\nthe oxygen of the arteriae (Loeb); the mesenchyme cells of Echinus are\r\nattracted by some specific parts of the ectoderm, for they move towards\r\nthem also when removed from their original positions to any point of the\r\nblastocoel by shaking (Driesch). Many directive stimuli might be\r\ndiscovered by a careful study of grafting experiments, such as have been\r\nmade by Born, Joest, Harrison and others, but at present these\r\nexperiments have not been carried out far enough to get exact results.\r\n\r\nFormative stimuli in a narrower meaning of the word, i.e. stimuli\r\naffecting the origin of embryonic organs, have long been known in\r\nbotany; in zoology we know (especially from Loeb) a good deal about the\r\ninfluence of light, gravitation, contact, &c., on the formation of\r\norgans in hydroids, but these forms are very plant-like in many\r\nrespects; as to free-living animals, Herbst proved that the formation of\r\nthe arms of the pluteus larva depends on the existence of the calcareous\r\ntetrahedra, and made in other cases (lens of vertebrate eye, nerves and\r\nmuscles, &c.) the existence of formative stimuli very probable. Many of\r\nthe facts generally known as functional adaptation (_functionelle\r\nAnpassung_--Roux) in botany and zoology may also belong to this\r\ncategory, i.e. be the effects of some external stimulus, but they are\r\nfar from having been analysed in a satisfactory manner. That the\r\nstructure of parts of the vertebrate skeleton is always in relation to\r\ntheir function, even under abnormal conditions, is well known; what is\r\nthe real \"cause\" of differentiation in this case is difficult to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Specific characters.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that we cannot answer the question why the different\r\nontogenetic effects are just what they are. Developmental physiology\r\ntakes the specific nature of form for granted, and it may be left for a\r\nreally rational theory of the evolution of species in the future to\r\nanswer the problem of species, as far as it is answerable at all. What\r\nwe intend to do here is only to say in a few words wherein consists the\r\nspecific character of embryonic organs. That embryonic parts are\r\nspecific or typical in regard to their protoplasm is obvious, and is\r\nwell proved by the fact that the different parts of the embryo react\r\ndifferently to the same chemical or other reagents (Herbst, Loeb). That\r\nthey may be typical also in regard to their nuclei was shown by Boveri\r\nfor the generative cells of Ascaris; we are not able at present to say\r\nanything definite about the importance of this fact. The specific nature\r\nof an embryonic organ consists to a high degree in the number of cells\r\ncomposing it; it was shown for many cases that this number, and also the\r\nsize of cells, is constant under constant conditions, and that under\r\ninconstant conditions the number is variable, the size constant; for\r\ninstance, embryos which have developed from one of the two first\r\nblastomeres show only half the normal number of cells in their organs\r\n(Morgan, Driesch).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Self-differentiation.\r\n\r\nWe have learnt that the successive steps of embryonic development are to\r\nbe regarded as effects, caused by stimuli, which partly exist in the\r\nembryo itself. But it must be noted that not every part of the embryo is\r\ndependent on every other one, but that there exists a great independence\r\nof the parts, to a varying degree in every case. This partial independence\r\nhas been called self-differentiation (_Selbstdifferenzierung_) by Roux,\r\nand is certainly a characteristic feature of ontogeny. At the same time it\r\nmust not be forgotten that the word is only relative, and that it only\r\nexpresses our recognition of a negation.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we know that the ectoderm of Echinus may develop further\r\nif the endoderm is taken away; in other words, that it develops by\r\nself-differentiation in regard to the endoderm, that its differentiation\r\nis not dependent on the endoderm; but it would be obviously more\r\nimportant to know the factors on which this differentiation is actually\r\ndependent than to know one factor on which it is not. The same is true\r\nfor all other experiments on \"self-differentiation,\" whether analytical\r\n(Loeb, Schaper, Driesch) or not (grafting experiments, Born, Joest,\r\n&c.).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Vitalism.\r\n\r\nCan we understand differentiation by means of the laws of natural\r\nphenomena offered to us by physics and chemistry? Most people would say\r\nyes, though not yet. Driesch has tried to show that we are absolutely\r\nnot able to understand development, at any rate one part of it, i.e. the\r\nlocalization of the various successive steps of differentiation. But it\r\nis impossible to give any idea of this argument in a few words, and we\r\ncan only say here that it is based on the experiments upon isolated\r\nblastomeres, &c., and on an analysis of the character of aequipotential\r\nsystems. In this way physiology of development would lead us straight on\r\ninto vitalism.\r\n\r\n  REFERENCES.--An account of the subject, with full literature, is given\r\n  by H.

It is enough,\r\n    however, to say that Fabricius was entirely ignorant of the earlier\r\n    phenomena of development which occur in the first two or three days,\r\n    and even of the source of the embryonic rudiments, which he conceived\r\n    to spring, not from the yolk or true ovum, but from the chalazae or\r\n    twisted, deepest part of the white. The cicatricula he looked upon as\r\n    merely the vestige of the pedicle by which the yolk had previously\r\n    been attached to the ovary.\r\n\r\n  [3] Along with the work of W. Hunter must be mentioned a large\r\n    collection of unpublished observations by Dr James Douglas, which are\r\n    preserved in the Hunterian Museum of Glasgow University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMDEN, a maritime town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Hanover,\r\nnear the mouth of the Ems, 49 m. N.W. from Oldenburg by rail. Pop.\r\n(1885) 14,019; (1905) 20,754. The Ems once flowed beneath its walls, but\r\nis now 2 m. distant, and connected with the town by a broad and deep\r\ncanal, divided into the inner (or dock) harbour and the outer (or \"free\r\nport\") harbour. The latter is 3/4 m. in length, has a breadth of nearly\r\n400 ft., and since the construction of the Ems-Jade and Dortmund-Ems\r\ncanals, has been deepened to 38 ft., thus allowing the largest sea-going\r\nvessels to approach its wharves. The town is intersected by canals\r\n(crossed by numerous bridges), which bring it into communication with\r\nmost of the towns in East Friesland, of which it is the commercial\r\ncapital. The waterways which traverse and surround it and the character\r\nof its numerous gabled medieval houses give it the appearance of an old\r\nDutch, rather than of a German, town. Of its churches the most\r\nnoteworthy are the Reformed \"Great Church\" (Grosse Kirche), a large\r\nGothic building completed in 1455, containing the tomb of Enno II. (d.\r\n1540), count of East Friesland; the Gasthauskirche, formerly the church\r\nof a Franciscan friary founded in 1317; and the Neue Kirche (1643-1647).\r\nOf its secular buildings, the Rathaus (town-hall), built in 1574-1576,\r\non the model of that of Antwerp, with a lofty tower, and containing an\r\ninteresting collection of arms and armour, is particularly remarkable.\r\nThere are numerous educational institutions, including classical and\r\nmodern schools, and schools of commerce, navigation and telegraphy. The\r\ntown has two interesting museums. Emden is the seat of an active trade\r\nin agricultural produce and live-stock, horses, timber, coal, tea and\r\nwine. The deep-sea fishing industry of the town is important, the\r\nfishing fleet in 1902 numbering 67 vessels. Machinery, cement, cordage,\r\nwire ropes, tobacco, leather, &c. are manufactured. Emden is also of\r\nimportance as the station of the submarine cables connecting Germany\r\nwith England, North America and Spain. It has a regular steamboat\r\nservice with Borkum and Norderney.\r\n\r\nEmden (Emuden, Emetha) is first mentioned in the 12th century, when it\r\nwas the capital of the Eemsgo (Emsgau, or county of the Ems), one of the\r\nthree hereditary countships into which East Friesland had been divided\r\nby the emperor. In 1252 the countship was sold to the bishops of\r\nMunster; but their rule soon became little more than nominal, and in\r\nEmden itself the family of Abdena, the episcopal provosts and\r\ncastellans, established their practical independence. Towards the end of\r\nthe 14th century the town gained a considerable trade owing to the\r\npermission given by the provost to the pirates known as\r\n\"Viktualienbruder\" to make it their market, after they had been driven\r\nout of Gothland by the Teutonic Order. In 1402, after the defeat of the\r\npirates off Heligoland by the fleet of Hamburg, Emden was besieged, but\r\nit was not reduced by Hamburg, with the aid of Edzard Cirksena of\r\nGreetsyl, until 1431. The town was held jointly by its captors till\r\n1453, when Hamburg sold its rights to Ulrich Cirksena, created count of\r\nEast Friesland by the emperor Frederick III. in 1454. In 1544 the\r\nReformation was introduced, and in the following years numerous\r\nProtestant refugees from the Low Countries found their way to the town.\r\nIn 1595 Emden became a free imperial city under the protection of\r\nHolland, and was occupied by a Dutch garrison until 1744 when, with East\r\nFriesland, it was transferred to Prussia. In 1810 Emden became the chief\r\ntown of the French department of Ems Oriental; in 1815 it was assigned\r\nto Hanover, and in 1866 was annexed with that kingdom by Prussia.\r\n\r\n  See Furbringer, _Die Stadt Emden in Gegenwart und Vergangenheit_\r\n  (Emden, 1892).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERALD, a bright green variety of beryl, much valued as a gem-stone.\r\nThe word comes indirectly from the Gr. [Greek: _smaragdos_] (Arabic\r\n_zumurrud_), but this seems to have been a name vaguely given to a\r\nnumber of stones having little in common except a green colour. Pliny's\r\n\"smaragdus\" undoubtedly included several distinct species. Much\r\nconfusion has arisen with respect to the \"emerald\" of the Scriptures.\r\nThe Hebrew word _nophek_, rendered emerald in the Authorized Version,\r\nprobably meant the carbuncle: it is indeed translated [Greek: _anthrax_]\r\nin the Septuagint, and a marginal reading in the Revised Version gives\r\ncarbuncle. On the other hand, the word _bareqath_, rendered [Greek:\r\n_smaragdos_] in the LXX., appears in the A.V. as carbuncle, with the\r\nalternative reading of emerald in the R.V. It may have referred to the\r\ntrue emerald, but Flinders Petrie suggests that it meant rock-crystal.\r\n\r\nThe properties of emerald are mostly the same as those described under\r\nBERYL. The crystals often show simply the hexagonal prism and basal\r\nplane. The prisms cleave, though imperfectly, at right angles to the\r\ngeometrical axis; and hexagonal slices were formerly worn in the East.\r\nCompared with most gems, the emerald is rather soft, its hardness (7.5)\r\nbeing but slightly above that of quartz. The specific gravity is low,\r\nvarying slightly in stones from different localities, but being for the\r\nMuzo emerald about 2.67. The refractive and dispersive powers are not\r\nhigh, so that the cut stones display little brilliancy or \"fire.\" The\r\nemerald is dichroic, giving in the dichroscope a bluish-green and a\r\nyellowish-green image. The magnificent colour which gives extraordinary\r\nvalue to this gem, is probably due to chromium. F. Wohler found 0.186%\r\nof Cr2O3 in the emerald of Muzo,--a proportion which, though small, is\r\nsufficient to impart an emerald-green colour to glass. The stone loses\r\ncolour when strongly heated, and M. Lewy suggested that the colour was\r\ndue to an organic pigment. Greville Williams showed that emeralds lost\r\nabout 9% of their weight on fusion, the specific gravity being reduced\r\nto about 2.4.\r\n\r\nThe ancients appear to have obtained the emerald from Upper Egypt, where\r\nit is said to have been worked as early as 1650 B.C. It is known that\r\nGreek miners were at work in the time of Alexander the Great, and in\r\nlater times the mines yielded their gems to Cleopatra. Remains of\r\nextensive workings were discovered in the northern Etbai by the French\r\ntraveller, F. Cailliaud, in 1817, and the mines were re-opened for a\r\nshort time under Mehemet Ali. \"Cleopatra's Mines\" are situated in Jebel\r\nSikait and Jebel Zabara near the Red Sea coast east of Assuan. They were\r\nvisited in 1891 by E.A. Floyer, and the Sikait workings were explored in\r\n1900 by D.A. MacAlister and others. The Egyptian emeralds occur in\r\nmica-schist and talc-schist.\r\n\r\nOn the Spanish conquest of South America vast quantities of emeralds\r\nwere taken from the Peruvians, but the exact locality which yielded the\r\nstones was never discovered. The only South American emeralds now known\r\noccur near Bogota, the capital of Colombia. The most famous mine is at\r\nMuzo, but workings are known also at Coscuez and Somondoco. The emerald\r\noccurs in nests of calcite in a black bituminous limestone containing\r\nammonites of Lower Cretaceous age. The mineral is associated with\r\nquartz, dolomite, pyrites, and the rare mineral called \"parisite\"--a\r\nfluo-carbonate of the cerium metals, occurring in brownish-yellow\r\nhexagonal crystals, and named after J.J. Paris, who worked the emeralds.\r\nIt has been suggested that the Colombian emerald is not in its original\r\nmatrix. The fine stones are called _canutillos_ and the inferior ones\r\n_morallion_.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 emeralds were accidentally discovered in the Ural Mountains. At\r\nthe present time they are worked on the river Takovaya, about 60 m. N.E.\r\nof Ekaterinburg, where they occur in mica-schist, associated with\r\naquamarine, alexandrite, phenacite, &c. Emerald is found also in\r\nmica-schist in the Habachthal, in the Salzburg Alps, and in granite at\r\nEidsvold in Norway. Emerald has been worked in a vein of pegmatite,\r\npiercing slaty rocks, near Emmaville, in New South Wales. The crystals\r\noccurred in association with topaz, fluorspar and cassiterite; but they\r\nwere mostly of rather pale colour. In the United States, emerald has\r\noccasionally been found, and fine crystals have been obtained from the\r\nworkings for hiddenite at Stonypoint, Alexander county, N.C.\r\n\r\nMany virtues were formerly ascribed to the emerald. When worn, it was\r\nheld to be a preservative against epilepsy, it cured dysentery, it\r\nassisted women in childbirth, it drove away evil spirits, and preserved\r\nthe chastity of the wearer. Administered internally it was reputed to\r\nhave great medicinal value. In consequence of its refreshing green\r\ncolour it was naturally said to be good for the eyesight.\r\n\r\nThe stone known as \"Oriental emerald\" is a green corundum. Lithia\r\nemerald is the mineral called hiddenite; Uralian emerald is a name given\r\nto demantoid; Brazilian emerald is merely green tourmaline; evening\r\nemerald is the peridot; pyro-emerald is fluorspar which phosphoresces\r\nwith a green glow when heated; and \"mother of emerald\" is generally a\r\ngreen quartz or perhaps in some cases a green felspar.\r\n\r\n  See AQUAMARINE, BERYL.

He soon returned, however, to his native\r\nvillage, and followed for some time the profession of an advocate; but\r\nin 1787 he succeeded his uncle Antoine David as printer to the\r\nparlement. He was elected mayor of Aix in 1791; and although he speedily\r\nresigned his office, he was in 1793 threatened with arrest, and had for\r\nsome time to adopt a vagrant life. When danger was past he returned to\r\nAix, sold his printing business, and engaged in general commercial\r\npursuits; but he was not long in renouncing these also, in order to\r\ndevote himself exclusively to literature and art. From 1809 to 1814,\r\nunder the Empire, he represented his department in the Lower House\r\n(_Corps legislatif_); in 1814 he voted for the downfall of Napoleon; in\r\n1815 he retired into private life, and in 1816 he was elected a member\r\nof the Institute. He died in Paris on the 2nd of April 1839.\r\nEmeric-David was placed in 1825 on the commission appointed to continue\r\n_L'Histoire litteraire de la France._ His principal works are\r\n_Recherches sur l'art statuaire, considere chez les anciens et les\r\nmodernes_ (Paris, 1805), a work which obtained the prize of the\r\nInstitute; _Suite d'etudes calquees et dessinees d'apres cinq tableaux\r\nde Raphael_ (Paris, 1818-1821), in 6 vols. fol.; _Jupiter, ou recherches\r\nsur ce dieu, sur son culte_, &c. (Paris, 1833), 2 vols. 8vo,\r\nillustrated; and _Vulcain_ (Paris, 1837).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERITUS (Lat. from _emereri_, to serve out one's time, to earn\r\nthoroughly), a term used of Roman soldiers and public officials who had\r\nearned their discharge from the service, a veteran, and hence applied,\r\nin modern times, to a university professor (_professor emeritus_) who\r\nhas vacated his chair, on account of long service, age or infirmity,\r\nand, in the Presbyterian church, to a minister who has for like reason\r\ngiven up his charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERSON, RALPH WALDO (1803-1882), American poet and essayist, was born\r\nin Boston, Massachusetts, on the 25th of May 1803. Seven of his\r\nancestors were ministers of New England churches. Among them were some\r\nof those men of mark who made the backbone of the American character:\r\nthe sturdy Puritan, Peter Bulkeley, sometime rector of Odell in\r\nBedfordshire, and afterward pastor of the church in the wilderness at\r\nConcord, New Hampshire; the zealous evangelist, Father Samuel Moody of\r\nAgamenticus in Maine, who pursued graceless sinners even into the\r\nalehouse; Joseph Emerson of Malden, \"a heroic scholar,\" who prayed every\r\nnight that no descendant of his might ever be rich; and William Emerson\r\nof Concord, Mass., the patriot preacher, who died while serving in the\r\narmy of the Revolution. Sprung from such stock, Emerson inherited\r\nqualities of self-reliance, love of liberty, strenuous virtue,\r\nsincerity, sobriety and fearless loyalty to ideals. The form of his\r\nideals was modified by the metamorphic glow of Transcendentalism which\r\npassed through the region of Boston in the second quarter of the 19th\r\ncentury. But the spirit in which Emerson conceived the laws of life,\r\nreverenced them and lived them out, was the Puritan spirit, elevated,\r\nenlarged and beautified by the poetic temperament.\r\n\r\nHis father was the Rev. William Emerson, minister of the First Church\r\n(Unitarian) in Boston. Ralph Waldo was the fourth child in a family of\r\neight, of whom at least three gave evidence of extraordinary mental\r\npowers. He was brought up in an atmosphere of hard work, of moral\r\ndiscipline, and (after his father's death in 1811) of that wholesome\r\nself-sacrifice which is a condition of life for those who are poor in\r\nmoney and rich in spirit. His aunt, Miss Mary Moody Emerson, a brilliant\r\nold maid, an eccentric saint, was a potent factor in his education.\r\nLoving him, believing in his powers, passionately desiring for him a\r\nsuccessful career, but clinging with both hands to the old forms of\r\nfaith from which he floated away, this solitary, intense woman did as\r\nmuch as any one to form, by action and reaction, the mind and character\r\nof the young Emerson. In 1817 he entered Harvard College, and graduated\r\nin 1821. In scholarship he ranked about the middle of his class. In\r\nliterature and oratory he was more distinguished, receiving a Boylston\r\nprize for declamation, and two Bowdoin prizes for dissertations, the\r\nfirst essay being on \"The Character of Socrates\" and the second on \"The\r\nPresent State of Ethical Philosophy\"--both rather dull, formal, didactic\r\nproductions. He was fond of reading and of writing verse, and was chosen\r\nas the poet for class-day. His cheerful serenity of manner, his tranquil\r\nmirthfulness, and the steady charm of his personality made him a\r\nfavourite with his fellows, in spite of a certain reserve. His literary\r\ntaste was conventional, including the standard British writers, with a\r\npreference for Shakespeare among the poets, Berkeley among the\r\nphilosophers, and Montaigne (in Cotton's translation) among the\r\nessayists. His particular admiration among the college professors was\r\nthe stately rhetorician, Edward Everett; and this predilection had much\r\nto do with his early ambition to be a professor of rhetoric and\r\nelocution.\r\n\r\nImmediately after graduation he became an assistant in his brother\r\nWilliam's school for young ladies in Boston, and continued teaching,\r\nwith much inward reluctance and discomfort, for three years. The routine\r\nwas distasteful; he despised the superficial details which claimed so\r\nmuch of his time. The bonds of conventionalism were silently dissolving\r\nin the rising glow of his poetic nature. Independence, sincerity,\r\nreality, grew more and more necessary to him. His aunt urged him to seek\r\nretirement, self-reliance, friendship with nature; to be no longer \"the\r\nnursling of surrounding circumstances,\" but to prepare a celestial abode\r\nfor the muse. The passion for spiritual leadership stirred within him.\r\nThe ministry seemed to offer the fairest field for its satisfaction. In\r\n1825 he entered the divinity school at Cambridge, to prepare himself for\r\nthe Unitarian pulpit. His course was much interrupted by ill-health. His\r\nstudies were irregular, and far more philosophical and literary than\r\ntheological.\r\n\r\nIn October 1826 he was \"approbated to preach\" by the Middlesex\r\nAssociation of Ministers. The same year a threatened consumption\r\ncompelled him to take a long journey in the south. Returning in 1827, he\r\ncontinued his studies, preached as a candidate in various churches, and\r\nimproved in health. In 1829 he married a beautiful but delicate young\r\nwoman, Miss Ellen Tucker of Concord, and was installed as associate\r\nminister of the Second Church (Unitarian) in Boston. The retirement of\r\nhis senior colleague soon left him the sole pastor. Emerson's early\r\nsermons were simple, direct, unconventional. He dealt freely with the\r\nthings of the spirit. There was a homely elevation in his discourses, a\r\nnatural freshness in his piety, a quiet enthusiasm in his manner, that\r\ncharmed thoughtful hearers. Early in 1832 he lost his wife, a sorrow\r\nthat deeply depressed him in health and spirits. Following his passion\r\nfor independence and sincerity, he arrived at the conviction that the\r\nLord's Supper was not intended by Christ to be a permanent sacrament. To\r\nhim, at least, it had become an outgrown form. He was willing to\r\ncontinue the service only if the use of the elements should be dropped\r\nand the rite made simply an act of spiritual remembrance. Setting forth\r\nthese views, candidly and calmly, in a sermon, he found his\r\ncongregation, not unnaturally, reluctant to agree with him, and\r\ntherefore retired, not without some disappointment, from the pastoral\r\noffice. He never again took charge of a parish; but he continued to\r\npreach, as opportunity offered, until 1847. In fact, he was always a\r\npreacher, though of a singular order. His supreme task was to befriend\r\nand guide the inner life of man.\r\n\r\nThe strongest influences in his development about this time were the\r\nliberating philosophy of Coleridge, the mystical visions of Swedenborg,\r\nthe intimate poetry of Wordsworth, and the stimulating essays of\r\nCarlyle. On Christmas Day 1832 he took passage in a sailing vessel for\r\nthe Mediterranean. He travelled through Italy, visited Paris, spent two\r\nmonths in Scotland and England, and saw the four men whom he most\r\ndesired to see--Landor, Coleridge, Carlyle and Wordsworth. \"The comfort\r\nof meeting such men of genius as these,\" he wrote, \"is that they talk\r\nsincerely.\" But he adds that he found all four of them, in different\r\ndegrees, deficient in insight into religious truth. His visit to\r\nCarlyle, in the lonely farm-house at Craigenputtock, was the memorable\r\nbeginning of a lifelong friendship. Emerson published Carlyle's first\r\nbooks in America. Carlyle introduced Emerson's Essays into England. The\r\ntwo men were bound together by a mutual respect deeper than a sympathy\r\nof tastes, and a community of spirit stronger than a similarity of\r\nopinions. Emerson was a sweet-tempered Carlyle, living in the sunshine.\r\nCarlyle was a militant Emerson, moving amid thunderclouds. The things\r\nthat each most admired in the other were self-reliance, directness,\r\nmoral courage. A passage in Emerson's Diary, written on his homeward\r\nvoyage, strikes the keynote of his remaining life. \"A man contains all\r\nthat is needful to his government within himself.... All real good or\r\nevil that can befall him must be from himself.... There is a\r\ncorrespondence between the human soul and everything that exists in the\r\nworld; more properly, everything that is known to man. Instead of\r\nstudying things without, the principles of them all may be penetrated\r\ninto within him.... The purpose of life seems to be to acquaint man with\r\nhimself.... The highest revelation is that God is in every man.\" Here is\r\nthe essence of that intuitional philosophy, commonly called\r\nTranscendentalism. Emerson disclaimed allegiance to that philosophy. He\r\ncalled it \"the saturnalia, or excess of faith.\" His practical common\r\nsense recoiled from the amazing conclusions which were drawn from it by\r\nmany of its more eccentric advocates. His independence revolted against\r\nbeing bound to any scheme or system of doctrine, however nebulous. He\r\nsaid: \"I wish to say what I feel and think to-day, with the proviso that\r\nto-morrow perhaps I shall contradict it all.\" But this very wish commits\r\nhim to the doctrine of the inner light. All through his life he\r\nnavigated the Transcendental sea, piloted by a clear moral sense, warned\r\noff the rocks by the saving grace of humour, and kept from capsizing by\r\na good ballast of New England prudence.\r\n\r\nAfter his return from England in 1833 he went to live with his mother at\r\nthe old manse in Concord, Mass., and began his career as a lecturer in\r\nBoston. His first discourses were delivered before the Society of\r\nNatural History and the Mechanics' Institute. They were chiefly on\r\nscientific subjects, approached in a poetic spirit. In the autumn of\r\n1835 he married Miss Lydia Jackson of Plymouth, having previously\r\npurchased a spacious old house and garden at Concord. There he spent the\r\nremainder of his life, a devoted husband, a wise and tender father, a\r\ncareful house-holder, a virtuous villager, a friendly neighbour, and,\r\nspite of all his disclaimers, the central and luminous figure among the\r\nTranscendentalists. The doctrine which in others seemed to produce all\r\nsorts of extravagances--communistic experiments at Brook Farm and\r\nFruitlands, weird schemes of political reform, long hair on men and\r\nshort hair on women--in his sane, well-balanced nature served only to\r\nlend an ideal charm to the familiar outline of a plain, orderly New\r\nEngland life. Some mild departures from established routine he\r\ntranquilly tested and as tranquilly abandoned. He tried vegetarianism\r\nfor a while, but gave it up when he found that it did him no particular\r\ngood. An attempt to illustrate household equality by having the servants\r\nsit at table with the rest of the family was frustrated by the dislike\r\nof his two sensible domestics for such an inconvenient arrangement. His\r\ntheory that manual labour should form part of the scholar's life was\r\nchecked by the personal discovery that hard labour in the fields meant\r\npoor work in the study. \"The writer shall not dig,\" was his practical\r\nconclusion. Intellectual independence was what he chiefly desired; and\r\nthis, he found, could be attained in a manner of living not outwardly\r\ndifferent from that of the average college professor or country\r\nminister. And yet it was to this property-holding, debt-paying,\r\nlaw-abiding, well-dressed, courteous-mannered citizen of Concord that\r\nthe ardent and enthusiastic turned as the prophet of the new idealism.\r\nThe influence of other Transcendental teachers, Dr Hedge, Dr Ripley,\r\nBronson Alcott, Orestes Brownson, Theodore Parker, Margaret Fuller,\r\nHenry Thoreau, Jones Very, was narrow and parochial compared with that\r\nof Emerson. Something in his imperturbable, kindly presence, his angelic\r\nlook, his musical voice, his commanding style of thought and speech,\r\nannounced him as the possessor of the great secret which many were\r\nseeking--the secret of a freer, deeper, more harmonious life. More and\r\nmore, as his fame spread, those who \"would live in the spirit\" came to\r\nlisten to the voice, and to sit at the feet, of the Sage of Concord.\r\n\r\nIt was on the lecture-platform that he found his power and won his fame.\r\nThe courses of lectures that he delivered at the Masonic Temple in\r\nBoston, during the winters of 1835 and 1836, on \"Great Men,\" \"English\r\nLiterature,\" and \"The Philosophy of History,\" were well attended and\r\nadmired. They were followed by two discourses which commanded for him\r\nimmediate recognition, part friendly and part hostile, as a new and\r\npotent personality. His Phi Beta Kappa oration at Harvard College in\r\nAugust 1837, on \"The American Scholar,\" was an eloquent appeal for\r\nindependence, sincerity, realism, in the intellectual life of America.\r\nHis address before the graduating class of the divinity school at\r\nCambridge, in 1838, was an impassioned protest against what he called\r\n\"the defects of historical Christianity\" (its undue reliance upon the\r\npersonal authority of Jesus, and its failure to explore the moral nature\r\nof man as the fountain of established teaching), and a daring plea for\r\nabsolute self-reliance and a new inspiration of religion. \"In the soul,\"\r\nhe said, \"let redemption be sought. Wherever a man comes, there comes\r\nrevolution. The old is for slaves. Go alone. Refuse the good models,\r\neven those which are sacred in the imagination of men. Cast conformity\r\nbehind you, and acquaint men at first hand with Deity.\" In this address\r\nEmerson laid his hand on the sensitive point of Unitarianism, which\r\nrejected the divinity of Jesus, but held fast to his supreme authority.\r\nA blaze of controversy sprang up at once. Conservatives attacked him;\r\nRadicals defended him. Emerson made no reply. But amid this somewhat\r\nfierce illumination he went forward steadily as a public lecturer. It\r\nwas not his negations that made him popular; it was the eloquence with\r\nwhich he presented the positive side of his doctrine. Whatever the\r\ntitles of his discourses, \"Literary Ethics,\" \"Man the Reformer,\" \"The\r\nPresent Age,\" \"The Method of Nature,\" \"Representative Men,\" \"The Conduct\r\nof Life,\" their theme was always the same, namely, \"the infinitude of\r\nthe private man.\" Those who thought him astray on the subject of\r\nreligion listened to him with delight when he poetized the commonplaces\r\nof art, politics, literature or the household. His utterance was\r\nDelphic, inspirational. There was magic in his elocution. The simplicity\r\nand symmetry of his sentences, the modulations of his thrilling voice,\r\nthe radiance of his fine face, even his slight hesitations and pauses\r\nover his manuscript, lent a strange charm to his speech. For more than a\r\ngeneration he went about the country lecturing in cities, towns and\r\nvillages, before learned societies, rustic lyceums and colleges; and\r\nthere was no man on the platform in America who excelled him in\r\ndistinction, in authority, or in stimulating eloquence.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 Emerson visited Great Britain for the second time, was welcomed\r\nby Carlyle, lectured to appreciative audiences in Manchester, Liverpool,\r\nEdinburgh and London, made many new friends among the best English\r\npeople, paid a brief visit to Paris, and returned home in July 1848. \"I\r\nleave England,\" he wrote, \"with increased respect for the Englishman.\r\nHis stuff or substance seems to be the best in the world. I forgive him\r\nall his pride. My respect is the more generous that I have no sympathy\r\nwith him, only an admiration.\" The impressions of this journey were\r\nembodied in a book called _English Traits_, published in 1856. It might\r\nbe called \"English Traits and American Confessions,\" for nowhere does\r\nEmerson's Americanism come out more strongly. But the America that he\r\nloved and admired was the ideal, the potential America. For the actual\r\nconditions of social and political life in his own time he had a fine\r\nscorn. He was an intellectual Brahmin. His principles were democratic,\r\nhis tastes aristocratic. He did not like crowds, streets, hotels--\"the\r\npeople who fill them oppress me with their excessive civility.\" Humanity\r\nwas his hero. He loved man, but be was not fond of men. He had grave\r\ndoubts about universal suffrage. He took a sincere interest in social\r\nand political reform, but towards specific \"reforms\" his attitude was\r\nsomewhat remote and visionary. On the subject of temperance he held\r\naloof from the intemperate methods of the violent prohibitionists. He\r\nwas a believer in woman's rights, but he was lukewarm towards\r\nconventions in favour of woman suffrage. Even in regard to slavery he\r\nhad serious hesitations about the ways of the abolitionists, and for a\r\nlong time refused to be identified with them. But as the irrepressible\r\nconflict drew to a head Emerson's hesitation vanished. He said in 1856,\r\n\"I think we must get rid of slavery, or we must get rid of freedom.\"\r\nWith the outbreak of the Civil War he became an ardent and powerful\r\nadvocate of the cause of the Union. James Russell Lowell said, \"To him\r\nmore than to all other causes did the young martyrs of our Civil War owe\r\nthe sustaining strength of thoughtful heroism that is so touching in\r\nevery record of their lives.\"\r\n\r\nEmerson the essayist was a condensation of Emerson the lecturer. His\r\nprose works, with the exception of the slender volume entitled _Nature_\r\n(1836), were collected and arranged from the manuscripts of his\r\nlectures. His method of writing was characteristic. He planted a subject\r\nin his mind, and waited for thoughts and illustrations to come to it, as\r\nbirds or insects to a plant or flower. When an idea appeared, he\r\nfollowed it, \"as a boy might hunt a butterfly\"; when it was captured he\r\npinned it in his \"Thought-book\". The writings of other men he used more\r\nfor stimulus than for guidance. He said that books were for the\r\nscholar's idle times. \"I value them,\" he said, \"to make my top spin.\"\r\nHis favourite reading was poetry and mystical philosophy: Shakespeare,\r\nDante, George Herbert, Goethe, Berkeley, Coleridge, Swedenborg, Jakob\r\nBoehme, Plato, the new Platonists, and the religious books of the East\r\n(in translation). Next to these he valued books of biography and\r\nanecdote: Plutarch, Grimm, St Simon, Varnhagen von Ense. He had some odd\r\ndislikes, and could find nothing in Aristophanes, Cervantes, Shelley,\r\nScott, Miss Austen, Dickens. Novels he seldom read. He was a follower of\r\nnone, an original borrower from all. His illustrations were drawn from\r\nnear and far. The zodiac of Denderah; the Savoyards who carved their\r\npine-forests into toys; the naked Derar, horsed on an idea, charging a\r\ntroop of Roman cavalry; the long, austere Pythagorean lustrum of\r\nsilence; Napoleon on the deck of the \"Bellerophon,\" observing the drill\r\nof the English soldiers; the Egyptian doctrine that every man has two\r\npairs of eyes; Empedocles and his shoe; the horizontal stratification of\r\nthe earth; a soft mushroom pushing its way through the hard\r\nground,--all these allusions and a thousand more are found in the same\r\nvolume. On his pages, close beside the Parthenon, the Sphinx, St Paul's,\r\nEtna and Vesuvius, you will find the White Mountains, Monadnock,\r\nAgiocochook, Katahdin, the pickerel-weed in bloom, the wild geese\r\nhonking through the sky, the chick-a-dee braving the snow, Wall Street\r\nand State Street, cotton-mills, railroads and Quincy granite. For an\r\nabstract thinker he was strangely in love with the concrete facts of\r\nlife. Idealism in him assumed the form of a vivid illumination of the\r\nreal. From the pages of his teeming note-books he took the material for\r\nhis lectures, arranging and rearranging it under such titles as Nature,\r\nSchool, Home, Genius, Beauty and Manners, Self-Possession, Duty, The\r\nSuperlative, Truth, The Anglo-Saxon, The Young American. When the\r\nlectures had served their purpose he rearranged the material in essays\r\nand published them. Thus appeared in succession the following volumes:\r\n_Essays_ (First Series) (1841); _Essays_ (Second Series) (1844);\r\n_Representative Men_ (1850); _English Traits_ (1856); _The Conduct of\r\nLife_ (1860); _Society and Solitude_ (1870); _Letters and Social Aims_\r\n(1876). Besides these, many other lectures were printed in separate form\r\nand in various combinations.\r\n\r\nEmerson's style is brilliant, epigrammatic, gem-like; clear in\r\nsentences, obscure in paragraphs. He was a sporadic observer. He saw by\r\nflashes. He said, \"I do not know what arguments mean in reference to any\r\nexpression of a thought.\" The coherence of his writing lies in his\r\npersonality. His work is fused by a steady glow of optimism. Yet he\r\nstates this optimism moderately. \"The genius which preserves and guides\r\nthe human race indicates itself by a small excess of good, a small\r\nbalance in brute facts always favourable to the side of reason.\"\r\n\r\nHis verse, though in form inferior to his prose, was perhaps a truer\r\nexpression of his genius. He said, \"I am born a poet\"; and again,\r\nwriting to Carlyle, he called himself \"half a bard.\" He had \"the\r\nvision,\" but not \"the faculty divine\" which translates the vision into\r\nmusic. In his two volumes of verse (_Poems_, 1846; _May Day and other\r\nPieces_, 1867) there are many passages of beautiful insight and profound\r\nfeeling, some lines of surprising splendour, and a few poems, like \"The\r\nRhodora,\" \"The Snowstorm,\" \"Ode to Beauty,\" \"Terminus,\" \"The Concord\r\nOde,\" and the marvellous \"Threnody\" on the death of his first-born boy,\r\nof beauty unmarred and penetrating truth. But the total value of his\r\npoetical work is discounted by the imperfection of metrical form, the\r\npresence of incongruous images, the predominance of the intellectual\r\nover the emotional element, and the lack of flow. It is the material of\r\npoetry not thoroughly worked out. But the genius from which it came--the\r\nswift faculty of perception, the lofty imagination, the idealizing\r\nspirit enamoured of reality--was the secret source of all Emerson's\r\ngreatness as a speaker and as a writer. Whatever verdict time may pass\r\nupon the bulk of his poetry, Emerson himself must be recognized as an\r\noriginal and true poet of a high order.\r\n\r\nHis latter years were passed in peaceful honour at Concord. In 1866\r\nHarvard College conferred upon him the degree of LL.D., and in 1867 he\r\nwas elected an overseer. In 1870 he delivered a course of lectures\r\nbefore the university on \"The Natural History of the Intellect.\" In 1872\r\nhis house was burned down, and was rebuilt by popular subscription. In\r\nthe same year he went on his third foreign journey, going as far as\r\nEgypt. About this time began a failure in his powers, especially in his\r\nmemory. But his character remained serene and unshaken in dignity.\r\nSteadily, tranquilly, cheerfully, he finished the voyage of life.\r\n\r\n  \"I trim myself to the storm of time,\r\n   I man the rudder, reef the sail,\r\n   Obey the voice at eve obeyed at prime:\r\n   'Lowly faithful, banish fear,\r\n   Right onward drive unharmed;\r\n   The port, well worth the cruise, is near.\r\n   And every wave is charmed.'\"\r\n\r\nEmerson died on the 27th of April 1882, and his body was laid to rest in\r\nthe peaceful cemetery of Sleepy Hollow, in a grove on the edge of the\r\nvillage of Concord.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--_Emerson's Complete Works_, Riverside edition, edited by\r\n  J.E.

Unsuccessful as a\r\nteacher he devoted himself entirely to studious retirement, and\r\npublished many works which are singularly free from errata. In mechanics\r\nhe never advanced a proposition which he had not previously tested in\r\npractice, nor published an invention without first proving its effects\r\nby a model. He was skilled in the science of music, the theory of\r\nsounds, and the ancient and modern scales; but he never attained any\r\nexcellence as a performer. He died on the 20th of May 1782 at his native\r\nvillage. Emerson was eccentric and indeed clownish, but he possessed\r\nremarkable independence of character and intellectual energy. The\r\nboldness with which he expressed his opinions on religious subjects led\r\nto his being charged with scepticism, but for this there was no\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\n  Emerson's works include _The Doctrine of Fluxions_ (1748); _The\r\n  Projection of the Sphere, Orthographic, Stereographic and Gnomical_\r\n  (1749); _The Elements of Trigonometry_ (1749); _The Principles of\r\n  Mechanics_ (1754); _A Treatise of Navigation_ (1755); _A Treatise of\r\n  Algebra_, in two books (1765); _The Arithmetic of Infinites, and the\r\n  Differential Method, illustrated by Examples_ (1767); _Mechanics, or\r\n  the Doctrine of Motion_ (1769); _The Elements of Optics_, in four\r\n  books (1768); _A System of Astronomy_ (1769); _The Laws of Centripetal\r\n  and Centrifugal Force_ (1769); _The Mathematical Principles of\r\n  Geography_ (1770); _Tracts_ (1770); _Cyclomathesis, or an Easy\r\n  Introduction to the several branches of the Mathematics_ (1770), in\r\n  ten vols.; _A Short Comment on Sir Isaac Newton's Principia_; to which\r\n  is added, _A Defence of Sir Isaac against the objections that have\r\n  been made to several parts of his works_ (1770); _A Miscellaneous\r\n  Treatise containing several Mathematical Subjects_ (1776).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERY (Ger. _Smirgel_), an impure variety of corundum, much used as an\r\nabrasive agent. It was known to the Greeks under the name of [Greek:\r\nsmyris] or [Greek: smiris], which is defined by Dioscorides as a stone\r\nused in gem-engraving. The Hebrew word _shamir_ (related to the Egyptian\r\n_asmir_), where translated in our versions of the Old Testament\r\n\"adamant\" and \"diamond,\" probably signified the emery-stone or corundum.\r\n\r\nEmery occurs as a granular or massive, dark-coloured, dense substance,\r\nhaving much the appearance of an iron-ore. Its specific gravity varies\r\nwith its composition from 3.7 to 4.3. Under the microscope, it is seen\r\nto be a mechanical aggregate of corundum, usually in grains or minute\r\ncrystals of a bluish colour, with magnetite, which also is granular and\r\ncrystalline. Other iron oxides, like haematite and limonite, may be\r\npresent as alteration-products of the magnetite. Some of the alumina and\r\niron oxide may occasionally be chemically combined, so as to form an\r\niron spinel, or hercynite. In addition to these minerals emery sometimes\r\ncontains quartz, mica, tourmaline, cassiterite, &c. Indeed emery may be\r\nregarded as a rock rather than a definite mineral species.\r\n\r\nThe hardness of emery is about 8, whereas that of pure corundum is 9.\r\nThe \"abrasive power,\" or \"effective hardness,\" of emery is by no means\r\nproportional to the amount of alumina which it contains, but seems\r\nrather to depend on its physical condition. Thus, taking the effective\r\nhardness of sapphire as 100, Dr J. Lawrence Smith found that the emery\r\nof Samos with 70.10% of alumina had a corresponding hardness of 56; that\r\nof Naxos, with 68.53 of Al2O3, a hardness of 46; and that of Gumach with\r\n77.82 of Al2O3, a hardness of 47.\r\n\r\nEmery has been worked from a very remote period in the Isle of Naxos,\r\none of the Cyclades, whence the stone was called _naxium_ by Pliny and\r\nother Roman writers. The mineral occurs as loose blocks and as\r\nlenticular masses or irregular beds in granular limestone, associated\r\nwith crystalline schists. The Naxos emery has been described by\r\nProfessor G. Tschermak. From a chemical analysis of a sample it has been\r\ncalculated that the emery contained 52.4% of corundum, 32.1 of\r\nmagnetite, 11.5 of tourmaline, 2 of muscovite and 2 of margarite.\r\n\r\nImportant deposits of corundum were discovered in Asia Minor by J.\r\nLawrence Smith, when investigating Turkish mineral resources about 1847.\r\nThe chief sources of emery there are Gumach Dagh, a mountain about 12 m.\r\nE. of Ephesus; Kula, near Ala-shehr; and the mines in the hills between\r\nThyra and Cosbonnar, south of Smyrna. The occurrence is similar to that\r\nin Naxos. The emery is found as detached blocks in a reddish soil, and\r\nas rounded masses embedded in a crystalline limestone associated with\r\nmica-schist, gneiss and granite. The proportion of corundum in this\r\nemery is said to vary from 37 to 57%. Emery is worked at several\r\nlocalities in the United States, especially near Chester, in Hampden\r\ncounty, Mass., where it is associated with peridotites. The corundum and\r\nmagnetite are regarded by Dr J.H. Pratt as basic segregations from an\r\nigneous magma. The deposits were discovered by H.S. Lucas in 1864.\r\n\r\nThe hardness and toughness of emery render it difficult to work, but it\r\nmay be extracted from the rock by blasting in holes bored with diamond\r\ndrills. In the East fire-setting is employed. The emery after being\r\nbroken up is carefully picked by hand, and then ground or stamped, and\r\nseparated into grades by wire sieves. The higher grades are prepared by\r\nwashing and eleutriation, the finest being known as \"flour of emery.\" A\r\nvery fine emery dust is collected in the stamping room, where it is\r\ndeposited after floating in the air. The fine powder is used by\r\nlapidaries and plate-glass manufacturers. Emery-wheels are made by\r\nconsolidating the powdered mineral with an agglutinating medium like\r\nshellac or silicate of soda or vulcanized india-rubber. Such wheels are\r\nnot only used by dentists and lapidaries but are employed on a large\r\nscale in mechanical workshops for grinding, shaping and polishing steel.\r\nEmery-sticks, emery-cloth and emery-paper are made by coating the\r\nseveral materials with powdered emery mixed with glue, or other adhesive\r\nmedia. (See CORUNDUM.)     (F. W. R.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMETICS (from Gr. [Greek: emetikos], causing vomit), the term given to\r\nsubstances which are administered for the purpose of producing vomiting.\r\nIt is customary to divide emetics into two classes, those which produce\r\ntheir effect by acting on the vomiting centre in the medulla, and those\r\nwhich act directly on the stomach itself. There is considerable\r\nconfusion in the nomenclature of these two divisions, but all are agreed\r\nin calling the former class central emetics, and the latter gastric. The\r\ngastric emetics in common use are alum, ammonium carbonate, zinc\r\nsulphate, sodium chloride (common salt), mustard and warm water. Copper\r\nsulphate has been purposely omitted from this list, since unless it\r\nproduces vomiting very shortly after administration, being itself a\r\nviolent gastro-intestinal irritant, some other emetic must promptly be\r\nadministered. The central emetics are apomorphine, tartar emetic,\r\nipecacuanha, senega and squill. Of these tartar emetic and ipecacuanha\r\ncome under both heads: when taken by the mouth they act as gastric\r\nemetics before absorption into the blood, and later produce a further\r\nand more vigorous effect by stimulation of the medullary centre. It must\r\nbe remembered, however, that, valuable though these drugs are, their\r\naction is accompanied by so much depression, they should never be\r\nadministered except under medical advice.\r\n\r\nEmetics have two main uses: that of emptying the stomach, especially in\r\ncases of poisoning, and that of expelling the contents of the air\r\npassages, more especially in children before they have learnt or have\r\nthe strength to expectorate. Where a physician is in attendance, the\r\nfirst of these uses is nearly always replaced by lavage of the stomach,\r\nwhereby any subsequent depression is avoided. Emetics still have their\r\nplace, however, in the treatment of bronchitis, laryngitis and\r\ndiphtheria in children, as they aid in the expulsion of the morbid\r\nproducts. Occasionally also they are administered when a foreign body\r\nhas got into the larynx. Their use is contra-indicated in the case of\r\nanyone suffering from aneurism, hernia or arterio-sclerosis, or where\r\nthere is any tendency to haemorrhage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMEU, evidently from the Port. _Ema_,[1] a name which has in turn been\r\napplied to each of the earlier-known forms of Ratite birds, but has\r\nfinally settled upon that which inhabits Australia, though, up to the\r\nclose of the 18th century, it was given by most authors to the bird now\r\ncommonly called cassowary--this last word being a corrupted form of the\r\nMalayan _Suwari_ (see Crawfurd, _Gramm. and Dict. Malay Language_, ii.\r\npp. 178 and 25), apparently first printed as _Casoaris_ by Bontius in\r\n1658 (_Hist. nat. et med. Ind. Orient._ p. 71).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Ceram Cassowary.[2]]\r\n\r\nThe cassowaries (_Casuariidae_) and emeus (_Dromaeidae_)--as the latter\r\nname is now used--have much structural resemblance, and form the order\r\n_Megistanes_,[3] which is peculiar to the Australian Region. Huxley\r\nshowed (_Proc. Zool. Soc._, 1867, pp. 422, 423,) that they agree in\r\ndiffering from the other _Ratitae_ in many important characters; one of\r\nthe most obvious of them is that each contour-feather appears to be\r\ndouble, its _hyporachis_, or aftershaft, being as long as the main\r\nshaft--a feature noticed in the case of either form so soon as examples\r\nwere brought to Europe. The external distinctions of the two families\r\nare, however, equally plain. The cassowaries, when adult, bear a horny\r\nhelmet on their head; they have some part of the neck bare, generally\r\nmore or less ornamented with caruncles, and the claw of the inner toe is\r\nremarkably elongated. The emeus have no helmet, their head is feathered,\r\ntheir neck has no caruncles, and their inner toes bear a claw of no\r\nsingular character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Emeu.]\r\n\r\nThe type of the _Casuariidae_ is the species named by Linnaeus _Struthio\r\ncasuarius_ and by John Latham _Casuarius emeu_. Vieillot subsequently\r\ncalled it _C. galeatus_, and his epithet has been very commonly adopted\r\nby writers, to the exclusion of the older specific appellation. It seems\r\nto be peculiar to the island of Ceram, and was made known to\r\nnaturalists, as we learn from Clusius, in 1597, by the first Dutch\r\nexpedition to the East Indies, when an example was brought from Banda,\r\nwhither it had doubtless been conveyed from its native island. It was\r\nsaid to have been called by the inhabitants \"Emeu,\" or \"Ema,\" but this\r\nname they must have had from the earlier Portuguese navigators.[4] Since\r\nthat time examples have been continually imported into Europe, so that\r\nit has become one of the best-known members of the subclass _Ratitae_.\r\nFor a long time its glossy, but coarse and hair-like, black plumage, its\r\nlofty helmet, the gaudily-coloured caruncles of its neck, and the four\r\nor five barbless quills which represent its wing-feathers, made it\r\nappear unique among birds. But in 1857 Dr George Bennett certified the\r\nexistence of a second and perfectly distinct species of cassowary, an\r\ninhabitant of New Britain, where it was known to the natives as the\r\n_Mooruk_, and in his honour it was named by John Gould _C. bennetti_.\r\nSeveral examples were soon after received in England, and these\r\nconfirmed the view of it already taken. A considerable number of other\r\nspecies of the genus have since been described from various localities\r\nin the same subregion. Conspicuous among them from its large size and\r\nlofty helmet is the _C. australis_, from the northern parts of\r\nAustralia. Its existence indeed had been ascertained, by T.S. Wall, in\r\n1854, but the specimen obtained by that unfortunate explorer was lost,\r\nand it was not until 1867 that an example was submitted to competent\r\nnaturalists.\r\n\r\nNot much seems to be known of the habits of any of the cassowaries in a\r\nstate of nature. Though the old species occurs rather plentifully over\r\nthe whole of the interior of Ceram, A.R. Wallace was unable to obtain or\r\neven to see an example. They all appear to bear captivity well, and the\r\nhens in confinement frequently lay their dark-green and rough-shelled\r\neggs, which, according to the custom of the _Ratitae_, are incubated by\r\nthe cocks. The nestling plumage is mottled (_Proc. Zool. Soc._, 1863,\r\npl. xlii.), and when about half-grown they are clothed in dishevelled\r\nfeathers of a deep tawny colour.\r\n\r\nOf the emeus (as the word is now restricted) the best known is the\r\n_Casuarius novae-hollandiae_ of John Latham, made by Vieillot the type\r\nof his genus _Dromaeus_,[5] whence the name of the family (_Dromaeidae_)\r\nis taken. This bird immediately after the colonization of New South\r\nWales (in 1788) was found to inhabit the south-eastern portion of\r\nAustralia, where, according to John Hunter (_Hist. Journ._, &c., pp.\r\n409, 413), the natives call it _Maracry_, _Marryang_ or _Maroang_; but\r\nit has now been so hunted down that not an example remains at large in\r\nthe districts that have been fully settled. It is said to have existed\r\nalso on the islands of Bass Straits and in Tasmania, but it has been\r\nexterminated in both, without, so far as is known, any ornithologist\r\nhaving had the opportunity of determining whether the race inhabiting\r\nthose localities was specifically identical with that of the mainland or\r\ndistinct. Next to the ostrich the largest of existing birds, the common\r\nemeu is an inhabitant of the more open country, feeding on fruits, roots\r\nand herbage, and generally keeping in small companies. The nest is a\r\nshallow pit scraped in the ground, and from nine to thirteen eggs, in\r\ncolour varying from a bluish-green to a dark bottle-green, are laid\r\ntherein. These are hatched by the cock-bird, the period of incubation\r\nlasting from 70 to 80 days. The young at birth are striped\r\nlongitudinally with dark markings on a light ground. A remarkable\r\nstructure in _Dromaeus_ is a singular opening in the front of the\r\nwindpipe, communicating with a tracheal pouch. This has attracted the\r\nattention of several anatomists, and has been well described by Dr Murie\r\n(_Proc. Zool. Soc._, 1867, pp. 405-415). Various conjectures have been\r\nmade as to its function, the most probable of which seems to be that it\r\nis an organ of sound in the breeding-season, at which time the hen-bird\r\nhas long been known to utter a remarkably loud booming note. Due\r\nconvenience being afforded to it, the emeu thrives well, and readily\r\npropagates its kind in Europe. Like other Ratite birds it will take to\r\nthe water, and examples have been seen voluntarily swimming a wide\r\nriver.     (A.

According to Gesner in 1555 (lib. iii. p. 709), it\r\n    was the Portuguese name of the crane (_Grus communis_), and had been\r\n    transferred with the qualifying addition of \"_di Gei_\" (i.e.\r\n    ground-crane) to the ostrich. This statement is confirmed by\r\n    Aldrovandus (lib. ix. cap. 2). Subsequently, but in what order can\r\n    scarcely now be determined, the name was naturally enough used for\r\n    the ostrich-like birds inhabiting the lands discovered by the\r\n    Portuguese, both in the Old and in the New World. The last of these\r\n    are now known as rheas, and the preceding as cassowaries.\r\n\r\n  [2] The figures are taken, by permission, from Messrs Mosenthal and\r\n    Harting's _Ostriches and Ostrich Farming_ (Trubner & Co., 1877).\r\n\r\n  [3] _Ann. and Mag.

It has an area\r\nof 7967 sq. m., and a population of 2,477,690 (1901), embracing eight\r\nprovinces, as follows:--(1) Bologna (pop. 529,612; 61 communes); (2)\r\nFerrara (270,558; 16 communes); (3) Forli (283,996; 41 communes); (4)\r\nModena (323,598; 45 communes); (5) Parma (303,694; 50 communes); (6)\r\nPiacenza (250,491; 47 communes); (7) Ravenna (234,656; 18 communes); (8)\r\nReggio nell' Emilia (281,085; 43 communes). In these provinces the chief\r\ntowns, with communal populations, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Bologna (147,898), Imola (33,144), Budrio (17,077), S. Giovanni in\r\nPersiceto (15,978), Castelfranco (13,484), Castel S. Pietro (13,426),\r\nMedicina (12,575), Molinella (12,081), Crevalcore (11,408).\r\n\r\n(2) Ferrara (86,675), Copparo (39,222), Argenta (20,474), Portomaggiore\r\n(20,141), Cento (19,078), Bondeno (15,682), Comacchio (10,745).\r\n\r\n(3) Forli (43,321), Rimini (43,595). Cesena (42,509).\r\n\r\n(4) Modena (63,012), Carpi (22,876), Mirandola (13,721), Finale nell'\r\nEmilia (12,896), Pavullo nel Frignano (12,034).\r\n\r\n(5) Parma (48,523), Borgo S. Donnino (12,019).\r\n\r\n(6) Piacenza (35,647)..\r\n\r\n(7) Ravenna (63,364), Faenza (39,757), Lugo (27,244), Bagnacavallo\r\n(15,176), Brisighella (13,815), Alfonsine (10,369).\r\n\r\n(8) Reggio nell' Emilia (58,993), Correggio (14,445), Guastalla\r\n(11,091).\r\n\r\nThe northern portion of Emilia is entirely formed by a great plain\r\nstretching from the Via Aemilia to the Po; its highest point is not more\r\nthan 200 ft. above sea-level, while along the E. coast are the lagoons\r\nat the mouth of the Po and those called the Valli di Comacchio to the S.\r\nof them, and to the S. again the plain round Ravenna (10 ft.), which\r\ncontinues as far as Rimini, where the mountains come down to the coast.\r\n\r\nImmediately to the S.E. of the Via Aemilia the mountains begin to rise,\r\nculminating in the central chain of the Ligurian and Tuscan Apennines.\r\nThe boundary of Emilia follows the highest summits of the chain in the\r\nprovinces of Parma, Reggio and Modena, passing over the Monte Bue (5915\r\nft.) and the Monte Cimone (7103 ft.), while in the provinces of Bologna\r\nand Forli it keeps somewhat lower along the N.E. slopes of the chain.\r\nWith the exception of the Po, the main rivers of Emilia descend from\r\nthis portion of the Apennines, the majority of them being tributaries of\r\nthe Po; the Trebbia (which rises in the province of Genoa), Taro,\r\nSecchia and Panaro are the most important. Even the Reno, Ronco and\r\nMontone, which now flow directly into the Adriatic, were, in Roman\r\ntimes, tributaries of the Po, and the Savio and Rubicone seem to be the\r\nonly streams of any importance from these slopes of the Tuscan Apennines\r\nwhich ran directly into the sea in Roman times (see APENNINES).\r\n\r\nRailway communication in the plain of Emilia is unattended by\r\nengineering difficulties (except for the bridging of rivers) and is\r\nmainly afforded by the line from Piacenza to Rimini. This, as far as\r\nBologna, forms part of the main route from Milan to Florence and Rome,\r\nwhile beyond Rimini it follows the S.E. coast of Italy past Ancona as\r\nfar as Brindisi and Lecce. The description follows this main line in a\r\nS.E. direction. Piacenza, being immediately S. of a bridge over the Po,\r\nis an important centre; a line runs to the W. to Voghera, through which\r\nit communicates with the lines of W. Lombardy and Piedmont, and\r\nimmediately N. of the Po a line goes off to Cremona. A new bridge over\r\nthe Po carries a direct line from Cremona to Borgo S. Donnino. From\r\nParma starts a main line, followed by expresses from Milan to Rome,\r\nwhich crosses the Apennines to Spezia (and Sarzana, for Pisa and Rome),\r\ntunnelling under the pass of La Cisa, while in a N. and N.E. direction\r\nlines run to Brescia and Suzzara. From Reggio branch lines run to\r\nGuastalla, Carpi and Sassuolo, there being also a line from Sassuolo to\r\nModena. At Modena the main line to Verona through Suzzara and Mantua\r\ndiverges to the N.; there is also a branch N.N.E. to Mirandola, and\r\nanother S. to Vignola. Bologna is, however, the most important railway\r\ncentre; besides the line S. to Pistoia and Florence over the Apennines\r\nand the line S.E. to Rimini, Ancona and Brindisi, there is the main line\r\nN.N.E. to Ferrara, Padua and Venice, and there are branches to Budrio\r\nand Portomaggiore to the N.E., and to S. Felice sul Panaro and Poggio\r\nRusco to the N., which connect the main lines of the district.\r\n\r\nAt Castel Bolognese, 5 m. N.W. of Faenza, a branch goes off to Lugo,\r\nwhence there are connexions with Budrio, Lavezzola (on the line between\r\nRavenna and Ferrara) and Ravenna, and at Faenza a line, not traversed by\r\nexpress trains, goes across the Apennines to Florence. Rimini is\r\nconnected by a direct line with Ravenna and Ferrara; and Ferrara,\r\nbesides the main line S.S.W. to Bologna and N. by E. to Padua, has a\r\nbranch to Poggio Rusco, which goes on to Suzzara, a station on the main\r\nline between Modena and Verona. There are also many steam tramways in\r\nthe flatter part of the province, the fertility and agricultural\r\nactivity of which are considerable. The main products of the plain are\r\ncereals, wine, and, in the marshy districts near the Po, rice; the\r\nsystem prevailing is that of the mezzadria--half the produce to the\r\nowner and half to the cultivator. The ancient Roman divisions of the\r\nfields are still preserved in some places. There are also considerable\r\npastures, and cheese is produced, especially Parmesan. Flax, hemp and\r\nsilkworms are also cultivated, and a considerable quantity of poultry\r\nkept. The hill districts produce cereals, vines, olives and fruit; while\r\non the mountains are considerable chestnut and other forests, and\r\nextensive summer pastures, the flocks going in part to the Maremma in\r\nsummer, and in part to the pastures of the plain of the Emilia.\r\n\r\nThe name Emilia comes from the Via Aemilia (q.v.), the Roman road from\r\nAriminum to Placentia, which traversed the entire district from S.E. to\r\nN.W., its line being closely followed by the modern railway. The name\r\nwas transferred to the district (which formed the eighth Augustan region\r\nof Italy) as early as the time of Martial, in popular usage (_Epigr._\r\nvi. 85. 5), and in the 2nd and 3rd centuries it is frequently named as a\r\ndistrict under imperial judges (_iuridici_), generally in combination\r\nwith Flaminia or Liguria and Tuscia. The district of Ravenna was, as a\r\nrule, from the 3rd to the 5th century, not treated as part of Aemilia,\r\nthe chief town of the latter being Placentia. In the 4th century Aemilia\r\nand Liguria were joined to form a consular province; after that Aemilia\r\nstood alone, Ravenna being sometimes temporarily added to it. The\r\nboundaries of the ancient district correspond approximately with those\r\nof the modern.\r\n\r\nIn the Byzantine period Ravenna became the seat of an exarch; and after\r\nthe Lombards had for two centuries attempted to subdue the Pentapolis\r\n(Ravenna, Bologna, Forli, Faenza, Rimini), Pippin took these cities from\r\nAistulf and gave them, with the March of Ancona, to the papacy in 755,\r\nto which, under the name of Romagna, they continued to belong. At first,\r\nhowever, the archbishop of Ravenna was in reality supreme. The other\r\nchief cities of Emilia--Ferrara, Modena, Reggio, Parma, Piacenza--were,\r\non the other hand, independent, and in the period of the communal\r\nindependence of the individual towns of Italy each of the chief cities\r\nof Emilia, whether belonging to Romagna or not, had a history of its\r\nown; and, notwithstanding the feuds of Guelphs and Ghibellines,\r\nprospered considerably. The study of Roman law, especially at Bologna,\r\nacquired great importance. The imperial influence kept the papal power\r\nin check. Nicholas III. obtained control of the Romagna in 1278, but the\r\npapal dominion almost fell during the Avignon period, and was only\r\nmaintained by the efforts of Cardinal Albornoz, a Spaniard sent to Italy\r\nby Innocent VI. in 1353. Even so, however, the papal supremacy was\r\nlittle more than a name; and this state of things only ceased when\r\nCaesar Borgia, the natural son of Alexander VI., crushed most of the\r\npetty princes of Romagna, intending to found there a dynasty of his own;\r\nbut on the death of Alexander VI. it was his successors in the papacy\r\nwho carried on and profited by what Caesar Borgia had begun. The towns\r\nwere thenceforth subject to the church and administered by cardinal\r\nlegates. Ferrara and Comacchio remained under the house of Este until\r\nthe death of Alphonso II. in 1597, when they were claimed by Pope\r\nClement VIII. as vacant fiefs. Modena and Reggio, which had formed part\r\nof the Ferrara duchy, were thenceforth a separate duchy under a branch\r\nof the house of Este, which was descended from a natural son of Alphonso\r\nI. Carpi and Mirandola were small principalities, the former of which\r\npassed to the house of Este in 1525, in which year Charles V. expelled\r\nthe Pio family, while the last of the Pico dynasty of Mirandola,\r\nFrancesco Maria, having sided with the French in the war of Spanish\r\nSuccession, was deprived of his duchy in 1709 by the emperor Joseph I.,\r\nwho sold it to the house of Este in 1710. Parma and Piacenza were at\r\nfirst under the Farnese, Pope Paul III. having placed his natural son\r\nPier Luigi therein 1545, and then, after the extinction of the family\r\nin 1731, under a secondary branch of the Bourbons of Spain. In\r\n1796-1814, Emilia was first incorporated in the Italian republic and\r\nthen in the Napoleonic Italian kingdom; after 1815 there was a return to\r\nthe _status quo ante_, Romagna returning to the papacy and its\r\necclesiastical government, the duchy of Parma being given to Marie\r\nLouise, wife of the deposed Napoleon, and Modena to the archduke Francis\r\nof Austria, the heir of the last Este. In Romagna and Modena the\r\ngovernment was oppressive, arbitrary, corrupt and unprogressive, while\r\nin Parma things were better. In 1821 and 1831 there were unsuccessful\r\nattempts at revolt in Emilia, which were sternly and cruelly repressed;\r\nchronic discontent continued and the people joined again in the movement\r\nof 1848-1849, which was crushed by Austrian troops. In 1859 the struggle\r\nfor independence was finally successful, Emilia passing to the Italian\r\nkingdom almost without resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMINENCE (Lat. _eminentia_), a title of honour now confined to the\r\ncardinals of the Church of Rome. It was originally given as a\r\ncomplimentary title to emperors, kings, and then to less conspicuous\r\npersons. The Roman empire of the 4th century adopted from the \"vanity of\r\nthe East the forms and ceremonies of ostentatious greatness.\" Gibbon\r\nincludes in the \"profusion of epithets\" by which \"the purity of the\r\nLatin language was debased,\" and which were lavished on \"the principal\r\nofficers of the empire,\" \"your Sincerity, your Gravity, your Excellency,\r\nyour Eminence, your sublime and wonderful Magnitude, your illustrious\r\nand magnificent Highness.\" From the _notitia dignitatum_ it passed into\r\nthe Latin of the middle ages as a flattering epithet, and was applied in\r\nthe church and by the popes to the dignified clergy at large, and\r\nsometimes as a pure form of civility to churchmen of modest rank. On the\r\n10th of June 1630, Urban VIII. confined the use of the titles\r\n_Eminentiae_ and _Eminentissimi_ to the cardinals, to imperial electors,\r\nand to the master of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem (order of the\r\nKnights of Malta). Since the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and\r\nthe entire change, if not actual destruction, of the order of St John,\r\nthe title \"eminence\" has become strictly confined to the cardinals.\r\nBefore 1630 the members of the Sacred College were \"Illustrissimi\" and\r\n\"Reverendissimi.\" It is, therefore, not correct to speak of a cardinal\r\nwho lived before that time as \"his Eminence.\"\r\n\r\n  See du Cange, _Glossarium mediae et infimae latinitatis_ (Niort and\r\n  London, 1884), s.v. \"Eminentia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMINENT DOMAIN (Lat. _eminens_, rising high above surrounding objects:\r\nand _dominium_, domain), a term applied in law to the sovereign right of\r\na state to appropriate private property to public uses, whether the\r\nowner consents or not. It is repeatedly employed by Grotius (e.g. _De\r\njure belli_, bk. iii. c. 20, s. 7), Bynkershoek (_Quaest. jur. pub._ bk.\r\n2, c. 15), and Puffendorf (_De jure naturae et gentium_, bk. i. c. 1, s.\r\n19),--the two latter, however, preferring the word _imperium_ to\r\n_dominium_; and by other Dutch jurists. But in modern times it is\r\nchiefly in the United States of America that the doctrine of eminent\r\ndomain has received its application, and it is chiefly to American law\r\nthat the following remarks refer (see also the article COMPENSATION).\r\nEminent domain is distinguishable alike from the _police power_, by\r\nwhich restrictions are imposed on private property in the public\r\ninterest, e.g. in connexion with the liquor traffic or public health\r\n(see _re Haff_ (1904), 197 U.S. 488); from the _power of taxation_, by\r\nwhich the owner of private property is compelled to contribute a portion\r\nof it for public purposes; and from the _war-power_, involving the\r\ndestruction of private property in the course of military operations.\r\nThe police power fetters rights of property; eminent domain takes them\r\naway. The power of taxation is analogous to eminent domain as regards\r\nthe purposes to which the contribution of the tax-payer is to be\r\napplied. But, unlike eminent domain, it does not necessarily involve a\r\ntaking of specific property for those purposes. The destruction of\r\nproperty in military operations--or in the discharge by Government of\r\nother duties in cases of necessity, e.g. in order to check the progress\r\nof a fire in a city--clearly cannot be said to be an exercise of the\r\npower of eminent domain. The question whether the element of\r\ncompensation is necessarily involved in the idea of eminent domain has\r\nin modern times aroused much controversy. According to one school of\r\nthought (see Lewis, _Eminent Domain_, s. 10), this question must be\r\nanswered in the negative. According to a second, whose view has the\r\nsupport of the civilians (see Randolph, _Eminent Domain_, s. 227; Mills,\r\n_Eminent Domain_, s. 1) compensation is an inherent attribute of the\r\npower. An intermediate view is advocated by Professor Thayer (_Cases on\r\nConstitutional Law_, vol. 1, 953), according to which eminent domain\r\nsprings from the necessities of government, while the obligation to\r\nreimburse rests upon the natural right of individuals. The right to\r\ncompensation is thus not a component part of the power to take, but\r\narises at the same time and the latter cannot exist without it. The\r\nrelation between the two is that of substance and shadow. The matter is\r\nnot, however, of great practical importance, for the Federal\r\nConstitution prohibits the exercise of the power \"without just\r\ncompensation\" (5th Amendment), while in most of the states the State\r\nconstitution or other legislation has imposed upon it a similar\r\nlimitation: and the tendency of modern judicial decisions is in favour\r\nof the view that the absence of such a limitation will make an enactment\r\nso far unconstitutional and invalid.\r\n\r\nIn order to justify the exercise of the power of eminent domain, the\r\npurposes to which the property taken is to be applied must be \"public,\"\r\ni.e. primarily public, and not primarily of private interest and merely\r\nincidentally beneficial to the public (_Madisonville Traction Co. v.\r\nMining Co._, 1904, 196 U.S. 239). Subject to this definition, the term\r\n\"public\" receives a wide interpretation. All kinds of property may be\r\ntaken; and the procedure indicated by the different legislatures must be\r\nfollowed. Any contravention of this rule would involve a breach of the\r\n5th Amendment of the Federal Constitution, which provides that \"no\r\nperson ... shall be ... deprived of ... property, without due process of\r\nlaw.\" It may be added that if the performance of a covenant is rendered\r\nimpossible by an act of eminent domain the covenantor is excused.\r\n\r\nIn _English law_, the only exact analogue to the doctrine of eminent\r\ndomain is to be found in the prerogative right of the crown to enter\r\nupon the lands of subjects or to interfere with their enjoyment for the\r\ndefence of the realm (see _A.G. v. Tomline_; 1879; 12 Ch. D. 214). No\r\nattempt is made to exercise this prerogative, and lands are acquired for\r\nstate purposes by statute usually framed on or incorporating the Lands\r\nClauses Acts (see COMPENSATION). The French _Code Civil_ secures\r\ncompensation to the owner of property in cases of _expropriation pour\r\ncause d'utilite publique_ (art. 545), and there is similar provision in\r\nBelgium (Const. Law, art. II.), Holland (Fundamental Law, art. 147),\r\nSpain (Civil Code, art. 349, and Law of 3rd May, 1841), and most other\r\nEuropean states. It has been held in France that the right to\r\ncompensation does not arise under art. 545 of the Code Civil where only\r\na _servitude d'utilite publique_ is created on a private individual's\r\nland.\r\n\r\n  In addition to the authorities cited in the text, see Lewis, _Eminent\r\n  Domain_ (2nd ed., Chicago, 1900); Mills, _Eminent Domain_ (2nd ed., St\r\n  Louis, 1888); Randolph, _Eminent Domain in the United States_ (Boston,\r\n  1894).     (A. W. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMINESCU, MICHAIL (1849-1889), the greatest Rumanian poet of the 19th\r\ncentury, was born on the 20th of December in Ipateshti near Botoshani,\r\nin the north of Moldavia. He was of Turco-Tatar origin, and his surname\r\nwas originally Emin; this was changed to Eminovich and finally to the\r\nRumanian form Eminescu. He was educated for a time in Czernowitz, and\r\nthen entered the civil service. In 1864 he resumed his studies in\r\nTransylvania, but soon joined a roving theatrical company where he\r\nplayed in turn the roles of actor, prompter and stage-manager. After a\r\nfew years he went to Vienna, Jena and Berlin, where he attended\r\nlectures, especially on philosophy. In 1874 he was appointed school\r\ninspector and librarian at the university of Jassy, but was soon turned\r\nout through the change of government, and took charge, as editor in\r\nchief, of the Conservative paper _Timpul_ (Times). In 1883 he had the\r\nfirst attack of the insanity hereditary in his family, and in 1889 he\r\ndied in a private institution in Bucharest. In 1870 his great poetical\r\ntalent was revealed by two contributions to the _Convorbiri literare_,\r\nthe organ of the Junimist party in Jassy; these were the poems \"Venera\r\nsi Madona\" and \"Epigonii.\" Other poems followed and soon established his\r\nclaim to be the first among the modern poets of his country. He was\r\nthoroughly acquainted with the chronicles of the past, had a complete\r\nmastery of the Rumanian language, and was a lover and admirer of\r\nRumanian popular poetry. Influenced by these studies and by the\r\nphilosophy of Schopenhauer, he introduced a new spirit into Rumanian\r\npoetry. Mystically inclined and himself of a melancholy disposition, he\r\nlived in the glory of the medieval Rumanian past; stifled by the\r\nartificiality of the world around him, he rebelled against the\r\nconventionality of society and his surroundings. In inimitable language\r\nhe denounced the vileness of the present and painted in glowing pictures\r\nthe heroism of the past; he also surprised nature in its primitive\r\nbeauty, and he gave expression to stirring emotions in lyrics couched in\r\nthe language and metre of popular poetry. He further proved himself an\r\nunsurpassed master in satire. Over all his poetry hangs a cloud of\r\nsadness, the sense of coming doom. Simplicity of language, masterly\r\nhandling of rhyme and verse, deep thought and plastic expression made\r\nEminescu the creator of a school of poetry which dominated the thought\r\nof Rumania and the expression of Rumanian writers and poets at the end\r\nof the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th.\r\n\r\n  Five editions of his collected poems appeared after 1890. Some of them\r\n  were translated into German by \"Carmen Sylva\" and Mite Kremnitz, and\r\n  others have also been translated into several other languages.\r\n  Eminescu also wrote two short novels, real poems in prose (Jassy,\r\n  1890).     (M. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMIN PASHA [EDUARD SCHNITZER] (1840-1892), German traveller,\r\nadministrator and naturalist, was the son of Ludwig Schnitzer, a\r\nmerchant of Oppeln in Silesia, and was born in Oppeln on the 28th of\r\nMarch 1840. He was educated at the universities of Breslau, Berlin and\r\nKonigsberg, and took the degree of M.D. at Berlin. He displayed an early\r\npredilection for zoology and ornithology, and in later life became a\r\nskilled and enthusiastic collector, particularly of African plants and\r\nbirds. When he was four-and-twenty he determined to seek his fortunes\r\nabroad, and made his way to Turkey, where, after practising medicine on\r\nhis own account for a short time, he was appointed (in 1865) quarantine\r\nmedical officer at Antivari. The duties of the post were not heavy, and\r\nallowed him leisure for a diligent study of Turkish, Arabic and Persian.\r\nFrom 1870 to 1874 he was in the service of the governor of northern\r\nAlbania, had adopted a Turkish name (though not that by which he\r\nafterwards became so widely known), and was practically naturalized as a\r\nTurk.\r\n\r\nAfter a visit home in 1875 he went to Cairo, and then to Khartum, in the\r\nhope of an opportunity for travelling in the interior of Africa. This\r\ncame to him in the following year, when General Charles George Gordon,\r\nwho had recently succeeded Sir Samuel Baker as governor of the\r\nequatorial provinces of Egypt, invited Schnitzer, who was now known as\r\n\"Emin Effendi,\" to join him at Lado on the upper Nile. Although\r\nnominally Gordon's medical officer, Emin was soon entrusted with\r\npolitical missions of some importance to Uganda and Unyoro. In these he\r\nacquitted himself so well that when, in 1878, Gordon's successor at Lado\r\nwas deprived of his office on account of malpractices (Gordon himself\r\nhaving been made governor-general of the Sudan), Emin was chosen to fill\r\nthe post of governor of the Equatorial Province (i.e. the old equatorial\r\nprovinces minus the Bahr-el-Ghazal) and given the title of \"bey.\" He\r\nproved an energetic and enterprising governor; indeed, his enterprise on\r\nmore than one occasion brought him into conflict with Gordon, who\r\neventually decided to remove Emin to Suakin. Before the change could be\r\neffected, however, Gordon resigned his post in the Sudan, and his\r\nsuccessor revoked the order.\r\n\r\nThe next three or four years were employed by Emin in various journeys\r\nthrough his province, and in the initiation of schemes for its\r\ndevelopment, until in 1882, on his return from a visit to Khartum, he\r\nbecame aware that the Mahdist rising, which had originated in Kordofan,\r\nwas spreading southward. The effect of the rising was, of course, more\r\nmarkedly felt in Emin's province after the abandonment of the Sudan by\r\nthe Egyptian government in 1884. He was obliged to give up several of\r\nhis stations in face of the Mahdist advance, and ultimately to retire\r\nfrom Lado, which had been his capital, to Wadelai. This last step\r\nfollowed upon his receipt of a letter from Nubar Pasha, informing him\r\nthat it was impossible for the Egyptian government to send him help, and\r\nthat he must stay in his province or retire towards the coast as best he\r\ncould. Emin (who about this time was raised to the rank of pasha) had\r\nsome thoughts of a retreat to Zanzibar, but decided to remain where he\r\nwas and endeavour to hold his own. To this end he carried on protracted\r\nnegotiations with neighbouring native potentates. When, in 1887, (Sir)\r\nH.M. Stanley's expedition was on its way to relieve him, it is clear\r\nfrom Emin's diary that he had no wish to leave his province, even if\r\nrelieved. He had done good work there, and established a position which\r\nhe believed himself able to maintain. He hoped, however, that the\r\npresence of Stanley's force, when it came, would strengthen his\r\nposition; but the condition of the relieving party, when it arrived in\r\nApril 1888, did not seem to Emin to promise this. Stanley's proposal to\r\nEmin, as stated in the latter's diary, was that Emin should either\r\nremain as governor-general on behalf of the king of the Belgians, or\r\nestablish himself on Victoria Nyanza on behalf of a group of English\r\nmerchants who wished to start an enterprise in Africa on the model of\r\nthe East India Company. After much hesitation, and prompted by a growing\r\ndisaffection amongst the natives (owing, as he maintained, to his loss\r\nof prestige after the arrival of Stanley's force), Emin decided to\r\naccompany Stanley to the coast, where the expedition arrived in December\r\n1889. Unfortunately, on the evening of a reception dinner given in his\r\nhonour, Emin met with an accident which resulted in fracture of the\r\nskull. Careful nursing gradually restored him to health, and on his\r\nconvalescence he resolutely maintained his decision to remain in Africa,\r\nand, if possible, to work there in future on behalf of the German\r\ngovernment. The seal was definitely set upon this decision by his formal\r\nengagement on behalf of his native country, early in 1890. Preparations\r\nfor a new expedition into the interior were set on foot, and meanwhile\r\nEmin was honoured in various ways by learned societies in Germany and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe object of the new expedition was (to quote Emin's instructions) \"to\r\nsecure on behalf of Germany the territories situated south of and along\r\nVictoria Nyanza up to Albert Nyanza,\" and to \"make known to the\r\npopulation there that they were placed under German supremacy and\r\nprotection, and to break or undermine Arab influence as far as\r\npossible.\" The force, which was well equipped, started at the end of\r\nApril 1890. But before it had penetrated far inland the political\r\nreasons for sending the expedition vanished with the signature, on the\r\n1st of July 1890, of the Anglo-German agreement defining the spheres of\r\ninfluence of the two nations, an agreement which excluded the Albert\r\nNyanza region from the German sphere. For a time things went well enough\r\nwith the expedition; Emin occupied the important town of Tabora on the\r\nroute from the coast to Tanganyika and established the post of Bukoba on\r\nVictoria Nyanza, but by degrees ill-fortune clouded its prospects.\r\nDifficulties on the route; dissensions between Emin and the authorities\r\nin German East Africa, and misunderstandings on the part of both;\r\nepidemics of disease in Emin's force, followed by a growing spirit of\r\nmutiny among his native followers; an illness of a painful nature which\r\nattacked him--all these gradually undermined Emin's courage, and his\r\ndiaries at the close of 1891 reflect a gloomy and almost hopeless\r\nspirit. In May that year he had crossed into the Congo State by the\r\nsouth shore of Albert Edward Nyanza, and many months were spent on the\r\nborders of the great Congo Forest and in the Undusuma country south-west\r\nof Albert Nyanza, breaking ground new to Europeans. In December 1891 he\r\nsent off his companion, Dr Stuhlmann, with the bulk of the caravan, on\r\nthe way back to the east coast. Emin remained behind with the sick, and\r\nwith a very reduced following left the lake district in March 1892 for\r\nthe Congo river. On reaching Ipoto on the Ituri he came within the\r\nregion of the Arab slave raiders and ivory hunters, in whose company he\r\nat times travelled. These gentry were incensed against Emin for the\r\nenergetic way in which he had dealt with their comrades while in German\r\nterritory, and against Europeans generally by the campaign for their\r\nsuppression begun by the Congo State. At the instigation of one of these\r\nArabs Emin was murdered on the 23rd or 24th of October 1892 at Kinena, a\r\nplace about 80 m. E.S.E. of Stanley Falls.\r\n\r\n  See _Emin Pasha, his Life and Work_, by Georg Schweitzer, with\r\n  introduction by R.W. Felkin (2 vols., London, 1898); _Emin Pasha in\r\n  Central Africa_ (London, 1888), a collection of Emin's papers\r\n  contributed to scientific journals; and _Mit Emin Pascha ins Herz von\r\n  Afrika_ (Berlin, 1894), by Dr Franz Stuhlmann. Major G. Casati\r\n  (1838-1902), an Italian officer who spent several years with Emin, and\r\n  accompanied him and Stanley to the coast, narrated his experiences in\r\n  _Dieci anni in Equatoria_ (English edition, _Ten Years in Equatoria\r\n  and the Return with Emin Pasha_, London, 1891).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMLYN, THOMAS (1663-1741), English nonconformist divine, was born at\r\nStamford, Lincolnshire. He served as chaplain to the presbyterian\r\nLetitia, countess of Donegal, and then to Sir Robert Rich, afterwards\r\n(1691) becoming colleague to Joseph Boyse, presbyterian minister in\r\nDublin. From this office he was virtually dismissed on his own\r\nconfession of unitarianism, and for publishing _An Humble Inquiry into\r\nthe Scripture Account of Jesus Christ_ (1702) was sentenced to a year's\r\nimprisonment and a fine of L1000. Thanks to the intervention of Boyse he\r\nwas released in 1705 on payment of L90. He is said to have been the\r\nfirst English preacher definitely to describe himself as \"unitarian,\"\r\nand writes in his diary, \"I thank God that He did not call me to this\r\nlot of suffering till I had arrived at maturity of judgment and firmness\r\nof resolution, and that He did not desert me when my friends did. He\r\nnever let me be so cast down as to renounce the truth or to waver in my\r\nfaith.\" Of Christ he writes, \"We may regard with fervent gratitude so\r\ngreat a benefactor, but our esteem and rational love must ascend higher\r\nand not rest till it centre in his God and ours.\" Emlyn preached a good\r\ndeal in Paul's Alley, Barbican, in his later years, and died in London\r\nin 1741.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMMANUEL, or IMMANUEL, a Hebrew symbolical proper name, meaning \"God\r\n(is) with us.\" When in 734-733 B.C. Ahaz, king of Judah, alarmed at the\r\npreparations made against him by the Syro-Ephraimitish alliance, was\r\ninclined to seek aid from Tiglath-pileser of Assyria, the prophet Isaiah\r\nendeavoured to allay his fear by telling him that the danger would pass\r\naway, and as a sign from Yahweh that this should be so, any young woman\r\nwho should within the year bear a son, might call his name Immanuel in\r\ntoken of the divine protection accorded to Judah. For before the infant\r\nshould come to even the immature intelligence of childhood the lands of\r\nthe foe would be laid waste (Isaiah vii. 14-16). For other\r\ninterpretations, especially as regards the mother, see _Ency. Bib._ col.\r\n2162-3, and the commentaries. In the post-exilic period the historical\r\nmeaning of the passage was forgotten, and a new significance was given\r\nto it in accordance with the gradually developing eschatological\r\ndoctrine. This new interpretation finds expression in Matt. i. 23, where\r\nthe name is applied to Jesus as the Messiah. At the close of Isaiah\r\nviii. 8 for \"of thy land, O Immanuel,\" we should probably read \"of the\r\nland, for God is with us.\" The three passages quoted are the only\r\ninstances where this word occurs in Scripture; it is frequent in hymns\r\nand devotional literature as a title of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMMANUEL PHILIBERT (1528-1580), duke of Savoy, son of Charles III. and\r\nBeatrice of Portugal, one of the most renowned princes of the later\r\nRenaissance, was born on the 8th of July 1528. Charles, after trying in\r\nvain to remain neutral in the wars between France and the emperor\r\nCharles V., had been forced to side with the latter, whereupon his duchy\r\nwas overrun with foreign soldiery and became the battlefield of the\r\nrival armies. Prince Emmanuel took service with the emperor in 1545 and\r\ndistinguished himself in Germany, France and the Low Countries. On the\r\ndeath of his father in 1553 he succeeded to the title, little more than\r\nan empty one, and continued in the emperor's service. Having been\r\nrefused the command of the imperial troops in Piedmont, he tried in vain\r\nto negotiate a separate peace with France; but in 1556 France and Spain\r\nconcluded a five years' truce, by which each was to retain what it then\r\noccupied. This would have been the end of Savoy, but within a year the\r\ntwo powers were again at war. The chief events of the campaign were the\r\nsuccessful resistance of Cuneo, held for the duke by Count Luserna, and\r\nthe victory of St Quentin (1557), won by Emmanuel Philibert himself\r\nagainst the French. At last in 1558 the powers agreed to an armistice,\r\nand in 1559 the peace of Cateau-Cambresis was made, by which Emmanuel\r\nregained his duchy, but on onerous terms, for France was to occupy\r\nseveral Piedmontese fortresses, including Turin and Pinerolo, for not\r\nmore than three years, and a marriage was arranged between the duke and\r\nMargaret, duchess of Berry, sister of the French king; while Spain was\r\nto garrison Asti and Vercelli (afterwards exchanged for Santhia) until\r\nFrance evacuated the above-mentioned fortresses. The duke's marriage\r\ntook place in Paris a few months later; and after the French evacuation\r\nhe re-entered his dominions amidst the rejoicings of the people. The\r\ncondition of Piedmont at that time was deplorable; for wars, the\r\nexactions and devastations of the foreign soldiery, and religious\r\nantagonism between Catholics and Protestants had wrought terrible havoc.\r\n\"Uncultivated,\" wrote the Venetian ambassador, quoted by E. Ricotti, \"no\r\ncitizens in the cities, neither man nor beast in the fields, all the\r\nland forest-clad and wild; one sees no houses, for most of them are\r\nburnt, and of nearly all the castles only the walls are visible; of the\r\ninhabitants, once so numerous, some have died of the plague or of\r\nhunger, some by the sword, and some have fled elsewhere preferring to\r\nbeg their bread abroad rather than support misery at home which is worse\r\nthan death.\" There was no army, the administration was chaotic, and the\r\nfinances were in a hopeless state. The duke set to work to put his house\r\nin order, and inaugurated a series of useful reforms, ably assisted by\r\nhis minister, Niccolo Balbo. But progress was slow, and was accompanied\r\nby measures which abolished the states general, the last survival of\r\nfeudal liberties. Savoy, following the tendency of the other states of\r\nEurope at that time, became thenceforth an absolute monarchy, but\r\nwithout that transformation the achievement of complete independence\r\nfrom foreign powers would have been impossible.\r\n\r\nOne of the first questions with which he had to deal was the religious\r\ndifficulty. The inhabitants of the Pellice and Chisone valleys had long\r\nprofessed a primitive form of Christianity which the orthodox regarded\r\nas heretical, and had been subject to numerous persecutions in\r\nconsequence (see WALDENSES). At the time of the Reformation they had\r\ngone over to Protestantism, and during the wars of the 16th century the\r\nnew religion made great progress in Piedmont. The duke as a devout\r\nCatholic desired to purge the state of heresy, and initiated repressive\r\nmeasures against the Waldenses, but after some severe and not very\r\nsuccessful fighting he ended by allowing them a measure of religious\r\nliberty in those valleys (1561). At the pope's instigation he\r\nrecommenced persecution some years later, but his duchess and some\r\nGerman princes pleaded successfully in favour of the Protestants. He\r\nnext turned his attention to getting rid of the French garrisons; the\r\nnegotiations proved long and troublesome, but in December 1562 the\r\nFrench departed on payment of 100,000 scudi, retaining only Pinerolo and\r\nSavigliano, and Turin became the capital once more. There remained the\r\nBernese, who had occupied some of the duke's territories in Savoy and\r\nVaud, and in Geneva, over which he claimed certain rights. With Bern he\r\nmade a compromise, regaining Gex, the Chablais, and the Genevois, on\r\ncondition that Protestantism should be tolerated there, but he renounced\r\nVaud and some other districts (1566). Disagreements with the Valais were\r\nsettled in a similar way in 1569; but the Genevans refused to recognize\r\nSavoyard suzerainty. Emmanuel reformed the currency, reorganized\r\njustice, prepared the way for the emancipation of the serfs, raised the\r\nstanding army to 25,000 men, and fortified the frontiers, ostensibly\r\nagainst Huguenot raids, but in reality from fear of France. On the death\r\nof Charles IX. of France in 1574 the new king, Henry III., passed\r\nthrough Piedmont on his way from Poland; Emmanuel gave him a magnificent\r\nreception, and obtained from him a promise that Pinerolo and Savigliano\r\nshould be evacuated, which was carried out at the end of the year.\r\nPhilip of Spain was likewise induced to evacuate Asti and Santhia in\r\n1575. Thus, after being more or less under foreign occupation for 39\r\nyears, the duchy was at last free. The duke rounded off his dominions by\r\nthe purchase of Tenda and Oneglia, which increased his seaboard, and the\r\nlast years of his life were spent in fruitless negotiations to obtain\r\nMonferrato, held by the Gonzagas under Spanish protection, and Saluzzo,\r\nwhich was a French fief. He died on the 30th of August 1580, and was\r\nsucceeded by his son Charles Emmanuel I. As a statesman Emmanuel\r\nPhilibert was able, business-like and energetic; but he has been\r\ncriticized for his duplicity, although in this respect he was no worse\r\nthan most other European princes, whose ends were far more questionable.\r\nHe was autocratic, but just and very patriotic. During his reign the\r\nduchy, which had been more than half French, became predominantly\r\nItalian. By diplomacy, which, although he was a capable and brave\r\nsoldier, he preferred to war, he succeeded in freeing his country, and\r\nconverting it from a ruined and divided land into a respectable\r\nindependent power of the second rank, and, after Venice, the\r\nbest-governed state in Italy.\r\n\r\n  The most accurate biography of Emmanuel Philibert is contained in E.\r\n  Ricotti's _Storia della monarchia Piemontese_, vol. ii. (Florence,\r\n  1861), which is well done and based on documents; cf. Claretta's _La\r\n  Successione di Emanuele Filiberto_ (Turin, 1884).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMMAUS, the name of two places in Palestine.\r\n\r\n1. A village mentioned by Luke (xxiv. 13), without any indication of\r\ndirection, as being 60 stadia (almost 7 m.), or according to some\r\nMSS.[1] 160 stadia, from Jerusalem. Its identification is a matter of\r\nmere guesswork: it has been sought at (a) Emmaus-Nicopolis (see 2\r\nbelow), distant 176 stadia from Jerusalem; (b) Kuryet el-'Enab, distant\r\n66 stadia, on the carriage road to Jaffa; (c) Kulonieh, distant 36\r\nstadia, on the same road; (d) el-Kubeibeh, distant 63 stadia, on the\r\nRoman road to Lydda; (e) 'Urtas, distant 60 stadia; and (f) Khurbet\r\nel-Khamasa, distant 86 stadia, on the Roman road to Eleutheropolis. Of\r\nthese, el-Kubeibeh or 'Urtas seems the most probable, though many favour\r\nKulonieh because of its nearness to Bet Mizza, in which name there is\r\nsimilarity with Emmaus, and because of a reading (30 stadia) in\r\nJosephus.\r\n\r\n2. Emmaus-Nicopolis, now 'Amwas, a town on the maritime plain, and a\r\nplace of importance during the Maccabaean and Jewish wars. Near it Judas\r\nMaccabaeus defeated Gorgias in 164 B.C., and Vespasian established a\r\nfortified camp in A.D. 69. It was afterwards rebuilt and named\r\nNicopolis, and became an episcopal see. It was also noted for a healing\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Including Codex [Hebrew: alef]. But this distance is too great\r\n    for the conditions of Luke's narrative and the reading (160) is\r\n    evidently an attempt to harmonize with the traditional identification\r\n    of Emmaus-Nicopolis held by Eusebius and Jerome. For a curious\r\n    reading in three old Latin MSS, which makes Emmaus the name of the\r\n    second traveller on the journey, see _Expos. Times_, xiii. 429, 477,\r\n    561.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMMENDINGEN, a town of Germany, in the grand-duchy of Baden, close to\r\nthe Black Forest, on the Elz and the main line of railway\r\nMannheim-Constance. Pop. 6200. It has a Protestant church with a fine\r\nspire, a Roman Catholic church, a handsome town-hall, an old castle (now\r\na hospital), once the residence of the counts of Hochberg, spinning\r\nmills, tanneries and manufactures of photographic instruments, paper,\r\nmachinery and cigars. There is also a considerable trade in timber and\r\ncattle. Here the author Johann Georg Schlosser (1739-1799), the husband\r\nof Goethe's sister Cornelia (who died in 1777 and is interred in the old\r\ngraveyard), was _Oberamtmann_ (bailiff) for a few years.\r\n\r\nEmmendingen was formerly the seat of the counts of Hochberg, a cadet\r\nbranch of the margraves of Baden. In 1418 it received market rights from\r\nthe emperor, and in 1590 was raised to the status of a town, and walled,\r\nby Margrave Jacob III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMMERICH (the ancient _Embrica_), a town of Germany, in the Prussian\r\nRhine province, on the right bank of the Rhine and the railway from\r\nCologne to Amsterdam, 5 m. N.E. of Cleves. Pop. (1905) 12,578. It has a\r\nconsiderable shipping trade, and manufactories of tobacco and cigars,\r\nchocolate, margarine, oil, chemicals, brushes, vinegar, soap, guano and\r\nperfumery. There are also iron foundries and machine factories. The old\r\nminster church, built in the middle of the 11th century, contains some\r\nfine choir stalls.\r\n\r\nEmmerich, formerly called Embrika and Emrik, originally a Roman colony,\r\nis mentioned in records so early as the 7th century. St Willibrord\r\nfounded a monastery and church here. In 1233 the place came into the\r\npossession of the dukes of Gelderland and received the status of a town\r\nin 1247. In 1371 it fell to the duchy of Cleves, and passed with it in\r\n1609 to Brandenburg. The town joined the Hanseatic League in 1407. In\r\n1794 it was bombarded by the French under General Vandamme, and in 1806\r\nit was assigned to the grand-duchy of Berg. It passed into the\r\npossession of Prussia in 1815.\r\n\r\n  See A. Dederich, _Annalen der Stadt Emmerich_ (Emmerich, 1867).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMMET, ROBERT (1778-1803), Irish rebel, youngest son of Robert Emmet,\r\nphysician to the lord-lieutenant of Ireland, was born in Dublin in 1778,\r\nand entered Trinity College in October 1793, where he had a\r\ndistinguished academic career, showing special aptitude for mathematics\r\nand chemistry, and acquiring a reputation as an orator. Without taking a\r\ndegree he removed his name from the college books in April 1798, as a\r\nprotest against the inquisitorial examination of the political views of\r\nthe students conducted by Lord Clare as chancellor of the university.\r\nThus cut off from entering a learned profession, he turned towards\r\npolitical intrigue, being already to some extent in the secrets of the\r\nUnited Irishmen, of whom his elder brother Thomas Addis Emmet (see\r\nbelow) was one of the most prominent. In April 1799 a warrant was issued\r\nfor his arrest, but was not executed; and in 1800 and the following year\r\nhe travelled on the continent of Europe, where he entered into relations\r\nwith the leaders of the United Irishmen, exiled since the rebellion of\r\n1798, who were planning a fresh outbreak in Ireland in expectation of\r\nsupport from France. Emmet went to Paris in October 1802, where he had\r\nan interview with Bonaparte which convinced him that the peace of Amiens\r\nwould be of short duration and that a French invasion of England might\r\nbe looked for in August 1803. The councils of the conspirators were\r\nweakened by divided opinions as to the ultimate aim of their policy; and\r\nno clearly thought-out scheme of operations appears to have been arrived\r\nat when Emmet left Paris for Ireland in October 1802. Those in his\r\nconfidence afterwards denied that Emmet was himself the originator of\r\nthe plan on which he acted; and several of the ablest of the United\r\nIrishmen held aloof, believing the project to be impracticable. Among\r\nthe latter was Lord Cloncurry, at one time on the executive of the\r\nUnited Irishmen, with whom Emmet dined the night before he left Paris,\r\nand to whom he spoke of his plans with intense enthusiasm and\r\nexcitement. Emmet's lack of discretion was shown by his revealing his\r\nintentions in detail to an Englishman named Lawrence, resident near\r\nHonfleur, with whom he sought shelter when travelling on foot on his way\r\nto Ireland. Arriving in Dublin at the end of October he received\r\ninformation to the effect that seventeen counties were ready to take up\r\narms if a successful effort were made in Dublin. For some time he\r\nremained concealed in his father's house near Miltown, making his\r\npreparations. A large number of pikes were collected and stored in\r\nDublin during the spring of 1803, but fire-arms and ammunition were not\r\nplentiful.\r\n\r\nThe probability of a French invasion in August was increased by the\r\nrenewal of the war in May, Emmet's brother Thomas being then in Paris in\r\ncommunication with Talleyrand and Bonaparte. But a discovery by the\r\ngovernment of concealed arms, and an explosion at one of Emmet's depots\r\nin Patrick Street on the 16th of July, necessitated immediate action,\r\nand the 23rd of that month was accordingly fixed for the projected\r\nrising. An elaborate plan of operations, which he described in detail in\r\na letter to his brother after his arrest, had been prepared by Emmet,\r\nthe leading feature of which was a simultaneous attack on the castle,\r\nthe Pigeon House and the artillery barracks at Island bridge; while\r\nbodies of insurgents from the neighbouring counties were to march on the\r\ncapital. But the whole scheme miscarried. Some of Emmet's bolder\r\nproposals, such as a plan for capturing the commander-in-chief, were\r\nvetoed by the timidity of his associates, none of whom were men of any\r\nability. On the 23rd of July all was confusion at the depots, and the\r\nleaders were divided as to the course to be pursued; orders were not\r\nobeyed; a trusted messenger despatched for arms absconded with the money\r\ncommitted to him to pay for them; treachery, quite unsuspected by Emmet,\r\nhoneycombed the conspiracy; the Wicklow contingent failed to appear; the\r\nKildare men turned back on hearing that the rising had been postponed; a\r\nsignal expected by a contingent at the Broadstone was never given. In\r\nthis hopeless state of affairs a false report reached Emmet at one of\r\nhis depots at nine o'clock in the evening that the military were\r\napproaching. Without taking any step to verify it, Emmet put on a green\r\nand white uniform and placed himself at the head of some eighty men, who\r\nmarched towards the castle, being joined in the streets by a second body\r\nof about equal strength. None of these insurgents had any discipline,\r\nand many of them were drunk. Lord Kilwarden, proceeding to a hastily\r\nsummoned meeting of the privy council, was dragged from his carriage by\r\nthis rabble and murdered, together with his nephew Richard Wolfe; his\r\ndaughter who accompanied him being conveyed to safety by Emmet himself.\r\nEmmet, now seeing that the rising had become a mere street brawl, made\r\nhis escape; a detachment of soldiers quickly dispersed his followers.\r\n\r\nAfter hiding for some days in the Wicklow mountains Emmet repaired to\r\nthe house of a Mrs Palmer at Harold's Cross, in order to be near the\r\nresidence of John Philpot Curran (q.v.), to whose daughter Sarah he had\r\nfor some time been secretly attached, and with whom he had carried on a\r\nvoluminous correspondence, afterwards seized by the authorities at her\r\nfather's house. Attempting without success to persuade this lady to fly\r\nwith him to America, Emmet lingered in the neighbourhood till the 25th\r\nof August, when he was apprehended by Major H.C. Sirr, the same officer\r\nwho had captured Lord Edward Fitzgerald in 1798. At his trial he was\r\ndefended and betrayed by the infamous Leonard MacNally (q.v.), and was\r\nconvicted of treason; and after delivering an eloquent speech from the\r\ndock, was hanged on the 20th of September 1803.\r\n\r\nBy the universal testimony of his friends, Robert Emmet was a youth of\r\nmodest character, pure motives and winning personality. But he was\r\nentirely lacking in practical statesmanship. Brought up in a\r\nrevolutionary atmosphere, his enthusiasm was uncontrolled by judgment.\r\nThomas Moore, who warmly eulogizes Emmet, with whom he was a student at\r\nTrinity College, records that one day when he was playing on the piano\r\nthe melody \"Let Erin remember,\" Emmet started up exclaiming\r\npassionately, \"Oh, that I were at the head of 20,000 men marching to\r\nthat air!\" He had no knowledge of the world or of men; he trusted every\r\none with child-like simplicity; except personal courage he had none of\r\nthe qualities essential to leadership in such an enterprise as armed\r\nrebellion. The romance of his love affair with Sarah Curran--who\r\nafterwards married Robert Henry Sturgeon, an officer distinguished in\r\nthe Peninsular War--has cast a glamour over the memory of Robert Emmet;\r\nand it inspired Thomas Moore's well-known songs, \"She is far from the\r\nland where her young hero sleeps,\" and \"Oh, breathe not his name\"; it is\r\nalso the subject of Washington Irving's \"The Broken Heart.\" Emmet was\r\nshort and slight in figure; his face was marked by smallpox, and he was\r\ndescribed in 1803 for the purpose of identification as being \"of an\r\nugly, sour countenance and dirty brown complexion.\" A few poems by Emmet\r\nof little merit are appended to Madden's biography.\r\n\r\n  See R.R.

(R. J.

After visiting the chief medical schools\r\non the continent, he returned to Ireland in 1788; but the sudden death\r\nof his elder brother, Christopher Temple Emmet (1761-1788), a barrister\r\nof some distinction, induced him to follow the advice of Sir James\r\nMackintosh to forsake medicine for the law as a profession. He was\r\ncalled to the Irish bar in 1790, and quickly obtained a practice,\r\nprincipally as counsel for prisoners charged with political offences,\r\nand became the legal adviser of the leading United Irishmen. When the\r\nDublin corporation issued a declaration of Protestant ascendancy in\r\n1792, the counter-manifesto of the United Irishmen was drawn up by\r\nEmmet; and in 1795 he took the oath of the society in open court,\r\nbecoming secretary in the same year and a member of the executive in\r\n1797. Although Grattan had a profound contempt for Emmet's political\r\nunderstanding, describing him as a quack in politics who set up his own\r\ncrude notions as settled rules, Emmet was among the more prudent of the\r\nUnited Irishmen on the eve of the rebellion. It was only when convinced\r\nthat parliamentary reform and Catholic emancipation were not to be\r\nobtained by constitutional methods, that he reluctantly engaged in\r\ntreasonable conspiracy; and in opposition to bolder spirits like Lord\r\nEdward Fitzgerald, he discountenanced the taking up of arms until help\r\nshould be obtained from France. Though not among those taken at the\r\nhouse of Oliver Bond on the 12th of March 1798 (see FITZGERALD, LORD\r\nEDWARD), he was arrested about the same time, and he was one of the\r\nleaders who after the rebellion were imprisoned at Fort George till\r\n1802. Being then released, he went to Brussels, where he was visited by\r\nhis brother Robert in October of that year; and he was in the secrets of\r\nthose who were preparing for a fresh rising in Ireland in conjunction\r\nwith French aid. After the failure of Robert Emmet's rising in July\r\n1803, the news of which reached him in Paris, where he was in\r\ncommunication with Bonaparte, he emigrated to the United States. Joining\r\nthe New York bar he obtained a lucrative practice and in 1812-13 was\r\nattorney-general of New York; his abilities and success being such that\r\nJudge Story declared him to be \"by universal consent in the first rank\r\nof American advocates.\" He died while conducting a case in court on the\r\n14th of November 1827. Thomas Emmet married, in 1791, Jane, daughter of\r\nthe Rev. John Patten, of Clonmel.\r\n\r\n  See authorities under EMMET, ROBERT; also Alfred Webb, _Compendium of\r\n  Irish Biography_ (Dublin, 1878); C.S.

He started the \"negro minstrel\" performances, which\r\nfrom 1842 onwards became so popular in America and England, and he\r\ncomposed a number of songs which had a great temporary vogue. He is\r\nremembered particularly as the writer of the famous Southern war-song\r\n\"Dixie,\" which he composed in 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMMITSBURG, a town in Frederick county, Maryland, U.S.A., 61 m. by rail\r\nW. by N. of Baltimore, and 1-1/2 m. S. of the northern boundary of the\r\nstate. Pop. (1900) 849; (1910) 1054. It is served by the Emmitsburg\r\nrailway (7 m. long) to Rocky Ridge on the Western Maryland railway. The\r\ntown is in a picturesque region on the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge\r\nMountains. Two miles S.W. is Mount St. Mary's College (Roman Catholic),\r\nfounded in 1808 by the Rev. John du Bois (1764-1842)--its president\r\nuntil 1826, when he became bishop of New York--and chartered by the\r\nstate in 1830. The Ecclesiastical Seminary of the college has been a\r\ngreat training school, and has been called the \"Nursery of Bishops\";\r\namong its graduates have been Bishop Hughes, Cardinal McCloskey and\r\nArchbishop Corrigan. In 1908 the college had 25 instructors and 350\r\nstudents, of whom 57 were in the Ecclesiastical Seminary, and 61 in the\r\nMinim Department. Half a mile S. of the town is St Joseph's College and\r\nAcademy (incorporated in 1816), for young women, which is conducted by\r\nthe Sisters of Charity--this order was introduced into the United States\r\nat Emmitsburg by Mrs Elizabeth Ann Seton in 1809. The first settlement\r\nat Emmitsburg was made about 1773. It was at first called \"Silver\r\nFancy,\" and then for a time was known as \"Poplar Fields\"; but in 1786\r\nthe present name was adopted in honour of William Emmitt, one of the\r\noriginal settlers. The town was incorporated in 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMMIUS, UBBO (1547-1625), Dutch historian and geographer, was born at\r\nGretha in East Friesland on the 5th of December 1547. After studying at\r\nRostock, he spent two years in Geneva, where he became intimate with\r\nTheodore Beza; and returning to the Netherlands was appointed the\r\nprincipal of a college at Norden, a position which he lost in 1587\r\nbecause, as a Calvinist, he would not subscribe to the confession of\r\nAugsburg. Subsequently he was head of a college at Leer, and in 1594\r\nbecame rector of the college at Groningen, and when in 1614 this college\r\nbecame a university he was chosen principal and professor of history and\r\nGreek, and by his wise guidance and his learning speedily raised the new\r\nuniversity to a position of eminence. He was on friendly terms with\r\nLouis, count of Nassau; corresponded with many of the learned men of his\r\ntime; and died at Groningen on the 9th of December 1625. He was twice\r\nmarried, and left a son and a daughter. The chief works of Emmius are:\r\n_Rerum Frisicarum historiae decades_, in six parts, a complete edition\r\nof which was published at Leiden in 1616; _Opus chronologicum_\r\n(Groningen, 1619); _Vetus Graecia illustrata_ (Leiden, 1626); and\r\n_Historia temporis nostri_, which was first published at Groningen in\r\n1732. An account of his life, written by Nicholas Mulerius, was\r\npublished, with the lives of other professors of Groningen, at Groningen\r\nin 1638.\r\n\r\n  See N.G. van Kampen, _Geschiedenis der letteren en wetenschappen in de\r\n  Nederlanden_ (The Hague, 1821-1826).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMMONS, EBENEZER (1800-1863), American geologist, was born at\r\nMiddlefield, Massachusetts, on the 16th of May 1800. He studied medicine\r\nat Albany, and after taking his degree practised for some years in\r\nBerkshire county. His interest in geology was kindled in early life, and\r\nin 1824 he had assisted Prof. Chester Dewey (1784-1867) in preparing a\r\ngeological map of Berkshire county, in which the first attempt was made\r\nto classify the rocks of the Taconic area. While thus giving much of his\r\ntime to natural science, undertaking professional work in natural\r\nhistory and geology in Williams College, he also accepted the\r\nprofessorship of chemistry and afterwards of obstetrics in the Albany\r\nMedical College. The chief work of his life was, however, in geology,\r\nand he has been designated by Jules Marcou as \"the founder of American\r\npalaeozoic stratigraphy, and the first discoverer of the primordial\r\nfauna in any country.\" In 1836 he became attached to the Geological\r\nSurvey of the State of New York, and after lengthened study he grouped\r\nthe local strata (1842) into the Taconic and overlying New York systems.\r\nThe latter system was subdivided into several groups that were by no\r\nmeans well defined. Emmons had previously described the Potsdam\r\nsandstone (1838), and this was placed at the base of the New York\r\nsystem. It is now regarded as Upper Cambrian. In 1844 Emmons for the\r\nfirst time obtained fossils in his Taconic system: a notable discovery\r\nbecause the species obtained were found to differ from all then-known\r\nPalaeozoic fossils, and they were regarded as representing the\r\nprimordial group. Marcou was thus led to advocate that the term Taconic\r\nbe generally adopted in place of Cambrian. Nevertheless the Taconic\r\nfauna of Emmons has proved to include only the lower part of Sedgwick's\r\nCambrian. Considerable discussion has taken place on the question of the\r\nTaconic system, and whether the term should be adopted; and the general\r\nopinion has been adverse. Emmons made contributions on agriculture and\r\ngeology to a series of volumes on the natural history of New York. He\r\nalso issued a work entitled _American Geology; containing a statement of\r\nthe principles of the Science, with full illustrations of the\r\ncharacteristic American Fossils_ (1855-1857). From 1851 to 1860 he was\r\nstate geologist of North Carolina. He died at Brunswick, North Carolina,\r\non the 1st of October 1863.\r\n\r\n  See the _Biographical Notice of Ebenezer Emmons_, by J. Marcou; _Amer.\r\n  Geologist_, vol. vii. (Jan., 1891), p. 1 (with portrait and list of\r\n  publications).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMMONS, NATHANAEL (1745-1840), American theologian, was born at East\r\nHaddam, Connecticut, on the 20th of April 1745. He graduated at Yale in\r\n1767, studied theology under the Rev. John Smalley (1734-1820) at\r\nBerlin, Connecticut, and was licensed to preach in 1769. After preaching\r\nfour years in New York and New Hampshire, he became, in April 1773,\r\npastor of the Second church at Franklin (until 1778 a part of Wrentham,\r\nMassachusetts), of which he remained in charge until May 1827, when\r\nfailing health compelled his relinquishment of active ministerial cares.\r\nHe lived, however, for many years thereafter, dying of old age at\r\nFranklin on the 23rd of September 1840. It was as a theologian that Dr\r\nEmmons was best known, and for half a century probably no clergyman in\r\nNew England exerted so wide an influence. He developed an original\r\nsystem of divinity, somewhat on the structural plan of that of Samuel\r\nHopkins, and, in Emmons's own belief, contained in and evolved from\r\nHopkinsianism. While by no means abandoning the tenets of the old\r\nCalvinistic faith, he came to be looked upon as the chief representative\r\nof what was then known as the \"new school\" of theologians. His system\r\ndeclared that holiness and sin are free voluntary exercises; that men\r\nact freely under the divine agency; that the slightest transgression\r\ndeserves eternal punishment; that it is through God's mere grace that\r\nthe penitent believer is pardoned and justified; that, in spite of total\r\ndepravity, sinners ought to repent; and that regeneration is active, not\r\npassive, with the believer. Emmonsism was spread and perpetuated by more\r\nthan a hundred clergymen, whom he personally trained. Politically, he\r\nwas an ardent patriot during the War of Independence, and a strong\r\nFederalist afterwards, several of his political discourses attracting\r\nwide attention. He was a founder and the first president of the\r\nMassachusetts Missionary Society, and was influential in the\r\nestablishment of Andover Theological Seminary. More than two hundred of\r\nhis sermons and addresses were published during his lifetime. His\r\n_Works_ were published in 6 vols. (Boston, 1842; new edition, 1861).\r\n\r\n  See also the _Memoir_, by Dr E.A. Park (Andover, 1861).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPEDOCLES (c. 490-430 B.C.), Greek philosopher and statesman, was\r\nBorn at Agrigentum (Acragas, Girgenti) in Sicily of a distinguished\r\nfamily, then at the height of its glory. His grandfather Empedocles was\r\nvictorious in the Olympian chariot race in 496; in 470 his father Meto\r\nwas largely instrumental in the overthrow of the tyrant Thrasydaeus. We\r\nknow almost nothing of his life. The numerous legends which have grown\r\nup round his name yield very little that can fairly be regarded as\r\nauthentic. It seems that he carried on the democratic tradition of his\r\nhouse by helping to overthrow an oligarchic government which succeeded\r\nthe tyranny in Agrigentum, and was invited by the citizens to become\r\ntheir king. That he refused the honour may have been due to a real\r\nenthusiasm for free institutions or to the prudential recognition of the\r\nperil which in those turbulent times surrounded the royal dignity.\r\nUltimately a change in the balance of parties compelled him to leave the\r\ncity, and he died in the Peloponnese of the results of an accident in\r\n430.\r\n\r\nOf his poem on nature ([Greek: physis]) there are left about 400 lines\r\nin unequal fragments out of the original 5000; of the hymns of\r\npurification ([Greek: katharmoi]) less than 100 verses remain; of the\r\nother works, improbably assigned to him, nothing is known. His grand\r\nbut obscure hexameters, after the example of Parmenides, delighted\r\nLucretius. Aristotle, it is said, called him the father of rhetoric. But\r\nit was as at once statesman, prophet, physicist, physician and reformer\r\nthat he most impressed the popular imagination. To his contemporaries,\r\nas to himself, he seemed more than a mere man. The Sicilians honoured\r\nhis august aspect as he moved amongst them with purple robes and golden\r\ngirdle, with long hair bound by a Delphic garland, and brazen sandals on\r\nhis feet, and with a retinue of slaves behind him. Stories were told of\r\nthe ingenuity and generosity by which he had made the marshes round\r\nSelinus salubrious, of the grotesque device by which he laid the winds\r\nthat ruined the harvests of Agrigentum, and of the almost miraculous\r\nrestoration to life of a woman who had long lain in a death-like trance.\r\nLegends stranger still told of his disappearance from among men.\r\nEmpedocles, according to one story, was one midnight, after a feast held\r\nin his honour, called away in a blaze of glory to the gods; according to\r\nanother, he had only thrown himself into the crater of Etna, in the hope\r\nthat men, finding no traces of his end, would suppose him translated to\r\nheaven. But his hopes were cheated by the volcano, which cast forth his\r\nbrazen sandals and betrayed his secret (Diog. Laert. viii. 67). The\r\npeople of Agrigentum have never ceased to honour his name, and even in\r\nmodern times he has been celebrated by followers of Mazzini as the\r\ndemocrat of antiquity _par excellence_.\r\n\r\nAs his history is uncertain, so his doctrines are hard to put together.\r\nHe does not belong to any one definite school. While, on one hand, he\r\ncombines much that had been suggested by Parmenides, Pythagoras and the\r\nIonic schools, he has germs of truth that Plato and Aristotle afterwards\r\ndeveloped; he is at once a firm believer in Orphic mysteries, and a\r\nscientific thinker, precursor of the physical scientists. There are,\r\naccording to Empedocles, four ultimate elements, four primal divinities,\r\nof which are made all structures in the world--fire, air, water, earth.\r\nThese four elements are eternally brought into union, and eternally\r\nparted from each other, by two divine beings or powers, love and\r\nhatred--an attractive and a repulsive force which the ordinary eye can\r\nsee working amongst men, but which really pervade the whole world.\r\nAccording to the different proportions in which these four\r\nindestructible and unchangeable matters are combined with each other is\r\nthe difference of the organic structure produced; e.g. flesh and blood\r\nare made of equal (in weight but not in volume) parts of all four\r\nelements, whereas bones are one-half fire, one-fourth earth, and\r\none-fourth water. It is in the aggregation and segregation of elements\r\nthus arising that Empedocles, like the atomists, finds the real process\r\nwhich corresponds to what is popularly termed growth, increase or\r\ndecrease. Nothing new comes or can come into being; the only change that\r\ncan occur is a change in the juxtaposition of element with element.\r\n\r\nEmpedocles apparently regarded love ([Greek: philotes]) and discord\r\n([Greek: neikos]) as alternately holding the empire over\r\nthings,--neither, however, being ever quite absent. As the best and\r\noriginal state, he seems to have conceived a period when love was\r\npredominant, and all the elements formed one great sphere or globe.\r\nSince that period discord had gained more sway; and the actual world was\r\nfull of contrasts and oppositions, due to the combined action of both\r\nprinciples. His theory attempted to explain the separation of elements,\r\nthe formation of earth and sea, of sun and moon, of atmosphere. But the\r\nmost interesting and most matured part of his views dealt with the first\r\norigin of plants and animals, and with the physiology of man. As the\r\nelements (his deities) entered into combinations, there appeared quaint\r\nresults--heads without necks, arms without shoulders. Then as these\r\nfragmentary structures met, there were seen horned heads on human\r\nbodies, bodies of oxen with men's heads, and figures of double sex. But\r\nmost of these products of natural forces disappeared as suddenly as they\r\narose; only in those rare cases where the several parts were found\r\nadapted to each other, and casual member fitted into casual member, did\r\nthe complex structures thus formed last. Thus from spontaneous\r\naggregations of casual aggregates, which suited each other as if this\r\nhad been intended, did the organic universe originally spring. Soon\r\nvarious influences reduced the creatures of double sex to a male and a\r\nfemale, and the world was replenished with organic life. It is\r\nimpossible not to see in this theory a crude anticipation of the\r\n\"survival of the fittest\" theory of modern evolutionists.\r\n\r\nAs man, animal and plant are composed of the same elements in different\r\nproportions, there is an identity of nature in them all. They all have\r\nsense and understanding; in man, however, and especially in the blood at\r\nhis heart, mind has its peculiar seat. But mind is always dependent upon\r\nthe body, and varies with its changing constitution. Hence the precepts\r\nof morality are with Empedocles largely dietetic.\r\n\r\nKnowledge is explained by the principle that the several elements in the\r\nthings outside us are perceived by the corresponding elements in\r\nourselves. We know only in so far as we have within us a nature cognate\r\nto the object of knowledge. Like is known by like. The whole body is\r\nfull of pores, and hence respiration takes place over the whole frame.\r\nBut in the organs of sense these pores are specially adapted to receive\r\nthe effluxes which are continually rising from bodies around us; and in\r\nthis way perception is somewhat obscurely explained. The theory, however\r\nunsatisfactory as an explanation, has one great merit, that it\r\nrecognizes between the eye, for instance, and the object seen an\r\nintermediate something. Certain particles go forth from the eye to meet\r\nsimilar particles given forth from the object, and the resultant contact\r\nconstitutes vision. This idea contains within it the germ of the modern\r\nidea of the subjectivity of sense-given data; perception is not merely a\r\npassive reflection of external objects.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to harmonize these quasi-scientific theories with the\r\ntheory of transmigration of souls which Empedocles seems to expound.\r\nProbably the doctrine that the divinity ([Greek: daimon]) passes from\r\nelement to element, nowhere finding a home, is a mystical way of\r\nteaching the continued identity of the principles which are at the\r\nbottom of every phase of development from inorganic nature to man. At\r\nthe top of the scale are the prophet and the physician, those who have\r\nbest learned the secret of life; they are next to the divine. One law,\r\nan identity of elements, pervades all nature; existence is one from end\r\nto end; the plant and the animal are links in a chain where man is a\r\nlink too; and even the distinction between male and female is\r\ntranscended. The beasts are kindred with man; he who eats their flesh is\r\nnot much better than a cannibal.\r\n\r\nLooking at the opposition between these and the ordinary opinions, we\r\nare not surprised that Empedocles notes the limitation and narrowness of\r\nhuman perceptions. We see, he says, but a part, and fancy that we have\r\ngrasped the whole. But the senses cannot lead to truth; thought and\r\nreflection must look at the thing on every side. It is the business of a\r\nphilosopher, while he lays bare the fundamental difference of elements,\r\nto display the identity that subsists between what seem unconnected\r\nparts of the universe.\r\n\r\n  See Diog.

W.; X.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPEROR (Fr. _empereur_, from the Lat. _imperator_), a title formerly\r\nborne by the sovereigns of the Roman empire (see EMPIRE), and since\r\ntheir time, partly by derivation, partly by imitation, used by a variety\r\nof other sovereigns. Under the Republic, the term _imperator_ applied in\r\ntheory to any magistrate vested with _imperium_; but in practice it was\r\nonly used of a magistrate who was acting abroad (_militiae_) and was\r\nthus in command of troops. The term _imperator_ was the natural and\r\nregular designation employed by his troops in addressing such a\r\nmagistrate; but it was more particularly and specially employed by them\r\nto salute him after a victory; and when he had been thus saluted he\r\ncould use the title of imperator in public till the day of his triumph\r\nat Rome, after which it would lapse along with his _imperium_. The\r\nsenate itself might, in the later Republic, invite a victorious general\r\nto assume the title; and in these two customs--the salutation of the\r\ntroops, and the invitation of the senate--we see in the germ the two\r\nmethods by which under the Empire the _princeps_ was designated; while\r\nin the military connotation attaching to the name even under the\r\nRepublic we can detect in advance the military character by which the\r\nemperor and the Empire were afterwards distinguished. Julius Caesar was\r\nthe first who used the title continuously (from 58 B.C. to his death in\r\n44 B.C.), as well _domi_ as _militiae_; and his nephew Augustus took a\r\nfurther step when he made the term imperator a _praenomen_, a practice\r\nwhich after the time of Nero becomes regular. But apart from this\r\namalgamation of the term with his regular name, and the private right to\r\nits use which that bestowed, every emperor had an additional and double\r\nright to the title on public grounds, possessed as he was of an\r\n_imperium infinitum majus_, and commanding as he did all the troops of\r\nthe Empire. From the latter point of view--as _generalissimo_ of the\r\nforces of Rome, he had the right to the insignia of the commander (the\r\nlaurel wreath and the fasces), and to the protection of a bodyguard, the\r\n_praetoriani_. This public title of imperator was normally conferred by\r\nthe senate; and an emperor normally dates his reign from the day of his\r\nsalutation by the senate. But the troops were also regarded as still\r\nretaining the right of saluting an _imperator_; and there were emperors\r\nwho regarded themselves as created by such salutation and dated their\r\nreigns accordingly. The military associations of the term thus resulted,\r\nonly too often, in making the emperor the nominee of a turbulent\r\nsoldiery.\r\n\r\nAugustus had been designated (not indeed officially, but none the less\r\nregularly) as _princeps_--the first citizen or foremost man of the\r\nstate. The designation suited the early years of the Empire, in which a\r\ndyarchy of _princeps_ and senate had been maintained. But by the 2nd\r\ncentury the dyarchy is passing into a monarchy: the title of princeps\r\nrecedes, and the title of imperator comes into prominence to designate\r\nnot merely the possessor of a certain _imperium_, or the general of\r\ntroops, but the simple monarch in the fulness of his power as head of\r\nthe state. From the days of Diocletian one finds occasionally two\r\nemperors, but not, at any rate in theory, two Empires; the two emperors\r\nare the dual sovereigns of a single realm. But from the time of Arcadius\r\nand Honorius (A.D. 395) there are in reality (though not in theory) two\r\nEmpires as well as two emperors, one of the East and one of the West.\r\nWhen Greek became the sole language of the East Roman Empire,\r\n_imperator_ was rendered sometimes by [Greek: basileus] and sometimes by\r\n[Greek: autokrator], the former word being the usual designation of a\r\nsovereign, the latter specially denoting that despotic power which the\r\n_imperator_ held, and being in fact the official translation of\r\n_imperator_. Justinian uses [Greek: autokrator] as his formal title, and\r\n[Greek: basileus] as the popular term.\r\n\r\nOn the revival of the Roman empire in the West by Charlemagne in 800,\r\nthe title (at first in the form _imperator_, or _imperator_ _Augustus_,\r\nafterwards _Romanorum imperator Augustus_) was taken by him and by his\r\nFrankish, Italian and German successors, heads of the Holy Roman Empire,\r\ndown to the abdication of the emperor Francis II. in 1806. The doctrine\r\nhad, however, grown up in the earlier middle ages (about the time of the\r\nemperor Henry II., 1002-1024) that although the emperor was chosen in\r\nGermany (at first by the nation, afterwards by a small body of\r\nelectors), and entitled from the moment of his election to be crowned in\r\nRome by the pope, he could not use the title of emperor until that\r\ncoronation had actually taken place. The German sovereign, therefore,\r\nthough he exercised, as soon as chosen, full imperial powers both in\r\nGermany and Italy, called himself merely \"king of the Romans\"\r\n(_Romanorum rex semper Augustus_) until he had received the sacred crown\r\nin the sacred city. In 1508 Maximilian I., being refused a passage to\r\nRome by the Venetians, obtained from Pope Julius II. a bull permitting\r\nhim to style himself emperor elect (_imperator electus_, erwahlter\r\nKaiser). This title was taken by Ferdinand I. (1558) and all succeeding\r\nemperors, immediately upon their coronation in Germany; and it was until\r\n1806 their strict legal designation, and was always employed by them in\r\nproclamations and other official documents. The term \"elect\" was,\r\nhowever, omitted even in formal documents when the sovereign was\r\naddressed or was spoken of in the third person.\r\n\r\nIn medieval times the emperor, conceived as vicegerent of God and\r\nco-regent with the pope in government of the Christian people committed\r\nto his charge, might almost be regarded as an ecclesiastical officer.\r\nNot only was his function regarded as consisting in the defence and\r\nextension of true religion; he was himself arrayed in ecclesiastical\r\nvestments at his coronation; he was ordained a subdeacon; and assisting\r\nthe pope in the celebration of the Eucharist, he communicated in both\r\nkinds as a clerk. The same sort of ecclesiastical character came also to\r\nbe attached to the tsars[1] of Russia, who--especially in their\r\nrelations with the Orthodox Eastern Church--may vindicate for themselves\r\n(though the sultans of Turkey have disputed the claim) the succession to\r\nthe East Roman emperors (see Empire). But the title of emperor was also\r\nused in the middle ages, and is still used, in a loose and vague sense,\r\nwithout any ecclesiastical connotation or hint of connexion with Rome\r\n(the two attributes which should properly distinguish an emperor), and\r\nmerely in order to designate a non-European ruler with a large extent of\r\nterritory. It was thus applied, and is still applied, to the rulers of\r\nChina and Japan; it was attributed to the Mogul sovereigns of India; and\r\nsince 1876 it has been used by British monarchs in their capacity of\r\nsovereigns of India (_Kaiser-i-Hind_).[2]\r\n\r\nSince the French Revolution and during the course of the 19th century\r\nthe term emperor has had an eventful history. In 1804 Napoleon took the\r\ntitle of \"Emperor of the French,\" and posed as the reviver of the Empire\r\nof Charlemagne. Afraid that Napoleon would next proceed to deprive him\r\nof his title of Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II. first took the step, in\r\n1804, of investing himself with a new title, that of \"Hereditary Emperor\r\nof Austria,\" and then, in 1806, proceeded to the further step of\r\nabdicating his old historical title and dissolving the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire. Thus the old and true sense of the term emperor--the sense in\r\nwhich it was connected with the church in the present and with Rome in\r\nthe past--finally perished; and the term became partly an apanage of\r\nBonapartism (Louis Napoleon resuscitated it as Napoleon III. in 1853),\r\nand partly a personal title of the Habsburgs as rulers of their various\r\nfamily territories. In 1870, however, a new and most important use of\r\nthe title was begun, when the union of Germany was achieved, and the\r\nPrussian king, who became the head of united Germany, received in that\r\ncapacity the title of German Emperor. Here the title of emperor\r\ndesignates the president of a federal state; and here the Holy Roman\r\nemperor of the 17th and 18th centuries, the president of a loose\r\nconfederation of German states, may be said to have found his successor.\r\nBut the term has been widely and loosely used in the course of the 19th\r\ncentury. It was the style from 1821 to 1889 of the princes of the house\r\nof Braganza who ruled in Brazil; it has been assumed by usurpers in\r\nHaiti, and in Mexico it was borne by Augustin Iturbide in 1822 and 1823,\r\nand by the ill-fated Archduke Maximilian of Austria from 1864 to 1867.\r\nIt can hardly, therefore, be said to have any definite descriptive force\r\nat the present time, such as it had in the middle ages. So far as it has\r\nany such force in Europe, it may be said partly to be connected with\r\nBonapartism, and to denote a popular but military dictatorship, partly\r\nto be connected with the federal idea, and to denote a precedence over\r\nother kings possessed by a ruler standing at the head of a composite\r\nstate which may embrace kings among its members. It is in this latter\r\nsense that it is used of Germany, and of Britain in respect of India; it\r\nis in something approaching this latter sense that it may be said to be\r\nused of Austria.\r\n\r\n  See J. Selden, _Titles of Honour_ (1672); J. Bryce, _Holy Roman\r\n  Empire_ (London, 1904); and Sir E. Colebrooke, \"On Imperial and Other\r\n  Titles\" in the _Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society_ (1877).

Br.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] The word _Tsar_, like the German _Kaiser_, is derived from Caesar\r\n    (see TSAR). Peter the Great introduced the use of the style\r\n    \"Imperator,\" and the official designation is now \"Emperor of all the\r\n    Russias, Tsar of Poland, and Grand Duke of Finland,\" though the term\r\n    tsar is still popularly used in Russia.\r\n\r\n  [2] For the titles of [Greek: Basileus], _imperator Augustus_, &c.,\r\n    applied in the 10th century to the Anglo-Saxon kings, see EMPIRE\r\n    (note). The claim to the style of emperor, as a badge of equal rank,\r\n    played a considerable part in the diplomatic relations between the\r\n    Sultan and certain European sovereigns. Thus, at a time when this\r\n    style (_Padishah_) was refused by the Sultan to the tsars of Russia,\r\n    and even to the Holy Roman Emperor himself, it was allowed to the\r\n    French kings, who in diplomatic correspondence and treaties with\r\n    Turkey called themselves \"emperor of France\" (_empereur de\r\n    France_).--[ED.].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPHYSEMA (Gr. [Greek: emphysan] to inflate) is a word vaguely meaning\r\nthe abnormal presence of air in certain parts of the body. At the\r\npresent day, however, there are two conditions to which it refers,\r\n\"pulmonary emphysema\" (and the word pulmonary is often omitted) and\r\n\"surgical emphysema.\" Of pulmonary emphysema there are two forms, true\r\nvesicular and interstitial (or interlobular). Vesicular emphysema\r\nsignifies that there is an enlargement of air-vesicles, resulting either\r\nfrom their excessive distension, from destruction of the septa, or from\r\nboth causes combined (see RESPIRATORY SYSTEM). In interstitial emphysema\r\nthe air is infiltrated into the connective tissue beneath the pleura and\r\nbetween the pulmonary air-cells.\r\n\r\nThe former variety is by far the more common, and appears to be capable\r\nof being produced by various causes, the chief of which are the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n1. Where a portion of the lung has become wasted, or its vesicular\r\nstructure permanently obliterated by disease, without corresponding\r\nfalling in of the chest wall, the neighbouring air-vesicles or some of\r\nthem undergo dilatation to fill the vacuum (vicarious emphysema).\r\n\r\n2. In some cases of bronchitis, where numbers of the smaller bronchial\r\ntubes become obstructed, the air in the pulmonary vesicles remains\r\nimprisoned, the force of expiration being insufficient to expel it;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the stronger force of inspiration being\r\nadequate to overcome the resistance, the air-cells tend to become more\r\nand more distended, and permanent alterations in their structure,\r\nincluding emphysema, are the result (inspiratory theory).\r\n\r\n3. Emphysema also arises from exertion involving violent expiratory\r\nefforts, during which the glottis is constricted, as in paroxysms of\r\ncoughing, in straining, and in lifting heavy weights (expiratory\r\ntheory). Whooping-cough is well known as the exciting cause of emphysema\r\nin many persons.\r\n\r\n4. Another view, known as the nutritive theory, maintains that emphysema\r\ndepends essentially on a primary nutritive change in the walls of the\r\nair-vesicles. Thus these are impaired in their resisting power, and are\r\nfar more likely to become distended by any force acting on them from\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n5. Again in certain cases the cartilages of the chest become\r\nhypertrophied and rigid, thus causing a primary chronic enlargement, and\r\nthe lungs become emphysematous in order to fill up the increased space\r\n(Freund's theory).\r\n\r\nIn whatever manner produced, this disease gives rise to important morbid\r\nchanges in the affected portions of the lungs, especially the loss of\r\nthe natural elasticity of the air-cells, and likewise the destruction of\r\nmany of the pulmonary capillary blood-vessels, and the diminution of\r\naerating surface for the blood. As a consequence an increased strain is\r\nthrown on the right ventricle with a consequent dilatation leading on to\r\nheart failure and all its attendant troubles. The chief symptom in this\r\ncomplaint is shortness of breath, more or less constant but greatly\r\naggravated by exertion, and by attacks of bronchitis, to which persons\r\nsuffering from emphysema appear to be specially liable. The respiration\r\nis of similar character to that already described in the case of asthma.\r\nIn severe forms of the disease the patient comes to acquire a peculiar\r\npuffy or bloated appearance, and the configuration of the chest is\r\naltered, assuming the character known as the _barrel-shaped_ or\r\n_emphysematous_ chest.\r\n\r\nThe main element in the treatment of emphysema consists in attention to\r\nthe general condition of the health, and in the avoidance of all causes\r\nlikely to aggravate the disease or induce its complications. Compressed\r\nair baths and expiration into rarefied air may be useful. During attacks\r\nof urgent dyspnoea and lividity, with engorgement of veins, the patient\r\nshould be repeatedly bled until relief is obtained. Interstitial\r\nemphysema arising from the rupture of air-cells in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the pleura may occur as a complication of the vesicular\r\nform, or separately as the result of some sudden expulsive effort, such\r\nas a fit of coughing, or, as has frequently happened, in parturition.\r\nGangrene or post-mortem decomposition may lead to the presence of air in\r\nthe interstitial tissue of the lung. Occasionally the air infiltrates\r\nthe cellular tissue of the posterior mediastinum, and thence comes to\r\ndistend the integument of the whole surface of the body (surgical\r\nemphysema). Surgical emphysema signifies the effusion of air into the\r\ngeneral connective tissues of the body. The commonest causes are a wound\r\nof some air-passage, or a penetrating wound of the chest wall without\r\ninjury to the lung. It may, however, occur in any situation of the body\r\nand in many other ways. Its severity varies from very slight cases where\r\nonly a little crepitation may be felt under the skin, to extreme cases\r\nwhere the whole body is blown up and death is imminent from impeded\r\nrespiration and failure of the action of the heart. In the milder cases\r\nno treatment is necessary as the air gradually becomes absorbed, but in\r\nthe more severe cases incisions must be made in the swollen cellular\r\ntissues to allow the air to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPIRE, a term now used to denote a state of large size and also (as a\r\nrule) of composite character, often, but not necessarily, ruled by an\r\nemperor--a state which may be a federation, like the German empire, or a\r\nunitary state, like the Russian, or even, like the British empire, a\r\nloose commonwealth of free states united to a number of subordinate\r\ndependencies. For many centuries the writers of the Church, basing\r\nthemselves on the Apocalyptic writings, conceived of a cycle of four\r\nempires, generally explained--though there was no absolute unanimity\r\nwith regard to the members of the cycle--as the Assyrian, the Persian,\r\nthe Macedonian and the Roman. But in reality the conception of Empire,\r\nlike the term itself (Lat. _imperium_), is of Roman origin. The empire\r\nof Alexander had indeed in some ways anticipated the empire of Rome. \"In\r\nhis later years,\" Professor Bury writes, \"Alexander formed the notion of\r\nan empire, both European and Asiatic, in which the Asiatics should not\r\nbe dominated by the European invaders, but Europeans and Asiatics alike\r\nshould be ruled on an equality by a monarch, indifferent to the\r\ndistinction of Greek and barbarian, and looked upon as their own king by\r\nPersians as well as by Macedonians.\" The contemporary Cynic philosophy\r\nof cosmopolitanism harmonized with this notion, as Stoicism did later\r\nwith the practice of the Roman empire; and Alexander, like Diocletian\r\nand Constantine, accustomed a Western people to the forms of an Oriental\r\ncourt, while, like the earlier Caesars, he claimed and received the\r\nrecognition of his own divinity. But when he died in 323, his empire,\r\nwhich had barely lasted ten years, died with him; and it was divided\r\namong Diadochi who, if in some other respects (for instance, the\r\nHellenization of the East) they were heirs of their master's policy,\r\nwere destitute of the imperial conception. The work of Alexander was\r\nrather that of the forerunner than the founder. He prepared the way for\r\nthe world-empire of Rome; he made possible the rise of a universal\r\nreligion. And these are the two factors which, throughout the middle\r\nages, went together to make the thing which men called Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Roman empire.\r\n\r\nAt Rome the term _imperium_ signified generally, in its earlier use, the\r\nsovereignty of the state over the individual, a sovereignty which the\r\nRomans had disengaged with singular clearness from all other kinds of\r\nauthority. Each of the higher magistrates of the Roman people was\r\nvested, by a _lex curiata_ (for power was distinctly conceived as\r\nresident in, and delegated by, the community), with an _imperium_ both\r\ncivil and military, which varied in degree with the magnitude of his\r\noffice. In the later days of the Republic such imperium was enjoyed,\r\npartly in Rome by the resident consuls and praetors, partly in the\r\nprovinces by the various proconsuls or propraetors. There was thus a\r\ncertain _morcellement_ of _imperium_, delegated as it was by the people\r\nto a number of magistrates: the coming of the Empire meant the\r\nreintegration of this _imperium_, and its unification, by a gradual\r\nprocess, in the hands of the _princeps_, or emperor. The means by which\r\nthis process was achieved had already been anticipated under the\r\nRepublic. Already in the days of Pompey it had been found convenient to\r\ngrant to an extraordinary officer an _imperium aequum_ or _majus_ over a\r\nlarge area, and that officer thus received powers, within that area,\r\nequal to, or greater than, the powers of the provincial governors. This\r\nprecedent was followed by Augustus in the year 27 B.C., when he acquired\r\nfor himself sole _imperium_ in a certain number of provinces (the\r\nimperial provinces), and an _infinitum imperium majus_ in the remaining\r\nprovinces (which were termed senatorial). As a result, Augustus enjoyed\r\nan _imperium_ coextensive indeed with the whole of the Roman world, but\r\nconcurrent, in part of that world, with the _imperium_ of the senatorial\r\nproconsuls; and the early Empire may thus be described as a dyarchy. But\r\nthe distinction between imperial and senatorial provinces finally\r\ndisappeared; by the time of Constantine the emperor enjoyed sole\r\n_imperium_, and an absolute monarchy had been established. We shall not,\r\nhowever, fully understand the significance of the Roman empire, unless\r\nwe realize the importance of its military aspect. All the soldiers of\r\nRome had from the first to swear _in verba Caesaris Augusti_; and thus\r\nthe whole of the Roman army was his army, regiments of which he might\r\nindeed lend, but of which he was sole _Imperator_ (see under EMPEROR).\r\nThus regarded as a permanent commander-in-chief, the emperor enjoyed the\r\nprivileges, and suffered from the weaknesses, of his position. He had\r\nthe power of the sword behind him; but he became more and more liable to\r\nbe deposed, and to be replaced by a new commander, at the will of those\r\nwho bore the sword in his service.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Development under Diocletian and Constantine.\r\n\r\n  Division of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe period which is marked by the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine\r\n(A.D. 284-337) marks a great transformation in the character of the\r\nEmpire. The old dyarchy, under which the emperor might still be regarded\r\nas an official of the respublica Romana, passed into a new monarchy, in\r\nwhich all political power became, as it were, the private property of\r\nthe monarch. There was now no distinction of provinces; and the old\r\npublic _aerarium_ became merely a municipal treasury, while the _fiscus_\r\nof the emperor became the exchequer of the Empire. The officers of the\r\nimperial praetorium, or bodyguard, are now the great officers of state;\r\nhis private council becomes the public consistory, or supreme court of\r\nappeal; and the _comites_ of his court are the administrators of his\r\nempire. \"All is in him, and all comes from him,\" as our own year-books\r\nsay of the medieval king; his household, for instance, is not only a\r\nhousehold, but also an administration. On the other hand, this\r\nunification seems to be accompanied by a new bifurcation. The exigencies\r\nof frontier defence had long been drawing the Empire towards the\r\ntroubled East; and this tendency reached its culmination when a new Rome\r\narose by the Bosporus, and Constantinople became the centre of what\r\nseemed a second Empire in the East (A.D. 324). Particularly after the\r\ndivision of the Empire between Arcadius and Honorius in 395 does this\r\nbifurcation appear to be marked; and one naturally speaks of the two\r\nEmpires of the West and the East. Yet it cannot be too much emphasized\r\nthat in reality such language is utterly inexact. The Roman empire was,\r\nand always continued to be, ideally one and indivisible. There were two\r\nemperors, but one Empire--two persons, but one power. The point is of\r\ngreat importance for the understanding of the whole of the middle ages:\r\nthere only is, and can be, one Empire, which may indeed, for\r\nconvenience, be ruled conjointly by two emperors, resident, again for\r\nconvenience, in two separate capitals. And, as a matter of fact, not\r\nonly did the residence of an emperor in the East not spell bifurcation,\r\nit actually fostered the tendency towards unification. It helped forward\r\nthe transformation of the Empire into an absolute and quasi-Asiatic\r\nmonarchy, under which all its subjects fell into a single level of loyal\r\nsubmission: it helped to give the emperor a gorgeous court, marked by\r\nall the ceremony and the servility of the East.[1] The deification of\r\nthe emperor himself dates from the days of Augustus; by the time of\r\nConstantine it has infected the court and the government. Each emperor,\r\nagain, had from the first enjoyed the sacrosanct position which was\r\nattached to the tribunate; but now his palace, his chamber, his\r\ncharities, his letters, are all \"sacred,\" and one might almost speak in\r\nadvance of a \"Holy Roman Empire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Influence of Christianity.\r\n\r\nBut there is one factor, the greatest of all, which still remains to be\r\nadded, before we have counted the sum of the forces that made the world\r\nthink in terms of empire for centuries to come; and that is the\r\nreception of Christianity into the Roman empire by Constantine. That\r\nreception added a new sanction to the existence of the Empire and the\r\nposition of the emperor. The Empire, already one and indivisible in its\r\naspect of a political society, was welded still more firmly together\r\nwhen it was informed and permeated by a common Christianity, and unified\r\nby the force of a spiritual bond. The Empire was now the Church; it was\r\nnow indeed indestructible, for, if it perished as an empire, it would\r\nlive as a church. But the Church made it certain that it would not\r\nperish, even as an empire, for many centuries to come. On the one hand\r\nthe Church thought in terms of empire and taught the millions of its\r\ndisciples (including the barbarians themselves) to think in the same\r\nterms. No other political conception--no conception of a [Greek: polis]\r\nor of a nation--was any longer possible. When the Church gained its hold\r\nof the Roman world, the Empire, as it has been well said, was already\r\n\"not only a government, but a fashion of conceiving the world\": it had\r\nstood for three centuries, and no man could think of any other form of\r\npolitical association. Moreover, the gospel of St Paul--that there is\r\n_one_ Church, whereof Christ is the Head, and we are all members--could\r\nnot but reinforce for the Christian the conception of a necessary\r\npolitical unity of all the world under a single head. _Una Chiesa in uno\r\nStato_--such, then, was the theory of the Church. But not only did the\r\nChurch perpetuate the conception of empire by making it a part of its\r\nown theory of the world: it perpetuated that conception equally by\r\nmaterializing it in its own organization of itself. Growing up under the\r\nshadow of the Empire, the Church too became an empire, as the Empire had\r\nbecome a church. As it took over something of the old pagan ceremonial,\r\nso it took over much of the old secular organization. The pope borrowed\r\nhis title of _pontifex maximus_ from the emperor: what is far more, he\r\nmade himself gradually, and in the course of centuries, the Caesar and\r\nImperator of the Church. The offices and the dioceses of the Church are\r\nparallel to the offices and dioceses of the Diocletian empire: the whole\r\nspirit of orderly hierarchy and regular organization, which breathes in\r\nthe Roman Church, is the heritage of ancient Rome. The Donation of\r\nConstantine is a forgery; but it expresses a great truth when it\r\nrepresents Constantine as giving to the pope the imperial palace and\r\ninsignia, and to the clergy the ornaments of the imperial army (see\r\nDONATION OF CONSTANTINE).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Barbarian invasions.\r\n\r\nUpon this world, informed by these ideas, there finally descended, in\r\nthe 5th century, the avalanche of barbaric invasion. Its impact seemed\r\nto split the Empire into fragmentary kingdoms; yet it left the universal\r\nChurch intact, and with it the conception of empire. With that\r\nconception, indeed, the barbarians had already been for centuries\r\nfamiliar: service in Roman armies, and settlement in Roman territories,\r\nhad made the Roman empire for them, as much as for the civilized\r\nprovincial, part of the order of the world. One of the barbarian\r\ninvaders, Odoacer (Odovakar), might seem, in 476, to have swept away the\r\nEmpire from the West, when he commanded the abdication of Romulus\r\nAugustulus; and the date 476 has indeed been generally emphasized as\r\nmarking \"the fall of the Western empire.\" Other invaders, again, men\r\nlike the Frank Clovis or the great Ostrogoth Theodoric, might seem, in\r\nsucceeding years, to have completed the work of Odoacer, and to have\r\nshattered the sorry scheme of the later Empire, by remoulding it into\r\nnational kingdoms. _De facto_, there is some truth in such a view: _de\r\njure_, there is none.[2] All that Odoacer did was to abolish one of the\r\ntwo joint rulers of the indivisible Empire, and to make the remaining\r\nruler at Constantinople sole emperor from the Bosporus to the pillars of\r\nHercules. He abolished the dual sovereignty which had been inaugurated\r\nby Diocletian, and returned to the unity of the Empire in the days of\r\nMarcus Aurelius. He did not abolish the Roman empire in the West: he\r\nonly abolished its separate ruler, and, leaving the Empire itself\r\nsubsisting, under the sway (nominal, it is true, but none the less\r\nacknowledged) of the emperor resident at Constantinople, he claimed to\r\nact as his vicar, under the name of patrician, in the administration of\r\nthe Italian provinces.[3] As Odoacer thus fitted himself into the scheme\r\nof empire, so did both Clovis and Theodoric. They do not claim to be\r\nemperors (that was reserved for Charlemagne): they claim to be the\r\nvicars and lieutenants of the Empire. Theodoric spoke of himself to Zeno\r\nas _imperio vestro famulans_; he left justice and administration in\r\nRoman hands, and maintained two annual consuls in Rome. Clovis received\r\nthe title of consul from Anastasius; the Visigothic kings of Spain (like\r\nthe kings of the savage Lombards) styled themselves Flavii, and\r\npermitted the cities of their eastern coast to send tribute to\r\nConstantinople. Yet it must be admitted that, as a matter of fact, this\r\nadhesion of the new barbaric kings to the Empire was little more than a\r\nform. The Empire maintained its ideal unity by treating them as its\r\nvicars; but they themselves were forming separate and independent\r\nkingdoms within its borders. The Italy of the Ostrogoths cannot have\r\nbelonged, in any real sense, to the Empire; otherwise Justinian would\r\nnever have needed to attempt its reconquest. And in the 7th and 8th\r\ncenturies the form of adhesion itself decayed: the emperor was retiring\r\nupon the Greek world of the East, and the German conquerors, settled\r\nwithin their kingdoms, lost the width of outlook of their old migratory\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Church and the Empire.\r\n\r\n  Growing divergence between East and West.\r\n\r\n  The popes.\r\n\r\nIt is here that the action of the Church becomes of supreme importance.\r\nThe Church had not ceased to believe in the continuous life of the\r\nEmpire. The Fathers had taught that when the cycle of empires was\r\nfinally ended by the disappearance of the empire of Rome, the days of\r\nAntichrist would dawn; and, since Antichrist was not yet come, the\r\nChurch believed that the Empire still lived, and would continue to live\r\ntill his coming. Meanwhile the Eastern emperor, ever since Justinian's\r\nreconquest of Italy, had been able to maintain his hold on the centre of\r\nItaly; and Rome itself, the seat of the head of the Church, still ranked\r\nas one of the cities under his sway. The imperialist theory of the\r\nChurch found its satisfaction in this connexion of its head with\r\nConstantinople; and as long as this connexion continued to satisfy the\r\nChurch, there was little prospect of any change. For many years after\r\ntheir invasion of 568, the pressure which the Lombards maintained on\r\ncentral Italy, from their kingdom in the valley of the Po, kept the\r\npopes steadily faithful to the emperor of the East and his\r\nrepresentative in Italy, the exarch of Ravenna. But it was not in the\r\nnature of things that such fidelity should continue unimpaired. The\r\ndevelopment of the East and the West could not but proceed along\r\nconstantly diverging lines, until the point was reached when their\r\nconnexion must snap. On the one hand, the development of the West set\r\ntowards the increase of the powers of the bishop of Rome until he\r\nreached a height at which subjection to the emperor at Constantinople\r\nbecame impossible. Residence in Rome, the old seat of empire, had in\r\nitself given him a great prestige; and to this prestige St Gregory (pope\r\nfrom 590 to 604) had added in a number of ways. He was one of the\r\nFathers of the Church, and turned its theology into the channels in\r\nwhich it was to flow for centuries; he had acquired for his church the\r\ngreat spiritual colony of England by the mission of St Augustine; he had\r\nbeen the protector of Italy against the Lombards. As the popes thus\r\nbecame more and more spiritual emperors of the West, they found\r\nthemselves less and less able to remain the subjects of the lay emperor\r\nof the East. Meanwhile the emperors of the East were led to interfere in\r\necclesiastical affairs in a manner which the popes and the Western\r\nChurch refused to tolerate. Brought into contact with the pure\r\nmonotheism of Mahommedanism, Leo the Isaurian (718-741) was stimulated\r\ninto a crusade against image-worship, in order to remove from the\r\nChristian Church the charge of idolatry. The West clung to its images:\r\nthe popes revolted against his decrees; and the breach rapidly became\r\nirreparable. As the hold of the Eastern emperor on central Italy began\r\nto be shaken, the popes may have begun to cherish the hope of becoming\r\ntheir successors and of founding a temporal dominion; and that hope can\r\nonly have contributed to the final dissolution of their connexion with\r\nthe Eastern empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Coronation of Charlemagne as emperor of the West.\r\n\r\nThus, in the course of the 8th century, the Empire, _as represented by\r\nthe emperors at Constantinople_, had begun to fade utterly out of the\r\nWest. It had been forgotten by lay sovereigns; it was being abandoned by\r\nthe pope, who had been its chosen apostle. But it did not follow that,\r\nbecause the Eastern emperor ceased to be the representative of the\r\nEmpire for the West, the conception of Empire itself therefore perished.\r\nThe popes only abandoned the representative; they did not abandon the\r\nconception. If they had abandoned the conception, they would have\r\nabandoned the idea that there was an order of the world; they would have\r\ncommitted themselves to a belief in the coming of Antichrist. The\r\nconception of the world as a single Empire-Church remained: what had to\r\nbe discovered was a new representative of one of the two sides of that\r\nconception. For a brief time, it would seem, the pope himself cherished\r\nthe idea of becoming, in his own person, the successor of the ancient\r\nCaesars in their own old capital. By the aid of the Frankish kings, he\r\nhad been able to stop the Lombards from acquiring the succession to the\r\nderelict territories of the Eastern emperor in Italy (from which their\r\nlast exarch had fled overseas in 752), and he had become the temporal\r\nsovereign of those territories. Successor to the Eastern emperor in\r\ncentral Italy, why should he not also become his successor as\r\nrepresentative of the Empire--all the more, since he was the head of the\r\nChurch, which was coextensive with the Empire? Some such hope seems to\r\ninspire the Donation of Constantine, a document forged between 754 and\r\n774, in which Constantine is represented as having conferred on\r\nSilvester I. the imperial palace and insignia, and therewith _omnes\r\nItaliae seu occidentalium regionum provincias loca et civitates_. But\r\nthe hope, if it ever was cherished, proved to be futile. The popes had\r\nnot the material force at their command which would have made them\r\nadequate to the position. The strong arm of the Frankish kings had alone\r\ndelivered them from the Lombards: the same strong arm, they found, was\r\nneeded to deliver them from the wild nobility of their own city. So they\r\nturned to the power which was strong enough to undertake the task which\r\nthey could not themselves attempt, and they invited the Frankish king to\r\nbecome the representative of the imperial conception they cherished.[4]\r\nIn the year 800 central Italy ceased to date its documents by the regnal\r\nyears of the Eastern emperors; for Charlemagne was crowned emperor in\r\ntheir stead.\r\n\r\nThe king of the Franks was well fitted for the position which he was\r\nchosen to fill. He was king of a stock which had been from the first\r\nAthanasian, and had never been tainted, like most of the Germanic\r\ntribes, by the adoption of Arian tenets. His grandfather, Charles\r\nMartel, had saved Europe from the danger of a Mahommedan conquest by his\r\nvictory at Poitiers (732); his father, Pippin the Short, had helped the\r\nEnglish missionary Boniface to achieve the conversion of Germany. The\r\npopes themselves had turned to the Frankish kings for support again and\r\nagain in the course of the 8th century. Gregory III., involved in bitter\r\nhostilities with the iconoclastic reformers of the East, appealed to\r\nCharles Martel for aid, and even offered the king, it is said, the\r\ntitles of consul and patrician. Zacharias pronounced the deposition of\r\nthe last of the Merovingians, and gave to Pippin the title of king\r\n(751); while his successor, Stephen II., hard pressed by the Lombards,\r\nwho were eager to replace the Eastern emperors in the possession of\r\ncentral Italy, not only asked and received the aid of the new king, but\r\nalso acquired, in virtue of Pippin's donation (754), the disputed\r\nexarchate itself. Thus was laid the foundation of the States of the\r\nChurch; and the grateful pope rewarded the donation by the gift of the\r\ntitle of _patricius Romanorum_, which conferred on its recipient the\r\nduty and the privilege of protecting the Roman Church, along with some\r\nundefined measure of authority in Rome itself.[5] Finally, in 773, Pope\r\nAdrian I. had to appeal to Charles, the successor of Pippin, against the\r\naggressions of the last of the Lombard kings; and in 774 Charles\r\nconquered the Lombard kingdom, and himself assumed its iron crown. Thus\r\nby the end of the 8th century the Frankish king stood on the very steps\r\nof the imperial throne. He ruled a realm which extended from the\r\nPyrenees to the Harz, and from Hamburg to Rome--a realm which might be\r\nregarded as in itself a _de facto_ empire. He bore the title of\r\n_patricius_, and he had shown that he did not bear it in vain by his\r\nvigorous defence of the papacy in 774. Here there stood, ready to hand,\r\na natural representative of the conception of Empire; and Leo III.,\r\nfinding that he needed the aid of Charlemagne to maintain himself\r\nagainst his own Romans, finally took the decisive step of crowning him\r\nemperor, as he knelt in prayer at St Peter's, on Christmas Day, 800.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Theory of the Carolingian empire.\r\n\r\nThe coronation of Charlemagne in 800 marks the coalescence into a single\r\nunity of two facts, or rather, more strictly speaking, of a fact and a\r\ntheory. The fact is German and secular: it is the wide _de facto_\r\nempire, which the Frankish sword had conquered, and Frankish policy had\r\norganized as a single whole. The theory is Latin and ecclesiastical: it\r\nis a theory of the necessary political unity of the world, and its\r\nnecessary representation in the person of an emperor--a theory half\r\nspringing from the unity of the old Roman empire, and half derived from\r\nthe unity of the Christian Church as conceived in the New Testament. If\r\nwe seek for the force which caused this fact and this theory to coalesce\r\nin the Carolingian empire, we can only answer--the papacy. The idea of\r\nEmpire was in the Church; and the head of the Church translated this\r\nidea into fact. If, however, we seek to conceive the event of 800 from a\r\npolitical or legal point of view, and to determine the residence of the\r\nright of constituting an emperor, we at once drift into the fogs of\r\ncenturies of controversy. Three answers are possible from three points\r\nof view; and all have their truth, according to the point of view. From\r\nthe ecclesiastical point of view, the right resides with the pope. This\r\ntheory was not promulgated (indeed no theory was promulgated) until the\r\nstruggles of Papacy and Empire in the course of the middle ages; but by\r\nthe time of Innocent III. it is becoming an established doctrine that a\r\n_translatio Imperii_ took place in 800, whereby the pope transferred the\r\nRoman empire from the Greeks to the Germans in the person of the\r\nmagnificent Charles.[6] One can only say that, as a matter of fact, the\r\npopes ceased to recognize the Eastern emperors, and recognized Charles\r\ninstead, in the year 800; that, again, this recognition alone made\r\nCharles emperor, as nothing else could have done; but that no question\r\narose, at the time, of any right of the pope to give the Empire to\r\nCharlemagne, for the simple reason that neither of the actors was acting\r\nor thinking in a legal spirit. If we now turn to study the point of view\r\nof the civil lawyer, animated by such a spirit, and basing himself on\r\nthe code of Justinian, we shall find that an emperor must derive his\r\ninstitution and power from a _lex regia_ passed by the _populus\r\nRomanus_; and such a view, strictly interpreted, will lead us to the\r\nconclusion that the citizens of Rome had given the crown to Charlemagne\r\nin 800, and continued to bestow it on successive emperors afterwards.\r\nThere is indeed some speech, in the contemporary accounts of\r\nCharlemagne's coronation, of the presence of \"ancients among the Romans\"\r\nand of \"the faithful people\"; but they are merely present to witness or\r\napplaud, and the conception of the Roman people as the source of Empire\r\nis one that was only championed, at a far later date, by antiquarian\r\nidealists like Arnold of Brescia and Cola di Rienzi. The _faex Romuli_,\r\na population of lodging-house keepers, living upon pilgrims to the papal\r\ncourt, could hardly be conceived, except by an ardent imagination, as\r\nheir to the _Quirites_ of the past. Finally, from the point of view of\r\nthe German tribesman, we must admit that the Empire was something which,\r\nonce received by his king (no matter how), descended in the royal family\r\nas an heirloom; or to which (when the kingship became elective) a title\r\nwas conferred, along with the kingship, by the vote of electors.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Relations of the Carolingian to the Eastern empire.\r\n\r\nBut apart from these questions of origin, two difficulties have still to\r\nbe faced with regard to the nature and position of the Carolingian\r\nempire. Did Charlemagne and his successors enter into a new relation\r\nwith their subjects, in virtue of their coronation? And what was the\r\nnature of the relation between the new emperor now established in the\r\nWest and the old emperor still reigning in the East? It is true that\r\nCharlemagne exacted a new oath of allegiance from his subjects after his\r\ncoronation, and again that he had a revision of all the laws of his\r\ndominions made in 802. But the revision did not amount to much in bulk:\r\nwhat there was contained little that was Roman; and, on the whole, it\r\nhardly seems probable that Charlemagne entered into any new relation\r\nwith his subjects. The relation of his empire to the empire in the East\r\nis a more difficult and important problem. In 797 the empress Irene had\r\ndeposed and blinded her son, Constantine VI., and usurped his throne.\r\nNow it would seem that Charlemagne, whose thoughts were already set on\r\nEmpire, hoped to depose and succeed Irene, and thus to become sole\r\nrepresentative of the conception of Empire, both for the East and for\r\nthe West. Suddenly there came, in 800, his own coronation as emperor, an\r\nact apparently unpremeditated at the moment, taking him by surprise, as\r\none gathers from Einhard's _Vita Karoli_, and interrupting his plans. It\r\nleft him representative of the Empire for the West only, confronting\r\nanother representative in the East. Such a position he did not desire:\r\nthere had been a single Empire vested in a single person since 476, and\r\nhe desired that there should still continue to be a single Empire,\r\nvested only in his own person. He now sought to achieve this unity by a\r\nproposal of marriage to Irene. The proposal failed, and he had to\r\ncontent himself with a recognition of his imperial title by the two\r\nsuccessors of the empress. This did not, however, mean (at any rate in\r\nthe issue) that henceforth there were to be two conjoint rulers,\r\namicably ruling as colleagues a single Empire, in the manner of Arcadius\r\nand Honorius. The dual government of a single Empire established by\r\nDiocletian had finally vanished in 476; and the unity of the Empire was\r\nnow conceived, as it had been conceived before the days of Diocletian,\r\nto demand a single representative. Henceforth there were two rulers, one\r\nat Aix-la-Chapelle and one at Constantinople, each claiming, whatever\r\ntemporary concessions he might make, to be the sole ruler and\r\nrepresentative of the Roman empire. On the one hand, the Western\r\nemperors held that, upon the deposition of Constantine VI., Charlemagne\r\nhad succeeded him, after a slight interval, in the government of the\r\nwhole Empire, both in the East and in the West; on the other hand, the\r\nEastern emperors, in spite of their grudging recognition of Charlemagne\r\nat the moment, regarded themselves as the only lawful successors of\r\nConstantine VI., and viewed the Carolings and their later successors as\r\nupstarts and usurpers, with no right to their imperial pretensions.\r\nHenceforth two halves confronted one another, each claiming to be the\r\nwhole; two finite bodies touched, and each yet claimed to be infinite.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Character of the Carolingian empire.\r\n\r\n  Break-up of the Carolingian empire.\r\n\r\n  Attitude of the papacy.\r\n\r\nIf, as has been suggested, Charlemagne did not enter into any\r\nfundamentally new relations with his subjects after his coronation, it\r\nfollows that the results of his coronation, in the sphere of policy and\r\nadministration, cannot have been considerable. The Empire added a new\r\nsanction to a policy and administration already developed. Charlemagne\r\nhad already showed himself _episcopus episcoporum_, anxious not only to\r\nsuppress heresy and supervise the clergy within his borders, but also to\r\nextend true Christianity without them even before the year when his\r\nimperial coronation gave him a new title to supreme governorship in all\r\ncases ecclesiastical. He had already organized his empire on a new\r\nuniform system of counties, and the _missi dominici_ were already at\r\nwork to superintend the action of the counts, even before the _renovatio\r\nimperii Romani_ came to suggest such uniformity and centralization.\r\nCharlemagne had a new title; but his subjects still obeyed the king of\r\nthe Franks, and lived by Frankish law, in the old fashion. In their\r\neyes, and in the eyes of Charlemagne's own descendants, the Empire was\r\nsomething appendant to the kingship of the Franks, which made that\r\nkingship unique among others, but did not radically alter its character.\r\nTrue, the kingship might be divided among brothers by the old Germanic\r\ncustom of partition, while the Empire must inhere in one person; but\r\nthat was the one difference, and the one difficulty, which might easily\r\nbe solved by attaching the name of emperor to the eldest brother. Such\r\nwas the conception of the Carolings: such was not, however, the\r\nconception of the Church. To the popes the Empire was a solemn office,\r\nto which the kings of the Franks might most naturally be called, in view\r\nof their power and the traditions of their house, but which by no means\r\nremained in their hands as a personal property. By thus seeking to\r\ndissociate the Empire from any indissoluble connexion with the\r\nCarolingian house, the popes were able to save it. Civil wars raged\r\namong the descendants of Charlemagne: partitions recurred: the Empire\r\nwas finally dissolved, in the sense that the old realm of Charlemagne\r\nfell asunder, in 888. But the Empire, as an office, did not perish.\r\nDuring the 9th century the popes had insisted, as each emperor died,\r\nthat the new emperor needed coronation at their hands; and they had thus\r\nkept alive the conception of the Empire as an office to which they\r\ninvited, if they did not appoint, each successive emperor. The quarrels\r\nof the Carolingian house helped them to make good their claim. John\r\nVIII. was able to select Charles the Bald in preference to other\r\nclaimants in 875; and before the end of his pontificate he could write\r\nthat \"he who is to be ordained by us to the Empire must be by us first\r\nand foremost invited and elected.\" Thus was the unity of the Empire\r\npreserved, and the conception of a united Empire continued, in spite of\r\nthe eventual dissolution of the realm of Charlemagne. When the\r\nCarolingian emperors disappeared, Benedict IV. could crown Louis of\r\nProvence (901) and John X. could invite to the vacant throne an Italian\r\npotentate like Berengar of Friuli (915); and even when Berengar died in\r\n924, and the Empire was vacant of an emperor, they could hold, and hold\r\nwith truth, that the Empire was not dead, but only suspended, until such\r\ntime as they should invite a new ruler to assume the office.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The German kingdom and the empire.\r\n\r\n  The Holy Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nVarious causes had contributed to the dissolution of the realm of\r\nCharlemagne. Partitions had split it; feudalism had begun to honeycomb\r\nit; incessant wars had destroyed its core, the fighting Franks of\r\nAustrasia. But, above all, the rise of divisions within the realm,\r\nwhich, whether animated by the spirit of nationality or no, were\r\nultimately destined to develop into nations, had silently undermined the\r\nstructure of Pippin and Charlemagne. Already in 842 the oath of\r\nStrassburg shows us one Caroling king swearing in French and another in\r\nGerman: already in 870 the partition of Mersen shows us the kings of\r\nFrance and Germany dividing the middle kingdom which lay between the two\r\ncountries by the linguistic frontier of the Meuse and Moselle. The year\r\n888 is the birth-year of modern Europe. France, Germany, Italy, stood\r\ndistinct as three separate units, with Burgundy and Lorraine as\r\ndebatable lands, as they were destined to remain for centuries to come.\r\nIf the conception of Empire was still to survive, the pope must\r\nultimately invite the ruler of the strongest of these three units to\r\nassume the imperial crown; and this was what happened when in 962 Pope\r\nJohn XII. invited Otto I. of Germany to renew once more the Roman\r\nEmpire. As the imperial strength of the whole Frankish tribe had given\r\nthem the Empire in 800, so did the national strength of the East\r\nFrankish kingdom, now resting indeed on a Saxon rather than a Frankish\r\nbasis, bring the Empire to its ruler in 962. The centre of political\r\ngravity had already been shifting to the east of the Rhine in the course\r\nof the 9th century. While the Northmen had carried their arms along the\r\nrivers and into the heart of France, Louis the German had consolidated\r\nhis kingdom in a long reign of sixty years (817-876); and at the end of\r\nthe 9th century two kings of Germany had already worn the imperial\r\ncrown. Early in the 10th century the kingship of Germany had come to the\r\nvigorous Saxon dukes (919); and strong in their Saxon basis Henry I. and\r\nhis son Otto had built a realm which, disunited as it was, was far more\r\ncompact than that which the Carolings of the West ruled from Laon. Henry\r\nI. had thought in his later years of going to Rome for the imperial\r\ncrown: under Otto I. the imperial idea becomes manifest. On the one\r\nhand, he established a semi-imperial position in the West: by 946 Louis\r\nIV. d'Outremer is his protege, and it is his arms which maintain the\r\nyoung Conrad of Burgundy on his throne. On the other hand, he showed, by\r\nhis policy towards the German Church, that he was the true heir of the\r\nCarolingian traditions. He made churchmen his ministers; he established\r\nmissionary bishoprics on the Elbe which should spread Christianity among\r\nthe Wends; and his dearest project was a new archbishopric of Magdeburg.\r\nThe one thing needful was that he should, like Charlemagne, acquire the\r\nthrone of Italy; and the dissolute condition of that country during the\r\nfirst half of the 10th century made its acquisition not only possible,\r\nbut almost imperative. Begun in 952, the acquisition was completed ten\r\nyears later; and all the conditions were now present for Otto's\r\nassumption of the imperial throne. He was crowned by John XII. on\r\nCandlemas Day 962, and thus was begun the Holy Roman Empire, which\r\nlasted henceforth with a continuous life until 1806.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Empire and feudalism.\r\n\r\nThe same ideas underlay the new empire which had underlain that of\r\nCharlemagne, strengthened and reinforced by the fact that they had\r\nalready found a visible expression before in that earlier empire.\r\nHistorically, there was the tradition of the old Roman empire, preserved\r\nby the Church as an idea, and preserved in the Church, and its imperial\r\norganization, as an actual fact. Ecclesiastically, there was the Pauline\r\nconception of a single Christian Church, one in subjection to Christ as\r\nits Head, and needing (so men still thought) a secular counterpart of\r\nits indivisible unity.[9] To these two sanctions philosophy later added\r\na third; and the doctrine of Realism, that the one universal is the true\r\nabiding substance--the doctrine which pervades the _De monarchia_ of\r\nDante,--reinforced the feeling which demanded that Europe should be\r\nconceived as a single political unity. But if the Holy Roman empire of\r\nthe German nation has the old foundations, it is none the less a thing\r\n_sui generis_. Externally, it meant far less than the empire of\r\nCharlemagne; it meant simply a union of Germany and northern Italy (to\r\nwhich, after 1032, one must also add Burgundy, though the addition is in\r\nreality nominal) under a single rule. Historians of the 19th century,\r\nduring the years in which the modern German empire was in travail,\r\ndisputed sorely on the advantages of this union; but whatever its\r\nadvantages or disadvantages, the fact remains that the union of Teutonic\r\nGermany and Latin Italy was, from an external point of view, the\r\nessential fact in the structure of the medieval Empire. Internally,\r\nagain, the Empire of the Ottos and their successors was new and\r\nunprecedented. If Latin imperialism had been combined with Frankish\r\ntribalism in the Empire of Charlemagne, it now met and blended with\r\nfeudalism. The Holy Roman emperor of the middle ages, as Frederick I.\r\nproudly told the Roman envoys, found his senate in the diet of the\r\nGerman baronage, his _equites_ in the ranks of the German knights.\r\nFeudalism, indeed, came in time to invade the very conception of Empire\r\nitself. The emperors began to believe that their position of emperor\r\nmade them feudal overlords of other kings and princes; and they came to\r\nbe regarded as the topmost summit of the feudal pyramid, from whom kings\r\nheld their kingdoms, while they themselves held directly of God. In this\r\nway the old conception of the world as a single political society\r\nentered upon a new phase: but the translation of that conception into\r\nfeudal terms, which might have made Diocletian gasp, only gave it the\r\ngreater hold on the feudal society of the middle ages. Yet in one way\r\nthe feudal conception was a source of weakness to the Empire; for the\r\npopes, from the middle of the 12th century onwards, began to claim for\r\nthemselves a feudal overlordship of the world, and to regard the emperor\r\nas the chief of their vassals. The theory of the _Translatio_ buttressed\r\ntheir claim to be overlords of the Empire; and the emperors found that\r\ntheir very duty to defend the Papacy turned them into its vassals--for\r\nwas not the _advocatus_ who defended the lands of an abbey or church its\r\ntenant by feudal service, and might not analogy extend the feudal\r\nrelation to the imperial advocate himself?\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Empire and the Papacy.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the Empire to the Papacy is indeed the cardinal fact in\r\nits history for the three centuries which followed the coronation of\r\nOtto I. (962-1250). For a century (962-1076) the relation was one of\r\namity. The pope and the emperor stood as co-ordinate sovereigns, ruling\r\ntogether the commonwealth of Europe.[10] If either stood before the\r\nother, the emperor stood before the pope. The Romans had sworn to Otto\r\nI. that they would never elect or ordain a pope without his consent; and\r\nthe rights over papal elections conceived to belong to the office of\r\n_patricius_, which they generally held, enabled the emperors, upon\r\noccasion, to nominate the pope of their choice. The partnership of Otto\r\nIII., son of a Byzantine princess, and his nominee Silvester II.\r\n(already distinguished as Gerbert, _scholasticus_ of the chapter school\r\nof Reims) forms a remarkable page in the annals of Empire and Papacy.\r\nOtto, once the pupil of Silvester in classical studies, and taught by\r\nhis mother the traditions of the Byzantine empire, dreamed of renewing\r\nthe Empire of Constantine, with Rome itself for its centre; and this\r\nantiquarian idealism (which Arnold of Brescia and Cola di Rienzi were\r\nafterwards, though with some difference of aim, to share) was encouraged\r\nin his pupil by the pope. Tradition afterwards ascribed to the two the\r\nfirst project of a crusade, and the institution of the seven electors:\r\nin truth their faces were turned to the past rather than to the future,\r\nand they sought not to create, but to renovate. The dream of restoring\r\nthe age of Constantine passed with the premature death of Otto; and\r\nafter the death of Silvester II. the papacy was degraded into an\r\nappendage of the Tusculan family. From that degradation the Church was\r\nrescued by Henry III. (the second emperor of the new Salian house, which\r\nreigned from 1024 to 1125), when in 1046 he caused the deposition of\r\nthree competing popes, and afterwards filled the papal chair with his\r\nown nominees; but it was rescued more effectually by itself, when in\r\n1059 the celebrated bull _In nomine Domini_ of Nicholas II. reserved the\r\nright of electing the popes to the college of cardinals (see CONCLAVE).\r\nA new era of the Papacy begins with the decree, and that era found its\r\nexponent in Hildebrand. If under Henry III. the Empire stands in many\r\nrespects at its zenith, and the emperor nominates to the Papacy, it\r\nsinks, under Henry IV., almost to the nadir of its fortunes, and a pope\r\nattempts, with no little success, to fight and defeat an emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Investiture contest.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the Papacy, which the action of Henry III. in 1046 had\r\nhelped to begin, and the bull of 1059 had greatly promoted, was\r\nultimately due to an ecclesiastical revival, which goes by the name of\r\nthe Cluniac movement. The aim of that movement was to separate the\r\nChurch from the world, and thus to make it independent of the laity and\r\nthe lay power; and it sought to realize its aim first by the prohibition\r\nof clerical marriage and simony, and ultimately by the prohibition of\r\nlay investiture. A decree of Gregory VII. in 1075 forbade emperor, king\r\nor prince to \"presume to give investiture of bishoprics,\" under pain of\r\nexcommunication; and Henry IV., contravening the decree, fell under the\r\npenalty, and the War of Investitures began (1076-1122). Whether or no\r\nHenry humiliated himself at Canossa (and the opinion of German\r\nhistorians now inclines to regard the traditional account as\r\nexaggerated) the Empire certainly suffered in his reign a great loss of\r\nprestige. The emperor lost his hold over Germany, where the aid of the\r\npope strengthened the hands of the discontented nobility: he lost his\r\nhold over Italy, where the Lombard towns gradually acquired municipal\r\nindependence, and the donation of the Countess Matilda gave the popes\r\nthe germ of a new and stronger _dominium temporale_. The First Crusade\r\ncame, and the emperor, its natural leader, could not lead it; while the\r\ncentre of learning and civilization, in the course of the fifty years'\r\nWar of Investitures, gradually shifted to France. The struggle was\r\nfinally ended by a compromise--the Concordat of Worms--in 1122; but the\r\nPapacy, which had fought the long War of Investitures and inspired the\r\nFirst Crusade, was a far greater power than it had been at the beginning\r\nof the struggle, and the emperor, shaken in his hold on Germany and\r\nItaly, had lost both power and prestige (see INVESTITURE). It is\r\nsignificant that a theory of the feudal subjection of the emperor to the\r\npope, foreshadowed in the pontificate of Innocent II., and definitely\r\nenounced by the envoys of Adrian IV. at the diet of Besancon in 1157,\r\nnow begins to arise. The popes, who had called the emperors to be heads\r\nof the European commonwealth in 800 and again in 962, begin to vindicate\r\nthat headship for themselves. Gregory VII. had already claimed that the\r\npope stood to the emperor, as the sun to the moon; and gradually the old\r\nco-ordination disappeared in a new subordination of the Empire to the\r\npapal _plenitudo potestatis_. The claim of ecclesiastical independence\r\nof the middle of the 11th century was rapidly becoming a claim of\r\necclesiastical supremacy in the middle of the 12th: the imperial claim\r\nto nominate popes, which had lasted till 1059, was turning into the\r\npapal claim to nominate emperors. Yet at this very time a new period of\r\nsplendour dawned for the Empire; and the rule of the three Hohenstaufen\r\nemperors, Frederick I., Henry VI. and Frederick II. (1152-1250), marks\r\nthe period of its history which attracts most sympathy and admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Hohenstaufen emperors.\r\n\r\n  Overthrow of the Empire in Italy.\r\n\r\nFrederick I. regained a new strength in Germany, partly because he\r\nunited in his veins the blood of the two great contending families, the\r\nWelfs and the Waiblingens; partly because he had acquired large\r\npatrimonial possessions in Swabia, which took the place of the last\r\nSaxon demesne; partly because he had a greater control over the German\r\nepiscopate than his predecessors had enjoyed for many years past. At the\r\nsame time the revival of interest in the study of Roman law gave the\r\nemperor, as source and centre of that law, a new dignity and prestige,\r\nparticularly in Italy, the home and hearth of the revival. Confident in\r\nthis new strength, he attempted to vindicate his claims on Italy, and\r\nsought, by uniting the two under his sway, to inspire with new life the\r\nold Ottonian Empire. He failed to crush Lombard municipal independence:\r\ndefeated at Legnano in 1176, he had to recognize his defeat at the\r\ntreaty of Constance in 1183. He failed to acquire control over the\r\nPapacy: a new struggle of Empire and Papacy, begun in the pontificate of\r\nAdrian IV. on the question of control over Rome, and continued in the\r\npontificate of Alexander III., because Frederick recognized an\r\nanti-pope, ended in the emperor's recognition of his defeat at Venice in\r\n1177. The one success was the acquisition of the Norman kingdom for\r\nHenry VI., who was married to its heiress, Constance. But the one\r\nsuccess of Frederick's Italian policy proved the ruin of his house in\r\nthe reign of his grandson Frederick II. On the one hand, the possession\r\nof Sicily induced Frederick II. to neglect Germany; and by two\r\ndocuments, one of 1220 and one of 1231, he practically abdicated his\r\nsovereign powers to the German princes in order to conciliate their\r\nsupport for his Italian policy. On the other hand, the possession of\r\nSicily involved him in the third great struggle of Empire and Papacy.\r\nStrong in his Sicilian kingdom in the south, and seeking, like his\r\ngrandfather, to establish his power in Lombardy, Frederick practically\r\naimed at the unification of Italy, a policy which threatened to engulf\r\nthe States of the Church and to reduce the Papacy to impotence. The\r\npopes excommunicated the emperor: they aided the Lombard towns to\r\nmaintain their independence; finally, after Frederick's death (1250),\r\nthey summoned Charles of Anjou into Sicily to exterminate his house. By\r\n1268 he had done his work, and the medieval Empire was practically at an\r\nend. When Rudolph of Habsburg succeeded in 1273, he was only the head of\r\na federation of princes in Germany, while in Italy he abandoned all\r\nclaims over the centre and south, and only retained titular rights in\r\nthe Lombard plain.\r\n\r\nThus ended the first great chapter in the history of the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire which Otto had founded in 962. In those three centuries the great\r\nfact had been its relation to the Papacy: in the last two of those three\r\ncenturies the relation had been one of enmity. The basis of the enmity\r\nhad been the papal claim to supreme headship of Latin Christianity, and\r\nto an independent temporal demesne in Italy as the condition of that\r\nheadship. Because they desired supreme headship, the popes had sought to\r\nreduce the emperor's headship to something lower than, and dependent\r\nupon, their own--to a mere fief held of St Peter: because they desired a\r\ntemporal demesne, they had sought to expel him from Italy, since any\r\nimperial hold on Italy threatened their independence. They had succeeded\r\nin defeating the Empire, but they had also destroyed the Papacy; for the\r\nFrench aid which they had invoked against the Hohenstaufen developed,\r\nwithin fifty years of the fall of that house, into French control, and\r\nthe captivity at Avignon (1308-1378) was the logical result of the final\r\nvictory of Charles of Anjou at Tagliacozzo. The struggle seemed to have\r\nended in nothing but the exhaustion of both combatants. Yet in many\r\nrespects it had in reality made for progress. It had set men thinking of\r\nthe respective limits of church and state, as the many _libelli de lite\r\nimperatorum et pontificum_ show; and from that thought had issued a new\r\nconception of the state, as existing in its own right and supreme in its\r\nown sphere, a conception which is the necessary basis of the modern\r\nnation-state. If it had dislocated Germany into a number of territorial\r\nprincipalities, it had produced a college of electors to represent the\r\ncause of unity: if it had helped to prevent the unification of Italy,\r\nand had left to Italy the fatal legacy of Guelph and Ghibelline feuds,\r\nit had equally helped to produce Italian municipal independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Empire from the election of Rudolph of Habsburg, 1273.\r\n\r\nA new chapter of the history of the Empire fills the three centuries\r\nfrom 1273 to 1556--from the accession of Rudolph of Habsburg to the\r\nabdication of Charles V. Italy was now lost: the Empire had now no\r\npeculiar connexion with Rome, and far less touch with the Papacy. A new\r\nGermany had risen. The extinction of several royal stocks and the\r\nnomination of anti-kings in the course of civil wars had made the\r\nmonarchy elective, and raised to the side of the emperor a college of\r\nelectors (see ELECTORS), which appears as definitely established soon\r\nafter 1250. With Italy lost, and Germany thus transmuted, why should the\r\nEmpire have still continued to exist? In the first place, it continued\r\nto exist because the Germans still found a king necessary and because,\r\nthe German king having been called for three centuries emperor, it\r\nseemed necessary that he should still continue to bear the name. In this\r\nsense the Empire existed as the presidency of a Germanic confederation,\r\nand as something analogous to the modern German empire, with the one\r\ngreat difference that the Hohenzollerns now derive from Prussia a\r\nstrength which enables them to make their imperial position a reality,\r\nwhile no Luxemburg or Habsburg was able to make his imperial position\r\notherwise than honorary and nominal. In the second place, it continued\r\nto exist because the conception of the unity of western Europe still\r\nlingered, and was still conceived to need an exponent. In this sense the\r\nEmpire existed as a presidency, still more honorary and still more\r\nnominal, of the nations of western Europe. In both capacities the\r\nemperor existed to a great extent because he was a legal\r\nnecessity--because, in Germany, he was necessary for the investiture of\r\nprinces with their principalities, and because, in Europe, he was\r\nnecessary, as the source of all rights, to bestow crowns upon would-be\r\nkings, or to act as the head of the great orders of chivalry, or to give\r\npatents to notaries. With the history of the Empire regarded as a German\r\nconfederation we are not here concerned. The reigns of the Habsburg,\r\nLuxemburg and Wittelsbach emperors belong to the history of Germany.\r\nYet two of these emperors, Henry VII. and Louis IV., should not pass\r\nwithout notice, the one for his own sake, the other for the sake of his\r\nadherents, and both because, by interfering in Italy, and coming into\r\nconflict with the Papacy, they brought once more into prominence the\r\nEuropean aspect of the Empire.\r\n\r\nHenry VII., the contemporary and the hero of Dante, descended into Italy\r\nin 1310, partly because he had no power and no occupation in Germany,\r\npartly because he was deeply imbued with the sense of his imperial\r\ndignity. Coming as a peacemaker and mediator, he was driven by Guelph\r\nopposition into a Ghibelline role; and he came into conflict with\r\nClement V., the first of the Avignonese popes, who under the pressure of\r\nFrance attempted to enforce upon Henry a recognition of his feudal\r\nsubjection. Henry asserted his independence: he claimed Rome for his\r\ncapital, and the lordship of the world for his right; but, just as a\r\nstruggle seemed impending, he died, in 1313. During the reign of his\r\nsuccessor, Louis IV., the struggle came. Louis had been excommunicated\r\nby John XXII. in 1324 for acting as emperor before he had received papal\r\nrecognition. None the less, in 1328, he came to Rome for his coronation.\r\nHe had gathered round him strange allies; on the one hand, the more\r\nadvanced Franciscans, apostles of the cause of clerical disendowment,\r\nand inimical to a wealthy papacy; on the other hand, jurists like\r\nMarsilius of Padua and John of Jandun, who brought to the cause of Louis\r\nthe spirit and the doctrines which had already been used in the struggle\r\nbetween Boniface VIII. and Philip IV. of France. Marsilius in\r\nparticular, in a treatise called the _Defensor Pacis_, insisted on the\r\nmajesty of the lay state, and even on its superiority to the Church.\r\nPerhaps it was Marsilius, learned as he was in Roman law, and\r\nremembering the _lex regia_ by which the Roman people had of old\r\nconferred its power on the emperor, who suggested to Louis the policy,\r\nwhich he followed, of receiving the imperial crown by the decree and at\r\nthe hands of the Roman people. The policy was remarkable: Louis embraced\r\nan alliance which Frederick Barbarossa had spurned, and recognized the\r\nmedieval Romans as the source of imperial power. Not less remarkable was\r\nthe new attitude of the German electors, who for the first time\r\nsupported an emperor against the pope, because they now felt menaced in\r\ntheir own electoral rights; and the one permanent result which finally\r\nflowed from the struggle was the enunciation and definition of the\r\nrights and privileges of the electors in the Golden Bull of 1356 (see\r\nGOLDEN BULL).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Empire and the rise of the idea of national states.\r\n\r\nIn this struggle with the Papacy the Empire had shown something of its\r\nold universal aspect. It had come into connexion with Italy, and into\r\nclose connexion with Rome: it had enlisted in defence of its rights at\r\nonce an Italian like Marsilius and an Englishman like Ockham. The same\r\nuniversal aspect appeared once more in the age of the conciliar\r\nmovement, at the beginning of the 15th century. One of the essential\r\nduties of the emperor, as defender of the Church, was to help the\r\nassembling and the deliberations of general councils of the Church. This\r\nwas the duty discharged by Sigismund, when he forced John XXIII. to\r\nsummon a council at Constance in 1414, and sought, though in vain, to\r\nguide its deliberations. The journey which Sigismund undertook in the\r\ninterests of the council (1415-1417) is particularly noteworthy. He\r\nsought to make peace throughout western Europe, acting as international\r\narbitrator--in virtue of his presidency of western Europe--between\r\nEngland and France, between Burgundians and Armagnacs; but he failed in\r\nhis aim, and when he returned to the council, it was only to witness the\r\ndefeat of the party of reform which he championed. National feeling and\r\nnational antipathies proved too strong for Sigismund's attempt to revive\r\nthe medieval empire for the purposes of international arbitration: the\r\nsame feeling, the same antipathies, made inevitable the failure of the\r\ncouncil itself, in which western Europe had sought to meet once more as\r\na single religious commonwealth. Early in the 15th century, therefore,\r\nthe conception of the unity of western Europe, as a single\r\nEmpire-Church, was already waning in both its aspects. The unity of the\r\nChurch Universal was dissolving, and the conception of the nation-church\r\narising (as the separate concordats granted by Martin V. to the\r\ndifferent nations prove); while the unity of the Empire was proved a\r\ndream, by the powerlessness of the emperor in the face of the struggle\r\nof England and France.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Influence of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nRenaissance and Reformation combined to complete the fall which the\r\nfailure of Sigismund to guide the conciliar movement had already\r\nforeshadowed. The Renaissance, revolting against the medievalism of the\r\n_studium_ and not sparing even the _sacerdotium_ of the middle ages, had\r\nlittle respect for the medieval _imperium_; and, going back to pure\r\nLatin and original Greek, it went back beyond even the classical empire\r\nto find its ideals and inspirations. But it is the coming of the\r\nReformation, and with it of the nation-church, which finally marks the\r\nepoch at which the last vestige of the old conception of the political\r\nunity of the world disappears before the nation-state. Externally indeed\r\nit seemed, at the time of the Reformation, as if the old Empire had been\r\nrevived in the person of Charles V., who owned territories as vast as\r\nthose of Charlemagne. But Charles's dominions were a dynastic\r\nagglomeration, knit together by no vivifying conception; and, though\r\nCharles was a champion of the one Catholic Church against the\r\nReformation, he did not in any way seek to revive the power of the\r\nmedieval empire. Meanwhile the reforming monarchs, while they cast off\r\nthe Roman Church, cast off with it the Roman empire. Henry VIII.\r\ndeclared himself free, not only of the pope, but of all other foreign\r\npower; not only so, but as he sought to take the place of the pope with\r\nregard to his own church, so he sought to take the place of the emperor\r\nwith regard to his kingdom, and spoke of his \"imperial\" crown, a style\r\nwhich recurs in later Tudor reigns.[11] The conception of one Empire\r\npassed out of Europe, or, if it remained, it remained only in an\r\nhonorary precedence accorded by other sovereigns to the king of Germany,\r\nwho still entitled himself emperor. In Germany itself the honorary\r\npresidency which the emperor enjoyed over the princes came to mean still\r\nless than before, when religious differences divided the country, and\r\nthe principle of _cujus regio ejus religio_ accentuated the local\r\nautonomy of the prince. When Charles abdicated in 1556, the change which\r\nthe accession of Rudolph of Habsburg had already marked was complete:\r\nthere was no empire except in Germany, and in Germany the Empire was\r\nnothing more than a convenient legal conception. The Reformation, by\r\nsweeping away the spiritual unity of western Christendom, had swept away\r\nany real conception of its political unity, and with that conception it\r\nhad swept away the Empire; while it had also, by splitting Germany into\r\ntwo religious camps, and making the emperor at the most the head of a\r\nreligious faction, dissipated the last vestiges of a real Empire in the\r\ncountry which had, since 962, been its peculiar home.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Empire as a German confederation.\r\n\r\nFrom 1556 to 1806 the Empire means a loose federation of the different\r\nprinces of Germany, lay and ecclesiastical, under the presidency,\r\nelective in theory but hereditary in practice, of the house of Habsburg.\r\nIt is an empire much in the same sense as the modern German empire, with\r\na diet somewhat analogous to the modern Bundesrat, and a cumbrous\r\nimperial chamber for purposes of justice, hardly at all analogous to the\r\nhighly organized system of federal justice which prevails in Germany\r\nto-day. The dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire into this loose\r\nfederation had already been anticipated by the concessions made to the\r\nprinces by Frederick II. in 1220 and 1231; but the final organization of\r\nGermany on federal lines was only attained in the treaty of Westphalia\r\nof 1648. The attempt of Ferdinand II., in the course of the Thirty\r\nYears' War, to assert a practically monarchical authority over the\r\nprinces of Germany, only led to the regular vindication by the princes\r\nof their own monarchical authority. The emperor, who had tried in the\r\n15th century to be the international authority of all Europe, now sank\r\nto the position of less than inter-state arbitrator in Germany. That the\r\nEmpire and the emperor were retained at all, when the princes became so\r\nmany independent sovereigns, was due partly to a lingering sense of\r\nquasi-national sentiment for a _magni nominis umbra_, partly to the need\r\nof some authority which should combine in one whole principalities of\r\nvery different sizes and strengths, and should protect the weak from the\r\nstrong, and all from France. But this authority only found its _symbol_\r\nin the emperor. Such real federal authority as there was remained with\r\nthe diet, a congress of sovereign princes through their accredited\r\nrepresentatives; and the emperor's sole rights, as emperor, were those\r\nof granting titles and confirming tolls. The Habsburgs, emperors in each\r\nsuccessive generation, never pursued an imperial, but always a dynastic\r\npolicy; and they were perfectly ready to sacrifice to the aggrandizement\r\nof their house the honour of the Empire, as when they ceded Lorraine to\r\nFrance in return for Tuscany (1735).\r\n\r\n\r\n  End of the Holy Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nIt needed the cataclysm of the French Revolution finally to overthrow\r\nthe Empire. Throughout the 18th century it lasted, a thing of\r\nlong-winded protocols and never-ending lawsuits, \"neither Holy, nor\r\nRoman, nor an Empire.\" But with Napoleon came its destroyer. As far back\r\nas the end of the 13th century, French kings had been scheming to annex\r\nthe title or at any rate absorb the territories of the Empire: at the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century the annexation of the title by Napoleon\r\nseemed very imminent. Posing as the New Charlemagne (\"because, like\r\nCharlemagne, I unite the crown of France to that of the Lombards, and my\r\nEmpire marches with the East\"), he resolved in 1806, during the\r\ndissolution and recomposition of Germany which followed the peace of\r\nLuneville, to oust Francis II. from his title, and to make the Holy\r\nRoman Empire part and parcel of the \"Napoleonic idea.\" He was\r\nanticipated, however, by the prompt action of the proud Habsburg, who\r\nwas equally resolved that no other should wear the crown which he\r\nhimself was powerless to defend, and accordingly, on the 6th of August\r\n1806, Francis resigned the imperial dignity. So perished the Empire. Out\r\nof its ashes sprang the Austrian Empire, for Francis, in 1804, partly to\r\ncounter Napoleon's assumption of the title of Emperor of the French,\r\npartly to prepare for the impending dissolution of the old Empire, had\r\nassumed the title of \"Hereditary Emperor of Austria.\" And in yet more\r\nrecent times the German empire may be regarded, in a still more real\r\nsense than Austria, as the descendant and representative of the old\r\nEmpire of the German nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  General influence of the Empire.\r\n\r\nWhat had been the results of the Holy Roman Empire, in the course of its\r\nlong history, upon Germany and upon Europe? It has been a _vexata\r\nquaestio_ among German historians, whether or no the Empire ruined\r\nGermany. Some have argued that it diverted the attention of the German\r\nkings from their own country to Italy, and that, by bringing them into\r\nconflict with the popes, and by thus strengthening the hands of their\r\nrebellious baronage with a papal alliance, it prevented the development\r\nof a national German monarchy, such as other sovereigns of western\r\nEurope were able to found. Others again have emphasized the racial\r\ndivision of Saxon and Frank, of High German and Low German, as the great\r\ncause of the failure of Germany to grow into a united national whole,\r\nand have sought to ascribe to the influence of the Empire such unity as\r\nwas achieved; while they have attributed the learning, the trade, the\r\npre-eminence of medieval Germany to the Italian connexion and the\r\nprestige which the Empire brought. It is difficult to pronounce on\r\neither side; but one feels that the old localism and individualism which\r\ncharacterized the early German, and had never, on German soil, been\r\ncombined with and counteracted by a large measure of Roman population\r\nand Roman civilization, as they were in Gaul and Spain, would in any\r\ncase have continued to divide and disturb Germany till late in her\r\nhistory, even if the Empire had never come to reside within her borders.\r\nOf the larger question of the influence of the Empire on Europe we can\r\nhere only say that it worked for good. An Empire which represented, as a\r\nHoly Empire, the unity of all the faithful as one body in their secular,\r\nno less than in their religious life--an Empire which, again, as a Roman\r\nEmpire, represented with an unbroken continuity the order of Roman\r\nadministration and law--such an empire could not but make for the\r\nbetterment of the world. It was not an empire resting on force, a\r\nmilitary empire; it was not, as in modern times empires have sometimes\r\nbeen, an autocracy warranted and stamped by the plebiscite of the mob.\r\nIt was an empire resting neither on the sword nor on the ballot-box, but\r\non two great ideas, taught by the clergy and received by the laity, that\r\nall believers in Christ form one body politic, and that the one model\r\nand type for the organization of that body is to be found in the past of\r\nRome. It was indeed the weakness of the Empire that its roots were only\r\nthe thoughts of men; for the lack of material force, from which it\r\nalways suffered, hindered it from doing work it might well have\r\ndone--the work, for instance, of international arbitration. Yet, on the\r\nother hand, it was the strength and glory of the Empire that it lived,\r\nall through the middle ages, an unconquerable idea of the mind of man.\r\nBecause it was a being of their thought, it stirred men to reflection:\r\nthe Empire, particularly in its clash with the Papacy, produced a\r\npolitical consciousness and a political speculation reflected for us in\r\nthe many _libelli de lite imperatorum et pontificum_, and in the pages\r\nof Dante and Marsilius of Padua. Roman, it perpetuated the greatest\r\nmonument of Roman thought--that ordered scheme of law, which either\r\nbecame, as in England, the model for the building of a native system,\r\nor, as in Germany from the end of the 15th century onwards, was received\r\nin its integrity and administered in the courts. Holy, it fortified and\r\nconsolidated Christian thought, by giving a visible expression to the\r\nkingdom of God upon earth; and not only so, but it maintained, however\r\nimperfectly, some idea of international obligation, and some conception\r\nof a commonwealth of Europe.[12]\r\n\r\nThe Holy Roman Empire of western Europe had in its own day a\r\ncontemporary and a rival--that east Roman empire of which we have\r\nalready spoken. From Arcadius to John Palaeologus, from A.D. 395 to\r\n1453, the Roman empire was continued at Constantinople--not as a theory\r\nand an idea, but as a simple and daily reality of politics and\r\nadministration. In one sense the East Roman Empire was more lineally and\r\nreally Roman than the West: it was absolutely continuous from ancient\r\ntimes. In another sense the Western Empire was the most Roman; for its\r\ncapital--in theory at least--was Rome itself, and the Roman Church stood\r\nby its side, while Constantinople was Hellenic and even Oriental.\r\nBetween the two Empires there was fixed an impassable gulf; and they\r\nwere divided by deep differences of thought and temper, which appeared\r\nmost particularly in the sphere of religion, and expressed themselves in\r\nthe cleavage between the Catholic and the Orthodox Churches. Yet, as\r\nwhen Rome fell, the Catholic Church survived, and ultimately found for\r\nitself a new Empire of the West, so, when Constantinople fell, the\r\nOrthodox Church continued its life, and found for itself a new Empire of\r\nthe East--the Empire of Russia. Under Ivan the Great (1462-1505) Moscow\r\nbecame the metropolis of Orthodoxy; Byzantine law influenced his code;\r\nand he took for his cognizance the double-headed eagle. Ivan the\r\nTerrible, his grandson, finally assumed in 1547 the title of Tsar; and\r\nhenceforth the Russian emperor is, in theory and very largely in fact,\r\nthe successor of the old East Roman emperor,[13] the head of the\r\nOrthodox Church, with the mission of vengeance on Islam for the fall of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Modern Empires.\r\n\r\nIn the 19th century the word \"empire\" has had a large and important\r\nbearing in politics. In France it has been the apanage of the\r\nBonapartes, and has meant a centralized system of government by an\r\nefficient Caesar, resting immediately on the people, and annihilating\r\nthe powers of the people's representatives. Under Napoleon I. this\r\nconception had a Carolingian colour: under Napoleon III. there is less\r\nof Carolingianism, and more of Caesarism--more of a popular\r\ndictatorship. While in modern France Empire has meant autocracy instead\r\nof representative government, in Germany it has meant a greater national\r\nunity and a federal government in the place of a confederation. The\r\nmodern German empire is at once like and unlike the old Holy Roman\r\nEmpire. It is unlike the old medieval Empire; for it has no connexion\r\nwith the Catholic Church, and no relation to Rome. But it is like the\r\nHoly Roman Empire of the 17th and 18th centuries--for it represents a\r\nfederation, but a more real and more unitary federation, of the several\r\nstates of Germany. The likeness is perhaps more striking than the\r\ndissimilarity; and in virtue of this likeness, and because the memory of\r\nthe old German _Kaiserzeit_ was a driving force in 1870, we may speak of\r\nthe modern German empire as the successor of the old Holy Roman Empire,\r\nif we remember that we are speaking of that Empire in its last two\r\ncenturies of existence. The modern \"Empire of Austria,\" on the other\r\nhand, does not connote an empire in the sense of a federation, but is a\r\nconvenient designation for the sum of the territories ruled by a single\r\nsovereign under various titles (king of Bohemia, archduke of Austria,\r\n&c.) and unified in a single political system.[14] The title of Emperor\r\nwas assumed, as we have seen, through an historical accident; and,\r\nthough the Habsburgs of to-day are personally the lineal descendants of\r\nthe old Holy Roman emperors, they do not in any way possess an empire\r\nthat represents the old Holy Empire. In England, of recent years, the\r\nterm \"Empire\" and the conception of imperialism have become prominent\r\nand crucial. To Englishmen to-day, as to Germans before 1870, the term\r\nand the conception stand for the greater unity and definitely federal\r\ngovernment of a number of separate states. For the German, indeed,\r\nEmpire has meant, in great measure, the strengthening of a loose federal\r\ninstitution by the addition of a common personal superior: to us it\r\nmeans the turning of a loose union of separate states already under a\r\ncommon personal superior--the King--into a federal commonwealth living\r\nunder some common federal institutions. But the aim is much the same; it\r\nis the integration of a people under a single scheme which shall be\r\nconsistent with a large measure of political autonomy. We speak of\r\nimperial federation; and indeed our modern imperialism is closely allied\r\nto federalism. Yet we do well to cling to the term empire rather than\r\nfederation; for the one term emphasizes the whole and its unity, the\r\nother the part and its independence. This imperialism, which is\r\nfederalism viewed as making for a single whole, is very different from\r\nthat Bonapartist imperialism, which means autocracy; for its essence is\r\nfree co-ordination, and the self-government of each co-ordinated part.\r\nThe British Empire (q.v.) is, in a sense, an aspiration rather than a\r\nreality, a thought rather than a fact; but, just for that reason, it is\r\nlike the old Empire of which we have spoken; and though it be neither\r\nRoman nor Holy, yet it has, like its prototype, one law, if not the law\r\nof Rome--one faith, if not in matters of religion, at any rate in the\r\nfield of political and social ideals.\r\n\r\n  Authorities.--See, in the first place, J.

(E. Br.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Bryce points out, with much subtlety and truth, that the rise of\r\n    a second Rome in the East not only helped to perpetuate the Empire by\r\n    providing a new centre which would take the place of Rome when Rome\r\n    fell, but also tended to make it more universal; \"for, having lost\r\n    its local centre, it subsisted no longer by historic right only, but,\r\n    so to speak, naturally, as a part of an order of things which a\r\n    change in external conditions seemed incapable of disturbing\" (_Holy\r\n    Roman Empire_, p. 8 of the edition of 1904).\r\n\r\n  [2] The _de facto_ importance of the event of 476 can only be seen in\r\n    the light of later events, and it was not therefore noticed by\r\n    contemporaries. Marcellinus is the only contemporary who remarks on\r\n    its importance, cf. _Marcellini Chronicon_ (_Mon. Germ. Hist.,\r\n    Chronica minora._ ii. 91), _Hesperium Romanae gentis imperium ... cum\r\n    hoc Augustulo periit ... Gothorum dehinc regibus Romam tenentibus._\r\n\r\n  [3] A passage in Malchus, a Byzantine historian (quoted by Bryce,\r\n    _Holy Roman Empire_, p. 25, note _u_, in the edition of 1904),\r\n    expresses this truth exactly. The envoys sent to Zeno by Odoacer urge\r\n    [Greek: os hidias men autois basileias ou deoi koinos de hapochresei\r\n    monos on autokrator hep amphoterois tois perasi]. The envoys then\r\n    suggest the name of Odoacer, as one able to manage their affairs, and\r\n    ask Zeno to give him, _as an officer of the Empire_, the title of\r\n    Patricius and the administration of Italy.\r\n\r\n  [4] According to the view here followed, the Church was the ark in\r\n    which the conception of Empire was saved during the dark ages between\r\n    600 and 800. Some influence should perhaps also be assigned to Roman\r\n    law, which continued to be administered during these centuries,\r\n    especially in the towns, and maintained the imperial tradition. But\r\n    the influence of the Church is the essential fact.\r\n\r\n  [5] In the 5th century the title _patricius_ came to attach\r\n    particularly to the head of the Roman army (_magister utriusque\r\n    militiae_) to men like Aetius and Ricimer, who made and unmade\r\n    emperors (cf. Mommsen, _Gesammelte Schriften_, iv. 537, 545 sqq.).\r\n    Later it had been borne by the Greek exarchs of Ravenna. The\r\n    concession to Pippin of this great title makes him military head of\r\n    the Western empire, in the sense in which the title was used in the\r\n    5th century; it makes him representative of the Empire for Italy, in\r\n    the sense in which it had been used of the exarchs.\r\n\r\n  [6] See the famous bull _Venerabilem_ (_Corp. Jur. Canon._ Decr.\r\n    Greg. i. 6, c. 34).\r\n\r\n  [7] Even on this view, an imperial coronation at the hands of the\r\n    pope was necessary to complete the title; but this was regarded by\r\n    the Germans (though not by the pope) as a form which necessarily\r\n    followed.\r\n\r\n  [8] It is a curious fact that imperial titles (_imperator_ and\r\n    _basileus_) are used in the Anglo-Saxon diplomata of the 10th\r\n    century. Edred, for instance (946-955) is \"imperator,\" \"cyning and\r\n    casere totius Britanniae,\" \"basileus Anglorum hujusque insulae\r\n    barbarorum\": Edgar is \"totius Albionis imperator Augustus\" (cf.\r\n    Stubbs, _Const. Hist._ i. c. vii. S 71). These titles partly show the\r\n    turgidity of English Latinity in the 10th century, partly indicate\r\n    the quasi-imperial position held by the Wessex kings after the\r\n    reconquest of the Dane-law. But there seems to be no real ground for\r\n    Freeman's view (_Norman Conquest_, i. 548 sqq.), that England was\r\n    regarded as a third Empire, side by side with the other Empires of\r\n    West and East Europe. That the titles were assumed in order to\r\n    repudiate possible claims of the Western Empire to the overlordship\r\n    of England is disproved by the fact that they are assumed at a time\r\n    when there is no Western emperor. The assumption of an imperial style\r\n    by Henry VIII., which is mentioned below, is explained by the\r\n    Reformation, and does not mean any recurrence to a forgotten\r\n    Anglo-Saxon style.\r\n\r\n  [9] It is in virtue of this aspect that the Empire is holy. The term\r\n    _sacrum imperium_ seems to have been first used about the time of\r\n    Frederick I., when the emperors were anxious to magnify the sanctity\r\n    of their office in answer to papal opposition. The emperor himself\r\n    (see under EMPEROR) was always regarded, and at his coronation\r\n    treated, as a _persona ecclesiastica_.\r\n\r\n  [10] The emperor claimed suzerainty over the greater part of Europe\r\n    at various dates. Hungary and Poland, France and Spain, the\r\n    Scandinavian peninsula, the British Isles, were all claimed for the\r\n    Empire at different times (see Bryce, _Holy Roman Empire_, c. xii.).\r\n    The \"effective\" empire, if indeed it may be called effective,\r\n    embraced only Germany, Burgundy and the _regnum Italiae_ (the old\r\n    Lombard kingdom in the valley of the Po).\r\n\r\n  [11] Cf. the Act 25 Henry VIII. c. 22, S 1: \"the lawful kings and\r\n    emperors of this realm.\"\r\n\r\n  [12] The Papacy, consistent to the last, formally protested at the\r\n    Congress of Vienna in 1815 against the failure of the Powers to\r\n    restore the Holy Roman Empire, the \"centre of political unity\" (Ed.).\r\n\r\n  [13] The Turks, occupying Constantinople, have also claimed to be the\r\n    heirs of the old emperors of Constantinople; and their sultans have\r\n    styled themselves _Keisar-i-Rum_.\r\n\r\n  [14] This does not, of course, apply to Hungary, which since 1867 has\r\n    not formed part of the Austrian empire and is ruled by the head of\r\n    the house of Habsburg not as emperor, but as king of Hungary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPIRICISM (from Gr. [Greek: empeiros], skilled in, from [Greek: peira],\r\nexperiment), in philosophy, the theory that all knowledge is derived\r\nfrom sense-given data. It is opposed to all forms of intuitionalism, and\r\nholds that the mind is originally an absolute blank (_tabula rasa_), on\r\nwhich, as it were, sense-given impressions are mechanically recorded,\r\nwithout any action on the part of the mind. The process by which the\r\nmind is thus stored consists of an infinity of individual impressions.\r\nThe frequent or invariable recurrence of similar series of events gives\r\nbirth in the mind to what are wrongly called \"laws\"; in fact, these\r\n\"laws\" are merely statements of experience gathered together by\r\nassociation, and have no other kind of validity. In other words from the\r\nempirical standpoint the statement of such a \"law\" does not contain the\r\nword \"must\"; it merely asserts that such and such series have been\r\ninvariably observed. In this theory there can strictly be no\r\n\"causation\"; one thing is observed to succeed another, but observations\r\ncannot assert that it is \"caused\" by that thing; it is _post hoc_, but\r\nnot _propter hoc_. The idea of _necessary_ connexion is a purely mental\r\nidea, an a priori conception, in which observation of empirical data\r\ntakes no part; empiricism in ethics likewise does away with the idea of\r\nthe absolute authority of the moral law as conceived by the\r\nintuitionalists. The moral law is merely a collection of rules of\r\nconduct based on an infinite number of special cases in which the\r\nconvenience of society or its rulers has subordinated the inclination of\r\nindividuals. The fundamental objection to empiricism is that it fails to\r\ngive an accurate explanation of experience; individual impressions as\r\nsuch are momentary, and their connexion into a body of coherent\r\nknowledge presupposes mental action distinct from mere receptivity.\r\nEmpiricism was characteristic of all early speculation in Greece. During\r\nthe middle ages the empiric spirit was in abeyance, but it revived from\r\nthe time of Francis Bacon and was systematized especially in the English\r\nphilosophers, Locke, Hume, the two Mills, Bentham and the associationist\r\nschool generally.\r\n\r\n  See ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS; METAPHYSICS; PSYCHOLOGY; LOGIC; besides the\r\n  biographies of the empirical philosophers.\r\n\r\n_In medicine_, the term is applied to a school of physicians who, in the\r\ntime of Celsus and Galen, advocated accurate observation of the\r\nphenomena of health and disease in the belief that only by the\r\ncollection of a vast mass of instances would a true science of medicine\r\nbe attained. This point of view was carried to extremes by those who\r\ndiscarded all real study, and based their treatment on rules of thumb.\r\nHence the modern sense of empirical as applied to the guess work of an\r\nuntrained quack or charlatan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPLOYERS' LIABILITY, and WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION.[1] The law of England\r\nas to the liability of employers in respect of personal injuries to\r\ntheir servants is regulated partly by the common law and partly by\r\nstatute; but by the Employers' Liability Act 1880, such exceptions have\r\nbeen grafted upon the common law, and by the Workmen's Compensation Act\r\n1906, principles so alien to the common law have been applied to most\r\nemployments that it is impossible now to present any view of this branch\r\nof the law as a logical whole. All that can be done is to state the\r\nnature of the liability at common law. the extension of it effected by\r\nthe Employers' Liability Act 1880, and the new liabilities introduced by\r\nlater acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Common law.\r\n\r\nAt common law the liability of a master is of a very limited character.\r\nThere is, of course, nothing to prevent a master and servant from\r\nproviding by special contract in any way they please for their mutual\r\nrights in cases of personal injury to the servant. In such cases the\r\nliability will depend upon the terms of the special contract. But apart\r\nfrom any special agreement, it may be broadly stated that a master is\r\nliable to his servants only for injuries caused by his own negligence.\r\nInjuries to a servant may arise from accident, from the nature of the\r\nservice, or from negligence; and this negligence may be of the master,\r\nof another servant of the master, or of a stranger. If the injury is\r\npurely accidental the loss lies where it falls. If it arises from the\r\nnature of the service, the servant must bear it himself; he has\r\nundertaken a service to which certain risks are necessarily incident; if\r\nhe is injured thereby, it is the fortune of war, and no one can be made\r\nresponsible. If the injury is caused by the negligence of a stranger,\r\nthe servant has his ordinary remedy against the wrong-doer or any one\r\nwho is responsible as a principal for the conduct of the wrong-doer. If\r\nit is caused by the negligence of a fellow-servant, he likewise has his\r\nordinary remedy against the actual wrong-doer; but, by virtue of what is\r\nknown as the doctrine of common employment, he cannot at common law make\r\nthe master liable as a principal. The only case (independently of modern\r\nlegislation: _see below_) in which he can recover damages from the\r\nmaster is where the injury has been caused by negligence of the master\r\nhimself. A master is negligent if he fails to exercise that skill and\r\ncare which, in the circumstances of the particular employment, are used\r\nby employers of ordinary skill and carefulness. If he himself takes part\r\nin the work, he must act with such skill and care as may reasonably be\r\ndemanded of one who takes upon himself to do work of that kind. If he\r\nentrusts the work to other servants, he must be careful in their\r\nselection, and must not negligently employ persons who are incompetent.\r\nHe must take proper care so to arrange the system of work that his\r\nservants are not exposed to unnecessary danger. If tools or machinery\r\nare used, he must take proper care to provide such as are fit and proper\r\nfor the work, and must either himself see that they are maintained in a\r\nfit condition or employ competent servants to do so for him. If he is\r\nbound by statute to take precautions for the safety of his servants, he\r\nmust himself see that that obligation is discharged. For breach of any\r\nof these duties a master is liable to his servant who is injured\r\nthereby, but his liability extends no further.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Common employment.\r\n\r\nThat his obligations to a servant are so much less than to a stranger is\r\nchiefly due to the doctrine of common employment. As a rule a master is\r\nresponsible for the negligence of his servant acting in the course of\r\nhis employment; but, from about the middle of the 19th century, it\r\nbecame firmly rooted in the law that this principle did not apply where\r\nthe person injured was himself a servant of the master and engaged in a\r\ncommon employment with the servant guilty of the negligence. In effect\r\nthis rule protects a master as against his servant from the consequences\r\nof negligence on the part of any other of his servants; to this there is\r\nno qualification except that, for the rule to apply, both the injured\r\nand the negligent servant must be acting in pursuance of a common\r\nemployment. They must both be working for a common object though not\r\nnecessarily upon the same work.\r\n\r\n  It is not easy to define precisely what constitutes a common\r\n  employment in this sense, and there is peculiarly little judicial\r\n  authority as to the limit at which work for the same employer ceases\r\n  to be work in a common employment. It does not depend on difference in\r\n  grade; all engaged in one business, from the manager to the\r\n  apprentice, are within the rule. It does not depend on difference in\r\n  work, if the work each is doing is part of one larger operation; all\r\n  the servants of a railway company, whether employed on the trains, or\r\n  at the stations, or on the line, are in a common employment. It does\r\n  not necessarily depend on difference of locality; a servant who packs\r\n  goods at the factory and a servant who unpacks them in the shop may\r\n  well be in a common employment. On the other hand, it is not enough\r\n  that the two servants are working for the same employer, if there is\r\n  nothing in common between them except that they are making money for\r\n  the same man; apart from special circumstances, the crews of two ships\r\n  owned by the same company are probably not in common employment while\r\n  navigating their respective ships. The test in each case must be\r\n  derived from the view, invented by the courts, upon which the doctrine\r\n  was based, namely, that the servant by entering upon the service\r\n  consented to run all the risks incidental to it, including the risk of\r\n  negligence on the part of fellow-servants; if the relation between the\r\n  two servants is such that the safety of the one may, in the ordinary\r\n  course of things, be affected by the negligence of the other, that\r\n  negligence must be taken to be one of the risks of the employment\r\n  assented to by the servant, and both are engaged in a common\r\n  employment. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred it will be found\r\n  that the doctrine is applicable, and the master protected from\r\n  liability. It is thus seen that, in general, no action will lie\r\n  against a master at the suit of his servant, unless the servant can\r\n  prove personal negligence on the part of the master causing injury to\r\n  the servant. And in such action the master may avail himself of those\r\n  defences which he has against a stranger. He may rely upon\r\n  contributory negligence, and show that the servant was himself\r\n  negligent, and that, notwithstanding the negligence of the master, the\r\n  injury was proximately caused by the negligence of the servant. Or\r\n  (except in cases where the injury results from a breach of a statutory\r\n  duty) he may prove such facts as establish the defence expressed in\r\n  the maxim, _volenti non fit injuria_; that is, he may prove that the\r\n  injured servant knew and appreciated the particular risk he was\r\n  running, and incurred it voluntarily with full understanding of its\r\n  nature. Mere knowledge on the part of the servant, or even his\r\n  continuing to work with knowledge, does not necessarily establish this\r\n  defence; it must be knowledge of such a kind and in such circumstances\r\n  that it can be inferred that the servant contracted to take the risk\r\n  upon himself. The action at common law is subject to the general rule\r\n  that personal actions die with the person; except so far as the remedy\r\n  for money loss caused by death by negligence has been preserved in\r\n  favour of a husband or wife and certain near relatives, under Lord\r\n  Campbell's Act (Fatal Accidents Act 1846).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The act of 1880.\r\n\r\nSuch was the law up to 1880. So long as industry was conducted on a\r\nsmall scale, and the master worked with his men, or was himself the\r\nmanager, its hardship was perhaps little felt; his personal negligence\r\ncould in many cases be established. But with the development of the\r\nfactory system, and the ever-growing expansion of the scale on which all\r\nindustries were conducted, it became increasingly difficult to bring\r\nhome individual responsibility to the employer. As industry passed\r\nlargely into the control of corporations, difficulty became almost\r\nimpossibility. The employer was not liable to a servant for the\r\nnegligence of a fellow-servant, and therefore, in most cases of injury,\r\nwas not liable at all. It is not surprising that the condition of things\r\nthus brought about, partly by the growth of modern industry and partly\r\nby the decisions of the courts, caused grave dissatisfaction. The\r\njustice of the doctrine of common employment was vigorously called in\r\nquestion. In the result the Employers' Liability Act 1880 was passed.\r\nThe effect of this act is to destroy the defence of common employment in\r\ncertain specified cases. It does not abolish the doctrine altogether,\r\nnor, on the other hand, does it impose upon the master any new standard\r\nof duty which does not exist as regards strangers. All that it does is\r\nto place the servant, in certain cases, in the position of a stranger,\r\nmaking the master liable for the negligence of his servants\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that they are in common employment with the\r\nservant injured. It is still necessary under the act, as at common law,\r\nto prove negligence, and the master may still rely upon the defences of\r\ncontributory negligence and _volenti non fit injuria_. But under the act\r\nhe cannot, as against the workmen who come within it and in the cases to\r\nwhich it applies, set up the defence that the negligence complained of\r\nwas the negligence of a servant in a common employment. The act does not\r\napply to all servants. It does not apply to domestic or menial servants,\r\nor to seamen, or to any except railway servants and \"any person who,\r\nbeing a labourer, servant in husbandry, journeyman, artificer,\r\nhandicraftsman, miner, or otherwise engaged in _manual_ labour ... has\r\nentered into or works under a contract with an employer, whether the\r\ncontract be oral or in writing, and be a contract of service or a\r\ncontract personally to execute any work or labour.\" Whether a servant,\r\nnot being one of those specially named, is within the act depends on\r\nwhether manual labour is the real and substantial employment, or whether\r\nit is merely incidental thereto; thus a carman who handles the goods he\r\ncarries may be within the act, but a tramcar driver or an omnibus\r\nconductor is not. The act does not make the master liable for the\r\nnegligence of all his servants, but, speaking generally, only for the\r\nnegligent discharge of their duties by such as are entrusted with the\r\nsupervision of machinery and plant, or with superintendence, or the\r\npower of giving orders, with the addition, in the case of a railway, of\r\nthe negligence of those who are given the charge or control of signals,\r\npoints, locomotive engines or trains. The cases dealt with by the act\r\nare five in number; in the first and fourth the words are wide enough to\r\ninclude negligence of the employer himself, for which, as has been seen,\r\nhe is liable at common law. In such instances the workman has an\r\nalternative remedy either at common law or under the act, but in all\r\nother respects the rights given by the act are new, being limitations\r\nupon the defence of common employment, and can be enforced only under\r\nthe act.\r\n\r\n  The first case is where the injury is caused by reason of any defect\r\n  in the condition of the ways, works, machinery or plant connected with\r\n  or used in the business of the employer, provided that such defect\r\n  arises from, or has not been discovered or remedied owing to the\r\n  negligence of the employer, or of some person in the service of the\r\n  employer and entrusted by him with the duty of seeing that the ways,\r\n  works, machinery or plant are in proper condition. The second case is\r\n  where the injury is caused by reason of the negligence of any person\r\n  in the service of the employer who has any superintendence entrusted\r\n  to him (that is, a person whose sole or principal duty is that of\r\n  superintendence, and who is not ordinarily engaged in manual labour)\r\n  whilst in the exercise of such superintendence. The third case is\r\n  where the injury is caused by reason of the negligence of any person\r\n  in the service of the employer to whose orders or directions the\r\n  workman at the time of the injury is bound to conform and does\r\n  conform, where such injury results from his so conforming. The fourth\r\n  case is where the injury is caused by reason of the act or omission of\r\n  any person in the service of the employer done or made in obedience to\r\n  the rules or by-laws of the employer, or in obedience to particular\r\n  instructions given by any person delegated with the authority of the\r\n  employer in that behalf, provided that the injury results from some\r\n  impropriety or defect in such rules, by-laws or instructions. The\r\n  fifth case is where the injury is caused by reason of the negligence\r\n  of any person in the service of the employer who has the charge or\r\n  control of any signal, points, locomotive engine or train upon a\r\n  railway.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases it is provided that the employer shall not be liable\r\nif it can be shown that the workman knew of the defect or negligence\r\nwhich caused his injury, and failed within a reasonable time to give, or\r\ncause to be given, information thereof to the employer or some person\r\nsuperior to himself in the service of the employer, unless he was aware\r\nthat the employer or such superior already knew of the said defect or\r\nnegligence. It was inevitable that these provisions should call for\r\njudicial interpretation, and a considerable body of authority has grown\r\nup about the act. Where general words are used, it must always occur\r\nthat, between the cases which are obviously within and those which are\r\nobviously without the words, there are many on the border line. Thus,\r\nunder the act, the courts have been called upon to determine the precise\r\nmeaning of \"way,\" \"works,\" \"machinery,\" \"plant,\" and to say what is\r\nprecisely meant by a \"defect\" in the condition of each of them. They\r\nhave had to say what is included in \"railway\" and in \"train,\" what is\r\nmeant by having \"charge\" or \"control,\" and to what extent one whose\r\nprincipal duty is superintendence may participate in manual labour\r\nwithout losing his character of superintendent, and what is the precise\r\nmeaning of negligence in superintendence. These are only illustrations\r\nof many points of detail which, having called for judicial\r\ninterpretation, will be found fully dealt with in the text-books on the\r\nsubject. A workman who, being within the act, is injured by such\r\nnegligence of a fellow-servant as is included in one or other of the\r\nfive cases mentioned above, has against his employer the remedies which\r\nthe act gives him. These are not necessarily the same as those which a\r\nstranger would have in the like circumstances; the amount of\r\ncompensation is not left at large for a jury to determine, but is\r\nlimited to an amount not exceeding such sum as may be found to be\r\nequivalent to the estimated earnings, during the three years preceding\r\nthe injury, of a person in the same grade employed during those years\r\nin the like employment and in the district in which the workman is\r\nemployed at the time of the injury. Moreover, the right to recover is\r\nhedged about with technicalities which are unknown at the common law;\r\nproceedings must be taken in the county court, within a strictly limited\r\ntime, and are maintainable only if certain elaborate provisions as to\r\nnotice of injury have been complied with. Where the injury causes death\r\nthe action is maintainable for the benefit of the like persons as are\r\nentitled under Lord Campbell's act in an action at common law.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acts of 1897 to 1906.\r\n\r\nThe law continued in this condition up to 1897. In the majority of cases\r\nof injury to a servant, the doctrine of common employment still\r\nprotected the master; and where, under the Employers' Liability Act, it\r\nfailed to do so, the liability was of a limited character and often,\r\nowing to technicalities of procedure, difficult to enforce. Moreover,\r\nthere is nothing in the act to prevent master and servant from entering\r\ninto any special contract they please; and in many trades it became a\r\ncommon practice for contracts to be made wholly excluding the operation\r\nof the act. In 1893 an attempt was made to alter the law by a total\r\nabolition of the defence of common employment, so as to make a master as\r\nliable to a servant as to a stranger for the negligence of any of his\r\nservants acting in the course of their employment, and at the same time\r\nto prohibit any agreements to forego the rights so given to the servant.\r\nThe bill did not become law, and no further change was made until, in\r\n1897, parliament took the first step in what has been a complete\r\nrevolution in the law of employers' liability. Up to that year, as has\r\nbeen seen, the foundation of a master's liability was negligence, either\r\nof the master himself, or, in certain cases, of his servants. But by the\r\nWorkmen's Compensation Act 1897, a new principle was introduced, whereby\r\ncertain servants in certain employments were given a right to\r\ncompensation for injuries, wholly irrespective of any consideration of\r\nnegligence or contributory negligence. As regards such servants in such\r\nemployments the master was in effect made an insurer against accidental\r\ninjuries. The act was confessedly tentative and partial; it dealt only\r\nwith selected industries, and even within these industries was not of\r\nuniversal application. But where it did apply, it gave a right to a\r\nlimited compensation in every case of injury by accident arising out of\r\nand in the course of the employment, whether that accident had been\r\nbrought about by negligence or not, and whether the injured servant had\r\nor had not contributed to it by his own negligence.\r\n\r\nThe act applied only to employment on, or in, or about certain\r\nlocalities where, at the same time, the employer was what the act called\r\nan \"undertaker,\" that is, the person whose business was there being\r\ncarried on. If we wanted to know whether a workman was within the act,\r\nwe had to ask, first, was he employed on, or in, or about a railway, or\r\na factory, or a mine, or a quarry, or an engineering shop, or a building\r\nof the kind mentioned in the act; secondly, was he employed by one who\r\nwas, in relation to that railway, &c., the undertaker as defined by the\r\nact; and thirdly, was he at the time of the accident at work on, or in,\r\nor about that railway, &c. Unless these three conditions were fulfilled\r\nthe employment was not within the act.\r\n\r\nThe employments to which the act applied comprised railways, factories\r\n(which included docks, warehouses and steam laundries), mines,\r\nengineering works and most kinds of buildings. \"Workman\" included every\r\nperson engaged in an employment to which the act applied, whether by\r\nmanual labour or otherwise, and whether his agreement was one of service\r\nor apprenticeship or otherwise, expressed or implied, oral or in\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nBy the Workmen's Compensation Act 1900, the benefits of the act of 1897\r\nwere extended to agricultural labourers.\r\n\r\nThe Workmen's Compensation Act 1906 (which came into force on the 1st of\r\nJuly 1907) extended the right of compensation for injuries practically\r\nto all persons in service, and also introduced many provisions not\r\ncontained in the acts of 1897 and 1900 (repealed). It does not apply to\r\npersons in the naval or military service of the crown (s. 9), or persons\r\nemployed otherwise than by way of manual labour whose remuneration\r\nexceeds two hundred and fifty pounds a year, or persons whose\r\nemployment is of a casual nature, and who are employed otherwise than\r\nfor the purposes of the employer's trade or business, or members of a\r\npolice force, or out-workers, or members of the employer's family\r\ndwelling in his house. But it expressly applies to seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Conditions of claim.\r\n\r\nTo entitle a workman engaged in an employment to which the act applies\r\nto compensation all the following conditions must be fulfilled: (1)\r\nThere must be personal injury by accident. This will exclude injury\r\nwilfully inflicted, unless the injury results in death or serious and\r\npermanent disablement, but the act introduces a new provision by making\r\nthe suspension or disablement from work or death caused by certain\r\nindustrial diseases \"accidents\" within the meaning of the act. The\r\nindustrial diseases specified in the 3rd schedule of the act were\r\nanthrax, ankylostomiasis, and lead, mercury, phosphorus and arsenic\r\npoisoning or their sequelae. But S 8 of the act authorized the secretary\r\nof state to make orders from time to time including other industrial\r\ndiseases, and such orders have embraced glass workers' cataract,\r\ntelegraphists' cramp, eczematous ulceration of the skin produced by dust\r\nor liquid, ulceration of the mucous membrane of the nose or mouth\r\nproduced by dust, &c. To render the employer liable the workman must\r\neither obtain a certificate of disablement or be suspended or die by\r\nreason of the disease. If the disease has been contracted by a gradual\r\nprocess, all the employers who have employed the workman during the\r\nprevious twelve months in the employment to which the disease was due\r\nare liable to contribute a share of the compensation to the employer\r\nprimarily liable. (2) The accident must arise out of and in the course\r\nof the employment. In each case it will have to be determined whether\r\nthe workman was at the time of the accident in the course of his\r\nemployment, and whether the accident arose out of the employment. It\r\nwill have to be considered when and where the particular employment\r\nbegan and ended. Other difficulties have arisen and will frequently\r\narise when the workman at the time of the accident is doing something\r\nwhich is no part of the work he is employed to do. So far as the\r\ndecisions have gone, they indicate that if what the workman is doing is\r\nno act of service, but merely for his own pleasure, or if he is\r\nimproperly meddling with that which is no part of his work, the accident\r\ndoes not arise out of and in the course of his employment; but if, while\r\non his master's work, he upon an emergency acts in his master's\r\ninterest, though what he does is no part of the work he is employed to\r\ndo, the accident does arise out of and in the course of his employment.\r\n(3) The injury must be such as disables the workman for a period of at\r\nleast one week from earning full wages at the work at which he was\r\nemployed. (4) Notice of the accident must be given as soon as\r\npracticable after the happening thereof, and before the workman has\r\nvoluntarily left the employment in which he was injured; and the claim\r\nfor compensation (by which is meant notice that he claims compensation\r\nunder the act addressed by the workman to the employer) must be made\r\nwithin six months from the occurrence of the accident or, in case of\r\ndeath, from the time of death. Want of notice of the accident or defects\r\nin it are not to be a bar to proceedings, if occasioned by mistake or\r\nother reasonable cause, and the employer is not prejudiced thereby. But\r\nwant of notice of a claim for compensation is a bar to proceedings,\r\nunless the employer by his conduct has estopped himself from relying\r\nupon it. (5) An injured workman must, if so required by the employer,\r\nsubmit himself to medical examination.\r\n\r\nWhen these conditions are fulfilled, an employer who is within the act\r\nhas no answer unless he can prove that the injury arose from the serious\r\nand wilful misconduct of the workman. The precise effect of these terms\r\nis not clear; but mere negligence is not within them.\r\n\r\nWhere the injury causes death, the right to compensation belongs to the\r\nworkman's \"dependents\"; that is, such of the members of the workman's\r\nfamily as were at the time of the death wholly or in part dependent upon\r\nthe earnings of the workman for their maintenance. \"Members of a family\"\r\nmeans wife or husband, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother,\r\nstep-father, step-mother, son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter,\r\nstep-son, step-daughter, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister. The\r\nact of 1906 makes also a very remarkable departure in including\r\nillegitimate relations in the direct line among \"dependents,\" for where\r\na workman, being the parent or grandparent of an illegitimate child,\r\nleaves such a child dependent upon his earnings, or, being an\r\nillegitimate child, leaves a parent or grandparent so dependent upon his\r\nearnings, such child or parent is to be included in the \"members of a\r\nfamily.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Amount.\r\n\r\nUnder the act compensation is for loss of wages only, and is, as has\r\nbeen said, based upon the actual previous earnings of the injured\r\nworkman in the employment of the employers for whom he is working at the\r\ntime of the injury. In case of death, if the workman leaves dependents\r\nwho were wholly dependent on his earnings, the amount recovered is a sum\r\nequal to his earnings in the employment of the same employer during the\r\nthree years next preceding the injury, or the sum of L150, whichever is\r\nthe larger, but not exceeding L300; if the period of his employment by\r\nthe same employer has been less than three years, then the amount of his\r\nearnings during the three years is to be deemed to be 156 times his\r\naverage weekly earnings during the period of his actual employment under\r\nthe said employer. If the workman leaves only dependents who were not\r\nwholly dependent, the amount recovered is such sum as may be reasonable\r\nand proportionate to the injury to them, but not exceeding the amount\r\npayable in the previous case. If the workman leaves no dependents, the\r\namount recoverable is the reasonable expenses of his medical attendance\r\nand burial, not exceeding L10. In case of total or partial incapacity\r\nfor work resulting from the injury, what is recovered is a weekly\r\npayment during the incapacity after the second week not exceeding 50% of\r\nthe workman's average weekly earnings during the previous twelve months,\r\nif he has been so long employed, but if not, then for any less period\r\nduring which he has been in the continuous employment of the same\r\nemployer; such weekly payment is not to exceed L1--and in fixing it\r\nregard is to be had to the difference between the amount of his average\r\nweekly earnings before the accident and the average amount which he is\r\nable to earn after the accident. Any payments, not being wages, made by\r\nthe employer in respect of the injury must also be taken into account.\r\nThe weekly payment may from time to time be reviewed at the request of\r\neither party, upon evidence of a change in the circumstances since the\r\naward was made, and after six months may be redeemed by the employer by\r\npayment of a lump sum. A workman is within the act although at the time\r\nof the injury he has been in the employment for less than two weeks, and\r\nalthough there are no actual earnings from the same employer upon which\r\na weekly average can be computed. But how are the average weekly\r\nearnings which he would have earned from the same employer to be\r\nestimated? The question must be determined as one of fact by reference\r\nto all the circumstances of the particular case. Suppose the workman to\r\nbe engaged at six shillings a day and injured on the first day. If it\r\ncan be inferred that he would have remained in such employment for a\r\nwhole week, his average weekly earnings from the same employer may be\r\ntaken at thirty shillings. If it can be inferred that he would have\r\nworked one day and no more, his average weekly earnings from the same\r\nemployer may be taken at six shillings.\r\n\r\nAll questions as to liability or otherwise under the act, if not settled\r\nby agreement, are referred to arbitration in accordance with a scheme\r\nprescribed by the act. Contracting out is not permitted, save in one\r\nevent: where a scheme of compensation, benefit or insurance for the\r\nworkmen of an employer has been certified by the Registrar of Friendly\r\nSocieties to be not less favourable to the workmen and their dependents\r\nthan the provisions of the act, and that where the scheme provides for\r\ncontributions by the workmen, it confers benefits at least equal to\r\nthose contributions, in addition to the benefits to which the workmen\r\nwould have been entitled under the act, and that a majority (to be\r\nascertained by ballot) of the workmen to whom the scheme is applicable\r\nare in favour of it, the employer may contract with any of his workmen\r\nthat the provisions of the scheme shall be substituted for the act;\r\nsuch certificate may not be for more than five years, and may in certain\r\ncircumstances be revoked. The act does not touch the workman's rights at\r\ncommon law or under the Employers' Liability Act, but the workman, if\r\nmore than one remedy is open to him, can enforce only one. When the\r\ncircumstances create a legal liability in some other person, e.g. where\r\nthe injury is caused by the negligence of a sub-contractor or of a\r\nstranger, in such cases the employer, if required to pay compensation\r\nunder the act, is entitled to be indemnified by such other person.\r\n\r\n  Under the Factory Acts, offences, when they result in death or bodily\r\n  injury to health, may be punished by fine not exceeding L100, and the\r\n  whole or any part of such fine may be applied for the benefit of the\r\n  injured person or his family, or otherwise as the secretary of state\r\n  determines. Similar provisions occur in the Mines Acts. Any sum so\r\n  applied must be taken into account in estimating compensation under\r\n  the Employers' Liability and Workmen's Compensation Acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Germany.\r\n\r\n_Law in Other Countries._--In _Germany_ (q.v.) there is a system of\r\ncompulsory state insurance against accidents to workmen. The law dates\r\nfrom 1884, being amended from time to time (1885, 1886, 1887, 1900,\r\n1903) to embrace different classes of employment. Occupations are\r\ngrouped into (1) industry; (2) agriculture; (3) building; (4) marine, to\r\nall of which one general law, with variations necessary to the\r\nparticular occupation in question, is applicable. There are also special\r\nprovisions for prisoners and government officials. Practically every\r\nkind of working-man is thus included, with the exception of domestic\r\nservants and artisans or labourers working on their own account. All\r\nworkmen and officials whose salary does not exceed L150 a year come\r\nwithin the law. No compensation is payable where an accident is caused\r\nthrough a person's own gross carelessness, and where an accident has\r\nbeen contributed to by a criminal act or intentional wrongdoing the\r\ncompensation may be refused or only partially allowed. With these\r\nexceptions, compensation for injury is payable in case of injury so long\r\nas the injured is unfit to work; in case of total incapacity an\r\nallowance is made equal to two-thirds of the injured person's annual\r\nearnings, in case of partial incapacity, in proportion to the degree\r\nthat his wage-earning capacity has been affected. In case of death the\r\ncompensation is either burial money or an allowance to the family\r\nvarying in amount from 20 to 60% of the annual earnings according to\r\ncircumstances. The provision of compensation for accidents falls\r\nentirely upon employers, and in order to lighten the burden thus falling\r\nupon them, and at the same time to guard against the possible insolvency\r\nof an individual employer, associations or self-administering bodies of\r\nemployers have been formed--usually all the employers of each particular\r\nbranch of industry in a district. These associations fix the amount of\r\ncompensation after each accident, and at the end of the year assess the\r\namount upon the individual employers. There is an appeal from the\r\nassociation to an arbitration court, and in particularly complicated\r\ncases there may be a further appeal to the imperial insurance\r\ndepartment. No allowance is paid until after the lapse of thirteen weeks\r\nfrom the accident, and in the meantime the injured person is supported\r\nfrom a sick fund to which the employers contribute one-third, the\r\nemployee contributing two-thirds. In Germany quite twelve millions of\r\nworkpeople are insured; in 1905 a sum of nearly eight millions sterling\r\nwas paid for accidents, and a million and a half to the families of\r\nthose killed in accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Austria.\r\n\r\nIn _Austria_ the compulsory insurance of workmen was provided for by a\r\nlaw of 1887, with subsequent amendments. Briefly, nearly every class of\r\nindustrial worker is included under the Austrian law, which is\r\nadministered by special territorial insurance institutions, each of them\r\nembracing particular classes of industries or workers. The institutions\r\nare managed by committees, one-third of the members of each committee\r\nbeing chosen by the minister of the interior, one-third by the employers\r\nand one-third by the workers. Compensation is payable, in case of\r\naccidents, on a scale proportionate to the injured person's wages during\r\nthe preceding year. In case of death, a certain sum is paid for funeral\r\nexpenses, an annuity to the widow, if one is left, equal to 20% of the\r\ndeceased's annual wages--if the widow remarries, she receives a lump sum\r\nequal to three annual payments in liquidation of the annuity--an annuity\r\nto each legitimate child equal to 15%, or, if the child has no mother,\r\nequal to 20% of the father's wages; an annuity to the father or mother,\r\nif dependent on the deceased for support, equal to 20% of the annual\r\nwages. As in the English act of 1906 illegitimate children are\r\nrecognized by being granted an annuity in the case of the death of a\r\nfather equal to 10% of his wages. In no case can the total amount of the\r\nannuities exceed 50% of the deceased's annual wages. Where the accident\r\nhas resulted in total incapacity, the workman receives an annuity equal\r\nto 60% of his wages. No allowance is paid until after the fourth week,\r\nduring which time the injured is supported by the sick-insurance\r\ninstitutions. The provision for the system is raised by contributions to\r\nthe extent of nine-tenths by the employers and one-tenth by the workers,\r\ndeducted from their wages. Instead of the German method by which an\r\nannual payment equal to the amount disbursed is required from each\r\nemployer, he is required to provide the full amount necessary for the\r\ncomplete payment of the pension, this amount being placed to the credit\r\nof a special insurance fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n  France.\r\n\r\nIn _France_ a system of compulsory state insurance against accidents was\r\ncreated by a law of 1898. The principal feature in the French law is the\r\nattempt to meet the possible insolvency of the employer by the\r\nestablishment of a special guarantee fund, created by a small addition\r\nto the \"business tax\" (_contribution des patentes_), and, in the case of\r\nthe mining industry, by a small tax on mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Norway.\r\n\r\n_Norway_, by a law of 1894, amended in 1897 and 1899, adopted a system\r\nof compulsory insurance modelled to a great extent on the German system.\r\nInstead, however, of a trade association as in Germany, or a district\r\ninsurance association as in Austria, there is a government insurance\r\noffice, in which employers have to insure their workmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Denmark.\r\n\r\nIn _Denmark_ a law was passed in 1897 rendering employers personally\r\nliable for the amount of compensation for accidents, but employers may\r\nrelieve themselves of this liability by insuring workmen in an assurance\r\nassociation approved of by the minister of the interior. This course,\r\nhowever, is discretionary with employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italy.\r\n\r\nIn _Italy_, although many attempts were made between 1889 and 1898 to\r\nintroduce a system of compulsory insurance, it was not until the latter\r\nyear that the principle was adopted. There is a National Bank for the\r\nInsurance of Working men against Accident (_Cassa Nazionale di\r\nAssicurazione per gli infortuni degli operaji sul lavoro_), created\r\nunder a law of 1883. It has special privileges, such as exemption from\r\ntaxation and the employment of the branch offices of the state\r\npost-office savings bank as local offices. Under the law of 1898 there\r\nis a primary obligation on the employer to insure his workmen with the\r\nNational Bank, but he may, if he prefers, insure with other societies\r\napproved by government. Employers employing about five hundred workmen\r\nmay, instead of insuring, establish a fund for the payment of not less\r\nthan the statutory compensation, subject to giving adequate security for\r\nthe sufficiency of the fund. Exemption from compulsory insurance is\r\ngranted to employers who have established a mutual insurance\r\nassociation, which must comply with certain prescribed conditions.\r\nRailway companies, also, are exempt, if they have relief funds which\r\nconform with the provisions of the act.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Spain.\r\n\r\nIn _Spain_ an act of the 30th of January 1900, adopted the principle of\r\nthe personal responsibility of the employer for accidents to workmen\r\nother than those due to vis major. The act also lays down regulations\r\nfor preventing accidents in dangerous trades, and releases the employer\r\nfrom personal liability on effecting adequate insurance of his workmen\r\nwith an approved insurance company.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Holland.\r\n\r\n_Holland_ has adopted the principle of compulsory insurance by a law of\r\nthe 2nd of January 1901. An employer has to pay the necessary premium to\r\nthe State Insurance Office, or by depositing adequate security with the\r\nState Office he may undertake the payment of the prescribed\r\ncompensation himself. Or he may transfer his liability to an insurance\r\ncompany, provided the company deposit adequate security with the State\r\nOffice. The State Insurance Office is under the management of directors\r\nappointed by the crown, and decides on all questions as to compensation;\r\nthere is also a \"Supervisory Board\" of the State Office with joint\r\nrepresentation of employers and workmen. There is an appeal from the\r\nState Office to Councils of Appeal, and from them to a National Board of\r\nAppeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Greece.\r\n\r\n_Greece_ has a law of the 21st of February 1901, providing for\r\ncompensation for accidents causing incapacity of more than four days'\r\nduration to workmen in mines, quarries and smelting works. The employer\r\nis exclusively liable for such compensation and for medical expenses\r\nduring the first three months; after that time he is liable for\r\none-half, the other half being borne by a miners' provident fund,\r\nsupported by certain taxes on the properties affected, fines, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sweden.\r\n\r\nBy a law of the 5th of July 1901, _Sweden_ adopted the principle of the\r\npersonal liability of the employer for industrial accidents. The\r\nemployer can, however, insure himself against liability in the Royal\r\nInsurance Institute. Compensation becomes payable after the expiration\r\nof sixty days from the date of the accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Russia.\r\n\r\n_Russia_ has a law which came into force on the 1st of January 1904.\r\nUnder this law employers in certain specified industries are bound to\r\nindemnify workers for incapacity of more than three days' duration due\r\nto injury arising out of their work. Employers are exempt from liability\r\nby insuring their workmen in insurance companies whose terms are not\r\nless favourable than those laid down by the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Belgium.\r\n\r\n_Belgium_ passed a law dealing with industrial accidents on the 24th of\r\nDecember 1903. It adopts the principle of the personal liability of the\r\nemployer in certain specified trades or industries. There is a power of\r\nextension to such other undertakings as may be declared dangerous by the\r\nCommission on Labour Accidents. Employers may exempt themselves from\r\ntheir liability by contracting for the payment of compensation by an\r\ninsurance company approved by the government or by the National Savings\r\nand Pension Fund. Where an employer does not so contract, he must (with\r\ncertain exemptions) contribute to a special insurance fund. The law of\r\n1903 also established a permanent Commission on Labour Accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Switzerland.\r\n\r\n_Switzerland_ in 1899 adopted a law providing for accident insurance,\r\nbut it was defeated on referendum in May 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n  United States.\r\n\r\nIn the _United States_ the law mainly depends on the doctrine of common\r\nemployment, and the extent to which this doctrine is applied varies\r\nconsiderably in the different states, more particularly as to who are\r\nand who are not to be regarded as fellow-servants. The tendency,\r\nhowever, has been to increase the liability of the employer for the\r\nnegligence of a fellow-servant, and in the case of employment on\r\nrailways many states have passed laws either modifying or abrogating the\r\ndoctrine. Colorado, by a law of 1901, has entirely abrogated it; and\r\nAlabama, Massachusetts and New York have laws generally similar to the\r\nEnglish act of 1880. But the greatest departure, due to the initiative\r\nof President Roosevelt, has been the passing by the Federal Congress of\r\nthe laws of April 22 and May 30, 1908, one giving damages to injured\r\nemployees of interstate carriers by railroad, and common carriers by\r\nrailroad in Territories, the District of Columbia, the Canal Zone and\r\nother territory governed by Congress, and the other giving regular wages\r\nfor not more than one year to injured employees of the U.S. government\r\nin arsenals, navy yards, construction work on rivers, harbours and\r\nfortifications, hazardous work in connexion with the Panama Canal or\r\nReclamation Service, and in government manufacturing establishments.\r\nThese national laws, which were intended to serve as an example to the\r\nstates, specifically provided for employers' liability and for the\r\nnon-recognition of the doctrine of common employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n  British Colonies.\r\n\r\nMost of the British colonial states have adopted the principle of the\r\nEnglish Workmen's Compensation Act of 1897, and the various colonial\r\nacts are closely modelled on the English act, with more or less\r\nimportant variations in detail. The New Zealand Act was passed in 1900,\r\nand amended in 1901, 1902, 1903 and 1905. The act of 1905 (No. 50) fixes\r\nthe minimum compensation for total or partial disablement at L1 a week\r\nwhen the worker's previous remuneration was not less than 30s. a week.\r\nSouth Australia passed a Workmen's Compensation Act in 1900 and Western\r\nAustralia one in 1902. New South Wales passed one in 1905, and British\r\nColumbia in 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] \"Employ\" comes through Fr. from Lat. _implicare_, to enfold, Late\r\n    Lat. to direct upon something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPOLI, a town of Tuscany, Italy, in the province of Florence, from\r\nwhich it is 20 m.

Andrea, founded in\r\n1093, still preserves the lower part of the original arcaded facade in\r\nblack, white and coloured marble. The works of art which it once\r\ncontained are most of them preserved in a gallery close by. Some of the\r\nother churches contain interesting works of art. The principal square is\r\nsurrounded by old houses with arcades. The painter Jacopo Chimenti\r\n(Jacopo da Empoli), 1554-1640, was born here. Empoli is on the main\r\nrailway line from Florence to Pisa, and is the point of divergence of a\r\nline to Siena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPORIA, a city and the county-seat of Lyon county, Kansas, U.S.A., on\r\nthe Neosho river, about 60 m. S.W. of Topeka. Pop. (1890) 7551; (1900)\r\n8223, of whom 686 were foreign-born and 663 were negroes; (1910 U.S.\r\ncensus) 9058. It is served by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe, and the\r\nMissouri, Kansas & Texas railways. The city has a Carnegie library, and\r\nis the seat of the state normal school and of the College of Emporia\r\n(Presbyterian; 1883). Emporia's industrial interests are mainly centred\r\nin commerce with the surrounding farming region; but there are small\r\nflour mills, machine shops, foundries and other manufacturing\r\nestablishments,--in 1905 the value of the factory product was $571,601.\r\nThe municipality owns and operates the water-works and the\r\nelectric-lighting plant. Emporia was settled in 1856 and was chartered\r\nas a city in 1870. The Emporia _Gazette_, established in 1890, was\r\npurchased in 1894 by William Allen White (b. 1868), a native of Emporia,\r\nwho took over the editorship and made a great stir in 1896 by his\r\neditorial entitled \"What's the matter with Kansas?\"; he also wrote\r\nseveral volumes of excellent short stories, particularly _The Court of\r\nBoyville_ (1889), _Stratagems and Spoils_ (1901) and _In Our Town_\r\n(1906).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPORIUM (a Latin adaptation of the Gr. [Greek: emporion], from [Greek:\r\nen], in, and stem of [Greek: poreuesthai], to travel for purpose of\r\ntrade) a trade-centre such as a commercial city, to which buyers and\r\ndealers resort for transaction of business from all parts of the world.\r\nThe word is often applied to a large shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPSON, SIR RICHARD (d. 1510), minister of Henry VII., king of England,\r\nwas a son of Peter Empson, an influential inhabitant of Towcester.\r\nEducated as a lawyer he soon attained considerable success in his\r\nprofession, and in 1491 was one of the members of parliament for\r\nNorthamptonshire and speaker of the House of Commons. Early in the reign\r\nof Henry VII. he became associated with Edmund Dudley (q.v.) in carrying\r\nout the king's rigorous and arbitrary system of taxation, and in\r\nconsequence he became very unpopular. Retaining the royal favour,\r\nhowever, he was made a knight in 1504, and was soon high steward of the\r\nuniversity of Cambridge, and chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster; but\r\nhis official career ended with Henry's death in April 1509. Thrown into\r\nprison by order of the new king, Henry VIII., he was charged, like\r\nDudley, with the crime of constructive treason, and was convicted at\r\nNorthampton in October 1509. His attainder by the parliament followed,\r\nand he was beheaded on the 17th or 18th of August 1510. Empson left, so\r\nfar as is known, a family of two sons and four daughters, and about 1513\r\nhis estates were restored to his elder son, Thomas.\r\n\r\n  See Francis Bacon, _History of Henry VII_., edited by J.R. Lumby\r\n  (Cambridge, 1881); and J.S. Brewer, _The Reign of Henry VIII_., edited\r\n  by J. Gairdner (London, 1884).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPYEMA (from Gr. [Greek: en], within, and [Greek: pyon], pus), a term\r\nin medicine applied to an accumulation of purulent fluid within the\r\ncavity of the pleura (see LUNG: _Surgery_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPYREAN (from the Med. Lat. _empyreus_, an adaptation of the Gr.\r\n[Greek: erpnros], in or on the fire, [Greek: pyr]), the place in the\r\nhighest heaven, which in ancient cosmologies was supposed to be occupied\r\nby the element of fire. It was thus used as a name for the firmament,\r\nand in Christian literature for the dwelling-place of God and the\r\nblessed, and as the source of light. The word is used both as a\r\nsubstantive and as an adjective. Having the same Greek origin are the\r\nscientific words \"empyreuma\" and \"empyreumatic,\" applied to the\r\ncharacteristic smell of burning or charring vegetable or animal matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMS, a river of Germany, rising on the south slope of the Teutoburger\r\nWald, at an altitude of 358 ft., and flowing generally north-west and\r\nnorth through Westphalia and Hanover to the east side of the Dollart,\r\nimmediately south of Emden. After passing through the Dollart the\r\nnavigable stream bifurcates, the eastern Ems going to the east, and the\r\nwestern Ems to the west, of the island of Borkum to the North Sea.\r\nLength, 200 m.\r\n\r\nBetween 1892 and 1899 the river was canalized along its right bank for a\r\ndistance of 43 m. At the same time, and as part of the same general\r\nplan, a canal, the DORTMUND-EMS CANAL, was dug to connect the river\r\n(from Munster) with Herne in the Westphalian coal-field. At\r\nHenrichenburg a branch from Herne (5 m. long) connects with another\r\nbranch from Dortmund (10-1/2 m. long). Another branch, from Olfen (north\r\nof Dortmund), connects with Duisburg, and so with the Rhine. There is,\r\nhowever, a difference in elevation of 46 ft. between the two branches\r\nfirst named, and vessels are transferred from the one to the other by\r\nmeans of a huge lift. The canal, which was constructed to carry small\r\nsteamers and boats up to 220 ft. in length and 750 tons burden, measures\r\n169 m. in length, of which 108-1/2 m. were actually dug, and cost\r\naltogether L3,728,750. The surface width throughout is 98-1/2 ft., the\r\nbottom width 59 ft., and the depth 8-1/6 ft.\r\n\r\n  See Victor Kurs, \"Die kunstlichen Wasserstrassen des deutschen\r\n  Reichs,\" in _Geog.

E. from\r\nCoblenz on the railway to Cassel and Berlin. Pop. 6500. It has two\r\nEvangelical, a Roman Catholic, an English and a Russian church. There is\r\nsome mining industry (silver and lead). Ems is one of the most\r\ndelightful and fashionable watering-places of Europe. Its waters--hot\r\nalkaline springs about twenty in number--are used both for drinking and\r\nbathing, and are efficacious in chronic nervous disorders, feminine\r\ncomplaints and affections of the liver and respiratory organs. On the\r\nright bank of the river lies the Kursaal with pretty gardens. A stone\r\nlet into the promenade close by marks the spot where, on the 13th of\r\nJuly 1870, King William of Prussia had the famous interview with the\r\nFrench ambassador Count Benedetti (q.v.) which resulted in the war of\r\n1870-1871. A funicular railway runs up to the Malberg (1000 ft.), where\r\nis a sanatorium and whence extensive views are obtained over the Rhine\r\nvalley. Ems is largely frequented in the summer months by visitors from\r\nall parts of the world--the numbers amounting to about 11,000\r\nannually--and many handsome villas have been erected for their\r\naccommodation. In August 1786 Ems was the scene of the conference of the\r\ndelegates of the four German archbishops, known as the congress of Ems,\r\nwhich issued (August 25) in the famous joint pronouncement, known as the\r\nPunctation of Ems, against the interference of the papacy in the affairs\r\nof the Catholic Church in Germany (see FEBRONIANISM).\r\n\r\n  See Vogler, Ems, _seine Heilquellen, Kureinrichtungen_, &c. (Ems,\r\n  1888); and Hess, _Zur Geschichte der Stadt Ems_ (Ems, 1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMSER, JEROME, or HIERONYMUS (1477-1527), antagonist of Luther, was born\r\nof a good family at Ulm on the 20th of March 1477. He studied Greek at\r\nTubingen and jurisprudence at Basel, and after acting for three years as\r\nchaplain and secretary to Raymond Peraudi, cardinal of Gurk, he began\r\nlecturing on classics in 1504 at Erfurt, where Luther may have been\r\namong his audience. In the same year he became secretary to Duke George\r\nof Albertine Saxony, who, unlike his cousin Frederick the Wise, the\r\nelector of Ernestine Saxony, remained the stanchest defender of Roman\r\nCatholicism among the princes of northern Germany. Duke George at this\r\ntime was bent on securing the canonization of Bishop Benno of Meissen,\r\nand at his instance Emser travelled through Saxony and Bohemia in search\r\nof materials for a life of Benno, which he subsequently published in\r\nGerman and Latin. In pursuit of the same object he made an unsuccessful\r\nvisit to Rome in 1510. Meanwhile he had also been lecturing on classics\r\nat Leipzig, but gradually turned his attention to theology and canon\r\nlaw. A prebend at Dresden (1509) and another at Meissen, which he\r\nobtained through Duke George's influence, gave him means and leisure to\r\npursue his studies.\r\n\r\nAt first Emser was on the side of the reformers, but like his patron he\r\ndesired a practical reformation of the clergy without any doctrinal\r\nbreach with the past or the church; and his liberal sympathies were\r\nmainly humanistic, like those of Erasmus and others who parted company\r\nwith Luther after 1519. As late as that year Luther referred to him as\r\n\"Emser noster,\" but the disputation at Leipzig in that year completed\r\nthe breach between them. Emser warned his Bohemian friends against\r\nLuther, and Luther retorted with an attack on Emser which outdid in\r\nscurrility all his polemical writings. Emser, who was further embittered\r\nby an attack of the Leipzig students, imitated Luther's violence, and\r\nasserted that Luther's whole crusade originated in nothing more than\r\nenmity to the Dominicans, Luther's reply was to burn Emser's books along\r\nwith Leo X.'s bull of excommunication.\r\n\r\nEmser next, in 1521, published an attack on Luther's \"Appeal to the\r\nGerman Nobility,\" and eight works followed from his pen in the\r\ncontroversy, in which he defended the Roman doctrine of the Mass and the\r\nprimacy of the pope. At Duke George's instance he prepared, in 1523, a\r\nGerman translation of Henry VIII.'s \"Assertio Septem Sacramentorum\r\ncontra Lutherum,\" and criticized Luther's \"New Testament.\" He also\r\nentered into a controversy with Zwingli. He took an active part in\r\norganizing a reformed Roman Catholic Church in Germany, and in 1527\r\npublished a German version of the New Testament as a counterblast to\r\nLuther's. He died on the 8th of November in that year and was buried at\r\nDresden.\r\n\r\nEmser was a vigorous controversialist, and next to Eck the most eminent\r\nof the German divines who stood by the old church. But he was hardly a\r\ngreat scholar; the errors he detected in Luther's New Testament were for\r\nthe most part legitimate variations from the Vulgate, and his own\r\nversion is merely Luther's adapted to Vulgate requirements.\r\n\r\n  Bibliography.--Waldau, _Nachricht von Hieronymus Emsers Leben und\r\n  Schriften_ (Anspach, 1783); Kawerau, _Hieronymus Emser_ (Halle, 1898);\r\n  _Akten und Briefe zur Kirchenpolitik Herzog Georgs von Sachsen_\r\n  (Leipzig, 1905); _Allgemeine deutsche Biographie_, vi. 96-98 (1877).\r\n  All histories of the Reformation in Germany contain notices of Emser;\r\n  see especially Friedensburg, _Beitrage zum Briefwechsel der\r\n  katholischen Gelehrten Deutschlands im Reformationszeitalter_.\r\n       (A. F. P.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENAMEL (formerly \"amel,\" derived through the Fr. _amail, esmal, esmail_,\r\nfrom a Latin word _smaltum_, first found in a 9th-century life of Leo\r\nIV.), a term, strictly speaking, given to the hard vitreous compound,\r\nwhich is \"fused\" upon the surface of metallic objects either for the\r\npurpose of decoration or utility. This compound is a form of glass made\r\nof silica, minium and potash, which is stained by the chemical\r\ncombination of various metallic oxides whilst in a melted condition in\r\nthe crucible. This strict application of the term was widened to signify\r\nthe metal object coated with enamel, so that to-day the term \"an enamel\"\r\ngenerally implies a work of art in enamel upon metal. The composition of\r\nthe substance enamel which is used upon metal does not vary to any great\r\nextent from the enamels employed upon pottery and faience. But they\r\ndiffer in this respect, that the pottery enamel is usually applied to\r\nthe \"biscuit\" surface of the ware in a raw state; that is, the compound\r\nhas not been previously \"run down\" or vitrified in the crucible by heat,\r\nas is the case with enamelling upon metal, although, in most of the\r\nenamelled iron advertisement tablets, the enamel is in the raw state and\r\nis treated in a similar manner to that employed upon pottery.\r\n\r\nExamination of the enamels upon brick of the Assyrians shows that they\r\nwere applied unvitrified. It was upon pottery and brick that the ancient\r\nEgyptians and Assyrians achieved their greatest work in enamelling. For\r\nas yet no work of such magnificence as the great enamelled walls of the\r\npalace of Rameses III. at Tell el-Yehudia in the Delta of the Nile, or\r\nthe palace of Nimrod in Babylon, has been discovered upon metal of any\r\nkind. But there were gold ornaments and jewelry enamelled of noble\r\ndesign in opaque turquoise, cobalt, emerald green and purple, some of\r\nwhich can be seen at the British Museum and the Louvre. An example is\r\nshown in Plate I. fig. 3.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent Greek and Roman civilizations enamel was also applied\r\nto articles of personal adornment. Many pieces of jewelry, exquisite in\r\nworkmanship, have been found. But a greater application was made of it\r\nby the Greek sculptors in the 4th and 5th centuries B.C. For we find, in\r\nmany instances, that not only were the eyes made of enamel--which\r\n(artistically speaking) is a somewhat doubtful manner of employing\r\nit,--as in the fine bronze head found at Anticythera (Cerigotto) in\r\n1902, but in the colossal figure of Zeus for the temple at Olympia made\r\nby Pheidias the gold drapery was gorgeously enamelled with figures and\r\nflowers. This wonderful work by the greatest sculptor the world has ever\r\nseen was destroyed, as so many priceless works of art in enamel have\r\nbeen: doubtless on account of the precious metal upon which they were\r\nmade. It was in all probability the crowning triumph of a long series of\r\nessays in this material. The art of ancient Rome lacked the inspiration\r\nof Greece, being mainly confined to copying Greek forms and style, and\r\nin the case of enamelling it did not depart from this attitude. But the\r\nRoman and Etruscan glass has many beautiful qualities of form and colour\r\nthat do not seem entirely borrowed, and the enamel work upon them so far\r\nas we can discern is of graceful design and rich colour. No doubt, were\r\nit not, as has been remarked, for the fact that enamelling was generally\r\ndone upon gold and silver, there would still be many works to testify to\r\nthe art of that period. Such as there are, however, show a rare\r\nappreciation of enamel as a beautiful material. With the decline of this\r\ncivilization the art of enamelling probably died out. For it has ever\r\nbeen one of those exquisite arts which exist only under the sunshine of\r\nan opulent luxurious time or sheltered from the rude winds of a poorer\r\nage by the affluence of patrons. The next time we hear of it is in an\r\noft-quoted passage (c. A.D. 240) from the writings of the great sophist\r\nPhilostratus, who says (_Icones_, i. 28):--\"It is said that the\r\nbarbarians in the ocean pour these colours into bronze moulds, that the\r\ncolours become as hard as stone, preserving the designs,\"--a more or\r\nless inaccurate description of the process of _champleve_. This has been\r\nunderstood (from an interpretation given to a passage in the commentary\r\non it by Olearius) to refer to the Celts of the British Islands. It also\r\ngoes to prove that enamelling was not practised at this day in Greece.\r\nWe have no British enamels to show so early as this, but belonging to a\r\nlater period, from the 6th to the 9th century, a number of the finest\r\ngold and bronze ornaments, horse trappings, shields, fibulae and ciboria\r\nhave been discovered of Celtic and Saxon make. The Saxon work has\r\nnothing to show so exquisitely wrought as that found in Ireland, where\r\none or two pieces are to be seen now in the Dublin Museum, notably the\r\nArdagh chalice and some gold brooches. In the chalice the enamel is of a\r\nminute inlaid character, and appears to have been made first in the form\r\nof a multi-colour bead, which was fused to the surface of its setting,\r\nand then polished down. Many of the pieces seem to have been made after\r\nthis fashion, which does not speak very highly of the technical\r\nknowledge of enamelling, but it is none the less true enamelling of an\r\nelementary character. The shield at the British Museum has an inlay of\r\nred enamel which is remarkable in its quality. For centuries such a\r\nfine opaque red has not been discovered. An example of Irish work is\r\nshown in Plate II. fig. 10.\r\n\r\nFrom Ireland the art was transferred to Byzantium, which is to be seen\r\nby the close resemblance of method, style, design and colour. The style\r\nand design changed in course of time, but the craft remained. It was at\r\nByzantium that it flourished for several centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Byzantine Cloisonne Cross (c. 11th century)\r\n(South Kensington Museum).]\r\n\r\nThe finest work we know of belonging to this period is the Pala d'Oro at\r\nSt Mark's, Venice, believed to have been brought from Constantinople to\r\nVenice about 1105. This magnificent altar-piece is in _cloisonne_\r\nenamel. A typical example is the ciborium and chalice belonging to the\r\nSouth Kensington loan collection. The design entirely covers the whole\r\nof the surface in one rich mass composed of circular or vesica-shaped\r\nmedallions filled with sacred subjects and foliated scrolls. These are\r\nengraved and enamelled, and the metal bands of the scrolls and figures\r\nare engraved and gilt. The characteristic quality of the colour scheme\r\nis that it is composed almost wholly of primaries. Red, blue and yellow\r\npredominate, with a little white and black. Occasionally the\r\nsecondaries, green and purple, are used, but through the whole period of\r\nByzantine enamelling there is a total absence of what to-day is termed\r\n\"subtle colouring.\" The arrangement of the enamels is also distinct, in\r\nthat the divisions of the colours are not always made by the cloison,\r\nbut are frequently laid in side by side without the adjoining colours\r\nmingling or running together whilst being melted. For instance, in a\r\nleaf pattern or in the drapery, the dress may be cobalt, heightened with\r\nturquoise or green. Thus it is interesting to observe that the artist\r\nemployed the metal dividing lines frequently for the sake of aesthetic\r\nresult, and was not much hampered by technical difficulties. This was\r\nthe rule when opaque enamels were used. It is also worthy of remark that\r\nthese opaque enamels differ from those in common use to-day, in that\r\nthey are not nearly so opaque. This quality, together with a dull,\r\ninstead of a highly polished surface, gives a much softer appearance to\r\nthe enamels. Again, the whole tone of the enamels is darker and richer.\r\nMany examples of Byzantine work (see fig. 1.) are to be seen in the\r\npublic and private art collections throughout Europe. They are\r\nprincipally upon ecclesiastical objects, missal covers, croziers,\r\nchalices, ciboria, pyx, candlesticks, crosses and tabernacles. In most\r\ninstances the enamels are made in separate little plates rudely fastened\r\nwith nails, screws or rivets to a metal or wooden foundation.\r\nTheophilus, a monk of the 13th century, describes the process of\r\nenamelling as it was understood by the Byzantines of his time, which\r\nprobably differed but little from earlier methods. The design and\r\ndrawing of the figures in Byzantine enamels is similar to the mosaic and\r\ncarving. The figures are treated entirely as decorations, with scarcely\r\never the least semblance of expression, although here and there an\r\nintention of piety or sorrow is to be descried through the awkward\r\npostures in which they are placed. In spite of this, the sense of\r\ndecorative design, the simplicity of conception, the strength of the\r\ngeneral character, and the richness of the colour, places this period as\r\none of the finest which the art of enamelling has seen, and it leads us\r\nto lay stress upon the principle that the simplest methods in design and\r\nmanipulation attain a higher end than those which are elaborate and\r\nintricate. It might be asserted with truth that this style never arrived\r\nat the degree of delicacy and refinement of later styles. But the\r\nrefinement was often at the expense of higher qualities.\r\n\r\nThe next great application of these kinds of enamelling was at Cologne,\r\nfor there we find not only the renowned work of Nicolas of Verdun, the\r\naltar front at Klosterneuberg, which consists of fifty plates in\r\n_champleve_ enamel, but in that Rhenish province there are many shrines\r\nof magnificent conception. From here the secrets of the craft were taken\r\nto Limoges, where the greatest activity was displayed, as numerous\r\nexamples are found throughout England, France and Spain, which no doubt\r\nwere made there (see Plate I. fig. 6.) But no new method or distinct\r\nadvance is to be noticed, during these successive revivals at Byzantium,\r\nCologne or Limoges, and it is to early 14th-century Italy that we owe\r\none of the most beautiful developments, that of the process subsequently\r\ncalled _basse-taille_, which signifies a low-cut relief upon which\r\ntransparent enamel is fused.\r\n\r\nIn this process enamelling passed from a decorative to a fine art. For\r\nit demanded the highest knowledge of an artist with the consummate skill\r\nof both sculptor and enameller. Witness the superb gold cup, called the\r\nKing's Cup, now in the British Museum, and the silver cup at King's\r\nLynn. The first is in an excellent state of preservation, as it is upon\r\ngold, but the latter, like most of the ancient enamelling upon silver,\r\nhas lost most of its enamel. This was due--as the present writer\r\nbelieves after much experiment--to the impurity of the silver employed.\r\nThe King's Cup is one of the finest works in enamelling extant. It\r\nconsists of a gold cup and cover, hammered out of pure gold; and around\r\nthe bowl, base and cover there are bands of figures, illustrating the\r\nscenes from the life of St Agnes. The hands and faces are of pale\r\njasper, which over the carved gold gives a beautiful flesh tone. The\r\ndraperies are in most resplendent ruby, sapphire, emerald, ivory, black\r\nand orange. The stem was subsequently altered by an additional piece\r\ninserted and enamelled with Tudor roses. It is a work of the 13th\r\ncentury, and belonged to Jean, duc de Berry, who gave it to his nephew,\r\nCharles VI. of France, in 1391. It afterwards came into the possession\r\nof the kings of England, from Henry VI. to James I., who gave it to Don\r\nJuan Velasco, constable of Castile. It was purchased by subscription\r\nwith the aid of the treasury for the British Museum.\r\n\r\nOther well-known pieces are the silver horn in the possession of the\r\nmarquess of Aylesbury, and the crozier of William of Wykeham at New\r\nCollege, Oxford. The discovery about the same time of the process called\r\n_plique-a-jour_ forms another most interesting and beautiful\r\ndevelopment. Owing to the difficulty of its manufacture and its extreme\r\nfragility there are very few examples left. One of the finest specimens\r\nis now at the Victoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington. It is in the\r\nform of two bands of emerald green enamel which decorate a silver\r\nbeaker. They are in the form of little stained glass windows, the\r\ncloisons forming (as it were) the leads. These fine cloisons and shapes\r\nare most correct in form, and the whole piece shows a perfection of\r\ncraftsmanship rarely equalled.\r\n\r\nThe end of the 15th century saw a development in enamelling which was\r\nnot only remarkable, but revolutionary in its method. For until then the\r\nwhole theory of enamelling had been that it relied upon the enclosing\r\nedges of the metal or the cloison to hold it to the metal ground and in\r\npart to preserve it in the shape of the pattern, much in the same way as\r\na setting holds a stone or a jewel. All the enamel before this date had\r\nbeen sunk into cells or cloisons. Two discoveries were made; first, that\r\nenamels could be made which require no enclosing ribbon of metal, but\r\nthat merely the enamel should be fused on both sides of the metal\r\nobject; secondly, that after an enamel had been fused to a surface of\r\nmetal, another could be superimposed and fused to the first layer\r\nwithout any danger of separation from each or from the metal ground. It\r\nis true that such processes had been employed upon glass on which enamel\r\nhad been applied, as well as upon pottery; and it is probably due to the\r\ninfluence of a knowledge of both enamelling upon metal and upon glass or\r\npottery that the discovery was made.\r\n\r\nIn most of these enamel paintings the subject was laid on with a white\r\nenamel upon a dark ground. The white was modulated; so that possessing a\r\nslight degree of translucency, it was grey in the thin parts and white\r\nin the thick. Thus was obtained a certain amount of light and shade.\r\nThis gave the process called _grisaille_. But strange to say, it was not\r\nuntil a later period that this was practised alone, and then the\r\nmodelling of the figures and draperies became very elaborate. At first\r\nit was only done in a slight degree, just sufficiently to give\r\nexpression and to add to the richness of the form. For the enamellers\r\nwere thinking of a plate upon which to put their wonderful colours, and\r\nnot only of form. The painting in white was therefore invariably\r\ncoloured with enamels. Probably the earliest painter in enamel was\r\nNardon Penicaud, many of whose works (one of them, dated 1503, is in the\r\nCluny Museum) have been preserved with great care. He had many\r\nfollowers, the most distinguished of whom was Leonard Limosin (i.e. of\r\nLimoges). He excelled in portraiture. Examples of his work (between 1532\r\nand 1574) are to be found in most of the larger public and private\r\ncollections. Leonard Limosin and his Limoges contemporaries were very\r\nlargely addicted to the employment of foil, which became too largely\r\nused, thus spoiling their otherwise fine serious work.\r\n\r\nThe family of Jean Penicaud, Jean Court de Vigier, Pierre Raymond and\r\nPierre Courteys were all great names of artists who excelled in the\r\n_grisaille_ process. _Grisaille_ is similar to _pate-sur-pate_ in\r\npottery, and depends for its attractive quality entirely upon form and\r\ncomposition. No comparison should be made with enamels in colour, for\r\nthey occupy a different category--similar to cameo.\r\n\r\nThe casket shown in Plate II. fig. 9 is by Jean Penicaud. It is a fine\r\nexample of the enamelling in this style, very beautiful in colour. The\r\nhands and faces are in opaque white enamel; the draperies, garlands and\r\nflowers are in transparent green, turquoise blue, purple and cobalt over\r\nfoil. The background is in transparent violet over white enamel ground,\r\nwhich is _seme_ with gold stars. The draperies are also heightened with\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nOne of the most marvellous pieces of brilliant craft is the missal cover\r\n(Plate I. fig. 5) at the South Kensington Museum, said to have belonged\r\nto Henrietta Maria, queen of Charles I. The subjects are the \"Creation\r\nof Adam and Eve\" and the \"Fountain of Youth.\" It is about 4 in. by 7\r\nwhen opened out. The enamel is encrusted upon the figures, ornament and\r\nflowers which are beaten up in pure gold into high relief. The\r\nextraordinary minuteness and skill of handling, and the extreme\r\nbrilliancy of the enamels, which are as brilliant to-day as on the day\r\nthey were made, together form one of the unique specimens of art\r\ncraftsmanship of the world. To the subdued taste of to-day, however, the\r\neffect is tawdry. The conception and design are also alike unworthy of\r\nthe execution.\r\n\r\nSince the Assyrian and Egyptian civilizations, there has been a\r\nsuccession of luxurious developments followed by lapses into the decline\r\nand death of the art of enamelling upon metals. In each revival there\r\nhas been something added to that which was known and practised before.\r\nThe last revival took place five hundred years ago, accompanying the\r\nrebirth of learning and the arts; but after flourishing for over a\r\ncentury, the art gradually fell into disuse, and remained so until the\r\nrecent revival and further development. The development consists, first,\r\nin the more complete knowledge of the technical processes, following\r\nupon the great advances which science has made; and secondly, in a finer\r\nand more subtly artistic treatment of them. The advance in technical\r\nknowledge comprises greater facility and perfection in the production of\r\nthe substance enamel, and its subsequent application to metal\r\nsurfaces; more intimate knowledge of metals and their alloys to which it\r\nis applied, and greater ease in obtaining them from the metalliferous\r\nores and reducing them to suitable dimensions and surfaces. For\r\ninstance, it is now a simple matter to obtain perfectly pure copper by\r\nmeans of electricity. Again, formerly a flat sheet of metal was obtained\r\nby hammering, which involved an infinite amount of hard labour, whereas\r\nit is accomplished to-day with ease by means of flatting and rolling\r\nmills: i.e. after the metal has been obtained from the ore in the form\r\nof an ingot, it is stretched equally to any degree of thinness by steel\r\nrollers. Further, the furnaces have been greatly improved by the\r\nintroduction of gas and electricity as the heating power, instead of the\r\nwood or charcoal employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate I.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3.--GRAECO-BACTRIAN GOLD AMULET, SHOWING THE GOLD STRIP FOR\r\n  SETTING STONES, WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE MANNER IN WHICH THE CLOISONS ARE\r\n  SOLDERED FOR CLOISONNE.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 4.--CHINESE CLOISONNE BOWL.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 5.--MISSAL COVER, ENCRUSTED ENAMEL.

(Irish, 9th century.)]\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of the substance enamel a much greater advance has\r\nbeen made, for whereas the colours, and consequently the schemes of\r\ncolour, were extremely limited, we now possess an infinite gradation in\r\nthe colours, as well as the transparency and opacity, the hardness and\r\nsoftness of enamels. There are only two colours which cannot yet be\r\nobtained; these are opaque vermilion and lemon yellow in a vitrified\r\nstate. Many of the colours we now employ were not known by enamellers\r\nsuch as Leonard Limosin. Our enamels are also perfect in purity,\r\nbrilliancy and durability, qualities which are largely due to the\r\nperfect knowledge of the proportion of parts composing an enamel and\r\ntheir complete combination. It is this complete combination, together\r\nwith the absence of any destructible matter, which gives the enamel its\r\nlasting quality.\r\n\r\nThe base of enamel is a clear, colourless, transparent vitreous compound\r\ncalled flux, which is composed of silica, minium and potash. This flux\r\nor base--termed _fondant_ in France--is coloured by the addition of\r\noxides of metals while in a state of fusion, which stain the flux\r\nthroughout its mass. Enamels are either hard or soft, according to the\r\nproportion of the silica to the other parts in its composition. They are\r\ntermed hard when the temperature required to fuse them is very high. The\r\nharder the enamel the less liable is it to be affected by atmospheric\r\nagencies, which in soft enamels produce a decomposition of the surface\r\nfirst and ultimately of the whole enamel. It is therefore advisable to\r\nuse hard enamels in all cases. This involves the employment of pure--or\r\nalmost pure--metals for the plates, which are in most respects the best\r\nto receive and retain the enamel. For if there is an excess of alloy,\r\neither the metal will possibly melt before the enamel is fused or\r\nafterwards they will part company. To the inferior quality of old silver\r\nmay be attributed the fact that in all cases the enamel has flown off\r\nit; if it has not yet wholly disappeared it will scale off in time. It\r\nis therefore essential that metals should be pure and the enamels hard.\r\nIt is also noteworthy that enamels composed of a great amount of soda or\r\npotash, as compared with those wherein red lead is in greater\r\nproportion, are more liable to crack and have less cohesion to the\r\nmetals. It is better not to use silver as a base, although it is capable\r\nof reflecting a higher and more brilliant white light than any other\r\nmetal. Fine gold and pure copper as thin as possible are the best metals\r\nupon which to enamel. If silver is to be used, it should be fine silver,\r\ntreated in the methods called _champleve_ and _cloisonne_.\r\n\r\nThe brilliancy of the substance enamel depends upon the perfect\r\ncombination and proportion of its component parts. The intimacy of the\r\ncombination depends upon an equal temperature being maintained\r\nthroughout its fusion in the crucible. For this purpose it is better to\r\nobtain a flux which has been already fused and most carefully prepared,\r\nand afterwards to add the colouring oxides, which stain it dark or light\r\naccording to the amount of oxide introduced. Many of the enamels are\r\nchanged in colour by the difference of the proportion of the parts\r\ncomposing the flux, rather than by the change of the oxides. For\r\ninstance, turquoise blue is obtained from the black oxide of copper by\r\nusing a comparatively large proportion of carbonate of soda, and a\r\nyellow green from the same oxide by increasing the proportionate amount\r\nof the red lead. All transparent enamels are made opaque by the addition\r\nof calx, which is a mixture of tin and lead calcined. White enamel is\r\nmade by the addition of stannic and arsenious acids to the flux. The\r\namount of acid regulates the density or opacity of the enamel.\r\n\r\nTo elucidate the development which has occurred, it will be necessary to\r\ndescribe some of the processes. After the enamel has been procured in\r\nthe lump, the next stage in the process, common to all methods of\r\nenamelling, is to pulverize it. To do this properly the enamel must\r\nfirst be placed in an agate mortar and covered with water; next, with a\r\nwooden mallet a number of sharp blows must be given to a pestle held\r\nvertically over the enamel, to break it; then holding the mortar firmly\r\nin the left hand, the pestle must be rotated with the right, with as\r\nmuch pressure as possible on the enamel, grinding it until the particles\r\nare reduced to a fine grain. The powder is then subjected to a series of\r\nwashings in distilled water, until all the floury particles are removed.\r\nAfter this the metal is cleaned by immersion in acid and water. For\r\ncopper, nitric acid is used; for silver, sulphuric, and for gold\r\nhydrochloric acid. All trace of acid is then removed, first by\r\nscratching with a brush and water, and finally by drying in warm oak\r\nsawdust. After this the pulverized enamel is carefully and evenly spread\r\nover those parts of the metal designed to receive it, in sufficient\r\nthickness just to cover them and no more. The piece is then dried in\r\nfront of the furnace, and when dry is placed gently on a fire-clay or\r\niron _planche_, and introduced carefully into the muffle of the furnace,\r\nwhich is heated to a bright pale red. It is now attentively watched\r\nuntil the enamel shines all over, when it is withdrawn from the furnace.\r\nThe firing of enamel, unlike that of glass or pottery, takes only a few\r\nminutes, and in nearly all processes no annealing is required.\r\n\r\nThe following are the different modes of enamelling: _champleve,\r\ncloisonne, basse-taille, plique-a-jour, painted enamel, encrusted,_ and\r\n_miniature-painted_. These processes were known at successive periods of\r\nancient art in the order in which they are named. To-day they are known\r\nin their entirety. Each has been largely developed and improved. No new\r\nmethod has been discovered, although variations have been introduced\r\ninto all. The most important are those connected with painted enamels,\r\nencrusted enamels and _plique-a-jour_.\r\n\r\n_Champleve enamelling_ is done by cutting away troughs or cells in the\r\nplate, leaving a metal line raised between them, which forms the outline\r\nof the design. In these cells the pulverized enamel is laid and then\r\nfused; afterwards it is filed with a corundum file, then smoothed with a\r\npumice stone and polished by means of crocus powder and rouge. An\r\nexample is shown in Plate II. fig. 8.\r\n\r\nIn _cloisonne enamel_, upon a metal plate or shape, thin metal strips\r\nare bent to the outline of the pattern, then fixed by silver solder or\r\nby the enamel itself. These strips form a raised outline, giving cells\r\nas in the case of _champleve_. The rest of the process is identical with\r\nthat of _champleve_ enamelling. An example is shown in Plate I. fig. 4.\r\n\r\nThe _basse-taille_ process is also a combination of metal work in the\r\nform of engraving, carving and enamelling. The metal, either silver or\r\ngold, is engraved with a design, and then carved into a bas-relief\r\n(below the general surface of the metal like an Egyptian bas-relief) so\r\nthat when the enamel is fused it is level with the uncarved parts of the\r\ndesign enamel, and the design shows through the transparent enamel.\r\n\r\n_Painted enamels_ are different from any of these processes both in\r\nmethod and in result. The metal in this case is either copper, silver or\r\ngold, but usually copper. It is cut with shears into a plate of the size\r\nrequired, and slightly domed with a burnisher or hammer, after which it\r\nis cleaned by acid and water. Then the enamel is laid equally over the\r\nwhole surface both back and front, and afterwards \"fired.\" The first\r\ncoat of enamel being fixed, the design is carried out, first by laying\r\nit in white enamel or any other which is opaque and most advantageous\r\nfor subsequent coloration.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a _grisaille painted enamel_ the white is mixed with\r\nwater or turpentine, or spike oil of lavender, or essential oil of\r\npetroleum (according to the taste of the artist) and the white is\r\npainted thickly in the light parts and thinly in the grey ones, whereby\r\na slight sense of relief is obtained and a great degree of light and\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nIn _coloured painted enamels_ the white is coloured by transparent\r\nenamels spread over the _grisaille_ treatment, parts of which when fired\r\nare heightened by touches of gold, usually painted in lines. Other parts\r\ncan be made more brilliant by the use of foil, over which the\r\ntransparent enamels are placed and then fired. An example is shown in\r\nPlate I. fig. 7.\r\n\r\nEnamels by the _plique-a-jour_ method might be best described as\r\n_translucent cloisonne_ enamels; for they are similar to cloisonne,\r\nexcept that the ground upon which they are fired is removed, thus making\r\nthem transparent like stained glass.\r\n\r\nTwo new processes have been the subject of the present writer's study\r\nand experiment for several years, which he has lately brought to\r\nfruition. The first is an inlay of transparent enamels similar to\r\n_plique-a-jour_ without cloisons to divide the colours. For if enamels\r\ndo not run together whilst in a melted state, as is seen in the case of\r\npainted and _basse-taille_ enamels, there should be no necessity for it\r\nin this process. The result is a clear transparent subject in colour.\r\nThe other process consists of a coloured enamel relief. It resembles the\r\ndella Robbia relief, with this important difference, that the colour of\r\nthe enamel by its nature permeates the whole depth of the relief,\r\nwhereas in the della Robbia ware it is only on the surface. It also has\r\na fresco surface, instead of one highly glazed. The quality of the\r\nenamel is as rare and unlike anything else as it is beautiful. It is in\r\npoint of fact the only coloured sculpture in which the whole of its\r\nparts are one solid homogeneous mass, and through which the colour is\r\none with the substance and is not applied. The process consists of the\r\nshapes of the various parts of the relief being selected for the\r\ndifferent enamels, and these enamels melted together, in the mould of\r\nthe relief, which is finished with lapidary's tools.\r\n\r\n_Miniature enamel painting_ is not true enamelling, for after the white\r\nenamel is fired upon the gold plate, the colours used are not vitreous\r\ncompounds--not enamels in fact--as is the case in any other form of\r\nmetal enamelling; but they are either raw oxides or other forms of\r\nmetal, with a little flux added, not combined. These colours are painted\r\non the white enamel, and afterwards made to adhere to the surface by\r\npartially fusing the enamel, which when in a state of partial fusion\r\nbecomes viscous.\r\n\r\nThere are many of these so-called enamels to-day, which are much easier\r\nof accomplishment than the true enamel, but they possess none of the\r\nbeautiful quality of the latter. It is most apparent when parts of a\r\nwork are true enamels and parts are done in the manner described above.\r\nThese enamel paintings on enamel are afterwards coated over with a\r\ntransparent flux, which gives them a surface of enamel. Many are done in\r\nthis way for the market.\r\n\r\nAll these methods were used formerly, before the present revival; but\r\nthey were not so completely understood or carried so far as they are\r\nto-day. Nor were the whole methods practised by any artist as they are\r\nnow. The greatest advance has been in painted enamels. This process\r\nrequires that both sides of the metal plate shall be covered with\r\nenamel; for this reason the plate is made convex on the top, so that the\r\nconcave side does not touch the _planche_ on which it is supported for\r\nfiring, but rests on its edges throughout. There are several reasons why\r\nthese plates are _bombe_, the principal one being that in the firing\r\nthey resist the tendency to warp and curl up at the edges as a flat thin\r\nplate would do. Further, the enamel having been fused to both sides is\r\nnot so liable to crack or to splint in subsequent firings. This is most\r\nimportant, for otherwise the white which is placed on afterwards would\r\nbe a network of cracks. The manner of firing has also to do with this,\r\nbut not nearly so much as the preliminary care and mechanical perfection\r\nwith which a plate is prepared. Nearly all the old enamels are seen to\r\nbe cracked in the white if minutely examined. To obviate this the\r\nfollowing points must be observed: The plate must be of an excellent\r\nquality of metal, equal in thickness throughout, and perfectly regular\r\nin shape. It must be arched equally from end to end. The first coat of\r\nenamel must be of a perfectly regular equal thickness on both sides,\r\nentirely covering the plate. Whatever the medium employed in painting\r\nthe white on to the enamel, it must be completely evaporated before the\r\nplate is placed in the furnace. The furnace must be heated to a bright\r\nred heat, and the _planche_ must be red-hot before being taken out for\r\nthe enamel to be placed upon it, and then quickly returned to the\r\nfurnace and the muffle door shut tight so as to allow no draught of cool\r\nair to enter it. Then as soon as it has begun to fuse, which if a small\r\npiece, it would do in a minute or so, the muffle door is slightly opened\r\nto afford a view of it. As soon as it shines all over its surface, it is\r\nwithdrawn from the muffle.\r\n\r\nThe method of laying a white upon the enamel ground is a matter of\r\nindividual taste, so far as the medium is concerned. By some, pure\r\ndistilled water is preferred to any other liquid for mixing the enamel.\r\nOtherwise, turpentine and the fat oil of turpentine, as well as spike\r\noil of lavender. The oil mixture takes longer to dry, and thus gives a\r\ngreater chance for modelling into fine shades than the water. But it has\r\nseveral drawbacks. Firstly, there is the difficulty of drying the oil\r\nout--a process which takes some time and increases the risk of cracking\r\nin the drying process; and secondly, the enamel is not so fresh and\r\nclear after it is fired as when pure water has been employed. Besides\r\nthere is a great difference in the result; the water involves a quick,\r\ndecided, direct touch and method, which carries with it its own charm.\r\nThe oil medium, besides giving an effect of laborious rounded stippled\r\nsurfaces, is apt partly to reduce the enamel, thus giving it a dull\r\nsurface. The coloration of the white is comparatively simple and is done\r\nby transparent enamels finely ground and evenly spread over the white\r\nafter the latter has been fused. The only danger to be avoided is that\r\nof over-firing, which is produced by too great heat of a prolonged\r\nduration of firing, which causes the stannic and arsenious acids in the\r\nwhite to volatilize.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Modern French plique-a-jour bowl, by Fernand\r\nThesmar.]\r\n\r\n_Plique-a-jour_ enamelling is done in the same way as _cloisonne_\r\nenamelling, except that the wires or strips of metal which enclose the\r\nenamel are not soldered to the metal base, but are soldered to each\r\nother only. Then these are simply placed upon a sheet of platinum,\r\ncopper, silver, gold or hard brass, which, after the enamel is fused and\r\nsufficiently annealed and cooled, is easily removed. For small pieces of\r\n_plique-a-jour_ there is no necessity to apply any metallic base, as the\r\nparticles of enamel quickly fuse, become viscous, and when drawn out set\r\nquite hard. Neither is there any need for annealing, as would be the\r\ncase in larger work. For an example, see fig. 2.\r\n\r\nCommercially there has lately been an activity in enamels such as has\r\nnever before occurred. This has been the case throughout Europe, Japan\r\nand the United States of America. In London there has been a demand for\r\na cheap form of gaudy coloured enamel, fused into sunk spaces of metal\r\nobtained by stamping with a steel die; this has been applied to small\r\nobjects of cheap jewelry, in the form of brooches, bracelets and the\r\nlike. There has also been a great demand for enamel watch-cases and\r\nsmall pendants, done mainly by hand, of a better class of work. Many of\r\nthese have been produced in Birmingham, Berlin, Paris and London. In\r\nParis copies of pictures in black and white enamel, with a little gold\r\npaint in the draperies and background, have been manufactured in very\r\nlarge quantities and sometimes of great dimensions. Another curious\r\ndemand, followed by as astonishing a production, is that of the\r\nimitations (a harder name for which is \"forgeries\") of old enamels, made\r\nwith much skill, giving all the technical excellence of the originals,\r\neven to the cracks and scratches incidental to age. These are duly\r\nsigned, and will deceive the most expert. They are copies of enamels by\r\nNardon and Jean Penicaud, Leonard Limosin, Pierre Raymond, Courtois and\r\nothers. The same artificers also produce copies of old Chinese\r\n_cloisonne_ and _champleve_ enamels, as well as old Battersea enamel\r\nsnuff-boxes, patch-boxes, and indeed every kind of enamelling formerly\r\npractised. It is advisable for the collector never to purchase any piece\r\nof enamelling as the work of an old master without having a pedigree\r\nextending at least over forty years. From Japan there has been a\r\ncontinuous flow of _cloisonne_ enamelled vases, boxes and plates, either\r\nentirely covered with enamel or applied in parts. Compared with this\r\nenormous output, only a few small pieces of jewelry have come from\r\nJaipur and other towns in India. There has also been a great quantity of\r\n_plique-a-jour_ enamelling manufactured in Russia, Norway and Sweden.\r\nAnd finally, it has been used in an unprecedented manner in large pieces\r\nupon iron and copper for purposes of advertisement.\r\n\r\nAmongst the chief workers in the modern revival of this art are Claudius\r\nPopelin, Alfred Meyer, Paul Grandhomme, Fernand Thesmar, Hubert von\r\nHerkomer and Alexander Fisher. The work of Claudius Popelin is\r\ncharacterized by good technical skill, correctness, and a careful\r\ncopying of the work of the old masters. Consequently it suffers from a\r\nlack of invention and individuality. His work was devoted to the\r\nrendering of mythological subjects and fanciful portraits of historical\r\npeople. Alfred Meyer and Grandhomme are both accomplished and careful\r\nenamellers; the former is a painter enameller and the author of a book\r\ndealing technically with enamelling. Grandhomme paints mythological\r\nsubjects and portraits in a very tender manner, with considerably more\r\nartistic feeling than either Meyer or Popelin. There is a specimen of\r\nhis work in the Luxemburg Museum. Fernand Thesmar is the great reviver\r\nof _plique-a-jour_ enamelling in France. Specimens of his work are\r\npossessed by the art museums throughout Europe, and one is to be seen in\r\nthe Victoria and Albert Museum, London. They are principally valued on\r\naccount of their perfect technical achievement. Lucien Falize was an\r\nemployer of artists and craftsmen, and to him we are indebted for the\r\nproduction of specimens of _basse-taille_ enamel upon silver and gold,\r\nas well as for a book reviewing the revival of the art in France,\r\nbearing particularly on the work of Claudius Popelin. Until within\r\nrecent years there was a clear division between the art and the crafts\r\nin the system of producing art objects. The artist was one person and\r\nthe workman another. It is now acknowledged that the artist must also be\r\nthe craftsman, especially in the higher branches of enamelling. M.\r\nFalize initiated the production of a gold cup which was enamelled in the\r\n_basse-taille_ manner. The band of figures was designed by Olivier\r\nMerson, the painter, and carved by a metal carver and enamelled by an\r\nenameller, both able craftsmen employed by M. Falize. Other pieces of\r\nenamelling in _champleve_ and _cloisonne_ were also produced under his\r\nsupervision and on this system; therefore lacking the one quality which\r\nwould make them complete as an expression of artistic emotion by the\r\nartist's own hands. M. Rene Lalique is among the jewellers who have\r\napplied enamelling to their work in a peculiarly technically perfect\r\nmanner. In England, Professor Hubert von Herkomer has produced painted\r\nenamels of considerable dimensions, aiming at the execution of pictures\r\nin enamel, such as have been generally regarded as peculiar to the\r\nprovince of oil or water-colour painting. Among numerous works is a\r\nlarge shield, into which plaques of enamel are inserted, as well as\r\nseveral portraits, one of which, made in several pieces, is 6 ft.\r\nhigh--a portrait of the emperor William II. of Germany. The present\r\nwriter rediscovered the making of many enamels, the secrets of which had\r\nbeen jealously guarded. He has worked in all these processes, developing\r\nthem from the art side, and helping to make enamelling not only a\r\ndecorative adjunct to metal-work, but raising it to a fine art. His work\r\nmay be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and Brussels Museum.\r\nOthers who have been enamelling with success in various branches, and\r\nwho have shown individuality in their work, are Mr John Eyre, Mrs Nelson\r\nDawson, Miss Hart.\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE.--Among older books on enamelling, apart from the works of\r\n  Neri and Benvenuto Cellini, are J.-P. Ferrand, _L'Art du feu, ou de\r\n  peindre en email_ (1721); Labarte, _Recherches sur la peinture en\r\n  email_ (Paris, 1856); Marquis de Laborde, _Notice des emaux du Louvre_\r\n  (Paris, 1852); Reboulleau, _Nouveau manuel complet de la peinture en\r\n  verre, sur porcelaine et sur email_ (ed. by Magnier, Paris, 1866);\r\n  Claudius Popelin, _L'Email des peintres_ (Paris, 1866); Emil Molinier,\r\n  _Dictionnaire des emailleurs_ (1885).

Fi.*).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENCAENIA, a festival commemorating a dedication, in Greek [Greek: ta\r\nhenkainia] ([Greek: kainos], new), particularly used of the anniversary\r\nof the dedication of a church (see DEDICATION). The term is also used at\r\nthe university of Oxford of the annual Commemoration, held in June, of\r\nfounders and benefactors (see OXFORD).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENCAUSTIC PAINTING. The name _encaustic_ (from the Greek for \"burnt in\")\r\nis applied to paintings executed with vehicles in which wax is the chief\r\ningredient. The term was appropriately applied to the ancient methods of\r\npainting in wax, because these required heat to effect them. Wax may be\r\nused as a vehicle for painting without heat being requisite;\r\nnevertheless the ancient term _encaustic_ has been retained, and is\r\nindiscriminately applied to all methods of painting in wax. The\r\ndurability of wax, and its power of resisting the effects of the\r\natmosphere, were well known to the Greeks, who used it for the\r\nprotection of their sculptures. As a vehicle for painting it was\r\ncommonly employed by them and by the Romans and Egyptians; but in recent\r\ntimes it has met with only a limited application. Of modern encaustic\r\npaintings those by Schnorr in the Residenz at Munich are the most\r\nimportant. Modern paintings in wax, in their chromatic range and in\r\ntheir general effect, occupy a middle place between those executed in\r\noil and in fresco. Wax painting is not so easy as oil, but presents\r\nfewer technical difficulties than fresco.\r\n\r\nAncient authors often make mention of _encaustic_, which, if it had been\r\ndescribed by the word _inurere_, to burn in, one might have supposed to\r\nhave been a species of enamel painting. But the expressions \"incausto\r\npingere,\" \"pictura encaustica,\" \"ceris pingere,\" \"pictura inurere,\" used\r\nby Pliny and other ancient writers, make it clear that some other\r\nspecies of painting is meant. Pliny distinguishes three species of\r\nencaustic painting. In the first they used a stylus, and painted either\r\non ivory or on polished wood, previously saturated with some certain\r\ncolour; the point of the stylus or stigma served for this operation, and\r\nits broad or blade end cleared off the small filaments which arose from\r\nthe outlines made by the stylus in the wax preparation. In the second\r\nmethod it appears that the wax colours, being prepared beforehand, and\r\nformed into small cylinders for use, were smoothly spread by the spatula\r\nafter the outlines were determined, and thus the picture was proceeded\r\nwith and finished. By the side of the painter stood a brazier which was\r\nused to heat the spatula and probably the prepared colours. This is the\r\nmethod which was probably used by the painters who decorated the houses\r\nof Herculaneum and of Pompeii, as artists practising this method of\r\npainting are depicted in the decorations. The third method was by\r\npainting by a brush dipped into wax liquefied by heat; the colours so\r\napplied attained considerable hardness, and could not be damaged either\r\nby the heat of the sun or by the effects of sea-water. It was thus that\r\nships were decorated; and this kind of encaustic was therefore styled\r\n\"ship-painting.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1749 Count Caylus and J.J. Bachelier, a painter, made\r\nsome experiments in encaustic painting, and the count undertook to\r\nexplain an obscure passage in Pliny, supposed to be the following (xxxv.\r\n39):--\"Ceris pingere ac picturam inurere quis primus excogitaverit non\r\nconstat. Quidam Aristidis inventum putant, postea consummatum a\r\nPraxitele; sed aliquanto vetustiores encausticae picturae exstitere, ut\r\nPolygnoti et Nicanoris et Arcesilai Pariorum. Lysippus quoque Aeginae\r\npicturae suae inscripsit [Greek: enekausen], quod profecto non fecisset\r\nnisi encaustica inventa.\" There are other passages in Pliny bearing upon\r\nthis subject, in one of which (xxi. 49) he gives an account of the\r\npreparation of \"Punica cera.\" The nature of this Punic wax, which was\r\nthe essential ingredient of the ancient painting in encaustic, has not\r\nbeen definitely ascertained. The chevalier Lorgna, who investigated the\r\nsubject in a small but valuable tract, asserts that the _nitron_ which\r\nPliny mentions is not the nitre of the moderns, but the _natron_ of the\r\nancients, viz. the native salt which is found crystallized in Egypt and\r\nother hot countries in sands surrounding lakes of salt water. This\r\nsubstance the Carthaginians, according to Pliny, used in preparing their\r\nwax, and hence the name Punic seems to be derived. Lorgna made a number\r\nof experiments with this salt, using from three to twenty parts of white\r\nmelted wax with one of natron. He held the mixture in an iron vessel\r\nover a slow fire, stirring it gently with a wooden spatula, till the\r\nmass assumed the consistency of butter and the colour of milk. He then\r\nremoved it from the fire, and put it in the shade in the open air to\r\nharden. The wax being cooled liquefied in water, and a milky emulsion\r\nresulted from it like that which could be made with the best Venetian\r\nsoap.\r\n\r\nExperiments, it is said, were made with this wax in painting in\r\nencaustic in the apartments of the Count Giovanni Battista Gasola by the\r\nItalian painter Antonio Paccheri, who dissolved the Punic wax when it\r\nwas not so much hardened as to require to be \"igni resoluta,\" as\r\nexpressed by Pliny, with pure water slightly infused with gum-arabic,\r\ninstead of sarcocolla, mentioned by Pliny. He afterwards mixed the\r\ncolours with this wax so liquefied as he would have done with oil, and\r\nproceeded to paint in the same manner; nor were the colours seen to run\r\nor alter in the least; and the mixture was so flexible that the pencil\r\nran smoother than it would have done with oil. The painting being dry,\r\nhe treated it with caustic, and rubbed it with linen cloths, by which\r\nthe colours acquired peculiar vivacity and brightness.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1755 further experiments were made by Count Caylus and\r\nseveral French artists. One method was to melt wax with oil of\r\nturpentine as a vehicle for the colours. It is well known that wax may\r\nbe dissolved in spirit and used as a medium, but it dries too quickly to\r\nallow of perfect blending, and would by the evaporation of the spirit be\r\nprejudicial to the artist's health. Another method suggested about this\r\ntime, and one which seems to tally very well with Pliny's description,\r\nis the following. Melt the wax with strong solution of salt of tartar,\r\nand let the colours be ground up in it. Place the picture when finished\r\nbefore the fire till by degrees the wax melts, swells, and is bloated up\r\nupon the picture; the picture is then gradually removed from the fire,\r\nand the colours, without being injuriously affected by the operation of\r\nthe fire, become unalterable, spirits of wine having been burnt upon\r\nthem without doing the least harm. Count Caylus's method was different,\r\nand much simpler: (1) the cloth or wood designed for the picture is\r\nwaxed over, by rubbing it simply with a piece of beeswax; (2) the\r\ncolours are mixed up with pure water; but as these colours will not\r\nadhere to the wax, the whole ground must be rubbed over with chalk or\r\nwhiting before the colour is applied; and (3) when the picture is dry it\r\nis put near the fire, whereby the wax is melted and absorbs the colours.\r\nIt must be allowed that nothing could well be simpler than this process,\r\nand it was thought that this kind of painting would be capable of\r\nwithstanding the weather and of lasting longer than oil painting. This\r\nkind of painting has not the gloss of oil painting, so that the picture\r\nmay be seen in any light, a quality of the very first importance in all\r\nmethods of mural painting. The colours too, when so secured, are firm,\r\nand will bear washing, and have a property which is perhaps more\r\nimportant still, viz. that exposure to smoke and foul vapours merely\r\nleaves a deposit on the surface without injuring the work. The \"encausto\r\npingendi\" of the ancients could not have been enamelling, as the word\r\n\"inurere,\" taken in its rigorous sense, might at first lead one to\r\nsuppose, nor could it have been painting produced in the same manner as\r\nencaustic tiles or encaustic tesserae; but that it must have been\r\nsomething akin to the count's process would appear from the words of\r\nPliny already quoted, \"Ceris pingere ac picturam inurere.\"\r\n\r\nWerner of Neustadt found the following process very effectual in making\r\nwax soluble in water. For each pound of white wax he took twenty-four\r\nounces of potash, which he dissolved in two pints of water, warming it\r\ngently. In this ley he boiled the wax, cut into little bits, for half an\r\nhour, after which he removed it from the fire and allowed it to cool.\r\nThe wax floated on the surface of the liquor in the form of a white\r\nsaponaceous matter; and this being triturated with water produced a sort\r\nof emulsion, which he called wax milk, or encaustic wax. This\r\npreparation may be mixed with all kinds of colours, and consequently can\r\nbe applied in a single operation.\r\n\r\nMrs Hooker of Rottingdean, at the end of the 18th century, made many\r\nexperiments to establish a method of painting in wax, and received a\r\ngold palette from the Society of Arts for her investigations in this\r\nbranch of art. Her account is printed in the tenth volume of the\r\nSociety's Transactions (1792), under the name of Miss Emma Jane\r\nGreenland.\r\n\r\n  See also Lorgna, _Un Discorso sulla cera punica_; Pittore Vicenzo\r\n  Requeno, _Saggi sul ristabilimento dell' antica arte de' Greci e\r\n  Romani_ (Parma, 1787); _Phil.

T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENCEINTE (Lat. _in_, within, _cinctus_, girdled; to be distinguished\r\nfrom the word meaning \"pregnant,\" from _in_, not, and _cinctus_, i.e.\r\nwith girdle loosened), a French term used technically in fortification\r\nfor the inner ring of fortifications surrounding a town. Strictly the\r\nterm was applied to the continuous line of bastions and curtains forming\r\nthe \"body of the place,\" this last expression being often used as\r\nsynonymous with _enceinte_. The outworks, however, close to the enceinte\r\nwere not considered as forming part of it. In modern fortification the\r\nenceinte is usually simply the innermost continuous line of\r\nfortifications. In architecture generally an enceinte is the close or\r\nprecinct of a cathedral, abbey, castle, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENCINA, JUAN DEL (1469-c. 1533), often called the founder of the Spanish\r\ndrama, was born in 1469 near Salamanca probably at Encinas. On leaving\r\nthe university of Salamanca he became a member of the household of the\r\nsecond duke of Alva. In 1492 the poet entertained his patron with a\r\ndramatic piece, the _Triunfo de la fama_, written to commemorate the\r\nfall of Granada. In 1496 he published his _Cancionero_, a collection of\r\ndramatic and lyrical poems. Some years afterwards he visited Rome,\r\nattracted the attention of Alexander VI. by his skill in music, and was\r\nappointed choirmaster. About 1518 Encina took orders, and made a\r\npilgrimage to Jerusalem, where he said his first mass. Since 1509 he had\r\nheld a lay canonry at Malaga; in 1519 he was appointed prior of Leon and\r\nis said to have died at Salamanca about 1533. His _Cancionero_ is\r\npreceded by a prose treatise (_Arte de trobar_) on the condition of the\r\npoetic art in Spain. His fourteen dramatic pieces mark the transition\r\nfrom the purely ecclesiastical to the secular stage. The _Aucto del\r\nRepelon_ and the _Egloga de Fileno_ dramatize the adventures of\r\nshepherds; the latter, like _Placida y Vitoriano_, is strongly\r\ninfluenced by the _Celestina_. The intrinsic interest of Encina's plays\r\nis slight, but they are important from the historical point of view, for\r\nthe lay pieces form a new departure, and the devout eclogues prepare the\r\nway for the _autos_ of the 17th century. Moreover, Encina's _lyrical\r\npoems_ are remarkable for their intense sincerity and devout grace.\r\n\r\n  Bibliography.--_Teatro completo de Juan del Encina_ (Madrid, 1893),\r\n  edited by F.

Matriculating at the university of\r\nGottingen in 1811, he began by devoting himself to astronomy under Carl\r\nFriedrich Gauss; but he enlisted in the Hanseatic Legion for the\r\ncampaign of 1813-14, and became lieutenant of artillery in the Prussian\r\nservice in 1815. Having returned to Gottingen in 1816, he was at once\r\nappointed by Benhardt von Lindenau his assistant in the observatory of\r\nSeeberg near Gotha. There he completed his investigation of the comet of\r\n1680, for which the Cotta prize was awarded to him in 1817; he correctly\r\nassigned a period of 71 years to the comet of 1812; and discovered the\r\nswift circulation of the remarkable comet which bears his name (see\r\nComet). Eight masterly treatises on its movements were published by him\r\nin the Berlin _Abhandlungen_ (1829-1859). From a fresh discussion of the\r\ntransits of Venus in 1761 and 1769 he deduced (1822-1824) a solar\r\nparallax of 8\".57, long accepted as authoritative. In 1822 he became\r\ndirector of the Seeberg observatory, and in 1825 was promoted to a\r\ncorresponding position at Berlin, where a new observatory, built under\r\nhis superintendence, was inaugurated in 1835. He directed the\r\npreparation of the star-maps of the Berlin academy 1830-1859, edited\r\nfrom 1830 and greatly improved the _Astronomisches Jahrbuch_, and issued\r\nfour volumes of the _Astronomische Beobachtungen_ of the Berlin\r\nobservatory (1840-1857). Much labour was bestowed by him upon\r\nfacilitating the computation of the movements of the asteroids. With\r\nthis end in view he expounded to the Berlin academy in 1849 a mode of\r\ndetermining an elliptic orbit from three observations, and communicated\r\nto that body in 1851 a new method of calculating planetary perturbations\r\nby means of rectangular co-ordinates (republished in W. Ostwald's\r\n_Klassiker der exacten Wissenschaften_, No. 141, 1903). Encke visited\r\nEngland in 1840. Incipient brain-disease compelled him to withdraw from\r\nofficial life in November 1863, and he died at Spandau on the 26th of\r\nAugust 1865. He contributed extensively to the periodical literature of\r\nastronomy, and was twice, in 1823 and 1830, the recipient of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society's gold medal.\r\n\r\n  See _Johann Franz Encke, sein Leben und Wirken_, von Dr C. Bruhns\r\n  (Leipzig, 1869), to which a list of his writings is appended. Also,\r\n  _Month. Notices Roy. Astr. Society_, xxvi. 129; _V.J.S.

C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENCLAVE (a French word from _enclaver_, to enclose), a term signifying a\r\ncountry or, more commonly, an outlying portion of a country, entirely\r\nsurrounded by the territories of a foreign or other power, such as the\r\ndetached portions of Prussia, Saxony, &c, enclosed in the Thuringian\r\nStates. (From the point of view of the states possessing such detached\r\nportions of territory these become \"exclaves.\") \"Enclave\" is, however,\r\ngenerally used in a looser sense to describe a colony or other territory\r\nof a state, which, while possessing a seaboard, is entirely surrounded\r\nlandward by the possession of some other power; or, if inland territory,\r\nnearly though not entirely so enclosed, e.g. the Lado Enclave in\r\nequatorial Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENCOIGNURE, in furniture, literally the angle, or return, formed by the\r\njunction of two walls. The word is now chiefly used to designate a small\r\narmoire, commode, cabinet or cupboard made to fit a corner; a _chaise\r\nencoignure_ is called in English a three-cornered chair. In its origin\r\nthe thing, like the word, is French, and the delightful Louis Quinze or\r\nLouis Seize _encoignure_ in lacquer or in mahogany elaborately mounted\r\nin gilded bronze is not the least alluring piece of the great period of\r\nFrench furniture. It was made in a vast variety of forms so far as the\r\nfront was concerned; in other respects it was strictly limited by its\r\ndestination. As a rule these delicate and dainty receptacles were in\r\npairs and placed in opposite angles; more often than not the top was\r\nformed of a slab of coloured marble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENCYCLICAL (from Late Lat. _encyclicus_, for _encyclius_ = Gr. [Greek:\r\nenkyklios], from [Greek: en] and [Greek: kyklos], \"a circle\"), an\r\necclesiastical epistle intended for general circulation, now almost\r\nexclusively used of such letters issued by the pope. The forms\r\n_encyclica_ and _encyclic_ are sometimes, but more rarely, used. The old\r\nadjectival use of the word in the sense of \"general\" (encircling) is now\r\nobsolete, though it survives in the term \"encyclopaedia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENCYCLOPAEDIA. The Greeks seem to have understood by encyclopaedia\r\n([Greek: enkyklopaideia], or [Greek: enkyklios paideia]) instruction in\r\nthe whole circle ([Greek: en kyklo]) or complete system of\r\nlearning--education in arts and sciences. Thus Pliny, in the preface to\r\nhis _Natural History_, says that his book treated of all the subjects of\r\nthe encyclopaedia of the Greeks, \"Jam omnia attingenda quae Graeci\r\n[Greek: tes enkyklopaideias] vocant.\" Quintilian (_Inst. Orat_. i. 10)\r\ndirects that before boys are placed under the rhetorician they should be\r\ninstructed in the other arts, \"ut efficiatur orbis ille doctrinae quam\r\nGraeci [Greek: enkyklopaideian] vocant.\" Galen (_De victus ratione in\r\nmorbis acutis_, c. 11) speaks of those who are not educated [Greek: en\r\nte enkyklopaideia]. In these passages of Pliny and Quintilian, however,\r\nfrom one or both of which the modern use of the word seems to have been\r\ntaken, [Greek: enkyklios paideia] is now read, and this seems to have\r\nbeen the usual expression. Vitruvius (lib. vi. praef.) calls the\r\nencyclios or [Greek: enkyklios paideia] of the Greeks \"doctrinarum\r\nomnium disciplina,\" instruction in all branches of learning. Strabo\r\n(lib. iv. cap. 10) speaks of philosophy [Greek: kai ten allen paideian\r\nenkyklion]. Tzetzes (_Chiliades_, xi. 527), quoting from Porphyry's\r\n_Lives of the Philosophers_, says that [Greek: enkyklia mathemata] was\r\nthe circle of grammar, rhetoric, philosophy and the four arts under it,\r\narithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy. Zonaras explains it as\r\ngrammar, poetry, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics and simply every art\r\nand science ([Greek: aplos pasa techne kai episteme]), because sophists\r\ngo through them as through a circle. The idea seems to be a complete\r\ncourse of instruction in all parts of knowledge. An epic poem was called\r\ncyclic when it contained the whole mythology; and among physicians\r\n[Greek: kyklo therapeuein], _cyclo curare_ (Vegetius, _De arte\r\nveterinaria_, ii. 5, 6), meant a cure effected by a regular and\r\nprescribed course of diet and medicine (see Wower, _De polymathia_, c.\r\n24, S 14).\r\n\r\nThe word encyclopaedia was probably first used in English by Sir Thomas\r\nElyot. \"In an oratour is required to be a heape of all maner of lernyng:\r\nwhiche of some is called the worlde of science, of other the circle of\r\ndoctrine, whiche is in one worde of greke Encyclopedia\" (_The\r\nGovernour_, bk. i. chap. xiii.). In his Latin dictionary, 1538, he\r\nexplains \"Encyclios et Encyclia, the cykle or course of all doctrines,\"\r\nand \"Encyclopedia, that lernynge whiche comprehendeth all lyberall\r\nscience and studies.\" The term does not seem to have been used as the\r\ntitle of a book by the ancients or in the middle ages. The edition of\r\nthe works of Joachimus Fortius Ringelbergius, printed at Basel in 1541,\r\nis called on the title-page _Lucubrationes vel potius absolutissima_\r\n[Greek: kyklopaideia]. Paulus Scalichius de Lika, an Hungarian count,\r\nwrote _Encyclopaediae seu orbis disciplinarum epistemon_ (Basileae,\r\n1599, 4to). Alsted published in 1608 _Encyclopaedia cursus\r\nphilosophici_, and afterwards expanded this into his great work, noticed\r\nbelow, calling it without any limitation _Encyclopaedia_, because it\r\ntreats of everything that can be learned by man in this life. This is\r\nnow the most usual sense in which the word encyclopaedia is used--a book\r\ntreating of all the various kinds of knowledge. The form \"cyclopaedia\"\r\nis not merely without any appearance of classical authority, but is\r\netymologically less definite, complete and correct. For as Cyropaedia\r\nmeans \"the instruction of Cyrus,\" so cyclopaedia may mean \"instruction\r\nof a circle.\" Vossius says, \"Cyclopaedia is sometimes found, but the\r\nbest writers say encyclopaedia\" (_De vitiis sermonis_, 1645, p. 402).\r\nGesner says, \"[Greek: kyklos] est _circulus_, quae figura est\r\nsimplicissima et perfectissima simul: nam incipi potest ubicunque in\r\nilla et ubicunque cohaeret. _Cyclopaedia_ itaque significat omnem\r\ndoctrinarum scientiam inter se cohaerere; _Encyclopaedia_ est\r\ninstitutio in illo circulo.\" (_Isagoge_, 1774, i. 40).\r\n\r\nIn a more restricted sense, encyclopaedia means a system or\r\nclassification of the various branches of knowledge, a subject on which\r\nmany books have been published, especially in Germany, as Schmid's\r\n_Allgemeine Encyklopadie und Methodologie der Wissenschaften_ (Jena,\r\n1810, 4to, 241 pages). In this sense the _Novum Organum_ of Bacon has\r\noften been called an encyclopaedia. But it is \"a grammar only of the\r\nsciences: a cyclopaedia is not a grammar, but a dictionary; and to\r\nconfuse the meanings of grammar and dictionary is to lose the benefit of\r\na distinction which it is fortunate that terms have been coined to\r\nconvey\" (_Quarterly Review_, cxiii. 354). Fortunius Licetus, an Italian\r\nphysician, entitled several of his dissertations on Roman altars and\r\nother antiquities encyclopaedias (as, for instance, _Encyclopaedia ad.\r\nAram mysticam Nonarii,_ Pataviae, 1631, 4to), because in composing them\r\nhe borrowed the aid of all the sciences. The _Encyclopaedia moralis_ of\r\nMarcellinus de Pise (Paris, 1646, fol., 4 vols.) is a series of sermons.\r\nEncyclopaedia is often used to mean a book which is, or professes to be,\r\na complete or very full collection or treatise relating to some\r\nparticular subject, as Blaine's work, _The Encyclopaedia of Rural Sports_\r\n(London, 1852); _The Encyclopaedia of Wit_ (London, 1803); _The Vocal\r\nEncyclopaedia_ (London, 1807, 16mo), a collection of songs, catches, &c.\r\nThe word is frequently used for an alphabetical dictionary treating fully\r\nof some science or subject, as Murray, _Encyclopaedia of Geography_\r\n(London, 1834); Lefebvre Laboulaye, _Encyclopedie technologique:\r\nDictionnaire des arts et manufactures_ (Paris, 1845-1847). Whether under\r\nthe name of \"dictionary\" or \"encyclopaedia\" large numbers of this class\r\nof reference-work have been published. These are essentially\r\nencyclopaedic, being _subject books_ and not _word-books_. The important\r\nbooks of this character are referred to in the articles dealing with the\r\nrespective subjects, but the following may be mentioned here: the _Jewish\r\nEncyclopedia_, in 12 vols. (1901), a descriptive record of the history,\r\nreligion, literature and customs of the Jewish people from the earliest\r\ntimes; the _Encyclopaedia of Sport_, 2 vols. (1897-1898); Holtzendorff's\r\n_Encyklopadie der Rechtswissenschaft_ (1870; an edition in 2 vols.,\r\n1904); the _Dictionary of Political Economy_, edited by R.H. Inglis\r\nPalgrave, 3 vols. (1894; reprinted 1901); the Encyclopaedia Biblica,\r\nedited by T.K. Cheyne and J. Sutherland Black, 4 vols. (1899-1903); the\r\n_Dictionary of the Bible_, edited by James Hastings, 4 vols., with a\r\nsupplementary volume (1904); an interesting series is the _Repertoire\r\ngeneral du commerce_, dealing with the foreign trade of France, of which\r\none part, the _Encyclopaedia of Trade between the United States of\r\nAmerica and France_, with a preface by M. Gabriel Hanotaux, appeared, in\r\nFrench and English, in 1904.\r\n\r\nThe great Chinese encyclopaedias are referred to in the article on\r\nCHINESE LITERATURE. It will be sufficient to mention here the _Wen hien\r\nt'ung k'ao_, compiled by Ma Twa-lin in the 14th century, the\r\nencyclopaedia ordered to be compiled by the Emperor Yung-loh in the 15th\r\ncentury, and the _Ku Kin t'u shu thi ch'eng_ prepared for the Emperor\r\nK'ang-hi (d. 1721), in 5020 volumes. A copy of this enormous work, bound\r\nin some 700 volumes, is in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient encyclopaedia extant is Pliny's _Natural History_ in 37\r\nbooks (including the preface) and 2493 chapters, which may be thus\r\ndescribed generally:--book 1, preface; book 2, cosmography, astronomy\r\nand meteorology; books 3 to 6, geography; books 7 to 11, zoology,\r\nincluding man, and the invention of the arts; books 12 to 19, botany;\r\nbooks 20 to 32, medicines, vegetable and animal remedies, medical\r\nauthors and magic; books 33 to 37, metals, fine arts, mineralogy and\r\nmineral remedies. Pliny, who died A.D. 79, was not a naturalist, a\r\nphysician or an artist, and collected his work in his leisure intervals\r\nwhile engaged in public affairs. He says it contains 20,000 facts (too\r\nsmall a number by half, says Lemaire), collected from 2000 books by 100\r\nauthors. Hardouin has given a list of 464 authors quoted by him. His\r\nwork was a very high authority in the middle ages, and 43 editions of it\r\nwere printed before 1536.\r\n\r\nMartianus Minneus Felix Capella, an African, wrote (early in the 5th\r\ncent.), in verse and prose, a sort of encyclopaedia, which is important\r\nfrom having been regarded in the middle ages as a model storehouse of\r\nlearning, and used in the schools, where the scholars had to learn the\r\nverses by heart, as a text-book of high-class education in the arts. It\r\nis sometimes entitled _Satyra_, or _Satyricon_, but is usually known as\r\n_De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii_, though this title is sometimes\r\nconfined to the first two books, a rather confused allegory ending with\r\nthe apotheosis of Philologia and the celebration of her marriage in the\r\nmilky way, where Apollo presents to her the seven liberal arts, who, in\r\nthe succeeding seven books, describe their respective branches of\r\nknowledge, namely, grammar, dialectics (divided into metaphysics and\r\nlogic), rhetoric, geometry (geography, with some single geometrical\r\npropositions), arithmetic (chiefly the properties of numbers), astronomy\r\nand music (including poetry). The style is that of an African of the 5th\r\ncentury, full of grandiloquence, metaphors and strange words. He seldom\r\nmentions his authorities, and sometimes quotes authors whom he does not\r\neven seem to have read. His work was frequently copied in the middle\r\nages by ignorant transcribers, and was eight times printed from 1499 to\r\n1599. The best annotated edition is by Kopp (Frankfort, 1836, 4to), and\r\nthe most convenient and the best text is that of Eysserhardt (Lipsiae,\r\n1866, 8vo).\r\n\r\nIsidore, bishop of Seville from 600 to 630, wrote _Etymologiarum libri\r\nXX_. (often also entitled his _Origines_) at the request of his friend\r\nBraulio, bishop of Saragossa, who after Isidore's death divided the work\r\ninto books, as it was left unfinished, and divided only into titles.\r\n\r\n  The tenth book is an alphabet of 625 Latin words, not belonging to his\r\n  other subjects, with their explanations as known to him, and often\r\n  with their etymologies, frequently very absurd. The other books\r\n  contain 448 chapters, and are:--1, grammar (Latin); 2, rhetoric and\r\n  dialectics; 3, the four mathematical disciplines--arithmetic,\r\n  geometry, music and astronomy; 4, medicine; 5, laws and times\r\n  (chronology), with a short chronicle ending in 627; 6, ecclesiastical\r\n  books and offices; 7, God, angels and the orders of the faithful; 8,\r\n  the church and sects; 9, languages, society and relationships; 11, man\r\n  and portents; 12, animals, in eight classes, namely, pecora et\r\n  jumenta, beasts, small animals (including spiders, crickets and ants),\r\n  serpents, worms, fishes, birds and small winged creatures, chiefly\r\n  insects; 13, the world and its parts; 14, the earth and its parts,\r\n  containing chapters on Asia, Europe and Libya, that is, Africa; 15,\r\n  buildings, fields and their measures; 16, stones (of which one is\r\n  echo) and metals; 17, de rebus rusticis; 18, war and games; 19, ships,\r\n  buildings and garments; 20, provisions, domestic and rustic\r\n  instruments.\r\n\r\nIsidore appears to have known Hebrew and Greek, and to have been\r\nfamiliar with the Latin classical poets, but he is a mere collector, and\r\nhis derivations given all through the work are not unfrequently absurd,\r\nand, unless when very obvious, will not bear criticism. He seldom\r\nmentions his authorities except when he quotes the poets or historians.\r\nYet his work was a great one for the time, and for many centuries was a\r\nmuch valued authority and a rich source of material for other works, and\r\nhe had a high reputation for learning both in his own time and in\r\nsubsequent ages. His _Etymologies_ were often imitated, quoted and\r\ncopied. MSS. are very numerous: Antonio (whose editor, Bayer, saw nearly\r\n40) says, \"plures passimque reperiuntur in bibliothecarum angulis.\" This\r\nwork was printed nine times before 1529.\r\n\r\nHrabanus Maurus, whose family name was Magnentius, was educated in the\r\nabbey of Fulda, ordained deacon in 802 (\"Annales Francorum\" in Bouquet,\r\n_Historiens de la France_, v. 66), sent to the school of St Martin of\r\nTours, then directed by Alcuin, where he seems to have learned Greek,\r\nand is said by Trithemius to have been taught Hebrew, Syriac and Chaldee\r\nby Theophilus an Ephesian. In his _Commentaries on Joshua_ (lib. ii. c.\r\n5) he speaks of having resided at Sidon. He returned to Fulda and taught\r\nthe school there. He became abbot of Fulda in 822, resigned in April\r\n842, was ordained archbishop of Mainz on the 26th of July 847, and died\r\non the 4th of February 856. He compiled an encyclopaedia _De universo_\r\n(also called in some MSS. _De universali natura, De natura rerum,_ and\r\n_De origine rerum_) in 22 books and 325 chapters. It is chiefly a\r\nrearrangement of Isidore's _Etymologies_, omitting the first four\r\nbooks, half of the fifth and the tenth (the seven liberal arts, law,\r\nmedicine and the alphabet of words), and copying the rest, beginning\r\nwith the seventh book, verbally, though with great omissions, and adding\r\n(according to Ritter, _Geschichte der Philosophie_, vii. 193, from\r\nAlcuin, Augustine or some other accessible source) the meanings given in\r\nthe Bible to the subject matter of the chapter; while things not\r\nmentioned in Scripture, especially such as belong to classical\r\nantiquity, are omitted, so that his work seems to be formed of two\r\nalternating parts. His arrangement of beginning with God and the angels\r\nlong prevailed in methodical encyclopaedias. His last six books follow\r\nvery closely the order of the last five of Isidore, from which they are\r\ntaken. His omissions are characteristic of the diminished literary\r\nactivity and more contracted knowledge of his time. His work was\r\npresented to Louis the German, king of Bavaria, at Hersfeld in October\r\n847, and was printed in 1473, fol., probably at Venice, and again at\r\nStrassburg by Mentelin about 1472-1475, fol., 334 pages.\r\n\r\nMichael Constantine Psellus, the younger, wrote [Greek: Didaskalia\r\npantodape], dedicated to the emperor Michael Ducas, who reigned\r\n1071-1078. It was printed by Fabricius in his _Bibliotheca Graeca_\r\n(1712), vol. v., in 186 pages 4to and 193 chapters, each containing a\r\nquestion and answer. Beginning with divinity, it goes on through natural\r\nhistory and astronomy, and ends with chapters on excessive hunger, and\r\nwhy flesh hung from a fig-tree becomes tender. As collation with a Turin\r\nMS. showed that 35 chapters were wanting, Harles has omitted the text in\r\nhis edition of Fabricius, and gives only the titles of the chapters (x.\r\n84-88).\r\n\r\nThe author of the most famous encyclopaedia of the middle ages was\r\nVincent (q.v.) of Beauvais (c. 1190-c. 1264), whose work _Bibliotheca\r\nmundi_ or _Speculum majus_--divided, as we have it, into four parts,\r\n_Speculum naturale_, _Speculum doctrinale_, _Speculum morale_ (this part\r\nshould be ascribed to a later hand), and _Speculum historiale_--was the\r\ngreat compendium of mid-13th century knowledge. Vincent of Beauvais\r\npreserved several works of the middle ages and gives extracts from many\r\nlost classics and valuable readings of others, and did more than any\r\nother medieval writer to awaken a taste for classical literature.\r\nFabricius (_Bibl. Graeca_, 1728, xiv. pp. 107-125) has given a list of\r\n328 authors, Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and Latin, quoted in the _Speculum\r\nnaturale_. To these should be added about 100 more for the _doctrinale_\r\nand _historiale_. As Vincent did not know Greek or Arabic, he used Latin\r\ntranslations. This work is dealt with separately in the article on\r\nVINCENT OF BEAUVAIS.\r\n\r\nBrunetto Latini of Florence (born 1230, died 1294), the master of Dante\r\nand Guido Cavalcanti, while an exile in France between 1260 and 1267,\r\nwrote in French _Li Livres dou Tresor_, in 3 books and 413 chapters.\r\nBook i. contains the origin of the world, the history of the Bible and\r\nof the foundation of governments, astronomy, geography, and lastly\r\nnatural history, taken from Aristotle, Pliny, and the old French\r\nBestiaries. The first part of Book ii., on morality, is from the\r\n_Ethics_ of Aristotle, which Brunetto had translated into Italian. The\r\nsecond part is little more than a copy of the well-known collection of\r\nextracts from ancient and modern moralists, called the _Moralities of\r\nthe Philosophers_, of which there are many MSS. in prose and verse. Book\r\niii., on politics, begins with a treatise on rhetoric, chiefly from\r\nCicero _De inventione_, with many extracts from other writers and\r\nBrunetto's remarks. The last part, the most original and interesting of\r\nall, treats of the government of the Italian republics of the time. Like\r\nmany of his contemporaries, Brunetto revised his work, so that there are\r\ntwo editions, the second made after his return from exile. MSS. are\r\nsingularly numerous, and exist in all the dialects then used in France.\r\nOthers were written in Italy. It was translated into Italian in the\r\nlatter part of the 13th century by Bono Giamboni, and was printed at\r\nTrevigi, 1474, fol., Venice, 1528 and 1533. The _Tesoro_ of Brunetto\r\nmust not be confounded with his _Tesoretto_, an Italian poem of 2937\r\nshort lines. Napoleon I. had intended to have the French text of the\r\n_Tesoro_ printed with commentaries, and appointed a commission for the\r\npurpose. It was at last published in the _Collection des documents\r\ninedits_ (Paris, 1863, 4to, 772 pages), edited by Chabaille from 42 MSS.\r\n\r\nBartholomew de Glanville, an English Franciscan friar, wrote about 1360\r\na most popular work, _De proprietatibus rerum_, in 19 books and 1230\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n  Book 1 relates to God; 2, angels; 3, the soul; 4, the substance of the\r\n  body; 5, anatomy; 6, ages; 7, diseases; 8, the heavens (astronomy and\r\n  astrology); 9, time; 10, matter and form; 11, air; 12, birds\r\n  (including insects, 38 names, Aquila to Vespertilio); 13, water (with\r\n  fishes); 14, the earth (42 mountains, Ararath to Ziph); 15, provinces\r\n  (171 countries, Asia to Zeugia); 16, precious stones (including coral,\r\n  pearl, salt, 104 names, Arena to Zinguttes); 17, trees and herbs (197,\r\n  Arbor to Zucarum); 18, animals (114, Aries to Vipera); 19, colours,\r\n  scents, flavours and liquors, with a list of 36 eggs (Aspis to\r\n  Vultur). Some editions add book 20, accidents of things, that is,\r\n  numbers, measures, weights and sounds. The Paris edition of 1574 has a\r\n  book on bees.\r\n\r\nThere were 15 editions before 1500. An English translation was completed\r\n11th February 1398 by John Trevisa, and printed by Wynkyn de Worde,\r\nWestminster, 1495? fol.; London, 1533, fol.; and with considerable\r\nadditions by Stephen Batman, a physician, London, 1582, fol. It was\r\ntranslated into French by Jehan Corbichon at the command of Charles V.\r\nof France, and printed 14 times from 1482 to 1556. A Dutch translation\r\nwas printed in 1479, and again at Haarlem, 1485, fol.; and a Spanish\r\ntranslation by Padre Vincente de Burgos, Tholosa, 1494, fol.\r\n\r\nPierre Bersuire (Berchorius), a Benedictine, prior of the abbey of St\r\nEloi in Paris, where he died in 1362, wrote a kind of encyclopaedia,\r\nchiefly relating to divinity, in three parts:--_Reductorium morale super\r\ntotam Bibliam_, 428 _moralitates_ in 34 books on the Bible from Genesis\r\nto Apocalypse; _Reductorium morale de proprietatibus rerum_, in 14 books\r\nand 958 chapters, a methodical encyclopaedia or system of nature on the\r\nplan of Bartholomew de Glanville, and chiefly taken from him (Berchorius\r\nplaces animals next after fishes in books 9 and 10, and adopts as\r\nnatural classes _volatilia_, _natatilia_ and _gressibilia_);\r\n_Dictionarius_, an alphabetical dictionary of 3514 words used in the\r\nBible with moral expositions, occupying in the last edition 1558 folio\r\npages. The first part was printed 11 times from 1474 to 1515, and the\r\nthird 4 times. The three parts were printed together as _Petri Berchorii\r\nopera omnia_ (an incorrect title, for he wrote much besides), Moguntiae,\r\n1609, fol., 3 vols., 2719 pages; Coloniae Agrippinae, 1631, fol., 3\r\nvols.; _ib._ 1730-1731, fol., 6 vols., 2570 pages.\r\n\r\nA very popular small encyclopaedia, _Margarita philosophica_, in 12\r\nbooks, divided into 26 tractates and 573 chapters, was written by Georg\r\nReisch, a German, prior of the Carthusians of Freiburg, and confessor of\r\nthe emperor Maximilian I. Books 1-7 treat of the seven liberal arts; 8,\r\n9, principles and origin of natural things; 10, 11, the soul,\r\nvegetative, sensitive and intellectual; 12, moral philosophy. The first\r\nedition, Heidelberg, 1496, 4to, was followed by 8 others to 1535. An\r\nItalian translation by the astronomer Giovanno Paolo Gallucci was\r\npublished at Venice in 1594, 1138 small quarto pages, of which 343\r\nconsist of additional tracts appended by the translator.\r\n\r\nRaphael Maffei, called Volaterranus, being a native of Volterra, where\r\nhe was born in 1451 and died 5th January 1522, wrote _Commentarii\r\nUrbani_ (Rome, 1506, fol., in 38 books), so called because written at\r\nRome. This encyclopaedia, printed eight times up to 1603, is remarkable\r\nfor the great importance given to geography, and also to biography, a\r\nsubject not included in previous encyclopaedias. Indeed, the book is\r\nformed of three nearly equal parts,--geographia, 11 books; anthropologia\r\n(biography), 11 books; and philologia, 15 books. The books are not\r\ndivided into short chapters in the ancient manner, like those of its\r\npredecessors. The edition of 1603 contains 814 folio pages. The first\r\nbook consists of the table of contents and a classed index; books 2-12,\r\ngeography; 13-23, lives of illustrious men, the popes occupying book 22,\r\nand the emperors book 23; 24-27, animals and plants; 28, metals, gems,\r\nstones, houses and other inanimate things; 34, de scientiis cyclicis\r\n(grammar and rhetoric); 35, de scientiis mathematicis, arithmetic,\r\ngeometry, optica, catoptrica, astronomy and astrology; 36-38,\r\nAristotelica (on the works of Aristotle).\r\n\r\nGiorgio Valla, born about 1430 at Placentia, and therefore called\r\nPlacentinus, died at Venice in 1499 while lecturing on the immortality\r\nof the soul. Aldus published his work, edited by his son Giovanni Pietro\r\nValla, _De expetendis et fugiendis rebus_, Venetiis, 1501, fol. 2 vols.\r\n\r\n  It contains 49 books and 2119 chapters. Book 1 is introductory, on\r\n  knowledge, philosophy and mathematics, considered generally (he\r\n  divides everything to be sought or avoided into three kinds--those\r\n  which are in the mind, in the body by nature or habit, and thirdly,\r\n  external, coming from without); books 2-4, arithmetic; 5-9, music;\r\n  10-15, geometry, including Euclid and mechanics--book 15 being in\r\n  three long chapters--de spiritualibus, that is, pneumatics and\r\n  hydraulics, de catoptricis, and de optice; 16-19, astrology (with the\r\n  structure and use of the astrolabe); 20-23, physics (including\r\n  metaphysics); 24-30, medicine; 31-34, grammar; 35-37, dialectics; 38,\r\n  poetry; 39, 40, rhetoric; 41, moral philosophy; 42-44, economics; 45,\r\n  politics; 46-48, de corporis commodis et incommodis, on the good and\r\n  evil of the body (and soul); 49, de rebus externis, as glory,\r\n  grandeur, &c.\r\n\r\nAntonio Zara, born 1574, made bishop of Petina in Istria 1600, finished\r\non the 17th of January 1614 a work published as _Anatomia ingeniorum et\r\nscientiarum_, Venetiis, 1615, 4to, 664 pages, in four sections and 54\r\nmembra. The first section, on the dignity and excellence of man, in 16\r\nmembra, considers him in all his bodily and mental aspects. The first\r\nmembrum describes his structure and his soul, and in the latter part\r\ncontains the author's preface, the deeds of his ancestors, an account of\r\nhimself, and the dedication of his book to Ferdinand, archduke of\r\nAustria. Four membra treat of the discovery of character by chiromancy,\r\nphysiognomy, dreams and astrology. The second section treats of 16\r\nsciences of the imagination--writing, magic, poetry, oratory,\r\ncourtiership (aulicitas), theoretical and mystic arithmetic, geometry,\r\narchitecture, optics, cosmography, astrology, practical medicine, war,\r\ngovernment. The third section treats of 8 sciences of intellect--logic,\r\nphysics, metaphysics, theoretical medicine, ethics, practical\r\njurisprudence, judicature, theoretical theology. The fourth section\r\ntreats of 12 sciences of memory--grammar, practical arithmetic, human\r\nhistory, sacred canons, practical theology, sacred history, and lastly\r\nthe creation and the final catastrophe. The book, now very rare, is well\r\narranged, with a copious index, and is full of curious learning.\r\n\r\nJohann Heinrich Alsted, born 1588, died 1638, published _Encyclopaedia\r\nseptem tomis distincta_, Herbornae Nassoviorum, 1630, fol. 7 vols., 2543\r\npages of very small type. It is in 35 books, divided into 7 classes,\r\npreceded by 48 synoptical tables of the whole, and followed by an index\r\nof 119 pages.\r\n\r\n  I. Praecognita disciplinarum, 4 books, hexilogia, technologia,\r\n  archelogia, didactica, that is, on intellectual habits and on the\r\n  classification, origin and study of the arts. II. Philology, 6 books,\r\n  lexica, grammar, rhetoric, logic, oratory and poetry; book 5, lexica,\r\n  contains dictionaries explained in Latin of 1076 Hebrew, 842 Syriac,\r\n  1934 Arabic, 1923 Greek and 2092 Latin words, and also nomenclator\r\n  technologiae, &c., a classified vocabulary of terms used in the arts\r\n  and sciences, in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, filling 34 pages; book 6\r\n  contains Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, Latin and German grammars; book 10,\r\n  poetica, contains a list of 61 Rotwelsch words. III. Theoretic\r\n  philosophy, 10 books:--book 11, metaphysics; 12, pneumatics (on\r\n  spirits); 13, physics; 14, arithmetic; 15, geometry; 16, cosmography;\r\n  17, uranometria (astronomy and astrology); 18, geography (with maps of\r\n  the Old World, eastern Mediterranean, and Palestine under the Old and\r\n  New Testaments, and a plate of Noah's ark); 19, optics; 20, music. IV.\r\n  Practical philosophy, 4 books:--21, ethics; 22, economics (on\r\n  relationships); 23, politics, with florilegium politicum, 119 pages of\r\n  extracts from historians, philosophers and orators; 24, scholastics\r\n  (on education, with a florilegium of 25 pages). V. The three superior\r\n  faculties:--25, theology; 26, jurisprudence; 27, medicine (ending with\r\n  the rules of the Salernian school). VI. Mechanical arts in\r\n  general:--book 28, mathematical mechanical arts; book 29, agriculture,\r\n  gardening, care of animals, baking, brewing, preparing medicines,\r\n  metallurgy (with mining); book 30, physical mechanical arts--printing,\r\n  dialling, &c. Under paedutica (games) is Vida's Latin poem on chess,\r\n  and one by Leuschner on the ludus Lorzius. VII. Farragines\r\n  disciplinarum, 5 books:--31, mnemonics; 32, history; 33, chronology;\r\n  34, architecture; 35, quodlibetica, miscellaneous arts, as magic,\r\n  cabbala, alchemy, magnetism, &c., with others apparently distinguished\r\n  and named by himself, as, paradoxologia, the art of explaining\r\n  paradoxes; dipnosophistica, the art of philosophizing while feasting;\r\n  cyclognomica, the art of conversing well de quovis scibili;\r\n  tabacologia, the nature, use and abuse of tobacco, &c.--in all 35\r\n  articles in this book.\r\n\r\nAlsted's encyclopaedia was received with very great applause, and was\r\nhighly valued. Lami (_Entretiens_, 1684, p. 188) thought it almost the\r\nonly encyclopaedia which did not deserve to be despised. Alsted's\r\nlearning was very various, and his reading was very extensive and\r\ndiversified. He gives few references, and Thomasius charges him with\r\nplagiarism, as he often copies literally without any acknowledgment. He\r\nwrote not long before the appearance of encyclopaedias in modern\r\nlanguages superseded his own and other Latin books, and but a short time\r\nbefore the alphabetical arrangement began to prevail over the\r\nmethodical. His book was reprinted, Lugduni, 1649, fol. 4 vols., 2608\r\npages.\r\n\r\nJean de Magnon, historiographer to the king of France, undertook to\r\nwrite an encyclopaedia in French heroic verse, which was to fill ten\r\nvolumes of 20,000 lines each, and to render libraries merely a useless\r\nornament. But he did not live to finish it, as he was killed at night by\r\nrobbers on the Pont Neuf in Paris, in April 1662. The part he left was\r\nprinted as _La Science universelle_, Paris, 1663, fol., 348 pages,--10\r\nbooks containing about 11,000 lines. They begin with the nature of God,\r\nand end with the history of the fall of man. His verses, say Chaudon and\r\nDelandine, are perhaps the most nerveless, incorrect, obscure and flat\r\nin French poetry; yet the author had been the friend of Moliere, and had\r\nacted with him in comedy.\r\n\r\nLouis Moreri (born on the 25th of March 1643 at Bargemont, in the\r\ndiocese of Frejus, died on the 10th of July 1680 at Paris) wrote a\r\ndictionary of history, genealogy and biography, _Le Grand Dictionnaire\r\nhistorique, ou le melange curieux de l'histoire sacree et profane_,\r\nLyons, 1674, fol. He began a second edition on a larger scale, published\r\nat Lyons in 1681, in two volumes folio; the sixth edition was edited by\r\nJean le Clerc, Amsterdam, 1691, fol. 4 vols.; the twentieth and last\r\nedition, Paris, 1759, fol. 10 vols. Moreri's dictionary, still very\r\nuseful, was of great value and importance, although not the first of the\r\nkind. It superseded the very inferior compilation of Juigne-Broissinere,\r\n_Dictionnaire theologique_, _historique_, _poetique_, _cosmographique_,\r\n_et chronologique_, Paris, 1644, 4to; Rouen, 1668, &c.,--a translation,\r\nwith additions, of the _Dictionarium historicum_, _geographicum_, _et\r\npoeticum_ of Charles Estienne, published in 1553, 4to, and often\r\nafterwards. As such a work was much wanted, Juigne's book went through\r\ntwelve editions in less than thirty years, notwithstanding its want of\r\ncriticism, errors, anachronisms, defects and inferior style.\r\n\r\nJohann Jacob Hofmann (born on the 11th of September 1635, died on the 10th\r\nof March 1706), son of a schoolmaster at Basel, which he is said never to\r\nhave left, and where he was professor of Greek and History, wrote _Lexicon\r\nuniversale historico-geographico-chronologico-poetico-philologicum_,\r\nBasileae, 1677, fol. 2 vols., 1823 pages, a dictionary of history,\r\nbiography, geography, genealogies of princely families, chronology,\r\nmythology and philology. At the end is Nomenclator [Greek: Mixoglottos],\r\nan index of names of places, people, &c., in many languages, carefully\r\ncollected, and explained in Latin, filling 110 pages; with an index of\r\nsubjects not forming separate articles, occupying 34 pages. In 1683 he\r\npublished a continuation in 2 vols. fol., 2293 pages, containing, besides\r\nadditions to the subjects given in his lexicon, the history of animals,\r\nplants, stones, metals, elements, stars, and especially of man and his\r\naffairs, arts, honours, laws, magic, music, rites and a vast number of\r\nother subjects. In 1698 he published a second edition, Lugduni Batavorum,\r\nfol. 4 vols., 3742 pages, incorporating the continuation with additions.\r\nFrom the great extent of his plan, many articles, especially in history,\r\nare superficial and faulty.\r\n\r\nEtienne Chauvin was born at Nismes on the 18th of April 1640. He fled to\r\nRotterdam on the revocation of the edict of Nantes, and in 1688 supplied\r\nBayle's place in his lectures on philosophy. In 1695 he was invited by\r\nthe elector of Brandenburg to go as professor of philosophy to Berlin,\r\nwhere he became the representative of the Cartesian philosophy, and died\r\non the 6th of April 1725. He wrote _Lexicon rationale_, _sive thesaurus\r\nphilosophicus ordine alphabetico digestus_, Rotterdami, 1692, fol., 746\r\npages and 30 plates. An improved and enlarged edition was printed as\r\n_Lexicon philosophicum secundis curis_, Leovardiae, 1713, large folio,\r\n725 pages and 30 plates. This great work may be considered as a\r\ndictionary of the Cartesian philosophy, and was very much used by\r\nBrucker and other earlier historians of philosophy. It is written in a\r\nvery dry and scholastic style, and seldom names authorities.\r\n\r\nThe great dictionary of French, begun by the French Academy on the 7th\r\nof February 1639, excluded all words especially belonging to science and\r\nthe arts. But the success of the rival dictionary of Furetiere, which,\r\nas its title-page, as well as that of the Essais published in 1684,\r\nconspicuously announced, professed to give \"les termes de toutes les\r\nSciences et des Arts,\" induced Thomas Corneille, a member of the\r\nAcademy, to compile _Le Dictionnaire des arts et des sciences_, which\r\nthe Academy published with the first edition of their dictionary, Paris,\r\n1694, folio, as a supplement in two volumes containing 1236 pages. It\r\nwas reprinted at Amsterdam, 1696, fol. 2 vols., and at Paris in 1720,\r\nand again in 1732, revised by Fontenelle. A long series of dictionaries\r\nof arts and sciences have followed Corneille in placing in their titles\r\nthe arts before the sciences, which he probably did merely in order to\r\ndiffer from Furetiere. Corneille professed to quote no author whom he\r\nhad not consulted; to take plants from Dioscorides and Matthiolus,\r\nmedicine from Ettmuller, chemistry from a MS. of Perrault, and\r\narchitecture, painting and sculpture from Felibien; and to give an\r\nabridged history of animals, birds and fishes, and an account of all\r\nreligious and military orders and their statutes, heresiarchs and\r\nheresies, and dignities and charges ancient and modern.\r\n\r\nPierre Bayle (born on the 18th of November 1647, died on the 28th of\r\nDecember 1706) wrote a very important and valuable work, _Dictionnaire\r\nhistorique et critique_, Rotterdam, 1697, fol. 2 vols. His design was to\r\nmake a dictionary of the errors and omissions of Moreri and others, but\r\nhe was much embarrassed by the numerous editions and supplements of\r\nMoreri. A second edition with an additional volume appeared at Amsterdam\r\nin 1702, fol. 3 vols. The fourth edition, Rotterdam, 1720, fol. 4 vols.,\r\nwas much enlarged from his manuscripts, and was edited by Prosper\r\nMarchand. It contains 3132 pages besides tables, &c. The ninth edition\r\nwas published at Basel, 1741, fol. 10 vols. It was translated into\r\nEnglish from the second edition, London, 1709, fol. 4 vols., with some\r\nslight additions and corrections by the author; and again from the fifth\r\nedition of 1730 by Birch and Lockman, London, 1734-1740, fol. 5 vols.\r\nJ.G. de Chaufepie published _Nouveau Dictionnaire historique_,\r\nAmsterdam, 1750-1756, fol. 4 vols., as a supplement to Bayle. It chiefly\r\nconsists of the articles added by the English translators with many\r\ncorrections and additions, and about 500 new articles added by himself,\r\nand contains in all about 1400 articles. Prosper Marchand, editor of the\r\nfourth edition, left at his death on the 14th of January 1756 materials\r\nfor a supplementary _Dictionnaire historique_, La Haye, 1758, fol. 2\r\nvols., 891 pages, 136 articles. It had occupied his leisure moments for\r\nforty years. Much of his work was written on small scraps of paper,\r\nsometimes 20 in half a page and no larger than a nail, in such small\r\ncharacters that not only the editor but the printer had to use powerful\r\nmagnifiers. Bayle's dictionary was also translated into German, Leipzig,\r\n1741-1744, fol. 4 vols., with a preface by J.C. Gottsched. It is still a\r\nwork of great importance and value.\r\n\r\nVincenzo Maria Coronelli, a Franciscan friar, who was born in Venice\r\nabout 1650, made cosmographer to the republic in 1685, became general of\r\nhis order in 1702, and was found dead at his study table on the 9th of\r\nDecember 1718, began in 1701 to publish a general alphabetical\r\nencyclopaedia, written in Italian, at which he had been working for\r\nthirty years, _Biblioteca universale sacro-profana_. It was to explain\r\nmore than 300,000 words, to include history and biography as well as all\r\nother subjects, and to extend to 45 volumes folio. Volumes 1-39 were to\r\ncontain the dictionary A to Z; 40, 41, the supplement; 42, retractations\r\nand corrections; 43, universal index; 44, index divided into matters;\r\n45, index in various languages. But seven volumes only were published,\r\nVenezia, 1701-1706, fol., 5609 pages, A to Caque. The first six volumes\r\nhave each an index of from 28 to 48 pages (in all 224 pages) of\r\nsubjects, whether forming articles or incidental. The articles in each\r\nare numbered, and amount to 30,269 in the six volumes, which complete\r\nthe letter B. On an average 3 pages contain 22 articles. Each volume is\r\ndedicated to a different patron--the pope, the doge, the king of Spain,\r\n&c. This work is remarkable for the extent and completeness of its plan,\r\nand for being the first great alphabetical encyclopaedia, as well as for\r\nbeing written in a modern language, but it was hastily written and very\r\nincorrect. Never, perhaps, says Tiraboschi (_Storia della letteratura\r\nitaliana_, viii. 546), was there so quick a writer; he composed a folio\r\nvolume as easily as others would a page, but he never perfected his\r\nworks, and what we have of this book will not induce us to regret the\r\nwant of the remainder.\r\n\r\nThe first alphabetical encyclopaedia written in English was the work of\r\na London clergyman, John Harris (born about 1667, elected first\r\nsecretary of the Royal Society on the 30th of November 1709, died on the\r\n7th of September 1719), _Lexicon technicum_, _or an universal English\r\nDictionary of Arts and Sciences_, London, 1704, fol., 1220 pages, 4\r\nplates, with many diagrams and figures printed in the text. Like many\r\nsubsequent English encyclopaedias the pages are not numbered. It\r\nprofesses not merely to explain the terms used in the arts and sciences,\r\nbut the arts and sciences themselves. The author complains that he found\r\nmuch less help from previous dictionaries than one would suppose, that\r\nChauvin is full of obsolete school terms, and Corneille gives only bare\r\nexplanations of terms, which often relate only to simple ideas and\r\ncommon things. He omits theology, antiquity, biography and poetry; gives\r\nonly technical history, geography and chronology; and in logic,\r\nmetaphysics, ethics, grammar and rhetoric, merely explains the terms\r\nused. In mathematics and anatomy he professes to be very full, but says\r\nthat the catalogues and places of the stars are very imperfect, as\r\nFlamsteed refused to assist him. In botany he gave from Ray, Morrison\r\nand Tournefort \"a pretty exact botanick lexicon, which was what we\r\nreally wanted before,\" with an account of all the \"kinds and\r\nsubalternate species of plants, and their specific differences\" on Ray's\r\nmethod. He gave a table of fossils from Dr Woodward, professor of\r\nmedicine in Gresham College, and took great pains to describe the parts\r\nof a ship accurately and particularly, going often on board himself for\r\nthe purpose. In law he abridged from the best writers what he thought\r\nnecessary. He meant to have given at the end an alphabet for each art\r\nand science, and some more plates of anatomy and ships, \"but the\r\nundertaker could not afford it at the price.\" A review of his work,\r\nextending to the unusual length of four pages, appeared in the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_, 1704, p. 1699. This volume was reprinted\r\nin 1708. A second volume of 1419 pages and 4 plates appeared in 1710,\r\nwith a list of about 1300 subscribers. Great part of it consisted of\r\nmathematical and astronomical tables, as he intended his work to serve\r\nas a small mathematical library. He was allowed by Sir Isaac Newton to\r\nprint his treatise on acids. He gives a table of logarithms to seven\r\nfigures of decimals (44 pages), and one of sines, tangents and secants\r\n(120 pages), a list of books filling two pages, and an index of the\r\narticles in both volumes under 26 heads, filling 50 pages. The longest\r\nlists are law (1700 articles), chyrurgery, anatomy, geometry,\r\nfortification, botany and music. The mathematical and physical part is\r\nconsidered very able. He often mentions his authorities, and gives lists\r\nof books on particular subjects, as botany and chronology. His\r\ndictionary was long very popular. The fifth edition was published in\r\n1736, fol. 2 vols. A supplement, including no new subjects, appeared in\r\n1744, London, fol., 996 pages, 6 plates. It was intended to rival\r\nEphraim Chambers's work (see below), but, being considered a\r\nbookseller's speculation, was not well received.\r\n\r\nJohann Hubner, rector of the Johanneum in Hamburg, born on the 17th of\r\nMarch 1668, wrote prefaces to two dictionaries written in German, which\r\nbore his name, and were long popular. The first was _Reales Staats\r\nZeitungs- und Conversations-Lexicon_, Leipzig, 1704, 8vo; second edition,\r\n1706, 947 pages; at the end a register of arms, and indexes of Latin and\r\nFrench words; fifth edition, 1711; fifteenth edition 1735, 1119 pages.\r\nThe thirty-first edition was edited and enlarged by F.A. Ruder, and\r\npublished by Brockhaus, Leipzig, 1824-1828, 8vo, 4 vols., 3088 pages. It\r\nwas translated into Hungarian by Fejer, Pesten, 1816, 8vo, 5 vols., 2958\r\npages. The second, published as a supplement, was _Curieuses und reales\r\nNatur- Kunst- Berg- Gewerb- und Handlungs-Lexicon_, Leipzig, 1712, 8vo,\r\n788 pages, frequently reprinted to 1792. The first relates to the\r\npolitical state of the world, as religion, orders, states, rivers, towns,\r\ncastles, mountains, genealogy, war, ships; the second to nature, science,\r\nart and commerce. They were the work of many authors, of whom Paul Jacob\r\nMarpurger, a celebrated and voluminous writer on trade and commerce, born\r\nat Nuremberg on the 27th of June 1656, was an extensive contributor, and\r\nis the only one named by Hubner.\r\n\r\nJohann Theodor Jablonski, who was born at Danzig on the 15th of December\r\n1654, appointed secretary to the newly founded Prussian Academy in 1700,\r\nwhen he went to Berlin, where he died on the 28th of April 1731,\r\npublished _Allgemeines Lexicon der Kunste und Wissenschaften_, Leipzig,\r\n1721, 4to, a short but excellent encyclopaedia still valued in Germany.\r\nIt does not include theology, history, geography, biography and\r\ngenealogy. He not only names his authorities, but gives a list of their\r\nworks. A new edition in 1748 was increased one-third to 1508 pages. An\r\nimproved edition, Konigsberg and Leipzig, 1767, 4to, 2 vols., 1852\r\npages, was edited by J.J. Schwabe, public teacher of philosophy at\r\nLeipzig.\r\n\r\nEphraim Chambers (q.v.) published his _Cyclopaedia; or an Universal\r\nDictionary of Art and Sciences_, _containing an Explication of the Terms\r\nand an Account of the Things Signified thereby in the several Arts_,\r\n_Liberal and Mechanical_, _and the several Sciences_, _Human and\r\nDivine_, London, 1728, fol. 2 vols. The dedication to the king is dated\r\nOctober 15, 1727. Chambers endeavoured to connect the scattered articles\r\nrelating to each subject by a system of references, and to consider \"the\r\nseveral matters, not only in themselves, but relatively, or as they\r\nrespect each other; both to treat them as so many wholes and as so many\r\nparts of some greater whole.\" Under each article he refers to the\r\nsubject to which it belongs, and also to its subordinate parts; thus\r\nCopyhold has a reference to Tenure, of which it is a particular kind,\r\nand other references to Rolls, Custom, Manor, Fine, Charter-land and\r\nFreehold. In his preface he gives an \"analysis of the divisions of\r\nknowledge,\" 47 in number, with classed lists of the articles belonging\r\nto each, intended to serve as table of contents and also as a rubric or\r\ndirectory indicating the order in which the articles should be read. But\r\nit does so very imperfectly, as the lists are curtailed by many _et\r\ncaeteras_; thus 19 occur in a list of 119 articles under Anatomy, which\r\nhas nearly 2200 articles in Rees's index. He omits etymologies unless\r\n\"they appeared of some significance\"; he gives only one grammatical form\r\nof each word, unless peculiar ideas are arbitrarily attached to\r\ndifferent forms, as _precipitate_, _precipitant_, _precipitation_, when\r\neach has an article; and he omits complex ideas generally known, and\r\nthus \"gets free of a vast load of plebeian words.\" His work, he says, is\r\na collection, not the produce of one man's wit, for that would go but a\r\nlittle way, but of the whole commonwealth of learning. \"Nobody that fell\r\nin my way has been spared, antient or modern, foreign nor domestic,\r\nChristian or Jew nor heathen.\" To the subjects given by Harris he adds\r\ntheology, metaphysics, ethics, politics, logic, grammar, rhetoric and\r\npoetry, but excludes history, biography, genealogy, geography and\r\nchronology, except their technical parts. A second edition appeared in\r\n1738, fol. 2 vols., 2466 pages, \"retouched and amended in a thousand\r\nplaces.\" A few articles are added and some others enlarged, but he was\r\nprevented from doing more because \"the booksellers were alarmed with a\r\nbill in parliament containing a clause to oblige the publishers of all\r\nimproved editions of books to print their improvements separately.\" The\r\nbill after passing the Commons was unexpectedly thrown out by the\r\nLords; but fearing that it might be revived, the booksellers thought it\r\nbest to retreat though more than twenty sheets had been printed. Five\r\nother editions were published in London, 1739 to 1751-1752, besides one\r\nin Dublin, 1742, all in 2 vols. fol. An Italian translation, Venezia,\r\n1748-1749, 4to, 9 vols., was the first complete Italian encyclopaedia.\r\nWhen Chambers was in France in 1739 he rejected very favourable\r\nproposals to publish an edition there dedicated to Louis XV. His work\r\nwas judiciously, honestly and carefully done, and long maintained its\r\npopularity. But it had many defects and omissions, as he was well aware;\r\nand at his death, on the 15th of May 1740, he had collected and arranged\r\nmaterials for seven new volumes. John Lewis Scott was employed by the\r\nbooksellers to select such articles as were fit for the press and to\r\nsupply others. He is said to have done this very efficiently until\r\nappointed sub-preceptor to the prince of Wales and Prince Edward. His\r\ntask was entrusted to Dr (afterwards called Sir John) Hill, who\r\nperformed it very hastily, and with characteristic carelessness and\r\nself-sufficiency, copying freely from his own writings. The _Supplement_\r\nwas published in London, 1753, fol. 2 vols., 3307 pages and 12 plates.\r\nAs Hill was a botanist, the botanical part, which had been very\r\ndefective in the _Cyclopaedia_, was the best.\r\n\r\nAbraham Rees (1743-1825), a famous Nonconformist minister, published a\r\nrevised and enlarged edition, \"with the supplement and modern\r\nimprovements incorporated in one alphabet,\" London, 1778-1788, fol. 2\r\nvols., 5010 pages (but not paginated), 159 plates. It was published in\r\n418 numbers at 6d. each. Rees says that he has added more than 4400 new\r\narticles. At the end he gives an index of articles, classed under 100\r\nheads, numbering about 57,000 and filling 80 pages. The heads, with 39\r\ncross references, are arranged alphabetically. Subsequently there were\r\nreprints.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest and most comprehensive encyclopaedias was undertaken\r\nand in a great measure completed by Johann Heinrich Zedler, a bookseller\r\nof Leipzig, who was born at Breslau 7th January 1706, made a Prussian\r\ncommerzienrath in 1731, and died at Leipzig in 1760,--_Grosses\r\nvollstandiges Universal Lexicon Aller Wissenschaften und Kunste welche\r\nbishero durch menschlichen Verstand und Witz erfunden und verbessert\r\nworden_, Halle and Leipzig, 1732-1750, fol. 64 vols., 64,309 pages; and\r\n_Nothige Supplement_, ib. 1751-1754, vols. i. to iv., A to Caq, 3016\r\npages. The columns, two in a page, are numbered, varying from 1356 in\r\nvol. li. to 2588 in vol. xlix. Each volume has a dedication, with a\r\nportrait. The first nine are the emperor, the kings of Prussia and\r\nPoland, the empress of Russia, and the kings of England, France, Poland,\r\nDenmark and Sweden. The dedications, of which two are in verse, and all\r\nare signed by Zedler, amount to 459 pages. The supplement has no\r\ndedications or portraits. The preface to the first volume of the work is\r\nby Johann Peter von Ludewig, chancellor of the university of Halle (born\r\n15th August 1690, died 6th September 1743). Nine editors were employed,\r\nwhom Ludewig compares to the nine muses; and the whole of each subject\r\nwas entrusted to the same person, that all its parts might be uniformly\r\ntreated. Carl Gunther Ludovici (born at Leipzig 7th August 1707, public\r\nteacher of philosophy there from 1734, died 3rd July 1778) edited the\r\nwork from vol. xix., beginning the letter M, and published in 1739, to\r\nthe end, and also the supplement. The work was published by\r\nsubscription. Johann Heinrich Wolff, an eminent merchant and shopkeeper\r\nin Leipzig, born there on the 29th of April 1690, came to Zedler's\r\nassistance by advancing the funds for expenses and becoming answerable\r\nfor the subscriptions, and spared no cost that the work might be\r\ncomplete. Zedler very truly says, in his preface to vol. xviii., that\r\nhis _Universal Lexicon_ was a work such as no time and no nation could\r\nshow, and both in its plan and execution it is much more comprehensive\r\nand complete than any previous encyclopaedia. Colleges, says Ludewig,\r\nwhere all sciences are taught and studied, are on that account called\r\n_universities_, and their teaching is called _studium universale_; but\r\nthe _Universal Lexicon_ contains not only what they teach in theology,\r\njurisprudence, medicine, philosophy, history, mathematics, &c., but\r\nalso many other things belonging to courts, chanceries, hunting,\r\nforests, war and peace, and to artists, artizans, housekeepers and\r\nmerchants not thought of in colleges. Its plan embraces not only\r\nhistory, geography and biography, but also genealogy, topography, and\r\nfrom vol. xviii., published in 1738, lives of illustrious living\r\npersons. Zedler inquires why death alone should make a deserving man\r\ncapable of having his services and worthy deeds made known to the world\r\nin print. The lives of the dead, he says, are to be found in books, but\r\nthose of the living are not to be met with anywhere, and would often be\r\nmore useful if known. In consequence of this preface, many lives and\r\ngenealogies were sent to him for publication. Cross references generally\r\ngive not only the article referred to, but also the volume and column,\r\nand, when necessary, such brief information as may distinguish the word\r\nreferred to from others similar but of different meaning. Lists of\r\nauthorities, often long, exact and valuable are frequently appended to\r\nthe articles. This work, which is well and carefully compiled, and very\r\ntrustworthy, is still a most valuable book of reference on many\r\nsubjects, especially topography, genealogy and biography. The\r\ngenealogies and family histories are excellent, and many particulars are\r\ngiven of the lives and works of authors not easily found elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA work on a new plan was published by Dennis de Coetlogon, a Frenchman\r\nnaturalized in England, who styled himself \"Knight of St Lazare, M.D.,\r\nand member of the Royal Academy of Angers\"--_An Universal History of\r\nArts and Sciences_, London, 1745, fol. 2 vols., 2529 pages, 33 plates\r\nand 161 articles arranged alphabetically. He \"endeavours to render each\r\ntreatise as complete as possible, avoiding above all things needless\r\nrepetitions, and never puzzling the reader with the least reference.\"\r\nTheology is divided into several treatises; Philosophy into Ethicks,\r\nLogick and Metaphysick, each under its letter; and Physick is subdivided\r\ninto Anatomy, Botany, Geography, Geometry, &c. Military Art is divided\r\ninto Army, Fortification, Gunnery. The royal licence is dated 13th March\r\n1740-1741, the dedication is to the duke of Gisors, the pages are\r\nnumbered, there is an appendix of 35 pages of astronomical tables, and\r\nthe two indexes, one to each volume, fill 69 pages, and contain about\r\n9000 subjects. The type is large and the style diffuse, but the subject\r\nmatter is sometimes curious. The author says that his work is the only\r\none of the kind, and that he wrote out with his own hand every line,\r\neven the index. But notwithstanding the novelty of his plan, his work\r\ndoes not seem ever to have been popular.\r\n\r\nGianfrancesco Pivati, born at Padua in 1689, died at Venice in 1764,\r\nsecretary of the Academy of Sciences at Venice, who had published in\r\n1744 a 4to volume containing a _Dizionario universale_, wrote _Nuovo\r\ndizionario scientifico e curioso sacro-profano_, Venezia, 1746-1751,\r\nfol. 10 vols., 7791 pages, 597 plates. It is a general encyclopaedia,\r\nincluding geography, but not history or biography. He gives frequent\r\nreferences to his authorities and much curious information. His\r\npreliminary discourse (80 pages) contains a history of the several\r\nsciences from mathematics to geography. The book was published by\r\nsubscription, and at the end of the last volume is a _Catalogo dei\r\nSignori Associati_, 252 in number, who took 266 copies. It is also\r\nremarkable for the number of its plates, which are engraved on copper.\r\nIn each volume they are placed together at the end, and are preceded by\r\nan explanatory index of subjects referring to the plates and to the\r\narticles they illustrate.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest and most remarkable literary enterprises of the 18th\r\ncentury, the famous French _Encyclopedie_, originated in a French\r\ntranslation of Ephraim Chambers's _Cyclopaedia_, begun in 1743 and\r\nfinished in 1745 by John Mills, an Englishman resident in France,\r\nassisted by Gottfried Sellius, a very learned native of Danzig, who,\r\nafter being a professor at Halle and Gottingen, and residing in Holland,\r\nhad settled in Paris. They applied to Lebreton, the king's printer, to\r\npublish the work, to fulfil the formalities required by French law, with\r\nwhich, as foreigners, they were not acquainted, and to solicit a royal\r\nprivilege. This he obtained, but in his own name alone. Mills\r\ncomplained so loudly and bitterly of this deception that Lebreton had\r\nto acknowledge formally that the privilege belonged _en toute propriete_\r\nto John Mills. But, as he again took care not to acquaint Mills with the\r\nnecessary legal formalities, this title soon became invalid. Mills then\r\nagreed to grant him part of his privilege, and in May 1745 the work was\r\nannounced as _Encyclopedie ou dictionnaire universel des arts et des\r\nsciences_, folio, four volumes of 250 to 260 sheets each, with a fifth\r\nof at least 120 plates, and a vocabulary or list of articles in French,\r\nLatin, German, Italian and Spanish, with other lists for each language\r\nexplained in French, so that foreigners might easily find any article\r\nwanted. It was to be published by subscription at 135 livres, but for\r\nlarge paper copies 200 livres, the first volume to be delivered in June\r\n1746, and the two last at the end of 1748. The subscription list, which\r\nwas considerable, closed on the 31st of December 1745. Mills demanded an\r\naccount, which Lebreton, who had again omitted certain formalities,\r\ninsultingly refused. Mills brought an action against him, but before it\r\nwas decided Lebreton procured the revocation of the privilege as\r\ninformal, and obtained another for himself dated the 21st of January\r\n1746. Thus, for unwittingly contravening regulations with which his\r\nunscrupulous publisher ought to have made him acquainted, Mills was\r\ndespoiled of the work he had both planned and executed, and had to\r\nreturn to England. Jean Paul de Gua de Malves, professor of philosophy\r\nin the college of France (born at Carcassonne in 1713, died on the 15th\r\nof June 1785), was then engaged as editor merely to correct errors and\r\nadd new discoveries. But he proposed a thorough revision, and obtained\r\nthe assistance of many learned men and artists, among whom Desessarts\r\nnames Louis, Condillac, d'Alembert and Diderot. But the publishers did\r\nnot think his reputation high enough to ensure success, withheld their\r\nconfidence, and often opposed his plans as too expensive. Tired at last\r\nof disputes, and too easily offended, de Gua resigned the editorship.\r\nThe publishers, who had already made heavy advances, offered it to\r\nDiderot, who was probably recommended to them by his very well received\r\n_Dictionnaire universel de medicine_, Paris, 1746-1748, fol. 6 vols.,\r\npublished by Briasson, David and Durand, with notes and additions by\r\nJulien Busson, doctor regent of the faculty of medicine of Paris. It was\r\na translation, made with the assistance of Eidous and Toussaint, of the\r\ncelebrated work of Dr Robert James, inventor of the fever powders, _A\r\nMedicinal Dictionary_, London, 1743-1745, fol. 3 vols., 3275 pages and\r\n98 plates, comprising a history of drugs, with chemistry, botany and\r\nnatural history so far as they relate to medicine, and with an\r\nhistorical preface of 99 pages (in the translation 136). The proposed\r\nwork was to have been similar in character. De Gua's papers were handed\r\nover to Diderot in great confusion. He soon persuaded the publishers to\r\nundertake a far more original and comprehensive work. His friend\r\nd'Alembert undertook to edit the mathematics. Other subjects were\r\nallotted to 21 contributors, each of whom received the articles on this\r\nsubject in Mills' translation to serve as a basis for his work. But they\r\nwere in most cases so badly composed and translated, so full of errors\r\nand omissions, that they were not used. The contributions were to be\r\nfinished in three months, but none was ready in time, except Music by\r\nRousseau, which he admits was hastily and badly done. Diderot was\r\nimprisoned at Vincennes, on the 29th of July 1749, for his _Lettre sur\r\nles aveugles_. He was closely confined for 28 days, and was then for\r\nthree months and ten days a prisoner on parole in the castle. This did\r\nnot stop the printing, though it caused delay. The prospectus by Diderot\r\nappeared in November 1750. The work was to form 8 vols. fol., with at\r\nleast 600 plates. The first volume was published in July 1751, and\r\ndelivered to the subscribers in August. The second appeared in January\r\n1752. An _arret_ of the council, 9th of February, suppressed both\r\nvolumes as injurious to the king's authority and to religion.\r\nMalesherbes, director-general of the Librairie, stopped the issue of\r\nvolume ii., 9th of February, and on the 21st went with a _lettre de\r\ncachet_ to Lebreton's to seize the plates and the MSS., but did not\r\nfind, says Barbier, even those of volume iii., as they had been taken to\r\nhis own house by Diderot and one of the publishers. The Jesuits tried\r\nto continue the work, but in vain. It was less easy, says Grimm, than to\r\nruin philosophers. The _Dictionnaire de Trevoux_ pronounced the\r\ncompletion of the _Encyclopedie_ impossible, and the project ridiculous\r\n(5th edition, 1752, iii, 750). The government had to request the editors\r\nto resume the work as one honourable to the nation. The marquis\r\nd'Argenson writes, 7th of May 1752, that Mme de Pompadour had been\r\nurging them to proceed, and at the end of June he reports them as again\r\nat work. Volume iii., rather improved by the delay, appeared in October\r\n1753; and volume vii., completing G, in November 1757. The clamours\r\nagainst the work soon recommenced. D' Alembert retired in January 1758,\r\nweary of sermons, satires and intolerant and absurd censors. The\r\nparlement of Paris, by an _arret_, 23rd of January 1759, stopped the\r\nsale and distribution of the _Encyclopedie_, Helvetius's _De l'Esprit_,\r\nand six other books; and by an _arret_, 6th February, ordered them all\r\nto be burnt, but referred the _Encyclopedie_ for examination to a\r\ncommission of nine. An _arret du conseil_, 7th of March, revoked the\r\nprivilege of 1746, and stopped the printing. Volume viii. was then in\r\nthe press. Malesherbes warned Diderot that he would have his papers\r\nseized next day; and when Diderot said he could not make a selection, or\r\nfind a place of safety at such short notice, Malesherbes said, \"Send\r\nthem to me, they will not look for them there.\" This, according to Mme\r\nde Vandeul, Diderot's daughter, was done with perfect success. In the\r\narticle Pardonner Diderot refers to these persecutions, and says, \"In\r\nthe space of some months we have seen our honour, fortune, liberty and\r\nlife imperilled.\" Malesherbes, Choiseul and Mme de Pompadour protected\r\nthe work; Diderot obtained private permission to go on printing, but\r\nwith a strict charge not to publish any part until the whole was\r\nfinished. The Jesuits were condemned by the parlement of Paris in 1762,\r\nand by the king in November 1764. Volume i. of plates appeared in 1762,\r\nand volumes viii. to xvii., ten volumes of text, 9408 pages, completing\r\nthe work, with the 4th volume of plates in 1765, when there were 4250\r\nsubscribers. The work circulated freely in the provinces and in foreign\r\ncountries, and was secretly distributed in Paris and Versailles. The\r\ngeneral assembly of the clergy, on the 20th of June 1765, approved\r\narticles in which it was condemned, and on the 27th of September adopted\r\na _memoire_ to be presented to the king. They were forbidden to publish\r\ntheir acts which favoured the Jesuits, but Lebreton was required to give\r\na list of his subscribers, and was put into the Bastille for eight days\r\nin 1766. A royal order was sent to the subscribers to deliver their\r\ncopies to the lieutenant of police. Voltaire in 1774 relates that, at a\r\n_petit souper_ of the king at Trianon, there was a debate on the\r\ncomposition of gunpowder. Mme de Pompadour said she did not know how her\r\nrouge or her silk stockings were made. The duc de la Valliere regretted\r\nthat the king had confiscated their encyclopaedias, which could decide\r\neverything. The king said he had been told that the work was most\r\ndangerous, but as he wished to judge for himself, he sent for a copy.\r\nThree servants with difficulty brought in the 21 volumes. The company\r\nfound everything they looked for, and the king allowed the confiscated\r\ncopies to be returned. Mme de Pompadour died on the 15th of April 1764.\r\nLebreton had half of the property in the work, and Durand, David and\r\nBriasson had the rest. Lebreton, who had the largest printing office in\r\nParis, employed 50 workmen in printing the last ten volumes. He had the\r\narticles set in type exactly as the authors sent them in, and when\r\nDiderot had corrected the last proof of each sheet, he and his foreman,\r\nhastily, secretly and by night, unknown to his partners in the work, cut\r\nout whatever seemed to them daring, or likely to give offence, mutilated\r\nmost of the best articles without any regard to the consecutiveness of\r\nwhat was left, and burnt the manuscript as they proceeded. The printing\r\nof the work was nearly finished when Diderot, having to consult one of\r\nhis great philosophical articles in the letter S, found it entirely\r\nmutilated. He was confounded, says Grimm, at discovering the atrocity of\r\nthe printer; all the best articles were in the same confusion. This\r\ndiscovery put him into a state of frenzy and despair from rage and\r\ngrief. His daughter never heard him speak coolly on the subject, and\r\nafter twenty years it still made him angry. He believed that every one\r\nknew as well as he did what was wanting in each article, but in fact the\r\nmutilation was not perceived even by the authors, and for many years was\r\nknown to few persons. Diderot at first refused to correct the remaining\r\nproofs, or to do more than write the explanations of the plates. He\r\nrequired, according to Mme de Vandeul, that a copy, now at St Petersburg\r\nwith his library, should be printed with columns in which all was\r\nrestored. The mutilations began as far back as the article Intendant.\r\nBut how far, says Rosenkranz, this murderous, incredible and infamous\r\noperation was carried cannot now be exactly ascertained. Diderot's\r\narticles, not including those on arts and trades, were reprinted in\r\nNaigeon's edition (Paris, 1821, 8vo, 22 vols.). They fill 4132 pages,\r\nand number 1139, of which 601 were written for the last ten volumes.\r\nThey are on very many subjects, but principally on grammar, history,\r\nmorality, philosophy, literature and metaphysics. As a contributor, his\r\nspecial department of the work was philosophy, and arts and trades. He\r\npassed whole days in workshops, and began by examining a machine\r\ncarefully, then he had it taken to pieces and put together again, then\r\nhe watched it at work, and lastly worked it himself. He thus learned to\r\nuse such complicated machines as the stocking and cut velvet looms. He\r\nat first received 1200 livres a year as editor, but afterwards 2500\r\nlivres a volume, besides a final sum of 20,000 livres. Although after\r\nhis engagement he did not suffer from poverty as he had done before, he\r\nwas obliged to sell his library in order to provide for his daughter. De\r\nJaucourt spared neither time, trouble nor expense in perfecting the\r\nwork, for which he received nothing, and he employed several secretaries\r\nat it for ten years. To pay them he had to sell his house in Paris,\r\nwhich Lebreton bought with the profits derived from De Jaucourt's work.\r\nAll the publishers made large fortunes; their expenses amounted to\r\n1,158,000 livres and their profits to 2,162,000. D'Alembert's \"Discours\r\nPreliminaire,\" 45 pages, written in 1750, prefixed to the first volume,\r\nand delivered before the French Academy on his reception on the 19th of\r\nDecember 1754, consists of a systematic arrangement of the various\r\nbranches of knowledge, and an account of their progress since their\r\nrevival. His system, chiefly taken from Bacon, divides them into three\r\nclasses, under memory, reason and imagination. Arts and trades are\r\nplaced under natural history, superstition and magic under science de\r\nDieu, and orthography and heraldry under logic. The literary world is\r\ndivided into three corresponding classes--_erudits_, _philosophes_ and\r\n_beaux esprits_. As in Ephraim Chambers's _Cyclopaedia_, history and\r\nbiography were excluded, except incidentally; thus Aristotle's life is\r\ngiven in the article Aristotelisme. The science to which an article\r\nbelongs is generally named at the beginning of it, references are given\r\nto other articles, and the authors' names are marked by initials, of\r\nwhich lists are given in the earlier volumes, but sometimes their names\r\nare subscribed in full. Articles by Diderot have no mark, and those\r\ninserted by him as editor have an asterisk prefixed. Among the\r\ncontributors were Voltaire, Euler, Marmontel, Montesquieu, D'Anville,\r\nD'Holbach and Turgot, the leader of the new school of economists which\r\nmade its first appearance in the pages of the _Encyclopedie_. Louis\r\nwrote the surgery, Daubenton natural history, Eidous heraldry and art,\r\nToussaint jurisprudence, and Condamine articles on South America.\r\n\r\n  No encyclopaedia perhaps has been of such political importance, or has\r\n  occupied so conspicuous a place in the civil and literary history of\r\n  its century. It sought not only to give information, but to guide\r\n  opinion. It was, as Rosenkranz says (_Diderot_, i. 157), theistic and\r\n  heretical. It was opposed to the church, then all-powerful in France,\r\n  and it treated dogma historically. It was, as Desnoiresterres says\r\n  (_Voltaire_, v. 164), a war machine; as it progressed, its attacks\r\n  both on the church and the still more despotic government, as well as\r\n  on Christianity itself, became bolder and more undisguised, and it was\r\n  met by opposition and persecution unparalleled in the history of\r\n  encyclopaedias. Its execution is very unequal, and its articles of\r\n  very different value. It was not constructed on a regular plan, or\r\n  subjected to sufficient supervision; articles were sent in by the\r\n  contributors, and not seen by the editors until they were in type. In\r\n  each subject there are some excellent articles, but others are very\r\n  inferior or altogether omitted, and references are often given to\r\n  articles which do not exist. Thus marine is said to be more than\r\n  three-fourths deficient; and in geography errors and omissions\r\n  abound--even capitals and sovereign states are overlooked, while\r\n  villages are given as towns, and towns are described which never\r\n  existed. The style is too generally loose, digressive and inexact;\r\n  dates are seldom given; and discursiveness, verbosity and dogmatism\r\n  are frequent faults. Voltaire was constantly demanding truth, brevity\r\n  and method, and said it was built half of marble and half of wood.\r\n  D'Alembert compared it to a harlequin's coat, in which there is some\r\n  good stuff but too many rags. Diderot was dissatisfied with it as a\r\n  whole; much of it was compiled in haste; and carelessly written\r\n  articles and incompetent contributors were admitted for want of money\r\n  to pay good writers. Zedler's _Universal Lexicon_ is on the whole much\r\n  more useful for reference than its far more brilliant successor. The\r\n  permanent value of encyclopaedias depends on the proportion of exact\r\n  and precise facts they contain and on their systematic regularity.\r\n\r\n  The first edition of the _Encyclopedie_, in 17 vols. folio, 16,288\r\n  pages, was imitated by a counterfeit edition printed at Geneva as the\r\n  volumes appeared in Paris. Eleven folio volumes of plates were\r\n  published at Paris (1762 to 1772), containing 2888 plates and 923\r\n  pages of explanation, &c. A supplement was printed at Amsterdam and\r\n  Paris (1776-1777), fol. 5 vols., 3874 pages, with 224 plates. History\r\n  was introduced at the wish of the public, but only \"the general\r\n  features which mark epochs in the annals of the world.\" The astronomy\r\n  was by Delalande, mathematics by Condorcet, tables by Bernouilli,\r\n  natural history by Adanson, anatomy and physiology by Haller.\r\n  Daubenton, Condamine, Marmontel and other old contributors wrote many\r\n  articles, and several were taken from foreign editions. A very full\r\n  and elaborate index of the articles and subjects of the 33 volumes was\r\n  printed at Amsterdam in 1780, fol. 2 vols. 1852 pages. It was made by\r\n  Pierre Mouchon, who was born at Geneva on the 30th of July 1735,\r\n  consecrated minister on the 18th of August 1758, pastor of the French\r\n  church at Basel 1766, elected a pastor in Geneva on the 6th of March\r\n  1788, principal of the college there 22nd of April 1791, died on the\r\n  20th of August 1797. This _Table analytique_, which took him five\r\n  years to make, was undertaken for the publishers Cramer and De\r\n  Tournes, who gave him 800 louis for it. Though very exact and full, he\r\n  designedly omits the attacks on Christianity. This index was rendered\r\n  more useful and indispensable by the very diffuse and digressive style\r\n  of the work, and by the vast number of its articles. A complete copy\r\n  of the first edition of the _Encyclopedie_ consists of 35 vols. fol.,\r\n  printed 1751-1780, containing 23,135 pages and 3132 plates. It was\r\n  written by about 160 contributors. About 1761 Panckoucke and other\r\n  publishers in Paris proposed a new and revised edition, and bought the\r\n  plates for 250,000 livres. But, as Diderot indignantly refused to edit\r\n  what he considered a fraud on the subscribers to the as yet unfinished\r\n  work, they began simply to reprint the work, promising supplementary\r\n  volumes. When three volumes were printed the whole was seized in 1770\r\n  by the government at the complaint of the clergy, and was lodged in\r\n  the Bastille. The plan of a second French edition was laid aside then,\r\n  to be revived twenty years later in a very different form. Foreign\r\n  editions of the _Encyclopedie_ are numerous, and it is difficult to\r\n  enumerate them correctly. One, with notes by Ottavio Diodati, Dr\r\n  Sebastiano Paoli and Carlo Giuliani, appeared at Lucca (1758-1771),\r\n  fol. 17 vols. of text and 10 of plates. Though it was very much\r\n  expurgated, all engaged in it were excommunicated by the pope in 1759.\r\n  An attempt made at Siena to publish an Italian translation failed. An\r\n  addition by the abbe Serafini and Dr Gonnella (Livourne, 1770), &c.,\r\n  fol. 33 vols., returned a profit of 60,000 piastres, and was protected\r\n  by Leopold II., who secured the pope's silence. Other editions are\r\n  Geneve, Cramer (1772-1776), a facsimile reprint. Geneve, Pellet\r\n  (1777-1779), 4to, 36 vols. of text and 3 of plates, with 6 vols. of\r\n  Mouchon's index (Lyon, 1780), 4to; Geneve et Neufchatel, Pellet\r\n  (1778-1779), 4to, 36 vols. of text and 3 of plates; Lausanne\r\n  (1778-1781), 36 vols. 4to, or 72 octavo, of text and 3 of plates\r\n  (1779-1780); Lausanne et Bern, chez les Societes Typographiques\r\n  (1780-1782), 36 vols. 8vo of text and 3 vols. 4to of plates (1782).\r\n  These four editions have the supplement incorporated. Fortune\r\n  Barthelemy de Felice, an Italian monk, born at Rome on the 24th of\r\n  August 1723, who had been professor at Rome and Naples, and had become\r\n  a Protestant, printed a very incorrect though successful edition\r\n  (Yverdun, 1770-1780) 4to, 42 vols. of text, 5 of supplement and 10 of\r\n  plates. It professed to be a new work, standing in the same\r\n  relationship to the _Encyclopedie_ as that did to Chambers's, which is\r\n  far from being the case. Sir Joseph Ayloffe issued proposals, 14th\r\n  December 1751, for an English translation of the _Encyclopedie_, to be\r\n  finished by Christmas 1756, in 10 vols. 4to, with at least 600 plates.\r\n  No. 1 appeared in January 1752, but met with little success. Several\r\n  selections of articles and extracts have been published under the\r\n  title of _L'Esprit de l'Encyclopedie_. The last was by Hennequin\r\n  (Paris, 1822-1823), 8vo, 15 vols. An English selection is _Select\r\n  Essays from the Encyclopedy_ (London, 1773), 8vo. The articles of most\r\n  of the principal contributors have been reprinted in the editions of\r\n  their respective works. Voltaire wrote 8 vols. 8vo of a kind of\r\n  fragmentary supplement, _Questions sur l'Encyclopedie_, frequently\r\n  printed, and usually included in editions of his works, together with\r\n  his contributions to the _Encyclopedie_ and his _Dictionnaire\r\n  philosophique_. Several special dictionaries have been formed from the\r\n  _Encyclopedie_, as the _Dictionnaire portatif des arts et metiers_\r\n  (Paris, 1766), 8vo, 2 vols. about 1300 pages, by Philippe Macquer,\r\n  brother of the author of the _Dict. de chimie_. An enlarged edition by\r\n  the abbe Jaubert (Paris, 1773), 5 vols. 8vo, 3017 pages, was much\r\n  valued and often reprinted. The books attacking and defending the\r\n  _Encyclopedie_ are very many. No original work of the 18th century,\r\n  says Lanfrey, has been more depreciated, ridiculed and calumniated. It\r\n  has been called chaos, nothingness, the Tower of Babel, a work of\r\n  disorder and destruction, the gospel of Satan and even the ruins of\r\n  Palmyra.\r\n\r\nThe _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, \"by a society of gentlemen in Scotland,\r\nprinted in Edinburgh for A. Bell and C. Macfarquhar, and sold by Colin\r\nMacfarquhar at his printing office in Nicolson Street,\" was completed in\r\n1771 in 3 volumes 4to, containing 2670 pages, and 160 copperplates\r\nengraved by Andrew Bell. It was published in numbers, of which the two\r\nfirst were issued in December 1768, \"price 6d. each, or 8d on a finer\r\npaper,\" and was to be completed in 100 weekly numbers. It was compiled,\r\nas the title-page says, on a new plan. The different sciences and arts\r\nwere \"digested into distinct treatises or systems,\" of which there are\r\n45 with cross headings, that is, titles printed across the page, and\r\nabout 30 other articles more than three pages long. The longest are\r\n\"Anatomy,\" 166 pages, and \"Surgery,\" 238 pages. \"The various technical\r\nterms, &c., are explained as they occur in the order of the alphabet.\"\r\n\"Instead of dismembering the sciences, by attempting to treat them\r\nintelligibly under a multitude of technical terms, they have digested\r\nthe principles of every science in the form of systems or distinct\r\ntreatises, and explained the terms as they occur in the order of the\r\nalphabet, with references to the sciences to which they belong.\" This\r\nplan, as the compilers say, differs from that of all the previous\r\ndictionaries of arts and sciences. Its merit and novelty consist in the\r\ncombination of De Coetlogon's plan with that in common use,--on the one\r\nhand keeping important subjects together, and on the other facilitating\r\nreference by numerous separate articles. It is doubtful to whom the\r\ncredit of this plan is due. The editor, William Smellie, a printer (born\r\nin 1740, died on the 24th of June 1795), afterwards secretary and\r\nsuperintendent of natural history to the Society of Scottish\r\nAntiquaries, is said by his biographer to have devised the plan and\r\nwritten or compiled all the chief articles; and he prints, but without\r\ndate, part of a letter written and signed by Andrew Bell by which he was\r\nengaged in the work:--\"Sir, As we are engaged in publishing a dictionary\r\nof the arts and sciences, and as you have informed us that there are\r\nfifteen capital sciences which you will undertake for and write up the\r\nsubdivisions and detached parts of these conform to your plan, and\r\nlikewise to prepare the whole work for the press, &c., &c., we hereby\r\nagree to allow you L200 for your trouble, &c.\" Prof. Macvey Napier says\r\nthat Smellie \"was more likely to have suggested that great improvement\r\nthan any of his known coadjutors.\" Archibald Constable, who was\r\ninterested in the work from 1788, and was afterwards intimately\r\nacquainted with Bell, says Colin Macfarquhar was the actual projector of\r\nthe _Encyclopaedia_, and the editor of the two first editions, while\r\nSmellie was merely \"a contributor for hire\" (_Memoirs_, ii. 311). Dr\r\nGleig, in his preface to the third edition, says: \"The idea had been\r\nconceived by him (Colin Macfarquhar) and his friend Mr Andrew Bell,\r\nengraver. By whom these gentlemen were assisted in digesting the plan\r\nwhich attracted to that work so much public attention, or whether they\r\nhad any assistance, are questions in which our readers cannot be\r\ninterested.\" Macfarquhar, according to Constable, was a person of\r\nexcellent taste and very general knowledge, though at starting he had\r\nlittle or no capital, and was obliged to associate Bell, then the\r\nprincipal engraver in Edinburgh, as a partner in his undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe second edition was begun in 1776, and was published in numbers, of\r\nwhich the first was issued on the 21st of June 1777, and the last, No.\r\n181, on the 18th of September 1784, forming 10 vols. 4to, dated 1778 to\r\n1783, and containing 8595 pages and 340 plates. The pagination is\r\ncontinuous, ending with page 9200, but 295 pages are inserted in\r\nvarious places, and page 7099 is followed by 8000. The number and length\r\nof the articles were much increased, 72 have cross headings, and more\r\nthan 150 others may be classed as long articles. At the end is an\r\nappendix (\"Abatement\" to \"Wood\") of 200 pages, containing, under the\r\nheading Botanical Table, a list of the 931 genera included in the 58\r\nnatural orders of Linnaeus, and followed by a list of 526 books, said to\r\nhave been the principal authorities used. All the maps are placed\r\ntogether under the article \"Geography\" (195 pages). Most of the long\r\narticles have numbered marginal titles; \"Scotland,\" 84 pages, has 837.\r\n\"Medicine,\" 309 pages, and \"Pharmacy\" have each an index. The plan of\r\nthe work was enlarged by the addition of history and biography, which\r\nencyclopaedias in general had long omitted. \"From the time of the second\r\nedition of this work, every cyclopaedia of note, in England and\r\nelsewhere, has been a cyclopaedia, not solely of arts and sciences, but\r\nof the whole wide circle of general learning and miscellaneous\r\ninformation\" (_Quarterly Review_, cxiii. 362). Smellie was applied to by\r\nBell to edit the second edition, and to take a share of one-third in the\r\nwork; but he refused, because the other persons concerned in it, at the\r\nsuggestion of \"a very distinguished nobleman of very high rank\" (said by\r\nProfessor Napier to have been the duke of Buccleuch), insisted upon the\r\nintroduction of a system of general biography which he considered\r\ninconsistent with the character of a dictionary of arts and sciences.\r\nJames Tytler, M.A., seems to have been selected as the next most\r\neligible compiler. His father, a man of extensive knowledge, was 53\r\nyears minister of Fearn in Forfarshire, and died in 1785. Tytler\r\n(outlawed by the High Court of Justiciary, 7th of January 1793, buried\r\nat Salem in Massachusetts on the 11th of January 1804, aged fifty-eight)\r\n\"wrote,\" says Watt, \"many of the scientific treatises and histories, and\r\nalmost all the minor articles\" (_Bibliotheca Brit._).\r\n\r\nAfter about a year's preparation, the third edition was announced in\r\n1787; the first number was published early in 1788, and the first volume\r\nin October 1788. There were to be 300 weekly numbers, price 1s. each,\r\nforming 30 parts at 10s. 6d. each, and 15 volumes, with 360 plates. It\r\nwas completed in 1797 in 18 vols. 4to, containing 14,579 pages and 542\r\nplates. Among the multifarious articles represented in the frontispiece,\r\nwhich was required by the traditional fashion of the period, is a\r\nballoon. The maps are, as in subsequent editions, distributed among the\r\narticles relating to the respective countries. It was edited by Colin\r\nMacfarquhar as far as the article \"Mysteries\" (by Dr Doig, vol. xii.),\r\nwhen he died, on the 2nd of April 1793, in his forty-eighth year, \"worn\r\nout,\" says Constable, \"by fatigue and anxiety of mind.\" His children's\r\ntrustees and Andrew Bell requested George Gleig of Stirling (consecrated\r\non the 30th of October 1808 assistant and successor to the bishop of\r\nBrechin), who had written about twelve articles, to edit the rest of the\r\nwork; \"and for the time, and the limited sum allowed him for the reward\r\nof contributors, his part in the work was considered very well done\"\r\n(Constable, ii. 312). Professor Robison was induced by Gleig to become a\r\ncontributor. He first revised the article \"Optics,\" and then wrote a\r\nseries of articles on natural philosophy, which attracted great\r\nattention and were long highly esteemed by scientific men. The\r\nsub-editors were James Walker (Primus Scotiae Episcopus 27th of May\r\n1837, died on the 5th of March 1841, aged seventy) until 1795, then\r\nJames Thomson, succeeded in November 1796 by his brother Thomas,\r\nafterwards professor of chemistry at Glasgow, who remained connected\r\nwith the _Encyclopaedia_ until 1800. According to Kerr (_Smellie's\r\nLife_, i. 364-365), 10,000 copies were printed, and the profit to the\r\nproprietors was L42,000, besides the payments for their respective work\r\nin the conduct of the publication as tradesmen,--Bell as engraver of all\r\nthe plates, and Macfarquhar as sole printer. According to Constable\r\n(_Memoirs_, ii. 312), the impression was begun at 5000 copies, and\r\nconcluded with a sale of 13,000. James Hunter, \"an active bookseller of\r\nno character,\" who had a shop in Middle Row, Holborn, sold the book to\r\nthe trade, and on his failure Thomson Bonar, a wine merchant, who had\r\nmarried Bell's daughter, became the seller of the book. He quarrelled\r\nwith his father-in-law, who would not see him for ten years before his\r\ndeath in 1809. When the edition was completed, the copyright and\r\nremaining books were sold in order to wind up the concern, and \"the\r\nwhole was purchased by Bell, who gave L13 a copy, sold all the complete\r\ncopies to the trade, printed up the odd volumes, and thus kept the work\r\nin the market for several years\" (Constable, ii. 312)\r\n\r\nThe supplement of the third edition, printed for Thomson Bonar, and\r\nedited by Gleig, was published in 1801 in 2 vols. 4to, containing 1624\r\npages and 50 copperplates engraved by D. Lizars. In the dedication to\r\nthe king, dated Stirling, 10th December 1800, Dr Gleig says: \"The French\r\n_Encyclopedie_ had been accused, and justly accused, of having\r\ndisseminated far and wide the seeds of anarchy and atheism. If the\r\n_Encyclopaedia Britannica_ shall in any degree counteract the tendency\r\nof that pestiferous work, even these two volumes will not be wholly\r\nunworthy of your Majesty's attention.\" Professor Robison added 19\r\narticles to the series he had begun when the third edition was so far\r\nadvanced. Professor Playfair assisted in \"Mathematics.\" Dr Thomas\r\nThomson wrote \"Chemistry,\" \"Mineralogy\" and other articles, in which the\r\nuse of symbols was for the first time introduced into chemistry; and\r\nthese articles formed the first outline of his _System of Chemistry_,\r\npublished at Edinburgh in 1802, 8vo, 4 vols.; the sixth edition, 1821.\r\n\r\nThe fourth edition, printed for Andrew Bell, was begun in 1800 or 1801,\r\nand finished in 1810 in 20 vols. 4to, containing 16,033 pages, with 581\r\nplates engraved by Bell. The dedication to the king, signed Andrew Bell,\r\nis dated Lauristoun, Edinburgh, 1809. The preface is that of the third\r\nedition with the necessary alterations and additions in the latter part.\r\nNo articles were reprinted from the supplement, as Bell had not the\r\ncopyright. Professor Wallace's articles on mathematics were much valued,\r\nand raised the scientific character of the work. Dr Thomas Thomson\r\ndeclined the editorship, and recommended Dr James Millar, afterwards\r\neditor of the _Encyclopaedia Edinensis_ (died on the 13th of July 1827).\r\nHe was fond of natural history and a good chemist, but, according to\r\nConstable, slow and dilatory and not well qualified. Andrew Bell died on\r\nthe 10th of June 1809, aged eighty-three, \"leaving,\" says Constable,\r\n\"two sets of trustees, one literary to make the money, the other legal\r\nto lay it out after it was made.\" The edition began with 1250 copies and\r\nconcluded at 4000, of which two-thirds passed through the hands of\r\nConstable's firm. Early in 1804 Andrew Bell had offered Constable and\r\nhis partner Hunter the copyright of the work, printing materials, &c.,\r\nand all that was then printed of the fourth edition, for L20,000. This\r\noffer was in agitation in March 1804, when the two partners were in\r\nLondon. On the 5th of May 1804, after Lord Jeffrey's arrival in\r\nEdinburgh, as he relates to Francis Horner, they entrusted him with a\r\ndesign, on which he found that most of his friends had embarked with\r\ngreat eagerness, \"for publishing an entire new encyclopaedia upon an\r\nimproved plan. Stewart, I understand, is to lend his name, and to write\r\nthe preliminary discourse, besides other articles. Playfair is to\r\nsuperintend the mathematical department, and Robison the natural\r\nphilosophy. Thomas Thomson is extremely zealous in the cause. W. Scott\r\nhas embraced it with great affection.... The authors are to be paid at\r\nleast as well as reviewers, and are to retain the copyright of their\r\narticles for separate publication if they think proper\" (Cockburn, _Life\r\nof Lord Jeffrey_, 1852, ii. 90). It was then, perhaps, that Constable\r\ngave L100 to Bonar for the copyright of the supplement.\r\n\r\n  The fifth edition was begun immediately after the fourth as a mere\r\n  reprint. \"The management of the edition, or rather mismanagement, went\r\n  on under the _lawyer trustees_ for several years, and at last the\r\n  whole property was again brought to the market by public sale. There\r\n  were about 1800 copies printed of the five first volumes, which formed\r\n  one lot, the copyright formed another lot, and so on. The whole was\r\n  purchased by myself and in my name for between L13,000 and L14,000,\r\n  and it was said by the wise booksellers of Edinburgh and others that\r\n  I had completely ruined myself and all connected with me by a purchase\r\n  to such an enormous amount; this was early in 1812\" (Constable, ii.\r\n  314). Bonar, who lived next door to the printing office, thought he\r\n  could conduct the book, and had resolved on the purchase. Having a\r\n  good deal of money, he seemed to Constable a formidable rival, whose\r\n  alliance was to be secured. After \"sundry interviews\" it was agreed\r\n  that Constable should buy the copyright in his own name, and that\r\n  Bonar should have one-third, and also one-third of the copyright of\r\n  the supplement, for which he gave L200. Dr James Millar corrected and\r\n  revised the last 15 volumes. The preface is dated the 1st of December\r\n  1814. The printing was superintended by Bonar, who died on the 26th of\r\n  July 1814. His trustees were repaid his advances on the work, about\r\n  L6000, and the copyright was valued at L11,000, of which they received\r\n  one-third, Constable adding L500, as the book had been so extremely\r\n  successful. It was published in 20 vols., 16,017 pages, 582 plates,\r\n  price L36, and dated 1817.\r\n\r\n  Soon after the purchase of the copyright, Constable began to prepare\r\n  for the publication of a supplement, to be of four or, at the very\r\n  utmost, five volumes. \"The first article arranged for was one on\r\n  'Chemistry' by Sir Humphry Davy, but he went abroad [in October 1813]\r\n  and I released him from his engagement, and employed Mr Brande; the\r\n  second article was Mr Stewart's Dissertation, for which I agreed to\r\n  pay him L1000, leaving the extent of it to himself, but with this\r\n  understanding, that it was not to be under ten sheets, and might\r\n  extend to twenty\" (Constable, ii. 318). Dugald Stewart, in a letter to\r\n  Constable, the 15th of November 1812, though he declines to engage to\r\n  execute any of his own suggestions, recommends that four discourses\r\n  should \"stand in front,\" forming \"a general map of the various\r\n  departments of human knowledge,\" similar to \"the excellent discourse\r\n  prefixed by D'Alembert to the French _Encyclopedie_,\" together with\r\n  historical sketches of the progress since Bacon's time of modern\r\n  discoveries in metaphysical, moral and political philosophy, in\r\n  mathematics and physics, in chemistry, and in zoology, botany and\r\n  mineralogy. He would only promise to undertake the general map and the\r\n  first historical sketch, if his health and other engagements\r\n  permitted, after the second volume of his _Philosophy of the Human\r\n  Mind_ (published in 1813) had gone to press. For the second he\r\n  recommended Playfair, for chemistry Sir Humphry Davy. He received\r\n  L1000 for the first part of his dissertation (166 pages), and L700 for\r\n  the second (257 pages), the right of publication being limited to the\r\n  Supplement and _Encyclopaedia_. Constable next contracted with\r\n  Professor Playfair for a dissertation \"to be equal in length or not to\r\n  Mr Stewart's, for L250; but a short time afterwards I felt that to pay\r\n  one eminent individual L1000 because he would not take less would be\r\n  quite unfair, and I wrote to the worthy Professor that I had fixed his\r\n  payment at L500.\" Constable gave him L500 for the first part (127\r\n  pages), and would have given as much for the second (90 pages) if it\r\n  had been as long. His next object was to find out the greatest defects\r\n  in the book, and he gave Professor Leslie L200 and Graham Dalyell L100\r\n  for looking over it. He then wrote out a prospectus and submitted it\r\n  in print to Stewart, \"but the cautious philosopher referred\" him to\r\n  Playfair, who \"returned it next day very greatly improved.\" For this\r\n  Constable sent him six dozen of very fine old sherry, only feeling\r\n  regret that he had nothing better to offer. He at first intended to\r\n  have two editors, \"one for the strictly literary and the other for the\r\n  scientific department.\" He applied to Dr Thomas Brown, who \"preferred\r\n  writing trash of poetry to useful and lucrative employment.\" At last\r\n  he fixed on Mr Macvey Napier (born 1777), whom he had known from 1798,\r\n  and who \"had been a hard student, and at college laid a good\r\n  foundation for his future career, though more perhaps in general\r\n  information than in what would be, strictly speaking, called\r\n  scholarship; this, however, does not fit him the less for his present\r\n  task.\" Constable, in a letter dated the 11th of June 1813, offered him\r\n  L300 before the first part went to press, L150 on the completion at\r\n  press of each of the eight half volumes, L500 if the work was\r\n  reprinted or extended beyond 7000 copies and L200 for incidental\r\n  expenses. \"In this way the composition of the four volumes, including\r\n  the introductory dissertations, will amount to considerably more than\r\n  L9000.\" In a postscript the certain payment is characteristically\r\n  increased to L1575, the contingent to L735, and the allowance for\r\n  incidental expenses to L300 (Constable, ii. 326). Napier went to\r\n  London, and obtained the co-operation of many literary men. The\r\n  supplement was published in half-volume parts from December 1816 to\r\n  April 1824. It formed six volumes 4to, containing 4933 pages, 125\r\n  plates, 9 maps, three dissertations and 669 articles, of which a list\r\n  is given at the end. The first dissertation, on the \"progress of\r\n  metaphysical, ethical and political philosophy,\" was by Stewart, who\r\n  completed his plan only in respect to metaphysics. He had thought it\r\n  would be easy to adapt the intellectual map or general survey of human\r\n  knowledge, sketched by Bacon and improved by D'Alembert, to the\r\n  advanced state of the sciences, while its unrivalled authority would\r\n  have softened criticism. But on closer examination he found the\r\n  logical views on which this systematic arrangement was based\r\n  essentially erroneous; and, doubting whether the time had come for a\r\n  successful repetition of this bold experiment, he forebore to\r\n  substitute a new scheme of his own. Sir James Mackintosh characterized\r\n  this discourse as \"the most splendid of Mr. Stewart's works, a\r\n  composition which no other living writer of English prose has\r\n  equalled\" (_Edinburgh Review_, xxvii. 191, September 1816). The second\r\n  dissertation, \"On the progress of mathematics and physics,\" was by\r\n  Playfair, who died 19th July 1819, when he had only finished the\r\n  period of Newton and Leibnitz. The third, by Professor Brande, \"On the\r\n  progress of chemistry from the early middle ages to 1800,\" was the\r\n  only one completed. These historical dissertations were admirable and\r\n  delightful compositions, and important and interesting additions to\r\n  the _Encyclopaedia_; but it is difficult to see why they should form a\r\n  separate department distinct from the general alphabet. The preface,\r\n  dated March 1824, begins with an account of the more important\r\n  previous encyclopaedias, relates the history of this to the sixth\r\n  edition, describes the preparation for the supplement and gives an\r\n  \"outline of the contents,\" and mentions under each great division of\r\n  knowledge the principal articles and their authors' names, often with\r\n  remarks on the characters of both. Among the distinguished\r\n  contributors were Leslie, Playfair, Ivory, Sir John Barrow, Tredgold,\r\n  Jeffrey, John Bird Sumner, Blanco White, Hamilton Smith and Hazlitt.\r\n  Sir Walter Scott, to gratify his generous friend Constable, laid aside\r\n  _Waverley_, which he was completing for publication, and in April and\r\n  May 1814 wrote \"Chivalry.\" He also wrote \"Drama\" in November 1818, and\r\n  \"Romance\" in the summer of 1823. As it seemed to the editor that\r\n  encyclopaedias had previously attended little to political philosophy,\r\n  he wrote \"Balance of Power,\" and procured from James Mill \"Banks for\r\n  Savings,\" \"Education,\" \"Law of Nations,\" \"Liberty of the Press,\" and\r\n  other articles, which, reprinted cheaply, had a wide circulation.\r\n  M'Culloch wrote \"Corn Laws,\" \"Interest,\" \"Money,\" \"Political Economy,\"\r\n  &c. Mr Ricardo wrote \"Commerce\" and \"Funding System,\" and Professor\r\n  Malthus, in his article \"Population,\" gave a comprehensive summary of\r\n  the facts and reasonings on which his theory rested. In the article\r\n  \"Egypt\" Dr Thomas Young \"first gave to the public an extended view of\r\n  the results of his successful interpretation of the hieroglyphic\r\n  characters on the stone of Rosetta,\" with a vocabulary of 221 words in\r\n  English, Coptic, Hieroglyphic and Enchorial, engraved on four plates.\r\n  There were about 160 biographies, chiefly of persons who had died\r\n  within the preceding 30 years. Constable \"wished short biographical\r\n  notices of the first founders of this great work, but they were, in\r\n  the opinion of my editor, too insignificant to entitle them to the\r\n  rank which such separate notice, it was supposed, would have given\r\n  them as literary men, although his own consequence in the world had\r\n  its origin in their exertions\" (_Memoirs_, ii. 326). It is to be\r\n  regretted that this wish was not carried out, as was done in the\r\n  latter volumes of Zedler. Arago wrote \"Double Refraction\" and\r\n  \"Polarization of Light,\" a note to which mentions his name as author.\r\n  Playfair wrote \"Aepinus,\" and \"Physical Astronomy.\" Biot wrote\r\n  \"Electricity\" and \"Pendulum.\" He \"gave his assistance with alacrity,\"\r\n  though his articles had to be translated. Signatures, on the plan of\r\n  the _Encyclopedie_, were annexed to each article, the list forming a\r\n  triple alphabet, A to XXX, with the full names of the 72 contributors\r\n  arranged apparently in the order of their first occurrence. At the end\r\n  of vol. vi. are Addenda and Corrigenda, including \"Interpolation,\" by\r\n  Leslie, and \"Polarization of Light,\" by Arago.\r\n\r\n  The sixth edition, \"revised, corrected and improved,\" appeared in\r\n  half-volume parts, price 16s. in boards, vol. xx. part ii. completing\r\n  the work in May 1823. Constable, thinking it not wise to reprint so\r\n  large a book year after year without correction, in 1820 selected Mr\r\n  Charles Maclaren (1782-1866), as editor. \"His attention was chiefly\r\n  directed to the historical and geographical articles. He was to keep\r\n  the press going, and have the whole completed in three years.\" He\r\n  wrote \"America,\" \"Greece,\" \"Troy,\" &c. Many of the large articles as\r\n  \"Agriculture,\" \"Chemistry,\" \"Conchology,\" were new or nearly so; and\r\n  references were given to the supplement. A new edition in 25 vols. was\r\n  contemplated, not to be announced till a certain time after the\r\n  supplement was finished; but Constable's house stopped payment on the\r\n  19th of January 1826, and his copyrights were sold by auction. Those\r\n  of the _Encyclopaedia_ were bought by contract, on the 16th of July\r\n  1828, for L6150, by Thomas Allan, proprietor of the _Caledonian\r\n  Mercury_, Adam Black, Abram Thomson, bookbinder, and Alexander Wight,\r\n  banker, who, with the trustee of Constable's estate, had previously\r\n  begun the seventh edition. Not many years later Mr Black purchased all\r\n  the shares and became sole proprietor.\r\n\r\n  The seventh edition, 21 vols. 4to (with an index of 187 pages,\r\n  compiled by Robert Cox), containing 17,101 pages and 506 plates,\r\n  edited by Macvey Napier, assisted by James Browne, LL.D., was begun in\r\n  1827, and published from March 1830 to January 1842. It was reset\r\n  throughout and stereotyped. Mathematical diagrams were printed in the\r\n  text from woodcuts. The first half of the preface was nearly that of\r\n  the supplement. The list of signatures, containing 167 names, consists\r\n  of four alphabets with additions, and differs altogether from that in\r\n  the supplement: many names are omitted, the order is changed and 103\r\n  are added. A list follows of over 300 articles, without signatures, by\r\n  87 writers. The dissertations--1st, Stewart's, 289 pages; 2nd,\r\n  \"Ethics\" (136 pages), by Sir James Mackintosh, whose death prevented\r\n  the addition of \"Political Philosophy\"; 3rd, Playfair's, 139 pages;\r\n  4th, its continuation by Sir John Leslie, 100 pages--and their index\r\n  of 30 pages, fill vol. i. As they did not include Greek philosophy,\r\n  \"Aristotle,\" \"Plato\" and \"Socrates\" were supplied by Dr Hampden,\r\n  afterwards bishop of Hereford. Among the numerous contributors of\r\n  eminence, mention may be made of Sir David Brewster, Prof. Phillips,\r\n  Prof. Spalding, John Hill Burton, Thomas De Quincey, Patrick Fraser\r\n  Tytler, Capt. Basil Hall, Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, Antonio Panizzi,\r\n  John Scott Russell and Robert Stephenson. Zoology was divided into 11\r\n  chief articles, \"Mammalia,\" \"Ornithology,\" \"Reptilia,\" \"Ichthyology,\"\r\n  \"Mollusca,\" \"Crustacea,\" \"Arachnides,\" \"Entomology,\" \"Helminthology,\"\r\n  \"Zoophytes,\" and \"Animalcule\"--all by James Wilson.\r\n\r\n  The eighth edition, 1853-1860, 4to, 21 vols. (and index of 239 pages,\r\n  1861), containing 17,957 pages and 402 plates, with many woodcuts, was\r\n  edited by Dr Thomas Stewart Traill, professor of medical jurisprudence\r\n  in Edinburgh University. The dissertations were reprinted, with one on\r\n  the \"Rise, Progress and Corruptions of Christianity\" (97 pages), by\r\n  Archbishop Whately, and a continuation of Leslie's to 1850, by\r\n  Professor James David Forbes, 198 pages, the work of nearly three\r\n  years, called by himself his \"magnum opus\" (Life, pp. 361, 366). Lord\r\n  Macaulay, Charles Kingsley, Isaac Taylor, Hepworth Dixon, Robert\r\n  Chambers, Rev. Charles Merivale, Rev. F.W. Farrar, Sir John\r\n  Richardson, Dr Scoresby, Dr Hooker, Henry Austin Layard, Edw. B.\r\n  Eastwick, John Crawfurd, Augustus Petermann, Baron Bunsen, Sir John\r\n  Herschel, Dr Lankester, Professors Owen, Rankine, William Thomson,\r\n  Aytoun, Blackie, Daniel Wilson and Jukes, were some of the many\r\n  eminent new contributors found among the 344 authors, of whom an\r\n  alphabetical list is given, with a key to the signatures. In the\r\n  preface a list of 279 articles by 189 writers, classed under 15 heads,\r\n  is given. This edition was not wholly reset like the seventh, but many\r\n  long articles were retained almost or entirely intact.\r\n\r\n  The publication of the ninth edition (A. & C. Black) was commenced in\r\n  January 1875, under the editorship of Thomas Spencer Baynes until\r\n  1880, and subsequently of W. Robertson Smith, and completed in 1889,\r\n  24 vols., with index. This great edition retained a certain amount of\r\n  the valuable material in the eighth, but was substantially a new work;\r\n  and it was universally acknowledged to stand in the forefront of the\r\n  scholarship of its time. Its contributors included the most\r\n  distinguished men of letters and of science. In 1898 a reprint, sold\r\n  at about half the original price, and on the plan of payment by\r\n  instalments, was issued by _The Times_ of London; and in 1902, under\r\n  the joint editorship of Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace, President Arthur\r\n  T. Hadley of Yale University, and Hugh Chisholm, eleven supplementary\r\n  volumes were published, forming, with the 24 vols. of the ninth\r\n  edition, a tenth edition of 35 volumes. These included a volume of\r\n  maps, and an elaborate index (vol. 35) to the whole edition,\r\n  comprising some 600,000 entries. In May 1903 a start was made with the\r\n  preparation of the 11th edition, under the general editorship of Hugh\r\n  Chisholm, with W. Alison Phillips as chief assistant-editor, and a\r\n  staff of editorial assistants, the whole work of organization being\r\n  conducted up to December 1909 from _The Times_ office. Arrangements\r\n  were then made by which the copyright and control of the\r\n  _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ passed to Cambridge University, for the\r\n  publication at the University Press in 1910-1911 of the 29 volumes\r\n  (one being Index) of the 11th edition, a distinctive feature of this\r\n  issue being the appearance of the whole series of volumes practically\r\n  at the same time.\r\n\r\nA new and enlarged edition of the _Encyclopedie_ arranged as a system of\r\nseparate dictionaries, and entitled _Encyclopedie methodique ou par ordre\r\nde matieres_, was undertaken by Charles Joseph Panckoucke, a publisher of\r\nParis (born at Lille on the 26th of November 1736, died on the 19th of\r\nDecember 1798). His privilege was dated the 20th of June 1780. The\r\narticles belonging to different subjects would readily form distinct\r\ndictionaries, although, having been constructed for an alphabetical plan,\r\nthey seemed unsuited for any system wholly methodical. Two copies of the\r\nbook and its supplement were cut up into articles, which were sorted into\r\nsubjects. The division adopted was: 1, mathematics; 2 physics; 3,\r\nmedicine; 4, anatomy and physiology; 5, surgery; 6, chemistry, metallurgy\r\nand pharmacy; 7, agriculture; 8, natural history of animals, in six\r\nparts; 9, botany; 10, minerals; 11, physical geography; 12, ancient and\r\nmodern geography; 13, antiquities; 14, history; 15, theology; 16,\r\nphilosophy; 17, metaphysics, logic and morality; 18, grammar and\r\nliterature; 19, law; 20, finance; 21, political economy; 22, commerce;\r\n23, marine; 24, art militaire; 25, beaux arts; 26, arts et metiers--all\r\nforming distinct dictionaries entrusted to different editors. The first\r\nobject of each editor was to exclude all articles belonging to other\r\nsubjects, and to take care that those of a doubtful nature should not be\r\nomitted by all. In some words (such as air, which belonged equally to\r\nchemistry, physics and medicine) the methodical arrangement has the\r\nunexpected effect of breaking up the single article into several widely\r\nseparated. Each dictionary was to have an introduction and a classified\r\ntable of the principal articles. History and its minor parts, as\r\ninscriptions, fables, medals, were to be included. Theology, which was\r\nneither complete, exact nor orthodox, was to be by the abbe Bergier,\r\nconfessor to Monsieur. The whole work was to be completed and connected\r\ntogether by a Vocabulaire Universel, 1 vol. 4to, with references to all\r\nthe places where each word occurred, and a very exact history of the\r\n_Encyclopedie_ and its editions by Panckoucke. The prospectus, issued\r\nearly in 1782, proposed three editions--84 vols. 8vo, 43 vols. 4to with 3\r\ncolumns to a page, and 53 vols. 4to of about 100 sheets with 2 columns to\r\na page, each edition having 7 vols. 4to of 250 to 300 plates each. The\r\nsubscription was to be 672 livres from the 15th of March to July 1782,\r\nthen 751, and 888 after April 1783. It was to be issued in livraisons of\r\n2 vols. each, the first (jurisprudence, vol. i., literature, vol. i.) to\r\nappear in July 1782, and the whole to be finished in 1787. The number of\r\nsubscribers, 4072, was so great that the subscription list of 672 livres\r\nwas closed on the 30th of April. Twenty-five printing offices were\r\nemployed, and in November 1782 the 1st livraison (jurisprudence, vol. i.,\r\nand half vol. each of arts et metiers and histoire naturelle) was issued.\r\nA Spanish prospectus was sent out, and obtained 330 Spanish subscribers,\r\nwith the inquisitor-general at their head. The complaints of the\r\nsubscribers and his own heavy advances, over 150,000 livres, induced\r\nPanckoucke, in November 1788, to appeal to the authors to finish the\r\nwork. Those _en retard_ made new contracts, giving their word of honour\r\nto put their parts to press in 1788, and to continue them without\r\ninterruption, so that Panckoucke hoped to finish the whole, including the\r\nvocabulary (4 or 5 vols.), in 1792. Whole sciences, as architecture,\r\nengineering, hunting, police, games, &c., had been overlooked in the\r\nprospectus; a new division was made in 44 parts, to contain 51\r\ndictionaries and about 124 vols. Permission was obtained on the 27th of\r\nFebruary 1789, to receive subscriptions for the separate dictionaries.\r\nTwo thousand subscribers were lost by the Revolution. The 50th livraison\r\nappeared on the 23rd of July 1792, when all the dictionaries eventually\r\npublished had been begun except seven--jeux familiers and mathematiques,\r\nphysics, art oratoire, physical geography, chasses and peches; and 18\r\nwere finished,--mathematics, games, surgery, ancient and modern\r\ngeography, history, theology, logic, grammar, jurisprudence, finance,\r\npolitical economy, commerce, marine, arts militaires, arts academiques,\r\narts et metiers, encyclopediana. Supplements were added to military art\r\nin 1797, and to history in 1807, but not to any of the other 16, though\r\nrequired for most long before 1832. The publication was continued by\r\nHenri Agasse, Panckoucke's son-in-law, from 1794 to 1813, and then by Mme\r\nAgasse, his widow, to 1832, when it was completed in 102 livraisons or\r\n337 parts, forming 166-1/2 vols. of text, and 51 parts containing 6439\r\nplates. The letterpress issued with the plates amounts to 5458 pages,\r\nmaking with the text 124,210 pages. To save expense the plates belonging\r\nto architecture were not published. Pharmacy (separated from chemistry),\r\nminerals, education, ponts et chaussees had been announced but were not\r\npublished, neither was the Vocabulaire Universel, the key and index to\r\nthe whole work, so that it is difficult to carry out any research or to\r\nfind all the articles on any subject. The original parts have been so\r\noften subdivided, and have been so added to by other dictionaries,\r\nsupplements and appendices, that, without going into great detail, an\r\nexact account cannot be given of the work, which contains 88 alphabets,\r\nwith 83 indexes, and 166 introductions, discourses, prefaces, &c. Many\r\ndictionaries have a classed index of articles; that of economie politique\r\nis very excellent, giving the contents of each article, so that any\r\npassage can be found easily. The largest dictionaries are medicine, 13\r\nvols., 10,330 pages; zoology, 7 dictionaries, 13,645 pages, 1206 plates;\r\nbotany, 12,002 pages, 1000 plates (34 only of cryptogamic plants);\r\ngeography, 3 dictionaries and 2 atlases, 9090 pages, 193 maps and plates;\r\njurisprudence (with police and municipalities), 10 vols., 7607 pages.\r\nAnatomy, 4 vols., 2866 pages, is not a dictionary but a series of\r\nsystematic treatises. Assemblee Nationale was to be in three parts,--(1)\r\nthe history of the Revolution, (2) debates, and (3) laws and decrees.\r\nOnly vol. ii., debates, appeared, 1792, 804 pages, Absens to Aurillac.\r\nTen volumes of a Spanish translation with a vol. of plates were published\r\nat Madrid to 1806--viz. historia natural, i. ii.; grammatica, i.; arte\r\nmilitar, i., ii.; geografia, i.-iii.; fabricas, i., ii., plates, vol. i.\r\nA French edition was printed at Padua, with the plates, says Peignot,\r\nvery carefully engraved. Probably no more unmanageable body of\r\ndictionaries has ever been published except Migne's _Encyclopedie\r\ntheologique_, Paris, 1844-1875, 4to, 168 vols., 101 dictionaries, 119,059\r\npages.\r\n\r\nNo work of reference has been more useful and successful, or more\r\nfrequently copied, imitated and translated, than that known as the\r\n_Conversations Lexikon_ of Brockhaus. It was begun as _Conversations\r\nLexikon mit vorzuglicher Rucksicht auf die gegenwartigen Zeiten_,\r\nLeipzig, 1796 to 1808, 8vo, 6 vols., 2762 pages, by Dr Gotthelf Renatus\r\nLobel (born on the 1st of April 1767 at Thalwitz near Wurzen in Saxony,\r\ndied on the 14th of February 1799), who intended to supersede Hubner,\r\nand included geography, history, and in part biography, besides\r\nmythology, philosophy, natural history, &c. Vols. i.-iv. (A to R)\r\nappeared 1796 to 1800, vol. v. in 1806. Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus\r\n(q.v.) bought the work with its copyright on the 25th of October 1808,\r\nfor 1800 thalers from the printer, who seems to have got it in payment\r\nof his bill. The editor, Christian Wilhelm Franke, by contract dated the\r\n16th of November, was to finish vol. vi. by the 5th of December, and the\r\nalready projected supplement, 2 vols., by Michaelmas 1809, for 8 thalers\r\na printed sheet. No penalty was specified, but, says his grandson,\r\nBrockhaus was to learn that such contracts, whether under penalty or\r\nnot, are not kept, for the supplement was finished only in 1811.\r\nBrockhaus issued a new impression as _Conversations Lexikon oder\r\nkurzgefasstes Handworterbuch_, &c, 1809-1811, and on removing to\r\nAltenburg in 1811 began himself to edit the 2nd edition (1812-1819, 10\r\nvols.), and, when vol. iv. was published, the 3rd (1814-1819). He\r\ncarried on both editions together until 1817, when he removed to\r\nLeipzig, and began the 4th edition as _Allgemeine deutsche\r\nRealencyclopadie fur die gebildeten Stande. Conversations Lexikon_. This\r\ntitle was, in the 14th edition, changed to that of _Brockhaus'\r\nKonversations Lexicon_. The 5th edition was at once begun, and was\r\nfinished in eighteen months. Dr Ludwig Hain assisted in editing the 4th\r\nand 5th editions until he left Leipzig in April 1820, when Professor\r\nF.C. Hasse took his place. The 12,000 copies of the 5th edition being\r\nexhausted while vol. x. was at press, a 2nd unaltered impression of\r\n10,000 was required in 1820 and a 3rd of 10,000 in 1822. The 6th\r\nedition, 10 vols., was begun in September 1822. Brockhaus died in 1823,\r\nand his two eldest sons, Friedrich and Heinrich, who carried on the\r\nbusiness for the heirs and became sole possessors in 1829, finished the\r\nedition with Hasse's assistance in September 1823. The 7th edition\r\n(1827-1829, 12 vols., 10,489 pages, 13,000 copies, 2nd impression\r\n14,000) was edited by Hasse. The 8th edition (1833-1836, 12 vols.,\r\n10,689 pages, 31,000 copies to 1842), begun in the autumn of 1832, ended\r\nMay 1837, was edited by Dr Karl August Espe (born February 1804, died in\r\nthe Irrenanstalt at Stotteritz near Leipzig on the 24th of November\r\n1850) with the aid of many learned and distinguished writers. A general\r\nindex, Universal Register, 242 pages, was added in 1839. The 9th edition\r\n(1843-1847, 15 vols., 11,470 pages, over 30,000 copies) was edited by Dr\r\nEspe. The 10th edition (1851-1855, 12,564 pages) was also in 15 vols.,\r\nfor convenience in reference, and was edited by Dr August Kurtzel aided\r\nby Oskar Pilz. Friedrich Brockhaus had retired in 1849; Dr Heinrich\r\nEdward, the elder son of Heinrich, made partner in 1854, assisted in\r\nthis edition, and Heinrich Rudolf, the younger son, partner since 1863,\r\nin the 11th (1864-1868, 15 vols. of 60 sheets, 13,366 pages).\r\n\r\n  Kurtzel died on the 24th of April 1871, and Pilz was sole editor until\r\n  March 1872, when Dr Gustav Stockmann joined, who was alone from April\r\n  until joined by Dr Karl Wippermann in October. Besides the Universal\r\n  Register of 136 pages and about 50,000 articles, each volume has an\r\n  index. The supplement, 2 vols, 1764 pages, was begun in February 1871,\r\n  and finished in April 1873. The 12th edition, begun in 1875, was\r\n  completed in 1879 in 15 vols., the 13th edition (1882-1887), in 16\r\n  vols., and the 14th (1901-1903) in 16 vols. with a supplementary\r\n  volume in 1904. The _Conversations Lexicon_ is intended, not for\r\n  scientific use, but to promote general mental improvement by giving\r\n  the results of research and discovery in a simple and popular form\r\n  without extended details. The articles, often too brief, are very\r\n  excellent and trustworthy, especially on German subjects, give\r\n  references to the best books, and include biographies of living men.\r\n\r\nOne of the best German encyclopaedias is that of Meyer, _Neues\r\nKonversations-Lexicon_. The first edition, in 37 vols., was published in\r\n1839-1852. The later editions, following closely the arrangement of\r\nBrockhaus, are the 4th (1885-1890, 17 vols.), the 5th (1894-1898, 18\r\nvols.), and the 6th (begun in 1902).\r\n\r\nThe most copious German encyclopaedia is Ersch and Gruber's _Allgemeine\r\nEncyklopadie der Wissenschaften und Kunste_, Leipzig. It was designed\r\nand begun in 1813 by Professor Johann Samuel Ersch (born at Gross Glogau\r\non the 23rd of June 1766, chief librarian at Halle, died on the 16th of\r\nJanuary 1828) to satisfy the wants of Germans, only in part supplied by\r\nforeign works. It was stopped by the war until 1816, when Professor\r\nHufeland (born at Danzig on the 19th of October 1760) joined, but he\r\ndied on the 25th of November 1817 while the specimen part was at press.\r\nThe editors of the different sections at various times have been some of\r\nthe best-known men of learning in Germany, including J.G. Gruber, M.H.E.\r\nMeier, Hermann Brockhaus, W. Muller and A.G. Hoffmann of Jena.\r\n\r\n  The work is divided into three sections (1) A-G, of which 99 vols. had\r\n  appeared by 1905, (2) H-N, 43 vols., (3) O-Z, 25 vols. All articles\r\n  bear the authors' names, and those not ready in time were placed at\r\n  the end of their letter. The longest in the work is Griechenland,\r\n  vols. 80-87, 3668 pages, with a table of contents. It began to appear\r\n  after vol. 73 (Gotze to Gondouin), and hence does not come in its\r\n  proper place, which is in vol. 91. Gross Britannien contains 700\r\n  pages, and Indien by Benfey 356.\r\n\r\nThe _Encyclopaedia Metropolitana_ (London, 1845, 4to, 28 vols., issued\r\nin 59 parts in 1817-1845, 22,426 pages, 565 plates) professed to give\r\nsciences and systematic arts entire and in their natural sequence, as\r\nshown in the introductory treatise on method by S.T. Coleridge. \"The\r\nplan was the proposal of the poet Coleridge, and it had at least enough\r\nof a poetical character to be eminently unpractical\" (_Quarterly\r\nReview_, cxiii., 379). However defective the plan, the excellence of\r\nmany of the treatises by Archbishop Whately, Sir John Herschel,\r\nProfessors Barlow, Peacock, de Morgan, &c., is undoubted. It is in four\r\ndivisions, the last only being alphabetical:--I. _Pure Sciences_, 2\r\nvols., 1813 pages, 16 plates, 28 treatises, includes grammar, law and\r\ntheology; II. _Mixed and Applied Sciences_, 8 vols., 5391 pages, 437\r\nplates, 42 treatises, including fine arts, useful arts, natural history\r\nand its \"application,\" the medical sciences; III. _History and\r\nBiography_, 5 vols., 4458 pages, 7 maps, containing biography (135\r\nessays) chronologically arranged (to Thomas Aquinas in vol. 3), and\r\ninterspersed with (210) chapters on history (to 1815), as the most\r\nphilosophical, interesting and natural form (but modern lives were so\r\nmany that the plan broke down, and a division of biography, to be in 2\r\nvols., was announced but not published); IV. _Miscellaneous_, 12 vols.,\r\n10,338 pages, 105 plates, including geography, a dictionary of English\r\n(the first form of Richardson's) and descriptive natural history. The\r\nindex, 364 pages, contains about 9000 articles. A re-issue in 38 vols.\r\n4to, was announced in 1849. Of a second edition 42 vols. 8vo, 14,744\r\npages, belonging to divisions i. to iii., were published in 1849-1858.\r\n\r\nThe very excellent and useful _English Cyclopaedia_ (London, 1854-1862,\r\n4to, 23 vols., 12,117 pages; supplements, 1869-1873, 4 vols., 2858\r\npages), conducted by Charles Knight, based on the _Penny Cyclopaedia_\r\n(London, 1833-1846, 4to, 29 vols., 15,625 pages), of which he had the\r\ncopyright, is in four divisions all alphabetical, and evidently very\r\nunequal as classes:--1, geography; 2, natural history; 3, biography\r\n(with 703 lives of living persons); 4, arts and sciences. The synoptical\r\nindex, 168 pages, has four columns on a page, one for each division, so\r\nthat the order is alphabetical and yet the words are classed.\r\n\r\n_Chambers's Encyclopaedia_ (Edinburgh, W. & R. Chambers), 1860-1868,\r\n8vo, 10 vols., 8283 pages, edited in part by the publishers, but under\r\nthe charge of Dr Andrew Findlater as \"acting editor\" throughout, was\r\nfounded on the 10th edition of _Brockhaus_. A revised edition appeared\r\nin 1874, 8320 pages. In the list of 126 contributors were J.H. Burton,\r\nEmmanuel Deutsch, Professor Goldstucker, &c. The index of matters not\r\nhaving special articles contained about 1500 headings. The articles were\r\ngenerally excellent, more especially on Jewish literature, folk-lore and\r\npractical science; but, as in _Brockhaus_, the scope of the work did not\r\nallow extended treatment. A further revision took place, and in\r\n1888-1892 an entirely new edition was published, in 10 vols., still\r\nfurther new editions being issued in 1895 and in 1901.\r\n\r\nAn excellent brief compilation, the _Harmsworth Encyclopaedia_ (1905),\r\nwas published in 40 fortnightly parts (sevenpence each) in England, and\r\nas _Nelson's Encyclopaedia_ (revised) in 12 vols. (1906) in America. It\r\nwas originally prepared for Messrs Nelson of Edinburgh and for the\r\nCarmelite Press, London.\r\n\r\nIn the United States various encyclopaedias have been published, but\r\nwithout rivalling there the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, the 9th edition\r\nof which was extensively pirated. Several American Supplements were also\r\nissued.\r\n\r\nThe _New American Cyclopaedia_, New York (Appleton & Co.), 1858-1863, 16\r\nvols., 12,752 pages, was the work of the editors, George Ripley and\r\nCharles Anderson Dana, and 364 contributors, chiefly American. A\r\nsupplementary work, the _American Annual Cyclopaedia_, a yearly 8vo vol.\r\nof about 800 pages and 250 articles, was started in 1861, but ceased in\r\n1902. In a new edition, the _American Cyclopaedia_, 1873-1876, 8vo, 16\r\nvols., 13,484 pages, by the same editors, 4 associate editors, 31\r\nrevisers and a librarian, each article passed through the hands of 6 or\r\n8 revisers.\r\n\r\nOther American encyclopaedias are Alvin J. Johnson's _New Universal\r\nCyclopaedia_, 1875-1877, in 4 vols., a new edition of which (excellently\r\nplanned) was published in 8 vols., 1893-1895, under the name of\r\n_Johnson's Universal Cyclopaedia_; the _Encyclopaedia Americana_, edited\r\nby Francis Lieber, which appeared in 1839-1847 in 14 vols.; a new work\r\nunder the same title, published in 1903-1904 in 16 vols.; the\r\n_International Cyclopaedia_, first published in 1884 (revised in 1891,\r\n1894 and 1898), and superseded in 1902 (revised, 1906) by the _New\r\nInternational Encyclopaedia_ in 17 vols.\r\n\r\n  In Europe a great impetus was given to the compilation of\r\n  encyclopaedias by the appearance of Brockhaus' _Conversations-Lexicon_\r\n  (see above), which, as a begetter of these works, must rank, in the\r\n  19th century, with the _Cyclopaedia_ of Ephraim Chambers in the 18th.\r\n  The following, although in no sense an exhaustive list, may be here\r\n  mentioned. In France, _Le Grand Dictionnaire universel du XIX^e\r\n  siecle_, of Pierre Larousse (15 vols., 1866-1876), with supplementary\r\n  volumes in 1877, 1887 and 1890; the _Nouveau Larousse illustre,\r\n  dictionnaire universel encyclopedique_ (7 vols., 1901-1904), (this is\r\n  in no way a re-issue or an abridgment of _Le Grand Dictionnaire_ of\r\n  Pierre Larousse); _La Grande Encyclopedie, inventaire raisonne des\r\n  sciences, des lettres, et des arts_, in 31 vols. (1886-1903). In\r\n  Italy, the _Nuova Enciclopedia Italiana_ (14 vols., 1841-1851, and in\r\n  25 vols., 1875-1888). In Spain, the _Diccionario enciclopedico\r\n  Hispano-Americano de litteratura, ciencias y artes_, published at\r\n  Barcelona (25 vols., 1877-1899). The Russian encyclopaedia, _Russkiy\r\n  Entsiklopedicheskiy Slovar_ (41 vols., 1905, 2 supplementary vols.,\r\n  1908) was begun in 1890 as a Russian version of Brockhaus'\r\n  _Conversations-Lexicon_, but has become a monumental encyclopaedia, to\r\n  which all the best Russian men of science and letters have\r\n  contributed. Elaborate encyclopaedias have also appeared in the\r\n  Polish, Hungarian, Bohemian and Rumanian languages. Of Scandinavian\r\n  encyclopaedias there have been re-issues of the _Nordesk\r\n  Conversations-Lexicon_, first published in 1858-1863, and of the\r\n  _Svenskt Conversations-Lexicon_, first published in 1845-1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDECOTT, JOHN (c. 1588-1665), English colonial governor in America, was\r\nborn probably at Dorchester, Dorsetshire, England, about 1588. Little is\r\nknown of him before 1628, when he was one of the six \"joint adventurers\"\r\nwho purchased from the Plymouth Company a strip of land about 60 m. wide\r\nalong the Massachusetts coast and extending westward to the Pacific\r\nOcean. By his associates Endecott was entrusted with the responsibility\r\nof leading the first colonists to the region, and with some sixty\r\npersons proceeded to Naumkeag (later Salem) where Roger Conant, a\r\nseceder from the colony at Plymouth, had begun a settlement two years\r\nearlier. Endecott experienced some trouble with the previous settlers\r\nand with Thomas Morton's settlement at \"Merry Mount\" (Mount Wollaston,\r\nnow Quincy), where, in accordance with his strict Puritanical tenets, he\r\ncut down the maypole and dispersed the merrymakers. He was the local\r\ngovernor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony from the 30th of April 1629 to\r\nthe 12th of June 1630, when John Winthrop, who had succeeded Matthew\r\nCradock as governor of the company on the 20th of October 1629, brought\r\nthe charter to Salem and became governor of the colony as well as of the\r\ncompany. In the years immediately following he continued to take a\r\nprominent part in the affairs of the colony, serving as an assistant and\r\nas a military commissioner, and commanding, although with little\r\nsuccess, an expedition against the Pequots in 1636. At Salem he was a\r\nmember of the congregation of Roger Williams, whom he resolutely\r\ndefended in his trouble with the New England clerical hierarchy, and\r\nexcited by Williams's teachings, cut the cross of St George from the\r\nEnglish flag in token of his hatred of all symbols of Romanism. He was\r\ndeputy-governor in 1641-1644, and governor in 1644-1645, and served also\r\nas sergeant-major-general (commander-in-chief) of the militia and as one\r\nof the commissioners of the United Colonies of New England, of which in\r\n1658 he was president. On the death of John Winthrop in 1649 he became\r\ngovernor, and by annual re-elections served continuously until his\r\ndeath, with the exception of two years (1650-1651 and 1654-1655), when\r\nhe was deputy-governor. Under his authority the colony of Massachusetts\r\nBay made rapid progress, and except in the matter of religious\r\nintolerance--he showed great bigotry and harshness, particularly towards\r\nthe Quakers--his rule was just and praiseworthy. Of him Edward Eggleston\r\nsays: \"A strange mixture of rashness, pious zeal, genial manners, hot\r\ntemper, and harsh bigotry, his extravagances supply the condiment of\r\nhumour to a very serious history--it is perhaps the principal debt\r\nposterity owes him.\" He died on the 15th of March 1665.\r\n\r\n  See C.M. Endicott, _Memoirs of John Endecott_ (Salem, 1847), and a\r\n  \"Memoir of John Endecott\" in _Antiquarian Papers_ of the American\r\n  Antiquarian Society (Worcester, Mass., 1879).\r\n\r\nA lineal descendant, WILLIAM CROWNINSHIELD ENDICOTT (1826-1900),\r\ngraduated at Harvard in 1847, was a justice of the Massachusetts supreme\r\ncourt in 1873-1882, and was secretary of war in President Cleveland's\r\ncabinet from 1885 to 1889. His daughter, Mary Crowninshield Endicott,\r\nwas married to the English statesman Mr Joseph Chamberlain in 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDIVE, _Cichorium Endivia_, an annual esculent plant of the natural\r\norder Compositae, commonly reputed to have been introduced into Europe\r\nfrom the East Indies, but, according to some authorities, more probably\r\nindigenous to Egypt. It has been cultivated in England for more than\r\nthree hundred years, and is mentioned by John Gerarde in his _Herbal_\r\n(1597). There are numerous varieties of the endive, forming two groups,\r\nnamely, the curled or narrow-leaved (var. _crispa_), and the Batavian or\r\nbroad-leaved (var. _latifolia_), the leaves of which are not curled. The\r\nformer varieties are those most used for salads, the latter being grown\r\nchiefly for culinary purposes. The plant requires a light, rich and dry\r\nsoil, in an unshaded situation. In the climate of England sowing for the\r\nmain crop should begin about the second or third week in June; but for\r\nplants required to be used young it may be as early as the latter half\r\nof April, and for winter crops up to the middle of August. The seed\r\nshould be finely spread in drills 4 in. asunder, and then lightly\r\ncovered. After reaching an inch in height the young plants are thinned;\r\nand when about a month old they may be placed out at distances of 12 or\r\n15 in., in drills 3 in. in depth, care being taken in removing them from\r\nthe seed-bed to disturb their roots as little as possible. The Batavian\r\nrequire more room than the curled-leaved varieties. Transplantation,\r\nwhere early crops are required, has been found inadvisable. Rapidity of\r\ngrowth is promoted by the application of liquid manures. The bleaching\r\nof endive, in order to prevent the development of the natural bitter\r\ntaste of the leaves, and to improve their appearance, is begun about\r\nthree months after the sowing, and is best effected either by tying the\r\nouter leaves around the inner, or, as in damp seasons, by the use of the\r\nbleaching-pot. The bleaching may be completed in ten days or so in\r\nsummer, but in winter it takes three or four weeks. For late crops,\r\nprotection from frost is requisite; and to secure fine winter endive, it\r\nhas been recommended to take up the full-grown plants in November, and\r\nto place them under shelter, in a soil of moderately dry sand or of\r\nhalf-decayed peat earth. Where forcing-houses are employed, endive may\r\nbe sown in January, so as to procure by the end of the following month\r\nplants ready for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDOEUS, an early sculptor, who worked at Athens in the middle of the\r\n6th century B.C. We are told that he made an image of Athena dedicated\r\nby Callias the contemporary of Pisistratus at Athens about 564 B.C. An\r\ninscription bearing his name has been found at Athens, written in Ionian\r\ndialect. The tradition which made him a pupil of Daedalus is apparently\r\nmisleading, since Daedalus had no connexion with Ionic art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDOGAMY (Gr. [Greek: endon], within, and [Greek: gamos], marriage),\r\nmarriage within the tribe or community, the term adopted to express the\r\ncustom compelling those of a tribe to marry among themselves. Endogamy\r\nwas probably characteristic of the very early stages of social\r\norganization (see FAMILY), and is to-day found only among races low in\r\nthe scale of civilization. As a custom it is believed to have been\r\npreceded in most lands by the far more general rule of Exogamy (q.v.).\r\nLord Avebury (_Origin of Civilisation_, p. 154) points out that \"there\r\nis not the opposition between exogamy and endogamy which Mr McLennan\r\nsupposed.\" Some races which are endogamous as regards the tribe are\r\nexogamous as regards the gens. Thus the Abors, Kochs, Hos and other\r\npeoples of India, are forbidden to marry out of the tribe; but the tribe\r\nitself is divided into \"keelis\" or clans, and no man is allowed to take\r\nas wife a girl of his own \"keeli\". Endogamy must have in most cases\r\narisen from racial pride, and a contempt, either well or ill founded,\r\nfor the surrounding peoples.\r\n\r\nAmong the Ahtena of Alaska, though the tribes are extremely militant and\r\nconstantly at war, the captured women are never made wives, but are used\r\nas slaves. Endogamy also prevails among tribes of Central America. With\r\nthe Yerkalas of southern India a custom prevails by which the first two\r\ndaughters of a family may be claimed by the maternal uncle as wives for\r\nhis sons. The value of a wife is fixed at twenty pagodas (a 16th-century\r\nIndian coin equivalent to about five shillings), and should the uncle\r\nforgo his claim he is entitled to share in the price paid for his\r\nnieces. Among some of the Karen tribes marriages between near relatives\r\nare usual. The Douignaks, a branch of the Chukmas, seem to have\r\npractised endogamy; and they \"abandoned the parent stem during the\r\nchiefship of Janubrix Khan about 1782. The reason of this split was a\r\ndisagreement on the subject of marriages. The chief passed an order that\r\nthe Douignaks should intermarry with the tribe in general. This was\r\ncontrary to an ancient custom and caused discontent and eventually a\r\nbreak in the tribe\" (Lewin's _Hill Tracts of Chittagong_, p. 65). This\r\nis interesting as being one of the few cases in which evidence of a\r\nchange in this respect is available. The Kalangs of Java are endogamous,\r\nand every man must first prove his common descent before he can enter a\r\nfamily. The Manchu Tatars prohibit those who have the same family names\r\nfrom marrying. Among the Bedouins \"a man has an exclusive right to the\r\nhand of his cousin.\" Hottentots seldom marry out of their own kraal, and\r\nDavid Livingstone quotes other examples. Endogamy seems to have existed\r\nin the Sandwich Islands and in New Zealand. A community of Javans near\r\nSurabaya, on the Teugger Hills, numbering about 1200 persons,\r\ndistributed in about forty villages, and still following the ancient\r\nHindu religion, is endogamous. Good examples of what biologists call\r\n\"in-and-in breeding\" are to be found in various fishing villages in\r\nGreat Britain, such as Itchinferry, near Southampton, Portland Island,\r\nBentham in Yorkshire, Mousehole and Newlyn in Mountsbay, Cornwall,\r\nBoulmer near Alnwick (where almost all the inhabitants are called\r\nStephenson, Stanton or Stewart), Burnmouth, Ross and (to some extent)\r\nEyemouth in Berwickshire, Boyndie in Banffshire, Rathen in\r\nAberdeenshire, Buckhaven in Fifeshire, Portmahomack and Balnabruach in\r\nEastern Ross. In France may be mentioned the commune of Batz, near Le\r\nBroisic in Loire-Inferieur, many of the central cantons of Bretagne, and\r\nthe singular society called Foreatines--supposed to be of Irish\r\ndescent--living between St Arnaud and Bourges. Many other European\r\nexamples might be mentioned, such as the Marans of Auvergne, a race of\r\nSpanish converted Jews accused of introducing syphilis into France; the\r\nBurins and Sermoyers, chiefly cattle-breeders, scattered over the\r\ndepartment of Ain and especially in the arrondissement of\r\nBourg-en-Bresse; the Vaqueros, shepherds in the Asturias Mountains; and\r\nthe Jewish Chuetas of Majorca.\r\n\r\n  See Gilbert Malcolm Sproat's _Scenes and Studies of Savage Life_;\r\n  Westermarck's _History of Human Marriage_ (1894); Lord Avebury's\r\n  _Origin of Civilisation_ (1902); J.F. McLennan's _Primitive Marriage_\r\n  (1865).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDOR, an ancient town of Palestine, chiefly memorable as the abode of\r\nthe sorceress whom Saul consulted on the eve of the battle of Gilboa, in\r\nwhich he perished (1 Sam. xxviii. 5-25). According to a psalmist (Ps.\r\nlxxxiii. 9) it was the scene of the rout of Jabin and Sisera. Although\r\nsituated in the territory of the tribe of Issachar, it was assigned to\r\nManasseh. In the time of Eusebius and Jerome Endor existed as a large\r\nvillage 5 m. south of Mount Tabor; there is still a poor village of the\r\nsame name on the slope of Jebel Dahi, near which are numerous caves.\r\n\r\n  For a description of the locality see Stanley, _Sinai and Palestine_,\r\n  p. 337.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDOSPORA, a natural group or class of the Sporozoa, consisting of the\r\norders Myxosporidia, Actinomyxidia, Sarcosporidia and Haplosporidia,\r\ntogether with various insufficiently-known forms (Sero- and\r\nExosporidia), regarded at present as Sporozoa _incertae sedis_. The\r\ndistinguishing feature of the group is that the spore-mother-cells\r\n(pansporoblasts) arise in the interior of the body of the\r\nparent-individual; in other words, sporulation is endogenous. Another\r\nvery general character--though not so universal--is that the adult\r\ntrophozoite possesses more than one nucleus, usually many (i.e. it is\r\nmultinucleate). In the majority of forms, though apparently not in all\r\n(e.g. certain Microsporidia), sporulation goes on coincidently with\r\ngrowth and trophic life. With regard to the origin of the group, the\r\nprobability is greatly in favour of a Rhizopod ancestry. The entire\r\nabsence, at any known period, of a flagellate or even gregariniform\r\nphase; on the other hand, the amoeboid nature of the trophozoites in\r\nvery many cases together with the formation of pseudopodia; and, lastly,\r\nthe simple endogenous spore-formation characteristic of the primitive\r\nforms,--are all points which support this view, and exclude any\r\nhypothesis of a Flagellate origin, such as, on the contrary, is probably\r\nthe case in the Ectospora (q.v.).\r\n\r\n1. Order Myxosporidia. The Myxosporidia, or, more correctly, the dense\r\nmasses formed by their spores, were well known to the earlier zoological\r\nobservers. The parasites in fishes were called by Muller\r\n\"fish-psorosperms,\" a name which has stuck to them ever since, although,\r\nas is evident from the meaning of the term (\"mange-seed\"), Muller had\r\nlittle idea of the true nature of the bodies. Other examples, infesting\r\nsilkworms, have also long been known as \"Pebrine-corpuscles,\" from the\r\nravaging disease which they produce in those caterpillars in France, in\r\nconnexion with which Pasteur did such valuable work. The foundation of\r\nour present morphological and biological knowledge of the order was well\r\nlaid by the admirable researches of Thelohan in 1895. In spite, however,\r\nof the contributions of numerous workers since then (e.g. Doflein, Cohn,\r\nStempell and others), there are still one or two very important points,\r\nsuch as the occurrence of sexual conjugation, upon which light is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Occurrence and habitat.\r\n\r\nAlthough pre-eminently parasites of fishes, Myxosporidia also occur, in a\r\nfew cases, in other Vertebrates (frogs and reptiles); no instance of their\r\npresence in a warm-blooded Vertebrate has, however, yet been described.\r\nOne suborder (the Microsporidia or Cryptocystes) is pretty equally\r\ndistributed between fishes on the one hand and Invertebrates--chiefly, but\r\nnot exclusively, Arthropods--on the other. The parasites are frequently\r\nthe cause of severe and fatal illness in their hosts, and devastating\r\nepidemics of myxosporidiosis have often been reported (e.g. among carp and\r\nbarbel in continental rivers, due to a _Myxobolus_, and among crayfish in\r\nFrance, to _Thelohania_).\r\n\r\nThe seat of the invasion and the mode of parasitism are extremely\r\nvaried. Practically any organ or tissue may be attacked, excepting,\r\napparently, the testis and cartilage and bone. In one instance at least\r\n(that of _Nosema bombycis_ of the silkworm) the parasites penetrate into\r\nthe ova, so that true hereditary infection occurs, the progeny being\r\nborn with the disease. The parasites may be either free in some lumen,\r\nsuch as that of the gall bladder or urinary bladder (not of the\r\nalimentary canal, or the body-cavity itself), when they are known as\r\n_coelozoic_ forms; or in intimate relation with some tissue,\r\nintracellular while young but becoming intercellular in the adult phase\r\n(_histozoic_ forms); or entirely intracellular (_cytozoic_ forms). Among\r\nthe histozoic and cytozoic types, moreover, two well-defined conditions,\r\n_concentration_ and _diffuse infiltration_, occur. In the former, the\r\nparasitic zone is strictly limited, and well-marked cysts are formed; in\r\nthe latter, the infection spreads throughout the neighbouring tissue,\r\nand the parasitic development becomes inextricably commingled with the\r\nhost's cells. Sometimes, as shown by Woodcock (45), there may be an\r\nattempt on the part of the host's tissue to circumscribe and check the\r\ngrowth of these parasitic areas, which results in the formation of\r\n_pseudocysts_, quite different in character from true cysts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Lankester's _Treatise on Zoology_, vol.

Pseudopodia of various kinds, from\r\nlong slender ones (fig. 3, B) to short blunt lobose ones, are of general\r\noccurrence, being most easily observed, of course, in the free-living\r\nforms. The pseudopodia serve chiefly for movement and attachment, and\r\nnever, it should be noted, for the injection of solid food-particles, as\r\nin the case of _Amoebae_. The general protoplasm is divisible into\r\nectoplasm and endoplasm. The former is a clear, finely-granular layer,\r\nof which the pseudopodia are mainly constituted (fig. 3, A). In one or\r\ntwo instances (e.g. _Myxidium lieberkuhnii_) the ectoplasm shows a\r\nvertical striation, and in the older trophozoites breaks down partially,\r\nappearing like a fur of delicate, non-motile filaments. A somewhat\r\nsimilar modification is found in _Myxocystis_. The endoplasm is more\r\nfluid, and contains numerous inclusions of a granular nature, as well as\r\nvacuoles of varying size. In the endoplasm are lodged the nuclei, of\r\nwhich in an adult trophozoite there may be very many; they are all\r\nderived by multiplication from the single nucleus with which the young\r\nindividuals begin life, the number increasing as growth proceeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Wasielewski, _Sporozoenkunde_.\r\n\r\nFIG. 3.--A.

The number of spores\r\nformed is very variable. It may be as low as two (as in free-living\r\nforms, _e.g._ _Leptotheca_), in which case a large amount of trophic\r\nprotoplasm is unconverted into spores; or, on the other hand, the number\r\nof spores may be very great (as in tissue-parasites), practically the\r\nwhole of the parent-body being thus used up. The sporont may or may not\r\nencyst at the commencement of sporulation. In the free-living forms\r\nthere is no cyst-membrane secreted; but in certain _Glugeidae_, on the\r\nother hand, the ectoplasm becomes altered into a firm, enclosing layer,\r\nthe _ectorind_, which forms a thick cyst-wall (fig. 5). The process of\r\nsporulation begins by the segregation of small quantities of endoplasm\r\naround certain of the nuclei, to form little, rounded bodies, the\r\n_pansporoblasts_. There may be either very many or only few\r\npansporoblasts developed; in some cases, indeed, there is only one, the\r\nsporont either itself becoming a pansporoblast (certain\r\n_Microsporidia_), or giving rise to a solitary one (_Ceratomyxidae_).\r\nThe pansporoblast constituted, nuclear multiplication goes on\r\npreparatory to the formation of sporoblasts, which in their turn become\r\nspores (see figs. 4 and 5). Not all the nuclei thus formed, however, are\r\nmade use of. In the _Phaenocystes_ there are always two sporoblasts\r\ndeveloped in each pansporoblast; in the _Cryptocystes_ there may be from\r\none to several. Around each sporoblast a spore-membrane is secreted,\r\nwhich usually has the form of two valves. It has recently been shown by\r\nLeger and Hesse (29b) that, in many Phaenocystes at any rate, each of\r\nthese valves is formed by a definite nucleated portion of the\r\nsporoblast.\r\n\r\nThe spores themselves vary greatly in size and shape (figs. 7 and 8).\r\nThey may be as small as 1.5 [mu] by 1 [mu] (as in a species of\r\n_Nosema_), or as large as 100 [mu] by 12 [mu] (as in _Ceratomyxa_). A\r\nconspicuous feature in the structure of a fully-developed spore is the\r\npolar-capsules, of which there may be either 1, 2, or 4 to each. In the\r\nPhaenocystes the polar-capsules are visible in the fresh condition, but\r\nnot in the Cryptocystes. The polar-capsule is an organella which recalls\r\nthe nematocyst of a Hydrozoan, containing a spirally-coiled filament,\r\noften of great length, which is shot out on the application of a\r\nsuitable stimulus. Normally, as was ingeniously shown by Thelohan (43),\r\nthe digestive juices of the fresh host serve this purpose, but various\r\nartificial means may suffice. The function of the everted filament is\r\nprobably to secure the attachment of the spore to the epithelium of the\r\nnew host. In the Phaenocystes, in connexion with each polar-capsule, a\r\nsmall nuclear body can be generally made out; these two little nuclei\r\nare those of the two \"capsulogenous\" areas of the protoplasm of the\r\npansporoblast, which formed the capsules. The sporoplasm, representing\r\nthe sporozoite, is always single. Nevertheless, in the Phaenocystes it\r\nis invariably binuclear; and, in the Microsporidia, the nucleus, at\r\nfirst single, gives rise later to four nuclei, two of which are regarded\r\nby Stempell (42) as corresponding to those of two polar-capsules (of\r\nwhich only one is developed in the spore), the remaining two\r\nrepresenting germ-nuclei. Hence it is possible that the Myxosporidian\r\nsporoplasm really consists of two, incompletely-divided (sister) germs.\r\nMoreover, it is supposed by some that these two nuclei fuse together\r\nlater, this act representing a sexual conjugation; since the earliest\r\nknown phases of young trophozoites (amoebulae) have been described as\r\nuninuclear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Lankester's _Treatise on Zoology_, vol.

One,\r\ntermed by Doflein _plasmotomy_, consists either in the division of the\r\n(multinucleate) trophozoite into two, by more or less equal fission\r\n(simple plasmotomy), or in the budding-off, from the parent trophozoite,\r\nof several portions (example: _Myxidium lieberkuhnii_, fig. 6). A\r\nvariety of this method has been described by Stempell (40) in the case\r\nof the young trophozoites (meronts) of _Thelohania mulleri_, which may\r\ndivide into two while still uninuclear; and by rapid successive\r\ndivisions chains of meronts may be formed, the different individuals\r\nbeing incompletely separated. Another method, which is probably chiefly\r\nresponsible for the rapid spread of tissue-parasites and cell-parasites\r\n(such as _Myxobolidae_ and _Glugeidae_) through their host's tissue in\r\nthe condition of diffuse infiltration, consists in multiple nuclear\r\ndivision, and the liberation of amoebulae while the parasite is yet\r\nquite young and possesses only few nuclei. As Woodcock has pointed out\r\nin considering the case of _Glugea stephani_, it is very probable that\r\nthis \"multiplicative reproduction,\" in diffuse infiltration, is to be\r\nlooked upon as a separation of the pansporoblast-rudiments as\r\ndaughter-individuals; i.e. that the pansporoblasts are, in certain\r\ncircumstances, capable of independent existence as little sporonts. A\r\nfurther stage in this direction of evolution is seen, according to\r\nStempell, in _Thelohania_, _Pleistophora_ and other types where the\r\nwhole individual becomes one reproductive organella; such forms are to\r\nbe considered as examples of a phylogenetic individualization of the\r\npansporoblasts, which now exist as solitary sporonts. An extreme case of\r\nthis \"reduction of the individual\" is found, apparently in the genus\r\n_Nosema_, as lately characterized by Perez (34), where vast numbers of\r\nminute entirely independent sporonts (pansporoblasts) are produced, each\r\nof which gives rise to only a single spore.\r\n\r\nThe Myxosporidia are divided into two suborders, the Phaenocystes and\r\nthe Cryptocystes. Some authors have of late years separated these two\r\ndivisions and raised each to the rank of a distinct order, considering\r\nthat they are not more closely related to each other than to other\r\nEndosporan orders. We think this is a mistake; and it is very\r\ninteresting to find that Leger and Hesse (1908) have described (29a) a\r\nnew genus of Phaenocystes, _Coccomyxa_, which represents a type\r\nintermediate between these two suborders, and shows that they are\r\nclosely connected.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Classification.\r\n\r\n  Suborder 1: _Phaenocystes_, Gurley. Spores relatively large, with\r\n  generally two or four polar-capsules, visible in the fresh condition.\r\n  There are nearly always two spores formed in each pansporoblast.\r\n\r\n  Section (a): _Disporea_. Only two spores (i.e. one pansporoblast)\r\n  produced in each individual trophozoite. The greatest length of the\r\n  spore is at right angles to the plane of the suture.\r\n\r\n  One family, _Ceratomyxidae_, including two genera, _Ceratomyxa_ (fig.\r\n  3, B) and _Leptotheca_, typically \"free\" parasites, mostly from the\r\n  gall bladders of fishes. The valves of the spore in the former genus\r\n  are prolonged into hollow cones. The type-species of this genus is _C.\r\n  sphaerulosa_, from _Mustelus_ and _Galeus_; that of _Leptotheca_ is\r\n  _L. agilis_, from _Trygon_.\r\n\r\n  Section (b): _Polysporea_. More than two spores, generally very many,\r\n  are produced typically by each individual trophozoite. The greatest\r\n  length of the spore is usually in the sutural plane.\r\n\r\n  Family, _Myxidiidae_. Spores with two polar-capsules, and without an\r\n  iodinophilous vacuole in the sporoplasm. Mostly \"free\" parasites.\r\n  Gen. _Sphaerospora_. Four or five species are known, from the kidneys\r\n  or gall bladder of fishes (fig. 3, A). One, _S. elegans_, is\r\n  interesting in that it affords a transition between the two sections,\r\n  being disporous. Gen. _Myxidium_; spores elongated and fusiform, with\r\n  a polar capsule at each extremity. The best-known species is _M.\r\n  lieberkuhnii_, from the urinary bladder of the pike. One or two\r\n  species occur in reptiles. Other genera are _Sphaeromyxa_,\r\n  _Cystodiscus_, _Myxosoma_ and _Myxoproteus_.\r\n\r\n  Family, _Chloromyxidae_. Spores with four polar capsules and no\r\n  iodinophilous vacuole. One genus, _Chloromyxum_, of which several\r\n  species are known; the type being _C. leydigi_, from the gall bladder\r\n  of various Elasmobranchs (fig. 7, B).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--A.

Spores with two polar-capsules (exceptionally\r\n  one), and with a characteristic iodinophilous vacuole in the\r\n  sporoplasm. Typically tissue parasites of Teleosteans, often very\r\n  dangerous. Genus _Myxobolus_. Spores oval or rounded, without a\r\n  tail-like process. Very many species are known, which are grouped into\r\n  three subsections: (a) forms with only one polar-capsule, such as _M.\r\n  piriformis_, of the tench; (b) forms with two unequal capsules, e.g.\r\n  _M. dispar_ from _Cyprinus_ and _Leuciscus_; and (c) the great\r\n  majority of species with two equal polar-capsules, including _M.\r\n  mulleri_, the type-species, from different fish, _M. cyprini_ and _M.\r\n  pfeifferi_, the cause of deadly disease in carp and barbel\r\n  respectively and others. Other genera are _Henneguya_ and\r\n  _Hoferellus_, differing from _Myxobolus_ in having, respectively, one\r\n  or two tail-like processes to the spore. _Lentospora_, according to\r\n  Plehn (37), lacks an iodinophilous vacuole.\r\n\r\n  Family _Coccomyxidae_. The pansporoblasts produce (probably) only one\r\n  spore. Spore oval, large (14 [mu] by 5.5 [mu]), with a single very\r\n  large polar-capsule. Sporoplasm with no vacuole. Single genus\r\n  _Coccomyxa_, with the characters of the family. One species, _C.\r\n  morovi_, Leger and Hesse, from the gall bladder of the sardine. The\r\n  spore greatly resembles a Cryptocystid spore.\r\n\r\n  Suborder 2: _Cryptocystes_, Gurley (= _Microsporidia_, Balbiani).\r\n  Spores minute, usually pear-shaped, with only one polar-capsule, which\r\n  is visible only after treatment with reagents. The number of spores\r\n  formed in each pansporoblast varies greatly in different forms.\r\n\r\n  Section (a): _Polysporogenea_. The trophozoite produces numerous\r\n  pansporoblasts, each of which gives rise to many spores. Genus\r\n  _Glugea_, with numerous species, of which the best-known is _G.\r\n  anomala_, from the stickleback (fig. 1). The genus _Myxocystis_, which\r\n  has been shown by Hesse (24) to be a true Microsporidian, is placed by\r\n  Perez in this section, but this is a little premature, as Hesse does\r\n  not describe the exact character of the sporulation, i.e. with regard\r\n  to the number of pansporoblasts and the spores they produce.\r\n\r\n  Section (b): _Oligosporogenea_. The trophozoite becomes itself the\r\n  (single) pansporoblast. In _Pleistophora_, the pansporoblast produces\r\n  many spores; _P. typicalis_, from the muscles of various fishes (fig.\r\n  2), is the type-species. In _Thelohania_, eight spores are formed;\r\n  the different species are parasitic in Crustacea. In _Gurleya_,\r\n  parasitic in _Daphnia_, only four are formed; and, lastly, in _Nosema_\r\n  (exs. _N. pulvis_, from _Carcinus_, and, most likely, _N. bombycis_,\r\n  of the silkworm), each pansporoblast produces only a single spore.\r\n\r\n2. Order--Actinomyxidia. This order comprises a peculiar group of\r\nparasites, first described by A. Stolc in 1899, which are restricted to\r\nOligochaete worms of the family _Tubificidae_. Most forms attack the\r\nintestinal wall, often destroying its epithelium over considerable\r\nareas; but one genus, _Sphaeractinomyxon_, inhabits the body-cavity of\r\nits host. The researches of Caullery and Mesnil (10-12) and of Leger (28\r\nand 29) have shown that the parasites exhibit the typical features of\r\nthe Endospora, and the spores possess the characteristic polar-capsules\r\nof the Myxosporidian spore, but differ therefrom by their more\r\ncomplicated structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Lankester's _Treatise on Zoology_, vol.

A noteworthy point is the differentiation of an external\r\n(covering) cellular layer, which affords, perhaps, the nearest approach\r\nto distinct tissue-formation known among Protozoa. This envelope is\r\nformed soon after nuclear multiplication of the young trophozoite has\r\nbegun, and is constituted by two nuclei and a thin, peripheral layer of\r\ncytoplasm. It remains binuclear throughout the entire period of\r\ndevelopment, and serves as a delicate cyst-membrane. The multiplication\r\nof the internal nuclei is accompanied by a corresponding division of the\r\ncytoplasm; so that instead of a multinucleate or plasmodial condition,\r\ndistinct uninucleate cellules are formed, up to sixteen in number. These\r\ncellules, as a matter of fact, are sexual elements or gametes; and eight\r\nof them can be distinguished from the other eight by slight differences\r\nin the nuclei. The gametes unite in couples, each couple being most\r\nprobably composed of dissimilar members: in other words, conjugation is\r\nslightly anisogamous. Each of these eight copulae gives rise to a spore.\r\n\r\nAs the name of the order implies, there are always eight spores formed.\r\nThese differ from other Endosporan spores in having invariably a ternary\r\nsymmetry and constitution (fig. 9). The wall of the spore is composed of\r\nthree valves, each formed from an enveloping cell, and three capsular\r\ncells, placed at the upper or anterior pole, and containing each a\r\npolar-capsule, visible in the fresh condition. The valves are usually\r\nprolonged into processes or appendages, whose form and arrangement\r\ncharacterize the genus; but in _Sphaeractinomyxon_ the spore is\r\nspherical and lacks processes. The sporoplasm may be either a plasmodial\r\nmass, with numerous nuclei, or may form a certain number of uninuclear\r\nsporozoites. A remarkable feature in the development of the spore is\r\nthat the germinal tissue (sporoplasm) arises separate from and outside\r\nthe cellules which give rise to the spore-wall; later, when the\r\nenvelopes are nearly developed, the sporoplasm penetrates into the\r\nspore.\r\n\r\n  Four genera have been made known. (1) _Hexactinomyxon_, Stolc. Spores\r\n  having the form of an anchor with six arms; sporoplasm plasmodial,\r\n  situate near the anterior pole of the spore. One sp. _H.\r\n  psammoryctis_, from _Psammoryctes_. (2) _Triactinomyxon_, St. Spores\r\n  having the form of an anchor with three arms; distinct sporozoites,\r\n  disposed near the anterior pole. _T. ignotum_, with eight spores, from\r\n  _Tubifex tubifex_, and also from an unspecified Tubificid; another\r\n  sp., unnamed, with 32 sporozoites, also from T. t.

(4) _Sphaeractinomyxon_, C. and M. Spores\r\n  spherical, without aliform prolongations; sporoplasm gives rise to\r\n  very many sporozoites, occupying the whole spore. One sp., _S.\r\n  st_olci, from _Clitellio_ and _Hemitubifex_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Lankester's _Treatise on Zoology_, vol.

Longitudinal section of a muscle-fibre containing a Sarcosporidian\r\nparasite, X 60.]\r\n\r\n3. Order--Sarcosporidia. With the exception of one or two forms\r\noccurring in reptiles, these parasites are always found in warm-blooded\r\nVertebrates, usually Mammals. They are of common occurrence in domestic\r\nanimals, such as pigs, sheep, horses and (sometimes) cattle. A\r\nSarcosporidian has also been described from man. The characteristic\r\nhabitat is the striped muscle, generally of the oesophagus (fig. 10, A)\r\nand heart, but in acute cases the parasites overrun the general\r\nmusculature. When this occurs, as often happens in mice, the result is\r\nusually fatal. Unless, however, the organisms thus spread throughout the\r\nbody, the host does not appear to suffer any serious consequences. In\r\naddition to the effects produced by the general disturbance to the\r\ntissues, the attacked animals have apparently to contend--at any rate in\r\nthe case of _Sarcocystis tenella_ in the sheep--with a poison secreted\r\nby the parasite. For Laveran and Mesnil (27) have isolated a toxine from\r\nthis form, which they have termed sarcocystin.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of growth, a Sarcosporidian appears as an elongated\r\nwhitish body lodged in the substance of a muscle-fibre; this phase has\r\nlong been known as a \"Miescher's tube,\" or _Miescheria_. The youngest\r\ntrophozoites that have been yet observed (by Bertram, 1) were\r\nmultinucleate (fig. 11, A), but there is no reason to doubt that they\r\nbegin life in a uninuclear condition. The protoplasm is limited by a\r\ndelicate cuticle. With growth, organellae corresponding to the\r\nMyxosporidian pansporoblasts are formed by the segregation internally of\r\nlittle uninuclear spheres of protoplasm. At the same time, a thick\r\nstriated envelope is developed around the parasite, which later comes to\r\nlook like a fur of fine filaments. The probable explanation of this\r\nfeature (given by Vuillemin, 44) is that it is due to the partial\r\nbreaking down of a stiff, vertically (or radially) striated external\r\nlayer (fig. 12, A), such as is seen in _Myxidium lieberkuhnii_.\r\nImmediately internal to this is a thin, homogeneous membrane, which\r\nsends numerous partitions or septa inwards; these divide up the\r\nendoplasm into somewhat angular chambers or alveoli (fig. 12). In each\r\nchamber is a pansporoblast, which divides up to produce many spores;\r\nhence the spores formed from different pansporoblasts are kept more or\r\nless separate. The pansporoblasts originate, in a growing\r\nSarcosporidian, at the two poles of the body, where the peripheral\r\nendoplasm with its nuclei is chiefly aggregated. More internally,\r\nspore-formation is in progress; and in the centre, pansporoblasts full\r\nof ripe spores are found.\r\n\r\nBy this time the parasite has greatly distended the muscle-fibre in\r\nwhich it has hitherto lain, absorbing, with its growth, practically all\r\nthe contractile-substance, until it is surrounded only by the sarcolemma\r\nand sarcoplasm. It next passes into the adjacent connective-tissue, and\r\nin this phase has been distinguished from _Miescheria_ as _Balbiania_,\r\nunder the impression that the two forms were quite distinct. In the\r\nlater stages, the parasite may become more rounded, and a cyst may be\r\nsecreted around it by the host's tissue. In these older forms, the most\r\ncentrally placed spores degenerate and die, having become over-ripe and\r\nstale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: After Bertram, from Wasielewski's _Sporozoenkunde_.\r\n\r\nFIG. 11.--Stages in the growth of _Sarcocystis tenella_ of the sheep. A,\r\nYoungest observed stage in which the radially striated outer coat has\r\nnot appeared; the body of the trophozoite is already divided into a\r\nnumber of cells or pansporoblasts (k). B and C, Older stages with\r\nnumerous pansporoblasts and two envelopes, an inner membrane and an\r\nouter radially striated layer.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the spores themselves and what becomes of them, our\r\nknowledge is defective. Two kinds of reproductive germ have been\r\ndescribed, termed respectively _gymnospores_ (so-called sporozoites,\r\n\"Rainey's corpuscles\") and _chlamydospores_, or simply spores. It seems\r\nprobable that the former serve for endogenous or auto-infection, and the\r\nlatter for infecting fresh hosts. Unfortunately, however, both kinds of\r\ngerm are not yet known in the case of any one species. The gymnospores,\r\nwhich are the more commonly found (e.g. in _S. muris_, _S. miescheriana_\r\nof the pig, and other forms), are small sickle-shaped or reniform\r\nbodies which are more or less amoeboid, and capable of active movement\r\nat certain temperatures. They appear to be naked, and consist of finely\r\ngranular protoplasm, containing a single nucleus and one or two\r\nvacuoles. The chlamydospores, or true spores, occur in _S. tenella_ of\r\nsheep (fig. 13), and have been described by Laveran and Mesnil (26).\r\nThey also are falciform, but one extremity is rounded, the other\r\npointed. There is a very thin, delicate membrane, most unlike a typical,\r\nresistant spore-wall; and the spores themselves are extremely fragile\r\nand easily acted upon and deformed by reagents, even by distilled water.\r\nThe rounded end of the spore contains a large nucleus, while at the\r\nother end is an oval, clear space, which, in the fresh condition, shows\r\na distinct spiral striation. The exact significance of this structure\r\nhas been much debated. In position and appearance it recalls the\r\npolar-capsule of a Myxosporidian spore. The proof of this interpretation\r\nwould be the expulsion of a filament on suitably stimulating the spore;\r\nwhile, however, some investigators have asserted that such a filament is\r\nextruded, this cannot be regarded as at all certain. Hence it is still\r\ndoubtful whether this striated body really corresponds to a\r\npolar-capsule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Wasielewski's _Sporozoenkunde_.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 12.--A, _Sarcocystis miescheriana_ (Kuhn) from the pig: late\r\nstage in which the body has become divided up into numerous chambers or\r\nalveoli, each containing a number of germs.\r\n\r\nB, _Sarcocystis_ of the ox: section of a stage similar to fig. 12. a,\r\nSubstance of muscle-fibre; b, envelope of parasite; c, nuclei of the\r\nmuscle; d, parasitic germs (gymnospores); e, walls of the alveoli.

Smith (39) showed that mice can be\r\ninfected with _Sarcocystis muris_ by simply feeding them on the flesh of\r\ninfected mice. It is not very likely, however, that this represents the\r\nnatural mode, even in the case of mice; and it certainly cannot do so in\r\nthe case of Herbivora. The difficulty in the way is the delicacy of the\r\nspores, which seem totally unfitted to withstand external conditions. It\r\nmay be that some alternative (intermediate) host is concerned in\r\ndispersal; but this has yet to be ascertained.\r\n\r\n  All known Sarcosporidia are included in a single genus _Sarcocystis_,\r\n  Lank. (= _Miescheria_ + _Balbiania_, Blanchard.) Some of the principal\r\n  species are: _S. miescheriana_, from pigs; _S. tenella_, from sheep;\r\n  _S. bertrami_, from horses; _S. blanchardi_, from Bovines; _S. muris_,\r\n  from mice; _S. platydactyli_, from the gecko; and lastly, _S.\r\n  lindemanni_, described from man.\r\n\r\n4. Order--Haplosporidia. The Sporozoa included in this order are\r\ncharacterized by the general simplicity of their development, and by the\r\nundifferentiated character of their spores. The order includes a good\r\nmany forms, whose arrangement and classification have been recently\r\nundertaken by Caullery and Mesnil (15), to whom, indeed, most of our\r\nknowledge relating to the Haplosporidia is due. The habitat of the\r\nparasites is sufficiently varied; Rotifers, Crustacea, Annelids and\r\nfishes furnishing most of the hosts. A recent addition to the list of\r\nProtozoa causing injury to man, a Haplosporidian, has been described by\r\nMinchin and Fantham (29d), who have termed the parasite\r\n_Rhinosporidium_, from its habitat in the nasal septum, where it\r\nproduces pedunculate tumours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Minchin, in Lankester's _Treatise on Zoology_, vol.\r\nProtozoa.\r\n\r\nFIG. 14.--_Bertramia Asperospora_ (Fritsch) from the body-cavity of\r\n_Brachionus_.

The trophozoite begins life as a small,\r\nrounded uninucleate corpuscle, which as it grows, becomes multinucleate.\r\nThe multinuclear body generally assumes a definite shape, often that of\r\na sausage. Later, the protoplasm becomes segregated around each of the\r\nnuclei, giving the parasite a mulberry-like aspect; hence this stage is\r\nfrequently known as a morula. The uninuclear cellules thus formed are\r\nthe spores, which are ultimately liberated by the break-up of the parent\r\nbody. Each is of quite simple, undifferentiated structure, possesses a\r\nlarge, easily-visible nucleus, and gives rise in due course to another\r\nyoung trophozoite. In some instances, as described by Minchin, the\r\nsporulating parasite becomes rounded off and forms a protective cyst,\r\ndoubtless for the protection of the spores during dissemination.\r\n\r\nIn some forms (e.g. _Haplosporidium_ and _Rhinosporidium_) the\r\nspore-mother-cells, instead of becoming each a single spore, as in\r\n_Bertramia_, give rise to several, four in the first case, many in the\r\nlatter. Sometimes, again, the spore, while preserving the essentially\r\nsimple character of the sporoplasm, may be enclosed in a spore-case;\r\nthis may have the form of a little box with a lid or operculum, as in\r\nsome species of _Haplosporidium_, or may possess a long process or tail,\r\nas in _Urosporidium_ (fig. 15).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Caullery and Mesnil, _Archives de zoologie\r\n  experimentale_, vol. 4, 1905, by permission of Schleicher Freres et\r\n  Cie, Paris.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 15.--Spores of various Haplosporidia.\r\n\r\n    1. _Haplosporidium heterocirri_:\r\n      a, on liberation;\r\n      b, after being in sea-water.\r\n    2, _H. scolopli_.\r\n    3, _H. vejdovskii_.\r\n    4, _Urosporidium fuliginosum_:\r\n      a, surface-view;\r\n      b, side-view. X 1000.]\r\n\r\n  The _Haplosporidia_ are divided by Caullery and Mesnil into three\r\n  families, _Haplosporidiidae_, _Bertramiidae_ and _Coelosporidiidae_;\r\n  one or two genera are also included whose exact position is doubtful.\r\n\r\n  (a) _Haplosporidiidae_: 3 genera, _Haplosporidium_, type-species _H.\r\n  heterocirri_; _Urosporidium_, with one sp., _U. fuliginosum_; all\r\n  parasitic in various Annelids; and _Anurosporidium_, with the species\r\n  _A. pelseneeri_, from the sporocysts of a Trematode, parasitic on\r\n  _Donax_.\r\n\r\n  (b) _Bertramiidae_: 2 genera, _Bertramia_, with _B. capitellae_ from\r\n  an Annelid and _B. asperospora_, the Rotiferan parasite above\r\n  described; and _Ichthyosporidium_, with _I. gasterophilum_ and _I.\r\n  phymogenes_, parasitic in various fish.\r\n\r\n  (c) _Coelosporidiiae_: genera _Coelosporidium_, type-species _C.\r\n  chydoriclola_; and _Polycaryum_, type-species _P. branchiopodianum_.\r\n  These forms are parasitic in small Crustacea. The genus _Blastulidium_\r\n  is referred, doubtfully, by Caullery and Mesnil to this family; but\r\n  certain phases of this organism seem to indicate rather a vegetable\r\n  nature.\r\n\r\n  The genus _Rhinosporidium_ should probably be placed in a distinct\r\n  family. The only species so far described is _R. kinealyi_ from the\r\n  nasal septum of man, to which reference has above been made. Another\r\n  form, _Neurosporidium cephalodisci_, agreeing in some respects with\r\n  _Rhinosporidium_, has been described by Ridewood and Fantham (37a)\r\n  from the nervous system of _Cephalodiscus_.\r\n\r\n  A parasite whose affinities are doubtful, but which is regarded by\r\n  Caullery and Mesnil as allied to the Haplosporidia, is the curious\r\n  parasite originally described by Schewiakoff as \"endoparasitic tubes\"\r\n  of _Cyclops_; it has been named by Caullery and Mesnil,\r\n  _Scheviakovella_. This organism is remarkable in one or two ways: it\r\n  possesses a contractile vacuole; the amoeboid trophozoites tend to\r\n  form plasmodia; and the spores, of the usual simple type, may\r\n  apparently divide by binary fission.\r\n\r\n5. There remain, lastly, certain forms, which are conveniently grouped\r\ntogether as \"Sporozoa _incertae sedis_,\" either for the reason that it\r\nis impossible to place them in any of the well-defined orders, or\r\nbecause their life-cycle is at present too insufficiently known.\r\nSerosporidia is the name given by Pfeiffer to certain minute parasites\r\nof the body-cavity of Crustacea; they include _Serosporidium_,\r\n_Blanchardina_ and _Botellus_. _Lymphosporidium_, a form with\r\ndistributed nucleus, causing virulent epidemics among brook-trout, is\r\nconsidered by Calkins(3) to be suitably placed here. Another parasite of\r\nlymphatic spaces and channels is the remarkable _Lymphocystis_,\r\ndescribed by Woodcock (46), from plaice and flounders, which in some\r\nrespects rather recalls a Gregarine. The group Exosporidia was founded\r\nby Perrier to include a peculiar organism, ectoparasitic on Arthropods,\r\nto which the name of _Amoebidium_ had been given by Cienkowsky. It has\r\nrecently been shown, however, that this organism is most probably an\r\nAlga. Another genus, _Exosporidium_, described by Sand (38), is placed\r\nat present in this group. For details of the structure of these forms\r\nand others like _Siedleckia_, _Toxosporidium_, _Chitonicium_\r\n_Joyeuxella_ and _Metschnikovella_, a comprehensive treatise on the\r\nSporozoa, such as that of Minchin, should be consulted.\r\n\r\nTo complete this article, it will be sufficient to mention various\r\nenigmatical bodies, associated with different diseases, which are\r\nregarded by their describers as Protozoa. Among such is the\r\n\"_Histosporidium carcinomatosum_\" of Feinberg, which he finds in\r\ncancerous growths. _Cytoryctes_, the name given to \"Guarnieri's bodies\"\r\nin small-pox and vaccinia, has been recently investigated by Calkins\r\n(3a), who has described a complex life-cycle for the alleged parasite.\r\nOther workers, however, such as Siegel, give a quite different account\r\nof these bodies, and, moreover, find similar ones in scarlet-fever,\r\nsyphilis, &c.; while yet others (e.g. Prowazek) deny that they are\r\nparasitic organisms at all.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--(For general works see under SPOROZOA.)

Wo.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDYMION, in Greek mythology, son of Aethlius and king of Elis. He was\r\nloved by Selene, goddess of the moon, by whom he had fifty daughters,\r\nsupposed to represent the fifty moons of the Olympian festal cycle. In\r\nother versions, Endymion was a beautiful youth, a shepherd or hunter\r\nwhom Selene visited every night while he lay asleep in a cave on Mount\r\nLatmus in Caria (Pausanias v. 1; Ovid, _Ars am._ iii. 83). Zeus left him\r\nfree to choose anything he might desire, and he chose an everlasting\r\nsleep, in which he might remain youthful for ever (Apollodorus i. 7).\r\nAccording to others, Endymion's eternal sleep was a punishment inflicted\r\nby Zeus upon him because he ventured to fall in love with Hera, when he\r\nwas admitted to the society of the Olympian gods (Schol. Theocritus iii.\r\n49). The usual form of the legend, however, represents Endymion as\r\nhaving been put to sleep by Selene herself in order that she might enjoy\r\nhis society undisturbed (Cicero, _Tusc. disp._ i. 38). Some see in\r\nEndymion the sun, setting opposite to the rising moon, the Latmian cave\r\nbeing the cave of forgetfulness, into which the sun plunges beneath the\r\nsea; others regard him as the personification of sleep or death (see\r\nMayor on Juvenal x. 318).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENERGETICS. The most fundamental result attained by the progress of\r\nphysical science in the 19th century was the definite enunciation and\r\ndevelopment of the doctrine of energy, which is now paramount both in\r\nmechanics and in thermodynamics. For a discussion of the elementary\r\nideas underlying this conception see the separate heading ENERGY.\r\n\r\nEver since physical speculation began in the atomic theories of the\r\nGreeks, its main problem has been that of unravelling the nature of the\r\nunderlying correlation which binds together the various natural\r\nagencies. But it is only in recent times that scientific investigation\r\nhas definitely established that there is a quantitative relation of\r\nsimple equivalence between them, whereby each is expressible in terms of\r\nheat or mechanical power; that there is a certain measurable quantity\r\nassociated with each type of physical activity which is always\r\nnumerically identical with a corresponding quantity belonging to the new\r\ntype into which it is transformed, so that the energy, as it is called,\r\nis conserved in unaltered amount. The main obstacle in the way of an\r\nearlier recognition and development of this principle had been the\r\ndoctrine of caloric, which was suggested by the principles and practice\r\nof calorimetry, and taught that heat is a substance that can be\r\ntransferred from one body to another, but cannot be created or\r\ndestroyed, though it may become latent. So long as this idea maintained\r\nitself, there was no possible compensation for the destruction of\r\nmechanical power by friction; it appeared that mechanical effect had\r\nthere definitely been lost. The idea that heat is itself convertible\r\ninto power, and is in fact energy of motion of the minute invisible\r\nparts of bodies, had been held by Newton and in a vaguer sense by Bacon,\r\nand indeed long before their time; but it dropped out of the ordinary\r\ncreed of science in the following century. It held a place, like many\r\nother anticipations of subsequent discovery, in the system of Natural\r\nPhilosophy of Thomas Young (1804); and the discrepancies attending\r\ncurrent explanations on the caloric theory were insisted on, about the\r\nsame time, by Count Rumford and Sir H. Davy. But it was not till the\r\nactual experiments of Joule verified the same exact equivalence between\r\nheat produced and mechanical energy destroyed, by whatever process that\r\nwas accomplished, that the idea of caloric had to be definitely\r\nabandoned. Some time previously R. Mayer, physician, of Heilbronn, had\r\nfounded a weighty theoretical argument on the production of mechanical\r\npower in the animal system from the food consumed; he had, moreover,\r\neven calculated the value of a unit of heat, in terms of its equivalent\r\nin power, from the data afforded by Regnault's determinations of the\r\nspecific heats of air at constant pressure and at constant volume, the\r\nformer being the greater on Mayer's hypothesis (of which his calculation\r\nin fact constituted the verification) solely on account of the power\r\nrequired for the work of expansion of the gas against the surrounding\r\nconstant pressure. About the same time Helmholtz, in his early memoir on\r\nthe Conservation of Energy, constructed a cumulative argument by tracing\r\nthe ramifications of the principle of conservation of energy throughout\r\nthe whole range of physical science.\r\n\r\n_Mechanical and Thermal Energy._--The amount of energy, defined in this\r\nsense by convertibility with mechanical work, which is contained in a\r\nmaterial system, must be a function of its physical state and chemical\r\nconstitution and of its temperature. The change in this amount, arising\r\nfrom a given transformation in the system, is usually measured by\r\ndegrading the energy that leaves the system into heat; for it is always\r\npossible to do this, while the conversion of heat back again into other\r\nforms of energy is impossible without assistance, taking the form of\r\ncompensating degradation elsewhere. We may adopt the provisional view\r\nwhich is the basis of abstract physics, that all these other forms of\r\nenergy are in their essence mechanical, that is, arise from the motion\r\nor strain of material or ethereal media; then their distinction from\r\nheat will lie in the fact that these motions or strains are simply\r\nco-ordinated, so that they can be traced and controlled or manipulated\r\nin detail, while the thermal energy subsists in irregular motions of the\r\nmolecules or smallest portions of matter, which we cannot trace on\r\naccount of the bluntness of our sensual perceptions, but can only\r\nmeasure as regards total amount.\r\n\r\n_Historical: Abstract Dynamics._--Even in the case of a purely\r\nmechanical system, capable only of a finite number of definite types of\r\ndisturbance, the principle of the conservation of energy is very far\r\nfrom giving a complete account of its motions; it forms only one among\r\nthe equations that are required to determine their course. In its\r\napplication to the kinetics of invariable systems, after the time of\r\nNewton, the principle was emphasized as fundamental by Leibnitz, was\r\nthen improved and generalized by the Bernoullis and by Euler, and was\r\nultimately expressed in its widest form by Lagrange. It is recorded by\r\nHelmholtz that it was largely his acquaintance in early years with the\r\nworks of those mathematical physicists of the previous century, who had\r\nformulated and generalized the principle as a help towards the\r\ntheoretical dynamics of complex systems of masses, that started him on\r\nthe track of extending the principle throughout the whole range of\r\nnatural phenomena. On the other hand, the ascertained validity of this\r\nextension to new types of phenomena, such as those of electrodynamics,\r\nnow forms a main foundation of our belief in a mechanical basis for\r\nthese sciences.\r\n\r\nIn the hands of Lagrange the mathematical expression for the manner in\r\nwhich the energy is connected with the geometrical constitution of the\r\nmaterial system became a sufficient basis for a complete knowledge of\r\nits dynamical phenomena. So far as statics was concerned, this doctrine\r\ntook its rise as far back as Galileo, who recognized in the simpler\r\ncases that the work expended in the steady driving of a frictionless\r\nmechanical system is equal to its output. The expression of this fact\r\nwas generalized in a brief statement by Newton in the _Principia_, and\r\nmore in detail by the Bernoullis, until, in the analytical guise of the\r\nso-called principle of \"virtual velocities\" or virtual work, it finally\r\nbecame the basis of Lagrange's general formulation of dynamics. In its\r\napplication to kinetics a purely physical principle, also indicated by\r\nNewton, but developed long after with masterly applications by\r\nd'Alembert, that the reactions of the infinitesimal parts of the system\r\nagainst the accelerations of their motions statically equilibrate the\r\nforces applied to the system as a whole, was required in order to form a\r\nsufficient basis, and one which Lagrange soon afterwards condensed into\r\nthe single relation of Least Action. As a matter of history, however,\r\nthe complete formulation of the subject of abstract dynamics actually\r\narose (in 1758) from Lagrange's precise demonstration of the principle\r\nof Least Action for a particle, and its immediate extension, on the\r\nbasis of his new Calculus of Variations, to a system of connected\r\nparticles such as might be taken as a representation of any material\r\nsystem; but here too the same physical as distinct from mechanical\r\nconsiderations come into play as in d'Alembert's principle. (See\r\nDYNAMICS: _Analytical_.)\r\n\r\nIt is in the cases of systems whose state is changing so slowly that\r\nreactions arising from changing motions can be neglected, that the\r\nconditions are by far the simplest. In such systems, whether stationary\r\nor in a state of steady motion, the energy depends on the configuration\r\nalone, and its mathematical expression can be determined from\r\nmeasurement of the work required for a sufficient number of simple\r\ntransformations; once it is thus found, all the statical relations of\r\nthe system are implicitly determined along with it, and the results of\r\nall other transformations can be predicted. The general development of\r\nsuch relations is conveniently classed as a separate branch of physics\r\nunder the name _Energetics_, first invented by W.J.M. Rankine; but the\r\nessential limitations of this method have not always been observed. As\r\nregards statical change, the complete specification of a mechanical\r\nsystem is involved in its geometrical configuration and the function\r\nexpressing its mechanical energy in terms thereof. Systems which have\r\nstatical energy-functions of the same analytical form behave in\r\ncorresponding ways, and can serve as models or representations of one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n_Extension to Thermal and Chemical Systems._--This dominant position of\r\nthe principle of energy, in ordinary statical problems, has in recent\r\ntimes been extended to transformations involving change of physical\r\nstate or chemical constitution as well as change of geometrical\r\nconfiguration. In this wider field we cannot assert that mechanical (or\r\navailable) energy is never lost, for it may be degraded into thermal\r\nenergy; but we can use the principle that on the other hand it can never\r\nspontaneously increase. If this were not so, cyclic processes might\r\ntheoretically be arranged which would continue to supply mechanical\r\npower so long as energy of any kind remained in the system; whereas the\r\nirregular and uncontrollable character of the molecular motions and\r\nstrains which constitute thermal energy, in combination with the vast\r\nnumber of the molecules, must place an effectual bar on their unlimited\r\nco-ordination. To establish a doctrine of _energetics_ that shall form a\r\nsufficient foundation for a theory of the trend of chemical and physical\r\nchange, we have, therefore, to impart precision to this motion of\r\navailable energy.\r\n\r\n_Carnot's Principle: Entropy._--The whole subject is involved in the new\r\nprinciple contributed to theoretical physics by Sadi Carnot in 1824, in\r\nwhich the far-reaching modern conception of cyclic processes was first\r\nscientifically developed. It was shown by Carnot, on the basis of certain\r\naxioms, whose theoretical foundations were subsequently corrected and\r\nstrengthened by Clausius and Lord Kelvin, that a reversible mechanical\r\nprocess, working in a cycle by means of thermal transfers, which takes\r\nheat, say H1, into the material system at a given temperature T1, and\r\ndelivers the part of it not utilized, say H2, at a lower given\r\ntemperature T2, is more efficient, considered as a working engine, than\r\nany other such process, operating between the same two temperatures but\r\nnot reversible, could be. This relation of inequality involves a definite\r\nlaw of equality, that the mechanical efficiencies of all reversible\r\ncyclic processes are the same, whatever be the nature of their operation\r\nor the material substances involved in them; that in fact the efficiency\r\nis a function solely of the two temperatures at which the cyclically\r\nworking system takes in and gives out heat. These considerations\r\nconstitute a fundamental general principle to which all possible slow\r\nreversible processes, so far as they concern matter in bulk, must conform\r\nin all their stages; its application is almost coextensive with the scope\r\nof general physics, the special kinetic theories in which inertia is\r\ninvolved, being excepted. (See THERMODYNAMICS.) If the working system is\r\nan ideal gas-engine, in which a perfect gas (known from experience to be\r\na possible state of matter) is passed through the cycle, and if\r\ntemperature is measured from the absolute zero by the expansion of this\r\ngas, then simple direct calculation on the basis of the laws of ideal\r\ngases shows that H1/T1 = H2/T2; and as by the conservation of energy the\r\nwork done is H1 - H2, it follows that the efficiency, measured as the\r\nratio of the work done to the supply of heat, is 1 - T2/T1. If we change\r\nthe sign of H1 and thus consider heat as positive when it is restored to\r\nthe system as is H2, the fundamental equation becomes H1/T1 + H2/T2 = 0;\r\nand as any complex reversible working system may be considered as\r\ncompounded in various ways of chains of elementary systems of this type,\r\n_whose effects are additive_, the general proposition follows, that in\r\nany reversible complete cyclic change which involves the taking in of\r\nheat by the system of which the amount is [delta]H, when its temperature\r\nranges between T_r and T_r + [delta]T, the equation [Sigma][delta]H_r/T_r\r\n- 0 holds good. Moreover, if the changes are not reversible, the\r\nproportion of the heat supply that is utilized for mechanical work will\r\nbe smaller, so that more heat will be restored to the system, and\r\n[Sigma][delta]H_r/T_r or, as it may be expressed, [int]dH/T, must have a\r\nlarger value, and must thus be positive. The first statement involves\r\nfurther, that for all reversible paths of change of the system from one\r\nstate C to another state D, the value of [int]dH/T must be the same,\r\nbecause any one of these paths and any other one reversed would form a\r\ncycle; whereas for any irreversible path of change between the same\r\nstates this integral must have a greater value (and so exceed the\r\ndifference of entropies at the ends of the path). The definite quantity\r\nrepresented by this integral for a reversible path was introduced by\r\nClausius in 1854 (also adumbrated by Kelvin's investigations about the\r\nsame time), and was named afterwards by him the increase of the _entropy_\r\nof the system in passing from the state C to the state D. This increase,\r\nbeing thus the same for the unlimited number of possible reversible paths\r\ninvolving independent variation of all its finite co-ordinates, along\r\nwhich the system can pass, can depend only on the terminal states. The\r\nentropy belonging to a given state is therefore a function of that state\r\nalone, irrespective of the manner in which it has been reached; and this\r\nis the justification of the assignment to it of a special name, connoting\r\na property of the system depending on its actual condition and not on its\r\nprevious history. Every reversible change in an isolated system thus\r\nmaintains the entropy of that system unaltered; no possible spontaneous\r\nchange can involve decrease of the entropy; while any defect of\r\nreversibility, arising from diffusion of matter or motion in the system,\r\nnecessarily leads to increase of entropy. For a physical or chemical\r\nsystem only those changes are spontaneously possible which would lead to\r\nincrease of the entropy; if the entropy is already a maximum for the\r\ngiven total energy, and so incapable of further continuous increase under\r\nthe conditions imposed upon the system, there must be stable equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThis definite quantity belonging to a material system, its entropy\r\n[phi], is thus concomitant with its energy E, which is also a definite\r\nfunction of its actual state by the law of conservation of energy;\r\nthese, along with its temperature T, and the various co-ordinates\r\nexpressing its geometrical configuration and its physical and chemical\r\nconstitution, are the quantities with which the thermodynamics of the\r\nsystem deals. That branch of science develops the consequences involved\r\nin just two principles: (i.) that the energy of every isolated system is\r\nconstant, and (ii.) that its entropy can never diminish; any\r\ncomplication that may be involved arises from complexity in the systems\r\nto which these two laws have to be applied.\r\n\r\n_The General Thermodynamic Equation._--When any physical or chemical\r\nsystem undergoes an infinitesimal change of state, we have [delta]E =\r\n[delta]H + [delta]U, where [delta]H is the energy that has been acquired\r\n_as heat_ from sources extraneous to the system during the change, and\r\n[delta]U is the energy that has been imparted by reversible agencies\r\nsuch as mechanical or electric work. It is, however, not usually\r\npossible to discriminate permanently between heat acquired and work\r\nimparted, for (unless for isothermal transformations) neither [delta]H\r\nnor [delta]U is the exact differential of a function of the constitution\r\nof the system and so independent of its previous history, although their\r\nsum [delta]E is such; but we can utilize the fact that [delta]H is equal\r\nto T[delta][phi] where [delta][phi] is such, as has just been seen. Thus\r\nE and [phi] represent properties of the system which, along with\r\ntemperature, pressure and other independent data specifying its\r\nconstitution, must form the variables of an analytical exposition. We\r\nhave, therefore, to substitute T[delta][phi] for [delta]H; also the\r\n_change_ of internal energy is determined by the change of constitution,\r\ninvolving a differential relation of type\r\n\r\n  [delta]U = -p[delta]v + [delta]W + [mu]1[delta]m1 + [mu]2[delta]m2\r\n    + ... + [mu]_n[delta]m_n,\r\n\r\nwhen the system consists of an intimate mixture (solution) of masses m1,\r\nm2, ... m_n of given constituents, which differ physically or chemically\r\nbut may be partially transformable into each other by chemical or\r\nphysical action during the changes under consideration, the whole being\r\nof volume v and under extraneous pressure p, while W is potential energy\r\narising from physical forces such as those of gravity, capillarity, &c.\r\nThe variables m1, m2, ... m_n may not be all independent; for example,\r\nif the system were chloride of ammonium gas existing along with its\r\ngaseous products of dissociation, hydrochloric acid and ammonia, only\r\none of the three masses would be independently variable. The sufficient\r\nnumber of these variables (independent components) together with two\r\nother variables, which may be v and T, or v and [phi], specifies and\r\ndetermines the state of the system, considered as matter in bulk, at\r\neach instant. It is usual to include [delta]W in [mu]1[delta]m1 + ...;\r\nin all cases where this is possible the single equation\r\n\r\n  [delta]E = T[delta][phi] - p[delta]v + [mu]1[delta]m1 + [mu]2[delta]m2\r\n    + ... + [mu]_n[delta]m_n (1)\r\n\r\nthus expresses the complete variation of the energy-function E arising\r\nfrom change of state; and when the part involving the n constitutive\r\ndifferentials has been expressed in terms of the number of them that are\r\nreally independent, this equation by itself becomes the unique\r\nexpression of _all_ the thermodynamic relations of the system. These are\r\nin fact the various relations ensuring that the right-hand side is an\r\nexact differential, and are of the type of reciprocal relations such as\r\nd[mu]_r/d[phi] = dT/dm_r.\r\n\r\nThe condition that the state of the system be one of stable equilibrium\r\nis that [delta][phi], the variation of entropy, be negative for all\r\nformally imaginable infinitesimal transformations which make [delta]E\r\nvanish; for as [delta][phi] cannot actually be negative for any\r\nspontaneous variation, none of these transformations can then occur.\r\nFrom the form of the equation, this condition is the same as that\r\n[delta]E - T[delta][phi] must be _positive for all possible_ variations\r\nof state of the system as above defined in terms of co-ordinates\r\nrepresenting its constitution in bulk, without restriction.\r\n\r\nWe can change one of the independent variables expressing the state of\r\nthe system from [phi] to T by subtracting [delta]([phi]T) from both\r\nsides of the equation of variation: then\r\n\r\n  [delta](E - T[phi]) = - [phi][delta]T - p[delta]v + [mu]1[delta]m1\r\n    + ... + [mu]_n[delta]m_n.\r\n\r\nIt follows that for _isothermal_ changes, i.e. those for which [delta]T\r\nis maintained null by an environment at constant temperature, the\r\ncondition of stable equilibrium is that the function E - T[phi] shall be\r\na minimum. If the system is subject to an external pressure p, which as\r\nwell as the temperature is imposed constant from without and thus\r\nincapable of variation through internal changes, the condition of stable\r\nequilibrium is similarly that E - T[phi] + pv shall be a minimum.\r\n\r\nA chemical system maintained at constant temperature by communication of\r\nheat from its environment may thus have several states of stable\r\nequilibrium corresponding to different minima of the function here\r\nconsidered, just as there may be several minima of elevation on a\r\nlandscape, one at the bottom of each depression; in fact, this analogy,\r\nwhen extended to space of n dimensions, exactly fits the case. If the\r\nsystem is sufficiently disturbed, for example, by electric shock, it may\r\npass over (explosively) from a higher to a lower minimum, but never\r\n(without compensation from outside) in the opposite direction. The\r\nformer passage, moreover, is often effected by introducing a new\r\nsubstance into the system; sometimes that substance is recovered\r\nunaltered at the end of the process, and then its action is said to be\r\npurely _catalytic_; its presence modifies the form of the function E -\r\nT[phi] so as to obliterate the ridge between the two equilibrium states\r\nin the graphical representation.\r\n\r\nThere are systems in which the equilibrium states are but very slightly\r\ndependent on temperature and pressure within wide limits, outside which\r\nreaction takes place. Thus while there are cases in which a state of\r\nmobile dissociation exists in the system which changes continuously as a\r\nfunction of these variables, there are others in which change does not\r\nsensibly occur at all until a certain _temperature of reaction_ is\r\nattained, after which it proceeds very rapidly owing to the heat\r\ndeveloped, and the system soon becomes sensibly permanent in a\r\ntransformed phase by completion of the reaction. In some cases of this\r\nlatter type the cause of the delay in starting lies possibly in passive\r\nresistance to change, of the nature of viscosity or friction, which is\r\ncompetent to convert an unstable mechanical equilibrium into a\r\nmoderately stable one; but in most such reactions there seems to be no\r\nexact equilibrium at any temperature, short of the ultimate state of\r\ndissipated energy in which the reaction is completed, although the\r\nvelocity of reaction is found to diminish exponentially with change of\r\ntemperature, and thus becomes insignificant at a small interval from the\r\ntemperature of pronounced activity.\r\n\r\n_Free Energy._--The quantity E - T[phi] thus plays the same fundamental\r\npart in the thermal statics of general chemical systems at uniform\r\ntemperature that the potential energy plays in the statics of mechanical\r\nsystems of unchanging constitution. It is a function of the geometrical\r\nco-ordinates, the physical and chemical constitution, and the\r\ntemperature of the system, which determines the conditions of stable\r\nequilibrium _at each temperature_; it is, in fact, the potential energy\r\ngeneralized so as to include temperature, and thus be a single function\r\nrelating to each temperature but at the same time affording a basis of\r\nconnexion between the properties of the system at different\r\ntemperatures. It has been called the _free energy_ of the system by\r\nHelmholtz, for it is the part of the energy whose variation is connected\r\nwith changes in the bodily structure of the system represented by the\r\nvariables m1, m2, ... m_n, and not with the irregular molecular motions\r\nrepresented by heat, so that it can take part freely in physical\r\ntransformations. Yet this holds good only subject to the condition that\r\nthe temperature is not varied; it has been seen above that for the more\r\ngeneral variation neither [delta]H nor [delta]U is an exact\r\ndifferential, and no line of separation can be drawn between thermal and\r\nmechanical energies.\r\n\r\nThe study of the evolution of ideas in this, the most abstract branch of\r\nmodern mathematical physics, is rendered difficult in the manner of most\r\npurely philosophical subjects by the variety of terminology, much of it\r\nonly partially appropriate, that has been employed to express the\r\nfundamental principles by different investigators and at different\r\nstages of the development. Attentive examination will show, what is\r\nindeed hardly surprising, that the principles of the theory of free\r\nenergy of Gibbs and Helmholtz had been already grasped and exemplified\r\nby Lord Kelvin in the very early days of the subject (see the paper \"On\r\nthe Thermoelastic and Thermomagnetic Properties of Matter, Part I.\"\r\n_Quarterly Journal of Mathematics_, No. 1, April 1855; reprinted in\r\nPhil. Mag., January 1878, and in _Math. and Phys. Papers_, vol. i. pp.\r\n291, seq.). Thus the striking new advance contained in the more modern\r\nwork of J. Willard Gibbs (1875-1877) and of Helmholtz (1882) was rather\r\nthe sustained general application of these ideas to chemical systems,\r\nsuch as the galvanic cell and dissociating gaseous systems, and in\r\ngeneral fashion to heterogeneous concomitant phases. The fundamental\r\npaper of Kelvin connecting the electromotive force of the cell with the\r\nenergy of chemical transformation is of date 1851, some years before the\r\ndistinction between free energy and total energy had definitely\r\ncrystallized out; and, possibly satisfied with the approximate exactness\r\nof his imperfect formula when applied to a Daniell's cell (_infra_), and\r\ndeterred by absence of experimental data, he did not return to the\r\nsubject. In 1852 he briefly announced (_Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin._) the\r\nprinciple of the dissipation of mechanical (or available) energy,\r\nincluding the necessity of compensation elsewhere when restoration\r\noccurs, in the form that \"any restoration of mechanical energy, without\r\nmore than an equivalent of dissipation, is impossible\"--probably even in\r\nvital activity; but a sufficient specification of available energy (cf.\r\n_infra_) was not then developed. In the paper above referred to, where\r\nthis was done, and illustrated by full application to solid elastic\r\nsystems, the total energy is represented by c and is named \"the\r\nintrinsic energy,\" the energy taken in during an isothermal\r\ntransformation is represented by e, of which H is taken in as heat,\r\nwhile the remainder, the change of free (or mechanical or available)\r\nenergy of the system is the unnamed quantity denoted by the symbol w,\r\nwhich is \"the work done by the applied forces\" at uniform temperature.\r\nIt is pointed out that it is w and not e that is the potential\r\nenergy-function for isothermal change, of which the form can be\r\ndetermined directly by dynamical and physical experiment, and from which\r\nalone the criteria of equilibrium and stress are to be derived--simply\r\nfor the reason that for all _reversible_ paths at constant temperature\r\nbetween the same terminal configurations, there must, by Carnot's\r\nprinciple, be the same gain or loss of heat. And a system of formulae\r\nare given (5) to (11)--_Ex. gr._ e = w - t(dw/dt) + J [int]s dt for\r\nfinding the total energy e for any temperature t when w and the thermal\r\ncapacity s of the system, in a standard state, have thus been\r\nascertained, and another for establishing connexion between the form of\r\nw for one temperature and its form for adjacent temperatures--which are\r\nidentical with those developed by Helmholtz long afterwards, in 1882,\r\nexcept that the entropy appears only as an unnamed integral. The\r\nprogress of physical science is formally identified with the exploration\r\nof this function w for physical systems, with continually increasing\r\nexactness and range--except where pure kinetic considerations prevail,\r\nin which cases the wider Hamiltonian dynamical formulation is\r\nfundamental. Another aspect of the matter will be developed below.\r\n\r\nA somewhat different procedure, in terms of entropy as fundamental, has\r\nbeen adopted and developed by Planck. In an isolated system the trend of\r\nchange must be in the direction which increases the entropy [phi], by\r\nClausius' form of the principle. But in experiment it is a system at\r\nconstant temperature rather than an adiabatic one that usually is\r\ninvolved; this can be attained formally by including in the isolated\r\nsystem (cf. _infra_) a source of heat at that temperature and of\r\nunlimited capacity, when the energy of the original system increases by\r\n[delta]E this source must give up heat of amount [delta]E, and its\r\nentropy therefore diminishes [delta]E/T. Thus for the original system\r\nmaintained at constant temperature T it is [delta][phi] - [delta]E/T\r\nthat must always be positive in spontaneous change, which is the same\r\ncriterion as was reached above. Reference may also be made to H.A.\r\nLorentz's _Collected Scientific Papers_, part i.\r\n\r\nA striking anticipation, almost contemporaneous, of Gibbs's\r\nthermodynamic potential theory (_infra_) was made by Clerk Maxwell in\r\nconnexion with the discussion of Andrews's experiments on the critical\r\ntemperature of mixed gases, in a letter published in Sir G.G. Stokes's\r\n_Scientific Correspondence_ (vol. ii. p. 34).\r\n\r\n_Available Energy._--The same quantity [phi], which Clausius named the\r\nentropy, arose in various ways in the early development of the subject,\r\nin the train of ideas of Rankine and Kelvin relating to the expression\r\nof the _available energy_ A of the material system. Suppose there were\r\naccessible an auxiliary system containing an _unlimited_ quantity of\r\nheat at absolute temperature T0, forming a condenser into which heat can\r\nbe discharged from the working system, or from which it may be recovered\r\nat that temperature: we proceed to find how much of the heat of our\r\nsystem is available for transformation into mechanical work, in a\r\nprocess which reduces the whole system to the temperature of this\r\ncondenser. Provided the process of reduction is performed reversibly, it\r\nis immaterial, by Carnot's principle, in what manner it is effected:\r\nthus in following it out in detail we can consider each elementary\r\nquantity of heat [delta]H removed from the system as set aside at its\r\nactual temperature between T and T + [delta]T for the production of\r\nmechanical work [delta]W and the residue of it [delta]H0 as directly\r\ndischarged into the condenser at T0. The principle of Carnot gives\r\n[delta]H/T = [delta]H0/T0, so that the portion of the heat [delta]H that\r\nis not available for work is [delta]H0, equal to T0[delta]H/T. In the\r\nwhole process the part not available in connexion with the condenser at\r\nT0 is therefore T0[int][delta]H/T. This quantity must be the same\r\nwhatever reversible process is employed: thus, for example, we may first\r\ntransform the system reversibly from the state C to the state D, and\r\nthen from the state D to the final state of uniform temperature T0. It\r\nfollows that the value of T0[int]dH/T, representing the heat degraded,\r\nis the same along all reversible paths of transformation from the state\r\nC to the state D; so that the function [int]dH/T is the excess of a\r\ndefinite quantity [phi] connected with the system in the former state as\r\ncompared with the latter.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to change the law of sign of [delta]H so that gain of heat\r\nby the system is reckoned positive; then, relative to a condenser of\r\nunlimited capacity at T0, the state C contains more mechanically\r\n_available energy_ than the state D by the amount E_C - E_D + T0\r\n[int]dH/T, that is, by E_C - E_D - T0([phi]_C - [phi]_D). In this way\r\nthe existence of an entropy function with a definite value for each\r\nstate of the system is again seen to be the direct analytical equivalent\r\nof Carnot's axiom that no process can be more efficient than a\r\nreversible process between the same initial and final states. The name\r\n_motivity_ of a system was proposed by Lord Kelvin in 1879 for this\r\nconception of available energy. It is here specified as relative to a\r\ncondenser of unlimited capacity at an assigned temperature T0: some such\r\nspecification is necessary to the definition; in fact, if T0 were the\r\nabsolute zero, all the energy would be mechanically available.\r\n\r\nBut we can obtain an intrinsically different and self-contained\r\ncomparison of the available energies in a system in two different states\r\nat different temperatures, by ascertaining how much energy would be\r\ndissipated in each in a reduction to the _same_ standard state of the\r\nsystem itself, at a standard temperature T0. We have only to reverse the\r\noperation, and change back this standard state to each of the others in\r\nturn. This will involve abstractions of heat [delta]H0 from the various\r\nportions of the system in the standard state, and returns of [delta]H to\r\nthe state at T0; if this return were [delta]H0T/T0 instead of [delta]H,\r\nthere would be no loss of availability in the direct process; hence\r\nthere is actual dissipation [delta]H - [delta]H0T/T0, that is\r\nT([delta][phi] - [delta][phi]0). On passing from state 1 to state 2\r\nthrough this standard state 0 the difference of these dissipations will\r\nrepresent the energy of the system that has become unavailable. Thus in\r\nthis sense E - T[phi] + T[phi]0 + const. represents for each state the\r\namount of energy that is available; but instead of implying an unlimited\r\nsource of heat at the standard temperature T0, it implies that there is\r\nno extraneous source. The available energy thus defined differs from E -\r\nT[phi], the _free energy_ of Helmholtz, or the _work function of the\r\napplied forces_ of Kelvin, which involves no reference to any standard\r\nstate, by a simple linear function of the temperature alone which is\r\nimmaterial as regards its applications.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the available mechanical energy arising from\r\ndifferences of temperature between the parts of the same system is a\r\nmore complex problem, because it involves a determination of the common\r\ntemperature to which reversible processes will ultimately reduce them;\r\nfor the simple case in which no changes of state occur the solution was\r\ngiven by Lord Kelvin in 1853, in connexion with the above train of ideas\r\n(cf. Tait's _Thermodynamics_, S179). In the present exposition the\r\nsystem is sensibly in equilibrium at each stage, so that its temperature\r\nT is always uniform throughout; isolated portions at different\r\ntemperatures would be treated as different systems.\r\n\r\n_Thermodynamic Potentials._--We have now to develop the relations\r\ninvolved in the general equation (1) of thermodynamics. Suppose the\r\nmaterial system includes two coexistent states or phases, with\r\nopportunity for free interchange of constituents--for example, a salt\r\nsolution and the aqueous vapour in equilibrium with it. Then in\r\nequilibrium a slight transfer [delta]m of the water-substance of mass\r\nm_r constituting the vapour, into the water-substance of mass m_s,\r\nexisting in the solution, should not produce any alteration of the first\r\norder in [delta]E - T[delta][phi]; therefore [mu]_r must be equal to\r\n[mu]_s. The quantity [mu]_r is called by Willard Gibbs the potential of\r\nthe corresponding substance of mass m_r; it may be defined as its\r\nmarginal available energy per unit mass at the given temperature. If\r\nthen a system involves in this way coexistent phases which remain\r\npermanently separate, the potentials of any constituent must be the same\r\nin all of them in which that constituent exists, for otherwise it would\r\ntend to pass from the phases in which its potential is higher to those\r\nin which it is lower. If the constituent is non-existent in any phase,\r\nits potential when in that phase would have to be higher than in the\r\nothers in which it is actually present; but as the potential increases\r\nlogarithmically when the density of the constituent is indefinitely\r\ndiminished, this condition is automatically satisfied--or, more\r\nstrictly, the constitutent cannot be entirely absent, but the presence\r\nof the merest trace will suffice to satisfy the condition of equality of\r\npotential. When the action of the force of gravity is taken into\r\naccount, the potential of each constituent must include the\r\ngravitational potential _gh_; in the equilibrium state the total\r\npotential of each constituent, including this part, must be the same\r\nthroughout all parts of the system into which it is freely mobile. An\r\nexample is Dalton's law of the independent distributions of the gases in\r\nthe atmosphere, if it were in a state of rest. A similar statement\r\napplies to other forms of mechanical potential energy arising from\r\nactions at a distance.\r\n\r\nWhen a slight constitutive change occurs in a galvanic element at given\r\ntemperature, producing available energy of electric current, in a\r\nreversible manner and isothermally, at the expense of chemical energy,\r\nit is the free energy of the system E - T[phi], not its total intrinsic\r\nenergy, whose value must be conserved during the process. Thus the\r\nelectromotive force is equal to the change of this free energy per\r\nelectrochemical equivalent of reaction in the cell. This proposition,\r\ndeveloped by Gibbs and later by Helmholtz, modifies the earlier one of\r\nKelvin--which tacitly assumed all the energy of reaction to be\r\navailable--except in the cases such as that of a Daniell's cell, in\r\nwhich the magnitude of the electromotive force does not depend sensibly\r\non the temperature.\r\n\r\nThe effects produced on electromotive forces by difference of\r\nconcentrations in dilute solutions can thus be accounted for and traced\r\nout, from the knowledge of the form of the free energy for such cases;\r\nas also the effects of pressure in the case of gas batteries. The free\r\nenergy does not sensibly depend on whether the substance is solid or\r\nfused--for the two states are in equilibrium at the temperature of\r\nfusion--though the total energy differs in these two cases by the heat\r\nof fusion; for this reason, as Gibbs pointed out, voltaic\r\npotential-differences are the same for the fused as for the solid state\r\nof the substances concerned.\r\n\r\n_Relations involving Constitution only._--The potential of a component\r\nin a given solution can depend only on the temperature and pressure of\r\nthe solution, and the densities of the various components, including\r\nitself; as no distance-actions are usually involved in chemical physics,\r\nit will not depend on the aggregate masses present. The example above\r\nmentioned, of two coexistent phases liquid and vapour, indicates that\r\nthere may thus be relations between the constitutions of the phases\r\npresent in a chemical system which do not involve their total masses.\r\nThese are developed in a very direct manner in Willard Gibbs's original\r\nprocedure. In so far as attractions at a distance (a uniform force such\r\nas gravity being excepted) and capillary actions at the interfaces\r\nbetween the phases are inoperative, the fundamental equation (1) can be\r\nintegrated. Increasing the volume k times, and all the masses to the\r\nsame extent--in fact, placing alongside each other k identical systems\r\nat the same temperature and pressure--will increase [phi] and E in the\r\nsame ratio k; thus E must be a homogeneous function of the first degree\r\nof the independent variables [phi], v, m1, ..., m_n, and therefore by\r\nEuler's theorem relating to such functions\r\n\r\n  E = T[phi] - pv + [mu]1m1 + ... + [mu]_nm_n.\r\n\r\nThis integral equation merely expresses the additive character of the\r\nenergies and entropies of adjacent portions of the system at uniform\r\ntemperature, and thus depends only on the absence of sensible physical\r\naction directly across finite distances. If we form from it the\r\nexpression for the complete differential [delta]E, and subtract (1),\r\nthere remains the relation\r\n\r\n  0 = [phi][delta]T - v[delta]p + m1[delta][mu]1\r\n    + ... + m_n[delta][mu]_n. (2)\r\n\r\nThis implies that in each phase the change of pressure depends on and is\r\ndetermined by the changes in T, [mu]1, ... [mu]_n alone; as we know\r\nbeforehand that a physical property like pressure is an analytical\r\nfunction of the state of the system, it is therefore a function of these\r\nn + 1 quantities. When they are all independently variable, the\r\ndensities of the various constituents and of the entropy in the phase\r\nare expressed by the partial fluxions of p with respect to them: thus\r\n\r\n  [phi]   dp  m_r     dp\r\n  ----- = --, --- = -------.\r\n    v     dT   v    d[mu]_r\r\n\r\nBut when, as in the case above referred to of chloride of ammonium gas\r\nexisting partially dissociated along with its constituents, the masses\r\nare not independent, necessary linear relations, furnished by the laws\r\nof definite combining proportions, subsist between the partial fluxions,\r\nand the form of the function which expresses p is thus restricted, in a\r\nmanner which is easily expressible in each special case.\r\n\r\nThis proposition that the pressure in any phase is a function of the\r\ntemperature and of the potentials of the independent constituents, thus\r\nappears as a consequence of Carnot's axiom combined with the energy\r\nprinciple and the absence of effective actions at a distance. It shows\r\nthat at a given temperature and pressure the potentials are not all\r\nindependent, that there is a necessary relation connecting them. This is\r\nthe _equation of state_ or constitution of the phase, whose existence\r\nforms one mode of expression of Carnot's principle, and in which all the\r\nproperties of the phase are involved and can thence be derived by simple\r\ndifferentiation.\r\n\r\n_The Phase Rule._--When the material system contains only a single\r\nphase, the number of independent variations, in addition to change of\r\ntemperature and pressure, that can spontaneously occur in its\r\nconstitution is thus one less than the number of its independent\r\nconstituents. But where several phases coexist in contact in the same\r\nsystem, the number of possible independent variations may be much\r\nsmaller. The present independent variables [mu]1, ..., [mu]_n are\r\nspecially appropriate in this problem, because each of them has the same\r\nvalue in all the phases. Now each phase has its own characteristic\r\nequation, giving a relation between [delta]p, [delta]T, and\r\n[delta][mu]1, ... [delta][mu]_n, or such of the latter as are\r\nindependent; if r phases coexist, there are r such relations; hence the\r\nnumber of possible independent variations, including those of v and T,\r\nis reduced to m - r + 2, where m is the number of independently variable\r\nchemical constituents which the system contains. This number of degrees\r\nof constitutive freedom cannot be negative; therefore the number of\r\npossible phases that can coexist alongside each other cannot exceed m +\r\n2. If m + 2 phases actually coexist, there is no variable quantity in\r\nthe system, thus the temperature and pressure and constitutions of the\r\nphases are all determined; such is the triple point at which ice, water\r\nand vapour exist in presence of each other. If there are m + 1\r\ncoexistent phases, the system can vary in one respect only; for example,\r\nat any temperature of water-substance different from the triple point\r\ntwo phases only, say liquid and vapour, or liquid and solid, coexist,\r\nand the pressure is definite, as also are the densities and potentials\r\nof the components. Finally, when but one phase, say water, is present,\r\nboth pressure and temperature can vary independently. The first example\r\nillustrates the case of systems, physical or chemical, in which there is\r\nonly one possible state of equilibrium, forming a point of transition\r\nbetween different constitutions; in the second type each temperature has\r\nits own completely determined state of equilibrium; in other cases the\r\nconstitution in the equilibrium state is indeterminate as regards the\r\ncorresponding number of degrees of freedom. By aid of this phase rule of\r\nGibbs the number of different chemical substances actually interacting\r\nin a given complex system can be determined from observation of the\r\ndegree of spontaneous variation which it exhibits; the rule thus lies at\r\nthe foundation of the modern subject of chemical equilibrium and\r\ncontinuous chemical change in mixtures or alloys, and in this connexion\r\nit has been widely applied and developed in the experimental\r\ninvestigations of Roozeboom and van 't Hoff and other physical chemists,\r\nmainly of the Dutch school.\r\n\r\n_Extent to which the Theory can be practically developed._--It is only\r\nin systems in which the number of independent variables is small that\r\nthe forms of the various potentials,--or the form of the fundamental\r\ncharacteristic equation expressing the energy of the system in terms of\r\nits entropy and constitution, or the pressure in terms of the\r\ntemperature and the potentials, which includes them all,--can be readily\r\napproximated to by experimental determinations. Even in the case of the\r\nsimple system water-vapour, which is fundamental for the theory of the\r\nsteam-engine, this has not yet been completely accomplished. The general\r\ntheory is thus largely confined, as above, to defining the restrictions\r\non the degree of variability of a complex chemical system which the\r\nprinciple of Carnot imposes. The tracing out of these general relations\r\nof continuity of state is much facilitated by geometrical diagrams, such\r\nas James Thomson first introduced in order to exhibit and explain\r\nAndrews' results as to the range of coexistent phases in carbonic acid.\r\nGibbs's earliest thermodynamic surface had for its co-ordinates volume,\r\nentropy and energy; it was constructed to scale by Maxwell for\r\nwater-substance, and is fully explained in later editions of the _Theory\r\nof Heat_ (1875); it forms a relief map which, by simple inspection,\r\nreveals the course of the transformations of water, with the\r\ncorresponding mechanical and thermal changes, in its three coexistent\r\nstates of solid, liquid and gas. In the general case, when the substance\r\nhas more than one independently variable constituent, there are more\r\nthan three variables to be represented; but Gibbs has shown the utility\r\nof surfaces representing, for instance, the entropy in terms of the\r\nconstitutive variables when temperature and pressure are maintained\r\nconstant. Such graphical methods are now of fundamental importance in\r\nconnexion with the phase rule, for the experimental exploration of the\r\ntrend of the changes of constitution of complex mixtures with\r\ninteracting components, which arise as the physical conditions are\r\naltered, as, for example in modern metallurgy, in the theory of alloys.\r\nThe study of the phenomena of condensation in a mixture of two gases or\r\nvapours, initiated by Andrews and developed in this manner by van der\r\nWaals and his pupils, forms a case in point (see CONDENSATION OF GASES).\r\n\r\n_Dilute Components: Perfect Gases and Dilute Solutions._--There are,\r\nhowever, two simple limiting cases, in which the theory can be completed\r\nby a determination of the functions involved in it, which throw much\r\nlight on the phenomena of actual systems not far removed from these\r\nideal limits. They are the cases of mixtures of perfect gases, and of\r\nvery dilute solutions.\r\n\r\n  If, following Gibbs, we apply his equation (2) expressing the pressure\r\n  in terms of the temperature and the potentials, to a very dilute\r\n  solution of substances m2, m3, ... m_n in a solvent substance m1, and\r\n  vary the co-ordinate m_r alone, p and T remaining unvaried, we have in\r\n  the equilibrium state\r\n\r\n       d[mu]_r     d[mu]1            d[mu]_n\r\n    m_r------- + m1------ + ... + m_n------- = 0,\r\n        dm_r        dm_r              dm_r\r\n\r\n  in which every m except m1 is very small, while d[mu]1/dm_r is\r\n  presumably finite. As the second term is thus finite, this requires\r\n  that the total potential of each component m_r, which is m_r\r\n  d[mu]_r/dm_r, shall be finite, say k_r, in the limit when m_r is null.\r\n  Thus for very small concentrations the potential [mu]_r of a dilute\r\n  component must be of the form k_r log m_r/v, being proportional to the\r\n  logarithm of the density of that component; it thus tends\r\n  logarithmically to an infinite value at evanescent concentrations,\r\n  showing that removal of the last traces of any impurity would demand\r\n  infinite proportionate expenditure of available energy, and is\r\n  therefore practically impossible with finite intensities of force. It\r\n  should be noted, however, that this argument applies only to fluid\r\n  phases, for in the case of deposition of a solid m_r is not uniformly\r\n  distributed throughout the phase; thus it remains possible for the\r\n  growth of a crystal at its surface in aqueous solution to extrude all\r\n  the water except such as is in some form of chemical combination.\r\n\r\n  The precise value of this logarithmic expression for the potential can\r\n  be readily determined for the case of a perfect gas from its\r\n  characteristic properties, and can be thence extended to other dilute\r\n  forms of matter. We have pv = R/m.T for unit mass of the gas, where m\r\n  is the molecular weight, being 2 for hydrogen, and R is a constant\r\n  equal to 82 X 10^6 in C.G.S. dynamical units, or 2 calories\r\n  approximately in thermal energy units, which is the same for all gases\r\n  because they have all the same number of molecules per unit volume.\r\n  The increment of heat received by the unit mass of the gas is [delta]H\r\n  = p[delta]v + [kappa][delta]T, [kappa] being thus the specific heat at\r\n  constant volume, which can be a function only of the temperature. Thus\r\n\r\n    [phi] = [int]dH/T = R/m.log v + [int][kappa]T^(-1)dT;\r\n\r\n  and the available energy A per unit mass is E - T[phi] + T[phi]0 where\r\n  E = [epsilon] + [int][kappa]dT, the integral being for a standard\r\n  state, and [epsilon] being intrinsic energy of chemical constitution;\r\n  so that\r\n\r\n    A = [epsilon] + [phi]0T + [int][kappa]dT - T [int][kappa]T^(-1)dT -\r\n      R/m.T log v.\r\n\r\n  If there are [nu] molecules in the unit mass, and N per unit volume,\r\n  we have m[nu] = Nmv, each being 2 [nu]', where [nu]' is the number of\r\n  molecules per unit mass in hydrogen; thus the free energy per molecule\r\n  is a' + R'T log bN, where b = m/2[nu]', R' = R/2[nu]', and a' is a\r\n  function of T alone. It is customary to avoid introducing the unknown\r\n  molecular constant [nu]' by working with the available energy per\r\n  \"gramme-molecule,\" that is, for a number of grammes expressed by the\r\n  molecular weight of the substance; this is a constant multiple of the\r\n  available energy per molecule, and is a + RT log[rho], [rho] being the\r\n  density equal to bN where b = m/2[nu]'. This formula may now be\r\n  extended by simple summation to a mixture of gases, on the ground of\r\n  Dalton's experimental principle that each of the components behaves in\r\n  presence of the others as it would do in a vacuum. The components are,\r\n  in fact, actually separable wholly or partially in reversible ways\r\n  which may be combined into cycles, for example, either (i.) by\r\n  diffusion through a porous partition, taking account of the work of\r\n  the pressures, or (ii.) by utilizing the modified constitution towards\r\n  the top of a long column of the mixture arising from the action of\r\n  gravity, or (iii.) by reversible absorption of a single component.\r\n\r\n  If we employ in place of available energy the form of characteristic\r\n  equation which gives the pressure in terms of the temperature and\r\n  potentials, the pressure of the mixture is expressed as the sum of\r\n  those belonging to its components: this equation was made by Gibbs the\r\n  basis of his analytical theory of gas mixtures, which he tested by its\r\n  application to the only data then available, those of the equilibrium\r\n  of dissociation of nitrogen peroxide (2NO2 <--> N2O4) vapour.\r\n\r\n_Van 't Hoff's Osmotic Principle: Theoretical Explanation._--We proceed\r\nto examine how far the same formulae as hold for gases apply to the\r\navailable energy of matter in solution which is so dilute that each\r\nmolecule of the dissolved substance, though possibly the centre of a\r\ncomplex of molecules of the solvent, is for nearly all the time beyond\r\nthe sphere of direct influence of the other molecules of the dissolved\r\nsubstance. The available energy is a function only of the co-ordinates\r\nof the matter in bulk and the temperature; its change on further\r\ndilution, with which alone we are concerned in the transformations of\r\ndilute solutions, can depend only on the further separation of these\r\nmolecular complexes in space that is thereby produced, as no one of them\r\nis in itself altered. The change is therefore a function only of the\r\nnumber N of the dissolved molecules per unit volume, and of the\r\ntemperature, and is, per molecule, expressible in a form entirely\r\nindependent of their constitution and of that of the medium in which\r\nthey are dissolved. This suggests that the expression for the change on\r\ndilution is the same as the known one for a gas, in which the same\r\nmolecules would exist free and in the main outside each other's spheres\r\nof influence; which confirms and is verified by the experimental\r\nprinciple of van 't Hoff, that osmotic pressure obeys the laws of\r\ngaseous pressure with identically the same physical constants as those\r\nof gases. It can be held, in fact, that this suggestion does not fall\r\nshort of a demonstration, on the basis of Carnot's principle, and\r\nindependent of special molecular theory, that in all cases where the\r\nmolecules of a component, whether it be of a gas or of a solution, are\r\noutside each other's spheres of influence, the available energy, so far\r\nas regards dilution, must have a common form, and the physical constants\r\nmust therefore be the known gas-constants. The customary exposition\r\nderives this principle, by an argument involving cycles, from Henry's\r\nlaw of solution of gases; it is sensibly restricted to such solutes as\r\nappear concomitantly in the free gaseous state, but theoretically it\r\nbecomes general when it is remembered that no solute can be absolutely\r\nnon-volatile.\r\n\r\n_Source of the Idea of Temperature._--The single new element that\r\nthermodynamics introduces into the ordinary dynamical specification of a\r\nmaterial system is temperature. This conception is akin to that of\r\npotential, except that it is given to us directly by our sense of heat.\r\nBut if that were not so, we could still demonstrate, on the basis of\r\nCarnot's principle, that there is a definite function of the state of a\r\nbody which must be the same for all of a series of connected bodies,\r\nwhen thermal equilibrium has become established so that there is no\r\ntendency for heat to flow from one to another. For we can by mere\r\ngeometrical displacement change the order of the bodies so as to bring\r\ndifferent ones into direct contact. If this disturbed the thermal\r\nequilibrium, we could construct cyclic processes to take advantage of\r\nthe resulting flow of heat to do mechanical work, and such processes\r\nmight be carried on without limit. Thus it is proved that if a body A\r\nis in temperature-equilibrium with B, and B with C, then A must be in\r\nequilibrium with C directly. This argument can be applied, by aid of\r\nadiabatic partitions, even when the bodies are in a field of force so\r\nthat mechanical work is required to change their geometrical\r\narrangement; it was in fact employed by Maxwell to extend from the case\r\nof a gas to that of any other system the proposition that the\r\ntemperature is the same all along a vertical column in equilibrium under\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nIt had been shown from the kinetic theory by Maxwell that in a\r\ngas-column the mean kinetic energy of the molecules is the same at all\r\nheights. If the only test of equality of temperature consisted in\r\nbringing the bodies into contact, this would be rather a proof that\r\nthermal temperature is of the same physical nature in all parts of the\r\nfield of force; but temperature can also be equalized across a distance\r\nby radiation, so that this law for gases is itself already necessitated\r\nby Carnot's general principle, and merely confirmed or verified by the\r\nspecial gas-theory. But without introducing into the argument the\r\nexistence of radiation, the uniformity of temperature throughout all\r\nphases in equilibrium is necessitated by the doctrine of energetics\r\nalone, as otherwise, for example, the raising of a quantity of gas to\r\nthe top of the gravitational column in an adiabatic enclosure together\r\nwith the lowering of an equal mass to the bottom would be a source of\r\npower, capable of unlimited repetition.\r\n\r\n_Laws of Chemical Equilibrium based on Available Energy._--The complete\r\ntheory of chemical and physical equilibrium in gaseous mixtures and in\r\nvery dilute solutions may readily be developed in terms of available\r\nenergy (cf. _Phil. Trans_., 1897, A, pp. 266-280), which forms perhaps\r\nthe most vivid and most direct procedure. The available energy per\r\nmolecule of any kind, in a mixture of perfect gases in which there are N\r\nmolecules of that kind per unit volume, has been found to be a' + R'T\r\nlogbN where R' is the universal physical constant connected with R\r\nabove. This expression represents the marginal increase of available\r\nenergy due to the introduction of one more molecule of that kind into\r\nthe system as actually constituted. The same formula also applies, by\r\nwhat has already been stated, to substances in dilute solution in any\r\ngiven solvent. In any isolated system in a mobile state of reaction or\r\nof internal dissociation, the condition of chemical equilibrium is that\r\nthe available energy at constant temperature is a minimum, therefore\r\nthat it is stationary, and slight change arising from fresh reaction\r\nwould not sensibly alter it. Suppose that this reaction, per molecule\r\naffected by it, is equivalent to introducing n1 molecules of type N1, n2\r\nof type N2, &c., into the system, n1, n2, ... being the numbers of\r\nmolecules of the different types that take part in the reaction, as\r\nshown by its chemical equation, reckoned positive when they appear,\r\nnegative when they disappear. Then in the state of equilibrium\r\n\r\n  n1(a'1 + R'T log b1N1) + n2(a'2 + R'T log b2N2) + ...\r\n\r\nmust vanish. Therefore N1^(n1) N2^(n2) ... must be equal to K, a\r\nfunction of the temperature alone. This law, originally based by\r\nGuldberg and Waage on direct statistics of molecular interaction,\r\nexpresses for each temperature the relation connecting the densities of\r\nthe interacting substances, in dilution comparable as regards density\r\nwith the perfect gaseous state, when the reaction has come to the state\r\nof mobile equilibrium.\r\n\r\nAll properties of any system, including the heat of reaction, are\r\nexpressible in terms of its available energy A, equal to E - T[phi] +\r\n[phi]0T. Thus as the constitution of the system changes with the\r\ntemperature, we have\r\n\r\n  dA   dE    d[phi]\r\n  -- = -- - T------ - ([phi] - [phi]0)\r\n  dT   dT      dT\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n  [delta]E = [delta]H + [delta]W, [delta]H = T[delta][phi],\r\n\r\n[delta]H being heat and [delta]W mechanical and chemical energy imparted\r\nto the system at constant temperature; hence\r\n\r\n  d(A - W)                                       d(A - W)\r\n  -------- = -([phi] - [phi]0), so that A = E + T--------,\r\n     dT                                             dT\r\n\r\nwhich is equivalent to\r\n\r\n               d   /A - W\\\r\n  E - W = -T^2 -- (-------).\r\n               dT  \\  T  /\r\n\r\nThis general formula, applied differentially, expresses the heat\r\n[delta]E - [delta]W absorbed by a reaction in terms of [delta]A, the\r\nchange produced by it in the available energy of the system, and of\r\n[delta]W, the mechanical and electrical work done on the system during\r\nits progress.\r\n\r\nIn the problem of reaction in gaseous systems or in very dilute\r\nsolution, the change of available energy per molecule of reaction has\r\njust been found to be\r\n\r\n  [delta]A = [delta]A0 + R'T log K', where K' = b1^(n1) b2^(n2) ... K;\r\n\r\nthus, when the reaction is spontaneous without requiring external work,\r\nthe heat absorbed per molecule of reaction is\r\n\r\n       d  [delta]A0            d\r\n  -T^2 -- ---------, or -R'T^2 -- log K.\r\n       dT     T                dT\r\n\r\nThis formula has been utilized by van 't Hoff to determine, in terms of\r\nthe heat of reaction, the displacement of equilibrium in various systems\r\narising from change of temperature; for K, equal to N1^(n1) N2^(n2) ...,\r\nis the reaction-parameter through which alone the temperature affects\r\nthe law of chemical equilibrium in dilute systems.\r\n\r\n_Interfacial Phenomena: Liquid Films._--The characteristic equation\r\nhitherto developed refers to the state of an element of mass in the\r\ninterior of a homogeneous substance: it does not apply to matter in the\r\nneighbourhood of the transition between two adjacent phases. A\r\nremarkable analysis has been developed by J.W. Gibbs in which the\r\npresent methods concerning matter in bulk are extended to the phenomena\r\nat such an interface, without the introduction of any molecular theory;\r\nit forms the thermodynamic completion of Gauss's mechanical theory of\r\ncapillarity, based on the early form of the principle of total energy.\r\nThe validity of the fundamental doctrine of available energy, so far as\r\nregards all mechanical actions in bulk such as surface tensions, is\r\npostulated, even when applied to interfacial layers so thin as to be\r\nbeyond our means of measurement; the argument from perpetual motions\r\nbeing available here also, as soon as we have experimentally ascertained\r\nthat the said tensions are definite physical properties of the state of\r\nthe interface and not merely accidental phenomena. The procedure will\r\nthen consist in assuming a definite excess of energy, of entropy, and of\r\nthe masses of the various components, each per unit surface, at the\r\ninterface, the potential of each component being of necessity, in\r\nequilibrium, the same as it is in the adjacent masses. The interfacial\r\ntransition layer thus provides in a sense a new surface-phase coexistent\r\nwith those on each side of it, and having its own characteristic\r\nequation. It is only the extent of the interface and not its curvatures\r\nthat need enter into this relation, because any slight influence of the\r\nlatter can be eliminated from the equation by slightly displacing the\r\nposition of the surface which is taken to represent the interface\r\ngeometrically. By an argument similar to one given above, it is shown\r\nthat one of the forms of the characteristic equation is a relation\r\nexpressing the surface tension as a function of the temperature and the\r\npotentials of the various components present on the two sides of the\r\ninterface; and from the differentiation of this the surface densities of\r\nthe superficial distributions of these components (as above defined) can\r\nbe obtained. The conditions that a specified new phase may become\r\ndeveloped when two other given ones are brought into contact, i.e. that\r\na chemical reaction may start at the interface, are thence formally\r\nexpressed in terms of the surface tensions of the three transition\r\nlayers and the pressures in the three phases. In the case of a thin\r\nsoap-film, sudden extension of any part reduces the interfacial density\r\nof each component at each surface of the film, and so alters the surface\r\ntension, which requires time to recover by the very slow diffusion of\r\ndissolved material from other parts of the thin film; the system being\r\nstable, this change must be an increase of tension, and constitutes a\r\nspecies of elasticity in the film. Thus in a vertical film the surface\r\ntension must be greater in the higher parts, as they have to sustain the\r\nweight of the lower parts; the upper parts, in fact, stretch until the\r\nsuperficial densities of the components there situated are reduced to\r\nthe amounts that correspond to the tension required for this purpose.\r\nSuch a film could not therefore consist of pure water. But there is a\r\nlimit to these processes: if the film becomes so thin that there is no\r\nwater in bulk between its surfaces, the tensions cannot adjust\r\nthemselves in this slow way by migration of components from one part of\r\nthe film to another; if the film can survive at all after it has become\r\nof molecular thickness, it must be as a definite molecular structure all\r\nacross its thickness. Of such type are the black spots that break out in\r\nsoap-films (suggested by Gibbs and proved by the measures of Reinold and\r\nRucker): the spots increase in size because their tension is less than\r\nthat of the surrounding film, but their indefinite increase is\r\npresumably stopped in practice by some clogging or viscous agency at\r\ntheir boundary.\r\n\r\n_Transition to Molecular Theory._--The subject of energetics, based on\r\nthe doctrine of available energy, deals with matter in bulk and is not\r\nconcerned with its molecular constitution, which it is expressly\r\ndesigned to eliminate from the problem. This analysis of the phenomena\r\nof surface tension shows how far the principle of negation of perpetual\r\nmotions can carry us, into regions which at first sight might be classed\r\nas molecular. But, as in other cases, it is limited to pointing out the\r\ngeneral scheme of relations within which the phenomena can have their\r\nplay. There is now a considerable body of knowledge correlating surface\r\ntension with chemical constitution, especially to a certain extent with\r\nthe numerical density of the distribution of molecules; thus R. Eotvos\r\nhas shown that a law of proportionality exists for wide classes of\r\nsubstances between the temperature-gradient of the surface tension and\r\nthe density of the molecules over the surface layer, which varies as the\r\ntwo-thirds power of the number per unit volume (see CHEMISTRY:\r\n_Physical_). This takes us into the sphere of molecular science, where\r\nat present we have only such indications largely derived from\r\nexperiment, if we except the mere notion of inter-atomic forces of\r\nunknown character on which the older theories of capillarity, those of\r\nLaplace and Poisson, were constructed.\r\n\r\nIn other topics the same restrictions on the scope of the simple\r\nstatical theory of energy appear. From the ascertained behaviour in\r\ncertain respects of gaseous media we are able to construct their\r\ncharacteristic equation, and correlate their remaining relations by\r\nmeans of its consequences. Part of the experimental knowledge required\r\nfor this purpose is the values of the gas-constants, which prove to be\r\nthe same for all nearly perfect gases. The doctrine of energetics by\r\nitself can give no clue as to why this should be so; it can only\r\nconstruct a scheme for each simple or complex medium on the basis of its\r\nown experimentally determined characteristic equation. The explanation\r\nof uniformities in the intrinsic constitutions of various media belongs\r\nto molecular theory, which is a distinct and in the main more complex\r\nand more speculative department of knowledge. When we proceed further\r\nand find, with van 't Hoff, that these same universal gas-constants\r\nreappear in the relations of very dilute solutions, our demand for an\r\nexplanation such as can only be provided by molecular theory (as\r\n_supra_) is intensely stimulated. But except in respects such as these\r\nthe doctrine of energetics gives a complete synthesis of the course and\r\nrelations of the chemical reactions of matter in bulk, from which we can\r\neliminate atomism altogether by restating the merely numerical atomic\r\ntheory of Dalton as a principle of equivalent combining proportions. Of\r\nrecent years there has been a considerable school of chemists who insist\r\non this procedure as a purification of their science from the\r\nhypothetical ideas as to atoms and molecules, in terms of which its\r\nexperimental facts have come to be expressed. A complete system of\r\ndoctrine can be developed in this manner, but its scope will be limited.\r\nIt makes use of one principle of correlation, the doctrine of available\r\nenergy, and discards another such principle, the atomic theory. Nor can\r\nit be said that the one principle is really more certain and definite\r\nthan the other. This may be illustrated by what has sometimes by German\r\nwriters been called Gibbs's paradox: the energy that is available for\r\nmechanical effect in the inter-diffusion of given volumes of two gases\r\ndepends only on these volumes and their pressures, and is independent of\r\nwhat the gases are; if the gases differed only infinitesimally in\r\nconstitution it would still be the same, and the question arises where\r\nwe are to stop, for we cannot suppose the inter-diffusion of two\r\nidentical gases to be a source of power. This then looks like a real\r\nfailure, or rather limitation, of the principle; and there are other\r\nsuch, that can only be satisfactorily explained by aid of the\r\ncomplementary doctrine of molecular theory. That theory, in fact, shows\r\nthat the more nearly identical the gases are, the slower will be the\r\nprocess of inter-diffusion, so that the mechanical energy will indeed be\r\navailable, but only after a time that becomes indefinitely prolonged. It\r\nis a case in which the simple doctrine of energetics becomes inadequate\r\nbefore the limit is reached. The phenomena of highly rarefied gases\r\nprovide other cases. And in fact the only reason hitherto thought of for\r\nthe invariable tendency of available energy to diminish, is that it\r\nrepresents the general principle that in the kinetic play of a vast\r\nassemblage of independent molecules individually beyond our control, the\r\nnormal tendency is for the regularities to diminish and the motions to\r\nbecome less correlated: short of some such reason, it is an unexplained\r\nempirical principle. In the special departments of dynamical physics on\r\nthe other hand, the molecular theory, there dynamical and therefore much\r\nmore difficult and less definite, is an indispensable part of the\r\nframework of science; and even experimental chemistry now leans more and\r\nmore on new physical methods and instruments. Without molecular theory\r\nthe clue which has developed into spectrum analysis, bringing with it\r\nstellar chemistry and a new physical astronomy, would not have been\r\navailable; nor would the laws of diffusion and conduction in gases have\r\nattained more than an empirical form; nor would it have been possible to\r\nweave the phenomena of electrodynamics and radiation into an entirely\r\nrational theory.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of available energy, as the expression of thermodynamic\r\ntheory, is directly implied in Carnot's Essai of 1824, and constitutes,\r\nin fact, its main theme; it took a fresh start, in the light of fuller\r\nexperimental knowledge regarding the nature of heat, in the early\r\nmemoirs of Rankine and Lord Kelvin, which may be found in their\r\nCollected Scientific Papers; a subsequent exposition occurs in Maxwell's\r\n_Theory of Heat_; its most familiar form of statement is Lord Kelvin's\r\nprinciple of the dissipation of available energy. Its principles were\r\nvery early applied by James Thomson to a physico-chemical problem, that\r\nof the influence of stress on the growth of crystals in their mother\r\nliquor. The \"thermodynamic function\" introduced by Rankine into its\r\ndevelopment is the same as the \"entropy\" of the material system,\r\nindependently defined by Clausius about the same time. Clausius's form\r\nof the principle, that in an adiabatic system the entropy tends\r\ncontinually to increase, has been placed by Professor Willard Gibbs, of\r\nYale University, at the foundation of his magnificent but complex and\r\ndifficult development of the theory. His monumental memoir \"On the\r\nEquilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances,\" first published in _Trans.\r\nConnecticut Academy_ (1876-1878), made a clean sweep of the subject; and\r\nworkers in the modern experimental science of physical chemistry have\r\nreturned to it again and again to find their empirical principles\r\nforecasted in the light of pure theory, and to derive fresh inspiration\r\nfor new departures. As specially preparatory to Gibbs's general\r\ndiscussion may be mentioned Lord Rayleigh's memoir on the thermodynamics\r\nof gaseous diffusion (_Phil. Mag._, 1876), which was expounded by\r\nMaxwell in the 9th edition of the _Ency. Brit_. (art. DIFFUSION). The\r\nfundamental importance of the doctrine of dissipation of energy for the\r\ntheory of chemical reaction had already been insisted on in general\r\nterms by Rayleigh; subsequent to, but independently of, Gibbs's work it\r\nhad been elaborated by von Helmholtz (_Gesamm. Abhandl_. ii. and iii.)\r\nin connexion with the thermodynamics of voltaic cells, and more\r\nparticularly in the calculation of the free or available energy of\r\nsolutions from data of vapour-pressure, with a view to the application\r\nto the theory of concentration cells, therein also coming close to the\r\ndoctrine of osmotic pressure. This form of the general theory has here\r\nbeen traced back substantially to Lord Kelvin under date 1855.\r\nExpositions and developments on various lines will be found in papers by\r\nRiecke and by Planck in _Annalen der Physik_ between 1890 and 1900, in\r\nthe course of a memoir by Larmor, Phil. Trans., 1897, A, in Voigt's\r\n_Compendium der Physik_ and his more recent _Thermodynamik_, in Planck's\r\n_Vorlesungen uber Thermodynamik_, in Duhem's elaborate _Traite de\r\nmecanique chimique_ and _Le Potential thermodynamique_, in Whetham's\r\n_Theory of Solution_ and in Bryan's _Thermodynamics_. Numerous\r\napplications to special problems are expounded in van't Hoff's _Lectures\r\non Theoretical and Physical Chemistry_.\r\n\r\nThe theory of energetics, which puts a diminishing limit on the amount\r\nof energy available for mechanical purposes, is closely implicated in\r\nthe discovery of natural radioactive substances by H. Becquerel, and\r\ntheir isolation in the very potent form of radium salts by M. and Mme\r\nCurie. The slow degradation of radium has been found by the latter to be\r\nconcomitant with an evolution of heat, in amount enormous compared with\r\nother chemical changes. This heat has been shown by E. Rutherford to be\r\nabout what must be due to the stoppage of the [alpha] and [beta]\r\nparticles, which are emitted from the substance with velocities almost\r\nof the same scale as that of light. If they struck an ideal rigid\r\ntarget, their lost kinetic energy must all be sent away as radiation;\r\nbut when they become entangled among the molecules of actual matter, it\r\nwill, to a large extent, be shared among them as heat, with availability\r\nreduced accordingly. In any case the particles that escape into the\r\nsurrounding space are so few and their velocity so uniform that we can,\r\nto some extent, treat their energy as directly available mechanically,\r\nin contradistinction to the energy of individual molecules of a gas (cf.\r\nMaxwell's \"demons\"), e.g. for driving a vane, as in Crookes's experiment\r\nwith the cathode rays. Indeed, on account of the high velocity of\r\nprojection of the particles from a radium salt, the actions concerned\r\nwould find their equilibrium at such enormously high temperatures that\r\nany influence of actually available differences of temperature is not\r\nsensibly a feature of the phenomena. Such actions, however, like\r\nexplosive actions in general, are beyond our powers of actual _direct_\r\nmeasurement as regards the degradation of availability of the energy. It\r\nhas been pointed out by Rutherford, R.J. Strutt and others, that the\r\nenergy of degradation of even a very minute admixture of active radium\r\nwould entirely dominate and mask all other cosmical modes of\r\ntransformation of energy; for example, it far outweighs that arising\r\nfrom the exhaustion of gravitational energy, which has been shown by\r\nHelmholtz and Kelvin to be an ample source for all the activities of our\r\ncosmical system, and to be itself far greater than the energy of any\r\nordinary chemical rearrangements consequent on a fall of temperature: a\r\ncircumstance that makes the existence and properties of this substance\r\nunder settled cosmic conditions still more anomalous (see\r\nRADIOACTIVITY). Theoretically it is possible to obtain unlimited\r\nconcentration of availability of energy at the expense of an equivalent\r\namount of degradation spread over a wider field; the potency of electric\r\nfurnaces, which have recently opened up a new department of chemistry,\r\nand are limited only by the refractoriness of the materials of which\r\nthey are constituted, forms a case in point. In radium we have the very\r\nremarkable phenomenon of far higher concentration occurring naturally in\r\nvery minute permanent amounts, so that merely chemical sifting is needed\r\nto produce its aggregation. Even in pitchblende only one molecule in\r\n10^9 seems to be of radium, renewable, however, when lost, by internal\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\n  The energetics of RADIATION is treated under that heading. See also\r\n  THERMODYNAMICS.     (J. L.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENERGICI, or ENERGUMENS (Gr. \"possessed by a spirit\"), the name given in\r\nthe early Church to those suffering from different forms of insanity,\r\nwho were popularly supposed to be under the control of some indwelling\r\nspirit other than their own. Among primitive races everywhere disease is\r\nexplained in this way, and its removal supposed to be effected by\r\npriestly prayers and incantations. They were sometimes called [Greek:\r\nCheimazomenoi], as being \"tossed by the waves\" of uncontrollable\r\nimpulse. Persons afflicted in this way were restricted from entering the\r\nchurch, but might share the shelter of the porch with lepers and persons\r\nof offensive life (Hefele, _Conciliengeschichte_, vol. i. S 16). After\r\nthe prayers, if quiet, they might come in to receive the bishop's\r\nblessing (_Apost. Const_. viii. 6, 7, 32) and listen to the sermon. They\r\nwere daily fed and prayed over by the exorcists, and, in case of\r\nrecovery, after a fast of from 20 to 40 days, were admitted to the\r\neucharist, and their names and cures entered in the church records.\r\n\r\n  A note on the New Testament use of the word [Greek: energein] and its\r\n  cognates will be found in J.A. Robinson's edition of _The Epistle to\r\n  the Ephesians_, pp. 241-247; an excursus on \"The Conflict with Demons\"\r\n  in A. Harnack, _The Expansion of Christianity_, i. 152-180. Cf.\r\n  EXORCISM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENERGY (from the Gr. [Greek: energeia]; [Greek: en], in, [Greek: ergon],\r\nwork), in physical science, a term which may be defined as accumulated\r\nmechanical work, which, however, may be only partially available for\r\nuse. A bent spring possesses energy, for it is capable of doing work in\r\nreturning to its natural form; a charge of gunpowder possesses energy,\r\nfor it is capable of doing work in exploding; a Leyden jar charged with\r\nelectricity possesses energy, for it is capable of doing work in being\r\ndischarged. The motions of bodies, or of the ultimate parts of bodies,\r\nalso involve energy, for stopping them would be a source of work.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of energy are ultimately measured in terms of work. If we\r\nraise 1 lb. of matter through a foot we do a certain amount of work\r\nagainst the earth's attraction; if we raise 2 lb. through the same\r\nheight we do twice this amount of work, and so on. Also, the work done\r\nin raising 1 lb. through 2 ft. will be double of that done in raising it\r\n1 ft. Thus we recognize that the work done varies as the resistance\r\novercome and the distance through which it is overcome conjointly.\r\n\r\nNow, we may select any definite quantity of work we please as our unit,\r\nas, for example, the work done in lifting a pound a foot high from the\r\nsea-level in the latitude of London, which is the unit of work generally\r\nadopted by British engineers, and is called the \"foot-pound.\" The most\r\nappropriate unit for scientific purposes is one which depends only on\r\nthe fundamental units of length, mass and time, and is hence called an\r\nabsolute unit. Such a unit is independent of gravity or of any other\r\nquantity which varies with the locality. Taking the centimetre, gramme\r\nand second as our fundamental units, the most convenient unit of force\r\nis that which, acting on a gramme for a second, produces in it a\r\nvelocity of a centimetre per second; this is called a Dyne. The unit of\r\nwork is that which is required to overcome a resistance of a dyne over a\r\ncentimetre, and is called an Erg. In the latitude of Paris the dyne is\r\nequal to the weight of about 1/981 of a gramme, and the erg is the\r\namount of work required to raise 1/981 of a gramme vertically through\r\none centimetre.\r\n\r\nEnergy is the capacity for doing work. The unit of energy should\r\ntherefore be the same as that of work, and the centimetre-gramme-second\r\n(C.G.S.) unit of energy is the erg.\r\n\r\nThe forms of energy which are most readily recognized are of course\r\nthose in which the energy can be most directly employed in doing\r\nmechanical work; and it is manifest that masses of matter which are\r\nlarge enough to be seen and handled are more readily dealt with\r\nmechanically than are smaller masses. Hence when useful work can be\r\nobtained from a system by simply connecting visible portions of it by a\r\ntrain of mechanism, such energy is more readily recognized than is that\r\nwhich would compel us to control the behaviour of molecules before we\r\ncould transform it into useful work. This leads up to the fundamental\r\ndistinction, introduced by Lord Kelvin, between \"available energy,\"\r\nwhich we can turn to mechanical effect, and \"diffuse energy,\" which is\r\nuseless for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe conception of work and of energy was originally derived from\r\nobservation of purely mechanical phenomena, that is to say, phenomena in\r\nwhich the relative positions and motions of visible portions of matter\r\nwere all that were taken into consideration. Hence it is not surprising\r\nthat, in those more subtle forms in which energy cannot be readily or\r\ncompletely converted into work, the universality of the principle of\r\nenergy, its conservation, as regards amount, should for a long while\r\nhave escaped recognition after it had become familiar in pure dynamics.\r\n\r\nIf a pound weight be suspended by a string passing over pulley, in\r\ndescending through 10 ft. it is capable of raising nearly a pound weight\r\nattached to the other end of the string, through the same height, and\r\nthus can do nearly 10 foot-pounds of work. The smoother we make the\r\npulley the more nearly does the amount of useful work which the weight\r\nis capable of doing approach 10 foot-pounds, and if we take into account\r\nthe work done against the friction of the pulley, we may say that the\r\nwork done by the descending weight is 10 foot-pounds, and hence when the\r\nweight is in its elevated position we have at disposal 10 foot-pounds\r\nmore energy than when it is in the lower position. It should be noticed,\r\nhowever, that this energy is possessed by the system consisting of the\r\nearth and pound together, in virtue of their separation, and that\r\nneither could do work without the other to attract it. The system\r\nconsisting of the earth and the pound therefore possesses an amount of\r\nenergy which depends on the relative positions of its two parts, on\r\naccount of the latent physical connexion existing between them. In most\r\nmechanical systems the working stresses acting between the parts can be\r\ndetermined when the relative positions of all the parts are known; and\r\nthe energy which a system possesses in virtue of the relative positions\r\nof its parts, or its _configuration_, is classified as \"potential\r\nenergy,\" to distinguish it from energy of motion which we shall\r\npresently consider. The word potential does not imply that this energy\r\nis not real; it exists in potentiality only in the sense that it is\r\nstored away in some latent manner; but it can be drawn upon without\r\nlimit for mechanical work.\r\n\r\nIt is a fundamental result in dynamics that, if a body be projected\r\nvertically upwards _in vacuo_, with a velocity of v centimetres per\r\nsecond, it will rise to a height of v^2/2g centimetres, where g\r\nrepresents the numerical value of the acceleration produced by gravity\r\nin centimetre-second units. Now, if m represent the mass of the body in\r\ngrammes its weight will be mg dynes, for it will require a force of mg\r\ndynes to produce in it the acceleration denoted by g. Hence the work\r\ndone in raising the mass will be represented by mg.v^2/2g, that is, 1/2\r\nmv^2 _ergs_. Now, whatever be the direction in which a body is moving, a\r\nfrictionless constraint, like a string attached to the body, can cause\r\nits velocity to be changed into the vertical direction without any\r\nchange taking place in the magnitude of the velocity. Thus it is merely\r\nin virtue of the velocity that the mass is capable of rising against the\r\nresistance of gravity, and hence we recognize that on account of its\r\nmotion the body possessed 1/2 mv^2 units of energy. Energy of motion is\r\nusually called \"kinetic energy.\"\r\n\r\nA simple example of the transformation of kinetic energy into potential\r\nenergy, and vice versa, is afforded by the pendulum. When at the limits\r\nof its swing, the pendulum is for an instant at rest, and all the energy\r\nof the oscillation is static or potential. When passing through its\r\nposition of equilibrium, since gravity can do no more work upon it\r\nwithout changing its fixed point of support, all the energy of\r\noscillation is kinetic. At intermediate positions the energy is partly\r\nkinetic and partly potential.\r\n\r\nAvailable kinetic energy is possessed by a system of two or more bodies\r\nin virtue of the relative motion of its parts. Since our conception of\r\nvelocity is essentially relative, it is plain that any property\r\npossessed by a body in virtue of its motion can be effectively possessed\r\nby it only in relation to those bodies with respect to which it is\r\nmoving. If a body whose mass is m grammes be moving with a velocity of v\r\ncentimetres per second relative to the earth, the available kinetic\r\nenergy possessed by the system is 1/2 mv^2 ergs if m be small relative\r\nto the earth. But if we consider two bodies each of mass m and one of\r\nthem moving with velocity v relative to the other, only 1/4 mv^2 units\r\nof work is available from this system alone. Thus the estimation of\r\nkinetic energy is intimately affected by the choice of our base of\r\nmeasurement.\r\n\r\nWhen the stresses acting between the parts of a system depend _only_ on\r\nthe relative positions of those parts, the sum of the kinetic energy and\r\npotential energy of the system is always the same, provided the system\r\nbe not acted upon by anything outside it. Such a system is called\r\n\"conservative,\" and is well illustrated by the swinging pendulum above\r\nreferred to. But there are stresses which depend on the relative\r\n_motion_ of the visible bodies between which they appear to act. When\r\nwork is done against these forces no full equivalent of potential\r\nenergy may be produced; this applies especially to frictional forces,\r\nfor if the motion of the system be reversed the forces will be also\r\nreversed and will still oppose the motion. It was long believed that\r\nwork done against such forces was lost, and it was not till the 19th\r\ncentury that the energy thus transformed was traced; the conservation of\r\nenergy has become the master-key to unlock the connexions in inanimate\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out by Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and P.G. Tait that Newton\r\nhad divined the principle of the conservation of energy, so far as it\r\nbelongs purely to mechanics. But what became of the work done against\r\nfriction and such non-conservative forces remained obscure, while the\r\nchemical doctrine that heat was an indestructible substance afterwards\r\nled to the idea that it was lost. There was, however, even before\r\nNewton's time, more than a suspicion that heat was a form of energy.\r\nFrancis Bacon expressed his conviction that heat consists of a kind of\r\nmotion or \"brisk agitation\" of the particles of matter. In the _Novum\r\nOrganum_, after giving a long list of the sources of heat, he says:\r\n\"From these examples, taken collectively as well as singly, the nature\r\nwhose limit is heat appears to be motion.... It must not be thought that\r\nheat generates motion or motion heat (though in some respects this is\r\ntrue), but the very essence of heat, or the substantial self of heat, is\r\nmotion and nothing else.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Newton's time the first vigorous effort to restore the\r\nuniversality of the doctrine of energy was made by Benjamin Thompson,\r\nCount Rumford, and was published in the _Phil. Trans_. for 1798. Rumford\r\nwas engaged in superintending the boring of cannon in the military\r\narsenal at Munich, and was struck by the amount of heat produced by the\r\naction of the boring bar upon the brass castings. In order to see\r\nwhether the heat came out of the chips he compared the capacity for heat\r\nof the chips abraded by the boring bar with that of an equal quantity of\r\nthe metal cut from the block by a fine saw, and obtained the same result\r\nin the two cases, from which he concluded that \"the heat produced could\r\nnot possibly have been furnished at the expense of the latent heat of\r\nthe metallic chips.\"\r\n\r\nRumford then turned up a hollow cylinder which was cast in one piece\r\nwith a brass six-pounder, and having reduced the connexion between the\r\ncylinder and cannon to a narrow neck of metal, he caused a blunt borer\r\nto press against the hollow of the cylinder with a force equal to the\r\nweight of about 10,000 lb., while the casting was made to rotate in a\r\nlathe. By this means the mean temperature of the brass was raised\r\nthrough about 70 deg. Fahr., while the amount of metal abraded was only\r\n837 grains.\r\n\r\nIn order to be sure that the heat was not due to the action of the air\r\nupon the newly exposed metallic surface, the cylinder and the end of the\r\nboring bar were immersed in 18.77 lb. of water contained in an oak box.\r\nThe temperature of the water at the commencement of the experiment was\r\n60 deg. Fahr., and after two horses had turned the lathe for 2-1/2 hours\r\nthe water boiled. Taking into account the heat absorbed by the box and\r\nthe metal, Rumford calculated that the heat developed was sufficient to\r\nraise 26.58 lb. of water from the freezing to the boiling point, and in\r\nthis calculation the heat lost by radiation and conduction was\r\nneglected. Since one horse was capable of doing the work required,\r\nRumford remarked that one horse can generate heat as rapidly as nine wax\r\ncandles burning in the ordinary manner.\r\n\r\nFinally, Rumford reviewed all the sources from which the heat might have\r\nbeen supposed to be derived, and concluded that it was simply produced\r\nby the friction, and that the supply was inexhaustible. \"It is hardly\r\nnecessary to add,\" he remarks, \"that anything which any insulated body\r\nor system of bodies can continue to furnish _without limitation_ cannot\r\npossibly be a _material substance_; and it appears to me to be extremely\r\ndifficult, if not quite impossible, to form any distinct idea of\r\nanything capable of being excited and communicated in the manner that\r\nheat was excited and communicated in these experiments, except it be\r\n_motion_.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Davy showed that two pieces of ice could be melted\r\nby rubbing them together in a vacuum, although everything surrounding\r\nthem was at a temperature below the freezing point. He did not, however,\r\ninfer that since the heat could not have been supplied by the ice, for\r\nice absorbs heat in melting, this experiment afforded conclusive proof\r\nagainst the substantial nature of heat.\r\n\r\nThough we may allow that the results obtained by Rumford and Davy\r\ndemonstrate satisfactorily that heat is in some way due to motion, yet\r\nthey do not tell us to what particular dynamical quantity heat\r\ncorresponds. For example, does the heat generated by friction vary as\r\nthe friction and the time during which it acts, or is it proportional to\r\nthe friction and the distance through which the rubbing bodies are\r\ndisplaced--that is, to the work done against friction--or does it\r\ninvolve any other conditions? If it can be shown that, however the\r\nduration and all other conditions of the experiment may be varied, the\r\nsame amount of heat can in the end be always produced when the same\r\namount of _energy_ is expended, then, and only then, can we infer that\r\nheat is a form of energy, and that the energy consumed has been really\r\ntransformed into heat. This was left for J.P. Joule to achieve; his\r\nexperiments conclusively prove that heat and energy are of the same\r\nnature, and that all other forms of energy can be transformed into an\r\nequivalent amount of heat.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of energy which, if entirely converted into heat, is\r\ncapable of raising the temperature of the unit mass of water from 0 deg.\r\nC. to 1 deg. C. is called the mechanical equivalent of heat. One of the\r\nfirst who took in hand the determination of the mechanical equivalent of\r\nheat was Marc. Seguin, a nephew of J.M. Montgolfier. He argued that, if\r\nheat be energy, then, when it is employed in doing work, as in a\r\nsteam-engine, some of the heat must itself be consumed in the operation.\r\nHence he inferred that the amount of heat given up to the condenser of\r\nan engine when the engine is doing work must be less than when the same\r\namount of steam is blown through the engine without doing any work.\r\nSeguin was unable to verify this experimentally, but in 1857 G.A. Hirn\r\nsucceeded, not only in showing that such a difference exists, but in\r\nmeasuring it, and hence determining a tolerably approximate value of the\r\nmechanical equivalent of heat. In 1839 Seguin endeavoured to determine\r\nthe mechanical equivalent of heat from the loss of heat suffered by\r\nsteam in expanding, _assuming_ that the whole of the heat so lost was\r\nconsumed in doing external work against the pressure to which the steam\r\nwas exposed. This assumption, however, cannot be justified, because it\r\nneglected to take account of work which might possibly have to be done\r\n_within the steam itself_ during the expansion.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 R. Mayer, a physician at Heilbronn, published an attempt to\r\ndetermine the mechanical equivalent of heat from the heat produced when\r\nair is compressed. Mayer made an assumption the converse of that of\r\nSeguin, asserting that the whole of the work done in compressing the air\r\nwas converted into heat, and neglecting the possibility of heat being\r\nconsumed in doing work within the air itself or being produced by the\r\ntransformation of internal potential energy. Joule afterwards proved\r\n(see below) that Mayer's assumption was in accordance with fact, so that\r\nhis method was a sound one as far as experiment was concerned; and it\r\nwas only on account of the values of the specific heats of air at\r\nconstant pressure and at constant volume employed by him being very\r\ninexact that the value of the mechanical equivalent of heat obtained by\r\nMayer was very far from the truth.\r\n\r\nPassing over L.A. Colding, who in 1843 presented to the Royal Society of\r\nCopenhagen a paper entitled \"Theses concerning Force,\" which clearly\r\nstated the \"principle of the perpetuity of energy,\" and who also\r\nperformed a series of experiments for the purpose of determining the\r\nheat developed by the compression of various bodies, which entitle him\r\nto be mentioned among the founders of the modern theory of energy, we\r\ncome to Dr James Prescott Joule of Manchester, to whom we are indebted\r\nmore than to any other for the establishment of the principle of the\r\nconservation of energy on the broad basis on which it has since stood.\r\nThe best-known of Joule's experiments was that in which a brass paddle\r\nconsisting of eight arms rotated in a cylindrical vessel of water\r\ncontaining four fixed vanes, which allowed the passage of the arms of\r\nthe paddle but prevented the water from rotating as a whole. The paddle\r\nwas driven by weights, and the temperature of the water was observed by\r\nthermometers which could indicate 1/200th of a degree Fahrenheit.\r\nSpecial experiments were made to determine the work done against\r\nresistances outside the vessel of water, which amounted to about .006 of\r\nthe whole, and corrections were made for the loss of heat by radiation,\r\nthe buoyancy of the air affecting the descending weights, and the energy\r\ndissipated when the weights struck the floor with a finite velocity.\r\nFrom these experiments Joule obtained 72.692 foot-pounds in the latitude\r\nof Manchester as equivalent to the amount of heat required to raise 1\r\nlb. of water through 1 deg. Fahr, from the freezing point. Adopting the\r\ncentigrade scale, this gives 1390.846 foot-pounds.\r\n\r\nWith an apparatus similar to the above, but smaller, made of iron and\r\nfilled with mercury, Joule obtained results varying from 772.814\r\nfoot-pounds when driving weights of about 58 lb. were employed to\r\n775.352 foot-pounds when the driving weights were only about 19-1/2 lb.\r\nBy causing two conical surfaces of cast-iron immersed in mercury and\r\ncontained in an iron vessel to rub against one another when pressed\r\ntogether by a lever, Joule obtained 776.045 foot-pounds for the\r\nmechanical equivalent of heat when the heavy weights were used, and\r\n774.93 foot-pounds with the small driving weights. In this experiment a\r\ngreat noise was produced, corresponding to a loss of energy, and Joule\r\nendeavoured to determine the amount of energy necessary to produce an\r\nequal amount of sound from the string of a violoncello and to apply a\r\ncorresponding correction.\r\n\r\nThe close agreement between the results at least indicates that \"the\r\namount of heat produced by friction is proportional to the work done and\r\nindependent of the nature of the rubbing surfaces.\" Joule inferred from\r\nthem that the mechanical equivalent of heat is probably about 772\r\nfoot-pounds, or, employing the centigrade scale, about 1390 foot-pounds.\r\n\r\nPrevious to determining the mechanical equivalent of heat by the most\r\naccurate experimental method at his command, Joule established a series\r\nof cases in which the production of one kind of energy was accompanied\r\nby a disappearance of some other form. In 1840 he showed that when an\r\nelectric current was produced by means of a dynamo-magneto-electric\r\nmachine the heat generated in the conductor, when no external work was\r\ndone by the current, was the same as if the energy employed in producing\r\nthe current had been converted into heat by friction, thus showing that\r\nelectric currents conform to the principle of the conservation of\r\nenergy, since energy can neither be created nor destroyed by them. He\r\nalso determined a roughly approximate value for the mechanical\r\nequivalent of heat from the results of these experiments. Extending his\r\ninvestigations to the currents produced by batteries, he found that the\r\ntotal voltaic heat generated in any circuit was proportional to the\r\nnumber of electrochemical equivalents electrolysed in each cell\r\nmultiplied by the electromotive force of the battery. Now, we know that\r\nthe number of electrochemical equivalents electrolysed is proportional\r\nto the whole amount of electricity which passed through the circuit, and\r\nthe product of this by the electromotive force of the battery is the\r\nwork done by the latter, so that in this case also Joule showed that the\r\nheat generated was proportional to the work done.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 and 1845 Joule published a series of researches on the\r\ncompression and expansion of air. A metal vessel was placed in a\r\ncalorimeter and air forced into it, the amount of energy expended in\r\ncompressing the air being measured. Assuming that the whole of the\r\nenergy was converted into heat, when the air was subjected to a pressure\r\nof 21.5 atmospheres Joule obtained for the mechanical equivalent of heat\r\nabout 824.8 foot-pounds, and when a pressure of only 10.5 atmospheres\r\nwas employed the result was 796.9 foot-pounds.\r\n\r\nIn the next experiment the air was compressed as before, and then\r\nallowed to escape through a long lead tube immersed in the water of a\r\ncalorimeter, and finally collected in a bell jar. The amount of heat\r\nabsorbed by the air could thus be measured, while the work done by it in\r\nexpanding could be readily calculated. In allowing the air to expand\r\nfrom a pressure of 21 atmospheres to that of 1 atmosphere the value of\r\nthe mechanical equivalent of heat obtained was 821.89 foot-pounds.\r\nBetween 10 atmospheres and 1 it was 815.875 foot-pounds, and between 23\r\nand 14 atmospheres 761.74 foot-pounds.\r\n\r\nBut, unlike Mayer and Seguin, Joule was not content with assuming that\r\nwhen air is compressed or allowed to expand the heat generated or\r\nabsorbed is the equivalent of the work done and of that only, no change\r\nbeing made in the internal energy of the air itself when the temperature\r\nis kept constant. To test this two vessels similar to that used in the\r\nlast experiment were placed in the same calorimeter and connected by a\r\ntube with a stop-cock. One contained air at a pressure of 22\r\natmospheres, while the other was exhausted. On opening the stop-cock no\r\nwork was done by the expanding air against external forces, since it\r\nexpanded into a vacuum, and it was found that no heat was generated or\r\nabsorbed. This showed that Mayer's assumption was true. On repeating the\r\nexperiment when the two vessels were placed in different calorimeters,\r\nit was found that heat was absorbed by the vessel containing the\r\ncompressed air, while an equal quantity of heat was produced in the\r\ncalorimeter containing the exhausted vessel. The heat absorbed was\r\nconsumed in giving motion to the issuing stream of air, and was\r\nreproduced by the impact of the particles on the sides of the exhausted\r\nvessel. The subsequent researches of Dr Joule and Lord Kelvin (_Phil.\r\nTrans_., 1853, p. 357, 1854, p. 321, and 1862, p. 579) showed that the\r\nstatement that no _internal work_ is done when a gas expands or\r\ncontracts is not quite true, but the amount is very small in the cases\r\nof those gases which, like oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, can only be\r\nliquefied by intense cold and pressure.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the final result deduced by Joule by these varied and\r\ncareful investigations was accepted as the standard value of the\r\nmechanical equivalent of heat. Recent determinations by H.A. Rowland and\r\nothers, necessitated by modern requirements, have shown that it is in\r\nerror, but by less than 1%. The writings of Joule, which thus occupy the\r\nplace of honour in the practical establishment of the conservation of\r\nenergy, have been collected into two volumes published by the Physical\r\nSociety of London. On the theoretical side the greatest stimulus came\r\nfrom the publication in 1847, without knowledge of Mayer or Joule, of\r\nHelmholtz's great memoir, _Uber die Erhaltung der Kraft_, followed\r\nimmediately (1848-1852) by the establishment of the science of\r\nthermodynamics (q.v.), mainly by R. Clausius and Lord Kelvin on the\r\nbasis of \"Carnot's principle\" (1824), modified in expression so as to be\r\nconsistent with the conservation of energy (see ENERGETICS).\r\n\r\nThough we can convert the whole of the energy possessed by any\r\nmechanical system into heat, it is not in our power to perform the\r\ninverse operation, and to utilize the whole of the heat in doing\r\nmechanical work. Thus we see that different forms of energy are not\r\nequally valuable for conversion into work. The ratio of the portion of\r\nthe energy of a system which can under given conditions be converted\r\ninto mechanical work to the whole amount of energy operated upon may be\r\ncalled the \"availability\" of the energy. If a system be removed from all\r\ncommunication with anything outside of itself, the whole amount of\r\nenergy possessed by it will remain constant, but will of its own accord\r\ntend to undergo such transformations as will diminish its availability.\r\nThis general law, known as the principle of the \"dissipation of energy,\"\r\nwas first adequately pointed out by Lord Kelvin in 1852; and was applied\r\nby him to some of the principal problems of cosmical physics. Though\r\ncontrolling all phenomena of which we have any experience, the principle\r\nof the dissipation of energy rests on a very different foundation from\r\nthat of the conservation of energy; for while we may conceive of no\r\nmeans of circumventing the latter principle, it seems that the actions\r\nof intelligent beings are subject to the former only in consequence of\r\nthe rudeness of the machinery which they have at their disposal for\r\ncontrolling the behaviour of those ultimate portions of matter, in\r\nvirtue of the motions or positions of which the energy with which they\r\nhave to deal exists. If we have a weight capable of falling through a\r\ncertain distance, we can employ the mutual forces of the system\r\nconsisting of the earth and weight to do an amount of useful work which\r\nis less than the full amount of potential energy possessed by the system\r\nonly in consequence of the friction of the constraints, so that the\r\nlimit of availability in this case is determined only by the friction\r\nwhich is unavoidable. Here we have to deal with a transformation with\r\nwhich we can grapple, and which can be controlled for our purposes. If,\r\non the other hand, we have to deal with a system of molecules of whose\r\nmotions in the aggregate we become conscious only by indirect means,\r\nwhile we know absolutely nothing either of the motions or positions of\r\nany individual molecule, it is obvious that we cannot grasp single\r\nmolecules and control their movements so as to derive the full amount of\r\nwork from the system. All we can do in such cases is to place the system\r\nunder certain conditions of transformation, and be content with the\r\namount of work which it is, as it were, willing to render up under those\r\nconditions. Thus the principle of Carnot involves the conclusion that a\r\ngreater proportion of the heat possessed by a body at a high temperature\r\ncan be converted into work than in the case of an equal quantity of heat\r\npossessed by a body at a low temperature, so that the availability of\r\nheat increases with the temperature.\r\n\r\nClerk Maxwell supposed two compartments, A and B, to be filled with gas\r\nat the same temperature, and to be separated by an ideal, infinitely\r\nthin partition containing a number of exceedingly small trap-doors, each\r\nof which could be opened or closed without any expenditure of energy. An\r\nintelligent creature, or \"demon,\" possessed of unlimited powers of\r\nvision, is placed in charge of each door, with instructions to open the\r\ndoor whenever a particle in A comes towards it with more than a certain\r\nvelocity V, and to keep it closed against all particles in A moving with\r\nless than this velocity, but, on the other hand, to open the door\r\nwhenever a particle in B approaches it with less than a certain velocity\r\nv, which is not greater than V, and to keep it closed against all\r\nparticles in B moving with a greater velocity than this. By continuing\r\nthis process every unit of mass which enters B will carry with it more\r\nenergy than each unit which leaves B, and hence the temperature of the\r\ngas in B will be raised and that of the gas in A lowered, while no heat\r\nis lost and no energy expended; so that by the application of\r\nintelligence alone a portion of gas of uniform pressure and temperature\r\nmay be sifted into two parts, in which both the temperature and the\r\npressure are different, and from which, therefore, work can be obtained\r\nat the expense of heat. This shows that the principle of the dissipation\r\nof energy has control over the actions of those agents only whose\r\nfaculties are too gross to enable them to grapple individually with the\r\nminute portions of matter which are the seat of energy.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 Lord Rayleigh published an investigation on \"the work which may\r\nbe gained during the mixing of gases.\" In the preface he states the\r\nposition that \"whenever, then, two gases are allowed to mix without the\r\nperformance of work, there is dissipation of energy, and an opportunity\r\nof doing work at the expense of low temperature heat has been for ever\r\nlost.\" He shows that the amount of work obtainable is equal to that\r\nwhich can be done by the first gas in expanding into the space occupied\r\nby the second (supposed vacuous) together with that done by the second\r\nin expanding into the space occupied by the first. In the experiment\r\nimagined by Lord Rayleigh a porous diaphragm takes the place of the\r\npartition and trap-doors imagined by Clerk Maxwell, and the molecules\r\nsort themselves automatically on account of the difference in their\r\naverage velocities for the two gases. When the pressure on one side of\r\nthe diaphragm thus becomes greater than that on the other, work may be\r\ndone at the expense of heat in pushing the diaphragm, and the operation\r\ncarried on with continual gain of work until the gases are uniformly\r\ndiffused. There is this difference, however, between this experiment and\r\nthe operation imagined by Maxwell, that when the gases have diffused the\r\nexperiment cannot be repeated; and it is no more contrary to the\r\ndissipation of energy than is the fact that work may be derived at the\r\nexpense of heat when a gas expands into a vacuum, for the working\r\nsubstance is not finally restored to its original condition; while\r\nMaxwell's \"demons\" may operate without limit.\r\n\r\nIn such experiments the molecular energy of a gas is converted into work\r\nonly in virtue of the molecules being separated into classes in which\r\ntheir velocities are different, and these classes then allowed to act\r\nupon one another through the intervention of a suitable heat-engine.\r\nThis sorting can occur spontaneously to a limited extent; while if we\r\ncould carry it out as far as we pleased we might transform the whole of\r\nthe heat of a body into work. The theoretical availability of heat is\r\nlimited only by our power of bringing those particles whose motions\r\nconstitute heat in bodies to rest relatively to one another; and we have\r\nprecisely similar practical limits to the availability of the energy due\r\nto the motion of visible and tangible bodies, though theoretically we\r\ncan then trace all the stages.\r\n\r\nIf a battery of electromotive force E maintain a current C in a\r\nconductor, and no other electromotive force exist in the circuit, the\r\nwhole of the work done will be converted into heat, and the amount of\r\nwork done per second will be EC. If R denote the resistance of the whole\r\ncircuit, E = CR, and the heat generated per second is C^2R. If the\r\ncurrent drive an electromagnetic engine, the reaction of the engine will\r\nproduce an electromotive force opposing the current. Suppose the current\r\nto be thus reduced to C'. Then the work done by the battery per second\r\nwill be EC' or CC'R, while the heat generated per second will be C'^2R,\r\nso that we have the difference (C-C')C'R for the energy consumed in\r\ndriving the engine. The ratio of this to the whole work done by the\r\nbattery is (C-C')/C, so that the efficiency is increased by diminishing\r\nC'. If we could drive the engine so fast as to reduce C' to zero, the\r\nwhole of the energy of the battery would be available, no heat being\r\nproduced in the wires, but the horse-power of the engine would be\r\nindefinitely small. The reason why the whole of the energy of the\r\ncurrent is not available is that heat must always be generated in a wire\r\nin which a finite current is flowing, so that, in the case of a battery\r\nin which the whole of the energy of chemical affinity is employed in\r\nproducing a current, the availability of the energy is limited only on\r\naccount of the resistance of the conductors, and may be increased by\r\ndiminishing this resistance. The availability of the energy of\r\nelectrical separation in a charged Leyden jar is also limited only by\r\nthe resistance of conductors, in virtue of which an amount of heat is\r\nnecessarily produced, which is greater the less the time occupied in\r\ndischarging the jar. The availability of the energy of magnetization is\r\nlimited by the coercive force of the magnetized material, in virtue of\r\nwhich any change in the intensity of magnetization is accompanied by the\r\nproduction of heat.\r\n\r\nIn all cases there is a general tendency for other forms of energy to be\r\ntransformed into heat on account of the friction of rough surfaces, the\r\nresistance of conductors, or similar causes, and thus to lose\r\navailability. In some cases, as when heat is converted into the kinetic\r\nenergy of moving machinery or the potential energy of raised weights,\r\nthere is an ascent of energy from the less available form of heat to the\r\nmore available form of mechanical energy, but in all cases this is\r\naccompanied by the transfer of other heat from a body at a high\r\ntemperature to one at a lower temperature, thus losing availability to\r\nan extent that more than compensates for the rise.\r\n\r\nIt is practically important to consider the rate at which energy may be\r\ntransformed into useful work, or the horse-power of the agent. It\r\ngenerally happens that to obtain the greatest possible amount of work\r\nfrom a given supply of energy, and to obtain it at the greatest rate,\r\nare conflicting interests. We have seen that the _efficiency_ of an\r\nelectromagnetic engine is greatest when the current is indefinitely\r\nsmall, and then the rate at which it works is also indefinitely small.\r\nM.H. von Jacobi showed that for a given electromotive force in the\r\nbattery the horse-power is greatest when the current is reduced to\r\none-half of what it would be if the engine were at rest. A similar\r\ncondition obtains in the steam-engine, in which a great rate of working\r\nnecessitates the dissipation of a large amount of energy.\r\n     (W. G.; J. L.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENFANTIN, BARTHELEMY PROSPER (1796-1864), French social reformer, one of\r\nthe founders of Saint-Simonism, was born at Paris on the 8th of February\r\n1796. He was the son of a banker of Dauphiny, and after receiving his\r\nearly education at a lyceum, was sent in 1813 to the Ecole\r\nPolytechnique. In March 1814 he was one of the band of students who, on\r\nthe heights of Montmartre and Saint-Chaumont, attempted resistance to\r\nthe armies of the allies then engaged in the investment of Paris. In\r\nconsequence of this outbreak of patriotic enthusiasm, the school was\r\nsoon after closed by Louis XVIII., and the young student was compelled\r\nto seek some other career instead of that of the soldier. He first\r\nengaged himself to a country wine merchant, for whom he travelled in\r\nGermany, Russia and the Netherlands. In 1821 he entered a banking-house\r\nnewly established at St Petersburg, but returned two years later to\r\nParis, where he was appointed cashier to the Caisse Hypothecaire. At the\r\nsame time he became a member of the secret society of the Carbonari. In\r\n1825 a new turn was given to his thoughts and his life by the friendship\r\nwhich he formed with Olinde Rodriguez, who introduced him to\r\nSaint-Simon. He embraced the new doctrines with ardour, and by 1829 had\r\nbecome one of the acknowledged heads of the sect (see SAINT-SIMON).\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolution of 1830 Enfantin resigned his office of cashier,\r\nand devoted himself wholly to his cause. Besides contributing to the\r\n_Globe_ newspaper, he made appeals to the people by systematic\r\npreaching, and organized centres of action in some of the principal\r\ncities of France. The headquarters in Paris were removed from the modest\r\nrooms in the Rue Taranne, and established in large halls near the\r\nBoulevard Italien. Enfantin and Bazard (q.v.) were proclaimed \"Peres\r\nSupremes.\" This union of the supreme fathers, however, was only nominal.\r\nA divergence was already manifest, which rapidly increased to serious\r\ndifference and dissension. Bazard had devoted himself to political\r\nreform, Enfantin to social and moral change; Bazard was organizer and\r\ngovernor, Enfantin was teacher and consoler; the former attracted\r\nreverence, the latter love. A hopeless antagonism arose between them,\r\nwhich was widened by Enfantin's announcement of his theory of the\r\nrelation of man and woman, which would substitute for the \"tyranny of\r\nmarriage\" a system of \"free love.\" Bazard now separated from his\r\ncolleague, and in his withdrawal was followed by all those whose chief\r\naim was philosophical and political. Enfantin thus became sole \"father,\"\r\nand the few who were chiefly attracted by his religious pretensions and\r\naims still adhered to him. New converts joined them, and Enfantin\r\nassumed that his followers in France numbered 40,000. He wore on his\r\nbreast a badge with his title of \"Pere,\" was spoken of by his preachers\r\nas \"the living law,\" declared, and probably believed, himself to be the\r\nchosen of God, and sent out emissaries in a quest of a woman predestined\r\nto be the \"female Messiah,\" and the mother of a new Saviour. The quest\r\nwas very costly and altogether fruitless. No such woman was\r\ndiscoverable. Meanwhile believers in Enfantin and his new religion were\r\nmultiplying in all parts of Europe. His extravagances and success at\r\nlength brought down upon him the hand of the law. Public morality was in\r\nperil, and in May 1832 the halls of the new sect were closed by the\r\ngovernment, and the father, with some of his followers, appeared before\r\nthe tribunals. He now retired to his estate at Menilmontant, near Paris,\r\nwhere with forty disciples, all of them men, he continued to carry out\r\nhis socialistic views. In August of the same year he was again arrested,\r\nand on his appearance in court he desired his defence to be undertaken\r\nby two women who were with him, alleging that the matter was of special\r\nconcern to women. This was of course refused. The trial occupied two\r\ndays and resulted in a verdict of guilty, and a sentence of imprisonment\r\nfor a year with a small fine.\r\n\r\nThis prosecution finally discredited the new society. Enfantin was\r\nreleased in a few months, and then, accompanied by some of his\r\nfollowers, he went to Egypt. He stayed there two years, and might have\r\nentered the service of the viceroy if he would have professed himself,\r\nas a few of his friends did, a Mahommedan. On his return to France, a\r\nsadder and practically a wiser man, he settled down to very prosaic\r\nwork. He became first a postmaster near Lyons, and in 1841 was\r\nappointed, through the influence of some of his friends who had risen to\r\nposts of power, member of a scientific commission on Algeria, which led\r\nhim to engage in researches concerning North Africa and colonization in\r\ngeneral. in 1845 he was appointed a director of the Paris & Lyons\r\nrailway. Three years later he established, in conjunction with\r\nDuveyrier, a daily journal, entitled _Le Credit_, which was discontinued\r\nin 1850. He was afterwards attached to the administration of the railway\r\nfrom Lyons to the Mediterranean. Father Enfantin held fast by his ideal\r\nto the end, but he had renounced the hope of giving it a local\r\nhabitation and a name in the degenerate obstinate world. His personal\r\ninfluence over those who associated with him was immense. \"He was a man\r\nof a noble presence, with finely formed and expressive features. He was\r\ngentle and insinuating in manner, and possessed a calm, graceful and\r\nwinning delivery\" (_Gent. Mag_., Jan. 1865). His evident sincerity, his\r\ngenuine enthusiasm, gave him his marvellous ascendancy. Not a few of his\r\ndisciples ranked afterwards amongst the most distinguished men of\r\nFrance. He died suddenly at Paris on the 1st of September 1864.\r\n\r\n  Amongst his works are--Doctrine de Saint-Simon (written in conjunction\r\n  with several of his followers), published in 1830, and several times\r\n  republished; _Economie politique et politique Saint-Simonienne_\r\n  (1831); _Correspondance politique_ (1835-1840); _Corresp. philos. et\r\n  religieuse_ (1843-1845); and _La Vie eternelle passee, presente,\r\n  future_ (1861). A large number of articles by his hand appeared in _Le\r\n  Producteur, L'Organisateur, Le Globe,_ and other periodicals. He also\r\n  wrote in 1832 _Le Livre nouveau_, intended as a substitute for the\r\n  Christian Scriptures, but it was not published.\r\n\r\n  See G. Weill, _L'Ecole Saint-Simonienne, son histoire, son influence,\r\n  jusqu' a nos jours_ (Paris, 1896).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENFIDAVILLE [_Dar-el-Bey_], a town of Tunisia, on the railway between\r\nTunis and Susa, 30 m. N.E. of the last-named place and 5 m. inland from\r\nthe Gulf of Hammamet. Enfidaville is the chief settlement on the Enfida\r\nestate, a property of over 300,000 acres in the Sahel district of\r\nTunisia, forming a rectangle between the towns of Hammamet, Susa,\r\nKairawan and Zaghwan. On this estate, devoted to the cultivation of\r\ncereals, olives, vines and to pasturage, are colonies of Europeans and\r\nnatives. At Enfidaville, where was, as its native name indicates, a\r\npalace of the beys of Tunis, there is a large horse-breeding\r\nestablishment and a much-frequented weekly market. About 5 m. N. of\r\nEnfidaville is Henshir Fraga (anc. _Uppenna_), where are ruins of a\r\nlarge fortress and of a church in which were found mosaics with epitaphs\r\nof various bishops and martyrs.\r\n\r\nThe Enfida estate was granted by the bey Mahommed-es-Sadok to his chief\r\nminister Khaireddin Pasha (q.v.) in return for the confirmation by the\r\nsultan of Turkey in 1871, through the instrumentality of the pasha, of\r\nthe right of succession to the beylik of members of Es-Sadok's family.\r\nWhen, some years later, Khaireddin left Tunisia for Constantinople he\r\nsold the estate to a Marseilles company, which resold it to the Societe\r\nFranco-africaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENFIELD, a township of Hartford county, Connecticut, U.S.A., in the N.\r\npart of the state, on the E. bank of the Connecticut river, 20 m. N. of\r\nHartford. It has an area of 35 sq. m., with three villages--Thompsonville,\r\nHazardville and Enfield. Pop. (1890) 7199; (1900) 6699 (1812\r\nforeign-born); (1910) 9719. Its principal manufactures are gunpowder,\r\ncarpets, brick, cotton press machinery, and coffin hardware. In Enfield\r\nand its vicinity much tobacco is grown. First settled in 1679, Enfield was\r\na part of the township of Springfield, Massachusetts, until 1683, when it\r\nwas made a separate township; in 1749 it became a part of Connecticut. At\r\na town meeting on the 11th of July 1774 it was resolved that \"a firm and\r\ninviolable union of our colonies is absolutely necessary for the defence\r\nof our civil rights,\" and that \"the most effectual measures to defeat the\r\nmachinations of the enemies of His Majesty's government and the liberties\r\nof America is to break off all commercial intercourse with Great Britain\r\nand the West Indies until these oppressive acts for raising a revenue in\r\nAmerica are repealed.\" A Shaker community was established in the township\r\nin 1781, at what is now called Shaker Station.\r\n\r\n  See Francis Olcutt Allen, _History of Enfield_ (Lancaster, Pa., 1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENFIELD, a market town in the Enfield parliamentary division of\r\nMiddlesex, England, 11 m. N. of London Bridge, on the Great Northern and\r\nGreat Eastern railways. Pop. of urban district, (1891) 31,536, (1901)\r\n42,738. It is picturesquely situated on the western slope of the Lea\r\nvalley, with a considerable extension towards the river, mainly\r\nconsisting of artisans' dwellings (Churchbury, Ponder's End, and Enfield\r\nHighway on the Old North Road). Great numbers of villas occupied by\r\nthose whose work lies in London have grown up; and many of the\r\ninhabitants are employed in the Royal Small Arms factory at Enfield\r\nLock. The church of St Andrew is mainly Perpendicular, but has Early\r\nEnglish portions; it contains several ancient monuments and brasses, and\r\nflanks the market-place, with its modern cross. Enfield Palace fronts\r\nthe High Street; it retains portions of the building of Edward VI., but\r\nhas been greatly altered. The grammer school, near the church, was\r\nfounded in 1557. The New River flows through the parish, and Sir Hugh\r\nMyddleton, its projector, was for some time resident here. Middleton\r\nHouse, named after him, is one of several fine mansions in the vicinity.\r\nOf these, Forty Hall, in splendidly timbered grounds, is from the\r\ndesigns of Inigo Jones; and a former mansion occupying the site of White\r\nWebbs House was suspected as the scene of the hatching of Gunpowder\r\nPlot. The parish is of great extent (12,653 acres).\r\n\r\nAn Anglo-Saxon derivation, signifying \"forest clearing,\" is indicated\r\nfor the name. Enfield Chase was a royal preserve, disafforested in 1777.\r\nThe principal manor of Enfield, which was held by Asgar, Edward the\r\nConfessor's master of horse, was in the hands of the Norman baron\r\nGeoffrey de Mandeville at the time of Domesday, and belonged to the\r\nBohun family in the 12th and 13th centuries. It came, by succession and\r\nmarriage, into the possession of the crown under Henry IV., and was\r\nincluded in the duchy of Lancaster. There were, however, seven other\r\nmanors, and of these one, Worcesters, came to the crown in the time of\r\nHenry VIII., whose children resided at the manor-house, Elsynge Hall.\r\nEdward VI., settling both manors upon the princess Elizabeth, rebuilt\r\nEnfield Palace for her. She was a frequent resident here not only before\r\nbut after her accession to the throne. About 1664 the palace was\r\noccupied as a school by Robert Uvedale (1642-1722), who was also an\r\neminent horticulturist, planted the magnificent cedar still standing in\r\nthe palace grounds, and formed a herbarium now in the Sloane collection\r\nat the British Museum. The town received grants of markets from Edward\r\nI. and James I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENFILADE (a French word, from _enfiler_, to thread, and so to pass\r\nthrough from end to end), a military term used to express the direction\r\nof fire along an enemy's line, or parapet. This species of fire is most\r\ndemoralizing and destructive, since, from its direction, very few guns\r\nor rifles can be brought to bear to meet it. If any considerable body of\r\nmen changes front, it immediately lays itself open to enfilade from the\r\nenemy whom it originally faced. Against entrenchments, or the parapets\r\nof fortifications, enfilade is still more effective, as the enemy is\r\ndeprived of the protection given by his works and is no better covered\r\nthan if he were in the open. Banks of earth, built perpendicular to the\r\nline of defence (called _traverses_), are usually employed to protect\r\nparapets or trenches against enfilade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGADINE (Ger. _Engadin_; Ital. _Engadina_; Ladin, _Engiadina_), the\r\nname of the upper or Swiss portion of the valley of the Inn, which forms\r\npart of the Swiss canton of the Grisons. Its length by carriage road\r\nfrom the Maloja plateau (5935 ft.) at its south-western end to\r\nMartinsbruck (3406 ft.) at its north-eastern extremity is about 59 m. It\r\nis to be noted that up to and including St Moritz (6037 ft., the\r\nhighest) all the villages (save Sils-Baseglia) at its south-western end\r\nare higher than the Maloja plateau itself. The uppermost portion of the\r\nvalley contains several lakes, which, as one descends, gradually\r\ndiminish in size, those of Sils, Silvaplana and St Moritz. But both the\r\nMaloja plateau and the south-western half of the lake of Sils belong to\r\nthe commune of Stampa in the Val Bregaglia, and are included in the\r\nBregaglia administrative district, so that, from a political point of\r\nview, Sils is the first village that is included in the Engadine. The\r\nrest of the Engadine forms the districts of the Upper Engadine with\r\neleven communes, and of the Inn (i.e. the Lower Engadine), subdivided\r\ninto the Ob Tasna, Remus, and Unter Tasna circles, and containing twelve\r\ncommunes.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the total population of the Engadine was 11,712, of whom 5429\r\nwere in the Upper Engadine and 6283 in the Lower Engadine. In point of\r\nreligion 8594 were Protestants (4923 in the Lower Engadine and 3671 in\r\nthe Upper Engadine), and 3086 Romanists (1728 in the Upper Engadine and\r\n1358 in the Lower Engadine), while there were 12 Jews in the Upper\r\nEngadine and 2 in the Lower Engadine: in the Upper Engadine the majority\r\nin each commune was Protestant (the Romanists strongest in St Moritz),\r\nas also in the case of the Lower Engadine, save Tarasp and Samnaun,\r\nwhere the Romanists prevail. In point of language 7609 inhabitants (5010\r\nin the Lower Engadine and 2599 in the Upper Engadine) spoke the curious\r\nLadin dialect (a survival of a primitive Romance tongue), and 2221\r\nGerman (1265 in the Upper Engadine and 956 in the Lower Engadine). The\r\ncapital of the Upper Engadine is Samaden (967 inhabitants), and that of\r\nthe Lower Engadine, Schuls (1117 inhabitants). In 1908 there were no\r\nrailways in the Engadine, save about 8 m. (from the mouth of the tunnel\r\npast Bevers and Samaden to St Moritz village) of the railway pierced\r\n(1898-1902) beneath (5987 ft.) the Albula Pass (7595 ft.), which now\r\naffords the easiest means of access from Coire to St Moritz (56 m.); but\r\nmany railways in and to the Engadine have been planned. The valley is\r\nreached by many passes (over which excellent carriage roads were\r\nconstructed 1820-1872). The Maloja (5935 ft.) is the route from\r\nChiavenna and the Lake of Como to the Upper Engadine, which is also\r\nreached from Coire by the Julier (7504 ft.) and the Albula Passes (7595\r\nft.) as well as from Tirano in the Valtellina by the Bernina Pass (7645\r\nft.). On the other hand, the Lower Engadine is accessible from Davos\r\nover the Fluela Pass (7838 ft.) and from Mals at the head of the Adige\r\nvalley (or the Vintschgau) by the Ofen Pass (7071 ft.), while from\r\nMartinsbruck, the last Swiss village, a carriage road leads up to\r\nNauders (5 m.), whence it is 27 m. by road down the Inn valley to\r\nLandeck on the Arlberg railway, or 17-1/2 m. over the Reschen Scheideck\r\nPass (4902 ft.) to Mals in the Vintschgau.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Engadine consists of a long, straight, nearly level trough of\r\n26 m., varying from a mile to half a mile in breadth, through which\r\nflows the Inn. On the south-east this trough is limited by the lofty\r\nglacier-clad Bernina group (culminating in the Piz Bernina, 13,304 ft.)\r\nand the range rising between the Inn valley and that of Livigno to the\r\nsouth-east, while on the north-west the boundary is the extensive Albula\r\ngroup (culminating in Piz Kesch, 11,228 ft.). The Lower Engadine is far\r\nmore picturesque and romantic than the Upper Engadine, the Inn valley\r\nbeing here much narrower and the fall greater. On its north-west rises\r\nthe last bit of the Albula group (culminating in Piz Vadret, 10,584\r\nft.), and on the north the Silvretta group (culminating in Piz Linard,\r\n11,201 ft.), while to the east and south are the ranges on either side\r\nof the Ofen Pass (culminating in Piz Sesvenna, 10,568 ft.). In the Upper\r\nEngadine the villages are on the floor of the valley, but in the Lower\r\nEngadine many are perched high above the bed of the river on terraces,\r\nand are cut off from each other by deep ravines.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Engadine is far better known to foreign visitors than the\r\nLower Engadine, and is consequently much richer and more prosperous. The\r\nmineral waters of St Moritz (q.v.) were known and employed in the 16th\r\ncentury, and long formed the great attraction of the region. But about\r\nthe middle of the 19th century the Upper Engadine came into fashion as a\r\ngreat \"air-cure,\" and now Maloja, Sils, Silvaplana, Campfer and St\r\nMoritz are all well known; those who desire to explore the glaciers of\r\nthe Bernina group mostly resort to Pontresina, on the Flatzbach, the\r\nstream descending from the Bernina Pass. Yet, owing to its great\r\nelevation, the scenery of the Upper Engadine has a bleak, northern\r\naspect. Pines and larches alone flourish, garden vegetables are grown\r\nonly in sunny spots, and there is no tillage. The Alpine flora is very\r\nrich and varied. But snow falls even in August, and the climate is well\r\ndescribed in the proverb, \"nine months winter, and three months cold\r\nweather.\" The villages are built entirely of stone (as also in the Lower\r\nEngadine), chiefly to guard against destructive fires that were formerly\r\nfrequent in this narrow, wind-swept valley. The wealth of the\r\ninhabitants consists in their hay meadows and pastures. The lower\r\npastures support large herds of cows, while the higher are let out (in\r\nboth parts of the valley) to Bergamasque shepherds, who come thither\r\nevery summer with their flocks. In the Lower Engadine the chief\r\nattraction is formed by the mineral springs at Schuls below Tarasp,\r\nwhich are much frequented during the summer. The wild gorge of\r\nFinstermunz separates the last Swiss village, Martinsbruck, from the\r\nfirst Tirolese village, Pfunds, the gorge being passable only on foot,\r\nwhile the carriage road makes a great detour by way of Nauders, so that\r\nthe two villages named are 13 m. by road from each other. The earliest\r\nfull description of the country by an English traveller is that by\r\nArchdeacon W. Coxe, in _Travels in Switzerland_ (London, 1789).\r\n\r\nThe Upper Engadine is not mentioned in authentic documents till 1139,\r\nthe bishop of Coire being then the great lord, and, from the 13th\r\ncentury, having as his bailiffs the family of Planta, the original seat\r\nof which was at Zuz. The valley obtained its freedom from both in 1486\r\n(Planta) and in 1526, when the temporal powers of the bishop were\r\nabolished. In 1367 it (as well as the bishop's vassals in the Lower\r\nEngadine) joined the newly founded League of God's House or\r\n_Gotteshausbund_ (see GRISONS), one of the 3 Raetian Leagues, which\r\nlasted till 1799-1801, when the whole Engadine became part of Canton\r\nRaetia of the Helvetic Republic, which, in 1803, altered its name to\r\nthat of Grisons or Graubunden, and then first entered the Swiss\r\nConfederation. In the Upper Engadine the \"Referendum\" existed as between\r\nthe different villages composing a bailiwick (_Hochgericht_). The\r\nhistory of the Lower Engadine is for long quite different. Though always\r\ncomprised in the diocese of Coire, it formed from the early 9th century\r\nonwards (with the Vintschgau) a separate county, which was gradually\r\nabsorbed in that which, later, took the name of the county of Tirol. The\r\nlimit between the Upper Engadine and the Tirolese Lower Engadine was\r\ndefinitively fixed in 1282 at the Punt' Ota (the high bridge) just above\r\nBrail, and mentioned in 1139 already. In 1363 Tirol came into the\r\npossession of the Habsburgers, who were troublesome neighbours both to\r\nthe Upper Engadine and to the League of God's House. Their power was\r\nstemmed in 1499 at the battle of the Calven gorge (above Mals), though\r\nit was only in 1652 that the Lower Engadine bought up the remaining\r\nrights of the Habsburgers. But the castle of Tarasp (acquired by them in\r\n1464) was excepted: the lordship was given by them in 1687 to the\r\nDietrichstein family, and held by it till 1801, when Austria ceded it to\r\nFrance, which, in 1803, handed it over to the Swiss Confederation, by\r\nwhich it was incorporated in 1809 with the Canton of the Grisons. This\r\nlong connexion with Tirol accounts for the fact that Tarasp is still\r\nmainly Romanist, while the lonely Swiss valley of Samnaun (above\r\nMartinsbruck) has given up its Protestantism and its Ladin speech owing\r\nto communications with Tirol being easier than with Switzerland. The\r\nbears in the bear pit at Bern come from the forests in the lower Spol\r\nvalley, above Zernez, in the Lower Engadine, on the way to the Ofen\r\nPass. The upper Spol valley (Livigno) is Italian (see VALTELLINA).\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--M. Caviezel, _Das Oberengadin_, 7th edition (Coire,\r\n  1896); C.

C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGAGED COLUMN, in architecture, a form of column, sometimes defined as\r\nsemi or three-quarter detached according to its projection; the term\r\nimplies that the column is partly attached to a pier or wall. It is\r\nrarely found in Greek work, and then only in exceptional cases, but it\r\nexists in profusion in Roman architecture. In the temples it is attached\r\nto the cella walls. repeating the columns of the peristyle, and in the\r\ntheatres and amphitheatres, where they subdivided the arched openings:\r\nin all these cases engaged columns are utilized as a decorative feature,\r\nand as a rule the same proportions are maintained as if they had been\r\nisolated columns. In Romanesque work the classic proportions are no\r\nlonger adhered to; the engaged column, attached to the piers, has always\r\na special function to perform, either to support subsidiary arches, or,\r\nraised to the vault, to carry its transverse or diagonal ribs. The same\r\nconstructional object is followed in the earlier Gothic styles, in which\r\nthey become merged into the mouldings. Being virtually always ready\r\nmade, so far as their design is concerned, they were much affected by\r\nthe Italian revivalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGEL, ERNST (1821-1896), German political economist and statistician,\r\nwas born in Dresden on the 21st of March 1821. He studied at the famous\r\nmining academy of Freiberg, in Saxony, and on completing his curriculum\r\ntravelled in Germany and France. Immediately after the revolution of\r\n1848 he was attached to the royal commission in Saxony appointed to\r\ndetermine the relations between trade and labour. In 1850 he was\r\ndirected by the government to assist in the organization of the German\r\nIndustrial Exhibition of Leipzig (the first of its kind). The success\r\nwhich crowned his efforts was so great that in 1854 he was induced to\r\nenter the government service, as chief of the newly instituted\r\nstatistical department. He retired, however, from the office in 1858. He\r\nfounded at Dresden the first Mortgage Insurance Society\r\n(Hypotheken-Versicherungsgesellschaft), and as a result of the success\r\nof his work was summoned in 1860 to Berlin as director of the\r\nstatistical department, in succession to Karl Friedrich Wilhelm\r\nDieterici (1790-1859). In his new office he made himself a name of\r\nworld-wide reputation. Raised to the rank of _Geheimer Regierungsrat_,\r\nhe retired in 1882 and lived henceforward in Radebeul near Dresden,\r\nwhere he died on the 8th of December 1896. Engel was a voluminous writer\r\non the subjects with which his name is connected, but his statistical\r\npapers are mostly published in the periodicals which he himself\r\nestablished, viz. _Preuss. Statistik_ (in 1861); _Zeitschrift des\r\nStatistischen Bureaus_, and _Zeitschrift des Statistischen Bureaus des\r\nKonigreichs Sachsen_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGEL, JOHANN JAKOB (1741-1802), German author, was born at Parchim, in\r\nMecklenburg, on the 11th of September 1741. He studied theology at\r\nRostock and Butzow, and philosophy at Leipzig, where he took his\r\ndoctor's degree. In 1776 he was appointed professor of moral philosophy\r\nand belles-lettres in the Joachimstal gymnasium at Berlin, and a few\r\nyears later he became tutor to the crown prince of Prussia, afterwards\r\nFrederick William III. The lessons which he gave his royal pupil in\r\nethics and politics were published in 1798 under the title\r\n_Furstenspiegel_, and are a favourable specimen of his powers as a\r\npopular philosophical writer. In 1787 he was admitted a member of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences of Berlin, and in the same year he became director\r\nof the royal theatre, an office he resigned in 1794. He died on the 28th\r\nof June 1802.\r\n\r\nBesides numerous dramas, some of which had a considerable success, Engel\r\nwrote several valuable books on aesthetic subjects. His _Anfangsgrunde\r\neiner Theorie der Dichtungsarten_ (1783) showed fine taste and acute\r\ncritical faculty if it lacked imagination and poetic insight. The same\r\nexcellences and the same defects were apparent in his _Ideen zu einer\r\nMimik_ (1785), written in the form of letters. His most popular work was\r\n_Der Philosoph fur die Welt_ (1775), which consists chiefly of dialogues\r\non men and morals, written from the utilitarian standpoint of the\r\nphilosophy of the day. His last work, a romance entitled _Herr Lorenz\r\nStark_ (1795), achieved a great success, by virtue of the marked\r\nindividuality of its characters and its appeal to middle-class\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\n  Engel's _Samtliche Schriften_ were published in 12 volumes at Berlin\r\n  in 1801-1806; a new edition appeared at Frankfort in 1851. See K.\r\n  Schroder, _Johann Jakob Engel_ (Vortrag) (1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGELBERG, an Alpine village and valley in central Switzerland, much\r\nfrequented by visitors in summer and to some extent in winter. It is 14\r\nm. by electric railway from Stansstad, on the Lake of Lucerne, past\r\nStans. The village (3343 ft.) is in a mountain basin, shut in on all\r\nsides by lofty mountains (the highest is the Titlis, 10,627 ft. in the\r\nsouth-east), so that it is often hot in summer. It communicates by the\r\nSurenen Pass (7563 ft.) with Wassen, on the St Gotthard railway, and by\r\nthe Joch Pass (7267 ft.) past the favourite summer resort of the\r\nEngstlen Alp (6034 ft.), with Meiringen in the Bernese Oberland. The\r\nvillage has clustered round the great Benedictine monastery which gives\r\nits name to the valley, from the legend that its site was fixed by\r\nangels, so that the spot was named \"Mons Angelorum.\" The monastery was\r\nfounded about 1120 and still survives, though the buildings date only\r\nfrom the early 18th century. Its library suffered much at the hands of\r\nthe French in 1798. From 1462 onwards it was under the protectorate of\r\nLucerne, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Uri. In 1798 the abbot lost all his\r\ntemporal powers, and his domains were annexed to the Obwalden division\r\nof Unterwalden, but in 1803 were transferred to the Nidwalden division.\r\nHowever, in 1816, in consequence of the desperate resistance made by the\r\nNidwalden men to the new Federal Pact of 1815, they were punished by the\r\nfresh transfer of the valley to Obwalden, part of which it still forms.\r\nAs the pastures forming the upper portion of the Engelberg valley have\r\nfor ages belonged to Uri, the actual valley itself is politically\r\nisolated between Uri and Nidwalden. The monastery is still directly\r\ndependent on the pope. In 1900 the valley had 1973 inhabitants,\r\npractically all German-speaking and Romanists.     (W. A. B. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGELBRECHTSDATTER, DORTHE (1634-1716), Norwegian poet, was born at\r\nBergen on the 16th of January 1634; her father, Engelbrecht Jorgensen,\r\nwas originally rector of the high school in that city, and afterwards\r\ndean of the cathedral. In 1652 she married Ambrosius Hardenbech, a\r\ntheological writer famous for his flowery funeral sermons, who succeeded\r\nher father at the cathedral in 1659. They had five sons and four\r\ndaughters. In 1678 her first volume appeared, _Sjaelens aandelige\r\nSangoffer_ (\"The Soul's Spiritual Offering of Song\") published at\r\nCopenhagen. This volume of hymns and devotional pieces, very modestly\r\nbrought out, had an unparalleled success. The fortunate poetess was\r\ninvited to Denmark, and on her arrival at Copenhagen was presented at\r\nCourt. She was also introduced to Thomas Kingo, the father of Danish\r\npoetry, and the two greeted one another with improvised couplets, which\r\nhave been preserved, and of which the poetess's reply is incomparably\r\nthe neater. In 1683 her husband died, and before 1698 she had buried all\r\nher nine children. In the midst of her troubles appeared her second\r\nwork, the _Taareoffer_ (\"Sacrifice of Tears\"), which is a continuous\r\nreligious poem in four books. This was combined with the Sangoffer, and\r\nno fewer than three editions of the united works were published before\r\nher death, and many after it. In 1698 she brought out a third volume of\r\nsacred verse, _Et kristeligt Valet fra Verden_ (\"A Christian Farewell to\r\nthe World\"), a very tame production. She died on the 19th of February\r\n1716. The first verses of Dorthe Engelbrechtsdatter are the best; her\r\n_Sangoffer_ was dedicated to Jesus, the Taareoffer to Queen Charlotte\r\nAmalia; this is significant of her changed position in the eyes of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGELHARDT, JOHANN GEORG VEIT (1791-1855), German theologian, was born\r\nat Neustadt-on-the-Aisch on the 12th of November 1791, and was educated\r\nat Erlangen, where he afterwards taught in the gymnasium (1817), and\r\nbecame professor of theology in the university (1821). His two great\r\nworks were a _Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte_ in 4 vols. (1833-1834),\r\nand a _Dogmengeschichte_ in 2 vols. (1839). He died at Erlangen on the\r\n13th of September 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGHIEN, LOUIS ANTOINE HENRI DE BOURBON CONDE, DUC D' (1772-1804), was\r\nthe only son of Henri Louis Joseph, prince of Conde, and of Louise Marie\r\nTherese Mathilde, sister of the duke of Orleans (Philippe Egalite), and\r\nwas born at Chantilly on the 2nd of August 1772. He was educated\r\nprivately by the abbe Millot, and received a military training from the\r\ncommodore de Virieux. He early showed the warlike spirit of the house of\r\nConde, and began his military career in 1788. On the outbreak of the\r\nFrench Revolution he \"emigrated\" with very many of the nobles a few days\r\nafter the fall of the Bastille, and remained in exile, seeking to raise\r\nforces for the invasion of France and the restoration of the old\r\nmonarchy. In 1792, on the outbreak of war, he held a command in the\r\nforce of _emigres_ (styled the \"French royal army\") which shared in the\r\nduke of Brunswick's unsuccessful invasion of France. He continued to\r\nserve under his father and grandfather in what was known as the Conde\r\narmy, and on several occasions distinguished himself by his bravery and\r\nardour in the vanguard. On the dissolution of that force after the peace\r\nof Luneville (February 1801) he married privately the princess\r\nCharlotte, niece of Cardinal de Rohan, and took up his residence at\r\nEttenheim in Baden, near the Rhine. Early in the year 1804 Napoleon,\r\nthen First Consul of France, heard news which seemed to connect the\r\nyoung duke with the Cadoudal-Pichegru conspiracy then being tracked by\r\nthe French police. The news ran that the duke was in company with\r\nDumouriez and made secret journeys into France. This was false; the\r\nacquaintance was Thumery, a harmless old man, and the duke had no\r\ndealings with Cadoudal or Pichegru. Napoleon gave orders for the seizure\r\nof the duke. French mounted gendarmes crossed the Rhine secretly,\r\nsurrounded his house and brought him to Strassburg (15th of March 1804),\r\nand thence to the castle of Vincennes, near Paris. There a commission of\r\nFrench colonels was hastily gathered to try him. Meanwhile Napoleon had\r\nfound out the true facts of the case, and the ground of the accusation\r\nwas hastily changed. The duke was now charged chiefly with bearing arms\r\nagainst France in the late war, and with intending to take part in the\r\nnew coalition then proposed against France. The colonels hastily and\r\nmost informally drew up the act of condemnation, being incited thereto\r\nby orders from Savary (q.v.), who had come charged with instructions.\r\nSavary intervened to prevent all chance of an interview between the\r\ncondemned and the First Consul; and the duke was shot in the moat of the\r\ncastle, near a grave which had already been prepared. With him ended the\r\nhouse of Conde. In 1816 the bones were exhumed and placed in the chapel\r\nof the castle. It is now known that Josephine and Mme de Remusat had\r\nbegged Napoleon for mercy towards the duke; but nothing would bend his\r\nwill. The blame which the apologists of the emperor have thrown on\r\nTalleyrand or Savary is undeserved. On his way to St Helena and at\r\nLongwood he asserted that, in the same circumstances, he would do the\r\nsame again; he inserted a similar declaration in his will.\r\n\r\n  See H. Welschinger, _Le Due d'Enghien 1772-1804_ (Paris, 1888); A.\r\n  Nougaret de Fayet, _Recherches historiques sur le proces et la\r\n  condamnation du duc d'Enghien_, 2 vols. (Paris, 1844); Comte A.

Barriere, also the edition of\r\n  the duke's letters, &c., by Count Boulay de la Meurthe (tome i.,\r\n  Paris, 1904; tome ii., 1908).     (J. Hl. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGHIEN, a town in the province of Hainaut, Belgium, lying south of\r\nGrammont. Pop. (1904) 4541. It is the centre of considerable lace, linen\r\nand cotton industries. There is a fine park outside the town belonging\r\nto the duke of Arenberg, whose ancestor, Charles de Ligne, bought it\r\nfrom Henry IV. in 1607, but the chateau in which the duke of Arenberg of\r\nthe 18th century entertained Voltaire no longer exists. Curiously enough\r\nthe cottage, a stone building, built by the same duke for Jean Jacques\r\nRousseau, still stands in the park, while the ducal residence was burnt\r\ndown by the _sans-culottes_. A fine pavilion or kiosk, named de\r\nl'Etoile, has also survived. The great Conde was given, for a victory\r\ngained near this place, the right to use the style of Enghien among his\r\nsubsidiary titles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINE (Lat. _ingenium_), a term which in the time of Chaucer had the\r\nmeaning of \"natural talent\" or \"ability,\" corresponding to the Latin\r\nfrom which it is derived (cf. \"A man hath sapiences thre, Memorie,\r\nengin, and intellect also,\" _Second Nun's Tale_, 339); in this sense it\r\nis now obsolete. It also denoted a mechanical tool or contrivance, and\r\nespecially a weapon of war; this use may be compared with that of\r\n_ingenium_ in classical Latin to mean a clever idea or device, and in\r\nlater Latin, as in Tertullian, for a warlike instrument or machine. In\r\nthe 19th century it came to have, when employed alone, a specific\r\nreference to the steam-engine (q.v.), but it is also used of other prime\r\nmovers such as the air-engine, gas-engine and oil-engine (qq.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINEERING, a term for the action of the verb \"to engineer,\" which in\r\nits early uses referred specially to the operations of those who\r\nconstructed engines of war and executed works intended to serve military\r\npurposes. Such military engineers were long the only ones to whom the\r\ntitle was applied. But about the middle of the 18th century there began\r\nto arise a new class of engineers who concerned themselves with works\r\nwhich, though they might be in some cases, as in the making of roads, of\r\nthe same character as those undertaken by military engineers, were\r\nneither exclusively military in purpose nor executed by soldiers, and\r\nthose men by way of distinction came to be known as civil engineers. No\r\nbetter definition of their aims and functions can be given than that\r\nwhich is contained in the charter (dated 1828) of the Institution of\r\nCivil Engineers (London), where civil engineering is described as the\r\n\"art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use and\r\nconvenience of man, as the means of production and of traffic in states,\r\nboth for external and internal trade, as applied in the construction of\r\nroads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation and docks for\r\ninternal intercourse and exchange, and in the construction of ports,\r\nharbours, moles, breakwaters and lighthouses, and in the art of\r\nnavigation by artificial power for the purposes of commerce, and in the\r\nconstruction and adaptation of machinery, and in the drainage of cities\r\nand towns.\" Wide as is this enumeration, the practice of a civil\r\nengineer in the earlier part of the 19th century might cover many or\r\neven most of the subjects it contains. But gradually specialization set\r\nin. Perhaps the first branch to be recognized as separate was\r\n_mechanical_ engineering, which is concerned with steam-engines, machine\r\ntools, mill-work and moving machinery in general, and it was soon\r\nfollowed by _mining_ engineering, which deals with the location and\r\nworking of coal, ore and other minerals. Subsequently numerous other\r\nmore or less strictly defined groups and subdivisions came into\r\nexistence, such as _naval architecture_ dealing with the design of\r\nships, _marine_ engineering with the engines for propelling steamers,\r\n_sanitary_ engineering with water-supply and disposal of sewage and\r\nother refuse, _gas_ engineering with the manufacture and distribution of\r\nilluminating gas, and chemical engineering with the design and erection\r\nof the plant required for the manufacture of such chemical products as\r\nalkali, acids and dyes, and for the working of a wide range of\r\nindustrial processes. The last great new branch is _electrical_\r\nengineering, which touches on the older branches at so many points that\r\nit has been said that all engineers must be electricians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINEERS, MILITARY. From the earliest times engineers have been\r\nemployed both in the field of war and on field defences. In modern\r\ntimes, however, the application of numerous scientific and engineering\r\ndevices to warfare has resulted in the creation of many minor branches\r\nof military engineering, some of them almost rivalling in importance\r\ntheir primary duty of fortification and siegecraft, such as the field\r\ntelegraph, the balloon service, nearly all demolitions, the building of\r\npontoon and other bridges, and the construction and working of military\r\nroads, railways, piers, &c. All these branches requiring special\r\nknowledge, the modern tendency is to divide a corps of engineers in\r\naccordance with such requirements. The \"field companies\" and \"fortress\r\ncompanies\" of the R.E. represent the traditional tactical application of\r\ntheir arm to works of offence and defence in field and siege warfare.\r\nThe balloon, telegraph, and other branches, also organized on a\r\npermanent footing, represent the modern application of scientific aids\r\nin warfare. (See FORTIFICATION AND SIEGECRAFT; TACTICS; INFANTRY, &c.)\r\n\r\n_History._--It is difficult to distinguish between military and civil\r\nengineers in the earlier ages of modern history, for all engineers acted\r\nas builders of castles and defensible strongholds, as well as\r\nmanufacturers and directors of engines of war with which to attack or\r\ndefend them. The annals of fortification show professors, artists, &c.,\r\nas well as soldiers and architects, as designers and builders of\r\ninnumerable systems of fortification. By the middle of the 13th century\r\nthere was in England an organized body of skilled workmen employed under\r\na \"chief engineer.\" At the siege of Calais in 1347 this corps consisted\r\nof masons, carpenters, smiths, tentmakers, miners, armourers, gunners\r\nand artillerymen. At the siege of Harfleur in 1415 the chief engineer\r\nwas designated Master of the King's Works, Guns and Ordnance, and the\r\ncorps under him numbered 500 men, including 21 foot-archers.\r\nHeadquarters of engineers existed at the Tower of London before 1350,\r\nand a century later developed into the Office of Ordnance (afterwards\r\nthe Board of Ordnance), whose duty was to administer all matters\r\nconnected with fortifications, artillery and ordnance stores.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. employed many engineers (of whom Sir Richard Lee is the best\r\nknown) in constructing coast defences from Penzance to the Thames and\r\nthence to Berwick-on-Tweed, and in strengthening the fortresses of\r\nCalais and Guines in France. He also added to the organization a body of\r\npioneers under trench-masters and a master trenchmaster. Charles II.\r\nincreased the peace establishment of engineers and formed a separate one\r\nfor Ireland, with a chief engineer who was also surveyor-general of the\r\nKing's Works. In both countries only a small permanent establishment was\r\nmaintained, a special ordnance train being enrolled in war-time for each\r\nexpedition and disbanded on its termination. The commander of an\r\nordnance train was frequently, but not necessarily, an engineer, but\r\nthere was always a chief engineer of each train. At Blenheim (1704)\r\nMarlborough's ordnance train was commanded by Holcroft Blood, a\r\ndistinguished engineer. But after the rebellion of 1715 it was decided\r\nto separate the artillery from the engineers, and the royal warrant of\r\n26th May 1716 established two companies of artillery as a separate\r\nregiment, and an engineer corps composed of 1 chief engineer, 3\r\ndirectors, 6 engineers-in-ordinary, 6 engineers extraordinary, 6\r\nsub-engineers and 6 practitioner engineers.\r\n\r\nUntil the 14th of May 1757 officers of engineers frequently held, in\r\naddition to their military rank in the corps of engineers, commissions\r\nin foot regiments; but on and after that date all engineer officers were\r\ngazetted to army as well as engineer rank--the chief engineer as colonel\r\nof foot, directors as lieutenant-colonel, and so forth down to\r\npractitioners as ensigns. On the 18th of November 1782 engineer grades,\r\nexcept that of chief engineer, were abolished, and the establishment was\r\nfixed at 1 chief engineer and colonel, 6 colonels commandant, 6\r\nlieutenant-colonels, 9 captains, 9 captain lieutenants (afterwards\r\nsecond captains), 22 first lieutenants, and 22 second lieutenants. Ten\r\nyears later a small invalid corps was formed. In 1787 the designation\r\n\"Royal\" was conferred upon the engineers, and its precedence settled to\r\nbe on the right of the army, with the royal artillery.\r\n\r\nIn 1802 the title of chief engineer was changed to inspector-general of\r\nfortifications. From this time to the conclusion of the Crimean War\r\nvarious augmentations took place, consequent on the increasing and\r\nwidely extending duties thrown upon the officers. These, in addition to\r\nordinary military duties, comprised the construction and maintenance of\r\nfortifications, barrack and ordnance store buildings, and all\r\nengineering services connected with them. The cadastral survey of the\r\nUnited Kingdom (called the \"Ordnance Survey\") had been entrusted to the\r\nengineers as far back as 1784, and absorbed many officers in its\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nIn 1772 the formation at Gibraltar of \"The Company of Soldier\r\nArtificers,\" officered by Royal Engineers, was authorized, and a second\r\ncompany was added soon afterwards. In 1787 by royal warrant \"The Corps\r\nof Royal Military Artificers\" was established at home, consisting of six\r\ncompanies, with which the Gibraltar companies were amalgamated. In 1806\r\nthis corps was doubled, and in 1811 increased to 32 companies. In 1813\r\nits title was changed to \"The Royal Sappers and Miners.\" In 1856, at the\r\nclose of the Crimean War, it was incorporated with \"The Corps of Royal\r\nEngineers,\" by whom it had always been officered. At that date the corps\r\nnumbered about 340 officers and 4000 non-commissioned officers and men,\r\nin 1 troop and 32 companies.\r\n\r\nIn 1770 the East India Company reorganized the engineer corps of the\r\nthree presidencies, composed of officers only. Native corps of sappers\r\nor pioneers were formed later, and officered principally by engineers.\r\nThe officers of engineers were employed in peacetime on the public works\r\nof the country, their services when required being placed at the\r\ndisposal of the military authorities. The Indian Engineers have not only\r\ndistinguished themselves in the operations of war, but have left\r\nmonuments of engineering skill in the irrigation works, railways,\r\nsurveys, roads, bridges, public buildings and defences of the country.\r\nWhen Indian administration was transferred to the crown (1862) the\r\nIndian Engineers became \"Royal,\" so that there now exists but one corps,\r\nthe Royal Engineers. This is composed of about 1000 officers and 7700\r\nwarrant and non-commissioned officers and men. Of the officers some 220\r\nare attached to units, about 400 employed either at home or in the\r\ncolonies on engineering duties in military commands, on the staff, or on\r\nspecial duty, and about 370 on the Indian establishment. The supreme\r\ntechnical control of the Royal Engineers is exercised from the War\r\nOffice. See also UNITED KINGDOM; ARMY.\r\n\r\nThe history of the French engineers shows a somewhat similar line of\r\ndevelopment. Originally selected officers of infantry were given brevets\r\nas engineers, and these men performed military and also civil duties for\r\nthe king's service by the aid of companies of workmen enlisted and\r\ndischarged from time to time. Vauban (q.v.) was the founder of the\r\nfamous _corps de Genie_ (1690). Its members were selected officers and\r\ncivilians, employed in all branches of military and naval services, and\r\nit soon achieved its European reputation as the first school of\r\nfortification and siegecraft. It received a special uniform in 1732.\r\nAbout 1755 it was for a time merged in the artillery. In 1766 the title\r\nof _Genie_ was conferred upon the officers, and the same name (_troupes\r\nde Genie_) was given to the previously existing companies of sappers and\r\nminers in 1801.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the separate Corps of Engineers (since 1794 there\r\nhad been a Corps of Artillerists and Engineers) was organized in 1802,\r\nstarting with a small body stationed at West Point, which in 1838 and\r\n1846 was gradually increased, and in 1861 given three additional\r\ncompanies. In 1866 they were formed into a battalion and stationed at\r\nWillets Point, N.Y. In 1901 they were reorganized in three battalions,\r\nwith a total strength of 1282. The U.S. Engineer School, formerly at\r\nWillets Point, was transferred in 1901 to Washington. Until 1866 the\r\nmilitary academy at West Point was under the supervision of the Corps of\r\nEngineers, but from that time its direction was thrown open; but the\r\nhighest branch at West Point is still regarded as that of the engineers.\r\nThe Corps of Engineers has done a great deal of highly important work in\r\nthe United States, notably in building forts, and improving rivers and\r\nharbours for navigation.\r\n\r\n  See Maj.-Gen. R.W. Porter, _Hist, of the Corps of Royal Engineers_\r\n  (Chatham, 1889); C. Lecomte, _Les Ingenieurs militaires de la France_\r\n  (Paris, 1903); H. Frobenius, _Geschichte der K. preuss. Ingenieur- und\r\n  Pioneer-Korps_ (Berlin, 1906).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGIS, a cave on the banks of the Meuse near Liege, Belgium, where in\r\n1832 Dr P.C. Schmerling found human remains in deposits belonging to the\r\nQuaternary period. Bones of the cave-bear, mammoth, rhinoceros and hyena\r\nwere discovered in association with parts of a man's skeleton and a\r\nhuman skull. This, known as \"the Engis Skull,\" gave rise to much\r\ndiscussion among anthropologists, since it has characteristics of both\r\nhigh and low development, the forehead, low and narrow, indicating\r\nslight intelligence, while the abnormally large brain cavity contradicts\r\nthis conclusion. Of it Huxley wrote: \"There is no mark of degradation\r\nabout any part of its structure. It is a fair average human skull, which\r\nmight have belonged to a philosopher, or might have contained the\r\nthoughtless brains of a savage.\" Dr Schmerling concluded that the human\r\nremains were those of man who had been contemporary with the extinct\r\nmammals. As, however, fragments of coarse pottery were found in the cave\r\nwhich bore other evidence of having been used by neolithic man, by whom\r\nthe cave-floor and its contents might have been disturbed and mixed, his\r\narguments have not been regarded as conclusive. There is, however, no\r\ndoubt as to the great age of the Engis Skull. Discoveries of a like\r\nnature were made by Dr Schmerling in the neighbourhood in the caves of\r\nEngihoul, Chokier and others.\r\n\r\n  See P.C.
