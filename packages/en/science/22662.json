The cobwebs are more authentic\r\nthan the gimp laces, and the old pear-tree furniture on exhibition is\r\nactually younger than the mahogany which arrived but yesterday from\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe warehouse of my bric-à-brac dealer was a veritable Capharnaum. All\r\nages and all nations seemed to have made their rendezvous there. An\r\nEtruscan lamp of red clay stood upon a Boule cabinet, with ebony panels,\r\nbrightly striped by lines of inlaid brass; a duchess of the court of\r\nLouis xv. nonchalantly extended her fawn-like feet under a massive\r\ntable of the time of Louis xiii., with heavy spiral supports of oak, and\r\ncarven designs of chimeras and foliage intermingled.\r\n\r\nUpon the denticulated shelves of several sideboards glittered immense\r\nJapanese dishes with red and blue designs relieved by gilded hatching,\r\nside by side with enamelled works by Bernard Palissy, representing\r\nserpents, frogs, and lizards in relief.\r\n\r\nFrom disembowelled cabinets escaped cascades of silver-lustrous Chinese\r\nsilks and waves of tinsel, which an oblique sunbeam shot through with\r\nluminous beads, while portraits of every era, in frames more or less\r\ntarnished, smiled through their yellow varnish.\r\n\r\nThe striped breastplate of a damascened suit of Milanese armour\r\nglittered in one corner; loves and nymphs of porcelain, Chinese\r\ngrotesques, vases of _céladon_ and crackleware, Saxon and old Sèvres\r\ncups encumbered the shelves and nooks of the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe dealer followed me closely through the tortuous way contrived\r\nbetween the piles of furniture, warding off with his hand the hazardous\r\nsweep of my coat-skirts, watching my elbows with the uneasy attention of\r\nan antiquarian and a usurer.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular face, that of the merchant; an immense skull, polished\r\nlike a knee, and surrounded by a thin aureole of white hair, which\r\nbrought out the clear salmon tint of his complexion all the more\r\nstrikingly, lent him a false aspect of patriarchal _bonhomie_,\r\ncounteracted, however, by the scintillation of two little yellow eyes\r\nwhich trembled in their orbits like two louis-d'or upon quicksilver. The\r\ncurve of his nose presented an aquiline silhouette, which suggested the\r\nOriental or Jewish type. His hands--thin, slender, full of nerves which\r\nprojected like strings upon the finger-board of a violin, and armed with\r\nclaws like those on the terminations of bats' wings--shook with senile\r\ntrembling; but those convulsively agitated hands became firmer\r\nthan steel pincers or lobsters' claws when they lifted any precious\r\narticle--an onyx cup, a Venetian glass, or a dish of Bohemian crystal.\r\nThis strange old man had an aspect so thoroughly rabbinical and\r\ncabalistic that he would have been burnt on the mere testimony of his\r\nface three centuries ago.\r\n\r\n'Will you not buy something from me to-day, sir? Here is a Malay kreese\r\nwith a blade undulating like flame. Look at those grooves contrived for\r\nthe blood to run along, those teeth set backward so as to tear out the\r\nentrails in withdrawing the weapon. It is a fine character of ferocious\r\narm, and will look well in your collection. This two-handed sword\r\nis very beautiful. It is the work of Josepe de la Hera; and this\r\n_colichemarde_ with its fenestrated guard--what a superb specimen of\r\nhandicraft!'\r\n\r\n'No; I have quite enough weapons and instruments of carnage. I want a\r\nsmall figure,--something which will suit me as a paper-weight, for I\r\ncannot endure those trumpery bronzes which the stationers sell, and\r\nwhich may be found on everybody's desk.'\r\n\r\nThe old gnome foraged among his ancient wares, and finally arranged\r\nbefore me some antique bronzes, so-called at least; fragments of\r\nmalachite, little Hindoo or Chinese idols, a kind of poussah-toys in\r\njade-stone, representing the incarnations of Brahma or Vishnoo, and\r\nwonderfully appropriate to the very undivine office of holding papers\r\nand letters in place.\r\n\r\nI was hesitating between a porcelain dragon, all constellated with\r\nwarts, its mouth formidable with bristling tusks and ranges of\r\nteeth, and an abominable little Mexican fetich, representing the god\r\nVitziliputzili _au naturel_, when I caught sight of a charming foot,\r\nwhich I at first took for a fragment of some antique Venus.\r\n\r\nIt had those beautiful ruddy and tawny tints that lend to Florentine\r\nbronze that warm living look so much preferable to the gray-green aspect\r\nof common bronzes, which might easily be mistaken for statues in a state\r\nof putrefaction. Satiny gleams played over its rounded forms, doubtless\r\npolished by the amorous kisses of twenty centuries, for it seemed a\r\nCorinthian bronze, a work of the best era of art, perhaps moulded by\r\nLysippus himself.\r\n\r\n'That foot will be my choice,' said to the merchant, who regarded me\r\nwith an ironical and saturnine air, and held out the object desired that\r\nI might examine it more fully.\r\n\r\nI was surprised at its lightness. It was not a foot of metal, but in\r\nsooth a foot of flesh, an embalmed foot, a mummy's foot. On examining\r\nit still more closely the very grain of the skin, and the almost\r\nimperceptible lines impressed upon it by the texture of the bandages,\r\nbecame perceptible. The toes were slender and delicate, and terminated\r\nby perfectly formed nails, pure and transparent as agates. The great\r\ntoe, slightly separated from the rest, afforded a happy contrast, in the\r\nantique style, to the position of the other toes, and lent it an aerial\r\nlightness--the grace of a bird's foot. The sole, scarcely streaked by\r\na few almost imperceptible cross lines, afforded evidence that it had\r\nnever touched the bare ground, and had only come in contact with the\r\nfinest matting of Nile rushes and the softest carpets of panther skin.\r\n\r\n'Ha, ha, you want the foot of the Princess Hermonthis!' exclaimed the\r\nmerchant, with a strange giggle, fixing his owlish eyes upon me. 'Ha,\r\nha, ha! For a paper-weight! An original idea!--artistic idea!-Old\r\nPharaoh would certainly have been surprised had some one told him that\r\nthe foot of his adored daughter would be used for a paper-weight after\r\nhe had had a mountain of granite hollowed out as a receptacle for\r\nthe triple coffin, painted and gilded, covered with hieroglyphics and\r\nbeautiful paintings of the Judgment of Souls,' continued the queer\r\nlittle merchant, half audibly, as though talking to himself.\r\n\r\n'How much will you charge me for this mummy fragment?'\r\n\r\n'Ah, the highest price I can get, for it is a superb piece. If I had the\r\nmatch of it you could not have it for less than five hundred francs. The\r\ndaughter of a Pharaoh! Nothing is more rare.'\r\n\r\n'Assuredly that is not a common article, but still, how much do you\r\nwant? In the first place let me warn you that all my wealth consists of\r\njust five louis. I can buy anything that costs five louis, but nothing\r\ndearer. You might search my vest pockets and most secret drawers without\r\neven finding one poor five-franc piece more.'\r\n\r\n'Five louis for the foot of the Princess Hermonthis! That is very\r\nlittle, very little indeed. 'Tis an authentic foot,' muttered the\r\nmerchant, shaking his head, and imparting a peculiar rotary motion to\r\nhis eyes. 'Well, take it, and I will give you the bandages into the\r\nbargain,' he added, wrapping the foot in an ancient damask rag. 'Very\r\nfine? Real damask--Indian damask which has never been redyed. It is\r\nstrong, and yet it is soft,' he mumbled, stroking the frayed tissue with\r\nhis fingers, through the trade-acquired habit which moved him to praise\r\neven an object of such little value that he himself deemed it only worth\r\nthe giving away.\r\n\r\nHe poured the gold coins into a sort of mediaeval alms-purse hanging at\r\nhis belt, repeating:\r\n\r\n'The foot of the Princess Hermonthis to be used for a paper-weight!'\r\n\r\nThen turning his phosphorescent eyes upon me, he exclaimed in a voice\r\nstrident as the crying of a cat which has swallowed a fish-bone:\r\n\r\n'Old Pharaoh will not be well pleased. He loved his daughter, the dear\r\nman!'\r\n\r\n'You speak as if you were a contemporary of his. You are old enough,\r\ngoodness knows! but you do not date back to the Pyramids of Egypt,' I\r\nanswered, laughingly, from the threshold.\r\n\r\nI went home, delighted with my acquisition.\r\n\r\nWith the idea of putting it to profitable use as soon as possible, I\r\nplaced the foot of the divine Princess Hermonthis upon a heap of papers\r\nscribbled over with verses, in themselves an undecipherable mosaic work\r\nof erasures; articles freshly begun; letters forgotten, and posted\r\nin the table drawer instead of the letter-box, an error to which\r\nabsent-minded people are peculiarly liable. The effect was charming,\r\n_bizarre_, and romantic.\r\n\r\nWell satisfied with this embellishment, I went out with the gravity and\r\npride becoming one who feels that he has the ineffable advantage over\r\nall the passers-by whom he elbows, of possessing a piece of the Princess\r\nHermonthis, daughter of Pharaoh.\r\n\r\nI looked upon all who did not possess, like myself, a paper-weight so\r\nauthentically Egyptian as very ridiculous people, and it seemed to me\r\nthat the proper occupation of every sensible man should consist in the\r\nmere fact of having a mummy's foot upon his desk.\r\n\r\nHappily I met some friends, whose presence distracted me in my\r\ninfatuation with this new acquisition. I went to dinner with them, for I\r\ncould not very well have dined with myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I came back that evening, with my brain slightly confused by a few\r\nglasses of wine, a vague whiff of Oriental perfume delicately titillated\r\nmy olfactory nerves. The heat of the room had warmed the natron,\r\nbitumen, and myrrh in which the _paraschistes_, who cut open the bodies\r\nof the dead, had bathed the corpse of the princess. It was a perfume at\r\nonce sweet and penetrating, a perfume that four thousand years had not\r\nbeen able to dissipate.\r\n\r\nThe Dream of Egypt was Eternity. Her odours have the solidity of granite\r\nand endure as long.\r\n\r\nI soon drank deeply from the black cup of sleep. For a few hours all\r\nremained opaque to me. Oblivion and nothingness inundated me with their\r\nsombre waves.\r\n\r\nYet light gradually dawned upon the darkness of my mind. Dreams\r\ncommenced to touch me softly in their silent flight.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of my soul were opened, and I beheld my chamber as it actually\r\nwas. I might have believed myself awake but for a vague consciousness\r\nwhich assured me that I slept, and that something fantastic was about to\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nThe odour of the myrrh had augmented in intensity, and I felt a slight\r\nheadache, which I very naturally attributed to several glasses of\r\nchampagne that we had drunk to the unknown gods and our future fortunes.\r\n\r\nI peered through my room with a feeling of expectation which I saw\r\nnothing to justify. Every article of furniture was in its proper place.\r\nThe lamp, softly shaded by its globe of ground crystal, burned upon its\r\nbracket; the water-colour sketches shone under their Bohemian glass;\r\nthe curtains hung down languidly; everything wore an aspect of tranquil\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments, however, all this calm interior appeared to become\r\ndisturbed. The woodwork cracked stealthily, the ash-covered log suddenly\r\nemitted a jet of blue flame, and the discs of the pateras seemed like\r\ngreat metallic eyes, watching, like myself, for the things which were\r\nabout to happen.\r\n\r\nMy eyes accidentally fell upon the desk where I had placed the foot of\r\nthe Princess Hermonthis.\r\n\r\nInstead of remaining quiet, as behoved a foot which had been embalmed\r\nfor four thousand years, it commenced to act in a nervous manner,\r\ncontracted itself, and leaped over the papers like a startled frog. One\r\nwould have imagined that it had suddenly been brought into contact with\r\na galvanic battery. I could distinctly hear the dry sound made by its\r\nlittle heel, hard as the hoof of a gazelle.\r\n\r\nI became rather discontented with my acquisition, inasmuch as I wished\r\nmy paper-weights to be of a sedentary disposition, and thought it very\r\nunnatural that feet should walk about without legs, and I commenced to\r\nexperience a feeling closely akin to fear.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I saw the folds of my bed-curtain stir, and heard a bumping\r\nsound, like that caused by some person hopping on one foot across the\r\nfloor. I must confess I became alternately hot and cold, that I felt a\r\nstrange wind chill my back, and that my suddenly rising hair caused my\r\nnight-cap to execute a leap of several yards.\r\n\r\nThe bed-curtains opened and I beheld the strangest figure imaginable\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\nIt was a young girl of a very deep coffee-brown complexion, like the\r\nbayadère Amani, and possessing the purest Egyptian type of perfect\r\nbeauty. Her eyes were almond shaped and oblique, with eyebrows so black\r\nthat they seemed blue; her nose was exquisitely chiselled, almost Greek\r\nin its delicacy of outline; and she might indeed have been taken for a\r\nCorinthian statue of bronze but for the prominence of her cheek-bones\r\nand the slightly African fulness of her lips, which compelled one to\r\nrecognise her as belonging beyond all doubt to the hieroglyphic race\r\nwhich dwelt upon the banks of the Nile.\r\n\r\nHer arms, slender and spindle-shaped like those of very young girls,\r\nwere encircled by a peculiar kind of metal bands and bracelets of glass\r\nbeads; her hair was all twisted into little cords, and she wore upon\r\nher bosom a little idol-figure of green paste, bearing a whip with seven\r\nlashes, which proved it to be an image of Isis; her brow was adorned\r\nwith a shining plate of gold, and a few traces of paint relieved the\r\ncoppery tint of her cheeks.\r\n\r\nAs for her costume, it was very odd indeed.\r\n\r\nFancy a _pagne_, or skirt, all formed of little strips of material\r\nbedizened with red and black hieroglyphics, stiffened with bitumen, and\r\napparently belonging to a freshly unbandaged mummy.\r\n\r\nIn one of those sudden flights of thought so common in dreams I\r\nheard the hoarse falsetto of the bric-à-brac dealer, repeating like\r\na monotonous refrain the phrase he had uttered in his shop with so\r\nenigmatical an intonation:\r\n\r\n'Old Pharaoh will not be well pleased He loved his daughter, the dear\r\nman!'\r\n\r\nOne strange circumstance, which was not at all calculated to restore\r\nmy equanimity, was that the apparition had but one foot; the other was\r\nbroken off at the ankle!\r\n\r\nShe approached the table where the foot was starting and fidgeting about\r\nmore than ever, and there supported herself upon the edge of the desk. I\r\nsaw her eyes fill with pearly gleaming tears.\r\n\r\nAlthough she had not as yet spoken, I fully comprehended the thoughts\r\nwhich agitated her. She looked at her foot--for it was indeed her\r\nown--with an exquisitely graceful expression of coquettish sadness, but\r\nthe foot leaped and ran hither and thither, as though impelled on steel\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\nTwice or thrice she extended her hand to seize it, but could not\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nThen commenced between the Princess Hermonthis and her foot--which\r\nappeared to be endowed with a special life of its own--a very fantastic\r\ndialogue in a most ancient Coptic tongue, such as might have been spoken\r\nthirty centuries ago in the syrinxes of the land of Ser. Luckily I\r\nunderstood Coptic perfectly well that night.\r\n\r\nThe Princess Hermonthis cried, in a voice sweet and vibrant as the tones\r\nof a crystal bell:\r\n\r\n'Well, my dear little foot, you always flee from me, yet I always\r\ntook good care of you. I bathed you with perfumed water in a bowl of\r\nalabaster; I smoothed your heel with pumice-stone mixed with\r\npalm-oil; your nails were cut with golden scissors and polished with a\r\nhippopotamus tooth; I was careful to select _tatbebs_ for you, painted\r\nand embroidered and turned up at the toes, which were the envy of all\r\nthe young girls in Egypt. You wore on your great toe rings bearing the\r\ndevice of the sacred Scarabseus, and you supported one of the lightest\r\nbodies that a lazy foot could sustain.'\r\n\r\nThe foot replied in a pouting and chagrined tone:\r\n\r\n'You know well that I do not belong to myself any longer. I have been\r\nbought and paid for. The old merchant knew what he was about. He bore\r\nyou a grudge for having refused to espouse him. This is an ill turn\r\nwhich he has done you. The Arab who violated your royal coffin in the\r\nsubterranean pits of the necropolis of Thebes was sent thither by him.\r\nHe desired to prevent you from being present at the reunion of the\r\nshadowy nations in the cities below. Have you five pieces of gold for my\r\nransom?'\r\n\r\n'Alas, no! My jewels, my rings, my purses of gold and silver were all\r\nstolen from me,' answered the Princess Hermonthis with a sob.\r\n\r\n'Princess,' I then exclaimed, 'I never retained anybody's foot unjustly.\r\nEven though you have not got the five louis which it cost me, I present\r\nit to you gladly. I should feel unutterably wretched to think that I\r\nwere the cause of so amiable a person as the Princess Hermonthis being\r\nlame.'\r\n\r\nI delivered this discourse in a royally gallant, troubadour tone which\r\nmust have astonished the beautiful Egyptian girl.\r\n\r\nShe turned a look of deepest gratitude upon me, and her eyes shone with\r\nbluish gleams of light.\r\n\r\nShe took her foot, which surrendered itself willingly this time, like a\r\nwoman about to put on her little shoe, and adjusted it to her leg with\r\nmuch skill.\r\n\r\nThis operation over, she took a few steps about the room, as though to\r\nassure herself that she was really no longer lame.\r\n\r\n'Ah, how pleased my father will be! He who was so unhappy because of my\r\nmutilation, and who from the moment of my birth set a whole nation at\r\nwork to hollow me out a tomb so deep that he might preserve me intact\r\nuntil that last day when souls must be weighed in the balance of\r\nAmenthi! Come with me to my father. He will receive you kindly, for you\r\nhave given me back my foot.'\r\n\r\nI thought this proposition natural enough. I arrayed myself in a\r\ndressing-gown of large-flowered pattern, which lent me a very Pharaonic\r\naspect, hurriedly put on a pair of Turkish slippers, and informed the\r\nPrincess Hermonthis that I was ready to follow her.\r\n\r\nBefore starting, Hermonthis took from her neck the little idol of green\r\npaste, and laid it on the scattered sheets of paper which covered the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n'It is only fair,' she observed, smilingly, 'that I should replace your\r\npaper-weight.'\r\n\r\nShe gave me her hand, which felt soft and cold, like the skin of a\r\nserpent, and we departed.\r\n\r\nWe passed for some time with the velocity of an arrow through a fluid\r\nand grayish expanse, in which half-formed silhouettes flitted swiftly by\r\nus, to right and left.\r\n\r\nFor an instant we saw only sky and sea.\r\n\r\nA few moments later obelisks commenced to tower in the distance; pylons\r\nand vast flights of steps guarded by sphinxes became clearly outlined\r\nagainst the horizon.\r\n\r\nWe had reached our destination.\r\n\r\nThe princess conducted me to a mountain of rose-coloured granite, in the\r\nface of which appeared an opening so narrow and low that it would have\r\nbeen difficult to distinguish it from the fissures in the rock, had not\r\nits location been marked by two stelae wrought with sculptures.\r\n\r\nHermonthis kindled a torch and led the way before me.\r\n\r\nWe traversed corridors hewn through the living rock. Their walls,\r\ncovered with hieroglyphics and paintings of allegorical processions,\r\nmight well have occupied thousands of arms for thousands of years in\r\ntheir formation. These corridors of interminable length opened into\r\nsquare chambers, in the midst of which pits had been contrived, through\r\nwhich we descended by cramp-irons or spiral stairways. These pits again\r\nconducted us into other chambers, opening into other corridors, likewise\r\ndecorated with painted sparrow-hawks, serpents coiled in circles, the\r\nsymbols of the _tau_ and _pedum_--prodigious works of art which no\r\nliving eye can ever examine--interminable legends of granite which only\r\nthe dead have time to read through all eternity.\r\n\r\nAt last we found ourselves in a hall so vast, so enormous, so\r\nimmeasurable, that the eye could not reach its limits. Files of\r\nmonstrous columns stretched far out of sight on every side, between\r\nwhich twinkled livid stars of yellowish flame; points of light which\r\nrevealed further depths incalculable in the darkness beyond.\r\n\r\nThe Princess Hermonthis still held my hand, and graciously saluted the\r\nmummies of her acquaintance.\r\n\r\nMy eyes became accustomed to the dim twilight, and objects became\r\ndiscernible.\r\n\r\nI beheld the kings of the subterranean races seated upon thrones--grand\r\nold men, though dry, withered, wrinkled like parchment, and blackened\r\nwith naphtha and bitumen--all wearing _pshents_ of gold, and\r\nbreastplates and gorgets glittering with precious stones, their eyes\r\nimmovably fixed like the eyes of sphinxes, and their long beards\r\nwhitened by the snow of centuries. Behind them stood their peoples,\r\nin the stiff and constrained posture enjoined by Egyptian art, all\r\neternally preserving the attitude prescribed by the hieratic code.\r\nBehind these nations, the cats, ibixes, and crocodiles contemporary\r\nwith them--rendered monstrous of aspect by their swathing bands--mewed,\r\nflapped their wings, or extended their jaws in a saurian giggle.\r\n\r\nAll the Pharaohs were there--Cheops, Chephrenes, Psammetichus,\r\nSesostris, Amenotaph--all the dark rulers of the pyramids and syrinxes.\r\nOn yet higher thrones sat Chronos and Xixouthros, who was contemporary\r\nwith the deluge, and Tubal Cain, who reigned before it.\r\n\r\nThe beard of King Xixouthros had grown seven times around the granite\r\ntable upon which he leaned, lost in deep reverie, and buried in dreams.\r\n\r\nFurther back, through a dusty cloud, I beheld dimly the seventy-two\r\npre-adamite kings, with their seventy-two peoples, for ever passed away.\r\n\r\nAfter permitting me to gaze upon this bewildering spectacle a few\r\nmoments, the Princess Hermonthis presented me to her father Pharaoh, who\r\nfavoured me with a most gracious nod.\r\n\r\n'I have found my foot again! I have found my foot!' cried the princess,\r\nclapping her little hands together with every sign of frantic joy. 'It\r\nwas this gentleman who restored it to me.'\r\n\r\nThe races of Kemi, the races of Nahasi--all the black, bronzed, and\r\ncopper-coloured nations repeated in chorus:\r\n\r\n'The Princess Hermonthis has found her foot again!'\r\n\r\nEven Xixouthros himself was visibly affected.\r\n\r\nHe raised his heavy eyelids, stroked his moustache with his fingers, and\r\nturned upon me a glance weighty with centuries.\r\n\r\n'By Oms, the dog of Hell, and Tmei, daughter of the Sun and of Truth,\r\nthis is a brave and worthy lad!' exclaimed Pharaoh, pointing to me with\r\nhis sceptre, which was terminated with a lotus-flower.\r\n\r\n'What recompense do you desire?'\r\n\r\nFilled with that daring inspired by dreams in which nothing seems\r\nimpossible, I asked him for the hand of the Princess Hermonthis. The\r\nhand seemed to me a very proper antithetic recompense for the foot.\r\n\r\nPharaoh opened wide his great eyes of glass in astonishment at my witty\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n'What country do you come from, and what is your age?'\r\n\r\n'I am a Frenchman, and I am twenty-seven years old venerable Pharaoh.'\r\n\r\n'Twenty-seven years old, and he wishes to espouse the Princess\r\nHermonthis who is thirty centuries old!' cried out at once all the\r\nThrones and all the Circles of Nations.\r\n\r\nOnly Hermonthis herself did not seem to think my request unreasonable.\r\n\r\n'If you were even only two thousand years old,' replied the ancient\r\nking, 'I would willingly give you the princess, but the disproportion\r\nis too great; and, besides, we must give our daughters husbands who will\r\nlast well. You do not know how to preserve yourselves any longer. Even\r\nthose who died only fifteen centuries ago are already no more than a\r\nhandful of dust. Behold, my flesh is solid as basalt, my bones are bars\r\nof steel!\r\n\r\n'I will be present on the last day of the world with the same body and\r\nthe same features which I had during my lifetime. My daughter Hermonthis\r\nwill last longer than a statue of bronze.\r\n\r\n'Then the last particles of your dust will have been scattered abroad\r\nby the winds, and even Isis herself, who was able to find the atoms of\r\nOsiris, would scarce be able to recompose your being.\r\n\r\n'See how vigorous I yet remain, and how mighty is my grasp,' he added,\r\nshaking my hand in the English fashion with a strength that buried my\r\nrings in the flesh of my fingers.\r\n\r\nHe squeezed me so hard that I awoke, and found my friend Alfred shaking\r\nme by the arm to make me get up.\r\n\r\n'Oh, you everlasting sleeper! Must I have you carried out into the\r\nmiddle of the street, and fireworks exploded in your ears? It is\r\nafternoon. Don't you recollect your promise to take me with you to see\r\nM. Aguado's Spanish pictures?'\r\n\r\n'God! I forgot all, all about it,' I answered, dressing myself\r\nhurriedly. 'We will go there at once. I have the permit lying there on\r\nmy desk.'\r\n\r\nI started to find it, but fancy my astonishment when I beheld, instead\r\nof the mummy's foot I had purchased the evening before, the little green\r\npaste idol left in its place by the Princess Hermonthis!",
