But, by reason most Ladies take no delight\r\nin Philosophical Arguments, I separated some from the mentioned\r\nObservations, and caused them to go out by themselves, that I might\r\nexpress my Respects, in presenting to Them such Fancies as my\r\nContemplations did afford. The First Part is Romancical; the Second,\r\nPhilosophical; and the Third is meerly Fancy; or (as I may call it)\r\nFantastical. And if (Noble Ladies) you should chance to take pleasure in\r\nreading these Fancies, I shall account my self a Happy Creatoress: If\r\nnot, I must be content to live a Melancholly Life in my own World; which\r\nI cannot call a Poor World, if Poverty be only want of Gold, and Jewels:\r\nfor, there is more Gold in it, than all the Chymists ever made; or, (as\r\nI verily believe) will ever be able to make. As for the Rocks of\r\nDiamonds, I wish, with all my Soul, they might be shared amongst my\r\nNoble Female Friends; upon which condition, I would willingly quit my\r\nPart: And of the Gold, I should desire only so much as might suffice to\r\nrepair my Noble Lord and Husband's Losses: for, I am not Covetous, but\r\nas Ambitious as ever any of my Sex was, is, or can be; which is the\r\ncause, That though I cannot be Henry the Fifth, or Charles the Second;\r\nyet, I will endeavour to be, Margaret the First: and, though I have\r\nneither Power, Time nor Occasion, to be a great Conqueror, like\r\nAlexander, or Cesar; yet, rather than not be Mistress of a World, since\r\nFortune and the Fates would give me none, I have made One of my own. And\r\nthus, believing, or, at least, hoping, that no Creature can, or will,\r\nEnvy me for this World of mine, I remain,\r\n\r\nNoble Ladies, Your Humble Servant, M. Newcastle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Merchant travelling into a foreign Country, fell extreamly in Love\r\nwith a young Lady; but being a stranger in that Nation, and beneath her,\r\nboth in Birth and Wealth, he could have but little hopes of obtaining\r\nhis desire; however his Love growing more and more vehement upon him,\r\neven to the slighting of all difficulties, he resolved at last to Steal\r\nher away; which he had the better opportunity to do, because her\r\nFather's house was not far from the Sea, and she often using to gather\r\nshells upon the shore accompanied not with above two to three of her\r\nservants it encouraged him the more to execute his design. Thus coming\r\none time with a little leight Vessel, not unlike a Packet-boat, mann'd\r\nwith some few Sea-men, and well victualled, for fear of some accidents,\r\nwhich might perhaps retard their journey, to the place where she used to\r\nrepair; he forced her away: But when he fancied himself the happiest man\r\nof the World, he proved to be the most unfortunate; for Heaven frowning\r\nat his Theft, raised such a Tempest, as they knew not what to do, or\r\nwhither to steer their course; so that the Vessel, both by its own\r\nleightness, and the violent motion of the Wind, was carried as swift as\r\nan Arrow out of a Bow, towards the North-pole, and in a short time\r\nreached the Icy Sea, where the wind forced it amongst huge pieces of\r\nIce; but being little, and leight, it did by the assistance and favour\r\nof the gods to this virtuous Lady, so turn and wind through those\r\nprecipices, as if it had been guided by some experienced Pilot, and\r\nskilful Mariner: But alas! Those few men which were in it, not knowing\r\nwhither they went, nor what was to be done in so strange an Adventure,\r\nand not being provided for so cold a Voyage, were all frozen to death;\r\nthe young Lady onely, by the light of her Beauty, the heat of her Youth,\r\nand Protection of the Gods, remaining alive: Neither was it a wonder\r\nthat the men did freeze to death; for they were not onely driven to the\r\nvery end or point of the Pole of that World, but even to another Pole of\r\nanother World, which joined close to it; so that the cold having a\r\ndouble strength at the conjunction of those two Poles, was\r\ninsupportable: At last, the Boat still passing on, was forced into\r\nanother World; for it is impossible to round this Worlds Globe from Pole\r\nto Pole, so as we do from East to West; because the Poles of the other\r\nWorld, joining to the Poles of this, do not allow any further passage to\r\nsurround the World that way; but if any one arrives to either of these\r\nPoles, he is either forced to return, or to enter into another World:\r\nand lest you should scruple at it, and think, if it were thus, those\r\nthat live at the Poles would either see two Suns at one time, or else\r\nthey would never want the Sun's light for six months together, as it is\r\ncommonly believed: You must know, that each of these Worlds having its\r\nown Sun to enlighten it, they move each one in their peculiar Circles;\r\nwhich motion is so just and exact, that neither can hinder or obstruct\r\nthe other; for they do not exceed their Tropicks: and although they\r\nshould meet, yet we in this World cannot so well perceive them, by\r\nreason of the brightness of our Sun, which being nearer to us, obstructs\r\nthe splendor of the Sun of the other World, they being too far off to be\r\ndiscerned by our optick perception, except we use very good Telescopes;\r\nby which, skilful Astronomers have often observed two or three Suns at once.\r\nBut to return to the wandering Boat, and the distressed Lady; she seeing\r\nall the Men dead, found small comfort in life; their Bodies which were\r\npreserved all that while from putrefaction and stench, by the extremity\r\nof cold, began now to thaw, and corrupt; whereupon she having not\r\nstrength enough to fling them over-board, was forced to remove out of\r\nher small Cabine, upon the deck, to avoid the nauseous smell; and\r\nfinding the Boat swim between two plains of Ice, as a stream that runs\r\nbetwixt two shores, at last perceived land, but covered all with Snow:\r\nfrom which came, walking upon the Ice, strange Creatures, in shape like\r\nBears, only they went upright as men; those Creatures coming near the\r\nBoat, catched hold of it with their Paws, that served them instead of\r\nhands; some two or three of them entred first; and when they came out,\r\nthe rest went in one after another; at last having viewed and observed\r\nall that was in the Boat, they spake to each other in a language which\r\nthe Lady did not understand; and having carried her out of the Boat,\r\nsunk it, together with the dead men.\r\n\r\nThe Lady now finding her self in so strange a place, and amongst such\r\nwonderful kind of Creatures, was extreamly strucken with fear, and could\r\nentertain no other Thoughts, but that every moment her life was to be a\r\nsacrifice to their cruelty; but those Bear-like Creatures, how terrible\r\nsoever they appear'd to her sight, yet were they so far from exercising\r\nany cruelty upon her, that rather they shewed her all civility and\r\nkindness imaginable; for she being not able to go upon the Ice, by\r\nreason of its slipperiness, they took her up in their rough arms, and\r\ncarried her into their City, where instead of Houses, they had Caves\r\nunder ground; and as soon as they enter'd the City, both Males and\r\nFemales, young and old, flockt together to see this Lady, holding up\r\ntheir Paws in admiration; at last having brought her into a certain\r\nlarge and spacious Cave, which they intended for her reception, they\r\nleft her to the custody of the Females, who entertained her with all\r\nkindness and respect, and gave her such victuals as they used to eat;\r\nbut seeing her Constitution neither agreed with the temper of that\r\nClimate, nor their Diet, they were resolved to carry her into another\r\nIsland of a warmer temper; in which were men like Foxes, onely walking\r\nin an upright shape, who received their neighbours the Bear-men with\r\ngreat civility and Courtship, very much admiring this beauteous Lady;\r\nand having discoursed some while together, agreed at last to make her a\r\nPresent to the Emperor of their World; to which end, after she had made\r\nsome short stay in the same place, they brought her cross that Island to\r\na large River, whose stream run smooth and clear, like Chrystal; in\r\nwhich were numerous Boats, much like our Fox-traps; in one whereof she\r\nwas carried, some of the Bear- and Fox-men waiting on her; and as soon\r\nas they had crossed the River, they came into an Island where there were\r\nMen which had heads, beaks and feathers, like wild-Geese, onely they\r\nwent in an upright shape, like the Bear-men and Fox-men: their rumps\r\nthey carried between their legs, their wings were of the same length\r\nwith their Bodies, and their tails of an indifferent size, trailing\r\nafter them like a Ladie's Garment; and after the Bear- and Fox-men had\r\ndeclared their intention and design to their Neighbours, the Geese- or\r\nBird-men, some of them joined to the rest, and attended the Lady through\r\nthat Island, till they came to another great and large River, where\r\nthere was a preparation made of many Boats, much like Birds nests, onely\r\nof a bigger size; and having crost that River, they arrived into another\r\nIsland, which was of a pleasant and mild temper, full of Woods and the\r\nInhabitants thereof were Satyrs, who received both the Bear- Fox- and\r\nBird men, with all respect and civility; and after some conferences (for\r\nthey all understood each others language) some chief of the Satyrs\r\njoining to them, accompanied the Lady out of that Island to another\r\nRiver, wherein were many handsome and commodious Barges; and having\r\ncrost that River, they entered into a large and spacious Kingdom, the\r\nmen whereof were of a Grass-Green Complexion, who entertained them very\r\nkindly, and provided all conveniences for their further voyage: hitherto\r\nthey had onely crost Rivers, but now they could not avoid the open Seas\r\nany longer; wherefore they made their Ships and tacklings ready to sail\r\nover into the Island, where the Emperor of the Blazing- world (for so it\r\nwas call'd) kept his residence. Very good Navigators they were; and\r\nthough they had no knowledg of the Load-stone, or Needle or pendulous\r\nWatches, yet (which was as serviceable to them) they had subtile\r\nobservations, and great practice; in so much that they could not onely\r\ntell the depth of the Sea in every place, but where there were shelves\r\nof Sand, Rocks, and other obstructions to be avoided by skilful and\r\nexperienced Sea-men: Besides, they were excellent Augurers, which skill\r\nthey counted more necessary and beneficial then the use of Compasses,\r\nCards, Watches, and the like; but, above the rest, they had an\r\nextraordinary Art, much to be taken notice of by Experimental\r\nPhilosophers, and that was a certain Engin, which would draw in a great\r\nquantity of Air, and shoot forth Wind with a great force; this Engine in\r\na calm, they placed behind their Ships, and in a storm, before; for it\r\nserved against the raging waves, like Cannons against an hostile Army,\r\nor besieged Town; it would batter and beat the waves in pieces, were\r\nthey as high as Steeples; and as soon as a breach was made, they forced\r\ntheir passage through, in spight even of the most furious wind, using\r\ntwo of those Engins at every Ship, one before, to beat off the waves,\r\nand another behind to drive it on; so that the artificial wind had the\r\nbetter of the natural; for, it had a greater advantage of the waves,\r\nthen the natural of the Ships: the natural being above the face of the\r\nWater, could not without a down right motion enter or press into the\r\nShips; whereas the artificial with a sideward-motion, did pierce into\r\nthe bowels of the Waves: Moreover, it is to be observed, that in a great\r\nTempest they would join their Ships in battel-aray: and when they feared\r\nWind and Waves would be too strong for them, if they divided their\r\nShips; they joined as many together as the compass or advantage of the\r\nplaces of the Liquid Element would give them leave. For, their Ships\r\nwere so ingeniously contrived, that they could fasten them together as\r\nclose as a Honey-comb, without waste of place; and being thus united, no\r\nWind nor Waves were able to separate them. The Emperor's Ships, were all\r\nof Gold; but the Merchants and Skippers, of Leather; the Golden Ships\r\nwere not much heavier then ours of Wood, by reason they were neatly\r\nmade, and required not such thickness, neither were they troubled with\r\nPitch, Tar, Pumps, Guns, and the like, which make our Woodden-Ships very\r\nheavy; for though they were not all of a piece, yet they were so well\r\nsodder'd, that there was no fear of Leaks, Chinks, or Clefts; and as for\r\nGuns, there was no use of them, because they had no other enemies but\r\nthe Winds: But the Leather Ships were not altogether so sure, although\r\nmuch leighter; besides, they were pitched to keep out Water.\r\n\r\nHaving thus prepar'd, and order'd their Navy, they went on in despight\r\nof Calm or Storm: And though the Lady at first fancied her self in a\r\nvery sad condition, and her mind was much tormented with doubts and\r\nfears, not knowing whether this strange Adventure would tend to her\r\nsafety or destruction; yet she being withal of a generous spirit, and\r\nready wit, considering what dangers she had past, and finding those\r\nsorts of men civil and diligent attendants to her, took courage, and\r\nendeavoured to learn their language; which after she had obtained so\r\nfar, that partly by some words and signs she was able to apprehend their\r\nmeaning, she was so far from being afraid of them, that she thought her\r\nself not onely safe, but very happy in their company: By which we may\r\nsee, that Novelty discomposes the mind, but acquaintance settles it in\r\npeace and tranquillity. At last, having passed by several rich Islands\r\nand Kingdoms, they went towards Paradise, which was the seat of the\r\nEmperor; and coming in sight of it, rejoiced very much; the Lady at\r\nfirst could perceive nothing but high Rocks, which seemed to touch the\r\nSkies; and although they appear'd not of an equal heigth, yet they\r\nseemed to be all one piece, without partitions: but at last drawing\r\nnearer, she perceived a clift, which was a part of those Rocks, out of\r\nwhich she spied coming forth a great number of Boats, which afar off\r\nshewed like a company of Ants, marching one after another; the Boats\r\nappeared like the holes or partitions in a Honey-comb, and when joined\r\ntogether, stood as close; the men were of several Complexions, but none\r\nlike any of our World; and when both the Boats and Ships met, they\r\nsaluted and spake to each other very courteously; for there was but one\r\nlanguage in all that World: nor no more but one Emperor, to whom they\r\nall submitted with the greatest duty and obedience, which made them live\r\nin a continued Peace and Happiness; not acquainted with Foreign Wars or\r\nHome-bred Insurrections. The Lady now being arrived at this place, was\r\ncarried out of her Ship into one of those Boats, and conveighed through\r\nthe same passage (for there was no other) into that part of the World\r\nwhere the Emperor did reside; which part was very pleasant, and of a\r\nmild temper: Within it self it was divided by a great number of vast and\r\nlarge Rivers, all ebbing and flowing, into several Islands of unequal\r\ndistance from each other, which in most parts were as pleasant,\r\nhealthful, rich, and fruitful, as Nature could make them; and, as I\r\nmentioned before, secure from all Foreign Invasions, by reason there was\r\nbut one way to enter, and that like a Labyrinth, so winding and turning\r\namong the Rocks, that no other Vessels but small Boats, could pass,\r\ncarrying not above three passengers at a time: On each side all along\r\nthe narrow and winding River, there were several Cities, some of Marble,\r\nsome of Alabaster, some of Agat, some of Amber, some of Coral, and some\r\nof other precious materials not known in our world; all which after the\r\nLady had passed, she came to the Imperial City, named Paradise, which\r\nappeared in form like several Islands; for, Rivers did run betwixt every\r\nstreet, which together with the Bridges, whereof there was a great\r\nnumber, were all paved. The City it self was built of Gold; and their\r\nArchitectures were noble, stately, and magnificent, not like our Modern,\r\nbut like those in the Romans time; for, our Modern Buildings are like\r\nthose Houses which Children use to make of Cards, one story above\r\nanother, fitter for Birds, then Men; but theirs were more Large, and\r\nBroad, then high; the highest of them did not exceed two stories,\r\nbesides those rooms that were under-ground, as Cellars, and other\r\nOffices. The Emperor's Palace stood upon an indifferent ascent from the\r\nImperial City; at the top of which ascent was a broad Arch, supported by\r\nseveral Pillars, which went round the Palace, and contained four of our\r\nEnglish miles in compass: within the Arch stood the Emperor's Guard,\r\nwhich consisted of several sorts of Men; at every half mile, was a Gate\r\nto enter, and every Gate was of a different fashion; the first, which\r\nallowed a passage from the Imperial City into the Palace, had on either\r\nhand a Cloyster, the outward part whereof stood upon Arches sustained by\r\nPillars, but the inner part was close: Being entred through the Gate,\r\nthe Palace it self appear'd in its middle like the Isle of a Church, a\r\nmile and a half long, and half a mile broad; the roof of it was all\r\nArched, and rested upon Pillars, so artificially placed that a stranger\r\nwould lose himself therein without a Guide; at the extream sides, that\r\nis, between the outward and inward part of the Cloyster, were Lodgings\r\nfor Attendants; and in the midst of the Palace, the Emperor's own Rooms;\r\nwhose Lights were placed at the top of every one, because of the heat of\r\nthe Sun: the Emperor's appartment for State was no more inclosed then\r\nthe rest; onely an Imperial Throne was in every appartment, of which the\r\nseveral adornments could not be perceived until one entered, because the\r\nPillars were so just opposite to one another, that all the adornments\r\ncould not be seen at one. The first part of the Palace was, as the\r\nImperial City, all of Gold; and when it came to the Emperors appartment,\r\nit was so rich with Diamonds, Pearls, Rubies, and the like precious\r\nStones, that it surpasses my skill to enumerate them all. Amongst the\r\nrest, the Imperial Room of State appear'd most magnificent; it was paved\r\nwith green Diamonds (for there are in that World Diamonds of all\r\nColours) so artificially, as it seemed but of one piece; the Pillars\r\nwere set with Diamonds so close, and in such a manner, that they\r\nappear'd most Glorious to the sight; between every Pillar was a Bow or\r\nArch of a certain sort of Diamonds, the like whereof our World does not\r\nafford; which being placed in every one of the Arches in several rows,\r\nseemed just like so many Rainbows of several different colours. The roof\r\nof the Arches was of blew Diamonds, and in the midst thereof was a\r\nCarbuncle, which represented the Sun; and the Rising and Setting-Sun at\r\nthe East and West-side of the Room were made of Rubies. Out of this Room\r\nthere was a passage into the Emperor's Bed-Chamber, the Walls whereof\r\nwere of Jet, and the Floor of black Marble; the Roof was of Mother of\r\nPearl, where the Moon and Blazing-Stars were represented by white\r\nDiamonds, and his Bed was made of Diamonds and Carbuncles.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the Lady brought before the Emperor, but he conceived her\r\nto be some Goddess, and offered to worship her; which she refused,\r\ntelling him, (for by that time she had pretty well learned their\r\nLanguage) that although she came out of another world, yet was she but a\r\nmortal. At which the Emperor rejoycing, made her his Wife, and gave her\r\nan absolute power to rule and govern all that World as she pleased. But\r\nher subjects, who could hardly be perswaded to believe her mortal,\r\ntender'd her all the Veneration and Worship due to a Deity.\r\n\r\nHer Accoustrement after she was made Empress, was as followeth: On her\r\nhead she wore a Cap of Pearl, and a Half-moon of Diamonds just before\r\nit; on the top of her Crown came spreading over a broad Carbuncle, cut\r\nin the form of the Sun; her Coat was of Pearl, mixt with blew Diamonds,\r\nand frindged with red ones; her Buskins and Sandals were of green\r\nDiamonds; In her left hand she held a Buckler, to signifie the Defence\r\nof her Dominions; which Buckler was made of that sort of Diamond as has\r\nseveral different Colours; and being cut and made in the form of an\r\nArch, shewed like a Rain-bow; In her right hand she carried a Spear made\r\nof white Diamond, cut like the tail of a Blazing Star, which signified\r\nthat she was ready to assault those that proved her Enemies.\r\n\r\nNone was allowed to use or wear Gold but those of the Imperial Race,\r\nwhich were the onely Nobles of the State; nor durst any one wear Jewels\r\nbut the Emperor, the Empress and their Eldest Son; notwithstanding that\r\nthey had an infinite quantity both of Gold and precious Stones in that\r\nWorld; for they had larger extents of Gold, then our Arabian Sands;\r\ntheir precious Stones were Rocks, and their Diamonds of several Colours;\r\nthey used no Coyn, but all their Traffick was by exchange of several\r\nCommodities.\r\n\r\nTheir Priests and Governors were Princes of the Imperial Blood, and made\r\nEunuches for that purpose; and as for the ordinary sort of men in that\r\npart of the World where the Emperor resided, they were of several\r\nComplexions; not white, black, tawny, olive or ash-coloured; but some\r\nappear'd of an Azure, some of a deep Purple, some of a Grass-green, some\r\nof a Scarlet, some of an Orange-colour, &c. Which Colours and\r\nComplexions, whether they were made by the bare reflection of light,\r\nwithout the assistance of small particles; or by the help of well-ranged\r\nand order'd Atoms; or by a continual agitation of little Globules; or by\r\nsome pressing and re-acting motion, I am not able to determine. The rest\r\nof the Inhabitants of that World, were men of several different sorts,\r\nshapes, figures, dispositions, and humors, as I have already made\r\nmention, heretofore; some were Bear-men, some Worm-men, some Fish- or\r\nMear-men, otherwise called Syrens; some Bird-men, some Fly-men, some\r\nAnt-men, some Geese-men, some Spider-men, some Lice-men, some Fox-men,\r\nsome Ape-men, some Jack daw-men, some Magpie-men, some Parrot-men, some\r\nSatyrs, some Gyants, and many more, which I cannot all remember; and of\r\nthese several sorts of men, each followed such a profession as was most\r\nproper for the nature of their Species, which the Empress encouraged\r\nthem in, especially those that had applied themselves to the study of\r\nseveral Arts and Sciences; for they were as ingenious and witty in the\r\ninvention of profitable and useful Arts, as we are in our world, nay,\r\nmore; and to that end she erected Schools, and founded several\r\nSocieties. The Bear-men were to be her Experimental Philosophers, the\r\nBird-men her Astronomers, the Fly- Worm- and Fish-men her Natural\r\nPhilosophers, the Ape-men her Chymists, the Satyrs her Galenick\r\nPhysicians, the Fox-men her Politicians, the Spider- and Lice-men her\r\nMathematicians, the Jackdaw- Magpie- and Parrot-men her Orators and\r\nLogicians, the Gyants her Architects, &c. But before all things, she\r\nhaving got a Soveraign power from the Emperor over all the World,\r\ndesired to be informed both of the manner of their Religion and\r\nGovernment; and to that end she called the Priests and States men, to\r\ngive her an account of either. Of the States men she enquired, first,\r\nWhy they had so few Laws? To which they answered, That many Laws made\r\nmany Divisions, which most commonly did breed Factions, and at last\r\nbrake out into open Wars. Next, she asked, Why they preferred the\r\nMonarchical form of Government before any other? They answered, That as\r\nit was natural for one Body to have but one Head, so it was also natural\r\nfor a Politick body to have but one Governor; and that a Common-wealth,\r\nwhich had many Governors was like a Monster with many Heads. Besides,\r\nsaid they, a Monarchy is a divine form of Government, and agrees most\r\nwith our Religion: For as there is but one God, whom we all unanimously\r\nworship and adore with one Faith; so we are resolved to have but one\r\nEmperor, to whom we all submit with one obedience.\r\n\r\nThen the Empress seeing that the several sorts of her Subjects had each\r\ntheir Churches apart, asked the Priests, whether they were of several\r\nReligions? They answered her Majesty, That there was no more but one\r\nReligion in all that World, nor no diversity of opinions in that same\r\nReligion for though there were several sorts of men, yet had they all\r\nbut one opinion concerning the Worship and Adoration of God. The Empress\r\nasked them, Whether they were Jews, Turks, or Christians? We do not\r\nknow, said they, what Religions those are; but we do all unanimously\r\nacknowledg, worship and adore the Onely, Omnipotent, and Eternal God,\r\nwith all reverence, submission, and duty. Again, the Empress enquired,\r\nWhether they had several Forms of Worship? They answered, No: For our\r\nDevotion and Worship consists onely in Prayers, which we frame according\r\nto our several Necessities, in Petitions, Humiliations, Thanksgiving,\r\n&c. Truly, replied the Empress, I thought you had been either Jews, or\r\nTurks, because I never perceived any Women in your Congregations: But\r\nwhat is the reason, you bar them from your religious Assemblies? It is\r\nnot fit, said they, that Men and Women should be promiscuously together\r\nin time of Religious Worship; for their company hinders Devotion, and\r\nmakes many, instead of praying to God, direct their Devotion to their\r\nMistresses. But, asked the Empress, Have they no Congregation of their\r\nown, to perform the duties of Divine Worship, as well as Men? No,\r\nanswered they: but they stay at home, and say their Prayers by\r\nthemselves in their Closets. Then the Empress desir'd to know the reason\r\nwhy the Priests and Governors of their World were made Eunuchs? They\r\nanswer'd, To keep them from Marriage: For Women and Children most\r\ncommonly make disturbance both in Church and State. But, said she, Women\r\nand Children have no Employment in Church or State. 'Tis true, answer'd\r\nthey; but, although they are not admitted to publick Employments, yet\r\nare they so prevalent with their Husbands and Parents, that many times\r\nby their importunate perswasions, they cause as much, nay, more mischief\r\nsecretly, then if they had the management of publick Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Empress having received an information of what concerned both Church\r\nand State, passed some time in viewing the Imperial Palace, where she\r\nadmired much the skil and ingenuity of the Architects, and enquired of\r\nthem, first, Why they built their Houses no higher then two stories from\r\nthe Ground? They answered her Majesty, That the lower their Buildings\r\nwere, the less were they subject either to the heat of the Sun, or Wind,\r\nTempest, Decay, &c. Then she desired to know the reason, why they made\r\nthem so thick? They answered, That, the thicker the Walls were, the\r\nwarmer they were in Winter, the cooler in Summer; for their thickness\r\nkept out both the Cold and Heat. Lastly, she asked, Why they Arched\r\ntheir Roofs, and made so many Pillars? They replied, That Arches and\r\nPillars, did not onely grace a Building very much, and caused it to\r\nappear Magnificent, but made it also firm and lasting.\r\n\r\nThe Empress was very well satisfied with their answers; and after some\r\ntime, when she thought that her new founded societies of the Vertuoso's\r\nhad made a good progress in the several Employments she had put them\r\nupon, she caused a Convocation first of the Bird-men, and commanded them\r\nto give her a true relation of the two Cœlestial Bodies, viz. the Sun\r\nand Moon, which they did with all the obedience and faithfulness\r\nbefitting their duty.\r\n\r\nThe Sun, as much as they could observe, they related to be a firm or\r\nsolid Stone, of a vast bigness; of colour yellowish, and of an\r\nextraordinary splendor: But the Moon, they said, was of a whitish\r\ncolour; and although she looked dim in the presence of the Sun, yet had\r\nshe her own light, and was a shining body of her self, as might be\r\nperceived by her vigorous appearance in Moon-shiny-nights; the\r\ndifference onely betwixt her own and the Sun's light was, that the Sun\r\ndid strike his beams in a direct line; but the Moon never respected the\r\nCentre of their World in a right line, but her Centre was always\r\nexcentrical. The Spots both in the Sun and Moon, as far as they were\r\nable to perceive, they affirmed to be nothing else but flaws and stains\r\nof their stony Bodies. Concerning the heat of the Sun, they were not of\r\none opinion; some would have the Sun hot in it self, alledging an old\r\nTradition, that it should at some time break asunder, and burn the\r\nHeavens, and consume this world into hot Embers, which, said they, could\r\nnot be done, if the Sun were not fiery of it self. Others again said,\r\nThis opinion could not stand with reason; for Fire being a destroyer of\r\nall things, the Sun-Stone after this manner would burn up all the near\r\nadjoining Bodies: Besides, said they, Fire cannot subsist without fuel;\r\nand the Sun-Stone having nothing to feed on, would in a short time\r\nconsume it self; wherefore they thought it more probable that the Sun\r\nwas not actually hot, but onely by the reflection of its light; so that\r\nits heat was an effect of its light, both being immaterial. But this\r\nopinion again was laught at by others, and rejected as ridiculous, who\r\nthought it impossible that one immaterial should produce another; and\r\nbelieved that both the light and heat of the Sun proceeded from a swift\r\nCircular motion of the Æthereal Globules, which by their striking upon\r\nthe Optick nerve, caused light, and their motion produced heat: But\r\nneither would this opinion hold; for, said some, then it would follow,\r\nthat the sight of Animals is the cause of light; and that, were there no\r\neyes, there would be no light; which was against all sense and reason.\r\nThus they argued concerning the heat and light of the Sun; but, which is\r\nremarkable, none did say, that the Sun was a Globous fluid body, and had\r\na swift Circular motion; but all agreed, It was fixt and firm like a\r\nCenter, and therefore they generally called it the Sun-Stone.\r\n\r\nThen the Empress asked them the reason, Why the Sun and Moon did often\r\nappear in different postures or shapes, as sometimes magnified,\r\nsometimes diminished; sometimes elevated, otherwhiles depressed; now\r\nthrown to the right, and then to the left? To which some of the Bird-men\r\nanswered, That it proceeded from the various degrees of heat and cold,\r\nwhich are found in the Air, from whence did follow a differing density\r\nand rarity; and likewise from the vapours that are interposed, whereof\r\nthose that ascend are higher and less dense then the ambient air, but\r\nthose which descend are heavier and more dense. But others did with more\r\nprobability affirm, that it was nothing else but the various patterns of\r\nthe Air; for like as Painters do not copy out one and the same original\r\njust alike at all times; so, said they, do several parts of the Air make\r\ndifferent patterns of the luminous Bodies of the Sun and Moon: which\r\npatterns, as several copies, the sensitive motions do figure out in the\r\nsubstance of our eyes.\r\n\r\nThis answer the Empress liked much better then the former, and enquired\r\nfurther, What opinion they had of those Creatures that are called the\r\nmotes of the Sun? To which they answered, That they were nothing else\r\nbut streams of very small, rare and transparent particles, through which\r\nthe Sun was represented as through a glass: for if they were not\r\ntransparent, said they, they would eclipse the light of the Sun; and if\r\nnot rare and of an airy substance, they would hinder Flies from flying\r\nin the Air, at least retard their flying motion: Nevertheless, although\r\nthey were thinner then the thinnest vapour, yet were they not so thin as\r\nthe body of air, or else they would not be perceptible by animal sight.\r\nThen the Empress asked, Whether they were living Creatures? They\r\nanswered, Yes: Because they did encrease and decrease, and were\r\nnourished by the presence, and starved by the absence of the Sun.\r\n\r\nHaving thus finished their discourse of the Sun and Moon, the Empress\r\ndesired to know what Stars there were besides? But they answer'd, that\r\nthey could perceive in that World none other but Blazing Stars, and from\r\nthence it had the name that it was called the Blazing-World; and these\r\nBlazing-Stars, said they, were such solid, firm and shining bodies as\r\nthe Sun and Moon, not of a Globular, but of several sorts of figures:\r\nsome had tails; and some, other kinds of shapes.\r\n\r\nAfter this, The Empress asked them, What kind of substance or creature\r\nthe Air was? The Bird-men answered, That they could have no other\r\nperception of the Air, but by their own Respiration: For, said they,\r\nsome bodies are onely subject to touch, others onely to sight, and\r\nothers onely to smell; but some are subject to none of our exterior\r\nSenses: For Nature is so full of variety, that our weak Senses cannot\r\nperceive all the various sorts of her Creatures; neither is there any\r\none object perceptible by all our Senses, no more then several objects\r\nare by one sense. I believe you, replied the Empress; but if you can\r\ngive no account of the Air, said she, you will hardly be able to inform\r\nme how Wind is made; for they say, that Wind is nothing but motion of\r\nthe Air. The Bird-men answer'd, That they observed Wind to be more dense\r\nthen Air, and therefore subject to the sense of Touch; but what properly\r\nWind was, and the manner how it was made, they could not exactly tell;\r\nsome said, it was caused by the Clouds falling on each other; and\r\nothers, that it was produced of a hot and dry exhalation: which\r\nascending, was driven down again by the coldness of the Air that is in\r\nthe middle Region, and by reason of its leightness, could not go\r\ndirectly to the bottom, but was carried by the Air up and down: Some\r\nwould have it a flowing Water of the Air; and others again, a flowing\r\nAir moved by the blaz of the Stars.\r\n\r\nBut the Empress, seeing they could not agree concerning the cause of\r\nWind, asked, Whether they could tell how Snow was made? To which they\r\nanswered That according to their observation, Snow was made by a\r\ncommixture of Water, and some certain extract of the Element of Fire\r\nthat is under the Moon; a small portion of which extract, being mixed\r\nwith Water, and beaten by Air or Wind, made a white Froth called Snow;\r\nwhich being after some while dissolved by the heat of the same spirit,\r\nturned to Water again. This observation amazed the Empress very much;\r\nfor she had hitherto believed, That Snow was made by cold motions, and\r\nnot by such an agitation or beating of a fiery extract upon water: Nor\r\ncould she be perswaded to believe it until the Fish- or Mear-men had\r\ndelivered their observation upon the making of Ice, which, they said,\r\nwas not produced, as some hitherto conceived, by the motion of the Air,\r\nraking the Superficies of the Earth, but by some strong saline vapour\r\narising out of the Seas, which condensed Water into Ice; and the more\r\nquantity there was of that vapour, the greater were the Mountains of\r\nPrecipices of Ice; but the reason that it did not so much freeze in the\r\nTorrid Zone, or under the Ecliptick, as near or under the Poles, was,\r\nthat this vapour in those places being drawn up by the Sun-beams into\r\nthe middle Region of the Air, was onely condensed into Water, and fell\r\ndown in showres of Rain; when as, under the Poles, the heat of the Sun\r\nbeing not so vehement, the same vapour had no force or power to rise so\r\nhigh, and therefore caused so much Ice, by ascending and acting onely\r\nupon the surface of water.\r\n\r\nThis Relation confirmed partly the observation of the Bird-men\r\nconcerning the cause of Snow; but since they had made mention that that\r\nsame extract, which by its commixture with Water made Snow, proceeded\r\nfrom the Element of Fire, that is under the Moon: The Emperess asked\r\nthem, of what nature that Elementary Fire was; whether it was like\r\nordinary Fire here upon Earth, or such a Fire as is within the bowels of\r\nthe Earth, and as the famous Mountains Vesuvius and Ætna do burn withal;\r\nor whether it was such a sort of fire, as is found in flints, &c. They\r\nanswered, That the Elementary Fire, which is underneath the Sun, was not\r\nso solid as any of those mentioned fires; because it had no solid fuel\r\nto feed on; but yet it was much like the flame of ordinary fire, onely\r\nsomewhat more thin and fluid; for Flame, said they, is nothing else but\r\nthe airy part of a fired Body.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Empress asked the Bird-men of the nature of Thunder and\r\nLightning? and whether it was not caused by roves of Ice falling upon\r\neach other? To which they answered, That it was not made that way, but\r\nby an encounter of cold and heat; so that an exhalation being kindled in\r\nthe Clouds, did dash forth Lightning, and that there were so many\r\nrentings of Clouds as there were Sounds and Cracking noises: But this\r\nopinion was contradicted by others, who affirmed that Thunder was a\r\nsudden and monstrous Blaz, stirred up in the Air, and did not always\r\nrequire a Cloud; but the Empress not knowing what they meant by Blaz\r\n(for even they themselves were not able to explain the sense of this\r\nword) liked the former better; and, to avoid hereafter tedious disputes,\r\nand have the truth of the Phænomena's of Cœlestial Bodies more exactly\r\nknown, commanded the Bear-men, which were her Experimental Philosophers,\r\nto observe them through such Instruments as are called Telescopes, which\r\nthey did according to her Majesties Command; but these Telescopes caused\r\nmore differences and divisions amongst them, then ever they had before;\r\nfor some said, they perceived that the Sun stood still, and the Earth\r\ndid move about it; others were of opinion, that they both did move; and\r\nothers said again, that the Earth stood still, and Sun did move; some\r\ncounted more Stars then others; some discovered new Stars never seen\r\nbefore; some fell into a great dispute with others concerning the\r\nbigness of the Stars; some said, The Moon was another World like their\r\nTerrestrial Globe, and the spots therein were Hills and Vallies; but\r\nothers would have the spots to be the Terrestrial parts, and the smooth\r\nand glossie parts, the Sea: At last, the Empress commanded them to go\r\nwith their Telescopes to the very end of the Pole that was joined to the\r\nWorld she came from, and try whether they could perceive any Stars in\r\nit: which they did; and, being returned to her Majesty, reported that\r\nthey had seen three Blazing-Stars appear there, one after another in a\r\nshort time, whereof two were bright, and one dim; but they could not\r\nagree neither in this observation: for some said, It was but one Star\r\nwhich appeared at three several times, in several places; and others\r\nwould have them to be three several Stars; for they thought it\r\nimpossible, that those three several appearances should have been but\r\none Star, because every Star did rise at a certain time, and appear'd in\r\na certain place, and did disappear in the same place: Next, It is\r\naltogether improbable, said they, That one Star should fly from place to\r\nplace, especially at such a vast distance, without a visible motion; in\r\nso short a time, and appear in such different places, whereof two were\r\nquite opposite, and the third side-ways: Lastly, If it had been but one\r\nStar, said they, it would always have kept the same splendor, which it\r\ndid not; for, as above mentioned, two were bright, and one was dim.\r\nAfter they had thus argued, the Empress began to grow angry at their\r\nTelescopes, that they could give no better Intelligence; for, said she,\r\nnow I do plainly perceive, that your Glasses are false Informers, and\r\ninstead of discovering the Truth, delude your Senses; Wherefore I\r\nCommand you to break them, and let the Bird-men trust onely to their\r\nnatural eyes, and examine Cœlestial Objects by the motions of their own\r\nSense and Reason. The Bear-men replied, That it was not the fault of\r\ntheir Glasses, which caused such differences in their Opinions, but the\r\nsensitive motions in their Optick organs did not move alike, nor were\r\ntheir rational judgments always regular: To which the Empress answered,\r\nThat if their Glasses were true Informers, they would rectifie their\r\nirregular Sense and Reason; But, said she, Nature has made your Sense\r\nand Reason more regular then Art has your Glasses; for they are meer\r\ndeluders, and will never lead you to the knowledg of Truth; Wherefore I\r\ncommand you again to break them; for you may observe the progressive\r\nmotions of Cœlestial Bodies with your natural eyes better then through\r\nArtificial Glasses. The Bear-men being exceedingly troubled at her\r\nMajesties displeasure concerning their Telescopes, kneel'd down, and in\r\nthe humblest manner petitioned, that they might not be broken; for, said\r\nthey, we take more delight in Artificial delusions, then in Natural\r\ntruths. Besides, we shall want Imployments for our Senses, and Subjects\r\nfor Arguments; for, were there nothing but truth, and no falshood, there\r\nwould be no occasion to dispute, and by this means we should want the\r\naim and pleasure of our endeavors in confuting and contradicting each\r\nother; neither would one man be thought wiser then another, but all\r\nwould either be alike knowing and wise, or all would be fools; wherefore\r\nwe most humbly beseech your Imperial Majesty to spare our Glasses, which\r\nare our onely delight, and as dear to us as our lives. The Empress at\r\nlast consented to their request, but upon condition, that their disputes\r\nand quarrels should remain within their Schools, and cause no factions\r\nor disturbances in State, or Government. The Bear-men, full of joy,\r\nreturned their most humble thanks to the Empress; and to make her amends\r\nfor the displeasure which their Telescopes had occasioned, told her\r\nMajesty, that they had several other artificial Optick-Glasses, which\r\nthey were sure would give her Majesty a great deal more satisfaction.\r\nAmongst the rest, they brought forth several Microscopes, by the means\r\nof which they could enlarge the shapes of little bodies, and make a\r\nLowse appear as big as an Elephant, and a Mite as big as a Whale. First\r\nof all they shewed the Empress a gray Drone-flye, wherein they observed\r\nthat the greatest part of her face, nay, of her head, consisted of two\r\nlarge bunches all cover'd over with a multitude of small Pearls or\r\nHemispheres in a Trigonal order: Which Pearls were of two degrees,\r\nsmaller and bigger; the smaller degree was lowermost, and looked towards\r\nthe ground; the other was upward, and looked sideward, forward and\r\nbackward: They were all so smooth and polished, that they were able to\r\nrepresent the image of any object, the number of them was in all 14000.\r\nAfter the view of this strange and miraculous Creature, and their\r\nseveral observations upon it, the Empress asked them, What they judged\r\nthose little Hemispheres might be? They answered, That each of them was\r\na perfect Eye, by reason they perceived that each was covered with a\r\nTransparent Cornea, containing a liquor within them, which resembled the\r\nwatery or glassie humor of the Eye. To which the Emperess replied, That\r\nthey might be glassie Pearls, and yet not Eyes; and that perhaps their\r\nMicroscopes did not truly inform them. But they smilingly answered her\r\nMajesty, That she did not know the vertue of those Microscopes: for they\r\nnever delude, but rectifie and inform the Senses; nay, the World, said\r\nthey, would be but blind without them, as it has been in former ages\r\nbefore those Microscopes were invented.\r\n\r\nAfter this, they took a Charcoal, and viewing it with one of their best\r\nMicroscopes, discovered in it an infinite multitude of pores, some\r\nbigger, some less; so close and thick, that they left but very little\r\nspace betwixt them to be filled with a solid body; and to give her\r\nImperial Majesty a better assurance thereof, they counted in a line of\r\nthem an inch long, no less then 2700 pores; from which Observation they\r\ndrew this following Conclusion, to wit, That this multitude of pores was\r\nthe cause of the blackness of the Coal; for, said they, a body that has\r\nso many pores, from each of which no light is reflected, must\r\nnecessarily look black, since black is nothing else but a privation of\r\nlight, or a want of reflection. But the Empress replied, That if all\r\nColours were made by reflection of light, and that Black was as much a\r\ncolour as any other colour; then certainly they contradicted themselves\r\nin saying that black was made by want of reflection. However, not to\r\ninterrupt your Microscopical Inspections, said she, let us see how\r\nVegetables appear through your Glasses; whereupon they took a Nettle,\r\nand by the vertue of the Microscope, discovered that underneath the\r\npoints of the Nettle there were certain little bags or bladders,\r\ncontaining a poysonous liquor, and when the points had made way into the\r\ninterior parts of the skin, they like Syringe-pipes served to conveigh\r\nthat same liquor into them. To which Observation the Empress replied,\r\nThat if there were such poyson in Nettles, then certainly in eating of\r\nthem, they would hurt us inwardly, as much as they do outwardly? But\r\nthey answered, That it belonged to Physicians more then to Experimental\r\nPhilosophers, to give Reasons hereof; for they only made Microscopical\r\ninspections, and related the Figures of the Natural parts of Creatures\r\naccording to the representation of their glasses.\r\n\r\nLastly, They shewed the Empress a Flea, and a Lowse; which Creatures\r\nthrough the Microscope appear'd so terrible to her sight, that they had\r\nalmost put her into a swoon; the description of all their parts would be\r\nvery tedious to relate, and therefore I'le forbear it at this present.\r\nThe Empress, after the view of those strangely-shaped Creatures, pitied\r\nmuch those that are molested with them, especially poor Beggars, which\r\nalthough they have nothing to live on themselves, are yet necessitated\r\nto maintain and feed of their own flesh and blood, a company of such\r\nterrible Creatures called Lice; who, instead of thanks, do reward them\r\nwith pains, and torment them for giving them nourishment and food. But\r\nafter the Empress had seen the shapes of these monstrous Creatures, she\r\ndesir'd to know, Whether their Microscopes could hinder their biting, or\r\nat least shew some means how to avoid them? To which they answered, That\r\nsuch Arts were mechanical and below the noble study of Microscopical\r\nobservations. Then the Empress asked them, Whether they had not such\r\nsorts of Glasses that could enlarge and magnifie the shapes of great\r\nBodies as well as they had done of little ones? Whereupon they took one\r\nof their best and largest Microscopes, and endeavoured to view a Whale\r\nthorow it; but alas! the shape of the Whale was so big, that its\r\nCircumference went beyond the magnifying quality of the Glass; whether\r\nthe error proceeded from the Glass, or from a wrong position of the\r\nWhale against the reflection of light, I cannot certainly tell. The\r\nEmpress seeing the insufficiency of those Magnifying-Glasses, that they\r\nwere not able to enlarge all sorts of Objects, asked the Bear-men,\r\nwhether they could not make Glasses of a contrary nature to those they\r\nhad shewed her, to wit, such as instead of enlarging or magnifying the\r\nshape or figure of an Object, could contract it beneath its natural\r\nproportion: Which, in obedience to her Majesties Commands, they did; and\r\nviewing through one of the best of them, a huge and mighty Whale\r\nappear'd no bigger then a Sprat; nay, through some no bigger then a\r\nVinegar-Eele; and through their ordinary ones, an Elephant seemed no\r\nbigger then a Flea; a Camel no bigger then a Lowse; and an Ostrich no\r\nbigger then a Mite. To relate all their Optick observations through the\r\nseveral sorts of their Glasses, would be a tedious work, and tire even\r\nthe most patient Reader, wherefore I'le pass them by; onely this was\r\nvery remarkable and worthy to be taken notice of, that notwithstanding\r\ntheir great skil, industry and ingenuity in Experimental Philosophy,\r\nthey could yet by no means contrive such Glasses, by the help of which\r\nthey could spy out a Vacuum, with all its dimensions, nor Immaterial\r\nsubstances, Non-beings, and Mixt-beings, or such as are between\r\nsomething and nothing; which they were very much troubled at, hoping\r\nthat yet, in time, by long study and practice, they might perhaps attain\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThe Bird- and Bear-men being dismissed, the Empress called both the\r\nSyrens- or Fish-men, and the Worm-men, to deliver their Observations\r\nwhich they had made, both within the Seas, and the Earth. First, she\r\nenquired of the Fish-men whence the saltness of the Sea did proceed? To\r\nwhich they answered, That there was a volatile salt in those parts of\r\nthe Earth, which as a bosom contain the Waters of the Sea, which Salt\r\nbeing imbibed by the Sea, became fixt; and this imbibing motion was that\r\nthey call'd the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea; for, said they, the\r\nrising and swelling of the Water, is caused by those parts of the\r\nvolatile Salt as are not so easily imbibed, which striving to ascend\r\nabove the Water, bear it up with such a motion, as Man, or some other\r\nAnimal Creature, in a violent exercise uses to take breath. This they\r\naffirmed to be the true cause both of the saltness, and the ebbing and\r\nflowing-motion of the Sea, and not the jogging of the Earth, or the\r\nsecret influence of the Moon, as some others had made the World believe.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the Empress enquired, Whether they had observed, that all\r\nAnimal Creatures within the Seas and other waters, had blood? They\r\nanswered, That some had blood, more or less, but some had none. In\r\nCrea-fishes and Lobsters, said they, we perceive but little blood; but\r\nin Crabs, Oysters, Cockles, &c. none at all. Then the Empress asked\r\nthem, in what part of their Bodies that little blood did reside? They\r\nanswered, in a small vein, which in Lobsters went through the middle of\r\ntheir tails, but in Crea-fishes was found in their backs: as for other\r\nsorts of Fishes, some, said they, had onely blood about their Gills, and\r\nothers in some other places of their Bodies; but they had not as yet\r\nobserved any whose veins did spread all over their Bodies. The Empress\r\nwondring that there could be living Animals without Blood, to be better\r\nsatisfied, desired the Worm-men to inform her, whether they had observed\r\nBlood in all sorts of Worms? They answered, That, as much as they could\r\nperceive, some had Blood, and some not; a Moth, said they, had no Blood\r\nat all, and a Lowse had, but like a Lobster, a little Vein along her\r\nback: Also Nits, Snails, and Maggots, as well as those that are\r\ngenerated out of Cheese and Fruits, as those that are produced out of\r\nFlesh, had no blood: But, replied the Empress, If those mentioned\r\ncreatures have no blood, how is it possible they can live? for it is\r\ncommonly said, That the life of an Animal consists in the blood, which\r\nis the seat of the Animal spirits. They answered, That blood was not a\r\nnecessary propriety to the life of an Animal; and that that which was\r\ncommonly called Animal spirits, was nothing else but corporeal motions\r\nproper to the nature and figure of an Animal. Then she asked both the\r\nFish- and Worm-men, whether all those Creatures that have blood, had a\r\ncirculation of blood in their veins and arteries? But they answered,\r\nThat it was impossible to give her Majesty an exact account thereof, by\r\nreason the circulation of blood was an interior motion, which their\r\nsenses, neither of themselves, nor by the help of any Optick Instrument\r\ncould perceive; but as soon as they had dissected an Animal Creature, to\r\nfind out the truth thereof, the interior corporeal motions proper to\r\nthat particular figure or creature, were altered. Then said the Empress,\r\nIf all Animal Creatures have not blood, it is certain, they all have\r\nneither Muscles, tendons, nerves, &c. But, said she, Have you ever\r\nobserved Animal Creatures that are neither flesh, nor Fish, but of an\r\nintermediate degree between both? Truly, answered both the Fish- and\r\nWorm-men, We have observed several Animal Creatures that live both in\r\nWater, and on the Earth, indifferently, and if any, certainly those may\r\nbe said to be of such a mixt nature, that is, partly Flesh, and partly\r\nFish: But how is it possible, replied the Empress, that they should live\r\nboth in Water, and on the Earth, since those Animals that live by the\r\nrespiration of Air, cannot live within Water; and those that live in\r\nWater, cannot live by the respiration of Air, as Experience doth\r\nsufficiently witness. They answered her Majesty, That as there were\r\ndifferent sorts of Creatures, so they had also different ways of\r\nRespirations; for Respiration, said they, is nothing else but a\r\ncomposition and division of parts, and the motions of nature being\r\ninfinitely various, it is impossible that all Creatures should have the\r\nlike motions; wherefore it was not necessary, that all Animal Creatures\r\nshould be bound to live either by the Air, or by Water onely, but\r\naccording as Nature had ordered it convenient to their Species. The\r\nEmpress seem'd very well satisfied with their answer, and desired to be\r\nfurther informed, Whether all Animal Creatures did continue their\r\nSpecies by a successive propogation of particulars, and whether in every\r\nSpecies the off-springs did always resemble their Generator or Producer,\r\nboth in their interior and exterior Figures? They answered, her Majesty,\r\nThat some Species or sorts of Creatures, were kept up by a successive\r\npropagation of an off-spring that was like the producer, but some were\r\nnot. Of the first rank, said they, are all those Animals that are of\r\ndifferent sexes, besides several others; but of the second rank are for\r\nthe most part those we call Insects, whose production proceds from such\r\ncauses as have no conformity or likeness with their produced Effects; as\r\nfor example, Maggots bred out of Cheese, and several others generated\r\nout of Earth, Water, and the like. But said the Empress, there is some\r\nlikeness between Maggots and Cheese; for Cheese has no blood, nor\r\nMaggots neither; besides, they have almost the same taste which Cheese\r\nhas. This proves nothing, answered they; for Maggots have a visible,\r\nlocal, progressive motion, which Cheese hath not. The Empress replied,\r\nThat when all the Cheese was turned into Maggots, it might be said to\r\nhave local, progressive motion. They answered, That when the Cheese by\r\nits own figurative motions was changed into Maggots, it was no more\r\nCheese. The Empress confessed that she observed Nature was infinitely\r\nvarious in her works, and that though the species of Creatures did\r\ncontinue, yet their particulars were subject to infinite changes. But\r\nsince you have informed me, said she, of the various sorts and\r\nproductions of Animal Creatures, I desire you to tell me what you have\r\nobserved of their sensitive perceptions? Truly, answered they, Your\r\nMajesty puts a very hard question to us, and we shall hardly be able to\r\ngive a satisfactory answer to it; for there are many different sorts of\r\nCreatures, which as they have all different perceptions, so they have\r\nalso different organs, which our senses are not able to discover, onely\r\nin an Oystershell we have with admiration observed, that the common\r\nsensorium of the Oyster lies just as the closing of the shells, where\r\nthe pressure and re-action may be perceived by the opening and shutting\r\nof the shells every tide.\r\n\r\nAfter all this, the Empress desired the Worm men to give her a true\r\nRelation how frost was made upon the Earth? To which they answered, That\r\nit was made much after the manner and description of the Fish- and\r\nBird-men, concerning the Congelation of Water into Ice and Snow, by a\r\ncommixture of saline and acid particles; which relation added a great\r\nlight to the Ape-men, who were the Chymists, concerning their Chymical\r\nprinciples, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury. But, said the Empress, if it be\r\nso, it will require an infinite multitude of saline particles to produce\r\nsuch a great quantity of Ice, Frost and Snow: besides, said she, when\r\nSnow, Ice and Frost, turn again into their former principle, I would\r\nfain know what becomes of those saline particles? But neither the\r\nWorm-men, nor the Fish- and Bird-men, could give her an answer to it.\r\n\r\nThen the Empress enquired of them the reason, Why Springs were not as\r\nsalt as the Sea is? also, why some did ebb and flow? To which it was\r\nanswered, That the ebbing and flowing of some Springs, was caused by\r\nhollow Caverns within the Earth, where the Seawater crowding thorow, did\r\nthrust forward, and drew backward the Spring-water, according to its own\r\nway of ebbing and flowing; but others said, That it proceeded from a\r\nsmall proportion of saline and acid particles, which the Spring-water\r\nimbibed from the Earth; and although it was not so much as to be\r\nperceived by the sense of Taste; yet it was enough to cause an ebbing\r\nand flowing-motion. And as for the Spring- water being fresh, they gave,\r\naccording to their Observation, this following reason: There is, said\r\nthey, a certain heat within the Bowels of the Earth, proceeding from its\r\nswift circular motion, upon its own axe, which heat distills the rarest\r\nparts of the Earth into a fresh and insipid water, which water being\r\nthrough the pores of the Earth, conveighed into a place where it may\r\nbreak forth without resistance or obstruction, causes Springs and\r\nFountains; and these distilled Waters within the Earth, do nourish and\r\nrefresh the grosser and drier parts thereof. This Relation confirmed the\r\nEmpress in the opinion concerning the motion of the Earth, and the\r\nfixedness of the Sun, as the Bird-men had informed her; and then she\r\nasked the Worm-men, whether Minerals and Vegetables were generated by\r\nthe same heat that is within the Bowels of the Earth? To which they\r\ncould give her no positive answer; onely this they affirmed, That heat\r\nand cold were not the primary producing causes of either Vegetables or\r\nMinerals, or other sorts of Creatures, but onely effects; and to prove\r\nthis our assertion, said they, we have observed, that by change of some\r\nsorts of Corporeal motions, that which is now hot, will become cold; and\r\nwhat is now cold, will grow hot; but the hottest place of all, we find\r\nto be the Center of the Earth: Neither do we observe, that the Torrid\r\nZone does contain so much Gold and Silver as the Temperate; nor is there\r\ngreat store of Iron and Lead wheresoever there is Gold; for these Metals\r\nare most found in colder Climates towards either of the Poles. This\r\nObservation, the Empress commanded them to confer with her Chymists, the\r\nApe-men; to let them know that Gold was not produced by a violent, but a\r\ntemperate degree of heat. She asked further, Whether Gold could not be\r\nmade by Art? They answered, That they could not certainly tell her\r\nMajesty, but if it was possible to be done, they thought Tin, Lead,\r\nBrass, Iron and Silver, to be the fittest Metals for such an Artificial\r\nTransmutation. Then she asked them, Whether Art could produce Iron, Tin,\r\nLead, or Silver? They answered, Not, in their opinion. Then I perceive,\r\nreplyed the Empress, that your judgments are very irregular, since you\r\nbelieve that Gold, which is so fixt a Metal, that nothing has been found\r\nas yet which could occasion a dissolution of its interior figure, may be\r\nmade by Art, and not Tin, Lead, Iron, Copper or Silver, which yet are so\r\nfar weaker, and meaner Metals then Gold is. But the Worm-men excused\r\nthemselves, that they were ignorant in that Art, and that such questions\r\nbelonged more properly to the Ape-men, which were Her Majesties Chymists.\r\n\r\nThen the Empress asked them, Whether by their Sensitive perceptions they\r\ncould observe the interior corporeal, figurative Motions both of\r\nVegetables and Minerals? They answer'd, That their Senses could perceive\r\nthem after they were produced, but not before; Nevertheless, said they,\r\nalthough the interior, figurative motions of Natural Creatures are not\r\nsubject to the exterior, animal, sensitive perceptions, yet by their\r\nRational perception they may judg of them, and of their productions if\r\nthey be regular: Whereupon the Empress commanded the Bear-men to lend\r\nthem some of their best Microscopes. At which the Bear- men smilingly\r\nanswered her Majesty, that their Glasses would do them but little\r\nservice in the bowels of the Earth, because there was no light; for,\r\nsaid they, our Glasses do onely represent exterior objects, according to\r\nthe various reflections and positions of light; and wheresoever light is\r\nwanting, the glasses wil do no good. To which the Worm-men replied, that\r\nalthough they could not say much of refractions, reflections,\r\ninflections, and the like; yet were they not blind, even in the bowels\r\nof the Earth: for they could see the several sorts of Minerals, as also\r\nminute Animals, that lived there; which minute Animal Creatures were not\r\nblind neither, but had some kind of sensitive perception that was as\r\nserviceable to them, as sight, taste, smell, touch, hearing, &c. was to\r\nother Animal Creatures: By which it is evident, That Nature has been as\r\nbountiful to those Creatures that live underground, or in the bowels of\r\nthe Earth, as to those that live upon the surface of the Earth, or in\r\nthe Air, or in Water. But howsoever, proceeded the Worm-men, although\r\nthere is light in the bowels of the Earth, yet your Microscopes will do\r\nbut little good there, by reason those Creatures that live under ground\r\nhave not such an optick sense as those that live on the surface of the\r\nEarth: wherefore, unless you had such Glasses as are proper for their\r\nperception, your Microscopes will not be any ways advantagious to them.\r\nThe Empress seem'd well pleased with this answer of the Worm-men; and\r\nasked them further, Whether Minerals and all other Creatures within the\r\nEarth were colourless? At which question they could not forbear\r\nlaughing; and when the Empress asked the reason why they laught? We most\r\nhumbly beg your Majesties pardon, replied they; for we could not chuse\r\nbut laugh, when we heard of a colourless Body. Why, said the Empress,\r\nColour is onely an accident, which is an immaterial thing, and has no\r\nbeing of it self, but in another body. Those, replied they, that\r\ninformed your Majesty thus, surely their rational motions were very\r\nirregular; For how is it possible, that a Natural nothing can have a\r\nbeing in Nature? If it be no substance, it cannot have a being, and if\r\nno being, it is nothing; Wherefore the distinction between subsisting of\r\nit self, and subsisting in another body, is a meer nicety, and\r\nnon-sense, for there is nothing in Nature that can subsist of, or by it\r\nself, (I mean singly) by reason all parts of Nature are composed in one\r\nbody, and though they may be infinitely divided, commixed, and changed\r\nin their particular, yet in general, parts cannot be separated from\r\nparts as long as Nature lasts; nay, we might as probably affirm, that\r\nInfinite Nature would be as soon destroyed, as that one Atom could\r\nperish; and therefore your Majesty may firmly believe, that there is no\r\nBody without colour, nor no Colour without body; for colour, figure,\r\nplace, magnitude, and body, are all but one thing, without any\r\nseparation or abstraction from each other.\r\n\r\nThe Empress was so wonderfully taken with this Discourse of the\r\nWorm-men, that she not only pardoned the rudeness they committed in\r\nlaughing at first at her question, but yielded a full assent to their\r\nopinion, which she thought the most rational that ever she had heard\r\nyet; and then proceeding in her questions, enquired further, whether\r\nthey had observed any seminal principles within the Earth free from all\r\ndimensions and qualities, which produced Vegetables, Minerals, and the\r\nlike? To which they answered, That concerning the seeds of Minerals,\r\ntheir sensitive perceptions had never observed any; but Vegetables had\r\ncertain seeds out of which they were produced. Then she asked, whether\r\nthose seeds of Vegetables lost their Species, that is, were annihilated\r\nin the production of their off-spring? To which they answered, That by\r\nan Annihilation, nothing could be produced, and that the seeds of\r\nVegetables were so far from being annihilated in their productions, that\r\nthey did rather numerously increase and multiply; for the division of\r\none seed, said they, does produce numbers of seeds out of it self. But\r\nrepli'd the Empress, A particular part cannot increase of it self. 'Tis\r\ntrue, answer'd they: but they increase not barely of themselves, but by\r\njoining and commixing with other parts, which do assist them in their\r\nproductions, and by way of imitation form or figure their own parts into\r\nsuch or such particulars. Then, I pray inform me, said the Empress, what\r\ndisguise those seeds put on, and how they do conceal themselves in their\r\nTransmutations? They answered, That seeds did no ways disguise or\r\nconceal, but rather divulge themselves in the multiplication of their\r\noff-spring; onely they did hide and conceal themselves from their\r\nsensitive perceptions so, that their figurative and productive motions\r\nwere not perceptible by Animal Creatures. Again, the Empress asked them,\r\nwhether there were any Non-beings within the Earth? To which they\r\nanswered, That they never heard of any such thing; and that, if her\r\nMajesty would know the truth thereof, she must ask those Creatures that\r\nare called Immaterial spirits, which had a great affinity with\r\nNon-beings, and perhaps could give her a satisfactory answer to this\r\nquestion. Then she desired to be informed, What opinion they had of the\r\nbeginning of Forms? They told her Majesty, That they did not understand\r\nwhat she meant by this expression; For, said they, there is no beginning\r\nin Nature, no not of Particulars; by reason Nature is Eternal and\r\nInfinite, and her particulars are subject to infinite changes and\r\ntransmutations by vertue of their own Corporeal, figurative\r\nself-motions; so that there's nothing new in Nature, not properly a\r\nbeginning of any thing. The Empress seem'd well satisfied with all those\r\nanswers, and enquired further, Whether there was no Art used by those\r\nCreatures that live within the Earth? Yes, answered they: for the\r\nseveral parts of the Earth do join and assist each other in composition\r\nor framing of such or such particulars; and many times, there are\r\nfactions and divisions; which cause productions of mixt Species; as, for\r\nexample, weeds, instead of sweet flowres and useful fruits; but\r\nGardeners and Husbandmen use often to decide their quarrels, and cause\r\nthem to agree; which though it shews a kindness to the differing parties,\r\nyet 'tis a great prejudice to the Worms, and other Animal-Creatures\r\nthat live under ground; for it most commonly causes their dissolution\r\nand ruine, at best they are driven out of their habitations. What, said\r\nthe Empress, are not Worms produced out of the Earth? Their production\r\nin general, answered they, is like the production of all other Natural\r\nCreatures, proceeding from the corporeal figurative motions of Nature;\r\nbut as for their particular productions, they are according to the\r\nnature of their Species; some are produced out of flowers, some out\r\nof roots, some out of fruits, some out of ordinary Earth. Then they\r\nare very ungrateful Children, replied the Empress, that they feed on\r\ntheir own Parents which gave them life. Their life, answered they, is\r\ntheir own, and not their Parents; for no part or creature of Nature can\r\neither give or take away life; but parts do onely assist and join with\r\nparts, either in dissolution or production of other Parts and Creatures.\r\n\r\nAfter this, and several other Conferences, which the Empress held with\r\nthe Worm-men, she dismissed them; and having taken much satisfaction in\r\nseveral of their Answers, encouraged them in their Studies and\r\nObservations. Then she made a Convocation of her Chymists, the Ape-men;\r\nand commanded them to give her an account of the several Transmutations\r\nwhich their Art was able to produce. They begun first with a long and\r\ntedious Discourse concerning the Primitive Ingredients of Natural\r\nbodies; and how, by their Art, they had found out the principles out of\r\nwhich they consist. But they did not all agree in their opinions; for\r\nsome said, That the Principles of all Natural Bodies were the four\r\nElements, Fire, Air, Water, Earth, out of which they were composed:\r\nOthers rejected this Elementary commixture, and said, There were many\r\nBodies out of which none of the four Elements could be extracted by any\r\ndegree of Fire whatsoever; and that, on the other side, there were\r\ndivers Bodies, whose resolution by Fire reduced them into more then four\r\ndifferent Ingredients; and these affirmed, That the only principles of\r\nNatural Bodies were Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury: Others again declared,\r\nThat none of the forementioned could be called the True Principles of\r\nNatural Bodies; but that by their industry and pains which they had\r\ntaken in the Art of Chymistry, they had discovered, that all Natural\r\nBodies were produced but from one Principle, which was Water; for all\r\nVegetables, Minerals, and Animals, said they, are nothing else, but\r\nsimple Water distinguished into various figures by the vertue of their\r\nSeeds. But after a great many debates and contentions about this\r\nSubject, the Empress being so much tired that she was not able to hear\r\nthem any longer, imposed a general silence upon them, and then declared\r\nher self in this following Discourse.\r\n\r\nI am too sensible of the pains you have taken in the Art of Chymistry,\r\nto discover the Principles of Natural Bodies, and wish they had been\r\nmore profitably bestowed upon some other, then such experiments; for\r\nboth by my own Contemplation, and the Observations which I have made by\r\nmy rational & sensitive perception upon Nature, and her works, I find,\r\nthat Nature is but one Infinite Self-moving Body, which by the vertue of\r\nits self-motion, is divided into Infinite parts, which parts being\r\nrestless, undergo perpetual changes and transmutations by their infinite\r\ncompositions and divisions. Now, if this be so, as surely, according to\r\nregular Sense and Reason, it appears no otherwise; it is in vain to look\r\nfor primary Ingredients, or constitutive principles of Natural Bodies,\r\nsince there is no more but one Universal Principle of Nature, to wit,\r\nself-moving Matter, which is the onely cause of all natural effects.\r\nNext, I desire you to consider, that Fire is but a particular Creature,\r\nor effect of Nature, and occasions not onely different effects in\r\nseveral Bodies, but on some Bodies has no power at all; witness Gold,\r\nwhich never could be brought yet to change its interior figure by the\r\nart of Fire; and if this be so, Why should you be so simple as to\r\nbelieve that Fire can shew you the Principles of Nature? and that either\r\nthe Four Elements, or Water onely, or Salt Sulphur and Mercury, all\r\nwhich are no more but particular effects and Creatures of Nature, should\r\nbe the Primitive Ingredients or Principles of all Natural Bodies?\r\nWherefore, I will not have you to take more pains, and waste your time\r\nin such fruitless attempts, but be wiser hereafter, and busie your\r\nselves with such Experiments as may be beneficial to the publick.\r\n\r\nThe Empress having thus declared her mind to the Ape-men, and given them\r\nbetter Instructions then perhaps they expected, not knowing that her\r\nMajesty had such great and able judgment in Natural Philosophy, had\r\nseveral conferences with them concerning Chymical Preperations, which\r\nfor brevities sake, I'le forbear to reherse: Amongst the rest, she\r\nasked, how it came that the Imperial Race appear'd so young, and yet was\r\nreported to have lived so long; some of them two, some three, and some\r\nfour hundred years? and whether it was by Nature, or a special Divine\r\nblessing? To which they answered, That there was a certain Rock in the\r\nparts of that World, which contained the Golden Sands, which Rock was\r\nhallow within, and did produce a Gum that was a hundred years before it\r\ncame to its full strength and perfection; this Gum, said they, if it be\r\nheld in a warm hand, will dissolve into an Oyl, the effects whereof are\r\nfollowing: It being given every day for some certain time, to an old\r\ndecayed man, in the bigness of a little Pea, will first make him spit\r\nfor a week, or more; after this, it will cause Vomits of Flegm; and\r\nafter that it will bring forth by vomits, humors of several colours;\r\nfirst of a pale yellow, then of a deep yellow, then of a green, and\r\nlastly of a black colour; and each of these humours have a several\r\ntaste, some are fresh, some salt, some sower, some bitter, and so forth;\r\nneither do all these Vomits make them sick, but they come out on a\r\nsudden, and unawares, without any pain or trouble to the patient: And\r\nafter it hath done all these mentioned effects, and clear'd both the\r\nStomack and several other parts of the body, then it works upon the\r\nBrain, and brings forth of the Nose such kinds of humors as it did out\r\nof the Mouth, and much after the same manner; then it will purge by\r\nstool, then by urine, then by sweat, and lastly by bleeding at the Nose,\r\nand the Emeroids; all which effects it will perform within the space of\r\nsix weeks, or a little more; for it does not work very strongly, but\r\ngently, and by degrees: Lastly, when it has done all this, it will make\r\nthe body break out into a thick Scab, and cause both Hair, Teeth, and\r\nNails to come off; which scab being arrived to its full maturity, opens\r\nfirst along the back, and comes off all in a piece like armour, and all\r\nthis is done within the space of four months. After this the Patient is\r\nwrapt into a Cere-cloth, prepared of certain Gums and Juices, wherein\r\nhe continues until the time of nine Months be expired from the first\r\nbeginning of the cure, which is the time of a Childs formation in the\r\nWomb. In the mean while, his diet is nothing else but Eagles-eggs, and\r\nHinds-milk; and after the Cere-cloth is taken away, he will appear of\r\nthe age of Twenty, both in shape, and strength. The weaker sort of this\r\nGum is soveraign in healing of wounds, and curing of slight distempers.\r\nBut this is also to be observed, that none of the Imperial race does use\r\nany other drink but Lime-water, or water in which Lime-stone is\r\nimmerged; their meat is nothing else but Fowl of several sorts, their\r\nrecreations are many, but chiefly Hunting.\r\n\r\nThis Relation amazed the Empress very much; for though in the World she\r\ncame from, she had heard great reports of the Philosophers-stone, yet\r\nhad she not heard of any that had ever found it out, which made her\r\nbelieve that it was but a Chymera; she called also to mind, that there\r\nhad been in the same World a Man who had a little Stone which cured all\r\nkinds of Diseases outward and inward, according it was applied; and that\r\na famous Chymist had found out a certain Liquor called Alkahest, which\r\nby the vertue of its own fire, consumed all Diseases; but she had never\r\nheard of a Medicine that could renew old Age, and render it beautiful,\r\nvigorous and strong: Nor would she have so easily believed it, had it\r\nbeen a medicine prepared by Art; for she knew that Art, being Natures\r\nChangeling, was not able to produce such a powerful effect; but being\r\nthat the Gum did grow naturally, she did not so much scruple at it; for\r\nshe knew that Nature's Works are so various and wonderful, that no\r\nparticular Creature is able to trace her ways.\r\n\r\nThe Conferences of the Chymists being finished, the Empress made an\r\nAssembly of her Galenical Physicians, her Herbalists and Anatomists; and\r\nfirst she enquired of her Herbalists the particular effects of several\r\nHerbs and Drugs, and whence they proceeded? To which they answered, that\r\nthey could, for the most part, tell her Majesty the vertues and\r\noperations of them, but the particular causes of their effects were\r\nunknown; onely thus much they could say, that their operations and\r\nvertues were generally caused by their proper inherent, corporeal,\r\nfigurative motions, which being infinitely various in Infinite Nature,\r\ndid produce infinite several effects. And it is observed, said they,\r\nthat Herbs and Drugs are as wise in their operations, as Men in their\r\nwords and actions; nay, wiser; and their effects are more certain then\r\nMen in their opinions; for though they cannot discourse like Men, yet\r\nhave they Sense and Reason, as well as Men; for the discursive faculty\r\nis but a particular effect of Sense and Reason in some particular\r\nCreatures, to wit, Men, and not a principle of Nature, and argues often\r\nmore folly then wisdom. The Empress asked, Whether they could not by a\r\ncomposition and commixture of other Drugs make them work other effects\r\nthen they did, used by themselves? They answered, That they could make\r\nthem produce artificial effects, but not alter their inherent, proper\r\nand particular natures.\r\n\r\nThen the Empress commanded her Anatomists to dissect such kinds of\r\nCreatures as are called Monsters. But they answered her Majesty, That it\r\nwould be but an unprofitable and useless work, and hinder their better\r\nimployments; for when we dissect dead Animals, said they, it is for no\r\nother end, but to observe what defects and distempers they had, that we\r\nmay cure the like in living ones, so that all our care and industry\r\nconcerns onely the preservation of Mankind; but we hope your Majesty\r\nwill not preserve Monsters, which are most commonly destroyed, except it\r\nbe for novelty: Neither will the dissection of Monsters prevent the\r\nerrors of Nature's irregular actions; for by dissecting some, we cannot\r\nprevent the production of others; so that our pains and labour will be\r\nto no purpose, unless to satisfie the vain curiosities of inquisitive\r\nmen. The Empress replied, That such dissections would be very beneficial\r\nto Experimental Philosophers. If Experimental Philosophers, answer'd\r\nthey, do spend their time in such useless Inspections, they waste it in\r\nvain, and have nothing but their labour for their pains.\r\n\r\nLastly, her Majesty had some Conferences with the Galenick Physicians\r\nabout several Diseases, and amongst the rest, desired to know the cause\r\nand nature of Apoplexies, and the spotted Plague. They answered, That a\r\ndeadly Apoplexy was a dead palsie of the Brain, and the spotted Plague\r\nwas a Gangrene of the Vital parts: and as the Gangrene of outward parts\r\ndid strike inwardly; so the Gangrene of inward parts, did break forth\r\noutwardly: which is the cause, said they, that as soon as the spots\r\nappear, death follows; for then it is an infallible sign, that the body\r\nis throughout infected with a Gangrene, which is a spreading evil; but\r\nsome Gangrenes do spread more suddenly than others, and of all sorts of\r\nGangrenes, the Plaguy- Gangrene is the most infectious; for other\r\nGangrenes infect but the next adjoining parts of one particular body,\r\nand having killed that same Creature, go no further, but cease; when as,\r\nthe Gangrene of the Plague, infects not onely the adjoining parts of one\r\nparticular Creature, but also those that are distant; that is, one\r\nparticular body infects another, and so breeds a Universal Contagion.\r\nBut the Empress being very desirous to know in what manner the Plague\r\nwas propagated, and became so contagious, asked, Whether it went\r\nactually out of one body into another? To which they answered, That it\r\nwas a great dispute amongst the Learned of their Profession, Whether it\r\ncame by a division and composition of parts; that is, by expiration and\r\ninspiration; or whether it was caused by imitation: some Experimental\r\nPhilosophers, said they, will make us believe, that by the help of their\r\nMicroscopes, they have observed the Plague to be a body of little Flies\r\nlike Atoms, which go out of one body into another, through the sensitive\r\npassages; but the most experienced and wisest of our society, have\r\nrejected this opinion as a ridiculous fancy, and do, for the most part,\r\nbelieve, that it is caused by an imitation of Parts; so that the motions\r\nof some parts which are sound, do imitate the motions of those that are\r\ninfected and that by this means, the Plague becomes contagions, and\r\nspreading.\r\n\r\nThe Empress having hitherto spent her time in the Examination of the\r\nBird- Fish- Worm- and Ape- men, &c. and received several Intelligences\r\nfrom their several imployments; at last had a mind to divert her self\r\nafter her serious Discourses, and therefore she sent for the Spider-men,\r\nwhich were her Mathematicians, the Lice-men which were here\r\nGeometricians, and the Magpie- Parrot- and Jackdaw-men, which were her\r\nOrators and Logicians. The Spider-men came first, and presented her\r\nMajesty with a table full of Mathematical points, lines, and figures of\r\nall sorts, of squares, circles, triangles, and the like; which the\r\nEmpress, notwithstanding that she had a very ready wit, and quick\r\napprehension, could not understand; but the more she endeavoured to\r\nlearn, the more was she confounded: Whether they did ever square the\r\nCircle, I cannot exactly tell, nor whether they could make imaginary\r\npoints and lines; but this I dare say, That their points and lines were\r\nso slender, small and thin, that they seem'd next to Imaginary. The\r\nMathematicians were in great esteem with the Empress, as being not onely\r\nthe chief Tutors and Instructors in many Arts, but some of them\r\nexcellent Magicians and Informers of spirits, which was the reason their\r\nCharacters were so abstruse and intricate, that the Emperess knew not\r\nwhat to make of them. There is so much to learn in your Art, said she,\r\nthat I can neither spare time from other affairs to busie my self in\r\nyour profession; nor, if I could, do I think I should ever be able to\r\nunderstand your Imaginary points, lines and figures, because they are\r\nNon-beings.\r\n\r\nThen came the Lice-men, and endeavoured to measure all things to a\r\nhairs-breadth, and weigh them to an Atom; but their weights would seldom\r\nagree, especially in the weighing of Air, which they found a task\r\nimpossible to be done; at which the Empress began to be displeased, and\r\ntold them, that there was neither Truth nor Justice in their Profession;\r\nand so dissolved their society.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the Empress was resolved to hear the Magpie- Parrot- and\r\nJackdaw-men, which were her professed Orators and Logicians; whereupon\r\none of the Parrot-men rose with great formality, and endeavoured to make\r\nan Eloquent Speech before her Majesty; but before he had half ended, his\r\narguments and divisions being so many, that they caused a great\r\nconfusion in his brain, he could not go forward, but was forced to\r\nretire backward, with great disgrace both to himself, and the whole\r\nsociety; and although one of his brethren endeavoured to second him by\r\nanother speech, yet was he as far to seek, as the former. At which the\r\nEmpress appear'd not a little troubled, and told them, That they\r\nfollowed too much the Rules of Art, and confounded themselves with too\r\nnice formalities and distinctions; but since I know, said she, that you\r\nare a people who have naturally voluble tongues, and good memories; I\r\ndesire you to consider more the subject you speak of, then your\r\nartificial periods, connexions and parts of speech, and leave the rest\r\nto your natural Eloquence; which they did, and so became very eminent\r\nOrators.\r\n\r\nLastly, her Imperial Majesty being desirous to know what progress her\r\nLogicians had made in the Art of disputing, Commanded them to argue upon\r\nseveral Themes or Subjects; which they did; and having made a very nice\r\ndiscourse of Logistical terms and propositions, entred into a dispute by\r\nway of Syllogistical Arguments, through all the Figures and Modes: One\r\nbegan with an Argument of the first Mode of the first Figure, thus:\r\nEvery Politician is wise: Every Knave is a Politician, Therefore every\r\nKnave is wise.\r\n\r\nAnother contradicted him with a Syllogism of the second Mode of the same\r\nFigure, thus: No Politician is wise: Every Knave is a Politician,\r\nTherefore no Knave is wise.\r\n\r\nThe third made an Argument in the third Mode of the same Figure, after\r\nthis manner: Every Politician is wise: some Knaves are Politicians,\r\nTherefore some Knaves are wise.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth concluded with a Syllogism in the fourth Mode of the same\r\nFigure, thus; No Politician is wise: some Knaves are Politicians,\r\nTherefore some Knaves are not wise.\r\n\r\nAfter this they took another subject, and one propounded this Syllogism:\r\nEvery Philosopher is wise: Every Beast is wise, Therefore every Beast is\r\na Philosopher.\r\n\r\nBut another said that this Argument was false, therefore he contradicted\r\nhim with a Syllogism of the second Figure of the fourth Mode, thus:\r\nEvery Philosopher is wise: some Beasts are not wise, Therefore some\r\nBeasts are not Philosophers.\r\n\r\nThus they argued, and intended to go on, but the Empress interrupted\r\nthem: I have enough, said she, of your chopt Logick, and will hear no\r\nmore of your Syllogisms; for it disorders my Reason, and puts my Brain\r\non the rack; your formal argumentations are able to spoil all natural\r\nwit; and I'le have you to consider, that Art does not make Reason, but\r\nReason makes Art; and therefore as much as Reason is above Art, so much\r\nis a natural rational discourse to be preferred before an artificial:\r\nfor Art is, for the most part irregular, and disorders Men's\r\nunderstandings more then it rectifies them, and leads them into a\r\nLabyrinth where they'l never get out, and makes them dull and unfit for\r\nuseful employments; especially your Art of Logick, which consists onely\r\nin contradicting each other, in making sophismes, and obscuring Truth,\r\ninstead of clearing it.\r\n\r\nBut they replied to her Majesty, That the knowledg of Nature, that is,\r\nNatural Philosophy, would be imperfect without the Art of Logick; and\r\nthat there was an improbable Truth which could no otherwise be found out\r\nthen by the Art of disputing. Truly, said the Empress, I do believe that\r\nit is with Natural Philosophy, as it is with all other effects of\r\nNature; for no particular knowledg can be perfect, by reason knowledg is\r\ndividable, as well as composable; nay, to speak properly, Nature her\r\nself cannot boast of any perfection, but God himself; because there are\r\nso many irregular motions in Nature, and 'tis but a folly to think that\r\nArt should be able to regulate them, since Art it self is, for the most\r\npart, irregular. But as for Improbable Truth I know not what your\r\nmeaning is; for Truth is more then Improbability: nay, there is so much\r\ndifference between Truth and Improbability, that I cannot conceive it\r\npossible how they can be joined together. In short, said she, I do no\r\nways approve of your Profession; and though I will not dissolve your\r\nsociety, yet I shall never take delight in hearing you any more;\r\nwherefore confine your disputations to your Schools, lest besides the\r\nCommonwealth of Learning, they disturb also Divinity and Policy,\r\nReligion and Laws, and by that means draw an utter ruine and destruction\r\nboth upon Church and State.\r\n\r\nAfter the Empress had thus finish'd the Discourses and Conferences with\r\nthe mentioned societies of her Vertuoso's, she considered by her self\r\nthe manner of their Religion, and finding it very defective, was\r\ntroubled, that so wise and knowing a people should have no more knowledg\r\nof the Divine Truth; Wherefore she consulted with her own thoughts,\r\nwhether it was possible to convert them all to her own Religion, and to\r\nthat end she resolved to build Churches, and make also up a Congregation\r\nof Women, whereof she intended to be the head her self, and to instruct\r\nthem in the several points of her Religion. This she had no sooner\r\nbegun, but the Women, which generally had quick wits, subtile\r\nconceptions, clear understandings, and solid judgments, became, in a\r\nshort time, very devout and zealous Sisters; for the Empress had an\r\nexcellent gift of Preaching, and instructing them in the Articles of\r\nFaith; and by that means, she converted them not onely soon, but gained\r\nan extraordinary love of all her Subjects throughout that World. But at\r\nlast, pondering with her self the inconstant nature of Mankind, and\r\nfearing that in time they would grow weary, and desert the divine Truth,\r\nfollowing their own fancies, and living according to their own desires;\r\nshe began to be troubled that her labours and pains should prove of so\r\nlittle effect, and therefore studied all manner of ways to prevent it.\r\nAmongst the rest, she call'd to mind a Relation which the Bird-men made\r\nher once, of a Mountain that did burn in flames of fire; and thereupon\r\ndid immediately send for the wisest and subtilest of her Worm-men,\r\ncommanding them to discover the cause of the Eruption of that same fire;\r\nwhich they did; and having dived to the very bottom of the Mountain,\r\ninformed her Majesty, That there was a certain sort of Stone, whose\r\nnature was such, that being wetted, it would grow excessively hot, and\r\nbreak forth into a flaming-fire, until it became dry, and then it ceased\r\nfrom burning. The Empress was glad to hear this news, and forthwith\r\ndesired the Worm men to bring her some of that Stone, but be sure to\r\nkeep it secret: she sent also for the Bird-men, and asked them whether\r\nthey could not get her a piece of the Sun- stone? They answered, That it\r\nwas impossible, unless they did spoil or lessen the light of the World:\r\nbut, said they, if it please your Majesty, we can demolish one of the\r\nnumerous Stars of the Sky, which the World will never miss.\r\n\r\nThe Empress was very well satisfied with this proposal, and having thus\r\nimployed these two sorts of men, in the mean while builded two Chappels\r\none above another; the one she lined throughout with Diamonds, both\r\nRoof, Walls and Pillars; but the other she resolved to line with the\r\nStar-stone; the Fire- stone she placed upon the Diamond-lining, by\r\nreason Fire has no power on Diamonds; and when she would have that\r\nChappel where the Fire-stone was, appear all in flame, she had by the\r\nmeans of Artificial pipes, water conveighed into it, which by turning\r\nthe Cock, did, as out of a Fountain, spring over all the room, and as\r\nlong as the Fire-stone was wet, the Chappel seemed to be all in a\r\nflaming-fire.\r\n\r\nThe other Chappel, which was lined with the Star- stone, did onely cast\r\na splendorous and comfortable light; both the Chappels stood upon\r\nPillars, just in the middle of a round Cloyster, which was dark as\r\nnight; neither was there any other light within them, but what came from\r\nthe Fire- and Star-stone; and being every where open, allowed to all\r\nthat were within the compass of the Cloyster, a free prospect into them;\r\nbesides, they were so artificially contrived, that they did both move in\r\na Circle about their own Centres, without intermission, contrary ways.\r\nIn the Chappel which was lined with the Fire-stone, the Empress preached\r\nSermons of Terror to the wicked, and told them of the punishments for\r\ntheir sins, to wit, That after this life they should be tormented in an\r\neverlasting Fire. But in the other Chappel lined with the Star- stone,\r\nshe preached Sermons of Comfort to those that repented of their sins,\r\nand were troubled at their own wickedness: Neither did the heat of the\r\nflame in the least hinder her; for the Fire-stone did not cast so great\r\na heat but the Empress was able to endure it, by reason the water which\r\nwas poured on the Stone, by its own self-motion turned into a\r\nflaming-fire, occasioned by the natural motions of the Stone, which made\r\nthe flame weaker then if it had been fed by some other kind of fuel; the\r\nother Chappel where the Star-Stone was, although it did cast a great\r\nlight, yet was it without all heat, and the Empress appear'd like an\r\nAngel in it; and as that Chappel was an embleme of Hell, so this was an\r\nembleme of Heaven. And thus the Empress, by Art, and her own Ingenuity,\r\ndid not onely convert the Blazing-World to her own Religion, but kept\r\nthem in a constant belief, without inforcement or blood-shed; for she\r\nknew well, that belief was a thing not to be forced or pressed upon the\r\npeople, but to be instilled into their minds by gentle perswasions; and\r\nafter this manner she encouraged them also in all other duties and\r\nemployments: for Fear, though it makes people obey, yet does it not last\r\nso long, nor is it so sure a means to keep them to their duties, as Love.\r\n\r\nLast of all, when she saw that both Church and State now in a\r\nwell-ordered and setled condition, her thoughts reflected upon the World\r\nshe came from; and though she had a great desire to know the condition\r\nof the same, yet could she advise no manner of way how to gain any\r\nknowledg thereof; at last, after many serious considerations, she\r\nconceived that it was impossible to be done by any other means, then by\r\nthe help of Immaterial Spirits; wherefore she made a Convocation of the\r\nmost learned, witty and ingenious of all the forementioned sorts of Men,\r\nand desired to know of them, whether there were any Immaterial Spirits\r\nin their World. First, she enquired of the Worm-men, whether they had\r\nperceived some within the Earth? They answered her Majesty, That they\r\nnever knew of any such Creatures; for whatsoever did dwell within the\r\nEarth, said they, was imbodied and material. Then she asked the Fly-men,\r\nwhether they had observed any in the Air? for you having numerous Eyes,\r\nsaid she, will be more able to perceive them, than any other Creatures.\r\nTo which they answered her Majesty, That although Spirits, being\r\nimmaterial, could not be perceived by the Worm-men in the Earth, yet\r\nthey perceived that such Creatures did lodg in the Vehicles of the Air.\r\nThen the Empress asked, Whether they could speak to them, and whether\r\nthey did understand each other? The Fly-men answered, That those Spirits\r\nwere always cloth'd in some sort or other of Material Garments; which\r\nGarments were their Bodies, made, for the most part, of Air; and when\r\noccasion served, they could put on any other sort of substances; but yet\r\nthey could not put these substances into any form or shape, as they\r\npleased. The Empress asked the Fly-men, whether it was possible that she\r\ncould be acquainted, and have some conferences with them?\r\n\r\nThey answered, They did verily believe she might. Hereupon the Empress\r\ncommanded the Fly-men to ask some of the Spirits, Whether they would be\r\npleased to give her a Visit? This they did; and after the Spirits had\r\npresented themselves to the Empress, (in what shapes and forms, I cannot\r\nexactly tell) after some few Complements that passed between them, the\r\nEmpress told the Spirits that she questioned not, but they did know how\r\nshe was a stranger in that World, and by what miraculous means she was\r\narrived there; and since she had a great desire to know the condition of\r\nthe World she came from, her request to the Spirits was, To give her\r\nsome Information thereof, especially of those parts of the World where\r\nshe was born, bred, and educated; as also of her particular friends and\r\nacquaintance: all which, the Spirits did according to her desire. At\r\nlast, after a great many conferences and particular intelligences, which\r\nthe Spirits gave the Empress, to her great satisfaction and content; she\r\nenquired after the most famous Students, Writers, and Experimental\r\nPhilosophers in that World, which they gave her full relation of:\r\namongst the rest she enquired, Whether there were none that had found\r\nout yet the Jews Cabbala? Several have endeavoured it, answered the\r\nSpirits, but those that came nearest (although themselves denied it)\r\nwere one Dr. Dee, and one Edward Kelly, the one representing Moses, and\r\nthe other Aaron; for Kelly was to Dr. Dee, as Aaron to Moses; but yet\r\nthey proved at last but meer Cheats; and were described by one of their\r\nown Country-men, a famous Poet, named Ben. Johnson, in a Play call'd, The\r\nAlchymist, where he expressed Kelly by Capt. Face, and Dee by Dr.\r\nSubtle, and their two Wives by Doll Common, and the Widow; by the\r\nSpaniard the Play, he meant the Spanish Ambassador, and by Sir Epicure\r\nMammon, a Polish Lord. The Empress remembred that she had seen the Play,\r\nand asked the Spirits, whom he meant by the name of Ananias? some\r\nZealous Brethren, answered they, in Holland, Germany, and several other\r\nplaces. Then she asked them, Who was meant by the Druggist? Truly,\r\nanswered the Spirits, We have forgot, it being so long since it was made\r\nand acted. What, replied the Empress, Can Spirits forget? Yes, said the\r\nSpirits; for what is past, is onely kept in memory, if it be not\r\nrecorded. I did believe, said the Empress, That Spirits had no need of\r\nMemory, or Remembrance, and could not be subject to Forgetfulness. How\r\ncan we, answered they, give an account of things present, if we had no\r\nMemory, but especially of things past, unrecorded, if we had no\r\nRemembrance? said the Empress, By present Knowledg and Understanding.\r\nThe Spirits answered, That present Knowledg and Understanding was of\r\nactions or things present, not of past. But, said the Empress, you know\r\nwhat is to come, without Memory or Remembrance; and therefore you may\r\nknow what is past without memory and remembrance. They answered, That\r\ntheir foreknowledg was onely a prudent and subtile Observation made by\r\ncomparing of things or actions past, with those that are present; and\r\nthat Remembrance was nothing else but a Repetition of things or actions\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThen the Empress asked the Spirits, Whether there was a threefold\r\nCabbala? They answered, Dee and Kelly made but a two-fold Cabbala, to\r\nwit, of the Old and New Testament, but others might not onely make two\r\nor three, but threescore Cabbala's, if they pleased. The Empress asked,\r\nWhether it was a Traditional, or meerly a Scriptural, or whether it was\r\na Literal, Philosophical, or Moral Cabbala some, answered they, did\r\nbelieve it meerly Traditional, others Scriptural, some Literal, and some\r\nMetaphorical: but the truth is, said they, 'twas partly one, and partly\r\nthe other; as partly a Traditional, partly a Scriptural, partly Literal,\r\npartly Metaphorical. The Empress asked further, Whether the Cabbala was\r\na work onely of Natural Reason, or of Divine Inspiration? Many, said the\r\nSpirits, that write Cabbala's pretend to Divine Inspirations; but\r\nwhether it be so, or not, it does not belong to us to judg; onely this\r\nwe must needs confess, that it is a work which requires a good wit, and\r\na strong Faith, but not Natural Reason; for though Natural Reason is\r\nmost perswasive, yet Faith is the chief that is required in Cabbalists.\r\nBut, said the Empress, Is there not Divine Reason, as well as there is\r\nNatural? No, answered they: for there is but a Divine Faith, and as for\r\nReason it is onely Natural; but you Mortals are so puzled about this\r\nDivine Faith, and Natural Reason, that you do not know well how to\r\ndistinguish them, but confound them both, which is the cause you have so\r\nmany divine Philosophers who make a Gallimafry both of Reason and Faith.\r\nThen she asked, Whether pure Natural Philosophers were Cabbalists? They\r\nanswered, No; but onely your Mystical or Divine Philosophers, such as\r\nstudy beyond Sense and Reason. she enquired further, Whether there was\r\nany Cabbala in God, or whether God was full of Idea's? They answered,\r\nThere could be nothing in God, nor could God be full of any thing,\r\neither forms or figures, but of himself; for God is the Perfection of\r\nall things, and an Unexpressible Being, beyond the conception of any\r\nCreature, either Natural or Supernatural. Then I pray inform me, said\r\nthe Empress, Whether the Jews Cabbala or any other, consist in Numbers?\r\nThe Spirits answered, No: for Numbers are odd, and different, and would\r\nmake a disagreement in the Cabbala. But, said she again, Is it a sin\r\nthen not to know or understand the Cabbala? God is so merciful, answered\r\nthey, and so just, that he will never damn the ignorant, and save onely\r\nthose that pretend to know him and his secret Counsels by their\r\nCabbala's; but he loves those that adore and worship him with fear and\r\nreverence, and with a pure heart. she asked further, which of these two\r\nCabbala's was most approved, the Natural, or Theological? The\r\nTheological, answered they, is mystical, and belongs onely to Faith; but\r\nthe Natural belongs to Reason. Then she asked them, Whether Divine Faith\r\nwas made out of Reason? No answered they, for Faith proceeds onely from\r\na Divine saving Grace, which is a peculiar Gift of God. How comes it\r\nthen, replied she, that Men, even those that are of several opinions,\r\nhave Faith more or less? A Natural Belief, answered they, is not a\r\nDivine Faith. But, proceeded the Empress, How are you sure that God\r\ncannot be known? The several Opinions you Mortals have of God, answered\r\nthey, are sufficient witnesses thereof. Well then, replied the Empress,\r\nleaving this inquisitive knowledg of God, I pray inform me, whether you\r\nSpirits give motion to Natural Bodies? No, answered they; but, on the\r\ncontrary, Natural material bodies give Spirits motion; for we Spirits,\r\nbeing incorporeal, have no motion but from our Corporeal Vehicles, so\r\nthat we move by the help of our Bodies, and not the Bodies by our help;\r\nfor pure Spirits are immovable. If this be so, replied the Empress, How\r\ncomes it then that you can move so suddenly at a vast distance? They\r\nanswered, That some sorts of matter were more pure, rare, and\r\nconsequently more light and agil then others; and this was the reason\r\nfor their quick and sudden motions. Then the Empress asked them, Whether\r\nthey could speak without a body, or bodily organs? No, said they; nor\r\ncould we have any bodily sense, but onely knowledg. she asked, Whether\r\nthey could have Knowledg without Body? Not a Natural, answered they, but\r\na Supernatural Knowledg, which is a far better Knowledg then a Natural.\r\nThen she asked them, Whether they had a General or Universal Knowledg?\r\nThey answered, Single or particular created Spirits, have not; for not\r\nany Creature, but God Himself, can have an absolute and perfect knowledg\r\nof all things. The Empress asked them further, Whether Spirits had\r\ninward and outward parts? No, answered they; for parts onely belong to\r\nbodies, not to Spirits. Again, she asked them, Whether their Vehicles\r\nwere living Bodies? They are Self-moving Bodies, answered they, and\r\ntherefore they must needs be living; for nothing can move it self,\r\nwithout it hath life. Then, said she, it must necessarily follow, that\r\nthis living, Self-moving Body gives motion to the Spirit, and not the\r\nSpirit motion to the Body, as its Vehicle. You say very true, answered\r\nthey, and we told you this before. Then the Empress asked them, Of what\r\nforms of Matter those Vehicles were? They said they were of several\r\ndifferent forms; some gross and dense, and others more pure, rare, and\r\nsubtil. If you be not Material, said the Empress, how can you be\r\nGenerators of all Creatures? We are no more, answered they, the\r\nGenerators of material Creatures, then they are the Generators of us\r\nSpirits. Then she asked, Whether they did leave their Vehicles? No,\r\nanswered they; for we being incorporeal, cannot leave or quit them: but\r\nour Vehicles do change into several forms and figures, according as\r\noccasion requires. Then the Empress desired the Spirits to tell her,\r\nWhether Man was a little World? They answered, That if a Fly or Worm was\r\na little World, then Man was so too. she asked again, Whether our\r\nFore-fathers had been as wise, as Men were at present, and had\r\nunderstood sense and reason, as well as they did now? They answered,\r\nThat in former Ages they had been as wise as they are in this present,\r\nnay, wiser; for, said they, many in this age do think their Fore-fathers\r\nhave been Fools, by which they prove themselves to be such. The Empress\r\nasked further, Whether there was any Plastick power in Nature? Truly,\r\nsaid the Spirits, Plastick power is a hard word, & signifies no more\r\nthen the power of the corporeal, figurative motions of Nature. After\r\nthis, the Empress desired the Spirits to inform her where the Paradise\r\nwas, Whether it was in the midst of the World as a Centre of pleasure?\r\nor, Whether it was the whole World; or a peculiar World by it self, as a\r\nWorld of Life, and not of Matter; or whether it was mixt, as a world of\r\nliving animal Creatures? They answered, That Paradise was not in the\r\nworld she came from, but in that world she lived in at present; and that\r\nit was the very same place where she kept her Court, and where her\r\nPalace stood, in the midst of the Imperial City. The Empress asked\r\nfurther, Whether in the beginning and Creation of the World, all Beasts\r\ncould speak? They answered, That no Beasts could speak, but onely those\r\nsorts of Creatures which were Fish-men, Bear-men, Worm-men, and the\r\nlike, which could speak in the first Age, as well as they do now. she\r\nasked again, Whether they were none of those Spirits that frighted Adam\r\nout of the Paradise, at least caused him not to return thither again?\r\nThey answered they were not. Then she desired to be informed, whither\r\nAdam fled when he was driven out of the Paradise? Out of this World,\r\nsaid they, you are now Empress of, into the World you came from. If this\r\nbe so, replied the Empress, then surely those Cabbalists are much out of\r\ntheir story, who believe the Paradise to be a world of Life onely,\r\nwithout Matter, for this world, though it be most pleasant and fruitful,\r\nyet it is not a world of meer Immaterial life, but a world of living,\r\nMaterial Creatures. Without question, they are, answered the Spirits;\r\nfor not all Cabbala's are true. Then the Empress asked, That since it is\r\nmentioned in the story of the Creation of the World, that Eve was\r\ntempted by the Serpent, Whether the Devil was within the Serpent, or,\r\nWhether the Serpent tempted her without the Devil? They answered, That\r\nthe Devil was within the Serpent. But how came it then, replied she,\r\nthat the Serpent was cursed? They answered, because the Devil was in\r\nhim; for are not those men in danger of damnation which have the Devil\r\nwithin them, who perswades them to believe and act wickedly? The Empress\r\nasked further, Whether Light and the Heavens were all one? They\r\nanswered, That that Region which contains the Lucid natural Orbs, was by\r\nMortals named Heaven; but the Beatifical Heaven, which is the Habitation\r\nof the Blessed Angels and Souls, was so far beyond it, that it could not\r\nbe compared to any Natural Creature. Then the Empress asked them,\r\nWhether all Matter was fluid at first? They answered, That Matter was\r\nalways as it is, and that some parts of Matter were rare, some dense,\r\nsome fluid, some solid, &c. Neither was God bound to make all Matter\r\nfluid at first. she asked further, Whether Matter was immovable in it\r\nself? We have answered you before, said they, That there is no motion\r\nbut in Matter; and were it not for the motion of Matter, we Spirits,\r\ncould not move, nor give you any answer to your several questions. After\r\nthis, the Empress asked the Spirits, Whether the Universe was made\r\nwithin the space of six days, or, Whether by those six days, were meant\r\nso many Decrees or Commands of God? They answered her, That the World\r\nwas made by the All-powerful Decree and Command of God; but whether\r\nthere were six Decrees or Commands, or fewer, or more, no Creature was\r\nable to tell.\r\n\r\nThen she inquired, Whether there was no mystery in Numbers? No other\r\nmystery, answered the Spirits, but reckoning or counting; for Numbers\r\nare onely marks of remembrance. But what do you think of the Number of\r\nFour, said she, which Cabbalists make such ado withal, and of the Number\r\nof Ten, when they say that Ten is all, and that all Numbers are\r\nvirtually comprehended in Four? We think, answered they, that Cabbalists\r\nhave nothing else to do but to trouble their heads with such useless\r\nFancies; for naturally there is no such thing as prime or all in\r\nNumbers; nor is there any other mystery in Numbers, but what Man's fancy\r\nmakes; but what Men call Prime, or All, we do not know, because they do\r\nnot agree in the number of their opinion. Then the Empress asked,\r\nWhether the number of six was a symbole of Matrimony, as being made up\r\nof Male and Femal, for two into three is six. If any number can be a\r\nsymbole of Matrimony, answered the Spirits, it is not Six, but Two; if\r\ntwo may be allowed to be a Number: for the act of Matrimony is made up\r\nof two joined in one. she asked again, What they said to the number of\r\nSeven? whether it was not an Embleme of God, because Cabbalists say,\r\nThat it is neither begotten, nor begets any other Number? There can be\r\nno Embleme of God, answered the Spirits; for if we do not know what God\r\nis, how can we make an Embleme of him? Nor is there any Number in God,\r\nfor God is the perfection Himself; but Numbers are imperfect; and as for\r\nthe begetting of numbers, it is done by Multiplication and Addition; but\r\nSubstraction is as a kind of death to Numbers. If there be no mystery in\r\nNumbers, replied the Empress then it is in vain to refer to the Creation\r\nof the World to certain Numbers, as Cabbalists do. The onely mystery of\r\nNumbers, answered they, concerning the Creation of the World, is, that\r\nas Numbers do multiply, so does the World. The Empress asked, how far\r\nNumbers did multiply? The Spirits answered, to Infinite. Why, said she,\r\nInfinite cannot be reckoned, nor numbred. No more, answered they, can\r\nthe parts of the Universe; for God's Creation, being an Infinite action,\r\nas proceeding from an Infinite Power, could not rest upon a finite\r\nNumber of Creatures, were it never so great. But leaving the mystery of\r\nNumbers, proceeded the Empress, Let me now desire you to inform me,\r\nWhether the Suns and Planets were generated by the Heavens, or Æthereal\r\nMatter? The Spirits answered, That the Stars and Planets were of the\r\nsame matter which the Heavens, the Æther, and all other Natural\r\nCreatures did consist of; but whether they were generated by the Heavens\r\nor Æther, they could not tell: if they be, said they, they are not like\r\ntheir Parents; for the Sun, Stars, and Planets, are more splendorous\r\nthen the Æther, as also more solid and constant in their motions: But\r\nput the case, the Stars and Planets were generated by the Heavens, and\r\nthe Æthereal Matter; the question then would be, Out of what these are\r\ngenerated or produced? If these be created out of nothing, and not\r\ngenerated out of something, then it is probable the Sun, Stars and\r\nPlanets are so too; nay, it is more probable of the Stars, and Planets,\r\nthen of the Heavens, or the fluid Æther, by reason the Stars and Planets\r\nseem to be further off from Mortality, then the particular parts of the\r\nÆther; for no doubt but the parts of the Æthereal Matter, alter into\r\nseveral forms, which we do not perceive of the Stars and Planets. The\r\nEmpress asked further, Whether they could give her information of the\r\nthree principles of Man, according to the doctrine of the Platonists; as\r\nfirst of the Intellect, Spirit, or Divine Light. 2. Of the Soul of Man\r\nher self: and 3. Of the Image of the Soul, that is, her vital operation\r\non the body? The Spirits answered, That they did not understand these\r\nthree distinctions, but that they seem'd to corporeal sense and reason,\r\nas if they were three several bodies, or three several corporeal\r\nactions; however, said they, they are intricate conceptions of irregular\r\nFancies. If you do not understand them, replied the Empress, how shall\r\nhuman Creatures do then? Many, both of your modern and ancient\r\nPhilosophers, answered the Spirits, endeavour to go beyond Sense and\r\nReason, which makes them commit absurdities; for no corporeal Creature\r\ncan go beyond Sense and Reason; no not we Spirits, as long as we are in\r\nour corporeal Vehicles. Then the Empress asked them, Whether there were\r\nany Atheists in the World? The Spirits answered, That there were no more\r\nAtheists then what Cabbalists make. she asked them further, Whether\r\nSpirits were of a globous or round Figure? They answered, That Figure\r\nbelonged to body, but they being immaterial, had no Figure. she asked\r\nagain, Whether Spirits were not like Water or Fire? They answered, that\r\nWater and Fire was material, were it the purest and most refined that\r\never could be; nay, were it above the Heavens: But we are no more like\r\nWater or Fire, said they, then we are like Earth; but our Vehicles are\r\nof several forms, figures and degrees of substances. Then she desired to\r\nknow, Whether their Vehicles were made of Air? Yes, answered the\r\nSpirits, some of our Vehicles are of thin Air. Then I suppose, replied\r\nthe Empress, That those airy Vehicles, are your corporeal Summer-suits.\r\nshe asked further, Whether the Spirits had not ascending and\r\ndescending-motions, as well as other Creatures? They answered, That\r\nproperly there was no ascension or descension in Infinite Nature, but\r\nonely in relation to particular parts; and as for us Spirits, said they,\r\nWe can neither ascend nor descend without corporeal Vehicles; nor can\r\nour Vehicles ascend or descend, but according to their several shapes\r\nand figures, for there can be no motion without body. The Empress asked\r\nthem further, Whether there was not a World of Spirits, as well as there\r\nis of Material Creatures? No, answered they; for the word World implies\r\na quantity or multitude of corporeal Creatures, but we being Immaterial,\r\ncan make no World of Spirits. Then she desired to be informed when\r\nSpirits were made? We do not know, answered they, how and when we were\r\nmade, nor are we much inquisitive after it; nay, if we did, it would be\r\nno benefit, neither for us, nor for you Mortals to know it. The Empress\r\nreplied, That Cabbalists and Divine Philosophers said, Mens rational\r\nSouls were Immaterial, and stood as much in need of corporeal Vehicles,\r\nas Spirits did. If this be so, answered the Spirits, then you are\r\nHermaphrodites of Nature; but your Cabbalists are mistaken, for they\r\ntake the purest and subtilest parts of Matter, for Immaterial Spirits.\r\nThen the Empress asked, When the Souls of Mortals went out of their\r\nBodies, whether they went to Heaven or Hell; or whether, they remained\r\nin airy Vehicles? God's Justice and Mercy, answered they, is perfect,\r\nand not imperfect; but if you Mortals will have Vehicles for your Souls,\r\nand a place that is between Heaven and Hell, it must be Purgatory, which\r\nis a place of Purification, for which action Fire is more proper then\r\nAir; and so the Vehicles of those Souls that are in Purgatory, cannot be\r\nairy, but fiery; and after this rate there can be but four places for\r\nhuman Souls to be in, viz. Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, and this World; but\r\nas for Vehicles, they are but fancies, not real truths. Then the Empress\r\nasked them, Where Heaven and Hell was? Your Saviour Christ, answered the\r\nSpirits, has informed you, that there is Heaven and Hell, but he did not\r\ntell you what, nor where they are; wherefore it is too great a\r\npresumption for you Mortals to inquire after it: If you do but strive to\r\nget into Heaven, it is enough, though you do not know where or what it\r\nis; for it is beyond your knowledg and understanding. I am satisfied,\r\nreplied the Empress; and asked further, Whether there were any Figures\r\nor Characters in the Soul? They answered, Where there was no Body, there\r\ncould be no Figure. Then she asked them, Whether Spirits could be naked?\r\nand whether they were of a dark, or a light colour? As for our\r\nNakedness, it is a very odd question, answered the Spirits; and we do\r\nnot know what you mean by a Naked Spirit; for you judg of us as of\r\ncorporeal Creatures; and as for Colour, said they, it is according to\r\nour Vehicles; for Colour belongs to Body, and as there is no Body that\r\nis colourless, so there is no Colour that is bodiless. Then the Empress\r\ndesired to be informed, Whether all Souls were made at the first\r\nCreation of the World? We know no more, answered the Spirits, of the\r\norigin of humane Souls, then we know of our Selves. she asked further,\r\nWhether humane bodies were not burthensome to humane Souls? They\r\nanswered, That Bodies, made Souls active, as giving them motion; and if\r\naction was troublesome to Souls, then Bodies were so too. she asked\r\nagain, Whether Souls did chuse Bodies? They answered, That Platonicks\r\nbelieved, the Souls of Lovers lived in the Bodies of their Beloved, but\r\nsurely, said they, if there be a multitude of Souls in a World of\r\nMatter, they cannot miss Bodies; for as soon as a Soul is parted from\r\none Body, it enters into another; and Souls having no motion of\r\nthemselves, must of necessity be clothed or imbodied with the next parts\r\nof Matter. If this be so, replied the Empress, then I pray inform me,\r\nWhether all matter be soulified? The Spirits answered, They could not\r\nexactly tell that; but if it was true, that Matter had no other motion\r\nbut what came from a spiritual power, and that all matter was moving,\r\nthen no soul could quit a Body, but she must, of necessity enter into\r\nanother soulified Body, and then there would be two immaterial\r\nsubstances in one Body. The Empress asked, Whether it was not possible\r\nthat there could be two Souls in one Body? As for Immaterial Souls,\r\nanswered the Spirits, it is impossible; for there cannot be two\r\nImmaterials in one Inanimate Body, by reason they want parts, and place,\r\nbeing bodiless; but there may be numerous material Souls in one composed\r\nBody, by reason every material part has a material natural Soul; for\r\nNature is but one Infinite self-moving, living and self-knowing body,\r\nconsisting of the three degrees of inanimate, sensitive and rational\r\nMatter, so intermixt together, that no part of Nature, were it an Atom,\r\ncan be without any of these three Degrees; the sensitive is the Life,\r\nthe rational the Soul, and the inanimate part, the Body of Infinite\r\nNature. The Empress was very well satisfied with this answer, and asked\r\nfurther, Whether souls did not give life to bodies? No, answered they;\r\nbut Spirits and Divine Souls have a life of their own, which is not to\r\nbe divided, being purer then a natural life; for Spirits are\r\nincorporeal, and consequently indivisible. But when the Soul is in its\r\nVehicle, said the Empress, then methinks she is like the Sun, and the\r\nVehicle like the Moon. No, answered they; but the Vehicle is like the\r\nSun, and the Soul like the Moon; for the Soul hath motion from the Body,\r\nas the Moon has light from the Sun. Then the Empress asked the Spirits,\r\nWhether it was an evil Spirit that tempted Eve, and brought all the\r\nmischiefs upon Mankind: or, Whether it was the Serpent? They answered,\r\nThat Spirits could not commit actual evils. The Empress said, they might\r\ndo it by perswasions. They answered, That Perswasions were actions; But\r\nthe Empress not being contented with this answer, asked, Whether there\r\nwas not a supernatural Evil? The Spirits answered, That there was a\r\nSupernatural Good, which was God; but they knew of no Supernatural Evil,\r\nthat was equal to God. Then she desired to know, Whether Evil Spirits\r\nwere reckoned amongst the Beasts of the Field? They answer'd, That many\r\nBeasts of the field were harmless Creatures, and very serviceable for\r\nMan's use; and though some were accounted fierce and cruel, yet did they\r\nexercise their cruelty upon other Creatures, for the most part, to no\r\nother end, but to get themselves food, and to satisfie their natural\r\nappetite; but certainly, said they, you Men are more cruel to one\r\nanother, then evil Spirits are to you; and as for their habitations in\r\ndesolate places, we having no communion with them, can give you no\r\ncertain account thereof. But what do you think, said the Empress, of\r\ngood Spirits? may not they be compared to the Fowls of the Air? They\r\nanswered, There were many cruel and ravenous Fowls as well in the Air,\r\nas there were fierce and cruel Beasts on Earth; so that the good are\r\nalways mixt with the bad. she asked further, Whether the fiery Vehicles\r\nwere a Heaven, or a Hell, or at least a Purgatory to the Souls? They\r\nanswered, That if the Souls were immaterial, they could not burn, and\r\nthen fire would do them no harm; and though Hell was believed to be an\r\nundecaying and unquenchable fire, yet Heaven was no fire. The Empress\r\nreplied, That Heaven was a Light. Yes, said they, but not a fiery Light.\r\nThen she asked, Whether the different shapes and sorts of Vehicles, made\r\nthe Souls and other Immaterial Spirits, miserable, or blessed? The\r\nVehicles, answered they, make them neither better, nor worse; for though\r\nsome Vehicles sometimes may have power over others, yet these by turns\r\nmay get some power again over them, according to the several advantages\r\nand disadvantages of particular Natural parts. The Empress asked\r\nfurther, Whether Animal life came out of the spiritual World, and did\r\nreturn thither again? The Spirits answered, They could not exactly tell;\r\nbut if it were so, then certainly Animal lives must leave their bodies\r\nbehind them, otherwise the bodies would make the spiritual World a mixt\r\nWorld, that is, partly material, and partly immaterial; but the Truth\r\nis, said they, Spirits being immaterial, cannot properly make a World;\r\nfor a World belongs to material, not to immaterial Creatures. If this be\r\nso, replied the Empress, then certainly there can be no world of Lives\r\nand Forms without Matter? No, answered the Spirits; nor a world of\r\nMatter without Lives and Forms; for Natural Lives and Forms cannot be\r\nimmaterial, no more then Matter can be immovable. And therefore natural\r\nlives, forms and matter, are inseparable. Then the Empress asked,\r\nWhether the first Man did feed on the best sorts of the Fruits of the\r\nEarth, and the Beasts on the worst? The Spirits answered, That unless\r\nthe Beasts of the field were barred out of manured fields and gardens,\r\nthey would pick and chuse the best Fruits as well as Men; and you may\r\nplainly observe it, said they, in Squirrels and Monkies, how they are\r\nthe best Chusers of Nuts and Apples; and how Birds do pick and feed in\r\nthe most delicious fruits, and Worms on the best roots, and most savoury\r\nherbs; by which you may see, that those Creatures live and feed better\r\nthen men do, except you will say, that artificial Cookery is better and\r\nmore wholsome then the natural. Again, the Empress asked, Whether the\r\nfirst Man gave Names to all the several sorts of Fishes in the Sea, and\r\nfresh Waters? No, answered the Spirits, for he was an Earthly, and not a\r\nWatery Creature; and therefore could not know the several sorts of\r\nFishes. Why, replied the Empress, he was no more an Airy Creature then\r\nhe was a Watery one, and yet he gave Names to the several sorts of Fowls\r\nand Birds of the Air. Fowls, answered they, are partly Airy, and partly\r\nEarthly Creatures, not onely because they resemble Beasts and Men in\r\ntheir flesh, but because their rest and dwelling places are on Earth;\r\nfor they build their Nests, lay their Eggs, and hatch their Young, not\r\nin the Air, but on the Earth. Then she asked, Whether the first Man did\r\ngive Names to all the various sorts of Creatures that live on the Earth?\r\nYes, answered they, to all those that were presented to him, or he had\r\nknowledg of, that is, to all the prime sorts; but not to every\r\nparticular: for of Mankind, said they, there were but two at first; and\r\nas they did encrease, so did their Names. But, said the Empress, who\r\ngave the Names to the several sorts of Fish? The posterity of Mankind,\r\nanswered they. Then she enquired, Whether there were no more kinds of\r\nCreatures now, then at the first Creation? They answered, That there\r\nwere no more nor fewer kinds of Creatures then there are now; but there\r\nare, without question, more particular sorts of Creatures now, then\r\nthere were then. she asked again, Whether all those Creatures that were\r\nin Paradise, were also in Noah's Ark? They answered, That the principal\r\nkinds had been there, but not all the particulars. Then she would fain\r\nknow, how it came, that both Spirits and Men did fall from a blessed\r\ninto so miserable a state and condition as they are now in. The Spirits\r\nanswered, By disobedience. The Empress asked, Whence this disobedient\r\nsin did proceed? But the Spirits desired the Empress not to ask them any\r\nsuch questions, because they went beyond their knowledg. Then she begg'd\r\nthe Spirits to pardon her presumption; for, said she, It is the nature\r\nof Mankind to be inquisitive. Natural desire of knowledg, answered the\r\nSpirits, is not blameable, so you do not go beyond what your Natural\r\nReason can comprehend. Then I'le ask no more, said the Empress, for fear\r\nI should commit some error; but one thing I cannot but acquaint you\r\nwithal: What is that, said the Spirits? I have a great desire, answered\r\nthe Empress, to make a Cabbala. What kind of Cabbala asked the Spirits?\r\nThe Empress answered, The Jews Cabbala. No sooner had the Empress\r\ndeclared her Mind, but the Spirits immediately disappeared out of her\r\nsight; which startled the Empress so much, that she fell into a Trance,\r\nwherein she lay for some while; at last being come to her self again,\r\nshe grew very studious, and considering with her self what might be the\r\ncause of this strange dysaster, conceived at first, that perhaps the\r\nSpirits were tired with hearing and giving answers to her Questions; but\r\nthinking by her self, That Spirits could not be tired, she imagined that\r\nthis was not the true cause of their disappearing, till, after divers\r\ndebates with her own thoughts, she did verily believe that the Spirits\r\nhad committed some fault in their answers, and that for their punishment\r\nthey were condemned to the lowest and darkest Vehicles. This belief was\r\nso fixt in her mind, that it put her into a very Melancholick humor; and\r\nthen she sent both for her Fly-men and Worm-men, and declared to them\r\nthe cause of her sadness. 'Tis not so much, said she, the vanishing of\r\nthose Spirits that makes me Melancholick, but that I should be the cause\r\nof their miserable condition, and that those harmless Spirits should,\r\nfor my sake, sink down into the black and dark abyss of the Earth. The\r\nWorm-men comforted the Empress, telling her, That the Earth was not so\r\nhorrid a Dwelling, as she did imagine; for, said they, not onely all\r\nMinerals and Vegetables, but several sorts of Animals can witness, that\r\nthe Earth is a warm, fruitful, quiet, safe, and happy habitation; and\r\nthough they want the light of the Sun, yet are they not in the dark, but\r\nthere is light even within the Earth, by which those Creatures do see\r\nthat dwell therein. This relation setled her Majesties mind a little;\r\nbut yet she being desirous to know the Truth, where, and in what\r\ncondition those Spirits were, commanded both the Fly- and Worm-men to\r\nuse all labour and industry to find them out; whereupon the Worm-men\r\nstraight descended into the Earth, and the Fly-men ascended into the\r\nAir. After some short time, the Worm-men returned, and told the Empress,\r\nthat when they went into the Earth, they inquired of all the Creatures\r\nthey met withal, Whether none of them had perceived such or such\r\nSpirits; until at last coming to the very Center of the Earth, they were\r\ntruly informed, that those Spirits had stayed some time there, but at\r\nlast were gone to the Antipodes on the other side of the Terrestrial\r\nGlobe, diametrically opposite to theirs. The Fly-men seconded the\r\nWormmen, assuring her Majesty, that their relation was very true; for,\r\nsaid they, We have rounded the Earth, and just when we came to the\r\nAntipodes, we met those Spirits in a very good condition, and acquainted\r\nthem that your Majesty was very much troubled at their sudden departure,\r\nand fear'd they should be buried in the darkness of the Earth: whereupon\r\nthe Spirits answered us, That they were sorry for having occasioned such\r\nsadness and trouble in your Majesty; and desired us to tell your\r\nMajesty, that they feared no darkness; for their Vehicles were of such a\r\nsort of substance as Cats eyes, Glow-worms tails, and rotten Wood,\r\ncarrying their light along with them; and that they were ready to do\r\nyour Majesty what service they could, in making your Cabbala. At which\r\nRelation the Empress was exceedingly glad, and rewarded both her Fly-\r\nand Worm-men bountifully.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, when the Spirits had refreshed themselves in their own\r\nVehicles, they sent one of their nimblest Spirits, to ask the Empress,\r\nWhether she would have a Scribe, or, whether she would write the Cabbala\r\nher self? The Empress received the proffer which they made her, with all\r\ncivility; and told them, that she desired a Spiritual Scribe. The\r\nSpirits answer'd, That they could dictate, but not write, except they\r\nput on a hand or arm, or else the whole body of Man. The Empress\r\nreplied, How can Spirits arm themselves with gantlets of Flesh? As well,\r\nanswered they, as Man can arm himself with a gantlet of steel. If it be\r\nso, said the Empress, then I will have a Scribe. Then the Spirits asked\r\nher, Whether she would have the Soul of a living or a dead Man? Why,\r\nsaid the Empress, can the Soul quit a living Body, and wander or travel\r\nabroad? Yes, answered they, for according to Plato's Doctrine, there is\r\na Conversation of Souls, and the Souls of Lovers live in the Bodies of\r\ntheir Beloved. Then I will have, answered she, the Soul of some ancient\r\nfamous Writer, either of Aristotle, Pythagoras, Plato, Epicurus, or the\r\nlike. The Spirits said, That those famous Men were very learned,\r\nsubtile, and ingenious Writers; but they were so wedded to their own\r\nopinions, that they would never have the patience to be Scribes. Then,\r\nsaid she, I'le have the Soul of one of the most famous modern Writers,\r\nas either of Galileo, Gassendus, Des Cartes, Helmont, Hobbes, H. More,\r\n&c. The Spirits answered, That they were fine ingenious Writers, but yet\r\nso self-conceited, that they would scorn to be Scribes to a Woman. But,\r\nsaid they, there's a Lady, the Duchess of Newcastle; which although she\r\nis not one of the most learned, eloquent, witty and ingenious, yet she\r\nis a plain and rational Writer; for the principle of her Writings, is\r\nSense and Reason, and she will without question, be ready to do you all\r\nthe service she can. That Lady then, said the Empress, will I chuse for\r\nmy Scribe, neither will the Emperor have reason to be jealous, she being\r\none of my own sex. In truth, said the Spirit, Husbands have reason to be\r\njealous of Platonick Lovers, for they are very dangerous, as being not\r\nonely intimate and close, but subtil and insinuating. You say well,\r\nreplied the Empress; wherefore I pray send me the Duchess of Newcastle's\r\nSoul; which the Spirit did; and after she came to wait on the Empress,\r\nat her first arrival the Empress imbraced and saluted her with a\r\nSpiritual kiss; then she asked her whether she could write? Yes,\r\nanswered the Duchess's Soul, but not so intelligibly that any Reader\r\nwhatsoever may understand it, unless he be taught to know my Characters;\r\nfor my Letters are rather like Characters, then well formed Letters.\r\nSaid the Empress, you were recommended to me by an honest and ingenious\r\nSpirit. Surely, answered the Duchess, the Spirit is ignorant of my\r\nhand-writing. The truth is, said the Empress, he did not mention your\r\nhand-writing; but he informed me, that you writ Sense and Reason, and if\r\nyou can but write so, that any of my Secretaries may learn your hand,\r\nthey shall write it out fair and intelligible. The Duchess answered,\r\nThat she questioned not but it might easily be learned in a short time.\r\nBut, said she to the Empress, What is it that your Majesty would have\r\nwritten? she answered, The Jews Cabbala. Then your onely way for that\r\nis, said the Duchess, to have the Soul of some famous Jew; nay, if your\r\nMajesty please, I scruple not, but you may as easily have the Soul of\r\nMoses, as of any other. That cannot be, replied the Empress, for no\r\nMortal knows where Moses is. But, said the Duchess, humane Souls are\r\nimmortal; however, if this be too difficult to be obtained, you may have\r\nthe Soul of one of the chief Rabbies or Sages of the Tribe of Levi, who\r\nwill truly instruct you in that mystery; when as, otherwise, your\r\nMajesty will be apt to mistake, and a thousand to one, will commit gross\r\nerrors. No, said the Empress, for I shall be instructed by Spirits.\r\nAlas! said the Duchess, Spirits are as ignorant as Mortals in many\r\ncases; for no created Spirits have a general or absolute knowledg, nor\r\ncan they know the Thoughts of Men, much less the Mysteries of the great\r\nCreator, unless he be pleased to inspire into them the gift of Divine\r\nKnowledg. Then, I pray, said the Empress, let me have your counsel in\r\nthis case. The Duchess answered, If your Majesty will be pleased to\r\nhearken to my advice, I would desire you to let that work alone; for it\r\nwill be of no advantage either to you, or your people, unless you were\r\nof the Jews Religion; nay, if you were, the vulgar interpretation of the\r\nholy Scripture would be more instructive, and more easily believed, then\r\nyour mystical way of interpreting it; for had it been better and more\r\nadvantagious for the Salvation of the Jews, surely Moses would have\r\nsaved after Ages that labour by his own Explanation, he being not onely\r\na wise, but a very honest, zealous and religious Man: Wherefore the best\r\nway, said she, is to believe with the generality the literal sense of\r\nthe Scripture, and not to make interpretations every one according to\r\nhis own fancy, but to leave that work for the Learned, or those that\r\nhave nothing else to do; Neither do I think, said she, that God will\r\ndamn those that are ignorant therein, or suffer them to be lost for want\r\nof a Mystical interpretation of the Scripture. Then, said the Empress,\r\nI'le leave the Scripture, and make a Philosophical Cabbala. The Duchess\r\ntold her, That, Sense and Reason would instruct her of a Nature as much\r\nas could be known; and as for Numbers, they were infinite; but to add\r\nnon-sense to infinite, would breed a confusion, especially in Humane\r\nUnderstanding. Then, replied the Empress, I'le make a Moral Cabbala. The\r\nonely thing, answered the Duchess, in Morality, is but, To fear God, and\r\nto love his Neighbour, and this needs no further interpretation. But\r\nthen I'le make a Political Cabbala, said the Empress. The Duchess\r\nanswered, That the chief and onely ground in Government, was but Reward\r\nand Punishment, and required no further Cabbala; But, said she, If your\r\nMajesty were resolved to make a Cabbala, I would advise you, rather to\r\nmake a Poetical or Romancical Cabbala, wherein you may use Metaphors,\r\nAllegories, Similitudes, &c. and interpret them as you please. With that\r\nthe Empress thank'd the Duchess, and embracing her Soul, told her she\r\nwould take her Counsel: she made her also her Favourite, and kept her\r\nsometime in that World, and by this means the Duchess came to know and\r\ngive this Relation of all that passed in that rich, populous, and happy\r\nWorld; and after some time the Empress gave her leave to return to her\r\nHusband and Kindred into her Native World, but upon condition, that her\r\nSoul should visit her now and then; which she did: and truly their\r\nmeeting did produce such an intimate friendship between them, that they\r\nbecame Platonick Lovers, although they were both Femals.\r\n\r\nOne time, when the Duchess her Soul was with the Empress, she seem'd to\r\nbe very sad and melancholy; at which the Empress was very much troubled,\r\nand asked her the reason of her Melancholick humour? Truly, said the\r\nDuchess to the Empress, (for between dear friends there's no\r\nconcealment, they being like several parts of one united body) my\r\nMelancholy proceeds from an extream Ambition. The Empress asked, What\r\nthe height of her ambition was? The Duchess answered, That neither she\r\nher self, nor no Creature in the World was able to know either the\r\nheight, depth, or breadth of her Ambition; but said she, my present\r\ndesire is, that I would be a great Princess. The Empress replied, so you\r\nare; for you are a Princess of the fourth or fifth Degree, for a Duke or\r\nDuchess is the highest title or honour that a subject can arrive to, as\r\nbeing the next to a King's Title; and as for the name of a Prince of\r\nPrincess, it belongs to all that are adopted to the Crown; so that those\r\nthat can add a Crown to their Arms, are Princes, and therefore a Duke is\r\na Title above a Prince; for example, the Duke of Savoy, the Duke of\r\nFlorence, the Duke of Lorrain, as also Kings Brothers, are not called by\r\nthe name of Princes, but Dukes, this being the higher Title. 'Tis true,\r\nanswered the Duchess, unless it be Kings Eldest sons, and they are\r\ncreated Princes. Yes, replied the Empress, but no soveraign does make a\r\nsubject equal to himself, such as Kings eldest sons partly are: And\r\nalthough some Dukes be soveraigns, yet I have heard that a Prince by his\r\nTitle is soveraign, by reason the Title of a Prince is more a Title of\r\nHonour, then of soveraignty; for, as I said before, it belongs to all\r\nthat are adopted to the Crown. Well, said the Duchess, setting aside\r\nthis dispute, my Ambition is, That I would fain be as you are, that is,\r\nan Empress of a World, and I shall never be at quiet until I be one. I\r\nlove you so well, replied the Empress, that I wish with all my soul, you\r\nhad the fruition of your ambitious desire, and I shall not fail to give\r\nyou my best advice how to accomplish it; the best informers are the\r\nImmaterial Spirits, and they'l soon tell you, Whether it be possible to\r\nobtain your wish. But, said the Duchess, I have little acquaintance with\r\nthem, for I never knew any before the time you sent for me. They know\r\nyou, replied the Empress; for they told me of you, and were the means\r\nand instrument of your coming hither: Wherefore I'le conferr with them,\r\nand enquire whether there be not another World, whereof you may be\r\nEmpress as well as I am of this? No sooner had the Empress said this,\r\nbut some Immaterial Spirits came to visit her, of whom she inquired,\r\nWhether there were but three Worlds in all, to wit, the Blazing World\r\nwhere she was in, the World which she came from, and the World where the\r\nDuchess lived? The Spirits answered, That there were more numerous\r\nWorlds then the Stars which appeared in these three mentioned Worlds.\r\nThen the Empress asked, Whether it was not possible that her dearest\r\nfriend the Duchess of Newcastle, might be Empress of one of them?\r\nAlthough there be numerous, nay, infinite Worlds, answered the Spirits,\r\nyet none is without Government. But is none of these Worlds so weak,\r\nsaid she, that it may be surprized or conquered? The Spirits answered,\r\nThat Lucian's World of Lights, had been for some time in a snuff, but of\r\nlate years one Helmont had got it, who since he was Emperour of it, had\r\nso strengthened the Immortal parts thereof with mortal out-works, as it\r\nwas for the present impregnable. said the Empress, If there be such an\r\nInfinite number of Worlds, I am sure, not onely my friend, the Duchess,\r\nbut any other might obtain one. Yes, answered the Spirits, if those\r\nWorlds were uninhabited; but they are as populous as this your Majesty\r\ngoverns. Why, said the Empress, it is not possible to conquer a World.\r\nNo, answered the Spirits, but, for the most part, Conquerers seldom\r\nenjoy their conquest, for they being more feared then loved, most\r\ncommonly come to an untimely end. If you will but direct me, said the\r\nDuchess to the Spirits, which World is easiest to be conquered, her\r\nMajesty will assist me with Means, and I will trust to Fate and Fortune;\r\nfor I had rather die in the adventure of noble atchievements, then live\r\nin obscure and sluggish security; since the by one, I may live in a\r\nglorious Fame; and by the other I am buried in oblivion. The Spirits\r\nanswered, That the lives of Fame were like other lives; for some lasted\r\nlong, and some died soon. 'Tis true, said the Duchess; but yet the\r\nshortest-liv'd Fame lasts longer then the longest life of Man. But,\r\nreplied the Spirits, if occasion does not serve you, you must content\r\nyour self to live without such atchievements that may gain you a Fame:\r\nBut we wonder, proceeded the Spirits, that you desire to be Empress of a\r\nTerrestrial World, when as you can create your self a Cœlestial World if\r\nyou please. What, said the Empress, can any Mortal be a Creator? Yes,\r\nanswered the Spirits; for every human Creature can create an Immaterial\r\nWorld fully inhabited by Immaterial Creatures, and populous of\r\nImmaterial subjects, such as we are, and all this within the compass of\r\nthe head or scull; nay, not onely so, but he may create a World of what\r\nfashion and Government he will, and give the Creatures thereof such\r\nmotions, figures, forms, colours, perceptions, &c. as he pleases, and\r\nmake Whirl-pools, Lights, Pressures, and Reactions, &c. as he thinks\r\nbest; nay, he may make a World full of Veins, Muscles, and Nerves, and\r\nall these to move by one jolt or stroke: also he may alter that World as\r\noften as he pleases, or change it from a Natural World, to an\r\nArtificial; he may make a World of Ideas, a World of Atoms, a World of\r\nLights, or whatsoever his Fancy leads him to. And since it is in your\r\npower to create such a World, What need you to venture life, reputation\r\nand tranquility, to conquer a gross material World? For you can enjoy no\r\nmore of a material world then a particular Creature is able to enjoy,\r\nwhich is but a small part, considering the compass of such a world; and\r\nyou may plainly observe it by your friend the Empress here, which\r\nalthough she possesses a whole World, yet enjoys she but a part thereof;\r\nneither is she so much acquainted with it, that she know all the places,\r\nCountries, and Dominions she Governs. The truth is, a soveraign Monarch\r\nhas the general trouble; but the Subjects enjoy all the delights and\r\npleasures in parts, for it is impossible, that a Kingdom, nay, a\r\nCountry, should be injoyed by one person at once, except he take the\r\npains to travel into every part, and endure the inconveniencies of going\r\nfrom one place to another? wherefore, since glory, delight, and pleasure\r\nlives but in other mens opinions, and can neither add tranquility to\r\nyour mind nor give ease to your body, Why should you desire to be\r\nEmpress of a Material World, and be troubled with the cares that attend\r\nGovernment? when as by creating a World within your self, you may enjoy\r\nall both in whole and in parts, without controle or opposition; and may\r\nmake what World you please, and alter it when you please, and enjoy as\r\nmuch pleasure and delight as a World can afford you? You have converted\r\nme, said the Duchess to the Spirits, from my ambitious desire;\r\nwherefore, I'le take your advice, reject and despise all the Worlds\r\nwithout me, and create a World of my own. The Empress said, If I do make\r\nsuch a world, then I shall be Mistress of two Worlds, one within, and\r\nthe other without me. That your Majesty may, said the Spirits; and so\r\nleft these two Ladies to create two Worlds within themselves: who did\r\nalso part from each other, until such time as they had brought their\r\nWorlds to perfection. The Duchess of Newcastle was most earnest and\r\nindustrious to make her World, because she had none at present; and\r\nfirst she resolved to frame it according to the opinion of Thales, but\r\nshe found her self so much troubled with Dæmons, that they would not\r\nsuffer her to take her own will, but forced her to obey their orders and\r\ncommands; which she being unwilling to do, left off from making a world\r\nthat way, and began to frame one according to Pythagoras's Doctrine; but\r\nin the Creation thereof, she was so puzled with numbers, how to order\r\nand compose the several parts, that she having no skill in Arithmetick,\r\nwas forced also to desist from the making of that World. Then she\r\nintended to create a World according to the opinion of Plato; but she\r\nfound more trouble and difficulty in that, then in the two former; for\r\nthe numerous Idea's having no other motion but what was derived from her\r\nmind, whence they did flow and issue out, made it a far harder business\r\nto her, to impart motion to them, then Puppit-players have in giving\r\nmotion to every several Puppit; in so much, that her patience was not\r\nable to endure the trouble which those Ideas caused her; wherefore she\r\nannihilated also that World, and was resolved to make one according to\r\nthe Opinion of Epicurus; which she had no sooner begun, but the infinite\r\nAtoms made such a mist, that it quite blinded the perception of her\r\nmind; neither was she able to make a Vacuum as a receptacle for those\r\nAtoms, or a place which they might retire into; so that partly for the\r\nwant of it, and of a good order and method, the confusion of those Atoms\r\nproduced such strange and monstrous figures, as did more affright then\r\ndelight her, and caused such a Chaos in her mind, as had almost\r\ndissolved it. At last, having with much ado cleansed and cleared her\r\nmind of these dusty and misty particles, she endeavored to create a\r\nWorld according to Aristotle's Opinion; but remembring that her mind, as\r\nmost of the Learned hold it, was Immaterial, and that, according to\r\nAristotle's Principle, out of Nothing, Nothing could be made; she was\r\nforced also to desist from that work, and then she fully resolved, not\r\nto take any more patterns from the Ancient Philosophers, but to follow\r\nthe Opinions of the Moderns; and to that end, she endeavoured to make a\r\nWorld according to Des Cartes Opinion; but when she had made the\r\nÆthereal Globules, and set them a moving by a strong and lively\r\nimagination, her mind became so dizzie with their extraordinary swift\r\nturning round, that it almost put her into a swoon; for her thoughts,\r\nbut their constant tottering, did so stagger, as if they had all been\r\ndrunk: wherefore she dissolved that World, and began to make another,\r\naccording to Hobbs's Opinion; but when all the parts of this Imaginary\r\nWorld came to press and drive each other, they seemed like a company of\r\nWolves that worry sheep, or like so many Dogs that hunt after Hares; and\r\nwhen she found a re-action equal to those pressures, her mind was so\r\nsqueezed together, that her thoughts could neither move forward nor\r\nbackward, which caused such an horrible pain in her head, that although\r\nshe had dissolved that World, yet she could not, without much\r\ndifficulty, settle her mind, and free it from that pain which those\r\npressures and reactions had caused in it.\r\n\r\nAt last, when the Duchess saw that no patterns would do her any good in\r\nthe framing of her World; she was resolved to make a World of her own\r\nInvention, and this World was composed of sensitive and rational\r\nself-moving Matter; indeed, it was composed onely of the Rational, which\r\nis the subtilest and purest degree of Matter; for as the Sensitive did\r\nmove and act both to the perceptions and consistency of the body, so\r\nthis degree of Matter at the same point of time (for though the degrees\r\nare mixt, yet the several parts may move several ways at one time) did\r\nmove to the Creation of the Imaginary World; which World after it was\r\nmade, appear'd so curious and full of variety, so well order'd and\r\nwisely govern'd, that it cannot possibly be expressed by words, nor the\r\ndelight and pleasure which the Duchess took in making this World-of-her-own.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the Empress was also making and dissolving several\r\nWorlds in her own mind, and was so puzled, that she could not settle in\r\nany of them; wherefore she sent for the Duchess, who being ready to wait\r\non the Empress, carried her beloved World along with her, and invited\r\nthe Empress's Soul to observe the Frame, Order and Government of it. Her\r\nMajesty was so ravished with the perception of it, that her Soul desired\r\nto live in the Duchess's World: But the Duchess advised her to make such\r\nanother World in her own mind; for, said she, your Majesty's mind is\r\nfull of rational corporeal motions; and the rational motions of my mind\r\nshall assist you by the help of sensitive expressions, with the best\r\nInstructions they are able to give you.\r\n\r\nThe Empress being thus perswaded by the Duchess to make an imaginary\r\nWorld of her own, followed her advice; and after she had quite finished\r\nit, and framed all kinds of Creatures proper and useful for it,\r\nstrengthened it with good Laws, and beautified it with Arts and\r\nSciences; having nothing else to do, unless she did dissolve her\r\nImaginary World, or made some alterations in the Blazing-World, she\r\nlived in; which yet she could hardly do, by reason it was so well\r\nordered that it could not be mended; for it was governed without secret\r\nand deceiving Policy; neither was there any ambitious, factions,\r\nmalicious detractions, civil dissentions, or home-bred quarrels,\r\ndivisions in Religion, Foreign Wars, &c. but all the people lived in a\r\npeaceful society, united Tranquility, and Religious Conformity. she was\r\ndesirious to see the World the Duchess came from, and observe therein\r\nthe several sovereign Governments, Laws and Customs of several Nations.\r\nThe Duchess used all the means she could, to divert her from that\r\nJourney, telling her, that the World she came from, was very much\r\ndisturbed with Factions, Divisions and Wars; but the Empress would not\r\nbe perswaded from her design; and lest the Emperor, or any of his\r\nsubjects should know of her travel, and obstruct her design; she sent\r\nfor some of the Spirits she had formerly conversed withal, and inquired\r\nwhether none of them could supply the place of her soul in her body at\r\nsuch a time, when she was gone to travel into another World? They\r\nanswered, Yes, they could; for not onely one, said they, but many\r\nSpirits may enter into your body, if you please. The Empress replied,\r\nshe desired but one Spirit to be Vice-Roy of her body in the absence of\r\nher Soul, but it must be an honest and ingenious Spirit; and if it was\r\npossible, a female Spirit. The Spirits told her, that there was no\r\ndifference of Sexes amongst them; but, said they, we will chuse an\r\nhonest and ingenious Spirit, and such a one as shall so resemble your\r\nsoul, that neither the Emperor, nor any of his Subjects, although the\r\nmost Divine, shall know whether it be your own soul, or not: which the\r\nEmpress was very glad at, and after the Spirits were gone, asked the\r\nDuchess, how her body was supplied in the absence of her soul? who\r\nanswered Her Majesty, That her body, in the absence of her soul, was\r\ngoverned by her sensitive and rational corporeal motions. Thus those two\r\nFemale Souls travelled together as lightly as two thoughts into the\r\nDuchess her native World; and, which is remarkable, in a moment viewed\r\nall the parts of it, and all the actions of all the Creatures therein,\r\nespecially did the Empress's Soul take much notice of the several\r\nactions of humane Creatures in all the several Nations and parts of that\r\nWorld, and wonder'd that for all there were so many several Nations,\r\nGovernments, Laws, Religions, Opinions, &c. they should all yet so\r\ngenerally agree in being Ambitious, Proud, Self-conceited, Vain,\r\nProdigal, Deceitful, Envious, Malicious, Unjust, Revengeful,\r\nIrreligious, Factious, &c. she did also admire, that not any particular\r\nState, Kingdom or Common-wealth, was contented with their own shares,\r\nbut endeavoured to encroach upon their Neighbours, and that their\r\ngreatest glory was in Plunder and Slaughter, and yet their victory's\r\nless then their expences, and their losses more than their gains; but\r\ntheir being overcome, in a manner their utter ruine: But that she\r\nwonder'd most at, was, that they should prize or value dirt more then\r\nmens lives, and vanity more then tranquility: for the Emperor of a\r\nworld, said she, injoys but a part, not the whole; so that his pleasure\r\nconsists in the Opinions of others. It is strange to me, answered the\r\nDuchess, that you should say thus, being your self, an Empress of a\r\nWorld; and not onely of a world, but of a peaceable, quiet, and obedient\r\nworld. 'Tis true, replied the Empress: but although it is a peaceable\r\nand obedient world, yet the Government thereof is rather a trouble, then\r\na pleasure; for order cannot be without industry, contrivance, and\r\ndirection: besides, the Magnificent state, that great Princes keep or\r\nought to keep, is troublesome. Then by your Majestie's discourse, said\r\nthe Duchess, I perceive that the greatest happiness in all the Worlds\r\nconsist in Moderation: No doubt of it, replied the Empress; and after\r\nthese two souls had visited all the several places, Congregations and\r\nAssemblies both in Religion and State, the several Courts of Judicature\r\nand the like, in several Nations, the Empress said, That of all the\r\nMonarchs of the several parts of the World, she had observed the\r\nGrand-Seignior was the greatest; for his word was a Law, and his power\r\nabsolute. But the Duchess pray'd the Empress to pardon her that she was\r\nof another mind; for, said she, he cannot alter Mahomets Laws and\r\nReligion; so that the Law and Church do govern the Emperor, and not the\r\nEmperor them. But, replied the Empress, he has power in some\r\nparticulars; as for example, To place and displace Subjects in their\r\nparticular Governments of Church and State; and having that, he has the\r\nCommand both over Church and State, and none dares oppose him. 'Tis\r\ntrue, said the Duchess; but if it pleases your Majesty, we will go into\r\nthat part of the World whence I came to wait on your Majesty, and there\r\nyou shall see as powerful a Monarch as the Grand Signior; for though his\r\nDominions are not of so large extent, yet they are much stronger, his\r\nLaws are easie and safe, and he governs so justly and wisely, that his\r\nSubjects are the happiest people of all the Nations or parts of that\r\nWorld. This Monarch, said the Empress, I have a great mind to see. Then\r\nthey both went, and in a short time arrived into his Dominions; but\r\ncoming into the Metropolitan City, the Empress's Soul observed many\r\nGallants go into an House; and enquiring of the Duchess's Soul, what\r\nHouse that was? she told her, It was one of the Theatres where Comedies\r\nand Tragedies were acted. The Empress asked, Whether they were real? No,\r\nsaid the Duchess, they are feigned. Then the Empress desired to enter\r\ninto the Theatre; and when she had seen the Play that was asked, the\r\nDuchess asked her how she liked that Recreation? I like it very well,\r\nsaid the Empress; but I observe that the Actors make a better show than\r\nthe Spectators; and the Scenes a better than the Actors and the Musick\r\nand Dancing is more pleasant and acceptable than the Play it self; for I\r\nsee, the Scenes stand for Wit, the Dancing for Humour, and the Musick is\r\nthe Chorus. I am sorry, replied the Duchess, to hear your Majesty say\r\nso; for if the Wits of this part of the World should hear you, they\r\nwould condemn you. What, said the Empress, would they condemn me for\r\npreferring a natural Face before a Sign-post; or a natural Humour before\r\nan artificial Dance; or Musick before a true and profitable Relation? As\r\nfor Relation, replied the Duchess, our Poets defie and condemn it into a\r\nChimney-corner, fitter for old Womens Tales, than Theatres. Why, said\r\nthe Empress do not your Poets Actions comply with their Judgments? For\r\ntheir Plays are composed of old Stories, either of Greek or Roman, or\r\nsome new-found World. The Duchess answered Her Majesty, That it was\r\ntrue, that all or most of their Plays were taken out of old Stories; but\r\nyet they had new Actions, which being joined to old Stories, together\r\nwith the addition of new Prologues, Scenes, Musick and Dancing, made new\r\nPlays.\r\n\r\nAfter this, both the Souls went to the Court, where all the Royal Family\r\nwas together, attended by the chief of the Nobles of their Dominions,\r\nwhich made a very magnificent Show; and when the Soul of the Empress\r\nviewed the King and Queen, she seemed to be in a maze, which the\r\nDuchess's Soul perceiving, asked the Empress how she liked the King, the\r\nQueen, and all the Royal Race? she answered, that in all the Monarchs\r\nshe had seen in that World, she had not found so much Majesty and\r\nAffability mixt so exactly together, that none did overshadow or eclipse\r\nthe other; and as for the Queen, she said that Vertue sat Triumphant in\r\nher face, and Piety was dwelling in her heart; and that all the Royal\r\nFamily seem'd to be endued with a Divine splendor: but when she had\r\nheard the King discourse, she believ'd that Mercury and Apollo had been\r\nhis Cœlestial Instructors; and, my dear Lord and Husband, added the\r\nDuchess, has been his Earthly Governor. But after some short stay in the\r\nCourt, the Duchess's soul grew very Melancholy; the Empress asking the\r\ncause of her sadness? she told her, That she had an extreme desire to\r\nconverse with the soul of her Noble Lord and dear Husband, and that she\r\nwas inpatient of a longer stay. The Empress desired the Duchess to have\r\nbut patience so long, until the King, the Queen, and the Royal Family\r\nwere retired, and then she would bear her Company to her Lord and\r\nHusband's Soul, who at that time lived in the Country some 112 miles\r\noff; which she did: and thus these two souls went towards those parts of\r\nthe Kingdom where the Duke of Newcastle was.\r\n\r\nBut one thing I forgot all this while, which is, That although thoughts\r\nare the natural language of Souls; yet by reason Souls cannot travel\r\nwithout Vehicles, they use such language as the nature and propriety of\r\ntheir Vehicles require, and the Vehicles of those two souls being made\r\nof the purest and finest sort of air, and of a human shape: This purity\r\nand fineness was the cause that they could neither be seen nor heard by\r\nany human Creature; when as, had they been of some grosser sort of Air,\r\nthe sound of the Air's language would have been as perceptible as the\r\nblowing of Zephyrus.\r\n\r\nAnd now to return to my former Story; when the Empress's and Duchess's\r\nSoul were travelling into Nottinghamshire, (for that was the place where\r\nthe Duke did reside) passing through the Forrest of sherewood, the\r\nEmpress's Soul was very much delighted with it, as being a dry, plain\r\nand woody place, very pleasant to travel in, both in Winter and Summer;\r\nfor it is neither much dirty nor dusty at no time: At last they arrived\r\nat Welbeck, a House where the Duke dwell'd, surrounded all with Wood, so\r\nclose and full, that the Empress took great pleasure and delight\r\ntherein, and told the Duchess she never had observed more Wood in so\r\nlittle compass in any part of the Kingdom she had passed through. The\r\ntruth is, said she, there seems to be more Wood on the Seas (she meaning\r\nthe Ships) than on the Land. The Duchess told her, The reason was, that\r\nthere had been a long Civil Warr in that Kingdom, in which most of the\r\nbest Timber-trees and Principal Palaces were ruined and destroyed; and\r\nmy dear Lord and Husband, said she, has lost by it half his Woods,\r\nbesides many Houses, Land, and movable Goods; so that all the loss out\r\nof his particular Estate, did amount to above Half a Million of Pounds.\r\nI wish, said the Empress, he had some of the Gold that is in the\r\nBlazing-World, to repair his losses. The Duchess most humbly thank'd her\r\nImperial Majesty for her kind wishes; but, said she, Wishes will not\r\nrepair his ruins: however, God has given my Noble Lord and Husband great\r\nPatience, by which he bears all his losses and misfortunes. As last they\r\nenter'd into the Duke's House, an Habitation not so magnificent as\r\nuseful; and when the Empress saw it, Has the Duke, said she, no other\r\nHouse but this? Yes, answered the Duchess, some five miles from this\r\nplace he has a very fine Castle called Bolesover. That place, then, said\r\nthe Empress, I desire to see. Alas, replied the Duchess, it is but a\r\nnaked House, and uncloath'd of all Furniture. However, said the Empress,\r\nI may see the manner of its structure and building. That you may,\r\nreplied the Duchess, and as they were thus discoursing, the Duke came\r\nout of the House into the Court, to see his Horses of Manage; whom when\r\nthe Duchess's Soul perceived, she was so overjoyed, that her Aereal\r\nVehicle became so splendorous, as if it had been enlightned by the Sun;\r\nby which we may perceive, that the passions of Souls or Spirits can\r\nalter their bodily Vehicles. Then these two Ladies Spirits went close to\r\nhim, but he could not perceive them; and after the Empress had observed\r\nthat Art of Mannage, she was much pleased with it, and commended it as a\r\nnoble pastime, and an exercise fit and proper for noble and heroick\r\nPersons. But when the Duke was gone into the house again, those two\r\nSouls followed him; where the Empress observing, that he went to the\r\nexercise of the sword, and was such an excellent and unparallel'd Master\r\nthereof, she was as much pleased with that exercise, as she was with the\r\nformer: But the Duchess's Soul being troubled, that her dear Lord and\r\nHusband used such a violent exercise before meat, for fear of\r\noverheating himself, without any consideration of the Empress's Soul,\r\nleft her Æreal Vehicle, and entred into her Lord. The Empress's Soul\r\nperceiving this, did the like: And then the Duke had three Souls in one\r\nBody; and had there been some such Souls more, the Duke would have been\r\nlike the Grand-Signior in his Seraglio, onely it would have been a\r\nPlatonick Seraglio. But the Duke's Soul being wise, honest, witty,\r\ncomplaisant and noble, afforded such delight and pleasure to the\r\nEmpress's Soul by his conversation, that these two souls became\r\nenamoured of each other; which the Duchess's soul perceiving, grew\r\njealous at first, but then considering that no Adultery could be\r\ncommitted amongst Platonick Lovers, and that Platonism, was Divine, as\r\nbeing derived from Divine Plato, cast forth of her mind that Idea of\r\nJealousie. Then the Conversation of these three souls was so pleasant,\r\nthat it cannot be expressed; for the Duke's Soul entertained the\r\nEmpress's Soul with Scenes, songs, Musick, witty Discourses, pleasant\r\nRecreations, and all kinds of harmless sports, so that the time passed\r\naway faster than they expected. At last a Spirit came and told the\r\nEmpress, That although neither the Emperor nor any of his Subjects knew\r\nthat her Soul was absent; yet the Emperor's Soul was so sad and\r\nmelancholy for want of His own beloved Soul, that all the Imperial Court\r\ntook notice of it. Wherefore he advised the Empress's Soul to return\r\ninto the Blazing-World, into her own Body she left there; which both the\r\nDuke's and Duchess's Soul was very sorry for, and wished that, if it had\r\nbeen possible, the Empress's Soul might have stayed a longer time with\r\nthem; but seeing it could not be otherwise, they pacified themselves.\r\nBut before the Empress returned into the Blazing-World, the Duchess\r\ndesired a Favour of her, to wit, That she would be pleased to make an\r\nAgreement between her Noble Lord, and Fortune. Why, said the Empress,\r\nare they Enemies? Yes, answered the Duchess, and they have been so ever\r\nsince I have been his Wife: nay, I have heard my Lord say, That she hath\r\ncrossed him in all things, ever since he could remember. I am sorry for\r\nthat, replied the Empress; but I cannot discourse with Fortune, without\r\nthe help of an Immaterial Spirit, and that cannot be done in this World;\r\nfor I have no Fly nor Bird-men here, to send into the Region of the Air,\r\nwhere, for the most part, their Habitations are. The Duchess said, she\r\nwould entreat her Lord to send an Attorney or Lawyer to plead his Cause.\r\nFortune will bribe them, replied the Empress, and so the Duke may chance\r\nto be cast: Wherefore the best way will be, for the Duke to chuse a\r\nFriend on his side, and let Fortune chuse another, and try whether by\r\nthis means it be possible to compose the Difference. The Duchess said,\r\nThey will never come to an agreement, unless there be a Judg or Umpire\r\nto decide the Case. A Judg, replied the Empress, is easie to be had; but\r\nto get an Impartial Judg, is a thing so difficult, that I doubt we shall\r\nhardly find one; for there is none to be had, neither in Nature, nor in\r\nHell, but onely from Heaven; and how to get such a Divine and Celestial\r\nJudg, I cannot tell: Nevertheless, if you will go along with me into the\r\nBlazing-World, I'le try what may be done. 'Tis my duty, said the\r\nDuchess, to wait on your Majesty, and I shall most willingly do it, for\r\nI have no other interest to consider. Then the Duchess spake to the Duke\r\nconcerning the difference between him and Fortune, and how it was her\r\ndesire that they might be friends. The Duke answered, That for his part\r\nhe had always with great industry sought her friendship, but as yet he\r\ncould never obtain it, for she had always been his Enemy. However, said\r\nhe, I'le try and send my two Friends, Prudence and Honesty, to plead my\r\nCause. Then these two Friends went with the Duchess and the Empress into\r\nthe Blazing-World; (for it is to be observed, that they are somewhat\r\nlike Spirits, because they are Immaterial, although their actions are\r\ncorporeal:) and after their arrival there, when the Empress had\r\nrefreshed her self, and rejoiced with the Emperor, she sent her Fly-men\r\nfor some of the Spirits, and desired their assistance, to compose the\r\ndifference between Fortune, and the Duke of Newcastle. But they told her\r\nMajesty, That Fortune was so inconstant, that although she would perhaps\r\npromise to hear their Cause pleaded, yet it was a thousand to one,\r\nwhether she would ever have the patience to do it: Nevertheless, upon\r\nHer Majestie's request, they tried their utmost, and at last prevailed\r\nwith Fortune so far, that she chose Folly and Rashness, for her Friends,\r\nbut they could not agree in chusing a Judg; until at last, with much\r\nado, they concluded, that Truth should hear, and decide the cause. Thus\r\nall being prepared, and the time appointed, both the Empress and\r\nDuchess's Soul went to hear them plead; and when all the Immaterial\r\nCompany was met, Fortune standing upon a Golden-Globe, made this\r\nfollowing Speech:\r\n\r\nNoble Friends, We are met here to hear a Cause pleaded concerning the\r\ndifference between the Duke of Newcastle, and my self; and though I am\r\nwilling upon the perswasions of the Ambassadors of the Empress, the\r\nImmaterial Spirits, to yield to it, yet it had been fit, the Duke's Soul\r\nshould be present also, to speak for her self; but since she is not\r\nhere, I shall declare my self to his Wife, and his Friends, as also to\r\nmy Friends, especially the Empress, to whom I shall chiefly direct my\r\nSpeech. First, I desire your Imperial Majesty may know, that this Duke\r\nwho complains or exclaims so much against me, hath been always my enemy;\r\nfor he has preferred Honesty and Prudence before me, and slighted all my\r\nfavours; nay, not onely thus, but he did fight against me, and preferred\r\nhis Innocence before my Power. His Friends Honesty and Prudence, said he\r\nmost scornfully, are more to be regarded, than Inconstant Fortune, who\r\nis onely a friend to Fools and Knaves; for which neglect and scorn,\r\nwhether I have not just reason to be his enemy, your Majesty may judg\r\nyour self.\r\n\r\nAfter Fortune had thus ended her Speech, the Duchess's Soul rose from\r\nher seat, and spake to the Immaterial Assembly in this manner:\r\n\r\nNoble Friends, I think it fit, by your leave, to answer Lady Fortune in\r\nthe behalf of my Noble Lord and Husband, since he is not here himself;\r\nand since you have heard her complaint concerning the choice my Lord\r\nmade of his Friends, and the neglect and disrespect he seemed to cast\r\nupon her; give me leave to answer, that, first concerning the Choice of\r\nhis Friends, He has proved himself a wise man in it; and as for the\r\ndisrespect and rudeness her Ladiship accuses him of, I dare say he is so\r\nmuch a Gentleman, that I am confident he would never slight, scorn or\r\ndisrespect any of the Female Sex in all his life time; but was such a\r\nservant and Champion for them, that he ventured Life and Estate in their\r\nservice; but being of an honest, as well as an honourable Nature, he\r\ncould not trust Fortune with that which he preferred above his life,\r\nwhich was his Reputation, by reason Fortune did not side with those that\r\nwere honest and honourable, but renounced them; and since he could not\r\nbe of both sides, he chose to be of that which was agreeable both to his\r\nConscience, Nature and Education; for which choice Fortune did not onely\r\ndeclare her self his open Enemy, but fought with him in several Battels;\r\nnay, many times, hand to hand; at last, she being a Powerful Princess,\r\nand as some believe, a Deity, overcame him, and cast him into a\r\nBanishment, where she kept him in great misery, ruined his Estate, and\r\ntook away from him most of his Friends; nay, even when she favoured many\r\nthat were against her, she still frowned on him; all which he endured\r\nwith the greatest patience, and with that respect to Lady Fortune, that\r\nhe did never in the least endeavour to disoblige any of her Favourites,\r\nbut was onely sorry that he, an honest man, could find no favor in her\r\nCourt; and since he did never injure any of those she favoured, he\r\nneither was an enemy to her Ladiship, but gave her always that respect\r\nand worship which belonged to her power and dignity, and is still ready\r\nat any time honestly and prudently to serve her; he onely begs, her\r\nLadiship would be his friend for the future, as she hath been his enemy\r\nin times past.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Duchess's Speech was ended, Folly and Rashness started\r\nup, and both spake so thick and fast at once, that not onely the\r\nAssembly, but themselves were not able to understand each other: At\r\nwhich Fortune was somewhat out of countenance; and commanded them either\r\nto speak singly, or be silent: But Prudence told her Ladiship, she\r\nshould command them to speak wisely, as well as singly; otherwise, said\r\nshe, it were best for them not to speak at all: Which Fortune resented\r\nvery ill, and told Prudence, she was too bold; and then commanded Folly\r\nto declare what she would have made known: but her Speech was so\r\nfoolish, mixt with such Non-sense, that none knew what to make of it;\r\nbesides, it was so tedious, that Fortune bid her to be silent; and\r\ncommanded Rashness to speak for her, who began after this manner:\r\n\r\nGreat Fortune; The Duchess of Newcastle has proved her self, according\r\nto report, a very Proud and Ambitious Lady, in presuming to answer you\r\nher own self, in this noble Assembly without your Command, in a Speech\r\nwherein she did not onely contradict you, but preferred Honesty and\r\nPrudence before you; saying, That her Lord was ready to serve you\r\nhonestly and prudently; which presumption is beyond all pardon; and if\r\nyou allow Honesty and Prudence to be above you, none will admire,\r\nworship, or serve you; but you'l be forced to serve your self, and will\r\nbe despised, neglected and scorned by all; and from a Deity, become a\r\nmiserable, dirty, begging mortal in a Church-yard-Porch, or Noble-man's\r\nGate: Wherefore to prevent such disasters, fling as many misfortunes and\r\nneglects on the Duke and Duchess of Newcastle, and their two friends, as\r\nyour power is able to do; otherwise Prudence and Honesty will be the\r\nchief and onely Moral Deities of Mortals.\r\n\r\nRashness having thus ended her Speech, Prudence rose and declared her\r\nself in this manner:\r\n\r\nBeautiful Truth, Great Fortune, and you the rest of my noble Friends; I\r\nam come a great and long journey in the behalf of my dear Friend the\r\nDuke of Newcastle; not to make more wounds, but, if it be possible, to\r\nheal those that are made already. Neither do I presume to be a Deity;\r\nbut my onely request is, that you would be pleased to accept of my\r\nOffering, I being an humble and devout supplicant; and since no offering\r\nis more acceptable to the Gods, then the offering of Peace; in order to\r\nthat, I desire to make an agreement between Fortune, and the Duke of\r\nNewcastle.\r\n\r\nThus she spake, and as she was going up, up started Honesty (for she has\r\nnot always so much discretion as she ought to have) and interrupted\r\nPrudence.\r\n\r\nI came not here, said she, to hear Fortune flattered, but to hear the\r\nCause decided between Fortune and the Duke; neither came I hither to\r\nspeak Rhetorically and Eloquently, but to propound the case plainly and\r\ntruly; and I'le have you know, that the Duke, whose Cause we argue, was\r\nand is my Foster-son; for I Honesty bred him from his Childhood, and\r\nmade a perpetual friendship betwixt him and Gratitude, Charity and\r\nGenerosity; and put him to School to Prudence, who taught him Wisdom,\r\nand informed him in the Rules of Temperance, Patience, Justice, and the\r\nlike; then I put him into the University of Honour, where he learned all\r\nHonourable Qualities, Arts, and Sciences; afterward I sent him to travel\r\nthrough the World of Actions, and made Observation his Governor; and in\r\nthose his travels, he contracted a friendship with Experience; all\r\nwhich, made him fit for Heavens Blessings, and Fortunes Favours: But she\r\nhating all those that have merit and desert, became his inveterate\r\nEnemy, doing him all the mischief she could, until the God of Justice\r\nopposed Fortune's Malice, and pull'd him out of those ruines she had\r\ncast upon him: For this God's Favourites were the Dukes Champions;\r\nwherefore to be an Enemy to him, were to be an Enemy to the God of\r\nJustice: In short, the true cause of Fortunes Malice to this Duke is,\r\nthat he would never flatter her; for I Honesty, did command him not to\r\ndo it, or else he would be forced to follow all her inconstant ways, and\r\nobey all her unjust commands, which would cause a great reproach to him:\r\nbut, on the other side, Prudence advised him not to despise Fortune's\r\nfavours, for that would be an obstrustion and hinderance to his worth\r\nand merit; and He to obey both our advice and counsels, did neither\r\nflatter nor despise Her; but was always humble and respectful to her so\r\nfar as Honour, Honesty and Conscience would permit: all which I refer to\r\nTruth's Judgment, and expect her final Sentence.\r\n\r\nFortune hearing thus Honesty's plain Speech, thought it very rude, and\r\nwould not hearken to Truth's Judgment, but went away in a Passion: At\r\nwhich, both the Empress and Duchess were extreamly troubled, that their\r\nendeavours should have no better effect: but Honesty chid the Duchess,\r\nand said, she was to be punished for desiring so much Fortune's favours;\r\nfor it appears, said she, that you mistrust the gods blessings: At which\r\nthe Duchess wept, answering Honesty, That she did neither mistrust the\r\ngods blessings, nor relye upon Fortune's favours; but desired onely that\r\nher Lord might have no potent Enemies. The Empress being much troubled\r\nto see her weep, told Honesty in anger, she wanted the discretion of\r\nPrudence; for though you are commended, said she, yet you are apt to\r\ncommit many indiscreet actions, unless Prudence be your guide. At which\r\nreproof Prudence smiled, and Honesty was somewhat out of countenance;\r\nbut they soon became very good friends: and after the Duchess's Soul had\r\nstayed some time with the Empress in the Blazing-World, she begg'd leave\r\nof her to return to her Lord and Husband; which the Empress granted her,\r\nupon condition she should come and visit her as often as conveniently\r\nshe could, promising that she would do the same to the Duchess.\r\n\r\nThus the Duchess's soul, after she had taken her leave of the Empress,\r\nas also of the Spirits, who with great civility, promised her, that they\r\nwould endeavour in time to make a Peace and Agreement between Fortune\r\nand the Duke, returned with Prudence and Honesty, into her own World:\r\nBut when she was just upon her departure, the Empress sent to Her, and\r\ndesired that she might yet have some little conference with her before\r\nshe went; which the Duchess most willingly granted her Majesty; and when\r\nshe came to wait on her, the Empress told the Duchess, That she being\r\nher dear Platonick Friend, of whose just and Impartial Judgment, she had\r\nalwayes a very great esteem; could not forbear, before she went from\r\nher, to ask her Advice concerning the Government of the Blazing-World:\r\nFor, said she, although this World was very well and wisely ordered and\r\ngoverned at first, when I came to be Empress thereof; yet the nature of\r\nWomen being much delighted with Change and Variety, after I had received\r\nan absolute Power from the Emperor, did somewhat alter the Form of\r\nGovernment from what I found it; but now perceiving that the World is\r\nnot so quiet as it was at first, I am much troubled at it; especially\r\nthere are such continual Contentions and Divisions between the Worm-\r\nBear- and Fly-men, the Ape-men, the Satyrs, the Spider-men, and all\r\nothers of such sorts, that I fear they'l break out into an open\r\nRebellion, and cause a great disorder; and the ruin of the Government;\r\nand therefore I desire your advice and assistance, how I may order it to\r\nthe best advantage, that this World may be rendred peaceable, quiet and\r\nhappy, as it was before. Whereupon the Duchess answered, That since she\r\nheard by her Imperial Majesty, how well and happily the World had been\r\ngoverned when she first came to be Empress thereof, she would advise her\r\nMajesty to introduce the same form of Government again, which had been\r\nbefore; that is, to have but one soveraign, one Religion, one Law, and\r\none Language, so that all the World might be but as one united Family,\r\nwithout divisions; nay, like God, and his Blessed Saints and Angels:\r\nOtherwise, said she, it may in time prove as unhappy, nay, as miserable\r\na World as that is from which I came, wherein are more soveraigns then\r\nWorlds, and more pretended Governours then Government, more Religions\r\nthen Gods, and more Opinions in those Religions then Truths; more Laws\r\nthen Rights, and more Bribes then Justices; more Policies then\r\nNecessities, and more Fears then Dangers; more Covetousness then Riches,\r\nmore Ambitions then Merits, more Services then Rewards, more Languages\r\nthen Wit, more Controversie then Knowledg, more Reports then noble\r\nActions, and more Gifts by partiality, then according to Merit; all\r\nwhich, said she, is a great misery, nay, a curse, which your blessed\r\nBlazing-World never knew, nor 'tis probable, will never know of, unless\r\nyour Imperial Majesty alter the Government thereof from what it was when\r\nyou began to govern it: And since your Majesty complains much of the\r\nfactions of the Bear- Fish- Fly- Ape- and Worm- men, the Satyrs,\r\nSpider-men, and the like, and of their perpetual disputes and quarrels,\r\nI would advise your Majesty to dissolve all their societies; for 'tis\r\nbetter to be without their intelligences, then to have an unquiet and\r\ndisorderly Government. The truth is, said she, wheresoever Learning is,\r\nthere is most commonly also Controversie and quarelling; for there be\r\nalways some that will know more, and be wiser then others: some think\r\ntheir Arguments come nearer to Truth, and are more rational then others;\r\nsome are so wedded to their own opinions, that they'l never yield to\r\nReason; and others, though they find their Opinions not firmly grounded\r\nupon Reason, yet, for fear of receiving some disgrace by altering them,\r\nwill nevertheless maintain them against all sense and reason, which must\r\nneeds breed factions in their Schools, which at last break out into open\r\nWars, and draw sometimes an utter ruin upon a State or Government. The\r\nEmpress told the Duchess, that she would willingly follow her advice;\r\nbut she thought it would be an eternal disgrace to her, to alter her own\r\nDecrees, Acts, and Laws. To which the Duchess answered, That it was so\r\nfar from a disgrace, as it would rather be for her Majesties eternal\r\nhonour, to return from a worse to a better, and would express and\r\ndeclare Her to be more then ordinary wise and good; so wise, as to\r\nperceive her own errors, and so good, as not to persist in them, which\r\nfew did: for which, said she, you will get a glorious fame in this\r\nWorld, and an Eternal Glory hereafter; and I shall pray for it so long\r\nas I live. Upon which Advice, the Empress's Soul embrac'd and kiss'd the\r\nDuchess's Soul with an Immaterial Kiss, and shed Immaterial Tears, that\r\nshe was forced to part from her, finding her not a flattering Parasite,\r\nbut a true Friend; and in truth, such was their Platonick Friendship, as\r\nthese two loving Souls did often meet and rejoice in each others\r\nConversation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Part of the Description of the New Blazing-World.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Empress having now ordered and setled her Government to the best\r\nadvantage and quiet of her Blazing-World, lived and reigned most happily\r\nand blessedly, and received oftentimes Visits from the Immaterial\r\nSpirits, who gave her Intelligence of all such things as she desired to\r\nknow, and they were able to inform her of: One time they told her, how\r\nthe World she came from, was imbroiled in a great War, and that most\r\nparts or Nations thereof made War against that Kingdom which was her\r\nNative Country, where all her Friends and Relations did live; at which\r\nthe Empress was extreamly troubled; insomuch that the Emperor perceived\r\nher grief by her tears, and examining the cause thereof, she told him\r\nthat she had received Intelligence from the Spirits, that that part of\r\nthe World she came from, which was her native Country, was like to be\r\ndestroyed by numerous Enemies that made War against it. The Emperor\r\nbeing very sensible of this ill news, especially of the Trouble it\r\ncaused to the Empress, endeavoured to comfort her as much as possibly he\r\ncould; and told her, that she might have all the assistance which the\r\nBlazing-World was able to afford. she answered, That if there were any\r\npossibility of transporting Forces out of the Blazing-World, into the\r\nWorld she came from, she would not fear so much the ruin thereof: but,\r\nsaid she, there being no probability of effecting anysuch thing, I know\r\nnot how to shew my readiness to serve my Native Country. The Emperor\r\nasked, Whether those Spirits that gave her Intelligence of this War,\r\ncould not with all their Power and Forces, assist her against those\r\nEnemies? she answered, That Spirits could not arm themselves, nor make\r\nany use of Artificial Arms or Weapons; for their Vehicles were Natural\r\nBodies, not Artificial: Besides, said she, the violent and strong\r\nactions of war, will never agree with Immaterial Spirits; for Immaterial\r\nSpirits cannot fight, nor make Trenches, Fortifications, and the like.\r\nBut, said the Emperor, their Vehicles can; especially if those Vehicles\r\nbe mens Bodies, they may be serviceable in all the actions of War. Alas,\r\nreplied the Empress, that will never do; for first, said she, it will be\r\ndifficult to get so many dead Bodies for their Vehicles, as to make up a\r\nwhole Army, much more to make many Armies to fight with so many several\r\nNations; nay, if this could be, yet it is not possible to get so many\r\ndead and undissolved Bodies in one Nation; and for transporting them out\r\nof other Nations, it would be a thing of great difficulty and\r\nimprobability: But put the case, said she, all these difficulties could\r\nbe overcome; yet there is one obstruction or hindrance which can no ways\r\nbe avoided: For although those dead and undissolved Bodies did all die\r\nin one minute of time; yet before they could Rendezvouze, and be put\r\ninto a posture of War, to make a great and formidable Army, they would\r\nstink and dissolve; and when they came to a fight, they would moulder\r\ninto dust and ashes, and so leave the purer Immaterial Spirits naked:\r\nnay, were it also possible, that those dead bodies could be preserved\r\nfrom stinking and dissolving, yet the Souls of such Bodies would not\r\nsuffer Immaterial Spirits to rule and order them, but they would enter\r\nand govern them themselves, as being the right owners thereof, which\r\nwould produce a War between those Immaterial Souls, and the Immaterial\r\nSpirits in Material Bodies; all which would hinder them from doing any\r\nservice in the actions of War, against the Enemies of my Native\r\nCountrey. You speak Reason, said the Emperor, and I wish with all my\r\nSoul I could advise any manner or way, that you might be able to assist\r\nit; but you having told me of your dear Platonick Friend the Duchess of\r\nNewcastle and of her good and profitable Counsels, I would desire you to\r\nsend for her Soul, and conferr with her about this business.\r\n\r\nThe Empress was very glad of this motion of the Emperor, and immediately\r\nsent for the Soul of the said Duchess, which in a minute waited on her\r\nMajesty. Then the Empress declared to her the grievance and sadness of\r\nher mind, and how much she was troubled and afflicted at the News\r\nbrought her by the Immaterial Spirits, desiring the Duchess, if\r\npossible, to assist her with the best Counsels she could, that she might\r\nshew the greatness of her love and affection which she bore to her\r\nNative Countrey. Whereupon the Duchess promised her Majesty to do what\r\nlay in her power; and since it was a business of great Importance, she\r\ndesired some time to consider of it; for, said she, Great Affairs\r\nrequire deep Considerations; which the Empress willingly allowed her.\r\nAnd after the Duchess had considered some little time, she desired the\r\nEmpress to send some of her Syrens or Mear men, to see what passages\r\nthey could find out of the Blazing-World, into the World she came from;\r\nfor, said she, if there be a passage for a Ship to come out of that\r\nWorld into this; then certainly there may also a Ship pass thorow the\r\nsame passage out of this World into that. Hereupon the Mear- or Fish-men\r\nwere sent out; who being many in number, employ'd all their industry,\r\nand did swim several ways; at last having found out the passage, they\r\nreturned to the Empress, and told her, That as their Blazing World had\r\nbut one Emperor, one Government, one Religion, and one Language, so\r\nthere was but one Passage into that World, which was so little, that no\r\nVessel bigger than a Packet-Boat could go thorow; neither was that\r\nPassage always open, but sometimes quite frozen up. At which Relation\r\nboth the Empress and Duchess seemed somewhat troubled, fearing that this\r\nwould perhaps be an hindrance or obstruction to their Design.\r\n\r\nAt last the Duchess desired the Empress to send for her Ship-wrights,\r\nand all her Architects, which were Giants; who being called, the Duchess\r\ntold them how some in her own World had been so ingenious, as to\r\ncontrive Ships that could swim under Water, and asked, Whether they\r\ncould do the like? The Giants answered, They had never heard of that\r\nInvention; nevertheless, they would try what might be done by Art, and\r\nspare no labour or industry to find it out. In the mean time, while both\r\nthe Empress and Duchess were in a serious Counsel, after many debates,\r\nthe Duchess desired but a few Ships to transport some of the Bird- Worm-\r\nand Bear- men: Alas! said the Empress, What can such sorts of Men do in\r\nthe other World? especially so few? They will be soon destroyed, for a\r\nMusket will destroy numbers of Birds in one shot. The Duchess said, I\r\ndesire your Majesty will have but a little patience, and relie upon my\r\nadvice, and you shall not fail to save your own Native Country, and in a\r\nmanner become a Mistress of all that World you came from. The Empress,\r\nwho loved the Duchess as her own Soul, did so; the Giants returned soon\r\nafter, and told her Majesty, that they had found out the Art which the\r\nDuchess had mentioned, to make such Ships as could swim under water;\r\nwhich the Empress and Duchess were both very glad at, and when the Ships\r\nwere made ready, the Duchess told the Empress, that it was requisite\r\nthat her Majesty should go her self in body, as well as in Soul; but I,\r\nsaid she, can onely wait on your Majesty after a Spiritual manner, that\r\nis, with my Soul. Your Soul, said the Empress, shall live with my Soul,\r\nin my Body; for I shall onely desire your Counsel and Advice. Then said\r\nthe Duchess, Your Majesty must command a great number of your Fish-men\r\nto wait on your Ships; for you know that your Ships are not made for\r\nCannons, and therefore are no ways serviceable in War; for though by the\r\nhelp of your Engines, they can drive on, and your Fish-men may by the\r\nhelp of Chains and Ropes, draw them which way they will, to make them go\r\non, or flye back, yet not so as to fight: And though your Ships be of\r\nGold, and cannot be shot thorow, but onely bruised and battered; yet the\r\nEnemy will assault and enter them, and take them as Prizes; wherefore\r\nyour Fish-men must do you Service instead of Cannons. But how, said the\r\nEmpress, can the Fish-men do me service against an Enemy, without\r\nCannons and all sorts of Arms? That is the reason, answered the Duchess,\r\nthat I would have numbers of Fish-men, for they shall destroy all your\r\nEnemies Ships, before they can come near you. The Empress asked in what\r\nmanner that could be? Thus, answered the Duchess: Your Majesty must send\r\na number of Worm-men to the Burning-Mountains (for you have good store\r\nof them in the Blazing-World) which must get a great quantity of the\r\nFire-stone, whose property, you know, is, that it burns so long as it is\r\nwet; and the Ships in the other World being all made of Wood, they may\r\nby that means set them all on fire; and if you can but destroy their\r\nShips, and hinder their Navigation, you will be Mistress of all that\r\nWorld, by reason most parts thereof cannot live without Navigation.\r\nBesides, said she, the Fire-stone will serve you instead of Light or\r\nTorches; for you know, that the World you are going into, is dark at\r\nnights (especially if there be no Moon-shine, or if the Moon be\r\novershadowed by Clouds) and not so full of Blazing-Stars as this World\r\nis, which make as great a light in the absence of the Sun, as the Sun\r\ndoth when it is present; for that World hath but little blinking Stars,\r\nwhich make more shadows then light, and are onely able to draw up\r\nVapours from the Earth, but not to rarifie or clarifie them, or to\r\nconvert them into serene air.\r\n\r\nThis Advice of the Duchess was very much approved; and joyfully embraced\r\nby the Empress, who forthwith sent her Worm-men to get a good quantity\r\nof the mentioned Fire-stone. she also commanded numbers of Fish-men to\r\nwait on her under Water, and Bird-men to wait on her in the Air; and\r\nBear- and Worm-men to wait on her in Ships, according to the Duchess's\r\nadvice; and indeed the Bear-men were as serviceable to her, as the North\r\nStar; but the Bird-men would often rest themselves upon the Deck of the\r\nShips; neither would the Empress, being of a sweet and noble Nature,\r\nsuffer that they should tire or weary themselves by long flights; for\r\nthough by Land they did often fly out of one Countrey into another, yet\r\nthey did rest in some Woods, or on some Grounds, especially at night,\r\nwhen it was their sleeping time: And therefore the Empress was forced to\r\ntake a great many Ships along with her, both for transporting those\r\nseveral sorts of her loyal and serviceable Subjects, and to carry\r\nprovisions for them: Besides, she was so wearied with the Petitions of\r\nseveral others of her Subjects who desired to wait on her Majesty, that\r\nshe could not possibly deny them all; for some would rather chuse to be\r\ndrowned, then not tender their duty to her.\r\n\r\nThus after all things were made fit and ready, the Empress began her\r\nJourney; I cannot properly say, she set Sail, by reason in some Part, as\r\nin the passage between the two Worlds (which yet was but short) the\r\nShips were drawn under water by the Fish-men with Golden Chains, so that\r\nthey had no need of Sails there, nor of any other Arts, but onely to\r\nkeep out water from entering into the Ships, and to give or make so much\r\nAir as would serve, for breath or respiration, those Land-Animals that\r\nwere in the Ships; which the Giants had so Artificially contrived, that\r\nthey which were therein, found no inconveniency at all: And after they\r\nhad passed the Icy Sea, the Golden Ships appeared above Water, and so\r\nwent on until they came near the Kingdom that was the Empress's Native\r\nCountrey; where the Bear-men through their Telescopes discovered a great\r\nnumber of Ships which had beset all that Kingdom, well rigg'd and mann'd.\r\n\r\nThe Empress before she came in sight of the Enemy, sent some of her\r\nFish- and Bird-men to bring her intelligence of their Fleet; and hearing\r\nof their number, their station and posture, she gave order that when it\r\nwas Night, her Bird-men should carry in their beeks some of the\r\nmentioned Fire-stones, with the tops thereof wetted; and the Fish-men\r\nshould carry them likewise, and hold them out of the Water; for they\r\nwere cut in the form of Torches or Candles, and being many thousands,\r\nmade a terrible shew; for it appear'd as if all the Air and Sea had been\r\nof a Flaming-Fire; and all that were upon the Sea, or near it, did\r\nverily believe, the time of Judgment, or the Last Day was come, which\r\nmade them all fall down, and Pray.\r\n\r\nAt the break of Day, the Empress commanded those Lights to be put out,\r\nand then the Naval Forces of the Enemy perceived nothing but a Number of\r\nShips without Sails, Guns, Arms, and other Instruments of War; which\r\nShips seemed to swim of themselves, without any help or assistance:\r\nwhich sight put them into a great amaze; neither could they perceive\r\nthat those Ships were of Gold, by reason the Empress had caused them all\r\nto be coloured black, or with a dark colour; so that the natural colour\r\nof the Gold could not be perceived through the artificial colour of the\r\npaint, no not by the best Telescopes. All which put the Enemies Fleet\r\ninto such a fright at night, and to such wonder in the morning, or at\r\nday-time, that they know not what to judg or make of them; for they know\r\nneither what Ships they were, nor what Party they belonged to, insomuch\r\nthat they had no power to stir.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, the Empress knowing the Colours of her own Country,\r\nsent a Letter to their General, and the rest of the chief Commanders, to\r\nlet them know, that she was a great and powerful Princess, and came to\r\nassist them against their Enemies: wherefore she desired they should\r\ndeclare themselves, when they would have her help and assistance.\r\n\r\nHereupon a Councel was called, and the business debated; but there were\r\nso many cross and different Opinions, that they could not suddenly\r\nresolve what answer to send the Empress; at which she grew angry,\r\ninsomuch that she resolved to return into her Blazing- World, without\r\ngiving any assistance to her Countrymen: but the Duchess of Newcastle\r\nintreated her Majesty to abate her passion; for, said she, Great\r\nCouncels are most commonly slow, because many men have many several\r\nOpinions: besides, every Councellor striving to be the wisest, makes\r\nlong speeches, and raise many doubts, which cause retardments. If I had\r\nlong-speeched Councellors, replied the Empress, I would hang them, by\r\nreason they give more Words, then Advice. The Duchess answered, That her\r\nMajesty should not be angry, but consider the differences of that and\r\nher Blazing-World; for, said she, they are not both alike; but there are\r\ngrosser and duller understandings in this, than in the Blazing-World.\r\n\r\nAt last a Messenger came out, who returned the Empress thanks for her\r\nkind proffer, but desired withal, to know from whence she came, and how,\r\nand in what manner her assistance could be serviceable to them? The\r\nEmpress answered, That she was not bound to tell them whence she came;\r\nbut as for the manner of her assistance, I will appear, said she, to\r\nyour Navy in a splendorous Light, surrounded with Fire. The Messenger\r\nasked at what time they should expect her coming? I'le be with you,\r\nanswered the Empress, about one of the Clock at night. With this report\r\nthe Messenger returned; which made both the poor Councellors and Sea-men\r\nmuch afraid; but yet they longed for the time to behold this strange sight.\r\n\r\nThe appointed hour being come, the Empress appear'd with Garments made\r\nof the Star-stone, and was born or supported above the Water, upon the\r\nFish- mens heads and backs, so that she seemed to walk upon the face of\r\nthe Water, and the Bird- and Fish-men carried the Fire-stone, lighted\r\nboth in the Air, and above the Waters.\r\n\r\nWhich sight, when her Country-men perceived at a distance, their hearts\r\nbegan to tremble; but coming something nearer, she left her Torches, and\r\nappeared onely in her Garments of Light, like an Angel, or some Deity,\r\nand all kneeled down before her, and worshipped her with all submission\r\nand reverence: But the Empress would not come nearer than at such a\r\ndistance where her voice might be generally heard, by reason she would\r\nnot have that any of her Accoustrements should be perceived, but the\r\nsplendor thereof; and when she was come so near that her voice could be\r\nheard and understood by all, she made this following Speech:\r\n\r\nDear Country-men, for so you are, although you know me not; I being a\r\nNative of this Kingdom, and hearing that most part of this World had\r\nresolved to make Warr against it, and sought to destroy it, at least to\r\nweaken its Naval Force and Power, have made a Voyage out of another\r\nWorld, to lend you my assistance against your Enemies. I come not to\r\nmake bargains with you, or to regard my own Interest more than your\r\nSafety; but I intend to make you the most powerful Nation of this World,\r\nand therefore I have chosen rather to quit my own Tranquility, Riches\r\nand Pleasure, than suffer you to be ruined and destroyed. All the Return\r\nI desire, is but your grateful acknowledgment, and to declare my Power,\r\nLove and Loyalty to my Native Country: for, although I am now a Great\r\nand Absolute Princess, and Empress of a whole World, yet I acknowledg,\r\nthat once I was a Subject of this Kingdom, which is but a small part of\r\nthis World; and therefore I will have you undoubtedly believe, that I\r\nshall destroy all your Enemies before this following Night, I mean those\r\nwhich trouble you by Sea; and if you have any by Land, assure your self\r\nI shall also give you my assistance against them, and make you triumph\r\nover all that seek your Ruine and Destruction.\r\n\r\nUpon this Declaration of the Empress, when both the General, and all the\r\nCommanders in their several Ships, had return'd their humble and hearty\r\nThanks to Her Majesty for so great a favour to them, she took her leave,\r\nand departed to her own Ships. But, good Lord! what several Opinions and\r\nJudgments did this produce in the minds of her Country-men! some said\r\nshe was an Angel; others, she was a sorceress; some believed her a\r\nGoddess; others said the Devil deluded them in the shape of a fine Lady.\r\n\r\nThe morning after, when the Navies were to fight, the Empress appear'd\r\nupon the face of the Waters, dress'd in her Imperial Robes, which were\r\nall of Diamonds and Carbuncles; in one hand she held a Buckler, made of\r\none intire Carbuncle; and in the other hand a Spear of one intire\r\nDiamond; on her head she had a Cap of Diamonds, and just upon the top of\r\nthe Crown, was a Starr made of the Starr-stone, mentioned heretofore;\r\nand a Half-Moon made of the same Stone, was placed on her forehead; all\r\nher other Garments were of several sorts of precious Jewels; and having\r\ngiven her Fish-men directions how to destroy the Enemies of her Native\r\nCountry, she proceeded to effect her design. The Fish-men were to carry\r\nthe Fire-stones in cases of Diamonds (for the Diamonds in the\r\nBlazing-World, are in splendor so far beyond the Diamonds of this World,\r\nas Peble-stones are to the best sort of this Worlds Diamonds) and to\r\nuncase or uncover those Fire-stones no sooner but when they were just\r\nunder the Enemis Ships, or close at their sides, and then to wet them,\r\nand set their Ships on fire; which was no sooner done, but all the\r\nEnemie's Fleet was of a Flaming fire; and coming to the place where the\r\nPowder was, it streight blew them up; so that all the several Navies of\r\nthe Enemies, were destroyed in a short time: which when her Countrymen\r\ndid see, they all cried out with one voice, That she was an Angel sent\r\nfrom God to deliver them out of the hands of their Enemies: Neither\r\nwould she return into the Blazing-World, until she had forced all the\r\nrest of the World to submit to that same Nation.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the General of all their Naval Forces, sent to their\r\nsoveraign to acquaint him with their miraculous Delivery and Conquest,\r\nand with the Empress's design of making him the most powerful Monarch of\r\nall that World. After a short time, the Empress sent her self, to the\r\nsoveraign of that Nation to know in what she could be serviceable to\r\nhim; who returning her many thanks, both for her assistance against his\r\nEnemies, and her kind proffer to do him further service for the good and\r\nbenefit of his Nations (for he was King over several Kingdoms) sent her\r\nword, that although she did partly destroy his Enemies by Sea, yet, they\r\nwere so powerful, that they did hinder the Trade and Traffick of his\r\nDominions. To which the Empress returned this answer, That she would\r\nburn and sink all those Ships that would not pay him Tribute; and\r\nforthwith sent to all the Neighbouring Nations, who had any Traffick by\r\nSea, desiring them to pay Tribute to the King and soveraign of that\r\nNation where she was born; But they denied it with great scorn.\r\nWhereupon, she immediately commanded her Fish-men, to destroy all\r\nstrangers Ships that traffick'd on the Seas; which they did according to\r\nthe Empress's Command; and when the Neighbouring Nations and Kingdoms\r\nperceived her power, they were so discomposed in their affairs and\r\ndesigns, that they knew not what to do: At last they sent to the\r\nEmpress, and desired to treat with her, but could get no other\r\nconditions then to submit and pay Tribute to the said King and soveraign\r\nof her Native Country, otherwise, she was resolved to ruin all their\r\nTrade and Traffick by burning their Ships. Long was this Treaty, but in\r\nfine, they could obtain nothing, so that at last they were inforced to\r\nsubmit; by which the King of the mentioned Nations became absolute\r\nMaster of the Seas, and consequently of that World; by reason, as I\r\nmentioned heretofore, the several Nations of that World could not well\r\nlive without Traffick and Commerce, by Sea, as well as by Land.\r\n\r\nBut after a short time, those Neighbouring Nations finding themselves so\r\nmuch inslaved, that they were hardly able to peep out of their own\r\nDominions without a chargeable Tribute, they all agreed to join again\r\ntheir Forces against the King and soveraign of the said Dominions; which\r\nwhen the Empress receiv'd notice of, she sent out her Fish-men to\r\ndestroy, as they had done before, the remainder of all their Naval\r\nPower, by which they were soon forced again to submit, except some\r\nNations which could live without Foreign Traffick, and some whose Trade\r\nand Traffick was meerly by Land; these would no ways be Tributary to the\r\nmentioned King. The Empress sent them word, That in case they did not\r\nsubmit to him, she intended to fire all their Towns and Cities, and\r\nreduce them by force, to what they would not yield with a good will. But\r\nthey rejected and scorned her Majesties Message, which provoked her\r\nanger so much, that she resolved to send her Bird- and Worm men thither,\r\nwith order to begin first with their smaller Towns, and set them on fire\r\n(for she was loath to make more spoil then she was forced to do) and if\r\nthey remain'd still obstinate in their resolutions, to destroy also\r\ntheir greater Cities. The onely difficulty was, how to convey the\r\nWorm-men conveniently to those places; but they desired that her Majesty\r\nwould but set them upon any part of the Earth of those Nations, and they\r\ncould travel within the Earth as easily, and as nimbly as men upon the\r\nface of the Earth; which the Empress did according to their desire.\r\n\r\nBut before both the Bird- and Worm-men began their journey, the Empress\r\ncommanded the Bear-men to view through their Telescopes what Towns and\r\nCities those were that would not submit; and having a full information\r\nthereof, she instructed the Bird- and Bear-men what Towns they should\r\nbegin withal; in the mean while she sent to all the Princes and\r\nsoveraigns of those Nations, to let them know that she would give them a\r\nproof of her Power, and check their Obstinacies by burning some of their\r\nsmaller Towns; and if they continued still in their Obstinate\r\nResolutions, that she would convert their smaller Loss into a Total\r\nRuin. She also commanded her Bird-men to make their flight at night,\r\nlest they be perceived. At last when both the Bird- and Worm-men came to\r\nthe designed places, the Worm-men laid some Fire-stones under the\r\nFoundation of every House, and the Bird-men placed some at the tops of\r\nthem, so that both by rain, and by some other moisture within the Earth,\r\nthe stones could not fail of burning. The Bird-men in the mean time\r\nhaving learned some few words of their Language, told them, That the\r\nnext time it did rain, their Towns would be all on fire; at which they\r\nwere amaz'd to hear Men speak in the air; but withall they laughed when\r\nthey heard them say that rain should fire their Towns; knowing that the\r\neffect of Water was to quench, not produce Fire.\r\n\r\nAt last a rain came, and upon a sudden all their Houses appeared of a\r\nflaming Fire; and the more Water there was poured on them, the more they\r\ndid flame and burn; which struck such a Fright and Terror into all the\r\nNeighbouring Cities, Nations and Kingdoms, that for fear the like should\r\nhappen to them, they and all the rest of the parts of that World,\r\ngranted the Empress's desire, and submitted to the Monarch and sovereign\r\nof her Native Countrey, the King of Esfi; save one, which having seldom\r\nor never any rain, but onely dews, which would soon be spent in a great\r\nfire, slighted her Power: The Empress being desirous to make it stoop as\r\nwell as the rest, knew that every year it was watered by a flowing Tide,\r\nwhich lasted some Weeks; and although their Houses stood high from the\r\nground, yet they were built upon Supporters which were fixt into the\r\nground. Wherefore she commanded both her Bird- and Worm-men to lay some\r\nof the Fire-stones at the bottom of those Supporters, and when the Tide\r\ncame in, all their Houses were of a Fire, which did so rarifie the\r\nWater, that the Tide was soon turn'd into a Vapour, and this Vapour\r\nagain into Air; which caused not onely a destruction of their Houses,\r\nbut also a general barrenness over all their Countrey that year, and\r\nforced them to submit, as well as the rest of the World had done.\r\n\r\nThus the Empress did not onely save her Native Country, but made it the\r\nAbsolute Monarchy of all that World; and both the effects of her Power\r\nand her Beauty, did kindle a great desire in all the greatest Princes to\r\nsee her; who hearing that she was resolved to return into her own\r\nBlazing-World, they all entreated the favour, that they might wait on\r\nher Majesty before she went. The Empress sent word, That she should be\r\nglad to grant their Requests; but having no other place of Reception for\r\nthem, she desired that they would be pleased to come into the open Seas\r\nwith their Ships, and make a Circle of a pretty large compass, and then\r\nher own Ships should meet them, and close up the Circle, and she would\r\npresent her self to the view of all those that came to see her: Which\r\nAnswer was joyfully received by all the mentioned Princes, who came,\r\nsome sooner, and some later, each according to the distance of his\r\nCountrey, and the length of the voyage. And being all met in the form\r\nand manner aforesaid, the Empress appeared upon the face of the Water in\r\nher Imperial Robes; in some part of her hair, near her face, she had\r\nplaced some of the Starr- Stone, which added such a luster and glory to\r\nit, that it caused a great admiration in all that were present, who\r\nbelieved her to be some Celestial Creature, or rather an uncreated\r\nGoddess, and they all had a desire to worship her; for surely, said\r\nthey, no mortal creature can have such a splendid and transcendent\r\nbeauty, nor can any have so great a power as she has, to walk upon the\r\nWaters, and to destroy whatever she pleases, not onely whole Nations,\r\nbut a whole World.\r\n\r\nThe Empress expressed to her own Countrymen, who were also her\r\nInterpreters to the rest of the Princes that were present, That she\r\nwould give them an Entertainment at the darkest time of Night: Which\r\nbeing come, the Fire-Stones were lighted, which made both Air and Seas\r\nappear of a bright shining flame, insomuch that they put all Spectators\r\ninto an extream fright, who verily believed they should all be\r\ndestroyed; which the Empress perceiving, caused all the Lights of the\r\nFire-Stones to be put out, and onely shewed her self in her Garments of\r\nLight. The Bird-men carried her upon their backs into the Air, and there\r\nshe appear'd as glorious as the Sun. Then she was set down upon the Seas\r\nagain, and presently there was heard the most melodious and sweetest\r\nConsort of Voices, as ever was heard out of the Seas, which was made by\r\nthe Fish- men; this Consort was answered by another, made by the\r\nBird-men in the Air, so that it seem'd as if Sea and Air had spoke, and\r\nanswered each other by way of Singing-Dialogues, or after the manner of\r\nthose Playes that are acted by singing-Voices.\r\n\r\nBut when it was upon break of day, the Empress ended her Entertainment,\r\nand at full day-light all the Princes perceived that she went into the\r\nShip wherein the Prince and Monarch of her Native Country was, the King\r\nof Esfi, with whom she had several Conferences; and having assured Him\r\nof the readiness of her Assistance whensoever he required it, telling\r\nHim withal, That she wanted no Intelligence, she went forth again upon\r\nthe Waters, and being in the midst of the Circle made by those Ships\r\nthat were present, she desired them to draw somewhat nearer, that they\r\nmight hear her speak; which being done, she declared her self in this\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\nGreat, Heroick, and Famous Monarchs, I come hither to assist the King of\r\nEsfi against his Enemies, He being unjustly assaulted by many several\r\nNations, which would fain take away His Hereditary Rights, and\r\nPrerogatives of the Narrow Seas; at which Unjustice, Heaven was much\r\ndispleased, and for the Injuries He received from His Enemies, rewarded\r\nHim with an Absolute Power, so that now he is become the Head-Monarch of\r\nall this World; which Power, though you may envy, yet you can no wayes\r\nhinder Him; for all those that endeavour to resist His Power, shall\r\nonely get Loss for their Labour, and no Victory for their Profit.\r\nWherefore my advice to you all is, To pay him Tribute justly and truly,\r\nthat you may live Peaceably and Happily, and be rewarded with the\r\nBlessings of Heaven: which I wish you from my Soul.\r\n\r\nAfter the Empress had thus finished her Speech to the Princes of the\r\nseveral Nations of that World, she desired that in their Ships might\r\nfall back; which being done, her own Fleet came into the Circle, without\r\nany visible assistance of Sails or Tide; and her self being entred into\r\nher own Ship, the whole Fleet sunk immediately into the bottom of the\r\nSeas, and left all the Spectators in a deep amazement; neither would she\r\nsuffer any of her Ships to come above the Waters, until she arrived into\r\nthe Blazing-World.\r\n\r\nIn time of the Voyage, both the Empress's and the Duchess's Soul, were\r\nvery gay and merry; and sometimes they would converse very seriously\r\nwith each other. Amongst the rest of their discourses, the Duchess said,\r\nshe wondred much at one thing, which was, That since her Majesty had\r\nfound out a passage out of the Blazing-World, into the World she came\r\nfrom, she did not enrich that part of the World where she was born, at\r\nleast her own Family, though she had enough to enrich the whole World.\r\nThe Empress's Soul answered, That she loved her Native Countrey, and her\r\nown Family, as well as any Creature could do; and that this was the\r\nreason why she would not enrich them: for, said she, not only particular\r\nFamilies or Nations, but all the World, their Natures are such, that\r\nmuch Gold, and great store of Riches, makes them mad; insomuch as they\r\nendeavour to destroy each other for Gold or Riches sake. The reason\r\nthereof is, said the Duchess, that they have too little Gold and Riches,\r\nwhich makes them so eager to have it. No, replied the Empress's Soul,\r\ntheir particular Covetousness, is beyond all the wealth of the richest\r\nWorld, and the more Riches they have, the more Covetous they are; for\r\ntheir Covetousness is Infinite. But, said she, I would there could a\r\nPassage be found out of the Blazing-World, into the World whence you\r\ncame, and I would willingly give you as much Riches as you desir'd. The\r\nDuchess's Soul gave her Majesty humble thanks for her great Favour; and\r\ntold her, that she was not covetous, nor desir'd any more wealth than\r\nwhat her Lord and Husband had before the Civil-Warrs. Neither, said she,\r\nshould I desire it for my own, but my Lord's Posterities sake. Well,\r\nsaid the Empress, I'le command my Fish-men to use all their Skill and\r\nIndustry to find out a Passage into that World which your Lord and\r\nHusband is in. I do verily believe, answered the Duchess, that there\r\nwill be no Passage found into that World; but if there were any, I\r\nshould not Petition your Majesty for Gold and Jewels, but only for the\r\nElixir that grows in the midst of the Golden Sands, for to preserve Life\r\nand Health; but without a Passage, it is impossible to carry away any of\r\nit: for, whatsoever is Material, cannot travel like Immaterial Beings,\r\nsuch as Souls and Spirits are. Neither do Souls require any such thing\r\nthat might revive them, or prolong their Lives, by reason they are\r\nunalterable: for, were Souls like Bodies, then my Soul might have had\r\nthe benefit of that Natural Elixir that grows in your Blazing-World. I\r\nwish earnestly, said the Empress, that a Passage might be found, and\r\nthen both your Lord and your self, should neither want Wealth, nor\r\nLong-life: nay, I love you so well, that I would make you as Great and\r\nPowerful a Monarchess, as I am of the Blazing-World. The Duchess's Soul\r\nhumbly thank'd her Majesty, and told her, That she acknowledged and\r\nesteemed her Love beyond all things that are in Nature.\r\n\r\nAfter this Discourse, they had many other Conferences, which for\r\nbrevity's sake I'le forbear to rehearse. At last, after several\r\nQuestions which the Empress's Soul asked the Duchess, she desired to\r\nknow the reason why she did take such delight, when she was joyned to\r\nher Body, in being singular both in Accoustrements, Behaviour, and\r\nDiscourse? The Duchess's Soul answered, she confessed that it was\r\nextravagant, and beyond what was usual and ordinary: but yet her\r\nambition being such, that she would not be like others in any thing, if\r\nit were possible, I endeavour, said she, to be as singular as I can:\r\nfor, it argues but a mean Nature, to imitate others: and though I do not\r\nlove to be imitated, if I can possibly avoid it; yet, rather than\r\nimitate others, I should chuse to be imitated by others: for my Nature\r\nis such, that I had rather appear worse in Singularity, than better in\r\nthe Mode. If you were not a great Lady, replied the Empress, you would\r\nnever pass in the World for a wise Lady: for, the World would say, your\r\nSingularities are Vanities. The Duchess's Soul answered, she did not at\r\nall regard the Censure of this, or any other Age, concerning Vanities:\r\nbut, said she, neither this present, nor any of the future Ages, can or\r\nwill truly say, that I am not Vertuous and Chast: for I am confident,\r\nall that were, or are acquainted with me, and all the Servants which\r\never I had, will or can upon their oaths declare my actions no otherwise\r\nthan Vertuous: and certainly, there's none even of the meanest Degree,\r\nwhich have not their Spies and Witnesses, much more those of the Nobler\r\nsort, which seldom or never are without Attendants; so that their Faults\r\n(if they have any) will easily be known, and as easily be divulged.\r\nWherefore, happy are those Natures that are Honest, Vertuous, and Noble;\r\nnot only happy to themselves, but happy to their Families. But, said the\r\nEmpress, if you glory so much in your Honesty and Vertue, how comes it\r\nthat you plead for Dishonest and Wicked persons, in your Writings? The\r\nDuchess answered, It was only to shew her Wit, not her Nature.\r\n\r\nAt last the Empress arrived into the Blazing-World, and coming to her\r\nImperial Palace, you may sooner imagine than expect that I should\r\nexpress the joy which the Emperor had at her safe return; for he loved\r\nher beyond his Soul; and there was no love lost, for the Empress equal'd\r\nhis Affection with no less love to him. After the time of rejoicing with\r\neach other, the Duchess's Soul begg'd leave to return to her Noble Lord:\r\nBut the Emperor desired, that before she departed, she would see how he\r\nhad employed his time in the Empress's absence; for he had built Stables\r\nand Riding-Houses, and desired to have Horses of Manage, such as,\r\naccording to the Empress's Relation, the Duke of Newcastlehad: The\r\nEmperor enquired of the Duchess, the Form and Structure of her Lord and\r\nHusband's Stables and Riding-House. The Duchess answer'd his Majesty,\r\nThat they were but plain and ordinary; but, said she, had my Lord\r\nWealth, I am sure he would not spare it, in rendring his Buildings as\r\nNoble as could be made. Hereupon the Emperor shewed the Duchess the\r\nStables he had built, which were most stately and magnificent; among the\r\nrest, there was one double Stable that held a Hundred Horses on a side,\r\nthe main Building was of Gold, lined with several sorts of precious\r\nMaterials; the Roof was Arched with Agats, the sides of the Walls were\r\nlined with Cornelian, the Floor was paved with Amber, the Mangers were\r\nMother of Pearl; the Pillars, as also the middle Isle or Walk of the\r\nStables, were of Crystal; the Front and Gate was of Turquois, most\r\nneatly cut and carved. The Riding-House was lined with Saphirs, Topases,\r\nand the like; the Floor was all of Golden-Sand so finely sifted, that it\r\nwas extreamly soft, and not in the least hurtful to the Horses feet, and\r\nthe Door and Frontispiece was of Emeralds curiously carved.\r\n\r\nAfter the view of these Glorious and Magnificent Buildings, which the\r\nDuchess's Soul was much delighted withall, she resolved to take her\r\nleave; but the Emperor desired her to stay yet some short time more, for\r\nthey both loved her company so well, that they were unwilling to have\r\nher depart so soon: several Conferences and Discourses pass'd between\r\nthem; amongst the rest, the Emperor desir'd her advice how to set up a\r\nTheatre for Plays. The Duchess confessed her Ignorance in this Art,\r\ntelling his Majesty that she knew nothing of erecting Theatres or\r\nScenes, but what she had by an Immaterial Observation, when she was with\r\nthe Empress's Soul in the chief City of E. Entring into one of their\r\nTheatres, whereof the Empress could give as much account to his Majesty,\r\nas her self. But both the Emperor and the Empress told the Duchess, That\r\nshe could give directions how to make Plays. The Duchess answered, That\r\nshe had as little skill to form a Play after the Mode, as she had to\r\npaint or make a Scene for shew. But you have made Plays, replied the\r\nEmpress: Yes, answered the Duchess, I intended them for Plays; but the\r\nWits of these present times condemned them as uncapable of being\r\nrepresented or acted, because they were not made up according to the\r\nRules of Art; though I dare say, That the Descriptions are as good as\r\nany they have writ. The Emperor asked, Whether the Property of Plays\r\nwere not to describe the several Humours, Actions and Fortunes of\r\nMankind? 'Tis so, answered the Duchess. Why then, replied the Emperor,\r\nthe natural Humours, Actions and Fortunes of Mankind, are not done by\r\nthe Rules of Art: But, said the Duchess, it is the Art and Method of our\r\nWits to despise all Descriptions of Wit, Humour, Actions and Fortunes\r\nthat are without such Artificial Rules. The Emperor asked, Are those\r\ngood Plays that are made so Methodically and Artificially? The Duchess\r\nanswer'd, They were Good according to the Judgment of the Age, or Mode\r\nof the Nation, but not according to her Judgment: for truly, said she,\r\nin my Opinion, their Plays will prove a Nursery of whining Lovers, and\r\nnot an Academy or School for Wise, Witty, Noble and well-behaved men.\r\nBut I, replied the Emperor, desire such a Theatre as may make wise Men;\r\nand will have such Descriptions as are Natural, not Artificial. If your\r\nMajesty be of that Opinion, said the Duchess's Soul, then my Playes may\r\nbe acted in your Blazing- World, when they cannot be acted in the\r\nBlinking-World of Wit; and the next time I come to visit your Majesty, I\r\nshall endeavour to order your Majesty's Theatre, to present such Playes\r\nas my Wit is capable to make. Then the Empress told the Duchess, That\r\nshe loved a foolish Farse added to a wise Play. The Duchess answered,\r\nThat no World in Nature had fitter Creatures for it than the\r\nBlazing-World: for, said she, the Lowse- men, the Bird-men, the Spider-\r\nand Fox-men, the Ape-men and Satyrs appear in a Farse extraordinary\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\nHereupon both the Emperor and Empress intreated the Duchess's Soul to\r\nstay so long with them, till she had ordered her Theatre, and made\r\nPlayes and Farses fit for them; for they onely wanted that sort of\r\nRecreation: but the Duchess's Soul begg'd their Majesties to give her\r\nleave to go into her Native World; for she long'd to be with her dear\r\nLord and Husband, promising, that after a short time she would return\r\nagain. Which being granted, though with much difficulty, she took her\r\nleave with all Civility and Respect, and so departed from their Majesties.\r\n\r\nAfter the Duchess's return into her own body, she entertained her Lord\r\n(when he was pleased to hear such kind of Discourses) with Foreign\r\nRelations; but he was never displeased to hear of the Empress's kind\r\nCommendations, and of the Characters she was pleased to give of him to\r\nthe Emperor. Amongst other Relations, she told him all what had past\r\nbetween the Empress, and the several Monarchs of that World whither she\r\nwent with the Empress; and how she had subdued them to pay Tribute and\r\nHomage to the Monarch of that Nation or Kingdom to which she owed both\r\nher Birth and Education. she also related to her Lord what Magnificent\r\nStables and Riding-Houses the Emperor had built, and what fine Horses\r\nwere in the Blazing-World, of several shapes and sizes, and how exact\r\ntheir shapes were in each sort, and of many various Colours, and fine\r\nMarks, as if they had been painted by Art, with such Coats or Skins,\r\nthat they had a far greater gloss and smoothness than Satin; and were\r\nthere but a passage out of the Blazing-World into this, said she, you\r\nshould not onely have some of those Horses, but such Materials as the\r\nEmperor has, to build your Stables and Riding-Houses withall; and so\r\nmuch Gold, that I should never repine at your Noble and Generous Gifts.\r\nThe Duke smilingly answered her, That he was sorry there was no Passage\r\nbetween those two Worlds; but, said he, I have always found an\r\nObstruction to my Good Fortunes.\r\n\r\nOne time the Duchess chanced to discourse with some of her acquaintance,\r\nof the Empress of the Blazing-World, who asked her what Pastimes and\r\nRecreations her Majesty did most delight in? The Duchess answered, That\r\nshe spent most of her time in the study of Natural Causes and Effects,\r\nwhich was her chief delight and pastime; and that she loved to discourse\r\nsometimes with the most Learned persons of that World: And to please the\r\nEmperor and his Nobles, who were all of the Royal Race, she went often\r\nabroad to take the air, but seldom in the day-time, always at night, if\r\nit might be called Night; for, said she, the Nights there, are as light\r\nas Days, by reason of the numerous Blazing-Stars, which are very\r\nsplendorous, onely their Light is whiter than the Sun's Light; and as\r\nthe Sun's Light is hot, so their Light is cool; not so cool as our\r\ntwinkling Starr-light, nor is their Sun-light so hot as ours, but more\r\nrate: And that part of the Blazing-World where the Empress resides, is\r\nalways clear, and never subject to any Storms, Tempests, Fogs or Mists,\r\nbut has onely refreshing-Dews that nourish the Earth: The air of it is\r\nsweet and temperate, and, as I said before, as much light in the Sun's\r\nabsence, as in its presence, which makes that time we call Night, more\r\npleasant there than the Day: And sometimes the Empress goes abroad by\r\nWater in Barges, sometimes by Land in Chariots, and sometimes on\r\nHorse-back; her Royal Chariots are very Glorious, the Body is one intire\r\ngreen Diamond; the four small Pillars that bear up the Top-cover, are\r\nfour white Diamonds, cut in the form thereof; the top or roof of the\r\nChariot, is one intire blew Diamond, and at the four corners are great\r\nsprings of Rubies; the Seat is made of Cloth of Gold, stuffed with\r\nAmbergreece beaten small: the Chariot is drawn by Twelve Unicorns, whose\r\nTrappings are all Chains of Pearl; and as for her Barges, they are onely\r\nof Gold. Her Guard of State (for she needs none for security, there\r\nbeing no Rebels or Enemies) consists of Giants, but they seldom wait on\r\ntheir Majesties abroad, because their extraordinary height and bigness\r\ndoes hinder their prospect. Her Entertainment when she is upon the\r\nWater, is the Musick of the Fish- and Bird-men; and by Land are Horse\r\nand Foot-matches; for the Empress takes much delight in making\r\nRace-matches with the Emperor, and the Nobility; some Races are between\r\nthe Fox- and Ape-men, which sometimes the Satyrs strive to outrun; and\r\nsome are between the Spider-men and Lice-men. Also there are several\r\nFlight-matches, between the several sorts of Bird-men, and the several\r\nsorts of Fly-men; and swimming-matches, between the several sorts of\r\nFish-men. The Emperor, Empress, and their Nobles, take also great\r\ndelight to have Collations; for in the Blazing-World, there are most\r\ndelicious Fruits of all sorts, and some such as in this World were never\r\nseen nor tasted; for there are most tempting sorts of Fruit: After their\r\nCollations are ended, they Dance; and if they be upon the Water, they\r\ndance upon the Water, there lying so many Fish-men so close and thick\r\ntogether, as they can dance very evenly and easily upon their backs, and\r\nneed not fear drowning. Their Musick, both Vocal and Instrumental, is\r\naccording to their several places: Upon the Water, it is of\r\nWater-Instruments, as shells filled with Water, and so moved by Art,\r\nwhich is a very sweet and delightful harmony; and those Dances which\r\nthey dance upon the Water, are, for the most part, such as we in this\r\nWorld call swimming- Dances, where they do not lift up their feet high:\r\nIn Lawns, or upon Plains, they have Wind-Instruments, but much better\r\nthan those in our World: And when they dance in the Woods, they have\r\nHorn-Instruments, which although they are of a sort of Wind-Instruments,\r\nyet they are of another Fashion than the former: In their Houses they\r\nhave such Instruments as are somewhat like our Viols, Violins,\r\nTheorboes, Lutes, Citherins, Gittars, Harpsichords, and the like; but\r\nyet so far beyond them, that the difference cannot well be exprest; and\r\nas their places of Dancing, and their Musick is different, so is their\r\nmanner or way of Dancing. In these and the like Recreations, the\r\nEmperor, Empress, and the Nobility pass their time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epilogue to the Reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this Poetical Description, you may perceive, that my ambition is not\r\nonely to be Empress, but Authoress of a whole World; and that the Worlds\r\nI have made, both the Blazing- and the other Philosophical World,\r\nmentioned in the first part of this Description, are framed and composed\r\nof the most pure, that is, the Rational parts of Matter, which are the\r\nparts of my Mind; which Creation was more easily and suddenly effected,\r\nthan the Conquests of the two famous Monarchs of the World. Alexander\r\nand Cesar. Neither have I made such disturbances, and caused so many\r\ndissolutions of particulars, otherwise named deaths, as they did; for I\r\nhave destroyed but some few men in a little Boat, which dyed through the\r\nextremity of cold, and that by the hand of Justice, which was\r\nnecessitated to punish their crime of stealing away a young and\r\nbeauteous Lady. And in the formation of those Worlds, I take more\r\ndelight and glory, then ever Alexander or Cesar did in conquering this\r\nterrestrial world; and though I have made my Blazing-World a Peaceable\r\nWorld, allowing it but one Religion, one Language, and one Government;\r\nyet could I make another World, as full of Factions, Divisions and\r\nWarrs, as this is of Peace and Tranquility; and the Rational figures of\r\nmy Mind might express as much courage to fight, as Hector and Achilles\r\nhad; and be as wise as Nestor, as Eloquent as Ulysses, and be as\r\nbeautiful as Hellen. But I esteeming Peace before Warr, Wit before\r\nPolicy, Honesty before Beauty; instead of the figures of Alexander,\r\nCesar, Hector, Achilles, Nestor, Ulysses, Hellen, &c. chose rather the\r\nfigure of Honest Margaret Newcastle, which now I would not change for\r\nall this Terrestrial World; and if any should like the World I have\r\nmade, and be willing to be my Subjects, they may imagine themselves\r\nsuch, and they are such, I mean in their Minds, Fancies or Imaginations;\r\nbut if they cannot endure to be Subjects, they may create Worlds of\r\ntheir own, and Govern themselves as they please. But yet let them have a\r\ncare, not to prove unjust Usurpers, and to rob me of mine: for,\r\nconcerning the Philosophical-world, I am Empress of it my self; and as\r\nfor the Blazing-World, it having an Empress already, who rules it with\r\ngreat Wisdom and Conduct, which Empress is my dear Platonick Friend; I\r\nshall never prove so unjust, treacherous and unworthy to her, as to\r\ndisturb her Government, much less to depose her from her Imperial\r\nThrone, for the sake of any other, but rather chuse to create another\r\nWorld for another Friend.\r\n\r\nFINIS.",
