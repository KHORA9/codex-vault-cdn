Unfortunately\r\nthe functions of the engineer and chemist are generally regarded as\r\nindependent of one another, so that the chemist is only called in by\r\nthe engineer when efforts along the lines of mechanical improvement\r\nhave failed, and _vice versa_. It is impossible, however, to draw a\r\nhard and fast line, and the best results in the art of paper-making are\r\nonly possible when the manufacturer appreciates the fact that the skill\r\nof both is essential to progress and commercial success.\r\n\r\nIn the present elementary text-book it is only proposed to give an\r\noutline of the various stages of manufacture and to indicate some of\r\nthe improvements made during recent years.\r\n\r\nThe author begs to acknowledge his indebtedness to manufacturers and\r\nothers who have given permission for the use of illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\n    PREFACE                                                          v\r\n\r\n    LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS                                           ix\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER\r\n\r\n     I.

The study of its development\r\nfrom the early bygone ages when men were compelled to find some means\r\nfor recording important events and transactions is both interesting and\r\ninstructive, so that a short summary of the known facts relating to the\r\nhistory of paper may well serve as an introduction to an account of the\r\nmanufacture and use of this indispensable article.\r\n\r\n_Tradition._--The early races of mankind contented themselves with\r\nkeeping alive the memory of great achievements by means of tradition.\r\nValiant deeds were further commemorated by the planting of trees, the\r\nsetting up of heaps of stones, and the erection of clumsy monuments.\r\n\r\n_Stone Obelisks._--The possibility of obtaining greater accuracy by\r\ncarving the rude hieroglyphics of men and animals, birds and plants,\r\nsoon suggested itself as an obvious improvement; and as early as B.C.\r\n4000 the first records which conveyed any meaning to later ages were\r\nfaithfully inscribed, and for the most part consigned to the care of\r\nthe priests.\r\n\r\n_Clay Tablets._--The ordinary transactions of daily life, the writings\r\nof literary and scientific men, and all that was worthy of note in\r\nthe history of such nations as Chaldea and Assyria have come down to\r\nus also, inscribed on clay tablets, which were rendered durable by\r\ncareful baking. On a tablet of clay, one of the earliest specimens of\r\nwriting in existence, now preserved in the British Museum, is recorded\r\na proposal of marriage, written about B.C. 1530, from one of the\r\nPharaohs, asking for the hand of the daughter of a Babylonian king.\r\n\r\n_Waxed Boards._--Bone, ivory, plates of metal, lead, gold, and brass,\r\nwere freely used, and at an early period wooden boards covered with\r\nwax were devised by the Romans. In fact, any material having a soft\r\nimpressionable surface was speedily adopted as a medium for the\r\npermanent expression of men's fancy, so that it is not strange to find\r\ninstances of documents written on such curious substances as animal\r\nskins, hides, dried intestines, and leather. The works of Homer,\r\npreserved in one of the Egyptian libraries in the days of Ptolemæus\r\nPhiladelphus, were said to have been written in letters of gold on the\r\nskins of serpents.\r\n\r\n_Leaves, Bark._--The first actual advance in the direction of paper,\r\nas commonly understood, was made when the leaves and bark of trees\r\nwere utilised. The latter especially came speedily into favour, and\r\nthe extensive use of the inner bark (_liber_) made rapid headway.\r\nManuscripts and documents written on this liber are to be found in many\r\nmuseums.\r\n\r\n_Papyrus._--The discovery of the wonderful properties of the Egyptian\r\npapyrus was a great step in developing the art of paper-making. The\r\ndate of this discovery is very uncertain, but one of the earliest\r\nreferences is to be found in the works of Pliny, where mention is made\r\nof the writings of Numa, who lived about B.C. 670. This celebrated\r\nplant had long been noted for its value in the manufacture of mats,\r\ncordage, and wearing apparel, but its fame rests upon its utility in\r\nquite a different direction, namely, for conveying to posterity the\r\nwritten records of those early days which have proved a source of\r\nunending interest to antiquaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Sheet of Papyrus, showing the layers crossing\r\none another (Evans).]\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian papyrus was made from the fine layers of fibrous matter\r\nsurrounding the parent stem. These layers were removed by means of a\r\nsharp tool, spread out on a board, moistened with some gummy water, and\r\nthen covered with similar layers placed over them crosswise. The sheets\r\nso produced were pressed, dried, and polished with a piece of ivory or\r\na smooth stone. Long rolls of papyrus were formed by pasting several\r\nsheets together to give what was termed a _volumen_.\r\n\r\n_Roman Papyri._--The Romans improved the process of manufacture,\r\nand were able to produce a variety of papers, to which they gave\r\ndifferent names, such as _Charta hieratica_ (holy paper, used by\r\npriests), _Charta Fanniana_ (a superior paper made by Fannius), _Charta\r\nemporetica_ (shop or wrapping paper), _Charta Saitica_ (after the city\r\nof Sais), etc. The papyrus must have been used in great quantities\r\nfor this purpose, since recent explorations in Eastern countries have\r\nbrought to light enormous finds of papyri in a wonderful state of\r\npreservation. In 1753, when the ruins of Herculaneum were unearthed, no\r\nless than 1,800 rolls were discovered. During the last ten years huge\r\nquantities have been brought to England.\r\n\r\n_Parchment._--Parchment succeeded papyrus as an excellent writing\r\nmaterial, being devised as a substitute for the latter by the\r\ninhabitants of Pergamus on account of the prohibited exportation of\r\nEgyptian papyrus. For many centuries parchment held a foremost place\r\namongst the available materials serving the purpose of paper, and even\r\nto-day it is used for important legal documents. This parchment was\r\nmade from the skins of sheep and goats, which were first steeped in\r\nlime pits, and then scraped. By the plentiful use of chalk and pumice\r\nstone the colour and surface of the parchment were greatly enhanced.\r\nVellum, prepared in a similar manner from the skins of calves, was\r\nalso extensively employed as a writing material, and was probably the\r\nfirst material used for binding books. Until comparatively recent times\r\nthe term \"parchment\" comprehended vellum, but the latter substance is\r\nmuch superior to that manufactured from sheep and goat skins.\r\n\r\n_Paper._--The Chinese are now generally credited with the art of making\r\npaper of the kind most familiar to us, that is from fibrous material\r\nfirst reduced to the condition of pulp. Materials such as strips of\r\nbark, leaves, and papyrus cannot of course be included in a definition\r\nlike this, which one writer has condensed into the phrase \"Paper is an\r\naqueous deposit of vegetable fibre.\"\r\n\r\nA.D. 105.--The earliest reference to the manufacture of paper is to be\r\nfound in the Chinese Encyclopædia, wherein it is stated that Ts'ai-Lun,\r\na native of Kuei-yang, entered the service of the Emperor Ho-Ti in A.D.\r\n75, and devoting his leisure hours to study, suggested the use of silk\r\nand ink as a substitute for the bamboo tablet and stylus. Subsequently\r\nhe succeeded in making paper from bark, tow, old linen, and fish nets\r\n(A.D. 105). He was created marquis in A.D. 114 for his long years of\r\nservice and his ability.\r\n\r\nA.D. 704.--It has been commonly asserted that raw cotton, or cotton\r\nwool, was first used by the Arabs at this date for the manufacture\r\nof paper, they having learnt the art from certain Chinese prisoners\r\ncaptured at the occupation of Samarkand by the Arabs. The complete\r\nconquest of Samarkand does not, however, seem to have taken place until\r\nA.D. 751, and there is little doubt that this date should be accepted\r\nfor the introduction of the art of paper-making among the Arabs.\r\n\r\n_Recent Researches._--Professors Wiesner and Karabacek have ascertained\r\none or two most important and interesting facts concerning the actual\r\nmanufacture of _pure_ rag paper. In 1877 a great quantity of ancient\r\nmanuscripts was found at El-Faijum, in Egypt, comprising about 100,000\r\ndocuments in ten languages, extending from B.C. 1400 to A.D.\r\n1300, many of which were written on paper. The documents were closely\r\nexamined in 1894 by these experts, at the request of the owner, the\r\nArchduke Rainer of Austria.\r\n\r\nResearches of a later date resulted in the discovery of some further\r\ninteresting documents which appear to establish with some degree of\r\ncertainty the approximate date at which _pure_ rag paper, that is,\r\npaper made entirely from rag, was manufactured.\r\n\r\nChinese documents dated A.D. 768-786, which have been reported upon\r\nby Dr. Hoernle, and others dated A.D. 781-782-787, reported upon by\r\nDr. Stein as recently as 1901, appear to show what materials were used\r\nby the Chinese paper-makers in Western Turkestan. The manuscripts\r\nmentioned were dug out from the sand-buried site of Dandan Uilig, in\r\nEastern Turkestan.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wiesner found that all the papers of the Rainer collection\r\nwere made of _linen_ rag, with an occasional trace of _cotton_,\r\nprobably added accidentally. The earliest dated paper was a letter A.D.\r\n874, but two documents, which from other reasons could be identified as\r\nbelonging to A.D. 792, proved that at the end of the eighth century the\r\nArabs understood the art of making linen paper on network moulds, and\r\nfurther that they added starch for the purpose of sizing and loading\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\nProfessor Karabacek advances some ingenious explanations as to the\r\norigin of the idea that raw cotton was first used for paper-making,\r\nand he suggests that the legend owes its origin to a misunderstanding\r\nof terms. In mediæval times paper was known as _Charta bombycina_, and\r\nsometimes as _Charta Damascena_, the latter from its place of origin.\r\n\r\nPaper was also made in Bambyce, and a natural confusion arose between\r\nthe terms, since the word _bombyx_ was used as a name for cotton, and\r\nthe paper commonly in use suggested that material to the mind of the\r\nobserver, and the name became corrupted to _bombycina_.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions of Professor Karabacek, together with the microscopical\r\ninvestigations of Dr. Wiesner, appear to show that paper made entirely\r\nfrom raw cotton fibre was not known.\r\n\r\n_Invention of Rag Paper._--Dr. Hoernle, in discussing this question,\r\npoints out that, taking A.D. 751 as the date when the Arabs learnt\r\nthe art of paper-making, and A.D. 792 as the date when paper made\r\nentirely of linen rag was produced, the date of the invention of rag\r\npaper must lie between these two dates. The documents discovered in\r\nEastern Turkestan and bearing the dates mentioned, which papers fill\r\nup the gap between the years A.D. 751 and A.D. 792, were found to\r\ncontain certain raw fibres, such as China grass, mulberry, laurel, as\r\nthe main constituents, and macerated flax and hemp rags as the minor\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nThe addition and substitution of rag evidently increased in course of\r\ntime, and since the improvement thus effected soon became an obvious\r\nand established fact, the raw fibres were omitted. Hence the credit\r\nof the manufacture of pure rag paper would be given to the people of\r\nSamarkand, the date being between the years A.D. 760 and A.D. 792; and\r\nfurther the constitution of such paper has been shown by Dr. Wiesner to\r\nbe linen, and not cotton, as commonly stated.\r\n\r\nThese researches are of such interest that we quote Professor Hoernle's\r\ntranslation of the summary of the principal results of Dr. Wiesner's\r\nexamination of the Eastern Turkestani papers so recently discovered:--\r\n\r\n\"Taking into account the dates assigned to the papers on palæographic\r\ngrounds, the following conclusions may be drawn from the examination of\r\ntheir material:--\r\n\r\n\"(1) The oldest of the Eastern Turkestani papers, dating from the\r\nfourth and fifth centuries A.D., are made of a mixture of raw fibres\r\nof the bast of various dicotyledonous plants. From these fibres the\r\nhalf-stuff for the paper was made by means of a rude mechanical process.\r\n\r\n\"(2) Similar papers, made of a mixture of raw fibres, are also found\r\nbelonging to the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries. But in this\r\nperiod there also occur papers which are made of a mixture of rudely\r\npounded rags and of raw fibres extracted by maceration.\r\n\r\n\"(3) In the same period papers make their appearance in which special\r\nmethods are used to render them capable of being written on, viz.,\r\ncoating with gypsum and sizing with starch or with a gelatine extracted\r\nfrom lichen.\r\n\r\n\"(4) In the seventh and eighth centuries both kinds of papers are of\r\nequal frequency, those made of the raw fibre of various dicotyledonous\r\nplants and those made of a mixture of rags and raw fibres. In this\r\nperiod the method of extracting the raw fibre is found to improve from\r\na rude stamping to maceration; but that of preparing the rags remains a\r\nrude stamping, and in the half-stuff thus produced from rags it is easy\r\nto distinguish the raw fibre from the crushed and broken fibre of the\r\nrags.\r\n\r\n\"(5) The old Eastern Turkestani (Chinese) paper can be distinguished\r\nfrom the old Arab paper, not only by the raw fibres which accompany the\r\nrag fibres, but also by the far-reaching destruction of the latter.\r\n\r\n\"(6) The previous researches of Professor Karabacek and the author had\r\nshown that the invention of rag paper was not made in Europe by Germans\r\nor Italians about the turn of the fourteenth century, but that the\r\nArabs knew its preparation as early as the end of the eighth century.\r\n\r\n\"The present researches now further show that the beginnings of the\r\npreparation of rag paper can be traced to the Chinese in the fifth or\r\nfourth centuries, or even earlier.\r\n\r\n\"The Chinese method of preparing rag paper never progressed beyond its\r\ninitial low stage. It was the Arabs who, having been initiated into the\r\nart by the Chinese, improved the method of preparing it, and carried it\r\nto that stage of perfection in which it was received from them by the\r\ncivilised peoples of Europe in the mediæval ages.\r\n\r\n\"(7) The author has shown that the process of sizing the paper with\r\nstarch in order to improve it was already known to the Arabs in the\r\neighth century. In the fourteenth century the knowledge of it was lost,\r\nanimal glue being substituted in the place of starch, till finally in\r\nthe nineteenth century, along with the introduction of paper machines,\r\nthe old process was resuscitated. But the invention of it was due to\r\nthe Chinese. The oldest Eastern Turkestani paper which is sized with\r\nstarch belongs to the eighth century.\r\n\r\n\"(8) The Chinese were not only the inventors of felted paper and the\r\nimitators of rag paper--though in the preparation of the latter they\r\nmade use of rags only as a surrogate by the side of raw fibres--but\r\nthey must also be credited with being the forerunners of the modern\r\nmethod of preparing 'cellulose paper.' For their very ancient practice\r\nof extracting the fibre from the bark and other parts of plants by\r\nmeans of maceration is in principle identical with the modern method of\r\nextracting 'cellulose' by means of certain chemical processes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--An Early Paper Mill (from \"Kulturhistorisches\r\nBilderbuch,\" A.D. 1564).]\r\n\r\n_Paper-making in Europe._--The introduction of the art into Europe\r\nseems to have taken place early in the eleventh century, when the Moors\r\nmanufactured paper at Toledo. The early authorities who have studied\r\nthis subject express the opinion that the paper produced in Europe at\r\nthis time was made from cotton rags and from raw cotton, but, in view\r\nof the recent researches into the composition of paper, it is difficult\r\nto say how this idea arose, unless we accept the explanation offered by\r\nProfessor Karabacek. In standard encyclopædias the following statements\r\nare made as to existing early documents printed on paper made in\r\nEurope:--\r\n\r\n  A.D. 1075. Syriac manuscripts of early date in the British\r\n               Museum.\r\n\r\n  A.D. 1102. A document printed on cotton, being a deed of King\r\n               Roger of Sicily, now at Vienna.\r\n\r\n  A.D. 1178. A treaty of peace between the Kings of Aragon and\r\n               Spain, said to be printed on linen paper, preserved at\r\n               Barcelona.\r\n\r\n  A.D. 1223. The \"Liber Plegierum,\" printed on rough cotton\r\n               paper.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting books on this subject is the \"Historical\r\nAccount of the Substances used to describe Events from the Earliest\r\nDate,\" by Matthias Koops, published in 1800. This writer appears to\r\nhave obtained most of his information from German authorities.\r\n\r\nThe industry of paper-making passed through Spain into Italy, France,\r\nand the Netherlands. In 1189 paper was being manufactured at Hainault,\r\nin France, and the industry rapidly spread all over the Continent.\r\nIn 1390 Ulman Stromer established a mill at Nuremberg, in Germany,\r\nemploying a great number of men, who were obliged to take an oath that\r\nthey would not teach anyone the art of paper-making or make paper on\r\ntheir own account. In the sixteenth century the Dutch endeavoured\r\nto protect their industry by making the exportation of moulds for\r\npaper-making an offence punishable by death.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the paper used in England was imported from France and\r\nHolland, and it was many years before the industry was established\r\nin England. This is not surprising in view of the protective and\r\nconservative policy of the Continental paper-makers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--The Paper Mill of Ulman Stromer, A.D. 1390\r\n(supposed to be the oldest known drawing of a Paper Mill).]\r\n\r\n_Paper-making in England._--The actual period at which the manufacture\r\nof paper was first started in England is somewhat uncertain. The\r\nfirst mention of any paper-maker is found in Wynkyn de Worde's \"De\r\nProprietatibus Rerum,\" printed by Caxton in 1495, the reference being\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n        And John Tate the younger, joye mote he brok,\r\n        Which late hathe in England, doo\r\n        Make thys paper thynne,\r\n        That now in our Englyssh\r\n        Thys booke is prynted inne.\r\n\r\nJohn Tate was the owner of a mill at Stevenage, Hertfordshire. In the\r\nhousehold book of Henry VII. an entry for the year 1499 reads, \"Geven\r\nin rewarde to Tate of the mylne, 6_s._ 8_d._\"\r\n\r\nIn 1588 a paper mill was erected by Sir John Spielman, a German, who\r\nobtained a licence from Queen Elizabeth \"for the sole gathering for ten\r\nyears of all rags, etc., necessary for the making of paper.\" This paper\r\nmill was eulogised by Thomas Churchyard in a long poem of forty-four\r\nstanzas, of which we quote two:--\r\n\r\n      I prayse the man that first did paper make,\r\n        The only thing that sets all virtues forth;\r\n      It shoes new bookes, and keeps old workes awake,\r\n        Much more of price than all the world is worth:\r\n      It witnesse bears of friendship, time, and troth,\r\n      And is the tromp of vice and virtue both;\r\n      Without whose help no hap nor wealth is won,\r\n      And by whose ayde great works and deedes are done.\r\n\r\n      Six hundred men are set to worke by him\r\n        That else might starve, or seeke abroad their bread,\r\n      Who now live well, and goe full brave and trim,\r\n        And who may boast they are with paper fed.\r\n      Strange is that foode, yet stranger made the same,\r\n      For greater help, I gesse, he cannot give\r\n      Than by his help to make poore folk to live.\r\n\r\nThe industry made but little progress for some time after Spielman's\r\ndeath, and up till 1670 the supplies of paper were obtained almost\r\nentirely from France. The first British patent for paper-making was\r\ngranted to Charles Hildeyard in 1665 for \"the way and art of making\r\nblue paper used by sugar bakers and others.\" The trade received a great\r\nimpetus on account of the presence of Huguenots who had fled to England\r\nfrom France in consequence of the revocation of the edict of Nantes in\r\n1685.\r\n\r\nIn 1695 a company was formed in Scotland for the \"manufacture of white\r\nand printing paper.\"\r\n\r\nImprovements in the art were slow until 1760, when Whatman, whose name\r\nhas since become famous in connection with paper, commenced operations\r\nat Maidstone. Meantime the methods by which the rags were converted\r\ninto paper were exceedingly slow and clumsy, so that the output of\r\nfinished paper was very small.\r\n\r\nSome interesting details as to the early manufacture of paper in\r\nEngland are given by Mr. Rhys Jenkins, and from his account of \"Early\r\nAttempts at Paper-making in England, 1495-1788,\" the following extracts\r\nhave been made:--\r\n\r\n  About\r\n\r\n  1496.

Trade with France prohibited by royal proclamation.\r\n\r\n  1696. Price of paper very high owing to scarcity, being 11_s._ per\r\n         ream.\r\n\r\n  1712. Duties levied on all kinds of paper, manufactured or imported.\r\n\r\n  1725. Monopoly of making paper for Bank of England notes granted to\r\n         De Portal, of the Laverstoke mills, Hampshire. This paper is\r\n         still made by the firm of Messrs. Portal.\r\n\r\n  1739. Galliott and Parry estimated that there were 600 paper mills\r\n         in England, making 6,000 reams a day. The Commissioner of\r\n         Excise reported only 278.\r\n\r\n  1739. James Whatman erected a mill at Boxley, Maidstone.\r\n\r\n  1758. Baskerville printed an edition of Virgil on so-called \"woven\"\r\n         paper.\r\n\r\n_Early Methods._--The most rapid development of the industry appears\r\nto have taken place in Holland. The rags used for paper-making were\r\nmoistened with water and stored up in heaps until they fermented\r\nand became hot. By this means the dirt and non-fibrous matter was\r\nrendered partially soluble, so that on washing a suitable paper pulp\r\nwas obtained. The washed rags were then placed in a stamping machine\r\nresembling an ordinary pestle and mortar. The mortars were constructed\r\nof stone and wood, and the stamps were kept in motion by levers which\r\nwere raised by projections fixed on the shaft of a waterwheel. The\r\noperation of beating thus occupied a long period, but the paper\r\nproduced was of great strength.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the \"Hollander,\" a simple yet ingenious engine which\r\nis deservedly known by the name of the country in which it first\r\noriginated, gave a tremendous impetus to the art of paper-making,\r\nas by its means the quantity of material which could be treated in\r\ntwenty-four hours was greatly increased. Unfortunately the date of the\r\ninvention of this important machine has not been definitely traced. The\r\nearliest mention of it seems to occur in Sturm's \"Vollständige Mühlen\r\nBaukunst,\" published in 1718. It was in extensive use at Saardam in\r\n1697, so that the invention is at least some years previous to 1690.\r\n\r\nOn this point Koops says: \"In Gelderland are a great many mills, but\r\nsome so small that they are only able to make 400 reams of paper\r\nannually, and there are also water mills with stampers, like those\r\nin Germany. But in the province of Holland there are windmills,\r\nwith cutting and grinding engines, which do more in two hours than\r\nthe others do in twelve. In Saardam 1,000 persons are employed in\r\npaper-making.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST FOURDRINIER PAPER MACHINE.\r\n\r\nUp till the year 1799 paper was made entirely in sheets on a hand\r\nmould, but during the last few years of the eighteenth century a\r\nFrenchman, Nicholas Louis Robert, manager for M. Didot, who owned a\r\npaper mill at Essones, had been experimenting for the purpose of making\r\npaper in the form of a continuous sheet, and eventually produced some\r\nof considerable length.\r\n\r\nThe idea was taken to England by Didot's brother-in-law, Gamble, and\r\nintroduced to the notice of Messrs. Fourdrinier, wholesale stationers,\r\nof London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--The First Paper Machine, A.D. 1802. Plan and\r\nElevation.]\r\n\r\nThe first machine was naturally a very crude affair. It consisted of an\r\nendless wire cloth stretched in a horizontal position on two rollers,\r\none of which rotated freely in a bearing attached to the frame of the\r\nmachine, the other being fitted in an adjustable bearing so that the\r\nwire could be tightened up when necessary.\r\n\r\nThe beaten pulp, contained in a vat placed below the wire, was thrown\r\nup in a continual stream upon the surface of the wire, and carried\r\nforward towards the squeezing rolls. A shaking motion was imparted to\r\nthe travelling wire so as to cause the fibres to felt properly. A great\r\ndeal of the water fell through the meshes of the gauze, and further\r\nquantities were removed by means of the press rolls. The wet paper was\r\nthen wound up on to a wooden roller, which was taken out as soon as\r\nsufficient paper had been made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--The Improved Paper Machine of A.D. 1810.]\r\n\r\nThe whole process was carried on under great difficulties, but\r\nsubstantial improvements were soon made by the enterprising\r\nFourdriniers, who commenced operations in Bermondsey, employing Mr.\r\nBryan Donkin, then in the service of Messrs. Hall & Co., of Dartford,\r\nwho had shown himself keenly interested in the machine. In 1803 the\r\nfirst \"Fourdrinier,\" so called, was built at Bermondsey, and erected at\r\nTwo Waters Mill in Herefordshire.\r\n\r\nIn this machine the mixture of pulp and water was carried forward\r\nbetween two wires, and, after passing through the couch rolls,\r\ntransferred to an endless felt. This arrangement proved to be faulty\r\nbecause the water did not escape freely enough from the wire, and a\r\ngreat deal of the paper was spoilt.\r\n\r\nDonkin, however, hit upon a simple but effective device for curing this\r\nfault by altering the relative position of the two couch rolls. Instead\r\nof keeping the two rolls exactly in a vertical position one over the\r\nother, he placed them at a slight angle so that the upper one should\r\nbear gently on the web of paper carried by the wire before receiving\r\nthe full pressure of the rolls, and thus remove a greater proportion of\r\nthe water. In this way the paper was firmer and less liable to break\r\nwhen pressed between the couch rolls, an additional advantage being\r\nsecured in the fact that the upper wire could be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nThe various improvements effected resulted in a machine the details of\r\nwhich appear in the appended diagram, the device of the inclined couch\r\nrolls being fitted about 1810.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of water and pulp flowed from a stuff chest into a small\r\nregulating box and on to the wire over a sloping board. The pulp at\r\nonce formed into a wet sheet of paper, the water falling through the\r\nmeshes of the wire, being caught in a bucket-shaped appliance, and\r\nconveyed back to the regulating box. The stream of pulp was confined\r\nupon the wire by means of a deckle. Further quantities of water were\r\nremoved by the aid of a pair of squeezing rolls before the web passed\r\nthrough the couch rolls after which the paper was reeled up on a wooden\r\nspindle.\r\n\r\nFrom this date the success of the machine was assured, though the\r\ninventor and his colleagues were practically ruined, an experience only\r\ntoo common with the early pioneers of many great and useful industrial\r\nenterprises. In fact, the firm of Messrs. Donkin were the only people\r\nto profit from the invention, for they manufactured a number of\r\nmachines, as stated in the report of the Jurors of the Exhibition of\r\n1851, and from 1803 to 1851 no less than 190 Fourdriniers were set to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCELLULOSE AND PAPER-MAKING FIBRES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen plants such as flax, cotton, straw, hemp, and other varieties of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom are digested with a solution of caustic soda,\r\nwashed, and then bleached by means of chloride of lime, a fibrous mass\r\nis obtained more or less white in colour.\r\n\r\nThis is the substance known to paper-makers as paper pulp, and the\r\nseveral modifications of it derived from different plants are generally\r\nknown to chemists as cellulose.\r\n\r\nAlthough plants differ greatly in physical structure and general\r\nappearance, yet they all contain tissue which under suitable treatment\r\nyields a definite proportion of this fibrous substance. The preparation\r\nof a small quantity of cellulose from materials like straw, rope,\r\nhemp, the stringy bark of garden shrubs, wood, and bamboo can easily\r\nbe accomplished without special appliances. Soft materials, such as\r\nstraw and hemp, are cut up into short pieces, hard substances like\r\nwood and bamboo are thoroughly hammered out, in order to secure a fine\r\nsubdivision of the mass. The fibre so prepared is then placed in a\r\nsmall iron saucepan, and covered with a solution made up of ten parts\r\nof caustic soda and 100 parts of water. The material is boiled gently\r\nfor eight or ten hours, the water which is lost through evaporation\r\nof steam being replaced by fresh quantities of hot water at regular\r\nintervals. When the fibrous mass breaks up readily between the fingers,\r\nit is poured into a sieve, or on a piece of muslin stretched over\r\na basin, and washed completely with hot water until clean and free\r\nfrom alkali. Hard pieces and portions which seem incompletely boiled\r\nare removed, and the residual fibres separated out. These fibres are\r\nplaced in a weak, clear solution of ordinary bleaching powder, left for\r\nseveral hours, and subsequently thoroughly washed. This simple process\r\nwill give a more or less white fibrous material.\r\n\r\nThe purest form of cellulose is cotton. A very slight alkaline\r\ntreatment, followed by bleaching, is sufficient to remove the\r\nnon-fibrous constituents of the plant, and a large yield of cellulose\r\nis obtained. For this reason the cotton fibre ranks high as an almost\r\nideal material for paper-making, possessing the quality of durability.\r\n\r\nCellulose is an organic compound, containing carbon, hydrogen, and\r\noxygen in the following proportions:--\r\n\r\n          Carbon           44·2\r\n          Hydrogen          6·3\r\n          Oxygen           49·5\r\n                          -----\r\n                          100·0\r\n\r\nIts composition is represented by the formula C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}.\r\n\r\nThe celluloses obtained from various plants are not identical either in\r\nphysical structure and chemical constitution, or as to their behaviour\r\nwhen employed for paper-making. In fact, the well-known differences\r\nbetween the raw materials used for paper-making, and also between the\r\nnumerous varieties of finished paper, are to be largely accounted for\r\nand explained by a careful study of the cellulose group, particularly\r\nwith reference to the microscopic characteristics and the chemical\r\ncomposition of the individual species.\r\n\r\nThe only vegetable substance which may be regarded as a simple\r\ncellulose is cotton, all others being compound celluloses of varying\r\nconstitution, the nature of which cannot be appreciated without a\r\nconsiderable knowledge of chemistry. The classification of such plants,\r\ntherefore, in a book of this description must be limited to certain\r\ndistinctions having some immediate practical bearing on the question of\r\npaper manufacture.\r\n\r\n_Cotton._--Regarded as the typical simple cellulose, containing 91 per\r\ncent. of cellulose, and remarkable for its resistance to the action of\r\ncaustic soda.\r\n\r\n_Linen._--The cellulose isolated from flax by treatment with alkali or\r\ncaustic soda cannot readily be distinguished from cotton cellulose by\r\nchemical analysis or reactions. The difference is almost entirely a\r\nphysical one.\r\n\r\nFlax is a typical compound cellulose, to which has been given the name\r\npecto-cellulose on account of certain properties. Other well-known\r\nplants of this class are ramie, aloe, \"sunn hemp,\" manila.\r\n\r\n_Esparto._--The cellulose isolated from esparto differs in composition\r\nfrom cotton cellulose:--\r\n\r\n          Carbon                       41·0\r\n          Hydrogen                      5·8\r\n          Oxygen                       53·2\r\n                                      -----\r\n                                      100·0\r\n                                      -----\r\n\r\nIt is regarded as an oxycellulose, being readily oxidised by exposure\r\nto air at 100° C. Other oxycelluloses familiar to the paper-maker are\r\nstraw, sugarcane, bamboo.\r\n\r\n_Wood._--The difference between wood and the plants already mentioned\r\nis expressed by the term lignified fibre or ligno-cellulose. This term\r\nis used to indicate that the wood is a compound cellulose containing\r\nnon-fibrous constituents, to which has been given the name lignone.\r\nJute is another example of this class.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese distinctions may be exemplified by reference to a simple\r\nexperiment. If three papers, such as a pure rag tissue or a linen\r\nwriting, an ordinary esparto printing, and a cheap newspaper containing\r\nabout 80 per cent. of mechanical wood, are heated for twenty-four\r\nhours in an oven at a temperature of 105° C., the first will undergo\r\nlittle, if any, change in colour, while the others will be appreciably\r\ndiscoloured, the mechanical wood pulp paper most of all.\r\n\r\nThis change is due to the gradual oxidation of the constituents of\r\nthe paper, the ligno-cellulose of the mechanical wood pulp being most\r\nreadily affected by the high temperature, and the pure cellulose of the\r\nrag paper being least altered.\r\n\r\nThe process of oxidation, brought about rapidly under the conditions of\r\nthe experiment described, takes place in papers of low quality exposed\r\nto air in the ordinary circumstances of daily use, but of course at an\r\nextremely slow rate. The deterioration of such paper is not, however,\r\ndue to the simple oxidation of the cellulose compounds, because other\r\nfactors have to be taken into account. The presence of impurities in\r\nthe paper on the one hand, and of chemical vapours in the air on the\r\nother, hastens the decay of papers very considerably.\r\n\r\n_Percentage of Cellulose in Fibrous Plants._--The value of a vegetable\r\nplant for paper-making is first determined by a close examination\r\nof the physical structure of the cellulose isolated by the ordinary\r\nmethods of treatment. If the fibres are weak and short, the raw\r\nmaterial is of little value, and it is at once condemned without\r\nfurther investigation, but should the fibre prove suitable, then the\r\nquestion of the percentage of cellulose becomes important.\r\n\r\nThere are several methods employed for estimating the amount of\r\ncellulose in plants. The process giving a maximum yield is known as the\r\nchlorination method, the details of which are as follows:--About ten\r\ngrammes of the air-dried fibre is dried at 100° C. in a water oven for\r\nthe determination of moisture. A second ten grammes of the air-dried\r\nfibre is boiled for thirty minutes with a weak solution of pure caustic\r\nsoda (ten grammes of caustic soda in 1,000 cubic centimetres of water),\r\nsmall quantities of distilled water being added at frequent intervals\r\nto replace water lost by evaporation. The residue is then poured on to\r\na piece of small wire gauze, washed thoroughly, and squeezed out. The\r\nmoist mass of fibre is loosened and teased out, placed in a beaker,\r\nand submitted to the action of chlorine gas for an hour. The bright\r\nyellow mass is then washed with water and immersed in a solution of\r\nsodium sulphite (twenty grammes of sodium sulphite in 1,000 cc. of\r\nwater). The mixture is slowly heated, and finally boiled for eight to\r\nten minutes, with the addition of 10 cc. of caustic soda solution. The\r\nresidue is washed, immersed in dilute sodium hypochlorite solution\r\nfor ten minutes, again washed, first with water containing a little\r\nsulphurous acid and then with pure distilled water. It is finally dried\r\nand weighed.\r\n\r\nThe second process for estimating cellulose is based upon the use\r\nof bromine and ammonia. About ten grammes of the air-dried fibre is\r\nplaced in a well-stoppered wide-mouthed bottle with sufficient bromine\r\nwater to cover it. As the reaction proceeds the red solution gradually\r\ndecolourises, and further small additions of bromine are necessary. The\r\nmass is then washed, and boiled in a flask connected to a condenser\r\nwith a strong solution of ammonia for about three to four hours. The\r\nfibrous residue is washed, again treated with bromine water in the\r\ncold, and subsequently boiled with ammonia. The alternative treatment\r\nwith bromine and ammonia is repeated until a white fibrous mass is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIn practice the paper-maker is confined to two or three methods for the\r\nisolation of the fibres, viz., alkaline processes, which require the\r\ndigestion of the material with caustic soda, lime, lime and carbonate\r\nof soda, chiefly applied to the boiling of rags, esparto, and similar\r\npecto-celluloses; acid processes, in which the material is digested\r\nwith sulphurous acid and sulphites. The latter methods are at present\r\nalmost exclusively used for the preparation of chemical wood pulp.\r\n\r\n_Yields of Cellulose in the Paper Mill._--The object of the paper-maker\r\nis to obtain a maximum yield of cellulose residue at a minimum of cost.\r\nUsually the amount of actual bleached paper pulp obtained in the mill\r\nis less than the percentage obtained by careful quantitative analysis,\r\nfor reasons easily understood.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the raw material is digested for a stated period\r\nwith a carefully measured quantity of caustic soda, for example, at\r\na certain temperature. Now the conditions of boiling may be varied\r\nby altering one or more of these factors, the period of boiling, the\r\nstrength of solution, or the steam pressure, and the paper-maker must\r\nexercise his judgment in fixing the exact relation between the varying\r\nfactors so as to produce the best results.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the mechanical devices for washing the boiled\r\npulp and for bleaching cause slight losses of fibre, which cannot be\r\naltogether avoided when operations are conducted on a large scale.\r\nFrequently, also, a greater yield of boiled material may involve\r\na larger quantity of bleaching powder, so that it is evident the\r\nadjustment of practical conditions requires considerable technical\r\nskill and experience.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of cellulose in the vegetable plants employed more or\r\nless in the manufacture of paper is given in the following table:--\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING PERCENTAGE OF CELLULOSE IN FIBROUS PLANTS.\r\n\r\n          ------------------+-------------------------\r\n             Fibre.         |   Cellulose, per cent.\r\n          ------------------+-------------------------\r\n          Cotton            |         91·0\r\n          Flax              |         82·0\r\n          Hemp              |         77·0\r\n          Ramie             |         76·0\r\n          Manila            |         64·0\r\n          Jute              |         64·0\r\n          Wood (pine)       |         57·0\r\n          Bagasse           |         50·0\r\n          Bamboo            |         48·0\r\n          Esparto           |         48 to 42\r\n          Straw             |         48 to 40\r\n          ------------------+-------------------------\r\n\r\n_The Properties of Cellulose._--Cellulose is remarkably inert towards\r\nall ordinary solvents such as water, alcohol, turpentine, benzene,\r\nand similar reagents, a property which renders it extremely useful in\r\nmany industries, with the result that the industrial applications of\r\ncellulose are numerous and exceedingly varied.\r\n\r\n_Solubility._--Cellulose is dissolved when brought into contact with\r\ncertain metallic salts, but it behaves quite differently to ordinary\r\norganic compounds. Sugar, for example, is a crystalline body soluble\r\nin water, and can be recovered in a crystalline state by gradual\r\nevaporation of the water. Cellulose under suitable conditions can be\r\ndissolved, but it cannot be reproduced in structural form identical\r\nwith the original substance.\r\n\r\nIf cellulose is gently heated in a strong aqueous solution of zinc\r\nchloride, it gradually dissolves, a thick syrupy mass being obtained,\r\nwhich consists of a gelatinous solution of cellulose. If the mixture\r\nis diluted with cold water, a precipitate is produced consisting of\r\ncellulose hydrate intimately associated with oxide of zinc, which\r\nlatter can be dissolved out by means of hydrochloric acid. The\r\nresulting product is not, however, the original substance, but a\r\nhydrated cellulose, devoid of any crystalline structure.\r\n\r\nCellulose is also soluble in ammoniacal solutions of cupric oxide, from\r\nwhich it can be precipitated by acids or by substances which act as\r\ndehydrating agents, _e.g._, alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Hydrolysis._--An explanation of the behaviour of cellulose towards the\r\nsolvents already mentioned, and towards acid and alkali, requires a\r\nreference to its chemical composition.\r\n\r\nThe substance is a compound of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen represented\r\nby the formula\r\n\r\n                                C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}\r\n\r\nbeing one of a class of organic compounds known as carbohydrates,\r\nso designated because the hydrogen and oxygen are present in the\r\nproportions which exist in water.\r\n\r\n                      Water = Hydrogen + Oxygen\r\n                                H_{2}  +  O.\r\n\r\nThe H_{10}O_{5} in the cellulose formula corresponds to 5 (H_{2}O).\r\n\r\nWhen cellulose is acted upon by acid, alkali, and certain metallic\r\nsalts, it enters into combination with one or more proportions of\r\nwater, forming cellulose hydrates of varying complexity. This change is\r\nusually termed hydrolysis.\r\n\r\nWith mineral acids like sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, cellulose,\r\nif boiled in weak solutions, is converted into a non-fibrous brittle\r\nsubstance having the composition\r\n\r\n                    C_{12}H_{20}O_{10} 2 H_{2}O\r\n\r\nto which the name _hydra-cellulose_ has been given. Similar changes\r\noccur, but at a much slower rate, when cellulose is in contact with\r\nfree acids at ordinary temperatures. For this reason it is important\r\nthat paper, when finished, should not be contaminated with free acid.\r\n\r\nThe nature and extent of the chemical change can be varied by altering\r\nthe strength of the acid and the conditions of treatment. The\r\nmanufacture of _parchment_ paper is an example of the practical utility\r\nof the chemical reaction between cellulose and acid. A sheet of paper\r\nis dipped into a mixture of three parts of strong sulphuric acid and\r\none part of water, when it becomes transparent. Left in the solution it\r\ndissolves, but if taken out and dipped into water in order to wash off\r\nthe acid the reaction is stopped, and a tough semi-transparent piece of\r\n_parchment_ is obtained. The cellulose is more or less hydrated, having\r\nthe composition\r\n\r\n                C_{12}H_{20}O_{10} H_{2}O,\r\n\r\na substance having the name _amyloid_.\r\n\r\n_Oxidation._--Cellulose is only oxidised to any appreciable extent by\r\nacid and alkali if treated under severe conditions. It is remarkable\r\nthat the processes necessary for isolating paper pulp from plants when\r\ndigested with these chemical reagents do not act upon or destroy the\r\nfibre, and this capacity for resisting oxidation has rendered cellulose\r\nextremely valuable to many of the most important industries.\r\n\r\nThe resistant power of the cellulose is, however, broken down by the\r\nuse of acid and alkali in concentrated form.\r\n\r\nOxalic and acetic acids are obtained when cellulose is heated strongly\r\nat 250° C. with solid caustic soda.\r\n\r\nOxy-cellulose, a white friable powder, is produced by means of strong\r\nmineral acids. Nitric acid at 100° C. attacks the fibre very readily\r\nand produces about 30-40 per cent. of the oxidised cellulose.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELLULOSE DERIVATIVES.\r\n\r\nThe great number of compounds and derivatives, _i.e._, substances\r\nobtained by chemical treatment, may be judged from the following list.\r\nThe substances of commercial importance are suitably distinguished from\r\nthose of merely scientific interest by the printing of the names in\r\nsmall capitals.\r\n\r\n  ACETIC ACID.--An important commercial product obtained by the\r\n      destructive distillation of wood. The crude pyroligneous acid is\r\n      first neutralised with chalk or lime, and the calcium acetate\r\n      formed then distilled with sulphuric acid. Wood yields 5 to 10\r\n      per cent. of its weight of acetic acid according to the nature of\r\n      the wood.\r\n\r\n  ACETONE.--A solvent for resins, gums, camphor, gun cotton, and other\r\n      cellulose products. Prepared by distilling barium or calcium\r\n      acetate in iron stills, the acetate being obtained from the crude\r\n      acetic acid produced by the dry distillation of wood.\r\n\r\n  _Acid Cellulose._--(See Hydral-Cellulose.)\r\n\r\n  _Adipo-Cellulose._--A distinct compound cellulose present in the\r\n      complex cuticular tissue of plants, and separated easily by\r\n      suitable solvents from the wax and oily constituents also present.\r\n\r\n  ALKALI CELLULOSE.--When cotton pulp is intimately mixed with strong\r\n      caustic soda solution, this compound is formed. It is utilised in\r\n      the manufacture of _Viscose_.\r\n\r\n  _Amyloid._--Strong sulphuric acid acts upon cellulose and converts it\r\n      into a gelatinous semi-transparent substance to which the name\r\n      amyloid has been given. (See Parchment Paper.)\r\n\r\n  BALLISTITE.--A smokeless powder composed of nearly equal parts of\r\n      nitro-glycerine and nitrated cellulose, with a small quantity of\r\n      diphenylamine.\r\n\r\n  _Carbohydrate._--A large number of important commercial products,\r\n      such as cellulose, sugars, starches, and gums, consist of the\r\n      elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, associated in varying\r\n      proportions. The ratio of hydrogen to oxygen in these compounds\r\n      is always 2:1 (H_{2} and O).\r\n\r\n                    Cellulose    C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}.\r\n                    Sugar        C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}.\r\n                    Dextrin _n_ (C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}).\r\n\r\n  To all these substances the term carbohydrate is applied.\r\n\r\n  _Celloxin_ (Tollens).--A substance having the stated composition\r\n      C_{8}H_{6}O_{6} considered to be present in oxidised derivatives\r\n      of cellulose.\r\n\r\n  CELLULOID.--This well-known material is made by incorporating camphor\r\n      with nitro-cellulose, a plastic ivory-like substance being\r\n      produced. In practice the process is as follows:--Wood pulp or\r\n      wood pulp paper is saturated with a mixture of sulphuric acid\r\n      (five parts) and nitric acid (two parts), which produces nitrated\r\n      cellulose. The product is washed, ground, and mixed with camphor,\r\n      the mastication being effected by heavy iron rollers. The mass\r\n      thickens and can be removed in the form of thick sheets. These\r\n      sheets are submitted to great pressure between steam-heated\r\n      plates. The cake obtained is cut into sheets of any desired\r\n      thickness, seasoned by prolonged storage, and afterwards worked\r\n      up into boxes, combs, brush-backs, and many other domestic\r\n      articles of a useful and ornamental character.\r\n\r\n  CELLULOSE ACETATE (Cross).--If cellulose is heated with acetic\r\n      anhydride at 180° C., viscous solutions of the acetates are\r\n      obtained. The process yielding a definite acetate of commercial\r\n      value is based upon the following reaction:--100 parts of\r\n      cellulose prepared from the sulpho-carbonate are mixed with\r\n      120 parts of zinc acetate, heated and dried at 105° C. Acetic\r\n      anhydride is added in small quantity, and 100 parts of acetyl\r\n      chloride. At a temperature of 50° C. the mixture becomes liquid,\r\n      and cellulose acetate is subsequently obtained as a white powder.\r\n\r\n  The compound can be used in the place of cellulose nitrate, and,\r\n      being non-explosive, may gradually replace the latter in many\r\n      industrial applications.\r\n\r\n  _Cellulose-Benzoate._--When alkali cellulose is heated with benzoyl\r\n      chloride and excess of caustic soda, this substance is obtained.\r\n\r\n  _Cellulose Hydrate._--The substances produced by the action of acid\r\n      and alkali on cellulose under certain strictly defined conditions\r\n      are bodies containing cellulose united with water to form\r\n      hydrates. The industrial applications of cellulose based upon\r\n      this reaction are described under the special headings.\r\n\r\n  CELLULOSE NITRATE.--A considerable number of derivatives are obtained\r\n      by bringing cellulose into contact with nitric acid. Variations\r\n      in the strength of the acid, the temperature of reaction, and the\r\n      time of contact determine the nature of the product. The best\r\n      known nitrates are:--\r\n\r\n        Cellulose di-nitrate.\r\n\r\n        Cellulose tri-nitrate and tetra-nitrate, present chiefly in\r\n          pyroxyline.\r\n\r\n        Cellulose penta-nitrate.\r\n\r\n        Cellulose hexa-nitrate, the chief constituent of gun-cotton.\r\n\r\n  CHARCOAL.--Not a cellulose derivative in the strict sense of the\r\n      term, charcoal being a residue obtained in the dry distillation\r\n      of wood.\r\n\r\n  COLLODION.--A soluble nitrate of cellulose used in photography. (See\r\n      Pyroxyline.)\r\n\r\n  CORDITE.--A smokeless powder consisting mainly of nitro-glycerine\r\n      and gun-cotton mixed with acetone. The materials are thoroughly\r\n      incorporated and the resultant paste formed into threads which\r\n      are dyed and then cut up into suitable lengths for cartridges.\r\n\r\n  _Cuto-Cellulose._--Synonymous with adipo-cellulose.\r\n\r\n  _Dextron._--A compound prepared from the waste liquors of the\r\n      bisulphite process used for the manufacture of wood pulp.\r\n      Resembles dextrin in its physical properties.\r\n\r\n  DEXTROSE.--A carbohydrate which can be obtained by the action of\r\n      mineral acids on cellulose. Commercial dextrose, or glucose, is\r\n      prepared by the conversion of starch with sulphuric acid. The\r\n      starch is mixed with dilute acid at a fixed temperature, and the\r\n      starch milk obtained poured gradually into a vessel containing\r\n      dilute acid, which is maintained at boiling point. The conversion\r\n      is complete and rapid.\r\n\r\n  EXPLOSIVES.--The production of the several cellulose nitrates has\r\n      given rise to a great number of highly explosive substances.\r\n\r\n        _Blasting Gelatine._--A mixture of nitro-glycerine with\r\n      cellulose nitrates.\r\n\r\n        _Amberite_, _Ballistite_, _Cordite_, and other smokeless\r\n      powders, consisting of nitro-glycerine and cellulose nitrates in\r\n      about equal proportions.\r\n\r\n        _Sporting powders_ made by mixing nitro-cellulose with\r\n      barium nitrate, camphor nitro-benzene, such as _indurite_,\r\n      _plastomenite_, etc.\r\n\r\n  GLUCOSE.--(See Dextrose.)\r\n\r\n  GUN-COTTON.--An explosive prepared by the action of nitric acid on\r\n      cotton. Selected cotton waste suitably opened up is immersed\r\n      in a mixture of three parts of nitric acid by weight (1·50 sp.\r\n      gr.) and one part of sulphuric acid by weight (1·85 sp. gr.) and\r\n      submitted to a number of processes by which the nitration is\r\n      properly effected so as to produce a nitro-cellulose of uniform\r\n      composition. The material is washed, reduced to pulp, and moulded\r\n      into various forms.\r\n\r\n  _Hemi-Cellulose._--The constituents of plant tissues are extremely\r\n      varied in character. Many plants contain substances which\r\n      resemble true cellulose, but differing from it in being easily\r\n      converted by hydrolysis, and by the action of dilute acids,\r\n      into carbohydrates. Plants which contain a large proportion of\r\n      such constituents are termed hemi-celluloses. In some cases\r\n      certain crystallisable sugars can be obtained by hydrolysis under\r\n      suitable conditions.\r\n\r\n  _Hydral-Cellulose_ (Bumcke).--A compound of merely scientific\r\n      interest, resulting from the treatment of cellulose with hydrogen\r\n      peroxide. When acted upon by alkali it is decomposed into\r\n      cellulose and acid cellulose, the latter a derivative of unstable\r\n      composition.\r\n\r\n  _Hydro-Cellulose._--This product, a white, non-structureless, friable\r\n      powder, is obtained by treating cellulose with hydrochloric or\r\n      sulphuric acid of moderate strength. The substance itself has\r\n      no commercial value, but the reaction is useful in separating\r\n      cotton from animal fabrics. If a woollen cloth containing cotton\r\n      is soaked in dilute sulphuric acid, washed, and dried at a gentle\r\n      heat, the cotton is acted upon, and can be beaten out of the\r\n      fabric, the wool resisting the acid treatment.\r\n\r\n  _Lignin._--The complex mixture of substances which is associated\r\n      with cellulose in wood, jute, and other _ligno-celluloses_. The\r\n      conversion of wood into chemical pulp effects the removal of this\r\n      material more or less completely. The well-known \"phloroglucine\"\r\n      test for mechanical wood in papers is based upon the presence of\r\n      _lignin_ in the wood.\r\n\r\n  _Ligno-Cellulose._--Wood and jute are typical bodies consisting of\r\n      cellulose and complex non-cellulose, generally described as\r\n      lignin, associated together in the plant tissue. The chemistry\r\n      of the non-cellulose portion of wood is a matter still under\r\n      investigation, its importance from a commercial point of view\r\n      being obvious from the fact that the removal of the _lignin_\r\n      during the conversion of the wood into wood-cellulose results in\r\n      a loss of 50 per cent. of the weight of wood.\r\n\r\n  _Lustra-Cellulose._--Synonymous with and suggested as a more\r\n      appropriate name for the material usually described as\r\n      _artificial silk_.\r\n\r\n  MERCERISED COTTON.--When cotton is immersed in strong solutions of\r\n      caustic soda a remarkable change sets in. The physical structure\r\n      of the fibre is entirely altered from the long flattened tube\r\n      having a large central canal to a shorter cylindrical tube in\r\n      which the canal almost disappears. Hydration of the cellulose\r\n      takes place, and these changes are taken advantage of in the\r\n      production of mercerised cloth (so named from the discoverer of\r\n      the reaction, Mercer). Cotton goods, particularly those made of\r\n      long stapled cotton, when mercerised, exhibit a beautiful lustre,\r\n      and some magnificent crêpon effects are obtained by the process.\r\n\r\n  _Methoxyl._--A constituent of the complex compound known as\r\n      ligno-cellulose, which is present in wood and similar fibres.\r\n      The amount of methoxyl in lignified tissue can be accurately\r\n      determined, and it has been suggested that the proportion of\r\n      methoxyl found in a cheap printing paper could be used as a\r\n      measure of mechanical wood pulp present.\r\n\r\n  _Muco-Cellulose._--This term is applied to certain compound\r\n      celluloses present chiefly in mucilages, gums, and in\r\n      seaweeds (Algæ). The natural substances are all of commercial\r\n      importance--Iceland moss, Carragheen, Algin, etc.\r\n\r\n  NAPHTHA.--One of the products of the dry distillation of wood,\r\n      usually described as wood-naphtha, or wood spirit.\r\n\r\n  NITRO-CELLULOSE.--The treatment of cellulose with nitric acid gives\r\n      a number of nitro-celluloses according to the conditions of the\r\n      process. (See Cellulose Nitrates.)\r\n\r\n  OXALIC ACID.--A substance of great commercial importance prepared\r\n      by heating the sawdust of soft wood, such as pine, fir, and\r\n      poplar, with strong solutions of mixed caustic soda and potash\r\n      to dryness. The wood yields after six hours a greyish mass\r\n      containing about 20 per cent. of the acid, which is separated out\r\n      by water and then crystallised.\r\n\r\n  It is used for bleaching, and as a _discharge_ in calico printing\r\n      and dyeing.\r\n\r\n  _Oxy-Cellulose._--A white friable powder produced by treating\r\n      cellulose with nitric acid at 100° C. The oxidation of cellulose\r\n      is brought about by several reagents such as chromic acid,\r\n      hypochlorites of lime and soda, chlorine, and permanganates. The\r\n      extent to which cloth has been damaged by overbleaching may be\r\n      determined by a simple test with methylene blue solution, which\r\n      is readily absorbed by oxy-cellulose present in such fabrics.\r\n\r\n  PARCHMENT.--A tough paper prepared by the action of sulphuric acid on\r\n      unsized paper. (See page 137.)\r\n\r\n  _Pectins._--(See Pecto-Cellulose.)\r\n\r\n  _Pecto-Cellulose._--A generic term applied to many important fibrous\r\n      materials, such as flax, straw, esparto, bamboo, phormium,\r\n      ramie, &c., which on alkaline treatment yield cellulose for\r\n      paper-making, and a non-fibrous soluble residue of complex\r\n      composition. These soluble derivatives are known as pectin\r\n      (C_{32}H_{48}O_{32}), pectic acid (C_{32}H_{44}O_{30}), and\r\n      metapectic acid (C_{32}H_{28}O_{36}). Although the soluble\r\n      constituents of the pecto-celluloses amount to 50 per cent. by\r\n      weight in most cases, no process for the recovery of the product\r\n      in a commercial form has yet been devised. (See description of\r\n      Soda recovery, page 78.)\r\n\r\n  PYROXYLINE.--A substance prepared by nitrating cotton. The cotton is\r\n      immersed in a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids of carefully\r\n      regulated strength, and subsequently washed free of the acid.\r\n      Three volumes of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1·429) are diluted with\r\n      two volumes of water and nine volumes of strong sulphuric acid\r\n      (sp. gr. 1·839) added. To the solution when cool the cotton is\r\n      added in small quantities at a time. The resultant pyroxyline\r\n      is soluble in a mixture of equal quantities of alcohol and\r\n      ether, and in the soluble form is utilised as _collodion_ for\r\n      photography.\r\n\r\n  SILK, ARTIFICIAL.--A remarkable substance made from wood or cotton\r\n      cellulose, closely resembling silk in appearance and physical\r\n      properties.\r\n\r\n        Nitrated cellulose is dissolved in a mixture of equal parts of\r\n      alcohol and ether.\r\n\r\n        The solution is forced through five capillary tubes under\r\n      high pressure, and the filament so obtained solidifying at once\r\n      is wound together with other similar filaments upon suitable\r\n      bobbins. Various modifications of this general process are in\r\n      use, such as the solidification of the solution into threads\r\n      by passing it into water; the application of solvents less\r\n      inflammable than ether and alcohol; the use of other forms of\r\n      dissolved cellulose such as those prepared by means of zinc\r\n      chloride, ammoniacal copper oxide, or acetic anhydride. In\r\n      all cases the yarn or thread is submitted to further chemical\r\n      treatment for the removal of nitric acid and to render the\r\n      material non-explosive and less inflammable. The finished product\r\n      is soft and supple, can be easily bleached and dyed, and is\r\n      capable of acquiring a high lustre.\r\n\r\n  SMOKELESS POWDERS.--(See Explosives.)\r\n\r\n  _Sulpho-Carbonate._--(See Viscose.)\r\n\r\n  SULPHATE CELLULOSE.--Chemical wood pulp prepared by the sulphate\r\n      process. (See page 107.)\r\n\r\n  SULPHITE CELLULOSE.--Chemical wood pulp prepared by the sulphite\r\n      process. (See page 107.)\r\n\r\n  VISCOSE.--A soluble sulpho-carbonate of cellulose, prepared by\r\n      treating cellulose with a 15 per cent. solution of caustic soda,\r\n      and shaking the product with carbon bisulphide in a closed\r\n      vessel. The mixture forms a yellowish mass soluble in water,\r\n      giving a viscous solution which has some remarkable and valuable\r\n      properties.\r\n\r\n        This _viscose_, on standing, coagulates to a hard mass which\r\n      can be turned and polished.\r\n\r\n        If spread on glass and coagulated by heat, films are obtained\r\n      from which the alkaline by-products can be washed out. These\r\n      films are transparent, colourless, very tough and hard.\r\n\r\n  VULCANISED FIBRE.--Fibre or pulp treated with zinc chloride in acid\r\n      solution, or otherwise, for the manufacture of hard boards. (See\r\n      page 139.)\r\n\r\n  WILLESDEN GOODS.--Paper, fibre, and textiles when treated with\r\n      cuprammonium oxide are partially gelatinised on the surface and\r\n      rendered waterproof. (See page 139.)\r\n\r\n  _Wood Spirit._--(See Naphtha.)\r\n\r\n  _Xylonite._--(See Celluloid.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFIBRES FOR PAPER-MAKING.\r\n\r\nAlthough the vegetable world has been explored from time to time for\r\nnew supplies of cellulose, and some plants have been found serviceable\r\nin certain directions, yet the number of fibres in actual use is very\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\nThe following table indicates the principal sources of the material\r\nrequired for paper-making:--\r\n\r\n  --------+----------------------------+--------------------------------\r\n   Fibre. |    Source of the Fibre.    |   Application of the Fibre.\r\n  --------+----------------------------+--------------------------------\r\n  Linen   | Rags, textile waste.       | High class writings and\r\n          |                            | printings.\r\n  Cotton  | Rags, textile waste.       | High class writings and\r\n          |                            | printings.\r\n  Esparto | Natural grass.             | Writings and printings.\r\n  Straw   | Straw from various         | Printings, box and card boards.\r\n          | cereals--wheat, barley,    |\r\n          | oats, etc.                 |\r\n  Wood    | Mechanically ground wood.  | Cheap papers, boxboards,\r\n          |                            | middles, tickets and cards,\r\n          |                            | writings and printings.\r\n    \"     | Chemically prepared wood.  | Writings and printings.\r\n  Flax    | Threads, waste from        | Wrappings, boards, cable\r\n          | spinning mills.            | papers.\r\n  Hemp    | Spinning refuse, old rope, | Wrappings, boards, cable\r\n          | sailcloth, etc.            | papers, strong writings.\r\n  Jute    | Waste, old gunny bags.     | Wrappings, boxboard, cards.\r\n  Bamboo  | Natural stems.             | Writings and printings (not in\r\n          |                            | Europe, and only limited\r\n          |                            | quantities elsewhere).\r\n  Ramie   | Bast fibres of the plant;  | Rarely used, except in special\r\n          | textile refuse.            | cases.\r\n  Bagasse | Sugar-cane refuse.         | Common papers (chiefly\r\n          |                            | experimental results).\r\n  Manila  | Textile and rope refuse.   | Wrappings, cable papers.\r\n    Hemp  |                            |\r\n  --------+----------------------------+--------------------------------\r\n\r\n_Exploiting New Fibres._--The exploitation of any new paper-making\r\nfibre requires attention to certain important details, which may be\r\nfairly considered in the following order:--\r\n\r\n(1) _Supply._--The supply of material must be plentiful and obtainable\r\nin large quantities. Too often this question is entirely neglected by\r\nthose who bring new fibres to the notice of paper-makers, probably\r\nbecause they do not realise that enormous quantities of material are\r\nnecessary to supply even a very small section of the paper trade,\r\nthe fact being that few plants yield more than half their weight of\r\npaper-making fibre.\r\n\r\n(2) _Suitability._--The fibre should be properly examined as to\r\nits chemical and physical properties in a laboratory equipped with\r\nappliances for its conversion into bleached paper pulp on a small\r\nscale. The examination of the fibre would include tests as to the\r\namount of pulp which can be obtained from one ton of raw material, the\r\napproximate cost of treatment, and details as to the value of the fibre\r\nfor paper-making.\r\n\r\n(3) _Cost of Raw Material._--If the supply of material seems to be\r\nsufficient, and the paper pulp obtained possesses suitable qualities,\r\nthen it is necessary to get accurate information as to the cost of the\r\nfibre delivered to some given spot at or near the place of collection.\r\n\r\nThe exploitation of any new fibre for paper-making purposes will\r\ninvolve a recognition of the fact that the raw material must be\r\nconverted into pulp at or near the place where the material is most\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nThe only interesting exception to this is the case of esparto\r\nfibre, which is imported into England in large amount, but this is\r\nonly possible because esparto possesses most valuable paper-making\r\nqualities, and is obtained in countries close to England, where large\r\nquantities are consumed. It is doubtful whether other fibres could be\r\nutilised in the same way.\r\n\r\n(4) _The Cost of Manufacture_ at or near the place of collection\r\nrequires to be carefully worked out, due consideration being given\r\nto the actual cost of chemicals on the spot, cost of labour, and the\r\nconditions under which the maintenance of machinery can be efficiently\r\nlooked after.\r\n\r\n(5) _Carriage and Freight Charges_ are the last, but by no means the\r\nleast, items of importance. It is not too much to say that the whole\r\nsuccess of the exploitation of new paper-making fibre hangs entirely\r\nupon this item, the majority of many fibres which have been brought to\r\nthe notice of the trade being suitable, but impracticable, solely on\r\naccount of these and similar commercial considerations.\r\n\r\nIn the pages of the trade press for the last few years the following\r\nfibres have been noticed:--\r\n\r\n(1) _Flax Pulp._--This material was to be obtained from flax straw.\r\nAttempts were made on a commercial scale to produce quantities of flax\r\nfibre, but so far the efforts made have not been very successful.\r\n\r\n(2) _Ramie Fibre._--This material has been exploited over and over\r\nagain, chiefly for textile trades, its application as a paper-making\r\nmaterial being limited to small quantities used for special purposes\r\nsuch as bank notes. The fibre is too valuable, except for textile\r\nindustries, and can only come into the paper trade as a waste material\r\nfrom such sources.\r\n\r\n(3) _Tobacco Fibre_ has been before the trade for some years, the\r\nidea being to utilise tobacco stems and other tobacco waste for\r\nthe manufacture of paper suitable for use as wrappers for cigars,\r\ncigarettes, and similar purposes.\r\n\r\n(4) _Agave Fibre._--This name is given to a large and important genus\r\nof fibre-yielding plants found chiefly in Central America. It is also\r\nfound in India, and in 1878 an experiment was made for the manufacture\r\nof paper at a mill near Bombay, but this did not give any satisfactory\r\nresults, probably on account of the primitive methods used in treatment.\r\n\r\n(5) _Bagasse._--The waste material from sugar-cane has been looked upon\r\nfor many years as a desirable fibre, much time and labour having been\r\ngiven to the utilisation of this material. In spite of these efforts\r\nbagasse still remains an almost useless and unworkable material. This\r\nis partly due to inferiority of the pulp and partly due to difficulties\r\nconnected with its treatment. Probably cultivation of the plant for the\r\nsake of its fibre instead of the sugar might give better results.\r\n\r\n(6) _Peat._--The attempts made to utilise peat for paper-making are\r\nprobably fresh in the minds of those paper-makers interested in the\r\nproduction of wrappers and boxboards. The nature of peat, however, is\r\nsuch as to exclude the hope of making any useful article. The material\r\nhas been exploited by companies in Austria, Ireland, and Canada on a\r\nfairly large scale, with but a limited amount of success.\r\n\r\n(7) _Cotton-seed Hulls._--Many patents have been taken out for the\r\nchemical treatment of cotton-seed waste and having for their object the\r\nremoval of the particles of seed hulls, so as to obtain a pure cotton\r\npulp. The scheme sounds attractive, but there are so many conditions\r\nwhich have to be taken account of that the commercial success of any\r\nundertaking based on the use of cotton-seed hulls is very questionable.\r\nThe fact is that the hulls have a market value quite apart from the\r\npossibility of their application to paper-making, and this initial cost\r\nwould prevent paper-makers from buying the material owing to the large\r\nquantity necessary for the manufacture of one ton of pure pulp.\r\n\r\n(8) _Apocynum._--This plant is said to be utilised to some extent by\r\nthe Russian Government in the manufacture of bank notes, the plant\r\nbeing cultivated at Poltava. This is an instance of the particular\r\napplication of a fibrous material in limited quantities, a proposition\r\nwhich is always feasible in the case of special requirements.\r\n\r\n(9) _Cornstalk._--This fibre has been chiefly exploited in America,\r\nexperts having been attracted by the enormous quantities of cornstalk\r\navailable in the several wheat-producing States. The manufacture\r\nof paper pulp from this material on a large scale has yet to be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n(10) _Japanese Paper Fibres._--In Eastern countries a great number of\r\nfibrous plants are utilised in small quantities for the manufacture\r\nof special papers. It is obvious that in these Eastern countries the\r\nemployment of fibres which are not cultivated in large bulk is readily\r\npossible when the question of price obtained for the paper and the\r\ncost of production are considered. Of such fibres may be mentioned the\r\n_Mitsumata_ and _Kodzu_, easy of cultivation and giving a good yield\r\nof material per acre of ground. The waxed papers used for stencils in\r\nduplicating work on the typewriter are made from these fibres. The\r\n_paper Mulberry_ is also a well-known fibre; while a third species\r\nparticularly valuable for thin papers is the _Gampi_.\r\n\r\n(11) _Antaimoto Fibre._--The bark of this shrub is utilised in\r\nMadagascar in very small quantities for local purposes and possesses\r\nlittle interest for paper-makers.\r\n\r\n(12) _Refuse Hempstalk._--The suggestion of the use of this material\r\ncomes from Italy, the hempstalk having been experimented with at San\r\nCesario Mill. This also is a fibre of a local interest only. The\r\npercentage of cellulose is very high, being over 50 per cent.\r\n\r\n(13) _Papyrus._--The revival of this celebrated material is of\r\ncomparatively recent date. It should be noted that the manufacture\r\nof papyrus as carried out by the Egyptians, by smoothing out layers\r\nof bark in order to utilise them as sheets of paper, and the present\r\nday proposals which involve the production of paper pulp from papyrus,\r\nare two entirely different propositions, and the success of the old\r\nEgyptian method cannot be referred to as any assurance of success\r\nfor the production of paper from papyrus along modern lines. The\r\nexploitation of this fibre must follow the lines of modern research\r\nand commercial investigation, and its value, if any, could then be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n(14) _Pousolsia._--This is a fibre of the same family as hemp and\r\nramie. The value of this material is at present unknown, but the\r\nultimate fibre appears to possess a most extraordinary length. Very\r\nlittle information is available at present as to its value for\r\npaper-making.\r\n\r\n(15) _Bamboo._--This material has been before the paper trade for many\r\nyears, having first been exploited seriously by Mr. Thomas Routledge in\r\n1875. Since that date a good deal of work has been done in connection\r\nwith the fibre, but not until recently has the investigation been made\r\nof a sufficiently extensive character to enable paper-makers to form\r\nsome conclusions as to the best methods of obtaining a reliable paper\r\npulp. The researches of the writer in India go to prove that with any\r\nfibre it is necessary to take into account all the factors likely to\r\naffect the final cost of the paper pulp delivered to any given paper\r\nmill.\r\n\r\nThe figures given in a report recently published, \"The Manufacture\r\nof Paper and Paper Pulp in Burma,\" show the necessity of thorough\r\ninvestigation into all the points likely to affect the final results,\r\nviz., the price at which the paper pulp can be sold in England,\r\nassuming that the fibre in question is suitable for the manufacture of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Examination of Fibres._--The exact chemical analysis of a new fibre\r\nis necessary in order to establish completely its value for textile and\r\npaper-making purposes, but the investigation of the suitability of the\r\nfibre for paper-making may be simplified by simple reduction of the raw\r\nmaterial with caustic soda. The following process is sufficient for all\r\npractical purposes:--\r\n\r\n_Condition of Sample._--A record should be made of the general\r\nappearance of the sample, its condition and the amount available for\r\nthe investigation. Any information available as to the source of supply\r\nand the growth of the plant should also be noted.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Sample._--The material is cut up into small pieces. The\r\nmost convenient appliance for this purpose is a mitre cutter as used by\r\npicture-frame makers. If the sample is a piece of wood, sections one\r\ninch thick cut across the grain of the wood are most suitable, as they\r\ncan be readily cut up into thin flakes by this machine.\r\n\r\n_Moisture in Sample._--A small average sample should be dried at 100°\r\nC. for the determination of moisture.\r\n\r\n_Treatment with Caustic Soda._--About two hundred grams of the raw\r\nmaterial is closely packed into a small digester or autoclave and\r\ncovered with a solution of caustic soda having a specific gravity of\r\n1·050. A perforated lead disc should be placed above the sample in the\r\ndigester to prevent any of it from floating above the level of the\r\nsolution. The material should be digested for five or six hours at a\r\npressure of 50 lbs. The conditions of treatment here given will need to\r\nbe varied according to the nature of the fibre. Some materials can be\r\nreadily converted into pulp with weaker liquor and at a lower pressure,\r\nwhile others will require prolonged treatment. These conditions must be\r\nvaried according to judgment or according to the effects produced by\r\nthe conditions already set out.\r\n\r\n_Unbleached Pulp._--The contents of the digester are emptied out into\r\nan ordinary circular sieve provided with a fine copper wire bottom,\r\nhaving a mesh of about sixteen to the inch. The sieve is immersed in\r\nwater and the contents partially washed with hot water. The partially\r\nwashed material is squeezed out by hand and tied up in a strong cloth\r\nand then kneaded thoroughly by hand in a basin of water which is\r\nrepeatedly renewed until the fibre is thoroughly washed. The process of\r\nkneading at the same time reduces the fibre to the condition of pulp.\r\nThe water is carefully squeezed out of the pulp by hand, and the moist\r\npulp is then divided into two equal parts, the first of which is made\r\nup into sheets of any convenient size, care being taken that none of\r\nthe fibre is lost. These sheets are then dried in the air and preserved\r\nas samples of unbleached pulp, a record being made of the weight\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n_Bleached Pulp._--The second portion of the moist pulp is mixed with\r\na solution of bleach, the strength of which has been accurately\r\ndetermined by the usual methods. The amount of bleach added should\r\nbe about 20 per cent. of the weight of air-dry fibre present in the\r\nmoist sample of pulp. The pulp should be bleached at a temperature\r\nnot exceeding 38° C., and when the colour has reached a maximum the\r\namount of bleach remaining in solution is ascertained by titration with\r\nstandard arsenic solution. In this way the amount of bleaching powder\r\nrequired to bleach the pulp is determined. The product is then made up\r\ninto sheets of pulp which are dried by exposure to air and subsequently\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\n_Yield of Pulp._--The percentage yield of finished pulp obtained from\r\nthe raw material is determined from the figures arrived at in the\r\nexperiment described, and the weight of raw material necessary to\r\nproduce one ton of bleached pulp is readily calculated.\r\n\r\n_Examination of Bleached Fibre._--The fibre should be carefully\r\nexamined under the microscope and a record made of general microscopic\r\nfeatures, especially with reference to the length and diameter of the\r\nfibres, and the proportion of cellular matter present, if any.\r\n\r\n_Sample of Paper._--It is only in the case of short-fibred material\r\nsimilar to esparto and straw that sheets of paper capable of giving\r\ncomparative results as to strength can be made. The figures obtained\r\nwith fibrous materials of this kind are only comparative, because it is\r\npossible in practice to make a much stronger sheet of paper when the\r\nmaterial is beaten properly under normal conditions.\r\n\r\nA similar investigation should be made by submitting the fibre to\r\ntreatment with bisulphite of lime, that is to say, if the fibre lends\r\nitself to such a process. A lead-lined digester is necessary, and the\r\nsolution employed is bisulphite of lime prepared according to the\r\ndirections given on page 160.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of sulphite pulp requires more attention than the\r\nmanufacture of soda pulp. It is most important that the digester\r\nshould be absolutely tight in order to prevent the escape of any free\r\nsulphurous acid gas, and the contents of the digester must be heated\r\nslowly until the maximum pressure has been reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER FROM RAGS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--A Rag Sorting House.]\r\n\r\nThe word rag is used to designate a very wide range of raw material\r\nsuitable for conversion into paper. In the case of high-class hand-made\r\nwriting papers only the best qualities are employed, such as new linen\r\nand cotton cuttings from factories, or well-sorted rags of domestic\r\norigin. The usual classification adopted by merchants who supply the\r\npaper mills is somewhat as follows:--\r\n\r\n    New white linen cuttings (from textile factories).\r\n    New white cotton cuttings (from textile factories).\r\n    Fine whites (domestic rags).\r\n    Outshots (a quality between fines and seconds).\r\n    Seconds (a grade inferior to fines).\r\n    Thirds (inferior and dirty well-worn rags).\r\n    Coloured prints (of all grades and colours).\r\n    Fustians and canvas.\r\n    Manila and hemp rope.\r\n    Baggy, gunny, and jute.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of rag used in England for paper-making is not known.\r\nThe only figures available refer to rags _imported_; and these cannot\r\nbe regarded as a measure of consumption, which could only be arrived at\r\nby first ascertaining the quantity of _home rags_ used. The imports of\r\nrag at stated periods are given in the appended table:--\r\n\r\nRAGS IMPORTED INTO ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n  --------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n        --      |   1872.  |   1882.  |   1892.  |   1902.  |   1905.\r\n  --------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n  Weight (tons) |  22,254  |  21,200  |  23,032  |  18,692  |  23,681\r\n                |          |          |          |          |\r\n  Value         | £373,035 | £303,349 | £214,065 | £173,732 | £224,232\r\n  --------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\n_Sorting and Cutting._--All rags on arrival at the mill are carefully\r\nsorted. This process is conducted entirely by women, who sort and cut\r\nup the rags at special tables provided with cutting knives curved in\r\nshape similar to a scythe. These are fixed at an angle in the centre\r\nof the table, with the back towards and in front of each work-woman.\r\nThe top of the table is made of thick coarse wire so that some of the\r\ndirt and foreign impurities may fall through. All buttons, hooks and\r\neyes, pins, leather, pieces of rubber, and other articles are carefully\r\nremoved, while seams and hems are also opened out. The rags are cut\r\ninto slips 3-5 inches long and then recut crosswise, and thrown into\r\nsuitable baskets or receptacles standing round the table, by which\r\nmeans the _sorting_ operation is effectually carried out. The care and\r\nattention given to the sorting is an important item in the manufacture\r\nof papers of uniform quality, and in the best mills the sorting is\r\ncarried out to such an extent that twenty or twenty-five grades are\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--A Rag Duster.]\r\n\r\n_Dusting._--The rags are next passed through a machine which removes\r\ndirt. This is a hollow cylindrical or conical drum having an external\r\ncovering of coarse wire cloth, which rotates inside a wooden box.\r\nThe shaft is provided with projecting spikes, so that the rags are\r\nviolently agitated in their passage through the machine. The dirt and\r\nother impurities fall through the wire on to the floor of the room,\r\nwhile the clean rags are discharged from the lower end of the drum. The\r\nloss in weight varies according to the condition of the rags. With good\r\nmaterials the loss may only be 1-2 per cent., while with dirty common\r\nrags the loss during cleaning and dusting may amount to 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--A Rag Cutter.]\r\n\r\n_Boiling._--The further purification of the rags is effected by a\r\nchemical treatment, viz., boiling at a high temperature with alkaline\r\nsubstances, which process removes fatty, glutinous, and starchy matter\r\nfrom the material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Interior of Paper Mill for Hand-made Paper (R.\r\nBatchelor & Sons).]\r\n\r\nFor this purpose a spherical digester is used, generally 7-9 feet\r\ndiameter, and capable of holding 2-2½ tons of rag. The boiler or\r\ndigester is filled with dusted rags, and the requisite amount of\r\nalkaline solution added. The manhole is then closed, and steam admitted\r\nthrough the hollow trunnions until the pressure reaches 20 or 30 lbs.,\r\nat which pressure the boiling is continued for three to six hours\r\naccording to requirements, the digester rotating slowly the whole time\r\nin order that the rags may be evenly and thoroughly boiled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--View of a Rag Boiler, showing connections.]\r\n\r\nThe liquor employed for boiling is a solution of caustic soda,\r\ncarbonate of soda, or milk of lime. In the case of caustic soda the\r\namount required varies from 5 to 10 per cent. of the weight of rag.\r\nCaustic soda is preferable to lime, because it acts upon the grease\r\nand other fatty matters, forming a soluble compound which is freely\r\nremoved in the subsequent process of washing. Many paper-makers,\r\nhowever, use milk of lime, carefully strained through fine cloth,\r\nalmost exclusively. Considerable experience and skill are necessary\r\nin this operation in order to avoid injury to the fibre not only as\r\nregards its strength, but also its colour.\r\n\r\n_Washing._--When the rags have been sufficiently boiled, the steam\r\nis turned off and the pressure allowed to fall. This can be effected\r\nquickly by blowing off from a valve fixed at the bottom of the boiler\r\nopposite to the manhole. The cover is removed from the boiler and the\r\nboiler slowly rotated in order that the contents may be discharged\r\ninto a tank placed below. The \"black liquor,\" as it is called, is\r\nthen drained away from the rags, which are immediately subjected to a\r\npreliminary washing. The process of washing must be carried out in a\r\nthorough manner in order to remove all soluble compounds, which if left\r\nwould cause an unnecessary waste of bleach in the subsequent stages of\r\npurification. There are many schemes employed for washing, most of them\r\nbeing devised with the idea of using a minimum quantity of water.\r\n\r\nThe most general practice, in the absence of special machinery, is the\r\npreliminary treatment in the tank below the digester, followed by a\r\nmore complete washing process in a machine known as a breaking engine.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus is a shallow oval-shaped vessel with circular ends,\r\ndivided lengthwise by a partition called a mid-feather, which, however,\r\ndoes not extend the full length of the apparatus. In one of the two\r\nchannels into which the vessel is thus divided a heavy roll is fitted,\r\nwhich is provided with a number of steel knives. On the floor of this\r\nchannel there is fixed a \"bed-plate,\" also provided with projecting\r\nknives which are parallel with the knives in the roll. The distance\r\nbetween the knives in the roll and those in the \"bed-plate\" may be\r\naltered as required by means of an adjusting screw. In the other\r\nchannel of the breaking engine there is fitted a \"drum-washer,\" which\r\nserves for the removal of the dirty water from the machine. This drum\r\nis divided into sections by means of partitions which reach from the\r\ncentre to the circumference. The surface of the \"drum-washer\" consists\r\nof a fine brass wire cloth supported by a coarser material placed\r\nunderneath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--A Breaking and Washing Engine.]\r\n\r\nThe breaking engine is half filled with clean water, and the rags are\r\nthrown into the engine until it is suitably filled. The rotation of the\r\nheavy roll causes the mixture of rags and water to circulate round the\r\nvessel, the floor of which is so constructed that the pulp is drawn\r\nbetween the roll and \"bed-plate\" and discharged over the \"backfall,\"\r\nwhich is that portion of the sloping floor behind the \"bed-plate.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"drum-washer\" rotates with its surface in contact with the mixture\r\nin the engine, so that the dirty water passes through the wire cloth\r\nand is caught in the curved sections or buckets inside the drum and\r\ndischarged into a trough adjacent to the centre, and thereby conveyed\r\naway from the engine. Clean water is allowed to run into the vessel\r\nat one end while the dirty water is discharged by means of the\r\n\"drum-washer.\" At the same time the rags are broken up by means of the\r\nknives on the roll, so that when the rags are sufficiently washed, a\r\nprocess which usually occupies four hours, they are also partially\r\ndisintegrated.\r\n\r\n_Bleaching._--The clean disintegrated rag is next bleached by means of\r\nordinary bleaching powder solution. Bleaching powder is a substance\r\nprepared by the action of chlorine gas on dry slaked lime, resulting\r\nin the formation of a compound which has the property of bleaching or\r\n\"whitening\" vegetable matters. The clear solution obtained by treating\r\nthe powder with water is utilised by the paper-maker for bleaching the\r\nrag pulp.\r\n\r\nVarious methods are used for this purpose. Sometimes the requisite\r\nvolume of clear bleach liquor is added to the pulp in the breaker,\r\nand the material kept in constant circulation until the operation\r\nhas been completed. In other cases the broken pulp is transferred to\r\na \"potcher,\" which is a vessel similar in shape to the breaker, but\r\nmerely provided with paddles for keeping the pulp in circulation, and\r\nbleached by the addition of chloride of lime solution.\r\n\r\nAnother method frequently adopted is to discharge the pulp from the\r\nbreaker, immediately after the addition of the bleach, into brick or\r\ncement tanks, allowing the bleaching action to proceed spontaneously\r\nwithout prolonged agitation.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the process is hastened by adding dilute sulphuric\r\nacid to the pulp after the bleach liquor has been run in, or by\r\nheating the mixture with steam. For high-class papers such devices as\r\nthis are seldom resorted to, as experience shows that the colour of\r\npulp bleached by drastic methods does not maintain a high standard.\r\n\r\nThe pulp is then thoroughly washed in order to remove every trace\r\nof residual bleach, and also the soluble compounds which have been\r\nformed during the operation. Very large quantities of water, clear\r\nand free from suspended dirt, are necessary. In some mills any excess\r\nof bleach is neutralised by the use of an \"antichlor\" such as sodium\r\nhyposulphite, or sodium sulphite, but the best results are undoubtedly\r\nobtained when the quantity of chemicals used is kept at a minimum.\r\n\r\nIf the pulp is bleached in a breaker or potcher, the washing is\r\neffected by the aid of the drum-washer. With pulp treated in steeping\r\ntanks, fresh water is allowed to percolate or drain slowly through the\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTROLYTIC BLEACHING.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of a sodium hypochlorite solution for the ordinary\r\ncalcium hypochlorite solution obtained from common bleaching powder has\r\nbeen the aim of specialists for many years. As early as 1851 a patent\r\nwas taken out by Charles Watt for decomposing chlorides of the alkali\r\nmetals and the formation of hypochlorites. It was not until 1886 that a\r\npractical method was devised for producing an electrolysed solution of\r\nsalt, but in that year Hermite introduced a continuous process in which\r\nan electrolysed solution having a strength of three grammes chlorine\r\nper litre was passed continuously into the potcher.\r\n\r\nMany patents for the electrolysis of salt have been taken out during\r\nthe last twenty years, of which the Bird-Hargreave process is in\r\noperation in England, the Rhodin process in America, the Siemens and\r\nHalske in Norway, and the Oettel and Haas apparatus in Germany. The\r\nfigures relating to the latter apparatus may be mentioned as typical of\r\nthe present condition of electrolytic bleaching. The apparatus consists\r\nof a narrow rectangular trough divided into a number of chambers\r\nthrough which a solution of brine flows at a constant and steady\r\nrate. The electric current is passed through the solution by suitable\r\nelectrodes, the temperature being kept down by means of a cooling coil.\r\nThe cost of producing the bleach liquor as given by the inventors of\r\nthe apparatus from the results of actual working are shown in the\r\nfollowing table:--\r\n\r\nTABLE GIVING ANALYSIS OF COST FOR PRODUCING BLEACH LIQUOR.\r\n\r\n  Capacity of tank              750 litres = 166 gallons.\r\n  Strength or density of brine  1·5 Baumé, or 23 Twaddell.\r\n        286 lbs. of common salt required for 166 gallons.\r\n\r\n  --------------------+-------+-------+------+-------+--------+--------\r\n  Hours worked        |   2   |   4   |   6  |   8   |   10   |    12\r\n  Grammes of chlorine |       |       |      |       |        |\r\n    per litre produced|  4·35 |  7·38 |  9·9 | 12·42 |  14·31 |  16·20\r\n  Temperature C. of   |       |       |      |       |        |\r\n    brine during      |       |       |      |       |        |\r\n    operation         |   20  |   21  |  20  |   21  |   20   |    20\r\n  Ampères of 110 volts|   55  |   50  |  46  |   52  |   47   |    43\r\n  Power in h.p. hours |   16  |   31  |  45  |   61  |   75   |    89\r\n  Cost of the h.p. at |       |       |      |       |        |\r\n    ·22_d._ per h.p.  |       |       |      |1_s._  |1_s._   |1_s._\r\n    hour              | 3½_d._| 6¾_d._|10_d._| 1½_d._|  4½_d._| 7½_d._\r\n  Cost of salt        |1_s._  |1_s._  |1_s._ |1_s._  |1_s._   |1_s._\r\n                      |  6_d._|  6_d._| 6_d._| 6_d._ |  6_d._ |  6_d._\r\n  Total cost          |1_s._  |2_s._  |2_s._ |2_s._  |2_s._   |3_s._\r\n                      | 9½_d._| 0¾_d._| 4_d._| 7½_d._| 10½_d._| 1½_d._\r\n  Total chlorine      |       |       |      |       |        |\r\n    obtained in kilos.| 3·262 | 5·535 | 7·425| 9·315 | 10·732 | 12·150\r\n  Cost of chlorine per|       |       |      |       |        |\r\n    kilo.             |6·6_d._| 4½_d._|3¾_d._|3·4_d._| 3·2_d._|  3_d._\r\n  Salt used per kilo. |       |       |      |       |        |\r\n    chlorine          |   35  |   20  |  15  |   12  |   10   |    9\r\n  --------------------+-------+-------+------+-------+--------+--------\r\n\r\nThe above costs have been estimated on prices as follows:--\r\n\r\n                    Coal  10_s._ per ton.\r\n                    Salt  12_s._ per ton.\r\n\r\nAfter 12 hours the 166 gallons (750 litres) are converted into\r\nelectrolytic bleach liquor containing 26¾ lbs. of active chlorine\r\n(12·15 kilos.).\r\n\r\n_Beating._--Although the rags are reduced by the breaking engine to a\r\ncondition of fibrous lint, called \"half-stuff,\" they are not fit for\r\nconversion into paper. They have to be _beaten_ in special machinery\r\nuntil a complete separation of the single fibres has been effected,\r\nand this process is rightly regarded by many paper-makers as the most\r\nimportant stage of manufacture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Oettel and Haas' Apparatus for the manufacture\r\nof Electrolytic Bleach Liquor.]\r\n\r\nThe beating engine is similar in construction to the breaking engine,\r\nbut there are certain essential differences in arrangement and\r\nmanipulation. There is usually no drum-washer; the roll contains a\r\nlarge number of knives which are fixed in clumps or sets of three\r\nround the circumference; the lowering of the roll upon the bed-plate\r\nis carefully watched and controlled, and the desired effects are only\r\nobtained by strict attention to the condition of the pulp during the\r\nwhole process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--The \"Hollander\" Beating Engine.]\r\n\r\nThe beater is first partially filled with water, and the drained\r\nhalf-stuff added gradually until the \"furnish,\" a convenient term\r\napplied to the contents of the engine, has the proper consistency,\r\nwhich varies according to the nature and quality of paper required.\r\n\r\nThe mass is circulated steadily round the engine by the action of the\r\nbeater roll, which is lowered from time to time until the distance\r\nbetween the knives on the roll and those on the bed-plate has been set\r\nto the desired adjustment. This lowering of the roll and its proper\r\nadjustment call for the greatest care.\r\n\r\n_Influence of the Beating._--The importance of this operation can\r\neasily be judged from one or two specific examples. In the case of rag\r\npapers the two extremes of variation are represented by the ordinary\r\nblotting paper on the one hand and a hard strong writing paper known\r\nas a _loan_ on the other. Now the great difference in these papers may\r\nbe traced to the careful selection of the rag and the treatment in the\r\nbeater as the two primary causes of the final results.\r\n\r\nFor blotting papers it is essential that the rags should be old and\r\ntender. In the beating operation subsequent to the usual boiling and\r\nbleaching processes the half-stuff is beaten quickly with sharp knives,\r\nthe roll being lowered soon after the engine is filled, so that the\r\nbeating is finished in about one to one and a half hours.\r\n\r\nFor the strong writing paper new strong rags are selected. In the\r\nbeating process the knives used are dull, the roll is lowered slowly\r\nand cautiously, and the beating goes on for eight to ten hours.\r\n\r\nThe effect of such difference in treatment is easily seen by\r\nexamination of the fibres of the papers under the microscope. In\r\nthe first case the fibres appear short with clean cut ends, the\r\nshape little distorted, the structure well defined, bearing a strong\r\nresemblance to the unbeaten material. In the case of the well-beaten\r\npaper the ends of the individual fibres appear to be drawn or frayed\r\nout, the fibres do not possess the sharp well-defined outline\r\ncharacteristic of blotting paper; they are partly split up into\r\nfibrillæ which lie together in a confused mass.\r\n\r\nIn the _blotting_ paper these effects are produced because the knives\r\nbeing sharp cut up the material quickly, and in the _writing_ paper\r\nbecause the dull \"tackle\" tends to draw out the fibres and tear them up\r\nlengthwise.\r\n\r\nThe practical result is a spongy, soft, and bulky blotting and a hard,\r\nstrong, heavy writing paper. Of course the great difference between a\r\nblotting and a writing paper is not all due to this one operation,\r\nbut is obtained by a series of operations, of which one of the most\r\nimportant is, however, the beating.\r\n\r\n_Colouring the Paper._--The pulp is brought to any desired tint by\r\nthe addition of mineral pigments or aniline dyes to the contents of\r\nthe engine. The latter soluble dyes, however, are seldom used for\r\nhigh-class rag papers. Prussian blue, ultramarine, and smalts are\r\nchiefly used for this purpose, giving toned blue, azure, and blue laid\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--The Hand Mould showing Frame and Deckle.]\r\n\r\n_Making the Paper._--The beaten pulp, when duly prepared, is run from\r\nthe engine into store tanks known as stuff chests, ready for the\r\nactual manufacture. The pulp properly diluted with water is strained\r\nthrough special screens to remove any insufficiently beaten material\r\nand any impurities present, after which it is run off into the vat, a\r\nsquare-shaped vessel built of wood or stone.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus used in forming the sheets is called a _hand mould_.\r\nThe mould is a rectangular frame of mahogany upon which is stretched\r\ntightly a fine wire cloth, the surface of the latter being kept flat\r\nby a coarser wire cloth fixed underneath, supplemented by wedge-shaped\r\npieces of wood. A second frame called the _deckle_ fits on to the mould\r\nin such a manner as to form a shallow tray, the bottom of which is the\r\nfine wire cloth.\r\n\r\nThe vatman takes up the mould with both hands and dips it into the\r\nvat full of pulp in a slanting position, drawing it through the stuff\r\ntowards him in a peculiar manner and lifting it out from the vat with\r\na definite quantity of the mixture in the frame. As the water drains\r\naway from the pulp, through the wire cloth, he imparts a shaking motion\r\nto the mould in order to cause the fibres to \"felt\" properly, this\r\nfelting or interlacing of the fibres being an essential feature in the\r\nmanufacture of a good sheet of paper. When the water has drained away\r\nsufficiently from the pulp, the vatman removes the deckle from the\r\nmould and passes the latter over to the coucher, who takes the mould,\r\nreverses it, and presses the contents, which may now be described as a\r\nwet sheet of paper, down on to a damp piece of felt, by which means the\r\npaper is transferred to the felt. He returns the mould to the vatman,\r\nwho meanwhile has made another sheet with a duplicate mould, and then,\r\nhaving laid a second felt upon the wet sheet of paper, he proceeds to\r\ntransfer the next sheet of paper to the second felt. This process is\r\ncontinued until a pile is formed consisting of wet sheets of paper\r\nalternated with pieces of felt.\r\n\r\nThe pile is at once submitted to great pressure in the hydraulic press,\r\nand the excess water slowly forced out, while at the same time the\r\nsheets are compressed and thus \"closed up,\" as it is termed. When all\r\nthe excess water has been removed as far as possible, the pile is taken\r\naway and the sheets of damp paper taken out, the felts being placed in\r\none pile ready for further use, and the sheets of paper in a second\r\nready for the next process.\r\n\r\nThe papers are put back into the press without felts between the sheets\r\nand left for some time. In most cases the sheets are turned round or\r\nmixed in with the sheets of another pile, before pressing. In this way\r\nany unevenness or irregularity in the sheets is counteracted and a more\r\nuniform result obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen these changes are repeated several times the paper acquires an\r\neven texture and becomes firm and hard.\r\n\r\n_Drying the Paper._--The sheets are hung up in the _loft_, as the\r\ndrying room is called, upon poles or ropes. The moisture gradually\r\nevaporates, and the paper is thus dried by exposure to air. In winter\r\nit is necessary to warm the air in the loft, as the air is then\r\nsaturated with moisture. In lofts of limited capacity the air is heated\r\nin order to hasten the process, but the best paper is allowed to dry\r\nnaturally, as by this means the shrinkage is gradual and a maximum\r\nstrength is attained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Apparatus for Sizing Paper in continuous\r\nRolls.]\r\n\r\n_Sizing the Paper._--The dried paper as it leaves the loft is termed\r\n_Waterleaf_ because, being unsized, it readily absorbs water, and\r\ntherefore before it can be used it must be sized. For this purpose\r\nit is dipped into a solution of gelatine, an operation described as\r\n_tub-sizing_ or _animal-sizing_, the former term being used on account\r\nof the tub in which the size is kept, and the latter on account of\r\nthe fact that the gelatine is made from animal matter such as hides,\r\ncartilage, hoofs, and other refuse.\r\n\r\n_Animal Size._--This is prepared from hide pieces, skins, and the\r\nlike by a simple process, which, however, requires a good deal of care\r\nin order to obtain the best results. The material is first thoroughly\r\nwashed in plenty of clean water, and then heated with a definite\r\nquantity of water in a steam jacketed copper pan. The pieces slowly\r\ndissolve until a solution of gelatine is produced, and after the dirt\r\nand impurities have settled to the bottom of the pan the clear liquid\r\nis drawn off into store vessels. There are many details of a technical\r\ncharacter to be attended to in the manufacture of good gelatine, and as\r\nthe process is expensive, considerable attention is demanded at this\r\nstage in the completion of a sheet of paper.\r\n\r\nThe dry sheets of paper are sized by the simple expedient of dipping,\r\nor by the passage of the paper through a long trough. In the first\r\ncase the workman takes up a number of sheets and dips the bunch into a\r\nvat of size at the proper temperature, about 100° Fahrenheit. He then\r\nallows the surplus size to drain off, and the sheets are submitted to a\r\nslight pressure in order to remove the excess of gelatine that will not\r\ndrain off.\r\n\r\nIn the second case a different method is adopted in that the sheets\r\nof paper are carried by travelling felts through a bath of heated\r\nsize, the excess gelatine being removed by the action of rubber or\r\nwooden rollers through which the papers are passed before leaving the\r\napparatus. The papers are quickly and evenly sized by this method,\r\nwhich is now most generally used.\r\n\r\n_Glazing._--When the sheets of paper are quite dry they are ready for\r\nglazing, a process which turns the dull rough surface of the sized\r\nsheet into a highly polished smooth surface fit for use. The sheets are\r\nplaced singly between copper or zinc plates, and a pile of these passed\r\nseveral times through heavy iron rollers, great pressure being applied\r\nto the latter during the operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--A Supercalender.]\r\n\r\nThe amount of polish imparted by this plate-glazing process, as it\r\nis termed, can be varied considerably. With a light pressure and\r\nfew rollings, the sheet of paper can be turned out having a fairly\r\nsmooth surface, and without a conspicuously shiny appearance. By\r\nemploying a great pressure and repeated rolling a much higher surface\r\nis attainable. If the plates are hot a still higher finish is\r\npossible. Machine-made rag papers are glazed usually by means of the\r\nsupercalender, which is a stack of alternate steel and paper rolls\r\nplaced one above the other in a vertical position. The reel of paper\r\npasses between these rolls and becomes highly surfaced.\r\n\r\nThis operation effects many changes in the paper, besides imparting\r\na good finish. The thickness of the sheet is reduced by about 40 per\r\ncent., the fibres being compressed much closer together. The tensile\r\nstrength of the paper is also materially increased, and in every\r\nway the paper is improved. Moderation is essential in this as in\r\neverything, because excess of glazing weakens a paper, rendering it\r\nbrittle and liable to crack when folded.\r\n\r\n_Laid and Wove Papers._--When certain papers are held up to the light\r\nand carefully examined it will be noticed that they appear to contain\r\ndelicate transparent lines running parallel with one another at equal\r\ndistances of about an inch, and that these are intersected by similar\r\ntransparent lines running at right angles, which are much closer\r\ntogether. Such papers are known as _Laid_ Papers, and the peculiar\r\nformation of the transparent lines is due to the construction of the\r\nmould used in the making. The wire surface of this mould consists of a\r\nnumber of somewhat stout wires placed about one inch apart, interwoven\r\nwith finer wires running across and at right angles, which are threaded\r\nmuch closer together. When the mould is dipped into the vat and\r\nwithdrawn, the water drains away from the under surface of the wire,\r\nand the moist pulp settles down on the upper surface; but since the\r\ncoarser wires project a little from the finer threads, the paper is\r\nslightly thinner along those wires, though to an almost infinitesimal\r\nextent, with the result that on drying the sheet appears to contain\r\ntransparent lines.\r\n\r\n_Wove_ papers are so called from the nature of the mould used. The\r\nsurface of the mould in this case consists of fine wires equally\r\ndistributed, being woven in such a manner that the wires are\r\nequidistant from one another, as in ordinary wire gauze. A wove\r\npaper, on being examined in the light, simply shows a number of small\r\ndiamond-shaped spaces, which in the majority of instances are difficult\r\nto detect.\r\n\r\n_The Watermark._--The transparent device observed in many papers when\r\nheld up to the light is known as the watermark, a term probably derived\r\nfrom the conditions existing at the time the sheet of paper is made on\r\nthe mould. The effect is produced by means of a raised design sewn or\r\nsoldered to the surface of the mould, the design being fashioned out of\r\nfine wire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--The First Watermark in Paper.]\r\n\r\nWhen a mould thus fitted with the design is dipped into a vat of pulp\r\nand lifted out, the water falls through the wire, and the pulp sinks\r\ndown on to the surface of the mould, forming a replica, so to speak,\r\nof the design, which is easily seen when the dry paper is held up to\r\nthe light, because the paper is thinner just at those points where the\r\nwires forming the design come into contact with the wet pulp.\r\n\r\nSome of the watermarks are very elaborate and interesting. A familiar\r\nillustration of a beautiful design of this description is to be found\r\nin the Bank of England notes. As a general rule the ordinary watermark\r\nconsists of a mere trade term such as \"Vellum,\" \"Zenobia,\" or of the\r\nname of the manufacturer, such as \"J. Whatman,\" \"R. Batchelor,\" and\r\nso on. In the earlier days of paper-making many highly interesting\r\ndesigns were used, and some of these are still extant. In fact many of\r\nthe names by which certain standard sizes of paper are known owe their\r\norigin to the watermarks employed.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known watermark bears the date A.D. 1301, being in the\r\nform of a globe and cross, as shown. Of equal interest are those\r\ndesigns from which certain papers are called foolscap, crown, pott,\r\npost, royal, columbier, and so on. The watermarks are now little used,\r\nbut the terms are still retained, as indicating the size of the sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICROSCOPIC FEATURES OF COTTON AND LINEN FIBRES.\r\n\r\nThe _cotton_ fibre is about 30 mm. long, with an average diameter of\r\n·025 mm. of tube-like shape, and having a prominent central canal.\r\nThere are no cross markings on the cell walls, and the ends of the\r\nfibre are rounded off into a somewhat blunt point. It exhibits a marked\r\ntendency to twist itself, especially if dry, and this peculiarity is\r\nreadily observed with the raw material.\r\n\r\nThe process of paper-making alters the characteristic structure of the\r\nfibre very greatly. The ends of the fibre are seldom to be seen; the\r\ncurious twist is less prominent, and the fibres are torn and destroyed.\r\nThe effect of the beating process, for example, on cotton is easily\r\nto be noticed by comparing the fibres of a blotting paper under the\r\nmicroscope with the fibres of a _bank_ or _loan_ paper.\r\n\r\nThe distortions produced by prolonged beating renders the\r\ndetermination of the exact percentage of cotton in a rag paper rather\r\ndifficult, but the features to be looked for are the absence of pores,\r\ncross markings, the existence of a central canal, striations produced\r\nin many cases on the cell walls parallel to the length of the fibre.\r\nThe structural features are more readily observed when the fibres are\r\nstained with a suitable reagent. (See page 71.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Cotton.]\r\n\r\nThe _linen_ fibre has an average length of 27 mm. with a diameter of\r\n·02 mm. The raw flax is very different from raw cotton and is easily\r\ndistinguished. The fibre is slender in shape, having thickened knots\r\nat regular intervals throughout its length, the general appearance of\r\nwhich may be compared to a stick of bamboo. The central canal of the\r\nfibre is extremely narrow, running like a small thread through the\r\nlength of the fibre. The cell walls are further marked by numerous\r\npores, which appear as small dark lines running from side to side, but\r\nnot meeting in the centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Linen.]\r\n\r\nIn the treatment necessary for making paper these characteristics are\r\nlargely destroyed, and while it is quite easy to ascertain that a paper\r\nis of linen, or of cotton, or that a paper is mainly cotton with a\r\nsmall percentage of linen, yet there are conditions under which it is\r\ndifficult to determine the exact percentage of cotton or linen in a\r\nrag paper. If, for example, a paper contains nearly equal quantities\r\nof cotton and linen, the exact proportions cannot be determined closer\r\nthan 10 per cent., especially in well-beaten papers.\r\n\r\n\r\nREAGENT FOR STAINING FIBRES.\r\n\r\n_Preparation._--Dissolve 2·1 grams potassium iodide and 0·1 grams\r\niodine in 5 c.c. of water. Mix this solution with a solution containing\r\n20 grams of dry zinc chloride in 10 c.c. of water. Allow the mixture to\r\nstand; pour off the clear liquid into suitable bottles.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORATION PRODUCED.\r\n\r\n  Cotton, linen, hemp.--Wine red.\r\n  Esparto, straw and wood cellulose.--Bluish violet.\r\n  Mechanical wood, unbleached jute.--Yellow.\r\n  Manila hemp.--Blue, bluish grey to yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nESPARTO AND STRAW\r\n\r\n\r\nESPARTO PAPERS.\r\n\r\nThe value of Esparto for the manufacture of high-class printing and\r\nmedium quality writing paper is well known. This material has qualities\r\nwhich cannot readily be obtained from other fibres, such as rag and\r\nwood pulp. It is chiefly used in papers required for lithographic\r\nprinting, books, and art illustration, since it gives a sheet having a\r\ngood surface and one which is soft and flexible.\r\n\r\nThe grass is obtained from Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunis, and Tripoli,\r\nin which countries it grows wild, requiring very little cultivation.\r\nThe condition of the crop is improved by proper treatment, and in\r\ndistricts where the grass is cut for export as a paper-making material\r\nattention is given to cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe plant grows to a height of three or four feet, and when mature the\r\nlong blades of grass curl up into the form of a cylinder resembling a\r\npiece of wire. The leaf consists of two parts, the stalk and a sheath,\r\nwhich are easily separated when harvested. The grass is pulled up by\r\nhand and stacked into heaps in order that it may be dried by the heat\r\nof the sun, after which process it is carefully picked over for the\r\nremoval of all extraneous matter and impurities. It is then graded,\r\nthe best sorts being kept for weaving, and the remainder being sold\r\nfor paper-making. It is packed up into large bales of about 4 cwt.\r\ncapacity, compressed into small bulk by powerful presses, and shipped\r\nto England.\r\n\r\n_Esparto Pulp._--The first process in the manufacture of the paper\r\nis cleaning. The bundles of grass are opened up, shaken out, and put\r\nthrough a willowing machine. This consists of a hollow conical drum,\r\nthe outer surface of which is a coarse wire cloth. Inside the drum is\r\nfitted a shaft provided with wooden teeth, and as the grass passes\r\nthrough it is tossed about and the dust removed. The clean grass is\r\nconveyed by travelling belts to the digester house. For the production\r\nof a high-class paper the grass is often examined by girls, who stand\r\non either side of the travelling conveyer and take out any coarse root\r\nends and foreign material not removed by the willowing machine.\r\n\r\n_Boiling._--The object of submitting esparto to chemical treatment is\r\nto obtain a pure paper-making fibre known as cellulose. The composition\r\nof this raw material is shown by the following analysis:--\r\n\r\n_Spanish Esparto._\r\n\r\n      Cellulose                          48·25\r\n      Water                               9·38\r\n      Aqueous extract                    10·19\r\n      Pectous matter                     26·39\r\n      Fatty matter                        2·07\r\n      Ash                                 3·72\r\n                                        ------\r\n                                        100·0\r\n                                        ------\r\n\r\n      Yield of dry cellulose obtained in actual practice\r\n        from good raw material 45 to 48%\r\n\r\nBy boiling the esparto with caustic soda under pressure for a stated\r\ntime, the non-fibrous constituents are removed, leaving the cellulose\r\nin a more or less pure form according to the severity of the chemical\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--An Esparto Duster.]\r\n\r\nIn practice the grass is packed tightly into upright stationary\r\ndigesters and a definite quantity of caustic soda solution added,\r\nthe amount of chemical used being equal to 15-18 per cent. of the\r\nweight of grass packed into the digester. The form of digester almost\r\nuniversally employed is that known as the Sinclair's \"vomiting\" boiler,\r\nwhich is constructed so that a continuous circulation of the liquid\r\nis maintained by means of what are called \"vomit\" pipes. These are\r\nfitted to the sides of the digester in such a manner that the caustic\r\nsoda solution circulates from the bottom of the digester, up through\r\nthe \"vomit\" pipes, and is discharged downwards upon the contents of\r\nthe boiler through a perforated plate fixed in the upper part of the\r\ndigester. The requisite quantity of caustic soda solution is placed in\r\nthe digester, and steam admitted into the bottom of the vessel while\r\nthe grass is being thrown in. In this way a much larger weight of grass\r\ncan be boiled at one operation, since the bulk is greatly reduced when\r\nthe grass has become thoroughly soft and wet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Sinclair's \"Vomiting\" Esparto Boiler.]\r\n\r\nWhen the boiler is loaded the inlet is closed up and steam turned on\r\nto the full pressure of about 40 or 50 lbs., this being maintained\r\nfor a period of about four hours. The non-fibrous constituents of the\r\nesparto are gradually dissolved out by the caustic soda, and when the\r\noperation is completed the black liquor is run off from the digester\r\ninto large store tanks, and the esparto grass which remains in the\r\ndigester is then completely washed until the soda is almost entirely\r\nwashed out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--A Porion Evaporator.]\r\n\r\nThe conditions for boiling and bleaching esparto are varied by the\r\npaper-maker as circumstances require. A maximum yield of fibre is\r\nobtained when the least possible quantity of caustic soda is used, but\r\na larger percentage of bleaching powder may be necessary to ensure a\r\nwell bleached pulp. The use of an excess of caustic soda is probably\r\nthe general practice for several reasons, amongst which may be noted\r\nthe advisability of guarding against irregularities in the quality\r\nof the esparto, and consequent insufficient boiling, as well as the\r\nadvantage of having some free caustic in the spent liquors to prevent\r\nthe furring up of the tubes of the evaporating apparatus in the soda\r\nrecovery department.\r\n\r\nThe following experiments, given by a contributor to the _Paper Trade\r\nReview_ some years ago, are interesting as showing the effect of\r\nvarying proportions of caustic soda used per unit of grass:--\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS _RE_ YIELD OF AIR-DRY BLEACHED PULP FROM ORAN ESPARTO.\r\n\r\n  Air-dry Pulp containing 10 per cent. water.\r\n\r\n  ---+--------+----------------+------------------+-------+--------+-------\r\n     |Esparto.|  Soda Liquor.  |   Conditions of  |       |  Dry   |\r\n     |        |                |     Boiling.     |Weight | Pulp   |Bleach-\r\n  ---+--------+-------+--------+------+-----+-----+  of   |on Dry  | ing\r\n  No.|   Wt.  |Volume,|   Per  |Time. |Temp.|Pres-|Air-dry|Esparto.|Powder.\r\n     | taken. | C.C.  |  cent. |Hours.|° C. |sure.|Pulp.  |  Per   |  Per\r\n     | Grams. |       |Na_{2}O.|      |     | Lbs.|Grams. | cent.  | cent.\r\n  ---+--------+-------+--------+------+-----+-----+-------+--------+-------\r\n   1 |   200  |  800  |  1·58  |  3   | 142 |  55 | 87·30 |  43·65 |  29·5\r\n   2 |   200  |  800  |  2·13  |  3   | 142 |  55 | 80·67 |  40·33 |  18·5\r\n   3 |   200  |  800  |  2·69  |  3   | 142 |  55 | 72·00 |  36·00 |  10·5\r\n  ---+--------+-------+--------+------+-----+-----+-------+--------+-------\r\n\r\n  No. = No. of Experiment.\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL DATA CALCULATED FROM EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n  ---+------------+----------+------------+-------------+----------------\r\n     |   Boiling. |Weight of |60 per cent.| Bleaching   |For One Ton of\r\n  No.+------+-----+Esparto to|Caustic Soda|  Powder     |Esparto used.\r\n     |Time. |Pres-|give 1 ton|required to |required to  +----------------\r\n     |Hours.|sure.|  Pulp.   |  Digest    |Bleach 1 ton | 60 per |Bleach-\r\n     |      |Lbs. |  Cwts.   | Esparto.   |Air-dry Pulp.| cent.  |ing\r\n     |      |     |          |  Cwts.     |   Cwts.     |Caustic.|Powder.\r\n     |      |     |          |            |             |  Lbs.  | Lbs.\r\n  ---+------+-----+----------+------------+-------------+--------+-------\r\n   1 |   3  |  55 |   45·8   |     4·30   |     5·26    |   210  |   260\r\n   2 |   3  |  55 |   49·5   |     6·27   |     3·39    |   282  |   156\r\n   3 |   3  |  55 |   55·5   |     8·90   |     1·96    |   358  |    79\r\n  ---+------+-----+----------+------------+-------------+--------+-------\r\n\r\n  No. = No. of Experiment.\r\n\r\n_Recovery of Spent Liquor._--As it is possible to recover 75 to 80 per\r\ncent. of the soda originally used in digesting the esparto, the washing\r\nof the boiled grass is conducted on scientific principles in order to\r\nensure a maximum recovery of soda at a minimum cost.\r\n\r\nThe recovery is effected by evaporating down the black liquor, together\r\nwith the washing waters, to a thick syrupy mass, which can be burnt.\r\nThe organic and resinous constituents of the esparto which have been\r\ndissolved out by the caustic soda, forming the soluble soda compounds,\r\nignite readily, and during combustion the organic soda compounds are\r\nconverted more or less completely into crude carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, then, that the cost of recovery depends mainly on the\r\nquantity of weak washing water which has to be evaporated. Consequently\r\nmethods are devised by means of which the grass is thoroughly washed\r\nwith as little water as possible, and some of the methods are very\r\ningenious.\r\n\r\nThe spent liquors and washing waters are evaporated to a small bulk in\r\na vacuum multiple effect apparatus, and the thick liquid mass obtained\r\nby evaporation is burnt either in a rotary furnace or on an ordinary\r\nhearth. Every precaution is taken to effect this operation with a\r\nminimum quantity of coal. The burning off of this mass results in the\r\nformation of a black substance which is taken away from the furnace\r\nand allowed to char or slowly burn until the impure white soda ash, or\r\ncarbonate of soda, is obtained.\r\n\r\nTwo systems of recovery are in general use, which deserve a brief\r\nnotice:--\r\n\r\n_Direct Evaporation._--The liquors may be evaporated to a small bulk\r\nready for incineration by treatment in long shallow pans or furnaces,\r\nthe heat necessary for the process being obtained mainly from the\r\ncombustion of the thick concentrated liquor. The most familiar type of\r\nthis form of apparatus is the Porion evaporator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Scott's Multiple Effect Evaporator.]\r\n\r\nThe combustion of the concentrated liquor is started by a coal furnace\r\nat one end of the apparatus. The thick viscous mass catches fire and\r\nburns with a fierce flame, and the heat is utilised in evaporating the\r\nweaker liquors which flow continuously through shallow brick troughs,\r\nthe surface of which is freely exposed to the heat and flames from the\r\nhearth where the organic soda compounds produced in the boiling of\r\nesparto are being incinerated and converted into soda ash.\r\n\r\nUnder suitable conditions this evaporator is most economical in its\r\nresults. It can be erected cheaply, and when all the heat is fully used\r\nin every possible direction it can be worked at a low cost compared\r\nwith the more modern multiple effect evaporators.\r\n\r\n_Vacuum Multiple Effect Evaporation._--Advantage is taken of the\r\nfact that water boils at a lower temperature in a vacuum than at the\r\nordinary pressure of the atmosphere. There are many forms of apparatus\r\nbased on this principle, amongst which the most recent is Scott's\r\nevaporator. The black liquor from the boilers is pumped through tubes\r\nheated externally by high-pressure steam. The liquor is passed into a\r\nchamber in which a slight vacuum is maintained, so that immediately on\r\nentering, the liquor parts with a good deal of water in the shape of\r\nsteam. The steam liberated is utilised in producing further evaporation\r\nof the partially concentrated liquor, and this operation is repeated\r\nseveral times until the concentration is effected to the desired point.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the actual incineration of the thick liquor is carried\r\nout in a rotary furnace when such an apparatus as this is used.\r\n\r\nEVAPORATION TABLE.\r\n\r\nShowing the volume of liquor obtained by evaporating 1,000 gallons of\r\nweak black lye of density _d_ to a higher density D.\r\n\r\n  -------------+-----------------------------------------------------\r\n  Lower        |  Higher Density D (Twaddell) at 100° F.\r\n  Density _d_  +-----------------------------------------------------\r\n  (at 100° F.).| 20. | 25. | 30. | 35. | 40. | 45. | 50. | 55. | 60.\r\n  -------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n        2      |100  | 80  | 66·6| 57·1| 50  | 44·4| 40  | 36·3| 33·3\r\n        3      |150  |120  |100  |85·7 | 75  | 66·6| 60  | 54·5| 50\r\n        4      |200  |160  |133·3|114·3|100  | 88·8| 80  | 72·7| 66·6\r\n        5      |250  |200  |166·6|143  |125  |111·0|100  | 90·9| 83·3\r\n        6      |300  |240  |200  |171·4|150  |133·3|120  |109  |100\r\n        7      |350  |280  |233·3|200  |175  |155·5|140  |127  |116·6\r\n        8      |400  |320  |266·6|228·6|200  |177·6|160  |145·5|133·3\r\n        9      |450  |360  |300  |257  |225  |200  |180  |163·5|150\r\n       10      |500  |400  |333·3|286  |250  |222  |200  |181·8|166·6\r\n  -------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n\r\n  EXAMPLE:--1,000 gallons of weak liquor at a density of 7° Twaddell\r\n      are reduced to a volume of 200 gallons having a density of 35°\r\n      Twaddell, or to a volume of 140 gallons with a density of 50°\r\n      Twaddell, by evaporation.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Caustic Soda._--The crude soda ash recovered from\r\nprevious boiling operations is dissolved in large lixiviating tanks\r\nand extracted with hot water. The clear solution obtained after\r\nall impurities have been allowed to settle is pumped up into the\r\ncausticising tanks, where it is converted into caustic soda, the loss\r\ndue to the amount of soda not recovered being made up by the addition\r\nof ordinary soda ash. The causticising pans are large circular iron\r\nvessels usually 9 feet diameter and 8 or 9 feet deep, into which a\r\nknown volume of the recovered carbonate of soda solution is placed.\r\n\r\nA weighed quantity of ordinary quicklime is then put into a perforated\r\niron cage which is fixed inside the causticising pan at such a level\r\nthat the whole of the lime is immersed in the solution. The liquor is\r\nkept in constant circulation by means of an agitator and heated to\r\nboiling point, with the result that the chemical reaction sets in,\r\nthe carbonate of soda being converted into caustic soda and the lime\r\nbeing thrown out as chalk. When the operation is completed, the steam\r\nis turned off and the chalk allowed to settle. The clear liquor is\r\ncarefully strained off and pumped up into store tanks from which the\r\nrequired quantities are drawn off into the digesters as circumstances\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n_Washing._--The grass which has been partially washed in the digester\r\nis dug out by the workmen and discharged through a manhole fitted on\r\none side of the digester near the bottom. It is then conveyed in any\r\nconvenient manner to the breaking engine, in which the grass is more\r\ncompletely washed. This important machine has already been described\r\non page 53. The floor of the vessel slopes slightly upward towards\r\nthe front of the roll and falls suddenly behind the roll, in order to\r\npromote a circulation of the contents of the engine round and round the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nA definite weight of boiled grass is thrown into the engine together\r\nwith a large quantity of fresh water. The circulation of the roll draws\r\nthe mixture of pulp and water between the knives, breaking it up and\r\nat the same time discharging it behind the beater roll, and producing\r\na continuous circulation of the mixture in the two sections of the\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nThe dirty water is continuously removed from the vessel by means of a\r\n\"drum-washer.\" This is a large hollow drum, the outer surface of which\r\nconsists of a fine wire cloth, the interior of the washer being fitted\r\nwith specially curved scoops. The drum-washer is lowered until it is\r\nhalf immersed in the mixture of pulp and water, and as it rotates the\r\ndirty water finds its way through the wire cloth, being caught up by\r\nthe internal scoops and discharged through a pipe to a drain outside\r\nthe breaking engine. At the same time fresh water is run into the\r\nvessel at one end, and the continuous washing of the pulp thus effected.\r\n\r\n_Bleaching._--The clean boiled grass is bleached by means of a solution\r\nof chloride of lime.\r\n\r\nThere are several methods used for this purpose, each of which has\r\nspecial advantages of its own, though this is largely a question of\r\nlocal conditions:--\r\n\r\n(A) The pulp can be bleached in the washing engine directly the grass\r\nhas been sufficiently cleaned. In this case the flow of fresh water\r\nis stopped and as much water as possible removed by means of the\r\ndrum-washer. The drum-washer is then raised out of the pulp and a\r\nknown volume of bleaching powder solution corresponding to a definite\r\nweight of dry powder is added to the contents of the breaking engine.\r\nThe amount used depends on the quantity of dry grass in the breaking\r\nengine, the usual proportion being 8 to 10 per cent. on the calculated\r\nair-dry weight of raw grass. As the stuff circulates round the engine\r\nthe colour gradually changes from dark yellow to white.\r\n\r\nThe process is sometimes hastened by blowing a small quantity of steam\r\ninto the mixture and thereby raising its temperature. Considerable care\r\nmust be exercised in using heat, because pulp bleached quickly by this\r\nmeans is liable to lose colour at the later stages of manufacture.\r\n\r\nWhen the pulp has been bleached to the required extent, the drum-washer\r\nis again lowered into contact with the bleached pulp, and the latter\r\nis thoroughly washed so as to be quite free from traces of bleach and\r\nother soluble impurities.\r\n\r\n(B) Esparto is often bleached in a \"Tower\" bleaching engine which\r\nconsists of a tall cylindrical vessel of 9 feet diameter, and 15 or 16\r\nfeet deep, at the bottom of which is fixed a small centrifugal pump.\r\n\r\nThe boiled grass together with sufficient water and clear bleaching\r\npowder solution is placed in the engine; the centrifugal pump draws\r\nthe mixture from the bottom of the vessel and discharges it, by means\r\nof a large external pipe, direct into the top of the vessel, where, as\r\nit falls, it comes into contact with a circular baffle-plate, which\r\ndistributes the pulp evenly over the surface of the mixture in the\r\nvessel. A continuous and rapid circulation is thus maintained, and the\r\nprocess is said to be very effective. The bleached pulp is subsequently\r\nwashed free from any traces of bleach.\r\n\r\n(C) Esparto is frequently bleached by the \"steeping\" process. In this\r\ncase the pulp is washed in the breaking engine, mixed with the required\r\nquantity of bleach, and at once discharged through the outlet pipes\r\nof the engine into large brick tanks, where the bleach is allowed to\r\nact quietly upon the boiled grass. This method produces a pulp of good\r\ncolour and is economical.\r\n\r\nWhichever process of bleaching is adopted, it is necessary to remove\r\nall the by-products formed during the process, as these soluble\r\nby-products if left in the mixture produce a lowering of colour.\r\n\r\nThe presence of small traces of bleaching powder solution can be\r\ndetected by the use of starch and potassium iodide test papers. If a\r\nhandful of the pulp after bleaching, when squeezed out, does not turn\r\nthe test paper violet or blue, then the absence of any free bleach is\r\ntaken for granted. The slightest trace of bleach will turn such test\r\npapers blue or violet according to the amount present. This is the test\r\nusually applied by the men in charge of the bleaching operations.\r\n\r\n_Making Sheets of Esparto Pulp._--For convenience in handling, it is\r\nusual to work up the washed and bleached pulp into the form of moist\r\nsheets. This is effected on a machine known as a \"presse-pâte,\" an\r\napparatus which closely resembles the wet end of a paper machine. It\r\nconsists of a set of flat strainers or screens, a horizontal wire\r\nsimilar to the paper machine wire, provided with deckles, the usual\r\ncouch rolls, and press rolls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--A Presse-pâte for Esparto Pulp.]\r\n\r\nThe pulp diluted with water is passed through the screens and on to\r\nthe horizontal wire, where it is formed into a moist sheet, the water\r\ndraining away from the wire, and also being removed by vacuum pumps.\r\nThe thick sheet of pulp is carried through the couch rolls and press\r\nrolls, being finally wound up on a wooden roller at the end of the\r\nmachine. In this moist condition it is ready for use in the mill.\r\n\r\n_Dry Esparto Pulp._--When the bleached pulp is intended for export\r\na more elaborate machine is used--to all intents and purposes a\r\npaper-making machine--by means of which the continuous sheet of moist\r\npulp is dried and cut up into smaller sheets of suitable size. These\r\ndried sheets are packed up in bales containing 2 cwt. or 4 cwt. of\r\ndried pulp, then wrapped in hessian and bound with iron wires.\r\n\r\n_Other Methods._--Since the yield of esparto pulp from the raw material\r\nis less than 50 per cent. and it requires 45 cwt. of grass to make\r\none ton of finished pulp, methods have been devised for treating the\r\ngrass in the green state in the districts where it is grown, but so far\r\nnothing has been done on a large scale.\r\n\r\n_The isolation of the cellulose by alkaline treatment in the cold_ has\r\nbeen suggested, but the method never passed beyond the experimental\r\nstage. This process was indeed first mentioned by Trabut, who many\r\nyears ago considered that the removal of non-fibrous constituents from\r\nfresh grass could be readily accomplished by the less drastic treatment\r\nof the esparto with alkaline carbonates of soda and potash at ordinary\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\n_The production of esparto pulp by bacteriological fermentation_ is an\r\nidea of later date. According to the inventor, the grass is crushed\r\nmechanically by means of rollers and then immersed in sea water\r\ninoculated with special bacillus obtained from esparto, and gradually\r\nresolved into cellulose and soluble by-products by fermentation which\r\nis complete in about eleven days. The commercial value of this idea has\r\nnot yet been demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nESPARTO PULP: MICROSCOPICAL FEATURES.\r\n\r\nThe pulp of esparto when examined under the microscope is easily\r\nrecognised, first by the characteristic appearance of the long slender\r\ncylindrical-shaped fibres, and secondly by the numerous cells always\r\npresent. These cells consist of cuticular vessels with serrated edges,\r\nand also of small pear-shaped seed hairs, the shape of which is a ready\r\nmeans of identifying esparto. An examination of the transverse section\r\nof the raw material indicates the source of these pear-shaped vessels.\r\n\r\n_Test for Esparto in Papers._--Paper containing esparto fibre may be\r\ntested by means of a weak solution of aniline sulphate. The suspected\r\npaper is gently heated in the test reagent, and if esparto is present\r\nthe paper turns a rose-red or pink colour, the depth of colour being\r\na measure of the amount of esparto. Most of the modern book papers\r\nare prepared from chemical wood pulp and esparto mixed in varying\r\nproportions, and while this test can be used as a means of detecting a\r\nsmall or a large proportion of esparto, a microscopical examination is\r\nrequired for a more accurate estimation.\r\n\r\nThe proportions used by the paper-maker depend upon the weighing\r\nout of the wood pulp and esparto more or less accurately, while\r\nthe microscopical test is based upon the relative proportions as\r\nrepresented by the volume of fibres of each class on the glass slip\r\nplaced under the microscope. Since the wood pulp consists of a number\r\nof broad flat ribbon-like fibres, and the esparto of small cylindrical\r\nfibres, considerable practice is necessary in making a proper analysis\r\nof the two constituents in paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Esparto Pulp.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAW.\r\n\r\nThe use of straw for the manufacture of paper was first brought\r\nprominently into notice about the year 1800 by Matthias Koops, who\r\npublished a book printed on paper made from straw, but it was not until\r\n1860 that this material was used in any large quantity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--A Cylindrical Digester for Boiling Fibre.]\r\n\r\nStraw is now converted into a bleached paper pulp for news and\r\nprintings, and is also utilised for the manufacture of straw boards.\r\n\r\nThe production of a white paper pulp from straw is carried out in a\r\nmanner similar to that used in the case of esparto fibre, viz., by\r\ndigestion with caustic soda under pressure and subsequent bleaching.\r\nAs the straw contains considerable quantities of siliceous matter, the\r\nchemical treatment necessary to reduce the material to paper pulp is\r\nmore severe, a stronger solution of caustic soda being used, and the\r\nprocess of digestion being carried out at a higher temperature.\r\n\r\nFor the best quality of straw cellulose, the material is cut up into\r\nsmall pieces by machines which resemble an ordinary chaff-cutter, and\r\nthe knots taken out by a separating machine. In most cases, however,\r\nthe whole straw is simply cut up into small lengths of about one to\r\ntwo inches long, and placed at once in the digester. When the straw is\r\ncontaminated with foreign weeds, sand, husks, and similar substances,\r\nas is usually the case, it is carefully hand-picked by girls, who\r\nremove these impurities, which tend to produce particles of unbleached\r\nmatter in the finished pulp. The expense of this preliminary cleaning\r\nprocess is more than compensated for by the enhanced value of the\r\nbleached straw pulp.\r\n\r\n_Digesting._--The cut straw is boiled in rotary cylindrical or\r\nspherical vessels, stationary upright boilers of the vomiting type\r\nbeing seldom employed because the circulation of the caustic soda\r\nliquor does not take place freely with straw packed in the latter.\r\n\r\nAs the material is very bulky, some of the liquor is first put into the\r\nboiler and the steam admitted while the straw is being thrown in. By\r\nthis means the straw is softened and reduced in bulk, so that a larger\r\nquantity can be added before the digester is quite full. The full\r\namount of caustic soda is then made up by further additions of liquor,\r\nand the contents of the digester heated by high-pressure steam for four\r\nto six hours.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of treatment are shown by the following trial:--\r\n\r\n      Amount of straw                   5,600 lbs.\r\n      Caustic soda, 20 per cent.        1,120 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe caustic soda was added in the form of a liquor, having a volume of\r\n2,012 gallons and a specific gravity of 1·055.\r\n\r\n      Time of boiling                 5 hours.\r\n      Pressure                        60 lbs.\r\n\r\n_Washing._--The boiled straw is discharged into large tanks placed\r\nbelow the digester and washed with hot water, the smallest possible\r\nquantity being used consistent with complete washing in order to\r\nprevent the accumulation of large volumes of weak lye. The spent liquor\r\nand washing waters are drained off into store tanks and evaporated in a\r\nmultiple effect apparatus by the same process as that used for esparto\r\npulp. The last washings are usually run away because the percentage of\r\nsoda in them is too small to pay for the cost of recovery.\r\n\r\nThe final washing of the straw pulp is completed by the use of a\r\nbreaking engine or potcher. As straw pulp contains a large proportion\r\nof cellular matter which cannot be regarded as true fibres, there\r\nis always a danger of considerable loss in yield if the use of the\r\nbreaking engine is extensively adopted, because the short cells escape\r\nthrough the meshes of the drum-washer. The washing is most economically\r\neffected in the tanks if a good yield of pulp is required.\r\n\r\n_Separating out Knots._--The broken pulp from the breaking engines is\r\ndiluted with large quantities of water and pumped over sand traps in\r\norder to remove knots and weeds which have resisted the action of the\r\ncaustic soda. These traps consist of long shallow trays, perhaps sixty\r\nto eighty yards long, one yard wide, and nine inches deep, containing\r\nboards which stretch from side to side, sloping at an angle, and nailed\r\nto the bottom of the trays. The dilute pulp flows through the trays,\r\nleaving the heavy particles, knots, and foreign matter behind the\r\nsloping boards, and finally passes over the strainers, which retain\r\nany large coarse pieces still remaining.\r\n\r\n_Making Sheets of Pulp._--The mixture from the strainers contains a\r\nlarge excess of water which has to be removed before the pulp can be\r\nbleached. For this purpose a wet press machine (see page 103) or a\r\npresse-pâte (see page 85) is employed, and the wet sheets of pulp are\r\nthen ready for bleaching.\r\n\r\n_Bleaching._--The process by which the pulp is bleached is exactly\r\nsimilar to that used for treating esparto.\r\n\r\nFrom 1870 to 1890 large quantities of straw were used for the\r\nmanufacture of newspaper in conjunction with esparto and wood pulp, but\r\nthe price of the material was gradually advanced so that it could not\r\nbe used with advantage, especially as the production of wood pulp gave\r\na material which was much cheaper, and which could be utilised at once\r\nwithout chemical treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of newspaper the tendency during recent years has\r\nbeen to make the paper mill operations as mechanical as possible and to\r\ndispense with the preliminary operations which are essential for the\r\nmanufacture of half-stuff, the chemical processes being left in the\r\nhands of the pulp manufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of straw cellulose is now practically confined to\r\nGermany, but small quantities of the bleached straw cellulose are\r\nimported because the pulp imparts certain qualities to paper which\r\nimprove it, notably in making cheap printing papers harder and more\r\nopaque.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICROSCOPICAL FEATURES OF STRAW.\r\n\r\nThe paper pulp obtained from straw consists of a mixture of short\r\nfibres together with a large proportion of oval-shaped cells. The\r\nfibres are short and somewhat resemble esparto, but the presence of\r\nthe smaller cells is a sure indication of the straw pulp. The fibres\r\nthemselves closely resemble the fibres of esparto, but as a rule the\r\nlatter are long slender fibres, while the straw fibre is very often\r\nbent and twisted or slightly kinked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Straw.]\r\n\r\nThe only method of distinguishing between straw and esparto is by\r\nexamination with the microscope. There is no chemical reagent known\r\nwhich will produce a colour reaction on a paper containing straw that\r\nwill serve to distinguish it from a paper containing esparto. If such\r\npapers are gently heated in a weak solution of aniline sulphate a pink\r\ncolour is slowly developed, the intensity of which is to some extent a\r\nmeasure of the amount of straw or esparto present.\r\n\r\nStraw and esparto are usually described in text-books under one\r\nheading, partly because the fibres possess strong resemblances in\r\nphysical and chemical constitution, and partly because the methods of\r\nmanufacture are identical. At the same time the qualities of the two\r\npulps are so different that they cannot be used indiscriminately, the\r\none for the other. Straw cellulose cannot be utilised in the place\r\nof esparto, particularly for light bulky papers. Hence in magazine\r\nand book papers containing a fibre which gives a pink coloration with\r\naniline sulphate it is fairly safe to assume that esparto pulp is\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWOOD PULP AND WOOD PULP PAPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF MECHANICAL WOOD PULP.\r\n\r\nWood is converted into pulp suitable for the manufacture of paper by\r\nmethods which produce two distinct varieties. The first is _mechanical\r\nwood pulp_, so called because it is made by a purely mechanical\r\nprocess. The second is termed _chemical wood pulp_ from the fact that\r\nthe material is submitted to chemical treatment.\r\n\r\n_Ground Wood and Cellulose._--The two varieties of pulp are sometimes\r\ndistinguished by the use of the terms ground wood and cellulose. In\r\nthe former case the description implies a product consisting of pulp\r\nobtained by grinding wood into a fibrous condition, while in the second\r\nthe word suggests a purified chemical product freed from the resinous\r\nand non-fibrous constituents found in wood. This is, in fact, the\r\nessential difference, for mechanical wood pulp consists of fibres which\r\nhave been torn away from wood by means of a grindstone; it differs\r\nbut slightly in chemical composition from the original raw material\r\nand contains most of the complex substances natural to wood. Chemical\r\nwood pulp, on the other hand, consists of fibre isolated from wood in\r\nsuch a manner that the complex non-fibrous substances are more or less\r\nentirely removed. The difference between these two pulps is shown in\r\nthe following approximate analysis of spruce wood, and of the pulp\r\nderived from it. The composition of the mechanical pulp is practically\r\nidentical with that of the wood itself.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF SPRUCE WOOD, AND OF CHEMICAL WOOD PULP (SPRUCE).\r\n\r\n      ----------------+---------+----------\r\n             --       |  Wood   | Chemical\r\n                      |(Spruce).|Wood Pulp.\r\n      ----------------+---------+----------\r\n      Cellulose       |  53·0   |  88·0\r\n      Resin           |   1·5   |   0·5\r\n      Aqueous Extract |   2·5   |   0·5\r\n      Water           |  12·0   |   8·0\r\n      Lignin          |  30·5   |   2·5\r\n      Ash             |   0·5   |   0·5\r\n                      +---------+----------\r\n                      | 100·0   | 100·0\r\n      ----------------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nThe use of mechanical wood pulp is generally confined to the\r\nmanufacture of news, common printings and packing papers, cardboards,\r\nand boxboards. It possesses very little strength, quickly discolours\r\nwhen exposed to light and air, and gradually loses its fibrous\r\ncharacter. The chemical wood pulp is a strong fibre, from which\r\nhigh-class papers can be manufactured, the colour and strength of which\r\nleave little to be desired.\r\n\r\n_Species of Wood._--The woods most commonly used for the manufacture\r\nof wood pulp belong to the order Coniferæ, or cone-bearing trees.\r\nIn Europe the spruce and silver fir are the chief species, while in\r\nAmerica spruce, balsam, pine, and fir are employed. The harder woods,\r\nsuch as hemlock, beech, larch and others, are not converted into pulp\r\nby the mechanical process.\r\n\r\n_Timber Operations._--The trees are cut down in the early part of\r\nwinter by gangs of men specially trained to the work. The organisation\r\nof a lumber camp when the operations are of an extensive character is\r\nvery complete and carefully arranged, every detail being attended to\r\nin order to get out the wood as cheaply and expeditiously as possible.\r\nThe branches and small tops are removed from the trees when they are\r\nfallen, and the trunks cut into logs of 12, 14, or 16 feet in length,\r\nand afterwards piled up on the banks of the nearest river, or on the\r\nice, ready for the breaking up of the winter.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ice breaks up and the rivers become navigable the logs\r\nare floated down to their destination, in some cases hundreds of miles\r\nfrom the scene of operations. Where rivers are not available the timber\r\nis brought out by horses or bullocks, or by means of a light railway.\r\n\r\n_Log Cutting._--As the timber arrives at the mill it is carefully\r\nmeasured, both as to its diameter and length, in order that a record\r\nmay be kept of the quantity used. Some of the logs are piled up in\r\nthe storeyard for use in the winter, and the remainder converted into\r\npulp day by day. The logs are first cut into short pieces about 2 feet\r\nlong by means of a powerful circular saw, the arrangements for this\r\nwork being devised so as to keep down the cost of labour as much as\r\npossible. All waste pieces are thrown aside to be utilised as fuel.\r\n\r\n_Barking._--The bark on the logs is removed in one or two ways. Much\r\nof it is knocked off during the transfer from the forest to the mill,\r\nbut even then the wood requires to be cleaned. In Norway and Sweden\r\nthe wood is treated in a _tumbler_ or a _barker_, while in America and\r\nCanada the use of the tumbler is practically unknown.\r\n\r\nThe barker consists of a heavy iron disc fitted with knives, usually\r\nthree in number, which project from the surface of the disc about\r\nhalf or three-quarters of an inch. The barker rotates in a vertical\r\nposition, and the short pieces of wood are brought one by one into\r\ncontact with the disc in such a manner that the bark is shaved off by\r\nthe knives. The machine is provided with conveniences for pressing the\r\nwood against the disc and for turning the logs as they are barked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--A Pair of Barkers for removing Bark from Logs\r\nof Wood.]\r\n\r\nThe machine is encased in a strong cast-iron cover, and all the bark\r\nshaved off is carried away by the strong current of air set up by the\r\nrapid motion of the disc, and subsequently burnt.\r\n\r\nThe tumbler system is quite different. In this case the short pieces\r\nare thrown into a large circular drum with hot water, and the bark\r\ntaken off by the friction of the pieces as the drum rotates. The loss\r\nof material is of course less in this process, but the wood is not\r\ncleaned quite so effectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--View of Horizontal Grinder (A), with Section\r\n(B).]\r\n\r\nThe wood at this stage can be used either for the manufacture of\r\nmechanical or chemical pulp. As a general rule the pieces are taken\r\nindiscriminately for either process, but sometimes the wood is sorted\r\nout, the clean stuff free from knots and blemishes being reserved for\r\nhigh quality chemical pulp.\r\n\r\n_Grinding._--The main feature of the grinding process is the attrition\r\nof the wood when held against the surface of a rapidly revolving\r\ngrindstone, the fibres as they are rubbed off being instantly carried\r\naway from the stone by a current of water. A complete description of\r\nthe machines used and the modifications of the process practised by\r\nmanufacturers is impossible in this book, but the following points will\r\nbe sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe machine consists of a large grindstone about 54 inches in diameter,\r\nand 27 inches thick. It rotates in a vertical or in a horizontal\r\nposition at a high speed. The stone revolves inside a casing which is\r\nprovided with a number of _pockets_, so called, into which the pieces\r\nof wood are thrown at regular intervals, as fast as the wood is ground\r\nby the friction of the stone.\r\n\r\nA continual stream of water playing upon the surface of the stone\r\nwashes away the pulp into a tank or pit below the machine.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the pulp may be varied by the conditions under which it\r\nis made. By limiting the proportion of water so that the wood remains\r\nin contact with the stone for a longer time the temperature of the mass\r\nin the pockets rises. Such _hot ground pulp_, as it is termed, is tough\r\nand strong.\r\n\r\nWhen the fibres are washed away from the stone as fast as they are\r\nproduced the temperature does not rise, and _cold ground_ pulp is made,\r\nwhich is not characterised by the somewhat leathery feel of the pulp\r\nmade at the higher temperature.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the stone plays an important part also. If the stone\r\nis smooth the wood is rubbed away slowly, but if the surface has been\r\nroughened and grooved by means of a special tool the fibres are torn\r\naway quickly. In the first case the pulp comes from the stone in a\r\nfinely-ground state and in a uniform condition, while in the second\r\nthe pulp is coarse and chippy.\r\n\r\nThe output of the machine is, however, much increased by the use of\r\nsharp stones and by the application of considerable pressure to the\r\nblocks of wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--A Vertical Grinder for making Hot Ground\r\nMechanical Wood Pulp.]\r\n\r\n_Screening._--The mixture of water and pulp leaving the grinder falls\r\ninto a tank below the stone, all large chips being retained by means\r\nof a perforated plate. The finer pulp, still too coarse for use, is\r\nthen pumped to the screens, which serve to remove all chippy and coarse\r\nfibres and produce a uniform material. The _shaking sieve_ consists\r\nof a shallow tray, the bottom of which is a brass plate or series of\r\nplates perforated with small holes or slits. The pulp flows on to the\r\ntray, which is kept in a state of violent agitation, the fine pulp\r\npassing through the holes and the coarser pieces working down to the\r\nlower edge of the tray into a trough which carries them away. The _flat\r\nscreen_ is somewhat different in construction, but the principle of\r\nseparation is the same. It consists of brass perforated plates forming\r\nthe bottom of a shallow cast-iron tray, continually agitated by means\r\nof cams fixed to the under surface of the trays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Centrifugal Screen for Wood Pulp.]\r\n\r\nThe _centrifugal screen_ is a cage made of finely perforated brass\r\nsheeting which revolves at a very high rate of speed inside a circular\r\ncast-iron vessel. The pulp flows into the interior of the cage, the\r\nfine fibres being forced through the screen by the centrifugal action\r\nof the machine, and the coarse material is retained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Section of Centrifugal Screen for Wood Pulp.]\r\n\r\n_Wet Pressing._--The pulp leaving the screens is mixed with such a\r\nlarge quantity of water that it is necessary to concentrate it. This\r\nis effected by means of the wet press machine (Fig. 41). The pulp and\r\nwater are pumped into a wooden box in which revolves a large hollow\r\ndrum, the surface of this drum consisting of a fine wire cloth of about\r\n60 or 70 mesh. The drum is not entirely immersed in the mixture, so\r\nthat as it rotates the pulp forms a skin or thin sheet on the surface,\r\nand the water passes away through the wire into the interior of the\r\nhollow drum. The drum carries the thin sheet out of the box and above\r\nthe level of the mixture until it comes into contact with an endless\r\nblanket or felt, which is pressed against that part of the drum not\r\nimmersed in the liquid.\r\n\r\nBy this means the thin sheet is transferred to the felt and carried\r\nbetween squeezing rolls to the finishing rolls. The felt, carrying on\r\nits upper surface the thin sheet of pulp, passes between two rolls,\r\nusually 16 to 20 inches in diameter, the upper being made of wood and\r\nthe lower one of cast iron. The pulp adheres to the upper drum and the\r\nfelt passes round the lower drum back to the box containing the mixture\r\nof pulp and water; the thin sheet is continuously wound on the upper\r\nroll until a certain thickness is reached.\r\n\r\nWhen this occurs the attendant removes the thick sheet by a dexterous\r\nmovement of a sharp stick across the face of the roll. The wet pulp at\r\nthis stage consists of 30 per cent. air-dry pulp and 70 per cent. of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Hydraulic Pressing._--The sheets taken from the wet press machine are\r\nfolded into a convenient shape and piled up, coarse pieces of sacking\r\nbeing placed between the sheets. At stated intervals the piles are\r\nsubmitted to pressure in hydraulic presses in order to remove further\r\nquantities of water, which slowly drains away through the sacking. In\r\nthis way a mass of pulp in the form of thick folded sheets containing\r\n50 per cent. of dry wood pulp is produced.\r\n\r\nThe pieces of sacking are taken out and the sheets put up in bales of\r\nany required weight, usually 2 cwt. or 4 cwt.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF CHEMICAL WOOD PULP.\r\n\r\nMost vegetable fibres are converted into pulp by alkaline processes,\r\nthat is by digesting the raw material with caustic soda and similar\r\nalkaline substances. Wood may be treated in two ways, one of which is\r\nthe ordinary soda process, and the other an acid treatment requiring\r\nthe use of sulphurous acid.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the Wood._--The logs of wood are cut up and barked\r\nexactly as in the case of mechanical pulp. The short two-foot pieces\r\nare then cut up into small flakes about one inch square and half an\r\ninch thick by means of a machine known as a _chipper_. This is similar\r\nin construction to a barker, consisting of a heavy iron disc rotating\r\nat a high speed inside a stout cover. The disc revolves in a vertical\r\nposition, and three projecting knives slice up the logs into flakes.\r\nFor this purpose the disc is provided with three slots which radiate\r\nfrom the centre towards the circumference for about 12 inches. The\r\nknives can be adjusted so that they stand up through the slots and\r\nabove the surface of the disc to any required distance.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure uniformity in the size of the chips, the practice\r\nis frequently adopted of sifting the wood leaving the chipper. The\r\nsieve is a large skeleton drum, the outer surface of which is made of a\r\ncoarse wire cloth capable of passing all pieces of the size mentioned.\r\nLarger chips and pieces are retained in the drum as it revolves in a\r\nhorizontal position and only fall out on reaching the extreme end of\r\nthe machine.\r\n\r\n_The Digesters._--The object of boiling the wood under pressure with\r\nchemicals is to dissociate the valuable fibrous portion of the plant\r\nfrom the resinous and non-fibrous portion. In this process the wood\r\nloses half its weight, the yield of pulp being about 50 per cent., and\r\nthe remainder is dissolved out by the chemical solution. The conditions\r\nof treatment are extremely varied in character, the quality of the pulp\r\nproduced varying in proportion.\r\n\r\nThe digesters are either spherical, cylindrical, or egg-shaped, being\r\nconstructed to revolve at a slow rate of speed, or fixed permanently\r\nin an upright position. Spherical boilers are usually 9 or 10 feet in\r\ndiameter, the cylindrical digesters being 40 or 50 feet high and 12 or\r\n15 feet diameter, the larger ones being capable of taking 20 tons of\r\nwood for each operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Wood Pulp Digester, partly in elevation,\r\npartly in section.]\r\n\r\nFor the alkaline process the interior of the digester does not require\r\nany special treatment, but with the acid process the internal portion\r\nof the boiler is carefully lined with a thick layer of acid-resisting\r\nbrick and cement.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the digester are heated by means of high-pressure\r\nsteam, which is blown direct into the mass or passed through a coil\r\nlying at the bottom of the vessel. In the former case the steam is\r\ncondensed by the liquor, the volume of which is consequently increased,\r\nwhile in the latter case the condensed steam is drawn off continuously\r\nfrom the pipes. Each system has its own particular advantages.\r\n\r\n_Different Kinds of Chemical Wood Pulp._--According to the method of\r\ntreatment so the quality of the pulp varies. The chemicals used, the\r\nsystem of boiling, the temperature of digestion, the strength of the\r\nsolutions, the duration of the cooking period, and, last but not least,\r\nthe species of wood, are all determining factors in the value of the\r\nultimate product.\r\n\r\n_Soda Pulp._--This is prepared by digesting wood with caustic soda in\r\nrevolving boilers for eight or ten hours at a pressure of 60 to 80 lbs.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate Pulp._--Prepared by digesting the wood with a mixture of\r\ncaustic soda, sulphide of soda, and sulphate of soda.\r\n\r\n_Sulphite Pulp._--The process most generally adopted for the\r\nmanufacture of wood pulp is the treatment of the material in\r\nbrick-lined digesters with bisulphite of lime for eight to nine hours\r\nat a pressure of 80 lbs.\r\n\r\n_Mitscherlich Pulp._--This is sulphite pulp prepared by digesting the\r\nwood at a much lower temperature and for a longer period than the\r\nordinary sulphite. The steam is not blown direct into the mass of wood,\r\nand the pressure seldom exceeds 45 or 50 lbs., the time of boiling\r\noccupying 45 to 50 hours. So called from the name of the inventor.\r\n\r\n_Sulphite Wood Pulp._--This name is given to pulp prepared by digesting\r\nwood with solutions containing sulphurous acid, or salts of sulphurous\r\nacid. The acid is produced by burning sulphur or certain ores\r\ncontaining sulphur, such as copper or iron pyrites, in special ovens.\r\nThe most modern form of oven consists of a cylindrical cast-iron drum\r\nrevolving slowly in a horizontal position on suitable bearings. The\r\nsulphur is thrown at intervals, or fed automatically, into the oven,\r\nthe amount of air being carefully regulated to avoid the formation of\r\nsulphuric acid in the later stages of preparation. The sulphur is also\r\nburnt in stationary ovens which consist of flat shallow closed trays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--View of ordinary Sulphur-burning Ovens.]\r\n\r\nThe hot sulphurous acid gas passes through pipes and is cooled, after\r\nwhich it is brought into contact with water and lime for the production\r\nof the bisulphite of lime. This is accomplished by one of two methods\r\nas follows.\r\n\r\n_Tower System._--The cool gas is drawn into high towers usually\r\nbuilt of wood, 7 or 8 feet diameter, which are filled with masses of\r\nlimestone. From tanks at the top of each tower a carefully regulated\r\nquantity of water flows down upon the limestone and absorbs the\r\nascending column of gas, this being drawn into the tower from the\r\nbottom. The limestone is simultaneously dissolved, and the liquid\r\nwhich flows out from the pipes at the bottom of the tower consists of\r\nlime dissolved in sulphurous acid, together with a certain proportion\r\nof free sulphurous acid. This is generally known as a solution of\r\nbisulphite of lime.\r\n\r\n_Tank System._--The somewhat costly tower system has in many cases been\r\nsuperseded by the use of a number of huge wooden vats, 10 to 12 feet\r\ndiameter and 8 to 10 feet high. These tanks are filled with water and\r\na known quantity of slaked lime. The gas is forced into the tanks by\r\npressure or drawn through by suction, and the conversion of the milk of\r\nlime into bisulphite of lime proceeds automatically. In order to ensure\r\ncomplete absorption the gas passes through the tanks in series, so that\r\nthe spent gases leaving the vats do not contain any appreciable amount\r\nof sulphurous acid.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain pulp of uniform quality it is necessary that the\r\nliquor should be of constant composition. The formula differs in the\r\nvarious mills according to the conditions which are found most suitable.\r\n\r\n_Sulphite Digesters._--The almost universal form of boiler employed in\r\ncooking wood by the sulphite process is a tall cylindrical vessel of\r\nabout 50 feet in height, and 14 to 15 feet internal diameter, lined\r\nwith acid-resisting brick.\r\n\r\nThis form of digester is capable of holding 20 tons of wood at one\r\ncharge, yielding 10 tons of finished pulp.\r\n\r\nThe chipped wood is discharged into the digesters from huge bins\r\nerected just above the openings to the digesters, so that the latter\r\ncan be filled without any delay and the requisite quantity of sulphite\r\nliquor added.\r\n\r\nThe manhole or cover is at once put on, securely fastened, and steam\r\nturned on gradually until the pressure reaches 70 or 80 lbs., at which\r\npressure the cooking is steadily maintained. The progress of the\r\noperation is watched and samples of the liquor drawn from the boiler\r\nat intervals to be tested, so that the boiling may be stopped when the\r\nresults of the testing show the wood is sufficiently cooked.\r\n\r\nThere is no special difficulty in this operation, provided the\r\nnecessary conditions are observed. It is important that the wood should\r\nbe dry, and that the proportion of sulphite liquor per ton of dry wood\r\nshould be constant. If the wood happens to be wet, due allowance must\r\nbe made for the excess water and a somewhat stronger liquor used in\r\norder to compensate for this. Other precautions of a similar character\r\nare observed in order to minimise the danger of an insufficiently\r\ncooked pulp.\r\n\r\n_Washing._--When the pulp has been boiled, a process which generally\r\noccupies seven or eight hours, the steam is shut off and the contents\r\nof the boiler blown out into large vats known as blow-out tanks, the\r\npressure of steam remaining in the digester being sufficient to empty\r\nthe softened pulp in a few minutes. Much of the spent sulphite liquor,\r\nnow containing the dissolved resinous and non-fibrous portions of the\r\noriginal wood, drains away from the mass in the tank, and then copious\r\nsupplies of clean water are added in order to wash out the residual\r\nliquors which it is essential to remove.\r\n\r\nNumerous other devices are employed to ensure the complete washing of\r\nthe boiled pulp.\r\n\r\n_Screening._--The production of a high-class pulp necessitates proper\r\nscreening to eliminate coarse pieces of unboiled wood and the knots,\r\nthe latter not being softened completely. The methods adopted vary\r\naccording to requirements.\r\n\r\nFor uniform clean pulp that can be bleached easily the material from\r\nthe blow-out tanks is, after washing, mixed with large quantities of\r\nwater and run through sand traps, which consist of long shallow wide\r\nboxes provided with slanting baffle-boards to retain knots and large\r\npieces of unsoftened wood, the pulp thus partially screened being\r\nsubsequently treated in the proper screening apparatus.\r\n\r\nSometimes the washed pulp is sent direct to the screens and the\r\nwell-boiled fibres sorted out by a system of graded screens, which\r\nseparate the completely isolated fibres from the bulk and retain the\r\nlarger pieces, these being broken down in a suitable engine and put\r\nback on the screens.\r\n\r\nThe machinery employed for screening chemical pulp is identical with\r\nthat used for the treatment of mechanical wood pulp.\r\n\r\n_Finishing._--The ordinary sulphite pulp is worked up into the form\r\nof dry sheets for the market and not sent out in a wet state as the\r\nmechanical wood. There are several practical disadvantages in preparing\r\nthe latter in a dry condition which do not, however, occur with\r\nchemical pulp.\r\n\r\nHence the pulp after being screened is not pressed but submitted to a\r\ndifferent process. From the screens the mixture of pulp and water, the\r\nlatter being present in large quantity, is pumped into a concentrator,\r\nor slusher, as it is termed, by means of which some of the water is\r\ntaken out.\r\n\r\nThe slusher consists of a wooden box divided into two compartments by\r\na vertical partition. In the larger compartment a hollow drum covered\r\nwith a fine wire cloth revolves, the construction and purpose of which\r\nare precisely the same as that of the wet press machine used for\r\nmechanical pulp.\r\n\r\nAs the drum revolves the pulp adheres to the outer surface, while\r\nthe water passes through the wire cloth. The drum is not completely\r\nimmersed in the mixture, so that the skin of pulp is brought out of the\r\nwater by the rotation of the drum. When this takes place the contact of\r\na wooden or felt covered roll which revolves on the top of the drum\r\ncauses the pulp to be transferred from the drum to the roll. The wet\r\npulp is continuously scraped off by an iron bar or _doctor_, as it is\r\ncalled, resting on the surface of the roll, and it finally drops into\r\nthe second compartment of the slusher in a more concentrated form ready\r\nfor the drying machine.\r\n\r\n_Drying._--The mass of wet pulp from the slusher is conveyed into a\r\ncircular reservoir or _stuff chest_, which serves to supply the machine\r\nused for converting the pulp into dry sheets.\r\n\r\nThe machine is to all intents and purposes a Fourdrinier paper machine,\r\nand the process is similar to that used for the manufacture of paper.\r\nThe pulp flows in a continuous stream on to a horizontal endless wire,\r\nwhich carries it forward as a thin layer; the water drains through\r\nthe meshes of the wire, further quantities being removed by _suction\r\nboxes_, which draw away the water by virtue of the vacuum produced by\r\nspecial pumps. The wet sheet then passes between the _couch rolls_\r\nwhich compress the pulp, squeezing out more water, and then through\r\n_press rolls_, which finally give a firm adherent sheet of pulp\r\ncontaining 70 per cent. of water. The sheet is dried by passing over\r\na number of steam heated cylinders, which cause all the moisture to\r\nevaporate from the pulp. At the end of the machine the dry pulp is cut\r\nup into sheets of any convenient size, and packed up in bales of two or\r\nfour cwts.\r\n\r\n_Mitscherlich Sulphite Pulp._--This term is applied to sulphite wood\r\nprepared by submitting the chipped wood to a comparatively low pressure\r\nfor a long period. The wood is placed in the stationary upright form of\r\ndigester with the requisite amount of liquor, and the heating produced\r\nby the passage of steam through a leaden coil lying at the bottom of\r\nthe digester, so that the steam does not condense in the liquor but\r\nin the coil, from which it is drawn off. The pressure seldom exceeds\r\n45 lbs. but the duration of the cooking is thirty-six to forty-eight\r\nhours. The boiler is not emptied under pressure, but the pulp is\r\ndischarged from the digester after the pressure has been lowered, and\r\nthe manhole taken off. The contents are usually shovelled out by the\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\nThe pulp is carefully washed, screened and made up into wet sheets\r\non the ordinary wet press machine. This pulp is never dried on the\r\nFourdrinier like the common sulphite, as its special qualities can only\r\nbe preserved by the treatment described. This pulp is particularly\r\nsuitable for parchment papers, grease proofs and transparent papers.\r\n\r\n_Soda Wood Pulp._--The chipped wood is boiled in stationary or\r\nrevolving digesters for eight or nine hours at a pressure of 70 or 80\r\nlbs. A solution of caustic soda is employed, about 16 to 20 per cent.\r\nof the weight of the wood being added to the contents of the digester.\r\nLive steam is blown direct into the mass, and after the operation the\r\nspent liquor is carefully kept for subsequent treatment. The pulp is\r\nwashed in such a manner that the amount of water actually used is kept\r\ndown to the smallest possible volume consistent with a complete removal\r\nof soluble matters. This is done in order that the spent liquors may be\r\ntreated for the recovery of the soda.\r\n\r\n_Recovery of Spent Liquors._--When wood is cooked by the soda and\r\nsulphate processes the solutions containing the dissolved organic\r\nmatter from the wood can be evaporated, and the original chemical\r\nrecovered. In the case of soda pulp the method of treatment is as\r\nfollows: the spent liquors and the washings are evaporated by means of\r\na multiple effect vacuum apparatus to a thick syrup. The concentrated\r\nliquor produced is then burnt in special furnaces, all the organic\r\nmatter being consumed, leaving a black mass which consists mainly\r\nof carbonate of soda. The mass is washed with water to remove the\r\ncarbonate which is afterwards converted into caustic soda by being\r\nboiled with lime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Spruce Wood Pulp.]\r\n\r\nThe spent liquors from the sulphite process have no value, for they\r\ncannot be recovered by this method. At present the whole of the sulphur\r\nused and the organic matter dissolved from the wood is lost. This means\r\nthe loss of about 250 to 350 lbs. of sulphur and nearly 50 per cent. of\r\nthe weight of wood for every ton of pulp produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD PULP; MICROSCOPIC FEATURES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Mechanical Wood Pulp.]\r\n\r\nMechanical and chemical pulps are readily distinguished under the\r\nmicroscope. The former consists of fibres of irregular shape and size,\r\nmixed with a large proportion of structureless particles, all bearing\r\nevidence of having been torn apart and separated by mechanical methods.\r\nThe chemical pulp, on the other hand, consists of fibres isolated by a\r\nprocess which preserves them in perfect condition and form. The pulp\r\nfrom the various woods can be differentiated by minute details in fibre\r\nstructure, some of the woods being determined from the presence of\r\ncharacteristic cells.\r\n\r\nThe use of aniline sulphate can also be resorted to, and for\r\nmicroscopic work the most useful reagent is a mixture of zinc chloride\r\nand iodine. This produces an intense yellow colour with mechanical pulp\r\nand a bluish colour with sulphite and other chemical wood pulps.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAILY NEWSPAPER.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers of the present day are made almost exclusively of wood\r\npulp. The use of the latter material for paper-making has steadily\r\nincreased from the date of its introduction about A.D. 1870, when wood\r\npulp was imported into England in considerable quantities.\r\n\r\nNews and cheap printings consist of mechanical and chemical wood pulps\r\nmixed in varying proportions determined chiefly by the price paid\r\nfor the finished paper. In some cases the proportion of mechanical\r\nwood pulp is as much as 85 per cent., though the average composition\r\nof a cheap wood paper is represented by the following proportions:\r\nMechanical pulp, 70 per cent.; sulphite pulp, 20 per cent.; loading, 10\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the enormous quantity of material used for the daily\r\npress may be judged from one or two examples. A certain popular weekly\r\nnewspaper having a circulation of one and a quarter million copies per\r\nweek requires every week 137 tons of paper produced from 170 tons of\r\nwood. A popular halfpenny newspaper boasting a circulation of about\r\none-half million copies per day consumes 185 tons of paper manufactured\r\nfrom 230 tons of wood, every week.\r\n\r\nIt is easy also from these facts to estimate the amount of timber\r\nwhich must be cut down to supply the demand for newspapers and cheap\r\nprintings.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of news calls for considerable skill and able\r\nmanagement, owing to the keen competition amongst the paper mills\r\ndevoted to this class of paper. The process as carried on in England is\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\nThe mechanical pulp, reaching the mill in the form of thick sheets\r\nsuitably packed up into bales, is first broken up again into moist\r\npulp. Various machines are used for this, such as Wurster's kneading\r\nengine, Cornett's breaker, or some similar contrivance. An old potcher,\r\nsuch as is used for the breaking and washing of rags, makes a good pulp\r\ndisintegrator. The broken pulp is discharged into beating engines in\r\nany suitable or convenient manner and the right proportion of chemical\r\nwood pulp added in the form of dry sheets. The beating process only\r\noccupies thirty to forty minutes in the case of the common news, a\r\nmarked contrast to the eight or nine hours required by rags. China clay\r\nis added to the contents of the beater, ten to twelve per cent. being\r\nthe general practice. This is followed by a measured quantity of rosin\r\nsize, and after thorough incorporation the size is precipitated upon\r\nthe fibres by means of alum.\r\n\r\nIn the commoner qualities of these papers the materials are added in\r\nthe dry state, but for finer grades of newspaper the china clay is\r\nmixed with water, and carefully drained through a fine sieve before\r\nuse. The alum cake is also dissolved and treated in a similar manner in\r\norder to keep out dirt and coarse particles likely to produce holes in\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\nThe paper machine used for the manufacture of cheap printings is\r\nconstructed to produce as much as 100 to 180 tons of finished paper per\r\nweek, every detail being arranged for a large output at a very high\r\nspeed. In the modern machine it is possible to produce paper at the\r\nrate of 450 to 550 feet per minute, the width of the sheet being from\r\n120 to 160 inches.\r\n\r\nCareful attention is paid to economy of every kind with regard to the\r\npower required for driving the machine, the amount of steam consumed\r\nin drying the paper, recovery of excess of fibre and china clay which\r\nescapes from the machine wire, and similar details of a mechanical\r\norder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--The Screens for removing Coarse Fibres from\r\nBeaten Pulp.]\r\n\r\nThe beaten pulp, after being sized and coloured, is discharged into\r\nhuge circular brick tanks, or stuff chests, two of which are found\r\nwith each paper machine. The supply of pulp and water for the machine\r\nis taken from one stuff chest while the second is being filled up\r\nfrom the beating engines, in order to secure a mixture of constant\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--The Paper Machine (wet end showing wire).]\r\n\r\nThe pulp is pumped from the stuff chest into a small regulating box\r\nplaced above the machine wire, and this box is kept full of beaten\r\npulp so that the supply of pulp and water to the machine is perfectly\r\nconstant. The pulp, diluted with the proper quantity of _back-water_,\r\nis carefully strained through rotary screens and allowed to flow\r\nthrough a distributing box on to the machine wire, where it rapidly\r\nforms a sheet of paper.\r\n\r\nThe excess of water, together with a certain proportion of fine\r\nfibre and china clay, falls through the wire, and is caught below\r\nin a shallow box, called the save-all. This _back-water_, as it is\r\ncalled, is used over again for diluting the beaten pulp to the right\r\nconsistency, as already described.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the water obtained in this way is not all utilised in the\r\nregulating box, and any surplus is pumped up continually into large\r\nstore tanks and used in the beating engines for breaking down the dry\r\npulp.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, where a large quantity of water is used on the machine,\r\nspecial methods have to be adopted for the recovery of all the fibre\r\nand clay, which would otherwise be lost, and there are many ingenious\r\nsystems in use whereby this saving is effected.\r\n\r\nThe most usual practice is to allow the excess of water, which contains\r\nfrom 8 to 15 lbs. of suspended matter per thousand gallons, to flow\r\nthrough a series of brick tanks at a slow rate of speed. The clay and\r\nfibre settle to the bottom of the tanks, and the water passes away from\r\nthe last tank almost clear and free from fibre and loading.\r\n\r\nThe drying of the moist paper leaving the press rolls of the machine is\r\neffected in the usual manner by means of drying cylinders. On account\r\nof the great increase of speed at which the paper is produced, the\r\nnumber of drying cylinders has also been increased, and at the present\r\ntime a machine of this description is provided with 28 or 32 cylinders,\r\nthe object being to dry the paper economically.\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL WOOD PULP IN PAPER.\r\n\r\nThe presence of mechanical wood pulp in paper is detected by means of\r\nseveral reagents, which produce a definite colour when applied to a\r\nsheet of paper containing mechanical wood. The depth of colour obtained\r\nindicates approximately the percentage present, but considerable\r\npractice and experience is necessary to interpret the colour exactly. A\r\nmore reliable method of estimating the percentage of mechanical wood in\r\na paper is by microscopic examination.\r\n\r\nThe reagents which can be used are--\r\n\r\n(1) _Nitric Acid._--This produces a brown stain on the paper, but it is\r\nnot a desirable reagent for ordinary office purposes.\r\n\r\n(2) _Aniline Sulphate._--A solution of this is prepared by dissolving 5\r\nparts of aniline sulphate in 100 parts of distilled water. When applied\r\nto the surface of news a yellow coloration is produced, more or less\r\nintense according to the amount of mechanical wood present. It can only\r\nbe used with white papers, or papers very slightly toned.\r\n\r\n(3) _Phloroglucine._--This sensitive reagent, which gives a rose-pink\r\ncolour when brushed on to the surface of the paper, is prepared by\r\ndissolving 4 grammes of phloroglucine in 100 c.c. of rectified spirits,\r\nand adding to the mixture 50 c.c. of pure concentrated hydrochloric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nThere are several other aniline compounds which give colour reactions\r\nof a similar character, but they are not often used. The phloroglucine\r\nreagent fails as a test for mechanical wood in papers which have\r\nbeen dyed with certain aniline colours, for example, metanil yellow.\r\nPaper which has been coloured with this dye will, when moistened with\r\nthe phloroglucine reagent, give an intense pink colour, even if no\r\nmechanical wood is present. This is due to the fact that the dye itself\r\nis acted upon by the hydrochloric acid in the test reagent. The same\r\ncolour is produced on the paper with hydrochloric acid _per se_.\r\n\r\nThere is little difficulty in distinguishing between the colour arising\r\nfrom the presence of such a dye, because the effect is instantaneous,\r\nwhereas the coloration due to mechanical wood develops gradually.\r\nMoreover, the reaction due to the presence of metanil yellow gives a\r\nperfectly even coloured surface, whereas with mechanical wood pulp the\r\nfibres appear to be more deeply stained than the body of the paper.\r\n\r\n_Output of a Paper Machine._--The quantity of paper which can be\r\nproduced on the paper machine is readily calculated from the following\r\ndata:--\r\n\r\n        Speed of machine in feet per minute   _F_\r\n        Nett deckle width in inches           _D_\r\n        Width of sheet of paper in inches     _W_\r\n        Length of sheet of paper in inches    _L_\r\n        Number of sheets in ream              _S_\r\n        Weight of paper per ream              _R_\r\n\r\nThe general formula for the output of paper per hour is\r\n\r\n                                720 × _F_ × _D_ × _R_\r\n      Output in lbs. per hour = -----------------------.\r\n                                   _S_ × _L_ × _W_\r\n\r\nWhen the number of sheets in the ream is 480, this formula simplifies to\r\n\r\n                                1½ × _R_ × _F_ × _D_\r\n      Output in lbs. per hour = --------------------.\r\n                                     _L_ × _W_\r\n\r\nThe term \"nett deckle width\" applies to the width of the trimmed\r\nfinished paper at the end of the machine. The formula takes no account\r\nof the allowance required for trimming edges. In most cases the deckle\r\nwidth of the machine is arranged so that the paper is cut into strips\r\nof equal width when leaving the calenders, _e.g._, a deckle of 80\r\ninches will give 4 sheets, each 20 inches wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Paper Machine showing Wire, Press Rolls, and\r\nDrying Cylinders.]\r\n\r\nThe method by which the general formula is obtained may be explained by\r\nan example.\r\n\r\nWhat is the output of a machine having a speed of 100 feet per minute,\r\nwith an 80-inch deckle, producing a sheet of paper 20 inches by 30\r\ninches, weighing 30 lbs. per ream of 480 sheets?\r\n\r\nThe machine produces every minute a sheet of paper 100 feet long and 80\r\ninches wide.\r\n\r\nHence output per minute in square inches\r\n\r\n              = 12 × 100 × 80.\r\n        Output per hour in square inches\r\n              = 60 × 12 × 100 × 80.\r\n\r\nNow each (20 × 30 × 480) square inches is area of one ream.\r\n\r\nOutput of paper per hour in reams\r\n\r\n                60 × 12 × 100 × 80\r\n              = ------------------.\r\n                   480 × 30 × 20\r\n\r\nOutput of paper per hour in lbs.\r\n\r\n                720 × 100 × 80 × 30\r\n              = -------------------\r\n                   480 × 30 × 20\r\n\r\n              = 600 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe general formula may be applied for the purpose of calculating the\r\nspeed at which the machine must be driven.\r\n\r\n_Example._--A machine with 75-inch deckle is required to produce\r\n6 cwts. per hour of a paper 25 inches by 18 inches (500 sheets),\r\nweighing 19 lbs. to the ream. At what speed is the machine to be driven?\r\n\r\nOutput in lbs. per hour\r\n\r\n                720 × _F_ × _D_ × _R_\r\n              = ---------------------\r\n                   _S_ × _L_ × _W_\r\n\r\n                720 × F × 75 × 19\r\n          672 = -----------------\r\n                  500 × 18 × 25\r\n\r\n          _F_ = 148 feet per minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBROWN PAPERS AND BOARDS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Common Browns._--The raw material used in the manufacture of common\r\nbrown papers is chiefly jute and waste fibres of every description,\r\nsuch as waste cuttings from boxboard factories, old papers, wood pulp\r\nrefuse, and other substances of a like nature. The jute, in the form\r\nof sacking or old gunny bags, and the hemp refuse, in the shape of old\r\nrope and string, are subjected to a slight chemical treatment just\r\nsufficient to isolate the fibres to a condition in which it is possible\r\nto work them up into paper. The bagging and string are cut up in a rag\r\nchopper and boiled in revolving boilers with lime or caustic soda for\r\nseveral hours at a pressure of 20-30 lbs., the lime being used when it\r\nis desired to manufacture a harsh paper, and the caustic soda being\r\nemployed for the production of paper having a softer feel. The pulp is\r\nnot always washed very completely after the process of digestion, as is\r\nthe case with white papers, and it is often possible to extract from\r\nbrown papers of this class a considerable proportion of the alkaline\r\nmatter which has not been thoroughly removed from the boiled pulp.\r\nThe presence of this alkaline residue does not affect the quality of\r\nordinary brown paper, but is frequently a serious defect in the case\r\nof middles or straw boards, which are afterwards utilised for boxes\r\nand covered with coloured papers. The colour of the paper pasted on to\r\nsuch incompletely washed boards is frequently spoilt by the action of\r\nthe alkali when moistened with the paste used, many aniline dyes being\r\nsusceptible to the small proportion of alkali present.\r\n\r\nThe stronger materials, such as jute or old rope and string, are either\r\nused by themselves or blended with inferior raw material according\r\nto the quality of the paper being made. The jute and hemp fibres are\r\ngenerally beaten by themselves in the engine before the other materials\r\nare added. The pulp is mixed with the required amount of loading, while\r\nthe sizing and colouring operations are carried out in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe common brown papers are known by a variety of trade names which\r\nat one time indicated the nature of the fibrous constituent, but at\r\nthe present day the name is no guide or indication of the material\r\nused for the manufacture of the paper. The common heavy brown used for\r\nwrapping sugar and sundry groceries made in heavy grey and blue shades\r\nis a coarse paper made from cheap materials and containing a large\r\nproportion of mineral matter. It is usually supplied under the trade\r\nname of _royal_.\r\n\r\nA somewhat lighter and stronger wrapping paper of a white or buff\r\ncolour, used for wrapping groceries, tea, and cotton goods, is that\r\nknown as _casings_, a name probably derived from the application of\r\nthis paper originally to the lining of cases.\r\n\r\n_Manila papers_ so called were originally made from rope, but the term\r\nis now applied to papers which may be made entirely of wood pulp.\r\n\r\n_Rope browns_ are common papers made of fairly strong material of a\r\nmiscellaneous character, this name having been derived from the fact\r\nthat rope and similar fibre were at one time used exclusively.\r\n\r\n_Wood Pulp Wrappers._--Most of the papers of the present day are made\r\nfrom wood pulp, this material giving a thin, light, tough paper, which\r\nis pleasant to handle and forms a great contrast to the dense, opaque,\r\nheavily loaded, and inartistic specimens produced some years ago. Paper\r\nof this kind, though apparently more expensive than common browns, is\r\nreally more economical in use. The paper is not only stronger, but it\r\nis possible to obtain a larger number of sheets for a given weight.\r\nThe great advantage in the improvement of brown papers dates from\r\nthe introduction of the now well-known kraft papers, which are of\r\ncomparatively recent origin.\r\n\r\n_Kraft Paper._--The term Kraft, meaning \"strength,\" is applied to\r\na remarkably strong cellulose paper prepared from spruce and other\r\nconiferous woods by the soda treatment, the special feature of the\r\nprocess being an incomplete digestion of the wood.\r\n\r\nThe wood previously chipped into pieces 1 inch to 1½ inches in length,\r\nis boiled with caustic soda, the digestion being stopped before the\r\nwood pulp has been quite softened, and while the pulp is still too\r\nhard to be broken up into isolated fibres by simple agitation in\r\nwater. The pulp after thorough washing is disintegrated by means of\r\nan edge-runner, or some form of breaking engine, the first mentioned\r\nprobably giving the most satisfactory results, and converted into paper\r\nby the usual methods.\r\n\r\nThe wood can also be reduced by the sulphate process, in which case the\r\nchipped wood is boiled in a liquor to which about 25 per cent. of spent\r\nlye from a previous cooking is added.\r\n\r\nThe best results are obtained by attention to the cooking process to\r\nensure an under-cooked pulp, by careful isolation of the fibres in a\r\nkollergang, or edge-runner, which machine is capable of separating the\r\nfibres without shortening them, and by proper manipulation on the paper\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThe paper produced under favourable conditions in this direction is\r\nwonderfully tough and strong and may be quoted as the most recent\r\nexample of the fact that the latent possibilities of wood pulp have by\r\nno means been exhausted or even thoroughly investigated.\r\n\r\n_Imitation Kraft Paper._--If wood is boiled in water at high\r\ntemperatures the fibre is softened and much of the resinous matter is\r\nremoved. Such wood, if ground in the same way and by the same methods\r\nas ordinary mechanical wood pulp, is readily disintegrated, and a\r\nlong-fibred pulp may be obtained. The process of boiling short 2 feet\r\nlogs of wood in a digester under a pressure of 20-50 lbs. has long\r\nbeen known. The wood after boiling is partly washed and then worked\r\nup into pulp by the usual mechanical process. The wood is easily\r\nground and yields pulp containing long fibres which in their physical\r\nproperties closely resemble those of pure wood cellulose, but the\r\noriginal constituents of the wood are present almost unchanged, just\r\nas in mechanical pulp. The product obtained by grinding is a very\r\ntough flexible material of a brownish yellow colour, and the paper is\r\nknown as _Nature brown_. It is chiefly used for the preparation of\r\ntough packing papers, for the covers of cheap pocket-books, and other\r\nmiscellaneous purposes. When this brown mechanical wood pulp paper is\r\nglazed on both sides it is then known as _ochre glazed_, the word ochre\r\nreferring to the colour. When made up into light weight papers it is\r\nsold as _imitation kraft paper_.\r\n\r\nA great variety of wrapping papers are now made from wood pulp, such\r\nas _sealings_, _sulphite browns_, _manilas_, _sulphite caps_, but the\r\ndistinctions between these papers relate chiefly to the amount of\r\nfinish, the colour and size of the sheet. The methods of manufacture\r\nonly differ in small details as indicated by these distinctions.\r\n\r\n_Fine Wrappings._--The papers used for packing small goods such as\r\nsilver ware and other delicate articles are generally tissues, the\r\nbetter qualities of which are made from rag, and the cheaper qualities\r\nfrom wood pulp. These papers are known as tissue, crêpe, crinkled\r\ntissue, manila tissue, and by a variety of trade terms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Single Cylinder or Yankee Machine.]\r\n\r\nMany of the fine wrappings of the tissue class and the somewhat heavier\r\npapers known as M. G. Caps are manufactured on the single cylinder\r\nmachine, which produces a paper having a highly polished surface on one\r\nside and a rough unglazed surface on the other side.\r\n\r\nIn the single cylinder machine the beaten pulp passes from the\r\nstuff-chest on to the wire of the ordinary Fourdrinier machine and\r\nthrough the press rolls, but instead of being dried over a number of\r\ncylinders the paper is led over one single cylinder of very large\r\ndiameter which is heated internally with steam. The paper is usually\r\npressed against the surface of the cylinder by means of a heavy felt,\r\nwhich is, however, sometimes omitted. The side of the paper coming\r\ninto contact with the cylinder becomes highly polished, the surface in\r\ncontact with the felt remaining in an unfinished rough condition. This\r\npaper is said to be machine glazed and is known as an M. G. paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Section of Wet Press, or Board Machine.]\r\n\r\n_Boards._--Cards, millboards, middles, boxboards, carriage panels,\r\nand similar paper products are manufactured either on a _single board\r\nmachine_, by means of which single sheets of any required thickness can\r\nbe obtained, or on a _continuous board machine_, which is capable of\r\nproducing cards and plain or duplex boards of moderate thickness.\r\n\r\nThe raw material used consists, as in the case of browns and wrappers,\r\nof every conceivable fibrous substance mixed with mineral matter and\r\nthen suitably coloured. The preliminary processes for the treatment of\r\nthe pulp are exactly the same as those employed in the case of brown\r\npapers up to the point at which the beating has been effected.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINGLE BOARD MACHINE.\r\n\r\nThe beaten pulp, diluted with large quantities of water, is pumped\r\ncontinuously into a large wooden vat of rectangular shape. Inside\r\nthis vat revolves slowly a hollow cylindrical drum, the circumference\r\nof which is covered with wire gauze of fine mesh. The drum is not\r\ncompletely immersed in the mixture of pulp and water, so that as it\r\nrevolves the water passes through the wire, while the pulp adheres to\r\nthe surface. The water flows regularly into the interior of the drum\r\nand runs away through pipes fitted at each side of the vat near the\r\naxis of the drum, and the pulp is brought up out of the water until it\r\ncomes into contact with a travelling felt. The thin moist sheet of pulp\r\nadheres to this felt, passes through squeezing rolls which remove part\r\nof the water, and is finally carried between two wooden or iron rollers\r\nof large diameter. The pulp adheres to, and is wound up on the upper\r\nroller, the felt being carried back by the lower roller to the vat.\r\nWhen the sheet on the upper roller has attained the desired thickness,\r\nit is immediately cut off and transferred to a pile of similar sheets,\r\na piece of coarse sacking or canvas being interposed between every wet\r\nboard. The dimensions of the full-sized board are determined by the\r\ndiameter of the upper roller and its length. A roll 74 inches wide and\r\n14 inches diameter will give a board 74 inches by 44 inches.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a sufficient number of wet boards has been obtained they are\r\nsubmitted to pressure in order to remove the excess of water and at the\r\nsame time compress the material into dense heavy boards. The pieces of\r\nsacking are then taken out and the boards dried by exposure to air at\r\nthe ordinary temperature or in a heated chamber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Double Cylinder Board Machine.]\r\n\r\nThe dried boards are finished off by glazing rolls. These rolls\r\ncompress the boards still further and impart a polished surface. The\r\namount of \"finish\" may be varied by the pressure, number of rollings,\r\ntemperature of the rolls, and by damping the surface of the dry boards\r\njust before they are glazed. The boards are cut to standard sizes\r\nbefore or after glazing.\r\n\r\n_Duplex Boards._--If the single board machine is fitted with two vats\r\ninstead of one, it is possible to manufacture a board with different\r\ncoloured surfaces. A board coloured red on one side and white on the\r\nother is manufactured by having one vat full of pulp coloured red and\r\nthe second vat full of white pulp. The thin moist sheets from the two\r\nvats are brought together and passed through the glazing rolls, which\r\ncause the moist sheets to adhere closely to one another, the double\r\nsheet of pulp so formed being wound up on the rollers at the end of the\r\nmachine. The board is then dried, glazed, and finished in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe same principle is occasionally adopted on the Fourdrinier\r\nmachine for duplex wrappers. Thus a common brown pulp is worked up\r\nin conjunction with a dyed pulp to produce a brown paper having one\r\nsurface of good paper suitably coloured. The brown pulp flows on to the\r\nwire of the paper machine, and after it has been deprived of part of\r\nthe water at the suction boxes, a thin stream of coloured pulp, diluted\r\nto a proper consistency, flows from a shallow trough, placed across and\r\nabove the wire, on to the wet brown web of paper in such a manner as to\r\ncompletely cover it as a thin even sheet of coloured pulp. The adhesion\r\nof the latter to the surface of the brown paper is practically perfect,\r\nand the weight of the couch and press rolls ensures uniform felting of\r\nthe fibres.\r\n\r\n_Middles._--This term is applied to a thin or thick cardboard made\r\nof common material, the colour and appearance of which is of little\r\nimportance for inferior goods. Boards of this kind are covered\r\nsubsequently with papers of all colours and qualities, and the origin\r\nof the word \"middle\" is easily seen. The manufacture of a board\r\nconsisting of two outside papers of good material and a middle produced\r\nfrom common stuff is effected by the continuous boxboard machine,\r\nunless the board is too thick to be passed over drying cylinders,\r\ncalendered, and reeled, in which case the boards are produced on an\r\nordinary wet machine and the paper pasted on the surface of the dry\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThe term is, however, now also applied to a common paper made of\r\nmechanical wood pulp with perhaps a little chemical pulp, used for\r\ntram tickets, cheap advertising circulars, common calendar cards, and\r\nsimilar purposes, to which no outer surface of a special character is\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUOUS BOARD MACHINE.\r\n\r\nThis machine differs from the single board machine in that the finished\r\nboard can be produced from the pulp at one operation. It is used\r\nprincipally for cards and boards of moderate thickness which can be\r\nwound up in the form of a reel at the end of the machine.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of pulp and water is pumped into two or more vats and\r\nformed into a number of thin sheets, which are all brought together\r\nbetween squeezing rolls and passed through heavy press rolls which\r\ncompress the several layers into a compact mass. The thick sheet\r\nobtained is dried over steam-heated cylinders which are placed at the\r\nend of the press rolls, and calendered. The whole process, indeed,\r\nresembles that of ordinary paper-making, the main difference being the\r\nmethod of producing the wet sheet or card.\r\n\r\nSome machines are constructed with six or seven vats and forty to fifty\r\ndrying cylinders, and are capable of turning out a large quantity of\r\nfinished material.\r\n\r\nThe board can be made of uniform quality and texture throughout, or be\r\nfinished off with high-grade paper on one or both sides. In the latter\r\ncase the constituents of the \"middle\" part are waste papers and raw\r\nmaterial of inferior quality, the outer surface of wood pulp, white or\r\ncoloured according to circumstances. The variety of papers and boards\r\nwhich can be produced is due to the fact that the several vats of pulp\r\nare independent of one another and can be filled with any kind of paper\r\nstock. The combined sheets forming the ultimate board are dried on\r\nthe ordinary cylinders, calendered, and reeled up at the end of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSPECIAL KINDS OF PAPER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of paper products obtained by submitting\r\nfinished paper to a number of special processes. Of these only a few of\r\nthe more important will be described.\r\n\r\nThese products can be divided approximately into three classes:--\r\n\r\n(1) Papers coated on one side or both sides with various substances,\r\nsuch as \"art,\" photographic papers, etc.\r\n\r\n(2) Papers impregnated with chemicals, such as blue print, medicated,\r\nand cheque papers.\r\n\r\n(3) Paper pulp converted into modified products by chemical treatment,\r\nsuch as vulcanised board, viscoid, etc.\r\n\r\nOf the first class, the coated papers used for art and chromo\r\nillustrations are the most important.\r\n\r\nOf the second class, the blue prints and papers impregnated with\r\nchemicals, chiefly employed for the production of engineers' drawings,\r\nmay be regarded as typical.\r\n\r\nIn the third class, vegetable parchment and vulcanised board are the\r\nmost familiar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Parchment Paper._--This is produced by the action of sulphuric acid\r\nupon ordinary paper, the most suitable for this purpose being made\r\nfrom unsized cotton rag, free from such additions as mechanical wood\r\npulp. The presence of the latter substance should be avoided, as it\r\nis liable to char or burn, so that in the finished product it shows\r\nitself in the form of small holes. The process depends upon the power\r\nof sulphuric acid to change the surface of the paper into a gelatinous\r\nmass, which has been shown to consist of a substance called amyloid.\r\n\r\nThe best parchment is made from pure cellulose such as rag or chemical\r\nwood pulp. The quality of the parchment depends upon attention to the\r\nstrength of the acid, the temperature of the acid bath, the period of\r\nimmersion, the complete removal of the acid, and the careful drying of\r\nthe wet parchment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Apparatus for making Parchment Paper.]\r\n\r\nThe acid is employed at a strength of 1·71 specific gravity, being\r\nprepared by diluting the commercial concentrated acid in a leaden\r\nvessel, with a sufficient quantity of water.\r\n\r\nThe parchment is generally prepared by passing a continuous sheet of\r\npaper through a bath of acid of the proper strength at a speed which\r\nensures the correct period of immersion. As the treated paper leaves\r\nthe bath it passes through squeezing rolls which remove the excess of\r\nacid, and the paper is then led through a series of tanks containing\r\nfresh water, the last traces of acid being neutralised by small\r\nadditions of ammonia, or some alkali, to the last washing tank. The wet\r\nparchment is then passed through suitable rollers and carefully dried\r\nover cylinders heated internally by steam. The paper is kept perfectly\r\nstretched as it dries, because it shrinks enormously, and would\r\notherwise become cockled and uneven.\r\n\r\nThick sheets of parchment paper are frequently made by passing three\r\nsheets of paper through the acid bath and bringing them together\r\nbetween the rollers before washing. The sheets unite when pressed\r\ntogether; the remainder of the process being the same as that employed\r\nfor single sheets.\r\n\r\nThe parchment exhibits remarkable differences to the original paper,\r\nthe strength being increased three or four times, the density about 30\r\nper cent., the latter being shown by the shrinkage, which amounts to at\r\nleast 30 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Vulcanised Paper._--Zinc chloride has the property of parchmentising\r\npaper in a manner similar to sulphuric acid. The product obtained when\r\nthis reagent is used is generally termed vulcanised fibre. The paper\r\nis passed as a continuous sheet into a bath of strong zinc chloride,\r\nhaving a density of 160-170 Twaddell, which causes the cellulose to\r\nswell up and partly gelatinise. A very large excess of strong zinc\r\nchloride is necessary, and the process is only rendered commercially\r\npossible by careful recovery of the zinc from the washing waters, which\r\nare submitted to chemical treatment.\r\n\r\nThe _vulcanised_ product is subsequently treated with nitric acid or\r\nwith a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids to render them waterproof.\r\nDextrin is frequently employed to retard the chemical action to permit\r\nof the necessary manipulation of the material before it is finally\r\nwashed. The complete removal of the excess of zinc and acid is a\r\nnecessary feature of the whole operation.\r\n\r\n_Willesden Paper._--When paper is passed through an ammoniacal solution\r\nof copper oxide, a superficial gelatinisation of the surface takes\r\nplace, so that the paper when washed and dried is impregnated with\r\ncopper oxide, which helps to preserve it, and it becomes waterproof.\r\nSuch material is well known as Willesden paper.\r\n\r\n_Blue Print or Cyanotype Papers._--This name is usually given\r\nto the process by means of which blue prints of engineers' and\r\narchitects' plans can be reproduced. It was discovered in 1842 by Sir\r\nJohn Herschel. It is a useful method of reproducing drawings, and\r\nincidentally is of great value to the amateur photographer because\r\nof the facility with which it can be applied for getting proofs from\r\nnegatives quickly and easily without special baths and chemicals. The\r\nprocess is based upon the reduction of a ferric salt to the ferrous\r\ncondition by light, and the formation of Prussian blue by the action of\r\npotassium ferricyanide. The _negative cyanotype_ gives white lines on a\r\nblue ground. Various formulæ are in common use.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------+---------+--------+--------+---------\r\n                --            |Herschel.| Clark. | Watt.  |Rockwood.\r\n  ----------------------------+---------+--------+--------+---------\r\n                              |         |        |        |\r\n  Solution 1.                 |         |        |        |\r\n      Potassium ferricyanide  |    16   |   27   |   48   |    10\r\n      Water                   |   100   |  100   |  100   |   100\r\n      Ammonia                 |    --   |  2·3   |   --   |    --\r\n      Saturated solution of   |         |        |        |\r\n        oxalic acid           |    --   |   20   |   --   |    --\r\n  ----------------------------+---------+--------+--------+---------\r\n                              |         |        |        |\r\n  Solution 2.                 |         |        |        |\r\n      Ammonia-citrate of iron |    20   |   30   |   50   |    30\r\n      Water                   |   100   |  100   |  100   |   100\r\n      Boric acid              |    --   |   --   |  0·5   |    --\r\n      Dextrin                 |    --   |   --   |   --   |     5\r\n  ----------------------------+---------+--------+--------+---------\r\n\r\nEqual parts of the two prepared solutions are mixed when required and\r\nspread evenly over well-sized paper. The paper is hung up, dried, and\r\npreserved in a dark dry place.\r\n\r\nThe _positive cyanotype_ gives blue lines on a white ground, being the\r\nreverse of the ordinary blue print. That is, no image is formed where\r\nthe light acts, and the reaction is the formation of blue due to the\r\nunion of a ferrous salt with ferrocyanide of potassium.\r\n\r\nPizzighelli in 1881 gave the following formula:--\r\n\r\n  -----------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n             --          |Solution 1.|Solution 2.|Solution 3.|Solution 4.\r\n  -----------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n  Water                  |    100    |    100    |    100    |    100\r\n  Gum arabic             |     20    |     --    |     --    |     --\r\n  Ammonia-citrate of iron|     --    |     50    |     --    |     --\r\n  Ferric chloride        |     --    |     --    |     50    |     --\r\n  Potassium ferrocyanide |     --    |     --    |     --    |     20\r\n  -----------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\nMix the first three solutions in the following order in the proportions\r\nstated:--\r\n\r\n                  Solution 1.   20 parts.\r\n                  Solution 2.    8   \"\r\n                  Solution 3.    5   \"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the solution, which at first gets thick and cloudy, is clear\r\nand thin, it is spread over the surface of well-sized paper, which is\r\nthen dried in a warm room.\r\n\r\nThe print, which appears yellow on a dark yellow ground, is treated\r\nwith the developer (solution 4) by means of a brush dipped in the\r\nsolution. When the image is deep blue in colour, the print is washed in\r\nwater and then placed in dilute hydrochloric acid (1 part of acid to 10\r\nparts of water) till the ground is quite white. A final washing with\r\nwater is then necessary.\r\n\r\nWaterhouse gives the following formula:--\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n            --         |Solution 1.|Solution 2.|Solution 3.|Solution 4.\r\n  ---------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n  Water                |    650    |    150    |     --    |    100\r\n  Gum arabic           |    170    |     --    |     --    |     --\r\n  Tartaric acid        |     --    |     40    |     --    |     --\r\n  Ferric chloride      |           |           |           |\r\n    solution 45° Baumé |     --    |     --    |    150    |     --\r\n  Ferrocyanide of      |     --    |     --    |     --    |     20\r\n    potassium          |           |           |           |\r\n  ---------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\nSolutions 1 and 2 are mixed and No. 3 added gradually with constant\r\nstirring. The mixture is left twenty-four hours, and diluted with water\r\nto a specific gravity of 1·100.\r\n\r\nThe paper is coated with the solution and used as already directed,\r\nbeing developed in ferrocyanide of potassium solution and washed with\r\nwater, treated with weak hydrochloric acid, and then finally cleaned\r\nfrom all traces of acid.\r\n\r\n_Black Lines on a White Ground._--This modification of the ordinary\r\nblue print is arrived at with the following formula:--\r\n\r\n  Water                                          96·0 parts.\r\n  Gelatine                                        1·5   \"\r\n  Perchloride of iron (in syrupy condition)       6·0   \"\r\n  Tartaric acid                                   6·0   \"\r\n  Sulphate of iron                                1·5   \"\r\n\r\nThe paper is coated with the solution. After printing, the image is\r\ndeveloped with a solution containing\r\n\r\n            Gallic acid                     1 part.\r\n            Alcohol                        10 parts.\r\n            Water                          50   \"\r\n\r\nA final washing of the print with water completes the operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOATED PAPERS.\r\n\r\nThis term should properly include all the varieties of special papers\r\nwhich are coated with extraneous matter for particular purposes, such\r\nas art, chromo, tinfoil, gilt, emery, carbon, photographic, marble, and\r\nsand papers. In practice however, the term is almost entirely limited\r\nto \"art\" papers used for illustration work and half-tone printing.\r\n\r\nAn \"art\" paper, using the definition given above, consists of an\r\nordinary sheet of paper, one or both sides of which have been coated\r\nby the application of a mixture of a mineral matter, such as china clay\r\nor satin white, and some adhesive, like casein or glue. The object\r\nof the coating is to impart to the paper a perfectly smooth surface,\r\nrendered necessary because of the conditions under which the printing\r\nof the illustrations is carried out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--General arrangement of Plant for making \"Art\"\r\nPaper.]\r\n\r\nThe machine used for coating the paper consists of a large hollow drum\r\nabout 40 inches diameter and 48 inches wide. The paper is brought over\r\nupon the drum in a continuous sheet, and the coating mixture applied\r\nto the surface by means of a revolving brush or an endless felt which\r\nrotates in a copper trough containing a coating mixture which is\r\nusually maintained at a temperature of 120° Fahr.\r\n\r\nThe amount of material put on to the surface of the paper is varied by\r\naltering the proportion of water in the trough. As the wet coated paper\r\nis drawn over the drum it comes into contact with a number of flat\r\nbrushes which move from side to side and brush the coating well into\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Sectional Elevation of \"Coating\" Plant.]\r\n\r\nThe last two or three brushes on the drum are made of very fine\r\nbristles, so that when the coated paper leaves the machine the surface\r\nis perfectly even and free from brush marks. The wet paper is then\r\ndrawn up an inclined ladder by an ingenious device, which causes the\r\npaper to fall into festoons or loops, and these are carried bodily\r\nforward by means of travelling chains. The process, somewhat difficult\r\nto describe, is more easily understood by a study of the illustrations\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThe paper is dried by a current of warm air which can be obtained by\r\nmeans of steam pipes placed below the festoons or with a special air\r\nblower. The dry paper is then led through guide rolls and wound up in\r\nthe form of a reel.\r\n\r\nThe paper at this stage has a dull coated surface, which is somewhat\r\nrough and unfinished, and a high polish is imparted to it by a machine\r\nknown as a supercalender.\r\n\r\nThe supercalender consists of a number of alternate steel and cotton or\r\npaper rolls placed vertically in a stack one above the other. When the\r\ncoated paper is led through this machine the friction of the alternate\r\nsteel and cotton rolls produces a high finish on its surface.\r\n\r\nAn art paper coated on both sides is manufactured by passing the paper\r\nthrough the coating machine twice. Machines have been devised for\r\ncoating both sides of the paper at one operation, but these are not in\r\nvery general use.\r\n\r\nTinted art papers are prepared in the same manner, the desired colour\r\nbeing obtained by the addition of pigments or aniline dyes to the\r\nmixture in the trough containing the coating materials. When the two\r\nsides of such tinted papers are coloured differently, they are often\r\ndescribed as duplex coated papers.\r\n\r\n_Imitation Art Papers_ are prepared by quite a different process,\r\nalthough they have the appearance, more or less, of the coated paper.\r\nThey are merely esparto papers very heavily loaded, containing\r\nfrequently as much as 25 to 30 per cent. of mineral matter prepared as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nBleached esparto half-stuff is beaten together with any suitable\r\nproportion of chemical wood pulp in an ordinary beating engine, and a\r\nlarge quantity of china clay is added at the same time. The beating\r\nis carried out under conditions which favour the retention of as much\r\nchina clay as the pulp will hold while being converted into paper on\r\nthe Fourdrinier machine.\r\n\r\nAfter the paper passes over the drying cylinders of the machine it is\r\npassed through the calenders in the usual way, but the surface of the\r\npaper is damped by means of a fine water spray just before it enters\r\nthe calender rolls. The result is that a \"water-finish,\" so called, is\r\nimparted to the paper, and a close imitation of the genuine art paper\r\nis obtained, the effect of this peculiar treatment being to compress\r\nthe fibres and bring the clay up, as it were, to the surface.\r\n\r\nA paper containing such a large proportion of mineral matter intimately\r\nmixed with the fibre is naturally very weak. It easily tears, and if\r\nmoistened with water goes all to pieces. At the same time it is a cheap\r\nsubstitute for high-class art paper, being suitable for circulars,\r\ntemporary catalogues, and similar printed matter.\r\n\r\nIn an \"art\" paper the nature of the fibrous constituents is too often\r\nregarded as a matter of secondary importance, because in the process\r\nof printing the ink does not come into contact at all with the paper,\r\nand an impression is produced merely on a layer of clay which is bound\r\ntogether by the glue.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations are not absolutely permanent, and it is perfectly\r\neasy to remove the whole of the impression and the coating itself by\r\nimmersing a sheet of the paper in warm water and rubbing the surface\r\ngently with the fingers, or with a camel-hair brush.\r\n\r\nIn fact the amount of coating matter which has been brushed on to\r\na paper can be determined approximately by weighing a piece of the\r\ncoated paper, removing the mineral matter and glue from both sides as\r\nindicated, allowing the paper to dry again, and then re-weighing, the\r\nloss in weight representing the amount of coating.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising to find that the true paper is merely regarded as\r\na convenient means of producing, so to speak, a smooth surface of clay,\r\nand an examination of the material between the two clay surfaces often\r\nreveals a paper of very low quality.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two empirical methods for testing the condition of\r\ncoating on an art paper. If the coating is firm and adherent, then on\r\npressing the moistened thumb on to the surface none of the coating\r\nmatter is removed, but in a badly-made art paper some of the coating\r\nadheres to the thumb.\r\n\r\nAnother method is to crumple a sheet of paper between the fingers, and\r\nif any of the coating comes away easily the paper is considered of poor\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThe complete examination of an art paper, apart from the practical test\r\nof printing, involves the determination of the amount of coating matter\r\nadded to the paper, the proportion of glue in the coating, and the\r\nusual analysis of the paper itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACKING PAPERS.\r\n\r\nThis term may be applied to wrappings specially treated with substances\r\nwhich render the paper air and water proof. They are principally used\r\nfor preserving food, or such articles as tobacco, which require to be\r\nkept slightly moist.\r\n\r\n_Waxed Paper._--The paper in the form of a continuous sheet is passed\r\nthrough a bath of melted wax at a high temperature, any excess being\r\nremoved by squeezing rolls through which the hot waxed paper is passed.\r\nThe paper is led over skeleton drums and thoroughly cooled before being\r\ncut into sheets.\r\n\r\n_Butter Paper._--Ordinary parchment paper is generally used, but\r\nfor special purposes a solution containing albumen and saltpetre is\r\nutilised for impregnating paper.\r\n\r\n_Hardware Paper._--Needles and silver goods are frequently wrapped\r\nin paper impregnated or mixed with substances which are supposed to\r\nprevent deleterious fumes from coming into contact with them. The use\r\nof black papers heavily loaded with pigment, sized with glue and an\r\nexcess of alum, is commonly resorted to. For silver ware, paper dipped\r\nin a solution of caustic soda containing zinc oxide is used. A recent\r\npatent suggests the impregnation of paper with heavy hydrocarbon oils,\r\nwhich being slightly volatile cover the goods, such as needles, with a\r\nthin film.\r\n\r\n_Paraffin Paper._--Large quantities of this paper are consumed for\r\npacking food and other articles which need protection from air and\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nThe paper is either passed through a bath of paraffin or passed over a\r\nroller which rotates in a trough of paraffin.\r\n\r\nIf the paper is to be coated on both sides it is passed through the\r\nbath containing the paraffin in a melted condition, the excess of which\r\nis scraped from the paper as it leaves the bath. The paper is cooled by\r\nexposure to air, and when the paraffin has solidified upon the sheet\r\nthe paper is wound up on a roller at the end of the machine.\r\n\r\nIf the paper is to be coated on one side only it is passed over a\r\nheated roller which revolves in a bath of melted paraffin, the other\r\noperations of drying and finishing being the same as in the case of a\r\npaper coated on both sides.\r\n\r\n_Tinfoil Papers_, required for packing tea, coffee, and similar\r\nfoodstuffs, are prepared by coating cheap paper with a solution of\r\ngum and finely powdered tin. The manufacture of the fine powder\r\nis accomplished by melting tin at a low temperature and shaking\r\nit continually as it cools down, whereby a mixture of fine powder\r\nand large particles is produced, the latter being separated out by\r\nagitation of water.\r\n\r\nTin in a fine state of division can also be obtained by a chemical\r\nprocess. Granulated tin is dissolved in strong hydrochloric acid, the\r\nsolution diluted with water, and a stick of zinc introduced into the\r\nsolution. The tin is gradually precipitated.\r\n\r\nThe dried powder is coated on to the paper with gum, and when the\r\npaper is dry the necessary degree of brilliancy produced by suitable\r\ncalendering.\r\n\r\n_Transfer Papers._--A number of important operations require the use\r\nof what are known as _transfer_ papers, so that a design written or\r\nprinted upon a specially prepared surface can be _transferred_ to\r\nanother surface from which duplicate copies may be obtained. The\r\nprinciple upon which all such operations are based is the coating of\r\nsuitable paper with starch, flour, and gum, singly or mixed, so as to\r\ngive a surface firm enough to take the design, but which readily breaks\r\nup when the printed side is pressed against the wood, stone, or metal\r\nobject intended to receive the design.\r\n\r\nThus a paper may first be dusted over with dry starch, or coated with\r\nstarch paste and then dried. A layer of dextrine may then be put over\r\nthe starch coating, and the design printed upon the dextrine surface.\r\nWhen the paper is turned face downward on a sticky metal plate the\r\ndesign adheres to the metal, and the paper is easily pulled off, owing\r\nto the dry starch layer between it and the dextrine being non-adhesive.\r\n\r\nThis principle is utilised in producing designs upon tins used for\r\npacking, metal advertisement plates, domestic articles of every kind,\r\nstoneware and earthenware goods.\r\n\r\nIt is further applied in the preparation of lithographic stones\r\nrequired for printing.\r\n\r\nEach class of work demands paper of a suitable character, but the\r\nprinciple of an easily detached surface-coating is the same for all.\r\nThe main difficulty experienced is the liability of paper to stretch\r\nwhen damped, and various methods are devised to obviate this, either by\r\nemploying paper which stretches very little when damp, or by making the\r\npaper partially waterproof before use.\r\n\r\n_Papier-mâché._--This name indicates a preparation of paper or paper\r\npulp mixed with various mineral substances firmly cemented together by\r\nanimal or vegetable adhesives.\r\n\r\nThe _paper pulp_ used for high-class goods consists of pure wood\r\ncellulose, while for the commoner qualities mechanical wood pulp, waste\r\npapers, and any similar fibrous material are employed.\r\n\r\nThe _mineral_ substances used are china clay, chalk, gypsum, barytes,\r\nochre, sienna, and other mineral pigments.\r\n\r\nThe _adhesive_ materials are glue, casein, gum, starch, paste,\r\ndextrine, Iceland moss, or wax.\r\n\r\nFor experimental purposes, small quantities of papier-mâché may be\r\nprepared in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nWhen old newspapers or brown papers are used as the fibrous basis of\r\nthe papier-mâché, they are first torn up into small pieces, moistened\r\nwith hot water, tied up in a small cloth bag or sack, which must\r\nonly be half filled, and then immersed in a basin of warm water and\r\nthoroughly kneaded by hand, so that the paper is gradually reduced\r\nto the condition of pulp. If the kneading process is carried out\r\nthoroughly the paper is entirely reduced to pulp. The excess of water\r\ncan be removed by pressure and the preparation of the final mixture\r\ncompleted by the incorporation of clay, pigment, and adhesive.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of papier-mâché for goods on a large scale a beating\r\nengine is used in order to break up the old paper or wood pulp into a\r\nfibrous condition.\r\n\r\nThe following formulæ can be used for making papier-mâché:--\r\n\r\n  -----------+-----------+---------------+-----------\r\n      (1)    |    (2)    |     (3)       |    (4)\r\n  -----------+-----------+---------------+-----------\r\n  Pulp    22 | Pulp   22 | Pulp       12 | Pulp    33\r\n  Clay    37 | Chalk  30 | Rosin size 22 | Starch   9\r\n  Casein  37 | Glue    4 | Flour      11 | Clay     9\r\n  Water    4 | Water  44 | China clay 11 | Water   49\r\n             |           | Water      44 |\r\n         --- |       --- |           --- |        ---\r\n         100 |       100 |           100 |        100\r\n  -----------+-----------+---------------+-----------\r\n\r\n_Plaster Moulds._--Plaster of Paris or gypsum is the main article used\r\nfor moulds and pattern. The preparation of gypsum for casting is made\r\nas follows:--The gypsum is gradually worked up into a creamy paste with\r\nwater, the mixing being done quickly yet thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe pattern of which it is desired to form a mould must be coated with\r\noil. Around the pattern placed on a table a wall of wood or pasteboard\r\nis fixed, so that a basin will be formed of suitable depth, preventing\r\nthe gypsum from flowing away. Patterns of figures or of curved articles\r\nhave to be made in two or more parts. For that purpose the pattern is\r\nusually cut into two pieces. Two moulds are now readily obtainable by\r\nfirst oiling the pattern and by pouring the gypsum in a thin state\r\ngradually over the surface, to avoid the forming of air bubbles.\r\n\r\nThe rapid drying of the soaked gypsum is sometimes inconvenient, but\r\nthe addition of a saturated solution of borax in water to the gypsum\r\nmixture can be resorted to as a check.\r\n\r\nVarious means are employed for hardening and strengthening the plaster\r\ncast, such as the addition of coarse paper fibres, shreds of canvas,\r\niron filings, or wire.\r\n\r\n_Colouring._--Usually a cheap water colour only is required; a light\r\ncoating of a cheap varnish may be sufficient. In other cases a water\r\ncolour serving as a filler for smoothing the surface may receive a\r\nfinish of one or more coats of resinous solutions in alcohol or of\r\ncopal varnish. Many goods are coated with asphaltum or Japan varnish\r\nand dried in cold or hot air.\r\n\r\nSome of the articles may be decorated with scrolls or arabesques in oil\r\ncolours or enamels, or the lines may be covered with bronze powder, or\r\nwith metal, gold, or aluminium leaf.\r\n\r\n_Varnishing._--The following varnish recipes are suitable:--\r\n\r\n  --------------+---------------+--------------+-------------\r\n       (1)      |     (2)       |     (3)      |     (4)\r\n  --------------+---------------+--------------+-------------\r\n  Shellac    20 | Shellac    10 | Shellac    6 | Sandarac  15\r\n  Alcohol    70 | Rosin      10 | Sandarac   3 | Mastic     5\r\n  Lamp black 10 | Alcohol    60 | Mastic    18 | Turpentine 5\r\n                | Lamp black 20 | Alcohol   73 | Alcohol   75\r\n            --- |           --- |          --- |          ---\r\n            100 |           100 |          100 |          100\r\n  --------------+---------------+--------------+-------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCHEMICALS USED IN PAPER-MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of paper is a highly technical industry, which requires\r\na practical knowledge of mechanical engineering, as well as an intimate\r\nacquaintance with the many important chemical problems connected with\r\nthe art.\r\n\r\nThe following brief description of the various chemicals used in the\r\nmanufacture of paper is divided into certain classes, based upon the\r\norder of the operations through which the raw material passes before\r\nits final conversion into paper:--\r\n\r\n(1) The alkaline processes used for treating raw fibre: soda ash;\r\ncaustic soda; lime; recovered ash.\r\n\r\n(2) The conversion of wood into sulphite pulp: sulphur; limestone.\r\n\r\n(3) The operation of bleaching: bleaching powder; antichlors; acids.\r\n\r\n(4) The sizing and loading of paper: casein; gelatine; rosin size;\r\nalum; starch; silicate of soda; pigments and soluble dyes; mordants.\r\n\r\nMineral substances for loading: clay, blanc fixe, etc.\r\n\r\n_Carbonate of Soda._--This substance, also known under the trade names\r\nof alkali and soda ash, is used in the paper mill for the manufacture\r\nof caustic soda. It is purchased by the paper-maker from the chemical\r\nworks, and used together with the recovered ash (see page 78) for the\r\nproduction of caustic soda solution, which is required in the treatment\r\nof raw fibres.\r\n\r\nIt is also used for the preparation of rosin size (see \"Rosin Size\")\r\nand in softening hard waters for steam-raising purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSODIUM CARBONATE TABLE.\r\n\r\nShowing percentage by weight and pounds per 100 gallons in solutions of\r\nvarious densities.\r\n\r\n  ---------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------\r\n           | Percentage by Weight. |   100 gallons contain pounds of\r\n  Twaddell.+-----------------------+---------+-------------+-----------\r\n           | Na_{2}O.|Na_{2}CO_{3}.| Na_{2}O.|Na_{2}CO_{3}.| 48 per\r\n           |         |             |         |             |cent.

In practice this process\r\nis largely resorted to for the manufacture of pulp from esparto, straw,\r\nand wood, the spent caustic soda being recovered and used again.\r\n\r\nThe paper-maker prepares the caustic required for digesting the raw\r\nmaterial from recovered ash and carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\nA convenient volume of clear liquor obtained by lixiviating the\r\nrecovered ash is boiled with lime in suitable causticising pans, the\r\nreaction being represented as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Na_{2}CO_{3} + CaO  + H_{2}O = 2 NaOH       + CaCO_{3}.\r\n  Soda ash     + Lime + Water  = Caustic soda + Chalk.\r\n\r\nAccording to this equation, 100 lbs. of soda ash require 53 lbs. of\r\nquicklime, but a slight excess is generally added, 58 or 60 lbs. being\r\nthe usual amount actually employed. Several precautions should be\r\nobserved in the process of causticising.\r\n\r\n(1) The liquor from the recovered soda should be bright and clear,\r\nindicating complete incineration of the ash.\r\n\r\n(2) The liquor is best causticised at a density between 1·050 and 1·100\r\n(10-20, Twaddell). With stronger solutions the reaction is complicated\r\nand the yield of caustic soda reduced. Lunge has shown that if the\r\ndensity of the solution is 1·025 the proportion of soda causticised is\r\n99·5 per cent., whereas at a density of 1·150 it is only 94·5 per cent.\r\nIn the latter case the caustic soda formed acts upon the chalk produced\r\nand is reconverted into carbonate.\r\n\r\n(3) The large quantities of chalk residue resulting from the reaction\r\nmust be thoroughly and carefully washed. The economy of the whole\r\nprocess depends in no small measure upon this seemingly small detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSTIC SODA TABLES.\r\n\r\n  Showing quantity of liquor obtained from 1 cwt. of caustic soda and\r\n      the amount of caustic soda in 100 gallons of liquor (adapted from\r\n      Lunge and others).\r\n\r\n  ---------+--------------------------++---------+-------------------------\r\n           |  Gallons obtained per    ||         | Pounds of Caustic Soda\r\n           |      hundredweight       ||         | per 100 gallons Liquor.\r\n           |        of Caustic.       ||         |\r\n  Twaddell.+------------+-------------++Twaddell.+------------+------------\r\n           |60 per cent.|77 per cent. ||         |60 per cent.|77 per cent.\r\n           |Caustic.    |Caustic      ||         |Caustic.    |Caustic\r\n           |            |Pure.        ||         |            |Pure.\r\n  ---------+------------+-------------++---------+------------+------------\r\n       1   |    1,777   |    2,358    ||    1    |    6·3     |    4·75\r\n       2   |      896   |    1,179    ||    2    |   12·5     |    9·5\r\n       3   |      596   |      767    ||    3    |   18·8     |   14·6\r\n       4   |      448   |      574    ||    4    |   25·0     |   19·5\r\n       5   |      359   |      457    ||    5    |   31·2     |   24·5\r\n       6   |      298   |      384    ||    6    |   37·6     |   29·2\r\n       7   |      256   |      330    ||    7    |   43·8     |   34·0\r\n       8   |      223   |      287    ||    8    |   50·1     |   39·0\r\n       9   |      199   |      256    ||    9    |   56·2     |   43·7\r\n      10   |      178   |      229    ||   10    |   62·9     |   48·9\r\n      11   |      162   |      208    ||   11    |   69·1     |   53·7\r\n      12   |      148   |      190    ||   12    |   75·7     |   58·7\r\n      13   |      136   |      176    ||   13    |   82·1     |   63·7\r\n      14   |      126   |      166    ||   14    |   88·5     |   67·5\r\n      15   |      117·5 |      152    ||   15    |   95·0     |   73·5\r\n      16   |      110   |      141·5  ||   16    |  101·5     |   79·0\r\n      17   |      103·5 |      135    ||   17    |  107·8     |   83·0\r\n      18   |       98   |      125·5  ||   18    |  114·4     |   89·0\r\n      19   |       92·8 |      119·5  ||   19    |  120·8     |   93·8\r\n      20   |       88   |      114    ||   20    |  127·2     |   98·0\r\n      25   |       70   |       90·3  ||   25    |  159·5     |  124·0\r\n      30   |       56·5 |       73    ||   30    |  197·3     |  153·0\r\n      35   |       48   |       61·5  ||   35    |  234·9     |  182·2\r\n      40   |       41   |       53    ||   40    |  272·6     |  211·6\r\n      45   |       35·3 |       45·5  ||   45    |  317·4     |  246·3\r\n      50   |       31   |       40    ||   50    |  362·1     |  281·0\r\n  ---------+------------+-------------++---------+------------+------------\r\n\r\n\r\nDILUTION TABLE FOR STRONG LIQUORS.\r\n\r\n  Showing number of gallons of water required to reduce the density\r\n      of 100 gallons of liquor from a higher density, D, to a lower\r\n      density, _d._ (See page 163).\r\n\r\n  -----------+---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Higher     |     Lower Density, _d._\r\n  Density, D +-----+-----+-----+-----+---+-----+---+-----+-----+---+---\r\n  (Twaddell).| 14. | 13. | 12. | 11. |10.|  9. | 8.|  7. |  6. | 5.| 4.\r\n  -----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+---+-----+---+-----+-----+---+---\r\n       42    |200  |223  |250  |281·8|320|367  |425|500  |600  |740|950\r\n       40    |185  |207  |233·3|263·6|300|344·4|400|471·4|566·6|700|900\r\n       38    |171  |192  |216·6|245·5|280|322·2|375|442·8|533·3|660|850\r\n       36    |157  |177  |200  |227·3|260|300  |350|414·3|500  |620|800\r\n       34    |143  |161·5|183·3|209·1|240|277·7|325|385·7|466·6|580|750\r\n       32    |128·6|146  |166·6|191  |220|255·5|300|357·1|433·3|540|700\r\n       30    |114·3|130·6|150  |172·8|200|233·3|275|328·5|400  |500|650\r\n       28    |100  |115·3|133·3|154·6|180|211·1|250|300  |366·6|460|600\r\n       26    | 85·7|100  |116·6|136·4|160|188·8|225|271·4|333·3|420|550\r\n       24    | 71·4| 84·6|100  |118·2|140|166·6|200|243  |300  |380|500\r\n       22    | 57·1| 69·2| 83·3|100  |120|144·4|175|214·4|266·6|340|450\r\n       20    | 43  | 53·6| 66·6| 81·8|100|122·2|150|185·7|233·3|300|400\r\n       18    | 28·6| 38·4| 50  | 63·7| 80|100  |125|157  |200  |260|350\r\n       16    | 14·3| 23  | 33·3| 45·5| 60| 77·7|100|128·5|166·6|220|300\r\n  -----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+---+-----+---+-----+-----+---+---\r\n\r\n_Lime and Limestone._--Carbonate of soda and recovered ash are\r\nconverted into caustic soda by means of lime. About sixty parts of\r\nlime are necessary for the conversion of 100 parts of carbonate of\r\nsoda. Large quantities of insoluble carbonate of lime are produced\r\nin this operation, and great care is necessary to prevent a loss of\r\ncaustic soda which occurs if the residue is not thoroughly washed. In\r\nsome cases the residual chalk is drained by vacuum filters in order to\r\nremove all traces of soluble alkali. Processes have been devised for\r\ncalcining the residue so as to convert the carbonate into caustic lime\r\nto be used over again, but no economical and practical method has yet\r\nbeen found. The treatment of the residual chalk with sulphuric acid for\r\nthe production of calcium sulphate appears feasible, but the substance\r\nobtained is very impure, and therefore has little commercial value.\r\n\r\nLimestone is required in considerable quantity for the preparation of\r\nsulphite of lime for the manufacture of wood pulp.\r\n\r\n_Recovered Ash._--The black liquor obtained during the process of the\r\nboiling of straw, esparto, and other paper-making fibres contains a\r\nlarge proportion of non-fibrous organic constituents derived from the\r\nfibres, the quantity of which may be gauged from the fact that these\r\nfibres generally lose 50 per cent. of their weight when being boiled.\r\nThe black liquor on evaporation yields a thick resinous mass, which is\r\nconverted into carbonate of soda when burnt.\r\n\r\nAdvantage is taken of this fact to carry out a process of incineration\r\non a large scale, so that heat derived from the burning off of the\r\nresinous mass is utilised for evaporation of weaker liquors. The ash is\r\ndrawn from special furnaces, put aside, and allowed to char quietly, so\r\nthat the carbonaceous matter is more or less completely burnt away. The\r\nash in this form contains about 40 per cent. of soda, its composition\r\nbeing determined by the nature of the fibre which has been treated. In\r\nthe case of straw, the amount of silicate is considerable, as shown by\r\nthe following typical analysis:--\r\n\r\n    Sodium carbonate                     70·2\r\n    Sodium hydrate                        2·3\r\n    Sodium sulphate                       4·1\r\n    Sodium chloride                       7·5\r\n    Silica                                7·5\r\n    Oxides of iron and alumina            0·75\r\n    Unburnt carbon, etc.                  7·65\r\n                                        ------\r\n                                        100·00\r\n                                        ------\r\n\r\nAt the present time there is no process in general use for the recovery\r\nof the liquors used in the treatment of wood by the sulphite process.\r\nMany schemes have been proposed, the most promising of which is that of\r\nDrewsen.\r\n\r\n_Sulphur and Sulphites._--The pale yellow brittle substance known as\r\nsulphur is too familiar to require any detailed description. It unites\r\nwith oxygen in various proportions, and these in contact with water\r\nform the various sulphur acids known to commerce. Sulphur burned with a\r\nlimited quantity of air forms sulphurous acid gas, and this substance\r\nis the chief product of oxidation, which by further treatment can be\r\nconverted into sulphites.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of the sulphur compounds required in the preparation\r\nof wood pulp, the furnace for burning the sulphur consists of a\r\nflat-bottomed cast iron retort which is very shallow, and provided with\r\na curved top, to which a pipe is fixed, so that the sulphurous acid may\r\nbe conveyed away from the furnace. In the most recent form of sulphur\r\noven a small conical-shaped revolving furnace is employed, which\r\nproduces a satisfactory gas of constant composition very economically.\r\n\r\n_Bisulphite of Lime._--This compound is obtained when the sulphurous\r\nacid gas is brought into contact with moistened limestone. In the\r\nmanufacture of bisulphite of lime on a large scale the sulphurous acid\r\ngas is drawn or pumped up tall circular towers filled with blocks of\r\nlimestone, kept moistened by a carefully regulated stream of water\r\nflowing from the top of the tower.\r\n\r\nIn another system known as the acid tank process, the gas is forced\r\ninto large circular vats containing milk of lime.\r\n\r\nIn either case a solution is prepared containing bisulphite of lime,\r\ntogether with a certain proportion of free sulphurous acid, the object\r\nof the pulp manufacturer being to obtain a solution containing as large\r\na proportion of free sulphurous acid as possible. The composition of a\r\nsolution will vary on this account, and the following may be quoted as\r\nbeing an example of such a liquor:--\r\n\r\n    Free sulphurous acid                 3·23 per cent.\r\n    Combined sulphurous acid             0·77  \"    \"\r\n                                         ----\r\n                                         4·00  \"    \"\r\n                                         ----\r\n\r\nFor experimental purposes the bisulphite of lime solution may be\r\nprepared by passing sulphurous acid gas into a mixture of water and\r\nsulphite of lime. The latter compound is insoluble in water, but\r\ngradually dissolves when the gas is absorbed. A known weight of\r\nsulphite of lime is added to a measured volume of water, and the\r\nsulphurous acid gas discharged into the mixture from a siphon of\r\ncompressed sulphurous acid. The amount of gas absorbed is determined\r\nby weighing the siphon before and after use, the loss of weight\r\nrepresenting the gas discharged.\r\n\r\nThe following figures may be quoted as an example:--\r\n\r\n                                  Quantities used.\r\n    Calcium sulphite                     536 grammes.\r\n    Water                               7100 c.c.\r\n    Gas absorbed                         534 grammes.\r\n    Density of solution                  18° Twaddell.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the solution prepared is--\r\n\r\n    Combined sulphurous acid                   3·50\r\n    Free sulphurous acid                       6·54\r\n    Lime                                       3·06\r\n    Water                                     86·90\r\n                                             ------\r\n                                             100·00\r\n                                             ------\r\n\r\n_Analysis._--The examination of sulphite liquors for free and combined\r\nsulphurous acid is made by means of standard iodine solution and normal\r\ncaustic soda solution.\r\n\r\nA known volume of the sulphite liquor is first titrated with standard\r\niodine solution, the number of cubic centimetres required being a\r\nmeasure of the total sulphurous acid.\r\n\r\nEach cubic centimetre standard iodine solution = ·0032 grammes SO_{2}.\r\nThe titrated liquor is then treated with standard caustic soda in\r\nquantity sufficient to exactly neutralise the acid. The volume of\r\ncaustic soda solution used minus the number of cubic centimetres of\r\niodine first added is a measure of the free sulphurous acid.\r\n\r\n_Bleaching Powder._--This substance is prepared on a large scale by\r\nallowing chlorine gas to act upon dry slaked lime. The lime absorbs\r\nnearly one-half its weight of chlorine and forms a dry white powder,\r\nhaving a very pungent odour. The best bleaching powder contains about\r\n37 per cent. of what is termed \"available chlorine.\" The substance,\r\non being treated with water, gives a greenish-coloured solution known\r\nas bleach liquor, and when raw paper-making material, after having\r\nbeen digested with caustic soda, is treated with this solution, it is\r\ngradually bleached to a white colour. The composition of the powder may\r\nbe represented approximately as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Available chlorine (combined with lime)      36·00\r\n    Chlorine in the form of chloride              0·32\r\n    Chlorine in the form of chlorate              0·26\r\n    Lime                                         44·66\r\n    Magnesia                                      0·43\r\n    Silica, iron oxides, etc.                     1·33\r\n    Insoluble matter                             17·00\r\n                                                ------\r\n                                                100·00\r\n                                                ------\r\n\r\nSince the amount of bleach used for wood pulps varies from 8 per cent.\r\nto 25 per cent. of powder on the dry wood pulp, the cost of bleaching\r\nin some cases is considerable. The economy of the process depends in\r\nsome measure upon the care exercised in the purchase of bleaching\r\npowder of standard quality, the storage of same in a dark, cool place,\r\nand the efficient treatment or exhaustion of the powder when the bleach\r\nliquor is prepared.\r\n\r\nThe powder is usually agitated for about an hour with water sufficient\r\nto produce a liquor of 13°-15° Twaddell. The undissolved powder is\r\nallowed to settle and the clear solution siphoned off, after which\r\nthe sediment is washed once or twice to remove all the soluble matter\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEACH LIQUOR TABLE.\r\n\r\n  Showing for bleaching powder solutions of known density the quantity\r\n      of powder necessary to produce 100 gallons of liquor and the\r\n      number of gallons obtained from 1 cwt. of powder (adapted from\r\n      Lunge and Beichofen).\r\n\r\n  ---------+----------+--------------------------+-------------------------\r\n           |Available |Number of Gallons obtained|Pounds of Powder per 100\r\n           |Chlorine  |from 112 lbs. of Powder.  |gallons of Liquor.\r\n  Twaddell.|Pounds    +------------+-------------+------------+------------\r\n           |per 100   |34 per cent.|35 per cent. |34 per cent.|35 per cent.\r\n           |gallons.  |  Powder.   |  Powder.    |  Powder.   |  Powder.\r\n  ---------+----------+------------+-------------+------------+------------\r\n     0·25  |    0·70  |    5,464   |    5,600    |    2·05    |    2·00\r\n     0·50  |    1·40  |    2,725   |    2,800    |    4·11    |    4·00\r\n     1     |    2·71  |    1,405   |    1,445    |    7·97    |    7·74\r\n     2     |    5·58  |      681   |      702    |   16·41    |   15·94\r\n     3     |    8·48  |      448   |      462    |   24·95    |   24·23\r\n     4     |   11·41  |      334   |      340    |   33·55    |   32·60\r\n     5     |   14·47  |      264   |      270    |   42·58    |   41·34\r\n     6     |   17·36  |      219·5 |      225    |   51·06    |   49·60\r\n     7     |   20·44  |      186   |      191    |   60·11    |   58·40\r\n     8     |   23·75  |      160   |      165    |   69·85    |   67·85\r\n     9     |   26·62  |      141   |      147    |   78·30    |   76·57\r\n    10     |   29·60  |      129   |      132·5  |   87·06    |   84·54\r\n    11     |   32·68  |      116·5 |      120    |   96·11    |   93·37\r\n    12     |   35·81  |      106·5 |      109·5  |  105·32    |  102·31\r\n    13     |   39·10  |       98   |      100    |  115·00    |  111·70\r\n    14     |   42·31  |       90   |       92·5  |  124·45    |  120·90\r\n    15     |   45·70  |       84   |       86    |  134·41    |  130·56\r\n    16     |   48·96  |       78   |       80    |  143·80    |  139·71\r\n    17     |   52·27  |       73·5 |       75    |  153·53    |  149·34\r\n    18     |   55·18  |       69   |       71    |  162·30    |  157·65\r\n    19     |   58·40  |       65·5 |       67    |  171·00    |  166·86\r\n    20     |   61·50  |       61·5 |       64    |  180·88    |  175·71\r\n  ---------+----------+------------+-------------+------------+------------\r\n\r\nThe best method for extracting powder is to agitate the material with\r\nwater for a short period, and to stop the mixing process directly the\r\nmaximum density has been obtained, which usually takes place in 15\r\nminutes. Prolonged agitating prevents the powder from settling readily.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantities of liquor which can be obtained from bleaching\r\npowder are shown on page 162.

The chief\r\nadvantage of the use of sulphites is to be found in the fact that the\r\nsubstances obtained by the reaction are neutral.\r\n\r\nThe best practice in bleaching is to avoid the necessity for using any\r\nforms of antichlors by careful regulation of the bleaching process. It\r\nhas already been suggested in previous references to bleaching that\r\nthe desired results are obtained when the pulp and bleach are left\r\nin contact with one another in tanks or drainers until the bleach is\r\ncompletely exhausted, the residual salts in solution being removed by\r\nthorough washing.\r\n\r\n_Gelatine._--For animal-sized or tub-sized papers gelatine is used. It\r\ncan be prepared by the paper-maker from hide clippings, sheep skins,\r\nbone, etc., or can be purchased ready made.\r\n\r\nBeadle gives the following interesting details as to the amount of\r\ngelatine which can be obtained from wet hide pieces:--\r\n\r\nWEIGHT OF WET HIDE PIECES, 2,128 LBS.\r\n\r\n        -------------+--------+-----------+----------\r\n                     |        | Per cent. |Weight of\r\n        Draught.     |Gallons.|Gelatine in|Gelatine.\r\n                     |        | Solution. |   Lbs.\r\n        -------------+--------+-----------+----------\r\n              1      | 126·48 |   6·775   |  85·64\r\n              2      | 128·96 |   6·052   |  78·04\r\n        3 and 4 mixed| 135·20 |   9·446   | 127·63\r\n                     +--------+           +----------\r\n              Total  | 390·64 |           | 291·31\r\n        -------------+--------+-----------+----------\r\n\r\nPercentage of gelatine on weight of wet skins = 13·69.\r\n\r\nA similar trial on the same class of wet hide pieces gave a yield of\r\n13·23 per cent.\r\n\r\nTwo trials, of a somewhat different class of wet hide pieces, gave\r\nrespectively 13·11 and 12·8 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the draught water should be approximately as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n          --------+-------------+----------\r\n          Draught.|At Beginning.|  At End.\r\n          --------+-------------+----------\r\n             1    |   120° F.   |   150° F.\r\n             2    |   130° F.   |   160° F.\r\n          3 and 4 |   140° F.   |   180° F.\r\n          --------+-------------+----------\r\n\r\nIn the final draught it is often necessary to use live steam at the\r\nfinish, but this should be avoided if possible.\r\n\r\nThe water contained in wet hide pieces varies from 77 to 90 per cent.\r\nin the different pieces, but in the bulk the average may be taken at 85\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n_Casein._--Casein is the nitrogenous principle of milk, and belongs\r\nto the class of proteids which are definite compounds of oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen, forming the basis of the most important\r\nconstituents of all animal fibres, albumen, casein, and gluten. A very\r\npure form of casein is cheese made from skimmed milk. Casein belongs to\r\nthat class of albumens which are soluble in water, _e.g._, egg albumen,\r\nblood albumen or serum, and lactalbumen, or milk albumen; these are\r\nmostly precipitated from solution by saturation with sodium chloride\r\n(common salt) or magnesium sulphate; but they are all coagulated by\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nBy the action of rennet on milk the proteid or albumen principle is\r\nconverted into a curd (casein). This curd, when freed from fats, is\r\ninsoluble in water, but is soluble in dilute acids, or alkalies,\r\nor alkaline carbonates, from which substances, however, it is\r\nreprecipitated by acidulation. Instead of the above method, casein may\r\nbe precipitated from milk by saturation with sulphate of magnesia, and\r\nwashing the precipitate with a solution of that salt until the washings\r\ncontain no albumen, and then redissolving the prepared casein by\r\nadding water. The salt still adhering to the precipitate enables it to\r\ndissolve. On a large scale the casein is usually prepared by treating\r\nthe milk with acid.\r\n\r\nCasein is readily dissolved by alkalies and alkaline carbonates, borax,\r\nboracic acid solution, caustic soda, and bicarbonate of soda.\r\n\r\n_Starch._--This substance is used in many classes of paper for\r\nimproving the surface and finish. It is added to the pulp in the\r\nbeating engine in the dry form as powder, or in the form of starch\r\npaste, produced by boiling the starch in water.\r\n\r\nThe viscosity of the starch paste is somewhat increased by the addition\r\nof a small quantity of alkali, but due care must be exercised in\r\nboiling, which should only be carried out sufficiently to cause the\r\nstarch granules to burst, as any excessive boiling causes the starch\r\npaste to lose some of its viscosity.\r\n\r\nThe presence of starch in paper is detected by the blue coloration\r\nproduced when the paper is dipped into a weak solution of iodine. The\r\ndetermination of the exact percentage of starch in a paper is a matter\r\nof some difficulty.\r\n\r\n_Silicate of Soda._--The precipitation of gelatinous silica upon the\r\npulp in the beating engine is generally regarded as favourable to the\r\nproduction of a sheet of paper having what is known as a harder finish.\r\nThe precipitation is effected by adding a solution of silicate of soda\r\nto the beating engine, with the subsequent addition of sufficient\r\nsulphate of alumina to react with the silicate of soda.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF COMMERCIAL ALUMS.\r\n\r\n(Griffin and Little.)\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------+------+------+------+------\r\n                                   | (1)  | (2)  | (3)  | (4)\r\n  ---------------------------------+------+------+------+------\r\n  Insoluble in water               |  0·05| 10·61|  0·11|  0·56\r\n  Alumina (Al_{2}O_{3})            | 15·47| 14·96| 11·64| 16·58\r\n  Iron protoxide (FeO)             |  0·02|  0·13|  0·06|   --\r\n  Iron sesquioxide (Fe_{2}O_{3})   |  0·00|  1·08|  1·17|  0·04\r\n  Zinc oxide (ZnO)                 |   -- |   -- |   -- |   --\r\n  Soda (Na_{2}O)                   |  1·72|  0·57|  4·75|  0·56\r\n  Magnesia (MgO)                   |   -- |   -- |  0·45|   --\r\n  Sulphuric acid (SO_{3}) combined | 37·26| 37·36| 35·98| 39·17\r\n  Sulphuric acid (SO_{3}) free     |   -- |  1·08|  5·13|   --\r\n  Water by difference              | 45·48| 34·21| 40·71| 43·09\r\n  ---------------------------------+------+------+------+------\r\n                                   |100·00|100·00|100·00|100·00\r\n  ------------------------------- -+------+------+------+------\r\n  Sizing test (parts of dry neutral|      |      |      |\r\n    rosin size precipitated by one |      |      |      |\r\n    part of the alum)              |  3·32|  3·47|  3·19|  3·71\r\n  ------------------------------- -+------+------+------+------\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING VALUE OF SOLUTIONS OF ALUMINIUM SULPHATE.\r\n\r\n  ---------+------------------------------------------\r\n           |        Pounds per 100 gallons.\r\n           +------------------------------------------\r\n  Twaddell.|Al_{2}O_{3}. | SO_{3}. |Sulphate of\r\n           |                       |Alumina\r\n           |                       |containing 15 per\r\n           |                       |cent.

Various forms are utilised for this purpose, the purest being\r\nsulphate of alumina, required for high grade papers, and the cheaper\r\nform known as alum cake, for news and common printing.\r\n\r\nThe alum is manufactured on a large scale by heating china clay or\r\nbauxite with sulphuric acid. This reaction gives sulphate of alumina\r\ntogether with silica. If the mass is heated to dryness, it is sold\r\nunder the name of _alum cake_. If the mass is extracted with hot water\r\nand the insoluble silica filtered off, the solution can be evaporated\r\ndown for the production of _sulphate of alumina_, which is sold in the\r\nform of large cakes or in the form of crystals.\r\n\r\nBy careful selection of raw material a sulphate of alumina can be\r\nprepared almost entirely free from iron. The presence of the latter is\r\nundesirable, since on exposure to air the sulphate of iron produced\r\nduring the manufacture of the alum is slowly oxidised and turns brown.\r\nUltimately this affects the colour of the finished paper.\r\n\r\nAlum is added to solutions of animal size or gelatine in order to\r\nthicken the solution and render it more viscous. It also acts as a\r\npreservative, and is used for regulating the absorption of the gelatine\r\nby the paper, the penetration effects being materially varied by the\r\nextent to which the alum is utilised.\r\n\r\nIn the process of engine sizing, a term applied to the application of\r\nrosin size on account of the fact that the process is completed in\r\nthe beating engine, alum plays an important part. The mere addition\r\nof the prepared rosin soap to the mixture of pulp and water in the\r\nbeating engine does not size the paper, but the alum precipitates the\r\nrosin from its solution, producing a complex mixture said to consist\r\nof resinate of alumina and free rosin particles, and subsequently the\r\nheat of the paper machine drying cylinders renders the paper more or\r\nless impermeable to moisture.\r\n\r\nThe appearance and tone of paper, more particularly of coloured papers,\r\nare brightened by the use of an excess of alum over and above that\r\nnecessary to precipitate the rosin soap.\r\n\r\n_Rosin Size._--This substance is used chiefly for the sizing of news\r\nand cheap printing papers, and is also employed together with gelatine\r\nfor the commoner writing papers. It is prepared by boiling rosin with\r\ncarbonate of soda under various conditions.\r\n\r\nRosin, sometimes called colophony, is obtained from the sap of certain\r\nfirs and pine trees. This on distillation yields spirits of turpentine,\r\nleaving behind as a residue the mixture of substances to which is given\r\nthe name rosin. It behaves as an acid, and therefore will combine with\r\ncertain alkaline oxides, producing soluble resinates.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the rosin soap used in the paper mill varies according to\r\nthe conditions under which the size is prepared. If a large proportion\r\nof rosin is used, then the size obtained consists of a mixture of\r\nresinate of soda together with free rosin dissolved in the solution. If\r\nthe proportion of rosin is small compared with the amount of carbonate\r\nof soda, the composition of the final mixture is quite different. The\r\ndifference in treatment results in the formation of--\r\n\r\n(_A_) _Neutral Size_, prepared by boiling a known weight of rosin with\r\nsufficient alkali to combine with it and form a neutral resinate of\r\nsoda. Theoretically this may be obtained by using 630 parts of rosin to\r\n100 parts of soda ash. It is doubtful how far the reaction is completed\r\nso as to produce an exactly neutral solution containing only resinate\r\nof soda.\r\n\r\n(_B_) _Acid Size._--When the proportion of rosin is largely increased\r\nthe soda becomes converted into the alkaline resinate, and the excess\r\nof rosin is gradually dissolved in the resinate formed.\r\n\r\nThe practical operations necessary for the preparation of the size are\r\ncomparatively simple. In the case of size containing relatively small\r\npercentages of free rosin, the boiling is conducted in open vessels,\r\nbut for the manufacture of rosin size containing large proportions of\r\nfree rosin boiling under pressure in closed vessels must be resorted to.\r\n\r\nWith the open pan process a steam jacketed pan is used, and the\r\nrequired quantity of alkali, dissolved in water, is placed therein and\r\nheated to boiling point. The rosin well powdered is added in small\r\nquantities from time to time, this being effected cautiously in order\r\nthat the carbonic acid gas set free during the process may readily\r\nescape. The rosin is generally completely saponified after four or five\r\nhours' boiling. It is then passed through strainers into store tanks,\r\nfrom which it is drawn into the beating engines as required.\r\n\r\nIn the case of rosin boiled under pressure a cylindrical vessel\r\nprovided with a manhole at the top is used. The correct amounts of\r\nalkali and water are put into the digester, and also the rosin in a\r\npowdered form, the digester being fitted with a perforated plate placed\r\nabout two feet above the bottom of the vessel in order to prevent the\r\nrosin forming into a hard mass at the bottom of the digester.\r\n\r\nIt is possible in this way to manufacture a thick size containing 30\r\nor 40 per cent. of free rosin and a comparatively small proportion of\r\nwater. Many paper mill firms prefer to purchase such size ready made.\r\n\r\nThe most recent modification of the ordinary rosin size is a compound\r\nprepared by treating rosin with silicate of soda. This alkali dissolves\r\nrosin readily, and the soap obtained when suitably diluted with\r\nwater decomposes in the beating engine on the addition of aluminium\r\nsulphate, with the precipitation of a gelatinous silica which assists\r\nin hardening the paper.\r\n\r\nBacon has patented a process in which powdered rosin is melted down\r\nwith dry crystalline silicate of soda. The resultant product is ground\r\nto a fine powder, which is then ready for use. It dissolves easily in\r\nwater, and when decomposed with the proper proportion of alum gives a\r\ngelatinous viscous mass said to have excellent sizing properties.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of a dry powdered rosin size readily soluble in water\r\nare obvious.\r\n\r\n_Loading._--The term \"loading\" is applied to the various substances\r\nwhich are employed for the purpose, as it is commonly supposed, of\r\nmaking paper heavy. But china clay and similar materials are not added\r\nsimply in order to give weight to the paper, since they serve to\r\nproduce opacity and to improve the surface of papers which could not be\r\nsatisfactorily made unless such materials were used.\r\n\r\n_Examination of Paper for Loading._--If a piece of paper is crumpled\r\nup, placed in a small crucible, and then ignited until all the\r\ncarbonaceous matter has been burnt off, a residue is left in the\r\ncrucible which may be white or coloured. This is usually termed the\r\n_ash_ of the paper. The amount of ash present is determined by taking\r\na weighed quantity of paper and weighing the residue obtained. Special\r\nappliances can be obtained for making rapid determinations of the ash\r\nin paper, but for occasional analyses they are not required.\r\n\r\n_China Clay._--This is the best known and most commonly used loading.\r\nThe purest form of this material is kaolin, a natural substance formed\r\nby the gradual decomposition of felspathic rocks arising from exposure\r\nto the long-continued action of air and water. The clay occurs in great\r\nabundance in Dorset, Cornwall, and Devon, the southern counties in\r\nEngland, where the most famous deposits are found.\r\n\r\nThe natural mineral is levigated with water, and the mixture allowed\r\nto flow through a series of settling ponds, so that the clay gradually\r\nsettles in the form of a fine deposit. The clay is dried and packed\r\nin bags. Its value is controlled largely by the purity of its colour\r\nand its freedom from grit and sand. It is essentially a silicate of\r\nalumina, having the approximate composition--\r\n\r\n        Silica (SiO_{2})          43·00\r\n        Alumina (Al_{2}O_{3})     35·00\r\n        Combined water            10·00\r\n        Moisture and impurities   12·00\r\n                                 ------\r\n                                 100·00\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of the dry substance is 2·50.\r\n\r\nIt is utilised as a loading in all kinds of paper, and forms also the\r\nmain ingredient in the coating found on ordinary art and chromo papers.\r\n\r\n_Ash containing China Clay._--In news, cheap printings, and common art\r\npapers the ash almost invariably contains china clay. This substance is\r\ninsoluble in dilute acids, but is acted upon by concentrated sulphuric\r\nacid when digested for some time. A simple test for the presence of\r\nchina clay in ash is the blue coloration which is obtained when the ash\r\nafter being ignited is gradually heated with a few drops of solution of\r\ncobalt nitrate. China clay can be decomposed by fusion with carbonate\r\nof soda in a crucible. By this means silicate of alumina is decomposed,\r\nand the alumina goes into solution, the silica remaining as an\r\ninsoluble residue. The filtered solution is boiled with an excess of\r\nammonia which gives a gelatinous precipitate of aluminium hydrate.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Lime._--This compound is valued chiefly for its brilliancy\r\nof colour, being used in high-class papers. It is slightly soluble in\r\nwater, to the extent of about 23 lbs. in 1,000 gallons, and this fact\r\nmust be taken into account when the material is added to the pulp in\r\nthe beating engine.\r\n\r\nIt occurs naturally in a variety of forms, such as gypsum, alabaster,\r\nselenite, the first of which when finely powdered is sold to the\r\npaper-maker as gypsum, powdered plaster, and under other fancy names.\r\n\r\nIt can be prepared artificially by adding sulphuric acid to solutions\r\nof calcium salts; and the precipitated product so obtained is sold as\r\nterra alba, pearl hardening, satinite, mineral white, etc.\r\n\r\nThe tests for sulphate of lime in paper ash are based upon the\r\nfollowing reactions:--\r\n\r\nCalcium sulphate is soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid. The addition\r\nof a few drops of barium chloride to the solution produces a dense\r\nheavy precipitate, indicating the sulphate. A small quantity of\r\nammonium oxalate solution added to another portion of the dissolved\r\ncalcium salt previously neutralised with ammonia produces a precipitate\r\nand indicates calcium.\r\n\r\nA microscopic test of paper for the presence of sulphate of lime is\r\nbased upon the slight solubility of the salt in water. The paper is\r\nboiled with some distilled water. The water is evaporated to a small\r\nbulk and transferred to a glass slip, and the gradual formation of\r\ncharacteristic sulphate of lime crystals can be seen by means of the\r\nmicroscope as the water cools down.\r\n\r\n_French Chalk._--This material is prepared by grinding talc into a\r\nfine powder, and possesses a good colour and a somewhat soapy feel. It\r\nis a silicate of magnesia, having the approximate composition--\r\n\r\n    Silica (SiO_{2})          62·00\r\n    Magnesia (MgO)            33·00\r\n    Water                      4·30\r\n    Traces of oxides, etc.     0·70\r\n                             ------\r\n                             100·00\r\n\r\nOther silicates of magnesia used for paper-making are agalite and\r\nasbestine, the latter being a finely ground asbestos.\r\n\r\nThe composition of asbestos is approximately--\r\n\r\n    ---------------------------+----------+-----------\r\n             --                | Italian. | Canadian.\r\n    ---------------------------+----------+-----------\r\n    Lime and magnesia          |   38·0   |   33·0\r\n    Silica                     |   42·0   |   41·0\r\n    Oxides of iron and alumina |    5·0   |   12·0\r\n    Total water                |   13·0   |   12·0\r\n    Traces of soda, etc        |    2·0   |    3·0\r\n                               +----------+-----------\r\n                               |  100·00  |  100·00\r\n    ---------------------------+----------+-----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE PROCESS OF BEATING\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introduction._--The process of beating has for its object the complete\r\nbreaking down of the bleached pulp to the condition of single fibres,\r\nand the further reduction of the fibres, when necessary, into smaller\r\npieces. The disintegration of the material is essential for the\r\nproduction of a close even sheet of paper, and the amount of beating\r\nrequired varies greatly according to the nature of the raw material,\r\nand the class of paper to be produced.\r\n\r\nThe textile trade, on the other hand, depends on a raw material\r\ncomposed of strong fibres, or of filaments characterised by great\r\nlength, and any processes of treatment which tend to reduce the length\r\nof such fibres are carefully avoided, and it is therefore obvious that\r\nfibres which are of no value for textile purposes can be appropriated\r\nfor paper-making.\r\n\r\n_Condition of Fibres._--The great differences in the physical\r\ncharacteristics and structure of the fibres employed for paper-making\r\nsuggest that the possible variations in the final product obtained by\r\nbeating are very numerous. This is a well-known fact, and it is further\r\nto be noted that this mechanical operation brings about not merely\r\nalterations of a physical order, but introduces some interesting and\r\nimportant chemical changes.\r\n\r\nOf the better-known materials linen, with an average fibre length of 28\r\nmm., the structure of which lends itself to considerable alteration by\r\nbeating, is in marked contrast to esparto, the fibre length of which\r\nis only 1·5 mm. If the process of beating a linen rag merely resulted\r\nin the cutting of all the fibres of 28 mm. long into short fragments of\r\n1·5 mm., there would be nothing remarkable in it, but the changes which\r\noccur in reducing the long linen fibre to 1·5 or 2·0 mm. are of a far\r\nmore important character than this.\r\n\r\n_Early Methods._--In the early days of paper-making the disintegration\r\nof the half-stuff was effected by a true \"beating\" process, the rags\r\nbeing subjected to the action of heavy stampers, which broke up the\r\nmass of tangled fibre into a uniform pulp. The fibres for the most part\r\nretained their maximum length in this operation, which was exceedingly\r\nslow and tedious, though at the same time giving a sheet of paper of\r\nremarkable strength.\r\n\r\nThe nearest imitation of these old-time rag papers is to be seen in\r\nthe well-known Japanese papers, which are extraordinarily strong. Some\r\nof these the writer has examined in order to determine the length of\r\nthe fibre. The sheets when held up to the light appear \"cloudy\" and\r\n\"wild\" owing to the presence of the long fibres, which have only been\r\nseparated or teased out by the primitive methods of beating used, and\r\nnot completely disintegrated.\r\n\r\n_Conditions of Beating._--About A.D. 1700 there began a great epoch\r\nin the history of paper-making. With the invention of the Hollander\r\nengine about A.D. 1670, the process of disintegration was greatly\r\nhastened, because it was possible to reduce the half-stuff much more\r\nreadily. The substitution of the idea of plain \"beating\" by a principle\r\nwhich combined the gradual isolation of the individual fibres with a\r\nsplitting up of those fibres lengthwise and crosswise was not only an\r\nadvantage in point of economy of time and cost, but also a material\r\nadvance in the possibilities of greater variations in the finished\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of the process of beating carried out with a Hollander\r\npermit of considerable alteration, so that these changes in the fibre\r\nare not surprising when properly understood. In fact, it is now\r\nconceded that a close study of the theory and practice of beating\r\nis likely to bring about still more remarkable improvements in this\r\nimportant department of the paper-maker's work. The quality and\r\ncharacter of the paper made may be varied with--\r\n\r\n(1) The origin of the raw material, _e.g._, rags, esparto, or wood;\r\n\r\n(2) The condition of the material, _e.g._, old or new rags, green or\r\nmature esparto, mechanical or chemical wood pulp;\r\n\r\n(3) The time occupied in beating, _e.g._, four hours for an ordinary\r\nrag printing and twelve hours for a rag parchment;\r\n\r\n(4) The state of the beater knives, _e.g._, sharp tackle for blottings\r\nand dull tackle for cartridge papers;\r\n\r\n(5) The speed of the beater roll, also its weight;\r\n\r\n(6) The rate at which the beater roll is lowered on to the bedplate;\r\n\r\n(7) The temperature of the contents of the engine.\r\n\r\n_The Beater Roll._--If the beater roll is fitted with sharp knives, and\r\nthis is put down close to the bedplate quickly, the fibres are cut up\r\nshort, and they do not assimilate the water. If the roll is fitted with\r\ndull knives, or \"tackle,\" as it is sometimes called, and it is lowered\r\ngradually, the fibres are drawn and bruised out without being greatly\r\nshortened. In this condition the stuff becomes very \"wet,\" or \"greasy,\"\r\nas it is termed. The cellulose enters into association with water when\r\nbeaten for many hours, and the pulp in the beating engine changes into\r\na curious greasy-like mass of a semi-transparent character. Rag pulp\r\nbeaten for a long time produces a hard, translucent, dense sheet of\r\npaper. Flax thread beaten 48 to 60 hours is used in practice for the\r\nmanufacture of gramophone horns and similar purposes.\r\n\r\nSoft porous papers like blottings, filtering papers, heavy chromos,\r\nlitho papers, antiques, light printings, are made from pulps which are\r\nbeaten quickly with the roll put down close to the bedplate soon after\r\nthe stuff has been filled in.\r\n\r\nWith strong, dense, hard papers, such as parchments, banks,\r\ngreaseproofs and the like, the pulp is beaten slowly and the roll\r\nlowered gradually.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the pulp and the time occupied in beating are also\r\nimportant factors in producing these different papers, three to four\r\nhours being ample for an ordinary wood pulp printing, whereas a wood\r\npulp parchment requires seven to eight hours.\r\n\r\n_Beating Pulps Separately._--The use of esparto and wood pulp in\r\nconjunction with one another, or blended with rag, has introduced new\r\nproblems into the question of beating. Perhaps the most important\r\nof these is the advisability of beating the pulps separately and\r\neventually passing them through a mixer of some kind before discharging\r\ninto a stuff chest. The necessity for differentiating the amount of\r\nbeating is already partly recognised when very dissimilar pulps, such\r\nas strong rag and esparto, are blended, but the whole subject ought to\r\nbe carefully studied by the paper-maker and investigated on its merits\r\nfrom the standpoint of \"beating effects,\" apart from questions of cost\r\nand expediency. The former fully understood and exhaustively examined\r\nby practical tests would of course only be developed if proved to be\r\nadvantageous.\r\n\r\nThe field of research in this direction has not yet been seriously\r\nexplored. With the enormous consumption of wood pulps of varying\r\nquality made from many different species of wood by several processes,\r\nthere is ample room for interesting and profitable enquiry,\r\nparticularly as the types of beating engine are so numerous. The\r\neffects produced by the Hollander, the refiner, the edge runner, the\r\nstone beater roll, and other mechanisms, are all of varying kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF PROLONGED BEATING.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a knowledge of the precise effects produced by the\r\nbeating of pulp cannot be emphasised too much, and any contributions to\r\nthe subject along the lines of special research will be welcomed by all\r\nstudents of cellulose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Cotton Pulp beaten 8 hours.]\r\n\r\nSome experiments were conducted by the writer in 1906 with cotton rags,\r\nin order to determine the results obtained by beating the pulp for a\r\nprolonged period under exact and specific conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Cotton Pulp beaten 37 hours.]\r\n\r\nThe cotton rags, of good quality, were boiled with caustic soda in\r\nthe usual way for six or seven hours, at a pressure of 15 to 20 lbs.,\r\nwashed and partially broken down in the rag breaker, and finally\r\nbleached, made into half-stuff, and then transferred to a Hollander\r\nbeating engine.\r\n\r\nThe particular conditions specified for the beating operation were that\r\nthe beaterman should manipulate the pulp according to his usual routine\r\nfor the manufacture of the paper which he was accustomed to make from\r\nthese rags. In this case the routine process meant beating for eight\r\nhours, by which time the pulp was ready for the paper machine. In the\r\nordinary course the pulp would be discharged into the stuff chest, and\r\nconverted into a strong, thin, bank paper.\r\n\r\nDuring the prolonged beating the pulp became very soft and \"greasy,\"\r\nand when made up into sheets the paper as it dried exhibited remarkable\r\ndifferences in shrinkage, the dry sheets obtained from pulp beaten\r\nthirty-seven hours being much smaller than those obtained from pulp\r\nbeaten only four or six hours. The actual shrinkage is shown in the\r\nfollowing table:--\r\n\r\n    ------+---------------+----------------+--------------+----------\r\n          |               |                |   Relative   |\r\n    Hours.| Area of Sheet.|  Loss of Area. |    Areas.    |Shrinkage\r\n          |    Sq. mm.    |    Sq. mm.     |  Deckle 100  |per cent.\r\n    ------+---------------+----------------+--------------+----------\r\n      0   |   26,384·0    |         --     |    100·0     |   --\r\n      4   |   26,076·0    |       308·0    |     98·9     |   1·1\r\n      6   |   25,520·1    |       863·9    |     96·7     |   3·3\r\n      8   |   25,160·0    |     1,224·0    |     95·4     |   4·6\r\n     10   |   24,794·8    |     1,589·2    |     93·9     |   6·1\r\n     13   |   24,467·4    |     1,916·6    |     92·8     |   7·2\r\n     15   |   24,215·2    |     2,168·8    |     91·8     |   8·2\r\n     17   |   24,024·0    |     2,360·0    |     90·9     |   9·1\r\n     19   |   23,616·2    |     2,767·8    |     89·6     |  10·4\r\n     21   |   23,616·0    |     2,768·0    |     89·6     |  10·4\r\n     23   |   23,535·7    |     2,848·3    |     89·3     |  10·7\r\n     25   |   23,329·9    |     3,054·1    |     88·5     |  11·5\r\n     27   |   22,920·5    |     3,463·5    |     86·9     |  13·1\r\n     29   |   22,831·2    |     3,552·8    |     86·5     |  13·5\r\n     31   |   22,492·9    |     3,891·1    |     85·3     |  14·7\r\n     33   |   21,917·2    |     4,466·8    |     83·1     |  16·9\r\n     35   |   21,226·1    |     5,157·9    |     80·5     |  19·5\r\n     37   |   20,778·8    |     5,605·2    |     78·8     |  21·2\r\n    ------+---------------+----------------+--------------+----------\r\n\r\nIf these results are plotted in the form of a curve the relation\r\nbetween the period of beating and the shrinkage in area is clearly\r\nshown. For the first twenty hours the shrinkage is proportional to the\r\nperiod of beating, after which the curve assumes an irregular shape,\r\nshowing a tendency for shrinkage to proceed at a faster rate.\r\n\r\n_Weight and Substance of the Paper._--The shrinkage of the paper after\r\nprolonged beating indicates a closer and denser sheet, so that for\r\npapers of equal thickness the weight per unit area was much greater in\r\nthe case of the pulp beaten for the full period. The results obtained\r\nare very interesting, and the following summary for a few of the\r\nreadings obtained will serve to show the alteration effected.\r\n\r\n  ----------+--------------+--------------+------------+---------------\r\n            |  Weight of   | Thickness of | Grams per  | Lbs. per ream\r\n  Hours.    |20,000 sq. mm.|    Sheet.    | sq. metre. | 480 sheets,\r\n            |  Grams.      |     mm.      |            |   20\" × 30\".\r\n  ----------+--------------+--------------+------------+---------------\r\n   Class A  |              |              |            |\r\n  8-10 hrs. |    1·875     |     ·183     |    93·75   |   38·23\r\n            |              |              |            |\r\n   Class B  |              |              |            |\r\n  19-21 hrs.|    2·043     |     ·189     |   102·15   |   41·65\r\n            |              |              |            |\r\n   Class C  |              |              |            |\r\n  33-35 hrs.|    2·203     |     ·189     |   110·15   |   44·93\r\n  ----------+--------------+--------------+------------+--------------\r\n\r\n_Sizing and Glazing Effects._--The behaviour of the waterleaf paper\r\nafter sizing and glazing gave some interesting results. In the first\r\nplace, the effect of the altered density of the paper is strikingly\r\nshown by the amount of the size absorbed. Certain selected sheets\r\nwere passed through a solution of ordinary gelatine in the usual way,\r\nand subsequently dried. The amount of gelatine absorbed differs in a\r\nremarkable degree, as shown in table.\r\n\r\n_Tensile Strength of the Paper._--It is interesting to note that the\r\ntensile strength of the waterleaf papers appears to remain fairly\r\nconstant throughout the whole period of beating. But this uniformity is\r\ngreatly altered by the operations of sizing and glazing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCENTAGE OF AIR-DRY GELATINE ABSORBED BY THE WATERLEAF SHEETS.\r\n\r\n    ----------+-----------------------------------+---------\r\n              |   Percentage of Size absorbed.    |\r\n      Hours.  +-----------+-----------+-----------+  Mean.\r\n              | 1st Trial.| 2nd Trial.| 3rd Trial.|\r\n    ----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+---------\r\n        8     |    5·5    |    6·0    |    6·2    |   5·9\r\n       10     |    5·4    |    6·8    |    6·5    |   6·2\r\n       19     |    3·8    |    5·0    |    4·5    |   4·4\r\n       21     |    4·8    |    3·9    |    4·6    |   4·4\r\n       33     |    2·7    |    1·7    |    2·4    |   2·3\r\n       35     |    2·4    |    1·9    |    1·7    |   2·0\r\n    ----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+---------\r\n\r\nThese results are rather remarkable. The prolonged beating does not\r\nseem to have affected the tensile strength of the waterleaf, and the\r\npractical loss of strength which actually occurs in the more completely\r\nfinished paper does not manifest itself until after the sizing process.\r\nThe importance of the gelatine as a factor in the ultimate strength is\r\nthus clearly and strikingly demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTS FOR STRENGTH ON ORIGINAL WATERLEAF PAPER.\r\n\r\n        --------------+--------------+--------------\r\n                      |Mean result of|Mean Strength\r\n           Hours.     |  Readings.   |of the Paper.\r\n                      |    Lbs.      |   Lbs.\r\n        --------------+--------------+--------------\r\n             8        |   a  14·1    |    12·1\r\n                      |   b  10·1    |\r\n            10        |   a  15·4    |    13·2\r\n                      |   b  10·9    |\r\n            19        |   a  16·5    |    14·0\r\n                      |   b  11·4    |\r\n            21        |   a  15·2    |    14·0\r\n                      |   b  12·8    |\r\n            33        |   a  13·4    |    12·4\r\n                      |   b  11·4    |\r\n            35        |   a  14·5    |    13·6\r\n                      |   b  12·7    |\r\n        --------------+--------------+--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTS FOR STRENGTH ON PAPERS, SIZED ONLY.\r\n\r\n        --------------+--------------+--------------\r\n                      |Mean result of|Mean Strength\r\n           Hours.     |  Readings.   |of the Paper.\r\n                      |    Lbs.      |   Lbs.\r\n        --------------+--------------+--------------\r\n             8        |   a  22·7    |    20·0\r\n                      |   b  17·3    |\r\n            10        |   a  28·5    |    23·2\r\n                      |   b  18·0    |\r\n            19        |   a  22·5    |    21·0\r\n                      |   b  19·5    |\r\n            21        |   a  26·0    |    21·7\r\n                      |   b  17·5    |\r\n            33        |   a  15·0    |    15·0\r\n                      |   b  15·0    |\r\n            35        |   a  14·2    |    15·3\r\n                      |   b  16·5    |\r\n        --------------+--------------+--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTS FOR STRENGTH ON PAPER SIZED AND GLAZED.\r\n\r\n        --------------+--------------+--------------\r\n                      |Mean result of|Mean Strength\r\n           Hours.     |  Readings.   |of the Paper.\r\n                      |    Lbs.      |   Lbs.\r\n        --------------+--------------+--------------\r\n             8        |  a  25·8     |    23·6\r\n                      |  b  21·4     |\r\n            10        |  a  28·4     |    23·6\r\n                      |  b  18·9     |\r\n            19        |  a  27·0     |    22·9\r\n                      |  b  18·9     |\r\n            21        |  a  24·9     |    22·7\r\n                      |  b  20·6     |\r\n            33        |  a  16·1     |    15·2\r\n                      |  b  14·4     |\r\n            35        |  a  17·5     |    16·2\r\n                      |  b  15·0     |\r\n        --------------+--------------+--------------\r\n\r\nIt may also be noticed that the strength of the finished paper after\r\ntwenty hours' beating, as in class B, is equal to that of the paper\r\nafter nine hours' beating, as in class A. This is curious, especially\r\nin view of the fact that the percentage of gelatine in the papers of\r\nclass B. is only 4·4 per cent. as against 6·0 per cent. in class A.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the percentage of gelatine to the period of beating\r\nthus becomes a matter of interest, and well worth investigation. The\r\nfigures are suggestive of further experimental research along definite\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Plan and Sectional Elevation of a \"Hollander.\"]\r\n\r\n_Developments in Beating Engines._--Since the introduction of the\r\nHollander beating engine, about A.D. 1670, other types of beater almost\r\ntoo numerous to mention have been devised to supersede it, but the fact\r\nremains that the principle of the original Hollander and its general\r\ndesign are still adhered to in the engines used by paper-makers for\r\nhigh-class work.\r\n\r\nThe alterations and improvements which have taken place during the\r\nlast fifty years relate chiefly to the modifications naturally arising\r\nfrom the introduction of fibres not requiring such drastic treatment as\r\nrags.\r\n\r\nThe machines now in use for reducing half-stuff to beaten pulp ready\r\nfor the paper machine may be classified as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Beaters of the Hollander type, in which the circulation of the pulp\r\nin the engine and the actual beating process are both effected by the\r\nbeater roll.\r\n\r\n(2) Beaters of the circulator type, in which the movement of the pulp\r\nis maintained by a special contrivance, and the beater roll used only\r\nfor beating.\r\n\r\n(3) Beaters of the stone roll type in which the roll and bedplate are\r\neither or both composed of stone, granite, or similar non-metallic\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n(4) Refiners, containing conical shaped beater rolls working in a\r\nconical shell fitted with stationary knives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Beating Engine with Four Beater Rolls.]\r\n\r\n_The Hollander._--This beating engine in its simplest form consists of\r\nan oval shaped trough, divided into two channels by a \"midfeather,\"\r\nwhich does not, however, reach completely from one end to the other.\r\n\r\nIn one of the channels the bed of the trough slopes up slightly to the\r\nplace where the \"bedplate\" is fixed. The bedplate consists of a number\r\nof stout metal bars or knives firmly fastened into an iron frame, which\r\nlies across this channel. The beater roll, a heavy cast-iron roll\r\nprovided with projecting knives or blades arranged in clumps of three\r\naround the circumference, and supported on bearings at each side of the\r\nengine, revolves above the bedplate with the knives adjusted to any\r\nrequired distance from it, the raising or lowering of the beater roll\r\nfor this purpose being effected by the use of adjustable bearings.\r\n\r\nThe bed of the trough behind the beater roll rises sharply up from the\r\nbedplate and then falls away suddenly, as shown in the diagram, forming\r\nthe \"backfall.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the engine is in operation the mixture of water and pulp is drawn\r\nbetween the knives and circulated round the trough. The material is\r\ndisintegrated into fibres of the required condition, discharged over\r\nthe backfall, and kept in a state of continual circulation, and the\r\nbeating maintained until the stuff has been sufficiently treated.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the engine vary according to the capacity, which is\r\nusually expressed in terms of the amount of dry pulp the beater will\r\nhold, and the following figures may be taken as giving the average\r\nsizes:--\r\n\r\n        -----------------+----------------+----------------\r\n                --       | 2 cwt. Engine. | 5 cwt. Engine.\r\n        -----------------+----------------|----------------\r\n        Length           |  11 ft. 0 in.  |  16 ft. 0 in.\r\n        Width            |   5 ft. 6 in.  |   8 ft. 0 in.\r\n        Depth (average)  |   2 ft. 3 in.  |   2 ft. 9 in.\r\n        Diameter of roll |   3 ft. 6 in.  |   3 ft. 6 in.\r\n        -----------------+----------------+----------------\r\n\r\nSundry modifications in the form and arrangement of the beater\r\nhave been tried from time to time. In 1869 Granville patented the\r\nsubstitution of a second beater roll in place of the stationary\r\nbedplate for the purpose of hastening the operation. Repeated attempts\r\nhave been made to construct a beating engine with two or more rolls,\r\nbut it is evident that such a device could hardly succeed, since it\r\nwould be impossible to ensure proper adjustment of the rolls, and in\r\nthat case one roll might be doing all the work.\r\n\r\nThe first machine of this type was patented in 1872 by Salt. Similar\r\nbeaters were devised by Forbes in 1880, Macfarlane in 1886, Pickles in\r\n1894, who proposed to use three rolls, and Partington in 1901. Hoffman\r\ndescribes a beating engine which was working in America containing four\r\nrolls, as shown in the diagram.\r\n\r\n_The Umpherston._--A notable modification of the Hollander, having\r\nan arrangement by which the two channels of the engines are placed\r\nunder one another, and one which is largely used for fibres, is the\r\nUmpherston. Several engines differing in detail, but embodying the same\r\nprinciple, have been built in imitation of this one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Umpherston Beater.]\r\n\r\nBedplates of large working surface were first tried in England by Cooke\r\nand Hibbert, in 1878, but in practice it has been found that no serious\r\ndeviations from the narrow type of plate are of much value. As a matter\r\nof fact it is held by some paper-makers that one or two knives would\r\nbe sufficient if they could be relied on to keep true and in proper\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\n_The Circulating Type of Beater._--The addition of some device for\r\nkeeping the pulp in circulation apart from the action of the roll\r\nhas received considerable attention. The early experiments in this\r\ndirection with the Hollander led ultimately to the construction of the\r\nengine of the circulator type mentioned in class 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Section of Umpherston Beating Engine.]\r\n\r\nThus, in 1872, Nugent patented a special paddle to be used in the\r\nHollander, by which the pulp in the trough of the beater was impelled\r\ntowards the roll. Many other plans were tried for this purpose, and\r\ndetails can be seen in the List of Patents (see page 192).\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the beaters with special means of circulating the\r\npulp was found to be of the greatest service in the treatment of stuff\r\nlike esparto and wood pulp, since these materials did not require the\r\ndrastic measures necessary with rag pulp. In 1890 several engines of\r\nthis class were being adopted, amongst which may be mentioned Hemmer's,\r\nReed's and Taylor's. The pulp discharged from the beater roll was drawn\r\nthrough an independent pipe or channel by means of an Archimedean\r\nscrew, or a centrifugal pump.\r\n\r\n_Stone Beater Rolls._--The substitution of stone for metal in the roll\r\nand bedplate of the engine brings about some remarkable changes in the\r\nnature of the beaten stuff. The fibre is submitted to the action of\r\nrough surfaces rather than that due to the contact of sharp edges, with\r\nthe result that the disintegration is much more rapid, and produces\r\na \"wet\" working pulp suitable for imitation parchments and similar\r\npapers. The latest materials used for this purpose are basalt lava\r\nstone in Germany, and carborundum in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Nugent's Beating Engine with Paddles for\r\nCirculating the Pulp.]\r\n\r\nCare is necessary in the manipulation of these beaters to prevent\r\nfracture of the stone parts. In the Wagg Jordan engine this danger is\r\nmaterially reduced by the construction of the working parts.\r\n\r\n_Refiners._--In these engines the beater roll is a conical shaped drum\r\ncarrying the knives, which revolve inside a conical shell completely\r\nlined with fixed knives. The fibres are thus cut up to the desired\r\nlength, but before discharge from the engine they pass between two\r\ncircular discs, one stationary and the other revolving in a vertical\r\nposition. The effect of the discs is to tear or bruise the fibres\r\nrather than to cut them.\r\n\r\nThe refiner is best employed to clear or brush out the mass of pulp\r\nafter a certain amount of preliminary treatment in the beater, as the\r\nrefiner cannot produce the effects obtained by actual beating as in the\r\nHollander.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--A \"Tower\" Beating Engine with Centrifugal Pump\r\nfor Circulating Pulp.]\r\n\r\n_Power Consumption._--The long treatment required to thoroughly pulp\r\na strong material demands a great amount of power. Engines differ\r\nconsiderably in their power consumption, and comparisons are frequently\r\nmade in terms of the power required to beat a given weight of pulp.\r\nBut this is not always a true criterion of efficient work. Some types\r\nof beater are suitable for producing certain results, and the mere\r\nsubstitution of a beater consuming less power is worse than useless\r\nunless it can be shown that the same effects are being obtained. The\r\nefficiency of the Hollander for the beating of rag pulp, in spite of\r\nthe high power consumption, is a case in point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Working Parts of a Modern Refining Engine.]\r\n\r\nWith this factor properly considered, the power required for beating\r\nbecomes an interesting study.

With the ordinary writing\r\nand printing papers the process is usually confined to the addition of\r\nsmall quantities of pigments or soluble colours sufficient to _tone_\r\nthe pulp and correct the yellow tint which the raw material possesses\r\neven after bleaching. In the case of cover papers, tissues, and similar\r\ncoloured papers, the process is one of dyeing as it is generally\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe colouring matters which have been employed by the paper-maker are--\r\n\r\n\r\nPIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n(A) Added to the pulp in the form of mineral in a finely divided state.\r\n\r\n  _Yellow._--This colour is obtained by the use of _ochres_, which are\r\n    natural earth colours of varying shades, from bright yellow to\r\n    brown.\r\n\r\n  _Red._--Ordinary red lead.\r\n\r\n    Various oxides of iron, such as Indian red, Venetian red, red\r\n      ochre, rouge.\r\n\r\n  _Blue._--_Smalts_--An expensive pigment prepared by grinding cobalt\r\n    glass.\r\n\r\n    _Ultramarine_--A substance of complex composition prepared by\r\n      heating a mixture of china clay, carbonate of soda, sulphate\r\n      of soda, sulphur, charcoal, and sometimes quartz, rosin and\r\n      infusorial earth.\r\n\r\n    _Prussian Blue_--A compound prepared by adding potassium\r\n      ferrocyanide to a solution of ferrous sulphate.\r\n\r\n  _Brown._--Natural earth colours, such as sienna, umber, Vandyke brown.\r\n\r\n  _Black._--Lamp-black, bone-black, Frankfort black.\r\n\r\n(B) Produced by the reaction of soluble salts upon one another when\r\nadded to the pulp in the beating engine.\r\n\r\n  _Yellow._--_Chrome Yellow_--The paper pulp is first impregnated with\r\n    acetate of lead, and potassium or sodium bichromate added. This\r\n    precipitates the chromate of lead as a yellow pigment.\r\n\r\n    _Chrome Orange_--The addition of caustic alkali to the bichromate\r\n      solution converts the chrome yellow into an orange.\r\n\r\n  _Blue.--Prussian Blue_--The paper pulp impregnated with iron salts\r\n    is treated with potassium ferrocyanide. The blue colour is at once\r\n    obtained.\r\n\r\n  _Brown.--Iron Buff_--A light yellow-brown colour due to the\r\n    precipitation of ferrous sulphate by means of an alkali.\r\n\r\n  _Bronze._--Manganese chloride followed by caustic soda.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLUBLE COLOURS.\r\n\r\n(A) Natural Dyes. These colouring matters are now seldom used.\r\n\r\n  _Yellow and Brown._--The vegetable extracts, such as fustic,\r\n    quercitron, cutch, turmeric, have practically all been replaced by\r\n    aniline colours.\r\n\r\n  _Red._--Madder (Turkey red), Brazilwood, cochineal (a dye obtained\r\n    from dried cochineal insects). Safflower.\r\n\r\n  _Black_.--Logwood, used in conjunction with an iron salt. Cutch, used\r\n    with an iron salt.\r\n\r\n(B) Coal Tar Dyes. The dyeing and colouring of paper pulp by means of\r\nthe artificial organic substances has become a matter of daily routine,\r\nthe expensive natural dyes and the ordinary pigments having been almost\r\ncompletely superseded. The numerous colouring matters available may be\r\nclassified either by reference to their chemical constitution or simply\r\non general lines, having regard to certain broad distinctions.\r\n\r\nIf the latter classification is taken, then the dyes familiar to the\r\npaper-maker may be divided into--\r\n\r\n  (a) Acid dyes, so called because the full effect of the colouring\r\n    matter is best obtained in a bath showing an acid reaction.\r\n\r\n  (b) Basic dyes, so called because the colour is best developed in an\r\n    alkaline solution, without any excess of mordant.\r\n\r\n  (c) Substantive dyes, which do not require the use of a mordant, as\r\n    the colour is fixed by the fibre without such reagents.\r\n\r\nSome of the most frequently used colouring matters are shown in the\r\naccompanying table on page 202.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between _acid_ and _basic_ dye-stuffs is largely due\r\nto certain characteristics possessed by many of them. Thus magenta,\r\nwhich is the salt of the base known as Rosaniline, belonging to the\r\nbasic colouring matters, a group of dyes which do not possess the\r\nfastness of colour peculiar to acid dyes, has a limited application.\r\nBut by treatment with sulphuric acid magenta is converted into an\r\nacid magenta, and this dye has wider application than the basic salt.\r\nSimilarly the basic dye called aniline blue is insoluble in water,\r\nand therefore has only a limited use, but by treatment with sulphuric\r\nacid it is converted into alkali blue, soluble blue and so on, which\r\ndissolve readily in water and are good fast colours. The acid dyes\r\ngenerally have a weaker colouring power than the basic dyes, but they\r\nproduce very even shades.\r\n\r\n  -------+-------------------+-----------------+-----------------\r\n  Colour.|      Acid.        |     Basic.      |  Substantive.\r\n  -------+-------------------+-----------------+-----------------\r\n  Yellow | Metanil yellow.   | Auramine.       | Cotton yellow.\r\n  and    | Paper yellow.     | Chrysoidine.    | Chrysophenine.\r\n  Orange.| Orange II.        |                 |\r\n         | Naphthol yellow S.|                 |\r\n         | Quinoline yellow. |                 |\r\n         |                   |                 |\r\n  Red.   | Fast red A.       | Rhodamine.      | Congo red.\r\n         | Cotton scarlet.   | Paper scarlet.  | Benzopurpurin.\r\n         | Erythrine.        | Safranine.      | Oxamine red.\r\n         | Ponceau.          | Magenta.        |\r\n         |                   |                 |\r\n  Blue   | Water blue 1 N.   | Methylene blue. | Azo blue.\r\n  and    | Fast blue.        | Victoria blue.  |\r\n  Violet.| Acid violet.      | New blue.       |\r\n         |                   | Indoine blue.   |\r\n         |                   | Methyl violet.  |\r\n         |                   | Crystal violet. |\r\n         |                   |                 |\r\n  Brown  | Naphthylamine     | Bismarck brown. |\r\n         |   brown.          | Vesuvine.       |\r\n         |                   |                 |\r\n  Black  | Nigrosine.        | Coal Black B.   |\r\n         | Brilliant black B.|                 |\r\n         |                   |                 |\r\n  Green  |                   | Diamond green.  |\r\n         |                   | Malachite green.|\r\n  -------+-------------------+-----------------+-----------------\r\n\r\nThe difference in the composition of the basic and acid dyes is\r\ntaken advantage of in the dyeing of paper pulp to secure a complete\r\ndistribution of the colouring matter upon the pulp, with the result\r\nthat the intensity of colour is increased, its fastness strengthened,\r\nand the process of dyeing generally rendered more economical. This is\r\neffected by the judicious addition of a suitable acid dye to the pulp\r\nalready coloured with the basic dye.\r\n\r\nThe direct colouring matters have but a very limited application for\r\npaper dyeing owing to their sensitiveness to acids and alkalies.\r\n\r\nIn the colouring of paper pulp, attention is given to many important\r\ndetails, such as:--\r\n\r\n_Fading of Colour._--Some loss of colour almost invariably occurs even\r\nwith dyes generally looked upon as fast to light. The shade or tint of\r\nthe paper is affected not only by exposure to light, but by contact of\r\nthe coloured paper with common boards on which it is often pasted. The\r\nalkalinity of straw boards, for example, is frequently one source of\r\nserious alteration of colour, and the acidity of badly made pastes and\r\nadhesives another.\r\n\r\nIn all such cases, the dyes must be carefully selected in order to\r\nobtain a coloured paper which will show a minimum alteration in tint\r\nby exposure to light or by contact with chemical substances. This is\r\nparticularly necessary in coloured wrapping paper used for soap, tea,\r\ncotton yarn, and similar goods.\r\n\r\n_Unevenness of Colour._--The different affinity of the various\r\npaper-making fibres for dyes is apt to produce an uneven colour in the\r\nfinished paper. This is very noticeable in mixtures of chemical wood\r\npulp or cellulose and mechanical wood pulp. The ligno-cellulose of\r\nthe latter has a great affinity for basic dyes, and if the required\r\namount of dye is added to a beater containing the mixed pulps in\r\nan insufficiently diluted form, the mechanical wood pulp becomes\r\nmore deeply coloured than the cellulose. If the former is a finely\r\nground pulp, the effect is not very noticeable, but if it is coarse,\r\ncontaining a large number of coarse fibres, then the paper appears\r\nmottled. The defect is still further aggravated when the paper is\r\ncalendered, especially if calendered in a damp condition. In that case\r\nthe strongly coloured fibres of mechanical wood are very prominent.\r\n\r\nWhen dyes have been carelessly dissolved and added to the beating\r\nengine without being properly strained, unevenness of colour may often\r\nbe traced to the presence of undissolved particles of dye.\r\n\r\n_Irregular Colour of the two Sides._--Many papers exhibit a marked\r\ndifference in the colour of the two sides. When heavy pigments are\r\nemployed as the colouring medium, the under side of the sheet, that is,\r\nthe side of the paper in contact with the machine wire, is often darker\r\nthan the top side. The suction of the vacuum boxes is the main cause\r\nof this defect, though the amount of water flowing on to the wire, the\r\n\"shake\" of the wire, and the extent to which the paper is sized are all\r\ncontributory causes. By careful regulation of these varying conditions\r\nthe trouble is considerably minimised.\r\n\r\nThe under surface of the paper is not invariably darker than the top\r\nsurface. With pigments of less specific gravity the reverse is found to\r\nbe the case. This is probably to be explained by the fact that some of\r\nthe colouring matter from the under side is drawn away from the paper\r\nby the suction boxes, and the pigment on the top side is not drawn away\r\nto any serious extent, because the layer of pulp below it acts as a\r\nfilter and promotes a retention of colour on the top side.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that this irregularity sometimes occurs\r\nwith soluble dyes, as for example in the case of auramine. The\r\ndecomposition of this dye when heated to the temperature of boiling\r\nwater is well known, and the contact of a damp sheet of paper coloured\r\nby auramine with the surfaces of steam-heated cylinders at a high\r\ntemperature brings about a partial decomposition of the dye on one side\r\nof the paper. Generally speaking, acid dyes are more sensitive to heat\r\nthan basic dyes.\r\n\r\nThe presence of china clay in a coloured paper is also an explanation\r\nof this irregular appearance of the two sides. China clay readily forms\r\nan insoluble lake with basic dyes, and when the suction boxes on the\r\nmachine are worked with a high vacuum the paper is apt to be more\r\ndeeply coloured one side than another.\r\n\r\n_The Machine Backwater._--Economy in the use of dyes to avoid a loss\r\nof the colouring matter in the \"backwater,\" or waste water from the\r\npaper machine, is only obtained by careful attention to details of\r\nmanufacture on the one hand and by a knowledge of the chemistry of\r\ndyeing on the other. The loss is partly avoided by regulating the\r\namount of water used on the machine, so that very little actually goes\r\nto waste, and further reduced by ensuring as complete a precipitation\r\nof the soluble dye as possible.\r\n\r\nThe _acid_ dyes generally do not give a colourless backwater, and all\r\npulps require to be heavily sized when acid dyes are used.\r\n\r\nThe _basic_ dyes are more readily precipitated than the acid dyes,\r\nparticularly if a suitable mordant is used, even with heavily coloured\r\npapers. The addition of an acid dye to pulp first coloured with a basic\r\ndye is frequently resorted to as a means of more complete precipitation.\r\n\r\n_Dyeing to Sample._--The matching of colours has been greatly\r\nsimplified through the publication of pattern books by the firms who\r\nmanufacture dyes, in which books full details as to the composition\r\nof the paper, the proportion of colour and the conditions for maximum\r\neffects are fully set out. The precise results obtained by treating\r\npaper pulp with definite proportions of a certain dye, or a mixture\r\nof several dyes, is determined by experimental trials. A definite\r\nquantity of moist partially beaten and sized pulp, containing a known\r\nweight of air-dry fibre, is mixed with a suitable volume of water at a\r\ntemperature of 80° to 90° F. and the dye-stuff added from a burette in\r\nthe form of a 1 per cent. solution. If preferred a measured volume of\r\na 1 per cent. solution of the dye can be placed in a mortar, and the\r\nmoist pulp, previously squeezed out by hand, added gradually and well\r\ntriturated with the pestle.\r\n\r\nThe dyed mixture is then suitably diluted with water, made up into\r\nsmall sheets of paper on a hand mould or a siphon mould, and dried.\r\n\r\nThe effect of small additions of colour to the contents of a beating\r\nengine is frequently examined in a rough and ready way by the\r\nbeaterman, who pours a small quantity of the diluted pulp on the edge\r\nof the machine wire while the machine is running. This gives a little\r\nrough sheet of paper very quickly.\r\n\r\nThe comparison of the colour of a beaterfull of pulp with the sample\r\npaper which it is desired to match is also effected by reducing a\r\nportion of the paper to the condition of pulp, so that a handful of the\r\nlatter can be compared with a quantity of pulp from the engine. This is\r\nnot always a reliable process, especially with papers coloured by dyes\r\nwhich are sensitive to the heat of the paper machine drying cylinders.\r\n\r\n_Detection of Colours in Papers._--The examination of coloured papers\r\nfor the purpose of determining what dyes have been employed is a\r\ndifficult task. With white papers which have been merely toned the\r\nproportion of dye is exceedingly small, and a large bulk of paper has\r\nto be treated with suitable solvents in order to obtain an extract\r\ncontaining sufficient dye for investigation.\r\n\r\nWith coloured papers dyed by means of pigments, the colour of the\r\nash left on ignition is some guide to the substance used, a red ash\r\nindicating iron oxide, a yellow ash chromate of lead, and so on.\r\n\r\nWith papers dyed by means of coal tar colours the nature of the\r\ncolouring matter may be determined by the methods of analysis employed\r\nfor the examination of textile fibres.\r\n\r\nThe following hints given by Kollmann will be found useful:--\r\n\r\nTear up small about 100 grammes of paper, and boil it in alcohol, in\r\na flask or a reflux condenser. This must be done before the stripping\r\nwith water, so as to extract the size which would otherwise protect\r\nthe dye from the water. Of course the alcohol treatment is omitted\r\nwith unsized paper. The paper is now boiled with from three to five\r\nlots of water, taking each time only just enough to cover the paper.\r\nThis is done in the same flask after pouring off any alcohol that\r\nmay have been used, and also with the reflux condenser. The watery\r\nextract is mixed with the alcohol extract (if any). Three cases may\r\noccur:--(1) The dye is entirely stripped, or very nearly so. (2) The\r\ndye is partly stripped, what remains on the fibres showing the same\r\ncolour as at first or not. (3) The dye is not stripped. To make sure\r\nof this the solution is filtered, as the presence in it of minute\r\nfragments of fibre deceive the eye as to the stripping action. In the\r\nfirst two cases the mixed solutions are evaporated down to one half on\r\nthe water bath, filtered, evaporated further, and then precipitated by\r\nsaturating it with common salt. The dye is thrown out at once, or after\r\na time. It may precipitate slowly without any salt. The precipitated\r\ndye is filtered off and dried. To see whether it is a single dye or a\r\nmixture, make a not too dark solution of a little of it in water, and\r\nhang up a strip of filter paper so that it is partly immersed in the\r\nsolution. If the latter contains more than one dye they will usually\r\nbe absorbed to different heights, so that the strip will show bands of\r\ndifferent colours crossing it. If it is found that there is only one\r\ndye, dissolve some of it in as little water as possible, and mix it\r\nwith \"tannin-reagent,\" which is made by dissolving equal weights of\r\ntannin and sodium acetate in ten times the weight of either of water.\r\nIf there is a precipitate there is a basic dye, if not, an acid dye.\r\nIn the former case mix the strong solution of the dye with concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid and zinc dust, and boil till the colour is destroyed.\r\nThen neutralise exactly with caustic soda, filter, and put a drop of\r\nthe filtrate on to white filter paper. If the original colour soon\r\nreappears on drying, we draw the following conclusions:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) The colour is red; the dye is an oxazine, thiazine, azine, or\r\nacridine dye, _e.g._, safranine. (_b_) It is orange or yellow; the dye\r\nis as in (_a_), _e.g._, phosphine. (_c_) It is green; the dye is as in\r\n(_a_), _e.g._, azine green. (_d_) It is blue; the dye is as in (_a_),\r\n_e.g._, Nile blue, new blue, fast blue, or methylene blue. (_e_) It\r\nis violet; the dye is as in (_a_), _e.g._, mauveine. If the original\r\ncolour does not reappear on drying, but does so if padded with a 1 per\r\ncent. solution of chromic acid, we draw the following conclusions:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) The colour is red; the dye is rhodamine or fuchsine, or one of\r\ntheir allies. (_b_) It is green; the dye is malachite green, brilliant\r\ngreen, or one of their allies. (_c_) It is blue; the dye is night blue,\r\nVictoria blue, or one of their allies. (_d_) It is violet; the dye is\r\nmethyl violet, crystal violet, or one of their allies.\r\n\r\nIf the original colour does not reappear even with chromic acid, it was\r\nin most cases a yellow or a brown, referable to auramine, chrysoidine,\r\nBismarck brown, thioflavine, or one of their allies.\r\n\r\nIf the tannin reagent produces no precipitate, reduce with hydrochloric\r\nacid and zinc, or ammonia and zinc, and neutralise and filter as in the\r\ncase of a basic dye. The solution when dropped on to white filter paper\r\nmay be bleached (_a_), may have become a brownish red (_b_), may have\r\nbeen imperfectly and slowly bleached (_c_), or may have undergone no\r\nchange (_d_).\r\n\r\n(_a_) If the colour quickly returns the dye is azurine,\r\nindigo-carmine, nigrosine, or one of their allies. If it returns only\r\non padding with a 1 per cent. solution of chromic acid, warming, and\r\nholding over ammonia, some of the dye is dissolved in water mixed\r\nwith concentrated hydrochloric acid, and shaken up with ether. If the\r\nether takes up the dye, we have aurine, eosine, erythrine, phloxine,\r\nerythrosine, or one of their allies. If it does not, we have acid\r\nfuchsine, acid green, fast green, water blue, patent blue, or one\r\nof their allies. If the colour never returns, heat some of the dye\r\non platinum foil. If it deflagrates with coloured fumes, the dye is\r\naurantia, naphthol yellow S., brilliant yellow, or one of their allies.\r\nIf it does not deflagrate, or very slightly, dissolve a little of the\r\ndye in one hundred times its weight of water, and dye a cotton skein\r\nin it at the boil for about fifteen minutes. Then rinse and soap the\r\nskein vigorously. If the dyeing is fast with this treatment we have a\r\nsubstantive cotton yellow or thiazine red; if it is not, we have an\r\nordinary azo dye. (_b_) The dye is an oxyketone, such as alizarine.\r\n(_c_) The dye is thiazol yellow, or one of its allies. (_d_) The dye is\r\nthioflavine S., quinoline yellow, or one of their allies.\r\n\r\nIf the dye is not stripped by alcohol and water, it is either inorganic\r\nor an adjective dye, such as logwood black, cutch, fustic, etc.; and we\r\nproceed according to the colour as follows:--\r\n\r\nIf it is red or brown, the dyed fibre is dried and divided into two\r\nparts. One is boiled with bleaching powder. If it is bleached entirely\r\nor to a large extent, the dye is cutch. If the bleach has no action,\r\nincinerate some of the dyed fibre in an iron crucible and heat the\r\nash on charcoal before the blowpipe. If a globule of lead is formed,\r\nwe have saturn red. The second portion is boiled with concentrated\r\nhydrochloric acid. If there is no action, we have Cologne umber; if\r\nthere is partial action, we have real umber; if the dye dissolves\r\ncompletely to a yellow solution, we have an ochre; if the solution is\r\ncolourless instead of yellow, and chlorine is evolved during solution,\r\nwe have manganese brown.\r\n\r\nIf the colour is yellow or orange, boil with concentrated hydrochloric\r\nacid. If we get a green solution and a white residue, we infer chrome\r\nyellow or orange. If we get a yellow solution, we boil it with a drop\r\nor two of nitric acid and then add some ammonium sulphocyanide. A red\r\ncolour shows an ochre or Sienna earth.\r\n\r\nIf the colour is green, boil with caustic soda lye. If the fibre turns\r\nbrown, we have chrome green. If no change takes place, boil with\r\nconcentrated hydrochloric acid. A yellow solution shows green earth; a\r\nred colour logwood plus fustic.\r\n\r\nIf the colour is blue or violet, boil with caustic soda lye. If the\r\nfibre turns brown, we have Prussian blue. If no change takes place,\r\nboil with concentrated hydrochloric acid. A yellow solution shows\r\nsmalts. If the colour is destroyed, and the smell of rotten eggs is\r\ndeveloped, we have ultramarine.\r\n\r\nIf the colour is black, warm with concentrated hydrochloric acid\r\ncontaining a little tin salt. If the black is unchanged, we have a\r\nblack pigment. If we get a pink to deep red solution we have logwood\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nBy means of the tests above detailed at length the group to which the\r\ndye belongs is discovered, and often the actual dye itself. Once the\r\ngroup is known it is generally easy, by means of the special reactions\r\ngiven in many books, _e.g._, in Schultz and Julius's \"Tabellarische\r\nÜbersicht,\" to identify the particular dye.\r\n\r\nWhen one has to deal with a single dye and simply desires to\r\ndetermine its group, the following table, due to J. Herzfeld, will\r\nsuffice. Originally intended for textiles, it will serve, with some\r\nmodifications here made in it, for the rapid testing of paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--RED AND REDDISH BROWN DYES.\r\n\r\nBoil the paper with a mixture of alcohol and sulphate of alumina. If\r\nno dye is extracted or a fluorescent solution is formed, we have an\r\ninorganic pigment, or eosine, phloxine, rhodamine, safranine, or one\r\nof their allies. Add bleaching powder solution, and heat. If the paper\r\nis bleached, add concentrated hydrochloric acid. A violet colour shows\r\nsafranine or an analogue. If there is no colour, but the fluorescence\r\ndisappears, we have eosine, phloxine, rhodamine, or one of their\r\nallies. If the paper is not bleached test for inorganic colouring\r\nmatters. Cutch brown is partly but not entirely bleached.\r\n\r\nIf the alumina solution gives a red or yellow solution without\r\nfluorescence, add to it concentrated sodium bisulphite. If bleaching\r\ntakes place, heat a piece of the paper with dilute spirit. A red\r\nextract shows sandal wood, fuchsine, etc. If there is little or no\r\nextract, we have acid fuchsine or one of its allies. If the bisulphite\r\ncauses no bleaching, boil a piece of the paper with very dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid. If the colour is unchanged, heat another piece of\r\nthe paper with dilute acetate of lead. If no change takes place, we\r\nhave an azo dye. If the colour turns to a dark brownish red, we have\r\ncochineal or the like. If the boiling with very dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid darkens the colour we have a substantive cotton dye.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.--YELLOW AND ORANGE DYES.\r\n\r\nHeat some of the paper with a not too dilute solution of tin salt in\r\nhydrochloric acid. If the colour is unchanged, with a colourless or\r\nyellow solution, boil some more paper with milk of lime. A change to\r\nreddish or brown shows turmeric or a congener. Absence of change shows\r\nphosphine, quinoline yellow, or a natural dye-stuff. If the acid tin\r\nsolution turns the paper red, and then quickly bleaches it to a pale\r\nyellow, we have fast yellow, orange IV., metanil yellow, brilliant\r\nyellow, or the like. If the tin turns the paper greyish, heat another\r\nportion with ammonium sulphide. A blackening shows a lead or iron\r\nyellow. If there is no change, we have naphthol yellow, auramine,\r\nazoflavine, orange II., chrysoidine, or one of their allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.--GREEN DYES.\r\n\r\nHeat a sample of the paper in dilute spirit. If the spirit acquires\r\nno colour, warm for a short time with dilute sulphuric acid. If both\r\npaper and solution become brownish red, we have logwood plus fustic. If\r\nthis fails, boil with concentrated hydrochloric acid. A yellow solution\r\nshows green earth. If this fails, boil with concentrated caustic soda.\r\nBrowning shows chrome green. If the spirit becomes blue, it is a case\r\nof paper which has been topped with blue on a yellow, brown, or green\r\nground. The solution and the insoluble part are separately tested. The\r\ncase is probably one of an aniline blue dyed over a mineral pigment. If\r\nthe spirit becomes green, heat with dilute hydrochloric acid. If the\r\nfibre is completely or nearly bleached, and the acid turns yellow, the\r\ndye is brilliant green, malachite green, or one of their allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.--BLUE AND VIOLET DYES.\r\n\r\nHeat some of the paper with dilute spirit. If the alcohol remains\r\ncolourless, we have Prussian blue or ultramarine. If it becomes blue\r\nor violet, shake some of the paper with concentrated sulphuric acid.\r\nA dirty olive green shows methylene blue, and a brownish colour shows\r\nspirit blue, water blue, Victoria blue, methyl violet, etc. If the\r\nspirit turns yellow, and the colour of the paper changes, we have wood\r\nblue or wood violet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPAPER MILL MACHINERY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the case of common printings and writings, which form the great\r\nbulk of the paper made, the possibility of one mill competing against\r\nanother, apart from the important factor of the cost of freight, coal,\r\nand labour, is almost entirely determined by the economy resulting from\r\nthe introduction of modern machinery.\r\n\r\nThe equipment of an up-to-date paper mill, therefore, comprises all\r\nthe latest devices for the efficient handling of large quantities of\r\nraw material, the economical production of steam, and the minimum\r\nconsumption of coal, matters which are of course common to most\r\nindustrial operations, together with the special machinery peculiar to\r\nthe manufacture of paper.\r\n\r\nThe amount of material to be handled may be seen from the table on page\r\n215, which gives the approximate quantities for the weekly output of a\r\ncommon news and a good printing paper.\r\n\r\n_Economy in Coal Consumption._--The reduction to a minimum of the\r\namount of coal required for a ton of paper has been brought about by\r\nthe use of appliances for the better and more regular combustion of\r\nthe coal, such as mechanical stokers, forced and induced draught, the\r\nintroduction of methods for utilising waste heat in flue gases by\r\neconomisers, and the waste heat in exhaust steam and condensed water\r\nby feed-water heaters, the adoption of machines for securing the whole\r\nenergy of the live steam by means of superheaters, adequate insulation\r\nof steam mains and pipes, high pressure boilers, and engines of most\r\nrecent design.\r\n\r\nThe firing of steam boilers is now conducted on scientific principles,\r\nthe coal being submitted regularly to proper analysis for calorific\r\nvalue, the evaporative power of the boilers being determined at\r\nintervals by adequate trials, the condition of the waste flue gases\r\nbeing automatically\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR NEWS AND PRINTINGS.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------+--------------+------------------\r\n             --                |  Common News.|  Good Printings.\r\n  -----------------------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n  Weekly output of paper, say  |    600 tons   |    250 tons\r\n  Mechanical wood pulp, moist, |               |\r\n     50 per cent. dry          |    800  \"     |      Nil.\r\n  Chemical wood pulp, dry      |    200  \"     |    150 tons\r\n  Esparto                      |     Nil.      |    200  \"\r\n  Soda ash                     |     Nil.      |     16  \"\r\n  Coal                         |    600 tons   |    800  \"\r\n  Lime                         |     Nil.      |     45  \"\r\n  China clay                   |     60 tons   |     25  \"\r\n  Bleach                       |     Nil.      |     30  \"\r\n  Alum, rosin, and chemicals   |     20 tons   |     20  \"\r\n  Water, per ton paper         |  8,000 gallons| 40,000 gallons\r\n  -----------------------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n\r\n_The Sarco Combustion Recorder._--This instrument is a device which\r\nautomatically records the percentage of carbonic acid gas in the waste\r\ngases from boiler furnaces. The flue gases are analysed at frequent\r\nand regular intervals, and the results of the analysis can be seen on\r\na chart immediately, so that it is possible to determine the effect of\r\nan alteration in the firing of the boilers within two minutes of its\r\ntaking place. The apparatus is rather complicated, but the principle\r\nupon which it is based is simple.\r\n\r\nMeasured quantities of the flue gases are drawn into graduated glass\r\ntubes and brought into contact with strong caustic soda solution, which\r\nabsorbs all the carbonic acid gas. The remaining gases not absorbed\r\nby the caustic soda are automatically measured and the percentage of\r\ncarbonic acid gas registered on the chart.\r\n\r\nThe use of suitable boiler feed-water is also an important factor in\r\nmodern steam-raising plant. The hot condensed water from the paper\r\nmachine drying cylinders, and exhaust steam from the engines and\r\nsteam-pipes, is returned to the stoke-hole to be utilised in heating up\r\nthe cold water which has been previously softened by chemical treatment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Conventional Diagram of a Water Softening\r\nPlant.\r\n\r\n  A.

Outlet for softened water.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Water Softening._--The water softeners available on the market are\r\nnumerous, and as each possesses special advantages of its own, it would\r\nbe almost invidious to select any one for particular notice.\r\n\r\nThey are based upon the principle of mixing chemicals with the water\r\nto be treated, so as to precipitate the matters in solution and\r\ngive a boiler feed-water free from carbonates and sulphates of lime\r\nand magnesia. The chemicals are added in the form of solutions of\r\ncarefully regulated strength to the water, which flow in a continuous\r\nstream into a tank. The flow of the water and chemical reagent is\r\nadjusted by previous analysis.\r\n\r\nThe various machines differ in details of construction, and in the\r\nmethods by which the mixing of the water and reagents is effected. The\r\nobject to be achieved is the complete precipitation of the dissolved\r\nsalts and the production of a clear water, free from sediment, in an\r\napparatus that will treat a maximum quantity of water at a cheap rate\r\nper 1,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nThe process needs proper attention. The addition of reagents in\r\nwrong proportions will do more harm than good, and possibly result\r\nin hardening the water instead of softening it. The following may be\r\nquoted as an example:--\r\n\r\n  ----------------------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n  Composition of Water. |  Before   |  After    |  Change.\r\n                        | Treatment.| Treatment.|\r\n  ----------------------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n  Calcium carbonate     |   13·863  |   38·920  | 25·057 gain\r\n  Calcium oxide (lime)  |    0·0    |   14·300  | 14·300  \"\r\n  Calcium silicate      |    2·062  |    3·591  |  1·529  \"\r\n  Calcium sulphate      |    1·625  |    2·121  |  0·496  \"\r\n  Magnesia              |    0·0    |    0·266  |  0·266  \"\r\n  Ferric oxide, etc.    |    0·447  |    0·987  |  0·540  \"\r\n                        +-----------+-----------+------------\r\n   Scale forming mineral|   17·997  |   60·185  | 42·188 gain\r\n                        +-----------+-----------+------------\r\n  Calcium chloride      |    1·331  |    2·114  |  0·783 gain\r\n  Magnesium chloride    |    0·672  |    0·0    |  0·672 loss\r\n  Sodium chloride       |    0·478  |    0·476  |  0·003  \"\r\n                        +-----------+-----------+------------\r\n   Soluble salts        |    2·482  |    2·590  |  0·108 gain\r\n                        +-----------+-----------+------------\r\n   Total mineral matter |   20·479  |   62·776  | 42·297 gain\r\n                        +-----------+-----------+------------\r\n  Carbonic acid gas     |    9·71   |    0·0    |  9·71  loss\r\n  Oxygen gas            |    0·66   |    0·66   |  0·0    \"\r\n  ----------------------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n\r\n  Treatment required: 1·8 lbs. of lime, 0·2 lbs. soda ash per 1,000\r\n      gallons.

The use of superheated steam is being extended\r\nin every direction, and, in addition to the advantages obtained in\r\nthe steam engine itself, its wider possibilities for the boiling of\r\nesparto, wood, and fibres generally have been noted. The following case\r\nmay be quoted as the result of a trial at a paper mill, showing for\r\nstated conditions the advantages of superheated steam:--\r\n\r\n    --------------------------+-------------+----------\r\n               --             | Superheated | Ordinary\r\n                              |    Steam.   |  Steam.\r\n    --------------------------+-------------+----------\r\n    Duration of test hours    |     26      |    34\r\n                              |             |\r\n    Coal consumed (lbs.)--    |             |\r\n      Per hour                |    610·5    |   661·5\r\n      Per 1 h.-p. hour        |      1·83   |     2·08\r\n                              |             |\r\n    Water evaporated (lbs.)-- |             |\r\n      Per hour                |  4,832      | 5,679\r\n      Per 1 h.-p. hour        |     14·55   |    17·8\r\n      From and at 212° F.     |      8·7    |     8·94\r\n                              |             |\r\n    Steam, temperature F.     |    464      |   334\r\n      Pressure                |     90·3    |    90·8\r\n                              |             |\r\n    Steam engine--            |             |\r\n      1 h.-p. total           |    331·5    |   323·2\r\n      Temperature F.          |    381·8    |   333·8\r\n                              |             |\r\n    Coal used per 1 h.-p.--   |             |\r\n      Per hour at boiler      |      1·83   |     2·08\r\n    --------------------------+-------------+----------\r\n\r\nThis appears to show a saving of 12 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Gas Producers._--The substitution of gas for steam in the paper mill\r\nhas not yet proved a success. The fact that heat is required for the\r\ndrying cylinders of a paper machine, and that the heat is most cheaply\r\nand readily obtained in the form of exhaust steam from the engines\r\ndriving the paper machine, militates considerably against economies\r\nwhich might otherwise be possible. The difficulties of heating such\r\ncylinders, or rather of properly controlling and regulating the\r\ntemperature by any other means than steam, may easily be surmised.\r\n\r\nGas engines of over 200 h.-p. seem to give considerable trouble at\r\npresent, but no doubt in course of time the required improvements will\r\nbe effected.\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that gas producers can only be economical\r\nwhen utilised for the production of gas on a large scale, and for\r\ndistribution to engines of smaller capacity than the main steam engine\r\nrequired in a paper mill. The peculiar conditions of the manufacture\r\nof paper do not appear to be favourable to the adoption of the gas\r\nproducer system in its present form.\r\n\r\n_Motive Power._--The paper-maker has taken advantage of every modern\r\nimprovement in steam engines for the purpose of reducing the cost of\r\nmotive power. Amongst other alterations in this direction the use of\r\na high speed enclosed engine and the employment of the modern steam\r\nturbine may be noted.\r\n\r\nIn the enclosed engine the working parts are boxed in by a casing\r\nfitted with oil-tight doors. The cranks and connecting rods splash into\r\nthe oil, which is thus thrown about in all directions, so as to ensure\r\nsufficient lubrication. Another feature of this engine is the variable\r\nspeed, and it is possible to run the paper machine at speeds varying\r\nfrom 100 to 500 ft. per minute without the use of change wheels.\r\n\r\n_Electrical Driving._--The application of electricity for motive power\r\nhas made steady advances in the paper mill. At first it was limited\r\nto the driving of machinery in which variations of speed or load were\r\nnot required to any large extent, but of recent years beating engines,\r\ncalenders, and paper machines have all been fitted with electrical\r\ndrives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--An \"enclosed\" Steam Engine.]\r\n\r\nThe following details relate to the installation at the Linwood Paper\r\nMills:--\r\n\r\nThe installation consists of 250-K.W. steam dynamos. The engines are\r\nWillan's high speed triple expansion, working with a boiler pressure of\r\n250 lbs. per square inch at the stop valve, the steam being superheated\r\nto give a temperature of 500° Fahr. at the engine. By means of jet\r\ncondensers a vacuum of 25 to 25½ inches is obtained on the engines.\r\nThe two boilers are of the Babcock type, and have 3,580 square feet of\r\nheating surface each. The furnaces have chain grate stokers, and the\r\nboilers are arranged with their own superheaters. The motor equipment\r\nconsists of eight 80, two 50, and ten 25 B.H.P. motors.\r\n\r\nSix of the 80 B.H.P. drive the beating engines, and it has been found\r\nthat the motors readily respond to an overload of 50 per cent. without\r\nbeating or other trouble. To remedy the excessive and sudden variation\r\na belt drive was adopted. An 80 motor drives the pulp refining engine.\r\nThe two paper-making machines have each two motors, one a 25 and a 50\r\nand the other two 25 B.H.P. motors. The speed can be regulated with\r\nexactitude. The auxiliary plant of the paper-making machine, pumps,\r\nagitators, etc., is worked from lines of shafting driven by motors.\r\n\r\nCalender motors are of the variable speed type, being designed to\r\nrun from 100 revolutions per minute to 600 revolutions per minute.\r\nVariations from 300 to 600 revolutions per minute can be regulated by\r\nthe shunts, the loss being negligible. Several of the motors are geared\r\nup to the various machines, as is the case with the calender.\r\n\r\nAs regards cost, the capital outlay on the 500-K.W. generating plant,\r\nincluding engines, dynamos, boilers, condensers, steam pipes, filters,\r\netc., and all engine room accessories, was £9,500.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--An Electrically Driven Paper Machine.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the plant also contains a Parson's steam\r\nturbine of 1,000 K.W., driving two continuous current dynamos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Diagram of the \"Eibel\" Process.]\r\n\r\n_The Eibel Patent._--One of the most important improvements in\r\nconnection with the manufacture of newspaper is the Eibel process,\r\ndesigned to increase the speed of the machine and to reduce the amount\r\nof suction at the vacuum box. In the ordinary machine the wire has\r\nusually been arranged to move in a horizontal plane. In some machines\r\nmeans have been provided for adjusting the breast-roll end of the wire\r\nto different elevations to provide for dealing with different grades\r\nof stock, but the wire has never hitherto been so inclined as to cause\r\nthe paper stock to travel at a speed, under the action of gravity, to\r\nequal or approximate the speed of the wire. In all previous methods\r\nof working, the wire has for a considerable portion of its length,\r\nstarting from the breast-roll, drawn the stock along in consequence of\r\nthe wire moving much faster than the stock, and the stock has waved, or\r\nrippled, badly near the breast-roll end of the wire. This has gradually\r\ndiminished until an equilibrium has been established and an even\r\nsurface obtained, but not until the waving or rippling has ceased at\r\nsome considerable distance from the breast-roll have the fibres become\r\nlaid uniformly, and the machines have therefore necessarily been run\r\nslowly to give ample time for the water to escape and for the fibres\r\nto lie down so as to make them a uniform sheet. In many cases the\r\nbreast-roll has been raised 14 or 15 inches, and the stock rushes, as\r\nit were, downhill.\r\n\r\nAs, during the formation of the paper, the stock and the wire\r\npractically do not move relatively to each other, there is no drag\r\nof the stock upon the wire; consequently there is a more rapid and\r\nuniform drainage of the water from the stock, the full influence of the\r\n\"shake\" is made effective to secure uniformity in the distribution and\r\ninterlocking of the fibres, and the regularity of the formation of the\r\npaper is not disturbed by waves or currents, which would otherwise be\r\ncaused by pull of the wire upon the stock.\r\n\r\nThis ingenious device is now working successfully in many paper mills.\r\n\r\n_Machinery._--In setting out the plant necessary for a paper mill\r\nwhich is designed to produce a given quantity of finished paper, the\r\nmanufacturer takes into consideration the class of paper to be made\r\nand the raw material to be employed. The following schedule has been\r\nprepared on such a basis:--\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT AND MACHINERY FOR HIGH-CLASS PRINTINGS.\r\n\r\n_Paper._\r\n\r\n    High-class printings made of wood pulp and esparto, used alone or\r\n      blended in varying proportions as required.

These conditions naturally vary\r\nin different mills, but such variations do not affect the schedule of\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\n_Unloading Sheds._\r\n\r\n    2 steam or electric cranes for handling fibre, clay, alum, bleach,\r\n      rosin, coal, and finished paper.\r\n\r\n    1 3-ton weighbridge.\r\n\r\n    1 5-cwt. platform scales.\r\n\r\n_Steam Plant._\r\n\r\n    6 8-ft. by 30-ft.

The Society\r\nof Arts and the Library Association in England and the Imperial Paper\r\nTesting Institute in Germany have already appointed special committees\r\nof inquiry, and from this it is evident that the subject is one of\r\nurgent importance.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes argued that the lack of durability is due to the want\r\nof care on the part of manufacturers in preserving the knowledge of\r\npaper-making as handed down by the early pioneers, but such an argument\r\nis superficial and utterly erroneous. The quality of paper, in common\r\nwith the quality of many other articles of commerce, has suffered\r\nbecause the demand for a really good high-class material is so small.\r\nThe general public has become accustomed to ask for something cheap,\r\nand since the reduction in price is only rendered possible by the use\r\nof cheap raw material and less expensive methods of manufacture, the\r\npaper of the present day, with certain exceptions, is inferior to that\r\nof fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe causes which favour the deterioration of paper are best understood\r\nby an inquiry into the nature of the fibres and other materials used\r\nand the methods of manufacture employed.\r\n\r\n_The Fibres Used._--Cotton and linen rags stand preeminent amongst\r\nvegetable fibres as being the most suitable for the production of\r\nhigh-class paper capable of withstanding the ravages of time. This\r\narises from the fact that cotton and linen require the least amount\r\nof chemical treatment to convert them into paper pulp, since they are\r\nalmost pure cellulose, cotton containing 98·7 per cent. of air-dry\r\ncellulose, and flax 90·6 per cent. The processes through which the raw\r\ncotton and flax are passed for the manufacture of textile goods are\r\nof the simplest character, and the rags themselves can be converted\r\ninto paper without chemical treatment if necessary. As a matter of\r\nfact certain papers, such as the O. W. S. and other drawing papers,\r\nare manufactured from rags without the aid of caustic soda, bleach, or\r\nchemicals. The rags are carefully selected, boiled for a long time in\r\nplain water, broken up and beaten into pulp, and made up into sheets by\r\npurely mechanical methods.\r\n\r\nThe liability of papers to decay, in respect of the fibrous\r\ncomposition, is almost in direct proportion to the severity of\r\nthe chemical treatment necessary to convert the raw material into\r\ncellulose, and the extent of the deviation of the fibre from pure\r\ncellulose is a measure of the degradation which is to be expected. The\r\nbehaviour of the fibres towards caustic soda or any similar hydrolytic\r\nagent serves to distinguish the fibres of maximum durability from\r\nthose of lesser resistance. It may be noted that in the former the\r\nraw materials, viz., cotton, linen, hemp, ramie, etc., contain a high\r\npercentage of pure cellulose, while in the latter the percentage of\r\ncellulose is very much lower, such fibres as esparto, straw, wood,\r\nbamboo, etc., giving only 40-50 per cent. of cellulose. The two\r\nextremes are represented by pure cotton rag and mechanical wood pulp.\r\nOther things being equal, the decay which may take place in papers\r\ncontaining the fibre only, without the admixture of size or chemicals,\r\nmay be considered as one of oxidation, which takes place slowly in\r\ncotton, and much more rapidly with mechanical wood pulp. Experimental\r\nevidence of this oxidation is afforded when thin sheets of paper made\r\nfrom these materials are exposed to a temperature of 100° to 110° C.\r\nin an air oven. The cotton paper is but little affected, while the\r\nmechanical wood pulp paper soon falls to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe order of durability of various papers in relation to the fibrous\r\nconstituents may be expressed thus: (1) rag cellulose; (2) chemical\r\nwood cellulose; (3) esparto, straw, and bamboo celluloses; (4)\r\nmechanical wood pulp. The rate and extent of oxidation is approximately\r\nshown by the effect of heat as described. The differences between\r\nthe celluloses are also shown by heating strips of various papers in\r\na weak solution of aniline sulphate, which has no effect on wood or\r\nrag cellulose, dyes esparto and straw a pinkish colour, and imparts a\r\nstrong yellow colour to mechanical wood pulp and jute.\r\n\r\n_Physical Qualities._--The permanence of a paper depends not only upon\r\nthe purity of the fibrous constituents and the freedom from chemicals\r\nlikely to bring about deterioration, but also upon the general physical\r\nproperties of the paper itself. Other things being equal, the more\r\nresistant a paper is to rough usage the longer will it last. The reason\r\nwhy rag papers are so permanent is that not only is the chemical\r\ncondition of the cellulose of the highest order, but the physical\r\nstructure of the fibre is such that the strength of the finished paper\r\nis also a maximum.\r\n\r\nThe methods of manufacture may be modified to almost any extent, giving\r\non the one hand a paper of extraordinary toughness, or on the other\r\nhand a paper which falls to pieces after a very short time. Thus a\r\nstrong bank-note paper may be crumpled up between the fingers three\r\nor four hundred times without tearing, while an imitation art paper is\r\nbroken up when crumpled three or four times.\r\n\r\nA thorough study of the physical qualities of a paper is therefore\r\nnecessary to an appreciation of the conditions for durability. The\r\nphysical structure of the fibre, the modifications produced in it by\r\nbeating, the effect of drying, sizing, and glazing upon the strength\r\nand elasticity of the finished paper, are some of the factors which\r\nneed to be considered.\r\n\r\n_Strength._--The strength of a paper as measured by the tensile strain\r\nrequired to fracture a strip of given width, and the percentage of\r\nelongation which the paper undergoes when submitted to tension, are\r\nproperties of the utmost importance. The elasticity, that is, the\r\namount of stretch under tension, has not received the attention from\r\npaper-makers that it deserves. If two papers of equal tensile strength\r\ndiffer in elasticity, it may be taken for granted that the paper\r\nshowing a greater percentage of elongation under tension is the better\r\nof the two.\r\n\r\nThe strength of a paper, as already indicated, is greatly influenced by\r\nthe conditions of manufacture. This has been explained in the chapter\r\ndevoted to the subject of beating, and other examples are briefly given\r\nin the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\n_Bulk._--The manufacture during recent years of light bulky papers for\r\nbook production has accentuated the problem in a marked degree, and the\r\nfactor of _bulk_ as one of the causes of deterioration is therefore\r\na comparatively new one. It is interesting to notice that the rapid\r\ndestruction of such books by frequent use is in no way related to the\r\nchemical purity of the cellulose of which it is composed, or to the\r\ninfluence of any chemical substance associated with the fibre. It is\r\npurely a mechanical question, to be explained by reference to the\r\nprocess of manufacture.\r\n\r\nThis paper is made from esparto entirely, or from a mixture of esparto\r\nand wood pulp. The pulp is beaten quickly, and for as short a time as\r\npossible, little or no china clay being added, and only a very small\r\npercentage of rosin size. The wet sheet of paper is submitted to very\r\nlight pressure at the press rolls, and the bulky nature is preserved by\r\nomitting the ordinary methods of calendering.\r\n\r\nThe paper thus produced consists of fibres which are but little felted\r\ntogether. The physical condition and structure of the paper are readily\r\nnoticeable to the eye, and when these peculiarities are reduced\r\nto numerical terms the effect of the conditions of manufacture is\r\nstrikingly displayed.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this special treatment is best seen by contrasting the\r\nbulky esparto featherweight paper with the normal magazine paper made\r\nfrom esparto. In the latter case a smoother, heavier, stronger sheet\r\nof paper is made from identically the same raw material. But the pulp\r\nis beaten for a longer period, while mineral matter and size are added\r\nin suitable proportions. The press rolls and calenders are used to the\r\nfullest extent.\r\n\r\nThe difference between these two papers, both consisting, as they do,\r\nof pure esparto with a small proportion of ash may be emphasised by\r\ncomparing the analysis by _weight_ with analysis by _volume_. The two\r\npapers in question when analysed by weight proved to have the following\r\ncomposition:--\r\n\r\n      --------------------------------------------\r\n                    |      Parts by Weight.\r\n                    +----------------+------------\r\n           --       | Featherweight. |  Ordinary.\r\n      --------------+----------------+------------\r\n      Esparto fibre |      96·0      |    95·4\r\n      Ash, etc      |       4·0      |     4·6\r\n                    |     -----      |   -----\r\n                    |     100·0      |   100·0\r\n      --------------+----------------+------------\r\n\r\nBut if the papers are compared in terms of the _composition by volume_,\r\nit will be found that the featherweight contains a large amount of air\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n      --------------+-----------------------------\r\n                    |     Composition by Volume.\r\n                    +----------------+------------\r\n             --     | Featherweight. |  Ordinary.\r\n      --------------+----------------+------------\r\n      Esparto fibre |      28·0      |     65·5\r\n      Ash, etc      |       0·7      |      1·8\r\n      Air space     |      71·3      |     32·7\r\n                    |     -----      |    -----\r\n                    |     100·0      |    100·0\r\n      --------------+----------------+------------\r\n\r\nIn other words, the conditions of manufacture for the bulky paper are\r\nsuch that the fibres are as far apart from one another as possible, and\r\nthe cohesion of fibre to fibre is reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nWhile paper of this description is agreeable to the printer, and\r\nprobably to the general reading public, yet its strength and physical\r\nqualities, from the point of view of resistance to wear and tear, are\r\nof the lowest order. It is very difficult to rebind books made from it,\r\nwhich is not altogether to be wondered at, seeing that the bookbinder's\r\nstitches can hardly be expected to hold together sheets containing 60\r\nto 70 per cent. of air space.\r\n\r\nThis concrete case emphasises the necessity for including in a schedule\r\nof standards of quality a classification of papers according to\r\nstrength and bulk.\r\n\r\n_Surface._--The introduction of new methods of printing has brought\r\nabout some changes in the process of glazing and finishing paper which\r\nare not altogether favourable to the manufacture of a sheet having\r\nmaximum qualities of strength and elasticity, two conditions which are\r\nessential to permanence. In other words, the very high finish and\r\nsurface imparted to paper by plate-glazing, supercalendering, water\r\nfinish, and other devices of a similar character is carried to excess.\r\n\r\nAll papers are improved in strength by glazing up to a certain point,\r\nbut over-glazing crushes the paper, renders it brittle and liable to\r\ncrack. Unfortunately, the maximum strength of a paper is generally\r\nreached before the maximum of finish, with the result that the former\r\nis frequently sacrificed to the latter. The usual result of glazing\r\nis found in an increase of 8 to 10 per cent. in the tensile strength,\r\nbut a diminution of elasticity to the extent of 8 to 10 per cent. With\r\nsupercalendered magazine papers, the high surface is imparted for the\r\nsake of the illustrations which are produced by methods requiring it.\r\nThe addition of considerable quantities of clay or mineral substances\r\nimproves the finish, so that the question of the relation of glazing\r\nto strength, surface, and loading is one which affects the subject of\r\ndeterioration of paper very materially. With writing paper the false\r\nstandard of an \"attractive\" appearance is almost universally accepted\r\nby the public as the basis of purchase without any reference to actual\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n_Mineral Substances._--China clay, sulphate of lime, agalite and other\r\ninert mineral substances are important factors in lowering the quality\r\nof paper, not so much in promoting the actual deterioration of paper\r\nby any chemical reaction with the fibres, as in making the paper less\r\ncapable of resistance to the influence of atmospheric conditions and\r\nordinary usage. Clay in small, well-defined quantities serves a useful\r\npurpose, if added to some papers, because it favours the production\r\nof a smooth surface, but when the combination of mineral substances\r\nis carried to an extreme, then the result from the point of view of\r\npermanence is disastrous. This is well recognised by all paper-makers,\r\nand in Germany the limits of the amount of clay or loading in\r\nhigh-grade paper have been rigidly fixed. In the case of _imitation\r\nart_ paper, which contains 25 to 30 per cent. of its weight of clay,\r\nthe strength and resistance of the sheet is reduced to a minimum. The\r\npaper falls to pieces if slightly damped, the felting power of the\r\nfibres being rendered of no effect owing to the weakening influence of\r\nexcessive mineral matter. This paper is used chiefly for catalogues,\r\nprogrammes, circulars, and printed matter of a temporary and evanescent\r\ncharacter, and so long as it is confined to such objects it serves\r\na useful purpose, being cheap, and suitable for the production of\r\nillustrations by means of the half-tone process; but its lasting\r\nqualities are of the lowest order. The addition of 10 per cent. of any\r\nmineral substance must be regarded as the maximum allowance for papers\r\nintended for permanent and frequent use.\r\n\r\n_Coating Material._--The ingenious method for producing an absolutely\r\neven surface on paper by the use of a mixture of clay or other mineral\r\nsubstance and an adhesive like glue or casein brushed on to the surface\r\nof the paper, is responsible for many of the complaints about the\r\npapers of the present day.\r\n\r\nThe sole merit of this substance is the facility with which half-tone\r\nprocess blocks can be utilised for the purpose of picture production.\r\nBeyond this, nothing can be said. The paper is brittle, susceptible to\r\nthe least suspicion of dampness, with a high polish which in artificial\r\nlight produces fatigue of the reader's eye very quickly, heavy to\r\nhandle, and liable to fall to pieces when bound up in book form.\r\n\r\nAs the fibrous material is completely covered by mineral substances, it\r\nis frequently considered of secondary importance, with the result that\r\nthe \"value\" of the paper is judged entirely by the surface coating,\r\nwith little regard to the nature of the body paper. In such cases, with\r\nan inferior body paper, the pages of a book very quickly discolour, and\r\nthe letterpress becomes blurred.\r\n\r\n  ANALYSIS OF A TYPICAL ART PAPER.\r\n\r\n  ---------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n           | Per Cent. |           |   Volume\r\n     --    |    by     |    --     | Composition\r\n           |  Weight.  |           |  per Cent.\r\n  ---------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n  Fibre    |    77·5   | Fibre     |    68·3\r\n  Ash, etc.|    22·5   | Ash       |    12·0\r\n           |           | Air space |    19·7\r\n           |   -----   |           |   -----\r\n           |   100·0   |           |   100·0\r\n  ---------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n\r\n_Rosin._--The presence of an excess of rosin is a well-known factor in\r\nthe disintegration of the paper, even when the fibrous composition is\r\nof the highest order. The decomposition is largely due to the action\r\nof light, many experiments having been made by Herzberg and others to\r\ndetermine the nature of the reactions taking place. One of the chief\r\nalterations is the change brought about in the ink-resisting qualities\r\nof the paper.\r\n\r\nThe actual character of the chemical reactions as far as the effect\r\non the fibre is concerned is not accurately known. The degradation\r\nof a hard-sized rosin paper by exposure to strong sunlight, for\r\nexample, is probably due to the alteration in the rosin size, and not\r\nto any material change in the cellulose. It is hardly conceivable\r\nthat in a pure rag paper sized with rosin and yielding readily to ink\r\npenetration, after about one year's exposure to light, the cellulose\r\nitself had undergone any chemical changes capable of detection.\r\n\r\n_Gelatine._--Papers properly sized with gelatine are preferable\r\nto those sized with rosin for the majority of books and documents\r\npreserved under normal circumstances. But the nature of a tub-sized\r\npaper may be, and often is, greatly altered by unusual climatic\r\nconditions. In hot, damp countries papers are quickly ruined, and\r\nhigh-class drawing papers sized with gelatine often rendered useless.\r\nThe change is scarcely visible on the clean paper, and is only observed\r\nwhen the paper is used for water-colour work, the colour appearing\r\nblotchy in various parts of the sheet where the gelatine has been\r\ndecomposed by the united action of heat and damp.\r\n\r\nThe artist is frequently compelled in such cases to put a layer of\r\nheavy white colour on the sheet of paper before proceeding to paint the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nThe storage of books under favourable conditions has a great deal to\r\ndo with the permanence of the paper, and the degradation of a paper in\r\nrelation to the tub-sizing qualities is much hastened by the presence\r\nof moisture in the air.\r\n\r\n_Starch._--The same is true of starch, which is largely employed as\r\na binding or sizing material in paper. The degradation of gelatine,\r\nstarch, and similar nitrogenous substances is due to the action of\r\norganisms, and the following experiments, suggested by Cross, are\r\ninteresting in this connection.\r\n\r\nIf strips of paper are put into stoppered bottles with a small quantity\r\nof warm water and kept at a temperature of about 80° F., fungus\r\ngrowths will be noticed on some of them after the lapse of fourteen\r\ndays. Rag papers sized with gelatine will show micro-organisms of all\r\nkinds. A pure cellulose paper, like filter paper, will not produce any\r\nsuch effects. The result in the first case is due to the nitrogenous\r\nsubstance, viz., the gelatine used in sizing, since the two papers\r\nare identical as far as the cellulose fibres are concerned. High-class\r\nwood pulp papers, unless sized with gelatine, would not show similar\r\nresults. The action of the organisms upon the nitrogenous material by a\r\nprocess of hydrolysis is in the direction of the production of soluble\r\ncompounds allied to the starch sugars capable of being assimilated by\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nThe cellulose of esparto and straw are readily attacked, and it is\r\non this account that the tissues of the various straws are digested\r\nmore or less when eaten by animals. It is for this reason that the\r\ncelluloses from straw and esparto are inferior to the cotton cellulose\r\nin producing a paper likely to be permanent.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Residues._--The necessity for manufacturing a pure cellulose\r\nhalf-stuff is fully recognised by paper-makers. This was not the case\r\nin the early days of the manufacture of wood pulp, for it is a matter\r\nof common experience that many of the books printed on wood pulp paper\r\nbetween 1870 and 1880 are in a hopeless condition, and it is quite easy\r\nto find books and periodicals of that date the pages of which crumble\r\nto dust when handled. This serious defect has been proved to be due to\r\nthe presence of traces of chemicals used in manufacture which have not\r\nbeen thoroughly removed from the pulp.\r\n\r\nThe precautions necessary in bleaching pulp by means of chloride of\r\nlime, in order to prevent (1) any action between the fibre and the\r\ncalcium hypochlorite, (2) the presence of residual chlorine or soluble\r\ncompounds derived from it, and (3) the presence of by-products arising\r\nfrom the use of an antichlor, are also well known to paper-makers. The\r\nsubject has been closely studied by chemists, who have shown that the\r\ndeterioration of many modern papers may be ascribed to carelessness in\r\nbleaching.\r\n\r\nThe questions relating to the chemical residues of paper can only be\r\nadequately dealt with by a discussion of actual cases which arise from\r\ntime to time. There are certain conditions in manufacture, common to\r\nall papers, which may give rise to the presence of chemical residues,\r\nof which two have already been mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe acidity of papers is frequently quoted as an instance. It is true\r\nthat the presence of free acid in a paper is most undesirable, as it\r\nseriously attacks the cellulose, converting it into an oxidised form.\r\nThis in course of time renders the paper so brittle as to destroy its\r\nfibrous character.\r\n\r\nThe change is brought about by the acid, which itself suffers no\r\nmaterial alteration, so that the process of deterioration is continued\r\nalmost indefinitely until the cellulose is completely oxidised. Most\r\npapers, however, show an acid reaction when tested with litmus, the\r\nusual reagent employed by those not familiar with the proper methods\r\nof testing paper. All papers which have been treated with an excess\r\nof alum for sizing purposes would show an acid reaction with litmus\r\nwithout necessarily containing any free acid.\r\n\r\nThe presence of iron is undesirable, particularly in photographic\r\npapers, and since cellulose has a remarkable affinity for iron, the\r\nconditions of manufacture which tend to leave iron in the pulp have to\r\nbe taken into consideration. The presence of minute quantities of iron\r\nin the form of impurities must not be confused with the presence of\r\niron in large quantities derived from the toning and colouring of paper\r\nby means of iron salts.\r\n\r\nThe fading of colour is frequently observed when coloured papers are\r\ntested on boxboards, particularly those made of straw. This fading may\r\noften be traced to the presence of alkali in the straw board which has\r\nnot been completely removed in the process of manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe blurring of letterpress is a defect which often occurs with\r\nprinting papers made of chemical wood pulp. The oil in the ink\r\nseems to separate out on either side of the letter, producing a\r\ndiscoloration. In such cases the paper itself frequently exhibits an\r\nunpleasant smell.\r\n\r\nThese defects are usually determined by the presence of traces of\r\nsulphur compounds in the paper resulting from incomplete washing of\r\nthe pulp in manufacture. The presence of sulphur compounds sometimes\r\nassociates itself with papers which have been coloured by means of\r\nultramarine, which in presence of alum is slightly decomposed by the\r\nheat of the drying cylinders.\r\n\r\nSome knowledge of the effect of chemical residues in paper is\r\nimportant, not only in regard to the deterioration which takes place\r\nin the fibre itself, but also in relation to the fading of the ink\r\nwhich is used. The subject of the ink has received much attention\r\nfrom chemists on account of the serious difficulties which have been\r\nexperienced by State departments in various countries.\r\n\r\nThe United States Department of Agriculture have devised certain\r\nmethods for ascertaining the suitability of stamping ink used by the\r\nGovernment and suggest the qualities desirable in such an ink. The ink,\r\nfirst of all, must produce an indelible cancellation; that is, it must\r\nbe relatively indelible as compared with the ink used for printing\r\nthe postage stamps. The post-mark made with the ink must dry quickly\r\nin order that the mail matter may be handled immediately without any\r\nblurring or smearing of the post-mark.\r\n\r\nBoth this property and the property of the indelibility involve the\r\nquestion of the rate at which the ink penetrates or is absorbed by the\r\nfibre of the paper. A satisfactory ink does not harden or form a crust\r\non the ink-pad on exposure to air. There must be no deposition of solid\r\nmatter on the bottom of the vessel in which the ink is stored, and the\r\npigments on which the indelibility of the ink depends, if insoluble,\r\nmust not settle out in such a way as to make it possible to pour off\r\nfrom the top of the container a portion of the ink which contains\r\nlittle or none of the insoluble pigment or pigments.\r\n\r\n_Colour._--If the subject of deterioration of paper is to be considered\r\nin its broadest sense as including changes of any kind, the fading of\r\ncolour must be taken into account. The use of aniline dyes which are\r\nnot fast to light results in a loss of colour in paper just as with\r\ntextiles, and the fading may be regarded as a function of the dye and\r\nnot as arising from its combination with the paper.\r\n\r\nThe gradual fading of some dyes, however, and of many water-colour\r\npigments may be traced to the presence of residual chemicals in the\r\npaper and to the presence of moisture in an atmosphere impregnated\r\nwith gaseous or suspended impurities. In fact the latter is a greater\r\nenemy to permanence of colour than light, since it has been proved by\r\nexperiment that most colours do not fade when exposed to light in a\r\nvacuum. The oxygen of the air in combination with the moisture present\r\nis the principal agent in bringing about such changes. The dulling\r\nof bronze, or imitation gold leaf, on cover papers is a practical\r\nillustration of this, though this can hardly be quoted as an instance\r\nof actual deterioration of the paper.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of the original colour can only be assured by the\r\ncareful selection of pure fibrous material, the use of fast dyes,\r\nand the preservation of the book or painting from the conditions\r\nwhich favour the fading as described above. For common papers such\r\nprecautions become impossible, but for water-colour drawings and\r\nvaluable papers they are essential.\r\n\r\nThe demand for an abnormally white paper is indirectly the cause of\r\ndeterioration in colour, but in this case the ultimate effect is not a\r\nfading but a discoloration of white to a more or less distinct yellow\r\nor brown colour, due to changes in the fibre which may often be traced\r\nto excessive bleaching. In this case the fading of colour is directly\r\ndue to deterioration of the paper itself, and may occur in celluloses\r\nof the best type. With lower-grade papers containing mechanical wood\r\npulp the degradation of colour and fibre is inevitable.\r\n\r\n_Air and Moisture._--The exact effects produced on paper freely\r\nexposed, or in books as ordinarily stored, depend upon the condition of\r\nthe atmosphere. Pure air has little or no action upon paper, cellulose\r\nbeing a remarkably inert substance, and even in impure mechanical wood\r\npulp, if merely exposed to pure dry air, the signs of decay would be\r\ndelayed considerably. The combined action of air and moisture is of a\r\nmore vigorous character in promoting oxidation changes in the fibres,\r\nor a dissociation of the sizing and other chemical ingredients of the\r\npaper. The presence of moisture is, indeed, absolutely essential for\r\nthe reaction of some substances upon one another, and it is easy to\r\nshow that certain chemical compounds can be left in ultimate contact,\r\nif absolutely dry, for a lengthened period without reacting, but the\r\naddition of a little moisture at once produces chemical union. This may\r\nbe shown by a simple experiment.\r\n\r\nThus a piece of coloured paper which may be bleached immediately\r\nif suspended in an atmosphere of ordinary chlorine gas will remain\r\nunbleached for several hours if first thoroughly dried in an oven and\r\nexposed to dry gas.\r\n\r\nIn the case of books and papers, these conditions which promote slow\r\ndisintegration are aggravated by the presence of impurities in the\r\nair, such as the vapours of burning gas, the traces of acidity in\r\nthe atmosphere of large manufacturing towns, the excessive dampness\r\nand perhaps heat of a climate favouring the growth of organisms. All\r\nthese factors are of varying degrees in different places, so that the\r\ndeterioration of papers does not proceed in the same measure and at the\r\nsame rate everywhere.\r\n\r\n_Moisture._--It may not be out of place to discuss some important\r\nrelations between moisture and the physical qualities of a sheet of\r\npaper. A paper in its normal condition always contains a certain\r\nproportion of water as one of its ingredients, and the presence of this\r\nmoisture has much to do with the strength, elasticity, and use of the\r\npaper, the absence of moisture giving rise to defects and troubles in\r\nthe use of the paper which to a certain extent lower its commercial\r\nvalue and deteriorate it, though not perhaps in the sense of permanent\r\ndegradation of quality.\r\n\r\nOne trouble frequently experienced by stationers and others is that\r\nknown as wavy edges. The edges of a stack containing sheets of paper\r\npiled upon one another frequently twist and curl, producing what are\r\nknown as wavy edges. This arises from the fact that the paper when\r\nmanufactured was deficient in natural moisture, and that when stacked\r\nit has gradually absorbed moisture, which is taken up first by the\r\nedges exposed to the air. This causes unequal expansion of the fibres\r\nwith the production of the so-called wavy edges. The only remedy in\r\nsuch cases is the free exposure of the sheets before printing, so that\r\nthe moisture is absorbed equally all over the sheet. The cracked edges\r\nof envelopes may be explained by reference to the same conditions. The\r\npaper is worked up into envelopes in an over-dry condition, and the\r\nfibres, being somewhat brittle, readily break apart from one another.\r\nIf the paper is kept in stock for some time before use this defect can\r\nbe very largely remedied.\r\n\r\nWith supercalendered papers it is only possible to obtain the best\r\nresults by allowing the paper to stand for several days after making\r\nbefore it is glazed.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from these few examples that many of the troubles\r\nexperienced by printers are due to the fact that orders for paper\r\nare frequently accompanied by an instruction for immediate delivery,\r\nunder which circumstances it is impossible to obtain the best results.\r\nThe expansion of papers used for lithography, and the bad register\r\nfrequently seen in colour work, may be explained by reference to the\r\nbehaviour of the individual fibres towards moisture. The expansion is\r\nusually greater in one direction of the paper than in the direction\r\nat right angles to it, and this is due to the fact that fibres have a\r\ngreater ratio of expansion in the diameter than in the length.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of papers when damped is a peculiarity well known to\r\npaper-makers and printers. For certain purposes it is desirable that\r\npaper should not show any material alteration when damped, since\r\nany expansion of the sheet is liable to throw the printing out of\r\n\"register.\" The liability of papers to such stretch or expansion is\r\nlargely minimised by careful manipulation of the pulp during the\r\nprocess of beating, and also by a proper regulation of the web of paper\r\nas it passes from the wet end of the paper machine over the drying\r\ncylinders to the calenders. The paper which fulfils the necessary\r\nqualifications as to a minimum stretch is prepared from pulp which has\r\nnot been beaten for too long a period, so that the pulp obtained is\r\nfairly light and bulky. By this means the expansion of the fibres takes\r\nplace in the sheet itself without making any material alteration in its\r\nsize. That is to say, as the sheet of paper is fairly _open_, there is\r\nsufficient room for expansion, which thus takes place with the least\r\nalteration of the total area of the sheet. The paper which is allowed\r\nto shrink on the machine during the process of drying, without undue\r\ntension, usually exhibits a minimum amount of expansion subsequently in\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice that the expansion of paper is different for\r\nthe two directions, that is for the machine and cross directions.\r\n\r\nThis arises from the fact that in the machine-made paper the greater\r\nproportion of the fibres point in the direction of the machine while\r\nthe paper is being made. In consequence of this the expansion of the\r\npaper is greatest in what is known as the cross direction of the paper,\r\nthat is, in the direction at right angles to the flow of the pulp along\r\nthe machine wire.\r\n\r\nThis is to be explained by reference to the behaviour of fibres when\r\ndamped or brought into contact with an excess of water. The question\r\nof the exact changes in the dimensions of a fibre due to absorption of\r\nwater has been dealt with in an interesting manner by Hohnel. He points\r\nout that the well-known peculiarity of the shrinkage of ropes which\r\nhave been lying in the water can be explained by an examination of the\r\nbehaviour of the single fibres. He relates in detail the experiment\r\nwhich can be carried out for the exact observation of the fibres when\r\nin contact with water. A dry fibre when soaked in water appears to\r\nbecome 20 to 30 per cent. greater in diameter, whereas in length it is\r\nusually only increased by one-tenth per cent.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted by Hohnel was to place a fibre of convenient length\r\non a glass slip down the centre of which was a fine narrow groove\r\ncapable of holding water, so that the fibre could be wetted. Over the\r\nfibre was a cover glass with a small scale marked on it. The loose\r\nend of the fibres passed over a small roller and was stretched by a\r\nlight weight. The movements of the fibre were measured by means of an\r\neye-piece micrometer.\r\n\r\nIn this way it is possible to determine alterations in length to within\r\n0·005 per cent., and this variation can be directly seen under the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nHohnel observes in his account of the experiments that all fibres\r\nbecome thicker when wetted, that vegetable fibres are more susceptible\r\nthan animal fibres.\r\n\r\nAnimal fibres expand about 10 to 14 per cent. in diameter, but\r\nvegetable fibres as much as 20 per cent., as shown in the following\r\ntable:--\r\n\r\n  -------------+----------+------------------+----------\r\n  Animal Fibre.| Per Cent.| Vegetable Fibre. | Per Cent.\r\n  -------------+----------+------------------+----------\r\n  Human hair   |  10·67   | New Zealand flax |   20·0\r\n  Angora wool  |  10·2    | Aloe hemp        |   25·8\r\n  Alpaca wool  |  13·7    | Hemp             |   22·7\r\n  Tussah silk  |  11·0    | Cotton           |   27·5\r\n  -------------+----------+------------------+----------\r\n\r\nThe reverse is the case when the expansion of the fibres in regard to\r\nlength is considered, since animal fibres expand 0·50 to 1·00 per cent.\r\nof their length, and vegetable fibres only 0·05 to 0·10 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe maximum amount of expansion in the case of the vegetable fibres is\r\nobtained by gently breathing upon them rather than by the use of an\r\nexcess of water.\r\n\r\nThese figures are important as explaining many of the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of vegetable and animal fibres. Advantage is taken of\r\nthe greater expansion of the latter in the manufacture of instruments\r\nfor the measurement of moisture, such as the hair hygrometer, in which\r\nthe elongation of a stretched hair registers the variation in the\r\nmoisture of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n_Quality of Book Papers._--The Committee of the Society of Arts in\r\ndealing with the evidence as to the permanence of finished papers\r\nsuggest the following classification as indicating the desired\r\nstandards of quality:--\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) CLASSIFICATION AS TO FIBRES.\r\n\r\n  A. Cotton, flax, and hemp.\r\n\r\n  B. Wood celluloses, (_a_) sulphite process, and (_b_) soda and\r\n      sulphate process.\r\n\r\n  C. Esparto and straw celluloses.\r\n\r\n  D. Mechanical wood pulp.\r\n\r\nThe Committee find little fault with the Principles which govern the\r\ntrade in the manufacture of high-class papers, and limit the result of\r\ntheir investigation to the suggestion of a normal standard of quality\r\nfor book papers required in documents of importance according to the\r\nfollowing schedule:--\r\n\r\n  _Fibres._--Not less than 70 per cent. of fibres of Class A.\r\n\r\n  _Sizing._--Not more than 2 per cent. rosin, and finished with the\r\n            normal acidity of pure alum.\r\n\r\n  _Loading._--Not more than 10 per cent. total mineral matter (ash).\r\n\r\nWith regard to written documents, it must be evident that the proper\r\nmaterials are those of Class A, and that the paper should be pure,\r\nsized with gelatine and not with rosin. All imitations of high-class\r\nwriting papers, which are in fact merely disguised printing papers,\r\nshould be carefully avoided.\r\n\r\nThese recommendations are good as far as they go, but in order to\r\nestablish the proper standards of quality some specifications must be\r\nlaid down with regard to the strength of the paper and its physical\r\nproperties, together with a reference to the use for which the paper\r\nis intended. The physical condition of the paper itself apart from the\r\nnature of the fibre has much to do with its resistance to wear and\r\ntear, and this is easily proved by comparing modern book papers made\r\nfrom esparto with book papers of an earlier date made from the same\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThe only official schedule of requirements in relation to public\r\ndocuments is that issued by the Stationery Office.\r\n\r\nThe details set out relate chiefly to questions of weight and strength,\r\nthe limits being expressed in definite form and not allowing much\r\nmargin for variation in respect of strength or fibrous constituents.\r\nMechanical wood pulp is excluded in all papers except common material\r\nas stated in the schedule. The papers required for stock are divided\r\ninto twelve classes. In each class the trade names of various sized\r\npapers are given, the size of the sheet and the weight of the ream,\r\nand, where required, any special characteristics are set out. The\r\nschedule is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class 1. Hand-made or Mould-made._\r\n\r\n_General Specification._--Hand-made or mould-made. Animal tub-sized.\r\n(\"Hand-made\" or \"Mould-made\" to be marked on the wrapper.)\r\n\r\nWhere special water-marking is required mould will be supplied by the\r\nStationery Office for those papers made by hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class 2. Writings, Air-dried._\r\n\r\n_General Specification._--Plate rolled. Machine made. Animal tub-sized.\r\nAir-dried. (Must bear ink after erasure.)\r\n\r\n_Note._--The mean breaking strain and mean stretch required are given\r\nfor each paper. The figures represent the mean of the results obtained\r\nfor both directions of the sheet, and are calculated on a strip of\r\npaper five-eighths of an inch wide and having a free length of seven\r\ninches between the clips.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class 3. Writings, Ordinary._\r\n\r\n_General Specification._--Rolled. Machine-made. Animal tub-sized.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class 4. Writings, Coloured._\r\n\r\n_Specification._--Highly rolled. Machine-made. Animal tub-sized.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class 5. Blotting Papers._\r\n\r\n_Specification._--All rag. Machine-made. Free from loading.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class 6. Printing and Lithographic Papers._\r\n\r\n_General Specification._--Rolled. Machine-made. Engine-sized. Loading\r\nnot to exceed 15 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class 7. Coloured Printings._\r\n\r\n_General Specification._--Rolled. Machine-made. Engine-sized.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class 8. Copying and Tissue Papers._\r\n\r\n_Specification._--Machine-made. Free from loading. (Copying papers are\r\nrequired to give three good copies.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class 9. Brown Papers, Air-dried._\r\n\r\n_Specification._--Air-dried. Machine-made.\r\n\r\n_Note._--The mean breaking strain and mean stretch required are given\r\nfor each paper. The figures represent the mean of the results obtained\r\nfor both directions of the sheet, and are calculated on a strip of\r\npaper two inches wide and having a free length of seven inches between\r\nthe clips.\r\n\r\nIn the case of papers indicating a larger breaking strain than the\r\nminimum required, a proportional increase in the stretch must also be\r\nshown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class 10. Brown Paper, Cylinder-dried._\r\n\r\n_General Specification._--Machine-made.\r\n\r\n_Note._--The mean breaking strain required is given for each paper. The\r\nfigures represent the mean of the results obtained for both directions\r\nof the sheet, and are calculated on a strip of paper two inches wide\r\nand having a free length of seven inches between the clips.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class 11. Smallhands._\r\n\r\n_General Specification._--Machine-made. Engine-sized.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class 12. Buff Papers._\r\n\r\n_Specification._--Highly finished both sides. Machine-made. Hard\r\nengine-sized.\r\n\r\nMechanical wood pulp must not be used in the manufacture of any papers,\r\nwith the exception of engine-sized coloured printings, and buff papers,\r\nwhere an addition up to 25 per cent. will be allowed.\r\n\r\nAll animal tub-sized papers are required to be as far as possible free\r\nfrom earthy matter; and, except where specially stated, the amount of\r\n_loading_ added to other papers must not exceed 6 per cent.\r\n\r\nWhen sulphite or soda pulps are used, either separately or conjointly,\r\nin the manufacture of printing papers, the quantity of neither material\r\nshall separately exceed 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe most complete specification as to the requirements for standard\r\npapers is that published by the Paper Testing Institute in Germany, and\r\nused as the basis of most contracts, at least for public and official\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\n_Standards of Quality in Germany._--The classification of papers\r\naccording to the raw materials used and the nature of the finished\r\npaper is very complete. The classification is made under three\r\nheadings: (_A_) Raw Material; (_B_) Strength; (_C_) Uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(A) Classification according to Material._\r\n\r\n(1) Paper made from rags only (linen, hemp, and cotton).\r\n\r\n(2) Paper made from rags with a maximum of 25 per cent. of cellulose\r\nfrom wood, straw, esparto, manila, etc., but free from mechanical wood\r\npulp.\r\n\r\n(3) Paper made from any fibrous material, but free from mechanical wood\r\npulp.\r\n\r\n(4) Paper of any fibrous material.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(B) Classification according to Strength._\r\n\r\n  ----------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------\r\n          Class         |   1.  |   2.  |   3.  |   4.  |   5.  |   6.\r\n  ----------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------\r\n  Mean tearing length   |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n   in metres            | 6,000 | 5,000 | 4,000 | 3,000 | 2,000 | 1,000\r\n                        |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  Elasticity per cent.  |   4   |  3·5  |   3   |  2·5  |   2   |  1·5\r\n                        |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n  Resistance to folding |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n   (Schoppers' method,  |       |       |       |       |       |\r\n   number of foldings)  |  190  |  190  |   80  |   40  |   20  |   3\r\n  ----------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------\r\n\r\nThe tests for tearing length, resistance to folding, elasticity,\r\netc., are made in air showing relative humidity of 65 per cent.

Index.\r\n\r\nTwo departments of Engineering and their applications to industry form\r\nthe subject of this volume: the \"natural\" sources of water and wind\r\npower which supply mechanical energy without any intermediate stage of\r\ntransformation. Most people will be surprised at the extent to which\r\nthese natural power producers are used. The widespread application\r\nof water power is generally known, but it is interesting to learn\r\nthat the demand for windmills was never so great as it is to-day, and\r\nthere are signs of abnormal expansion in the direction of their useful\r\napplication in the great agricultural countries of the world. Though\r\nprimarily of importance to the engineer, this work will be of great\r\ninterest to every manufacturer who in economizing his means of power\r\nproduction can take the natural forces that lie to his hand and harness\r\nthem in his service. The author is the son of Sir Robert Ball, the\r\neminent mathematician and astronomer.\r\n\r\n\r\n  $Liquid and Gaseous Fuels, and the Part they play in Modern Power\r\n      Production.$ By Professor VIVIAN B.

The official name now given to this branch of electrical\r\npractice is Radio-Telegraphy. The subject has now reached a thoroughly\r\npracticable stage, and this book presents it in clear, concise form.\r\nThe various services for which Radio-Telegraphy is or may be used are\r\nindicated by the author. Every stage of the subject is illustrated by\r\ndiagrams or photographs of apparatus, so that, while an elementary\r\nknowledge of electricity is presupposed, the bearings of the subject\r\ncan be grasped by every reader. No subject is fraught with so many\r\npossibilities of development for the future relationships of the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n  $India-Rubber and its Manufacture, with Chapters on Gutta-Percha\r\n      and Balata.$ By H.

Index.\r\n\r\nThis volume is for users of glass, and makes no claim to be an\r\nadequate guide or help to those engaged in glass manufacture itself.\r\nFor this reason the account of manufacturing processes has been\r\nkept as non-technical as possible. In describing each process the\r\nobject in view has been to give an insight into the rationale of each\r\nstep, so far as it is known or understood, from the point of view of\r\nprinciples and methods rather than as mere rule of thumb description\r\nof manufacturing manipulations. The processes described are, with the\r\nexception of those described as obsolete, to the author's definite\r\nknowledge, in commercial use at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n  $Precious Stones.$ By W.
