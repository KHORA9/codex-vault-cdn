Girard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nTexas has a great variety of rocks and minerals—some are common and\r\nothers are not. This book is designed to acquaint you with some of them\r\nand to tell you in a nontechnical way what they are like, some of the\r\nplaces where they are found, and how they are used. Although we do not\r\nknow exactly how all of the rocks and minerals formed, some of the ideas\r\nabout their origin are mentioned.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to learn more about rocks and minerals in general, the\r\nnames of several reference books are listed on page 100. In addition,\r\nscientific reports that describe in detail many of the rocks and\r\nminerals of Texas have been published by the Bureau of Economic Geology\r\nof The University of Texas, the United States Geological Survey, and\r\nother organizations. A selected list of these reports is given on pages\r\n100-101.\r\n\r\nRocks and minerals are familiar objects to all of us. We pick up\r\nattractive or unusual pebbles for our collections, we admire rocky\r\nmountain peaks, we speak of the mineral resources of our State and\r\nNation. Rocks and minerals enter, either directly or indirectly, into\r\nour daily living. From them come the soils in which grow the grains, the\r\nfruits, and the vegetables for our food, the trees for our lumber, and\r\nthe flowers for our pleasure. The iron, copper, lead, gold, silver, and\r\nmanganese, the sulfur and salt, the clays and building stones, and the\r\nother metals and nonmetals that we require for our way of living were\r\nonce a part of the earth’s crust.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Texas’ highest mountain is Guadalupe Peak, right, with\r\nan elevation of 8,751 feet. El Capitan, left, has an elevation of 8,078\r\n    feet. These peaks in the Guadalupe Mountains in Culberson County\r\n   consist largely of Capitan reef limestone, which formed during the\r\n                            Permian Period.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Earth’s Outer Crust\r\n\r\n\r\nRocks and minerals make up most of the outer layer or crust of our\r\nearth—the actual ground beneath our feet. The crust is approximately 18\r\nto 30 miles thick beneath the continents. In general, the outermost part\r\nconsists of many layers of stratified rocks, one above another. The\r\nolder rocks normally make up the bottom or the deeper layers, and the\r\nyounger rocks form the upper layers. Not all the layers are perfectly\r\nflat and parallel—some are lenticular (lens-shaped), some are tilted,\r\nsome are partly eroded away, and some are present in one place and\r\nabsent in another. Beneath the continents, the layers of rock rest on\r\nancient metamorphic rocks and on great masses of igneous rock such as\r\ngranite. These lower rocks are known as the _basement_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Earth’s outer crust (thickness not drawn to scale).]\r\n\r\n  Over much of the land surface of the earth, the outermost layer is\r\n  made up of layers of rock\r\n\r\n  On the continents, the layers of rock rest on metamorphic rocks and on\r\n  igneous rocks such as granite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Geologists\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who study the earth’s crust—its origin, history, rocks, minerals,\r\nfossils, and structure—are known as _geologists_. The geologists who are\r\nespecially interested in a particular phase of _geology_, as this\r\nscience is called, are given special names: those who study fossils are\r\ncalled _paleontologists_; those who study minerals are called\r\n_mineralogists_; those who study rocks are called _petrologists_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Time and Rock Units\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earth’s crust is believed to be at least 3¼ billion years old. In\r\norder to deal with this vast stretch of time, geologists have divided\r\nthe billions of years into various time units and have given each unit a\r\nname. The great divisions of geologic time, called _eras_, are Early\r\nPrecambrian, Late Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. These\r\neras are divided into smaller units of time called _periods_, and the\r\nperiods are divided into _epochs_. The _[xx time scale]_ shows the\r\ngeologic time divisions. Earliest geologic time is shown at the bottom\r\nof the scale; most recent is shown at the top.\r\n\r\nBy examining and studying the different rocks and rock layers,\r\ngeologists try to discover in which unit of geologic time these rocks\r\nformed. Those rocks that formed during a _period_ of geologic time are\r\ncalled a _system_ of rocks; those that formed during an _epoch_ are\r\ncalled a _series_. For example, the Cambrian System of rocks formed\r\nduring the Cambrian Period; the Cretaceous System of rocks formed during\r\nthe Cretaceous Period; the Tertiary System of rocks formed during the\r\nTertiary Period. We are now in the younger epoch (called Recent) of the\r\nQuaternary Period of the Cenozoic Era. The rocks that are forming now\r\nare the Recent Series of rocks.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: Geologic time scale]\r\n\r\n  ERA\r\n    PERIOD\r\n      EPOCH\r\n  CENOZOIC\r\n    QUATERNARY (lasted 0-1 million years)\r\n      Recent\r\n      Pleistocene\r\n    TERTIARY (lasted 62 million years)\r\n      Pliocene\r\n      Miocene\r\n      Oligocene\r\n      Eocene\r\n      Paleocene\r\n  —63 million years ago—\r\n  MESOZOIC\r\n    CRETACEOUS (lasted 72 million years)\r\n    JURASSIC (lasted 46 million years)\r\n    TRIASSIC (lasted 49 million years)\r\n  —230 million years ago—\r\n  PALEOZOIC\r\n    PERMIAN (lasted 50 million years)\r\n    PENNSYLVANIAN (lasted 30 million years)\r\n    MISSISSIPPIAN (lasted 35 million years)\r\n    DEVONIAN (lasted 60 million years)\r\n    SILURIAN (lasted 20 million years)\r\n    ORDOVICIAN (lasted 75 million years)\r\n    CAMBRIAN (lasted 100? million years)\r\n  —600? million years ago—\r\n  LATE PRECAMBRIAN\r\n  EARLY PRECAMBRIAN\r\n\r\nThese time estimates are from the paper, Geologic Time Scale, by J.\r\nLawrence Kulp, published in Science, Vol. 133, No. 3459, April 14, 1961.\r\n(The time divisions are not drawn to scale)\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: Plate 10.

One of these, called\r\na _group_, is made up of two or more _formations_. A _formation_\r\ncomprises rocks or strata (layers of rock) that are recognized and\r\nmapped as a unit. Some formations consist of layers of one particular\r\ntype of rock, such as limestone or shale. Formations are named after a\r\nnearby geographic locality, and in some formation names, the type of\r\nrock is included. For example, three of the Texas geologic formations\r\nare called Buda Limestone, Del Rio Clay, and Eagle Ford Shale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Geologic Map\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _geologic map_ (pp. 4-5) shows the rocks that are found at the\r\nsurface in Texas. Some of these are extremely old. Some, geologically\r\nspeaking, are very young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      WHAT ARE ROCKS AND MINERALS?\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough _rocks_ and _minerals_ are often mentioned together, and to\r\nsome people they have similar meanings, geologists make a distinction\r\nbetween the two words. In general, rocks are made up of minerals, and\r\nminerals are made up of chemical elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Chemical Elements\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _chemical elements_ include oxygen, silicon, calcium, sulfur,\r\ncarbon, gold, silver, and many others. There are 90 naturally occurring\r\nelements. Each is made up of molecules that consist of only one kind of\r\natom. Chemical elements may either be combined with each other or occur\r\nalone. They are the building blocks of our world for they make up all\r\nthe gases, all the liquids, all the minerals, all the plant and animal\r\nlife, and all the other physical matter. Some of the chemical elements\r\nthat occur in the rocks and minerals mentioned in this book are listed\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n  Aluminum         Al\r\n  Barium           Ba\r\n  Beryllium        Be\r\n  Boron            B\r\n  Calcium          Ca\r\n  Carbon           C\r\n  Cerium           Ce\r\n  Chlorine         Cl\r\n  Copper           Cu\r\n  Fluorine         F\r\n  Gold             Au\r\n  Hydrogen         H\r\n  Iron             Fe\r\n  Lead             Pb\r\n  Magnesium        Mg\r\n  Manganese        Mn\r\n  Mercury          Hg\r\n  Molybdenum       Mo\r\n  Oxygen           O\r\n  Potassium        K\r\n  Silicon          Si\r\n  Silver           Ag\r\n  Sodium           Na\r\n  Strontium        Sr\r\n  Sulfur           S\r\n  Thorium          Th\r\n  Tin              Sn\r\n  Uranium          U\r\n  Vanadium         V\r\n  Yttrium          Y\r\n  Zinc             Zn\r\n  Zirconium        Zr\r\n\r\nWe can compare the chemical elements to the letters of our alphabet. The\r\nletters, like the chemical elements, are fundamental building blocks,\r\nand they can be brought together in various combinations to form words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Minerals\r\n\r\n\r\nA _mineral_ can be compared to a word of our language. We combine\r\nletters to form a word, and nature combines certain chemical elements to\r\nform each particular mineral. For example, calcite, a mineral that is\r\nabundant in Texas, is always made up of the same proportions of the same\r\nthree elements: calcium, carbon, and oxygen.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: A mineral is made up of chemical elements. The mineral\r\n   _calcite_, for example, always consists of the same proportions of\r\n                     calcium, carbon, and oxygen.]\r\n\r\nEach mineral has its own characteristic internal structure and other\r\nproperties. At ordinary temperatures, nearly all the minerals are solids\r\nrather than gases or liquids. (Water and mercury are the principal\r\nexceptions.) In addition, minerals are inorganic rather than being\r\ncomposed of plant or animal matter.\r\n\r\nWhen a single chemical element is found alone in nature as a _solid_, it\r\nis considered to be a mineral, too. Gold, silver, copper, lead, and\r\nsulfur are some of the chemical elements that can occur alone as solid\r\nminerals. When they occur this way, we refer to them as _native_ silver,\r\n_native_ copper, or _native_ sulfur. Although the element mercury is a\r\nliquid rather than a solid at ordinary temperatures, it too is a mineral\r\nwhen it occurs alone in nature. It is then called _native_ mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Rocks\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already compared the chemical elements to the alphabet and the\r\nminerals to words. We can now go a step further and compare rocks to\r\nsentences. We put words together to make sentences; nature puts minerals\r\ntogether to make rocks. A sentence does not have to be made up of a\r\ndefinite number of words, nor does a rock have to be made up of a\r\ndefinite number of minerals. Some rocks, such as granite, may be\r\ncomposed of several minerals. Others, such as dolomite and rock gypsum,\r\nconsist of only one mineral.\r\n\r\nMinerals do not lose their identities when they make up a rock. Instead,\r\nthey are merely associated together in varying proportions. Some rocks,\r\nas we will find later, instead of being composed of the minerals\r\nthemselves, are made up of fragments of earlier-formed rocks.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, we think of rocks as hard and solid substances, such as\r\nlimestone and granite, but some geologists consider loose and uncemented\r\nmaterials, such as sand, gravel, or volcanic ash, to be rocks also. The\r\nwords _sediments_ or _deposits_ are often used to describe this\r\nuncemented or loose material.\r\n\r\nRocks are commonly grouped, according to how they formed, into three\r\ngreat classes known as _igneous_, _metamorphic_, and _sedimentary_.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: A rock is made up of minerals. The igneous rock\r\n _granite_, for example, consists chiefly of quartz and feldspar; other\r\n      minerals such as mica and hornblende are commonly present.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             IGNEOUS ROCKS\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks result from the cooling of hot, molten rock material or\r\n_magma_. Magma that reaches the surface through volcanoes is called\r\n_lava_. Magma comes from deep within the earth and is made up of a\r\nmixture of molten mineral materials. Igneous rocks have been forming\r\nthroughout the geologic past and are still forming today. We can\r\nunderstand how they form when we look at pictures of hot, molten lava\r\nflowing from volcanoes, such as Mauna Loa in Hawaii. As lava cools, it\r\nhardens into rock.\r\n\r\n                  Extrusive or Volcanic Igneous Rocks\r\n\r\nThe igneous rocks that form on the earth’s surface are called\r\n_extrusive_ or _volcanic_ igneous rocks. When magma flows to the\r\nsurface, it cools and hardens quickly. The mineral grains that form\r\nduring this fast cooling may be too small to be distinguished from each\r\nother. Some lava cools too quickly for minerals to crystallize—then the\r\nrock is volcanic glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Extrusive igneous rocks form at the earth’s surface from\r\n            lava that cools and hardens relatively quickly.]\r\n\r\nNo volcanic igneous rocks are forming in Texas now. However, during\r\nTertiary time, in the Big Bend area and in other parts of the\r\nTrans-Pecos country of west Texas, lava came to the surface and\r\nhardened. (The physiographic outline map, p. 42, shows where these areas\r\nare located.)\r\n\r\n                        Intrusive Igneous Rocks\r\n\r\nThe cooling and hardening of hot, molten magma also takes place below\r\nthe earth’s surface. Here, the magma cools slowly to form rocks made up\r\nof mineral grains that are large enough to be readily visible. These\r\nrocks are known as _intrusive_ igneous rocks. We know that they are\r\npresent below the surface in Texas because of wells drilled in many\r\nareas of the State. In Pecos County, a well reached granite, an\r\nintrusive igneous rock, at a depth of 16,510 feet. Other wells in Texas\r\nhave reached the granite basement rocks at much shallower depths. But\r\nnot all intrusive igneous rocks in Texas are found underground. In the\r\nTrans-Pecos country of west Texas, in the Balcones fault zone, and in\r\nthe Llano uplift of central Texas, some are now seen at the surface.\r\nThey, like all intrusive rocks, were formed below the ground, but\r\nearth’s processes of uplift and erosion have gradually uncovered them.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Intrusive igneous rocks form from molten rock material\r\n      (magma) that cools and hardens beneath the earth’s surface.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SEDIMENTARY ROCKS\r\n\r\nSedimentary rocks are made up of sediments, which are rock and mineral\r\ngrains that have come from weathered rocks of all kinds. Rocks are\r\nweathered when water, ice, snow, wind, and other agents cause them\r\neither to dissolve, as table salt does when put in water, or to break\r\napart, as old pavement commonly does.\r\n\r\n                                 Soils\r\n\r\nSome of the broken-down rocks, along with associated plant and animal\r\nmatter, develop into soils. When you examine soil with a magnifying\r\nglass, you may be able to see some of the small rock and mineral grains\r\nthat still remain in it. Some soils have formed on top of the rocks from\r\nwhich they came, and some have been moved in from another place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Soils develop from weathered rock and associated organic\r\n                               material.]\r\n\r\n  SOIL\r\n  SUBSOIL\r\n  WEATHERED ROCK\r\n  BEDROCK\r\n\r\n             Sedimentary Rock Materials in Broken Fragments\r\n\r\nWater and wind not only weather the rocks and soils but also move the\r\nweathered materials (the sediments) and deposit them in other places.\r\nWhenever you see a dust or sand storm, or a muddy creek or river, you\r\nare observing the movement of sediments by wind and water to other land\r\nareas or to the sea. The combination of weathering and movement is\r\ncalled _erosion_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Conglomerate from Webb County, Texas, is composed of\r\n            rounded gravel that has been cemented together.]\r\n\r\nSome of the rock fragments carried by water are still fairly large when\r\nthey reach their destinations. On the basis of size, they are called\r\n_boulders_, _cobbles_, _pebbles_, and _granules_. Loose deposits of\r\nthese larger-size sediments make up what is known as _gravel_. Nature\r\ncements gravels together to form rocks such as _conglomerates_ (made up\r\nof rounded gravel) and _breccias_ (made up of sharp-cornered gravel).\r\n\r\nThe finer sediments are called _sand_, _silt_, _mud_, and _clay_. When\r\ncemented, the sand grains become _sandstones_, the silt particles become\r\n_siltstones_, and the mud and clay particles become _shale_. The\r\nsedimentary rocks that are made up of these rock fragments are called\r\n_clastic_ or _fragmental_ rocks.\r\n\r\n                 Sedimentary Rock Materials in Solution\r\n\r\nAs they are weathered, some rocks dissolve and go into solution. For\r\nexample, a number of the Texas creeks and rivers carry calcium carbonate\r\nin solution because they flow through areas where limestone rocks, which\r\nconsist mostly of calcium carbonate, are being weathered. (Water that\r\ncontains a large amount of dissolved rock material is called _hard_\r\nwater.)\r\n\r\n             _Cementing materials and chemical sediments._—\r\n\r\nSome of the waters containing dissolved rock material seep through loose\r\nsediments where the dissolved material may come out of solution and form\r\na _cement_, which binds the sediments together. For example, when loose\r\nsand sediments are cemented, they form sandstone. Three of the most\r\ncommon cements are iron oxide, calcium carbonate, and silicon dioxide,\r\nalthough a number of other materials also serve as cements.\r\n\r\nDissolved rock materials come out of solution not only to serve as\r\ncementing agents but to form the chief mineral of some sedimentary rocks\r\nas well. Sedimentary rocks of this kind form mostly in lakes and seas\r\ninto which much dissolved material is carried by rivers. When the\r\ndissolved material comes out of solution, it is said to be\r\n_precipitated_ and the mineral sediments it forms are the _chemical_\r\nsediments. Some limestones originate this way. You can see examples of\r\nprecipitated materials by noting the crust-like deposits that form\r\ninside some water pipes and teakettles, as dissolved material in the\r\nwater comes out of solution.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Precipitated sediments are commonly observed lining a\r\n                              teakettle.]\r\n\r\n           _Sedimentary rocks formed by plants and animals._—\r\n\r\nThe dissolved rock material can come out of solution in another way.\r\nSome plants and animals are able to take dissolved calcium carbonate out\r\nof the sea water and use it to build their shells and other structures.\r\nSome of these organisms, such as corals and algae, can grow upward from\r\nthe sea floor in large groups to form reefs that later become reef\r\nlimestones. Other limestones are made up of the remains of plants and\r\nanimals that collect on the sea floor and become cemented together.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           METAMORPHIC ROCKS\r\n\r\nMetamorphic rocks come from earlier-formed rocks that have undergone a\r\nchange or a _metamorphosis_. All igneous and sedimentary rocks, and\r\nearlier-formed metamorphic rocks too, can be changed, without being\r\nmoved to some other place, into new and different rocks. As they are\r\nchanged, they may become harder, new minerals may form, and they may\r\nlook entirely different. For example, granite, an igneous rock, can be\r\nchanged into the metamorphic rock known as _gneiss_; limestone, a\r\nsedimentary rock, can be changed into _marble_; shale, a sedimentary\r\nrock, can be changed into _slate_. These changes occur because the earth\r\nis a big and complex chemical system. The agents that bring about these\r\nchanges, which always occur below the surface of the earth, are heat,\r\npressure, and fluids—both liquids and gases. Several different kinds of\r\nchange or metamorphism can take place.\r\n\r\n                          Static Metamorphism\r\n\r\nSome of the changes occur because the rocks are at great depths. As more\r\nand more younger rocks are deposited on top of them, the older rocks\r\nbecome deeply buried. The great thicknesses of younger rocks are heavy,\r\nand they squeeze and press down on the rocks beneath them. The deeply\r\nburied rocks are also hotter than surface rocks. In general, the\r\ntemperature increases about 1° Fahrenheit for each 50 feet of depth\r\nbelow the surface. The change of deeply buried rocks into new rocks by\r\npressure and heat is known as _static metamorphism_.\r\n\r\n                          Contact Metamorphism\r\n\r\nAnother method of change or metamorphism involves molten igneous rock\r\nmaterial. When hot magma moves up through rocks, it not only heats and\r\npushes them, but it also may soak them with liquids and gases, causing\r\nthe nearby rocks to change into new rocks, by a process called _contact\r\nmetamorphism_.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Some rocks are altered by heat and fluids when they are\r\n    invaded by hot magma in a process called contact metamorphism.]\r\n\r\n  UNALTERED ROCK\r\n  METAMORPHIC ROCK\r\n  MAGMA\r\n\r\n                          Dynamic Metamorphism\r\n\r\nStill another rock-changing process is one that is associated with\r\nmountain building. When mountains are formed, heat and great pressures\r\ndevelop deep within the earth’s crust. The flat layers of rock are then\r\nslowly pushed and squeezed so that they bend up into arches, fracture,\r\nor slide over each other. These forces cause great changes in the rocks\r\nin widespread areas. This process of change is known as _dynamic\r\nmetamorphism_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Occurrence and Properties of Minerals\r\n\r\n\r\n                           HOW MINERALS OCCUR\r\n\r\nRocks are made up of minerals. In addition, minerals are associated with\r\nrocks in other ways. For example, minerals fill or coat cracks and\r\ncavities that have developed in some of the rocks. Minerals are either\r\ncrystalline or amorphous.\r\n\r\n                          Crystalline Minerals\r\n\r\nMost minerals are crystalline. In crystalline minerals, combinations of\r\natoms are arranged in ordered patterns, which are repeated over and\r\nover. This orderly internal structure of atoms is a characteristic of\r\neach crystalline mineral, as mineralogists are able to determine by\r\nusing X-rays and special microscopes.\r\n\r\n                              _Crystals._—\r\n\r\nWhen a mineral occurs as a well-formed individual crystal, it has a\r\ndefinite, precise shape. The kind of crystal shape it has depends on its\r\nown type of crystalline internal structure. A well-formed crystal has\r\nsmooth, flat, outer surfaces called _crystal faces_, which are arranged\r\ntogether to form prisms, cubes, pyramids, and many other geometric\r\nshapes. For example, quartz, a common Texas mineral, is commonly found\r\nas a six-sided, prism-shaped crystal that is topped by pyramid-like\r\nforms. Pyrite, another common mineral, occurs as cube-shaped crystals.\r\nWe can identify some minerals more readily by learning to recognize\r\ntheir crystal shapes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A scalenohedron, one of the many crystal forms of\r\n                               calcite.]\r\n\r\n                         _Imperfect crystals._—\r\n\r\nA crystalline mineral commonly forms under conditions that do not permit\r\nit to become a well-shaped crystal. Although the mineral may show a few\r\ncrystal faces, it does not have a complete crystal shape and so is\r\ndescribed as _massive_, or is said to occur in _masses_. Some of the\r\nminerals that make up rocks occur as crystalline masses. For example,\r\n_calcite_ is a crystalline mineral that occurs in the metamorphic rock\r\n_marble_ without its normal crystal shape.\r\n\r\nMany crystalline minerals occur as incomplete and imperfect crystals\r\nthat are grouped together in various arrangements. If these incomplete\r\ncrystals are arranged around a common center like the spokes of a wheel,\r\nthey are said to be _radial_ or _radiated_. If the groups of incomplete\r\ncrystals look like bundles of strings or fibers, they are described as\r\n_fibrous_. If they are in rounded masses that resemble bunches of\r\ngrapes, they are called _botryoidal_. If they look like fish scales,\r\nthey are described as _scaly_. Some crystalline minerals are made up of\r\ntiny grains that are grouped together like the grains in a lump of\r\nsugar. A mineral occurring in this way is described as _granular_. More\r\ndescriptions of crystalline minerals are found in the section on Texas\r\nrocks and minerals (pp. 43-98).\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: Barite specimen showing radial form.]\r\n\r\n                           Amorphous Minerals\r\n\r\nAn amorphous mineral, unlike a crystalline mineral, does not have a\r\ndefinite, orderly arrangement of its atoms. Because of this lack of\r\ninternal structure, the mineral occurs in masses that have no regular\r\ngeometric shapes, and it has no crystal form of its own. Only a few\r\nminerals are amorphous.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SOME DISTINGUISHING PROPERTIES OF MINERALS\r\n\r\nWe use our senses of sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste to become\r\naware of the world around us. For example, we recognize a flower by\r\nnoting its color, its fragrance, and the texture, shape, and arrangement\r\nof its petals. These are some of its characteristic properties. A\r\nmineral also has distinguishing properties, among them color, luster,\r\nand hardness, which help us identify it. Some minerals have a single\r\noutstanding property, such as the magnetism of magnetite, that makes\r\nthem easier to recognize. But to identify most minerals, we need to\r\ndetermine not just one, but several properties.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: Chalcedony showing botryoidal form.]\r\n\r\n                                 Color\r\n\r\nColor is one of the properties we notice first. The color of some\r\nminerals is always the same, and it helps us to identify them. But it is\r\nnot a dependable property to use in identifying all minerals, because\r\nsome contain impurities that change or hide the real color.\r\n\r\n                                 Luster\r\n\r\nThe luster is the way the surface of a mineral reflects light. The\r\nluster of a mineral may be _nonmetallic_, _submetallic_, or _metallic_.\r\nMineral metals such as gold, silver, galena, and pyrite have a\r\n_metallic_ luster. A few minerals have a luster that is almost, but not\r\nquite metallic—their luster is _submetallic_. A mineral with a\r\nnonmetallic luster may look _vitreous_ (glassy), _silky_, _resinous_\r\n(like resin), _greasy_, _earthy_ (dull), _pearly_, or _adamantine_\r\n(brilliant).\r\n\r\n                         Transmission of Light\r\n\r\nSome minerals allow light to pass through them; others do not. A mineral\r\nis _transparent_ if you can see both light and objects through it, as\r\nthrough clear glass. If you can see only light, but no objects, as\r\nthrough frosted glass, the mineral is _translucent_. When you hold an\r\n_opaque_ mineral up to the light, it looks dark. No light at all comes\r\nthrough it, even through the thin edges.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: Transparent mineral.]\r\n\r\n                                Hardness\r\n\r\nSome minerals are soft and can be scratched easily. Others, which are\r\nharder, are resistant to scratching. To measure a mineral’s hardness, we\r\ntry to find out which substances will scratch it and which substances\r\nwill not scratch it. To do this in a general way, several ordinary\r\nobjects—such as a fingernail, a copper penny, a pocket knife, a piece of\r\nwindow glass, and a steel file—can be used. For a more exact way of\r\ntesting hardness, we can use ten minerals that make up what is known as\r\n_Mohs scale_. Each mineral in this scale has a different hardness, and\r\neach one has been given a number that represents its hardness. For\r\nexample, talc, the softest mineral in this scale, is given a hardness of\r\n_1_. Gypsum, the next softest mineral in the scale, has a hardness of\r\n_2_. Diamond, the hardest mineral known, is given the top hardness of\r\n_10_ in this scale. These ten minerals are listed below. Alongside them\r\nare five common objects with their hardnesses.\r\n\r\n  1—Talc\r\n  2—Gypsum         Fingernail—slightly over 2\r\n  3—Calcite        Copper penny—about 3\r\n  4—Fluorite\r\n  5—Apatite        Pocket knife—slightly over 5\r\n  6—Orthoclase     Window glass—5½\r\n  7—Quartz         Steel file—about 6½\r\n  8—Topaz\r\n  9—Corundum\r\n  10—Diamond\r\n\r\nSuppose, for example, that a mineral can be scratched by fluorite, which\r\nhas a hardness of _4_ on Mohs scale, but cannot be scratched by calcite,\r\nwhich has a hardness of _3_. We then know that this mineral is softer\r\nthan fluorite, but harder than calcite; therefore, it has a hardness of\r\nabout _3½_. In the same way, if a mineral can be scratched by a pocket\r\nknife, which is slightly more than _5_ in hardness, but not by a copper\r\npenny, which has a hardness of about _3_, we know then that its hardness\r\nis between _3_ and _5_.\r\n\r\n                            Streak or Powder\r\n\r\nThe streak is the mark, made of fine powder, that a mineral leaves as\r\nyou rub it across a streak plate. A streak plate is a flat piece of\r\nwhite tile or porcelain that has a dull, unglazed surface. The streak\r\nplate is about as hard as quartz, which is _7_ on Mohs scale, and you\r\nwill not be able to use it for minerals that have a greater hardness.\r\nFor these, you can obtain the powder by scratching the mineral or by\r\ncrushing a small piece of it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A streak plate is used to determine the color of the\r\n                    streak or powder of a mineral.]\r\n\r\nThe color of the streak or powder is extremely helpful in identifying\r\nsome minerals. For example, hematite is a mineral that may be any one of\r\nseveral different colors, but its streak or powder is always reddish\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\n                                Cleavage\r\n\r\nAs they break, some crystalline minerals always split along a smooth,\r\nflat surface. This property is known as cleavage. Some cleavages are\r\nsmooth and perfect; others are not so perfect. The cleavage surfaces,\r\nbecause of the mineral’s crystalline internal structure, are parallel to\r\npossible crystal faces, even though the mineral itself may occur as a\r\ncrystalline mass without a perfect crystal shape.\r\n\r\nSome minerals will cleave in only one direction; some, in several\r\ndirections. For example, galena, a mineral found in Texas, has perfect\r\n_cubic_ cleavage. It cleaves in three directions that are at right\r\nangles to each other. These cleavage directions are parallel to possible\r\ncubic crystal faces, and some of the cleavage fragments are cubes.\r\n\r\n                                Parting\r\n\r\nA few minerals sometimes show a kind of false cleavage known as\r\n_parting_. Parting, unlike cleavage, is not constant and does not occur\r\nin every specimen of a particular mineral. For this reason, it is not a\r\nvery dependable means of identification.\r\n\r\n                                Fracture\r\n\r\nMinerals also break in another way. When the break is in a different\r\ndirection from that of the cleavage or parting, it is known as the\r\nfracture. A fracture is called _conchoidal_ if the mineral’s broken\r\nsurface is curved like the inside of a spoon or shell. Thick pieces of\r\nglass break with this conchoidal fracture. A fracture is described as\r\n_hackly_ if the broken surface has sharp, jagged edges; as _even_, if\r\nthe surface is generally flat; and as _uneven_, if it is rough and not\r\nflat. If the mineral breaks into splinters, its fracture is called\r\n_splintery_.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: Conchoidal fracture.]\r\n\r\n                            Specific Gravity\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity is a measure of whether a mineral is heavy or\r\nlight. It is a comparison of the weight of a piece of the mineral with\r\nthe weight of an equal volume of water. The mineral quartz, for example,\r\nhas a specific gravity of 2.65. This means that a piece of quartz is a\r\nlittle more than 2½ times as heavy as an equal volume of water. Accurate\r\nmeasurements of specific gravity can be made in a laboratory. You can,\r\nhowever, learn to estimate specific gravities just by lifting various\r\nminerals and judging whether they are heavy or light.\r\n\r\n                         Effervescence in Acid\r\n\r\nThis is a property that depends on the chemical composition of the\r\nmineral. Carbonate minerals, which contain (in addition to at least one\r\nother element) three parts of oxygen and one part of carbon, can be\r\ntested with dilute hydrochloric acid. When a drop or two of this acid is\r\nput on a carbonate mineral such as calcite (calcium carbonate, CaCO₃),\r\nthe acid begins to bubble and fizz. The fizzing or effervescence is\r\ncaused by the carbon dioxide gas that is formed when the acid and\r\nmineral come in contact with each other. This test is also helpful in\r\nidentifying rocks, such as limestone and marble, that contain carbonate\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SOME SPECIAL OCCURRENCES OF MINERALS\r\n\r\nCave Deposits\r\n\r\nBeautiful mineral deposits occur in some natural caves. Deposits that\r\nlook like icicles, called _stalactites_, are found hanging from the\r\nceiling of a cave. Other deposits, _stalagmites_, are like the\r\nstalactites except that they jut upward from the floor. _Columns_ are\r\nformed from stalactites and stalagmites that have joined together. In\r\naddition, some caves contain sheet-like deposits that are spread along\r\nthe ceiling, floor, and walls. These deposits are called _flowstone_.\r\nCalcite is one of the minerals that commonly form cave deposits.\r\n\r\nJust a few of the caves in Texas contain these deposits. They occur\r\nmostly in the limestone rocks that are south and southwest of the Llano\r\nuplift area of central Texas. Some of the commercial caves that contain\r\ngood examples of calcite deposits are located near Boerne in Kendall\r\nCounty and near Sonora in Sutton County. Calcite deposits also occur in\r\nLonghorn Cavern, a large cave located in the Longhorn Cavern State Park\r\nof Burnet County. These caves were formed by underground waters that\r\nmoved through cracks and pores in the limestone rocks and dissolved\r\npassageways in them. After the cave passages were made, water containing\r\ndissolved calcium carbonate dripped into the cave. As it evaporated,\r\nthis water left behind a deposit of calcium carbonate—the mineral\r\ncalcite.\r\n\r\nYou can better understand how the cave deposits are formed by watching\r\nicicles grow in wet, freezing weather. First, small hanging drops of\r\nwater freeze, and a small icicle forms. Then, as more water drips over\r\nit and freezes, the icicle grows longer and wider. Some of the water\r\ndrips completely over the icicle and falls to the ground. There, it\r\neither freezes into a sheet of ice, or it begins to build upward to form\r\nan upside-down icicle. The water dripping down in the caves evaporates\r\ninstead of freezing, and in doing so it leaves behind a deposit of\r\ncalcite.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Calcite stalactites and stalagmites in the Caverns of\r\n  Sonora, Sutton County, Texas.

These masses are called _concretions_. Concretions\r\nmay be round or oval, or they may have odd, irregular shapes. They—such\r\nas some of the limonite concretions of east Texas—even may look like\r\ngourds or sweet potatoes. Concretions generally are harder than the\r\nsurrounding rocks. Some are smaller than peas, but others are several\r\nfeet wide. (The word _nodule_ is used to describe small, rounded\r\nconcretions as well as other small, rounded mineral occurrences.)\r\n\r\nIt is believed that some concretions form at the same time as the rocks\r\nin which they occur. Other concretions develop after the rocks\r\nthemselves have formed. These are deposited by underground water that\r\ncontains dissolved mineral matter. The water seeps through the rocks and\r\ndeposits mineral matter around an object in the rock, such as a fossil\r\nor a grain of sand, to form a concretion.\r\n\r\n                                 Geodes\r\n\r\nGeodes are rounded, generally hollow masses that occur mostly in\r\nlimestones. They are scattered through the rocks and can be lifted or\r\ndug out. Some geodes are as small as walnuts, and some are as large as\r\nbasketballs. Most of them have a rough, dull-looking outer surface. If\r\nyou break geodes open, you will find that many are lined with beautiful\r\ncrystals of calcite, celestite, or quartz that point inward toward the\r\nhollow center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Calcite geode found in Lower Cretaceous strata of western\r\n                         Travis County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nIt is thought that a geode forms when water, carrying dissolved mineral\r\nmaterial, seeps into a cavity in the rock, then deposits the mineral\r\nmaterial as a lining in the cavity. This lining becomes the outer part\r\nof the geode. Thus a geode—unlike a concretion, which grows from the\r\ncenter outward—forms from outside to inside.\r\n\r\nSome of the Lower Cretaceous limestone rocks of Travis, Williamson, and\r\nLampasas counties contain calcite and celestite geodes. Celestite geodes\r\nhave also been found in Permian rocks in parts of Coke, Fisher, and\r\nNolan counties.\r\n\r\n                             Petrified Wood\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Petrified wood from Texas Gulf Coastal Plain.]\r\n\r\nWe often find some minerals occurring as petrified wood. (Petrified wood\r\nincludes silicified wood, opalized wood, agatized wood, and carbonized\r\nwood.) Petrified wood forms when plant material, such as a tree or a\r\nbush, is replaced by a mineral. It is formed by underground water\r\ncarrying dissolved mineral matter. As this water seeps through sediments\r\nin which the plants are buried, it gradually deposits agate, chalcedony,\r\ncalcite, opal, chalcocite, or some other mineral in the place of each\r\nfiber of the wood. By this slow change from plant to mineral matter, the\r\noriginal shape and structure of the wood remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nPetrified wood is commonly found in some of the Tertiary, Permian, and\r\nLower Cretaceous rocks of Texas. (_See_ Opal, Quartz, Copper Minerals,\r\npp. 78, 84, 52).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     COLLECTING ROCKS AND MINERALS\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps you would like to start your own collection of rocks and\r\nminerals. For this purpose you will need a _hammer_ (a prospector’s\r\nhammer with a pick on one end of it is a good tool), some _newspapers_\r\nto wrap around the specimens to keep them from breaking, and a _cloth\r\nbag_ in which to carry the specimens.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: Prospector’s hammer.]\r\n\r\nBefore you start to collect, be sure to ask the owner’s permission to go\r\non his property. If he agrees to let you come on his land, be careful\r\nabout closing gates, and do not leave holes into which his livestock\r\nmight step and be injured. Look out for snakes. Plenty of rattlers,\r\ncopperheads, and moccasins are still left in Texas. And, incidentally,\r\ncollecting is not allowed in State or National parks.\r\n\r\nTo identify the rocks and minerals that you collect, you probably will\r\nneed several articles with which to make simple tests. The following can\r\nbe easily obtained:\r\n\r\n  1. A _pocket knife_, a _copper penny_, a piece of _window glass_, a\r\n  _steel file_, and a piece of _quartz_ to test the hardness. If you\r\n  prefer to use a group of minerals of known hardness, such as those of\r\n  Mohs scale described on pages 16-17, you can either collect your own\r\n  or buy a prepared set from a mineral supply house.\r\n\r\n  2. A _streak plate_ to test the color of the mineral’s streak. Mineral\r\n  streak plates can be purchased, or a piece of unglazed tile can be\r\n  used.\r\n\r\n  3. A _magnifying glass_ to examine small cleavage surfaces, crystals,\r\n  and rock grains. A number of different kinds can be bought, from the\r\n  simple reading glass to the precisely made hand lens. A lens with\r\n  ten-power magnification is good for general use.\r\n\r\n  4. A small _magnet_ to test whether or not a mineral is magnetic.\r\n\r\n  5. _Dilute_ (10%) _hydrochloric acid_ (HCl), also known as _muriatic\r\n  acid_, to test carbonate rocks and minerals. You can buy a small\r\n  bottle at a drug store. Be extremely careful in handling this acid,\r\n  and keep it away from small children—it is a _POISON_. If you spill\r\n  any on yourself, it will burn your skin and eat holes in your clothes.\r\n\r\n                       [Illustration: Hand lens.]\r\n\r\nThe rock and mineral identification charts on pages 24-41 will help you\r\nto make the simple identification tests in a methodical way.\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to have some system of labeling your rock and mineral\r\nspecimens. Some collectors carry note paper with them on field trips.\r\nThen they can write down the location and, if possible, the name of the\r\nrock or mineral. This information is either wrapped with the specimen or\r\nstuck to it with tape. One way to label large collections is to put a\r\nsmall spot of paint or fingernail polish on each of the rock and mineral\r\nspecimens. When the paint has dried, a number can be written on it in\r\nblack India ink. Then, on a file card, the name and the number of the\r\nspecimen can be written, together with the place where it was found, the\r\ndate of collection, and the name of the collector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 ROCK AND MINERAL IDENTIFICATION CHARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo help you identify them, various Texas rocks and minerals are listed\r\ntogether in the following charts according to properties that they have\r\nin common. Although useful, the identification charts may not always\r\ngive you perfect results. For example, hardness, which is used as a\r\nguide, is not to be completely relied upon in the identification of\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nThe charts on the following pages pertain only to the rocks and minerals\r\nthat are described in this book. It is quite possible that you will find\r\nrocks and minerals in Texas that are not included in these charts.\r\n\r\nIf you find a rock or a mineral that you are unable to identify, you can\r\ncheck your local library for reference books that may aid you (several\r\nsuch references are noted on pages 100-101). If you need further help,\r\npossibly the science teacher at a nearby public school will be able to\r\nidentify the specimen for you. Or if a college or university is located\r\nin your area (especially one that has a department of geology), you can\r\nobtain help there. In Texas, the Bureau of Economic Geology is a mineral\r\ninformation center. Most other states have similar geological research\r\nand public-service organizations. Other sources of information might be\r\nthe gem and mineral societies that are found in a number of communities.\r\nMany of the members of these organizations are experts in the\r\nidentification of rocks and minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              How To Use the Mineral Identification Charts\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the mineral identification charts (pp. 26-38), the minerals have been\r\ngrouped, first of all, on the basis of _luster_: the first group\r\nincludes the minerals that appear _metallic_ and _almost metallic_\r\n(_submetallic_); the second group includes those that appear\r\n_nonmetallic_. Next, the minerals have been arranged within the two\r\ngroups according to _color_.\r\n\r\nAfter you have determined the luster and the color of an unknown\r\nmineral, turn to the _Key to Mineral Identification Charts_ on page 25.\r\nIt will direct you to the proper mineral chart.\r\n\r\nMineral Charts 1 through 5, which include the minerals of various colors\r\nwith _metallic_ and _submetallic_ lusters, are subdivided according to\r\nthe _hardness_ of the minerals. To determine the hardness of a mineral\r\nthat has one of these lusters, you can make the following tests:\r\n\r\n  1. Will the mineral readily leave a mark on paper?\r\n\r\n  2. If it will not readily leave a mark on paper, will an ordinary\r\n  pocket knife scratch it?\r\n\r\n  3. Is it too hard to be scratched by an ordinary pocket knife?\r\n\r\nMineral Charts 6 through 15 are for the _nonmetallic_ minerals of\r\nvarious colors. They, too, are subdivided according to the _hardness_ of\r\nthe minerals, as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. Can the mineral be scratched by a fingernail?\r\n\r\n  2. If it cannot be scratched by a fingernail, can it be scratched by a\r\n  copper penny?\r\n\r\n  3. If it cannot be scratched by a copper penny, can it be scratched by\r\n  an ordinary pocket knife?\r\n\r\n  4. If it cannot be scratched by an ordinary pocket knife, can it be\r\n  scratched by a piece of quartz?\r\n\r\n  5. Is it too hard to be scratched by quartz?\r\n\r\nWhen the luster, color, and hardness of a mineral have been determined,\r\nyou may find that several minerals on the charts fit the description. To\r\nnarrow your choice, you can then test other properties of the mineral.\r\nNotice the “remarks” column on the charts. In it, is mentioned anything\r\nthat is distinctive about the mineral.\r\n\r\nFor more complete mineral identification lists and tables, you can use\r\ntextbooks, such as _Dana’s Manual of Mineralogy_, revised by C. S.\r\nHurlbut, Jr., or _Mineralogy_, by E. H. Kraus, W. F. Hunt, and L. S.\r\nRamsdell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Key to Mineral Identification Charts\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the mineral has a _metallic_ or _submetallic_ luster,\r\n\r\n  and is:          Consult Mineral Chart\r\n  white            1\r\n  gray             2\r\n  yellow           3\r\n  brown            4\r\n  black            5\r\n\r\nIf the mineral has a _nonmetallic_ luster,\r\n\r\n  and is:          Consult Mineral Chart\r\n  white            6\r\n  gray             7\r\n  yellow           8\r\n  brown            9\r\n  black            10\r\n  green            11\r\n  blue             12\r\n  red or pink      13\r\n  purple or        14\r\n  violet\r\n  colorless        15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Mineral Identification Charts\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Chart    _Mineral_            _Streak_           _Remarks_       _Hardness_\r\n  No._\r\n\r\n  1.

In Rock Chart 2, the compact,\r\ndull, or stony rocks are arranged according to hardness as follows:\r\n\r\n  A. Rocks that can be scratched by a fingernail\r\n  B. Rocks that cannot be scratched by a fingernail but can be scratched\r\n          by an ordinary pocket knife\r\n  C. Rocks that cannot be scratched by an ordinary pocket knife\r\n\r\nIn Rock Chart 3, the granular rocks also are arranged according to\r\n_hardness_ into:\r\n\r\n  A. Rocks that can be scratched by an ordinary pocket knife\r\n  B. Rocks that cannot be scratched by an ordinary pocket knife\r\n    These harder rocks are subdivided into three groups:\r\n    1. Those that have grains of about equal size\r\n    2. Those with large easily seen grains that are scattered through a\r\n          mass of finer grains\r\n    3. Those rocks whose grains are arranged in layers\r\n\r\nIn the “remarks” column of the rock identification charts are included\r\nfurther tests that will aid you in identifying the rock.\r\n\r\nFor a more complete rock determination chart, you can consult a\r\ntextbook, such as _Rocks and Rock Minerals_, by L.

It has a\r\nglassy or a pearly luster and is transparent or translucent. Most\r\nanhydrite is white, but impurities cause it to be grayish, bluish, or\r\nreddish. When rubbed across a streak plate, anhydrite gives a white\r\nstreak. This mineral has an uneven fracture, and it cleaves in three\r\ndirections that are at right angles to each other. It commonly occurs as\r\nrectangular cleavage fragments or as sugary crystalline masses.\r\n\r\nAnhydrite resembles dolomite, limestone, or gypsum. You can use a\r\nhardness test to distinguish it from gypsum (anhydrite is harder) and an\r\nacid test to distinguish it from limestone and dolomite. A drop of\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid will fizz when you put it on limestone or\r\npowdered dolomite. On anhydrite, the acid does not fizz.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: Massive anhydrite.]\r\n\r\nAnhydrite occurs at several places in Texas. It is, for example, seen in\r\nbluffs along the Double Mountain Fork and the Salt Fork of the Brazos\r\nRiver in north-central Texas. Most of the Texas anhydrite, however,\r\noccurs underground. In the Gulf Coastal Plain, the anhydrite is found\r\nbelow the surface in salt domes. (Salt domes are described with halite\r\non p. 66 and with sulfur on p. 91.)\r\n\r\nAnother anhydrite locality is in the subsurface Permian basin of west\r\nTexas. Oil wells drilled in this basin penetrate great, thick deposits\r\nof massive anhydrite. The anhydrite was deposited during the Permian\r\nPeriod from a sea that covered this area. As the sea gradually\r\nevaporated, the mineral matter that was dissolved in it came out of\r\nsolution to form anhydrite, halite, and several other minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntigorite. _See_ Serpentine.\r\n\r\n\r\nArgentite. _See_ Silver Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Asbestos\r\n\r\n\r\nAsbestos is not really any one particular mineral. It is the name given\r\nto several minerals that occur in masses of slender, delicate fibers. In\r\nthe more typical kinds of asbestos, these fibers—when pulled\r\napart—resemble soft, fluffy, silk strings.\r\n\r\nSeveral small deposits of _amphibole asbestos_ have been found in the\r\nLlano uplift area of central Texas. This asbestos is a variety of the\r\nmineral _tremolite_, a calcium-magnesium silicate. It has fibers that\r\nbreak rather easily, and it has a silky luster. It is a shade of green\r\nor gray and gives a white streak when rubbed across a streak plate. When\r\nyou pull its fibers apart, you actually are breaking the mineral along\r\nits two directions of perfect cleavage. This amphibole asbestos is\r\nsofter than other varieties of the mineral tremolite—a copper penny\r\nscratches it easily.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Greenish, silky amphibole asbestos from northeastern\r\n                       Gillespie County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nThe asbestos occurs in veins in Precambrian metamorphic rocks in\r\nsouthern Llano County, northwestern Blanco County, and northeastern\r\nGillespie County. These deposits are small.\r\n\r\nA variety of the mineral _serpentine_ called _chrysotile asbestos_ is\r\nthe kind most used by industry. Its fibers are commonly flexible enough\r\nand strong enough to be woven into cloth. This cloth is made into\r\narticles, such as fireproof suits, gloves, and theater curtains. Some\r\nchrysotile has been found in Precambrian metamorphic rocks in\r\nnorthwestern Blanco County, but it does not break into fibers fine\r\nenough or flexible enough to be called asbestos.\r\n\r\n\r\nAzurite. _See_ Copper Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Barite\r\n\r\n\r\nBarite, barium sulfate, is a fairly common mineral in Texas. It has a\r\nglassy or a pearly luster, and it is transparent to translucent. Barite\r\nis colorless, white, brownish, bluish, yellowish, or reddish. When\r\nrubbed across a streak plate, it gives a white streak. It is not\r\nextremely hard—you can scratch it with a pocket knife, although not with\r\na fingernail.\r\n\r\nBarite is distinctive because of its weight and cleavage. It cleaves in\r\nthree directions, and some cleavage fragments are flat or platy. For a\r\nmineral with a nonmetallic luster, barite is heavy—it has a specific\r\ngravity of 4.5.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: Barite cleavage fragment from west Texas.]\r\n\r\nBarite commonly occurs as prism-shaped and as flat crystals, as granular\r\nmasses, as cleavable masses, and as rounded masses called _nodules_. In\r\nTexas, some of it was deposited in sedimentary rocks by underground\r\nwaters. As the waters seeped through these rocks, mineral matter came\r\nout of solution to form the barite. Some of the barite in Texas also\r\nformed from solutions that came from hot magmas.\r\n\r\nA number of barite deposits have been found in Texas, but many of them\r\nare small. Barite occurs in Precambrian metamorphic rocks in Gillespie\r\nand Llano counties, in Pennsylvanian shale in Brewster County, in\r\nPermian shales in Baylor and Taylor counties, and in Permian limestones\r\nin Culberson County. It is found in Triassic red shales in Howard County\r\nand in Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in Brewster, Brown, Hudspeth, Jeff\r\nDavis, Kinney, and Val Verde counties. In Live Oak County, barite occurs\r\nin Tertiary bentonitic clays. Barite is being mined from a deposit in\r\nthe Seven Heart Gap area northeast of Van Horn in Culberson County.\r\n\r\nBarite is used in a number of ways. It is a source of barium chemicals,\r\nand it also is powdered and used as an ingredient in paint. The oil\r\nindustry uses large amounts of barite. In drilling for oil by the rotary\r\nmethod, water and muds are pumped down the hole to aid drilling. Barite\r\nis added to these drilling fluids to make them heavy, since\r\nhigh-pressure gases are not as likely to blow heavy fluids out of the\r\nhole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Basalt\r\n\r\n\r\nBasalt is a heavy igneous rock that is black, dark gray, or dark brown.\r\nThis rock is made up chiefly of a feldspar mineral, such as\r\n_labradorite_, and a pyroxene mineral, such as _augite_. Other minerals\r\nmay be present.\r\n\r\nThe mineral grains of some basalts are so small that you cannot\r\ndistinguish them even with a magnifying glass. Other basalts, however,\r\nare _porphyritic_, which means that they contain larger, easily seen\r\ncrystals and grains of feldspar and pyroxene scattered either through a\r\nmass of the small mineral grains or through glassy material.\r\n\r\nSome basalts contain many small holes. These holes, called _vesicles_,\r\nwere formed when bubbles of gas were trapped in the hardening magma.\r\nLater, solutions moving through the rocks may have deposited another\r\nmineral—such as calcite or chalcedony—in some of the vesicles.\r\n\r\nBasalt forms from molten rock material that hardens either on or beneath\r\nthe surface—it can be extrusive or intrusive. Much of the basalt now\r\nfound in the Trans-Pecos country of west Texas formed from lava that\r\nflowed out onto the surface during the Tertiary Period. A few of the\r\nplaces where basalt occurs in west Texas are the Chinati Mountains of\r\nPresidio County, the Chisos Mountains of Brewster County, the Davis\r\nMountains of Jeff Davis County, and the Van Horn Mountains of Culberson\r\nand Hudspeth counties.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: Basalt from Brewster County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nSeveral varieties of basalt occur in the Balcones fault region of\r\nBandera, Comal, Hays, Kinney, Medina, Travis, and Uvalde counties. These\r\nbasalts formed from molten magma that forced its way into rocks just\r\nbelow the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nSome basalt, which is known commercially as _trap rock_, is produced in\r\nUvalde County. It is crushed and used for railroad ballast, road\r\nbuilding material, and as concrete aggregate.\r\n\r\n\r\nBentonite. _See_ Clay.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiotite. _See_ Mica.\r\n\r\n\r\nBraunite. _See_ Manganese Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Calcite\r\n\r\n\r\nCalcite, calcium carbonate, is one of the most abundant minerals in\r\nTexas. It is the chief mineral in limestone and in some marble. It also\r\nserves as the cementing material in many sandstones. Crystals, grains,\r\nand cleavable masses of calcite, which have been deposited by\r\nunderground water, occur in cracks and cavities in many of the igneous,\r\nmetamorphic, and sedimentary rocks of Texas. Calcite also occurs as\r\ncave, spring, and stream deposits and as caliche.\r\n\r\nCalcite is transparent or translucent, and—depending on the variety—its\r\nluster is glassy to earthy. Most calcite is white or colorless, but it\r\ncan be a shade of pink, blue, green, brown, yellow, or gray. It gives a\r\nwhite streak when you rub it across a streak plate.\r\n\r\nTwo properties of calcite to notice are the hardness and the cleavage.\r\nThis mineral cleaves perfectly in three directions that are not at right\r\nangles to each other, and some of the cleavage fragments are\r\nrhombohedrons. Calcite is rather soft—you can scratch it with a copper\r\npenny but not with a fingernail. A drop or two of dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid also will help you to identify this mineral. The acid will readily\r\nfizz and bubble when it is placed on calcite.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Calcite has perfect rhombohedral cleavage. The three\r\n     directions of cleavage are not at right angles to each other.]\r\n\r\nCalcite occurs in more different kinds of crystal shapes than any other\r\nmineral. Some of these crystals are flat and tabular; some are\r\nrhombohedrons; some are prisms. Pointed crystals, called _dog-tooth\r\nspar_, and twinned crystals have been found in the Terlingua area of\r\nBrewster County in west Texas. A somewhat unusual occurrence of calcite\r\ncrystals is in geodes. Some of these are found in Lower Cretaceous rocks\r\nwest of Austin in Travis County.\r\n\r\nTransparent crystals and cleavage fragments of calcite show a property\r\ncalled _double refraction_ (other minerals show it, too). To test this\r\nproperty, you can mark a single dot on paper. When you look at the dot\r\nthrough a piece of clear calcite, you will see two dots instead of one.\r\nThis happens because a ray of light is bent (refracted) and is split\r\ninto two rays as it enters the mineral. These two rays travel through\r\nthe calcite in slightly different directions, and each carries an image\r\nof the dot through the mineral. The two images that you see are at the\r\npoints where the two rays leave the calcite.\r\n\r\nCalcite that is deposited at springs, along river and creek banks, and\r\nin caves is known as _travertine_. Cave forms of travertine, including\r\nstalagmites and stalactites, occur in several caves in Texas. Another\r\nkind of travertine is called _calcareous tufa_ or _calcareous sinter_.\r\nIt is a porous and spongy-looking material deposited from water carrying\r\ndissolved limestone and is found around the openings of some springs and\r\nalong some creek and river banks.\r\n\r\nA dull, earthy calcite deposit, known as _caliche_, occurs in areas of\r\nTexas that have scant rainfall, such as the High Plains, west Texas, and\r\nthe southwestern part of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Caliche commonly is\r\nfound mixed with other materials, such as clay, sand, or gravel. This\r\nsubstance may be firm and compact or loose and powdery.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that caliche forms when ground moisture, containing\r\ndissolved calcium bicarbonate, moves upward. In dry areas of the\r\ncountry, this moisture evaporates. As it does, it leaves a crust of\r\ncalcium carbonate in the form of caliche on or near the surface of the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Calcite crystals (dog-tooth spar) from the Terlingua\r\n                    area of Brewster County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nCaliche is quarried in many counties in Texas and is used chiefly as\r\nroad material and as an aggregate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaliche. _See_ Calcite.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarnotite. _See_ Uranium Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Cassiterite\r\n\r\n\r\nCassiterite, tin dioxide, is the mineral that serves as the chief source\r\nof tin. Tin does not corrode and tarnish, and one of its main uses is in\r\nthe making of tin cans. (Actually, our tin cans are made from thin\r\nsheets of steel that have been coated with a protective layer of tin.)\r\n\r\nCassiterite has either a nonmetallic or a submetallic luster. Some\r\nspecimens are brilliant and shiny; others are dull. Cassiterite may be\r\ntranslucent to transparent. It may be black, brown, gray, reddish brown,\r\nor yellowish brown. When rubbed across a streak plate, this mineral\r\nleaves a pale brown, a pale yellow, or a white streak. Cassiterite is\r\nquite heavy—it has a specific gravity of 6.8 to 7.1. It is too hard to\r\nbe scratched by an average pocket knife.\r\n\r\nSometimes, prospectors use a chemical test to help them identify\r\ncassiterite. They put small pieces of metallic zinc into a jar or test\r\ntube containing dilute hydrochloric acid. Then they add a few fragments\r\nof the mineral that they suspect is cassiterite. If the fragments are\r\ncassiterite, they become covered with a pale gray coating of metallic\r\ntin.\r\n\r\nCassiterite’s most common crystal shape is a short, 8-sided prism with\r\npyramids at each end, but perfect crystals are not often found. Most\r\nTexas cassiterite does not show a crystal shape. Instead, it occurs as\r\ncrystalline masses in igneous rocks and as loose pebbles that have\r\nweathered out of these rocks.\r\n\r\nCassiterite occurs in a number of places in the United States but not in\r\nlarge quantities. A small amount of cassiterite has been found in quartz\r\nveins in Precambrian granite in both central Texas and west Texas. In El\r\nPaso County, the cassiterite is found on the east side of the Franklin\r\nMountains a few miles north of El Paso, where some of it has been mined.\r\nIn central Texas, cassiterite occurs in the Streeter area of Mason\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nWhen the granite rocks in these areas were formed, probably not all of\r\nthe hot magmas cooled and hardened at the same time. The fluids given\r\noff by the remaining magmas contained tin and several other elements. It\r\nis believed that these fluids moved up into cracks in the granite rocks\r\nand formed the cassiterite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Celestite\r\n\r\n\r\nCelestite is a strontium sulfate mineral. It is colorless, white,\r\nyellow, or gray. Light blue specimens of this mineral also are found,\r\nand it is because of this sky-like color that celestite gets its name.\r\nThe word celestite comes from the Latin word _caelestis_, meaning _of\r\nthe sky_.\r\n\r\nCelestite has a glassy to a pearly luster, and it is either transparent\r\nor translucent. It gives a white streak when rubbed across a streak\r\nplate. Celestite has a specific gravity of 3.95 to 3.97. It is, however,\r\nlighter than barite, a mineral that it resembles. Celestite is not very\r\nhard—a knife will scratch it, although your fingernail will not. It\r\ncleaves in three directions, and some of the fragments are flat and\r\nslabby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Celestite cleavage fragment from Lampasas County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nCelestite occurs commonly either as prism-shaped or flat crystals and as\r\ncleavable, granular, or fibrous crystalline masses. In Texas, it is\r\nfound in geodes, as rounded nodules, or as bedded or layer-like deposits\r\nin limestones and other sedimentary rocks. In Real County, celestite\r\noccurs on the walls of a cave in Cretaceous limestone.\r\n\r\nSome celestite may be deposited by sea water, but much of the Texas\r\ncelestite is believed to have been deposited by underground water that\r\nseeped through cracks and pores in the limestones and other sedimentary\r\nrocks. This water picked up and dissolved strontium compounds that were\r\nscattered in small amounts through the rocks. Then, it re-deposited the\r\nstrontium in the rocks as celestite.\r\n\r\nIn Texas, beds of celestite occur in Permian rocks in Coke, Fisher, and\r\nNolan counties and in Lower Cretaceous rocks in Brown, Comanche, and\r\nMills counties. Celestite geodes and nodules are found in Lower\r\nCretaceous limestone rocks in Lampasas, Travis, and Williamson counties,\r\nand in Permian rocks in Coke, Fisher, Nolan, and Taylor counties.\r\n\r\nCelestite is one of two minerals (the other mineral is _strontianite_,\r\nstrontium carbonate) used as a source of strontium. Strontium compounds\r\ngive a crimson-red color to a flame, so they are used in fireworks,\r\ntracer bullets, and flares. Perhaps you have seen a red flare set out on\r\nthe highway at night to warn motorists that a truck has stalled. The\r\nchances are good that the flare’s red flame was due to a strontium\r\ncompound. Some of the Texas celestite has been mined, but most of the\r\nstrontium minerals now used in the United States are imported from\r\nEngland and Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nCerargyrite. _See_ Silver Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\nChalcedony. _See_ Quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\nChalcocite. _See_ Copper Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\nChalcopyrite. _See_ Copper Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\nChalk. _See_ Limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\nChert (Flint). _See_ Quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\nChrysotile. _See_ Asbestos; Serpentine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Cinnabar\r\n\r\n\r\nCinnabar, which is mercuric sulfide, is the most common mercury mineral.\r\nIt has a dark red or a bright yellowish-red color and is transparent to\r\ntranslucent. When rubbed across a streak plate, it leaves a dark red\r\nstreak. If pure, cinnabar has a brilliant, shiny, nonmetallic luster. It\r\nis, however, commonly found mixed with impurities, such as clay,\r\ncalcite, iron oxide, or bituminous material, and then it looks dull and\r\nearthy. Cinnabar is quite heavy—it has a specific gravity of 8.10. It is\r\nrather soft, and you can scratch it with a copper penny.\r\n\r\nSome prospectors use a quick chemical test to identify cinnabar. They\r\nrub a clean, shiny copper coin with a mineral sample that has been\r\nmoistened with a drop or two of dilute hydrochloric acid. If the sample\r\nis cinnabar, a light silvery-gray coating appears on the coin.\r\n\r\nCinnabar occurs as small crystals or as fine-grained or compact\r\ncrystalline masses. It is found in veins that fill cracks in rocks and\r\nalso occurs as crusts and coatings on rocks. It also may be widely\r\nscattered through rocks, such as limestones.\r\n\r\nCinnabar occurs in the Terlingua area of Brewster and Presidio counties\r\nin west Texas. It has been mined there, off and on, since about 1894,\r\nand during this time, mercury worth many millions of dollars has been\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nMost of this west Texas cinnabar is found in cracks, pores, and\r\nbreccia-filled cavities of Cretaceous limestones and clays. If you will\r\nlook at the Texas geologic map (pp. 4-5), you will see that igneous\r\nrocks occur in this district. Many millions of years ago during the\r\nTertiary Period, when these igneous rocks were still hot magma, some of\r\nthem pushed up under the Cretaceous rocks and emitted fluids containing\r\nmercury. The fluids moved upward through cracks and pores in the\r\nCretaceous rocks where they deposited the mercury as cinnabar and as\r\nother mercury minerals.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Cinnabar crystals (dark) with calcite crystals (white)\r\n          from the Terlingua area of Brewster County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nMercury is an unusual element. Instead of occurring as a solid metal at\r\nordinary room temperatures, as do gold, silver, and lead, it remains a\r\nliquid until it is cooled to 38 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. Because\r\nthe silvery little drops of liquid mercury roll about as if they were\r\nalive, this element long has been called _quicksilver_.\r\n\r\nMercury is used in a variety of ways. In some noiseless light-switches,\r\na glass tube containing a small ball of mercury tilts when the switch is\r\nturned “on.” The mercury then rolls to the end of the tube that contains\r\nelectrical contacts and quietly completes the electrical circuit. In\r\nother uses, mercury is added to silver, tin, and other metals to make\r\nfillings for teeth. Some medicines, such as calomel and mercurochrome,\r\ncontain mercury. Fulminate of mercury helps to set off dynamite and\r\nother explosives. Mercury is used in many barometers and thermometers,\r\nand farmers use mercury poisons to control insects and fungi.\r\n\r\nMercury also commonly is used to obtain gold from its ores. One method\r\nof accomplishing this is to pass wet gold-bearing gravel or crushed rock\r\nover metal plates that are coated with mercury. The gold particles\r\nquickly mix with the mercury to form an _amalgam_, which later can be\r\nscraped off the plates. The gold is then recovered by heating the\r\namalgam to drive off the mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Clay\r\n\r\n\r\nClay is a smooth, soft, earthy rock made up of mineral particles no\r\nbigger than specks of dust. Some of the particles are clay minerals,\r\nwhich consist of aluminum, silicon, and other elements. In addition,\r\ntiny particles of quartz, calcite, and other minerals may also be\r\npresent in the clay.\r\n\r\nThe clay particles are all that remain of rocks and of minerals, such as\r\nfeldspar, that have been broken into fragments or altered into clay\r\nminerals by weathering. Some clay remains at the place where it formed,\r\nbut some is carried away and deposited elsewhere.\r\n\r\nClay is white, tan, brown, red, green, blue, gray—almost any color. When\r\nmoist, it has an earthy odor. You can moisten a piece of clay enough to\r\nnotice this just by breathing on it. Most clays, when wet, can be molded\r\ninto many different shapes—that is, they are plastic, but when they are\r\ndry, they are firm and solid.\r\n\r\nClay is abundant in Texas and has a number of uses. Some goes to make\r\nportland cement, and some is baked or burned in a kiln to make brick,\r\ntile, sewer pipes, pottery, and other products. This kind of clay is\r\nobtained from Tertiary formations of the Gulf Coastal Plain, from Upper\r\nCretaceous formations in central Texas, and from Pennsylvanian\r\nformations in north-central Texas. (You can locate Tertiary, Cretaceous,\r\nand Pennsylvanian rocks on the Texas geologic map, pp. 4-5.)\r\n\r\nA special kind of white burning clay that can be used to make chinaware\r\nis called _kaolin_ or _china clay_. It contains particles of the clay\r\nmineral _kaolinite_ as well as several other clay minerals. Deposits of\r\nchina clay occur in southern Jeff Davis County and in Real County near\r\nLeakey, but none is being produced.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of clay, _bentonite_, forms from weathered volcanic ash.\r\nBentonite contains the clay mineral _montmorillonite_ and looks smooth\r\nand soap-like. Fresh samples of this clay are white, pale green, or pale\r\nblue, but dried-out or weathered samples are tan, brown, yellow, or\r\nreddish. When wet, bentonite absorbs water, swells, and then has a\r\njelly-like appearance.\r\n\r\nSurface deposits of bentonite occur chiefly in Eocene Tertiary\r\nformations of the Gulf Coastal Plain, in Cretaceous formations of the\r\nBig Bend area of west Texas, and in Quaternary formations of the High\r\nPlains.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Bentonite is used as a drilling-fluid additive in the\r\n           rotary method of drilling for petroleum and gas.]\r\n\r\nSome bentonite is used to absorb unwanted coloring material in petroleum\r\nand in vegetable oils. It is then known as a _bleaching clay_. Bentonite\r\nbleaching clay is obtained from some of the Tertiary formations along\r\nthe Texas Gulf Coastal Plain. It has been produced in Angelina, Fayette,\r\nGonzales, Jasper, Walker, and other counties in this area.\r\n\r\nAnother important use of bentonite, and of other clay, too, is as\r\n_drilling mud_. In the rotary method of drilling for oil and gas, mud is\r\npumped down into the drilled hole. This mud carries the rock cuttings up\r\nto the surface, it cools the drilling tools, and it coats and seals the\r\nwalls of the hole. Along the Gulf Coastal Plain, drilling clay is\r\nobtained from Tertiary formations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon Opal. _See_ Opal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Copper Minerals (Chalcocite, Chalcopyrite, Malachite, Azurite)\r\n\r\n\r\nA number of minerals containing copper, such as _chalcocite_,\r\n_chalcopyrite_, _malachite_, and _azurite_, occur in small deposits in\r\nTexas. They are found chiefly in the Llano uplift area of central Texas,\r\nin the Van Horn area of Culberson and Hudspeth counties in west Texas,\r\nand in a group of counties in north-central Texas.\r\n\r\nCopper is an important element. Because it is an unusually good\r\nconductor of electricity (only silver, which costs much more, is a\r\nbetter one), it is used for many kinds of wires for switchboards,\r\ngenerators, motors, telephone and telegraph equipment, and light and\r\npower lines.\r\n\r\nManufacturers commonly combine copper with other elements. For example,\r\nsome copper is mixed with zinc to make _brass_ and with tin and a little\r\nzinc to make _bronze_. These mixtures are called _alloys_. Many products\r\nare made from copper alloys, including tubing, pipes, jewelry, pots, and\r\npans. Even our coins contain copper.\r\n\r\nSometimes, a prospector uses a chemical test to find out if copper is\r\npresent in a mineral. First, he crushes a small sample of what he\r\nbelieves is a copper mineral (such as chalcocite, chalcopyrite, azurite,\r\nor malachite). He then puts the sample in a glass jar or test tube and\r\npours in a small amount of dilute nitric acid (this acid, like\r\nhydrochloric acid, is poisonous). After the sample has dissolved in the\r\nacid, he adds enough ammonium hydroxide to make the solution alkaline.\r\nIf the sample is a copper mineral, the solution turns a deep-blue color.\r\n\r\nOne of the copper minerals, _chalcocite_, copper sulfide, also is known\r\nas _copper glance_. It is a metallic mineral that commonly tarnishes to\r\na dull black. By chipping off a fragment to obtain a fresh surface, you\r\nwill see that it has a shiny lead-gray color. Chalcocite is rather soft,\r\nand it is sectile, that is, a knife will cut through it as well as\r\nscratch it. When you rub chalcocite across a streak plate, it gives a\r\ngrayish-black streak. This mineral commonly occurs as compact masses or\r\nas granular masses.\r\n\r\nChalcocite, with its dark color, does not look at all like copper, which\r\nis a bright reddish brown. Chalcocite, however, is the chief copper\r\nmineral at the most important copper mine in Texas, the Hazel mine,\r\nwhich is about 15 miles northwest of Van Horn in Culberson County in\r\nwest Texas. This mine, although now idle and almost filled with water,\r\nhas produced about one and a half million pounds of copper along with\r\nmore valuable silver ores. Here, the chalcocite and other minerals occur\r\nin material that fills large cracks in red sandstone of the Precambrian\r\nHazel Formation. It is thought that long ago, molten igneous rock\r\nmaterial far below the surface sent out hot solutions containing copper\r\nand other elements. These solutions moved upward and deposited minerals\r\nin the fracture zone in the sandstone.\r\n\r\nChalcocite occurs also in north-central Texas. It is found in Archer,\r\nBaylor, Clay, Foard, Hardeman, King, Knox, Stonewall, and several other\r\ncounties of this area. Here, it occurs in Permian sedimentary rocks\r\n(called “red beds”) as rounded masses, as scattered grains, and as\r\npetrified wood. Because these deposits are far from any igneous rocks,\r\nthey apparently did not form in the same way as those at the Hazel mine.\r\nThese north-central Texas deposits have never really been commercially\r\ndeveloped. During the Civil War, however, some copper from this area was\r\nmade into percussion caps for the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Hazel copper-silver mine, Culberson County, Texas, as\r\n            it appeared in 1951. Photograph by P. T. Flawn.]\r\n\r\nAnother copper mineral, _chalcopyrite_, is a copper-iron sulfide. It\r\nalso is known as _copper pyrites_ and _yellow copper ore_. This mineral\r\nhas a metallic luster and a brass-yellow or a golden-yellow color. When\r\nrubbed across a streak plate, it gives a greenish-black streak.\r\nChalcopyrite will tarnish and then has bronze, blue, purple, and other\r\nrainbow-like colors. This mineral is fairly soft—you can scratch it with\r\na pocket knife. Because of chalcopyrite’s yellow color, it has often\r\nbeen mistaken for gold. For this reason, it, like iron pyrite, is often\r\ncalled _fool’s gold_. (See Gold, p. 60, for ways to tell them apart.)\r\n\r\nChalcopyrite commonly is found in compact masses that show no crystal\r\nshapes. These masses either are scattered through rocks or occur in\r\nmaterial that fills cracks in rocks.\r\n\r\nSome chalcopyrite is found in Precambrian sandstone at the Hazel mine\r\nand in other deposits in the Van Horn area of Culberson and Hudspeth\r\ncounties. It also occurs in Precambrian rocks at the Sheridan and\r\nPavitte prospects in Burnet County. These chalcopyrite localities are in\r\ndistricts where igneous rocks occur.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that, long ago, hot solutions containing copper moved\r\nupward, out of deeply buried molten magma. While still far below the\r\nsurface, the solutions deposited the chalcopyrite in cracks and other\r\nopenings in the nearby rocks.\r\n\r\nTwo copper minerals of Texas, _azurite_ and _malachite_, are copper\r\ncarbonates. Azurite is commonly called _chessylite_ and _blue copper_;\r\nmalachite is called _green copper carbonate_. Because these minerals are\r\ncarbonates, a drop of dilute hydrochloric acid will fizz and bubble when\r\nplaced on either of them.\r\n\r\nAzurite has a bright, intense blue color and leaves a blue streak when\r\nrubbed across a streak plate. Malachite has a bright green color and\r\nleaves a green streak. These minerals have a nonmetallic luster and a\r\nglassy to dull appearance. Commonly, they are translucent, although some\r\nspecimens of azurite are transparent. Both azurite and malachite are\r\nfairly soft—a pocket knife will scratch them, but a copper penny will\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nAzurite and malachite occur as individual crystals, but you are more\r\nlikely to find them as crusts on rocks and on other minerals. Malachite\r\nis also found in rounded fibrous masses that resemble bunches of grapes\r\n(described then as _botryoidal_).\r\n\r\nBoth azurite and malachite are formed in the same way. Underground\r\nwaters seep through rocks that contain deposits of copper minerals (such\r\nas chalcocite and chalcopyrite) and cause chemical reactions which\r\nchange these minerals into malachite and azurite.\r\n\r\nMalachite is more plentiful than azurite, but both minerals can be found\r\ntogether. You can expect to find at least one of them at the same\r\nlocalities where chalcocite, chalcopyrite, and other copper minerals\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoquina. _See_ Limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiatomite. _See_ Opal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Dolomite\r\n\r\n\r\nDolomite is the name given both to a rock and to a mineral. The mineral\r\nis a calcium-magnesium carbonate and has a glassy or a pearly luster. It\r\nis any of a number of colors, such as white, pink, brown, or gray, or it\r\ncan be colorless. Dolomite leaves a white streak on a streak plate and\r\nis transparent to translucent. It is not particularly hard and can be\r\nscratched with a pocket knife, although not with a copper penny.\r\nDolomite cleaves perfectly in three directions, and some of the cleavage\r\nfragments are rhombohedrons. However, the cleavages of the individual\r\nmineral grains in specimens of fine-grained massive dolomite are not\r\nreadily distinguishable.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Dolomite rock from the vicinity of Fairland, Burnet\r\n                            County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nMost Texas dolomite occurs as coarse-, medium-, and fine-grained\r\ncrystalline masses as the chief mineral in dolomite rock and in\r\ndolomitic marble. It is also found as 6-sided crystals that are\r\nrhomb-shaped; when the faces are curved, they have a saddle-like\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nCrystals of the mineral dolomite commonly occur in cavities in the\r\ndolomite rocks. It is believed that they were deposited there by seeping\r\nunderground waters. The waters dissolved some of the dolomite in the\r\nrocks and then re-deposited it as crystals.\r\n\r\nDolomite rock is made up mostly of crystalline grains of the mineral\r\ndolomite. In addition, quartz grains, calcite, and other minerals may be\r\npresent. Dolomite rock is almost any color—white, buff, pink brown,\r\ngray. It resembles some limestone, and these two rocks actually are\r\nclosely related.\r\n\r\nTo help tell them apart, dilute hydrochloric acid often is used. A few\r\ndrops of this acid will readily fizz and bubble if the rock you put them\r\non is a limestone. If the rock is dolomite, the acid will effervesce\r\nonly very little or not at all. (If, however, the acid is put on\r\npowdered dolomite, it then will fizz readily.) Dolomite is slightly\r\nharder than limestone, and it also is slightly heavier.\r\n\r\nSome dolomite rocks formed directly from materials that were dissolved\r\nin sea water, and others are altered limestone rocks. Some limestones\r\naltered into dolomite on the sea floor by the addition of magnesium from\r\nthe sea water. Others changed into dolomite much later after the sea had\r\nwithdrawn and the limestones had become a part of the land; underground\r\nwaters containing magnesium seeped through these limestones and altered\r\nthem into dolomite.\r\n\r\nMany of the dolomite rocks are found with limestones. In Texas they\r\noccur mostly in Cambrian, Ordovician, Mississippian, Pennsylvanian,\r\nPermian, and Cretaceous formations. The geologic map (pp. 4-5) indicates\r\nwhere these strata appear at the surface in Texas.\r\n\r\nDolomite is abundant in the Llano uplift area of central\r\nTexas—particularly in the Cambrian and Ordovician rocks. A number of\r\nthese central Texas dolomites have been quarried for use as building\r\nstones. Some of them also have been crushed and used as a road-building\r\nmaterial and as a stone aggregate that is mixed with cement to make\r\nconcrete. This dolomite is also used as terrazzo chips (terrazzo floors\r\nare described with serpentine on p. 88). In addition, Ellenburger\r\n(Ordovician) dolomite from Burnet County was used during World War II as\r\na source of the lightweight metal magnesium.\r\n\r\n\r\nDravite. _See_ Tourmaline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Feldspar\r\n\r\n\r\nFeldspar is the name given to a group of nonmetallic minerals that are\r\nmuch alike. Several of them are so similar that a petrographic\r\nmicroscope must be used to tell them apart. Each of the feldspar\r\nminerals is an aluminum silicate. Each of them contains, in addition, at\r\nleast one of the following elements: potassium, sodium, calcium, and\r\nbarium. The feldspar minerals that are found in Texas include _albite_,\r\na sodium-aluminum silicate, and _orthoclase_ and _microcline_, which are\r\nboth potassium-aluminum silicates.\r\n\r\nThe feldspar minerals are transparent to translucent and have either\r\nglassy or pearly lusters. They can be white, cream, or a shade of red,\r\nbrown, yellow, blue, gray, or green. When you rub a feldspar across a\r\nstreak plate, it leaves a white streak. The feldspars are rather hard—a\r\npocket knife will not scratch them, although a piece of quartz or a\r\nsteel file will. These minerals have good cleavage in two directions.\r\nThe cleavages meet at an angle of about 90°, so that the cleavage\r\nfragments have square corners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Feldspar cleavage fragment from Llano County, Texas. The\r\n    two directions of good cleavage meet at an angle of about 90°.]\r\n\r\nThe feldspars are important rock-forming minerals. You can find them in\r\nigneous rocks, such as granite or pegmatite, and in metamorphic rocks,\r\nsuch as gneiss. They also occur as fragments in sedimentary rocks, such\r\nas some sandstone and conglomerate.\r\n\r\nAlthough the feldspars can originate in other ways, they form mostly\r\nfrom hot magmas that cool and crystallize into igneous rocks. These\r\nminerals occur in the rocks as grains, as cleavable masses, and as\r\nindividual crystals. The crystals may be shaped like prisms, or they may\r\nbe flat and slabby.\r\n\r\nGood places to look for feldspars are in areas where granites,\r\npegmatites, and other intrusive igneous rocks appear at the surface. The\r\npegmatite rocks of Burnet, Gillespie, Llano, and Mason counties in the\r\nLlano uplift area of central Texas, and those of the Van Horn Mountains\r\nin Hudspeth and Culberson counties in west Texas, are especially good\r\nsources of feldspar. Large cleavable masses and crystals that are more\r\nthan a foot long are found in some of these rocks.\r\n\r\nThe feldspars have a number of uses. Some of the pegmatite feldspars\r\nfrom Llano County in central Texas have been crushed and used as\r\ngranules for built-up and composition roofs. In addition, some have been\r\nshipped to Mexico for glass-making. Some of the other uses of feldspar\r\nare in making porcelain, ceramic glazes, and scouring compounds. A few\r\nof the feldspar minerals, such as the variety of microcline known as\r\n_amazonstone_, are used as gemstones.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Microcline feldspar crystals from near Granite Shoals\r\n                      Lake, Llano County, Texas.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFibrous Gypsum. _See_ Gypsum.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlint. _See_ Quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Fluorite\r\n\r\n\r\nFluorite is calcium fluoride. The fluorite that is mined and sent to\r\nmarket, however, commonly is found mixed with quartz, calcite,\r\nlimestone, or other rocks and minerals. Industry calls this mixture\r\n_fluorspar_.\r\n\r\nFluorite is a transparent to translucent mineral that has a glassy\r\nluster. It may be colorless, or it may be white, pink, green, purple,\r\nbrown, or blue. Some specimens show more than one color. When you rub\r\nfluorite across a streak plate, it leaves a white streak. This mineral\r\nis not particularly hard—a pocket knife will scratch it, although a\r\ncopper penny will not. Fluorite has perfect cleavage in four directions.\r\nBy carefully breaking a specimen, you can obtain cleavage fragments that\r\nare shaped like octahedrons.\r\n\r\nFluorite occurs as cleavable masses, as fine or coarse grains, and as\r\ncrystals. Most of the crystals are cubes, but some may be octahedrons,\r\ndodecahedrons, or combinations of these.\r\n\r\nFluorite has been found both in west Texas and in central Texas. In the\r\nLlano uplift area of central Texas, it occurs in a number of Precambrian\r\ngranite, pegmatite, schist, and gneiss rocks. The most important,\r\nalthough small, deposit in this area is near Spring Creek a few miles\r\nwest of Burnet in Burnet County. Here, prospectors have dug holes and\r\npits in gneiss and schist rocks and found layers of fluorite in them.\r\n\r\nThe largest known fluorite deposits in Texas (they are not particularly\r\nlarge when you compare them with the deposits in Illinois and Kentucky)\r\nare those in the Eagle Mountains of Hudspeth County. This fluorite\r\noccurs in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Many years ago, probably\r\nduring the late part of the Tertiary Period, hot magma far below the\r\nsurface gave off liquids and gases containing fluorine. These fluids\r\nmoved up through large cracks (called faults) in Cretaceous limestones\r\nand Tertiary igneous rocks and deposited fluorite in them. In places,\r\nbeds of limestone have been replaced by fluorite. Some of this west\r\nTexas fluorite has been mined and shipped to market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fluorite has octahedral cleavage. The four directions of\r\nperfect cleavage can result in cleavage fragments that are octahedrons.]\r\n\r\nFluorite is extremely important as a flux in steel-making to help the\r\ningredients of the molten steel blend together. In addition, it combines\r\nwith sulfur, phosphorus, and other unwanted substances so that they can\r\nbe removed from the steel. Other important uses of fluorite are in\r\nglass-making and in the manufacture of hydrofluoric acid. This acid is\r\nused in the aluminum industry as well as in industries that make\r\nhigh-octane gasoline, insecticides, and refrigerants for refrigerators\r\nand freezers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Galena\r\n\r\n\r\nGalena, lead sulfide, is a shiny, lead-gray, metallic mineral that has a\r\nspecific gravity of 7.4 to 7.6. It is soft enough to mark paper, and it\r\nleaves a grayish-black streak on a streak plate. This mineral cleaves\r\nperfectly in three directions, and the cleavage fragments have square\r\ncorners—some are cubes.\r\n\r\nGalena occurs as cleavable masses, as fine or coarse grains, and as\r\ncrystals, most of which are cubes. Galena commonly is associated with\r\nother minerals; for example, some of the west Texas galena either\r\ncontains some silver (then called _argentiferous galena_) or occurs with\r\nit. Sphalerite, a zinc mineral, is commonly found with galena.\r\n\r\nGalena is an important mineral because it is the chief source of lead.\r\nCompounds of lead, called white lead, red lead, and litharge, are used\r\nas paint pigments. Automobile batteries contain lead plates, and\r\ntetraethyl lead is added to gasoline to keep the car’s motor from\r\nknocking. Some other uses of lead are in bullets, type metal, solder,\r\nand cable coverings.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Galena has perfect cubic cleavage. The three directions\r\n    of cleavage are at right angles to each other resulting in cubic\r\n                          cleavage fragments.]\r\n\r\nGalena has been found in several areas of Texas and has been mined in\r\ncentral and west Texas. None, however, has been produced in recent\r\nyears. Most of the galena mined in west Texas was obtained from silver\r\nmines, where the galena was a by-product. Some of the west Texas galena\r\ndeposits are at Altuda Mountain east of Alpine in Brewster County, in\r\nthe Eagle Mountains and the Quitman Mountains in Hudspeth County, and in\r\nthe Chinati Mountains and the Shafter area in Presidio County. Most of\r\nthe mining has been from the Shafter area (this area is described with\r\nsilver minerals on p. 90).\r\n\r\nIn central Texas, several small galena deposits have been found in\r\nBlanco, Burnet, and other counties of the Llano uplift area. Some galena\r\nhas been mined at Silver Creek in northwestern Burnet County. Here,\r\ngalena occurs in cracks and as scattered grains in Cambrian limestones\r\nand sandstones.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that much of the galena in west Texas and in central\r\nTexas was formed when hot magma forced out solutions containing lead.\r\nThese solutions moved up through cracks and other openings in the\r\nsubsurface rocks and deposited the galena in them.\r\n\r\nSmall amounts of galena, which likely had a different origin, have been\r\nfound in Fisher, Foard, Hardeman, and Young counties. A little occurs\r\nalso in rocks associated with salt in a number of the Gulf Coastal Plain\r\nsalt domes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Garnet\r\n\r\n\r\nGarnet is not one mineral but is the name given to a group of several\r\nminerals that are very much alike. In fact, it often is impossible to\r\ntell some of them apart without using special laboratory tests.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Garnet crystal forms include: A, trapezohedron; B,\r\n  dodecahedron; C and D, combination trapezohedron and dodecahedron.]\r\n\r\nThe garnet minerals have glassy to resinous lusters and are transparent\r\nor translucent. A pocket knife will not scratch them, and some specimens\r\nare too hard even for quartz to scratch. Two of the garnet minerals most\r\ncommonly found in Texas are _almandite_, an iron-aluminum silicate, and\r\n_grossularite_, a calcium-aluminium silicate. Almandite has a deep-red\r\nor a brownish-red color. Grossularite is pale green, brownish yellow,\r\ncinnamon brown, or rose red.\r\n\r\nGarnet minerals occur as crystals and as masses that are scattered\r\nthrough some of the metamorphic and igneous rocks. After they have\r\nweathered out of these rocks, the garnets make up a part of many sands\r\nand sandstones. Because these minerals so commonly occur as crystals, it\r\nis helpful to learn to recognize the crystal shapes.\r\n\r\nGarnet minerals are found in the igneous and metamorphic rocks of both\r\ncentral Texas and west Texas. In central Texas, they occur in ancient\r\nPrecambrian schist and pegmatite rocks of the Llano uplift area. Some of\r\nthese central Texas garnet localities are in northeastern Mason County,\r\ncentral and northwestern Llano County, west-central Burnet County, and\r\nnortheastern Gillespie County.\r\n\r\nIn west Texas, garnets occur in metamorphic rocks in the Quitman\r\nMountains, which are southwest of Sierra Blanca in Hudspeth County, and\r\nin the Mica Mine area, which is south of Van Horn near the\r\nHudspeth-Culberson County line. Garnets also have been found in igneous\r\nrocks in the Franklin Mountains a few miles north of El Paso in El Paso\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nGarnets that are found in metamorphic rocks such as schists were formed\r\nwhen great forces squeezed and heated rocks far below the earth’s\r\nsurface. This heat and pressure caused elements in the rocks to join\r\ntogether into different combinations to form new minerals, such as\r\ngarnets. Garnets that occur scattered through igneous rocks, such as\r\nsome pegmatites and granites, cooled and crystallized from hot, igneous\r\nfluids when the rocks themselves formed.\r\n\r\nMost Texas garnets are not transparent. A few, however, are clear enough\r\nto be used as gemstones. These can be cut, polished, and mounted in\r\nrings, brooches, bracelets, and earrings. Although some garnet is widely\r\nused as an abrasive, none from Texas has been produced for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Gneiss\r\n\r\n\r\nGneiss is a metamorphic rock that has parallel layers or bands. Some\r\ngneiss is made up of the same minerals (chiefly feldspar and quartz) as\r\ngranite, and it is then called _granite gneiss_. Several of the other\r\nkinds of gneiss are known as _mica gneiss_, _conglomerate gneiss_,\r\n_gabbro gneiss_, and _hornblende gneiss_. In order to be a gneiss, a\r\nmetamorphic rock has to have bands or layers. These bands may be either\r\nstraight or wavy and either wide or narrow. In most gneisses, you will\r\nfind a layer made up of long or flat mineral grains next to a layer made\r\nup of the grains of an entirely different mineral. The bands may show\r\ncolor differences, too. For example, a pink layer made up of feldspar\r\ngrains may be found next to a black layer made up of hornblende grains.\r\nThe mineral grains interlock as they do in igneous rocks, and they are\r\ngenerally large enough to be seen without a magnifying glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gneiss from Blanco County, Texas, showing light and dark\r\n                                bands.]\r\n\r\nGneiss can form from an igneous rock, such as granite, or from a\r\nsedimentary rock, such as sandstone. Heat, fluids, and pressures below\r\nthe earth’s surface change these rocks into gneiss.\r\n\r\nGneiss that formed during Precambrian time is now seen at the surface in\r\nboth west Texas and central Texas. In west Texas, it occurs principally\r\nin the Van Horn area of Culberson and Hudspeth counties. In central\r\nTexas, it is found in Blanco, Burnet, Gillespie, Llano, and Mason\r\ncounties of the Llano uplift area.\r\n\r\nOne of the Llano uplift rocks is called the Valley Spring Gneiss. It\r\ngenerally has a light color (much of it is pinkish), and it is believed\r\nto have once been a sandstone. Another gneiss of this area, the Big\r\nBranch Gneiss, which has a medium to dark gray color, occurs in northern\r\nGillespie and Blanco counties and is an altered igneous rock. Some of\r\nthe Texas gneiss rocks are suitable for use as building stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Gold\r\n\r\n\r\nGold commonly occurs in nature as a single element—gold—but much native\r\ngold has a small amount of some other element, such as silver, copper,\r\nor iron, mixed with it.\r\n\r\nNative gold is a shiny, yellow, metallic mineral that does not tarnish,\r\nand it leaves a shiny, golden-yellow streak when you rub it across a\r\nstreak plate. If silver is present, the color and streak have a lighter\r\nshade. Pure gold is extremely heavy—its specific gravity is 19.3.\r\nBecause it is malleable, this mineral will flatten into a thin sheet\r\nwhen hammered. It is ductile enough to be drawn out into wires. Gold is\r\nalso soft—a pocket knife will scratch it easily. When it is to be used\r\nfor ornaments and jewelry, gold is usually mixed with other metal, such\r\nas silver, copper, nickel, or palladium, to make it harder. The amount\r\nof gold that is present is then indicated by _carats_ (or _karats_).\r\nPure gold is 24 carats. If you have a gold ring that has _14 K_ stamped\r\ninside it, you know that it is made of a mixture of 14 parts gold and 10\r\nparts of other metal.\r\n\r\nGold commonly occurs in nature as plates, scales, or grains. Some of the\r\ngrains are large enough to be called _nuggets_. It also is found in a\r\nwire-like shape described as _filiform_, it occurs in a network, called\r\n_reticulate_, and it can have a branching and fern-like shape, described\r\nas _dendritic_. Gold is not often found as individual crystals.\r\n\r\nSeveral other minerals, such as pyrite, chalcopyrite, and mica, are\r\nsometimes mistaken for gold. None of these, however, is malleable and\r\nductile, and none is nearly as heavy as gold. Pyrite and chalcopyrite\r\nhave dark-colored streaks unlike that of gold. Mica cleaves so perfectly\r\nthat it can be split into thin, flat sheets, but gold has no cleavage at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe best places to look for gold are in areas near igneous rocks and\r\nalong the creeks and rivers that drain these areas. It is thought that\r\nmost gold originally was carried up from molten igneous rock by hot\r\nsolutions. The solutions moved into cracks and other openings in nearby\r\nrocks and deposited the gold, commonly along with quartz. Later, some of\r\nthese gold-bearing rocks weathered away. The gold that the rocks\r\ncontained either remained at the spot or was washed into creeks and\r\nrivers. These transported accumulations of loose gold are called _placer\r\ndeposits_.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Placer gold in very small quantities has been found in\r\n                 some of the stream gravels of Texas.]\r\n\r\nNo really important gold deposit has ever been found in Texas, although\r\ntraces and small amounts have been reported in several areas. A little\r\ngold has been found in the Llano uplift area of central Texas. It occurs\r\nin quartz veinlets that cut through some of the Precambrian metamorphic\r\nrocks of Llano, Mason, northeastern Gillespie, and west-central Burnet\r\ncounties. Many years ago, a small amount of gold was mined northeast of\r\nLlano in Llano County from the Heath mine. Some gold also has been found\r\nin sands and gravels along streams, such as along Sandy Creek and its\r\ntributaries, in parts of this Llano uplift area.\r\n\r\nIn the Trans-Pecos country of west Texas, small amounts of gold have\r\nbeen found in the Van Horn area of Culberson and Hudspeth counties, in\r\nthe Quitman Mountains district of Hudspeth County, and in the country\r\naround Shafter in Presidio County. Most of the small quantity of gold\r\nthat was mined in west Texas was obtained as a by-product from the\r\nPresidio mine in the Shafter district (described with silver minerals on\r\np. 90).\r\n\r\nSmall amounts of gold have been reported from other parts of Texas. Some\r\nof these localities are in Eocene Tertiary sandstones in the Gulf\r\nCoastal Plain, in Cretaceous limestones in Irion, Uvalde, and Williamson\r\ncounties, and in sand and gravel in Howard and Taylor counties. None of\r\nthese deposits has been found to have any commercial value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Granite\r\n\r\n\r\nGranite is an intrusive igneous rock that is made up chiefly of\r\ncrystalline grains or crystals of quartz and a feldspar mineral, such as\r\northoclase or microcline. Several other minerals, including mica and\r\nhornblende, may also be present.\r\n\r\nAll of the mineral grains in granite are about the same size, and you\r\ncan distinguish them without using a magnifying glass. A granite may be\r\ncoarse grained, medium grained, or fine grained. When you examine this\r\nrock, you will see that its grains are not cemented but interlocked like\r\nthe pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. The color of granite, which is pink, red,\r\ngray, or brownish, depends chiefly on the color of its feldspar grains.\r\n\r\nMost granites formed from hot, molten magma that slowly cooled and\r\nhardened far below the earth’s surface. Because of this slow cooling,\r\nfairly large mineral grains were formed.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Polished section of pink granite from Gillespie County,\r\n                                Texas.]\r\n\r\nGranites are now seen at the surface in several areas of Texas. They\r\nwere gradually uncovered as the areas became higher and the overlying\r\nrocks slowly weathered away. One of these areas is the Llano uplift of\r\ncentral Texas where the granites occur in Blanco, Burnet, Gillespie,\r\nLlano, and Mason counties. These granites formed during Precambrian time\r\nand are believed to be about a billion years old. (Scientists are now\r\nable to determine the age of some rocks accurately by very precisely\r\nmeasuring the relative amounts of isotopes produced by decay of\r\nradioactive minerals.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Texas State Capitol building at Austin is made of Burnet\r\nCounty granite obtained from Granite Mountain near Marble Falls, Texas.]\r\n\r\nGranites also appear at the surface in the Trans-Pecos country of west\r\nTexas. Some of these areas include the Franklin Mountains of El Paso\r\nCounty, the Quitman Mountains of Hudspeth County, the Chisos Mountains\r\nof Brewster County, and the Chinati Mountains of Presidio County.\r\n\r\nRed, pink, and gray granites from quarries in the Llano uplift area are\r\nwidely used as building stones and monument stones. A large quarry at\r\nGranite Mountain just west of Marble Falls in Burnet County has supplied\r\npink granite for buildings in many parts of the United States. The Texas\r\nCapitol building and several other State buildings in Austin are made of\r\nthis granite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Graphite\r\n\r\n\r\nGraphite is a mineral that is made up of a single element—carbon.\r\n(_Diamond_, although it does not look at all like graphite, is a\r\ncrystalline form of carbon.) Graphite is a steel-gray or black mineral\r\nthat commonly has a metallic luster. It is not heavy and is extremely\r\nsoft. Graphite will soil your fingers and leave a black mark on paper.\r\nThis mineral cleaves perfectly in one direction and splits into thin\r\nflakes that feel greasy.\r\n\r\nTo help distinguish graphite from _molybdenite_, a mineral it resembles,\r\nyou can use a shiny, glazed surface, such as is found on a saucer or a\r\nplate, to test its streak. When rubbed across this kind of surface,\r\ngraphite will leave a black streak, but molybdenite will leave a\r\ngreenish one.\r\n\r\nGraphite commonly occurs as scales, as sheet-like layers, or as compact\r\nmasses. It may be found mixed with clay or other impurities, and it then\r\nlooks dull and earthy. Crystals of graphite, which are seldom found, are\r\n6-sided and flat.\r\n\r\nGraphite occurs in Llano, Burnet, and other counties in the Llano uplift\r\narea of central Texas. One of the Nation’s most important graphite mines\r\nis located in the Clear Creek area several miles northwest of Burnet in\r\nBurnet County. Some graphite has also been mined near Lone Grove in\r\nLlano County. In addition, a graphite schist, obtained south of Llano in\r\nLlano County, has been used as a filtering material.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Graphite is used in pencil lead, generator brushes, and\r\n                              lubricants.]\r\n\r\nAll of this graphite occurs in extremely old Precambrian graphite schist\r\nrocks that we now see at the surface in this part of Texas. It is\r\nbelieved that the schists were once ancient sedimentary rocks, such as\r\nshales, which contained organic matter. Long ago, great forces below the\r\nearth’s surface altered these rocks. When this happened, the organic\r\nmaterial that they contained changed into the mineral we know as\r\ngraphite.\r\n\r\nGraphite has a number of uses. It is mixed with clay to make the pencil\r\nlead that we use for writing. It serves as a lubricant, either alone or\r\nmixed with oil, grease, or water. In addition, graphite is used to make\r\ngenerator brushes, stove and shoe polish, and special paints. Because it\r\ncan stand great heat without melting, some graphite is mixed with clay\r\nto make the pots or crucibles that hold molten metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrossularite. _See_ Garnet.\r\n\r\n\r\nGypsite. _See_ Gypsum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Gypsum\r\n\r\n\r\nGypsum is a hydrous calcium sulfate. This mineral is normally colorless\r\nor white, but impurities cause it to appear gray, brownish, yellowish,\r\nor reddish. It is transparent or translucent and is not heavy. When you\r\nrub gypsum across a streak plate, it leaves a white streak. This mineral\r\nis so soft that a fingernail scratches it easily. Gypsum occurs in\r\nseveral varieties.\r\n\r\nThe colorless, glassy, and transparent variety of gypsum is called\r\n_selenite_. It is found as cleavable masses and as crystals that are\r\nprism-shaped or flat and diamond-shaped. It is not uncommon for two\r\ncrystals to be joined together so that they have a swallow-tail\r\nshape—these crystals are _twinned_. Groups of flat selenite crystals\r\narranged together so that they resemble flowers are called _rosettes_.\r\nMany of these have been found in Nolan County.\r\n\r\nGypsum has four directions of cleavage. One of these directions is so\r\nperfect that some selenite splits into thin, clear sheets that may be\r\nmistaken for mica; other selenite cleavage fragments may be mistaken for\r\ncalcite. You can distinguish selenite sheets from calcite by testing\r\ntheir hardness (selenite is softer) and by putting a drop or two of\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid on them. The acid will fizz and bubble on\r\ncalcite but not on the selenite gypsum. There is also a quick way to\r\ndistinguish the thin selenite cleavage fragments from mica. After you\r\ncarefully bend a thin sheet of mica, it will snap back to its original\r\nshape without breaking. Selenite gypsum, however, is not elastic. It\r\nwill bend, but it will break if you try to straighten it again.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Selenite gypsum crystal from Bastrop County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nSelenite is found in cracks and cavities in rocks. Good crystals have\r\nbeen collected at Gyp Hill, a salt dome southeast of Falfurrias in\r\nBrooks County, and some selenite has been mined there. Selenite crystals\r\nalso occur scattered through clays, particularly along creek banks, in\r\nLee, Fayette, Bastrop, and several other counties.\r\n\r\nAnother variety of gypsum is known as _fibrous gypsum_. It is made up of\r\nslender, brittle, needle-like fibers that fill the cracks in some rocks.\r\nIf fibrous gypsum has a silky or pearly luster, it is called _satin\r\nspar_. One of the places where satin spar occurs is in Permian rocks in\r\nHardeman County.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Selenite gypsum rosettes from Nolan County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nMost of the fibrous gypsum and selenite is formed by solutions. Some of\r\nthese solutions develop when underground waters, seeping through rocks,\r\npick up and dissolve minerals that contain sulfur (such as pyrite). This\r\ndissolved material changes the water into very weak sulfuric acid. When\r\nthe sulfuric acid meets calcium carbonate (as in limestone or calcite),\r\nit combines with the calcium to form the gypsum.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fibrous gypsum from Terlingua area, Brewster County,\r\n                                Texas.]\r\n\r\nA massive, fine-grained, and translucent variety of gypsum, known as\r\n_alabaster_, is used for articles such as lamp bases, statuettes, vases,\r\nand book-ends.\r\n\r\nA loose, earthy, crumbly variety of gypsum, called _gypsite_, is\r\nordinarily found mixed with other materials, such as clay, sand, and\r\nsoil. It occurs either at or near the surface of the ground. Gypsite is\r\nfound in Culberson, Reeves, and other counties in west Texas.\r\n\r\nA massive, granular variety of gypsum, called _rock gypsum_, may occur\r\nin large deposits. This is the gypsum that is used for making products\r\nsuch as plaster, wallboard, and some cements.\r\n\r\nDeposits of rock gypsum are found both underground and at the surface in\r\nTexas. Surface deposits occur in Permian rocks in several counties to\r\nthe east of the Texas High Plains. They also occur in the area between\r\nthe Pecos River and the Delaware and Apache Mountains in Culberson and\r\nReeves counties. Some of the other surface deposits are found near the\r\nMalone Mountains in Hudspeth County and in Lower Cretaceous rocks in\r\nGillespie and Menard counties. Rock gypsum has been mined from the\r\ndeposits in Fisher, Gillespie, Hardeman, Hudspeth, and Nolan counties.\r\nIt also has been produced from the cap-rock at Hockley salt dome in\r\nHarris County.\r\n\r\nGypsum and another mineral, anhydrite, have very nearly the same\r\ncomposition. Both are calcium sulfates. Gypsum, however, contains water\r\nof crystallization, and anhydrite does not. It is likely that most of\r\nthe rock-gypsum deposits of Texas originally were beds of anhydrite. By\r\nabsorbing water that seeped through it, the anhydrite changed into\r\ngypsum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Halite\r\n\r\n\r\nHalite, sodium chloride, is the table salt you sprinkle on food for\r\nseasoning. This mineral ordinarily is white or colorless, but other\r\nmaterials cause it to be tinted red, blue, gray, brown, or green. When\r\nyou rub halite across a streak plate, it leaves a white streak.\r\n\r\nBecause halite cleaves in three directions, all at right angles to each\r\nother, the cleavage fragments are shaped like cubes. You can see some of\r\nthem by looking at a few grains of table salt through a magnifying\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nHalite has a salty taste and dissolves easily in water. It also is\r\ntransparent to translucent and has a glassy luster. This mineral is soft\r\nenough for a copper penny to scratch it. Halite commonly occurs as cubic\r\ncrystals and as granular or compact masses.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its use as table salt, much halite goes to make soda ash,\r\nchlorine, and other chemicals. A few of its other uses are in leather\r\nmaking, meat packing, and food canning.\r\n\r\nTexas has large underground deposits of halite. These deposits, known as\r\n_rock salt_, occur in the Permian subsurface basin of west Texas and in\r\nthe salt domes of the Gulf Coastal Plain. The Permian basin, which\r\nextends under parts of west Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, and\r\nKansas, is now completely filled with sediments. It appears level and\r\nflat when you travel across it and does not look at all like a basin or\r\na valley. During Permian time, however, this area was covered by a salty\r\nsea. As the sea gradually dried up, the dissolved material that it\r\ncontained was deposited as thick beds of halite, anhydrite, and other\r\nminerals. Later, these minerals were covered by sedimentary rocks which\r\nwere deposited on top of them. Now, the minerals are found many hundreds\r\nof feet below the surface. In Hutchinson, Mitchell, Ward, and Yoakum\r\ncounties, some of this Permian basin salt has been produced (as brine)\r\nfrom wells that have been drilled into it.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Salt domes, which are huge, underground columns of\r\n               halite, occur on the Gulf Coastal Plain.]\r\n\r\nThe Gulf Coastal Plain salt domes are huge and almost circular columns\r\nof halite, some of which are more than 2 miles wide. Some are less than\r\n300 feet below the surface, but most of them are much deeper. These salt\r\ncolumns pushed upward many thousands of feet from great, deeply buried\r\nsalt deposits. The halite is mined from shafts dug into the Hockley salt\r\ndome in Harris County and into the Grand Saline salt dome in Van Zandt\r\nCounty. Salt brines are produced from wells drilled into several salt\r\ndomes of this area.\r\n\r\nAt the surface in Texas, halite occurs in salt lakes in Crane and\r\nHudspeth counties and in alkali lakes on the High Plains. It is found\r\nalso on the shores of bays and lagoons in Cameron, Kenedy, Kleberg, and\r\nWillacy counties, and it occurs at springs and seepages in various\r\nplaces in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Hematite\r\n\r\n\r\nHematite, iron oxide, the chief ore of iron, is found in many places in\r\nTexas but not in large deposits. This mineral may have a metallic luster\r\nand appear reddish brown, dark brown, steel gray, or black or it may\r\noccur as a soft, red, earth-like material called _red ocher_.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Specular hematite from Carrizo Mountains, Hudspeth\r\n                            County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nMost metallic hematite is too hard for a pocket knife to scratch, but\r\nquartz or a steel file will scratch it. Hematite is fairly heavy, for it\r\nhas a specific gravity of 5.26. This mineral has no cleavage, but some\r\nspecimens show three directions of parting that are almost at right\r\nangles to each other. A great help in identifying hematite is the dark\r\nreddish-brown streak it leaves when you rub it across a streak plate.\r\n\r\nSome hematite occurs as rounded masses that resemble kidneys or bunches\r\nof grapes (then called _kidney ore_); it also is found as flat crystals.\r\nMost of the Texas hematite occurs as granular or compact masses. One of\r\nthese massive varieties is composed of shiny scales or plates and is\r\ncalled _micaceous_ or _specular hematite_. This variety has been found\r\nin Hudspeth County and in northeastern Mason County. Hematite also\r\ncommonly occurs as cementing material in many Texas sandstones.\r\n\r\nSome hematite is formed by the alteration of magnetite, another iron\r\nmineral. This hematite is known as _martite_, and some of it still has\r\nthe crystal shape (an octahedron or a dodecahedron) that belonged to the\r\nmagnetite. Most of the hematite found in the Llano uplift area of\r\ncentral Texas is believed to be altered magnetite. In this central Texas\r\narea, some massive, granular martite has been mined at the Gamble\r\nprospect, a few miles southeast of Fredonia in northeastern Mason\r\nCounty, where it occurs as layers in Precambrian gneiss.\r\n\r\nSmall deposits of hematite occur in other parts of Texas, too. Some of\r\nthe west Texas localities include Sierra Blanca, the Quitman Mountains,\r\nand the Carrizo Mountains of Hudspeth County and the area around Shafter\r\nin Presidio County.\r\n\r\n\r\nHollandite. _See_ Manganese Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\nHyalite. _See_ Opal.\r\n\r\n\r\nJasper. _See_ Quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\nKaolin. _See_ Clay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Limestone\r\n\r\n\r\nLimestone is a sedimentary rock made up chiefly of calcite, a\r\ncalcium-carbonate mineral. This rock also commonly contains grains of\r\nquartz, clay minerals, the mineral dolomite, or other materials. If a\r\nlarge amount of dolomite is present, the rock is called _dolomitic\r\nlimestone_. In some limestones, the mineral grains are too small to be\r\ndistinguished from each other without a magnifying glass or a\r\nmicroscope, but in other limestones, the individual mineral grains are\r\neasily seen.\r\n\r\nPure limestone is white, but if it contains clay or plant or animal\r\nmatter it is light gray, dark gray, or black. Limestone also may be some\r\nshade of yellow, brown, or red. It is fairly soft and can be scratched\r\nwith a knife. Because this rock contains calcite, an easy chemical test\r\nwill help identify it: a drop or two of dilute hydrochloric acid will\r\nquickly fizz and bubble when placed on the limestone.\r\n\r\nLimestones form in fresh water, such as in lakes, but most of them form\r\nin the seas. As some earlier-formed rocks are weathered, the calcium\r\nminerals that they contain are dissolved. Creeks and rivers carry this\r\ndissolved material to the sea. There, small animals, such as corals,\r\ncrinoids, sponges, and foraminifers, take the dissolved material out of\r\nthe water to build their calcium carbonate shells. Plants, such as\r\nalgae, can take calcium carbonate out of solution too, and it collects\r\non them. Shells, shell fragments, and plant remains accumulate on the\r\nsea floor, forming limy deposits that later become limestone.\r\n\r\nLimestones also originate in a slightly different way. When the\r\ntemperature and chemical composition of the water permit, calcium\r\ncarbonate precipitates as millions of tiny grains of calcite and forms a\r\nlimy mud that is converted to limestone. Many limestones contain shell\r\nor plant fragments in addition to these tiny grains of calcite.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Polished section of Lower Cretaceous Edwards Limestone\r\n       from Travis County, Texas, containing fossil gastropods.]\r\n\r\nThere are several special kinds of limestone. If the rock is made up of\r\nmany little rounded calcite grains that resemble fish eggs, it is called\r\n_öolitic limestone_. Another limestone, _chalk_, is soft, white, and\r\nfine grained. It consists mostly of tiny shell fragments and\r\nfine-grained calcite. _Coquina_ is a porous limestone made up of loosely\r\ncemented shells and shell fragments. Another special kind of limestone,\r\nknown as _lithographic limestone_, because it can be used in printing,\r\nis smooth, firm, and hard. Its mineral grains are too small to be\r\nrecognized without a microscope. This kind of limestone breaks with a\r\nsmooth, sometimes curved, fracture. Still another variety, _pulverulent\r\nlimestone_, is loose, soft, powdery, and white. It occurs in the Lower\r\nCretaceous Edwards Limestone in Williamson and Bell counties of central\r\nTexas. Some of this limestone is used to polish rice grains, and it is\r\nadded to livestock feeds to provide calcium for the animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Limestone quarry in Lower Cretaceous Edwards Limestone at\r\n                 Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nMuch limestone is found at the surface in Texas in Cambrian, Ordovician,\r\nMississippian, Pennsylvanian, Permian, and Cretaceous formations. If you\r\nwill look at numbers 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 on the Texas geologic map (pp.\r\n4-5), you will see that these strata appear at the surface in central,\r\nnorth-central, and Trans-Pecos Texas.\r\n\r\nLimestone has many important uses. Much Texas limestone is crushed and\r\nused as a road-building material and as an aggregate that is mixed with\r\ncement to make concrete. Farmers in some areas improve their crops by\r\nadding limestone to the soil. Limestone also is sent to the iron\r\nfurnaces in east Texas to be used in the production of pig iron and\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nSome of the Texas limestones are heated to a fairly high temperature in\r\norder to change them into _lime_ (calcium oxide). Industry uses a large\r\namount of lime in making chemicals, steel, glass, paper, and other\r\nproducts. Builders use it to make plasters, mortars, and stuccos. At\r\nplants in Comal, Johnson, Travis, and Williamson counties, lime is made\r\nfrom Cretaceous limestones.\r\n\r\nAnother important use of limestone is in making _portland cement_. The\r\nlimestone is mixed with clay or shale, and the mixture is burned in a\r\nkiln until it just begins to melt. Then it is allowed to cool. Next, it\r\nis finely ground and in order to keep the finished cement from hardening\r\nor setting too quickly when it is used, a _retarder_, such as gypsum, is\r\nadded. A number of cement-manufacturing plants in Texas use Cretaceous\r\nlimestones, shales, and clays.\r\n\r\nMany of the Texas limestones make excellent building stones. Some of\r\nthem are quarried from Pennsylvanian and Cretaceous formations in\r\nnorth-central Texas and from Lower Cretaceous formations in counties\r\nnear the Llano uplift of central Texas. A large quarry on the\r\nWilliamson-Travis County line near Cedar Park in central Texas has\r\nsupplied Cretaceous limestone for many buildings and monuments in the\r\nUnited States and Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Limonite\r\n\r\n\r\nLimonite is not really a definite mineral but is a mixture of iron\r\noxides containing water. It is believed to be closely related to an iron\r\nmineral called _goethite_. Some limonite may be dull and earthy with the\r\nappearance of brownish-yellow or rusty brown clay. This variety is so\r\nsoft that a fingernail will scratch it easily.\r\n\r\nOther limonite has a dark brown or black color and a metallic or almost\r\nmetallic luster. A copper penny will not scratch it, but a steel file\r\nwill. This kind of limonite may have a shiny black surface that\r\nresembles glossy lacquer. The property that will help you most in\r\nidentifying limonite is the rusty, yellowish-brown streak it leaves when\r\nrubbed across a streak plate.\r\n\r\nLimonite has no cleavage and no crystal shape of its own. But crystals\r\nof other iron minerals, such as pyrite and magnetite, alter to form\r\nlimonite. It then occurs with a crystal shape that originally belonged\r\nto one of these other minerals. (Such false forms of minerals are called\r\n_pseudomorphs_.) Limonite also occurs as layers in rocks, as hollow or\r\nsolid concretions, or as coatings on other minerals. It is found mixed\r\nwith minerals such as clays and serves as the cementing material in some\r\nsandstones.\r\n\r\nLimonite is found in many localities in Texas including Blanco,\r\nBrewster, Burnet, Llano, and San Saba counties. The most important\r\nlimonite deposits in Texas, however, are in the eastern part of the\r\nState, particularly in Anderson, Cass, Cherokee, Henderson, Marion,\r\nMorris, Nacogdoches, Smith, and Upshur counties.\r\n\r\nThe east Texas limonite deposits occur mainly in Weches sedimentary\r\nrocks. These rocks, which were deposited in the sea during Eocene\r\nTertiary time, contain clay along with greensands. (Greensands are\r\nsmall, soft grains that contain _glauconite_, a mineral composed of\r\niron, silicon, and several other elements.) Later, as the sea retreated,\r\nthese sediments became a part of the land. Waters seeping through the\r\nsediments changed into weak solutions of carbonic and sulfuric acid that\r\ndissolved the iron out of some of the greensands. When conditions were\r\nfavorable, this iron was re-deposited as an iron-carbonate mineral\r\ncalled _siderite_. Siderite was changed to limonite by weathering. Some\r\nsiderite is still found in east Texas, and it is also mined along with\r\nthe limonite as an iron ore.\r\n\r\nEast Texas iron ore has been mined from time to time ever since about\r\n1855, and records show that a number of local iron furnaces once\r\noperated. The brown iron ore (as the limonite is also called) now is\r\nmined from open pits in Cass, Cherokee, and Morris counties.\r\n\r\nThis ore, after being washed, goes into blast furnaces at Lone Star\r\n(near Daingerfield) and at Houston. In the blast furnaces the ore is\r\nchanged into metallic iron by mixing it with coke (made from coal) and\r\nlimestone and blowing in blasts of hot air.\r\n\r\nTo make steel, the iron from the blast furnace (called _pig iron_) is\r\nput into open-hearth furnaces together with scrap iron, limestone, and\r\nother materials. This mixture is heated and melted together to get rid\r\nof unwanted substances. Then other elements, such as molybdenum,\r\nmanganese, or nickel, are added to make steel with the right strength\r\nand toughness.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Limonite ore is changed to metallic iron in a blast\r\n                               furnace.]\r\n\r\n  Skip car\r\n  Hot Gases\r\n  Blast Furnace\r\n  Iron Ore\r\n  Limestone\r\n  Coke\r\n  Fire Brick lining\r\n  Steel Plate covering\r\n  3550°F\r\n  Hot Air Blast\r\n  Slag\r\n  Slag Ladle\r\n  Molten Iron\r\n  Iron Ladle\r\n\r\nSteel mills alongside the furnaces in Texas turn out many products, such\r\nas steel plates for oil tanks, ships, and tank cars and steel beams for\r\nframework in buildings and bridges. Some of their other products include\r\npipes for the oil and chemical industries and wire for nails and fencing\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n\r\nLithographic Limestone. _See_ Limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Llanite\r\n\r\n\r\nLlanite is a unique rock that is found only in Llano County in central\r\nTexas. This intrusive igneous rock is made up of easily seen crystals\r\nand grains of quartz and feldspar that are scattered through a\r\nbrown-colored mass of extremely small mineral grains. The quartz is\r\nbeautiful, sky-blue, and opal-like; the feldspar has a rusty pink color.\r\n(Because the quartz looks like opal, this rock often is called _opaline\r\ngranite_.) The mineral grains that make up the brown-colored mass are so\r\ntiny that they can be identified only with a microscope. They are\r\nquartz, feldspar, mica, fluorite, and apatite.\r\n\r\nLlanite formed during Precambrian time. Molten rock material forced its\r\nway upward into cracks that cut across granite and schist rocks while\r\nthe rocks were still far underground. This hot magma remained in the\r\ncracks where it cooled and hardened to form long, narrow, wall-like\r\nmasses (called _dikes_) of llanite. We can see some of the llanite dikes\r\nexposed at the earth’s surface to the north and northeast of Llano in\r\nLlano County because the overlying rocks have weathered away.\r\n\r\nLlanite has been quarried from one of the dikes west of Babyhead in\r\nnorthern Llano County. Because llanite is both attractive and strong, it\r\nhas been used as an ornamental stone and as a monument stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Magnetite\r\n\r\n\r\nMagnetite, iron oxide, is a black, metallic mineral with an outstanding\r\nphysical property: it is magnetic—fragments of magnetite readily cling\r\nto a magnet. It also leaves a black streak when rubbed across a streak\r\nplate. Although this mineral is too hard to be scratched by the average\r\npocket knife, a steel file will scratch it. Magnetite is fairly heavy—it\r\nhas a specific gravity of 5.18.\r\n\r\nMagnetite occurs as compact or granular masses, as scattered grains, and\r\nas crystals. Most of the crystals are octahedrons, but some\r\ndodecahedrons are found. Magnetite helps make up a part of many\r\nmetamorphic and igneous rocks, and it also occurs as tiny crystals and\r\ngrains in some sands, sandstones, and other sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Metallic iron, after leaving the blast furnace, is made\r\n                 into steel in an open-hearth furnace.]\r\n\r\n  Open-Hearth Furnace\r\n  Scrap metal\r\n  Alloying Elements\r\n  Limestone\r\n  Furnace Interior\r\n  Live Fuel Burner\r\n  Air pre-heated\r\n\r\nMost of the magnetite that has been found in Texas occurs in Precambrian\r\ngneiss and schist rocks of the Llano uplift area of central Texas,\r\nparticularly in Llano County and in eastern Mason County. It occurs as\r\nthin layers, as thick lens-shaped deposits, and as scattered grains in\r\nthe rocks. Probably at least a billion years ago these gneisses and\r\nschists were sedimentary rocks, such as shales and sandstones. Some\r\ngeologists believe that these rocks could have contained iron sediments\r\n(perhaps in the form of _glauconite_). Great forces below the earth’s\r\nsurface crumpled and squeezed the sedimentary rocks and changed them\r\ninto the metamorphic schist and gneiss rocks we see today. As this\r\nhappened, the iron sediments in the rocks were changed into magnetite.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Granular magnetite fragments from northwest of Llano,\r\n            Llano County, Texas, are attracted to a magnet.]\r\n\r\nAt least some of the magnetite in this area (such as the deposit at Iron\r\nMountain in Llano County) probably had a different sort of origin.\r\nMolten igneous rock material containing iron could have moved up into\r\ncracks in the ancient sedimentary rocks. Then the magnetite formed from\r\nthis iron material when the igneous and sedimentary rocks were changed\r\ninto the schists and gneisses of today.\r\n\r\nNone of the Llano and Mason County magnetite deposits is really very\r\nlarge. Nevertheless, prospecting and a little mining have been carried\r\non from time to time at several deposits in this area. At Iron Mountain,\r\nwhich is about 12 miles northwest of Llano in Llano County, magnetite\r\nhas been mined from open pits. Although magnetite is commonly used as a\r\nsource of iron, the magnetite from this deposit was used as a heavy\r\nconcrete aggregate.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalachite. _See_ Copper Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         Manganese Minerals (Braunite, Hollandite, Pyrolusite)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough manganese does not occur alone in nature as a native element,\r\nit makes up a part of many minerals and compounds. This element has an\r\nimportant use in steel making, where it helps rid the steel of unwanted\r\nsubstances, such as oxygen and sulfur, and, in addition, it is used to\r\nmake tough, hard, manganese steel for armor plate, railroad tracks,\r\nsafes, and steam shovels. Manganese has various uses outside the steel\r\nindustry. It is added to copper and nickel to make alloys, it is used in\r\nthe manufacture of dry-cell batteries, and (as manganese sulfate) it is\r\nused as a fertilizer.\r\n\r\nManganese minerals and compounds, such as _braunite_, _hollandite_,\r\n_pyrolusite_, and _wad_, occur in several counties in Texas. No large,\r\ncommercial deposits have been found here.\r\n\r\nSome manganese compounds and minerals are covered with a soft, sooty\r\nblack material that will soil your fingers. This can help you recognize\r\nthese minerals; however, a few non-manganese minerals, such as some\r\nchalcocite, also have a black coating that soils your fingers in a\r\nsimilar way.\r\n\r\nOne of the manganese minerals, _braunite_, is a complex oxide of\r\nmanganese that contains silica. It has a submetallic luster and is dark\r\nsteel-gray or black. When rubbed across a streak plate, it leaves a\r\nsteel-gray or a black streak. This mineral is too hard to be scratched\r\nby a pocket knife, but a piece of quartz or a steel file will scratch\r\nit. Braunite has a specific gravity of 4.75 to 4.82. It has four\r\ndirections of cleavage that are parallel to the faces of a pyramid.\r\n\r\nIn the Spiller mine, about 15 miles northeast of Mason in Mason County,\r\nmasses of braunite occur as lens-shaped layers in Precambrian gneiss and\r\nquartzite rocks. This braunite may have formed from another manganese\r\nmineral (possibly manganese garnet) that was exposed at the earth’s\r\nsurface after the overlying rocks eroded away. As this other mineral\r\nweathered, it may have altered into braunite, or the braunite could have\r\nbeen deposited from solutions emanating from hot magmas before the great\r\nthickness of overlying rock was removed.\r\n\r\nThe mineral variety _hollandite_ is a rare manganate of manganese and\r\nbarium. It has a metallic luster, and its color is silvery gray or\r\nblack. When you rub it across a streak plate, hollandite leaves a black\r\nstreak. It has a specific gravity of 4.7 to 5. Hollandite is rather\r\nhard, but a steel file will scratch it.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: Hollandite from Jeff Davis County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nHollandite occurs in western Jeff Davis County in west Texas at what is\r\ncalled the Mayfield prospect. Here, it is found as rounded masses that\r\noccur in a vein near a large fault in Lower Cretaceous limestone rocks.\r\n\r\nOther manganese compounds, _pyrolusite_ and _wad_, are found in several\r\nimportant deposits near the Pecos River in western Val Verde County.\r\n_Pyrolusite_ is a manganese dioxide mineral. It is black, opaque, and so\r\nsoft that it rubs off on your fingers like soot. Pyrolusite may be\r\ngranular and massive or may be powdery. It also occurs as a fern-like\r\ncoating on rocks. _Wad_ is not really a mineral but is an impure,\r\ndull-black or brownish-black mixture of manganese oxide, water, and\r\nother substances. It can be soft enough to soil your fingers, or it can\r\nbe too hard to scratch with a pocket knife. Wad occurs in earthy or\r\ncompact masses or in crusts or stains on rocks.\r\n\r\nIn Val Verde County, the wad and pyrolusite are found mixed with soil,\r\nclay, gravel, sand, and plant remains. This material fills cracks in\r\nLower Cretaceous limestones, it is scattered through gravels, and it is\r\ndeposited in low places at the surface. The manganese in these deposits\r\ncame from limestone rocks that have since weathered away. Rainwater\r\ntrickled into these rocks and dissolved the manganese minerals they\r\ncontained. This manganese was washed down toward the Pecos River and was\r\ndeposited as wad and pyrolusite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Marble\r\n\r\n\r\nMarble is a metamorphic rock made up chiefly of sparkling grains of\r\ncalcite or dolomite, but other minerals may be present. The marble may\r\nbe fine grained, medium grained, or coarse grained; commonly, all the\r\nmineral grains are about the same size.\r\n\r\nMarble may be of uniform color, banded, spotted, or streaked. If it is\r\nmade up only of pure calcite or dolomite, the marble is white. If,\r\nhowever, it contains carbonaceous material, such as graphite, it is\r\ngrayish or black. Limonite impurities cause the marble to be yellowish\r\nbrown, and manganese oxides and hematite give it a brownish, pinkish, or\r\nreddish color.\r\n\r\nMarble is a rather soft rock, and you can scratch it easily with a\r\npocket knife. A few drops of dilute hydrochloric acid will bubble and\r\nfizz readily on calcite marble; on dolomite marble, it may fizz\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\nMarble forms from limestone or from dolomite rock. Heat and pressure\r\nbelow the earth’s surface cause the calcite and dolomite mineral grains\r\nin these rocks to recrystallize. A fine-grained limestone can be changed\r\ninto a coarse-grained calcite marble. The marble is not made up of new\r\nand different minerals, but it has a new texture unlike that of the\r\nlimestone. (To a builder, the word _marble_ has another meaning. He\r\nconsiders rocks such as unaltered limestone, unaltered dolomite, or even\r\nserpentine to be marble, if they will take a high polish.)\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Polished section of Precambrian metamorphic marble from\r\n                         Llano County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nMetamorphic marbles occur at the surface in central Texas and in west\r\nTexas. Some of the west Texas occurrences are in the Van Horn area of\r\nCulberson and Hudspeth counties and in the Big Bend area of Brewster\r\nCounty. In central Texas, Precambrian marbles are found in Burnet,\r\nGillespie, Llano, and Mason counties of the Llano uplift area. Many of\r\nthem are suitable for use as monument and building stones. Some of the\r\nLlano County marble is quarried and used as granules for roofs and as\r\nterrazzo chips for making colorful floors (described with serpentine on\r\np. 88).\r\n\r\n\r\nMartite. _See_ Hematite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Mica\r\n\r\n\r\nMica is not just one mineral but is the name given to a group of similar\r\nminerals. The mica minerals are easy to recognize. Because they have\r\nperfect cleavage in one direction, they split into thin, flat sheets.\r\nYou can see through some mica sheets, and they are elastic enough to be\r\nbent back and forth. (Another mineral, selenite gypsum, also will split\r\ninto thin, flat, transparent sheets, but selenite sheets break when you\r\nbend them.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Mica minerals have perfect cleavage in one direction,\r\n           resulting in thin, sheet-like cleavage fragments.]\r\n\r\n  Basal Cleavage\r\n\r\nTwo of the mica minerals that you are most likely to find in Texas are\r\n_muscovite_ and _biotite_. Both these minerals are potassium-aluminum\r\nsilicates, and biotite, in addition, contains magnesium and iron. In\r\ngeneral, muscovite is light colored, that is, it has a light brown,\r\nyellow, or green tint, or is colorless, and biotite is dark colored,\r\ncommonly dark green, brown, or black. These minerals have glassy or\r\npearly lusters and are rather soft—a copper penny scratches them. The\r\nspecific gravity of biotite is 2.8 to 3.2, and that of muscovite is 2.76\r\nto 3.1.\r\n\r\nMica minerals occur in igneous rocks, such as granite and pegmatite, and\r\nin metamorphic rocks, such as schist and gneiss. They also are found as\r\ntiny flakes in some sandstones, limestones, and other sedimentary rocks.\r\nMost of the Texas mica is found in the Llano uplift area (particularly\r\nin Llano County) and in the Mica Mine area. (The Mica Mine area is in\r\nthe Van Horn Mountains about 15 miles south of Van Horn in west Texas.)\r\nIn both these areas, the mica minerals occur mostly in Precambrian\r\npegmatites and mica schists.\r\n\r\nThe gleaming mica schists were once igneous rocks or sedimentary rocks\r\nsuch as sandstones and shales. Long ago, great forces beneath the\r\nearth’s surface changed the rocks into mica schists. The mica that is\r\nfound in pegmatites formed from hot fluids of igneous origin when the\r\npegmatite rock itself was formed.\r\n\r\nClusters of mica in the pegmatites are called _books_, because the thin\r\nsheets into which the mica splits look like pages. Some muscovite books\r\nup to 8 inches across are found in the Mica Mine area of the Van Horn\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nThe books or sheets of muscovite mica that occur in pegmatites are\r\nespecially valuable to industry. Muscovite can stand great heat without\r\nmelting, it is tough, it splits into thin sheets, and it lets very\r\nlittle heat and electricity pass through. Because of these properties,\r\nmuscovite is used in fuses and as insulators in heating elements of\r\nelectric irons and toasters. (Biotite is not used, because the iron it\r\ncontains makes it a conductor of electricity.) Sheet muscovite also is\r\nwidely used by the electronics industry as a non-conducting material in\r\nthe manufacture of tubes and other products.\r\n\r\nBoth muscovite and biotite from mica schist rocks, as well as scrap\r\npieces of sheet mica from pegmatites, are ground into flakes or powder.\r\nThis ground-up mica has many uses, ranging from a powder coating for\r\nautomobile inner-tubes to Christmas tree “snow.”\r\n\r\nOnly a small amount of mica has been mined in Texas. A fair grade of\r\nsheet mica occurs in the pegmatites at Mica Mine in west Texas, but the\r\ndeposit is not large. In the pegmatites of the Llano uplift area of\r\ncentral Texas, no sheet mica has been found that is considered good\r\nenough for the requirements of industry. Mica suitable for grinding,\r\nhowever, is found in both these Texas areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicaceous Hematite. _See_ Hematite.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrocline. _See_ Feldspar.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilky Quartz. _See_ Quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuscovite. _See_ Mica.\r\n\r\n\r\nNative Silver. _See_ Silver Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Obsidian and Vitrophyre\r\n\r\n\r\nObsidian is a dark, glassy-looking igneous rock. Most obsidian contains\r\nthe same chemical elements as granite and rhyolite, since all three of\r\nthese rocks can form from the same type of molten rock material.\r\nObsidian, however, has no separate minerals, because its chemical\r\nelements are not combined in an orderly way. It is a natural glass.\r\n\r\nBecause it is a glass, we know that obsidian forms very quickly. One way\r\nfor it to form is from the sudden cooling of hot, molten lava that flows\r\nout of volcanoes. If the lava cools and hardens before the separate\r\nminerals can crystallize, it becomes a natural glass, such as obsidian.\r\n\r\nThis rock is smooth and shiny. Most of it is black, but some can be dark\r\ngreen or dark brown. Obsidian allows light to pass through it, and it\r\nbreaks with a curved, conchoidal fracture. The broken edges are very\r\nsharp.\r\n\r\nAnother glassy igneous rock that forms from fast-cooling lava is\r\n_vitrophyre_. It looks like obsidian except that it has crystals or\r\ncrystalline mineral grains (which may be light colored) scattered\r\nthrough the dark glassy material.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Obsidian was used by the Indians to make arrowheads.]\r\n\r\nObsidian and vitrophyre are found in the Big Bend area of Brewster and\r\nPresidio counties in west Texas. They occur with other igneous rocks\r\nthat formed there during Tertiary time.\r\n\r\nThe Indians who long ago roamed this area used the smooth, shiny\r\nvitrophyre and obsidian to make some of their arrowheads and scrapers.\r\nToday, rock collectors pick up these attractive rocks for their\r\ncollections, and some of them cut and polish obsidian and vitrophyre for\r\nuse as gemstones.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnyx. _See_ Quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\nÖolitic Limestone. _See_ Limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Opal\r\n\r\n\r\nOpal is like hardened jelly or gelatin. It has no crystalline inner\r\nstructure and no crystal shape of its own—it is amorphous. This mineral\r\nhas almost the same chemical composition as quartz. Both are silicon\r\ndioxides (silica), but opal, in addition, contains water.\r\n\r\nOpal can be almost any color—red, yellow, blue, brown, gray, white—or it\r\ncan be colorless. It is transparent or translucent and appears glassy,\r\nresinous, greasy, or dull. Opal has a specific gravity of 1.9 to\r\n2.2—this mineral is a little lighter than quartz. It also is softer than\r\nquartz. A copper penny will not scratch opal, but quartz will. Opal has\r\na white streak and a curved, conchoidal fracture but no cleavage.\r\n\r\nOpal occurs in a number of places in Texas. In the Trans-Pecos country\r\nof west Texas, it fills cracks and cavities in some of the extrusive\r\nigneous rocks. It occurs on the High Plains of northwest Texas, and it\r\nis found in Tertiary formations of the Gulf Coastal Plain where it\r\noccurs as masses that fill cracks and cavities in sedimentary rocks, as\r\nthe cementing material in some sandstones (such as in the Catahoula\r\nsandstone), and as opalized wood.\r\n\r\nMuch opal forms from underground waters that contain silicon. These\r\nsolutions move through the rocks and deposit the opal in them.\r\n\r\nOpal is found in a number of varieties. Some show a beautiful, lustrous\r\nplay of colors that comes from inside the specimens. These varieties are\r\nknown as _precious opal_ and are prized as gemstones. In Texas, some\r\nprecious opal is found near Alpine in Brewster County. It has a milky\r\nwhite to bluish-white color, is translucent, and shows a fiery orange,\r\nred, blue, and green play of colors.\r\n\r\nThe variety known as _common opal_ shows no play of colors. It may be\r\nwhite, gray, bluish, reddish, greenish, or yellowish, and it is only\r\nslightly translucent. It is found in Brewster, Jeff Davis, Presidio, and\r\nother counties of the Trans-Pecos country of west Texas. It occurs also\r\naround some of the wet-weather (playa) lakes on the Texas High Plains.\r\nIn the Gulf Coastal Plain, common opal is found with chalcedony (a\r\nvariety of quartz) in Tertiary formations. A south Texas locality\r\nsometimes visited by collectors is near Freer in Duval County.\r\n\r\nA clear, commonly rounded, variety of opal that looks like ice is called\r\n_hyalite_. Two areas in which it has been found are in Presidio County\r\nin west Texas and in Llano County in central Texas.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: Opalized wood from Washington County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nA variety of petrified wood, called _opalized wood_, is opal that\r\nreplaced the fibers of a piece of wood. Wood opal is found at a number\r\nof places in the Gulf Coastal Plain. It occurs there in Tertiary\r\nformations within about 20 miles of the boundary line between areas 2\r\nand 3 shown on the geologic map (pp. 4-5).\r\n\r\nA soft opaline material called _diatomite_, or _diatomaceous earth_, is\r\nmade up chiefly of the skeletons of diatoms—tiny, one-celled plants that\r\nlive in fresh or salt water. These little plants are able to take silica\r\nfrom the water to make opal skeletons for themselves. When the diatom\r\nskeletons collect at the bottom of a lake or sea, they form the light,\r\ncrumbly, white, gray, or cream-colored deposit of impure opal known as\r\ndiatomite. Industry uses this material as a filter, as insulation, as an\r\nabrasive, and as a filler.\r\n\r\nDiatomite formed in ancient lakes on the Texas High Plains during late\r\nTertiary (Pliocene) and early Quaternary (Pleistocene) times. It is\r\nfound in Armstrong, Crosby, Dickens, Ector, Hartley, and Lamb counties.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpaline Granite. _See_ Llanite.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrthoclase. _See_ Feldspar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Pegmatite\r\n\r\n\r\nPegmatites occur in igneous rock areas, and most geologists consider\r\nthem intrusive igneous rocks. They are made up of crystals and\r\ncrystalline mineral grains that fit together—the grains are interlocked.\r\nThe crystals and grains in pegmatites are larger than those of\r\nsurrounding rocks, and some are huge, even larger than a man. However,\r\nthere is a wide range of grain sizes in pegmatite.\r\n\r\nSome pegmatites cut through igneous or metamorphic rocks in such a way\r\nthat they resemble walls (called _dikes_). Others are found as veins, as\r\nflat masses, or as odd-shaped bodies in rocks. Many pegmatites occur in\r\ngranites and contain feldspar, quartz, mica, and other minerals, as\r\ngranite does. Some pegmatites occur with other kinds of igneous rocks\r\nand contain the same minerals as these rocks. A few pegmatites contain\r\nrare and unusual minerals.\r\n\r\nMany geologists believe that pegmatites form from hot fluids of igneous\r\norigin that are left after other igneous rocks, such as granite, have\r\nalready formed. These left-over fluids contain large amounts of\r\naluminum, potassium, silicon, sodium, and several other elements. While\r\nthe granite or other rocks are still far underground, this material\r\npushes up into them, and may even partly dissolve them. Then it slowly\r\ncools and hardens into pegmatite. It is believed that, later, more\r\nfluids move into cracks in some pegmatites. This new material adds other\r\nminerals to the pegmatites and alters some of those minerals already\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Quartz-feldspar pegmatite from Burnet County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nSome of the pegmatites we now see at the surface in Texas are probably\r\nabout a billion years old. They formed during Precambrian time and occur\r\nwith other extremely old rocks. One well-known Texas pegmatite area is\r\nthe Mica Mine district of west Texas. It is about 15 miles south of Van\r\nHorn in the Van Horn Mountains of Culberson and Hudspeth counties.\r\nAnother pegmatite area is in the Llano uplift of central Texas. These\r\ncentral Texas pegmatites occur in Burnet, Gillespie, Llano, and Mason\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nLarge crystals and grains of feldspar, mica, and quartz are found in the\r\npegmatites of both these areas. A small amount of mica has been mined\r\nfrom the west Texas pegmatites, and feldspar has been produced from the\r\ncentral Texas pegmatites.\r\n\r\nAn extremely rare and unusual pegmatite occurs in the Llano uplift area\r\nat Baringer Hill, which is west of Burnet in Llano County. This\r\npegmatite was once on the bank of the Colorado River, but when Buchanan\r\nDam was built, the area was flooded. The Baringer Hill pegmatite now\r\nlies beneath the water of Lake Buchanan. Many rare minerals, which\r\ncontain beryllium, cerium, thorium, uranium, yttrium, zirconium, and a\r\nnumber of other elements, occur in this pegmatite. Some of these\r\nminerals, such as those containing yttrium and zirconium, glow or\r\nincandesce when they are heated. During the early part of this century,\r\nbefore the area was flooded, several of the yttrium minerals were mined\r\nand used in making lamp mantles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPitchblende. _See_ Uranium Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrecious Opal. _See_ Opal.\r\n\r\n\r\nPulverulent Limestone. _See_ Limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\nPumicite. _See_ Volcanic Ash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Pyrite\r\n\r\n\r\nPyrite is a shiny, pale golden-yellow or brassy-yellow metallic mineral.\r\nThis mineral, an iron disulfide, is so often mistaken for gold that it\r\nis widely known by the nickname _fool’s gold_.\r\n\r\nExcept for their similar color and luster, pyrite and gold are really\r\nvery different. When you rub pyrite across a streak plate, it leaves a\r\nblack, a greenish-black, or a brownish-black streak, but the streak of\r\ngold is gold-colored. Pyrite is too hard for the average pocket knife to\r\nscratch, but a knife will scratch gold easily. Pyrite is brittle and\r\nreadily breaks, but gold is malleable and flattens out when hit with a\r\nhammer. Pyrite is only about 5 times as heavy as an equal volume of\r\nwater, but pure gold is over 19 times as heavy. And pyrite may have a\r\nbrown or a multicolored tarnish on it, but gold never tarnishes.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Pyrite veins in white marble from Llano County, Texas.]\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: Cubic crystals of pyrite.]\r\n\r\nPyrite is a common mineral and is found in many of the igneous,\r\nmetamorphic, and sedimentary rocks of Texas. It may be scattered through\r\nthe rocks, or it may fill cracks and cavities in them. This mineral\r\noccurs as granular and compact masses, as rounded masses, or as\r\ncrystals. The crystals are commonly cubes, pyritohedrons, or\r\noctahedrons. In some crystals, the shapes are combined (such as a cube\r\nwith an octahedron or two pyritohedrons grown through each other). You\r\nmay notice that the sides of some cubes and pyritohedrons have fine,\r\nparallel grooves (called _striae_ or _striations_) on them.\r\n\r\nPyrite originates in a number of different ways. Some of it forms, along\r\nwith other minerals in igneous rocks, from hot magmas. It also forms in\r\nmetamorphic rocks by the same processes that produce these rocks. Some\r\nof the pyrite in limestone and other sedimentary rocks is formed when\r\nthe rocks themselves are deposited by seas or streams. Pyrite also is\r\ndeposited by the hot fluids that are given off by magmas. These fluids\r\ntravel up into cracks and other openings in rocks and then form pyrite\r\nas well as other minerals. Much pyrite forms in still another way. As\r\nwater seeps through rocks, it dissolves some of the iron minerals that\r\nthey contain. When, under certain conditions, these iron solutions mix\r\nwith hydrogen sulfide (this is the gas that makes some water smell like\r\nrotten eggs), pyrite is formed.\r\n\r\nPyrite alters easily. Because of this, most builders carefully check the\r\nlimestone, granite, marble, or whatever other building stone they plan\r\nto use to be sure that it does not contain large amounts of pyrite. When\r\nexposed to the weather, pyrite changes to limonite and causes an\r\nunsightly rust stain.\r\n\r\nPyrite is used as a source of sulfur, and it is produced for this\r\npurpose in several states. In Texas, however, no pyrite deposits have\r\nbeen found that are large enough to be mined.\r\n\r\n\r\nPyrolusite. _See_ Manganese Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Quartz\r\n\r\n\r\nQuartz, silicon dioxide, is one of the most common minerals. It is\r\nglassy, waxy, greasy, or dull and is transparent or translucent. Pure\r\nquartz is colorless, but impurities make some varieties white, black, or\r\na shade of red, yellow, blue, violet, or brown. Quartz is a hard\r\nmineral. It scratches window glass and cannot be scratched by a pocket\r\nknife or even by a steel file. It has a specific gravity of 2.65. The\r\ncurved, conchoidal fracture shown by many specimens helps identify it.\r\n\r\nQuartz is plentiful in Texas. It occurs in igneous rocks, such as\r\ngranite, llanite, and pegmatite; in metamorphic rocks, such as\r\nquartzite, schist, and gneiss; and in sedimentary rocks, such as some\r\nsandstone, conglomerate, and breccia.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Quartz crystal, with inclusions, from Burnet County,\r\n                                Texas.]\r\n\r\nQuartz is found as crystals and as masses. Some of the masses are\r\ncoarsely crystalline, but some are made up of extremely small\r\ncrystalline particles called _cryptocrystalline_ quartz. Some of the\r\ncryptocrystalline varieties of quartz found in Texas are chalcedony,\r\nchert, and jasper. Some of the coarsely crystalline varieties found here\r\nare amethyst, milky quartz, rose quartz, smoky quartz, and rock crystal.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Amethyst geode from the Alpine area of Brewster County,\r\n                                Texas.]\r\n\r\nA colorless, glassy variety of quartz, called _rock crystal_, is clear\r\nenough to see through. It is found as crystals that are 6-sided prisms\r\nwith pyramid-like faces on the ends. This variety is commonly associated\r\nwith igneous rocks, such as those of the Llano uplift area of central\r\nTexas and of the Trans-Pecos country of west Texas. It is commonly used\r\nas a gemstone and is made into necklaces, earrings, and other jewelry.\r\nSome specimens of rock crystal have slender, needle-like crystals of\r\nother minerals, such as tourmaline, actinolite, or rutile, enclosed in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA clear, glassy variety of quartz, _amethyst_, has a purple or violet\r\ncolor. It, like rock crystal, is commonly found in 6-sided prisms with\r\npyramid-shaped ends and is also prized as a gemstone. Amethyst has been\r\nfound in Precambrian rocks in the Llano uplift area of central Texas.\r\n(Amethyst Hill, a locality well known to collectors for many years, is\r\nin northeastern Gillespie County.) In west Texas, amethyst has been\r\nfound in Cenozoic igneous rocks in the Sierra Blanca and Quitman\r\nMountains of Hudspeth County and in the Alpine area of Brewster County.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: Milky quartz from Burnet County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nA variety of quartz with a milk-white color and a glassy to greasy\r\nluster is called _milky quartz_. It occurs either as crystals or as\r\ncrystalline masses. Very little light will pass through it. In central\r\nTexas, milky quartz occurs abundantly in the Precambrian rocks of the\r\nLlano uplift area in Blanco, Burnet, Gillespie, Llano, and Mason\r\ncounties. It also is found in some of the rocks of the Trans-Pecos\r\ncountry of west Texas, such as in the Carrizo Mountains of Culberson and\r\nHudspeth counties. Other good places to look for this variety of quartz\r\nare in the sands and gravels along many streams in Texas.\r\n\r\nSome quartz has a glassy to a greasy luster and a rose or pink color.\r\n_Rose quartz_, as this variety is called, commonly occurs as masses\r\nrather than as individual crystals. It can be found along some of the\r\nstreams in Texas and also in igneous rocks, such as those of the Llano\r\nuplift area of central Texas.\r\n\r\nA kind of quartz with a smoky brown, a smoky yellow, or a dark\r\nbrownish-black color is called _smoky quartz_. Its luster is glassy, and\r\nit may be either translucent or transparent. Smoky quartz is commonly\r\nfound as crystals that are shaped like 6-sided prisms with pyramid-like\r\nends. It is commonly associated with igneous rocks, and beautiful\r\nspecimens have been found in the Lake Buchanan area of Llano and Burnet\r\ncounties in central Texas.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Smoky-quartz crystals from Burnet County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nA cryptocrystalline variety of quartz, _chalcedony_, has a waxy to dull\r\nluster and a tan, white, gray, or light-blue color. It is translucent\r\nbut not transparent. Chalcedony does not have its own crystal shape but\r\ninstead is found in masses that line or fill cracks, pores, and other\r\ncavities in rocks. It is formed when water containing silicon slowly\r\nseeps into these openings in the rocks and deposits the silicon dioxide\r\nthere as chalcedony.\r\n\r\nChalcedony commonly occurs in some of the Tertiary rocks of the Gulf\r\nCoastal Plain. For example, chalcedony associated with opal is found\r\nnear Freer in northern Duval County. In the High Plains of west Texas,\r\nit is found in alkali-lake deposits, such as at Shafter Lake in Andrews\r\nCounty and at Cedar Lake in Gaines County. In the Trans-Pecos country of\r\nwest Texas, it can be found filling small cavities in extrusive igneous\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Polished agate from Rio Grande gravels of Zapata County,\r\n                                Texas.]\r\n\r\nA variety of chalcedony that generally is made up of more than one color\r\nis called _agate_ (although agates consisting of several shades of a\r\nsingle color are also found). The colors may be spread out unevenly so\r\nthat the agate has a cloudy appearance, or they can be arranged in wavy,\r\nin straight, or in concentric lines or bands. If the bands are straight\r\nand parallel, the specimen is called _onyx_. Agate that has a moss-like\r\nor tree-like design in it is called _moss agate_. Some agates make\r\nattractive gemstones when cut and polished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jasper from Uvalde County, Texas. Dark areas are brownish\r\n                 red; light areas are a yellowish-tan.]\r\n\r\nMuch agate has been found filling cavities in Cenozoic igneous rocks in\r\nBrewster, Presidio, and other counties in the Trans-Pecos country of\r\nwest Texas. It has been found also in an area about 10 to 15 miles wide\r\nalong the Rio Grande, mostly in southern Webb County and in Zapata and\r\nStarr counties.\r\n\r\nTrees and other plants have been replaced by agate. Many specimens of\r\n_agatized wood_ have been collected from Tertiary formations in Fayette,\r\nGonzales, Lee, Washington, and other counties of the Gulf Coastal Plain.\r\n(The agatized wood, along with opalized wood, occurs within about 20\r\nmiles of the boundary between no. 2 and no. 3 on the geologic map, pp.\r\n4-5.)\r\n\r\nA hard, compact, slightly translucent variety of cryptocrystalline\r\nquartz is called _jasper_. It commonly has a red, brown, or yellow color\r\ndue to the presence of an iron oxide, such as hematite. Some jasper is\r\nmade up of irregular bands of more than one of these colors. This\r\nvariety of quartz often is polished to make attractive gem or ornamental\r\nstones. It has been collected at several localities in Texas,\r\nparticularly from creek and river gravels. Starr and other nearby\r\ncounties along the Rio Grande have furnished a number of good specimens.\r\n\r\nA hard, smooth, compact, translucent rock that is made up mostly of\r\ncryptocrystalline quartz is called _chert_ or _flint_. It is white,\r\nblack, or some shade of gray, brown, or pink, and its luster is waxy,\r\nslightly glassy, or dull. Chert is found in many creek and river gravels\r\nin Texas. It also occurs with limestone, such as in the Lower Cretaceous\r\nEdwards Limestone of central Texas and in the Ordovician Ellenburger\r\nstrata in the Llano uplift area. Chert also is found with the Ordovician\r\nrocks of the Marathon area of Brewster County.\r\n\r\nGeologists do not agree on whether chert and flint are two names for one\r\nvariety of rock, or whether each is a separate variety. Some, however,\r\nnow give _chert_ a geological meaning and _flint_ an archaeological\r\nmeaning. They use the word _chert_ to describe geological formations or\r\nrock specimens. They give the name _flint_ to the same rock when it has\r\nbeen used by Indians in making arrowheads, scribers, scrapers, and\r\nspearheads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Quartzite\r\n\r\n\r\nQuartzite is either a metamorphic rock or a sedimentary rock. (The\r\nsedimentary kind of quartzite is described with sand and sandstone on p.\r\n86.) Metamorphic quartzite is made up mostly of quartz. It forms when\r\nheat and fluids below the earth’s surface cause the grains and cement of\r\na quartz sandstone to recrystallize. When this happens, the grains\r\ninterlock and are no longer held together by cement. Metamorphic\r\nquartzite, like sedimentary quartzite, is a hard, firm rock that breaks\r\nthrough the quartz grains instead of between them.\r\n\r\nAncient Precambrian metamorphic quartzite occurs at the surface in the\r\nLlano uplift area of central Texas, in the Van Horn area of west Texas,\r\nand in the Franklin Mountains north of El Paso in extreme west Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Rhyolite\r\n\r\n\r\nRhyolite is a fine-grained or glassy igneous rock that commonly is\r\nextrusive or volcanic. It has a pink, red, tan, white, gray, purple, or\r\nblack color. This rock, like granite, is made up chiefly of feldspar and\r\na silica mineral, such as quartz, but other minerals may be present.\r\nBoth rhyolite and granite form from the same kind of molten rock\r\nmaterial. Nevertheless, even though their compositions are the same,\r\nthese two rocks do not look alike. Their textures differ because granite\r\nforms slowly and rhyolite forms quickly.\r\n\r\nMuch of the Texas rhyolite formed from hot, molten lava. This lava\r\nflowed out onto the surface either through volcanic cones or cracks in\r\nthe ground. Some of the lava cooled and hardened too quickly for mineral\r\ngrains to develop. This rapidly cooled lava formed a rhyolite rock that\r\nis made up, at least partly, of glass. In many of the rhyolites,\r\ncrystalline mineral grains were able to form, but these grains are\r\nextremely small, and you may not be able to distinguish them even with a\r\nmagnifying glass. Some rhyolite, because it hardened from moving,\r\nflowing lava, has streaks and bands of different colors and textures.\r\nThis rhyolite has _flow structure_.\r\n\r\nOne variety of rhyolite has easily seen crystals and grains of minerals,\r\nsuch as feldspar, quartz, and mica, scattered through a mass of the tiny\r\ncrystalline grains (in much the same way that raisins are scattered\r\nthrough a cake). The easily seen crystals and grains are called\r\n_phenocrysts_, and the rock itself is called a _rhyolite porphyry_.\r\n\r\nMany rhyolites and rhyolite porphyries occur in the Tertiary igneous\r\nrocks of the Trans-Pecos country of west Texas. Just a few of these\r\nlocalities include the Barrilla Mountains of Jeff Davis and Reeves\r\ncounties, the Chisos Mountains of Brewster County, the Chinati Mountains\r\nof Presidio County, and the Davis Mountains of Jeff Davis County.\r\n\r\n\r\nRock Crystal. _See_ Quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\nRock Gypsum. _See_ Gypsum.\r\n\r\n\r\nRock Salt. _See_ Halite.\r\n\r\n\r\nRose Quartz. _See_ Quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\nSalt. _See_ Halite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Sand and Sandstone\r\n\r\n\r\nSand is a loose, uncemented sedimentary deposit made up of fragments of\r\nweathered rocks and minerals. These fragments must be of a certain size\r\n(between ¹/₁₆ millimeter and 2 millimeters in diameter) in order to be\r\ncalled sand grains. The largest sand grains are about the size of a\r\npinhead. Sand grains are smaller than the fragments known as _granules_;\r\nthey are larger than those known as _silt_.\r\n\r\nMany sands are made up chiefly of grains of quartz. This mineral is\r\nplentiful and does not easily weather away. In addition, rock fragments\r\nand many other minerals, such as feldspar, mica, gypsum, magnetite, and\r\ngarnet, are found as sand grains.\r\n\r\nRains wash many of the sand grains and other weathered rock and mineral\r\nfragments into creeks and rivers. These streams may carry the sand and\r\nother sediments long distances before depositing them. Today, we find\r\nsands along the banks of many creeks and rivers in Texas and along the\r\nbeaches of the Gulf of Mexico. The sand in the rivers is in transit to\r\nthe Gulf. In addition, sand occurs at the surface in other Cenozoic\r\nformations and in some of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic formations of\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nSand has many uses. Much _building sand_, which is used in mortar and\r\nconcrete, is produced from numerous sand and gravel pits in Texas. Pure\r\nquartz sand that can be used to make glass is known as _glass sand_.\r\nSome of it is found in north-central Texas in Lower Cretaceous\r\nformations. A large glass sand quarry is located at Santa Anna in\r\nColeman County. Along the Gulf Coastal Plain, sand that is used in\r\nglassmaking occurs in Eocene Tertiary strata.\r\n\r\nA coarse-grained sand, _blast sand_, is used with compressed air to\r\nclean the walls of brick and stone buildings and to carve designs on\r\nmonument stones, such as marbles. Some coarse sand is also used as a\r\n_filtering_ sand in purifying water. These types of sand have been\r\nproduced from the Gulf Coastal Plain as well as from other areas of\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nSand grains, when nature cements them together, make up the sedimentary\r\nrock _sandstone_. Some sandstones form when underground water carrying\r\ndissolved mineral matter moves through loose sand. As the dissolved\r\nmineral matter comes out of solution, it forms a cement that binds the\r\nsand grains together.\r\n\r\nThe cement may be material such as calcite (calcium carbonate), quartz,\r\nchalcedony, or opal, which are silica minerals, and limonite and\r\nhematite, which are iron oxides. Clay also may serve as a cement. It is\r\neither deposited along with the sand or is formed from weathered\r\nfeldspar sand grains.\r\n\r\nThe color of the cementing material helps determine the color of the\r\nrock. Iron oxide cement, for example, causes the sandstone to have a\r\nreddish, yellowish, or brownish color. Sandstones also are white, black,\r\ngray, green, or cream colored.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, sandstones break through the cementing material, not through\r\nthe sand grains. Thus, the broken surface of the rock feels rough and\r\ngritty. Some quartz sand grains, however, are tightly cemented with\r\nsilica to form an extremely hard and compact rock. If this rock breaks\r\nsmoothly through the grains instead of between them, it is known as\r\n_quartzite_. Some of this sedimentary quartzite occurs in the Texas Gulf\r\nCoastal Plain in the Tertiary Catahoula strata. (Another kind of\r\nquartzite is described on pp. 84-85.)\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Sandstone from the Eocene Wilcox Group of strata of\r\n                  northwestern Zavala County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nOrdinary sandstones are seen at the surface in many localities in Texas,\r\nand a number of them have been used as building stones. Some of the\r\nplaces where sandstones occur are in the Cambrian and Pennsylvanian\r\nformations of the Llano uplift area of central Texas and in the\r\nPennsylvanian, Permian, and Lower Cretaceous formations of north-central\r\nTexas. Tertiary sandstones occur in the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain, and\r\nTriassic sandstones are found along the edges of the Texas High Plains.\r\nSandstone is also found in many formations of the Trans-Pecos country of\r\nwest Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nSandstone. _See_ Sand and Sandstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSatin Spar. _See_ Gypsum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Schist\r\n\r\n\r\nSchist is a metamorphic rock that splits easily along thin, generally\r\nparallel layers, called _folia_. These layers may be either straight or\r\ncurved, and they are made up of crystalline grains of one or more than\r\none mineral. This structure is called _schistosity_ or _foliation_. When\r\nyou examine schist, you will see that many of the mineral grains are\r\nflat or long, and that they are lined up in one direction to form the\r\nlayers. Some schists have fairly large crystals (many with perfect\r\nshapes) scattered through them. For example, mica schists may contain\r\nbeautiful crystals of garnet.\r\n\r\nEach kind of schist is named for an outstanding mineral that it\r\ncontains. Mica schist contains a large amount of mica. We also find\r\nhornblende schist, actinolite schist, chlorite schist, talc schist, and\r\ngraphite schist. (Graphite schist is discussed with graphite on p. 63.)\r\n\r\nSchists form from other rocks, such as granite, gabbro, or shale. The\r\nrocks are changed into schists by fluids and by heat and pressure below\r\nthe earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nExtremely ancient schists that formed during Precambrian time are\r\nexposed at the surface in the Allamoore—Van Horn area of west Texas and\r\nin the Llano uplift area of central Texas. Geologists believe that the\r\nPacksaddle Schist of the Llano uplift area was once shale. Good\r\nexposures of this schist are seen in the Honey Creek area near\r\nPacksaddle Mountain in Llano County.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchorl. _See_ Tourmaline.\r\n\r\n\r\nSedimentary Quartzite. _See_ Sand and Sandstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelenite. _See_ Gypsum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Serpentine\r\n\r\n\r\nSerpentine is the name given both to a rock and to a mineral. The\r\nmineral serpentine (a hydrous magnesium silicate) is found in two\r\ndifferent forms. If it is fibrous, it is called _chrysotile_; if it is\r\nlayered and platy, it is known as _antigorite_. Antigorite is brownish\r\ngreen and smooth and waxy looking. Some of it can be split into thin\r\nsheets. Chrysotile is made up of greenish, silky fibers, which may be\r\nbrittle and break apart in large pieces. If, however, the fibers can be\r\npulled apart into soft flexible, little threads, the mineral is called\r\n_chrysotile asbestos_.\r\n\r\nLight will pass through both these varieties of serpentine, and both are\r\nsoft enough to be scratched by a pocket knife. When rubbed across a\r\nstreak plate, they leave white streaks. Antigorite and chrysotile have\r\nno crystal shapes of their own, but several other minerals can alter to\r\nform these two varieties of serpentine. Thus antigorite and chrysotile\r\nmay be found as _pseudomorphs_ in a crystal shape that originally\r\nbelonged to another mineral.\r\n\r\nAntigorite and chrysotile are commonly found closely mixed with\r\ndolomite, talc, magnetite, calcite, pyrite, and several other minerals.\r\nThese minerals make up serpentine rock (also called _serpentinite_).\r\nThis rock ordinarily is some shade of green (such as whitish, yellowish,\r\nbrownish, bluish, or dark blackish green), and it may be mottled. It is\r\nbrittle or tough and generally is massive. Serpentine rock, like the\r\nserpentine minerals, is fairly soft—you can scratch it with a pocket\r\nknife.\r\n\r\nIn the Llano uplift area of central Texas, serpentine rock is found\r\namong Precambrian metamorphic rocks, such as gneiss and schist. An\r\nespecially large deposit in this area is known as the Coal Creek\r\nserpentine mass. It is over 3½ miles long, and at one place, it is\r\nalmost 1½ miles wide. This mass of serpentine extends across the\r\nBlanco-Gillespie County line in the extreme northern parts of these two\r\ncounties. (A little fibrous chrysotile is found here, but it will not\r\nbreak into flexible enough threads to be called chrysotile asbestos.)\r\nSeveral other deposits of serpentine occur in northeastern Gillespie\r\nCounty and in southern Llano County.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the Coal Creek serpentine was formed from an igneous\r\nrock such as _peridotite_, which is made up chiefly of grains of the\r\nmineral _olivine_. The peridotite may have been altered into serpentine\r\nby underground waters that seeped through it. It is possible, however,\r\nthat other serpentines in the area were formed when rocks were altered\r\nby hot fluids and great pressures far below the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nThe Llano area serpentine has been widely used in terrazzo floors. To\r\nmake these floors, small pieces of serpentine and other colored rocks\r\nare put into cement that is spread over a concrete slab. Then, after the\r\ncement has hardened, it is ground to a flat, smooth surface and\r\npolished. The resulting terrazzo floor is both colorful and durable.\r\n\r\nSerpentine rock also is cut into slabs, polished, and used as indoor\r\nbuilding stones. _Verde antique_, a variety often seen in the lobbies of\r\noffice buildings, consists of green serpentine rock with streaks of\r\nwhite calcite or dolomite in it.\r\n\r\nIn the Balcones fault zone area (shown on the Texas physiographic\r\noutline map, p. 42) from Uvalde County to Williamson County, serpentine\r\noccurs with Upper Cretaceous rocks. The serpentine rock is seen at the\r\nsurface in a few places (such as in Travis and Uvalde counties), but\r\nmuch of it is underground. In several oil fields of this area (as at\r\nThrall field in Williamson County and at Lytton Springs field in\r\nCaldwell County), the serpentine rocks contain oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nSerpentinite. _See_ Serpentine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Shale\r\n\r\n\r\nShale is a sedimentary rock made up of tightly packed clay and mud\r\nparticles. It has a smooth appearance because it is so fine grained. In\r\nfact, most of the particles in it are too small to be distinguished with\r\na magnifying glass. These particles are the weathered remains of earlier\r\nrocks. They were carried by creeks and rivers to other parts of the land\r\nor to the sea, where they formed layers of clay and mud. Later, other\r\nsediments were deposited on top of them. The weight of these new\r\nsediments squeezed the clays and muds together to form firm, compact\r\nshale.\r\n\r\nShale looks very much like some clays. It, like clay, can be almost any\r\ncolor. If the shale contains animal or plant matter, it is black, gray,\r\nor blue. If it contains iron oxide (many minerals containing iron alter\r\nto this material), it is a shade of red, yellow, or brown. Shale is soft\r\nand can be easily scratched by a knife. It also is brittle and crumbles\r\neasily. This rock has a property that will help you to distinguish it\r\nfrom clay: the particles that make up the shale were deposited in\r\nlayers, and the shale splits into flat, thin flakes along these layers,\r\nwhich clay will not do.\r\n\r\nShale is fairly abundant in Texas, especially in Mississippian,\r\nPennsylvanian, and Cretaceous formations. For example, Pennsylvanian\r\nshales are found at the surface in north-central Texas, in the area\r\naround the Llano uplift of central Texas, and in the Marathon and\r\nSolitario uplifts of west Texas.\r\n\r\nMany of shale’s uses are the same as those of clay. Some of it can be\r\nused to make brick, tile, and other products, and some is often used\r\ninstead of clay in making portland cement. Cement plants at Dallas, El\r\nPaso, Fort Worth, and Waco are located at places where Cretaceous\r\nlimestones, which also are used in cement making, and Cretaceous shales\r\nare found near each other at the surface.\r\n\r\nOil shale, from which petroleum can be obtained by heating, has been\r\nfound in central Texas. It occurs in Mississippian formations in\r\nLampasas, McCulloch, and San Saba counties. Because oil is much less\r\nexpensive to obtain from wells, it is not produced from these shales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        Silver Minerals (Argentite, Cerargyrite, Native Silver)\r\n\r\n\r\nSilver has many uses. Like gold, it is a beautiful metal that long has\r\nbeen used for coins and ornaments. A large amount of silver goes to make\r\narticles such as spoons, forks, platters, and trays. The photographic\r\nindustry uses silver—much of the film for cameras is coated with a\r\nsilver halide. Doctors and dentists use silver, too. The mixture that a\r\ndentist uses to fill teeth contains silver along with several other\r\nmetals. Doctors sometimes use silver wire to fasten broken bones, and\r\nsilver compounds and solutions, such as silver nitrate, are used in some\r\nkinds of medical treatment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps more people have heard of legendary, lost silver mines of Texas\r\nthan of the actual and important silver deposits found in the\r\nTrans-Pecos country of west Texas. Some of the west Texas silver\r\nminerals include _argentite_, _cerargyrite_, and _native silver_.\r\nAlthough the argentite and native silver commonly found there are mixed\r\nwith galena, a lead mineral, or with chalcocite, a copper mineral, they\r\nalso occur separately.\r\n\r\nThe element silver is found alone as _native silver_. When pure, it is\r\nrather easy to recognize. It is metallic and has a silver-white color\r\nthat may tarnish to gray, black, or yellowish brown. Native silver is\r\nheavy (it has a specific gravity of 10.5) and soft (a pocket knife\r\nscratches it easily). When you rub it across a streak plate, native\r\nsilver, unless it is tarnished, leaves a shiny, silver-white streak.\r\nThis metal is so ductile that it can be drawn into a wire. It is also\r\nmalleable and flattens when hit with a hammer.\r\n\r\nSilver occurs as crystals, which are poorly shaped cubes and\r\noctahedrons, or as irregular masses. It may have a net-like appearance\r\n(called _reticulate_), or it may be shaped like little needles\r\n(described then as _acicular_). It occurs in wires (then called\r\n_filiform_) or as scales or plates.\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: Prospector.]\r\n\r\nTwo of the Texas silver minerals, _argentite_ and _cerargyrite_, do not\r\nresemble silver at all. _Argentite_, a silver sulfide, is also called\r\n_silver glance_. It is a dark, lead-gray mineral with a metallic luster\r\nthat weathers to a dull black. When you rub it across a streak plate,\r\nargentite gives a shiny, blackish to lead-gray streak. This mineral is\r\nsoft enough to leave a mark on paper. It has a specific gravity of 7.3,\r\nand it is sectile enough to be cut smoothly (like soap) with a knife. In\r\nsome places argentite is found as irregular masses or as a coating on\r\nrocks and other minerals.\r\n\r\nAnother silver mineral, _cerargyrite_ (or _horn silver_) is a silver\r\nchloride. This mineral has a nonmetallic luster and is transparent to\r\ntranslucent. It resembles pearl-gray, white, greenish, or colorless wax.\r\nWhen exposed to the light it turns violet brown or black. Cerargyrite is\r\nsoft—you can scratch it with a fingernail. Like argentite, it is\r\nsectile. This mineral has a specific gravity of 5.5, and it commonly\r\noccurs as irregular masses and as crusts.\r\n\r\nThese silver minerals have been mined at a number of places in\r\nTrans-Pecos Texas. The largest silver mine in Texas, the Presidio mine,\r\nis located near Shafter in south-central Presidio County. It contains\r\nargentite, cerargyrite, and native silver, along with galena and several\r\nother minerals. This mine is not open now, but in the years between 1885\r\nand 1942, it produced a large amount of silver along with some lead and\r\ngold. There are several other lead-silver mines in this Shafter area,\r\nbut none has produced as much as the Presidio mine.\r\n\r\nIn this mine, the silver minerals occur mostly in large, flat deposits\r\nin Permian limestone and other sedimentary rocks. The minerals are\r\nbelieved to have been deposited there—probably during Tertiary time—by\r\nsolutions that came from hot magma far below the rocks. As they moved in\r\nalong the layers of limestone, the solutions replaced portions of this\r\nrock with minerals containing silver, lead, and other elements. Later,\r\nwater seeped into these deposits and dissolved some of the minerals.\r\nThis dissolved material was then re-deposited, and it formed most of the\r\nminerals we now find there.\r\n\r\nNo silver is being mined in Texas at present, but it has, in the past,\r\nbeen produced from other Trans-Pecos mines. Galena that contains silver\r\n(called _argentiferous galena_) has been mined at the Bird mine at\r\nAltuda Mountain (about 14 miles east of Alpine) in northern Brewster\r\nCounty. It also has been obtained from mines in the Quitman Mountains\r\nand in the Eagle Mountains of Hudspeth County. Some cerargyrite has been\r\nmined at the Plata Verde mine near the Culberson-Hudspeth County line.\r\n\r\nSeveral mines in the Van Horn area of Culberson and Hudspeth counties\r\nhave produced silver along with copper. An important silver mine in this\r\narea is the now idle and flooded Hazel mine. (This mine is described\r\nwith copper minerals on p. 52.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSmoky Quartz. _See_ Quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoapstone. _See_ Talc and Soapstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecular Hematite. _See_ Hematite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Sulfur\r\n\r\n\r\nSulfur is one of Texas’ most valuable minerals. It consists of only a\r\nsingle element, sulfur. This mineral has a resinous luster and is\r\ntransparent to translucent. Sulfur ordinarily is yellow, but impurities\r\ncause it to look greenish, brownish, reddish, or grayish. When you rub\r\nit across a streak plate, it leaves a white or a pale-yellow streak.\r\nSulfur has a specific gravity of 2.04 to 2.09 and is soft enough to be\r\nscratched by a copper penny. It breaks with a conchoidal to uneven\r\nfracture. When it gets hot enough (478° Fahrenheit), sulfur will burn.\r\nFor this reason, it often is called _brimstone_.\r\n\r\nSulfur does not conduct electricity and is a poor conductor of heat. You\r\ncan test how poorly heat passes through it by holding a fragment of\r\nsulfur up to your ear. You may be able to hear a crackling sound. The\r\nsound results when the outer part of the fragment expands (due to the\r\nheat from your hand) while the inner part (which has received no heat)\r\nremains unchanged.\r\n\r\nCrystals of sulfur are sometimes found, and most of them have either a\r\ndouble-pyramid shape or a flat, tabular shape. Sulfur also occurs as\r\ncompact masses, as crusts, and as scattered grains.\r\n\r\nNative sulfur deposits are found in two widely separated areas of\r\nTexas—one in west Texas and the other along the Gulf Coast in southeast\r\nTexas, extending over into Louisiana. In the Gulf Coast area, native\r\nsulfur is found on some of the salt domes.\r\n\r\nThe salt domes are huge (from about half a mile to more than 2 miles\r\nacross), column-shaped masses made up of halite and some anhydrite.\r\nThese masses have pushed up toward the surface through thousands of feet\r\nof sand, clay, and other sedimentary rocks. On top of many of the salt\r\ncolumns is a covering of limestone (calcite), anhydrite, and gypsum\r\nknown as the _cap-rock_. It is in this cap-rock that the sulfur is\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that when the masses of halite and anhydrite pushed toward\r\nthe earth’s surface, some of the upper part of the halite dissolved. The\r\nanhydrite, however, did not dissolve, and it remained on top of the salt\r\ncolumn. Then, a part of this anhydrite was altered into the gypsum,\r\nlimestone, and sulfur that now are found in some of the cap-rocks.\r\nLaboratory experiments have shown that the sulfur in the cap-rocks\r\nlikely formed through the action of sulfate-reducing bacteria. These\r\nbacteria, in the presence of petroleum, converted the sulfate in some of\r\nthe anhydrite into hydrogen sulfide. Later, hydrogen sulfide was\r\noxidized—perhaps by reaction with more of the anhydrite—to form the\r\nsulfur.\r\n\r\nMost of the large cap-rock sulfur deposits are about 1,500 to 2,400 feet\r\nunderground. At first, an attempt was made to get this sulfur out of the\r\nground by digging shafts down to it, but loose, wet, caving sands and\r\npoisonous gases, such as hydrogen sulfide, made this mining method\r\nalmost impossible. Finally, a chemist, Herman Frasch, found a way to\r\nobtain the sulfur by making use of sulfur’s low melting point. When\r\nsulfur gets slightly hotter than boiling water (235° to 247°\r\nFahrenheit), it melts and becomes a dark, yellowish-brown liquid.\r\n\r\nIn the Frasch method of sulfur mining, a well is drilled into the\r\nsalt-dome cap-rock, and three pipes, one inside the other, are put into\r\nthe well. Superheated water under pressure (hotter than 212° Fahrenheit,\r\nthe temperature at which water ordinarily turns into steam) is sent down\r\none of the pipes to melt the sulfur in the cap-rock around the bottom of\r\nthe well. Then, compressed air is sent down another of the pipes. This\r\nair presses against the liquid sulfur and forces it up to the surface\r\nthrough the third pipe. At the surface, the sulfur is poured into bins,\r\nwhere it cools and becomes a solid again, or it is transported molten,\r\nin pipelines and tankers.\r\n\r\nSulfur has been obtained from a number of the Texas Gulf Coast salt\r\ndomes including Bryan Mound, Clemens dome, Damon Mound, and Hoskins\r\nMound in Brazoria County; Palangana dome in Duval County; Long Point\r\ndome, Nash dome, and Orchard dome in Fort Bend County; High Island dome\r\nin Galveston County; Fannett dome and Spindletop dome in Jefferson\r\nCounty; Moss Bluff dome in Liberty County; Gulf dome in Matagorda\r\nCounty; and Boling dome in Wharton County.\r\n\r\nIn west Texas, sulfur occurs in Permian rocks both at the surface and\r\nunderground. A small amount of sulfur has been mined in the Rustler\r\nSprings area of northeastern Culberson County and northwestern Reeves\r\nCounty, about 50 miles northwest of Pecos. There, scattered grains,\r\ncrystals, and irregular masses of sulfur occur in cracks and in\r\ndissolved-out openings in the Castile Gypsum and in the surface gravel,\r\ngypsum, sand, and clay that cover most of this formation.\r\n\r\nSulfur has many uses. It is used as an insect-killer, thus helping our\r\nfood crops to grow. It is used in pulp and paper manufacturing and in\r\nthe vulcanizing of rubber. Some other uses are in the making of paints,\r\ndyes, and explosives. A large amount of sulfur goes to make sulfuric\r\nacid, which itself has numerous uses in the chemical, steel, oil\r\nrefining, and other industries.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Sulfur is obtained from the cap-rock of Gulf Coastal\r\n                Plain salt domes by the Frasch process.]\r\n\r\n  Sulfur\r\n  Uncemented Sediments\r\n  Limestone\r\n  Sulfur-Bearing Limestone\r\n  Hot Water\r\n  Melted Sulfur\r\n  Anhydrite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Talc and Soapstone\r\n\r\n\r\nTalc, a hydrous magnesium silicate, is an extremely soft mineral—your\r\nfingernail scratches it easily. It has a greasy or a pearly luster, and\r\nits color is white, light green, or gray. When rubbed across a streak\r\nplate, it leaves a white streak.\r\n\r\nTalc cleaves perfectly in one direction, and the cleavage fragments are\r\nthin, flat, and sheet-like. Its fracture is uneven. This mineral has a\r\nsoaplike or greasy feel, and it is sectile—a knife will cut through it.\r\nTalc is not particularly heavy—it has a specific gravity of 2.7 to 2.8.\r\nThis mineral seldom occurs with a crystal shape. More commonly it is\r\nmassive and is granular or layered.\r\n\r\nTalc is not always found as a single, pure mineral. In nature, it\r\ncommonly occurs mixed with one or more other minerals, such as\r\ntremolite, anthophyllite, chlorite, and magnetite. This combination of\r\ntalc with other minerals forms a soft, greasy or soapy-feeling\r\nmetamorphic rock called soapstone. The talc in this rock may be\r\ndifficult to identify without special laboratory tests.\r\n\r\nIn Texas, talc and soapstone are found in Precambrian metamorphic rocks.\r\nIn west Texas, talc occurs in an area about 20 miles long (just north of\r\nU. S. Highway 80 in the vicinity of Allamoore, Eagle Flat siding, and\r\nTalc Rock siding) in Hudspeth County. Some of this talc is mined from\r\nopen pits and used by the ceramic industry to make wall tile. Some of it\r\nis finely ground, mixed with insect poison, and used as insect powders\r\nand dusts.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Talc schist from the Allamoore area of Hudspeth County,\r\n                                Texas.]\r\n\r\nDeposits of soapstone, containing talc, occur in the Llano uplift area\r\nof central Texas with schist, gneiss, and serpentine rocks in\r\nnortheastern Gillespie, northwestern Blanco, and southern Llano\r\ncounties. Smaller deposits occur in northeastern Mason County and in\r\nnorthwestern and southeastern Llano County.\r\n\r\nThe Llano uplift area soapstones are light green to light buff. It is\r\nthought that some of them were once igneous rocks that contained\r\nmagnesium minerals. Fluids, along with great heat and pressures below\r\nthe earth’s surface, changed these igneous rocks into soapstone.\r\n\r\nSome of this Llano uplift area soapstone is mined from open pits near\r\nWillow City in Gillespie County. It is used mostly in making insect\r\npowders and roofing granules. In addition, some of the central Texas\r\nsoapstones have been used for hearths and for fireplace linings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Topaz\r\n\r\n\r\nTopaz, an aluminum fluorosilicate, is a mineral especially prized by\r\ncollectors because many specimens are gemstones. Topaz is transparent,\r\nhas a glassy luster, and is quite hard (neither quartz nor a steel file\r\nwill scratch it). The topaz that has been found in Texas is either\r\ncolorless, pale blue, or sky blue. This mineral is fairly heavy—its\r\nspecific gravity is 3.4 to 3.6. It cleaves perfectly in one direction\r\n(called basal cleavage), and some of the cleavage fragments have a flat,\r\nslabby appearance.\r\n\r\nTopaz is commonly found as prism-shaped crystals, as cleavage fragments,\r\nand as irregular grains. Some fragments of topaz look like quartz.\r\nTopaz, however, is harder and heavier than quartz, and it has perfect\r\nbasal cleavage, which quartz does not have.\r\n\r\nIn Texas, crystals, grains, and cleavage fragments of topaz occur in the\r\nLlano uplift area of central Texas. They are found near Streeter and\r\nGrit in west-central Mason County and near Katemcy in northern Mason\r\nCounty. Here, some of the topaz occurs in Precambrian pegmatite veins\r\nthat cut through granite rocks. Most of the topaz, however, is found as\r\npebbles in the gravels of nearby creeks, where it has washed after\r\nweathering out of the rocks.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Topaz crystal from near Streeter, Mason County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nTopaz probably originates when hot fluids move up out of molten magma\r\ninto cracks and cavities in the surrounding rocks. There, the fluids\r\nreact with elements in the rocks to form the topaz.\r\n\r\nTopaz is a good gemstone because, in addition to its beauty, it is hard\r\nand is not easily marred by scratches. The Mason County topaz makes\r\nexcellent gemstones. Most of it is beautiful and clear and is either\r\ncolorless or of a pleasing blue color. These stones are cut, polished,\r\nand mounted in rings and other jewelry. A number of specimens of this\r\nMason County topaz are displayed in museums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Tourmaline\r\n\r\n\r\nTourmaline is a complex silicate of boron and aluminum. Other elements,\r\nsuch as magnesium, sodium, lithium, calcium, iron, or fluorine, also may\r\nbe present. This mineral has a glassy to resinous luster. Only the\r\ndark-colored varieties of tourmaline have been found in Texas. One is a\r\nblack variety called _schorl_, and another is a brown variety called\r\n_dravite_. Other kinds of tourmaline, although not found in Texas, are\r\ncolorless or some shade of blue, yellow, red, pink, or green. Some\r\ncrystals even show more than one color.\r\n\r\nTourmaline is too hard to scratch with a steel file, it has a specific\r\ngravity of 3 to 3.25, and it has a conchoidal to uneven fracture. Very\r\nlittle light passes through the dark varieties, and some fragments of\r\nschorl look like shiny, black coal.\r\n\r\nTourmaline occurs as masses without crystal shapes, but crystals are\r\ncommonly found. The crystals are prism-shaped and have small vertical\r\ngrooves, called _striations_, on the prism faces. When you look at some\r\ncrystals from an end, you will see that the cross section is a triangle\r\nwith the sides bowed outward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Black tourmaline crystals with milky quartz from north of\r\n                      Llano, Llano County, Texas.]\r\n\r\nBoth the black and the brown varieties of tourmaline have been found at\r\nseveral places in the Llano uplift of central Texas. One well-known\r\nlocality is at Town Mountain north of Llano in Llano County. Here, the\r\ntourmaline occurs in milky quartz that is associated with Precambrian\r\ngranite rocks. In west Texas, in Culberson and Hudspeth counties, black\r\ntourmaline occurs in pegmatite rocks in the Van Horn Mountains, the\r\nCarrizo Mountains, and the Wylie Mountains. In the Eagle Mountains of\r\nHudspeth County, it is found in metamorphic rocks as well as in\r\npegmatites.\r\n\r\nSome tourmaline formed from hot fluids containing boron that were given\r\noff by magmas far below the earth’s surface. These fluids traveled up\r\nthrough cracks and other openings in overlying rocks. As the fluids\r\nreacted with other elements and compounds, the tourmaline formed.\r\n\r\nThe clear, light-colored varieties of tourmaline are much admired, and\r\nthey are more widely used as gemstones than are the dark-colored\r\nvarieties. Some collectors, however, find that the dark-colored Texas\r\ntourmalines, when cut and polished, make shiny, attractive gemstones.\r\n\r\nSome tourmaline is used as grinding material, but no Texas tourmaline is\r\nproduced for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTravertine. _See_ Calcite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         Uranium Minerals (Carnotite, Uranophane, Pitchblende)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1945, the world suddenly became aware of the awesome power of atomic\r\nenergy when the element _uranium_ was used to produce some of the first\r\natomic bombs. Uranium does not occur alone in nature but is found\r\ncombined with other elements in a number of minerals.\r\n\r\nAll of the uranium minerals are radioactive. The uranium they contain is\r\ngradually breaking down and changing into a series of 13 other elements,\r\ncalled _daughter_ elements. Each daughter element breaks down and\r\nchanges into the next daughter element of the series. While breaking\r\ndown, these elements give off particles and rays of energy.\r\n\r\nThis energy or _radioactivity_ is made up of what are called alpha\r\nparticles, beta particles, and gamma rays. You cannot see, hear, taste,\r\nsmell, or feel them. The alpha and beta particles are weak and do not\r\ntravel far. The gamma rays, however, can travel farther and can pass\r\nthrough seemingly solid material. Scientists have found that these rays\r\ncan move through about 1 foot of rock, 2½ feet of water, and several\r\nhundred feet of air.\r\n\r\nProspectors searching for uranium minerals carry instruments that are\r\nable to detect this radioactivity. The uranium itself gives off only\r\nalpha particles, but some of its daughter elements give off gamma rays.\r\nThese daughter elements are normally found with the uranium, and it is\r\ntheir strong gamma rays that the instruments are most apt to detect.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: A Geiger counter is used to detect radioactivity.]\r\n\r\nOne of the instruments used is the _Geiger counter_. It indicates\r\nradioactivity by means of a meter, a flashing light, or a clicking\r\nsound, which can be heard through earphones. Another instrument for\r\ndetecting radioactivity is the _scintillation counter_. It is more\r\nsensitive than the Geiger counter and it can detect radioactivity from a\r\ngreater distance. The scintillation counter can be used from an\r\nautomobile or an airplane, but the Geiger counter must be quite close to\r\nthe source of radioactivity to be of use.\r\n\r\nVarious uranium minerals have been found, mostly in small amounts, in a\r\nnumber of places in Texas. Some of these minerals, such as uraninite or\r\npitchblende, are heavy and dark colored. Others, including carnotite,\r\ntyuyamunite, autunite, and uranophane, are a shade of yellow or green.\r\nThey are quite soft. Deposits of the light-colored uranium minerals have\r\nbeen mined from two areas of Texas. One of these areas is in Garza\r\nCounty on the Texas High Plains, and the other is in Karnes and Live Oak\r\ncounties in the Gulf Coastal Plain.\r\n\r\nOne of the light-colored uranium minerals, _carnotite_, is a\r\npotassium-uranium vanadate, which has a bright canary-yellow or\r\nlemon-yellow color. This mineral is transparent to translucent and has\r\nan earthy or a pearly luster. Carnotite usually is found as crusts and\r\nas powdery masses. It is quite soft and can be scratched with a\r\nfingernail.\r\n\r\nCarnotite, along with tyuyamunite, autunite, and several other soft,\r\nyellowish or greenish uranium minerals, is found in the Texas Gulf\r\nCoastal Plain. These minerals occur in the Jackson, Catahoula, and\r\nOakville strata (which are Tertiary in age) in an area extending from\r\nGonzales County to the Rio Grande (in parts of the area indicated by no.\r\n2 and no. 3 on the geologic map, pp. 4-5). The largest deposits in this\r\ndistrict have been found in the Karnes County area.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf Coastal Plain uranium minerals occur mostly with sandstones and\r\nclays in a sequence of strata that contains volcanic ash. It is believed\r\nthat small scattered amounts of uranium compounds that were present in\r\nthe volcanic ash sediments were dissolved by seeping underground water.\r\nThese waters then moved into the sandstones and clays where they\r\ndeposited the uranium as carnotite and as other uranium minerals.\r\n\r\nAnother uranium mineral, _uranophane_ (calcium-uranium silicate), also\r\noccurs in Texas. Uranophane has a yellow to yellow-orange color and a\r\npearly to greasy luster. When rubbed across a streak plate, it leaves a\r\nlight yellow to a light yellow-orange streak. It is soft enough to be\r\nscratched by a copper penny. Uranophane has been found in extrusive\r\nigneous rocks in northwestern Presidio County in west Texas.\r\n\r\nA dark-colored uranium mineral, _pitchblende_, is a variety of the\r\nmineral _uraninite_, uranium dioxide. Pitchblende does not occur with a\r\ncrystal shape but rather as rounded and irregular-shaped masses. It is\r\nbrownish black, greenish black, or black. If you rub it across a streak\r\nplate, pitchblende leaves a brownish-black streak. This mineral is heavy\r\n(it has a specific gravity of 6.5 to 8.5) and hard (a pocket knife will\r\nnot scratch it, although a steel file will). Pitchblende has a\r\nsubmetallic luster and looks dull, greasy, or like pitch or tar.\r\n\r\nSmall amounts of pitchblende have been found at several places in Texas.\r\nOne of these localities is a few miles west of Burnet in Burnet County\r\nin central Texas. Here, the pitchblende occurs in Precambrian igneous\r\nrocks that are associated with gneiss. In south Texas, some fine,\r\nscattered particles of pitchblende have been found about 325 feet below\r\nthe surface in Tertiary (Pliocene) sediments that cover the Palangana\r\nsalt dome in Duval County. No pitchblende is mined in Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nUranophane. _See_ Uranium Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\nVitrophyre. _See_ Obsidian and Vitrophyre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Volcanic Ash (Pumicite)\r\n\r\n\r\nVolcanic ash deposits, which also are known as _pumicite_, are loose and\r\npowdery. They are made up mostly of material that is thrown into the air\r\nwhen volcanoes erupt. If a volcano erupts with a violent explosion, the\r\nnearby rocks are blown into powder. Molten lava also is hurled into the\r\nair, where some of it immediately cools to become tiny bubbles and\r\nparticles of glass. The winds may carry some of this fine material far\r\naway before depositing it.\r\n\r\nDeposits of volcanic ash are white, bluish, greenish, yellowish, or\r\ngrayish, and some of them glisten like snow in the sunlight. They feel\r\nrough and gritty. When examined under a microscope, this material shows\r\nthe tiny curved and sharp-cornered particles of the broken volcanic\r\nglass. Deposits of volcanic ash may also contain clay, silt, sand, or\r\nother impurities.\r\n\r\nVolcanoes, which may have been located in the Davis Mountains and in\r\nother areas of west Texas and in northern Mexico, erupted during\r\nTertiary time. The volcanic ash that we find at the surface today in\r\nsome of the Tertiary formations in Texas could have come from these\r\nvolcanoes. Tertiary volcanic ash deposits occur in the Texas Gulf\r\nCoastal Plain (such as in Brazos, Fayette, Karnes, Polk, Starr, Trinity,\r\nand other counties) and in the Trans-Pecos country of west Texas.\r\n\r\nVolcanic ash deposits of Quaternary (Pleistocene) age, which are less\r\nthan a million years old, are found in a number of counties on the Texas\r\nHigh Plains. Farther to the east, ash deposits occur in Baylor, Dickens,\r\nKent, and Wilbarger counties. This volcanic ash may have come from a\r\nvolcano that erupted in northern New Mexico during Quaternary time.\r\n\r\nVolcanic ash or pumicite has several commercial uses. Some is used to\r\nmake pozzolan cement, and some is used in sweeping compounds, cleansing\r\nand scouring powders, and abrasive soaps. Pumicite has been mined in\r\nDickens, Scurry, Starr, and several other counties of Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWad. _See_ Manganese Minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\nWood Opal. _See_ Opal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   COMPOSITION, HARDNESS, AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF SOME TEXAS MINERALS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor convenient reference, the Texas minerals described in this book are\r\nlisted below, together with their chemical compositions, specific\r\ngravities, and hardness.
