The American publishers have\r\nsupplied what was much needed, a complete Glossary of Scientific and\r\nTechnical Terms; which, with some few additions scattered through the\r\npages, and enclosed in brackets [ ], were prepared by Dr. Ruschenberger.\r\n\r\nThese additions, while they have improved the work, have added\r\nmaterially to the number and size of the pages. The publishers,\r\nconsequently, trust that it will be found more effectually suited to the\r\nwants of the private reader as well as to those of the higher classes in\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n_Philadelphia, December, 1849._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n                          TO THE NEW EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINCE the publication of the first edition of this work, the Author has\r\nbeen able to correct many inaccuracies that had crept into it, and to\r\ncollect much new matter from works since published, which is embodied in\r\nthe present edition, and has considerably added to its size. The\r\nrecently-published Second Volume of Baron Humboldt’s invaluable\r\n“Cosmos,”[1] with Colonel Sabine’s learned notes, and sundry papers that\r\nhave appeared in the scientific periodicals of Europe, America, and\r\nIndia, bearing on questions of Physical Geography, have yielded\r\nprofitable information.\r\n\r\nIt was the Author’s wish, and her Publisher’s intention, that the\r\npresent edition should be accompanied by a series of Maps to illustrate\r\nthe more important questions of Physical Geography treated of in it; but\r\nMr. A. Keith Johnston having announced the publication of a new edition\r\nof his “Physical Atlas” in a reduced size, at a low price,[2] the first\r\ntwo Nos. of which have already appeared, the project was relinquished,\r\nin the belief that Mr. A. K. Johnston’s smaller Atlas will furnish\r\nsuitable illustrations to this work.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find this edition enriched with some of the results of\r\nthe recent researches of Messrs. Campbell, Thomson, Strachey, and Dr.\r\nHooker in the Himalaya, which tend largely to elucidate the Physical\r\nHistory of that gigantic chain. The book is also indebted to Mr.\r\nPentland for some new matter, hitherto unpublished, on the countries of\r\nSouth America visited by him during his two public missions to Peru and\r\nBolivia.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the Author from England during the printing of the\r\nfollowing sheets has obliged her to have recourse to a friend conversant\r\nwith her subject to revise the press; to him she begs to express her\r\nacknowledgments, as well as to Sir William Jackson Hooker, who very\r\nkindly undertook to correct the portion of this new edition connected\r\nwith Geographical Botany and Vegetable Physiology—subjects respecting\r\nwhich he has so much contributed to extend our knowledge. Captain\r\nBeechey has been good enough to render similar service, in revising\r\ncertain passages bearing upon Hydrography.\r\n\r\n_May, 1849._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

inhabitants animal and vegetable, of the distribution of\r\nthese organized beings, and the causes of that distribution. Political\r\nand arbitrary divisions are disregarded, the sea and the land are\r\nconsidered only with respect to those great features that have been\r\nstamped upon them by the hand of the Almighty, and man himself is viewed\r\nbut as a fellow-inhabitant of the globe with other created things, yet\r\ninfluencing them to a certain extent by his actions, and influenced in\r\nreturn. The effects of his intellectual superiority on the inferior\r\nanimals, and even on his own condition by the subjection of some of the\r\nmost powerful agents in nature to his will, together with the other\r\ncauses which have had the greatest influence on his physical and moral\r\nstate, are among the most important subjects of this science.\r\n\r\nThe former state of our terrestrial habitation, the successive\r\nconvulsions which have ultimately led to its present geographical\r\narrangement, and to the actual distribution of land and water, so\r\npowerfully influential on the destinies of mankind, are circumstances of\r\nprimary importance.\r\n\r\nThe position of the earth with regard to the sun, and its connection\r\nwith the bodies of the solar system, have been noticed by the author\r\nelsewhere. It was there shown that our globe forms but an atom in the\r\nimmensity of space, utterly invisible from the nearest fixed star, and\r\nscarcely a telescopic object to the remote planets of our system. The\r\nincrease of temperature with the depth below the surface of the earth,\r\nand the tremendous desolation hurled over wide regions by numerous\r\nfire-breathing mountains, show that man is removed but a few miles from\r\nimmense lakes or seas of liquid fire. The very shell on which he stands\r\nis unstable under his feet, not only from those temporary convulsions\r\nthat seem to shake the globe to its centre, but from a slow almost\r\nimperceptible elevation in some places, and an equally gentle subsidence\r\nin others, as if the internal molten matter were subject to secular\r\ntides, now heaving and now ebbing, or that the subjacent rocks were in\r\none place expanded and in another contracted by changes of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake and the torrent, the august and terrible ministers of\r\nAlmighty Power, have torn the solid earth and opened the seals of the\r\nmost ancient records of creation, written in indelible characters on the\r\n“perpetual hills and the everlasting mountains.” There we read of the\r\nchanges that have brought the rude mass to its present fair state, and\r\nof the myriads of beings that have appeared on this mortal stage, have\r\nfulfilled their destinies, and have been swept from existence to make\r\nway for new races, which, in their turn, have vanished from the scene,\r\ntill the creation of man completed the glorious work. Who shall define\r\nthe periods of those mornings and evenings when God saw that his work\r\nwas good? and who shall declare the time allotted to the human race,\r\nwhen the generations of the most insignificant insect existed for\r\nunnumbered ages? Yet man is also to vanish in the ever-changing course\r\nof events. The earth is to be burnt up, and the elements are to melt\r\nwith fervent heat—to be again reduced to chaos—possibly to be renovated\r\nand adorned for other races of beings. These stupendous changes may be\r\nbut cycles in those great laws of the universe, where all is variable\r\nbut the laws themselves, and He who has ordained them.\r\n\r\nThe earth is one of seventeen planets which revolve about the sun in\r\nelliptical orbits: of these, twelve have been discovered since the year\r\n1787.[3] Mercury and Venus are nearer the sun than the earth, the others\r\nare more remote. The earth revolves at a mean distance of 95,000,000\r\nmiles from the sun’s centre, in a civil year of 365 days 5 hours 48\r\nminutes 49·7 seconds, at the same time that it rotates in 24 hours about\r\nan axis which always remains parallel to itself, and inclined at an\r\nangle of 23° 27ʹ 34ʺ·69 to the plane of the ecliptic; consequently, the\r\ndays and nights are of equal length at the equator, from whence their\r\nlength progressively differs more and more as the latitude increases,\r\ntill at each pole alternately there is perpetual day for six months, and\r\na night of the same duration: thus the light and heat are very unequally\r\ndistributed, and both are modified by the atmosphere by which the earth\r\nis encompassed to the height of about forty miles.\r\n\r\nWith regard to magnitude, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are\r\nlarger than the earth, the rest are smaller, but even the largest is\r\nincomparably inferior to the sun in size: his mass is 354,936 times\r\ngreater than that of the earth, but the earth is nearly four times as\r\ndense.\r\n\r\nThough the planets disturb the earth in its motion, their form has no\r\neffect on account of their great distance; but it is otherwise with\r\nregard to the moon, which revolves about the earth at a mean distance of\r\n240,000 miles, and is therefore so near that the form of both bodies\r\ncauses mutual disturbances in their respective motions. The\r\nperturbations in the moon’s motions from that cause, compared with the\r\nsame computed from theory, show that the earth is not a perfect sphere,\r\nbut that it bulges at the equator, and is flattened at the poles: it\r\neven gives a value of the compression or flattening.[4] Again, theory\r\nshows that, if the earth were throughout of the same density, it would\r\nbe much less flat at the poles than the moon’s motions show it to be,\r\nbut that it would be very nearly the same were the earth to increase\r\nregularly in density from the surface to its centre; and thus the lunar\r\nmotions not only make known the form, but reveal the internal structure\r\nof the globe. Actual measurement has proved the truth of these results.\r\n\r\nThe courses of the great rivers, which are generally navigable to a\r\nconsiderable extent, show that the curvature of the land differs but\r\nlittle from that of the ocean; and as the heights of the mountains and\r\ncontinents are inconsiderable when compared with the magnitude of the\r\nearth, its figure is understood to be determined by a surface at every\r\npoint perpendicular to the direction of gravitation, or of the\r\nplumb-line, and is the same which the sea would have if it were\r\ncontinued all round the earth beneath the continents. Such is the figure\r\nthat has been measured in various parts of the globe.\r\n\r\nA terrestrial meridian is a line passing through both poles, all the\r\npoints of which have their noon contemporaneously, and a degree of a\r\nmeridian is its 360th part. Now, if the earth were a sphere, all degrees\r\nwould be of the same length; but, as it is flattened at the poles, the\r\ndegrees are longest there, and decrease in length to the equator, where\r\nthey are least. The form and size of the earth may therefore be\r\ndetermined by comparing the length of degrees in different latitudes.[5]\r\nEleven arcs have been measured in Europe, one in Peru, and two in the\r\nEast Indies; but a comparison of no two gives the same result, which\r\nshows that the earth has a slightly irregular form. From a mean of ten\r\nof these arcs, M. Bessel found that the equatorial radius of the earth\r\nis 3963·025 miles, and the polar radius 3949·8 miles nearly. Whence,\r\nassuming the earth to be a sphere, the length of a mean degree of the\r\nmeridian is 69·05 British statute miles; therefore 360 degrees, or the\r\nwhole circumference of the globe, is 24,858 miles; the diameter, which\r\nis something less than a third of the circumference, is about 8286, or\r\n8000 statute miles; and the length of a geographical mile of 60 to a\r\ndegree is 6086·76 feet. The breadth of the torrid zone is 705\r\ngeographical miles, the breadth of each of the temperate zones is 645\r\nmiles, and that of each of the spaces within the arctic and antarctic\r\ncircles 11,431 miles nearly. The Astronomer Royal Mr. Airy’s results,\r\nobtained ten years afterwards, only differ from those of M. Bessel by\r\n127 feet in the equatorial, and 138 feet in the polar radius, quantities\r\nnot greater than the length of a ball-room. In consequence of the round\r\nform of the earth, the dip or depression of the horizon is a fathom for\r\nevery three miles of distance; that is to say, an object a fathom or six\r\nfeet high would be hid by the curvature of the earth at the distance of\r\nthree miles. Since the dip increases as the square, a hill 100 fathoms\r\nhigh, would be hid at the distance of ten miles, and the top of\r\nDhawalagori, the culminating point of the Himalaya, 28,000 feet high,\r\nwould be seen to sink beneath the horizon by a person about 167 miles\r\noff; thus, when the height is known, an estimate can be formed of the\r\ndistance of a mountain.\r\n\r\nThe oscillations of the pendulum have afforded another method of\r\nascertaining the form of the earth. Like all heavy bodies, its descent,\r\nand consequently its oscillations, are accelerated in proportion to the\r\nforce of gravitation, which increases from the equator to the poles. In\r\norder, therefore, that the oscillations may be everywhere performed in\r\nthe same time, the length of the pendulum must be increased\r\nprogressively in going from the equator to the poles, according to a\r\nknown law,[6] from whence the compression or flattening at the poles may\r\nbe deduced. Experiments for that purpose have been made in a great\r\nnumber of places, but, as in the measurement of the arcs, no two sets\r\ngive exactly the same results; the mean of the whole, however, differs\r\nvery little from that given by the degrees of the meridian and the\r\nperturbations of the moon; and as the three methods are so entirely\r\nindependent of each other, the figure and dimensions of the earth may be\r\nconsidered to be known. The sea has little effect on these experiments,\r\nboth because its mean density is less than that of the earth, and that\r\nits mean depth of perhaps four miles is inconsiderable when compared\r\nwith 4000 miles, the mean terrestrial radius.[7]\r\n\r\nThe discrepancies in the results, from the comparison of the different\r\nsets of pendulum experiments, and also of degrees of the meridian, arise\r\nfrom local attraction, as well as from irregularities in the form of the\r\nearth. These attractions, arising from dense masses of rock in\r\nmountains, cause the plumb-line to deviate from the vertical, and when\r\nunder ground they alter the oscillations of the pendulum. Colonel\r\nSabine, who made experiments with the pendulum from the equator to\r\nwithin ten degrees of the north pole, discovered that the intensity is\r\ngreatly augmented by volcanic islands. A variation to the amount of a\r\ntenth of a second in twenty-fours can be perfectly ascertained in the\r\nrate of the pendulum, but from some of these local attractions a\r\nvariation of nearly ten seconds has occurred during the same period. The\r\nislands of St. Helena, Ascension, St. Thomas, the Isle of France, are\r\nsome of those noted by Colonel Sabine.\r\n\r\nThere are other remarkable instances of local disturbance, arising from\r\nthe geological nature of the soil; for example, the intensity of\r\ngravitation is very small at Bordeaux, from whence it increases rapidly\r\nto Clermont-Ferrand, Milan, and Padua, where it attains a maximum (owing\r\nprobably to dense masses of rock under ground), and from thence it\r\nextends to Parma. In consequence of this local attraction, the degrees\r\nof the meridian in that part of Italy seem to increase towards the\r\nequator through a small space, instead of decreasing, as if the earth\r\nwere drawn out instead of flattened at the poles.\r\n\r\nIt appears from this that the effect of the whole earth on a pendulum or\r\ntorsion balance may be compared with the effect of a small part of it,\r\nand thus a comparison maybe instituted between the mass of the earth and\r\nthe mass of that part of it. Now, a leaden ball was weighed against the\r\nearth by comparing the effects of each upon a balance of torsion; the\r\nnearness of the smaller mass making it produce a sensible effect as\r\ncompared with that of the larger, for by the laws of attraction the\r\nwhole earth must be considered as collected in its centre; in this\r\nmanner a value of the mass of the earth was obtained, and, as its volume\r\nwas known, its mean density was found to be 5·675 times greater than\r\nthat of water at the temperature of 62° of Fahrenheit’s thermometer.\r\nNow, as that mean density is double that of basalt, and more than double\r\nthat of granite, rocks which undoubtedly emanate from very great depths\r\nbeneath the surface of the earth, it affords another proof of the\r\nincrease in density towards the earth’s centre. These experiments were\r\nfirst made by Mr. Cavendish and Mitchell, and latterly with much greater\r\naccuracy by M. Baily, who devoted four years of unremitted attention to\r\nthe accomplishment of this important and difficult object.[8]\r\n\r\nAlthough the earth increases in density regularly from the surface to\r\nthe centre, as might naturally be expected from the increasing pressure,\r\nyet the surface consists of a great variety of substances of different\r\ndensities, some of which occur in amorphous masses; others are disposed\r\nin regular layers or strata, either horizontal or inclined at all angles\r\nto the horizon. By mining, man has penetrated only a very little way;\r\nbut by reasoning from the dip or inclination of the strata at or near\r\nthe surface, and from other circumstances, he has obtained a pretty\r\naccurate idea of the structure of our globe to the depth of about ten\r\nmiles. All the substances of which we have any information are divided\r\ninto four classes, distinguished by the manner in which they have been\r\nformed: namely,—plutonic and volcanic rocks, both of igneous origin,\r\nthough produced under different circumstances; aqueous or stratified\r\nrocks, entirely due to the action of water, as the name implies; and\r\nmetamorphic rocks, deposited by water, according to the opinion of many\r\neminent geologists, and consequently stratified, but subsequently\r\naltered and crystallized by heat. The aqueous and volcanic rocks are\r\nformed at the surface of the earth, the plutonic and metamorphic at\r\ngreat depths; but all of them have originated simultaneously during\r\nevery geological period, and are now in a state of slow and constant\r\nprogress. The antagonist principles of fire and water have ever been and\r\nstill are the cause of the perpetual vicissitudes to which the crust of\r\nthe earth is liable.\r\n\r\nIt has been ascertained by observation that the plutonic rocks,\r\nconsisting of the granites and some of the porphyries, were formed in\r\nthe deep and fiery caverns of the earth, of melted matter, which\r\ncrystallized as it slowly cooled under enormous pressure, and was then\r\nheaved up in unstratified masses by the elastic force of the internal\r\nheat even to the tops of highest mountains, or forced in a semi-fluid\r\nstate into fissures of the superincumbent strata, sometimes into the\r\ncracks of the previously formed granite: for that rock, which\r\nconstitutes the base of so large a portion of the earth’s crust, has not\r\nbeen all formed at once; some portions had been solid, while others were\r\nyet in a liquid state. This class of rocks is completely destitute of\r\nfossil remains.\r\n\r\nAlthough granite and the volcanic rocks are both due to the action of\r\nfire, their nature and position are very different; granite, fused in\r\nthe interior of the earth, has been cooled and consolidated before\r\ncoming to the surface; besides, it generally consists of few\r\ningredients, so that it has nearly the same character in all countries.\r\nBut as the volcanic fire rises to the very surface of the earth, fusing\r\nwhatever it meets with, volcanic rocks take various forms, not only from\r\nthe different kinds of strata which are melted, but from the different\r\nconditions under which the liquid matter has been cooled, though most\r\nfrequently on the surface—a circumstance that seems to have had the\r\ngreatest effect on its appearance and structure. Sometimes it approaches\r\nso nearly to granite that it is difficult to perceive a distinction; at\r\nother times it becomes glass; in short, all those massive, unstratified,\r\nand occasionally columnar rocks, as basalt, greenstone, porphyry, and\r\nserpentine, are due to volcanic fires, and are devoid of fossil remains.\r\n\r\nThere seems scarcely to have been any age of the world in which volcanic\r\neruptions have not taken place in some part of the globe. Lava has\r\npierced through every description of rocks, spread over the surface of\r\nthose existing at the time, filled their crevices, and flowed between\r\ntheir strata. Ever changing its place of action, it has burst out at the\r\nbottom of the sea as well as on dry land. Enormous quantities of scoriæ\r\nand ashes have been ejected from numberless craters, and have formed\r\nextensive deposits in the sea, in lakes, and on the land, in which are\r\nembedded the remains of the animals and vegetables of the epoch. Some of\r\nthese deposits have become hard rock, others remain in a crumbling\r\nstate; and as they alternate with the aqueous strata of almost every\r\nperiod, they contain the fossils of all the geological epochs, chiefly\r\nfresh and salt water testaceæ.\r\n\r\nAccording to a theory now generally adopted, which originated with Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, whose works are models of philosophical investigation,\r\nthe metamorphic rocks, which consist of gneiss, micaschist, clay-slate,\r\nstatuary marble, &c., were formed of the sediment of water in regular\r\nlayers, differing in kind and colour, but, having been deposited near\r\nthe place where plutonic rocks were generated, they have been changed by\r\nthe heat transmitted from the fused matter, and, in cooling under heavy\r\npressure and at great depths, they have become as highly crystallized as\r\nthe granite itself, without losing their stratified form. An earthy\r\nstratum has sometimes been changed into a highly crystallized rock, to\r\nthe distance of a quarter of a mile from the point of contact, by\r\ntransmitted heat; and there are instances of dark-coloured limestone,\r\nfull of fossil shells, that has been changed into statuary marble from\r\nthat cause. Such alterations may frequently be seen to a small extent on\r\nrocks adjacent to a stream of lava. There is seldom a trace of organic\r\nremains in the metamorphic rocks; their strata are sometimes horizontal,\r\nbut they are usually tilted at all angles to the horizon, and form some\r\nof the highest mountains and most extensive table-lands on the face of\r\nthe globe. Although there is the greatest similarity in the plutonic\r\nrocks in all parts of the world, they are by no means identical; they\r\ndiffer in colour, and even in ingredients, though these are few.\r\n\r\nAqueous rocks are all stratified, being the sedimentary deposits of\r\nwater. They originate in the wear of the land by rain, streams, or the\r\nocean. The débris carried by running water is deposited at the bottom of\r\nthe seas and lakes, where it is consolidated, and then raised up by\r\nsubterraneous forces, again to undergo the same process after a lapse of\r\ntime. By the wasting away of the land the lower rocks are laid bare,\r\nand, as the materials are deposited in different places according to\r\ntheir weight, the strata are exceedingly varied, but consist chiefly of\r\narenaceous or sandstone rocks, composed of sand, clay, and carbonate of\r\nlime. They constitute three great classes, which, in an ascending order,\r\nare the primary and secondary fossiliferous strata and the tertiary\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nThe primary fossiliferous strata, the most ancient of all the\r\nsedimentary rocks, consisting of limestone, sandstones, and shales, are\r\nentirely of marine origin, having been formed far from land at the\r\nbottom of a very deep ocean; consequently, they contain the exuviæ of\r\nmarine animals only, and after the lapse of unnumbered ages the\r\nripple-marks of the waves are still distinctly visible on some of their\r\nstrata. This series of rocks is subdivided into the Cambrian and the\r\nupper and lower Silurian systems, on account of differences in their\r\nfossil remains.\r\n\r\nThe Cambrian rocks, sometimes many thousand yards thick, are, for the\r\nmost part, destitute of organic remains, but the Silurian rocks abound\r\nin them more and more as the strata lie higher in the series. In the\r\nlower Silurian group are the remains of shell-fish, almost all of\r\nextinct genera, and the few that have any affinity to those alive are of\r\nextinct species; crinoidea, or stone lilies, which had been fixed to the\r\nrocks like tulips on their stems, are coëval with the earliest\r\ninhabitants of the deep; and the trilobite, a jointed creature of the\r\ncrab kind, with prominent eyes, are almost exclusively confined to the\r\nSilurian strata, but the last traces of them are found in the\r\ncoal-measures above. In the upper Silurian group are abundance of marine\r\nshells of almost every order, together with crinoidea, vast quantities\r\nof corals, and some sea-weeds: several fossil sauroid fishes, of extinct\r\ngenera, but high organization, have been found in the highest beds—the\r\nonly vertebrated animals that have yet been discovered among the\r\ncountless profusion of the lower orders of creatures that are entombed\r\nin the primary fossiliferous strata. The remains of one or more land\r\nplants, in a very imperfect state, have been found in the Silurian rocks\r\nof North America, which shows that there had been land with vegetation\r\nat that early period. The type of these plants, as well as the size of\r\nthe shells and the quantity of the coral, indicate that a uniformly warm\r\ntemperature had then prevailed over the globe. During the Silurian\r\nperiod an ocean covered the northern hemisphere, islands and lands of\r\nmoderate size had just begun to rise, and earthquakes, with volcanic\r\neruptions from insular and submarine volcanos, were frequent towards its\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nThe secondary fossiliferous strata, which comprise a great geological\r\nperiod, and constitute the principal part of the high land of Europe,\r\nwere deposited at the bottom of an ocean, like the primary, from the\r\ndébris of all the others, carried down by water, and still bear\r\ninnumerable tokens of their marine origin, although they have for ages\r\nformed a part of the dry land. Calcareous rocks are more abundant in\r\nthese strata than in the crystalline, probably because the carbonic acid\r\nwas then, as it still is, driven off from the lower strata by the\r\ninternal heat, and came to the surface as gas or in calcareous springs,\r\nwhich either rose in the sea and furnished materials for shell-fish and\r\ncoral insects to build their habitations and form coral-reefs, or\r\ndeposited their calcareous matter on the land in the form of rocks.\r\n\r\nThe Devonian or old red sandstone group, in many places 10,000 feet\r\nthick, consisting of strata of dark red and other sandstones, marls,\r\ncoralline limestones, conglomerates, &c., is the lowest of the secondary\r\nfossiliferous strata, and forms a link between them and the Silurian\r\nrocks, by an analogy in their fossil remains. It has fossils peculiarly\r\nits own, but it has also some shells and corals common to the strata\r\nboth above and below it. There are various families of extinct sauroid\r\nfishes in this group, some of which were gigantic, others had strong\r\nbony shields on their heads, and one genus, covered with enamelled\r\nscales, had appendages like wings. The shark approaches nearer to some\r\nof these ancient fish than any other now living.\r\n\r\nDuring the long period of perfect tranquility that prevailed after the\r\nDevonian group was deposited, a very warm, moist, and extremely equable\r\nclimate, which extended all over the globe, had clothed the islands and\r\nlands in the ocean then covering the northern hemisphere with exuberant\r\ntropical forests and jungles. Subsequent inroads of fresh water, or of\r\nthe sea, or rather partial sinkings of the land, had submerged these\r\nforests and jungles, which, being mixed with layers of sand and mud, had\r\nin time been consolidated into one mass, and were then either left dry\r\nby the retreat of the waters or gently raised above their surface.\r\n\r\nThese constitute the remarkable group of the carboniferous strata, which\r\nconsists of numberless layers of various substances filled with a\r\nprodigious quantity of the remains of fossil land-plants, intermixed\r\nwith beds of coal, which is entirely composed of vegetable matter. In\r\nsome cases, the plants appear to have been carried down by floods, and\r\ndeposited in estuaries; but in most instances the beauty, delicacy, and\r\nsharpness of the impressions show that they had grown on the spot where\r\nthe coal was formed. More than 300 fossil plants have been collected\r\nfrom the strata where they abound, frequently with their seeds and\r\nfruits, so that enough remains to show the peculiar nature of this\r\nflora, whose distinguishing feature is the preponderance of ferns; among\r\nthese there were tree-ferns which must have been 40 or 50 feet high.\r\nThere were also plants resembling the horse-tail tribe, of gigantic\r\nsize, others like the tropical club mosses; an aquatic plant of an\r\nextinct family was very abundant, beside many others to which we have\r\nnothing analogous. Forest-trees of great magnitude, of the pine and fir\r\ntribes, flourished at that period. The remains of an extinct araucaria,\r\none of the largest of the pine family, have been found in the British\r\ncoal-fields; the existing species now grow in very warm countries; a few\r\nrare instances occur of grasses, palms, and liliaceous plants. The\r\nbotanical districts were very extensive when the coal-plants were\r\ngrowing, for the species are nearly identical throughout the coal-fields\r\nof Europe and America. From the extent of the ocean, the insular\r\nstructure of the land, the profusion of ferns and fir-trees, and the\r\nwarm, moist, and equable climate, the northern hemisphere during the\r\nformation of the coal strata is thought to have borne a strong\r\nresemblance to the South Pacific, with its fern and fir clothed lands of\r\nNew Zealand, Kerguelen islands, and others.\r\n\r\nThe animal remains of this period are in the mountain limestone, a rock\r\noccasionally 900 feet thick, which in some instances lies beneath the\r\ncoal-measures, and sometimes alternates with the shale and sandstone.\r\nThey consist of crinoidea and marine testaceæ, among which the size of\r\nthe chambered shells, as well as that of the corals, shows that the\r\nocean was very warm at that time, even in the high northern latitudes.\r\nThe footsteps of a very large reptile of the frog tribe have been found\r\non some of the carboniferous strata of North America.\r\n\r\nThe coal strata have been very much broken and deranged in many places\r\nby earthquakes, which frequently occurred during the secondary\r\nfossiliferous period, and from time to time raised islands and land from\r\nthe deep. However, these and all other changes that have taken place on\r\nthe earth have been gradual and partial, whether brought about by fire\r\nor water. The older rocks are more shattered by earthquakes than the\r\nnewer, because the movement came from below; but these convulsions have\r\nnever extended all over the earth at the same time—they have always been\r\nlocal: for example, the Silurian strata have been dislocated and tossed\r\nin Britain, while a vast area in the south of Sweden and Russia still\r\nretains a horizontal position. There is no proof that any mountain-chain\r\nhas ever been raised at once; on the contrary, the elevation has always\r\nbeen produced by a long-continued and reiterated succession of internal\r\nconvulsions with intervals of repose. In many instances the land has\r\nrisen up or sunk down by an imperceptible equable motion continued for\r\nages, while in other places the surface of the earth has remained\r\nstationary for long geological periods.\r\n\r\nThe magnesian limestone, or permian formation, comes immediately above\r\nthe coal-measures, and consists of breccias or conglomerates, gypsum,\r\nsandstone, marl, &c.; but its distinguishing feature is a yellow\r\nlimestone rock, containing carbonate of magnesia, which often takes a\r\ngranular texture, and is then known as dolomite. The permian formation\r\nhas a fossil flora and fauna peculiar to itself, mingled with those of\r\nthe coal strata. Here the remnant of an earlier creation gradually tends\r\nto its final extinction, and a new one begins to appear. The flora is,\r\nin many instances, specifically the same with that in the coal strata\r\nbelow. Certain fish are also common to the two, which never appear\r\nagain. They belong to a race universal in the early geological periods,\r\nand bear a strong resemblance to saurian reptiles. A small number of\r\nexisting genera only, such as the shark and sturgeon, make some approach\r\nto the structure of these ancient inhabitants of the waters. The new\r\ncreation is marked by the introduction of two species of saurian\r\nreptiles; the fossil remains of one have been found in the magnesian\r\nlimestone in England, and those of the other in a corresponding\r\nformation in Germany. They are the earliest members of a family which\r\nwas to have dominion on the land and water for ages.\r\n\r\nA series of red marls, rock-salt, and sandstones, which have arisen from\r\nthe disintegration of metamorphic slates and porphyritic trap,\r\ncontaining oxide of iron, and known as the trias or new red sandstone\r\nsystem, lies above the magnesian limestone. In England this formation is\r\nparticularly rich in rocksalt, which, with layers of gypsum and marl, is\r\nsometimes 600 feet thick; but in this country the muschelkalk, a\r\npeculiar kind of shell limestone, is wanting, which in Germany is so\r\nremarkable for the quantity of organic remains. At this time creatures\r\nlike frogs, of enormous dimensions, had been frequent, as they have left\r\ntheir footsteps on what must then have been a soft shore. Forty-seven\r\ngenera of fossil remains have been found in the trias in Germany,\r\nconsisting of shells, cartilaginous fish, encrinites, &c., all distinct\r\nin species, and many distinct in genera, from the organic fossils of the\r\nmagnesian limestone below, and also from those entombed in the strata\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nDuring a long period of tranquility the oolite or Jurassic group was\r\nnext deposited in a sea of variable depth, and consists of sands,\r\nsandstones, marls, clays, and limestone. At this time there was a\r\ncomplete change in the aqueous deposits all over Europe. The red\r\niron-stained arenaceous rocks, the black coal, and dark strata, were\r\nsucceeded by light-blue clays, pale-yellow limestones, and, lastly,\r\nwhite chalk. The water that deposited the strata must have been highly\r\ncharged with carbonate of lime, since few of the formations of that\r\nperiod are without calcareous matter, and calcareous rocks were formed\r\nto a prodigious extent throughout Europe; the Pyrenees, Alps, Apennines,\r\nand Balkan abound in them; and the Jura mountains, which have given\r\ntheir name to the series, are formed of them. The European ocean then\r\nteemed with animal life; whole beds consist almost entirely of marine\r\nshells and corals. Belemnites and ammonites, from an inch in diameter to\r\nthe size of a cart-wheel, are entombed by myriads in the strata: whole\r\nforests of that beautiful zoophyte the stone-lily flourished on the\r\nsurface of the oolite, then under the waters; and the encrinite, one of\r\nthe same genus, is embedded in millions in the enchorial shell-marble,\r\nwhich occupies such extensive tracts in Europe. Fossil fish are numerous\r\nin these strata, but different from those of the coal series, the\r\npermian formation, and trias: not one genus of the fish of this period\r\nis now in existence. The newly-raised islands and lands were clothed\r\nwith vegetation like that of the large islands of the intertropical\r\narchipelagos of the present day, which, though less rich than during the\r\ncarboniferous period, still indicates a very moist and warm climate.\r\nFerns were less abundant, and they were associated with various genera\r\nand species of the cicadeæ, which had grown on the southern coast of\r\nEngland, and in other parts of northern Europe, congeners of the present\r\ncycas and zamia of the tropics. These plants had been very numerous, and\r\nthe pandanæ, or screw-pine, the first tenant of the new lands in ancient\r\nand modern times, is a family found in a fossil state in the inferior\r\noolite of England, which was but just rising from the deep at that time.\r\nThe species now flourishing grows only on the coasts of such coral\r\nislands in the Pacific as have recently emerged from the waves. In the\r\nupper strata of this group, however, the confervæ and monocotyledonous\r\nplants become more rare—an indication of a change of climate.\r\n\r\nThe new lands that were scattered on the ocean of the oolite period were\r\ndrained by rivers, and inhabited by huge crocodiles and saurian reptiles\r\nof gigantic size, mostly of extinct genera. The crocodiles come nearest\r\nto modern reptiles; but the others, though bearing a remote similitude\r\nin general structure to living forms, were quite anomalous, combining in\r\none the structure of various distinct creatures, and so monstrous that\r\nthey must have been more like the visions of a troubled dream than\r\nthings of real existence; yet in organization a few of them came nearer\r\nto the type of living mammalia than any existing reptiles do. Some of\r\nthese had lived in rivers, others in the ocean—some were inhabitants of\r\nthe land, others were amphibious; and the various species of one genus\r\neven had wings like a bat, and fed on insects. There were both\r\nherbivorous and predaceous saurians; and from their size and strength\r\nthey must have been formidable enemies. Besides, the numbers deposited\r\nare so great, that they must have swarmed for ages in the estuaries and\r\nshallow seas of the period, especially in the lias, a marine stratum of\r\nclay, the lowest of the oolite series. They gradually declined towards\r\nthe end of the secondary fossiliferous epoch; but as a class they lived\r\nin all subsequent eras, and still exist in tropical countries, although\r\nthe species are very different from their ancient congeners. Tortoises\r\nof various kinds were contemporary with the saurians, also a family that\r\nstill exists. In the Stonefield slate, a stratum of the lower oolite\r\ngroup, there are the remains of insects, and the bones of two small\r\nquadrupeds have been found there belonging to the marsupial tribe, such\r\nas the opossum—a very remarkable circumstance, because that family of\r\nanimals at the present time is confined to New Holland, South America,\r\nand as far north as Pennsylvania at least. The great changes in animal\r\nlife during this period were indications of the successive alterations\r\nthat had taken place on the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nThe cretaceous strata follow the oolite in ascending order, consisting\r\nof clay, green and iron sands, blue limestone, and chalk, probably\r\nformed of the decay of coral and shells, which predominates so much in\r\nEngland and other parts of Europe, that it has given the name and its\r\npeculiar feature to the whole group. It is, however, by no means\r\nuniversal; the chalk is wanting in many parts of the world where the\r\nother strata of this series prevail, and then their connection with the\r\ngroup can only be ascertained by the identity of their fossil remains.\r\nWith the exception of some beds of coal among the oolitic series, the\r\nWealden clay, the lowest of the cretaceous group in England, is the only\r\nfresh-water formation, and the tropical character of its flora shows\r\nthat the climate was still very warm. Plants allied to the zamias and\r\ncycades of our tropical regions, many ferns and pines of the genus\r\naraucaria, characterized its vegetation, and the upright stems of a\r\nfossil forest at Portland show that it had been covered with trees. It\r\nwas inhabited by tortoises approaching to families now living in warm\r\ncountries, and saurian reptiles of five different genera swarmed in the\r\nlakes and estuaries. This clay contains fresh-water shells and fish of\r\nthe carp kind. The Wealden clay is one of the various instances of the\r\nsubsidence of land which took place during this period.\r\n\r\nThe cretaceous strata above our Wealden clay are full of marine exuviæ.\r\nThere are vast tracts of sand in Northern Europe, and many very\r\nextensive tracts of chalk; but in the southern part of the Continent the\r\ncretaceous rocks assume a different character. There and elsewhere\r\nextensive limestone rocks, filled with very peculiar shells, show that,\r\nwhen the cretaceous strata were forming, an ocean extended from the\r\nAtlantic into Asia, which covered the south of France, all Southern\r\nEurope, part of Syria, the isles of the Ægean Sea, the coasts of Thrace\r\nand the Troad. The remains of turtles have been found in the cretaceous\r\ngroup, quantities of coral, and abundance of shells of extinct species;\r\nsome of the older kinds still existed, new ones were introduced, and\r\nsome of the most minute species of microscopic shells, which constitute\r\na large portion of the chalk, are supposed to be the same with creatures\r\nnow alive, the first instance of identity of species in the ancient and\r\nmodern creation. An approximation to recent times is to be observed also\r\nin the arrangement of organized nature, since at this early period, and\r\neven in the Silurian and oolitic epochs, the marine fauna was divided,\r\nas now, into distinct geographical provinces. The great saurians were on\r\nthe decline, and many of them were found no more, but a gigantic\r\ncreature, intermediate between the monitor and iguana, lived at this\r\nperiod. From the permian group to the chalk inclusive, only two\r\ninstances of fossil birds occur, one in a chalk deposit in the Swiss\r\nAlps, and the other a kind of albatross in the chalk in England; in\r\nNorth America, however, the foot-marks of a variety of birds have been\r\nfound in the strata between the coal and lias, some of which are larger\r\nthan those of the ostrich.\r\n\r\nAn immense geological cycle elapsed between the termination of the\r\nsecondary fossiliferous strata and the beginning of the tertiary. With\r\nthe latter a new order of things commenced, approaching more closely to\r\nthe actual state of the globe. During the tertiary formation the same\r\ncauses under new circumstances produced an infinite variety in the order\r\nand kind of the strata, accompanied by a corresponding change in the\r\nanimal and vegetable life. The old creation, which had nothing in common\r\nwith the existing order of things, had passed away and given place to\r\none more nearly approaching to that which now prevails. Among the\r\nmyriads of beings that inhabited the earth and the ocean during the\r\nsecondary fossiliferous epoch, scarcely one species is to be found in\r\nthe tertiary. Two planets could hardly differ more in their natural\r\nproductions. This break in the law of continuity is the more remarkable,\r\nas hitherto some of the newly-created animals were always introduced\r\nbefore the older were extinguished. The circumstances and climate suited\r\nto the one became more and more unfit for the other, which consequently\r\nperished gradually, while their successors increased. It is possible\r\nthat, as observations become more extended, this hiatus maybe filled up.\r\n\r\nThe series of rocks, from the granite to the end of the secondary\r\nfossiliferous strata, taken as a whole, constitute the solid crust of\r\nthe globe, and in that sense are universally diffused over the earth’s\r\nsurface. The tertiary strata occupy the hollows formed in this crust,\r\nwhether by subterraneous movements, by lakes, or denudation by water, as\r\nin the estuaries of rivers, and consequently occur in irregular tracts,\r\noften, however, of prodigious thickness and extent. Indeed, they seem to\r\nhave been as widely developed as any other formation, though time has\r\nbeen wanting to bring them into view.\r\n\r\nThe innumerable basins and hollows with which the continents and larger\r\nislands had been indented for ages after the termination of the\r\nsecondary fossiliferous series had sometimes been fresh-water lakes, and\r\nat other times inundated by the sea; consequently, the deposits which\r\ntook place during these changes alternately contain the spoils of\r\nterrestrial and marine animals. The frequent intrusion of volcanic\r\nstrata among the tertiary formations shows that, in Europe, the earth\r\nhad been in a very disturbed state, and that these repeated vicissitudes\r\nhad been occasioned by elevations and depressions of the soil, as well\r\nas by the action of water.\r\n\r\nThere are three distinct groups in these strata: the lowest tertiary or\r\nEocene group, so called by Sir Charles Lyell, because, among the myriads\r\nof fossil shell-fish it contains, very few are identical with those now\r\nliving; the Miocene, or middle group, has a greater number of the exuviæ\r\nof existing species of shells; and the Pleiocene, or upper tertiary\r\ngroup, still more. Though frequently heaved up to great elevations on\r\nthe flanks of the mountain-chains, as, for example, on the Alps and\r\nApennines, by far the greater part of the tertiary strata maintain their\r\noriginal horizontal position in the very places where they were formed.\r\nImmense insulated deposits of this kind are to be met with all over the\r\nworld; Europe abounds with them, London, Paris, and Vienna stand on such\r\nbasins, and they cover immense tracts both in North and South America.\r\n\r\nThe monstrous reptiles had mostly disappeared, and the mammalia now took\r\npossession of the earth, of forms scarcely less anomalous than their\r\npredecessors, though approaching more nearly to those now living.\r\n\r\nNumerous species of extinct animals that lived during the earliest or\r\nEocene period have been found in various parts of the world, especially\r\nin the Paris basin, of the order of Pachydermata, to the greater number\r\nof which we have nothing analogous; they were mostly herbivorous\r\nquadrupeds, which had frequented the borders of the rivers and lakes\r\nthat covered the greater part of Europe at that time. This is the more\r\nextraordinary, as existing animals most similar to these, the tapirs for\r\ninstance, are confined to the torrid zone. These creatures were widely\r\ndiffused, and some of them were associated with genera still existing,\r\nthough of totally different species; such as animals allied to the\r\nracoon and dormouse, the ox, bear, deer, the fox, the dog, and others.\r\nAlthough these quadrupeds differ so widely from those of the present\r\nday, the same proportion existed then as now between the carnivorous and\r\nherbivorous genera. The spoils of marine mammalia of this period have\r\nalso been found, sometimes of great elevations above the sea, all of\r\nextinct species, and some of these cetacea were of huge size. This\r\nmarvellous change of the creative power was not confined to the earth\r\nand the ocean; the air also was now occupied by many extinct races of\r\nbirds allied to the owl, buzzard, quail, curlew, &c. The climate must\r\nstill have been warmer than at present, from the remains of land and sea\r\nplants found in high latitudes. Even in England, bones of the opossum,\r\nmonkey, and boa have been discovered, all animals of warm countries,\r\nbesides fossil sword and saw fish, both of genera foreign to the British\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nDuring the Miocene period, new amphibious quadrupeds were associated\r\nwith the old, of which the deinotherium is the most characteristic and\r\nmuch the largest of the mammalia yet found, far surpassing the largest\r\nelephant in size, of a singular form, and unknown nature.\r\n\r\nThe palæotherium was of this period, and also the mastodon, both of\r\nlarge dimensions. Various families, and even genera, of quadrupeds now\r\nexisting were associated with these extraordinary creatures, though of\r\nextinct species, such as the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, tapir,\r\nhorse, bear, wolf, hyæna, weasel, beaver, ox, buffalo, deer, &c.; and\r\nalso marine mammalia, as dolphins, sea-calves, walruses, and lamantines.\r\nIndeed, in the constant increase of animal life manifested throughout\r\nthe whole of the tertiary strata, the forms approach nearer to living\r\nspecies as their remains lie high in the series.\r\n\r\nIn the older Pleiocene period some of the large amphibious quadrupeds,\r\nand other genera of mammalia of the earlier tertiary periods, appear no\r\nmore; but there were the mastodon, and the Elephas primigenius or\r\nmammoth, some species of which, of prodigious size, were associated with\r\nnumerous quadrupeds of existing genera, but lost species. Extinct\r\nspecies of almost all the quadrupeds now alive seem to have inhabited\r\nthe earth at that time; their bones have been discovered in caverns;\r\nthey were embedded in the breccias and in most of the strata of that\r\nepoch—as the hippopotamus, rhinoceros, elephant, horse, bear, wolf,\r\nwater-rat, hyæna, and various birds. It is remarkable that in the\r\ncaverns of Australia the fossil bones all belong to extinct species of\r\ngigantic kangaroos and wombats, animals belonging to the marsupial\r\nfamily, which are so peculiarly the inhabitants of that country at the\r\npresent day, but of diminished size. The newer Pleiocene strata show\r\nthat the same analogy existed between the extinct and recent mammalia of\r\nSouth America, which, like their living congeners, as far as we know,\r\nbelonged to that continent alone; for the fossil remains, quite\r\ndifferent from those in the old world, are of animals of the same\r\nfamilies with the sloths, anteaters, and armadilloes which now inhabit\r\nthat country, but of vastly superior size and different species. In\r\nfact, there were giants in the land in those days. Were change of\r\nspecies possible, one might almost fancy that these countries had\r\nescaped the wreck of time, and that their inhabitants had pined and\r\ndwindled under the change of circumstances. The megatherium and Equus\r\ncurvidens, or extinct horse, had so vast a range in America, that, while\r\nSir Charles Lyell collected their bones in Georgia in 33° N. latitude,\r\nMr. Darwin brought them from the corresponding latitude in South\r\nAmerica. The Equus curvidens differed as much from the living horse as\r\nthe quagga or zebra does, and the European fossil horse is also probably\r\na distinct and lost species.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the fossil remains with the living forms has shown the\r\nanalogy between these beings of the ancient world and those that now\r\npeople the earth; and the greatest triumph of the geologist is the\r\ncertainty with which he can decide upon the nature of animals that have\r\nbeen extinct for thousands of years, from a few bones entombed on the\r\nearth’s surface. Baron Cuvier will ever be celebrated as the founder of\r\nthis branch of comparative anatomy, and which Professor Owen has brought\r\nto the highest perfection. Among many discoveries, he has found, by the\r\nmost minute microscopic observation, that the structure of the tissue of\r\nwhich teeth are formed is different in different classes of animals, and\r\nthat the species can in many instances be determined from the fragment\r\nof a tooth. A small portion of a bone enabled him to decide on the\r\nnature of an extinct race of birds, and the subsequent discovery of the\r\nwhole skeleton confirmed the accuracy of this determination.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the land in the northern hemisphere was elevated\r\nabove the deep during the tertiary period, and such lands as already\r\nexisted acquired additional height; consequently the climate, which had\r\npreviously been tropical, became gradually colder, for an increase of\r\nland, which raises the temperature between the tropics, has exactly the\r\ncontrary effects in higher latitudes. Hence, excessive cold prevailed\r\nduring the latter part of the Pleiocene period, and a great part of the\r\nEuropean continent was covered by an ocean full of floating ice, not\r\nunlike that seen at this day off the north-eastern coast of America.[9]\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the Pleiocene period, however, the bed of that\r\nglacial ocean rose partially, and after many vicissitudes the European\r\ncontinent assumed nearly the form it now bears. There is every reason to\r\nbelieve that the glacial sea extended also over great portions of the\r\narctic lands of Asia and America. Old forms of animal and vegetable life\r\nwere destroyed by these alterations in the surface of the earth, and the\r\nconsequent change of temperature; and when, in the progress of the\r\nPleiocene period, the mountain-tops appeared as islands above the water,\r\nthey were clothed with the flora and peopled by the animals they still\r\nretain; and new forms were added as the land rose and became dry and\r\nfitted to receive and maintain the races of animals now alive, all of\r\nwhich had possession of the earth for ages prior to the historical or\r\nhuman period. Some of the extinct animals had long resisted the great\r\nvicissitudes of the times; of these the mammoth or Elephas primigenius,\r\nwhose fossil remains are found all over Europe, Asia, and America, but\r\nespecially in the gelid soil of Siberia, alone outlived its associates,\r\nthe last remnant of a former world. In two or three instances this\r\nanimal has been discovered entire, entombed in frozen mud, with its hair\r\nand its flesh so fresh that wolves and dogs fed upon it. The globe of\r\nthe eye of one found by M. Middendorf at Tas, between the rivers Oby and\r\nJenesei, was so perfect that it is now preserved in the museum at\r\nMoscow. It has been supposed that, as the Siberian rivers flow for\r\nhundreds of miles from the southern part of the country to the Arctic\r\nOcean, these elephants might have been drowned by floods while browsing\r\nin the milder regions, and that their bodies were carried down by the\r\nrivers and embedded in mud, and frozen before they had time to decay.\r\nMr. Darwin has suggested that, if the climate of Siberia has at any time\r\nbeen similar to that of the high latitudes of South America, where the\r\nline of perpetual snow in the Andes, and its sudden flexure in Southern\r\nChile, come close to a nearly tropical vegetation, such a vegetation may\r\nhave prevailed south of the frozen regions in Siberia, and,\r\nconsequently, the bodies of animals entombed a few feet below the icy\r\nsurface might be preserved for ages. On the other hand, although the\r\ncongeners of this animal are now inhabitants of the torrid zone, they\r\nmay have been able to endure the cold of a Siberian winter, for Baron\r\nCuvier found that this animal differed as much from the living elephant\r\nas the horse does from the ass. Mr. Darwin has shown that the supply of\r\nfood in summer was probably sufficient, since the quantity requisite for\r\nthe maintenance of the larger animals is by no means in proportion to\r\ntheir bulk, or it may have migrated to a more genial climate in the\r\ncolder months.\r\n\r\nShell-fish seem to have been more able to endure all the great\r\ngeological changes than any of their organic associates, but they show a\r\nconstant approximation to modern species during the progress of the\r\ntertiary period. The whole of these strata contain enormous quantities\r\nof shells of extinct species; in the oldest, three and a half per cent.\r\nof the shells are identical with species now existing, while on the\r\nuppermost strata of this geological period there are not less than from\r\nninety to ninety-five in a hundred identical with those now alive.\r\n\r\nOf all the fossil fishes, from the Silurian strata to the end of the\r\ntertiary, scarcely one is specifically the same with living forms: the\r\nMallotus villosus, or captan, of the salmon family, is an exception, and\r\nperhaps a few others of the most recent of these periods. In the Eocene\r\nstrata one-third belong to extinct genera.\r\n\r\nUnder the vegetable mould in every country there is a stratum of loose\r\nsand, gravel, and mud, lying upon the subjacent rocks, often of great\r\nthickness, called alluvium, which in the high latitudes of North America\r\nand Europe is mixed with enormous fragments of rock, sometimes angular\r\nand sometimes rounded and water-worn, which have been transported\r\nhundreds of miles from their origin. It is there known as the Boulder\r\nformation, or Northern Drift, because, from the identity of the boulders\r\nwith the rocks of the northern mountains, they evidently have come from\r\nthem, and their size becomes less as the distance increases. In Russia\r\nthere are blocks of great magnitude that have been carried 800 and even\r\n1000 miles south-east from their origin in the Scandinavian range. There\r\nis much reason to believe that such masses, enormous as they are, have\r\nbeen transported by ice-bergs, and deposited when the northern parts of\r\nthe continents were covered by the glacial sea, by which part of Russia\r\nwas submerged to the depth of at least 1000 feet. The same process is\r\nnow in progress in the high southern latitudes, where icebergs have been\r\nmet with covered with fragments of rock and boulders.[10]\r\n\r\nThe last manifestation of creative power, with few exceptions, differs\r\nspecifically from all that preceded it; the recent strata contain only\r\nthe exuviæ of animals now living, often mixed with the works of man.\r\n\r\nThe solid earth thus tells us of mountains washed down into the sea with\r\ntheir forests and inhabitants; of lands raised from the bottom of the\r\nocean loaded with the accumulated spoils of centuries; of torrents of\r\nwater and torrents of fire. In the ordinances of the heavens no voice\r\ndeclares a beginning, no sign points to an end; in the bosom of the\r\nearth, however the dawn of life appears, the time is obscurely marked\r\nwhen first living things moved in the waters, when the first plants\r\nclothed the land. There we see that during ages of tranquillity the\r\nsolid rock was forming at the bottom of the ocean, that during ages it\r\nwas tossed and riven by fire and earthquake. What years must have gone\r\nby since that ocean flowed which has left its ripple-marks on the sand,\r\nnow a solid mass on the mountain—since those unknown creatures left\r\ntheir foot-prints on the shore, now fixed by time on the rock for ever!\r\ntime, which man measures by days and years, nature measures by thousands\r\nof centuries.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the fossiliferous strata up to the end of the tertiary\r\nformation has been estimated at about seven or eight miles; so that the\r\ntime requisite for their deposition must have been immense. Every river\r\ncarries down mud, sand, or gravel, to the sea: the Ganges brings more\r\nthan 700,000 cubic feet of mud every hour, the Yellow River in China\r\n2,000,000,[11] and the Mississippi still more; yet, notwithstanding\r\nthese great deposits, the Italian hydrographer Manfredi has estimated\r\nthat, if the sediment of all the rivers on the globe were spread equally\r\nover the bottom of the ocean, it would require 1000 years to raise its\r\nbed one foot, so that at that rate it would require 3,960,000 years to\r\nraise the bed of the ocean alone to a height nearly equal to the\r\nthickness of the fossiliferous strata, or seven miles and a half, not\r\ntaking account of the waste of the coasts by the sea itself: but if the\r\nwhole globe be considered, instead of the bottom of the sea only, the\r\ntime would be nearly four times as great, even supposing as much\r\nalluvium to be deposited uniformly both with regard to time and place,\r\nwhich it never is. Besides, in various places the strata have been more\r\nthan once carried to the bottom of the ocean, and again raised above its\r\nsurface by subterranean fires after many ages, so that the whole period\r\nfrom the beginning of the primary fossiliferous strata to the present\r\nday must be great beyond calculation, and only bears comparison with the\r\nastronomical cycles, as might naturally be expected, the earth being\r\nwithout doubt of the same antiquity with the other bodies of the solar\r\nsystem. What then shall we say if the time be included which the\r\ngranitic, metamorphic, and recent series occupied in forming? These\r\ngreat periods of time correspond wonderfully with the gradual increase\r\nof animal life and the successive creation and extinction of numberless\r\norders of being, and with the incredible quantity of organic remains\r\nburied in the crust of the earth in every country on the face of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nEvery great geological change in the nature of the strata was\r\naccompanied by the introduction of a new race of beings, and the gradual\r\nextinction of those that had previously existed, their structure and\r\nhabits being no longer fitted for the new circumstances in which these\r\nchanges had placed them. The change, however, never was abrupt; and it\r\nmay be observed that there is no proof of progressive development of\r\nspecies by generation from a low to a high organization, for animals and\r\nplants of high organization appeared among the earliest of their kind,\r\nyet throughout the whole, the gradual approach to living and more\r\nperfect forms is undoubted, not by change of species, but by increasing\r\nsimilarity of type.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of animated beings was much more extensive\r\nin the ancient seas and land than in latter times. In very remote ages\r\nthe same animal inhabited the most distant parts of the sea: the\r\ncorallines built from the equator to within ten or fifteen degrees of\r\nthe pole; and previous to the formation of the carboniferous strata\r\nthere appears to have been even a greater uniformity in the vegetable\r\nthan in the animal world, though New Holland had formed even then a\r\npeculiar district, supposing the coal in that country to be of the same\r\nepoch as in Europe and America; but as the strata became more varied,\r\nspecies were less widely diffused. Some of the saurians were inhabitants\r\nof both the Old and New World, while others lived in the latter only.\r\nDuring the tertiary period, the animals of Australia and America\r\ndiffered nearly as much from those of Europe as they do at the present\r\nday. The world was then, as now, divided into great physical regions,\r\neach inhabited by a peculiar race of animals; and even the different\r\nspecies of mollusca of the same sea were confined to certain shores. Of\r\n405 species of shell-fish which inhabited the Atlantic Ocean during the\r\nearly and middle parts of the tertiary period, only 12 were common to\r\nthe American and European coasts. In fact, the divisions of the animal\r\nand vegetable creation into geographical districts had been in the\r\nlatter periods contemporaneous with the rise of the land, each portion\r\nof which, as it rose above the deep, had been clothed with a vegetation\r\nand peopled with creatures suited to its position with regard to the\r\nequator, and to the existing circumstances of the globe; and the marine\r\ncreatures had, no doubt, been divided into districts at the same\r\nperiods, because the bed of the ocean had been subject to similar\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of fossil remains is so great that, with the exception of\r\nthe metals and some of the primary rocks, probably not a particle of\r\nmatter exists on the surface of the earth that has not at some time\r\nformed part of a living creature. Since the commencement of animated\r\nexistence, zoophytes have built coral reefs extending hundreds of miles,\r\nand mountains of limestone are full of their remains all over the globe.\r\nMines of shells are worked to make lime; ranges of hills and rocks, many\r\nhundred feet thick, are almost entirely composed of them, and they\r\nabound in every mountain-chain throughout the earth. The prodigious\r\nquantity of microscopic shells discovered by M. Ehrenberg is still more\r\nastonishing; shells not larger than a grain of sand form entire\r\nmountains; a great portion of the hills of San Casciano, in Tuscany,\r\nconsist of chambered shells so minute that Signor Soldani collected\r\n10,454 of them from one ounce of stone. Chalk is often almost entirely\r\ncomposed of them. Tripoli, a fine powder long in use for polishing\r\nmetals, is also almost wholly composed of shells which owe their\r\npolishing property to their siliceous coats; and there are even hills of\r\ngreat extent consisting of this substance, the débris of an infinite\r\nvariety of microscopic insects.\r\n\r\nThe facility with which many clays and slates are split is owing, in\r\nsome instances, to layers of minute shells. Fossil fish are found in all\r\nparts of the world, and in all the fossiliferous strata, with the\r\nexception of some of the lowest, but each great geological period had\r\nspecies of fish peculiar to itself.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the great saurians are innumerable; those of extinct\r\nquadrupeds are very numerous; but there is no circumstance in the whole\r\nscience of fossil geology more remarkable than the inexhaustible\r\nmultitudes of fossil elephants that are found in Siberia. Their tusks\r\nhave been an object of traffic in ivory for centuries, and in some\r\nplaces they have been in such prodigious quantities, that the ground is\r\ntainted with the smell of animal matter. Their huge skeletons are found\r\nfrom the frontier of Europe through all Northern Asia to its extreme\r\neastern point, and from the foot of the Altaï mountains to the shores of\r\nthe Frozen Ocean, a surface equal in extent to the whole of Europe. Some\r\nislands in the Arctic Sea, as, for instance, the first of the Lächow\r\ngroup, are chiefly composed of their remains, mixed with the bones of\r\nvarious other animals of living genera, but extinct species.[12]\r\n\r\nEqually wonderful is the quantity of fossil plants that still remain, if\r\nit be considered that, from the frail nature of many vegetable\r\nsubstances, multitudes must have perished without leaving a trace\r\nbehind. The vegetation that covered the terrestrial part of the globe\r\nprevious to the formation of the carboniferous strata had far surpassed\r\nin exuberance the rankest tropical jungles. There are many coal-fields\r\nof great extent in various parts of the earth, especially in North\r\nAmerica, where that of Pittsburg occupies an area of about 14,000 square\r\nmiles, and that in the Illinois is not much inferior to the area of all\r\nEngland.[13]\r\n\r\nAs coal is entirely a vegetable substance, some idea may be formed of\r\nthe richness of the ancient flora: in latter times it was less\r\nexuberant, and never has again been so luxuriant, probably on account of\r\nthe decrease of temperature during the deposition of the tertiary\r\nstrata, and in the glacial period which immediately preceded the\r\ncreation of the present tribes of plants and animals. Even after their\r\nintroduction the temperature must have been very low, but by subsequent\r\nchanges in the distribution of the sea and land the cold was gradually\r\nmitigated, till at last the climate of the northern hemisphere became\r\nwhat it now is.\r\n\r\nSuch is the marvellous history laid open to us on the earth’s surface.\r\nSurely it is not the heavens only that declare the glory of God—the\r\nearth also proclaims His handiwork![14]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDirection of the Forces that raised the Continents—Proportion of Land\r\n  and Water—Size of the Continents and Islands—Outline of the Land—\r\n  Extent of Coasts, and proportion they bear to the Areas of the\r\n  Continents—Elevation of the Continents—Forms of Mountains—Forms of\r\n  Rocks—Connection between Physical Geography of Countries and their\r\n  Geological Structure—Contemporaneous Upheaval of parallel Mountain\r\n  Chains—Parallelism of Mineral Veins or Fissures—Mr. Hopkins’s Theory\r\n  of Fissures—Parallel Chains similar in Structure—Interruptions in\r\n  Continents and Mountain Chains—Form of the Great Continent—The High\r\n  Lands of the Great Continent—The Atlas, Spanish, French, and German\r\n  Mountains—The Alps, Balkan, and Apennines—Glaciers—Geological Notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the end of the tertiary period the earth was much in the same state\r\nas it is at present with regard to the distribution of land and water.\r\nThe preponderance of land in the northern hemisphere indicates a\r\nprodigious accumulation of internal energy under these latitudes at a\r\nvery remote geological period. The forces that raised the two great\r\ncontinents above the deep, when viewed on a wide scale, must evidently\r\nhave acted at right angles to one another, nearly parallel to the\r\nequator in the old continent, and in the direction of the meridian in\r\nthe new; yet the structure of the opposite coasts of the Atlantic points\r\nat some connection between the two.\r\n\r\nThe mountains, from their rude and shattered condition, bear testimony\r\nto repeated violent convulsions similar to modern earthquakes; while the\r\nhigh table-lands, and that succession of terraces by which the\r\ncontinents sink down from their mountain-ranges to the plains, to the\r\nocean, and even below it, show also that the land must have been heaved\r\nup occasionally by slow and gentle pressure, such as appears now to be\r\ngradually elevating the coast of Scandinavia and many other parts of the\r\nearth. The periods in which these majestic operations were effected must\r\nhave been incalculable, since the dry land occupies an area of nearly\r\n38,000,000 of square miles.\r\n\r\nThe ocean covers nearly three-fourths of the surface of the globe, but\r\nthe distribution is very unequal, whether it be considered with regard\r\nto the northern and southern hemispheres, or the eastern and western.\r\nIndependently of Victoria Land, whose extent is unknown, the quantity of\r\nland in the northern hemisphere is three times greater than in the\r\nsouthern. In the latter it occupies only one-sixteenth of the space\r\nbetween the Antarctic Circle and the thirtieth parallel of south\r\nlatitude, while between the corresponding parallels in the northern\r\nhemisphere the extent of land and water is nearly equal. If the globe be\r\ndivided into two hemispheres by a meridian passing through the island of\r\nTeneriffe, the land will be found to predominate greatly on the eastern\r\nside of that line, and the water on the western. In consequence of the\r\nvery unequal arrangement of the solid and liquid portions of the surface\r\nof the earth, England is nearly in the centre of the greatest mass of\r\nland, and its antipode, the island of New Zealand, is in the centre of\r\nthe greatest mass of water; so that a person raised above Falmouth,\r\nwhich is almost the central point, till he could perceive a complete\r\nhemisphere, would see the greatest possible expanse of land, while, were\r\nhe elevated to the same height above New Zealand, he would see the\r\ngreatest possible extent of ocean. In fact, only one twenty-seventh of\r\nthe land has land directly opposite to it in the opposite hemisphere,\r\nand under the equator five-sixths of the circumference of the globe is\r\nwater. It must, however, be observed that there is still an unexplored\r\nregion within the Antarctic Circle more than twice the size of Europe,\r\nand of the north polar basin we know nothing. With regard to the land\r\nalone, the great continent has an area of about 24,000,000 square miles,\r\nwhile the extent of America is 11,000,000, and that of Australia with\r\nits islands scarcely 3,000,000. Africa is more than three times the size\r\nof Europe, and Asia is more than four times as large. The extent of the\r\ncontinents is twenty-three times greater than that of all the islands\r\ntaken together.[15]\r\n\r\nOf the polar lands little is known. Greenland probably is part of a\r\ncontinent, the domain of perpetual snow; and the recent discovery of so\r\nextensive a mass of high volcanic land near the south pole is an\r\nimportant event in the history of physical science, though the stern\r\nseverity of the climate must for ever render it unfit for the abode of\r\nanimated beings, or even for the support of vegetable life. It seems to\r\nform a counterpoise to the preponderance of dry land in the northern\r\nhemisphere. There is something sublime in the contemplation of these\r\nlofty and unapproachable regions—the awful realm of ever-during ice and\r\nperpetual fire, whose year consists of one day and one night. The\r\nstrange and terrible symmetry in the nature of the lands within the\r\npolar circles, whose limits are to us a blank, where the antagonist\r\nprinciples of cold and heat meet in their utmost intensity, fills the\r\nmind with that awe which arises from the idea of the unknown and the\r\nindefinite.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the land to assume a peninsular form is very remarkable,\r\nand it is still more so that almost all the peninsulas tend to the\r\nsouth—circumstances that depend on some unknown cause which seems to\r\nhave acted very extensively. The continents of South America, Africa,\r\nand Greenland, are peninsulas on a gigantic scale, all tending to the\r\nsouth; the Asiatic peninsula of India, the Indo-Chinese peninsula, those\r\nof Corea, Kamtchatka, of Florida, California, and Aliaska, in North\r\nAmerica, as well as the European peninsulas of Norway and Sweden, Spain\r\nand Portugal, Italy and Greece, take the same direction. All the latter\r\nhave a rounded form except Italy, whereas most of the others terminate\r\nsharply, especially the continents of South America and Africa, India,\r\nand Greenland, which have the pointed form of wedges; while some are\r\nlong and narrow, as California, Aliaska, and Malacca. Many of the\r\npeninsulas have an island or group of islands at their extremity, as\r\nSouth America, which terminates with the group of Tierra del Fuego:\r\nIndia has Ceylon; Malacca has Sumatra and Banca; the southern extremity\r\nof New Holland ends in Van Dieman’s Land; a chain of islands run from\r\nthe end of the peninsula of Aliaska; Greenland has a group of islands at\r\nits extremity; and Sicily lies close to the termination of Italy. It has\r\nbeen observed as another peculiarity in the structure of peninsulas that\r\nthey generally terminate boldly, in bluffs, promontories, or mountains,\r\nwhich are often the last portions of the continental chains. South\r\nAmerica terminates in Cape Horn, a high promontory, which is the visible\r\ntermination of the Andes; Africa with the Cape of Good Hope; India with\r\nCape Comorin, the last of the Ghauts; New Holland ends with South-East\r\nCape in Van Dieman’s Land; and Greenland’s farthest point is the\r\nelevated bluff of Cape Farewell.[16]\r\n\r\nThere is a strong analogy between South America and Africa in form and\r\nthe unbroken mass which their surface presents, while North America\r\nresembles Europe, in being much indented by inland seas, gulfs, and\r\nbays. Eastern Asia is evidently continued in a subaqueous continent from\r\nthe Indian Ocean across the Pacific nearly to the west coast of America,\r\nof which New Holland, the Indian Archipelago, the islands of the Asiatic\r\ncoast and of Oceania, are the great table-lands and summits of its\r\nmountain-chains. With the exception of a vast peninsula in Siberia,\r\nbetween the mouths of the rivers Yenesei and Khatanga and the unknown\r\nregions of Greenland, the two great continents terminate in a very\r\nbroken line to the north; and as they sink beneath the Icy Ocean, the\r\ntops of their high lands and mountains rise above the waves and stud the\r\ncoast with innumerable snow-clad rocks and islands. The 70th parallel is\r\nthe average latitude of these northern shores, which have a great\r\nsimilarity on each side of Behring’s Straits in form, direction, and in\r\nthe adjacent islands.\r\n\r\nThe peninsular form of the continents adds greatly to the extent of\r\ntheir coasts, of such importance to civilization and commerce. All the\r\nshores of Europe are deeply indented and penetrated by the Atlantic\r\nOcean, which has formed a number of inland seas of great magnitude, so\r\nthat it has a greater line of maritime coast, compared with its size,\r\nthan any other quarter of the world. The extent of coast from the\r\nStraits of Waigatz, in the Polar Ocean, to the Strait of Caffa, at the\r\nentrance of the Sea of Azoff, is about 17,000 miles. The coast of Asia\r\nhas been much worn by currents, and possibly also by the action of the\r\nocean occasioned by the rotation of the earth from west to east. On the\r\nsouth and east especially it is indented by large seas, bays, and gulfs;\r\nand the eastern shores are rugged and encompassed by chains of islands\r\nwhich render navigation dangerous. Its maritime coast is about 33,000\r\nmiles in length.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Africa, 16,000 miles long, is very entire, except perhaps\r\nat the Gulf of Guinea and in the Mediterranean. The shores of North\r\nAmerica have probably been much altered by the equatorial current and\r\nthe Gulf-stream. There is little doubt that these currents, combined\r\nwith volcanic action, have hollowed out the Gulf of Mexico, and\r\nseparated the Antilles and Bahama Islands from the continent. The coast\r\nis less broken on the west, but in the Icy Ocean there is a labyrinth of\r\ngulfs, bays, and creeks. The shores of South America on both sides are\r\nvery entire, except towards Southern Chile and Cape Horn, where the\r\ntremendous surge and currents of the ocean in those high latitudes have\r\neaten into the mountains, and produced endless sounds and fiords which\r\nrun far into the land. The whole continent of America has a sea-coast of\r\n31,000 miles. Thus, it appears that the ratio of the number of linear\r\nmiles in the coast-line to the number of square miles in the extent of\r\nsurface, in each of these great portions of the globe, is 164 for\r\nEurope, 376 for Asia, 530 for Africa, and 359 for America. Hence, the\r\nproportion is most favourable to Europe, with regard to civilization and\r\ncommerce; America comes next, then Asia, and last of all Africa, which\r\nhas every natural obstacle to contend with, from the extent and nature\r\nof its coasts, the desert character of the country, and the insalubrity\r\nof its climate, on the Atlantic coast at least.\r\n\r\nThe continents had been raised from the deep by a powerful effort of the\r\ninternal forces acting under widely-extended regions, and the stratified\r\ncrust of the earth either remained level, rose in undulations, or sank\r\ninto cavities, according to its intensity. Some thinner portion of the\r\nearth’s surface, giving way to the internal forces, had been rent into\r\ndeep fissures, and the mountain masses had been raised by violent\r\nconcussions, perceptible in the convulsed state of their strata. The\r\ncentres of maximum energy are marked by the pyrogenous rocks, which\r\ngenerally form the nucleus or axis of the mountain masses, on whose\r\nflanks the stratified rocks are tilted at all angles to the horizon,\r\nwhence, declining on every side, they sink to various depths, or stretch\r\nto various distances in the plains. Enormous as the mountain-chains and\r\ntable-lands are, and prodigious as the forces that elevated them, they\r\nbear a very small proportion to the mass of the level continents and to\r\nthe vast power which raised them even to their inferior altitude. Both\r\nthe high and the low lands had been elevated at successive periods; some\r\nof the very highest mountain-chains are but of recent geological date,\r\nand some chains that are now far inland once stood up as islands above\r\nthe ocean, while marine strata filled their cavities and formed round\r\ntheir bases. The influence of mountain-chains on the extent and form of\r\nthe continents is beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the various circumstances of their elevation, there is\r\neverywhere a certain regularity of form in mountain masses, however\r\nunsymmetrical they may appear at first, and rocks of the same kind have\r\nidentical characters in every quarter of the globe. Plants and animals\r\nvary with climate, but a granite mountain has the same peculiarities in\r\nthe southern as in the northern hemisphere—at the equator as near the\r\npoles. Single mountains, insulated on plains, are rare, except where\r\nthey are volcanic; they generally appear in groups intersected by\r\nvalleys in every direction, and more frequently in extensive chains\r\nsymmetrically arranged in a series of parallel ridges, separated by\r\nnarrow longitudinal valleys, the highest and most rugged of which occupy\r\nthe centre: when the chain is broad and of the first order in point of\r\nmagnitude, peak after peak arises in endless succession. The lateral\r\nridges and valleys are constantly of less elevation, and are less bold,\r\nin proportion to their distance from the central mass, till at last the\r\nmost remote ridges sink down into gentle undulations. Extensive and\r\nlofty branches diverge from the principal chains at various angles, and\r\nstretch far into the plains. They are often as high as the chains from\r\nwhich they spring, and it happens not unfrequently that these branches\r\nare united by transverse ridges, so that the country is often\r\nwidely-covered by a net-work of mountains, and, at the point where these\r\noffsets diverge, there is frequently a knot of mountains spreading over\r\nhundreds of square miles.\r\n\r\nOne side of a mountain range is usually more precipitous than the other,\r\nbut there is nothing in which the imagination misleads the judgment more\r\nthan in estimating the steepness of a declivity. In the whole range of\r\nthe Alps there is not a single rock which has 1600 feet of perpendicular\r\nheight, or a vertical slope of 90°. The declivity of Mont Blanc towards\r\nthe Allée Blanche, precipitous as it seems, does not amount to 45°; and\r\nthe mean inclination of the peak of Teneriffe, according to Baron\r\nHumboldt, is only 12° 30ʹ. The Silla of Caraccas, which rises\r\nprecipitously from the Caribbean Sea, at an angle of 53° 28ʹ, to the\r\nheight of between 6000 and 7000 feet, is a majestic instance of perhaps\r\nthe nearest approach to perpendicularity of any great height yet known.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of elevation are not the only causes of that variety\r\nobserved in the summits of mountains. A difference in the composition\r\nand internal structure of a rock has a great influence upon its general\r\nform, and on the degree and manner in which it is worn by the weather.\r\nThus dolomite assumes generally the form of peaks like saw-teeth;\r\ncrystalline schists assume the form of needles, as in the Alps; slates\r\nand quartziferous schists take the form of triangular pyramids;\r\ncalcareous rocks a rounded shape; serpentine and trachyte are often\r\ntwisted and crumpled; phonolites assume a pyramidal form; dark walls\r\nlike those in Greenland are of trap and basalt; and volcanoes are\r\nindicated by blunt cones and craters. Thus, the mountain-peaks often\r\nindicate by their form their geological nature.\r\n\r\nViewing things on a broad scale, it appears that there is also a very\r\nstriking connection between the physical geography or external aspect of\r\ndifferent countries and their geological structure. By a minute\r\ncomparison of the different parts of the land, M. Boué has shown that a\r\ncritical similarity of outward forms, while indicating similarity in the\r\nproducing causes, must also, to a large extent, indicate identity of\r\nstructure, and therefore from the external appearance of an unexplored\r\ncountry its geological structure may be inferred, at least to a certain\r\nextent. This he illustrates by pointing out a correspondence, even in\r\ntheir most minute details, between the leading features of Asia and\r\nEurope, and the identity of their geological structure. It has been\r\njustly observed, that when the windings of our continents and seas are\r\nnarrowly examined, and the more essential peculiarities of their\r\ncontours contemplated, it is evident that Nature has not wrought after\r\nan indefinite number of types or models, but that, on the contrary, her\r\nfundamental types are very few, and derived from the action of definite\r\nconstructive forces on a primary base.[17] The whole of our land and\r\nsea, in fact, may be decomposed into a less or greater number of masses,\r\neither exhibiting all these fundamental forms or merely a portion of\r\nthem.[18] The peninsular structure of the continents with their\r\naccompanying islands is a striking illustration of the truth of this\r\nremark, and many more might be adduced. It follows, as a consequence of\r\nthat law in Nature’s operations, that analogy of form and contour throws\r\nthe greatest light on the constitution of countries far removed from\r\neach other. Even the picturesque descriptions of a traveller often\r\nafford information of which he may be little aware.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the contemporaneous upheaval of parallel\r\nmountain-chains, by a comparison of the ages of the inclined and\r\nhorizontal strata resting on them, is one of the highest steps of\r\ngeneralization which has been attempted by geologists. It was first\r\nobserved by the miners of the Freyberg school, and established as a law\r\nby Werner, that veins of the same nature in mines occur in parallel\r\nfissures opened at the same time, and probably filled with metal, also\r\nsimultaneously, at a subsequent period; and that fissures differing in\r\ndirection differ also in age. As these veins and fissures are rents\r\nthrough the solid strata, often of unfathomable depth and immense\r\nlength, there is the strongest analogy between them and those enormous\r\nfissures in the solid mass of the globe through which the\r\nmountain-chains have been heaved up. Were the analogy perfect, it ought\r\nto follow that parallel mountain-chains have been raised simultaneously,\r\nthat is, by forces acting during the same geological periods. By a\r\ncareful examination of the relative ages of the strata resting on the\r\nflanks of many of the mountain systems, M. Elie de Beaumont has shown,\r\nif not proved, that all strata elevated simultaneously assume a parallel\r\ndirection, or, that parallel strata are contemporaneous. Should this be\r\nconfirmed, parallel chains in the most distant regions will no longer be\r\nregarded as insulated masses. They will indicate the course of enormous\r\nfissures that have simultaneously rent the solid globe and passed\r\nthrough the bed of the ocean from continent to continent, from island to\r\nisland. M. Von Buch has found that four systems of mountains in Germany\r\naccord with this theory, and Mr. Sedgwick has observed the same in the\r\nWestmoreland system of mountains, believed to be the most ancient of\r\nwhich the globe can now furnish any traces. This theory of elevation of\r\nmountain-chains, which originated with M. Elie de Beaumont, has already\r\nled to the discovery of twelve different periods of fracture and\r\nelevation in the European continent alone.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins, of Cambridge, has taken a purely mathematical view of the\r\nsubject, and has proved that, when an internal expansive force acts\r\nupwards upon a single point in the earth’s crust, the splits or cracks\r\nmust all diverge from that point like radii in a circle, which is\r\nexactly the case in many volcanic districts; that when the expansive\r\nforce acts uniformly from below on a wide surface or area, it tends to\r\nstretch the surface, so that it would split or crack where the tension\r\nis greatest, that is, either in the direction of the length or breadth;\r\nand if the area yields in more places than one, he found that the\r\nfissures would necessarily be parallel to one another, which agrees with\r\nthe law of arrangement of veins in mines. These results are greatly\r\nmodified by the shape of the area, but the modification is according to\r\na fixed law, which, instead of interfering with that of the parallelism\r\nof the fissures, actually arises from the same action which produces it.\r\nThis investigation agrees in all its details with the fractures in the\r\ndistricts in England to which they were applied, so that theory comes to\r\nthe aid of observation in this still unsettled question.[19]\r\n\r\nIt seems to bear on the subject, that parallel mountain-chains are\r\nsimilar in geological age, even when separated by seas. For instance,\r\nthe mountains of Sweden and Finland are of the same structure, though\r\nthe Gulf of Bothnia is between them; those of Cornwall, Brittany, and\r\nthe north-west of Spain are similar; the Atlas and the Spanish\r\nmountains, the chains in California and those on the adjacent coast of\r\nAmerica, and, lastly, those of New Guinea and the north-east of\r\nAustralia, furnish examples. The same correspondence in geological epoch\r\nprevails in chains that are not parallel, but that are convergent from\r\nthe form of the earth. This observation is also extensively exemplified\r\nin those that run east and west, as the Alps, the Balkan, Taurus,\r\nParopamisus with its prolongation, the Hindoo Coosh, the Himalaya, and\r\nin America the mountains of Parima and the great chain of Venezuela.\r\n\r\nContinents and mountain-chains are often interrupted by posterior\r\ngeological changes, such as clefts and cavities formed by erosion, as\r\nevidently appears from the correspondence of the strata. The chalk\r\ncliffs on the opposite sides of the British Channel show that Britain\r\nonce formed part of the continent; the formation of the Orkney Islands\r\nand Ireland is the same with that of the Highlands of Scotland; the\r\nformation is the same on each side of the Straits of Gibraltar; that of\r\nTurkey in Europe passes into Asia Minor, the Crimea into the Caucasus, a\r\nvolcanic region bounds the Straits of Babelmandel, and Behring’s Straits\r\ndivide the ancient strata of a similar age. This is particularly the\r\ncase with coast islands.[20]\r\n\r\nImmediately connected with the mountains are the high table-lands which\r\nform so conspicuous a feature in the Asiatic and American continents.\r\nThese perpetual storehouses of the waters send their streams to refresh\r\nthe plains, and to afford a highway between the nations. Table-lands of\r\nless elevation, sinking in terraces of lower and lower level, constitute\r\nthe links between the high ground and the low, the mountains and the\r\nplains, and thus maintain the continuity of the land. They frequently\r\nare of the richest soil, and enjoy the most genial climate, affording a\r\ndelightful and picturesque abode to man, though the plains are his\r\nprincipal dwelling. Sloping imperceptibly from the base of the inferior\r\ntable-lands, or from the last undulations of the mountains, to the\r\nocean, they carry off the superfluous waters. Fruitfulness and sterility\r\nvary their aspect: immense tracts of the richest soil are favoured by\r\nclimate, and hardly require culture; a greater portion is only rendered\r\nproductive by hard labour, compelling man to fulfil his destiny; while\r\nvast regions are doomed to perpetual barrenness, never gladdened by a\r\nshower.\r\n\r\nThe form of the great continent has been determined by an immense zone\r\nof mountains and table-lands, lying between the 30th and 40th or 45th\r\nparallels of north latitude, which stretches across it from W.S.W. to\r\nE.N.E., from the coasts of Barbary and Portugal, on the Atlantic Ocean,\r\nto the farthest extremity of Asia, at Behring’s Straits, in the North\r\nPacific. North of this lies a vast plain, extending almost from the\r\nPyrenees to the utmost parts of Asia, the greater portion of which is a\r\ndead level, or low undulations, uninterrupted except by the Scandinavian\r\nand British system on the north, and the Ural chain, which is of small\r\nelevation. The low lands south of the mountainous zone are much indented\r\nby the ocean, and of the most diversified aspect. By much the greater\r\npart of the flat country lying between the China Sea and the river Indus\r\nis of the most exuberant fertility, while that between the Persian Gulf\r\nand the foot of the Atlas is, with some happy exceptions, one of the\r\nmost desolate tracts on the earth. The southern lowlands, too, are\r\nbroken by a few mountain systems of considerable extent and height.\r\n\r\nThe Atlas and Spanish mountains form the western extremity of that great\r\nzone of high lands that girds the old continent almost throughout its\r\nextent: these two mountain systems were certainly at one time united,\r\nand from their geological formation, and also the parallelism of their\r\nmountain-chains, they must have been elevated by forces acting in the\r\nsame direction; now, indeed, the Strait of Gibraltar, a sea-filled chasm\r\n960 fathoms deep, divides them.[21]\r\n\r\nA very elevated and continuous mountain region extends in a broad belt\r\nalong the north-west of Africa, from the promontory of Gher, on the\r\nAtlantic, to the Gulf of Sidra, in the Mediterranean, enclosing all the\r\nhigh lands of Morocco, Algiers, and Tunis. It is bounded by the Atlantic\r\nand Mediterranean, and insulated from the rest of Africa by the desert\r\nof Sahara.\r\n\r\nThis mountain system consists of three parts. The chain of the Greater\r\nAtlas, which is farthest inland, extends from Cape Gher, on the\r\nAtlantic, to the Lesser Syrtis; and, in Morocco, forms a knot of\r\nmountains 15,000 feet high, covered with perpetual snow.\r\n\r\nThe Lesser Atlas begins at Cape Spartel (the ancient Cape Cotes)\r\nopposite to Gibraltar, and keeps parallel to the Mediterranean till it\r\nattains the Gharian range in Tripoli, the last and lowest of the Little\r\nAtlas, which runs due east in a uniformly diminishing line till it\r\nvanishes in the plain of the Great Syrtis. That long, rugged, but lower\r\nchain of parallel ridges and groups which forms the bold coasts of the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean, is only a portion of the\r\nLesser Atlas, which rises above it majestically, covered with snow. The\r\nflanks of the mountains are generally clothed with forests, but their\r\nsummit is one uninterrupted line of bare inaccessible rocks, and they\r\nare rent by fissures frequently not more than a few feet wide—a peculiar\r\nfeature of the whole system.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Atlas, lying between the two great chains, consists of a\r\ntable-land, rich in valleys and rivers, which rises in successive\r\nterraces to the foot of the Greater Atlas, separated by ridges of hills\r\nparallel to it. This wide and extensive region has a delightful climate,\r\nabounds in magnificent forests, and the valleys are full of vitality.\r\nThe crest of the Atlas is of granite and crystalline strata; their\r\nflanks and lower ranges are sandstone and limestone, on which the\r\ntertiary strata rest.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish peninsula consists chiefly of a table-land traversed by\r\nparallel ranges of mountains, and is surrounded by the sea, except where\r\nit is separated from France by the Pyrenees, which extend from the\r\nMediterranean to the Bay of Biscay, but are continued by the Cantabrian\r\nchain to Cape Finisterre on the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe Pyrenean chain is of moderate height at its extremities, but its\r\nsummit maintains a waving line, whose mean altitude is 7990 feet; it\r\nrises to a greater height on the east; its highest point is the Malahite\r\nor Nethou, 11,170 feet above the sea. The snow lies deep on these\r\nmountains during the greater part of the year, and is perpetual on the\r\nhighest parts; but the glaciers, which are chiefly on the northern side,\r\nare neither so numerous nor so large as in the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe greatest breadth of this range is about 60 miles, and its length\r\n270. It is so steep on the French side, so rugged and so notched, that\r\nfrom the plains below its summits look like the teeth of a saw, whence\r\nthe term Sierra has been appropriated to mountains of this form. On the\r\nSpanish side, gigantic sloping offsets, separated by deep precipitous\r\nvalleys, extend to the banks of the Ebro. All the Spanish mountains are\r\ntorn by deep crevices, the beds of torrents and rivers.\r\n\r\nThe interior of Spain is a table-land with an area of 93,000 square\r\nmiles, nearly equal to half of the peninsula. It dips to the Atlantic\r\nfrom its western side, where its altitude is about 2300 feet. There it\r\nis bounded by the Iberian mountains, which begin at the point where the\r\nPyrenees take the name of the Cantabrian chain, and run in a tortuous\r\nsouth-easterly direction through all Spain, constituting the eastern\r\nboundary of Valencia and Murcia, and sending many branches through those\r\nprovinces to the Mediterranean: its most elevated point is the Sierra\r\nUrbion.\r\n\r\nFour nearly parallel ranges of mountains originate in this limiting\r\nchain, running from E.N.E. to W.S.W. diagonally across the peninsula to\r\nthe Atlantic. Of these, the high Castilian chain of the Guadarama and\r\nthe Sierra de Toledo cross the table-land, the Sierra Morena, so called\r\nfrom the dingy colour of its forests of Hermes oak, on the southern\r\nedge; and lastly, the Sierra Nevada, though only 100 miles long and 50\r\nbroad, the finest range of mountains in Europe after the Alps, traverses\r\nthe plains of Andalusia and Grenada. The table-land is monotonous and\r\nbare of trees; the plains of Old Castile are as naked as the Steppes of\r\nSiberia, and uncultivated, except along the banks of the rivers. Corn\r\nand wine are produced in abundance on the wide plains of New Castile and\r\nEstremadura: other places serve for pasture. The table-land becomes more\r\nfertile as it extends towards Portugal, which is altogether more\r\nproductive than Spain, though the maritime provinces of the latter on\r\nthe Mediterranean are luxuriant and beautiful, with a semi-tropical\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nGranite, crystalline strata, and primary fossiliferous rocks prevail\r\nchiefly in the Spanish mountains, and give them their peculiar, bold,\r\nserrated aspect. The valleys between the parallel ranges, through which\r\nthe great Spanish rivers flow to the Atlantic, appear to have been at\r\none time the basins of lakes.\r\n\r\nThe mass of high land is continued through the south of France, at a\r\nmuch lower elevation, by chains of hills and table-lands, the most\r\nremarkable of which are the Montagnes Noires, and the great plateau of\r\nAuvergne, once the theatre of violent volcanic action. It continued from\r\nthe beginning to the middle of the tertiary period, so that there are\r\ncones and craters of various ages and perfect form: some of the highest,\r\nas the Puy de Dôme, are trachytic domes of elevation; Mont d’Or, 6200\r\nfeet high, is a portion of an immense crater of elevation.[22] The\r\nvolcanic mountains of Auvergne, and the Cévennes, which are a little\r\nlower, are the most remarkable of the French system; the offsets of the\r\nlatter reach the right bank of the Rhone. In fact, the French mountains\r\nare the link between the more elevated masses of Western and Eastern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe eastern and highest part of the European portion of the\r\nmountain-zone begins to rise above the low-lands about the 52d parallel\r\nof north latitude, ascending by terraces, groups, and chains of\r\nmountains, through six or seven degrees of latitude, till it reaches its\r\nhighest point in the great range of the Alps and Balkan. The descent on\r\nthe south side of this lofty mass is much more rapid and abrupt, and the\r\nimmediate offsets from the Alps shorter; but, taking a very general\r\nview, the Apennines and mountains of Northern Sicily, those of Greece\r\nand the southern part of Turkey in Europe, with all the islands of the\r\nadjacent coasts, are but outlying members of the general protuberance.\r\n\r\nThe principal chain of the Hyrcanian mountains, the Sudetes, and the\r\nCarpathian mountains, form the northern boundary of these high lands:\r\nthe first, consisting of three parallel ridges, extends from the right\r\nbank of the Rhine to the centre of Germany, about 51° or 52° of N. lat.,\r\nwith a mean breadth of about 100 miles, and terminates in the knot of\r\nthe Fichtelberge, covering an area of 9000 square miles, on the confines\r\nof Bavaria and Bohemia. The Sudetes begin on the east of this group,\r\nand, after a circuit of 300 miles round Bohemia, terminate at the small\r\nelevated plain of the Upper Oder, which connects them with the\r\nCarpathian mountains. No part of these limiting ranges attains the\r\nheight of 5000 feet, except the Carpathians, some of which are very\r\nhigh. They consist of mountain-groups united by elevated plains, rather\r\nthan of a single chain: the Tatra mountains, bisected by the 20th\r\nmeridian, is their loftiest point. This range is high also in\r\nTransylvania, before it reaches the Danube, which divides it from a\r\nsecondary branch of the Balkan. Spurs decline in undulations from these\r\nlimiting chains on the great northern plain, and the country to the\r\nsouth, intervening between them and the Alps, is covered with an\r\nintricate network of mountains and plains of moderate elevation.\r\n\r\nThe higher Alps, which form the western crest of the elevated zone, may\r\nbe said to begin at the Cape della Melle on the Gulf of Genoa, and bend\r\nround by the west and north to Mont Blanc; then turning E.N.E. they run\r\nthrough the Grisons and Tyrol to the Great Glockner, in 40° 7ʹ N. lat.,\r\nand 12° 43ʹ E. long., where the higher Alps terminate a course 420 miles\r\nlong. All this chain is lofty; much of it is above the line of perpetual\r\ncongelation; the most elevated part lies between the Col de la Seigne,\r\non the western shoulder of Mont Blanc, and the Simplon. The highest\r\nmountains in Europe are comprised within this space, not more than 60\r\nmiles long, where Mont Blanc, the highest of all, has an absolute\r\nelevation of 15,759·8 feet. The central ridge of the higher Alps is\r\njagged with peaks, pyramids, and needles of bare and almost\r\nperpendicular rock, rising from fields of perpetual snow and rivers of\r\nice to an elevation of 14,000 feet. Many parallel chains and groups,\r\nalike rugged and snowy, press on the principal crest, and send their\r\nflanks far into the lower grounds. Innumerable secondary branches,\r\nhardly lower than the main crest, diverge from it in various directions;\r\nof these, the chain of the Bernese Alps is the highest and most\r\nextensive. It breaks off at the St. Gothard, in a line parallel to the\r\nprincipal chain, separates the Valais from the Canton of Berne, and with\r\nits ramifications forms one of the most remarkable groups of mountain\r\nscenery in Europe. Its endless maze of sharp ridges and bare peaks,\r\nmixed with gigantic masses of pure snow, fading coldly serene into the\r\nblue horizon, present a scene of sublime quiet and repose, unbroken but\r\nby the avalanche or the thunder.\r\n\r\nAt the Great Glockner the range of the Alps, hitherto undivided, splits\r\ninto two branches, the Noric and Carnic Alps: the latter is the\r\ncontinuation of the chief stem. Never rising to the height of perpetual\r\nsnow, it separates the Tyrol and Upper Carinthia from the Venetian\r\nStates, and, taking the name of the Julian Alps at Mont Terglou, runs\r\neast till it joins the Eastern Alps, or Balkan, under the 18th meridian.\r\nOffsets from this chain cover all the neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the width of the Alpine chain: that of the\r\nhigher Alps is about 100 miles; it increases to 150 east of the Grisons,\r\nand amounts to 200 between the 15th and 16th meridians, but is not more\r\nthan 80 at its junction with the Balkan.\r\n\r\nThe Stelvio, 9174 feet above the sea, is the highest carriage-pass in\r\nthese mountains. That of St. Gothard goes directly over the crest of the\r\nAlps. Passes very rarely go over the summit of a mountain; they\r\ngenerally cross the watershed, ascending by the valley of a torrent, and\r\ndescending by a similar path on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe frequent occurrence of extensive deep lakes is a peculiar feature in\r\nEuropean mountains, rarely to be met with in the Asiatic system, except\r\nin the Altaï and on the elevated plains.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Jura, whose pastoral summit is about 3000 feet\r\nabove the sea, there are no elevated table-lands in the Alps: the\r\ntabular form, so eminently characteristic of the Asiatic high lands,\r\nbegins in the Balkan. The Oriental peninsula rises by degrees from the\r\nDanube to Bosnia and Upper Macedonia, which are some hundred feet above\r\nthe sea; and the Balkan extends 600 miles along this elevated mass, from\r\nthe Julian Alps to Cape Eminec on the Black Sea. It begins by a\r\ntable-land 70 miles long, traversed by low hills, ending, towards\r\nAlbania and Myritida, in precipitous limestone rocks from 6000 to 7000\r\nfeet high. Rugged mountains, all but impassable, succeed to this, in\r\nwhich the domes and needles of the Schandach, or ancient Scamus, are\r\ncovered with perpetual snow. Another table-land follows, whose marshy\r\nsurface is bounded by mural precipices at Mount Arbelus, near the town\r\nof Sophia. There the Hemus, or Balkan properly so called, begins, and\r\nruns in parallel ridges, separated by longitudinal valleys, to the Black\r\nSea, dividing the plains between the Lower Danube and the Propontis into\r\nnearly equal parts. The central ridge is passable in few places, and\r\nwhere there is no lateral ridge the precipices descend at once to the\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nThe Balkan is everywhere rent by terrific fissures across the chains and\r\ntable-lands, so deep and narrow that daylight is almost excluded. These\r\nchasms afford the safest passes across the range; the others along the\r\nfaces of the precipices are frightful.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean is the southern boundary of the elevated zone of\r\nEastern Europe, whose last offsets rise in rocky islands along the\r\ncoasts. The crystalline mountains of Sardinia and Corsica are outlying\r\nmembers of the Maritime Alps, while shorter offsets end in the plains of\r\nLombardy, forming the magnificent scenery of the Italian lakes. Even the\r\nApennines, whose elevation has given its form to the peninsula of Italy,\r\nare but secondary on a greater scale to the broad central band, as well\r\nas the mountains and high land in the north of Sicily, which form the\r\ncontinuance of the Calabrian chain.\r\n\r\nThe Apennines, beginning at the Maritime Alps, enclose the Gulf of\r\nGenoa, and run through the centre of Italy in parallel ranges to the\r\nmiddle of Calabria, where they split into two branches, one of which\r\ngoes to Capo de Leuca, on the Gulf of Torento, the other to Cape\r\nSpartivento, in the Straits of Messina. The whole length is about 800\r\nmiles. None of the Apennines come within the line of perpetual snow,\r\nthough it lies nine months in the year on the Gran Sasso d’ltalia, 9521\r\nfeet high, in Abruzza Ulteriore.\r\n\r\nOffsets from the Julian and Eastern Alps render Dalmatia and Albania\r\nperhaps the most rugged tract in Europe; and the Pindus, which forms the\r\nwatershed of Greece, diverges from the latter chain, and, running south\r\n200 miles, separates Albania from Macedonia and Thessaly.\r\n\r\nGreece is a country of mountains, and, although none are perpetually\r\ncovered with snow, it lies nine months on several of their summits. The\r\nchains terminate in strongly projecting headlands, which reach far into\r\nthe sea, and reappear in the numerous islands and rocks which stud that\r\ndeeply-indented coast. The Grecian mountains, like the Balkan, are torn\r\nby transverse fractures. The defile of Blatamana and the Gulf of\r\nSalonica are examples. The Adriatic, the Dardanelles, and the Sea of\r\nMarmora limit the secondaries of the southern part of the Balkan.\r\n\r\nThe valleys of the Alps are long and narrow; those among the mountains\r\nof Turkey in Europe and Greece are mostly caldron-shaped hollows, often\r\nenclosed by mural rocks. Many of these cavities of great size lie along\r\nthe foot of the Balkan. In the Morea they are so encompassed by\r\nmountains that the water has no escape but through the porous soil. They\r\nconsist of tertiary strata, which had formed the bottom of lakes.\r\nCaldron-shaped valleys occur also in most volcanic countries, as Sicily,\r\nItaly, and central France.\r\n\r\nThe table-lands which constitute the tops of mountains or of\r\nmountain-chains are of a different character from those terraces by\r\nwhich the high lands slope to the low. The former are on a small scale\r\nin Europe, and of a forbidding aspect, with the exception of the Jura,\r\nwhich is pastoral, whereas the latter are almost always habitable and\r\ncultivated. The mass of high land in south-eastern Europe shelves on the\r\nnorth to the great plain of Bavaria, 3000 feet high; Bohemia, which\r\nslopes from 1500 to 900 feet; and Hungary, from 4000 above the sea to\r\n300. The descent on the south of the Alps is six or seven times more\r\nrapid, because the distance from the axis of the chain is shorter.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to estimate the quantity of ice on the Alps; it\r\nis said, however, that, independent of the glaciers in the Grisons,\r\nthere are 1500 square miles of ice in the Alpine range, from 80 to 600\r\nfeet thick. There are no glaciers east of the Great Glockner, except on\r\nthe small group of Hallstadt. Thirty-four bound the snowy regions of\r\nMont Blanc, and 95 square miles of snow and ice clothe that mountain.\r\nSome glaciers have been permanent and stationary in the Alps time\r\nimmemorial, while others now occupy ground formerly bearing corn or\r\ncovered with trees, which the irresistible force of the ice has swept\r\naway. These ice-rivers, formed on the snow-clad summits of the\r\nmountains, fill the hollows and high valleys, hang on the declivities,\r\nor descend by their weight through the transverse valleys to the plains,\r\nwhere they are cut short by the increased temperature, and deposit those\r\naccumulations of rocks and rubbish, called moraines, which had fallen\r\nupon them from the heights above; but their motion is so slow, that six\r\ngenerations may pass before a stone fallen on the upper end of a long\r\nglacier can reach the moraine. In the Alps, the glaciers move at the\r\nrate of from 12 to 25 feet annually, and, as in rivers, the motion is\r\nmost rapid in the centre, and slower at the sides and bottom on account\r\nof friction. It is slower in winter, yet it does not cease, because the\r\nwinter’s cold penetrates the ice, as it does the ground, only to a\r\nlimited depth. Glaciers are not of solid ice; they consist of a mixture\r\nof ice, snow, and water; so that they are in some degree flexible and\r\nviscous, but acquire more solidity as they descend to lower levels;\r\nevaporation goes on at their surface, but they are not consumed by it.\r\nThe front is perpetually melting, but maintains a permanent form; it is\r\nsteep and inaccessible, owing to the figure of the ground over which it\r\ntumbles in its icy cascade, sometimes 1000 feet high. The middle course\r\nis rather level, the higher part very steep, and the surface is uneven\r\nand rent by crevices into which the purest blue streams fall in rushing\r\ncascades while the sun is up, but they freeze at his setting, and then a\r\ndeath-like silence prevails. The rocks and stones that fall on them from\r\nthe surrounding heights protect the ice below from the sun which melts\r\nit all around, so that at last they rest on elevated pinnacles till they\r\nfall off by their weight, and in this manner those numerous pyramids are\r\nformed with which the surface is bristled. Throughout much of the length\r\nof a glacier the winter’s snow melts from its surface as completely as\r\nit does from the ground; it is fed from above, for in the upper part the\r\nsnow never melts, but accumulates in a stratified form and is\r\nconsolidated. In some of the largest glaciers, where there is a\r\ndifference of 4000 feet in height between the origin and termination,\r\nthe pressure is enormous and irresistible, carrying all before it; even\r\nthe thickest forest is overwhelmed and crushed.\r\n\r\nGlaciers advance or retreat according to the severity or mildness of the\r\nseason; they have been advancing in Switzerland of late years, but they\r\nare subject to cycles of unknown duration. From the moraines, as well as\r\nthe striæ engraven on the rocks over which they have passed, M. Agassiz\r\nhas ascertained that the valley of Chamouni was at one time occupied by\r\na glacier that had moved towards the Col de Balme. A moraine 2000 feet\r\nabove the Rhone at St. Maurice would appear to indicate that, at a\r\nremote period, glaciers had covered Switzerland to the height of 2155\r\nfeet above the Lake of Geneva.\r\n\r\nTheir increase is now limited by various circumstances—as the mean\r\ntemperature of the earth, which is always above the freezing-point in\r\nthose latitudes; excessive evaporation; and blasts of hot air, which\r\noccur at all heights, in the night as well as in the day, from some\r\nunknown cause. They are not peculiar to the Alps, but have been observed\r\nalso in the glaciers of the Andes. From the heat of the valley thawing\r\nthe ice, the natural springs that rise under the glacier as they do\r\nelsewhere, the heat of the earth, the melting of the glacier itself, the\r\nrain that falls on its surface, which rushes down its crevices, a stream\r\nof turbid water is formed which works out an icy cavern at the\r\ntermination of the glacier and flows through it into the lower ground.\r\nThus, a glacier “begins in the clouds, is formed by the mountains, and\r\nends in the ocean.”[23]\r\n\r\nGranite no doubt forms the base of the mountain system of Eastern\r\nEurope, though it more rarely comes into view than might have been\r\nexpected. Crystalline schists of various kinds are enormously developed,\r\nand generally form the most elevated pinnacles of the Alpine crest and\r\nits offsets, and also the principal chains in Greece and Turkey in\r\nEurope; but the secondary fossiliferous strata constitute the chief\r\nmass, and often rise to the highest summits; indeed, secondary\r\nlimestones occupy a great portion of the high land of Eastern Europe.\r\nCalcareous rocks form two great mountain-zones on each side of the\r\ncentral chain of the Alps, and rise occasionally to altitudes of 10,000\r\nor 12,000 feet. They constitute a great portion of the central range of\r\nthe Apennines, and fill the greater part of Sicily. They are extensively\r\ndeveloped in Turkey in Europe, where the plateau of Bosnia with its high\r\nlands on the south, part of Macedonia, and Albania with its islands, are\r\nprincipally composed of them.[24] Tertiary strata of great thickness\r\nrest on the flanks of the Alps, and rise in some places to a height of\r\n5000 feet; zones of the older Pleiocene period flank the Apennines on\r\neach side, filled with organic remains; and half of Sicily is covered\r\nwith the Pleiocene strata. It appears that the Atlas, the Sierra Morena\r\nand most of the Spanish mountains, the central chain of the Caucasus,\r\nand the Balkan, were raised before the period of the erratic blocks.\r\n\r\nFrom numerous dislocations in the strata, the Alps appear to have been\r\nheaved up by many violent and repeated convulsions, separated by\r\nintervals of repose, and different parts of the chain have been raised\r\nat different times; for example, the Maritime Alps and the south-western\r\npart of the Jura mountains were raised previously to the formation of\r\nthe chalk: but the tertiary period appears to have been that of the\r\ngreatest commotions; for nearly two-thirds of the lands of Europe have\r\nrisen since the beginning of that epoch, and those that existed then\r\nacquired additional height, though some sank below their original level.\r\nDuring that time the Alps acquired an additional elevation of between\r\n2000 and 3000 feet; Mont Blanc then attained its present altitude; the\r\nApennines rose 1000 or 2000 feet higher; and the Carpathians seem to\r\nhave gained an accession of height since the seas were inhabited by the\r\nexisting species of animals.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe High Lands of the Great Continent (_continued_)—The Caucasus—The\r\n  Western Asiatic Table-Land and its Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmora form but a small break in the\r\nmighty girdle of the old continent, which again appears in immense\r\ntable-lands, passing through the centre of Asia, of such magnitude that\r\nthey occupy nearly two-fifths of the continent. Here everything is on a\r\nmuch grander scale than in Europe: the table-lands rise above the mean\r\nheight of the European mountains, and the mountains themselves that gird\r\nand traverse them surpass those of every other country in altitude. The\r\nmost barren deserts are here to be met with, as well as the most\r\nluxuriant productions of animal and vegetable life. The earliest records\r\nof the human race are found in this cradle of civilization, and\r\nmonuments still remain which show the skill and power of those nations\r\nwhich have passed away, but whose moral influence is still visible in\r\ntheir descendants. Customs, manners, and even prejudices, carry us back\r\nto times beyond the record of history, or even of tradition; while the\r\nmagnitude with which the natural world is here developed evinces the\r\ntremendous forces that must have been in action at epochs immeasurably\r\nanterior to the existence of man.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic mass of high land which extends for 6000 miles between the\r\nMediterranean and the Pacific is 2000 miles broad at its eastern\r\nextremity, 700 to 1000 in the middle, and somewhat less at its\r\ntermination. Colossal mountains and elevated terraces form the edges of\r\nthe lofty plains.\r\n\r\nBetween the 47th and 68th eastern meridians, where the low plains of\r\nHindostan and Bokara press upon the table-land and reduce its width to\r\n700 or 1000 miles, it is divided into two parts by an enormous knot of\r\nmountains formed by the meeting of the Hindoo Coosh, the Himalaya, the\r\nTsung-lin, and the transverse ranges of the Beloot Tagh, or Cloudy\r\nMountains: these two parts differ in height, form, and magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe western portion, which is the table-land of Persia or plateau of\r\nIran, is oblong, extending from the shores of Asia Minor to the Hindoo\r\nCoosh and the Solimaun range, which skirts the right bank of the Indus.\r\nIt occupies an area of 1,700,000 square miles, generally about 4000 feet\r\nabove the sea, and in some places 7000. The Oriental plateau or\r\ntable-land of Tibet, much the largest, has an area of 7,600,000 square\r\nmiles, a mean altitude of 14,000 feet, and in some parts of Tibet an\r\nabsolute altitude of 17,000 feet.\r\n\r\nAs the table-lands extend from S.W. to N.E., so also do the principal\r\nmountain-chains, as well those which bound the high lands as those which\r\ntraverse them. Remarkable exceptions to this equatorial direction of the\r\nAsiatic mass, however, occur in a series of meridional chains, whose\r\naxes extend from S.S.E. to N.N.W., between Cape Comoron, opposite to\r\nCeylon, and the Arctic Ocean, under the names of the Western Ghauts, the\r\nSolimaun range (which forms the eastern boundary of the table-land of\r\nPersia), the Beloot Tagh, or Bolor (which is the western limit of the\r\nOriental plateau), and the Ural Mountains. These chains, rich in gold,\r\nlie in different longitudes, and so alternate among themselves that each\r\nbegins only in that latitude which has not yet been attained by the\r\npreceding one. The Khinghan, in China, also extends from south to north\r\nalong the eastern slopes of the table-land, and forms its boundary at\r\nthat end.[26]\r\n\r\nThe lofty range of the Caucasus, which extends 700 miles between the\r\nBlack and Caspian Seas, is an outlying member of the Asiatic high lands.\r\nOffsets diverge like ribs from each side of the central crest, which\r\npenetrate the Russian Steppes on one hand, and on the other cross the\r\nplains of Kara, or valley of the Kour and Rioni, and unite the Caucasus\r\nto the table-land. Some parts of these mountains are very high; the\r\nElburz, on the western border of Georgia, is 17,796 feet. The central\r\npart of the chain is full of glaciers, and the limit of perpetual snow\r\nis at the altitude of 11,000 feet, which is higher than in any other\r\nchain of the old continent, except the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nAnatolia, the most western part of the table-land of Iran, 3000 feet\r\nabove the sea, is traversed by short chains and broken groups of\r\nmountains, separated by fertile valleys, which sink rapidly towards the\r\nArchipelago, and end in promontories and islands along the shores of\r\nAsia Minor, which is a country abounding in vast, luxuriant, but\r\nsolitary plains, watered by broad rivers—in Alpine platforms and\r\nmountain-ridges broken up by great valleys, opening seawards, with\r\nmeandering streams. Single mountains of volcanic formation are\r\nconspicuous objects on the table-land of Anatolia, which is rich in\r\npasture, though much of the soil is saline and covered with lakes and\r\nmarshes. A triple range of limestone mountains, 6000 or 7000 feet high,\r\ndivided by narrow but beautiful valleys, is the limit of the Anatolian\r\ntable-land along the shores of the Black Sea. Two-thirds of their height\r\nare covered with forests, and broken by wooded glens, leaving a narrow\r\ncoast, except near Trebizond, where it is broad and picturesque. The\r\nhigh land is bounded on the south by the serrated snowy range of the\r\nTaurus, which, beginning in Rhodes, Cos, and other islands in the\r\nMediterranean, fills the south-western parts of Asia Minor with\r\nramifications, and, after following the sinuosities of the iron-bound\r\ncoast of Karamania in a single lofty range, extends at Samisat, where\r\nthe Euphrates has pierced a way through this stony girdle.\r\n\r\nAbout the 50th meridian the table-land is compressed to nearly half its\r\nwidth, and there the lofty mountainous regions of Armenia, Kourdistan,\r\nand Azerbijan tower higher and higher between the Black Sea, the\r\nCaspian, and the Gulf of Scanderoon in the Mediterranean. Here the cold\r\ntreeless plains of Armenia, the earliest abode of man, 7000 feet above\r\nthe sea, bear no traces of the Garden of Eden; Mount Ararat, on which\r\nthe Ark is said to have rested, stands a solitary majestic volcanic\r\ncone, 17,260 feet above the sea, shrouded in perpetual snow. Though high\r\nand cold, the soil of Armenia is richer than that of Anatolia, and is\r\nbetter cultivated. It shelves on the north in luxuriant and beautiful\r\ndeclivities to the low and undulating valley of Kara, south of the\r\nCaucasus; and, on the other hand, the broad and lofty belt of the\r\nKourdistan mountains, rising abruptly in many parallel ranges from the\r\nplains of Mesopotamia, form its southern limit, and spread their\r\nramifications wide over its surface. They are rent by deep ravines, and\r\nin many places are so rugged that communication between the villages is\r\nalways difficult, and in winter impracticable from the depth of snow.\r\nThe line of perpetual congelation is decided and even along their\r\nsummit; their flanks are wooded, and the valleys populous and fertile.\r\n\r\nA thousand square miles of Kourdistan is occupied by the brackish lake\r\nVan, which is seldom frozen, though 5467 feet above the sea, and\r\nsurrounded by lofty mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Persian mountains, of which Elburz is the principal chain, extend\r\nalong the northern brink of the plateau, from Armenia, almost parallel\r\nto the shores of the Caspian Sea, maintaining a considerable elevation\r\nup to the volcanic peak of Demavend, near Tehrân, their culminating\r\npoint, which, though 90 miles inland, is a landmark to sailors on the\r\nCaspian. Elevated offsets of these mountains cover the volcanic\r\ntable-land of Azerbijan, the fire-country of Zoroaster, and one of the\r\nmost fertile provinces of Persia; there the Koh Salavan elevates its\r\nvolcanic cone. Beautiful plains, pure streams, and peaceful glades,\r\ninterspersed with villages, lie among the mountains, and the Vale of\r\nKhosran Shah, a picture of sylvan beauty, is celebrated as one of the\r\nfive paradises of Persian poetry. The vegetation at the foot of these\r\nmountains on the shores of the Caspian has all the exuberance of a\r\ntropical jungle. The Elburz loses its height to the east of Demavend,\r\nand then joins the mountains of Khorasan and the Paropamisan range,\r\nwhich appear to be chains of mountains when viewed from the low plains\r\nof Khorasan and Balkh, but on the table-land of Persia they merely form\r\na broad hilly country of rich soil, till they join the Hindoo Coosh.\r\n\r\nThe table-land of Iran is bounded, for 1,000 miles along the Persian\r\nGulf and Indian Ocean, by a mountainous belt of from three to seven\r\nparallel ranges, having an average width of 200 miles, and extending\r\nfrom the extremity of the Kourdistan Mountains to the mouth of the\r\nIndus. The Lasistán Mountains, which form the northern part of this\r\nbelt, and bound the vast level plain of the Tigris, rise from it in a\r\nsuccession of high table-lands divided by very rugged mountains, the\r\nlast ridge of which, mostly covered with snow, abuts on the table-land\r\nof Persia. Oaks clothe their flanks; the valleys are of generous soil,\r\nverdant, and cultivated; and many rivers flow through them to swell the\r\nstream of the Tigris. Insulated hill forts, from 2000 to 5000 feet high,\r\noccur in this country, with flat cultivated tops some miles in extent,\r\naccessible only by ladders, or holes cut in their precipitous sides.\r\nThese countries are full of ancient inscriptions and remains of\r\nantiquity. The moisture decreases more and more south from Shiraz, and\r\nthen the parallel ridges, repulsive in aspect and difficult to pass, are\r\nseparated by arid longitudinal valleys, which ascend like steps from the\r\nnarrow shores of the Persian Gulf to the table-land. The coasts of the\r\ngulf are burning hot sand solitudes, so completely barren, that the\r\ncountry from Bassora to the Indus, a distance of 1200 miles, is nearly a\r\nsterile waste. In the few favoured spots on the terraces where water\r\noccurs there is vegetation, and the beauty of these valleys is enhanced\r\nby surrounding sterility.[27]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Mazenderan and the other provinces bordering upon\r\nthe Caspian, and in the Paropamisan range, Persia is arid, possessing\r\nfew perennial springs, and not one great river; in fact, three-tenths of\r\nthe country is a desert, and the table-land is nearly a wide scene of\r\ndesolation. A great salt-desert occupies 27,000 square miles between\r\nIrak and Khorasan, of which the soil is a stiff clay, covered with\r\nefflorescence of common salt and nitre, often an inch thick, varied only\r\nby a few saline plants and patches of verdure in the hollows. This\r\ndreary waste joins the large sandy and equally dreary desert of Kerman.\r\nKelat, the capital of Belochistan, is 7000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea: round it there is cultivation, but the greater part of that country\r\nis a lifeless plain, over which the brick-red sand is drifted by the\r\nnorth wind into ridges like the waves of the sea, often 12 feet high,\r\nwithout a vestige of vegetation. The blast of the desert, whose hot and\r\npestilential breath is fatal to man and animals, renders these dismal\r\nsands impassable at certain seasons.\r\n\r\nBarren lands or bleak downs prevail at the foot of the Lukee and\r\nSolimaun ranges, formed of bare porphyry and sandstone, which skirt the\r\neastern edge of the table-land, and dip to the plains of the Indus. In\r\nAfghanistan there is little cultivation except on the banks of the\r\nstreams that flow into the Lake Zerrah, but vitality returns towards the\r\nnorth-east. The plains and valleys among the offsets from the Hindoo\r\nCoosh are of surpassing loveliness, and combine the richest peaceful\r\nbeauty with the majesty of the snow-capped mountains by which they are\r\nencircled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nThe High Lands of the Great Continent (_continued_)—The Oriental\r\n  Table-Land and its Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Oriental plateau, or table-land of Tibet, is an irregular four-sided\r\nmass stretching from S.W. to N.E., enclosed and traversed by the highest\r\nmountains in the world. It is separated from the table-land of Persia by\r\nthe Hindoo Coosh, which may be considered as the western prolongation of\r\nthe Himalaya, occupying the terrestrial isthmus between the low lands of\r\nHindostan and Bucharia.\r\n\r\nThe cold dreary plateau of Tibet is separated on the south from the\r\nglowing luxuriant plains of Hindostan by the Himalaya, which extends\r\nfrom the eastern extremity of the Hindoo Coosh in Cabulistan to about\r\nthe 95th meridian, where it joins the immense mountain-knot which\r\nrenders the south-western corner of the table-land and the Chinese\r\nprovince of Yun-nan one of the most elevated regions on the earth. On\r\nthe west, the table-land has its limits in the chain of the Bolor or\r\nBeloot Tagh, the “Cloudy Mountains,” the Tartash Tagh of the natives, a\r\ntransverse range which detaches itself from the Hindoo Coosh nearly at a\r\nright angle about the 72d degree of E. longitude, and, pursuing a\r\nnortherly direction, forms magnificent mountain-knots with the diagonal\r\nchains of the table-land, and is the watershed between the valley of the\r\nOxus and Chinese Tartary. It descends in a succession of tiers or\r\nterraces through the countries of Bokhara and Balkh to the deep cavity\r\nin which the Caspian Sea and the Sea of Azoff lie, and forms, with the\r\nWestern Ghauts, the Solimaun range, and the Ural, a singular exception\r\nto the general parallelism of the Asiatic mountains. Two narrow\r\ndifficult passes lead over the Beloot Tagh from the low plains of\r\nBucharia and Independent Tourkistan to Kashgar and Yarkand, on the\r\ntable-land in Chinese Tartary. The north-eastern edge of the table-land\r\nis bounded by the Khing-han Mountains, a serrated granitic chain running\r\nfrom south to north, which separates the plateau of Mongolia from the\r\ncountry of Mantchouria, and joins the Yablonoi branch of the Altaï at\r\nright angles about the 55th degree of north latitude. Little more is\r\nknown of the south-eastern boundary of the table-land than that it is a\r\nmass of exceedingly high mountains. In fact, between the sources of the\r\nBrahmapootra and the Altaï chain, nearly 1,000,000 of square miles of\r\nthe Chinese empire is covered with mountains.\r\n\r\nThe table-land itself is crossed longitudinally from west to east by two\r\ngreat chains. The Kuenlun, or Chinese range, begins about 35° 30ʹ N.\r\nlat. at the mountain-knot of Tsung-lin, formed by the Hindoo Coosh and\r\nHimalaya, and, running eastward, it terminates about the 110th meridian,\r\nbut probably covers a great part of the western provinces of China with\r\nits branches. The Thian-shan, or “Celestial Mountains,” lie more to the\r\nnorth; they begin at the Bolor or Beloot Tagh, and, running along the\r\n42d parallel, sink to the desert of the Great Gobi about the centre of\r\nthe plateau, but, rising again, they are continued under the name of\r\nShan-Garjan, which runs to the north-east and ends on the shores of the\r\nJapan Sea. The Thian-shan is exceedingly volcanic, and, though so far\r\ninland, pours forth lava, and exhibits all the other phenomena of\r\nvolcanic districts.\r\n\r\nTibet is enclosed between the Himalaya and the Kuen-lun; Tungut, or\r\nChinese Tartary, lies between the latter chain and the Thian-shan, or\r\nCelestial Mountains; and Zungary, or Mongolia, between the Celestial\r\nrange and the Altaï. The meridional chain of the Bolor encloses Chinese\r\nTartary on the west; and Mongolia, which is entirely open on the west,\r\nis shut in on the east by the Khing-han range, also running from south\r\nto north. The Himalaya and Altaï ranges diverge in their easterly\r\ncourses, so that the table-land, which is only from 700 to 1000 miles\r\nwide at its western extremity, is 2000 between the Chinese province of\r\nYunnan and the country of the Mantchou Tonguses.[28]\r\n\r\nOf all these vast chains of mountains the Himalaya, and its principal\r\nbranch the Hindoo Coosh, are best known; though even of these a great\r\npart has never been explored, on account of their enormous height and\r\nthe depth of snow, which make it impossible to approach the central\r\nridge, except in a very few places.\r\n\r\nThe range consists of three parts: the Hindoo Coosh, or Indian Caucasus,\r\nwhich extends from the Paropamisan range in Afghanistan to Cashmere; the\r\nHimalaya, or Imaus of the ancients, which stretches from the valley of\r\nCashmere to Bhotan; and, lastly, the mountains of Bhotan and Assam—the\r\nthree making one magnificent unbroken chain.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoo Coosh, which has its name from a mountain of great height,\r\nnorth of the city of Cabul, is very broad to the west, extending over\r\nmany degrees of latitude, and, together with the offsets of the Beloot\r\nTagh, fills the countries of Kafferistan, Koonduz, and Budakshan. From\r\nthe plains to the south it seems to consist of four distinct ranges\r\nrunning one above another, the last of which abuts on the table-land,\r\nand is so high that its snowy summits are visible at the distance of 150\r\nmiles. A ridge of stupendous height encloses the beautiful valley of\r\nCashmere, to the east of which the chain takes the name of Himalaya,\r\n“the dwelling of snow.” From the great mountain-knot of Tsung-lin, the\r\nHimalaya no longer maintains its direct easterly course, but makes a\r\nvast arch to the south of 300 miles, which extends to the Brahmapootra,\r\nvarying in breadth from 250 to 350 miles, and occupying an area of\r\n600,000 square miles.[29]\r\n\r\nThe general structure of the Himalaya is very regular: the first range\r\nof hills that rise above the plains of Hindostan is alluvial, north of\r\nwhich lies the Tariyani, a tract from 10 to 30 miles wide, 1000 feet\r\nabove the sea, covered with dense pestilential jungle, and extending\r\nalong the foot of the range. North of this region are rocky ridges 5000\r\nor 6000 feet high. Between these and the higher ranges lie the peaceful\r\nand well-cultivated valleys of Nepaul, Bhotan, and Assam, of\r\ninexhaustible fertility, interspersed with picturesque and populous\r\ntowns and villages. Though separated by mountain-groups, they form the\r\nprincipal terrace of the Himalaya between the Sutlej and Brahmapootra.\r\nBehind these are mountains from 10,000 to 12,000 feet high, flanked by\r\nmagnificent forests; and, lastly, the snowy ranges rise in succession to\r\nthe table-land.\r\n\r\nThe principal and most elevated chains are cut by narrow, gloomy ravines\r\nand transverse dusky gorges, through which the torrents of melted snow\r\nrush to swell the rivers of Hindostan. The character of the valleys\r\nbecomes softer in the lower regions, till at last the luxuriance of\r\nvegetation and beauty cannot be surpassed. Transverse valleys, however,\r\nare more frequent in the Hindoo Coosh than in the Himalaya, where they\r\nconsist chiefly of such chasms filled with wreck as the tributaries of\r\nthe Indus and Ganges have made in bursting through the chain.\r\n\r\nThe mean height of the Himalaya is stupendous. Captain Gerard and his\r\nbrother estimated that it could not be less than from 16,000 to 20,000\r\nfeet; but, from the average elevation of the passes over these\r\nmountains, Baron Humboldt thinks it must be under 15,700 feet. Colonel\r\nSabine estimates it to be only 11,510 feet, though the peaks exceeding\r\nthat elevation are not to be numbered, especially at the sources of the\r\nSutlej; indeed, from that river to the Kalee, the chain exhibits an\r\nendless succession of the loftiest mountains on earth; forty of them\r\nsurpass the height of Chimborazo, one of the highest of the Andes, and\r\nseveral reach the height of 25,000 feet at least. So rugged is this part\r\nof the magnificent chain, that the military parade at Sabathoo, half a\r\nmile long and a quarter of a mile broad, is said to be the only level\r\nground between it and the Tartar frontier on the north, or the valley of\r\nNepaul on the east. Towards the fruitful valleys of Nepaul and Bhotan\r\nthe Himalaya is equally lofty, some of the mountains being 28,000 feet\r\nhigh; but it is narrower, and the descent to the plains excessively\r\nrapid, especially in the territory of Bhotan, where the dip from the\r\ntable-land is more than 10,000 feet in ten miles. The valleys are\r\ncrevices so deep and narrow, and the mountains that hang over them in\r\nmenacing cliffs are so lofty, that these abysses are shrouded in\r\nperpetual gloom, except where the rays of a vertical sun penetrate their\r\ndepths. From the steepness of the descent the rivers shoot down with the\r\nswiftness of an arrow, filling the caverns with foam and the air with\r\nmist. At the very base of this wild region lies the elevated and\r\npeaceful valley of Bhotan, vividly green, and shaded by magnificent\r\nforests. Another rapid descent of 1000 feet leads to the plain of the\r\nGanges.\r\n\r\nThe Himalaya still maintains great height along the north of Assam, and\r\nat the Brahmapootra the parent stem and its branches extend in breadth\r\nover two degrees of latitude, forming a vast mountain-knot of great\r\nelevation. Beyond this point nothing certain is known of the range, but\r\nit or some of its branches are supposed to cross the southern provinces\r\nof the Chinese empire, and to end in the volcanic island of Formosa.\r\nLittle more is known of the northern side of the mountains than that the\r\npasses are about 5000 feet above the plains of Tibet.\r\n\r\nThe passes over the Hindoo Coosh, though not the highest, are very\r\nformidable: there are six from Cabul to the plains of Turkistan; and so\r\ndeep and so much enclosed are the defiles, that Sir Alexander Burnes\r\nnever could obtain an observation of the pole-star in the whole journey\r\nfrom Barmeean till within thirty miles of Turkistan.\r\n\r\nMost of the passes over the Himalaya are but little lower than the top\r\nof Mont Blanc: many are higher, especially near the Sutlej, where they\r\nare from 18,000 to 19,000 feet high; and that north-east of Khoonawur is\r\n20,000 feet above the level of the sea—the highest that has been\r\nattempted. All are terrific, and the fatigue and suffering from the\r\nrarity of the air in the last 500 feet is not to be described. Animals\r\nare as much distressed as human beings, and many die; thousands of birds\r\nperish from the violence of the wind, the drifting snow is often fatal\r\nto travellers, and violent thunderstorms add to the horror of the\r\njourney. The Niti Pass, by which Mr. Moorcroft ascended to the sacred\r\nlake of Manasa, in Tibet, is tremendous; he and his guide had not only\r\nto walk barefooted, from the risk of slipping, but they were obliged to\r\ncreep along the most frightful chasms, holding by twigs and tufts of\r\ngrass, and sometimes they crossed deep and awful crevices on a branch of\r\na tree, or on loose stones thrown across. Yet these are the\r\nthoroughfares for commerce in the Himalaya, never repaired nor\r\nsusceptible of improvement from frequent landslips and torrents.\r\n\r\nThe loftiest peaks being bare of snow gives great variety of colour and\r\nbeauty to the scenery, which in these passes is at all times\r\nmagnificent. During the day, the stupendous size of the mountains, their\r\ninterminable extent, the variety and sharpness of their forms, and,\r\nabove all, the tender clearness of their distant outline melting into\r\nthe pale blue sky, contrasted with the deep azure above, is described as\r\na scene of wild and wonderful beauty. At midnight, when myriads of stars\r\nsparkle in the black sky, and the pure blue of the mountains looks\r\ndeeper still below the pale white gleam of the earth and snow-light, the\r\neffect is of unparalleled solemnity, and no language can describe the\r\nsplendour of the sunbeams at daybreak streaming between the high peaks,\r\nand throwing their gigantic shadows on the mountains below. There, far\r\nabove the habitation of man, no living thing exists, no sound is heard;\r\nthe very echo of the traveller’s footsteps startles him in the awful\r\nsolitude and silence that reigns in these august dwellings of\r\neverlasting snow.\r\n\r\nNature has in mercy mitigated the intense rigour of the cold in these\r\nhigh lands in a degree unexampled in other mountainous regions. The\r\nclimate is mild, the valleys are verdant and inhabited, corn and fruit\r\nripen at elevations which in other countries—even under the equator—\r\nwould be buried in permanent snow.\r\n\r\nIt is also a peculiarity in these mountains that the higher the range\r\nthe higher likewise is the limit of snow and vegetation. On the southern\r\nslopes of the first range, Mr. Gerard found cultivation 10,000 feet\r\nabove the sea, though it was often necessary to reap the corn still\r\ngreen and unripe; while in Chinese Tartary good crops are raised 16,000\r\nfeet above the sea. Captain Gerard saw pasture and low bushes up to\r\n17,009 feet; and corn as high as even 18,544 feet, which is 2784 feet\r\nhigher than the top of Mont Blanc, and 1279 feet above the snow-line in\r\nthe province of Quito under the equator. Birch-trees with tall stems\r\ngrow at the elevation of 14,068 feet, and the vine and other fruits\r\nthrive in the valleys of these high plains. The temperature of the earth\r\nprobably has some influence on the vegetation: as many hot springs exist\r\nin the Himalaya at great heights, there must be a source of heat below\r\nthese mountains, which in some places comes near the surface, and\r\npossibly may be connected with the volcanic fires in the central chains\r\nof the table-land. Hot springs abound in the valley of Jumnotra; and as\r\nit is well known that many plants thrive in very cold air if their roots\r\nare well protected, it may be the cause of pine-trees thriving at great\r\nelevations in that valley, and of the splendid forests of the deodar, a\r\nspecies of cypress that grows to gigantic size even in the snow.\r\n\r\nAccording to Captain and Mr. Gerard, the line of perpetual congelation\r\nis at an elevation of only 12,981 feet on the southern slopes of the\r\nHimalaya; while on the northern side, or rather on the peaks which rise\r\nabove the table-land, the limit is 16,620 feet; but the mean height of\r\nthe table-land of Tibet, and the relative elevation of the line of\r\nperpetual snow on the two declivities of the Himalaya, require to be\r\nbetter investigated. The greater elevation of the snow-line on the\r\nnorthern side is the joint result of the serenity of the sky, the less\r\nfrequent formation of snow in very cold dry air, and the radiation of\r\nheat from the neighbouring plains, which, being so near, have much\r\ngreater effect on the temperature than the warmer but more distant\r\nplains on the south. There are fewer glaciers in the Asiatic mountains\r\nthan might have been expected from the great mass of snow; they are\r\nchiefly on the Thibetian side of the Himalaya, and on the Kuenlun. There\r\nis a very large one at the source of the Indus, and another at the\r\nsource of the Ganges, on the southern face of the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nVarious secondary chains of great length detach themselves from the\r\neastern extremity of the Himalaya, or rather the vast knot of mountains,\r\nnear the sources of the Brahmapootra, in the Chinese province of\r\nYun-nan, which is a terra incognita; their origin, therefore, is\r\nunknown. But in Upper Assam they run cross to the equatorial system of\r\nAsiatic mountains, and, extending in a southerly but diverging\r\ndirection, they spread like the spokes of a fan through the countries\r\neast of the Ganges and the Indo-Chinese peninsula, leaving large and\r\nfertile kingdoms between them. The Birmano-Siamese chain is the most\r\nextensive, reaching to Cape Romania, at the southern extremity of the\r\nMalay peninsula, the most southerly point of the Asiatic continent; it\r\nmay be traced through the island of Sumatra parallel to the coast, and\r\nalso in the islands of Banca and Biliton, where it ends.\r\n\r\nAnother range, called the Laos-Siamese chain, forms the eastern boundary\r\nof the kingdom of Siam, and the Annamatic chain, from the same origin,\r\nseparates the empire of Annam from Tonquin and Cochin China.\r\n\r\nThese slightly diverging lines of mountains yield gold, silver, tin of\r\nthe best quality and in great plenty, almost on the surface, and\r\nprecious stones, as rubies and sapphires. Mountains in low latitudes\r\nhave nothing of the severe character of those in less favoured climes.\r\nMagnificent forests reach their summit; spices, dyes of brilliant tints,\r\nmedicinal and odoriferous plants, clothe their declivities; and in the\r\nlow grounds the fruits of India and China grow in perfection, in a soil\r\nwhich yields three crops of grain in the year.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the Himalaya is of stratified crystalline rocks, especially\r\ngneiss, with large granitic veins, and beds of quartz of huge magnitude.\r\nThe zone between 15,000 and 18,000 feet above the level of the sea is of\r\nSilurian strata; granite is most frequent at the base, and probably\r\nforms the foundation of the chain. Strata of comparatively modern date\r\noccur at great elevations. The sedimentary formations, prevailing also\r\non the acclivities of the Alps and Apennines, show that the epochs of\r\nelevation in parts of the earth widely remote from one another, if not\r\nsimultaneous, were at least not very different. There can be no doubt\r\nthat very great geological changes have taken place at a comparatively\r\nrecent period in the Himalaya, and through an extensive part of the\r\nAsiatic continent.\r\n\r\nThe Altaï mountains, which form the northern margin of the table-land,\r\nare unconnected with the Ural chain: they are separated from it by 400\r\nmiles of a low marshy country, part of the steppe of the Kirghiz, and by\r\nthe Dalaï mountains, a low range never above 2000 feet high, which runs\r\nbetween the 64th meridian and the left bank of the Irtish. The Altaï\r\nchain rises on the right bank of that river, at the north-west angle of\r\nthe table-land, and extends in a serpentine line to the Pacific, south\r\nof the Gulf of Okhotzk, dividing the high lands of Tartary and China\r\nfrom the wastes of Asiatic Siberia. Under various names, its branches\r\nskirt the north-west side of the Gulf of Okhotzk, and thence stretching\r\nto Behring’s Straits, it ends at Eastern Cape, the most eastern\r\nextremity of the old continent, the whole length of the chain being 4500\r\nmiles. The breadth of this chain varies from 400 to 1000 miles, but\r\ntowards the 105th meridian it is contracted to about 150 by a projection\r\nof the desert of the Great Gobi. Its height bears no proportion to its\r\nlength and breadth. The Altaï, the only part of the chain properly so\r\ncalled, can only be regarded as a succession of terraces of a swelling\r\noutline, descending by steps from the table-land, and ending in the\r\npromontories of the Siberian plains. There are numerous large lakes on\r\nthese terraces and in the valleys, as in the mountain systems of Europe.\r\nThe general form of this part of the chain is monotonous from the\r\nprevalence of straight lines and smooth rounded outlines—long ridges\r\nwith flattened summits, or small table-lands not more than 6000 feet\r\nhigh, which rarely attain the line of perpetual congelation: snow,\r\nhowever, is permanent on the Korgon table-land, 9900 feet above the sea,\r\nsupposed to be the culminating point of this part of the chain. These\r\ntable-lands bear a strong resemblance to those in the Scandinavian\r\nmountains in baldness and sterility, but their flanks are clothed with\r\nforests, verdant meadows, and pastoral valleys.\r\n\r\nEast of the 86th meridian this region of low mountains splits into three\r\nbranches, enclosing longitudinal valleys for 450 miles. The Sayansk and\r\nZongnou mountains, which are the northern and central branches, form a\r\nmountain-knot nearly as large as England, which projects like a huge\r\npromontory on the Siberian plains[30] west of Lake Baikal, and is\r\ncelebrated for the richness of its mines. The third branch, which is the\r\nUlangomula, lies south of Lake Oubsa. The principal part of the Baikal\r\ngroup is 500 miles long, from 10 to 60 wide, high and snow-capped, and\r\nsaid to be without glaciers. It flanks lake Baikal on the north, the\r\nlargest of Alpine lakes, so embedded in a knot of mountains, partly\r\ngranitic, partly volcanic, that rocks and pillars of granite rise from\r\nits bed. The mountains south of the lake are but the face of the\r\ntable-land; a traveller ascending them finds himself at once in the\r\ndesert of Gobi, which stretches in unbroken sadness to the great wall of\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nThe Daouria mountains, a volcanic portion of the Altaï, which borders\r\nthe table-land on the north-east, follow the Baikal chain; and farther\r\neast, at the sources of the Aldan, the Altaï range takes the name of the\r\nYablonnoi Khrebet, and stretches south of the Gulf of Okhotzk to the\r\ncoast of the Pacific opposite to the island of Saghalian; while another\r\npart, 1000 miles broad, fills the space between the Gulf of Okhotzk and\r\nthe river Lena, and then, bending to the north-east, ends in the\r\npeninsula of Kamtchatka. Between the western end of Lake Baikal and the\r\nYablonnoi Khrebet the mountain-chains are parallel, and extend from the\r\nW.S.W. to the E.N.E., which is the general direction of the high lands\r\nin the most easterly regions of Asia.\r\n\r\nA great part of the Altaï chain is unknown to Europeans; the innumerable\r\nbranches that penetrate the Chinese empire are completely so: those\r\nbelonging to Russia abound in a great variety of precious and rare\r\nmetals and minerals—silver, copper, and iron. In the Yablonnoi range,\r\nand other parts, there are whole mountains of porphyry, with red and\r\ngreen jasper; coal is also found; and in a branch of the Altaï between\r\nthe rivers Obi and Yennissei there are mines of coal which, having been\r\nset on fire by lightning, have continued to burn for more than a\r\ncentury. The Siberian mountains far surpass the Andes in the richness of\r\ntheir gold mines. The eastern flank of the Ural chain, and some of the\r\nnorthern spurs of the Altaï, have furnished a vast quantity of gold, but\r\na region as large as France has lately been discovered in Siberia\r\ncovered with the richest gold alluvium, lying above rocks abounding in\r\nthat precious metal. The mines of the Ural and Altaï are situated\r\nprincipally in metamorphic rocks, adjacent to the greenstones, syenites,\r\nand serpentines that have caused their change; and as the same formation\r\nprevails throughout the greater part of the Altaï and Aldan chains\r\nalmost to Kamtchatka, there is every reason to believe that the whole of\r\nthat vast region is auriferous: besides, as many of the northern offsets\r\nof the Altaï are particularly rich, it may be concluded that the\r\nsouthern branches in the Chinese empire are equally so. Thus, Southern\r\nSiberia and Chinese Tartary form an auriferous district, probably\r\ngreater in area than all Europe, which extends even to our dominions in\r\nHindostan, where the formations containing gold are unexplored.[31]\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary deposits in this extensive mountain-range are more\r\nancient than the granite, syenite, and porphyries: consequently these\r\nigneous rocks have not here formed part of the original crust of the\r\nglobe. Rocks of the Palæozoic series occupy the greater part of the\r\nAltaï, and probably there are none more modern. There are no volcanic\r\nrocks, properly speaking, ancient or modern, west of the Yenissei, but\r\nthey abound to the east of that river, even to Kamtchatka, which is full\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe physical characters and the fossil remains of this extensive\r\nmountain system have little relation with the geological formations of\r\nEurope and America. Eastern Siberia seems even to form an insulated\r\ndistrict by itself, and that part between the town of Yakoutzk and the\r\nmouth of the Lena appears to have been raised at a later period than the\r\npart of Siberia stretching westward to the Sayansk mountains; moreover,\r\nthe elevation of the western part of the Altaï was probably\r\ncontemporaneous with that of the Ural mountains.[32] On the whole, the\r\nchains in the direction of parallels of latitude in the Old Continent\r\nare much more numerous and extensive than those in the meridians; and as\r\nthey lie chiefly towards the equator, the internal forces that raised\r\nthem were probably modified by the rotation of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe table-land of Tibet is only 4000 feet above the sea towards the\r\nnorth, but it rises in Little Tibet to between 11,000 and 12,000 feet.\r\nThe Kuen-lun, the most southerly of the two diagonal mountain-chains\r\nthat cross the table-land, begins at the Hindoo Coosh, in latitude 35°\r\n30ʹ, being, in fact, a branch of that chain, and extends eastward in two\r\nbranches, which surround the lake Tengri-Nor, and again unite in the\r\nK’han of eastern Tibet. The most southerly of the two branches, known as\r\nthe Ice Mountains, or Kara-Korum of the natives, maintains a curved\r\ncourse parallel to the Himalaya, and then bends north towards the\r\nKuen-lun, which pursues a more direct line across the table-land. Chains\r\nmore or less connected with these form an elevated mountain plain round\r\nLake Koko-Nor, nearly in the centre of the table-land, from whence those\r\nimmense mountain-ranges diverge, which render the south-western\r\nprovinces of China the most elevated region on earth. The country of\r\nTibet lying between the Himalaya and the Kuen-lun consists of rocky\r\nmountainous ridges, extending from N.W. to S.E., separated by long\r\nvalleys, in which flow the upper courses of the Brahmapootra, Sutlej,\r\nand Indus. According to Mr. Moorcroft, the sacred lake Manasa, in Great\r\nTibet, and the surrounding country, is 17,000 feet above the sea, which\r\nis 1240 feet higher than Mont Blanc. In this elevated region wheat and\r\nbarley grow, and many of the fruits of Southern Europe ripen. The city\r\nof H’Lassa, in eastern Tibet, the residence of the Grand Lama, is\r\nsurrounded by vineyards, and is called by the Chinese the “Realm of\r\nPleasure.” There are some trees in this country; but the ground in\r\ncultivation bears a small proportion to the grassy steppes, which extend\r\nin endless monotony, grazed by thousands of the shawl-wool goats, sheep,\r\nand cattle. There are many lakes in the table-land: some in Ladak\r\ncontain borax—a salt very useful in the arts, found only here, at Monte\r\nCerboliti in Tuscany, and in one of the Lipari islands.\r\n\r\nIn summer the sun is powerful at mid-day, the air is of the purest\r\ntransparency, and the azure of the sky so deep that it seems black as in\r\nthe darkest night. The rising moon does not enlighten the atmosphere, no\r\nwarning radiance announces her approach, till her limb touches the\r\nhorizon, and the stars shine with the distinctness and brilliancy of\r\nsuns. In southern Tibet the verdure is confined to favoured spots; the\r\nbleak mountains and high plains are sternly gloomy—a scene of barrenness\r\nnot to be conceived. Solitude reigns in these dreary wastes, where there\r\nis not a tree, nor even a shrub to be seen of more than a few inches\r\nhigh. The scanty, short-lived verdure vanishes in October; the country\r\nthen looks as if fire had passed over it, and cutting dry winds blow\r\nwith irresistible fury, howling in the bare mountains, whirling the snow\r\nthrough the air, and freezing to death the unfortunate traveller\r\nbenighted in their defiles.\r\n\r\nYarkand and Khotan, provinces of Chinese Tartary, which lie beyond the\r\ntwo diagonal chains, are less elevated and more fertile than Tibet; yet\r\nit is so cold in winter that the river Yarkiang is frozen for three\r\nmonths. They are watered by five rivers, and contain several large\r\ncities; Yarkand, the most considerable of these, is the emporium of\r\ncommerce between Tibet, Turkistan, China, and Russia. Gold, rubies,\r\nsilk, and other productions are exported.\r\n\r\nThe Tartar range of the Thian-Shan is very high; the Bogda Oola, or\r\n“Holy Mountain,” near Lake Lob, its highest point, is always covered\r\nwith snow, and it has two active volcanoes, one on each side. This range\r\nruns along the 42d parallel of north latitude, forming at its western\r\nextremity a mountain-knot with the Beloot Tagh, in the centre of which\r\nlies the small table-land of Pamer, 15,600 feet high, called by the\r\nnatives the “Roof of the World.” Its remarkable elevation was first\r\ndescribed by the celebrated Venetian traveller Marco Polo, six centuries\r\nago. The Oxus originates in a glacier of the Pooshtee Khur, a peak of\r\nthe Beloot Tagh near the plain of Pamer; the lake Sir-i-Kol is here the\r\nsource of the river of Yarkand; and the Kokan also rises in the same\r\nplain, which is intensely cold in winter, and in summer is alive with\r\nflocks of sheep and goats. Snow lies deep on the Thian-Shan range in\r\nwinter, yet little falls on the plains on account of the dryness of the\r\nair. There are only two or three showers annually on these mountains,\r\nfor a very short time, and the drops are so minute as scarcely to wet\r\nthe ground, yet the streams from them suffice for irrigation.\r\n\r\nZungary, or Mongolia, the country between the Thian-Shan and the Altaï,\r\nis hardly known, further than that its grassy steppes, intersected by\r\nmany lakes and offsets from the Altaï, are the pasture-grounds of the\r\nwandering Kirghiz.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable feature of the table-land is the desert of the Great\r\nGobi, which occupies an area of 300,000 square miles in its eastern\r\nextremity, interrupted only by a few spots of pasture and low bushes.\r\nWide tracts are flat, and covered with small stones or sand, and widely\r\nseparated from one another are low hills destitute of wood and water;\r\nits general elevation is 4220 feet above the sea, but it is intersected\r\nfrom west to east by a depressed valley aptly named Shamo, or the “Sea\r\nof Sand,” which is also mixed with salt. West from it lies the Han-Hai,\r\nthe “Dry Sea,” a barren plain of shifting sand blown into high ridges.\r\nHere, as in all deserts, the summer sun is scorching, no rain falls, and\r\nwhen thick fog occurs it is only the precursor of fierce winds. All the\r\nplains of Mongolia are intensely cold in winter, because the hills to\r\nthe north are too low to screen them from the polar blast, and, being\r\nhigher than the Siberian deserts, they are bitterly cold; no month in\r\nthe year is free from frost and snow, yet it is not deep enough to\r\nprevent cattle from finding pasture. Sandy deserts like that of the\r\nGreat Gobi occupy much of the country south of the Chinese branches of\r\nthe Altaï.\r\n\r\nSuch is the stupendous zone of high land that girds the old continent\r\nthroughout its whole length. In the extensive plains on each side of it\r\nseveral independent mountain systems rise, though much inferior to it in\r\nextent and height.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSecondary Mountain Systems of the Great Continent—That of Scandinavia—\r\n  Great Britain and Ireland—The Ural Mountains—The Great Northern Plain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE great northern plain is broken by two masses of high land, in every\r\nrespect inferior to those described; they are the Scandinavian system\r\nand the Ural mountains, the arbitrary limit between Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nThe range of primary mountains which has given its form to the\r\nScandinavian peninsula begins at Cape Lindesnaes, the most southerly\r\npoint of Norway, and, after running along its western coast 1000 miles\r\nin a north-easterly direction, ends at Cape Nord Kyn, on the Polar\r\nOcean, the extremity of Europe. The highest elevation of this chain is\r\nnot more than 8412 feet. It has been compared to a great wave or billow,\r\nrising gradually from the east, which, after having formed a crest,\r\nfalls perpendicularly into the sea in the west. There are 3696 square\r\nmiles of this peninsula above the line of perpetual snow.\r\n\r\nThe southern portion of the chain consists of ridges following the\r\ngeneral direction of the range, 150 miles broad. At the distance of 360\r\nmiles from Cape Lindesnaes, the mountains form a single elevated mass,\r\nterminated by a table-land which maintains an altitude of 4500 feet for\r\n100 miles. It slopes towards the east, and plunges at once in high\r\nprecipices into a deep sea on the west.\r\n\r\nThe surface is barren, marshy, and bristled with peaks; besides an area\r\nof 600 square leagues is occupied by the Snae Braen, the greatest mass\r\nof perpetual snow and glaciers on the continent of Europe. A prominent\r\ncluster of mountains follows, from whence a single chain, 25 miles\r\nbroad, maintains an uninterrupted line to the island of Megaree, where\r\nit terminates its visible career in North Cape, a huge barren rock\r\nperpetually lashed by the surge of the Polar Ocean, but from the\r\ncorrespondence in geological structure it must be continued under the\r\nsea to where it reappears, according to M. Boué, in the schistose rocks\r\nof Spitzbergen. Offsets from these mountains cover Finland and the low\r\nrocky table-land of Lapland: the valleys and countries along the eastern\r\nside of the chain abound in forests and Alpine lakes.\r\n\r\nThe iron-bound coast of Norway is a continued series of rocky islands,\r\ncapes, promontories, and precipitous cliffs, rent into chasms which\r\npenetrate miles into the heart of the mountains. These chasms, or\r\nfiords, are either partly or entirely filled by arms of the sea; in the\r\nformer case, the shores are fertile and inhabited, and the whole country\r\nabounds in the most picturesque scenery. Fiords are not peculiar to the\r\ncoast of Norway; they are even more extensive in Greenland and Iceland,\r\nand of a more stern character, overhung by snow-clad rocks and glaciers.\r\n\r\nAs the Scandinavian mountains, those of Feroe, Britain, Ireland, and the\r\nnorth-eastern parts of Iceland, have a similar character, and follow the\r\nsame general directions, they must have been elevated by forces acting\r\nin parallel lines, and therefore may be regarded as belonging to the\r\nsame system.\r\n\r\nThe Feroe islands, due west from Norway, rise at once in a table-land\r\n2000 feet high, bounded by precipitous cliffs, which dip into the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe rocky islands of Zetland, and those of Orkney, form part of the\r\nmountain system of Scotland; the Orkney islands have evidently been\r\nseparated from the mainland by the Pentland Firth, where the currents\r\nrun with prodigious violence. The north-western part of Scotland is a\r\ntable-land from 1000 to 2000 feet high, which ends abruptly in the sea,\r\ncovered with heath, peat-mosses, and pasture. The general direction of\r\nthe Scottish mountains, like those of Scandinavia, is from north-east to\r\nsouth-west, divided by a long line of lakes in the same direction,\r\nextending from the Moray Firth completely across the island to south of\r\nthe island of Mull. Lakes of the most picturesque beauty abound among\r\nthe Scottish mountains. The Grampian hills, with their offsets and some\r\nlow ranges, fill the greater part of Scotland north of the Clyde and\r\nForth. Ben Nevis, only 4374 feet above the sea, is the highest hill in\r\nthe British islands.\r\n\r\nThe east coast of Scotland is generally bleak, though in many parts it\r\nis extremely fertile, and may be cited as a model of good cultivation;\r\nand the midland and southern counties are not inferior either in the\r\nquality of the soil or the excellence of the husbandry. To the west the\r\ncountry is wildly picturesque; the coast of the Atlantic, penetrated by\r\nthe sea, which is covered with islands, bears a strong resemblance to\r\nthat of Norway.\r\n\r\nThere cannot be a doubt that the Hebrides formed part of the mainland at\r\nsome remote geological period, since they follow the direction of the\r\nmountain system in two parallel lines of rugged and imposing aspect,\r\nnever exceeding the height of 3200 feet. The undulating country on the\r\nborders of Scotland becomes higher in the west of England and North\r\nWales, where the hills are wild, but the valleys are cultivated like\r\ngardens, and the English lake-scenery is of the most gentle beauty.\r\n\r\nEvergreen Ireland is mostly a mountainous country, and opposes to the\r\nAtlantic storms an iron-bound coast of the wildest aspect; but it is\r\nrich in arable land and pasture, and possesses the most picturesque\r\nlake-scenery: indeed, freshwater lakes in the mountain valleys, so\r\npeculiarly characteristic of the European system, are the great\r\nornaments of the high lands of Britain.\r\n\r\nVarious parts of the British islands were dry land while most of the\r\ncontinent of Europe was yet below the ancient ocean. The high land of\r\nLammermuir and the Grampian hills in Scotland, and those of Cumberland\r\nin England, were raised before the Alps had begun to appear above the\r\nwaves. In general, all the highest parts of the British mountains are of\r\ngranite and stratified crystalline rocks. The primary fossiliferous\r\nstrata are of immense thickness in Cumberland and in the north of Wales,\r\nand the old red sandstone, many hundred feet thick, stretches from sea\r\nto sea along the flanks of the Grampians. The coal strata are developed\r\non a great scale in the south of Scotland and the north of England; and\r\nexamples of every formation, with the exception of the muschelkalk, are\r\nto be found in these islands. Volcanic fires had been very active in\r\nearly times, and nowhere is the columnar structure more beautifully\r\nexhibited than in Fingal’s Cave and the Storr of Skye, in the Hebrides:\r\nand in the north of Ireland a base of 800 square miles of mica-slate is\r\ncovered with volcanic rocks, which end on the coast in the magnificent\r\ncolumns of the Giant’s Causeway.\r\n\r\nThe Ural chain, the boundary between Europe and Asia, is the only\r\ninterruption to the level of the great northern plain, and is altogether\r\nunconnected with and far separated from the Altaï mountains by salt\r\nlakes, marshes, and deserts. The central ridge may be traced from\r\nbetween the Lake of Aral and the Caspian Sea to the northern extremity\r\nof Nova Zemlia, a distance of more than 1700 miles; but as a chain it\r\nreally begins on the right bank of the Ural river, at the steppes of the\r\nKirghiz, about the 51st degree of north latitude, and runs due north in\r\na long narrow ridge to the Karskaïa Gulf, in the Polar Ocean, though it\r\nmay be said to terminate in dreary rocks on the west side of Nova\r\nZemlia. The Ural range is about the height of the mountains in the Black\r\nForest or the Vosges; and, with few exceptions, it is wooded to the top,\r\nchiefly by the Pinus cembra. The immense mineral riches of these\r\nmountains—gold, platina, magnetic iron, and copper—lie on the Siberian\r\nside, and mostly between the 54th and 60th degrees of north latitude:\r\nthe only part that is colonized, and one of the most industrious and\r\ncivilized regions of the Russian empire. To the south the chain is\r\npastoral, about 100 miles broad, consisting of longitudinal ridges, the\r\nhighest of which does not exceed 3498 feet: in this part diamonds are\r\nfound. To the north of the mining district the narrow mural mass is\r\ncovered with impenetrable forests and deep morasses, altogether\r\nuninhabitable and unexplored. Throughout the Ural mountains there are\r\nneither precipices, transverse gorges, nor any of the characteristics of\r\na high chain; the descent on both sides is so gentle that in many places\r\nit is difficult to know where the plain begins; and the road over the\r\nchain from Russia by Ekaterinburg is so low that it hardly seems to be a\r\nmountain-pass. The gentle descent and sluggishness of the streams\r\nproduce extensive marshes along the Siberian base of the range. To the\r\narduous and enterprising researches of Sir Roderick Murchison we are\r\nindebted for almost all we know of these mountains: he found them on the\r\nwestern side to be composed of Silurian, Devonian, and carboniferous\r\nrocks, more or less altered and crystallized; on the eastern declivity\r\nthe mines are in metamorphic strata, mixed with rocks of igneous origin;\r\nand the central axis is of quartzose and chloritic rocks.\r\n\r\nThe great zone of high land which extends along the old continent from\r\nthe Atlantic to the shores of the Pacific Ocean divides the low lands\r\ninto two very unequal parts. That to the north, only broken by the Ural\r\nrange of the Valdai table-land of still less elevation, stretches from\r\nthe Thames or the British hills, and the eastern bank of the Seine to\r\nBehring’s Straits, including more than 190° of longitude, and occupying\r\nan area of at least 4,500,000 square geographical miles, which is a\r\nthird more than all Europe. The greater part of it is perfectly level,\r\nwith a few elevations and low hills, and in many places a dead level\r\nextends hundreds of miles. The country between the Carpathian and Ural\r\nmountains is a flat on which there is scarcely a rise in 1500 miles; and\r\nin the steppes of southern Russia and Siberia the extent of level ground\r\nis immense. The mean absolute height of the flat provinces of France is\r\n480 feet. Moscow, the highest point of the European plain, is also 480\r\nfeet high, from whence the land slopes imperceptibly to the sea both on\r\nthe north and south, till it absolutely dips below its level. Holland,\r\non one side, would be overflowed, were it not for its dykes, and towards\r\nAstrakan the plain sinks still lower. With the exception of the plateau\r\nof Ust-Urt, of no great elevation, situated between the Caspian and\r\nAral, and which is the extreme southern ridge of the Ural chain, the\r\nwhole of that extensive country north and east of the Caspian Sea and\r\naround the Lake of Aral forms a vast cavity of 18,000 square leagues,\r\nall considerably below the level of the ocean; and the surface of the\r\nCaspian Sea itself, the lowest point, has a depression of rather more\r\nthan 83 feet.\r\n\r\nThe European part of the plain is highly cultivated, and very productive\r\nin the more civilized countries, in its western and middle regions, and\r\nalong the Baltic. The greatest amount of cultivated land lies to the\r\nnorth of the watershed which stretches from the Carpathians to the\r\ncentre of the Ural chain, yet there are large heaths which extend from\r\nthe extremity of Jutland through Lunebourg and Westphalia to Belgium.\r\nThe land is of excellent quality to the south of it. Round Polkova and\r\nMoscow there is an extent of the finest vegetable mould, equal in size\r\nto France and the Spanish peninsula together, which forms part of the\r\nHigh Steppe, and is mostly in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the great plain is pasture-land, and wide tracts are\r\ncovered with natural forests, especially in Poland and Russia, where\r\nthere are millions of acres of pine, fir, and deciduous trees.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of waste land in Europe is very great, and there are also\r\nmany swamps. A morass as long as England extends from the 52d parallel\r\nof latitude, following the course of the river Prepit, a branch of the\r\nDnieper, which runs through its centre. There are swamps at the mouths\r\nof many of the sluggish rivers in Central Europe. They cover 1970 miles\r\nin Denmark, and mossy quagmires occur frequently in the more northerly\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nTowards the eastern extremity of Europe the great plain assumes the\r\npeculiar character of desert called a _steppe_, a word supposed to be of\r\nTartar origin, signifying a level waste destitute of trees: hence the\r\nsteppes may vary according to the nature of the soil. They commence in\r\nthe river Dnieper, and extend along the shores of the Black Sea. They\r\ninclude all the country north and east of the Caspian lake and\r\nIndependent Tartary; and, passing between the Ural and Altaï mountains,\r\nthey may be said to occupy all the low lands of Siberia. Hundreds of\r\nleagues may be traversed east from the Dnieper without variation of\r\nscene. A dead level of thin but luxuriant pasture, bounded only by the\r\nhorizon, day after day the same unbroken monotony fatigues the eye.\r\nSometimes there is the appearance of a lake, which vanishes on approach,\r\nthe phantom of atmospheric refraction. Horses and cattle beyond number\r\ngive some animation to the scene, so long as the steppes are green; but\r\nwinter comes in October, and they then become a trackless field of\r\nspotless snow. Fearful storms rage, and the dry snow is driven by the\r\ngale with a violence which neither man nor animal can resist, while the\r\nsky is clear and the sun shines cold and bright above the earthly\r\nturmoil. The contest between spring and winter is long and severe, for\r\n\r\n           “Winter oft at once resumes the breeze,\r\n           Chills the pale morn, and bids his driving sleets\r\n           Deform the day, delightless.”\r\n\r\nYet when gentler gales succeed, and the waters run off in torrents\r\nthrough the channels which they cut in the soft ground, the earth is\r\nagain verdant. The scorching summer’s sun is as severe in its\r\nconsequences in these wild regions as the winter’s cold. In June the\r\nsteppes are parched, no shower falls, nor does a drop of dew refresh the\r\nthirsty and rent earth. The sun rises and sets like a globe of fire, and\r\nduring the day he is obscured by a thick mist from the evaporation. In\r\nsome seasons the drought is excessive: the air is filled with dust in\r\nimpalpable powder, the springs become dry, and cattle perish in\r\nthousands. Death triumphs over animal and vegetable nature, and\r\ndesolation tracks the scene to the utmost verge of the horizon, a\r\nhideous wreck.\r\n\r\nMuch of this country is covered by an excellent but thin soil, fit for\r\ncorn, which grows luxuriantly wherever it has been tried; but a stiff\r\ncold clay at a small distance below the surface kills every herb that\r\nhas deep roots, and no plants thrive but those which can resist the\r\nextreme vicissitudes of climate. A very wide range is hopelessly barren.\r\nThe country from the Caucasus, along the shores of the Black and Caspian\r\nSeas—a dead flat, twice the size of the British islands—is a desert\r\ndestitute of fresh water. Saline efflorescences cover the surface like\r\nhoar-frost. Even the atmosphere and the dew are saline, and many salt\r\nlakes in the neighbourhood of Astrakan furnish great quantities of\r\ncommon salt and nitre. Saline plants, with patches of verdure few and\r\nfar between, are the only signs of vegetable life, but about Astrakan\r\nthere is soil and cultivation. Some low hills occur in the country\r\nbetween the Caspian and the Lake of Aral, but it is mostly an ocean of\r\nshifting sand, often driven by appalling whirlwinds.\r\n\r\nTurkistan is a sandy desert, except on the banks of the Oxus and the\r\nJaxartes, and as far on each side of them as canals convey the\r\nfertilizing waters. To the north, barrenness gives place to verdure\r\nbetween the river Ural and the terraces and mountains of Central Asia,\r\nwhere the steppes of the Kirghiz afford pasture to thousands of camels\r\nand cattle belonging to these wandering hordes.\r\n\r\nSiberia is either a dead level or undulating surface of more than\r\n7,000,000 of square miles between the North Pacific and the Ural\r\nmountains, the Polar Sea and the Altaï range, whose terraces and offsets\r\nend in those plains, like headlands and promontories in the ocean. M.\r\nMiddendorf, indeed, met with a chain of most desolate mountains on the\r\nshores of the Polar Ocean, in the country of the Samoides; and the\r\nalmost inapproachable coast far to the east is unexplored. The mineral\r\nriches of the mountains have brought together a population who inhabit\r\ntowns of considerable importance along the base of the Ural and Altaï\r\nchains, where the ground yields good crops and pasture; and there are\r\nforests on the undulations of the mountains and on the plains. There are\r\nmany hundred square miles of rich black mould covered with trees and\r\ngrass, uninhabited, between the river Tobal and the upper course of the\r\nObi, within the limit where corn would grow; but even this valuable soil\r\nis studded with small lakes of salt and fresh water, a chain of which,\r\n300 miles long, skirts the base of the Ural mountains.\r\n\r\nNorth of the 62d parallel of latitude corn does not ripen on account of\r\nthe biting blasts from the Icy Ocean, which sweep supreme over these\r\nunprotected wastes. In a higher latitude, even the interminable forests\r\nof gloomy fir are seen no more: all is a wide-spreading desolation of\r\nsalt steppes, boundless swamps, and lakes of salt and fresh water. The\r\ncold is so intense there that the spongy soil is perpetually frozen to\r\nthe depth of some hundred feet below the surface; and the surface\r\nitself, not thawed before the end of June, is again ice-bound by the\r\nmiddle of September, and deep snow covers the ground nine or ten months\r\nin the year. Happily, gales of wind are not frequent during winter, but\r\nwhen they do occur no living thing ventures to face them. The Russian\r\nAdmiral Wrangel, who travelled during the most intense cold from the\r\nmouth of the river Kolyma to Behring’s Strait, gives an appalling\r\naccount of these deserts. “Here endless snows and ice-covered rocks\r\nbound the horizon, nature lies shrouded in all but perpetual winter,\r\nlife is a constant conflict with privation and with the terrors of cold\r\nand hunger—the grave of nature, which contains only the bones of another\r\nworld. The people, and even the snow smokes, and this evaporation is\r\ninstantly changed into millions of needles of ice, which make a noise in\r\nthe air like the sound of torn satin or thick silk. The reindeer take to\r\nthe forest, or crowd together for heat, and the raven alone, the dark\r\nbird of winter, still cleaves the icy air with slow and heavy wing,\r\nleaving behind him a long line of thin vapour, marking the track of his\r\nsolitary flight. The trunks of the thickest trees are rent with a loud\r\nnoise, masses of rock are torn from their sites, the ground in the\r\nvalleys is rent into yawning fissures, from which the waters that are\r\nunderneath rise, giving off a cloud of vapour, and immediately become\r\nice. The atmosphere becomes dense, and the glistening stars are dimmed.\r\nThe dogs outside the huts of the Siberians burrow in the snow, and their\r\nhowling, at intervals of six or eight hours, interrupts the general\r\nsilence of winter.”[33] In many parts of Siberia, however, the sun,\r\nthough long absent from these dismal regions, does not leave them to\r\nutter darkness. The extraordinary brilliancy of the stars, and the\r\ngleaming snowlight, produce a kind of twilight, which is augmented by\r\nthe splendid coruscations of the aurora borealis.\r\n\r\nThe scorching heat of the summer’s sun produces a change like magic on\r\nthe southern provinces of the Siberian wilderness. The snow is scarcely\r\ngone before the ground is covered with verdure, and flowers of various\r\nhues blossom, bear their seeds, and die in a few months, when Winter\r\nresumes his empire. A still shorter-lived vegetation scantily covers the\r\nplains in the far north, and, on the shores of the Icy Ocean, even\r\nreindeer-moss grows scantily.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of fur-bearing animals in the less rigorous parts of the\r\nSiberian deserts has tempted the Russians to colonize and build towns on\r\nthese frozen plains. Yakutsk, on the river Lena, in 62° 1ʹ 30ʺ N. lat.,\r\nis probably the coldest town on the earth. The ground is perpetually\r\nfrozen to the depth of more than 400 feet, of which three feet only are\r\nthawed in summer, when Fahrenheit’s thermometer is frequently 77° in the\r\nshade; and as there is in some seasons no frost for four months, larch\r\nforests cover the ground, and wheat and rye produce from fifteen to\r\nforty fold. In winter the cold is so intense that mercury is constantly\r\nfrozen two months, and occasionally even three.\r\n\r\nIn the northern parts of Europe the Silurian, Devonian, and\r\ncarboniferous strata are widely developed, and more to the south they\r\nare followed in ascending order by immense tracts of the higher series\r\nof secondary rocks, abounding in the huge monsters of a former world.\r\nVery large and interesting tertiary basins fill the ancient hollows in\r\nmany parts of the plain, which are crowded with the remains of animals\r\nthat no longer exist. Of these, the most important are the London,\r\nParis, Vienna, and Moscow basins, with many others in the north of\r\nGermany and Russia; and alluvial soil covers the greater part of the\r\nplain. In the east, Sir Roderick Murchison has determined the boundary\r\nof a region twice as large as France, extending from the Polar Ocean to\r\nthe southern steppes, and from beyond the Volga to the flanks of the\r\nUral chain, which consists of a red deposit of sand and marl, full of\r\ncopper in grains, belonging to the Permian system. This, and the immense\r\ntract of black loam already mentioned, are among the principal features\r\nof Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Low Lands of the Great Continent, with their Secondary\r\n  Table-Lands and Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE low lands to the south of the great mountain girdle of the old\r\ncontinent are much broken by its offsets, by separate groups of\r\nmountains, and still more by the deep indentation of bays and large\r\nseas. Situate in lower latitudes, and sheltered by mountains from the\r\ncutting Siberian winds, these plains are of a more tropical character\r\nthan those to the north; but they are strikingly contrasted in their\r\ndifferent parts—either rich in all the exuberance that heat, moisture,\r\nand soil can produce, or covered by wastes of bare sand—in the most\r\nadvanced state of cultivation, or in the wildest garb of nature.\r\n\r\nThe barren parts of the low lands lying between the eastern shores of\r\nChina and the Indus bear a small proportion to the riches of a soil\r\nvivified by tropical warmth and watered by the periodical inundations of\r\nthe mighty rivers that burst from the icy caverns of Tibet and the\r\nHimalaya. On the contrary, the favoured regions in that part of the low\r\nlands lying between the Persian Gulf, the Euphrates, and the Atlas\r\nmountains, are small when compared with the immense expanse of the\r\nArabian and African deserts, scorched and calcined by an equatorial sun.\r\nThe blessing of a mountain-zone, pouring out its everlasting treasures\r\nof moisture, the life-blood of the soil, is nowhere more strikingly\r\nexhibited than in the contrast formed by these two regions of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe Tartar country of Mandshur, watered by the river Amour, but little\r\nknown to Europeans, lies immediately south of the Yablonnoi branch of\r\nthe Altaï chain, and consequently partakes of the desert aspect of\r\nSiberia, and, in its northern parts, even of the Great Gobi. It is\r\npartly intersected by mountains, and covered by dense forests;\r\nnevertheless, oats grow in the plains, and even wheat in sheltered\r\nplaces. Towards Corea the country is more fertile; in that peninsula\r\nthere are cultivated plains at the base of its central mountain-range.\r\n\r\nChina is the most productive country on the face of the earth; an\r\nalluvial plain of 210,000 square miles, formed by one of the most\r\nextensive river systems in the old world, occupies its eastern part.\r\nThis plain, seven times the size of Lombardy, is no less fertile, and\r\nperfectly irrigated by canals. The Great Canal traverses the eastern\r\npart of the plain for 700 miles, of which 500 are in a straight line of\r\nconsiderable breadth, with a current in the greater part of it. Most\r\npart of the plain is in rice and garden ground, the whole cultivated\r\nwith the spade. The tea-plant grows on a low range of hills between the\r\n30th and 32d parallels of north latitude, an offset from the Pe-ling\r\nchain. The cold in winter is much greater than in the corresponding\r\nEuropean latitudes, and the heat in summer is proportionally excessive.\r\n\r\nThe Indo-Chinese peninsula, lying between China and the river\r\nBrahmapootra, has an area of 77,700 square miles, and projects 1500\r\nmiles into the ocean. The plains lying between the offsets descending\r\nfrom the east end of the Himalaya, and which divide it longitudinally,\r\nas before mentioned, are very extensive. The Birman empire alone, which\r\noccupies the valley of the Irrawaddy, is said to be as large as France,\r\nand not less fertile, especially its southern part, which is the granary\r\nof the empire. Magnificent rivers intersect the alluvial plains, whose\r\nsoil they have brought down from the table-land of Tibet, and still\r\ncontinue to deposit in great quantities in the deltas at their mouths.\r\n\r\nThe plains of Hindostan extend 2000 miles along the southern slope of\r\nthe Himalaya and Hindoo Coosh, between the Brahmapootra and the Indus,\r\nand terminate on the south in the Bay of Bengal, the table-land of the\r\nDeccan, and the Indian Ocean—a country embracing in its range every\r\nvariety of climate from tropical heat and moisture to the genial\r\ntemperature of southern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Ganges is one of the richest on the globe, and\r\ncontains a greater extent of vegetable mould, and of land under\r\ncultivation, than any other country in this continent, except perhaps\r\nthe Chinese empire. In its upper part, Sirhind and Delhi, the seat of\r\nthe ancient Mogul empire, still rich in splendid specimens of Indian\r\nart, are partly arid, although in the latter there is fertile soil. The\r\ncountry is beautiful where the Jumna and other streams unite to form the\r\nGanges. These rivers are often hemmed in by rocks and high banks, which\r\nin a great measure prevent the periodical overflow of the waters; this,\r\nhowever, is compensated by the coolness and moisture of the climate. The\r\nland gradually improves towards the east, as it becomes more flat, till\r\nat last there is not a stone to be seen for hundreds of miles down to\r\nthe Gulf of Bengal. Wheat and other European grain are produced in the\r\nupper part of this magnificent valley, while in the south every variety\r\nof Indian fruit, rice, cotton, indigo, opium, and sugar, are the staple\r\ncommodities. The ascent of the plain of the Ganges from the Bay of\r\nBengal is so gradual that Saharampore, nearly at the foot of the\r\nHimalaya, is only 1100 feet above the level of Calcutta; the consequence\r\nof which is that the Ganges and Brahmapootra, with their branches, in\r\nthe rainy season between June and September, lay Bengal under water for\r\nhundreds of miles in every direction, like a great sea. When the water\r\nsubsides, the plains are verdant with rice and other grain; but when\r\nharvest is over, and the heat is intense, the scene is changed—the\r\ncountry, divested of its beauty, becomes parched and dusty everywhere,\r\nexcept in the extensive jungles. It has been estimated that one-third of\r\nthe British territory in India is covered with these rank marshy tracts.\r\nIt was estimated by Lord Cornwallis, and confirmed by Mr. Colebrooke,\r\nthat a third of the East India Company’s territory is jungle.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula of Hindostan is occupied by the triangular-shaped\r\ntable-land of the Deccan, which is much lower, and totally unconnected\r\nwith the table-land of Tibet. It has the primary ranges of the Ghauts on\r\nthe east and west, and the Vendhya mountains on the north, sloping by\r\nsuccessive levels to the plains of Hindostan Proper. A trace of the\r\ngeneral equatorial direction of the Asiatic high land is still\r\nperceptible in the Vendhya mountains, sometimes called the central chain\r\nof India, and in the Saulpoora range to the south, both being nearly\r\nparallel to the Himalaya.[34] The surface of the Deccan between 3000 and\r\n4000 feet above the sea is a combination of plains, ridges of rock, and\r\ninsulated flat-topped hills, which are numerous, especially in its\r\nnorth-eastern parts. These solitary and almost inaccessible heights rise\r\nabruptly from the plains, with all but perpendicular sides, which can\r\nonly be scaled by steps cut in the rock, or by very dangerous paths.\r\nMany are fortified, and were the strongholds of the natives, but they\r\nnever have withstood the determined intrepidity of British soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula terminates with the table-land of the Mysore, 7000 feet\r\nabove the sea, surrounded by the Nilgherry or Blue Mountains, which rise\r\n2941 feet higher.\r\n\r\nThe base of this plateau, and indeed of all the Deccan is granite, and\r\nthere are also many syenitic and trap rocks, with abundance of primary\r\nand secondary fossiliferous strata. Though possessing the diamond-mines\r\nof Golconda, the true riches of the country consist in its vegetable\r\nmould, which in the Mysore is 100 feet thick, an inexhaustible source of\r\nfertility. The sea-coasts on the two sides of the peninsula are\r\nessentially different: that of Malabar on the western side is rocky, but\r\nin many parts well cultivated, and its mountains covered with forests\r\nform a continuous wall of very simple structure, 510 miles long, and\r\nrather more than 5000 feet high. On the coast of Coromandel the\r\nmountains are bare, lower, frequently interrupted, and the wide maritime\r\nplains are for the most part parched.\r\n\r\nThe island of Ceylon, nearly equal in extent to Ireland, is almost\r\njoined to the southern extremity of the peninsula by sandbanks and small\r\nislands, between which the water is only six feet deep in spring tides.\r\nThe Sanscrit name of the “Resplendent” may convey some idea of this\r\nisland, rich and fertile in soil, adorned by lofty mountains, numerous\r\nstreams, and primeval forests; in addition to which it is rich in\r\nprecious stones, and has the pearl oyster on its coast.\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic low lands are continued westward from the Indian peninsula\r\nby the Punjab and the great Indian desert. “The Punjab, or country of\r\nthe five rivers,” lies at the base of the Hindoo Coosh. Its most\r\nnorthern part consists of fertile terraces highly cultivated, and\r\nvalleys at the foot of the mountains. It is very productive in the plain\r\nwithin the limits of the periodical inundations of the rivers, and where\r\nit is watered by canals; in other parts it is pastoral. Lahore occupies\r\nthe chief part of the Punjab, and the city of that name on the Indus,\r\nonce the rival of Delhi, lies on the high road from Persia to India, and\r\nwas made the capital of the kingdom by Runjeet Sing. The valley of the\r\nIndus throughout partakes of the character of the Punjab; it is fertile\r\nonly where it is within reach of water; much of it is delta, which is\r\noccupied by rice-grounds; the rest is pasture, or sterile salt marshes.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Punjab, and between the fertile plains of Hindostan and the\r\nleft bank of the Indus, lies the great Indian desert, which is about 400\r\nmiles broad, and becomes more and more arid as it approaches the river.\r\nIt consists of a hard clay, covered with shifting sand, driven into high\r\nwaves by the wind, with some parts that are verdant after the rains. In\r\nthe province of Cutch, south of the desert, a space of 7000 square\r\nmiles, known as the Run of Cutch, is alternately a sandy desert and an\r\ninland sea. In April the waves of the sea are driven over it by the\r\nprevailing winds, leaving only a few grassy eminences, the resort of\r\nwild asses. The desert of Mekram, an equally barren tract, extends along\r\nthe Gulf of Oman from the mouths of the Indus to the Persian Gulf: in\r\nsome places, however, it produces the Indian palm and the aromatic\r\nshrubs of Arabia Felix. It was the line followed by Alexander the Great\r\nreturning with his army from India.\r\n\r\nThe scathed shores of the Arabian Gulf, where not a blade of grass\r\nfreshens the arid sands, and the uncultivated valleys of the Euphrates\r\nand Tigris, separate Asia from Arabia and Africa, the most desert\r\nregions in the old world.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula of Arabia, divided into two parts by the Tropic of Cancer,\r\nis about four times the size of France. No rivers, and few streams or\r\nsprings nourish the thirsty land, whose barren sands are scorched by a\r\nfierce sun. The central part is a table-land of moderate height, which,\r\nhowever, is said to have an elevation of 8000 feet in the province of\r\nHaudramaut. To the south of the tropic it is an almost interminable\r\nocean of drifting sand, wafted in clouds by the gale, and dreaded even\r\nby the wandering Bedouin. At wide intervals, long narrow depressions\r\ncheer the eye with brushwood and verdure. More to the north, mountains\r\nand hills cross the peninsula from S.E. to N.W., enclosing cultivated\r\nand fine pastoral valleys adorned by grooves of the date-palm and\r\naromatic shrubs. Desolation once more resumes its domain where the\r\ntable-land sinks into the Syrian desert, and throughout the rest of its\r\ncircumference it descends in terraces or parallel ranges of mountains\r\nand hills to a flat sandy coast from 30 to 100 miles wide, which\r\nsurrounds the greater part of the peninsula, from the mouths of the\r\nEuphrates to the Isthmus of Suez. The hills come close to the beach in\r\nthe province of Oman, which is traversed by chains, and broken into\r\npiles of arid mountains not more than 3500 feet high, with the exception\r\nof the Jebel Okkdar, which is 6000 feet above the sea, and is cleft by\r\ntemporary streams and fertile valleys. Here the ground is cultivated and\r\ncovered with verdure, and still farther south there is a line of oases\r\nfed by subterraneous springs, where the fruits common to Persia, India\r\nand Arabia, are produced.\r\n\r\nThe south-eastern coast is scarcely known, except towards the provinces\r\nof Haudramaut and Yemen or Arabia Felix, where ranges of mountains, some\r\nabove 5000 feet high, line the coast, and in many places project into\r\nthe ocean, sometimes forming excellent harbours, as that of Aden, which\r\nis protected by projecting rocks. In the intervals there are towns and\r\nvillages, cotton-plantations, date-groves, and cultivated ground.\r\n\r\nOn the northern side of these granite ranges, where the table-land is\r\n8000 feet above the sea, and along the edge of the desert of El Aklaj in\r\nHaudramaut, there is a tract of land so loose and so very fine, that a\r\nplummet was sunk in it by Baron Wrede to the depth of 360 feet without\r\nreaching the bottom. There is a tradition in the country that the Sabæan\r\narmy of King Suffi perished in attempting to cross this desert. Arabia\r\nFelix, which merits its name, is the only part of that country with\r\npermanent streams, though they are small. Here also the mountains and\r\nfertile ground run far inland, producing grain, pasture, coffee,\r\nodoriferous plants, and gums. High cliffs line the shores of the Indian\r\nOcean and the Strait of Bab-el-man-deb—“the Gate of Tears.” The fertile\r\ncountry is continued a considerable way along the coast of the Red Sea,\r\nbut the character of barrenness is resumed by degrees, till at length\r\nthe hills and intervening terraces, on which Mecca and Medina, the holy\r\ncities of the Mahomedans, stand, are sterile wastes wherever springs do\r\nnot water them. The blast of the desert, loaded with burning sand,\r\nsweeps over these parched regions. Mountains skirt the table-land to the\r\nnorth; and the peninsula, between the Gulfs of Akabah and Suez on the\r\nRed Sea, the Eliath of Scripture, is filled by the mountain-group of\r\nSinai and Horeb. Jebel Houra, Mount Sinai, on which Moses received the\r\nTen Commandments, is 9000 feet high, surrounded by higher mountains,\r\nwhich are covered with snow in winter. The group of Sinai abounds in\r\nsprings and verdure. At its northern extremity lies the desert of\r\nEl-Teh, 70 miles long and 30 broad, in which the Israelites wandered\r\nforty years. It is covered with long ranges of high rocks, of most\r\nrepulsive aspect, rent into deep clefts only a few feet wide, hemmed in\r\nby walls of rock sometimes 1000 feet high, like the deserted streets of\r\na Cyclopean town. The journey from Sinai to Akabah, by the Wadee-el-Ain\r\nor Valley of the Spring, is perfectly magnificent, and the site of Petra\r\nitself is a tremendous confusion of black and brown mountains. It is a\r\nconsiderable basin closed in by rocks, with chasms and defiles in the\r\nprecipices. The main street is 2 miles long, and not more than from 10\r\nto 30 feet wide, enclosed between perpendicular rocks from 100 to 700\r\nfeet high, which so nearly meet as to leave only a strip of sky. A\r\nstream runs through the street which must once have been a considerable\r\ntorrent, and the precipitous rocks are excavated into thousands of\r\ncaverns once inhabited—into conduits, cisterns, flights of steps,\r\ntheatres, and temples, forming altogether one of the most wonderful\r\nremains of antiquity. The whole of Arabia Petrea, Edom of the sacred\r\nwriters, presents a scene of appalling desolation, completely fulfilling\r\nthe denunciation of prophecy.[35]\r\n\r\nA sandy desert, crossed by low limestone ridges, separates the\r\ntable-land of Arabia from the habitable part of Syria, which the\r\nmountains of Lebanon divide into two narrow plains. These mountains may\r\nalmost be considered offsets from the Taurus chain; at least they are\r\njoined to it by the wooded range of Gawoor, the ancient Amanus,\r\nimpassable except by two defiles, celebrated in history as the Amanic\r\nand Syrian Gates. The group of Lebanon begins with Mount Casius, which\r\nrises abruptly from the sea in a single peak to the height of 7000 feet,\r\nnear the mouth of the Orontes. From thence the chain runs south, at a\r\ndistance of about twenty miles from the shores of the Mediterranean, in\r\na continuous line of peaks to the sources of the Jordan, where it splits\r\ninto two nearly parallel naked branches, enclosing the wide and fertile\r\nplain of Beka or Ghor, the ancient Cœlo-Syria, in which are the ruins of\r\nBalbec.\r\n\r\nThe Lebanon branch terminates at the sea near the mouth of the river\r\nLeontes, a few miles north of the city of Old Tyre; while the\r\nAnti-Libanus, which begins at Mount Hermon, 9000 feet high, runs west of\r\nthe Jordan through Palestine in a winding line, till its last spurs,\r\nsouth of the Dead Sea, sink into rocky ridges on the desert of Sinai.\r\n\r\nThe tops of all these mountains, from Scanderoon to Jerusalem, are\r\ncovered with snow in winter; it is permanent on Lebanon only, whose\r\nabsolute elevation is 9300 feet. The precipices are terrific, the\r\nsprings abundant, and the spurs of the mountains are studded with\r\nvillages and convents; there are forests in the higher grounds, and,\r\nlower down, vineyards and gardens. Many offsets from the Anti-Libanus\r\nend in precipices on the coast between Tripoli and Beyrout, among which\r\nthe scenery is superb.\r\n\r\nThe valleys and plains of Syria are full of rich vegetable mould,\r\nparticularly the plain of Damascus, which is brilliantly verdant, though\r\nsurrounded by deserts, the barren uniformity of which is relieved on the\r\neast by the broken columns and ruined temples of Palmyra (Tadmor). The\r\nAssyrian wilderness, however, is not everywhere absolutely barren. In\r\nthe spring-time it is covered with a thin but vivid verdure, mixed with\r\nfragrant aromatic herbs, of very short duration. When these are burnt\r\nup, the unbounded plains resume their wonted dreariness. The country,\r\nhigh and low, becomes more barren towards the Holy Land, yet even here\r\nsome of the mountains—as Carmel, Bashan, and Tabor—are luxuriantly\r\nwooded, and many of the valleys are fertile, especially the valley of\r\nthe Jordan, which has the appearance of pleasure-grounds with groves of\r\nwood and aromatic plants, but almost in a state of nature. One side of\r\nthe Lake of Tiberias in Galilee is savage; on the other there are gentle\r\nhills and wild romantic vales, adorned with palm-trees, olives, and\r\nsycamores—a scene of calm solitude and pastoral beauty. Jerusalem stands\r\non a declivity encompassed by severe stony mountains, wild and desolate.\r\nThe greater part of Syria is a desert compared with what it formerly\r\nwas. Mussulman rule has blighted this fair region, once flowing with\r\nmilk and honey—the Land of Promise.\r\n\r\nFarther south, desolation increases; the valleys become narrower, the\r\nhills more denuded and rugged, till, south of the Dead Sea, their dreary\r\naspect announces the approach of the desert.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Jordan affords the most remarkable instance known of\r\nthe depression of the land below the general surface of the globe. This\r\nhollow, which extends from the Gulf of Akabah on the Red Sea to the\r\nbifurcation of Lebanon, is 620 feet below the Mediterranean at the Sea\r\nof Galilee, and the acrid waters of the Dead Sea have a depression of\r\n1300 feet.[36] The lowness of the valley had been observed by the\r\nancients, who gave it the descriptive name of Cœlo-Syria, “Hollow\r\nSyria.” It is absolutely walled in by mountains between the Dead Sea and\r\nLebanon, where it is from ten to fifteen miles wide.[37]\r\n\r\nA shrinking of the strata must have taken place along this coast of the\r\nMediterranean, from a sudden change of temperature in the earth’s crust,\r\nor perhaps in consequence of some of the internal props giving way, for\r\nthe valley of the Jordan is not the only instance of a dip of the soil\r\nbelow the sea-level: the small bitter lakes on the Isthmus of Suez are\r\ncavities of the same kind, as well as the Natron lakes on the Libyan\r\ndesert, west from the delta of the Nile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nAfrica—Table-Land—Cape of Good Hope and Eastern Coast—Western Coast—\r\n  Abyssinia—Senegambia—Low Lands and Deserts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE continent of Africa is 5000 miles long from the Cape of Good Hope to\r\nits northern extremity, and as much between Cape Guardafuï, on the\r\nIndian Ocean, and Cape Verde, on the Atlantic; but from the irregularity\r\nof its figure it has an area of only 12,000,000 of square miles. It is\r\ndivided in two by the equator, consequently the greater part of it lies\r\nunder a tropical sun. The high and low lands of this portion of the old\r\ncontinent are so distinctly separated by the Mountains of the Moon, or\r\nrather of Komri, that, with the exception of the mountainous territory\r\nof the Atlas, and the small table-land of Barca, it may be said to\r\nconsist of two parts only, a high country and a low.\r\n\r\nAn extensive, though not very elevated, table-land occupies all Southern\r\nAfrica, and even reaches to six or seven degrees north of the equator.\r\nOn three sides it shelves down in tiers of narrow parallel terraces to\r\nthe ocean, separated by mountain-chains which rise in height as they\r\nrecede from the coast; and there is reason to believe that the structure\r\nof the northern declivity is similar, though its extremities only are\r\nknown—namely, Abyssinia on the east, and the high land of Senegambia on\r\nthe west; both of which project farther to the north than the central\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThe borders of the table-land are very little known to Europeans, and\r\nstill less its surface, which no white man has crossed north of the\r\nTropic of Capricorn. A comparatively small part, north from the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, has been explored by European travellers. Mr. Truter and Mr.\r\nSomerville were the first white men whom the inhabitants of Litakoo had\r\nseen. Of an expedition that followed their track, a few years after, no\r\none returned.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Cape the land rises to 6000 feet above the sea; and the\r\nOrange River, or Gareep, with its tributaries, may be more aptly said to\r\ndrain than to irrigate the arid country through which they flow; many of\r\nthe tributaries, indeed, are only the channels through which torrents,\r\nfrom the periodical rains, are carried to the Orange River, and are\r\ndestitute of water many months in the year. The “Dry River,” the name of\r\none of these periodical streams, is in that country no misnomer. Their\r\nmargins are adorned with mimosas, and the sandy plains have furnished\r\ntreasures to the botanist; and, indeed, zoology is no less indebted to\r\nthe whole continent of Africa for the various animals it produces.\r\n\r\nDr. Smith crossed the Tropic of Capricorn in a journey from the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, where the country had still the same arid character. North\r\nfrom that there is a vast tract unexplored. In 1802 two native\r\ntravelling merchants crossed the continent, which is 1590 miles wide,\r\nfrom Loando on the Atlantic to Zambeze on the Mozambique Channel. They\r\nfound various mercantile nations, considerably advanced in civilization,\r\nwho raise abundance of maize and millet, though the greater part of the\r\ncountry is in a state of nature. Ridges of low hills, yielding copper,\r\nthe staple commodity of this country, run from S.E. to N.W. to the west\r\nof the dominions of the Camleaze, a country full of rivers, morasses,\r\nand extensive salt marshes which supply this part of the continent with\r\nsalt. The travellers crossed 102 rivers, most of them fordable. The\r\nleading feature of this country is Lake N’yassi, of great, but unknown\r\nlength, and comparatively narrow. It begins 200 miles north from the\r\ntown of Tete, on the Zambeze, and extends from S.E. to N.W., flanked on\r\nthe east by a range of mountains of the same name, running in the same\r\ndirection, at the distance of 350 miles from the Mozambique Channel.\r\nThis is all we know from actual observation of the table-land of South\r\nAfrica, till about the 10th northern meridian, where Dr. Beke’s\r\nAbyssinian journey terminated. It is evident, however, that there can be\r\nno very high mountains covered with perpetual snow on the table-land,\r\nfor, if there were, Southern Africa would not be destitute of great\r\nrivers; nevertheless, the height of the table-land, and of the mountains\r\nof Komri on its northern edge, must be considerable, to supply the\r\nperennial sources of the Nile, the Senegal, and the Niger.\r\n\r\nThe edges of the table-land are better known. At the Cape of Good Hope\r\nthe African continent is about 700 miles broad, and ends in three narrow\r\nparallel ridges of mountains, the last of which is the highest, and\r\nabuts on the table-land. All are cleft by precipitous deep ravines,\r\nthrough which winter torrents flow to the ocean. The longitudinal\r\nvalleys, or koroos, that separate them, are tiers, or steps, by which\r\nthe plateau dips to the maritime plains. The descent is rapid, as both\r\nthese plains and the mountain-ranges are very narrow. On the western\r\nside the mountains form a high group and end in steep promontories on\r\nthe coast, where Table Mountain, at Cape Town, 3582 feet high, forms a\r\nconspicuous landmark for mariners.\r\n\r\nGranite, which is the base of Southern Africa, rises to a considerable\r\nheight in many places, and is generally surmounted by vast horizontal\r\nbeds of sand-stone, which give that character of flatness peculiar to\r\nthe summits of many of the Cape mountains.\r\n\r\nThe koroos are arid deserts in the dry season, but soon after the rains\r\nthey are covered with verdure and a splendid flora. The maritime plains\r\npartake of the same temporary aridity, though a large portion is rich in\r\ncereal productions, vineyards, fruits, and pasture.\r\n\r\nThe most inland of the parallel ranges, about the 20th meridian east, is\r\n10,000 feet high, and, though it sinks to some groups of hills at its\r\neastern extremity, it rises again, about the 27th meridian, in a truly\r\nalpine and continuous chain—the Quotlamba mountains, which follow the\r\nnortherly direction of Natal, and are continued in the Lupata range of\r\nhills, 80 miles inland, through Zanguebar.\r\n\r\nAt Natal the coast is grassy, with clumps of trees, like an English\r\npark. The Zambeze, and other streams from the table-land, refresh the\r\nplains on the Mozambique Channel and Zanguebar, where, though some parts\r\nare marshy and covered with mangroves, groves of palm-trees adorn the\r\nplains, which yield prodigious quantities of grain, and noble forests\r\ncover the mountains; but from 4° N. latitude to Cape Guardafuï is a\r\ncontinued desert. There is also a barren tract at the southern end of\r\nthe Lupata chain, where gold is found in masses and grains on the\r\nsurface and in the watercourses, which tempted the Portuguese to make\r\nsettlements on these unwholesome coasts.\r\n\r\nThe island of Madagascar, with its magnificent range of mountains, full\r\nof tremendous precipices, and covered with primeval forests, is parallel\r\nto the African coast, and only separated from it by the Mozambique\r\nChannel, 300 miles broad, so it may be presumed that it rose from the\r\ndeep at the same time as the Lupata chain.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the eastern and western coasts of South Africa is\r\nvery great. The escarped bold mountains round the Cape of Good Hope, and\r\nits rocky coast, which extends a short way along the Atlantic to the\r\nnorth, are succeeded by ranges of sandstone of small elevation, which\r\nseparate the internal sandy desert from the equally parched sandy shore.\r\nThe terraced dip of the Atlantic coast for 900 miles, between the Orange\r\nRiver and Cape Negro, has not a drop of fresh water.\r\n\r\nAt Cape Negro, ranges of mountains, separated by long level tracts,\r\nbegin, and make a semicircular bend into the interior, leaving plains\r\nalong the coast 140 miles broad. In Benguela these plains are healthy\r\nand cultivated; farther north there are monotonous grassy savannahs, and\r\nforests of gigantic trees. The ground, in many places saturated with\r\nwater, bears a tangled crop of mangroves and tall reeds, which even\r\ncover the shoals along the coasts; but pestilential vapours hang over\r\nthem, never dissipated by a breeze.\r\n\r\nThe country of Calbongos is the highest land on the coast, where a\r\nmagnificent group of mountains, covered almost to their tops with large\r\ntimber, lie not far inland. The low plains of Biafra and Benin, west of\r\nthem, and especially the delta of the Niger, consist entirely of swamps\r\nloaded with rank vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe angel of Death, brooding over these regions in noisome exhalations,\r\nguards the interior of that country from the aggressions of the\r\nEuropean, and has hitherto baffled his attempts to form settlements on\r\nthe banks of this magnificent river.\r\n\r\nMany portions of North Guinea are so fertile that they might vie with\r\nthe valley of the Nile in cereal riches, besides various other\r\nproductions; and though the temperature is very high, the climate is not\r\nvery unhealthy.\r\n\r\nNo European has yet seen the high mountains of Komri, generally known as\r\nthe Mountains of the Moon, which are said to cross the continent along\r\nthe northern edge of the great plateau, between the two projections or\r\npromontories of Abyssinia and Senegambia. This chain divides the\r\nsemi-civilized states of Soudan, Bornou, and Begharmi from the barbarous\r\nnations on the table-land. It extends south of Abyssinia at one end, at\r\nthe other it joins the high land of Senegambia, and is continued in the\r\nKong range, which runs 1200 miles behind Dahomy and the Gold Coast, and\r\nends in the promontory of Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\nThe vast alpine promontory of Abyssinia or Ethiopia, 700 miles wide,\r\nprojects from the table-land for 300 miles into the low lands of North\r\nAfrica. It dips to a low swampy region on the north, to the plains of\r\nSenaar and Kordofan on the west, and on the east sinks abruptly to the\r\ncoast at a short distance from the Red Sea. It is there from 800 to 900\r\nfeet high, but declines to the westward, so that in the 15th parallel of\r\nN. latitude the eastern slope of the table-land towards the Red Sea is\r\nnearly twenty times greater than the counter-slope towards the Nile; the\r\nedge of the latter, however, is from 3000 to 4000 feet above the\r\nplains.[38] The character of Abyssinia is in that respect like the\r\nDeccan, or Southern India, where the Ghauts rise abruptly near the coast\r\nof Malabar, and the surface falls gradually towards that of Coromandel.\r\nThe table-land of Abyssinia is a succession of undulating plains, broken\r\nby higher insulated mountain-masses, which in Samien, Godjam, and in\r\nKaffa more to the south, attain an absolute altitude of from 11,000 to\r\n15,000 feet. The plains are intersected by numerous streams which form\r\nthe Nile and its tributaries on the one hand, and the Hawásh and its\r\naffluents, which flow into the Indian Ocean, on the other. The edge of\r\nthe table-land towards the Nile is steep; the streams run to the low\r\nlands through valleys from 3000 to 4000 feet deep, so that a traveller\r\nin ascending them might imagine that he is crossing a mountain-range,\r\nwhereas, on coming to the top, he finds himself on a high plain. This\r\nelevated country has lakes, swamps, verdant meadows, and cultivated\r\nland, producing various grains, and occasionally coffee. The plain of\r\nthe Dembia, the granary of the country, enjoys perpetual spring. Dr.\r\nBeke, to whom we are indebted for so much valuable information with\r\nregard to this part of Africa, travelled to within less than ten degrees\r\nof the equator, and, from the accounts he received, the country south of\r\nAbyssinia appears to be similar to those of Shoa and Godjam—extensive\r\nundulating plains, with occasional mountain-masses, and traversed by\r\nnumerous streams; wide tracts must be 7000 or 8000 feet high, as they\r\nonly produce barley: the country towards Kaffa and the sources of the\r\nGojeb is still higher, and in some parts desert; but the caravan-road\r\nbetween Wallega and Kaffa passes through a vast forest impervious to the\r\nrays of the sun, which, according to the accounts of the merchants, is\r\nnot seen for four or five days successively; and west of the Dedhesa\r\nthere are immense grassy plains, the elephant-hunting grounds of the\r\nGalla tribes.\r\n\r\nThe geological structure of Abyssinia is similar to that of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, the base being granite and the superstructure sandstone,\r\noccasionally limestone, schist, and breccia. The granite comes to the\r\nsurface in the lower parts of Abyssinia, but sandstone predominates in\r\nthe upper parts, and assumes a tabular form, often lying on the tops of\r\nthe mountains in enormous flat masses, only accessible by steps cut in\r\nthe rocks or by ladders: such insulated spots are used as state prisons.\r\nLarge tracts are of ancient volcanic rocks, especially in Shoa.\r\n\r\nSenegambia, the appendage to the western extremity of the table-land,\r\nalso projects far into the low lands, and is the watershed whence the\r\nstreams flow on one side to the plains of Soudan, where they join the\r\nJoliba or Niger; and from the other side, the Gambia, Senegal, and other\r\nrivers, run into the Atlantic over a rich cultivated plain, but\r\nunhealthy from the rankness of the vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe moisture that descends from the northern edge of the table-land of\r\nSouth Africa, under the fiery radiance of a tropical sun, fertilizes a\r\ntract of country stretching from sea to sea across the continent, the\r\ncommencement of the African low lands. A great part of this region,\r\nwhich contains many kingdoms and commercial cities, is a very productive\r\ncountry. The abundance of water, the industry of the natives in\r\nirrigating the ground, the periodical rains, and the tropical heat,\r\nleave the soil no repose. Agriculture is in a rude state, but nature is\r\nso bountiful that rice and millet are raised in sufficient quantity to\r\nsupply the wants of a numerous population. Gold is found in the\r\nriver-courses, and there are elephants in the forests; but man is the\r\nstaple of their commerce—a disgrace to the savage who sells his\r\nfellow-creature, but a far greater disgrace to the more savage purchaser\r\nwho dares to assume the sacred name of Christian.\r\n\r\nThis long belt of never-failing vitality, which has its large lakes,\r\npoisonous swamps, deep forests of gigantic trees, and vast solitudes in\r\nwhich no white men ever trade, is of small width compared with its\r\nlength. In receding from the mountains, the moisture becomes less and\r\nthe soil gradually worse, sufficing only to produce grass for the flocks\r\nof the wandering Bedouin. At last a hideous barren waste begins, which\r\nextends northwards 800 miles in unvaried desolation to the grassy\r\nsteppes at the foot of the Atlas; and for 1000 miles between the\r\nAtlantic and the Red Sea the nakedness of this blighted land is unbroken\r\nbut by the valley of the Nile and a few oases.\r\n\r\nIn the west about 760,000 miles, an area equal to that of the\r\nMediterranean Sea, and, in some parts, of a lower level, is covered by\r\nthe trackless sands of the Sahara desert, which is even prolonged for\r\nmiles into the Atlantic Ocean in the form of sandbanks. This desert is\r\nalternately scorched by heat and pinched by cold. The wind blows from\r\nthe east nine months in the year; and at the equinoxes it rushes in a\r\nhurricane, driving the sand in clouds before it, producing the darkness\r\nof night at midday, and overwhelming caravans of men and animals in\r\ncommon destruction. Then the sand is heaped up in waves ever varying\r\nwith the blast; even the atmosphere is of sand. The desolation of this\r\ndreary waste, boundless to the eye as the ocean, is terrific and\r\nsublime; the dry heated air is like a red vapour, the setting sun seems\r\nto be a volcanic fire, and at times the burning wind of the desert is\r\nthe blast of death. There are many salt lakes to the north, and even the\r\nsprings are of brine; thick incrustations of dazzling salt cover the\r\nground, and the particles, carried aloft by whirlwinds, flash in the sun\r\nlike diamonds.\r\n\r\nSand is not the only character of the desert; tracts of gravel and low\r\nbare rocks occur at times, not less barren and dreary; but on the\r\neastern and northern borders of the Sahara, fresh water rises near the\r\nsurface, and produces an occasional oasis where barrenness and vitality\r\nmeet. The oases are generally depressed below the level of the desert,\r\nwith an arenaceous or calcareous border enclosing their emerald verdure\r\nlike a frame. The smaller oases produce herbage, ferns, acacias, and\r\nsome shrubs; forests of date-palms grow in the larger, which are the\r\nresort of lions, panthers, gazelles, reptiles, and a variety of birds.\r\n\r\nIn the Nubian and Libyan deserts, to the east of the Sahara, the\r\ncontinent shelves down towards the Mediterranean in a series of\r\nterraces, consisting of vast level sandy or gravelly deserts, lying east\r\nand west, separated by low rocky ridges. This shelving country, which is\r\nonly 540 feet above the sea at the distance of 750 miles inland, is cut\r\ntransversely by the Nile, and by a deep furrow parallel to it, in which\r\nthere is a long line of oases. This furrow, the Nile, and the Red Sea,\r\nnearly parallel to both, are flanked by rocky eminences which run north\r\nfrom the table-land.\r\n\r\nOn the interminable sands and rocks of these deserts no animal—no\r\ninsect—breaks the dread silence; not a tree nor a shrub is to be seen in\r\nthis land without a shadow. In the glare of noon the air quivers with\r\nthe heat reflected from the red sand, and in the night it is chilled\r\nunder a clear sky sparkling with its host of stars. Strangely but\r\nbeautifully contrasted with these scorched solitudes is the narrow\r\nvalley of the Nile, threading the desert for 1000 miles in emerald\r\ngreen, with its blue waters foaming in rapids among wild rocks, or\r\nquietly spreading in a calm stream amidst fields of corn and the august\r\nmonuments of past ages.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of a few days’ journey west from the Nile, over a\r\nhideous flinty plain, lies the furrow already mentioned, trending to the\r\nnorth, and containing the oases of Darfour, Selime, the Great and Little\r\nOases, and the parallel valleys of the Natron Lakes, and Bahr-Belama or\r\nthe “Dry River.” The Great Oasis, or Oasis of Thebes, is 120 miles long\r\nand 4 or 5 broad; the Lesser Oasis, separated from it by 40 miles of\r\ndesert, is of the same form. Both are rich in verdure and cultivation,\r\nwith villages amid palm-groves and fruit-trees, mixed with the ruins of\r\nremote antiquity, offering scenes of peaceful and soft beauty contrasted\r\nwith the surrounding gloom. The Natron Lakes are in the northern part of\r\nthe Valley of Nitrùn, 35 miles west of the Nile; the southern part is a\r\nbeautiful quiet spot, that became the retreat of Christian monks in the\r\nmiddle of the second century, and at one time contained 360 convents, of\r\nwhich 4 only remain; from these some very valuable manuscripts of old\r\ndate have recently been obtained.\r\n\r\nAnother line of oases runs along the latitude of Cairo, with fresh-water\r\nlakes—consequently no less fertile than the preceding. The ruins of the\r\nTemple of Jupiter Ammon are in one of them.\r\n\r\nHundreds of miles on the northern edge of the desert, from the Atlantic\r\nalong the southern foot of the Atlas to the Great Syrtis, are\r\npasture-lands without a tree—an ocean of verdure. At the Great Syrtis\r\nthe Sahara comes to the shores of the Mediterranean; and, indeed, for\r\n1100 miles between the termination of the Atlas and the little\r\ntable-land of Barca, the ground is so unprofitable that the population\r\nonly amounts to about 30,000, and these are mostly wandering tribes who\r\nfeed their flocks on the grassy steppes. Magnificent countries lie along\r\nthe Mediterranean coast north of the Atlas, susceptible of cultivation.\r\nHistory, and the ruins of many great cities, attest their former\r\nsplendour; even now there are many populous commercial cities, and much\r\ngrain is raised, though a great part of these valuable kingdoms is badly\r\ncultivated or not cultivated at all.\r\n\r\nThe base of the sandy parts of North Africa is stiff clay; in Lower\r\nNubia, between the parallels of Assouan and Esneh, red and white granite\r\nprevail, followed by argillaceous sandstone; Middle Egypt is calcareous;\r\nand, lower down, the alluvium of the Nile covers the surface.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that Southern Africa, though similar in its unbroken\r\nsurface and peninsular shape to South America, bears no resemblance to\r\nit in other respects, but has a great analogy to the Deccan in its\r\ntriangular form, its elevated platform, and in the position of its\r\nencompassing mountain-chains, if, as there is every reason to believe,\r\nfrom the fertile region to the north, either that South Africa descends\r\nin a succession of terraces to the low lands, or that the Komri\r\nmountains have a real existence, and run directly across the continent.\r\nFrom the connection already mentioned between external appearance and\r\ninternal structure, as well as from partial information, it is surmised\r\nthat the mountains surrounding the two triangles in question are of\r\ncorresponding constitution; that, if any secondary strata do exist in\r\nthis part of Africa, they must be exterior to these chains, and neither\r\non the summits of the high mountains nor in the interior; and that any\r\ntertiary strata on the table-land must, as in the Deccan, have formed\r\nthe basins of fresh-water lakes.[39]\r\n\r\nThe prodigious extent of desert is one of the most extraordinary\r\ncircumstances in the structure of the old continent. A zone of almost\r\nirretrievable desolation prevails from the Atlantic Ocean across Africa\r\nand through central Asia almost to the Pacific Ocean, through at least\r\n120 degrees of longitude. There are also many long districts of the same\r\nsterile nature in Europe; and if to these sandy plains the deserts of\r\nSiberia be added, together with all the barren and rocky mountain\r\ntracts, the unproductive land in the Old World is prodigious. The\r\nquantity of salt on the sandy plains is enormous, and proves that they\r\nhave been part of the bed of the ocean or of inland seas at no very\r\nremote geological period. The low lands round the Black Sea and Caspian,\r\nand the Lake of Aral, seem to have been the most recently reclaimed,\r\nfrom the great proportion of shells in them identical with those now\r\nexisting in these seas. The same may be said of the Sahara desert, where\r\nsalt and recent shells are plentiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nAmerican Continent—The Mountains of South America—The Andes—The\r\n  Mountains of the Parima and Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME thinner portion of the crust of the globe under the meridians that\r\ntraverse the continent of America from Cape Horn to the Arctic Ocean\r\nmust have yielded to the expansive forces of the subterranean fires, or\r\nbeen rent by contraction of the strata in cooling. Through this the\r\nAndes had arisen, producing the greatest influence on the form of the\r\ncontinent, and the peculiar simplicity that prevails in its principal\r\nmountains systems, which, with very few exceptions, have a general\r\ntendency from north to south. The continent is 9000 miles long, and, its\r\nform being two great peninsulas joined by a long narrow isthmus, it is\r\ndivided by nature into three parts, of South, Central, and North\r\nAmerica; yet these three are connected by the mighty chain of the Andes,\r\nbut little inferior in height to the Himalaya, running along the coast\r\nof the Pacific from within the Arctic nearly to the Antarctic circle. In\r\nthis course every variety of climate is to be met with, from the rigour\r\nof polar congelation to the scorching heat of the torrid zone; while the\r\nmountains are so high that the same extremes of heat and cold may be\r\nexperienced in the journey of a few hours from the burning plains of\r\nPeru to the snow-clad peaks above. In this long chain there are three\r\ndistinct varieties of character, nearly, though not entirely,\r\ncorresponding to the three natural divisions of the continent. The Andes\r\nof South America differ materially from those of Central America and\r\nMexico, while both are dissimilar to the North American prolongation of\r\nthe chain, generally known as the Chippewayan or Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe greatest length of South America, from Cape Horn to the Isthmus of\r\nPanamá is about 4020 geographical miles. It is very narrow at its\r\nsouthern extremity, but increases in width northwards to the latitude of\r\nCape Roque on the Atlantic, between which and Cape Blanco on the Pacific\r\nit attains its greatest breadth of nearly 2750 miles. It consists of\r\nthree mountain systems, separated by the basins of three of the greatest\r\nrivers in the world. The Andes run along the western coast from Cape\r\nHorn to the Isthmus of Panamá, in a single chain of inconsiderable width\r\nbut majestic height, dipping rapidly to the narrow maritime plains of\r\nthe Pacific, but descending on the east in high valleys and occasional\r\noffsets to plains of vast extent, whose dead level is for hundreds of\r\nmiles as unbroken as that of the ocean by which they are bounded.\r\nNevertheless, two detached mountain systems rise on these plains, one in\r\nBrazil between the Rio de la Plata and the river of the Amazons; the\r\nother is that of Parima and Guiana, lying between the river of the\r\nAmazons and the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nThe great chain of the Andes first raises its crest above the waves of\r\nthe Antarctic Ocean in the majestic dark mass of Cape Horn, the\r\nsouthernmost point of the archipelago of Tierra del Fuego. This group of\r\nmountainous islands, equal in size to Britain, is cut off from the main\r\nland by the Straits of Magellan. The islands are penetrated in every\r\ndirection by bays and narrow inlets of the sea, or fiords, ending often\r\nin glaciers fed by the snow on the summits of mountains 6000 feet high.\r\nPeatmosses cover the higher declivities of these mountains, and their\r\nflanks are beset with densely entangled forests of brown beech, which\r\nnever lose their dusky leaves, producing altogether a savage, dismal\r\nscene. The mountains which occupy the western side of this cluster of\r\nislands sink down to wide level plains to the east, like the continent\r\nitself, of which the archipelago is but the southern extremity.[40]\r\n\r\nThe Pacific washes the very base of the Patagonian Andes for about 1000\r\nmiles, from Cape Horn to the 40th parallel of south latitude. The whole\r\ncoast is lined by a succession of archipelagos and islands, separated\r\nfrom the iron-bound shores by narrow arms of the sea, which, in the more\r\nsouthern part, are in fact profound longitudinal valleys of the Andes\r\nfilled by the ocean, so that the chain of islands running parallel to\r\nthe axes of the mountains is but the summits of an exterior range rising\r\nabove the sea.\r\n\r\nThe coast itself for 650 miles is begirt by walls of rock, which sink\r\ninto unfathomable depths, torn by long crevices or fiords, similar to\r\nthose on the Norwegian shore, ending in tremendous glaciers, whose\r\nmasses, falling with a crash like thunder, drive the sea in sweeping\r\nbreakers through these chasms. The islands and the mainland are thickly\r\nclothed with forests, which are of a less sombre aspect as the latitude\r\ndecreases.\r\n\r\nBetween the Pass of Chacabuco north of Santiago, the capital of Chile,\r\nand the archipelago of Chiloe, a chain of hills, composed in general of\r\ncrystalline rocks, borders the coast; between which and the Andes exists\r\na longitudinal valley, well watered by the rivers descending from the\r\ncentral chain, and which constitutes the most fertile portion, nay the\r\ngarden of the Chillian republic—the rich provinces of Santiago,\r\nColchagua, and Maule. This longitudinal depression may be considered as\r\na prolongation of the strait that separates Chiloe from the mainland.\r\nMany peaks of the Andes enter within the limits of perpetual snow,\r\nbetween the 40th and 31st parallels; and some of which are active\r\nvolcanos. In lat. 32° 39ʹ rises the giant of the American Andes, the\r\nNevado of Aconcagua, which towers over the Chillian village of the same\r\nname, and is so clearly visible from Valparaiso. Although designated as\r\na volcano, a term generally applied in Chile to every elevated and snowy\r\npeak, it offers no trace of modern igneous origin. It appears to be\r\ncomposed of a species of porphyry generally found in the centre of the\r\nChillian chain. Its height, according to Captain Beechey’s very accurate\r\nobservations, exceeds 24,000 feet.[41]\r\n\r\nAbout the latitude of Concepcion the dense forests of Araucarias and of\r\nother semi-tropical plants cease with the humid equable climate; and as\r\nno rain falls in central Chile for nine months in the year, the brown,\r\npurple, and tile-red hills and mountains are only dotted here and there\r\nwith low trees and bushes; very soon, however, after the heavy showers\r\nhave moistened the cracked ground, it is covered with a beautiful but\r\ntransient flora. In some valleys it is more permanent and of a tropical\r\ncharacter, mixed with alpine plants.[42] In southern Chile rain falls\r\nonly once in two or three years, the consequence of which is sterility\r\non the western precipitous and unbroken descent of the Andes; but on the\r\neast, two secondary branches leave the central Cordillera, which extend\r\n300 or 400 miles into the plains, wooded to a great height. The Sierra\r\nde Cordova, the most southern of these, begins between the 33d and 31st\r\nparallels, and extends in the direction of the Pampas; more to the\r\nnorth, the Sierra di Salta and Juguy stretches from the valley of\r\nCatamarca and Tucuman towards the Rio Vermejo, one of the tributaries of\r\nthe Rio de la Plata.\r\n\r\nThe chain takes the name of the Peruvian Andes about the 24th degree of\r\nsouth latitude, and is separated from the Pacific by a range of hills\r\ncomposed of crystalline rocks, and parallel to the sea coast, and of an\r\nintervening sandy desert, seldom above 60 miles broad, on which rain\r\nscarcely ever falls, where bare rocks pierce through the moving sand.\r\nThe width of the coast is nearly the same to the Isthmus of Panamá, but\r\ndamp luxuriant forests full of orchideæ, begin about the latitude of\r\nPayta, and continue northwards.\r\n\r\nFrom its southern extremity to the Nevado of Chorolque, in 21° 30ʹ S.\r\nlat., the Andes are merely one grand and continuous range of mountains,\r\nbut north of that the chain intercepts a very elevated table-land, or\r\nwide longitudinal valley, in the direction of the chain, bounded on each\r\nside by a parallel range of high mountains, rising much above it. These\r\nparallel Cordilleras are united at various points by enormous transverse\r\ngroups or mountain-knots, or by single ranges crossing between them like\r\ndykes, a structure that prevails to Pasto, 1° 13ʹ 6ʺ N. lat. The descent\r\nto the Pacific is very steep; the dip is also very rapid to the east,\r\nwhence offsets diverge to the level plains.\r\n\r\nUnlike the table-lands of Asia of the same elevation, where cultivation\r\nis confined to the more sheltered spots, or those still lower in Europe,\r\nwhich are only fit for pasture, these lofty regions of the Andes yield\r\nexuberant crops of every European grain, and have many populous cities\r\nenjoying the luxuries of life, with universities, libraries, civil and\r\nreligious establishments, at altitudes equal to that of the Peak of\r\nTeneriffe, which is 12,170 feet above the sea-level. Villages are placed\r\nand mines are worked at heights as great and even greater than the top\r\nof Mont Blanc.[43] This state is not limited to the present times, since\r\nthese table-lands were once the centre of civilization by a race of\r\nmankind which “bear the same relation to the Incas and the present\r\ninhabitants that the Etruscans bear to the ancient Romans and to the\r\nItalians of our own days.”\r\n\r\nThe table-land or valley of Desaguadero, one of the most remarkable of\r\nthese, has an absolute altitude of 12,900 feet, and a breadth varying\r\nfrom 30 to 60 miles: it stretches 400 miles between the two parallel\r\nchains of the Andes, and between the transverse mountain-group of Lipez,\r\nin 20° S. lat., and the enormous mountain-knot of Vilcañota, which,\r\nextending from east to west, shuts in the valley on the north-west, and\r\noccupying an area three times as large as Switzerland, some of the snowy\r\npeaks rising 8300 feet above the surface of the table-land, from which\r\nan idea may be formed of the gigantic scale of the Andes. This\r\ntable-land or valley is bounded on each side by the two grand chains of\r\nthe Bolivian Andes: that on the west is the Cordillera of the coast; the\r\nrange on the east is the Bolivian Cordillera, properly speaking; and on\r\nits north-west prolongation the Cordillera Real.[44] These two rows of\r\nmountains lie so near the edge that the whole breadth of the table-land,\r\nincluding both, is only 226 miles. All the snowy peaks of the\r\nCordilleras of the coast are either active volcanoes or of igneous\r\norigin, and are all situate near the maritime declivity of the chain;\r\nconsequently, the descent is very abrupt. The eastern Cordillera, which\r\nbegins at the metalliferous mountain of Potosi, is below the level of\r\nperpetual snow to the south, but its northern portion contains the three\r\npeaked mountains of Sorata, of Supäíwasi, and Illimani, and is one of\r\nthe most magnificent portions of the Andes.[45] The snowy part begins\r\nwith the gigantic mass of Illimani, whose serrated ridges are elongated\r\nin the direction of the axis of the chain. The lowest glacier on its\r\nsouthern slope does not descend below 16,500 feet, and the valley of\r\nTotoral, a mere gulf in which Vesuvius might stand, comes between\r\nIllimani and the Nevado of La Mesada, from whence the eastern Cordillera\r\nruns to the north-west in a continuous line of snow-clad peaks to the\r\ngroup of Vilcañoto, where it unites with the Cordillera of the coast.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Desaguadero, occupying 150,000 square miles, has a\r\nconsiderable variety of surface; in the south, throughout the mining\r\ndistrict, it is poor and cold. Potosi, the highest city in the world,\r\nstands at an absolute elevation of 13,330 feet, at the foot of a\r\nmountain celebrated for its silver mines. Chiquisaca, the capital of\r\nBolivia, containing 13,000 inhabitants, lies to the north-east of\r\nPotosi, in the midst of cultivated fields. The northern part of the\r\nvalley is populous, and produces wheat, barley, and other grain; and the\r\nLake of Titicaca, twenty times as large as the Lake of Geneva, fills the\r\nnorth-western portion of this great basin. The islands and shores of\r\nthis lake still exhibit ruins of gigantic magnitude, monuments of a\r\npeople more ancient than the Incas. The modern city of La Paz with\r\n40,000 inhabitants, not far from its southern shores, stands in the most\r\nsublime situation that can be imagined, having in full view the vast\r\nNevado of Illimani to the east-south-east at a distance of seven\r\nleagues.\r\n\r\nMany offsets leave the eastern side of the Bolivian Cordillera which\r\nterminates in the great plain of Chiquitos and Paraguay; the most\r\nimportant is the Cordillera of Yuracaraës, which bounds the rich valley\r\nof Cochabamba on the north, and ends near the town of Santa Cruz de la\r\nSierra.\r\n\r\nThere are some fertile valleys in the snow-capped group of Vilcañota and\r\nCusco. The city of Cusco, which contains nearly 50,000 inhabitants, was\r\nthe capital of the empire of the Incas: it still contains numerous ruins\r\nof that dynasty, among which the remains of the Temple of the sun and\r\nits Cyclopean Fortress still mark its former splendour. Four ancient\r\nPeruvian roads led from Cusco to the different parts of the empire,\r\nlittle inferior in many respects to the old Roman ways: all crossing\r\nmountain-passes higher than the Peak of Teneriffe. On the northern\r\nprolongation of the chain, in lat. 11° S., encircled by the Andes, is\r\nthe elevated plain of Bombon, near to the celebrated silver-mines of\r\nPasco, at a height of 14,000 feet above the sea. In it is situated the\r\nLake of Lauricocha, which may be considered, from its remoteness, as one\r\nof the sources of the Amazon. There are many small lakes on the\r\ntable-lands and high valleys of the Andes, some even within the range of\r\nperpetual snow. They are very cold and deep, often of the purest\r\nsea-green colour; some of them may have been craters of extinct\r\nvolcanos.\r\n\r\nThe chain of the Andes is divided into three ranges of mountains running\r\nfrom south to north in the transverse group or mountain-knot of Pasco\r\nand Huanuco, which shuts in the valley of Bombon between the 11th and\r\n10th parallels of south latitude: that in the centre separates the wide\r\nfertile valley of the Upper Marañon from the still richer valley of the\r\nHuallaga, whilst the more eastern forms the barrier between the latter\r\nand the tropical valley of the Yucayali. The western chain alone reaches\r\nthe limit of perpetual snow, and, if we except the Nevado of Huaylillas,\r\nin 7° 50ʹ, no mountain north of this for nearly 400 miles to the Andes\r\nof Quito arrives at the snow-line.\r\n\r\nIn lat. 4° 50ʹ S. the Andes form the mountain-knot of Loxa, once\r\ncelebrated for its forests, in which the cinchona or Peruvian bark was\r\ndiscovered. From this knot the chain divides into two great longitudinal\r\nridges or cordilleras, in an extent of 350 miles, passing through the\r\nrepublic of the Equator to the mountain-group of Los Pastos in that of\r\nNew Grenada. These ridges enclose a vast longitudinal valley, which,\r\ndivided by the cross ridges of Assuay and Chisinche into three basins,\r\nform the valleys of Cuença, Tapia, and Quito. The plain of Cuença offers\r\nlittle interest; that of Tapia is magnificent; whilst the valley of\r\nQuito is one of extraordinary beauty: on either side rise a series of\r\nsnow-capped peaks, celebrated in every way in the history of science, as\r\nthe valley itself is in that of the aboriginal races of the New World.\r\nHere the energies of volcanic action have been studied with the greatest\r\nfruits; here, now one hundred years ago, took place that measurement of\r\nan arc of the meridian which afforded the most accurate data at the time\r\ntowards the determination of the mass and form of our planet, and which\r\nhas conferred eternal honour on the body with which it originated, the\r\nFrench Academy of Sciences; and celebrity on the names of Bouguier, La\r\nCondamine, and Godin, Don George Juan and Ulloa, who conducted it on the\r\npart of the crowns of France and of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Cordillera or ridge which hems in the valley of Quito on the east\r\ncontains the snow-capped peaks of Antisana, Cotopaxi, one of the most\r\nbeautiful of active volcanoes, whose dazzling cone rises to a height of\r\n18,775 feet, of Tungaragua and el-Altar, the latter once equal to\r\nChimborazo in height, and Sangay. The western range includes the\r\ngigantic Chimborazo, which may be seen from the coast of the Pacific,\r\nthe pyramidal peak of Illinissa, the wreck of an ancient volcano. The\r\nheight of Illinissa was measured by the French Academicians, by very\r\ncareful operations, directly above the level of the ocean, the latter\r\nbeing visible from it; and by its means the absolute elevation of the\r\nvalley of Quito, and of the other peaks that encircle it, was deduced,\r\nas well as the first approximate value of the barometrical coefficient.\r\nNorth of Chimborazo and near it is the Carguäirazo, and close to the\r\ncity of Quito rises the scarcely less celebrated volcano of Pichincha,\r\nwhilst the Nevado of Cayambè, whose summit, elevated 19,535 feet, is\r\ntraversed by the terrestrial equator, perhaps the greatest and most\r\nremarkable landmark on the surface of our planet, closes the north-east\r\nextremity of the valley.\r\n\r\nThe valley of Quito, one of the finest in the Andes, is 200 miles long\r\nand 30 wide, with a mean altitude of 10,000 feet, bounded by the most\r\nmagnificent series of volcanoes and mountains in the New World. A\r\npeculiar interest is attached to two of the many volcanos in the\r\nparallel Cordilleras that flank it on each side. The beautiful snow-clad\r\ncone of Cayambè Urcu, as already stated, traversed by the equator, the\r\nmost remarkable division of the globe closes it on the north; and in the\r\nwestern Cordillera the cross still stands on the summit of Pichincha,\r\n15,924 feet above the Pacific, which served for a signal to Bouguier and\r\nLa Condamine in their memorable measurement of an arc of the\r\nmeridian.[46]\r\n\r\nSome parts of the plain of Quito to the south are sterile, but the soil\r\ngenerally is good, and perpetual spring clothes it with exuberant\r\nvegetation. The city of Quito, containing 70,000 inhabitants, on the\r\nside of Pichincha has an absolute height of 9540 feet. The city is well\r\nbuilt and handsome; the churches are splendid; it possesses\r\nuniversities, the comforts and luxuries of civilized life, in a\r\nsituation of unrivalled grandeur and beauty. Thus, on the very summit of\r\nthe Andes there is a world by itself, with its mountains and its\r\nvalleys, its lakes and rivers, populous towns and cultivated fields.\r\nMany monuments of the Incas are still found in good preservation in\r\nthese plains, where the scenery is most noble—eleven volcanic cones are\r\nvisible from one spot. Although the Andes are inferior in height to the\r\nHimalaya, yet the domes of trachyte, the truncated cones of the active\r\nvolcanos, and the serrated ruins of those that are extinct, mixed with\r\nthe bold features of primary mountains, give an infinitely greater\r\nvariety to the scene, while the smoke, and very often the flame, issuing\r\nfrom these regions of perpetual snow increase its sublimity. Stupendous\r\nas these mountains appear even from the plains of the table-land, they\r\nare merely the inequalities of the tops of the Andes, the serrated\r\nsummit of that mighty chain.\r\n\r\nBetween the large group of Los Pastos, containing several active\r\nvolcanos, and the group of Las Papas, in the second degree of north\r\nlatitude, the bottom of the valley is only 6900 feet above the sea; and\r\nnorth of the latter mountain-knot the crest of the Andes splits into\r\nthree Cordilleras, which diverge not again to unite. The most westerly\r\nof these, the chain of Choco, which may be considered the continuation\r\nof the great chain, divides the valley of the river Cauca from the\r\nPacific; it is only 5000 feet high, and the lowest of the three. Though\r\nbut 20 miles broad, it is so steep, and so difficult of access, that\r\ntravellers cannot cross it on mules, but are carried on men’s shoulders:\r\nit is rich in gold and platina. The central branch, or Cordillera of\r\nQuindiu, runs due north between the Magdalena and Cauca, rising to a\r\ngreat height in the volcanic Peak of Tolima. The two last chains are\r\nunited by the mountain-knot of Antioquia, of which little more is known\r\nthan that it forms two great masses, which, after separating the streams\r\nof the Magdalena, Cauca, and Atrato, trends to the N.W., greatly reduced\r\nin height, and with the chain of Choco forms the low mountains of the\r\nIsthmus of Panamá. The most easterly of the three Cordilleras, called\r\nthe Sierra de la Summa Paz, spreads out on its western declivity into\r\nthe table-lands of Bogota, Tunja, and others, the ancient Cundinamarca,\r\nwhich have an elevation of about 9000 feet; whilst on its eastern slope\r\nrise the rivers Guaviari and Meta, which form the head waters of the\r\nOrinoco. The tremendous crevice of Icononzo occurs in the path leading\r\nfrom the city of Santa Fé de Bogota to the banks of the Magdalena. It\r\nprobably was formed by an earthquake, and is like an empty mineral vein,\r\nacross which are two natural bridges: the lowest is composed of stones\r\nthat have been jammed between the rocks in their fall.[47] This\r\nCordillera comprises the Andes of Cundinamarca and Merida, and goes\r\nnorth-east through New Grenada to the 10th northern parallel, where it\r\njoins the coast-chain of Venezuela or Caraccas, which runs due east, and\r\nends at Cape Paria in the Caribbean Sea, or rather at the eastern\r\nextremity of the island of Trinidad. This coast-chain is so majestic and\r\nbeautiful that Baron Humboldt says it is like the Alps rising out of the\r\nsea without their snow. The insulated group of Santa Martha, 19,000 feet\r\nhigh, deeply covered with snow, stands on an extensive plain between the\r\ndelta of the Magdalena and the sea-lake of Maracaybo, and is a landmark\r\nto mariners far off in the Caribbean Sea.\r\n\r\nThe passes over the Chilian Andes are numerous; that of the Portillo,\r\nleading from St. Jago to Mendoza, is the highest; it crosses two ridges,\r\noffering a valley between, a diminutive representation of the great\r\nPeru-Bolivian depression and of the valley of Quito; the most elevated\r\nis so high that vegetation ceases far below its summit. Those in Peru\r\nare higher, though very few reach the snow-line. In Bolivia the mean\r\nelevation of the passes in the western and eastern Cordillera is 14,892\r\nand 14,422 feet respectively. That leading from Sorata to the auriferous\r\nvalley of Tipauni is perhaps the highest in Bolivia. From the total\r\nabsence of vegetation, and the intense cold, it is supposed to be 16,000\r\nfeet above the Pacific; those to the north are but little lower. The\r\npass of Quindiu in Colombia, though not so high, is the most difficult\r\nof all across the Andes: but those crossing the mountain-knots from one\r\ntable-land to another are the most dangerous; for example, that over the\r\nParamo del Assuay, in the plain of Quito, where the road is nearly as\r\nhigh as Mont Blanc, and travellers not unfrequently perish from cold\r\nwinds in attempting it.[48]\r\n\r\nOn the western side of the Andes little or no rain falls, except at\r\ntheir most southern extremity, and scanty vegetation appears only on\r\nspots or in small valleys, watered by streams from the Andes. Excessive\r\nheat and moisture combine to cover the eastern side and its offsets with\r\ntangled forests of large trees and dense brushwood. This exuberance\r\ndiminishes as the height increases, till at last the barren rocks are\r\ncovered only by snow and glaciers. In the Andes near the equator,\r\nglaciers descending below the snow-line are unknown. The steepness of\r\nthe declivities and the dryness of the air, at such great elevations,\r\nprevent any accumulation of infiltrated water: the annual changes of\r\ntemperature besides are small. Nothing can surpass the desolation of\r\nthese regions, where nature has been shaken by terrific convulsions. The\r\ndazzling snow fatigues the eye; the huge masses of bold rock, the mural\r\nprecipices, and the chasms yawning into dark unknown depths, strike the\r\nimagination; while the crash of the avalanche, or the rolling thunder of\r\nthe volcano, startles the ear. In the dead of night, when the sky is\r\nclear and the wind hushed, the hollow moaning of the volcanic fire fills\r\nthe Indian with superstitious dread in the deathlike stillness of these\r\nsolitudes.\r\n\r\nIn the very elevated plains in the transverse groups, such as that of\r\nBombon, however pure the sky, the landscape is lurid and colourless: the\r\ndark-blue shadows are sharply defined, and from the thinness of the air\r\nit is hardly possible to make a just estimate of distance. Changes of\r\nweather are sudden and violent; clouds of black vapour arise and are\r\ncarried by fierce winds over the barren plains; snow and hail are driven\r\nwith irresistible impetuosity; and thunder-storms come on, loud and\r\nawful, without warning. Notwithstanding the thinness of the air, the\r\ncrash of the peals is quite appalling; while the lightning runs along\r\nthe scorched grass, and, sometimes issuing from the ground, destroys a\r\nteam of mules or a flock of sheep at one flash.[49]\r\n\r\nCurrents of warm air are occasionally met with on the crest of the\r\nAndes—an extraordinary phenomenon on such gelid heights, which is not\r\nyet accounted for: they generally occur two hours after sunset, are\r\nlocal and narrow, not exceeding a few fathoms in width, similar to the\r\nequally partial blasts of hot air in the Alps. A singular instance,\r\nprobably, of earth-light occurs in crossing the Andes from Chile to\r\nMendoza. On this rocky scene a peculiar brightness occasionally rests, a\r\nkind of undescribable reddish light, which vanishes during the winter\r\nrains, and is not perceptible on sunny days. Dr. Pœppig ascribes the\r\nphenomenon to the dryness of the air: he was confirmed in his opinion\r\nfrom afterwards observing a similar brightness on the coast of Peru, and\r\nit has also been seen in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe Andes descend to the eastern plains by a series of cultivated\r\nlevels, as those of Tucuman, Salta, and Jujuy, in the Republic of La\r\nPlata, with many others. That of Tucuman is 2500 feet above the sea—the\r\ngarden of the republic.\r\n\r\nThe low lands to the east of the Andes are divided by the table-lands\r\nand mountains of Parima and Brazil into three parts of very different\r\naspect—the deserts and pampas of Patagonia and Buenos Ayres, the Silvas\r\nor woody basin of the Amazons, and the Llanos or grassy steppes of the\r\nOrinoco. The eastern table-lands nowhere exceed 2500 feet of absolute\r\nheight; the plains are so low and flat, especially at the foot of the\r\nAndes, that a rise of 1000 feet in the Atlantic Ocean would submerge\r\nmore than half the continent of South America.\r\n\r\nThe system of Parima is a group of mountains scattered over a table-land\r\nnot more than 2000 feet above the sea, which extends 600 or 700 miles\r\nfrom east to west, between the river Orinoco, the Rio Negro, the\r\nAmazons, and the Atlantic Ocean. It is quite unconnected with the Andes,\r\nbeing 80 leagues east from the mountains of New Grenada. It begins 60 or\r\n70 miles from the coast of Venezuela, and ascends by four successive\r\nterraces to undulating plains, which come within one or two degrees of\r\nthe equator, and is twice as long as it is broad.\r\n\r\nSeven chains, besides groups of mountains, cross the table-land from\r\nwest to east, of which the chief is the Sierra del Parima. Beginning at\r\nthe mouth of the Meta, it crosses the plains of Esmeralda to the borders\r\nof Brazil. This chain is not more than 600 feet high, is everywhere\r\nescarped, and forms the watershed between the tributaries of the Amazons\r\nand those of the Orinoco. The Orinoco rises on the northern side of the\r\nSierra del Parima, and in its circuitous course over the plains of\r\nEsmeralda it breaks through that chain and the parallel chain of the\r\nMaypures 37 miles to the south: dashing with violence against the\r\ntransverse shelving rocks and dykes, it forms the magnificent series of\r\nrapids and cataracts of Maypures and Atures, from whence the Parima\r\nmountains have got the name of the Cordillera of the cataracts of the\r\nOrinoco. The chain is of granite, which forms the banks and fills the\r\nbed of the river, covered with luxuriant tropical vegetation, especially\r\npalm-forests. In the district of the Upper Orinoco, near Charichana,\r\nthere is a granite rock which emits musical sounds at sunrise, like the\r\nnotes of an organ, occasioned by the difference of temperature of the\r\nexternal air and that which fills the deep narrow crevices with which\r\nthe rock is everywhere torn. Something of the same kind occurs at Mount\r\nSinai.[50]\r\n\r\nThe other parallel chains that extend over the table-land in Venezuela\r\nand Guiana, though not of great height, are very rugged and often\r\ncrowned with mural ridges; they are separated by flat savannahs,\r\ngenerally barren in the dry season, but after the rains covered with a\r\ncarpet of emerald-green grass, often six feet high, mixed with flowers.\r\nThe vegetation in these countries is beautiful beyond imagination: the\r\nregions of the Upper Orinoco and Rio Negro, and of almost all the\r\nmountains and banks of rivers in Guiana, are clothed with majestic and\r\nimpenetrable forests, whose moist and hot recesses are the abode of the\r\nsingular and beautiful race of the Orchideæ and tangled creepers of many\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nAlthough all the mountains of the system of Parima are wild and rugged,\r\nthey are not high; the inaccessible peak of the Cerro Duida, which rises\r\ninsulated 7155 feet above the plain of Esmeralda, is the culminating\r\npoint, and one of the highest mountains in South America east of the\r\nAndes. The fine savannahs of the Rupununi were the country of romance in\r\nthe days of Queen Elizabeth. South of Pacaraime, near an inlet of the\r\nriver, the far-famed city of Manoa was supposed to stand, the object of\r\nthe unfortunate expedition of Sir Walter Raleigh; about 11 miles\r\nsouth-west of which is situated the lake Amucu, “the Great Lake with\r\ngolden banks,”—great only during the periodical floods.[51]\r\n\r\nOn the southern side of the basin of the river Amazons lies the\r\ntable-land of Brazil, nowhere more than 2500 feet high, which occupies\r\nhalf that empire, together with part of the Argentine republic and\r\nUruguay Orientale. Its form is a triangle, whose apex is at the\r\nconfluence of the rivers Mamore and Beni, and its base extends, near the\r\nshore of the Atlantic, from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata to within\r\nthree degrees of the equator. It is difficult to define the limits of\r\nthis vast territory, but some idea may be formed of it by following the\r\ndirection of the rapids and cataracts of the rivers descending from it\r\nto the plains around. Thus, a line drawn from the fall of the river of\r\nthe Tocantins, in 3° 30ʹ S. latitude, to the cataracts of the Madeira,\r\nin the eighth degree of south latitude, will nearly mark its northern\r\nboundary; from thence the line would run S.W. to the junction of the\r\nMamore and Beni; then turning to the S.E. along the ridges of mountains\r\ncalled the Cordillera Geral, and Sierra Parecis, it would proceed south\r\nto the cataract of the Paraná, called the Sete Quedas, in 24° 30ʹ S.\r\nlat.; and lastly from thence, by the great falls of the river Iguassu,\r\nto the Morro de Santa Martha, in lat. 28° 40ʹ, south of the island of\r\nSt. Catherine.\r\n\r\nChains of mountains, nearly parallel, extend from south-west to\r\nnorth-east, 700 miles along the base of the triangle, with a breadth of\r\nabout 400 miles. Of these, the Sierra de Mar, or the “coast-chain,”\r\nreaches from the river Uruguay to Cape San Roque, never more distant\r\nthan 20 miles from the Atlantic, except to the south of the bay of\r\nSantos, where it is 80. Offsets diverge to the right and left; the\r\ngranitic peaks of the Corcovado and Tejuco, which form such picturesque\r\nobjects in that most magnificent of panoramas the bay of Rio de Janeiro,\r\nare the ends of one. The parallel chain of Espenhaço, beginning near the\r\ntown of San Paolo, and the continuous chains of the Serro Frio, and\r\nforming the western boundary of the basin of the Rio San Francisco, is\r\nthe highest in Brazil, one of its mountains, Itambe, being 8426 feet\r\nabove the sea. All the mountains in Brazil have a general tendency from\r\nS.W. to N.E., except the transverse chain of the Sierra dos Vertentes,\r\nwhich begins 60 miles south of Villa Rica, and runs in a tortuous line\r\nto its termination near the junction of the Mamore and Beni. It forms\r\nthe watershed of the tributaries of the San Francisco and Amazons on the\r\nnorth, and those of the Rio de la Plata on the south; its greatest\r\nheight is 3500 feet above the sea: its western part, the Sierra Parecis,\r\nis merely a succession of detached hills. This chain, the coast-chain of\r\nVenezuela, and the mountains of Parima, are the only ranges in the\r\ncontinent of America that do not entirely, or in some degree, lie in the\r\ndirection of the meridians.\r\n\r\nMagnificent forests of tall trees, bound together by tangled creeping\r\nand parasitical plants, clothe the declivities of the mountains and line\r\nthe borders of the Brazilian rivers, where the soil is rich and the\r\nverdure brilliant. Many of the plains on the table-land bear a coarse\r\nnutritious grass after the rains only, others forests of dwarf trees;\r\nbut vast undulating tracts are always verdant with excellent pasture\r\nintermixed with fields of corn: some parts are bare sand and rolled\r\nquartz, and the Campos Parecis, north of the Sierre dos Vertentes, in\r\nthe province of Matto Grosso, is a sandy desert of unknown extent,\r\nsimilar to the Great Gobi on the table-land of Tibet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nThe Low Lands of South America—Desert of Patagonia—The Pampas of Buenos\r\n  Ayres—The Silvas of the Amazons—The Llanos of the Orinoco and\r\n  Venezuela—Geological Notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE southern plains are the most barren of the three great tracts of\r\nAmerican low lands; they stretch from Tierra del Fuego over 27 degrees\r\nof latitude, or 1900 miles, nearly to Tucuman and the mountains of\r\nBrazil. Palms grow at one end, deep snow covers the other many months in\r\nthe year. This enormous plain, of 1,620,000 square miles, begins on the\r\neastern part of Tierra del Fuego, which is a flat covered with trees,\r\nand therefore superior to its continuation on the continent through\r\neastern Patagonia, which, for 800 miles from the land’s end to beyond\r\nthe Rio Colorado, is a desert of shingle.[52] It is occasionally\r\ndiversified by huge boulders, tufts of brown grass, low bushes armed\r\nwith spines, brine-lakes, incrustations of salt, white as snow, and by\r\nblack basaltic platforms, like plains of iron, at the foot of the Andes,\r\nbarren as the rest. Eastern Patagonia, however, is not one universal\r\nflat, but a succession of shingly horizontal plains at higher and higher\r\nlevels, separated by long lines of cliffs or escarpments, the gable ends\r\nof the tiers or plains. The ascent is small, for even at the foot of the\r\nAndes the highest of these platforms is only 3000 feet above the ocean.\r\nThe plains are here and there intersected by a ravine or a stream, the\r\nwaters of which do not fertilize the blighted soil. The transition from\r\nintense heat to intense cold is rapid, and piercing winds often rush in\r\nhurricanes over these deserts, shunned even by the Indian, except when\r\nhe crosses them to visit the tombs of his fathers. The shingle ends a\r\nfew miles to the north of the Rio Colorado: there the red calcareous\r\nearth of the Pampas begins, monotonously covered with coarse tufted\r\ngrass, without a tree or bush. This country, nearly as level as the sea\r\nand without a stone, extends almost to the table-land of Brazil, and for\r\n1000 miles between the Atlantic and the Andes, interrupted only at vast\r\ndistances by a solitary umbú, the only tree of this soil, rising like a\r\ngreat landmark. This wide space, though almost destitute of water, is\r\nnot all of the same description. In the Pampas of Buenos Ayres there are\r\nfour distinct regions. For 180 miles west from Buenos Ayres they are\r\ncovered with thistles and lucern of the most vivid green so long as the\r\nmoisture from the rain lasts. In spring the verdure fades, and a month\r\nafterwards the thistles shoot up 10 feet high, so dense and so protected\r\nby spines that they are impenetrable. During the summer the dried stalks\r\nare broken by the wind, and the lucern again spreads freshness over the\r\nground. The Pampas for 430 miles west of this region is a thicket of\r\nlong tufted luxuriant grass, intermixed with gaudy flowers, affording\r\ninexhaustible pasture to thousands of horses and cattle; this is\r\nfollowed by a tract of swamps and bogs, to which succeeds a region of\r\nravines and stones, and, lastly, a zone, reaching to the Andes, of\r\nthorny bushes and dwarf trees in one dense thicket. The flat plains in\r\nEntre Rios in Uruguay, those of Santa Fé, and a great part of Cordova\r\nand Tucuman, are of sward, with cattle-farms. The banks of the Paraná,\r\nand other tributaries of the La Plata, are adorned with an infinite\r\nvariety of tropical productions, especially the graceful tribe of palms;\r\nand the river islands are bright with orange-groves. A desert of sand,\r\ncalled El Gran Chaco, exists west of the Paraguay, the vegetable produce\r\nof which is confined to a variety of the aloe and cactus tribes.\r\nAdjoining this desert are the Bolivian provinces of Chiquitos and Moxos,\r\ncovered with forests and jungle, the scene of the most laborious and\r\nbenificent exertions of the Jesuit Missionaries towards the civilization\r\nof the aborigines of South America in the last century.\r\n\r\nThe Pampas of Buenos Ayres, 1000 feet above the sea, sink to a low level\r\nalong the foot of the Andes, where the streams from the mountains\r\ncollect in large lakes, swamps, lagoons of prodigious size, and\r\nwide-spreading salines. The swamp or lagoon of Ybera, of 1000 square\r\nmiles, is entirely covered with aquatic plants. These swamps are swollen\r\nto thousands of square miles by the annual floods of the rivers, which\r\nalso inundate the Pampas, leaving a fertilizing coat of mud. Multitudes\r\nof animals perish in the floods, and the drought that sometimes succeeds\r\nis more fatal. Between the years 1830 and 1832 two millions of cattle\r\ndied from want of food. Millions of animals are sometimes destroyed by\r\ncasual and dreadful conflagrations in these countries when covered with\r\ndry grass and thistles.[53]\r\n\r\nThe Silvas of the river of the Amazons, lying in the centre of the\r\ncontinent, form the second division of the South American low lands.\r\nThis country is more uneven than the Pampas, and the vegetation is so\r\ndense that it can only be penetrated by sailing up the river or its\r\ntributaries. The forests not only cover the basin of the Amazons from\r\nthe Cordillera of Chiquitos to the mountains of Parima, but also its\r\nlimiting mountain-chains, the Sierra dos Vertentes and Parima, so that\r\nthe whole forms an area of woodland more than six times the size of\r\nFrance, lying between the 18th parallel of south latitude and the 7th of\r\nnorth; consequently inter-tropical and traversed by the equator. There\r\nare some marshy savannahs between the 3d and 4th degrees of north\r\nlatitude, and some grassy steppes south of the Pacaraimo chain; but they\r\nare insignificant compared with the Silvas, which extend 1500 miles\r\nalong the river, varying in breadth from 350 to 800 miles, and probably\r\nmore. According to Baron Humboldt, the soil, enriched for ages by the\r\nspoils of the forest, consists of the richest mould. The heat is\r\nsuffocating in the deep and dark recesses of these primeval woods, where\r\nnot a breath of air penetrates, and where, after being drenched by the\r\nperiodical rains, the damp is so excessive that a blue mist rises in the\r\nearly morning among the huge stems of the trees, and envelops the\r\nentangled creepers stretching from bough to bough. A death-like\r\nstillness prevails from sunrise to sunset, then the thousands of animals\r\nthat inhabit these forests join in one loud discordant roar, not\r\ncontinuous, but in bursts. The beasts seem to be periodically and\r\nunanimously roused by some unknown impulse, till the forest rings in\r\nuniversal uproar. Profound silence prevails at midnight, which is broken\r\nat the dawn of morning by another general roar of the wild chorus.\r\nNightingales too have their fits of silence and song; after a pause they\r\n\r\n               “—— all burst forth in choral minstrelsy,\r\n               As if some sudden gale had swept at once\r\n               A hundred airy harps.” _Coleridge._\r\n\r\nThe whole forest often resounds when the animals, startled from their\r\nsleep, scream in terror at the noise made by bands of its inhabitants\r\nflying from some night-prowling foe. Their anxiety and terror before a\r\nthunder-storm is excessive, and all nature seems to partake in the\r\ndread. The tops of the lofty trees rustle ominously, though not a breath\r\nof air agitates them; a hollow whistling in the high regions of the\r\natmosphere comes as a warning from the black floating vapour; midnight\r\ndarkness envelops the ancient forests, which soon after groan and creak\r\nwith the blast of the hurricane. The gloom is rendered still more\r\nhideous by the vivid lightning and the stunning crash of thunder. Even\r\nfishes are affected with the general consternation; for in a few minutes\r\nthe Amazons rages in waves like a stormy sea.\r\n\r\nThe Llanos of the Orinoco and Venezuela, covered with long grass, form\r\nthe third department of South American low lands, and occupy 153,000\r\nsquare miles between the deltas of the Orinoco and the river Coqueta,\r\nflat as the surface of the sea. It is possible to travel over these flat\r\nplains for 1100 miles from the delta of the Orinoco to the foot of the\r\nAndes of Pasto; frequently there is not an eminence a foot high in 270\r\nsquare miles. They are twice as long as they are broad; and as the wind\r\nblows constantly from the east, the climate is the more ardent the\r\nfarther west. These steppes for the most part are destitute of trees or\r\nbushes, yet in some places they are dotted with the mauritia and other\r\npalm-trees. Flat as these plains are, there are in some places two kinds\r\nof inequalities; one consists of banks or shoals of grit or compact\r\nlimestone, five or six feet high, perfectly level for several leagues,\r\nand imperceptible except on their edges: the other inequality can only\r\nbe detected by the barometer or levelling instruments; it is called a\r\nMesa, and is an eminence rising imperceptibly to the height of some\r\nfathoms. Small as the elevation is, a mesa forms the watershed from S.W.\r\nto N.E., between the affluents of the Orinoco and the streams flowing to\r\nthe northern coast of Terra Firma. In the wet season, from April to the\r\nend of October, the tropical rains pour down in torrents, and hundreds\r\nof square miles of the Llanos are inundated by the floods of the rivers.\r\nThe water is sometimes 12 feet deep in the hollows, in which so many\r\nhorses and other animals perish, that the ground smells of musk, an\r\nodour peculiar to many South American quadrupeds. From the flatness of\r\nthe country too, the waters of some affluents of the Orinoco are driven\r\nbackwards by the floods of that river, especially when aided by the\r\nwind, and form temporary lakes. When the waters subside, these steppes,\r\nmanured by the sediment, are mantled with verdure, and produce ananas,\r\nwith occasional groups of fan palm-trees, and mimosas skirt the rivers.\r\nWhen the dry weather returns, the grass is burnt to powder; the air is\r\nfilled with dust raised by currents occasioned by difference of\r\ntemperature, even where there is no wind. If by any accident a spark of\r\nfire falls on the scorched plains, a conflagration spreads from river to\r\nriver, destroying every animal, and leaves the clayey soil sterile for\r\nyears, till vicissitudes of weather crumble the brick-like surface into\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe Llanos lie between the equator and the Tropic of Cancer; the mean\r\nannual temperature is about 84° of Fahrenheit. The heat is most intense\r\nduring the rainy season, when tremendous thunder-storms are of common\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GEOLOGY OF SOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable circumstance in the geological features of the South\r\nAmerican continent is the vast development of volcanic force, which is\r\nconfined to the chain of the Andes, and where it has acquired a\r\nconsiderable breadth, as in the Peru-Bolivian portion, to the part\r\nnearest the sea-coast. It would be wrong, however, to say that there are\r\nno traces of modern volcanic action at a great distance from the\r\nsea:[54] it is one of those theories which recent discoveries in both\r\ncontinents have proved the fallacy of. The volcanic vents occur in the\r\nAndes in linear groups: the most southern of these is that of Chile,\r\nextending from the latitude of Chiloe to that of Santiago, 42° to 33°\r\nS.: in this space exist five well-authenticated craters in ignition—the\r\nmost southern is the volcano of Llanquihae or Osorno, observed by M.\r\nGaye, and the most northern that of Maypu, the fires of which are\r\nsometimes seen from the capital of Chile. Between the 32d parallel and\r\nthe Bolivian frontier there does not appear to be a single volcanic\r\nvent, but in the province of Atacama rises the volcano of San Pedro of\r\nAtacama. The mountain of Isluga, in the province of Tarapaca, is said to\r\nbe an active volcano, but the great centre of volcanic action in this\r\npart of the Western Cordillera extends from 18° 10ʹ to 16° 20ʹ, where\r\nthe Andes have changed their direction from being parallel to the\r\nmeridian to one inclined nearly 45 degrees to that line. The trachytic\r\ngiant domes of the Andes, Sahama, and the Nevado of Chuquibamba mark the\r\nN. and S. limits of this line of vents: the former, one of the most\r\nperfect trachytic pyramids in the Andes, rises to a height of 22,350\r\nfeet, in lat. 18° 7ʹ and long. 68° 54ʹ W.; near to it are the twin\r\nNevados of Pomarape and Parinacota, one of which appears to emit smoke.\r\nThe group of snowy peaks seen from Arica, the centre of which, the\r\nNevado of Tacora, is in lat. 17° 43ʹ, offers a broken-down crater, and\r\nan active solfaterra, on one of its sides. Between this point and the\r\nvolcano of Arequipa no active volcano has been observed. It is well\r\nknown that the latter has vomited flames and ashes, and spread\r\ndesolation around, at a comparatively recent period; the crater of\r\nUvinas, active in the 16th century, is now filled up and completely\r\nextinct. Between the latitude of Arequipa (16° 24ʹ) and the Equatorial\r\ngroup of volcanos, the Andes do not present a single active crater. This\r\nEquatorial group extends over a meridional line of 3-1/4 degrees—between\r\nthe Peak of Sangay and the volcano of Los Pastos. The most remarkable of\r\nthese volcanic vents are the Sangay, Tunguragua, and Cotopaxi, all\r\nsituated in the Cordillera most remote from the ocean. Pichincha burned\r\nas recently as 1831; and north of the Equator, Imbaburu, the volcanos of\r\nChiles, of Cumbal, of Tuqueres or Los Pastos, of Sotara and Purace, mark\r\nthe extension of actual volcanic action into our hemisphere.\r\n\r\nGranite, which seems to be the base of the whole continent, is widely\r\nspread to the east and south: it appears in Tierra del Fuego and in the\r\nPatagonian Andes abundantly, and at great elevations, and in Chile and\r\nsouthern Peru forms the line of hills parallel to the Pacific, and where\r\nare situated the mineral riches of the former republic; but it comes\r\ninto view so rarely in the northern parts of the chain, that Baron\r\nHumboldt says a person might travel years in the Andes of Peru and Quito\r\nwithout falling in with it. He never saw it at a greater height above\r\nthe sea than 11,500 feet. Gneiss is here and there associated with the\r\ngranite, but micaschist is by much the most common of the crystalline\r\nrocks. Quartz rock, probably of the Devonian period, is much developed,\r\ngenerally mixed with mica, and rich in gold and specular iron. It\r\nsometimes extends several leagues in the western declivities of Peru\r\n6000 feet thick. Red sandstone, with its gypseous and saliferous marls,\r\nof the age of our English red marl, of vast dimensions, occurs in the\r\nAndes, and on the table-land east of them, where, in some places, as in\r\nColombia, it spreads over thousands of square miles to the shores of the\r\nAtlantic. It is widely extended at altitudes of 10,000 and 12,000 feet—\r\nfor example, on the plains of Tarqui and in the valley of Cuença. Coal\r\nis sometimes associated with it, and is found in the Andes of Pasco, in\r\nPeru, 14,750 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nPorphyry abounds all over the Andes, from Patagonia to Colombia, at\r\nevery elevation, on the slopes and summits of the mountains rising to\r\nthe greatest elevation, but of very different ages and mineralogical\r\ncharacters. One variety which frequently occurs is rich in metals, and\r\nhence has been designated as _metalliferous_: in it are situated some of\r\nthe most celebrated silver mines of Peru, those of Potosi, Oruro, Puno.\r\nThe bare and precipitous porphyry-rocks give great variety to the\r\ncolouring of the Andes, especially in Chile, where purple, tile-red, and\r\nbrown are contrasted with the snow on the summit of the chain.[55]\r\n\r\nTrachyte is almost as abundant as porphyry; many of the loftiest parts,\r\nand all the great dome-shaped mountains, are formed of it. Masses of\r\nthis rock, from 14,000 to 18,000 feet thick, are seen on Chimborazo and\r\nPichincha. Prodigious quantities of volcanic products, lava, tufa, and\r\nobsidian, occur on the western face of the Andes, where volcanos are\r\nactive. On the eastern side there are none. This is especially the case\r\nin that part of the chain lying between the equator and Chile. The\r\nBolivian Cordilleras, which encircle the valley of Desaguadero, furnish\r\na striking example. The Cordillera of the coast is composed of\r\ncrystalline and stratified rocks at its base, and of trachytes,\r\nobsidian, and trachytic conglomerates at greater elevations, while the\r\neastern Cordillera consists of stratified rocks of the Silurian system,\r\nwith granites, quartziferous porphyries, and syenites injected, and of\r\nsecondary rocks of the triassic period, and marls, containing gypsum,\r\noolitic limestone, and rock-salt of the most beautiful colours. Towards\r\nChile, and throughout the Chilian range, the case is different, because\r\nactive volcanos are there in the centre of the chain.\r\n\r\nSea-shells of different geological periods are found at various\r\nelevations, which shows that many upheavings and subsidences have taken\r\nplace in the chain of the Andes.[56] The whole range, after twice\r\nsubsiding some thousand feet, was brought up by a slow movement in mass\r\nduring the Eiocene period, after which it sank down once more several\r\nhundred feet, to be again uplifted to its present level by a slow and\r\noften interrupted motion. These vicissitudes are very perceptible,\r\nespecially at its southern extremity. Stems of large trees, which Mr.\r\nDarwin found in a fossil state in the Uspallata range, on the eastern\r\ndeclivity of the Chilian Andes, now 700 miles distant from the Atlantic,\r\nexhibit a remarkable example of such vicissitudes. These trees, with the\r\nvolcanic soil on which they had grown, had sunk from the beach to the\r\nbottom of a deep ocean, from which, after five alternations of\r\nsedimentary deposits and deluges of submarine lava of prodigious\r\nthickness, the whole mass was raised up, and now forms the Uspallata\r\nchain. Subsequently, by the wearing of streams, the embedded trunks have\r\nbeen brought into view in a silicified state, projecting from the soil\r\nin which they grew—now solid rock.\r\n\r\n“Vast and scarcely comprehensible as such changes must ever appear, yet\r\nthey have all occurred within a period recent when compared with the\r\nhistory of the Cordillera; and the Cordillera itself is absolutely\r\nmodern compared with many of the fossiliferous strata of Europe and\r\nAmerica.”[57]\r\n\r\nFrom the quantity of shingle and sand in the valleys in the lower\r\nridges, as well as at altitudes from 7000 to 9000 feet above the present\r\nlevel of the sea, it appears that the whole area of the Chilian Andes\r\nhas been rising for centuries by a gradual motion; and the coast is now\r\nrising by the same imperceptible degrees, though it is sometimes\r\nsuddenly elevated by a succession of small upheavings of a few feet by\r\nearthquakes, similar to that which shook the continent for 1000 miles on\r\nthe 20th of February, 1835.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the Andes the land from Tierra del Fuego to the\r\nRio de la Plata has been raised _en masse_ by one great elevating force,\r\nacting equally and imperceptibly for 2000 miles, within the period of\r\nthe shell-fish now existing, which, in many parts of these plains, even\r\nstill retain their colours. The gradual upward movement was interrupted\r\nby at least eight long periods of rest, marked by the edges of the\r\nsuccessive plains, which, extending from south to north, had formed so\r\nmany lines of sea-coast, as they rose higher and higher between the\r\nAtlantic and the Andes. It appears, from the shingle and fossil shells\r\nfound on both sides of the Cordillera, that the whole south-western\r\nextremity of the continent has been rising slowly for a long time, and\r\nindeed the whole Andean chain. The rise on the coast of Chile has been\r\nat the rate of several feet in a century; but it has diminished\r\neastward, till, in the Patagonian plains and Pampas, it has been only a\r\nfew inches in the same line.\r\n\r\nThe instability of the southern part of the continent is less\r\nastonishing, if it be considered that at the time of the earthquake of\r\n1835 the volcanos in the Chilian Andes were in eruption\r\ncontemporaneously for 720 miles in one direction and 400 in another, so\r\nthat in all probability there was a subterranean lake of burning lava\r\nbelow this end of the continent twice as large as the Black Sea.[58]\r\n\r\nThe terraced plains of Patagonia, which extend hundreds of miles along\r\nthe coast, are tertiary strata, not in basins, but in one great deposit,\r\nabove which lies a thick stratum of a white pumaceous substance,\r\nextending at least 500 miles, a tenth part of which consists of marine\r\ninfusoria. Over the whole lies the shingle already mentioned, spread\r\nover the coast for 700 miles in length, with a mean breadth of 200\r\nmiles, and 50 feet thick. These myriads of pebbles, chiefly of porphyry,\r\nhave been torn from the rocks of the Andes, and water-worn, at a period\r\nsubsequent to the deposition of the tertiary strata—a period of\r\nincalculable duration. All the plains of Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia,\r\non both sides of the Andes, are strewed with huge boulders, which have\r\nbeen supposed to have been transported by icebergs which had descended\r\nto lower latitudes in ancient times than they do now—observations of\r\ngreat interest, which we owe to Mr. Darwin.\r\n\r\nThe stunted vegetation of these sterile plains was sufficient to nourish\r\nlarge animals of the pachydermata tribe, now extinct, even at a period\r\nwhen the present shell-fish of the Patagonian seas existed.\r\n\r\nThe Pampas of Buenos Ayres are entirely alluvial, the deposit of the Rio\r\nde la Plata. Granite prevails to the extent of 2000 miles along the\r\ncoast of Brazil, and with syenite forms the base of the table-land. The\r\nsuperstructure of the latter consists of metamorphic and old igneous\r\nrocks, sandstone, clay-slate, limestone, in which are large caverns with\r\nbones of extinct animals, and alluvial soil. Gold is found in the\r\nalluvial soil on the banks of the rivers, and diamonds, so abundant in\r\nthat country, in a ferruginous conglomerate of a very recent period.\r\n\r\nThe fertile soil of the Silvas has travelled from afar: washed down from\r\nthe Andes, it has been gradually deposited, and manured by the decay of\r\na thousand forests. Granite again appears, in more than its usual\r\nruggedness, in the table-land and mountains of the Parima system. The\r\nsandstone of the Andes is found there also; and on the plains of\r\nEsmeralda it caps the granite of the solitary prism-shaped Duida, the\r\nculminating mountain of the Parima system. Limestone appears in the\r\nBrigantine or Cocollar, the most southern of the three ranges of the\r\ncoast-chain of Venezuela; the other two are of granite, metamorphic\r\nrocks, and crystalline schists, torn by earthquakes and worn by the sea,\r\nwhich has deeply indented that coast. The chain of islands in the\r\nSpanish main is merely the wreck of a more northern ridge, broken up\r\ninto detached masses by these irresistible powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCentral America—West Indian Islands—Geological Notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAKING the natural divisions of the continent alone into consideration,\r\nCentral America may be regarded as lying between the Isthmus of Panamá\r\nand Darien and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and consequently in a\r\ntropical climate. This narrow tortuous strip of land, which unites the\r\ncontinents of North and South America, stretches from S.E. to N.W. about\r\n1200 miles, varying in breadth from 20 to 300 or 400 miles.\r\n\r\nAs a regular chain, the Andes descend suddenly at the Isthmus of Panamá,\r\nbut as a mass of high land they continue through Central America and\r\nMexico, in an irregular mixture of table-lands and mountains. The mass\r\nof high land which forms the central ridge of the country, and the\r\nwatershed between the two oceans, is very steep on its western side, and\r\nruns near the coast of the Pacific, where Central America is narrow; but\r\nto the north, where it becomes wider, the high land recedes to a greater\r\ndistance from the shore than the Andes do in any other part between Cape\r\nHorn and Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis country consists of three distinct groups, divided by valleys which\r\nrun from sea to sea, namely, Costarica, the group of Honduras and\r\nNicaragua, and the group of Guatemala.[59]\r\n\r\nThe plains of Panamá, very little raised above the sea, and in some\r\nparts studded with hills, follow the direction of the isthmus for 280\r\nmiles, and end at the Bay of Parita. From thence the forest-covered\r\nCordillera of Veragua, supposed to be 9000 feet high, extends to the\r\nsmall but elevated table-land of Costarica, surrounded by volcanos, and\r\nterminates at the plain of Nicaragua, which, together with its lake,\r\noccupies an area of 30,000 square miles, and forms the second break in\r\nthe great Andean chain. The lake is only 128 feet above the Pacific,\r\nfrom which it is separated by a line of active volcanos. The river San\r\nJuan de Nicaragua flows from its eastern end into the Caribbean Sea, and\r\nat its northern extremity it is connected with the smaller lake of\r\nManagua or Leon by the river Penaloya. By this water-line it has been\r\nprojected to unite the two seas. The high land begins again, after an\r\ninterval of 170 miles, with the Mosquito country and Honduras, which\r\nmostly consist of table-lands and high mountains, some of which are\r\nvolcanos.\r\n\r\nGuatemala is a table-land intersected by deep valleys, which lies\r\nbetween the plain of Comayagua and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. It\r\nspreads to the east in the peninsula of Yucatan, which terminates at\r\nCape Catoche, and encompasses the Bay of Honduras with terraces of high\r\nmountains. The table-land of Guatemala consists of undulating verdant\r\nplains of great extent, of the absolute height of 5000 feet, fragrant\r\nwith flowers. In the southern part of the table-land the cities of Old\r\nand New Guatemala are situate, 12 miles apart. The portion of the plain\r\non which the new city stands is bounded on the west by the three\r\nvolcanos of Pacayo, del Fuego, and de Agua; these, rising from 7000 to\r\n10,000 feet above the plain, lie close to the new city on the west, and\r\nform a scene of wonderful boldness and beauty. The Volcano de Agua, at\r\nthe foot of which Old Guatemala stands, is a perfect cone, verdant to\r\nits summit, which occasionally pours forth torrents of boiling water and\r\nstones. The old city has been twice destroyed by it, and is now nearly\r\ndeserted on account of earthquakes. The Volcano del Fuego generally\r\nemits smoke from one of its peaks; and the Volcano de Pacayo is only\r\noccasionally active. The wide grassy plains are cut by deep valleys to\r\nthe north, where the high land of Guatemala ends in parallel ridges of\r\nmountains, called the Cerro Pelado, which run from east to west along\r\nthe 94th meridian, filling half the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, which is 140\r\nmiles broad, and unites the table-land of Guatemala with that of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThough there are large savannahs on the high plains of Guatemala, there\r\nare also magnificent primeval forests, as the name of the country\r\nimplies, Guatemala signifying, in the Mexican language, a place covered\r\nwith trees. The banks of the Rio de la Papian, or Usumasinta, which\r\nrises in the alpine lake of Lacandon, and flows over the table-land to\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, are beautiful beyond description.\r\n\r\nThe coasts of Central America are generally narrow, and in some places\r\nthe mountains and high lands come close to the water’s edge. The\r\nsugar-cane is indigenous, and on the low lands of the eastern coast all\r\nthe ordinary produce of the West Indian islands is raised, besides much\r\nthat is peculiar to the country.\r\n\r\nAs the climate is cool on the high lands, the vegetation of the\r\ntemperate zone is there in perfection. On the low lands, as in other\r\ncountries where heat and moisture are in excess, and where nature is for\r\nthe most part undisturbed, vegetation is vigorous to rankness: forests\r\nof gigantic timber seek the foul air above an impenetrable undergrowth,\r\nand the mouths of the rivers are dense masses of jungle with mangroves\r\nand reeds 100 feet high, yet delightful savannahs vary the scene, and\r\nwooded mountains dip into the water.\r\n\r\nNearly all the coast of the Pacific is skirted by an alluvial plain, of\r\nsmall width, and generally very different in character from that on the\r\nAtlantic side. In a line along the western side of the table-land and\r\nthe mountains there is a continued succession of volcanos, at various\r\ndistances from the shore, and at various heights, on the declivity of\r\nthe table-land. It seems as if a great crack or fissure had been\r\nproduced in the earth’s surface, along the junction of the mountains and\r\nthe shore, through which the internal fire had found a vent. There are\r\nmore than 20 active volcanoes in succession between the 10th and 20th\r\nparallels of north latitude; some higher than the mountains of the\r\ncentral ridge, and several subject to violent eruptions. Altogether,\r\nthere are 39 in Central America, 17 of which are in Guatemala—a greater\r\nnumber than in any other country, Java excepted.\r\n\r\nThe Colombian Archipelago, or West Indian Islands, which may be regarded\r\nas the wreck of a submerged part of the continent of South and Central\r\nAmerica, consists of three distinct groups, namely, the Lesser Antillas\r\nor Caribbean Islands, the Greater Antillas, and the Bahama or Lucay\r\nIslands. Some of the Lesser Antillas are flat, but their general\r\ncharacter is bold, with a single mountain or group of mountains in the\r\ncentre, which slopes to the sea all around, more precipitously on the\r\neastern side, which is exposed to the force of the Atlantic current.\r\nTrinidad is the most southerly of a line of magnificent islands, which\r\nform a semi-circle, enclosing the Caribbean Sea, with its convexity\r\nfacing the east. The row is single to the island of Gaudeloupe, where it\r\nsplits into two chains, known as the Windward and Leeward Islands.\r\nTrinidad, Tobago, St. Lucia, and Dominica are particularly mountainous,\r\nand the mountains are cut by deep narrow ravines, or gullies, covered by\r\nancient forests. The volcanic islands, which are mostly in the single\r\npart of the chain, have conical mountains bristled with rocks of a still\r\nmore rugged form; but almost all the islands of the Lesser Antillas have\r\na large portion of excellent vegetable soil in a high state of\r\ncultivation. Most of them are surrounded by coral reefs, which render\r\nnavigation dangerous, and there is little intercourse between these\r\nislands, and still less with the Greater Antillas, on account of the\r\nprevailing winds and currents, which make it difficult to return. The\r\nLesser Antillas terminate with the group of the Virgin Islands, which\r\nare small and flat, some only a few feet above the sea, and most of them\r\nare mere coral rocks.\r\n\r\nThe four islands which form the group of the Greater Antillas are the\r\nlargest and finest in the Archipelago. Porto Rico, Haiti or San Domingo,\r\nand Jamaica, separated from the Virgin Islands by a narrow channel, lie\r\nin a line parallel to the coast-chain of Venezuela, from east to west;\r\nwhile Cuba, by a serpentine bend, separates the Caribbean Sea, or Sea of\r\nthe Antillas, from the Gulf of Mexico. Porto Rico is 90 miles long and\r\n36 broad, with wooded mountains passing through its centre nearly from\r\neast to west, which furnish abundance of water. There are extensive\r\nsavannahs in the interior, and very rich soil on the northern coast, but\r\nthe climate near the sea is unhealthy.\r\n\r\nHaiti or San Domingo, 340 miles long and 132 broad, has a chain of\r\nmountains in its centre, extending from east to west like all the\r\nmountains in the Greater Antillas, the highest point of which is 9000\r\nfeet above the sea. A branch diverges from the main stem to Cape\r\nTiburon, so that Haiti contains a great proportion of high land. The\r\nmountains are susceptible of cultivation nearly to the summit, and are\r\nclothed with undisturbed tropical forests. The extensive plains are well\r\nwatered, and the soil, though not deep, is productive.\r\n\r\nJamaica, the most valuable of the British possessions in the West\r\nIndies, has an area of 4256 square miles, of which 110,000 acres are\r\ncultivated, chiefly as sugar-plantations. The principal chain of the\r\nBlue Mountains lies in the centre of the island, from east to west, with\r\nso sharp a crest that in some places it is only four yards across. The\r\noffsets from it cover all the eastern part of the island; some of them\r\nare very high. The more elevated ridges are flanked by lower ranges,\r\ndescending to verdant savannahs. The escarpments are wild, the\r\ndeclivities steep, and mingled with stately forests. The valleys are\r\nvery narrow, and not more than a twentieth part of the island is level\r\nground. There are many small rivers, and the coast-line is 500 miles\r\nlong, with at least 30 good harbours. The mean summer-heat is 80° of\r\nFahrenheit, and that of winter is 75°. The plains are often unhealthy,\r\nbut the air in the mountains is salubrious; fever has never prevailed at\r\nthe elevation of 2500 feet.\r\n\r\nCuba, the largest island in the Colombian Archipelago, has an area of\r\n3615 square leagues, and 200 miles of coast, but so beset with coral\r\nreefs, sandbanks, and rocks, that only a third of it is accessible. Its\r\nmountains, which attain the height of 8000 feet, occupy the centre and\r\nfill the eastern part of the island, in a great longitudinal line. No\r\nisland in these seas is more important with regard to situation and\r\nnatural productions; and although much of the low ground is swampy and\r\nunhealthy, there are vast savannahs, and about a seventh part of the\r\nisland is cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe Bahama Islands are the least valuable and least interesting part of\r\nthe Archipelago. The group consists of about 500 islands, many of them\r\nmere rocks, lying east of Cuba and the coast of Florida. Twelve are\r\nrather large, and are cultivated; and though arid, they produce Campeche\r\nor log-wood and mahogany. The most intricate labyrinth of shoals and\r\nreefs, chiefly of corals, madrepores, and sand, encompass these islands;\r\nsome of them rise to the surface, and are adorned with groves of\r\npalm-trees. The Great Bahama is the first part of the New World on which\r\nColumbus landed—the next was Haiti, where his ashes rest.\r\n\r\nThe geology of Central America is little known; nevertheless it appears,\r\nfrom the confused mixture of table-lands and mountain-chains in all\r\ndirections, that the subterraneous forces must have acted more partially\r\nand irregularly than either in South or North America. Granite, gneiss,\r\nand mica-slate form the substrata of the country; but the abundance of\r\nigneous rocks bears witness to strong volcanic action, both in ancient\r\nand in modern times, which still maintains its activity in the volcanic\r\ngroups of Guatemala and Mexico.\r\n\r\nFrom the identity of the fossil remains of extinct quadrupeds, there is\r\nevery reason to believe that the West Indian Archipelago was once part\r\nof South America, and that the rugged and tortuous isthmus of Central\r\nAmerica, and the serpentine chain of islands winding from Cumana to the\r\npeninsula of Florida, are but the shattered remains of an unbroken\r\ncontinent. The powerful volcanic action in Central America and Mexico,\r\nthe volcanic nature of many of the West Indian islands, and the\r\nstill-existing fire in St. Vincent’s, together with the tremendous\r\nearthquakes to which the whole region is subject, render it more than\r\nprobable that the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico are one great\r\narea of subsidence, which possibly has been increased by the erosion of\r\nthe Gulf-stream and ground-swell—a temporary current of great\r\nimpetuosity, common among the West Indian islands from October to May.\r\n\r\nThe subsidence of this extensive area must have been very great, since\r\nthe water is of considerable depth between the islands, and it must have\r\ntaken place after the destruction of the great quadrupeds, and\r\nconsequently at a very recent geological period. The elevation of the\r\ntable-land of Mexico may have been a contemporaneous event. In the\r\nColombian Archipelago, volcanic action is confined to the smaller\r\nislands, which, forming a line in a meridional direction, extend from\r\n12° to 18° N., and which may be designated as the Caribbean range: it\r\ncommences with Grenada and ceases with St. Eustatius. St. Vincent, St.\r\nLucia, Martinique, a great portion of Guadaloupe, Montserrat, Nevis, and\r\nSt. Kitts are volcanic; most of them possess craters recently extinct,\r\nwhich have vomited ashes and lava within historical periods; whilst the\r\nless elevated of the Leeward and Windward Islands, Tobago, Barbadoes,\r\nDeseada, Antigua, Barbuda and St. Bartholomew’s, with the Virgin Islands\r\nand Bahamas, are composed either of calcareous or coral rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nNorth America—Table-Land and Mountains of Mexico—The Rocky Mountains—The\r\n  Maritime Chain and Mountains of Russian America.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCORDING to the natural division of the continent, North America begins\r\nabout the 20th degree of north latitude, and terminates in the Arctic\r\nOcean. It is longer than South America, but the irregularity of its\r\noutline renders it impossible to estimate its area. Its greatest length\r\nis about 5100 miles, and its breadth, at the widest part, is 3500 miles.\r\n\r\nThe general structure of North America is still more simple than that of\r\nthe southern part of the continent. The table-lands of Mexico and the\r\nRocky Mountains, which are the continuation of the high land of the\r\nAndes, run along the western side, but at so great a distance from the\r\nPacific as to admit of another system of mountains along the coast. The\r\nimmense plains to the east are divided longitudinally by the Alleghany\r\nMountains, which stretch from the Carolinas to the Gulf of St. Lawrence,\r\nparallel to the Atlantic, and at no great distance from it. Although the\r\ngeneral direction of the mountains is from south to north, yet, as they\r\nmaintain a degree of parallelism to the two coasts, they diverge towards\r\nthe north—one in clinging towards the north-west, and the other towards\r\nthe north-east. The long narrow plain between the Atlantic and the\r\nAlleghanies is divided, throughout its length, by a line of cliffs not\r\nmore than 200 or 300 feet above the Atlantic plain, the out-cropping\r\nedge of the Second Terrace, or Atlantic Slope, whose rolling surface\r\ngoes west to the foot of the mountains.\r\n\r\nAn enormous table-land occupies the greater part of Mexico or Anahuac.\r\nIt begins at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and extends north-west to the\r\n42d parallel of north latitude, a distance of about 1600 miles, which is\r\nnearly equal to the distance from the north extremity of Scotland to\r\nGibraltar. It is narrow towards the south, and expands towards the\r\nnorth-west till about the latitude of the city of Mexico, where it\r\nattains its greatest breadth of 360 miles, and there also it is highest.\r\nThe most easterly part in that parallel is 7500 feet above the sea, from\r\nwhence it extends towards the west, the height being 7430 feet at the\r\ncity of Mexico, and then gradually diminishes to 4000 feet towards the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nIts height in California is not known, but it still bears the character\r\nof a table-land, and maintains an elevation of 6000 feet along the east\r\nside of the Sierra Madre, even to the 32d degree of north latitude,\r\nwhere it sinks to a lower level before joining the Rocky Mountains. The\r\ndescent from this plateau to the low lands is very steep on all sides;\r\non the east, especially, it is so precipitous that, seen from a\r\ndistance, it is like a range of high mountains. There are only two\r\ncarriage-roads to it from the Mexican Gulf, by passes 500 miles asunder—\r\none at Xalapa, near Vera Cruz, the other at Saltillo, west of Monterey.\r\nThe descent to the shores of the Pacific is almost equally rapid, and\r\nthat to the south no less so, where, for 300 miles between the plains of\r\nTehuantepec and the Rio Yopez, it presses on the shores of the Pacific,\r\nand terminates in high mountains, leaving only a narrow margin of hilly\r\nmaritime coast. Where the surface of the table-land is not traversed by\r\nmountains, it is as level as the ocean. There is a carriage-road over it\r\nfor 1500 miles, without hills, from the city of Mexico to Santa Fé.\r\n\r\nThe southern part of the plateau is divided into four parts or distinct\r\nplains, surrounded by hills from 500 to 1000 feet high. In one of these,\r\nthe plain of Tenochtitlan, surrounded by a wall of porphyritic\r\nmountains, stands the city of Mexico, once the capital of the empire of\r\nMontezuma, which must have far surpassed the modern city in extent and\r\nsplendour, as many remains of its ancient glory testify. It is 7430 feet\r\nabove the sea.\r\n\r\nOne of the singular crevices through which the internal fire finds a\r\nvent, stretches from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific, directly across\r\nthe table-land, in a line about 16 miles south of the city of Mexico. A\r\nvery remarkable row of active volcanoes occurs along this parallel;\r\nTuxtla, the most eastern of them, is in the 95th degree of west\r\nlongitude, near the Mexican Gulf, in a low range of wooded hills. More\r\nto the west stands the snow-shrouded cone of Orizaba, with its\r\never-fiery crater, seen like a star in the darkness of the night, which\r\nhas obtained it the name of Cittalapetl—the “Mountain of the Star.”\r\nPopocatepetl, the loftiest mountain in Mexico, 17,884 feet above the\r\nsea, lies still farther west, and is in a state of constant eruption,\r\nwhich, with the peaks of Iztacihuatl and of Toluca, form a kind of\r\nvolcanic circus, in the midst of which the city of Mexico and its lake\r\nare situated. A chain of smaller volcanoes unites the three. On a plain\r\non the western slope of the table-land, and about 70 miles in a straight\r\nline from the Pacific, is the volcanic cone of Jorullo.[60] It suddenly\r\nappeared, and rose 1683 feet above the plain, on the night of the 29th\r\nof September, 1759, and is the highest of six mountains which have been\r\nthrown up on this part of the table-land since the middle of last\r\ncentury. The great cone of Colima, the last of this volcanic series,\r\nstands insulated in the plain of that name, between the western\r\ndeclivity of the table-land and the Pacific.\r\n\r\nA high range of mountains extends along the eastern margin of the\r\ntable-land to the Real de Catorce, and the surface of the plain is\r\ndivided into two parts by the Sierra Madre, which begins at 21° of N.\r\nlat.; and, after running north about 60 miles, its continuity is broken\r\ninto the insulated ridges of the Sierra Altamina, and the group\r\ncontaining the celebrated silver-mines of Fresnillo and Zacatecas; it\r\nsoon after resumes its character of a regular chain, and, with a breadth\r\nof 100 miles, proceeds in parallel ridges and longitudinal valleys to\r\nNew Mexico, where it skirts both banks of the Rio Bravo del Norte, and\r\njoins the Sierra Verde, the most southern part of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nin 40° of N. lat.\r\n\r\nTo the south, some points of the Sierra Madre are said to be 10,000 feet\r\nhigh and 4000 feet above their base; and between the parallels of 36°\r\nand 42°, where the chain is the watershed between the Rio Colorado and\r\nthe Rio Bravo del Norte, they are still higher, and perpetually covered\r\nwith snow. The mountains on the left bank of the last-mentioned river\r\nare the eastern ridges of the Sierra Madre, and contain the sources of\r\nthe innumerable affluents of the Missouri and other rivers that flow\r\ninto the Mississippi and Mexican Gulf.\r\n\r\nDeep cavities, called Barancas, are a characteristic feature of the\r\ntable-lands of Mexico: they are long rents, two or three miles in\r\nbreadth, and many more in length, often descending 1000 feet below the\r\nsurface of the plain, with a brook or the tributary of some river\r\nflowing through them. Their sides are precipitous and rugged, with\r\noverhanging rocks covered with large trees. The intense heat adds to the\r\ncontrast between these hollows and the bare plains, where the air is\r\nmore cool.\r\n\r\nVegetation varies with the elevation; consequently, the splendour which\r\nadorns the low lands vanishes on the high plains, which, though\r\nproducing much grain and pasture, are often saline, sterile, and\r\ntreeless, except in some places where oaks grow to an enormous size,\r\nfree of underwood.\r\n\r\nThe Rocky Mountains run 1500 miles in two parallel chains from the\r\nSierra Verde to the mouth of the Mackenzie river in the Arctic Ocean,\r\nsometimes united by a transverse ridge. In some places the eastern range\r\nrises to the snow-line, and even far above it, as in Mounts Hooper and\r\nBrown; but the general elevation is only above the line of trees. The\r\nwestern range is not so high till north of the 55th parallel, where both\r\nranges are of the same height, and frequently higher than the snow-line.\r\nThey are generally barren, though the transverse valleys have fertile\r\nspots with grass, and sometimes trees. Their only offset in the south is\r\nthe Saba and Ozark mountains, which run through Texas to the\r\nMississippi. The long valley between the two rows of the Rocky\r\nMountains, which is 100 miles wide, must have considerable elevation in\r\nthe south, since the tributaries of the Colombia river descend from it\r\nin a series of rapids and cataracts for nearly 100 miles; and it is\r\nprobably still higher towards the sources of the Peace river, where the\r\nmountains, only 1500 feet above it, are perpetually covered with snow.\r\nThe Sierra Verde is 490 miles from the Pacific, but, as the coast trends\r\ndue north to the Sound of Juan de Fuca, the western range of the Rocky\r\nMountains maintains a distance of 380 miles from the ocean, from that\r\npoint to the latitude of Behring’s Sea, in 60° of N. lat.\r\n\r\nThe mountains on the west coast consist of two chains, one of which,\r\nbeginning in Mexico, about the same latitude with the Sierra Madre,\r\nskirts the Gulf of California on the east, and maintains rather an\r\ninland course till north of the Oregon river, where it forms the Sea\r\nAlps of the coast; and then, increasing in breadth as it passes through\r\nRussian America, it ends at Nootka Sound.\r\n\r\nThe other chain, known as the Sea Alps of California, begins at the\r\nextremity of the peninsula, and, running northward with increasing\r\nheight close to the Pacific, it passes through the island of Quadra and\r\nVancouver, and, after joining the Alps of the north-west coast, it\r\nterminates at Mount St. Elias, which is 17,860 feet high. A range of\r\nvery high snowy mountains, which begins at Cape Mendocino, goes directly\r\nacross both of these coast-chains, and unites them to the Rocky\r\nMountains. It forms the watershed between the Colorado, which goes to\r\nthe Gulf of California, and the affluents of the Oregon or Colombia\r\nriver, which flows into the Pacific, and is continued to the east of the\r\nRocky Mountains, at a less elevation, under the name of the Black\r\nMountains, which stretch to the Missouri. Prairies extend between this\r\ncoast-chain and the Rocky Mountains from California to the north of the\r\nOregon river. The Oregon coast, for 200 miles, is a mass of undisturbed\r\nforest-thickets and marshes; and north from it, with few exceptions, is\r\na mountainous region of bold aspect, often reaching above the snow-line.\r\nA branch of the Sea Alps, which runs westward to Bristol Bay, has many\r\nactive volcanos, and so has that which fills the promontory of Aliaska.\r\n\r\nThe archipelagos and islands along the coast, from California to the\r\npromontory of Aliaska, have the same bold character as the mainland, and\r\nmay be regarded as the tops of a submarine chain of table-land and\r\nmountains which constitute the most westerly ridge of the maritime\r\nchains. Prince of Wales’s Archipelago contains seven active volcanos.\r\n\r\nThe mountains on the coasts of the Pacific and the islands are in many\r\nplaces covered with colossal forests, but wide tracts in the south are\r\nsandy deserts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nNorth America (_continued_)—The Great Central Plains, or Valley of the\r\n  Mississippi—The Alleghany Mountains—The Atlantic Slope—The Atlantic\r\n  Plain—Geological Notice—The Mean Height of the Continents.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE great central plain of North America, lying between the Rocky and\r\nAlleghany Mountains, and reaching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic\r\nOcean, includes the valleys of the Mississippi, St. Lawrence, Nelson,\r\nChurchill, and most of those of the Missouri, Mackenzie, and Coppermine\r\nrivers. It has an area of 3,245,000 square miles, which is 245,000\r\nsquare miles more than the central plain of South America, and about\r\nhalf the size of the great plain of the old continent, which is less\r\nfertile; for although the whole of America is not more than half the\r\nsize of the old continent, it contains at least as much productive soil.\r\n\r\nThe plain, 5000 miles long, becomes wider towards the north, and has no\r\nelevations, except a low table-land which crosses it at the line of the\r\nCanadian lakes and the sources of the Mississippi, and is nowhere above\r\n1500 feet high, and rarely more than 700: it is the watershed between\r\nthe streams that go to the Arctic Ocean and those that flow to the\r\nMississippi. The character of the plain is that of perfect uniformity,\r\nrising by a gentle regular ascent from the Gulf of Mexico to the sources\r\nof the Mississippi, which river is the great feature of the North\r\nAmerican low lands. The ground rises in the same equable manner from the\r\nright bank of the Mississippi to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, but\r\nits ascent from the left bank to the Alleghanies is broken into hill and\r\ndale, containing the most fertile territory in the United States. Under\r\nso wide a range of latitude the plain embraces a great variety of soil,\r\nclimate, and productions; but, being almost in a state of nature, it is\r\ncharacterized in its middle and southern parts by interminable grassy\r\nsavannahs, or prairies, and enormous forests, and in the far north by\r\ndeserts which rival those of Siberia in dreariness.\r\n\r\nIn the south a sandy desert, 400 or 500 miles wide, stretches along the\r\nbase of the Rocky Mountains to the 41st degree of N. lat. The dry plains\r\nof Texas and the upper region of the Arkansas have all the\r\ncharacteristics of Asiatic table-lands; more to the north, the bare\r\ntreeless steppes on the high grounds of the far west are burnt up in\r\nsummer, and frozen in winter by biting blasts from the Rocky Mountains;\r\nbut the soil improves towards the Mississippi. At its mouth, indeed,\r\nthere are marshes which cover 35,000 square miles, bearing a rank\r\nvegetation, and its delta is a labyrinth of streams and lakes, with\r\ndense brushwood. There are also large tracts of forest and saline\r\nground, especially the Grand Saline between the rivers Arkansas and\r\nNeseikelongo, which is often covered two or three inches deep with salt\r\nlike a fall of snow. All the cultivation on the right bank of the river\r\nis along the Gulf of Mexico and in the adjacent provinces, and is\r\nentirely tropical, consisting of sugar-cane, cotton, and indigo. The\r\nprairies, so characteristic of North America, then begin.\r\n\r\nTo the right of the Mississippi these savannahs are sometimes rolling,\r\nbut oftener level, and interminable as the ocean, covered with long rank\r\ngrass of tender green, blended with flowers chiefly of the liliaceous\r\nkind, which fill the air with their fragrance. In the southern districts\r\nthey are sometimes interspersed with groups of magnolia, tulip, and\r\ncotton trees; and in the north with oak and black walnut. These are rare\r\noccurrences, as the prairies may be traversed for many days without\r\nfinding a shrub, except on the banks of the streams, which are\r\nbeautifully fringed with myrtles, azaleas, kalmias, andromedas, and\r\nrhododendrons. On the wide plains the only objects to be seen are\r\ncountless herds of wild horses, bison, and deer. The country assumes a\r\nmore severe aspect in higher latitudes. It is still capable of producing\r\nrye and barley in the territories of the Assinaiboia Indians, and round\r\nLake Winnepeg there are great forests; a low vegetation with grass\r\nfollows, and towards the Icy Ocean the land is barren and covered with\r\nnumerous lakes.\r\n\r\nEast of the Mississippi there is a magnificent undulating country about\r\n300 miles broad, extending 1000 miles from south to north between that\r\ngreat river and the Alleghany mountains, mostly covered with trees. When\r\nAmerica was discovered, one uninterrupted forest spread over the\r\ncountry, from the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Canadian lakes to the\r\nGulf of Mexico, and from the Atlantic Ocean it crossed the Alleghany\r\nmountains, descended into the valley of the Mississippi on the north,\r\nbut on the south it crossed the main stream of that river altogether,\r\nforming an ocean of vegetation of more than 1,000,000 of square miles,\r\nof which the greater part still remains. Although forests occupy so much\r\nof the country, there are immense prairies on the east side of the river\r\nalso. Pine barrens, stretching far into the interior, occupy the whole\r\ncoast of the Mexican Gulf eastward from the Pearl River, through Alabama\r\nand a great part of Florida.\r\n\r\nThese vast monotonous tracts of sand, covered with forests of gigantic\r\npine-trees, are as peculiarly a distinctive feature of the continent of\r\nNorth America as the prairies, and are not confined to this part of the\r\nUnited States; they occur to a great extent in North Carolina, Virginia,\r\nand elsewhere. Tennessee and Kentucky, though much cleared, still\r\npossess large forests, and the Ohio flows for hundreds of miles among\r\nmagnificent trees, with an undergrowth of azaleas, rhododendrons, and\r\nother beautiful shrubs, matted together by creeping plants. There the\r\nAmerican forests appear in all their glory: the gigantic deciduous\r\ncypress, and the tall tulip-tree, overtopping the forest by half its\r\nheight, a variety of noble oaks, black walnuts, American plane, hickory,\r\nsugar-maple, and the lireodendron, the most splendid of the magnolia\r\ntribe, the pride of the forest.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois waters a country of prairies ever fresh and green, and five\r\nnew states are rising round the great lakes, whose territory of 280,000\r\nsquare miles contains 180,000,000 of acres of land of excellent quality.\r\nThese states, still mostly covered with wood, lie between the lakes and\r\nthe Ohio, and they reach from the Ohio river to the Upper Mississippi—a\r\ncountry twice as large as France, and six times the size of England.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water in the north-eastern part of the central plain\r\ngreatly preponderates over that of the land; the five principal lakes,\r\nHuron, Superior, Michigan, Erie, and Ontario, cover an area equal to\r\nGreat Britain [and Ireland], without reckoning small lakes and rivers\r\ninnumerable.\r\n\r\n[The north-west country, or Upper Mississippi valley, comprehends about\r\nten degrees of latitude, from 39° to 49° north, and about fourteen\r\ndegrees of longitude, from 87° to 101° (from 10° to 24° from the\r\nmeridian of Washington), and contains about 300,000 square miles. A\r\nlarge part of this tract, consisting of the northern portion, is still\r\nheld by the Indians.\r\n\r\nThis country has some very peculiar natural features. The most\r\nremarkable of these is the numberless lakes which spangle its northern\r\nsurface, the remains, no doubt, of a vast sea that once covered the\r\nwhole country extending north from the Gulf of Mexico, possibly to\r\nHudson’s Bay.\r\n\r\nThe country, from the outlets of the Illinois and Missouri rivers to St.\r\nPeter’s, and from Lake Michigan to Council Bluffs, and beyond that point\r\nwesterly, is a vast gently-inclined plane, ascending to the north and to\r\nthe west. Between the Mississippi and the lake the elevation above the\r\nAtlantic has been found to be a little more than 500 feet: and west of\r\nthe river, on the same parallel, towards the Missouri, something more\r\nthan 700 feet. At St. Peter’s it is about 700 feet. Nicollet states that\r\nCouncil Bluffs is 1037 feet above the gulf; and the elevation of Rock\r\nIsland, in the same latitude on the Mississippi, he says, is 528; and\r\nthe height of Fort Pierre Chouteau, on the Missouri, on the same\r\nauthority, is 1456; the lower end of Lake Pepin, in the same latitude\r\n(44° 24ʹ north), is 710 feet, and the mouth of the St. Peter’s, in about\r\nlatitude 45°, is 744 feet. There are a few elevations above the general\r\nrange, called mounds; but with the exception of these, the surface is\r\nmarked only by ravines running down to the beds of the streams, which\r\nare usually from one to two hundred feet lower.\r\n\r\nThere are large tracts of this north-west country wholly destitute of\r\ntree or shrub, and covered only with a luxuriant growth of wild grass,\r\nand beautifully interspersed with flowers of every hue and variety, each\r\nsuccessively making the prairie to look gay with their presence from\r\nApril to October. This beautiful natural meadow yields bountiful returns\r\nfor culture and toil bestowed upon it. It consists of a very dark-brown\r\nvegetable mould, and is mellow beyond the conception of those who are\r\nacquainted only with the hard, stiff soils of the Atlantic slope. This\r\nmould is from one and a half to two feet deep, and entirely free from\r\ngravel. The sub-soil is yellow light clay or clay loam, which resembles\r\nthe soil of timbered lands. The country is a limestone formation. Timber\r\nis found only along the streams: it consists of elm, ash, black walnut,\r\nbutternut, maple, mulberry, and iron-wood, on the bottoms; and on the\r\nupland, white, red, black, and burr-oaks, shell-bark and common hickory,\r\nwith, occasionally, linden, birch, wild-plum and cherry, locust, and\r\nsome other trees. On the Wisconsin and St. Croix rivers are heavy\r\ngrowths of pine, from which supplies of lumber are carried down the\r\nMississippi river.[61]\r\n\r\nThe mighty rivers of this region must be measured by travel, the\r\nprairies must be crossed, and the lakes seen before the mind fully\r\ncomprehends a description of them. “To look at a prairie up or down,”\r\nsays Nicollet, “to ascend one of its undulations; to reach a small\r\nplateau (or, as the voyageurs call it, a _prairie planché_), moving from\r\nwave to wave over alternate swells and depressions; and, finally, to\r\nreach the vast interminable low prairie that extends itself in front,—be\r\nit for hours, days, or weeks, one never tires; pleasurable and\r\nexhilarating sensations are all the time felt; _ennui_ is never\r\nexperienced. Doubtless there are moments when excessive heat, a want of\r\nfresh-water, and other privations, remind one that life is toil; but\r\nthese drawbacks are of short duration. There is almost always a breeze\r\nover them. The security that one feels in knowing that there are no\r\nconcealed dangers—so vast is the extent which the eye takes in—no\r\ndifficulties of road; a far spreading verdure, relieved by a profusion\r\nof variously coloured flowers; the azure of the sky above, or the\r\ntempest that can be seen from its beginning to its end; the beautiful\r\nmodifications of the changing clouds; the curious looming of objects\r\nbetween earth and sky, taxing the ingenuity every moment to rectify:—\r\nall, everything, is calculated to excite the perceptions and keep alive\r\nthe imagination. In the summer season, especially, everything upon the\r\nprairies is cheerful, graceful, and animated. The Indians, with herds of\r\ndeer, antelope, and buffalo, give life and motion to them. It is then\r\nthey should be visited; and I pity the man whose soul could remain\r\nunmoved under such a scene of excitement.”]\r\n\r\nThe Canadas contain millions of acres of good soil, covered with immense\r\nforests. Upper Canada is the most fertile, and in many respects is one\r\nof the most valuable of the British colonies in the west: every European\r\ngrain, and every plant that requires a hot summer and can endure a cold\r\nwinter, thrives there. The forests consist chiefly of black and white\r\nspruce, the Weymouth and other pines—trees which do not admit of\r\nundergrowth: they grow to great height, like bare spars, with a tufted\r\ncrown, casting a deep gloom below. The fall of large trees from age is a\r\ncommon occurrence, and not without danger, as it often causes the\r\ndestruction of those adjacent; and an ice-storm is awful.\r\n\r\nAfter a heavy fall of snow, succeeded by rain and a partial thaw, a\r\nstrong frost coats the trees and all their branches with transparent ice\r\noften an inch thick; the noblest trees bend under the load, icicles hang\r\nfrom every bough, which come down in showers with the least breath of\r\nwind. The hemlock-spruce especially, with its long drooping branches, is\r\nthen like a solid mass. If the wind freshens, the smaller trees become\r\nlike corn beaten down by the tempest, while the large ones swing heavily\r\nin the breeze. The forest at last gives way under its load, tree comes\r\ndown after tree with sudden and terrific violence, crushing all before\r\nthem, till the whole is one wide uproar, heard from afar like successive\r\ndischarges of artillery. Nothing, however, can be imagined more\r\nbrilliant and beautiful than the effect of sunshine in a calm day on the\r\nfrozen boughs, where every particle of the icy crystals sparkles, and\r\nnature seems decked in diamonds.[62]\r\n\r\nAlthough the subsoil is perpetually frozen at the depth of a few feet\r\nbelow the surface beyond the 56th degree of north latitude, yet trees\r\ngrow in some places up to the 64th parallel. Farther north the gloomy\r\nand majestic forests cease, and are succeeded by a bleak, barren waste,\r\nwhich becomes progressively more dreary as it approaches the Arctic\r\nOcean. Four-fifths of it are like the wilds of Siberia in surface and\r\nclimate, covered many months in the year with deep snow. During the\r\nsummer it is the resort of herds of rein-deer and bisons, which come\r\nfrom the south to browse on the tender short grass which then springs up\r\nalong the streams and lakes.\r\n\r\nThe Alleghany or Appalachian chain, which constitutes the second or\r\nsubordinate system of North American mountains, separates the great\r\ncentral plain from that which lies along the Atlantic Ocean. Its base is\r\na strip of table-land, from 1000 to 3000 feet high, lying between the\r\nsources of the rivers Alabama and Yazoo, in the southern states of the\r\nUnion, and New Brunswick, at the mouth of the river St. Lawrence. This\r\nhigh land is traversed throughout 1000 miles, between Alabama and\r\nVermont, by from three to five parallel ridges of low mountains, rarely\r\nmore than 3000 or 4000 feet high, and separated by fertile longitudinal\r\nvalleys, which occupy more than two-thirds of its breadth of 100 miles.\r\nIn Virginia and Pennsylvania, the only part of the chain to which the\r\nname of the Alleghany mountains properly belongs, it is 150 miles broad,\r\nand the whole is computed to have an area of 2,000,000 of square miles.\r\nThe parallelism of the ridges, and the uniform level of their summits,\r\nare the characteristics of this chain, which is lower and less wild than\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. The uniformity of outline in the southern and\r\nmiddle parts of the chain is very remarkable, and results from their\r\npeculiar structure.[63] These mountains have no central axis, but\r\nconsist of a series of convex and concave flexures, forming alternate\r\nhills and longitudinal valleys, running nearly parallel throughout their\r\nlength, and cut transversely by the rivers that flow to the Atlantic on\r\none hand, and to the Mississippi on the other. The watershed nearly\r\nfollows the windings of the coast from the point of Florida to the\r\nnorth-western extremity of the State of Maine.[64]\r\n\r\nThe picturesque and peaceful scenery of the Appalachian mountains is\r\nwell known; they are generally clothed with a luxuriant vegetation, and\r\ntheir western slope is considered one of the finest countries in the\r\nUnited States. To the south they maintain a distance of 200 miles from\r\nthe Atlantic, but approach close to the coast in the south-eastern part\r\nof the State of New York, from whence their general course is northerly\r\nto the river St. Lawrence. But the Blue Mountains, which form the most\r\neasterly ridge, are continued in the double range of the Green Mountains\r\nto Gaspé Point in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. They fill the Canadas,\r\nMaine, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia with branches as high as the mean\r\nelevation of the principal chain, and extend even to the dreary regions\r\nof Baffin’s Bay. The chief Canadian branches are parallel to the river\r\nSt. Lawrence. One goes N.E. from Quebec; and the Mealy Mountains, which\r\nare of much greater length, extend from Ottowa River to Sandwich Bay,\r\nand, though low, are always covered with snow. Little is known of the\r\nhigh lands within the Arctic Circle, except that they probably extend\r\nfrom S.E. to N.W.\r\n\r\nThe country between Hudson’s Bay, the mouths of the Churchill and that\r\nof the Mackenzie river, is also an unknown region; on the east it\r\ndescends steeply to the coast, but the western part, known as the Barren\r\nGround, is low and destitute of wood, except on the banks of the\r\nstreams. The whole is covered with low precipitous hills. Not only the\r\ndeep forests, but vegetation in general, diminishes as the latitude\r\nincreases, till on the arctic shores the soil becomes incapable of\r\nculture, and the majestic forest is superseded by the arctic birch,\r\nwhich creeps on the ground. Many of the islands along the north-eastern\r\ncoasts, though little favoured by nature, produce flax and timber: and\r\nNewfoundland, as large as England and Wales, maintains a population of\r\n70,000 souls by its fisheries: it is nearer to Britain than any part of\r\nAmerica—the distance from the port of St. John to the harbour of\r\nValentia in Ireland is only 1656 nautical miles.\r\n\r\nThe long and comparatively narrow plain which lies between the\r\nAppalachian mountains and the Atlantic extends from the Gulf of Mexico\r\nto the eastern coast of Massachusetts. At its southern extremity it\r\njoins the plain of the Mississippi, and gradually becomes narrower in\r\nits northern course to New England, where it merely includes the coast\r\nislands. It is divided throughout its length by a line of cliffs from\r\n200 to 300 feet high, which begins in Alabama and ends on the coast of\r\nMassachusetts. This escarpment is the eastern edge of the terrace known\r\nas the Atlantic Slope, which rises above the Maritime or Atlantic Plain,\r\nand undulates westward to the foot of the Blue Mountains, the most\r\neastern ridge of the Appalachian chain. It is narrow at its extremities\r\nin Alabama and New York, but in Virginia and the Carolinas it is 200\r\nmiles wide. The surface of the slope is of great uniformity; ridges of\r\nhills and long valleys run along it parallel to the mountains, close to\r\nwhich it is 600 feet high. It is rich in soil and cultivation, and has\r\nan immense water power in the streams and rivers flowing from the\r\nmountains across it, which are precipitated over its rocky edge to the\r\nplains on the west. More than twenty-three rivers of considerably size\r\nfall in cascades down this ledge between New York and the Mississippi,\r\naffording scenes of great beauty.[65]\r\n\r\nBoth land and water assume a new aspect on the Atlantic Plain. The\r\nrivers, after dashing over the rocky barrier, run in tranquil streams to\r\nthe ocean, and the plain itself is a monotonous level, not more than 100\r\nfeet above the surface of the sea. Along the coast it is scooped into\r\nvalleys and ravines, with innumerable creeks.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the magnificent countries east of the Alleghanies is\r\nin a high state of cultivation and commercial prosperity, with natural\r\nadvantages not surpassed in any country. Nature, however, still\r\nmaintains her sway in some parts, especially where pine-barrens and\r\nswamps prevail. The territory of the United States occupies 7,000,000 or\r\n8,000,000 of square miles, the greater part of which is capable of\r\nproducing everything that is useful to man, but not more than a\r\ntwenty-sixth part of it has been cleared. The climate is generally\r\nhealthy, the soil fertile, abounding in mineral treasures, and it\r\npossesses every advantage from navigable rivers and excellent harbours.\r\nThe outposts of civilization have already advanced half-way to the\r\nPacific, and the tide of white men is continually and irresistibly\r\npressing onwards to the ultimate extinction of the original proprietors\r\nof the soil—a melancholy, but not a solitary, instance of the rapid\r\nextinction of a whole race.\r\n\r\nCrystalline and Silurian rocks, rich in precious and other metals, form\r\nthe substratum of Mexico, for the most part covered with plutonic and\r\nvolcanic formations and secondary limestone; yet granite comes to the\r\nsurface on the coast of Acapulco, and occasionally on the plains and\r\nmountains of the table-land. The Rocky Mountains are mostly Silurian,\r\nexcept the eastern ridge, which is of stratified crystalline rocks,\r\namygdaloid and ancient volcanic productions. The coast-chain has the\r\nsame character, with immense tracts of volcanic rocks, both ancient and\r\nmodern, especially obsidian, which is nowhere developed on a greater\r\nscale, except in Mexico and the Andes.\r\n\r\nIn North America, as in the southern part of the continent, volcanic\r\naction is entirely confined to the coast and high land along the\r\nPacific. The numerous vents in Mexico and California are often in great\r\nactivity, and hot springs abound. Though a considerable interval occurs\r\nnorth of them, where the fire is dormant, the country is full of igneous\r\nproductions, and it again finds vent in Prince of Wales’s Archipelago,\r\nwhich has seven active volcanos. From Mount St. Elias westward through\r\nthe whole southern coast of the peninsula of Russian America and the\r\nAleutian Islands, which form a semicircle between Cape Aliaska, in\r\nAmerica, and the peninsula of Kamtchatka, volcanic vents occur, and in\r\nthe latter peninsula there are three of great height.\r\n\r\nFrom the similar nature of the coasts, and the identity of the fossil\r\nmammalia on each side of Behring’s Strait, it is more than probable that\r\nthe two continents were united, even since the sea was inhabited by the\r\nexisting species of shell-fish. Some of the gigantic quadrupeds of the\r\nold continent are supposed to have crossed, either over the land or over\r\nthe ice, to America; and to have wandered southward through the\r\nlongitudinal valleys of the Rocky Mountains, Mexico, and Central\r\nAmerica, and to have spread over the vast plains of both continents,\r\neven to their utmost extremity.[66] An extinct species of horse, the\r\nmastodon, a species of elephant, three gigantic edentata, and a\r\nhollow-horned ruminating animal roamed over the prairies of North\r\nAmerica—certainly since the sea was peopled by its present inhabitants,\r\nprobably even since the existence of the Indians. The skeletons of these\r\ncreatures are found in great numbers in the saline marshes on the\r\nprairies called the Licks, which are still the resort of the existing\r\nraces.[67]\r\n\r\nThere were, however, various animals peculiar to America, as well as to\r\neach part of that continent, at least as far as yet known. South America\r\nstill retains in many cases the type of its ancient inhabitants, though\r\non a very reduced scale. But on the Patagonian plains, and on the\r\nPampas, skeletons of creatures of gigantic size and anomalous forms have\r\nbeen found, one like an anteater of great magnitude, covered with a\r\nprodigious coat of mail similar to that of the armadillo; others like\r\nrats or mice, as large as the hippopotamus—all of which had lived on\r\nvegetables, and had existed at the same time with those already\r\nmentioned. These animals were not destroyed by the agency of man, since\r\ncreatures not larger than a rat vanished from Brazil within the same\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe geological outline of the United States, the Canadas, and all the\r\ncountry of the Polar Ocean, though highly interesting in itself, becomes\r\ninfinitely more so when viewed in connection with that of northern and\r\nmiddle Europe. A remarkable analogy exists in the structure of the land\r\non each side of the North Atlantic basin. Gneiss, mica-schist, and\r\noccasional granite, prevail over wide areas in the Alleghanies, on the\r\nAtlantic Slope, and still more in the northern latitudes of the American\r\ncontinent; and they range also through the greater part of Scandinavia,\r\nFinland, and Lapland. In the latter countries, and in the more northern\r\nparts of America, Sir Charles Lyell has observed that the fossiliferous\r\nrocks belong either to the most ancient or to the newest formations,[68]\r\nto the Silurian strata, or to such as contain shells of recent species\r\nonly, no intermediate formation appearing through immense regions.\r\nSilurian strata extend over 2000 miles in the middle and high latitudes\r\nof North America; they occupy a tract nearly as great between the most\r\nwesterly headlands of Norway and those that separate the White Sea from\r\nthe Polar Ocean; and Sir Roderick Murchison has traced them through\r\ncentral and eastern Europe, and the Ural Mountains, even to Siberia.\r\nThroughout these vast regions, both in America and Europe, the Silurian\r\nstrata are followed in ascending order by the Devonian and carboniferous\r\nformations, which are developed on a stupendous scale in the United\r\nStates, chiefly in the Alleghany mountains and on the Atlantic Slope.\r\nThe Devonian and carboniferous strata together are a mile and a half\r\nthick in New York, and three times as much in Pennsylvania, where one\r\nsingle coal-field occupies 63,000 square miles between the northern\r\nlimits of that state and Alabama. There are many others of great\r\nmagnitude, both in the States and to the north of them, so that most\r\nvaluable of all minerals is inexhaustible, which is not the least of the\r\nmany advantages enjoyed by that flourishing country. The coal formation\r\nis also developed in New Brunswick, and traces of it are found on the\r\nshores and in the islands of the Polar Ocean, on the east coast of\r\nGreenland, and even in Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\nVast carboniferous basins exist in Belgium, above the Silurian strata;\r\nand a great portion of Britain is perfectly similar in structure to\r\nNorth America. The Silurian rocks in many instances are the same, and\r\nthe coal-fields of New England are precisely similar to those in Wales,\r\n3000 miles off.\r\n\r\nIn all the more northern countries that have been mentioned, so very\r\ndistant from one another, the general range of the rocks is from\r\nnorth-east to south-west; and in northern Europe, the British isles, and\r\nNorth America, great lakes are formed along the junction of the strata,\r\nthe whole analogy affording a proof of the wide diffusion of the same\r\ngeological conditions in the northern regions at a very remote period.\r\nAt a later time those erratic blocks, which are now scattered over the\r\nhigher latitudes of both continents, were, most likely, brought from the\r\nnorth by drift ice or currents, while the land was still covered by the\r\ndeep. Volcanic agency has not been wanting to complete the analogy. The\r\nSilurian and overlying strata have been pierced in many places by\r\ntrappean rocks on both continents, and they appear also in the islands\r\nof the North Atlantic and Polar Seas. Even now the volcanic fires are in\r\ngreat activity in the very centre of that basin in Iceland, and in the\r\nvery distant and less-known island of Jan Meyen.\r\n\r\nThe average height of the continents above the level of the sea is the\r\nmean between the height of all the high lands and all the low. Baron\r\nHumboldt, by whom the computation was effected, found that the\r\ntable-lands, with their slopes, on account of their great extent and\r\nmass, have a much greater influence upon the result than\r\nmountain-chains. For example, if the range of the Pyrenees were\r\npulverized, and strewed equally over the whole of Europe, it would only\r\nraise the soil 6 feet; the Alps, which occupy an area four times as\r\ngreat as that on which the Pyrenees stand, would only raise it 22 feet;\r\nwhereas the compact plateau of the Spanish peninsula, which has only\r\n1920 feet of mean height, would elevate the soil of Europe 76 feet; so\r\nthat the table-land of the Spanish peninsula would produce an effect\r\nfour times as great as the whole system of the Alps.\r\n\r\nA great extent of lowland necessarily compensates for the high—at least\r\nit diminishes its effect. The mean elevation of France, including the\r\nPyrenees, Juras, Vosges, and all the other French mountains, is 870\r\nfeet, while the mean height of the whole European continent, of\r\n1,720,000 square miles, is only 670 feet, because the vast European\r\nplain, which is nine times as large as France, has a mean altitude of\r\nbut 380 feet, although it has a few intumescences, which, however, are\r\nnot much above 1000 feet high, so that it is 200 feet lower than the\r\nmean height of France.[69]\r\n\r\nThe great table-land of Eastern Asia, with its colossal mountain-chains,\r\nhas a much less effect on the mean height of Asia than might have been\r\nexpected, on account of the depression round the Caspian Sea; and still\r\nmore from the very low level and the enormous extent of Siberia, which\r\nis a third larger than all Europe. The intumescences in these vast\r\nplains are insignificant in comparison with their vast area, for Tobolsk\r\nis only 115 feet above the level of the sea; and even on the Upper\r\nAngora, at a point nearer the Indian than the Arctic Sea, the elevation\r\nis only 830 feet, which is not half the height of the city of Munich,\r\nand the third part of Asia has a mean height of only 255 feet. The\r\neffect of the Great Gobi, that part of the table-land lying between Lake\r\nBaikal and the wall of China, is diminished by a vast hollow 2560 feet\r\ndeep, the dry basin of an ancient sea of considerable extent near Ergé,\r\nso that this great desert has a mean height of but 4220 feet, and\r\nconsequently it only raises the centre of gravity of the Asiatic\r\ncontinent 128 feet, though it is twice as large as Germany. The\r\ntable-land of Tibet, whose mean elevation, according to Baron Humboldt,\r\nis 11,600 feet, together with the chains of the Himalaya and Kuenlun,\r\nwhich enclose it, only produces an effect of 358 feet. On the whole the\r\nmean level of Asia about the sea is 1150 feet.[70]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the height and length of the Andes, their mass has\r\nlittle effect on the continent of South America on account of the extent\r\nof the eastern plains, which are exactly one-third larger than Europe.\r\nFor if these mountains were reduced to powder, and strewn equally over\r\nthem, it would not raise them above 518 feet; but when the minor\r\nmountain systems and the table-land of Brazil are added to the Andes,\r\nthe mean height of the whole of South America is 1130 feet. North\r\nAmerica, whose mountain-chains are far inferior to those in the southern\r\npart of the continent, has its mean elevation increased by the\r\ntable-land of Mexico, so that it has 750 feet of mean height.\r\n\r\nThe mean elevation of the whole of the New World is 930 feet, and the\r\nheight of the centre of gravity of all the continental masses above the\r\nlevel of the sea, Africa excepted, is 1010 feet. Thus, it appears that\r\nthe internal action in ancient times has been most powerful under Asia,\r\nsomewhat less under South America, considerably less under North\r\nAmerica, and least of all under Europe. In the course of ages changes\r\nwill take place in these results, on account both of the sudden and\r\ngradual rise of the land in some parts of the earth, and its depression\r\nin others. The continental masses of the north are the lowest portions\r\nof our hemisphere, since the mean heights of Europe and North America\r\nare 670 and 750 feet.[71]\r\n\r\nSo little is known of the bed of the ocean that no inference can be\r\ndrawn with regard to its heights and hollows, and what relation its mean\r\ndepth bears to the mean height of the land. From its small influence on\r\nthe gravitating force, La Place assumed it to be about four miles. As\r\nthe mean height of the continents is about 1000 feet, and their extent\r\nonly about a fourth of that of the sea, they might be easily submerged,\r\nwere it not that, in consequence of the sea being only one-fifth of the\r\nmean density of the earth, and the earth itself increasing in density\r\ntowards its centre, La Place has proved that the stability of the\r\nequilibrium of the ocean can never be subverted by any physical cause: a\r\ngeneral inundation from the mere instability of the ocean is therefore\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nThe Continent of Australia—Tasmania, or Van Diemen’s Land—Islands—\r\n  Continental Islands—Pelasgic Islands—New Zealand—New Guinea—Borneo—\r\n  Atolls—Encircling Reefs—Coral Reefs—Barrier Reefs—Volcanic Islands—\r\n  Areas of Subsidence and Elevation in the Bed of the Pacific—Active\r\n  Volcanos—Earthquakes—Secular Changes in the Level of the Land.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE continent of New Holland, situate in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, is\r\nso destitute of large navigable rivers that probably no very high land\r\nexists in its interior, which, as far as it has been explored, seems to\r\nbe singularly flat and low, but it is still so little known that no idea\r\ncan be formed of its mean elevation. It is 2400 miles from east to west,\r\nand 1700 from north to south, and is divided into two unequal parts by\r\nthe Tropic of Capricorn; consequently it has both a temperate and a\r\ntropical climate. New Guinea, separated from New Holland by Torres\r\nStraits, and traversed by the same chain of mountains with New Holland\r\nand Van Diemen’s Land, is so perfectly similar in structure, that it\r\nforms but a detached member of the adjacent continent.\r\n\r\nThe coasts of New Holland are indented by very large bays, and by\r\nharbours that might give shelter to all the navies in Europe. The most\r\ndistinguishing feature of the eastern side, which is chiefly occupied by\r\nthe British colony of New South Wales, is a long chain of mountains\r\nwhich never retires far from the coast, and, with the exception of some\r\nshort deviations in its southern part, maintains a meridional directing\r\nthrough 35 degrees of latitude. It is continued at one extremity from\r\nTorres Straits, at the north of the Gulf of Carpentaria, far into the\r\ninterior of New Guinea; and at the other it traverses the whole of Van\r\nDiemen’s Land. It is low in the northern parts of New Holland, being in\r\nsome places merely a high land; but about the 30th degree of south\r\nlatitude it assumes the form of a regular mountain-chain, and, running\r\nin a very tortuous line from N.E. to S.W., terminates its visible course\r\nat Wilson’s Promontory, the southern extremity of the continent. It is\r\ncontinued, however, by a chain of mountainous islands across Bass’s\r\nStraits to Cape Portland, in Van Diemen’s Land; from thence the range\r\nproceeds in a zigzag line of high and picturesque mountains to South\r\nCape, where it ends, having, in its course of 1500 miles, separated the\r\ndrainage of both countries into eastern and western waters.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the chain from the sea in New South Wales is from 50 to\r\n100 miles, but at the 32d parallel it recedes to 150, yet soon returns,\r\nand forms the wild group of the Corecudgy Peaks, from whence, under the\r\nnames of the Blue Mountains and Australian Alps, its highest part, it\r\nproceeds in a general westerly direction to the land’s end.\r\n\r\nThe average height of these mountains is only from 2400 to 4700 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, and even Mount Kosciusko, the loftiest of\r\nthe Australian Alps, is not more than 6500 feet high; yet its position\r\nis so favourable, that the view from its snowy and craggy top sweeps\r\nover an area of 7000 square miles. The rugged and savage character of\r\nthese mountains far exceeds what might be expected from their height: in\r\nsome places, it is true, their tops are rounded and covered with\r\nforests; but by far the greater part of the chain, though wooded along\r\nthe flanks, is crowned by naked needles, tooth-formed peaks, and flat\r\ncrests of granite or porphyry, mingled with patches of snow. The spurs\r\ngive a terrific character to these mountains, and in many places render\r\nthem altogether inaccessible, both in New South Wales and Van Diemen’s\r\nLand. These shoot right and left from the ridgy axis of the main range,\r\nequal to it in height, and separated from it, and from one another, by\r\ndark and almost subterraneous gullies, like rents in the bosom of the\r\nearth, iron-bound by impracticable precipices, and streams flowing\r\nthrough them in black silent eddies or foaming torrents. The intricate\r\ncharacter of these ravines, the danger of descending into them, and the\r\ndifficulty of getting out again, render this mountain-chain, in New\r\nSouth Wales at least, almost a complete barrier between the country on\r\nthe coast and that in the interior—a circumstance very unfavourable to\r\nthe latter.[72]\r\n\r\nIn New South Wales the country slopes westward from these mountains to a\r\nlow, flat, unbroken plain. On the east side, darkly verdant and\r\nround-topped hills and ridges are promiscuously grouped together,\r\nleading to a richly-wooded undulating country, which gradually descends\r\nto the coast, and forms the valuable lands of the British colony.\r\nDiscovered by Cook in the year 1770, it was not colonized till 1788. It\r\nhas become a prosperous country; and although new settlers in the more\r\nremote parts suffer the privations and difficulties incident to their\r\nposition, yet there is educated society in the towns, with the comforts\r\nand luxuries of civilized life.\r\n\r\nThe coast-belt on the western side of New Holland is generally of\r\ninferior land, with richer tracts interspersed near the rivers, and\r\nbounded on the east by a range of primary mountains from 3000 to 4000\r\nfeet high, in which granite occasionally appears. Beyond this the\r\ncountry is level, and the land better, though nowhere very productive\r\nexcept in grass.\r\n\r\nNone of the rivers of New Holland are navigable to any great distance\r\nfrom their mouths. The want of water is severely felt in the interior,\r\nwhich, as far as it is known, is a treeless desert of sand, swamps, and\r\njungle; yet a belief prevails that there is a large sea or fresh-water\r\nlake in its centre; and this opinion is founded partly on the nature of\r\nthe soil, and also because all the rivers that flow into the sea on the\r\nnorthern coast, between the Gulfs of Van Diemen and Carpentaria,\r\nconverge towards their sources, as if they served for drains to some\r\nlarge body of water.\r\n\r\nHowever unpropitious the centre of the continent may be—and the shores\r\ngenerally have the same barren character—there is abundance of fine\r\ncountry inland from the coast. On the north all tropical productions\r\nmight be raised, and in so large a continent there must be extensive\r\ntracts of arable land, though its peculiar character is pastoral. There\r\nare large forests on the mountains and elsewhere, yet that moisture is\r\nwanting which clothes other countries in the same latitudes with rank\r\nvegetation. In the colonies, the clearing of a great extent of land has\r\nmodified in some degree the mean annual temperature, so that the climate\r\nhas become hotter and drier, and not thereby improved.\r\n\r\nVan Diemen’s Land, of triangular form, has an area of 27,200 square\r\nmiles, and is very mountainous. No country has a greater number of deep,\r\ncommodious harbours; and as most of the rivers, though not navigable to\r\nany distance, end in arms of the sea, they afford secure anchorage for\r\nships of any size. The mountain-chain that traverses the colony of New\r\nSouth Wales and the islands in Bass’s Straits, rises again from Cape\r\nPortland, and, winding through Van Diemen’s Land in the form of the\r\nletter Z, separates it into two nearly equal parts, with a mean height\r\nof 3750 feet, and at an average distance of 40 miles from the sea. It\r\nencloses the basins of Derwent and Heron rivers, and, after sending a\r\nbranch between them to Hobart Town, ends at South Cape. The offsets\r\nwhich shoot in all directions are as savage and full of impassable\r\nchasms as it is itself. There are cultivable plains and valleys along\r\nthe numerous rivers and large lakes by which the country is well\r\nwatered; so that Van Diemen’s Land is more agricultural and fertile than\r\nthe adjacent continent, but its climate is wet and cold. The uncleared\r\nsoil of both countries, however, is far inferior to that in the greater\r\npart of North or South America.[73]\r\n\r\nGranite constitutes the entire floor of the western portion of New South\r\nWales, and extends far into the interior of the continent, bearing a\r\nstriking resemblance in character to a similar portion of the Altaï\r\nchain described by Baron Humboldt. The central axis of the\r\nmountain-range, in New South Wales and in Van Diemen’s Land, is of\r\ngranite, syenite, and quartz rock; but in early times there had been\r\ngreat invasions of volcanic substances, as many parts of the main chain,\r\nand most of its offsets, are of the older igneous rocks. The\r\nfossiliferous strata of the two colonies are mostly of the Palæozoic\r\nperiod, but their fossil fauna is poor in species. Some are identical\r\nwith, and others are representatives of, the species of other countries,\r\neven of England. It appears from their coal-measures that the flora of\r\nthese countries was as distinct in appearance from that of the northern\r\nhemisphere, previous to the carboniferous period, as it is at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThough the innumerable islands that are scattered through the ocean and\r\nseas differ much in size, form, and character, they have been grouped by\r\nM. Von Buch into the two distinct classes of Continental and Pelasgic\r\nislands, most of the latter being either of volcanic or coral formation.\r\nContinental islands are long in proportion to their breadth, and follow\r\neach other in succession along the margin of the continents, as if they\r\nhad been formed during the elevation of the mainland, or had\r\nsubsequently been separated from it by the action of the sea, and still\r\nmark its ancient boundary. These islands, which follow one another in\r\ntheir elongated dimensions, generally run parallel to the maritime\r\nchains of mountains, and are mostly of the same structure, so that they\r\nsuggest the idea of a submarine portion of the maritime range that has\r\nnot yet completely emerged from the deep—or, if sinking, has not yet\r\ndisappeared below the waves.\r\n\r\nAmerica offers numerous examples of this kind of island. On the\r\nnorth-western coast there is a long chain of them, beginning with the\r\nNew Norfolk group, and ending with Vancouver’s Island, all similar and\r\nparallel to the maritime chain. Another range of Continental islands\r\noccurs at the southern extremity of America, extending from Chiloe to\r\nCape Horn, evidently an exterior range of the Patagonian Andes, and the\r\nsouthern prolongation of the granitic or coast chain of Chile; in the\r\nGulf of Mexico, the ancient margin of the mainland is marked by the\r\ncurved group of Porto Rico, San Domingo, Jamaica, and Cuba, which nearly\r\njoins the peninsula of Yucatan. The various islands along the American\r\ncoast of the Polar Ocean are the shattered fragments of the continent.\r\n\r\nThe old continent also affords innumerable examples; along the whole\r\ncoast of Norway, from North Cape southwards, there is a continuous chain\r\nof rocky islands similar and parallel to the great range of the\r\nScandinavian Alps; Great Britain itself, with the Hebrides, Orkney, and\r\nZetland islands, are remarkable instances of Continental islands. It\r\nwould be superfluous to mention the various instances which occur in the\r\nMediterranean, where many of the islands are merely the prolongations of\r\nthe mountain-chains of the mainland rising above the sea, as Corsica and\r\nSardinia, which are a continuation of the Maritime Alps.\r\n\r\nThe great central chain of Madagascar and its elongated form, parallel\r\nto the Lupata Mountains, show that the island once formed part of the\r\nAfrican continent. Asia, also, abounds in instances, as Sumatra, Java,\r\nand the Moluccas, and another vast chain extends along the western coast\r\nof Asia from Formosa to Kamtchatka.\r\n\r\nPelasgic islands have risen from the bed of the ocean, independently of\r\nthe continents, and generally far from land. They are mostly volcanic,\r\naltogether or in part; often very lofty; sometimes single, and\r\nfrequently in groups, and each group has, or formerly has had, a centre\r\nof volcanic action in one or more of the islands, round which the others\r\nhave been formed. Many have craters of elevation, that is to say, they\r\nhave been raised up in great hollow domes by the internal elastic\r\nvapours, and have either remained so, have become rent at the surface\r\ninto gigantic fissures, or have collapsed into hollow cups, in which\r\ncraters have formed, by the eruption of loose incoherent matter, or of\r\nlava currents, when the pressure from below was removed:[74] a\r\nconsiderable number have active vents.\r\n\r\nThe small islands and groups scattered at enormous distances from one\r\nanother, within the Antarctic Circle, are all of volcanic formation,\r\nthough none are active. In the Atlantic, Tristan da Cunha, St. Helena,\r\nAscension, and Madeira are volcanic, though not now actively so; whereas\r\nthe Cape de Verde, Canaries, and Azores have each volcanic vents: the\r\npeak of Teyda, in Teneriffe, is one of the most magnificent volcanic\r\ncones in the world.\r\n\r\nThe labyrinth of islands scattered over the Pacific Ocean for more than\r\n30 degrees on each side of the equator, and from the 130th eastern\r\nmeridian to Sumatra, which all but unites this enormous archipelago to\r\nthe continent of Asia, has the group of New Zealand or Tasmania, and the\r\ncontinent of Australia, with its appendage, Van Diemen’s Land, on the\r\nsouth, and altogether forms a region which, from, the unstable nature of\r\nthe surface of the earth, is partly the wreck of a continent that has\r\nbeen engulfed by the ocean, and partly the summits of a new one rising\r\nabove the waves. This extensive portion of the globe is in many parts\r\nterra incognita; the Indian Archipelago has been little explored, and,\r\nwith the exception of our colonies in New Holland and New Zealand, is\r\nlittle known.\r\n\r\nM. Von Buch conceives that the enormous circuit, beginning with New\r\nZealand and extending through Norfolk Island, New Caledonia, New\r\nHebrides, Solomon’s Island, New Britain, New Hanover, New Ireland,\r\nLouisiade, and New Guinea, once formed the western and northern boundary\r\nof the Australian continent.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand, divided into three islands by rocky and dangerous channels,\r\nis superior to Australia in richness of soil, fertility, and beauty; it\r\nabounds in a variety of vegetable and mineral productions. High\r\nmountains, of volcanic origin, run through the islands, which, in the\r\nmost northerly, rise 14,000 feet above the stormy ocean around, buried\r\ntwo-thirds of their height in permanent snow and glaciers, exhibiting on\r\nthe grandest scale all the alpine characters, with the addition of\r\nactive volcanos on the eastern and western coasts: that of Tangarara\r\npours forth deluges of boiling water, which deposit vast quantities of\r\nsiliceous sinter like the Geysers in Iceland; and such is the vitality\r\nof the vegetation, that plants grow richly on the banks, and even in\r\nwater too hot to be endured.[75] The coast is a frozen country,\r\noverspread with a most luxuriant but dark and gloomy vegetation. There\r\nare undulating tracts and table-lands of great extent without a tree,\r\nover-run by ferns and a low kind of myrtle; but the mountain-ridges are\r\nclothed with dense and gigantic forests. There is much good land and\r\nmany lakes, with navigable rivers, the best of harbours, and a mild\r\nclimate; so that no country is better suited for a prosperous and\r\nflourishing colony. It may be considered, even at this early period of\r\nits colonial existence, as the Great Britain of the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nA very different scene from the stormy seas of New Zealand presents\r\nitself to the north of Australia. There, vivified by the glowing sun of\r\nthe equator, the islands of the Indian Archipelago are of matchless\r\nbeauty, crowned by lofty mountains, loaded with aromatic verdure, that\r\nshelve to the shore, or dip into a transparent glassy sea. Their coasts\r\nare cut by deep inlets, and watered by the purest streams, which descend\r\nin cascades rushing through wild crevices. The whole is so densely\r\ncovered with palms and other beautiful forms of tropical vegetation that\r\nthey seem to realize a terrestrial paradise.\r\n\r\nPapua or New Guinea, the largest island in the Pacific after New\r\nHolland, is 1100 miles long and 400 in width, with mountains rising\r\nabove mountains, till in the west they attain the height of 16,000 feet,\r\ncapped with snow, and two volcanos burn on its northern shores. From its\r\nposition so near the equator it is probable that New Guinea has the same\r\nvegetation with the Spice Islands to the east, and, from the little that\r\nis known of it, must be one of the finest countries in existence.\r\n\r\nBorneo, next in size to New Guinea, is a noble island, divided into two\r\nnearly equal parts by the equator, and traversed through its whole\r\nlength by magnificent chains of mountains, which end in three branches\r\nat the Java Sea. Beautiful rivers flow from them to the plains, and\r\nseveral of these spring from a spacious lake on the table-land in the\r\ninterior, among the peaks of Keni-Balu, the highest point of the island.\r\nDiamonds, gold, and antimony are among its minerals; gums, gutta percha,\r\nprecious woods, and all kinds of spices and tropical fruits are among\r\nits vegetable productions.\r\n\r\nSituate in the centre of a vast archipelago, and in the direct line of\r\nan extensive and valuable commerce, it will in the course of time become\r\nthe seat of a great nation, whose civilization and prosperity will hand\r\ndown to posterity the name of the enterprising, philanthropic Sir James\r\nBrooke, Rajah of Sarawak, with the highest honour to which man can\r\naspire. The climate is healthy, tempered by sea-breezes, and in some\r\nparts even European; and its appendage, the small island of Labuan, rich\r\nin coal, is happily situate in the route of steam-vessels between India\r\nand China.\r\n\r\nA volume might be written on the beauty and riches of the Indian\r\nArchipelago. Many of the islands are hardly known; the interior of the\r\ngreater number has never been explored, so that they offer a wide field\r\nof discovery to the enterprising traveller, and they are now of easier\r\naccess since the seas have been cleared of pirates by the exertions of\r\nthe Honourable Captain Keppel, and other officers of Her Majesty’s Navy.\r\n\r\nThey have become of much importance since our relations with China have\r\nbeen extended, on which account surveys of their coasts have been\r\nalready made, and are going on, under the able direction of the\r\nHydrographer of the Navy, Sir F. Beaufort. The great intertropical\r\nislands of the Pacific, likewise other large islands, as Ceylon and\r\nMadagascar, in the Indian Seas, which by the way do not differ in\r\ncharacter from the preceding, are really continents in miniature, with\r\ntheir mountains and plains, their lakes and rivers; and in climate they\r\nvary, like the main land, with the latitude, only that continental\r\nclimates are more extreme both as to heat and cold.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular circumstance, arising from the instability of the crust\r\nof the earth, that all the smaller tropical pelasgic islands in the\r\nPacific and Indian Oceans are either volcanic or coralline, except New\r\nCaledonia and the Seychelles; and it is a startling fact, that in most\r\ncases where there are volcanos the land is rising by slow and almost\r\nimperceptible degrees above the ocean, whereas there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that those vast spaces, studded with coral islands or atolls,\r\nare actually sinking below it, and have been for ages.[76]\r\n\r\nThere are four different kinds of coral formations in the Pacific and\r\nIndian Oceans, all entirely produced by the growth of organic beings,\r\nand their detritus, namely, lagoon islands or atolls, encircling reefs,\r\nbarrier reefs, and coral fringes. They are all nearly confined to the\r\ntropical regions; the atolls to the Pacific and Indian Oceans alone.\r\n\r\nAn atoll or lagoon island consists of a chaplet or ring of coral,\r\nenclosing a lagoon or portion of the ocean in its centre. The average\r\nbreadth of the part of the ring above the surface of the sea is about a\r\nquarter of a mile, oftener less, and it seldom rises higher than from 6\r\nto 10 or 12 feet above the waves. Hence, the lagoon islands are not\r\ndiscernible, even at a very small distance, unless when they are covered\r\nwith the cocoa-nut, palm, or the pandanus, which is frequently the case.\r\nOn the outer side this ring or circlet shelves down to the distance of\r\n100 or 200 yards from its edge, so that the sea gradually deepens to 25\r\nfathoms, beyond which the sides plunge at once into the unfathomable\r\ndepths of the ocean, with a more rapid descent than the cone of any\r\nvolcano. Even at the small distance of some hundred yards, no bottom has\r\nbeen found with a sounding-line a mile and a half long. All the coral at\r\na moderate depth below water is alive—all above is dead, being the\r\ndetritus of the living part, washed up by the surf, which is so\r\ntremendous on the windward side of the tropical islands of the Pacific\r\nand Indian Oceans, that it is often heard miles off, and is frequently\r\nthe first warning to seamen of their approach to an atoll.\r\n\r\nOn the lagoon side, where the water is calm, the bounding ring or reef\r\nshelves into it by a succession of ledges, also of living coral, though\r\nnot of the same species with those which build the exterior wall and the\r\nfoundations of the whole ring. The perpetual change of water brought\r\ninto contact with the external coral by the breakers probably supplies\r\nthem with more food than they could obtain in a quieter sea, which may\r\naccount for their more luxuriant growth. At the same time, they deprive\r\nthe whole of the coral in the interior of the most nourishing part of\r\ntheir food, because the still water in the lagoon, being supplied from\r\nthe exterior by openings in the ring, ceases to produce the hardier\r\ncorals; and species of more delicate forms, and of much slower growth,\r\ntake their place.[77] The depth of the lagoon varies, in different\r\natolls, from 20 to 50 fathoms, the bottom being partly detritus and\r\npartly live coral. By the growth of the coral, some few of the lagoons\r\nhave been filled up; but the process is very slow from the causes\r\nassigned, and also because there are marine animals that feed on the\r\nliving coral, and prevent its indefinite growth. In all departments of\r\nnature, the exuberant increase of any one class is checked and limited\r\nby others. The coral is of the most varied and delicate structure, and\r\nof the most beautiful tints: dark brown, vivid green, rich purple, pink,\r\ndeep blue, peach-colour, yellow, with dazzling white, contrasted with\r\ndeep shadows, shine through the limpid water; while fish of the most\r\ngorgeous hues swim among the branching coral, which are of many\r\ndifferent kinds, though all combine in the structure of these singular\r\nislands. Lagoon islands are sometimes circular, but more frequently oval\r\nor irregular in their form. Sometimes they are solitary or in groups,\r\nbut they occur most frequently in elongated archipelagos, with the\r\natolls elongated in the same direction. The grouping of atolls bear a\r\nperfect analogy to the grouping of the archipelagos of ordinary islands.\r\n\r\nThe size of these fairy rings of the ocean varies from 2 to 90 miles in\r\ndiameter, and islets are frequently formed on the coral rings by the\r\nwashing up of the detritus, for they are so low that the waves break\r\nover them in high tides or storms. They have openings or channels in\r\ntheir circuit, generally on the leeward side, where the tide enters, and\r\nby these ships may sail into the lagoons, which are excellent harbours,\r\nand even on the surface of the circlet or reef itself there are\r\noccasionally boat-channels between the islets.\r\n\r\nDangerous Archipelago, lying east of the Society Islands, is one of the\r\nmost remarkable assemblages of atolls in the Pacific Ocean. There are 80\r\nof them, generally in a circular form, surrounding very deep lagoons,\r\nand separated from each other by profound depths. The reefs or rings are\r\nabout half a mile wide, and seldom rise more than 10 feet above the edge\r\nof the surf, which beats upon them with such violence that it may be\r\nheard at the distance of 8 miles; and yet on that side the coral insects\r\nbuild more vigorously, and vegetation thrives better, than on the other.\r\nMany of the islets are inhabited.\r\n\r\nThe Caroline Archipelago, the largest of all, lies north of the equator,\r\nand extends its atolls in 60 groups over 1000 miles. Many are of great\r\nsize, and all are beat by a tempestuous sea and occasional hurricanes.\r\nThe atolls in the Pacific Ocean and China Sea are beyond enumeration.\r\nThough less frequent in the Indian Ocean, none are more interesting, or\r\nafford more perfect specimens of this peculiar formation, than the\r\nMaldive and Laccadive archipelagos, both nearly parallel to the coast of\r\nMalabar, and elongated in that direction. The former is 470 miles long\r\nand about 50 miles broad, with atolls arranged in a double row,\r\nseparated by an unfathomable sea, into which their sides descend with\r\nmore than ordinary rapidity. The largest atoll is 88 miles long and\r\nsomewhat less than 20 broad; Suadiva, the next in size, is 44 miles by\r\n23, with a large lagoon in its centre, to which, there is access by 42\r\nopenings. There are inhabited islets on most of the chaplets or rings\r\nnot higher than 20 feet, while the reefs themselves are nowhere more\r\nthan 6 feet above the surge.\r\n\r\nThe Laccadives run to the north of this archipelago in a double line of\r\nnearly circular atolls, on which are low inhabited islets.\r\n\r\nEncircling reefs differ in no respect from atoll-reefs, except that they\r\nhave one or more islands in their lagoon. They commonly form a ring\r\nround mountainous islands, at a distance of two or three miles from the\r\nshore, rising on the outside from a very deep ocean, and separated from\r\nthe land by a lagoon or channel 200 or 300 feet deep. These reefs\r\nsurround the submarine base of the island, and, rising by a steep ascent\r\nto the surface, they encircle the island itself. The Caroline\r\nArchipelago exhibits good examples of this structure in the encircled\r\nislands of Hogoleu and Siniavin; the narrow ring or encircling reef of\r\nthe former is 135 miles in its very irregular circuit, on which are a\r\nvast number of islets: six or eight islands rise to a considerable\r\nheight from its lagoon, which is so deep, and the opening to it so\r\nlarge, that a frigate might sail into it. The encircling reef of\r\nSiniavin is narrow and irregular, and its lagoon is so nearly filled by\r\na lofty island, that it leaves only a strip of water round it from 2 to\r\n5 miles wide and 30 fathoms deep.\r\n\r\nOtaheite [Tahiti], the largest of the Society group, is another instance\r\nof an encircled island of the most beautiful kind; it rises in mountains\r\n7000 feet high, with only a narrow plain along the shore, and, except\r\nwhere cleared for cultivation, it is covered with forests of cocoa-nut,\r\npalms, bananas, bread-fruit, and other productions of a tropical\r\nclimate. The lagoon, which encompasses it like an enormous moat, is 30\r\nfathoms deep, and is hemmed in from the ocean by a coral band of the\r\nusual kind, at a distance varying from half a mile to three miles.\r\n\r\nBarrier-reefs are of precisely the same structure as the two preceding\r\nclasses, from which they only differ in their position with regard to\r\nthe land. A barrier reef off the north-east coast of the continent of\r\nAustralia is the grandest coral formation existing. Rising at once from\r\nan unfathomable ocean, it extends 1000 miles along the coast, with a\r\nbreadth varying from 200 yards to a mile, and at an average distance of\r\nfrom 20 to 30 miles from the shore, increasing in some places to 60 and\r\neven 70 miles. The great arm of the sea included between it and the land\r\nis nowhere less than 10, occasionally 60 fathoms deep, and is safely\r\nnavigable throughout its whole length, with a few transverse openings by\r\nwhich ships can enter. The reef is really 1200 miles long, because it\r\nstretches nearly across Torres Straits. It is interrupted off the\r\nsouthern coast of New Guinea by muddy water, which destroys the coral\r\nanimals, probably from some great river on that island. There are also\r\nextensive barrier-reefs on the islands of Louisiade and New Caledonia,\r\nwhich are exactly opposite to the great Australian reef; and as atolls\r\nstud that part of the Pacific which lies between them, it is called the\r\nCoralline Sea. The rolling of the billows along the great Australian\r\nreef has been admirably described. “The long ocean-swell, being suddenly\r\nimpeded by this barrier, lifted itself in one great continuous ridge of\r\ndeep blue water, which, curling over, fell on the edge of the reef in an\r\nunbroken cataract of dazzling white foam. Each line of breaker ran often\r\none or two miles in length with not a perceptible gap in its continuity.\r\nThere was a simple grandeur and display of power and beauty in this\r\nscene that rose even to sublimity. The unbroken roar of the surf, with\r\nits regular pulsation of thunder, as each succeeding swell fell first on\r\nthe outer edge of the reef, was almost deafening, yet so deep-toned as\r\nnot to interfere with the slightest nearer and sharper sound.... Both\r\nthe sound and sight were such as to impress the spectator with the\r\nconsciousness of standing in the presence of an overwhelming majesty and\r\npower.”[78]\r\n\r\nCoral-reefs are distinct from all the foregoing; they are merely fringes\r\nof coral along the margin of a shore, and, as they line the shore\r\nitself, they have no lagoons. A vast extent of coast, both on the\r\ncontinents and islands, is fringed by these reefs, and, as they\r\nfrequently surround these shoals, they are very dangerous.\r\n\r\nLagoon islands are the work of various species of coral animals; but\r\nthose particular polypi which build the external wall, the foundation\r\nand support of the whole ring or reef, are most vigorous when most\r\nexposed to the breakers; they cannot exist at a greater depth than 25 or\r\n30 fathoms at most, and die immediately when left dry: yet the coral\r\nwall descends precipitously to unfathomable depths; and although the\r\nwhole of it is not the work of these animals, yet the perpendicular\r\nthickness of the coral is known to be very great, extending hundreds of\r\nfeet below the depth at which these polypi cease to live. From an\r\nextensive survey of the Coralline Seas of the tropics, Mr. Darwin has\r\nfound an explanation of these singular phenomena in the instability of\r\nthe crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nSince there are certain proofs that large areas of the dry land are\r\ngradually rising, and others sinking down, so the bottom of the ocean is\r\nnot exempt from the general change that is slowly bringing about a new\r\nstate of things; and as there is evidence, on multitudes of the volcanic\r\nislands in the Pacific, of a rise in certain parts of the basis of the\r\nocean, so the lagoon islands indicate a subsidence in others—changes\r\narising from the expansion and contraction of the strata under the bed\r\nof the ocean.\r\n\r\nThere are strong reasons for believing that a continent once occupied a\r\ngreat part of the tropical Pacific, some part of which subsided by slow\r\nand imperceptible degrees. As portions of it gradually sank down below\r\nthe surface of the deep, the tops of mountains and table-lands would\r\nremain as islands of different magnitude and elevation, and would form\r\narchipelagos elongated in the direction of the mountain-chains. Now, the\r\ncoral-animal, which constructs the outward wall and mass of the reefs,\r\nnever builds laterally, and cannot exist at a greater depth than 25 or\r\n30 fathoms. Hence, if it began to lay the foundation of its reef on the\r\nsubmerged flanks of an island, it would be obliged to build its wall\r\nupwards in proportion as the island sank down, so that at length a\r\nlagoon would be formed between it and the land. As the subsidence\r\ncontinued, the lagoon would increase, the island would diminish, and the\r\nbase of the coral-reef would sink deeper and deeper, while the animal\r\nwould always keep its top just below the surface of the ocean, till at\r\nlength the island would entirely disappear, and a perfect atoll would be\r\nleft. If the island were mountainous, each peak would form a separate\r\nisland in the lagoon, and the encircled islands would have different\r\nforms, which the reefs would follow continuously. This theory perfectly\r\nexplains the appearances of the lagoon islands and barrier-reefs, the\r\ncontinuity of the reef, the islands in the middle of the lagoons, the\r\ndifferent distances of the reefs from them, and the forms of the\r\narchipelago, so exactly similar to the archipelagos of ordinary islands,\r\nall of which are but the tops of submerged mountain-chains, and\r\ngenerally partake of their elongated forms.[79]\r\n\r\nEvery intermediate form between an atoll and an encircling reef exists:\r\nNew Caledonia is a link between them. A reef runs along the\r\nnorth-western coast of that island 400 miles, and for many leagues never\r\napproaches within 8 miles of its shore, and the distance increases to 16\r\nmiles near the southern extremity. At the other end the reefs are\r\ncontinued on each side 150 miles beyond the sub-marine prolongation of\r\nthe land, marking the former extent of the island. In the lagoon of\r\nKeeling Atoll, situate in the Indian Ocean, 600 miles south of Sumatra,\r\nmany fallen trees and a ruined store-house show that it has subsided:\r\nthese movements take place during the earthquakes at Sumatra, which are\r\nalso felt in this atoll. Violent earthquakes have lately been felt at\r\nVanikora (celebrated for the wreck of La Pérouse), a lofty island of the\r\nQueen Charlotte group, with an encircling reef in the western part of\r\nthe South Pacific, and on which there are marks of recent subsidence.\r\nOther proofs are not wanting of this great movement in the beds of the\r\nPacific and Indian Oceans.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the atoll formations, including under this name the\r\nencircling reefs, is enormous. In the Pacific, from the southern end of\r\nLow Archipelago to the northern extremity of Marshall or Radick\r\nArchipelago, a distance of 4500 miles, and many degrees of latitude in\r\nbreadth, atolls alone rise above the ocean. The same may be said of the\r\nspace in the Indian Ocean between Saya de Matha and the end of the\r\nLaccadives, which includes 25 degrees of latitude—such are the enormous\r\nareas that have been, and probably still are, slowly subsiding. Other\r\nspaces of great extent may also be mentioned, as the large archipelago\r\nof the Carolinas, that in the Coralline Sea of the north-west coast of\r\nAustralia, and an extensive one in the China Sea.\r\n\r\nThough the volcanic islands in the Pacific are so numerous, there is not\r\none within the areas mentioned, and there is not an active volcano\r\nwithin several hundred miles of an archipelago, or even group of atolls.\r\nThis is the more interesting, as recent shells and fringes of dead\r\ncoral, found at various heights on their surfaces, show that the\r\nvolcanic islands have been rising more and more above the surface of the\r\nocean for a very long time.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic islands also occupy particular zones in the Pacific, and it\r\nis found from extensive observation that all the points of eruption fall\r\non the areas of elevation.[80]\r\n\r\nOne of the most terribly active of these zones begins with the Banda\r\ngroup of islands, and extends through the Sunda group of Timor, Sumbawa,\r\nBali, Java, and Sumatra, separated only by narrow channels, and\r\naltogether forming a gently curved line 2000 miles long; but as the\r\nvolcanic zone is continued through Barren Island and Narcondam in the\r\nBay of Bengal, northward through the islands along the coast of Aracan,\r\nthe entire length of this volcanic range is a great deal more. During\r\nthe last hundred years all the islands and rocks for 100 miles along the\r\ncoast of Aracan have been gradually rising. The greatest elevation of 22\r\nfeet has taken place about the centre of the line of upheaval, in the\r\nnorth-west end of the island of Cheduba, containing two mud volcanos,\r\nand is continued through Foul Island and the Terribles.[81]\r\n\r\nThe little island of Gonung-Api, belonging to the Banda group, contains\r\na volcano of great activity; and such is the elevating pressure of the\r\nsubmarine fire in that part of the ocean, that a mass of black basalt\r\nrose up, of such magnitude as to fill a bay 60 fathoms deep, so quietly\r\nthat the inhabitants were not aware of what was going on till it was\r\nnearly done. Timor and the other adjacent islands also bear marks of\r\nrecent elevation.\r\n\r\nThere is not a spot of its size on the face of the earth that contains\r\nso many volcanos as the island of Java.[82] A range of volcanic\r\nmountains, from 5000 to 13,000 feet high, forms the central crest of the\r\nisland, and ends to the east in a series of 38 separate volcanos with\r\nbroad bases, rising gradually into cones. They all stand on a plain but\r\nlittle elevated above the sea, and each individual mountain seems to\r\nhave been formed independently of the rest. Most of them are of great\r\nantiquity, and are covered with thick vegetation. Some are extinct, or\r\nonly emit smoke; from others sulphureous vapours issue with prodigious\r\nviolence; one has a large crater filled with boiling water; and a few\r\nhave had fierce eruptions of late years. The island is covered with\r\nvolcanic spurs from the main ridge, united by cross chains, together\r\nwith other chains of less magnitude, but no less fury.\r\n\r\nIn 1772 the greater part of one of the largest volcanic mountains was\r\nswallowed up after a short but severe combustion; a luminous cloud\r\nenveloped the mountain on the 11th of August, and soon after the huge\r\nmass actually disappeared under the earth with tremendous noise,\r\ncarrying with it about 90 square miles of the surrounding country, 40\r\nvillages, and 2957 of their inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe northern coast of Java is flat and swampy, but the southern\r\nprovinces are beautiful and romantic; yet in the lovely peaceful valleys\r\nthe stillness of night is disturbed by the deep roaring of the volcanos,\r\nmany of which are perpetually burning with slow but terrific action.\r\n\r\nSeparated by narrow channels of the sea, Bali and Sumbawa are but a\r\ncontinuation of Java, the same in nature and structure, but on a smaller\r\nscale, their mountains being little more than 8000 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the volcanic force under this part of the Pacific may\r\nbe imagined from the eruption of Tomboro in Sumbawa in 1815, which\r\ncontinued from the 5th of April till July. The explosions were heard at\r\nthe distance of 970 miles; and in Java, at the distance of 300 miles,\r\nthe darkness during the day was like that of deep midnight, from the\r\nquantity of ashes that filled the air: they were carried to Bencoolen, a\r\ndistance of 1100 miles, which, with regard to distance, is as if the\r\nashes of Vesuvius had fallen at Birmingham. The country round was\r\nruined, and the town of Tomboro was submerged by heavy rollers from the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nIn Sumatra the extensive granitic formations of Eastern Asia join the\r\nvolcanic series which occupies so large a portion of the Pacific. This\r\nmost beautiful of islands presents the boldest aspect; it is indented by\r\narms of the most transparent sea, and watered by innumerable streams; it\r\ndisplays in its vegetation all the bright colouring of the tropics. Here\r\nthe submarine fire finds vent in three volcanos on the southern, and one\r\non the northern side of the island. A few atolls, many hundreds of miles\r\nto the south, show that this volcanic zone alternates with an area of\r\nsubsidence.\r\n\r\nMore to the north, and nearly parallel to the preceding zone, another\r\nline of volcanic islands begins to the north of New Guinea, and passes\r\nthrough New Britain, New Ireland, Solomon Islands, and the New Hebrides,\r\ncontaining many open vents. This range or area of elevation separates\r\nthe Coralline Sea from the great chain of atolls on the north between\r\nEllice’s group and the Caroline Islands, so that it lies between two\r\nareas of subsidence.\r\n\r\nThe third and greatest of all the zones of volcanic islands includes\r\nGilolo, one of the Molucca group, which is bristled with volcanic cones;\r\nand from thence it may be traced northwards through the Philippine\r\nIslands and Formosa: bending thence to the north-east, it passes through\r\nLoo-Choo, the Japan Archipelago, and is continued by the Kurile Islands\r\nto the peninsula of Kamtchatka, where there are several volcanos of\r\ngreat elevation.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands and Formosa form the volcanic separation between\r\nthe atoll region in the China Sea, and that of the Caroline and Pellew\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nThere are six islands east of Jephoon in the Japan Archipelago which are\r\nsubject to eruptions, and the internal fire breaks through the Kurile\r\nIslands in 18 vents, besides having raised two new islands in the\r\nbeginning of this century, one 4 miles round, and the other 3000 feet\r\nhigh, though the sea there is so deep that the bottom has not been\r\nreached with a line 200 fathoms long.\r\n\r\nThus, some long rent in the earth had extended from the tropics to the\r\ngelid seas of Okhotsk, probably connected with the peninsula of\r\nKamtchatka: a new one begins to the east of the latter in the Aleutian\r\nIslands, which are of the most barren and desolate aspect, perpetually\r\nbeaten by the surge of a restless ocean, and bristled by the cones of 24\r\nvolcanos; they sweep in a half-moon round Behring’s Sea till they join\r\nthe volcanic peninsula of Russian America.\r\n\r\nThe line of volcanic agency has been followed far beyond the limits of\r\nthe coral-working animals, which extend but a short way on each side of\r\nthe tropics; but it has been shown that in the equatorial regions\r\nimmense areas of elevation alternate with as great areas of subsidence:\r\nnorth of New Holland they are so mixed that it indicates a point of\r\nconvergence.[83]\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Pacific the whole chain of the Andes, and the\r\nadjacent islands of Juan Fernandez and the Galapagos, form a vast\r\nvolcanic area, which is actually now rising; and though there are few\r\nvolcanic islands north of the zone of atolls, yet those that be indicate\r\ngreat internal activity, especially in the Sandwich Islands, where the\r\nvolcanos of Owhyhee [Hawaii] are inferior to none in awful sublimity.\r\nThat of Kirawah is on the flanks of Mowna Roa, which is itself a\r\nvolcano. It was seen in high activity by Mr. Douglas in 1834; he\r\ndescribes it as a deep sunken pit, occupying five square miles, covered\r\nwith masses of lava which had been in a state of recent fusion. In the\r\nmidst of these were two lakes of liquid lava: in both there was a vast\r\ncaldron in furious ebullition, occasionally spouting to the height of\r\nfrom 20 to 70 feet, whence streams of lava, hurrying along in fiery\r\nwaves, were finally precipitated down an ignited arch, where the force\r\nof the lava was partly arrested by the escape of gasses, which threw\r\nback huge blocks, and literally spun them into threads of glass, which\r\nwere carried by the wind like the refuse of a flax-mill. He says the\r\nnoise could hardly be described—that of all the steam-engines in the\r\nworld would be a whisper to it; and the heat was so overpowering, and\r\nthe dryness of the air so intense, that the very eyelids felt scorched\r\nand dried up.[84]\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that, where there are coral fringes, the land is\r\neither rising or stationary; for, were it subsiding, lagoons would be\r\nformed. On the contrary, there are many fringing reefs on the shores of\r\nvolcanic islands along the coasts of the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and\r\nthe West Indian islands, all of which are rising. Indeed, this\r\noccurrence, in numberless instances, coincides with the existence of\r\nupraised organic remains on the land.\r\n\r\nAs the only coral formations in the Atlantic are fringing reefs, and as\r\nthere is not one in its central expanse, except in Bermuda, it may be\r\nconcluded that the bed of the ocean is not sinking; and with the\r\nexception of the Leeward Islands, the Canaries, the Azores, and the Cape\r\nde Verde groups, there are no active volcanos on the islands or on the\r\ncoasts of that ocean.\r\n\r\nAt present the great continent has few centres of volcanic action in\r\ncomparison with what it once had. The Mediterranean is still undermined\r\nby fire, which occasionally finds vent in Vesuvius and the stately cone\r\nof Etna. Though Stromboli constantly pours forth inexhaustible showers\r\nof incandescent matter, and a temporary island now and then starts up\r\nfrom the sea, the volcanic action is diminished, and Italy has become\r\ncomparatively more tranquil.\r\n\r\nThe table-land of Western Asia, especially Azerbijan, had once been the\r\nseat of intense commotion, now spent, as the Seiban Dagh and Ararat, or\r\nonly smoking from the snowy cone of Demavend. The table-land of Eastern\r\nAsia furnishes the solitary instance of igneous explosion at a distance\r\nof 1500 miles from the sea, in the volcanic chain of the Thean-Tchan.\r\n\r\nBesides the two active volcanos of the Pe-shan and Ho-tcheou in the\r\nchain itself, at the distance of 670 miles from each other, with a\r\nsolfatara between them, it is the centre of a most extensive volcanic\r\ndistrict, extending northward to the Altaï Mountains, in which there are\r\nmany points of connection between the interior of the earth and the\r\natmosphere, not by volcanos, but by solfataras, hot springs, and\r\nvapours. In the range of Targatabai, in the country of the Kirghiz,\r\nthere is a mount said to emit smoke and even flame, which produces\r\nsulphur and sal-ammoniac in abundance. It is not ascertained that there\r\nare any mountains in China that eject lava, but there are many\r\nfire-hills and fire-springs; the latter are real Artesian wells five or\r\nsix inches wide, and from 1500 to 3000 feet deep: from some of these\r\nwater rises containing a great quantity of common salt; from others\r\ngases issue; and when a flame is applied, fire rushes out with great\r\nviolence, rising 20 or 30 feet high, with a noise like thunder. The gas,\r\nconducted in tubes of bamboo cane, is used in the evaporation of salt\r\nwater from the neighbouring springs.\r\n\r\nThere are altogether about 270 active volcanos, of which 190 are on the\r\nshores and islands of the Pacific. They are generally disposed in lines\r\nor groups. The chain of the Andes furnishes a magnificent example of\r\nlinear volcanos. The peak of Teneriffe, encompassed by the volcanic\r\nislands of Palma and Lancerote, is an equally good specimen of a central\r\ngroup. Eruptions are much more frequent in low than in high volcanos:\r\nthat in the island of Stromboli is in perpetual activity; whereas\r\nCotopaxi, 18,775 feet high, and Tungaragua in the Andes, have only been\r\nactive once in a hundred years. On account of the force requisite to\r\nraise lava to such great elevations, it rarely flows from very elevated\r\ncones. Antisana is the only instance to the contrary among all the lofty\r\nvolcanos in Quito. In Etna also the pressure is so great that the lava\r\nforces its way through the sides of the mountain or at the base of the\r\ncone.\r\n\r\nAn explosion begins by a dense volume of smoke issuing from the crater,\r\nmixed with aqueous vapour and gases; then masses of rock and molten\r\nmatter in a half-fluid state are ejected with tremendous explosion and\r\nviolence; after which lava begins to flow, and the whole terminates by a\r\nshower of ashes from the crater—often the most formidable part of the\r\nphenomenon, as was experienced at the destruction of Pompeii. There are\r\nseveral volcanos which eject only streams of boiling water, as the\r\nVolcano de Agua in Guatemala; others pour forth boiling mud, as in the\r\nislands of Trinidad, Java, and Cheduba in the Bay of Bengal. A more\r\nfeeble effort of the volcanic force appears in the numerous solfataras.\r\nHot springs show that the volcanic fire is not extinguished, though not\r\notherwise apparent. To these may be added acidulous springs, those of\r\nnaphtha, petroleum, and various kinds of gas, as carbonic acid gas, the\r\nfood of plants—and, when breathed, the destruction of animals, as is\r\nfearfully seen in the Guero Upas, or “Valley of Death,” in Java: it is\r\nhalf a mile in circumference, and about 35 feet deep, with a few large\r\nstones, and not a vestige of vegetation on the bottom, which is covered\r\nwith the skeletons of human beings and the bones of animals and birds\r\nblanched white as ivory. On approaching the edge of the valley, which is\r\nsituate on the top of a hill, a nauseous sickening sensation is felt;\r\nand nothing that has life can enter its precincts without being\r\nimmediately suffocated.[85]\r\n\r\nThe seat of activity has been perpetually changing, but there always has\r\nbeen volcanic action, possibly more intense in former times, but even at\r\npresent it extends from pole to pole.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the numerous volcanic vents in the globe, many places\r\nare subject to violent earthquakes, which ruin the works of man, and\r\noften change the configuration of the country. The most extensive\r\ndistrict of earthquakes comprises the Mediterranean and the adjacent\r\ncountries, Asia Minor, the Caspian Sea, Caucasus, and the Persian\r\nmountains. It joins a vast volcanic district in Central Asia, whose\r\nchief focus seems to be the Thean-Tchan, which includes Lake Baikal and\r\nthe neighbouring regions. A great part of the continent of Asia is more\r\nor less subject to shocks: but, with the exception of the shores of the\r\nRed Sea and the northern parts of Barbary, Africa is entirely free from\r\nthese tremendous scourges; and it is singular that, notwithstanding the\r\nterrible earthquakes which shake the countries west of the Andes, the\r\nAndean chain itself, and all the countries round the Gulf of Mexico and\r\nthe Caribbean Sea, they are extremely rare in the great eastern plains\r\nof South America. For the most part the shocks are transmitted in the\r\nline of the primary mountain-chains, and seem often to be limited by\r\nthem in the other direction.\r\n\r\nThere must be some singular volcanic action underneath part of Great\r\nBritain, which has occasioned 255 slight shocks of earthquake, of which\r\n139 took place in Scotland: the most violent of them have been felt at\r\nComre, in Stratherne; of the rest 14 took place on the borders of\r\nYorkshire and Derbyshire, 30 in Wales, and 31 on the south coast of\r\nEngland: they were preceded by singular phenomena, as a sudden fall of\r\nthe barometer, fogs, and unusual sultriness; the two latter are said to\r\nindicate these convulsions about Siena, and in the Maremma of Tuscany,\r\nwhere they have of late years been attended with very disastrous\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are probably produced by fractures and sudden heavings and\r\nsubsidences in the elastic crust of the globe, from the pressure of the\r\nliquid fire, vapour, and gases in its interior, which there find vent,\r\nrelieve the tension which the strata acquire during their slow\r\nrefrigeration, and restore equilibrium. But whether the initial impulse\r\nbe eruptive, or a sudden pressure upwards, the shock originating in that\r\npoint is propagated through the elastic surface of the earth in a series\r\nof circular or oval undulations, similar to those produced by dropping a\r\nstone into a pool, and like them they become broader and lower as the\r\ndistance increases, till they gradually subside; in this manner the\r\nshock travels through the land, becoming weaker and weaker till it\r\nterminates. When the impulse begins in the interior of a continent, the\r\nelastic wave is propagated through the solid crust of the earth, as well\r\nas in sound through the air, and is transmitted from the former to the\r\nocean, where it is finally spent and lost, or, if very powerful, is\r\ncontinued in the opposite land. Almost all the great earthquakes,\r\nhowever, have their origin in the bed of the ocean, far from land,\r\nwhence the shocks travel in undulations to the surrounding shores.\r\n\r\nNo doubt many of small intensity are imperceptible: it is only the\r\nviolent efforts of the internal forces that can overcome the pressure of\r\nthe ocean’s bed, and that of the superincumbent water. The internal\r\npressure is supposed to find relief most readily in a belt of great\r\nbreadth that surrounds the land at a considerable distance from the\r\ncoast, and being formed of the débris, the internal temperature is in a\r\nperpetual state of fluctuation, which would seem to give rise to sudden\r\nflexures and submarine eruptions.\r\n\r\nWhen the original impulse is a fracture or eruption of lava in the bed\r\nof the deep ocean, two kinds of waves or undulations are produced and\r\npropagated simultaneously—one through the bed of the ocean, which is the\r\ntrue earthquake shock, and coincident with this a wave is formed and\r\npropagated on the surface of the ocean, which rolls to the shore, and\r\nreaches it in time to complete the destruction long after the shock or\r\nwave through the solid ocean-bed has arrived and spent itself on the\r\nland. The sea rose 50 feet at Lisbon and 60 at Cadiz after the great\r\nearthquake; it rose and fell 18 times at Tangier on the coast of Africa,\r\nand 15 times at Funchal in Madeira. At Kinsale in Ireland a body of\r\nwater rushed into the harbour, and the water in Loch Lomond in Scotland\r\nrose two feet four inches—so extensive was the oceanic wave.[86] The\r\nheight to which the surface of the ground is elevated, or the vertical\r\nheight of the shock-wave, varies from one inch to two or three feet.\r\nThis earth-wave, on passing under deep water, is imperceptible, but when\r\nit comes to soundings it carries with it to the land a long, flat,\r\naqueous wave; on arriving at the beach, the water drops in arrear from\r\nthe superior velocity of the shock, so that at that moment the sea seems\r\nto recede before the great ocean-wave arrives.\r\n\r\nIt is the small forced wave that gives the shock to ships, and not the\r\ngreat wave; but when ships are struck in very deep water, the centre of\r\ndisturbance is either immediately under, or very nearly under, the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nThree other series of undulations are formed simultaneously with the\r\npreceding, by which the sound of the explosion is conveyed through the\r\nearth, the ocean, and the air, with different velocities. That through\r\nthe earth travels at the rate of from 7000 to 10,000 feet in a second in\r\nhard rock, and somewhat less in looser materials, and arrives at the\r\ncoast a short time before, or at the same moment with, the shock, and\r\nproduces the hollow sounds that are the harbingers of ruin; then follows\r\na continuous succession of sounds, like the rolling of distant thunder,\r\nformed, first, by the wave that is propagated through the water of the\r\nsea, which travels at the rate of 4700 feet in a second, and, lastly, by\r\nthat passing through the air, which only takes place when the origin of\r\nthe earthquake is a submarine explosion, and travels with a velocity of\r\n1123 feet in a second. The rolling sounds precede the arrival of the\r\ngreat wave on the coasts, and are continued after the terrific\r\ncatastrophe when the eruption is extensive.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a succession of shocks all the phenomena are repeated.\r\nSounds sometimes occur when there is no earthquake: they were heard on\r\nthe plains of the Rio Apure, in Caraccas, at the moment the volcano in\r\nSt. Vincent’s, 700 miles off, discharged a stream of lava. The\r\nbellowings of Guanaxuato afford a singular instance: these subterraneous\r\nnoises have been heard for a month uninterruptedly when there was no\r\nearthquake felt on the table-land of Mexico, nor in the rich\r\nsilver-mines 1600 feet below its surface.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of the great oceanic wave varies as the square root of the\r\ndepth; it consequently has a rapid progress through deep water, and less\r\nwhen it comes to soundings. That raised during the earthquake at Lisbon\r\ntravelled to Barbadoes at the rate of 7·8 miles in a minute, and to\r\nPortsmouth at the rate of a little more than two miles in a minute. The\r\nvelocity of the shock varies with the elasticity of the strata it passes\r\nthrough. The undulations of the earth are subject to the same laws as\r\nthose of light and sound; hence, when the shock or earth-wave passes\r\nthrough strata of different elasticity, it will partly be reflected, and\r\na wave will be sent back, producing a shock in a contrary direction, and\r\npartly refracted, or its course changed, so that shocks will occur both\r\nupwards and downwards, to the right or to the left of the original line\r\nof transit. Hence, most damage is done at the junction of deep alluvial\r\nplains with the hard strata of the mountains, as in the great earthquake\r\nin Calabria in the year 1783.\r\n\r\nWhen the height of the undulations is small, the earthquake will be a\r\nhorizontal motion, which is the least destructive; when the height is\r\ngreat, the central and horizontal motions are combined, and the effect\r\nis terrible. The concussion was upwards in the earthquake which took\r\nplace at Riobamba in 1797. Baron Humboldt mentions that some of the\r\ninhabitants were thrown across a river, several hundred feet in height,\r\non a neighbouring mountain. The worst of all is a vorticose or twisting\r\nmotion, which nothing can resist; it is occasioned by the crossing of\r\ntwo waves of horizontal vibration, which unite at their point of\r\nintersection and form a rotatory movement. This, and the interferences\r\nof shocks arriving at the same point from different origins or routes of\r\ndifferent lengths, account for the repose in some places, and those\r\nextraordinary phenomena that took place during the earthquake of 1783 in\r\nCalabria, where the shock diverged on all sides from a centre through a\r\nhighly elastic base covered with alluvial soil, which was tossed about\r\nin every direction. The dynamics of earthquakes are ably discussed by\r\nMr. Mallet in a very interesting paper in the “Transactions of the Royal\r\nIrish Academy.”\r\n\r\nThere are few places where the earth is long at rest, for, independently\r\nof those secular elevations and subsidences that are in progress over\r\nsuch extensive tracts of country, small earthquake-shocks must be much\r\nmore frequent than we imagine, though imperceptible to our senses, and\r\nonly to be detected by means of instruments. The shock of an earthquake\r\nat Lyons in February, 1822, was not generally perceptible at Paris, yet\r\nthe wave reached and passed under that city, and was detected by the\r\nswinging of the large declination needle at the Observatory, which had\r\npreviously been at rest.\r\n\r\nThe undulations of some of the great earthquakes have spread to an\r\nenormous extent. The earthquake that happened in 1842 in Guadaloupe was\r\nfelt over an extent of 3000 miles in length; and that which destroyed\r\nLisbon had its origin in the bed of the Atlantic, from whence the shock\r\nextended over an area of about 700,000 square miles, or a twelfth part\r\nof the circumference of the globe; the West Indian islands, and the\r\nlakes in Scotland, Norway, and Sweden were agitated by it. In linear\r\ndistance the effects of that earthquake extended through 300 miles, the\r\nshocks were felt through a line of 2700 miles, and the vibrations or\r\ntremors were perceptible in water through 4000 miles. It began without\r\nwarning, and in five minutes the city was a heap of ruins.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake of 1783, in Calabria, which completely changed the face\r\nof the country, only lasted two minutes; but it was not very extensive,\r\nyet all the towns and villages for 22 miles round the small town of\r\nOppido were utterly ruined. The destruction is generally accomplished in\r\na fearfully short time; the earthquake at Caraccas, in March 1812,\r\nconsisted of three shocks, which lasted three or four seconds, separated\r\nby such short intervals that in 50 seconds 10,000 people perished. Baron\r\nHumboldt’s works are full of interesting details on this subject,\r\nespecially with regard to the tremendous convulsions in South America.\r\n\r\nSometimes a shock has been perceived under-ground which was not felt at\r\nthe surface, as in the year 1802, in the silver-mine of Marienberg, in\r\nthe Hartz. In some instances miners have been insensible to shocks felt\r\non the surface above, which happened at Fahlun, in Sweden, in 1823—\r\ncircumstances in both instances depending on the elasticity of the\r\nstrata, the depth of the impulses, or obstacles that may have changed\r\nthe course of the terrestrial undulation. During earthquakes\r\ndislocations of strata take place, the course of rivers is changed, and\r\nin some instances they have been permanently dried up, rocks are hurled\r\ndown, masses raised up, and the configuration of the country altered;\r\nbut if there be no fracture at the point of original impulse, there will\r\nbe no noise.\r\n\r\nThe power of the earthquake in raising and depressing the land has long\r\nbeen well known, but the gradual and almost imperceptible change of\r\nlevel through immense tracts of the globe is altogether a recent\r\ndiscovery; it has been ascribed to the expansion of rocks by heat, and\r\nsubsequent contraction by the retreat of the melted matter from below\r\nthem. It is not at all improbable that there may be motions, like tides,\r\nebbing and flowing in the internal lava, for the changes are by no means\r\nconfined to those enormous elevations and subsidences that appear to be\r\nin progress in the basin of the Pacific and its coasts, nor to the Andes\r\nand the great plains east of them—countries for the most part subject to\r\nearthquakes; they take place, to a vast extent, in regions where these\r\nconvulsions are unknown. There seems to be an extraordinary flexibility\r\nin the crust of the globe from the 54th or 55th parallel of north\r\nlatitude to the Arctic Ocean. There is a line crossing Sweden from east\r\nto west in the parallel of 56° 3ʹ N. lat., along which the ground is\r\nperfectly stable, and has been so for centuries. To the north of it for\r\n1000 miles, between Gottenburg and North Cape, the ground is rising, the\r\nmaximum elevation, which takes place at North Cape, being at the rate of\r\nfive feet in a century, from whence it gradually diminishes to three\r\ninches in a century at Stockholm. South of the line of stability, on the\r\ncontrary, the land is sinking through part of Christianstad and Malmo,\r\nfor the village of Stassten in Scania is now 380 feet nearer to the\r\nBaltic than it was in the time of Linnæus, by whom it was measured 87\r\nyears ago. The coast of Denmark on the sound, the island of Saltholm,\r\nopposite to Copenhagen, and that of Bornholm are rising, the latter at\r\nthe rate of a foot in a century. The coast of Memel on the Baltic has\r\nactually risen a foot and four inches within the last 30 years, while\r\nthe coast of Pillau has sunk down an inch and a half in the same period.\r\nThe west coast of Denmark, part of the Feroe Islands, and the west coast\r\nof Greenland are all being depressed below their former level. In\r\nGreenland, the encroachment of the sea, in consequence of the change of\r\nlevel, has submerged ancient buildings on the low rocky islands, and on\r\nthe main land. The Greenlander never builds near the sea on that\r\naccount, and the Moravian settlers have had to move inland the poles to\r\nwhich they moor their boats. It has been in progress for four centuries,\r\nand extends through 600 miles from Igalito Firth to Disco Bay.[87] Mr.\r\nRobert Chambers has shown that in our own country the land has been for\r\nages on the rise, and that the parallel roads in Glen Roy, which have so\r\nlong afforded matter of discussion, are merely margins left by the\r\nretreat of the water, as the land alternately rose and remained\r\nstationary. In the present day the elevation is going on in many places,\r\nespecially on the Murray Firth and in the Channel islands. The notice of\r\nthis curious subject of the gradual changes of level on the land has\r\nbeen chiefly revived by Sir Charles Lyell, in whose admirable works on\r\ngeology all the details will be found.[88]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nArctic Lands—Greenland—Spitzbergen—Iceland—Its Volcanic Phenomena and\r\n  Geysers—Jan Mayen’s Land—New Siberian Islands—Antarctic Lands—Victoria\r\n  Continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENLAND, the most extensive of the Arctic lands, begins with the lofty\r\npromontory of Cape Farewell, the southern extremity of a group of rocky\r\nislands, which are separated by a channel five miles wide from a\r\ntable-land of appalling aspect, narrow to the south, but increasing in\r\nbreadth northward to a distance of which only 1300 miles are known. This\r\ntable-land is bounded by mountains rising from the deep in mural\r\nprecipices, which terminate in needles and pyramids, or in parallel\r\nterraces, of alternate snow and bare rock, occasionally leaving a narrow\r\nshore. The coating of ice is so continuous and thick that the surface of\r\nthe table-land may be regarded as one enormous glacier, which overlaps\r\nthe rocky edges and dips between the mountain-peaks into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe coasts are beset with rocky islands, and cloven by fiords, which in\r\nsome instances wind like rivers for 100 miles into the interior. These\r\ndeep inlets of the sea, now sparkling in sunshine, now shaded in gloom,\r\nare hemmed in by walls of rock often 2000 feet high, whose summits are\r\nhid in the clouds. They generally terminate in glaciers, which are\r\nsometimes forced on by the pressure of the upper ice-plains till they\r\nfill the fiord, and even project far into the sea like bold headlands,\r\nwhen, undermined by the surge, huge masses of ice fall from them with a\r\ncrash like thunder, making the sea boil. These icebergs, carried by\r\ncurrents, are stranded on the Arctic coast, or are drawn into lower\r\nlatitudes. The ice is very transparent and compact in the Arctic\r\nregions; its prevailing tints are blue, green, and orange, which,\r\ncontrasted with the dazzling whiteness of the snow and the gloomy hue of\r\nthe rocks, produce a striking effect.\r\n\r\nA great fiord in the 68th parallel of latitude is supposed to extend\r\ncompletely across the table-land, dividing the country into south and\r\nnorth Greenland, which last extends indefinitely towards the pole; but\r\nit is altogether inaccessible from the frozen sea and the iron-bound\r\nshore, so that, excepting a very small portion of the coast, it is an\r\nunknown region.\r\n\r\nIn some sheltered spots in south Greenland, especially along the borders\r\nof the fiords, there are meadows where the service-tree bears fruit,\r\nbeech and willow trees grow by the streams, but not taller than a man;\r\nstill farther north the willow and juniper scarcely rise above the\r\nsurface; yet this country has a flora peculiar to itself. South of the\r\nisland of Disco on the west coast, Danish colonies and missionaries have\r\nmade settlements on some of the islands and at the mouths of fiords; the\r\nEsquimaux inhabit the coasts even to the extremity of Baffin’s Bay.\r\n\r\nThe pelasgic islands in the Arctic Ocean are highly volcanic, with the\r\nexception of Spitzbergen. In the island of Spitzbergen the mountains\r\nspring sharp and grand from the margin of the sea in dark gloomy masses,\r\nmixed with pure snow and enormous glaciers, presenting a sublime\r\nspectacle. Seven valleys filled by glaciers ending at the sea form a\r\nremarkable object on the east coast. One of the largest masses of ice\r\nseen by Captain Scoresby on the island was north of Horn Sound: it\r\nextended 11 miles along the shore, with a sea-face in one part more than\r\n2000 feet high, from which he saw a huge fragment hurled into the sea,\r\nwhich it lashed into vapour, as it broke into a thousand pieces. The sun\r\nis not seen for several months in the year, when the intensity of the\r\ncold splits rocks, and makes the sea reek like a boiling caldron. Many\r\nhave perished in the attempt to winter in this island, yet a colony of\r\nRussian hunters and fishermen lead a miserable existence there, within\r\n10° of the pole, the most northern inhabited spot on the globe.\r\n\r\nAlthough the direct rays of the sun are powerful in sheltered spots\r\nwithin the Arctic Circle, the thermometer does not rise above 45° of\r\nFahrenheit. July is the only month in which snow does not fall, and in\r\nthe end of August the sea at night is covered with a thin coating of\r\nice, and a summer often passes without one day that can be called warm.\r\nThe snow-blink, the aurora, the stars, and the moon, which appears ten\r\nor twelve days without intermission in her northern declination, furnish\r\nthe greatest light the inhabitants enjoy in their long winter.\r\n\r\nIceland is 200 miles east from Greenland, and lies south of the Arctic\r\nCircle, which its most northern part touches. Though a fifth part larger\r\nthan Ireland, not more than 4000 square miles are habitable, all beside\r\nbeing a chaos of volcanos and ice.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar feature of Iceland lies in a trachytic region which seems\r\nto rest on an ocean of fire. It consists of two vast parallel\r\ntable-lands covered with ice-clad mountains, stretching from N.E. to\r\nS.W. through the very centre of the island, separated by a longitudinal\r\nvalley nearly 100 miles wide, which reaches from sea to sea. These\r\nmountains assume rounded forms, with long level summits or domes with\r\nsloping declivities, as in the trachytic mountains of the Andes and\r\nelsewhere; but such huge masses of tufa and conglomerate project from\r\ntheir sides in perpendicular or overhanging precipices, separated by\r\ndeep ravines, that the regularity of their structure can only be\r\nperceived from a distance; they conceal under a cold and tranquil\r\ncoating of ice the fiery germs of terrific convulsions, sometimes\r\nbursting into dreadful activity, sometimes quiescent for ages. The most\r\nextensive of the two parallel ranges of Jockuls or Ice Mountains runs\r\nalong the eastern side of the valley, and contains Ordefa, the highest\r\npoint in Iceland, seen like a white cloud from a great distance at sea;\r\nthe western high land passes through the centre of the island.\r\n\r\nGlaciers cover many thousand square miles in Iceland, descending from\r\nthe mountains, and pushing far into the low lands. This tendency of the\r\nice to encroach has very materially diminished the quantity of habitable\r\nground, and the progress of the glaciers is facilitated by the influence\r\nof the ocean of subterranean fire, which heats the superincumbent\r\nground, and loosens the ice.\r\n\r\nThe longitudinal space between the mountainous table-lands is a low\r\nvalley 100 miles wide, extending from sea to sea, where a substratum of\r\ntrachyte is covered with lava, sand, and ashes, studded with low\r\nvolcanic cones. It is a tremendous desert, never approached without\r\ndread even by the natives—a scene of perpetual conflict between the\r\nantagonist powers of fire and frost, without a drop of water or a blade\r\nof grass; no living creature is to be seen—not a bird, nor even an\r\ninsect. The surface is a confused mass of streams of lava rent by\r\ncrevices; and rocks piled on rocks, and occasional glaciers, complete\r\nthe scene of desolation. As herds of reindeer are seen browsing on the\r\nIceland moss that grows plentifully at its edges, it is presumed that\r\nsome unknown parts may be less barren. The extremities of the valley are\r\nmore especially the theatres of perpetual volcanic activity. At the\r\nsouthern end, which opens to the sea in a wide plain, there are many\r\nvolcanos, of which Heckla is most known, from its insulated position,\r\nits vicinity to the coast, and its tremendous eruptions. Between the\r\nyears 1004 and 1766 twenty-three violent eruptions have taken place, one\r\nof which continued six years, spreading devastation over a country once\r\nthe abode of a thriving colony, now covered with lava, scoria, and\r\nashes: in the year 1846 it was in full activity. The eruption of the\r\nSkaptar Jockul, which broke out on the 8th of May, 1783, and continued\r\ntill August, is one of the most dreadful recorded. The volcanic fire\r\nmust have been in fearful commotion under Europe, for a tremendous\r\nearthquake ruined a wide extent of Calabria that year, and a submarine\r\nvolcano had been burning fiercely for many weeks in the ocean, 30 miles\r\nfrom the south-west cape of Iceland. Its fires suddenly ceased, the\r\nisland was shaken by earthquakes, when, at the distance of 150 miles,\r\nthey burst forth with almost unexampled fury in Skaptar. The sun was hid\r\nmany months by dense clouds of vapour, which extended to England and\r\nHolland, and clouds of ashes were carried many hundreds of miles to sea.\r\nThe quantity of matter thrown out in this eruption was computed at fifty\r\nor sixty thousand millions of cubic yards. The lava flowed in a stream\r\nin some places from 20 to 30 miles broad, and of enormous thickness,\r\nwhich filled the beds of rivers, poured into the sea nearly 50 miles\r\nfrom the places of its eruption, and destroyed the fishing on the coast.\r\nSome rivers were heated to ebullition, others dried up; the condensed\r\nvapour fell in snow and torrents of rain; the country was laid waste;\r\nfamine and disease ensued; and in the course of the two succeeding years\r\n1300 people and 150,000 sheep and horses perished. The scene of horror\r\nwas closed by a dreadful earthquake. Previous to the explosion an\r\nominous mildness of temperature indicated the approach of the volcanic\r\nfire towards the surface of the earth; similar warnings had been\r\nobserved before in the eruptions of Heckla.\r\n\r\nA semicircle of volcanic mountains on the eastern side of the Lake\r\nMyvatr is the focus of the igneous phenomena at the northern end of the\r\ngreat central valley. Leirhnukr and Krabla, on the N.E. of the lake,\r\nhave been equally formidable. After years of quiescence they suddenly\r\nburst into violent eruption, and poured such a quantity of lava into the\r\nlake Myvatr, which is 20 miles in circumference, that the water boiled\r\nmany days. There are other volcanos in this district no less formidable.\r\nVarious caldrons of boiling mineral pitch, the shattered craters of\r\nancient volcanos, occur at the base of this semicircle of mountains, and\r\nalso on the flanks of Mount Krabla: these caldrons throw up jets of the\r\ndark matter, enveloped in clouds of steam, at regular intervals, with\r\nloud explosion. That which issues from the crater of Krabla must, by Mr.\r\nHenderson’s description, be one of the most terrific objects in nature.\r\n\r\nThe eruptive boiling springs of Iceland are perhaps the most\r\nextraordinary phenomena in this singular country. All the great aqueous\r\neruptions occur in the trachytic formation; they are characterized by\r\ntheir high temperature, by holding siliceous matter in solution, which\r\nthey deposit in the form of siliceous sinter, and by the discharge of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen gas. Numerous instances of spouting springs occur\r\nat the extremities of the great central valley, especially at its\r\nsouthern end, where more than fifty have been counted in the space of a\r\nfew acres—some constant, others periodical—some merely agitated, or\r\nstagnant. The Great Geyser and Strokr, 35 miles north-west from Heckla,\r\nare the most magnificent; at regular intervals they project large\r\ncolumns of boiling water 100 feet high, enveloped in clouds of steam,\r\nwith tremendous noise. The tube of the Great Geyser whence the jet\r\nissues is about 10 feet in diameter and 75 feet deep; it opens into the\r\ncentre of a basin 4 feet deep and between 46 and 50 feet in diameter: as\r\nsoon as the basin is filled by the boiling water that rises through the\r\ntube, explosions are heard, the ground trembles, the water is thrown to\r\nthe height of 100 or 150 feet, followed by large volumes of steam. No\r\nfarther explosion takes place till the empty basin and tube are again\r\nreplenished.\r\n\r\nMM. Descloiseaux and Bunsen, who visited Iceland in 1846, found the\r\ntemperature of the Great Geyser, at the depth of 72 feet, before a great\r\neruption, to be 260-1/2° of Fahrenheit, and after the eruption 251-1/2°;\r\nan interval of 28 hours passed without any eruption. The Strokr (from\r\nstroka, to agitate), 140 yards from the Great Geyser, is a circular\r\nwell, a little more than 44 feet deep, with an orifice of 8 feet, which\r\ndiminishes to little more than 10 inches at a depth of 27 feet. The\r\nsurface of the water is in constant ebullition, while at the bottom the\r\ntemperature exceeds that of boiling water by about 24°. By the\r\nexperiments of M. Donny of Ghent, water long boiled becomes more and\r\nmore free from air, by which the cohesion of the particles is so much\r\nincreased that when it is exposed to a heat sufficient to overcome the\r\nforce of cohesion, the production of steam is so instantaneous and so\r\nconsiderable as to cause explosion. To this cause he ascribes the\r\neruptions of the Geysers, which are in constant ebullition for many\r\nhours, and become so purified from air, that the strong heat at the\r\nbottom at last overcomes the cohesion of the particles, and an explosion\r\ntakes place. The boiling spring of Tunquhaer, in the valley of Reikholt,\r\nis remarkable from having two jets, which play alternately for about\r\nfour minutes each. Some springs emit gas only, or gas with a small\r\nquantity of water. Such fountains are not confined to the land or fields\r\nof ice; they occur also in the sea, and many issue from the crevices in\r\nthe lava-bed of Lake Myvatr, and rise in jets above the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nA region of the same character with the mountains of the Icelandic\r\ndesert extends due west from it to the extremity of the long narrow\r\npromontory of the Sneefield Syssel, ending in the snow-clad cone of the\r\nSneefield Jockul, 5000 feet high, one of the most conspicuous mountains\r\nin Iceland.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the purely volcanic districts described,\r\ntrap-rocks cover a great part of Iceland, which have been formed by\r\nstreams of lava at very ancient epochs, occasionally 4000 feet deep.\r\n\r\nThe dismal coasts are torn in every direction by fiords, penetrating\r\nmany miles into the interior, and splitting into endless branches, in\r\nthese fissures the sea is still, dark, and deep, between walls of rock\r\n1000 feet high. The fiords, however, do not here, as in Greenland,\r\nterminate in glaciers, but are prolonged in narrow valleys, through\r\nwhich streams and rivers run to the sea. In these valleys the\r\ninhabitants have their abode, or in meadows which have a transient\r\nverdure along some of the fiords, where the sea is so deep that ships\r\nfind safe anchorage.\r\n\r\nIn the valleys on the northern coast, near as they approach to the\r\nArctic Circle, the soil is wonderfully good, and there is more\r\nvegetation than in any other part of Iceland, with the exception of the\r\neastern shore, which is the most favoured portion of this desolate land.\r\nRivers abounding in fish are much more frequent there than elsewhere;\r\nwillows and juniper adorn the valleys, and birch-trees, 20 feet high,\r\ngrow in the vale of Lagerflest, the only place which produces them large\r\nenough for house-building, and the verdure is fine on the banks of those\r\nstreams which are heated by volcanic fires.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Iceland is much less rigorous than that of Greenland, and\r\nit would be still milder were not the air chilled by the immense fields\r\nof ice from the Polar Sea which beset its shores.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are supplied with fuel by the Gulf Stream, which brings\r\ndrift-wood in great quantities from Mexico, the Carolinas, Virginia, the\r\nriver St. Lawrence, and some even from the Pacific Ocean is drifted by\r\ncurrents round by the northern shores of Siberia. The mean temperature\r\nin the south of the island is about 39° of Fahrenheit, that of the\r\ncentral districts 36°, and in the north it is rarely above the freezing\r\npoint. The cold is most intense when the sky is clear, but that is a\r\nrare occurrence, as the wind from the sea covers mountain and valley\r\nwith thick fog. Hurricanes are frequent and furious; and although\r\nthunder is seldom heard in high latitudes, Iceland is an exception, for\r\ntremendous thunder-storms are not uncommon there—a circumstance no doubt\r\nowing to the volcanic nature of that island, as lightning accompanies\r\nvolcanic eruptions everywhere. At the northern end of the island the sun\r\nis always above the horizon in the middle of summer, and under it in\r\nmid-winter, yet there is no absolute darkness.\r\n\r\nThe island of Jan Mayen lies midway between Iceland and Spitzbergen; it\r\nis the most northern volcanic country known. Its principal feature is\r\nthe volcano of Beerenberg, 6870 feet high, whose lofty snow-capped cone,\r\napparently inaccessible, has been seen to emit fire and smoke. It is\r\nflanked by enormous glaciers, like frozen cataracts, which occupy three\r\nhollows in an almost perpendicular cliff, which descends from the base\r\nof the mountain to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe group of New Siberian Islands, which lie north of the province of\r\nYakutsk, and in about 78° of N. lat., have so rude a climate that they\r\nhave no permanent inhabitants; they are remarkable for the vast quantity\r\nof fossil bones they contain: the elephant’s tusks found there have for\r\nyears been an article of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe south polar lands are equally volcanic, and as deeply ice-bound, as\r\nthose to the north. Victoria Land, which from its extent seems to form\r\npart of a continent, was discovered by Sir James Ross, who commanded the\r\nexpedition sent by the British government in 1839 to ascertain the\r\nposition of the south magnetic pole. This extensive tract lies under the\r\nmeridian of New Zealand; Cape North, its most northern point, is situate\r\nin 70° 31ʹ S. lat., and 165° 28ʹ E. long. To the west of that cape the\r\nnorthern coast of this new land terminates in perpendicular ice-cliffs,\r\nfrom 200 to 500 feet high, stretching as far as the eye can reach, with\r\na chain of grounded icebergs extending for miles from the base of the\r\ncliffs, all of tabular form, and varying in size from one to nine or ten\r\nmiles in circumference. A lofty range of peaked mountains rises in the\r\ninterior at Cape North, covered with unbroken snow, only relieved from\r\nuniform whiteness by shadows produced by the undulations of the surface.\r\nThe indentations of the coast are filled with ice many hundreds of feet\r\nthick, which makes it impossible to land. To the east of Cape North the\r\ncoast trends first to S.E. by E. and then in a southerly direction to\r\n78-1/4° of S. lat., at which point it suddenly bends to the east, and\r\nextends in one continuous vertical ice-cliff to an unknown distance in\r\nthat direction. The first view of Victoria Land is described as most\r\nmagnificent. “On the 11th of January, 1841, in about latitude 71° S. and\r\nlongitude 171° E., the Antarctic continent was first seen, the general\r\noutline of which at once indicated its volcanic character, rising\r\nsteeply from the ocean in a stupendous mountain-range, peak above peak\r\nenveloped in perpetual snow, and clustered together in countless groups\r\nresembling a vast mass of crystallization, which, as the sun’s rays were\r\nreflected on it, exhibited a scene of such unequalled magnificence and\r\nsplendour as would baffle all power of language to portray, or give the\r\nfaintest conception of. One very remarkable peak, in shape like a huge\r\ncrystal of quartz, rose to the height of 7867 feet, another to 9096, and\r\na third to 8444 feet above the level of the sea. From these peaks ridges\r\ndescended to the coast, terminating abruptly in bold capes and\r\npromontories, whose steep escarpments, affording shelter to neither ice\r\nnor snow, alone showed the jet black lava or basalt, which reposed\r\nbeneath the mantle of eternal frost.”... “On the 28th, in lat. 77° 31ʹ\r\nand long. 167° 1ʹ, the burning volcano, Mount Erebus, was discovered,\r\ncovered with ice and snow from its base to its summit, from which a\r\ndense column of black smoke towered high above the other numerous lofty\r\ncones and crateriferous peaks with which this extraordinary land is\r\nstudded from the 72d to the 78th degree of latitude. Its height above\r\nthe sea is 12,367 feet, and Mount Terror, an extinct crater near to it,\r\nwhich has doubtless once given vent to fires beneath, attains an\r\naltitude little inferior, being 10,884 feet in height, and ending in a\r\ncape, from which a vast barrier of ice extended in an easterly\r\ndirection, checking all farther progress south. This continuous\r\nperpendicular wall of ice, varying in height from 200 to 100 feet, its\r\nsummit presenting an almost unvarying level outline, we traced for 300\r\nmiles, when the pack-ice obstructed all farther progress.”[89]\r\n\r\nThe vertical cliff in question forms a completely solid mass of ice\r\nabout 1000 feet thick, the greater part of which is below the surface of\r\nthe sea; there is not the smallest appearance of a fissure throughout\r\nits whole extent, and the intensely blue sky beyond indicated plainly\r\nthe great distance to which the ice-plains reach southward. Gigantic\r\nicicles hang from every projecting point of the icy cliff, showing that\r\nit sometimes thaws in these latitudes, although in the month of\r\nFebruary, which corresponds with August in England, Fahrenheit’s\r\nthermometer did not rise above 14° at noon. In the North Polar Ocean, on\r\nthe contrary, streams of water flow from every iceberg during the\r\nsummer. The whole of this country is beyond the pale of vegetation: no\r\nmoss, not even a lichen, covers the barren soil where everlasting winter\r\nreigns. Parry’s Mountains, a lofty range, stretching south from Mount\r\nTerror to the 79th parallel, is the most southern land yet discovered.\r\nThe South Magnetic Pole, one of the objects of the expedition, is\r\nsituate in Victoria Land, in 75° 5ʹ S. lat., and 154° 8ʹ E. long.,\r\naccording to Sir James C. Ross’s observations.\r\n\r\nVarious tracts of land have been discovered near the Antarctic Circle,\r\nand within it, though none in so high a latitude as Victoria Land.\r\nWhether they form part of one large continent remains to be ascertained.\r\nDiscovery ships sent by the Russian, French, and American governments\r\nhave increased our knowledge of these remote regions, and the spirited\r\nadventures of British merchants and captains of whalers have contributed\r\nquite as much.[90] The land within the Antarctic Circle is generally\r\nvolcanic, at least the coast-line, which is all that is yet known, and\r\nthat, being covered with snow and ice, is destitute of vegetation. [The\r\nland described by Sir James Ross as Victoria Land, was, in fact,\r\ndiscovered by the U. S. Exploring Expedition, under the command of\r\nCharles Wilkes, Esq., U. S. Navy. He says:—“That land does exist within\r\nthe Antarctic Circle is now confirmed by the united testimony of both\r\nFrench and English navigators. D’Urville, the celebrated French\r\nnavigator, _within a few days after land was seen by the three vessels\r\nof our squadron_, reports that his boats landed on a small point of\r\nrocks, at the place (as I suppose) which appeared accessible to us in\r\nPiner’s Bay, whence the Vincennes was driven by a violent gale; this he\r\ncalled Clarie Land, and testifies to his belief of the existence of a\r\nvast tract of land, where our view of it has left no doubt of its\r\nexistence. Ross, on the other hand, penetrated to the latitude of 79° S.\r\nin the succeeding year, coasted for some distance along a lofty country\r\nconnected with our Antarctic Continent, and establishes beyond all cavil\r\nthe correctness of our assertion that we have discovered, not a range of\r\ndetached islands, but a vast Antarctic Continent. How far Captain Ross\r\nwas guided in his search by our previous discoveries will best appear by\r\nreference to the chart, with a full account of the proceedings of the\r\nsquadron, which I sent to him, and which I have inserted in Appendix\r\nXXIV., and Atlas. Although I have never received any acknowledgment of\r\ntheir receipt from him personally, yet I have heard of their having\r\nreached his hands a few months prior to his Antarctic cruise.”]—\r\n_Wilkes’s “Narrative of the U. S. Exploring Expedition,”_ vol. ii., p.\r\n281-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nNature and Character of Mineral Veins—Metalliferous Deposits—Mines—Their\r\n  Drainage and Ventilation—Their Depth—Diffusion of the Metals—Gold—\r\n  Silver—Lead—British Mines—Quicksilver—Copper—Tin—Cornish Mines—Coal—\r\n  Iron—Most abundant in the Temperate Zones, especially in the Northern—\r\n  European and British Iron and Coal—American Iron and Coal—Arsenic and\r\n  other Metals—Salt—Sulphur—Diffusion of the Gems.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE tumultuous and sudden action of the volcano and the earthquake on\r\nthe great masses of the earth is in strong contrast with the calm,\r\nsilent operations on the minute atoms of matter by which Nature seems to\r\nhave filled the fissures in the rocks with her precious gifts of metals\r\nand minerals, sought for by man from the earliest ages to the present\r\nday. Tubal-cain was “the instructor of every artificer in brass and\r\niron.” Gold was among the first luxuries, and even in our own country,\r\nfrom time immemorial, strangers came from afar to carry off the produce\r\nof the Cornish mines.[91]\r\n\r\nThe ancients scarcely were acquainted with a third of the thirty-five\r\nmetals now known, and the metallic bases of the alkalis only date from\r\nthe time of Sir Humphry Davy, having formed a remarkable part of his\r\nbrilliant discoveries.[92]\r\n\r\nMinerals are deposited in veins or fissures of rocks, in masses, in\r\nbeds, and sometimes in gravel and sand, the detritus of water. Most of\r\nthe metals are found in veins; a few, as gold and tin, iron and copper,\r\nare disseminated through the rocks, though rarely. Veins are cracks or\r\nfissures in rocks, seldom in a straight line, yet they maintain a\r\ngeneral direction, though in a zigzag form, striking downwards at a very\r\nhigh angle, seldom deviating from the perpendicular by so much as\r\nforty-five degrees, and extending to an unfathomable depth. They are for\r\nthe most part accompanied by a subsidence of the strata on one side of\r\ntheir course, and by an elevation on the other; the throw, or\r\nperpendicular distance between the corresponding strata on the opposite\r\nsides of a vein, varies from a few inches to thirty, forty, even a\r\nhundred fathoms. The beginning or end of a vein is scarcely ever known;\r\nbut, when explored, they are found to begin abruptly, and, after\r\ncontinuing entire to a greater or less distance, they branch into small\r\nveins or strings.\r\n\r\nIn the downward zigzag course of a vein, the bending of the strata\r\nupwards on one side and downwards on the other, and the chemical changes\r\nalmost always observed on the adjacent rocks, veins bear a strong\r\nanalogy to the course and effects of a very powerful electrical\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nVeins have been filled with substances foreign to them, which have\r\nprobably been disseminated in atoms in the adjacent rocks or by\r\nsublimation. Nothing can be more certain than that the minute particles\r\nof matter are constantly in motion from the action of heat, mutual\r\nattraction, and electricity. Prismatic crystals of salts of zinc are\r\nchanged in a few seconds into crystals of a totally different form by\r\nthe heat of the sun: casts of shells are found in rocks, from which the\r\nanimal matter has been removed, and its place supplied by mineral\r\nmatter; and the excavations made in rocks diminish sensibly in size in a\r\nshort time if the rock be soft, and in a longer time when it is hard—\r\ncircumstances which show an intestine motion of the particles, not only\r\nin their relative positions, but in space, which there is every reason\r\nto believe is owing to electricity—a power which, if not the sole agent,\r\nmust at least have co-operated essentially in the formation and filling\r\nof mineral veins.[93]\r\n\r\nThe magnetism of the earth is presumed to be owing to electrical\r\ncurrents circulating through its surface in a direction at right angles\r\nto the magnetic meridians. Mr. Fox, so well known in the scientific\r\nworld, has long since shown, from observations in the Cornish mines,\r\nthat such currents do flow through all metallic veins. Now, as the\r\ndifferent substances of which the earth is composed are in different\r\nstates of electro-magnetism, and are often interrupted by non-conducting\r\nrocks, the electric currents, being stopped in their course, act\r\nchemically on all the liquids and substances they meet with. Hence, Mr.\r\nFox has come to the conclusion that not only the nature of the deposits\r\nmust have been determined by their relative electrical conditions, but\r\nthat the direction of the metallic veins themselves must have been\r\ninfluenced by the direction of the magnetic meridians; and, in fact,\r\nalmost all the metallic deposits in the world are in parallel veins or\r\nfissures tending from east to west, or from north-east to south-west.\r\nVeins at right angles to these are generally non-metalliferous, and, if\r\nthey do contain metallic ores, they are of a different kind. In some few\r\ncases both contain the same ore, but in very different quantities, as in\r\nthe silver-mine at Pasco, in the Andes, and both veins are richer near\r\nthe point of crossing than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSir Henry de la Beche conceives that the continued expansion and\r\nelevation of an intensely heated mass from below would occasion numerous\r\nvertical fissures through the superincumbent strata, within which some\r\nmineral matters may have been drawn up by sublimation, and others\r\ndeposited in them when held in solution by ascending and descending\r\nstreams of water; but even on this hypothesis the direction of the rents\r\nand the deposition of the minerals would be influenced by the electrical\r\ncurrents. But if veins were filled from below, the richest veins would\r\nbe lowest, which is not the case in Cornwall, Mexico, or Peru.[94] The\r\nprimum mobile of the whole probably lies far beyond our globe: we must\r\nlook to the sun’s heat, if not as the sole cause of electrical currents,\r\nat least as combined with the earth’s rotation in their evolution.[95]\r\n\r\nWhen veins cross one another, the traversed veins are presumed to be of\r\nprior formation to those traversing, because the latter are dislocated\r\nand often heaved out of their course at the point of meeting; and such\r\nis the case with the metalliferous veins, which are therefore the most\r\nrecent. Veins are rarely filled in every part with ore; they contain\r\nsparry and stony matter, called its matrix, with here and there\r\nirregular masses of the metallic ores, often of great size and value.\r\nSolitary veins are generally unproductive, and veins are richer when\r\nnear one another. The prevalence and richness of mineral veins are\r\nintimately connected with the proximity or junction of dissimilar rocks,\r\nwhere the electro-molecular and electro-chemical actions are most\r\nenergetic. Granite, porphyry, and the plutonic rocks are often eminently\r\nmetalliferous; but mineral deposits are also abundant in rocks of\r\nsedimentary origin, especially in and near situations where these two\r\nclasses of rocks are in contact with one another, or where the\r\nmetamorphic structure has been induced upon the sedimentary. This is\r\nremarkably the case in Cornwall, the north of England, in the Ural, and\r\nall the great mining districts.\r\n\r\nThe metalliferous deposits are peculiar to particular rocks: gold and\r\ntin are most plentiful in granite and the rocks lying immediately above\r\nit; copper is deposited in various slate formations resting on the\r\npreceding, and in the trias; lead is found in the mountain-limestone\r\nsystem, and is rare where iron and copper abound; iron abounds in the\r\ncoal and oolitic strata, and in a state of oxidule and carbonate in the\r\nolder rocks; and silver is found in almost all of these formations; its\r\nores being frequently combined with those of other metals, especially of\r\nlead and copper. There is such a connection between the contents of a\r\nvein and the nature of the rock in which the fissure is, that, when in\r\nthe oldest rocks the same vein intersects clay-slate and granite, the\r\ncontents of the parts enclosed in one rock differ very much from what is\r\nfound in the other. It is believed that in the strata lying above the\r\ncoal-measures none of the more precious metals have been found in\r\nEngland in such plenty as to defray the expense of raising them,\r\nalthough such a rule does not extend to the continent of Europe or to\r\nSouth America, where copper and silver ores abound in our new red\r\nsandstone series. In Great Britain no metal is raised in any stratum\r\nnewer than the magnesian limestone. Metals exist chiefly in the primary\r\nand early secondary strata, especially near the junction of the granite\r\nand slates; and it is a fact that rich veins of lead, copper, tin, &c.,\r\nabound only in and near the districts which have been greatly shaken by\r\nsubterraneous movements. In other countries, as Auvergne and the\r\nPyrenees, the presence of igneous rocks may have caused mineral veins to\r\nappear in more recent strata than those which contain them in Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nWhen a mine is opened, a shaft like a well is sunk perpendicularly from\r\nthe surface of the ground, and from it horizontal galleries are dug at\r\ndifferent levels according to the direction of the metallic veins, and\r\ngunpowder is used to blast the rocks when too hard for the pickaxe. When\r\nmines extend very far in a horizontal direction, it becomes necessary to\r\nsink more shafts, for ventilation as well as for facility in raising the\r\nore. Such is the perfection of underground surveying in England, that\r\nthe work can be carried on at the same time from above and below so\r\nexactly as to meet; and in order to accelerate the operation, the shaft\r\nis worked simultaneously from the different galleries or levels of the\r\nmine. In this manner a perpendicular shaft was sunk 204 fathoms deep,\r\nabout nineteen years ago, in the Consolidated mines in Cornwall; it was\r\nfinished in twelve months, having been worked in fifteen different\r\npoints at once. In that mine there are ninety-five shafts, besides other\r\nperpendicular communications under-ground from level to level: the depth\r\nof the whole of these shafts added together amounts to about 25 miles;\r\nthe galleries and levels extend horizontally about 43 miles, and 2500\r\npeople are employed in it: yet this is but one of many mines now in\r\noperation in the mining district of Cornwall alone.[96]\r\n\r\nThe infiltration of the rain and surface-water, together with\r\nsubterranean springs and pools, would soon inundate a mine and put a\r\nstop to the work, were not adequate means employed to remove it. The\r\nsteam-engine is often the only way of accomplishing what in many cases\r\nwould otherwise be impossible, and the produce of mines has been in\r\nproportion to the successive improvements in that machine. In the\r\nConsolidated mines already mentioned there are nine steam-engines\r\nconstantly pumping out the water; four of these, which are the largest\r\never made, together lift from thirty to fifty hogsheads of water per\r\nminute, from an average depth of 230 fathoms. The power of the\r\nsteam-engines in draining the Cornish mines is equal to 44,000 horses—\r\none-sixth of a bushel of coals performing the work of a horse. The\r\nlargest engine is between 300 and 350 horse-power; but as horses must\r\nrest, and the engine works incessantly, it would require 1000 horses to\r\ndo its work.[97]\r\n\r\nMines in high ground are sometimes drained to a certain depth by an adit\r\nor gallery dug from the bottom of a shaft in a sloping direction to a\r\nneighbouring valley. One of these adits extends through the large mining\r\ndistrict of Gwennap, in Cornwall; it begins in a valley near the sea,\r\nand very little above its level, and goes through all the neighbouring\r\nmines, which it drains to that depth, and with all its ramifications is\r\n30 miles long. Nent Force Level, in the north of England, forms a\r\nsimilar drain to the mines in Alston Moor: it is a stupendous aqueduct 9\r\nfeet broad, and in some places from 16 to 20 feet high; it passes for\r\nmore than 3 miles under the course of the river Nent to Nentsbury\r\nengine-shaft, and is navigated underground by long narrow boats.\r\nDaylight at its mouth is seen like a star at the distance of a mile in\r\nthe interior. Most of the adits admit of the passage of men and horses,\r\nwith rails at the sides for wagons.\r\n\r\nThe ventilation of mines is accomplished by burning fires in some of the\r\nshafts, which are in communication with the others, so that currents of\r\nair flow up one and down the others. In some cases fresh air is carried\r\ninto the mines by streams that are made to flow down some of the shafts.\r\nWere this not done, the heat, which increases with the depth, would be\r\ninsupportable; ventilation diminishes the danger from the fire-damp,\r\nfor, even where Sir Humphry Davy’s safety-lamp is used, accidents happen\r\nfrom the carelessness of the miners.[98]\r\n\r\nThe access to deep mines, as in Cornwall, is by a series of\r\nperpendicular or slightly inclined ladders, sometimes uninterrupted, but\r\ngenerally broken at intervals by resting-places. It is computed that\r\none-third of a miner’s physical strength was exhausted in ascending and\r\ndescending a deep mine: they are now drawn up by the steam-engine.\r\n\r\nThe greatest depth to which man has excavated is nothing when compared\r\nwith the radius of the earth. The Eselschacht mine at Kuttenberg in\r\nBohemia, now inaccessible, which is 3778 feet below the surface, is\r\ndeeper than any other mine. Its depth is only 150 feet less than the\r\nheight of Vesuvius, and it is eight times greater than the height of the\r\npyramid of Cheopos, or the cathedral of Strasburg. The Monkwearmouth\r\ncoal-mine near Sunderland, descends to 1500 feet below the level of the\r\nsea, so that the barometer stands there at 31·80, which is higher than\r\nanywhere on the earth’s surface.[99] The salt-works of New Saltzwerk in\r\nPrussia are 2231 feet deep, and 1993 feet below the level of the sea;\r\nand various other mines, such as the Liege coal-mine of Esperance, and\r\nthat of Mont Massi, in the Maremma of Tuscany, do the same. Mines on\r\nhigh ground may be very deep without extending to the sea-level: that of\r\nValenciana, near Guanaxuato in Mexico, is 1686 feet deep, yet its bottom\r\nis 5960 feet above the surface of the sea; and the mines in the higher\r\nAndes must be much more. For the same reason the rich mine of\r\nJoachimsthal in Bohemia, 2120 feet deep, has not yet reached that level.\r\nThe fire-springs at Tseu-lieu-tsing in China are 3197 feet deep, but\r\ntheir relative depth is unknown.[100] How insignificant are all the\r\nworks of man compared with nature!—A line 27,600 feet long did not reach\r\nthe bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe metals are very profusely diffused over the earth. Few countries of\r\nany extent do not contain some of them. A small number occur pure, but\r\nin general they are in the form of ores, in which the metal is\r\nchemically combined with other substances, and the ore is often so mixed\r\nwith earthy matter and rock that it is necessary to reduce it to a\r\ncoarse powder in order to separate the ore, which is rarely more than a\r\nthird or fourth part of the mass brought above ground.\r\n\r\nGold is found in almost every country, but in such minute quantities\r\nthat it is often not worth the expense of working. It is almost always\r\nin a native state, and in the form of crystals, grains, or rolled\r\nmasses. Sometimes it is combined with silver. It is exhausted in several\r\nparts of Europe where it was formerly found. The united produce of the\r\nmines in Transylvania, Hungary, the north-western districts of Austria,\r\nand the bed of the Danube, is nearly 60,000 ounces annually. Gold is\r\nfound in small quantities in Spain, in the lead-hills in Scotland, and\r\nthe Wicklow mountains in Ireland.\r\n\r\nGold abounds in Asia, especially in Siberia. The deposits at the foot of\r\nthe Ural mountains are very rich. In 1826 a piece of pure gold weighing\r\n23 pounds was found there, along with others weighing three or four\r\npounds each, together with the bones of elephants. All the diluvium\r\nthere is ferruginous; and more to the east, as already mentioned, a\r\nregion as large as France has lately been discovered with a soil rich in\r\ngold-dust, resting on rocks filled with it. In 1834 the treasures in\r\nthat part of the Altaï chain called the Gold Mountains were discovered,\r\nforming a mountain-knot nearly as large as England, from which a great\r\nquantity of gold has been extracted. Gold is found in Tibet, in the\r\nChinese province of Yun-nan, and abundantly in the mountains of the\r\nIndo-Chinese peninsula, in Japan, and Borneo. In the latter island it\r\noccurs near the surface in six different places.\r\n\r\nAfrica has long furnished a large supply to Europe. That part of the\r\nKong Mountains west of the meridian of Greenwich is one of the most\r\nauriferous regions in the world. The gold stratum lies from 20 to 25\r\nfeet below the surface, and increases in richness with the depth. It is\r\nfound in particles and pieces in a reddish sand. Most of the streams\r\nfrom the table-land bring down gold, as well those that descend to the\r\nlow ground to the north, as those that flow to the Atlantic. On the\r\nshores of the Red Sea it was found in sufficient quantity to induce the\r\nPortuguese to form a settlement there.\r\n\r\nIn South America, the western Cordillera is poor in metals except in New\r\nGrenada, where the most westerly of the three chains of the Andes is\r\nrich in gold and platinum—a metal found only there, in Brazil, and on\r\nthe European side of the Ural mountains—in alluvial deposits. The\r\nlargest piece of platinum that has been found weighed 21 ounces. Gold is\r\nfound in sand and gravel on the high plains of the Andes, on the low\r\nlands to the east of them, and in almost all the rivers that flow on\r\nthat side. The whole country between Jaen de Bracamores and the Guaviare\r\nis celebrated for its metallic riches. Almost all the Brazilian rivers\r\nbring down gold; and the mine of Gongo Socco, near Rio de Janeiro, is\r\nsaid to yield several varieties of gold-ore. Central America, Mexico,\r\nand California are auriferous countries. The quantity of gold recently\r\nfound near the surface in California is very great. [There is no\r\ndefinite statement of the amount.] A considerable quantity is found in\r\nTennessee, the mountains of Georgia, and on 1000 square miles of North\r\nCarolina it occurs in grains and masses.\r\n\r\nA great deal of silver is raised in Europe. The mines of Hungary are the\r\nmost productive, especially those in the mountains of Chemnitz. The\r\nmetalliferous mountains of the Erzgebirge are also very rich, as also\r\nthe mines near Christiania in Sweden. Silver is also found in Saxony,\r\nTransylvania, and Austria. In no part of the old continent is silver in\r\ngreater abundance than in the Ural and Altaï mountains, especially in\r\nthe district of Kolywan. There are silver-mines in Armenia, Anatolia,\r\nTibet, China, Cochin-China, and Japan.\r\n\r\nThe richness of the Andes in silver can hardly be conceived, but the\r\nmines are frequently on such high ground that the profits are diminished\r\nby the difficulty of carriage, the expense of living in a barren\r\ncountry, sometimes destitute of water, where the miners suffer from the\r\ncold and snow, and especially the want of fuel. This is particularly the\r\ncase at the silver-mines of Copiapo in Chile, where the country is\r\nutterly barren, and not a drop of water is to be found in a circuit of\r\nnine miles. These mines were discovered by a poor man in 1832, who hit\r\nupon a mass of silver in rooting out a tree. They extend over 150 square\r\nleagues. Sixteen veins of silver were found in the first four days, and,\r\nbefore three weeks elapsed, forty more, not reckoning smaller\r\nramifications, were discovered. The rolled pieces which lay on the\r\nsurface produced a large quantity of pure silver. A single mass weighed\r\n5000 pounds.[101]\r\n\r\nIn Peru there are silver-mines along the whole range of the Andes, from\r\nCaxamarea to the confines of the desert of Atacama. The richest at\r\npresent are those of Pasco, which were discovered by an Indian in 1630.\r\nThey have been worked without interruption since the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, and seem to be still inexhaustible. The soil under\r\nthe town of Pasco is metalliferous, the ores probably forming a series\r\nof beds contemporaneous with the strata. The richness of these beds is\r\nnot everywhere the same, but the nests of ore are numerous. The mines of\r\nPotosi, 16,150 feet above the sea-level, are celebrated for riches, but\r\nthe owners have to contend with all the difficulties which such a\r\nsituation imposes. The small depth at which the silver lies on the high\r\nplains of the Andes, and the quantity of it on the surface, is probably\r\nowing, as has been already stated, to the greater deposition of the\r\nsublimed mineral from refrigeration near the surface. The ore in the\r\nmines at Chota is near the surface over an extent of half a square\r\nleague, and the filaments of silver are sometimes even entwined with the\r\nroots of the grass. This mine is 13,300 feet above the level of the sea,\r\nand even in summer the thermometer is below the freezing-point in the\r\nnight. In the district of Huantajaya, not far from the borders of the\r\nPacific, there are mines where masses of pure silver are found, of which\r\none weighed 800 pounds.[102]\r\n\r\nAccording to Baron Humboldt, the quantity of the precious metals brought\r\nto Europe between the discovery of America and the year 1803 was worth\r\n1257 millions sterling; and the silver alone taken from the mines during\r\nthat period would form a ball 89 feet in diameter. The disturbed state\r\nof the South American republics has interfered with the working of the\r\nmines.\r\n\r\nLead-ore is very often combined with silver, and is then called\r\nArgentiferous Galena. It is one of the principal productions of the\r\nBritish mines, especially in the northern mining district, which\r\noccupies 400 square miles at the junction of Northumberland, Cumberland,\r\nWestmoreland, Durham, and Yorkshire. It comprises Alstan Moor, the\r\nmountain-ridge of Crossfell, and the dales of Derwent, East and West\r\nAllen, the Wear, and Tees. There are other extensive mining tracts\r\nseparated from this by cultivated ground. The principal products of this\r\nrich district are lead and copper. The lead-mines lie chiefly in the\r\nupper dales of the Tyne, Wear, and Tees, and all of it contains more or\r\nless silver, though not always enough to indemnify the expense of\r\nrefining or separating the silver. The deleterious vapours resulting\r\nfrom this process are conveyed in a tube along the surface of the ground\r\nfor 14 miles; and instead of being, as formerly, a dead loss to the\r\nproprietor, they are condensed in their passage, and in one instance\r\nyield metal to the annual value of 10,000_l._[103] The Hudgillburn\r\nlead-mine in that district has yielded treasures almost unexampled in\r\nthe annals of mining. The veins, from ten to twelve, and in some places\r\neven twenty feet wide, were filled with ore which is entirely obtained\r\nwith the pickaxe, without blasting. In 1821 the galena of this mine\r\nyielded 32,000 ounces of silver.\r\n\r\nLead-mines are in operation in France, but not to any great amount:\r\nthose of the south of Spain furnish large quantities of this metal; also\r\nin Saxony, Bohemia, and Carinthia, where they are very rich. Lead is not\r\nvery frequently found in Siberia, though it does occur in the Nerchinsk\r\nmining district, in the basin of the river Amur. It is also a production\r\nof China, of the peninsula beyond the Ganges, and of America. It is also\r\nfound in Lower Peru, Mexico, and in California, where the richest\r\nargentiferous lead is worked.\r\n\r\n[The northwest country, or Upper Mississippi Valley, is among the most\r\nremarkable in the world for the variety and abundance of its mineral\r\ndeposits, and especially for those which are of most extensive use in\r\nthe arts. The sulphuret of lead occupies about one degree of latitude,\r\nextending north from a point on the Mississippi, about eight miles below\r\nGalena, and lying on both sides, varying in width, till it covers as\r\ngreat an extent from east to west. On the east side of the river the\r\nlead-ore is found principally in a clay matrix, at a depth of sometimes\r\nonly five or six feet from the surface; on the west side of the river it\r\nruns at the depth of one hundred feet or more, overlaid with magnesian\r\nlimestone. To the south-west of the lead deposit is a very abundant bed\r\nof iron, about forty miles long by twenty-five broad. The copper region\r\nextends north from the lead deposits to Lake Superior; it embraces about\r\nthree hundred square miles. To the south of the lead region is a vast\r\nbed of bituminous coal of good quality, at no great distance below the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIn the mineral district there are about four thousand persons employed\r\nin digging lead-ore. The value of the lead annually produced is\r\nestimated at $1,500,000. A considerable quantity, in form of pig-lead,\r\nis exported to China.]\r\n\r\nQuicksilver—a metal so important in separating silver from its ores, and\r\nin other arts as well as in medicine—occurs either liquid in the native\r\nstate, or combined with sulphur in that of cinnabar. It is found in the\r\nmines of Idria and some other places in the Austrian empire, in the\r\nPalatinate on the left bank of the Rhine, and in Spain. The richest\r\nquicksilver mines of Europe, at the present day, are those of Almaden,\r\nwhere the quicksilver is found in the state of sulphuret chiefly. These\r\nmines were worked 700 years before the Christian era, and as many as\r\n1200 tons of the metal are extracted annually. It occurs in China,\r\nJapan, and Ceylon, at San Onofro in Mexico; and in Peru, at\r\nGuancavelica, the mines of which, now almost deserted, produced, up to\r\nthe beginning of the present century, the enormous quantity of 54,000\r\ntons of quicksilver. The discovery of quicksilver mines in California\r\nhas been announced.\r\n\r\nCopper is of such common occurrence that it would be vain to enumerate\r\nthe localities where it is found. It is produced in Africa and America,\r\nin Persia, India, China, and Japan. The Siberian mines are very\r\nproductive both in ore and native copper. Malachite is the most\r\nbeautiful of the ores, and the choicest specimens come from Siberia.\r\nAlmost every country in Europe yields copper. The mines in Sweden,\r\nNorway, and Germany are very productive; and it forms a principal part\r\nof our own mineral wealth. It is raised in all the principal mining\r\ndistricts in England and Wales. In Cornwall it is very plentiful, and is\r\noften associated with tin. The period at which the Cornish mines were\r\nfirst worked goes far beyond history, or even tradition: certain,\r\nhowever, it is that the Phœnicians came to Britain for tin. Probably\r\ncopper was also worked very early in small quantities, for its\r\nexportation was forbidden in the time of Henry VIII. It was only in the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century that the Cornish copper-mines were\r\nworked with success, in consequence of the invention of an improved\r\nmachine for draining them.[104]\r\n\r\n[On the lands south of Lake Superior is a body of copper ore, supposed\r\nto be the richest in the world. It is almost pure in some specimens: so\r\nthat, as taken from the earth, it was wrought into church utensils by\r\nsome of the French who first visited the place; and a portion of the\r\nlarge rock deposited on the grounds of the War Department, at\r\nWashington, has been polished so as to present the appearance of\r\nsheet-copper.\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the “American Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience,” held at Cambridge, Mass., August 1849, Mr. J. S. Hodge,\r\nspeaking of the mineral region of Lake Superior, said:—“The mines are\r\nwrought wholly for native copper. The veinstone with scattered\r\nparticles, furnish what is called _stamp work_; which is crushed under\r\nheavy stamps and then washed; the lumps are called _barrel ore_, being\r\npacked in barrels for transportation; and the masses, after being cut up\r\ninto pieces not exceeding two tons in weight, are shipped in bulk. The\r\nsize of some of these masses is so enormous as almost to exceed belief.\r\nThey have been broken up in the Cliff mine of 60 and even 80 tons in\r\nweight. Such pieces are reduced, in the mine, to fragments of seven tons\r\nweight and less, and after being hoisted to the surface are still\r\nfurther reduced.\r\n\r\n“At the Minesota mine, near the Ontonagon river, I had an opportunity of\r\nexamining, in June, the most extraordinary mass yet met with. Two shafts\r\nhad been sunk on the line of the vein 150 feet apart. At the depth of\r\nabout 30 feet they struck massive copper, which lay in a huge sheet with\r\nthe same underlay as that of the vein—about 55° towards the north.\r\nLeaving this sheet as a hanging wall, a level was run under it\r\nconnecting the two shafts. For this whole distance of 150 feet the mass\r\nappears to be continuous, and how much further it goes on the line of\r\nthe vein either way there is no evidence, nor beside to what depth it\r\npenetrates in the solid vein. I examined it with care, striking it\r\nrepeatedly with my hammer in order to detect, if possible, by the sound,\r\nany break or interruption there might be in the mass—for a thin scale of\r\nstone encrusted it sometimes and concealed the face of the metal.\r\nExaminations had been made by drilling through this scale, where it\r\nattained the thickness of an inch or so; but in no place had any sign of\r\na break been found. It forms the whole hanging wall of the level,\r\nshowing a width of at least eight feet above the floor in which its\r\nlower edge was lost. It had been cut through in only one place, where a\r\npartial break afforded a convenient opportunity. Measuring the thickness\r\nhere as well as the irregular shape of the gap admitted, it was found\r\nsomewhat to exceed five feet. Assuming the thickness to _average_ only\r\none foot, there would be in this mass 1200 cubic feet, or about 250\r\ntons—still it is not safe to assume even one foot, for the masses vary\r\nextremely in thickness.\r\n\r\n“The mode adopted to remove these masses is to cut channels through them\r\nwith cold chisels, after they are shattered by large sand blasts put in\r\nbehind them. Grooves are cut with the chisels across their smallest\r\nplaces, one man holding, and another striking, as in drilling. A chip of\r\ncopper three-quarters of an inch wide, and up to six inches in length,\r\nis taken out, and the process is repeated until the groove passes\r\nthrough the mass. The expense of this work is from eight to twelve\r\ndollars per superficial foot of the face exposed. Fragments of veinstone\r\nenclosed in the copper prevent the use of saws. A powerful machine,\r\noccupying little room, is much needed, which would perform more\r\neconomically this work.\r\n\r\n“The greatest thickness of any mass cut through at the Cliff Mine has\r\nbeen about three feet. Their occurrence through the vein is not regular.\r\nBarren spots alternate with productive portions. The same is the case in\r\nall the mines. The total product of the Cliff Mine for the year 1848 is\r\nestimated at 830 tons, averaging 60 per cent. During the present year\r\nmore than half this amount has been already sent down, and there is\r\nenough more on the surface and in sight in the mine to warrant the\r\nbelief that 1000 tons will be the product of the year’s work, or 600\r\ntons of copper. The whole amount of copper annually imported into the\r\nUnited States is about the value of two million dollars, or about 5400\r\ntons. But little has been supplied from our own mines. Nine such mines,\r\nthen, as the Cliff, would render us independent of foreign supplies.\r\nFrom present appearances, after careful examination of the region, and\r\nconsideration of the progress made in mining since my last visit in\r\n1846, I feel myself warranted in expressing a decided conviction that\r\nthis amount of copper must be supplied in very few years, and this metal\r\nsoon become, as lead already has, one of export instead of import. The\r\nrecent failures of mining speculations, wildly undertaken, and\r\nignorantly and extravagantly conducted, may for a time check the\r\ndevelopment of these mines; but their wonderfully rich character is now\r\nbeginning to be properly appreciated, as well as the reliance which may\r\nbe put in the surface-appearance of the veins. Some curious features in\r\ntheir character and distribution have been detected, which have\r\nheretofore escaped observation for want of sufficient data, and which\r\nwill, I believe, be found of great consequence in the selection of the\r\nbest localities. These, after farther examination, I may at another time\r\nmake public. The history of these mines, so far, has remarkably proved\r\nthe foresight and excellent judgment of the lamented Dr. Houghton,\r\nparticularly so in his predictions of the disastrous effects that must\r\nresult from such speculations as have caused the country to be overrun\r\nby hordes of adventurers.\r\n\r\n“The silver found associated with the copper has not proved of much\r\nimportance, perhaps for the reason that the greater part of it is\r\npurloined by the miners. The Cliff Mine has probably yielded more than\r\nthirty thousand dollars worth, of which not more than a tenth part has\r\nbeen secured by the proprietors. I saw myself, the present season, no\r\nless than six pounds and eight ounces of lumps and bars of silver seized\r\nin the hands of an absconding workman.”]\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall clay-slate rests upon granite, and is traversed by\r\nporphyritic dykes. The veins which contain copper or tin, or both, run\r\neast and west, and penetrate both the granite and the clay-slate. The\r\nnon-metalliferous veins run north and south; and if veins in that\r\ndirection do contain any metal, it never is tin or copper, but lead,\r\nsilver, cobalt, or antimony, which with little exception are believed to\r\nbe always in the clay-slate. No miner in Cornwall has ever seen the end\r\nor bottom of a vein; their width varies from the thickness of a sheet of\r\npaper to 30 feet; the average is from one to three feet. It rarely\r\nhappens that either tin or copper is found nearer the surface than 80 or\r\n100 feet. If tin be first discovered, it sometimes disappears after\r\nsinking the mine 100 feet deeper, when copper is found, and in some\r\ninstances tin is found 1000 feet deep without a trace of copper; but if\r\ncopper is first discovered, it is very rarely succeeded by tin. Tin is\r\nfound in rolled pieces, in horizontal beds of sand and gravel, and is\r\ncalled stream-tin. The most valuable tin-mines on the continent of\r\nEurope are those in Saxony; it also occurs in France, Bohemia, and\r\nSpain. One of the richest deposits of tin known is in the province of\r\nTenasserim, on the east side of the gulf of Martaban, in the Malayan\r\npeninsula. These deposits occur in several parts of that country; the\r\nrichest is a layer eight or ten feet thick of sand and gravel, in which\r\nmasses of oxide of tin are sometimes the size of a pigeon’s egg. The\r\nbest of all comes from the island of Banca, at the extremity of the\r\nMalacca peninsula; a large portion of it is imported into Britain, and\r\nmuch goes to China. It is found in the alluvial tracts through every\r\npart of the island, rarely more than 25 feet below the surface. Great\r\ndeposits occur also in the Siberian mining district of Nertshinsk, near\r\nthe desert of the Great Gobi, and in Bolivia, near Oruro.\r\n\r\nThere are comparatively few coal-mines worked within the tropics; they\r\nare mostly in the temperate zones, especially between the Arctic Circle\r\nand the Tropic of Cancer; and as iron, the most useful of metals, is\r\nchiefly found in the carboniferous strata, it follows the same\r\ndistribution. In fact, the most productive iron-mines yet known are in\r\nthe temperate zones. In the eastern mining district of Siberia, in the\r\nvalley of the river Vilui, the ores are very rich, and very abundant in\r\nmany parts of the Altaï and Ural. In the latter, the mountain of Blagod,\r\nat 1534 feet above the sea, is one mass of magnetic iron-ore.[105] Coal\r\nand iron are worked in so many parts of Northern China, Japan, India,\r\nand Eastern Asia, that it would be tedious to enumerate them.\r\n\r\nIn Europe the richest mines of iron, like those of coal, lie chiefly\r\nnorth of the Alps. Sweden, Norway, Russia, Germany, Styria, Belgium, and\r\nFrance, all contain it plentifully. In Britain many of the coalfields\r\ncontain subordinate beds of a rich argillaceous iron-ore,\r\ninterstratified with coal, worked at the same time and in the same\r\nmanner; besides, there is a substratum of limestone, which serves as a\r\nflux for melting the metal. The mines lie near Birmingham, on the\r\nnortheast frontier of the great coal-basin of South Wales, near\r\nPontypool and Merthyr Tydvil. There are extensive iron-mines in\r\nStaffordshire, Shropshire, North and South Wales, Yorkshire, Derbyshire,\r\nand Scotland. Altogether there are about 220 mines, which yield iron\r\nsufficient for our own enormous consumption, and for exportation. These\r\nproductive mines would have been of no avail had it not been for the\r\nabundance of fuel with which the greater part of them in the north of\r\nEngland, Scotland, and Wales are associated—the great source of our\r\nnational wealth, more precious than mines of gold. Most of the\r\ncoal-mines would have been inaccessible but for the means which their\r\nproduce affords of draining them at a small expense. A bushel of coals,\r\nwhich costs only a few pence, in the furnace of a steam-engine generates\r\na power which in a few minutes will raise 20,000 gallons of water from a\r\ndepth of 360 feet—an effect which could not be accomplished in a shorter\r\ntime than a whole day by the continuous labour of twenty men working\r\nwith the common pump. Yet this circumstance, so far from lessening the\r\ndemand for human labour, has caused a greater number of men to be\r\nemployed in the mines.[106]\r\n\r\nThe coal strata lie in basins, dipping from the sides towards the\r\ncentre, which is often at a vast depth below the surface of the ground.\r\nThe centre of the Liege coal-basin is 21,358 feet, or 3-1/2 geographical\r\nmiles deep, which is easily estimated from the dip, or inclination, of\r\nthe strata at the edges, and the extent of the basin. The coal lies in\r\nstrata of small thickness and great extent. It varies in thickness from\r\n3 to 9 feet, though in some instances several layers come together, and\r\nthen it is 20 and even 30 feet thick; but these layers are interrupted\r\nby frequent dislocations, which raise the coal-seam towards the surface.\r\nThese fissures, which divide the coalfield into insulated masses, are\r\nfilled with clay, so that an accumulation of water takes place, which\r\nmust be pumped up.\r\n\r\nThere are three immense coalfields in England. The first lies north of\r\nthe Trent, and occupies an area of 360 square miles; and although the\r\nquantity of coal annually raised in Northumberland and Durham amounts to\r\na million and a half of tons, there is enough to last 1000 years. London\r\nis chiefly supplied from it. The second or central coalfield, which\r\nincludes Leicester, Worcester, Stafford, and Shropshire, has an area of\r\n1495 square miles, and supplies the manufactories round it, and the\r\nmidland counties south and east of Derbyshire. The third or western\r\ncoalfield includes South Wales, Gloucestershire, and Somersetshire. The\r\ncoalfield of South Wales alone is 100 miles long, and 18 or 20 broad.\r\nThe Workington and Whitehaven coal-mines go a mile under the sea;\r\nseveral shafts in the latter are 100 fathoms deep; and it is one of the\r\nfinest in England for extent and thickness of strata, some of the seams\r\nbeing nine feet thick.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch coal-measures occupy the great central low-land of Scotland,\r\nlying between the southern high lands and the Highland mountains; the\r\nwhole of that rude tract is occupied by them, besides which there are\r\nother coalfields of less extent. Coal has been found in seventeen\r\ncounties in Ireland, but the island contains only four principal coal\r\ndistricts—Leinster, Munster, Connaught, and Ulster. Thus, there is coal\r\nenough in the British islands to last some thousands of years; and were\r\nit exhausted, our friends across the Atlantic have enough to supply the\r\nworld for ages uncountable. Moreover, if science continues to advance at\r\nthe rate it has lately done, a substitute for coal will probably be\r\ndiscovered before our own mines are worked out.[107]\r\n\r\nThe carboniferous strata are enormously developed in the States of North\r\nAmerica. The Appalachian coalfield extends, without interruption, 720\r\nmiles, with a maximum breadth of 280 miles, from the northern border of\r\nPennsylvania to near Huntsville, in Alabama, occupying an area of 63,000\r\nsquare miles. It is intersected by three great navigable rivers—the\r\nMonogahela, the Alleghany, and the Ohio—which expose to view the seams\r\nof coal on their banks. The Pittsburgh seam, 10 feet thick, exposed on\r\nthe banks of the Monogahela, extends, horizontally, 225 miles in length\r\nand 100 in breadth, and covers an area of 14,000 square miles, so that\r\nthis seam of coal may be worked for ages almost on the surface, and in\r\nmany places literally so. Indeed, the facility is so great, that it is\r\nmore profitable to convey the coal by water to New Orleans, 1100 miles\r\ndistant, than to cut down the trees with which the country is covered\r\nfor fuel, and which may be had for the expense of felling. The coal is\r\nbituminous, similar to the greater part of the British coal; forty miles\r\nto the east, however, among the ridges of the Appalachian chain, there\r\nis an extensive outlying member of the great coalfield, which yields\r\nanthracite, a species of coal which has the advantage of burning without\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nIn the western States, the Illinois coalfield, which occupies part of\r\nIllinois, Indiana, and Kentucky, is as large as England, and consists of\r\nhorizontal strata, with numerous seams of rich bituminous coal. There is\r\na vast coalfield also in Michigan. Large areas in New Brunswick and Nova\r\nScotia abound in coal. Iron is worked in many parts of the States, from\r\nConnecticut to South Carolina.[109]\r\n\r\nThe tropical regions of the globe have been so little explored that no\r\nidea can be formed of the quantity of coal or iron they contain; but as\r\niron is so universal, it is probable that coal is not wanting. It is\r\nfound in Formosa. Both abound in Borneo, and in various parts of\r\ntropical Africa and America. There is comparatively so little land in\r\nthe southern temperate zone, that the mineral produce must be more\r\nlimited than in the northern, yet New Holland, Van Diemen’s Land, and\r\nNew Zealand are rich in coal and iron.\r\n\r\nArsenic, used in the arts and manufactures, is generally found combined\r\nwith other metals in many countries as well as our own. Manganese, zinc,\r\nbismuth, and antimony are raised to a considerable amount. As the\r\nqualities of the greater part of the more rare metals are little known,\r\nthey have hitherto been interesting chiefly to the mineralogist.\r\n\r\nThe mines of rock-salt in Cheshire seem to be inexhaustible. Enormous\r\ndeposits of salt extend 600 miles on each side of the Carpathian\r\nmountains, and throughout wide districts in Austria, Gallicia, and\r\nSpain. It would not be easy to enumerate the places in Asia where\r\nrock-salt has been found. Armenia, Syria, and extensive tracts in the\r\nPunjab abound in it, also China and the Ural district; and the Andes\r\ncontain vast deposits of rock-salt, some at great heights.\r\n\r\nVolcanic countries in both continents yield sulphur. Sicily, where it is\r\nfound in the tertiary marine strata, unconnected with the volcanic\r\ndistrict, is the magazine which supplies the greater part of the\r\nmanufactures of Europe. It is often found beautifully crystallized.\r\nAsphalt, nitre, alum, and naphtha are found in various parts of Europe\r\nand Asia, and natron is procured from small lakes in an oasis on the\r\nwest of the Valley of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe diffusion of precious stones is very limited. Diamonds are mostly\r\nfound in a soil of sand and gravel, and in the beds of rivers. Brazil\r\nfurnishes most of the diamonds in commerce; they are the produce of\r\ntracts on each side of the Sierra Espenhaço, and of a district watered\r\nby some of the affluents of the Rio San Francesco. During the century\r\nending in 1822, diamonds were collected in Brazil to the value of three\r\nmillions sterling, one of which weighed 138-1/2 carats. The celebrated\r\nmines of Golconda have produced many splendid diamonds; they are also\r\nfound in Borneo, which produced one weighing 367 carats, valued at\r\n269,378_l._ The eastern parts of the Thian-Tchan, on the great platform\r\nof Asia, and a wide district of the Ural Mountains, yield diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe ruby and sapphire have the same crystalline form, and are nearly\r\nallied to corundum; both are found in Ceylon, in the gravel of streams.\r\nThe rubies at Gharan, on the verge of the river Oxus, are found imbedded\r\nin limestone. The gravel of rivulets in the Birman empire contains the\r\noriental, star, and opalescent rubies. The spinelle also occurs in that\r\ncountry in a district five days’ journey from Ava. The Hungarian rubies\r\nare of inferior value. The blue, green, yellow, and white sapphires are\r\nthe produce of the Birman empire, and the spinelle is not uncommon in\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\nThe finest emeralds come from veins of clay-slate in the valley of Musa,\r\nin New Grenada. Beryls are found in Brazil, and in the old mines in\r\nMount Zabarah, in Upper Egypt. Those of Hungary and of the Heubach\r\nValley, near Saltzburg, are very inferior in colour and quality.\r\n\r\nHungary and Bohemia yield the finest opals; the most esteemed are\r\nopaque, of a pale brown, and shine with the most brilliant iridescence;\r\nsome are white, transparent, or semi-transparent, and radiant in\r\ncolours: the precious opal is found in Hungary and in Mexico. The most\r\nbeautiful garnets come from Bohemia and Hungary; they are found in the\r\nHartz mountains, Ceylon, and many other localities. The turquoise is a\r\nPersian gem, and supposed to be the fossilized enamel of the tooth of a\r\nfossil mastodon; it is also found in Tibet and in the Belat-Tagh in\r\nBadakshan, which is the country of the lapis lazuli, mined by heating\r\nthe rock, and then throwing cold water upon it. This beautiful mineral\r\nis also found in several places of the Hindoo Coosh, in the hills of\r\nIstalif north of Cabool, in Tibet, and in the Baikal mountains in\r\nSiberia.\r\n\r\nThe cat’s-eye is peculiar to Ceylon; the king of Kandy had one two\r\ninches broad. Topaz, beryl, and amethyst are of very common occurrence,\r\nespecially in Brazil, Siberia, and other places. They are little valued,\r\nand scarcely accounted gems. Agates are so beautiful on the table-land\r\nof Tibet, and in some parts of the desert of the Great Gobi, that they\r\nform a considerable article of commerce in China; and some are brought\r\nto Rome, where they are cut into cameos and intaglios. But the greater\r\npart of the agates, cornelians, and chalcedonies used in Europe are\r\nfound in the trap-rocks of Oberstein, in the Palatinate.\r\n\r\nThus, by her unseen ministers, electricity and reciprocal action, the\r\ngreat artificer Nature has adorned the depths of the earth and the heart\r\nof the mountains with her most admirable works, filling the veins with\r\nmetals, and building the atoms of matter, with the most elegant and\r\ndelicate symmetry, into innumerable crystalline forms of inimitable\r\ngrace and beauty. The calm and still exterior of the earth gives no\r\nindication of the activity that prevails in its bosom, where treasures\r\nare preparing to enrich future generations of man. Gold will still be\r\nsought for in the deep mine, and the diamond will be gathered among the\r\ndébris of the mountains, while time endures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nThe Ocean—its Size, Colour, Pressure, and Saltness—Tides—Waves—their\r\n  Height and Force—Currents—their Effect on Voyages—Temperature—The\r\n  Stratum of Constant Temperature—Line of Maximum Temperature—North and\r\n  South Polar Ice—Inland Seas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ocean, which fills a deep cavity in the globe, and covers\r\nthree-fourths of its surface, is so unequally distributed that there is\r\nthree times more land in the northern than in the southern hemisphere.\r\nThe torrid zone is chiefly occupied by sea, and only one twenty-seventh\r\npart of the land on one side of the earth has land opposite to it on the\r\nother. The form assumed by this immense mass of water is that of a\r\nspheroid, flattened at the poles; and as its mean level is nearly the\r\nsame, for anything we know to the contrary, it serves as a base to which\r\nall heights of land are referred.\r\n\r\nThe bed of the ocean, like that of the land, of which it is the\r\ncontinuation, is diversified by plains and mountains, table-lands and\r\nvalleys, sometimes barren, sometimes covered with marine vegetation, and\r\nteeming with life. Now it sinks into depths which the sounding-line has\r\nnever fathomed, now it appears in chains of islands, or rises near to\r\nthe surface in hidden reefs and shoals, perilous to the mariner. Springs\r\nof fresh water rise from the bottom, volcanos eject their lavas and\r\nscoriæ, and earthquakes trouble the deep waters.\r\n\r\nThe ocean is continually receiving the spoils of the land, and from that\r\ncause would constantly be decreasing in depth, and, as the quantity of\r\nwater is always the same, its superficial extent would increase. There\r\nare, however, counteracting causes to check this tendency: the secular\r\nelevation of the land over extensive tracts in many parts of the world\r\nis one of the most important. Volcanos, coral islands, and barrier-reefs\r\nshow that great changes of level are constantly taking place in the bed\r\nof the ocean itself—that symmetrical bands of subsidence and elevation\r\nextend alternately over an area equal to a hemisphere, from which it may\r\nbe concluded that the balance is always maintained between the sea and\r\nland, although the distribution may vary in the lapse of time.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific, or Great Ocean, exceeds in superficies all the dry land on\r\nthe globe. It has an area of 50 millions of square miles; including the\r\nIndian Ocean, its area is nearly 70 millions; and its breadth from Peru\r\nto the coast of Africa is 16,000 miles. Its length is less than the\r\nAtlantic, as it only communicates with the Arctic Ocean by Behring’s\r\nStraits, whereas the Atlantic, as far as we know, stretches from pole to\r\npole.\r\n\r\nThe continent of Australia occupies a comparatively small portion of the\r\nPacific, while innumerable islands stud its surface many degrees on\r\neither side of the equator, of which a great number are volcanic,\r\nshowing that its bed has been, and indeed actually is, the theatre of\r\nviolent igneous eruptions. So great is its depth, that a line five miles\r\nlong has not reached the bottom in many places; yet as the whole mass of\r\nthe ocean counts for little in the total amount of terrestrial\r\ngravitation, its mean depth is but a small fraction of the radius of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nThe bed of the Atlantic is a long deep valley, with few mountains, or at\r\nleast but few that raise their summits as islands above its surface. Its\r\ngreatest breadth, including the Gulf of Mexico, is 5000 miles, and its\r\nsuperficial extent is about 25 millions of square miles. This sea is\r\nexceedingly deep: in 27° 26ʹ S. latitude and 17° 29ʹ W. longitude Sir\r\nJames Ross found the depth to be 14,550 feet; about 450 miles west from\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope it was 16,062 feet, or 332 feet more than the\r\nheight of Mont Blanc; and 900 miles west from St. Helena a line of\r\n27,600 feet did not reach the bottom, a depth which is equal to the\r\nheight of some of the most elevated peaks of the Himalaya; but there is\r\nreason to believe that many parts of the ocean are still deeper. A great\r\npart of the German Ocean is only 93 feet deep, though on the Norwegian\r\nside, where the coast is bold, the depth is 190 fathoms.\r\n\r\nImmense sandbanks often project from the land, which rise from great\r\ndepths to within a few fathoms of the surface. Of these, the Aghullas\r\nBanks, off the Cape of Good Hope, are amongst the most remarkable; those\r\nof Newfoundland are still greater in extent: they consist of a double\r\nsandbank, which is supposed to reach to the north of Scotland. The\r\nDogger Bank, in the North Sea, and many others, are well known.\r\nAccording to Mr. Stevenson, one-fifth of the German Ocean is occupied by\r\nsandbanks, whose average height is 78 feet, an area equal to about\r\none-third of Great Britain. Currents are sometimes deflected from their\r\ncourse by sandbanks whose tops do not come within 50 or even 100 feet of\r\nthe surface. Some on the coast of Norway are surrounded by such deep\r\nwater that they must be submarine table-lands. All are the resort of\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nThe pressure at the great depths is enormous. In the Arctic Ocean, where\r\nthe specific gravity of the water is lessened, on account of the greater\r\nproportion of fresh water produced by the melting of the ice, the\r\npressure at the depth of a mile and a quarter is 2809 pounds on a square\r\ninch of surface; this was confirmed by Captain Scoresby, who says, in\r\nhis “Arctic Voyages,” that the wood of a boat suddenly dragged to a\r\ngreat depth by a whale was found, when drawn up, so saturated with water\r\nforced into its pores, that it sank in water like a stone for a year\r\nafterwards. Even sea-water is reduced in bulk from 20 to 19 solid inches\r\nat the depth of 20 miles. The compression that a whale can endure is\r\nwonderful. Many species of fish are capable of sustaining great\r\npressure, as well as sudden changes of pressure. Divers in the\r\npearl-fisheries exert great muscular strength, but man cannot bear the\r\nincreased pressure at great depths, because his lungs are full of air,\r\nnor can he endure the diminution of it at great altitudes above the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe depth to which the sun’s light penetrates the ocean depends upon the\r\ntransparency of the water, and cannot be less than twice the depth to\r\nwhich a person can see from the surface. In parts of the Arctic Ocean\r\nshells are distinctly seen at the depth of 80 fathoms; and among the\r\nWest India islands, in 80 fathoms of water, the bed of the sea is as\r\nclear as if seen in air; shells, corals, and sea-weeds of every hue\r\ndisplay the tints of the rainbow.\r\n\r\nThe purest spring is not more limpid than the water of the ocean; it\r\nabsorbs all the prismatic colours, except that of ultramarine, which,\r\nbeing reflected in every direction, imparts a hue approaching the azure\r\nof the sky. The colour of the sea varies with every gleam of sunshine or\r\npassing cloud, although its true tint is always the same when seen\r\nsheltered from atmospheric influence. The reflection of a boat on the\r\nshady side is often of the clearest blue, while the surface of the water\r\nexposed to the sun is bright as burnished gold. The waters of the ocean\r\nalso derive their colour from animalcules of the infusorial kind,\r\nvegetable substances, and minute particles of matter. It is white in the\r\nGulf of Guinea, black round the Maldives; off California the Vermilion\r\nSea is so called on account of the red colour of the infusoria it\r\ncontains; the same red colour was observed by Magellan near the mouth of\r\nthe river Plate. The Persian Gulf is called the Green Sea by eastern\r\ngeographers, and there is a trail of green water off the Arabian coast\r\nso distinct that a ship has been seen in green and blue water at the\r\nsame time. Rapid transitions take place in the Arctic Sea, from\r\nultramarine to olive-green, from purity to opacity. These appearances\r\nare not delusive, but constant as to place and colour; the green is\r\nproduced by myriads of minute insects, which devour one another and are\r\na prey to the whale. The colour of clearer shallow water depends upon\r\nthat of its bed; over chalk or white-sand it is apple-green, over yellow\r\nsand dark-green, brown or black over dark ground, and grey over mud.\r\n\r\nThe sea is supposed to have acquired its saline principle when the globe\r\nwas in the act of subsiding from a gaseous state. The density of\r\nsea-water depends upon the quantity of saline matter it contains: the\r\nproportion is generally a little above 3 per cent., though it varies in\r\ndifferent places; the ocean contains more salt in the southern than in\r\nthe northern hemisphere, the Atlantic more than the Pacific. The\r\ngreatest proportion of salt in the Pacific is in the parallels of 22° N.\r\nlat. and 17° S. lat.; near the equator it is less, and in the Polar Seas\r\nit is least, from the melting of the ice. The saltness varies with the\r\nseasons in these regions, and the fresh water, being lightest, is\r\nuppermost. Rain makes the surface of the sea fresher than the interior\r\nparts, and the influx of rivers renders the ocean less salt at their\r\nestuaries; the Atlantic is brackish 300 miles from the mouth of the\r\nAmazons. Deep seas are more saline than those that are shallow, and\r\ninland seas communicating with the ocean are less salt, from the rivers\r\nthat flow into them; to this, however, the Mediterranean is an\r\nexception, occasioned by the great evaporation, and the influx of salt\r\ncurrents from the Atlantic. The water in the Straits of Gibraltar at the\r\ndepth of 670 fathoms is four times as salt as that at the surface.\r\n\r\nFresh water freezes at the temperature of 32° of Fahrenheit; the point\r\nof congelation of salt water is much lower. As the specific gravity of\r\nthe water of the Greenland Sea is about 1·02664, it does not freeze till\r\nits temperature is reduced to 28-1/2° of Fahrenheit, so that the saline\r\nprinciple preserves the sea in a liquid state to a much higher latitude\r\nthan if it had been fresh, while it is better suited for navigation by\r\nits greater buoyancy. The healthfulness of the sea is ascribed to the\r\nmixing of the water by tides and currents which prevents the\r\naccumulation of putrescent matter.\r\n\r\nBesides its saline ingredients, the sea contains bromine and iodine in\r\nvery minute quantities, and, no doubt, portions of other substances too\r\nsmall to be detected by chemical analysis, since it has constantly\r\nreceived the débris of the land and all its organized matter.\r\n\r\nRaised by the moon and modified by the sun, the area of the ocean is\r\nelevated into great tidal waves which keep time with the attractions of\r\nthese luminaries at each return to the upper and lower meridian. The\r\nwater under the moon is drawn from the earth by her attraction, at the\r\nsame time that she draws the earth from the water diametrically opposite\r\nto her, in both cases producing a tide of nearly equal height. The\r\nheight to which the tides rise depends upon the relative positions of\r\nthe sun and moon, upon their declination and distance from the earth,\r\nbut much more upon local circumstances. The spring-tides happen at new\r\nand full moon, consequently, twice in a month, because in both cases the\r\nsun and moon are in the same meridian; for when the moon is new they are\r\nin conjunction, and when she is full they are in opposition, and in each\r\nof these positions their attraction is combined to raise the water to\r\nits greatest height; while, on the contrary, the neap or lowest tides\r\nhappen when the moon is in quadrature, or 90° distant from the sun, for\r\nthen they counteract each other’s attraction to a certain degree.\r\n\r\nThe tides ordinarily happen twice in 24 hours, because the rotation of\r\nthe globe brings the same point of the ocean twice under the meridian of\r\nthe moon; but peculiar local circumstances sometimes affect the tides,\r\nso as to produce only one tide in 24 hours, while, on the other hand,\r\nthere have been known three and even four tides in the same space of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAs the earth revolves, a succession of tides follow one another, and are\r\ndiffused over the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, giving birth to\r\nthe tides which wash the shores of the vast continents and islands which\r\nrise above their surfaces; but in what manner those marginal tides\r\nbranch off from the parent wave, science has not yet determined: we know\r\nonly their course along each shore, but are unable to connect these\r\ncurves with the great ridge of the tidal wave.\r\n\r\nIn the Atlantic the marginal wave travels towards the north, and\r\nimpinges upon the coasts of North America and of Europe. In the Indian\r\nOcean it also pursues a northerly course, and finally washes the shores\r\nof Hindostan, the Bay of Bengal, and the Arabian Gulf: while in the\r\nPacific, on the contrary, the waves diverge from the equator towards the\r\npoles—but in all they partake also of the westerly course of the moon.\r\n\r\nAlthough such are the directions in which the tides unquestionably\r\nproceed along the _shores_ of those seas, yet observations at islands in\r\nthe open sea and towards the centres of the oceans contradict the idea\r\nof corresponding progressive waves throughout the entire area of those\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nUpon the coasts of Britain and New Brunswick the tides are high, from\r\nthe local circumstances of the coast and bottom of the sea; while in the\r\ncentre of the ocean, where they are due to the action of the sun and\r\nmoon only, they are remarkably small. The spring-tides rise more than 40\r\nfeet at Bristol, and in the Bay of Fundy, in Nova Scotia, they rise\r\nupwards of 50 feet; the general height in the North Atlantic is 10 or 12\r\nfeet, but in the open and deep sea they are less; and at St. Helena they\r\nare not more than 3 feet, whilst among the islands in the Pacific they\r\nare scarcely perceptible.\r\n\r\nThe mean height of the tides will be increased by a very small quantity\r\nfor ages to come, in consequence of the decrease in the mean distance of\r\nthe moon from the earth; the contrary effect will take place after that\r\nperiod has elapsed, and the moon’s mean distance begins to increase\r\nagain, which it will continue to do for many ages. Thus, the mean\r\ndistance of the moon, and the consequent minute increase in the height\r\nof the tides, will oscillate between fixed limits for ever.[110]\r\n\r\nThe tidal wave extends to the bottom of the ocean, and moves uniformly\r\nand with great speed in very deep water, variably and slow in shallow\r\nwater; the time of propagation depends on the depth of the water as well\r\nas on the nature and form of the shores. Its velocity varies inversely\r\nas the square of the depth—a law which theoretically affords the means\r\nof ascertaining the proportionate depth of the sea in different parts;\r\nit is one of the great constants of nature, and is to fluids what the\r\npendulum is to solids—a connecting link between time and force.\r\n\r\nThe great oceanic wave that twice a-day brings the tides to our shores,\r\nhas occupied a day and a half in travelling from the place where it was\r\ngenerated. The wave first impinges on the west coast of Ireland and\r\nEngland, and then passes round the north of Scotland, up the North Sea,\r\nand enters the Thames, having made the tour of Great Britain in about 18\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nAt the equator the tide-wave follows the moon at the rate of 1000 miles\r\nan hour; it moves very slowly in the northern seas on account of the\r\nshallowness of the water; but the tides are so retarded by the form of\r\nthe coasts and irregularities of the bottom of the sea, that a tide is\r\nsometimes impeded by an obstacle till a second tide reaches the same\r\npoint by a different course, and the water rises to double the height it\r\nwould otherwise have attained. A complete extinction of the tide takes\r\nplace when a high-water interferes in the same manner with a low-water,\r\nas in the centre of the German Ocean—a circumstance predicted by theory,\r\nand confirmed by Captain Hewett, who was not aware that such an\r\ninterference existed. When two unequal tides of contrary phases meet,\r\nthe greater overpowers the lesser, and the resulting height is equal to\r\ntheir difference; such varieties occur chiefly in channels among islands\r\nand at the estuaries of rivers. When the tide flows suddenly up a river\r\nencumbered with shoals, it checks the descent of the stream; the water\r\nspreads over the sands, and a high crested wave, called a bore, is\r\ndriven with force up the channel. This occurs in the Ganges; in the\r\nAmazon, at the equinoxes, where, during three successive days, five of\r\nthese destructive waves, from 12 to 15 feet high, follow one another up\r\nthat river daily; and in a lesser degree in some of our own rivers.\r\n\r\nThere may be some small flow of _stream_ with the oceanic tide; but that\r\ndoes not necessarily follow, since the tide in the open ocean is merely\r\nan alternate rise and fall of the surface: so that the wave, not the\r\nstream, follows the moon. A bird resting on the sea is not carried\r\nforward as the waves rise and fall; indeed, if so heavy a body as water\r\nwere to move at the rate of 1000 miles in an hour, it would cause\r\nuniversal destruction, since in the most violent hurricanes the velocity\r\nof the wind hardly exceeds 100 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nDuring the passage of the great tidal wave in deep water, the particles\r\nof the fluid glide for the moment over each other into a new\r\narrangement, and then retire to their places; but this motion is\r\nextremely limited and momentary. Over shallows, however, and near the\r\nland, both the water and the waves advance during the flow of the tide,\r\nand roll on the beach.[111]\r\n\r\nThe friction of the wind combines with the tides in agitating the\r\nsurface of the ocean, and, according to the theory of undulations, each\r\nproduces its effect independently of the other; wind, however, not only\r\nraises waves, but causes a transfer of superficial water also.\r\nAttraction between the particles of air and water, as well as the\r\npressure of the atmosphere, brings its lower stratum into adhesive\r\ncontact with the surface of the sea. If the motion of the wind be\r\nparallel to the surface, there will still be friction, but the water\r\nwill be smooth as a mirror; but if it be inclined, in however small a\r\ndegree, a ripple will appear. The friction raises a minute wave, whose\r\nelevation protects the water beyond it from the wind, which consequently\r\nimpinges on the surface at a small distance beyond; thus, each impulse,\r\ncombining with the other, produces an undulation which continually\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\nThose beautiful silvery streaks on the surface of a tranquil sea called\r\ncat’s-paws by sailors, are owing to a partial deviation of the wind from\r\na horizontal direction. The resistance of the water increases with the\r\nstrength and inclination of the wind. The agitation at first extends\r\nlittle below the surface, but in long-continued gales even the deep\r\nwater is troubled: the billows rise higher and higher, and, as the\r\nsurface of the sea is driven before the wind, their “monstrous heads,”\r\nimpelled beyond the perpendicular, fall in wreaths of foam. Sometimes\r\nseveral waves overtake one another, and form a sublime and awful sea.\r\nThe highest waves known are those which occur during a north-west gale\r\noff the Cape of Good Hope, aptly called by the ancient Portuguese\r\nnavigators the Cape of Storms: Cape Horn also seems to be the abode of\r\nthe tempest. The sublimity of the scene, united to the threatened\r\ndanger, naturally leads to an over-estimate of the magnitude of the\r\nwaves, which appear to rise mountain-high, as they are proverbially said\r\nto do: there is, however, reason to doubt if the highest waves off the\r\nCape of Good Hope exceed 40 feet from the hollow trough to the summit.\r\nThe waves are short and abrupt in small shallow seas, and on that\r\naccount are more dangerous than the long rolling billows of the wide\r\nocean.\r\n\r\n“The sea-shore after a storm presents a scene of infinite grandeur. It\r\nexhibits the expenditure of gigantic force, which impresses the mind\r\nwith the presence of elemental power as sublime as the water-fall or the\r\nthunder. Long before the waves reach the shore they may be said to feel\r\nthe bottom as the water becomes shallower, for they increase in height,\r\nbut diminish in length. Finally, the waves become higher, more pointed,\r\nassumes a form of unstable equilibrium, totters, becomes crested with\r\nfoam, breaks with great violence, and continuing to break, is gradually\r\nlessened in bulk till it ends in a fringed margin.”[112]\r\n\r\nThe waves raised by the wind are altogether independent of the tidal\r\nwaves; each maintains its undisturbed course; and as the inequalities of\r\nthe coasts reflect them in all directions, they modify those they\r\nencounter and offer new resistance to the wind, so that there may be\r\nthree or four systems or series of co-existing waves, all going in\r\ndifferent directions, while the individual waves of each maintain their\r\nparallelism.\r\n\r\nThe undulation called a ground-swell, occasioned by the continuance of a\r\nheavy gale, is totally different from the tossing of the billows, which\r\nis confined to the area vexed by the wind; whereas the ground-swell is\r\nrapidly transmitted through the ocean to regions far beyond the direct\r\ninfluence of the gale that raised it, and it continues to heave the\r\nsmooth and glassy surface of the deep long after the wind and the\r\nbillows are at rest. In the South Pacific, billows which must have\r\ntravelled 1000 miles against the trade-wind from the seat of the storm,\r\nexpend their fury on the lee side of the many coral islands which bedeck\r\nthat sunny sea.[113] A swell sometimes comes from a quarter in direct\r\nopposition to the wind, and occasionally from various points of the\r\ncompass at the same time, producing a vast commotion even in a dead\r\ncalm, without ruffling the surface. They are the heralds that point out\r\nto the mariner the distant region where the tempest has howled, and not\r\nunfrequently they are the harbingers of its approach. At the margin of\r\nthe polar ice, in addition to other dangers, there is generally a swell\r\nwhich would be very formidable to the mariner in thick weather, did not\r\nthe loud grinding noise of the ice warn him of his approach.\r\n\r\nHeavy swells are propagated through the ocean till they gradually\r\nsubside from the friction of the water, or till the undulation is\r\nchecked by the resistance of land, when they roll in surf to the shore,\r\nor dash in spray and foam over the rocks. The rollers at the Cape de\r\nVerde Islands are seen at a great distance approaching like mountains.\r\nWhen a gale is added to a ground-swell the commotion is great and the\r\nforce of the surge tremendous, tossing huge masses of rock and shaking\r\nthe cliffs to their foundations. During heavy gales on the coast of\r\nMadras the surf breaks in nine fathoms water at the distance of four and\r\neven four and a half miles from the shore. The violence of the tempest\r\nis sometimes so intense as to quell the billows and scatter its surface\r\nin a heavy shower called by sailors spoon-drift. On such occasions\r\nsaline particles have impregnated the air to the distance of 50 miles\r\ninland.\r\n\r\nThe force of the waves in gales of wind is tremendous; from experiments\r\nmade by Mr. Stevenson, civil engineer, on the west coast of Scotland,\r\nexposed to the whole fury of the Atlantic, it appears that the average\r\npressure of the waves during the summer months was equal to 611 pounds\r\nweight on a square foot of surface, while in winter it was 2086 pounds,\r\nor three times as great. During the storm that took place on the 9th of\r\nMarch, 1845, it amounted to 6083 pounds. Now, as the pressure of a wave\r\n20 feet high not in motion is only about half a ton on a square foot, it\r\nshows how much of their force waves owe to their velocity. The rolling\r\nbreakers on the cliffs on the west coast of Ireland are magnificent:\r\nLord Adair measured some that were 50 and even 150 feet high.\r\n\r\nIn the Isle of Man, a block winch weighed about 10 stone was lifted from\r\nits place and carried inland during a north-westerly gale; and in the\r\nHebrides a block of 42 tons weight was moved several feet by the force\r\nof the waves. The Bell Rock light-house in the German Ocean, though 112\r\nfeet high, is literally buried in foam and spray to the very top during\r\nground-swells when there is no wind. On the 20th of November, 1827, the\r\nspray rose 117 feet, so that the pressure was computed by Mr. Stevenson\r\nto be nearly three tons on a square foot.\r\n\r\nThe effect of a gale descends to a comparatively small distance below\r\nthe surface; the sea is probably tranquil at the depth of 200 or 300\r\nfeet; were it not so, the water would be turbid and shellfish would be\r\ndestroyed. Anything that diminishes the friction of the wind smoothes\r\nthe surface of the sea—for example, oil or a small stream of packed ice,\r\nwhich suppresses even a swell. When the air is moist, its attraction for\r\nwater is diminished, and consequently so is the friction; hence the sea\r\nis not so rough in rainy as in dry weather.\r\n\r\nCurrents of various extent, magnitude, and velocity disturb the\r\ntranquillity of the ocean; some of them depend upon circumstances\r\npermanent as the globe itself, others on ever-varying causes. Constant\r\ncurrents are produced by the combined action of the rotation of the\r\nearth, the heat of the sun, and the trade-winds; periodical currents are\r\noccasioned by tides, monsoons, and other long-continued winds; temporary\r\ncurrents arise from the tides, melting ice, and from every gale of some\r\nduration. A perpetual circulation is kept up in the waters of the main\r\nby these vast marine streams; they are sometimes superficial and\r\nsometimes submarine, according as their density is greater or less than\r\nthat of the surrounding sea.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of water between the poles and the equator affects the\r\ngreat currents of the ocean. Although these depend upon the same causes\r\nas the trade-winds, they differ essentially in this respect—that whereas\r\nthe atmosphere is heated from below by its contact with the earth, and\r\ntransmits the heat to the strata above, the sea is heated at its surface\r\nby the direct rays of the sun, which diminish the specific gravity of\r\nthe upper strata, especially between the tropics, and also occasion\r\nstrong and rapid evaporation, both of which causes disturb the\r\nequilibrium of the ocean. The rotation of the earth also gives the water\r\na tendency to take an oblique direction in its flow towards the\r\nequatorial regions, as, in order to restore the equilibrium, deranged by\r\nso many circumstances, great streams perpetually descend from either\r\npole. When these currents leave the poles they flow towards the equator;\r\nbut, before proceeding far, their motion is deflected by the diurnal\r\nrotation of the earth. At the poles they have no rotatory motion; and\r\nalthough they gain it more and more in their progress to the equator,\r\nwhich revolves at the rate of 1000 miles an hour, they arrive at the\r\ntropics before they have acquired the same velocity of rotation with the\r\nintertropical ocean. On that account they are left behind, and\r\nconsequently seem to flow in a direction contrary to the diurnal\r\nrotation of the earth. For that reason the whole surface of the ocean,\r\nfor 30 degrees on each side of the equator, has an apparent tendency\r\nfrom east to west, which produces all the effects of a great current or\r\nstream flowing in that direction. The trade-winds, which blow constantly\r\nin one direction, combine to give this current a mean velocity of 10 or\r\n11 miles in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that the primary currents, as well as those derived\r\nfrom them, are subject to periodical variations of intensity occasioned\r\nby the melting of the ice at each pole alternately.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the uninterrupted expanse of ocean in the southern\r\nhemisphere, the prevalence of westerly winds, and the tendency of the\r\npolar water towards the equator, a great oceanic current is originated\r\nin the Antarctic Sea. Driven by the prevailing winds, the waters take an\r\neasterly direction inclining to the northward, and one part sets upon\r\nthe American coast, where it is divided. A small part doubles Cape Horn,\r\nwhile the main cold stream flows down the American shore; then turning\r\nsuddenly to the west, it loses itself in the great equatorial current of\r\nthe Pacific, which crosses that ocean between the parallels of 26° S.\r\nand 24° N. in a vast stream nearly 3500 miles broad. In the north this\r\nstream is interrupted by the coast of China, the Eastern Peninsula, and\r\nthe islands of the Indian Archipelago; but a part forces its way between\r\nthe islands, and joins the great equatorial current of the Indian Ocean,\r\nwhich, impelled by the S.E. trade-wind, maintains a westerly course\r\nbetween the 10th and 20th parallels of south latitude; as it approaches\r\nthe Island of Madagascar the stream is divided; one part runs to the\r\nnorth-west, bends round the northern end of Madagascar, flows through\r\nthe Mosambique Channel, and, being joined by the other branch, it\r\ndoubles the Cape of Good Hope outside of the Agullhas Bank, and, under\r\nthe name of the South Atlantic Current, it runs along the west coast of\r\nAfrica to the parallel of St. Helena. There it is deflected by the coast\r\nof Guinea, and forms the Great Atlantic Equatorial Current, which flows\r\nwestward and divides upon Cape St. Roque in Brazil. One branch of the\r\nstream setting southward along the continent of South America, becomes\r\ninsensible before it reaches the Straits of Magellan; but an offset from\r\nit stretches directly across the Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nhaving made the circuit of the South Atlantic Ocean, and keeping 150\r\nmiles outside of the Cape or Agullhas current, which runs in the\r\nopposite direction, it pursues its course into the Indian Ocean, where\r\ntraces of it are met with 2000 miles from the Cape.\r\n\r\nThe principal branch of the great equatorial current takes a northerly\r\ncourse from off Cape St. Roque, and rushes along the coast of Brazil\r\nwith such force and depth that it suffers only a temporary deflection by\r\nthe powerful streams of the river Amazon and of the Orinoco. Though much\r\nweakened in passing among the West Indian islands, it acquires new\r\nstrength in the Caribbean Sea. From thence, after sweeping round the\r\nGulf of Mexico with the high temperature of 88° 52ʹ of Fahrenheit, it\r\nflows through the Straits of Florida, and along the North American coast\r\nto Newfoundland under the name of the Gulf-stream: it is there deflected\r\neastward by the form of the land and the prevalent wind, and after\r\npassing Newfoundland by a current from Baffin’s Bay. From the Azores it\r\nbends southward, and aided by the north-east trade rejoins the\r\nequatorial current, having made a circuit of 3800 miles with various\r\nvelocity, leaving a vast loop or space of water nearly stagnant in its\r\ncentre, which is thickly covered with sea-weed. The bodies of men,\r\nanimals, and plants of unknown appearance, brought to the Azores by this\r\nstream, suggested to Columbus the idea of land beyond the Western Ocean,\r\nand thus led to the discovery of America. The Gulf-stream is more salt,\r\nwarmer, and of a deeper blue than the rest of the ocean, till it reaches\r\nNewfoundland, where it becomes turbid from the shallowness of that part\r\nof the sea. Its greatest velocity is 78 miles a-day soon after leaving\r\nthe Florida Strait; and its breadth increases with its distance from the\r\nstrait until the warm water spreads over a large surface of the ocean.\r\nAn important branch leaves the current near Newfoundland, setting\r\ntowards Britain and Norway; which is again subdivided into many\r\nbranches, whose origin is recognized by their greater warmth, even at\r\nthe edge of perpetual ice in the Polar Ocean; and in consequence of some\r\nof these branches the Spitzbergen Sea is 6° or 7° warmer at the depth of\r\n200 fathoms than at its surface. Though the warmth of the Gulf-stream\r\ndiminishes as it goes north, Lieutenant Murray says “that the quantity\r\nof heat which it spreads over the Atlantic in a winter’s day would be\r\nsufficient to raise the whole atmosphere that covers France and Great\r\nBritain from the freezing point to summer heat;” and it really is the\r\ncause of the mildness and of the damp of Ireland and the south of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThese oceanic streams exceed all the rivers in the world in breadth and\r\ndepth as well as length. The equatorial current in the Atlantic is 160\r\nmiles broad off the coast of Africa, and towards its mid-course across\r\nthe Atlantic its width becomes nearly equal to the length of Great\r\nBritain: but as it then sends off a branch to the N.W., it is diminished\r\nto 200 miles before reaching the coast of Brazil. The depth of this\r\ngreat stream is unknown; but the Brazilian branch must be very profound,\r\nsince it is not deflected by the river La Plata, which crosses it with\r\nso strong a current that its fresh muddy waters are perceptible 500\r\nmiles from its mouth. When currents pass over banks and shoals, the\r\ncolder water rises to the surface and gives warning of the danger.\r\n\r\nIn summer, the great north polar current coming along the coasts of\r\nGreenland and Labrador, together with the current from Davis’s Straits,\r\nbrings icebergs to the margin of the Gulf-Stream. The difference between\r\nthe temperatures of these two oceanic streams brought into contact is\r\nthe cause of the dense fogs that brood over the banks of Newfoundland.\r\nThe north polar current runs inside of the Gulf-Stream, along the coast\r\nof North America to Florida, and beyond it—since it sends an\r\nunder-current into the Caribbean Sea. Counter-currents on the surface\r\nare of such frequent occurrence that there is scarcely a strait joining\r\ntwo seas that does not furnish an example—a current running in along one\r\nshore, and a counter-current running out along the other. One of the\r\nmost remarkable occurs in the Atlantic: it begins off the coast of\r\nFrance, and, after sending a mass of water into the Mediterranean, it\r\nholds a southerly direction at some distance from the continent of\r\nAfrica; till, after passing Cape Mesurada, it flows rapidly for 1000\r\nmiles due east to the Bight of Biafra in immediate contact with the\r\nequatorial current, running with great velocity in the opposite\r\ndirection, and seems to merge in it at last.\r\n\r\nPeriodical currents are frequent in the eastern seas: one flows into the\r\nRed Sea from October to May, and out of it from May to October. In the\r\nPersian Gulf this order is reversed; in the Indian Ocean and China Sea\r\nthe waters are driven alternately backwards and forwards by the\r\nmonsoons. It is the southwesterly monsoon that causes inundations in the\r\nGanges, and a tremendous surf on the coast of Coromandel. The tides also\r\nproduce periodical currents on the coasts and in straits, the water\r\nrunning in one direction during the flood, and the contrary way in the\r\nebb. The Roost of Sumburgh, at the southern promontory of Shetland, runs\r\nat the rate of 15 miles an hour; indeed, the strongest tidal currents\r\nknown are among the Orkney and Shetland islands; their great velocity\r\narises from local circumstances. Currents in the wide ocean move at the\r\nrate of from one to three miles an hour, but the velocity is less at the\r\nmargin and bottom of the stream from friction.\r\n\r\nWhirlpools are produced by opposing winds and tides; the whirlpool of\r\nMaelstrom, on the coast of Norway, is occasioned by the meeting of tidal\r\ncurrents round the islands of Lofoden and Mosköe; it is a mile and a\r\nhalf in diameter, and so violent that its roar is heard at the distance\r\nof several leagues.\r\n\r\nAlthough with winds, tides, and currents, it might seem that the ocean\r\nis ever in motion, yet in the equatorial regions, far from land, dead\r\ncalms prevail; the sea is of the most perfect stillness day after day;\r\npartaking of the universal quiet, and heaving its low flat waves in\r\nnoiseless and regular periods as if nature were asleep.\r\n\r\nThe safety and length of a voyage depends upon the skill with which a\r\nseaman avails himself of the set of the different currents, and the\r\ndirection of the permanent and periodical winds; it is frequently\r\nshortened by following a very circuitous track to take advantage of them\r\nif favourable, or to avoid them if unfavourable. From Acapulco, in\r\nMexico, across the Pacific to Manilla or Canton, the trade-wind and the\r\nequatorial current are so favourable that the voyage is accomplished in\r\n50 or 60 days; whereas, in returning, 90 or 100 are required. Within the\r\nAntillas navigation is so difficult from winds and currents, that a\r\nvessel, going from Jamaica to the lesser Antillas, cannot sail directly\r\nacross the Caribbean Sea, but must go round about through the windward\r\npassage between Cuba and Haiti to the ocean; nearly as many weeks are\r\nrequisite to accomplish this voyage as it takes days to return. On\r\naccount of the prevalence of westerly winds in the North Atlantic, the\r\nvoyage from Europe to the United States is longer than that from the\r\nlatter to Europe; but the Gulf-stream is avoided in the outward voyage\r\n[_i. e._ from Europe], because it would lengthen the time by a\r\nfortnight. Ships going to the West Indies, Central or South America,\r\nfrom Europe, generally make the Canary Islands in order to fall in with\r\nthe N.E. trade-winds.\r\n\r\nThe passage to the Cape of Good Hope from the British Channel may be\r\nundertaken at any season, and is accomplished in 50 or 60 days; but it\r\nis necessary to regulate the voyage from the Cape to India and China\r\naccording to the seasons of the monsoons. There are various courses\r\nadopted for that purpose, but all of them pass through the very focus of\r\nthe hurricane district, which includes the islands of Rodriguez, the\r\nMauritius, and Bourbon, and extends from Madagascar to the island of\r\nTimor.\r\n\r\nThe extensive deposits of coal discovered in the Bay of Talcahuano, in\r\nChile, in Australia, New Zealand, in the British settlement at Labuan,\r\nand in Borneo, will be the means of increasing the steam navigation of\r\nthe Pacific, and shortening the voyages upon that ocean.\r\n\r\nSea-water is a bad conductor of heat, therefore the temperature of the\r\nocean is less liable to sudden changes than the atmosphere; the\r\ninfluence of the seasons is imperceptible at the depth of 300 feet; and\r\nas light probably does not penetrate lower than 700 feet, the heat of\r\nthe sun cannot affect the bottom of a deep sea. It has been established\r\nbeyond a doubt that in all parts of the ocean the water has a constant\r\ntemperature of about 39°·5 of Fahrenheit, at a certain depth, depending\r\non the latitude. At the equator the stratum of water at that temperature\r\nis at the depth of 7200 feet; from thence it gradually rises till it\r\ncomes to the surface in S. lat. 56° 26ʹ, where the water has the\r\ntemperature of 39°·5 at all depths; it then gradually descends till S.\r\nlat. 70°, where it is 4500 feet below the surface. In going north from\r\nthe equator the same law is observed. Hence, with regard to temperature,\r\nthere are three regions in the ocean: one equatorial and two polar. In\r\nthe equatorial region the temperature of the water at the surface of the\r\nocean is 80° of Fahrenheit, therefore higher than that of the stratum of\r\n39°·5; while in the polar regions it is lower. Thus, the surface of the\r\nstratum of constant temperature is a curve which begins at the depth of\r\n4500 feet in the southern basin, from whence it gradually rises to the\r\nsurface in S. lat. 56° 26ʹ; it then sweeps down to 7200 feet at the\r\nequator, and rises up again to the surface in the corresponding northern\r\nlatitude, from whence it descends again to a depth of 4500 feet in the\r\nnorthern basin.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the surface of the ocean decreases from the equator\r\nto the poles. For 10 degrees on each side of the line the maximum is 80°\r\nof Fahrenheit, and remarkably stable; from thence to each tropic the\r\ndecrease does not exceed 3°·7. The tropical temperature would be greater\r\nwere it not for the currents, because the surface reflects much fewer of\r\nthe sun’s rays which fall on it directly, than in higher latitudes where\r\nthey fall obliquely. In the torrid zone the surface of the sea is about\r\n3°·5 of Fahrenheit warmer than the air above it; because the polar\r\nwinds, and the great evaporation which absorbs the heat, prevent\r\nequilibrium; and as a great mass of water is slow in following the\r\nchanges in the atmosphere, the vicissitude of day and night has little\r\ninfluence, whereas in the temperate zones it is perceptible.\r\n\r\nThe line of maximum temperature, or that which passes through all the\r\npoints of greatest heat in the ocean, is very irregular, and does not\r\ncoincide with the terrestrial equator; six-tenths of its extent lies on\r\nan average 5° to the north of it, and the remainder runs at a mean\r\ndistance of 3° on its southern side. It cuts the terrestrial equator in\r\nthe middle of the Pacific Ocean in 21° E. longitude in passing from the\r\nnorthern to the southern hemisphere, and again between Sumatra and the\r\npeninsula of Malacca in returning from the southern to the northern. Its\r\nmaximum temperature in the Pacific is 88°·5 of Fahrenheit on the\r\nnorthern shores of New Guinea, where it touches the terrestrial equator,\r\nand its highest temperature in the Atlantic, which is exactly the same,\r\nlies in the Gulf of Mexico, which furnishes the warm water of the\r\nGulf-stream.\r\n\r\nThe superficial water of the Pacific is much cooled on the east by the\r\nAntarctic current; it sends a cold stream along the coasts of Chile and\r\nPeru, which has great influence on the climate of both countries; it was\r\nfirst observed by Baron Humboldt, and is known as Humboldt’s current. It\r\nis more than 14° colder than the adjacent ocean, and renders the air 11°\r\ncooler than the surrounding atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the Indian Ocean the highest temperature of the surface-water (87°·4)\r\nis in the Arabian Sea, between the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb and the coast\r\nof Hindostan; it decreases regularly from south to north in the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nThe superficial temperature diminishes from the tropics with the\r\nincrease of the latitude more rapidly in the southern than in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, till towards the poles the sea is never free from\r\nice. In the Arctic Ocean the surface is at the freezing point even in\r\nsummer; and during the eight winter months a continuous body of ice\r\nextends in every direction from the pole, filling the area of a circle\r\nof between 3000 and 4000 miles in diameter. The outline of this circle,\r\nthough subject to partial variations, is found to be nearly similar at\r\nthe same season of each succeeding year, yet there are periodical\r\nchanges in the polar ice which are renewed after a series of years. The\r\nfreezing process itself is a bar to the unlimited increase of the\r\noceanic ice. Fresh water congeals at the temperature of 32° of\r\nFahrenheit, but sea-water must be reduced to 28°·5 before it deposits\r\nits salt and begins to freeze: the salt thus set free, and the heat\r\ngiven out, retard the process of congelation more and more below.\r\n\r\nThe ice from the north pole comes so far south in winter as to render\r\nthe coast of Newfoundland inaccessible: it envelops Greenland, sometimes\r\neven Iceland, and always invests Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla. As the sun\r\ncomes north the ice breaks up into enormous masses of what is called\r\npacked ice. In the year 1806 Captain Scoresby forced his ship through\r\n250 miles of packed ice, in imminent danger, until he reached the\r\nparallel of 81° 50ʹ, his nearest approach to the pole: the Frozen Ocean\r\nis rarely navigable so far.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1827 Sir Edward Parry arrived at the latitude of 82° 45ʹ,\r\nwhich he accomplished by dragging a boat over fields of ice, but he was\r\nobliged to abandon the bold and hazardous attempt to reach the pole,\r\nbecause the current drifted the ice southward more rapidly than he could\r\ntravel over it to the north.\r\n\r\nThe following considerations have induced some persons to believe that\r\nthere is sea instead of land at the north pole. The average latitude of\r\nthe northern shores of the continent is 70°, so that the Arctic Ocean is\r\na circle whose diameter is 2400 geographical miles, and its\r\ncircumference 7200. On the Asiatic side of this sea are Nova Zembla and\r\nthe New Siberian islands, each extending to about 76° N. latitude. On\r\nthe European and American sides are Spitzbergen, extending to 80°, and a\r\npart of Old Greenland, whose northern termination is unknown. Facing\r\nAmerica is a large island—Melville Island—with some others not extending\r\nso far north as those mentioned; consequently all of them may be\r\nconsidered continental islands. As there are no large islands very far\r\nfrom land in the other great oceans, there is reason to presume that the\r\nsame structure may prevail here also, and, consequently, it may be open\r\nsea at the north pole. Possibly also it may be free from ice, for\r\nAdmiral Wrangel found a wide and open sea, free from ice and navigable,\r\nbeginning 16 miles north of the island of Kotelnoi, and extending to the\r\nmeridian of Cape Jackan. In fine summers the ice suddenly clears away\r\nand leaves an open channel of sea along the western coast of Spitzbergen\r\nfrom 60 to 150 miles wide, reaching to 80° or even to 80-1/2° N.\r\nlatitude probably owing to warm currents from low latitudes. It was\r\nthrough this channel that Captain Scoresby made his nearest approach to\r\nthe pole. A direct course from the Thames, across the pole to Behring’s\r\nStraits, is 3570 geographical miles, while by Lancaster Sound it is 4660\r\nmiles. The Russians would be saved a voyage of 18,800 geographical miles\r\ncould they go across the pole and through Behring’s Straits to their\r\nNorth American settlements, instead of going by Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nFloating fields of ice, 20 or 30 miles in diameter, are frequent in the\r\nArctic Ocean: sometimes they extend 100 miles, so closely packed\r\ntogether that no opening is left between them; their thickness, which\r\nvaries from 10 to 40 feet, is not seen, as there is at least two-thirds\r\nof the mass below water. Sometimes these fields, many thousand millions\r\nof tons in weight, acquire a rotatory motion of great velocity, dashing\r\nagainst one another with a tremendous collision. Packed ice always has a\r\ntendency to drift southwards, even in the calmest weather; and in their\r\nprogress the ice-fields are rent in pieces by the swell of the sea. It\r\nis computed that 20,000 square miles of drift ice are annually brought\r\nby the current along the coast of Greenland to Cape Farewell. In stormy\r\nweather the fields and streams of ice are covered with haze and spray\r\nfrom constant tremendous concussions; yet our seamen, undismayed by the\r\nappalling danger, boldly steer their ships amidst this hideous and\r\ndiscordant tumult.\r\n\r\nHuge icebergs and masses detached from the glaciers, which extend from\r\nthe Arctic lands into the sea, especially in Baffin’s Bay, are drifted\r\nsouthwards 2000 miles from their origin to melt in the Atlantic, where\r\nthey cool the water sensibly for 30 or 40 miles around, and the air to a\r\nmuch greater distance. They vary from a few yards to miles in\r\ncircumference, and rise hundreds of feet above the surface. Seven\r\nhundred such masses have been seen at once in the polar basin. When\r\nthere is a swell the loose ice dashing against them raises the spray to\r\ntheir very summits; and as they waste away they occasionally lose\r\nequilibrium and roll over, causing a swell which breaks up the\r\nneighbouring field-ice; the commotion spreads far and wide, and the\r\nuproar resounds like thunder.\r\n\r\nIcebergs have the appearance of chalk-cliffs with a glittering surface\r\nand emerald-green fractures: pools of water of azure-blue lie on their\r\nsurface or fall in cascades into the sea. The field-ice also, and the\r\nmasses that are heaped up on its surface, are extremely beautiful from\r\nthe vividness and contrast of their colouring. A peculiar blackness in\r\nthe atmosphere around a bright haze at the horizon indicates their\r\nposition in a fog, and their place and character are shown at night by\r\nthe reflection of the snow-light on the horizon. An experienced seaman\r\ncan readily distinguish by the blink, as it is termed, whether the ice\r\nis newly-formed, heavy, compact, or open. The blink or snow-light of\r\nfield-ice is the most lucid, and is tinged yellow; of packed ice it is\r\npure white: ice newly formed has a greyish blink, and a deep yellow tint\r\nindicates snow on land.\r\n\r\nIcebergs come to a lower latitude by 10° from the south pole than from\r\nthe north, and appear to be larger; they have been seen near the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, and are often of great size; one observed by Captain\r\nD’Urville was 13 miles long, with perpendicular sides 100 feet high;\r\nthey are less varied than those on the northern seas, a tabular form is\r\nthe most prevalent. The discovery ships under the command of Sir James\r\nRoss met with multitudes with flat surfaces, bounded by perpendicular\r\ncliffs on every side, from 100 to 180 feet high, sometimes several miles\r\nin circumference. On one occasion they fell in with a chain of\r\nstupendous bergs close to one another, extending farther than the eye\r\ncould reach even from the mast-head. Packed ice too is often in immense\r\nquantities: these ships forced their way through a pack 1000 miles\r\nbroad, often under the most appalling circumstances. It generally\r\nconsists of smaller pieces than the packs in the comparatively tranquil\r\nNorth Polar seas, where they are often several miles in diameter, and\r\nwhere fields of ice extend beyond the reach of vision. The Antarctic\r\nOcean, on the contrary, is almost always agitated; there is a perpetual\r\nswell, and terrific storms are common, which break up the ice and render\r\nnavigation perilous. The floe pieces are rarely a quarter of a mile in\r\ncircumference, and generally much smaller.\r\n\r\nA more dreadful situation can hardly be imagined than that of ships\r\nbeset during a tempest in a dense pack of ice in a dark night, thick\r\nfog, and drifting snow, with the spray beating perpetually over the\r\ndecks, and freezing instantaneously. Sir James Ross’s own words can\r\nalone give an idea of the terrors of one of the many gales which the two\r\nships under his command encountered:—“Soon after midnight our ships were\r\ninvolved in an ocean of rolling fragments of ice, hard as floating rocks\r\nof granite, which were dashed against them by the waves with so much\r\nviolence, that their masts quivered as if they would fall at every\r\nsuccessive blow; and the destruction of the ships seemed inevitable from\r\nthe tremendous shocks they received. In the early part of the storm the\r\nrudder of the Erebus was so much damaged as to be no longer of any use;\r\nand about the same time I was informed by signal that the Terror’s was\r\ncompletely destroyed and nearly torn away from the stern-post. Hour\r\npassed away after hour without the least mitigation of the awful\r\ncircumstances in which we were placed. The loud crashing noise of the\r\nstraining and working of the timbers and decks, as they were driven\r\nagainst some of the heavier pieces of ice, which all the exertions of\r\nour people could not prevent, was sufficient to fill the stoutest heart,\r\nthat was not supported by trust in Him who controls all events, with\r\ndismay; and I should commit an act of injustice to my companions if I\r\ndid not express my admiration of their conduct on this trying occasion.\r\nThroughout a period of 28 hours, during any one of which there appeared\r\nto be very little hope that we should live to see another, the coolness,\r\nsteady obedience, and untiring exertions of each individual, were every\r\nway worthy of British seamen.\r\n\r\n“The storm gained its height at 2 P.M., when the barometer stood at\r\n28·40 inches, and after that time began to rise. Although we had been\r\nforced many miles deeper into the pack, we could not perceive that the\r\nswell had at all subsided, our ships still rolling and groaning amidst\r\nthe heavy fragments of crushing bergs, over which the ocean rolled its\r\nmountainous waves, throwing huge masses upon one another, and then again\r\nburying them deep beneath its foaming waters, dashing and grinding them\r\ntogether with fearful violence.” For three successive years were these\r\ndangers encountered during this bold and hazardous enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe ocean is one mass of water, which, entering into the interior of the\r\ncontinents, has formed seas and gulfs of great magnitude, which afford\r\neasy and rapid means of communication, while they temper the climates of\r\nthe widely expanding continents.\r\n\r\nThe inland seas communicating with the Atlantic are larger, and\r\npenetrate more deeply into the continents, than those connected with the\r\ngreat ocean; a circumstance which gives a coast of 48,000 miles to the\r\nformer, while that of the great ocean is only 44,000. Most of these\r\ninternal seas have extensive river domains, so that by inland navigation\r\nthe Atlantic virtually enters into the deepest recesses of the land,\r\nbrings remote regions into contact, and improves the condition of the\r\nless cultivated races of mankind by commercial intercourse with those\r\nthat are more civilized.\r\n\r\nThe Baltic, which occupies 125,000 square miles in the centre of\r\nnorthern Europe, is one of the most important of the inland seas\r\nconnected with the Atlantic, and, although inferior to the others in\r\nsize, the drainage of more than a fifth of Europe flows into it. Only\r\nabout a fourth part of the boundary of its enormous basin of 900,000\r\nsquare miles is mountainous; and so many navigable rivers flow into it\r\nfrom the watershed of the great European plain, that its waters are\r\none-fifth less salt than those of the Atlantic: it receives at least 250\r\nstreams. Its depth nowhere exceeds 167 fathoms,[114] and generally it is\r\nnot more than 40 or 50. From that cause, together with its freshness and\r\nnorthern latitude, the Baltic is frozen five months in the year. From\r\nthe flatness of the greater part of the adjacent country, the climate of\r\nthe Baltic is subject to influences coming from regions far beyond the\r\nlimits of its river-basin. The winds from the Atlantic bring warmth and\r\nmoisture, which, condensed by the cold blasts from the Arctic plains,\r\nfalls in rain in summer, and deep snow in winter, which also makes the\r\nsea more fresh. The tides are imperceptible; but the waters of the\r\nBaltic occasionally rise more than three feet above their usual level\r\nfrom some unknown cause—possibly from oscillations in its bed, or from\r\nchanges of atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nThe Black Sea, which penetrates most deeply into the continent of all\r\nthe seas in question, has, together with the Sea of Azov, an area of\r\n190,000 square miles: it must at a remote period have been united with\r\nthe Caspian Lake, and must have covered all the Steppe of Astracan. It\r\nreceives some of the largest European rivers, and drains about 950,000\r\nsquare miles, consequently its waters are brackish and freeze on its\r\nnorthern shores in winter. It is very deep, no bottom having been\r\nreached with a line of 140 fathoms: on the melting of the snow, such a\r\nbody of water is poured into it by the great European rivers that a\r\nrapid current is produced, which sets along the western shore from the\r\nmouth of the Dnieper to the channel of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nOf all the branches of the Atlantic that enter deeply into the bosom of\r\nthe land, the Mediterranean is the largest and most beautiful, covering\r\nwith its dark blue waters more than 760,000 square miles. Situate in a\r\ncomparatively low latitude, exposed to the heat of the African deserts\r\non the south, and sheltered on the north by the Alps, the evaporation is\r\nexcessive; on that account the water of the Mediterranean is salter than\r\nthat of the ocean, and for the same reason the temperature at its\r\nsurface is 3-1/2° of Fahrenheit higher than that of the Atlantic: it\r\ndoes not decrease so rapidly downwards as in tropical seas, and it\r\nbecomes constant at depths of from 340 to 1000 fathoms, according to the\r\nsituations. Although its own river domain is only 250,000 square miles,\r\nthe constant current that sets in through the Dardanelles brings a great\r\npart of the drainage of the Black Sea, so that it is really fed by the\r\nmelted snow and rivers from the Caucasus, Asia Minor, Abyssinia, the\r\nAtlas, and the Alps. Yet the quantity of water that flows into the\r\nMediterranean from the Atlantic, by the central current in the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar, exceeds that which goes out by the lateral currents.\r\n\r\nNear Alexandria the surface of this sea is 26 feet 6 inches lower than\r\nthe level of the Red Sea at Suez at low water, and about 30 feet lower\r\nat high water.[115]\r\n\r\nOn the shore of Cephalonia there is a cavity in the rocks, into which\r\nthe sea has been flowing for ages.[116]\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean is divided into two basins by a shallow that runs from\r\nCape Bon on the African coast to the Strait of Messina, on each side of\r\nwhich the water is exceedingly deep, and said to be unfathomable in some\r\nparts. M. Bérard has sounded to the depth of more than 1000 fathoms in\r\nseveral places without reaching the bottom. At Nice, within a few yards\r\nof the shore, it is nearly 700 fathoms deep; and Captain Smyth, R. N.,\r\nascertained the depth to be 960 fathoms between Gibraltar and Ceuta.\r\nThis sea is not absolutely without tides; in the Gulf of Venice they\r\nrise three feet, and at the Great Syrte to five feet at new and full\r\nmoon, but in most other places they are scarcely perceptible. The\r\nsurface is traversed by various currents, two of which, opposing one\r\nanother, occasion the celebrated whirlpool of Charybdis, whose terrors\r\nwere much diminished by the earthquake of 1783. Its bed is subject to\r\nviolent volcanic paroxysms, and its surface is studded with islands of\r\nall sizes, from the magnificent kingdom of Sicily to mere barren rocks—\r\nsome actively volcanic, others of volcanic formation, and many of the\r\nsecondary geological period.\r\n\r\nVarious parts of its coasts are in a state of great instability; in some\r\nplaces they have sunk down and risen again more than once within the\r\nhistorical period.\r\n\r\nFar to the north the Atlantic penetrates the American continent by\r\nDavis’s Straits, and spreads out into Baffin’s bay, twice the size of\r\nthe Baltic, very deep, and subject to all the rigours of an arctic\r\nwinter—the very storehouse of icebergs—the abode of the walrus and the\r\nwhale. Hudson’s Bay, though without the Arctic Circle, is but little\r\nless dreary.\r\n\r\nVery different is the character of those vast seas where the Atlantic\r\ncomes “cranking in” between the northern and southern continents of\r\nAmerica. The surface of the sea in Baffin’s Bay is seldom above the\r\nfreezing-point; here, on the contrary, it is always 88°·5 of Fahrenheit,\r\nwhile the Atlantic Ocean in the same latitude is not above 77° or 78°.\r\nOf that huge mass of water, partially separated from the Atlantic by a\r\nlong line of islands and banks, the Caribbean Sea is the largest; it is\r\nas long from east to west as the distance between Great Britain and\r\nNewfoundland, and occupies a million of square miles. Its depth in many\r\nplaces is very great, and its water is limpid. The Gulf of Mexico, fed\r\nby the Mississippi, one of the greatest of rivers, is more than half its\r\nsize, or about 625,000 square miles, so that the whole forms a sea of\r\ngreat magnitude. Its shores, and the shores of the numerous islands, are\r\ndangerous from shoals and coral-reefs, but the interior of these seas is\r\nnot. The trade-winds prevail there; they are subject to severe northern\r\ngales, and some parts are occasionally visited by tremendous hurricanes.\r\n\r\nBy the levelling across the peninsula of Panama by Mr. Lloyd, in 1828,\r\nthe mean height of the Pacific above that of the Atlantic was found to\r\nbe three feet six inches.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific does not penetrate the land in the same manner that the\r\nAtlantic does the continent of Europe. The Red Sea and Persian Gulf are\r\njoined to it by very narrow straits; but almost all the internal seas on\r\nthe eastern coast of Asia, except the Yellow Sea, are great gulfs shut\r\nin by islands, like the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, to which\r\nthe China Sea, the Sea of Japan, and that of Okhotsk are perfectly\r\nanalogous.\r\n\r\nThe set of the great oceanic currents has scooped out and indented the\r\nsouthern and eastern coasts of the Asiatic continent into enormous bays\r\nand gulfs, and has separated large portions of the land, which now\r\nremain as islands—a process which probably has been increased by the\r\nsubmarine fires extending along the eastern coast from the equator\r\nnearly to the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\nThe perpetual agitation of the ocean by winds, tides, and currents, is\r\ncontinually, but slowly, changing the form and position of the land—\r\nsteadily producing those vicissitudes on the surface of the earth to\r\nwhich it has been subject for ages, and to which it will assuredly be\r\nliable in all time to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nSprings—Basins of the Ocean—Origin, Course, and Heads of Rivers—\r\n  Hydraulic Systems of Europe—African Rivers—the Nile, Niger, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE vapour which rises invisibly from the land and water ascends in the\r\natmosphere till it is condensed by the cold into clouds, which restore\r\nit again to the earth in the form of rain, hail, and snow; hence, there\r\nis probably not a drop of water on the globe that has not been borne on\r\nthe wings of the wind. Part of this moisture restored to the earth is\r\nreabsorbed by the air, part supplies the wants of animal and vegetable\r\nlife, a portion is carried off by the streams, and the remaining part\r\npenetrates through porous soils till it arrives at a stratum impervious\r\nto water, where it accumulates in subterranean lakes often of great\r\nextent. The mountains receive the greatest portion of the aërial\r\nmoisture, and, from the many alternations of permeable and impermeable\r\nstrata they contain, a complete system of reservoirs is formed in them,\r\nwhich, continually overflowing, form perennial springs at different\r\nelevations, which unite and run down their sides in incipient rivers. A\r\ngreat portion of the water at these high levels penetrates the earth\r\ntill it comes to an impermeable stratum below the plains, where it\r\ncollects in a sheet, and is forced by hydraulic pressure to rise in\r\nsprings, through cracks in the ground, to the surface. In this manner\r\nthe water which falls on hills and mountains is carried through\r\nhighly-inclined strata to great depths, and even below the bed of the\r\nocean, in many parts of which there are springs of fresh water. In\r\nboring Artesian wells the water often rushes up with such impetuosity by\r\nthe hydrostatic pressure as to form jets 40 or 50 feet high. In this\r\noperation several successive reservoirs have been met with; at St. Ouen,\r\nnear Paris, five sheets of water were found; the water in the first four\r\nnot being good, the operation was continued to a greater depth; it\r\nconsists merely in boring a hole of small diameter, and lining it with a\r\ntube. It rarely happens that water may not be procured in this way; and\r\nas the substratum in many parts of deserts is an argillaceous marl, it\r\nis probable that Artesian wells might be bored with success.\r\n\r\nA spring will be intermittent when it issues from an opening in the side\r\nof a reservoir fed from above, if the supply be not equal to the waste,\r\nfor the water will sink below the opening, and the spring will stop till\r\nthe reservoir is replenished. Few springs give the same quantity of\r\nwater at all times; they also vary much in the quantity of foreign\r\nmatter they contain. Mountain-springs are generally very pure, the\r\ncarbonic acid gas almost always found in them escapes into the\r\natmosphere, and their earthy matter is deposited as they run along, so\r\nthat river-water from such source is soft, while wells and springs in\r\nthe plains are hard, and more or less mineral.\r\n\r\nThe water of springs takes its temperature from that of the strata\r\nthrough which it passes: mountain-springs are cold, but, if the water\r\nhas penetrated deep into the earth, it acquires a temperature depending\r\non that circumstance.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the surface of the earth varies with the seasons to a\r\ncertain depth, where it becomes permanent and equal to the mean annual\r\ntemperature of the air above. It is evident that the depth at which this\r\nstratum of invariable temperature lies must vary with the latitude. At\r\nthe equator the effect of the seasons is imperceptible at the depth of a\r\nfoot below the surface: between the parallels of 40° and 52° the\r\ntemperature of the ground in Europe is constant at the depth of from 55\r\nto 60 feet: and in the high Arctic regions the soil is perpetually\r\nfrozen a foot below the surface. Now, in every part of the world where\r\nexperiments have been made, the temperature of the earth increases with\r\nthe depth below the constant stratum at the rate of 1° of Fahrenheit for\r\nevery 50 or 60 feet of perpendicular depth; hence, should the increase\r\ncontinue to follow the same ratio, even granite must be in fusion at\r\nlittle more than five miles below the surface. In Siberia, the stratum\r\nof frozen earth is some hundred feet thick, but below that the increase\r\nof heat with the depth is three times as rapid as in Europe. The\r\ntemperature of springs must therefore depend on the depth to which the\r\nwater has penetrated before it has been forced to the surface, either by\r\nthe hydraulic pressure of water at higher levels, or by steam. If it\r\nnever goes below the stratum of invariable temperature, the heat of the\r\nspring will vary with the seasons, more or less, according to the depth\r\nbelow the surface: should the water come from the constant stratum\r\nitself, its temperature will be invariable; and if from below it, the\r\nheat will be in proportion to the depth to which it has penetrated.\r\nThus, there may be hot and even boiling springs hundreds of miles\r\ndistant from volcanic action and volcanic strata, of which there are\r\nmany examples, though they are more frequent in volcanic countries and\r\nthose subject to earthquakes. The temperature of hot springs is very\r\nconstant, and that of boiling springs has remained unchanged for ages;\r\nshocks of earthquakes sometimes affect the temperature, and have even\r\nstopped them altogether. Jets of steam of high tension are frequent in\r\nvolcanic countries, as in Iceland.\r\n\r\nBoth hot and cold water dissolves and combines with many of the mineral\r\nsubstances it meets with in the earth, and comes to the surface from\r\ngreat depths as medicinal springs, containing various ingredients. So\r\nnumerous are they that in the Austrian dominions alone there are 1500;\r\nand few countries of any extent are destitute of them. They contain\r\nhydro-sulphuric and carbonic acids, sulphur, iron, magnesia, and other\r\nsubstances. Boiling springs deposit silex, as in Iceland and in the\r\nAzores; and others of lower temperature deposit carbonate of lime in\r\ngreat quantities all over the world. Springs of pure brine are rare;\r\nthose in Cheshire are rich in salt, and have flowed unchanged 1000\r\nyears, a proof of the tranquil state of that part of the globe. Many\r\nsubstances that lie beyond our reach are brought to the surface by\r\nsprings, as naphtha, petroleum, and boracic acid: petroleum is\r\nparticularly abundant in Persia, and numberless springs and lakes of it\r\nsurround some parts of the Caspian Sea. It is found in immense\r\nquantities in various parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RIVERS.\r\n\r\nRivers have had a greater influence on the location and fortunes of the\r\nhuman race than almost any other physical cause, and, since their\r\nvelocity has been overcome by steam navigation, they have become the\r\nhighway of the nations.\r\n\r\nThey frequently rise in lakes, which they unite with the sea; in other\r\ninstances they spring from small elevations in the plains, from\r\nperennial sources in the mountains, alpine lakes, melted snow and\r\nglaciers; but the everlasting storehouses of the mightiest floods are\r\nthe ice-clad mountains of table-lands.\r\n\r\nRivers are constantly increased, in descending the mountains and\r\ntraversing the plains, by tributaries, till at last they flow into the\r\nocean, their ultimate destination and remote origin. “All rivers run\r\ninto the sea, yet the sea is not full,” because it gives in evaporation\r\nan equivalent for what it receives.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic, the Arctic, and the Pacific Oceans are directly or\r\nindirectly the recipients of all the rivers, therefore their basins are\r\nbounded by the principal watersheds of the continents; for the basin of\r\na sea or ocean does not mean only the bed actually occupied by the\r\nwater, but comprehends also all the land drained by the rivers which\r\nfall into it, and is bounded by an imaginary line passing through all\r\ntheir sources. These lines generally run through the elevated parts of a\r\ncountry that divide the streams which flow in one direction from those\r\nthat flow in another. But the watershed does not coincide, in all cases,\r\nwith mountain-crests of great elevation, as the mere convexity of a\r\nplain is often sufficient to throw the streams into different\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nFrom the peculiar structure of the high land and mountain-chains, by far\r\nthe greater number of important rivers on the globe flow into the ocean\r\nin an easterly direction, those which flow to the south and north being\r\nthe next in size, while those that flow in a westerly direction are\r\nsmall and unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe course of all rivers is changed when they pass from one geological\r\nformation to another, or by dislocations of the strata: the sudden\r\ndeviations in their directions are generally owing to these\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nNone of the European rivers flowing directly into the Atlantic exceed\r\nthe fourth or fifth magnitude, except the Rhine; the rest of the\r\nprincipal streams come to it indirectly through the Baltic, the Black\r\nSea, and the Mediterranean. It nevertheless receives nearly half the\r\nwaters of the old continent, and almost all the new, because the Andes\r\nand Rocky Mountains, which form the watershed of the American continent,\r\nlie along its western side, and the rivers which rise on the western\r\nslope of the Alleghanies are tributaries to the Mississippi, which comes\r\nindirectly into the Atlantic by the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic Ocean drains the high northern latitudes of America, and\r\nreceives those magnificent Siberian rivers that originate in the Altaï\r\nrange from the Steppe of the Kerghis to the extremity of Kamtchatka, as\r\nwell as the very inferior streams of North European Russia. The running\r\nwaters of the rest of the world flow into the Pacific. The Caspian and\r\nLake Aral are mere salt-water lakes, which receive rivers but emit none.\r\nHowever, nearly one-half of all the running water in Europe falls into\r\nthe Black Sea and the Caspian.\r\n\r\nMountain-torrents gradually lose velocity in their descent to the low\r\nlands by friction, and when they enter the plains their course becomes\r\nstill more gentle, and their depths greater. A slope of one foot in 200\r\nprevents a river from being navigable, and a greater inclination forms a\r\nrapid or cataract. The speed, however, does not depend entirely upon the\r\nslope, but also upon the height of the source of the river, and the\r\npressure of the body of water in the upper part of its course;\r\nconsequently, under the same circumstances, large rivers run faster than\r\nsmall, but in each individual stream the velocity is perpetually varying\r\nwith the form of the banks, the winding of the course, and the changes\r\nin the width of the channel. The Rhone, one of the most rapid European\r\nrivers, has a declivity of one foot in 2620, and flows at the rate of\r\n120 feet in a minute; the sluggish rivers in Flanders have only one-half\r\nthat velocity. The Danube, the Tigris, and the Indus are among the most\r\nrapid of the large rivers. In flat countries rivers are generally more\r\nmeandering, and thus they afford a greater amount of irrigation; the\r\nwindings of the Vistula are nearly equal to nine-tenths of its direct\r\ncourse from its source to its mouth.\r\n\r\nWhen one river falls into another, the depth and velocity are increased,\r\nbut not always proportionally to the width of the channel, which\r\nsometimes even becomes less, as at the junction of the Ohio with the\r\nMississippi. When the angle of junction is very obtuse, and the velocity\r\nof the tributary stream great, it sometimes forces the water of its\r\nprimary to recede a short distance. The Arve, swollen by a freshet,\r\noccasionally drives the water of the Rhone back into the Lake of Geneva;\r\nand it once happened that the force was so great as to make the\r\nmill-wheels revolve in a contrary direction.\r\n\r\nStreams sometimes suddenly vanish, and after flowing underground to some\r\ndistance reappear at the surface, as in Derbyshire. Instances have\r\noccurred of rivers suddenly stopping in their course for some hours, and\r\nleaving their channels dry. On the 26th of November, 1838, the water\r\nfailed so completely in the Clyde, Nith, and Teviot, that the mills were\r\nstopped eight hours in the lower part of their streams. The cause was\r\nthe coincidence of a gale of wind and a strong frost, which congealed\r\nthe water near their sources. Exactly the contrary happens in the\r\nSiberian rivers, which flow from south to north over so many hundreds of\r\nmiles; the upper parts are thawed, while the lower are still frozen, and\r\nthe water, not finding an outlet, inundates the country.\r\n\r\nThe alluvial soil carried down by streams is gradually deposited as\r\ntheir velocity diminishes; and if they are subject to inundations, and\r\nthe coast flat, it forms deltas at their mouths; there they generally\r\ndivide into branches, which often join again, or are united by\r\ntransverse channels, so that a labyrinth of streams and islands is\r\nformed. Deltas are sometimes found in the interior of the continents at\r\nthe junction of rivers, exactly similar to those on the ocean, though\r\nless extensive: deltas are said to be maritime, lacustrine, or\r\nfluviatile, according as the stream that forms them falls into the sea,\r\na lake, or another river.\r\n\r\nTides flow up rivers to a great distance, and to a height far above the\r\nlevel of the sea: the tide is perceptible in the river of the Amazons\r\n576 miles from its mouth, and it ascends 255 miles in the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nIn the temperate zones rivers are subject to floods from autumnal rains,\r\nand the melting of the snow, especially on mountain-ranges. The Po, for\r\nexample, spreads desolation far and wide over the plains of Lombardy;\r\nbut these torrents are as variable in their recurrence and extent as the\r\nclimate which produces them. The inundations of the rivers in the torrid\r\nzone, on the contrary, occur with a regularity peculiar to a region in\r\nwhich meteoric phenomena are uniform in all their changes. These floods\r\nare due to the periodical rains, which, in tropical countries, follow\r\nthe cessation of the trade-winds after the vernal equinox and at the\r\nturn of the monsoons, and are thus dependent on the declination of the\r\nsun, the immediate cause of all these variations. The melting of the\r\nsnow no doubt adds greatly to the floods of the tropical rivers which\r\nrise in high mountain-chains, but it is only an accessory circumstance;\r\nfor although the snow-water from the Himalaya swells the streams\r\nconsiderably before the rains begin, yet the principal effect is owing\r\nto the latter, as the southern face of the Himalaya is not beyond the\r\ninfluence of the monsoon, and the consequent periodical rains, which\r\nbesides prevail all over the plains of India traversed by the great\r\nrivers and their tributaries.\r\n\r\nUnder like circumstances, the floods of rivers, whose sources have the\r\nsame latitude, take place at the same season; but the periods of the\r\ninundations of rivers on one side of the equator are exactly the\r\ncontrary of what they are in rivers on the other side of it, on account\r\nof the declination of the sun. The flood in the Orinoco is at its\r\ngreatest height in the month of August, while that of the river of the\r\nAmazons, south of the equinoctial line, is at its greatest elevation in\r\nMarch.[117] The commencement and end of the annual inundations in each\r\nriver depend upon the mean time of the beginning, and on the duration of\r\nthe rains in the latitudes traversed by its affluents. The periods of\r\nthe floods in such rivers as run towards the equator are different from\r\nthose flowing in an opposite direction; and as the rise requires time to\r\ntravel, it happens at regular but different periods in various parts of\r\nthe same river, if very long. The height to which the water rises in the\r\nannual floods depends upon the nature of the country, but it is\r\nwonderfully constant in each individual river where the course is long;\r\nfor the inequality in the quantity of rain in a district drained by any\r\nof its affluents is imperceptible in the general flood, and thus the\r\nquantity of water carried down is a measure of the mean humidity of the\r\nwhole country comprised in its basin from year to year. By the admirable\r\narrangement of these periodical inundations the fresh soil of the\r\nmountains, borne down by the water, enriches countries far remote from\r\ntheir source. The waters from the high lands designated as the Mountains\r\nof the Moon, and of Abyssinia, have fertilized the banks of the Nile\r\nthrough a distance of 2500 miles for thousands of years.\r\n\r\nWhen rivers rise in mountains, water communication between them in the\r\nupper parts of their course is impossible; but when they descend to the\r\nplains, or rise in the low lands, the boundaries between the countries\r\ndrained by them become low, and the different systems may be united by\r\ncanals. It sometimes happens in extensive and very level plains, that\r\nthe tributaries of the principal streams either unite or are connected\r\nby a natural canal, by which a communication is formed between the two\r\nbasins—a circumstance advantageous to the navigation and commerce of\r\nboth, especially where the junction takes place far inland, as on the\r\nOrinoco and Amazons in the interior of South America. The Rio Negro, one\r\nof the largest affluents of the latter, is united to the Upper Orinoco\r\nin the plains of Esmeralda by the Cassiquiare—a stream as large as the\r\nRhine, with a velocity of 12 feet in a second. Baron Humboldt observes\r\nthat the Orinoco, sending a branch to the Amazons, is, with regard to\r\ndistance, as if the Rhine should send one to the Seine or Loire. At some\r\nfuture period this junction will be of great importance. These\r\nbifurcations are frequent in the deltas of rivers, but very rare in the\r\ninterior of continents. The Mahamuddy and Godavery, in Hindostan, seem\r\nto have something of the kind; and there are several instances in the\r\ngreat rivers of the Indo-Chinese peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe hydraulic system of Europe is eminently favourable to inland\r\nnavigation, small as the rivers are in comparison with those in other\r\nparts of the world; but the flatness of the great plain, and the lowness\r\nof its watershed, are very favourable to the construction of canals. In\r\nthe west, however, the Alps and German mountains divide the waters that\r\nflow to the Atlantic on one side, and to the Mediterranean and Black Sea\r\non the other; but in the eastern parts of Europe the division of the\r\nwaters is merely a more elevated ridge of the plain itself, for in all\r\nplains such undulations exist, though often imperceptible to the eye.\r\nThis watershed begins on the northern declivity of the Carpathian\r\nMountains, about the 23d meridian, in a low range of hills running\r\nbetween the sources of the Dnieper and the tributaries of the Vistula,\r\nfrom whence it winds in a tortuous course along the plain to the Valdai\r\ntable-land, which is its highest point, 1200 feet above the sea; it then\r\ndeclines northward towards Onega, about the 60th parallel, and lastly\r\nturns in a very serpentine line to the sources of the Kama in the Ural\r\nmountains near the 62d degree of north latitude. The waters north of\r\nthis line run into the Baltic and White Sea, and, on the south of it,\r\ninto the Black Sea and the Caspian.\r\n\r\nThus, Europe is divided into two principal hydraulic systems; but since\r\nthe basin of a river comprehends all the plains and valleys drained by\r\nit and its tributaries from its source to the sea, each country is\r\nsubdivided into as many natural divisions or basins as it has primary\r\nrivers, and these generally comprise all the rich and habitable parts of\r\nthe earth, and are the principal centres of civilization, or are capable\r\nof becoming so.\r\n\r\nThe streams to the north of the general watershed are very numerous;\r\nthose to the south are of greater magnitude. The systems of the Volga\r\nand Danube are the most extensive in Europe; the former has a basin\r\ncomprising 640,000 square miles, and is navigable throughout the greater\r\npart of its course of 1900 miles. It rises in a small lake on the slopes\r\nof the Valdai table-land, 550 feet above the level of the ocean, and\r\nfalls into the Caspian, which is 83 feet 7 inches below the level of the\r\nBlack Sea, so that it has a fall of 633 feet in a course of more than\r\n2400 miles. It carries to the Caspian one-seventh of all the river-water\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nDanube drains 300,000 square miles, and receives 60 navigable\r\ntributaries. Its quantity of water is nearly as much as that of all the\r\nrivers that empty themselves into the Black Sea taken together. Its\r\ndirect course is 900 miles, its meandering line is 2400. It rises in the\r\nBlack Forest at an elevation of 2850 feet above the level of the sea, so\r\nthat it has considerable velocity, which, as well as rocks and rapids,\r\nimpedes its navigation in many places, but it is navigable downwards,\r\nthrough Austria, for 600 miles, to New Orsova, from whence it flows in a\r\ngentle current to the Black Sea. The commercial importance of these two\r\nrivers is much increased by their flowing into inland seas. By canals\r\nbetween the Volga and the rivers north of the watershed, the Baltic and\r\nWhite Seas are connected with the Black Sea and the Caspian; and the\r\nBaltic and Black Sea are also connected by a canal between the Don and\r\nthe Dnieper. Altogether, the water system of Russia is the most\r\nextensive in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Holland is a collection of deltoid islands, formed by the\r\nRhine, the Meuse, and the Scheldt—a structure very favourable to\r\ncommerce, and which has facilitated an extensive internal navigation.\r\nThe Mediterranean is already connected with the North Sea by the canal\r\nwhich runs from the Rhone to the Rhine; and this noble system, extended\r\nover the whole of France by 7591 miles of inland navigation, has\r\nconduced mainly to the improved state of that great country.\r\n\r\nMany navigable streams rise in the Spanish mountains; of these the Tagus\r\nhas depth enough for the largest ships as high as Lisbon. Its actual\r\ncourse is 480 miles, but its direct line much less. In point of\r\nmagnitude, however, the Spanish rivers are of inferior order, but canals\r\nhave rendered them beneficial to the country. Italy is less favoured in\r\nher rivers, which only admit vessels of small burthen; those on the\r\nnorth are by much the most important, especially the Po and its\r\ntributaries, which by canals connect Venice and Milan with various\r\nfertile provinces of Northern Italy but whatever advantages nature has\r\nafforded to the Italian states have been improved by able engineers,\r\nboth in ancient and modern times.\r\n\r\nThe application of the science of hydraulics to rivers took its rise in\r\nNorthern Italy, which has been carried to such perfection in some\r\npoints, that China is the only country which can vie with it in the\r\npractice of irrigation. The lock on canals was in use in Lombardy as\r\nearly as the 13th century, and in the end of the 15th it was applied to\r\ntwo canals which unite the Ticino to the Adda, by that great artist and\r\nphilosopher Leonardo da Vinci: about the same time he introduced the use\r\nof the lock into France.[118]\r\n\r\nVarious circumstances combine to make the British rivers more useful\r\nthan many others of greater magnitude. The larger streams are not\r\nencumbered with rocks or rapids; they all run into branches of the\r\nAtlantic; the tides flow up their channels to a considerable distance;\r\nand above all, though short in their course, they end in wide estuaries\r\nand sounds, capable of containing whole navies—a circumstance that gives\r\nan importance to streams otherwise insignificant, when compared with the\r\ngreat rivers of either the old or new continent.\r\n\r\nThe Thames, whose basin is only 5027 square miles, and whose length is\r\nbut 240 miles, of which, however, 204 are navigable, spreads its\r\ninfluence over the remotest parts of the earth; its depth is sufficient\r\nto admit large vessels even up to London, and throughout its navigable\r\ncourse a continued forest of masts display the flags of every nation:\r\nits banks, which are in a state of perfect cultivation, are the seat of\r\nthe highest civilization, moral and political. Local circumstances have\r\nundoubtedly been favourable to this superior development, but the\r\nearnest and energetic temperament of the Saxon races has rendered the\r\nadvantages of their position available. The same may be said of other\r\nrivers in the British islands, where commercial enterprise and activity\r\nvie with that on the Thames. There are 2790 miles of canal in Britain,\r\nand, including rivers, 5430 miles of inland navigation, which, in\r\ncomparison with the size of the country, is very great; it is even said\r\nthat no part of England is more than 15 miles distant from water\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Europe is fortunate with regard to its water systems, and\r\nits inhabitants are for the most part alive to the bounties which\r\nProvidence has bestowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            AFRICAN RIVERS.\r\n\r\nIn Africa the tropical climate and the extremes of aridity and moisture\r\ngive a totally different character to its rivers. The most southerly\r\npart is comparatively destitute of them, and those that do exist are of\r\ninferior size, except the Gariep, or Orange River, which has a long\r\ncourse on the table-land, but is nowhere navigable. From the eastern\r\nedge of the table-land of South Africa, which is very abrupt, rise all\r\nthose rivers which flow across the plains of Mozambique and Zanguebar to\r\nthe Indian Ocean. Of these, the Zambesi, or Quillimane, is probably the\r\nlargest: it is said to have a course of 900 miles, and to be navigable\r\nduring the rains for 200 or 300 miles from its mouth. The Ozay, not far\r\nsouth of the equator, is also believed to be of great extent, and the\r\nJuba, more to the north; all these streams have little water at their\r\nmouths during the dry season, but in the rainy season they are\r\nnavigable. Some of those still farther north do not reach the sea at all\r\ntimes of the year, but end in lakes and marshes, as the Haines and\r\nHawash. The first, after coming to within a small distance of the Indian\r\nOcean, runs southward parallel to the coast, and falls into a very large\r\nand deep lake about a degree north of the equator. Between the Hawash\r\nand the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb there is no river of any note. In many\r\nparts of the coast, near the rivers, grain ripens all the year, yielding\r\nfrom 80 to 150 fold, and every eastern vegetable production might be\r\nraised. The Hawash runs through a low desert country inhabited by the\r\nDankali Beduins: that river is the recipient of the waters which come\r\nfrom the eastern declivity of the table-land of Abyssinia, while the\r\nNile receives those of the counter slope.\r\n\r\nThe part of the table-land between the 18th parallel of south latitude\r\nand the equator is the origin from whence the waters flow to the\r\nAtlantic on one hand, and to the Mediterranean on the other. Those which\r\ngo to the Atlantic rise south of Lake N’yassi, chiefly in a ridge of no\r\ngreat elevation which runs from S.W. to N.E. to the west of the\r\ndominions of the Cambeze, and, after falling in cascades and rapids\r\nthrough the chains that border the table-land on the west, fertilize the\r\nluxuriant maritime plains of Benguela, Congo, Angola, and Loando. The\r\nZaire, or Congo, by much the largest of these, is navigable for 140\r\nmiles, where the ascent of the tide is stopped by cataracts. The lower\r\ncourse of this river is 5 or 6 miles broad, full of islands, and 160\r\nfathoms deep at its mouth. Its upper course, like that of most of these\r\nrivers, is unknown; the greater number are fordable on the table-land,\r\nbut, from the abrupt descent of the high country to the maritime plains,\r\nnone of them afford access to the interior of South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe mountainous edge of the table-land, with its terminal projections,\r\nSenegambia and Abyssinia, which separate the northern from the southern\r\ndeserts, are the principal source of running water in Africa. Various\r\nrivers have their origin in these mountainous regions, of which the Nile\r\nand the Niger yield in size only to some of the great Asiatic and\r\nAmerican rivers. In importance and historical interest the Nile is\r\ninferior to none.\r\n\r\nTwo large rivers unite their streams to form the Nile—the Bahr-el-Abiad,\r\nor White Nile, and the Bahr-el-Azrek, or Blue Nile; but the latter is so\r\nfar inferior to the Bahr-el-Abiad that it may almost be regarded as a\r\ntributary. The main stream has never been ascended by any traveller\r\nabove 4° 42ʹ 42ʺ north latitude, where a ledge of gneiss crossing it\r\narrested the progress of the second expedition sent by the Viceroy of\r\nEgypt to discover its source. Bahr-el-Abiad, or the true Nile, is\r\nsupposed, from the report of the natives, to rise, under the name of the\r\nTubiri, at a comparatively small distance from the sea, in the country\r\nof Mono Moézi, which is a continuation of the high plateau of Abyssinia,\r\nsituate to the north of the great Lake Zambéze, or N’yassi. The natives\r\nsay that it flows from the lake itself; at all events it seems to be\r\npretty certain that its origin is in the mountainous or hilly country of\r\nMono Moézi, a word which in all the languages of that part of Africa\r\nsignifies the Moon: hence, the Nile has been said, since the days of\r\nPtolemy, to rise in the Mountains of the Moon. Amidst many windings it\r\ntakes a general direction towards the N.E. to the 14th northern\r\nparallel, whence it follows the same course till its junction near\r\nKhartum with the Blue Nile in the plains of Sennaar.\r\n\r\nThe Shoaberri and Godjeb, the chief affluents of the White Nile, come\r\nfrom the east; the former makes a great circuit round the country of\r\nBerri before it falls into the Nile, and the Godjeb, which has its\r\norigin in the great forest already mentioned, in the Galla country,\r\nsouth of Abyssinia, makes a similar spiral détour round Kaffa, and under\r\nthe name of Subat joins the Nile, which it enlarges to nearly double its\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThe Abyssinian branch of the Nile, known as the Bahr-el-Azrek, or Blue\r\nRiver, rises under the name of the Dedhesa in the Galla country, south\r\nof Abyssinia, about 73 miles west of Sokka, the capital of Enarea. It\r\nsprings from a swampy meadow in the same elevated plains where the\r\nGodjeb and other affluents of the White Nile originate, and after a\r\ncompletely spiral course, in which it separates the kingdoms of Guma and\r\nEnarea, it maintains a general north-westerly direction till it joins\r\nthe White Nile at Khartum. Of the many tributaries to the Blue River,\r\nthe Abái, the Nile of Bruce, is the greatest and most celebrated. Its\r\nsources are in a swampy meadow near Mount Giesk, in the district of\r\nSákkata, from whence it takes a circular direction round the peninsula\r\nof Gojam, passing through Lake Dembea, and receiving many affluents from\r\nthe mountain-chain that forms the cone of the peninsula, and at last\r\nfalls into the Dedhesa or Bahr-el-Azrek, in about 11° N. latitude. From\r\nthat point no stream of any consequence joins either the Blue River, or\r\nthe united streams of the Blue and White Rivers, till 160 miles below\r\ntheir confluence, where the Atbarah, or Takkazie, falls into it. This\r\nriver, which is the principal tributary of the Nile, is formed by two\r\nbranches. The Takkazie rises in the mountains of Lasta, near Lalíbata,\r\none of the most celebrated places in Abyssinia, remarkable for its\r\nchurches hewn out of the living rock, and the Tselari, which springs\r\nfrom Mount Biála, the northern extremity of the high land of Lasta,\r\nwhich divides the head waters of the two branches. The united stream,\r\nafter winding like the other rivers of this country, joins the Nile in\r\n18° N. latitude, the northern limit of the tropical rains.\r\n\r\nThe Abyssinian rivers in the early part of their course are little more\r\nthan muddy brooks in the dry season, but during the rains they inundate\r\nthe plains. They break from the table-lands through fissures in the\r\nrocky surface, which are at first only a few yards wide, but gradually\r\nincrease to several miles; the streams form cataracts from 80 to more\r\nthan 100 feet high, and then continue to descend by a succession of\r\nfalls and rapids, which decrease in height as they go northwards to join\r\nthe main stream. The Takkazie takes its name of “The Terrible” from the\r\nimpetuosity with which it rushes through the chasms and over the\r\nprecipices of the mountains.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity of most of the principal affluents of the Nile is their\r\nspiral course, so that, after having formed a curve of greater or less\r\nextent, generally round insulated mountain masses, they return upon\r\nthemselves at a short distance from their sources. It is by no means\r\nimprobable that the head stream of the Nile itself takes a spiral course\r\nround a lofty mountain mass, similar to the snow-clad mountains of\r\nSámien and Káffa.[119]\r\n\r\nFrom the Takkazie down to the Mediterranean, a distance of 1200 miles,\r\nthe Nile does not receive a single brook. The first part of that course\r\nis interrupted by cataracts, from the geological structure of the Nubian\r\ndesert, which consists of a succession of broad sterile terraces,\r\nseparated by ranges of rocks running east and west. Over these the Nile\r\nfalls in nine or ten cataracts, the last of which is at Es-Souan\r\n(Syene), where it enters Egypt. Most of them are only rapids, where each\r\nsuccessive fall of water is not a foot high. That they were higher at a\r\nformer period has recently been ascertained by Dr. Lepsius, the very\r\nintelligent traveller sent by the King of Prussia at the head of a\r\nmission to explore that country. He found a series of inscriptions on\r\nthe rocks at Sennaar, marking the height of the Nile at different\r\nperiods; and it appears from these, that in that country the bed of the\r\nriver had been 30 feet higher than it is now.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles below Cairo, and at 90 miles from the sea, the Nile is\r\ndivided into two branches, of which one, running in a northerly\r\ndirection, enters the Mediterranean below Rosetta; the other, cutting\r\nLower Egypt into two nearly equal parts, enters the sea above Damietta,\r\nso that the delta between these two places has a sea-coast of 187 miles.\r\nThe fall from the great cataract to the sea is two inches in a mile.\r\n\r\nThe basin of the Nile, occupying an area of 500,000 square miles, has an\r\nuncommon form: it is wide in Ethiopia and Nubia, but for the greater\r\npart of a winding course of 2750 miles it is merely a verdant line of\r\nthe softest beauty, suddenly and strongly contrasted with the dreary\r\nwaste of the Red Desert. Extending from the equatorial far into the\r\ntemperate zone, its aspect is less varied than might have been expected\r\non account of the parched and showerless country it passes through.\r\nNevertheless, from the great elevation of the origin of the river, the\r\nupper part has a perpetual spring, though within a few degrees of the\r\nequator. At the foot of the table-land of Abyssinia the country is\r\ncovered with dense tropical jungles, while the rest of the valley is\r\nrich soil, the detritus of the mountains for thousands of years.\r\n\r\nAs the mean velocity of the Nile, when not in flood, is about two miles\r\nand a half an hour, a particle of water would take twenty-two days and a\r\nhalf to descend from the junction of the Takkazie to the sea; hence, the\r\nretardation of the annual inundations of the Nile in its course is a\r\npeculiarity of this river, owing to some unknown cause towards its\r\norigin which affects the whole stream. In Abyssinia and Sennaar the\r\nriver begins to swell in April, yet the flood is not sensible at Cairo\r\ntill towards the summer solstice; it then continues to rise about a\r\nhundred days, and remains at its greatest height till the middle of\r\nOctober, when it begins to subside, and arrives at its lowest point in\r\nApril and May. The height of the flood in Upper Egypt varies from 30 to\r\n35 feet; at Cairo it is 23, and in the northern part of the delta only 4\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nAnubis, or Sirius, the Dog-star, was worshipped by the Egyptians, from\r\nits supposed influence on the rising of the Nile. According to\r\nChampollion, their calendar commenced when the heliacal rising of that\r\nstar coincided with the summer solstice—the time at which the Nile began\r\nto swell at Cairo. Now this coincidence made the nearest approach to\r\naccuracy 3291 years before the Christian era; and as the rising of the\r\nriver still takes place precisely at the same time and in the same\r\nmanner, it follows that the heat and periodical rains in Upper Ethiopia\r\nhave not varied for 5000 years. In the time of Hipparchus, the summer\r\nsolstice was in the sign of Leo, and probably about that period the\r\nflowing of the fountains from the mouths of lions of basalt and granite\r\nwas adopted as emblematical of the pouring forth of the floods of the\r\nNile. The emblem is still common in Rome, though its origin is probably\r\nforgotten, and the signs of the Zodiac have moved backwards more than\r\n30°.\r\n\r\nThe two greatest African rivers, the Nile and the Niger, are dissimilar\r\nin almost every circumstance; the Nile, discharging for ages into a sea,\r\nthe centre of commerce and civilization, has been renowned by the\r\nearliest historians, sacred and profane, for the exuberant fertility of\r\nits banks, and for the learning and wisdom of their inhabitants, who\r\nhave left magnificent and imperishable monuments of their genius and\r\npower. Egypt was for ages the seat of science, and by the Red Sea it had\r\nintercourse with the most highly cultivated nations of the east from\r\ntime immemorial. The Niger, on the contrary, though its rival in\r\nmagnitude, and running through a country glowing with all the brilliancy\r\nof tropical vegetation, has ever been inhabited by barbarous or\r\nsemi-barbarous nations; and its course till lately was little known, as\r\nits source still is. In early ages, before the Pillars of Hercules had\r\nbeen passed, and indeed long afterwards, the Atlantic coast of Africa\r\nwas an unknown region, and thus the flowing of the Niger into that\r\nlonely ocean kept the natives in their original rude state. Such are the\r\neffects of local circumstances on the intellectual advancement of man.\r\n\r\nThe sources of the Niger, Joliba, or Quorra, are supposed to be on the\r\nnorthern side of the Kong Mountains, in the country of Bambarra, more\r\nthan 1600 feet above the level of the sea. From thence it runs north,\r\nand, after passing through Lake Debo, makes a wide circuit in the plains\r\nof Soudan to Timbuctoo through eight or nine degrees of latitude: then\r\nbending round, it again approaches the Kong Mountains, at the distance\r\n1000 miles in a straight line from its source; and having threaded them,\r\nit flows across the low lands into the Gulf of Guinea, a course of 2300\r\nmiles. In the plains of Soudan it receives many very large affluents\r\nfrom the high land of Senegambia on the west, and the Tchadda on the\r\neast—a navigable river larger than itself, probably the outlet of the\r\ngreat lake Tchad, which drains the high land of Komri, designated by the\r\nancients as the Mountains of the Moon, and falls into it a little below\r\nFundah, after a course of some hundred miles: thus, the Niger probably\r\naffords an uninterrupted water-communication from the Atlantic to the\r\nheart of Africa.[120] Long before leaving the plains of Soudan it\r\nbecomes a noble river with a smooth stream, gliding at the rate of from\r\n5 to 8 miles an hour, varying in breadth from 1 to 8 miles. Its banks\r\nare studded with densely populous towns and villages, groves of\r\npalm-trees, and cultivated fields.\r\n\r\nThis great river divides into three branches near the head of a delta\r\nwhich is equal in area to Ireland, intersected by navigable branches of\r\nthe principal stream in every direction. The soil is rich mould, and the\r\nvegetation so rank that the trees seem to grow out of the water. The\r\nNun, which is the principal or central branch, flows into the sea near\r\nCape Formosa, and is that which the brothers Lander descended. There\r\nare, however, six rivers which run into the Bight of Benin, all\r\ncommunicating with the Niger, and with one another. The old Calabar is\r\nthe most eastern; it rises in the high land of Calbongos, and is united\r\nto the Niger by a natural canal. The Niger, throughout its long winding\r\ncourse, lies entirely within the tropic of Cancer, and is consequently\r\nsubject to periodical inundations, which reach their greatest height in\r\nAugust, about 40 or 50 days after the summer solstice. The plains of\r\nSoudan are then covered with water and crowded by boats. These fertile\r\nregions are inaccessible to Europeans from the pernicious climate, and\r\ndangerous from the savage condition of many of the tribes.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Guinea, west from the Niger, is watered by many streams, of\r\nno great magnitude, from the Kong Mountains. The table-land of\r\nSenegambia is the origin of the Rio Grande, the Gambia, the Senegal, and\r\nothers of great size; and also of many of an inferior order that\r\nfertilize the luxuriant maritime plains on the Atlantic. Their navigable\r\ncourse is cut short by a semicircular chain of mountains which forms the\r\nboundary of the high land, through which they thread their way in rapids\r\nand cataracts. The Gambia rises in Foula Toro, and after a course of\r\nabout 600 miles enters the Atlantic by many branches connected by\r\nnatural channels, supposed at one time to be separate rivers. The\r\nSenegal, the largest river in this part of Africa, is 850 miles long. It\r\nreceives many tributaries in the upper part of its course, and the lower\r\nis full of islands. It drains two lakes, has several tributaries, and is\r\nunited to the basin of the Gambia by the river Neriko.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nAsiatic Rivers—Euphrates and Tigris—River Systems South of the Himalaya—\r\n  Chinese Rivers—Siberian Rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE only river system of importance in Western Asia is that of the\r\nEuphrates and Tigris. In the basin of these celebrated streams,\r\ncontaining an area of 230,000 square miles, immense mounds of earth, in\r\na desolate plain, point out the sites of some of the most celebrated\r\ncities of antiquity—of Nineveh and Babylon. Innumerable remains and\r\ninscriptions, the records of times very remote, have been discovered by\r\nadventurous travellers, and bear testimony to the truth of some of the\r\nmost interesting pages of history. The Euphrates, and its affluent the\r\nMerad-Chaï (supposed to be the stream forded, as the Euphrates, by the\r\nTen Thousand in their retreat), rise in the heart of Armenia, and, after\r\nrunning 1800 miles on the table-land to 38° 41ʹ of north latitude, they\r\njoin the northern branch of the Euphrates, which rises in the Gheul\r\nMountains, near Erzeroum. The whole river then descends in rapids\r\nthrough the Taurus chain, north of Romkala, to the plains of\r\nMesopotamia.\r\n\r\nThe Tigris rises in the mountains to the N. and W. of Dyarbekir, and\r\nafter receiving several tributaries from the high lands of Kurdistan, it\r\npierces the Taurus range about 100 miles above Mosul, from whence it\r\ndescends in a tortuous course through the plain of ancient Assyria,\r\nreceiving many streams from the Tyari mountains, inhabited by the\r\nNestorian Christians, and, farther south, from those of Luristan. The\r\ncountry through which it flows is rich in cornfields, date-groves, and\r\nforest-trees.[121] Near to the city of Bagdad the Tigris and Euphrates\r\napproach to within 12 miles, where they were once connected by two great\r\ncanals. From this point they run nearly parallel for more than 100\r\nmiles, encircling the plain of Babylon or Southern Mesopotamia—the\r\nmodern Irak-Arabi. The two rivers unite at Korna, and form one stream,\r\nwhich, under the name of Shat-el-Arab, runs for 150 miles before it\r\nfalls into the Persian Gulf. The banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, once\r\nthe seat of an extensive population, and of art, civilization, and\r\nindustry, are now nearly deserted, covered with brushwood and grass,\r\ndependent on the rains alone for that luxuriant vegetation which, under\r\nan admirable system of irrigation, formerly covered them. Excepting the\r\nlarge centres of population, Bagdad and Mosul, the inhabitants consist\r\nof nomade Kurdish tribes. What remains of civilization has taken refuge\r\nin the mountains, where the few traces of primitive and most ancient\r\nChristianity, under the misapplied denomination of Nestorian Christians,\r\nare to be found in the Tyari range. The floods of the rivers are very\r\nregular in their period; beginning in March, they attain their greatest\r\nheight in June.\r\n\r\nThe Persian Gulf may be navigated by steam all the year, the Euphrates\r\nonly eight months; it might, however, afford easy intercourse with\r\neastern Asia, as it did in former times. The distance from Aleppo to\r\nBombay by the Euphrates is 2870 miles, of which 2700, from Bir to\r\nBombay, are by water; in the time of Queen Elizabeth this was the common\r\nroute to India, and a fleet was then kept at Bir, expressly for that\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\nSix rivers of the first magnitude descend from the southern side of the\r\ntable-land of eastern Asia and its mountain barriers, all different in\r\norigin, direction, and character, while they convey to the ocean a\r\ngreater volume of water than all the rivers of the rest of the continent\r\nconjointly. Of these, the Indus, the double system of the Ganges, and\r\nBrahmapootra, and the three parallel rivers in the Indo-Chinese\r\npeninsula, water the plains of southern Asia; the great system of rivers\r\nthat descend from the eastern terraces of the table-land irrigates the\r\nfertile lands of China; and lastly, the Siberian rivers, not inferior to\r\nany in magnitude, carry the waters of the Altaï and northern slope of\r\nthe table-land to the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe hard-fought battles and splendid victories recently achieved by\r\nBritish valour over a bold and well-disciplined foe have added to the\r\nhistorical interest of the Indus and its tributary streams, now the\r\nboundaries of our Asiatic territories.\r\n\r\nThe sources of the Indus were only ascertained in 1812; the Ladak, the\r\nlargest branch of the Indus, has its origin in the snowy mountains of\r\nKarakorum; and the Shyook, which is the smaller stream, rises in the\r\nKentese or Gangri range, a ridge parallel to the Himalaya, which extends\r\nalong the table-land of Tibet, north and west of the sacred lake of\r\nMánasarowar. These two streams join north-west of Ladak and form the\r\nIndus; the Sutlej, its principal tributary, springs from the lake of\r\nRakas Tal, which communicates with that of Mánasarowar, both situated in\r\na valley between the Himalaya and Gangri chain at the great elevation of\r\n15,200 feet. These rivers, fed by streams of melted snow from the\r\nnorthern side of the Himalaya, both flow westward along the extensive\r\nlongitudinal valley of western Tibet. The Sutlej breaks through the\r\nHimalaya about the 75th meridian, and traverses the whole breadth of the\r\nchain, in frightful chasms and clefts in the rocks, to the plains of the\r\nPunjab; the Indus, after continuing its course on the table-land through\r\nseveral degrees of longitude farther, descends near the junction of the\r\nHimalaya and the Hindoo Coosh, west of the valley of Cashmere, to the\r\nsame plain. Three tributaries—the Jelum or Hydaspes, the Chenab or\r\nAcescines, and the Ravee or Hydraötes, all superior to the Rhone in\r\nsize—flow from the southern face of the Himalaya, and with the Sutlej\r\n(the ancient Hyphasis) join the Indus before it reaches Mittun; hence\r\nthe name Punjab, “the plain of the five rivers,” now one of the most\r\nvaluable countries in the East. From Mittun to the ocean, the Indus,\r\nlike the Nile, does not receive a single accessary, from the same cause—\r\nthe sterility of the country through which it passes. The Cabul river,\r\nwhich rises near Guzni, and is joined by a larger affluent from the\r\nsouthern declivities of the Hindoo Coosh, flows through picturesque and\r\ndangerous defiles, and joins the Indus at the town of Attock, and is the\r\nonly tributary of any magnitude that comes from the west.\r\n\r\nThe Indus is not favourable to navigation: for 70 miles after it leaves\r\nthe mountains the descent in a boat is dangerous, and it is only\r\nnavigable for steam-vessels of small draught of water; yet, from the\r\nfertility of the Punjab, and the near approach of its basin to that of\r\nthe Ganges at the foot of the mountains, it must ultimately be a\r\nvaluable acquisition, and the more especially because it commands the\r\nprincipal roads between Persia and India, one through Cabul and\r\nPeshawer, and the other from Herat through Candahar. The delta of the\r\nIndus, formerly celebrated for its civilization, has long been a desert;\r\nbut from the luxuriance of the soil, and the change of political\r\ncircumstances, it may again resume its pristine aspect. It is 60 miles\r\nlong, and presents a face of 120 miles to the sea at the Gulf of Oman,\r\nwhere the river empties itself by many mouths, of which only three or\r\nfour are navigable: one only can be entered by vessels of 50 tons, and\r\nall are liable to change. The tide ascends them with extraordinary\r\nrapidity for 75 miles, and so great is the quantity of mud carried by\r\nit, and the absorbing violence of the eddies, that a vessel wrecked on\r\nthe coast was buried in sand and mud in two tides. The annual floods\r\nbegin with the melting of the snow in the Himalaya in the end of April,\r\ncome to their height in July, and end in September. The length of this\r\nriver is 1500 miles, and it drains an area of 400,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe second group of South Indian rivers, and one of the greatest, is the\r\ndouble system of the Ganges and Brahmapootra. These two rivers, though\r\nwide apart at their courses, have their sources little removed from each\r\nother, on opposite sides of the central ridge of the Himalaya, and\r\nwhich, converging to a common delta, constitute one of the most\r\nimportant groups on the globe.\r\n\r\nMr. Alexander Elliot, of the Body Guard in Bengal, son of Admiral\r\nElliot, with his friends, are the first who have accomplished the\r\narduous expedition to the sources of the Ganges. The river flows at once\r\nin a very rapid stream not less than 40 yards across, from a huge cave\r\nin a perpendicular wall of ice at the distance of about three marches\r\nfrom the Temple of Gungoo-tree, to which the pilgrims resort. Mr. Elliot\r\nsays, “The view from the glacier was perfectly amazing; beautiful or\r\nmagnificent is no word for it,—it was really quite astonishing. If you\r\ncould fancy a bird’s-eye of all the mountains in the world in one\r\ncluster, and every one of them covered with snow, it would hardly give\r\nyou an idea of the sight which presented itself.”\r\n\r\nMany streams from the southern face of the Himalaya unite at Hurdwar to\r\nform the great body of the river. It flows from thence in a\r\nsouth-easterly direction through the plains of Bengal, receiving in its\r\ncourse the tribute of 19 or 20 rivers, of which 12 are larger than the\r\nRhine. About 220 miles in a direct line from the Bay of Bengal, into\r\nwhich the Ganges flows, the innumerable channels and branches into which\r\nit splits form an intricate maze over a delta twice as large as that of\r\nthe Nile.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmapootra, a river equal in the volume of its waters to the\r\nGanges, may be considered as the continuation of the Dzangho Tchou or\r\nriver of Lassa, which rises near the sources of the Sutlej and the\r\nIndus, in long. 82° E. After watering the great longitudinal valley of\r\neastern Tibet, it makes a sudden bend to the south in long. 90° E.,\r\ncutting through the Himalaya chain, as the Indus does at its opposite\r\nextremity between Iskasdo and Attock; after which it receives several\r\ntributaries from the northern mountains of the Birman empire; but very\r\nlittle is known of this part of its basin. The upper part of the\r\nBrahmapootra is parallel to the Himalaya chain, until it enters Upper\r\nAssam, where, passing through the sacred pool of Brahma-Koond, it\r\nreceives the name which it bears in the lower part of its course—\r\nBrahmapootra, the “off-spring of Brahma:” the natives call it the Lahit,\r\nSanscrit for the “Red River.” In Upper Assam, through which it winds 500\r\nmiles, and forms some extensive channel islands, it receives six very\r\nconsiderable accessories, of which the origin is unknown, though some\r\nare supposed to come from the table-land of Tibet. They are only\r\nnavigable in the plains, but vessels of considerable burthen ascend the\r\nparent stream as far as Sundiva. Before it enters the plains of Bengal,\r\nbelow Goyalpara, the Brahmapootra runs with rapidity and in great\r\nvolume, and, after receiving the rivers of Bhotan and other streams,\r\nbranches of it unite with those of the Ganges about 40 miles from the\r\ncoast, but the two rivers enter the sea by different mouths, though they\r\nsometimes approach within two miles. The length of the Brahmapootra is\r\nprobably 860 miles, so that it is 500 miles shorter than the Ganges: the\r\nvolume of water discharged by it during the dry season is about 146,188\r\ncubic feet in a second; the quantity discharged by the Ganges in the\r\nsame time, and under the same circumstances, is 80,000 cubic feet. In\r\nthe perennial floods the quantity of water poured through the\r\ntributaries of the Brahmapootra from their snowy sources is incredible;\r\nthe plains of Upper Assam are an entire sheet of water from the 15th of\r\nJune to the 15th of September, and there is no communication but by\r\nelevated causeways eight or ten feet high: the two rivers, with their\r\nbranches, lay the plain of Bengal under water for hundreds of miles\r\nannually. They begin first to swell from the melting of the snow on the\r\nmountains, but, before their inferior streams overflow from that cause,\r\nall the lower parts of Bengal adjacent to the Ganges and Brahmapootra\r\nare under water from the swelling of these rivers by the rains. The\r\nincrease is arrested before the middle of August, by the cessation of\r\nthe rains in the mountains, though they continue to fall longer on the\r\nplains. The delta is traversed in every direction by arms of the rivers.\r\nThe Hoogly branch, at all times navigable, passes Calcutta and\r\nChandernagor; and the Hauringotta arm is also navigable, as well as the\r\nGanges, properly so called. The channels, however, are perpetually\r\nchanging, from the strength of the current, and the prodigious quantity\r\nof matter washed from the high lands; the Ganges alone carries to the\r\nsea 600,000 cubic feet of mud in a second, the effects of which are\r\nperceptible 60 miles from the coast. The elevation of the mountains, and\r\nindeed of the land generally, must have been enormous, since it remains\r\nstill so stupendous after ages of such degradation. The Sunderbunds, a\r\ncongeries of innumerable river islands formed by the endless streams and\r\nnarrow channels of the rivers, as well as by the indentations of arms of\r\nthe sea, line the coast of Bengal for 180 miles, a wilderness of jungle\r\nand heavy timber. The united streams of the Ganges and Brahmapootra\r\ndrain an area of 650,000 square miles, and there is scarcely a spot in\r\nBengal more than 20 miles distant from a river navigable even in the dry\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThese three great rivers of Southern India do not differ more widely in\r\ntheir physical circumstances than in the races of men who inhabit their\r\nbanks, yet from their position they seem formed to unite nations the\r\nmost varied in their aspect and speech. The tributaries of the Ganges\r\nand Indus come so near to each other at the foot of the mountains, that\r\na canal only two miles long would unite them, and thus an inland\r\nnavigation from the Bay of Bengal to the Gulf of Oman might be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nAn immense volume of water is poured in a series of nearly parallel\r\nrivers of great magnitude, and running in the direction of the meridian\r\nthrough the Indo-Chinese peninsula, to empty themselves into the ocean\r\non either side of the peninsula of Malacca. They rise in those elevated\r\nregions at the south-eastern angle of the table-land of Tibet, the lofty\r\nbut unknown provinces of the Chinese empire, and water the great valleys\r\nthat extend nearly from north to south with perfect uniformity, between\r\nchains of mountains no less uniform, which spread out like a fan as they\r\napproach the sea. Scarcely anything is known of the origin or upper\r\nparts of these rivers, and, with a few exceptions, almost as little of\r\nthe lower.\r\n\r\nTheir number amounts to six or seven, all large, though three surpass\r\nthe rest—the Irawady, which waters the Birman empire, and falls into the\r\nBay of Bengal at the Gulf of Martaban; the Menam, or river of Siam; and\r\nthe river Cambodja, which flows through the empire of Annam: the last\r\ntwo fall into the Gulf of Siam and the China Sea.\r\n\r\nThe sources of the Irawady are in the same chain of mountains with the\r\neastern affluents of the Brahmapootra more to the south. Its course is\r\nthrough countries hardly known to Europeans, but it seems to be\r\nnavigable by boats before coming to the city of Amarapoora, south of\r\nwhich it enters the finest and richest plain of the empire, containing\r\nits four capital-cities. There it receives two large affluents, one from\r\nthe Chinese province of Yun-nan, which flows into the Irawady at the\r\ncity of Ava, 446 miles from the sea, the highest point attained by the\r\nBritish forces during the Burmese war.\r\n\r\nFrom Ava to its delta the Irawady is a magnificent river, more than four\r\nmiles broad in some places, but encumbered with channel islands. In this\r\npart of its course it receives its largest tributary, and forms in its\r\ndelta one of the most extensive systems of internal navigation. The\r\nRangoon is the only one of its 14 mouths that is always navigable, and\r\nin it the commerce of the empire is concentrated. The internal\r\ncommunication is extended by the junction of the two most navigable\r\ndeltoid branches with the rivers Salüaen and Pegu by natural canals:\r\nthat joining the former is 200 miles long; the canal uniting the latter\r\nis only navigable at high water.\r\n\r\nThe Menam, one of the largest Asiatic rivers, is less known than the\r\nIrawady; it comes from the Chinese province of Yun-nan, and runs through\r\nthe kingdom of Siam, which it cuts into several islands by many\r\ndiverging branches, and enters the Gulf of Siam by three principal arms,\r\nthe most easterly of which forms the harbour of Bangkok. It is joined to\r\nthe Menam Kong, or Cambodja, by the small river Anan-Myit.\r\n\r\nThe river of Cambodja has the longest course of any in the peninsula: it\r\nis supposed to be the Lantsan-Kiang, which rises in the high land of\r\nK’ham, in eastern Asia, not far from the sources of the great Chinese\r\nriver, the Yang-tse-Kiang. After transversing the elevated plain of\r\nYun-nan, where it is navigable, it rushes through the mountain barriers,\r\nand, on reaching a wider valley about 300 miles from its mouth, it is\r\njoined to the Menam by the natural canal of the Anan-Myit. More to the\r\nsouth it is said to split into branches which unite again.\r\n\r\nThe ancient capital of Annam is situate on the Cambodja, about 150 miles\r\nfrom the sea; a little to the south its extensive delta begins, projects\r\nfar into the ocean, and is cut in all directions by arms of the river,\r\nnavigable during the floods; three of its mouths are permanently so for\r\nlarge vessels up to the capital. The Saüng, more to the east, is much\r\nshorter than the Cambodja, though said to be 1000 miles long, but\r\nEuropeans have not ascended higher than the town of Sai-gon. Near its\r\nmouth it sends off several branches to the eastern arm of the Cambodja.\r\nAll rivers of this part of Asia are subject to periodical inundations,\r\nwhich fertilize the plains at the expense of the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe parallelism of the mountain-chains constitutes formidable barriers\r\nbetween the upper basins of the Indo-Chinese rivers, and decided lines\r\nof separation between the inhabitants of the intervening valleys; but\r\nthis inconvenience is in some degree compensated by the natural canals\r\nof junction and the extensive water communication towards the mouths of\r\nthe rivers.\r\n\r\nFour great systems of rivers take their origin on the eastern declivity\r\nof the great table-land of central Asia, and running from west to east,\r\ntraverse the Chinese empire:—the Hong-Kiang, which, rising in the\r\nprovince of Yun-nan, empties itself into the bay of Canton; the\r\nYang-tse-Kiang, or Son of the Ocean; the Hoang-Ho; and the great river\r\nof Amur.\r\n\r\nThe length of the Hoang-Ho is 2000 miles, that of the Yang-tse-Kiang\r\n2900. Though near their sources they are widely separated by the\r\nmountain-chains that border the table-land, they approach as they\r\nproceed on their eastern course, and are not more than 100 miles apart\r\nwhen they enter the Yellow Sea. From a map constructed by the Jesuit\r\nmissionaries in the 18th century, it appears that the mouth of the\r\nHoang-Ho or Yellow River has shifted to the enormous distance of 126\r\nleagues from its former position. The Yang-tse-Kiang and the Yellow\r\nRiver, in the lower part of their course, are united by innumerable\r\ncanals, forming the grandest system of irrigation and of internal\r\nnavigation in existence.\r\n\r\nThe Hoang-Ho brings down so large a quantity of earthy matter to the\r\nsea, that, like the Tiber of old, it is called the “Yellow” River.\r\n\r\nStrong tides ascend these rivers to the distance of 400 miles, and for\r\nthe time prevent the descent of the fresh water, which forms large\r\ninterior seas frequented by thousands of trading-vessels, and they\r\nirrigate the productive lands of central China, from time immemorial the\r\nmost highly cultivated and the most densely-peopled region of the globe.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the Chinese rivers of less note—and they are numerous—feed\r\nthese giant streams, with the exception of the Ta-si or Hong-Kiang and\r\nthe Pee-ho or White River, which have their own basins. The former,\r\nrising to the east of the town of Yun-nan, flows through the plains of\r\nCanton eastward to the Gulf of Canton, into which it discharges itself,\r\nincreased in its course by the Sekiang.\r\n\r\nThe White River, rising in the mountains near the Great Wall, becomes\r\nnavigable a few miles east of Pekin, unites with the Eu-ho, joins the\r\nGreat Canal, and, as the tide ascends it for 80 miles, it is crowded\r\nwith shipping.\r\n\r\nThe Amur, the sources of which are partly in the Russian dominions,\r\nthough its course is chiefly in the Mantchoo territory of China, is 2000\r\nmiles long, including its windings, and has a basin of 853,000 square\r\nmiles. Almost all its tributaries come from that part of the Baikalian\r\ngroup called the Yablonnoi Khrebit by the Russians, and Khing-Khan-Oola\r\nby the Chinese. The river Onon, which is the parent stream, has its\r\norigin in the Khentai Khan, a branch of the latter; and though its\r\ncourse is through an uninhabited country, it is celebrated as being the\r\nbirthplace and the scene of the exploits of Tshingis Khan. After passing\r\nthrough the lake of Dalai-nor, which is 210 miles in circumference, it\r\ntakes the name of Argun, and forms the boundary between the Chinese and\r\nRussians for 400 miles; it is then joined by the Shilka, where it\r\nassumes the Tunguse name of the Amur or Great River: the Mandchoos call\r\nit the Sagalin or Black Water. It receives most of the unknown rivers\r\nwhich come from the mountain-slopes of the Great Gobi, and falls into\r\nthe Pacific opposite to the island of Sagalin, after having traversed\r\nthree degrees of latitude and thirty-three of longitude.\r\n\r\nThree great rivers, the Lena, the Yenessei, and the double system of the\r\nIrtish and Oby, not inferior in size to any of the rivers of Asia, carry\r\noff the waters of the Altaï chain, and of the mountains which bound the\r\nnorthern border of the great Asiatic table-land. The Lena, whose basin\r\noccupies 800,000 square miles, springs from mountains north of the Lake\r\nof Baikal, and runs north-east through more than half its course to the\r\nSiberian town of Yakutzk, the coldest town on the face of the earth,\r\nreceiving in its course the Vitim and the Olekma, its two principal\r\naffluents, the former from the Baikal mountains, the latter from\r\nStannovoi Khrebit, the most southerly part of the Aldan range. North of\r\nYakutzk, about the 63d degree of latitude, the Lena receives the Aldan,\r\nits greatest tributary, which also comes from the Stannovoi Khrebit; it\r\nthen goes to the Arctic Ocean, between banks of frozen mud, prodigious\r\nmasses of which are hurled down by the summer floods, and bring to view\r\nthe bones of those huge animals of extinct species which at some remote\r\nperiod had found their nourishment in these desert plains. The length of\r\nthe Lena, including its windings, is 1900 miles.\r\n\r\nA difference in the pressure of the air has been observed on the banks\r\nof this river, on the shores of the Sea of Okhotzk, and at Kamchatka;\r\nwhich indicates that in the distance of five degrees of latitude there\r\nis an apparent difference in the level of the sea amounting to 139\r\nfeet.[122] A similar phenomenon was observed by Captain Foster near Cape\r\nHorn, and by Sir James Ross throughout the South Polar Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Yenessei, a much larger river than the Lena, drains about 1,000,000\r\nsquare miles, and is formed by the union of the Great and Little Kem.\r\nThe former rises at the junction of the Sayansk range, with the\r\nBaikalian mountains to the north-west of Lake Kassagol; the latter comes\r\nfrom the Egtag or Little Altaï, in quite an opposite direction, so that\r\nthese two meet nearly at right angles, and take the name of Yenessei; it\r\nthen crosses the Sagaetses range in cataracts and rapids, entering the\r\nplains of Siberia below the town of Krasnojarsk. Below this many rivers\r\njoin it, chiefly the Angara from the Lake Baikal; but its greatest\r\ntributaries, the Upper and Lower Tunguska, both large rivers from the\r\nBaikalian mountains, join it lower down, the first to the south, the\r\nlatter to the north of the town of Yeniseisk, whence it runs north to\r\nthe Icy Ocean, there forming a large gulf, its length, measured along\r\nits bed, being 2500 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Oby rises in the Lake of Toleskoi, “the Lake of Gold,” in Great\r\nTartary; all the streams of the Lesser Altaï unite to swell it and its\r\ngreat tributary the Irtish. The rivers which come from the northern\r\ndeclivity of the mountains go to the Oby, those from the western side to\r\nthe Irtish, which springs from numerous streams on the south-western\r\ndeclivity of the Little Altaï, and run westward into Lake Zaidzan, 200\r\nmiles in circumference. Issuing from thence, it takes a westerly course\r\nto the plain on the north of Semipolatinsk. In the plain it is joined by\r\nthe Tobol, which crosses the steppe of the Kirghiz Cossacks from the\r\nUral Mountains, and soon unites with the Oby; the joint stream then\r\nproceeds to the Arctic Ocean in 67° N. lat. The Oby is 2000 miles long,\r\nand the basin of these two rivers occupies a third part of Siberia.\r\n\r\nBefore the Oby leaves the mountains, at a distance of 1200 miles from\r\nthe Arctic Ocean, its surface has an absolute elevation of not more than\r\n400 feet, and the Irtish, at the same distance, is only 72 feet higher;\r\nboth are consequently sluggish. When the snow melts they cover the\r\ncountry like seas; and as the inclination of the plains in the middle\r\nand lower parts of their course is not sufficient to carry off the\r\nwater, those immense lakes and marshes are formed which characterize\r\nthis portion of Siberia.\r\n\r\nThe bed of the Oby is very deep, and there are no soundings at its\r\nmouth; hence, the largest vessels might ascend at least to its junction\r\nwith the Irtish. Its many affluents also might admit ships, did not the\r\nclimate form an insurmountable obstacle the greater part of the year.\r\nIndeed all Siberian rivers are frozen annually for many months, and even\r\nthe ocean along the Arctic coasts is rarely disencumbered from ice;\r\ntherefore these vast rivers never can be important as navigable streams;\r\nbut towards the mountains they afford water communication from the\r\nsteppe of Issim to the Pacific. They abound in fish and water-fowl, for\r\nwhich the Siberian braves the extremest severity of the climate.\r\n\r\nLocal circumstances have nowhere produced a greater difference in the\r\nhuman race than in the basins of the great rivers north and south of the\r\ntable-land of eastern Asia. The Indian, favoured by the finest climate,\r\nand a soil which produces the luxuries of life, intersected with rivers\r\nnavigable at all seasons, and affording easy communication with the\r\nsurrounding nations, attained early a high degree of civilization; while\r\nthe Siberian and Samoide, doomed to contend with the rigours of the\r\npolar blasts in order to obtain mere existence, have never risen beyond\r\nthe lowest grade of humanity; but custom softens the rigour of this\r\nstern life, so that even here a share of happiness is enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nRiver Systems of North America—Rivers of Central America—Rivers of South\r\n  America and of Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH America is divided into four distinct water systems by the Rocky\r\nMountains, the Alleghanies, and a table-land which contains the great\r\nlakes, and separates the rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean from\r\nthose which go to the Gulf of Mexico. This table-land, which is a level,\r\nnowhere more than 1200 or 1500 feet above the surface of the sea, is the\r\nwatershed of the Mackenzie, the Mississippi, the St. Lawrence, and of\r\nthe rivers that flow into Hudson’s Bay. The St. Lawrence rises under the\r\nname of the St. Louis in 47° 43ʹ N. lat. and 93° W. long.; after joining\r\nthe Lakes Superior, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, it issues from the last by\r\nthe name of the Iroquois, and, expanding in its north-easterly course\r\ninto Lakes St. Francis, St. Louis, and St. Peter, it is first known as\r\nthe St. Lawrence at Montreal, from whence it runs north-east into the\r\nAtlantic, and ends in an estuary 100 miles wide. It has a basin of\r\n297,600 square miles, of which 94,000 are covered with water, exclusive\r\nof the many lesser lakes with which it is in communication.\r\n\r\nNorth of the watershed there is an endless and intricate labyrinth of\r\nlakes and rivers, almost all connected with one another. But the\r\nprincipal streams of these Arctic lands are—the Great Fish River, which\r\nflows north-east in a continued series of dangerous and all but\r\nimpassable rapids to the Arctic Ocean at Melville Strait; the\r\nCopper-mine River, of much the same character, which, after traversing\r\nmany lakes, enters the Icy Sea at George the Fourth’s Gulf; and the\r\nMackenzie River, a stream of greater magnitude, formed by the confluence\r\nof the Peace River and the Athabasca from the Rocky Mountains, which,\r\nafter flowing north over 16 degrees of latitude, enters the Frozen Ocean\r\nin the Esquimaux country beyond the Arctic Circle. All these rivers are\r\nfrozen more than half the year, and the Mackenzie, in consequence of its\r\nlength and direction from south to north, is subject to floods like the\r\nSiberian rivers, because its lower course remains frozen for several\r\nhundred miles long after the upper part is thawed, and the water,\r\nfinding no outlet, flows over the ice and inundates the plains.\r\n\r\nSouth of the table-land the valley of the Mississippi extends for 1000\r\nmiles, and this greatest of North American rivers has its origin in the\r\njunction of streams from the small lakes Itaska and Ussawa, on the\r\ntable-land at no greater height than 1500 feet above the sea. Before\r\ntheir junction these streams frequently spread out into sheets of water,\r\nand the Mississippi does the same in the upper part of its course. This\r\nriver flows from north to south through more degrees of latitude than\r\nany other, and receives so many tributaries of the higher orders that it\r\nwould be difficult even to name them. Among those that swell its volume\r\nfrom the Rocky Mountains, the Missouri, the Arkansas, and the Red River\r\nare the largest, each being in itself a mighty stream, receiving\r\ntributaries without number. Before their junction the Missouri is a\r\nstream much superior to the Mississippi both in length and volume, and\r\nhas many affluents larger than the Rhine. It rises in about 44° N. lat.,\r\nand runs partly in a longitudinal valley of the Rocky Mountains, and\r\npartly at their foot, and drains the whole of the country on the right\r\nbank of the Mississippi between the 49th and 40th parallels of north\r\nlatitude. It descends in cataracts through the mountain regions, and in\r\nthe plains it sometimes passes through large prairies and sometimes\r\nthrough dense forests, in all accomplishing 3000 miles in a very\r\ntortuous and generally south-eastern direction till it joins the\r\nMississippi near the town of St. Louis. Lower down, the Mississippi is\r\njoined by the Arkansas, 2000 miles long, with many tributaries, and then\r\nby the Red River, the former from the Rocky Mountains; the latter, which\r\nrises in the table-land of New Mexico, is fed by rivers from the Sierra\r\ndel Sacramento, and enters the main stream not from the beginning of the\r\ndelta, at the head of which the Mississippi sends off a large branch\r\ncalled the Atchafalaya to the south, and then turning to the east it\r\ndischarges itself by five mouths at the extremity of a long tongue of\r\nland which stretches 50 miles into the Gulf of Mexico, having formed a\r\ndelta considerably larger than that of the Nile. The shore is lined with\r\nshallow salt lagoons; the greater part of the delta is covered with\r\nwater and unhealthy marshes, the abode of the alligator, and during the\r\nfloods it is a muddy sea. This river is navigable for 2240 miles. Its\r\nvalley is of variable width, but at its greatest width, at the junction\r\nof the White River, it is 80 miles.\r\n\r\nThe tributaries from the Rocky Mountains, though much longer, run\r\nthrough countries of less promise than those which are traversed by the\r\nOhio and the other rivers that flow into the Mississippi on the east,\r\nwhich offer advantages unrivalled even in this wonderful country, only\r\nbeginning to be developed.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio is formed by the union of the rivers Alleghany and Monongahela,\r\nthe latter from the Laurel ridge of the Alleghany chain in Virginia; the\r\nformer comes from sources near Lake Erie, and the two unite at\r\nPittsburg, from whence the river winds 948 miles through some of the\r\nfinest states of the Union, till its junction with the Mississippi,\r\nhaving received many accessories, six of which are navigable streams.\r\nThere are some obstacles to navigation in the Ohio, but they have been\r\navoided by canals. Other canals join both the Mississippi and its\r\nbranches with Lake Erie, so that there is an internal water\r\ncommunication between the St. Lawrence and the Gulf of Mexico. The whole\r\nlength of the Mississippi is 3160 miles, but, if the Missouri be\r\nconsidered the main stem, it is 4265, and the joint stream drains an\r\narea of about a million and a quarter of square miles. The breadth of\r\nthe river nowhere corresponds with its length. At the confluence of the\r\nMissouri each river is half a mile wide, and after the junction of the\r\nOhio it is not more. A steamer may ascend the Mississippi for 2000 miles\r\nfrom Balize without any perceptible difference in its breadth. The depth\r\nis 168 feet where it enters the Gulf of Mexico at New Orleans: the fall\r\nof the river at Cape Girardeau is four inches in a mile. This river is a\r\nrapid desolating torrent loaded with mud; its violent floods, from the\r\nmelting of the snow in the high latitudes, sweep away whole forests, by\r\nwhich the navigation is rendered very dangerous, and the trees, being\r\nmatted together in masses many yards thick, are carried down by the\r\nspring floods, and deposited over the delta and Gulf of Mexico for\r\nhundreds of square miles.\r\n\r\nNorth America can boast of two other great water systems, one from the\r\neastern versant of the Alleghanies, which flows into the Atlantic, and\r\nanother from the western versant of the Rocky Mountains, which runs into\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\nAll the streams that flow eastward through the United States to the\r\nAtlantic are short, and comparatively small, but of the highest utility,\r\nbecause many of them, especially those to the north, end in gulfs of\r\nvast magnitude, and the whole are so united by canals that few places\r\nare not accessible by water—one of the greatest advantages a country can\r\npossess. There are at least 24 canals in the United States, the\r\n[aggregate] length of which is 3101 miles.\r\n\r\nMany of the streams which ultimately come to the Atlantic rise in the\r\nwestern ridges of the Alleghany chain, and traverse its longitudinal\r\nvalleys before leaving the mountains to cross the Atlantic slope, which\r\nterminates in a precipitous ledge for 300 miles parallel to the range.\r\nBy falling over this rocky barrier in long rapids and picturesque\r\ncascades they afford an enormous and extensive water-power; and as the\r\nrivers are navigable from the Atlantic quite across the maritime plains,\r\nthese two circumstances have determined the location of most of the\r\nprincipal cities of the United States at the foot of this rocky ledge,\r\nwhich, though not more than 300 feet high, has had a greater influence\r\non the political and commercial interests of the Union than the highest\r\nchains of mountains have had in other countries. The Hudson in the north\r\nis navigable to Albany; the Delaware and Susquehanna, ending in bays,\r\nare important rivers; and the Potomac, which falls into Chesapeake Bay,\r\npasses Washington, the capital of the United States, to which the\r\nlargest ships can ascend.\r\n\r\nThe watershed of the Rocky Mountains lies at a greater distance from the\r\nPacific than that of the Alleghanies from the Atlantic; consequently the\r\nrivers are longer, but they are few, and little known; the largest are,\r\nthe Oregon or Colombia, and the Rio Colorado. The former has its sources\r\nnot far from those of the Missouri and of the Rio del Norte; and after\r\nan exceedingly tortuous source, in which it receives many tributaries,\r\nit falls into the Pacific at Astoria. The Colorado is a Mexican stream,\r\nwhich comes from the Sierra Verde and falls into the Gulf of California.\r\nThe Sacramento with its tributaries, a Californian stream, lying between\r\nthe two, and much inferior to either, has been brought into notice of\r\nlate from the extensive and rich auriferous country through which it\r\nflows in its course to the Bay of San Francisco on the Pacific.\r\n\r\nOn the table-land of Mexico there is a basin of continental streams,\r\nwhich, rising from springs on the eastern side of the Sierra Madre, and\r\nfed by the periodical rains, flow northward and terminate in lakes,\r\nwhich part with their superfluous water by evaporation. Of these, the\r\nRio Grande, which, after a course of 300 miles, falls into the Parras,\r\nis the greatest.\r\n\r\nThe largest river in the isthmus of Mexico is the Rio de Lerma or Rio\r\nGrande Santiago, which rises on the table-land of Toluca, passes through\r\nLake Chapala, forms numerous cascades, and falls into the Pacific after\r\na course of 400 miles. There are many streams in Central America, and\r\nabove 10 rivers that are navigable for some miles; six of these fall\r\ninto the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and four into the Pacific. Of\r\nthese, the Guasacualco, which traverses the Isthmus nearly from sea to\r\nsea, and which has by some been considered as the best point for a sea\r\ncanal between the two oceans, and the Montagua, which rises in the\r\nmountains near Guatemala: the first empties itself into the Gulf of\r\nMexico, whilst the second flows into the Gulf of Honduras, and has a\r\nlong line of navigation.\r\n\r\nIn the southern part of the State of Guatemala is situated the River of\r\nSan Juan, which drains the Lakes of Nicaragua and Leon, and by which it\r\nis supposed a water communication could be easily effected between the\r\nAtlantic and the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe Andes, the extensive watershed of South America, are so close to the\r\nsea, that there are no rivers of considerable size which empty\r\nthemselves into the Pacific; even some of the streams that rise in the\r\nwestern Cordilleras find their way to the eastern plains.\r\n\r\nThe Magdalena, at the northern end of the Andes, though a secondary\r\nriver in America, is 620 miles long. It rises in the central chain, at\r\nthe divergence of the Cordilleras of Suma Paz and Quindiu, and enters\r\nthe Caribbean Sea by various channels; it is navigable as far as Honda.\r\nThe Cauca, its only feeder on the left, comes from Popayan, and is\r\nnearly as large as its primary, to which it runs parallel the greater\r\npart of its course. Many streams join the Magdalena on the right, as the\r\nstream which waters the elevated plain of Bogota, and forms the cataract\r\nof Tequendama, one of the most beautiful and wildest scenes in the\r\nAndes. The river rushes through a chasm 30 feet wide, which appears to\r\nhave been formed by an earthquake, and at a double bound descends 530\r\nfeet into a dark gloomy pool, illuminated only at noon by a few feeble\r\nrays. A dense cloud of vapour rising from it is visible at the distance\r\nof 15 miles. At the top the vegetation is that of a temperate climate,\r\nwhile palms grow at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe river Atrato, parallel to the Cauca and Magdalena, but less\r\nconsiderable, empties itself into the Gulf of Darien. The rivers of\r\nPatia, of San Juan, of Las Esmeraldas, and of Guyaquil, all rise on the\r\nwestern declivity of the Andes to flow into the Pacific. With these\r\nexceptions, all the water from the inexhaustible sources of the Andes\r\nnorth of Chile is poured into the Orinoco, the River of the Amazons, and\r\nthe Rio de la Plata, which convey it eastward across the continent to\r\nthe Atlantic. In the far south, indeed, there are the Colorado and Rio\r\nNegro, but they are insignificant when compared with these giant floods.\r\n\r\nThe basins of these three rivers are separated in their lower parts by\r\nthe mountains and high lands of the Parima and Brazil; but the central\r\nparts of the basins of all three, toward the foot of the Andes, form an\r\nextensive level, and are only divided from one another by imperceptible\r\nelevations in the plains, barely sufficient to form the watersheds\r\nbetween the tributaries of these majestic rivers. This peculiar\r\nstructure is the cause of the natural canal of the Cassiquiare, which\r\njoins the Upper Orinoco with the Rio Negro, a principal affluent of the\r\nAmazons. Ages hence, when the wilds are inhabited by civilized man, the\r\ntributaries of these three great rivers, many of which are navigable to\r\nthe foot of the Andes, will, by means of canals, form a water system\r\ninfinitely superior to any that now exists.\r\n\r\nThe Orinoco, altogether a Colombian river, rises in the Sierra del\r\nParima, 200 miles east of the elevated Peak of Duida, and maintains a\r\nwesterly course to San Fernando de Atabapo, where it receives the\r\nAtabapo, and Guaviare, which is larger than the Danube; here ends the\r\nUpper Orinoco. The river then forces a passage through the Sierra del\r\nParima, and runs due north for three degrees of latitude, between banks\r\nalmost inaccessible; its bed is traversed by dykes, and filled with\r\nboulders of granite and islands clothed with a variety of magnificent\r\npalm-trees. Large portions of the river are here engulfed in crevices,\r\nforming subterranean cascades; and in this part are the celebrated falls\r\nof the Atures and Apures, 36 miles apart, which are heard at the\r\ndistance of many miles. At the end of this tumultuous part of its course\r\nit is joined by the Meta, and farther north by the Apure, two very large\r\nrivers, which drain the whole eastern side of the Andes in an extent of\r\n10 degrees of latitude, and then runs eastward to its mouth, where it\r\nforms an extensive delta and enters the Atlantic by many channels. As\r\nthe Upper Orinoco runs west, and the Lower Orinoco east, it makes a\r\ncomplete circuit round the Parima mountains, so that its mouth is only\r\ntwo degrees distant from the meridian of its sources.\r\n\r\nThe Cassiquiare leaves the Orinoco near the south base of the Peak of\r\nDuida, and joins the Rio Negro, a chief tributary of the Amazons, at the\r\ndistance of 180 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Orinoco is navigable for 1000 miles at all seasons; a fleet might\r\nascend it from the Dragon’s Mouth to within 45 miles of Santa Fé de\r\nBogota. It receives many navigable rivers, of which the Guaviare, the\r\nAtures, and the Meta are each larger than the Danube. The Meta may be\r\nascended to the foot of the Andes; its mean depth is 36 feet, and in\r\nmany places 80 or 90. It rises so high in the Andes that Baron Humboldt\r\nsays the vegetable productions at its source differ as much from those\r\nat its confluence with the Orinoco, though in the same latitude, as the\r\nvegetation of France does from that of Senegal. The larger feeders of\r\nthe Orinoco come from the Andes, though many descend to it from both\r\nsides of the Parima, in consequence of its long circuit among these\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe basin of the Orinoco has an area of 300,000 square miles, of which\r\nthe upper part is impenetrable forest, the lower is Llanos.\r\n\r\nThe floods of the Orinoco, like those of all rivers entirely within the\r\ntorrid zone, are very regular, and attain their height nearly at the\r\nsame time with those of the Ganges, the Niger, and the Gambia. They\r\nbegin to swell about the 25th of March, and arrive at their full and\r\nbegin to decrease on the 25th of August. The inundations are very great,\r\nowing to the quantity of rain that falls in the wooded regions, which\r\nexceeds 100 inches in a year.\r\n\r\nBelow the confluence of the Apure the river is three miles and a quarter\r\nbroad, but during the floods it is three times as much. By the\r\nconfluence of four of its greatest tributaries at the point at which it\r\nbends to the east, a low inland delta is formed, in consequence of which\r\n3600 square miles of the plain are under water during the inundation.\r\nThe Orinoco in many places smells of musk, from the number of dead\r\ncrocodiles.\r\n\r\nUpper Peru is the cradle of the Amazons, the greatest of rivers, which\r\ndrains the chain of the Andes from the equator to the 20th parallel of\r\nsouthern latitude. Its highest branch, which bears the name of Marañon,\r\nissues in two streams from the Lake of Lauricocha in the plain of\r\nBombon, at a great elevation in the Andes: it runs in a deep\r\nlongitudinal valley from south to north, till it bursts through the\r\neastern ridge at the Pongo de Manseriche, near the town of San Borja,\r\nfrom whence it follows an uniform eastern course of nearly 4000 miles\r\nincluding its windings, till it reaches the Atlantic. West of San Borja,\r\nand on its southern bank, it receives the Huallaga and Yucayali, the\r\nlatter a river of great size which rises in the Andes of Vilcañota, S.\r\nof Cusco, where its source was visited and its position determined by\r\nMr. Pentland. The Amazons is supposed to drain an area of two millions\r\nand a half of square miles, which is ten times the size of France. In\r\nsome places it has a great depth; it is navigable 2200 miles from its\r\nsource, and is 96 miles wide at its mouth.\r\n\r\nThe name of the river is three times changed in its course: it is known\r\nas the Marañon from its source to the confluence of the Yucayali; from\r\nthat point to its junction with the Rio Negro, it is called the\r\nSolimoes; and from the Rio Negro till it enters the ocean it is the\r\nRiver of the Amazons.\r\n\r\nThe number, length, and volume of its tributaries are in proportion to\r\nits magnitude; even the affluents of its affluents are noble streams.\r\nMore than 20 superb rivers, navigable almost to their sources, pour\r\ntheir waters into it, and streams of less importance are numberless. Two\r\nof the largest are the Huallaga and the Yucayali: like their primary,\r\nthe former has its origin in the mining district of Pasco, and after a\r\nlong northern course between the Cordilleras it breaks through a gorge\r\nsimilar to that of Manseriche and joins the Marañon in the plains; it is\r\nalmost a mile broad above its junction. The Spanish governor of Peru\r\nsent Pedro de Orsoa down this river in the year 1560 to search for the\r\nLake of Parima and the city of El Dorado. The Yucayali, not inferior to\r\nthe Marañon itself, is believed by some eminent geographers to be the\r\ntrue Marañon. In a course of 1080 miles it is fed by accessaries from a\r\nwide extent of country, and at its junction with the main stream, near\r\nthe mission of San Joaquin de Omaguas, a line of 50 fathoms does not\r\nreach the bottom, and in breadth it is more like a sea than a river. By\r\nthese streams there is access to Peru, and there is communication\r\nbetween the Amazons and the most distant regions around by other\r\nnavigable feeders. Nothing is known of the rivers that empty themselves\r\ninto the Amazon on its southern bank, between the Yucayali and the\r\nMadeira; the latter, which is its greatest affluent, comes near the\r\nsources of the Paraguay, the principal accessary of the Rio de la Plata.\r\nThe River of the Amazons is not less extensively connected on the north.\r\nThe high lands of Colombia are accessible by the Putumayo, the Japura,\r\nand other great navigable rivers; the Rio Negro, nearly nine miles\r\nbroad, a little way above its junction with the Amazons, unites it with\r\nthe Orinoco by the Cassiquiare; and lastly, the sources of the Rio\r\nBranco come very near to those of the Essequibo, an independent river of\r\nDemerara.\r\n\r\nThe main stream, from its mouth nearly throughout its length, is full of\r\nriver islands, and most of its tributaries have deltoid branches at\r\ntheir junction with it. The annual floods of the Amazons are less\r\nregular than those of the Orinoco, and, as the two rivers are in\r\ndifferent hemispheres, they occur at opposite seasons. The Amazons\r\nbegins to rise in December, is at its greatest height in March, and its\r\nleast in July and August. The quantity of rain that falls in the deep\r\nforests traversed by this river is so great that, were it not for the\r\nenormous evaporation, and the streams that carry it off, the country\r\nwould be flooded annually to the depth of eight feet. The Amazons is\r\ndivided into two branches at its mouth, of which one joins the Parà\r\nsouth of the island of Das Joanes or Marajo, the other enters the ocean\r\nto the north of it.\r\n\r\nThe water of some of the rivers in equatorial America is white; in\r\nothers it is of a deep coffee-colour, or dark green when seen in the\r\nshade, but perfectly transparent, and, when ruffled by a breeze, of a\r\nvivid green like some of the Swiss lakes. In Scotland, the brown waters\r\ncome from peat-mosses; but it is not so in America, since they occur as\r\noften in forests as in savannahs. Sir Robert Schomburgk thinks they are\r\nstained by the iron in the granite; however, the colouring matter has\r\nnot been chemically ascertained. The Orinoco and the Cassiquiare are\r\nwhite; Rio Negro, as its name implies, is black, yet the water does not\r\nstain the rocks, which are of a dazzling white. Black waters are\r\nsometimes, though rarely, found on the table-lands of the Andes.\r\n\r\nThe Rio de la Plata forms the third great water system of South America.\r\nThe Rio Grande, its principal stream, rises in the mountains of Minas\r\nGeraes, in Brazil, and runs 500 miles on the table-land from north to\r\nsouth before it takes the name of Paranà. For more than 100 miles it is\r\na continued series of cataracts and rapids, the greatest of which, the\r\nSalta Grande, is in about 24° 5ʹ lat. Above the fall the river is three\r\nmiles broad, when all at once it is confined in a rocky pass only 60\r\nyards wide, through which it rushes over a ledge with thunderous noise,\r\nheard at the distance of many miles. The Paranà receives three large\r\nrivers on the right—the Paraguay, the Pilcomayo, and the Vermejo: all\r\ngenerally tend to the south, and unite at different distances before\r\nentering their primary at Corrientes. The Paraguay, 1200 miles long, is\r\nthe finest of these: in its upper part it is singularly picturesque,\r\nadorned with palms and other tropical vegetation, and its channel\r\nislands are covered with orange-groves. It springs from a chain of seven\r\nlakes, on the southern slopes of the Campos Parecis, in Brazil, and may\r\nbe ascended by vessels of considerable burthen through nineteen degrees\r\nof latitude. The Pilcomayo and Vermejo both come from Bolivia; the\r\nformer traverses the desert of the Gran Chaco, the latter the district\r\nof Tarija. At Santa Fé the La Plata turns eastward, and before entering\r\nthe Atlantic is augmented by the Uruguay from the north, which takes its\r\nname from the turbulence of its streams.\r\n\r\nThe Rio de la Plata is 2700 miles long, and for 200 miles from its\r\nmouth, up to Buenos Ayres, it is never less than 170 miles broad. Were\r\nit not for the freshness of its water it might be mistaken for the\r\nocean: it is, however, shallow, and loaded with mud, which stains the\r\nAtlantic for 200 miles from its mouth.\r\n\r\nThe Paraguay is subject to dreadful floods. In 1812 the atmosphere was\r\npoisoned by the putrid carcases of drowned animals. The ordinary annual\r\ninundations of the Paranà, the principal or upper branch of the La\r\nPlata, cover 36,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the vast extent of the very level plains along the\r\nbase of the Andes, the basins of the three great rivers are apparently\r\nunited. So small are the elevations that determine their direction,\r\nthat, with the exception of a portage of three miles, a vessel might\r\nsail from Buenos Ayres in 35° S. lat. to the mouth of the Orinoco in 9°\r\nN. lat. by inland navigation.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado, which runs in a long shallow stream through the Pampas of\r\nBuenos Ayres to the Atlantic, is formed of two principal branches, one\r\nfrom the west, and the other from the north, which unite at a great\r\ndistance from the Atlantic, into which the river flows.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Negro or Cusu-debu rises at a great elevation, and separates the\r\nPampas from Patagonia. In its long course through arid deserts to the\r\nAtlantic it does not receive a single adjunct, but it forms a\r\ncommunication between that ocean and Chile, as it reaches a pass in the\r\nAndes that is free from snow. There is some vegetation in its immediate\r\nneighbourhood; it has a bar at its mouth, and is navigable only for four\r\nmiles above Carmen; it has floods twice in the year, one from the rains,\r\nthe other from the melting of the snow in the Andes.\r\n\r\nSome other streams from the Chilian Andes run through, but do not\r\nfertilize, the desolate plains of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThere are various rivers in South America, unconnected with those\r\ndescribed, which in any other country would be esteemed of a high order.\r\nOf many which descend from the mountains of Guiana, the Essequibo is the\r\nlargest; its general width is a mile and a quarter; its water, though\r\nblack, is transparent; and on its banks and those of all its adjuncts\r\nthe forest reigns in impenetrable thickness. It rises in the Sierra\r\nAcaray, which separates its basin from that of the Amazons, and, after a\r\nnortherly course, falls into the Atlantic near 7° N. lat. by an outlet\r\n14 miles broad, separated by three low islands into four branches. Sir\r\nRobert Schomburgk, whose scientific journeys have made us acquainted\r\nwith a country of which so little was known, has shown that, by cutting\r\na canal three miles long between the Madeira and Guapore, an affluent of\r\nthe Mamore, an inland navigation might be opened from Demerara to Buenos\r\nAyres, over an extent of 42 degrees of latitude, with the exception of a\r\nportage of only 800 yards in the rainy season between Lake Amucu and the\r\nQuatata, a branch of the Rupununi, which flows into the Essequibo. But\r\nthat is not the only water communication between Guayana and remote\r\ncountries, great though the distance be, for the Napo, a tributary of\r\nthe Solimoes, offers communication with Quito, the Huallaga with Peru\r\nand countries not far distant from the Pacific Ocean. By the Rio Negro,\r\nthe Orinoco, the Cassiquiare, and its tributary the Meta, there is\r\nuninterrupted navigation to New Granada and to within eight miles of\r\nSanta Fé de Bogota. “If,” says the distinguished traveller already\r\nmentioned, “British Guayana did not possess the fertility which is such\r\na distinguishing feature, this water communication alone would render it\r\nof vast importance; but, blessed as it is with abundant fruitfulness,\r\nthis extensive inland navigation heightens its value as a British\r\ncolony; and, if emigration sufficient to make its resources available\r\nwere properly directed thither, the port of Demerara would rival any in\r\nthe vast continent of South America.” It is certainly very remarkable\r\nthat the tide of emigration has never set towards a country of such\r\npromise, abounding in valuable natural productions, and so much nearer\r\nto Great Britain than her colonies in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe Parà and San Francisco are the chief Brazilian rivers: both rise on\r\nthe table-land; the former results from the union of the Tocantins and\r\nAraguay; it descends from the high lands in rapids in its northerly\r\ncourse, and, after running 1500 miles, joins the southern branch of the\r\nAmazons before entering the Atlantic south of the island of Marajo. The\r\nSan Francisco is only 1275 miles long: it rises in the Sierra Canastra\r\nin the province of Minas Geraes, and, after travelling northward between\r\nmountain ranges parallel to the coast, it breaks through them and\r\nreaches the ocean about the 11th degree of S. lat. As in the Appalachian\r\nchain, so here, many rivers come down the edge of the table-land to the\r\nlevel maritime plains of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe historical renown and the high civilization of Asia and Europe,\r\ntheir great wealth and population, may be attributed in a very great\r\ndegree to the facility of transport afforded by their admirable river\r\nsystems, and still more to the genius of the people who knew how to\r\navail themselves of them; the same may be said of the inhabitants of the\r\nUnited States of America, while the Indians who have possessed these\r\ncountries for ages never took advantage of the noble streams with which\r\nProvidence had enriched and embellished them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         RIVERS OF NEW HOLLAND.\r\n\r\nAfter America, the land of the river and the flood, New Holland appears\r\nin more than its usual aridity. The absence of large rivers is one of\r\nthe greatest impediments to the improvement of this continent. What it\r\nmay possess in the interior is not known, but it is certain that no\r\nlarge river discharges its water into the ocean, and most of the small\r\nones are absorbed before they reach it.\r\n\r\nThe streams from the mountains on the eastern side of the continent are\r\nmere torrents, and would have short courses did they not run in\r\nlongitudinal valleys, as, for example, the Hawkesbury. The Murumbidgee,\r\nthe Lachlan, and the Macquarrie, formed by the accumulation of\r\nmountain-torrents, are the largest.\r\n\r\nThe Murumbidgee rises in the ranges west of St. George’s Lake, and,\r\nrunning south-west, meets the Lachlan, of unknown origin, coming from\r\nthe east. After their junction they run into the Murray, a much larger\r\nstream, though only 350 feet broad, and not more than 20 feet deep:\r\nbefore entering the ocean in Encounter Bay, it passes through the\r\nAlexandrine Marsh: it is too shallow even for boats. The Darling is\r\nsupposed to be merely the upper part of the Murray, probably rising\r\ntowards the head of St. Vincent’s Gulf. The origin of the Macquarrie is\r\nunknown: it is called the Fish River between Bathurst and Sydney; after\r\nrunning 600 miles north-west it is lost in the marshes.\r\n\r\nSwan River, on the western side of the continent, has much the same\r\ncharacter; and from that river to the Gulf of Carpentaria, along the\r\nwhole of the western and northern shores of the continent, there are\r\nnone. The want of water makes it hardly possible to explore the interior\r\nof this continent. No country stands more in need of a complete system\r\nof irrigation, which could easily be accomplished from the nature of the\r\nrivers, which lie in deep channels, and might be converted into canals\r\nby dams, from whence the water might be conveyed by channels over the\r\nsurrounding country, as in Lombardy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nLakes—Northern System of the Great Continent—Mountain System of the\r\n  same—American Lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE hollows formed on the surface of the earth by the ground sinking or\r\nrising, earthquakes, streams of lava, craters of extinct volcanos, the\r\nintersection of strata, and those that occur along the edges of the\r\ndifferent formations, are generally filled with water, and constitute\r\nsystems of lakes, some salt and some fresh. Many of the former may be\r\nremnants of an ancient ocean left in the depressions of its beds during\r\nits retreat as the continent arose.\r\n\r\nAlmost all lakes are fed by springs in their beds, and they are\r\noccasionally the sources of the largest rivers. Some have neither\r\ntributaries nor outlets; the greater number have both. The quantity of\r\nwater in lakes varies with the seasons everywhere, especially from the\r\nmelting snow on mountain-chains and in high latitudes, and from\r\nperiodical rains, between the tropics. Small lakes occur in\r\nmountain-passes, formed by water which runs into them from the\r\ncommanding peaks; they are frequently, as in the Alps, very transparent,\r\nof a bright green or azure hue. Large lakes are common on table-lands,\r\nand in the valleys of mountainous countries, but the largest are on\r\nextensive plains. The basin of a lake comprehends all the land drained\r\nby it; consequently it is bounded by an imaginary line passing through\r\nthe sources of all the waters that fall into it.\r\n\r\nThere are more lakes in high than in low latitudes, because evaporation\r\nis much greater in low latitudes than in high, and in this respect there\r\nis a great analogy between the northern plains of the two principal\r\ncontinents. Sheets of water of great beauty occur in the mountain\r\nvalleys of the British islands, of Norway, and Sweden, countries similar\r\nin geological structure; and besides these there are two regions in the\r\nold world in which lakes particularly abound. One begins on the low\r\ncoast of Holland, goes round the southern and eastern sides of the\r\nBaltic, often passing close to its shores, along the Gulf of Bothnia,\r\nand through the Siberian plains to Behring’s Straits. The lakes which\r\ncover so much of Finland and the great lakes of Ladoga and Onega lie in\r\na parallel direction; they occupy transverse rents which had taken place\r\nacross the palæozoic strata, while rising in a direction from S.W. to\r\nN.E., between the Gulf of Finland and the White Sea; that elevation was,\r\nperhaps, the cause of the cavities now occupied by these two seas.\r\nLadoga is the largest lake in this zone, having a surface of nearly 1000\r\nsquare miles. It receives tributary streams, and sends off its\r\nsuperfluous water by rivers, and Onega does the same; but the multitude\r\nof small steppe lakes among the Ural mountains and in the basin of the\r\nriver Obi neither receive nor emit rivers, being for the most part mere\r\nponds, though of great size, some of fresh and some of salt water, lying\r\nclose together—a circumstance which has not been accounted for: those on\r\nthe low Siberian plains have the same character.\r\n\r\nThe second system of lakes in the old continent follows the zone of the\r\nmountain mass, and comprehends those of the Pyrenees, Alps, Apennines,\r\nAsia Minor, the Caspian, the Lake Aral, together with those on the\r\ntable-land and in the mountains of central Asia.\r\n\r\nIn the Pyrenees, lakes are most frequent on the French side; many are at\r\nsuch altitudes as to be perpetually frozen: one on Mont Perdu, 8393 feet\r\nabove the sea, has the appearance of an ancient volcanic crater. There\r\nis scarcely a valley in the Alpine range and its offsets that has not a\r\nsheet of water, no doubt owing to the cavities formed during the\r\nelevation of the ridges, and, in some instances, to subsidence of the\r\nsoil; Lake Trüb, 7200 feet above the level of the sea, is the most\r\nelevated. There are more lakes on the north than on the south side of\r\nthe Alps—the German valleys are full of them. In Bohemia, Gallicia, and\r\nMoravia, there are no less than 30,000 sheets of water, besides great\r\nnumbers throughout the Austrian empire.\r\n\r\nOf the principal lakes on the northern side of the Alps, the Lake of\r\nGeneva, or Lake Leman, is the most beautiful from its situation, the\r\npure azure of the waters, and the sublime mountains that surround it.\r\nIts surface, of about 240 square miles, is 1150 feet above the sea, and\r\nnear Meillerie it is 1012 deep. The lake of Lucerne is 1400 feet above\r\nthe sea, and the lakes of Brienz 1900 feet. The Italian Lakes are at a\r\nlower level; the Lago Maggiore has only 678 feet of absolute altitude;\r\nthey are larger than most of those on the north of the Alps, and, with\r\nthe advantage of an Italian climate, sky, and vegetation, they surpass\r\nthe others in beauty, though the mountains that surround them are less\r\nlofty.\r\n\r\nThese great lakes are fed by rivers rising in the glaciers of the higher\r\nAlps, and many large rivers issue from them. In this respect they differ\r\nfrom most of the lakes in Lower Italy, some of which are craters of\r\nancient volcanos, or perhaps ancient craters of elevation, where the\r\nearth had been swelled up by subterranean vapour without bursting, and\r\nhad sunk down again into a hollow when the internal pressure was\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nIn Syria, the Lake of Tiberias and the Dead Sea, sacred memorials to the\r\nChristian world, are situate in the deepest cavity on the earth. The\r\nsurface of the Lake Tiberias is 329 feet below the level of the\r\nMediterranean, surrounded by verdant plains bearing aromatic shrubs;\r\nwhile the heavy bitter waters of the Dead Sea, 1312 feet below the level\r\nof the Mediterranean, is a scene of indescribable desolation and\r\nsolitude, encompassed by desert sands, and bleak, stony, salt hills.\r\nThus, there is a difference of level of 983 feet in little more than 60\r\nmiles, which makes the course of the river Jordan very rapid. The water\r\nof the Dead Sea is so acrid, from the large proportion of saline matter\r\nit contains, that it irritates the skin: it is more buoyant, and has a\r\ngreater proportion of salt, than any that is known except the small lake\r\nof Eltonsk east of the Volga.[123]\r\n\r\nThough extensive sheets of water exist in many parts of Asia Minor,\r\nespecially in Bithynia, yet the characteristic feature of the country,\r\nand of all the table-land of western Asia and the adjacent steppes, is\r\nthe number and magnitude of the saline lakes. A region of salt lakes and\r\nmarshes extends at least 200 miles along the northern foot of the Taurus\r\nrange, on a very elevated part of the table-land of Anatolia. There are\r\nalso many detached lakes, some exceedingly saline. Fish cannot live in\r\nthe Lake of Toozla; it is shallow, and subject to excessive evaporation.\r\nNeither can any animal exist in the Lake of Shahee or Urmiah, on the\r\nconfines of Persia and Armenia, 300 miles in circumference: its water is\r\nperfectly clear, and contains a fourth part of its weight of saline\r\nmatter. These lakes are fed by springs, rain, and melted snow, and,\r\nhaving no emissaries, the surplus water is carried off by evaporation.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the volcanic soil of the table-land may be the cause\r\nof this exuberance of salt water. Lake Van, a sheet of salt water 240\r\nmiles in circumference, is separated from the equally salt lake Urmiah\r\nonly by a low range of hills; and there are many pieces of fresh water\r\nin that neighbourhood, possibly in similar hollows.\r\n\r\nPersia is singularly destitute of water; the Lake of Zurrah, on the\r\nfrontiers of Afghanistan, having an area of 18 square miles, is the only\r\npiece of water on the western part of the table-land of Iran.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the saline nature of the soil, and the shells it\r\ncontains, that the plains round the Caspian, the Lake Aral, and the\r\nsteppes, even to the Ural Mountains, had once formed part of the Black\r\nSea; 57,000 square miles of that country are depressed below the level\r\nof the ocean—a depression which extends northwards beyond the town of\r\nSaratov, 300 miles distant from the Caspian. The surface of the Caspian\r\nitself, which is 83 feet 7 inches below the level of the ocean, is its\r\nlowest part, and has an area of 18,000 square miles, nearly equal to the\r\narea of Spain. In Europe alone it drains an extent of 850,000 square\r\nmiles, receiving the Volga, the Ural, and other great rivers on the\r\nnorth. It has no tide, and its navigation is dangerous from heavy gales,\r\nespecially from the south-east, which drive the water miles over the\r\nland; a vessel was stranded 46 miles inland from the shore. It is 600\r\nfeet deep to the south, but is shallower to the east where it is bounded\r\nby impassable swamps many miles broad.[124] The Lake of Eltonsk, on the\r\nsteppe east of the Volga, has an area of 130 square miles, and furnishes\r\ntwo-thirds of the salt consumed in Russia. Its water yields 29·13 per\r\ncent. of saline matter, and from this circumstance is more buoyant than\r\nany that is known.[125]\r\n\r\nThe Lake of Aral, which is shallow, is higher than the Caspian, and has\r\nan area of 3372 square miles; it has its name from the number of small\r\nislands at its southern end, Aral signifying “island” in the Tartar\r\nlanguage. Neither the Caspian nor the Lake of Aral have any outlets,\r\nthough they receive large rivers; they are brackish, and, in common with\r\nall the lakes in Persia, they are decreasing in extent, and becoming\r\nmore salt, the quantity of water supplied by tributaries being less than\r\nthat lost by evaporation. Most of the rivers that are tributary to the\r\nLake of Aral are diminished by canals, that carry off water for\r\nirrigation: for that reason a very diminished portion of the waters of\r\nthe Oxus reaches the lake. Besides, the Russian rivers yield less water\r\nthan formerly from the progress of cultivation. The small mountain-lake\r\nSir-i-Kol, in the high table-land of Pamer, from whence the Oxus flows,\r\nis 15,600 feet above the sea; consequently there is a difference of\r\nlevel between it and the Dead Sea of nearly 17,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe small number of lakes in the Himalaya is one of the peculiarities of\r\nthese mountains. The Lake of Ular, in the valley of Cashmere, is the\r\nonly one of any magnitude; it is but 40 miles in circumference, and\r\nseems to be the residue of one that had filled the whole valley at some\r\nearly period. There are many great lakes, both fresh and salt, on the\r\ntable-land; the annular form of Lake Palte, at the northern base of the\r\nHimalaya, as represented on maps, is unexampled; the sacred lakes of\r\nManasarowar, in Great Tibet, and of Rakas Tal, occupy a space of about\r\n400 square miles, in the centre of the Himalaya, between the gigantic\r\npeaks of Gurla on the south and of Kailas on the north; it is from the\r\nwesternmost of these lakes (which communicate with each other), the Cho\r\nLagan of the Tibetians, that the Sutlej rises, at an elevation of 15,200\r\nfeet above the level of the sea. These remarkable lakes mark the point\r\nfrom around which all the great rivers rising in the Himalaya have their\r\norigin. Tibet is full of lakes, many of which produce borax, found\r\nnowhere else but in Tuscany and in the Lipari Islands. As most of the\r\ngreat lakes on the table-land are in the Chinese territories, strangers\r\nhave not had access to them; the Koko-nor and Lake Lop seem to be very\r\nlarge; the latter is said to have a surface of 2187 square miles, and\r\nthere are others not inferior to it in the north. The lakes in the Altaï\r\nare beautiful, larger and more numerous than in any other\r\nmountain-chain. They are at different elevations on the terraces by\r\nwhich the table-land descends to the flats of Siberia, and are, owing to\r\ngeological phenomena, essentially different from those which have\r\nproduced the Caspian and other steppe lakes. They seem to have been\r\nhollows formed where the axes of the different branches of the chain\r\ncross, and are most numerous and deepest in the eastern Altaï. Baikal,\r\nthe largest mountain lake, supposed to owe its origin to the sinking of\r\nthe ground during an earthquake, has an area of 14,800 square miles,\r\nnearly equal to the half of Scotland. It lies buried in the form of a\r\ncrescent, amid lofty granite mountains, which constitute the edge of the\r\ntable-land to the south, ending in the desert of the Great Gobi, and in\r\nthe north-west they gird the shore so closely that they dip into the\r\nwater in many places; 160 rivers and streams fall into this salt lake,\r\nwhich drains a country probably twice the size of Britain. The river\r\nAngara, which runs deep and strong through a crevice at its eastern end,\r\nis its principal outlet, and is supposed to carry off but a small\r\nproportion of its water. Its surface is 1793 feet above the sea-level,\r\nand the climate is as severe as it is in Europe 10° farther north; yet\r\nthe lake does not freeze till the middle of December, possibly from its\r\ndepth, being unfathomable with a line of 600 feet.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and eighty years before the Christian era, the large\r\nfresh-water lake of Oitz, in Japan, was formed in one night, by a\r\nprodigious sinking of the ground, at the same time that one of the\r\nhighest and most active volcanos in that country rose from the depths of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nVery extensive lakes occur in Africa; there appears to be a great number\r\non the low-lands on the east coast of Africa, in which many of the\r\nrivers from the edge of the table-land terminate. Among others, there is\r\nthe salt lake Assal, 25 miles west of Tadjurra, in the country through\r\nwhich the Hawash flows, which has a depression of more than 700 feet\r\nbelow the level of the ocean, by Dr. Beke’s estimation, who first\r\nobserved that curious circumstance; but by the actual measurement of\r\nLieutenant Christopher, it is 570 feet. Notwithstanding the arid soil of\r\nthe southern table-land, it contains the fresh-water lake of N’yassi or\r\nZambeze, one of the largest, being some hundred miles long; and, though\r\nnarrow in proportion, it cannot be crossed in a boat of the country in\r\nless than three days, resting at night on an island, of which there are\r\nmany. It lies between 300 and 400 miles west from the Mozambique\r\nChannel, and begins 200 miles north of the town of Tete, which is\r\nsituate on the river Zambeze, from whence it extends from south-east to\r\nnorth-west, possibly to within a degree or two of the equator. It\r\nreceives the drainage of the country to the south-east: but no river is\r\nknown to flow out of it, unless it be the Bahr-el-Abiad or White Nile,\r\nwhich probably rises in this lake. No one knows what there may be in the\r\nunexplored regions of the Ethiopian desert; but Abyssinia has the large\r\nand beautiful lake of Dembia, situate in a spacious plain—the granary of\r\nthe country—so high above the sea that spring is perpetual, though\r\nwithin the tropics. There are many other lakes in this great projecting\r\npromontory, so full of rivers, mountains, and forests; but the lowlands\r\nof Soudan and the country lying along the base of the northern declivity\r\nof the table-land is the region of African lakes, of which the Tchad,\r\nalmost the size of an inland sea, is in the very centre of the\r\ncontinent. Its extent, and the size of its basin, are unknown; it\r\nreceives many affluents from the high lands called the Mountains of the\r\nMoon, certainly all those that flow from them east of Bornou, and it is\r\nitself drained by the Tchadda, a principal tributary of the Niger. Other\r\nlakes of less magnitude are known to exist in these regions, and there\r\nare probably many more that are unknown. Salt-water lakes are numerous\r\non the northern boundaries of the great lowland deserts, and many fine\r\nsheets of fresh water are found in the valleys and flat terraces of the\r\nGreat and Little Atlas.\r\n\r\nFresh-water lakes are characteristic of the higher latitudes of both\r\ncontinents, but those in the old continent sink into insignificance in\r\ncomparison with the number and extent of those in the new. Indeed a very\r\nlarge portion of North America is covered with fresh water; the five\r\nprincipal lakes—Superior, Huron, Michigan, Erie, and Ontario—with some\r\nof their dependants, probably cover an area of 94,000 square miles; that\r\nof Lake Superior alone, 32,000 which is only 1800 square miles less than\r\nthe whole of England. The American lakes contain more than half the\r\namount of fresh water on the globe. The altitude of these lakes shows\r\nthe slope of the continent; the absolute elevation of Lake Superior is\r\n672 feet; Lake Huron is 30 feet lower; Lake Erie 32 feet lower than the\r\nHuron; and Lake Ontario is 331 feet below the level of Erie. The river\r\nNiagara, which unites the two last lakes, is 33-1/2 miles long, and in\r\nthat distance it descends 66 feet; it falls in rapids through 55 feet of\r\nthat height in the last half-mile, but the upper part of its course is\r\nnavigable. The height of the cascade of Niagara is 162 feet on the\r\nAmerican side of the central island, and 1125 feet wide. On the Canadian\r\nside the fall is 149 feet high, and 2100 feet wide—the most magnificent\r\nsheet of falling-water known, though many are higher. The river St.\r\nLawrence, which drains the whole, slopes 234 feet between the bottom of\r\nthe cascade and the sea. The bed of Lake Superior is 300 feet, and that\r\nof the Ontario 268 feet below the surface of the Atlantic, affording\r\nanother instance of deep indentation in the solid matter of the globe.\r\nSome lakes are decreasing in magnitude, though the contrary seems to be\r\nthe case in America; between the years 1825 and 1838, Ontario rose\r\nnearly seven feet; and, according to the American engineers, Lake Erie\r\nhad gained several feet in the same time. Lake Huron is said to be the\r\nfocus of peculiar electrical phenomena, as thunder is constantly heard\r\nin one of its bays. The lakes north of this group are innumerable; the\r\nwhole country, to the Arctic Ocean, is covered with sheets of water\r\nwhich emit rivers and streams. Lake Winnipeg, Rein-deer Lake, Slave\r\nLake, and some others, may be regarded as the chief members of separate\r\ngroups or basins, each embracing a wide extent of country almost\r\nunknown. There are also many lakes on each side of the Rocky Mountains;\r\nand in Mexico there are six or seven lakes of considerable size, though\r\nnot to be compared with those in North America.\r\n\r\nThere are many sheets of water in Central America, though only one is of\r\nany magnitude, and the Lake of Nicaragua, in the province of that name,\r\nabout 100 miles from the sea, and which communicates with the Gulf of\r\nMexico by the River of San Juan.\r\n\r\nIn Central America, the Andes are interrupted by plains and mere hills\r\non the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and of Nicaragua, on each side of which\r\nthere is a series of lakes and rivers, which, aided by canals, might\r\nform a water communication between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. In\r\nthe former, the line proposed would connect the river Guasacalco, on the\r\nGulf of Mexico, with the Bay of Tehuantepec in the Pacific. In the\r\nIsthmus of Nicaragua, the Gulf of San Juan would be connected by the\r\nriver of that name, and the chain of Lakes of Nicaragua and Leon, with\r\nthe Bay of Realejo or the Gulf of Fonseca, with the Gulf of Costa Rica.\r\nHere the watershed is only 615 feet above the sea, and of easy\r\nexcavation, and the lake, situate in an extensive plain, is deep enough\r\nfor vessels of considerable size.\r\n\r\nA range of lakes goes along the eastern base of the Andes, but the\r\ngreater part of them are mere lagoons or marshes, some very large, which\r\ninundate the country to a great extent in the time of the tropical\r\nrains. There appears to be a deep hollow in the surface of the earth at\r\nthe part where Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay meet, in which lies the\r\nLake Xarayos, extending on each side of the river Paraguay, but, like\r\nmany South American lakes, it is not permanent, being alternately\r\ninundated and dry, or a marsh. Its inundations cover 36,000 square\r\nmiles. Salt and fresh water lakes are numerous on the plains of La\r\nPlata, and near the Andes in Patagonia, resembling, in this respect,\r\nthose in high northern latitudes, though on a smaller scale.\r\n\r\nIn the elevated mountain-valleys and table-lands of the Andes there are\r\nmany small lakes of the purest blue and green colours, intensely cold,\r\nsome being near the line of perpetual congelation. They are generally of\r\nconsiderable depth. The lake of Titicaca, however, in the Bolivian\r\nAndes, has an area of 2225 square miles, of 60 to a degree, and is more\r\nthan 120 fathoms deep in many places, surrounded by splendid scenery.\r\nThough 12,846 feet above the level of the Pacific, and consequently\r\nhigher than the Peak of Teneriffe, its shores are cultivated, producing\r\ncorn, barley, and potatoes; and peopled by a large aboriginal\r\npopulation, inhabiting towns and villages. Numerous vestiges of Peruvian\r\ncivilization are everywhere to be met with; and in the island from which\r\nit derives its name, and where tradition places the origin of the last\r\nInca dynasty, numerous specimens of Peruvian architecture still exist.\r\n\r\nThe limpid transparency of the water in lakes, especially in mountainous\r\ncountries, is remarkable; minute objects are visible at the bottom\r\nthrough many fathoms of water. The vivid green tints so often observed\r\nin Alpine lakes may be produced by vegetable dyes dissolved in the\r\nwater, though chemical analysis has not detected them.\r\n\r\nLakes, being the sources of some of the largest rivers, are of great\r\nimportance for inland navigation as well as for irrigation; while, by\r\ntheir constant evaporation, they maintain the supply of humidity in the\r\natmosphere so essential to vegetation, besides the embellishment a\r\ncountry derives from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTemperature of the earth—Temperature of the Air—Radiation—Foci of\r\n  Maximum Cold—Thermal Equator—Its Temperature, mean and absolute—\r\n  Isothermal Lines—Continental and Insular Climates—Extreme Climates—\r\n  Stability of Climate—Decrease of Heat in Altitude—Line of Perpetual\r\n  Snow—Density of the Atmosphere—The Barometer—Measurement of Heights—\r\n  Variations in Density and their Causes—Horary Variations—Independent\r\n  Effect of the dry and aqueous Atmospheres—Mean height of Barometer in\r\n  different Latitudes—Depression in the Antarctic Ocean and in Eastern\r\n  Siberia—Barometric Storms—Polar and Equatorial Currents of Air—\r\n  Trade-Winds—Monsoons—Land and Sea Breezes—Gyration of the Winds in the\r\n  Extra-Tropical Zones—Winds in Middle European Latitudes—Hurricanes—The\r\n  Laws of their Motion—Their Effect on the Barometer—How to steer clear\r\n  of them—The Storm-Wave—Storm-Currents—Arched Squalls—Tornadoes—\r\n  Whirlwinds—Water Spouts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE atmosphere completely envelops the earth to the height of about 20\r\nmiles; it bulges at the equator, and is flattened at the poles, in\r\nconsequence of the diurnal rotation. It is a mixture of water in an\r\ninvisible state and of air; but the air is not homogeneous; 100 parts of\r\nit consist of 79 parts of hydrogen or azotic gas, and 21 of oxygen, the\r\nsource of combustion and animal heat. Besides these, there is a little\r\nammoniacal vapour, and a small quantity of carbonic acid gas, which is\r\nsufficient to supply all the vegetation on the earth with wood and\r\nleaves. No doubt exhalations of various kinds ascend into the air, such\r\nas those which produce miasmata, but they are in quantities too minute\r\nto be detected by chemical analysis, so that the atmosphere is found to\r\nbe of the same composition at all heights above the sea hitherto\r\nattained.[126]\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the earth’s surface, and the phenomena of the\r\natmosphere, depend upon the revolution and rotation of the earth, which\r\nsuccessively expose all the parts of the earth, and the air which\r\nsurrounds it, to a perpetual variation of the gravitating forces of the\r\ntwo great luminaries, and to annual and diurnal vicissitudes of solar\r\nheat. Atmospheric phenomena are consequently periodical and connected\r\nwith one another, and their harmony, and the regularity of the laws\r\nwhich govern them, become the more evident in proportion as the mean\r\nvalues of their vicissitudes are determined from simultaneous\r\nobservations made over widely-extended tracts of the globe. The\r\nfickleness of the wind and weather is proverbial, but, as the same\r\nquantity of heat is annually received from the sun, and annually\r\nradiated into space, it follows that all climates on the earth are\r\nstable, and that their changes, like the perturbations of the planets,\r\nare limited, and accomplished in fixed cycles, whose periods are still\r\nin many instances unknown. It is possible, however, that the earth and\r\nair may be affected by secular variations of temperature during the\r\nprogress of the solar system through space, or from periodical changes\r\nin the sun’s light and heat, similar to those which take place in many\r\nof the fixed stars. The secular variation in the moon’s mean distance\r\nwill no doubt alter the amount of her attractive force, though probably\r\nby a quantity inappreciable in the aërial tides; at all events,\r\nvariations arising from such circumstances could only become perceptible\r\nafter many ages.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments made by M. Peltier it appears that, if the absolute\r\nquantity of heat annually received by the earth were equally dispersed\r\nover its surface, it would, in the course of a year, melt a stratum of\r\nice 46 feet deep covering the whole globe. It is evident that, if so\r\ngreat a quantity of heat had been continually accumulated in the earth,\r\ninstead of being radiated into space, it would have been transmitted\r\nthrough the surface to the poles, where it would have melted the ice,\r\nand the torrid zone, if not the whole globe, would by this time have\r\nbeen uninhabitable. In fact, every surface absorbs and radiates heat at\r\nthe same time, and the power of radiation is always equal to the power\r\nof absorption, for, under the same circumstances, bodies which become\r\nsoon warm also cool rapidly, and the earth, as a whole, is under the\r\nsame law as the bodies at its surface.\r\n\r\nAlthough part of the heat received from the sun in summer is radiated\r\nback again, by far the greater part sinks into the earth’s surface, and\r\ntempers the severity of the winter’s cold while passing through the\r\natmosphere into the etherial regions.\r\n\r\nThe power of the solar rays depends on the manner in which they fall, as\r\nmay be seen from the difference of climates. The earth is about\r\n3,000,000 of miles nearer to the sun in winter than in summer, but the\r\nrays strike the northern hemisphere more obliquely in winter than in the\r\nother half of the year.\r\n\r\nDiurnal variations of heat are perceptible only to a small distance\r\nbelow the surface of the ground, because the earth is a bad conductor:\r\nthe annual influence of the sun penetrates much farther. At the equator,\r\nwhere the heat is greatest, it descends deeper than elsewhere with a\r\ndiminishing intensity, but there, and everywhere throughout the globe,\r\nthere is a stratum, at a depth varying from 40 to 100 feet below the\r\nsurface of the ground, where the temperature never varies, and is nearly\r\nthe same with the mean temperature of the country over it. This zone,\r\nunaffected by the sun’s heat from above, or by the internal heat from\r\nbelow, serves as an origin whence the effects of solar heat are\r\nestimated on one hand, and the internal temperature of the globe on the\r\nother. Below it the heat of the earth increases, as already mentioned,\r\nat the rate of one degree of Fahrenheit’s thermometer for every 50 or 60\r\nfeet of perpendicular depth; were it to continue increasing at that\r\nrate, every substance would be in a state of fusion at the depth of 21\r\nmiles; hitherto, however, the experiments in mines and Artesian wells,\r\nwhence the earth’s temperature below the constant stratum is\r\nascertained, have not been extended below 1700 feet.\r\n\r\nM. de Beaumont has estimated by the theory of Fourier, from the\r\nobservations of M. Arago, that the quantity of central heat which\r\nreaches the surface of the earth is capable, in the course of a year, of\r\nmelting a shell of ice covering the globe a quarter of an inch\r\nthick.[127]\r\n\r\nThe superficial temperature of the earth is great at the equator, it\r\ndecreases gradually towards the poles, and is an exact mean between the\r\ntwo at the 45th parallel of latitude; but a multitude of causes disturb\r\nthis law even between the tropics. It is affected chiefly by the unequal\r\ndistribution of land and water, by the height above the sea, by the\r\nnature of the soil, and by vegetation, so that a line drawn on a map\r\nthrough all the places where the mean temperature of the earth is the\r\nsame would be very far from coinciding with the parallels of latitude,\r\nbut would approximate more to them near the equator. Between the tropics\r\nthe temperature of the earth’s surface is greater in the interior of\r\ncontinents than on the sea-coasts and islands, and in the interior of\r\nAfrica it is greater than in any other part of the globe.\r\n\r\nTemperature depends upon the property all bodies possess, more or less,\r\nof perpetually absorbing and emitting or radiating heat. When the\r\ninterchange is equal, the temperature of a substance remains the same;\r\nbut when the radiation exceeds the absorption, it becomes colder, and\r\n_vice versâ_. The temperature of the air is certainly raised by the\r\npassage of the solar heat through it, because it absorbs one-third of it\r\nbefore reaching the earth, but it is chiefly warmed by heat transmitted\r\nand radiated from the earth. The radiation is abundant when the sky is\r\nclear and blue, but clouds intercept it; so that a thermometer rises in\r\ncloudy weather, and sinks when the air becomes clear and calm; even a\r\nslight mist diminishes radiation from the earth, because it returns as\r\nmuch heat as it receives. The temperature of the air is subject to such\r\nirregularities from these circumstances, and from the difference in the\r\nradiating powers of the bodies at the surface of the globe, that it is\r\nnecessary to find, by experiment, the mean or average warmth of the day,\r\nmonth, and year, at a great variety of places, in order to have a\r\nstandard by which the temperature in different parallels of latitude may\r\nbe compared.\r\n\r\nThe mean diurnal temperature of the air, at any place, is equal to half\r\nthe sum of the greatest and least heights of the thermometer during 24\r\nhours, and, as the height of the thermometer is twice in the course of\r\nthat time equal to the mean temperature of the place of observation, it\r\nmight seem easy to obtain its value; yet that is not the case, for a\r\nsmall error in observation produces a very great error in such minute\r\nquantities, so that accuracy can only be attained from the average of a\r\ngreat number of observations, by which the errors, sometimes in excess\r\nand sometimes in defect, neutralize or balance each other. The mean\r\nvalue of quantities is a powerful aid to the imperfections of our nature\r\nin arriving at truth in physical inquiries, and in none more than in\r\natmospheric phenomena: almost all the certain knowledge man has acquired\r\nwith regard to the density and temperature of the air, winds, rain, &c.,\r\nhas been acquired by that method.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of any one month at the same place differs from one\r\nyear to another, but the mean temperature of the whole year remains\r\nnearly the same, especially when the average of 10 or 15 years is taken;\r\nfor although the temperature in any one place may be subject to very\r\ngreat variations, yet it never deviates more than a few degrees from its\r\nmean state.[128]\r\n\r\nThe motion of the sun in the ecliptic occasions perpetual variations in\r\nthe length of the day, and in the direction of his rays with regard to\r\nthe earth; yet, as the cause is periodic, the mean annual temperature\r\nfrom the sun’s motion alone must be constant in each parallel of\r\nlatitude. For it is evident that the accumulation of heat in the long\r\ndays in summer, which is but little diminished by radiation during the\r\nshort nights, is balanced by the small quantity of heat received during\r\nthe short days of winter and its radiation in the long frosty and clear\r\nnights. Were the globe everywhere on a level with the surface of the\r\nsea, and of uniform substance, so as to absorb and radiate heat equally,\r\nthe mean heat of the sun would be regularly distributed over its surface\r\nin zones of equal annual temperature parallel to the equator, and would\r\ndecrease regularly to each pole. The distribution of heat, however, in\r\nthe same parallel is very irregular in all latitudes, except between the\r\ntropics, from the inequalities in the level and nature of the surface of\r\nthe earth, so that lines drawn on a map through all places having the\r\nsame mean annual temperature are nearly parallel to the equator only\r\nbetween the tropics; in all other latitudes they deviate greatly from\r\nit, and from one another.[129] Radiation is the principal cause of\r\ntemperature; hence, the heat of the air is most powerfully modified by\r\nthe ocean, which occupies three times as much of the surface of the\r\nglobe as the land, and is more uniform in its surface, and also in its\r\nradiating power. On the land the difference in the radiating force of\r\nthe mountains and table-lands from that of the plains—of deserts from\r\ngrounds covered with rich vegetation—of wet land from dry, are the most\r\ngeneral causes of variation; the local causes of irregularity are beyond\r\nenumeration.\r\n\r\nThere are two points in the northern hemisphere, both in the 80th\r\nparallel of latitude, where the cold is more intense than in any other\r\npart of the globe with which we are acquainted. One north of Canada in\r\n100° W. long. has a temperature of -3°·5 of Fahrenheit; while, at the\r\nSiberian point, in 95° E. long., the temperature of the air is +1°;\r\nconsequently it is four and a half degrees warmer than that north of\r\nCanada—a difference that has an influence even to the equator, where the\r\nmean temperature of the air is different in different longitudes.\r\n\r\nThe line of the maximum temperature of the atmosphere, or the\r\natmospheric thermal equator, which cuts the terrestrial equator in the\r\nmeridians of Otaheite and Singapore, passes through the Pacific in its\r\nsouthern course, and through the Atlantic in its northern, has a mean\r\ntemperature of 83°·84 of Fahrenheit. But by the comparison of many\r\nobservations the mean equatorial temperature of the air is 82°·94 in\r\nAsia, 85°·10 in Africa, and 80°·96 in America: thus, it appears that\r\ntropical Africa is the hottest region on earth. Moreover, the atmosphere\r\nin the tropical zone of the Pacific, when free from currents, is two\r\ndegrees and a quarter warmer than the corresponding zone in the\r\nAtlantic, which is 82°·40.\r\n\r\nOn account of the great extent of ocean, the isothermal lines in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere coincide more nearly with the parallels of latitude\r\nthan in the northern. In the Antarctic Ocean the only flexure is\r\noccasioned by the cold of the south polar current, which flows along the\r\nwestern coast of the American continent. In the northern hemisphere the\r\npredominance of land and its frequent alternations with water, the\r\nprevalence of particular winds, irregularities of the surface, and the\r\ndifference in the temperature of the points of maximum cold, cause the\r\nisothermal lines to deviate more from the parallels of latitude. They\r\nmake two deep bends northward, one in the Northern Atlantic and another\r\nin the northeast of America, and at last they separate into two parts,\r\nand encircle the points of maximum cold.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dove has discovered that, in consequence of the excess of land\r\nin the northern hemisphere, and the difference in the effect produced by\r\nthe sun’s heat according as it falls on a solid or liquid surface, there\r\nis an annual variation in the aggregate mean temperature at the surface\r\nof the earth, whose maximum takes place during the sun’s northern\r\ndeclination, and its minimum during its southern.[130]\r\n\r\nPlaces having the same mean annual temperature, often differ materially\r\nin climate: in some, the winters are mild and the summers cool, whereas\r\nin others the extremes of heat and cold prevail: England is an example\r\nof the first; Quebec, St. Petersburg, and the Arctic regions, are\r\ninstances of the second. The solar heat penetrates more abundantly and\r\ndeeper into the sea than into the land; in winter it preserves a\r\nconsiderable portion of that which it receives in summer, and from its\r\nsaltness does not freeze so soon as fresh water; hence, the ocean is not\r\nliable to the same changes of temperature as the land, and by imparting\r\nits heat to the winds it diminishes the severity of the climate on the\r\ncoasts and in islands, which are never subject to such extremes of heat\r\nand cold as are experienced in the interior of continents. The\r\ndifference between the influence of sea and land is strikingly\r\nexemplified in the high latitudes of the two hemispheres. In consequence\r\nof the unbounded extent of the ocean in the south, the air is so mild\r\nand moist that a rich vegetation covers the ground, while in the\r\ncorresponding latitudes in the north the country is barren from the\r\nexcess of land towards the Polar Ocean, which renders the air dry and\r\ncold. A superabundance of land in the equatorial regions, on the\r\ncontrary, raises the temperature, while the sea tempers it.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dove has shown, from a comparison of observations, that\r\nnorthern and central Asia have what may be termed a true continental\r\nclimate, both in summer and in winter—that is to say, a hot summer and\r\ncold winter; that Europe has a true insular or sea climate in both\r\nseasons, the summers being cool and the winters mild; and that in North\r\nAmerica the climate is inclined to be continental in winter, and insular\r\nin summer. The extremes of temperature in the year are greater in\r\ncentral Asia than in North America, and greater in North America than in\r\nEurope, and that difference increases everywhere with the latitude. In\r\nGuiana, within the tropics, the difference between the hottest and\r\ncoldest months in the year is 2°·2 of Fahrenheit, in the temperate zone\r\nit is about 60°, and at Yakutsk in Siberia 114°·4. Even in places which\r\nhave the same latitude as in northern Asia, compared with others in\r\nEurope or North America, the diversity is very great. At Quebec the\r\nsummers are as warm as those in Paris, and grapes sometimes ripen in the\r\nopen air, yet the winters are as severe as those in St. Petersburg. In\r\nshort, lines drawn on a map through places having the same mean summer\r\nor winter temperature are neither parallel to one another, to the\r\nisothermal or geothermal lines, and they differ still more from the\r\nparallels of latitude.[131]\r\n\r\nObservations tend to prove that all the climates on the earth are\r\nstable, and that their vicissitudes are only oscillations of greater or\r\nless extent, which vanish in the mean annual temperature of a sufficient\r\nnumber of years. There may be a succession of cold summers and mild\r\nwinters, but in some other country the contrary takes place; the\r\ndistribution of heat may vary from a variety of circumstances, but the\r\nabsolute quantity gained and lost by the whole earth in the course of a\r\nyear is invariably the same.\r\n\r\nSince the air receives its warmth chiefly from the earth, its\r\ntemperature diminishes with the height so rapidly, that at a very small\r\nelevation the cold becomes excessive, as the perpetual snow on the\r\nmountain-tops clearly shows. The decrease of heat is at the rate of a\r\ndegree of Fahrenheit’s thermometer for every 334 feet.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere, being a heavy and elastic fluid, decreases in density\r\nupwards, according to a determinate law, so rapidly, that three-fourths\r\nof the whole air it contains are within four miles of the earth, and all\r\nthe phenomena perceptible to us—as clouds, rain, snow, and thunder—occur\r\nwithin that limit. The air even on the tops of mountains is so rare as\r\nto diminish the intensity of sound, to affect respiration, and to\r\noccasion a loss of muscular strength in man and animals.[132]\r\n\r\nSince the space in the top of the tube of a barometer is a vacuum, the\r\ncolumn of mercury is suspended in the tube by the pressure of the\r\natmosphere on the surface of the mercury in the cistern: hence, every\r\nvariation in the density or height of the atmosphere occasions a\r\ncorresponding rise or fall in the barometric column. The actual mean\r\npressure of the atmosphere at the level of the sea is 15 pounds on the\r\nsquare inch; hence, the pressure on the whole earth is enormous.\r\n\r\nThe decrease in the density of the air affords a very accurate method of\r\nfinding the height of mountains above the level of the sea, which would\r\nbe very simple, were it not for changes of temperature which alter the\r\ndensity and interfere with the regularity of the law of its decrease.\r\nBut as the heat of the air diminishes with the height above the earth at\r\nthe rate of one degree of Fahrenheit’s thermometer for every 334 feet,\r\ntables are constructed, by the aid of which heights may be determined\r\nwith great accuracy. In consequence of diminished pressure also, water\r\nboils at a lower temperature on mountain-tops than at the level of the\r\nsea, which affords another method of ascertaining heights.[133]\r\n\r\nBy the annual and diurnal revolutions of the earth, each column of air\r\nis alternately exposed to the heat and cold of summer and winter, of day\r\nand night, and also to variations in the attraction of the sun and moon,\r\nwhich disturb its equilibrium, and produce tides similar to those in the\r\nocean. Those produced by the moon ebb and flow twice during a lunation,\r\nand diurnal variations in the barometer, to a very small amount, are\r\nalso due to the moon’s attraction.[134] The annual undulations\r\noccasioned by the sun have their greatest altitudes at the equinoxes,\r\nand their least at the solstices, and the diurnal variations in the\r\nheight of the barometer, which accomplish their rise and fall twice in\r\n24 hours, are chiefly due to the effects of temperature on the dry air\r\nand moisture of the atmosphere, which, according to Mr. Dove’s\r\ndiscoveries, produce independent pressures upon the mercurial column.\r\n\r\nA quantity of vapour is continually raised by the heat of the sun from\r\nthe surface of the globe, which mixes in an invisible state with the dry\r\nair or gaseous part of the atmosphere. It is most abundant in the torrid\r\nzone, and, like the heat on which it depends, varies with the latitude,\r\nthe season of the year, the time of the day, the elevation above the\r\nsea, and also with the nature of the soil, the land, and the water.\r\nThere is no chemical combination between the aërial and aqueous\r\natmospheres, they are merely mixed; and the diurnal variations arise\r\nfrom the superposition of two distinct diurnal oscillations, each going\r\nthrough its complete period in 24 hours; one taking place in the aërial\r\natmosphere from the alternate heating and cooling of the air, which\r\nproduce a flux and reflux over the point of observation; the other\r\narising from the aqueous atmosphere, owing to the alternate production\r\nand destruction of vapour by the heat of the day and the cold of the\r\nnight. The diurnal variations of the vapour have their maximum at or\r\nnear the hottest hour of the day, and their minimum at or near the\r\ncoldest, which is exactly the converse of the diurnal variations of the\r\ndry air. On the whole, there are two maxima and two minima heights of\r\nthe barometer in the course of 24 hours from the combinations of these,\r\nbut in the interior of continents far from water, where the air is very\r\ndry, there ought to be one maximum and one minimum during that period,\r\naccording to this theory.\r\n\r\nBetween the tropics the barometer attains its greatest height at nine or\r\nhalf-past nine in the morning; it then sinks till four in the afternoon,\r\nafter which it again rises and attains a second maximum at ten or\r\nhalf-past ten in the evening; it then begins to fall till it reaches a\r\nsecond time its lowest point at four in the morning. The difference in\r\nthe height is 0·117 of an inch, which gradually decreases north and\r\nsouth. Baron Humboldt mentions that the diurnal variations of the\r\nbarometric pressure are so regular between the tropics, that the hour of\r\nthe day may be inferred from the height of the mercury to within fifteen\r\nor sixteen minutes, and that it is undisturbed by storm, tempest, rain,\r\nor earthquake, both on the coasts and at altitudes 13,000 feet above\r\nthem. The mean height of the barometer between the tropics at the level\r\nof the sea is 30 inches with very little fluctuation, but, owing to the\r\nascending currents of air from the heat of the earth, it is less under\r\nthe equator than in the temperate zones. It attains a maximum in western\r\nEurope between the parallels of 40° and 45°; in the North Atlantic the\r\nmaximum is about the 30th parallel, and in the southern part of that\r\nocean it is near the tropic of Capricorn; the amplitude of the\r\noscillations decreases from the tropics to about the 70th parallel,\r\nwhere the diurnal variations cease. They are affected by the seasons,\r\nbeing greatest in summer and least in winter. It appears, also, that the\r\nfluctuations are the reverse on mountain-tops from what they are on the\r\nplains, and probably at a certain height they would cease\r\naltogether.[135] It is a singular fact, discovered by our navigators,\r\nthat the mean height of the barometer is an inch lower throughout the\r\nAntarctic Ocean and at Cape Horn than it is at the Cape of Good Hope or\r\nValparaiso: that difference in the pressure of the atmosphere is\r\nprobably connected with the perpetual gales off the extremity of South\r\nAmerica. M. Erman observed a similar depression near the Sea of Okhotsk\r\nin eastern Siberia.\r\n\r\nBesides the small horary undulations, there are vast waves moving over\r\nthe oceans and continents in separate and independent systems, being\r\nconfined to local yet very extensive districts, probably occasioned by\r\nlong-continued rains or dry weather over wide tracts of country. By\r\nnumerous barometrical observations made simultaneously in both\r\nhemispheres, the courses of several have been traced, some of which take\r\n24, others 36 hours, to accomplish their rise and fall. One especially\r\nof these vast barometric waves, many hundreds of miles in breadth, has\r\nbeen traced over the greater part of Europe, and not its breadth only,\r\nbut also the direction of its front, and its velocity, have been clearly\r\nascertained. The course of another wave has been made out from the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, through many intermediate stations, to the observatory at\r\nToronto in Canada. Since every undulation has its perfect effect\r\nindependently of the others, each one is marked by a change in the\r\nbarometer, and this is beautifully illustrated by curved lines on paper,\r\nconstructed from a series of observations. The general form of the curve\r\nshows the course of the principal wave, while small undulations in its\r\noutline mark the maxima and minima of the minor oscillations. Although,\r\nlike all other waves, these in the atmosphere are but waving forms, in\r\nwhich there is no transfer of air, yet winds arise from them like\r\ntide-streams in the ocean, and Sir John Herschel is of opinion that the\r\ncrossing of two of these vast aërial waves, coming in different\r\ndirections, may generate, at the point of intersection, those tremendous\r\nrevolving storms, or hurricanes, which spread desolation far and wide.\r\n\r\nThe air expands and becomes lighter with heat, contracts and becomes\r\nheavier with cold, and, as there are 82 degrees of difference between\r\nthe equatorial and polar temperature, the light warm air at the equator\r\nis constantly ascending to the upper regions of the atmosphere, and\r\nflowing north and south to the poles, from whence the cold heavy air\r\nrushes along the surface of the earth to supply its place between the\r\ntropics, for the same tendency to restore equilibrium exists in air as\r\nin other fluids. These two superficial currents, which have no rotatory\r\nmotion when they leave the poles, are deflected from their meridional\r\npaths by friction from the continually increasing velocity of the\r\nearth’s rotation, as they come nearer and nearer to the tropics; and, as\r\nthey revolve slower than the corresponding parts of the earth at which\r\nthey arrive, the bodies on its surface strike against them with the\r\nexcess of their velocity, so that the wind appears, to a person who\r\nthinks himself at rest, to blow in a direction contrary to that of the\r\nearth’s rotation. For that reason the current from the north pole\r\nbecomes a north-east wind before arriving at the tropic of Cancer, and\r\nthat from the south pole becomes a south-east wind before it comes to\r\nthe tropic of Capricorn, their limit being the 28th parallel of latitude\r\non each side of the equator. In fact, the difference of temperature puts\r\nthe air in motion, and the direction of the resulting wind, at every\r\nplace, depends upon the difference between the rotatory motion of the\r\nwind and the rotatory motion of the earth—the whole theory of the winds\r\ndepends upon these circumstances.\r\n\r\nNear the equator the trade-winds, north and south of it, so completely\r\nneutralize each other, that far at sea a candle burns without flickering\r\n[_i. e._ when it is flat calm]. This zone of calms and light breezes,\r\nknown as the _Variables_, which has a breadth of about five degrees and\r\na half, is subject to heavy rains and violent thunder-storms. On account\r\nof the arrangement of land and water, it does not coincide with the\r\nequator, but its centre runs along the sixth parallel of north latitude;\r\nhowever, it changes in position and extent with the declination of the\r\nsun, but never crosses the line.\r\n\r\nThough the trade-winds extend to the 28th degree on each side of the\r\nequator, their limits vary considerably in different parts of the ocean,\r\nmoving two or three degrees to the north or south, according to the\r\nposition of the sun; and in the Atlantic the north-east trade-wind is\r\nless steady than the south-east.[136] These perennial winds are known by\r\nrecent observations to be less uniform in the Pacific than in the\r\nAtlantic; they only blow permanently over that portion between the\r\nGalapagos Archipelago, off the coast of America, and the Marquesas. In\r\nthe Indian Ocean the south-east trade-wind blows from a few degrees east\r\nof Madagascar to the coast of Australia, between 10° and 28° S. lat. The\r\ntrade-winds are only constant far from land, because continents and\r\nislands intercept them, and change their course. On that account the\r\nnumerous groups of islands westward from the Marquesas change the\r\ntrade-winds into the periodical monsoons, which are steady currents of\r\nair in the Arabian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, and China Sea, arising from\r\ndiminished atmospheric pressure at each tropic alternately, from the\r\nheat of the sun, thereby producing a regular alternation of north and\r\nsouth winds, which, combining with the rotation of the earth on its\r\naxis, become a north-east wind in the northern hemisphere, and a\r\nsouth-east in the southern. The former blows from April to October, the\r\nlatter from October to April; the change is accompanied by heavy rain\r\nand violent storms of thunder and lightning. The ascent of the warm air\r\nbetween the tropics occasions a depression of the barometer amounting to\r\nthe tenth of an inch, which is a measure of the force producing the\r\ntrade-winds. In both hemispheres there is a regular variation in the\r\nmean height of the barometer within the zone in which these great aërial\r\ncurrents flow; it is higher at their polar limits, and decreases with\r\nextreme uniformity towards their equatorial boundaries, the difference\r\nin both hemispheres being 0·25 of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe unequal temperature of the land and sea causes sea-breezes which\r\nblow towards the land during the day, and land-breezes which blow\r\nsea-ward in the night; they are not perceptible in the mornings and\r\nevenings, because the temperature of the land and water is then nearly\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nThe trade-winds and monsoons are permanent, depending on the apparent\r\nmotion of the sun; but it is evident from theory that there must be\r\npartial winds in all parts of the earth, occasioned by the local\r\ncircumstances that affect the temperature of the air. Consequently, the\r\natmosphere is divided into districts, both over the sea and land, in\r\nwhich the winds have nearly the same vicissitudes from year to year. The\r\nregularity is greatest towards the tropics, where the causes of\r\ndisturbance are fewer. In the higher latitudes it is more difficult to\r\ndiscover any regularity, on account of the greater proportion of land,\r\nthe difference in its radiating power, and the greater extremes of heat\r\nand cold. But even there a degree of uniformity prevails in the\r\nsuccession of the winds; for example, in all places where north and\r\nsouth winds blow alternately, a vane veers through every point of the\r\ncompass in the transition, and in some places the wind makes several of\r\nthese gyrations in the course of the year.[137] The south-westerly\r\nwinds, so prevalent in the Atlantic Ocean between the 30th and 60th\r\ndegrees of north latitude, are produced by the upper current being drawn\r\ndown to supply the superficial current which goes towards the equator,\r\nand, as it has a greater rotatory motion than the earth in these\r\nlatitudes, it produces a south-westerly wind. On this account the\r\naverage voyage from Liverpool to New York in a sailing vessel is 40\r\ndays, while it is only 23 days from New York to Liverpool. For the same\r\nreason the average direction of the wind in England, France, Germany,\r\nDenmark, Sweden, and North America, is some point between south and\r\nwest. North-westerly winds prevail in the corresponding latitudes of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere from the same cause. In fact, whenever the air has a\r\ngreater velocity of rotation than the surface of the earth, a wind more\r\nor less westerly is produced; and when it has less velocity of rotation\r\nthan the earth, a wind having an easterly tendency results. Thus, there\r\nis a perpetual change between the different masses of the atmosphere,\r\nthe warm air tempering the cold of the higher latitudes, and the cold\r\nair mitigating the heat of the lower; it will be shown afterwards that\r\nthe aërial currents are the bearers of principles on which the life of\r\nthe animal and vegetable world depends.\r\n\r\nHurricanes are those storms of wind in which the portion of the\r\natmosphere that forms them revolves in a horizontal circuit round a\r\nvertical or somewhat inclined axis of rotation, while the axis itself,\r\nand consequently the whole storm, is carried forwards along the surface\r\nof the globe, so that the direction in which the storm is advancing is\r\nquite different from the direction in which the rotatory current may be\r\nblowing at any point; the progressive motion may continue for days,\r\nwhile the wind accomplishes many gyrations through all the points of the\r\ncompass in the same time. In the Atlantic the principal region of\r\nhurricanes is to the east of the West Indian islands, and in the Pacific\r\nit lies east of the island of Madagascar; consequently the former is in\r\nthe northern hemisphere, the latter in the southern; but in every case\r\nthe storm moves in an elliptical or parabolic curve. The West Indian\r\nhurricanes generally have their origin eastward of the Lesser Antillas\r\nor Caribbean islands, and the vertex of their path near the tropic of\r\nCancer, or about the exterior limit of the north-east trade-wind. As the\r\nmotion of the storm before it reaches the tropic is in a straight line\r\nfrom S.E. to N.W., and after it has passed the tropic from S.W., to\r\nN.E., the bend of the curve is turned towards Florida and the Carolinas.\r\nIn the South Pacific Ocean the body of the storms moves in an exactly\r\nopposite direction. The hurricanes which originate south of the equator,\r\nand whose initial path is from N.E. to S.W., turn at the tropic of\r\nCapricorn, and then tend from N.W. to S.E., so that the bend of the\r\ncurve is turned towards Madagascar.\r\n\r\nThe extent and velocity of the Atlantic hurricanes are great; the most\r\nrapid move at the rate of 43 miles an hour, the slowest 16. The\r\nhurricane which took place on the 12th of August, 1830, was traced from\r\nthe eastward of the Caribbean islands to the banks of Newfoundland, a\r\ndistance of more than 3000 miles, which it passed over in six days.\r\nAlthough that of the 1st of September, 1821, was not so extensive, its\r\nvelocity was greater, as it moved at the rate of 30 miles an hour. Small\r\nstorms are generally more rapid than those of great magnitude. Sometimes\r\nthey appear to be stationary, sometimes they stop and again proceed on\r\ntheir course, like water-spouts. Hurricanes are occasionally\r\ncontemporaneous, and so near to one another as to travel in almost\r\nparallel tracks. This happened in the China seas in October, 1840, when\r\nthe two storms met at an angle of 47°, and it was supposed that the ship\r\nGolconda foundered in that spot with 300 people on board. A hurricane\r\nhas been split or divided by a mountain into two separate storms, each\r\nof which continued its new course, and the gyrations were made with\r\nincreased violence. This occurred in the gale of the 25th of December,\r\n1821, in the Mediterranean, when the Spanish mountains and the maritime\r\nAlps became new centres of motion.\r\n\r\nBy the friction of the earth the axis of the storm bends a little\r\nforward, and the whirling motion begins in the higher regions of the\r\natmosphere before it is felt on the earth: this causes a continual\r\nintermixture of the lower and warmer strata of air with those that are\r\nhigher and colder, producing torrents of rain, and sometimes violent\r\nelectric explosions.\r\n\r\nThe rotation as well as the course of the storm is in a different\r\ndirection in the two hemispheres, though always alike in the same. In\r\nthe northern hemisphere the gyration is contrary to the movement of the\r\nhands of a watch, that is to say, the wind revolves from east, through\r\nthe north, to west, south, and east again; while in the southern\r\nhemisphere the rotation about the axis of the storm is in the contrary\r\ndirection. Hurricanes happen south of the equator between December and\r\nApril; in the West Indies between June and October. Rotatory storms\r\nfrequently occur in the Indian Ocean, and the typhoons of the China seas\r\nare real hurricanes of great violence. Both conform to the laws of such\r\nwinds in the northern hemisphere. The Atlantic storms probably reach\r\nSpain, Portugal, and the coast of Ireland. Two circular storms have\r\npassed over Great Britain, and small ones often occur between the Chops\r\nof the Channel and Madeira.\r\n\r\nThe revolving motion accounts for the sudden and violent changes\r\nobserved during hurricanes. In consequence of the rotation of the air,\r\nthe wind blows in opposite directions on each side of the axis of the\r\nstorm, and the violence of the blast increases from the circumference\r\ntowards the centre of gyration, but in the centre itself the air is in\r\nrepose: hence, when the body of the storm passes over a place, the wind\r\nbegins to blow moderately, and increases to a hurricane as the centre of\r\nthe whirlwind approaches; then in a moment a dead and awful calm\r\nsucceeds, suddenly followed by a renewal of the storm in all its\r\nviolence, but now blowing in a direction diametrically opposite to what\r\nit had before: this happened in the island of St. Thomas on the 2d of\r\nAugust, 1837, where the hurricane increased in violence till half-past\r\nseven in the morning, when perfect stillness took place for 40 minutes,\r\nafter which the storm recommenced in a contrary direction. The breadth\r\nof a hurricane is greatly augmented when its path changes its direction\r\nin crossing the tropic. In the Atlantic, the vortex of one of these\r\ntempests has covered an area from 600 to 1000 miles in diameter. The\r\nbreadth of the lull in the centre varies from 5 to 30 miles: the height\r\nis from 1 to 5 miles at most; so that a person might see the strife of\r\nthe elements from the top of a mountain, such as Teneriffe or Mowna Roa,\r\nin a perfect calm, for the upper clouds are frequently seen to be at\r\nrest during the hideous turmoil in the lower regions.\r\n\r\nThe sudden fall of the mercury in the barometer in latitudes habitually\r\nvisited by hurricanes is a certain indication of a coming tempest. In\r\nconsequence of the centrifugal force of these rotatory storms, the air\r\nbecomes rarified, and, as the atmosphere is disturbed to some distance\r\nbeyond the actual circle of gyration or the limits of the storm, the\r\nbarometer often sinks some hours before its arrival: it continues\r\nsinking the first half of the hurricane, and again rises during the\r\npassage of the latter half, though it does not attain its greatest\r\nheight till the storm is over. The diminution of atmospheric pressure is\r\ngreater, and extends over a wider area, in the temperate zones than in\r\nthe torrid, on account of the sudden expansion of the circle of rotation\r\nwhere the gale crosses the tropic.\r\n\r\nAs the fall of the barometer gives warning of the approach of a\r\nhurricane, so the laws of the storm’s motion afford to the seaman\r\nknowledge to avoid it. In the northern temperate zone, if the gale\r\nbegins from the S.E. and veers by S. to W., the ship should steer to the\r\nS.E.; but if the gale begins from the N.E. and changes through N. to\r\nN.W., the vessel ought to go to the N.W. In the northern part of the\r\ntorrid zone, if the storm begin from the N.E. and veer through E. to\r\nS.E., the ship should steer to the N.E.; but if it begin from the N.W.\r\nand veer by W. to S.W., the ship should steer to the S.W., because she\r\nis on the south-western side of the storm. Since the laws of storms are\r\nreversed in the southern hemisphere, the rules for steering vessels are\r\nnecessarily reversed also.[138]\r\n\r\nA heavy swell or storm-wave is peculiarly characteristic of these\r\ntempests. In the centre of the hurricane the pressure of the atmosphere\r\nis so much diminished by rotation, that the mercury in the barometer\r\nfalls from one to two, and even two and a-half inches. On that account,\r\nthe pressure of the ocean beyond the range of the wind raises the water\r\nin the centre of the vortex about two feet above its usual level, and\r\nproportionally to the degree of diminished pressure over the whole area\r\nof the storm. This mass of water, or storm-wave, is driven bodily along\r\nwith, or before, the tempest, and rolls in upon the land like a huge\r\nwall of water. It is similar to the earthquake wave, and is by no means\r\nthe heaping up of the water after a long gale. Ships have been swept by\r\nit out of docks and rivers, and it has sometimes carried vessels over\r\nreefs and banks so as to land them high and dry; this happened to two\r\nships on the coast of the Eastern Andaman islands, in 1844. Coringa, on\r\nthe Coromandel coast, is particularly subject to inundations from that\r\ncause. In 1789, the town and 20,000 inhabitants were destroyed by a\r\nsuccession of these great waves during a hurricane, and as many perished\r\nthere in 1839.\r\n\r\nBesides storm-waves, storm-currents are raised, which revolve with the\r\nrotation of the wind, and are of the greatest force near the centre of\r\nthe vortex.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the sea by the pressure of the surrounding ocean, and the\r\nirresistible fury of the wind, makes a tremendous commotion in the\r\ncentre of the storm, where the sea rises, not in waves, but in pyramidal\r\nmasses: the noise during its passage resembles the deafening roar of the\r\nmost tremendous thunder; and in the typhoons in the China seas it is\r\nlike numberless voices raised to the utmost pitch of screaming. In\r\ngeneral, there is very little thunder and lightning; sometimes a vivid\r\nflash occurs during the passage of the centre, or at the beginning of\r\nthe storm; yet in Barbadoes the whole atmosphere has been enveloped in\r\nan electric cloud.\r\n\r\nA thick lurid appearance, with dense masses of cloud in the horizon,\r\nominous and terrible, are the harbingers of the coming tempest. The sun\r\nand clouds frequently assume a fiery redness, the whole sky takes a wild\r\nand threatening aspect, and the wind rises and falls with a moaning\r\nsound, like that heard in old houses on a winter’s night: it is akin to\r\nthe “calling of the sea,” a melancholy noise which, in a dead calm,\r\npresages a storm on some parts of the English coast.\r\n\r\nThose intensely violent gales, of short duration, called _arched\r\nsqualls_, because they rise from an arch of clouds on the horizon, are\r\nnot rotatory; they occur in the Straits of Malacca, attended by fierce\r\nthunder and lightning and a lurid phosphorescent gleam. The\r\nnorth-western gales in the Bay of Bengal, the tornadoes on the African\r\ncoast, and the pampéros of the Rio de la Plata, are of the same nature.\r\nOn an average, a strong gale moves at the rate of 40 miles an hour, a\r\nstorm at about 56, and hurricanes at 90.\r\n\r\nWhirlwinds are frequent in tropical countries, especially in deserts;\r\nsometimes several are seen at one time in the Arabian deserts, of all\r\nsizes, from a few feet to some hundred yards in diameter. They occur in\r\nall kinds of weather, by night as well as by day, and come without the\r\nsmallest notice, rooting up trees, overwhelming caravans, and throwing\r\ndown houses; and as they produce water-spouts when they reach the sea,\r\nthey dismantle and even sink ships. The water-spouts so frequently seen\r\non the ocean originate in adjacent strata of air of different\r\ntemperatures, running in opposite directions in the upper regions of the\r\natmosphere. They condense the vapour, and give it a whirling motion, so\r\nthat it descends tapering to the sea below, and causes the surface of\r\nthe water to ascend in a pointed spiral till it joins that from above,\r\nand then it looks like two inverted cones, being thinner in the middle\r\nthan either above or below. When a water-spout has a progressive motion,\r\nthe upper and under part must move in the same direction, and with equal\r\nvelocity, otherwise it breaks, which frequently happens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nEvaporation—Distribution of Vapour—Dew—Hoar-Frost—Fog—Region of Clouds—\r\n  Forms of Clouds—Rain—Distribution of Rain—Quantity—Number of rainy\r\n  Days in different Latitudes—Rainless Districts—Snow Crystals—Line of\r\n  perpetual Snow—Limit of Winter Snow on the Plains—Sleet—Hail—\r\n  Minuteness of the ultimate Particles of Matter—Their Densities and\r\n  Forms—Their Action on Light—Colour of Bodies—Colour of the Atmosphere—\r\n  Its Absorption and Reflection of Light—Mirage—Fog Images—Coronæ and\r\n  Halos—The Rainbow—Iris in Dewdrops—The Polarization of the Atmosphere—\r\n  Atmospheric Electricity—Its Variations—Electricity of Fogs and Rain—\r\n  Inductive Action of the Earth—Lightning—Thunder—Distribution of\r\n  Thunder-Storms—Back Stroke—St. Elmo’s Fire—Phosphorescence—Aurora—\r\n  Magnetism—Terrestrial Magnetism—The Dip—Magnetic Poles and Equator—\r\n  Magnetic Intensity—Dynamic Equator—Declination—Magnetic Meridian—Lines\r\n  of equal Variation—Horary Variations—Line of Alternate Horary\r\n  Phenomena—Magnetic Storms—Coincidence of the Lines of equal Magnetic\r\n  Intensity with Mountain Chains—Diamagnetism.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOISTURE is evaporated in an invisible form from every part of the land\r\nand water, and at all temperatures, even from snow. Mr. Darwin mentions\r\nthat the snow once entirely disappeared from the volcano of Aconcagua,\r\nin Chile, which is 23,300 feet high, from evaporation under a cloudless\r\nsky and an excessively dry air. The vapour rises and mixes with the\r\natmosphere; and as its pressure and density diminish with the height\r\nabove the surface of the earth, in consequence of gravitation, there is\r\nabsolutely less moisture in the higher than in the lower regions of the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nSeven-tenths of the atmosphere rests on the ocean; therefore the sea has\r\nthe greatest influence in modifying climates and supplying the air with\r\nmoisture. The evaporation is greatest between the tropics, from the\r\nexcess of heat and the preponderance of the ocean, and its average\r\nquantity decreases from thence to the poles. Over the open sea, in all\r\nlatitudes, the air is saturated with moisture; and in that over the\r\ncoasts the quantity is very great, but it diminishes from the coasts to\r\nthe interior of the continents. In the interior of the United States of\r\nNorth America, in the deserts of Asia, and in the interior of New\r\nHolland, the air is continually dry. There is scarcely any evaporation\r\nin the deserts of Africa, and the extreme heat, increased by the\r\nreverberation of the sand, opposes aqueous precipitations, so this land\r\nis doomed to perpetual sterility. The air over the steppes of Siberia is\r\nlikewise nearly deprived of moisture. The greatest degree of dryness on\r\nrecord is that observed by M. Erman between the valleys of the Irtish\r\nand Obi, after a continued south-west wind and a temperature of 74° 7ʹ\r\nof Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThroughout all the countries in the northern hemisphere where\r\nobservations have been made on the variations of atmospheric moisture,\r\nit appears that the air contains less vapour in January than in any\r\nother month of the year, yet at that time there is the greatest\r\ndampness; while in July the air is driest, and yet, on account of the\r\nheat, evaporation is the greatest: the reason is, that the heat in July\r\ndissolves the moisture and increases its elasticity or tension so much\r\nthat it becomes insensible, whereas the cold of winter condenses it and\r\nrenders it apparent.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of atmospheric moisture varies also with the hours of the\r\nday and night. In early morning the evaporation accumulates near the\r\nsurface of the ground from the resistance of the air above it, but as\r\nthe sun rises above the horizon the warm air descends and carries the\r\nvapour with it; so that the quantity near the ground is diminished till\r\nevening, when, on account of the lowness of the temperature, the\r\nascending currents cease, and the air becomes loaded with vapour, and\r\ndeposits its excess in the shape of dew or hoar-frost. For in the night\r\nthe earth radiates part of the heat it received during the day through\r\nthe atmosphere into space, and the temperature of the bodies on its\r\nsurface sinks below that of the air; and by abstracting part of the heat\r\nwhich holds the humidity of the air in solution a deposition takes\r\nplace. If the radiation be great, the dew is frozen and becomes\r\nhoar-frost, which is the ice of dew. Cloudy weather is unfavourable for\r\nthe formation of dew by preventing the free radiation of heat, and\r\nactual contact is necessary for its formation, as it is never suspended\r\nin the air like fog. Dew falls in calm serene nights, but not on all\r\nsubstances indifferently; it wets them in proportion to their power of\r\nradiation, leaving those dry that radiate feebly or not at all. Dew is\r\nmost abundant on coasts; in the interior of continents there is very\r\nlittle, except near lakes or rivers. When dew is congealed into\r\nhoar-frost it forms beautiful crystals, and the cold which produces it\r\nis very hurtful to vegetation, but a slight covering preserves plants\r\nfrom its effects.\r\n\r\nWhen the atmosphere is so saturated with the vapour of water that it is\r\nprecipitated in the air itself, a fog is the result, which consists of\r\nsmall globular particles of water. When dew is formed the earth is\r\ncolder than the air in contact with it; but the case is exactly the\r\ncontrary when fogs take place, the moist soil being warmer than the air.\r\nIn countries where the soil is moist and warm, and the air damp and\r\ncold, thick and frequent fogs arise, as in England, where the coasts are\r\nwashed by a sea of elevated temperature, and the excess of the heat of\r\nthe Gulf-stream above the cold moist air is the cause of the perpetual\r\nfogs in Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nSuperior to all these phenomena, and at a considerable height above the\r\nearth, the air is very dry, because, under ordinary circumstances, the\r\nvapour ascends in a highly elastic and invisible state till it reaches a\r\nstratum of air of lower temperature, and then it is condensed into\r\nclouds. The region of clouds is a zone at a height varying from one to\r\nfour miles above the surface of the earth, which is saturated with\r\nmoisture. From friction and other causes the currents of air in the\r\nlower parts of that zone run horizontally on each other; and as they\r\ngenerally differ in moisture, temperature, and velocity, the colder\r\ncondense the invisible vapour in the warmer, and make it apparent in the\r\nform of a cloud, which differs in no respect from a fog, except that one\r\nfloats high in the air, while the other rests on the ground.\r\n\r\nAt moderate heights clouds consist of vapour, but at great elevations,\r\nwhere the cold is severe, they are an assemblage of minute crystals of\r\nice. They assume three primary characters, from whence four subordinate\r\nforms are derived. The cirrus, or cat’s-tail of sailors, is the highest;\r\nit sometimes resembles a white brush, at other times it consists of\r\nhorizontal bands of slender silvery filaments. To these all Kämtz’s\r\nmeasurements assign a height of 19,500 feet, which is confirmed by their\r\nappearance being the same when seen from the tops of mountains or from\r\nthe plains; consequently, they must consist of minute particles of ice\r\nor flakes of snow floating in the higher regions of the zone of clouds.\r\nThe cirri for the most part arrange themselves in parallel bands which\r\nconverge to opposite points in the horizon by the effects of\r\nperspective, and as they travel in their longitudinal direction they\r\nappear to be stationary. In the middle and higher latitudes of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere they tend from south-west to north-east, and at the\r\nequator from south to north. It is supposed that their parallel form\r\narises from their being conductors between two foci of electricity, but,\r\nwhatever the cause of this arrangement may be, it is very extensive.\r\nAmong these clouds, which occasionally appear like fleecy cotton or\r\nwool, halos and parhelia are formed, which often precede a change of\r\nweather, announcing rain in summer, in winter frost and snow.\r\n\r\nCumuli, or summer-clouds, are rounded forms resting on a straight band\r\nin the horizon, and resemble mountains covered with snow. They are\r\nformed by ascending currents drawing the vapours into the higher regions\r\nof the atmosphere; sometimes they rise and cover the whole sky, and in\r\nthe evening they frequently become more numerous and of deeper tint,\r\npresaging storm or rain.\r\n\r\nThe stratus is the third of the primary characters of clouds: it is a\r\nhorizontal band, which forms at sunset and vanishes at sunrise. The\r\nsubordinate varieties of clouds are combinations of these three\r\nprincipal classes.[139] The winds, the great agents in all atmospheric\r\nchanges, carry the vapour to a distance, where it is often condensed on\r\nthe tops of mountains into clouds which seem to be stationary, but which\r\nin reality are only maintained by a constant condensation of fresh\r\nvapour, which is carried off, as soon as formed, by the wind, and\r\nbecomes invisible on entering warmer air.\r\n\r\nWhen two masses of air of different temperature meet, the colder, by\r\nabstracting the heat which holds the moisture in solution, causes the\r\nparticles to coalesce and form drops of water, which fall in the shape\r\nof rain by their gravitation. And when two strata of different\r\ntemperature moving rapidly in contrary directions come into contact, a\r\nheavy fall of rain takes place; and as the quantity of aqueous vapour is\r\nmost abundant in tropical regions, the drops are larger and the rain\r\nheavier than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSince heat is the cause of evaporation, rain is very unequally\r\ndistributed, and with it decreases from the equator to the poles. From\r\nthe island of Otaheite [Tahiti], in the Pacific, to Uleaborg, in\r\nFinland, the annual quantity of rain that falls decreases from 150\r\ninches to 13. It is, however, more abundant in the New World than in the\r\nOld; 115 inches fall annually in tropical America, while in the Old\r\nWorld the annual fall is only 76 inches; so also in the temperate zone\r\nof the United States the annual quantity is 37 inches, while in the Old\r\nContinent it is but 31-3/4 inches.\r\n\r\nBetween the tropics the rains follow the sun: when he is north of the\r\nequator the rains prevail in the northern tropic; and when he is south\r\nof that line, in the southern: hence, one half of the year is extremely\r\nwet and the other half extremely dry; the change taking place near the\r\nequinoxes. Nevertheless, in countries situate between the 5th and 10th\r\nparallels of latitude, north and south, there are two rainy seasons, and\r\ntwo dry; one occurs when the sun passes the zenith in his progress to\r\nthe nearest tropic, and the other at his return, but in the latter the\r\nrains are less violent and of shorter duration. Although the quantity of\r\nwater which falls between the tropics in a month is greater than that of\r\na whole year in Europe, yet the number of rainy days increases with the\r\nlatitude, so that there are fewest where the quantity is greatest.\r\nNeither does it fall continually during the rainy season between the\r\ntropics, for the sky is generally clear at sunrise, it becomes cloudy at\r\nten in the morning, at noon the rain begins to fall, and, after pouring\r\nfor four or five hours, the clouds vanish at sunset, and not a drop\r\nfalls in the night, so that a day of uninterrupted rain is very rare.\r\n\r\nAt sea, within the region of the trade-winds, it seldom rains, but in\r\nthe narrow zone between them known as the _Variables_, in both the great\r\noceans, it rains almost continually, attended by violent thunder and\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole region where the monsoons prevail, it is not the\r\nsun, directly, but the winds, that regulate the periodical rains. That\r\nregion extends from the eastern coasts of Africa and Madagascar across\r\nthe Indian Ocean to the northern districts of Australia, and from the\r\ntropic of Capricorn to the face of the Himalaya, the interior of China,\r\nand even to Corea, inclusive. In these countries the western coasts are\r\nwatered during the south-west monsoon, which prevails from April to\r\nOctober; and the eastern coasts are watered during the north-east\r\nmonsoon, which blows from October to April. For example, the south-west\r\nwind condenses the vapour on the summit of the Ghauts, and violent rains\r\nfall daily on the coast of Malabar, while on the Coromandel coast the\r\nsky is serene. Exactly the contrary takes place during the north-east\r\nmonsoon; it rains on the coast of Coromandel, while there is fair\r\nweather on the Malabar coast, and the table-land of the Deccan partakes\r\nof both. In the southern hemisphere the rainy season corresponds with\r\nthe south-west monsoon, and the dry with the south-eastern.\r\n\r\nBetween the tropics it rains rarely during the night, and for months\r\ntogether not a drop falls; while in the temperate zone it often rains in\r\nthe night, and rain falls at all seasons, though more abundantly in some\r\nthan in others. It seldom rains in summer throughout the north of\r\nAfrica, Madeira, the southern parts of Spain and Portugal, Sicily,\r\nsouthern Italy, all Greece, and the north-western part of Asia; but it\r\nfalls copiously during the other seasons, especially in winter;\r\nconsequently, that extensive region is called the province of winter\r\nrains.\r\n\r\nThe province of autumnal rains includes all Europe south of the\r\nCarpathians, western France, the delta of the Rhine, northern and\r\nwestern Scandinavia, and the British isles; throughout these countries\r\nmore rain falls in autumn than in the other three seasons.\r\n\r\nThe province of summer rains comprises the eastern parts of France, the\r\nNetherlands (with the exception of the delta of the Rhine), the north of\r\nSwitzerland, all Germany north of the Alps, the Carpathian mountains,\r\nDenmark, southern Scandinavia, all central Europe, and the countries\r\nbeyond the Ural Mountains to the interior of Siberia, where showers are\r\nvery rare in winter. In some places it rains almost perpetually, as in\r\nthe island of Sitka, on the north-eastern coast of North America, where\r\nthe year has sometimes passed with only 40 days of fair weather.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere, in Chile and the south-western part of\r\nAmerica, winter is the rainy season, while on the eastern side of the\r\nCordilleras the rains occur in summer. In Tierra del Fuego and the\r\nextreme point of the continent the two provinces meet, the periodical\r\nprecipitation disappears, and it snows and rains throughout the year in\r\ntorrents. At Cape Horn the quantity of rain which fell in 41 days\r\nmeasured nearly 154 inches. This excessive fall of rain occurs along the\r\nwhole western shores of Patagonia, from the Straits of Magellan to Cape\r\nTres Montes—a circumstance favoured by the high and rugged coasts, and\r\nthe incessant westerly winds, which carry the vapour exhaled from the\r\nocean to be precipitated here in the form of rain.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa and Australia resemble each other in their rainy seasons,\r\nwhich in both countries take place in the winter months.\r\n\r\nThe annual amount of rain at the equator is 95 inches, which falls in 78\r\nor 80 days, giving an average of 1·14 inch daily; while at St.\r\nPetersburg the annual amount is 17 inches, which falls in 169 days, the\r\naverage being little more than the tenth of an inch daily.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of rain decreases in ascending from the plains to\r\ntable-lands, especially if these be edged by mountains, because they\r\nprecipitate the vapour before it arrives at the high plains. On the\r\ncontrary, the quantity increases in ascending from plains to the tops or\r\nslopes of rugged mountains, on account of partial currents of air which\r\ncondense the moisture into clouds.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of rain decreases on receding from the coasts into the\r\ninterior of continents, because more vapour rises from the sea than from\r\nthe land. The vapour from the Gulf-stream produces a greater quantity of\r\nrain and fog in the southern counties of England and Ireland than that\r\nwhich falls in the other parts of the islands.\r\n\r\nThe number of rainy days depends upon the direction of the wind. In\r\nEurope, if the wind always blew from the north-east, it would never\r\nrain, because it blows over a great extent of continent; whereas it\r\nwould never cease raining were the wind always to blow from the\r\nsouth-west, because it would come loaded with vapour from the Atlantic.\r\nHence, the greatest quantity of rain falls on the west coasts of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, the coast of Scandinavia, the eastern Alps, and the\r\ncentre of Portugal; in the two last it depends partly on the height and\r\nserrated form of the mountains. In western Europe it rains on twice as\r\nmany days as in the eastern part; in Ireland there are three times as\r\nmany rainy days as in Italy or Spain. In fact, on the western side of\r\nIreland it rains on 208 days out of the 365. In England, France, and the\r\nnorth of Germany, there are from 152 to 155 rainy days in the year; the\r\nnumber decreases towards the interior of the continent, so that in\r\nSiberia it only rains on 60 days in the year.\r\n\r\nThere are enormous tracts of land on which rain never falls, and others\r\nwhere it rains at long intervals and in small quantities. The most\r\nextensive rainless district stretches from the borders of Morocco\r\neastward through the desert of Africa, the low coasts of Arabia, Persia,\r\nand the desert province of Meekran, in Beloochistan, occupying a space\r\nof 80 degrees of longitude and 17 of latitude. The desert of Gobi, on\r\nthe table-land of Tibet, and part of Mongolia, form another rainless\r\nprovince in the great continent; while, in the New World, the rainless\r\ndistricts are—the table-land of Mexico, part of Guatemala and\r\nCalifornia, and the western declivity of the Andes of Peru, towards the\r\nPacific; in all occupying a surface equal to 5,500,000 square miles. The\r\nwhole of the moisture is intercepted by the Andes of Peru; so that rain\r\nonly occurs on the coast once or twice in a century—to the great terror\r\nof the inhabitants when it does fall. [The absence of rain is here\r\ncompensated for by copious dews and mists, termed “llovisnas.”] South\r\nAfrica, and Australia beyond the tropics, suffer from droughts, which\r\nare periodical in Australia; they recur in the countries of the eastern\r\ncoasts in a period of 12 years, and continue 3 years. The Pampas of\r\nSouth America are also subject to droughts, though they do not appear to\r\nbe periodical, nor do they continue more than a season.[140]\r\n\r\nWhen the temperature of the air is near the freezing-point or below it,\r\nsnow falls instead of rain; but the colder the air the less moisture\r\ndoes it contain, consequently the less snow falls, which is the reason\r\nof the comparatively small quantity on the high plains of the Himalaya\r\nand Andes. Snow sometimes assumes the form of grains; but is generally\r\nin regular crystals of great beauty, varying in form according to the\r\ndegree of cold. Captain Scoresby, whose voyages in the Polar Seas\r\nafforded him constant opportunities of studying them, of which he so\r\ndiligently availed himself, mentions five principal kinds of snow\r\ncrystals, each of which had many varieties, in all amounting to 96. M.\r\nKämtz, however, is of opinion that there are several hundred.\r\n\r\nSnow never falls between the tropics except on the tops of very high\r\nmountains. The mean elevation of the line of perpetual snow above the\r\nlevel of the sea in these hot regions is about 15,207 feet, from whence\r\nit decreases on both sides, and at last grazes the surface of the earth\r\nat the arctic and antarctic circles, subject however to various\r\nflexures. In the Andes, near Quito, the lowest level has an elevation of\r\n15,795 feet, which is higher than the top of Mont Blanc; from thence it\r\nvaries very irregularly, both to the north and south. In 18° of N. lat.\r\nit descends to 14,772 feet on the mountains of Mexico, while on the\r\nsouth it rises to 18,000 feet in some parts of the western Cordillera of\r\nthe Bolivian Andes, owing to the extensive radiation from the subjacent\r\nplains and valleys. The line is at an altitude of 17,000 feet on the\r\nwestern Cordillera, whence it sinks to 13,800 feet at Copiapo, to 12,780\r\nnear Valparaiso; it is only 8300 in the southern end of the Chilian\r\nAndes, and 3390 in the Straits of Magellan. In lat. 31° N. the snow-line\r\nis at an elevation of 12,981 feet on the southern side of the Himalaya,\r\nand at 16,620 feet on the northern side, while Captain Gerard gives from\r\n18,000 to 19,000 as its altitude on the mountains in the middle of the\r\nplain of Tartary. On Mont Blanc the line is at the height of 8500 feet,\r\nso that mountain is snow-clad for 7000 feet below its summit. In the\r\nPyrenees it is 8184 feet, and at the island of Mageroe it is at 2160\r\nfeet above the Polar Ocean.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere, snow never falls on the low lands at the\r\nlevel of the sea north of the 48th parallel of latitude, on account of\r\nthe predominance of water, whereas in the northern hemisphere it falls\r\non the plains much nearer the equator, on account of the excess of land,\r\nbut its limit is a curved line, on account of the alternations of land\r\nand water. In the western part of the great continent, the southern\r\nlimit of the fall of snow on the low lands nearly coincides with the\r\n30th parallel of north latitude, so that it includes all Europe. In the\r\nAmerican continent it follows nearly the same line, extending through\r\nthe southern parts of the United States. In China, snow falls at the\r\nlevel of the sea as far south as Canton; on the north-western coast of\r\nAmerica, on the contrary, it does not fall at that level till about the\r\n48th degree of N. lat.—these are the two extremes. Although Europe lies\r\nwithin the region of snow, the quantity that falls is very different in\r\ndifferent places, increasing greatly from south to north. On an average,\r\nit snows only one day and a-half at Rome in the year, while at\r\nPetersburg there are 171 snowy days, but in that city the quantity of\r\nrain is to that of snow as 1000 to 384.\r\n\r\nSleet, which is formed of small particles of rounded hail, falls in\r\nsqually weather in spring and autumn. True hail, when large, is\r\npear-shaped, and consists of a nucleus of frozen snow coated with ice,\r\nand sometimes with alternate layers of snow and ice. Hailstones have\r\noften fallen as large as pigeons’ and even hens’ eggs. The masses and\r\nblocks of ice of great size, which have not unfrequently fallen, appear\r\nto have been formed of hailstones of large size frozen together. It\r\nappears to be formed in the high cold regions of the atmosphere, by the\r\nsudden condensation of vapour during the contention of opposing winds,\r\nand is intimately connected with electricity, since its fall is\r\ngenerally accompanied with thunder and lightning. Hail-showers are of\r\nshort duration, exceedingly partial, and extend over a country in long\r\nnarrow bands; one which took place on the 13th of July, 1788, began in\r\nthe morning in the south of France, and reached Holland in a few hours,\r\ndestroying a narrow line of country in its passage.\r\n\r\nLocal circumstances, no doubt, have a great influence on its formation;\r\nit occurs more frequently in countries at a little distance from\r\nmountains than in those close to them or farther off, and at all hours,\r\nbut most frequently at the hotter time of the day. In the interior of\r\nEurope one half of the hail-storms take place in summer. Hail is very\r\nrare on the tropical plains, and often altogether unknown, though it\r\nfrequently falls at heights of 1700 or 1800 feet above them. If the air\r\nis very cold throughout the greater part of the stratum through which\r\nhail falls, it is probably increased in size during its descent; and, on\r\nthe contrary, large drops of rain which precede a thunder-storm are\r\nsupposed to be hail melted in its passage through low warm air.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LIGHT.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing of the size of the ultimate particles of matter, except\r\nthat they must be inconceivably small, since organized beings possessing\r\nlife and exercising all its functions have been discovered so minute\r\nthat a million of them would occupy less space than a grain of sand.\r\n\r\nThe air is only visible when in mass; the smallest globule of steam\r\ntells no more of its atoms than the ocean; the minutest grain of sand\r\nmagnified appears like the fragment of a rock—no mechanical division can\r\narrive at the indivisible. Although the ultimate atoms are beyond the\r\npower of vision, chemical compounds show that the divisibility of matter\r\nhas a limit, and that the particles have different densities; moreover,\r\nthe cleavage of crystalline substances gives reason to believe that they\r\nhave different forms.[141] Thus, the reasoning power of man has come to\r\nthe aid of his imperfect sense of vision, so that what were before\r\nimaginary things are now real beings with definite weights, and uniting\r\nby fixed laws. Though nothing had been known of their size, their\r\neffects were evident in the perceptions of sweet and sour, salt and\r\nbitter, and in the endless varieties of aroma in the food we eat and the\r\nliquors we drink. Moreover, their different densities are evident, as\r\nthey arise by their buoyancy in the perfume of the rose, or sink by\r\ntheir weight in the heavy odour of mignonette. Every substance on earth\r\nis merely a temporary compound of the ultimate atoms, sooner or later to\r\nbe resolved into its pristine elements, which are again to be combined\r\nin other forms, and according to other laws; so that literally there is\r\nnothing new under the sun, for there is no evidence of new matter being\r\nadded to the earth, nor of that which exists being annihilated. Fire,\r\nwhich seems utterly to destroy, only resolves bodies into their\r\nelementary parts, to become what they were before, the support of animal\r\nor vegetable life, or to form new mineral compounds. It is to the action\r\nof these particles on the light of the sun that nature owes all its\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nWhen a sunbeam passes through a glass prism[142] an oblong image of the\r\nsun is formed, consisting of colours in the following order—red, orange,\r\nyellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Sir John Herschel discovered\r\nlavender rays beyond the violet, and dark red rays exterior to the red,\r\nwhich are not so easily brought into evidence as the rest.\r\n\r\nEven the most transparent substances absorb light; air, water, the\r\npurest crystal, stop some of the rays as they pass through them. A\r\nportion of the light is also reflected from the surface of all bodies;\r\nwere it otherwise, they would be invisible. We should be unconscious of\r\nthe presence and form of material substances beyond our reach except by\r\nthe reflected rays,—\r\n\r\n          “The mist of light from whence they take their form\r\n          Hides what they are.”\r\n\r\nAs the same light does not come to all eyes, each person sees his own\r\nrainbow, the same flower by different rays. White substances reflect all\r\nthe light, black substances absorb all but that which renders them\r\nvisible, while coloured bodies decompose the light, absorb some of the\r\ncolours, and reflect or transmit the rest. Thus, a violet absorbs all\r\nbut the violet rays, which it reflects; a red flower only reflects the\r\nred and absorbs the rest; a yellow substance absorbs all but the yellow.\r\nIn the same manner transparent substances, whether solid or fluid,\r\nabsorb some colours and transmit others: thus, an emerald absorbs all\r\nbut the green, a ruby all but the red; whereas a diamond does not\r\ndecompose the light, but transmits every ray alike. Very few, however,\r\nof the colours, whether transmitted or reflected, are pure, but the\r\nsubstance takes its hue from the colour that predominates.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere absorbs all the colours of the sun’s light except the\r\nblue, which is its true colour. In countries where the air is pure, the\r\nazure of the sky is deep; it is still more so at great elevations, where\r\nthe density of the air is less; and its colour is most beautiful as it\r\ngradually softens the outlines of the mountains into extreme distance,\r\nor blends the sea with the sky. The air reflects and scatters part of\r\nthe white solar beams, whence the brightness and cheerfulness of day;\r\nthat property, together with the refractive power of the aqueous vapour,\r\ngives the roseate hue to the early morning, and the gold and scarlet\r\ntints to the closing day. Were it not for the reflective power of the\r\nair, the sun and moon would be like sharply-defined balls of fire in the\r\nprofoundly black vault of the heavens, and dark night would instantly\r\nfollow sunset. When the sun is 18 degrees below the horizon, the air, at\r\nthe height of 30 miles, is still dense enough to reflect his rays, and\r\ndivide the day from the night by the solar shades of twilight.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the sun’s light is absorbed by the atmosphere:\r\nthe loss increases with the density and obliquity of incidence and the\r\ndensity of the air. It is diminished 1300 times by the thickness of the\r\nair in the horizon, which enables us to look at the sun when setting\r\nwithout being dazzled.\r\n\r\nMirage, or the delusive appearance of water, so frequent in deserts, is\r\nowing to the reflection of light between two strata of air of different\r\ndensities, occasioned by the radiation of heat from the arid soil. It is\r\nvery common on the extensive plains in Asia and Africa, and especially\r\nin Upper Egypt; villages on small eminences above the plain appear as if\r\nthey were built on islands in the middle of a lake when the dry sandy\r\nground is heated by the mid-day sun. Sometimes objects appear double,\r\nand occasionally several images appear above one another, some direct\r\nand some inverted; this is particularly the case in high latitudes,\r\nwhere the Icy Sea cools the stratum of air resting on it.[143]\r\n\r\nIn the polar regions, or on the tops of mountains, when the sun is in\r\nthe horizon the shadow of a person is sometimes thrown on an opposite\r\ncloud or mist, the head being surrounded by concentric coloured rings or\r\ncircles, the number varying from one to five; Captain Scoresby saw four\r\nof these rings, on one occasion, round the shadow of his head, as he\r\nstood between the sun and a thick low fog: the first ring consisted of\r\nconcentric bands of white, yellow, red, and purple; the second consisted\r\nof concentric bands of blue, green, yellow, red, and purple; the third\r\nof green, white, yellowish white, red, and purple; and in the fourth\r\nwere greenish white, deeper on the edges. These appearances, called\r\n_glories_, or fog-images, and the coronæ or small concentric coloured\r\ncircles which surround the sun or moon when partly obscured by thin\r\nwhite clouds, are owing to the refraction of the light in the aqueous\r\nparticles of the cloud or fog. The colours in the concentric bands of\r\nthe coronæ, however, differ from the foregoing; that nearest the sun is\r\nof deep blue, white, and red; the circle exterior to that consists of\r\npurple, blue, green, pale yellow, and red; but the series is very rarely\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nHalos, which surround the sun in large circles, or a complicated\r\ncombination of circles, are, on the contrary, supposed to be produced by\r\nthe light falling on minute crystals of ice suspended in the atmosphere;\r\nthey are particularly brilliant and frequent in high latitudes. It is\r\nscarcely possible to give an idea of these beautiful and singular\r\nobjects. Sometimes a large coloured circle surrounds the sun or passes\r\nthrough his centre, which is occasionally touched or cut by segments of\r\nothers. One seen at St. Petersburg on the 29th of June, 1790, consisted\r\nof four coloured circles of different sizes intersecting each other,\r\nwhich were either cut or touched by segments of eight others, and at the\r\npoints of intersection mock suns or parhelia appeared. The sky is very\r\nhazy on these occasions. Mock suns, without circles and halos, are by no\r\nmeans uncommon round both sun and moon, but seldom of that complicated\r\nkind. They are situate between the observer and the sun, whereas the\r\nrainbow is always in that part of the sky opposite the sun, because it\r\nis produced by refraction and reflection of the sun’s rays in the drops\r\nof rain; and when the light is intense and the rain abundant, there are\r\ntwo concentric bows, the prismatic colour of the innermost of which are\r\nthe most vivid, the violet being within and the red outside: sometimes\r\nthe inner edge exhibits a repetition of colours in fine fringes, in\r\nwhich red and green predominate. The colours are reversed in the\r\nexterior bow, the violet being outside and the red on the inner edge.\r\nBesides these two principal and most common bows, supernumerary rainbows\r\noccasionally appear within the interior bow, generally green and violet,\r\nthough there are sometimes more or less perfect repetitions of all the\r\ncolours. In squally weather a rainbow is sometimes seen on a blue sky\r\nwhen rain is falling, but it is generally on clouds; it is constantly\r\nseen when the sun shines on the fine drops of fountains and cascades. As\r\nthe light of the moon is feeble, lunar rainbows are rare, and, for the\r\nmost part, colourless. In the early morning, when the sun throws his\r\nslanting beams across the fields, a miniature bow, with all its vivid\r\ncolours, may be seen in each dewdrop as it hangs on the points of the\r\nbending grass.\r\n\r\nLight is said to be polarized when, after having been once refracted or\r\nreflected, it is rendered incapable of being again refracted or\r\nreflected at certain angles. For example, if a crystal of brown\r\ntourmaline be cut longitudinally into thin slices, and polished, the\r\nlight of a candle may be seen through a slice as if it were glass. But\r\nif one of these slices be held perpendicularly between the eye and the\r\ncandle, and a second slice be turned round between the eye and the other\r\nplate of tourmaline, the image of the candle will vanish and come into\r\nview at every quarter-revolution of the plate, varying through all\r\ndegrees of brightness down to total or almost total evanescence, and\r\nthen increasing again by the same degrees as it had decreased. Thus, the\r\nlight, in passing through the first plate of tourmaline, is said to be\r\npolarized because it has been rendered incapable of passing through the\r\nsecond piece of tourmaline in certain positions.\r\n\r\nA ray of light acquires the same property if it be reflected from a pane\r\nof plate-glass at an angle of 57 degrees; it is by that rendered\r\nincapable of being reflected by another pane of plate-glass in certain\r\ndefinite positions, for the image of the light vanishes and reappears\r\nalternately at every quarter-revolution of the second pane.\r\n\r\nIf a thin plate of mica be interposed when the image of the candle has\r\nvanished, the darkness will instantly disappear, and a succession of the\r\nmost gorgeous colours will come into view, varying with every\r\ninclination of the mica, from the richest reds to the most vivid greens,\r\nblues, and purples. The most splendid colours arranged in symmetrical\r\nforms are exhibited by thin plates of an infinite variety of substances\r\nbesides mica. They display some of the most beautiful objects in nature,\r\nand show differences otherwise inappreciable in the arrangement of the\r\nmolecules of crystalline bodies.[144]\r\n\r\nM. Arago discovered that the light of the sun is polarized by the\r\nreflection of the atmosphere, but not equally so on every part of the\r\nsky; the polarization is least in the vicinity of the sun, and greatest\r\nat 90° from him, for there his light is reflected at an angle of 45°,\r\nwhich is the polarizing angle for air.[145] There are three points in\r\nthe sky where the light is not polarized: one of these neutral points,\r\ndiscovered by M. Arago, is 18° 30ʹ above the point diametrically\r\nopposite to the sun when he is in the horizon; the second neutral point,\r\ndiscovered by M. Babinet, is 18° 30ʹ above the sun when he is rising or\r\nsetting; and the third, discovered by Sir David Brewster, is 15° or 16°\r\nbelow the sun. These points vary with the height of the sun, and the two\r\nlatter rise and coincide in his centre when he is in the zenith.[146]\r\n\r\nNow, the portion of polarized light sent to the eye from any part of a\r\nclear sky is in a plane passing through that point, the eye of the\r\nobserver, and the centre of the sun. If that point be the north pole of\r\nthe heavens, it is clear that, as the sun moves in his diurnal course,\r\nthe plane will move with him as an hour circle, and may be used as a\r\ndial to determine the hour of the day. Professor Wheatstone, by whom\r\nthat beautiful application of the polarization of the atmosphere has\r\nbeen made, has constructed a clock, of very simple form, which shows the\r\ntime of day with great accuracy, and which has many advantages over a\r\nsun-dial.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nElectricity pervades the earth, the air, and all substances, without\r\ngiving any visible sign of its existence when in a latent state, but,\r\nwhen elicited, it exhibits forces capable of producing the most sudden,\r\nviolent, and irresistible effects. It is roused from its dormant state\r\nby every disturbance in the chemical, mechanical, or calorific condition\r\nof matter, and then experience shows that bodies in one electric state\r\nrepel, and in another they attract each other. Probably their mutual\r\nattraction and repulsion arise from the redundancy and defect of\r\nelectricity; in the first case they are said to be positively, in the\r\nlatter negatively electric.[147] When they have different kinds of\r\nelectricity they attract each other, and, when not opposed, the\r\nelectricity coalesces with great rapidity, producing the flash,\r\nexplosion, and shock, and that with the more violence the greater the\r\ntension or pressure of the electricity on the surrounding air which\r\nresists its escape. Equilibrium is then restored, and the electricity\r\nremains latent till called forth by a new exciting cause. The electrical\r\nstate of substances is easily disturbed, for, without contact, positive\r\nelectricity tends to produce negative electricity in a body near it, and\r\n_vice versâ_: the latter is then said to be electric by induction.\r\n\r\nThe electricity of the atmosphere arises from evaporation, and the\r\nchemical changes that are in perpetual progress on the globe; no\r\nelectricity, however, is developed by the evaporation of pure water, but\r\nit arises abundantly from water containing matter susceptible of\r\nchemical action during the evaporation; consequently, the ocean is one\r\nof the greatest sources of atmospheric electricity; combustion is\r\nanother, and a large portion arises from vegetation. The air, when pure,\r\nis almost always positively electric; but as the chemical changes on the\r\nearth sometimes produce positive and sometimes negative electricity, it\r\nis subject to great local variations; a passing cloud or a puff of wind\r\nproduces a change, and a distant storm renders it negative for the time,\r\nbut the earth is always in a negative state. The quantity of electricity\r\nvaries with the hours of the day and the seasons; it is more powerful in\r\nthe day than in the night, in winter than in summer, and it diminishes\r\nfrom the equator to the poles. It thunders daily in many places, in\r\nothers never, as on the east coast of Peru and in the Arctic regions,\r\nexcept where there are violent volcanic explosions, which always\r\ngenerate electricity, as in Iceland. Wherever there are no trees or high\r\nobjects to conduct it to the ground, the quantity of positive\r\nelectricity increases with the height above the surface of the earth.\r\nViolent thunder-storms take place on the tops of the Andes and Himalaya\r\nmountains, at heights of 26,650 feet above the plains.\r\n\r\nElectricity becomes very strong when dew is deposited, and in some cases\r\nit is strongly developed in fogs. Mr. Cross found it so powerful on one\r\noccasion, that it was dangerous to approach the apparatus for measuring\r\nits intensity. A continued succession of explosions lasted nearly five\r\nhours, and the stream of fire between the receiving-ball and the\r\natmospheric conductor was too vivid to look at. M. Peltier has found\r\nthat the common fogs arising from the mere condensation of the moisture\r\nin the air are neutral, but that others, which are produced by\r\nexhalations from the earth, are sometimes positive, sometimes negative;\r\nthe subject, however, requires further investigation.\r\n\r\nThough in long-continued mild rains there are no traces of electricity,\r\nyet, when rain or snow falls from the higher regions of the atmosphere,\r\nit is more or less developed, sometimes positive, sometimes negative,\r\ndepending a good deal on the direction of the wind. The atmosphere being\r\npositively electric, negative rain is supposed to arise from the\r\nevaporation of the drops in passing through dry air; the vapour carries\r\noff the positive electricity and leaves the drop in a negative state—a\r\ncircumstance which seems to be confirmed by the electricity of cascades,\r\nnear which there always is more or less negative electricity; the\r\npositive flows into the earth, while the other remains united to the\r\ndrops of the cascade.\r\n\r\nThe inductive action of the earth upon the clouds, and of the different\r\nstrata of clouds on each other, produces great variations in their\r\nelectrical state. If rain falls from the lowermost of two strata of\r\npositively electrical clouds, the inductive action of the earth renders\r\nthe under surface positive and the upper negative, and the rain is\r\npositive. By-and-bye the under surface of the cloud and the earth become\r\nneutral; and after a time the lower cloud becomes charged with negative\r\nelectricity by the induction of the upper strata, and the rain is then\r\nnegatively electric. Clouds are very differently charged; grey clouds\r\nhave negative—red, white, and orange clouds positive electricity; and\r\nwhen clouds differently charged meet, an explosion takes place. When the\r\nsky is clear and the air calm and warm, a succession of small white\r\nfleecy clouds rising rapidly above the horizon, and flying swiftly in\r\nthe very high regions of the atmosphere, is a certain presage of a\r\nthunder-storm.\r\n\r\nElectricity of each kind is probably elicited by the friction of\r\ncurrents of air, or masses of clouds moving rapidly in different\r\ndirections, as in thunder-storms, when small white clouds are seen\r\nflying rapidly over the black mass; yet the quick and irregular motion\r\nof clouds in storms is probably owing to the strong electrical\r\nattraction and repulsion among themselves, though both may be concerned\r\nin these hostile encounters. When two clouds differently charged by the\r\nsudden condensation of vapour, and driven by contending winds, approach\r\nwithin a certain distance, the thickness of the coating of electricity\r\nincreases on the two adjacent sides, and, when the accumulation becomes\r\nso great as to overcome the coercive pressure of the atmosphere between\r\nthem, a discharge takes place which occasions a flash of lightning. The\r\nactual quantity of electricity in any part of a cloud is very small. The\r\nintensity of the flash depends upon the extent of surface occupied by\r\nthe electricity, which acquires its intensity by its instantaneous\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\nThe air, being a non-conductor, does not convey the electricity from the\r\nclouds to the earth, but it acquires from them an opposite electricity,\r\nand when the tension is very great the force of the electricity becomes\r\nirresistible, and an interchange takes place between the clouds and the\r\nearth, but the motion of the lightning is so rapid that it is difficult\r\nto ascertain when it goes from the clouds to the earth, or from the\r\nearth to the clouds, though there is no doubt it does both: explosions\r\nhave burst from the ground, and people have been killed by them.\r\n\r\nWhen the air is highly rarified by heat, its coercive power is\r\ndiminished, so that the electricity escapes from the clouds in the form\r\nof diffuse lambent sheets of lightning without thunder or rain,\r\nfrequently seen in warm summer evenings, sometimes even near the zenith,\r\nand quite different from that sheet-lightning at the horizon which is in\r\ngeneral only the reflection of the forked lightning of a distant storm.\r\nWhen the quantity of electricity developed by the sudden condensation of\r\nvapour is very great, the lightning is always forked; its zigzag form is\r\noccasioned by the unequal conducting power of the air, by which it is\r\nsometimes divided into several branches. The author once saw a flash\r\ndivide into four parallel streams—a very uncommon occurrence.\r\nOccasionally, in very great storms, the lightning sends off lateral\r\nbranches. It often appears as a globe of fire moving so slowly that it\r\nis visible for several seconds, while the flashes of forked lightning do\r\nnot last the millionth part of a second. Professor Wheatstone, who has\r\nmeasured the velocity of lightning by experiments of great ingenuity,\r\nfound that it far surpasses the velocity of light, and would encircle\r\nthe globe in the twinkling of an eye. This inconceivable velocity is\r\nbeautifully exemplified in the electric telegraph, by which the most\r\nviolent and terrific agent in nature is rendered obedient to man, and\r\nconveys his thoughts as rapidly as they are formed. The colour of\r\nlightning is generally a dazzling white or blue, though in highly\r\nrarified air it is rose-colour or violet.\r\n\r\nThe sudden compression of the air during the passage of lightning must\r\nconvert a great quantity of latent into sensible heat, for heat in a\r\nlatent or insensible state exists in all bodies independent of their\r\ntemperature. Heat is absorbed and becomes insensible to the thermometer\r\nwhen solids become liquids, and when liquids are changed to vapour; and\r\nit again becomes sensible when vapour is condensed, and when liquids\r\nbecome solid. When water freezes, all the heat that kept it liquid is\r\ngiven out; and when ice melts, it absorbs heat from everything near it.\r\nThe air is full of heat in a latent state, whatever its temperature may\r\nbe, but it can be squeezed out by sudden compression so as to kindle\r\ntinder. Every aërial wave, every sound, every word spoken must set free\r\nan infinitesimal quantity of heat; so everything that tends to rarify\r\nthe air must cause it to absorb a proportional quantity.\r\n\r\nThe rolling noise of thunder is probably owing to the difference between\r\nthe velocity of lightning and that of sound. Thunder may be regarded as\r\noriginating in every point of a flash of lightning at the same instant;\r\nand as sound takes a considerable time to travel, it will arrive first\r\nfrom the nearest point; and if the flash run in a direct line from a\r\nperson, the noise will come later and later from the remote points of\r\nits path, in a continued roar. Should the direction of the flash be\r\ninclined, the succession of sounds will be more rapid and intense; and\r\nif the lightning describe a circular course above a person, the sound\r\nwill arrive at the same instant from every point with a stunning\r\ncrash.[148]\r\n\r\nIn passing to the earth, lightning follows the best conductors—metals by\r\npreference, then damp substances—which is the reason why men and animals\r\nare so often struck. If it meets with a bad conductor, it shivers it to\r\npieces and scatters the fragments to a considerable distance. A powerful\r\nflash scatters gunpowder, while a feeble one ignites it; the hardest\r\ntrees are split and torn to shreds; when a tree is struck, the heat of\r\nthe flash converts the sap into steam, the expansive force of which\r\nshivers the tree. The surface of rocks is vitrified by it; and when it\r\nfalls on a sandy soil, its course underground is marked by vitrified\r\ntubes many feet long.\r\n\r\nThunder-storms occur daily within the region of the Variables, which is\r\nalso the region of storms: in countries under the influence of the\r\nmonsoons they are tremendous at the changes of these periodical winds;\r\nwhere the trade-winds prevail they are hardly known, though electrical\r\ndischarges are frequent at their limits. In Greece and Italy there are\r\nabout 40 thunder-storms annually, which occur in spring and autumn,\r\nwhile north of the Alps they chiefly take place in summer. There are\r\nabout 24 in the year on the coasts of the Atlantic and in Germany, but\r\nthey are much more frequent among mountains than on plains. In the\r\ninterior of the old continent they rarely occur in winter, and\r\nthree-fourths of the number happen in summer. They are of such rare\r\noccurrence in high latitudes, that in a residence of 6 years in\r\nGreenland Sir Charles Geiseke only heard it thunder once.\r\n\r\nSome storms arise from the contention of opposite currents in the air;\r\nothers are occasioned by currents of warm air ascending from the earth,\r\nwhich are suddenly condensed as they enter the upper regions of the\r\natmosphere, and, as this sometimes happens at the hottest hour of the\r\nday, these storms are periodical for many successive days, recurring\r\nalways at the same hour. Sometimes they extend over a great expanse of\r\ncountry, and the lightning darts from all points of the compass. A\r\nperson may be killed at the distance of 20 miles from the explosion by\r\nthe _back stroke_. If the two extremities of a highly-charged cloud dip\r\ntowards the earth, they will repel the electricity of the earth, if it\r\nbe of the same kind with their own, and will attract the other kind; and\r\nif a discharge should take place at one end of the cloud, the\r\nequilibrium will instantly be restored by a flash from that part of the\r\nearth which is under the other, sufficiently strong to destroy life, and\r\nit is the most dangerous, though never so strong as the direct stroke.\r\n\r\nWhen thunder-clouds are very low, there is frequently no lightning; the\r\nelectricity produced by induction is so powerful that it escapes from\r\npointed objects in the shape of flame without heat, known as St. Elmo’s\r\nfire. These flames are not unfrequently seen at the topmasts of ships\r\nand the extremities of their yard-arms. Bodies between the clouds and\r\nearth may be electrized by induction, and their electricity will be seen\r\nin the form of flame, as showers of phosphorescent snow.\r\n\r\nPhosphorescence is ascribed to electricity; various substances emit\r\nlight when decaying, as fish and wood. Although many marine animals are\r\nphosphorescent, yet the luminous appearance which the sea often assumes\r\nis not always to be attributed to them, but probably to the decaying\r\nanimal matter it contains.\r\n\r\nThe aurora is decidedly an electrical phenomenon. It generally appears\r\nsoon after sunset in the form of a luminous arch stretching more or less\r\nfrom east to west, the most elevated point being always in the magnetic\r\nmeridian of the place of the observer: across the arch the coruscations\r\nare rapid, vivid, and of various colours, darting like lightning to the\r\nzenith, and at the same time flitting laterally with incessant velocity.\r\nThe brightness of the rays varies in an instant: they sometimes surpass\r\nthe splendour of stars of the first magnitude, and often exhibit colours\r\nof admirable transparency, blood-red at the base, emerald-green in the\r\nmiddle, and clear yellow towards their extremity. Sometimes one, and\r\nsometimes a quick succession of luminous currents run from one end of\r\nthe arch or bow to the other, so that the rays rapidly increase in\r\nbrightness; but it is impossible to say whether the coruscations\r\nthemselves are actually affected by a horizontal motion of translation,\r\nor whether the more vivid light is conveyed from ray to ray. The rays\r\noccasionally dart far past the zenith, vanish, suddenly reappear, and,\r\nbeing joined by others from the arch, form a magnificent corona or\r\nimmense dome of light. The segment of the sky below the arch is quite\r\nblack, as if formed by dense clouds; yet M. Struve is said to have seen\r\nstars in it, consequently the blackness must be from contrast. The lower\r\nedge of the arch is evenly defined; its upper margin is fringed by the\r\ncoruscations, their convergence towards the north, and that of the arch\r\nitself, being probably an effect of perspective.\r\n\r\nEither the aurora must be high above the earth, or its coruscations must\r\nbe very extensive, since the same display is visible at places wide\r\nasunder. It has frequently been seen in North America and all over the\r\nnorth of Europe at the same time, sometimes even as far south as Italy,\r\nyet Sir Edward Parry certainly saw a ray dart from it to the ground near\r\nhim. M. Struve, Admiral Wrangel, and others who have had many\r\nopportunities of seeing the aurora in high latitudes, assign a very\r\nmoderate elevation to it. The arch probably passes through the magnetic\r\npole; hence, in the north of Greenland it lies south of the observer,\r\nand Sir Edward Parry saw it to the south in Melville Island, which is in\r\n70° N. lat.; consequently it must appear in the zenith in some places.\r\nDr. Faraday conjectures that the electric equilibrium of the earth is\r\nrestored by the aurora conveying the electricity from the poles to the\r\nequator, for it appears in the high southern latitudes, as well as in\r\nthe northern; and the Rev. G. Fisher has lately suggested, that, as the\r\nprincipal display of the aurora takes place at or near the margin of the\r\npolar ice, the electricity may be conveyed by the conducting power of\r\nthe frozen particles which abound in the air in these latitudes, and\r\nwhich, being rendered fitfully luminous by the passage of the\r\nelectricity, produce the arch and the ever-varying flashes of the\r\naurora.\r\n\r\nThe aurora has a powerful influence on the magnetic needle, even in\r\nplaces where the display is not seen. Its vibrations seem to be slower\r\nor quicker according as the auroral light is quiescent or in motion, and\r\nthe disturbances of the magnetic needle and the auroral displays were\r\nsimultaneous at Toronto, in Canada, on 13 days out of 24, the remaining\r\ndays having been clouded; and contemporaneous observations show that on\r\nthese 13 days there were also magnetic disturbances at Prague and at Van\r\nDiemen’s Land, so that the “occurrence of aurora at Toronto on these\r\noccasions may be viewed as a local manifestation connected with magnetic\r\neffects, which, whatever may have been their origin, probably prevailed\r\non the same day over the whole surface of the globe.”[149]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nMagnetism is one of those unseen imponderable existences which, like\r\nelectricity and heat, are known only by their effects. It is certainly\r\nidentical with electricity, for, although it never comes naturally into\r\nevidence, magnets can be made to exhibit all the phenomena of electrical\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nTerrestrial magnetism, which pervades the whole earth, is extremely\r\ncomplicated; it varies both with regard to space and time, and,\r\nprobably, depends upon the heat of the sun, upon his motion in the\r\necliptic, which produces changes of temperature, on galvanic currents\r\ncirculating through the surface of the globe, and possibly on the\r\nearth’s rotatory motion.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of terrestrial magnetism is determined by the\r\ndeclination-needle, or mariner’s compass, and the dipping-needle; they\r\nconsist of magnetized needles or bars of steel, so suspended that the\r\ndeclination-needle revolves in a horizontal direction, and the\r\ndipping-needle moves in a plane perpendicular to the horizon. The north\r\nend of the declination-needle or magnet points to the north, and the\r\nsouth end to the south, and it only remains at rest when in that\r\nposition. The direction of the needle is the magnetic meridian of the\r\nplace of observation.\r\n\r\nThe north end of the dipping-needle bends or dips below the horizon in\r\nthe northern hemisphere, and the south end bends or dips beneath it in\r\nthe southern hemisphere, and between the two there is a line which\r\nencircles the whole earth, where the dipping-needle remains horizontal.\r\nThat line, which is the magnetic equator or line of no dip, crosses the\r\nterrestrial equator in several places, extending alternately on each\r\nside, but never deviating more than 12 degrees from it. The deviation is\r\ngreater in that part of the Pacific where there are most islands, and it\r\nis greatest both to the south and north in traversing the continents of\r\nAfrica and America; thus, it appears that the configuration of the land\r\nand water has an influence on terrestrial magnetism. North and south of\r\nthe magnetic equator the needle dips more and more, till at last it\r\nbecomes perpendicular to the horizon in two points, or rather linear\r\nspaces, known as the north and south magnetic poles, which are quite\r\ndistinct from the poles of the earth’s rotation. One, whose position was\r\ndetermined by Captain Ross, is in 70° N. lat. and 97° W. long., while\r\nthat in the southern hemisphere, determined by Sir James Ross, in the\r\ninterior of Victoria Island, is in 70° S. lat. and 162° E. long. Lines\r\nof equal dip are such as may be drawn on a globe through all those\r\nplaces where the dipping-needle makes the same angle with the horizon.\r\nThe angle of the dip is not always the same: according to Colonel\r\nSabine, who is the highest authority on this subject, it has been\r\ndecreasing in the northern hemisphere, for the last fifty years, at the\r\nrate of three minutes annually: it is also subject to variations of\r\nshort periods, and it seems to be affected by shocks of earthquakes,\r\neven when very distant.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the magnetic force is as variable and even more\r\ncomplicated than the other magnetic phenomena: it is measured by the\r\nnumber of vibrations made by the declination-needle in a given time. It\r\nis very different in different parts of the earth, but there are four\r\npoints in which the intensity is greater than anywhere else. Two of\r\nthese are in the northern and two in the southern hemisphere; they\r\nneither coincide with the poles of the earth’s rotation nor with the\r\nmagnetic poles, nor are they all of equal intensity.\r\n\r\nOne of these foci of maximum magnetic intensity is situate in North\r\nAmerica, south-west from Hudson’s Bay; another is in northern Siberia in\r\n120° E. long. In the southern hemisphere, one of the points of maximum\r\nmagnetic intensity is in the South Atlantic in 20° S. lat. and 324° E.\r\nlong., and the other is situate in 60° S. lat. and 131° 20ʹ E.\r\nlong.[150] In consequence of the unequal intensity of the force in these\r\n4 foci, the decrease in magnetic power from them towards the equator is\r\nextremely irregular, so that the dynamic equator, which is a line\r\nsupposed to be drawn through all the points on the earth where the\r\nintensity is the least, encircles the globe in a waving line, which\r\nneither coincides with the geographical nor magnetic equator; it forms\r\nthe division between the magnetic intensities in the two hemispheres.\r\nLines drawn on a globe through all the points where the magnetic\r\nintensity is the same are so complicated that it is scarcely possible to\r\nconvey an idea of them in words. They form a series of ovals round each\r\nof the foci of maximum force, then a figure of 8 in each hemisphere\r\nhaving a focus and its ovals in each loop, then they open into tortuous\r\nlines which encompass the globe, but which become less so as they\r\napproach the dynamic equator. The complication is increased by the foci\r\nin the two hemispheres being unsymmetrically placed with regard to one\r\nanother, as well as by the difference in their intensities.\r\n\r\nThe declination or horizontal needle only remains at rest when in a\r\nmagnetic meridian, that is, when it points to the north and south\r\nmagnetic poles. The magnetic meridians coincide with the geographical\r\nmeridians in some places, and in these the magnet points to the true\r\nnorth and south, that is, to the poles of the earth’s rotation. But if\r\nit be carried successively to different longitudes, it will deviate\r\nsometimes to the east, sometimes to the west of the true north.\r\nImaginary lines on the globe, passing through all places where the\r\nmagnet points to the poles of the earth’s rotation, are lines of no\r\nvariation; and lines passing through all places where the magnet\r\ndeviates by an equal quantity from the geographical meridians are lines\r\nof equal variation; they are also very irregular, and form two closed\r\nsystems or loops,—that is, they surround two points, one in northern\r\nSiberia and another in the Pacific, nearly in the meridian of the\r\nPitcairn Islands and the Marquesas.[151]\r\n\r\nThe whole magnetic system is perpetually undergoing secular and\r\nperiodical changes, which are so irregular and complicated that half a\r\ncentury is sufficient to alter the form and position of all the lines\r\nthat have been mentioned. The foci of magnetic intensity, and the whole\r\nsystem represented by the magnetic lines, are moving along the two\r\nhemispheres in opposite directions; those in the northern hemisphere are\r\ngoing from west to east, and those in the southern from east to west;\r\nand as the foci of maximum intensity move with different velocities, the\r\nforms, as well as the places, of the curves are slowly, yet continually,\r\nchanging. The weaker magnetic focus in the northern hemisphere moved\r\nthrough 50 degrees of longitude in 250 years.\r\n\r\nThe declination is subject to periodic variations depending upon the\r\nposition of the moon, and to annual variations arising from the motion\r\nof the sun in the ecliptic, as well as to horary variations\r\ncorresponding to changes of temperature from the diurnal rotation of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThroughout the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere the north end\r\nof the magnet has a mean motion from east to west from eight in the\r\nmorning till half-past one, it then moves to the east till evening,\r\nafter which it makes another excursion to the west, and returns again to\r\nits original position at eight in the morning. The extent of its\r\nvariation is greater in the day than in the night, in summer than in\r\nwinter. It decreases from the middle latitudes in Europe, where it is 13\r\nor 14 minutes, to the equator, where it is only 3 or 4; but at the\r\nequator the variations are performed with extreme regularity. The horary\r\nmotions of the south end of the magnet in the southern hemisphere are\r\naccomplished in an exactly opposite direction. Between these two\r\nmagnetic hemispheres there is a line passing through an infinity of\r\nplaces, and very nearly coinciding with the line of minimum magnetic\r\nintensity, where the horary phenomena of both hemispheres are combined,\r\neach predominating alternately at opposite seasons. At St. Helena, which\r\nis one of the places in question, and nearly on the line of minimum\r\nintensity, the horary motion of the north end of the magnet corresponds\r\nin direction during one half of the year with the movement in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, and in the other half of the year the direction at\r\nthe same hours corresponds with that in the southern hemisphere, the\r\npassage from the one to the other being at the equinoxes, when the\r\ndiurnal variations at the usual hours partake more or less of the\r\ncharacteristics of both on different days.[152]\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that there are six points on the earth peculiarly\r\nremarkable for magnetic phenomena, all of which are distinct from one\r\nanother, and from the poles of the earth’s rotation—namely, two magnetic\r\npoles where the dipping-needle makes an angle of 90 degrees with the\r\nhorizon. The magnetic equator corresponds with these in every point of\r\nwhich the angle of the dip is zero: it encircles the earth, and\r\nintersects the terrestrial equator, but does not coincide with it. The\r\nother four points are the foci of maximum magnetic intensity, and to\r\nthem the dynamical equator or line of minimum magnetic intensity\r\ncorresponds, also surrounding the earth in an irregular line, but which\r\ncoincides with neither the terrestrial nor magnetic equator. Besides\r\nthese, and either partly or nearly coinciding with the line of minimum\r\nintensity, is that line which is supposed to pass through all places\r\nwhere the horary variations of the magnet partake of the phenomena of\r\neach hemisphere alternately.\r\n\r\nThe earth’s magnetism is subject to vast unaccountable commotions or\r\nstorms of immense extent, which occur at irregular intervals, and are of\r\nshort duration. In 1818, a magnetic storm, shown by a violent agitation\r\nof the needle, took place at the same time over 47 degrees of longitude,\r\nextending through all the countries from Paris to Kasan; and on the 25th\r\nof September, 1841, one of these storms was simultaneously observed at\r\nToronto in North America, at the Cape of Good Hope, Prague in Europe, at\r\nMacao in China, and there is reason to believe that it extended to Van\r\nDiemen’s Land. Similar storms have happened simultaneously in Sicily and\r\nat Upsala in Sweden; others of less extent and shorter periods more\r\nfrequently occur, and are, like the greater storms, not to be attributed\r\nto any known cause.\r\n\r\nM. Necker de Saussure has traced a marked coincidence between the\r\nprevailing direction of the stratified masses of the mountain chains and\r\nthat of the curves of equal magnetic intensity. The coincidence is\r\nperfect in the Ural chain, for there the lines of force tend north and\r\nsouth; and they do not deviate much from the stratification in the great\r\nplains of European Russia. There is every reason to believe that a\r\ncoincidence takes place in the Scandinavian mountains, for a line of\r\nequal magnetic intensity passes parallel to the Norwegian coast. In\r\nScotland, a line almost coincides with the Grampians; and as it becomes\r\nless northerly before reaching Portugal and Spain, it is there also in\r\nsingular coincidence with the sierras on the table-land; the Pyrenees,\r\nhowever, form an exception to the law. A magnetic line follows the break\r\nof the chain of the Alps with great precision. The intersection of two\r\nupheavals makes these mountains alter their direction from S.W. and N.E.\r\nto E. nearly, and near to that change the magnetic line takes a similar\r\nbend, and coincides with the Caucasus, Taurus, Hindoo-Coosh, Himalaya,\r\nand Chinese mountains, after which it again tends to the north, and\r\nfollows the Yablonia chain to Behring’s Straits.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, the lines of equal magnetic force coincide with the Komri,\r\nand with the lofty sea-coast range which unites the mountains of\r\nAbyssinia with those at the Cape of Good Hope. Throughout North America\r\nthe lines of equal force coincide with the Alleghanies, and on the coast\r\nof the Pacific they take the direction of the Rocky Mountains. In\r\nMexico, the stratified rocks are parallel to the mountains of Anahuac,\r\nwhich is the same with the direction of the magnetic curves, and a\r\nsimilar coincidence takes place in the Parima ranges, and in the\r\ncoast-chain of Venezuela. The Andes, and the lines of equal magnetic\r\nintensity, are completely discordant, for they cross one another; but\r\nlines of equal magnetic force stretch from the southern promontories of\r\nAmerica and Asia to the mountains of Victoria Land.\r\n\r\nThere is strong presumptive evidence of the influence of the electric\r\nand magnetic currents on the formation and direction of the mountain\r\nmasses and mineral veins, but their slow persevering action on the\r\nultimate atoms of matter has been placed beyond doubt by the formation\r\nof rubies and other gems, as well as various other mineral substances,\r\nby voltaic electricity.\r\n\r\nThe existence of electric currents on the surface of the earth has been\r\ndeduced from terrestrial magnetism, and from the connection between the\r\ndiurnal variations of the magnet and the apparent motion of the sun;\r\nalso from the electro-magnetic properties of metalliferous veins, and\r\nfrom atmospheric electricity, which is continually passing between the\r\nair and the earth.\r\n\r\nDr. Faraday’s brilliant discoveries have changed the received opinions\r\nwith regard to the magnetic properties of matter. Although all bodies\r\nare magnetic, they show that it assumes a totally different form in\r\ndifferent substances. For example, if a bar of iron be freely suspended\r\nbetween the poles of an electro-magnet, or very powerful horse-shoe\r\nmagnet, it will be attracted by both poles, and will rest in the\r\ndirection between them—that is, on the line of force. But if a bar of\r\nbismuth be suspended in the same manner, it will be repelled by both\r\npoles, and will assume a direction at right angles to that which the\r\niron took, and thus the same force, whether electric or magnetic,\r\nproduces opposite effects upon these two metals. Substances affected\r\nafter the manner of iron are magnetic—those affected after the manner of\r\nbismuth are said to be _diamagnetic_. All substances come under one or\r\nother of these two classes: the diamagnetic are infinitely more abundant\r\nthan the magnetic; almost all bodies on earth belong to that class. Many\r\nof the metals, acids, oils, sugar, starch, animal matter, flame, and all\r\nthe gases, whether light or heavy, have the diamagnetic property less or\r\nmore, but oxygen less than any other, and that is the reason why\r\natmospheric air is the most feebly diamagnetic of all substances at its\r\nnatural temperature; for when very hot it becomes more diamagnetic, and\r\nif extremely cold it takes a place among the magnetic class. Important\r\nresults with regard to the magnetic state of the globe will undoubtedly\r\nbe deduced from this new property of matter, and Dr. Faraday’s\r\nobservations on that subject show that he is not without such\r\nanticipations.\r\n\r\n“When we consider the magnetic condition of the earth as a whole,\r\nwithout reference to its possible relation to the sun, and reflect upon\r\nthe enormous amount of diamagnetic matter which forms its crust; and\r\nwhen we remember that magnetic curves of a certain amount of force,\r\nuniversal in their presence, are passing through these matters, and\r\nkeeping them constantly in a state of tension, and therefore of action,\r\nwe cannot doubt that some great purpose, of utility to the system and to\r\nus its inhabitants, is fulfilled by it. If the sun have anything to do\r\nwith the magnetism of the globe, then it is possible that part of this\r\neffect may be due to the action of the light that comes to us from that\r\nbody; and in that view the air seems most strikingly placed round our\r\nsphere, investing it with a transparent diamagnetic, which, therefore,\r\nis permeable to his rays, and, at the same time, moving with great\r\nvelocity across them. Such conditions seem to suggest the possibility of\r\nmagnetism being thence generated.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nVegetation—Nourishment and Growth of Plants—Effects of the different\r\n  Rays of the Solar Spectrum—Classes—Botanical Districts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the present state of the globe, a third part only of its surface is\r\noccupied by land, and probably not more than a fourth part of that is\r\ninhabited by man, but animals and vegetables have a wider range. The\r\ngreater part of the land is clothed with vegetation and inhabited by\r\nquadrupeds, the air is peopled with birds and insects, and the sea teems\r\nwith living creatures and plants. These organized beings are not\r\nscattered promiscuously, but all classes of them have been originally\r\nplaced in regions suited to their respective wants. Many animals and\r\nplants are indigenous only in determinate spots, while a thousand others\r\nmight have supported them as well, and to many of which they have been\r\ntransported by man.\r\n\r\nPlants extract inorganic substances from the ground, which are\r\nindispensable to bring them to maturity, but the atmosphere supplies the\r\nvegetable creation with the principal part of its food.\r\n\r\nThe black or brown mould which is so abundant is the produce of decayed\r\nvegetables. When the autumnal leaves, the spoil of the summer, fall to\r\nthe ground, and their vitality is gone, they enter into combination with\r\nthe oxygen of the atmosphere, and convert it into an equal volume of\r\ncarbonic acid gas, which, consequently, exists abundantly in every good\r\nsoil, and is the most important part of the food of vegetables. This\r\nprocess is slow, and stops as soon as the air in the soil is exhausted;\r\nbut the plough, by loosening the earth, and permitting the atmosphere to\r\nenter more freely and penetrate deeper into the ground, accelerates the\r\ndecomposition of the vegetable matter, and consequently the formation of\r\ncarbonic acid.\r\n\r\nIn loosening and refining the mould, the common earth-worm is the\r\nfellow-labourer with man; it eats earth, and, after extracting the\r\nnutritious part, ejects the refuse, which is the finest soil, and may be\r\nseen lying in heaps at the mouth of its burrow. So instrumental is this\r\ncreature in preparing the ground, that it is said that there is not a\r\nparticle of the finer vegetable mould that has not passed through the\r\nintestines of a worm: thus, the most feeble of living things is employed\r\nby Providence to accomplish the most important ends.\r\n\r\nThe food of the vegetable creation consists of carbon, hydrogen,\r\nnitrogen, and oxygen—all of which plants obtain entirely from the\r\natmosphere in the form of carbonic acid gas, water, and ammonia. They\r\nimbibe these three substances, and, after having decomposed them, they\r\ngive the oxygen to the air, and consolidate the carbon, water, and\r\nnitrogen into wood, leaves, flowers, and fruit.\r\n\r\nThe vitality of plants is a chemical process entirely due to the sun’s\r\nlight; it is most active in clear sunshine, feeble in the shade, and\r\nnearly suspended in the night, when plants, like animals, have their\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere contains only one two-thousandth part of carbonic acid\r\ngas, yet that small quantity yields enough of carbon to form the solid\r\nmass of all the magnificent forests and herbs that clothe the face of\r\nthe earth, and the supply of that necessary ingredient in the\r\ncomposition of the atmosphere is maintained by the breath of animals, by\r\nvolcanos, and by combustion. The green parts of plants constantly imbibe\r\ncarbonic acid in the day; they decompose it, assimilate the carbon, and\r\nreturn the oxygen pure to the atmosphere. As the chemical action is\r\nfeeble in the shade and in gloomy weather, only a part of the carbonic\r\nacid is decomposed, then both oxygen and carbonic acid are given out by\r\nthe leaves; but during the darkness of the night a chemical action of a\r\ndifferent character takes place, and almost all the carbonic acid is\r\nreturned unchanged to the atmosphere, together with the moisture which\r\nis evaporated from the leaves both night and day. Thus, plants give out\r\npure oxygen during the day, and carbonic acid and water during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nSince the vivifying action of the sun brings about all these changes, a\r\nsuperabundance of oxygen is exhaled by the tropical vegetation in a\r\nclear unclouded sky, where the sun’s rays are most energetic, and\r\natmospheric moisture most abundant. In the middle and higher latitudes,\r\non the contrary, under a more feeble sun and a gloomy sky, subject to\r\nrain, snow, and frequent atmospheric changes, carbonic acid is given out\r\nin greater quantity by the less vigorous vegetation. But here, as with\r\nregard to heat and moisture, equilibrium is restored by the winds; the\r\ntropical currents carry the excess of oxygen along the upper strata of\r\nthe atmosphere to higher latitudes, to give breath and heat to men and\r\nanimals; while the polar currents, rushing along the ground, convey the\r\nsurplus carbonic acid to feed the tropical forests and jungles. Harmony\r\nexists between the animal and vegetable creations; animals consume the\r\noxygen of the atmosphere, which is restored by the exhalation of plants,\r\nwhile plants consume the carbonic acid exhaled by men and animals; the\r\nexistence of each is thus due to their reciprocal dependence. Few of the\r\ngreat cosmical phenomena have only one end to fulfil, they are the\r\nministers of the manifold designs of Providence.\r\n\r\nWhen a seed is thrown into the ground, the vital principal is developed\r\nby heat and moisture, and part of the substance of the seed is formed\r\ninto roots, which suck up water mixed with carbonic acid from the soil,\r\ndecompose it, and consolidate the carbon. In this stage of their growth,\r\nplants derive their whole sustenance from the ground. As soon, however,\r\nas the sugar and mucilage of the seed appear above the ground, in the\r\nform of leaves or shoots, they absorb and decompose the carbonic acid of\r\nthe atmosphere, retain the carbon for their food, give out the oxygen in\r\nthe day, and pure carbonic acid in the night. In proportion as plants\r\ngrow, they derive more of their food from the air and less from the\r\nsoil, till their fruit is ripened, and then the whole of their\r\nnourishment is derived from the atmosphere. Trees are fed from the air\r\nafter their fruit is ripe till their leaves fall; annuals till they die.\r\nAir-plants, and several species of cactus and others, derive all their\r\nfood from the atmosphere. It is wonderful that so small a quantity of\r\ncarbonic acid as exists in the air should suffice to supply the whole\r\nvegetation of the world—and still more wonderful that a seed, minute\r\nenough to be wafted invisibly by a breath of air, should be the theatre\r\nof all the chemical changes that make it germinate.[153]\r\n\r\nPlants absorb water from the ground by their roots; they decompose it,\r\nand the hydrogen combines in different proportions with their carbonic\r\nacid to form wood, sugar, starch, gum, vegetable, oils, and acids. As\r\nthe green parts combine with the oxygen of the air, especially during\r\nnight, when the functions of plants are torpid, it is assimilated on the\r\nreturn of daylight, and assists in forming oils, resins, and acids. The\r\ncombination of the oxygen of the air with the leaves, and also with the\r\nblossom and fruit, during night, is quite unconnected with the vital\r\nprocess, as it is the same in dead plants. An acid exists in the juice\r\nof every plant, generally in combination with an alkali. It must be\r\nobserved, however, that these different substances are produced at\r\ndifferent stages in the growth; for example, starch is formed in the\r\nroots, wood, stalk, and seed, but it is converted into sugar as the\r\nfruit ripens, and the more starch the sweeter the fruit becomes. Most of\r\nthese new compounds are formed between the flowering of the plant and\r\nthe ripening of the fruit, and indeed they furnish the materials for the\r\nflowers, fruit, and seed.\r\n\r\nAmmonia, the third organic constituent of plants, is the last residue\r\nfrom the decay and putrefaction of animal matter. It is volatilized, and\r\nrises into the atmosphere, where it exists as a gas, but in so small a\r\nquantity that it is with difficulty detected by chemical analysis; yet,\r\nas it is very soluble in water, enough is brought to the ground by rain\r\nto supply the vegetable world. Ammonia enters plants by their roots\r\nalong with rain-water, and is resolved within them into its constituent\r\nelements, hydrogen and nitrogen. The hydrogen aids in forming the wood,\r\nacids, and other substances before mentioned; while the nitrogen enters\r\ninto every part of the plant and forms new compounds; it exists in the\r\nblossom and fruit before it is ripe, and in the wood, as albumen; it\r\nalso forms gluten, which is the nutritious part of wheat, barley, oats,\r\nand all other cerealia, as well as of esculent roots, as potatoes,\r\nbeet-root, &c. Nitrogen exists abundantly in peas, beans, and pulse of\r\nevery kind; it enters into the composition of most elementary vegetable\r\nsubstances; in short, a plant may grow without ammonia, but it cannot\r\nproduce seed or fruit; the use of animal manure is to supply plants with\r\nthis essential article of their food. Thus, the decomposition and\r\nconsolidation of the elementary food of plants, the formation of the\r\ngreen parts, the exhalation of moisture by their leaves, its absorption\r\nby their roots, and all the other circumstances of vegetable life, are\r\nowing to the illuminating power of the sun. Heat can be supplied\r\nartificially in our northern climates, but it is impossible to replace\r\nthe splendour of a southern sun. His illuminating influence is displayed\r\nin a remarkable degree by the cacalia ficoides; its leaves combine with\r\nthe oxygen of the atmosphere during the night, and are as sour as sorrel\r\nin the morning; as the sun rises they gradually lose their oxygen, and\r\nare tasteless at noon; by the continued action of light they lose more\r\nand more, till towards evening they become bitter. The difference of a\r\nclear or cloudy sky has an immense effect on vegetation; the ripening of\r\nfruit depends upon the habitual serenity of the sky more than on summer\r\ntemperature alone.\r\n\r\nThe blue rays of the solar spectrum have most effect on the germination\r\nof seed; the yellow rays, which are the most luminous, on the growing\r\nplant. That is on account of the chemical rays, now so well known by\r\ntheir action in Daguerreotype impressions. They are most abundant beyond\r\nthe visible part of the solar spectrum, and diminish through the violet,\r\nblue, and green, to the yellow, where they cease. They penetrate the\r\nground, and have a much greater influence on the germination of seeds\r\nthan ordinary light or darkness. That invisible principle, together with\r\nlight, is essential to the formation of the colouring matter of leaves;\r\nit is most active in spring, and is in very considerable excess compared\r\nwith the quantity of light and heat; but as summer advances the reverse\r\ntakes place; the calorific radiation, or those hot rays corresponding to\r\nthe extreme red of the spectrum, which facilitate the flowering and\r\nforming of the fruit, become by far the most abundant; and a set of\r\ninvisible rays, which exist near the point of maximum heat in the solar\r\nspectrum, are also most abundant in summer. Mr. Hunt found that the hot\r\nrays immediately beyond the visible red destroy the colour of\r\npalm-leaves; and for that reason the glass of the palm-house at Kew\r\nGardens is tinged pale yellow-green by oxide of copper, which excludes\r\nthe scorching rays in question, though it is permeable by the other rays\r\nof heat, those of light, and the chemical rays.[154]\r\n\r\nIn spring and summer the oxygen taken in by the green leaves in the\r\nnight aids in the formation of oils, acids, and the other parts that\r\ncontain it; but as soon as autumn comes, the vitality or chemical action\r\nof vegetables is weakened; and the oxygen, no longer given out in the\r\nday, though still taken in during the night, becomes a minister of\r\ndestruction; it changes the colour of the leaves, and consumes them when\r\nthey fall. Nitrogen, so essential during the life of plants, also\r\nresumes its chemical character when they die, and by its escape hastens\r\ntheir decay.\r\n\r\nAlthough the food which constitutes the mass of plants is derived\r\nprincipally from water and the gases of the atmosphere, fixed substances\r\nare also requisite for their growth and perfection, and these they\r\nobtain from the earth by their roots. The inorganic matters are the\r\nalkalis, phosphates, silica, sulphur, iron, and others.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that vegetable acids are found in the\r\njuices of all the families of plants. They generally are in combination\r\nwith one or other of the alkaline substances, as lime, soda, potash, and\r\nmagnesia, which are as essential to the existence of plants as the\r\ncarbonic acid by which these acids are formed: for example, vines have\r\npotash; plants used as dyes never give vivid colours without it; all\r\nleguminous plants require it, and only grow naturally on ground that\r\ncontains it. None of the corn tribe can produce perfect seeds unless\r\nthey have both potash and phosphate of magnesia; nor can they or any of\r\nthe grasses thrive without silica, which gives the hard coating to\r\nstraw, to the beard of wheat and barley, to grass, canes, and bamboos;\r\nit is even found in solid lumps in the hollows and joints of cane, known\r\nin India by the name of tabashir. To bring the cerealia to perfection,\r\nit is indispensable that in their growth they should be supplied with\r\ncarbonic acid for the plant, silica to give it strength and firmness,\r\nand nitrogen for the grain.\r\n\r\nPhosphoric acid, combined with an earth or alkali, is found in the ashes\r\nof all vegetables, and is essential to many. Pulse contain but little of\r\nit, and on that account are less nutritious than the cerealia. The\r\nfamily of the cruciferæ, as cabbages, turnips, mustard, &c., contain\r\nsulphur in addition to the substances common to the growth of all\r\nplants; each particular tribe has its own peculiarities, and requires a\r\ncombination suited to it. On that account there is often a marked\r\ndifference in the arborescent vegetation on the same mountain, depending\r\non the nature of the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe ocean furnishes some of the matters found in plants; the prodigious\r\nquantity of sea-water constantly evaporated carries with it salt in a\r\nvolatilized state, which, dispersed over the land by the wind, supplies\r\nthe ground with salt and the other ingredients of sea-water. The\r\ninorganic matters which enter plants by their roots are carried by the\r\nsap to every part of the vegetable system. The roots imbibe all liquids\r\npresented to them indiscriminately, but they retain only the substances\r\nthey require at the various stages of their growth, and throw out such\r\nparts as are useless, together with the effete or dead matter remaining\r\nafter the nutriment has been extracted from it. Plants, like animals,\r\nmay be poisoned, but the power they have of expelling deleterious\r\nsubstances by their roots generally restores them to health. The\r\nfeculent matter injures the soil; besides, after a time the ground is\r\ndrained of the inorganic matter requisite for any one kind of plant:\r\nhence the necessity for a change or rotation of crops.\r\n\r\nA quantity of heat is set free and also becomes latent in the various\r\ntransmutations that take place in the interior of plants; so that they,\r\nlike the animal creation, have a tendency to a temperature of their own,\r\nindependent of external circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of electricity requisite to resolve a grain weight of water\r\ninto its elementary oxygen and hydrogen is equal to the quantity of\r\natmospheric electricity which is active in a very powerful\r\nthunder-storm; hence, some idea may be formed of the intense energy\r\nexerted by the vegetable creation in the decomposition of the vast mass\r\nof water and other matters necessary for its sustenance. But there must\r\nbe a compensation in the consolidation of the vegetable food, otherwise\r\na tremendous quantity would be in perpetual activity. It is said to be\r\ngiven out from the points of their leaves, so, possibly, some part of\r\nthe atmospheric electricity may be ascribed to this cause; but there is\r\nreason to believe that electricity, excited by the power of solar light,\r\nconstitutes the chemical vitality of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe colouring matter of flowers is various, if we may judge from the\r\neffect which the solar spectrum has upon their expressed juices. The\r\ncolour is very brilliant on the tops of mountains and in the Arctic\r\nlands. Possibly the diminished weight of the air may have some effect,\r\nfor it can scarcely be supposed that barometrical changes should be\r\nentirely without influence on vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe perfume of flowers and leaves is owing to a volatile oil, which is\r\noften carried by the air to a great distance: in hot climates it is most\r\npowerful in the morning and evening. The odour of the Humiria has been\r\nperceived at the distance of three miles from the coast of South\r\nAmerica, a species of Tetracera sends its perfume as far from the island\r\nof Cuba, and the aroma of the Spice Islands is wafted out to sea. The\r\nvariety of perfumes is infinite, and shows the innumerable combinations\r\nof which a few simple substances are capable, and the extreme minuteness\r\nof the particles of matter.\r\n\r\nIn northern and mean latitudes, winter is a time of complete rest to the\r\nvegetable world, and in tropical climates the vigour of vegetation is\r\nsuspended during the dry, hot season, to be resumed at the return of the\r\nperiodical rains. The periodical phenomena of the appearance of the\r\nfirst leaves, the flowering, ripening of the fruit, and the fall of the\r\nleaf, depend upon the annual and diurnal changes of temperature,\r\nmoisture, electricity, and perhaps on magnetism, and succeed with such\r\nperfect harmony and regularity, that, were there a sufficient number of\r\nobservations, lines might be drawn on a globe passing through all places\r\nwhere the leaves of certain plants appear simultaneously, and also for\r\nthe other principal phases of vegetation. In places where the same plant\r\nflowers on the same day, the fruit may not ripen at the same period in\r\nboth; it would therefore be interesting to know what relation lines\r\npassing through those would have to one another and to the isothermal\r\nlines; more especially with regard to the plants indispensable to man,\r\nsince the periodicity of vegetation affects his whole social\r\ncondition.[155]\r\n\r\nAlmost all plants sleep during the night; some show it in their leaves,\r\nothers in their blossom. The Mimosa tribe not only close their leaves at\r\nnight, but their foot-stalks droop; in a clover-field not a leaf opens\r\nuntil after sunrise. The common daisy is a familiar instance of a\r\nsleeping flower; it shuts up its blossom in the evening, and opens its\r\nwhite and crimson-tipped star, the “day’s eye,” to meet the early beams\r\nof the morning sun; and then also “winking mary-buds begin to ope their\r\ngolden eyes.” The crocus, tulip, convolvulus, and many others, close\r\ntheir blossoms at different hours towards evening, some to open them\r\nagain, others never. The ivy-leaved lettuce opens at eight in the\r\nmorning, and closes for ever at four in the afternoon. Some plants seem\r\nto be wide awake all night, and to give out their perfume then only, or\r\nat nightfall. Many of the jessamines are most fragrant during the\r\ntwilight: the Olea fragrans, the Daphne odorata, and the night-stock\r\nreserve their sweetness for the midnight hour, and the night-flowering\r\nCereus turns night into day. It begins to expand its magnificent\r\nsweet-scented blossom in the twilight, it is full blown at midnight, and\r\ncloses, never to open again, with the dawn of day;—these are “the bats\r\nand owls of the vegetable kingdom.”[156]\r\n\r\nMany plants brought from warm to temperate climates have become\r\nhabituated to their new situation, and flourish as if they were natives\r\nof the soil; such as have been accustomed to flower and rest at\r\nparticular seasons change their habits by degrees, and adapt themselves\r\nto the seasons of the country that has adopted them. It is much more\r\ndifficult to transfer alpine plants to the plains. Whether from a change\r\nof atmospheric pressure or mean temperature, all attempts to cultivate\r\nthem at a lower level generally fail: it is much easier to accustom a\r\nplant of the plains to a higher situation.\r\n\r\nPlants are propagated by seeds, offsets, cuttings, and buds; hence they,\r\nbut more especially trees, have myriads of seats of life, a congeries of\r\nvital systems acting in concert, but independently of each other, every\r\none of which might become a new plant. In this respect the fir and pine\r\ntribe are inferior to deciduous trees, which lose their leaves annually,\r\nbecause they are not easily propagated except by seeds. It has been\r\nremarked that all plants that are propagated by buds from a common\r\nparent stock have the same duration of life; this has been noticed\r\nparticularly with regard to some species of apple-trees in England. It\r\nappears that all the garden varieties of fruit, whether from buds,\r\nlayers, or cuttings, wear out after a time; and that seedlings have a\r\ngreat tendency to revert to the original wild character of the plant.\r\n\r\nA certain series of transitions takes place throughout the lives of\r\nplants, each part being transformed and passing into another; a law that\r\nwas first observed by the illustrious poet Göthe. For example, the\r\nembryo leaves pass into common leaves, these into bracteæ, the bracteæ\r\ninto sepals, the sepals into petals, which are transformed into stamens\r\nand anthers, and these again pass into ovaries with their styles and\r\nstigmas, that are to become the fruit and ultimately the seed of a new\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nPlants are naturally divided into three classes, differing materially in\r\norganization:—The Cryptogamia, whose flowers and seeds are either too\r\nminute to be easily visible, or are hidden in some part of the plant, as\r\nin fungi, mosses, ferns, and lichens, which are of the least perfect\r\norganization. Next to these are the monocotyledonous plants, as grasses\r\nand palms, in which the foot-stalks of the old leaves form the outside\r\nof the stem; plants of this class have but one-seed-lobe, which forms\r\none little leaf in their embryo state. Their flowers and fruit are\r\ngenerally referable to some law in which the number 3 prevails, as, for\r\nexample, the petals and other parts are three in number. The\r\ndicotyledonous plants form the third class, which is the most perfect in\r\nits organization, and by much the most numerous, including the trees of\r\nthe forest and most of the flowering shrubs and herbs. They increase by\r\ncoatings from without, as trees, where the growth of each year forms a\r\nconcentric circle of wood round the pith or centre of the stem: the\r\nseeds of these plants have two lobes, which in their embryo state appear\r\nfirst in two little leaves above ground, like most of the European\r\nspecies. The parts of the flowers and fruit of this class generally have\r\nsome relation to the number 5.\r\n\r\nThe three botanical classes are distributed in very different\r\nproportions in different zones: monocotyledonous plants, such as grasses\r\nand palms, are much more rare than the dicotyledonous class. Between the\r\ntropics there are four of the latter to one of the grass or palm tribes,\r\nin the temperate zones six to one, and in the polar regions only two to\r\none, because mosses and lichens are most abundant in the high latitudes,\r\nwhere dicotyledonous plants are comparatively rare. In the temperate\r\nzones one-sixth of the plants are annuals, omitting the cryptogamia; in\r\nthe torrid zone scarcely one plant in twenty is annual, and in the polar\r\nregions only one in thirty. The number of ligneous vegetables increases\r\non approaching the equator, yet in North America there are 120 different\r\nspecies of forest-trees, whereas in the same latitudes in Europe there\r\nare only 34. The social plants, grasses, heaths, furze, broom, daisies,\r\n&c., which cover large tracts, are rare between the tropics, except on\r\nthe mountains and table-lands and on the llanos of equatorial America.\r\n\r\nEquinoctial America has a more extensive and richer vegetation than any\r\nother part of the world; Europe has not above half the number of\r\nindigenous species of plants; Asia, with its islands, has somewhat less\r\nthan Europe; Australia, with its islands in the Pacific, still less; and\r\nthere are fewer vegetable productions in Africa than in any part of the\r\nglobe of the same extent.\r\n\r\nSince the constitution of the atmosphere is very much the same\r\neverywhere, vegetation depends principally on the sun’s light, moisture,\r\nand the mean annual temperature, and it is also in some degree regulated\r\nby the heat of summer in the temperate zones, and also by exposure, for\r\nsuch plants as require warmth are found at a lower level on the north\r\nthan on the south side of a mountain. Between the tropics, wherever rain\r\ndoes not fall, the soil is burnt up and is as unfruitful as that exposed\r\nto the utmost rigour of frost; but where moisture is combined with heat\r\nand light, the luxuriance of the vegetation is beyond description. The\r\nabundance and violence of the periodical rains combine with the intense\r\nlight and heat to render the tropical forests and jungles almost\r\nimpervious from the rankness of the vegetation. This exuberance\r\ngradually decreases with the distance from the equator; it also\r\ndiminishes progressively as the height above the level of the sea\r\nincreases, so that each height has a corresponding parallel of latitude\r\nwhere the climates and floras are similar, till the perpetual snow on\r\nthe mountain-tops, and its counterpart in the polar regions, have a\r\nvegetation that scarcely rises above the surface of the ground. Hence,\r\nin ascending the Himalaya or Andes from the luxuriant plains of the\r\nGanges or Amazons, changes take place in the vegetation analogous to\r\nwhat a traveller would meet with in a journey from the equator to the\r\npoles. This law of decrease, though perfectly regular over a wide\r\nextent, is perpetually interfered with by local climate and soil. From\r\nthe combination of various causes, as the distribution of land and\r\nwater, their different powers of absorption and radiation, together with\r\nthe form, texture, and clothing of the land, and the prevailing winds,\r\nit is found that the isothermal lines, or imaginary lines drawn through\r\nplaces on the surface of the globe which have the same mean annual\r\ntemperature, do not correspond with the parallels of latitude. Thus, in\r\nNorth America the climate is much colder than in the corresponding\r\nEuropean latitudes. Quebec is in the latitude of Paris, and the country\r\nis covered with deep snow four or five months in the year, and it has\r\noccurred that a summer has passed there in which not more than 60 days\r\nhave been free from frost.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere, beyond the 34th parallel, the summers are\r\ncolder and the winters milder than in corresponding latitudes of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere. Neither does the temperature of mountains vary\r\nexactly with their height above the sea; other causes, as prevailing\r\nwinds, difference of radiation, and geological structure, concur in\r\nproducing irregularities which have a powerful effect on the vegetable\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nHowever, no similarity of existing circumstances can account for whole\r\nfamilies of plants being confined to one particular country, or even to\r\na very limited district, which, as far as we can judge, might have grown\r\nequally well on many others. Latitude, elevation, soil, and climate, are\r\nbut secondary causes in the distribution of the vegetable kingdom, and\r\nare totally inadequate to explain why there are numerous distinct\r\nbotanical districts in the continents and islands, each of which has its\r\nown vegetation, whose limits are most decided when they are separated by\r\nthe ocean, mountain-chains, sandy deserts, salt-plains, or internal\r\nseas. Each of these districts is the focus of families and genera, some\r\nof which are found nowhere else, and some are common to others, but,\r\nwith a very few remarkable exceptions, the species of plants in each are\r\nentirely different or representative.[157] This does not depend upon the\r\ndifference in latitude, for the vegetation of the United States of North\r\nAmerica is totally unlike that of Europe under the same isothermal\r\nlines, and even between the tropics the greatest dissimilarity often\r\nprevails under different degrees of longitude: consequently, the cause\r\nof this partial distribution of plants, and that of animals also, which\r\nis according to the same law, must be looked for in those early\r\ngeological periods when the earth first began to be tenanted by the\r\npresent races of organized beings.\r\n\r\nAs the land rose at different periods above the ocean, each part, as it\r\nemerged from the waves, had probably been clothed with vegetation, and\r\npeopled with animals, suited to its position with regard to the equator,\r\nand to the climate and condition of the globe then being. And as the\r\nconditions and climate were different at each succeeding geological\r\nepoch, so each portion of the land, as it rose, would be characterized\r\nby its own vegetation and animals, and thus at last there would be many\r\ncentres of creation, as at this day, all differing more or less from one\r\nanother, and hence, alpine floras must be of older date than those in\r\nthe plains. The vegetation and faunas of those lands that differed most\r\nin age and place would be most dissimilar, while the plants and animals\r\nof such as were not far removed from one another in time and place would\r\nhave correlative forms or family likenesses, yet each would form a\r\ndistinct province. Thus, in opposite hemispheres, and everywhere at\r\ngreat distances, but under like circumstances, the species are\r\nrepresentatives of one another, rarely identical: when, however, the\r\nconditions which suit certain species are continuous, identical species\r\nare found throughout, either by original creation or by migration. The\r\nolder forms may have been modified to a certain extent by the succeeding\r\nconditions of the globe, but they never could have been changed, since\r\nimmutability of species is a primordial law of nature. Neither external\r\ncircumstances, time, nor human art, can change one species into another,\r\nthough each to a certain extent is capable of accommodating itself to a\r\nchange of external circumstances, so as to produce varieties even\r\ntransmissible to their offspring.\r\n\r\nThe flora of Cashmere and the higher parts of the Himalaya mountains is\r\nsimilar to that of southern Europe, yet the species are representative,\r\nnot identical. In the plains of Tartary, where from their elevation the\r\ndegree of cold is not less than in the wastes of Siberia, the vegetation\r\nof one might be mistaken for that of the other; the gooseberry, currant,\r\nwillow, rhubarb, and in some places the oak, hazel, cypress, poplar, and\r\nbirch, grow in both, but they are of different species. The flora near\r\nthe snow-line on the lofty mountains of Europe, and lower down, has also\r\na perfect family likeness to that in high northern latitudes. In like\r\nmanner many plants on the higher parts of the Chilian Andes are similar,\r\nand even identical, with those in Tierra del Fuego; nay, the Arctic\r\nflora has a certain resemblance to that of the Antarctic regions, and\r\neven occasional identity of species. These remarkable coincidences may\r\nbe accounted for by the different places having been at an early\r\ngeological period at the same level above the ocean, and that they\r\ncontinue to retain part of their original flora after their relative\r\npositions have been changed. The tops of the Chilian Andes were probably\r\non a level with Tierra del Fuego when both were covered with the same\r\nvegetation, and in the same manner the lofty plains of Tartary may have\r\nacquired their vegetation when they were on the level of southern\r\nSiberia.\r\n\r\nIn the many vicissitudes the surface of the globe has undergone,\r\ncontinents formed at one period were broken up at another into islands\r\nand detached masses by inroads of the sea and other causes. Now,\r\nProfessor E. Forbes has shown that some of the primary floras and faunas\r\nhave spread widely from their original centres over large portions of\r\nthe continents before the land was broken up into the form it now has,\r\nand thus accounts for the similarity and sometimes identity of the\r\nplants and animals of regions now separated by seas,—as, for example,\r\nislands, which generally partake of the vegetation and fauna of the\r\ncontinents adjacent to them. Taking for granted the original creation of\r\nspecific centres of plants and animals, Professor E. Forbes has clearly\r\nproved that “the specific identity, to any extent, of the flora and\r\nfauna of one area, with those of another, depends on both areas forming,\r\nor having formed, part of the same specific centre, or on their having\r\nderived their animal and vegetable population by transmission, through\r\nmigration, over continuous or closely contiguous land, aided, in the\r\ncase of alpine floras, by transportation on floating masses of ice.”\r\n\r\nBy the preceding laws the limited provinces and dispersion of animal and\r\nvegetable life are explained, but the existence of single species in\r\nregions very far apart has not yet been accounted for.\r\n\r\nVery few of the exogenous or dicotyledonous plants are common to two or\r\nmore countries far apart: among the few, the Samolus Valerandi, a common\r\nEnglish plant, is a native of Australia; the Potentilla tridentata, not\r\nfound in Britain, except on one hill in Angusshire, is common to Arctic\r\nEurope and the mountains of North America; and in the Falkland Islands\r\nthere are more than 30 flowering plants identical with those in Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThere are many more instances of wide diffusion among the\r\nmonocotyledonous plants, especially grasses: the Phleum alpinum of\r\nSwitzerland grows without the smallest variation at the Straits of\r\nMagellan, and Mr. Bunbury met with the European quaking-grass in the\r\ninterior of the country at the Cape of Good Hope; but the cellular or\r\ncryptogamous class is most widely diffused—plants not susceptible of\r\ncultivation, of little use to man, and of all others the most difficult\r\nto transport. The Sticta aurata, found in Cornwall, is a native of the\r\nCape of Good Hope, St. Helena, the West Indian islands, and Brazil; the\r\nTrichomanes brevisetum, long supposed to be peculiar to the British\r\nisles, is ascertained to grow in Madeira, South America, &c.; and our\r\neminent botanist, Mr. Brown, found 38 British lichens and 28 British\r\nmosses in New Holland, yet in no two parts of the world is the\r\nvegetation more dissimilar; and almost all the lichens brought from the\r\nsouthern hemisphere by Sir James Ross, amounting to 200 species, are\r\nalso inhabitants of the northern hemisphere, and mostly European.\r\n\r\nIn islands far from continents the number of plants is small, but of\r\nthese, a large proportion occur nowhere else. In St. Helena, of 30\r\nflower-bearing plants, 1 or 2 only are native elsewhere, but in 60\r\nspecies of cryptogamous plants Dr. Hooker found only 12 peculiar to the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nSome plants are more particularly confined to certain regions: the\r\nspecies of Cinchona which furnish the Peruvian bark grow along the\r\neastern declivity of the Andes, as far as 18° S. lat.; the cedar of\r\nLebanon is indigenous on that celebrated mountain only; and the Disa\r\ngrandiflora is limited to a very small spot on the top of the\r\nTable-mountain at the Cape of Good Hope; but whether these are remnants\r\nwhose kindred have perished by a change of physical circumstances, or\r\ncentres only beginning to spread, it is impossible to say.\r\n\r\nPlants are dispersed by currents: of 600 plants from the vicinity of the\r\nriver Zaire on the coast of Africa, 13 are found also on the shores of\r\nGuiana and Brazil, evidently carried by the great equatorial current to\r\ncountries congenial in soil and climate. The seeds of the Mimosa\r\nscandens, the Guilandina Bonduc, and the cashew-nut, are wafted from the\r\nWest India islands to the coasts of Scotland and Ireland by the\r\nGulf-stream, a climate and soil which do not suit them, therefore they\r\ndo not grow. Of all the great orders, the species of Leguminosæ are most\r\nwidely dispersed on coasts, because their seeds are not injured by the\r\nwater. Winds also waft seeds to great distances; birds and quadrupeds,\r\nand above all man, are active agents in dispersing plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nVegetation of the Great Continent—Of the Arctic Islands—And of the\r\n  Arctic and North Temperate Regions of Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE southern limit of the polar flora, on the great continent, lies\r\nmostly within the Arctic Circle, but stretches along the tops of the\r\nScandinavian mountains, and reappears in the high lands of Scotland,\r\nCumberland, and Ireland, on the summits of the Pyrenees, Alps, and other\r\nmountains in southern Europe, as well as on the table-land of eastern\r\nAsia, and on the high ridges of the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nThe great European plain to the Ural Mountains, as well as the low lands\r\nof England and Ireland, were at one period covered by a sea full of\r\nfloating ice and icebergs, which made the climate much colder than it\r\nnow is. At the beginning of that period the Scandinavian range, the\r\nother continental mountains, and those in Britain and Ireland, were\r\nislands of no great elevation, and were then clothed with the Arctic\r\nflora, or a representative of it, which they still retain now that they\r\nform the tops of the mountain-chains, and at that time both plants and\r\nanimals were conveyed from one country to another by the floating ice.\r\nIt is even probable, from the relations of the fauna and flora, that\r\nGreenland, Iceland, and the very high European latitudes, are the\r\nresidue of a great northern land which had sunk down at the close of the\r\nglacial period, for there were many vicissitudes of level during that\r\nepoch. At all events, it may be presumed that the elevation of the\r\nArctic regions of both continents, if not contemporaneous, was probably\r\nnot far removed in time. Similarity of circumstances had extended\r\nthroughout the whole Arctic regions, since there is a remarkable\r\nsimilarity and occasional identity of species of plants and animals in\r\nthe high latitudes of both continents, which is continued along the tops\r\nof their mountain-chains, even in the temperate zones; and there is\r\nreason to believe that the relations between the faunas and floras of\r\nBoreal America, Asia, and Europe, must have been established towards the\r\nclose of the glacial period.\r\n\r\nThe flora of Iceland approaches that of Britain, yet only one in four of\r\nthe British plants are known in Iceland. There are 870 species in\r\nIceland, of which more than half are flower-bearing: this is a greater\r\nproportion than is found in Scotland, but there are only 32 of woody\r\ntexture. This flora is scattered in groups according as the plants like\r\na dry, marshy, volcanic, or marine soil. Many grow close to the\r\nhot-springs: some not far from the edge of the basin of the Great\r\nGeyser, where every other plant is petrified; and species of Confervæ\r\nflourish in a spring said to be almost hot enough to boil an egg. The\r\ngrains cannot be cultivated on account of the severity of the climate,\r\nbut the Icelanders make bread from metur, a species of wild corn, and\r\nalso from the bulbous root of Polygonum viviparum; their greatest\r\ndelicacy is the Angelica archangelica; Iceland moss, used in medicine,\r\nis an article of commerce. There are 583 species in the Feroe islands,\r\nof which 270 are flowering plants: many thrive there that cannot bear\r\nthe cold of Iceland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 ARCTIC FLORA OF THE GREAT CONTINENTS.\r\n\r\nIn the most northern parts of the Arctic lands the year is divided into\r\none long intensely cold night and one bright and fervid day, which\r\nquickly brings to maturity the scanty vegetation. Within the limit of\r\nperpetual congelation the Palmella nivalis (or red snow of Arctic\r\nvoyagers), a very minute red or orange-coloured plant, finds nourishment\r\nin the snow itself, the first dawn of vegetable life; it is also found\r\ncolouring large patches of snow in the Alps and Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nLichens are the first vegetables that appear at the limits of the\r\nsnow-line, whether in high latitudes or mountain-tops, and they are the\r\nfirst vegetation that takes possession of volcanic lavas and new\r\nislands, where they prepare soil for plants of a higher order: they grow\r\non rocks, stones, and trees, in fact on anything that affords them\r\nmoisture. More than 2400 species are already known; no plants are more\r\nwidely diffused, and none afford a more striking instance of the\r\narbitrary location of species, as they are of so little direct use to\r\nman that they could not have been disseminated by his agency. The same\r\nkind prevail throughout the Arctic regions, and the species common to\r\nboth hemispheres are very numerous. Some lichens produce brilliant red,\r\norange, and brown dyes; and the tripe de roche, a species of Gyrophora,\r\nis a miserable substitute for food, as our intrepid countryman Sir John\r\nFranklin and his brave companions experienced in their perilous Arctic\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nMosses follow lichens on newly-formed soil, and they are found\r\neverywhere throughout the world in damp situations, but in greatest\r\nabundance in temperate climates: 800 species are known, of which a great\r\npart inhabit the Arctic regions, constituting a large portion of the\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nIn Asiatic Siberia, north of the 60th parallel of latitude, the ground\r\nis perpetually frozen at a very small depth below the surface: a\r\ntemperature of 70° below zero of Fahrenheit is not uncommon, and, in\r\nsome instances, the cold has been 120° below zero. Then it is fatal to\r\nanimal life, especially if accompanied by wind. In some places trees\r\ngrow and corn ripens even at 70° of north latitude; but in the most\r\nnorthern parts boundless swamps, varied by lakes both of salt and fresh\r\nwater, cover wide portions of this desolate country, which is buried\r\nunder snow nine or ten months in the year. As soon as the snow is melted\r\nby the returning sun, these extensive morasses are covered with coarse\r\ngrass and rushes, while mosses and lichens mixed with dwarf willows\r\nclothe the plains; saline plants abound, and whole districts produce\r\nDiotis ceratoides.\r\n\r\nIn Nova Zembla and other places in the far north, the vegetation is so\r\nstunted that it barely covers the ground, but a much greater variety of\r\nminute plants of considerable beauty are crowded together there in a\r\nsmall space than in the alpine regions of Europe where the same genera\r\ngrow. This arises from the weakness of the vegetation; for in the Swiss\r\nAlps the same plant frequently occupies a large space, excluding every\r\nother, as the dark-blue gentian, the violet-coloured pansy, the pink and\r\nyellow stone-crops. In the remote north, on the contrary, where vitality\r\nis comparatively feeble and the seeds do not ripen, thirty different\r\nspecies may be seen crowded together in a brilliant mass, no one having\r\nstrength to overcome the rest. In such frozen climates plants may be\r\nsaid to live between the air and the earth, for they scarcely rise above\r\nthe soil, and their roots creep along the surface, not having power to\r\nenter it. All the woody plants, as the Betula nana, the reticulated\r\nwillow, Andromeda tetragona, with a few berry-bearing shrubs, trail\r\nalong the ground, never rising more than an inch or two above it. The\r\nSalix lanata, the giant of these boreal forests, never grows more than\r\nfive inches above the surface, while its stem, 10 or 12 feet long, lies\r\nhidden among the moss, owing shelter to its lowly neighbour.\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristic of the vegetation of the Arctic regions is the\r\npredominance of perennial and cryptogamous plants, and also of the\r\nsameness of its nature; but more to the south, where night begins to\r\nalternate with day, a difference of species appears in longitude as well\r\nas in latitude. A beautiful flora of vivid colours adorns these\r\nlatitudes both in Europe and Asia during their brief but bright and\r\nardent summer, consisting of potentillas, gentians, chickweeds,\r\nsaxifrages, sedums, Ranunculi, spiræas, drabas, artemisias, claytonias,\r\nand many more. Such is the power of the sun, and the consequent rapidity\r\nof vegetation, that these plants spring up, blossom, ripen their seed,\r\nand die, in six weeks: in a lower latitude woody plants follow these, as\r\nberry-bearing shrubs, the glaucous Kalmia, the trailing Azalea and\r\nrhododendrons. The Siberian flora differs from that in the same European\r\nlatitudes by the North American genera Phlox, Mitella, Claytonia, and\r\nthe predominance of asters, Solidago, Spiræa, milk-vetches, wormwood,\r\nand the saline plants goosefoot and saltworts.\r\n\r\nSocial plants abound in many parts of the northern countries, as grass,\r\nheath, furze, and broom: the steppes are an example of this on a very\r\nextensive scale. Both in Europe and Asia they are subject to a rigorous\r\nwinter, with deep snow and chilling blasts of wind; and as the soil\r\ngenerally consists of a coating of vegetable mould over clay, no plants\r\nwith deep roots thrive upon them; hence, the steppes are destitute of\r\ntrees, and even bushes are rare except in ravines: the grass is thin,\r\nbut nourishing. Hyacinths and some other bulbs, mignonette, asparagus,\r\nliquorice, and wormwood, grow in the European steppes; the two last are\r\npeculiarly characteristic. The Nelumbium speciosum grows in one spot\r\nfive miles from the town of Astracan, and nowhere else in the wide\r\ndomains of Russia: the leaves of this beautiful aquatic plant are often\r\ntwo feet broad, and its rose-coloured blossoms are very fragrant. It is\r\nalso native in India and Tibet, where it is held sacred, as it was\r\nformerly in Egypt, where it is said to be extinct: it is one of the many\r\ninstances of a plant growing in countries far apart.\r\n\r\nEach steppe in Siberia has its own peculiar plants; the Peplis and\r\nCamphorosma are peculiar to the steppe of the Irtish, and the Amaryllis\r\ntatarica abounds in the meadows of eastern Siberia, where the vegetation\r\nbears a great analogy to that of north-western America: several genera\r\nand species are common to both.\r\n\r\nHalf the plants found by Wormskiold in Kamtchatka are European, with the\r\nexception of eight or ten, which are American. Few European trees grow\r\nin Asiatic Siberia, notwithstanding the similarity of climate, and most\r\nof them disappear towards the rivers Tobol and Irtish.\r\n\r\nIn Lapland and in the high latitudes of Russia, large tracts are covered\r\nwith birch-trees, but the pine and fir tribe are the principal\r\ninhabitants of the north. Prodigious forests of these are spread over\r\nthe mountains of Norway and Sweden, and in European Russia 200,000,000\r\nacres are clothed with these Coniferæ alone, or occasionally mixed with\r\nwillows, poplars, and alders. Although soils of pure sand and lime are\r\nabsolutely barren, yet they generally contain enough of alkali to supply\r\nthe wants of the fir and pine tribes, which require ten times less than\r\noaks and other deciduous trees.\r\n\r\nThe Siberian steppes are bounded on the south by great forests of pine,\r\nbirch, and willow: poplars, elms, and Tartarian maple overhang the upper\r\ncourses of the noble rivers which flow from the mountains to the Frozen\r\nOcean, and on the banks of the Yenessei the Pinus Cembra, or Siberian\r\npine, with edible fruit, grows 120 feet high. The Altaï are covered\r\nnearly to their summit with similar forests, but on their greatest\r\nheights the stunted larch crawls on the ground, and the flora is like\r\nthat of northern Siberia: round the lake Baikal the Pinus Cembra grows\r\nnearly to the snow-line.\r\n\r\nForests of black birch are peculiar to Dahuria, where there are also\r\napricot and apple trees, and rhododendrons, of which a species grows in\r\nthickets on the hills, with yellow blossoms. Here, and everywhere else\r\nthroughout this country, are found all the species of Caragana, a genus\r\nentirely Siberian. Each terrace of the mountains, and each steppe on the\r\nplains, has its peculiar plants, as well as some common to all:\r\nperennial plants are more numerous than annuals.\r\n\r\nIf temperature and climate depended upon latitude alone, all Asia\r\nbetween the 50th and 30th parallels would have a mild climate; but that\r\nis far from being the case, on account of the structure of the\r\ncontinent, which consists of the highest table-lands and the lowest\r\nplains on the globe.\r\n\r\nThe table-land of Tibet, where it is not cultivated, has the character\r\nof great sterility, and the climate is as unpropitious as the soil:\r\nfrost, snow, and sleet begin early in September, and continue with\r\nlittle interruption till May; snow, indeed, falls every month in the\r\nyear. The air is always dry, because in winter moisture falls in the\r\nform of snow, and in summer it is quickly evaporated by the intense heat\r\nof the sun. The thermometer sometimes rises to 144° of Fahrenheit in the\r\nsun, and even in winter his direct rays have great power for an hour or\r\ntwo, so that a variation of 100° in the temperature of the air has\r\noccurred in twelve hours. Notwithstanding these disadvantages, there are\r\nsheltered spots which produce most of the European grain and fruits,\r\nthough the natural vegetation bears the Siberian character, but the\r\nspecies are quite distinct. The most common indigenous plants are\r\nTartarian furze and various prickly shrubs resembling it, gooseberries,\r\ncurrants, hyssop, dog-rose, dwarf sow-thistle, Equisetum, rhubarb,\r\nlucern, and asafœtida, on which the flocks feed. Prangos, an\r\numbelliferous plant, with broad leaves and scented blossom, is peculiar\r\nto Ladak and other parts of Tibet. Mr. Moorcroft says it is so\r\nnutritious, that sheep fed on it become fat in twenty days. There are\r\nthree species of wheat, three of barley, and two of buckwheat, natives\r\nof the lofty table-land, where the sarsinh is the only fruit known to be\r\nindigenous. Owing to the rudeness of the climate trees are not numerous,\r\nyet on the lower declivities of some mountains there are aspens, birch,\r\nyew, ash, Tartaric oak, various pines, and the Pavia, a species of\r\nhorse-chestnut. Much of the table-land of Tartary is occupied by the\r\nGreat Gobi and other deserts of sand, with grassy steppes near the\r\nmountains; but of the flora of these regions we know nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n          FLORA OF BRITAIN AND OF MIDDLE AND SOUTHERN EUROPE.\r\n\r\nThe British islands afford an excellent illustration of distinct\r\nprovinces of animals and plants, and also of their migration from other\r\ncentres. Professor E. Forbes has determined five botanical districts,\r\nfour of which are restricted to limited provinces, whilst the fifth,\r\nwhich comprehends the great mass of British plants, is, everywhere,\r\neither alone or mixed with the others. All of these, with a very few\r\ndoubtful exceptions, have migrated before the British islands were\r\nseparated from the continent. The first, which is of great antiquity,\r\nincludes the flora of the mountain districts of the west and south-west\r\nof Ireland, and is similar to that in the south of Spain, but the more\r\ndelicate plants had been killed by the change of climate after the\r\nseparation of Ireland from the Asturias. The flora in the south of\r\nEngland and the south-east of Ireland is different from that in all\r\nother parts of the British islands; it is intimately related to the\r\nvegetation of the Channel Islands and the coast of France opposite to\r\nthem, yet there are many plants in the Channel Islands which are not\r\nindigenous in Britain. In the south-west of England, where the\r\nchalk-plants prevail, the flora is like that on the adjacent coast of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe tops of the Scottish mountains are the focus of a separate flora,\r\nwhich is the same with that in the Scandinavian Alps, and is very\r\nnumerous. Scotland, Wales, and a part of Ireland received this flora\r\nwhen they were groups of islands in the Glacial Sea. The rare Eriocaulon\r\nis found in the Hebrides, in Connemara, and in Northern America, and\r\nnowhere else. Some few individuals of this flora grow on the summits of\r\nthe mountains in Cumberland and Wales. The fifth, of more recent origin\r\nthan the alpine flora, including all the ordinary flowering plants, as\r\nthe common daisy and primrose, hairy ladies’ smock, upright meadow\r\ncrowfoot, and the lesser celandine, together with our common trees and\r\nshrubs, has migrated from Germany before England was separated from the\r\ncontinent of Europe by the British Channel. It can be distinctly traced\r\nin its progress across the island, but the migration was not completed\r\ntill after Ireland was separated from England by the Irish Channel, and\r\nthat is the reason why many of the ordinary English plants, animals, and\r\nreptiles, are not found in the sister island, for the migration of\r\nanimals was simultaneous with that of plants, and took place between the\r\nlast of the tertiary periods and the historical epoch, that of man’s\r\ncreation: it was extended also over a great part of the continent.[158]\r\n\r\nDeciduous trees are the chief characteristic of the temperate zone of\r\nthe old continent, more especially of middle Europe; these thrive best\r\nin soil produced by the decay of the primary and ancient volcanic rocks,\r\nwhich furnish abundance of alkali. Oaks, elms, beech, ash, larch, maple,\r\nlime, alder, and sycamore, all of which lose their leaves in winter, are\r\nthe prevailing vegetation, occasionally mixed with fir and pine.\r\n\r\nThe undergrowth consists of wild apple, cherry, yew, holly, hawthorn,\r\nbroom, furze, wild rose, honeysuckle, clematis, &c. The most numerous\r\nand characteristic herbaceous plants are the umbelliferous class, as\r\ncarrot and anise, the campanulas, the Cichoraceæ, a family to which\r\nlettuce, endive, dandelion, and sow-thistle belong. The cruciform tribe,\r\nas wallflower, stock, turnip, cabbage, cress, &c., are so numerous, that\r\nthey form a distinguishing feature in the botany of middle Europe, to\r\nwhich 45 species of them belong. This family is almost confined to the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, for, of 800 known species, only 100 belong to the\r\nsouthern, the soil of which must contain less sulphur, which is\r\nindispensable for these plants.\r\n\r\nIn the Pyrenees, Alps, and other high lands in Europe, the gradation of\r\nbotanical forms, from the summit to the foot of the mountains, is\r\nsimilar to that which takes place from the Arctic to the middle\r\nlatitudes of Europe. The analogy, however, is true only when viewed\r\ngenerally, for many local circumstances of climate and vegetation\r\ninterpose; and although the similarity of botanical forms is very great\r\nbetween certain zones of altitude and parallels of latitude, the species\r\nare, for the most part, different.\r\n\r\nEvergreen trees and shrubs become more frequent in the southern\r\ncountries of Europe, where about a fourth part of the ligneous\r\nvegetation never entirely lose their leaves. The flora consists chiefly\r\nof ilex, oak, cypress, hornbeam, sweet chestnut, laurel, laurustinus,\r\nthe apple tribe, manna or the flowering ash, carob, jujube, juniper,\r\nterebinths, lentiscus and pistaccio which yield resin and mastic,\r\narbutus, myrtle, jessamine (yellow and white), and various pines, as the\r\nPinus maritima, and Pinus Pinea, or stone pine, which forms so\r\npicturesque a feature in the landscape of southern Europe. The most\r\nprevalent herbaceous plants are Caryophylleæ, as pinks, Stellaria, and\r\narenarias, and also the labiate tripe, mint, thyme, rosemary, lavender,\r\nwith many others, all remarkable for their aromatic properties, and\r\ntheir love of dry situations. Many of the choicest plants and flowers\r\nwhich adorn the gardens and grounds in northern Europe are indigenous in\r\nthese warmer countries: the anemone, tulip, mignonette, narcissus,\r\ngladiolus, iris, asphodel, amaryllis, carnation, &c. In Spain, Portugal,\r\nSicily, and the other European shores of the Mediterranean, tropical\r\nfamilies begin to appear in the arums, plants yielding balsams,\r\noleander, date and palmetto palms, and grasses of the group of Panicum\r\nor millet, Cyperaceæ or sedges, Aloe and Cactus. In this zone of\r\ntransition there are six herbaceous for one woody plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        FLORA OF TEMPERATE ASIA.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of western Asia approaches nearly to that of India at one\r\nextremity, and Europe at the other; of 281 genera of plants which grow\r\nin Asia Minor and Persia, 109 are European. Syria and Asia Minor form a\r\nregion of transition, like the other countries on the Mediterranean,\r\nwhere the plants of the temperate and tropical zones are united. We owe\r\nmany of our best fruits and sweetest flowers to these regions. The\r\ncherry, almond, oleander, syringa, locust-tree, &c., come from Asia\r\nMinor; the walnut, peach, melon, cucumber, hyacinth, ranunculus, come\r\nfrom Persia; the date-palm, fig, olive, mulberry, and damask rose, come\r\nfrom Syria; the vine and apricot are Armenian, the latter grows also\r\neverywhere in middle and northern Asia. The tropical forms met with in\r\nmore sheltered places are the sugar-cane, date and palmetto palms,\r\nmimosas, acacias, Asclepias gigantea, and arborescent Apocineæ. On the\r\nmountains south of the Black Sea, American types appear in rhododendrons\r\nand the Azalea pontica, and herbaceous plants are numerous and brilliant\r\nin these countries.\r\n\r\nThe table-land of Persia, though not so high as that of eastern Asia,\r\nresembles it in the quality of the soil, which is chiefly clayey, sandy,\r\nor saline, and the climate is very dry; hence, vegetation is poor, and\r\nconsists of thorny bushes, acacias, mimosas, tamarisk, jujube, and\r\nasafœtida. Forests of oak cover the Lusistan mountains, but the\r\ndate-palm is the only produce of the parched shores of the Arabian Gulf\r\nand of the oases on the Persian table-land. In the valleys, which are\r\nbeautiful, there are clumps of Oriental plane and other trees, hawthorn,\r\ntree-roses, and many of the odoriferous shrubs of Arabia Felix.\r\n\r\nAfghanistan produces the seedless pomegranate, acacias, date-palms,\r\ntamarisks, &c. The vegetation has much the same general character as\r\nthat of Egypt. The valleys of the Hindoo Coosh are covered with clover,\r\nthyme, violets, and many odoriferous plants: the greater part of the\r\ntrees in the mountains are of European genera, though all the species of\r\nplants, both woody and herbaceous, are peculiar. The small leguminous\r\nplant, from whose leaves and twigs the true indigo dye is extracted,\r\ngrows spontaneously on the lower offsets of the Hindoo Coosh. This dye\r\nhas been in use in India from the earliest times, but the plant which\r\nproduces it was not known in England till towards the end of the 16th\r\ncentury. Since that time it has been cultivated in the West Indies and\r\ntropical America, though in that country there is a species indigenous.\r\n\r\nHot arid deserts bound India on the west, where the stunted and scorched\r\nvegetation consists of tamarisks, thorny acacia, deformed Euphorbiæ, and\r\nalmost leafless thorny trees, shaggy with long hair, by which they\r\nimbibe moisture and carbon from the atmosphere. Indian forms appear near\r\nDelhi, in the genera Flacourtia and others, mixed with Syrian plants.\r\nEast of this transition the vegetation becomes entirely Indian, except\r\non the higher parts of the mountains, where European types prevail.\r\n\r\nThe Himalaya mountains form a distinct botanical district. Immediately\r\nbelow the snow-line the flora is almost the same with that on the high\r\nplains of Tartary, to which may be added rhododendrons and andromedas,\r\nand among the herbaceous plants primroses appear. Lower down, vast\r\ntracts are covered with prostrate bamboos, and European forms become\r\nuniversal, though the species are Indian, as gentians, plantagos,\r\ncampanulas, and gale. There are extensive forests of Coniferæ,\r\nconsisting chiefly of Pinus excelsa, Deodora, and Morinda, with many\r\ndeciduous forest and fruit trees of European genera. A transition from\r\nthis flora to a tropical vegetation takes place between the altitudes of\r\n9000 and 5000 feet, because the rains of the monsoons begin to be felt\r\nin this region, which unites the plants of both. Here the scarlet and\r\nother rhododendrons grow luxuriantly; walnuts, and at least 25 species\r\nof oak, attain a great size, one of which, the Quercus semi-carpifolia,\r\nhas a clean trunk from 80 to 100 feet high. Geraniums and labiate plants\r\nare mixed in sheltered spots with the tropical genera of Scitamineæ, or\r\nthe ginger tribe; bignonias and balsams, and camellias, grow on the\r\nlower part of this region.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that Indian, European, American, and Chinese forms are\r\nunited in this zone of transition, though the distinctness of species\r\nstill obtains: the Triosteum, a genus of the honeysuckle tribe, is\r\nAmerican; the Abelia, another genus of the same, together with the\r\nCamellia and Tricyrtis, are peculiarly Chinese; the daisy and wild thyme\r\nare European. A few of the trees and plants mentioned descend below the\r\naltitude of 5000 feet, but they soon disappear on the hot declivities of\r\nthe mountain, where the Erythrina monosperma and Bombax heptaphyllum are\r\nthe most common trees, together with the Millingtoniæ, a tribe of large\r\ntimber-trees, met with everywhere between the Himalaya and 10° N. lat.\r\nThe Shorea robusta, Dalbergia, and Cedrela, a genus allied to mahogany,\r\nare the most common trees in the forests of the lower regions of these\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe temperate regions of eastern Asia, including Chinese Tartary, China,\r\nand Japan, have a vegetation totally different from that of any other\r\npart of the globe similarly situated, and show in a strong point of view\r\nthe distinct character which vegetation assumes in different longitudes.\r\nIn Mandshuria and the vast mountain-chains that slope from the eastern\r\nextremity of the high Tartarian table-land to the fertile plains in\r\nChina, the forests and flora are generally of European genera, but\r\nAsiatic species; in these countries the buckthorn and honeysuckle tribes\r\nare so numerous as to give a peculiar character to the vegetation. Mixed\r\nwith these and with roses are thickets of azaleas covered with blossoms\r\nof dazzling brightness and beauty.\r\n\r\nThe transition zone in this country lies between the 35th and 27th\r\nparallels of north latitude, in which the tropical flora is mixed with\r\nthat of the northern provinces. The prevailing plants on the Chinese low\r\ngrounds are Glycine, Hydrangea, the camphor laurel, Stillingia sebifera,\r\nor wax-tree, Clerodendron, Hibiscus Rosa-sinensis, Thuia orientalis,\r\nOlea fragrans, the sweet blossoms of which are mixed with the finer teas\r\nto give them flavour; Melia azedarach, or Indian pride, the paper\r\nmulberry, and others of the genus, and Camellia sasanqua, which covers\r\nhills in the province of Kiong-si. The tea-plant, and other species of\r\nCamellia, grow in many parts; the finest tea is the produce of a low\r\nrange of hills from between the 33d and 25th parallels, an offset from\r\nthe great chain of Peling. Thea viridis and bohea are possibly only\r\nvarieties of the same plant; the green tea is strong and hardy, the\r\nblack a small delicate plant. The quality of the tea depends upon the\r\nstage of growth at which it is gathered; early leaves make the best tea,\r\nthose picked late in the season give a very coarse tea. Bohea grows in\r\nthe province of Fu-kian, hyson in Song-lo. Pekoe or pak-ho, which means\r\nwhite down in Chinese, consists of the first downy sprouts or leaf-buds\r\nof three-years-old plants. A very costly tea of this kind, never brought\r\nto Europe, and known as the tea of the Wells of the Dragon, is used only\r\nby persons of the highest rank in China. The true Imperial tea, also,\r\ncalled Flos theæ, which is not, as was supposed, the flower-buds, but\r\nmerely a very superior quality of tea, seldom reaches Europe; that sold\r\nunder this name is really Chusan tea flavoured with blossoms of Olea\r\nfragrans.[159] The Chinese keep tea a year before they use it, because\r\nfresh tea has an intoxicating quality which produces disturbance of the\r\nnervous system like the effect of Erythroxylon Coca on the Peruvians. It\r\nis a remarkable circumstance that tea and coffee, belonging to different\r\nfamilies, natives of different quarters of the globe, should possess the\r\nsame principle, and it is not less remarkable that their application to\r\nthe same use should have been so early discovered by man.\r\n\r\nThe tea-plant grows naturally in Japan and upper Assam; it is hardy, and\r\npossesses great power of adaptation to climate. It has lately been\r\ncultivated in Brazil, in Provence, and in Algiers, but at an expense\r\nwhich renders it unprofitable. Tea comes to Europe almost exclusively\r\nfrom China, but the plant thrives so well in the north-western provinces\r\nof India that the English will ultimately compete with the Chinese in\r\nproducing it, especially for the consumption of Tibet. Tea was first\r\nbrought to Europe by the Dutch in 1610; a small quantity came to England\r\nin 1666, and now the annual consumption of tea in Great Britain is about\r\nfifty millions of pounds.[160]\r\n\r\nThe climate of Japan is milder than its latitude would indicate, owing\r\nto the influence of the surrounding ocean. European forms prevail in the\r\nhigh lands, as they do generally throughout the mountains of Asia and\r\nthe Indian Archipelago, with the difference of species, as Abies,\r\nCembra, Strobus, and Larix. The Japanese flora is similar to the\r\nChinese, and there are 30 American plants, besides others of Indian and\r\ntropical climates. These islands, nevertheless, have their own peculiar\r\nflora, distinct in its nature; as the Sophora, Kerria, Aucuba, Mespilus,\r\nand Pyrus Japonica, Rhus vernix, Illicium anisatum, or the anise-tree,\r\nDaphne odorata, the soap-tree, various species of the Calycanthus tribe,\r\nthe custard-apple, the Khair mimosa, which yields the catechu, the\r\nlitchi, the sweet orange, the Cycas revoluta, a plant resembling a dwarf\r\npalm, with various other fruits. Many tropical plants mingle with the\r\nvegetation of the cocoanut and fan palms.\r\n\r\nThus, the vegetation in Japan and China is widely different from that in\r\nthe countries bordering the Mediterranean, though between the same\r\nparallels of latitude. In the tropical regions of Asia, where heat and\r\nmoisture are excessive, the influence of latitude vanishes altogether,\r\nand the peculiarities of the vegetation in different longitudes become\r\nmore evident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nFlora of Tropical Asia—Of the Indian Archipelago, India, and Arabia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTROPICAL Asia is divided by nature into three distinct botanical\r\nregions: the Malayan peninsula, with the Indian Archipelago; India,\r\nsouth of the Himalaya, with the island of Ceylon; and the Arabian\r\npeninsula. The two first have strong points of resemblance, though their\r\nfloras are peculiar.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FLORA OF THE INDO-CHINESE PENINSULA AND THE INDIAN ARCHIPELAGO.\r\n\r\nMany of the vegetable productions of the peninsula beyond the Ganges are\r\nthe same with those of India, mixed with the plants of the Indian\r\nArchipelago, so that this country is a region of transition, though it\r\nhas a splendid vegetation of innumerable native productions, dyes of the\r\nmost vivid hues, spices, medicinal plants, and many with the sweetest\r\nperfume. The soil in many places yields three crops in the year; the\r\nfruits of India, and most of those of China, come to perfection in the\r\nlow lands. The arang forms an exception to the extreme beauty of the\r\nmultitude of palms which adorn the Malayan peninsula; though it is\r\neminently characteristic of that country, it is an ugly plant, covered\r\nwith black fibres like horsehair, sufficiently strong to make cordage.\r\nIt is cultivated for the sugar and wine made from its juice. Teak is\r\nplentiful; almost all that is used in Bengal comes from the Birman\r\nempire, though it is less durable than that of the Malabar coast. The\r\nHopea odorata is so large that a canoe is made of a single trunk; the\r\nGordonia integrifolia is held in such veneration that every Birman house\r\nhas a beam of it.\r\n\r\nThere are seven species of native oak in the forests; the Mimosa\r\ncatechu, which furnishes the terra japonica used in medicine; the trees\r\nwhich produce varnish and stick-lac; the Glyphyria nitida, a myrtle, the\r\nleaves of which are used as tea in Bencoolen, called by the natives the\r\ntree of long life. The coasts are wooded by the Heritiera robusta, a\r\nlarge tree which thrives within reach of the tide; bamboos with stems a\r\nfoot and a half in diameter grow in dense thickets in the low lands. The\r\nPalmyra palm and the Borassus flabelliformis grow in extensive groves in\r\nthe valley of the Irawaddy: it is a magnificent tree, often 100 feet\r\nhigh, remarkable for its gigantic leaves, one of which would shelter 12\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe anomalous trees the Zamias and Cycadeæ, somewhat like a palm with\r\nlarge pinnated leaves, but of a different family, are found here and in\r\ntropical India; those in America are of a different species. Orchideæ\r\nand tree-ferns are innumerable in the woody districts of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of the Indian Archipelago is gorgeous beyond description;\r\nalthough in many instances it bears a strong analogy to that of the\r\nMalayan peninsula, tropical India, and Ceylon, still it is in an eminent\r\ndegree peculiar. The height of the mountains causes variety in the\r\ntemperature sufficient to admit of the growth of dammar pines, oaks,\r\nrhododendrons, magnolias, valerians, honeysuckles, bilberries, gentians,\r\noleasters, and other European orders of woody and herbaceous plants; yet\r\nthere is not one species in common.\r\n\r\nPalm-trees are more abundant in these islands than in any other part of\r\nthe world, especially in the Sunda group, the origin of many, a few of\r\nwhich are now widely spread over the eastern countries. Three species of\r\nAreca, attaining a height of from 40 to 50 and more feet, are cultivated\r\nin all the hot parts of India; and Caryota Urens, the fruit of which is\r\nacrid, yet it yields wine and sugar, are all native. The attempt is vain\r\nto specify the multitudes of these graceful trees which form so\r\ncharacteristic a feature in the vegetation of these tropical islands,\r\nwhere a rich moist soil with intense heat brings them to such\r\nperfection. It has been observed that monocotyledonous plants are\r\ngenerally more plentiful in islands than on continents, and also that\r\nthey extend farther into the southern than into the northern hemisphere,\r\nwhich may be accounted for by the moist and mild climate of the former.\r\n\r\nJungle and dense pestilential woods entirely cover the smaller islands\r\nand the plains of the larger; the coasts are lined with thickets of\r\nmangroves, a matted vegetation of forest-trees, bamboos, and coarse\r\ngrass, entwined with climbing and creeping plants, and overgrown by\r\norchideous parasites in myriads; and the gutta-percha is also a native\r\nof these alluvial tracts. The forest-trees of the Indian Archipelago are\r\nalmost unknown; teak and many of the continental trees grow there, but\r\nthe greater number are peculiarly their own. The naturalist Rumphius had\r\na cabinet inlaid with 400 kinds of wood, the produce of Amboyna and the\r\nMolucca islands.\r\n\r\nSumatra, Java, and the adjacent islands, are the region of the\r\nDryobalanops camphora, in the stems of which solid lumps of a remarkable\r\nand costly kind of camphor are found. All the trees of that order, and\r\nof several others, are peculiar to these islands, and 78 species of\r\ntrees and shrubs of the Melastomaceous tribe grow there and in\r\ncontinental India. There are thickets of the sword-leaved vaquois-tree\r\nand of the Pandanus or screw-pine, a plant resembling the anana, with a\r\nblossom like that of a bulrush, very odoriferous, and in some species\r\nedible.\r\n\r\nThis is the region of spices, which are very limited in their\r\ndistribution: the Myristica moschata (the nutmeg and mace-plant) is\r\nconfined to the Banda Islands, but it is said to have been discovered\r\nlately in New Guinea. The Amboyna and the Molucca groups are the focus\r\nof the Caryophyllus aromaticus, a myrtle, the buds of which are known as\r\ncloves. Various species of cinnamon and cassia, both of the laurel\r\ntribe, together with varieties of pepper, different from those in India\r\nand Ceylon, grow in this archipelago. All the pepper-plants require\r\ngreat heat: they are rare in Africa, but plentiful in America and the\r\nIndian Archipelago; the common black pepper is peculiar to the hottest\r\nparts of Asia, extending only a few degrees on each side of the equator.\r\nIn 1842 more than 30,000,000 pounds weight of pepper were produced in\r\nSumatra alone. Some of the most excellent fruits are indigenous here\r\nonly, as the dourio, the ayer ayer, Loquat, the choapa of Molucca,\r\npeculiar kinds of orange, lemon, and citron, with others known only by\r\nname elsewhere. Those common to the continent of India are the jambrose,\r\nrose-apple, jack, various species of bread-fruit, mango, mangosteen, and\r\nthe banana, which is luxuriant.\r\n\r\nHere the nettle tribe assume the most pernicious character, and the\r\nupas-tree of Java, one of the most deadly vegetable poisons; and even\r\nthe plants resembling our common nettle are so acrid that the sting of\r\none in Java occasions not only pain but illness, which lasts for days. A\r\nnettle in the island of Timor, called by the natives the “Devil’s leaf,”\r\nis so poisonous that it produces long illness and even death. The\r\nchelik, a shrub growing in the dense forests, produces a poison even\r\nmore deadly than the upas. Some of the fig genus, which belongs also to\r\nthe natural order of nettles, have acrid juices. Trees of the cashew\r\ntribe have a milky sap: the fine japan lacquer is made from the juice of\r\nthe Stagmaria verniciflua. Barringtonia and palms are very splendid\r\nhere, the latter generally of peculiar species and limited in their\r\ndistribution, as the Nipa. No country is richer in club-mosses and\r\norchideous plants, which overrun the trees in thousands in the deep dark\r\nmountain-forests, choked by huge creeping plants, an undergrowth of\r\ngigantic grasses, through which not a ray of light penetrates.\r\n\r\nSir Stamford Raffles describes the vegetation of Java as “fearful.” In\r\nthese forests the air is heavy, charged with dank and deadly vapours,\r\nnever agitated by a breath of wind; the soil, of the deepest black\r\nvegetable mould, always moist and clammy, stimulated by the fervid heat\r\nof a tropical sun, produces trees whose stems are of a spongy texture\r\nfrom their rapid growth, loaded with parasites, particularly the\r\norchideous tribe, of which no less than 300 species are peculiar to that\r\nisland. Tree-ferns are in the proportion of one to twenty of the other\r\nplants, and form a large portion of the vegetation of Java and all these\r\nislands; and there are above 200 tropical species of club-mosses growing\r\nto the length of 3 feet, whereas in cold countries they creep on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe Rafflesias, of which there are four species, are the most singular\r\nproductions of this archipelago. The most extraordinary one is common to\r\nJava and Sumatra, where it was discovered by Dr. Arnold, and therefore\r\nis called Rafflesia Arnoldi. It is a parasitical plant, with buds the\r\nsize of an ordinary cabbage, and the flower, which smells of carrion, is\r\nof a brick-red colour, 3-1/2 feet in diameter: that found by Mr. Arnold\r\nweighed 15 pounds, and the cup in its centre could contain 12 pints of\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir Stamford Raffles there are six distinct climates in\r\nJava, from the top of the mountains to the sea, each having an extensive\r\nindigenous vegetation. No other country can show an equal abundance and\r\nvariety of native fruit and esculent vegetables. There are 100 varieties\r\nof rice, and of fragrant flowers, shrubs, and ornamental trees the\r\nnumber is infinite. Abundant as the Orchideæ are in Java, Ceylon, and\r\nthe Birmese empire, these countries possess very few that are common to\r\nthem all, so local is their distribution. Ferns are more plentiful in\r\nthis archipelago than elsewhere: tree-ferns are found chiefly between or\r\nnear the tropics, in airless damp places.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INDIAN FLORA.\r\n\r\nThe plains of Hindostan are so completely sheltered from the Siberian\r\nblasts by the high table-lands of Tartary and the Himalaya mountains,\r\nthat the vegetation at the foot of that range already assumes a tropical\r\ncharacter. In the jungles and lower ridges of the fertile valley of\r\nNepal, and on the dark and airless recesses of the Silhet forests,\r\narborescent ferns and orchideous plants are found in profusion, scarcely\r\nsurpassed even in the islands of the Indian Archipelago—indeed the\r\nmarshy Tariyane is full of them. The lowest ranges of the Himalaya, the\r\npestilential swamp of the Tariyane, the alluvial ridges of the hills\r\nthat bound it on the south, and many parts of the plains of the Ganges,\r\nare covered with primeval forests, which produce whole orders of large\r\ntimber-trees, frequently overrun with parasitical loranths.\r\n\r\nThe native fruits of India are many; the orange tribe is almost all of\r\nIndian origin, though some of the species are now widely spread over the\r\nwarmer parts of the other continents and the more distant countries of\r\nAsia. Two or three species are peculiar to Madagascar; one is found in\r\nthe forests of the Essequibo, and another in Brazil, which are the only\r\nexceptions known. The Limonia laureola grows on the tops of the high\r\nAsiatic mountains, which are covered with snow several months in the\r\nyear; and the wampee, a fruit much esteemed in China and the Indian\r\nArchipelago, is produced by a species of this order. The vine grows wild\r\nin the forests; plantain, banana, jambrose, guava, mango, mangosteen,\r\ndate, areca, palmyra, cocoa-nut, and gameto-palms are all Indian, also\r\nthe gourd family. The Scitamineæ, or ginger tribe, are so numerous, that\r\nthey form a distinguishing and beautiful feature of Indian botany: they\r\nproduce ginger, cardamoms, and turmeric. The flowers peculiar to India\r\nare brilliant in colours, but generally without odour, except the rose\r\nand some jessamines.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the trees and plants mentioned belong also to\r\ntropical India, where vegetation is still more luxuriant; a large\r\nportion of that magnificent country, containing 1,000,000 square miles,\r\nhas been cultivated time immemorial, although vast tracts still remain\r\nin a state of nature. Those extensive mountain-chains which traverse and\r\nsurround the Deccan are rich in primeval forests of stupendous growth\r\nwith dense underwood. The most remarkable of these trees are the Indian\r\ncotton-tree and the Dombeya, which is of the same order; that which\r\nproduces the Trincomalee wood, used for building boats at Madras; the\r\nred-wood tree, peculiar to the Coromandel coast, the satin-wood, the\r\nsuperb Butea frondosa, the agallochum tribe, which yields the odorous\r\nwood of aloes mentioned in Scripture, the Melaleuca leucadendron and the\r\nMelaleuca cajepute, from which the oil is prepared. The dragon’s-blood\r\ntree is a native of India, though not exclusively, as some of the best\r\nspecimens grow in Madagascar, where it is planted for hedges.\r\nSanders-wood and dragon’s-blood are obtained from the Pterocarpus\r\nsandalinus and Draco; the sappan-tree gives a purple dye: these are all\r\nof the leguminous or bean tribe, of which there are 452 Indian species:\r\nebony grows in these tropical regions, in Mauritius, and the south coast\r\nof Africa.\r\n\r\nSome of the fig tribe are among the most remarkable vegetable\r\nproductions of India for gigantic size and peculiarity of form, which\r\nrenders them valuable in a hot climate from the shade which their\r\nbroad-spreading tops afford. Some throw off shoots from their branches,\r\nwhich take root on reaching the ground, and, after increasing in girth\r\nwith wonderful rapidity, produce branches which also descend to form new\r\nroots, and this process is continued till a forest is formed round the\r\nparent tree. Mr. Reinwardt saw in the island of Simao a large wood of\r\nthe Ficus Benjamina which sprang from one stem. The Ficus Indica, or\r\nbanyan-tree, is another instance of this wide-spreading growth; it is\r\nfound in the islands, but is in greatest perfection around the villages\r\nin the Circar mountains: there is a tree of it on the banks of the\r\nNerbudda, in the province of Guzerat, with 350 main stems, occupying an\r\narea of 2000 feet in circumference, independent of its branches, which\r\nextend much farther. The camphor genus is mostly Indian, as well as many\r\nmore of the laurel tribe of great size. The banana is the most generally\r\nuseful tree in this country; its fruit is food, its leaves are applied\r\nto many domestic purposes, and flax fit for making muslin is obtained\r\nfrom its stem. Cotton is a hairy covering of the seeds of several\r\nspecies of the mallow tribe which grow spontaneously in tropical Asia,\r\nAfrica, and America; it is, however, cultivated in many countries beyond\r\nthese limits. That grown in China and the United States of America is an\r\nherbaceous annual from 18 inches to 2 feet high: there are also\r\ncotton-trees, native and cultivated, in India, China, Africa, and\r\nAmerica. Herodotus mentions cotton garments 445 years before the\r\nChristian era, and the Mexicans manufactured cotton cloth before the\r\ndiscovery of America.\r\n\r\nPalms, the most stately and graceful of the vegetable productions of\r\ntropical regions, are abundant in India, in forests, in groups, and in\r\nsingle trees. Some species grow at the limit of perpetual snow, some 900\r\nfeet above the sea, others in valleys and on the shores of the continent\r\nand islands. They decrease in number and variety as the latitude\r\nincreases, and terminate at Nice, in 44° N. lat., their limit in the\r\ngreat continent. The leaves of some are of gigantic size, and all are\r\nbeautiful, varying in height from the slender Calamus rotang, 130 feet\r\nhigh, to the Chamærops humilis, not more than 15 or 20. Different\r\nspecies yield wine, oil, wax, flour, sugar, thread, and rope; weapons\r\nand utensils are made of their stems and leaves; they serve for the\r\nconstruction of houses; the cocoa-nut palm gives food and drink; sago is\r\nmade from all except the Areca catechu, the fruit of which, the\r\nbetel-nut, is used by the natives for its intoxicating quality.\r\n\r\nThough palms in general are very limited in their distribution, a few\r\nspecies are very widely spread; for example, the cocoa-nut palm, which\r\ngrows spontaneously on the southern coasts of the Indo-Chinese peninsula\r\nand the Sunda Islands, from whence it has been carried to all the\r\nintertropical regions of the globe, where it has been extensively\r\ncultivated from its usefulness. So luxuriant is its growth in Ceylon,\r\nthat in one year nearly 3,000,000 of nuts were exported; in parts of\r\nthat island, on the Malabar and Coromandel coasts, and in some districts\r\nin Bengal, the Borassus flabelliformis supplies its place.\r\n\r\nThe island of Ceylon, which may be regarded as the southernmost\r\nextremity of the Indian peninsula, is very mountainous, and rivals the\r\nislands of the Indian Archipelago in luxuriance of vegetable\r\nproductions, and, in some respects, bears a strong resemblance to them.\r\nThe laurel, the bark of which is cinnamon, is indigenous, and one of the\r\nprincipal sources of the revenue of Ceylon. The taleput leaves of a\r\nspecies of palm are of such enormous size, that they are applied to many\r\nuses by the Cingalese; in ancient times strips of the leaf were written\r\nupon with a sharp style, and served as books. The sandalwood of Ceylon\r\nis of a different species from that of the South Sea islands, and its\r\nperfume more esteemed. Indigo is indigenous, and so is the choya, whose\r\nroots give a scarlet dye. The mountains produce a great variety of\r\nbeautiful woods used in cabinet-work. It is a remarkable circumstance in\r\nthe distribution of plants, that the orchideæ are very numerous in this\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ARABIAN VEGETATION.\r\n\r\nThe third division of the tropical flora of Asia is the Arabian, which\r\ndiffers widely from the other two, and is chiefly marked by trees\r\nyielding balsams. Oceans of barren sand extend to the south, from Syria\r\nthrough the greater part of Arabia, varied only by occasional oases in\r\nthose spots where a spring of water has reached the surface; there the\r\nprevalent vegetation consists of the grasses, Holcus and Panicum\r\ndicotomum growing under the shade of the date-palm; mimosas and stunted\r\nprickly bushes appear here and there in the sand. There is verdure on\r\nthe mountains, and along some of the coasts, especially in the province\r\nof Yemen, which has a flora of its own. The Keura odorifera, a superb\r\ntree, with agreeable perfume, eight species of figs, the three species\r\nof Amyris—gileadensis, or balm of Gilead, opobalsamum also yielding\r\nbalsam, and the kataf, from which myrrh is supposed to come—are peculiar\r\nto Arabia. Frankincense is said to be the produce of the Boswellia\r\nserrata; and there are many species of Acacia, among others the Acacia\r\narabica, which produces gum arabic. The arak and tamarind trees connect\r\nthe botany of Arabia with that of the West Indies, while it is connected\r\nwith that of the Cape of Good Hope by Stapelias, mesembryanthemums, and\r\nliliaceous flowers. The character of Arabian vegetation, like that of\r\nother dry hot climates, consists in its odoriferous plants and flowers.\r\n\r\nArabia produces coffee, which, however, is not indigenous, but is\r\nsupposed to have come from the table-land of Ethiopia, and to have its\r\nname from the province of Kaffa, where it forms dense forests. It was\r\nintroduced into Arabia in the end of the fifteenth century, and grows\r\nluxuriantly in Arabia Felix, where the coffee is of the highest flavour.\r\nMost of that now used is the progeny of plants raised from seed and\r\nbrought from Mocha to the Botanic Garden at Amsterdam in 1690, by Van\r\nHoorn, Governor of Batavia. A plant was sent to Louis XIV., in 1714, by\r\nthe magistrates of Amsterdam—it was from this plant that the first\r\ncoffee-plants were introduced in 1717 into the West India islands. A\r\nyear afterwards the Dutch introduced coffee-trees into Surinam, from\r\nwhence they spread rapidly over the warm parts of America and the West\r\nIndia islands. Many thousands of people are now employed in its\r\ncultivation there, in Demerara, Java, Manilla, the isle of Bourbon, and\r\nother places. More than 3,000,000 pounds of coffee-beans are produced,\r\nand 100,000 tons of shipping are annually employed in its transport\r\nacross the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Coffee was not known till many\r\ncenturies after the introduction of sugar. The first coffee-house was\r\nopened in London in 1652, and the first in France, at Marseilles, in\r\n1671.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nAfrican Flora—Flora of Australia, New Zealand, Norfolk Island, and of\r\n  Polynesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE northern coast of Africa, and the range of the Atlas generally, may\r\nbe regarded as a zone of transition, where the plants of southern Europe\r\nare mingled with those peculiar to the country; half the plants of\r\nnorthern Africa are also found in the other countries on the shores of\r\nthe Mediterranean. Of 60 trees and 248 shrubs which grow there, 100 only\r\nare peculiar to Africa, and about 18 of these belong to its tropical\r\nflora. There are about six times as many herbaceous plants as there are\r\ntrees and shrubs; and in the Atlas mountains, as in other chains, the\r\nperennial plants are much more numerous than annuals. Evergreens\r\npredominate, and are the same as those on the other shores of the\r\nMediterranean. The pomegranite, the locust-tree, the oleander, and the\r\npalmetto abound; and the cistus tribe give a distinct character to the\r\nflora. The sandarach, or Thuia articulata, peculiar to the northern side\r\nof the Atlas mountains and to Cyrenaica, yields close-grained hard\r\ntimber, used for the ceiling of mosques, and is supposed to be the\r\nshittim-wood of Scripture. The Atlas produces seven or eight species of\r\noak, various pines, especially the Pinus maritima, and forests of the\r\nAleppo pine in Algiers. The sweet-scented arborescent heath and Erica\r\nscoparia are native here, also in the Canary Islands and the Azores,\r\nwhere the tribe of house-leeks characterizes the botany. There are 534\r\nphanerogamous plants, or such as have the parts of fructification\r\nevident, in the Canary Islands; of these, 310 are indigenous, the rest\r\nAfrican: the Pinus canariensis is peculiar, and also the Dracænæ, which\r\ngrow in perfection here. The stem of the Dracæna Draco, of the Villa\r\nOratava in Teneriffe, measures 46 feet in circumference at the base of\r\nthe tree, which is 75 feet high. It is known to have been an object of\r\ngreat antiquity in the year 1402, and is still alive, bearing blossoms\r\nand fruit. If it be not an instance of the partial location of plants,\r\nthere must have been intercourse between India and the Canary Islands in\r\nvery ancient times.\r\n\r\nPlants with bluish-green succulent leaves are characteristic of tropical\r\nAfrica and its islands; and though the group of the Canaries has plants\r\nin common with Spain, Portugal, Africa, and the Azores, yet there are\r\nmany species, and even genera, which are found in them only; and the\r\nheight of the mountains causes much variety in the vegetation.\r\n\r\nOn the continent, south of the Atlas, a great change of soil and climate\r\ntakes place; the drought on the borders of the desert is so excessive\r\nthat no trees can resist it, rain hardly ever falls, and the scorching\r\nblasts from the south speedily dry up any moisture that may exist; yet,\r\nin consequence of what descends from the mountains, the date-palm forms\r\nlarge forests along their base, which supply the inhabitants with food,\r\nand give shelter to crops which could not otherwise grow. The date-palm,\r\neach tree of which yields from 150 to 160 pounds weight of fruit, grows\r\nnaturally, and is also cultivated, through northern Africa. It has been\r\ncarried to the Canary Islands, Arabia, the Persian Gulf, and to Nice,\r\nthe most northern limit of the palm-tribe. Stunted plants are the only\r\nproduce of the desert, yet large tracts are covered with the Pennisetum\r\ndichotomum, a harsh prickly grass, which, together with the Alhagi\r\nmaurorum, is the food of camels.\r\n\r\nThe plants peculiar to Egypt are acacias, mimosas, cassias, tamarisks,\r\nthe Nymphæa Lotus, the blue Lotus, the Papyrus, from which probably the\r\nfirst substance used for writing upon was made, and has left its name to\r\nthat we now use; also the Zizyphus or jujub, various mesembryanthemums,\r\nand most of the plants of Barbary grow here. The date-palm is not found\r\nhigher on the Nile than Thebes, where it gives place to the doom-palm or\r\nCucifera Thebaica, peculiar to this district, and singular as being the\r\nonly palm that has a branched stem.\r\n\r\nThe eastern side of equatorial Africa is less known than the western,\r\nbut the floras of the two countries, under the same latitude, have\r\nlittle affinity: on the eastern side the Rubiaceæ, the Euphorbiæ, a race\r\npeculiarly African, and the Malvaceæ, are most frequent. The genus\r\nDanais of the coffee tribe distinguishes the vegetation of Abyssinia,\r\nalso the Dombeya, a species of vine, various jessamines, a beautiful\r\nspecies of honeysuckle; and Bruce says a caper-tree grows to the height\r\nof the elm, with white blossoms, and fruit as large as a peach. The\r\ndaroo, or Ficus sycomorus, and the arak-tree, are native. The kollquall,\r\nor Euphorbia antiquorum, grows 40 feet high on the plain of Baharnagach,\r\nin the form of an elegant branched candelabrum, covered with scented\r\nfruit. The kantuffa or thornby shrub, is so great a nuisance from its\r\nspines, that even animals avoid it. The Erythrina Abyssinica bears a\r\npoisonous red bean with a black spot, used by the shangalla and other\r\ntribes for ages as a weight for gold, and by the women as necklaces. Mr.\r\nRochet has lately brought some seeds of new grain from Shoa, that are\r\nlikely to be a valuable addition to European cerealia.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of tropical Africa on the west is known only along the\r\ncoast, where some affinity with that of India may be observed. It\r\nconsists of 573 species of flower-bearing plants, and is distinguished\r\nby a remarkable uniformity, not only in orders and genera, but even in\r\nspecies, from the 16th degree of N. lat. to the river Congo in 6° S.\r\nlat. The most prevalent are the grasses and bean tribes, the Cyperaceæ\r\nRubiaceæ, and the Compositæ. The Adansonia, or baobab of Senegal, is one\r\nof the most extraordinary vegetable productions; the stem is sometimes\r\n34 feet in diameter, though the tree is rarely more than 50 or 60 feet\r\nhigh; it covers the sandy plains so entirely with its umbrella-shaped\r\ntop, that a forest of these trees presents a compact surface, which at\r\nsome distance seems to be a green field. Cape Verde has its name from\r\nthe numbers that conceal the barren soil under their spreading tops;\r\nsome of them are very old, and, with the dragon-tree at Teneriffe, are\r\nsupposed to be the most ancient vegetable inhabitants of the earth. The\r\nPandanus candelabrum, instead of growing crowded together in masses like\r\nthe baobab, stands solitary on the equatorial plains, with its lofty\r\nforked branches ending in tufts of long stiff leaves. Numerous sedges,\r\nof which the Papyrus is the most remarkable, give a character to this\r\nregion, and cover boundless plains, waving in the wind like corn-fields,\r\nwhile other places are overgrown by forests of gigantic grasses with\r\nbranching stems.\r\n\r\nA rich vegetation, consisting of impenetrable thickets of mangrove, the\r\npoisonous manchineel, and many large trees, cover the deltas of the\r\nrivers, and even grow so far into the water, that their trunks are\r\ncoated with shell-fish; but the pestilential exhalations render it\r\nalmost certain death to botanize in this luxuriance of nature.\r\n\r\nVarious kinds of the soap or sapodilla trees are peculiar to Africa; the\r\nbutter-tree of the enterprising but unfortunate Mungo Park, the\r\nstar-apple, the cream-fruit, the custard-apple, and the water-vine, are\r\nplentiful in Senegal and Sierra Leone. The ibraculea is peculiarly\r\nAfrican; its seeds are used to sweeten brackish water. The safu and\r\nbread-fruit of Polynesia are represented here by the musanga, a large\r\ntree of the nettle tribe, the fruit of which has the flavour of the\r\nhazel-nut. A few palms have very local habitations, as the Elais\r\nGuineensis, or palm-oil plant, found only on that coast. That graceful\r\ntribe is less varied in species in equatorial Africa than in the other\r\ncontinents. It appears that a great part of the flora of this portion of\r\nAfrica is of foreign origin.\r\n\r\nThe flora of south Africa differs entirely from that of the northern and\r\ntropical zones, and as widely from that of every other country, with the\r\nexception of Australia and some parts of Chile. The soil of the\r\ntable-land at the Cape of Good Hope, stretching to an unknown distance,\r\nand of the Karoo plains and valleys between the mountains, is sometimes\r\ngravelly, but more frequently is composed of sand and clay; in summer it\r\nis dry and parched, and most of its rivers are dried up; it bears but a\r\nfew stunted shrubs, some succulent plants and mimosas, along the margin\r\nof the river-courses. The sudden effect of rain on the parched ground is\r\nlike magic: it is recalled to life, and in a short time is decked with a\r\nbeautiful and peculiar vegetation, comprehending, more than any other\r\ncountry, numerous and distinctly-defined foci of genera and species.\r\n\r\nTwelve thousand species of plants have been collected in the colony of\r\nthe Cape in an extent of country about equal to Germany. Of these,\r\nheaths and proteas are two very conspicuous tribes; there are 300\r\nspecies of the former, and 200 of the latter, both of which have nearly\r\nthe same limited range, though Mr. Bunbury found two heaths, and the\r\nProtea cynaroides, the most splendid of the family (bearing a flower the\r\nsize of a man’s hat), on the hills round Graham’s Town, in the eastern\r\npart of the colony. These two tribes of plants are so limited that there\r\nis not one of either to be seen north of the mountains which bound the\r\nGreat Karoo, and by much the greatest number of them grew within 100\r\nmiles of Cape Town; indeed at the distance of only 40 miles the\r\nprevailing Proteaceæ are different from those at the Cape. The\r\nLeucadendron argenteum, or silver-tree, which forms groves at the back\r\nof the table-mountain, is confined to the peninsula of the Cape. The\r\nbeautiful Disa grandiflora is found only in one particular place on the\r\ntop of the table-mountain.\r\n\r\nThe dry sand of the west coast, and the country northward through many\r\ndegrees of latitude, is the native habitation of Stapelias, succulent\r\nplants with square leafless stems, and flowers like star-fish, with the\r\nsmell of carrion. A great portion of the eastern frontier of the Cape\r\ncolony and the adjacent districts is covered with extensive thickets of\r\na strong succulent and thorny vegetation, called by the natives the\r\nbush: similar thickets occur again far to the west, on the banks of the\r\nriver Gauritz. The most common plants of the bush are aloes of many\r\nspecies, all exceedingly fleshy and some beautiful: the great\r\nred-flowering arborescent aloe, and some others, make a conspicuous\r\nfigure in the eastern part of the colony. Other characteristic plants of\r\nthe eastern districts are the spek-boem, or Portulacaria afra, Schotia\r\nspeciosa, and the great succulent euphorbias, which grow into real trees\r\n40 feet high, branching like a candelabrum, entirely leafless, prickly,\r\nand with a very acrid juice. The Euphorbia meloformis, three feet in\r\ndiameter, lies on the ground, to which it is attached by slender fibrous\r\nroots, and is confined to the mountains of Graaf Reynet. Euphorbias, in\r\nthe Old World, correspond with the Cactus tribe, which belong\r\nexclusively to the New. The Zamia, a singular plant, having the\r\nappearance of a dwarf-palm, without any real similarity of structure,\r\nbelongs to the eastern districts, especially to the great tract of bush\r\non the Caffir frontier.\r\n\r\nVarious species of Acacia are indigenous and much circumscribed in their\r\nlocation: the Acacia horrida, or the white-thorned acacia, is very\r\ncommon in the eastern districts and in Caffirland. The Acacia cafra is\r\nstrictly eastern, growing along the margins of rivers, to which it is a\r\ngreat ornament. The Acacia detinens, or hook-thorn, is almost peculiar\r\nto Zand valley.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from the instances mentioned, that the vegetation in the\r\neastern districts of the colony differs from that on the western, yet\r\nmany plants are generally diffused of orders and genera found only in\r\nthis part of Africa:—Nearly all the 300 species of the fleshy succulent\r\ntribe of Mesembryanthemum, or Hottentot’s fig; a great many beautiful\r\nspecies of the Oxalis, or wood-sorrel-tribe; every species of Gladiolus,\r\nwith the exception of that in the cornfields in Italy and France; ixias\r\ninnumerable, one with petals of apple-green colour; geraniums,\r\nespecially the genus Pelargonium, or stork’s bill, almost peculiar to\r\nthis locality; many varieties of Gnaphalium and Xeranthemum; the\r\nbrilliant Strelitzia; 133 species of the house-leek tribe, all fleshy,\r\nattached to the soil by a strong wiry root, and nourished more or less\r\nfrom the atmosphere: Diosmas are widely scattered in great variety;\r\nshrubby Boragineæ with flowers of vivid colours, and Orchideæ with large\r\nand showy blossoms. The leguminous plants and Cruciferæ of the Cape are\r\npeculiar; indeed all the vegetation has a distinct character, and both\r\ngenera and species are confined within narrower limits than anywhere\r\nelse, without any apparent cause to account for a dispersion so\r\narbitrary.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the peculiarity of character with which the botany of\r\nthe Cape is so distinctly marked, it is connected with that of very\r\nremote countries by particular plants; for example, of the seven species\r\nof bramble which grow at the Cape, one is the common English bramble or\r\nblackberry. The affinity with New Holland is greater: in portions of the\r\ntwo countries in the same latitude there are several genera and species\r\nthat are identical: Proteaceæ are common to both, so are several genera\r\nof Irideæ, Leguminosæ, Ficoideæ, Myrtaceæ, Diosmeæ, and some others. The\r\nbotany of the Cape is connected with that of India, and even that of\r\nSouth America, by a few congeners.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of Madagascar, though similar in many respects to the\r\nfloras of India and Africa, nevertheless is its own: the Brexiaceæ and\r\nChlenaceæ are orders found nowhere else: there are species of Bignonia,\r\nCycadeæ, and Zamias, a few of the mangosteen tribe, and in the mountains\r\nsome heaths. The Hydrogeton fenestralis is a singular aquatic plant,\r\nwith leaves like the dried skeletons of leaves, having no green fleshy\r\nsubstance, and the Tanghinia veneniflua, which produces a poison so\r\ndeadly that its seeds are used to execute criminals, and one seed is\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nSome genera and species are common and peculiar to Madagascar, the Isle\r\nof Bourbon, and Mauritius; yet of the 161 known genera in Madagascar\r\nonly 54 grow on the other two islands. The three islands are rich in\r\nferns. The Pandanus, or screw-pine genus, abounds in Bourbon and the\r\nMauritius, where it covers sandy plains, sending off strong aërial roots\r\nfrom the stem, which strike into the ground and protect the plant from\r\nthe violent winds. Of 290 genera in Bourbon and Mauritius, 196 also grow\r\nin India, though the species are different: there is also some\r\nresemblance to the vegetation of South Africa, and there is a solitary\r\ngenus in common with America.\r\n\r\nEight or ten degrees north of Madagascar lies the group of the\r\nSeychelles Islands, in which are groves of the peculiar palm which bears\r\nthe double cocoa-nut, or coco de mer, the growth of these islands only.\r\nIts gigantic leaves are employed in the construction of houses, and\r\nother parts of the plant are applied to various domestic purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          FLORA OF AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the Australian continent is so little known, that the\r\nflora which has come under observation is confined to a short distance\r\nfrom the coast; but it is of so strange and unexampled a character, that\r\nit might easily be mistaken for the production of another planet. Many\r\nentire orders of plants are known only in Australia, and the genera and\r\nspecies of others that grow elsewhere assume new and singular forms.\r\nEvergreens, with hard narrow leaves of a sombre, melancholy hue, are\r\nprevalent, and there are whole shadowless forests of leafless trees; the\r\nfoot-stalks, dilated and set edgewise on the stem, supply their place\r\nand perform the functions of nutrition; their altered position gives\r\nthem a singular appearance. Plants in other countries have glands on the\r\nunder side of the leaves, but in Australia there are glands on both\r\nsides of these substitutes for leaves, which make them dull and\r\nlustreless, and the changes of the seasons have no influence on the\r\nunvarying olive-green of the Australian forests; even the grasses are\r\ndistinguished from the gramineæ of other countries by a remarkable\r\nrigidity. Torres Straits, in the north, only 50 miles broad, separates\r\nthis dry, sombre vegetation from the luxuriant jungle-clad shores of New\r\nGuinea, where deep and dark forests are rich in more than the usual\r\ntropical exuberance—a more complete and sudden change can hardly be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarly Australian vegetation is in the southern part of the\r\ncontinent of New Holland distributed in distinct foci in the same\r\nlatitude, a circumstance of which the Proteaceæ afford a remarkable\r\ninstance. Nearly one-half of the known species of these beautiful shrubs\r\ngrow in the parallel of Port Jackson, from which they decrease in number\r\nboth to the south and the north. In that latitude, however, there are\r\ntwice as many species on the eastern side of the continent as there are\r\non the western, and four times as many as in the centre. Although the\r\nProteaceæ at both extremities of the continent have all the characters\r\npeculiar to Australia, yet those on the eastern coast resemble the South\r\nAmerican species, while those on the western side have a resemblance to\r\nAfrican forms, and are confined to the same latitudes.\r\n\r\nSpecies of this family are numerous in Van Diemen’s Land; where they\r\nthrive at the elevation of 3500 feet, and also on the plains. The myrtle\r\ntribe form a conspicuous feature in Australian vegetation, particularly\r\nthe genera Eucalyptus, Melaleuca, Beaufortia, and others, with splendid\r\nblossoms—white, purple, yellow, crimson: 100 species of the Eucalypti,\r\nmost of them large trees, grow in New Holland; they form great forests\r\nin the colony of Port Jackson. The leafless acacias, of which there are\r\n93 species, are a prominent feature in the Australian landscape. The\r\nleaves, except in very young plants, are merely foliaceous foot-stalks,\r\npresenting their margin towards the stem; yet these and the Eucalypti\r\nform the densest shade of any trees in the country. The genus Casuarina,\r\nwith its strange-jointed, drooping branches, called the marsh-oak, holds\r\na conspicuous place; it is chiefly confined to the principal parallel of\r\nthis vegetation, and produces excellent timber; it grows also in the\r\nMalayan peninsula and South Sea islands. The Oxleya xanthoxylon or\r\nyellow wood, one of the mahogany tribe, grows to great size, and the\r\nPodocarpus aspleniifolia forms a new genus of the cone-bearing trees.\r\nSome of the nettle tribe grow 15 or even 20 feet high. The Epacrideæ,\r\nwith scarlet, rose, and white blossoms, supply the place of, and very\r\nmuch resemble, heaths, which do not exist here. The purple-flowering\r\nTremandreæ; the yellow-flowering Dilleniaceæ; the Doryanthes excelsa,\r\nthe most splendid of the lily tribe, 24 feet high, with a brilliant\r\ncrimson blossom; the Banksia, the most Australian of all the Proteaceæ;\r\nwith Zamias of new species, are all conspicuous in the vegetation of\r\nPort Jackson.\r\n\r\nThere is a change on the north-eastern coast of New Holland. The\r\nCastanospermum Australe is so plentiful that it furnishes the principal\r\nfood of the natives; a caper-tree of grotesque form, having the colossal\r\ndimensions of the Senegal baobab, and extraordinary trees of the fig\r\ngenus, characterize this region. It sometimes occurs, when the seeds of\r\nthese fig-trees are deposited by birds on the iron-bark-tree, or\r\nEucalyptus resinifera, that they vegetate and enclose the trunk of the\r\ntree entirely with their roots, whence they send off enormous lateral\r\nbranches, which so completely envelop the tree, that at last its top\r\nalone is visible in the centre of the fig-tree, at the height of 70 or\r\n80 feet. The Pandanus genus flourishes within the influence of the\r\nsea-air. There are only six species of palms, equally local in their\r\nhabitations as elsewhere, not one of which grows on the west side of the\r\ncontinent. The Araucaria excelsa, or Norfolk Island pine, produces the\r\nbest timber of any tree in this part of Australia: it, or others of the\r\nsame genus, extends from the parallel of 29° on the east coast towards\r\nthe equator, and grows over an area of 900 square miles, including New\r\nNorfolk, New Caledonia, and other islands, some of which have no other\r\ntimber-tree: they are supposed to exist only within the influence of the\r\nsea. The Asphodeleæ abound and extend to the southern extremity of Van\r\nDieman’s Land.\r\n\r\nThe south-western districts of New Holland exhibit another focus of\r\nvegetation, less rich in species than that of Port Jackson, but not less\r\npeculiar. The Kingia Australis, or grass-tree, rises solitary on the\r\nsandy plains, with bare blackened trunks as if scathed by lightning,\r\noccasioned by the fires of the natives, and tufts of long grassy leaves\r\nat their extremities; Banksias, particularly the kind called wild\r\nhoneysuckle, are numerous; the Stylidium, whose blossoms are even more\r\nirritable than the leaves of the sensitive mimosa, and plants with dry,\r\neverlasting blossoms, characterize the flora of these districts. The\r\ngreater part of the southern vegetation vanishes on the northern coasts\r\nof the continent, and what remains is mingled with the cabbage-palm,\r\nvarious species of the nutmeg tribe, sandal-wood, and other Malayan\r\nforms—a circumstance that may hereafter be of importance to our\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\nOrchideæ, chiefly terrestrial, are in great variety in the\r\nextra-tropical regions of New Holland, and the grasses amount to\r\none-fourth of the monocotyledonous plants. Reeds of gigantic size form\r\nforests in the marshes, and kangaroo-grass covers the plains.\r\n\r\nBeautiful and varied as the flora is, New Holland is by no means\r\nluxuriant in vegetation. There is little appearance of verdure, the\r\nfoliage is poor, the forests often shadeless, and the grass thin; but in\r\nmany valleys of the mountains, and even on some parts of the plains, the\r\nvegetation is vigorous. It is not the least remarkable circumstance in\r\nthis extraordinary flora, that, with the exception of a few berries,\r\nthere is no edible fruit, grain, or vegetable indigenous either in New\r\nHolland or Van Diemen’s Land.\r\n\r\nThe plants of New Holland prevail in every part of Van Diemen’s Land;\r\nyet the coldness of the climate and the height of the mountains permit\r\ngenera of the northern hemisphere to be mixed with the vegetation of the\r\ncountry. Butter-cups, anemones, and polygonums of peculiar species grow\r\non the mountain-tops, together with Proteaceæ and other Australian\r\nplants. The plains glow with the warm golden flowers of the black\r\nwattle, a Mimosa, emblematic of the island, and with the equally bright\r\nand orange blossom of the gorse, which perfumes the whole atmosphere.\r\nOnly one tree-fern grows in this country; it rises 20 feet to the base\r\nof the fronds, which spread into an elegant top, producing a shadow\r\ngloomy as night-fall, and there are 150 species of orchis. The southern\r\nextremities both of New Holland and Van Diemen’s Land are characterized\r\nby the prevalence of evergreen plants: but the trees here, as well as in\r\nthe other parts of the southern hemisphere, do not shed their leaves\r\nperiodically as with us.\r\n\r\nThe botany of New Zealand appears to be intimately allied to that of New\r\nHolland, South America, and South Africa, but chiefly to that of New\r\nHolland. Noble trees form impenetrable forests, 60 of which yield the\r\nfinest timber, and many are of kinds to which we have nothing similar.\r\nHere there are no representatives of our oak, birch, or willow, but five\r\nspecies of beech and ten of Coniferæ have been discovered that are\r\npeculiar to the country. They are all alpine, and only descend to the\r\nlevel of the sea in the southern parts of the island. The Coniferæ of\r\nthe southern hemisphere are more local than in the northern; of the ten\r\nspecies peculiar to New Zealand it is not certain that more than two or\r\nthree are found in the middle island, or that any of them grow south of\r\nthe 40th parallel. The Kauri pine, or Dammara australis, is indigenous\r\nin all the three islands, but it is the only cone-bearing tree in North\r\nIsland, where it grows in hilly situations near the sea, shooting up\r\nwith a clean stem 60 or 90 feet, sometimes 30 feet in diameter, with a\r\nspreading but thin top, and generally has a quantity of transparent\r\nyellow resin imbedded at its base. This fine tree does not grow beyond\r\nthe 38th degree of S. lat. The Metrosideros tomentosa, with rich crimson\r\nblossoms, is one of the greatest ornaments of the forests, and the\r\nMetrosideros robusta the most singular. It grows to a very great size,\r\nand sends shoots from its trunk and branches to the ground, which become\r\nso massive that they support the old stem, which to all appearance loses\r\nits vitality; it is in fact an enormous epiphyte, growing to, and not\r\nfrom, the ground. Many of the smaller trees are of the laurel tribe,\r\nwith poisonous berries. Besides, there is a cabbage-palm, the Areca\r\nsapida, elder, the Fuchsia excorticata, and other shrubs. This country\r\nis probably the southern limit of the orchideous plants that grow on\r\ntrees. Before New Zealand was colonized, the natives lived chiefly on\r\nthe roots of the edible fern, Pteris esculenta, with which the country\r\nis densely covered, mixed with a shrub that grows like a cypress, and\r\nthe tea-plant, which is a kind of myrtle whose berries afford an\r\nintoxicating liquor. More than 140 species of fern are natives of these\r\nislands, some of which are arborescent and 40 feet high; the country is\r\nchiefly covered with these and with the New Zealand flax, Phormium\r\ntenax, which grows abundantly both on the mountains and plains. The\r\nvegetation is so vigorous on these volcanic islands that it grows richly\r\non the banks of hot springs, and even in water too hot to be\r\ntouched.[161]\r\n\r\nIn Norfolk Island, 152 species of plants are already known, and many, no\r\ndoubt, are yet to be discovered. The Cape gooseberry or Physalis edulis,\r\nthe guava-tree, pepper, white and swamp oak, iron, blood-wood, and lemon\r\ntrees, are native; also the bread-fruit tree, which blossoms, but does\r\nnot bear fruit. The Araucaria excelsa and some palms are indigenous, and\r\nthere are three times as many ferns as of all the other plants together.\r\n\r\nThe multitude of islands of Polynesia constitute a botanical region\r\napart from all others, though it is but little varied, and characterized\r\nprincipally by the number of syngenesious plants with arborescent terms\r\nand tree-ferns. In continental India and the tropical parts of New\r\nHolland, the proportion of ferns to conspicuously-flowering plants is as\r\n1 to 26, while on the Polynesian islands it is as 1 to 4, and perhaps\r\neven as 1 to 3.[162]\r\n\r\nThe cocoa-nut palm and the pandanus are common to all the islands, but\r\nthe latter thrives only when exposed to the sea-air. This archipelago\r\nproduces Tacca pinnatifida, which yields arrow-root; the Morus\r\npapyrifera, whose bark is manufactured into paper; and one of the\r\nDracæna tribe, from which an intoxicating liquor is made. Fifty\r\nvarieties of the bread-fruit tree are indigenous, which produce three or\r\nfour crops annually. It is most abundant in the Friendly, Society, and\r\nCaroline groups, from whence it has been taken to America, where it\r\nthrives in very low latitudes. The Sandwich group is peculiar in the\r\nnumber of Goodenias and Lobelias; while the Coral Islands, whose flora\r\nis entirely borrowed, rarely have two species belonging to the same\r\ngenus; the fragrant suriana and sweet-scented Tournfortia are among\r\ntheir scanty vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe two species of banana-trees which are natives of southern Asia have\r\nbeen introduced at an unknown and probably early period into the\r\nPolynesian islands, and all tropical countries in the eastern and\r\nwestern hemispheres. Syria is their northern limit, where the Musa\r\nparadisaica grows to 34° N. lat. The sweet fruit of these trees\r\nproduces, on the same extent of ground, 44 times as much nutriment as\r\nthe potato, and 133 times more than wheat.\r\n\r\nSt. Helena, the Sandwich group, New Zealand, Juan Fernandez, and above\r\nall the Galapagos islands, are more peculiar in their floras than any\r\nother tracts of their size. The Galapagos archipelago consists of 10\r\nprincipal islands lying immediately under the equator, 600 miles from\r\nthe coast of America. They are entirely volcanic, and contain 2000\r\nextinct craters. The vegetation is so peculiar that, of 180 plants which\r\nhave been collected, 100 are found nowhere else; of 21 species of\r\nCompositæ all but one are new, and belong to 10 genera, 8 of which are\r\nconfined to these islands exclusively.\r\n\r\nThis flora has no analogy to that of Polynesia, but it bears a double\r\nrelation to the flora of South America. The plants peculiar to the\r\nGalapagos islands are, for the most part, allied to those on the cooler\r\npart of the continent or on high lands, while the others are the same\r\nwith those that abound in the hot damp intertropical regions of the\r\ncontinent. The greatest number of peculiar plants grow on the tops of\r\nthe islands where the sea vapour is condensed, and many of them are\r\nconfined to some one islet of the group. Though this flora is singular,\r\nit is poor compared with that of the Sandwich group, or the Cape de\r\nVerde Islands.[163]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nAmerican Vegetation—Flora of North, Central, and South America—Antarctic\r\n  Flora—Origin and Distribution of the Cerealia—Ages of Trees—Marine\r\n  Vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM similarity of physical circumstances the arctic flora of America\r\nbears a strong resemblance to that of the northern regions of Europe and\r\nAsia. This botanical district comprises Greenland, and extends\r\nconsiderably to the south of the arctic circle, especially at the\r\neastern and western ends of the continent, where it reaches the 60th\r\nparallel of N. lat., and even more; it is continued along the tops of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains almost to Mexico, and it re-appears on the White\r\nMountains and a few other parts of the Alleghanies.\r\n\r\nGreenland has a much more arctic flora than Iceland; the valleys are\r\nentirely covered with mosses and marsh-plants, and the gloomy rocks are\r\ncased in sombre lichens that grow under the snow, and the grasses on the\r\npasture-grounds that line the fiords are nearly four times less varied\r\nthan those of Iceland. In some sheltered spots the service-tree bears\r\nfruit, and birches grow to the height of a few feet: but ligneous plants\r\nin general trail on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe arctic flora of America has much the same character with that of\r\nEurope and Asia, and many species are common to all; still more are\r\nrepresentative, but there is a difference in the vegetation at the two\r\nextremities of the continent; there are 30 species in the east and 20 in\r\nthe west end which grow nowhere else. The sameness of character changes\r\nwith the barren treeless lands at the verge of the Arctic region, and\r\nthe distribution of plants varies both with the latitude and the\r\nlongitude. Taking a broad view of the botanical districts of North\r\nAmerica, there are two woody regions, one on the eastern, the other on\r\nthe western side of the continent, separated by a region of prairies\r\nwhere grasses and herbaceous plants predominate. The vegetation of these\r\nthree parts, so dissimilar, varies with the latitude, but not after the\r\nsame law as in Europe, for the winter is much colder and the summer\r\nwarmer on the eastern coasts of America than on the western coast of\r\nEurope, owing, in a great measure, to the prevalence of westerly winds\r\nwhich bring cold and damp to our shores.\r\n\r\nBoundless forests of black and white spruce, with an undergrowth of\r\nreindeer moss, cover the country south of the Arctic region, which are\r\nafterwards mixed with other trees; gooseberries, strawberries, currants,\r\nand some other plants thrive there. There are vast forests in Canada of\r\npines, oak, ash, hickory, red beech, birch, the lofty Canadian poplar,\r\nsometimes 100 feet high and 36 feet in circumference, and sugar-maple;\r\nthe prevailing plants are Kalmias, azaleas, and asters, the former\r\nvernal, the latter autumnal; solidagos and asters are the most\r\ncharacteristic plants of this region.\r\n\r\nThe splendour of the North American flora is displayed in the United\r\nStates; the American sycamore, chestnut, black walnut, hickory, white\r\ncedar, wild cherry, red birch, locust-tree, tulip-tree, or Liriodendron,\r\nthe glory of American forests, liquid-ambar, oak, ash, pine-trees of\r\nmany species, grow luxuriantly, with an undergrowth of rhododendrons,\r\nazaleas, Andromedas, Gerardias, Calycanthus, Hydrangea, and many more of\r\nwoody texture, with an infinite variety of herbaceous and climbing\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation is different on the two sides of the Alleghany mountains;\r\nthe locust-tree, Canadian poplar, Hibiscus, and Hydrangea, are most\r\ncommon on the west side; the American chestnut and Kalmias are so\r\nnumerous on the Atlantic side as to give a distinctive character to the\r\nflora: here, too, aquatic plants are more frequent; among these the\r\nSarracenia or side-saddle flower, singular in form, with leaves like\r\npitchers covered with a lid, half full of water.\r\n\r\nThe autumnal tints of the forests in the middle States are beautiful and\r\nof endless variety; the dark leaves of the evergreen pine, the red\r\nfoliage of the maple, the yellow beech, the scarlet oak, and purple\r\nNyssa, with all their intermediate tints, ever changing with the light\r\nand distance, produce an effect at sunset that would astonish the native\r\nof a country with a more sober-coloured flora under a more cloudy sky.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, Kentucky, and the southern States, the vegetation assumes a\r\ndifferent aspect, though many plants of more northern districts are\r\nmixed with it. Trees and shrubs here are remarkable for broad shining\r\nleaves and splendid blossoms, as the Gleditschia, Catalpa, Hibiscus, and\r\nall the family of Magnolias, which are natives of the country, excepting\r\na very few found in Asia and the Indian islands. They are the\r\ndistinguishing feature of the flora from Virginia to the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nand from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains: the Magnolia grandiflora\r\nand the tulip-tree are the most splendid specimens of this race of\r\nplants; the latter is often 120 feet high. The long-leaved pitch-pine,\r\none of the most picturesque of trees, covers an arid soil on the coast\r\nof the Atlantic of 60,000 square miles. The swamps so common in the\r\nsouthern States are clothed with gigantic deciduous cypress, the aquatic\r\noak, swamp hickory, with the magnificent Nelumbium luteum and other\r\naquatics, and among the innumerable herbaceous plants the singular\r\nDionæa muscipula, or American fly-trap: the trap is formed by two\r\nopposite lobes of the leaf, covered with spines, and so irritable, that\r\nthey instantly close upon the insect that has come to light upon them.\r\nThis Magnolia region corresponds in latitude with the southern shores of\r\nthe Mediterranean, but the climate is hotter and more humid, in\r\nconsequence of which there is a considerable number of Mexican plants. A\r\nfew dwarf-palms appear among the Magnolias, and the forests in Florida\r\nand Alabama are covered with Tillandsia usneoides, an air-plant, which\r\nhangs from the boughs.[164]\r\n\r\nTen or twelve species of grass cover the extensive prairies or steppes\r\nof the valley of the Mississippi. The forms of the Tartarian steppes\r\nappear to the north in the Centaurea, Artemisia, Astragali; but the\r\nDahlias, Œnotheras, with many more, are their own. The Helianthus and\r\nCoreopsis, mixed with some European genera, mark the middle regions; and\r\nin the south, towards the Rocky Mountains, Clarkia and Bartonia are\r\nmixed with the Mexican genera of Cactus and Yucca. The western forest is\r\nless extensive and less varied than the eastern, but the trees are\r\nlarger. This flora in high latitudes is but little known; the Thuia\r\ngigantea on the Rocky Mountains and the coast of the Pacific is 200 feet\r\nhigh. Claytonias and currants, with plants of northern Asia, are found\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nFarther west, the Pinus Lambertiana is another specimen of the\r\nstupendous trees of this flora; seven species of pine are indigenous in\r\nCalifornia, some of which have measured 200, and even 300 feet high, and\r\n80 in circumference. Captain Sir Edward Belcher, in his “Voyage on the\r\nPacific,” mentions having measured an oak 27 feet in circumference, and\r\nanother 18 feet girth at the height of 60 feet from the ground, before\r\nthe branches began to spread. This is the native soil of the\r\ncurrant-bushes with red and yellow blossoms, of many varieties of\r\nlupins, pæonies, poppies, and other herbaceous plants so ornamental in\r\nour gardens.\r\n\r\nThere are 332 genera of plants peculiar to North America, exclusive of\r\nMexico, but no family of any great extent has yet been discovered there.\r\nAbout 160 large trees yield excellent timber; the wood of the pine-trees\r\nof the eastern forests is of inferior quality to that grown on the other\r\nside of the continent, and both appear to be less valuable than the\r\npine-wood of Europe, which is best when produced in a cold climate. The\r\nPinus Cembra and the Pinus uncinata are the most esteemed of the Old\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nThe native fruits of North America are mostly of the nut-kind, and there\r\nare many of these, to which may be added the Florida orange, the Chicasa\r\nplum, the papaw, the banana, the red mulberry, and the plumlike fruit of\r\nthe persimon. There are seven species of wild grapes, but good wine has\r\nnot hitherto been produced. Although America has contributed so much to\r\nthe ornament of our pleasure-grounds and gardens, yet there are\r\ncomparatively few North American plants which have become an object of\r\nextensive cultivation, while America has borrowed largely from other\r\nparts of the globe; the grapes cultivated in North America are European;\r\ntobacco, Indian corn, and many others of the utmost commercial value are\r\nstrangers to the soil, having been introduced by the earliest\r\ninhabitants from Mexico and South America, which have contributed much\r\nmore to general utility.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  FLORA OF MEXICO AND THE WEST INDIES.\r\n\r\nMexico itself unites the vegetation of North and South America, though\r\nit resembles that of the latter more nearly. Whole provinces on the\r\ntable-land and mountains produce alpine plants, oaks, chestnuts, and\r\npines spontaneously. The Cheirostemon, or hand-tree, so named from the\r\nresemblance its stigma bears to the human hand, grows here, and also in\r\nthe Guatemala forests.\r\n\r\nThe low lands of Mexico and Central America have a very rich flora,\r\nconsisting of many orders and genera peculiar to them, and species\r\nwithout number, a great portion of which are unknown. The Hymenea\r\nCourbaril, from which the copal of Mexico is obtained, logwood,\r\nmahogany, and many other large trees, valuable for their timber, grow in\r\nthe forests; sugar-cane, tobacco, indigo, American aloe, yam, capsicum,\r\nand yucca, are indigenous in Mexico and Central America. It is the\r\nnative region of the Melastomas, of which 620 species are known; almost\r\nall the pepper tribe, the Passifloræ, the ornament and pride of tropical\r\nAmerica and the West Indian islands, begin to be numerous in these\r\nregions. The pine-apple is entirely American, growing in the woods and\r\nsavannahs: it has been carried to the West Indies, to the East Indies\r\nand China, and is naturalized in all. This country has also produced the\r\ncherimoya, said to be the most exquisite of fruits. All the vanilla that\r\nis used in Europe comes from the States of Vera Cruz and Oaxaca, on the\r\neastern slopes of the Cordillera of Anahuac in Mexico. It is native\r\nthroughout tropical America, growing in hot, damp, shady places. Hot\r\narid tracts are covered with the Cactus tribe, a family of Central\r\nAmerica and Mexico, which is more widely dispersed than the anana: some\r\nspecies bear a considerable degree of cold. They are social plants,\r\ninhabiting sandy plains in thickets, and of many species: their forms\r\nare various, and their blossoms beautiful. A few occur at a considerable\r\ndistance from the tropics, to the north and the south. The\r\nnight-flowering Cereus grows in all its beauty in the arid parts of\r\nChile, filling the night air with its perfume. The Cactus opuntia grows\r\nin the Rocky Mountains; and Sir George Back found a small island in the\r\nLake of the Woods covered with it. This species has been brought to\r\nEurope, and now grows a common weed on the borders of the Mediterranean.\r\nIn Mexico, the cochineal insect was collected from the Cactus\r\ncoccinellifer long before the Spanish conquest. There are large fields\r\nof American aloe, from which a liquor called pulque, and also an ardent\r\nspirit, are made. The ancient Mexicans made their hemp from this plant,\r\nand also their paper. The forests of Panama contain at least 97\r\ndifferent kinds of trees, which grow luxuriantly in a climate where the\r\ntorrents of rain are so favourable to vegetation, and so unfavourable to\r\nlife that the tainted air is deadly even to animals.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-cane is a native of both continents; Columbus found it wild in\r\nmany parts of America: the sweet cane is mentioned by the Prophets, and\r\nit has grown time immemorial on the coasts of China and in the islands\r\nof the Pacific. Its culture ranges throughout the torrid zone, and to\r\nlatitudes where the mean temperature is not under 64° of Fahrenheit. It\r\ngrows on the plains of Nepaul at an absolute elevation of 4800 feet, and\r\nat the height of from 3500 to 5100 feet in the Cordillera of New\r\nGrenada. It is now scarcely cultivated in the southern provinces of New\r\nSpain, where it was introduced by the Spaniards, but it is extensively\r\nraised in Guiana, Brazil, the West India islands, the Mauritius,\r\nBourbon, Bengal, Siam, Java, the Philippine islands, and China.\r\n\r\nMaize or Indian corn is believed to have come originally from Mexico and\r\nSouth America. It is an annual, requiring only summer heat; its limit is\r\n50° N. in the American continent, and 47° N. in Europe; it ripens at an\r\nelevation of 7600 feet in low latitudes, and in the Lower Pyrenees at\r\nthe height of 3289 feet.[165]\r\n\r\nThe flora of each West Indian island is similar to that of the continent\r\nopposite to it. The Myrtus pimento, producing allspice, is common in the\r\nhills; custard-apple, guava, the avocado pear, and tobacco, are\r\nindigenous; the cabbage-palm grows to the height of 150 feet; the\r\npalma-real of Cuba is the most majestic of that noble family; and in\r\nBarbadoes there still exists a tree, but wearing out rapidly, which has\r\ngiven the island its name.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       FLORA OF TROPICAL AMERICA.\r\n\r\nAlthough the flora of tropical America is better explored than that of\r\nAsia or Africa, there must still be thousands of plants of which we have\r\nno knowledge; and those which have come under observation are so varied\r\nand so numerous, that it is not possible to convey an idea of the\r\npeculiarities of this vegetation, or of the extent and richness of its\r\nwoodlands. The upper Orinoco flows for some hundred miles chiefly\r\nthrough forests; and the silvas of the Amazons are six times the size of\r\nFrance. In these the trees are colossal, and the vegetation so matted\r\ntogether by underwood, creeping and parasitical plants, that the sun’s\r\nrays can scarcely penetrate the dense foliage.\r\n\r\nThese extensive forests are by no means uniform; they differ on each\r\nside of the equator, though climate and other circumstances are the\r\nsame. Venezuela, Guiana, the Amazona, and Brazil, are each the centre of\r\na peculiar flora. So partial is this splendid vegetation, that almost\r\neach tributary of the great rivers has a flora of its own: particular\r\nfamilies of plants are so restricted in their localities, and\r\npredominate so exclusively where they occur, that they change the\r\nappearance of the forest. Thus, from the prevalence of the orders\r\nLaurineæ, Sapotaceæ, and others, which have leathery, shining, and\r\nentire leaves, the forests through which the Rio Negro, Cassiquiare, and\r\nTuamine flow, differ in aspect from those of the other affluents of the\r\nAmazons. Even the grassy llanos, so uniform in appearance, have their\r\ncentres of vegetation; and only agree with the pampas of Buenos Ayres in\r\nbeing covered with grass and herbs. In these tropical regions the flora\r\nvaries with the altitude also. On the Andes, almost at the limit of\r\nvegetation, the ground is covered with purple, azure, and scarlet\r\ngentians, drabas, alchemillas, and many other brilliantly-coloured\r\nalpine plants. This zone is followed by thickets of coriaceous-leaved\r\nplants, in perpetual bloom and verdure; and then come the forest-trees.\r\nArborescent ferns ascend to 7000 feet; the coffee-tree and palms to\r\n5000; and neither indigo nor cocoa can be cultivated lower than 2000.\r\nThe tree yielding cocoa, of which chocolate is made, grows wild in\r\nGuiana, Mexico, and on the coast of the Caraccas; it is now cultivated\r\nin Central and South America, even to Chile, also in the Canary and\r\nPhilippine islands, into which it was introduced by the Spaniards. The\r\nseeds of its fruit, which is like a cucumber, are the cocoa.\r\n\r\nMany parts of the coasts of Venezuela and Guiana are rendered\r\npestilential by the effluvia of the mangrove, Avicennia, and the\r\nmanchineel, one of the Euphorbia family, consisting of 562 species in\r\ntropical America, all having milky juice, deleterious in the greater\r\nnumber. The well-known poison Ourari is prepared by the Indians of\r\nGuiana from the fruit and bark of the Strychnos toxicaria, than which\r\nnature has probably produced no plants more deadly. This Ourari (or\r\nWourali) is a creeping plant which yields the deadly juice, the powerful\r\neffect of which was proved by Mr. Waterton’s experiments.\r\n\r\nThe Cinchona, or true bark-tree, grows only on the Cordilleras of the\r\nAndes.[166] Some of its medicinal qualities are found in other plants of\r\ndifferent genera in Guiana, as the Cusparia carony, which produces the\r\nAngostura bark. The Sapindus saponaria, or soap-tree, is used by the\r\nnatives for washing. Capsicum, vanilla, the incense-plant, the Dipteryx\r\nodorata, whose fruit is the tonquin-bean, and the cassava or mandioc,\r\nare natives of the country. There are two kinds of mandioc, a shrub\r\nwhose fleshy roots yield a farina eaten by the natives of Spanish\r\nAmerica and Brazil: the root of one is harmless, but the other contains\r\na poisonous milky juice, the effects of which are removed by cultivation\r\nor pressure. It grows to about 30° on each side of the equator, and to\r\n3200 feet above the sea-level. An acre of mandioc is said to yield as\r\nmuch nourishment as six acres of wheat.\r\n\r\nArrow-root is native in South America; it has been transported to the\r\nWest Indies and Ceylon. The flour is the produce of the root. The plant\r\nis said to owe its name to the belief of its being an antidote to the\r\npoison of the arrows of the Indians. The cow-tree, almost confined to\r\nthe Cordillera of the coast of Venezuela, yields such abundance of\r\nnutritious milky juice that it is carried in gourds, like milk from the\r\ncow. The chocolate-plant, or cacao-shrub, fruits of the most excellent\r\nflavour, plants yielding balsam, resin, and gum, are numerous in the\r\ntropical regions. There the laurel tribe assume the character of\r\nmajestic trees: some are so rich in oil, that it gushes from a wound in\r\nthe bark. One of these laurels produces the essential oil which\r\ndissolves caoutchouc, or Indian rubber, used in rendering cloth\r\nwaterproof.\r\n\r\nPlantains of gigantic size form large forests; but palms are the most\r\nnumerous and the most beautiful of all the trees in these countries.\r\nThere are 90 species of them; and they are so local that a change takes\r\nplace every 50 miles. They are the greatest ornament of the upper\r\nOrinoco.\r\n\r\nThe llanos of Venezuela and Guiana are covered with tall grass, mixed\r\nwith lilies and other bulbous flowers, sensitive mimosas, and palms\r\nconstantly varying in species.\r\n\r\nNo language can describe the glory of the forests of the Amazon and\r\nBrazil, the endless variety of form, the contrasts of colour and size:\r\nthere even the largest trees bear brilliant blossoms; scarlet, purple,\r\nblue, rose-colour, and golden yellow, are blended with every possible\r\nshade of green. Majestic trees, as the Bombax ceiba (or silk-cotton\r\ntree), the dark-leaved mora with its white blossoms, the fig, cashew,\r\nand mimosa tribes, which are here of unwonted dimensions, and a thousand\r\nother giants of the forest, are contrasted with the graceful palm, the\r\ndelicate Acacia, reeds of 100 feet high, grasses of 40, and tree-ferns\r\nin myriads. Passifloræ and slender creepers twine round the lower\r\nplants, while others as thick as cables climb the lofty trees, drop\r\nagain to the ground, rise anew and stretch from bough to bough, wreathed\r\nwith their own leaves and flowers, yet intermixed with the vividly\r\ncoloured blossoms of the Orchideæ. An impenetrable and everlasting\r\nvegetation covers the ground; decay and death are concealed by the\r\nexuberance of life; the trees are loaded with parasites while alive—they\r\nbecome masses of living plants when they die.\r\n\r\nOne twenty-ninth part of the flowering plants of the Brazilian forests\r\nare of the coffee-tribe, and the rose-coloured and yellow-flowering\r\nbignonias are among their greatest ornaments, where all is grace and\r\nbeauty. Thousands of herbs and trees must still be undescribed where\r\neach stream has its own vegetation. The palm-trees are the glory of the\r\nforest: 81 species of these plants are natives of the intertropical\r\nparts of Brazil alone; they are of all sizes, from such as have hardly\r\nany stem to those that rise 130 feet.[167] In those parts of Brazil less\r\nfavoured by nature, the forests consist of stunted deciduous trees, and\r\nthe boundless plains have grasses, interspersed with myrtles and other\r\nshrubs.[168]\r\n\r\nThe forests on the banks of the Paraguay and Vermejo are almost as rich\r\nas those of the tropics. Noble trees furnish timber and fruit; the\r\nalgaroba, a kind of acacia, produces clusters of a bean, of which the\r\nIndians make bread, and also a strong fermented liquor; the palm and\r\ncinchona grow there; and the yerba-maté, the leaves of which are\r\nuniversally used as tea in South America, and were in use before the\r\nSpanish conquest. It is a species of holly, with leaves five or six\r\ninches long.\r\n\r\nThe sandy deserts towards the mountains are the land of the Agave and\r\nCactus in all their varieties. The fibres of the Agave are made into\r\ncordage by the Indians for fishing-nets and other uses, and the juice\r\naffords them drink. Some larger species of Cactus give a light and\r\ndurable wood; and the Cochineal insect, which feeds on them, is a\r\nvaluable article of commerce.\r\n\r\nGrass, clover, and European and African thistles, which have been\r\nintroduced, with a solitary Ombu at wide intervals, are the unvarying\r\nfeatures of the pampas; and thorny stunted bushes, characteristic of all\r\ndeserts, are the only vegetation of the Patagonian shingle. But on the\r\nmountain valleys in the far south may be seen the winter’s bark,\r\narbutus, new species of beech-trees, stunted berberries, and\r\nMisodendron, which latter is a singular kind of parasitical plant.\r\n\r\nLarge forests of Araucaria imbricata grow in the Andes of Chile and\r\nPatagonia. This tall and handsome pine, with cones the size of a child’s\r\nhead, supplies the natives with a great part of their food. It is said\r\nthat the fruit of one large tree will maintain eighteen persons for a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nNothing grows under these great forests; and when accidentally burnt\r\ndown in the mountainous parts of Patagonia, they never rise again, but\r\nthe ground they grew on is soon covered with an impenetrable brushwood\r\nof other plants. In Chile the violently stinging Loasa appears first in\r\nthese burnt places, bushes grow afterwards, and then comes a tree-grass,\r\n18 feet high, of which the Indians make their huts. The new vegetation\r\nthat follows the burning of primeval forests is quite unaccountable. The\r\nancient and undisturbed forests of Pennsylvania have no undergrowth, and\r\nwhen burnt down they are succeeded by a thick growth of rhododendrons.\r\n\r\nThe southern coasts of Chile are very barren, and all plants existing\r\nthere, even the herbaceous, have a tendency to assume a hard knotty\r\ntexture. The stem of the wild potato, which is indigenous in Chile and\r\nPeru, becomes woody and bristly as it grows old. It is a native of the\r\nsea-strand, and is never found naturally more than 400 feet above it. In\r\nits wild state the root is small and bitter; it is one of many instances\r\nof the influence of cultivation in rendering unpromising plants useful\r\nto man.\r\n\r\nIt was cultivated in America at the time of its discovery, and is so\r\nnow, at the height of from 9800 to 13,000 feet above the sea on the\r\nAndes, and as high as 4800 feet on the Swiss Alps; it does not succeed\r\non the plains in hot countries, nor farther north than Iceland. It had\r\nbeen introduced into Europe by the Spaniards before the time of Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh; he brought it to England from Virginia in 1586.\r\n\r\nCoca, the Erythroxylon Coca of botanists, is a native of the tropical\r\nvalleys on the eastern declivity of the Andes of Peru and Bolivia, where\r\nit is extensively cultivated for its leaf, of which the tree furnishes 3\r\nor 4 crops annually; the coca-leaf, which possesses nutritive and\r\nnarcotic qualities, is chewed by the aborigines mixed with an alcaline\r\nsubstance: it allays hunger, and enables the Indian to undergo great\r\nfatigue without any other nourishment for days together; it is an\r\narticle of great trade, and absolutely indispensable in the more\r\nlaborious profession of the miner.\r\n\r\nBetween the southern parallels of 38° and 45° Chile is covered with\r\nextensive forests. Stately trees of many kinds, having smooth and\r\nbrightly-coloured trunks, are bound together by parasitical plants of\r\nthe monocotyledonous structure; large and elegant ferns are numerous,\r\nand arborescent grasses entwine the trees to the height of 20 or 30\r\nfeet; palm-trees grow to the 37th parallel of latitude, their southern\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\nAlthough the flora, at an elevation of 9000 feet on the Chilian Andes,\r\nis almost identical with that of the Straits of Magellan, yet the\r\nclimate is so mild in some valleys, especially that of Antuco, that the\r\nvegetation is semi-tropical. In it broad-leaved and bright-coloured\r\nplants, and the most fragrant and brilliant Orchideæ, are mixed with the\r\nusual alpine genera. Dr. Pœppig says, that whatever South Africa or New\r\nHolland can boast of in beauty, in variety of form, or brilliancy of\r\ncolour, is rivalled by the flora in the highest zone in this part of the\r\nAndes, even up to the region of perpetual snow; and, indeed, it bears a\r\nstrong analogy to the vegetation of both these countries.\r\n\r\nThe Andes so completely check the migration of plants, that almost\r\nthroughout their whole length there is no mingling of the floras on\r\ntheir east and west sides, except at the Isthmus of Panama, where the\r\nmahogany-tree crosses from the Atlantic to the Pacific side, and in the\r\nsame way many of the plants on the lands on the east are brought to the\r\nwest, and spread to California on one side, and as far as the dry plains\r\nof Peru on the other.[169]\r\n\r\nThe humidity or dryness of the prevailing winds makes an immense\r\ndifference in the character of the countries on each side of the Andes.\r\nWithin the southern tropic the trade-winds come loaded with vapour from\r\nthe Atlantic, which is partly precipitated by the mountains of Brazil,\r\nand supplies the noble forests of that country with never ceasing\r\nmoisture, while the remainder is condensed by the Andes, so that on\r\ntheir eastern side there is an exuberant vegetation, while on the\r\nwestern declivities and in the space which separates them from the\r\nPacific they are almost barren, and on the plains and in the valleys of\r\nPeru, where rain very seldom falls, completely so, except where\r\nartificial irrigation is employed. Even on the eastern side of these\r\nmountains the richness of the vegetation gradually disappears with the\r\nincreasing height, till at an elevation of about 15,000 feet arborescent\r\nplants vanish, and alpine races, of the most vivid beauty, succeed;\r\nwhich, in their turn, give place to the grasses at the height of 16,138\r\nfeet. Above these, in the dreary plains of Bombon, and other lands of\r\nthe same altitude, even the thinly-scattered mosses are sickly; and at\r\nthe height of 21,878 feet the snow-lichen forms the last show of\r\nvegetable life; confirming the observation of Don Ulloa, that the\r\nproduce of the soil is the thermometer of Peru.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ANTARCTIC FLORA.\r\n\r\nTierra del Fuego and Kerguelen’s Land are the northern boundary of the\r\nantarctic lands, which are scattered round the south pole at immense\r\ndistances from one another. On these the vegetation decreases as the\r\nlatitude increases, till at length utter desolation prevails; not a\r\nlichen covers the dreary storm-beaten rocks; and, with the exception of\r\na microscopic marine plant, not a sea-weed lives in the gelid waves. In\r\nthe arctic regions, on the contrary, no land has yet been discovered\r\nthat is entirely destitute of vegetable life. This remarkable difference\r\ndoes not so much depend on a greater degree of cold in winter as on the\r\nwant of warmth in summer. In the high northern latitudes the power of\r\nthe summer sun is so great as to melt the pitch between the planks of\r\nthe vessels; while, in corresponding southern latitudes, Fahrenheit’s\r\nthermometer does not rise above 14° at noon at a season corresponding to\r\nour August. The perpetual snow comes to a much lower latitude in the\r\nsouthern lands than it does in the north. Sandwich Land, in a latitude\r\ncorresponding to that of the north of Scotland, is perpetually covered\r\nwith many fathoms of snow. A single species of grass, the Aira\r\nantarctica, is the only flowering plant in the South Shetland islands,\r\nwhich are no less ice-bound; and Cockburn Island, one of that group, in\r\nthe 60th parallel, contains the last vestiges of vegetation; while the\r\nNamesake islands, in an equally high latitude, to the north of Scotland,\r\nare inhabited and cultivated; nay, South Georgia, in a latitude similar\r\nto that of Yorkshire, is always clad in frozen snow, and only produces\r\nsome mosses, lichens, and wild burnet; while Iceland, 10 degrees nearer\r\nthe pole, has 870 species, more than half of which are flower-bearing.\r\n\r\nThe forest-covered islands of Tierra del Fuego are only 360 miles from\r\nthe desolate Shetland group. Such is the difference that a few degrees\r\nof latitude can produce in these antarctic regions, combined with an\r\nequable climate and excessive humidity. The prevalence of evergreen\r\nplants is the most characteristic feature in the Fuegian flora. Densely\r\nentangled forests of winter’s bark, and two species of beech-trees, grow\r\nfrom the shore to a considerable height on the mountains. Of these, the\r\nFagus betuloides, which never loses its brownish-green leaves, prevails\r\nalmost to the exclusion of the evergreen winter’s bark and the deciduous\r\nbeech, which is very beautiful. There are dwarf species of Arbutus, the\r\nMyrtus nummularia, which is used instead of tea, besides berberry,\r\ncurrant, and fuchsia; peculiar species of Ranunculi, calceolarias,\r\nCaryophylleæ, cruciform plants, and violets. Wild celery and\r\nscurvy-grass are the only edible plants; and a bright yellow fungus,\r\nwhich grows on the beech-trees, forms a great part of the food of the\r\nnatives. There is a greater number of plants in Tierra del Fuego, either\r\nidentical with those in Great Britain, or representatives of them, than\r\nexists in any other country in the southern hemisphere. The sea-pink, or\r\nthrift, the common sloewort, a primula farinosa, and at least 30 other\r\nflowering plants, with almost all the lichens, 48 mosses, and many other\r\nplants of the cryptogamous kinds, are identically the same; while the\r\nnumber of genera common to both countries is still greater, and, though\r\nunknown in the intermediate latitudes, reappear here. Hermite Island,\r\nwest from Cape Horn, is a forest-land, covered with winter’s bark and\r\nthe Fuegian beeches; and is the most southern spot on earth on which\r\narborescent vegetation is found. An alpine flora, many of the species of\r\nEuropean genera, grows on the mountains, succeeded higher up by mosses\r\nand lichens. Mosses are exceedingly plentiful throughout Fuegia; but\r\nthey abound in Hermite Island more than in any other country, and are of\r\nsingular and beautiful kinds.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Falkland Islands are in a lower latitude than Tierra del\r\nFuego, not a tree is to be seen. The Veronica elliptica, resembling a\r\nmyrtle, which is extremely rare, and confined to West Falkland, is the\r\nonly large shrub; a white-flowering plant like the aster, about four\r\nfeet high, is common; while a bramble, a crowberry, and a myrtle,\r\nbearing no resemblance, however, to the European species, trail on the\r\nground, and afford edible fruit. The balsam bog, or Bolax globaria, and\r\ngrasses, form the only conspicuous feature in the botany of these\r\nislands; and, together with rushes and Dactylis cæspitosa, or Tussack\r\ngrass, cover them, almost to the exclusion of other plants. The Bolax\r\ngrows in tufted hemispherical masses, of a yellow-green colour, and very\r\nfirm substance, often four feet high, and as many in diameter, from\r\nwhence a strong-smelling resinous substance exudes, perceptible at a\r\ndistance. This plant has umbelliferous flowers, and belongs to the\r\ncarrot order, but forms an antarctic genus quite peculiar.\r\n\r\nThe Tussack grass is the most useful and the most singular plant in this\r\nflora. It covers all the small islands of the group, like a forest of\r\nminiature palm-trees, and thrives best on the shores exposed to the\r\nspray of the sea. Each tussack is an isolated plant, occupying about two\r\nsquare yards of ground. It forms a hillock of matted roots, rising\r\nstraight and solitary out of the soil, often six feet high and four or\r\nfive in diameter; from the top of which it throws out a thick grassy\r\nfoliage of blades, six feet long, drooping on all sides, and forming,\r\nwith the leaves of the adjacent plants, an arch over the ground beneath,\r\nwhich yields shelter to sea-lions, penguins, and petrels. Cattle are\r\nexceedingly fond of this grass, which yields annually a much greater\r\nsupply of excellent fodder than the same extent of ground would do\r\neither of common grass or clover. Both the Tussack-grass and the Bolax\r\nare found, though sparingly, in Tierra del Fuego; indeed, the vegetation\r\nof the Falkland Islands consists chiefly of the mountain plants of that\r\ncountry, and of those that grow on the arid plains of Patagonia; but it\r\nis kept close to the ground by the fierceness of the terrific gales that\r\nsweep over these antarctic islands. Peculiar species of European genera\r\nare found here, as a calceolaria, wood sorrel, and a yellow violet;\r\nwhile the shepherd’s purse, cardamine hirsuta, and the primula farinosa,\r\nappear to be identical with those at home. In all, there are scarcely\r\n120 flowering plants, including grasses. Ferns and mosses are few, but\r\nlichens are in great variety and abundance, among which many are\r\nidentical with those in Britain.\r\n\r\nIn the same hemisphere, far, far removed from the Falkland group, the\r\nAuckland Islands lie in the boisterous ocean south of New Zealand. They\r\nare covered with dense and all but impenetrable thickets of stunted\r\ntrees, or rather shrubs, about 20 or 30 feet high, gnarled by gales from\r\na stormy sea. There is nothing analogous to these shrubs in the northern\r\nhemisphere; but the Veronica elliptica, a native of Tierra del Fuego and\r\nNew Zealand, is one of them. Fifteen species of ferns find shelter under\r\nthese trees, and their fallen trunks are covered with mosses and\r\nlichens. Eighty flowering plants were found during the stay of the\r\ndiscovery ships, of which 56 are new; and half of the whole number are\r\npeculiar to this group and to Campbell’s Island. Some of the most\r\nbeautiful flowers grow on the mountains, others are mixed with the ferns\r\nin the forests. A beautiful plant was discovered, like a purple aster, a\r\nVeronica, with large spikes of ultramarine colour; a white one, with a\r\nperfume like jessamine; a sweet-smelling alpine Hierochloe; and in some\r\nof the valleys the fragrant and bright-yellow blossoms of a species of\r\nasphodel were so abundant that the ground looked like a carpet of gold.\r\nA singular plant grows on the sea-shore, having bunches of green waxy\r\nblossoms the size of a child’s head. There are also antarctic species of\r\nEuropean genera, as beautiful red and white gentians, geraniums, &c. The\r\nvegetation is characterized by an exuberance of the finer flowering\r\nplants, and an absence of grasses and sedges; but the landscape, though\r\npicturesque, has a sombre aspect, from the prevalence of brownish-leaved\r\nplants of the myrtle tribe.\r\n\r\nCampbell’s Island lies 120 miles to the south of the Auckland group, and\r\nis much smaller, but from the more varied form of its surface it is\r\nsupposed to produce as many species of plants. During the two days the\r\ndiscovery ships, under the command of Sir James Ross, remained there,\r\nbetween 200 and 300 were collected, of which 66 were flowering plants,\r\n14 of which were peculiar to the country. Many of the Auckland Island\r\nplants were found here, yet a great change had taken place; 34 species\r\nhad disappeared and were replaced by 20 new, all peculiar to Campbell’s\r\nIsland alone, and some were found that hitherto had been supposed to\r\nbelong to Antarctic America only. In the Auckland group only one-seventh\r\nof the plants are common to other Antarctic lands, whilst in Campbell’s\r\nIsland a fourth are natives of other longitudes in the Antarctic Ocean.\r\nThe flora of Campbell’s Island and the Auckland group is so intimately\r\nallied to that of New Zealand, that it may be regarded as the\r\ncontinuation of the latter, under an Antarctic character, though\r\ndestitute of the beech and pine trees. There is a considerable number of\r\nFuegian plants in the islands under consideration, though 4000 miles\r\ndistant; and whenever their flora differs in the smaller plants from\r\nthat of New Zealand, it approximates to that of Antarctic America: but\r\nthe trees and shrubs are entirely dissimilar. The relation between this\r\nvegetation and that of the northern regions is but slight. The Auckland\r\ngroup and Campbell’s Island are in a latitude corresponding to that of\r\nEngland, yet only three indigenous plants of our island have been found\r\nin them, namely, the Cardamine hirsuta, Montia, and Callitriche. This is\r\nthe utmost southern limit of tree-ferns.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no spot in either hemisphere, at the same distance from the\r\npole, is more barren than Kerguelen Islands, lying in a remote part of\r\nthe south polar ocean. Only 18 species of flowering plants were found\r\nthere, which is less than the number in Melville Island, in the Arctic\r\nSeas, and three times less than the number even in Spitzbergen. The\r\nwhole known vegetation of these islands only amounts to 150, including\r\nsea-weeds. The Pringlea, a kind of cabbage, acceptable to those who have\r\nbeen long at sea, is peculiar to the island, and grass, together with a\r\nplant similar to the Bolax of the Falkland Islands, covers large tracts.\r\nAbout 20 mosses, lichens, &c., are only found in these islands, but many\r\nof the others are also native in the European Alps and north polar\r\nregions. It is a very remarkable circumstance in the distribution of\r\nplants, that there should be so much analogy between the floras of\r\nplaces so far apart as Kerguelen Islands, the groups south from New\r\nZealand, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, and Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ORIGIN AND DISTRIBUTION OF CEREALIA.\r\n\r\nThe plants which the earth produces spontaneously are thus confined\r\nwithin certain districts, and few of them would survive a change of\r\ncircumstances; nevertheless, Providence has endowed those most essential\r\nto man with a greater flexibility of structure, so that the limits of\r\ntheir production can be extended by culture beyond what have been\r\nassigned to them by nature. The grasses yielding the grains are\r\nespecially favoured in this respect, though their extension depends upon\r\nthe knowledge and industry of man; no grain will be cultivated where it\r\ncan be procured from a foreign market at less expense; so that with\r\nregard to useful plants there is an artificial as well as a natural\r\nboundary. The cultivation of plants in gardens and hot-houses is\r\nentirely artificial, and depends on luxury and fashion.\r\n\r\nTartary and Persia are presumed to have been the original countries of\r\nwheat, rye, and oats; but these grains have been so long in use that it\r\nis impossible to trace their origin with certainty. Barley grows\r\nspontaneously in Tartary and Sicily, probably of different species.\r\nThose plants which produce the grains must have had a more extended\r\nlocation than any other, and they can endure the greatest extremes of\r\nheat and cold. In high northern latitudes wheat is protected from the\r\ninclemency of winter by sowing it in spring, or if sown in autumn a\r\ncoating of snow defends it: the polar limit is the isothermal line of\r\n57° 2ʹ, and wheat will not form seed within less than 20° or 23° of the\r\nequator. In America the northern limit is unknown, the country being\r\nuninhabited; but at Cumberland House, in the very middle of the\r\ncontinent, one of the stations of the Hudson’s Bay Company, in 54° N.\r\nlat., there are fields of wheat, barley, and maize. Wheat thrives\r\nluxuriantly in Chile and Rio de la Plata, and at elevations of 8500 and\r\n10,000 feet above the sea. It even produces grain on the banks of the\r\nLake Titicaca in the Peru-Bolivian Andes at the absolute height of\r\n12,795 feet in sheltered situations, and good crops of barley are raised\r\nin that elevated region.\r\n\r\nBarley bears cold better than any of the grains, yet neither it nor any\r\nother will grow in Iceland. It is successfully cultivated in the Feroe\r\nIslands, near Cape North, the extreme point of Norway, near Archangel on\r\nthe White Sea, and in Central Siberia to between 58° and 59° N. lat.\r\n\r\nRye is only cultivated where the soil is very poor, and agriculture\r\nlittle understood, yet a third of the population of Europe lives on\r\nrye-bread, chiefly inhabitants of the middle and especially of the\r\nnorthern parts; its limit is about the 67th parallel of N. latitude.\r\n\r\nOats are scarcely known in middle and southern Europe; in the north they\r\nare extensively cultivated to the 65th degree of N. latitude.\r\n\r\nRice is the food of a greater number of human beings than any other\r\ngrain; it has been cultivated from such high antiquity that all traces\r\nof its origin are lost. It contains a greater proportion of nutritious\r\nmatter than any of the Cerealia, but, since it requires excessive\r\nmoisture, and a temperature of 73° 4ʹ at least, its cultivation is\r\nlimited to countries between the equator and the 45th parallel.\r\n\r\nIndian corn and millet are much cultivated in Europe south of the 45th\r\nand 47th parallels, and form an important article of food in France,\r\nItaly, Africa, India, and America. Buck-wheat is extensively cultivated\r\nin northern Europe and Siberia and the table-lands of central Asia; it\r\nis a native of Asia, from whence it was brought into Europe in the 15th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe cerealia afford one of the most remarkable examples of numberless\r\nvarieties arising from the seed of one species. In Ceylon alone there\r\nare 160 varieties of rice, and at least 30 of Panicum. The endless\r\nvarieties which may be raised from the seed of one plant is most\r\nconspicuous in the flower-garden: the rose affords above 1400; the\r\nvarieties of the pansy, calceolaria, tulip, auricula, and primrose are\r\nwithout end, and often differ so much from the parent plant that it\r\nseems almost impossible they should have had a common origin: it seems\r\ndifficult to believe that red cabbage, cauliflower, and many others,\r\nshould have sprung from the sea-kale or Brassica oleracea, so totally\r\ndissimilar from any of them, with its bitter sea-green curly leaves.\r\nFashion changes so much with regard to plants that it is scarcely\r\npossible to form even an approximation to the number known to be in\r\ncultivation; new plants are introduced from a foreign country, and are\r\napt to take the place of some of the older, which are neglected and\r\nsometimes lost; of 120,000 plants which are known to exist on the earth,\r\nnot more than 15,000 are believed to be in cultivation.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that plants capable of bearing a great range of\r\ntemperature would exist through longer geological periods than those\r\nmore limited in their endurance of vicissitudes of temperature, and it\r\nappears that in many instances at least the existence of varieties\r\ndepends on the life of the plant from whence they originated; the actual\r\nduration of individuals is a subject which has not been sufficiently\r\nstudied, though the progress of physiological botany has given the means\r\nof doing so without destroying the plant.\r\n\r\nSince forest-trees increase by coatings from without, the growth of each\r\nyear forming a concentric circle of wood round the pith or centre of the\r\nstem, the age of a tree may be ascertained by counting the number of\r\nrings in a transverse section of the trunk, each ring representing a\r\nyear. Moreover, the progress of the growth is known by comparing the\r\nbreadth of the rings, which are broader in a favourable than in an\r\nunfavourable season, though this may depend also, in some measure, on\r\nthe quality of the soil which the roots have come to in their downward\r\ngrowth. If the number of concentric rings in a transverse section has\r\nshown the age of a tree, and its girth has been ascertained by\r\nmeasurement, an approximation to the age of any other tree of the same\r\nkind still growing, under similar circumstances, maybe determined by\r\ncomparison. In this way the age of many remarkable trees has been\r\nascertained. The yew attains a greater age than any other tree in\r\nEurope. According to M. De Candolle this tree increases in girth the\r\ntwelfth part of an inch in a year during the first 150 years, and rather\r\nless in the next hundred, the increase probably decreasing\r\nprogressively. By that estimate a yew at Fountaine Abbey was reckoned by\r\nPennant to be 1214 years old; one at Crowhurst, in Surrey, was 1400\r\nyears old when measured by Evelyn; it has been shown by the same method\r\nthat a yew at Fotherngill, in Scotland, was between 2500 and 2800 years\r\nold; and one at Braburn, in Kent, must have been 3000 years old: these\r\nare the veterans of European vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe cypress rivals the yew in longevity, and may perhaps surpass it.\r\nThere is a cypress in the palace garden at Grenada which had been\r\ncelebrated in the time of the Moors, and was still known in the year\r\n1776, as Cipres della Regina Sultana, because a sultana met with\r\nAbencerrages under its shade. Oaks come next in order: they are supposed\r\nto live 1500 or 1600 years. One in Welbec Lane, mentioned by Evelyn, was\r\ncomputated to be 1400 years old. Chestnut-trees are known to live 900\r\nyears; lime-trees have attained 500 or 600 years in France; and birches\r\nare supposed to be equally durable. Some of the smaller and less\r\nconspicuous European plants perhaps rival these giants of the forest in\r\nage: heaths, and the alpine willow, which covers the ground with its\r\nleaves, although it is really a subterranean tree spreading to a vast\r\ndistance, are long lived. Ivy is another example of this: there is one\r\nnear Montpellier, six feet in girth, which must be 485 years old. A\r\nlichen was watched for forty years without the appearance of change.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of these European vegetables sinks into insignificance\r\nwhen compared with the celebrated baobab, or Adansonia digitata, in\r\nSenegal: taking as a measure the number of concentric rings counted on a\r\ntransverse incision made for the purpose in the trunk of that enormous\r\ntree, it was proved to be 5150 years old; yet Baron Humboldt considers a\r\ncypress in the garden of Chapultepec to be still older; it had already\r\nreached a great age when Montezuma was on the throne of Mexico, in 1520.\r\nThese two trees are probably the most aged organized beings on the face\r\nof the earth. Eight olive-trees on the Mount of Olives are supposed to\r\nbe 800 years old; it is at least certain that they existed prior to the\r\ntaking of Jerusalem by the Turks. There is some doubt as to the age of\r\nthe largest cedar on Lebanon; it is nine feet in diameter, and has\r\nprobably existed 800 or 900 years. There are two cedar-trees in the\r\nBotanic Garden at Chelsea which were mentioned 600 years ago.\r\n\r\nThe age of palms and other monocotyledonous plants is ascertained by a\r\ncomparison of their height with the time which each kind takes to grow.\r\nM. De Candolle thus estimates that the Cocos oleracea, or cabbage-palms,\r\nmay live 600 or 700 years, while the cocoa-nut palm lives from 80 to 330\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMr. Babbage has made an approximation to the age of peat-mosses from the\r\nconcentric rings of the trees found in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MARINE VEGETATION.\r\n\r\nA vegetable world lies hid beneath the surface of the ocean, altogether\r\nunlike that on land, and existing under circumstances totally different\r\nwith regard to light, heat, and pressure, yet sustained by the same\r\nmeans. Carbonic acid and ammonia are as essential, and metallic oxides\r\nare as indispensable, to marine vegetation as they are to land-plants.\r\nSea-water contains ammonia, and something more than a twelve-thousandth\r\npart of its weight of carbonate of lime, yet that minute portion is\r\nsufficient to supply all the shell-fish and coral-insects in the sea\r\nwith materials for their habitations, as well as food for vegetation.\r\nMarine plants are more expert chemists than we are, for the water of the\r\nocean contains rather less than a millionth part of its weight of\r\niodine, which they collect in quantities impossible for us to obtain\r\notherwise than from their ashes.\r\n\r\nSea-weeds fix their roots to anything—to stone, wood, and to other\r\nsea-weeds: they must, therefore, derive all their nourishment from the\r\nwater, and the air it contains; and the vital force or chemical energy\r\nby which they decompose and assimilate the substances fit for their\r\nmaintenance is the sun’s light.\r\n\r\nMarine plants, which are very numerous, consist of two groups—a jointed\r\nkind, which include the Confervæ, or plants having a thread-like form;\r\nand a jointless kind, to which belong dulse, laver, the kinds used for\r\nmaking kelp, vegetable glue, iodine, that in the Indian Archipelago, of\r\nwhich the sea-swallows make their edible nests, and all the gigantic\r\nspecies which grow in submarine forests, or float like green meadows in\r\nthe open sea. Flower-bearing sea-weeds are very limited in their range,\r\nwhich depends upon the depth of water and the nature of the coasts; but\r\nthe cryptogamic kinds are widely dispersed, some species are even found\r\nin every climate from pole to pole. No doubt the polar currents at the\r\nsurface, and the stratum of uniform temperature lower down, are the\r\nhighways by which these cosmopolites travel.[170]\r\n\r\nThere are fewer vegetable provinces in the seas than on land, because\r\nthe temperature is more uniform, and the dispersion of the plants is not\r\nso much interfered with by the various causes which disturb it on\r\nland.[171]\r\n\r\nMarine vegetation varies both horizontally and vertically with the\r\ndepth, and it seems to be a general law throughout the ocean that the\r\nlight of the sun and vegetation end together; it consequently depends on\r\nthe power of the sun and the transparency of the water; so different\r\nkinds of sea-weeds affect different depths, where the weight of the\r\nwater, the quantity of light and heat, suit them best. One great marine\r\nzone lies between the high and low water marks, and varies in species\r\nwith the nature of the coasts, but exhibits similar phenomena throughout\r\nthe northern hemisphere. In the British seas, where, with two\r\nexceptions, the whole flora is cryptogamic,[172] this zone does not\r\nextend deeper than 30 fathoms, but is divided into two distinct\r\nprovinces, one to the south and another to the north. The former\r\nincludes the southern and eastern coasts of England, the southern and\r\nwestern coasts of Ireland, and both the channels; while the northern\r\nflora is confined to the Scottish seas and the adjacent coasts of\r\nEngland and Ireland. The second British zone begins at low-water mark,\r\nand extends below it to a depth from 7 to 15 fathoms. It contains the\r\ngreat tangle sea-weeds, growing in miniature forests, mixed with fuci,\r\nand is the abode of a host of animals. A coral-like sea-weed is the last\r\nplant of this zone, and the lowest in these seas, where it does not\r\nextend below the depth of 60 fathoms, but in the Mediterranean it is\r\nfound at 70 or 80 fathoms, and is the lowest plant in that sea. The same\r\nlaw prevails in the Bay of Biscay, where one set of sea-weeds is never\r\nfound lower than 20 feet below the surface; another only in the zone\r\nbetween the depths of 5 and 30 feet; and another between 15 and 35 feet.\r\nIn these two last zones they are most numerous; at a greater depth the\r\nkinds continue to vary, but their numbers decrease. The seeds of each\r\nkind float at the depth most genial to the future plant; they must\r\ntherefore be of different weights. The distribution in the Egean Sea was\r\nfound by Professor E. Forbes to be perfectly similar, only that the\r\nvegetation is different, and extends to a greater depth in the\r\nMediterranean than in more northern seas.[173] He also observed that\r\nsea-weeds growing near the surface are more limited in their\r\ndistribution than those that grow lower down, and that with regard to\r\nvegetation depth corresponds with latitude, as height does on land.\r\nThus, the flora at great depths, in warm seas, is represented by kindred\r\nforms in higher latitudes. There is every reason to believe that the\r\nsame laws of distribution prevail throughout the ocean and every sea.\r\n\r\nSea-weeds adhere firmly to the rocks before their fructification, but\r\nthey are easily detached afterwards, which accounts for some of the vast\r\nfields of floating weeds; but others, of gigantic size and wide\r\ndistribution, are supposed to grow unattached in the water itself. There\r\nare permanent bands of sea-weed in our British Channel and in the North\r\nSea, of the kind called Fucus Filum, which grow abundantly on the\r\nwestern coasts of the Channel, and they lie in the direction of the\r\ncurrents, in beds 15 or 20 miles long, and not more than 600 feet wide.\r\nThese bands must oscillate with the tides between two corresponding\r\nzones of rest, one at the turn of the flood, and the other at the turn\r\nof the ebb. It is doubtful whether the Fucus natans or Sargassum\r\nbacciferum grows on rocks at the bottom of the Atlantic, between the\r\nparallels of 40° north and south of the equator, and, when detached, is\r\ndrifted uniformly to particular spots which never vary, or whether it is\r\npropagated and grows in the water; but the mass of that plant, west of\r\nthe Azores, occupies an area equal to that of France, and has not\r\nchanged its place since the time of Columbus. Fields of the same kind\r\ncover the sea at the Bahama Islands and other places, and two new\r\nspecies of it were discovered in the Antarctic seas.\r\n\r\nThe Macrocystis pyrifera and the Laminaria radiata are the most\r\nremarkable of marine plants for their gigantic size and the extent of\r\ntheir range. They were met with on the Antarctic coasts two degrees\r\nnearer the south pole than any other vegetable production, forming, with\r\none remarkable exception, the utmost limit of vegetable life in the\r\nsouth polar seas. The Macrocystis pyrifera exists in vast detached\r\nmasses, like green meadows, in every latitude from the south polar ocean\r\nto the 45th degree N. lat. in the Atlantic, and to the shores of\r\nCalifornia in the Pacific, where there are fields of it so impenetrable,\r\nthat it has saved vessels driven by the heavy swell towards that shore\r\nfrom shipwreck. It is never seen where the temperature of the water is\r\nat the freezing point, and is the largest of the vegetable tribe, being\r\noccasionally 300 or 400 feet long. The Laminaria abounds off the Cape of\r\nGood Hope and in the Antarctic Ocean. These two species form great part\r\nof a band of sea-weed that girds Kerguelen Islands so densely, that a\r\nboat can scarcely be pulled through it; and they are found in great\r\nabundance on the coasts of the Falkland group, and also in vast fields\r\nin the open sea, hundreds of miles from any land: had it ever grown on\r\nthe distant shores, it must have taken ages to travel so far, drifted by\r\nthe wind, currents, and the sand of the seas. The red, green, and purple\r\nlavers of Great Britain are found on the coasts of the Falkland Islands;\r\nand, though some of the northern weeds are not found in the intervening\r\nwarm seas, they reappear here. The Lessonia is the most remarkable\r\nmarine plant in this group of islands. Its stems, much thicker than a\r\nman’s leg, and from 8 to 10 feet long, fix themselves by clasping fibres\r\nto the rocks beyond the high-water mark. Many branches shoot upwards\r\nfrom these stems, from which long leaves droop into the water like\r\nwillows. There are immense submarine forests off Patagonia and Tierra\r\ndel Fuego, attached to the rocks at the bottom. These plants are so\r\nstrong and buoyant, that they bring up large masses of stone; and, as\r\nthey grow slanting, and stretch along the surface of the sea, they are\r\nsometimes 300 feet long. The quantity of living creatures which inhabit\r\nthese marine forests and the parasitical weeds attached to them is\r\ninconceivable, they absolutely teem with life. Of the species of marine\r\nplants which are strictly antarctic, including those in the seas of Van\r\nDiemen’s Land and New Zealand, Dr. Hooker has identified one-fifth with\r\nthe British Algæ.\r\n\r\nThe high latitudes of the Antarctic Ocean are not so destitute of\r\nvegetation as was at first believed. Most minute objects, altogether\r\ninvisible to the naked eye, except in mass, and which were taken for\r\nsiliceous shelled animalcules of the infusoria kind, prove to be\r\nvegetable. They are a species of the Diatomaceæ, which, from their\r\nmultitudes, give the sea a pale ochreous brown colour. They increase in\r\nnumbers with the latitude, up to the highest point yet attained by man,\r\nand, no doubt, afford the supply of food to many of the minute animals\r\nin the antarctic seas. Genera and species of this plant exist in every\r\nsea from Victoria Land to Spitzbergen. It is one of the remarkable\r\ninstances of a great end being effected by small means; for the death of\r\nthis antarctic vegetation is forming a submarine bank between the 76th\r\nand 78th parallels of south latitude, and from the 165th to the 160th\r\nwestern meridian.\r\n\r\nGreat patches of Confervæ are occasionally met with in the high seas.\r\nBands several miles long, of a reddish-brown species, like chopped hay,\r\noccur off Bahia, on the coast of Brazil; the same plant is said to have\r\ngiven the name to the Red Sea; and different species are common in the\r\nAustralian seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n                        Distribution of Insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE hundred thousand insects are known: some with wings, others\r\nwithout; some are aquatic, others are aquatic only in the first stage of\r\ntheir existence, and many are parasitical. Some land insects are\r\ncarnivorous, others feed on vegetables; some of the carnivorous tribe\r\nlive on dead, others on living animals, but they are not half so\r\nnumerous as those that live on vegetables. Some change as they are\r\ndeveloped; in their first stage they eat animal food, and vegetables\r\nwhen they come to maturity.\r\n\r\nInsects maintain the balance among the species of the vegetable creation\r\nby preventing the tendency that plants have to encroach on one another.\r\nThe stronger would extirpate the weaker, and the larger would destroy\r\nthe smaller, were it not checked by insects which live on vegetables. On\r\nthe other hand, many plants would be extirpated by insects were these\r\nnot devoured by other insects and spiders.\r\n\r\nOf the 8000 or 9000 British insects the greatest part are carnivorous,\r\nand therefore keep the others within due bounds.\r\n\r\nInsects increase in kinds and in numbers from the poles to the equator:\r\nin a residence of 11 months in Melville Island, Sir Edward Parry found\r\nonly 6 species, because lichens and mosses do not afford nourishment for\r\nthe insect tribes, though it is probable that every other kind of plant\r\ngives food and shelter to more than one species; it is even said that 40\r\ndifferent insects are quartered upon the common nettle.\r\n\r\nThe increase of insects from the poles to the equator does not take\r\nplace at the same time everywhere. The polar regions and New Holland\r\nhave very few specifically and individually; they are more abundant in\r\nNorthern Africa, Chile, and in the plains west of the Brazils; North\r\nAmerica has fewer species than Europe in the same latitude, and Asia has\r\nfew varieties of species in proportion to its size; Caffraria, the\r\nAfrican and Indian islands, possess nearly the same number of species;\r\nbut by far the richest of all, both in species and numbers, are central\r\nand intertropical America. Beetles are an exception to the law of\r\nincrease towards the equator, as they are infinitely more numerous in\r\nspecies in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere than in\r\nequatorial countries. The location of insects depends upon that of the\r\nplants which yield their food; and, as almost each plant is peopled with\r\ninhabitants peculiar to itself, insects are distributed over the earth\r\nin the same manner as vegetables; the groups, consequently, are often\r\nconfined within narrow limits, and it is extraordinary that,\r\nnotwithstanding their powers of locomotion, they often remain within a\r\nparticular compass, though the plants, and all other circumstances in\r\ntheir immediate vicinity, appear equally favourable for their\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\nThe insects of eastern Asia and China are different from those in Europe\r\nand Africa; those in the United States differ specifically from the\r\nBritish, though they often approach very near; and in South America the\r\nequinoctial districts of New Grenada and Peru have distinct groups from\r\nthose in Guiana.\r\n\r\nThough insects are distributed in certain limited groups, yet most of\r\nthe families have representatives in all the great regions of the globe,\r\nand some identical species are inhabitants of countries far from one\r\nanother. The Vanessa Cardui, or “Painted Lady Butterfly,” is found in\r\nall the four quarters of the globe and in Australia; and one, which\r\nnever could have been conveyed by man, is native in southern Europe, the\r\ncoast of Barbary, and Chile. It is evident from these circumstances that\r\nnot only each group, but also each particular species, must have been\r\noriginally created in the places they now inhabit.\r\n\r\nMountain-chains are a complete barrier to insects, even more so than\r\nrivers: not only lofty mountains like the Andes divide the kinds, but\r\nthey are even different on the two sides of the Col de Tende in the\r\nAlps. Each soil has kinds peculiar to itself, whether dry or moist,\r\ncultivated or wild, meadow or forest. Stagnant water and marshes are\r\ngenerally full of them; some live in water, some run on its surface, and\r\nevery water-plant affords food and shelter to many different kinds. The\r\neast wind seems to have considerable effect in bringing the insect or in\r\ndeveloping the eggs of certain species; for example, the aphis, known as\r\nthe blight in our country, lodges in myriads on plants, and shrivels up\r\ntheir leaves after a continued east wind. They are almost as destructive\r\nas the locust, and sometimes darken the air by their numbers.\r\nCaterpillars are also very destructive; the caterpillar of the Y moth\r\nwould soon ruin the vegetation of a country were it not a prey to some\r\nother. Insects sometimes multiply suddenly to an enormous extent, and\r\ndecrease as rapidly and as unaccountably.\r\n\r\nTemperature, by its influence on vegetation, has an indirect effect on\r\nthe insects that are to feed upon plants, and extremes of heat and cold\r\nhave more influence on their locality than the mean annual temperature.\r\nThus, in the polar regions the mosquito tribes are more numerous and\r\nmore annoying than in temperate countries, because they pass their early\r\nstages of existence in water, which shelters them, and the short but hot\r\nsummer is genial to their brief span of life.\r\n\r\nIn some instances height corresponds with latitude. The Parnassius\r\nApollo, a butterfly native in the plains of Sweden, is also found in the\r\nAlps, the Pyrenees, and a closely-allied species in the Himalaya. The\r\nParnassius Smyntheus, true to the habitat of the genus, has recently\r\nbeen found on the Rocky Mountains of North America. Some insects require\r\nseveral years to arrive at their perfect state; they lie buried in the\r\nground in the form of grubs: the cock-chafer comes to maturity in 3\r\nyears, and some American species require a much longer time.\r\n\r\nInsects do not attain their perfect state till the plants they are to\r\nfeed upon are ready for them. Hence, in cold and temperate climates\r\ntheir appearance is simultaneous with vegetation; and as the rainy and\r\ndry seasons within the tropics correspond to our winter and summer,\r\ninsects appear there after the rains, and vanish in the heat: the rains,\r\nif too violent, destroy them; and in countries where that occurs, there\r\nare two periods in the year in which they are most abundant—one before\r\nand one after the rains. It is also observed in Europe that insects\r\ndecrease in the heat of summer, and become more numerous in autumn: the\r\nheat is thought to throw some into a state of torpor, but the greater\r\nnumber perish.\r\n\r\nIt is not known that any insect depends entirely upon only one species\r\nof plant for its existence, or whether it may not have recourse to\r\ncongeners should its habitual plant perish. When particular species of\r\nplants of the same family occur in places widely apart, insects of the\r\nsame genus will be found on them, so that the existence of the plant may\r\noften be inferred from that of the insect, and, in several instances,\r\nthe converse.\r\n\r\nWhen a plant is taken from one country to another in which it has no\r\ncongeners, it is not attacked by the insects of the country: thus, our\r\ncabbages and carrots in Cayenne are not injured by the insects of that\r\ncountry, and the tulip-tree and other magnolias are not molested by our\r\ninsects; but if a plant has congeners in its new country, the\r\ninhabitants will soon find their way to the stranger.\r\n\r\nThe common fly is one of the most universal of insects, yet it was\r\nunknown in some of the South Sea islands till it was carried there by\r\nships from Europe, and it has now become a plague.\r\n\r\nThe mosquito and culex are spread over the world more generally than any\r\nother tribe; they are the torment of men and animals from the poles to\r\nthe equator by night and by day: the species are numerous, and their\r\nlocation partial. In the Arctic regions the Culex Pipiens, which passes\r\ntwo-thirds of its existence in water, swarms in summer in myriads: the\r\nlake Myvatr, in Iceland, has its name from the legions of these\r\ntormentors that cover its surface. They are less numerous in central\r\nEurope, though one species of mosquito, the Simulium columbaschense,\r\nwhich is very small, appears in such clouds in parts of Hungary,\r\nespecially the Bannat of Temeswar, that it is not possible to breathe\r\nwithout swallowing many: even cattle and children have died from them.\r\nIn Lapland there is a plague of the same kind. Of all places on earth\r\nthe Orinoco and other great rivers of tropical America are the most\r\nobnoxious to this plague. The account given by Baron Humboldt is really\r\nfearful: at no season of the year, at no hour of the day or night, can\r\nrest be found; whole districts in the upper Orinoco are deserted on\r\naccount of these insects. Different species follow one another with such\r\nprecision, that the time of day or night may be known accurately from\r\ntheir humming noise, and from the different sensations of pain which the\r\ndifferent poisons produce. The only respite is the interval of a few\r\nminutes between the departure of one gang and the arrival of their\r\nsuccessors, for the species do not mix. On some parts of the Orinoco the\r\nair is one dense cloud of poisonous insects to the height of 20 feet. It\r\nis singular that they do not infest rivers that have black water, and\r\neach white stream is peopled with its own kinds; though ravenous for\r\nblood, they can live without it, as they are found where no animals\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil the quantity of insects is so great in the woods, that their\r\nnoise is heard in a ship at anchor some distance from the shore.\r\n\r\nVarious genera of butterflies and moths are very limited in their\r\nhabitations, others are dispersed over the world, but the species are\r\nalmost always different. Bees and wasps are equally universal, yet each\r\ncountry has its own. The common honey-bee is the only European insect\r\ndirectly useful to man; it was introduced into North America not many\r\nyears ago, and is now spread over the continent: it is now naturalized\r\nin Van Diemen’s Land and New Zealand. European bees, of which there are\r\nmany species, generally have stings; the Australian bee, like a black\r\nfly, is without a sting; and in Brazil there are 30 species of stingless\r\nbees.\r\n\r\nFire-flies are mostly tropical, yet there are four species in Europe; in\r\nSouth America there are three species, and so brilliant that their pale\r\ngreen light is seen at the distance of 200 paces.\r\n\r\nThe silkworm comes from China, and the cochineal insect is a native of\r\ntropical America: there are many species of it in other countries. The\r\nCoccus Lacca is Indian, the Coccus Ilicis lives in Italy, and there is\r\none in Poland, but neither of these have been cultivated.\r\n\r\nScorpions under various forms are in all warm climates; 2 or 3 species\r\nare peculiar to Europe, but they are small in comparison with those in\r\ntropical countries: one in Brazil is six inches long. As in mosquitos,\r\nthe poison of the same species is more active in some situations than in\r\nothers. At Cumana the sting of the scorpion is little feared, while that\r\nof the same species in Carthagena causes loss of speech for many days.\r\n\r\nAnts, Formicidæ (Hymenoptera), are universally distributed, but of\r\ndifferent kinds. Near great rivers they build their nests above the line\r\nof the annual inundations. The insects called white ants, belonging to a\r\ndifferent genus and family Termitidæ (Neuroptera), are so destructive in\r\nSouth America, that Baron Humboldt says there is not a manuscript in\r\nthat country a hundred years old.\r\n\r\nThere are upwards of 1200 species of spiders and their allies known;\r\neach country has its own, varying in size, colour, and habits, from the\r\nhuge bird-catching spider of South America, to the almost invisible\r\nEuropean gossamer floating in the air on its silvery thread. Many of\r\nthis ferocious family are aquatic; and spiders, with some other insects,\r\nare said to be the first inhabitants of new islands.\r\n\r\nThe migration of insects is one of the most curious circumstances\r\nrelating to them: they sometimes appear in great flights in places where\r\nthey never were seen before, and they continue their course with\r\nperseverance which nothing can check. This has been observed in the\r\nmigration of crawling insects: caterpillars have attempted to cross a\r\nstream. Countries near deserts are most exposed to the invasion of\r\nlocusts, which deposit their eggs in the sand, and, when the young are\r\nhatched by the sun’s heat, they emerge from the ground without wings;\r\nbut as soon as they attain maturity, they obey the impulse of the first\r\nwind, and fly, under the guidance of a leader, in a mass, whose front\r\nkeeps a straight line, so dense that it forms a cloud in the air, and\r\nthe sound of their wings is like the murmur of the distant sea. They\r\ntake immense flights, crossing the Mozambique Channel from Africa to\r\nMadagascar, which is 120 miles broad: they come from Barbary to Italy,\r\nand a few have been seen in Scotland. Even the wandering tribes of\r\nlocusts differ in species in different deserts, following the universal\r\nlaw of organized nature. Insects, not habitually migratory, sometimes\r\nmigrate in great flocks. In 1847 lady-birds or coccinellæ and the bean\r\naphis arrived in immense multitudes at Ramsgate and Margate from the\r\ncontinent, in fine calm weather, and a mass of the Vanessa cardui flew\r\nover a district in a column from 10 to 15 yards wide, for 2 hours\r\nsuccessively. Why these butterflies should simultaneously take wing in a\r\nflock is unaccountable, for had it been for want of food they would\r\nprobably have separated in quest of it. In 1847 the cabbage butterfly\r\ncame in a mass from the coast of France to England. Dragon-flies migrate\r\nin a similar manner. Professor Ehrenberg has discovered a new world of\r\ncreatures in the Infusoria, so minute that they are invisible to the\r\nnaked eye. He found them in fog, rain, and snow, in the ocean, in\r\nstagnant water, in animal and vegetable juices, in volcanic ashes and\r\npumice, in opal, in the dusty air that sometimes falls on the ocean; and\r\nhe detected 18 species 20 feet below the surface of the ground in\r\npeat-earth, which was full of microscopic live animals: they exist in\r\nice, and are not killed by boiling water. This lowest order of animal\r\nlife is much more abundant than any other, and new species are found\r\nevery day. Magnified, some of them seem to consist of a transparent\r\nvesicle, and some have a tail: they move with great alacrity, and show\r\nintelligence by avoiding obstacles in their course: others have\r\nsiliceous shells. Language, and even imagination, fails in the attempt\r\nto describe the inconceivable myriads of these invisible inhabitants of\r\nthe ocean, the air, and the earth: they no doubt become the prey of\r\nlarger creatures, and perhaps bloodsucking insects may have recourse to\r\nthem when other prey is wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nDistribution of Marine Animals in general—Fishes—the Marine Mammalia—\r\n  Phocæ, Dolphins, and Whales.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE Sir James Ross’s voyage to the Antarctic regions, the profound\r\nand dark abysses of the ocean were supposed to be entirely destitute of\r\nanimal life; now it may be presumed that no part of it is uninhabited,\r\nsince during that expedition live creatures were fished up from a depth\r\nof 6000 feet. But as most of the larger fish usually frequent shallow\r\nwater near the coasts, deep seas must form barriers as impassable to the\r\ngreater number of them as mountains do to land animals. The polar, the\r\nequatorial ocean, and the inland seas, have each their own particular\r\ninhabitants; almost all the species and some of the genera of the marine\r\ncreation are different in the two hemispheres, and even in each\r\nparticular sea; and under similar circumstances the species are for the\r\nmost part representative, though not the same. Identity of species,\r\nhowever, does occur, even at the two extremities of the globe, for\r\nliving animals were brought up from the profound depths of the Antarctic\r\nOcean which Sir James Ross recognized to be the very same species which\r\nhe had often met with in the Arctic seas. “The only way they could have\r\ngot from the one pole to the other must have been through the tropics;\r\nbut the temperature of the sea in these regions is such that they could\r\nnot exist in it unless at a depth of nearly 2000 fathoms. At that depth\r\nthey might pass from the Arctic to the Antarctic Ocean without a\r\nvariation of 5 degrees of temperature; whilst any land animal, at the\r\nmost favourable season, must experience a difference of 50 degrees, and,\r\nif in winter, no less than 150 degrees of Fahrenheit’s thermometer;”—a\r\nstrong presumption that marine creatures can exist at the depth and\r\nunder the enormous pressure of 12,000 feet of water. The stratum of\r\nconstant temperature in the ocean may indeed afford the means of\r\nmigration from pole to pole to those which live in shallower water, as\r\nthey would only have to descend to a depth of 7200 feet at the equator.\r\nThe great currents, no doubt, offer paths for fish without any sudden\r\nchange of temperature: the inhabitants of the Antarctic Sea may come to\r\nthe coasts of Chile and Peru by the cold stream that flows along them\r\nfrom the south polar ocean, and, on the contrary, tropical fish may\r\ntravel by the Gulf-stream to the middle and high latitudes in the\r\nAtlantic, but few will leave either one or other to inhabit the adjacent\r\nseas, on account of the difference of heat. Nevertheless, quantities of\r\nmedusæ or sea-nettles are brought by the Gulf-stream to feed the whales\r\nat the Azores, though the whales themselves never enter the stream, on\r\naccount of its warmth.\r\n\r\nThe form and nature of the coasts have great influence on the\r\ndistribution of fishes; when they are uniformly of the same geological\r\nstructure, so as to afford the same food and shelter, the fish are\r\nsimilar. Their distribution is also determined by climate, the depth of\r\nthe sea, the nature of the bottom, and the influx of fresh water.\r\n\r\nThe ocean, the most varied and most wonderful part of the creation,\r\nabsolutely teems with life: “things innumerable, both great and small,\r\nare there.” The forms are not to be numbered even of those within our\r\nreach; yet, numerous as they are, few have been found exempt from the\r\nlaws of geographical distribution.\r\n\r\nThe discoloured portions of the ocean generally owe the tints they\r\nassume to myriads of insects. In the Arctic seas, where the water is\r\npure transparent ultramarine colour, parts of 20 or 30 square miles,\r\n1500 feet deep, are green and turbid from the quantity of minute\r\nanimalcules. Captain Scoresby calculated that it would require 80,000\r\npersons, working unceasingly from the creation of man to the present\r\nday, to count the number of insects contained in 2 miles of the green\r\nwater. What, then, must be the amount of animal life in the polar\r\nregions, where one-fourth part of the Greenland Sea, for 10 degrees of\r\nlatitude, consists of that water! These animalcules are of the medusa\r\ntribe, mixed with others that are moniliform. Some medusæ are very\r\nlarge, floating like jelly; and although apparently carried at random by\r\nthe waves, each species has its definite location, and even organs of\r\nlocomotion. One species comes in spring from the Greenland seas to the\r\ncoast of Holland; and Baron Humboldt met with an immense shoal of them\r\nin the Atlantic, migrating at a rapid rate.\r\n\r\nDr. Pœppig mentions a stratum of red water near Cape Pilares, 24 miles\r\nlong and 7 broad, which, seen from the mast-head, appeared dark-red, but\r\non proceeding it became a brilliant purple, and the wake of the vessel\r\nwas rose-colour. The water was perfectly transparent, but small red dots\r\ncould be discerned moving in spiral lines. The vermilion sea off\r\nCalifornia is no doubt owing to a similar cause, as Mr. Darwin found red\r\nand chocolate-coloured water on the coast of Chile over spaces of\r\nseveral square miles full of microscopic animalcules, darting about in\r\nevery direction, and sometimes exploding. Infusoria are not confined to\r\nfresh water; the bottom of the sea swarms with them. Siliceous-coated\r\ninfusoria are found in the mud of the coral islands under the equator;\r\nand 68 species were discovered in the mud in Erebus Bay, near the\r\nAntarctic pole. These minute forms of organized being, invisible to the\r\nnaked eye, are intensely and extensively developed in both of the polar\r\noceans, and serve for food to the higher orders of fish in latitudes\r\nbeyond the limits of the larger vegetation, though they themselves\r\nprobably live on the microscopic plant already mentioned, which abounds\r\nin all seas. Some are peculiar to each of the polar seas, some are\r\ncommon to both, and a few are distributed extensively throughout the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nThe enormous prodigality of animal life supplies the place of\r\nvegetation, so scanty in the ocean in comparison with that which clothes\r\nthe land, and which probably would be insufficient for the supply of the\r\nmarine creation, were the deficiency not made up by the superabundant\r\nland vegetation and insects carried to the sea by rivers. The fish that\r\nlive on sea-weed must bear a smaller proportion to those that are\r\npredacious than the herbivorous land animals do to the carnivorous. Fish\r\ncertainly are most voracious; none are without their enemies; they prey\r\nand are preyed upon; and there are two which devour even the live coral,\r\nhard as its coating is; nor does the coat of mail of shell-fish protect\r\nthem. Whatever the proportion may be which predatory fish bear to\r\nherbivorous, the quantity of both must be enormous, for, besides the\r\ninfusoria, the great forests of fuci and sea-weed are everywhere a mass\r\nof infinitely varied forms of being, either parasitical, feeding on\r\nthem, seeking shelter among them, or in pursuit of others.\r\n\r\nThe observations of Professor E. Forbes in the Egean Sea show that depth\r\nhas great influence in the geographical distribution of marine animals.\r\nFrom the surface to the depth of 230 fathoms there are eight distinct\r\nregions in that sea, each of which has its own vegetation and\r\ninhabitants. The number of shell-fish and other marine animals is\r\ngreater specifically and individually between the surface and the depth\r\nof 2 fathoms than in all the regions below taken together, and both\r\ndecrease downwards to the depth of 105 fathoms; between which and the\r\ndepth of 230 only eight shells were found; and animal life ceases in\r\nthat part of the Mediterranean at 300 fathoms. The changes in the\r\ndifferent zones are not abrupt; some of the creatures of an under region\r\nalways appear before those of the region above vanish; and although\r\nthere are a few species the same in some of the eight zones, only two\r\nare common to all. Those near the surface have forms and colours\r\nbelonging to the inhabitants of southern latitudes, while those lower\r\ndown are analogous to the animals of northern seas; so that in the sea\r\ndepth corresponds with latitude, as height does on land. Moreover, the\r\nextent of the geographical distribution of any species is proportional\r\nto the depth at which it lives; consequently, those living near the\r\nsurface are less widely dispersed than those inhabiting deep water.\r\nProfessor Forbes also discovered several shells living in the\r\nMediterranean that have hitherto only been known as fossils of the\r\ntertiary strata; and also that the species least abundant as fossils are\r\nmost numerous alive, and the converse; hence, the former are near their\r\nmaximum, while the latter are approaching to extinction. These very\r\nimportant experiments, it is true, were confined to the Mediterranean;\r\nbut analogous results have been obtained in the Bay of Biscay and in the\r\nBritish seas. There are four zones of depth in our seas, each of which\r\nhas its own inhabitants, consisting of shell-fish, crustaceæ, corallines\r\nand other marine creatures. The first zone lies between high and\r\nlow-water marks, consequently it is shallow in some places and 30 feet\r\ndeep in others. In all parts of the northern hemisphere it presents the\r\nsame phenomena; but the animals vary with the nature of the coast,\r\naccording as it is of rock, gravel, sand, or mud. In the British seas\r\nthe animals of this littoral or coast zone are distributed in three\r\ngroups that differ decidedly from one another, though many are common to\r\nall. One occupies the seas on the southern shores of our islands and\r\nboth channels; a middle group has its centre in the Irish seas; and the\r\nthird is confined to the Scottish seas, and the adjacent coasts of\r\nEngland and Ireland. The second zone extends from the low-water mark to\r\na depth below it of from 7 to 15 fathoms, and is crowded with animals\r\nliving on and among the sea-weeds, as radiated animals, shell-fish, and\r\nmany zoophites. In the third zone, which is below that of vegetable\r\nlife, marine animals are more numerous and of greater variety than in\r\nany other. It is particularly distinguished by arborescent creatures,\r\nthat seem to take the place of plants, carnivorous mollusca, together\r\nwith large and peculiar radiata. It ranges from the depth of 15 to 50\r\nfathoms. The last zone is the region of stronger corals, peculiar\r\nmollusca, and of others that only inhabit deep water. This zone extends\r\nto the depth of 100 fathoms or more.\r\n\r\nExcept in the Antarctic seas, the superior zone of shell-fish is the\r\nonly one of which anything is known in the great oceans, which have\r\nnumerous special provinces. Many, like the harp, are tropical; others,\r\nas the nautilus and the pearl-oyster, are nearly so; the latter abounds\r\nthroughout the Persian Gulf and on the coasts of Borneo and Ceylon,\r\nwhich are thought to produce the finest pearls. There are many also in\r\nthe Caribbean Sea, and in the Pacific, and especially in the Bay of\r\nPanama, but whether the species are different is not known. Some shells\r\nare exceedingly limited in their distribution, as the Haliotis gigantea,\r\nwhich is peculiar to the sea of Van Diemen’s Land.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir Charles Lyell, nearly all the species of molluscous\r\nanimals in the seas of the two temperate zones are distinct, yet the\r\nwhole species in one bears a strong analogy to that in the other; both\r\ndiffer widely from those in the tropical and arctic oceans; and, under\r\nthe same latitude, species vary with the longitude. The east and west\r\ncoasts of tropical America have only one shell-fish in common; and those\r\nof both differ from the shell-fish in the islands of the Pacific and the\r\nGalapagos Archipelago, which forms a distinct region. Notwithstanding\r\nthe many definite marine provinces, the same species are occasionally\r\nfound in regions widely separated. A few of the shell-fish of the\r\nGalapagos Archipelago are the same with those of the Philippine islands,\r\nthough so far apart. The east coast of America, which is poor in\r\nshell-fish, has a considerable number in common with the coasts of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe Cypræa moneta lives in the Mediterranean, the seas of South Africa,\r\nthe Mauritius, the East Indies, China, and the South Seas even to\r\nOtaheite; and the Janthina frangilis, the animal of which is of a\r\nbeautiful violet-colour, floats on the surface in every tropical and\r\ntemperate sea. Mollusca have a greater power of locomotion than is\r\ngenerally believed. Some migrate in their larva state, being furnished\r\nwith lobes which enable them to swim freely. The larva of the scalop is\r\ncapable of migrating to distant regions; the argonauta spreads its sail\r\nand swims along the surface.\r\n\r\nThe numerous species of Zoophytes which construct the extensive coral\r\nbanks and atolls are chiefly confined to the tropical seas of Polynesia,\r\nthe East and West Indies: the family is represented by a very few\r\nspecies in our seas, and in the Mediterranean they are smaller and\r\ndifferent, generally, from those in the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nThe larger and more active inhabitants of the waters obey the same laws\r\nwith the rest of the creation, though the provinces are in some\r\ninstances very extensive. Dr. Richardson observes that there is one vast\r\nprovince in the Pacific, extending 42 degrees on each side of the\r\nequator, between the meridians including Australia, New Zealand, the\r\nMalay Archipelago, China, and Japan, in which the genera are the same;\r\nbut at its extremities the Arctic and Antarctic genera are mingled with\r\nthe tropical forms. Many species, however, which abound in the Indian\r\nOcean range as far north as Japan, from which circumstance it is\r\npresumed that a current sets in that direction. The middle portion of\r\nthis province is vastly extended in longitude, for very many species of\r\nthe Red Sea, the eastern coast of Africa, and the Mauritius range to the\r\nIndian and China Seas, to those of northern Australia and all Polynesia;\r\nso in this immense belt, which embraces three-fourths of the\r\ncircumference of the globe, and 60 degrees of latitude, the fish are\r\nvery nearly alike, the continuous chains of islands in the Pacific being\r\nfavourable to their dispersion. Few of the Pacific fish enter the\r\nAtlantic;[174] and from the depth and want of islands in it the great\r\nbulk of species is different on its two sides. North of the 44th\r\nparallel, however, the number common to both shores increases. The\r\nsalmon of America is identical with that of the British isles, the\r\ncoasts of Norway and Sweden; the cod-fish is the same, as well as\r\nseveral others of the cod family. The Cottus or bullhead tribe are also\r\nthe same on both sides of the North Atlantic, and they increase in\r\nnumbers and variety on approaching the Arctic seas. The same occurs in\r\nthe northern Pacific, though the generic forms differ from those in the\r\nAtlantic. From the near approach of the American and Asiatic coasts at\r\nBehring’s Straits, the fish on both sides are nearly alike, down to the\r\nSea of Okhotsk on one side and to Admiralty Inlet on the other. The\r\nJapan Sea and the neighbouring coasts of China are frequented by fish\r\nhaving northern forms, which are there mingled with many species common\r\nto the temperate and warm parts of the ocean. Species of the genus Gadus\r\nor Cod reappear in the southern seas very like those of the northern;\r\nand two very remarkable Greenland genera, which inhabit deeper water,\r\nand are seldom taken except when thrown up by a storm, have been\r\ndiscovered on the coasts of New Zealand and South Australia, where the\r\nfish differ but little from those in the seas of Van Diemen’s Land.\r\nSeveral genera are peculiar to the southern hemisphere, and range\r\nthroughout the whole circle of the high latitudes. The sharks of the\r\nChina seas are, for the most part, identical with those of Australia:\r\nthe cartilaginous fish to which they belong have a much wider range than\r\nthose which have been under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe British islands lie between two great provinces of fishes—one to the\r\nsouth, the other to the north—from each of which we have occasionally\r\nvisitors. The centre of the first is on the coasts of the Spanish\r\npeninsula, extending into the Mediterranean; that on the north has its\r\ncentre about the Shetland Islands; but the group peculiarly British, and\r\nfound nowhere else, has its focus in the Irish Sea. It is, however,\r\nmixed with fish from the seas bounding the western shores of central\r\nEurope, which form a distinct group.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Canino has shown that there are 853 species of European\r\nfish, of which 210 live in fresh water, 643 are marine, and 60 of these\r\ngo up rivers to spawn. 444 of the marine fish inhabit the Mediterranean,\r\n216 are British, and 171 are peculiar to the Scandinavian seas; so that\r\nthe Mediterranean is richest in variety of species. In it there are\r\npeculiar sharks, sword-fish, dolphins, anchovies, and six species of\r\nscomber or tunny, one of the largest of edible fish, for which fisheries\r\nare established on the southern coasts of France, in Sardinia, Elba, the\r\nStraits of Messina, and the Adriatic. Four of the species are found\r\nnowhere else but in the Mediterranean. Rays of numerous species are\r\nparticularly characteristic of the Mediterranean, especially the two\r\ntorpedos, which have the power of giving an electric shock, and even the\r\nelectric spark. The Mediterranean has two or three American species, 41\r\nfish in common with Madeira, one in common with the Red Sea, and a very\r\nfew seem to be Indian. Some of these fish must have entered the\r\nMediterranean before it was separated from the Red Sea by the Isthmus of\r\nSuez; but geological changes have had very great influence on the\r\ndistribution of fishes everywhere. Taking salt and fresh-water fish\r\ntogether, there are 100 species common to Italy and Britain; and\r\nalthough the communication with the Black Sea is so direct, there are\r\nonly 27 fish common to it and the Mediterranean; but the Black Sea forms\r\na district by itself, having its own peculiar fish; and those in the\r\nCaspian Sea differ entirely from those in every other part of the globe.\r\nThe island of Madeira, solitary amid a great expanse of ocean, has many\r\nspecies. They amount in number to half of those in Britain; and nearly\r\nas many are common to Britain and Madeira as to that island and the\r\nMediterranean; so that many of our fish have a wide range in the\r\nAtlantic. The Mediterranean certainly surpasses the British and\r\nScandinavian seas in variety, though it is far inferior to either in the\r\nquantity or quality of useful fish. Cod, turbot, haddock, tusk, ling,\r\nherring, and many more, are better in northern seas than elsewhere, and\r\nseveral exist there only.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of fish used by man as food frequent shoal water. The\r\ncoast of Holland, our own shores, and other parts of the North Sea where\r\nthe water is shallow, teem with a never-ending supply of excellent fish\r\nof many kinds.\r\n\r\nVast numbers are gregarious and migratory. Cod arrive in the shallow\r\nparts of the coast of Norway in February, in shoals many yards deep, and\r\nso closely crowded together that the sounding-lead can hardly pass\r\nbetween them: 16,000,000 have been caught in one place in a few weeks.\r\nIn April they return to the ocean. Herrings come in astonishing\r\nquantities in winter.\r\n\r\nThe principal cod fisheries are on the banks of Newfoundland and the\r\nDogger-bank. They, like all animals, frequent the places to which they\r\nhave been accustomed. Herrings come to the same places for a series of\r\nyears, and then desert them, perhaps from having exhausted the food.\r\nPilchards, mackerel, and many others, may be mentioned among the\r\ngregarious and migratory fish.\r\n\r\nSharks like deep water. They are found of different species in all\r\ntropical and temperate seas; and, although always dangerous, they are\r\nmore ferocious in some places than in others, even of the same species.\r\n\r\nMost lakes have fish of peculiar species, as the lake Baikal. The fishes\r\nof the great interalpine Lake of Titicaca amount to 7 or 8 species, and\r\nbelong to genera only found in the higher regions of the Andes. In the\r\nNorth American lakes there is a thick-scaled fish, analogous to those of\r\nthe early geological eras; and the gillaroo trout, which is remarkable\r\nin having a gizzard, is found in Ireland only. Pike and salmon are the\r\nonly species of fresh-water fish common to Europe and North America; the\r\npike is, however, unknown west of the Rocky Mountains. The common salmon\r\ndoes not exist beyond 45° of N. lat. on the eastern coast of America,\r\nand it is probably confined within similar limits on the eastern coast\r\nof Asia. It is said to be an inhabitant of all the northern parts of the\r\nold world from the entrance of the Bay of Biscay to North Cape, and\r\nalong the arctic shores of Asia and Kamtchatka to the Sea of Okhotsk,\r\nincluding the Baltic, White Sea, Gulf of Kara, and other inlets. Other\r\nkinds of the Salmon tribe are plentiful in the estuaries of Kamtchatka\r\nand on the opposite coast of America down to Oregon, but apparently they\r\ndo not extend to China. Salmon go up rivers to spawn, and make\r\nextraordinary leaps over impediments of rocks or walls, in order to\r\nreach the suitable places for depositing their eggs. Forty-four fish\r\ninhabit the British lakes and rivers, and 50 those of Scandinavia, of\r\nthe very best kinds. The fresh-water fish of northern climates are\r\nbetter than those of the southern.\r\n\r\nEach tropical river has its own species of fish. The fresh-water fish of\r\nChina agree with those of India in generic forms, but not in\r\nspecies;[175] and those of the Cape of Good Hope and South America\r\ndiffer from those in India and China. Sea-fish, in immense quantities,\r\nfrequent the estuaries of rivers everywhere. The mouth of the\r\nMississippi is full of fish; and the quantity at the mouth of the Don,\r\nin the Sea of Azof, is prodigious.\r\n\r\nThere are some singular analogies between the inhabitants of the sea and\r\nthose of the land. Many of the medusæ, two corallines, the Physalia, or\r\nPortuguese man-of-war, of sailors, and some others, sting like a nettle\r\nwhen touched. A cuttle-fish, at the Cape de Verde islands, changes\r\ncolour like the chameleon, assuming the tint of the ground under it.\r\nHerrings, pilchards, and many other fish, as well as sea insects, are\r\nluminous. The medusa tribe, the species of which are numerous, have the\r\nfaculty of shedding light in the highest degree. In warm climates,\r\nespecially, the sea seems to be on fire, and the wake of a ship is like\r\na vivid flame. Probably fish that go below the depths to which the light\r\nof the sun penetrates are endowed with this faculty; and shoals of\r\nluminous insects have been seen at a considerable depth below the\r\nsurface of the water. The glow-worm, some beetles, and fire-flies, shine\r\nwith the same pale-green light. But among the terrestrial inhabitants\r\nthere is nothing analogous to the property of the Gymnotus electricus of\r\nSouth America, the trembler, or Silurus electricus, of the African\r\nrivers, and the different species of the torpedo of the Mediterranean,\r\nwhich possess the faculty of giving the electric shock.\r\n\r\nThe marine mammalia, which, as their name indicates, suckle their young,\r\nform two distinct families—the Phocæ or seals, and the Cetacea or\r\nwhales, and porpoises: whilst fish breathe by means of gills, which\r\nseparate the air dissolved in the water, the marine mammalia possess\r\nlungs and breathe as the terrestrial quadrupeds; they are obliged to\r\ncome to the surface from time to time, consequently, to inhale the air.\r\n\r\nThe first family consists of the seal tribe, and is most abundant in the\r\npolar regions; they live exclusively on fish, are carnivorous, and are\r\nseldom found at a great distance from the land or ice islands. To this\r\ndivision belong the common seal and the walrus in our northern\r\nhemisphere; whilst the genus Otaria or sea-lion, with different forms\r\nand characters, and which attains in general a greater size, is only\r\nfound in high southern latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe family of Cetacea consists of three great genera: the manati and\r\ndugong, which live in or near the estuaries of tropical rivers, are\r\nherbivorous; the dolphins or porpoises, which are carnivorous, provided\r\nwith long jaws and numerous teeth, and are found in almost every\r\nlatitude and in every sea; and the whales, which, unprovided with\r\ncutting teeth, are furnished with whalebone inserted in the upper jaw,\r\nthe extreme filaments of which are destined as a kind of net to catch\r\nthe minute marine animals which form their food. The marine Cetacea\r\nbreathe by an opening in the centre of the head, called, in whales, the\r\nblower, corresponding to the nose of terrestrial quadrupeds, and which\r\nalso serves to expel the water taken into the mouth with the food, in\r\nthe form of jets, which, in the whale tribe, varies in height and form\r\naccording to the species.\r\n\r\nThe favorite haunts of the seal tribe are the polar oceans and desert\r\nislands in high latitudes, where they bask in hundreds on the sunny\r\nshores during the brief summer of these inhospitable regions, and become\r\nan easy prey to man, who has nearly extirpated the race in many places.\r\nA million are annually killed in the South Atlantic alone. Seven species\r\nare natives of the Arctic, Atlantic, and Polar Oceans; the Greenland\r\nseal, the bearded or great seal, and the Phoca leporina are found also\r\nin the high latitudes of the Northern Pacific. The Phoca oceanica is\r\nonly in the White Sea and the sea at Nova Zembla, and the Phoca sagura\r\non the coast of Newfoundland. The sea-lion is to be found on all the\r\ncoasts of the South Pacific, but their principal gathering is on the\r\nisland of St. George, one of the Pruibiloff group, in lat. 56° N. The\r\ncommon seal is 6 or 7 feet long, with a face like that of a dog, and a\r\nlarge intelligent eye. It is easily tamed, and in the Orkney island it\r\nis so much domesticated that it follows its master, and helps him to\r\ncatch fish. This seal migrates in herds from Greenland twice in the\r\nyear, and returns again to its former haunts; they probably come to the\r\ncoasts of Europe and the British islands at the time of their\r\nmigrations, but the Phoca vitulina is a constant inhabitant of our\r\nshores. Some of the seal tribe have a very wide range, as the fur\r\nspecies, Arctocephalus ursinus, of the Falkland islands, which at one\r\ntime frequented the southern coasts of New Holland in multitudes, but\r\nthey and three other species have now become scarce, from the\r\nindiscriminate slaughter of old and young. Sir James Ross found some of\r\nthe islands in the Antarctic seas overrun with the sea-elephant, Phoca\r\nelephantina, and they captured a new species of seal without external\r\nears. The Walrus, a grim-looking creature, with tusks 2 feet long, bent\r\ndownwards, and its nose covered with transparent bristles, has a body\r\nlike that of a seal, 20 feet long, with a coat of short grey or yellow\r\nhair. It sleeps on the floating ice, feeds on sea-weed and marine\r\nanimals, and never leaves the Arctic seas.\r\n\r\nThe manati and dugong form the first group of the family of the Cetacea;\r\nthey are exclusively herbivorous, and inhabit near the mouths of the\r\ngreat tropical rivers. The lamantin or manatus of two species is found\r\nin the Amazon and Orinoco, and in some rivers of Western Africa. In the\r\nformer, where it is known as the sea-cow, its body is round like a\r\nwine-bag, and sometimes attains a length of 12 or 15 feet; it browses in\r\nherds on the herbage at the bottom of streams; and when attacked, the\r\nmother defends her young at the sacrifice of her own life. The dugong is\r\nan inhabitant of the eastern archipelago, and of the shallow parts of\r\nthe Indian Ocean, where it also feeds on sea-weed; it is more a marine\r\nanimal than the lamantin, as it is scarcely ever seen in fresh water.\r\nThe dugong is so harmless and tame as to allow itself to be handled.\r\nWhen it suckles its young it sits upright, which has given rise to the\r\nfable of the Mermaid. This animal, like the lamantin, will sacrifice its\r\nlife for its young, and is, hence, among the Malays, held as the type of\r\nmaternal affection. The animal called the Manatus septentrionalis, which\r\nfrequents the Arctic seas, is very little known, and probably not one of\r\nthe herbivorous Cetacea.\r\n\r\nThe second group or genus of the Cetacea consists of those of predatory\r\nhabits; they live on fish, and, consequently, have sharp and numerous\r\nteeth, such as porpoises, dolphins, and spermaceti whales or Cachalots;\r\nthey have, like all the animals of this family, spouting nostrils in the\r\nupper part of the head.[176] The common porpoise is seen spouting and\r\ntumbling on the surface of all the seas of Europe; shoals of them go in\r\npursuit of herrings and mackerel, and even swim up the rivers in chase\r\nof salmon. They have more the form of fish than the seal tribe, and have\r\na dorsal fin. The several species of Dolphins, so remarkable for their\r\nvoracity and for the swiftness of their motions, owing to the symmetry\r\nof their form and the width of their horizontally-placed tail, are seen\r\nin almost every latitude. The white dolphin, eaten by the Icelanders, is\r\n18 feet long, and migrates from the Atlantic to Greenland in the end of\r\nNovember. The Grampus, Delphinus Orca, nearly allied to the killer of\r\nthe South Sea whalers, is fierce and voracious, often 20 feet long,\r\nroams in numerous shoals, preying upon the larger fish, and even\r\nattacking the whale. The Grind or black dolphin has been known to run\r\nashore in hundreds in the bays of Feroe, Orkney, and Shetland. This\r\nseems to be the same or nearly allied to the black fish which was met\r\nwith in vast numbers by Sir James Ross in the Antarctic seas: they had\r\nso little fear, that they darted below the ship on one side and came up\r\nat the other. The white porpoise, Delphinus peronii, of the southern\r\nwhalers, is a rare and elegant species of dolphin which chiefly inhabits\r\nthe high southern latitudes, but has been seen at the equator in the\r\nPacific. They are about six feet long, the hinder part of the head, the\r\nback, and the flukes of their tail are black, and all the rest of the\r\npurest white. The Narwhal, or sea-unicorn (Monodon monoceros), has no\r\nteeth, but a tusk of fine ivory wreathed with a spiral groove extending\r\n8 or 10 feet straight from the head; in general there is only one tusk,\r\nbut there are always the rudiments of another, and occasionally both\r\ngrow to an equal length. The old narwhals are white with blackish spots,\r\nthe young are dark-coloured. This singular creature, which is about\r\nsixteen feet long without the tusks, swims with great swiftness. Mr.\r\nScoresby has seen 15 or 20 at a time playing round his ship in the\r\nArctic seas, and crossing their long tusks in all directions as if they\r\nwere fencing; they are found in all parts of the Northern Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe spermaceti whale, the Cachalot or Physeter Macrocephalus, belonging\r\nto the family of the predaceous spouters, is one of the most formidable\r\ninhabitants of the deep. Its average size is 60 feet long and 40 feet in\r\ncircumference; its head, equal to a third of its length, is extremely\r\nthick and blunt in front, with a throat wide enough to swallow a man.\r\nThe proportionally small swimming paws or pectoral fins are at a short\r\ndistance behind the head, and the tail, which is a horizontal triangle 6\r\nor 7 feet long, and 19 feet wide, with a notch between the flukes, is\r\nthe chief organ of progressive motion and defence. It has a hump of fat\r\non its back, is of a dark colour, but with a very smooth clean skin.\r\nThese sperm whales have two nostrils on the top of their head, through\r\nwhich they throw, at each expiration, a succession of jets like smoke,\r\nat intervals of 15 or 20 minutes, after which they toss their tails high\r\nin the air and go head foremost to vast depths, where they remain for a\r\nconsiderable time, and then return again to the surface to breathe. The\r\njet or spout is from 6 to 8 feet high, and consists of water mixed with\r\nair, expired from the lungs. This whale has sperm-oil and spermaceti in\r\nevery part of its body, but the latter is chiefly in a vast reservoir in\r\nits head, which makes it very buoyant, and ambergris is sometimes found\r\nin the inside of the body, supposed to be the produce of disease. These\r\nhuge monsters, occasionally 75 feet long, go in great herds of 500 or\r\n600, or schools, as the whalers call them. Females with their young, and\r\ntwo or three old males, generally form one company, and the young males\r\nanother, while the old males feed and hunt singly. The sperm whales swim\r\ngracefully and equally, with their head above the water; but when a\r\ntroop of them play on the surface of the water, some of these uncouth\r\nand gigantic creatures leap with the agility of a salmon several feet\r\ninto the air, and fall down again heavily with a tremendous crash and\r\nnoise like a cannon, driving the water up in lofty columns capped with\r\nfoam. The fishery of the sperm whale is attended with great danger; not\r\nonly the wounded animal, but its companions who come to its aid,\r\nsometimes fight desperately, killing the whalers and tossing them into\r\nthe air with a sweep of their tremendous tails, or biting a boat in two.\r\nIn 1820, the American whaler Essex was wrecked in the Pacific by a sperm\r\nwhale; it first gave the ship so severe a blow that it broke off part of\r\nthe keel, then, retreating to a distance, it rushed furiously, and with\r\nits enormous head beat in a portion of the planks, and the people had\r\njust time to save themselves in the boats when the vessel filled. They\r\noften lie and listen when suspicious of mischief. No part of the aqueous\r\nglobe, except the Arctic seas, is free from their visits; they have been\r\nseen in the Mediterranean and the Adriatic, in the British Channel, and\r\neven in the estuary of the Thames, but their chief resort is the deepest\r\nparts of the warmer seas within or near the tropics, and in the\r\nAntarctic Ocean, where they feed on floating molluscæ, the sepia or\r\ncuttle-fish, &c.\r\n\r\nThe second and last genus of the Cetacea are whalebone whales, such as\r\nthe Greenland whale and rorquals. Instead of teeth, the upper jaws of\r\nthese animals are furnished with plates and filaments of whalebone,\r\nwhich are moveable, and are adapted to retain, as in a net, the medusæ\r\nand other small marine animals that are the food of these colossal\r\ninhabitants of the deep. The common Greenland species, Balæna\r\nMysticetus, was formerly much more numerous, but it is now chiefly\r\nconfined to the very high northern latitudes; however, should it be the\r\nsame with the whale found in such multitudes in shallow water on the\r\ncoasts of the Pacific and in the Antarctic Ocean by Sir James Ross, it\r\nmust have a very wide range, but it is more probable that each pole has\r\nits own species. The Greenland whale is from 65 to 70 feet long, but\r\nthey are so much persecuted that they probably never live long enough to\r\ncome to their full size. The head is very large, but the opening of the\r\nthroat is so narrow that it can only swallow small animals. It has no\r\ndorsal fin: the swimming paws are about nine feet long, and the flat\r\ntail is half-moon shaped and notched in the middle. It has two spouts or\r\nnostrils, through which it throws jets like puffs of smoke some yards\r\nhigh. It only remains two or three minutes on the surface to breathe,\r\nand then goes under water for five or six. The back and tail are\r\nvelvet-black, shaded in some places into grey, the rest is white: some\r\nare piebald. The capture of this whale is often attended with much\r\ncruelty, from their affection for their young; indeed the custom of\r\nkilling the calf in order to capture the mother has ruined the fishery\r\nin several places, especially in New Zealand, where there were eight\r\nspecies of whales in vast abundance.\r\n\r\nRorquals are also whalebone whales, differing from the common whale in\r\nthe more elongated form of the head. One species is from 80 to 100 feet\r\nlong, the largest of marine animals. The bottle-nosed whale, a smaller\r\nspecies, was exceedingly numerous in the Arctic seas; in the year 1809,\r\n1100 were stranded in Huel-fiord in Iceland. This whale travels to lower\r\nlatitudes in pursuit of herrings and other fish. It had been caught on\r\nthe coast of Norway as early as the year 890, and probably long before.\r\nThe first northern navigators were not attracted by the whale as an\r\nobject of commerce, but stumbled upon it in their search for a\r\nnorth-west passage to the Pacific. The hump-backed whale, Balæna\r\ngibbosa, a rorqual 30 or 40 feet long, is met with in small herds in the\r\nintertropical and southern regions of the Pacific and Atlantic; it is\r\nseldom molested by the whalers, and is very dangerous for boats, from\r\nthe habit it has of leaping and rising suddenly to the surface. None of\r\nthe senses of the whale tribe are very acute; the whalebone whales alone\r\nhave the sense of smelling, and, although the sperm whale is immediately\r\naware of a companion being harpooned at a very great distance, they do\r\nnot hear well in air, and none have voice.[177]\r\n\r\nThe existence of creatures in the ocean resembling enormous serpents has\r\nbeen announced at different times for more than a century, but has never\r\nbeen authentically established. Accounts of such monsters having been\r\nseen in the northern seas, in the fiords of Norway and Sweden, had been\r\ngiven to the world by Egede and Pantoppidan: by the latter more on\r\nhearsay evidence than from his own observation. But, as in every\r\ninstance, the pretended sea-serpent was represented to possess either\r\nthe blow-holes of the Cetacea or the head and mane of a seal, it was\r\nevident the credulity of our Scandinavian neighbours had converted some\r\nwell-known animals into the incomprehensible marine monsters of their\r\nimagination. The same may be said of the sea-serpent represented to have\r\nbeen stranded on one of the Orkney Islands in 1808, of which a part of a\r\nskeleton is preserved in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, and\r\nwhich, when examined by the naturalist, proved to belong to a large\r\nspecies of shark; and of that fallen in with off the coast of Halifax in\r\n1833, by some British officers engaged on a fishing expedition. The\r\nexistence of the sea-serpent was looked upon therefore as one of those\r\ncreations of that imaginative credulity, so frequently entertained by\r\nignorant seafaring persons, and had ceased to attract any attention\r\nexcept occasionally by an illusion to it in some Transatlantic\r\nnewspaper; when it has been again revived by no less a person than the\r\ncommander of one of her Majesty’s ships, who has considered its\r\ndiscovery by him to be worthy of a report to the Lords of the Admiralty.\r\nThe officer in question, Captain M’Quhae, of her Majesty’s ship Dædalus,\r\nstates that, on the 6th of August, 1848, being in lat. 24° 44ʹ S., long.\r\n9° 22ʹ E., consequently not far from the south-western coast of Africa,\r\nhe descried in broad daylight, and at a short distance, an animal with\r\nthe head of a serpent and at least 60 feet long, passing his ship to the\r\nsouth-westward at the rate of 15 miles an hour. Professor Owen, after a\r\ncareful and impartial consideration of all the details given of this\r\nstrange apparition, has shown to the satisfaction of every unbiassed\r\nmind that the animals seen by the officers of the Dædalus was probably a\r\nlarge species of southern seal, and perhaps the Otaria Proboscidea. The\r\ngenus Otaria is longer in proportion than our Arctic seals, and its fore\r\nflappers being situated farther back, the neck of the animal becomes\r\nlonger, and is generally, in the act of swimming, raised out of the\r\nwater, as seen and represented by Captain M’Quhae in his drawing.\r\nProfessor Owen supposes that this seal had been carried from its usual\r\nhaunts in or near the Antarctic circle on an iceberg, which having\r\nmelted away in these middle latitudes, the animal was obliged to find\r\nits way back by its own locomotive powers; an opinion rendered the more\r\nlikely, when we consider that it was making for the nearest land, where\r\nsuch animals are known to live, Gough Island and Tristan d’Acunha, from\r\nwhich it was distant about 1500 miles, or 4 days’ journey, at the rate\r\nand in the direction it is represented by Captain M’Quhae to have been\r\nprogressing when seen from his ship. This statement of the appearance\r\ntherefore of the sea-serpent in 1848 adds nothing to our certainty as to\r\nthe existence of such monsters; whilst it shows how easy it is, for even\r\nwell-informed persons, to raise up imaginary beings out of animals\r\nwell-known to the naturalist. The general public, always fond of the\r\nmarvellous and extraordinary, is too prone to credit such stories, and\r\ntoo ready to admit the existence of beings, however opposed to all the\r\nknown laws of organic co-existences. To persons ready to give credit to\r\nthe assertions of those ignorant of the first principles of zoology, it\r\nwould be a loss of time for the naturalist to endeavour to explain how\r\nimpossible it is that the head and jaws of a serpent, with the skin and\r\nmane of a seal, and the blow-hole of a porpoise, could ever be found\r\nunited in the same animal. As well might one try to reason with a\r\nbeliever in ghosts and fairies on the non-existence of those creations\r\nof a disordered imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nDistribution of Reptiles—Frogs and Toads—Snakes, Saurians, and\r\n  Tortoises.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPTILES, more than any other class of animals, show the partial\r\ndistribution of animated beings, because, being unable to travel to any\r\ngreat distance, they have remained in the places wherein they were\r\noriginally stationed; and as they inhabit deserts, forests, and\r\nuncultivated ground, they have not been disturbed by man, who has only\r\ndestroyed some individuals, but has not diminished the number of\r\nspecies, which is probably the same as ever it was. Few of the mammalia\r\nhybernate, or fall into a torpid state in winter, except the bear,\r\nmarmot, bats, and some others. Their fat supplies the carbon consumed by\r\nthe oxygen during their feeble and imperceptible respiration, and is\r\nwasted by the time the warm weather returns, which rouses them from\r\ntheir lethargy, thin and extenuated. But reptiles, being colder-blooded,\r\nbury themselves in the ground, and hybernate during the winter in cold\r\nand temperate climates. In hot countries, they fall into a state of\r\ntorpor during the dry season, so that they have no occasion to wander,\r\neither on account of temperature or want of sustenance; and the few that\r\ndo migrate in quest of food always return to their old haunts. As the\r\nblood of reptiles receives only a small part of the oxygen they inhale,\r\nlittle heat and strength are generated; consequently they are\r\ncold-blooded, and, for the most part, sluggish in their motions, which,\r\nhowever, are more varied than in quadrupeds; but as some reptiles, such\r\nas tortoises and lizards, breathe more frequently than others, there\r\nare, consequently, great differences in their energy and sensibility.\r\n\r\nThe order of Reptiles is divided by naturalists into four classes,\r\ncommencing in the ascending order:—1. Batracians or frogs, toads, and\r\nsalamanders; 2. Ophidians or serpents; 3. Saurians, lizards, chameleons,\r\ncrocodiles; and 4. Emydians or tortoises, and turtles. With very few\r\nexceptions they are oviparous; they partake of both terrestrial and\r\naquatic forms, and many are amphibious: they all increase in numbers\r\ntowards the equator, and few live in cold climates; but they can endure\r\na cold winter better than a cool summer. Frogs and salamanders inhabit\r\nthe banks of the M’Kenzie river in North America, where the mean\r\ntemperature is between 7° and 8° of Fahrenheit; the thermometer in\r\nwinter even sinks to 90° below the freezing point. The southern limit of\r\nreptiles, so far as it is known, is in 50° S. lat., where a frog was\r\nfound on the banks of the river Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\nThe number of species of reptiles in the torrid zone is at least double\r\nthat in the temperate; Australia has fewer than Europe, and of all\r\nplaces in the Old World, Java is richest in reptiles. America possesses\r\nmore than half of all the species, the maximum being in Brazil, but\r\neveryone of them is peculiar to that continent alone.\r\n\r\nThe Batrachians approach nearest to the nature of fishes, and form a\r\nlink between land and water animals. As tadpoles they have tails and no\r\nfeet, but when full-grown they generally acquire feet and lose their\r\ntails. Besides, in that early stage they are aquatic and breathe by\r\ngills, like fishes; but in a state of maturity they breathe by lungs\r\nlike quadrupeds, though some of the genera always retain their gills and\r\ntails, and some never acquire feet. These animals have the power of\r\nretarding and accelerating their respiration without stopping the\r\ncirculation of their blood, so that they can resist heat and cold to a\r\ncertain degree—a power most remarkable in the salamander, which forms\r\npart of this class, so varied in appearance and nature. Some, as toads\r\nand frogs, imbibe a quantity of water, which is evaporated through their\r\nskin more or less quickly. This keeps them at the temperature of the\r\nmedium they live in, and the air they inhale through the skin is as\r\nnecessary to their existence as that which they breathe.\r\n\r\nThe group of toads and frogs consists of four families, which have four\r\nfeet, but without tails; namely, frogs, hylas or rainettes, toads, and\r\npipæ. Frogs, which are amphibious, have no nails on their toes, and\r\ntheir hind legs are longer than the fore, and webbed, consequently\r\nbetter fitted for swimming and jumping, which they do by leaps. There\r\nare 16 genera, and above 50 species, so that they are more numerous and\r\nmore varied than any other reptile. Of the hyla or tree-frog there are\r\n60 species, all of the most vivid and brilliant tints, and several\r\ncolours are frequently united on the same animal. They mostly live on\r\nhigh trees, and their webbed feet have little cushions at the points of\r\ntheir toes, forming a kind of sucker, by means of which they can squeeze\r\nout the air from under their feet, and, by the pressure of the\r\natmosphere, they adhere firmly to the under side of the smoothest leaf,\r\nexactly on the same principle by which flies walk on the ceiling of a\r\nroom. The bufo, or toad, is the ugliest of the race; many are hideous,\r\nwith swollen bodies, wart-like excrescences, and obtuse toes. They\r\nseldom go into water, but frequently marshy, damp places, and only\r\ncrawl, whereas the frog and hyla leap. They are much fewer than either\r\nof the other two families; only 30 species are known. The pipæ are also\r\ntoads of a still more disgusting form, and are distinguished from their\r\ncongeners by not having an extensile tongue. All these reptiles produce\r\nnoises, which are exceedingly varied; they croak in concert, following a\r\nleader, and when he is tired another takes his place. One of the North\r\nAmerican frogs croaks in bands; one band begins, another answers, and a\r\nthird replies, till the noise is heard at a great distance; a pause then\r\ntakes place, after which the croaking is renewed. Mr. Darwin mentions a\r\nlittle musical hyla at Rio de Janeiro, which croaks a kind of harmony in\r\ndifferent notes.\r\n\r\nToads and frogs are found in almost all parts of the earth, though very\r\nunequally and partially distributed. America has more than all the other\r\ncountries taken together, and Europe the fewest. Six species of frogs,\r\none rainette, and two toads, are European; and all, except four of the\r\nfrogs, are also found in Asia and Africa. The Rana temporaria lives at\r\nthe height of 7700 feet in the Pyrenees, and near the snow-line on the\r\nAlps.\r\n\r\nThe law of circumscribed distribution is strongly marked in Asia; for of\r\nten species of frogs peculiar to that continent, three only are in the\r\nmainland, two are confined to Japan, and, of the five that are Javanese,\r\none is also common to Amboina, and the other four to Bengal. The eight\r\nspecies of rainettes, or tree-frogs, are still more limited in their\r\ndomicile; five of them are in Java only, and one in Japan; and the Hyla\r\nviridis is in Asia Minor. There are nine species of toad peculiar to\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nNone of these reptiles exist in the Galapagos Archipelago, nor in any of\r\nthe innumerable islands in Oceanica, and there are very few in\r\nAustralia, but all peculiar. In Africa there are eight species of frogs,\r\ntwo or three of rainettes, and two of toads. One of the two species of\r\npipa, more horrid in appearance than any toad, is very common at the\r\nCape of Good Hope, and there only.\r\n\r\nThe great extent of marshes, rivers, and forests, together with the heat\r\nof the climate, make America the very home of reptiles of this kind, and\r\nthere they grow to a greater size than anywhere else: 23 species of\r\nfrog, 27 species of tree-frog or rainette, and 21 of toads, are\r\nindigenous in that continent, not one of which is the same with any of\r\nthose in the Old World; and most of those in South America are different\r\nfrom those in the northern part of the continent, though they are\r\nsometimes replaced by analogous kinds. All these reptiles have abodes,\r\nwith fixed demarcations, often of small extent. The pipa, or toad of\r\nSurinam, is the most horrid of the tribe; the Bufo agua, of Brazil, 10\r\nor 12 inches long, and the Rana pipiens, of Carolina, are the largest.\r\n\r\nThe second family of this class of reptiles have tails and feet, as the\r\nsalamanders, which are very like lizards in their general form, having a\r\nlong round or flattened tail and four feet. Some are terrestrial, and\r\nsome are aquatic; the former are known as salamanders or newts, the\r\nlatter as tritons. Both are met with in Europe, but the greater number\r\nare American. The amphibious genera of Amphiuma Menopoma and Syren,\r\npossessing both lungs and gills, are American; the latter are peculiar\r\nto the marshes and rice-grounds of Carolina, and the Axolotl is only\r\nfound in the Lake of Mexico: they are very like eels with two feet. The\r\nProteus anguinus, of a light flesh-colour, has four little feet and a\r\nflat tail, and has been found nowhere but in the dark subterraneous\r\ncaverns in Carniola.\r\n\r\nThe third group of this order of Batrachians are the Cæciliæ, of which\r\nthere are only eight species, all inhabitants of the warm parts of Asia,\r\nAfrica, and America. They have a cylindrical body, without feet or neck,\r\nand move exactly as the serpent, so they seem to form the link between\r\nthese reptiles and the class of frogs and toads.\r\n\r\nThere are serpents in all hot and temperate countries, but they abound\r\nmost in intertropical regions. Java contains 56 species, which is a\r\ngreater number comparatively than any other country, while in Borneo not\r\none has been found. Those in Japan are peculiar. Wherever snakes exist,\r\nthere also are some of the venomous kinds, but they are fewer,\r\nspecifically and individually, than is generally supposed. Of 263\r\nspecies, only 57 are venomous, or about one in five, although that\r\nproportion is not everywhere the same. In sterile, open countries, the\r\nproportion of venomous snakes is greater than in those that are covered\r\nwith vegetation. Thus, in New Holland, seven out of ten species are\r\npoisonous; and in Africa, one of every two or three individuals is\r\nnoxious. In general, however, the number of harmless individuals is\r\ntwenty times as great as the number of the poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe three great families of venomous serpents are the colubriform or\r\nadder-shaped snakes, sea-serpents, and the triangular-headed snakes.\r\n\r\nThe adder-formed snakes are divided into three genera, the elaps, which\r\nare slender like a cord, with a small head, and of brilliant colours.\r\nThere are four species in South America, of which two are confined to\r\nGuiana, and one to Surinam, while the other is found everywhere from\r\nBrazil to Carolina. There is only one in Africa, three in Australia, and\r\nthe rest are in limited districts in tropical Asia, especially in\r\nSumatra and Java; and an entire genus is found only in India, and the\r\nislands of Ceylon and Java. The hooded snakes (or Cobra Capello) are the\r\nbest known of this family, especially the spectacled or dancing snake of\r\nthe Indian jugglers, which is common everywhere from Malabar to Sumatra,\r\nand two other species are only found in Sumatra and Java. The three or\r\nfour African species are chiefly at the Cape of Good Hope and on the\r\nGold Coast; but the most celebrated is that generally known as the\r\nEgyptian asp, which has been tamed by magicians of ancient and modern\r\ntimes, and is frequently figured in Egyptian monuments; it derives some\r\nof its celebrity from Cleopatra’s death. Two of the family inhabit New\r\nHolland, one of which is spectacled, like, but of a different species\r\nfrom, that in India.\r\n\r\nAll the seven species of sea-snakes are very venomous, and more\r\nferocious than any other. They frequent the Indian Ocean in shoals from\r\nMalabar to the Philippine Islands and the Bay of Bengal; they never\r\nenter fresh water.\r\n\r\nThe third venomous family consists of the triangular-headed serpents,\r\nrattle-snakes, and vipers. The first are of a hideous aspect,—a large\r\nhead, broad at the base like a heart, a wide mouth, with their hooked\r\npoisonous fangs strongly developed. They quietly watch their prey till\r\nit is within reach, then dart upon it, and inflict the deadly wound in a\r\nmoment; the yellow viper of the French West India islands, the\r\nTrigonocephalus lanceolatus, being amongst the dangerous snakes in\r\nexistence. One species in the Old World is to be met with everywhere\r\nfrom Ceylon to the Phillippine Islands; one is a native in Sumatra,\r\nTimor, and Celebes; the rest are narrowly limited in their abode; two\r\nare confined to Java alone. Ceylon, Sumatra, Japan, and Tartary, have\r\neach a species of these serpents peculiar to itself.\r\n\r\nThe rattle-snakes are all American—two in the warm districts of North\r\nAmerica, and two in the intertropical parts of South America. One of the\r\nlatter, however, has a hard horn at the end of its tail, instead of a\r\nrattle, and sometimes grows to the length of 10 feet, being, with the\r\nTrigonocephalus, the longest of the venomous snakes.\r\n\r\nVipers come farther north than any other of the noxious tribe: two are\r\nAsiatic, though one is also common to Africa, which, however, has four\r\npeculiar to itself; and the only venomous serpents in Europe are three\r\nspecies of viper, one of which is also spread over the neighbouring\r\nparts of Asia and Africa. The common viper inhabits all central Europe\r\nand temperate Asia, even to Lake Baikal, in the Altaï Mountains: it is\r\nalso found in England and Sweden, but it does not go farther west than\r\nthe Seine, nor does it pass the Alps. One which frequents dry soils, in\r\nthe south-east of Europe, is in Styria, Greece, Dalmatia, and Sicily;\r\nand the aspic viper, which lives on rocky ground, inhabits France\r\nbetween the Seine and the Pyrenees, Switzerland, Italy, and Sicily.\r\n\r\nThere are six families of innocuous serpents, consisting of numerous\r\nspecies. Four of the families are terrestrial; their species are very\r\nlimited in their domicile, the greater number being confined to some of\r\nthe islands of the Indian Archipelago, Ceylon, or to circumscribed\r\ndistricts in tropical Asia, Africa, and America. Nine or ten species are\r\nEuropean, some of which are also found in Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nTree-serpents of various genera and numerous species live only in the\r\ngreat tropical forests of Asia and America, especially in the latter.\r\nThey are long and slender, the head for the most part ending in a sharp\r\npoint, and generally green, though there are some of brighter colours;\r\nmany of these serpents are fierce, though not venomous; some feed on\r\nbirds, which they watch hanging by the tail from a bough.\r\n\r\nIn all temperate and warm countries abounding in lakes and rivers,\r\nfresh-water snakes are numerous; some live in the water, but they mostly\r\ninhabit the banks near it; they are excellent swimmers, and may be seen\r\ncrossing lakes in shoals. America is particularly rich in them, there\r\nare several in Europe and Asia, but they are rare in Africa, and none\r\nhave been yet discovered in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe genus Boa is peculiarly American, though some smaller in size and\r\ndiffering in species are found in Asia. The boa constrictor, generally\r\nfrom 9 to 15 feet long, lives in the great tropical forests of South\r\nAmerica, where it often watches its prey hanging from the boughs of\r\ntrees. Two of smaller size have similar habits, and two are aquatic, one\r\nof which is sometimes 20 feet long, and another 6 feet; the latter\r\ninhabits banks of the rivers from the Amazons to Surinam; and a species\r\nis found at the foot of the Andes of Quito, as high as 3000 feet.\r\n\r\nPythons are the largest snakes of the eastern world, where they\r\nrepresent the boas of the western; one species, which sometimes attains\r\nthe length of 20 feet, is spread from the western coast of Africa,\r\nthroughout intertropical Asia, to Java and China. Another, only 14 feet\r\nlong, is confined to Malacca and some of the Sunda Islands. Two others\r\nare found only in the islands of Timor and Saparua, and one in New\r\nHolland. There are only two species of Acrochordi, which, like boas and\r\npythons, twist themselves round their victims and crush them to death:\r\none aquatic, peculiar to Java; the other is a land snake, found\r\neverywhere through India to New Guinea.\r\n\r\nThe West Indian islands have the snakes of North and South America, and\r\nsome peculiar; the snakes of central America are little known.\r\n\r\nSaurians have representatives in every warm and temperate climate. The\r\ncrocodile, from its size and ferocity, claims the first place. There are\r\nthree genera of this family, all amphibious, living in rivers, or in\r\ntheir estuaries: the Crocodile, properly speaking, common to the old and\r\nnew continents;[178] the Alligator or Caiman, peculiar to America; and\r\nthe Gavial, which comes nearer to the form of certain fossil crocodiles\r\nthan any other, is limited to the Ganges and other great rivers of\r\nIndia. The various species of crocodiles are confined to local\r\nhabitations: three are Asiatic; two African, one of which is only in\r\nSierra Leone; two are peculiar to Madagascar; and in America there are\r\ntwo species of crocodiles and five of alligators. The American\r\ncrocodiles inhabit the estuaries of great rivers, a species is to be met\r\nwith which ascends as high as 3000 feet at the base of the Andes of\r\nQuito.[179]\r\n\r\nThe alligators of the Mississippi, and of the rivers and marshes of\r\nCarolina, are more ferocious than those of South America, attacking men\r\nand animals; they only prey in the night; while in the water, like all\r\ntheir congeners, they cannot swallow their food, but they drown the\r\nanimal they have caught, hide it under water till it is putrid, and then\r\nbring it to land to eat it. Locality has considerable influence on the\r\nnature and habits of these animals; in one spot they are very dangerous,\r\nwhile in another, at no great distance, they are cowardly. Alligators\r\nare rarely more than 15 feet long, and are seen in large herds basking\r\non the banks of rivers; their cry is like the roar of a bull; in a storm\r\nthey bellow loudly, and are said to be much afraid of some of the whale\r\nfamily that ascend the great American rivers. The female watches her\r\neggs and her young for months, never losing sight of them; but the male\r\ndevours many of them when they go into the water. All animals of this\r\nclass are covered with scales; those of the crocodile family are hard,\r\nhorny, often osseous, and impenetrable.\r\n\r\nLizards are chiefly distinguished from crocodiles by having a long,\r\nthin, forked tongue like that of the viper; by their rapid motions,\r\nsmaller size, and by some peculiarities of form.\r\n\r\nThe monitors, which are entirely confined to the old continent, have the\r\ntail compressed laterally, which enables them to swim rapidly: and they\r\nare furnished with strong sharp teeth. Many species inhabit Africa and\r\nIndia, especially the Indian Archipelago: the terrestrial crocodile of\r\nHerodotus is common on the deserts which surround Egypt; and an aquatic\r\nspecies in the Nile, which devours the crocodile’s eggs, is often\r\nrepresented on the ancient Egyptian monuments.\r\n\r\nAnother group of the monitor family is peculiarly American; some of the\r\nspecies inhabiting the marshes in Guiana are 6 feet long.[180]\r\n\r\nLizards are very common; more than 63 species are European, of which 17\r\ninhabit Italy, and one lives on the Alps at an elevation of 4500 feet;\r\nthe iguanians, which differ from them only in the form of the tongue,\r\nare so numerous in genera and species, that it would be in vain to\r\nattempt to follow all their ramifications, which are nevertheless\r\ndistributed according to the same laws with other creatures: but the\r\ndragons, only found in India, are too singular to be passed over. The\r\ndragon is in fact a lizard with wings of skin, which are spread along\r\nits sides and attached to its fore and hind feet, like those of the bat,\r\nand, though they do not enable it to fly, they act like a parachute when\r\nthe animal leaps from bough to bough in pursuit of insects. Nocturnal\r\nlizards of many species inhabit the hot countries of both continents;\r\nthey are not unlike salamanders, but they have sharp claws, which they\r\ncan draw in and conceal like those of a cat, and seize their prey. One\r\nof this species, the Gecko, climbs on walls in all the countries round\r\nthe Mediterranean. Chameleons are frequent in northern Africa; and\r\nseveral species inhabit different districts and islands in Asia: the\r\nonly European species is found in Spain; it is common to North Africa.\r\n\r\nThe anolis, which lives on trees, replaces the chameleon in the hot\r\nregions of South America and in the Antilles, having the property common\r\nto chameleons of changing its colour, but it is a more nimble and\r\nbeautiful animal. In New Holland, where everything is anomalous, there\r\nis a lizard with a leaf-shaped tail.\r\n\r\nSkinks resemble serpents in form, but with four very short feet and\r\nsharp nails on their claws; they burrow in the sands of Africa and\r\nArabia: there is a species of gigantic black and yellow skink in New\r\nHolland, and those in the islands of the Indian Archipelago are green,\r\nwith blue tails.\r\n\r\nTwo anomalous saurians of the genus Amblyrhinchus were discovered by Mr.\r\nDarwin in the Galapagos Archipelago. One found only in the central\r\nislands is terrestrial, and in many places it has undermined the ground\r\nwith its burrows; the other is the only lizard known that lives on\r\nsea-weed and inhabits the sea; it is about four feet long, and hideously\r\nugly, with feet partially webbed, and a tail compressed laterally. It\r\nbasks on the beach, and in its marine habits and food it resembles, on a\r\nsmall scale, the huge monsters of a former creation.\r\n\r\nTortoises are covered with a shell or buckler, but their head, legs, and\r\ntail are free, covered with a wrinkled skin, and the animal can draw\r\nthem into the shell when alarmed. The head is sometimes defended by a\r\nregular shield, and the jaws, instead of teeth, have a horny case. The\r\nupper buckler is rounded, and formed of eight pairs of plates\r\nsymmetrically disposed, and often very beautiful; the under shell is\r\nflat, and consists of four pair of bones and one in the centre. One\r\nfamily of tortoises is terrestrial, two others are amphibious, one of\r\nwhich lives in fresh water, the other in tropical and warm seas.\r\n\r\nThere are more land tortoises in Africa than in all the rest of the\r\nworld, both specifically and individually. They abound also in the great\r\nSunda Islands, in the United States of America, South America, and\r\nespecially Brazil. There are a few European species, of which the common\r\ntortoise (Testudo Græca), which is found in all the countries round the\r\nMediterranean, is the largest, being about a foot long; it lives on\r\ninsects and vegetables, and burrows in the ground in winter. Some of the\r\nEast Indian species are enormously large, above three feet long, and\r\nremarkable for the beautiful distribution of their colours; certain\r\nspecies are peculiar to Brazil, one to Demerara, and one to North\r\nAmerica; but perhaps the largest known species is that of the Galapagos\r\nIslands, the Testudo Indicus, which attains 500 or 600 pounds in weight.\r\n\r\nThere are two families of the fresh water tortoises that live in ponds\r\nand ditches. The emys is very numerous in America; there are 15 species\r\npeculiar to the northern part of the continent, and four to the\r\nsouthern: only one has been found in Africa, two in Europe, and eight in\r\nAsia. The Emys caspia, in Asia Minor, follows a leader, and plunges into\r\nthe water when alarmed. The Chelydæ are found in the South American\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nThe trionyx, or fresh-water turtle, lives in the great rivers and lakes\r\nin warm countries; there are two species peculiar to North America; they\r\nare very large and voracious, devouring birds, reptiles, and young\r\ncrocodiles, and often are a prey to old ones. One is peculiar to the\r\nNile, one to the Euphrates; there are four species in the Ganges, which\r\nare constantly seen eating the bodies of the natives that are thrown\r\ninto the sacred stream; one of these turtles often weighs 240 pounds.\r\nThe starred trionyx is in the rivers of Java only, and another kind is\r\ncommon also to the rivers of Borneo and Sumatra.\r\n\r\nThe Chelonians, or sea-turtles, live in the seas of the torrid and\r\ntemperate zones, to the 50th parallel of latitude, some eating algæ, and\r\nothers small marine animals. Different species are found in different\r\nparts of the ocean. The green turtle, of which there are many varieties,\r\ninhabits the intertropical Atlantic; they may be seen eating sea-weed at\r\nthe bottom of the water along the coasts, and they come in great shoals\r\nto the mouths of rivers to lay their eggs in the sand from distances of\r\nmany hundred miles. This turtle is often six or seven feet long, and\r\nweighs 600 or 700 pounds; it is much esteemed for food, but the shell is\r\nof no value.\r\n\r\nThe hawk’s-bill turtle, which yields the tortoise-shell, is caught among\r\nthe Molucca Islands, and on the north-western coast of New Guinea. There\r\nis also a fishery in the western hemisphere at Haiti and the Caiman\r\nIslands, but the shell is less valuable than that from the east. There\r\nare two species in the Mediterranean, which are only valued for the oil.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the whole class of reptiles it may be observed, that not\r\none species is common to the Old and New World, and few are common to\r\nNorth and South America; those in New Holland are altogether peculiar;\r\nand, as far as is at present known, with the exception of Marianne\r\nIslands, there are neither toads, frogs, nor snakes in any of the\r\nislands of Oceanica, though the Indian Archipelago abounds in them;\r\nneither are they found in Tierra del Fuego, in the Straits of Magellan,\r\nnor in the Falkland Islands.\r\n\r\nFive species of reptiles only appear to have existed in Ireland before\r\nits geological separation from England—a lizard, a frog, a toad, and two\r\ntritons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nDistribution of Birds in the Arctic Region—In Europe, Asia, Africa,\r\n  America, and the Antarctic Regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE than 6000 species of birds are known, which are arranged in six\r\nnatural orders or groups, namely, Birds of prey—or vultures, eagles,\r\nhawks; Climbers, including parrots and woodpeckers; Songsters, the most\r\nnumerous of all the six; Gallinaceous birds, including our domestic\r\nfowls, partridges, grouse, and pheasants; Waders—herons, snipes,\r\ncurlews; and Swimmers, or web-footed birds. Next to tropical America,\r\nEurope is richest in species: the greatest number of birds of prey\r\ninhabit Europe and America, which last surpasses every country in the\r\nnumber of songsters and climbers.\r\n\r\nThere is great similarity in the birds of the northern parts of the old\r\nand new continents, and many are identical. Towards the south, the forms\r\ndiffer more and more, till in the tropical and south temperate zones of\r\nAsia, Africa, and America, they become entirely different, whole\r\nfamilies and genera often being stationary within very narrow limits.\r\nSome birds, however, are almost universal, especially birds of prey,\r\nwaders, and sea-fowl.\r\n\r\nThe bald buzzard is to be met with in every country from Europe to\r\nAustralia; the Chinese gosshawk inhabits the American continent, and\r\nevery station between China and the west coast of Europe; the peregrine\r\nfalcon lives in Europe, America, and Australia; the common and purple\r\nherons are indigenous in the old continent and the new; and the flamingo\r\nof different species fishes in almost every tropical river, and in the\r\nAndes to the height of 13,000 feet. Many of the sea-fowl also are widely\r\nspread: the wagel-gull is at home in the northern and southern oceans.\r\nCaptain Beechy’s ship was accompanied by pintadoes, or Cape pigeons,\r\nduring a voyage of 500 miles in the Pacific; and even the common\r\nhouse-sparrow is as much at home in the villages in Bengal as it is in\r\nBritain. Many more instances might be given, but they do not interfere\r\nwith the general law of special distribution.\r\n\r\nBirds migrate to very great distances in search of food, passing the\r\nwinter in one country and the summer in another, many breeding in both.\r\nIn cold climates, insects die or hybernate during winter; between the\r\ntropics they either perish or sleep in the dry season: so that, in both\r\ncases, insect-eating birds are compelled to migrate. When the ground is\r\ncovered with snow, the want of corn and seeds forces those kinds whose\r\nfood is vegetable to seek it elsewhere; and in tropical countries the\r\nannual inundations of the rivers regulate the migrations of birds that\r\nfeed on fish.\r\n\r\nSome migrate singly, some in groups, others in flocks of thousands; and,\r\nin most instances, the old and the young birds go separately. Those that\r\nfly in company generally have a leader, and such as fly in smaller\r\nnumbers observe a certain order. Wild swans fly in the form of a wedge,\r\nwild geese in a line. Some birds are silent in their flight, others\r\nutter constant cries, especially those that migrate during night, to\r\nkeep the flock together, as herons, goat-suckers, and rails.\r\n\r\nBirds of passage in confinement show the most insurmountable disquietude\r\nwhen the time of migration draws near. The Canadian duck rushes\r\nimpetuously to the north at the usual period of summer flight.\r\nRedbreasts, goldfinches, and orioles, brought from Canada to the United\r\nStates, when young, dart northwards, as if guided by the compass, as\r\nsoon as they are set at liberty. Birds return to the same place year\r\nafter year. Storks and swallows take possession of their former nests,\r\nand the times of their departure are exact even to a day. Various\r\nEuropean birds spend the winter in Asia and Africa; while many natives\r\nof these countries come to central Europe in summer.\r\n\r\nThe birds of passage in America are more numerous, both in species and\r\nindividually, than in any other country. Ducks, geese, and pigeons\r\nmigrate in myriads from the severity of the northern winters; and when\r\nthere is a failure of grain in the south, different families of birds go\r\nthe north. The Virginian partridge crosses the Delaware and goes to\r\nPennsylvania when grain is scarce in New Jersey; but it is so heavy on\r\nthe wing, that many fall into the river, and end the journey by\r\nswimming.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happens to the wild turkey, which is caught in hundreds\r\nas it arrives wet on the banks of the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi.\r\nThese birds are not fitted for long flight by their structure, because\r\ntheir bones have fewer of those air-cells which give buoyancy to the\r\nfeathered tribes. The number of air-cells is greatest in birds that have\r\nto sustain a continued and rapid flight; probably the extremes are to be\r\nmet with in the swift and the ostrich—the one ever on the wing, the\r\nother never. The strength of the ostrich is in the muscles of its legs;\r\nwhile the muscles on the breast of the swift weigh more than all the\r\nrest of the body; hence, it flies at the rate of 100 miles an hour\r\neasily. The wild duck and wild pigeon fly between 400 and 500 miles in a\r\nday. The stork, and some other migratory birds, do not halt till the end\r\nof their journey. Many sea-fowl are never seen to rest; and all the\r\neagles, vultures, and hawks are birds of strong flight, and capable of\r\nsustaining themselves at heights beyond the reach of less buoyant\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n               DISTRIBUTION OF ARCTIC AND EUROPEAN BIRDS.\r\n\r\nThe birds of Europe and North America are better known than those of any\r\npart of the globe. New species are constantly discovered in Asia,\r\nAfrica, and South America; and extensive regions in the East are yet\r\nunexplored: however, about 6000 have already been described.\r\n\r\nThere are 503 species of birds in Europe, many of which are distributed\r\nover Asia and Africa, without any apparent variation; and 100 of our\r\nEuropean species are also in North America. Of these, 90 are land-birds,\r\n28 waders, and 62 water-fowl; among which are most of the marine birds\r\nof northern Europe, which, like all sea-fowl, have a wider range.\r\n\r\nMore than three-fourths of the species, and a much larger proportion of\r\nindividuals, of the birds of Greenland, Iceland, and Feroe, are more or\r\nless aquatic, and many of the remainder are only occasional visitors. Of\r\nthe few small birds, the greater number are British; but many that\r\nreside constantly in Britain are migratory in Iceland and Feroe, and all\r\nthe small birds leave Greenland in winter. The Aquila albicilla, or\r\nfishing eagle, is the largest bird of these northern islands; it feeds\r\non salmon and trout, and builds its nest on the boldest crags. The\r\njer-falcon, or Falco Islandicus, though native, is rare even in Iceland.\r\nThe snowy owl lives near the glaciers in the interior of Greenland, and\r\nis sometimes seen in Orkney. Particular kinds of grouse are peculiar to\r\nhigh latitudes, as the ptarmigan or white grouse. The Columba æneas\r\nlives on all the rocky coasts of Europe, and it is also an American\r\nbird. The crow family are inhabitants of every part of the globe. The\r\ncommon crow is very generally distributed; the carrion-crow and jackdaw\r\nare all over Europe and North America. The Royston crow is the only one\r\nof the genus within the Arctic circle, and but a summer visitor. The\r\nmagpie is everywhere in Europe. The Jay, one of the most beautiful birds\r\nof its tribe, is found in Europe, North America, and China. The raven is\r\neverywhere, from Greenland to the Cape of Good Hope, and from Hudson’s\r\nBay to Mexico; it is capable of enduring the extremes of heat and cold,\r\nand is larger, stronger, and more ravenous in the Arctic islands than\r\nanywhere else. It is said to destroy lambs, and to drive the eider-ducks\r\nfrom their nests to take their eggs or young: they unite in flocks to\r\nchase intruding birds from their abode.\r\n\r\nWaders are more numerous than land-birds in the Arctic regions. The\r\nsnipe and the golden plover are mere visitors; and the oyster-catcher\r\nremains all the year in Iceland: it makes its nest near streams, and\r\nwages war with the crow tribe. The heron, curlew, plover, and most of\r\nthe other waders, emigrate; sand-pipers and the water-ousel remain all\r\nthe year round.\r\n\r\nWeb-footed birds, being clothed with down and oily feathers, are best\r\nable to resist the cold of a polar climate. The Cygnus musicus, or\r\nwhistling swan, is the largest migratory bird of Europe or America. It\r\nis 5 feet long from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail, and 8\r\nfeet from tip to tip of the wings: its plumage is pure white, tinged\r\norange or yellow on the head. Some of them winter in Iceland; and in the\r\nlong Arctic night their song is heard, as they pass in flocks: it is\r\nlike the notes of a violin. Various species of the duck tribe live in\r\nthe far north, in prodigious multitudes. The mallard, supposed to be the\r\norigin of our tame duck, is everywhere in the Arctic lands. There are\r\ntwo species of eider-duck: the king duck, or Somateria spectabilis, one\r\nof these, is widely dispersed over the islands and coasts of the North\r\nAtlantic, and all the Arctic land and islands in Europe and America. In\r\nEurope its most southern building-place is the Fern Islands on the\r\ncoasts of Northumberland; in America it never goes south of New York. It\r\nlives in the open sea in winter, and resorts to the coast when the grass\r\nbegins to grow. The duck makes her nest of sea-weed, lined with down\r\nfrom her breast. The islanders take the eggs and down twice in the\r\nseason; but they do not kill the old birds, because the down of a dead\r\nduck is of no value, having lost its elasticity. The third time the\r\ndrake repairs the nest with down from his breast: the birds are allowed\r\nto hatch their brood; and, as soon as the young can feed themselves,\r\nthey are taken out to sea by the duck. They attain maturity in 4 years,\r\nand then measure 2 feet from tip to tip of the wing. The same couple has\r\nbeen known to frequent a nest 20 years, and the Icelanders think the\r\neider-duck lives to 100.\r\n\r\nThe cormorant, which lives on fish, is universal in the northern seas,\r\nand is scarcely ever eaten by the natives. It sits singly, or sometimes\r\nin flocks, on the rocks, watching the fish with its keen eye: it plunges\r\nafter them, and pursues them for three or four minutes under water. Auks\r\nare very numerous, especially the razor-billed auk, or penguin; but the\r\ngreat auk, which is incapable of flight with its little wings, is now\r\nnearly extinct in the Arctic islands. The tern, or sea-swallow, is seen\r\neverywhere in these seas, skimming along the surface of the water,\r\ncatching mollusca and small fish. Gulls of many species, and in\r\ncountless numbers, are inhabitants of the Arctic regions, whilst in the\r\nAntarctic they are represented by the equally numerous genus of\r\nProcellaria, of which the Mother-Cary’s-chicken or stormy petrel is the\r\ntype. No birds are more widely dispersed than these two genera. They are\r\nat home, and brave the storm, in every latitude and in every sea; but\r\nthose in the north are said to be larger and more numerous than\r\nelsewhere. There are nine or ten species in the Arctic regions, and the\r\nmost numerous of these probably are the kittywakes, the young of which\r\ncover the rocks in Iceland, packed so close together that 50 are killed\r\nat a shot.\r\n\r\nThe skua is one of the boldest and most rapacious of birds, forming a\r\nlink between gulls and birds of prey. It lives by robbing other birds,\r\nand is so audacious that it forces the gulls to disgorge the fish they\r\nhave swallowed, and has been seen to kill a puffin at a single blow. Its\r\nhead-quarters are in Feroe, Shetland, and the Hebrides, where it hatches\r\nits brood, and attacks animals if they come near them.\r\n\r\nA few species of petrel inhabit the Arctic seas, but the South Pacific\r\nand the Antarctic seas are the favourite resort of this genus. They take\r\ntheir name from the faculty they have of walking on the water,[181]\r\nwhich they do by the aid of their flat webbed feet and widely-extended\r\nwings. The stormy petrels, consisting of several distinct species,\r\nconfounded by sailors under the name of tempest-bird or\r\nMother-Cary’s-chicken, are the most widely diffused, about the size of a\r\nswallow, and nearly of the same colour as the latter; their flight is\r\nrapid; they shelter themselves from the storm in the hollow of a wave,\r\nand go to land only at the breeding season.\r\n\r\nIt is observed that all birds living on islands fly against the wind\r\nwhen they go to sea, so as to have a fair wind when they return home\r\ntired. The direction of the prevailing winds, consequently, has great\r\ninfluence on the choice of their abode: for example, the 25 bird-rocks,\r\nor Vogel-berg, in Feroe, face the west or north-west; and no bird\r\nfrequents the cliffs facing the east, though the situation is to all\r\nappearance equally good; a preference accounted for by the prevalence of\r\nwesterly wind in these latitudes.\r\n\r\nMost marine birds are gregarious. They build their nests on the same\r\nrock, and live in society. Of this a curious instance occurs on the\r\nrocks in question. The Fugle-berg lies in a frightful chasm among the\r\ncliffs of Westmanshavn in Feroe. The chasm is encompassed by rocks 1000\r\nfeet high, and myriads of sea-fowl cluster round the top of the crags;\r\nbut different kinds have separate habitations; and no race or individual\r\nleaves his own quarters, or ventures to intrude upon his neighbours.\r\n\r\nUpon some low rocks, scarcely rising above the surface of the water,\r\nsits the glossy cormorant; the predatory skuas, on a higher shelf, are\r\nanxiously regarded by myriads of kittywakes on nests in crowded rows\r\nalong the shelving rock above, with nothing visible but the heads of the\r\nmothers almost touching one another; the auks and guillemots are seated\r\na stage higher on the narrow shelves, in order as on a parade, with\r\ntheir white breasts facing the sea, and in absolute contact. The puffins\r\nform the summit of this feathered pyramid, perched on the highest\r\nstation, and scarcely discernible from its height, if they did not\r\nbetray themselves by flying backwards and forwards. Some of these tribes\r\nhave a watch posted to look out for their safety; and such confidence\r\nhas the flock in his vigilance, that if he is taken the rest are easily\r\ncaught. When the whole take flight, the ear is stunned by their\r\ndiscordant screams.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the marine birds of the Arctic seas are inhabitants\r\nalso of the northern coasts of the continent of Europe and of the\r\nBritish islands.\r\n\r\nNo part of Europe is richer in birds than Britain, both in species and\r\nnumbers of individuals; and the larger game is so abundant, that no one\r\nthinks of eating nightingales and redbreasts. Of the 503 species of\r\nEuropean birds, 277 are native in our islands. The common grouse, the\r\nyellow and pied wagtails, and the English starling, are found nowhere\r\nelse. It is probable that most of the British birds came from Germany\r\nbefore the separation of our island from the continent, and many of\r\nshort flight never reached Ireland. The ptarmigan and capercailzie came\r\nfrom Norway.\r\n\r\nThere are five European vultures: the lemmergeyer of the Alps and\r\nPyrenees builds its nest in the most inaccessible parts of the\r\nmountains, and is seldom seen; it lives also in the mountains of\r\nAbyssinia and on the Mongolian steppes. Ten eagles are European; one is\r\npeculiar to Sardinia; and several of them are common in America: the\r\ngolden eagle is one; that beautiful bird, which once gave a\r\ncharacteristic wildness to our Scotch mountains, and the distinguishing\r\nfeather to the bonnet of our chieftains, is now nearly extirpated. The\r\nosprey or fishing eagle is equally an inhabitant of Europe and America,\r\nand so are some of our numerous hawks; among others the jer or gentil\r\nfalcon has been so much destroyed, that it is now rare even in Iceland,\r\nits native place: there are still a few in Scotland, and several are\r\ncaught in their migratory flight over the Low Countries, and reclaimed\r\nby the expert falconers for the now nearly obsolete sport of falconry.\r\n\r\nThe owl tribe is numerous, and many of them are very handsome. The Bubo\r\nmaximus, the great owl, the largest of nocturnal birds, inhabits the\r\nforests of middle and southern Europe; it is rare in France and England,\r\nthough not uncommon in Ireland and Orkney: in Italy a small owl is tamed\r\nand used as a decoy.\r\n\r\nOwls, eagles, and hawks, have representatives in every country, but of\r\ndifferent species. The two species of European Goatsuckers migrate to\r\nAfrica in winter; their peculiar cry may be heard on a moonlight night\r\nwhen a large flock takes wing for the journey. Several of our swallows\r\ngo to Africa: both our kingfishers are African, and only visit us in\r\nsummer; one, the Alcedo ispida, is a native of Lower Egypt and the\r\nshores of the Red Sea. Some of the 7 species of European creeping birds,\r\nor certhias, creep on the trunks and branches of trees in search of\r\ninsects; others pursue their prey clinging to the face of rocks and\r\nwalls, supported by the stiff elastic feathers of the tail: the hoopoe,\r\nan inhabitant of southern Europe, is also a creeper, but it pursues\r\nsmall reptiles and insects on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Fringillæ or thick-billed birds are by much the most characteristic\r\nof Europe; to them belong our finest songsters. The sylvias have soft\r\nbeaks, and feed on insects and worms; the nightingale, the redbreast,\r\nthe wren, the smallest of European birds, the warblers, white-throat,\r\nand others, are of this family Thick-billed birds live on seed, as the\r\ncommon sparrow, the gold, and other finches, linnets, buntings, and\r\ncrossbeaks.\r\n\r\nFour species of fly-catchers are peculiar to Europe, and five species of\r\nshrikes. Ravens, crows, jays, and magpies are everywhere; the Alpine\r\ncrow and nutcracker are found in central Europe only. Compared with\r\nAmerica the starling family is poor, and the woodpecker race still more\r\nso, yet we have six species, some of which are very beautiful. There is\r\nonly one cuckoo entirely European, the other two kinds only come\r\naccidentally, and all are birds of passage. There are four species of\r\nthe pigeon tribe; the ringdove frequents the larch forests, and is\r\nmigratory; the stockdove also leaves us in October; the biset or rock\r\npigeon, supposed to be the origin from which the infinite variety of our\r\ndomestic pigeons has sprung, flies in flocks, and makes its flimsy nest\r\non trees and rocks; it is also found in the Da-ouria part of the Altaï\r\nchain. Of gallinaceous birds there are many; the only native pheasant is\r\nin the south-western parts of the continent; and the capercailzie,\r\nextinct in the British forests, inhabits many parts of Europe; in\r\nScandinavia especially it is plentiful as far as the pine-tree grows,\r\nwhich is nearly to North Cape, and also in the Russian forests. The\r\nhazel grouse frequents the pine and aspen forests in central and\r\nnorthern Europe, where the black cock also is plentiful. Five species of\r\ngrouse and six of partridges afford abundance of game; four of the\r\nlatter are confined to the southern parts of the continent, and so are\r\nthe sand and pentailed grouse, which form a separate family; the former\r\ninhabits the sterile plains of Andalusia and Granada, and the latter the\r\nstony uncultivated parts of France, southern Italy, and Sicily. The\r\nOrtigis Gibraltarica is a peculiar bird allied to the grouse family,\r\nfound in the south of Europe only.\r\n\r\nEuropean waders are very numerous, and among them there are specimens of\r\nall the genera; woodcocks, snipes, plovers, curlews, and grebes, are\r\nvery abundant, and herons of various species; three of them are egrets\r\nor crested herons, and the common heron now assembles on the tops of\r\ntrees unmolested, since the progress of agriculture has rendered the\r\ncountry unfit for hawking. Several cranes and storks, and two species of\r\nibis, are European: a species of flamingo is met with in the\r\nsouth-eastern parts of the continent, and in the maremme on the east\r\ncoast of Italy. Many of the waders, however, migrate in winter. The\r\nstork, so great a favourite in Holland that it is specially protected,\r\nis a wanderer; it retires to Asia Minor, and on the return of summer\r\nresumes its old nest on a chimney-top, breeding in both countries. About\r\n139 species of European birds either live in the more elevated parts of\r\nthe Alps, or cross them in their annual migrations. They generally take\r\ntheir flight by the great St. Bernard, the pass of St. Theodule, the\r\nSimplon, and St. Gothard. Europe is particularly rich in web-footed\r\nbirds; there are three species of wild swans, four of wild geese, and\r\nmore than 30 of the duck tribe, including the inhabitants of the Arctic\r\nseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n               BIRDS OF ASIA AND THE INDIAN ARCHIPELAGO.\r\n\r\nEuropean birds are widely spread over Asia; most of the Arctic sea-fowl\r\nfrequent its northern coasts: between 50 and 60 European birds are also\r\nSiberian, and there are above 70 European species in Japan and Corea,\r\nwhich probably are also inhabitants of Siberia and the Altaï Mountains,\r\nand several are identical with the birds of North America; so that the\r\nsame affinity prevails in the feathery tribes of the Arctic regions as\r\nin the vegetable productions.\r\n\r\nAsia Minor is a country of transition, and many European birds are mixed\r\nwith those of warmer regions, as the Halcyon smyrnensis, a large bird\r\nwith gorgeous plumage, identical with the great Bengal kingfisher,\r\ngeneral throughout India. European birds also inhabit the Caucasus, the\r\nshores of the Caspian Sea, and Persia. Moreover, these warmer climates\r\nare the winter-quarters of various European species.\r\n\r\nIn Asia Minor, and especially in Armenia, the number and variety of\r\nbirds is very great; large eagles, vultures, falcons, buzzards, quails,\r\npartridges, starlings, herons, storks, cranes, legions of Arctic grebes,\r\nswans, wild geese, ducks, and pelicans, are natives of these countries;\r\nbesides singing-birds, the nightingale, the constant theme of the poet’s\r\nsong, abounds in Persia: hawks are trained for hunting deer in that\r\ncountry, and the Asiatic partridges, or francolins, more vividly\r\ncoloured than ours, differ also in having beaks fitted for digging up\r\nbulbous roots, which is their food in the deserts.\r\n\r\nFarther east the types become more Indian; the great peninsulas on each\r\nside of the Ganges are the habitations of the most peculiar and the most\r\ngorgeous of birds. Many species, and some entire genera, of kingfishers\r\nare here, of the gaudiest colouring; the plumage of the fly-catchers has\r\nthe richest metallic lustre; and the shrikes, of a sober hue with us,\r\nare there decked in the brightest colours; the drongo has a coat of\r\nultramarine, and the calyptomene has one of emerald green.\r\n\r\nThe large-beaked climbing-birds are singularly handsome. The great green\r\nparrot, so easily taught to speak, has inhabited the Indian forests and\r\nthe banks of the Ganges time out of mind, with a host of congeners of\r\nevery colour; not one species of these, or indeed of the whole parrot\r\ntribe, is common to Asia, Africa, America, or Australia, nor even to any\r\ntwo of these great continents. They are vividly coloured in India, but\r\nthe cuckoo tribe rivals them; several genera of these birds exist\r\nnowhere else, as the large-beaked Malcahos, the Coucals with their stiff\r\nfeathers, and the Couroucous or Trogons, dressed in vermilion and gold;\r\nthe last, however, also inhabit other tropical climates.\r\n\r\nEastern Asia is distinguished by the variety of its gallinaceous birds\r\nand the gorgeousness of their plumage. To this country we owe our\r\ndomestic fowls; and two species of peacock are wild in the woods of\r\nIndia and Ceylon. The Polyplectron, the only bird of its kind, and the\r\nTragopons, are Indian; and some of the most brilliant birds of the East\r\nare among the pheasant tribe, of which five species are peculiar to\r\nChina and Tibet. There are various species of the pheasant in the\r\nHimalaya, and one whose feathers have a metallic lustre. The gold, the\r\nsilver, and Reeves’ pheasant, the tail-feathers of which are four feet\r\nlong, belong to China. The Lophophorus refulgens, and some others of\r\nthat genus, are altogether Indian.\r\n\r\nThe pigeons also are very splendid in their plumage; they mostly belong\r\nto China and Japan; those in the Birman empire are green.\r\n\r\nIt would be vain to enumerate the fine birds that range in the forests,\r\nor fish in the rivers, of the Asiatic continent, yet the birds of the\r\nIndian Archipelago far surpass them in splendour of plumage; these\r\nislands indeed are the abode of the most gorgeously arrayed birds in\r\nexistence. Even in Java and Sumatra, though most similar to India in\r\ntheir winged inhabitants, there are many peculiar, especially 12 or 13\r\nspecies of the climbing tribe, and several of the honey-sucking kind;\r\nbut the dissimilarity increases with the distance, as in New Guinea and\r\nits islands, where the honey-sucking genera are developed in novel forms\r\nand sumptuous plumage.\r\n\r\nIn the various islands of the archipelago there are altogether at least\r\n15 genera, with their numerous species, found there only. There are the\r\nCassicans, which resemble jays, with plumage of metallic lustre; the\r\nonly two species of Pirolls, one bright violet, the other of brilliant\r\ngreen; various species of Buceros with large horned beaks, Orioles of\r\nvivid colours, the swallow that builds the edible nest, the most\r\nnumerous and splendid Sylvias, and all the species but one of the\r\nPhiledons or honey-sucking birds with tongues that end in a brush. Birds\r\nof Paradise of many kinds inhabit New Guinea and the neighbouring\r\nMoluccas and Aroo Islands. They are birds of passage, and change their\r\nquarters with the monsoon. The king bird of paradise has two long\r\nslender filaments from the tail, ending in a curled flat web of emerald\r\ngreen, and the male of the green species has long flowing plumes from\r\nthe sides of his body, which give him a magnificent appearance. The\r\npigeons are peculiarly beautiful and numerous, but limited in their\r\nabode. The Gouroa, or great crowned pigeon, the largest of its tribe, is\r\nan inhabitant of Borneo. Each island has its own species of Louries,\r\nwhich exist nowhere else; many peculiar paroquets and cockatoos,\r\ncouroucous or trogons, coucals, and the barbu, with huge beaks, are all\r\npeculiar to these islands. Even the partridges have thrown aside their\r\ngrave colours and assumed the vivid hues of the tropics, as the green\r\nand tufted Cryptonyx. But the other gallinaceous birds far surpass them,\r\nas the fire and the Argus pheasant, and two or three species still more\r\nsplendid, with a host of other birds already known, and multitudes which\r\nEuropeans never have seen, in the deep jungles and impenetrable forests\r\nof these unexplored islands. The Cassowary, a bird akin to the ostrich,\r\nwithout the power of flying, but fleet in its course, has a wide range\r\nin the Indian Archipelago and the south-eastern peninsula of Asia, and,\r\nthough destitute of beauty, is interesting from its peculiar location\r\nand the character of the whole race.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AFRICAN BIRDS.\r\n\r\nA great number of European birds are also inhabitants of Africa, and\r\nmany migrate there in winter, yet the birds of this continent are very\r\npeculiar and characteristic; those in the north and north-east, and at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, are best known, but the greater part of tropical\r\nAfrica is still unexplored. It may be observed, generally, that the\r\ntropical birds differ from those of north Africa, but are, with a few\r\nexceptions, the same with those in the southern part of the continent,\r\nand the whole of Africa, south of the desert, differs in species from\r\nthose of north and western Africa and from Europe. Moreover, there is a\r\nstrong analogy, though no affinity, between the birds of Africa and\r\nAmerica in the same parallels of latitude; there is not a single\r\nperching bird common to the two, though some of the rapacious are in\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nThere are 59 species of birds of prey, of which a few are also European.\r\nThe Secretary-bird is the most singular of this order: it preys upon\r\nserpents at the Cape of Good Hope, in Abyssinia, and other parts of the\r\ncontinent. Africa possesses at least 300 species of the passerine order,\r\nof which 10 genera, with all their species, are peculiarly its own. The\r\nswallows are more beautiful than ours, especially the Cecropis striata,\r\nwith two tail-feathers twice as long as its body. Many kingfishers, the\r\nmost beautifully coloured of their brilliant race, frequent the lakes\r\nand rivers: four species of Hoopoes, one of which visits Europe in\r\nsummer, are natives; and the honey-birds, the representatives of the\r\nhumming-birds of South America, are peculiarly African. They abound at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, where the nectaries of proteas and other plants\r\nproduce the sacccharine juice which is their food. The Malurus\r\nAfricanus, and many other singing-birds, for the most part unknown\r\nelsewhere, inhabit the forests. The canary-bird is confined to the\r\nCanary Islands; its song differs even in two adjacent districts: there\r\nare, however, other instances of this. The Capirote, also indigenous in\r\nthe Canary Islands, is a finer songster, but it cannot be tamed. Various\r\nshrikes are peculiar to Africa, but the species known as the grand\r\nBaratra is confined to the Azores. There are several birds of the raven\r\ntribe, or nearly akin to them: as the Lampratornis superba; another with\r\npurple wings, the Buphaga, the only bird of its genus; and several\r\nspecies of the Calaos. The weaving-bird, or Loxia textor, is one of the\r\nmost remarkable of the graminivorous tribe; it weaves its nest with\r\ngrass and twigs very dexterously; one brought to Europe wove a quantity\r\nof thread among the wires of its cage, with great assiduity, into a\r\nstrong texture. The Widow-bird, the Calious, the blue bee-eater, and all\r\nthe fly-catching touracous, with many species of woodpeckers, are found\r\nnowhere else. The parrots and paroquets, which swarm in the tropical\r\nforests, from the size of a hen to that of a sparrow, are of original\r\nforms. The Trogons, or Couroucous, the most beautiful of the\r\nlarge-beaked climbing-birds, are the same as in Asia; but the Barbu and\r\nthe four species of Barbicans are altogether African, and so are some of\r\nthe cuckoos. Among the latter are two species of the Cuculus indicator,\r\nso named from indicating where the bees have their nests; one is\r\npeculiar to Abyssinia, the other to the interior at the Cape of Good\r\nHope; and mocking-birds are spread over a wide extent of this continent.\r\n\r\nThere are at least 13 species of African pigeons; and to Africa we are\r\nindebted for the guinea-fowl, of which there are three or four kinds: it\r\nwanders in flocks of hundreds among the brushwood on the banks of rivers\r\nand lakes in Numidia and all the tropical regions, and they are even\r\nmore abundant in Madagascar. Many grouse and partridges are peculiar,\r\nespecially the Gangas, of which there are five species; some go in\r\ncoveys, and others traverse the deserts in flocks of many hundreds. The\r\nsand-grouse, one of this family, is much more abundant on the arid\r\ndeserts of north Africa than in Europe; and the partridges of this\r\ncountry are francolins, which feed on bulbous roots.\r\n\r\nThe Ostrich takes the wide range of Africa and Arabia; the bird of the\r\ndesert, and bustards, also wanderers in the plains, are numerous: the\r\nmost peculiar are the rhaad and the Otis kori, in south Africa, five\r\nfeet high, and remarkable for the brilliancy of its eye.\r\n\r\nWaders of infinite variety inhabit the rivers, lakes, and marshes—\r\nwoodcocks, snipes, plovers, storks, cranes, herons, and spoonbills. The\r\nmost peculiar are the Dromes and Marabous, whose feathers form a\r\nconsiderable article of commerce; the cream-coloured plover, the Scorpus\r\nor ombrette, the water-treader of Abyssinia, and the Tantalus tribe,\r\namong which is the ibis (Tantalus ibis), held sacred by the ancient\r\nEgyptians, so frequently found in mummies in the catacombs, and\r\nrepresented on their monuments.\r\n\r\nSwimming-birds are no less numerous: the Bernicla cyanaptera is a goose\r\npeculiar to Shoa; the rhynchops and pelicans, several of the duck kind,\r\nor birds allied to them, are found nowhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nOf 471 species of North American birds, about 100 are also found in\r\nEurope, the greater number of which are water-fowl, and those common to\r\nthe northern coasts of both continents. The sea-fowl on the North\r\nPacific and Behring’s Straits are very much the same with those in the\r\nGreenland seas and the North Atlantic, but the great Auk or penguin,\r\nwith featherless wings, still exists on the North Pacific, and the large\r\nwhite albatross, seldom seen in the North Atlantic, frequents Behring’s\r\nStraits and the western coasts of North America in immense flocks. It is\r\nalmost universal in the Pacific and in the stormy regions towards the\r\nsouthern pole. Like the Mother-Cary’s-chicken, it is a bird of the\r\ntempest, sailing calmly on its huge wings in the most tremendous gales,\r\nand following a ship a whole day without resting on the waves: it is the\r\nlargest of winged sea-fowls; some measure 14 feet from tip to tip of the\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThere is no vulture common to the two continents, but there are five\r\neagles, half of the other birds of prey, a fourth part of the crow\r\ntribe, several waders and web-footed birds which inhabit both; yet the\r\ngeneral character of North American birds is different from that of\r\nEuropean: 81 American generic forms and two families are not found in\r\nEurope. The humming-birds are altogether American; only four species are\r\nin North America; one of these is migratory, and another is common to\r\nSouth America. The parrot family, distributed with generic differences\r\nin almost all tropical countries, has but one representative here, which\r\nlives in the forests of the Carolinas. Europe has nothing analogous to\r\nthese two families. It is singular that a country with so many rivers\r\nand lakes should possess only one kingfisher. The woods are filled with\r\nmany species of creeping birds, and there are 68 peculiar species of\r\nsylvias and fly-catchers; among others the Todus viridis, which forms a\r\ngenus by itself. Ravens, crows, pies, and jays abound, and there are 13\r\nspecies of starlings. The finch tribe are very numerous, and there are\r\n16 species of woodpeckers, as might be expected in a country covered\r\nwith forests. Of pigeons there are eight species, but individually they\r\nare innumerable, especially the Columba migratoria, which passes over\r\nCanada and the northern States in myriads for successive days twice in\r\nthe year. The poultry-yard is indebted to North America for the domestic\r\nturkey, which there ranges wild in its native woods, and attains great\r\nsize. There are no partridges, properly speaking, and of 13 American\r\nspecies of grouse, three are probably European, a family which exists in\r\nevery country under different forms. The vast expanse of water and\r\nmarshy ground makes North America the home of water-fowl and waders\r\nwithout end. Most of the waders and graminivorous birds are migratory;\r\nin winter they find no food north of the great lakes, where the ground\r\nis frozen upwards of six months in the year. Many pass the winter in\r\nCalifornia, as storks and cranes; wild geese cover acres of ground near\r\nthe sea, and when they take wing their clang is heard far off. Even\r\ngulls and other northern sea-fowl come to the coasts of California, and\r\nindeed to the shores of all the north and temperate Pacific.\r\n\r\nIt may be said generally that, with regard to the web-footed tribe,\r\nNorth America possesses specimens of all the genera of the old world,\r\nand many peculiarly its own. The table-land of Mexico has some peculiar\r\nforms, and some species of swimming-birds found only in more northern\r\nlatitudes; but, except the Ampelidæ, there are representatives of every\r\ngroup of North and South America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BIRDS OF SOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nThe tenants of the air in South America differ more from those in North\r\nAmerica than these do from the birds of Europe: there are not more than\r\n50 or 60 species in common. South America has a greater variety of\r\noriginal forms than any other country; more than 25 genera, with all\r\ntheir species, inhabit that country only; of the passerine family alone\r\nthere are at least 1000 species, all peculiar to it. The vultures are of\r\ndifferent genera from those in Europe; the Condor of the Andes is the\r\nlargest of these; it frequents the highest pinnacles of the Andes in\r\nsummer, and builds its nest at the height of 15,000 feet and more above\r\nthe sea; and Baron Humboldt saw it wheeling in circles at the elevation\r\nof 22,000 feet. It inhabits the Andes from the Straits of Magellan to 7°\r\nN. lat., but it never crosses the isthmus of Panama, the condor of\r\nCalifornia being a smaller bird. It roams over the plains of Patagonia\r\neven to the mouth of the Rio Negro, and in winter it descends in groups\r\nto feed on the plains and sea-shore; and, like all the vulture race, it\r\npossesses the faculty of descrying a dead or dying animal from a very\r\ngreat distance. Although the condor lives principally on dead animals\r\nand carrion, it will sometimes attack live animals; its habits are those\r\nof our ordinary vulture; much exaggeration has found its way into books\r\nas to its size and ferocity; the most remarkable point in its history is\r\nthe great vertical extent in which it is known to live, from the level\r\nof the sea, to an elevation of 22,000 feet. The Vultur papa, or king of\r\nthe vultures, an inhabitant of the tropical regions, is remarkable for\r\nthe bright blue and vermilion colour of the head and neck; the black\r\nvulture lives in large assemblages on the tops of high trees in the\r\nsylvas of Brazil; another numerous species prey on animals in the\r\nllanos. Many other rapacious birds are peculiar to this continent; the\r\nburrowing owl, so common in the Pampas and Chile, is one of these. The\r\nGuachero forms a genus by itself; it is of the size of a common fowl,\r\nwith the form and beak of a vulture, and is the only instance known of a\r\nnocturnal bird feeding on fruit. It is confined to a limited district in\r\nthe province of Cumana, and shuns the day; incredible numbers have taken\r\npossession of a dark cavern in the valley of Caripe, where they are\r\nkilled in thousands every year by the Indians for their fat.\r\n\r\nThe Troupials represent our Orioles, the Baratras and Becardes our\r\nshrikes, while the Tangaras partake of the form both of the shrike and\r\npie, which last, with all the rest of the crow family, have various\r\nrepresentatives in this country. Swallows, or birds allied to them, are\r\nnumerous, and many that live on the honeyed juice of flowers, like the\r\nhumming-bird, so peculiarly characteristic of South America: 150 species\r\nof humming-birds, from the size of a wren to that of an humble-bee,\r\nadorn the tropical regions of Brazil and Guiana. This family, so\r\nentirely American, has a range from the Straits of Magellan to the 38th\r\nparallel of N. lat.: it may be met with in the forests on the mountain\r\nof Orizaba, at an elevation of 11,000 feet above the sea; and some\r\nbeautiful species of it at still greater heights in the Andes of Bolivia\r\nand New Grenada. There is only one South American humming-bird which is\r\nalso permanent in the United States, and only two are found in Central\r\nAmerica: many of them are migratory; they come in multitudes to north\r\nChile in summer, and disappear in winter. The climbing-birds, with large\r\nbills, are mostly confined to the tropical forests, which swarm with\r\npeculiar races of parrots, paroquets, and macaws. It is a remarkable\r\ncircumstance in the distribution of birds that there should be 40\r\nspecies of parrots in the torrid zone of America, and only three species\r\non the opposite coast of Africa, though the climate is similar and the\r\nvegetation nearly as luxuriant. Parrots range from the Straits of\r\nMagellan to the 42d parallel of N. lat.; where the Eider-duck, which is\r\na peculiarly Arctic bird, begins. There are whole families of birds in\r\ntropical America not to be seen elsewhere: as the vividly-coloured\r\nToucan, with its huge beak; the Araucari, which lives on the fruit of\r\nthe Araucaria; some peculiar species of the gorgeous trogons or\r\ncouroucous; the Tomalias, birds related to the cuckoo tribe; and the\r\nJacmars, which represent the woodpeckers.\r\n\r\nThe gallinaceous family is totally different from that of the North\r\nAmerican forests; the Guan or penelope represents our pheasants, the\r\ndifferent species of Crax or Alectors the wild turkey, which they equal\r\nin size and brilliancy of plumage; whilst the numerous species of\r\nTinamous and cognate genera fill the place of the grouse, quails, and\r\npartridges of the old continent. South America furnishes two species of\r\ngallinaceous birds of a very peculiar character—the Cariama of Brazil,\r\nlike to the secretary-bird of the Cape of Good Hope in its form and its\r\nhabits of destroying reptiles; and the Kamichi, which possesses one or\r\nmore sharp triangular spurs at the point of each wing, a dreadful\r\ninstrument of attack and defence, such as is possessed by no other bird.\r\n\r\nThe three-toed or American ostrich, or Struthio Rhea, ranges, like all\r\nits congeners, over a wide extent of country. It is found from the\r\nsilvas of Brazil to the Rio Negro, which bounds the Pampas of Buenos\r\nAyres on the south, and in some of the elevated plains of the\r\nPeru-Bolivian Cordilleras; while the Struthio Darwinii has the plains of\r\nPatagonia to the Straits of Magellan for its residence.\r\n\r\nThe water-fowl and waders in this land of rivers are beyond number;\r\nmillions of flamingoes, spatules, cormorants, herons, fishing falcons,\r\nand scissor-beaks, follow the fish that go up the rivers to spawn; nor\r\nare gulls wanting where fish are to be found: a little snow-white heron\r\nwalks on the back and over the head of the crocodile while it sleeps.\r\nThe water-fowl are almost all peculiar; the few that are excepted are\r\nNorth American. Eight or nine genera belonging to the warm climates of\r\nthe old world are here under new forms, and the number of specific forms\r\nof the same genus is greater than in any other country. The beautiful\r\nred Ibis or Tantalus ruber inhabits Cayenne; the Ardea helias and\r\nscolopax are the most beautiful of the heron tribe, from their\r\nvariegated plumage.\r\n\r\nDucks migrate in immense flocks, alternately between the Orinoco and the\r\nAmazons, on account of the greater supply of fish afforded by the floods\r\nof these rivers, which take place at intervals of six months from each\r\nother. Between the tropics the vicissitudes of drought and humidity have\r\nmuch influence on the migration of birds, because the supply of their\r\nfood depends upon these changes.\r\n\r\nIf anything more were required to show the partial location of birds,\r\nthe Galapagos Archipelago might be mentioned: of 26 specimens shot by\r\nMr. Darwin, 25 were peculiar, though bearing a strong resemblance to\r\nAmerican types; some birds were even confined to particular islands; and\r\nthe gulls, one of the most widely dispersed families, are peculiar. But\r\non this comparatively recent volcanic group, only 500 miles distant from\r\nthe coast of America, everything is peculiar—birds, plants, reptiles,\r\nand fish; and though under the equator, none have brilliant colours.\r\n\r\nThe coasts of Peru and northern Chile are not rich in birds, but in\r\nsouthern Chile there are many humming-birds, parrots, flamingoes,\r\npeculiar ducks and geese; and there commences that inconceivable\r\nquantity of sea-fowl that swarm on the seas and coasts of the Antarctic\r\nregions. The black scissor-bill, or Rhynchops nigra, has been seen to\r\nform a dense mass seven miles long; shags fly in an unbroken line two\r\nmiles. Pelicans, terns, petrels, and many others, cover the low islands\r\nand coasts of the mainland, and those of Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\nIn the Antarctic and Southern seas Petrels take the place of our gulls;\r\nseven species of them inhabit these high southern latitudes in\r\nprodigious numbers. Two remarkable species of this genus are found\r\nthroughout the Southern Ocean—the Giant Petrel (P. gigantea), equal to\r\nthe albatross in size, and resembling it in its mode of life—it\r\nsometimes becomes perfectly white; and the Equinoctial Petrel (P.\r\nequinoctialis), a beautiful bird as large as our domestic fowl, and of a\r\njet black colour. A flock of what was supposed to be the young of the\r\nspecies known as the Pintado or Cape pigeon (Procellaria capensis) was\r\nestimated to have been from six to ten miles long, and two or three\r\nmiles broad, absolutely darkening the air during the two or three hours\r\nthey were flying over the Discovery ships. The snowy petrel, a most\r\nelegant bird, never leaves the ice, and consequently is never seen north\r\nof the Antarctic circle in summer. Three species of the southern Penguin\r\n(Aptenodytes) inhabit these seas; the A. Patachonica, the largest of\r\nsea-fowls, is a rare and, for the most part, solitary bird, lives on the\r\npack ice, and weighs from 60 to 70 pounds. The other two species are\r\nsmaller and gregarious; they crowd the snow-clad islands in the high\r\nsouthern latitudes in myriads; every ledge of rock swarms with them, and\r\non the shore of Possession Island, close to Victoria Land, it was\r\ndifficult to pass through the multitudes. They are fine, bold birds,\r\npecking and snapping with their sharp bills at those who venture among\r\nthem. They can scarcely walk, and, their wings being merely rudimentary,\r\nthey cannot fly; they skim along the snow, and swim rapidly, even under\r\nwater, resembling more a fish or a seal than a bird in their movements,\r\nand the noise they make baffles all description. Two species of\r\nalbatross breed in the Antarctic islands; a kind of skua gull, which\r\nrobs their nests; and a goose which, like the eider-duck, makes its nest\r\nwith the down from its breast. A very curious bird, forming as it were a\r\npassage between the gallinaceous birds and waders, the Chionis or\r\nVaginalis Alba, is only found near the southern extremity of this\r\ncontinent: it is of a milky white, and of the size of our domestic\r\npigeon, and often takes refuge on the yards of ships off Cape Horn and\r\nStaten Land; it lives chiefly on a small species of cuttle-fish. Few\r\nland birds are met with within the Antarctic circle: there are but seven\r\nor eight species in the Auckland Islands, mostly New Zealand birds;\r\namong others, the tooa or tui, and an olive-coloured creeper, the\r\nchoristers of the woods. One only was found in Campbell Island.\r\n\r\nMany generic forms are the same at the two extremities of the globe, yet\r\nwith distinct specific differences. Sea-fowls are more excursive than\r\nother birds, but even they confine themselves within definite limits, so\r\nthat the coasts may be known from their winged inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AUSTRALIAN BIRDS.\r\n\r\nThe Australian birds are, in many respects, as singular as the\r\nquadrupeds and plants of that country: a white falcon is among its birds\r\nof prey, a black swan among its water-fowl, and of 45 genera, 35 are\r\npurely Australian. The passeres are so original, that many new genera\r\nhave been found. The Cassican, a handsome bird of bright colours,\r\napproaching somewhat to the crow family, the Choucalcyon, the golden and\r\nblack oriole, and one species of Philedon, are peculiarly Australian.\r\nThe Menura superba, or lyre-bird, from the resemblance its outspread\r\ntail bears to the form of the ancient lyre, is the only bird of its\r\ngenus, and the only one which approaches the character of the\r\ngallinaceous family, of which none have been discovered in the\r\nAustralian continent. Here are many specific kinds of cuckoos, as the\r\nCoucal and the Scythrops, the only bird of that genera. Woodpeckers\r\nthere are none. The parrots, paroquets, and cockatoos, which live in\r\nnumerous societies, are all peculiar, especially the black cockatoo,\r\nwhich is found here only; it is not so gregarious, but even more\r\nsuspicious than the white cockatoos, which have a sentinel to warn them\r\nof danger. Chious, with huge bills like the toucan satin-birds, pigeons\r\nand doves of peculiar forms, abound; and the Cereopsis goose is no less\r\npeculiar among the web-footed tribe. The desert plains of this great\r\ncontinent are allotted to the Emu, a large struthious bird, like its\r\ncongener the cassowary incapable of flight, and once very plentiful, but\r\nnow in progress of being extirpated or driven by the colonists to the\r\nunexplored regions of the interior.\r\n\r\nThe Apteryx, a bird of the same family, still lingers in New Zealand,\r\nbut it is on the verge of extinction, and probably owes its existence to\r\nits nocturnal and burrowing habits. It is one of those anomalous\r\ncreatures that partakes of the character of several others; its head is\r\nin shape something like that of the ibis, with a long slender bill,\r\nfitted for digging into the ground for worms and grubs; its legs and\r\nfeet resemble those of the common fowl, with a fourth toe or spur\r\nbehind, in which it differs from its congeners; and its wings, if wings\r\nthey can be called, are exceedingly small. In a specimen, whose body\r\nmeasured 19 inches, the wings, stripped of the feathers, were only an\r\ninch and a half long, ending in a hard horny claw three inches long. The\r\ncomparatively small wings are characteristic of the whole family: the\r\nrhea and ostrich have the largest, which, though unavailing in flight,\r\nmaterially aid their progress in running; the wings of the emu and\r\napteryx serve only as weapons of defence: the whole tribe also defend\r\nthemselves by kicking. No animals have a more remarkable geographical\r\ndistribution than this family, or show more distinctly the decided\r\nlimits within which animals have originally been placed. These huge\r\nbirds can neither fly nor swim, consequently they could not have passed\r\nthrough the air or the ocean to distant continents and islands. There\r\nare five distinct genera, to each of which very extensive and widely\r\nseparated countries have been allotted: the Ostrich is spread over\r\nAfrica, from the Cape of Good Hope to the deserts of Arabia; two species\r\nof the Rhea range over the plains of the Pampas and Patagonia, in South\r\nAmerica; the continent of Australia is the abode of the Emu; the\r\nCassowary roves over some of the large islands of the Indian\r\nArchipelago; and the Apteryx dwells in New Zealand. The Dodo, a very\r\nlarge bird of the struthious kind, extirpated by the Dutch navigators,\r\nonce inhabited Mauritius and the adjacent island of Don Rodriguez.\r\n\r\nThe remains of a very numerous group of extinct struthious birds have\r\nbeen recently discovered imbedded in the very recent geological deposits\r\nof New Zealand. One of its genera, the Dinornis, has several species,\r\nthe largest of which, the D. giganteus, attains a height of 11 feet, or\r\ndouble that of the largest ostrich; another, the Palapteryx, upwards of\r\n9 feet. From the position in which these bones are found, as well as\r\nfrom their state of preservation, they can scarcely be considered as\r\nfossil, although belonging to species which have become extinct.\r\nProfessor Owen has described no less than six species of dinornis, and\r\nfour of palapteryx; and later discoveries in the colony will probably\r\nadd several to these numbers. No better example can be cited as\r\nelucidating the certitude of the deductions of the comparative anatomist\r\nthan what led to the first discovery of this extraordinary group of\r\nbirds. A small portion of a bone, which from its dimensions appeared to\r\nhave belonged rather to a quadruped of the size of an ox than to a bird,\r\nwas submitted to Mr. Owen; he boldly pronounced it, from its structure,\r\nto belong to a bird of the ostrich kind—a decision that was soon\r\nabundantly confirmed by the subsequent discovery not only of the bones\r\nof the bird, but of its eggs.\r\n\r\nThe bones of another extinct bird, the Nestor, have been found, mixed\r\nwith those of the Dinornis. It had been something between an owl and a\r\nparrot, but more nearly allied to the latter. There are two species\r\nliving of the nestor, one in New Zealand, another in Philip Island, only\r\nfive miles in extent, and it is found in no other part of the world. The\r\nNotornis, an extinct race, closely allied to the water-hen, of the size\r\nof a bustard, had also been an ancient inhabitant of these islands,\r\nwhere birds did and do exist, almost to the entire exclusion of\r\nquadrupeds and reptiles: an extinct species of dog, and a rat still\r\nexisting, are the only land animals which shared in these extensive\r\nterritories with multitudes of the feathered race.[182]\r\n\r\nThe ostrich family live on vegetables; the form of those that had their\r\nhome in New Zealand would lead to the conclusion that they had fed on\r\nthe edible roots of the fern which covers that country; and as no\r\nquadruped excepting a rat is indigenous in New Zealand, though 700 miles\r\nlong, and in many places 90 wide, these birds could have had no enemy\r\nbut man, the most formidable of all.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful and sprightly Tui, or parson-bird, native in New Zealand,\r\nis jet black with a white tuft on its breast, and so imitative that it\r\ncan be taught to repeat whole sentences. There are parrots and\r\nparoquets, vast numbers of pigeons, fine warblers, many small birds, and\r\na great variety of water-fowl, amongst others a cormorant, which, though\r\nweb-footed, perches on the trees that overhang the streams and sea,\r\nwatching for fish; and a snow-white frigate-bird, that pounces on them\r\nfrom a great height in the air. Altogether, there are at least 84\r\nspecies of birds that inhabit these islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n             Distribution of Mammalia throughout the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONIC acid, water, and ammonia, contain the elements necessary for\r\nthe support of animals, as well as of vegetables. They are supplied to\r\nthe graminivora in the vegetable food, which is converted into animal\r\nsubstance by their vital functions.\r\n\r\nVitality in animals, as in vegetables, is the power they have of\r\nassimilating their food, a process independent of volition, since it is\r\ncarried on during sleep, and is the cause of force. Animals inhale\r\noxygen with the air they breathe; part of the oxygen combines with the\r\ncarbon contained in the food, and is exhaled in the form of carbonic\r\nacid gas. With every effort, with every breath, and with every motion,\r\nvoluntary or involuntary, at every instant of life, a part of the\r\nmuscular substance becomes dead, separates from the living part,\r\ncombines with the remaining portion of inhaled oxygen, and is removed.\r\nFood, therefore, is necessary to compensate for the waste, to supply\r\nnourishment, and to restore strength to the nerves, on which all vital\r\nmotion depends; for by the nerves volition acts on living matter. Food\r\nwould not be sufficient to make up for this waste, and consequent loss\r\nof strength, without sleep; during which voluntary motion ceases, and\r\nthe undisturbed assimilation of the food suffices to restore strength,\r\nand to make up for the involuntary motion of breathing, which is also a\r\nsource of waste.\r\n\r\nThe perpetual combination of the oxygen of the atmosphere with the\r\ncarbon of the food, and with the effete substance of the body, is a real\r\ncombustion, and is supposed to be the cause of animal heat, because heat\r\nis constantly given out by the combination of carbon and oxygen; and,\r\nwithout a constant supply of food, the oxygen would soon consume the\r\nwhole animal, except the bones.\r\n\r\nGraminivorous animals inhale oxygen in breathing, and, as vegetable food\r\ndoes not contain so much carbon as animal food, they require a greater\r\nsupply to compensate for the wasting influence of the oxygen; therefore,\r\ncattle are constantly eating. But the nutritious parts of vegetables are\r\nidentical in composition with the chief constituents of the blood; and\r\nfrom blood every part of the animal body, and even a portion of the\r\nbones, is formed.\r\n\r\nCarnivorous animals have not pores in the skin, therefore their supply\r\nof oxygen is from their breath only; and, as animal food contains a\r\ngreater quantity of carbon, they do not require to eat so often as\r\nanimals that feed on vegetables. The restlessness of carnivorous animals\r\nwhen confined in a cage is owing to the superabundance of carbon in\r\ntheir food. They move about continually to quicken respiration, and by\r\nthat means procure a supply of oxygen to carry off the redundant carbon.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of animal heat is in proportion to the amount of the oxygen\r\ninspired in equal times. The heat of birds is greater than that of\r\nquadrupeds, and in both it is higher than the temperature of amphibious\r\nanimals and fishes, which have the coldest blood. On these subjects we\r\nare indebted to Professor Liebig, who has thrown so much light on the\r\nimportant sciences of animal and vegetable chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe mammalia consist of nine orders of animals, which differ in\r\nappearance and in their nature; but they agree in the one attribute of\r\nsuckling their young. These orders are—the Quadrumana, animals which can\r\nuse their fore feet as hands, as monkeys and Apes; Cheiroptera, animals\r\nwith winged arms, as bats; Carnivora, that live on animal food, as the\r\nlion, tiger, bear, &c.; Rodentia, or gnawers, as beavers, squirrels,\r\nmice; Edentata or toothless animals [or more properly wanting certain\r\nteeth, as the canines or incisors], as anteaters and armadilloes;\r\nPachydermata, or thick-skinned animals, as the elephant, the horse;\r\nRuminantia, animals that chew the cud, as camels, lamas, giraffes, cows,\r\nsheep, deer; Marsupialia, possessing a pouch in which the young is\r\nreceived after birth; and Cetaceæ, as whales and dolphins.\r\n\r\nThe animal creation, like the vegetable, varies correspondingly with\r\nheight and latitude; the changes of species in ascending the Himalaya,\r\nfor instance, are similar to what a traveller would meet with in his\r\njourney from a southern to a high northern latitude. The number of land\r\nanimals increases from the frigid zones to the equator, but the law is\r\nreversed with regard to the marine mammalia, which abound most in high\r\nlatitudes. Taking a broad view of the distribution of the nine orders of\r\nmammalia, it may be observed that the tropical forests are the chief\r\nabode of the monkey tribe: Asia is the home of the ape, especially the\r\nislands of the Indian Archipelago, as far as the most easterly meridian\r\nof Timor, beyond which there are none.\r\n\r\nThey abound throughout Africa from the Cape of Good Hope to Gibraltar,\r\nwhere the Barbary ape or magot is found: another species of magot\r\ninhabits the island of Niphon, the northern limit of monkeys at the\r\neastern extremity of the continent.\r\n\r\nThe bats that live on fruits are chiefly met with in tropical and warm\r\nclimates, especially in the Indian Archipelago; the common bats, which\r\nlive on insects, and are so numerous in species as to form more than a\r\nthird of the whole family, are found everywhere except in arctic\r\nAmerica. The Vampire is only met with in tropical America. Carnivorous\r\nmammalia are distributed all over the globe, though very unequally: in\r\nAustralia there are only four species, two of which are bats; there are\r\nonly 13 in South America, and 27 in the Oceanic region; while in the\r\ntropical regions of America there are 109, in Africa 130, and in Asia\r\n166 species of carnivora; and so rapid is their increase towards the\r\ntropical regions, that there are nearly three times as many in the\r\ntropical as in the temperate zones.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Gnawers or Rodents, species of the same group\r\nfrequently have a wide range in the same, or nearly the same, parallels\r\nof latitude, but when they are inhabitants of high mountain-ridges they\r\nfollow the direction of the chain, whatever that may be, and groups\r\nconfined to high latitudes often appear again at great elevations in low\r\nlatitudes. The Edentata are particularly characteristic of South\r\nAmerica, where there are three times as many species as there are in\r\nAsia, Africa, and Australia, taken together. In the three latter\r\ncountries they only occur at intervals, but in America they extend from\r\nthe tropic of Cancer to the plains of Patagonia. Thick-skinned and\r\nruminating animals are very abundant in the old continent, especially in\r\nAsia and Africa; they are also in North America, but in the southern\r\npart of that continent there is only the Tapir, and in Australia there\r\nare none. The marsupialia are confined to Australia and America.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of animals is guided by laws analogous to those which\r\nregulate the distribution of plants, insects, fishes, and birds. Each\r\ncontinent, and even different parts of the same continent, are centres\r\nof zoological families, which have always existed there, and nowhere\r\nelse; each group being almost always specifically different from all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nFood, security, and temperature have no influence, as primary causes, in\r\nthe distribution of animals. The plains of America are not less fit for\r\nrearing oxen than the meadows of Europe; yet the common ox was not found\r\nin that continent at the time of its discovery; and with regard to\r\ntemperature, this animal thrives on the llanos of Venezuela and the\r\npampas of Brazil as well as on the steppes in Europe. The horse is\r\nanother example: originally a native of the deserts of Tartary, he now\r\nroams wild in herds of hundreds of thousands on the grassy plains of\r\nAmerica, though unknown in that continent at the time of the Spanish\r\ninvasion. All animals, however, are not so flexible in their\r\nconstitutions, for most of them would perish from change of climate. The\r\nstations which the different families now occupy must have been allotted\r\nto them as each part of the land rose above the ocean; and because they\r\nhave found in these stations all that was necessary for their existence,\r\nmany have never wandered from them, notwithstanding their powers of\r\nlocomotion; while others have migrated, but only within certain bounds.\r\n\r\nInstinct leads animals to migrate when they become too numerous; the rat\r\nin Kamtchatka, according to Pennant, sets out in spring in great\r\nmultitudes, and travels 800 miles, swimming over rivers and lakes; and\r\nthe Lapland marmot or lemming, native in the mountains of Kolen,\r\nmigrates in bands, once or twice in 25 years, to the Western Ocean,\r\nwhich they enter and are drowned; other bands go through Swedish Lapland\r\nand perish in the Gulf of Bothnia. Thus, nature provides a remedy\r\nagainst the over increase of any one species, and maintains the balance\r\nof the whole. A temporary migration for food is not uncommon in animals.\r\nThe wild ass, a native of the deserts of Great Tartary, in summer feeds\r\nto the east and north of the lake of Aral, and in autumn they migrate in\r\nthousands to the north of India, and even to Persia.[183] The ruminating\r\nanimals that dwell in the inaccessible parts of the Himalaya descend to\r\ntheir lower declivities in search of food in winter; and for the same\r\nreason the reindeer and musk-ox leave the Arctic snows.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic regions form a district common to Europe, Asia, and America.\r\nOn this account, the animals inhabiting the northern parts of these\r\ncontinents are sometimes identical, often very similar; in fact, there\r\nis no genus of quadrupeds in the Arctic regions that is not found in the\r\nthree continents, though there are only 27 species common to all, and\r\nthese are mostly fur-bearing animals. In the temperate zone of Europe\r\nand Asia, which forms an uninterrupted region, identity of species is\r\noccasionally met with, but, for the most part, marked by such varieties\r\nin size and colour as might be expected to arise from difference of food\r\nand climate. The same genera are sometimes found in the intertropical\r\nparts of Asia, Africa, and America, but the same species never; much\r\nless in the south temperate zones of these continents, where all the\r\nanimals are different, whether birds, beasts, insects, or reptiles; but\r\nin similar climates analogous tribes replace one another.\r\n\r\nEurope has no family and no order peculiarly its own, and many of its\r\nspecies are common to other countries; consequently the great zoological\r\ndistricts, where the subject is viewed on a broad scale, are Asia,\r\nAfrica, Oceanica, America, and Australia; but in each of these there are\r\nsmaller districts, to which particular genera and families are confined.\r\nYet when the regions are not separated by lofty mountain-chains, acting\r\nas barriers, the races are in most cases blended together on the\r\nconfines between the two districts, so that there is not a sudden\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          EUROPEAN QUADRUPEDS.\r\n\r\nThe character of the animals of temperate Europe has been more changed\r\nby the progress of civilization than that of any other quarter of the\r\nglobe. Many of its original inhabitants have been extirpated, and new\r\nraces introduced; but it seems always to have had various animals\r\ncapable of being domesticated. The wild cattle in the parks of the Duke\r\nof Hamilton and the Earl of Tankerville are the only remnants of the\r\nancient inhabitants of the British forests, though they were spread over\r\nEurope, and perhaps were the parent stock from which the European cattle\r\nof the present time have descended; though the Aurochs, a race nearly\r\nextinct, and found only in the forests of Lithuania and the Caucasus,\r\nmay have some claim to the pedigree. Both races are supposed to have\r\ncome from Asia. The Mouflon, which exists in Corsica and Sardinia, is\r\nsaid to be the parent stock of our domestic sheep. The pig, the goat,\r\nthe fallow-deer, and red-deer, have been reclaimed, and also the\r\nreindeer, which cannot strictly be called European, since it also\r\ninhabits the northern regions of Asia and America. The cat is European;\r\nand, altogether, eight or ten species of tamed quadrupeds have sprung\r\nfrom native animals.\r\n\r\nThere are still about 180 wild land-animals in Europe: 45 of these are\r\nalso found in western Asia, and nine in northern Africa. The most\r\nremarkable are the reindeer, elk, red and fallow deer, the roe-buck,\r\nglutton, lynx, polecat, several wild-cats, the common and black\r\nsquirrels, the fox, wild boar, wolf, the black and the brown bear, eight\r\nspecies of weasels, and seven of mice. The otter is common; but the\r\nbeaver is now found only on the Rhine, the Rhone, the Danube, and some\r\nother large rivers; rabbits and hares are numerous; the hedgehog is\r\neverywhere; the porcupine in southern Europe only; the chamois and ibex\r\nin the Alps and Pyrenees. Many species of these animals are widely\r\ndistributed over Europe, generally with variations in size and colour.\r\nThe chamois of the Alps and Pyrenees, though the same in species, is\r\nslightly varied in appearance; and the fox of the most northern parts of\r\nEurope is larger than that in Italy, with a richer fur, and somewhat\r\ndifferent colour.\r\n\r\nSome animals never descend below a certain height, as the ibex and\r\nchamois, which live on higher ground than any of their order, being\r\nusually found between the region of trees and the line of perpetual\r\nsnow, which is about 8900 feet on the southern, and 8200 on the northern\r\ndeclivities of the Alps. The common stag does not go above 7000 feet,\r\nand the fallow-deer not more than 6000, above the level of the sea:\r\nthese two, however, descend to the plains, the former never do. The\r\nbear, lynx, and the stoat ascend nearly to the limit of perpetual snow.\r\n\r\nSome European animals are much circumscribed in their locality. The\r\nichneumon is peculiar to Egypt; the mouflon is confined to Corsica and\r\nSardinia; there are a weasel and bat which inhabit Sardinia only; and\r\nSicily has several peculiar species of bats and mice. There is only one\r\nspecies of monkey in Europe, which lives on the rock of Gibraltar, and\r\nis supposed to have been brought from Africa. All the indigenous British\r\nquadrupeds now existing, together with the hyæna, tiger, bear, and wolf,\r\nwhose bones have been found in caverns, are also found in the same state\r\nin Germany. Ireland was separated by the Irish Channel before all the\r\nanimals had migrated across England; so that our squirrel, mole,\r\npolecat, dormouse, and many smaller quadrupeds, never reached the sister\r\nisland. Mr. Owen has shown that the British horse, ass, hog, the smaller\r\nwild ox, the goat, roe, beaver, and many small rodents, are the same\r\nspecies with those which had co-existed with the mammoth, the great\r\nnorthern hippopotamus, and two kinds of rhinoceros long extinct. So that\r\na part only of the modern tertiary fauna has perished, from whence he\r\ninfers that the cause of their destruction was not a violent universal\r\ncatastrophe from which none could escape. The Bos longifrons was\r\nco-existent with man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ASIATIC QUADRUPEDS.\r\n\r\nAsia has a greater number and a greater variety of wild animals than any\r\ncountry, except America, and also a larger proportion of those that are\r\ndomesticated. Though civilized from the earliest ages, the destruction\r\nof the animal creation has not been so great as in Europe, owing to the\r\ninaccessible height of the mountains, the extent of the plains and\r\ndesert, and, not least, to the impenetrable forests and jungles, which\r\nafford them a safe retreat: 288 mammalia are Asiatic, of which 188 are\r\ncommon to it and other countries; these, however, chiefly belong to the\r\ntemperate zone.\r\n\r\nAsia Minor is a district of transition from the fauna of Europe to that\r\nof Asia. There the chamois, the bouquetin, the brown bear, the wolf,\r\nfox, hare, and others, are mingled with the hyæna, the Angora goat,\r\nwhich bears a valuable fleece, the Argali or wild sheep, the white\r\nsquirrel; and even the Bengal royal tiger is sometimes seen on Mount\r\nArarat, and is not uncommon in Azerbijan and the mountains in Persia.\r\n\r\nArabia is inhabited by the hyæna, panther, jackal, wolf, and musk-deer.\r\nAntelopes and monkeys are found in Yemen and Aden. Most of these are\r\nalso indigenous in Persia. The wild ass, Onagra, a handsome spirited\r\nanimal of great speed, and so shy that it is scarcely possible to come\r\nnear it, wanders in herds over the plains and table-lands of central\r\nAsia. It is also found in the Indian desert, and especially in the Run\r\nof Cutch—“the wilderness and the barren lands are his dwelling”—and in\r\nthe most elevated regions of Tartary and Tibet, on the shores of the\r\nsacred lakes of Manasarowar and Rakastal, at a height of more than\r\n15,250 feet above the sea.[184]\r\n\r\nThe table-lands and mountains which divide eastern Asia almost into\r\npolar and tropical zones, produce as great a distinction in the\r\ncharacter of its indigenous fauna. The severity of the climate in\r\nSiberia renders the skins of its numerous fur-bearing animals more\r\nvaluable. These are reindeer, elks, wolves, the large white bear, that\r\nlives among the ice on the Arctic shores, several other bears, the lynx,\r\nvarious kinds of martens and cats, the common, the blue, and the black\r\nfox, the ermine, and sable. The fur of these last is much esteemed, and\r\nis only equalled by that of the sea-otter, which inhabits the shores on\r\nboth sides of the northern Pacific.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Jerboa, which burrows in sandy deserts, on the\r\ntable-land and elsewhere, all the Asiatic species of gnawers are\r\nconfined to Siberia. The most remarkable of these is the flying\r\nsquirrel. The Altaï Mountains teem with wild animals, besides many of\r\nthose mentioned. There are large stags, bears, some peculiar weasels,\r\nthe argali, and the wild sheep. The wild goat of the Alps is found in\r\nthe Sayansk part of the chain; the glutton and musk-deer in the Baikal;\r\nand in Da-Ouria the red-deer and the Antelope Saiga. The Bengal tiger\r\nand the Felis Irbis, a species of panther, wander from the Celestial\r\nMountains to the Altaï chain and southern Siberia: the Tiger is met with\r\neven on the banks of the Obi, and also in China, though in the northern\r\nregions it differs considerably from the same species in Bengal; thus it\r\ncan bear a mean annual temperature of from 81° of Fahrenheit to the\r\nfreezing point. The Tapir, and many of the animals of the Indian\r\nArchipelago, are found in the southern provinces of the Chinese empire;\r\nbut its fauna is little known. It is, however, probable that in the\r\nnorthern parts it resembles that of the Altaï mountains and Siberia. The\r\nanimals of Japan have a strong analogy to those of Europe: many are\r\nidentical, or slightly varied, as the badger, otter, mole, common fox,\r\nmarten, and squirrel. On the other hand, a large species of bear in the\r\nisland of Jezo resembles the grizzly bear in the Rocky Mountains of\r\nNorth America. A chamois in other parts of Japan is similar to the\r\nAntelope montana of the same mountains: and other animals native in\r\nJapan are the same with those in Sumatra; so that its fauna is connected\r\nwith that of very distant regions.\r\n\r\nA few animals are peculiar to the high cold plains of the table-land of\r\neastern Asia: the dziggetai, a very fleet animal, resembling both the\r\nhorse and the ass, is peculiar to these Tartarian steppes; it is\r\nprobably the same species as the Kiang of Tibet, which inhabits at very\r\ngreat heights, and has been seen on the banks of the sacred lake of\r\nManasarowar, at an elevation of 15,250 feet, by Lieutenant Strachey: two\r\nspecies of antelopes inhabit the plains of Tibet, congregating in\r\nimmense herds, with sentinels so vigilant that it is scarcely possible\r\nto approach them.\r\n\r\nThe Dzeran, or yellow goat, which is both swift and shy, and the\r\nhandsome Tartar ox, are native in these wilds; also the shawl-wool goat\r\nand the manul, from which the Angora cat, so much admired in Persia and\r\nEurope, is descended. Most of the animals that live at such heights\r\ncannot exist in less elevated and warmer regions, exhibiting a striking\r\ninstance of the limited distribution of species. Goats and sheep best\r\nendure the thin air and great cold of high lands: the Cashmere goat and\r\nArgoli sheep browse on the plains of Tibet at elevations of from 10,000\r\nto 13,000 feet; the rass, a sheep with straight spiral horns, lives on\r\nthe table-lands of Pamer, which are 15,000 feet above the sea; and also\r\nthe kutch-gar, a species of sheep which is about the height of a\r\nyear-old colt, with fine-curling horns: they congregate in flocks of\r\nmany hundreds, and are hunted by the Kirghis.\r\n\r\nThe ruminating animals of Asia are more numerous and excellent than\r\nthose of any other part of the world; 64 species are native, and 46 of\r\nthese exist there only. There are several species of wild oxen; one in\r\nthe Birmese empire, and on the mountains of north-eastern India, with\r\nspiral twisted horns. The buffalo is native in China, India, Borneo, and\r\nthe Sunda Islands; it is a large animal, formidable in a wild state, but\r\ndomesticated universally in the East. It was introduced into Italy in\r\nthe sixth century, and large herds now graze in the low marshy plains\r\nnear the sea.\r\n\r\nVarious kinds of oxen have been domesticated in India time immemorial:\r\nthe handsome Indian ox, with a hump on the shoulder, has been venerated\r\nby the Brahmins for ages; the beautiful white silky tail of the\r\ndomesticated ox of Tartary, used in the East to drive away flies, was\r\nadopted as the Turkish standard; and the common Indian ox differs from\r\nall others in the great speed of its course. Some other species of\r\ncattle have been tamed, and some are still wild in India, Java, and\r\nother Asiatic islands. The Cashmere goat, which bears the shawl-wool, is\r\nthe most valuable of the endless varieties of goats and sheep of Asia;\r\nit is kept in large herds in the great valleys on the northern and\r\nsouthern declivities of the Himalaya, and in the upper regions of\r\nBhotan, where the cold climate is congenial to it.\r\n\r\nThe Bactrian camel, with two humps, is strong, rough, and hairy, and is\r\nsaid to occur in a wild state in the desert of Shamo: it is the camel of\r\ncentral Asia, north of the Himalaya and Taurus, also of the Crimea and\r\nthe countries round the Caucasus. The common or Arabian camel with one\r\nhump is a native of Asia, though only known now in a domesticated state;\r\nit has been introduced into Africa, Italy, the Canary islands, and even\r\ninto the elevated regions of the Peru-Bolivian Andes. The best come from\r\nthe province of Nejed in Arabia, which, on that account, is called the\r\n“mother of camels.” The camel of Oman is remarkable for beauty and\r\nswiftness.\r\n\r\nTen species of antelopes and twenty of deer are peculiar to Asia: two\r\nspecies of antelopes have already been mentioned as peculiar to the\r\ntable-lands, the others are distributed in the Asiatic archipelago. The\r\ngenuine musk-deer (Moschus moschiferus) inhabits the mountainous\r\ncountries of central and south-eastern Asia, between China and Tartary,\r\nthe regions round Lake Baikal, the Altaï mountains, Nepaul, Bhotan,\r\nTibet, and the adjacent countries of China and Tonquin.\r\n\r\nAsia possesses about ten native species of Pachydermata, including the\r\nelephant, horse, ass, which have been domesticated from the time of the\r\nearliest scriptural records. The horse is supposed to have existed wild\r\nin the plains of central Asia, as the dromedary in Arabia; though now\r\nthey are only known as domestic animals. The Arabian and Persian horses\r\nhave acknowledged excellence and beauty, and from these our best\r\nEuropean horses are descended; the African horse, which was introduced\r\ninto Spain by the Moors, is probably of the same race.\r\n\r\nThe elephant has long been a domestic animal in Asia, though it still\r\nroams wild in formidable herds through the forests and jungles at the\r\nfoot of the Himalaya, in other parts of India, the Indo-Chinese\r\npeninsula, and the islands of Sumatra and Ceylon; the hunting elephant\r\nis esteemed the most noble. A one-horned rhinoceros is a native of\r\ncontinental Asia.\r\n\r\nThere are 60 genera of Asiatic carnivorous animals, of which the royal\r\ntiger is the handsomest and the most formidable: its favourite\r\nhabitation is in the jungles of Hindostan, though it wanders nearly to\r\nthe limit of perpetual snow in the Himalaya, to the Persian and Armenian\r\nmountains, to Siberia and China. Leopards and panthers are common, and\r\nthere is a maneless lion in Guzerat: the Chitta, used in hunting, is the\r\nonly one of the panthers capable of being tamed. The hyæna is found\r\neverywhere, excepting the Birman empire, in which there are neither\r\nwolves, hyænas, foxes, nor jackals. There are four species of bears in\r\nIndia; that of Nepaul has valuable fur: the wild boar, hog, and dogs of\r\nendless variety, abound.\r\n\r\nThe Edentata have only two representatives in India, both manis or\r\npangolins; which differ from all others except the African, in being\r\ncovered with imbricated scales. Of these the short-tailed pangolin, or\r\nscaly anteater, is found throughout the Deccan, Bengal, Nepaul, the\r\nsouthern provinces of China, and Formosa.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Archipelago and the Indo-Chinese peninsula form a zoological\r\nprovince of a very peculiar nature, being allied to the faunas of India,\r\nAustralia, and South America, yet having animals exclusively its own.\r\nThe royal tiger is in great abundance in the Malay peninsula, and also\r\nthe black variety of the panther, leopard, wild cats, multitudes of\r\nelephants, the rhinoceros of all three species, the Malayan tapir, many\r\ndeer, the Babiroussa hog, and another species of that genus. Some groups\r\nof the islands have several animals in common, either identical or with\r\nslight variations, that are altogether wanting in other islands, which,\r\nin their turn, have creatures of their own. Many species are common to\r\nthe archipelago and the neighbouring parts of the continent, or even to\r\nChina, Bengal, Hindostan, and Ceylon. Flying quadrupeds are a\r\ndistinguishing feature of this archipelago, though some do not\r\nabsolutely fly, but, by an extension of the skin of their sides to their\r\nlegs, which serves as a parachute, they take long leaps. Nocturnal\r\nflying squirrels, of several species, are common to the Malayan\r\npeninsula and the Sunda Islands, especially Java; and three species of\r\nflying Lemurs inhabit Sunda, Malacca, and the Pelew Islands. Besides\r\nthese, there are the frugivorous bats, which really fly, differing from\r\nbats in other countries by living exclusively upon vegetable food. The\r\nedible roussette, or kalong, one of the largest known, appears in flocks\r\nof hundreds, and even thousands, in Java, Sumatra, and Banda: the\r\nPteropus funereus, another of these large bats, assembles in as great\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nA hundred and eighty species of the ape and monkey tribe are entirely\r\nAsiatic: monkeys are found only on the coast of India, Cochin-China, and\r\nthe Sunda Islands; the long-armed apes or gibbons are in the Sunda\r\nIslands and the Malayan peninsula. The Simayang, a very large ape of\r\nSumatra and Bencoolen, goes in large troops, following a leader, and\r\nmakes a howling noise at sunrise and sunset that is heard miles off.\r\nSumatra and Borneo are the peculiar abode of the Orang-outang, which, in\r\nthe Malay language, means the “man of woods,” which, except perhaps the\r\nChimpanzee of Africa, approaches nearest to man. It has never spread\r\nover the islands it inhabits, though there seems to be nothing to\r\nprevent it, but it finds all that is necessary within a limited\r\ndistrict. The orang-outang and the long-armed apes have extraordinary\r\nmuscular strength, and swing from tree to tree by their arms.\r\n\r\nThe Malays have given the name of orang, or man, to the whole tribe, on\r\naccount of their intelligence as well as their form.\r\n\r\nA two-horned rhinoceros is peculiar to Java, of a different species from\r\nthe African, also the Felis macrocelis, and a very large bear; there are\r\nonly two species of squirrels in Java, which is remarkable, as the Sunda\r\nIslands are rich in them. The royal tiger of India and the elephant are\r\nfound only in Sumatra, and the babiroussa lives in Borneo; but these two\r\nislands have many quadrupeds in common, as a leopard, the one-horned\r\nrhinoceros, the black antelope, some graceful miniature creatures of the\r\ndeer kind, the Tapir, also found in Malacca, besides a wild boar, an\r\ninhabitant of all the marshy forest from Borneo to New Guinea. In the\r\nlarger islands deer abound, some as large as the elk, probably the\r\nHippelaphus of Aristotle.\r\n\r\nThe Anoa, a ruminating animal about the size of a sheep, a species of\r\nantelope, shy and savage, goes in herds in the mountains of Celebes,\r\nwhere many forms of animals strangers to the Sunda Islands begin to\r\nappear, as some sorts of phalangers, or pouched quadrupeds. These new\r\nforms become more numerous in the Moluccas, which are inhabited by\r\nflying phalangers and other pouched animals, with scaly tails. The\r\nphalangers are nocturnal, and live on trees. In New Guinea there are\r\nkangaroos, the spotted phalanger, the pelandoe, the New Guinea hog, and\r\nthe Papua dog, said to be the origin of all the native dogs in Australia\r\nand Oceanica, wild or tame.\r\n\r\nThe fauna of the Philippine Islands is analogous to that in the Sunda\r\nIslands. They have several quadrupeds in common with India and Ceylon,\r\nbut there are others which probably are not found in these localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          AFRICAN QUADRUPEDS.\r\n\r\nThe opposite extremes of aridity and moisture in the African continent\r\nhave had great influence in the nature and distribution of its animals;\r\nand since by far the greater part consists of plains utterly barren or\r\ncovered by temporary verdure, and watered by inconstant streams that\r\nflow only a few months in the year, fleet animals, fitted to live on\r\narid plains, are far more abundant than those that require rich\r\nvegetation and much water. The latter are chiefly confined to the\r\nintertropical coasts, and especially to the large jungles and deep\r\nforests at the northern declivity of the table-land, where several\r\ngenera and many species exist that are not found elsewhere. Africa has a\r\nfauna in many respects insulated from that of every other part of the\r\nglobe; for although about 100 of its quadrupeds are common to other\r\ncountries, there are 250 species its own. Several of these animals,\r\nespecially the larger kinds, are distributed over the whole table-land\r\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope to the highlands of Abyssinia and Senegambia\r\nwithout the smallest variety, and many are slightly modified in colour\r\nand size. Ruminating animals are very numerous, though few have been\r\ndomesticated: of these, the ox of Abyssinia and Bornou is remarkable\r\nfrom the extraordinary size of its horns, which are sometimes 2 feet in\r\ncircumference at the root; and the Galla ox of Abyssinia has horns 4\r\nfeet long. There are many African varieties of buffalo; that at the Cape\r\nof Good Hope is a large, fierce animal, wandering in herds in every part\r\nof the country, even to Abyssinia: the flesh of the whole race is\r\ntainted with the odour of musk. The African sheep and goats, of which\r\nthere are many varieties, differ from those of other countries; the wool\r\nof all is coarse, except that of the Merino sheep, said to have been\r\nintroduced into Spain by the Moors from Morocco.\r\n\r\nNo country has produced a ruminating animal similar, or even analogous,\r\nto the Giraffe, or Camelopard, which ranges widely over south Africa\r\nfrom the northern banks of the Gareep, or Orange river, to the Great\r\nDesert; it is also found in Dongola and in Abyssinia. It is a gentle,\r\ntimid animal, which has been seen in troops of 100. The earliest record\r\nwe have of it is in the sculptured monuments of the ancient Egyptians,\r\nand it is well known that it was brought to Rome to grace the triumph of\r\na victorious emperor.\r\n\r\nAfrica may truly be said to be the land of the genus Antelope, which is\r\nfound in every part of it, where it represents the deer of Europe, Asia,\r\nand America. Different species have their peculiar localities, while\r\nothers are widely dispersed, sometimes with and sometimes without any\r\nsensible variety of size or colour. The greater number are inhabitants\r\nof the plains, while a few penetrate into the forests. Sixty species\r\nhave been described, of which at least 26 are found north of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope and in the adjacent countries. They are of every size, from\r\nthe pigmy antelope not larger than a hare, to the Caama, which is as\r\nlarge as an ox. Timidity is the universal character of the race. Most\r\nspecies are gregarious; and the number in a herd is far too great even\r\nto guess at. Like all animals that feed in groups, they have sentinels;\r\nand they are the easy prey of so many carnivorous animals, that their\r\nsafety requires the precaution. At the head of their enemies is the\r\nlion, who lurks among the tall reeds at the fountain to seize them when\r\nthey come to drink. They are graceful in their motions, especially the\r\nspring-buck, which goes in a compact troop; and in their march there is\r\nconstantly one which gathers its slender limbs together and bounds into\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nAfrica has only two species of deer, both belonging to the Atlas: one is\r\nthe common fallow-deer of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe 38 species of rodentia, or gnawing quadrupeds, of this continent,\r\nlive on the plains; and many of them are leaping animals, as the Jerboa\r\ncapensis. Squirrels are comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nThere are some species of the horse peculiar to south Africa; of these\r\nthe gaily-striped Zebra and the more sober-coloured Quagga wander in\r\ntroops over the plains, often in company with ostriches. An alliance\r\nbetween creatures differing in nature and habits is not easily accounted\r\nfor. The two-horned rhinoceros of Africa is different from that of Asia:\r\nthere are certainly three, and probably five, species of these huge\r\nanimals peculiar to the table-land. Dr. Smith saw 150 in one day near\r\nthe 24th parallel of south latitude. The hippopotamus is exclusively\r\nAfrican: multitudes inhabit the lakes and rivers in the intertropical\r\nand southern parts of the continent; those that inhabit the Nile and\r\nSenegal appear to form different species. An elephant, differing in\r\nspecies from that of Asia, is so numerous, that 200 have been seen in a\r\nherd near Lake Tchad. They are not domesticated in Africa, and are\r\nhunted by the natives for their tusks. The Phacochœre, or Ethiopian hog,\r\nand a species of Hyrax, are among the Pachydermata of this country. The\r\nmonkey tribe is found in all the hot parts of Africa: peculiar genera\r\nare allotted to particular districts. Except a few in Asia, the family\r\nof guenons is found in no part of the world but the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nthe coasts of Loango and Guinea, where they swarm.\r\n\r\nThe species are numerous, and vary much in size and colours: the\r\ncynocephalus, or blue-headed baboon, with a face like that of a dog, is\r\nlarge, ferocious, and dangerous. One species of these baboons inhabits\r\nGuinea, others the southern parts of the table-land, and one is met with\r\neverywhere from Sennaar to Cafraria. A remarkable long-eared kind is\r\nfound in Abyssinia; the mandrills, which belong to the same genus, are\r\nconfined to central Africa. The magot or Barbary ape is in north Africa;\r\nand the only macac in this continent inhabits the mountains in the high\r\ncountry of southern Abyssinia, 8000 feet above the level of the sea. The\r\nAfrican species of thumbless apes are met with in the tropical countries\r\non the west coast, where the Colobus comosus, or king of the monkeys,\r\nalso lives, so called by the natives from its beautiful fur and singular\r\nhead of hair; another of these is peculiar to the low lands of Gojam,\r\nKulla, and Damot. The Chimpanzee, which so nearly approaches the human\r\nform, inhabits the forests of south Africa from Cape Negro to the\r\nGambia. Living in society like all apes and monkeys, which are eminently\r\nsociable, it is very intelligent and easily tamed. A new species of\r\nAfrican Chimpanzee, equalling in size the Orang-outang, has been\r\nrecently described by Professor Owen: it is probably the largest of the\r\nquadrumana, and by all accounts the most dangerous and ferocious.\r\n\r\nBaron Humboldt observes that all apes resembling man have an expression\r\nof sadness; that their gaiety diminishes as their intelligence\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\nAfrica possesses the cat tribe in great variety and beauty; lions,\r\nleopards, and panthers are numerous throughout the continent; servals\r\nand viverrine cats are in the torrid districts; and the lion of the\r\nAtlas is said to be the most formidable of all. In no country are foxes\r\nso abundant. Various species inhabit Nubia, Abyssinia, and the Cape of\r\nGood Hope. The corsac is peculiar to the Cape. The long-eared fox, the\r\nfamel of Kordofan, and some others, are found in Africa only. There are\r\nalso various species of dogs, the hyæna, and the jackal. The hyænas hunt\r\nin packs, attack the lion and panther, and easily destroy them.\r\n\r\nTwo species of Edentata are African—the long-tailed manis, and the\r\nAard-vark, or earth-hog: the first is covered with scales, the latter\r\nwith coarse long hair; they burrow in the ground and feed on ants. Great\r\nflocks of a large migratory vampire-bat frequent the Slave-coast.\r\nAltogether there are 26 species of African bats.\r\n\r\nMultitudes of antelopes of various species, lions, leopards, panthers,\r\nhyænas, jackals, and some other carnivora, live in the oases of the\r\ngreat northern deserts; jerboas, and endless species of leaping gnawers,\r\nrats, and mice burrow in the ground. The dryness of the climate and soil\r\nkeeps the coats of the animals clean and glossy; and it has been\r\nobserved that tawny and grey tints are the prevailing colours in the\r\nfauna of the north African deserts, not only in the birds and beasts,\r\nbut in reptiles and insects. In consequence of the continuous desert\r\nextending from North Africa through Arabia to Persia and India, many\r\nanalogous species of animals exist in those countries: in some instances\r\nthey are the same, or varieties of the same, species, as the ass, the\r\ndziggeti, antelopes, leopards, panthers, jackals, and hyænas.\r\n\r\nThe fauna on the eastern side of the great island of Madagascar is\r\nanalogous to that of India; on the western side it resembles that of\r\nAfrica, though, as far as it is known, it seems to be a distinct centre\r\nof animal life. It has no ruminating animals; and the monkey tribe is\r\nrepresented by the Lemures and the Galagos, which are characteristic of\r\nthis fauna. A frugivorous bat, the size of a common fowl, forms an\r\narticle of food.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          AMERICAN QUADRUPEDS.\r\n\r\nNo species of animal has yet been extirpated in America, which is the\r\nrichest zoological province, possessing 537 species of mammalia, of\r\nwhich 480 are its own; yet no country has contributed so little to the\r\nstock of domestic animals. With the exception of the Llama and Alpaca,\r\nand the turkey, and perhaps some sheep and dogs, America has furnished\r\nno animal or bird serviceable to man, while it has received from Europe\r\nall its domestic animals and its civilized inhabitants.\r\n\r\nArctic America possesses most of the valuable fur-bearing animals that\r\nare in Siberia; and they were very plentiful till the unsparing\r\ndestruction of them has driven those yet remaining to the high\r\nlatitudes, where the hunters that follow them are exposed to great\r\nhardships. Nearly 6,000,000 of skins were brought to England in one\r\nyear, most of which were taken in the forest regions; the barren grounds\r\nare inhabited by the Arctic fox, the polar hare, by the brown and the\r\nwhite bear, a formidable animal which often lives on the ice itself. The\r\nreindeer lives on the lichens and mosses of these barren grounds, and\r\nwanders to the shores of the Polar Ocean: its southern limit in Europe\r\nis the Baltic Sea, in America it is the latitude of Quebec. Some of the\r\nfur-bearing quadrupeds of these deserts never pass the 65th degree of N.\r\nlat.; the greater number live in the northern forests, as the black\r\nbear, racoon, badger, the ermine, and four or five other members of the\r\nweasel tribe, the red fox, the polar and brown lynxes, the beaver, the\r\nmusquash or musk-rat, of which half a million are killed annually, and\r\nthe moose-deer, whose northern range ends where the aspen and willows\r\ncease to grow. The grizzly bear, the largest and most ferocious of its\r\nkind, inhabits the range of the Rocky Mountains to Mexico, as well as\r\nthe western savannahs. The prairie-wolf, the grey fox, the Virginian\r\nhare, live in the prairies; the Wapiti, a large stag, inhabits those on\r\nboth sides of the Rocky Mountains; and the Prongbuck, an antelope\r\nfleeter than a horse, roams throughout the western part of the\r\ncontinent, and migrates to California and Mexico in winter. The musk-ox\r\nand shaggy bison are peculiar to North America. The musk-ox travels to\r\nParry’s Islands in the Arctic regions, yet it never has been seen in\r\nGreenland or on the north-western side of the continent. The shaggy\r\nbison goes south to the Arkansas, roams in herds of thousands over the\r\nprairies of the Mississippi and on both sides of the Rocky Mountains. It\r\nnever wanders farther north than the 30th parallel, the southern limit\r\nof the musk-ox. A marmot known as the prairie-dog is universal.\r\n\r\nThere are at least eight varieties of American dogs, several of which\r\nare natives of the far north. The lagopus, or isatis, native in\r\nSpitzbergen and Greenland, is found in all the Arctic regions of America\r\nand Asia and in some of the Kurile Islands. Dogs are employed to draw\r\nsledges in Newfoundland and Canada; and the Esquimaux travel drawn by\r\ndogs as well as by reindeer. The dogs are strong and docile. The\r\nEsquimaux dogs were mute till they learned to bark from dogs in our\r\ndiscovery ships.\r\n\r\nThere are 13 species of the ruminating genus in North America, including\r\nthe bison, the musk-ox of the Arctic regions, the big-horned sheep, and\r\nthe goat of the Rocky Mountains. The horse, now roaming wild in\r\ninnumerable herds over the plains of South America, was unknown there\r\ntill the Spanish conquest. The quadrupeds of the temperate zone are\r\ndistributed in distinct groups: those of the state of New York,\r\nconsisting of about 40 species, are different from those of the Arctic\r\nregions, and also from those of South Carolina and Georgia; while in\r\nTexas another assemblage of species prevails. The Racoon, the\r\nCoatimondi, and the Kinkajou are all natives of the southern States.\r\n\r\nThere are 118 species of rodentia or gnawing animals in North America,\r\nrats, mice, squirrels, beavers, &c., many of which, especially in the\r\nnorth, appear to be identical with those in the high latitudes of Europe\r\nand Asia. The genera of very different latitudes are often\r\nrepresentative but never identical. Squirrels abound in North America;\r\nthe grey squirrel is found in thousands.\r\n\r\nThere are 21 species of Opossum in this continent, a family of the\r\npouched animals which are so peculiarly characteristic of Australia. Of\r\nthese, the Virginian opossum inhabits the whole extent of the American\r\ncontinent between the great Canadian lakes and Paraguay, and also the\r\nWest Indian islands, where it is called the manitu; and two other\r\nanimals of that order live in Mexico. There is a porcupine in the United\r\nStates and Canadian forests which climbs trees. The bats are different\r\nfrom those in Europe, and, excepting two, are very local. In California\r\nthere are ounces, polecats, the Berenda (an animal peculiar to that\r\ncountry), and a deer of remarkable size and speed.\r\n\r\nThe high land of Mexico forms a very decided line of division between\r\nthe fauna of North and that of the South America; yet some North\r\nAmerican animals are seen beyond it, particularly two of the bears, and\r\none of the otters, which inhabits the continent from the icy ocean to\r\nbeyond Brazil. On the other hand, the Puma, Jaguar, Opossum, Kinkajou,\r\nand Peccari, have crossed the barrier from South America to California\r\nand the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the varied and extensive regions of South America there are several\r\ncentres of a peculiar fauna, according as the country is mountainous or\r\nlevel, covered with forest or grass, fertile or desert, but the mammalia\r\nare inferior in size to those of the old world. The largest, most\r\npowerful, and perfect animals of this class are confined to the old\r\ncontinent. The South American quadrupeds are on a smaller scale, more\r\nfeeble and more gentle; many of them, as the toothless group and the\r\nsloths, are of anomalous and less perfect structure than the rest of the\r\nanimal creation, but the fauna of South America is so local and so\r\npeculiar, that the species of five of the terrestrial orders, which are\r\nindigenous there, are found nowhere else.\r\n\r\nThe monkey tribe are in myriads in the forests of tropical America and\r\nBrazil, but they never go north of the Isthmus of Darien, nor farther\r\nsouth than the Rio de la Plata. They differ widely from those in the old\r\nworld, bearing less resemblance to the human race, but they are more\r\ngentle and lively, and, notwithstanding their agility, are often a prey\r\nto the vulture and puma.\r\n\r\nThere are two great American families of four-handed animals—the\r\nsapajous with prehensile tails, by which they suspend themselves, and\r\nswing from bough to bough. Some of these inhabitants of the woods are\r\nvery noisy, especially the Argualis, a large ape whose bawling is heard\r\na mile off. The howlers are generally very large, and have a wider range\r\nthan any of the genus; one species, the Mycetus rufimanus or beelzebub,\r\nascends the Andes to the height of 11,000 feet. The cebus or weepers,\r\nwhich are frequently brought to Europe, belong also to this family; the\r\ngenus has a greater number of species than any other in the New World,\r\nbut a very narrow location; they are most abundant in Guiana.\r\n\r\nThe saquis or bushy-tailed monkeys form the other great American family.\r\nThe fox-monkey sleeps during the day; it frequents the deepest forests\r\nfrom the Orinoco to Paraguay. Squirrel-monkeys inhabit the banks of the\r\nOrinoco, and the night-monkeys, with very large eyes, live in Guiana and\r\nBrazil. The marmosets are pretty little animals, easily tamed,\r\nespecially the Midas leonina, not more than 7 or 8 inches long. Some\r\nAmerican monkeys have no thumb, others have a versatile thumb on both\r\ntheir hands and feet. In the New World the monkey tribe inhabit the\r\ncontinent from Honduras to beyond Brazil, in thousands, yet each kind\r\nhas its own peculiar location.\r\n\r\nThe forests are also inhabited by opossums, a family of the marsupial\r\ntribe, or animals with pouches, in which they carry their young; they\r\nare analogous to those which form the distinguishing feature of the\r\nAustralian fauna, but of distinct genera and species. Few of these\r\nanimals are larger than a rat, and they mostly live on trees, except one\r\nkind which is aquatic, found near the small streams from Honduras to\r\nBrazil. A species in Surinam carries its young upon its back; the\r\nelegant opossum is very numerous on the west side of the Andes, and\r\nthere only. All the opossums and the yassacks of this country have\r\nthumbs on their hind feet, opposite to the toes, so that they can grasp;\r\nthey are, moreover, distinguished from the Australian family by a long\r\nprehensile tail, and by greater agility. The numerous tribe of sapajou\r\nmonkeys, the ant-eaters, the kinkajou, and a species of porcupine, have\r\nalso grasping tails, a property of many South American animals.\r\n\r\nFive genera and 20 species of the Edentata are characteristic of this\r\ncontinent, and exclusively confined to South America: they are the\r\nsloths of two kinds, the ai and unau; the Armadilloes, Chlamyphores, and\r\nAnteaters. The animals of these five genera have very different habits:\r\nthe sloths, as their name implies, are the most inactive of animals;\r\nthey inhabit the forests from the southern limit of Mexico to Rio de\r\nJaneiro, and to the height of 3000 feet on the Andes in the region of\r\npalms and scitamineæ. Of these, the common sloth or Ai ranges from\r\nHonduras to Brazil; while the Unau, the larger of the two, is confined\r\nto Guiana. The Armadillo, in its coat of mail, is in perpetual motion,\r\nand can outrun a man in speed. They live on all the plains and\r\ntable-lands of South America even to Paraguay. The one-banded armadillo\r\nrolls itself up like a ball; the nine-banded species is eaten by the\r\nnatives; the giant armadillo, 3 feet long, inhabits the forests only.\r\nMost species of these animals are nocturnal, and burrow in the earth in\r\nthe Pampas. The chlamyphores are also burrowing animals, peculiar to the\r\nprovince of Cuyo on the eastern slope of the Chilian Andes; they have\r\nthe faculty of sitting upright. The ant-eater, larger than a\r\nNewfoundland dog, with shorter legs, defends itself against the jaguar\r\nwith its power claws; it inhabits the swampy savannahs and damp forests\r\nfrom Columbia to Paraguay, and from the Atlantic to the foot of the\r\nAndes; its flesh, like that of some other American animals, has a\r\nflavour of musk. The little ant-eater has a prehensile tail, and lives\r\non trees in the tropical forests, feeding on the larvæ of bees, wasps,\r\nhoney, and ants; another of similar habits lives in Brazil and Guiana.\r\nThe cat tribe in South America is beautiful and powerful: the Puma, the\r\nlion of America, is found both in the mountains and the plains, in great\r\nnumbers; so different are its habits in different places, that in Chile\r\nit is timid and flies from a dog; in Peru it is bold, though it rarely\r\nattacks a man. The Jaguar, which inhabits the lower forests, is very\r\nabundant, and so ferocious that it has been known to spring upon Indians\r\nin a canoe; hunting as it sometimes does in troops, it has been known to\r\ndestroy the inhabitants of entire Indian villages; it is one of the few\r\nSouth American animals that cross the Isthmus of Darien, being found in\r\nCalifornia, on the territory of the Mississippi, and has been seen in\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nThe vampire is a very large bat, much dreaded by the natives, because it\r\nenters their huts at night, and, though it seldom attacks human beings,\r\nit wounds calves and small animals, which sometimes die from the loss of\r\nblood. The other three South American bats are harmless.\r\n\r\nThe only ruminating animals that existed in South America prior to the\r\nConquest were the four species of the genus Auchenia—the Llama, the\r\nAlpaca, the Vicuña, and the Guanáco: the three first are exclusively\r\nconfined to the colder and more elevated regions of the Peruvian Andes;\r\nthe last has a wider geographical range, extending to the plains of\r\nPatagonia, and even to the southernmost extremity of the continent. The\r\nLlama inhabits the high valleys of the Peru-Bolivian Andes, its\r\nfavourite region being in the valley of the lake of Titicaca: it was the\r\nonly beast of burthen possessed by the aborigines; hence, we find it\r\nwherever the Incas carried their conquests and civilization, from the\r\nequator to beyond the southern tropic. It is still extensively employed\r\nby the Indian as a beast of burthen, and its wool, though coarse, is\r\nused by the aborigines: like all domestic animals, it varies in colour;\r\nits flesh is nauseous, black, and ill tasted.\r\n\r\nThe Alpaca, or paco, a gentle and handsome animal, although more closely\r\nallied to the llama than any of its congeners, is a distinct species: it\r\ninhabits at still more elevated places than the llama, its favourite\r\nhaunts being on the streams descending from the snowy peaks: it is only\r\nfound in a domestic state; it is reared for its wool, which is extremely\r\nfine, silky, and long, and which now bears a high price, from its\r\nintroduction into some of our finest woollen tissues. The vicuña is only\r\nfound in the wild state, in the plains on the Andes, as high as 1500\r\nfeet: its wool is much prized for its fineness. The animal has a shrill\r\nwhistle; it is easily domesticated. The Guanáco, by some naturalists\r\nconsidered erroneously as the parent stock of the llama and alpaca, is\r\nalso only found in the wild state: it is seen as far north as lat. 12°\r\nS., is very abundant and in large flocks on the Bolivian and Chilian\r\nAndes, and has been seen as far as the southern extremity of the\r\nAmerican continent. All these animals feed on a species of coarse wiry\r\ngrass called ichu.[185]\r\n\r\nSeveral species of deer are found in the tropical regions of South\r\nAmerica, and a remarkable species, with fragile hair like that of the\r\nroebuck, the cervus (Andium), as high as 11,000 feet in the Andes.\r\n\r\nThe rodentia, or gnawers, of South America, are very numerous; there are\r\n92 in Brazil alone: there are only 8 species of squirrels and 64 species\r\nof rats and mice, some of which are very peculiar.\r\n\r\nThe agoutis represent our hares in the plains of Patagonia, in Paraguay,\r\n&c., and extend as far as Guiana. The family of the cavias, or\r\nguinea-pigs, are found in Brazil, and some species in the great\r\ntable-lands of the Peru-Bolivian Andes; the Echymys, or spiny rat, is an\r\ninhabitant of the shores of the Rio de la Plata and Paraguay; the\r\nVizcacha of the pampas, a burrowing animal, inhabits the great plain of\r\nBuenos Ayres; an animal bearing the same name is frequent in the rocky\r\ndistricts of the Andes, as high as 15,000 feet above the sea; and the\r\nbeautiful Chinchilla, nearly allied to the latter, whose fur is so\r\nhighly esteemed, inhabits the same regions at the same great elevations\r\nin the Andes of Peru, Bolivia, and Chile: the best fur of the chinchilla\r\nis collected in the Bolivia province of Potosi, and in the Chilian\r\nprovince of Copiabo. The largest of all the rodentia, the Cabiai\r\n(Myopotamus), inhabits the banks of the great rivers of tropical\r\nAmerica, where its habits resemble, according to some travellers, those\r\nof the hippopotamus. The Paca, the next in size, is less aquatic in its\r\nhabits, and lives in the dense forests of Brazil and Paraguay.\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable that in a country which has the most luxuriant\r\nvegetation there should not be one species of hollow-horned ruminants,\r\nas the ox, sheep, goat, or antelope; and it is still more extraordinary\r\nthat the existing animals of South America, which are so nearly allied\r\nto the extinct inhabitants of the same soil, should be so inferior in\r\nsize not only to them, but even to the living quadrupeds of South\r\nAfrica, which is comparatively a desert. The quantity of vegetation in\r\nBritain at any one time exceeds the quantity on an equal area in the\r\ninterior of Africa ten-fold, yet Mr. Darwin has computed that the weight\r\nof 10 of the largest south African quadrupeds is 24 times greater than\r\nthat of the same number of quadrupeds of South America; for in South\r\nAmerica there is no animal the size of a cow, so that there is no\r\nrelation between the bulk of the species and the vegetation of the\r\ncountries they inhabit.\r\n\r\nThe largest animals indigenous in the West Indian islands are the\r\nAgouti, the Raccoon, the Houtias, a native of the forests of Cuba; the\r\nDidelphous carnivora and the Kinkajou are common also to the continent:\r\nthe kinkajou is a solitary instance of a carnivorous animal with a\r\nprehensile tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AUSTRALIAN QUADRUPEDS.\r\n\r\nAustralia is not farther separated from the rest of the world by\r\ngeographical position than by its productions. Its animals are creatures\r\nby themselves, of an entirely unusual type; few in species, and still\r\nfewer individually, if the vast extent of country be taken into\r\nconsideration; and there has not been one large animal discovered. There\r\nare only 53 species of land quadrupeds in New Holland, and there is not\r\na single example of the ruminating or pachydermatous animals, so useful\r\nto man, among them; there are no native horses, oxen, or sheep, yet all\r\nthese thrive and multiply on the grassy steppes of the country, which\r\nseem to be so well suited to them. There are none of the monkey tribe;\r\nindeed they could not exist in a country where there is no fruit.\r\n\r\nOf the species of indigenous quadrupeds, 40 are found nowhere else, and\r\n138 are marsupial or pouched animals, distinguished from all others by\r\ntheir young being, as it were, prematurely born and nourished in the\r\npouch till they are mature.[186] Though all the members of this numerous\r\nfamily agree in this circumstance, they are dissimilar in appearance,\r\ninternal structure, in their teeth and feet, consequently in their\r\nhabits; two genera live on vegetable food, one set are gnawers and\r\nanother toothless. The Kangaroo and the kangaroo-rat walk on their hind\r\nlegs, and go by bounds, aided by their strong tail; the rat holds its\r\nfood in its hands like the squirrel; the opossum walks on all fours; the\r\nphalangers live on trees, and swing by their bushy tail, some burrow in\r\nthe sand; the flying opossum or Phalanger, peculiarly an Australian\r\nanimal, lives on the leaves of the gum-tree; by expanding the skin of\r\nits sides it supports itself in the air in its leaps from bough to\r\nbough. Several of the genera come out at night only, a characteristic of\r\nmany Australian animals.\r\n\r\nThe pouched tribe vary in size from that of a large dog to a mouse; the\r\nkangaroos, which are the largest, are easily domesticated, and are used\r\nfor food by the natives. Some go in large herds in the mountains, others\r\nlive in the plains; however, they have become scarce near the British\r\ncolonies, and, with all other native animals, are likely to be\r\nextirpated. In Van Diemen’s Land they are less persecuted; several\r\nspecies exist there. The kangaroos, of which there are 40 species, are\r\nmore widely dispersed than any of the marsupial animals of the old\r\nworld. They exist not only in New Holland and Van Diemen’s Land, but\r\nalso in New Guinea and Java. Some are limited within narrow bounds: the\r\nbanded kangaroo, the handsomest of his tribe, is found only in the\r\nislands of Shark’s Bay, on the west coast of Australia. The Wombat is\r\npeculiar to Australia, the islands in Bass’s Strait, and Van Diemen’s\r\nLand; to which the two largest carnivorous marsupials peculiarly belong,\r\ncalled by the natives the tiger hyæna, and the native devil; both are\r\nnocturnal, predatory, and ferocious. A wild dog in the woods, whose\r\nhabits are ferocious, is, with the tiger hyæna, the largest carnivorous\r\nanimal in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe gnawing animals are aquatic and very peculiar, but the edentata of\r\nNew Holland are quite anomalous; of these there are two genera, the\r\nOrnithorhynchus, or duck-billed mole, and the Echidna: they are the link\r\nthat connects the edentata with the pouched tribe, and mammal with\r\noviparous animals. The ornithorhynchus is about 14 inches long, and\r\ncovered with thick brown fur; its head is similar to that of a\r\nquadruped, ending in a bill like that of a duck: it has short furry legs\r\nwith half-webbed feet, and the hind feet are armed with sharp claws. It\r\ninhabits burrows on the banks of rivers, which have two entrances, one\r\nabove, the other below the level of the water, which it seldom leaves,\r\nfeeding on insects and seeds in the mud.\r\n\r\nThe echidna is similar in its general structure to the ornithorhynchus,\r\nbut entirely different in external appearance, being covered with quills\r\nlike the porcupine; it is also a burrowing animal, sleeps during winter,\r\nand lives on ants in summer.\r\n\r\nA singular analogy exists between Australia and South America in this\r\nrespect, that the living animals of the two countries are stamped with\r\nthe type of their ancient geological inhabitants, while in England and\r\nelsewhere the difference between the existing and extinct generations of\r\nbeings is most decided. Australia and South America seem still to retain\r\nsome of those conditions that were peculiar to the most ancient eras.\r\nThus, each tribe of the innumerable families that inhabit the earth, the\r\nair, and the waters, has a limited sphere. How wonderful the quantity of\r\nlife that now is, and the myriads of beings that have appeared and\r\nvanished![187] Dust has returned to dust through a long succession of\r\nages, and has been continually remoulded into new forms of existence—not\r\nan atom has been annihilated; the fate of the vital spark that has\r\nanimated it, with a vividness sometimes approaching to reason, is one of\r\nthe deep mysteries of Providence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nThe Distribution, Condition, and future Prospects of the Human Race.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE than 800,000,000 of human beings are scattered over the face of the\r\nearth, of all nations and kindreds and tongues, and in all stages of\r\ncivilization, from a high state of moral and intellectual culture, to\r\nsavages but little above the animals that contend with them for the\r\ndominion of the deserts and forests through which they roam. This vast\r\nmultitude is divided into nations and tribes, differing in external\r\nappearance, character, language, and religion. The manner in which they\r\nare distributed, the affinities of structure and language by which they\r\nare connected, and the effect that climate, food, and customs may have\r\nhad in modifying their external forms, or their moral and mental powers,\r\nare subjects of much more difficulty than the geographical dispersion of\r\nthe lower classes of animals, inasmuch as the immortal spirit is the\r\nchief agent in all that concerns the human race. The progress of the\r\nuniversal mind in past ages, its present condition, and the future\r\nprospects of humanity, rouse the deep sympathies of our nature, for the\r\nhigh but mysterious destiny of the myriads of beings yet to come, who,\r\nlike ourselves, will be subject for a few brief years to the joys and\r\nsorrows of this transient state, and fellow-heirs of eternal life\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the extreme diversity, personal and mental, in mankind,\r\nanatomists have found that there are no specific differences—that the\r\nhideous Esquimaux, the refined and intellectual Caucasian, the\r\nthick-lipped Negro, and the fair blue-eyed Scannavian, are mere\r\nvarieties of the same species. The human race forms five great varieties\r\nmarked by strong distinctive characters. Many nations are included in\r\neach; distinguished from one another by different languages, manners,\r\nand mental qualities, yet bearing such a resemblance in general\r\nphysiognomy and appearance as to justify a classification apparently\r\nanomalous.\r\n\r\nThe Caucasian group of nations, which includes the handsomest and most\r\nintellectual portion of mankind, inhabit all Europe, except Lapland,\r\nFinland, and Hungary; they occupy North Africa, as far as the 20th\r\nparallel of north latitude, Arabia, Asia Minor, Persia, the Himalaya to\r\nthe Brahmapootra, all India between these mountains and the ocean, and\r\nthe United States of North America. These nations are remarkable for a\r\nbeautifully-shaped small head, regular features, fine hair, and\r\nsymmetrical form. The Greeks, Georgians, and Circassians are models of\r\nperfection in form, especially the last, which is assumed as the type of\r\nthis class of mankind; of which it is evident that colour is not a\r\ncharacteristic, since they are of all shades, from the fair and florid,\r\nto the clear dark brown and almost black. This family of nations has\r\nalways been, and still is, the most civilized portion of the human race.\r\nThe inhabitants of Hindostan, the Egyptians, Arabians, Greeks, and\r\nRomans, were in ancient times what the European nations are now. The\r\ncause of this remarkable development of mental power is, no doubt,\r\nnatural disposition, for the difference in the capabilities of nations\r\nseems to be as great as that of individuals. The origin of spontaneous\r\ncivilization and superiority may generally be traced to the talent of\r\nsome master-spirit gaining an ascendancy over his countrymen. Natural\r\ncauses have also combined with mental—mildness of climate, fertility of\r\nsoil; rivers and inland seas, by affording facility of intercourse,\r\nfavoured enterprise and commerce; and the double-river systems in Asia\r\nbrought distant nations together, and softened those hostile antipathies\r\nwhich separate people, multiply languages, and reduce all to barbarism.\r\nThe genius of this family of nations has led them to profit by these\r\nnatural advantages; whereas the American Indians are at this day\r\nwandering as barbarous hordes in one of the finest countries in the\r\nworld. An original similarity or even identity of many spoken languages\r\nmay be adverted to as facilitating communication and mental improvement\r\namong the Caucasian variety in very ancient times.\r\n\r\nThe Mongol-Tartar family forms the second group of nations. They occupy\r\nall Asia north of the Persian table-land and of the Himalaya; the whole\r\nof Eastern Asia from the Brahmapootra to Behring’s Straits, together\r\nwith the Arctic regions of America north of Labrador. This family\r\nincludes the Tourkomans, Mongol and Tartar tribes, the Chinese,\r\nIndo-Chinese, Japanese, the Esquimaux, and the Hungarians, now located\r\nin the very heart of Europe. These nations are distinguished by broad\r\nskulls and high cheek-bones, small black eyes obliquely set, long black\r\nhair, and a yellow or sallow olive complexion; some are good-looking,\r\nand many are well-made. A portion of this family is capable of high\r\nculture, especially the Chinese, the most civilized nation of eastern\r\nAsia, although they never have attained the excellence of the Caucasian\r\ngroup, probably from their exclusive social system, which has separated\r\nthem from the rest of mankind, and kept them stationary for ages; the\r\npeculiarity and difficulty of their language have also tended to\r\ninsulate them. The Kalmuks, who lead a pastoral wandering life on the\r\nsteppes of central Asia, and the Esquimaux, have wider domains than any\r\nother of this set of nations. The Kalmuks are rather a handsome people,\r\nand, like all who lead a savage life, have acute senses of seeing and\r\nhearing. The inhabitants of Finland and Lapland are nearly allied to the\r\nEsquimaux, who are spread over all the high latitudes of both\r\ncontinents—a diminutive race, equally ugly in face and form.\r\n\r\nMalayan nations occupy the Indian Archipelago, New Zealand, Chatham\r\nIsland, the Society group, and several other of the Polynesian islands,\r\ntogether with the Phillipines and Formosa. They are very dark, with lank\r\ncoarse black hair, flat faces, and obliquely set eyes. Endowed with\r\ngreat activity and ingenuity, they are mild and gentle, and far advanced\r\nin the arts of social life, in some places; in others, ferocious and\r\nvindictive, daring and predatory; and from their maritime position and\r\nskill, they are a migratory race. Several branches of this class of\r\nnations had a very early indigenous civilization, with an original\r\nliterature in peculiar characters of their own.\r\n\r\nThe Ethiopian nations are widely dispersed; they occupy all Africa south\r\nof the Great Desert, half of Madagascar, the continent of Australia,\r\nMindanao, Gilolo, the high lands of Borneo, Sumbawa, Timor, and New\r\nIreland. The distinguishing characters of this group are, a black\r\ncomplexion, black woolly or frizzled hair, thick lips, projecting jaws,\r\nhigh cheek-bones, and large prominent eyes. A great variety, however,\r\nexists in this jetty race: some are handsome both in face and figure,\r\nespecially in Ethiopia; and even in Western Africa, where the Negro\r\ntribes live, there are groups in which the distinctive characters are\r\nless exaggerated. This great family has not yet attained a high place\r\namong nations, though by no means incapable of cultivation; part of\r\nEthiopia appears to have made considerable progress in civilization in\r\nvery ancient times. But the formidable deserts, so extensive in some\r\nparts of the continent, and the unwholesome climate in others, have cut\r\noff intercourse with civilized nations; and, unfortunately, the infamous\r\ntraffic in slaves, to the disgrace of Christianity, has made the nations\r\nof tropical Africa more barbarous than they were before: while, on the\r\ncontrary, the Foulahs and other tribes who were converts to\r\nMahommedanism 400 years ago, have now large commercial towns, cultivated\r\ngrounds, and schools. The Australians and Papuans, who inhabit the\r\neastern islands mentioned, are the most degraded of this dark race, and\r\nindeed of all mankind.\r\n\r\nThe American race, who occupy the whole of that continent from 62° N.\r\nlat. to the Straits of Magellan, are almost all of a reddish brown or\r\ncopper colour, with long black hair, deep-set black eyes, aquiline nose,\r\nand often of handsome slender forms. In North America they live by\r\nhunting, are averse to agriculture, slow in acquiring knowledge, but\r\nextremely acute, brave, and fond of war, and, though revengeful, are\r\ncapable of generosity and gratitude. In South America many are\r\nhalf-civilized, but a greater number are still in a state of utter\r\nbarbarism. In a family so widely scattered great diversity of character\r\nprevails, yet throughout the whole there is a similarity of manners and\r\nhabits which has resisted all the effects of time and climate.\r\n\r\nEach of these five groups of nations, spread over vast regions, is\r\naccounted one family; and if they are so by physical structure, they are\r\nstill more so by language, which expresses the universal mind of a\r\npeople, modified by external circumstances, of which none have a greater\r\ninfluence than the geographical features of the country they inhabit—an\r\ninfluence that is deepest in the early stages of society. The remnants\r\nof ancient poetry in the south of Scotland partake of the gentle and\r\npastoral character of the country; while Celtic verse, and even the\r\nspoken language of the Highlander, are full of poetical images of war\r\nand stern mountain scenery. This is particularly to be observed in the\r\nnoble strains of Homer, and in the heroic poems of the early Hindus,\r\nwhich reflect the lofty and sublime character of eastern scenery.[188]\r\nAs civilization advances, and man becomes more intellectual, language\r\nkeeps pace in the progress. New words and new expressions are added, as\r\nnew ideas occur and new things are invented, till at last language\r\nitself becomes a study, is refined and perfected by the introduction of\r\ngeneral terms. The improvement in language and the development of the\r\nmind have been the same in all nations which have arrived at any degree\r\nof refinement, and shows the identity of human nature in every country\r\nand climate. The art of printing perpetuates a tongue, and great authors\r\nimmortalize it; yet language is ever changing to a certain degree,\r\nthough it never loses traces of its origin. Chaucer and Spenser have\r\nbecome obscure; Shakespeare requires a glossary for the modern reader;\r\nand in the few years that the United States of America have existed as\r\nan independent nation, the colloquial language has deviated from the\r\nmother-tongue. When a nation degenerates, it is split by jealousy and\r\nwar into tribes, each of which, in process of time, acquires a peculiar\r\nidiom, and thus the number of dialects is increased, though they still\r\nretain a similarity; whereas when masses of mankind are united into\r\ngreat political bodies, their languages by degrees assimilate to one\r\ncommon tongue, which retains traces of all to the latest ages. The form\r\nof the dialects now spoken by some savage tribes, as the North American\r\nIndians, bears the marks of a once higher state of civilization.\r\n\r\nMore than 2000 languages are spoken, but few are independent; some are\r\nconnected by words having the same meaning, some by grammatical\r\nstructure, others by both; indeed the permanency of language is so\r\ngreat, that neither ages of conquest, nor mixing with other nations,\r\nhave obliterated the native idiom of a people. The French, Spanish, and\r\nGerman retain traces of the common language spoken before the Roman\r\nconquest, and the Celtic tongue still exists in the British Islands.\r\n\r\nBy a comparison of their dialects, nations far apart, and differing in\r\nevery other respect, are discovered to have sprung from a common, though\r\nremote origin. Thus, all the numerous languages spoken by the American\r\nIndians, or red men, are similar in grammatical structure: an intimate\r\nanalogy exists in the languages of the Esquimaux nations who inhabit the\r\narctic regions of both continents. Dialects of one tongue are spoken\r\nthroughout North Africa, as far south as the oasis of Siwah on the east,\r\nand the Canary Islands on the west. Another group of cognate idioms is\r\ncommon to the inhabitants of Equatorial Africa, while all the southern\r\npart of the continent is inhabited by people whose languages are\r\nconnected. The monosyllabic speech of the Chinese and Indo-Chinese shows\r\nthat they are the same people; and all the insular nations of the\r\nPacific derived their dialects from some tribes on the continent of\r\nIndia and the Indian Archipelago. Cognate tongues are spoken by the\r\nTartars, Mandtchoux, Fins, Laplanders, many of the Siberian nations, and\r\nby the Hungarians.\r\n\r\nThe Persian, Arabic, Greek, Latin, German, and Celtic tongues are\r\nconnected by grammatical structure, and words expressive of the same\r\nobjects and feelings, with the Sanscrit, or sacred language of India;\r\nconsequently, the nations inhabiting that vast extent of country from\r\nthe mouths of the Ganges to the British Isles, the coast of Scandinavia\r\nand Iceland, must have had the same origin. “The words that fall\r\nthoughtlessly from our lips in the daily vocations of life are no idle\r\nsounds, but magic symbols which preserve for ever the first migrations\r\nof the race, and whose antiquity makes Greece and Rome appear but of\r\nyesterday.”\r\n\r\nThe number of languages spoken from the Ganges to Scandinavia, differing\r\nso widely from one another, is a proof of the strength of individual\r\ncharacter in nations, which can so powerfully impress its peculiarities\r\non the same mother tongue. In fact every nation, as well as every\r\nindividual, has its own physical, moral, and intellectual organization,\r\nwhich influences its language and its whole existence.\r\n\r\nIn the Indo-Germanic nations, which have been dominant for ages,\r\ncivilization has been progressive, though not without interruptions.\r\nProvidence has endowed these nations with the richest and most\r\nornamental gifts. Imagination has been liberally granted, and embodied\r\nin all that is sublime and beautiful in architecture, sculpture,\r\npainting, and poetry. In strength of intellect and speculation, in\r\nphilosophy, science, laws, and the political principles of society, they\r\nhave been pre-eminent.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing races of mankind now inhabiting Europe are the Teutonic,\r\nCeltic, and Sclavonian. In the greater part of the continent these races\r\nare mixed, but the blood is purely Teutonic throughout Iceland,\r\nScandinavia, round the Gulf of Bothnia, in Denmark, Germany, and the\r\neast of England from Portsmouth to the Tyne. Pure Celtic blood is\r\nconfined to the Basque Provinces in Spain, the south and south-west of\r\nFrance, a part of the Grisons and Switzerland, and some part of Great\r\nBritain. The Sclavonian blood is widely dispersed in middle Russia, from\r\nthe Ural Mountains to the west of the Valdai table-land, and from\r\nNovogorod to the lower course of the Don. The three races have been much\r\nimproved by mixture, in appearance, energy, and versatility of mind.\r\n\r\nIt is extraordinary that nations should lose their vitality without any\r\napparent cause; throughout the Indian Archipelago there is no longer any\r\none great Malayan nation, in Europe pure Celtic blood has been on the\r\ndecline for twenty centuries, and even the mixed Celtic variety has not\r\nincreased in proportion to the Teutonic, although for 2000 years they\r\nhave been exposed to the same external circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt present the Teutonic race, including the inhabitants of North America\r\nand the British colonies, considerably outnumber the Celtic, though its\r\nnumbers were far inferior in ancient times. The Teutonic variety has\r\nsubdued and even exterminated the other varieties in its progress\r\ntowards the west; it is undoubtedly the most vigorous, both in body and\r\nmind, of all mankind, and seems destined to conquer and civilize the\r\nwhole world. It is a singular fact, whatever the cause may be, that the\r\nCelts are invariably Catholic, while the Teutonic population is inclined\r\nto Protestantism.\r\n\r\nVarious other races inhabit Europe, much inferior in numbers to those\r\nabove mentioned, though occasionally mixed with them, as the Turks,\r\nFins, the Samojedes, who live on the shores of the White Sea and in the\r\nnorth-east of Russia, and the Hungarians, the higher class of which are\r\na fine race of men, and on a par with the most civilized of the European\r\nnations. There are many mixed Tartar tribes, chiefly in the south and\r\neast of the Russian territories; also Jews and Gipsies, who live among\r\nall nations, yet mix with none.[189]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Great Britain are of Celtic and Teutonic origin. The\r\nCeltic blood is purest in Cornwall and the Scilly Islands, in Wales, and\r\nthe Isle of Man: in the highlands of Scotland and the Hebrides it is\r\nmore mixed than is generally supposed, as plainly appears from the\r\nfrequency of red hair and blue eyes. In some parts of Ireland there is\r\npure Celtic blood, but throughout the greater part of that country it is\r\nmixed, although the Celtic character predominates; but in Ulster, where\r\nthe earliest colony settled, the blood is purely Teutonic. In Ireland\r\nthe difference in the organization of the two races is strongly marked:\r\nplaced under the same circumstances, the Teutonic part of the population\r\nhas prospered, which, unfortunately, has not been the case with the\r\nCeltic.[190]\r\n\r\nThe dialects spoken in the Celtic districts are closely allied to the\r\nSemitic languages of Asia, and to one another. The Cornish is worn out,\r\nthe Manx is nearly so, and the Gaelic is declining fast in the highlands\r\nof Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe Roman invasion had no effect on the Anglo-Saxon or old English, a\r\nlanguage of Teutonic origin, but the Normans in ancient times had\r\naltered it considerably, and in modern times the English tongue has\r\nunfortunately been corrupted by the introduction of French, Latin, and\r\nLatinized words. Scotch spoken throughout the Lowlands of Scotland is a\r\nlanguage independent of the English, though of the same stock; it is\r\nderived from the low German, the Frisian, Dutch, and Flemish, and\r\ndiffers widely from the Anglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\nNo circumstance in the natural world is more inexplicable than the\r\ndiversity of form and colour in the human race. It had already begun in\r\nthe antediluvian world, for “there were giants in the land in those\r\ndays.” No direct mention is made of colour at that time, unless the mark\r\nset upon Cain, “lest any one finding him should kill him,” may allude to\r\nit. Perhaps, also, it may be inferred that black people dwelt in\r\nEthiopia, or the land of Cush, which means black in the Hebrew language.\r\nAt all events, the difference now existing must have arisen after the\r\nflood, consequently all must have originated with Noah, whose wife, or\r\nthe wives of his sons, may have been of different colours, for aught we\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nMany instances have occurred in modern times, of albinos and red-haired\r\nchildren having been born of black parents, and these have transmitted\r\ntheir peculiarities to their descendants for several generations, but it\r\nmay be doubted whether pure-blooded white people have had perfectly\r\nblack offspring. The varieties are much more likely to have arisen from\r\nthe effects of climate, food, customs, and civilization upon migratory\r\ngroups of mankind; and of such, a few instances have occurred in\r\nhistorical times, limited, however, to small numbers and particular\r\nspots; but the great mass of nations had received their distinctive\r\ncharacters at a very early period. The permanency of type is one of the\r\nmost striking circumstances, and proves the length of time necessary to\r\nproduce a change in national structure and colour. A nation of\r\nEthiopians existed 3450 years ago, which emigrated from a remote country\r\nand settled near Egypt, and there must have been black people before the\r\nage of Solomon, otherwise he would not have alluded to colour, even\r\npoetically. The national appearance of the Ethiopians, Persians, and\r\nJews, has not varied for more than 3000 years, as appears from the\r\nancient Egyptian paintings in the tomb of Rhameses the Great, discovered\r\nat Thebes by Belzoni, in which the countenance of the modern Ethiopian\r\nand Persian can be readily recognized, and the Jewish features and\r\ncolour are identical with those of the Israelites daily met with in\r\nLondon. Civilization is supposed to have great influence on colour,\r\nhaving a tendency to make the dark shade more general, and it appears\r\nthat, in the crossing of two shades, the offspring takes the complexion\r\nof the darker and the form of the fairer. But as there is no instance of\r\na new variety of mankind having been established as a nation since the\r\nChristian era, there must either have been a greater energy in the\r\ncauses of change before that time, or, brief as the span of man on earth\r\nhas been, a wrong estimate of time antecedent to the Christian period\r\nmust have made it shorter.[191]\r\n\r\nDarkness of complexion has been attributed to the sun’s power from the\r\nage of Solomon to this day—“Look not upon me, because I am black,\r\nbecause the sun hath looked upon me;” and there can be no doubt that, to\r\na certain degree, the opinion is well founded. The invisible rays in the\r\nsolar beams, which change vegetable colours, and have been employed with\r\nsuch remarkable effect in the Daguerreotype, act upon every substance on\r\nwhich they fall, producing mysterious and wonderful changes in their\r\nmolecular state—man not excepted.[192]\r\n\r\nOther causes must have been combined to occasion all the varieties we\r\nnow see, otherwise every nation between the tropics would be of the same\r\nhue, whereas the sooty Negro inhabits equatorial Africa, the Red man\r\nequinoctial America, and both are mixed with fairer tribes. In Asia, the\r\nRohillas, a fair race of Affghan extraction, inhabit the plains north of\r\nthe Ganges: the Bengalee and the mountaineers of Nepaul are dark, and\r\nthe Mahrattas are yellow. The complexion of man varies with height and\r\nlatitude; some of the inhabitants of the Himalaya and Hindoo Koosh are\r\nfair, and even a red-haired race is found on the latter. There are\r\nfair-haired people with blue eyes in the Ruddhua mountains in Africa.\r\nThe Kabyles, that inhabit the country behind Tunis and Algiers, are\r\nsimilar in complexion to the nations in high northern latitudes. This\r\ncorrespondence, however, only maintains with regard to the northern\r\nhemisphere, for it is a well-known fact that the varieties of the\r\nnumerous species in the great southern continents are much more similar\r\nin physical characters to the native races of the torrid zone, than any\r\nof the aboriginal people of the northern regions. Even supposing that\r\ndiversity of colour is owing to the sun’s rays only, it is scarcely\r\npossible to attribute the thick lips, the woolly hair, and the entire\r\ndifference of form, extending even to the very bones and skull, to\r\nanything but a concurrence of circumstances, not omitting the invisible\r\ninfluence of electricity, which pervades every part of the earth and\r\nair—and possibly terrestrial magnetism.\r\n\r\nThe flexibility of man’s constitution enables him to live in every\r\nclimate, from the equator to the ever-frozen coasts of Nova Zembla and\r\nSpitzbergen, and that chiefly by his capability of bearing the most\r\nextreme changes of temperature and diet, which are probably the\r\nprincipal causes of the variety in his form. It has already been\r\nmentioned that oxygen is inhaled with the atmospheric air, and also\r\ntaken in by the pores on the skin; part of it combines chemically with\r\nthe carbon of the food, and is expired in the form of carbonic acid gas\r\nand water; that chemical action is the cause of vital force and heat in\r\nman and animals. The quantity of food must be in exact proportion to the\r\nquantity of oxygen inhaled, otherwise disease and loss of strength would\r\nbe the consequence. Since cold air is incessantly carrying off warmth\r\nfrom the skin, more exercise is requisite in winter than in summer, in\r\ncold climates than in warm; consequently, more carbon is necessary in\r\nthe former than in the latter, in order to maintain the chemical action\r\nthat generates heat, and to ward off the destructive effects of the\r\noxygen, which incessantly strives to consume the body. Animal food,\r\nwine, and spirits, contain many times more carbon than fruit and\r\nvegetables, therefore animal food is much more necessary in a cold than\r\nin a hot climate. The esquimaux, who lives by the chace, and eats 10 or\r\n12 pounds weight of meat and fat in 24 hours, finds it not more than\r\nenough to keep up his strength and animal heat, while the indolent\r\ninhabitant of Bengal is sufficiently supplied with both by his rice\r\ndiet. Clothing and warmth make the necessity for exercise and food much\r\nless, by diminishing the waste of animal heat. Hunger and cold united\r\nsoon consume the body, because it loses its power of resisting the\r\naction of the oxygen, which consumes part of our substance, when food is\r\nwanting. Hence, nations inhabiting warm climates have no great merit in\r\nbeing abstemious, nor are those guilty of committing an excess who live\r\nmore freely in colder countries. The arrangement of Divine Wisdom is to\r\nbe admired in this as in all other things, for, if man had only been\r\ncapable of living on vegetable food, he never could have had a permanent\r\nresidence beyond the latitude where corn ripens. The Esquimaux, and all\r\nthe inhabitants of the very high latitudes of both continents, live\r\nentirely on fish and animal food. What effects the difference of food\r\nmay have upon the intellect is not known.\r\n\r\nA nation or tribe driven by war, or any other cause, from a warm to a\r\ncold country, or the contrary, would be forced to change their food both\r\nin quality and quantity, which in the lapse of ages might produce an\r\nalteration in the external form and internal structure. The probability\r\nis still greater, if the entire change that a few years produces in the\r\nmatter of which the human frame is composed be considered. At every\r\ninstant during life, with every motion, voluntary and involuntary, with\r\nevery thought and every exercise of the brain, a portion of our\r\nsubstance becomes dead, separates from the living part, combines with\r\nsome of the inhaled oxygen, and is removed. By this process it is\r\nsupposed that the whole body is renewed every 7 years; individuality,\r\ntherefore, depends on the spirit, which retains its identity during all\r\nthe changes of its earthly house, and sometimes even acts independently\r\nof it. When sleep is restoring exhausted nature, the spirit is often\r\nawake and active, crowding the events of years into a few seconds, and,\r\nby its unconsciousness of time, anticipates eternity. Every change of\r\nfood, climate, and mental excitement, must have their influence on the\r\nreproduction of the mortal frame; and thus a thousand causes may\r\nco-operate to alter whole races of mankind placed under new\r\ncircumstances, time being granted.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the effects of manual labour and the efforts of\r\nthe brain appears in the intellectual countenance of the educated man,\r\ncompared with that of the peasant, though even he is occasionally\r\nstamped with nature’s own nobility. The most savage people are also the\r\nugliest. Their countenance is deformed by violent unsubdued passions,\r\nanxiety, and suffering. Deep sensibility gives a beautiful and varied\r\nexpression, but every strong emotion is unfavourable to perfect\r\nregularity of feature; and of that the Greeks were well aware when they\r\ngave that calmness of expression and repose to their unrivalled statues.\r\nThe refining effects of high culture, and, above all, the Christian\r\nreligion, by subduing the evil passions, and encouraging the good, are\r\nmore than anything calculated to improve even the external appearance.\r\nThe countenance, though perhaps of less regular form, becomes expressive\r\nof the amiable and benevolent feelings of the heart, the most\r\ncaptivating and lasting of all beauty.[193]\r\n\r\nThus, an infinite assemblage of causes may be assigned as having\r\nproduced the endless varieties in the human race; but the fact remains\r\nan inscrutable mystery. But amidst all the physical vicissitudes man has\r\nundergone, the species remains permanent; and let those who think that\r\nthe difference in the species of animals and vegetables arises from\r\ndiversity of conditions, consider, that no circumstances whatever can\r\ndegrade the form of man to that of the monkey—or elevate the monkey to\r\nthe form of man.\r\n\r\nAnimals and vegetables, being the sources of man’s sustenance, have had\r\nthe chief influence on his destiny and location, and have induced him to\r\nsettle in those parts of the world where he could procure them in\r\ngreatest abundance. Wherever the chace or the spontaneous productions of\r\nthe earth supply him with food, he is completely savage, and only a\r\ndegree further advanced where he plants the palm and the banana; where\r\ngrain is the principal food, industry and intelligence are most\r\nperfectly developed, as in the temperate zone. On that account the\r\ncentres of civilization have generally been determined, not by a hot,\r\nbut by a genial climate, fertile soil, by the vicinity of the sea-coast\r\nor great rivers, affording the means of fishing and transport, which\r\nlast has been one of the chief causes of the superiority of Europe and\r\nSouthern Asia. The mineral treasures of the earth have been the means of\r\nassembling great masses of men in Siberia and the table-land of the\r\nAndes, and have given rise to many great cities, both in the Old and the\r\nNew World. Nations inhabiting elevated table-lands and high ungenial\r\nlatitudes have been driven there by war, or obliged to wander from\r\ncountries where the population exceeded the means of living—a cause of\r\nmigration to which both language and tradition bear testimony. The\r\nbelief in a future state, so universal, shown by respect for the dead,\r\nhas no doubt been transmitted from nation to nation. The American\r\nIndians, driven from their hunting-grounds, still make pilgrimages to\r\nthe tombs of their fathers; and these tribes alone, of all uncivilized\r\nmankind, worship the Great Spirit as the invisible God and Father of\r\nall—a degree of abstract refinement which could hardly have sprung up\r\nspontaneously among a rude people, and which must have been transmitted\r\nfrom races who held the Jewish faith.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that America had been peopled from Asia before the\r\nseparation of the continents by Behring’s Straits, and there is reason\r\nto believe that the location of various races of mankind, now insulated,\r\nmay have taken place before the separation of the lands by mediterranean\r\nseas; whilst others, previously insulated, may be now united by the\r\ndrying up of inland seas, as those which covered the Sahara desert, and\r\nthe great hollow round the Caspian Sea, of which it and the Black Sea\r\nare probably the remnants.\r\n\r\nM. Boué has observed that mountain chains running nearly east and west\r\nestablish much more striking differences among nations than those which\r\nextend from north to south—a circumstance confirmed by observation\r\nthrough the history of mankind. The Scandinavian Alps have not prevented\r\nthe countries on both sides from being occupied by people of a common\r\ndescent; while the feeble barrier of the Cheviot Hills, between England\r\nand Scotland, and the moderate elevation of the Highland mountains, have\r\nprevented the amalgamation of the Anglo-Saxons and the Celts, even in a\r\nperiod of high civilization. The Franks and Belgians are distinct,\r\nthough separated by hills of still less elevation. For the same reason\r\nthe Spaniards and Italians differ far more from their neighbours on the\r\nother side of the eastern and western chains, than the Spaniards do from\r\nthe Portuguese, or the Piedmontese from the Provençals. A similar\r\ndistinction prevails throughout Asia; and in America, where all the\r\nprincipal chains run north and south, there is but one copper-coloured\r\nrace throughout the continent, which stretches over more climates than\r\nEurope and Africa, or even than Asia and Australia, united. It is along\r\nchains running north and south that the fusion of languages takes place,\r\nand not along those of an easterly and westerly direction. From Poland,\r\nfor instance, there are intermediate insensible gradations through\r\nGermany into France; while in crossing from a German district of the\r\nAlps to the valleys of Italy, different tribes and different languages\r\nare separated by a single mountain. Even wars and conquest have ever\r\nbeen more easy in one direction than in the other. The difference in the\r\nfauna and flora on the two sides of the great table-land and mountains\r\nof Asia is a striking illustration of the influence which high lands\r\nrunning east and west have on natural productions, and thus, both\r\ndirectly and indirectly, they affect the distribution of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which thus determine the location of nations, and the\r\nfusion or separation of their languages, must, conjointly with moral\r\ncauses, operate powerfully on their character. The minds of mankind, as\r\nwell as their fate, are influenced by the soil on which they are born\r\nand bred. The natives of elevated countries are attached to their\r\nmountains; the Dutch are as much attached to their meadows and canals;\r\nand the savage, acquainted only with the discomforts of life, is unhappy\r\nwhen brought among civilized man. Early associations never entirely\r\nleave us, however much our position in life may alter, and strong\r\nattachments are formed to places which generate in us habits differing\r\nfrom those of other countries.\r\n\r\nThe Baltic and Mediterranean Seas have had no inconsiderable share in\r\ncivilizing Europe; one combined with a cold and gloomy climate, the\r\nother with a warm and glowing sky, have developed dissimilar characters\r\nin the temperament and habits of the surrounding nations, originally\r\ndissimilar in race. The charms of climate, and the ease with which the\r\nnecessaries of life are procured, were favourable to the development of\r\nimagination in the more southern nations, and to an indolent enjoyment\r\nof their advantages. In the north, on the contrary, the task imposed\r\nupon man was harder, and perhaps more favourable to strength of\r\ncharacter. The Dutch owe their industry and perseverance to their\r\nunceasing struggle against the encroachments of the ocean; the British\r\nare indebted to their insular position for their maritime disposition,\r\nand to the smallness of their country and the richness of their mines,\r\nfor their manufacturing and colonizing habits; the military propensities\r\nof the French, to the necessity of maintaining their independence among\r\nthe surrounding nations, as well as to ambition and the love of fame.\r\n\r\nThus, external circumstances materially modify the character of nations,\r\nbut the original propensities of race are never eradicated, and they are\r\nnowhere more prominent than in the progress of the social state in\r\nFrance and England. The vivacity and speculative disposition of the Celt\r\nappear in the rapid and violent changes of government and in the\r\nsuccession of theoretical experiments in France; while in Britain the\r\ndeliberate slowness, prudence, and accurate perceptions of the Teuton\r\nare manifest in the gradual improvement and steadiness of their\r\npolitical arrangements. “The prevalent political sentiment of Great\r\nBritain is undoubtedly _conservative_, in the best sense of the word,\r\nwith a powerful under-current of _democratic tendencies_. This gives\r\ngreat power and strength to the political and social body of this\r\ncountry, and makes revolutions by physical force almost impossible. It\r\ncan be said, without assumption or pretension, that the body politic of\r\nBritain is in a sounder state of health than any other in Europe; and\r\nthat those know very little of this country, who, led away by what they\r\nsee in France, always dream of violent and revolutionary changes in the\r\nconstitution. Great Britain is the only country in Europe which has had\r\nthe good fortune to have all her institutions worked out and framed by\r\nher in a strictly _organic_ manner—that is, in accordance with _organic\r\nwants_, which require different _conditions_ at different and\r\n_successive_ stages of national development—and not by _theoretical\r\nexperiments_, as in many other countries which are still in a state of\r\nexcitement consequent upon these experiments. The social character of\r\nthe people of this country, besides the features which they have in\r\ncommon with other nations of Teutonic origin, is, on the whole,\r\ndomestic, reserved, aristocratic, and exclusive.”[194]\r\n\r\nIn speculating upon the effects of external circumstances, and on the\r\noriginal dispositions of the different races of mankind, the stationary\r\nand unchanged condition is a curious phenomenon in the history of\r\nnations. The inhabitants of Hindostan have not advanced within the\r\nhistorical period; neither have the Chinese. The Peruvians and Mexicans\r\nhad arrived at a considerable degree of civilization, at which they\r\nbecame stationary, never having availed themselves of their fine country\r\nand noble rivers; and their conquerors, the Spaniards, degenerated into\r\nthe same apathy with the conquered. The unaccountable gipsies have for\r\nages maintained their peculiarities in all countries; so have the Jews\r\nand Armenians, who by the perseverance with which they have adhered to\r\ntheir language and institutions, have resisted the influence of physical\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\nThe influence of external circumstances on man is not greater than his\r\ninfluence on the material world. He cannot create power, it is true, but\r\nhe dexterously avails himself of the powers of nature to subdue nature.\r\nAir, fire, water, steam, gravitation, his own muscular strength, and\r\nthat of animals rendered obedient to his will, are the instruments by\r\nwhich he has converted the desert into a garden, drained marshes, cut\r\ncanals, made roads, turns the course of rivers, cleared away forests in\r\none country, and planted them in another. By these operations he has\r\naltered the climate, changed the course of local winds, increased or\r\ndiminished the quantity of rain, and softened the rigour of the seasons.\r\nIn the time of Strabo, the cold in France was so intense, that it was\r\nthought impossible to ripen grapes north of the Cevennes: the Rhine and\r\nthe Danube were every winter covered with ice thick enough to bear any\r\nweight. Man’s influence on vegetation has been immense, but the most\r\nimportant changes had been effected in the antediluvian ages of the\r\nworld. Cain was a tiller of the ground. The olive, the vine, and the\r\nfig-tree have been cultivated time immemorial: wheat, rice, and barley,\r\nhave been so long in an artificial state, that their origin is unknown;\r\neven maize, which is a Mexican plant, was in use among the American\r\ntribes before the Spanish conquest; and tobacco was already used by them\r\nto allay the pangs of hunger, to which those who depend upon the chace\r\nfor food must be exposed. Most of the ordinary culinary vegetables have\r\nbeen known for ages, and it is remarkable that in these days, when our\r\ngardens are adorned with innumerable native plants in a cultivated\r\nstate, few new grains, vegetables, or fruits have been reclaimed; the\r\nold have been produced in infinite variety, and many brought from\r\nforeign countries: yet there must exist many plants capable of\r\ncultivation, as unpromising in their wild state as the turnip or carrot.\r\n\r\nSome families of plants are more susceptible of improvement than others,\r\nand, like man himself, can bear almost any climate. One kind of wheat\r\ngrows to 62° N. latitude; rye and barley are hardier, and succeed still\r\nfarther north; and few countries are absolutely without grass. The\r\ncruciform tribe abounds in useful plants, indeed that family, together\r\nwith the solanum, the papilionaceous and umbelliferous tribes, furnish\r\nmost of our vegetables. Many plants, like animals, are of one colour\r\nonly in their wild state, and their blossoms are single. Art has\r\nintroduced the variety we now see in the same species, and, by changing\r\nthe anthers of the wild flowers into petals, has produced double\r\nblossoms: by art, too, many plants, natives of warm countries, have been\r\nnaturalized in colder climates. Few useful plants have beautiful\r\nblossoms—but if utility were the only object, of what pleasure should we\r\nbe deprived! Refinement is not wanting in the inmates of a cottage\r\ncovered with roses and honeysuckle; and the little garden cultivated\r\namidst a life of toil, tells of a peaceful home.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects which tend to the improvement of our race, the\r\nflower-garden and the park adorned with native and foreign trees have no\r\nsmall share: they are the greatest ornaments of the British Islands; and\r\nthe love of a country life, which is so strong a passion, is chiefly\r\nowing to the law of primogeniture, by which the head of a family is\r\nsecured in the possession and transmission of his undivided estate, and\r\ntherefore each generation takes pride and pleasure in adorning the home\r\nof its forefathers.\r\n\r\nAnimals yield more readily to man’s influence than vegetables, and\r\ncertain classes have greater flexibility of disposition and structure\r\nthan others. Those only are capable of being perfectly reclaimed that\r\nhave a natural tendency for it, without which man’s endeavours would be\r\nunavailing. This predisposition is greatest in animals which are\r\ngregarious and follow a leader, as elephants, dogs, horses, and cattle\r\ndo in their wild state; yet even among these some species are\r\nrefractory, as the buffalo, which can only be regarded as\r\nhalf-reclaimed. The canine tribe, on the contrary, are capable of the\r\ngreatest attachment, not the dog only, man’s faithful companion, but\r\neven the wolf, and especially the hyæna, generally believed to be so\r\nferocious. After an absence of many months, a hyæna which had been the\r\nfellow-passenger of a friend of the author’s in a voyage from India,\r\nrecognized his voice before he came in sight, and on seeing him it\r\nshowed the greatest joy, lay down like a dog and licked his hands. He\r\nhad been kind to it on the voyage, and no animal forgets kindness, which\r\nis the surest way of reclaiming them. There cannot be a greater mistake\r\nthan the harsh and cruel means by which dogs and horses are too commonly\r\ntrained; but it is long before man learns that his power is mental, and\r\nthat it is his intellect alone that has given him dominion over the\r\nearth and its inhabitants, of which so many far surpass him in physical\r\nstrength. The useful animals were reclaimed by the early inhabitants of\r\nAsia, and it is very remarkable, notwithstanding the enterprise and\r\nactivity of the present times, that among the multitudes of animals that\r\ninhabit America, Central and Southern Africa, Australia and the Indian\r\nArchipelago, 4 only have been domesticated, yet many may be capable of\r\nbecoming useful to man. Of 35 species, of which we possess one or more\r\ndomestic races, 31 are natives of Asia, Europe, and North Africa; these\r\ncountries are far from being exhausted, and a complete hemisphere is yet\r\nunexplored. An attempt has been made to domesticate the Llama, the\r\nDziggetai, Zebra, and some species of Indian deer, but the success is\r\neither doubtful or the attempt has not been followed up. Little has been\r\nleft for modern nations but the improvement of the species, and in that\r\nthey have been very successful. The variety of horses, dogs, cattle, and\r\nsheep is beyond number. The form, colour, and even the disposition, may\r\nbe materially altered, and the habits engrafted are transmitted to the\r\noffspring, as instinctive properties independent of education. Domestic\r\nfowls go in flocks on their native meads when wild. There are, however,\r\ninstances of solitary birds being tamed to an extraordinary degree, as\r\nthe raven, one of the most sagacious.\r\n\r\nMan’s necessities and pleasure have been the cause of great changes in\r\nthe animal creation—and his destructive propensity of still greater.\r\nAnimals are intended for our use, and field-sports are advantageous by\r\nencouraging a daring and active spirit in young men, but the utter\r\ndestruction of some races, in order to protect those destined for his\r\npleasure, is too selfish. Animals soon acquire a dread of man, which\r\nbecomes instinctive and hereditary; in newly-discovered uninhabited\r\ncountries, birds and beasts are so tame as to allow themselves to be\r\ncaught; whales scarcely got out of the way of the ships that first\r\nnavigated the Arctic Ocean, but now they universally have a dread of the\r\ncommon enemy: whales and seals have been extirpated in various places;\r\nsea-fowl and birds of passage are not likely to be extinguished, but\r\nmany land animals and birds are vanishing before the advance of\r\ncivilization. Drainage, cultivation, cutting down of forests, and even\r\nthe introduction of new plants and animals, destroy some of the old, and\r\nalter the relations between those that remain. The inaccessible cliffs\r\nof the Himalaya and Andes will afford a refuge to the eagle and condor,\r\nbut the time will come when the mighty forests of the Amazons and\r\nOrinoco will disappear with the myriads of their joyous inhabitants. The\r\nlion, the tiger, and the elephant will be known only by ancient records.\r\nMan, the lord of the creation, will extirpate the noble creatures of the\r\nearth—but he himself will ever be the slave of the canker-worm and the\r\nfly. Cultivation may lessen the scourge of the insect tribe, but God’s\r\ngreat army will ever, from time to time, appear suddenly—no one knows\r\nfrom whence; the grub will take possession of the ground, and the locust\r\nwill come from the desert and destroy the fairest prospects of the\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\nThough the unreclaimed portion of the animal creation is falling before\r\nthe progress of improvement, yet man has been both the voluntary and the\r\ninvoluntary cause of the introduction of new animals and plants into\r\ncountries in which they were not natives. The Spanish conquerors little\r\nthought that the descendants of the few cattle and horses they allowed\r\nto run wild, would resume the original character of their species, and\r\nroam in hundreds of thousands over the savannahs of South America.\r\nWherever man is, civilized or savage, there also is the dog, but he too\r\nhas in some places resumed his native state and habits, and hunts in\r\npacks. Domestic animals, grain, fruit, vegetables, and the weeds that\r\ngrow with them, have been conveyed by colonists to all settlements.\r\nBirds and insects follow certain plants into countries in which they\r\nwere never seen before. Even the inhabitants of the waters change their\r\nabode in consequence of the influence of man. Fish, natives of the\r\nrivers on the coast of the Mexican Gulf, have migrated by the canals to\r\nthe heart of North America; and the mytilus polymorphus, a shell-fish\r\nbrought to the London Docks in the timbers of ships from the brackish\r\nwaters of the Black Sea and its tributary streams, has spread into the\r\ninterior of England by the Croydon and other canals.\r\n\r\nThe influence of man on man is a power of the highest order, far\r\nsurpassing that which he possesses over inanimate or animal nature. It\r\nis, however, as a collective body, and not as an individual, that he\r\nexercises this influence over his fellow-creatures. The free-will of\r\nman, nay, even his most capricious passions, neutralize each other, when\r\nlarge numbers of men are considered. Professor Quetelet has most ably\r\nproved, that the greater the number of individuals, the more completely\r\ndoes the will of each, as well as all individual peculiarities, moral or\r\nphysical, disappear, and allow the series of general facts to\r\npredominate, which depend upon the causes by which society exists and is\r\npreserved. The uniformity with which the number of marriages in Belgium\r\noccurred in 20 years, places the neutralization of the free-will of the\r\nindividual man beyond a doubt, and is one of many instances of the\r\nimportance of average quantities in arriving at general laws.\r\n\r\nCertainly no event in a man’s life depends more upon his free will than\r\nhis marriage, yet it appears from the records in Brussels, that nearly\r\nthe same number of marriages take place every year, in the towns as well\r\nas in the country, and, moreover, that the same constancy prevails in\r\neach province, though the numbers of the people are so small, that\r\naccidental causes might be more likely to affect the general result than\r\nwhen the numbers are larger. In fact the whole affair passes as if the\r\ninhabitants of Belgium had agreed to contract nearly the same number of\r\nmarriages annually, at each stage of life. Young people may possibly be\r\nin some degree under the control of parents, but there can be no\r\nrestraint on the free will of men of 30 and women of 60 years of age,\r\nyet the same number of such incongruous marriages do annually take place\r\nbetween men and women at those unsuitable ages—a fact which almost\r\nexceeds belief. The day fixed for a wedding is of all things most\r\nentirely dependent on the will of the parties, yet even here there is\r\nregularity in the annual recurrence. (See Table on next page.)\r\n\r\nWith regard to crimes also, M. Quetelet observes that the same number of\r\ncrimes of the same description are committed annually, with remarkable\r\nuniformity, even in the case of those crimes which would seem most\r\nlikely to baffle all attempt at prediction. The same regularity occurs\r\nin the sentences passed on criminals: in France, in every hundred trials\r\nthere were sixty-one convictions regularly, year after year.\r\n\r\nForgetfulness, as well as free-will, is under constant laws: the number\r\nof undirected letters put into the post-office in London and in Paris is\r\nvery nearly the same year after year respectively—in London they amount\r\nto 2000: so that even the deviations from free-will proves the\r\ngenerality and the constancy of the laws that govern us.\r\n\r\nScientific discoveries and social combinations, which put in practice\r\ngreat social principles, are not without a decided influence; but these\r\ncauses of action coming from man, are placed out of the sphere of the\r\nfree-will of each: so that individual impulse has less to do with the\r\nprogress of mankind than is generally believed. When society has arrived\r\nat a certain point of advancement, certain discoveries will naturally be\r\nmade; the general mind is directed that way, and if one individual does\r\nnot hit upon the discovery, another will. Therefore, on the disputes and\r\ndiscussions of different nations for the honour of particular inventions\r\nor discoveries, as for example the steam-engine, a narrow view of the\r\nsubject is taken; they properly belong to the age in which they are\r\nmade, without derogating from the merits of those benefactors of mankind\r\nwho have lessened his toil or increased his comfort by the efforts of\r\ntheir genius. The time had come for the invention of printing, and\r\nprinting was invented; and the same observation is applicable to many\r\nobjects in the physical, as well as to the moral world. In the present\r\ndisturbed state of society the time is come for the termination of the\r\nfeudal system, which will be swept away by the force of public opinion,\r\nthough individuality merges in these general movements.\r\n\r\n _The following Table, which is one of the most curious of statistical\r\n            documents, was formed by Professor Quetelet from\r\n                the Register of Marriages at Brussels_:—\r\n\r\n +------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |                       MARRIAGES IN BELGIUM IN THE YEARS                                  |\r\n +---------------------+-----------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n |                     |                       |  1841  |  1842  |  1843  |  1844  |  1845  |\r\n +---------------------+-----------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n |                    {| Women of 30 years of  |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n |                    {| age and under         | 12,788 | 12,422 | 12,368 | 13,024 | 13,157 |\r\n | Men of 30 years of {| Women from 30 to 45   |  2,630 |  2,626 |  2,406 |  2,375 |  2,438 |\r\n |  age and under, to {| Women from 45 to 60   |     93 |    121 |    125 |    129 |    102 |\r\n |                    {| Women from 60 upwards |      7 |      6 |      8 |      5 |      8 |\r\n |                     |                       |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n |                    {| Women of 30 and under |  6,122 |  5,803 |  5,617 |  4,948 |  5,810 |\r\n | Men from 30 to 35  {| Women from 30 to 45   |  5,531 |  5,396 |  5,100 |  5,205 |  4,981 |\r\n |  inclusive, to     {| Women from 45 to 60   |    529 |    542 |    479 |    493 |    532 |\r\n |                    {| Women from 60 upwards |     18 |     12 |     18 |     21 |     21 |\r\n |                     |                       |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n |                    {| Women of 30 and under |    376 |    346 |    380 |    355 |    346 |\r\n | Men from 45 to 60  {| Women from 30 to 45   |    896 |    879 |    896 |    951 |    993 |\r\n |  inclusive, to     {| Women from 45 to 60   |    461 |    447 |    433 |    462 |    460 |\r\n |                    {| Women from 60 upwards |     23 |     19 |     29 |     36 |     28 |\r\n |                     |                       |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n |                    {| Women of 30 and under |     48 |     35 |     45 |     41 |     36 |\r\n | Men from 60 and    {| Women from 30 to 45   |    139 |    147 |    133 |    119 |    125 |\r\n |   above, to        {| Women from 45 to 60   |    153 |    170 |    137 |    112 |    145 |\r\n |                    {| Women from 60 upwards |     62 |     52 |     48 |     50 |     31 |\r\n |                     |                       +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n |            Annual Number of Marriages       | 29,876 | 29,023 | 28,220 | 29,326 | 29,210 |\r\n +---------------------+-----------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\nThough each individual is accountable to God for his conduct, it is\r\nevident that the great laws which regulate mankind are altogether\r\nindependent of his will, and that liberty of action is perfectly\r\ncompatible with the general design of Providence. “A more profound study\r\nof the social system will have the effect of limiting more and more the\r\nsphere in which man’s free-will is exercised, for the Supreme Being\r\ncould not grant him a power which tends to overthrow the laws impressed\r\non all the parts of creation: He has traced its limits, as He has fixed\r\nthose of the ocean.”\r\n\r\nMan is eminently sociable; he willingly gives up part of his free-will\r\nto become a member of a social body; and it is this portion of the\r\nindividuality of each member of that body, taken in the aggregate, which\r\nbecomes the directrice of the principal social movements of a nation. It\r\nmay be greater or less, good or bad, but it determines the customs,\r\nwants, and the national spirit of a people; it regulates the sum of\r\ntheir moral statistics; and it is in that manner that the cultivation or\r\nsavageness, the virtues or the vices, of individuals have their\r\ninfluence. It is thus that private morality becomes the base of public\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\nThe more man advances in civilization the greater will be his collective\r\ninfluence, for knowledge is power; and at no time did the mental\r\nsuperiority of the cultivated races produce such changes as they do at\r\npresent, because they have extended their influence to the uttermost\r\nparts of the earth by emigration, colonization, and commerce. In\r\ncivilized society the number of people in the course of time exceeds the\r\nmeans of sustenance, which compels some to emigrate; others are induced\r\nby a spirit of enterprise to go to new countries, some for the love of\r\ngain, others to fly from oppression.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the New World opened a wide field for emigration. Spain\r\nand Portugal, the first to avail themselves of it, acquired dominion\r\nover some of the finest parts of South America, which they have\r\nmaintained till lately a change of times has rendered their colonies\r\nindependent states. Liberal opinions have spread into the interior of\r\nthat continent, in proportion to the facility of communication with the\r\ncities on the coasts, from whence European ideas are disseminated. Of\r\nthis Venezuela and Chile are instances, where civilization and\r\nprosperity have advanced more rapidly than in the interior parts of\r\nSouth America, where the Andes are higher and the distance from the sea\r\ngreater. Civilization has been impeded in many of the smaller states by\r\nwar, and those broils inevitable among people unaccustomed to free\r\ninstitutions. Brazil would have been further advanced but for slavery,\r\nthat stain on the human race, which corrupts the master as much as it\r\ndebases the slave.\r\n\r\nSome of the native South American tribes have spontaneously made\r\nconsiderably progress in civilization in modern times; others have\r\nbenefited by the Spanish and Portuguese colonists; and many have been\r\nbrought into subjection by the Jesuits, who have instructed them in some\r\nof the arts of social life. But these Indians are not more religious\r\nthan their neighbours, and, from the restraint to which they have been\r\nsubject, have lost vigour of character without improving in intellect;\r\nso that now they are either stationary or retrograde. Extensive regions\r\nare still the abode of men in the lowest state of barbarism: some of the\r\ntribes inhabiting the silvas of the Orinoco, Amazons, and Uruguay are\r\ncannibals.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the colonists in North America sealed the fate of the red\r\nmen. The inhabitants of the Union, too late awakened to the just claims\r\nof the ancient proprietors of the land, have recently, but vainly,\r\nattempted to save the remnant. The white man, like an irresistible\r\ntorrent, has already reached the centre of the continent; and the native\r\ntribes now retreat towards the far west, and will continue to retreat,\r\ntill the Pacific Ocean arrests them, and the animals on their\r\nhunting-grounds are exterminated. The almost universal dislike the\r\nIndian has shown for the arts of peace has been one of the principal\r\ncauses of his decline, although the Cherokee tribe, which has lately\r\nmigrated to the west of the Mississippi, is a remarkable exception; the\r\ngreater number of them are industrious planters or mechanics; they have\r\na republican government, and publish a newspaper in their own language,\r\nin a character lately invented by one of that nation.\r\n\r\nNo part of the world has been the scene of greater iniquity than the\r\nWest Indian islands—and that perpetrated by the most enlightened nations\r\nof Europe. The native race has long been swept away by the stranger, and\r\na new people, cruelly torn from their homes, have been made the slaves\r\nof hard task-masters. If the odious participation in this guilt has been\r\na stain on the British name, the abolition of slavery by the universal\r\nacclamation of the nation will ever form one of the brightest pages in\r\ntheir history, so full of glory: nor will it be the less so, that\r\njustice was combined with mercy, by the millions of money granted to\r\nindemnify the proprietors. It is deeply to be lamented that our brethren\r\non the other side of the Atlantic have not followed the example of their\r\nfatherland; but in limited monarchies the voice of the people is\r\nlistened to, while republican governments are more apt to become its\r\nslave. The Northern States have nobly declared every man free who sets\r\nhis foot on their territory—and the time will come when the Southern\r\nStates will sacrifice interest to justice and mercy.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the design of Providence to supplant the savage by\r\ncivilized man in the continent of Australia as well as in North America,\r\nthough every effort has been made to prevent the extinction of the\r\nnatives. Most of the tribes in that continent are as low in the scale of\r\nmankind as the cannibal Fuegians, whom Captain Fitzroy so generously,\r\nbut so ineffectually, attempted to reclaim. Some of the New Hollanders\r\nare faithful servants for a time, but they almost always find the\r\nrestraint of civilized life irksome, and return to their former habits,\r\nthough truly miserable in a country where the means of existence are so\r\nscanty. Animals and birds are very scarce, and there is no fruit or\r\nvegetable for the sustenance of man.\r\n\r\nSlavery has been a greater impediment to the improvement of Africa than\r\neven the physical disadvantages of the country—the great arid deserts\r\nand unwholesome coasts. A spontaneous civilization has arisen in various\r\nparts of Southern and Central Africa, in which there has been\r\nconsiderable progress in agriculture and commerce; but civilized man has\r\nbeen a scourge on the Atlantic coast, which has extended its baneful\r\ninfluence into the heart of the continent, by the encouragement it has\r\ngiven to warfare among the natives for the capture of slaves, and for\r\nthe introduction of European vices, unredeemed by Christian virtues. Now\r\nthat France and England have united in the suppression of this odious\r\ntraffic, some hopes may be entertained that their colonies may be\r\nbeneficial to the natives, and that other nations may follow their\r\nexample, in which, however, they have been anticipated by three\r\nMahommedan sovereigns; the Sultan has abolished the slave market in\r\nConstantinople, Ibrahim Pasha on his return from France and England gave\r\nfreedom to his bondsmen in Egypt, and the Bey of Tunis has abolished\r\nslavery in his dominions.\r\n\r\nThe French are zealous in improving the people in Algiers, but the\r\nconstant warfare in which they have been embroiled ever since their\r\nconquest must render their success in civilizing the natives at least\r\nremote. The inhabitants of those extensive and magnificent countries in\r\nthe eastern seas that have long been colonized by the Dutch have made\r\nbut little progress under their rule.\r\n\r\nThe British colony at the Cape of Good Hope has had considerable\r\ninfluence on the neighbouring rude nations, who now begin to adopt more\r\ncivilized habits. When Mr. Somerville visited Litako, the natives for\r\nthe first time saw a white person and a horse, and were scantily clothed\r\nwith skins. When Dr. Smith visited them 20 years afterwards, he found\r\nthe chief men mounted on horseback, wearing hats made of rushes, and an\r\nattempt made to imitate European dress.\r\n\r\nColonization has nowhere produced such happy results as among the\r\namiable and cultivated inhabitants of India, who are sensible of the\r\nbenefits they derive from the impartial administration of just and equal\r\nlaws, the foundation of schools and colleges, and the wide extension of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nAll the causes of emigration have operated by turns on the inhabitants\r\nof Britain, and various circumstances have concurred to make their\r\ncolonies permanent. In North America, that which not many years ago was\r\na British colony has become a great independent nation, occupying a\r\nlarge portion of the continent. The Australian continent and New Zealand\r\nwill in after ages be peopled by a British race, and will become centres\r\nof civilization which will spread its influence to the uttermost islands\r\nof the Pacific. These splendid islands, possessing every advantage of\r\nclimate and soil, with a population in many parts far advanced in the\r\narts of civilized life, industry, and commerce, though in others savage,\r\nwill in time come in for a share of the general improvement. The success\r\nthat has attended the noble and unaided efforts of Sir J. Brooke in\r\nBorneo, shows how much the influence of an active and benevolent mind\r\ncan in a short time effect.\r\n\r\nThe colonies on the continent of India are already centres from which\r\nthe culture of Europe is spreading over the East.\r\n\r\nCommerce has not less influence on mankind than colonization, with which\r\nit is intimately connected; and the narrow limits of the British Islands\r\nhave rendered it necessary for its inhabitants to exert their industry.\r\nThe riches of our mines in coal and metals, which produce a yearly\r\nincome of 24,000,000_l._ sterling, is a principal cause of our\r\nmanufacturing and commercial wealth; but even with these natural\r\nadvantages, more is due not only to our talents and enterprise, but to\r\nour high character for faith and honour.\r\n\r\nEvery country has its own peculiar productions, and by an unrestrained\r\ninterchange of the gifts of Providence the condition of all is improved.\r\nThe exclusive jealousy with which commerce has hitherto been fettered,\r\nshows the length of time that is necessary to wear out the effects of\r\nthose selfish passions which separated nations when they were yet\r\nbarbarous. It required a high degree of cultivation to break down those\r\nbarriers consecrated by their antiquity; and the accomplishment of this\r\nimportant change evinces the rate at which the present age is advancing.\r\n\r\nA new era in the history of the world began when China was opened to\r\nEuropean intercourse; but many years must pass before European influence\r\ncan penetrate that vast empire, and eradicate those illiberal prejudices\r\nby which it has so long been governed.\r\n\r\nTwo important triumphs yet remain to be achieved over physical\r\ndifficulties by the science and energy of man, namely, the junction of\r\nthe Pacific and Atlantic Oceans at the Isthmus of Central America, and\r\nthe union of the Red Sea with the Mediterranean at that of Suez. The\r\nfirst seems to be on the eve of accomplishment, and, in conjunction with\r\nthe treasures with which the auriferous district of California is said\r\nto abound, may bring about a complete revolution in the tide of affairs;\r\nand that country, hitherto so completely separated from the rest of the\r\nworld and so little known, will become a new centre of civilization,\r\nwhose influence will be diffused over the wide Pacific to the shores of\r\nthe eastern continent; the expectation of Columbus will then be\r\nrealized—of a passage to the East Indies by the Atlantic. Should the\r\nMediterranean and Red Sea be united by a water communication,\r\nAlexandria, Venice, and the other maritime cities of southern Europe may\r\nregain, at least in part, the mercantile position which they lost by the\r\ndiscovery of Vasco da Gama.[195]\r\n\r\nThe advantages of colonization and commerce to the less civilized part\r\nof the world are incalculable, as well as to those at home, not only by\r\nfurnishing an exchange for manufactures, important as this is, but by\r\nthe immense accession of knowledge of the earth and its inhabitants,\r\nthat has been thus attained.\r\n\r\nThe history of former ages exhibits nothing to be compared with the\r\nmental activity of the present. Steam, which annihilates time and space,\r\nfills mankind with schemes for advantage or defence: but however\r\nmercenary the motives for enterprise may be, it is instrumental in\r\nbringing nations together. The facility of communication is rapidly\r\nassimilating national character. Society in most of the capitals is\r\nformed on the same model; and as the study of modern languages is now\r\nconsidered a part of polite education, and every well-educated person\r\nspeaks more than one modern tongue, one of the great barriers to the\r\nassimilation of character amongst nations will be removed.\r\n\r\nScience has never been so extensively and so successfully cultivated as\r\nat the present time: the collective wisdom and experience of Europe and\r\nthe United States of America is now brought to bear on subjects of the\r\nhighest importance in annual meetings, where the common pursuit of truth\r\nis as beneficial to the moral as to the intellectual character, and the\r\nnoble objects of investigation are no longer confined to a philosophic\r\nfew, but are becoming widely diffused among all ranks of society, and\r\nthe most enlightened governments have given their support to measures\r\nthat could not have been otherwise accomplished.[196] Simultaneous\r\nobservations are made at numerous places in both hemispheres on\r\nelectricity, magnetism, on the tides and currents of the air and the\r\nocean, and those mysterious vicissitudes of temperature and moisture,\r\nwhich bless the labours of the husbandman one year, and blight them in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe places of the nebulæ and fixed stars, and their motions, are known\r\nwith unexampled precision, and the most refined analyses embrace the\r\nmost varied objects. Three new satellites and six new planets have been\r\ndiscovered within four years, and one of these under circumstances the\r\nmost unprecedented. In the far heavens, from disturbances in the motions\r\nof Uranus which could not be accounted for, an unknown and unseen body\r\nwas declared to be revolving on the utmost verge of the solar system;\r\nand it was found in the very region of the heavens pointed out by\r\nanalysis. On earth, though hundreds of miles apart, that invisible\r\nmessenger, electricity, instantaneously conveys the thoughts of the\r\ninvisible spirit of man to man—results of science sublimely\r\ntranscendental.\r\n\r\nVain would be the attempt to enumerate the improvements in machinery and\r\nmechanics, the canals and railroads that have been made, the harbours\r\nthat have been improved, the land that has been drained, the bridges\r\nthat have been constructed; and now, although Britain is inferior to\r\nnone in many things, and superior to all in some, one of our most\r\ndistinguished engineers declares that we are scarcely beyond the\r\nthreshold in improvement; to stand still is to retrograde, human\r\ningenuity will always keep pace with the unforeseen, the increasing\r\nwants of the age.[197] “Who knows what may yet be in store for our use;\r\nwhat new discovery may again change the tide of human affairs; what\r\nhidden treasures may yet be brought to light in the air or in the ocean,\r\nof which we know so little; or what virtues there may be in the herbs of\r\nthe field, and in the treasures of the earth—how far its hidden fires,\r\nor stores of ice, may yet become available—ages can never exhaust the\r\ntreasures of nature or the talent of man.”[198] It would be difficult to\r\nfollow the rapid course of discovery through the complicated mazes of\r\nmagnetism and electricity; the action of the electric current on the\r\npolarized sun-beam, one of the most beautiful of modern discoveries,\r\nleading to relations hitherto unsuspected between that power and the\r\ncomplex assemblage of visible and invisible influences on solar light,\r\nby one of which nature has recently been made to paint her own likeness.\r\nIt is impossible to convey an idea of the rapid succession of the varied\r\nand curious results of chemistry, and its application to physiology and\r\nagriculture; moreover, distinguished works have lately been published at\r\nhome and abroad on the science of mind, which has been so successfully\r\ncultivated in our own country. Geography has assumed a new character, by\r\nthat unwearied search for accurate knowledge and truth that marks the\r\npresent age, and physical geography is altogether a new science.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of nautical and geographical discovery, begun in the 15th\r\ncentury, by those illustrious navigators who had a new world to\r\ndiscover, is at this day as energetic as ever, though the results are\r\nless brilliant. Neither the long gloomy night of a polar winter, nor the\r\ndangers of the ice and the storm, deter our gallant seamen from seeking\r\na better acquaintance with “this ball of earth,” even under its most\r\nfrowning aspect; and that, for honour, which they are as eager to seek\r\neven in the cannon’s mouth. Nor have other nations of Europe and America\r\nbeen without their share in these bold adventures. The scorching sun and\r\ndeadly swamps of the tropics as little prevent the traveller from\r\ncollecting the animals and plants of the present creation, or the\r\ngeologist from investigating those of ages long gone by. Man daily\r\nindicates his birthright as lord of the creation, and compels every land\r\nand sea to contribute to his knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished modern travellers, following the noble example of\r\nBaron Humboldt, the patriarch of physical geography, take a more\r\nextended view of the subject than the earth and its animal and vegetable\r\ninhabitants afford, and include in their researches the past and present\r\ncondition of man, the origin, manners, and languages of existing\r\nnations, and the monuments of those that have been. Geography has had\r\nits dark ages, during which the situation of many great cities and spots\r\nof celebrity in sacred and profane history had been entirely lost sight\r\nof, which are now discovered by the learning and assiduity of the modern\r\ntraveller. Of this, Italy, Egypt, the Holy Land, Asia Minor, Arabia, and\r\nthe valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris, with the adjacent mountains of\r\nPersia, are remarkable instances, not to mention the vast region of the\r\nEast, and the remote centres of aboriginal civilization in the New\r\nWorld. The interesting discoveries of Mr. Layard, who possessed every\r\nacquirement that could render a traveller competent to accomplish so\r\narduous an undertaking, have brought to light the long-hidden treasures\r\nof the ancient Nineveh, where its own peculiar style of art had existed\r\nanterior to that of Egypt.[199] In many parts of the world the ruins of\r\ncities of extraordinary magnitude and architecture show that there are\r\nwide regions of whose original inhabitants we know nothing. The Andes of\r\nPeru and Mexico have remains of civilized nations before the age of the\r\nIncas. Mr. Pentland has found numerous remains of Peruvian monuments in\r\nevery part of the great valley of the Peru-Bolivian Andes, and many\r\nparts of the imperial capital Cusco, little changed from what they were\r\nat the downfall of Atahualpa. Mr. Stephens has found in the woods of\r\nCentral America the ruins of great cities, adorned with sculpture and\r\npictorial writings, vestiges of a people far advanced, who had once\r\ncultivated the soil where these entangled forests now grow.\r\nPicture-writings have been discovered by Sir Robert Schomburgk on rocks\r\nin Guiana, spread over an extent of 350,000 square miles, similar to\r\nthose found in the United States and in Siberia. Magnificent buildings\r\nstill exist in good preservation all over eastern Asia, and many in a\r\nruinous state belong to a period far beyond written record.\r\n\r\nAncient literature has furnished a subject of still more interesting\r\nresearch, from which it is evident that the mind of man is essentially\r\nthe same under very different circumstances: every nation far advanced\r\nin civilization has had its age of poetry, the drama, romance, and\r\nphilosophy, each stamped with the character of the people and times, and\r\nstill more with their religious belief. Our profound Oriental scholars\r\nhave made known to Europeans the refined Sanscrit literature of\r\nHindostan, its schools of philosophy and astronomy, its dramatic\r\nwritings and poetry, which are original and beautiful, and to these the\r\nlearned in Greece and Italy have contributed.\r\n\r\nThe riches of Chinese literature, and their valuable geography, were\r\nintroduced into Europe by the French Jesuits of the last century, and\r\nfollowed up with success by the French and English philosophers of the\r\npresent: to France we also owe much of our knowledge of the poetry and\r\nletters of Persia; and from the time that Dr. Young deciphered the\r\ninscriptions on the Rosetta Stone, Egyptian hieroglyphics and\r\npicture-writing have been studied by the learned of France, England, and\r\nItaly, and we have reason to expect much new information from the more\r\nrecent researches of Professor Lepsius of Berlin. The Germans, indeed,\r\nhave left few subjects of ancient literature unexplored, even to the\r\nlanguage written at Babylon and Nineveh—the most successful attempt to\r\ndecipher which is due to a distinguished countryman of our own, Colonel\r\nRawlinson.\r\n\r\nThe press has overflowed with an unprecedented quantity of literature,\r\nsome of standard merit, and much more that is ephemeral, suited to all\r\nranks, on every subject, with the aim, in our own country at least, to\r\nimprove the people, and to advocate the cause of morality and virtue.\r\nAll this mental energy is but an effect of those laws which regulate\r\nhuman affairs, and include in their generality the various changes that\r\ntend to improve the condition of man.\r\n\r\nThe fine arts do not keep pace with science, though they have not been\r\naltogether left behind. Painting, like poetry, must come spontaneously,\r\nbecause a feeling for it depends upon innate sympathies in the human\r\nbreast. Nothing external could affect us, unless there were\r\ncorresponding ideas within; poetically constituted minds of the highest\r\norganization are most deeply impressed with whatever is excellent. All\r\nare not gifted with a strong perception of the beautiful, in the same\r\nway as some persons cannot see certain colours, or hear certain sounds.\r\nThose elevated sentiments which constitute genius are given to few; yet\r\nsomething akin, though inferior in degree, exists in most men.\r\nConsequently, though culture may not inspire genius, it cherishes and\r\ncalls forth the natural perception of what is good and beautiful, and by\r\nthat means improves the tone of the national mind, and forms a\r\ncounterpoise to the all-absorbing useful and commercial.\r\n\r\nHistorical painting is successfully cultivated both in France and\r\nGermany. The Germans have modelled their school on the true style of the\r\nancient masters. They have become their rivals in richness and beauty of\r\ncolouring, and are not surpassed in vividness of imagination, nor in\r\nvariety and sublimity of composition, which is poetry of the highest\r\norder embodied. Sculpture and architecture are also marked by that\r\nelevated and pure taste which distinguish their other works of art.[200]\r\nFrench artists, following in the same steps, have produced historical\r\nworks of great merit. Pictures of _genre_ and scenes of domestic life\r\nhave been painted with much expression and beauty by our own artists;\r\nand British landscapes, like some painted by German artists, are not\r\nmere portraits of nature, but pictures of high poetical feeling, and the\r\nexcellence of their composition has been acknowledged all over Europe,\r\nby the popularity of the engravings which illustrate many of our modern\r\nbooks. The encouragement given to this branch of art at home may be\r\nascribed to the taste for a country life so general in England.\r\nWater-colour painting, which is entirely of British growth, has now\r\nbecome a favourite style in every country, and is brought to the highest\r\nperfection in our own.\r\n\r\nThe Italians have had the merit of restoring sculpture to the pure style\r\nwhich it had lost, and that gifted people have produced some of the\r\nnoblest specimens of modern art. The greatest genius of his time left\r\nthe snows of the far North to spend his days in Rome, the head-quarters\r\nof art; and our own sculptors of eminent talents have established\r\nthemselves in Rome, where they find a more congenial spirit than in\r\ntheir own country, in which the compositions of Flaxman were not\r\nappreciated till they had become the admiration of Europe. Munich can\r\nboast of some of the finest specimens of modern sculpture and\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nThe Opera, one of the most refined of theatrical amusements in every\r\ncapital city in Europe, displays the excellence and power of Italian\r\nmelody, which has been transmitted from age to age by a succession of\r\ngreat composers. German music, partaking of the learned character of the\r\nnation, is rich in original harmony, which requires a cultivated taste\r\nto understand and appreciate.\r\n\r\nItaly is the only country that has had two poetical eras of the highest\r\norder; and, great as the Latin period was, that of Dante was more\r\noriginal and sublime. The Germans, so eminent in every branch of\r\nliterature, have also been great as poets; the power of Goethe’s genius\r\nwill render his poems as permanent as the language in which they are\r\nwritten. France is, as it long has been, the abode of the Comic Muse;\r\nand although that nation can claim great poets of a more serious cast,\r\nyet the language and the habits of the people are more suited to the gay\r\nthan the grave style. Though the British may have been inferior to other\r\nnations in some branches of the fine arts, yet poetry, immeasurably the\r\ngreatest and most noble, redeems, and more than redeems us. The nation\r\nthat produced the poetry of Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare and Milton,\r\nwith all the brilliant train, down nearly to the present time, must ever\r\nhold a distinguished place, as an imaginative people. Shakespeare alone\r\nwould stamp a language with immortality. The British novels stand high\r\namong works of imagination, and they have generally had the merit of\r\nadvancing the cause of morality. Had French novelists attended more to\r\nthis, their knowledge of the human heart and the brilliancy of their\r\ncomposition would have been more appreciated.\r\n\r\nPoetry of the highest stamp has fled before the utilitarian spirit of\r\nthe age; yet there is as much talent in the world, and imagination too,\r\nat the present time, as at any former period, though directed to\r\ndifferent and more important objects, because the whole aspect of the\r\nmoral world is altered. The period is come for one of those important\r\nchanges in the minds of men which occur from time to time, and form\r\ngreat epochs in the history of the human race. The whole of civilized\r\nEurope could not have been roused to the enthusiasm which led them to\r\nembark in the Crusades by the preaching of Peter the Hermit, unless the\r\npeople had been prepared for it: men were ready for the Reformation\r\nbefore the impulse was given by Luther; and Pius IX. merely applied the\r\nmatch to a train already laid. These are the barometric storms of the\r\nhuman mind.\r\n\r\nThe present state of transition has been imperceptibly in progress,\r\naided by many concurring circumstances, among which the increasing\r\nintelligence of the lower orders, and steam-travelling, have been the\r\nmost efficient. The latter has assisted eminently in the diffusion of\r\nknowledge, and has probably accelerated the crisis of public affairs on\r\nthe Continent, by giving the inhabitants of different countries\r\nopportunities of intercourse, and comparing their conditions. No\r\ninvention that has been made for ages has so levelling a tendency, which\r\naccords but too well with the present disposition of the people. The\r\nspirit of emancipation, so peculiarly characteristic of this century,\r\nappears in all the relations of life, political and social. On the\r\ncontinent of Europe it has shaken the whole fabric of society, subverted\r\nlaw and order, and ruined thousands, in order to throw down the\r\ncrumbling remains of the feudal system. The same emancipating spirit\r\nwhich has thrown young and old into a state of insubordination and\r\nrebellion abroad, has been quietly but gradually altering the relations\r\nof social and domestic life at home. Parent and child no longer stand in\r\nthe same relation to one another; even at an early age boys assume the\r\ncharacter and independence of men, which may perhaps fit them sooner for\r\ntaking their share in the affairs of the world; for it must be\r\nacknowledged that, whether from early independence or some other cause,\r\nno country has produced more youthful and able statesmen than our own;\r\nbut, at the same time, it places them on a less amicable and more\r\ndangerous position, by depriving them of the advice and experience of\r\nthe aged, to which the same deference is no longer paid. The working man\r\nconsiders his interest to be at variance with that of the manufacturer,\r\nand the attachment of servants to their masters is nearly as extinct in\r\nBritain as vassalage. Ambition, to a great extent, pervades the inferior\r\nand middle grades of society, and so few are satisfied with the\r\ncondition in which they were born, that the pressure upwards is\r\nenormous. The numerous instances of men rising from an inferior rank to\r\nthe highest offices in the State encourages the endeavour to rise in\r\nsociety, which is right and natural, if pursued by legitimate means, but\r\nthe levelling disposition so prevalent abroad is pernicious as it is\r\nimpracticable. So long as men are endowed with different dispositions\r\nand different talents, so long will they differ in condition and\r\nfortune, and this is as strongly marked in republics as in any other\r\nform of government; for man, with all his attempts to liberate himself\r\nfrom nature’s ordinances, by the establishment of equal laws and civil\r\nrights, never can escape from them—inequality of condition is permanent\r\nas the human race. Hence, from necessity we must fulfil the duties of\r\nthe station in which we are placed, bearing in mind that, while\r\nChristianity requires the poor to endure their lot with patience, it\r\nimposes a heavy responsibility on the rich.\r\n\r\nIn Britain, respect for the labouring classes, together with active\r\nbenevolence, form the counterpoise to the evil propensities of this\r\nstate of transition; a benevolence which is not confined to alms-giving,\r\nbut which consists in the earnest desire to contribute with energy to\r\nthe sum of human happiness. In proportion as that disposition is\r\ndiffused among the higher classes, and the more they can convince the\r\nlower orders that they have an ardent desire to afford them every source\r\nof happiness and comfort that is in their power, so much sooner will the\r\ntransient evils pass away, and an improved state of things will\r\ncommence; kindly and confiding feelings will then take the place of\r\ncoldness and mistrust.\r\n\r\nThe continual increase of that disinterested benevolence and liberal\r\nsentiment, which in our own country is the most hopeful and consoling\r\nfeature of the age, manifests itself in the frequency with which plans\r\nfor ameliorating the condition of the lower classes are brought before\r\nParliament; in the societies formed for their relief; and in the many\r\ninstitutions established for their benefit and comfort.\r\n\r\nThree of the most beneficial systems of modern times are due to the\r\nbenevolence of English ladies—the improvement of prison discipline,\r\nsavings-banks, and banks for lending small sums to the poor. The success\r\nof all has exceeded every expectation, and these admirable institutions\r\nare now adopted by several foreign countries. The importance of popular\r\nand agricultural education is becoming an object of attention to the\r\nmore enlightened governments; and one of the greatest improvements in\r\neducation is, that teachers are now fitted for their duties, by being\r\ntaught the art of teaching. The gentleness with which instruction is\r\nconveyed no longer blights the joyous days of youth, but, on the\r\ncontrary, encourages self-education, which is the most efficient.\r\n\r\nThe system of infant-schools, established in many parts of Europe and\r\nthroughout the United States of America, is rapidly improving the\r\ncondition of the people. The instruction given in them is suited to the\r\nstation of the scholars, and the moral lessons taught are often\r\nreflected back on the uneducated parents by their children. Moreover,\r\nthe personal intercourse with the higher orders, and the kindness which\r\nthe children receive from them, strengthen the bond of reciprocal good\r\nfeeling. Since the abolition of the feudal system, the separation\r\nbetween the higher and the lower classes of society has been increasing;\r\nbut the generous exertions of individuals, whose only object is to do\r\ngood, is now beginning to correct a tendency that, unchecked, might have\r\nled to the worst consequences to all ranks. We learn from statistical\r\nreports that the pains taken by individuals and associations are not\r\nwithout their effect upon the character of the nation. For example,\r\nduring the eleven years that preceded 1846, in which the criminal\r\nreturns indicated the intellectual condition of persons accused, there\r\nwere 31 counties in England and Wales in which not one educated woman\r\nwas called before a court of law, in a population of 2,617,653\r\nfemales.[201]\r\n\r\nCrime has generally decreased in proportion to the religious and moral\r\neducation of the people: the improvement in the morality of the\r\nfactory-children is immense since Government appointed inspectors to\r\nsuperintend their health and education;[202] and indeed the improvement\r\nin the condition of the whole population appears from the bills of\r\nmortality, which unquestionably prove that the duration of human life is\r\ncontinually increasing throughout Great Britain.[203]\r\n\r\nThe voluntary sacrifices that have been made to relieve the necessities\r\nof a famishing nation evince the humane disposition of the age. But it\r\nis not one particular and extraordinary case, however admirable, that\r\nmarks the general progress—it is not in the earthquake or the storm, but\r\nin the still small voice of consolation heard in the cabin of the\r\nwretched, that is the prominent feature of the charities of the present\r\ntime, when the benevolent of all ranks seek for distress in the abodes\r\nof poverty and vice, to aid and to reform. No language can do justice to\r\nthe merit of those who devote themselves to the reformation of the\r\nchildren who have hitherto wandered neglected in the streets of great\r\ncities; in the unpromising task they have laboured with patience,\r\nundismayed by difficulties that might have discouraged the most\r\ndetermined—but they have had their reward, they have succeeded.[204] The\r\nlanguage of kindness and sympathy, never before heard by these children\r\nof crime and wretchedness, is saving multitudes from perdition. But it\r\nwould require a volume to enumerate the exertions that are making for\r\nthe accommodation, health, and improvement of the people, and the\r\ndevotion of high and low to the introduction of new establishments and\r\nthe amelioration of the old. Noble and liberal sentiments mark the\r\nproceedings of public assemblies, whether in the cause of nations or of\r\nindividuals, and the severity of our penal laws is mitigated by a milder\r\nsystem. Happily this liberal and benevolent spirit is not confined to\r\nBritain, it is universal in the States of the American Union, and it is\r\nspreading widely through the more civilized countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nNo retrograde movement can now take place in civilization; the diffusion\r\nof Christian virtues and of knowledge ensures the progressive\r\nadvancement of man in those high moral and intellectual qualities that\r\nconstitute his true dignity. But much yet remains to be done at home,\r\nespecially in religious instruction and the prevention of crime; and\r\nmillions of our fellow-creatures in both hemispheres are still in the\r\nlowest grade of barbarism. Ages and ages must pass away before they can\r\nbe civilized; but if there be any analogy between the period of man’s\r\nduration on earth and that of the frailest plant or shell-fish of the\r\ngeological periods, he must still be in his infancy; and let those who\r\ndoubt of his indefinite improvement compare the first revolution in\r\nFrance with the last, or the state of Europe in the middle ages with\r\nwhat it is at present. For, notwithstanding the disturbed condition of\r\nthe Continent, and the mistaken means the people employ to improve their\r\nposition, crime is less frequent and less atrocious than it was in\r\nformer times, and the universal indignation it now raises is a strong\r\nindication of improvement. In our own country, men who seem to have\r\nlived before their time were formerly prosecuted and punished for\r\nopinions which are now sanctioned by the legislature, and acknowledged\r\nby all. The moral disposition of the age appears in the refinement of\r\nconversation. Selfishness and evil passions may possibly ever be found\r\nin the human breast, but the progress of the race will consist in the\r\nincreasing power of public opinion, the collective voice of mankind\r\nregulated by the Christian principles of morality and justice. The\r\nindividuality of man modifies his opinions and belief; it is a part of\r\nthat variety which is a universal law of nature; so that there will\r\nprobably always be a difference of views as to religious doctrine,\r\nwhich, however, will become more spiritual, and freer from the taint of\r\nhuman infirmity; but the power of the Christian religion will appear in\r\npurer conduct, and in the more general practice of mutual forbearance,\r\ncharity, and love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n  Table of the Heights above the Sea of some of the Principal Mountain\r\n                                Chains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EUROPE.\r\n\r\n ---------------------------------+------------+-------------+-------------\r\n  Names of Places, Mountains, &c. |   Heights  |  Countries  | Authorities.\r\n                                  | in English |  in which   |\r\n                                  |    Feet.   |  situated.  |\r\n ---------------------------------+------------+-------------+-------------\r\n    MONT BLANC                    | 15,739     |Alps, P.[205]|  P.

The trunks were from twelve to fifteen\r\n  feet high, before they divided into many horizontal branches, which\r\n  touched the ground at their extremities; these were from forty-five to\r\n  fifty-five feet long, and were so large that each branch was equal to\r\n  a monstrous tree; and where the water of a neighboring river had\r\n  washed away the earth, so as to leave the roots of one of these trees\r\n  bare and open to the sight, they measured 110 feet long, without\r\n  including those parts of the roots which remained covered.

The sine of the latitude is a perpendicular line drawn\r\n  from any point of a terrestrial meridian to the equatorial radius of\r\n  the earth. That line expressed in feet or miles, and multiplied by\r\n  itself, is the square of the sine of the latitude. Gravitation\r\n  increases from the equator to the poles according to that law, and the\r\n  length of the degrees augments very nearly in the same ratio.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  The compression deduced by M. Bessel from arcs of the meridian is\r\n  1/299; that deduced by Colonel Sabine from his experiment with the\r\n  pendulum is 1/288·7. Other pendulum experiments have given a\r\n  compression of 1/298·2 and 1/266·4. The protuberant matter at the\r\n  earth’s equator produces inequalities in the moon’s motions, from\r\n  whence the compression of the earth is found to be 1/305·05; and\r\n  although the reciprocal action of the moon on the protuberant matter\r\n  at the earth’s equator does not actually give the compression, it\r\n  proves that it must be between 1/279 and 1/573. Coincidences so near\r\n  and so remarkable, arising from such different methods, show how\r\n  nearly the irregular figure of the earth has been determined. The\r\n  inequalities in the motions of the moon and earth alluded to are\r\n  explained in Sections 5 and 11 “Connection of the Physical Sciences.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  It is clear that the mean density of the earth may be found from the\r\n  attraction of the plumb-line by mountains, or by the irregularity in\r\n  the oscillations of the pendulum, but the torsion balance is a much\r\n  more sensible instrument than either. The density determined by M.\r\n  Reich differs from that found by Mr. Baily by only one twenty-eighth\r\n  part.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  If a line be drawn from the north-eastern coast of North America\r\n  within the limit of floating ice, and if it be continued across the\r\n  southern half of Ireland and England, and prolonged eastward so as to\r\n  strike against the Ural mountains, it will mark the boundary of the\r\n  European portion of the Glacial Sea.

It is evident that a\r\n  table-land must have a greater effect on the mean height of a\r\n  continent than a chain of mountains, for, supposing both to be of the\r\n  same base and altitude, one would be exactly double the other; and\r\n  even if the mountains be the higher of the two, their upper parts\r\n  contain much less solid matter than their lower on account of the\r\n  intervals and deep valleys between the peaks.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  The author is indebted to the “Physical Geography of North America” by\r\n  H.

This method, however, will only give an\r\n  approximate value; therefore, to ascertain the mean annual temperature\r\n  at any place accurately, the mean of a number of years must be taken.\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  Lines drawn on a map or globe through all places where the mean annual\r\n  temperature is the same are isothermal lines.\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  For example, Professor Dove has found that the mean temperature of\r\n  December, January, and February, at Toronto in Canada, added to the\r\n  mean temperature of the same months at Hobart Town in Van Diemen’s\r\n  Land, exceeds the sum of the mean temperature of June, July, and\r\n  August, at the same places, added together, by 22°·7 of Fahrenheit.\r\n  Similar results, though varying in amount, were obtained for many\r\n  corresponding places in the two hemispheres, which establishes the law\r\n  given in the text.\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  In the same manner as isothermal lines are supposed to pass through\r\n  all parts of the globe where the mean temperature of the air is the\r\n  same, so the isogeothermal lines are supposed to pass through all\r\n  places where the mean heat of the ground is the same: the isotherial\r\n  lines are supposed to be drawn through all places having the same mean\r\n  summer temperature; and the isochimenal lines pass through all places\r\n  where the mean winter temperature is the same. The practice of\r\n  representing to the eye these lines on a map or terrestrial globe is\r\n  of the greatest use in following and understanding the complicated\r\n  phenomena of temperature and magnetism.\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  If the heights above the earth increase by equal quantities, as a foot\r\n  or a mile, the densities of the strata of air, or the heights of the\r\n  barometer which are proportional to them, will decrease in geometrical\r\n  progression: for example, if the height of the barometer at the level\r\n  of the sea be 29·922 inches, it will be 14·961 inches at the height of\r\n  18,000 feet, or one-half as great; it will be one-fourth as great at\r\n  the height of 36,000 feet, one-eighth at the height of 54,000 feet,\r\n  and so on.\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  A very ingenious little instrument, called the Aneroid Barometer, has\r\n  been lately invented in France; which, at the same time that it forms\r\n  an exact and very portable _weather_-glass, in the common acceptation\r\n  of that term, may be employed with considerable accuracy in\r\n  ascertaining differences of level. Although not to be compared, as an\r\n  instrument of precision, with the ordinary mercurial barometer, it is\r\n  infinitely more portable, and gives with promptitude and accuracy\r\n  small differences of level.\r\n\r\n  A friend of the author’s has recently tested it in the latter respect\r\n  on some of our railways, and found that observations made with it\r\n  carefully will give, on a line of 200 miles in extent, the relative\r\n  levels of the different stations within a few feet. The observations\r\n  can be made in a couple of minutes. The gentleman in question writes\r\n  to us, that he considers the Aneroid Barometer will prove a very\r\n  useful instrument to the geological and the botanical traveller.\r\n\r\n  See, for a description of this instrument, a pamphlet recently\r\n  published at 84, Strand, by Mr. E. J. Dent, on the Construction and\r\n  Uses of the Aneroid Barometer. London, 1849.\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:\r\n\r\n  The moon’s orbit is very much elongated, so that her distance from the\r\n  earth varies considerably, and consequently her attractive force.\r\n  Moreover, her attraction varies with the rotation of the earth, which\r\n  brings her twice in 24 hours in the meridian of any place, once in the\r\n  superior and once in the inferior meridian; but her action on the\r\n  atmosphere is much inferior to that of the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Pentland has, however, found in the Peru-Bolivian Andes, at\r\n  elevations between 11,000 and 14,000 feet, the horary oscillations of\r\n  the barometer as regular, and nearly as extensive, as on the level of\r\n  the sea in the same latitude.\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant Maury, of the United States Navy, is led to believe that\r\n  there is a region within the limit of the N.E. trade-winds, in the\r\n  Atlantic, in which the prevailing winds are from the south and west:\r\n  this region is somewhat in the shape of a wedge, with its base towards\r\n  the coast of Africa, between the equator and 10° N. lat., and between\r\n  the meridians of 10° and 25° W. long. In this space, in which the law\r\n  of the trade-winds is reversed, there are great atmospheric\r\n  disturbances, violent squalls, sudden gusts of wind, thunder, storms,\r\n  heavy rains, baffling airs, and calms.\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  In the northern hemisphere, a north wind sets out with a less rotatory\r\n  motion than the places have at which it successively arrives,\r\n  consequently it veers through all the points of the compass from N. to\r\n  N.E. and E. If a south wind should now spring up, it would gradually\r\n  veer from S. to S.W. and W., because its rotatory velocity would be\r\n  greater than that of the places it successively comes to. The\r\n  combination of the two would cause a vane to veer from E. to S.E. and\r\n  S.; but the rotation of the earth would now cause the south wind to\r\n  veer round from S. to S.W. and W.; and should a north wind now arise,\r\n  its combination with the west wind would bring the vane round from W.\r\n  to N.W. and N. again. At the Greenwich Observatory the wind makes five\r\n  gyrations in that direction in the course of a year. In Europe it is\r\n  the contention of the N.E. and S.W. winds which causes the rotation of\r\n  the wind, and the principal changes of weather, the S.W. being warm\r\n  and moist, the N.E. cold and dry, except where it comes over the\r\n  German Ocean.\r\n\r\nFootnote 138:\r\n\r\n  In all hurricanes hitherto observed, the sinking of the mercury, and\r\n  the increase of the wind, have been more or less regularly progressive\r\n  till within three or four hours’ sail of the centre of the storm; and\r\n  in one class they have continued so even to the centre; while in\r\n  another class, and by far the most terrible, the depression of the\r\n  mercury has been sudden and excessive when within that distance of the\r\n  centre, and the violence of the tempest far beyond the average. When a\r\n  ship is within 50 or 60 miles of the centre, the storm has the\r\n  mastery, and seamanship is of little avail. Rules for avoiding this\r\n  calamity, and for managing a ship when involved in a hurricane, are\r\n  fully explained in the “Sailor’s Horn-Book for the Laws of Storms,” by\r\n  H. Piddington, Esq., President of the Marine Courts of Inquiry at\r\n  Calcutta. The following approximate table is given by him, to serve as\r\n  a guide till better data shall be obtained:—\r\n\r\n        Average fall of the       Distance of a ship from the\r\n        barometer per hour.       centre of the storm, in miles.\r\n\r\n        From  0·020 to 0·060      From 250 to 150\r\n\r\n        From  0·060 to 0·080      From 150 to 100\r\n\r\n        From  0·080 to 0·120      From 100 to  80\r\n\r\n        From  0·120 to 0·150      From  80 to  50\r\n\r\n  The rate of fall per hour doubles after the storm has lasted six\r\n  hours, and within three hours of the centre of the hurricane the\r\n  mercury will fall four times as fast, if it be of the violent class.\r\n\r\n  Colonel James Capper discovered the rotatory motions of storms, and W.\r\n  C. Redfield, Esq., of New York, was the first who determined their\r\n  laws. Colonel Reid, Governor of Barbadoes, and Dr. Thom, of the 86th\r\n  regiment, have also written on the subject.\r\n\r\nFootnote 139:\r\n\r\n  The four subordinate forms of clouds are the cirro-stratus, composed\r\n  of little bands of filaments, more compact than the cirrus, forming\r\n  horizontal strata, which seem to be numerous thin clouds when in the\r\n  zenith, and at the horizon a long narrow band. The cumulo-stratus\r\n  consists of the summer-cloud, like snowy mountains heaped on one\r\n  another, which at sunrise have a black or bluish tint at the horizon,\r\n  and pass into the nimbus, or rain-cloud, which has a uniform grey\r\n  tint, fringed at the edges; and the fourth is the cirro-cumulus, a\r\n  combination of filaments and heaped-up cumuli or summer-clouds.\r\n\r\nFootnote 140:\r\n\r\n  The reader is referred to the chart of the distribution of rain in the\r\n  Physical Atlas of Alexander Keith Johnston, Esq., where the value of\r\n  the practice referred to in note p. 27 is shown.\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:\r\n\r\n  The reader is referred to the “Connection of the Physical Sciences”\r\n  for an account of Dr. Dalton’s theory of definite proportions, and the\r\n  relative weight of atoms.\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  The reader is referred to the 18th section of the “Physical Sciences”\r\n  for reflection, refraction, and absorption of light, and to the 19th\r\n  section for the constitution of the solar light and colours.\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  For the cause of mirage, see the “Connection of the Physical\r\n  Sciences.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  For phenomena and theory of polarized light, see section 21,\r\n  “Connection of the Physical Sciences.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  Every substance, whether solid or fluid, has its own polarizing angle.\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  The reader is referred to a plate in “Johnston’s Physical Atlas”\r\n  showing the phenomena of the polarization of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  See sections 28 and 29 of the “Connection of the Physical Sciences:”\r\n  on Electricity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:\r\n\r\n  Sound travels at the rate of 1120 feet in a second in air at the\r\n  temperature of 62° of Fahrenheit; so if that number be multiplied by\r\n  the seconds elapsed between the flash of lightning and the thunder,\r\n  the result will be the distance in feet at which the stroke took\r\n  place.\r\n\r\nFootnote 149:\r\n\r\n  Colonel Sabine’s Notes to “Kosmos.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 150:\r\n\r\n  The foci are all of different intensities; that in the South Atlantic,\r\n  discovered by M.

The chemical rays are most abundant beyond the violet\r\n  end of the spectrum, and decrease through the violet, blue, and green,\r\n  to the yellow, where they cease. The rays of heat are in excess a\r\n  little beyond the red end, and gradually decrease towards the violet\r\n  end. Besides these there are two insulated spots at a considerable\r\n  distance from the red, where the heat is a maximum. Were the rays of\r\n  heat visible, they would exhibit differences as distinct as the\r\n  coloured rays, so varied are their properties according to their\r\n  position in the spectrum. There are also peculiar rays which produce\r\n  phosphorescence, others whose properties are not quite made out, and\r\n  probably many undiscovered influences; for time has not yet fully\r\n  revealed the sublimity of that creation, when God said, “Let there be\r\n  light—and there was light.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  Professor Quetelet is desirous that the periodical phenomena of\r\n  vegetation should be observed at a number of places, in order to\r\n  establish a comparison between the periods at which they take place;\r\n  and for that purpose he gives a list of the commonest plants, as\r\n  lilac, laburnum, elder, birch, oak, horse-chestnut, peach, pear,\r\n  crocus, daisy, &c., which he himself observes annually at Brussels.\r\n\r\nFootnote 156:\r\n\r\n  Dandelion opens at five or six in the morning, and shuts at nine in\r\n  the evening; the goat’s-beard wakes at three in the morning, and shuts\r\n  at five or six in the afternoon.

To these,\r\n  other divisions might be added, as the Galapagos, which is so strongly\r\n  defined.\r\n\r\n  Baron Humboldt gives the following concise view of the distribution of\r\n  plants, both as to height and latitude:—\r\n\r\n  The equatorial zone is the region of palms and bananas.\r\n\r\n  The tropical zone is the region of tree-ferns and figs.\r\n\r\n  The subtropical zone, that of myrtles and laurels.\r\n\r\n  The warm temperate zone, that of evergreen trees.\r\n\r\n  The cold temperate zone, that of European or deciduous trees.\r\n\r\n  The subarctic zone, that of pines.\r\n\r\n  The arctic zone, that of rhododendrons.\r\n\r\n  The polar zone, that of alpine plants.\r\n\r\n  _Upper Limit of Trees on Mountains._—The upper limit of trees is\r\n  distinguished by the Escalloniæ, on the Andes of Quito, at the height\r\n  of 11,500 feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n  In tropical Mexico, the upper limit of trees, at the height of 12,789\r\n  feet, is distinguished by the Pinus occidentalis.\r\n\r\n  In the temperate zone the limit of trees is marked by the Quercus\r\n  Semicarpifolia, at 11,500 feet, on the south side of the Himalaya, and\r\n  by the Betula Alba, on the north side, at the height of 14,000 feet:\r\n  the same birch forms the limit on the Caucasus, at the elevation of\r\n  6394 feet. On the Pyrenees and Alps the limit is marked by the\r\n  Coniferæ or pine tribe: on the Pyrenees by the Pinus uncinata, at the\r\n  height of 10,870 feet; on the south side of the Alps by the larch, at\r\n  the elevation of 6700 feet; and by the Pinus abies, at 5883 feet, on\r\n  the north.\r\n\r\n  In Lapland, the Betula Alba forms the upper limit of trees, at the\r\n  height of only 1918 feet.\r\n\r\n  _The upper Limit of Shrubs._—In the Andes of Quito the Bejarias are\r\n  the shrubs that attain the greatest height, and terminate at 13,420\r\n  feet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\n  The juniper, Salix, and Ribes, or currant tribe, form the upper limit\r\n  of Shrubs on the south side of the Himalaya, at the height of 11,500\r\n  feet. The tama, or Genista versicolor, a species of broom, flourishes\r\n  at the height of 17,000 feet on the north side, and vegetation is\r\n  prolonged to nearly 18,000 feet.\r\n\r\n  The Rhododendron forms the upper limit of shrubs on the Caucasus, at\r\n  8825 feet; in the Pyrenees it grows to 8312 feet; in the Alps to 7480\r\n  feet; and in Lapland it forms the upper limit of shrubs at an\r\n  elevation of 3000 above the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nFootnote 158:\r\n\r\n  The British flora contains at least 3000 species.\r\n\r\nFootnote 159:\r\n\r\n  The plants with which the Chinese give flavour to tea are the Olea\r\n  fragrans, Chloranthus inconspicuus, Gardenia florida, Aglaia odorata,\r\n  Mogorium sambac, Vitex spicata, Camellia sasanqua, Camellia odorifera,\r\n  Illicium anisatum, Magnolia yulan, Rosa indica odoratissima, turmeric,\r\n  oil of Bixa orellana, and the root of the Florentine iris.\r\n\r\n  The principles of caffeine and theine are, in all respects, identical.\r\n\r\nFootnote 160:\r\n\r\n  Davis on China.\r\n\r\nFootnote 161:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Mantel.\r\n\r\nFootnote 162:\r\n\r\n  Dr. J.

There are several\r\n  undetermined botanical marine provinces in the Pacific and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFootnote 172:\r\n\r\n  The British flowering sea-weeds are the Zostera and Zanichellia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 173:\r\n\r\n  The vegetation at different depths in the Egean Sea is as distinctly\r\n  marked as that at different heights on the declivity of a mountain.\r\n  The coast plants are the Padina pavonia and Dictyota dichotoma. A\r\n  greater depth is characterized by the vividly green and elegant fronds\r\n  of the Caulerpa prolifera, probably the prasium of the ancients;\r\n  associated with it are the curious sponge-like Codium Bursa, and four\r\n  or five others. The Codium flabelliforme, and the rare and curious\r\n  vegetable net called Microdictyon umbilicatum, characterize depths of\r\n  30 fathoms. The Dictyomenia, with stiff purple corkscrew-like fronds,\r\n  and some others, go as low as 50 fathoms, beyond which no flexible\r\n  sea-weeds have been found. The coral-like Millepora polymorpha take\r\n  their place, and range to the depth of 100 fathoms, beyond which there\r\n  is no trace of vegetable life, unless some of the minute and\r\n  microscopic infusorial bodies living there be regarded as plants.—\r\n  “Travels in Lycia,” by Lieutenant Spratt, R. N., and Professor E.\r\n  Forbes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 174:\r\n\r\n  The notocanthus and macrourus are the deep-water fish in the arctic\r\n  regions; they also inhabit the seas of New Zealand. The Pacific fish\r\n  that enter the Atlantic are some of the mackerel tribe, sharks, and\r\n  lophobranches. The genera most prevalent in the southern hemisphere\r\n  are the notothemia, borichthys, and harpagifer. The same species of\r\n  these genera are found in the seas of the Falkland Islands, Cape Horn,\r\n  the Auckland Islands, and Kerguelen’s Land.—Dr. Richardson.\r\n\r\nFootnote 175:\r\n\r\n  The Chinese fresh-water fish are cyprinidæ, ophicephali, and siluridæ—\r\n  genera which agree closely with those in India, though the species are\r\n  different.\r\n\r\nFootnote 176:\r\n\r\n  The carnivorous Cetacea, with two remarkable exceptions, inhabit the\r\n  ocean—the Delphinus Inca, of the Amazons and its affluents; and the D.\r\n  Gangeticus, of the Ganges.\r\n\r\nFootnote 177:\r\n\r\n  Captain Scoresby’s “Arctic Voyages.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 178:\r\n\r\n  One of the most celebrated species of this division is the crocodile\r\n  of the Nile, which probably is to be met with in the western branch of\r\n  that river, the Bahr-el-Abiad, as high as 4000 feet. Immense numbers\r\n  of this species, of every size and age, are found embalmed in the\r\n  catacombs of the ancient Egyptians, which are perfectly identical with\r\n  the existing species, and offering another proof of the important fact\r\n  first announced by Cuvier, from his examination of the mummies of the\r\n  ibis, that no animal, in its wild state, had presented the least\r\n  change, within the longest historical periods.\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Pentland informs me that crocodiles are found in some of the\r\n  rivers of Bolivia at a much greater elevation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:\r\n\r\n  Animals of a gigantic size, and allied to the lizard family, formerly\r\n  inhabited the latitudes of Britain. A monster (the Mosasaurus) much\r\n  surpassing the largest living crocodile is found in our Sussex\r\n  chalk-beds; and an animal allied to the Iguana, the iguanodon of\r\n  Mantell, is of frequent occurrence in the strata upon which the chalk\r\n  reposes in the weald of Sussex, the Isle of Wight, &c. Some bones of\r\n  the iguanodon would indicate an animal more than 50 feet long.\r\n\r\nFootnote 181:\r\n\r\n  Petrel, from St. Peter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:\r\n\r\n  In some parts of the earth the same conditions which regulated the\r\n  distribution of the ancient fauna and flora still prevail. The flora\r\n  of the carbonaceous epoch is perfectly similar to that of New Zealand,\r\n  where ferns and club-mosses are so abundant; and the fauna of that\r\n  ancient period had been representative of that which recently\r\n  prevailed in these islands, since foot-prints of colossal birds have\r\n  been discovered in the red sandstone of Connecticut.\r\n\r\n  The age of reptiles of the Wealden and other secondary periods is\r\n  representative of the fauna of the Galapagos islands, which chiefly\r\n  consists of tortoises and creatures of the lizard or crocodile family;\r\n  and the cycadaceous plants and marsupial animals of the oolite are\r\n  representative of the flora and fauna of Australia.\r\n\r\n  The colossal birds which prevailed in New Zealand, almost to the\r\n  entire exclusion of reptiles and quadrupeds, lasted to a very late\r\n  period; they differed in the structure of the beak and skull from\r\n  every class of birds, recent or fossil.\r\n\r\nFootnote 183:\r\n\r\n  Perhaps no quadruped in the wild state will be found to have so wide a\r\n  vertical range of habitat as this animal. It is found in the plains of\r\n  Tartary, in the valley of the Tigris, at a very few feet above the\r\n  sea-level, and in the most elevated plains of the Himalaya, at\r\n  elevations exceeding 15,300 feet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 184:\r\n\r\n  It is by no means certain that the wild Ass of the three countries\r\n  mentioned in the text belongs to the same species. The Kiang of Tibet\r\n  appears to be the same as the Dziggetai (Equus Hemonus) of Pallas,\r\n  which is met with throughout central Asia; but the species found in\r\n  the Run of Cutch is of a different colour and form: whilst the one\r\n  neighs like a horse, the other brays like an ass; in one the striped\r\n  colour of the zebra family exists in the young, and not in the second.\r\n\r\nFootnote 185:\r\n\r\n  The attention of the scientific world in France has been recently\r\n  directed to the advantages that might arise from the naturalization of\r\n  the Llama tribe in Europe, and especially of its two most useful\r\n  species, the Llama and the Alpaca. M. J. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, a\r\n  zoologist of some note, but rather carried away by theoretical views\r\n  in a branch of science where observation, and observation alone, ought\r\n  to be our guide, and ignorant perhaps of what had been done in England\r\n  on the same subject, where the experiment had long since been tried,\r\n  and with very inadequate success, has presented lately some papers to\r\n  the Academy of Sciences on this subject. We cannot imagine, even if\r\n  the naturalization of the Llama on a large scale was possible, what\r\n  benefit could arise from it to our agriculturists. The wool of the\r\n  llama is coarse, and so infinitely inferior to the commonest qualities\r\n  of sheep’s wool, that in its native country it is seldom used for any\r\n  other purpose than the manufacture of ropes, of a rough carpeting and\r\n  packing-cloth, and for the coarsest apparel of the poor Indian. As to\r\n  its use as a beast of burden, whilst the llama eats as much as the\r\n  ass, it does not carry more than one half what he can, and can\r\n  scarcely travel one half of the same daily distance; besides, the\r\n  female llama is useless in this respect. The flesh of the llama, as\r\n  above stated, is greatly below that of all our domestic animals, even\r\n  of the Italian buffalo.\r\n\r\n  As to the Alpaca, it is very doubtful if, living as it does in an\r\n  extremely dry, elevated, equable, and clear atmosphere, it would ever\r\n  become accustomed to the damp and variable climate of our northern\r\n  latitudes, or to that of the great European chains of mountains, the\r\n  Alps and the Pyrenees, and if it did, that its wool would not be\r\n  greatly deteriorated. As to the vicuña, it is purely a wild species,\r\n  and has hitherto resisted all the efforts of the aborigines, the most\r\n  patient and docile of the human race, to render it prolific in its own\r\n  climate and in domesticity.\r\n\r\n  It appears, therefore, that the domestication of the several species\r\n  of Auchenia in Europe would be a costly and useless experiment, on the\r\n  large scale on which it is proposed to try it; indeed, this will\r\n  appear evident when it is known that in the Peru-Bolivian Andes the\r\n  llama and alpaca are daily disappearing to make room for the more\r\n  useful and profitable breed of the common European sheep, whilst, as a\r\n  beast of burden, the ass is everywhere taking its place.\r\n\r\n  Connected with this subject, a very singular fact, and, if well\r\n  established, a very curious one, has been announced by M. Geoffroy St.\r\n  Hilaire, on the authority of one of our countrymen, Dr. Weddel,\r\n  recently returned from South America, that a cross-breed between the\r\n  Alpaca and the Vicuña had been obtained, and that the mules from this\r\n  cross-breed were capable of reproducing this newly-created species,\r\n  the wool of which is represented to be of a valuable quality. Now, if\r\n  there exists in zoological science a fact clearly established, it is\r\n  this: that within historical periods no new species of vertebrate\r\n  animal has been created—in fact, the great law of the immutability of\r\n  species. The remains of the several wild animals which have been\r\n  buried for more than 30 centuries in the catacombs of Egypt, and in\r\n  the ruins of Nineveh, are perfectly identical with those now existing\r\n  in the most minute details of their anatomical structure. We have\r\n  examined, in the case referred to, the evidence adduced by M. Geoffroy\r\n  St. Hilaire in support of his favourite doctrine, and we do not by any\r\n  means consider it sufficient to shake the conclusions arrived at by\r\n  all the great zoologists of past and present times—by the Cuviers, the\r\n  Humboldts, and the Owens of our own period—on the impossibility of the\r\n  production of a new species of animals, or the immutability of species\r\n  in the animal creation. Contradictions to this law we know have been\r\n  brought forward by writers of the theoretical school of naturalists,\r\n  to support favourite theories of their authors; but we believe such\r\n  dangerous doctrines are founded on the vagaries of a school which have\r\n  ever placed in natural history observation in the back, and the dreams\r\n  of imagination in the foreground.\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:\r\n\r\n  There are 8 families, 14 genera, and 123 species of marsupial animals,\r\n  amounting to about one-twelfth of all the mammalia. The opossum is\r\n  American; the seven other families are inhabitants of Australia and\r\n  the Indian Archipelago.\r\n\r\n  Of the Didelphidæ or opossum family there are 21 species, all\r\n  inhabitants of America; the Virginian opossum is about the size of a\r\n  cat, the other species are not larger than rats or mice. A pretty kind\r\n  in Surinam, the D. dorsigera, is so named because it carries its young\r\n  on its back, which hold on by their prehensile tails twisted round\r\n  that of the mother: another species is aquatic, and in its habits\r\n  resembles the otter.\r\n\r\n  The Dasyuridæ and Phalangers are nocturnal: the Dasyuridæ and wombats\r\n  burrow.\r\n\r\nFootnote 187:\r\n\r\n  Sir Charles Lyell estimates the number of existing species of animals\r\n  and vegetables, independent of the infusoria, to be between one and\r\n  two millions, which must surely be under the mark, considering the\r\n  enormous quantity of animal life in the ocean, to the amount of which\r\n  we have not even an approximation. If the microscopic and infusorial\r\n  existence be taken into the account, the surface of the globe may be\r\n  viewed as one mass of animal life—perpetually dying—perpetually\r\n  renewed. A drop of stagnant water is a world within itself, an epitome\r\n  of the earth and its successive geological races. A variety of\r\n  microscopic creatures appear, and die; in a few days a new set\r\n  succeeds; these vanish and give place to a third set, of different\r\n  kinds from the preceding; and the débris of all remain at the bottom\r\n  of the glass. The extinction of these creatures takes place without\r\n  any apparent cause, unless a greater degree of putrescence of the\r\n  water be to them what the mighty geological catastrophes were to\r\n  beings of higher organization—the introduction of the new is not more\r\n  mysterious in one case than in the other.\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:\r\n\r\n  Valmiki, the Hindu poet, is supposed to have been contemporary with\r\n  Homer, if not his predecessor: his great work is the “Ramayana,” an\r\n  heroic poem of the highest order, four cantos of which have been\r\n  translated by Gaspare Gorresco, an Italian. According to Dr.\r\n  Pritchard, the four great dynasties of languages in the old continent\r\n  are—the Indo-European or Indo-Germanic, now called the Arian or\r\n  Iranian languages; the Turanian or Ugro-Tartarian, the language of\r\n  high Asia; the Chinese and Indo-Chinese, or Monosyllabic; and the\r\n  Syro-Arabian or Semitic languages. The three first are common to\r\n  Europe and Asia; the fourth, common to Africa and some parts of Asia\r\n  near Africa. The Arians are the ancient Medes and Persian; the Ugrians\r\n  are the Fins, Laplanders, Hungarians, and many Siberian nations.\r\n\r\nFootnote 189:\r\n\r\n  EUROPEAN POPULATION.\r\n\r\n                              _Pure blood._\r\n\r\n Teutonic                                         52,000,000\r\n Sclavonian                                       50,000,000\r\n Celtic                                           12,000,000\r\n Magyar                                            9,000,000\r\n Fins and Samojedes                                3,000,000\r\n Tartar                                            2,000,000\r\n Jews                                              2,000,000\r\n                                                 -----------\r\n Total European population of pure blood         130,000,000\r\n\r\n                         _Mixed blood in Europe._\r\n\r\n Teutonic Celtic                                  22,000,000\r\n Teutonic Sclavonian                               6,000,000\r\n Teutonic mixed with Walloons in Belgium           1,200,000\r\n Teutonic Northmen in Normandy                     1,500,000\r\n Celtic in its different crosses                  56,000,000\r\n Sclavonian                                        6,000,000\r\n Lettons                                           2,000,000\r\n Turks                                             4,000,000\r\n Turco-Tatar-Sclavonic in centre, south-east,\r\n   and east of Russia                              2,600,000\r\n Kalmuk, between the rivers Volga and Ural           300,000\r\n                                                 -----------\r\n The number of people of mixed blood in Europe   101,600,000\r\n\r\n  The total population of Europe, pure and mixed, amounts to about 232\r\n  millions, including 600,000 Gipsies.

The\r\n  Chevalier Bunsen has ascertained, from monumental inscriptions, that\r\n  the successive Egyptian dynasties may be traced back to Meres, 3640\r\n  years before the Christian era, and from the high state of\r\n  civilization during the reign of that prince, proved by the\r\n  magnificence of the works thus executed, he infers that the Egyptians\r\n  must have existed 500 years previous to their consolidation into one\r\n  empire by him, which goes back to the renewed period of man’s\r\n  creation. Compared with geological periods, man is of very recent\r\n  creation, as appears from the vast extent of uninhabited land, but\r\n  which would require ages and ages to people, even if the increase of\r\n  population were as rapid as in the United States of North America.\r\n\r\nFootnote 192:\r\n\r\n  Dark-coloured substances absorb more of the sun’s heat than\r\n  light-coloured ones; therefore, the black skins of the natives of\r\n  tropical climates absorb more heat than fair skins, but, from some\r\n  unknown cause, the black skin is protected from a degree of heat that\r\n  would blister a fair one.\r\n\r\nFootnote 193:\r\n\r\n  The countenances of the Fuegians brought to England in 1830 by Captain\r\n  Fitzroy improved greatly in expression by their intercourse with\r\n  civilized men, but they had not returned to their savage brethren more\r\n  than a year before their whole appearance was completely changed; the\r\n  look of intelligence they had acquired was gone; and when compared\r\n  with likenesses that had been taken of them when in England, they were\r\n  not to be recognized as the same persons.\r\n\r\nFootnote 194:\r\n\r\n  Johnston’s “Physical Atlas.”\r\n\r\n  The average age of a nation, or the mean duration of life, has a\r\n  considerable influence on the character of a people. The average age\r\n  of the population of England and Wales is 26 years 7 months. By the\r\n  census, the average age of the population of the United States of\r\n  North America is 22 years 2 months. In England there are 1365 persons\r\n  in every 10,000, who have attained 50 years of age, and consequently\r\n  of experience; while, in the United States, only 830 in each 10,000\r\n  have arrived at that age: hence, in the United States, the moral\r\n  predominance of the young and passionate is greatest. In Ireland there\r\n  are 1050 persons in every 10,000 of the population, above 50 years of\r\n  age, to exercise the influence of their age and experience upon the\r\n  community—an influence that will diminish with the progress of\r\n  emancipation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 195:\r\n\r\n  It is singular that the British should, for years, have possessed such\r\n  extensive territories in Asia without having explored their mineral\r\n  wealth. Perhaps the quantity of gold recently discovered in California\r\n  and Africa may call the attention of the East India Company to the\r\n  subject. Some of the richest mining districts are in countries where\r\n  primary formations have been crossed or disturbed by volcanic action;\r\n  and as that is eminently the case along the eastern coast of the Bay\r\n  of Bengal, from Aracan to the peninsula of Malacca, mines of the\r\n  precious metals will most likely be found on that frontier, possibly\r\n  in Siam and the Birman empire. The interior of the Deccan has also\r\n  been greatly disturbed by ancient volcanos; and as that country is\r\n  said to bear a strong analogy in structure to South Africa, it may\r\n  also resemble it in the production of gold. The auriferous territory\r\n  in California appears to be at least 400 miles long and 100 broad.\r\n\r\nFootnote 196:\r\n\r\n  In bringing to a close a work which may in some measure be considered\r\n  a kind of Résumé of Natural knowledge, it may not be either out of\r\n  place or irrelevant to our subject to allude more particularly to the\r\n  encouragement of late years granted to scientific investigation by our\r\n  own Government.\r\n\r\n  It must be confessed that Great Britain for a long time remained\r\n  behind the nations of the continent in fostering scientific enterprise\r\n  and research; and if England has rivalled in most branches of natural\r\n  knowledge, and surpassed in some, every other people, it has arisen\r\n  more from individual exertion, and that spirit of association which\r\n  forms so happy a characteristic of our race, and which has in our\r\n  political institutions so mainly contributed to our national greatness\r\n  and prosperity, than from any direct encouragement from our rulers.\r\n  Whilst France and other continental nations were endowing the votaries\r\n  of science, were lavishing money on scientific expeditions, and\r\n  founding institutions which will hand down the names of their\r\n  sovereigns to posterity as the benefactors of mankind, England had\r\n  done little in the same track beyond fitting out those memorable\r\n  expeditions of Cook, and, subsequently, those of Vancouver and\r\n  Flinders, and the support granted to our great national Observatory,\r\n  which, under the direction of Bradley, Maskelyne, Pond, and Airy, has\r\n  attained a degree of celebrity and utility unequalled by any\r\n  astronomical foundation in ancient or modern times.\r\n\r\n  The conclusion of a long war, in opening the scientific repositories\r\n  of the continent to our countrymen, showed us how much our great\r\n  institutions, with the above solitary exception, were behindhand, not\r\n  only in extent and utility, but in the liberality with which they were\r\n  conducted. Possessing as we did the most ample means, from our immense\r\n  colonial possessions and our widely-extended commerce, to add to the\r\n  stock of our knowledge in natural history, our collections were\r\n  infinitely behind those of the great states of the continent, and\r\n  scarcely on a par with those of the sovereigns of a second and even\r\n  third rate importance. A better system was loudly called for, and a\r\n  better system has been adopted. Our great national collection of the\r\n  British Museum—and I here refer more particularly to its scientific\r\n  and antiquarian department, for there is still much room for\r\n  improvement in the literary—has in a few years, thanks to the\r\n  liberality of Parliament and the exertions of its trustees and\r\n  officers, become equal in every respect, and superior in many, to any\r\n  similar institution on the continent. Two establishments have been\r\n  created within the last dozen of years which reflect the greatest\r\n  honour on the statesmen, Sir F. Baring, then Chancellor of the\r\n  Exchequer, and the late Earl of Besborough, as chief Commissioner of\r\n  the Woods and Forests, who fostered them in their infancy, and on the\r\n  talented individuals who had been selected to carry out the\r\n  enlightened views of the Government—the Museum of Practical Geology, a\r\n  designation that conveys a very inadequate idea of the extent of its\r\n  attributes or of its utility, and the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. To\r\n  the first the public is already indebted for such a geological survey\r\n  and map of the empire as never had been planned or executed in any\r\n  other country—only a small instalment, however, of great services\r\n  which the nation and geological science are likely to derive from the\r\n  labours of Sir H. Delabeche and his collaborators. The Royal Gardens\r\n  at Kew, under the direction of Sir W. J. Hooker, lose nothing when\r\n  compared with the most celebrated establishments of the kind, ancient\r\n  or modern: never was public money better bestowed, or in a way to\r\n  convey more useful instruction and gratification to the great mass of\r\n  the community. Whilst every German university had its Museum of\r\n  Comparative Anatomy, when the government of revolutionary France had\r\n  placed at the disposal of Cuvier ample means to lay the basis of that\r\n  science of which he was to be considered the founder, an eminent\r\n  surgeon, John Hunter, animated by the love of science alone, and\r\n  unaided by his Government, was rendering a similar service to Great\r\n  Britain, in laying the foundation of that Museum which so justly bears\r\n  his honoured name. Thanks to the liberality of the Government, and to\r\n  the well-judged appreciation of the Royal College of Surgeons, the\r\n  Hunterian Collection has become the property of the nation, and has\r\n  received such additions and ameliorations as not to be behind any of\r\n  those of the continent; whilst in point of arrangement, facilities\r\n  granted for study, and real practical utility, it infinitely surpasses\r\n  them all. To it we principally are indebted for the introduction of\r\n  the study of comparative anatomy into this country, and for the\r\n  possession of one of its greatest modern expositors, Professor Owen.\r\n\r\n  It may appear invidious, at a time when every department of our\r\n  Government is showing itself so desirous of promoting the cause of\r\n  science, to point to any in particular: still we cannot refrain from\r\n  making special mention of one to which science in general, and more\r\n  particularly that branch of it which forms the principal object of\r\n  this work, and our best national interests, owe a deep and lasting\r\n  debt of gratitude—the Hydrographic department of the Admiralty; which,\r\n  under its present able chief, Sir Francis Beaufort, has attained a\r\n  degree of eminence unequalled by that of any other maritime country.\r\n  The Admiralty has profited of a long peace to extend our knowledge\r\n  over almost every region of the globe, conferring thereby an immense\r\n  service on geographical science, and placing in the hands of our\r\n  national and commercial marine a collection of charts and nautical\r\n  instructions unparalleled in the history of navigation for their\r\n  extent and exactitude. Another branch of inquiry, closely connected\r\n  with Hydrography and Navigation, which it required the encouragement\r\n  of a government to institute, the investigation of the laws of\r\n  terrestrial magnetism and meteorology, has been very liberally\r\n  provided for by Parliament, and most ably carried out, under the\r\n  direction of Colonel Sabine, by the establishment of special\r\n  observatories in our widely extended colonies, and by the publication\r\n  and distribution of their results.\r\n\r\n  The several maritime expeditions undertaken since the peace in a\r\n  purely scientific view reflect the highest credit on the departments\r\n  of the Government with which they have originated, as they do on the\r\n  eminent individuals, many of whom still live to enjoy their\r\n  well-merited fame, who have carried out their country’s wishes. The\r\n  names of Parry, Franklin, Back, James C. Ross, and Richardson, will be\r\n  preserved in the memory of posterity long after the ephemeral glory of\r\n  their professional career will have been forgotten.\r\n\r\n  Although it is to the projectors of such an altered state of things,\r\n  and to the statesmen who encouraged and brought it about, that our\r\n  first acknowledgement is due, our thanks must be also expressed to\r\n  that branch of the legislature which, holding, as it rightly does, the\r\n  public purse, has so liberally come forward upon every occasion, when\r\n  solicited, in granting the means to promote scientific enterprise. The\r\n  votary of science therefore owes to the House of Commons the\r\n  expression of his unmingled gratitude.\r\n\r\n  But, in paying that just tribute to the ministers of the Crown and to\r\n  Parliament, we must not pass over in silence the encouragement which\r\n  science has in every department met with from the East India Company.\r\n  Lords of an immense territory, the Court of Directors, and its\r\n  representatives in India, have always shown themselves ready to\r\n  contribute in a most liberal spirit to the extension of our knowledge\r\n  of their widely extended empire. The trigonometrical surveys of India,\r\n  the establishment of observatories, the endowment of colleges and of\r\n  scientific societies, the formation of collections of natural history\r\n  at great expense, and which it distributes to all those who are likely\r\n  to make good use of them, the publication of works on physical\r\n  researches, on natural history, of astronomical observations, bestowed\r\n  with so liberal a hand to men of science, the formation of such a map\r\n  of its extended dominions and of charts of its coasts as would do\r\n  honour to any government, must place the East India Company in the\r\n  first rank of those mighty potentates of the earth to whom science\r\n  will both now and in after ages feel placed under the most lasting\r\n  obligations.\r\n\r\n  Connected with our Oriental empire, it is due to some of the native\r\n  sovereigns of India to state that they have not been behindhand in\r\n  imitating the liberal example of their powerful protectors. Two native\r\n  princes, the Rajah of Travancore and the King of Oude, have at very\r\n  great expense established astronomical observatories in their\r\n  territories, furnished with European instruments of the most delicate\r\n  construction, and placed under the direction of European officers\r\n  amply endowed and provided for. The peninsula of India at the present\r\n  moment possesses four astronomical observatories little behind those\r\n  of Europe as regards the means of observation; until very lately there\r\n  did not exist one public observatory in the whole extent of the United\r\n  States of America.\r\n\r\n  [A national observatory was established at Washington in the year\r\n  1843.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 197:\r\n\r\n  Sir John Rennie.\r\n\r\nFootnote 198:\r\n\r\n  Charles Babbage, Esq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 199:\r\n\r\n  We learn, on closing the present volume, that this distinguished\r\n  traveller, through the liberality of Her Majesty’s Government, is\r\n  again about to proceed to the former field of his exertions.\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:\r\n\r\n  The works of Cornelius and Kaulbach bear testimony to the justice of\r\n  the observations in the text. In drawing, nothing can be more\r\n  beautiful—in composition, nothing can be more varied or sublime. The\r\n  “Destruction of Jerusalem,” by Kaulbach, in which a powerful genius\r\n  has combined the truth of the historian with the imagination of the\r\n  poet, and executed with the hand of a master, might bear comparison\r\n  even with the Italian school for colouring.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:\r\n\r\n  Twenty of these counties were in England and 11 in Wales, and so few\r\n  crimes took place among educated women in the other counties during\r\n  the 11 years mentioned, that the annual proportion of accusations\r\n  against educated females was only 1 in 1,349,059. During the year 1846\r\n  only 48 educated persons were convicted of crimes out of the whole\r\n  population of England and Wales, and none were sentenced to death. And\r\n  during the years 1845 and 1846 there were 15 counties in England and\r\n  11 in Wales in which no well-educated person was convicted of any\r\n  crime. The number of accusations among educated persons in Scotland is\r\n  greater, because education is more general, and because the quantity\r\n  of ardent spirits used in Scotland is five times greater than in\r\n  England. Crime is very much below the average in the mining districts,\r\n  and it is still less frequent in Wales and in the mountainous country\r\n  in the North of England.

From a station near Captain Fitzroy’s, at Valparaiso, Captain\r\n  Beechy found the angle of elevation of Aconcagua, by several very\r\n  careful observations, to be 1° 55ʹ 45ʺ, the distance from this station\r\n  to the Peak being 88·74 geographical miles. From a discussion of all\r\n  these data, the compiler of this table has deduced for the height of\r\n  Aconcagua 23,910 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Transcriber’s Note\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book uses inconsistent spelling and hyphenation, which were\r\nretained in the ebook version. Some corrections have been made to the\r\ntext, including normalizing punctuation and capitilization, replacing\r\nditto marks with the text they represent, and correcting the spelling of\r\nIndex entries to match the spelling in the main text. Where incorrect\r\npage number references were found in the Index, these were corrected.\r\nSeveral instances of Antartic or antartic were changed to Antarctic or\r\nantarctic.
