They have no respect for property or laws. What's more,\r\nthey're powerful and organized, and have the ears of lawmakers and the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nI'm speaking, of course, of the legal departments at ebook publishers.\r\n\r\nThese people don't believe in copyright law. Copyright law says that\r\nwhen you buy a book, you own it. You can give it away, you can lend\r\nit, you can pass it on to your descendants or donate it to the local\r\nhomeless shelter. Owning books has been around for longer than\r\npublishing books has. Copyright law has *always* recognized your right\r\nto own your books. When copyright laws are made -- by elected\r\nofficials, acting for the public good -- they always safeguard this\r\nright.\r\n\r\nBut ebook publishers don't respect copyright law, and they don't\r\nbelieve in your right to own property. Instead, they say that when you\r\n\"buy\" an ebook, you're really only *licensing* that book, and that\r\ncopyright law is superseded by the thousands of farcical, abusive\r\nwords in the license agreement you click through on the way to sealing\r\nthe deal. (Of course, the button on their website says, \"Buy this\r\nbook\" and they talk about \"Ebook sales\" at conferences -- no one says,\r\n\"License this book for your Kindle\" or \"Total licenses of ebooks are\r\nup from 0.00001% of all publishing to 0.0001% of all publishing, a\r\n100-fold increase!\")\r\n\r\nI say to hell with them. You bought it, you own it. I believe in\r\ncopyright law's guarantee of ownership in your books.\r\n\r\nSo you own this ebook. The license agreement (see below), is from\r\nCreative Commons and it gives you even *more* rights than you get to a\r\nregular book. Every word of it is a gift, not a confiscation. Enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhat do I want from you in return? Read the book. Tell your\r\nfriends. Review it on Amazon or at your local bookseller. Bring it to\r\nyour bookclub. Assign it to your students (older students, please --\r\nthat sex scene is a scorcher) (*now* I've got your attention, don't\r\nI?). As Woody Guthrie wrote:\r\n\r\n\"This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright #154085,\r\nfor a period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin' it without our\r\npermission, will be mighty good friends of ourn, cause we don't give a\r\ndern. Publish it. Write it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote\r\nit, that's all we wanted to do.\"\r\n\r\nOh yeah. Also: if you like it, buy it\r\n\r\nhttp://craphound.com/makers/buy\r\n\r\nor donate a copy to a worthy, cash-strapped institution.\r\n\r\nhttp://craphound.com/makers/donate\r\n\r\nWhy am I doing this? Because my problem isn't piracy, it's obscurity\r\n(thanks, @timoreilly for this awesome aphorism). Because free ebooks\r\nsell print books. Because I copied my ass off when I was 17 and grew\r\nup to spend practically every discretionary cent I have on books when\r\nI became an adult. Because I can't stop you from sharing it (zeroes\r\nand ones aren't ever going to get harder to copy); and because readers\r\nhave shared the books they loved forever; so I might as well enlist\r\nyou to the cause.\r\n\r\nI have always dreamt of writing sf novels, since I was six years\r\nold. Now I do it. It is a goddamned dream come true, like growing up\r\nto be a cowboy or an astronaut, except that you don't get oppressed by\r\nranchers or stuck on the launchpad in an adult diaper for 28 hours at\r\na stretch. The idea that I'd get dyspeptic over people -- *readers*\r\ncelebrating what I write is goddamned *bizarre*\r\n\r\nSo, download this book.\r\n\r\nSome rules of the road:\r\n\r\nIt's kind of a tradition around here that my readers convert my ebooks\r\nto their favorite formats and send them to me here, and it's one that\r\nI love! If you've converted these files to another format, send them\r\nto me (doctorow@craphound.com, subject Makers Conversion) and I'll\r\nhost them, but before you do, make sure you read the following:\r\n\r\n* Only one conversion per format, first come, first serve. That means\r\n  that if someone's already converted the file to a Femellhebber 3000\r\n  document, that's the one you're going to find here. I just don't\r\n  know enough about esoteric readers to adjudicate disputes about what\r\n  the ideal format is for your favorite device.\r\n\r\n* Make sure include a link to the reader as well. When you send me an\r\n  ebook file, make sure that you include a link to the website for the\r\n  reader technology as well so that I can include it below.\r\n\r\n* No cover art. The text of this book is freely copyable, the cover,\r\n  not so much. The rights to it are controlled by my publisher, so\r\n  don't include it with your file.\r\n\r\n* No DRM. The Creative Commons license prohibits sharing the file with\r\n  \"DRM\" (sometimes called \"copy-protection\") on it, and that's fine by\r\n  me. Don't send me the book with DRM on it. If you're converting to a\r\n  format that has a DRM option, make sure it's switched off.\r\n\r\n$$$$\r\n\r\nA word to professors, librarians, and people who want to donate money\r\nto me\r\n\r\nEvery time I put a book online for free, I get emails from readers who\r\nwant to send me donations for the book. I appreciate their generous\r\nspirit, but I'm not interested in cash donations, because my\r\npublishers are really important to me. They contribute immeasurably to\r\nthe book, improving it, introducing it to audience I could never\r\nreach, helping me do more with my work. I have no desire to cut them\r\nout of the loop.\r\n\r\nBut there has to be some good way to turn that generosity to good use,\r\nand I think I've found it.\r\n\r\nHere's the deal: there are lots of professors and librarians who'd\r\nlove to get hard-copies of this book into their students' and patrons'\r\nhands, but don't have the budget for it.\r\n\r\nThere are generous people who want to send some cash my way to thank\r\nme for the free ebooks.\r\n\r\nI'm proposing that we put them together.\r\n\r\nIf you're a prof or librarian and you want a free copy of Makers,\r\nemail freemakers@gmail.com with your name and the name and address of\r\nyour school. It'll be posted below by my fantastic helper, Olga Nunes,\r\nso that potential donors can see it.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the electronic edition of Makers and you want to donate\r\nsomething to say thanks, check below to find a teacher or librarian\r\nyou want to support. Then go to Amazon, BN.com, or your favorite\r\nelectronic bookseller and order a copy to the classroom, then email a\r\ncopy of the receipt (feel free to delete your address and other\r\npersonal info first!) to freemakers@gmail.com so that Olga can mark\r\nthat copy as sent. If you don't want to be publicly acknowledged for\r\nyour generosity, let us know and we'll keep you anonymous, otherwise\r\nwe'll thank you on the donate page.\r\n\r\nCheck http://craphound.com/makers/donate for profs, librarians and\r\nsimilar people seeking donations.\r\n\r\n$$$$\r\n\r\nThis file is licensed under a Creative Commons US\r\nAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license:\r\n\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\r\n\r\nYou are free:\r\n\r\n\t* to Share - to copy, distribute and transmit the work\r\n    \r\n\t* to Remix - to adapt the work\r\n\r\nUnder the following conditions:\r\n\r\n\t* Attribution - You must attribute the work in the manner\r\n          specified by the author or licensor (but not in any way that\r\n          suggests that they endorse you or your use of the work).\r\n\r\n\t* Noncommercial - You may not use this work for commercial\r\n          purposes.\r\n\r\n\t* Share Alike - If you alter, transform, or build upon this\r\n          work, you may distribute the resulting work only under the\r\n          same or similar license to this one.\r\n\r\nWith the understanding that:\r\n\r\n\t* Waiver - Any of the above conditions can be waived if you\r\n          get permission from the copyright holder.\r\n\t\r\n\t* Other Rights - In no way are any of the following rights\r\n          affected by the license:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t* Your fair dealing or fair use rights;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t* The author's moral rights;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t* Rights other persons may have either in the work\r\n                  itself or in how the work is used, such as publicity\r\n                  or privacy rights.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t* Notice - For any reuse or distribution, you must\r\n                  make clear to others the license terms of this work.\r\n\r\n$$$$\r\n\r\nDedication:\r\n\r\nFor \"the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things.\"\r\n\r\n$$$$\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nSuzanne Church almost never had to bother with the blue blazer these\r\ndays. Back at the height of the dot-boom, she'd put on her business\r\njournalist drag -- blazer, blue sailcloth shirt, khaki trousers,\r\nloafers -- just about every day, putting in her obligatory appearances\r\nat splashy press-conferences for high-flying IPOs and mergers. These\r\ndays, it was mostly work at home or one day a week at the San Jose\r\nMercury News's office, in comfortable light sweaters with loose necks\r\nand loose cotton pants that she could wear straight to yoga after\r\nshutting her computer's lid.\r\n\r\nBlue blazer today, and she wasn't the only one. There was Reedy from\r\nthe NYT's Silicon Valley office, and Tribbey from the WSJ, and that\r\ndespicable rat-toothed jumped-up gossip columnist from one of the UK\r\ntech-rags, and many others besides. Old home week, blue blazers fresh\r\nfrom the dry-cleaning bags that had guarded them since the last time\r\nthe NASDAQ broke 5,000.\r\n\r\nThe man of the hour was Landon Kettlewell -- the kind of outlandish\r\nprep-school name that always seemed a little made up to her -- the new\r\nCEO and front for the majority owners of Kodak/Duracell. The\r\ndespicable Brit had already started calling them Kodacell. Buying the\r\ncompany was pure Kettlewell: shrewd, weird, and ethical in a twisted\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\"Why the hell have you done this, Landon?\" Kettlewell asked himself\r\ninto his tie-mic. Ties and suits for the new Kodacell execs in the\r\nroom, like surfers playing dress-up. \"Why buy two dinosaurs and stick\r\n'em together? Will they mate and give birth to a new generation of\r\nless-endangered dinosaurs?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and walked to a different part of the stage,\r\nthumbing a PowerPoint remote that advanced his slide on the jumbotron\r\nto a picture of a couple of unhappy cartoon brontos staring desolately\r\nat an empty nest. \"Probably not. But there is a good case for what\r\nwe've just done, and with your indulgence, I'm going to lay it out for\r\nyou now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's hope he sticks to the cartoons,\" Rat-Toothed hissed beside\r\nher. His breath smelled like he'd been gargling turds. He had a\r\nnot-so-secret crush on her and liked to demonstrate his alpha-maleness\r\nby making half-witticisms into her ear. \"They're about his speed.\"\r\n\r\nShe twisted in her seat and pointedly hunched over her computer's\r\nscreen, to which she'd taped a thin sheet of polarized plastic that\r\nmade it opaque to anyone shoulder-surfing her. Being a halfway\r\nattractive woman in Silicon Valley was more of a pain in the ass than\r\nshe'd expected, back when she'd been covering rustbelt shenanigans in\r\nDetroit, back when there was an auto industry in Detroit.\r\n\r\nThe worst part was that the Brit's reportage was just spleen-filled\r\neditorializing on the lack of ethics in the valley's board-rooms (a\r\nfavorite subject of hers, which no doubt accounted for his\r\nfellow-feeling), and it was also the crux of Kettlewell's schtick. The\r\nspectacle of an exec who talked ethics enraged Rat-Toothed more than\r\nthe vilest baby-killers. He was the kind of revolutionary who liked\r\nhis firing squads arranged in a circle.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not that dumb, folks,\" Kettlewell said, provoking a stagey laugh\r\nfrom Mr Rat-Tooth. \"Here's the thing: the market had valued these\r\ncompanies at less than their cash on hand. They have twenty billion in\r\nthe bank and a 16 billion dollar market-cap. We just made four billion\r\ndollars, just by buying up the stock and taking control of the\r\ncompany. We could shut the doors, stick the money in our pockets, and\r\nretire.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne took notes. She knew all this, but Kettlewell gave good\r\nsound-bite, and talked slow in deference to the kind of reporter who\r\npreferred a notebook to a recorder. \"But we're not gonna do that.\" He\r\nhunkered down on his haunches at the edge of the stage, letting his\r\ntie dangle, staring spacily at the journalists and analysts. \"Kodacell\r\nis bigger than that.\" He'd read his email that morning then, and seen\r\nRat-Toothed's new moniker. \"Kodacell has goodwill. It has\r\ninfrastructure. Administrators. Physical plant. Supplier\r\nrelationships. Distribution and logistics. These companies have a lot\r\nof useful plumbing and a lot of priceless reputation.\r\n\r\n\"What we don't have is a product. There aren't enough buyers for\r\nbatteries or film -- or any of the other stuff we make -- to occupy or\r\nsupport all that infrastructure. These companies slept through the\r\ndot-boom and the dot-bust, trundling along as though none of it\r\nmattered. There are parts of these businesses that haven't changed\r\nsince the fifties.\r\n\r\n\"We're not the only ones. Technology has challenged and killed\r\nbusinesses from every sector. Hell, IBM *doesn't make computers\r\nanymore*! The very idea of a travel agent is inconceivably weird\r\ntoday! And the record labels, oy, the poor, crazy, suicidal, stupid\r\nrecord labels. Don't get me started.\r\n\r\n\"Capitalism is eating itself. The market works, and when it works, it\r\ncommodifies or obsoletes everything. That's not to say that there's no\r\nmoney out there to be had, but the money won't come from a single,\r\nmonolithic product line. The days of companies with names like\r\n'General Electric' and 'General Mills' and 'General Motors' are\r\nover. The money on the table is like krill: a billion little\r\nentrepreneurial opportunities that can be discovered and exploited by\r\nsmart, creative people.\r\n\r\n\"We will brute-force the problem-space of capitalism in the twenty\r\nfirst century. Our business plan is simple: we will hire the smartest\r\npeople we can find and put them in small teams. They will go into the\r\nfield with funding and communications infrastructure -- all that stuff\r\nwe have left over from the era of batteries and film -- behind them,\r\ncapitalized to find a place to live and work, and a job to do. A\r\nbusiness to start. Our company isn't a project that we pull together\r\non, it's a *network* of like-minded, cooperating autonomous teams, all\r\nof which are empowered to do whatever they want, provided that it\r\nreturns something to our coffers. We will explore and exhaust the\r\nrealm of commercial opportunities, and seek constantly to refine our\r\ntactics to mine those opportunities, and fill our hungry belly. This\r\ncompany isn't a company anymore: this company is a network, an\r\napproach, a sensibility.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne's fingers clattered over her keyboard. The Brit chuckled\r\nnastily. \"Nice talk, considering he just made a hundred thousand\r\npeople redundant,\" he said. Suzanne tried to shut him out: yes,\r\nKettlewell was firing a company's worth of people, but he was also\r\nsaving the company itself. The prospectus had a decent severance for\r\nall those departing workers, and the ones who'd taken advantage of the\r\ncompany stock-buying plan would find their pensions augmented by\r\nwhatever this new scheme could rake in. If it worked.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Kettlewell?\" Rat-Toothed had clambered to his hind legs.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Freddy?\" Freddy was Rat-Toothed's given name, though Suzanne was\r\nhard pressed to ever retain it for more than a few minutes at a\r\ntime. Kettlewell knew every business-journalist in the Valley by name,\r\nthough. It was a CEO thing.\r\n\r\n\"Where will you recruit this new workforce from? And what kind of\r\nentrepreneurial things will they be doing to 'exhaust the realm of\r\ncommercial activities'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Freddy, we don't have to recruit anyone. They're beating a path to\r\nour door. *This* is a nation of manic entrepreneurs, the kind of\r\npeople who've been inventing businesses from video arcades to\r\nphotomats for centuries.\" Freddy scowled skeptically, his jumble of\r\ngrey tombstone teeth protruding. \"Come on, Freddy, you ever hear of\r\nthe Grameen Bank?\"\r\n\r\nFreddy nodded slowly. \"In India, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bangladesh. Bankers travel from village to village on foot and by\r\nbus, finding small co-ops who need tiny amounts of credit to buy a\r\ncellphone or a goat or a loom in order to grow. The bankers make the\r\nloans and advise the entrepreneurs, and the payback rate is fifty\r\ntimes higher than the rate at a regular lending institution. They\r\ndon't even have a written lending agreement: entrepreneurs -- real,\r\nhard-working entrepreneurs -- you can trust on a handshake.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going to help Americans who lost their jobs in your factories\r\nbuy goats and cellphones?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're going to give them loans and coordination to start businesses\r\nthat use information, materials science, commodified software and\r\nhardware designs, and creativity to wring a profit from the air around\r\nus. Here, catch!\" He dug into his suit-jacket and flung a small object\r\ntoward Freddy, who fumbled it. It fell onto Suzanne's keyboard.\r\n\r\nShe picked it up. It looked like a keychain laser-pointer, or maybe a\r\nnovelty light-saber.\r\n\r\n\"Switch it on, Suzanne, please, and shine it, oh, on that wall there.\"\r\nKettlewell pointed at the upholstered retractable wall that divided\r\nthe hotel ballroom into two functional spaces.\r\n\r\nSuzanne twisted the end and pointed it. A crisp rectangle of green\r\nlaser-light lit up the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Now, watch this,\" Kettlewell said.\r\n\r\nNOW WATCH THIS\r\n\r\nThe words materialized in the middle of the rectangle on the distant\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n\"Testing one two three,\" Kettlewell said.\r\n\r\nTESTING ONE TWO THREE\r\n\r\n\"Donde esta el bano?\"\r\n\r\nWHERE IS THE BATHROOM\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said Suzanne. Her hand wobbled a little and the distant\r\nletters danced.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS IT\r\n\r\n\"This is a new artifact designed and executed by five previously\r\nout-of-work engineers in Athens, Georgia. They've mated a tiny Linux\r\nbox with some speaker-independent continuous speech recognition\r\nsoftware, a free software translation engine that can translate\r\nbetween any of twelve languages, and an extremely high-resolution LCD\r\nthat blocks out words in the path of the laser-pointer.\r\n\r\n\"Turn this on, point it at a wall, and start talking. Everything said\r\nshows up on the wall, in the language of your choosing, regardless of\r\nwhat language the speaker was speaking.\"\r\n\r\nAll the while, Kettlewell's words were scrolling by in black block\r\ncaps on that distant wall: crisp, laser-edged letters.\r\n\r\n\"This thing wasn't invented. All the parts necessary to make this go\r\nwere just lying around. It was *assembled*. A gal in a garage, her\r\nbrother the marketing guy, her husband overseeing manufacturing in\r\nBelgrade. They needed a couple grand to get it all going, and they'll\r\nneed some life-support while they find their natural market.\r\n\r\n\"They got twenty grand from Kodacell this week. Half of it a loan,\r\nhalf of it equity. And we put them on the payroll, with\r\nbenefits. They're part freelancer, part employee, in a team with\r\nbacking and advice from across the whole business.\r\n\r\n\"It was easy to do once. We're going to do it ten thousand times this\r\nyear. We're sending out talent scouts, like the artists and\r\nrepresentation people the record labels used to use, and they're going\r\nto sign up a lot of these bands for us, and help them to cut records,\r\nto start businesses that push out to the edges of business.\r\n\r\n\"So, Freddy, to answer your question, no, we're not giving them loans\r\nto buy cellphones and goats.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell beamed. Suzanne twisted the laser-pointer off and made\r\nready to toss it back to the stage, but Kettlewell waved her off.\r\n\r\n\"Keep it,\" he said. It was suddenly odd to hear him speak without the\r\ntext crawl on that distant wall. She put the laser pointer in her\r\npocket and reflected that it had the authentic feel of cool,\r\ndisposable technology: the kind of thing on its way from a startup's\r\ndistant supplier to the schwag bags at high-end technology conferences\r\nto blister-packs of six hanging in the impulse aisle at Fry's.\r\n\r\nShe tried to imagine the technology conferences she'd been to with the\r\naddition of the subtitling and translation and couldn't do it. Not\r\nconferences. Something else. A kids' toy? A tool for\r\nStarbucks-smashing anti-globalists, planning strategy before a WTO\r\nriot? She patted her pocket.\r\n\r\nFreddy hissed and bubbled like a teakettle beside her, fuming. \"What a\r\ncock,\" he muttered. \"Thinks he's going to hire ten thousand teams to\r\nreplace his workforce, doesn't say a word about what *that* lot is\r\nmeant to be doing now he's shitcanned them all. Utter\r\nbullshit. Irrational exuberance gone berserk.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne had a perverse impulse to turn the wand back on and splash\r\nFreddy's bilious words across the ceiling, and the thought made her\r\ngiggle. She suppressed it and kept on piling up notes, thinking about\r\nthe structure of the story she'd file that day.\r\n\r\nKettlewell pulled out some charts and another surfer in a suit came\r\nforward to talk money, walking them through the financials. She'd read\r\nthem already and decided that they were a pretty credible bit of\r\nfiction, so she let her mind wander.\r\n\r\nShe was a hundred miles away when the ballroom doors burst open and\r\nthe unionized laborers of the former Kodak and the former Duracell\r\npoured in on them, tossing literature into the air so that it snowed\r\nangry leaflets. They had a big drum and a bugle, and they shook\r\ntambourines. The hotel rent-a-cops occasionally darted forward and\r\ngrabbed a protestor by the arm, but her colleagues would immediately\r\nswarm them and pry her loose and drag her back into the body of the\r\ndemonstration. Freddy grinned and shouted something at Kettlewell, but\r\nit was lost in the din. The journalists took a lot of pictures.\r\n\r\nSuzanne closed her computer's lid and snatched a leaflet out of the\r\nair. WHAT ABOUT US? it began, and talked about the workers who'd been\r\nat Kodak and Duracell for twenty, thirty, even forty years, who had\r\nbeen conspicuously absent from Kettlewell's stated plans to date.\r\n\r\nShe twisted the laser-pointer to life and pointed it back at the\r\nwall. Leaning in very close, she said, \"What are your plans for your\r\nexisting workforce, Mr Kettlewell?\"\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR YOUR EXISTING WORKFORCE MR KETTLEWELL\r\n\r\nShe repeated the question several times, refreshing the text so that\r\nit scrolled like a stock ticker across that upholstered wall, an\r\nilluminated focus that gradually drew all the attention in the\r\nroom. The protestors saw it and began to laugh, then they read it\r\naloud in ragged unison, until it became a chant: WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS\r\n-- *thump* of the big drum -- FOR YOUR EXISTING WORKFORCE *thump* MR\r\n*thump* KETTLEWELL?\r\n\r\nSuzanne felt her cheeks warm. Kettlewell was looking at her with\r\nsomething like a smile. She liked him, but that was a personal thing\r\nand this was a truth thing. She was a little embarrassed that she had\r\nlet him finish his spiel without calling him on that obvious\r\nquestion. She felt tricked, somehow. Well, she was making up for it\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nOn the stage, the surfer-boys in suits were confabbing, holding their\r\nthumbs over their tie-mics. Finally, Kettlewell stepped up and held up\r\nhis own laser-pointer, painting another rectangle of light beside\r\nSuzanne's.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you asked that, Suzanne,\" he said, his voice barely audible.\r\n\r\nI'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT SUZANNE\r\n\r\nThe journalists chuckled. Even the chanters laughed a little. They\r\nquieted down.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you, there's a downside to living in this age of wonders:\r\nwe are moving too fast and outstripping the ability of our\r\ninstitutions to keep pace with the changes in the world.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy leaned over her shoulder, blowing shit-breath in her\r\near. \"Translation: you're ass-fucked, the lot of you.\"\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION YOUR ASS FUCKED THE LOT OF YOU\r\n\r\nSuzanne yelped as the words appeared on the wall and reflexively swung\r\nthe pointer around, painting them on the ceiling, the opposite wall,\r\nand then, finally, in miniature, on her computer's lid. She twisted\r\nthe pointer off.\r\n\r\n Freddy had the decency to look slightly embarrassed and he slunk away\r\n to the very end of the row of seats, scooting from chair to chair on\r\n his narrow butt. On stage, Kettlewell was pretending very hard that\r\n he hadn't seen the profanity, and that he couldn't hear the jeering\r\n from the protestors now, even though it had grown so loud that he\r\n could no longer be heard over it. He kept on talking, and the words\r\n scrolled over the far wall.\r\n\r\nTHERE IS NO WORLD IN WHICH KODAK AND DURACELL GO ON MAKING FILM AND\r\nBATTERIES\r\n\r\nTHE COMPANIES HAVE MONEY IN THE BANK BUT IT HEMORRHAGES OUT THE DOOR\r\nEVERY DAY\r\n\r\nWE ARE MAKING THINGS THAT NO ONE WANTS TO BUY\r\n\r\nTHIS PLAN INCLUDES A GENEROUS SEVERANCE FOR THOSE STAFFERS WORKING IN\r\nTHE PARTS OF THE BUSINESS THAT WILL CLOSE DOWN\r\n\r\n-- Suzanne admired the twisted, long-way-around way of saying, \"the\r\n   people we're firing.\" Pure CEO passive voice. She couldn't type\r\n   notes and read off the wall at the same time. She whipped out her\r\n   little snapshot and monkeyed with it until it was in video mode and\r\n   then started shooting the ticker.\r\n\r\nBUT IF WE ARE TO MAKE GOOD ON THAT SEVERANCE WE NEED TO BE IN BUSINESS\r\n\r\nWE NEED TO BE BRINGING IN A PROFIT SO THAT WE CAN MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS\r\nTO ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS SHAREHOLDERS AND WORKFORCE ALIKE\r\n\r\nWE CAN'T PAY A PENNY IN SEVERANCE IF WE'RE BANKRUPT\r\n\r\nWE ARE HIRING 50000 NEW EMPLOYEES THIS YEAR AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT\r\nSAYS THAT THOSE NEW PEOPLE CAN'T COME FROM WITHIN\r\n\r\nCURRENT EMPLOYEES WILL BE GIVEN CONSIDERATION BY OUR SCOUTS\r\n\r\nENTREPRENEURSHIP IS A DEEPLY AMERICAN PRACTICE AND OUR WORKERS ARE AS\r\nCAPABLE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTION AS ANYONE\r\n\r\nI AM CONFIDENT WE WILL FIND MANY OF OUR NEW HIRES FROM WITHIN OUR\r\nEXISTING WORKFORCE\r\n\r\nI SAY THIS TO OUR EMPLOYEES IF YOU HAVE EVER DREAMED OF STRIKING OUT\r\nON YOUR OWN EXECUTING ON SOME AMAZING IDEA AND NEVER FOUND THE MEANS\r\nTO DO IT NOW IS THE TIME AND WE ARE THE PEOPLE TO HELP\r\n\r\nSuzanne couldn't help but admire the pluck it took to keep speaking\r\ninto the pointer, despite the howls and bangs.\r\n\r\n\"C'mon, I'm gonna grab some bagels before the protestors get to them,\"\r\nFreddy said, plucking at her arm -- apparently, this was his version\r\nof a charming pickup line. She shook him off authoritatively, with a\r\nwhip-crack of her elbow.\r\n\r\nFreddy stood there for a minute and then moved off. She waited to see\r\nif Kettlewell would say anything more, but he twisted the pointer off,\r\nshrugged, and waved at the hooting protestors and the analysts and the\r\njournalists and walked off-stage with the rest of the surfers in\r\nsuits.\r\n\r\nShe got some comments from a few of the protestors, some\r\ndetails. Worked for Kodak or Duracell all their lives. Gave everything\r\nto the company. Took voluntary pay-cuts under the old management five\r\ntimes in ten years to keep the business afloat, now facing layoffs as\r\na big fat thank-you-suckers. So many kids. Such and such a mortgage.\r\n\r\nShe knew these stories from Detroit: she'd filed enough copy with\r\nvarying renditions of it to last a lifetime. Silicon Valley was\r\nsupposed to be different. Growth and entrepreneurship -- a failed\r\ncompany was just a stepping-stone to a successful one, can't win them\r\nall, dust yourself off and get back to the garage and start\r\ninventing. There's a whole world waiting out there!\r\n\r\nMother of three. Dad whose bright daughter's university fund was\r\nraided to make ends meet during the \"temporary\" austerity\r\nmeasures. This one has a Down's Syndrome kid and that one worked\r\nthrough three back surgeries to help meet production deadlines.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour before she'd been full of that old Silicon Valley\r\noptimism, the sense that there was a better world a-borning around\r\nher. Now she was back in that old rustbelt funk, with the feeling that\r\nshe was witness not to a beginning, but to a perpetual ending, a cycle\r\nof destruction that would tear down everything solid and reliable in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nShe packed up her laptop and stepped out into the parking lot. Across\r\nthe freeway, she could make out the bones of the Great America\r\nfun-park roller-coasters whipping around and around in the warm\r\nCalifornia sun.\r\n\r\nThese little tech-hamlets down the 101 were deceptively utopian. All\r\nthe homeless people were miles north on the streets of San Francisco,\r\nwhere pedestrian marks for panhandling could be had, where the crack\r\nwas sold on corners instead of out of the trunks of fresh-faced,\r\nfriendly coke-dealers' cars. Down here it was giant malls,\r\npurpose-built dot-com buildings, and the occasional fun-park. Palo\r\nAlto was a university-town theme-park, provided you steered clear of\r\nthe wrong side of the tracks, the East Palo Alto slums that were\r\npractically shanties.\r\n\r\nChrist, she was getting melancholy. She didn't want to go into the\r\noffice -- not today. Not when she was in this kind of mood. She would\r\ngo home and put her blazer back in the closet and change into yoga\r\ntogs and write her column and have some good coffee.\r\n\r\nShe nailed up the copy in an hour and emailed it to her editor and\r\npoured herself a glass of Napa red (the local vintages in Michigan\r\nlikewise left something to be desired) and settled onto her porch,\r\noverlooking the big reservoir off 280 near San Mateo.\r\n\r\nThe house had been worth a small fortune at the start of the dot-boom,\r\nbut now, in the resurgent property boom, it was worth a large fortune\r\nand then some. She could conceivably sell this badly built little\r\nshack with its leaky hot-tub for enough money to retire on, if she\r\nwanted to live out the rest of her days in Sri Lanka or Nebraska.\r\n\r\n\"You've got no business feeling poorly, young lady,\" she said to\r\nherself. \"You are as well set-up as you could have dreamed, and you\r\nare right in the thick of the weirdest and best time the world has yet\r\nseen. And Landon Kettlewell knows your name.\"\r\n\r\nShe finished the wine and opened her computer. It was dark enough now\r\nwith the sun set behind the hills that she could read the screen. The\r\nWeb was full of interesting things, her email full of challenging\r\nnotes from her readers, and her editor had already signed off on her\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\nShe was getting ready to shut the lid and head for bed, so she pulled\r\nher mail once more.\r\n\r\nFrom: kettlewell-l@skunkworks.kodacell.com\r\n\r\nTo: schurch@sjmercury.com\r\n\r\nSubject: Embedded journalist?\r\n\r\nThanks for keeping me honest today, Suzanne. It's the hardest question\r\nwe're facing today: what happens when all the things you're good at\r\nare no good to anyone anymore? I hope we're going to answer that with\r\nthe new model.\r\n\r\nYou do good work, madam. I'd be honored if you'd consider joining one\r\nof our little teams for a couple months and chronicling what they\r\ndo. I feel like we're making history here and we need someone to\r\nchronicle it.\r\n\r\nI don't know if you can square this with the Merc, and I suppose that\r\nwe should be doing this through my PR people and your editor, but\r\nthere comes a time about this time every night when I'm just too\r\ngoddamned hyper to bother with all that stuff and I want to just DO\r\nSOMETHING instead of ask someone else to start a process to\r\ninvestigate the possibility of someday possibly maybe doing something.\r\n\r\nWill you do something with us, if we can make it work? 100 percent\r\naccess, no oversight? Say you will. Please.\r\n\r\nYour pal,\r\n\r\nKettlebelly\r\n\r\nShe stared at her screen. It was like a work of art; just look at that\r\nreturn address, \"kettlewell-l@skunkworks.kodacell.com\" -- for\r\nkodacell.com to be live and accepting mail, it had to have been\r\nregistered the day before. She had a vision of Kettlewell checking his\r\nemail at midnight before his big press-conference, catching Freddy's\r\ncolumn, and registering kodacell.com on the spot, then waking up some\r\nsysadmin to get a mail server answering at\r\nskunkworks.kodacell.com. Last she'd heard, Lockheed-Martin was\r\nthreatening to sue anyone who used their trademarked term \"Skunk\r\nWorks\" to describe a generic R&D department. That meant that\r\nKettlewell had moved so fast that he hadn't even run this project by\r\nlegal. She was willing to bet that he'd already ordered new\r\nbusiness-cards with the address on them.\r\n\r\nThere was a guy she knew, an editor at a mag who'd assigned himself a\r\nplum article that he'd run on his own cover. He'd gotten a book-deal\r\nout of it. A half-million dollar book-deal. If Kettlewell was right,\r\nthen the exclusive book on the inside of the first year at Kodacell\r\ncould easily make that advance. And the props would be mad, as the\r\nkids said.\r\n\r\nKettlebelly! It was such a stupid frat-boy nickname, but it made her\r\nsmile. He wasn't taking himself seriously, or maybe he was, but he\r\nwasn't being a pompous ass about it. He was serious about changing the\r\nworld and frivolous about everything else. She'd have a hard time\r\nbeing an objective reporter if she said yes to this.\r\n\r\nShe couldn't possibly decide at this hour. She needed a night's sleep\r\nand she had to talk this over with the Merc. If she had a boyfriend,\r\nshe'd have to talk it over with him, but that wasn't a problem in her\r\nlife these days.\r\n\r\nShe spread on some expensive duty-free French wrinkle-cream and\r\nbrushed her teeth and put on her nightie and double-checked the door\r\nlocks and did all the normal things she did of an evening. Then she\r\nfolded back her sheets, plumped her pillows and stared at them.\r\n\r\nShe turned on her heel and stalked back to her computer and thumped\r\nthe spacebar until the thing woke from sleep.\r\n\r\nFrom: schurch@sjmercury.com\r\n\r\nTo: kettlewell-l@skunkworks.kodacell.com\r\n\r\nSubject: Re: Embedded journalist?\r\n\r\nKettlebelly: that is one dumb nickname. I couldn't possibly associate\r\nmyself with a grown man who calls himself Kettlebelly.\r\n\r\nSo stop calling yourself Kettlebelly, immediately. If you can do that,\r\nwe've got a deal.\r\n\r\nSuzanne\r\n\r\nThere had come a day when her readers acquired email and the paper ran\r\nher address with her byline, and her readers had begun to write her\r\nand write her and write her. Some were amazing, informative,\r\nthoughtful notes. Some were the vilest, most bilious trolling. In\r\norder to deal with these notes, she had taught herself to pause,\r\nbreathe, and re-read any email message before clicking send.\r\n\r\nThe reflex kicked in now and she re-read her note to Kettlebelly --\r\nKettlewell! -- and felt a crimp in her guts. Then she hit send.\r\n\r\nShe needed to pee, and apparently had done for some time, without\r\nrealizing it. She was on the toilet when she heard the ping of new\r\nincoming mail.\r\n\r\nFrom: kettlewell-l@skunkworks.kodacell.com\r\n\r\nTo: schurch@sjmercury.com\r\n\r\nSubject: Re: Embedded journalist?\r\n\r\nI will never call myself Kettlebelly again.\r\n\r\nYour pal,\r\n\r\nKettledrum.\r\n\r\nOh-shit-oh-shit-oh-shit. She did a little two-step at her bed's\r\nedge. Tomorrow she'd go see her editor about this, but it just felt\r\n*right*, and exciting, like she was on the brink of an event that\r\nwould change her life forever.\r\n\r\nIt took her three hours of mindless Web-surfing, including a truly\r\ndreary Hot-Or-Not clicktrance and an hour's worth of fiddling with\r\ntweets from the press-conference, before she was able to lull herself\r\nto sleep. As she nodded off, she thought that Kettlewell's insomnia\r\nwas as contagious as his excitement.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nHollywood, Florida's biggest junkyard was situated in the rubble of a\r\nhalf-built ghost-mall off Taft Street. Suzanne's Miami airport rental\r\ncar came with a GPS, but the little box hadn't ever heard of the mall;\r\nit was off the map. So she took a moment in the sweltering parking-lot\r\nof her coffin hotel to call her interview subject again and get better\r\ncoordinates.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, it's 'cause they never finished building the mall, so the\r\naddress hasn't been included in the USGS maps. The open GPSes all have\r\nthese better maps made by geohackers, but the rental car companies\r\nhave got a real hard-on for official map-data. Morons. Hang on, lemme\r\nget my GPS out and I'll get you some decent lat-long.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice had a pleasant, youthful, midwestern sound, like a Canadian\r\nnewscaster: friendly and enthusiastic as a puppy. His name was Perry\r\nGibbons, and if Kettlewell was to be believed, he was the most\r\npromising prospect identified by Kodacell's talent-scouts.\r\n\r\nThe ghost-mall was just one of many along Taft Street, ranging in size\r\nfrom little corner plazas to gigantic palaces with broken-in atria and\r\ncracked parking lots. A lot of the malls in California had crashed,\r\nbut they'd been turned into flea-markets or day-cares, or, if they'd\r\nbeen abandoned, they hadn't been abandoned like this, left to go to\r\nruin. This reminded her of Detroit before she'd left, whole swaths of\r\nthe inner city emptied of people, neighborhoods condemned and\r\nbulldozed and, in a couple of weird cases, actually *farmed* by\r\nenterprising city-dwellers who planted crops, kept livestock, and rode\r\ntheir mini tractors beneath the beam of the defunct white-elephant\r\nmonorail.\r\n\r\nThe other commonality this stretch of road shared with Detroit was the\r\nobesity of the people she passed. She'd felt a little self-conscious\r\nthat morning, dressing in a light short-sleeved blouse and a pair of\r\nshorts -- nothing else would do, the weather was so hot and drippy\r\nthat even closed-toe shoes would have been intolerable. At 45, her\r\nlegs had slight cellulite saddlebags and her tummy wasn't the\r\nwashboard it had been when she was 25. But here, on this stretch of\r\nroad populated by people so fat they could barely walk, so fat that\r\nthey were de-sexed marshmallows with faces like inflatable toys, she\r\nfelt like a toothpick.\r\n\r\nThe GPS queeped when she came up on the junkyard, a sprawling,\r\nhalf-built discount mall whose waist-high walls had been used to\r\nparcel out different kinds of sorted waste. The mall had been planned\r\nwith wide indoor boulevards between the shops wide enough for two\r\nlanes of traffic, and she cruised those lanes now in the hertzmobile,\r\nlooking for a human. Once she reached the center of the mall -- a dry\r\nfountain filled with dusty Christmas-tree ornaments -- she stopped and\r\nleaned on the horn.\r\n\r\nShe got out of the car and called, \"Hello? Perry?\" She could have\r\nphoned him but it always seemed so wasteful spending money on airtime\r\nwhen you were trying to talk to someone within shouting range.\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne!\" The voice came from her left. She shielded her eyes from\r\nthe sun's glare and peered down a spoke of mall-lane and caught her\r\nfirst glimpse of Perry Gibbons. He was standing in the basket of a\r\ntall cherry-picker, barechested and brown. He wore a sun-visor and big\r\nwork gloves, and big, baggy shorts whose pockets jangled as he\r\nshinnied down the crane's neck.\r\n\r\nShe started toward him tentatively. Not a lot of business-reporting\r\nassignments involved spending time with half-naked, sun-baked dudes in\r\nremote southern junkyards. Still, he sounded nice.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" she called. He was young, 22 or 23, and already had\r\nsquint-creases at the corners of his eyes. He had a brace on one wrist\r\nand his steel-toed boots were the mottled grey of a grease-puddle on\r\nthe floor of a muffler and brake shop.\r\n\r\nHe grinned and tugged off a glove, stuck out his hand. \"A\r\npleasure. Sorry for the trouble finding this place. It's not easy to\r\nget to, but it's cheap as hell.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it.\" She looked around again -- the heaps of interesting\r\ntrash, the fountain-dish filled with thousands of shining\r\nornaments. The smell was a mixture of machine-oil and salt, jungle\r\nair, Florida swamp and Detroit steel. \"So, this place is pretty\r\ncool. Looks like you've got pretty much everything you could imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then some.\" This was spoken by another man, one who puffed\r\nheavily up from behind her. He was enormous, not just tall but fat, as\r\nbig around as a barrel. His green tee-shirt read IT'S FUN TO USE\r\nLEARNING FOR EVIL! in blocky, pixelated letters. He took her hand and\r\nshook it. \"I love your blog,\" he said. \"I read it all the time.\" He\r\nhad three chins, and eyes that were nearly lost in his apple cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Meet Lester,\" Perry said. \"My partner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sidekick,\" Lester said with a huge wink. \"Sysadmin slash hardware\r\nhacker slash dogsbody slashdot org.\"\r\n\r\nShe chuckled. Nerd humor. Ar ar ar.\r\n\r\n\"Right, let's get started. You wanna see what I do, right?\" Perry\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Suzanne said.\r\n\r\n\"Lead the way, Lester,\" Perry said, and gestured with an arm, deep\r\ninto the center of the junkpile. \"All right, check this stuff out as\r\nwe go.\" He stuck his hand through the unglazed window of a never-built\r\nshop and plucked out a toy in a battered box. \"I love these things,\"\r\nhe said, handing it to her.\r\n\r\nShe took it. It was a Sesame Street Elmo doll, labeled BOOGIE WOOGIE\r\nELMO.\r\n\r\n\"That's from the great Elmo Crash,\" Perry said, taking back the box\r\nand expertly extracting the Elmo like he was shelling a nut. \"The last\r\nand greatest generation of Elmoid technology, cast into an uncaring\r\nworld that bought millions of Li'l Tagger washable graffiti kits\r\ninstead after Rosie gave them two thumbs up on her Christmas shopping\r\nguide.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Elmo was an orphan, and every junkyard in the world has\r\nmountains of mint-in-package BWEs, getting rained on, waiting to start\r\ntheir long, half-million-year decomposition.\r\n\r\n\"But check this out.\" He flicked a multitool off his belt and\r\nextracted a short, sharp scalpel-blade. He slit the grinning,\r\ndisco-suited Elmo open from chin to groin and shucked its furry\r\nexterior and the foam tissue that overlaid its skeleton. He slid the\r\nblade under the plastic cover on its ass and revealed a little printed\r\ncircuit board.\r\n\r\n\"That's an entire Atom processor on a chip, there,\" he said. \"Each\r\nlimb and the head have their own subcontrollers. There's a\r\nhigh-powered digital-to-analog rig for letting him sing and dance to\r\nnew songs, and an analog-to-digital converter array for converting\r\nspoken and danced commands to motions. Basically, you dance and sing\r\nfor Elmo and he'll dance and sing back for you.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne nodded. She'd missed that toy, which was a pity. She had a\r\nfive year old goddaughter in Minneapolis who would have loved a Boogie\r\nWoogie Elmo.\r\n\r\nThey had come to a giant barn, set at the edge of a story-and-a-half's\r\nworth of anchor store. \"This used to be where the contractors kept\r\ntheir heavy equipment,\" Lester rumbled, aiming a car-door remote at\r\nthe door, which queeped and opened.\r\n\r\nInside, it was cool and bright, the chugging air-conditioners\r\nefficiently blasting purified air over the many work-surfaces. The\r\nbarn was a good 25 feet tall, with a loft and a catwalk circling it\r\nhalfway up. It was lined with metallic shelves stacked neatly with\r\nlabeled boxes of parts scrounged from the junkyard.\r\n\r\nPerry set Elmo down on a workbench and worked a miniature USB cable\r\ninto his chest-cavity. The other end terminated with a PDA with a\r\nsmall rubberized photovoltaic cell on the front.\r\n\r\n\"This thing is running InstallParty -- it can recognize any hardware\r\nand build and install a Linux distro on it without human\r\nintervention. They used a ton of different suppliers for the BWE, so\r\nevery one is a little different, depending on who was offering the\r\ncheapest parts the day it was built. InstallParty doesn't care,\r\nthough: one-click and away it goes.\" The PDA was doing all kinds of\r\nfunny dances on its screen, montages of playful photoshopping of\r\npublic figures matted into historical fine art.\r\n\r\n\"All done. Now, have a look -- this is a Linux computer with some of\r\nthe most advanced robotics ever engineered. No sweatshop stuff,\r\neither, see this? The solder is too precise to be done by hand --\r\nthat's because it's from India. If it was from Cambodia, you'd see all\r\nkinds of wobble in the solder: that means that tiny, clever hands were\r\nused to create it, which means that somewhere in the device's karmic\r\nhistory, there's a sweatshop full of crippled children inhaling solder\r\nfumes until they keel over and are dumped in a ditch. This is the good\r\nstuff.\r\n\r\n\"So we have this karmically clean robot with infinitely malleable\r\ncomputation and a bunch of robotic capabilities. I've turned these\r\nthings into wall-climbing monkeys; I've modded them for a woman from\r\nthe University of Miami at the Jackson Memorial who used their\r\ncapability to ape human motions in physiotherapy programs with\r\nnerve-damage cases. But the best thing I've done with them so far is\r\nthe Distributed Boogie Woogie Elmo Motor Vehicle Operation\r\nCluster. Come on,\" he said, and took off deeper into the barn's\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nThey came to a dusty, stripped-down Smart car, one of those tiny\r\ntwo-seat electric cars you could literally buy out of a vending\r\nmachine in Europe. It was barely recognizable, having been reduced to\r\nits roll-cage, drive-train and control-panel. A gang of naked robot\r\nElmos were piled into it.\r\n\r\n\"Wake up boys, time for a demo!\" Perry shouted, and they sat up and\r\nmade canned, tinny Elmo \"oh boy\" noises, climbing into position on the\r\npedals, around the wheel, and on the gear-tree.\r\n\r\n\"I got the idea when I was teaching an Elmo to play Mario Brothers. I\r\nthought it'd get a decent diggdotting. I could get it to speedrun all\r\nof the first level using an old paddle I'd found and rehabilitated,\r\nand I was trying to figure out what to do next. The dead mall across\r\nthe way is a drive-in theater, and I was out front watching the silent\r\nmovies, and one of them showed all these cute little furry animated\r\nwhatevers collectively driving a car. It's a really old sight-gag, I\r\nmean, like racial memory old. I'd seen the Little Rascals do the same\r\nbit, with Alfalfa on the wheel and Buckwheat and Spanky on the brake\r\nand clutch and the doggy working the gearshift.\r\n\r\n\"And I thought, Shit, I could do that with Elmos. They don't have any\r\nnetworking capability, but they can talk and they can parse spoken\r\ncommands, so all I need is to designate one for left and one for right\r\nand one for fast and one for slow and one to be the eyes, barking\r\norders and they should be able to do this. And it works! They even\r\nadjust their balance and centers of gravity when the car swerves to\r\nstay upright at their posts. Check it out.\" He turned to the\r\ncar. \"Driving Elmos, ten-HUT!\" They snapped upright and ticked salutes\r\noff their naked plastic noggins. \"In circles, DRIVE,\" he called. The\r\nElmos scrambled into position and fired up the car and in short order\r\nthey were doing donuts in the car's little indoor pasture.\r\n\r\n\"Elmos, HALT\" Perry shouted and the car stopped silently, rocking\r\ngently. \"Stand DOWN.\" The Elmos sat down with a series of tiny thumps.\r\n\r\nSuzanne found herself applauding. \"That was amazing,\" she\r\nsaid. \"Really impressive. So that's what you're going to do for\r\nKodacell, make these things out of recycled toys?\"\r\n\r\nLester chuckled. \"Nope, not quite. That's just for starters. The Elmos\r\nare all about the universal availability of cycles and\r\napparatus. Everywhere you look, there's devices for free that have\r\neverything you need to make anything do anything.\r\n\r\n\"But have a look at part two, c'mere.\" He lumbered off in another\r\ndirection, and Suzanne and Perry trailed along behind him.\r\n\r\n\"This is Lester's workshop,\" Perry said, as they passed through a set\r\nof swinging double doors and into a cluttered wonderland. Where\r\nPerry's domain had been clean and neatly organized, Lester's area was\r\na happy shambles. His shelves weren't orderly, but rather, crammed\r\nwith looming piles of amazing junk: thrift-store wedding dresses,\r\nplaster statues of bowling monkeys, box kites, knee-high tin\r\nknights-in-armor, seashells painted with American flags, presidential\r\naction-figures, paste jewelry and antique cough-drop tins.\r\n\r\n\"You know how they say a sculptor starts with a block of marble and\r\nchips away everything that doesn't look like a statue? Like he can\r\n*see* the statue in the block? I get like that with garbage: I see the\r\npieces on the heaps and in roadside trash and I can just *see* how it\r\ncan go together, like this.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached down below a work-table and hoisted up a huge triptych made\r\nout of three hinged car-doors stood on end. Carefully, he unfolded it\r\nand stood it like a screen on the cracked concrete floor.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the car-doors had been stripped clean and polished to a\r\nhigh metal gleam that glowed like sterling silver. Spot-welded to it\r\nwere all manner of soda tins, pounded flat and cut into gears, chutes,\r\nsprings and other mechanical apparatus.\r\n\r\n\"It's a mechanical calculator,\" he said proudly. \"About half as\r\npowerful as Univac. I milled all the parts using a laser-cutter. What\r\nyou do is, fill this hopper with GI Joe heads, and this hopper with\r\nBarbie heads. Crank this wheel and it will drop a number of M&Ms equal\r\nto the product of the two values into this hopper, here.\" He put three\r\nscuffed GI Joe heads in one hopper and four scrofulous Barbies in\r\nanother and began to crank, slowly. A music-box beside the crank\r\nplayed a slow, irregular rendition of \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" while the\r\nhundreds of little coin-sized gears turned, flipping switches and\r\nadding and removing tension to springs. After the weasel popped a few\r\ntimes, twelve brown M&Ms fell into an outstretched rubber hand. He\r\npicked them out carefully and offered them to her. \"It's OK. They're\r\nnot from the trash,\" he said. \"I buy them in bulk.\" He turned his\r\nbroad back to her and heaved a huge galvanized tin washtub full of\r\nbrown M&Ms in her direction. \"See, it's a bit-bucket!\" he said.\r\n\r\nSuzanne giggled in spite of herself. \"You guys are hilarious,\" she\r\nsaid. \"This is really good, exciting nerdy stuff.\" The gears on the\r\nmechanical computer were really sharp and precise; they looked like\r\nyou could cut yourself on them. When they ground over the polished\r\nsurfaces of the car-doors, they made a sound like a box of toothpicks\r\nfalling to the floor: click-click, clickclickclick, click. She turned\r\nthe crank until twelve more brown M&Ms fell out.\r\n\r\n\"Who's the Van Halen fan?\"\r\n\r\nLester beamed. \"Might as well jump -- JUMP!\" He mimed heavy-metal\r\nair-guitar and thrashed his shorn head up and down as though he were\r\nheadbanging with a mighty mane of hair-band locks. \"You're the first\r\none to get the joke!\" he said. \"Even Perry didn't get it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get what?\" Perry said, also grinning.\r\n\r\n\"Van Halen had this thing where if there were any brown M&Ms in their\r\ndressing room they'd trash it and refuse to play. When I was a kid, I\r\nused to *dream* about being so famous that I could act like that much\r\nof a prick. Ever since, I've afforded a great personal significance to\r\nbrown M&Ms.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed again. Then she frowned a little. \"Look, I hate to break\r\nthis party up, but I came here because Kettlebelly -- crap,\r\nKettle*well* -- said that you guys exemplified everything that he\r\nwanted to do with Kodacell. This stuff you've done is all very\r\ninteresting, it's killer art, but I don't see the business-angle. So,\r\ncan you help me out here?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's step three,\" Perry said. \"C'mere.\" He led her back to his\r\nworkspace, to a platform surrounded by articulated arms terminated in\r\nwebcams, like a grocery scale in the embrace of a metal\r\nspider. \"three-d scanner,\" he said, producing a Barbie head from\r\nLester's machine and dropping it on the scales. He prodded a button\r\nand a nearby screen filled with a three-dimensional model of the head,\r\nflattened on the side where it touched the surface. He turned the head\r\nover and scanned again and now there were two digital versions of the\r\nhead on the screen. He moused one over the other until they lined up,\r\nright-clicked a drop-down menu, selected an option and then they were\r\nmerged, rotating.\r\n\r\n\"Once we've got the three-d scan, it's basically Plasticine.\" He\r\ndistorted the Barbie head, stretching it and squeezing it with the\r\nmouse. \"So we can take a real object and make this kind of protean\r\nhyper-object out of it, or drop it down to a wireframe and skin it\r\nwith any bitmap, like this.\" More fast mousing -- Barbie's head turned\r\ninto a gridded mesh, fine filaments stretching off along each mussed\r\nstrand of plastic hair. Then a Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup label\r\nwrapped around her like a stocking being pulled over her head. There\r\nwas something stupendously weird and simultaneously very comic about\r\nthe sight, the kind of inherent comedy in a cartoon stretched out on a\r\nblob of Silly Putty.\r\n\r\n\"So we can build anything out of interesting junk, with any shape, and\r\nthen we can digitize the shape. Then we can do anything we like with\r\nthe shape. Then we can output the shape.\" He typed quickly and another\r\nmachine, sealed and mammoth like an outsized photocopier, started to\r\ngrunt and churn. The air filled with a smell like Saran Wrap in a\r\nmicrowave.\r\n\r\n\"The goop we use in this thing is epoxy-based. You wouldn't want to\r\nbuild a car out of it, but it makes a mean doll-house. The last stage\r\nof the output switches to inks, so you get whatever bitmap you've\r\nskinned your object with baked right in. It does about one cubic inch\r\nper minute, so this job should be almost done now.\"\r\n\r\nHe drummed his fingers on top of the machine for a moment and then it\r\nstopped chunking and something inside it went *clunk*. He lifted a lid\r\nand reached inside and plucked out the barbie head, stretched and\r\ndistorted, skinned with a Campbell's Soup label. He handed it to\r\nSuzanne. She expected it to be warm, like a squashed penny from a\r\nmachine on Fisherman's Wharf, but it was cool and had the seamless\r\ntexture of a plastic margarine tub and the heft of a paperweight.\r\n\r\n\"So, that's the business,\" Lester said. \"Or so we're told. We've been\r\nmaking cool stuff and selling it to collectors on the web for you\r\nknow, gigantic bucks. We move one or two pieces a month at about ten\r\ngrand per. But Kettlebelly says he's going to industrialize us,\r\nalienate us from the product of our labor, and turn us into an\r\nassembly line.\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't say any such thing,\" Perry said. Suzanne was aware that her\r\nears had grown points. Perry gave Lester an affectionate slug in the\r\nshoulder. \"Lester's only kidding. What we need is a couple of\r\ndogsbodies and some bigger printers and we'll be able to turn out more\r\nmodest devices by the hundred or possibly the thousand. We can tweak\r\nthe designs really easily because nothing is coming off a mold, so\r\nthere's no setup charge, so we can do limited runs of a hundred,\r\nredesign, do another hundred. We can make 'em to order. \"\r\n\r\n\"And we need an MBA,\" Lester said. \"Kodacell's sending us a business\r\nmanager to help us turn junk into pesos.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Perry said, with a worried flick of his eyes. \"Yeah, a\r\nbusiness manager.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, I've known some business geeks who aren't total assholes,\" Lester\r\nsaid. \"Who care about what they're doing and the people they're doing\r\nit with. Respectful and mindful. It's like lawyers -- they're not all\r\nscumbags. Some of them are totally awesome and save your ass.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne took all this in, jotting notes on an old-fashioned\r\nspiral-bound shirt-pocket notebook. \"When's he arriving?\"\r\n\r\n\"Next week,\" Lester said. \"We've cleared him a space to work and\r\neverything. He's someone that Kettlewell's people recruited up in\r\nIthaca and he's going to move here to work with us, sight\r\nunseen. Crazy, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Crazy,\" Suzanne agreed.\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" Perry said. \"That's next week, and this aft we've got some\r\nwork to do, but now I'm ready for lunch. You guys ready for lunch?\"\r\n\r\nSomething about food and really fat guys, it seemed like an awkward\r\nquestion to Suzanne, like asking someone who'd been horribly\r\ndisfigured by burns if he wanted to toast a marshmallow. But Lester\r\ndidn't react to the question -- of course not, he had to eat, everyone\r\nhad to eat.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, let's do the IHOP.\" Lester trundled back to his half of the\r\nworkspace, then came back with a cane in one hand. \"There's like three\r\nplaces to eat within walking distance of here if you don't count the\r\nmobile Mexican burrito wagon, which I don't, since it's a rolling\r\nadvertisement for dysentery. The IHOP is the least objectionable of\r\nthose.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could drive somewhere,\" Suzanne said. It was coming up on noon and\r\nthe heat once they got outside into the mall's ruins was like the\r\nsteam off a dishwasher. She plucked at her blouse a couple of times.\r\n\r\n\"It's the only chance to exercise we get,\" Perry said. \"It's pretty\r\nmuch impossible to live or work within walking distance of anything\r\ndown here. You end up living in your car.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so they hiked along the side of the road. The sidewalk was a\r\ncurious mix of old and new, the concrete unworn but still overgrown by\r\ntall sawgrass thriving in the Florida heat. It brushed up against her\r\nankles, hard and sharp, unlike the grass back home.\r\n\r\nThey were walking parallel to a ditch filled with sluggish, brackish\r\nwater and populated by singing frogs, ducks, ibises, and mosquitoes in\r\ngreat number. Across the way were empty lots, ghost-plazas, dead\r\nfilling stations. Behind one of the filling stations, a cluster of\r\ntents and shacks.\r\n\r\n\"Squatters?\" she asked, pointing to the shantytown.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Perry said. \"Lots of that down here. Some of them are the\r\nparamilitary wing of the AARP, old trailer-home retirees who've run\r\nout of money and just set up camp here. Some are bums and junkies,\r\nsome are runaways. It's not as bad as it looks -- they're pretty comfy\r\nin there. We bring 'em furniture and other good pickings that show up\r\nat the junkyard. The homeless with the wherewithal to build\r\nshantytowns, they haven't gone all animal like the shopping cart\r\npeople and the scary beachcombers.\" He waved across the malarial ditch\r\nto an old man in a pair of pressed khaki shorts and a crisp Bermuda\r\nshirt. \"Hey Francis!\" he called. The old man waved back. \"We'll have\r\nsome IHOP for you 'bout an hour!\" The old man ticked a salute off his\r\ncreased forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Francis is a good guy. Used to be an aerospace engineer if you can\r\nbelieve it. Wife had medical problems and he went bust taking care of\r\nher. When she died, he ended up here in his double-wide and never\r\nleft. Kind of the unofficial mayor of this little patch.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne stared after Francis. He had a bit of a gimpy leg, a limp she\r\ncould spot even from here. Beside her, Lester was puffing. No one was\r\ncomfortable walking in Florida, it seemed.\r\n\r\nIt took another half hour to reach the IHOP, the International House\r\nof Pancakes, which sat opposite a mini-mall with only one\r\nstill-breathing store, a place that advertised 99-cent t-shirts, which\r\nstruck Suzanne as profoundly depressing. There was a junkie out front\r\nof 99-Cent Tees, a woman with a leathery tan and a tiny tank-top and\r\nshorts that made her look a little like a Tenderloin hooker, but not\r\nwith that rat's-nest hair, not even in the 'Loin. She wobbled\r\nuncertainly across the parking lot to them.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" she said, with an improbable Valley Girl accent. \"Excuse\r\nme? I'm hoping to get something to eat, it's for my kid, she's\r\nnursing, gotta keep my strength up.\" Her naked arms and legs were\r\nbadly tracked out, and Suzanne had a horrified realization that among\r\nthe stains on her tank-top were a pair of spreading pools of breast\r\nmilk, dampening old white, crusted patches over her sagging\r\nbreasts. \"For my baby. A dollar would help, a dollar.\"\r\n\r\nThere were homeless like this in San Francisco, too. In San Jose as\r\nwell, she supposed, but she didn't know where they hid. But something\r\nabout this woman, cracked out and tracked out, it freaked her out. She\r\ndug into her purse and got out a five dollar bill and handed it to the\r\nhomeless woman. The woman smiled a snaggletoothed stumpy grin and\r\nreached for it, then, abruptly, grabbed hold of Suzanne's wrist. Her\r\ngrip was damp and weak.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you fucking look at me like that. You're not better than me,\r\nbitch!\" Suzanne tugged free and stepped back quickly. \"That's right,\r\nrun away! Bitch! Fuck you! Enjoy your lunch!\"\r\n\r\nShe was shaking. Perry and Lester closed ranks around her. Lester\r\nmoved to confront the homeless woman.\r\n\r\n\"The fuck you want lard ass? You wanna fuck with me? I got a knife,\r\nyou know, cut your ears off and feed 'em to ya.\"\r\n\r\nLester cocked his head like the RCA Victor dog. He towered over the\r\nskinny junkie, and was five or six times wider than her.\r\n\r\n\"You all right?\" he said gently.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yeah, I'm just fine,\" she said. \"Why, you looking for a party?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed. \"You're joking -- I'd crush you!\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed too, a less crazy, more relaxed sound. Lester's voice was\r\na low, soothing rumble. \"I don't think my friend thinks she's any\r\nbetter than you. I think she just wanted to help you out.\"\r\n\r\nThe junkie flicked her eyes back and forth. \"Listen can you spare a\r\ndollar for my baby?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think she just wanted to help you. Can I get you some lunch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fuckers won't let me in -- won't let me use the toilet even. It's not\r\nhumane. Don't want to go in the bushes. Not dignified to go in the\r\nbushes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" he said. \"What if I get you some take out, you got a\r\nshady place you could eat it? Nursing's hungry work.\"\r\n\r\nThe junkie cocked her head. Then she laughed. \"Yeah, OK, yeah. Sure --\r\nthanks, thanks a lot!\"\r\n\r\nLester motioned her over to the menu in the IHOP window and waited\r\nwith her while she picked out a helping of caramel-apple waffles,\r\nsausage links, fried eggs, hash browns, coffee, orange juice and a\r\nchocolate malted. \"Is that all?\" he said, laughing, laughing, both of\r\nthem laughing, all of them laughing at the incredible, outrageous\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nThey went in and waited by the podium. The greeter, a black guy with\r\ncorn-rows, nodded at Lester and Perry like an old friend. \"Hey Tony,\"\r\nLester said. \"Can you get us a go-bag with some take-out for the lady\r\noutside before we sit down?\" He recited the astounding order.\r\n\r\nTony shook his head and ducked it. \"OK, be right up,\" he said. \"You\r\nwant to sit while you're waiting?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll wait here, thanks,\" Lester said. \"Don't want her to think we're\r\nbailing on her.\" He turned and waved at her.\r\n\r\n\"She's mean, you know -- be careful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Tony,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\nSuzanne marveled at Lester's equanimity. Nothing got his goat. The\r\ndoggie bag arrived. \"I put some extra napkins and a couple of wet-naps\r\nin there,\" Tony said, handing it to him.\r\n\r\n\"Great!\" Lester said. \"You guys sit down, I'll be back in a second.\"\r\n\r\nPerry motioned for Suzanne to follow him to a booth. He\r\nlaughed. \"Lester's a good guy,\" he said. \"The best guy I know, you\r\nknow?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know him?\" she asked, taking out her notepad.\r\n\r\n\"He was the sysadmin at a company that was making three-d printers,\r\nand I was a tech at a company that was buying them, and the products\r\ndidn't work, and I spent a lot of time on the phone with him\r\ntroubleshooting them. We'd get together in our off-hours and hack\r\naround with neat little workbench projects, stuff we'd come up with at\r\nwork. When both companies went under, we got a bunch of their\r\nequipment at bankruptcy auctions. Lester's uncle owned the junkyard\r\nand he offered us space to set up our workshops and the rest is\r\nhistory.\"\r\n\r\nLester joined them again. He was laughing. \"She is *funny*,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Kept hefting the sack and saying, 'Christ what those bastards\r\nput on a plate, no wonder this country's so goddamned fat!'\" Perry\r\nlaughed, too. Suzanne chuckled nervously and looked away.\r\n\r\nHe slid into the booth next to her and put a hand on her\r\nshoulder. \"It's OK. I'm a guy who weighs nearly 400 pounds. I know I'm\r\na big, fat guy. If I was sensitive about it, I couldn't last ten\r\nminutes. I'm not proud of being as big as I am, but I'm not ashamed\r\neither. I'm OK with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't lose weight if you could?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, why not? But I've concluded it's not an option anymore. I was\r\nalways a fat kid, and so I never got good at sports, never got that\r\nhabit. Now I've got this huge deficit when I sit down to exercise,\r\nbecause I'm lugging around all this lard. Can't run more than a few\r\nsteps. Walking's about it. Couldn't join a pick-up game of baseball or\r\nget out on the tennis court. I never learned to cook, either, though I\r\nsuppose I could. But mostly I eat out, and I try to order sensibly,\r\nbut just look at the crap they feed us at the places we can get to --\r\nthere aren't any health food restaurants in the strip malls. Look at\r\nthis menu,\" he said, tapping a pornographic glossy picture of a stack\r\nof glistening waffles oozing with some kind of high-fructose\r\nlube. \"Caramel pancakes with whipped cream, maple syrup and canned\r\nstrawberries. When I was a kid, we called that *candy*. These people\r\nwill sell you an eight dollar, 18 ounce plate of candy with a side of\r\nsausage, eggs, biscuits, bacon and a pint of orange juice. Even if you\r\norder this stuff and eat a third of it, a quarter of it, that's\r\nprobably too much, and when you've got a lot of food in front of you,\r\nit's pretty hard to know when to stop.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sure, will-power. Will-power *nothing*. The thing is, when three\r\nquarters of America are obese, when half are dangerously obese, like\r\nme, years off our lives from all the fat -- that tells you that this\r\nisn't a will-power problem. We didn't get less willful in the last\r\nfifty years. Might as well say that all those people who died of the\r\nplague lacked the will-power to keep their houses free of rats. Fat\r\nisn't moral, it's *epidemiological*. There are a small number of\r\npeople, a tiny minority, whose genes are short-circuited in a way that\r\nmakes them less prone to retaining nutrients. That's a maladaptive\r\ntrait through most of human history -- burning unnecessary calories\r\nwhen you've got to chase down an antelope to get more, that's no way\r\nto live long enough to pass on your genes! So you and Perry over here\r\nwith your little skinny selves, able to pack away transfats and\r\nhigh-fructose corn-syrup and a pound of candy for breakfast at the\r\nIHOP, you're not doing this on will-power -- you're doing it by\r\nexpressing the somatotype of a recessive, counter-survival gene.\r\n\r\n\"Would I like to be thinner? Sure. But I'm not gonna let the fact that\r\nI'm genetically better suited to famine than feast get to me. Speaking\r\nof, let's eat. Tony, c'mere, buddy. I want a plate of candy!\" He was\r\nsmiling, and brave, and at that moment, Suzanne thought that she could\r\nget a crush on this guy, this big, smart, talented, funny, lovable\r\nguy. Then reality snapped back and she saw him as he was, sexless,\r\nlumpy, almost grotesque. The overlay of his, what, his *inner beauty*\r\non that exterior, it disoriented her. She looked back over her notes.\r\n\r\n\"So, you say that there's a third coming out to work with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"To *live* with us,\" Perry said. \"That's part of the deal. Geek\r\nhouses, like in the old college days. We're going to be a power-trio:\r\ntwo geeks and a suit, lean and mean. The suit's name is Tjan, and he's\r\nSingaporean by way of London by way of Ithaca, where Kettlebelly found\r\nhim. We've talked on the phone a couple times and he's moving down\r\nnext week.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's moving down without ever having met you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, that's the way it goes. It's like the army or something for us:\r\nonce you're in you get dispatched here or there. It was in the\r\ncontract. We already had a place down here with room for Tjan, so we\r\nput some fresh linen on the guest-bed and laid in an extra\r\ntoothbrush.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a little nervous-making,\" Lester said. \"Perry and I get along\r\ngreat, but I haven't had such good luck with business-types. It's not\r\nthat I'm some kind of idealist who doesn't get the need to make money,\r\nbut they can be so condescending, you know?\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne nodded. \"That's a two-way street, you know. 'Suits' don't like\r\nbeing talked down to by engineers.\"\r\n\r\nLester raised a hand. \"Guilty as charged.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what're you planning to do for the rest of the week?\" It was\r\nWednesday, and she'd counted on getting this part of the story by\r\nSaturday, but here she was going to have to wait, clearly, until this\r\nTjan arrived.\r\n\r\n\"Same stuff as we always do. We build crazy stuff out of junk, sell it\r\nto collectors, and have fun. We could go to the Thunderbird Drive In\r\ntonight if you want, it's a real classic, flea-market by day and drive\r\nin by night, practically the last one standing.\"\r\n\r\nPerry cut in. \"Or we could go to South Beach and get a good meal, if\r\nthat's more your speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naw,\" Suzanne said. \"Drive in sounds great, especially if it's such a\r\ndying breed. Better get a visit in while there's still time.\"\r\n\r\nThey tried to treat her but she wouldn't let them. She never let\r\nanyone buy her so much as a cup of coffee. It was an old\r\njournalism-school drill, and she was practically the only scribbler\r\nshe knew who hewed to it: some of the whores on the Silicon Valley\r\npapers took in free computers, trips, even spa days! -- but she had\r\nnever wavered.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe afternoon passed quickly and enchantingly. Perry was working on a\r\nknee-high, articulated Frankenstein monster built out of hand-painted\r\nseashells from a beach-side kitsch market. They said GOD BLESS AMERICA\r\nand SOUVENIR OF FLORIDA and CONCH REPUBLIC and each had to be fitted\r\nout for a motor custom built to conform to its contours.\r\n\r\n\"When it's done, it will make toast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make toast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, separate a single slice off a loaf, load it into a top-loading\r\nslice-toaster, depress the lever, time the toast-cycle, retrieve the\r\ntoast and butter it. I got the idea from old-time backup-tape\r\nloaders. This plus a toaster will function as a loosely coupled single\r\nsystem.\"\r\n\r\n\"OK, that's really cool, but I have to ask the boring question,\r\nPerry. Why? Why build a toast-robot?\"\r\n\r\nPerry stopped working and dusted his hands off. He was really built,\r\nand his shaggy hair made him look younger than his crows-feet\r\nsuggested. He turned a seashell with a half-built motor in it over and\r\nspun it like a top on the hand-painted WEATHER IS HERE/WISH YOU WERE\r\nBEAUTIFUL legend.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's the question, isn't it? The simple answer: people buy\r\nthem. Collectors. So it's a good hobby business, but that's not really\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"It's like this: engineering is all about constraint. Given a span of\r\nfoo feet and materials of tensile strength of bar, build a bridge that\r\ndoesn't go all fubared. Write a fun video-game for an eight-bit\r\nconsole that'll fit in 32K. Build the fastest airplane, or the one\r\nwith the largest carrying capacity... But these days, there's not much\r\ntraditional constraint. I've got the engineer's most dangerous luxury:\r\nplenty. All the computational cycles I'll ever need. Easy and rapid\r\nprototyping. Precision tools.\r\n\r\n\"Now, it may be that there is a suite of tasks lurking *in potentia*\r\nthat demand all this resource and more -- maybe I'm like some\r\nlocomotive engineer declaring that 60 miles per hour is the pinnacle\r\nof machine velocity, that speed is cracked. But I don't see many of\r\nthose problems -- none that interest me.\r\n\r\n\"What I've got here are my own constraints. I'm challenging myself,\r\nusing found objects and making stuff that throws all this\r\ncomputational capacity at, you know, these *trivial* problems, like\r\ncar-driving Elmo clusters and seashell toaster-robots. We have so much\r\ncapacity that the trivia expands to fill it. And all that capacity is\r\njunk-capacity, it's leftovers. There's enough computational capacity\r\nin a junkyard to launch a space-program, and that's by\r\ndesign. Remember the iPod? Why do you think it was so prone to\r\nscratching and going all gunky after a year in your pocket? Why would\r\nApple build a handheld technology out of materials that turned to shit\r\nif you looked at them cross-eyed? It's because the iPod was only meant\r\nto last a year!\r\n\r\n\"It's like tailfins -- they were cool in the Tailfin Cretaceous, but\r\nwouldn't it have been better if they could have disappeared from view\r\nwhen they became aesthetically obsolete, when the space age withered\r\nup and blew away? Oh, not really, obviously, because it's nice to see\r\na well-maintained land-yacht on the highway every now and again, if\r\nonly for variety's sake, but if you're going to design something that\r\nis meant to be *au fait* then presumably you should have some planned\r\nobsolescence in there, some end-of-lifing strategy for the aesthetic\r\ncrash that follows any couture movement. Here, check this out.\"\r\n\r\nHe handed her a white brick, the size of a deck of cards. It took her\r\na moment to recognize it as an iPod. \"Christ, it's *huge*,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, isn't it just. Remember how small and shiny this thing was when\r\nit shipped? 'A thousand songs in your pocket!'\"\r\n\r\nThat made her actually laugh out loud. She fished in her pocket for\r\nher earbuds and dropped them on the table where they clattered like\r\nM&Ms. \"I *think* I've got about 40,000 songs on those. Haven't run out\r\nof space yet, either.\"\r\n\r\nHe rolled the buds around in his palm like a pair of dice. \"You won't\r\n-- I stopped keeping track of mine after I added my hundred-thousandth\r\naudiobook. I've got a bunch of the Library of Congress in mine as\r\nhigh-rez scans, too. A copy of the Internet Archive, every post ever\r\nmade on Usenet... Basically, these things are infinitely capacious,\r\ngiven the size of the media we work with today.\" He rolled the buds\r\nout on the workbench and laughed. \"And that's just the point!\r\nTomorrow, we'll have some new extra fat kind of media and some new\r\ntask to perform with it and some new storage medium that will make\r\nthese things look like an old iPod. Before that happens, you want this\r\nto wear out and scuff up or get lost --\"\r\n\r\n\"I lose those things all the time, like a set a month.\"\r\n\r\n\"There you go then! The iPods were too big to lose like that, but just\r\n*look at them*.\" The iPod's chrome was scratched to the point of being\r\nfogged, like the mirror in a gas-station toilet. The screen was almost\r\nunreadable for all the scratches. \"They had scratch-proof materials\r\nand hard plastics back then. They *chose* to build these things out of\r\nSaran Wrap and tin-foil so that by the time they doubled in capacity\r\nnext year, you'd have already worn yours out and wouldn't feel bad\r\nabout junking them.\r\n\r\n\"So I'm building a tape-loading seashell robot toaster out of\r\ndiscarded obsolete technology because the world is full of capacious,\r\ncapable, disposable junk and it cries out to be used again. It's a\r\npotlatch: I have so much material and computational wealth that I can\r\nafford to waste it on frivolous junk. I think that's why the\r\ncollectors buy it, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"That brings us back to the question of your relationship with\r\nKodacell. They want to do what, exactly, with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we've been playing with some mass-production techniques, the\r\nthree-d printer and so on. When Kettlebelly called me, he said that he\r\nwanted to see about using the scanner and so on to make a lot of these\r\nthings, at a low price-point. It's pretty perverse when you think\r\nabout it: using modern technology to build replicas of obsolete\r\ntechnology rescued from the dump, when these replicas are bound to end\r\nup back here at the dump!\" He laughed. He had nice laugh-lines around\r\nhis eyes. \"Anyway, it's something that Lester and I had talked about\r\nfor a long time, but never really got around to. Too much like\r\nretail. It's bad enough dealing with a couple dozen collectors who'll\r\npay ten grand for a sculpture: who wants to deal with ten thousand\r\ncustomers who'll go a dollar each for the same thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you figure that this Tjan character will handle all the customer\r\nstuff?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the idea: he'll run the business side, we'll get more time to\r\nhack; everyone gets paid. Kodacell's got some micro-sized marketing\r\nagencies, specialized PR firms, creative shippers, all kinds of little\r\nthree-person outfits that they've promised to hook us up with. Tjan\r\ninterfaces with them, we do our thing, enrich the shareholders, get\r\nstock ourselves. It's supposed to be all upside. Hell, if it doesn't\r\nwork we can just walk away and find another dump and go back into the\r\ncollectors' market.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up his half-finished shell and swung a lamp with a\r\nmagnifying lens built into it over his workspace. \"Hey, just a sec,\r\nOK? I've just figured out what I was doing wrong before.\" He took up a\r\nlittle tweezers and a plastic rod and probed for a moment, then daubed\r\nsome solder down inside the shell's guts. He tweezed a wire to a\r\ncontact and the shell made a motorized sound, a peg sticking out of it\r\nbegan to move rhythmically.\r\n\r\n\"Got it,\" he said. He set it down. \"I don't expect I'm going to be\r\ndoing many more of these projects after next week. This kind of\r\ndesign, we could never mass-produce it.\" He looked a little wistful,\r\nand Suzanne suppressed a smile. What a tortured artiste this Florida\r\njunkyard engineer was!\r\n\r\nAs the long day drew to a close, they went out for a walk in the\r\ntwilight's cool in the yard. The sopping humidity of the day settled\r\naround them as the sun set in a long summer blaze that turned the dry\r\nfountain full of Christmas ornaments into a luminescent bowl of\r\njewels.\r\n\r\n\"I got some real progress today,\" Lester said. He had a cane with him\r\nand he was limping heavily. \"Got the printer to output complete\r\nmechanical logical gates, all in one piece, Almost no assembly, just\r\ndaisy-chain them on a board. And I've been working on a standard\r\nsnap-on system for lego-bricking each gate to the next. It's going to\r\nmake it a lot easier to ramp up production.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah?\" Perry said. He asked a technical question about the printer,\r\nsomething about the goop's tensile strength that Suzanne couldn't\r\nfollow. They went at it, hammer and tongs, talking through the\r\nabstruse details faster than she could follow, walking more and more\r\nquickly past the vast heaps of dead technology and half-built mall\r\nstores.\r\n\r\nShe let them get ahead of her and stopped to gather her thoughts. She\r\nturned around to take it all in and that's when she caught sight of\r\nthe kids sneaking into Perry and Lester's lab.\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" she shouted, in her loudest Detroit voice. \"What are you doing\r\nthere?\" There were three of them, in Miami Dolphins jerseys and shiny\r\nbald-shaved heads and little shorts, the latest inexplicable rapper\r\nstyle which made them look more like drag queens in mufti than\r\ntough-guys.\r\n\r\nThey rounded on her. They were heavyset and their eyebrows were\r\nbleached blond. They had been sneaking into the lab's side-door,\r\nlooking about as inconspicuous as a trio of nuns.\r\n\r\n\"Get lost!\" she shouted. \"Get out of here! Perry, Lester!\"\r\n\r\nThey were coming closer now. They didn't move so well, puffing in the\r\nheat, but they clearly had mayhem on their minds. She reached into her\r\npurse for her pepper spray and held it before her dramatically, but\r\nthey didn't stop coming.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the air was rent by the loudest sound she'd ever heard, like\r\nshe'd put her head inside a foghorn. She flinched and misted a cloud\r\nof aerosol capsicum ahead of her. She had the presence of mind to step\r\nback quickly, before catching a blowback, but she wasn't quick enough,\r\nfor her eyes and nose started to burn and water. The sound wouldn't\r\nstop, it just kept going on, a sound like her head was too small to\r\ncontain her brain, a sound that made her teeth ache. The three kids\r\nhad stopped and staggered off.\r\n\r\n\"You OK?\" The voice sounded like it was coming from far, far away,\r\nthough Lester was right in front of her. She found that she'd dropped\r\nto her knees in the teeth of that astonishing noise.\r\n\r\nShe let him help her to her feet. \"Jesus,\" she said, putting a hand to\r\nher ears. They rang like she'd been at a rave all night. \"What the\r\nhell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anti-personnel sonic device,\" Lester said. She realized that he was\r\nshouting, but she could barely hear it. \"It doesn't do any permanent\r\ndamage, but it'll scare off most anyone. Those kids probably live in\r\nthe shantytown we passed this morning. More and more of them are\r\njoining gangs. They're our neighbors, so we don't want to shoot them\r\nor anything.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. The ringing in her ears was subsiding a little. Lester\r\nsteadied her. She leaned on him. He was big and solid. He wore the\r\nsame cologne as her father had, she realized.\r\n\r\nShe moved away from him and smoothed out her shorts, dusting off her\r\nknees. \"Did you invent that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Made it using a HOWTO I found online,\" he said. \"Lot of kids around\r\nhere up to no good. It's pretty much a homebrew civil defense siren --\r\nrugged and cheap.\"\r\n\r\nShe put a finger in each ear and scratched at the itchy buzzing. When\r\nshe removed them, her hearing was almost back to normal. \"I once had\r\nan upstairs neighbor in Cambridge who had a stereo system that loud --\r\nnever thought I'd hear it again.\"\r\n\r\nPerry came and joined them. \"I followed them a bit, they're way gone\r\nnow. I think I recognized one of them from the campsite. I'll talk to\r\nFrancis about it and see if he can set them right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been broken into before?\"\r\n\r\n\"A few times. Mostly what we worry about is someone trashing the\r\nprinters. Everything else is easy to replace, but when Lester's old\r\nemployer went bust we bought up about fifty of these things at the\r\nauction and I don't know where we'd lay hands on them again. Computers\r\nare cheap and it's not like anyone could really *steal* all this\r\njunk.\" He flashed her his good-looking, confident smile again.\r\n\r\n\"What time do the movies start?\"\r\n\r\nLester checked his watch. \"About an hour after sunset. If we leave now\r\nwe can get a real dinner at a Haitian place I know and then head over\r\nto the Thunderbird. I'll hide under a blanket in the back seat so that\r\nwe can save on admission!\"\r\n\r\nShe'd done that many times as a kid, her father shushing her and her\r\nbrother as they giggled beneath the blankets. The thought of giant\r\nLester doing it made her chuckle. \"I think we can afford to pay for\r\nyou,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was good -- fiery spicy fish and good music in an old tiki\r\nbar with peeling grass wallpaper that managed to look vaguely\r\nHaitian. The waiters spoke Spanish, not French, though. She let\r\nherself be talked into two bottles of beer -- about one and a half\r\nmore than she would normally take -- but she didn't get\r\nlight-headed. The heat and humidity seemed to rinse the alcohol right\r\nout of her bloodstream.\r\n\r\nThey got to the movies just at dusk. It was just like she remembered\r\nfrom being a little girl and coming with her parents. Children in\r\npajamas climbed over a jungle-gym to one side of the lot. Ranked rows\r\nof cars faced the huge, grubby white projection walls. They even\r\nshowed one of those scratchy old \"Let's all go to the lobby and get\r\nourselves a treat\" cartoon shorts with the dancing hot-dogs before the\r\nmovie.\r\n\r\nThe nostalgia filled her up like a balloon expanding in her chest. She\r\nhadn't ever seen a computer until she was ten years old, and that had\r\nbeen the size of a chest-freezer, with less capability than one of the\r\nactive printed-computer cards that came in glossy fashion magazines\r\nwith come-ons for perfume and weight-loss.\r\n\r\nThe world had been stood on its head so many times in the intervening\r\nthirty-plus years that it was literally dizzying -- or was that the\r\nbeer having a delayed effect? Suddenly all the certainties she rested\r\non -- her 401k, her house, her ability to navigate the professional\r\nworld in a competent manner -- seemed to be built on shifting sands.\r\n\r\nThey'd come in Lester's car, a homemade auto built around two electric\r\nSmart cars joined together to form a kind of mini-sedan with room\r\nenough for Lester to slide into the driver's perch with room to\r\nspare. Once they arrived, they unpacked clever folding chairs and sat\r\nthem beside the car, rolled down the windows, and turned up the\r\nspeakers. It was a warm night, but not sticky the way it had been that\r\nday, and the kiss of the wind that rustled the leaves of the tall\r\npalms ringing the theater was like balm.\r\n\r\nThe movie was something forgettable about bumbling detectives on the\r\nmoon, one of those trendy new things acted entirely by animated dead\r\nactors who combined the virtues of box-office draw and cheap\r\nlabor. There might have been a couple of fictional actors in there\r\ntoo, it was hard to say, she'd never really followed the movies except\r\nas a place to escape to. There was real magic and escape in a\r\ndrive-in, though, with the palpable evidence of all those other\r\nbreathing humans in the darkened night watching the magic story\r\nflicker past on the screen, something that went right into her\r\nhindbrain. Before she knew it, her eyelids were drooping and then she\r\nfound herself jerking awake. This happened a couple times before\r\nLester slipped a pillow under her head and she sank into it and fell\r\ninto sleep.\r\n\r\nShe woke at the closing credits and realized that she'd managed to\r\nprop the pillow on Lester's barrel-chest. She snapped her head up and\r\nthen smiled embarrassedly at him. \"Hey, sleepyhead,\" he said. \"You\r\nsnore like a bandsaw, you know it?\"\r\n\r\nShe blushed. \"I don't!\"\r\n\r\n\"You do,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I do?\"\r\n\r\nPerry, on her other side nodded. \"You do.\"\r\n\r\n\"God,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, you haven't got anything on Lester,\" Perry said. \"I've\r\ngone into his room some mornings and found all the pictures lying on\r\nthe floor, vibrated off their hooks.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that Lester was blushing now.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry if I spoiled the movie,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Don't sweat it,\" Lester said, clearly grateful for the change of\r\nsubject. \"It was a lousy movie anyway. You drowned out some truly foul\r\ndialogue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's that.\"\r\n\r\n\"C'mon, let's go back to the office and get you your car. It's an hour\r\nto Miami from here.\"\r\n\r\nShe was wide awake by the time she parked the rent-a-car in the\r\ncoffin-hotel's parking lot and crawled into her room, slapping the\r\nair-con buttons up to full to clear out the stifling air that had\r\nbaked into the interior during the day.\r\n\r\nShe lay on her back in the dark coffin for a long time, eyes open and\r\nslowly adjusting to the idiot lights on the control panel, until it\r\nseemed that she was lying in a space capsule hurtling through the\r\nuniverse at relativistic speeds, leaving behind history, the world,\r\neverything she knew. She sat up, wide awake, on West Coast time\r\nsuddenly, and there was no way she would fall asleep now, but she lay\r\nback down and then she did, finally.\r\n\r\nThe alarm woke her seemingly five minutes later. She did a couple laps\r\naround the parking lot, padding around, stretching her legs, trying to\r\nclear her head -- her internal clock thought that it was 4AM, but at\r\n7AM on the east coast, the sun was up and the heat had begun to sizzle\r\nall the available moisture into the air. She left the hotel and drove\r\naround Miami for a while. She needed to find some toiletries and then\r\na cafe where she could sit down and file some copy. She'd tweeted a\r\nbunch of working notes and posted a few things to her blog the day\r\nbefore, but her editor expected something more coherent for those who\r\npreferred their news a little more digested.\r\n\r\nBy the time she arrived at Perry's junkyard, the day had tipped for\r\nafternoon, the sun no longer straight overhead, the heat a little\r\nsofter than it had been the day before. She settled in for another day\r\nof watching the guys work, asking the occasional question. The column\r\nshe'd ended up filing had been a kind of wait-and-see piece,\r\ndescribing the cool culture these two had going between them, and\r\nasking if it could survive scaling up to mass production. Now she\r\nexperimented with their works-in-progress, sculptures and machines\r\nthat almost worked, or didn't work at all, but that showed the scope\r\nof their creativity. Kettlewell thought that there were a thousand,\r\nten thousand people as creative as these two out there, waiting to be\r\ndiscovered. Could it be true?\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Perry said, \"why not? We're just here because someone dropped\r\nthe barrier to entry, made it possible for a couple of tinkerers to\r\nget a lot of materials and to assemble them without knowing a whole\r\nlot about advanced materials science. Wasn't it like this when the\r\nInternet was starting out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Woah,\" Suzanne said. \"I just realized that you wouldn't really\r\nremember those days, back in the early nineties.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure I remember them. I was a kid, but I remember them fine!\"\r\n\r\nShe felt very old. \"The thing was that no one really suspected that\r\nthere were so many liberal arts majors lurking in the nation's\r\nuniversities, dying to drop out and learn perl and HTML.\"\r\n\r\nPerry cocked his head. \"Yeah, I guess that's analogous. The legacy of\r\nthe dotcom years for me is all this free infrastructure, very cheap\r\nnetwork connections and hosting companies and so on. That, I guess,\r\ncombined with people willing to use it. I never really thought of it,\r\nbut there must have been a lot of people hanging around in the old\r\ndays who thought email and the net were pretty sketchy, right?\"\r\n\r\nShe waved her hands at him. \"Perry, lad, you don't know the half of\r\nit. There are *still* executives in the rustbelt who spend bailout\r\nmoney on secretaries to print out their email and then dictate replies\r\ninto tape recorders to be typed and sent.\"\r\n\r\nHe furrowed his thick eyebrows. \"You're joking,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on her heart. \"I kid you not. I knew people in the\r\nnewsroom at the Detroit Free Press. There are whole industries in this\r\ncountry that are living in the last century.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, for me, all that dotcommie stuff was like putting down a good\r\nbase, making it easy for people like me to get parts and build-logs\r\nand to find hardware hackers to jam with.\"\r\n\r\nPerry got engrossed in a tricky bit of engine-in-seashell then and she\r\nwandered over to Lester, who was printing out more Barbie heads for a\r\nmuch larger version of his mechanical computer. \"It'll be able to add,\r\nsubtract, and multiply any two numbers up to 99,\" he said. \"It took\r\ndecades to build a vacuum-tube machine that could do that much -- I'm\r\ndoing it with *switches* in just three revs. In your face, UNIVAC!\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. He had a huge bag of laser-cut soda-can switches that he\r\nwas soldering onto a variety of substrates from polished car-doors to\r\na bamboo tiki-bar. She looked closely at the solder. \"Is this what\r\nsweatshop solder looks like?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked confused, then said, \"Oh! Right, Perry's thing. Yeah,\r\nanything not done by a robot has this artisanal quality of blobbiness,\r\nwhich I quite like, it's aesthetic, like a painting with visible\r\nbrushstrokes. But Perry's right: if you see solder like this on\r\nanything that there are a million of, then you know that it was laid\r\ndown by kids and women working for slave wages. There's no way it's\r\ncheaper to make a million solders by hand than by robot unless your\r\nlabor force is locked in, force-fed amphetamine, and destroyed for\r\nanything except prostitution inside of five years. But here, in\r\nsomething like this, so handmade and one of a kind, I think it gives\r\nit a nice cargo-cult neoprimitive feel. Like a field of hand-tilled\r\nfurrows.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. Today she was keeping her computer out, writing down\r\nquotes and tweeting thoughts as they came. They worked side by side in\r\ncompanionable silence for a while as she killed a couple thousand\r\nspams and he laid down a couple dozen blobs of solder.\r\n\r\n\"How do you like Florida?\" he said, after straightening up and\r\ncracking his back.\r\n\r\nShe barely stopped typing, deep into some email: \"It's all right, I\r\nsuppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's great stuff here if you know where to look. Want me to show\r\nyou around a little tonight? It's Friday, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds good. Is Perry free?\"\r\n\r\nIt took her a second to register that he hadn't answered. She looked\r\nup and saw he was blushing to the tips of his ears. \"I thought we\r\ncould go out just the two of us. Dinner and a walk around the deco\r\nstuff on Miami Beach?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she said. And the weird thing was, she took it seriously for a\r\nsecond. She hadn't been on a date in something like a year, and he was\r\na really nice guy and so forth. But professional ethics made that\r\nimpossible, and besides.\r\n\r\nAnd besides. He was huge. He'd told her he weighed nearly 400\r\npounds. So fat, he was, essentially, sexless. Round and unshaped,\r\ndoughy.\r\n\r\nAll of these thoughts in an instant and then she said, \"Oh,\r\nwell. Listen, Lester, it's about professional ethics. I'm here on a\r\nstory and you guys are really swell, but I'm here to be\r\nobjective. That means no dating. Sorry.\" She said it in the same firm\r\ntones as she'd used to turn down their offer to treat her at the IHOP:\r\na fact of life, something she just didn't do. Like turning down a\r\nglass of beer by saying, \"No thanks, I don't drink.\" No value\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nBut she could see that she had let her thinking show on her face, if\r\nonly for the briefest moment. Lester stiffened and his nostrils\r\nflared. He wiped his hands on his thighs, then said, in a light tone,\r\n\"Sure, no problem. I understand completely. Should have thought of\r\nthat. Sorry!\"\r\n\r\n\"No problem,\" she said. She pretended to work on her email a while\r\nlonger, then said, \"Well, I think I'll call it a day. See you Monday\r\nfor Tjan's arrival, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" he said, too brightly, and she slunk away to her car.\r\n\r\nShe spent the weekend blogging and seeing the beach. The people on the\r\nbeach seemed to be of another species from the ones she saw walking\r\nthe streets of Hollywood and Miami and Lauderdale. They had freakishly\r\nperfect bodies, the kind of thing you saw in an anatomical drawing or\r\na comic-book -- so much muscular definition that they were practically\r\ncross-hatched. She even tried out the nude beach, intrigued to see\r\nthese perfect specimens in the all-together, but she chickened out\r\nwhen she realized that she'd need a substantial wax-job before her\r\nbody hair was brought down to norms for that strip of sand.\r\n\r\nShe did get an eyeful of several anatomically correct drawings before\r\ntaking off again. It made her uncomfortably horny and aware of how\r\nlong it had been since her last date. That got her thinking of poor\r\nLester, buried underneath all that flesh, and that got her thinking\r\nabout the life she'd chosen for herself, covering the weird world of\r\ntech where the ground never stood still long enough for her to get her\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nSo she retreated to blog in a cafe, posting snippets and impressions\r\nfrom her days with the boys, along with photos. Her readers were all\r\nover it, commenting like mad. Half of them thought it was disgusting\r\n-- so much suffering and waste in the world and these guys were\r\ninventing $10,000 toys out of garbage. The other half wanted to know\r\nwhere to go to buy one for themselves. Halfway through Sunday, her\r\nlaptop battery finally died, needing a fresh weekly charge, so she\r\nretreated again, to the coffin, to wait for Monday and the new day\r\nthat would dawn for Perry and Lester and Kodacell -- and her.\r\n\r\nTjan turned out to be a lot older than she'd expected. She'd pictured\r\nhim as about 28, smart and preppie like they all were when they were\r\nfresh out of B-school and full of Management Wisdom. Instead, he was\r\nabout forty, balding, with a little pot-belly and thinning hair. He\r\ndressed like an English professor, blue-jeans and a checked shirt and\r\na tweedy sports-coat that he'd shucked within seconds of leaving the\r\nterminal at Miami airport and stepping into the blast-furnace heat.\r\n\r\nThey'd all come in Lester's big, crazy car, and squishing back in with\r\nTjan's suitcases was like a geometry trick. She found herself half on\r\nPerry's lap, hugging half a big duffel-bag that seemed to be full of\r\nbricks.\r\n\r\n\"Books,\" Tjan said. \"Just a little personal library. It's a bad habit,\r\nmoving the physical objects around, but I'm addicted.\" He had a calm\r\nvoice that might in fact be a little dull, a prof's monotone.\r\n\r\nThey brought him to Perry and Lester's place, which was three condos\r\nwith the dividing walls knocked out in a complex that had long\r\nrust-streaks down its sides and rickety balconies that had been eaten\r\naway by salt air. There was a guardhouse at the front of the complex,\r\nbut it was shuttered, abandoned, and graffiti tagged.\r\n\r\nTjan stepped out of the car and put his hands on his hips and\r\nconsidered the building. \"It could use a coat of paint,\" he\r\nsaid. Suzanne looked closely at him -- he was so deadpan, it was hard\r\nto tell what was on his mind. But he slipped her a wink.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Perry said. \"It could at that. On the bright side: spacious,\r\ncheap and there's a pool. There's a lot of this down here since the\r\nhousing market crashed. The condo association here dissolved about\r\nfour years ago, so there's not really anyone who's in charge of all\r\nthe common spaces and stuff, just a few condo owners and speculators\r\nwho own the apartments. Suckers, I'm thinking. Our rent has gone down\r\ntwice this year, just for asking. I'm thinking we could probably get\r\nthem to pay us to live here and just keep out the bums and stuff.\"\r\n\r\nThe living quarters were nearly indistinguishable from the workshop at\r\nthe junkyard: strewn with cool devices in various stages of\r\ndisassembly, detritus and art. The plates and dishes and glasses all\r\nhad IHOP and Cracker Barrel logos on them. \"From thrift shops,\" Lester\r\nexplained. \"Old people steal them when they get their earlybird\r\nspecials, and then when they die their kids give them to\r\nGoodwill. Cheapest way to get a matched set around here.\"\r\n\r\nTjan circled the three adjoined cracker-box condos like a dog circling\r\nhis basket. Finally, he picked an unoccupied master bedroom with moldy\r\nlace curtains and a motel-art painting of an abstract landscape over\r\nthe headboard. He set his suitcase down on the faux-Chinoise chest of\r\ndrawers and said, \"Right, I'm done. Let's get to work.\"\r\n\r\nThey took him to the workshop next and his expression hardly changed\r\nas they showed him around, showed him their cabinets of wonders. When\r\nthey were done, he let them walk him to the IHOP and he ordered the\r\nmost austere thing on the menu, a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich\r\nthat was technically on the kids' menu -- a kids' menu at a place\r\nwhere the grownups could order a plate of candy!\r\n\r\n\"So,\" Perry said. \"So, Tjan, come on buddy, give it to me straight --\r\nyou hate it? Love it? Can't understand it?\"\r\n\r\nTjan set down his sandwich. \"You boys are very talented,\" he\r\nsaid. \"They're very good inventions. There are lots of opportunities\r\nfor synergy within Kodacell: marketing, logistics, even packing\r\nmaterials. There's a little aerogel startup in Oregon that Kodacell is\r\nunderwriting that you could use for padding when you ship.\"\r\n\r\nPerry and Lester looked at him expectantly. Suzanne broke the\r\nsilence. \"Tjan, did you have any artistic or design ideas about the\r\nthings that these guys are making?\"\r\n\r\nTjan took another bite of sandwich and sipped at his milk. \"Well,\r\nyou'll have to come up with a name for them, something that identifies\r\nthem. Also, I think you should be careful with trademarked\r\nobjects. Any time you need to bring in an IP lawyer, you're going to\r\nrun into huge costs and time delays.\"\r\n\r\nThey waited again. \"That's it?\" Perry said. \"Nothing about the designs\r\nthemselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm the business-manager. That's editorial. I'm artistically\r\nautistic. Not my job to help you design things. It's my job to sell\r\nthe things you design.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it matter what it was we were making? Would you feel the same\r\nif it was toothbrushes or staplers?\"\r\n\r\nTjan smiled. \"If you were making staplers I wouldn't be here, because\r\nthere's no profit in staplers. Too many competitors. Toothbrushes are\r\na possibility, if you were making something really\r\nrevolutionary. People buy about 1.6 toothbrushes a year, so there's\r\nlots of opportunity to come up with an innovative design that sells at\r\na good profit over marginal cost for a couple seasons before it gets\r\ncloned or out-innovated. What you people are making has an edge\r\nbecause it's you making it, very bespoke and distinctive. I think it\r\nwill take some time for the world to emerge an effective competitor to\r\nthese goods, provided that you can build an initial marketplace\r\nmass-interest in them. There aren't enough people out there who know\r\nhow to combine all the things you've combined here. The system makes\r\nit hard to sell anything above the marginal cost of goods, unless you\r\nhave a really innovative idea, which can't stay innovative for long,\r\nso you need continuous invention and re-invention too. You two fellows\r\nappear to be doing that. I don't know anything definitive about the\r\naesthetic qualities of your gadgets, nor how useful they'll be, but I\r\n*do* understand their distinctiveness, so that's why I'm here.\"\r\n\r\nIt was longer than all the speeches he'd delivered since arriving, put\r\ntogether. Suzanne nodded and made some notes. Perry looked him up and\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"You're, what, an ex-B-school prof from Cornell, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for a few years. And I ran a company for a while, doing\r\nimport-export from emerging economy states in the former Soviet bloc.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" Perry said. \"So you're into what, a new company every 18\r\nmonths or something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" Tjan said, and he had a little twinkle in his eye and the\r\ntiniest hint of a smile. \"Oh no. Every six months. A year at the\r\noutside. That's my deal. I'm the business guy with the short attention\r\nspan.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" Perry said. \"Kettlewell didn't mention this.\"\r\n\r\nAt the junkyard, Tjan wandered around the Elmo-propelled Smart car and\r\npeered at its innards, watched the Elmos negotiate their balance and\r\nposition with minute movements and acoustic signals. \"I wouldn't worry\r\nabout it if I were you,\" he said. \"You guys aren't temperamentally\r\nsuited to doing just one thing.\"\r\n\r\nLester laughed. \"He's got you there, dude,\" he said, slapping Perry on\r\nthe shoulder.\r\n\r\nSuzanne got Tjan out for dinner that night. \"My dad was in\r\nimport-export and we travelled a lot, all over Asia and then the\r\nformer Soviets. He sent me away when I was 16 to finish school in the\r\nStates, and there was no question but that I would go to Stanford for\r\nbusiness school.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nice to meet a fellow Californian,\" she said, and sipped her\r\nwine. They'd gone to one of the famed Miami deco restaurants and the\r\nfish in front of her was practically a sculpture, so thoroughly plated\r\nit was.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm as Californian as...\"\r\n\r\n\"...as possible, under the circumstances,\" she said and laughed. \"It's\r\na Canadian joke, but it applies equally well to Californians. So you\r\nwere in B-school when?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ninety eight to 2001. Interesting times to be in the Valley. I read\r\nyour column, you know.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked down at her plate. A lot of people had read the column back\r\nthen. Women columnists were rare in tech, and she supposed she was\r\ngood at it, too. \"I hope I get remembered as more than the chronicler\r\nof the dot-com boom, though,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you will,\" he said. \"You'll be remembered as the chronicler of\r\nthis -- what Kettlewell and Perry and Lester are doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you're doing, too, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, what I'm doing too.\"\r\n\r\nA robot rollerbladed past on the boardwalk, turning the occasional\r\nsomersault. \"I should have them build some of those,\" Tjan said,\r\nwatching the crowd turn to regard it. It hopped onto and off of the\r\ncurb, expertly steered around the wandering couples and the occasional\r\nhomeless person. It had a banner it streamed out behind it: CAP'N\r\nJACKS PAINTBALL AND FANBOAT TOURS GET SHOT AND GET WET MIAMI KEY WEST\r\nLAUDERDALE.\r\n\r\n\"You think they can?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Tjan said. \"Those two can build anything. That's the point:\r\nany moderately skilled practitioner can build anything these days, for\r\npractically nothing. Back in the old days, the blacksmith just made\r\nevery bit of ironmongery everyone needed, one piece at a time, at his\r\nforge. That's where we're at. Every industry that required a factory\r\nyesterday only needs a garage today. It's a real return to\r\nfundamentals. What no one ever could do was join up all the smithies\r\nand all the smiths and make them into a single logical network with a\r\nsingle set of objectives. That's new and it's what I plan on making\r\nhay out of. This will be much bigger than dot-com. It will be much\r\nharder, too -- bigger crests, deeper troughs. This is something to\r\nchronicle all right: it will make dot-com look like a warm up for the\r\nmain show.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to create a new class of artisans who can change careers\r\nevery 10 months, inventing new jobs that hadn't been imagined a year\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a pretty unstable market,\" Suzanne said, and ate some fish.\r\n\r\n\"That's a *functional* market. Here's what I think the point of a good\r\nmarket is. In a good market, you invent something and you charge all\r\nthe market will bear for it. Someone else figures out how to do it\r\ncheaper, or decides they can do it for a slimmer margin -- not the\r\nsame thing, you know, in the first case someone is more efficient and\r\nin the second they're just less greedy or less ambitious. They do it\r\nand so you have to drop your prices to compete. Then someone comes\r\nalong who's less greedy or more efficient than both of you and\r\nundercuts you again, and again, and again, until eventually you get\r\ndown to a kind of firmament, a baseline that you can't go lower than,\r\nthe cheapest you can produce a good and stay in business. That's why\r\nstraightpins, machine screws and reams of paper all cost basically\r\nnothing, and make damned little profit for their manufacturers.\r\n\r\n\"So if you want to make a big profit, you've got to start over again,\r\ninvent something new, and milk it for all you can before the first\r\nimitator shows up. The more this happens, the cheaper and better\r\neverything gets. It's how we got here, you see. It's what the system\r\nis *for*. We're approaching a kind of pure and perfect state now, with\r\ncompetition and invention getting easier and easier -- it's producing\r\na kind of superabundance that's amazing to watch. My kids just surf\r\nit, make themselves over every six months, learn a new interface, a\r\nnew entertainment, you name it. Change-surfers...\" He trailed off.\r\n\r\n\"You have kids?\"\r\n\r\n\"In St Petersburg, with their mother.\"\r\n\r\nShe could tell by his tone that it had been the wrong question to\r\nask. He was looking hangdog. \"Well, it must be nice to be so much\r\ncloser to them than you were in Ithaca.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? No, no. The St Petersburg in *Russia*.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThey concentrated on their food for a while.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" he said, after they'd ordered coffee and desert, \"it's all\r\nabout abundance. I want my kids to grow up with abundance, and\r\nwhatever is going on right now, it's providing abundance in\r\nabundance. The self-storage industry is bigger than the recording\r\nindustry, did you know that? All they do is provide a place to put\r\nstuff that we own that we can't find room for -- that's\r\nsuperabundance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a locker in Milpitas,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"There you go. It's a growth industry.\" He drank his coffee. On the\r\nway back to their cars, he said, \"My daughter, Lyenitchka, is four,\r\nand my son, Sasha, is one. I haven't lived with their mother in three\r\nyears.\" He made a face. \"Sasha's circumstances were\r\ncomplicated. They're good kids, though. It just couldn't work with\r\ntheir mother. She's Russian, and connected -- that's how we met, I was\r\nhustling for my import-export business and she had some good\r\nconnections -- so after the divorce there was no question of my taking\r\nthe kids with me. But they're good kids.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you see them?\"\r\n\r\n\"We videoconference. Who knew that long-distance divorce was the\r\nkiller app for videoconferencing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah.\"\r\n\r\nThat week, Suzanne tweeted constantly, filed two columns, and blogged\r\nten or more items a day: photos, bits of discussion between Lester,\r\nPerry and Tjan, a couple videos of the Boogie Woogie Elmos doing\r\nimprobable things. Turned out that there was quite a cult following\r\nfor the BWE, and the news that there was a trove of some thousands of\r\nthem in a Hollywood dump sent a half-dozen pilgrims winging their way\r\nacross the nation to score some for the collectors' market. Perry\r\nwouldn't even take their money: \"Fella,\" he told one persistent\r\ndealer, \"I got forty *thousand* of these things. I won't miss a couple\r\ndozen. Just call it good karma.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Tjan found out about it he pursed his lips for a moment, then\r\nsaid, \"Let me know if someone wants to pay us money, please. I think\r\nyou were right, but I'd like to have a say, all right?\"\r\n\r\nPerry looked at Suzanne, who was videoing this exchange with her\r\nkeychain. Then he looked back at Tjan, \"Yeah, of course. Sorry --\r\nforce of habit. No harm done, though, right?\"\r\n\r\nThat footage got downloaded a couple hundred times that night, but\r\nonce it got slashdotted by a couple of high-profile headline\r\naggregators, she found her server hammered with a hundred thousand\r\nrequests. The Merc had the horsepower to serve them all, but you never\r\nknew: every once in a while, the web hit another tipping point and\r\ngrew by an order of magnitude or so, and then all the\r\nserver-provisioning -- calculated to survive the old slashdottings --\r\nshredded like wet kleenex.\r\n\r\nFrom: kettlewell-l@skunkworks.kodacell.com\r\n\r\nTo: schurch@sjmercury.com\r\n\r\nSubject: Re: Embedded journalist?\r\n\r\nThis stuff is amazing. Amazing! Christ, I should put you on the\r\npayroll. Forget I wrote that. But i should. You've got a fantastic\r\neye. I have never felt as in touch with my own business as I do at\r\nthis moment. Not to mention proud! Proud -- you've made me so proud of\r\nthe work these guys are doing, proud to have some role in it.\r\n\r\nKettlebelly\r\n\r\nShe read it sitting up in her coffin, just one of several hundred\r\nemails from that day's blog-posts and column. She laughed and dropped\r\nit in her folder of correspondence to answer. It was nearly midnight,\r\ntoo late to get into it with Kettlewell.\r\n\r\nThen her computer rang -- the net-phone she forwarded her cellphone to\r\nwhen her computer was live and connected. She'd started doing that a\r\ncouple years back, when soft-phones really stabilized, and her phone\r\nbills had dropped to less than twenty bucks a month, down from several\r\nhundred. It wasn't that she spent a lot of time within arm's reach of\r\na live computer, but given that calls routed through the laptop were\r\nfree, she was perfectly willing to defer her calls until she was.\r\n\r\n\"Hi Jimmy,\" she said -- her editor, back in San Jose. 9PM Pacific time\r\non a weeknight was still working hours for him.\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe waited. She'd half expected him to call with a little shower of\r\npraise, an echo of Kettlewell's note. Jimmy wasn't the most effusive\r\neditor she'd had, but it made his little moments of praise more\r\nvaluable for their rarity.\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne,\" he said again.\r\n\r\n\"Jimmy,\" she said. \"It's late here. What's up?\"\r\n\r\n\"So, it's like this. I love your reports but it's not Silicon Valley\r\nnews. It's Miami news. McClatchy handed me a thirty percent cut this\r\nmorning and I'm going to the bone. I am firing a third of the newsroom\r\ntoday. Now, you are a stupendous writer and so I said to myself, 'I\r\ncan fire her or I can bring her home and have her write about Silicon\r\nValley again,' and I knew what the answer had to be. So I need you to\r\ncome home, just wrap it up and come home.\"\r\n\r\nHe finished speaking and she found herself staring at her computer's\r\nscreen. Her hands were gripping the laptop's edges so tightly it hurt,\r\nand the machine made a plasticky squeak as it began to bend.\r\n\r\n\"I can't do that, Jimmy. This is stuff that Silicon Valley needs to\r\nknow about. This may not be what's happening *in* Silicon Valley, but\r\nit sure as shit is what's happening *to* Silicon Valley.\" She hated\r\nthat she'd cussed -- she hadn't meant to. \"I know you're in a hard\r\nspot, but this is the story I need to cover right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne, I'm cutting a third of the newsroom. We're going to be\r\ncovering stories within driving distance of this office for the\r\nforeseeable future, and that's it. I don't disagree with a single\r\nthing you just said, but it doesn't matter: if I leave you where you\r\nare, I'll have to cut the guy who covers the school boards and the\r\ncity councils. I can't do that, not if I want to remain a daily\r\nnewspaper editor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" she said. \"Can I think about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Think about what, Suzanne? This has not been the best day for me, I\r\nhave to tell you, but I don't see what there is to think about. This\r\nnewspaper no longer has correspondents who work in Miami and London\r\nand Paris and New York. As of today, that stuff comes from bloggers,\r\nor off the wire, or whatever -- but not from our payroll. You work for\r\nthis newspaper, so you need to come back here, because the job you're\r\ndoing does not exist any longer. The job you have with us is\r\nhere. You've missed the night-flight, but there's a direct flight\r\ntomorrow morning that'll have you back by lunchtime tomorrow, and we\r\ncan sit down together then and talk about it, all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think --\" She felt that oh-shit-oh-shit feeling again, that\r\nneeding-to-pee feeling, that tension from her toes to her\r\nnose. \"Jimmy,\" she said. \"I need a leave of absence, OK?\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Suzanne, I'm sure we owe you some vacation but now isn't the\r\ntime --\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a vacation, Jimmy. Six months leave of absence, without pay.\" Her\r\nsavings could cover it. She could put some banner ads on her\r\nblog. Florida was cheap. She could rent out her place in\r\nCalifornia. She was six steps into the plan and it had only taken ten\r\nseconds and she had no doubts whatsoever. She could talk to that\r\nbook-agent who'd pinged her last year, see about getting an advance on\r\na book about Kodacell.\r\n\r\n\"Are you quitting?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Jimmy -- well, not unless you make me. But I need to stay here.\"\r\n\r\n\"The work you're doing there is fine, Suzanne, but I worked really\r\nhard to protect your job here and this isn't going to help make that\r\nhappen.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you want to work for the Merc, you need to fly back to San Jose,\r\nwhere the Merc is published. I can't make it any clearer than that.\"\r\n\r\nNo, he couldn't. She sympathized with him. She was really well paid by\r\nthe Merc. Keeping her on would mean firing two junior writers. He'd\r\ncut her a lot of breaks along the way, too -- let her feel out the\r\nValley in her own way. It had paid off for both of them, but he'd\r\ntaken the risk when a lot of people wouldn't have. She'd be a fool to\r\nwalk away from all that.\r\n\r\nShe opened her mouth to tell him that she'd be on the plane in the\r\nmorning, and what came out was, \"Jimmy, I really appreciate all the\r\nwork you've done for me, but this is the story I need to write. I'm\r\nsorry about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Jimmy,\" she said. \"I'll get back to California when I get\r\na lull and sort out the details -- my employee card and stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what you're doing, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"I do.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she unscrewed her earpiece, she discovered that her neck was\r\nkilling her. That made her realize that she was a forty-five-year-old\r\nwoman in America without health insurance. Or regular income. She was\r\na journalist without a journalistic organ.\r\n\r\nShe'd have to tell Kettlewell, who would no doubt offer to put her on\r\nthe payroll. She couldn't do that, of course. Neutrality was hard\r\nenough to maintain, never mind being financially compromised.\r\n\r\nShe stepped out of the coffin and sniffed the salty air. Living in the\r\ncoffin was expensive. She'd need to get a condo or something. A place\r\nwith a kitchen where she could prep meals. She figured that Perry's\r\nbuilding would probably have a vacancy or two.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe second business that Tjan took Perry into was even more successful\r\nthan the first, and that was saying something. It only took a week for\r\nTjan to get Perry and Lester cranking on a Kitchen Gnome design that\r\nmashed together some Homeland Security gait-recognition software with\r\na big solid-state hard-disk and a microphone and a little camera, all\r\npackaged together in one of a couple hundred designs of a garden-gnome\r\nfigurine that stood six inches tall. It could recognize every member\r\nof a household by the way they walked and play back voice-memos for\r\neach. It turned out to be a killer tool for context-sensitive\r\nreminders to kids to do the dishes, and for husbands, wives and\r\nroommates to nag each other without getting on each others'\r\nnerves. Tjan was really jazzed about it, as it tied in with some\r\ntheories he had about the changing US demographic, trending towards\r\nblended households in urban centers, with three or more adults\r\nco-habitating.\r\n\r\n\"This is a rich vein,\" he said, rubbing his hands together. \"Living\r\ncommunally is hard, and technology can make it easier. Roommate\r\nware. It's the wave of the future.\"\r\n\r\nThere was another Kodacell group in San Francisco, a design outfit\r\nwith a bunch of stringers who could design the gnomes for them and\r\nthey did great work. The gnomes were slightly lewd-looking, and they\r\nwere the product of a generative algorithm that varied each one. Some\r\nof the designs that fell out of the algorithm were jaw-droppingly\r\nweird -- Perry kept a three-eyed, six-armed version on his desk. They\r\ntooled up to make them by the hundred, then the thousand,then the tens\r\nof thousand. The fact that each one was different kept their margins\r\nup, but as the Gnomes gained popularity their sales were steadily\r\neroded by knock-offs, mostly from Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe knockoffs weren't as cool-looking -- though they were certainly\r\nweirder looking, like the offspring of a Norwegian troll and an anime\r\nrobot -- but they were more feature-rich. Some smart hacker in Russia\r\nwas packing all kinds of functionality onto a single chip, so that\r\ntheir trolls cost less and did more: burglar alarms, baby-monitors,\r\nstreaming Internet radio source, and low-reliability medical\r\ndiagnostic that relied on quack analysis of eye pigment, tongue\r\ncoating and other newage (rhymes with sewage) indicators.\r\n\r\nLester came back from the Dollar Store with a big bag of trolls, a\r\ndozen different models, and dumped them out on Tjan's desk, up in old\r\nforeman's offices on the catwalk above the workspaces. \"Christ, would\r\nyou look at these? They're selling them for less than our cost to\r\nmanufacture. How do we compete with this?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't,\" Tjan said, and rubbed his belly. \"Now we do the next\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the next thing?\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the first one delivered a return-on-investment at about twenty\r\ntimes the rate of any Kodak or Duracell business unit in the history\r\nof either company. But I'd like to shoot for thirty to forty times\r\nnext, if that's all right with you. So let's go see what you've\r\ninvented this week and how we can commercialize it.\"\r\n\r\nPerry and Lester just looked at each other. Finally, Lester said, \"Can\r\nyou repeat that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The typical ROI for a Kodacell unit in the old days was about four\r\npercent. If you put a hundred dollars in, you'd get a hundred and four\r\ndollars out, and it would take about a year to realize. Of course, in\r\nthe old days, they wouldn't have touched a new business unless they\r\ncould put a hundred million in and get a hundred and four million\r\nout. Four million bucks is four million bucks.\r\n\r\n\"But here, the company put fifty thousand into these dolls and three\r\nmonths later, they took seventy thousand out, after paying our\r\nsalaries and bonuses. That's a forty percent ROI. Seventy thousand\r\nbucks isn't four million bucks, but forty percent is forty\r\npercent. Not to mention that our business drove similar margins in\r\nthree other business units.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought we'd screwed up by letting these guys eat our lunch,\"\r\nLester said, indicating the dollar-store trolls.\r\n\r\n\"Nope, we got in while the margins were high, made a good return, and\r\nnow we'll get out as the margins drop. That's not screwing up, that's\r\ndoing the right thing. The next time around, we'll do something more\r\ncapital intensive and we'll take out an even higher margin: so show me\r\nsomething that'll cost two hundred grand to get going and that we can\r\npull a hundred and sixty thou's worth of profit out of for Kodacell in\r\nthree months. Let's do something ambitious this time around.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne took copious notes. There'd been a couple weeks' awkwardness\r\nearly on about her scribbling as they talked, or videoing with her\r\nkeychain. But once she'd moved into the building with the guys, taking\r\na condo on the next floor up, she'd become just a member of the team,\r\nalbeit a member who tweeted nearly every word they uttered to a feed\r\nthat was adding new subscribers by the tens of thousands.\r\n\r\n\"So, Perry, what have you got for Tjan?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I came up with the last one,\" he said, grinning -- they always ended\r\nup grinning when Tjan ran down economics for them. \"Let Lester take\r\nthis one.\"\r\n\r\nLester looked shy -- he'd never fully recovered from Suzanne turning\r\nhim down and when she was in the room, he always looked like he'd\r\nrather be somewhere else. He participated in the message boards on her\r\nblog though, the most prolific poster in a field with thousands of\r\nvery prolific posters. When he posted, others listened: he was witty,\r\ncharming and always right.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've been thinking a lot about roommate-ware, 'cause I know\r\nthat Tjan's just crazy for that stuff. I've been handicapped by the\r\nfact that you guys are such excellent roomies, so I have to think back\r\nto my college days to remember what a bad roommate is like, where the\r\nfriction is. Mostly, it comes down to resource contention, though: I\r\nwanna cook, but your dishes are in the sink; I wanna do laundry but\r\nyour boxers are in the dryer; I wanna watch TV, but your crap is all\r\nover the living room sofa.\"\r\n\r\nLiving upstairs from the guys gave her fresh insight into how the\r\nKodacell philosophy would work out. Kettlewell was really big on\r\ncommunal living, putting these people into each other's pockets like\r\nthe old-time geek houses of pizza-eating hackers, getting that\r\nin-the-trenches camaraderie. It had taken a weekend to put the most\r\nprecious stuff in her California house into storage and then turn over\r\nthe keys to a realtor who'd sort out leasing it for her. The monthly\r\ncheck from the realtor left more than enough for her to pay the rent\r\nin Florida and then some, and once the UPS man dropped off the five\r\nboxes of personal effects she'd chosen, she was practically at home.\r\n\r\nShe sat alone over the guys' apartments in the evenings, windows open\r\nso that their muffled conversations could drift in and form the\r\nsoundtrack as she wrote her columns. It made her feel curiously with,\r\nbut not of, their movement -- a reasonable proxy for journalistic\r\nobjectivity in this age of relativism.\r\n\r\n\"Resource contention readily decomposes into a bunch of smaller\r\nproblems, with distinctive solutions. Take dishes: every dishwasher\r\nshould be designed with a 'clean' and a 'dirty' compartment --\r\nbasically, two logical dishwashers. You take clean dishes out of the\r\nclean side, use them, and put them into the dirty side. When the dirty\r\nside is full, the clean side is empty, so you cycle the dishwasher and\r\nthe clean side becomes dirty and vice-versa. I had some sketches for\r\ndesigns that would make this happen, but it didn't feel right: making\r\ndishwashers is too industrial for us. I either like making big chunks\r\nof art or little silver things you can carry in your pocket.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled despite herself. She was drawing a half-million readers a\r\nday by doing near-to-nothing besides repeating the mind-blowing\r\nconversations around her. It had taken her a month to consider putting\r\nads on the site -- lots of feelers from blog \"micro-labels\" who wanted\r\nto get her under management and into their banner networks, and she\r\nbroke down when one of them showed her a little spreadsheet detailing\r\nthe kind of long green she could expect to bring in from a couple of\r\nlittle banners, with her getting the right to personally approve every\r\nadvertiser in the network. The first month, she'd made more money than\r\nall but the most senior writers on the Merc. The next month, she'd\r\noutstripped her own old salary. She'd covered commercial blogs, the\r\nflamboyant attention-whores who'd bought stupid cars and ridiculous\r\nbimbos with the money, but she'd always assumed they were in a\r\ndifferent league from a newspaper scribbler. Now she supposed all the\r\nmoney meant that she should make it official and phone in a\r\nresignation to Jimmy, but they'd left it pretty ambiguous as to\r\nwhether she was retiring or taking a leave of absence and she was\r\nreluctant to collapse that waveform into the certainty of saying\r\ngoodbye to her old life.\r\n\r\n\"So I got to thinking about snitch-tags, radio frequency ID\r\ngizmos. Remember those? When we started talking about them a decade\r\nago, all the privacy people went crazy, totally sure that these things\r\nwould be bad news. The geeks dismissed them as not understanding the\r\ntechnology. Supposedly, an RFID can only be read from a couple inches\r\naway -- if someone wanted to find out what RFIDs you had on your\r\nperson, they'd have to wand you, and you'd know about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, that was bull,\" Perry said. \"I mean, sure you can't read an\r\nRFID unless it's been excited with electromagnetic radiation, and\r\n*sure* you can't do that from a hundred yards without frying\r\neverything between you and the target. But if you had a subway\r\nturnstile with an exciter built into it, you could snipe all the tag\r\nnumbers from a distant roof with a directional antenna. If those\r\nthings had caught on, there'd be exciters everywhere and you'd be able\r\nto track anyone you wanted -- Christ, they even put RFIDs in the\r\nhundred-dollar bill for a while! Pickpockets could have figured out\r\nwhose purse was worth snatching from half a mile a way!\"\r\n\r\n\"All true,\" Lester said. \"But that didn't stop these guys. There are\r\nstill a couple of them around, limping along without many\r\ncustomers. They print the tags with inkjets, sized down to about a\r\nthird the size of a grain of rice. Mostly used in supply-chain\r\nmanagement and such. They can supply them on the cheap.\r\n\r\n\"Which brings me to my idea: why not tag everything in a group\r\nhousehold, and use the tags to figure out who left the dishes in the\r\nsink, who took the hammer out and didn't put it back, who put the\r\nempty milk-carton back in the fridge, and who's got the TV remote? It\r\nwon't solve resource contention, but it will limit the social factors\r\nthat contribute to it.\" He looked around at them. \"We can make it fun,\r\nyou know, make cool RFID sticker designs, mod the little gnome dolls\r\nto act as terminals for getting reports.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne found herself nodding along. She could use this kind of thing,\r\neven though she lived alone, just to help her find out where she left\r\nher glasses and the TV remote.\r\n\r\nPerry shook his head, though. \"When I was a kid, I had a really bad\r\nrelationship with my mom. She was really smart, but she didn't have a\r\nlot of time to reason things out with me, so often as not she'd get\r\nout of arguing with me by just changing her story. So I'd say, 'Ma,\r\ncan I go to the mall this aft?' and she'd say, 'Sure, no problem.'\r\nThen when I was getting ready to leave the house, she'd ask me where I\r\nthought I was going. I'd say, 'To the mall, you said!' and she'd just\r\ndeny it. Just deny it, point blank.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think she even knew she was doing it. I think when I asked\r\nher if I could go, she'd just absentmindedly say yes, but when it\r\nactually came time to go out, she'd suddenly remember all my\r\nunfinished chores, my homework, all the reasons I should stay home. I\r\nthink every kid gets this from their folks, but it made me fucking\r\ncrazy. So I got a mini tape recorder and I started to *tape* her when\r\nshe gave me permission. I thought I'd really nail her the next time\r\nshe changed her tune, play her own words back in her ear.\r\n\r\n\"So I tried it, and you know what happened? She gave me nine kinds of\r\nholy hell for wearing a wire and then she said it didn't matter what\r\nshe'd said that morning, she was my mother and I had chores to do and\r\nno *how* was I going *anywhere* now that I'd started sneaking around\r\nthe house with a hidden recorder. She took it away and threw it in the\r\ntrash. And to top it off, she called me 'J. Edgar' for a month.\r\n\r\n\"So here's my question: how would you feel if the next time you left\r\nthe dishes in the sink, I showed up with the audit trail for the\r\ndishes and waved it in your face? How would we get from that point to\r\na happy, harmonious household? I think you've mistaken the cause for\r\nthe effect. The problem with dishes in the sink isn't just that it's a\r\npain when I want to cook a meal: it's that when you leave them in the\r\nsink, you're being inconsiderate. And the *reason* you've left them in\r\nthe sink, as you've pointed out, is that putting dishes in the\r\ndishwasher is a pain in the ass: you have to bend over, you have to\r\nempty it out, and so on. If we moved the dishwasher into the kitchen\r\ncupboards and turned half of them into a dirty side and half into a\r\nclean side, then disposing of dishes would be as easy as getting them\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nLester laughed, and so did Tjan. \"Yeah, yeah -- OK. Point taken. But\r\nthese RFID things, they're so frigging cheap and potentially useful. I\r\njust can't believe that they've never found a single really compelling\r\nuse in all this time. It just seems like an opportunity that's going\r\nto waste.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe it's a dead end. Maybe it's an ornithopter. Inventors spent\r\nhundreds of years trying to build an airplane that flew by flapping\r\nits wings, and it was all a rat-hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess,\" Lester said. \"But I don't like the idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like it or don't, \" Perry said, \"doesn't affect whether it's true or\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nBut Lester had a sparkle in his eye, and he disappeared into his\r\nworkshop for a week, and wouldn't let them in, which was unheard of\r\nfor the big, gregarious giant. He liked to drag the others in whenever\r\nhe accomplished anything of note, show it off to them like a big kid.\r\n\r\nThat was Sunday. Monday, Suzanne got a call from her realtor. \"Your\r\ntenants have vanished,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Vanished?\" The couple who'd rented her place had been as reliable as\r\nanyone she'd ever met in the Valley. He worked at a PR agency, she\r\nworked in marketing at Google. Or maybe he worked in marketing and she\r\nwas in PR at Google -- whatever, they were affluent, well-spoken, and\r\nhad paid the extortionate rent she'd charged without batting an eye.\r\n\r\n\"They normally paypal the rent to me on the first, but not this\r\nmonth. I called and left voicemail the next day, then followed up with\r\nan email. Yesterday I went by the house and it was empty. All their\r\nstuff was gone. No food in the fridge. I think they might have taken\r\nyour home theater stuff, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're fucking kidding me,\" Suzanne said. It was 11AM in Florida and\r\nshe was into her second glass of lemonade as the sun began to\r\nsuperheat the air. Back in California, it was 8AM. Her realtor was\r\npulling long hours, and it wasn't her fault. \"Sorry. Right. OK, what\r\nabout the deposit?\"\r\n\r\n\"You waived it.\"\r\n\r\nShe had. It hadn't seemed like a big deal at the time. The distant\r\nowner of the condo she was renting in Florida hadn't asked for\r\none. \"So I did. Now what?\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to swear out a complaint against them?\"\r\n\r\n\"With the police?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. Breach of contract. Theft, if they took the home theater. We\r\ncan take them to collections, too.\"\r\n\r\nGoddamned marketing people had the collective morals of a snake. All\r\nof them useless, conniving, shallow -- she never should have...\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, OK. And what about the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can find you another tenant by the end of the month, I'm\r\nsure. Maybe a little earlier. Have you thought any more about selling\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nShe hadn't, though the realtor brought it up every time they\r\nspoke. \"Is now a good time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lot of new millionaires in the Valley shopping for houses,\r\nSuzanne. More than I've seen in years.\" She named a sum that was a\r\nthird higher than the last time they'd talked it over.\r\n\r\n\"Is it peaking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? It might go up, it might collapse again. But now is the\r\nbest time to sell in the past ten years. You'd be smart to do it.\"\r\n\r\nShe took a deep breath. The Valley was dead, full of venal marketing\r\npeople and buck-chasers. Here in Florida, she was on the cusp of the\r\nnext thing, and it wasn't happening in the Valley: it was happening\r\neverywhere *except* the Valley, in the cheap places where innovation\r\ncould happen at low rents. Leaky hot tub, incredible property taxes,\r\nand the crazy roller-coaster ride -- up 20 percent this month, down\r\nforty next. The bubble was going to burst some day and she should sell\r\nout now.\r\n\r\n\"Sell it,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"You're going to be a wealthy lady,\" the realtor said.\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" Suzanne said.\r\n\r\n\"I have a buyer, Suzanne. I didn't want to pressure you. But I can\r\nsell it by Friday. Close escrow next week. Cash in hand by the\r\nfifteenth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus,\" she said. \"You're joking.\"\r\n\r\n\"No joke,\" the realtor said. \"I've got a waiting list for houses on\r\nyour block.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so Suzanne got on an airplane that night and flew back to San Jose\r\nand took a pricey taxi back to her place. The marketdroids had left it\r\nin pretty good shape, clean and tidy, clean sheets in the linen\r\ncupboard. She made up her bed and reflected that this would be the\r\nlast time she made this bed -- the next time she stripped the sheets,\r\nthey'd go into a long-term storage box. She'd done this before, on her\r\nway out of Detroit, packing up a life into boxes and shoving it into\r\nstorage. What had Tjan said? \"The self-storage industry is bigger than\r\nthe recording industry, did you know that? All they do is provide a\r\nplace to put stuff that we own that we can't find room for -- that's\r\nsuperabundance.\"\r\n\r\nBefore bed she posted a classified on Craigslist for a couple helpers\r\nto work on boxing stuff, emailed Jimmy to see if he wanted lunch, and\r\nlooked up the address for the central police station to swear out her\r\ncomplaint. The amp, speakers, and A/V switcher were all missing from\r\nher home theater.\r\n\r\nShe had a dozen helpers to choose from the next morning. She picked\r\ntwo who came with decent references, marveling that it was suddenly\r\npossible in Silicon Valley to get anyone to show up anywhere for ten\r\nbucks an hour. The police sergeant who took the complaint was\r\nsympathetic and agreed with her choice to get out of town. \"I've had\r\nit with this place, too. Soon as my kids are out of high-school I'm\r\nmoving back to Montana. I miss the weather.\"\r\n\r\nShe didn't think of the marketdroids again until the next day, when\r\nshe and her helpers were boxing up the last of her things and loading\r\nthem into her U-Haul. Then a BMW convertible screeched around the\r\ncorner and burned rubber up to her door.\r\n\r\nThe woman marketdroid was driving, looking crazy and disheveled, eyes\r\nred-rimmed, one heel broken off of her shoes.\r\n\r\n\"What the FUCK is your problem, lady?\" she said, as she leapt out of\r\nher car and stalked toward Suzanne.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, Suzanne shrank back and dropped the box of books she\r\nwas holding. It spilled out over her lawn.\r\n\r\n\"Fiona?\" she said. \"What's happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was *arrested.* They came to my workplace and led me out in\r\nhandcuffs. I had to make *bail*.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne's stomach shrank to a little pebble, impossibly heavy. \"What\r\nwas I supposed to do? You two took off with my home theater!\"\r\n\r\n\"What home theater? Everything was right where you left it when I\r\nwent. I haven't lived here in *weeks*. Tom left me last month and I\r\nmoved out.\"\r\n\r\n\"You moved out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, bitch, I *moved out*. Tom was your tenant, not me. If he ripped\r\nsomething off, that's between you and him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look, Fiona, wait, hold up a second. I tried to call you, I sent you\r\nemail. No one was paying the rent, no one told me that you'd moved\r\nout, and no one answered when I tried to find out what had happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds like an *explanation,* she said, hissing. \"I'm waiting\r\nfor a fucking *apology.* They took me to *prison*.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne knew that the local lockup was a long way from prison. \"I\r\napologize,\" she said. \"Can I get you a cup of coffee? Would you like\r\nto use the shower or anything?\"\r\n\r\nThe woman glared at her a moment longer, then slowly folded in on\r\nherself, collapsing, coughing and sobbing on the lawn.\r\n\r\nSuzanne stood with her arms at her sides for a moment. Her Craigslist\r\nhelpers had gone home, so she was all alone, and this woman, whom\r\nshe'd met only once before, in passing, was clearly having some real\r\nproblems. Not the kind of thing she dealt with a lot -- her life\r\ndidn't include much person-to-person hand-holding.\r\n\r\nBut what can you do? She knelt beside Fiona in the grass and took her\r\nhand. \"Let's get you inside, OK?\"\r\n\r\nAt first it was as though she hadn't heard, but slowly she\r\nstraightened up and let Suzanne lead her into the house. She was\r\ntwenty-two, twenty-three, young enough to be Suzanne's daughter if\r\nSuzanne had gone in for that sort of thing. Suzanne helped her to the\r\nsofa and sat her down amid the boxes still waiting to go into the\r\nU-Haul. The kitchen was packed up, but she had a couple bottles of\r\nDiet Coke in the cooler and she handed one to the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I'm really sorry, Fiona. Why didn't you answer my calls or email?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at Suzanne, her eyes lost in streaks of mascara. \"I don't\r\nknow. I didn't want to talk about it. He lost his job last month and\r\nkind of went crazy, told me he didn't want the responsibility\r\nanymore. What responsibility? But he told me to go, told me it would\r\nbe best for both of us if we were apart. I thought it was another\r\ngirl, but I don't know. Maybe it was just craziness. Everyone I know\r\nout here is crazy. They all work a hundred hours a week, they get\r\nfired or quit their jobs every five months. Everything is so\r\nexpensive. My rent is three quarters of my salary.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's really hard,\" Suzanne said, thinking of the easy, lazy days in\r\nFlorida, the hackers' idyll that Perry and Lester enjoyed in their\r\nworkshops.\r\n\r\n\"Tom was on antidepressants, but he didn't like taking them. When he\r\nwas on them, he was pretty good, but when he went off, he turned\r\ninto... I don't know. He'd cry a lot, and shout. It wasn't a good\r\nrelationship, but we moved out here from Oregon together, and I'd\r\nknown him all my life. He was a little moody before, but not like he\r\nwas here.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you speak to him last?\" Suzanne had found a couple of\r\nblister-packs of anti-depressants in the medicine chest. She hoped\r\nthat wasn't Tom's only supply.\r\n\r\n\"We haven't spoken since I moved out.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later, the mystery was solved. The police went to Tom's\r\nworkplace and discovered that he'd been fired the week before. They\r\ntried the GPS in his car and it finked him out as being in a ghost\r\nmall's parking lot near his old office. He was dead behind the wheel,\r\na gun in his hand, shot through the heart.\r\n\r\nSuzanne took the call and though she tried to keep her end of the\r\nconversation quiet and neutral, Fiona -- still on the sofa, drinking\r\nthe warm, flat Coke -- knew. She let out a moan like a dog that's been\r\nkicked, and then a scream. For Suzanne, it was all unreal,\r\nsenseless. The cops told her that her home theater components were\r\nfound in the trunk of the car. No note.\r\n\r\n\"God, oh God, Jesus, you selfish shit fucking bastard,\" Fiona\r\nsobbed. Awkwardly, Suzanne sat down beside her and took her into a\r\none-armed hug. Her helpers were meeting her at the self-storage the\r\nnext day to help her unload the U-Haul.\r\n\r\n\"Do you have someone who can stay with you tonight?\" Suzanne asked,\r\npraying the answer was yes. She had a house to move out of. Christ,\r\nshe felt so cold-blooded, but she was on a goddamned schedule.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I guess.\" Fiona scrubbed at her eyes with her fists. \"Sure.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne sighed. The lie was plain. \"Who?\"\r\n\r\nFiona stood up and smoothed out her skirt. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, and\r\nstarted for the door.\r\n\r\nGroaning inwardly, Suzanne blocked her. \"You'll stay on the sofa,\" she\r\nsaid. \"You're not driving in this state. I'll order in\r\npizza. Pepperoni mushroom OK?\"\r\n\r\nLooking defeated, Fiona turned on her heel and went back to the sofa.\r\n\r\nOver pizza, Suzanne pulled a few details out of her. Tom had fallen\r\ninto a funk when the layoffs had started in his office -- they were\r\nendemic across the Valley, another bust was upon them. His behavior\r\nhad grown worse and worse, and she'd finally left, or been thrown out,\r\nit wasn't clear. She was on thin ice at Google, and they were laying\r\npeople off too, and she was convinced that being led out in handcuffs\r\nwould be the straw that broke the camel's back.\r\n\r\n\"I should move back to Oregon,\" she said, dropping her slice back on\r\nthe box-top.\r\n\r\nSuzanne had heard a lot of people talk about giving up on the Valley\r\nsince she'd moved there. It was a common thing, being beaten down by\r\nlife in the Bay Area. You were supposed to insert a pep talk here,\r\nsomething about hanging in, about the opportunities here.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"that's a good idea. You're young, and there's a life\r\nfor you there. You can start something up, or go to work for someone\r\nelse's startup.\" It felt weird coming out of her mouth, like a\r\nbetrayal of the Valley, of some tribal loyalty to this tech-Mecca. But\r\nafter all, wasn't she selling up and moving east?\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing in Oregon,\" Fiona said, snuffling.\r\n\r\n\"There's something everywhere. Let me tell you about some friends of\r\nmine in Florida,\" and she told her, and as she told her, she told\r\nherself. Hearing it spoken aloud, even after having written about it\r\nand written about it, and been there and DONE it, it was\r\ndifferent. She came to understand how fucking *cool* it all was, this\r\nnew, entrepreneurial, inventive, amazing thing she was engaged\r\nin. She'd loved the contrast of nimble software companies when\r\ncompared with gigantic, brutal auto companies, but what her boys were\r\ndoing, it made the software companies look like lumbering lummoxes,\r\ncrashing around with their fifty employees and their big purpose-built\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nFiona was disbelieving, then interested, then excited. \"They just make\r\nthis stuff, do it, then make something else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly -- no permanence except for the team, and they support each\r\nother, live and work together. You'd think that because they live and\r\nwork together that they don't have any balance, but it's the opposite:\r\nthey book off work at four or sometimes earlier, go to movies, go out\r\nand have fun, read books, play catch. It's amazing. I'm never coming\r\nback here.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she never would.\r\n\r\nShe told her editor about this. She told her friends who came to a\r\nsend-off party at a bar she used to go to when she went into the\r\noffice a lot. She told her cab driver who picked her up to take her to\r\nthe airport and she told the bemused engineer who sat next to her all\r\nthe way back to Miami. She had the presence of mind not to tell the\r\ncouple who bought her house for a sum of money that seemed to have at\r\nleast one extra zero at the end -- maybe two.\r\n\r\nAnd so when she got back to Miami, she hardly noticed the incredible\r\nobesity of the man who took the money for the gas in her leased car --\r\nnow that she was here for the long haul she'd have to look into\r\ngetting Lester to help her buy a used Smart-car from a junker lot --\r\nand the tin roofs of the shantytowns she passed looked tropical and\r\nquaint. The smell of swamp and salt, the pea-soup humidity, the bass\r\nthunder of the boom-cars in the traffic around her -- it was like some\r\nkind of sweet homecoming for her.\r\n\r\nTjan was in the condo when she got home and he spotted her from the\r\nbalcony, where he'd been sunning himself and helped her bring up her\r\nsuitcases of things she couldn't bear to put in storage.\r\n\r\n\"Come down to our place for a cup of coffee once you're settled in,\"\r\nhe said, leaving her. She sluiced off the airplane grease that had\r\nfilled her pores on the long flight from San Jose to Miami and changed\r\ninto a cheap sun-dress and a pair of flip-flops that she'd bought at\r\nthe Thunderbird Flea Market and headed down to their place.\r\n\r\nTjan opened the door with a flourish and she stepped in and stopped\r\nshort. When she'd left, the place had been a reflection of their\r\njumbled lives: gizmos, dishes, parts, tools and clothes strewn\r\neverywhere in a kind of joyful, eye-watering hyper-mess, like an\r\nenormous kitchen junk-drawer.\r\n\r\nNow the place was *spotless* -- and what's more, it was\r\n*minimalist*. The floor was not only clean, it was visible. Lining the\r\nwalls were translucent white plastic tubs stacked to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"You like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's amazing,\" she said. \"Like Ikea meets *Barbarella*. What happened\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\nTjan did a little two-step. \"It was Lester's idea. Have a look in the\r\nboxes.\"\r\n\r\nShe pulled a couple of the tubs out. They were jam-packed with books,\r\ntools, cruft and crud -- all the crap that had previously cluttered\r\nthe shelves and the floor and the sofa and the coffee table.\r\n\r\n\"Watch this,\" he said. He unvelcroed a wireless keyboard from the side\r\nof the TV and began to type: T-H-E C-O. . . The field autocompleted\r\nitself: THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, and brought up a picture of a\r\nbeaten-up paperback along with links to web-stores, reviews, and the\r\nfull text. Tjan gestured with his chin and she saw that the front of\r\none of the tubs was pulsing with a soft blue glow. Tjan went and\r\npulled open the tub and fished for a second before producing the book.\r\n\r\n\"Try it,\" he said, handing her the keyboard. She began to type\r\nexperimentally: U-N and up came UNDERWEAR (14). \"No way,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Way,\" Tjan said, and hit return, bringing up a thumbnail gallery of\r\nfourteen pairs of underwear. He tabbed over each, picked out a pair of\r\nSimpsons boxers, and hit return. A different tub started glowing.\r\n\r\n\"Lester finally found a socially beneficial use for RFIDs. We're going\r\nto get rich!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I understand,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" he said. \"Let's get to the junkyard. Lester explains this\r\nreally well.\"\r\n\r\nHe did, too, losing all of the shyness she remembered, his eyes\r\nglowing, his sausage-thick fingers dancing.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever alphabetized your hard drive? I mean, have you ever\r\nspent any time concerning yourself with where on your hard drive your\r\nfiles are stored, which sectors contain which files? Computers\r\nabstract away the tedious, physical properties of files and leave us\r\nwith handles that we use to persistently refer to them, regardless of\r\nwhich part of the hard drive currently holds those particular bits. So\r\nI thought, with RFIDs, you could do this with the real world, just tag\r\neverything and have your furniture keep track of where it is.\r\n\r\n\"One of the big barriers to roommate harmony is the correct\r\ndisposition of stuff. When you leave your book on the sofa, I have to\r\nmove it before I can sit down and watch TV. Then you come after me and\r\nask me where I put your book. Then we have a fight. There's stuff that\r\nyou don't know where it goes, and stuff that you don't know where it's\r\nbeen put, and stuff that has nowhere to put it. But with tags and a\r\nsmart chest of drawers, you can just put your stuff wherever there's\r\nroom and ask the physical space to keep track of what's where from\r\nmoment to moment.\r\n\r\n\"There's still the problem of getting everything tagged and described,\r\nbut that's a service business opportunity, and where you've got other\r\nshared identifiers like ISBNs you could use a cameraphone to snap the\r\nbar-codes and look them up against public databases. The whole thing\r\ncould be coordinated around 'spring cleaning' events where you go\r\nthrough your stuff and photograph it, tag it, describe it -- good for\r\nyour insurance and for forensics if you get robbed, too.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped and beamed, folding his fingers over his belly. \"So, that's\r\nit, basically.\"\r\n\r\nPerry slapped him on the shoulder and Tjan drummed his forefingers\r\nlike a heavy-metal drummer on the side of the workbench they were\r\ngathered around.\r\n\r\nThey were all waiting for her. \"Well, it's very cool,\" she said, at\r\nlast. \"But, the whole white-plastic-tub thing. It makes your apartment\r\nlook like an Ikea showroom. Kind of inhumanly minimalist. We're\r\nAmericans, we like celebrating our stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, OK, fair enough,\" Lester said, nodding. \"You don't have to put\r\neverything away, of course. And you can still have all the decor you\r\nwant. This is about clutter control.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" Perry said. \"Come check out Lester's lab.\"\r\n\r\n\"OK, this is pretty perfect,\" Suzanne said. The clutter was gone,\r\ndisappeared into the white tubs that were stacked high on every shelf,\r\nleaving the work-surfaces clear. But Lester's works-in-progress, his\r\nkeepsakes, his sculptures and triptychs were still out, looking like\r\nvenerated museum pieces in the stark tidiness that prevailed\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nTjan took her through the spreadsheets. \"There are ten teams that do\r\ncloset-organizing in the network, and a bunch of shippers, packers,\r\nmovers, and storage experts. A few furniture companies. We adopted the\r\ninterface from some free software inventory-management apps that were\r\nbuilt for illiterate service employees. Lots of big pictures and\r\nautocompletion. And we've bought a hundred RFID printers from a\r\ncompany that was so grateful for a new customer that they're shipping\r\nus 150 of them, so we can print these things at about a million per\r\nhour. The plan is to start our sales through the consultants at the\r\nsame time as we start showing at trade-shows for furniture\r\ncompanies. We've already got a huge order from a couple of local\r\nold-folks' homes.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked to the IHOP to have a celebratory lunch. Being back in\r\nFlorida felt just right to her. Francis, the leader of the\r\nparamilitary wing of the AARP, threw them a salute and blew her a\r\nkiss, and even Lester's nursing junkie friend seemed to be in a good\r\nmood.\r\n\r\nWhen they were done, they brought take-out bags for the junkie and\r\nFrancis in the shantytown.\r\n\r\n\"I want to make some technology for those guys,\" Perry said as they\r\nsat in front of Francis's RV drinking cowboy coffee cooked over a\r\nbanked wood-stove off to one side. \"Room-mate-ware for homeless\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis uncrossed his bony ankles and scratched at his mosquito\r\nbites. \"A lot of people think that we don't buy stuff, but it's not\r\ntrue,\" he said. \"I shop hard for bargains, but there's lots of stuff I\r\nspend more on because of my lifestyle than I would if I had a real\r\nhouse and steady electricity. When I had a chest-freezer, I could bulk\r\nbuy ground round for about a tenth of what I pay now when I go to the\r\ngrocery store and get enough for one night's dinner. The alternative\r\nis using propane to keep the fridge going overnight, and that's not\r\ncheap, either. So I'm a kind of premium customer. Back at Boeing, we\r\nloved the people who made small orders, because we could charge them\r\nsuch a premium for custom work, while the big airlines wanted stuff\r\ndone so cheap that half the time we lost money on the deal.\"\r\n\r\nPerry nodded. \"There you have it -- roommate-ware for homeless people,\r\na great and untapped market.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne cocked her head and looked at him. \"You're sounding awfully\r\ncommerce-oriented for a pure and unsullied engineer, you know?\"\r\n\r\nHe ducked his head and grinned and looked about twelve years\r\nold. \"It's infectious. Those little kitchen gnomes, we sold nearly a\r\nhalf-million of those things, not to mention all the spin-offs. That's\r\na half-million *lives* -- a half-million *households* -- that we\r\nchanged just by thinking up something cool and making it real. These\r\nRFID things of Lester's -- we'll sign a couple million customers with\r\nthose. People will change everything about how they live from moment\r\nto moment because of something Lester thought up in my junkyard over\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's thirty million of us living in what the social workers\r\ncall 'marginal housing,'\" Francis said, grinning wryly. He had a funny\r\nsmile that Suzanne had found adorable until he explained that he had\r\nan untreated dental abscess that he couldn't afford to get fixed. \"So\r\nthat's a lot of difference you could make.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Perry said. \"Yeah, it sure is.\"\r\n\r\nThat night, she found herself still blogging and answering emails --\r\nthey always piled up when she travelled and took a couple of late\r\nnights to clear out -- after nine PM, sitting alone in a pool of light\r\nin the back corner of Lester's workshop that she had staked out as her\r\noffice. She yawned and stretched and listened to her old back\r\ncrackle. She hated feeling old, and late nights made her feel old --\r\nfeel every extra ounce of fat on her tummy, feel the lines bracketing\r\nher mouth and the little bag of skin under her chin.\r\n\r\nShe stood up and pulled on a light jacket and began to switch off\r\nlights and get ready to head home. As she poked her head in Tjan's\r\noffice, she saw that she wasn't the only one working late.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, you,\" she said. \"Isn't it time you got going?\"\r\n\r\nHe jumped like he'd been stuck with a pin and gave a little\r\nyelp. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"didn't hear you.\"\r\n\r\nHe had a cardboard box on his desk and had been filling it with his\r\npersonal effects -- little one-off inventions the guys had made for\r\nhim, personal fetishes and tchotchkes, a framed picture of his kids.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\"\r\n\r\nHe sighed and cracked his knuckles. \"Might as well tell you now as\r\ntomorrow morning. I'm resigning.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt a flash of anger and then forced it down and forcibly\r\nreplaced it with professional distance and curiosity. Mentally she\r\nlicked her pencil-tip and flipped to a blank page in her reporter's\r\nnotebook.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've had another offer, in Westchester County. Westinghouse has spun\r\nout its own version of Kodacell and they're looking for a new\r\nvice-president to run the division. That's me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good job,\" she said. \"Congratulations, Mr Vice-President.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"I emailed Kettlewell half an hour ago. I'm leaving\r\nin the morning. I'm going to say goodbye to the guys over breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much notice,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Nope,\" he said, a note of anger creeping into his voice. \"My contract\r\nlets Kodacell fire me on one day's notice, so I insisted on the right\r\nto quit on the same terms. Maybe Kettlewell will get his lawyers to\r\nwrite better boilerplate from here on in.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she had an angry interview, she habitually changed the subject to\r\nsomething sensitive: angry people often say more than they intend\r\nto. She did it instinctively, not really meaning to psy-ops Tjan, whom\r\nshe thought of as a friend, but not letting that get in the way of the\r\nstory. \"Westinghouse is doing what, exactly?\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll be as big as Kodacell's operation in a year,\" he said. \"George\r\nWestinghouse personally funded Tesla's research, you know. The company\r\nunderstands funding individual entrepreneurs. I'm going to be training\r\nthe talent scouts and mentoring the financial people, then turning\r\nthem loose to sign up entrepreneurs for the Westinghouse\r\nnetwork. There's a competitive market for garage inventors now.\" He\r\nlaughed. \"Go ahead and print that,\" he said. \"Blog it tonight. There's\r\ncompetition now. We're giving two points more equity and charging half\r\na point less on equity than the Kodacell network.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's amazing, Tjan. I hope you'll keep in touch with me -- I'd love\r\nto follow your story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count on it,\" he said. He laughed. \"I'm getting a week off every\r\neight weeks to scout Russia. They've got an incredible culture of\r\nentrepreneurship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plus you'll get to see your kids,\" Suzanne said. \"That's really\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plus, I'll get to see my kids,\" he admitted.\r\n\r\n\"How much money is Westinghouse putting into the project?\" she asked,\r\nreplacing her notional notebook with a real one, pulled from her\r\npurse.\r\n\r\n\"I don't have numbers, but they've shut down the whole appliances\r\ndivision to clear the budget for it.\" She nodded -- she'd seen news of\r\nthe layoffs on the wires. Mass demonstrations, people out of work\r\nafter twenty years' service. \"So it's a big budget.\"\r\n\r\n\"They must have been impressed with the quarterlies from Kodacell.\"\r\n\r\nTjan folded down the flaps on his box and drummed his fingers on it,\r\nsquinting at her. \"You're joking, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne, they were impressed by *you*. Everyone knows that quarterly\r\nnumbers are easy to cook -- anything less than two annual reports is\r\nas likely to be enronning as real fortune-making. But *your*\r\ndispatches from here -- they're what sold them. It's what's convincing\r\n*everyone*. Kettlewell said that three quarters of his new recruits\r\ncome on board after reading your descriptions of this place. That's\r\nhow *I* ended up here.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"That's very flattering, Tjan, but --\"\r\n\r\nHe waved her off and then, surprisingly, came around the desk and\r\nhugged her. \"But nothing, Suzanne. Kettlewell, Lester, Perry --\r\nthey're all basically big kids. Full of enthusiasm and invention, but\r\nthey've got the emotional maturity and sense of scale of hyperactive\r\nfive year olds. You and me, we're grownups. People take us\r\nseriously. It's easy to get a kid excited, but when a grownup chimes\r\nin you know there's some there there.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne recovered herself after a second and put away her\r\nnotepad. \"I'm just the person who writes it all down. You people are\r\nmaking it happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"In ten years' time, they'll remember you and not us,\" Tjan said. \"You\r\nshould get Kettlewell to put you on the payroll.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell himself turned up the next day. Suzanne had developed an\r\nintuitive sense of the flight-times from the west coast and so for a\r\nsecond she couldn't figure out how he could possibly be standing there\r\n-- nothing in the sky could get him from San Jose to Miami for a seven\r\nAM arrival.\r\n\r\n\"Private jet,\" he said, and had the grace to look slightly\r\nembarrassed. \"Kodak had eight of them and Duracell had five. We've\r\nbeen trying to sell them all off but no one wants a used jet these\r\ndays, not even Saudi princes or Columbian drug-lords.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, basically, it was going to waste.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled and looked eighteen -- she really did feel like the only\r\ngrownup sometimes -- and said, \"Zackly -- it's practically\r\nenvironmental. Where's Tjan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Downstairs saying goodbye to the guys, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" he said. \"Are you coming?\"\r\n\r\nShe grabbed her notebook and a pen and beat him out the door of her\r\nrented condo.\r\n\r\n\"What's this all about,\" Tjan said, looking wary. The guys were\r\nhang-dog and curious looking, slightly in awe of Kettlewell, who did\r\nlittle to put them at their ease -- he was staring intensely at Tjan.\r\n\r\n\"Exit interview,\" he said. \"Company policy.\"\r\n\r\nTjan rolled his eyes. \"Come on,\" he said. \"I've got a flight to catch\r\nin an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could give you a lift,\" Kettlewell said.\r\n\r\n\"You want to do the exit interview between here and the airport?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could give you a lift to JFK. I've got the jet warmed up and\r\nwaiting.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes, Suzanne managed to forget that Kodacell was a multi-billion\r\ndollar operation and that Kettlewell was at its helm, but other times\r\nthe point was very clear.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" he said, \"we'll make a day of it. We can stop on the way\r\nand pick up some barbecue to eat on the plane. I'll even let you keep\r\nyour seat in the reclining position during take-off and landing. Hell,\r\nyou can turn your cell-phone on -- just don't tell the Transport\r\nSecurity Administration!\"\r\n\r\nTjan looked cornered, then resigned. \"Sounds good to me,\" he said and\r\nKettlewell shouldered one of the two huge duffel-bags that were\r\nsitting by the door.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Kettlewell,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\nKettlewell set down the duffel. \"Sorry, sorry. Lester, Perry, it's\r\nreally good to see you. I'll bring Suzanne back tonight and we'll all\r\ngo out for dinner, OK?\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne blinked. \"I'm coming along?\"\r\n\r\n\"I sure hope so,\" Kettlewell said.\r\n\r\nPerry and Lester accompanied them down in the elevator.\r\n\r\n\"Private jet, huh?\" Perry said. \"Never been in one of those.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell told them about his adventures trying to sell off\r\nKodacell's private air force.\r\n\r\n\"Send one of them our way, then,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"Do you fly?\" Kettlewell said.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Perry said. \"Lester wants to take it apart. Right, Les?\"\r\n\r\nLester nodded. \"Lots of cool junk in a private jet.\"\r\n\r\n\"These things are worth millions, guys,\" Kettlewell said.\r\n\r\n\"No, someone *paid* millions for them,\" Perry said. \"They're *worth*\r\nwhatever you can sell them for.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell laughed. \"You've had an influence around here, Tjan,\" he\r\nsaid. Tjan managed a small, tight smile.\r\n\r\nKettlewell had a driver waiting outside of the building who loaded the\r\nduffels into the spacious trunk of a spotless dark town-car whose\r\ndoors chunked shut with an expensive sound.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to know that I'm really not angry at all, OK?\" Kettlewell\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nTjan nodded. He had the look of a man who was steeling himself for a\r\nturn in an interrogation chamber. He'd barely said a word since\r\nKettlewell arrived. For his part, Kettlewell appeared oblivious to all\r\nof this, though Suzanne was pretty sure that he understood exactly how\r\nuncomfortable this was making Tjan.\r\n\r\n\"The thing is, six months ago, nearly everyone was convinced that I\r\nwas a fucking moron, that I was about to piss away ten billion dollars\r\nof other people's money on a stupid doomed idea. Now they're copying\r\nme and poaching my best people. So this is good news for me, though\r\nI'm going to have to find a new business manager for those two before\r\nthey get picked up for turning planes into component pieces.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne's PDA vibrated whenever the number of online news stories\r\nmentioning her or Kodacell or Kettlewell increased or decreased\r\nsharply. She used to try to read everything, but it was impossible to\r\nkeep up -- now all she wanted was to keep track of whether the\r\ninterestingness-index was on the uptick or downtick.\r\n\r\nIt had started to buzz that morning and the pitch had increased\r\nsteadily until it was actually uncomfortable in her pocket. Irritated,\r\nshe yanked it out and was about to switch it off when the lead article\r\ncaught her eye.\r\n\r\nKODACELL LOSES TJAN TO WESTINGHOUSE\r\n\r\nThe by-line was Freddy. Feeling like a character in a horror movie who\r\ncan't resist the compulsion to look under the bed, Suzanne thumbed the\r\nPDA's wheel and brought up the whole article.\r\n\r\n:: Kodacell business-manager Tjan Lee Tang, whose adventures we've ::\r\nfollowed through Suzanne Church's gushing, besotted blog posts\r\n\r\nShe looked away and reflexively reached toward the delete button. The\r\ninnuendo that she was romantically involved with one or more of the\r\nguys had circulated on her blog's message boards and around the\r\ndiggdots ever since she'd started writing about them. No woman could\r\npossibly be writing about this stuff because it was important -- she\r\nhad to be \"with the band,\" a groupie or a whore.\r\n\r\nCombine that with Rat-Toothed Freddy's sneering tone and she was\r\ninstantly sent into heart-thundering rage. She deleted the post and\r\nlooked out the window. Her pager buzzed some more and she looked\r\ndown. The same article, being picked up on blogs, on some of the\r\nbigger diggdots, and an AP wire.\r\n\r\nShe forced herself to re-open it.\r\n\r\n:: has been hired to head up a new business unit on behalf of the ::\r\nmultinational giant Westinghouse. The appointment stands as more ::\r\nproof of Church's power to cloud men's minds with pretty empty ::\r\nwords about the half-baked dot-com schemes that have oozed out of ::\r\nSilicon Valley and into every empty and dead American suburb.\r\n\r\nIt was hypnotic, like staring into the eyes of a serpent. Her pulse\r\nactually thudded in her ears for a second before she took a few deep\r\nbreaths and calmed down enough to finish the article, which was just\r\nmore of the same: nasty personal attacks, sniping, and\r\ninnuendo. Freddy even managed to imply that she was screwing all of\r\nthem -- and Kettlewell besides.\r\n\r\nKettlewell leaned over her shoulder and read.\r\n\r\n\"You should send him an email,\" he said. \"That's disgusting. That's\r\nnot reportage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never get into a pissing match with a skunk,\" she said. \"What Freddy\r\nwants is for me to send him mail that he can publish along with more\r\nsnarky commentary. When the guy you're arguing with controls the venue\r\nyou're arguing in, you can't possibly win.\"\r\n\r\n\"So blog him,\" Kettlewell said. \"Correct the record.\"\r\n\r\n\"The record is correct,\" she said. \"It's never been incorrect. I've\r\nwritten an exhaustive record that is there for everyone to see. If\r\npeople believe this, no amount of correction will help.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell made a face like a little boy who'd been told he couldn't\r\nhave a toy. \"That guy is poison,\" he said. \"Those quote-marks around\r\nblog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him add his quote-marks,\" she said. \"My daily readership is\r\nhigher than the Merc's paid circulation this week.\" It was true. After\r\na short uphill climb from her new URL, she'd accumulated enough\r\nreaders that the advertising revenue dwarfed her old salary at the\r\nMerc, an astonishing happenstance that nevertheless kept her\r\nbank-account full. She clicked a little. \"Besides, look at this, there\r\nare three dozen links pointing at this story so far and all of them\r\nare critical of him. We don't need to stick up for ourselves -- the\r\nworld will.\"\r\n\r\nSaying it calmed her and now they were at the airport. They cruised\r\ninto a private gate, away from the militarized gulag that fronted\r\nMiami International. A courteous security guard waved them through and\r\nthe driver confidently piloted the car up to a wheeled jetway beside a\r\ncute, stubby little toy jet. On the side, in cursive script, was the\r\nplane's name: Suzanne.\r\n\r\nShe looked accusatorially at Kettlewell.\r\n\r\n\"It was called that when I bought the company,\" he said,\r\nexpressionless but somehow mirthful behind his curved surfer\r\nshades. \"But I kept it because I liked the private joke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just no one tell Freddy that you've got an airplane with my name on\r\nit or we'll never hear the fucking end of it.\"\r\n\r\nShe covered her mouth, regretting her language, and Kettlewell\r\nlaughed, and so did Tjan, and somehow the ice was broken between them.\r\n\r\n\"No *way* flying this thing is cost-effective,\" Tjan said. \"Your CFO\r\nshould be kicking your ass.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a little indulgence,\" Kettlewell said, bounding up the steps and\r\nshaking hands with a small, neat woman pilot, an African-American with\r\ncorn-rows peeking out under her smart peaked cap. \"Once you've flown\r\nin your own bird, you never go back.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a *monstrosity*,\" Tjan said as he boarded. \"What this thing\r\neats up in hangar fees alone would be enough to bankroll three or four\r\nteams.\" He settled into an oversized Barcalounger of a seat and\r\naccepted a glass of orange juice that the pilot poured for him. \"Thank\r\nyou, and no offense.\"\r\n\r\n\"None taken,\" she said. \"I agree one hundred percent.\"\r\n\r\n\"See,\" Tjan said.\r\n\r\nSuzanne took her own seat and her own glass and buckled in and watched\r\nthe two of them, warming up for the main event, realizing that she'd\r\nbeen brought along as a kind of opening act.\r\n\r\n\"They paying you more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yup,\" Tjan said. \"All on the back-end. Half a point on every dollar\r\nbrought in by a team I coach or whose members I mentor.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell whistled. \"That's a big share,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"If I can make my numbers, I'll take home a million this year.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll make those numbers. Good negotiations. Why didn't you ask us\r\nfor the same deal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you have given it to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a star,\" Kettlewell said, nodding at Suzanne, whose\r\ninvisibility to the conversation popped like a bubble. \"Thanks to\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Suzanne,\" Tjan said.\r\n\r\nSuzanne blushed. \"Come on, guys.\"\r\n\r\nTjan shook his head. \"She doesn't really understand. It's actually\r\nkind of charming.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might have matched the offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"You guys are first to market. You've got a lot of procedures in\r\nplace. I wanted to reinvent some wheels.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're too *conservative* for you?\"\r\n\r\nTjan grinned wickedly. \"Oh yes,\" he said. \"I'm going to do business in\r\n*Russia*.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell grunted and pounded his orange juice. Around them, the\r\njet's windows flashed white as they broke through the clouds and the\r\nten thousand foot bell sounded.\r\n\r\n\"How the hell are you going to make anything that doesn't collapse\r\nunder its own weight in Russia?\"\r\n\r\n\"The corruption's a problem, sure,\" Tjan said. \"But it's offset by the\r\nentrepreneurship. Some of those cats make the Chinese look lazy and\r\nunimaginative. It's a shame that so much of their efforts have been\r\ncentered on graft, but there's no reason they couldn't be focused on\r\nmaking an honest ruble.\"\r\n\r\nThey fell into a discussion of the minutiae of Perry and Lester's\r\nbusinesses, franker than any business discussion she'd ever\r\nheard. Tjan talked about the places where they'd screwed up, and\r\nplaces where they'd scored big, and about all the plans he'd made for\r\nWestinghouse, the connections he had in Russia. He even talked about\r\nhis kids and his ex in St Petersburg, and Kettlewell admitted that\r\nhe'd known about them already.\r\n\r\nFor Kettlewell's part, he opened the proverbial kimono wide, telling\r\nTjan about conflicts within the board of directors, poisonous\r\nholdovers from the pre-Kodacell days who sabotaged the company from\r\nwithin with petty bureaucracy, even the problems he was having with\r\nhis family over the long hours they were working. He opened the\r\nminibar and cracked a bottle of champagne to toast Tjan's new job, and\r\nthey mixed it with more orange juice, and then there were bagels and\r\nschmear, fresh fruit, power bars, and canned Starbucks coffees with\r\ndeadly amounts of sugar and caffeine.\r\n\r\nWhen Kettlewell disappeared into the tiny -- but marble-appointed --\r\nbathroom, Suzanne found herself sitting alone with Tjan, almost knee\r\nto knee, lightheaded from lack of sleep and champagne and altitude.\r\n\r\n\"Some trip,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"You're the best,\" he said, wobbling a little. \"You know that? Just\r\nthe best. The stuff you write about these guys, it makes me want to\r\nstand up and salute. You make us all seem so fucking *glorious*. We're\r\ngoing to end up taking over the world because you inspire us so. Maybe\r\nI shouldn't tell you this, because you're not very self-conscious\r\nabout it right now, but Suzanne, you won't believe it because you're\r\nso goddamned modest, too. It's what makes your writing so right, so\r\nbelievable --\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell stepped out of the bathroom. \"Touching down soon,\" he said,\r\nand patted them each on the shoulder as he took his seat. \"So that's\r\nabout it, then,\" he said, and leaned back and closed his eyes. Suzanne\r\nwas accustomed to thinking of him as twenty-something, the boyish age\r\nof the magazine cover portraits from the start of his career. Now,\r\neyes closed on his private jet, harsh upper atmosphere sun painting\r\nhis face, his crowsfeet and the deep vertical brackets around his\r\nmouth revealed him for someone pushing a youthful forty, kept young by\r\nexercise and fun and the animation of his ideas.\r\n\r\n\"Guess so,\" Tjan said, slumping. \"This has been one of the more\r\nmemorable experiences of my life, Kettlewell, Suzanne. Not entirely\r\npleasant, but pleasant on the whole. A magical time in the clouds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once you've flown private, you'll never go back to coach,\" Kettlewell\r\nsaid, smiling, eyes still closed. \"You still think my CFO should spank\r\nme for not selling this thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Tjan said. \"In ten years, if we do our jobs, there won't be five\r\ncompanies on earth that can afford this kind of thing -- it'll be like\r\nbuilding a cathedral after the Protestant Reformation. While we have\r\nthe chance, we should keep these things in the sky. But you should\r\ngive one to Lester and Perry to take apart.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was planning to,\" Kettlewell said. \"Thanks.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne and Kettlewell got off the plane and Tjan didn't look back\r\nwhen they'd landed at JFK. \"Should we go into town and get some bialy\r\nto bring back to Miami?\" Kettlewell said, squinting at the bright day\r\non the tarmac.\r\n\r\n\"Bring deli to Miami?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, right,\" he said. \"Forget I asked. Besides, we'd have to\r\ncharter a chopper to get into Manhattan and back without dying in\r\ntraffic.\"\r\n\r\nSomething about the light through the open hatch or the sound or the\r\nsmell -- something indefinably New York -- made her yearn for\r\nMiami. The great cities of commerce like New York and San Francisco\r\nseemed too real for her, while the suburbs of Florida were a kind of\r\nendless summer camp, a dreamtime where anything was possible.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" she said. The champagne buzz had crashed and she had a\r\ntouch of headache. \"I'm bushed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me too,\" Kettlewell said. \"I left San Jose last night to get into\r\nMiami before Tjan left. Not much sleep. Gonna put my seat back and\r\ncatch some winks, if that's OK?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good plan,\" Suzanne said.\r\n\r\nEmbarrassingly, when they were fully reclined, their seats nearly\r\ntouched, forming something like a double bed. Suzanne lay awake in the\r\nhum of the jets for a while, conscious of the breathing human beside\r\nher, the first man she'd done anything like share a bed with in at\r\nleast a year. The last thing she remembered was the ten thousand foot\r\nbell going off and then she slipped away into sleep.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\n:: Perry thought that they'd sell a million Home Awares in six ::\r\nmonths. Lester thought he was nuts, that number was too high.  :: ::\r\n\"Please,\" he said, \"I *invented* these things but there aren't a ::\r\nmillion roommate households in all of America. We'll sell half :: a\r\nmillion tops, total.\r\n\r\nLester always complained when she quoted him directly in her blog\r\nposts, but she thought he secretly enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n:: Today the boys shipped their millionth unit. It took six weeks.\r\n\r\nThey'd uncorked a bottle of champagne when unit one million\r\nshipped. They hadn't actually shipped it, per se. The manufacturing\r\nwas spread out across forty different teams all across the country,\r\neven a couple of Canadian teams. The RFID printer company had re-hired\r\nhalf the workers they'd laid off the year before, and had them all\r\nworking overtime to meet demand.\r\n\r\n:: What's exciting about this isn't just the money that these guys ::\r\nhave made off of it, or the money that Kodacell will return to :: its\r\nshareholders, it's the ecosystem that these things have ::\r\nenabled. There're at least ten competing commercial systems for ::\r\norganizing, tagging, sharing, and describing Home Aware objects.  ::\r\nParents love them for their kids. School teachers love them.  ::\r\nSeniors' homes.\r\n\r\nThe seniors' homes had been Francis's idea. They'd brought him in to\r\noversee some of the production engineering, along with some of the\r\nyoung braves who ran around the squatter camps. Francis knew which\r\nones were biddable and he kept them to heel. In the evenings, he'd\r\njoin the guys and Suzanne up on the roof of the workshop on folding\r\nchairs, with beers, watching the sweaty sunset.\r\n\r\n:: They're not the sole supplier. That's what an ecosystem is all ::\r\nabout, creating value for a lot of players. All this competition :: is\r\ngreat news for you and me, because it's already driven the :: price of\r\nHome Aware goods down by forty percent. That means that :: Lester and\r\nPerry are going to have to invent something new, soon, :: before the\r\nmargin disappears altogether -- and that's also good :: news for you\r\nand me.\r\n\r\n\"Are you coming?\" Lester had dated a girl for a while, someone he met\r\non Craigslist, but she'd dumped him and Perry had confided that she'd\r\nleft him because he didn't live up to the press he'd gotten in\r\nSuzanne's column. When he got dumped, he became even touchier about\r\nSuzanne, caught at a distance from her that was defined by equal parts\r\nof desire and resentment.\r\n\r\n\"Up in a minute,\" she said, trying to keep her smile light and\r\nnoncommittal. Lester was very nice, but there were times when she\r\ncaught him staring at her like a kicked puppy and it made her\r\nuncomfortable. Naturally, this increased his discomfort as well.\r\n\r\nOn the roof they already had a cooler of beers going and beside it a\r\nhuge plastic tub of brightly colored machine-parts.\r\n\r\n\"Jet engine,\" Perry said. The months had put a couple pounds on him\r\nand new wrinkles, and given him some grey at the temples, and laugh\r\nlines inside his laugh lines. Perry was always laughing at everything\r\naround them (\"They fucking *pay me* to do this,\" he'd told her once,\r\nbefore literally collapsing to the floor, rolling with uncontrollable\r\nhysteria). He laughed again.\r\n\r\n\"Good old Kettlebelly,\" she said. \"Must have broken his heart.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis held up a curved piece of cowling. \"This thing wasn't going to\r\nlast anyway. See the distortion here and here? This thing was designed\r\nin a virtual wind-tunnel and machine-lathed. We tried that a couple\r\ntimes, but the wind-tunnel sims were never detailed enough and the\r\nforms that flew well in the machine always died a premature death in\r\nthe sky. Another two years and he'd have had to have it rebuilt\r\nanyway, and the Koreans who built this charge shitloads for parts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bad,\" Lester said. \"It's pretty. Gorgeous, even.\" He mimed its\r\ncurve in the air with a pudgy hand, that elegant swoop.\r\n\r\n\"Aerospace loves the virtual wind-tunnel,\" Francis said, and glared at\r\nthe cowling. \"You can use evolutionary algorithms in the sim and come\r\nup with really efficient designs, in theory. And computers are cheaper\r\nthan engineers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that why you were laid off?\" Suzanne said.\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't laid off, girl,\" he said. He jiggled his lame foot. \"I\r\nretired at 65 and was all set up but the pension plan went bust. So I\r\nmissed a month of medical and they cut me off and I ended up\r\nuninsured. When the wife took sick, bam, that was it, wiped right\r\nout. But I'm not bitter -- why should the poor be allowed to live,\r\nhuh?\"\r\n\r\nHis acolytes, three teenagers in do-rags from the shantytown, laughed\r\nand went on to pitching bottle-caps off the edge of the roof.\r\n\r\n\"Stop that, now,\" he said, \"you're getting the junkyard all\r\ndirty. Christ, you'd think that they grew up in some kind of zoo.\"\r\nWhen Francis drank, he got a little mean, a little dark.\r\n\r\n\"So, kids,\" Perry said, wandering over to them, hands in\r\npockets. Silhouetted against the setting sun, biceps bulging, muscular\r\nchest tapering to his narrow hips, he looked like a Greek\r\nstatue. \"What do you think of the stuff we're building?\"\r\n\r\nThey looked at their toes. \"'S OK,\" one of them grunted.\r\n\r\n\"Answer the man,\" Francis snapped. \"Complete sentences, looking up and\r\nat him, like you've got a shred of self-respect. Christ, what are you,\r\nfive years old?\"\r\n\r\nThey shifted uncomfortably. \"It's fine,\" one of them said.\r\n\r\n\"Would you use it at home?\"\r\n\r\nOne of them snorted. \"No, man. My dad steals anything nice we get and\r\nsells it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"Fucker broke in the other night and I caught him with my ipod. Nearly\r\ntook his fucking head off with my cannon before I saw who it\r\nwas. Fucking juice-head.\"\r\n\r\n\"You should have fucked him up,\" one of the other kids said. \"My ma\r\npushed my pops in front of a bus one day to get rid of him, guy broke\r\nboth his legs and never came back.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne knew it was meant to shock them, but that didn't take away\r\nfrom its shockingness. In the warm fog of writing and living in\r\nFlorida, it was easy to forget that these people lived in a squatter\r\ncamp and were technically criminals, and received no protection from\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nPerry, though, just squinted into the sun and nodded. \"Have you ever\r\ntried burglar alarms?\"\r\n\r\nThe kids laughed derisively and Suzanne winced, but Perry was\r\nundaunted. \"You could be sure that you woke up whenever anyone\r\nentered, set up a light and siren to scare them off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want one that fires spears,\" the one with the juice-head father\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Blowtorches,\" said the one whose mother pushed his father under a\r\nbus.\r\n\r\n\"I want a force-field,\" the third one said, speaking for the first\r\ntime. \"I want something that will keep anyone from coming in, period,\r\nso I don't have to sleep one eye up, 'cause I'll be safe.\"\r\n\r\nThe other two nodded, slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Damn straight,\" Francis said.\r\n\r\nThat was the last time Francis's acolytes joined them on the\r\nrooftop. Instead, when they finished work they went home, walking\r\nslowly and talking in low murmurs. With just the grownups on the roof,\r\nit was a lot more subdued.\r\n\r\n\"What's that smoke?\" Lester said, pointing at the black billowing\r\ncolumn off to the west, in the sunset's glare.\r\n\r\n\"House-fire,\" Francis said. \"Has to be. Or a big fucking car-wreck,\r\nmaybe.\"\r\n\r\nPerry ran down the stairs and came back up with a pair of high-power\r\nbinox. \"Francis, that's your place,\" he said after a second's\r\nfiddling. He handed the binox to Francis. \"Just hit the button and\r\nthey'll self-stabilize.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my place,\" Francis said. \"Oh, Christ.\" He'd gone gray and\r\nseemed to have sobered up instantly. His lips were wet, his eyes\r\nbright.\r\n\r\nThey drove over at speed, Suzanne wedged into Lester's\r\nfrankensmartcar, practically under his armpit, and Perry traveling\r\nwith Francis. Lester still wore the same cologne as her father, and\r\nwhen she opened the window, its smell was replaced by the\r\nburning-tires smell of the fire.\r\n\r\nThey arrived to discover a fire-truck parked on the side of the\r\nfreeway nearest the shantytown. The fire-fighters were standing\r\nsoberly beside it, watching the fire rage across the canal.\r\n\r\nThey rushed for the footbridge and a firefighter blocked their way.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, it's not safe,\" he said. He was Latino, good looking, like a\r\nmovie star, bronze skin flickering with copper highlights from the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"I live there,\" Francis said. \"That's my home.\"\r\n\r\nThe firefighter looked away. \"It's not safe,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Why aren't you fighting the fire?\" Suzanne said.\r\n\r\nFrancis's head snapped around. \"You're not fighting the fire! You're\r\ngoing to let our houses burn!\"\r\n\r\nA couple more fire-fighters trickled over. Across the river, the fire\r\nhad consumed half of the little settlement. Some of the residents were\r\noperating a slow and ponderous bucket-brigade from the canal, while\r\nothers ran into the unburned buildings and emerged clutching armloads\r\nof belongings, bits of furniture, boxes of photos.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" the movie-star said, \"the owner of this property has asked us\r\nnot to intervene. Since there's no imminent risk to life and no risk\r\nof the burn spreading off his property, we can't trespass to put out\r\nthe fire. Our hands are tied.\"\r\n\r\n\"The owner?\" Francis spat. \"This land is in title dispute. The court\r\ncase has been underway for twenty years now. What owner?\"\r\n\r\nThe movie-star shrugged. \"That's all I know, sir.\"\r\n\r\nAcross the canal, the fire was spreading, and the bucket brigade was\r\nfalling back. Suzanne could feel the heat now, like putting your face\r\nin the steam from a boiling kettle.\r\n\r\nFrancis seethed, looking from the firemen and their truck back to the\r\nfire. He looked like he was going to pop something, or start shouting,\r\nor charge into the flames.\r\n\r\nSuzanne grabbed his hand and walked him over to the truck and grabbed\r\nthe first firefighter she encountered.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Suzanne Church, from the San Jose Mercury News, a McClatchy\r\npaper. I'd like to speak to the commanding officer on the scene,\r\nplease.\" She hadn't been with the Merc for months, but she hadn't been\r\nable to bring herself to say, *I'm Suzanne Church with\r\nSuzanneChurch.org.* She was pretty sure that no matter how high her\r\nreadership was and how profitable her ad sales were, the fire-fighter\r\nwouldn't have been galvanized into the action that was invoked when\r\nshe mentioned the name of a real newspaper.\r\n\r\nHe hopped to, quickly moving to an older man, tapping him on the\r\nshoulder, whispering in his ear. Suzanne squeezed Francis's hand as\r\nthe fire-chief approached them. She extended her hand and talked\r\nfast. \"Suzanne Church,\" she said, and took out her notebook, the key\r\nprop in any set piece involving a reporter. \"I'm told that you are\r\ngoing to let those homes burn because someone representing himself as\r\nthe title-holder to that property has denied you entry. However, I'm\r\nalso told that the title to that land is in dispute and has been in\r\nthe courts for decades. Can you resolve this for me, Chief...?\"\r\n\r\n\"Chief Brian Wannamaker,\" he said. He was her age, with the leathery\r\nskin of a Florida native who spent a lot of time out of doors. \"I'm\r\nafraid I have no comment for you at this time.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne kept her face deadpan, and gave Francis's hand a warning\r\nsqueeze to keep him quiet. He was trembling now. \"I see. You can't\r\ncomment, you can't fight the fire. Is that what you'd like me to write\r\nin tomorrow's paper?\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief looked at the fire for a moment. Across the canal, the\r\nbucket-brigaders were losing worse than ever. He frowned and Suzanne\r\nsaw that his hands were clenched into fists. \"Let me make a call, OK?\"\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, he turned on his heel and stepped\r\nbehind the fire-engine, reaching for his cellphone.\r\n\r\nSuzanne strained to hear his conversation, but it was inaudible over\r\nthe crackle of the fire. When she turned around again, Francis was\r\ngone. She caught sight of him again in just a moment, running for the\r\ncanal, then jumping in and landing badly in the shallow, swampy\r\nwater. He hobbled across to the opposite bank and began to laboriously\r\nclimb it.\r\n\r\nA second later, Perry followed. Then Lester.\r\n\r\n\"Chief!\" she said, going around the engine and pointing. The Chief had\r\nthe phone clamped to his head still, but when he saw what was going\r\non, he snapped it shut, dropped it in his pocket and started barking\r\norders.\r\n\r\nNow the fire-fighters *moved*, boiling across the bridge, uncoiling\r\nhoses, strapping on tanks and masks. They worked in easy, fluid\r\nconcert, and it was only seconds before the water and foam hit the\r\nflames and the smoke changed to white steam.\r\n\r\nThe shantytown residents cheered. The fire slowly receded. Perry and\r\nLester had Francis, holding him back from charging into the fray as\r\nthe fire-fighters executed their clockwork dance.\r\n\r\nThe steam was hot enough to scald, and Suzanne pulled the collar of\r\nher blouse up over her face. Around her were the shantytowners,\r\nmothers with small children, old men, and a seemingly endless parade\r\nof thug-life teenagers, the boys in miniature cycling shorts and\r\ndo-rags, the girls in bandeau tops, glitter makeup, and skirts made\r\nfrom overlapping strips of rag, like post-apocalyptic hula\r\noutfits. Their faces were tight, angry, smudged with smoke and\r\npinkened by the heat.\r\n\r\nShe saw the one whose father had reportedly been pushed under a bus by\r\nhis mother, and he grimaced at her. \"What we gonna do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" she said. \"Are you all right? Is your family all\r\nright?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't got nowhere to sleep, nowhere to go,\" he said. \"Don't even have\r\na change of clothes. My moms won't stop crying.\"\r\n\r\nThere were tears in his eyes. He was all of fifteen, she\r\nrealized. He'd seemed much older on the roof. She gathered him into\r\nher arms and gave him a hug. He was stiff and awkward at first and\r\nthen he kind of melted into her, weeping on her shoulder. She stroked\r\nhis back and murmured reassuringly. Some of the other shantytowners\r\nlooked at the spectacle, then looked away. Even a couple of his\r\nhomeboys -- whom she'd have bet would have laughed and pointed at this\r\nshow of weakness -- only looked and then passed on. One had tears\r\nstreaking the smoke smudges on his face.\r\n\r\n*For someone who isn't good at comforting people, I seem to be doing a\r\n lot of it*, she thought.\r\n\r\nFrancis and Lester and Perry found her and Francis gave the boy a\r\ngruff hug and told him everything would be fine.\r\n\r\nThe fire was out now, the firefighter hosing down the last embers,\r\ngoing through the crowd and checking for injuries. A TV news crew had\r\nset up and a pretty black reporter in her twenties was doing a stand\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\"The illegal squatter community has long been identified as a problem\r\narea for gang and drug activity by the Broward County Sheriff's\r\noffice. The destruction here seems total, but it's impossible to say\r\nwhether this spells the end of this encampment, or whether the\r\ndenizens will rebuild and stay on.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne burned with shame. That could have been her. When she'd first\r\nseen this place, it had been like something out of a documentary on\r\nEthiopia. As she'd come to know it, it had grown homier. The residents\r\nbuilt piecemeal, one wall at a time, one window, one poured concrete\r\nfloor, as they could afford it. None of them had mortgages, but they\r\nhad neat vegetable gardens and walkways spelled out in white stones\r\nwith garden gnomes standing guard.\r\n\r\nThe reporter was staring at her -- and naturally so; she'd been\r\nstaring at the reporter. Glaring at her.\r\n\r\n\"My RV,\" Francis said, pointing, distracting her. It was a charred\r\nwreck. He went to the melted doors and opened them, stepping back as a\r\npuff of smoke rose from the inside. A fire-fighter spotted it and\r\ndiverted a stream of water into the interior, soaking Francis and\r\nwhatever hadn't burned. He turned and shouted something at the\r\nfire-fighter, but he was already hosing down something else.\r\n\r\nInside Francis's trailer, they salvaged a drenched photo-album, a few\r\ntools, and a lock-box with some of his papers in it. He had backed up\r\nhis laptop to his watch that morning, so his data was safe. \"I kept\r\nmeaning to scan these in,\" he said, paging through the photos in the\r\nsoaked album. \"Should have done it.\"\r\n\r\nNight was falling, the mosquitoes singing and buzzing. The neat little\r\nlaneways and homey, patchwork buildings lay in ruins around them.\r\n\r\nThe shantytowners clustered in little groups or picked through the\r\nruins. Drivers of passing cars slowed down to rubberneck, and a few\r\nshouted filthy, vengeful things at them. Suzanne took pictures of\r\ntheir license plates. She'd publish them when she got home.\r\n\r\nA light drizzle fell. Children cried. The swampy sounds of cicadas and\r\nfrogs and mosquitoes filled the growing dark and then the streetlights\r\nflicked on all down the river of highway, painting everything in\r\nblue-white mercury glow.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to get tents up,\" Francis said. He grabbed a couple of\r\nyoung men and gave them orders, things to look for -- fresh water,\r\nplastic sheeting, anything with which to erect shelters.\r\n\r\nLester started to help them, and Perry stood with his hands on his\r\nhips, next to Suzanne.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus Christ,\" he said. \"This is a fucking disaster. I mean, these\r\npeople are used to living rough, but this --\" he broke off, waving his\r\nhands helplessly. He wiped his palms off on his butt, then grabbed\r\nFrancis.\r\n\r\n\"Get them going,\" he said. \"Get them to gather up their stuff and walk\r\nthem down to our place. We've got space for everyone for now at\r\nleast.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis looked like he was going to say something, then he stopped. He\r\nclimbed precariously up on the hood of Lester's car and shouted for\r\npeople to gather round. The boys he bossed around took up the call and\r\nit wasn't long before nearly everyone was gathered around them.\r\n\r\n\"Can everyone hear? This is as loud as I go.\"\r\n\r\nThere were murmurs of assent. Suzanne had seen him meet with his\r\npeople before in the daylight and the good times, seen the respect\r\nthey afforded to him. He wasn't the leader, per se, but when he spoke,\r\npeople listened. It was a characteristic she'd encountered in the\r\nauto-trade and in technology, in the ones the others all gravitated\r\nto. Charismatics.\r\n\r\n\"We've got a place to stay a bit up the road for tonight. It's about a\r\nhalf hour walk. It's indoors and there's toilets, but maybe not much\r\nto make beds out of. Take what you can carry for about a mile, you can\r\ncome back tomorrow for the rest. You don't have to come, but this\r\nisn't going to be any fun tonight.\"\r\n\r\nA woman came forward. She was young, but not young enough to be a\r\nhomegirl. She had long dark hair and she twisted her hands as she\r\nspoke in a soft voice to Francis. \"What about our stuff? We can't\r\nleave it here tonight. It's all we've got.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis nodded. \"We need ten people to stand guard in two shifts of\r\nfive tonight. Young people. You'll get flashlights and phones, coffee\r\nand whatever else we can give you. Just keep the rubberneckers out.\"\r\nThe rubberneckers were out of earshot. The account they'd get of this\r\nwould come from the news-anchor who'd tell them how dangerous and\r\ndirty this place was. They'd never see what Suzanne saw, ten men and\r\nwomen forming up to one side of the crowd. Young braves and homegirls,\r\npeople her age, their faces solemn.\r\n\r\nFrancis oversaw the gathering up of belongings. Suzanne had never had\r\na sense of how many people lived in the shantytown but now she could\r\ncount them as they massed up by the roadside and began to walk: a\r\nhundred, a little more than a hundred. More if you counted the\r\nsurprising number of babies.\r\n\r\nLester conferred briefly with Francis and then Francis tapped three of\r\nthe old timers and two of the mothers with babes in arms and they\r\ncrammed into Lester's car and he took off. Suzanne walked by the\r\nroadside with the long line of refugees, listening to their murmuring\r\nconversation, and in a few minutes, Lester was back to pick up more\r\npeople, at Francis's discretion.\r\n\r\nPerry was beside her now, his eyes a million miles away.\r\n\r\n\"What now?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"We put them in the workshop tonight, tomorrow we help them build\r\nhouses.\"\r\n\r\n\"At your place? You're going to let them stay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? We don't use half of that land. The landlord gets his check\r\nevery month. Hasn't been by in five years. He won't care.\"\r\n\r\nShe took a couple more steps. \"Perry, I'm going to write about this,\"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he said. They walked further. A small child was crying. \"Of\r\ncourse you are. Well, fuck the landlord. I'll sic Kettlewell on him if\r\nhe squawks.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think Kettlewell will think about all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"This? Look, this is what I've been saying all along. We need to make\r\nproducts for these people. They're a huge untapped market.\"\r\n\r\nWhat she wanted to ask was *What would Tjan say about this?* but they\r\ndidn't talk about Tjan these days. Kettlewell had promised them a new\r\nbusiness manager for weeks, but none had appeared. Perry had taken\r\nover more and more of the managerial roles, and was getting less and\r\nless workshop time in. She could tell it frustrated him. In her\r\ndiscussions with Kettlewell, he'd confided that it had turned out to\r\nbe harder to find suits than it was finding wildly inventive\r\nnerds. Lots of people *wanted* to run businesses, but the number who\r\nactually seemed likely to be capable of doing so was only a small\r\nfraction.\r\n\r\nThey could see the junkyard now. Perry pulled out his phone and called\r\nhis server and touch-toned the codes to turn on all the lights and\r\nunlock all the doors.\r\n\r\nThey lost a couple of kids in the aisles of miraculous junk, and\r\nFrancis had to send out bigger kids to find them and bring them back,\r\nholding the treasures they'd found to their chests. Lester kept going\r\nback for more old-timers, more mothers, more stragglers, operating his\r\nferry service until they were all indoors in the workshop.\r\n\r\n\"This is the place,\" Francis said. \"We'll stay indoors here\r\ntonight. Toilets are there and there -- orderly lines, no shoving.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about food?\" asked a man with a small boy sleeping over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"This isn't the Red Cross, Al,\" Francis snapped. \"We'll organize food\r\nfor ourselves in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nPerry whispered in his ear. Francis shook his head, and Perry\r\nwhispered some more.\r\n\r\n\"There will be food in the morning. This is Perry. It's his\r\nplace. He's going to go to Costco for us when they open.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd cheered and a few of the women hugged him. Some of the men\r\nshook his hand. Perry blushed. Suzanne smiled. These people were good\r\npeople. They'd been through more than Suzanne could imagine. It felt\r\nright that she could help them -- like making up for every panhandler\r\nshe'd ignored and every passed-out drunk she'd stepped over.\r\n\r\nThere were no blankets, there were no beds. The squatters slept on the\r\nconcrete floor. Young couples spooned under tables. Children snuggled\r\nbetween their parents, or held onto their mothers. As the squatters\r\ndossed down and as Suzanne walked past them to get to her car her\r\nheart broke a hundred times. She felt like one of those Depression-era\r\nphotographers walking through an Okie camp, a rending visual at each\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nBack at her rented condo, she found herself at the foot of her\r\ncomfortable bed with its thick duvet -- she liked keeping the AC\r\nturned up enough to snuggle under a blanket -- and the four\r\npillows. She was in her jammies, but she couldn't climb in between\r\nthose sheets.\r\n\r\nShe couldn't.\r\n\r\nAnd then she was back in her car with all her blankets, sheets,\r\npillows, big towels -- even the sofa cushions, which the landlord was\r\nnot going to be happy about -- and speeding back to the workshop.\r\n\r\nShe let herself in and set about distributing the blankets and pillows\r\nand towels, picking out the families, the old people. A woman --\r\napparently able-bodied and young, but skinny -- sat up and said, \"Hey,\r\nwhere's one for me?\" Suzanne recognized the voice. The junkie from the\r\nIHOP. Lester's friend. The one who'd grabbed her and cursed her.\r\n\r\nShe didn't want to give the woman a blanket. She only had two left and\r\nthere were old people lying on the bare floor.\r\n\r\n\"Where's one for me?\" the woman said more loudly. Some of the sleepers\r\nstirred. Some of them sat up.\r\n\r\nSuzanne was shaking. Who the hell was she to decide who got a blanket?\r\nDid being rude to her at the IHOP disqualify you from getting bedding\r\nwhen your house burned down?\r\n\r\nSuzanne gave her a blanket, and she snatched one of the sofa cushions\r\nbesides.\r\n\r\n*It's why she's still alive,* Suzanne thought. *How she's survived.*\r\n\r\nShe gave away the last blanket and went home to sleep on her naked bed\r\nunderneath an old coat, a rolled-up sweater for a pillow. After her\r\nshower, she dried herself on tee-shirts, having given away all her\r\ntowels to use as bedding.\r\n\r\nThe new shantytown went up fast -- faster than she'd dreamed\r\npossible. The boys helped. Lester downloaded all the information he\r\ncould find on temporary shelters -- building out of mud, out of\r\nsandbags, out of corrugated cardboard and sheets of plastic -- and\r\nthey tried them all. Some of the houses had two or more\r\nrickety-seeming stories, but they all felt solid enough as she toured\r\nthem, snapping photos of proud homesteaders standing next to their\r\nhandiwork.\r\n\r\nLittle things went missing from the workshops -- tools, easily pawned\r\nbooks and keepsakes, Perry's wallet -- and they all started locking\r\ntheir desk-drawers. There were junkies in among the squatters, and\r\ndesperate people, and immoral people, them too. One day she found that\r\nher cute little gold earrings weren't beside her desk-lamp, where\r\nshe'd left them the night before and she practically burst into tears,\r\nfeeling set-upon on all sides.\r\n\r\nShe found the earrings later that day, at the bottom of her purse, and\r\nthat only made things worse. Even though she hadn't voiced a single\r\naccusation, she'd accused every one of the squatters in her mind that\r\nday. She found herself unable to meet their eyes for the rest of the\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n\"I have to write about this,\" she said to Perry. \"This is part of the\r\nstory.\" She'd stayed clear of it for a month, but she couldn't go on\r\nwriting about the successes of the Home Aware without writing about\r\nthe workforce that was turning out the devices and add-ons by the\r\nthousands, all around her, in impromptu factories with impromptu\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" Perry said. He'd been a dervish, filling orders, training\r\npeople, fighting fires. By nightfall, he was hollow-eyed and\r\nsnappish. Lester didn't join them on the roof anymore. He liked to\r\nhang out with Francis and some of the young men and pitch horseshoes\r\ndown in the shantytown, or tinker with the composting toilets he'd\r\nbeen installing at strategic crossroads through the town. \"Can't you\r\njust concentrate on the business?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perry, this *is* the business. Kettlewell hasn't sent a replacement\r\nfor Tjan and you've filled in and you've turned this place into\r\nsomething like a worker-owned co-op. That's important news -- the\r\npoint of this exercise is to try all the different businesses that are\r\npossible and see what works. If you've found something that works, I\r\nshould write about it. Especially since it's not just solving\r\nKodacell's problem, it's solving the problem for all of those people,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\nPerry drank his beer in sullen silence. \"I don't want Kettlewell to\r\nget more involved in this. It's going good. Scrutiny could kill it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got nothing to be embarrassed about here,\" she said. \"There's\r\nnothing here that isn't as it should be.\"\r\n\r\nPerry looked at her for a long moment. He was at the end of his fuse,\r\ntrying to do too much, and she regretted having brought it up. \"You do\r\nwhat you have to do,\" he said.\r\n\r\n:: The original shantytown was astonishing. Built around a nexus of ::\r\ntrailers and RVs that didn't look in the least roadworthy, the ::\r\nsettlers had added dwelling on dwelling to their little patch of ::\r\nland. They started with plastic sheeting and poles, and when they ::\r\ncould afford it, they replaced the sheets, one at a time, with ::\r\nbricks or poured concrete and re-bar. They thatched their roofs ::\r\nwith palm-leaves, shingles, linoleum, corrugated tin -- even ::\r\nplywood with flattened beer-cans. Some walls were wood. Some had ::\r\nwindows. Some were made from old car-doors, with hand-cranked ::\r\nhandles to lower them in the day, then roll them up again at :: night\r\nwhen the mosquitoes came out. Most of the settlers slept on :: nets.\r\n:: :: A second wave had moved into the settlement, just as I arrived,\r\n:: and rather than building out -- and farther away from their ::\r\nneighbors' latrines, water-pump and mysterious sources of ::\r\nelectrical power -- they built *up*, on top of the existing ::\r\nstructures, shoring up the walls where necessary. It wasn't ::\r\nhurricane proof, but neither are the cracker-box condos that ::\r\n\"property owners\" occupy. They made contractual arrangements with ::\r\nthe dwellers of the first stories, paid them rent. A couple with ::\r\nsecond-story rooms opposite one another in one of the narrow ::\r\n\"streets\" consummated their relationship by building a sky-bridge ::\r\nbetween their rooms, paying joint rent to two landlords.  :: :: The\r\nthing these motley houses had in common, all of them, was :: ingenuity\r\nand pride of work.

They sent ::\r\ntheir kids to school, faking local addresses with PO boxes. Some ::\r\nwere retired. Some were just down on their luck.  :: :: They helped\r\neach other.

When someone needed medical :: care, they chipped in\r\nfor a taxi to the free clinic, or someone :: with a working car drove\r\nthem. They were like the neighbors of :: the long-lamented American\r\ntown, an ideal of civic virtue that is :: so remote in our ancestry as\r\nto have become mythical. There were :: eyes on the street here, proud\r\nresidents who knew what everyone :: was about and saw to it that bad\r\nbehavior was curbed before it :: could get started.  :: :: Somehow, it\r\nburned down.

[profile: ten shanties and the technology\r\n:: inside them]\r\n\r\nThe response was enormous and passionate. Dozens of readers wrote to\r\ntell her that she'd been taken in by these crooks who had stolen the\r\nland they squatted. She'd expected that -- she'd felt that way\r\nherself, when she'd first walked past the shantytown.\r\n\r\nBut what surprised her more were the message-board posts and emails\r\nfrom homeless people who'd been living in their cars, on the streets,\r\nin squatted houses or in shanties. To read these, you'd think that\r\nhalf her readership was sleeping rough and getting online at\r\nlibraries, Starbuckses, and stumbled wireless networks that they\r\naccessed with antique laptops on street-corners.\r\n\r\n\"Kettlewell's coming down to see this,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\nHer stomach lurched. She'd gotten the boys in trouble. \"Is he mad?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't tell -- I got voicemail at three AM.\" Midnight in San\r\nJose, the hour at which Kettlewell got his mad impulses. \"He'll be\r\nhere this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"That jet makes it too easy for him to get around,\" she said, and\r\nstretched out her back. Sitting at her desk all morning answering\r\nemails and cleaning up some draft posts before blogging them had her\r\nin knots. It was practically lunch-time.\r\n\r\n\"Perry,\" she began, then trailed off.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right,\" he said. \"I know why you did it. Christ, we wouldn't\r\nbe where we are if you hadn't written about us. I'm in no position to\r\ntell you to stop now.\" He swallowed. The month since the shantytowners\r\nhad moved in had put five years on him. His tan was fading, the\r\nwrinkles around his eyes deeper, grey salting his stubbly beard and\r\nshort hair. \"But you'll help me with Kettlewell, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll come along and write down what he says,\" she said. \"That usually\r\nhelps.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\n:: Kodacell is supposed to be a new way of doing business.  ::\r\nDecentralized, net-savvy, really twenty-first century.

He's\r\njust looking to sell banner-space. This is how the Brit rags write --\r\nit's all meanspirited sniping.\" Suzanne had never seen Kettlewell so\r\nfrustrated. His surfer good looks were fading fast -- he was getting a\r\nlittle paunch on him and his cheeks were sagging off his bones into\r\nthe beginnings of jowls. His car had pulled up to the end of the\r\ndriveway and he'd gotten out and walked through the shantytown with\r\nthe air of a man in a dream. The truckers who pulled in and out all\r\nweek picking up orders had occasionally had a curious word at the odd\r\nlittle settlement, but for Suzanne it had all but disappeared into her\r\nnormal experience. Kettlewell made it strange and even a little\r\noutrageous, just by his stiff, outraged walk through its streets.\r\n\r\n\"You think I'm letting *Freddy* drive this decision?\" He had spittle\r\nflecks on the corners of his mouth. \"Christ, Suzanne, you're supposed\r\nto be the adult around here.\"\r\n\r\nPerry looked up from the floor in front of him, which he had been\r\nstaring at intently. Suzanne caught his involuntary glare at\r\nKettlewell before he dropped his eyes again. Lester put a big meaty\r\npaw on Perry's shoulder. Kettlewell was oblivious.\r\n\r\n\"Those people can't stay, all right? The shareholders are baying for\r\nblood. The fucking liability -- Christ, what if one of those places\r\nburns down? What if one of them knifes another one? We're on the hook\r\nfor everything they do. We could end up being on the hook for a\r\nfucking *cholera epidemic*.\"\r\n\r\nIrrationally, Suzanne burned with anger at Freddy. He had written\r\nevery venal, bilious word with the hope that it would result in a\r\nscene just like this one. And not because he had any substantive\r\nobjection to what was going on: simply because he had a need to deride\r\nthat which others hailed. He wasn't afflicting the mighty, though: he\r\nwas taking on the very meekest, people who had *nothing*, including a\r\nmeans of speaking up for themselves.\r\n\r\nPerry looked up. \"You've asked me to come up with something new and\r\nincredible every three to six months. Well, this is new and\r\nincredible. We've built a living lab on our doorstep for exploring an\r\nenormous market opportunity to provide low-cost, sustainable\r\ntechnology for use by a substantial segment of the population who have\r\nno fixed address. There are millions of American squatters and\r\nbillions of squatters worldwide. They have money to spend and no one\r\nelse is trying to get it from them.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell thrust his chin forward. \"How many millions? How much money\r\ndo they have to spend? How do you know that any of this will make us a\r\nsingle cent? Where's the market research? Was there any? Or did you\r\njust invite a hundred hobos to pitch their tent out front of my\r\nfactory on the strength of your half-assed guesses?\"\r\n\r\nLester held up a hand. \"We don't have any market research, Kettlewell,\r\nbecause we don't have a business-manager on the team anymore. Perry's\r\nbeen taking that over as well as his regular work, and he's been\r\nworking himself sick for you. We're flying by the seat of our pants\r\nhere because you haven't sent us a pilot.\"\r\n\r\n\"You need an MBA to tell you not to turn your workplace into a slum?\"\r\nKettlewell said. He was boiling. Suzanne very carefully pulled out her\r\npad and wrote this down. It was all she had, but sometimes it was\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nKettlewell noticed. \"Get out,\" he said. \"I want to talk with these two\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Suzanne said. \"That's not our deal. I get to document\r\neverything. *That's* the deal.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell glared at her, and then he deflated. He sagged and took two\r\nsteps to the chair behind Perry's desk and collapsed into it.\r\n\r\n\"Put the notebook away, Suzanne, please?\"\r\n\r\nShe silently shook her head at him. He locked eyes with her for a\r\nmoment, then nodded curtly. She resumed writing.\r\n\r\n\"Guys, the major shareholders are going to start dumping their stock\r\nthis week. A couple of pension funds, a merchant bank. It's about ten,\r\nfifteen percent of the company. When that happens, our ticker price is\r\ngoing to fall by sixty percent or more.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're going to short us because they don't like what we've done\r\nhere?\" Perry said. \"Christ, that's ridiculous!\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell sighed and put his face in his hands, scrubbed at his\r\neyes. \"No, Perry, no. They're doing it because they can't figure out\r\nhow to value us. Our business units have an industry-high return on\r\ninvestment, but there's not enough of them. We've only signed a\r\nthousand teams and we wanted ten thousand, so ninety percent of the\r\nmoney we had to spend is sitting in the bank at garbage interest\r\nrates. We need to soak up that money with big projects -- the Hoover\r\nDam, Hong Kong Disneyland, the Big Dig. All we've got are little\r\nprojects.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it's not our fault then, is it?\" Lester said. Perry was staring\r\nout the window.\r\n\r\n\"No, it's not your fault, but this doesn't help. This is a disaster\r\nwaiting to turn into a catastrophe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm down, Landon,\" Perry said. \"Calm down for a sec and listen to\r\nme, OK?\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell looked at him and sighed. \"Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are more than a billion squatters worldwide. San Francisco has\r\nbeen giving out tents and shopping carts ever since they ran out of\r\nshelter beds in the nineties. From Copenhagen to Capetown, there are\r\nmore and more people who are going off the grid, often in the middle\r\nof cities.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne nodded. \"They farm Detroit, in the ruins of old\r\nbuildings. Raise crops and sell them. Chickens, too. Even pigs.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's something there. These people have money, like I said. They\r\nbuy and sell in the stream of commerce. They often have to buy at a\r\npremium because the services and goods available to them are limited\r\n-- think of how a homeless person can't take advantage of\r\nbulk-packaged perishables because she doesn't have a fridge. They are\r\nthe spirit of ingenuity, too -- they mod their cars, caves, anything\r\nthey can find to be living quarters. They turn RVs into permanent\r\nhomes. They know more about tents, sleeping bags and cardboard than\r\nany UN SHELTER specialist. These people need housing, goods,\r\nappliances, you name it. It's what Tjan used to call a green-field\r\nmarket: no one else knows it's there. You want something you can spend\r\nungodly amounts of money on? This is it. Get every team in the company\r\nto come up with products for these people. Soak up every cent they\r\nspend. Better us providing them with quality goods at reasonable\r\nprices than letting them get ripped off by the profiteers who have a\r\ncaptive market. This plant is a living lab: this is the kind of market\r\nintelligence you can't buy, right here. We should set up more of\r\nthese. Invite squatters all over the country to move onto our grounds,\r\ntest out our products, help us design, build and market them. We can\r\nrecruit traveling salespeople to go door to door in the shanties and\r\ntake orders. Shit, man, you talk about the Grameen Bank all the time\r\n-- why not go into business providing these people with easy\r\nmicrocredit without preying on them the way the banks do? Then we\r\ncould loan them money to buy things that we sell them that they use to\r\nbetter their lives and earn more money so they can pay us back and buy\r\nmore things and borrow more money --\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell held up a hand. \"I like the theory. It's a nice story. But\r\nI have to sell this to my Board, and they want more than stories:\r\nwhere can I get the research to back this up?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're it,\" Perry said. \"This place, right here. There's no numbers to\r\nprove what I'm saying is right because everyone who knows it's right\r\nis too busy chasing after it and no one else believes it. But right\r\nhere, if we're allowed to do this -- right here we can prove it. We've\r\ngot the capital in our account, we're profitable, and we can roll\r\nthose profits back into more R&D for the future of the company.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne was writing so fast she was getting a hand cramp. Perry had\r\nnever given speeches like this, even a month before. Tjan's leaving\r\nhad hurt them all, but the growth it had precipitated in Perry was\r\nstunning.\r\n\r\nKettlewell argued more, but Perry was a steamroller and Suzanne was\r\nwriting down what everyone said and that kept it all civil, like a\r\nsilent camera rolling in the corner of the room. No one looked at her,\r\nbut she was the thing they were conspicuously not looking at.\r\n\r\nFrancis took the news calmly. \"Sound business strategy. Basically,\r\nit's what I've been telling you to do all along, so I'm bound to like\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nIt took a couple weeks to hive off the Home Aware stuff to some of the\r\nother Kodacell business-units. Perry flew a bunch, spending days in\r\nMinnesota, Oregon, Ohio, and Michigan overseeing the retooling efforts\r\nthat would let him focus on his new project.\r\n\r\nBy the time he got back, Lester had retooled their own workspace,\r\nconverting it to four functional areas: communications, shelter, food\r\nand entertainment. \"They were Francis's idea,\" he said. Francis's\r\ngimpy leg was bothering him more and more, but he'd overseen the work\r\nfrom a rolling ergonomic office-chair. \"It's his version of the\r\nhierarchy of needs -- stuff he knows for sure we can sell.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first time the boys had launched something new without\r\nknowing what it was, where they'd started with a niche and decided to\r\nfill it instead of starting with an idea and looking for a niche for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"You're going to underestimate the research time,\" Francis said during\r\none of their flip-chart brainstorms, where they had been covering\r\nsheet after sheet with ideas for products they could build. \"Everyone\r\nunderestimates research time. Deciding what to make is always harder\r\nthan making it.\" He'd been drinking less since he'd gotten involved in\r\nthe retooling effort, waking earlier, bossing around his young-blood\r\nposse to get him paper, bricks, Tinkertoys.\r\n\r\nHe was right. Suzanne steadily recorded the weeks ticking by as the\r\nfour competing labs focus-grouped, designed, tested and scrapped all\r\nmanner of \"tchotchkes for tramps,\" as Freddy had dubbed it in a\r\nspiraling series of ever-more-bilious columns. But the press was\r\nmostly positive: camera crews liked to come by and shoot the\r\ncompound. One time, the pretty black reporter from the night of the\r\nfire came by and said very nice things during her standup. Her name\r\nwas Maria and she was happy to talk shop with Suzanne, endlessly\r\nfascinated by a \"real\" journalist who'd gone permanently slumming on\r\nthe Internet.\r\n\r\n\"The problem is that all this stuff is too specialized, it has too\r\nmany prerequisites,\" Perry said, staring at a waterproof,\r\ncement-impregnated bag that could be filled with a hose, allowed to\r\ndry, and used as a self-contained room. \"This thing is great for\r\nrefugees, but it's too one-size-fits all for squatters. They have to\r\nbe able to heavily customize everything they use to fit into really\r\nspecialized niches.\"\r\n\r\nMore squatters had arrived to take up residence with them -- families,\r\nfriends, a couple of dodgy drifters -- and a third story was going\r\nonto the buildings in the camp. They were even more Dr Seussian than\r\nthe first round, idiosyncratic structures that had to be built light\r\nto avoid crushing the floors below them, hanging out over the narrow\r\nstreets, corkscrewing like vines seeking sun.\r\n\r\nHe kept staring, and would have been staring still had he not heard\r\nthe sirens. Three blue-and-white Broward County sheriff's cars were\r\nracing down the access road into their dead mall, sirens howling,\r\nlights blazing.\r\n\r\nThey screeched to a halt at the shantytown's edge and their doors flew\r\nopen. Four cops moved quickly into the shantytown, while two more\r\nworked the radios, sheltering by the cars.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus Christ,\" Perry said. He ran for the door, but Suzanne grabbed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Don't run toward armed cops,\" she said. \"Don't do anything that looks\r\nthreatening. Slow down, Perry.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a couple deep breaths. Then he looked around his lab for a\r\nwhile, frantically muttering, \"Where the fuck did I put it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Use Home Aware,\" she said. He shook his head, grimaced, went to a\r\nkeyboard and typed MEGAPHONE. One of the lab-drawers started to throb\r\nwith a white glow.\r\n\r\nHe pulled out the megaphone and went to his window.\r\n\r\n\"ATTENTION POLICE,\" he said. \"THIS IS THE LEASEHOLDER FOR THIS\r\nPROPERTY. WHY ARE YOU RUNNING AROUND WITH YOUR GUNS DRAWN? WHAT IS\r\nGOING ON?\"\r\n\r\nThe police at the cars looked toward the workshop, then back to the\r\nshantytown, then back to the workshop.\r\n\r\n\"SERIOUSLY. THIS IS NOT COOL. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?\"\r\n\r\nOne of the cops grabbed the mic for his own loudhailer. \"THIS IS THE\r\nBROWARD COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. WE HAVE RECEIVED INTELLIGENCE\r\nTHAT AN ARMED FUGITIVE IS ON THESE PREMISES. WE HAVE COME TO RETRIEVE\r\nHIM.\"\r\n\r\n\"WELL, THAT'S WEIRD. NONE OF THE CHILDREN, CIVILIANS AND HARDWORKING\r\nPEOPLE HERE ARE FUGITIVES AS FAR AS I KNOW. CERTAINLY THERE'S NO ONE\r\nARMED AROUND HERE. WHY DON'T YOU GET BACK IN YOUR CARS AND I'LL COME\r\nOUT AND WE'LL RESOLVE THIS LIKE CIVILIZED PEOPLE, OK?\"\r\n\r\nThe cop shook his head and reached for his mic again, and then there\r\nwere two gunshots, a scream, and a third.\r\n\r\nPerry ran for the door and Suzanne chased after him, trying to stop\r\nhim. The cops at the cars were talking intently into their radios,\r\nthough it was impossible to know if they were talking to their\r\ncomrades in the shantytown or to their headquarters. Perry burst out\r\nof the factory door and there was another shot and he spun around,\r\nstaggered back a step, and fell down like a sack of grain. There was\r\nblood around his head. Suzanne stuck her hand in her mouth to stifle a\r\nscream and stood helplessly in the doorway of the workshop, just a few\r\npaces from Perry.\r\n\r\nLester came up behind her and firmly moved her aside. He lumbered\r\ndeliberately and slowly and fearlessly to Perry's side, knelt beside\r\nhim, touched him gently. His face was grey. Perry thrashed softly and\r\nSuzanne let out a sound like a cry, then remembered herself and took\r\nout her camera and began to shoot and shoot and shoot: the cops,\r\nLester with Perry like a tragic Pieta, the shantytowners running back\r\nand forth screaming. Snap of the cops getting out of their cars, guns\r\nin hands, snap of them fanning out around the shantytown, snap of them\r\ncoming closer and closer, snap of a cop pointing his gun at Lester,\r\nordering him away from Perry, snap of a cop approaching her.\r\n\r\n\"It's live,\" she said, not looking up from the viewfinder. \"Going out\r\nlive to my blog. Daily readership half a million. They're watching you\r\nnow, every move. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\nThe officer said, \"Put the camera down, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\nShe held the camera. \"I can't quote the First Amendment from memory,\r\nnot exactly, but I know it well enough that I'm not moving this\r\ncamera. It's live, you understand -- every move is going out live,\r\nright now.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer stepped back, turned his head, muttered in his mic.\r\n\r\n\"There's an ambulance coming,\" he said. \"Your friend was shot with a\r\nnonlethal rubber bullet.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's bleeding from the head,\" Lester said. \"From the eye.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne shuddered.\r\n\r\nAmbulance sirens in the distance. Lester stroked Perry's hair. Suzanne\r\ntook a step back and panned it over Perry's ruined face, bloody and\r\nswollen. The rubber bullet must have taken him either right in the eye\r\nor just over it.\r\n\r\n\"Perry Mason Gibbons was unarmed and posed no threat to Sheriff's\r\nDeputy Badge Number 5724 --\" she zoomed in on it -- \"when he was shot\r\nwith a rubber bullet in the eye. He is unconscious and bloody on the\r\nground in front of the workshop where he has worked quietly and\r\nunassumingly to invent and manufacture new technologies.\"\r\n\r\nThe cop knew when to cut his losses. He turned aside and walked back\r\ninto the shantytown, leaving Suzanne to turn her camera on Perry, on\r\nthe EMTs who evacced him to the ambulance, on the three injured\r\nshantytowners who were on the ambulance with him, on the corpse they\r\nwheeled out on his own gurney, one of the newcomers to the shantytown,\r\na man she didn't recognize.\r\n\r\nThey operated on Perry all that night, gingerly tweezing fragments of\r\nbone from his shattered left orbit out of his eye and face. Some had\r\nfloated to the back of the socket and posed a special risk of brain\r\ndamage, the doctor explained into her camera.\r\n\r\nLester was a rock, sitting silently in the waiting room, talking\r\ncalmly and firmly with the cops and over the phone to Kettlewell and\r\nthe specially impaneled board-room full of Kodacell lawyers who wanted\r\nto micromanage this. Rat-Toothed Freddy filed a column in which he\r\ncalled her a \"grandstanding bint,\" and accused Kodacell of harboring\r\ndangerous fugitives. He'd dug up the fact that one of the newcomers to\r\nthe shantytown -- not the one they'd killed, that was a bystander --\r\nwas wanted for holding up a liquor-store with a corkscrew the year\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nLester unscrewed his earphone and scrubbed at his eyes. Impulsively,\r\nshe leaned over and gave him a hug. He stiffened up at first but then\r\nrelaxed and enfolded her in his huge, warm arms. She could barely make\r\nher arms meet around his broad, soft back -- it was like hugging a\r\ngiant loaf of bread. She squeezed tighter and he did too. He was a\r\ngood hugger.\r\n\r\n\"You holding in there, kiddo?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" he murmured into her neck. \"No.\" He squeezed tighter. \"As well\r\nas I need to, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor pried them apart to tell them that the EEG and fMRI were\r\nboth negative for any brain-damage, and that they'd managed to salvage\r\nthe eye, probably. Kodacell was springing for all the care he needed,\r\ncash money, no dorking around with the fucking HMO, so the doctors had\r\nput him through every machine on the premises in a series of\r\nfarcically expensive tests.\r\n\r\n\"I hope they sue the cops for the costs,\" the doctor said. She was\r\nPakistani or Bangladeshi, with a faint accent, and very pretty even\r\nwith the dark circles under her eyes. \"I read your columns,\" she said,\r\nshaking Suzanne's hand. \"I admire the work you do,\" she said, shaking\r\nLester's hand. \"I was born in Delhi. We were squatters who were given\r\na deed to our home and then evicted because we couldn't pay the\r\ntaxes. We had to build again, in the rains, outside of the city, and\r\nthen again when we were evicted again.\"\r\n\r\nShe had two brothers who were working for startups like Kodacell's,\r\nbut run by other firms: one was backed by McDonald's, the other by the\r\nAFL-CIO's investment arm. Suzanne did a little interview with her\r\nabout her brothers' projects -- a bike-helmet that had been\r\nalgorithmically evolved for minimum weight and maximum protection; a\r\nsmart skylight that deformed itself to follow light based on simple\r\nphototropic controllers. The brother working on bike-helmets was\r\nriding a tiger and could barely keep up with orders; he was consuming\r\nabout half of the operational capacity of the McDonald's network and\r\nclimbing fast.\r\n\r\nLester joined in, digging on the details. He'd been following the\r\nskylights in blogs and on a list or two, and he'd heard of the\r\ndoctor's brother, which really tweaked her, she was visibly proud of\r\nher family.\r\n\r\n\"But your work is most important. Things for the homeless. We get them\r\nin here sometimes, hurt, off the ambulances. We usually turn them away\r\nagain. The ones who sell off the highway medians and at the traffic\r\nlights.\" Suzanne had seen them, selling homemade cookies, oranges,\r\nflowers, newspapers, plasticky toys, sad or beautiful handicrafts. She\r\nhad a carved coconut covered in intricate scrimshaw that she'd bought\r\nfrom a little girl who was all skin and bones except for her\r\nmalnourished pot-belly.\r\n\r\n\"They get hit by cars?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" the doctor said. \"Deliberately, too. Or beaten up.\"\r\n\r\nPerry was moved out of the operating theater to a recovery room and\r\nthen to a private room and by then they were ready to collapse, though\r\nthere was so much email in response to her posts that she ended up\r\npounding on her computer's keyboard all the way home as Lester drove\r\nthem, squeezing the bridge of his nose to stay awake. She didn't even\r\ntake her clothes off before collapsing into bed.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\n\"They need the tools to make any other tools,\" is what Perry said when\r\nhe returned from the hospital, the side of his head still swaddled in\r\nbandages that draped over his injured eye. They'd shaved his head at\r\nhis insistence, saying that he wasn't going to try to keep his hair\r\nclean with all the bandages. It made him look younger, and his fine\r\nskull-bones stood out through his thin scalp when he finally came\r\nhome. Before he'd looked like a outdoorsman engineer: now he looked\r\nlike a radical, a pirate.\r\n\r\n\"They need the tools that will let them build anything else, for free,\r\nand use it or sell it.\" He gestured at the rapid prototyping machines\r\nthey had, the three-d printer and scanner setups. \"I mean something\r\nlike that, but I want it to be capable of printing out the parts\r\nnecessary to assemble another one. Machines that can reproduce\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis shifted in his seat. \"What are they supposed to do with\r\nthose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything,\" Perry said, his eye glinting. \"Make your kitchen\r\nfixtures. Make your shoes and hat. Make your kids' toys -- if it's in\r\nthe stores, it should be a downloadable too. Make toolchests and\r\ntools. Make it and build it and sell it. Make other printers and sell\r\nthem. Make machines that make the goop we feed into the\r\nprinters. Teach a man to fish, Francis, teach a man to fucking\r\n*fish*. No top-down 'solutions' driven by 'market research'\" -- his\r\nfinger-quotes oozed sarcasm -- \"the thing that we need to do is make\r\nthese people the authors of their own destiny.\"\r\n\r\nThey put up the sign that night: AUTHOR OF YOUR OWN DESTINY, hung over\r\nthe workshop door. Suzanne trailed after Perry transcribing the rants\r\nthat spilled out of his mouth as he explained it to Lester and\r\nFrancis, and then to Kettlewell when he called, and then to the pretty\r\nyoung black lady from the TV who by now had figured out that there was\r\na real story in her backyard, then to an NPR man on the phone, and\r\nthen to a CNN crew who drove in from Miami and filmed the shantytown\r\nand the workshop like Japanese tourists at Disney World, never having\r\nventured into the skanky, failed strip-mall suburbs just outside of\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nFrancis had a protege who had a real dab touch with the 3-D\r\nprinters. The manufacturer, Lester's former employer, had been out of\r\nbusiness for two years by then, so all the service on the machines had\r\nto be done on the premises. Francis's protege -- the one who claimed\r\nhis mother had pushed his father under a bus, his name was Jason --\r\nwatched Lester work on recalcitrant machines silently for a couple\r\ndays, then started to hand him the tool he needed next without having\r\nto be asked. Then he diagnosed a problem that had stumped Lester all\r\nmorning. Then he suggested an improvement to the feedstock pump that\r\nincreased the mean time between failures by a couple hours.\r\n\r\n\"No, man, no, not like that,\" Jason said to one of the small gang of\r\nboys he was bossing. \"Gently, or you'll snap it off.\" The boy snapped\r\nit off and Jason pulled another replacement part out of a tub and\r\nsaid, \"See, like *this*,\" and snapped it on. The small gang of boys\r\nregarded him with something like awe.\r\n\r\n\"How come no girls?\" Suzanne said as she interviewed him while he took\r\na smoke-break. Perry had banned cigarettes from all indoor workshops,\r\nnominally to keep flames away from the various industrial chemicals\r\nand such, but really just to encourage the shantytowners to give up\r\nthe habit that they couldn't afford anyway. He'd also leaned on the\r\nshantytowners who'd opened up small shops in their houses to keep cigs\r\nout of the town, without a lot of success.\r\n\r\n\"Girls aren't interested in this stuff, lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think?\" There was a time when she would have objected, but it was\r\nbetter to let these guys say it out loud, hear themselves say it.\r\n\r\n\"No. Maybe where you come from, OK? Don't know. But here girls are\r\ndifferent. They do good in school but when they have babies they're\r\ndone. I mean, hey, it's not like I don't *want* girls in the team,\r\nthey'd be great. I love girls. They fuckin' *work*, you know. No\r\nbullshit, no screwing around. But I know every girl in this place and\r\nnone of 'em are even interested, OK?\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne cocked one eyebrow just a little and Jason shifted\r\nuncomfortably. He scratched his bare midriff and shuffled. \"I do, all\r\nof them. Why would they? One girl, a roomful of boys, it'd be\r\ngross. They'd act like jerks. There's no way we'd get anything done.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne lifted her eyebrow one hair higher. He squirmed harder.\r\n\r\n\"So all right, that's not their fault. But I got enough work, all\r\nright? Too much to do without spending time on that. It's not like any\r\ngirls have *asked* to join up. I'm not keeping them out.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne jotted a couple of notes, keeping perfectly mum.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'd like to have them in the workshop, OK? Maybe I should ask\r\nsome of them if they'd come. Shit, if I can teach these apes, I can\r\nteach a girl. They're smart. Girls'd make this place a little better\r\nto work in. Lots of them trying to support their families, so they\r\nneed the money, too.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a girl there by the afternoon. The next day, there were two\r\nmore. They seemed like quick studies, despite their youth and their\r\nlip-gloss. Suzanne approved.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nLester stayed long enough to see the first prototype printer-printers\r\nrunning, then he lit out with a duffel bag jammed into the back of his\r\nmodded Smart car. \"Where are you going?\" Suzanne said as Perry looked\r\non gloomily. \"I'll come and visit you. I want to follow your story.\"\r\nTruth be told, she was sorry to see him go, very sorry. He was such a\r\nrock, such an anchor for Perry's new crazy pirate energy and for the\r\nmadness around them. He hadn't given much notice (not to her -- Perry\r\ndidn't seem that surprised).\r\n\r\n\"I can't really talk about it,\" he said. \"Nondisclosure.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it's a new job,\" she said. \"You're going to work for Tjan?\" Tjan's\r\nWestinghouse operation was fully rocking. He had fifty teams up the\r\neastern seaboard, ten in the midwest and was rumored to have twice as\r\nmany in Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nHe grinned. \"Oh, Suzanne, don't try to journalist me.\" He reached out\r\nand hugged her in a cloud of her father's cologne. \"You're fantastic,\r\nyou know that? No, I'm not going to a job. It's a thing that's an\r\namazing opportunity, you know?\"\r\n\r\nShe didn't, but then he was gone and boy did she miss him.\r\n\r\nPerry and she went out for dinner in Miami the next night with a PhD\r\ncandidate from Pepperdine's B-school, eating at the same deco patio\r\nthat she'd dined at with Tjan. Perry wore a white shirt open to reveal\r\nhis tangle of wiry chest hair and the waitress couldn't keep her eyes\r\noff of him. He had a permanent squint now, and a scar that made his\r\neyebrow into a series of small hills.\r\n\r\n\"I was just in Greensboro, Miss,\" the PhD candidate said. He was in\r\nhis mid-twenties, young and slick, his only nod to academe a small\r\ngoatee. \"I used to spend summers there with my grandpa.\" He talked\r\nfast, flecks of spittle in the corners of his mouth, eyes wide, fork\r\nstabbing blindly at the bits of crab-cake on his plate. \"There wasn't\r\n*anything* left there, just a couple gas-stations and a 7-Eleven,\r\nshit, they'd even closed the Wal-Mart. But now, but now, it's *alive*\r\nagain, it's buzzing and hopping. Every empty storefront is full of\r\npeople playing and tinkering, just a little bit of money in their\r\npockets from a bank or a company or a fund. They're doing the dumbest\r\nthings, mind you: tooled-leather laptop cases, switchblade knives with\r\nthumb drives in the handles, singing and dancing lawn-Santas that\r\nyodel like hillbillies.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd buy a tooled-leather laptop case,\" Perry said, swilling a sweaty\r\nbottle of beer. He waggled his funny eyebrow and rubbed his fuzzy\r\nscalp.\r\n\r\n\"The rate of employment is something like ninety-five percent, which\r\nit hasn't been in like a hundred years. If you're not inventing stuff,\r\nyou're keeping the books for someone who is, or making sandwiches for\r\nthem, or driving delivery vehicles around. It's like a tiny,\r\ndistributed gold rush.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or like the New Deal,\" Suzanne said. That was how she'd come to\r\ninvite him down, after she'd read his paper coining the term New Work\r\nto describe what Perry was up to, comparing it to Roosevelt's\r\npublic-investment plan that spent America free of the Depression.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, exactly, exactly! I've got research that shows that one in five\r\nAmericans is employed in the New Work industry. Twenty percent!\"\r\n\r\nPerry's lazy eye opened a little wider. \"No way,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Way,\" the PhD candidate said. He finished his caipirinha and shook\r\nthe crushed ice at a passing waiter, who nodded and ambled to the bar\r\nto get him a fresh one. \"You should get on the road and write about\r\nsome of these guys,\" he said to Suzanne. \"They need some ink, some\r\nphosphors. They're pulling up stakes and moving to the small towns\r\ntheir parents came from, or to abandoned suburbs, and just *doing\r\nit*. Bravest fucking thing you've seen in your life.\"\r\n\r\nThe PhD candidate stayed out the week, and went home with a suitcase\r\nfull of the parts necessary to build a three-d printer that could\r\nprint out all of the parts necessary to build a three-d printer.\r\n\r\nLester emailed her from wherever it was he'd gone, and told her about\r\nthe lovely time he was having. It made her miss him sharply. Perry was\r\nhardly ever around for her now, buried in his work, buried with the\r\nkids from the shantytown and with Francis. She looked over her last\r\nmonth's blogs and realized that she'd been turning in variations on\r\nthe same theme for all that time. She knew it was time to pack a\r\nduffel bag of her own and go see the bravest fucking thing she'd seen\r\nin her life.\r\n\r\n\"Bye, Perry,\" she said, stopping by his workbench. He looked up at her\r\nand saw the bag and his funny eyebrow wobbled.\r\n\r\n\"Leaving for good?\" he said. He sounded unexpectedly bitter.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" she said. \"No! Just a couple weeks. Going to get the rest of the\r\nstory. But I'll be back, count on it.\"\r\n\r\nHe grunted and slumped. He was looking a lot older now, and beaten\r\ndown. His hair, growing out, was half grey, and he'd gotten gaunt, his\r\ncheekbones and forehead springing out of his face. On impulse, she\r\ngave him a hug like the ones she'd shared with Lester. He returned it\r\nwoodenly at first, then with genuine warmth. \"I will be back, you\r\nknow,\" she said. \"You've got plenty to do here, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"Course I do.\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed him firmly on the cheek and stepped out the door and into\r\nher car and drove to Miami International.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nTjan met her at Logan and took her bag. \"I'm surprised you had the\r\ntime to meet me,\" she said. The months had been good to him, slimming\r\ndown his pot-belly and putting a twinkle in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a good organization,\" he said, as they motored away toward\r\nRhode Island, through strip-mall suburbs and past boarded-up chain\r\nrestaurants. Everywhere there were signs of industry: workshops in old\r\nstorefronts, roadside stands selling disposable music players, digital\r\nwhoopee cushions, and so forth. \"I barely have to put in an\r\nappearance.\"\r\n\r\nTjan yawned hugely and constantly. \"Jet-lag,\" he apologized. \"Got back\r\nfrom Russia a couple days ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see your kids?\" she said. \"How's business there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw my kids,\" he said, and grinned. \"They're amazing, you know\r\nthat? Good kids, unbelievably smart. Real little operators. The older\r\none, Lyenitchka, is running a baby-sitting service -- not baby-sitting\r\nherself, you see, but recruiting other kids to do the sitting for her\r\nwhile she skims a management fee and runs the quality control.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's your daughter all right,\" she said. \"So tell me everything\r\nabout the Westinghouse projects.\"\r\n\r\nShe'd been following them, of course, lots of different little\r\nstartups, each with its own blogs and such. But Tjan was quite\r\nfearless about taking her through their profits and losses and taking\r\nnotes on it all kept her busy until she reached her hotel. Tjan\r\ndropped her off and promised to pick her up the next morning for a VIP\r\ntour of the best of his teams, and she went to check in.\r\n\r\nShe was in the middle of receiving her key when someone grabbed her\r\nshoulder and squeezed it. \"Suzanne bloody Church! What are you doing\r\nhere, love?\"\r\n\r\nThe smell of his breath was like a dead thing, left to fester. She\r\nturned around slowly, not wanting to believe that of all the hotels in\r\nrural Rhode Island, she ended up checking into the same one as\r\nRat-Toothed Freddy.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Freddy,\" she said. Seeing him gave her an atavistic urge to stab\r\nhim repeatedly in the throat with the hotel stick-pen. He was\r\nunshaven, his gawky Adam's apple bobbing up and down, and he swallowed\r\nand smiled wetly. \"Nice to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fantastic to see you, too! I'm here covering a shareholder meeting\r\nfor Westinghouse, is that what you're here for, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said. She knew the meeting was on that week, but hadn't\r\nplanned on attending it. She was done with press conferences,\r\npreferring on-the-ground reporting. \"Well, nice to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do stay for a drink,\" he said, grinning more widely, exposing\r\nthose grey teeth in a shark's smile. \"Come on -- they have a free\r\ncocktail hour in this place. I'll have to report you to the\r\njournalist's union if you turn down a free drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think 'bloggers' have to worry about the journalist's union,\"\r\nshe said, making sarcastic finger-quotes in case he didn't get the\r\nmessage. He still didn't. He laughed instead.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, love, I'm sure they'll still have you even if you have lapsed\r\naway from the one true faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Freddy,\" was all she could manage to get out without\r\nactually hissing through her teeth.\r\n\r\n\"OK, good night,\" he said, moving in to give her a hug. As he loomed\r\ntoward her, she snapped.\r\n\r\n\"Freeze, mister. You are not my friend. I do not want to touch\r\nyou. You have poor personal hygiene and your breath smells like an\r\noverflowing camp-toilet. You write vicious personal attacks on me and\r\non the people I care about. You are unfair, meanspirited, and you\r\nwrite badly. The only day I wouldn't piss on you, Freddy, is the day\r\nyou were on fire. Now get the fuck out of my way before I kick your\r\ntiny little testicles up through the roof of your reeking mouth.\"\r\n\r\nShe said it quietly, but the desk-clerks behind her overheard it\r\nanyway and giggled. Freddy's smile only wobbled, but then returned,\r\nbroader than ever.\r\n\r\n\"Well said,\" he said and gave her a single golf-clap. \"Sleep well,\r\nSuzanne.\"\r\n\r\nShe boiled all the way to her room and when she came over hungry, she\r\nordered in room service, not wanting to take the chance that\r\nRat-Toothed Freddy would still be in the lobby.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nTjan met her as she was finishing her coffee in the breakfast\r\nroom. She hadn't seen Freddy yet.\r\n\r\n\"I've got five projects slated for you to visit today,\" Tjan said,\r\nsliding into the booth beside her. Funnily now that he was in the cold\r\nnortheast, he was dressing like a Floridian in blue jeans and a\r\nHawai'ian barkcloth shirt with a bright spatter of pineapples and\r\nOscar Mayer Wienermobiles. Back in Florida, he'd favored unflattering\r\nnylon slacks and white shirts with ironed collars.\r\n\r\nThe projects were fascinating and familiar. The cultural differences\r\nthat distinguished New England New Work from Florida New Work were\r\nsmall but telling: a lot more woodcraft, in a part of the country\r\nwhere many people had grown up in their grandfathers' woodworking\r\nshops. A little more unreflexive kitsch, like the homely kittens and\r\npuppies that marched around the reactive, waterproof, smash-proof\r\nscreens integrated into a bio-monitoring crib.\r\n\r\nAt the fourth site, she was ambushed by a flying hug. Tjan laughed as\r\nshe nearly went down under the weight of a strong, young woman who\r\nflung her arms around Suzanne's neck. \"Holy *crap* it's good to see\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne untangled herself and got a look at her hugger. She had short\r\nmousy hair, twinkling blue eyes, and was dressed in overalls and a\r\npretty flowered blouse, scuffed work boots and stained and torn\r\nwork-gloves. \"Uh...\" she said, then it clicked. \"Fiona?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah! Didn't Tjan tell you I was here?\" The last time she'd seen this\r\nwoman, she was weeping over pizza and getting ready to give up on\r\nlife. Now she was practically vibrating.\r\n\r\n\"Uh, no,\" she said, shooting a look at Tjan, who was smiling like the\r\nBuddha and pretending to inspect a pair of shoes with gyroscopically\r\nstabilized retractable wheels in the heels.\r\n\r\n\"I've been here for months! I went back to Oregon, like you told me\r\nto, and then I saw a recruiting ad for Westinghouse and I sent them my\r\nCV and then I got a videoconference interview and then, bam, I was on\r\nan airplane to Rhode Island!\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne blinked. *I* told you to go back to Oregon? Well, maybe she\r\nhad. That was a lifetime ago.\r\n\r\nThe workshop was another dead mall, this one a horseshoe of\r\nstorefronts separated by flimsy gyprock. The Westinghousers had cut\r\nthrough the walls with drywall knives to join all the stores\r\ntogether. The air was permeated with the familiar\r\nSaran-Wrap-in-a-microwave tang of three-d printers. The parking lot\r\nwas given over to some larger apparatus and a fantastical children's\r\njungle-gym in the shape of a baroque, spired pirate fortress, with\r\nelegantly curved turrets, corkscrew sky-bridges, and flying buttresses\r\ncrusted over with ornate, grotesque gargoyles. Children swarmed over\r\nit like ants, screeching with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you're looking really good, Fiona,\" Suzanne said. *Still not\r\ngreat with people*, she thought. Fiona, though, was indeed looking\r\ngood, and beaming. She wasn't wearing the crust of cosmetics and\r\nhair-care products she'd affected in the corporate Silicon Valley\r\nworld. She glowed pink.\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne,\" Fiona said, getting serious now, taking her by the\r\nshoulders and looking into her eyes. \"I can't thank you enough for\r\nthis. This has saved my life. It gave me something to live for. For\r\nthe first time in my life, I am doing something I'm proud of. I go to\r\nbed every night thankful and happy that I ended up here. Thank you,\r\nSuzanne. Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne tried not to squirm. Fiona gave her another long hug. \"It's\r\nall your doing,\" Suzanne said at last. \"I just told you about\r\nit. You've made this happen for you, OK?\"\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" Fiona said, \"but I still wouldn't be here if it wasn't for\r\nyou. I love you, Suzanne.\"\r\n\r\nIck. Suzanne gave her another perfunctory hug and got the hell out of\r\nDodge.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\n\"What's with the jungle-gym?\" It really had been something, fun and\r\nMartian-looking.\r\n\r\n\"That's the big one,\" Tjan said with a big grin. \"Most people don't\r\neven notice it, they think it's daycare or something. Well, that's how\r\nit started out, but then some of the sensor people started noodling\r\nwith jungle-gym components that could tell how often they were played\r\nwith. They started modding the gym every night, adding variations on\r\nthe elements that saw the most action, removing the duds. Then the CAD\r\npeople added an algorithm that would take the sensor data and generate\r\nrandom variations on the same basis. Finally, some of the robotics\r\npeople got in on the act so that the best of the computer-evolved\r\ndesigns could be instantiated automatically: now it's a self-modifying\r\njungle-gym. The kids love it. It is the crack cocaine of jungle-gyms,\r\nthough we won't be using that in the marketing copy, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" Suzanne said drily. She'd automatically reached for her\r\nnotepad and started writing when Tjan started talking. Now, reviewing\r\nher notes, she knew that she was going to have to go back and get some\r\nphotos of this. She asked Tjan about it.\r\n\r\n\"The robots go all night, you know. Not much sleep if you do that.\"\r\n\r\nNo going back to the hotel to see Freddy, what a pity. \"I'll grab a\r\ncouple blankets from the hotel to keep warm,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you needn't,\" he said. \"That crew has a set of bleachers with\r\ngas-heaters for the night crew and their family to watch from. It's\r\npretty gorgeous, if you ask me.\"\r\n\r\nThey had a hasty supper of burgers at a drive-through and then went\r\nback to the jungle-gym project. Suzanne ensconced herself at someone's\r\nvacated desk for a couple hours and caught up on email before finally\r\nemerging as the sun was dipping swollen and red behind the mall. She\r\nset herself up on the bleachers, and Fiona found her with a thermos of\r\ncoffee and a flask of whisky. They snuggled under a blanket amid a\r\nsmall crowd of geeks, an outdoor slumber party under the gas-heaters'\r\nroar.\r\n\r\nGradually, the robots made an appearance. Most of them humped along\r\nlike inchworms, carrying chunks of new playground apparatus in coils\r\nof their long bodies. Some deployed manipulator arms, though they\r\ndidn't have much by way of hands at their ends. \"We just use\r\nrare-earth magnets,\" Fiona said. \"Less fiddly than trying to get\r\nartificial vision that can accurately grasp the bars.\"\r\n\r\nTjan nudged her and pointed to a new tower that was going up. The\r\nrobots were twisting around themselves to form a scaffold, while\r\nvarious of their number crawled higher and higher, snapping modular\r\npieces of high-impact plastic together with *snick* sounds that were\r\naudible over the whine of their motors.\r\n\r\nSuzanne switched on her camera's night-vision mode and got\r\nshooting. \"Where did you get all these robots?\"\r\n\r\nTjan grinned. \"It's an open design -- the EPA hired Westinghouse to\r\nbuild these to work on sensing and removing volatile organic compounds\r\non Superfund sites. Because we did the work for the government, we had\r\nto agree not to claim any design copyright or patents in the\r\noutcome. There's a freaking warehouse full of this stuff at\r\nWestinghouse, all kinds of crazy things that Westinghouse abandoned\r\nbecause they weren't proprietary enough and they were worried that\r\nthey'd have to compete on the open market if they tried to productize\r\nthem. Suits us just fine, though.\"\r\n\r\nThe field was aswarm with glinting metal inchworm robots now, shifting\r\nback and forth, boiling and roiling and picking up enormous chunks of\r\nclimber like cartoon ants carrying away a picnic basket. The\r\nplayground was being transformed before her eyes, in ways gross and\r\nsubtle, and it was enchanting to watch.\r\n\r\n\"Can I go out and have a look?\" she said. \"I mean, is it safe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Fiona said. \"Of course! Our robots won't harm you; they just\r\nnuzzle you and then change direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, try to stay out of their way,\" Tjan said. \"Some of that stuff\r\nthey're moving around is heavy.\"\r\n\r\nSo she waded out onto the playground and carefully picked her way\r\nthrough the robot swarm. Some crawled over her toes. A couple twined\r\nbetween her feet and nearly tripped her up and once she stepped on one\r\nand it went still and waited politely for her to step off.\r\n\r\nOnce in the thick of it all, she switched on her video and began to\r\nrecord through the night filter. Standing there amid the whirl and\r\nracket and undulating motion of the jungle gym as it reconfigured\r\nitself, she felt like she'd arrived at some posthuman future where the\r\nworld no longer needed her or her kind. Like humanity's creations had\r\nevolved past their inventors.\r\n\r\nShe was going to have to do a *lot* of writing before bed.\r\n\r\nFreddy was checking out in the lobby when Tjan dropped her off at\r\n5AM. It was impossible to sneak past him, and he gave her a nasty,\r\nbucktoothed smile as she passed by him. It distracted her and made the\r\nwriting come more slowly, but she was a pro and her readers had sent\r\nin a lot of kind mail, and there was one from Lester, still away on\r\nhis mysterious errand but sounding happier than he had in months,\r\npositively giddy.\r\n\r\nShe set the alarm-clock so that she could be awake for her next stop,\r\noutside of North Carolina's Research Triangle, where some local\r\nmillionaires had backed a dozen New Work teams.\r\n\r\nAnother three weeks of this stuff and she'd get to go home --\r\nFlorida. The condo was home now, and the junkyard. Hot and sticky and\r\ninventive and ever-changing. She fell asleep thinking of it and\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\nIt was two weeks more before Lester caught up with her, in Detroit of\r\nall places. Going back to the old place hadn't been her idea, she'd\r\nbeen dragged back by impassioned pleas from the local Ford and GM New\r\nWork teams, who were second-generation-unemployed, old rust-belt\r\nfamilies who'd rebooted with money from the companies that had wrung\r\ntheir profit from their ancestors and abandoned them.\r\n\r\nThe big focus in the rustbelt was eradicating the car. Some were\r\nbuilding robots that could decommission leaky gas-stations and crater\r\nout the toxic soil. Some were building car-disassembly plants that\r\nreclaimed materials from the old beasts' interiors. Between the Ford\r\nand GM teams with their latest bail-out and those funded by the UAW\r\nout of the settlements they'd won from the auto-makers, Detroit was\r\nspringing up anew.\r\n\r\nLester emailed her and said that he'd seen on her blog that she was\r\nheaded to Detroit, and did she want to meet him for dinner, being as\r\nhe'd be in town too?\r\n\r\nThey ate at Devil's Night, a restaurant in one of the reclaimed\r\nmansions in Brush Park, a neighborhood of wood-frame buildings that\r\nteenagers had all but burned to the ground over several decades' worth\r\nof Halloweens. In Detroit, Devil's Night was the pre-Halloween\r\ntradition of torching abandoned buildings, and all of Brush Park had\r\nbeen abandoned for years, its handsome houses attractive targets for\r\nmidnight firebugs.\r\n\r\nReclaiming these buildings was an artisanal practice of urethaning the\r\ncharred wood and adding clever putty, cement, and glass to preserve\r\nthe look of a burned out hulk while restoring structural\r\nintegrity. One entire floor of the restaurant was missing, having been\r\nreplaced by polished tempered one-way glass that let upstairs diners\r\nlook down on the bald spots and cleavage of those eating below.\r\n\r\nSuzanne showed up a few minutes late, having gotten lost wandering the\r\nstreets of a Detroit that had rewritten its map in the decades since\r\nshe'd left. She was flustered, and not just because she was running\r\nlate. There was a lingering awkwardness between her and Lester and her\r\nelation at seeing him again had an inescapable undercurrent of dread.\r\n\r\nWhen the waiter pointed out her table, she told him he was\r\nmistaken. Lester wasn't there, some stranger was: short-haired, burly,\r\nwith a few days' stubble. He wore a smart blazer and a loose striped\r\ncotton shirt underneath. He was beaming at her.\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHer jaw literally dropped. She realized she was standing with her\r\nmouth open and shut it with a snap. \"Lester?\" she said, wonderingly.\r\n\r\nHe got up, still smiling, even laughing a little, and gave her a\r\nhug. It was Lester all right. That smell was unmistakable, and those\r\nbig, warm paws he called hands.\r\n\r\nWhen he let go of her, he laughed again. \"Oh, Suzanne, I could *not*\r\nhave asked for any better reaction than this. *Thank you*.\" They were\r\ndrawing stares. Dazedly, she sat down. So did he.\r\n\r\n\"Lester?\" she said again.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's me,\" he said. \"I'll tell you about it over dinner. The\r\nwaiter wants to take our drink orders.\"\r\n\r\nTheatrically, she ordered a double Scotch. The waiter rattled off the\r\nspecials and Suzanne picked one at random. So did Lester.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" he said, patting his washboard tummy. \"You want to know how I\r\ngot to this in ten weeks, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I take notes?\" Suzanne said, pulling out her pad.\r\n\r\n\"Oh by all means,\" he said. \"I got a discount on my treatments on the\r\nbasis that you would end up taking notes.\"\r\n\r\nThe clinic was in St Petersburg, Russia, in a neighborhood filled with\r\nRussian dentists who catered to American health tourists who didn't\r\nwant to pay US prices for crowns. The treatment hadn't originated\r\nthere: The electromuscular stimulation and chemical therapy for\r\nskin-tightening was standard for rich new mothers in Hollywood who\r\nwanted to get rid of pregnancy bellies. The appetite-suppressing\r\nhormones had been used in the Mexican pharma industry for\r\nyears. Stem-cells had been an effective substitute for steroids when\r\nit came to building muscle in professional athletic circles the world\r\nround. Genomic therapy using genes cribbed from hummingbirds boosted\r\nmetabolism so that the body burned 10,000 calories a day sitting\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nBut the St Petersburg clinic had ripped, mixed and burned these\r\ndifferent procedures to make a single, holistic treatment that had\r\ndropped Lester from 400 to 175 pounds in ten weeks.\r\n\r\n\"Is that safe?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Everyone asks that,\" he said, laughing. \"Yeah, it's safe if they're\r\nmonitoring you and standing by with lots of diagnostic equipment. But\r\nif you're willing to take slower losses, you can go on a way less\r\nintensive regime that won't require supervision. This stuff is the\r\nnext big grey-market pharma gold. They're violating all kinds of\r\npharma patents, of course, but that's what Cuba and Canada are for,\r\nright? Inside of a year, every fat person in America is going to have\r\na bottle of pills in his pocket, and inside of two years, there won't\r\nbe any fat people.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"You look... Lester, you look *incredible*. I'm so\r\nproud of you.\"\r\n\r\nHe ducked his head. He really did look amazing. Dropping the weight\r\nhad taken off ten years, and between that and the haircut and the new\r\nclothes, he was practically unrecognizable.\r\n\r\n\"Does Perry know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Lester said. \"I talked it over with him before I opted for\r\nit. Tjan had mentioned it in passing, it was a business his ex-wife\r\nwas tangled up with through her mafiyeh connections, and once I had\r\nresearched it online and talked to some people who'd had the\r\ntreatment, including a couple MDs, I decided to just do it.\"\r\n\r\nIt had cost nearly everything he'd made from Kodacell, but it was a\r\nsmall price to pay. He insisted on getting dinner.\r\n\r\nAfterward, they strolled through the fragrant evening down Woodward\r\nAvenue, past the deco skyscrapers and the plowed fields and community\r\ngardens, their livestock pens making soft animal noises.\r\n\r\n\"It's wonderful to see you again, Lester,\" she said truthfully. She'd\r\nreally missed him, even though his participation on her message boards\r\nhad hardly let up (though it had started coming in at weird hours,\r\nsomething explained by the fact that he'd been in Russia). Walking\r\nalongside of him, smelling his smell, seeing him only out of the\r\ncorner of her eye, it was like nothing had changed.\r\n\r\n\"It's great to see you again too.\" Tentatively, he took her hand in\r\nhis big paw. His hand was warm but not sweaty, and she realized it had\r\nbeen a long time since anyone had held her hand. Heart pounding, she\r\ngave his hand a squeeze.\r\n\r\nTheir conversation and their walk rambled on, with no outward\r\nacknowledgment of the contact of hand on hand, but her hand squeezed\r\nhis softly now and again, or he squeezed hers, and then they were at\r\nher hotel. *How did that happen?* she asked herself.\r\n\r\nBut then they were having a nightcap, and then he was in the elevator\r\nwith her and then he was at the door of her room, and the blood was\r\nroaring in her ears as she stuck her credit-card in the reader to open\r\nit.\r\n\r\n*Wait*, she tried to say. *Lester, hang on a second,* is what she\r\n tried to say, but her tongue was thick in her mouth. He stepped\r\n through the door with her, then said, \"Uh, I need to use the\r\n bathroom.\"\r\n\r\nWith relief, she directed him to the small water closet. The room was\r\nbasic -- now that she was her own boss, she wasn't springing for\r\nCrowne Plazas and Hiltons, this was practically a coffin -- and there\r\nwas nowhere to sit except the bed. Her laptop was open and there was a\r\nlot of email in her inbox, but for once, she didn't care. She was\r\nkeenly attuned to the water noises coming from behind the door, each\r\nnew sound making her jump a little. What was he doing in there,\r\ninserting a fucking diaphragm?\r\n\r\nShe heard him work the latch on the door and she put on her best\r\nsmile. Her stomach was full of butterflies. He smiled back and sat\r\ndown on the bed next to her, taking her hand again. His hand was moist\r\nfrom being washed, and a little slippery. She didn't mind. Wordlessly,\r\nshe put her head on his barrel chest. His heart was racing, and so was\r\nhers.\r\n\r\nGradually, they leaned back, until they were side by side on the bed,\r\nher head still on his chest. Moving like she was in a dream, she\r\nlifted her head from his chest and stared into his eyes. They were\r\nwide and scared. She kissed him, softly. His lips were trembling and\r\nunyielding. She kissed him more insistently, running her hands over\r\nhis chest and shoulders, putting one leg over him. He closed his eyes\r\nand kissed her back. He wasn't bad, but he was scared or nervous and\r\nall jittery.\r\n\r\nShe kissed his throat, breathing in the smell, savoring the rough\r\ntexture of his three-day beard. Tentatively, he put his hands on her\r\nback, stroked her, worked gradually towards her bottom. Then he\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she said, propping herself up on her forearms, still\r\nstraddling him.\r\n\r\nShe saw that there were tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Lester? What's wrong?\"\r\n\r\nHe opened his mouth and then shut it. Tears slid off his face into his\r\nears. She blotted them with a corner of hotel-pillow.\r\n\r\nShe stroked his hair. \"Lester?\"\r\n\r\nHe gave out a choked sob and pushed her away. He sat up and put his\r\nface in his hands. His back heaved. She stroked his shoulders\r\ntentatively.\r\n\r\nFinally, he seemed to get himself under control. He sniffled.\r\n\r\n\"I have to go,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Lester, what's *wrong*?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't do this,\" he said. \"I...\"\r\n\r\n\"Just tell me,\" she said. \"Whatever it is, tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't want me before.\" He said it simply without accusation, but\r\nit stung like he'd slapped her in the face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lester,\" she said, moving to hug him, but he pushed her away.\r\n\r\n\"I have to go,\" he said, drawing himself up to his full height. He was\r\ntall, though he'd never seemed it before, but oh, he was tall, six\r\nfoot four or taller. He filled the room. His eyes were red and\r\nswollen, but he put on a smile for her. \"Thanks, Suzanne. It was\r\nreally good to see you again. I'll see you in Florida.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood up and moved quickly to him, stood on tiptoe to put her arms\r\naround his neck and hug him fiercely. He hugged her back and she\r\nkissed him on the cheek.\r\n\r\n\"I'll see you in Florida,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAnd then he was gone. She sat on the edge of her bed and waited for\r\ntears, but they didn't come. So she picked up her laptop and started\r\nto work through her mountain of email.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nWhen she saw him again, he was coming down the drive leading to the\r\nshantytown and the factory. She was having tea in the tea-room that\r\nhad opened in a corkscrew spire high above the rest of the\r\nshantytown. The lady who operated it called herself Mrs Torrence, and\r\nshe was exquisitely antique but by no means frail, and when she worked\r\nthe ropes on her dumbwaiter to bring up supplies from the loading area\r\non the ground, her biceps stood at attention like Popeye's. There was\r\na rumor that Mrs Torrence used to be a man, or still was, under her\r\nskirts, but Suzanne didn't pay attention to it.\r\n\r\nLester came down the drive grinning and bouncing on the balls of his\r\nfeet. Perry had evidently been expecting him, for he came racing\r\nthrough the shantytown and pelted down the roadway and threw himself\r\nat Lester, grabbing him in a crazy, exuberant, whooping hug. Francis\r\ngimped out a moment later and gave him a solemn handshake. She hadn't\r\nblogged their meeting in Detroit, so if Francis and Perry knew about\r\nLester's transformation, they'd found out without hearing it from her.\r\n\r\nShe finished recording the homecoming from Mrs Torrence's crow's nest,\r\nthen paid the grinning old bag and took the stairs two at a time,\r\nhurrying to catch up with Lester and his crowd.\r\n\r\nLester accepted her hug warmly but distantly, letting go a fraction of\r\na second before she did. She didn't let it get to her. He had drawn a\r\ncrowd now, with Francis's protege printer-techs in the innermost\r\ncircle, and he was recounting the story of his transformation. He had\r\nthem as spellbound as a roomful of Ewoks listening to C3PO.\r\n\r\n\"Shit, why don't we sell that stuff?\" Jason said. He'd taken a real\r\ninterest in the business end of their three-d printer project.\r\n\r\n\"Too much competition,\" Lester said. \"There are already a dozen shops\r\ntooling up to make bathtub versions of the therapy here in\r\nAmerica. Hundreds more in Eastern Europe. There just won't be any\r\nprofit in it by the time we get to market. Getting thin on the cheap's\r\ngoing to be *easy*. Hell, all it takes to do it is the stuff you'd use\r\nfor a meth lab. You can buy all that in a kit from a catalog.\"\r\n\r\nJason nodded, but looked unconvinced.\r\n\r\nSuzanne took Lester's return as her cue to write about his\r\ntransformation. She snapped more pics of him, added some video. He\r\ngave her ten minutes' description of the therapies he'd undergone, and\r\nnamed a price for the therapy that was substantially lower than a\r\ncouple weeks at a Hollywood fat-farm, and far more effective.\r\n\r\nThe response was amazing. Every TV news-crew in the greater Miami area\r\nmade a pilgrimage to their factory to film Lester working in a tight\r\nt-shirt over a three-d printer, wrangling huge vats of epoxy-mix goop\r\nin the sun with sweat beading over his big, straining biceps.\r\n\r\nHer message boards exploded. It seemed that a heretofore unsuspected\r\ncontingent of her growing readership was substantially obese. And they\r\nhad friends. Lester eventually gave up on posting, just so he could\r\nget some work done. They had the printers to the point where they\r\ncould turn out new printers, but the whole system was temperamental\r\nand needed careful nursing. Lester was more interested in what people\r\nhad to say on the engineering message-boards than chatting with the\r\nfatties.\r\n\r\nThe fatties were skeptical and hopeful in equal measures. The big\r\nfight was over whether there was anything to this, whether Lester\r\nwould keep the weight off, whether the new skinny Lester was really\r\nLester, whether he'd undergone surgery or had his stomach\r\nstapled. America's wallets had been cleaned out by so many snake-oil\r\npeddlers with a \"cure\" for obesity that no one could believe what they\r\nsaw, no matter how much they wanted to.\r\n\r\nLord, but it was bringing in the readers, not to mention the\r\nadvertising dollars. The clearing price for a thousand weight-loss ads\r\ntargeted to affluent, obese English-speakers was over fifty bucks, as\r\ncompared with her customary CPM of three bucks a thou. Inside of a\r\nweek, she'd made enough to buy a car. It was weird being her own\r\ncirculation and ad-sales department, but it wasn't as hard as she'd\r\nworried it might be -- and it was intensely satisfying to have such a\r\nnose-to-tail understanding of the economics of her production.\r\n\r\n\"You should go,\" Lester told her as she clicked him through her\r\nearnings spreadsheet. \"Jesus, this is insane. You know that these\r\nfatties actually follow me around on the net now, asking me questions\r\nin message boards about engineering? The board moderators are asking\r\nme to post under an assumed name. Madame, your public has\r\nspoken. There is a dire need for your skills in St\r\nPetersburg. Go. They have chandeliers in the subways and caviar on\r\ntap. All the blini you can eat. Bear steaks.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and slurped at the tea he'd brought her. \"You're\r\njoking. It's all mafiyeh there. Scary stuff. Besides, I'm covering\r\nthis beat right now, New Work.\"\r\n\r\n\"New Work isn't going anywhere, Suzanne. We'll be here when you get\r\nback. And this story is one that needs your touch. They're\r\nmicro-entrepreneurs solving post-industrial problems. It's the same\r\nstory you've been covering here, but with a different angle. Take that\r\nmoney and buy yourself a business-class ticket to St Petersburg and\r\nspend a couple weeks on the job. You'll clean up. They could use the\r\npublicity, too -- someone to go and drill down on which clinics are\r\nlegit and which ones are clip-joints. You're perfect for the gig.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" she said. She closed her eyes. Taking big chances had\r\ngotten her this far and it would take her farther, she knew. The world\r\nwas your oyster if you could stomach a little risk.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"Yeah, hell yeah. You're totally right, Lester.\"\r\n\r\n\"Zasterovyeh!\"\r\n\r\n\"What you said!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's cheers,\" he said. \"You'll need to know that if you're going to\r\nmake time in Petrograd. Let me go send some email and get you set\r\nup. You book a ticket.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nAnd just like that she was off to Russia. Lester insisted that she buy\r\na business-class ticket, and she discovered to her bemusement that\r\nBritish Airways had about three classes above business, presumably\r\nwith even more exclusive classes reserved to royalty and peers of the\r\nrealm. She luxuriated in fourteen hours of reclining seats and warm\r\npeanuts and in-flight connectivity, running a brief videoconference\r\nwith Lester just because she could. Tjan had sent her a guide to the\r\nhotels and she'd opted for the Pribaltiyskaya, a crumbling Stalin-era\r\nfour-star of spectacular, Vegasesque dimensions. The facade revealed\r\nthe tragedy of the USSR's unrequited love-affair with concrete, as did\r\nthe cracks running up the walls of the lobby.\r\n\r\nThey checked her into the hotel with the nosiest questionnaire ever, a\r\ntwo-pager on government stationary that demanded to know her\r\nprofession, employer, city of birth, details of family, and so\r\nforth. An American businessman next to her at the check-in counter saw\r\nher puzzling over it. \"Just make stuff up,\" he said. \"I always write\r\nthat I come from 123 Fake Street, Anytown, California, and that I work\r\nas a professional paper-hanger. They don't check on it, except maybe\r\nthe mob when they're figuring out who to mug. First time in Russia?\"\r\n\r\n\"It shows, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"You get used to it,\" he said. \"I come here every month on\r\nbusiness. You just need to understand that if it seems ridiculous and\r\ntoo bad to be true, it is. They have lots of rules here, but no one\r\nfollows 'em. Just ignore any unreasonable request and you'll fit right\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good advice,\" she said. He was middle-aged, but so was she,\r\nand he had nice eyes and no wedding ring.\r\n\r\n\"Get a whole night's sleep, don't drink the so-called 'champagne' and\r\ndon't change money on the streets. Did you bring melatonin and\r\nmodafinil?\"\r\n\r\nShe stared blankly at him. \"Drugs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. One tonight to sleep, one in the morning to wake up, and do it\r\nagain tomorrow and you'll be un-lagged. No booze or caffeine, either,\r\nnot for the first couple days. Melatonin's over the counter, even in\r\nthe States, and modafinil's practically legal. I have extra, here.\" He\r\ndug in his travel bag and came up with some generic Walgreens bottles.\r\n\r\n\"That's OK,\" she said, handing her credit card to a pretty young\r\nclerk. \"Thanks, though.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"It's your funeral,\" he said. \"Jet-lag is way worse\r\nfor you than this stuff. It's over the counter stateside. I don't\r\nleave home without it. Anyway, I'm in room 1422. If it's two in the\r\nmorning and you're staring at the ceiling and regretting it, call me\r\nand I'll send some down.\"\r\n\r\nWas he hitting on her? Christ, she was so tired, she could barely see\r\nstraight. There was no way she was going to need any help getting to\r\nsleep. She thanked him again and rolled her suitcase across the\r\ncavernous lobby with its gigantic chandeliers and to the elevators.\r\n\r\nBut sleep didn't come. The network connection cost a fortune --\r\nsomething she hadn't seen in years -- and the number of worms and\r\nprobes bouncing off her firewall was astronomical. The connection was\r\nslow and frustrating. Come 2AM, she was, indeed, staring at the\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\nWould you take drugs offered by a stranger in a hotel lobby? They were\r\nin a *Walgreens bottle* for chrissakes. How bad could they be? She\r\npicked up the house-phone on the chipped bedstand and punched his\r\nhotel room.\r\n\r\n\"Lo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh Christ, I woke you up,\" she said. \"I'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Sok. Lady from check-in, right? Gimme your room number, I'll send up\r\na melatonin now and a modafinil for the morning. No sweatski.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh,\" she hadn't thought about giving a strange man her room\r\nnumber. In for a penny, in for a pound. \"2813,\" she said. \"Thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Geoff,\" he said. \"It's Geoff. New York -- upper West Side. Work in\r\nhealth products.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne,\" she said. \"Florida, lately. I'm a writer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Suzanne. Pills are en route.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Geoff. Thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tip the porter a euro, or a couple bucks. Don't bother with rubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she said. It had been a long time since her last visit\r\noverseas. She'd forgotten how much minutiae was involved.\r\n\r\nHe hung up. She put on a robe and waited. The porter took about\r\nfifteen minutes, and handed her a little envelope with two pills in\r\nit. He was about fifteen, with a bad mustache and bad skin, and bad\r\nteeth that he displayed when she handed him a couple of dollar bills.\r\n\r\nA minute later, she was back on the phone.\r\n\r\n\"Which one is which?\"\r\n\r\n\"Little white one is melatonin. That's for now. My bad.\"\r\n\r\nShe saw him again in the breakfast room, loading a plate with\r\nhard-boiled eggs, potato pancakes, the ubiquitous caviar, salami, and\r\ncheeses. In his other hand he balanced a vat of porridge with\r\nstrawberry jam and enough dried fruit to keep a parrot zoo happy for a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\"How do you keep your girlish figure if you eat like that?\" she said,\r\nsettling down at his table.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's a professional matter,\" he said. \"And I make it a point\r\nnever to discuss bizniz before I've had two cups of coffee.\" He poured\r\nhimself a cup of decaf. \"This is number two.\"\r\n\r\nShe picked her way through her cornflakes and fruit salad. \"I always\r\nfeel like I don't get my money's worth out of buffet breakfasts,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" he said. \"I'll make up for you.\" He pounded his coffee\r\nand poured another cup. \"Humanity returns,\" he said, rubbing his\r\nthighs. \"Marthter, the creature waketh!\" he said in high Igor.\r\n\r\nShe laughed.\r\n\r\n\"You are really into, uh, *substances*, aren't you?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I am a firm believer in better living through chemistry,\" he said. He\r\npounded another coffee. \"Ahhh. Coffee and modafinil are an amazing\r\ncombo.\"\r\n\r\nShe'd taken hers that morning when the alarm got her up. She'd been so\r\ntired that it actually made her feel nauseated to climb out of bed,\r\nbut the modafinil was getting her going. She knew a little about the\r\ndrug, and figured that if the TSA approved it for use by commercial\r\npilots, it couldn't be that bad for you.\r\n\r\n\"So, my girlish figure. I work for a firm that has partners here in\r\nPetersburg who work on cutting-edge pharma products, including some\r\nstuff the FDA is dragging its heels on, despite widespread acceptance\r\nin many nations, this one included. One of these is a pill that\r\noverclocks your metabolism. I've been on it for a year now, and even\r\nthough I am a stone calorie freak and pack away five or six thousand\r\ncalories a day, I don't gain an ounce. I actually have to remember to\r\neat enough so that my ribs don't start showing.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne watched him gobble another thousand calories. \"Is it healthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Compared to what? Being fat? Yes. Running ten miles a day and eating\r\na balanced diet of organic fruit and nuts? No. But when the average\r\nAmerican gets the majority of her calories from soda-pop, 'healthy' is\r\na pretty loaded term.\"\r\n\r\nIt reminded her of that talk with Lester, a lifetime ago in the\r\nIHOP. Slowly, she found herself telling him about Lester's story.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a second, you're Suzanne *Church*? New Work Church? San Jose\r\nMercury News Church?\"\r\n\r\nShe blushed. \"You can't *possibly* have heard of me,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe rolled his eyes. \"Sure. I shoulder-surfed your name off the\r\ncheck-in form and did a background check on you last night just so I\r\ncould chat you up over breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a joke, but it gave her a funny, creeped-out feeling. \"You're\r\nkidding?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm kidding.  I've been reading you for freaking *years*. I followed\r\nLester's story in detail. Professional interest. You're the voice of\r\nour generation, woman. I'd be a philistine if I didn't read your\r\ncolumn.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not making me any less embarrassed, you know.\" It took an\r\neffort of will to keep from squirming.\r\n\r\nHe laughed hard enough to attract stares. \"All right, I *did* spend\r\nthe night googling you. Better?\"\r\n\r\n\"If that's the alternative, I'll take famous, I suppose,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"You're here writing about the weight loss clinics, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said. It wasn't a secret, but she hadn't actually gone out\r\nof her way to mention it. After all, there might not be any kind of\r\nstory after all. And somewhere in the back of her mind was the idea\r\nthat she didn't want to tip off some well-funded newsroom to send out\r\nits own investigative team and get her scoop.\r\n\r\n\"That is fantastic,\" he said. \"That's just, wow, that's the best news\r\nI've had all year. You taking an interest in our stuff, it's going to\r\nreally push it over the edge. You'd think that selling weight-loss to\r\nAmericans would be easy, but not if it involves any kind of travel: 80\r\npercent of those lazy insular fucks don't even have\r\npassports. Ha. Don't quote that. Ha.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha,\" she said. \"Don't worry, I won't. Look, how about this, we'll\r\nmeet in the lobby around nine, after dinner, for a cup of coffee and\r\nan interview?\" She had gone from intrigued to flattered to creeped-out\r\nwith this guy, and besides, she had her first clinic visit scheduled\r\nfor ten and it was coming up on nine and who knew what a Russian\r\nrush-hour looked like?\r\n\r\n\"Oh. OK. But you've got to let me schedule you for a visit to some of\r\nour clinics and plants -- just to see what a professional shop we run\r\nhere. No gold-teeth-shiny-suit places like you'd get if you just\r\npicked the top Google AdWord. Really American-standard places, better\r\neven, Scandinavian-standard, a lot of our doctors come over from\r\nSweden and Denmark to get out from under the socialist medicine\r\nsystems there. They run a tight ship, ya shore, you betcha,\" he\r\ndelivered this last in a broad Swedish bork-bork-bork.\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" she said. \"It all depends on scheduling. Let's sort it out\r\ntonight, OK?\"\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" he said. \"Can't *wait*.\" He stood up with her and gave her a\r\nlong, two-handed handshake. \"It's a real honor to meet you,\r\nSuzanne. You're one of my real heros, you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" she said again. \"Thanks, Geoff.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to sense that he'd come on too strong. He looked like he was\r\nabout to apologize.\r\n\r\n\"That's really kind of you to say,\" she said. \"It'll be good to catch\r\nup tonight.\"\r\n\r\nHe brightened. It was easy enough to be kind, after all.\r\n\r\nShe had the front desk call her a taxi -- she'd been repeatedly warned\r\noff of gypsy cabs and any vehicle that one procured by means of a\r\nwandering tout. She got into the back, had the doorman repeat the\r\ndirections to Lester's clinic twice to the cabbie, watched him switch\r\non the meter and checked the tariff, then settled in to watch St\r\nPetersburg go flying by.\r\n\r\nShe switched on her phone and watched it struggle to associate with a\r\nRussian network. They were on the road for all of five minutes -- long\r\nenough to note the looming bulk of the Hermitage and the ripples left\r\nby official cars slicing through the traffic with their blue blinking\r\nlights -- when her phone went nutso. She looked at it -- she had ten\r\ntexts, half a dozen voicemails, a dozen new clipped articles, and it\r\nwas ringing with a number in New York.\r\n\r\nShe bumped the New York call to voicemail. She didn't recognize the\r\nnumber. Besides, if the world had come to an end while she was asleep,\r\nshe wanted to know some details before she talked to anyone about\r\nit. She paged back through the texts in reverse chronological -- the\r\nlast five were increasingly panicked messages from Lester and\r\nPerry. Then one from Tjan. Then one from Kettlebelly. They all wanted\r\nto discuss \"the news\" whatever that was. One from her old editor at\r\nthe Merc asking if she was available for comment about \"the news.\"\r\nTjan, too. The first one was from Rat-Toothed Freddy, that snake.\r\n\r\n\"Kodacell's creditors calling in debts. Share price below one\r\ncent. Imminent NASDAQ de-listing. Comments?\"\r\n\r\nHer stomach went cold, her breakfast congealed into a hard lump. The\r\nclipped articles had quotes from Kettlewell (\"We will see to it that\r\nall our employees are paid, our creditors are reimbursed, and our\r\nshareholders are well-done-by through an orderly wind-down\"), Perry\r\n(\"Fuck it -- I was doing this shit before Kodacell, don't expect to\r\nstop now\") and Lester (\"It was too beautiful and cool to be real, I\r\nguess.\") Where she was mentioned, it was usually in a snide context\r\nthat made her out to be a disgraced pitchwoman for a failed movement.\r\n\r\nWhich she was. Basically.\r\n\r\nHer phone rang. Kettlewell.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Kettlewell,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been?\" he said. He sounded really edgy. It was the\r\nmiddle of the night in California.\r\n\r\n\"I'm in St Petersburg,\" she said. \"In Russia. I only found out about\r\nten seconds ago. What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh Christ. Who knows? Cascading failure. Fell short of last quarter's\r\nestimates, which started a slide. Then a couple lawsuits filed. Then\r\nsome unfavorable press. The share price kept falling, and things got\r\nworse. Your basic clusterfuck.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you guys had great numbers overall --\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, if you looked at them our way, they were great. If you looked\r\nat them the way the Street looks at them, we were in deep\r\nshit. Analysts couldn't figure out how to value us. Add a little\r\nmarket chaos and some old score-settling assholes, like that fucker\r\nFreddy, and it's a wonder we lasted as long as we did. They're already\r\ncalling us the twenty first century Enron.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kettlewell,\" she said, \"I lived through a couple of these, and\r\nsomething's not right. When the dotcoms were going under, their CEOs\r\nkept telling everyone everything was all right, right up to the last\r\nminute. They didn't throw in the towel. They stood like captains on\r\nthe bridge of sinking ships.\"\r\n\r\n\"So?\"\r\n\r\n\"So what's going on here. It sounds like you're whipped. Why aren't\r\nyou fighting? There were lots of dotcoms that tanked, but a few of\r\nthose deep-in-denial CEOs pulled it off, restructured and came out of\r\nit alive. Why are you giving up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne, oh, Suzanne.\" He laughed, but it wasn't a happy laugh. \"You\r\nthink that this happened overnight? You think that this problem just\r\ncropped up yesterday and I tossed in the towel?\"\r\n\r\nOh. \"Oh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. We've been tanking for months. I've been standing on the bridge\r\nof this sinking ship with my biggest smile pasted on for two\r\nconsecutive quarters now. I've thrown out the most impressive reality\r\ndistortion field the business world has ever seen. Just because I'm\r\ngiving up doesn't mean I gave up without a fight.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne had never been good at condolences. She hated\r\nfunerals. \"Landon, I'm sorry. It must have been very hard --\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"Well, sure. I wanted you to have the scoop on this,\r\nbut I had to talk to the press once the story broke, you understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" she said. \"Scoops aren't that important anyway. I'll\r\ntell you what. I'll post a short piece on this right away, just\r\nsaying, 'Yes, it's true, and I'm getting details.' Then I'll do\r\ninterviews with you and Lester and Perry and put up something longer\r\nin a couple of hours. Does that work?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed again, no humor in it. \"Yeah, that'll be *fine*.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Kettlewell.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" he said. \"No, it's OK.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look, I just want to write about this in a way that honors what\r\nyou've done over the past two years. I've never been present at the\r\nbirth of anything remotely this important. It deserves to be described\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nIt sounded like he might be crying. There was a snuffling\r\nsound. \"You've been amazing, Suzanne. We couldn't have done it without\r\nyou. No one could have described it better. Great deeds are irrelevant\r\nif no one knows about them or remembers them.\"\r\n\r\nHer phone was beeping. She snuck a peek. It was her old\r\neditor. \"Listen,\" she said. \"I have to go. There's a call coming in I\r\n*have* to take. I can call you right back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't,\" he said. \"It's OK. I'm busy here anyway. This is a big day.\"\r\nHis laugh was like a dog's bark.\r\n\r\n\"Take care of yourself, Kettlewell,\" she said. \"Don't let the bastards\r\ngrind you down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nil carborundum illegitimis to you, too.\"\r\n\r\nShe clicked over to her editor. \"Jimmy,\" she said. \"Long time no\r\nspeak. Sorry I missed your calls before -- I'm in Russia on a story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Suzanne,\" he said. His voice had an odd, strained quality, or\r\nmaybe that was just her mood, projecting. \"I'm sorry, Suzanne. You've\r\nbeen doing good work. The best work of your career, if you ask me. I\r\nfollow it closely.\"\r\n\r\nIt made her feel a little better. She'd been uncomfortable about the\r\nway she and Jimmy had parted ways, but this was vindicating. It\r\nemboldened her. \"Jimmy, what the hell do I do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ, Suzanne, I don't know. I'll tell you what not to do,\r\nthough. Off the record.\"\r\n\r\n\"Off the record.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do what I've done. Don't hang grimly onto the last planks from\r\nthe sinking ship, chronicling the last few struggling, sinking\r\nschmucks' demise. It's no fun being the stenographer for the fall of a\r\ngreat empire. Find something else to cover.\"\r\n\r\nThe words made her heart sink. Poor Jimmy, stuck there in the Merc's\r\nonce-great newsroom, while the world crumbled around him. It must have\r\nbeen heartbreaking.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said. \"You want an interview?\"\r\n\r\n\"What? No, woman. I'm not a ghoul. I wanted to call and make sure you\r\nwere all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jimmy, you're a prince. But I'll be OK. I land on my feet. You've got\r\nsomeone covering this story, so give her my number and have her call\r\nme and I'll give her a quote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Suzanne --\"\r\n\r\n\"It's *fine*, Jimmy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne,\" he said. \"We don't cover that kind of thing from our\r\nnewsroom anymore. Just local stuff. National coverage comes from the\r\nwires or from the McClatchy national newsroom.\"\r\n\r\nShe sucked in air. Could it be possible? Her first thought when Jimmy\r\ncalled was that she'd made a terrible mistake by leaving the Merc, but\r\nif this was what the paper had come to, she had left just in time,\r\neven if her own life-raft was sinking, it had kept her afloat for a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\"The offer still stands, Jimmy. I'll talk to anyone you want to\r\nassign.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a sweetheart, Suzanne. What are you in Russia for?\"\r\n\r\nShe told him. Screw scoops, anyway. Not like Jimmy was going to send\r\nanyone to *Russia*, he couldn't even afford to dispatch a reporter to\r\nMarin County by the sounds of things.\r\n\r\n\"What a story!\" he said. \"Man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"Yeah I guess it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"You *guess*? Suzanne, this is the single most important issue in\r\npractically every American's life -- there isn't one in a thousand who\r\ndoesn't worry endlessly about his weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have been getting really good numbers on this.\" She named the\r\nfigure. He sucked air between his teeth. \"That's what the whole\r\nfreaking *chain* does on a top story, Suzanne. You're outperforming\r\nfifty local papers *combined.*\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell yeah,\" he said. \"Maybe I should ask you for a job.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he got off the phone, she spoke to Perry, and then to\r\nLester. Lester said that he wanted to go traveling and see his old\r\nfriends in Russia and that if she was still around in a couple weeks,\r\nmaybe he'd see her there. Perry was morose and grimly determined. He\r\nwas on the verge of shipping his three-d printers and he was sure he\r\ncould do it, even if he didn't have the Kodacell network for marketing\r\nand logistics. He didn't even seem to register it when she told him\r\nthat she was going to be spending some time in Russia.\r\n\r\nThen she had to go into the clinic and ask intelligent questions and\r\ntake pictures and record audio and jot notes and pay attention to the\r\nsmall details so that she would be able to write the best account\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThey dressed well in Russia, in the clinics. Business casual, but well\r\ntailored and made from good material. The Europeans knew from\r\ntextiles, and expert tailoring seemed to be in cheap supply here.\r\n\r\nShe'd have to get someone to run her up a blue blazer and a white\r\nshirt and a decent skirt. It would be nice to get back into grown-up\r\nclothes after a couple years' worth of Florida casual.\r\n\r\nShe'd see Geoff after dinner that night, get more detail for the\r\nstory. There was something big here in the medical tourism angle --\r\nnot just weight loss but gene therapy, too, and voodoo stem-cell stuff\r\nand advanced prostheses and even some crazy performance enhancement\r\nstuff that had kept Russia out of the past Olympics.\r\n\r\nShe typed her story notes and answered the phone calls. One special\r\ncall she returned once she was sitting in her room, relaxed, with a\r\ncup of coffee from the in-room coffee-maker.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Freddy,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne, darling!\" He sounded like he was breathing hard.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just wanted a quote, love, something for color.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've got a quote for you.\" She'd given the quote a lot of\r\nthought. Living with the squatters had broadened her vocabulary\r\nmagnificently.\r\n\r\n\"And those are your good points,\" she said, taking a sip of\r\ncoffee. \"Goodbye, Freddy.\"\r\n\r\n$$$$\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nThe drive from Orlando down to Hollywood got worse every time Sammy\r\ntook it. The turnpike tolls went up every year and the road surface\r\nquality declined, and the gas prices at the clip-joints were\r\nheart-attack-inducing. When Sammy started at Disney Imagineering a\r\ndecade before, the company had covered your actual expenses -- just\r\ncollect the receipts and turn them in for cash back. But since Parks\r\nhad been spun off into a separate company with its own shareholders,\r\nthe new austerity measures meant that the bean-counters in Burbank set\r\na maximum per-mile reimbursement and never mind the actual expense.\r\n\r\nEnough of this competitive intelligence work and Sammy would go broke.\r\n\r\nOff the turnpike, it was even worse. The shantytowns multiplied and\r\nmultiplied. Laundry lines stretched out in the parking-lots of former\r\nstrip-malls. Every traffic-light clogged with aggressive\r\ntechno-tchotchke vendors, the squeegee bums of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, with their pornographic animatronic dollies and infinitely\r\nvaried robot dogs. Disney World still sucked in a fair number of\r\ntourists (though not nearly so many as in its golden day), but they\r\nwere staying away from Miami in droves. The snowbirds had died off in\r\na great demographic spasm over the past decade, and their children\r\nlacked the financial wherewithal to even think of over-wintering in\r\ntheir parents' now-derelict condos.\r\n\r\nThe area around the dead Wal-Mart was particularly awful. The shanties\r\nhere rose three, even four stories into the air, clustered together to\r\nmake medieval street-mazes. Broward County had long since stopped\r\nenforcing the property claims of the bankruptcy courts that managed\r\nthe real-estate interests of the former owners of the fields and malls\r\nthat had been turned into the new towns.\r\n\r\nBy the time he pulled into the Wal-Mart's enormous parking lot, the\r\nday had heated up, his air-con had conked, and he'd accumulated a\r\ncomet-tail of urchins who wanted to sell him a computer-generated bust\r\nof himself in the style of a Roman emperor -- they worked on affiliate\r\ncommission for some three-d printer jerk in the shanties, and they had\r\na real aggressive pitch, practically flinging their samples at him.\r\n\r\nHe pushed past them and wandered through the open-air market stalls, a\r\nkind of cruel parody of the long-gone Florida flea-markets. These\r\ngypsies sold fabricated parts that could be modded to make single-shot\r\nzip guns and/or bongs and/or illegal-gain wireless antennae. They sold\r\nfruit smoothies and suspicious \"beef\" jerky. They sold bootleg\r\nhardcopies of Mexican fotonovelas and bound printouts of Japanese\r\nfan-produced tentacle-porn comics. It was all damnably eye-catching\r\nand intriguing, even though Sammy knew that it was all junk.\r\n\r\nFinally, he reached the ticket-window in front of the Wal-Mart and\r\nslapped down five bucks on the counter. The guy behind the counter was\r\nthe kind of character that kept the tourists away from Florida:\r\nshaven-headed, with one cockeyed eyebrow that looked like a set of\r\nhills, a three-day beard and skin tanned like wrinkled leather.\r\n\r\n\"Hi again!\" Sammy said, brightly. Working at Disney taught you to talk\r\nhappy even when your stomach was crawling -- the castmember's grin.\r\n\r\n\"Back again?\" the guy behind the counter laughed. He was missing a\r\ncanine tooth and it made him look even more sketchy. \"Christ, dude,\r\nwe'll have to invent a season's pass for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just can't stay away,\" Sammy said.\r\n\r\n\"You're not the only one. You're a hell of a customer for the ride,\r\nbut you haven't got anything on some of the people I get here --\r\npeople who come practically every day. It's flattering, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You made this, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said, swelling up with a little pigeon-chested puff of\r\npride. \"Me and Lester, over there.\" He gestured at a fit, greying man\r\nsitting on a stool before a small cocktail bar built into a scavenged\r\nOrange Julius stand -- God knew where these people got all their crap\r\nfrom. He had the look of one of the fatkins, unnaturally thin and\r\nmuscled and yet somehow lazy, the combination of a ten kilocalorie\r\ndiet, zero body-fat and non-steroidal muscle enhancers. Ten years ago,\r\nhe would have been a model, but today he was just another ex-tubbalard\r\nwith a serious food habit. Time was that Disney World was\r\nnigh-unnavigable from all the powered wheelchairs carting around\r\nmorbidly obese Americans who couldn't walk from ride to ride, but\r\nthese days it looked more like an ad for a gymnasium, full of\r\ngenerically buff fatkins in tight-fitting clothes.\r\n\r\n\"Good work!\" he said again in castmemberese. \"You should be very\r\nproud!\"\r\n\r\nThe proprietor smiled and took a long pull off a straw hooked into the\r\ndistiller beside him. \"Go on, get in there -- flatterer!\"\r\n\r\nSammy stepped through the glass doors and found himself in an\r\nair-conditioned cave of seemingly infinite dimension. The old Wal-Mart\r\nhad been the size of five football fields, and a cunning arrangement\r\nof curtains and baffles managed to convey all that space without\r\nrevealing its contents. Before him was the ride vehicle, in a single\r\nshaft of spotlight.\r\n\r\nGingerly, he stepped into it. The design was familiar -- there had\r\nbeen a glut of these things before the fatkins movement took hold,\r\nstair-climbing wheelchairs that used gyro-stabilizers to pitch, yaw,\r\nstand and sit in a perpetual controlled fall. The Disney World\r\nveterans of their heyday remembered them as failure-prone behemoths\r\nthat you needed a forklift to budge when they died, but the ride\r\npeople had done something to improve on the design. These things\r\nperformed as well as the originals, though they were certainly\r\nknock-offs -- no*how* were these cats shelling out fifty grand a pop\r\nfor the real deal.\r\n\r\nThe upholstered seat puffed clouds of dust into the spotlight's shaft\r\nas he settled into the chair and did up his lap-belt. The little LCD\r\nset into the control panel lit up and started to play the standard\r\nvideo spiel, narrated in grizzled voice-over.\r\n\r\nWELCOME TO THE CABINET OF WONDERS\r\n\r\nTHERE WAS A TIME WHEN AMERICA HELD OUT THE PROMISE OF A NEW WAY OF\r\nLIVING AND WORKING.

It had been a mere\r\nfour days since he'd been up here, but like so many other of his\r\nvisits, they'd made major rehabs to their ride in the amount of time\r\nit would have taken Imagineering to write a memo about the possibility\r\nof holding a design-review meeting.\r\n\r\nHe velcroed his camera's wireless eye to his lapel, tapped the preset\r\nto correct for low light and motion, and hit the joystick. The\r\nwheelchair stood up with wobbly grace, and began to roll forward on\r\ntwo wheels, heeling over precipitously as it cornered into the main\r\nspace of the ride. The gyros could take it, he knew, but it still\r\nthrilled him the way that a fast, out-of-control go-kart did, miles\r\naway from the safe rides back in Disney.\r\n\r\nThe chair screeched around a corner and pulled into the first scene, a\r\ndiorama littered with cross-sectioned cars. Each one was kitted out\r\nwith different crazy technologies -- dashboard gods that monitored and\r\ntransmitted traffic heuristics, parallel-parking autopilots,\r\npeer-to-peer music-sharing boxes, even an amphibious retrofit on a\r\nlittle hybrid that apparently worked, converting the little Bug into a\r\nwater-Bug.\r\n\r\nThe chair swooped around each one, pausing while the narration played\r\nback reminisces by the inventors, or sometimes by the owners of the\r\nold gizmos. The stories were pithy and sweet and always funny. These\r\nwere artifacts scavenged from the first days of a better nation that\r\nhad died a-borning.\r\n\r\nThen on to the kitchen, and the bathrooms -- bathroom after bathroom,\r\nwith better toilets, better showers, better tubs, better floors and\r\nbetter lights -- bedrooms, kids' rooms. One after another, a hyper\r\nmuseum.\r\n\r\nThe decor was miles ahead of where it had been the last time he'd been\r\nthrough. There were lots of weird grace-notes, like taxidermied\r\nalligators, vintage tourist pennants, chintz lamps, and tiny dioramae\r\nof action figures.\r\n\r\nHe paused in front of a fabric printer surrounded by custom tees and\r\nknit caps and three-d video-game figurines machine-crocheted from\r\nbright yarns, and was passed by another chair. In it was a cute woman\r\nin her thirties, white-blond shaggy hair luminous in the spotlight\r\nover the soft-goods. She paused her chair and lovingly reached out to\r\nset down a pair of appliqued shorts with organic LEDs pulsing and\r\nswirling around the waistband. \"Give it a plus-one, OK? These were my\r\nbest sellers,\" she said, smiling a dazzling beach-bunny smile at\r\nhim. She wheeled away and paused at the next diorama to set down a\r\ndoll-house in a child's room diorama.\r\n\r\nWow -- they were getting user-generated content in the *ride*. Holy\r\ncrap.\r\n\r\nHe finished out the ride with a keen hand on the plus-one/minus-one\r\nlever, carefully voting for the best stuff and against the stuff that\r\nlooked out of place -- like a pornographic ceramic bong that someone\r\nhad left in the midst of a clockwork animatronic jug-band made from\r\nstitched-together stuffed animals.\r\n\r\nThen it was over, and he was debarking in what had been the Wal-Mart's\r\ngarden center. The new bright sun made him tear up, and he fished out\r\nhis shades.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, mister, c'mere, I've got something better than sunglasses for\r\nyou!\" The guy who beckoned him over to a market-stall had the look of\r\nan aging bangbanger: shaved head, tattoos, ridiculous cycling shorts\r\nwith some gut hanging over them.\r\n\r\n\"See these? Polarizing contact-lenses -- prescription or optically\r\nneutral. Everyone in India is into these things, but we make 'em right\r\nhere in Florida.\" He lifted a half-sphere of filmy plastic from his\r\ncase and peeled back his eyelid and popped it in. His whole iris was\r\ntinted black, along with most of the whites of his eyes. Geometric\r\nshapes like Maori tattoos were rendered in charcoal grey across the\r\nlenses. \"I can print you up a set in five minutes, ten bucks for\r\nplain, twenty if you want them bit-mapped.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I'll stick with my shades, thanks,\" Sammy said.\r\n\r\n\"C'mon, the ladies love these things. Real conversation starter. Make\r\nyou look all anime and shit, guy like you can try this kind of thing\r\nout for twenty bucks, you know, won't hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" Sammy said.\r\n\r\n\"Just try a pair on, then, how about that. I printed an extra set last\r\nWednesday and they've only got a shelf-life of a week, so these'll\r\nonly be good for another day. Fresh in a sealed package. You like\r\n'em. you buy a pair at full price, c'mon that's as good as you're\r\ngoing to get.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Sammy knew it, he was taking receipt of a sealed plastic packet\r\nin hot pink with a perforated strip down one side. \"Uh, thanks...\" he\r\nsaid, as he began to tuck it into a pocket. He hated hard-sells, he\r\nwas no good at them. It was why he bought all his cars online now.\r\n\r\n\"Naw, that's not the deal, you got to try them on, otherwise how can\r\nyou buy them once you fall in love with 'em? They're safe man, go on,\r\nit's easy, just like putting in a big contact lens.\"\r\n\r\nSammy thought about just walking away, but the other vendors were\r\nwatching him now, and the scrutiny sapped his will. \"My hands are too\r\ndirty for this,\" he said. The vendor silently passed him a sealed\r\nsterile wipe, grinning.\r\n\r\nKnowing he was had, he wiped his hands, tore open the package, took\r\nout the lenses and popped them one at a time into his eyes. He blinked\r\na couple times. The world was solarized and grey, like he was seeing\r\nit through a tinted windscreen.\r\n\r\n\"Oh man, you look bad-*ass*,\" the vendor said. He held up a hand\r\nmirror.\r\n\r\nSammy looked. His eyes were shiny black beads, like a mouse's eyes,\r\nsolid save for a subtle tracery of Mickey Mouse heads at the\r\ncorners. The trademark infringement made him grin, hard and\r\nspitless. He looked ten years younger, like those late-teen hipsters\r\nwhose parents dragged them to Walt Disney World, who showed up in\r\nbangbanger threads and sneered and scratched their groins and made\r\nloud remarks about how suckballs it all was. His conservative buzz-cut\r\nlooked more like a retro-skinhead thing, and his smooth-shaved, round\r\ncheeks made him boyish.\r\n\r\n\"Those are good for two days tops -- your eyes start getting itchy,\r\nyou just toss 'em. You want a pair that's good for a week, twenty\r\ndollah with the Mickeys. I got Donalds and Astro Boys and all kinds of\r\nshit, just have a look through my flash book. Some stuff I drew\r\nmyself, even.\"\r\n\r\nPlaying along now, Sammy let himself be led on a tour of the\r\nflash-book, which featured the kind of art he was accustomed to seeing\r\nin tattoo parlor windows: skulls and snakes and scorpions and naked\r\nladies. Mickey Mouse giving the finger, Daisy Duck with a strap-on,\r\nMinnie Mouse as a dominatrix. The company offered a bounty for turning\r\nin trademark infringers, but somehow he doubted that the company\r\nlawyers would be able to send this squatter a cease-and-desist letter.\r\n\r\nIn the end, he bought one of each of the Disney sets.\r\n\r\n\"You like the mouse, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I never been. Too expensive. This is all the ride I want, right\r\nhere.\" He gestured at the dead Wal-Mart.\r\n\r\n\"You like that huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Man, it's cool! I go on that sometimes, just to see what it's turned\r\ninto. I like that it's always different. And I like that people add\r\ntheir own stuff. It makes me feel, you know...\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the vendor dropped his hard-case bangbanger facade. \"Those\r\nwere the best days of my life. I was building three-d printers, making\r\nthem run. My older brother liked to fix cars, and so did my old man,\r\nbut who needs a car, where you going to go? The stuff I built, man, it\r\ncould make *anything*. I don't know why or how it ended, but while it\r\nwas going, I felt like the king of the goddamned world.\"\r\n\r\nIt felt less fun and ironic now. There were tears bright on the\r\nvendor's black-bead eyes. He was in his mid-twenties, younger than\r\nhe'd seemed at first. If he'd been dressed like a suburban home-owner,\r\nhe would have looked like someone smart and accomplished, with lively\r\nfeatures and clever hands. Sammy felt obscurely ashamed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Well, I spent those years working a straight job, so\r\nit didn't really touch me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's your loss, man,\" the vendor said. The printer behind him was\r\nspitting out the last of Sammy's contact-lenses, in sealed plastic\r\nwrap. The vendor wrapped them up and put them in a brown liquor-store\r\nbag.\r\n\r\nSammy plodded through the rest of the market with his paper bag. It\r\nwas all so depressing. The numbers at Disney World were down, way\r\ndown, and it was his job to figure out how to bring them up again,\r\nwithout spending too much money. He'd done it before a couple of\r\ntimes, with the live-action role-playing stuff, and with the rebuild\r\nof Fantasyland as an ironic goth hangout (being a wholly separate\r\nentity from the old Walt Disney Company had its advantages). But to do\r\nit a third time -- Christ, he had no idea how he'd get there. These\r\nweird-ass Wal-Mart squatters had seemed promising, but could you\r\npossibly transplant something like this to a high-throughput,\r\nprofessional location-based entertainment product?\r\n\r\nThe urchins were still in the parking lot with their Roman emperor\r\nbusts. He held his hands out to ward them off and found himself\r\nholding onto a bust of his own head. One of the little rats had gotten\r\na three-d scan of his head while he was walking by and had made the\r\nbust on spec. He looked older in Roman emperor guise than he did in\r\nhis mind's eye, old and tired, like an emperor in decline.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty dollah man, twenty, twenty,\" the kid said. He was about 12,\r\nand still chubby, with long hair that frizzed away from his head in a\r\ndandelion halo.\r\n\r\n\"Ten,\" Sammy said, clutching his tired head. It was smooth as epoxy\r\nresin, and surprisingly light. There was a lot of different goop you\r\ncould run through those three-d printers, but whatever they'd used for\r\nthis, it was featherweight.\r\n\r\nThe kid looked shrewd. \"Twenty dollah and I get rid of these other\r\nkids, OK?\"\r\n\r\nSammy laughed. He passed the kid a twenty, taking care to tuck his\r\nwallet deep into the inside pocket of his jacket. The kid whistled\r\nshrilly and the rest of the kids melted away. The entrepreneur made\r\nthe twenty disappear, tapped the side of his nose, and took off\r\nrunning back into the market stalls.\r\n\r\nIt was hot and muggy and Sammy was tired, and the drive back to\r\nOrlando was another five hours if the traffic was against him -- and\r\nthese days, everything was against him.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nPerry's funny eyebrow twitched as he counted out the day's take. This\r\ngig was all cream, all profit. His overheads amounted to a couple\r\nhundred a month to Jason and his crew to help with the robot and\r\nmachinery maintenance in the Wal-Mart, half that to some of the\r\nshantytown girls to dust and sweep after closing, and a retainer to a\r\nbangbanger pack that ran security at the ride and in the market. Plus\r\nhe got the market-stall rents, and so when the day was over, only the\r\nfirst hundred bucks out of the till went into overheads and the rest\r\nsplit even-steven with Lester.\r\n\r\nLester waited impatiently, watching him count twice before splitting\r\nthe stack. Perry rolled up his take and dropped it into a hidden\r\npocket sewn into his cargo shorts.\r\n\r\n\"Someday you're going to get lucky and some chick is going to reach\r\ndown and freak out, buddy,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"Better she finds my bank-roll than my prostate,\" Perry said. Lester\r\nspent a lot of time thinking about getting lucky, making up for a\r\nlifetime of bad luck with girls.\r\n\r\n\"OK, let's get changed,\" Lester said. As usual, he was wearing\r\ntight-fitting jeans that owed a little debt to the bangbanger cycling\r\nshorts, something you would have had to go to a gay bar to see when\r\nPerry was in college. His shirt clung to his pecs and was tailored\r\ndown to his narrow waist. It was a fatkins style, the kind of thing\r\nyou couldn't wear unless you had a uniquely adversarial relationship\r\nwith your body and metabolism.\r\n\r\n\"No, Lester, no.\" Perry said. \"I said I'd go on this double date with\r\nyou, but I didn't say anything about letting you dress me up for it.\"\r\nThe two girls were a pair that Lester had met at a fatkins club in\r\nSouth Beach the week before, and he'd camera-phoned their pic to Perry\r\nwith a scrawled drunken note about which one was his. They were\r\nattractive enough, but the monotonic fatkins devotion to sybartism was\r\nso tiresome. Perry didn't see much point in hooking up with a girl he\r\ncouldn't have a good technical discussion with.\r\n\r\n\"Come *on*, it's good stuff, you'll love it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I have to change clothes, I'm not interested.\" Perry folded his\r\narms. In truth, he wasn't interested, period. He liked his little\r\nkingdom there, and he could get everything he needed from burritos to\r\nRAM at the market. He had a chest freezer full of bankruptcy sale\r\norganic MREs, for variety.\r\n\r\n\"Just the shirt then -- I had it printed just for you.\"\r\n\r\nPerry raised his funny eyebrow. \"Let's see it.\"\r\n\r\nLester turned to his latest car, a trike with huge, electric blue back\r\ntires, and popped the trunk, rummaged, and proudly emerged holding a\r\nbright blue Hawai'ian print shirt.\r\n\r\n\"Lester, are those . . . turds?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's transgressivist moderne,\" Lester said, hopping from foot to\r\nfoot. \"Saw it in the New York Times, brought the pic to Gabriela in\r\nthe market, she cloned it, printed it, and sent it out for stitching\r\n-- an extra ten buck for same-day service.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am *not* wearing a shirt covered in steaming piles of shit,\r\nLester. No, no, no. A googol times no.\"\r\n\r\nLester laughed. \"Christ, I had you going, didn't I? Don't worry, I\r\nwouldn't actually have let you go out in public wearing this. But how\r\nabout *this*?\" he said with a flourish, and brought out another\r\nshirt. Something stretchy and iridescent, like an oil-slick. It was\r\nsleeveless. \"It'll really work with your biceps and pecs. Also: looks\r\npretty good compared to the turd shirt, doesn't it? Go on, try it on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lester Banks, you are the gayest straight man I know,\" Perry said. He\r\nshucked his sweaty tee and slipped into the shirt. Lester gave him a\r\nbig thumbs-up. He examined his reflection in the blacked-out glass\r\ndoors of the Wal-Mart.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, OK,\" he said. \"Let's get this over with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your enthusiasm, your best feature,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\nTheir dates were two brunettes with deep tans and whole-eye cosmetic\r\ncontacts that hid their pupils in favor of featureless expanses of\r\nwhite, so they looked like their eyes had rolled back into their\r\nheads, or maybe like they were wearing cue-balls for glass eyes. Like\r\nmost of the fatkins girls Perry had met, they dressed to the nines,\r\nate like pigs, drank like fishes, and talked about nothing but\r\nbiotech.\r\n\r\n\"So I'm thinking, sure, mitochrondrial lengthening *sounds* like it\r\nshould work, but if that's so, why have we been screwing around with\r\nit for thirty years without accomplishing anything?\" His date, Moira,\r\nworked at a law office, and she came up to his chest, and it was hard\r\nto tell with those eyes, but it seemed like she was totally oblivious\r\nto his complete indifference to mitochondria.\r\n\r\nHe nodded and tried not to look bored. South Beach wasn't what it had\r\nonce been, or maybe Perry had changed. He used to love to come here to\r\npeople-watch, but the weirdos of South Beach seemed too precious when\r\ncompared with the denizens of his own little settlement out on the\r\nHollywood freeway.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go for a walk on the beach,\" Lester said, digging out his\r\nwallet and rubbing his card over the pay-patch on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Good idea,\" Perry said. Anything to get off this patio and away from\r\nthe insufferable club music thundering out of the speakers\r\npole-mounted directly over their table.\r\n\r\nThe beach was gorgeous, so there was that. The sunset behind them\r\nstained the ocean bloody and the sand was fine and clean. Around their\r\nfeet, Dade County beachcombers wormed endlessly through the sand,\r\nfiltering out all the gunk, cig butts, condoms, needles, wrappers,\r\nloose change, wedding rings, and forgotten sunglasses. Perry nudged\r\none with his toe and it roombaed away, following its instinct to avoid\r\nhuman contact.\r\n\r\n\"How do you figure they keep the vags from busting those open for\r\nwhatever they've got in their bellies?\" Perry said, looking over his\r\ndate's head at Lester, who was holding hands with his girl, carrying\r\nher shoes in his free hand.\r\n\r\n\"Huh? Oh, those things are built like tanks. Have to be to keep the\r\nsand out. You need about four hours with an air-hammer to bust one\r\nopen.\"\r\n\r\n\"You tried it?\"\r\n\r\nLester laughed. \"Who, me?\"\r\n\r\nNow it was Perry's date's turn to be bored. She wandered away toward\r\nthe boardwalk, with its strip of novelty sellers. Perry followed,\r\nbecause he had a professional interest in the kind of wares they\r\ncarried. Most of them originated on one of his printers, after\r\nall. Plus, it was the gentlemanly thing to do.\r\n\r\n\"What have we here?\" he said as he pulled up alongside her. She was\r\ntrying on a bracelet of odd, bony beads.\r\n\r\n\"Ectopic fetuses,\" she said. \"You know, like the Christian fundies use\r\nfor stem-cell research? You quicken an unfertilized egg in vitro and\r\nyou get a little ball of fur and bone and skin and stem-cells. It can\r\nnever be a human, so it has no soul, so it's not murder to harvest\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe vendor, a Turkish teenager with a luxurious mustache,\r\nnodded. \"Every bead made from naturally occurring foetus-bones.\" He\r\nhanded one to Perry.\r\n\r\nIt was dry and fragile in his hand. The bones were warm and porous,\r\nand in tortured Elephant Man shapes that he recoiled from\r\natavistically.\r\n\r\n\"Good price,\" the Turkish kid said. He had practically no accent at\r\nall, and was wearing a Japanese baseball-team uniform and spray-on\r\nfoot-coverings. Thoroughly Americanized. \"Look here,\" he said, and\r\ngestured at a little corner of his table.\r\n\r\nIt was covered in roses made from fabric -- small and crude, with\r\npin-backs. Perry picked one up. It had a certain naive charm. The\r\nfabric was some kind of very delicate leather --\r\n\r\n\"It's skin,\" his date said. \"Foetal skin.\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped it. His fingers tingled with the echo of the feeling of the\r\nleather. *Jesus I hate biotech*. The rose fluttered past the table to\r\nthe sandy boardwalk, and the Turkish kid picked it up and blew it\r\nclean.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry,\" Perry said, sticking his hands in his pockets. His date\r\nbought a bracelet and a matching choker made of tiny bones and teeth,\r\nand the Turkish kid, leering, helped her fasten the necklace. When\r\nthey returned to Lester and his date, Perry knew the evening was at a\r\nclose. The girls played a couple rounds of eye-hockey, unreadable\r\nbehind their lenses, and Perry shrugged apologetically at Lester.\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" Lester said, \"it sure has been a nice night.\" Lester got\r\nsmooched when they saw the girls off in a pedicab. In the buzz and hum\r\nof its flywheel, Perry got a damp and unenthusiastic handshake.\r\n\r\n\"Win some, lose some,\" Lester said as the girls rolled away in a flash\r\nof muscular calves from the pair of beach-perfect cabbies pedaling the\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\"You're not angry?\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"Nah,\" Lester said. \"I get laid too much as it is. Saps me of my\r\nprecious bodily fluids. Gotta keep some chi inside, you know?\"\r\n\r\nPerry raised up his funny eyebrow and made it dance.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, OK,\" Lester said. \"You got me. I'm meeting mine later, after she\r\ndrops her friend off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get a cab home then, shall I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take my car,\" Lester said. \"I'll get a ride back in the morning. No\r\nway you'll get a taxi to take you to our neighborhood at this hour.\"\r\n\r\nPerry's car had been up on blocks for a month, awaiting his attention\r\nto its failing brakes and mushy steering. So it was nice to get behind\r\nthe wheel of Lester's Big Daddy Roth trike and give it a little gas\r\nout on the interstate, the smell of the swamp and biodiesel from the\r\nbig rigs streaming past the windscreen. The road was dark and\r\ntreacherous with potholes, but Perry got into the rhythm of it and\r\nfound he didn't want to go home, quite, so he kept driving, into the\r\nnight. He told himself that he was scouting dead malls for future\r\nexpansion, but he had kids who'd video-documented the status of all\r\nthe likely candidates in the hood, and he kept tabs on his choicest\r\nmorsels via daily sat photos that he subscribed to in his morning\r\nfeed.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell was he doing with his life? The Wal-Mart ride was a lark\r\n-- it had been Lester's idea, but Lester had lost interest and Perry\r\nhad done most of the work. They weren't quite squatting the Wal-Mart:\r\nPerry paid rent to a state commission that collected in escrow for the\r\nabsentee landlord. It was a fine life, but the days blurred one into\r\nthe next, directionless. Building the ride had been fun, setting up\r\nthe market had been fun, but running them -- well, he might as well be\r\nrunning a laundromat for all the mental acuity his current job\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\"You miss it,\" he said to himself over the whistle of the wind and the\r\nhiss of the fat contact-patches on the rear tires. \"You want to be\r\nback in the shit, inventing stuff, making it all happen.\"\r\n\r\nFor the hundredth time, he thought about calling Suzanne Church. He\r\nmissed her, too, and not just because she made him famous (and now he\r\nwas no longer famous). She put it all in perspective for him, and\r\negged him on to greater things. She'd been their audience, and they'd\r\nall performed for her, back in the golden days.\r\n\r\nIt was, what, 5AM in Russia? Or was it two in the afternoon? He had\r\nher number on his speed-dial, but he never rang it. He didn't know\r\nwhat he'd tell her.\r\n\r\nHe could call Tjan, or even Kettlebelly, just ring them out of the\r\nblue, veterans together shooting the shit. Maybe they could have a\r\nKodacell reunion, and get together to sing the company song, wearing\r\nthe company t-shirt.\r\n\r\nHe pulled the car off at a truck stop and bought an ice-cream novelty\r\nfrom a vending machine with a robotic claw that scooped the ice-cream,\r\nmushed it into the cone, then gave it a haircut so that it looked like\r\nAstro Boy's head, then extended the cone on a robotic claw. It made\r\nhim smile. Someone had invented this thing. It could have been him. He\r\nknew where you could download vision-system libraries, and\r\nforce-feedback libraries. He knew where you could get plans for the\r\nrobotics, and off-the-shelf motors and sensors. Christ, these days he\r\nhad a good idea where you could get the ice-cream wholesale, and which\r\ncrooked vending-machine interests he'd have to grease to get his stuff\r\ninto truck-stops.\r\n\r\nHe was thirty four years old, he was single and childless, and he was\r\neating an ice-cream in a deserted truck-stop at two in the morning by\r\nthe side of a freeway in south Florida. He bossed a low-budget tourist\r\nattraction and he ran a pirate flea-market.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell was he doing with his life?\r\n\r\nGetting mugged, that's what.\r\n\r\nThey came out of the woods near the picnic tables, four bangbangers,\r\nbut young ones, in their early teens. Two had guns -- nothing fancy,\r\njust AK-47s run off a computer-controlled mill somewhere in an\r\nindustrial park. You saw them all over the place, easy as pie to make,\r\nbut the ammo was a lot harder to come by. So maybe they were unloaded.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of unloaded. He was about to piss his pants.\r\n\r\n\"Wallet,\" one of them said. He had a bad mustache that reminded him of\r\nthe Turkish kid on the beach. Probably the same hormones that gave\r\nkids mustaches gave them bad ideas like selling fetus jewelry or\r\nsticking up people by the ice-cream machines at late night\r\ntruck-stops. \"Keys,\" he said. \"Phone,\" he added.\r\n\r\nPerry slowly set down the ice-cream cone on the lid of the trash-can\r\nbeside him. He'd only eaten one spike off Astro-Boy's head.\r\n\r\nHis vision telescoped down so that he was looking at that kid, at his\r\nmustache, at the gun in his hands. He was reaching for his wallet,\r\nslowly. He'd need to hitch a ride back to town. Canceling the\r\ncredit-cards would be tough, since he'd stored all the identity-theft\r\npasswords and numbers in his phone, which they were about to take off\r\nhim. And he'd have to cancel the phone, for that matter.\r\n\r\n\"Do you have an older brother named Jason?\" his mouth said, while his\r\nhands were still being mugged.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Works a stall by the Wal-Mart ride, selling contact lenses?\"\r\n\r\nThe kid's eyes narrowed. \"You don't know me, man. You don't want to\r\nknow me. Better for your health if you don't know me.\"\r\n\r\nHis hands were passing over his phone, his wallet, his keys --\r\nLester's keys. Lester would be glad to have an excuse to build a new\r\ncar.\r\n\r\n\"Only I own the Wal-Mart ride, and I've known Jason a long time. I\r\ngave him his first job, fixing the printers. You look like him.\"\r\n\r\nThe kid's three buddies were beginning their slow fade into the\r\nbackground. The kid was visibly on the horns of a dilemma. The gun\r\nwavered. Perry's knees turned to water.\r\n\r\n\"You're that guy?\" the kid said. He peered closer. \"Shit, you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep it all,\" Perry said. His mouth wasn't so smart. Knowing who\r\nmugged you wasn't good for your health.\r\n\r\n\"Shit,\" the kid said. The gun wavered. Wavered.\r\n\r\n\"Come *on*,\" one of his buddies said. \"Come on, man!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be there in a minute,\" the kid said, his voice flat.\r\n\r\nPerry knew he was a dead man.\r\n\r\n\"I'm really sorry,\" the kid said, once his friends were out of range.\r\n\r\n\"Me too,\" said Perry.\r\n\r\n\"You won't tell my brother?\"\r\n\r\nPerry froze. Time dilated. He realized that his fists were clenched so\r\ntight that his knuckles hurt. He realized that he had a zit on the\r\nback of his neck that was rubbing against his collar. He realized that\r\nthe kid had a paperback book stuck in the waistband of his bangbanger\r\nshorts, which was unusual. It was a fantasy novel. A Conan novel. Wow.\r\n\r\nTime snapped back.\r\n\r\n\"I won't tell your brother,\" he said. Then he surprised himself, \"But\r\nyou've got to give me back the credit-cards and leave the car at the\r\nmarket in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe kid nodded. Then he seemed to realize he was holding a gun on\r\nPerry. He lowered it. \"Yeah, that's fair,\" he said. \"Can't use the\r\nfucking cards these days anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Perry said. \"Well, there's some cash there anyway.\" He\r\nrealized he had five hundred bucks in a roll in a hidden pocket in his\r\nshorts.\r\n\r\n\"You get home OK?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll thumb a ride,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"I can call you a taxi,\" the kid said. \"It's not safe to hang around\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's really nice of you,\" Perry said. \"Thanks.\"\r\n\r\nThe kid took out a little phone and prodded it for a minute. \"On the\r\nway,\" he said. \"The guns aren't loaded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well,\" Perry said. \"Good to know.\"\r\n\r\nAn awkward silence spread between them. \"Look, I'm really sorry,\" the\r\nkid said. \"We don't really do this. It's our first night. My brother\r\nwould really kill me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't tell him,\" Perry said. His heart was beating again, not\r\nthundering or keeping ominously still. \"But you know, this isn't\r\nsmart. You're going to stick someone up who has bullets and he's gonna\r\nshoot you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll get ammo,\" the kid said.\r\n\r\n\"And shoot him? That's only a little better, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you want me to say?\" the kid said, looking young and\r\npetulant. \"I apologized.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come by tomorrow with the car and let's talk, all right?\"\r\n\r\nLester didn't even notice that his car was missing until the kid drove\r\nup with it, and when he asked about it, Perry just raised his funny\r\neyebrow at him. That funny eyebrow, it had the power to cloud men's\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n\"What's your name?\" Perry asked the kid, giving him the spare stool by\r\nthe ticket-window. It was after lunch time, when the punishing heat\r\nslowed everyone to a sticky crawl, and the crowd was thin -- one or\r\ntwo customers every half hour.\r\n\r\n\"Glenn,\" the kid said. In full daylight, he looked older. Perry had\r\nnoticed that the shantytowners never stopped dressing like teenagers,\r\nwearing the fashions of their youths forever, so that a walk through\r\nthe market was like a tour through the teen fashions of the last\r\nthirty years.\r\n\r\n\"Glenn, you did me a real solid last night.\"\r\n\r\nGlenn squirmed on his stool. \"I'm sorry about that --\"\r\n\r\n\"Me too,\" Perry said. \"But not as sorry as I might have been. You said\r\nit was your first night. Is that true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Car-jacking, sure,\" the kid said.\r\n\r\n\"But you get into other shit, don't you? Mugging? Selling a little\r\ndope? Something like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everyone does that,\" Glenn said. He looked sullen.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" Perry said. \"And then a lot of them end up doing a stretch in\r\na work-camp. Sometimes they get bit by water-moccasins and don't come\r\nout. Sometimes, one of the other prisoners hits them over the head\r\nwith a shovel. Sometimes you just lose three to five years of your\r\nlife to digging ditches.\"\r\n\r\nGlenn said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not trying to tell you how to run your life,\" Perry said. \"But\r\nyou seem like a decent kid, so I figure there's more in store for you\r\nthan getting killed or locked up. I know that's pretty normal around\r\nhere, but you don't have to go that way. Your brother didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the fuck do you know about it, anyway?\" The kid was up now, body\r\nlanguage saying he wanted to get far away, fast.\r\n\r\n\"I could ask around the market,\" Perry said, as though the kid hadn't\r\nspoken. \"Someone here has got to be looking for someone to help\r\nout. You could open your own stall.\"\r\n\r\nThe kid said, \"It's all just selling junk to idiots. What kind of job\r\nis that for a man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Selling people stuff they can't be bothered to make for themselves is\r\na time-honored way of making a living. There used to be professional\r\nportrait photographers who'd take a pic of your family for money. They\r\nwere even considered artists. Besides, you don't have to sell stuff\r\nyou download. You can invent stuff and print that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get over it. Those days are over. No one cares about inventions\r\nanymore.\"\r\n\r\nIt nailed Perry between the eyes, like a slaughterhouse bolt. \"Yeah,\r\nyeah,\" he said. He didn't want to talk to this kid any more than this\r\nkid wanted to talk to him. \"Well, if I can't talk you out of it, it's\r\nyour own business. . .\" He started to rearrange his ticket-desk.\r\n\r\nThe kid saw his opportunity for freedom and bolted. He was probably\r\nheaded for his brother's stall and then the long walk to wherever he\r\nplanned on spending his day. Everything was a long walk from here, or\r\nyou could wait for the busses that ran on the hour during\r\nbusiness-hours.\r\n\r\nPerry checked out the car, cleaned out the empties and the roaches and\r\ntwists from the back seat, then parked it. A couple more people came\r\nby to ride his ride, and he took their money.\r\n\r\nLester had just finished his largest-ever flattened-soda-can\r\nmechanical computer, it snaked back and forth across the whole of the\r\nold Wal-Mart solarium, sheets of pressboard with precision-cut gears\r\nmounted on aviation bearings -- Francis had helped him with those. All\r\nday, he'd been listening to the racket of it grinding through its\r\nmighty 0.001KHz calculations, dumping carloads of M&Ms into its output\r\nhopper. You programmed it with regulation baseballs, footballs,\r\nsoccer-balls, and wiffleballs: dump them in the input hopper and they\r\nwould be sorted into the correct chutes to trigger the\r\noperations. With a whopping one kilobit of memory, the thing could\r\nbest any of the early vacuum tube computers without a single\r\nelectrical component, and Lester was ready to finally declare victory\r\nover the cursed Univac.\r\n\r\nPerry let himself be coaxed into the work-room, deputizing Francis to\r\nman the ticket-desk, and watched admiringly as Lester put the machine\r\nthrough its paces.\r\n\r\n\"You've done it,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I gotta blog it,\" Lester said. \"Run some benchmarks, really\r\ntest it out against the old monsters. I'm thinking of using it to\r\nbrute-force the old Nazi Enigma code. That'll show those dirty Nazi\r\nbastards! We'll win the war yet!\"\r\n\r\nPerry found himself giggling. \"You're the best, man,\" he said to\r\nLester. \"It's good that there's at least one sane person around here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't flatter yourself, Perry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was talking about *you*, Lester.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-oh,\" Lester said. He scooped a double handful of brown M&Ms up\r\nfrom the output hopper and munched them. \"It's not a good sign when\r\nyou start accusing me of being the grownup in our partnership. Have\r\nsome M&Ms and tell me about it.\"\r\n\r\nPerry did, unburdening himself to his old pal, his roommate of ten\r\nyears, the guy he'd gone to war with and started businesses with and\r\ncollaborated with.\r\n\r\n\"You're restless, Perry,\" Lester said. He put nine golf-balls, a\r\nping-pong ball, and another nine golf balls in the machine's input\r\nhopper. Two and a third seconds later, eighty one M&Ms dropped into\r\nthe output hopper. \"You're just *bored*. You're a maker, and you're\r\nrunning things instead of making things.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one cares about made things anymore, Les.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's sort of true,\" Lester said. \"I'll allow you that. But it's\r\nonly sort of true. What you're missing is how much people care about\r\norganizations still. That was the really important thing about the New\r\nWork: the way we could all come together to execute, without a lot of\r\ntop-down management. The bangbanger arms dealers, the bio-terrorists\r\nand fatkins suppliers -- they all run on social institutions that we\r\nperfected back then. You've got something like that here with your\r\nmarket, a fluid social institution that you couldn't have had ten or\r\nfifteen years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you say so,\" Perry said. The M&Ms were giving him heartburn. Cheap\r\nchocolate didn't really agree with his stomach.\r\n\r\n\"I do. And so the answer is staring you right in the face: go invent\r\nsome social institutions. You've got one creeping up here in the\r\nride. There are little blogospheres of fans who coordinate what\r\nthey're going to bring down and where they're going to put it. Build\r\non that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one's going to haul ass across the country to ride this ride,\r\nLes. Get real.\"\r\n\r\n\"Course not.\" Lester beamed at him. \"I've got one word for you, man:\r\nfranchise!\"\r\n\r\n\"Franchise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Build dupes of this thing. Print out anything that's a one of a kind,\r\nrun them as franchises.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't work,\" Perry said. \"Like you said, this thing works because of\r\nthe hardcore of volunteer curators who add their own stuff to it --\r\nit's always different. Those franchises would all be static, or would\r\ndiverge... It'd just be boring compared to this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should they diverge? Why should they be static? You could network\r\nthem, dude! What happens in one, happens in all. The curators wouldn't\r\njust be updating one exhibit, but all of them. Thousands of\r\nthem. Millions of them. A gigantic physical wiki. Oh, it'd be so very\r\nvery very cool, Perry. A cool *social institution.*\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm gonna. But I need someone to run the project. Someone who's good\r\nat getting people all pointed in the same direction. You, pal. You're\r\nmy hero on this stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're such a flatterer.\"\r\n\r\n\"You love it, baby,\" Lester said, and fluttered his long\r\neyelashes. \"Like the lady said to the stamp collector, philately will\r\nget you everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oy,\" Perry said. \"You're fired.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't fire me, I'm a volunteer!\"\r\n\r\nLester dropped six golf-balls and a heavy medicine ball down the\r\nhopper. The machine ground and chattered, then started dropping\r\nhundred-loads of M&Ms -- 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 -- then\r\nsome change.\r\n\r\n\"What operation was that?\" Perry said. He'd never seen Lester pull out\r\nthe medicine ball.\r\n\r\n\"Figure it out,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\nPerry thought for a moment. Six squared? Six cubed? Log six? \"Six\r\n*factorial*? My God you're weird, Les.\"\r\n\r\n\"Genius is never appreciated.\" He scooped up a double-handful of brown\r\nM&Ms. \"In your face, Von Neumann! Let's see your precious ENIAC top\r\n*this*!\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nA month later, Perry was clearing security at Miami International,\r\nlooking awkward in long trousers, closed-sole shoes, and a denim\r\njacket. It was autumn in Boston, and he couldn't show up in flip-flops\r\nand a pair of cutoffs. The security guards gave his leathery, lopsided\r\nface a hard look. He grinned like a pirate and made his funny eyebrow\r\ntwitch, a stunt that earned him half an hour behind the screen and a\r\ndate with Doctor Jellyfinger.\r\n\r\n\"What, exactly, do you think I've got hidden up there?\" he asked as he\r\ngripped the railing and tried not to let the illegitimati carborundum.\r\n\r\n\"It's procedure, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the doc said my prostate was the size of a guava about a month\r\nago -- in your professional opinion, has it shrunk or grown? I mean,\r\nwhile you're up there.\"\r\n\r\nThe TSA man didn't like that at all. A minute later, Perry was\r\nbuckling up and leaving the little room with an exaggerated bowlegged\r\ngait. He tipped an imaginary hat at the guard's retreating back and\r\nsaid, \"Call me!\" in a stagey voice.\r\n\r\nIt was the last bit of fun he had for the next four hours, crammed in\r\nthe tin can full of recycled discount air-traveller flatulence and the\r\nclatter of fingers on keyboards and the gabble of a hundred phone\r\nconversations as the salarymen on the flight stole a few minutes of\r\ncramped productivity from the dead travel time.\r\n\r\nTouching down in Boston and getting his luggage, he felt like he'd\r\nlanded on an alien planet. The feeling of disorientation and\r\nforeignness was new to Perry. He was used to being supremely\r\ncomfortable, in control -- confident. But he was nervous now, maybe\r\neven scared, a little.\r\n\r\nHe dialed Tjan. \"I've got my bags,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be right around,\" Tjan said. \"Really looking forward to seeing\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThere were more cops than passengers in the arrivals area at Logan,\r\nand they watched Tjan warily as he pulled up and swung open a door of\r\nhis little sports-car.\r\n\r\n\"What the fuck is this, a Porsche?\" Perry said as he folded himself\r\nawkwardly into the front seat, stepping in through the sun-roof,\r\npulling his bag down into his lap after him.\r\n\r\n\"It's a Lada. I had it imported -- they're all over\r\nRussia. Evolutionary algorithm used to produce a\r\nminimum-materials/maximum-strength chassis. It's nice to see you,\r\nPerry.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's nice to see you, Tjan,\" he said. The car was so low to the\r\nground that it felt like he was riding luge. Tjan hammered mercilessly\r\non the gearbox, rocketing them to Cambridge at such speed that Perry\r\nbarely had time to admire the foliage, except at stop-lights.\r\n\r\nThey were around the campus now, taking a screeching right off Mass\r\nAve onto a tree-lined street of homely two-storey brick houses. Tjan\r\npulled up in front of one and popped the sun-roof. The cold air that\r\nrushed in was as crisp as an apple, unlike any breath of air to be had\r\nin Florida, where there was always a mushiness, a feeling of air that\r\nhad been filtered through the moist lungs of Florida's teeming fauna.\r\n\r\nPerry climbed out of the little Russian sports-car and twisted his\r\nback and raised his arms over his head until his spine gave and popped\r\nand crackled.\r\n\r\nTjan followed, and then he shut down the car with a remote that made\r\nit go through an impressive and stylish series of clicks, clunks and\r\nchirps before settling down over its wheels, dropping the chassis to a\r\nmuffler-scraping centimeter off the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" he said. \"I'll show you your room.\"\r\n\r\nTjan's porch sagged, with a couple kids' bikes triple-locked to it and\r\nan all-covering chalk mosaic over every inch of it. The wood creaked\r\nand gave beneath their feet.\r\n\r\nThe door sprang open and revealed a pretty little girl, nine or ten\r\nyears old, in blue-jeans and a hoodie sweater that went nearly to her\r\nankles, the long sleeves bunched up like beach-balls on her\r\nforearms. The hood hung down to her butt -- it was East Coast\r\nbangbanger, as reinterpreted through the malls.\r\n\r\n\"Daddy!\" she said, and put her arms around Tjan's waist, squeezing\r\nhard.\r\n\r\nHe pried her loose and then hoisted her by the armpits up to\r\neye-height. \"What have you done to your brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing he didn't deserve,\" she said, with a smile that showed\r\ndimples and made her little nose wrinkle.\r\n\r\nTjan looked over at Perry. \"This is my daughter, Lyenitchka, who is\r\nabout to be locked in the coal cellar until she learns to stop\r\ntorturing her younger brother. Lyenitchka, this is Perry Gibbons, upon\r\nwhom you have already made an irreparably bad first impression.\" He\r\nshook her gently Perrywards.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Perry,\" she said, giggling, holding out one hand. She had a\r\nfaint accent, which made her sound like a tiny, skinny Bond\r\nvillainess.\r\n\r\nHe shook gravely. \"Nice to meet you,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You got your kids,\" Perry said, once she was gone.\r\n\r\n\"For the school year. Me and the ex, we had a heart-to-heart about the\r\nRussian education system and ended up here: I get the kids from\r\nSeptember to June, but not Christmases or Easter holidays. She gets\r\nthem the rest of the time, and takes them to a family dacha in\r\nUkraine, where she assures me there are hardly any mafiyeh kids to\r\ninfluence my darling daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be loving this,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\nTjan's face went serious. \"This is the best thing that's ever happened\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm really happy for you, buddy.\"\r\n\r\nThey had burgers in the back-yard, cooking on an electric grill that\r\nwas caked with the smoking grease of a summer's worth of outdoor\r\nmeals. The plastic table-cloth was weighed down with painted rocks and\r\nthe corners blew up in the freshening autumn winds. Lyenitchka's\r\nlittle brother appeared when the burgers began to spit and smoke on\r\nthe grill, a seven-year-old in metallic mesh trousers and shirt\r\nwrought with the logo of a cartoon Cossack holding a laser-sword\r\naloft.\r\n\r\n\"Sasha, meet Perry.\" Sasha looked away, then went off to swing on a\r\ntire-swing hanging from the big tree.\r\n\r\n\"You've got good kids,\" Perry said, handing Tjan a beer from the\r\ncooler under the picnic table.\r\n\r\n\"Yup,\" Tjan said. He flipped the burgers and then looked at both of\r\nthem. Lyenitchka was pushing her brother on the swing, a little too\r\nhard. Tjan smiled and looked back down at his burgers.\r\n\r\nTjan cut the burgers in half and dressed them to his kids' exacting\r\nstandards. They picked at them, pushed them onto each other's plates\r\nand got some into their mouths.\r\n\r\n\"I've read your briefing on the ride,\" Tjan said, once his kids had\r\nfinished and eaten half a package of Chutney Oreos for dessert. \"It's\r\npretty weird stuff.\"\r\n\r\nPerry nodded and cracked another beer. The cool air was weirding him\r\nout, awakening some atavistic instinct to seek a cave. \"Yup, weird as\r\nhell. But they love it. Not just the geeks, either, though they eat it\r\nup, you should see it. Obsessive doesn't begin to cover it. But the\r\ncivilians come by the hundreds, too. You should hear them when they\r\ncome out: 'Jee-zus, I'd forgotten about those dishwasher-stackers,\r\nthey were wicked! Where can I get one of those these days you figger?'\r\nThe nostalgia's thick enough to cut with a knife.\"\r\n\r\nTjan nodded. \"I've been going over your books, but I can't figure out\r\nif you're profitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, that's me. I'm pretty good at keeping track of numbers, but\r\ngetting them massaged into a coherent picture --\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I know.\" Tjan got a far-away look. \"How'd you make out on\r\nKodacell, Perry? Finance-wise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough to open the ride, buy a car. Didn't lose anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah.\" Tjan fiddled with his beer. \"Listen, I got rich off of\r\nWestinghouse. Not fuck-the-service-here-I'm-buying-this-restaurant\r\nrich, but rich enough that I never have to work again. I can spend the\r\nrest of my life in this yard, flipping burgers, taking care of my\r\nkids, and looking at porn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you were the suit. Getting rich is what suits do. I'm just a\r\ngrunt.\"\"\r\n\r\nTjan had the good grace to look slightly embarrassed. \"Now here's the\r\nthing. I don't *have* to work, but, Perry, I have *no idea* what I'm\r\ngoing to do if I don't work. The kids are at school all day. Do you\r\nhave any idea how much daytime TV sucks? Playing the stock market is\r\ncompletely nuts, it's all gone sideways and upside down. I got an\r\neducation so I wouldn't *have* to flip burgers for the rest of my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you saying, Tjan?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm saying yes,\" Tjan said, grinning piratically. \"I'm saying that\r\nI'll join your little weird-ass hobby business and I'll open another\r\nride here for the Massholes. I'll help you run the franchising op,\r\ncollect fees, make it profitable.\"\r\n\r\nPerry felt his face tighten.\r\n\r\n\"What? I thought you'd be happy about this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" Perry said. \"But you're misunderstanding something. These\r\naren't meant to be profitable businesses. I'm done with that. These\r\nare art, or community, or something. They're museums. Lester calls\r\nthem *wunderkammers* -- cabinets of wonders. There's no franchising op\r\nthe way you're talking about it. It's ad hoc. It's a protocol we all\r\nagree on, not a business arrangement.\"\r\n\r\nTjan grunted. \"I don't think I understand the difference between a\r\nagreed-upon protocol and a business arrangement.\" He held up his hand\r\nto fend off Perry's next remark. \"But it doesn't matter. You can let\r\npeople have the franchise for free. You can claim that you're not\r\nletting anyone have anything, that they're letting themselves in for\r\ntheir franchise. It doesn't matter to me.\r\n\r\n\"But Perry, here's something you're going to have to understand: it's\r\ngoing to be nearly impossible *not to* make a business out of\r\nthis. Businesses are great structures for managing big projects. It's\r\nlike trying to develop the ability to walk without developing a\r\nskeleton. Once in a blue moon, you get an octopus, but for the most\r\npart, you get skeletons. Skeletons are good shit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tjan, I want you to come on board to help me create an octopus,\"\r\nPerry said.\r\n\r\n\"I can try,\" Tjan said, \"but it won't be easy. When you do cool stuff,\r\nyou end up making money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine,\" Perry said. \"Make money. But keep it to a minimum, OK?\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe next time Perry turned up at Logan, it was colder than the inside\r\nof an icebox and shitting down grey snow with the consistency of\r\nfrozen custard.\r\n\r\n\"Great weather for an opening,\" he said, once he'd climbed through the\r\nroof of Tjan's car and gotten snow all over the leather\r\nupholstery. \"Sorry about the car.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't sweat it, the kids are murder on leather. I should trade this\r\nthing in on something that's less of a deathtrap anyway.\"\r\n\r\nTjan was balder than he'd been in September, and skinnier. He had a\r\nthree-day beard that further hollowed out his normally round\r\ncheeks. The Lada sports-car fishtailed a little as they navigated the\r\ntunnels back toward Cambridge, the roads slick and icy.\r\n\r\n\"We scored an excellent location,\" Tjan said. \"I told you that, but\r\ncheck this out.\" They were right in the middle of a built-up area of\r\nBoston, something that felt like a banking district, with impressive\r\ntowers. It took Perry a minute to figure out what Tjan was pointing\r\nat.\r\n\r\n\"That's the site?\" There was a mall on the corner, with a boarded up\r\nderelict Hyatt overtopping it, rising high into the sky. \"But it's\r\nright in the middle of town!\"\r\n\r\n\"Boston's not Florida,\" Tjan said. \"Lots of people here don't have\r\ncars. There were some dead malls out in Worcester and the like, but I\r\ngot this place for nothing. The owners haven't paid taxes in the ten\r\nyears since the hotel folded, and the only shops that were left open\r\nwere a couple of Azerbaijani import-export guys, selling junky stuff\r\nfrom India.\r\n\r\n\"We gutted the whole second floor and turned the ground-floor\r\nfood-court into a flea-market. There's an old tunnel connecting this\r\nto the T and I managed to get it re-opened, so I expect we'll get some\r\nwalk-in.\"\r\n\r\nPerry marveled. Tjan had a suit's knack for pulling off the\r\nambitious. Perry had never tried to even rent an apartment in a big\r\ncity, figuring that any place where land was at a premium was a place\r\nwhere people willing to spend more than him could be found. Give him a\r\nghost-mall that was off the GPS grid anytime.\r\n\r\n\"Have you managed to fill the flea market?\" It had taken Perry a long\r\ntime to fill his, and still he had a couple of dogs -- a tarot reader\r\nand a bong stall, a guy selling high-pressure spray-paint cans and a\r\ndiscount porn stall that sold naked shovelware by the petabyte.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I got proteges up and down New England. A lot of them settled\r\nhere after the crash. One place is as good as another, and the housing\r\nwas wicked-cheap once the economy disappeared. They upped stakes and\r\ncame to Boston as soon as I put the word out. I think everyone's\r\nwaiting for the next big thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perry, New Work is the most important thing that ever happened to\r\nsome of those people. It was the high-point of their lives. It was the\r\nonly time they ever felt useful.\"\r\n\r\nPerry shook his head. \"Don't you think that's sad?\"\r\n\r\nTjan negotiated a tricky tunnel interchange and got the car pointed to\r\nCambridge. \"No, Perry, I don't think it's sad. Jesus Christ, you can't\r\nbelieve that. Why do you think I'm helping you? You and me and all the\r\nrest of them, we did something *important*. The world changed. It's\r\ncontinuing to change. Have you stopped to think that one in five\r\nAmerican workers picked up and moved somewhere else to do New Work\r\nprojects? That's one of the largest American resettlements since the\r\ndustbowl. The average New Work collective shipped more inventions per\r\nyear than Edison Labs at its peak. In a hundred years, when they\r\nremember the centuries that were America's, they'll count this one\r\namong them, because of what we made.\r\n\r\n\"So no, Perry, I don't think it's sad.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry. Sorry, OK? I didn't mean it that way. But it's tragic,\r\nisn't it, that the dream ended? That they're all living out there in\r\nthe boonies, thinking of their glory days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that *is* sad. But that's why I agreed to do the ride -- not to\r\nfreeze the old projects in amber, but to create a new project that we\r\ncan all participate in again. These people uprooted their lives to\r\nfollow us, it's the least we can do to give them something back for\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nPerry stewed on that the rest of the way to Tjan's, staring at the\r\nsleet, hand resting against the icy window-glass.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSammy checked in to a Comfort Inn tucked into the thirty-seventh\r\nstorey of the Bank of America building in downtown Boston. The lobby\r\nwas empty, the security-guard's desk unmanned. B of A was in\r\nreceivership, and not doing so hot at that, as the fact that they had\r\nlet out their executive floors to a discount business-hotel testified.\r\n\r\nThe room was fine, though -- small and windowless, but fine: power,\r\nshower, toilet and bed, all he demanded in a hotel room. He ate the\r\npacket of nuts he'd bought at the airport before jumping on the T and\r\nthen checked his email. He had more of it than he could possibly\r\nanswer -- he didn't think he'd ever had an empty in-box.\r\n\r\nBut he picked off anything that looked important, including a note\r\nfrom his ex-, who was now living in the Keys on a squatter beach and\r\nwanted to know if he could loan her a hundred bucks. No sense of how\r\nshe'd pay him back without work. But Michelle was resourceful and\r\nprobably good for it. He paypalled it to her, feeling like a sucker\r\nfor hoping that she might repay it in person. He'd been single since\r\nshe'd left him the year before and he was lonely and hard-up.\r\n\r\nHe'd landed at two and by the time he was done with all the bullshit,\r\nit was after dinner time and he was hungry as hell. Boston was full of\r\ntaco-wagons and kebab stands that he'd passed on the walk in, and he\r\nhustled out onto the street to see if any were still open. He got a\r\nhuge garlicky kebab and ate it in the lee of a frozen ATM shelter,\r\nwolfing it without tasting it.\r\n\r\nHe went and scouted the location of the new ride. He'd gotten wind of\r\nit online -- none of his idiot colleagues could be bothered to read\r\nthe public email lists of the competitors they were supposedly in\r\ncharge of oppo researching. Shaking loose the budget to get a discount\r\nflight to Boston had been a major coup, requiring horse-trading,\r\nblackmail, and passive-aggressive gaming of the system. With the\r\nridiculously low per-diem and hotel allowance he'd still go home a\r\ncouple hundred bucks out-of-pocket. Why did he even do his job? He\r\nshould just play by the rules and get nothing done.\r\n\r\nAnd get fired. Or passed up for promotion, which was practically the\r\nsame thing.\r\n\r\nThe new ride was in an impressive urban mall. He'd spent his college\r\nyears in Philly and had passed many a happy day in malls like this\r\none, cruising for girls or camping out on a bench with his books and a\r\nsmoothie. Unlike the crappy roadside malls of Florida, there had been\r\nnothing but the best stores in them, the property values too high to\r\nmake anything but high-margin, high-turnover, high-ticket shops\r\nviable.\r\n\r\nSo it was especially sad to see this mall turned over to the junky\r\nstalls and junkier ride -- like a fat, washed-up supermodel sentenced\r\nto a talk-show appearance for her shoplifting arrests. He approached\r\nthe doors with trepidation. He was resolved not to buy anything from\r\nthe market -- no busts or contact lenses -- and had stuck his wallet\r\nin his front pocket on the way over.\r\n\r\nThe mall was like a sauna. He shucked his jacket and sweater and hung\r\nthem over one arm. The whole ground floor had been given over to\r\nflimsy market-stalls. He skulked among them, trying to simultaneously\r\ntake note of their contents and avoid their owners' notice.\r\n\r\nHe came to realize that he needn't skulk. It seemed like half of\r\nBoston had turned out -- not just young people, either. There were\r\nplenty of tweedy academics, big working-class Southie boys with thick\r\naccents, recent immigrants with Scandie-chic clothes. They chattered\r\nand laughed and mixed freely and ate hot food out of huge cauldrons or\r\noff of clever electric grills. The smells made his stomach growl, even\r\nthough he'd just polished off a kebab the size of his head.\r\n\r\nThe buzz of the crowd reminded him of something, what was it? A\r\npremiere, that was it. When they opened a new ride or area at the\r\nPark, there was the same sense of thrilling anticipation, of\r\nexcitement and eagerness. That made it worse -- these people had no\r\nbusiness being this excited about something so. . . lowbrow? Cheap?\r\nWhatever it was, it wasn't worthy.\r\n\r\nThey were shopping like fiends. A mother with a baby on her hip pushed\r\npast him, her stroller piled high with shopping bags screened with\r\ngiant, pixellated Belgian pastries. She was laughing and the baby on\r\nher hip was laughing too.\r\n\r\nHe headed for the escalator, whose treads had been anodized in bright\r\ncolors, something he'd never seen before. He let it carry him\r\nupstairs, but looked down, and so he was nearly at the top before he\r\nrealized that the guy from the Florida ride was standing there,\r\nhanding out fliers and staring at Sammy like he knew him from\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\nIt was too late to avoid him. Sammy put on his best castmember\r\nsmile. \"Hello there!\"\r\n\r\nThe guy grinned and wiggled his eyebrow. \"I know you from somewhere,\"\r\nhe said slowly.\r\n\r\n\"From Florida,\" Sammy said, with an apologetic shrug. \"I came up to\r\nsee the opening.\"\r\n\r\n\"No *way*!\" The guy had a huge smile now, looked like was going to hug\r\nhim. \"You're shitting me!\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I say? I'm a fan.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's *incredible.* Hey, Tjan, come here and meet this guy. What's\r\nyour name?\"\r\n\r\nSammy tried to think of another name, but drew a blank. \"Mickey,\" he\r\nsaid at last, kicking himself.\r\n\r\n\"Tjan, this is Mickey. He's a regular on the ride in Florida and he's\r\ncome up here just to see the opening.\"\r\n\r\nTjan had short hair and sallow skin, and dressed like an accountant,\r\nbut his eyes were bright and sharp as they took Sammy in, looking him\r\nup and down quickly. \"Well that's certainly flattering.\" He reached\r\ninto his creased blazer and pulled out a slip of paper. \"Have a couple\r\ncomp tickets then -- the least we can do for your loyalty.\" The paper\r\nwas festooned with holograms and smart-cards and raised bumps\r\ncontaining RFIDs, but Sammy knew that you could buy standard\r\nanti-counterfeiting stock like it from a mail-order catalog.\r\n\r\n\"That's mighty generous of you,\" he said, shaking Tjan's dry, firm\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"Our pleasure,\" the other guy said. \"Better get in line, though, or\r\nyou're gonna be waiting a long, long time.\" He had a satisfied\r\nexpression. Sammy saw that what he'd mistaken for a crowd of people\r\nwas in fact a long, jostling queue stretching all the way around the\r\nescalator mezzanine and off one of the mall's side corridors.\r\n\r\nFeeling like he'd averted a disaster, Sammy followed the length of the\r\nqueue until he came to its end. He popped in a headphone and set up\r\nhis headline reader to text-to-speech his day's news. He'd fallen\r\nbehind, what with the air travel and all. Most of the stuff in his\r\ncache came in from his co-workers, and it was the most insipid crap\r\nanyway, but he had to listen to it or he'd be odd man out at the\r\nwatercooler when he got back.\r\n\r\nHe listened with half an ear and considered the gigantic crowd\r\nstretching away as far as the eye could see. Compared with the\r\nre-opening of Fantasyland, it was nothing -- goths from all over the\r\nworld had flocked to central Florida for that, Germans and Greeks and\r\nJapanese and even some from Mumbai and Russia. They'd filled the park\r\nto capacity, thrilled with the delightful perversity of chirpy old\r\nDisney World remade as a goth theme park.\r\n\r\nBut a line this long in Boston, in the dead of winter, for something\r\nwhose sole attraction was that there was another one like it by a\r\nshitty forgotten b-road outside of Miami? Christ on an Omnimover.\r\n\r\nThe line moved, just a little surge, and there was a cheer all down\r\nthe mall's length. People poured past him headed for the line's tail,\r\nvibrating with excitement. But the line didn't move again for five\r\nminutes, then ten. Then another surge, but maybe that was just people\r\ncrowding together more. Some of the people in line were drinking beers\r\nout of paper bags and getting raucous.\r\n\r\n\"What's going on?\" someone hollered from behind him. The cry was taken\r\nup, and then the line shuddered and moved forward some. Then nothing.\r\n\r\nThinking, *screw this*, Sammy got out of line and walked to the\r\nfront. Tjan was there, working the velvet rope, letting people through\r\nin dribs and drabs. He caught sight of Sammy and gave him a solemn\r\nnod. \"They're all taking too long to ride,\" he said. \"I tell them\r\nfifteen minutes max, get back in line if you want to see more, but\r\nwhat can you do?\"\r\n\r\nSammy nodded sympathetically. The guy with the funny eyebrow put in an\r\nappearance from behind the heavy black curtains. \"Send through two\r\nmore,\" he said, and grabbed Sammy, tugging him in.\r\n\r\nBehind the curtain, it was dim and spotlit, almost identical to\r\nFlorida, and half a dozen vehicles waited. Sammy slid into one and let\r\nthe spiel wash over him.\r\n\r\nTHERE WAS A TIME WHEN AMERICA HELD OUT THE PROMISE OF A NEW WAY OF\r\nLIVING AND WORKING. THE NEW WORK BOOM OF THE TEENS WAS A PERIOD OF\r\nUNPARALLELED INVENTION, A CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION OF CREATIVITY NOT SEEN\r\nSINCE THE TIME OF EDISON -- AND UNLIKE EDISON, THE PEOPLE WHO INVENTED\r\nTHE NEW WORK REVOLUTION WEREN'T RIP-OFF ARTISTS AND FRAUDS.\r\n\r\nThe layout was slightly different due to the support pillars, but as\r\nsimilar to the Florida version as geography allowed. Robots humped\r\nunderfoot moving objects, keeping them in sync with the changes in\r\nFlorida. He'd read on the message boards that Florida would stay open\r\nlate so that the riders could collaborate with the attendees at the\r\nBoston premiere, tweeting back and forth to one another.\r\n\r\nThe other chairs in the ride crawled around each exhibit, reversing\r\nand turning slowly. Riders brought their chairs up alongside one\r\nanother and conferred in low voices, over the narration from the\r\nscenery. He thought he saw a couple making out -- a common enough\r\noccurrence in dark rides that he'd even exploited a few times when\r\nplanning out rides that would be likely to attract amorous\r\nteenagers. They had a key demographic: too young to leave home, old\r\nenough to pay practically anything for a private spot to score some\r\nnookie.\r\n\r\nThe air smelled of three-d printer, the cheap smell of truck-stops\r\nwhere vending machines outputted cheap kids' toys. Here it wasn't\r\ncheap, though: here it smelled futuristic, like the first time someone\r\nhad handed him a printed prop for one of his rides -- it had been a\r\nhead for an updated Small World ride. Then it had smelled like\r\nsomething foreign and new and exciting and frightening, like the first\r\ndays of a different world.\r\n\r\nSmelling that again, remembering the crowds outside waiting to get in,\r\nSammy started to get a sick feeling, the kebab rebounding on\r\nhim. Moving as if in a dream, he reached down into his lap and drew\r\nout a small utility knife. There would be infrared cameras, but he\r\nknew from experience that they couldn't see through ride vehicles.\r\n\r\nSlowly, he fingered the access panel's underside until he found a\r\nloose corner. He snicked out the knife's little blade -- he'd brought\r\nan entire suitcase just so he could have a checked bag to store this\r\nin -- and tugged at the cables inside. He sawed at them with small\r\nmovements, feeling the copper wires inside the insulation give way one\r\nstrand at a time. The chair moved jerkily, then not at all. He snipped\r\na few more wires just to be sure, then tucked them all away.\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" he called. \"My chair's dead!\" He had fetched up in a central\r\npathway where the chairs tried to run cloverleafs around four\r\ndisplays. A couple chairs swerved around him. He thumped the panel\r\ndramatically, then stepped out and shook his head. He contrived to\r\nstep on three robots on the way to another chair.\r\n\r\n\"Is yours working?\" he asked the kid riding in it, all of ten years\r\nold and of indefinite gender.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" the kid said. It scooted over. \"There's room for both of us,\r\nget in.\"\r\n\r\n*Christ, don't they have stranger-danger in the north?* He climbed in\r\n beside the kid and contrived to slide one sly hand under the\r\n panel. Teasing out the wires the second time was easier, even\r\n one-handed. He sliced through five large bundles this time before the\r\n chair ground to a halt, its gyros whining and rocking it from\r\n side-to-side.\r\n\r\nThe kid looked at him and frowned. \"These things are shit,\" it said\r\nwith real vehemence, climbing down and kicking one of its tires, and\r\nthen kicking a couple of the floor-level robots for good\r\nmeasure. They'd landed another great breakdown spot: directly in front\r\nof a ranked display of raygun-shaped appliances and objects. He\r\nremembered seeing that one in its nascent stage, back in Florida --\r\njust a couple of toy guns, which were presently joined by three more,\r\nthen there were ten, then fifty, then a high wall of them, striking\r\nand charming. The chair's breakdown position neatly blocked the way.\r\n\r\n\"Guess we'd better walk out,\" he said. He stepped on a couple more\r\nrobots, making oops noises. The kid enthusiastically kicked robots out\r\nof its way. Chairs swerved around them as other riders tried to\r\nnavigate. They were approaching the exit when Sammy spotted a\r\ncharge-plate for the robots. They were standard issue for robotic\r\nvacuum cleaners and other semi-autonomous appliances, and he'd had one\r\nin his old apartment. They were supposed to be safe as anything, but a\r\nfriend's toddler had crawled over to his and shoved a stack of dimes\r\ninto its recessed jack and one of them had shorted it out in a\r\nsmoking, fizzing fireworks display.\r\n\r\n\"You go on ahead, I'm going to tie my shoes.\"\r\n\r\nSammy bent down beside the charge plate, his back to the kid and the\r\nimagined cameras that were capturing his every move, and slipped the\r\nstack of coins he'd taken from his pocket into the little slot where\r\nthe robots inserted their charging stamen.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing shower of sparks was more dramatic than he'd remembered --\r\nmaybe it was the darkened room. The kid shrieked and ran for the EXIT\r\nsign, and he took off too, at a good clip. They'd get the ride up and\r\nrunning soon enough, but maybe not tonight, not if they couldn't get\r\nthe two chairs he'd toasted out of the room.\r\n\r\nThere was the beginnings of chaos at the exit. There was that Tjan\r\ncharacter, giving him an intense look. He tried to head for the down\r\nescalator, but Tjan cut him off.\r\n\r\n\"What's going on in there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Damnedest thing,\" he said, trying to keep his face composed. \"My\r\nchair died. Then another one -- a little kid was riding in it. Then\r\nthere was a lot of electrical sparks, and I walked out. Crazy.\"\r\n\r\nTjan cocked his head. \"I hope you're not hurt. We could have a doctor\r\nlook at you; there are a couple around tonight.\"\r\n\r\nIt had never occurred to Sammy that professional types might turn out\r\nfor a ride like this, but of course it was obvious. There were\r\nprobably off-duty cops, local politicians, lawyers, and the like.\r\n\r\n\"I'm fine,\" he said. \"Don't worry about me. Maybe you should send\r\nsomeone in for the people still in there, though?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's being taken care of. I'm just sorry you came all the way from\r\nFlorida for this kind of disappointment. That's just brutal.\" Tjan's\r\nmeasuring stare was even more intense.\r\n\r\n\"Uh, it's OK. I had meetings here this week. This was just a cool\r\nbonus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who do you work for, Mickey?\"\r\n\r\nShit.\r\n\r\n\"Insurance company,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"That'd be Norwich Union, then, right? They've got a headquarters\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nSammy knew how this went. Norwich Union didn't have headquarters\r\nhere. Or they did. He'd have to outguess Tjan with his answer.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to stay open tonight?\"\r\n\r\nTjan nodded, though it wasn't clear whether he was nodding because he\r\nwas answering in the affirmative or because his suspicions had been\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\n\"Well then, I should be going.\"\r\n\r\nTjan put out a hand. \"Oh, please stay. I'm sure we'll be running soon;\r\nyou should get a whole ride through.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, really, I have to go.\" He shook off the hand and pelted down the\r\nescalator and out into the freezing night. His blood sang in his\r\nears. They probably wouldn't get the ride running that night at\r\nall. They probably would send that whole carnival crowd home,\r\ndisappointed. He'd won some kind of little victory over something.\r\n\r\nHe'd felt more confident of his victory when he was concerned with the\r\nguy with the funny eyebrow -- with Perry. He'd seemed little more than\r\na bum, a vag. But this Tjan reminded him of the climbers he'd met\r\nthrough his career at Walt Disney World: keenly observant and fast\r\nformulators of strategies. Someone who could add two and two before\r\nyou'd know that there was such a thing as four.\r\n\r\nSammy walked back to his hotel as quickly as he could, given the icy\r\nsidewalks underfoot, and by the time he got to the lobby of the old\r\noffice tower his face hurt -- forehead, cheeks and nose. He'd booked\r\nhis return flight for a day later, thinking he'd do more reccies of\r\nthe new site before writing his report and heading home, but there was\r\nno way he was facing down that Tjan guy again.\r\n\r\nWhat had prompted him to sabotage the ride? It was something primal,\r\nsomething he hadn't been in any real control of. He'd been in some\r\nkind of fugue-state. But he'd packed the little knife in his suitcase\r\nand he'd slipped it into his pocket before leaving the room. So how\r\ninstinctive could it possibly have been?\r\n\r\nHe had a vision of the carnival atmosphere in the market stalls\r\noutside and knew that even after the ride had broken down, the crowd\r\nhad lingered, laughing and browsing and enjoying a night's respite\r\nfrom the world and the cold city. The Whos down in Who-ville had gone\r\non singing even after he'd Grinched their ride.\r\n\r\nThat was it. The ride didn't just make use of user-created content --\r\nit *was* user-created content. He could never convince his bosses in\r\nOrlando to let him build anything remotely like this, and given enough\r\ntime, it would surely overtake them. That Tjan -- someone like him\r\nwouldn't be involved if there wasn't some serious money opportunity on\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\nHe'd seen the future that night and he had no place in it.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nIt only took a week on the Boston ride before they had their third and\r\nfourth nodes. The third was outside of San Francisco, in a gigantic\r\nghost-mall that was already being used as a flea-market. They had two\r\nformer anchor-stores, one of which was being squatted by artists who\r\nneeded studio space. The other one made a perfect location for a new\r\nride, and the geeks who planned on building it had cut their teeth\r\nbuilding elaborate Burning Man confectioneries together, so Perry gave\r\nthem his blessing.\r\n\r\nThe fourth was to open in Raleigh, in the Research Triangle, where the\r\nstrip malls ran one into the next. The soft-spoken, bitingly ironic\r\nsoutherners who proposed it were the daughters of old IBM blue-tie\r\nstalwarts who'd been running a women's tech collective since they\r\nrealized they couldn't afford college and dropped out together. They\r\nwanted to see how much admission they could charge if they let it be\r\nknown that they would plow their profits into scholarship funds for\r\nlocal women.\r\n\r\nPerry couldn't believe that these people wanted to open their own\r\nrides, nor that they thought they needed his permission to do so. He\r\nwas reminded of the glory days of New Work, when every day there were\r\nfifty New Work sites with a hundred new gizmos, popping up on the\r\nmailing lists, looking for distributors, recruiting, competing,\r\nswarming, arguing, forming and reforming. Watching Tjan cut the deals\r\nwhereby these people were granted permission to open their own\r\neditions of the ride felt like that, and weirder still.\r\n\r\n\"Why do they need our permission? The API's wide open. They can just\r\nimplement. Are they sheep or something?\"\r\n\r\nTjan gave him an old-fashioned look. \"They're being polite, Perry --\r\nthey're giving you face for being the progenitor of the ride.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like it,\" Perry said. \"I didn't get anyone's permission to\r\ninclude their junk in the ride. When we get a printer to clone\r\nsomething that someone brings here, we don't get their permission. Why\r\nthe hell is seeking permission considered so polite? Shit, why not\r\nsend me a letter asking me if I mind receiving an email? Where does it\r\nend?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're trying to be nice to you Perry, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well I don't like it,\" Perry said. \"How about this: from now on when\r\nsomeone asks for permission we tell them no, we don't give out *or*\r\nwithhold permission for joining the network, but we hope that they'll\r\njoin it anyway. Maybe put up a FAQ on the site.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll just confuse people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't be confusing them, man! I'll be educating them!\"\r\n\r\n\"How about if you add a Creative Commons license to it? Some of them\r\nare very liberal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't *want* to license this. You have to *own* something to\r\nlicense it. A license is a way of saying, 'Without this license,\r\nyou're forbidden to do this.' You don't need a license to click a link\r\nand load a webpage -- no one has to give you permission to do this and\r\nno one could take it away from you. Licensing just gives people even\r\nworse ideas about ownership and permission and property!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's your show,\" Tjan said.\r\n\r\n\"No it *isn't*! That's the *point*!\"\r\n\r\n\"OK, OK, it's not your show. But we'll do it your way. You are a\r\nlovable, cranky weirdo, you know it?\"\r\n\r\nThey did it Perry's way. He was scheduled to go back to Florida a few\r\ndays later, but he changed his ticket to go out to San Francisco and\r\nmeet with the crew who were implementing the ride there. One of them\r\ntaught interaction design at SFSU and brought him in to talk to the\r\nstudents. He wasn't sure what he was going to talk to them about, but\r\nwhen he got there, he found himself telling the story of how he and\r\nLester and Tjan and Suzanne and Kettlebelly had built and lost the New\r\nWork movement, without even trying. It was a fun story to tell from\r\nstart to finish, and they talked through the lunch break and then a\r\ngroup of students took him to a bar in the Mission with a big outdoor\r\npatio where he went on telling war stories until the sun had set and\r\nhe'd drunk so much beer he couldn't tell stories any longer.\r\n\r\nThey were all ten or fifteen years younger than him, and the girls\r\nwere pretty and androgynous and the boys were also pretty and\r\nandrogynous, not that he really swung that way. Still, it was fine\r\nbeing surrounded by the catcalling, joking, bullshitting crowd of\r\nyoung, pretty, flirty people. They hugged him a lot, and two of the\r\nprettier girls (who, he later realized, were a lot more interested in\r\neach other than him) took him back to a capsule hotel built across\r\nthree parking-spots and poured him into bed and tucked him in.\r\n\r\nHe had a burrito the size of a football for breakfast, stuffed with\r\nshredded pig-parts and two kinds of sloppy beans. He washed it down\r\nwith a quart of a cinnamon/rice drink called horchata that was served\r\nice-cold and did wonders for his hangover.\r\n\r\nA couple hours' noodling on his laptop and a couple bags of Tecate\r\nlater and he was feeling almost human. Early mariachis strolled the\r\nstreet with electric guitars that controlled little tribes of dancing,\r\nsinging knee-high animatronics, belting out old Jose Alfredo Jimenez\r\ntunes.\r\n\r\nIt was shaping up to be a good day. His laptop rang and he screwed in\r\nhis headset and started talking to Tjan.\r\n\r\n\"Man, this place is excellent,\" he said. \"I had the best night I've\r\nhad in years last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then you'll love this: there's a crew in Madison that want to do\r\nthe same thing and could use a little guidance. They spoke to me this\r\nmorning and said they'd be happy to spring for the airfare. Can you\r\nmake a six o'clock flight at SFO?\"\r\n\r\nThey gave him cheese in Madison and introduced him to the biohackers\r\nwho were the spiritual progeny of the quirky moment when Madison was\r\none of six places where stem cells could be legally researched. The\r\nbiohackers gave him the willies. One had gills. One glowed in the\r\ndark. One was orange and claimed to photosynthesize.\r\n\r\nHe got his hosts to bring him to the ratskeller where they sat down to\r\ncomedy-sized beers and huge, suspicious steaming wursts.\r\n\r\n\"Where's your site?\"\r\n\r\n\"We were thinking of building one -- there's a lot of farmland around\r\nhere.\" Either the speaker was sixteen years old or Perry was getting\r\nto be such a drunken old fart that everyone seemed sixteen. He wasn't\r\nold enough to shave, anyway. Perry tried to remember his name and\r\ncouldn't. Jet-lag or sleepdep or whatever.\r\n\r\n\"That's pretty weird. Everywhere else, they're just moving into spaces\r\nthat have been left vacant.\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't got many of those. All the offices and stuff are being\r\noccupied by heavily funded startups.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavily funded startups? In this day and age?\"\r\n\r\n\"Superbabies,\" the kid said with a shrug. \"It's all anyone here thinks\r\nabout anymore. That and cancer cures. I think superbabies are crazy --\r\nimagine being a twenty-year-old superbaby, with two-decade-old\r\ntechnology in your genes. In your germline! Breeding other obsolete\r\nsuperbabies. Crazy. But the Chinese are investing heavily.\"\r\n\r\n\"So no dead malls? Christ, that's like running out of sand or hydrogen\r\nor something. Are we still in America?\"\r\n\r\nThe kid laughed. \"The campus is building more student housing because\r\nnone of us can afford the rents around here anymore. But there's lots\r\nof farmland, like I said. Won't be a problem to throw up a prefab and\r\nput the ride inside it. It'll be like putting up a haunted cornfield\r\nat Halloween. Used to do that every year to raise money for the ACLU,\r\nback in Nebraska.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wow.\" He wanted to say, *They have the ACLU in Nebraska?* but he knew\r\nthat wasn't fair. The midwesterners he'd met had generally been\r\nkick-ass geeks and hackers, so he had no call to turn his nose up at\r\nthis kid. \"So why do you want to do this?\"\r\n\r\nThe kid grinned. \"Because there's got to be a way to do something cool\r\nwithout moving to New York. I like it around here. Don't want to live\r\nin some run-down defaulted shit-built condo where the mice are\r\nhunchbacked. Like the wide-open spaces. But I don't want to be a\r\nfarmer or an academic or run a student bar. All that stuff is a\r\ndead-end, I can see it from here. I mean, who drinks beer anymore?\r\nThere's much sweeter highs out there in the real world.\"\r\n\r\nPerry looked at his beer. It was in a themed stein with Germano-Gothic\r\ngingerbread worked into the finish. It felt like it had been printed\r\nfrom some kind of ceramic/epoxy hybrid. You could get them at\r\ntraveling carny midways, too.\r\n\r\n\"I like beer,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"But you're --\" The kid broke off.\r\n\r\n\"Old,\" Perry said. \"'Sok. You're what, 16?\"\r\n\r\n\"21,\" the kid said. \"I'm a late bloomer. Devoting resources to more\r\nimportant things than puberty.\"\r\n\r\nTwo more kids slid into their booth, a boy and a girl who actually did\r\nlook 21. \"Hey Luke,\" the girl said, kissing him on the cheek.\r\n\r\nLuke, that was his name. Perry came up with a mnemonic so he wouldn't\r\nforget it again -- Nebraska baby-faced farm boy, that was like Luke\r\nSkywalker. He pictured the kid swinging a lightsaber and knew he'd\r\nkeep the name for good now.\r\n\r\n\"This is Perry Gibbons,\" Luke said. \"Perry, this is Hilda and\r\nErnie. Guys, Perry's the guy who built the ride I was telling you\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\nErnie shook his hand. \"Man, that's the coolest shit I've ever seen,\r\nwow. What the hell are you doing here? I love that stuff. Wow.\"\r\n\r\nHilda flicked his ear. \"Stop drooling, fanboy,\" she said.\r\n\r\nErnie rubbed his ear. Perry nodded uncertainly.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry. It's just -- well, I'm a big fan is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's really nice of you,\" Perry said. He'd met a couple people in\r\nBoston and San Francisco who called themselves his fans, and he hadn't\r\nknown what to say to them, either. Back in the New Work days he'd meet\r\nreporters who called themselves fans, but that was just blowing\r\nsmoke. Now he was meeting people who seemed to really mean it. Not\r\nmany, thank God.\r\n\r\n\"He's just like a puppy,\" Hilda said, pinching Ernie's cheek. \"All\r\nenthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\nErnie rubbed his cheek. Luke reached out abruptly and tousled both of\r\ntheir hair. \"These two are going to help me build the ride,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Hilda's an amazing fundraiser. Last year she ran the\r\nfundraising for a whole walk-in clinic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Women's health clinic or something?\" Perry asked. He was starting to\r\nsober up a little. Hilda was one of those incredible, pneumatic\r\nmidwestern girls that he'd seen at five minute intervals since getting\r\noff his flight in Madison. He didn't think he'd ever met one like her.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Hilda said. \"Metabolic health. Lots of people get the fatkins\r\ntreatment at puberty, either because their fatkins parents talk them\r\ninto it or because they hate their baby fat.\"\r\n\r\nPerry shook his head. \"Come again?\"\r\n\r\n\"You think eating ten thousand calories a day is easy? It's hell on\r\nyour digestive system. Not to mention you spend a fortune on food. A\r\nlot of people get to college and just switch to high-calorie powdered\r\nsupplements because they can't afford enough real food to stay\r\nhealthy, so you've got all these kids sucking down vanilla slurry all\r\nday just to keep from starving. We provide counseling and mitigation\r\ntherapies to kids who want it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when they get out of college -- do they get the treatment again?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't. The mitigation's permanent. People who take it have to go\r\nthrough the rest of their lives taking supplements and eating sensibly\r\nand exercising.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they get fat?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked away, then down, then back up at him. \"Yes, most of them\r\ndo. How could they not? Everything around them is geared at people who\r\nneed to eat five times as much as they do. Even the salads all have\r\nprotein powder mixed in with them. But it is *possible* to eat\r\nright. You've never had the treatment, have you?\"\r\n\r\nPerry shook his head. \"Trick metabolism though. I can eat like a hog\r\nand not put on an ounce.\"\r\n\r\nHilda reached out and squeezed his bicep. \"Really -- and I suppose\r\nthat all that lean muscle there is part of your trick metabolism,\r\ntoo?\"\r\n\r\nShe left her hand where it was.\r\n\r\n\"OK, I do a fair bit of physical labor too. But I'm just saying -- if\r\nthey get fat again after they reverse the treatment --\"\r\n\r\n\"There are worse things than being fat.\"\r\n\r\nHer hand still hadn't moved. He looked at Ernie, whom he'd assumed was\r\nher boyfriend, to see how he was taking it. Ernie was looking\r\nsomewhere else, though, across the ratshkeller, at the huge TV that\r\nwas showing competitive multiplayer gaming, apparently some kind of\r\nchampionships. It was as confusing as a hundred air-hockey games being\r\nplayed on the same board, with thousands of zipping, jumping, firing\r\nentities and jump-cuts so fast that Perry couldn't imagine how you'd\r\nmake sense of it.\r\n\r\nThe girl's hand was still on his arm, and it was warm. His mouth was\r\ndry but more beer would be a bad idea. \"How about some water?\" he\r\nsaid, in a bit of a croak.\r\n\r\nLuke jumped up to get some, and a silence fell over the table. \"So\r\nthis clinic, how'd you fundraise for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Papercraft,\" she said. \"I have a lot of friends who are into\r\npaper-folding and we modded a bunch of patterns. We did really big\r\npieces, too -- bed-frames, sofas, kitchen-tables, chairs --\"\r\n\r\n\"Like actual furniture?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like actual furniture,\" she said with a solemn nod. \"We used huge\r\nsheets of paper and treated them with stiffening, waterproofing and\r\nfireproofing agents. We did a frat house's outdoor bar and sauna, with\r\na wind-dynamo -- I even made a steam engine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You made a steam engine out of paper?\" He was agog.\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say that *you're* surprised by building stuff out of\r\nunusual materials?\"\r\n\r\nPerry laughed. \"Point taken.\"\r\n\r\n\"We just got a couple hundred students to do some folding in their\r\nspare time and then sold it on. Everyone on campus needs bookshelves,\r\nso we started with those -- using accordion-folded arched supports\r\nunder each shelf. We could paint or print designs on them, too, but a\r\nlot of people liked them all-white. Then we did chairs, desks,\r\nkitchenette sets, placemats -- you name it. I called the designs\r\n'Multiple Origami.'\"\r\n\r\nPerry sprayed beer out his nose. \"That's awesome!\" he said, wiping up\r\nthe mess with a kleenex that she extracted from a folded paper\r\npurse. Looking closely, he realized that the white baseball cap she\r\nwas wearing was also folded out of paper.\r\n\r\nShe laughed and rummaged some more in her handbag, coming up with a\r\npiece of stiff card. Working quickly and nimbly, she gave it a few\r\ndeft folds along pre-scored lines, and a moment later she was holding\r\na baseball hat that was the twin of the one she was wearing. She\r\nleaned over the table and popped it on his head.\r\n\r\nLuke came back with the water and set it down between them, pouring\r\nout glasses for everyone.\r\n\r\n\"Smooth lid,\" he said, touching the bill of Perry's cap.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" Perry said, draining his water and pouring another\r\nglass. \"Well, you people certainly have some pretty cool stuff going\r\non here.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a great town,\" Luke said expansively, as though he had\r\ntravelled extensively and settled on Madison, Wisconsin as a truly\r\ninternational hotspot. \"We're going to build a kick-ass ride.\"\r\n\r\n\"You going to make it all out of paper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of it, anyway,\" Luke said. \"Hilda wouldn't have it any other\r\nway, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"This one's your show, Luke,\" she said. \"I'm just a fundraiser.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyone hungry?\" Hilda said. \"I want to go eat something that doesn't\r\nhave unidentified organ-meat mixed in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on without me,\" Ernie said. \"I got money on this game.\"\r\n\r\n\"Homework,\" Luke said.\r\n\r\nPerry had just eaten, and had planned on spending this night in his\r\nroom catching up on email. \"Yeah, I'm starving,\" he said. He felt like\r\na high-school kid, but in a good way.\r\n\r\nThey went out for Ukrainian food, which Perry had never had before,\r\nbut the crepes and the blood sausage were tasty enough. Mostly,\r\nthough, he was paying attention to Hilda, who was running down her war\r\nstories from the Multiple Origami fundraiser. There were funny ones,\r\nsad ones, scary ones, triumphant ones.\r\n\r\nEvery one of her stories reminded him of one of his own. She was an\r\norganizer and so was he and they'd been through practically the same\r\nshit. They drank gallons of coffee afterward, getting chucked out when\r\nthe restaurant closed and migrating to a cafe on the main drag where\r\nthey had low tables and sofas, and they never stopped talking.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" Hilda said, stretching and yawning, \"it's coming up on\r\nfour AM.\"\r\n\r\n\"No way,\" he said, but his watch confirmed it. \"Christ.\" He tried to\r\nthink of a casual way of asking her to sleep with him. For all their\r\ntalking, they'd hardly touched on romance -- or maybe there'd been\r\nromance in every word.\r\n\r\n\"I'll walk you to your hotel,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, that's really nice of you,\" he said. His voice sounded fakey and\r\nforced in his ears. All of a sudden, he wasn't tired at all, instead\r\nhis heart was hammering in his chest and his blood sang in his ears.\r\n\r\nThere was hardly any talk on the way back to the hotel, just the\r\nawareness of her steps and his in time with one another over the cold\r\nlate-winter streets. No traffic at that hour, and hardly a sound from\r\nany of the windows they passed. The town was theirs.\r\n\r\nAt the door to his hotel -- another stack of the ubiquitous capsules,\r\nthese geared to visiting parents -- they stopped. They were looking at\r\none another like a couple of googly-eyed kids at the end of a date in\r\na sitcom.\r\n\r\n\"Um, what's your major?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Pure math,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I think I know what that is,\" he said. It was freezing out on the\r\nstreet. \"Theory, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pure math as opposed to applied math,\" she said. \"Do you really care\r\nabout this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" he said. \"Well, yes. But not very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll come into your hotel room, but we're not having sex, OK?\"\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThere was room enough for the two of them in the capsule, but only\r\njust. These were prefabbed in bulk and they came in different sizes --\r\nin the Midwest they were large, the ones stacked up in San Francisco\r\nparking spots were small. Still, he and Hilda were almost in each\r\nother's laps, and he could smell her, feel wisps of her hair tickling\r\nhis ear.\r\n\r\n\"You're really nice,\" he said. Late at night, his ability to be\r\nflippant evaporated. He was left with simple truths, simply\r\ndeclared. \"I like you a lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then you'll have to come back to Madison and check in on the\r\nride, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" he said. He had a planning meeting with Luke and the rest of his\r\ngang the next day, then he was supposed to be headed for Omaha, where\r\nTjan had set up another crew for him to speak to. At this rate, he\r\nwould get back to Florida some time in June.\r\n\r\n\"Perry, you're not a career activist, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope,\" he said. \"I hadn't really imagined that there was such a\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"My parents. Both of them. Here's what being a career activist means:\r\nyou are on the road most of the time. When you get on the road, you\r\nmeet people, have intense experiences with them -- like going to war\r\nor touring with a band. You fall in love a thousand times. And then\r\nyou leave all those people behind. You get off a plane, turn some\r\nstrangers into best friends, get on a plane and forget them until you\r\ncome back into town, and then you take it all back up again.\r\n\r\n\"If you want to survive this, you've got to love that. You've got to\r\nget off a plane, meet people, fall in love with them, treasure every\r\nmoment, and know that moments are all you have. Then you get on a\r\nplane again and you love them forever. Otherwise, every new meeting is\r\nsour because you know how soon it will end. It's like starting to say\r\nyour summer-camp goodbyes before you've even unpacked your\r\nduffel-bag. You've got to embrace -- or at least forget -- that every\r\ngig will end in a day or two.\"\r\n\r\nPerry took a moment to understand this, swallowed a couple times, then\r\nnodded. Lots of people had come in and out of his factory and his ride\r\nover the years. Lester came and went. Suzanne was gone. Tjan was gone\r\nbut was back again. Kettlebelly was no longer in his life at all, a\r\nghost of a memory with a great smile and good cologne. Already he was\r\nforgetting the faces in Boston, the faces in San Francisco. Hilda\r\nwould be a memory in a month.\r\n\r\nHilda patted his hand. \"I have friends in practically every city in\r\nAmerica. My folks campaigned for stem cells up and down every red\r\nstate in the country. I even met superman before he died. He knew my\r\nname. I spent ten years on the road with them, back and forth. The\r\nBush years, a couple years afterward. You can live this way and you\r\ncan be happy, but you've got to have right mind.\r\n\r\n\"What it means is you've got to be able to say things to people you\r\nmeet, like, 'You're really nice,' and mean it, really mean it. But\r\nyou've also got to be cool with the fact that really nice people will\r\nfall out of your life every week, twice a week, and fall back into it\r\nor not. I think you're very nice, too, but we're not gonna be a\r\ncouple, ever. Even if we slept together tonight, you'd be gone\r\ntomorrow night. What you need to ask yourself is whether you want to\r\nhave friends in every city who are glad to see you when you get off\r\nthe plane, or ex-girlfriends in every city who might show up with\r\ntheir new boyfriends, or not at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you telling me this to explain why we're not going to sleep\r\ntogether? I just figured you were dating that guy, Ernie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ernie's my brother,\" she said. \"And yeah, that's kind of why I'm\r\ntelling you this. I've never gone on what you might call a date. With\r\nmy friends, it tends to be more like, you work together, you hang out\r\ntogether, you catch yourself looking into one another's eyes a couple\r\ntimes, then you do a little circling around and then you end up in\r\nyour bed or their bed having hard, energetic sex and then you sort out\r\nsome details and then it lasts as long as it lasts. We've done a\r\ncompressed version of that tonight, and we're up to the sex, and so I\r\nthought we should lay some things on the table, you should forgive the\r\nexpression.\"\r\n\r\nPerry thought back to his double-date with Lester. The girl had been\r\npretty and intelligent and would have taken him home if he'd made the\r\nleast effort. He hadn't, though. This girl was inappropriate in so\r\nmany ways: young, rooted to a city thousands of miles from home -- why\r\nhad he brought her back to the hotel?\r\n\r\nA thought struck him. \"Why do you think I'm going to be getting on and\r\noff planes for the rest of my life? I've got a home to get to.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't been reading the message boards, have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Which message boards?\"\r\n\r\n\"For ride-builders. There are projects starting up everywhere. People\r\nlike what they've heard and what they've seen, and they remember you\r\nfrom the old days and want to get in on the magic you're going to\r\nbring. A lot of us know each other anyway, from other joint\r\nprojects. Everyone's passing the hat to raise your airfare and arguing\r\nabout who's sofa you're going to stay on.\"\r\n\r\nHe'd known that they were there. There were always message-boards. But\r\nthey were just talk -- he never bothered to read them. That was\r\nLester's job. He wanted to make stuff, not chatter. \"Jesus, when the\r\nhell was someone going to tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your guy in Boston, we've been talking to him. He said not to bug\r\nyou, that you were busy enough as it is.\"\r\n\r\nHe did, did he? In the old days, Tjan had been in charge of planning\r\nand he'd been in charge of the ideas: in charge of what to plan. Had\r\nthey come full circle without him noticing? If they had, was that so\r\nbad?\r\n\r\n\"Man, I was really looking forward to spending a couple nights in my\r\nown bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it much more comfortable than this one?\" She thumped the narrow\r\ncoffin-bed, which was surprisingly comfortable, adjustable, heated,\r\nand massaging.\r\n\r\nHe snorted. \"OK, I sleep on a futon on the floor back home, but it's\r\nthe principle of the thing. I just miss home, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"So go home for a couple days after this stop, or the next one. Charge\r\nup your batteries and do your laundry. But I have a feeling that home\r\nis going to be your suitcase pretty soon, Perry my dear.\" Her voice\r\nwas thick with sleep, her eyes heavy-lidded and bleary.\r\n\r\n\"You're probably right.\" He yawned as he spoke. \"Hell, I know you're\r\nright. You're a real smarty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'm too tired to go home,\" she said, \"so I'm a smarty who's\r\nstaying with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe was suddenly wide awake, his heart thumping. \"Um, OK,\" he said,\r\ntrying to sound casual.\r\n\r\nHe turned back the sheets, then, standing facing into the cramped\r\ncorner, took off his jeans and shoes and socks, climbing in between\r\nthe sheets in his underwear and tee. There were undressing noises --\r\nexquisite ones -- and then she slithered in behind him, snuggled up\r\nagainst him. With a jolt, he realized that her bare breasts were\r\npressed to his back. Her arm came around him and rested on his\r\nstomach, which jumped like a spring uncoiling. He felt certain his\r\nerection was emitting a faint cherry-red glow. Her breath was on his\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nHe thought about casually rolling onto his back so that he could kiss\r\nher, but remembered her admonition that they would not be having\r\nsex. Her fingertips traced small circles on his stomach. Each time\r\nthey grazed his navel, his stomach did a flip.\r\n\r\nHe was totally awake now, and when her lips very softly -- so softly\r\nhe barely felt it -- brushed against the base of his skull, he let out\r\na soft moan. Her lips returned, and then her teeth, worrying at the\r\ntendons at the back of his neck with increasing roughness, an\r\nexquisite pain-pleasure that was electric. He was panting, her hand\r\nwas flat on his stomach now, gripping him. His erection strained\r\ntoward it.\r\n\r\nHer hips ground against him and she moved her mouth toward his ear,\r\nnipping at it, the tip of her tongue touching the whorls there. Her\r\nhand was on the move now, sliding over his ribs, her fingertips at his\r\nnipple, softly and then harder, giving it an abrupt hard pinch that\r\nhad some fingernail in it, like a bite from little teeth. He yelped\r\nand she giggled in his ear, sending shivers up his spine.\r\n\r\nHe reached back behind him awkwardly and put his hand on her ass,\r\ndiscovering that she was bare there, too. It was wide and hard, foam\r\nrubber over steel, and he kneaded it, digging his fingers in. She\r\ngroaned in his ear and tugged him onto his back.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his shoulders hit the narrow bed, she was on him, her\r\nelbows on his biceps, pinning him down, her breasts in his face,\r\nfragrant and soft. Her hot, bare crotch ground against his\r\nunderwear. He bit at her tits, hard little bites that made her\r\ngasp. He found a stiff nipple and sucked it into his mouth, beating at\r\nit with his tongue. She pressed her crotch harder against his, hissed\r\nsomething that might have been *yesssss*.\r\n\r\nShe straightened up so that she was straddling him and looking\r\nimperiously down on him. Her braids swung before her. Her eyes were\r\nexultant. Her face was set in an expression of fierce concentration as\r\nshe rocked on him.\r\n\r\nHe dug his fingers into her ass again, all the way around, so that\r\nthey brushed against her labia, her asshole. He pulled at her,\r\ndragging her up her body, tugging her vagina toward his mouth. Once\r\nshe saw what he was after, she knee-walked up the bed in three or four\r\nquick steps and then she was on his face. Her smell and her taste and\r\nher texture and temperature filled his senses, blotting out the room,\r\nblotting out introspection, blotting out everything except for the\r\nsweet urgency.\r\n\r\nHe sucked at her labia before slipping his tongue up her length,\r\nletting it tickle her ass, her opening, her clit. In response, she\r\nground against him, planting her opening over his mouth and he\r\ntongue-fucked her in hard, fast strokes. She reached back and took\r\nhold of his cock, slipping her small, strong hand under the waistband\r\nof his boxers and curling it around his rigid shaft, pumping\r\nvigorously.\r\n\r\nHe moaned into her pussy and that set her shuddering. Now he had her\r\nclit sucked into his mouth and he was lapping at its engorged length\r\nwith short strokes. Her thighs were clamped over his ears, but he\r\ncould still make out her cries, timed with the shuddering of her\r\nthighs, the spasmodic grip on his cock.\r\n\r\nAbruptly she rolled off of him and the world came back. They hadn't\r\nkissed yet. They hadn't said a word. She lay beside him, half on top\r\nof him, shuddering and making kittenish sounds. He kissed her softly,\r\nthen more forcefully. She bit at his lips and his tongue, sucking it\r\ninto her mouth and chewing at it while her fingernails raked his back.\r\n\r\nHer breathing became more regular and she tugged at the waistband of\r\nhis boxers. He got the message and yanked them off, his cock springing\r\nfree and rocking slightly, twitching in time with his pulse. She\r\nsmiled a cat-ate-the-canary grin and went to work kissing his neck,\r\nhis chest -- hard bites on his nipples that made him yelp and arch his\r\nback -- his stomach, his hips, his pubes, his thighs. The teasing was\r\nexcruciating and exquisite. Her juices dried on his face, the smell\r\ncaught in his nose, refreshing his eros with every breath.\r\n\r\nHer tongue lapped eagerly at his balls like a cat with a saucer of\r\nmilk. Long, slow strokes, over his sack, over the skin between his\r\nballs and his thighs, over his perineum, tickling his ass as he'd\r\ntickled hers. She pulled back and spat out a pube and laughed and dove\r\nback in, sucking softly at his sack, then, in one swift motion, taking\r\nhis cock to the hilt.\r\n\r\nHe shouted and then moaned and her head bobbed furiously along the\r\nlength of his shaft, her hand squeezing his balls. It took only\r\nmoments before he dug his hands hard into the mattress and groaned\r\nthrough clenched teeth and fired spasm after spasm down her throat,\r\nher nose in his pubes, his cock down her throat to the base. She\r\nrefused to let him go, swirling her tongue over the head while he was\r\nstill super-sensitive, making him grunt and twitch and buck\r\ninvoluntarily, all the while her hand caressing his balls, rubbing at\r\nhis prostate over the spot between his balls and his ass.\r\n\r\nFinally she worked her way back up his body licking her lips and\r\nkissing as she went.\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" she said as she buried her face in his throat.\r\n\r\n\"Wow,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"So if you're going to be able to live in the moment and have no\r\nregrets, this is a pretty good place to start. It'd be a hell of a\r\nshock if we saw each other twice in the next year -- are we going to\r\nbe able to be friends when we do? Will the fact that I fucked your\r\nbrains out make things awkward?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why you jumped me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not really. I was horny and you're hot. But that's a good\r\npost-facto reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. You know, you haven't actually fucked my brains out,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yet,\" she said. She retrieved her backpack from beside the bed, dug\r\naround it in, and produced a strip of condoms. \"Yet.\"\r\n\r\nHe licked his lips in anticipation, and a moment later she was\r\nunrolling the condom down his shaft with her talented mouth. He\r\nlaughed and then took her by the waist and flipped her onto her\r\nback. She grabbed her ankles and pulled her legs wide and he dove\r\nbetween her, dragging the still-sensitive tip of his cock up and down\r\nthe length of her vulva a couple times before sawing it in and out of\r\nher opening, sinking to the hilt.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to fuck her gently but she groaned urgent demands in his ear\r\nto pound her harder, making satisfied sounds each time his balls\r\nclapped against her ass.\r\n\r\nShe pushed him off her and turned over, raising her ass in the air,\r\npulling her labia apart and looking over her shoulder at him. They\r\nfucked doggy-style then, until his legs trembled and his knees ached,\r\nand then she climbed on him and rocked back and forth, grinding her\r\nclit against his pubis, pushing him so deep inside her. He mauled her\r\ntits and felt the pressure build in his balls. He pulled her to him,\r\nthrust wildly, and she hissed dirty encouragement in his ear, begging\r\nhim to fill her, ordering him to pound her harder. The stimulation in\r\nhis brain and between his legs was too much to bear and he came,\r\nlifting them both off the bed with his spasms.\r\n\r\n\"Wow,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yum,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus, it's 8AM,\" he said. \"I've got to meet with Luke in three\r\nhours.\"\r\n\r\n\"So let's take a shower now, and set an alarm for half an hour before\r\nhe's due,\" she said. \"Got anything to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I like about you Hilda,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Businesslike. Vigorous. Living life to the hilt.\"\r\n\r\nHer dimples were pretty and luminous in the hints of light emerging\r\nfrom under the blinds. \"Feed me,\" she said, and nipped at his earlobe.\r\n\r\nIn the shoebox-sized fridge, he had a cow-shaped brick of Wisconsin\r\ncheddar that he'd been given when he stepped off the plane. They broke\r\nchunks off it and ate it in bed, then started in on the bag of soy\r\ncrispies his hosts in San Francisco had given him. They showered\r\nslowly together, scrubbing one-another's backs, set an alarm, and\r\nsacked out for just a few hours before the alarm roused them.\r\n\r\nThey dressed like strangers, not embarrassed, just too groggy to take\r\nmuch notice of one another. Perry's muscles ached pleasantly, and\r\nthere was another ache, dull and faint, even more pleasant, in his\r\nballs.\r\n\r\nOnce they were fully clothed, she grabbed him and gave him a long hug,\r\nand a warm kiss that started on his throat and moved to his mouth,\r\nwith just a hint of tongue at the end.\r\n\r\n\"You're a good man, Perry Gibbons,\" she said. \"Thanks for a lovely\r\nnight. Remember what I told you, though: no regrets, no looking\r\nback. Be happy about this -- don't mope, don't miss me. Go on to your\r\nnext city and make new friends and have new conversations, and when we\r\nsee each other again, be my friend without any awkwardness. All\r\nright?\"\r\n\r\n\"I get it,\" he said. He felt slightly irritated. \"Only one thing. We\r\nweren't going to sleep together.\"\r\n\r\n\"You regret it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" he said. \"But it's going to make this injunction of\r\nyours hard to understand. I'm not good at anonymous one night stands.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised one eyebrow at him. \"Earth to Perry: this wasn't anonymous,\r\nand it wasn't a one-night stand. It was an intimate, loving\r\nrelationship that happened to be compressed into a single day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Loving?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. If I'd been with you for a month or two, I would have fallen in\r\nlove. You're just my type. So I think of you as someone I love. That's\r\nwhy I want to make sure you understand what this all means.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a very interesting person,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm smart,\" she said, and cuddled him again. \"You're smart. So be\r\nsmart about this and it'll be forever sweet.\"\r\n\r\nShe left him off at the spot where he was supposed to meet Luke and\r\nthe rest of his planning team to go over schematics and theory and\r\npractice. All of these discussions could happen online -- they did, in\r\nfact -- but there was something about the face-to-face connection. The\r\nmeeting ran six hours before he was finally saved by his impending\r\nflight to Nebraska.\r\n\r\nSleepdep came down on him like a hammer as he checked in for his\r\nflight and began the ritual security-clearing buck-and-wing. He missed\r\na cue or two and ended up getting a \"detailed hand search\" but even\r\nthat didn't wake him up. He fell asleep in the waiting room and in the\r\nplane, in the taxi to his hotel.\r\n\r\nBut when he dropped down onto his hotel bed, he couldn't sleep. The\r\nhotel was the spitting image of the one he'd left in Wisconsin, minus\r\nHilda and the musky smell the two of them had left behind after their\r\nroll in the hay.\r\n\r\nIt had been years since he'd had a regular girlfriend and he'd never\r\nmissed it. There had been women, high-libido fatkins girls and random\r\nstrangers, some who came back for a date or two. But no one who'd\r\nmeant anything or whom he'd wanted to mean anything. The closest he'd\r\ncome had been -- he sat up with a start and realized that the last\r\nwoman he'd had any strong feelings for had been Suzanne Church.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nKettlewell emerged from New Work rich. He'd taken home large bonuses\r\nevery year that Kodacell had experienced growth -- a better metric\r\nthan turning an actual ahem profit -- and he'd invested in a diverse\r\nportfolio that had everything from soybeans to software in it, along\r\nwith real estate (oops) and fine art. He believed in the New Work,\r\nbelieved in it with every fiber of his being, but an undiverse\r\nportfolio was flat-out irresponsible.\r\n\r\nThe New Work crash had killed the net worth of a lot of irresponsible\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nLiving in the Caymans got boring after a year. The kids hated the\r\ninternational school, scuba diving amazed him by going from endlessly,\r\nmeditatively fascinating to deadly dull in less than a year. He didn't\r\nwant to sail. He didn't want to get drunk. He didn't want to join the\r\ncreepy zillionaires on their sex tours of the Caribbean and wouldn't\r\nhave even if his wife would have stood for it.\r\n\r\nA year after the New Work crash, he filed a 1040 with the IRS and paid\r\nthem forty million dollars in back taxes and penalties, and\r\nrepatriated his wealth to an American bank.\r\n\r\nNow he lived in a renovated housing project on Potrero Hill in San\r\nFrancisco, all upscale now with restored, kitschy window-bars and\r\nvintage linoleum and stucco ceilings. He had four units over two\r\nfloors, with cleverly knocked-through walls and a spiral\r\nstaircase. The kids freaking loved the staircase.\r\n\r\nSuzanne Church called him from SFO to let him know that she was on her\r\nway in, having cleared security and customs after a scant hour. He\r\nfound himself unaccountably nervous about her now, and realized with a\r\nlittle giggle that he had something like a crush on her. Nothing\r\nserious -- nothing his wife needed to worry about -- but she was smart\r\nand funny and attractive and incisive and fearless, and it was a hell\r\nof a combination.\r\n\r\nThe kids were away at school and his wife was having a couple of days\r\ncamping with the girls in Yosemite, which facts lent a little charge\r\nto Suzanne's impending visit. He looked up the AirBART schedule and\r\ncalculated how long he had until she arrived at the 24th Street\r\nstation, a brisk 20 minute walk from his place.\r\n\r\nMinutes, just minutes. He checked the guest-room and then did a quick\r\nmirror check. His months in the Caymans had given him a deep tan that\r\nhe'd kept up despite San Francisco's grey skies. He still looked like\r\na surfer, albeit with just a little daddy-paunch -- he'd gained more\r\nweight through his wife's pregnancies than she had and only hard,\r\naneurysm-inducing cycling over and around Potrero Hill had knocked it\r\noff again. His jeans' neat rows of pockets and Mobius seams were a\r\nlittle outdated, but they looked good on him, as did his Hawai'ian\r\nprint shirt with its machine-screw motif.\r\n\r\nFinally he plopped down to read a book and waited for Suzanne, and\r\nmanaged to get through a whole page in the intervening ten minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Kettlebelly!\" she hollered as she came through the door. She took him\r\nin a hug that smelled of stale airplane and restless sleep and gave\r\nhim a thorough squeezing.\r\n\r\nShe held him at arm's length and they sized each other up. She'd been\r\na well-preserved mid-forties when he'd seen her last, buttoned-down in\r\na California-yoga-addict way. Now she was years older, and her time in\r\nRussia had given her a forest of smile-lines at the corners of her\r\nmouth and eyes. She had a sad, wise turn to her face that he'd never\r\nseen there before, like a painted Pieta. Her hands had gone a little\r\nwrinkly, her knuckles more prominent, but her fingernails were\r\nbeautifully manicured and her clothes were stylish, foreign, exotic\r\nand European.\r\n\r\nShe laughed huskily and said, \"You haven't changed a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ouch,\" he said. \"I'm older and wiser, I'll have you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't show,\" she said. \"I'm older, but no wiser.\"\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and looked at the simple platinum band on her\r\nfinger. \"But you're married now -- nothing wises you up faster in my\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at her hand. \"Oh, that. No. That's just to keep the wolves\r\nat bay. Married women aren't the same kinds of targets that single\r\nones are. Give me water, and then a beer, please.\"\r\n\r\nGlad to have something to do, he busied himself in the kitchen while\r\nshe prowled the place. \"I remember when these places were bombed-out,\r\nreal ghettos.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you mean about being a target?\"\r\n\r\n\"St Pete's, you know. Lawless state. Everyone's on the make. I had a\r\nbodyguard most of the time, but if I wanted to go to a restaurant, I\r\ndidn't want to have to fend off the dating-service mafiyeh who wanted\r\nto offer me the deal of a lifetime on a green-card marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jeez.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's another world, Landon. You know what the big panic there is this\r\nweek? A cult of ecstatic evangelical Christians who 'hypnotize' women\r\nin the shopping malls and steal their babies to raise as soldiers to\r\nthe Lord. God knows how much of it is true. These guys don't bathe,\r\nand dress in heavy coats with big beards all year round. I mean,\r\nfreaky, really freaky.\"\r\n\r\n\"They hypnotize women?\"\r\n\r\n\"Weird, yeah? And the *driving*! Anyone over the age of fifty who\r\nknows how to drive got there by being an apparat in the Soviet days,\r\nwhich means that they learned to drive when the roads were empty. They\r\ndon't signal, they straddle lanes, they can't park -- I mean, they\r\n*really* can't park. And drunk! Everyone, all the time! You've never\r\nseen the like. Imagine a frat party the next day, with a lot of\r\ninnocent bystanders, hookers, muggers and pickpockets.\"\r\n\r\nLandon looked at her. She was animated and vivid, thin -- age had\r\nbrought out her cheekbones and her eyes. Had she had a chin-tuck? It\r\nwas common enough -- all the medical tourists loved Russia. Maybe she\r\nwas just well-preserved.\r\n\r\nShe made a show of sniffing herself. \"Phew! I need a shower! Can I\r\nborrow your facilities?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"I put clean towels out in the kids' bathroom --\r\nupstairs and second on the right.\"\r\n\r\nShe came down with her fine hair slicked back over her ears, her face\r\nscrubbed and shining. \"I'm a new woman,\" she said. \"Let's go somewhere\r\nand eat something, OK?\"\r\n\r\nHe took her for pupusas at a Salvadoran place on Goat Hill. They\r\nslogged up and down the hills and valleys, taking the steps cut into\r\nthe steep sides, walking past the Painted Ladies -- grand, gaudy\r\nVictorian wood-frames -- and the wobbly, heavy canvas bubble-houses\r\nthat had sprung up where the big quake and landslides had washed away\r\nparts of the hills.\r\n\r\n\"I'd forgotten that they had hills like that,\" she said, greedily\r\nguzzling an horchata. Her face was streaked with sweat and flushed --\r\nit made her look prettier, younger.\r\n\r\n\"My son and I walk them every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You drag a little kid up and down that every *day*? Christ, that's\r\nchild abuse!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he poops out after a couple of peaks and I end up carrying\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"You *carry* him? You must be some kind of superman.\" She gave his\r\nbicep a squeeze, then his thigh, then slapped his butt. \"A fine\r\nspecimen. Your wife's a lucky woman.\"\r\n\r\nHe grinned. Having his wife in the conversation made him feel less at\r\nrisk. *That's right, I'm married and we both know it. This is just fun\r\nflirting. Nothing more.*\r\n\r\nThey bit into their pupusas -- stuffed cornmeal dumplings filled with\r\ngrilled pork and topped with shredded cabbage and hot sauce -- and\r\ngrunted and ate and ordered more.\r\n\r\n\"What are these called again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pupusas, from El Salvador.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph. In my day, we ate Mexican burritos the size of a football, and\r\nwe were grateful.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one eats burritos anymore,\" he said, then covered his mouth, aware\r\nof how pretentious that sounded.\r\n\r\n\"Dahling,\" she said, \"burritos are *so* 2005. You *must* try a pupusa\r\n-- it's what all the most charming Central American peasants are\r\neating now.\"\r\n\r\nThey both laughed and stuffed their faces more. \"Well, it was either\r\nhere or one of the fatkins places with the triple-decker stuffed\r\npizzas, and I figured --\"\r\n\r\n\"They really do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The fatkins? Yeah -- anything to get that magical 10,000 calories any\r\nday. It must be the same in Russia, right? I mean, they invented it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe for fifteen minutes. But most of them don't bother -- they get\r\na little metabolic tweak, not a wide-open throttle like that. Christ,\r\nwhat it must do to your digestive system to process 10,000 calories a\r\nday!\"\r\n\r\n\"Chacun a son gout,\" he said, essaying a Gallic shrug.\r\n\r\nShe laughed again and they ate some more. \"I'm starting to feel human\r\nat last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me too.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's still mid-afternoon, but my circadian thinks it's 2AM. I need to\r\ndo something to stay awake or I'll be up at four tomorrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have some modafinil,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Swore 'em off. Let's go for a walk.\"\r\n\r\nThey did a little more hill-climbing and then headed into the Mission\r\nand window-shopped the North African tchotchke emporia that were\r\ncrowding out the Mexican rodeo shops and hairdressers. The skin drums\r\nand rattles were laser-etched with intricate designs -- Coca Cola\r\nlogos, the UN Access to Essential Medicines Charter, Disney\r\ncharacters. It put them both in mind of the old days of the New Work,\r\nand the subject came up again, hesitant at first and then a full-bore\r\nreminisce.\r\n\r\nSuzanne told him stories of the things that Perry and Lester had done\r\nthat she'd never dared report on, the ways they'd skirted the law and\r\nhis orders. He told her a few stories of his own, and they rocked with\r\nlaughter in the street, staggering like drunks, pounding each other on\r\nthe backs, gripping their knees and stomachs and doubling over to the\r\ncurious glances of the passers-by.\r\n\r\nIt was fine, that day, Landon thought. Some kind of great sorrow that\r\nhe'd forgotten he'd carried lifted from him and his chest and\r\nshoulders expanded and he breathed easy. What was the sorrow? The\r\ndeath of the New Work. The death of the dot-coms. The death of\r\neverything he'd considered important and worthy, its fading into\r\ntawdry, cheap nostalgia.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting in the grass in Dolores Park now, watching the dogs\r\nand their people romp among the robot pooper-scoopers. He had his arm\r\naround her shoulders, like war-buddies on a bender (he told himself)\r\nand not like a middle-aged man flirting with a woman he hadn't seen in\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAnd then they were lying down, the ache of laughter in their bellies,\r\nthe sun on their faces, the barks and happy shouts around them. Their\r\nhands twined together (but that was friendly too, Arab men held hands\r\nwalking down the street as a way of showing friendship).\r\n\r\nNow their talk had banked down to coals, throwing off an occasional\r\nspark when one or the other would remember some funny anecdote and\r\ngrunt out a word or two that would set them both to gingerly\r\nchuckling. But their hands were tied and their breathing was in sync,\r\nand their flanks were touching and it wasn't just friendly.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, she shook her hand free and rolled on her side. \"Listen,\r\nmarried man, I think that's enough of that.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt his face go red. His ears rang. \"Suzanne -- what --\" He was\r\nsputtering.\r\n\r\n\"No harm no foul, but let's keep it friendly, all right.\"\r\n\r\nThe spell was broken, and the sorrow came back. He looked for the\r\nright thing to say. \"God I miss it,\" he said. \"Oh, Suzanne, God, I\r\nmiss it so much, every day.\"\r\n\r\nHer face fell, too. \"Yeah.\" She looked away. \"I really thought we were\r\nchanging the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were,\" he said. \"We did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said again. \"But it didn't matter in the end, did it? Now\r\nwe're older and our work is forgotten and it's all come to\r\nnothing. Petersburg is nice, but who gives a shit? Is that what I'm\r\ngoing to do with the rest of my life, hang around Petersburg blogging\r\nabout the mafiyeh and medical tourism? Just shoot me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I miss the people. I'd meet ten amazing creative geniuses every day\r\n-- at least! Then I'd give them money and they'd make amazing stuff\r\nhappen with it. The closest I come to that now is my kids, watching\r\nthem learn and build stuff, which is really great, don't get me wrong,\r\nbut it's nothing like the old days.\"\r\n\r\n\"I miss Lester. And Perry. Tjan. The whole gang of them, really.\" She\r\npropped herself up on one elbow and then shocked him by kissing him\r\nhard on the cheek. \"Thanks, Kettlebelly. Thank you so much for putting\r\nme in the middle of all that. You changed my life, that's for sure.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt the imprint of her lips glowing on his cheek and grinned. \"OK,\r\nhere's an idea: let's go buy a couple bottles of wine, sit on my\r\npatio, get a glow on, and then call Perry and see what he's up to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's a good one,\" she said. \"That's a *very* good one.\"\r\n\r\nA few hours later, they sat on the horsehair club-sofa in Kettlewell's\r\nliving room and hit a number he'd never taken out of his\r\nspeed-dial. \"Hi, this is Perry. Leave a message.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perry!\" they chorused. They looked at each other, at a loss for what\r\nto say next, then dissolved in peals of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Perry, it's Suzanne and Kettlebelly. What the hell are you up to?\r\nCall us!\"\r\n\r\nThey looked at the phone with renewed hilarity and laughed some\r\nmore. But by the time the sun was setting over Potrero Hill and\r\nSuzanne's jet-lag was beating her up again, they'd both descended into\r\ntheir own personal funks. Suzanne went up to the guest room and put\r\nherself to bed, not bothering to brush her teeth or even change into\r\nher nightie.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nPerry touched down in Miami in a near-coma, his eyes gummed shut by\r\nseveral days' worth of hangovers chased by drink. Sleep deprivation\r\nmade him uncoordinated, so he tripped twice deplaning, and his voice\r\nwas a barely audible rasp, his throat sore with a cold he'd picked up\r\nin Texas or maybe it was Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nLester was waiting beyond the luggage carousels, grinning like a holy\r\nfool, tall and broad-shouldered and tanned, dressed in fatkins\r\npimped-out finery, all tight stretch-fabrics and glitter.\r\n\r\n\"Oh man, you look like shit,\" he said, breaking off from the fatkins\r\ngirl he'd been chatting up. Perry noticed that he was holding his\r\nphone, a sure sign that he'd gotten her number.\r\n\r\n\"Ten,\" Perry said, grinning through the snotty rheum of his cold. \"Ten\r\nrides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten rides?\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"Ten. San Francisco, Austin, Minneapolis, Omaha, Oklahoma City,\r\nMadison, Bellingham, Chapel Hill and --\" He faltered. \"And -- Shit. I\r\nforget. It's all written down.\"\r\n\r\nLester took his bag from him and set it down, then crushed him in an\r\nenormous, muscular hug that whiffed slightly of the ketosis fumes that\r\nall the fatkins exuded.\r\n\r\n\"You did good, cowboy,\" he said. \"Let's mosey back to the ranch, feed\r\nyou and put you to bed, s'awright?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I sleep in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Until April?\"\r\n\r\nLester laughed and slipped one of Perry's arms over his shoulders and\r\npicked up his suitcase and walked them back through the parking lot to\r\nhis latest hotrod.\r\n\r\nPerry breathed in the hot, wet air as they went, feeling it open his\r\nchest and nasal passages. His eyes were at half mast, but the sight of\r\nthe sickly roadside palms, the wandering vendors on the traffic\r\nislands with their net bags full of ipods and vpods -- he was home,\r\nand his body knew it.\r\n\r\nLester cooked him a huge plate of scrambled eggs with corned beef,\r\npastrami, salami and cheese, with a mountain of sauerkraut on\r\ntop. \"There you go, fatten you up. You're all skinny and haggard,\r\nbuddy.\" Lester was an expert at throwing together high-calorie meals\r\non short order.\r\n\r\nPerry stuffed away as much as he could, then collapsed on his old bed\r\nwith his old sheets and his old pillows, and in seconds he was\r\nsleeping the best sleep he'd had in months.\r\n\r\nWhen he woke the next day, his cold had turned into a horrible, wet,\r\ncrusty thing that practically had his face glued to his pillow. Lester\r\ncame in, took a good look at him, and came back with a quart of fresh\r\norange juice, a pot of tea, and a stack of dry toast, along with a\r\npack of cold pills.\r\n\r\n\"Take *all* of this and then come down to the ride when you're\r\nready. I'll hold down the fort for another couple days if that's what\r\nit takes.\"\r\n\r\nPerry spent the day in his bathrobe, shuttling between the living room\r\nand the sun-chairs on the patio, letting the heat bake some of the\r\nsnot out of his head. Lester's kindness and his cold made him\r\nnostalgic for his youth, when his father doted on his illnesses.\r\n\r\nPerry's father was a little man. Perry -- no giant himself -- was\r\ntaller than the old man by the time he turned 13. His father had\r\nalways reminded him of some clever furry animal, a raccoon or\r\nbadger. He had tiny hands and his movements were small and precise and\r\ncareful.\r\n\r\nThey were mostly cordial and friendly, but distant. His father worked\r\nas a CAD/CAM manager in a machine shop, though he'd started out his\r\ncareer as a plain old machinist. Of all the machinists he'd started\r\nwith at the shop, only he had weathered the transition to the new\r\ncomputerized devices. The others had all lost their jobs or taken\r\nearly retirement or just quit, but his father had taken to CAD/CAM\r\nwith total abandon, losing himself in the screens and staggering home\r\nbleary after ten or fifteen hours in front of the screen.\r\n\r\nBut that all changed when Perry took ill. Perry's father loved to play\r\nnurse. He'd book off from work and stay home, ferrying up gallons of\r\ntea and beef broth, flat ginger-ale and dry toast, cold tablets and\r\ncough syrup. He'd open the windows when it was warm and then run\r\naround the house shutting them at the first sign of a cool breeze.\r\n\r\nBest of all was what his father would do when Perry got restless: he\r\nand Perry would go down to the living-room, where the upright piano\r\nstood. It had been Perry's grandfather's, and the old man -- who'd\r\ndied before Perry was born -- had been a jazz pianist who'd played\r\nsessions with everyone from Cab Calloway to Duke Ellington.\r\n\r\n\"You ready, P?\" his father would ask.\r\n\r\nPerry always nodded, watching his father sit down at the bench and try\r\na few notes.\r\n\r\nThen his father would play, tinkling and then pounding, running up and\r\ndown the keyboard in an improvised jazz recital that could go for\r\nhours, sometimes only ending once Perry's mom came home from work at\r\nthe framing shop.\r\n\r\nNothing in Perry's life since had the power to capture him the way his\r\nfather's music did. His fingers danced, literally *danced* on the\r\nkeys, walking up and down them like a pair of high-kicking legs,\r\nmaking little comedy movements. The little stubby fingers with their\r\ntufts of hair on the knuckles, like goat's legs, nimbly prancing and\r\nturning.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was the *music*. Perry sometimes played with the piano\r\nand he'd figured out that if you hit every other key with three\r\nfingers, you got a chord. But Perry's dad almost never made chords: he\r\nmade anti-chords, sounds that involved those mysterious black keys and\r\nclashed in a way that was *precisely* not a chord, that jangled and\r\njarred.\r\n\r\nThe anti-chords made up anti-tunes. Somewhere in the music there'd be\r\none or more melodies, often the stuff that Perry listened to in his\r\nroom, but sometimes old jazz and blues standards.\r\n\r\nThe music would settle into long runs of improvisational noise that\r\nwasn't *quite* noise. That was the best stuff, because Perry could\r\nnever tell if there was a melody in there. Sometimes he'd be sure that\r\nhe had the know of it, could tell what was coming next, a segue into\r\n\"Here Comes the Sun\" or \"Let the Good Times Roll\" or \"Merrily We Roll\r\nAlong,\" but then his father would get to that spot and he'd move into\r\nsomething else, some other latent pattern that was unmistakable in\r\nhindsight.\r\n\r\nThere was a joke his dad liked, \"Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies\r\nlike a banana.\" This was funny in just that way: you expected one\r\nthing, you got something else, and when your expectations fell apart\r\nlike that, it was pure hilarity. You wanted to clutch your sides and\r\nroll on the floor sometimes, it was so funny.\r\n\r\nHis dad usually closed his eyes while he played, squeezing them shut,\r\nletting his mouth hang open slightly. Sometimes he grunted or scatted\r\nalong with his playing but more often he grunted out something that\r\nwas kind of the *opposite* of what he was playing, just like sometimes\r\nthe melody and rhythms he played on the piano were sometimes the\r\nopposite of the song he was playing, something that was exactly and\r\nperfectly opposite, so you couldn't hear it without hearing the thing\r\nit was the opposite of.\r\n\r\nThe game would end when his dad began to improvise on parts of the\r\npiano besides the keys, knocking on it, reaching in to pluck its\r\nstrings like a harp, rattling Perry's teacup on its saucer just so.\r\n\r\nNothing made him feel better faster. It was a tonic, a fine one,\r\nbetter than pills and tea and toast, daytime TV and flat ginger-ale.\r\n\r\nAs Perry got older, he and the old man had their share of fights over\r\nthe normal things: girls, partying, school... But every time Perry\r\ntook ill, he was transported back to his boyhood and those amazing\r\npiano recitals, his father's stubby fingers doing their comic\r\nhigh-kicks and pratfalls on the keys, the grunting anti-song in the\r\nback of his throat, those crazy finales with teacups and piano\r\nstrings.\r\n\r\nNow he stared morosely at the empty swimming pool six stories below\r\nhis balcony, filled with blowing garbage, leaves, and a huge wasps'\r\nnest. His father's music was in his ears, distantly now and fading\r\nwith his cold. He should call the old man, back home in Westchester\r\nCounty, retired now. They talked only rarely these days, three or four\r\ntimes a year on birthdays and anniversaries. No fight had started\r\ntheir silence, only busy lives grown apart.\r\n\r\nHe should call the old man, but instead he got dressed and went for a\r\njog around the block, trying to get the wet sick wheeze out of his\r\nwhistling breath, stopping a couple times to blow his nose. The sun\r\nwas like a blowtorch on his hair, which had grown out of his normal\r\nduckling fuzz into something much shaggier. His head baked, the cold\r\nbaked with it, and by the time he got home and chugged a quart of\r\norange juice, he was feeling fully human again and ready for a shower,\r\nstreet clothes and a turn at the old ticket-window at work.\r\n\r\nThe queue snaked all the way through the market and out to the street,\r\nwhere the line had a casual, party kind of atmosphere. The market kids\r\nwere doing a brisk business in popsicles, homemade colas, and clever\r\norigami stools and sun-beds made from recycled cardboard. Some of the\r\nkids recognized him and waved, then returned to their hustle.\r\n\r\nHe followed the queue through the stalls. The vendors were happier\r\nthan the kids, if that was possible, selling stuff as fast as they\r\ncould set it out. The queue had every conceivable kind of person in\r\nit: old and young, hipsters and conservative rawboned southerners,\r\nLatina moms with their babies, stone-faced urban homeboys, crackers,\r\nand Miami Beach queers in pastel shorts. There were old Jewish couples\r\nand smartly turned out European tourists with their funny two-tone\r\nshag cuts and the filter masks that they smoked around. There was a\r\nno-fooling Korean tour group, of the sort he'd seen now and again in\r\nDisney World, led by a smart lady in a sweltering little suit, holding\r\nan umbrella over her head.\r\n\r\n\"Lester, what the *fuck*?\" he said, grinning and laughing as he\r\nclapped Lester on the shoulder, taking a young mall-goth's five bucks\r\nout of a hand whose fingernails were painted with chipped black\r\npolish. \"What the hell is going on here?\"\r\n\r\nLester laughed. \"I was saving this for a surprise, buddy. Record\r\ncrowds -- growing every day. There's a line up in the morning no\r\nmatter how early I open and no matter what time I close, I turn people\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\n\"How'd they all find out about it?\"\r\n\r\nLester shrugged. \"Word of mouth,\" he said. \"Best advertising you can\r\nhave. Shit, Perry, you just got back from ten cities where they want\r\nto clone this thing -- how did *they* find out about it?\"\r\n\r\nPerry shook his head and marveled at the queue some more. The Korean\r\ntour group was coming up on them, and Perry nudged Lester aside and\r\ngot out his ticket-roll, the familiar movements lovely after all that\r\ntime on the road.\r\n\r\nThe tour guide put a stack of twenties down on the counter. \"I got\r\nfifty of 'em,\" she said. \"That's two hundred and fifty bucks.\" She had\r\nan American accent, somewhere south of the Mason-Dixon line. Perry had\r\nbeen expecting a Korean accent, broken English.\r\n\r\nPerry riffled the bills. \"I'll take your word for it.\"\r\n\r\nShe winked at him. \"They got off the plane and they were all like,\r\n'Screw Disney, we have one of those in Seoul, what's *new*, what's\r\n*American*?' So I took them here. You guys totally rock.\"\r\n\r\nHe could have kissed her. His heart took wing. \"In you go,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Lester will get you the extra ride vehicles.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're all in there already,\" he said. \"I've been running the whole\r\nfleet for two weeks and I've got ten more on order.\"\r\n\r\nPerry whistled. \"You shoulda said,\" he said, then turned back to the\r\ntour guide. \"It might be a little bit of a wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten, fifteen minutes,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"No *problem*,\" she said. \"They'll wait till kingdom come, provided\r\nthere's good shopping to be had.\" Indeed the tour group was at the\r\ncenter of a pack of vendor-kids, hawking busts and tattoos, contacts\r\nand action-figures, kitchenware and cigarette lighters.\r\n\r\nOnce she was gone, Lester gave his shoulder another squeeze. \"I hired\r\ntwo more kids to bring the ride cars back around to the entrance.\"\r\nWhen Perry had left, that had been a once-daily chore, something you\r\ndid before shutting down for the night.\r\n\r\n\"Holy crap,\" Perry said, watching the tour group edge toward the\r\nentrance, slip inside in ones and twos.\r\n\r\n\"It's amazing, isn't it?\" Lester said. \"And wait till you see the\r\nride!\"\r\n\r\nPerry didn't get a chance to ride until much later that day, once the\r\nsun had set and the last market-stall had been shut and the last rider\r\nhad been chased home, when he and Lester slugged back bottles of flat\r\ndistilled water from their humidity-still and sat on the ticket\r\ncounter to get the weight off their tired feet.\r\n\r\n\"Now we ride,\" Lester said. \"You're going to *love* this.\"\r\n\r\nThe first thing he noticed was that the ride had become a lot less\r\nopen. When he'd left, there'd been the sense that you were in a giant\r\nroom -- all that dead Wal-Mart -- with little exhibits spread around\r\nit, like the trade-floor at a monster-car show. But now the exhibits\r\nhad been arranged out of one another's sight-lines, and some of the\r\ntaller pieces had been upended to form baffles. It was much more like\r\na carny haunted house trade-show floor now.\r\n\r\nThe car circled slowly in the first \"room,\" which had accumulated a\r\nlot of junk that wasn't mad inventions from the heyday of New\r\nWork. There was a chipped doll-cradle, and a small collection of\r\ngirls' dolls, a purse spilled on the floor with photos of young girls\r\nclowning at a birthday party. He reached for the joystick with\r\nirritation and slammed it toward minus one -- what the hell was this\r\ncrap?\r\n\r\nNext was a room full of boys' tanks and cars and trading cards, some\r\nin careful packages and frames, some lovingly scuffed and beaten\r\nup. They were from all eras, and he recognized some of his beloved\r\ntoys from his own boyhood among the mix. The items were arranged in\r\nconcentric rings -- one of the robots' default patterns for displaying\r\nmaterials -- around a writhing tower of juddering, shuddering domestic\r\nrobots that had piled one atop the other. The vogue for these had been\r\nmercifully brief, but it had been intense, and for Perry, the\r\njuxtaposition of the cars and the cards, the tanks and the robots made\r\nsomething catch in his throat. There was a statement here about the\r\ndrive to automate household chores and the simple pleasure of rolling\r\nan imaginary tank over the imaginary armies of your imaginary\r\nenemies. So, too, something about the collecting urge, the need to get\r\nevery card in a set, and then to get each in perfect condition, and\r\nthen to arrange them in perfect order, and then to forget them\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nHis hand had been jerking the joystick to plus one all this time and\r\nnow he became consciously aware of this.\r\n\r\nThe next room had many of the old inventions he remembered, but they\r\nwere arranged not on gleaming silver tables, but were mixed in with\r\nheaps of clothing, mountains of the brightly colored ubiquitous\r\nt-shirts that had gone hand in hand with every New Work invention and\r\ncrew. Mixed in among them were some vintage tees from the dotcom era,\r\nand perched on top of the mountain, staring glassily at him, was a\r\nlittle girl-doll that looked familiar; he was almost certain that he'd\r\nseen her in the first doll room.\r\n\r\nThe next room was built out of pieces of the old \"kitchen\" display,\r\nbut there was disarray now, dishes in the sink and a plate on the\r\ncounter with a cigarette butted out in the middle of it. Another plate\r\nlay in three pieces on the linoleum before it.\r\n\r\nThe next room was carpeted with flattened soda tins that crunched\r\nunder the chair's wheels. In the center of them, a neat workbench with\r\nranked tools.\r\n\r\nThe ride went on and on, each room utterly different from how he'd\r\nleft it, but somehow familiar too. The ride he'd left had celebrated\r\nthe New Work and the people who'd made it happen, and so did this\r\nride, but this ride was less linear, less about display more --\r\n\r\n\"It's a story,\" he said when he got off.\r\n\r\n\"I think so too,\" Lester said. \"It's been getting more and more\r\nstory-like. The way that doll keeps reappearing. I think that someone\r\nhad like ten of them and just tossed them out at regular intervals and\r\nthen the plus-oneing snuck one into every scene.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's got scenes! That's what they are, scenes. It's like a Disney\r\nride, one of those dark rides in Fantasyland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except those suck and our ride rocks. It's more like Pirates of the\r\nCaribbean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have it your way. Whatever, how freaking weird is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so weird. People see stories like they see faces in clouds. Once\r\nwe gave them the ability to subtract the stuff that felt wrong and\r\nreinforce the stuff that felt right, it was only natural that they'd\r\nanthropomorphize the world into a story.\"\r\n\r\nPerry shook his head. \"You think?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have this guy, a cultural studies prof, who comes practically\r\nevery day. He's been telling me all about it. Stories are how we\r\nunderstand the world, and technology is how we choose our stories.\r\n\r\n\"Check out the Greeks. All those Greek plays, they end with the *deus\r\nex machina* -- the playwright gets tired of writing, so he trots a god\r\nout on stage to simply point a finger at the players and make it all\r\nbetter. You can't do that in a story today, but back then, they didn't\r\nhave the tools to help them observe and record the world, so as far as\r\nthey could tell, that's how stuff worked!\r\n\r\n\"Today we understand a little more about the world, so our stories are\r\nabout people figuring out what's causing their troubles and changing\r\nstuff so that those causes go away. Causal stories for a causal\r\nuniverse. Thinking about the world in terms of causes and effects\r\nmakes you seek out causes and effects -- even where there are\r\nnone. Watch how gamblers play, that weird cargo-cult feeling that the\r\nroulette wheel came up black a third time in a row so the next spin\r\nwill make it red. It's not superstition, it's kind of the *opposite*\r\n-- it's causality run amok.\"\r\n\r\n\"So this is the story that has emerged from our collective\r\nunconscious?\"\r\n\r\nLester laughed. \"That's a little pretentious, I think. It's more like\r\nthose Japanese crabs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which Japanese crabs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Weren't you there when Tjan was talking about this? Or was that in\r\nRussia? Anyway. There are these crabs in Japan, and if they have\r\nanything that looks like a face on the backs of their shells, the\r\nfishermen throw them back because it's bad luck to eat a crab with a\r\nface on its shell. So the crabs with face-like shells have more\r\nbabies. Which means that gradually, the crabs' shells get more\r\nface-like, since all non-face-like shells are eliminated from the\r\ngene-pool. This leads the fishermen to raise the bar on their\r\nselection criteria, so they will eat crabs with shells that are a\r\nlittle face-like, but not *very* face-like. So all the slightly\r\nface-like crab-shells are eliminated, leaving behind moderately\r\nface-like shells. This gets repeated over several generations, and now\r\nyou've got these crabs that have vivid faces on their shells.\r\n\r\n\"We let our riders eliminate all the non-story-like elements from the\r\nride, and so what's left behind is more and more story-like.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the plus-one/minus-one lever is too crude for this, right? We\r\nshould give them a pointer or something so they can specify individual\r\nelements they don't like.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to encourage this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you?\"\r\n\r\nLester nodded vigorously. \"Of course I do. I just thought that you'd\r\nbe a little less enthusiastic about it, you know, because so much of\r\nthe New Work stuff is being de-emphasized.\"\r\n\r\n\"You kidding? This is what the New Work was all about: group creation!\r\nI couldn't be happier about it. Seriously -- this is so much cooler\r\nthan anything that I could have built. And now with the network coming\r\nonline soon -- wow. Imagine it. It's going to be so fucking weird,\r\nbro.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen,\" Lester said. He looked at his watch and yelped. \"Shit, late\r\nfor a date! Can you get yourself home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Perry said. \"Brought my wheels. See you later -- have a good\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's amazing,\" Lester said. \"Used to weigh 900 pounds and was shut\r\nin for ten years. Man has she got an imagination on her. She can do\r\nthis thing --\"\r\n\r\nPerry put his hands over his ears. \"La la la I'm not listening to\r\nyou. TMI, Lester. Seriously. Way way TMI.\"\r\n\r\nLester shook his head. \"You are such a prude, dude.\"\r\n\r\nPerry thought about Hilda for a fleeting moment, and then\r\ngrinned. \"That's me, a total puritan. Go. Be safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Safe, sound, and slippery,\" Lester said, and got in his car.\r\n\r\nPerry looked around at the shuttered market, rooftops glinting in the\r\nrosy tropical sunset. Man he'd missed those sunsets. He snorted up\r\ndamp lungsful of the tropical air and smelled dinners cooking at the\r\nshantytown across the street. It was different and bigger and more\r\nelaborate every time he visited it, which was always less often than\r\nhe wished.\r\n\r\nThere was a good barbecue place there, Dirty Max's, just a hole in the\r\nwall with a pit out back and the friendliest people. There was always\r\na mob scene around there, locals greasy from the ribs in their hands,\r\na big bucket overflowing with discarded bones.\r\n\r\nWandering towards it, he was amazed by how much bigger it had grown\r\nsince his last visit. Most buildings had had two stories, though a few\r\nhad three. Now almost all had four, leaning drunkenly toward each\r\nother across the streets. Power cables, network cables and\r\nclotheslines gave the overhead spaces the look of a carelessly spun\r\nspider's web. The new stories were most remarkable because of what\r\nFrancis had explained to him about the way that additional stories got\r\nadded: most people rented out or sold the right to build on top of\r\ntheir buildings, and then the new upstairs neighbors in turn sold\r\n*their* rights on. Sometimes you'd get a third-storey dweller who'd\r\nwant to build atop two adjacent buildings to make an extra-wide\r\napartment for a big family, and that required negotiating with all of\r\nthe \"owners\" of each floor of both buildings.\r\n\r\nJust looking at it made his head hurt with all the tangled property\r\nand ownership relationships embodied in the high spaces. He heard the\r\neasy chatter out the open windows and music and crying babies. Kids\r\nran through the streets, laughing and chasing each other or bouncing\r\nballs or playing some kind of networked RPG with their phones that had\r\nthem peeking around corners, seeing another player and shrieking and\r\nrunning off.\r\n\r\nThe grill-woman at the barbecue joint greeted him by name and the men\r\nand women around it made space for him. It was friendly and\r\ncompanionable, and after a moment Francis wandered up with a couple of\r\nhis proteges. They carried boxes of beer.\r\n\r\n\"Hey hey,\" Francis said. \"Home again, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Home again,\" Perry said. He wiped rib-sauce off his fingers and shook\r\nFrancis's hand warmly. \"God, I've missed this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"We missed having you,\" Francis said. \"Big crowds across the way,\r\ntoo. Seems like you hit on something.\"\r\n\r\nPerry shook his head and smiled and ate his ribs. \"What's the story\r\naround here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lots and lots,\" Francis said. \"There's a whole net-community thing\r\nhappening. Lots of traffic on the AARP message-boards from other\r\npeople setting these up around the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you've hit on something, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naw. When it's railroading time, you get railroads. When it's\r\nsquatter time, you get squats. You know they want to open a 7-Eleven\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" Perry laughed and choked on ribs and then guzzled some beer to\r\nwash it all down.\r\n\r\nFrancis put a wrinkled hand over his heart. He still wore his wedding\r\nband, Perry saw, despite his wife's being gone for decades. \"I swear\r\nit. Just there.\" He pointed to one of the busier corners.\r\n\r\n\"And?\"\r\n\r\n\"We told them to fuck off,\" Francis said. \"We've got lots of\r\ncommunity-owned businesses around here that do everything a 7-Eleven\r\ncould do for us, without taking the wealth out of our community and\r\nsending it to some corporate jack-off. Some soreheads wanted to see\r\nhow much money we could get out of them, but I just kept telling them\r\n-- whatever 7-Eleven gives us, it'll only be because they think they\r\ncan get more *out of us*.' They saw reason. Besides, I'm in charge --\r\nI always win my arguments.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are the most benevolent of dictators,\" Perry said. He began to\r\nwork on another beer. Beer tasted better outside in the heat and the\r\nbarbecue smoke.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad someone thinks so,\" Francis said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\"\r\n\r\n\"The 7-Eleven thing left a lot of people pissed at me. There's plenty\r\naround here that don't remember the way it started off. To them, I'm\r\njust some alter kocker who's keeping them down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it serious?\" Perry knew that there was the potential for serious,\r\nmajor lawlessness from his little settlement. It wasn't a failing\r\ncondo complex rented out to Filipina domestics and weird entrepreneurs\r\nlike him. It was a place where the cops would love an excuse to come\r\nin with riot batons (his funny eyebrow twitched) and gas, the kind of\r\nplace where there almost certainly were a few very bad people living\r\ntheir lives. Miami had bad people, too, but the bad people in Miami\r\nweren't his problem.\r\n\r\nAnd the bad people and the potential chaos were what he loved about\r\nthe place, too. He'd grown up in the kind of place where everything\r\nwas predictable and safe and he'd hated every minute of it. The\r\nglorious chaos around him was just as he liked it. The wood-smoke\r\ncurled up his nose, fragrant and all-consuming.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anymore. I thought I'd retire and settle down and take\r\nup painting. Now I'm basically a mob boss. Not the bad kind, but\r\nstill. It's a lot of work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pimpin' ain't easy.\" Perry saw the shocked look on Francis's face and\r\nadded hastily, \"Sorry -- not calling you a pimp. It's a song lyric is\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"We got pimps here now. Whores, too. You name it, we got it. It's\r\nstill a good place to live -- better than Miami, if you ask me -- but\r\nit could go real animal. Bad, bad animal.\"\r\n\r\nHard to believe, standing there in the wood-smoke, licking his\r\nfingers, drinking his beer. His cold seemed to have been baked out by\r\nthe steamy swampy heat.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Francis, if anyone knows how to keep peace, it's you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Social workers come around, say the same thing. But there's people\r\naround here with little kids, they worry that the social workers could\r\nforce them out, take away their children.\"\r\n\r\nIt wasn't like Francis to complain like this, it wasn't in his nature,\r\nbut here it was. The strain of running things was showing on\r\nhim. Perry wondered if his own strain was showing that way. Did he\r\ncomplain more these days? Maybe he did.\r\n\r\nAn uncomfortable silence descended upon them. Perry drank his beer,\r\nmorosely. He thought of how ridiculous it was to be morose about the\r\npossibility that he was being morose, but there you had it.\r\n\r\nFinally his phone rang and saved him from further conversation. He\r\nlooked at the display and shook his head. It was Kettlewell\r\nagain. That first voicemail had made him laugh aloud, but when they\r\nhadn't called back for a couple days, he'd figured that they had just\r\nhad a little too much wine and placed the call.\r\n\r\nNow they were calling back, and it was still pretty early on the West\r\nCoast. Too early for them to have had too much wine, unless they'd\r\nreally changed.\r\n\r\n\"Perry Perry Perry!\" It was Kettlebelly. He sounded like he might be\r\ndrunk, or merely punch-drunk with excitement. Perry remembered that he\r\ngot that way sometimes.\r\n\r\n\"Kettlewell, how are you doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm here too, Perry. I cashed in my return ticket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. She too sounded punchy, like they'd been having a\r\nfit of the giggles just before calling. \"Kettlewell's family have\r\ntaken me in, wayward wanderer that I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"You two sound pretty, um, happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've been having an amazing time,\" Kettlewell said. His speakerphone\r\nmade him sound like he was at the bottom of a well. \"Mostly\r\nreminiscing about you guys. What the hell are you up to? We tried to\r\nfollow it on the net, but it's all jumbled. What's this about a\r\n*story*?\"\r\n\r\n\"Story?\"\r\n\r\n\"I keep reading about this ride of yours and its story. I couldn't\r\nmake any sense of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't read any of this, but Lester and I were talking about some\r\nstuff to do with stories tonight. I didn't know anyone else was\r\ntalking about this, though. Where'd you see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll email it to you,\" Suzanne said. \"I was going to blog it tonight\r\nanyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you two are just hanging around San Francisco giggling and walking\r\ndown memory lane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yeah! It's about time, too. We've all been separated for too\r\nlong. We want a reunion, Perry.\"\r\n\r\n\"A reunion?\"\r\n\r\n\"We want to come down for a visit and see what you're doing and hang\r\nout. You wouldn't believe how much fun we've been having, Perry,\r\nseriously.\" Kettlewell sounded like he'd been huffing nitrous or\r\nsomething. \"Have *you* been having fun?\"\r\n\r\nHe thought about the question. \"Um, kind of?\" He told them about his\r\ntravels, a quick thumbnail sketch, struggling to remember which city\r\nhe'd been to when, leaving out the crazy sex -- which came back to him\r\nin a rush, that night with Hilda in the coffin, like a warm\r\nhallucination. \"On balance, yes. It's been fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, so we want to come down and have fun with you and Lester. He's\r\nstill hanging around, right?\"\r\n\r\nLester had told him about the history he had with Suzanne, and there\r\nwas something in the way she asked after Lester that suggested to\r\nPerry that there was still something there.\r\n\r\n\"You kidding? You'd have to pry us apart with a crowbar.\"\r\n\r\n\"See, I told you so,\" Suzanne said. \"This guy thought that Lester\r\nmight have gotten bored and wandered off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never! Plus anyone who follows his message board traffic and blogs\r\nwould know that he was right here, minding the shop.\" And you're\r\nreading his blog, aren't you, Suzanne? He didn't need to say it. He\r\ncould almost hear her blush over the line.\r\n\r\n\"So how about tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"For what?\"\r\n\r\n\"For us coming to town. I'll bring the wife and kids. We'll rent out a\r\ncouple hotel rooms and spend a week there. It'll be a blast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"We could get the morning flight and be there for breakfast. You got a\r\ngood hotel? Not a coffin hotel, not with the kids.\"\r\n\r\nPerry's heart beat faster. He did miss these two, and they were so\r\npunchy, so gleeful. He'd love to see them. He muted his phone.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Francis? That guesthouse down the road, is it still running?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lulu's? Sure. They just built another storey and took over the top\r\nfloor of the place next door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfect.\" He unmuted. \"How'd you like to stay in a squatter\r\nguesthouse in the shantytown?\"\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" Kettlewell said, but Suzanne laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh hell *yes*,\" she said. \"Get that look off your face, Kettlewell,\r\nthis is an *adventure*.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd love it,\" Kettlewell said.\r\n\r\n\"Great, I'll make you a reservation. How long are you staying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Until we leave,\" Suzanne said.\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" Perry said and laughed himself. They were different people,\r\nthese two, from the people he remembered, but they were also old\r\nfriends. And they were coming to see him tomorrow. \"OK, lemme go make\r\nyour reservations.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis walked him over and the landlord fussed over the two of them\r\nlike they were visiting dignitaries. Perry looked the place over and\r\nit was completely charming. He spotted what he thought was probably a\r\nhooker and a trick taking a room for the night, but you got that at\r\nthe Hilton, too.\r\n\r\nBy the time he got home he was sure that he'd sleep like a log. He\r\ncould barely keep his eyes open on the drive. But after he climbed\r\ninto bed and closed his eyes, he found that he couldn't sleep at\r\nall. Something about being back in his own room in his own bed felt\r\nalien and exciting. He got up and paced the apartment and then Lester\r\ncame home from his date with the fatkins nympho, full of improbable\r\nstories and covered in little hickeys.\r\n\r\n\"You won't believe who's coming for a visit,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"Steve Jobs. He's come down from the lamasery and renounced\r\nBuddhism. He wants to give a free computer to every visitor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Close,\" Perry said. \"Kettlebelly and Suzanne Church. Coming\r\n*tomorrow* for a stay of unspecified duration. It's a reunion. It's a\r\n*reunion* you big sonofabitch! Woot! Woot!\" Perry did a little\r\ntwo-step. \"A reunion!\"\r\n\r\nLester looked confused for a second, and then for another second he\r\nlooked, what, upset? and then he was grinning and jumping up and down\r\nwith Perry. \"Reunion!\"\r\n\r\nHe felt like he'd barely gotten to sleep when his phone rang. The\r\nclock showed six AM, and it was Kettlebelly and Suzanne, bleary,\r\njet-lagged and grouchy from their one-hour post-flight security\r\nprocessing.\r\n\r\n\"We want breakfast,\" Suzanne said.\r\n\r\n\"We've gotta open the ride, Suzanne.\"\r\n\r\n\"At six in the morning? Come on, you've got hours yet before you have\r\nto be at work. How about you and Lester meet us at the IHOP?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Come *on*! Kettlebelly's kids are dying for something to eat and his\r\nwife looks like she's ready to eat *him*. It's been years, dude! Get\r\nyour ass in the shower and down to the International House of\r\nPancakes!\"\r\n\r\nLester didn't rouse easy, but Perry knew all the tricks for getting\r\nhis old pal out of bed, they were practically married after all.\r\n\r\nThey arrived just in time for the morning rush but Tony greeted them\r\nwith a smile and sent them straight to the front of the line. Lester\r\nordered his usual (\"Bring me three pounds of candy with a side of\r\nground animal parts and potatoes\") and they waited nervously for\r\nSuzanne and the clan Kettlewell to turn up.\r\n\r\nThey arrived in a huge bustle of taxis and luggage and two wide-eyed,\r\njet-lagged children hanging off of Kettlewell and Mrs Kettlewell, whom\r\nneither of them had ever met. She was a small, youthful woman in her\r\nmid-forties with artfully styled hair and big, abstract chunky silver\r\njewelry. Suzanne had gone all Eurochic, rail-thin and smoking, with\r\nquiet, understated dark clothes. Kettlewell had a real daddy belly on\r\nhim now, a little pot that his daughter thumped rhythmically from her\r\nperch on his hip.\r\n\r\n\"Sit, sit,\" Perry said to them, getting up to help them stack their\r\nluggage at either end of the long table down the middle of the\r\nIHOP. Big family groups with tons of luggage were par for the course\r\nin Florida, so they didn't really draw much attention beyond mild\r\nirritation from the patrons they jostled as they got everyone seated.\r\n\r\nPerry was mildly amused to see that Lester and Suzanne ended up\r\nsitting next to one another and were already chatting avidly and close\r\nup, in soft voices that they had to lean in very tight to hear.\r\n\r\nHe was next to Mrs Kettlewell, whose name, it transpired, was Eva --\r\n\"As in Extra-Vehicular Activity,\" she said, geeking out with\r\nhim. Kettlewell was in the bathroom with his daughter and son, and Mrs\r\nKettlewell -- Eva -- seemed relieved at the chance for a little adult\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\"You must be a very patient woman,\" Perry said, laughing at all the\r\nticklish noise and motion of their group.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's me all right,\" Eva said. \"Patience is my virtue. And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, patience is something I value very much in other people.\" Perry\r\nsaid. It made Eva laugh, which showed off her pretty laugh-lines and\r\ndimples. He could see how this woman and Kettlewell must complement\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nShe rocked her head from side to side and took a long swig of the\r\ncoffee that their waiter had distributed around the table, topping up\r\nfrom the carafe he'd left behind. \"Thank God for legal stimulants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Long flight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Traveling with larvae is always a challenge,\" she said. \"But they dug\r\nit hard. You should have seen them at the windows.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'd never been on a plane before?\"\r\n\r\n\"I like to go camping,\" she said with a shrug. \"Landon's always on me\r\nto take the kids to Hawaii or whatever, but I'm always like, 'Man, you\r\nspend half your fucking life in a tin can -- why do you want to start\r\nyour holidays in one? Let's go to Yosemite and get muddy.' I haven't\r\neven taken them to Disneyland!\"\r\n\r\nPerry put the back of his hand to his forehead. \"That's heresy around\r\nhere,\" he said. \"You going to take them to Disney World while you're\r\nin Florida? It's a lot bigger, you know -- and it's a different\r\ndivision. Really different feel, or so I'm told.\"\r\n\r\n\"You kidding? Perry, we came here for *your* ride. It's famous, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Net.famous, maybe. A little.\" He felt his cheeks burning. \"Well,\r\nthere will be one in your neck of the woods soon enough.\" He told her\r\nabout the Burning Man collective and the plan to build one down the\r\n101, south of San Francisco International.\r\n\r\nKettlebelly returned then with the kids, and he managed to get them\r\ninto their seats while sucking back a coffee and eating a biscuit from\r\nthe basket in the center of the table, breaking off bits to shove in\r\nthe kids' mouths whenever they protested.\r\n\r\n\"These are some way tired kids,\" he said, leaning over to give his\r\nwife a kiss. Perry thought he saw Suzanne flick a look at them then,\r\nbut it might have been his imagination. Suzanne and Lester were off in\r\ntheir own world, after all.\r\n\r\n\"The plane almost crashed,\" said the little girl next to Perry. She\r\nhad a halo of curly hair like a dandelion clock and big solemn dark\r\neyes and a big wet mouth set between apple-round cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Did it really?\" Perry said. She was seven or eight he thought, the\r\nbossy big sister who'd been giving orders to her little brother from\r\nthe moment they came through the door.\r\n\r\nShe nodded solemnly. He looked at Eva, who shrugged.\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" she said, nodding vigorously now. \"There were terrists on\r\nthe plane who wanted to blow it up, but the sky marshas stopped them.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could you tell they were 'terrists'?\"\r\n\r\nShe clicked her tongue and rolled her eyes. \"They were *whispering*,\"\r\nshe said. \"Just like on *Captain President and the Freedom Fighters*.\"\r\nHe knew something of this cartoon, mostly because of all the knock-off\r\nmerch for sale in the market stalls in front of the ride.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" he said. \"Well, I'm glad the Sky Marshas stopped them. Do you\r\nwant pancakes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want caramel apple chocolate pancakes with blueberry banana sauce,\"\r\nshe said, rolling one pudgy finger along the description in the glossy\r\nmenu, beneath an oozing food-porn photo. \"And my brother wants a\r\nchocolate milkshake and a short stack of happy face clown waffles with\r\nstrawberry sauce, but not too many because he's still a baby and can't\r\neat much.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll become as fat as your daddy if you eat like that,\" Perry\r\nsaid. Eva snorted beside him.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said. \"I'm gonna be a fatkins.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" he said. Eva shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"It's the goddamned fatkins agitprop games,\" Eva said. \"They come free\r\nwith everything now -- digital cameras, phones, even in cereal\r\nboxes. You have to eat a minimum number of calories per level or you\r\nstarve to death. This one is a champeen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm nationally ranked,\" the little girl said, not looking up from the\r\nmenu.\r\n\r\nPerry looked across the table and discovered that Suzanne had covered\r\nLester's hand with hers and that Lester was laughing along with her at\r\nsomething funny. Something about that made him a little freaked out,\r\nlike Lester was making time with his sister or their mom.\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne,\" he said. \"What's happening with you these days, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Petersburg is what's happening with me,\" she said, with a hoarse\r\nlittle chuckle. \"Petersburg is like Detroit crossed with\r\nParis. Completely decrepit and decadent. There's a serial killer who's\r\nbeen working the streets for five years there and the biggest obstacle\r\nto catching him is that the first cops on the scene let rubberneckers\r\nbribe them to take home evidence as souvenirs.\"\r\n\r\n\"No way!\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, da, big vay,\" she said, dropping into a comical Boris and Natasha\r\naccent. \"Bolshoi vay.\"\r\n\r\n\"So why are you there?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's like home for me. It's got enough of Detroit's old brutal,\r\nearthy feel, plus enough of Silicon Valley's manic hustle, it just\r\nfeels right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You going to settle in there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, put that way, no. I couldn't hack it for the long term. But at\r\nthis time in my life, it's been just right. But it's good to get back\r\nto the States, too. I'm thinking of hanging out here for a couple\r\nmonths. Russia's so cheap, I've got a ton saved up. Might as well blow\r\nit before inflation kills it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You keep your money in rubles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell no -- no one uses rubles except tourists. I'm worried about\r\nanother run of *US* inflation. I mean, have you looked around lately?\r\nYou're living in a third world country, buddy.\"\r\n\r\nA waiter came between them, handing out heaping, steaming plates of\r\nfood. Lester, who'd finished his first breakfast while they waited,\r\nhad ordered a second breakfast, which arrived along with the rest of\r\nthem. Mountains of food stacked up on the table, side-plates crowding\r\njugs of apple juice and carafes of coffee.\r\n\r\nIncredibly, the food kept coming -- multiple syrup-jugs, plates of\r\nhash-browns, baskets of biscuits and bowls of white sausage\r\ngravy. Perry hadn't paid much attention when orders were being taken,\r\nbut from the looks of things, he was eating with a bunch of IHOP\r\nvirgins, unaccustomed to the astonishing portions to be had there.\r\n\r\nHe cocked his funny eyebrow at Suzanne, who laughed. \"OK, not quite a\r\nthird-world country. But not a real industrial nation anymore,\r\neither. Maybe more like the end-days of Rome or something. Drowning in\r\nwealth and wallowing in poverty.\" She forked up a mouthful of hash\r\nbrowns and chased them with coffee. Perry attacked his own plate.\r\n\r\nKettlewell fed the kids, sneaking bites in-between, while Eva looked\r\non approvingly. \"You're a good man, Landon Kettlewell,\" she said,\r\nslicing up her steak and eggs into small, precise cubes, wielding the\r\nknife like an artist.\r\n\r\n\"You just enjoy your breakfast, my queen,\" he said, spooning oatmeal\r\nwith raisins, bananas, granola and boysenberry jam into the little\r\nboy's mouth.\r\n\r\n\"We got you presents,\" the little girl said, taking a break from\r\nshoveling banana-chocolate caramel apples into her mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" Perry raised his funny eyebrow and she giggled. He did it\r\nagain, making it writhe like a snake. She snarfed choco-banana across\r\nthe table, then scooped it up and put it back in her mouth.\r\n\r\nShe nodded vigorously. \"Dad, give them their presents!\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell said, \"Someone has to feed your brother, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it,\" she said. She forked up some of his oatmeal and\r\nattempted to get it into the little boy's face. \"Presents!\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell dug through the luggage-cluster under the table and came up\r\nwith an overstuffed diaper bag, then pawed through it for a long time,\r\nurged on by his daughter who kept chanting \"Presents! Presents!\r\nPresents!\" while attempting to feed her little brother. Eva and Lester\r\nand Suzanne took up the chant. They were drawing stares from nearby\r\ntables, but Perry didn't mind. He was laughing so hard his sides hurt.\r\n\r\nFinally Kettlewell held a paper bag aloft triumphantly, then clapped a\r\nhand over his daughter's mouth and shushed the rest.\r\n\r\n\"You guys are really hard to shop for,\" he said. \"What the hell do you\r\nget for two guys who not only have everything, but *make* everything?\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne nodded. \"Damned right. We spent a whole day looking for\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Kettlewell said. \"We figured that it should be something\r\nuseful, not decorative. You guys have decorative coming out of your\r\nasses. So that left us with tools. We wanted to find you a tool that\r\nyou didn't have, and that you would appreciate.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne picked up the story. \"I thought we should get you an antique\r\ntool, something so well-made that it was still usable. But to be\r\nuseful, it had to be something no one had improved on, and that had in\r\nfact been degraded by modern manufacturing techniques.\r\n\r\n\"At first we looked at old tape-measures, but I remembered that you\r\nguys were mostly using keychain laser range-finders these\r\ndays. Screwdrivers, pliers, and hammers were all out -- I couldn't\r\nfind a damned thing that looked any better than what you had around\r\nhere. The state of the art is genuinely progressing.\r\n\r\n\"There were a lot of nice old brass spirit-levels and hand-lathed\r\nplumb-bobs but they were more decorative than useful by a damned\r\nsight. Great old steel work-helmets looked cool, but they weighed\r\nabout a hundred times what the safety helmets around here weigh.\r\n\r\n\"We were going to give in and try to bring you guys a big goddamned\r\ntube-amp, or maybe some Inuit glass knives, but I didn't see you\r\nhaving much of a use for either.\r\n\r\n\"Which is how we came to give up on tools per se and switched over to\r\nleisure -- sports tools. There was a much richer vein. Wooden bats, oh\r\nyes, and real pigskin footballs that had nice idiosyncratic spin that\r\nyou'd have to learn to compensate for. But when we found these, we\r\nknew we'd hit pay-dirt.\"\r\n\r\nShe picked up Kettlewell's paper sack with a flourish and unzipped\r\nit. A moment later she presented them with two identical packages\r\nwrapped in coarse linen paper hand-stamped with Victorian woodcuts of\r\nsporting men swinging bats and charging the line with pigskins under\r\ntheir arms.\r\n\r\n\"Ta-dah!\"\r\n\r\nThe kids echoed it. \"These are the best presents,\" the little girl\r\nconfided in Perry as he picked delicately at the exquisite paper.\r\n\r\nThe paper gave way in folds and curls, and then he and Lester both\r\nheld their treasures aloft.\r\n\r\n\"Baseball gloves!\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"A catcher's mitt and a fielder's glove,\" Kettlewell said. \"You look\r\nat that catcher's mitt. 1910!\" It was black and bulbous, the leather\r\nsoft and yielding, with a patina of fine cracks like an old\r\npainting. It smelled like oil and leather, an old rich smell like a\r\ngentleman's club or an expensive briefcase. Perry tried it on and it\r\nmolded itself to his hand, snug and comfortable. It practically cried\r\nout to have a ball thrown at it.\r\n\r\n\"And this fielder's glove,\" Kettlewell went on, pointing at the glove\r\nLester held. It was the more traditional tan color, comically large\r\nlike the glove of a cartoon character. It too had the look of ancient,\r\nwell-loved leather, the same mysterious smell of hide and oil. Perry\r\ntouched it with a finger and it felt like a woman's cheek, smooth and\r\nsoft. \"Rawlings XPG6. The Mickey Mantle. Early 1960s -- the ultimate\r\nglove.\"\r\n\r\n\"You got the whole sales pitch, huh, darling?\" Eva said, not unkindly,\r\nbut Kettlewell flushed and glared at her for a moment.\r\n\r\nPerry broke in. \"Guys, these are -- wow. Incredible.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're better than the modern product,\" Suzanne said. \"That's the\r\npoint. You can't print these or fab these. They're wonderful because\r\nthey're so well made *and so well-used*! The only way to make a glove\r\nthis good would be to fab it and then give it to several generations\r\nof baseball players to love and use for fifty to a hundred years.\"\r\n\r\nPerry turned over the catcher's mitt. Over a hundred years old. This\r\nwasn't something to go in a glass case. Suzanne was right: this was a\r\ngreat glove because people had played with it, all the time. It needed\r\nto be played with or it would get out of practice.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we're going to have to buy a baseball,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\nThe little girl beside him started bouncing up and down.\r\n\r\n\"Show him,\" Suzanne said, and the girl dove under the table and came\r\nup with two white, fresh hard balls. Once he fitted one to the pocket\r\nof his glove, it felt so perfectly right -- like a key in a lock. This\r\npocket had held a lot of balls over the years.\r\n\r\nLester had put a ball in the pocket of his glove, too. He tossed it\r\nlightly in the air and caught it, then repeated the trick. The look of\r\nvisceral satisfaction on his face was unmistakable.\r\n\r\n\"These are *great* presents, guys,\" Perry said. \"Seriously. Well\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nThey all beamed and murmured and then the ball Lester was tossing\r\ncrashed to the table and broke a pitcher of blueberry syrup, upset a\r\ncarafe of orange juice, and rolled to a stop in the chocolate mess in\r\nfront of the little girl, who laughed and laughed and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"And *that* is why we don't play with balls indoors,\" Suzanne said,\r\nlooking as stern as she could while obviously trying very hard not to\r\nbust out laughing.\r\n\r\nThe waiters were accustomed to wiping up spills and Lester was\r\nawkwardly helpful. While they were getting everything set to rights\r\nagain, Perry looked at Eva and saw her lips tightly pursed as she\r\nconsidered her husband. He followed Kettlebelly's gaze and saw that he\r\nwas watching Suzanne (who was laughingly restraining Lester from doing\r\nany more \"cleaning\") intently. In a flash, Perry thought he had come\r\nto understanding. Oh dear, he thought.\r\n\r\nThe kids loved the shantytown. The little girl -- Ada, \"like the\r\nprogramming language,\" Eva said -- insisted on being set down so she\r\ncould tread the cracked cement walkways herself, head whipping back\r\nand forth to take the crazy-leaning buildings in, eyes following the\r\nzipping motor-bikes and bicycles as they wove in and out of the busy\r\nstreets. The shantytowners were used to tourists in their midst. A few\r\nyardies gave them the hairy eyeball, but then they saw Perry was along\r\nand they found something else to pay attention to. That made Perry\r\nfeel obscurely proud. He'd been absent for months, but even the corner\r\nboys knew who he was and didn't want to screw with him.\r\n\r\nThe guesthouse's landlady greeted them at the door, alerted to their\r\ncoming by the jungle telegraph. She shook Perry's hand warmly, gave\r\nAda a lollipop, and chucked the little boy (Pascal, \"like the\r\nprogramming language,\" said Eva, with an eye-roll) under the\r\nchin. Check-in was a lot simpler than at a coffin-hotel or a Hilton:\r\njust a brief discussion of the available rooms and a quick tour. The\r\nKettlewells opted for the lofty attic, which could fit two\r\nthree-quarter width beds and a crib, and overlooked the curving\r\nstreets from a high vantage; Suzanne took a more quotidian room just\r\nbelow, with lovely tile mosaics made from snipped-out sections of\r\nplastic fruit and smashed novelty soda bottles. (The landlady\r\nprivately assured Perry that her euphemistic \"hourly trade\" was in a\r\ndifferent part of the guesthouse altogether, with its own staircase).\r\n\r\nA few hours later, Perry was alone again, working his ticket\r\ncounter. The Kettlewells were having naps, Lester and Suzanne had gone\r\noff to see some sights, and the crowd for the ride was already large,\r\nsnaking through the market, thick with vendors and hustling kids\r\ntrying to pry the visitors loose of their bankrolls.\r\n\r\nHe felt like doing a carny barker spiel, *Step right up, step right\r\nup, this way to the great egress!* But the morning's visitors didn't\r\nseem all that frivolous -- they were serious-faced and sober.\r\n\r\n\"Everything OK?\" he asked a girl who was riding for at least the\r\nsecond time. She was a midwestern-looking giantess in her early\r\ntwenties with big white front teeth and broad shoulders, wearing a\r\nfaded Hoosiers ball-cap and a lot of coral jewelry. \"I mean, you don't\r\nlook like you're having a fun time.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the story,\" she said. \"I read about it online and I didn't\r\nreally believe it, but now I totally see it. But you made it, right?\r\nIt didn't just... *happen*, did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it just happened,\" Perry said. This girl was a little\r\nspooky-looking. He put his hand over his heart. \"On my honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't be,\" she said. \"I mean, the story is like *right\r\nthere*. Someone must have made it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe they did,\" Perry said. \"Maybe a bunch of people thought it\r\nwould be fun to make a story out of the ride and came by to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's probably it,\" the girl said. \"The other thing, that's just\r\nridiculous.\"\r\n\r\nShe was gone and on the ride before he could ask her what this meant,\r\nand the three bangbangers behind her just wanted tickets, not\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, she was back.\r\n\r\n\"I mean the message boards,\" she said. \"Don't you follow your\r\nreferers? There's a guy in Osceola who says that this is, I don't\r\nknow, like the story that's inside our collective unconsciousness.\"\r\nPerry restrained a smile at the malapropism. \"Anyway a lot of people\r\nagree. I don't think so, though. No offense, mister, but I think that\r\nthis is just a prank or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something,\" Perry said. But she rode twice more that day, and she\r\nwasn't the only one. It was a day of many repeat riders, and the\r\nmarket-stall people came by to complain that the visitors weren't\r\nbuying much besides the occasional ice-cream or pork cracklin.\r\n\r\nPerry shrugged and told them to find something that these people\r\nwanted to buy, then. One or two of the miniatures guys got gleams in\r\ntheir eyes and bought tickets for the ride (Perry charged them half\r\nprice) and Perry knew that by the time the day was out, there'd be\r\nsouvenir ride-replicas to be had.\r\n\r\nLester and Suzanne came by after lunchtime and Lester relieved him,\r\nleaving him to escort Suzanne back to the shantytown and the\r\nKettlewells.\r\n\r\n\"You two seem to be getting on well,\" Perry said, jerking his head\r\nback at Lester as they walked through the market.\r\n\r\nSuzanne looked away. \"This is amazing, Perry,\" she said, waving her\r\nhand at the market stalls, a gesture that took in the spires of the\r\nshantytown and the ride, too. \"You have done something...stupendous,\r\nyou know it? I mean, if you had a slightly different temperament, I'd\r\ncall this a cult. But it seems like you're not in charge of anything\r\n--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's for sure!\"\r\n\r\n\"-- even though you're still definitely *leading* things.\"\r\n\r\n\"No way -- I just go where I'm told. Tjan's leading.\"\r\n\r\n\"I spoke to Tjan before we came out, and he points the finger at\r\nyou. 'I'm just keeping the books and closing the contracts.' That's a\r\ndirect quote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well maybe no one's leading. Not everything needs a leader, right?\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne shook her head at him. \"There's a leader, sweetie, and it's\r\nyou. Have a look around. Last I checked, there were three more rides\r\ngoing operational this week, and five more in the next month. Just\r\nlooking at your speaking calendar gave me a headache --\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a speaking calendar?\"\r\n\r\n\"You do indeed, and it's a busy one. You knew that though, right?\"\r\n\r\nTjan sent him email all the time telling him about this group or that,\r\nwhere he was supposed to go and give a talk, but he'd never seen a\r\ncalendar. But who had time to look at the website anymore?\r\n\r\n\"I suppose. I knew I was supposed to get on a plane again in a couple\r\nweeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that's what a leader is -- someone who gets people mobilized and\r\nmoving.\"\r\n\r\n\"I met a girl in Madison, Wisconsin, you'd probably get along with.\"\r\nThinking of Hilda made him smile and feel a little horny, a little\r\nwistful. He hadn't gotten fucked in mind and body like that since his\r\ntwenties.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I'll meet her. Is she working on a local ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going to go to the other rides?\"\r\n\r\n\"I got to write about something, Perry. Otherwise my pageviews fall\r\noff and I can't pay my rent. This is a story -- a big one, and no one\r\nelse has noticed it yet. That kind of story can turn into the kind of\r\nmoney you buy a house with. I'm speaking from experience here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think?\"\r\n\r\nShe put her hand over her heart. \"I'm good at spotting these. Man,\r\nyou've got a cult on your hands here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"The story people. I've been reading the message boards and\r\nblogs. It's where I get all my best tips.\"\r\n\r\nPerry shook his head. Everyone else was more on top of this stuff than\r\nhim. He was going to have to spend less time hacking the ride and more\r\ntime reading the interweb, clearly.\r\n\r\n\"It was all Lester's idea, anyway,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe looked down with an unreadable expression. He hazarded a guess as\r\nto what that was about.\r\n\r\n\"Things are getting tight between you two, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ it doesn't show that much does it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he lied. \"I just know Lester is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's something else,\" she said.\r\n\r\nSuzanne needed some sundries, so he directed her to a little bodega in\r\nthe back room of one of the houses. He told her he'd meet her at the\r\nguesthouse and took a seat in the lobby. He was still beat from the\r\ncold and the jet-lag, the work and the sheer exhaustion.\r\n\r\nOn the road he'd had momentum dragging him from one thing to the next,\r\nflights to catch, speeches to make. Back at home, confronted with\r\nroutine, it was like his inertia was disappearing.\r\n\r\nEva Kettlewell thundered down the stairs three at a time with a sound\r\nlike a barely controlled fall, burst into the lobby and headed for the\r\ndoor, her back rigid, her arms swinging, her face a picture of rage.\r\n\r\nShe went out the door like a flash and then stood in the street for a\r\nmoment before striking out, seemingly at random.\r\n\r\nUh-oh, Perry thought.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSammy didn't dare go back to the ride for weeks after the debacle in\r\nBoston. He'd been spotted by the Chinese guy and the bummy-looking guy\r\nwho said he'd designed the ride, that much was sure. They probably\r\nsuspected him of having sabotaged the Boston ride.\r\n\r\nBut he couldn't stay away. Work was dismal. The other execs at Disney\r\nWorld were all amazingly petty, and always worse before the quarterly\r\nnumbers came out. Management liked to chase any kind of bad numbers\r\nwith a few ritual beheadings.\r\n\r\nThe new Fantasyland had been a feather in Sammy's cap that had kept\r\nhim safe from politics for a long time, but not anymore. Now it was\r\ngetting run down: cigarette burns, graffiti, and every now and again\r\nsomeone would find a couple having pervy eyeliner sex in the bushes.\r\n\r\nHe'd loved to work openings in Fantasyland's heyday. He'd stand just\r\npast the castle-gate and watch the flocking crowds of black-clad,\r\nlightly sweating, white-faced goth kids pour through it, blinking in\r\nthe unnatural light of the morning. A lot of them took drugs and\r\npartied all night and then capped it off with an early morning at\r\nFantasyland -- Disney had done focus groups, and they'd started\r\nselling the chewy things that soothed the clenched jaws brought on by\r\ndance-drugs.\r\n\r\nBut now he hated the raven-garbed customers who sallied into his park\r\nlike they owned the joint. A girl -- maybe 16 -- walked past on vinyl\r\nplatform heels with two gigantic men in their thirties behind her, led\r\non thin black leather leashes. A group of whippet-thin boys in grey\r\ndusters with impossibly high sprays of teased electric blue hair\r\nfollowed. Then a group of heavily pierced older women, their faces\r\nrattling.\r\n\r\nThen it was a river of black, kids in chains and leather, leathery\r\ngrownups who dressed like surly kids. They formed neat queues by their\r\nfavorite rides -- the haunted houses, the graveyard walk-through, the\r\ncoffin coaster, the river of blood -- and puffed cloves through\r\nsmokeless hookahs. At least he hoped it was cloves.\r\n\r\nThe castmembers in Sammy's Fantasyland were no better than the\r\nguests. They were pierced, dyed, teased, and branded to within an inch\r\nof their lives, even gothier than the goths who made the long\r\npilgrimages to ride his unwholesome rides.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it was that there weren't *enough* of them anymore. The\r\ngoth scene, which had shown every sign of surging and re-surging every\r\nfive years, seemed finally to be dying. Numbers were down. A couple of\r\ngoth-themed parks in the area had shuttered, as had the marshy one in\r\nNew Orleans (admittedly that might have been more to do with the\r\ncholera outbreak).\r\n\r\nLast month, he'd shut down the goth toddler-clothing shop and put its\r\nwares on deep online discount. All his little nieces and nephews were\r\ngetting bat-wing onesies, skull platform-booties and temporary\r\nhair-dye and tattoos for Christmas. Now he just had to get rid of the\r\nother ten million bucks' worth of merch.\r\n\r\n\"Morning, Death,\" he said. The kid's real name was Darren Weinberger,\r\nbut he insisted on being called Death Waits, which given his pudgy\r\nround cheeks and generally eager-to-please demeanor, was funny enough\r\nthat it had taken Sammy a full year to learn to control his grin when\r\nhe said it.\r\n\r\n\"Sammy! Good morning -- how're you doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"The numbers stink,\" Sammy said. \"You must have noticed.\"\r\n\r\nDeath's grin vanished. \"I noticed. Time for a new ride, maybe.\" No one\r\ncalled them \"attractions\" anymore -- all that old Orwellian\r\nDisneyspeak had been abolished. \"They love the coaster and the\r\nfree-fall. Thrill rides are always crowd-pleasers.\"\r\n\r\nDeath Waits had worked at Disney for three years now, since the age of\r\n16, and he had grown up coming to the park, one of the rare Orlando\r\nlocals. Sammy had come to rely on him for what he thought of as\r\ninsight into the \"goth street.\" He never said that aloud, because he\r\nknew how much it sounded like \"whatever you crazy kids are into these\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\nBut this wasn't helpful. \"I *know* that everyone likes thrill rides,\r\nbut how the hell can you compete with the gypsy coasters?\" They set up\r\ntheir coasters by the road and ran them until there was an injury\r\nserious enough to draw the law -- a week or two at best. You could\r\norder the DIY coaster kits from a number of suppliers across the US\r\nand Mexico, put them up with cranes and semi-skilled labor and wishful\r\nthinking, start taking tickets, and when the inevitable catastrophe\r\nensued, you could be packed and on the lam in a couple hours.\r\n\r\n\"Gypsy coasters? They suck. We've got theming. Our rides are\r\n*art*. That stuff is just *engineering*.\" Death Waits was a good kid,\r\nbut he was a serious imbiber of the kool-aid. \"Maybe try dance parties\r\nagain?\" They'd tried a string of all-night raves, but the fights,\r\ndrugs, and sex were just too much for the upper management, no matter\r\nhow much money they brought in.\r\n\r\nSammy shook his head morosely. \"I've told you that a company this size\r\ncan't afford the risks from that sort of thing.\" A few more goths\r\nstraggled in. They headed for the walk-through, which probably meant\r\nthey planned to get high or make out, something he'd given up on\r\ntrying to prevent. Anything to get the numbers up. He and the security\r\nstaff had come to an understanding on this and no one was telling his\r\nboss or his colleagues.\r\n\r\n\"I should just bulldoze the whole fucking thing and start over. What\r\ncomes after goth, anyway? Are ravers back? Hippies? Punks? Chavs?\"\r\n\r\nDeath Waits was staring at him with round eyes. \"You wouldn't really\r\n--\"\r\n\r\nHe waved at the kid. This was his whole life. \"No, Death, no. We're\r\nnot going to bulldoze this place. You've got a job for life here.\" It\r\nwas a lie of such amazing callousness that Sammy felt a twinge of\r\nremorse while saying it. Those twinges didn't come often. But Death\r\nWaits looked a lot happier once the words were out of his mouth --\r\ngoths with big candy-apple cheeks were pretty unconvincing\r\ngloom-meisters.\r\n\r\nSammy stalked back to the nearest utilidor entrance, over by what had\r\nbeen the Pinocchio Village Haus. He'd turned the redesign over to a\r\ndesigner who'd started out as a lit major and whose admiration for the\r\ndark and twisted elements of the original Pinocchio tale by Carlo\r\nCollodi shone through. Now it featured murals of donkeys being flensed\r\nby fish, hectic Pleasure Island. Hanged Pinocchio on his gibbet\r\ndangled over the condiment bar, twitching and thrashing. The smell of\r\nstale grease rose from it like a miasma, clashing with the patchouli\r\nthey pumped out from the underground misters.\r\n\r\nDown into the tunnels and then into a golf cart and out to his\r\noffice. He had time to paw desultorily at the mountain of merchandise\r\nsamples that had come in over the week since he'd last tackled it --\r\nevery plaster-skull vendor and silver cross-maker in the world saw him\r\nas a ticket to easy street. None had twigged to the fact that they\r\nwere *reducing* their goth-themed merch these days. Still, going\r\nthrough merch had been his task for three years now and it was a hard\r\nhabit to break. He liked the lick-and-stick wounds with dancing\r\nmaggots that were activated by body-heat. The skeletal bikers with\r\nflocking algorithms that led them into noisy demolition derbies were a\r\ngreat idea, too, since you'd have to buy another set after a couple\r\nhours' play.\r\n\r\nHis desk was throbbing pink, which meant that he was late for\r\nsomething. He slapped at it, read the message that came up, remembered\r\nthat there was a weekly status meeting for theme-leaders that he'd\r\nbeen specifically instructed to attend. He didn't go to these things\r\nif he could help it. The time-markers who ran Adventureland and\r\nTomorrowland and so on were all boring curatorial types who thought\r\nthat change was what you gave a sucker back from a ten at a\r\nfrozen-banana wagon.\r\n\r\nThe theme-leaders met in a sumptuous board-room that had been themed\r\nin the glory years of the unified Walt Disney Company. It had\r\nrenewable tropical hardwood panelling, a beautiful garden and a koi\r\npond, and an aviary that teemed with chirruping bright birds borrowed\r\nfrom the Animal Kingdom menagerie. The table was a slab of slate with\r\na brushed finish over its pits and shelves, the chairs were so\r\nergonomic that they had zero adjustment controls, because they knew\r\nmuch better than you ever could how to arrange themselves for your\r\nmaximum comfort.\r\n\r\nHe was the last one through the door, and they all turned to stare at\r\nhim. They all dressed for shit, in old fashioned slacks and high-tech\r\nwalking shoes, company pocket-tees or baseball jerseys. None of them\r\nhad a haircut that was worth a damn, not even the two women execs who\r\nco-ran Main Street. They dressed like the Middle Americans they\r\ncatered to, or maybe a little better.\r\n\r\nSammy had always been a sharp dresser. He liked shirts that looked\r\nlike good cotton but had a little stretch built into them so they\r\nrested tight at his chest, which was big, and tight at his waist,\r\nwhich was small. He liked jeans in whatever style jeans were being\r\nworn in Barcelona that year, which meant black jeans cut very square\r\nand wide-legged, ironed stiff without a crease. He had shades that had\r\nbeen designed to make his face look a little vulpine, a trait that\r\nhe'd always known he had. It put people on edge if you looked a little\r\nwolfy.\r\n\r\nHe stopped outside the door of the board-room and squared up his\r\nshoulders. He was the youngest person on the board, and he'd always\r\nbeen the biggest, cockiest bastard in the room. He had to remember\r\nthat if he was going to survive this next hour.\r\n\r\nHe came through the door and stopped and looked at the people around\r\nthe table and waited for everyone to notice him. They looked so\r\nmidwestern and goofy, and he gave them his wolfy smile -- hello,\r\nlittle piggies, here to blow your house down.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, kids,\" he said, and grabbed the coffee carafe and a mug off the\r\nsideboard. He filled his cup, then passed the carafe off, as though\r\nevery meeting began with the passing-around of the low-grade\r\nstimulants. He settled into his seat and looked around expectantly.\r\n\r\n\"Glad you could make it, Sammy.\" That was Wiener, who generally\r\nchaired the meetings. Theoretically, it was a rotating chairship, but\r\nthere's a certain kind of person who naturally ends up running every\r\nmeeting, and Ron Wiener was that kind of person. He co-ran\r\nTomorrowland with three faceless nonentities who had been promoted\r\nabove their competence due to his inexplicable loyalty to them, and\r\nbetween the four of them, they'd managed to keep Tomorrowland the most\r\nembarrassingly badly themed part of the park. \"We were just talking\r\nabout you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I love being the subject of conversation,\" Sammy said. He slurped\r\nloudly at his coffee.\r\n\r\n\"What we were talking about was the utilization numbers from\r\nFantasyland.\"\r\n\r\nWhich sucked, Sammy knew. They'd been in free-fall for months now, and\r\nlooking around at those cow-like midwestern faces, Sammy understood\r\nthat it was time for the knives to come out.\r\n\r\n\"They suck,\" Sammy said brightly. \"That's why we're about to change\r\nthings up.\"\r\n\r\nThat preempted them. \"Can you explain that some?\" Wiener said,\r\nclicking his pen and squaring up his notepad. These jerks and their\r\npaper-fetish.\r\n\r\nSammy did his best thinking on his feet and on the\r\nmove. Confident. Wolfy. You're better than these jerks with their pads\r\nand their corn-fed notions. He sucked in a breath and began to pace\r\nand use his hands.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to take out every under-utilized ride in the land,\r\neffective immediately. Lay off the dead-wood employees. We're going to\r\nget a couple off-the-shelf thrill rides and give them a solid\r\nworking-over for theming -- build our own ride vehicles, queue areas\r\nand enclosures, big ones, weenies that will draw your eye from outside\r\nthe main gate. But that's just a stopgap.\r\n\r\n\"Next I'm going to start focus-grouping the fatkins. They're\r\nready-made for this stuff. All about having fun. Most of those\r\nex-fatties used to pack this place when they were stuck in electric\r\nwheelchairs, but now they're too busy --\" he stopped himself from\r\nsaying \"fucking\" -- \"Having more adult fun to come back, but anyone\r\nwho can afford fatkins has discretionary income and we should have a\r\npiece of it.\r\n\r\n\"It's hard to say without research, but I'm willing to bet that these\r\nguys will respond strongly to nostalgia. I'm thinking of reinstating\r\nthe old Fantasyland dark-rides, digging parts out of storage, whatever\r\nwe haven't auctioned off on the collectibles market, anyway, and\r\ncloning the rest, but remaking them with a little, you know,\r\ndarkness. Like the Pinocchio thing, but more so. Captain Hook's grisly\r\ndeath. Tinker Bell's inherent porniness. What kind of friendship did\r\nSnow White have with the dwarfs? You see where I'm going. Ironic -- we\r\nhaven't done ironic in a long time. It's probably due for a comeback.\"\r\n\r\nThey stared at him in shocked silence.\r\n\r\n\"You say you're going to do this when?\" Wiener said. He'd want to know\r\nso he could get someone senior to intervene.\r\n\r\n\"You know, research first. We'll shut down the crap rides next week\r\nand can the dead-wood. Want to commission the research today if I\r\ncan. Start work on the filler thrill-rides next week too.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down. They continued to boggle.\r\n\r\n\"You're serious about this?\"\r\n\r\n\"About what? Getting rid of unprofitable stuff? Researching profitable\r\ndirections? Yes and yes.\"\r\n\r\nThere were other routine agenda items, which reminded Sammy of why he\r\ndidn't come to these meetings. He spent the time surfing readymade\r\ncoasters and checking the intranet for engineer availability. He was\r\njust getting into the HR records to see who he'd have to lay off when\r\nthey finally wound down and he sauntered out, giving his wolfy grin to\r\nall, with a special flash of it for Wiener.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\n\"Death, I'd like a word, please?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd be delighted.\" Death talked like someone who'd learned to talk by\r\nbeing a precocious reader. He over-pronounced his words, spoke in\r\ncomplete sentences, and paused at the commas. Sammy knew that speech\r\npattern well, since he'd worked hard to train himself out of it. It\r\nwas a geek accent, and it made you sound like a smart-ass instead of a\r\nsharp operator. You got that way if you grew up trying to talk with a\r\ngrown-up vocabulary and a child's control of your speech-muscles; you\r\nlearned to hold your chin and cheeks still while you spoke to give you\r\na little precision-boost. That was the geek accent.\r\n\r\n\"Remember what we talked about this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Building a thrill ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Sammy said. He'd forgotten that Death Waits had suggested that\r\nin the first place. Good -- that was a good spin. \"I've decided to\r\ntake your suggestion. Of course, we need to make room for it, so I'm\r\ngoing to shut down some of the crap -- you know which ones I mean.\"\r\n\r\nDeath Waits was green under his white makeup. \"You mean --\"\r\n\r\n\"All the walk-throughs. The coffin coaster, of course. The flying\r\nbats. Maybe one or two others. And I'm going to need to make some\r\nlayoffs, of course. Gotta make room.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going to lay people off? How many people? We're already barely\r\nstaffed.\" Death was the official arbiter of shift-changing,\r\nschedule-swapping and cross-scheduling. If you wanted to take an\r\nafternoon off to get your mom out of the hospital or your dad out of\r\njail, he was the one to talk to.\r\n\r\n\"That's why I'm coming to you. If I shut down six of the rides --\"\r\nDeath gasped. Fantasyland had 10 rides in total. \"Six of the\r\nrides. How many of the senior staffers can I get rid of and still have\r\nthe warm bodies to keep everything running?\" Senior people cost a\r\n*lot* more than the teenagers who came through. He could hire six\r\njuniors for what Death cost him. Frigging Florida labor laws meant\r\nthat you had to give cost-of-living raises every year, and it added\r\nup.\r\n\r\nDeath looked like he was going to cry.\r\n\r\n\"I've got my own estimates,\" Sammy said. \"But I wanted to get a\r\nreality check from you, since you're right there, on the ground. I'd\r\nhate to leave too much fat on the bone.\"\r\n\r\nHe knew what effect this would have on the kid. Death blinked back his\r\ntears, put his fist under his chin and pulled out his phone and\r\nstarted scribbling on it. He had a list of every employee in there and\r\nhe began to transfer names from it to another place.\r\n\r\n\"They'll be back, right? To operate the new rides?\"\r\n\r\n\"The ones we don't bring back, we'll get them unemployment\r\ncounseling. Enroll them in a networking club for the jobless, one of\r\nthe really good ones. We can get a group rate. A job reference from\r\nthis place goes a long way, too. They'll be OK.\"\r\n\r\nDeath looked at him, a long look. The kid wasn't stupid, Sammy\r\nknew. None of these people were stupid, not Wiener, not the kid, not\r\nthe goths who led each other around Fantasyland on leashes. Not the\r\nfatkins who'd soon pack the place. They were none of them stupid. They\r\nwere just -- soft. Unwilling to make the hard choices. Sammy was good\r\nat hard choices.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nPerry got home that night and walked in on Lester and Suzanne. They\r\nwere tangled on the living-room carpet, mostly naked, and Lester\r\nblushed right to his ass-cheeks when Perry came through the door.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, sorry!\" Lester called as he grabbed a sofa cushion and passed\r\nit to Suzanne, then got one for himself. Perry averted his eyes and\r\ntried not to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus, guys, what's wrong with the bedroom?\"\r\n\r\n\"We would've gotten there eventually,\" Lester said as he helped\r\nSuzanne to her feet. Perry pointedly turned to face the wall. \"You\r\nwere supposed to be at dinner with the gang,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"Close-up on the ride was crazy. Everything was changing and the\r\nprinters were out of goop. Lots of action on the network -- Boston and\r\nSan Francisco are introducing a lot of new items to the ride. By the\r\ntime I got to the guest-house, the Kettlewells were already putting\r\nthe kids to bed.\" He decided not to mention Eva's angry storm-out to\r\nSuzanne. No doubt she had already figured out that all was not well in\r\nthe House of Kettlewell.\r\n\r\nSuzanne ahem'd.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, sorry,\" Lester said. \"Let's talk about this later, OK? Sorry.\"\r\n\r\nThey scurried off to Lester's room and Perry whipped out a computer,\r\nput on some short humor videos in shuffle-mode, and grabbed a big tub\r\nof spare parts he kept around to fiddle with. It could be soothing to\r\ntake apart and reassemble a complex mechanism, and sometimes you got\r\nideas from it.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, he heard the shower running and then Suzanne came\r\ninto the living room.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to order some food. What do you feel like?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you get, you'll have to order it from one of the fatkins\r\nplaces. It's not practical to feed Lester any other way. Get me a\r\nsmall chicken tikka pizza.\"\r\n\r\nShe pored over the stack of menus in the kitchen. \"Does Food in Twenty\r\nMinutes really deliver in 20 minutes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Usually 15. They do most of the prep in the vans and use a lot of\r\npredictive math in their routing. There's usually a van within about\r\nten minutes of here, no matter what the traffic. They deliver to\r\ntraffic-jams, too, on scooters.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne made a face. \"I thought *Russia* was weird.\" She showed the\r\nnumber on the brochure to her phone and then started to order.\r\n\r\nLester came out a minute later, dressed to the nines as always. He was\r\nbarely capable of entering his bedroom without effecting a wardrobe\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nHe gave Perry a slightly pissed off look and Perry shrugged\r\napologetically, though he didn't feel all that bad. Lester's fault.\r\n\r\nChrist on a bike, it was weird to think of the two of them together,\r\nespecially going at it on the living room rug like a couple of horny\r\nteens. Suzanne had always been the grownup in their little family. But\r\nthat had been back when there was a big company involved. Something\r\nabout being a piece of a big company made you want to act like you'd\r\nalways figured grownups should act. Once you were a free agent, there\r\nwasn't any reason not to embrace your urges.\r\n\r\nWhen the food came, the two of them attacked it like hungry dogs. It\r\nwas clear that they'd forgotten their embarrassment and were planning\r\nanother retreat to the bedroom once they'd refueled. Perry left.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Francis.\" Francis was sitting on the second-storey balcony of\r\nhis mayoral house, surveying the electric glow of the shantytown. As\r\nusual now, he was alone, without any of his old gang of boys hanging\r\naround him. He waved an arm toward Perry and beckoned him inside,\r\nbuzzing him in with his phone.\r\n\r\nPerry tracked up the narrow stairs, wondering how Francis negotiated\r\nthem with his bad knee and his propensity to have one beer too many.\r\n\r\n\"What's the good word?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not much,\" Perry said. He helped himself to a beer. They made it\r\nin the shantytown and fortified it with fruits, like a Belgian\r\nbeer. The resulting suds were strong and sweet. This one was raspberry\r\nand it tasted a little pink, like red soda.\r\n\r\n\"Your friends aren't getting along too good, is what I hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really.\" Nothing was much of a secret in this place.\r\n\r\n\"The little woman's taken a room of her own down the road. My wife did\r\nthat to me once. Crazy broad. That's their way sometimes. Get so mad\r\nthey just need to walk away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I get that mad, too,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hell, me too, all the time. But men usually don't have the guts\r\nto pack a suitcase and light out. Women have the guts. They're nothing\r\nbut guts.\"\r\n\r\nPerry cursed. Why hadn't Kettlebelly called him? What was going on?\r\n\r\nHe called Kettlebelly.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Perry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Landon. What's up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, how are things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hear Eva took off. That sort of thing. Anything we can talk\r\nabout?\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell didn't say anything.\r\n\r\n\"Should I come over?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said. \"I'll meet you somewhere. Where?\"\r\n\r\nFrancis wordlessly passed Kettlewell a beer as he stepped out onto the\r\nterrace.\r\n\r\n\"So?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're in a motel not far from here. The kids love coffins.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis opened another beer for himself. \"Hard to imagine a kid loved\r\na coffin more than your kids loved this place this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eva's pretty steamed at me. It just hasn't been very good since I\r\nretired. I guess I'm pretty hard to live with all the time.\"\r\n\r\nPerry nodded. \"I can see that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" Kettlewell said. \"Also.\" He took a pull off his beer. \"Also\r\nI had an affair.\"\r\n\r\nBoth men sucked air between their teeth.\r\n\r\n\"With her best friend.\"\r\n\r\nPerry coughed a little.\r\n\r\n\"While Eva was pregnant.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're still breathing? Patient woman,\" Francis said.\r\n\r\n\"She's a good woman,\" Kettlewell said. \"The best. Mother of my\r\nchildren. But it made her a little crazy-jealous.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what's the plan, Kettlewell? You're a good man with a plan,\" Perry\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"I have to give her a night off to cool down and then we'll see. Never\r\nany point in doing this while she's hot. Tomorrow morning, it'll come\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Perry found himself desperately embroiled in\r\nordering more goop for the three-d printers. *Lots more*. The other\r\nrides had finally come online in the night, after interminable network\r\nscrew-ups and malfing robots and printers and scanners that wouldn't\r\ncooperate, but now there were seven rides in the network, seven rides\r\nwhose riders were rearranging, adding and subtracting, and there was\r\nreconciling to do. The printers hummed and hummed.\r\n\r\n\"The natives are restless,\" Lester said, pointing a thumb over his\r\nshoulder at the growing queue of would-be riders. \"We going to be\r\nready to open soon?\"\r\n\r\nPerry had fallen into a classic nerd trap of having almost solved a\r\nproblem and not realizing that the last three percent of the solution\r\nwould take as long as the rest of it put together. Meanwhile, the ride\r\nwas in a shambles as robots attempted to print and arrange objects to\r\nmirror those around the nation.\r\n\r\n\"Soon soon,\" Perry said. He stood up and looked around at the\r\nshambles. \"I lie. This crap won't be ready for hours yet. Sorry. Fuck\r\nit. Open up.\"\r\n\r\nLester did.\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know, but that's the deal with the ride. It's got to get in\r\nsync. You know we've been working on this for months now. It's just\r\ngrowing pains. Here, I'll give you back your money you come back\r\ntomorrow, it'll all be set to rights.\"\r\n\r\nThe angry rider was a regular, one of the people who came by every\r\nmorning to ride before work. She was gaunt and tall and geeky and\r\ntalked like an engineer, with the nerd accent.\r\n\r\n\"What kind of printer?\" Lester broke in. Perry hid his snicker with a\r\ncough. Lester would get her talking about the ins and outs of her\r\nprinter, talking shop, and before you knew it she'd be mollified.\r\n\r\nPerry sold another ticket, and another.\r\n\r\n\"Hi again!\" It was the creepy guy, the suit who'd shown up in\r\nBoston. Tjan had a crazy theory about why he'd left the Boston launch\r\nin such a hurry, but who knew?\r\n\r\n\"Hi there,\" Perry said. \"Long time no see. Back from Boston, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"For months.\" The guy was grinning and sweating and didn't look\r\ngood. He had a fresh bruise on his cheek with a couple of knuckle\r\nprints clearly visible. \"Can't wait to get back on the ride. It's been\r\ntoo long.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSammy had been through a rehab and knew how they went. You laid off a\r\nbunch of people in one fast, hard big bang. Hired some unemployment\r\ncoaches for the senior unionized employees, scheduled a couple of\r\n\"networking events\" where they could mingle with other unemployed\r\nslobs and pass around home-made business cards.\r\n\r\nYou needed a Judas goat, someone who'd talk up the rehab to the other\r\nemployees, whom you could rely on. Death Waits had been his Judas goat\r\nfor the Fantasyland goth makeover. He'd tirelessly evangelized the\r\nidea to his co-workers, had found goth tru-fans who'd blog the hell\r\nout of every inch of the rehab, had run every errand no matter how\r\nmenial.\r\n\r\nBut his passion didn't carry over to dismantling the goth rehab. Sammy\r\nshould have anticipated that, but he had totally failed to do so. He\r\nwas just so used to thinking of Death Waits as someone who was a\r\nnever-questioning slave to the park.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, cheer up! Look at how cool these thrill rides are going to\r\nbe. Those were your idea, you know. Check out the coffin-cars and the\r\nlittle photo-op at the end that photoshops all the riders into\r\nzombies. That's got to be right up your alley, right? Your friends are\r\ngoing to love this.\"\r\n\r\nDeath moped as only a goth could. He performed his duties slowly and\r\nunenthusiastically. When Sammy pinned him down with a direct question,\r\nhe let his bangs fall over his eyes, looked down at his feet, and went\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, what the hell is going on? The fences were supposed to be up\r\nthis morning!\" The plan had been to get the maintenance crews in\r\nbefore rope-drop to fence off the doomed rides so that the dismantling\r\ncould begin. But when he'd shown up at eight, there was no sign of the\r\nfences, no sign of the maintenance crews and the rides were all fully\r\nstaffed.\r\n\r\nDeath looked at his feet. Sammy bubbled with rage. If you couldn't\r\ntrust your own people, you were lost. There were already enough people\r\naround the park looking for a way to wrong-foot him.\r\n\r\n\"Death, I'm talking to you. For Christ's sake, don't be such a\r\ngoddamned baby. You shut down the goddamned rides and send those\r\nglue-sniffers home. I want a wrecking crew here by lunchtime.\"\r\n\r\nDeath Waits looked at his feet some more. His floppy black wings of\r\nhair covered his face, but from the snuffling noises, Sammy knew there\r\nwas some crying going on underneath all that hair.\r\n\r\n\"Suck it up,\" he said. \"Or go home.\"\r\n\r\nSammy turned on his heel and started for the door, and that was when\r\nDeath Waits leapt on his back, dragged him to the ground and started\r\npunching him. He wasn't much of a puncher, but he did have a lot of\r\nchunky silver skull-rings that really stung. He pasted a couple good\r\nones on Sammy before Sammy came to his senses and threw the skinny kid\r\noff of him. Strangely, Sammy's anger was dissipated by the actual,\r\nphysical violence. He had never thrown a punch in his life and he was\r\nwilling to bet the same was true of Death Waits. There was something\r\nalmost funny about an actual punch-up.\r\n\r\nDeath Waits picked himself up and looked at Sammy. The kid's eyeliner\r\nwas in smears down his cheeks and his hair was standing up on\r\nend. Sammy shook his head slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother cleaning out your locker. I'll have your things sent to\r\nyou. And don't stop on your way out of the park, either.\"\r\n\r\nHe could have called security, but that would have meant sitting there\r\nwith Death Waits until they arrived. The kid would go and he would\r\nnever come back. He was disgraced.\r\n\r\nAnd leave he did. Sammy had Death Wait's employee pass deactivated and\r\nthe contents of his locker -- patchouli-reeking black tee-shirts and\r\nblunt eyeliner pencils -- sent by last-class mail to his house. He cut\r\noff Death Waits's benefits. He had the deadwood rides shuttered and\r\ncommenced their destruction, handing over any piece recognizable as\r\ncoming from a ride to the company's auction department to list\r\nonline. Anything to add black to his bottom line.\r\n\r\nBut his cheek throbbed where Death had laid into him, and he'd lost\r\nhis fire for the new project. Were fatkins a decent-sized market\r\nsegment? He should have commissioned research on it. But he'd needed\r\nto get a plan in the can in time to mollify the executive\r\ncommittee. Plus he knew what his eyes told him every day: the park was\r\nfull of fatkins, and always had been.\r\n\r\nThe ghost of Death Waits was everywhere. Sammy had to figure out for\r\nhimself whom to fire, and how to do it. He didn't really know any of\r\nthe goth kids that worked the rides these days. Death Waits had hired\r\nand led them. There were lots of crying fits and threats, and the kids\r\nhe didn't fire acted like they were next, and if it hadn't been for\r\nthe need to keep revenue flowing, Sammy would have canned all of them.\r\n\r\nThen he caught wind of what they were all doing with their severance\r\npay: traveling south to Hollywood and riding that goddamned\r\nfrankenride in the dead Wal-Mart, trying to turn it into goth\r\nparadise. Judging from the message-boards he surfed, the whole thing\r\nhad been Death Waits's idea. Goddamn it.\r\n\r\nIt was Boston all over again. He'd pulled the plug and the machine\r\nkept on moving. The hoardings went up and the rides came down, but all\r\nhis former employees and their weird eyeliner pervert pals all went\r\nsomewhere else and partied on just the same. His attendance numbers\r\nwere way down, and the photobloggers posting shots of black clouds of\r\ngoths at the frankenride made it clear where they'd all gone.\r\n\r\n*Fine*, he thought, *fine. Let's go have a look.*\r\n\r\nThe guy with the funny eyebrow made him immediately, but didn't seem\r\nto be suspicious. Maybe they never figured out what he'd done in\r\nBoston. The goth kids were busy in the market stalls or hanging around\r\nsmoking clove and patchouli hookahs and they ignored him as a square\r\nand beneath their notice.\r\n\r\nThe ride had changed a great deal since his last fated visit. He'd\r\nheard about The Story, of course -- the dark-ride press had reported\r\non it in an editorial that week. But now The Story -- which, as he\r\ncould perceive it, was an orderly progression of what seemed to be\r\nsomeone's life unfolding from childhood naivete to adolescent\r\nexuberance to adult cynicism to a nostalgic, elderly delight -- was\r\naugmented by familiar accoutrements.\r\n\r\nThere was a robot zombie-head from one of the rides he'd torn down\r\nyesterday. And here was half the sign from the coffin coaster. A\r\nbat-wing bush from the hedge-maze. The little bastards had stolen the\r\ndeconstructed ride-debris and brought it here.\r\n\r\nBy the time he got off the ride, he was grinning ferociously. By\r\ntomorrow there'd be copies of all that trademarked ride-stuff rolling\r\noff the printers in ten cities around the United States. That was a\r\nmajor bit of illegal activity, and he knew where he could find some\r\nhungry attack-lawyers who'd love to argue about it. He jumped on the\r\nride again and got his camera configured for low-light shooting.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nEva showed up on Perry's doorstep that night after dinner. Lester and\r\nSuzanne had gone off to the beach and Perry was alone, updating his\r\ninventory of tchotchkes with a camera and an old computer, getting\r\neverything stickered with RFIDs.\r\n\r\nShe had the kids in tow. Ada spotted the two old, lovely baseball\r\nmitts on the crowded coffee table and made a bee-line for them,\r\nputting one over each hand and walking around smacking them together\r\nto hear the leathery sound, snooping in drawers and peering at the\r\nbusiness-end of an arc-welder that Perry hastily snapped up and put on\r\na high shelf, which winked once to let him know that it had tracked\r\nthe movement and noted the location of the tool.\r\n\r\nThe little boy, Pascal, rode on his mother's hip. Eva had clearly had\r\na bit of a cry, but had gotten over it. Now she was determined, with\r\nher jaw thrust out and her chin up-tilted.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to do about him. He's been driving me crazy since\r\nhe retired. You know he had an affair?\"\r\n\r\n\"He told me.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. \"He tells *everyone*. He's boasting, you know?\r\nWhatever. I know why he did it. Mid-life crisis. But before that, it\r\nwas early-adulthood crisis. And adolescent crisis. That guy doesn't\r\nknow what to do with himself. He's a good man, but he's out of his\r\nfucking mind if he's not juggling a hundred balls.\"\r\n\r\nPerry tried out a noncommittal shrug.\r\n\r\n\"You're his buddy, I know. But you have to see that it's true, right?\r\nI love him, I really do, but he's got a self-destructive streak a mile\r\nwide. It doesn't matter how much he loves me or the kids, if he's not\r\ntorturing himself with work, he's got to come up with something else\r\nto screw up his life. I thought that we were going to spend the next\r\ntwenty years raising the kids, doing volunteer work, and\r\ntraveling. Not much chance of that though. You saw how he was looking\r\nat Suzanne.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think he and Suzanne --\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I asked him and he said no. Then I talked to *her* and she told\r\nme that she wouldn't ever let something like that happen. Her I\r\nbelieve.\" She sat down and dandled the little boy until he gurgled\r\ncontentedly. Perry heard Ada going crazy in the kitchen with a\r\nmechanical sphincter he'd been building. \"Rides are a lot of fun,\r\nPerry. Your ride, it's amazing. But I don't want to ride a ride for\r\nthe rest of my life, and Landon is a ride that doesn't stop. You can't\r\nget off.\"\r\n\r\nPerry was at a loss. \"I've never had a relationship that lasted more\r\nthan six months, Eva. I've got no business giving you advice on this\r\nstuff. Kettlewell is pretty amazing, though. It sounds like you've got\r\nhim pretty wired, right? You know that if he's busy, he's happy, and\r\nwhen he's slack, he's miserable. Sounds like if you keep him busy,\r\nhe'll be the kind of guy you want him to be, even if you won't have\r\nmuch time to play with him.\"\r\n\r\nShe unholstered a tit and stuck it in the boy's mouth and Perry looked\r\nat the carpet. She laughed. \"You are such a geek,\" she said. \"OK,\r\nfine. I hear what you're saying. So how do I get him busy again? Can\r\nyou use him around here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here?\" Perry thought about it. \"I don't think we need much empire\r\nbuilding around here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you'd say that. Perry, what the hell am I going to do?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a tremendous crash from the kitchen, a shriek of surprise,\r\nthen a small \"oops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ada!\" Eva called. \"What now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was playing ball in the house,\" Ada said in the same small\r\nvoice. \"Even though you have told me not to. And I broke something. I\r\nshould have listened to you.\"\r\n\r\nEva shook her head. \"Plays me like a goddamned cello,\" she said. \"I'm\r\nsorry, Perry. We'll pay for whatever it was.\"\r\n\r\nHe patted her arm. \"You forget who you're talking to. I love fixing\r\nstuff. Don't sweat it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever -- I'll buy you one and you can use it for parts. Ada! What\r\ndid you break, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Made of seashells, by the toaster. It's twitching.\"\r\n\r\n\"Toast-making seashell robot,\" Perry said. \"No sweat -- it was due for\r\nan overhaul, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ,\" she said. \"Toast-making *seashell* robot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kettlewell is why we gave up making that kind of thing,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How penitent was he?\"\r\n\r\nHe thought back to Kettlewell's long puss on Francis's terrace. \"Yeah,\r\npretty penitent. He's pretty worried, I'd say.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"All right then. Maybe he's learned a lesson. Ada! Stop\r\nbreaking things and get your shoes back on!\"\r\n\r\n\"We going back to Daddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" Ada said.\r\n\r\nThey were barely out the door when Suzanne and Lester came in. They\r\nnodded at Perry and disappeared into the bedroom. Ten minutes later,\r\nSuzanne stomped out again. She barely looked at Perry as she\r\ndisappeared into the corridor, slamming the door behind her.\r\n\r\nPerry waited five minutes to see if Lester would come out on his\r\nown. This happened sometimes with the fatkins girls; love among the\r\nfatkins was stormy and unpredictable and Lester seemed to like\r\nbragging about the melt-downs they experienced, each one an oddity of\r\nsybaritic fatkins culture to boast about.\r\n\r\nBut Lester didn't come out this time. Perry thought about calling him\r\nor sending him an email. Finally, Perry went and knocked at his door.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, go back to the living room, I'll come out, I'll come out.\"\r\n\r\nPerry went back and moused desultorily at some ride-fan blogs for a\r\nwhile, listening for Lester's door opening. Finally, out he came,\r\nlong-faced and puffy-eyed.\r\n\r\nPerry shook his head. Was everyone miserable tonight?\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Lester,\" he said. \"Something on your mind?\"\r\n\r\nHe barked a humorless laugh. \"With her, I'm still fat.\"\r\n\r\nPerry nodded as though he understood, though he didn't.\r\n\r\n\"Since fatkins, I've felt like, I don't know, a real person. When I\r\nwas big, I was invisible and totally asexual. I didn't think about\r\nhaving sex with anyone and no one ever thought about having sex with\r\nme. When I felt something for a woman, it was more like a big,\r\nromantic love, like I was a beast and she was a beauty and we could\r\nenjoy some kind of chaste, spiritual love.\r\n\r\n\"Fatkins made me...whole. A whole person, with a life below my belt as\r\nwell as above my neck. I know it looks gross and desperate to you, but\r\nto me it's a celebration. Every time I get together with a fatkins\r\ngirl and we're, you know, partying -- for both of us it becomes\r\nsomething really intimate. A denial of pain. A fuck you to the\r\nuniverse that made us so gross and untouchable.\"\r\n\r\n\"And with her, you're still fat, huh?\"\r\n\r\nLester winced. \"Yeah, it's my problem. I guess I really resent her for\r\nnot wanting me when I was big, though I totally get why she wouldn't\r\nhave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you're angry that she wants you now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh.\" Lester looked at his hands, which he was dry-washing in his\r\nlap. \"OK, maybe. Why should she want me now? I'm the same person,\r\nafter all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except that you're whole now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Urk.\" Lester started pacing. \"Who broke the toast-robot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kettlewell's daughter, Ada. Eva was over with the kids. She moved out\r\non Kettlebelly.\" He thought about whether he should tell Lester. What\r\nthe hell. \"She thinks he's in love with Suzanne.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus,\" Lester said. \"Maybe we should swap. I'll take Eva and he can\r\ntake Suzanne.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're such a pig,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"You know us fatkins -- fuck, food and folly.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what's going on with you and Suzanne now?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's gone away until I can get naked around her without either\r\nbursting into tears or making sarcastic remarks.\"\r\n\r\nJesus. Crying. Perry couldn't remember when he'd ever seen Lester\r\ncry. It was waterworks city these days around here.\r\n\r\n\"Ah.\" Perry just wanted this day to be over. He missed Hilda, though\r\nhe barely knew her. It would have been nice to have someone here at\r\nhome with him, someone he could cuddle up to in bed and talk this all\r\nout with. Maybe he should call Tjan. He hit the button on his computer\r\nthat made the TV blink the time in Morse code. It was 1AM. He'd have\r\nto be up in six hours to get the ride up and running. Screw all this,\r\nhe was going to bed. He hadn't even gotten a single email from Hilda\r\nsince he'd left Madison. Not that he'd sent one to her, of course.\r\n\r\nLester was still snoring when Perry slipped out of the condo, a bulb\r\nof juice and a microwavable venison and quail-egg breakfast burrito\r\nunder his arm. He had a little glove-box microwave and by the time he\r\nhit his first red light, the burrito was nuclear-hot and ready to\r\neat. He gobbled it one-handed while he made his way to the ride.\r\n\r\nThere were two cop cars at the end of the driveway leading to the\r\nparking lot. Broward County sheriff's deputy black-and-whites, parked\r\nhorizontally to blockade the drive.\r\n\r\nPerry pulled over and got out of his car slowly, keeping his hands in\r\nplain sight. The doors of the cruisers opened, too. The deputies\r\nalready had their mirrorshades on, though the sun was still rising,\r\nand they set down their coffees on the hood of the cars.\r\n\r\n\"This yours?\" A deputy said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder at\r\nthe flea market and the ride.\r\n\r\nPerry knew better than to answer any questions. \"Can I help you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're shutting you down, buddy, sorry.\" The cop was young, Latina and\r\nfemale, her partner was older, white and male, with the ruddy\r\ncomplexion that Perry associated with old time Florida cops.\r\n\r\n\"What's the charge?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no charge,\" the male cop said. He sounded like he was angry\r\nalready and anything Perry said would just make him angrier. \"We\r\ncharge you if we're going to arrest you. We're enforcing an\r\ninjunction. Now, if you try to get past us, we'll come up with a\r\ncharge and *then* we'll arrest you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I see the injunction?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, you can go to the courthouse and see the injunction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you supposed to have a copy of it to show to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I?\" The cop's grin was mean and impatient.\r\n\r\n\"Can I go and get some stuff from my office?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you want to get arrested you can.\" He pulled a dyspeptic face and\r\ndrank some coffee, then got back into his cruiser.\r\n\r\nThe other cop had the grace to look faintly embarrassed at her asshole\r\npartner, but then she, too, got back in her car.\r\n\r\nPerry thought furiously about this. The cop was clearly itching to\r\nbust his ass. Maybe he hated the ride, or this duty, or maybe he hated\r\nPerry -- maybe he was one of the cops who had raided the shantytown\r\nall those years before. Perry had taken a pretty big settlement off\r\nthe county over the shot in his head, and it was a sure bet that a lot\r\nof cops had suffered for it and now harbored some enmity for him.\r\n\r\nAs bad as this was, it was about to get worse. The goth kids who'd\r\nbeen hanging around in droves lately -- they didn't seem like the sort\r\nwith a lot of good instincts when it came to dealing with authority\r\nfigures. Then there were the flea-market stall owners, who'd be coming\r\nover the road to open their shops in an hour or so. This could get\r\nreally goddamned ugly.\r\n\r\nHe needed a lawyer, and someone to front for him with the lawyer. He\r\ncould call Tjan -- he would call him, in fact, but not just yet. There\r\nwere limits to what Tjan could do from Boston, after all.\r\n\r\nHe got back in his car and peeled across the road to the shantytown\r\nand the guesthouse.\r\n\r\n\"Kettlewell!\" He thumped the door. \"Come on, Landon, it's me,\r\nPerry. It's an emergency.\"\r\n\r\nHe heard Eva curse, then heard movement. \"Whazzit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, man, I wouldn't have woken you but it's a real emergency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Cops. They've shut down the ride.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell opened the door a crack and stared at him with a\r\nred-rimmed, hung-over eye. \"Cops shut down the ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, they say there's an injunction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gimme a sec, gotta put some pants on.\" He closed the door. As Perry\r\nlistened to the sounds of him getting dressed, he reflected that he'd\r\ndone Eva the favor she'd been seeking: he'd found something to keep\r\nKettlewell busy.\r\n\r\nKettlewell quizzed him intensely as they drove back across the road to\r\nthe police-cars. He called Tjan and got voicemail, left a brief\r\nmessage, then got out of the car and stood still outside it, waving at\r\nthe cop-cars.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\nThe male cop looked even more dyspeptic.\r\n\r\n\"Hi there! I wondered if I could get you to explain what's going on\r\nhere so we can open up shop again?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've shut you down to enforce an injunction.\"\r\n\r\n\"What injunction is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"A court injunction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which court?\"\r\n\r\nThe cop looked really angry for a second, then he got back in his car\r\nand fished around. \"Broward County.\" He sounded aggrieved.\r\n\r\n\"Is that the injunction there?\" Kettlewell said.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the cop said, too quickly. They both knew he was lying, jerking\r\nthem around.\r\n\r\n\"Can I see it? Does it have information about who to talk to to get\r\nthe injunction lifted?\" Kettlewell's tone was even, pleasant and very\r\nadult. The voice of someone used to being obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to go to the courthouse. They open in a couple hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd really like to see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh for chrissakes,\" the female cop said. \"Just show it to them,\r\nTom. God.\" She spat on the ground. Her partner gave her a look, then\r\nhanded the paper over to Kettlewell, who pored over it intently. Perry\r\nshoulder surfed him and gathered that they were being shut down for\r\ninfringing Disney Parks Company trademarks. That was weird. You could\r\nhardly go ten feet in Florida without tripping over a bootleg Mickey,\r\nso why should the market-stalls' Mickey designs trigger legal action?\r\n\r\n\"All right, then,\" Kettlewell said. \"Let's make some phone calls.\"\r\n\r\nThey got in the car and drove across the road to the shantytown. There\r\nwas a tea-house that opened early and they commandeered its window\r\ntable and spread out their things. Perry called Lester and woke him\r\nup. It took two or three tries to get his head around it -- Lester\r\ncouldn't figure out why they'd shut down the market-stalls, but once\r\nhe got that the ride was down too, he woke up fast and promised to\r\nmeet them.\r\n\r\nKettlewell's conversation with Tjan was a lot more heated. Perry tried\r\nto eavesdrop but couldn't make any sense of it.\r\n\r\n\"All the rides are down,\" he said once he'd dropped the phone to\r\nbounce a couple times on the tabletop, making the coffees\r\nshiver. \"Every one of them was shut down by the cops this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're shitting me. But they don't all sell the same stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were shut down because of Disney trademarks in the ride itself,\r\nor so it seems. Now, what are we going to do? Tjan's hired a lawyer\r\nfor the Boston group and we can hire one for here, but I don't think\r\nwe're going to be able to hire fixers everywhere that there's a\r\nride. That's going to be really expensive. Disney's filed all the\r\ninjunctions at the state level -- they have an industry association\r\nthey work through that has cooperating attorneys in every city in the\r\ncountry, so it was easy for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy crap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. Who did you piss off, Perry?\"\r\n\r\nDamned if he knew. He literally couldn't think of a single person\r\nwho'd want to do this -- someone had convinced the Disney company to\r\nclobber him like Godzilla going after Tokyo. It just didn't make any\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n\"So what do we do?\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell looked at him. \"I have no clue, Perry. You aren't a\r\ncompany. You aren't a network of companies. You aren't an industry\r\nassociation. No one can speak for you. You can't lobby or even field a\r\nspokesman. I mean, none of that stuff works for you -- and that's the\r\nonly way I know to fight back in court.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought we were immune to this stuff. If there's no one to sue, how\r\ncan they sue us?\"\r\n\r\n\"If there's no one to sue, there's no one to show up in court and\r\nobject, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think we can incorporate you in time to make a difference,\"\r\nKettlewell said. \"So we need to think of something else.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne slid into the booth beside them. Her hair was tied back and\r\nher makeup was spare and severe. She had on European-cut trousers,\r\nhigh like a bolero-dancer's, and a loose, flowing white cotton\r\nover-shirt on top of a luminescent pink tank. Perry couldn't tell\r\nwhether it was formal or informal, but it looked good and a little\r\nintimidatingly foreign. She didn't meet Perry's eye.\r\n\r\n\"Brief me,\" she said. She held out her phone and put it in record\r\nmode.\r\n\r\nKettlewell ran it down quickly and she nodded, jotting notes.\r\n\r\n\"So what happens next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much we can do,\" Kettlewell said.\r\n\r\n\"The riders will be along shortly. Oh, and the merchants.\" Perry still\r\ncouldn't catch her eye.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go take some pictures,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\nShe mugged for him. \"Sweetie, I take pictures of the mafiyeh.\" Then it\r\nwas all right between them again, somehow.\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" Kettlewell said. \"How's our time looking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Got thirty minutes until the first of the merchants show up. An hour\r\nuntil the riders start turning up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't have a lawyer, do you?\"\r\n\r\nPerry quirked his funny eyebrow.\r\n\r\n\"Stupid question. OK. Right, I'll make some more calls. Let's get some\r\npeople out of bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I do?\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell looked at him. \"Huh. Um. This is really my beat now. I\r\nsuppose you could go keep Suzanne company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gee, thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something wrong with Suzanne?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing's wrong with Suzanne,\" he said. \"OK, off I go.\"\r\n\r\nHe set off on foot. The shantytown had woken up now, people getting\r\nready for the hike to the early busses into places where the few\r\nremaining jobs were.\r\n\r\nHe took his phone out and tossed it from hand to hand. Then he called\r\nthe number that he'd programmed in all those days ago in Madison but\r\nhad never bothered to call. He forgot until the ringing started that\r\nit was another time-zone there -- an hour or two earlier. But when\r\nHilda answered, she sounded wide awake.\r\n\r\n\"Nice of you to call,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Nice of you to answer.\" Her voice sent a thrill up his spine.\r\n\r\n\"We've got cops outside of the ride here,\" she said. \"We've only been\r\nlive for a week, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're at every ride,\" he said. \"They shut us down too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what are you going to do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What am *I* going to do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, this is your thing, Perry. We woke up and discovered the cops\r\nthis morning and the first thing everyone did was wonder when you'd\r\ncall with the plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're kidding. What do I know about cops?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do any of us know about cops? All we know is we built this thing\r\nafter you came and talked to us about it and now it's been shut down,\r\nso we're waiting for you to tell us what to do next.\"\r\n\r\nHe groaned and sat down on a curb. \"Oh, crap.\"\r\n\r\nThen she sighed heavily at the other end. \"OK, Perry, you need to pull\r\nit together. We need you now. We need something that explains what's\r\ngoing on, what to do next, and how to do it. There's a lot of energy\r\nout here, a lot of people ready to fight. Just point us in the right\r\ndirection.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a guy who's trying to figure that out right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfect. Now you need to set up a conference call with every ride\r\noperator so we can talk this over. Get online and post a time and an\r\naddress. I'll chat it up and make some calls. You make some calls\r\ntoo. Everyone likes to hear from you. They like to know you're on\r\ntheir side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" he said, getting back to his feet, turning around to get his\r\ncomputer out of his trunk. \"Right. That's totally the right thing to\r\ndo. I'm on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good man,\" she said.\r\n\r\nA little pause stretched between them. \"So,\" he said. \"How you doing,\r\napart from all this?\"\r\n\r\nHer laugh was merry. \"I thought you'd never ask. I'm looking forward\r\nto your next visit, is how I'm doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course really.\"\r\n\r\n\"You sounded a little pissed at me there is all.\" He sounded like a\r\nlovesick teenager. \"I mean --\" He broke off.\r\n\r\n\"Your ass needed kicking, was all.\" Pause. \"I'm not pissed at you,\r\nthough. When are you coming for a visit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Got me,\" he said. \"I guess I should, right?\" He really sounded like a\r\nteenager.\r\n\r\n\"You need to visit all the sites, check in on how we're doing.\"\r\nPause. \"Plus you should come hang out with me some.\"\r\n\r\nHe almost pointed out all her warnings about only having a one-night\r\nstand and not missing the people he was away from and so forth, but\r\nstayed his tongue. The fact that she wanted him to come for a visit\r\nwas overshadowing everything, even the looming crisis with the cops.\r\n\r\n\"It's a deal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bye.\"\r\n\r\nHe almost said, \"You hang up first,\" but that would have been too\r\nmuch. Instead he just kept the phone at his ear until he heard her\r\nclick.\r\n\r\nSuzanne was pointing and shooting like mad. Perry sat down on the\r\ncracked pavement beside her and unfolded his computer and started\r\nsending out emails, setting up a conference-channel. He gave Suzanne a\r\nshort version of his talk with Hilda, being careful not to give a hint\r\nof his feelings for her.\r\n\r\n\"She sounds like a sensible girl,\" Suzanne said. \"You should go and\r\npay her another visit.\"\r\n\r\nHe blushed and she socked him in the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Take your call,\" she said. The cops were giving them the hairy\r\neyeball, and Perry screwed in his headset.\r\n\r\nThe conference channel was filling up. Perry checked off names as reps\r\nfrom all the rides came online. There was a lot of tight, tense\r\nchatter, jokes about the fuzz.\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" Perry said. \"Let's get it started. There's cops blockading every\r\nride, right? Use the poll please.\" He posted a poll to the conference\r\npage and it quickly got to 100 percent green. \"So I just found the\r\ncops outside of mine, too, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I've\r\ngot some dough for a lawyer, but I can't afford lawyers for\r\neveryone. To make that work, we'd have to fly attorneys to every city\r\nwith a ride in it, and that's not practical as I'm sure you can tell.\"\r\n\r\nA half-dozen flags went up in the conference page. \"I need someone to\r\nplay moderator, 'cause I can't talk and mod at the same time. How\r\nabout you, Hilda?\"\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" she said. \"I'm Hilda Hammersen, from the Madison group. Post\r\none-line summaries of your points and I'll set a speaker order.\"\r\n\r\nThe conference page filled up. There was the official back channel at\r\nthe bottom where the text was spilling by too fast for Perry to parse,\r\nand he knew that there were lots of unofficial back-channels in use,\r\ntoo. He covered the mic and sighed. He had nothing to say to these\r\npeople. He didn't have any answers.\r\n\r\n\"Right. So who knows what we should do?\" The back-channel went\r\ncrazy. Hilda started green-lighting speakers with their flags up.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you asking us, Perry? You've got to run this.\" The voice was\r\npetulant and Perry saw that it was one of the Boston crew, which made\r\nhim wonder what Tjan was going to do when he discovered that Perry was\r\ndoing this.\r\n\r\nThe page pinkened and then sank into red. The other people on the call\r\nclearly thought this was BS, which was a relief to Perry. Hilda cued\r\nup the next speaker.\r\n\r\n\"We could set up information pickets at the gates to each ride hitting\r\npeople up for donations for our legal defense -- get the press to\r\ncover it and maybe we could bring in enough to fight all the\r\ninjunctions.\"\r\n\r\nThe pink lightened a little, went back to neutral white, turned a\r\nlittle green. Perry slowed down the back-channel a little and skimmed\r\nit:\r\n\r\n:: No way could we bring in enough, that's like 30 grand each I get a\r\ncouple hundred people here in the morning and that would mean a\r\nhundred and fifty bucks each\r\n\r\n:: No no it's totally do-able we can raise that easy just set up some\r\npaypals and publicize the shit out of it\r\n\r\nThe next speaker was talking. \"What if we got the maintenance bots to\r\nbreak open the doors and carry the ride outside where everyone can see\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nBright red. Dumb idea.\r\n\r\nPerry broke in. \"I'm worried that when people show up it'll provoke\r\nsome kind of confrontation with the law. It could get ugly here. How\r\ncan we keep that cooled out?\"\r\n\r\nGreen.\r\n\r\n\"That's totally got to be our top priority,\" Hilda said.\r\n\r\nNext speaker. \"OK, so the best way to keep people calm is to tell them\r\nthat there's an alternative to going nuts, which maybe could be\r\nraising money for a legal defense.\"\r\n\r\nGreen-ish. \"What about finding pro-bono lawyers? What about the ACLU\r\nor EFF?\"\r\n\r\nGreener.\r\n\r\nThe back-channel filled up with URLs and phone numbers and email\r\naddresses.\r\n\r\n\"OK, time's running out here,\" Perry said. \"You guys need to organize\r\na call-around to those orgs and see if they'll help us out. Pass the\r\nhat at your rides, try to find lawyers. Everyone keep reporting in all\r\nday -- especially if you get a win anywhere. I'm going to go take care\r\nof things here.\"\r\n\r\nHilda IMed him -- \"Good luck, Perry. You'll kick ass.\"\r\n\r\nPerry started to IM back, but a shadow fell across his screen. It was\r\nJason, who ran the contact-lens stall. He was staring at the two\r\ncop-cars quizzically, looking groggy but growing alarmed.\r\n\r\nPerry closed his lid and got to his feet. \"Morning, Jason.\" Behind\r\nJason were five or six other vendors. The sellers who lived in the\r\nshantytown and could therefore walk to work were always first in. Soon\r\nthe commuters would start arriving in their beater cars.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Perry,\" Jason said. He was chewing on an unlit cigarette, a\r\ndisgusting habit that was only marginally less gross than smoking\r\nthem. He'd tried toothpicks, but nothing would satisfy his oral\r\ncravings like a filter-tip. At least he didn't light them. \"What's\r\nup?\"\r\n\r\nPerry told him what he knew, which wasn't much. Jason listened\r\ncarefully, as did the other vendors who arrived. \"They're fucking with\r\nyou, man. The cops, Disney, all of them. Just fucking with you. You go\r\nahead and hire a lawyer to go to the court for you and see how far it\r\ngets you. They're not playing by any rules, they're not interested in\r\nthe law you broke or whatever. They just want to fuck with you.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne appeared over Perry's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Suzanne Church, Jason. I'm a reporter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, I know you. You were there when they burned down the old\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was me. I think you're right. They're fucking with you guys. I\r\nwant to report on that because it might be that exposing it makes it\r\nharder to continue. Can I record what you guys say and do?\"\r\n\r\nJason grinned and slid the soggy cig from one corner of his mouth to\r\nthe other and back again. \"Sure, that's cool with me.\" He turned to\r\nthe other sellers: \"You guys don't mind, do you?\" They joked and\r\nlaughed and said no. Perry let out a breath slowly. These guys didn't\r\nwant a confrontation with the cops -- they knew better than him that\r\nthey couldn't win that one.\r\n\r\nSuzanne started interviewing them. The cops got out of their cars and\r\nstared at them. The woman cop had her mirrorshades on now, and so the\r\nboth of them looked hard and eyeless. Perry looked away quickly.\r\n\r\nThe vendors with cars were pulling them around to the roadside leading\r\nup to the ride, unpacking merchandise and setting it out on their\r\nhoods. Vendors from the shantytown headed home and came back with\r\nfolding tables and blankets. These guys were business-people. They\r\nweren't going to let the law stand in the way of putting food on the\r\ntable for their families.\r\n\r\nThe cops got back into their cars. Kettlewell worked his way\r\ncautiously across the freeway, climbing laboriously over the\r\nmedian. He had changed into a smart blazer and slacks, with a crisp\r\nwhite shirt that hid his incipient belly. He looked like the\r\nKettlewell of old, the kind of man used to giving orders and getting\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, man,\" Perry said. Kettlewell's easy smile was reassuring.\r\n\r\n\"Perry,\" he said, throwing an arm around his shoulders and leading him\r\naway. \"Come here and talk with me.\"\r\n\r\nThey stood in the lee of one of the sickly palms that stood by the\r\nroadside. The day was coming up hot and Perry's t-shirt stuck to his\r\nchest, though Kettlewell seemed dry and in control.\r\n\r\n\"What's going on, Perry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we did a phoner this morning with all the ride\r\noperators. They're going to work on raising money for the defense and\r\ngetting pro-bono lawyers from the EFF or the ACLU or something.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell did a double-take. \"Wait, what? They're going to ask the\r\nACLU? They can't be trusted, Perry. They're *impact litigators* --\r\nthey'll take cases to make a point, even when it's not in their\r\nclients' best interests.\"\r\n\r\n\"What could be more in our interests than getting lawyers to fight\r\nthese bogus injunctions?\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell blew out a long breath. \"OK, table it. Table it. Here's\r\nwhat I've been pulling together: we've got a shitkicking corporate\r\nfirm that used to handle the Kodacell business that's sending out a\r\npartner to go to the Broward County court this morning to get the\r\ninjunction lifted. They're doing this as a freebie, but I told them\r\nthat they could handle the business if we put together all the rides\r\ninto one entity.\"\r\n\r\nNow it was Perry's turn to boggle. \"What kind of entity?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have to incorporate them all, get them all under one umbrella so\r\nthat we can defend them all in one go. Otherwise there's no way we're\r\ngoing to be able to save them. Without a corporate entity, it's like\r\ntrying to herd cats. Besides, you need some kind of structure, a\r\nformal constitution or something for this thing. You've got a network\r\nprotocol, and that's it. There's money at stake here -- potentially\r\nsome big money -- and you can't run something like that on a\r\nhandshake. It's too vulnerable. You'll get embezzled or sued into\r\noblivion before you even have a chance to grow. So I've started the\r\npaperwork to get everything under one banner.\"\r\n\r\nPerry counted to ten, backwards. \"Landon, I'm really thankful that\r\nyou're helping us out here. You're probably going to save our\r\nasses. But you can't put everything under one banner -- you can't just\r\ndeclare to these people that their projects are ours --\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they're yours. They're using your IP, your protocols, your\r\ndesigns.... If they don't come on board, you can just threaten to sue\r\nthem --\"\r\n\r\n\"Landon! Please listen to me. We are not going to effect a hostile\r\ntakeover of my friends. They are equal owners of everything we do\r\nhere. And no offense, but if you ever mention suing other projects\r\nover our 'IP'\" -- he made sarcastic finger quotes -- \"then we're\r\nthrough having any discussions about this. OK?\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell snorted air through his nostrils. \"My apologies, I didn't\r\nrealize that this was such a sensitive area for you.\" Perry boggled at\r\nthis -- lawsuits against ride operators! \"But I can get that. Here's\r\nthe thing, Perry. Without some kind of fast-moving structure you're\r\ngoing to be dead. Even if we repel the boarders this morning, they'll\r\nbe back tomorrow and the day after. You need something stronger than a\r\nbunch of friends who have loose agreements. You need a legal entity\r\nthat can speak for everyone. Maybe that's a co-op or a charity or\r\nsomething else, but it's got to exist. You may not think you have any\r\nsay over these other rides, but does everyone else agree? What if you\r\nget sued for someone's bad deeds in Minneapolis? What if some ride\r\noperator sues *you* to put you out of business?\"\r\n\r\nPerry's head swam. He hated conversations like this. He didn't have\r\nany good answer for Kettlewell's objections, but it was ridiculous. No\r\none from a ride was going to sue him. Or maybe they would, if he got\r\nall grabby and went MINE MINE MINE and incorporated everything with\r\nhim at the top. Hilda said he was the one they all looked to, but that\r\nwas because he would never try to hijack their projects.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"No what?\"\r\n\r\n\"No to all of it. We have to defend this thing, but we're not going to\r\ndo it by trying to tie everyone down to contracts and agreements where\r\nI get to control everything. Maybe a co-op is the right way to go, but\r\nwe can't just declare a co-op and force everyone to be members. We\r\nhave to get everyone to agree, everyone who's involved, and then they\r\ncan elect a council or something and work out some kind of uniform\r\nagreement. I mean, that's how all the good free software projects\r\nwork. There's authority, but it's not all unilateral and\r\nimperious. I'm not interested in that. I'd rather shut this down than\r\ndeclare myself pope-emperor of ride-land.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell scrubbed his eyes with his fists. Up close, the lines in\r\nhis face were deep-sunk, his eyeballs bloodshot and hung over. \"You're\r\nkilling me, you know that? What good is principle going to do when\r\nthey knock this fucking thing down and slap you with a gigantic\r\nlawsuit?\"\r\n\r\nPerry shrugged. \"I really appreciate what you've done, but I'd rather\r\nlose it than fuck it up.\"\r\n\r\nThey stared at each other for a long time. Cars whizzed past. Perry\r\nfelt like a big jerk. Kettlewell had done amazing work for him this\r\nmorning, just out of the goodness of his own heart, and Perry had\r\nrepaid him by being a stiff-necked dickwad. He felt an overwhelming\r\ndesire to take it back, just put Kettlewell in charge and let him run\r\nthe whole show. Just shrug his shoulders and abdicate.\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the ground and up into the straggly palms, then\r\nheaved a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Landon, I'm sorry, OK, but that's just how it is. I totally dig that\r\nyou're saying that we're risking everything by not doing it your way,\r\nbut from my seat, doing it your way will kill it anyway. So we need a\r\nbetter answer.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell scrubbed his eyes some more. \"You and my wife sound like\r\nyou'd get along.\"\r\n\r\nPerry waited for him to go on, but it became clear he had nothing more\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nPerry went back to the cop cars just as the first gang of goths showed\r\nup to take a ride.\r\n\r\n$$$$\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nSammy had filled a cooler and stuck it in the back-seat of his car the\r\nnight before, programmed his coffee-maker, and when his alarm roused\r\nhim at 3AM, he hit the road. First he guzzled his thermos of lethal\r\ncoffee, then reached around in back for bottles of icy distilled\r\nwater. He kept the windows rolled down and breathed in the swampy,\r\ncool morning air, the most promising air of the Florida day, before it\r\nall turned to steam and sizzle.\r\n\r\nHe didn't bother looking for truck-stops when he needed to piss, just\r\npulled over on the turnpike's side and let fly. Why not? At that hour,\r\nit was just him and the truckers and the tourists with morning\r\nflights.\r\n\r\nHe reached Miami ahead of schedule and had a diner-breakfast big\r\nenough to kill a lesser man, a real fatkins affair. He got back on the\r\nroad groaning from the chow and made it to the old Wal-Mart just as\r\nthe merchants were setting up their market on the roadside.\r\n\r\nWhen he'd done the Boston ride, he'd been discouraged that they'd kept\r\non with their Who-ville Xmas even though he'd grinched away all their\r\nfun, but this time he was expecting something like this. Watching\r\nthese guys sell souvenirs at the funeral for the ride made him feel\r\npretty good this time around: their disloyalty had to be a real\r\nmorale-killer for those ride-operators.\r\n\r\nThe cops were getting twitchy, which made him grin. Twitchy cops were\r\na key ingredient for bad trouble. He reached behind him and pulled an\r\niced coffee from the cooler and cracked it, listening to the hiss as\r\nthe embedded CO2 cartridge forced bubbles through it.\r\n\r\nNow here came a suit. He looked like a genuine mighty morphin' power\r\nbroker, which made Sammy worry, because a guy like that hadn't figured\r\ninto his plans, but look at that; he was having a huge fight with the\r\neyebrow guy and now the eyebrow guy was running away from him.\r\n\r\nGetting the lawyers to agree to spring the budget to file in every\r\nlocation where there was a ride had been tricky. Sammy had had to\r\nfudge a little on his research, claim that they were bringing in real\r\nmoney, tie it to the drop in numbers in Florida, and generally do a\r\nsong and dance, but it was all worth it. These guys clearly didn't\r\nknow whether to shit or go blind.\r\n\r\nNow eyebrow man was headed for the cop-cars and the entrance, and\r\nthere, oh yes, there it was. Five cars' worth of goths, lugging bags\r\nfull of some kind of home-made or scavenged horror-memorabilia,\r\npulling up short at the entrance.\r\n\r\nThey piled out of their cars and started milling around, asking\r\nquestions. Some approached the cops, who seemed in no mood to\r\nchat. The body-language could be read at 150 feet:\r\n\r\nGoth: But officer, I wanna get on this riiiiiide.\r\n\r\nCop: You sicken me.\r\n\r\nGoth: All around me is gloom, gloom. Why can't I go on my riiiiiide?\r\n\r\nCop: I would like to arrest you and lock you up for being a weird,\r\nsexually ambiguous melodramatic who's dumb enough to hang around out\r\nof doors, all in black, in *Florida*.\r\n\r\nGoth: Can I take your picture? I'm gonna put it on my blog and then\r\neveryone will know what a meanie you are.\r\n\r\nCop: Yap yap yap, little bitch. You go on photographing me and\r\nmouthing off, see how long it is before you're in cuffs in the back of\r\nthis car.\r\n\r\nScumbag street-vendors: Ha ha ha, look at these goth kids mouthing off\r\nto the law, that cop must have minuscule testicles!\r\n\r\nCop: Don't make me angry, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry.\r\n\r\nEyebrow guy: Um, can everyone just be nice? I'd prefer that this all\r\nnot go up in flames.\r\n\r\nScumbags, goths: Hurr hurr hurr, shuttup, look at those dumb cops,\r\nahahaha.\r\n\r\nCops: Grrrr.\r\n\r\nEyebrow: Oh, shit.\r\n\r\nFour more cars pulled up. Now the shoulder was getting really crowded\r\nand freeway traffic was slowing to a crawl.\r\n\r\nMore goths piled out. Family cars approached the snarl, slowed, then\r\nsped up again, not wanting to risk the craziness. Maybe some of them\r\nwould get on the fucking turnpike and drive up to Orlando, where the\r\nreal fun was.\r\n\r\nThe four-lane road was down to about a lane and a half, and milling\r\ncrowds from the shantytown and the arriving cars were clogging what\r\nremained of the thoroughfare. Now goths were parking their cars way\r\nback at the intersection and walking over, carrying the objects they'd\r\nplanned to sacrifice to the ride and smoking clove cigarettes.\r\n\r\nSammy saw Death Waits before Death Waits turned his head, and so Sammy\r\nhad time to duck down before he was spotted. He giggled to himself and\r\nchugged his coffee, crouched down below the window.\r\n\r\nThe situation was heating up now. Lots of people were asking questions\r\nof the cops. People trying to drive through got shouted at by the\r\npeople in the road. Sometimes a goth would slam a fist down on a hood\r\nand there'd be a little bit of back and forth. It was a powder-keg,\r\nand Sammy decided to touch it off.\r\n\r\nHe swung his car out into the road and hit the horn and revved his\r\nengine, driving through the crowd just a hair faster than was\r\nsafe. People slapped his car as it went by and he just leaned on the\r\nhorn, ploughing through, scattering people who knocked over vendors'\r\ntables and stepped on their wares.\r\n\r\nIn his rear-view, he saw the chaos begin. Someone threw a punch,\r\nsomeone slipped, someone knocked over a table of infringing\r\nmerch. Wa-hoo! Party time!\r\n\r\nHe hit the next left, then pointed his car at the freeway. He reached\r\nback and snagged another can of coffee and went to work on it. As the\r\ncan hissed open, he couldn't help himself: he chuckled. Then he\r\nlaughed -- a full, loud belly-laugh.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nPerry watched it happen as though it were all a dream: The crowds\r\nthickening. The cops getting out of their cars and putting their hands\r\non their belts. A distant siren. More people milling around, hanging\r\nout in the middle of the road, like idiots, *idiots*. Then that jerk\r\nin the car -- what the hell was he thinking, he was going to kill\r\nsomeone!\r\n\r\nAnd then it all exploded. There was a knot of fighting bodies over by\r\nthe tables, and the knot was getting bigger. The cops were running for\r\nthem, batons out, pepper-spray out. Perry shouted something, but he\r\ncouldn't hear himself. In a second the crowd noises had gone from\r\nfriendly to an angry roar.\r\n\r\nPerry spotted Suzanne watching it all through the viewfinder on her\r\nphone, presumably streaming it live, then shouted again, an unheard\r\nwarning, as a combatant behind her swung wide and clocked her in the\r\nhead. She went down and he charged for her.\r\n\r\nHe'd just reached her when a noise went off that dropped him to his\r\nknees. It was their antipersonnel sound-cannon, which meant that\r\nLester was around here somewhere. The sound was a physical thing, it\r\nmade his bowels loose and made his head ring like a gong. Thought was\r\nimpossible. Everything was impossible except curling up and wrapping\r\nyour hands around your head.\r\n\r\nPainfully, he raised his head and opened his eyes. All around him,\r\npeople were on their knees. The cops, though, had put giant industrial\r\nearmuffs on, the kind of thing you saw jackhammer operators\r\nwearing. They were moving rapidly toward... Lester who was in a pickup\r\ntruck with the AP horn stuck in the cargo bed, wired into the\r\ncigarette lighter. They had guns drawn and Lester was looking at them\r\nwide-eyed, hands in the air.\r\n\r\nTheir mouths were moving, but whatever they were saying was\r\ninaudible. Perry took his phone out of his pocket and aimed it at\r\nthem. He couldn't move without spooking them and possibly knocking\r\nhimself out from the sound, but he could rodneyking them as they\r\nadvanced on Lester. He could practically read Lester's thoughts: *If I\r\nmove to switch this off, they'll shoot me dead.*\r\n\r\nThe cops closed on Lester and then the sour old male cop was up in the\r\nbed and he had Lester by the collar, throwing him to the ground,\r\npointing his gun. His partner moved quickly and efficiently around the\r\nbed, eventually figuring out how to unplug the horn. The silence rang\r\nin his head. He couldn't hear anything except a dog-whistle whine from\r\nhis abused eardrums. Around him, people moved sluggishly, painfully.\r\n\r\nHe got to his feet as quick as he could and drunk-walked to the\r\ntruck. Lester was already in plastic cuffs and leg-restraints, and the\r\nbig, dead-eyed cop was watching an armored police bus roll toward them\r\nin the eerie silence of their collective deafness.\r\n\r\nPerry managed to switch his phone over to streaming, so that it was\r\nuploading everything instead of recording it locally. He faded back\r\nbehind some of the cars for cover and kept rolling as the riot bus\r\ndisgorged a flying squadron of helmeted cops who began to methodically\r\nand savagely grab, cuff, and toss the groaning crowd lying flat on the\r\nground. He wanted to add narration, but he didn't trust himself to\r\nwhisper, since he couldn't hear his own voice.\r\n\r\nA hand came down on his shoulder and he jumped, squeaked, and fell\r\ninto a defensive pose, waiting for the truncheon to hit him, but it\r\nwas Suzanne, grim faced, pointing her own phone. She had a laminated\r\npress-pass out in her free hand and was holding it up beside her head\r\nlike a talisman. She pointed off down the road, where some of the goth\r\nkids who'd just been arriving when things went down were more\r\nambulatory, having been somewhat shielded from the noise. They were\r\nrunning and being chased by cops. She made a little scooting gesture\r\nand Perry understood that she meant he should be following them,\r\ngetting the video. He sucked in a big breath and nodded once and set\r\noff. She gave his hand a firm squeeze and he felt that her palms were\r\nslick with sweat.\r\n\r\nHe kept low and moved slow, keeping the viewfinder up so that he could\r\nkeep the melee in shot. He hoped like hell that someone watching this\r\nonline would spring for his bail.\r\n\r\nMiraculously, he reached the outlier skirmish without being\r\nspotted. He recorded the cops taking the goths down, cuffing them, and\r\nhooding one kid who was thrashing like a fish on a hook. It seemed\r\nthat he would never be spotted. He crept forward, slowly, slowly,\r\ntrying to feel invisible and unnoticed, trying to project it.\r\n\r\nIt worked. He was getting incredible footage. He was practically on\r\ntop of the cops before anyone noticed him. Then there was a shout and\r\na hand grabbed for his phone and the spell was broken. Suddenly his\r\nheart was thundering, his pulse pounding in his ears.\r\n\r\nHe turned on his heel and ran. A mad giggle welled up in his\r\nchest. His phone was still streaming, presumably showing wild,\r\nnauseous shots of the landscape swinging past as he pumped his arm. He\r\nwas headed for the ride, for the rear entrance, where he knew he could\r\ntake cover. He felt the footsteps thud behind him, dimly heard the\r\nshouts -- but his temporary deafness drowned out the words.\r\n\r\nHe had his fob out before he reached the doors and he badged in,\r\nbanging the fob over the touch-plate an instant before slamming into\r\nthe crash-bar and the doors swung open. He waited in agitation for the\r\ndoors to hiss shut slowly after him and then it was the gloom of the\r\ninside of the ride, dark in his sun-adjusted eyesight.\r\n\r\nIt was only when the doors shivered behind him that he realized what\r\nhe'd just done. They'd break in and come and get him, and in the\r\nprocess, they'd destroy the ride, for spite. His eyes were adjusting\r\nto the gloom now and he made out the familiar/unfamiliar shapes of the\r\ndioramas, now black and lacy with goth memorabilia. This place gave\r\nhim calm and joy. He would keep them from destroying it.\r\n\r\nHe set his phone down on the floor, propped against a plaster skull so\r\nthat the doorway was in the shot. He walked to the door and shouted as\r\nloud as he could, his voice inaudible in his own ears. \"I'm coming out\r\nnow!\" he shouted. \"I'm opening the doors!\"\r\n\r\nHe waited for a two-count, then reached for the lock. He turned it and\r\nlet the door crash open as two cops in riot-visors came through,\r\npepper-spray at the fore. He was down on the ground, writhing and\r\nclawing at his face in an instant, and the phone caught it all.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nAll Perry wanted was for someone to cut the plastic cuffs off so he\r\ncould scrub at his eyes, though he knew that would only make it\r\nworse. The riot-bus sounded like an orgy, moaning and groaning with\r\ndozens of voices every time the bus jounced over a pothole.\r\n\r\nPerry was on the floor of the bus, next to a kid -- judging from the\r\nvoice -- who cursed steadily the whole way along. One hard jounce made\r\ntheir heads connect and they both cussed, then apologized to one\r\nanother, then laughed a little.\r\n\r\n\"My name's Perry.\" His voice sounded like he was underwater, but he\r\ncould hear. The pepper spray seemed to have cleared out his sinuses\r\nand given him back some of his hearing.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Death Waits.\" He said it without any drama. Perry wasn't sure if\r\nhe'd heard right. He supposed he had. Goth kids.\r\n\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Likewise.\" Their heads were banged together again. They laughed and\r\ncursed.\r\n\r\n\"Christ my face hurts,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not surprised. You look like a tomato.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucky me, yup. I got a pretty good couple of whacks on the back and\r\nshoulders once I was down, but no gas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucky you all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm more pissed that I lost the tombstone I brought down. It was a\r\nreal rarity, and it was hard to get, too. I bet it got tromped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tombstone, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the Graveyard Walk at Disney. They tore it down last week.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you were bringing it to add it to the ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure -- that's where it belongs.\"\r\n\r\nPerry's face still burned, but the pain was lessening. Before it had\r\nbeen like his face was on fire. Now it was like a million fire ants\r\nbiting him. He tried to put it out of his mind by concentrating on the\r\npain in his wrists where the plastic straps were cutting into him.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence. \"Has to go somewhere. Better there than in a\r\nvault or in the trash.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about selling it to a collector?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know, it never occurred to me. It means too much to go to a\r\ncollector.\"\r\n\r\n\"The tombstone means too much?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it sounds stupid, but it's true. You heard that Disney's\r\ntearing out all the goth stuff? Fantasyland meant a lot to some of\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't feel like it was, what, co-opting you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dude, you can buy goth clothes at a chain of mall-stores. We're all\r\nover the mainstream/non-mainstream fight. If Disney wants to put\r\ntogether a goth homeland, that's all right with me. And that ride, it\r\nwas the best place to remember it. You know that it got copied over\r\nevery night to other rides around the country? So all the people who\r\nloved the old Disney could be part of the memorial, even if they\r\ncouldn't come to Florida. We had the idea last week and everyone loved\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you were putting stuff from Disney rides into my ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I built it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fucking way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Way.\" He smiled and that made his face hurt.\r\n\r\n\"Dude, that is the coolest thing ever. You built that? How did -- How\r\ndo you become the kind of person who can build one of those things?\r\nI'm out of work and trying to figure out what to do next.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you could join one of the co-ops that's building the other\r\nrides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, I guess. But I want to be the kind of person who invents the\r\nidea of making something like that. Did you get an electrical\r\nengineering degree or something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just picked it up as I went along. You could do the same, I'm\r\nsure. But hang on a sec -- you were putting stuff from Disney rides\r\ninto my ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yeah. But it was stuff they'd torn down.\"\r\n\r\nPerry's eyes streamed. This couldn't be a coincidence, stuff from\r\nDisney rides showing up in his ride and the cops turning up to enforce\r\na court order Disney got. But he couldn't blame this kid, who sounded\r\nlike a real puppy-dog.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, you don't think the cops were there because --\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably. No hard feelings though. I might have done the same in your\r\nshoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh shit, I am *so sorry*. I didn't think it through at *all*, I can\r\nsee that now. Of course they'd come after you. They must totally hate\r\nyou. I used to work there, they just hate anything that takes a\r\nFlorida tourist dollar. It's why they built the monorail extension to\r\nOrlando airport -- to make sure that from the moment you get off the\r\nplane, you don't spend a nickel on anything that they don't sell\r\nyou. I used to think it was cool, because they built such great stuff,\r\nbut then they went after the new Fantasyland --\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't be a citizen of a themepark,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\nThe kid barked a laugh. \"Man, how true is *that*? You've nailed it,\r\npal.\"\r\n\r\nPerry managed to crack an eye, painfully, and catch a blurry look at\r\nthe kid: a black Edward Scissorhands dandelion clock of hair,\r\neyeliner, frock-coat -- but a baby-face with cheeks you could probably\r\nsee from the back of his head. About as threatening as a Smurf. Perry\r\nfelt a sudden, delayed rush of anger. How *dare* they beat up kids\r\nlike this \"Death Waits\" -- all he wanted to do was ride a goddamned\r\nride! He wasn't a criminal, wasn't out rolling old ladies or releasing\r\nmalicious bioorganisms on the beach!\r\n\r\nThe bus turned a sharp corner and their heads banged together\r\nagain. They groaned and then the doors were being opened and Perry\r\nsqueezed his eyes shut again.\r\n\r\nRough hands seized him and marched him into the station house. The\r\ncrowd susurrations were liquid in his screwed-up ears. He couldn't\r\nsmell or see, either. He felt like he was in some kind of terrible\r\nsensory deprivation nightmare, and it made him jerky, so whenever a\r\nhand took him and guided him to another station in the check-in\r\nprocess (his wallet lifted from his pocket, his cheek swabbed, his\r\nfingers pressed against a fingerprint scanner) he flinched\r\ninvoluntarily. The hands grew rougher and more insistent. At one\r\npoint, someone peeled open his swollen eyelid, a feeling like being\r\nstabbed in the eye, and his retina was scanned. He screamed and heard\r\nlaughter, distant through his throbbing eardrums.\r\n\r\nIt galvanized him. He forced his eyes open, glaring at the cops around\r\nhim. Mostly they were Florida crackers, middle-aged guys with\r\ndead-eyed expressions of impersonal malevolence. There was a tiny\r\nsmattering of brown faces and women's faces, but they were but a\r\nsprinkling when compared to the dominant somatype of Florida law.\r\n\r\nThe next time someone grabbed him to shove him towards the next\r\nstation on this quest, he jerked his arm away and sat down. He'd seen\r\nprotestors do this before, and knew that it was hard to move a sitting\r\nman expeditiously or with dignity. Hands seized him by the arms, and\r\nhe flailed until he was free, remaining firmly seated. The laughter\r\nwas turning to anger now. Beside him, someone else sat. Death Waits,\r\nlooking white-faced and round-eyed. More people hit the floor. A\r\nbilly-club was shoved under his arm, which was then twisted into an\r\nagonizing position. He was suddenly ready to give up the fight and go\r\nalong, but he couldn't get to his feet fast enough. With a sickening\r\n*crack*, his arm broke. He had a moment's lucid awareness that a bone\r\nhad broken in his body, and then the pain was on him and he choked out\r\na shout, then a louder one, and then everything went dark.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, his prison infirmary time didn't last long at\r\nall. Kettlewell had faded fast from the riot, headed back to the\r\nguesthouse and got the lawyers on the phone. He'd shown them the\r\nstream off of Perry's phone and they were in front of a judge before\r\nPerry reached the jail.\r\n\r\nPerry was led out of the infirmary with his arm in a sling. His face\r\nwas still painfully swollen, and he'd managed to turn an ankle as\r\nwell. At least his hearing was coming back.\r\n\r\nKettlewell took Perry's good arm and gave him a soulful hug that\r\nembarrassed him. Kettlewell led him outside, to where a big cab was\r\nwaiting. In it were the family Kettlewell, Lester, and Suzanne. Lester\r\nhad a couple bandages taped to his face and when Suzanne smiled, he\r\nsaw her lips were stained red and one of her front teeth had been\r\nknocked out.\r\n\r\nHe managed a brave smile. \"Looks like you guys got the full treatment,\r\nhuh?\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne squeezed his hand. \"Nothing that can't be fixed.\" Ada and\r\nPascal looked goggle-eyed at them. Ada was popping Korean lotus-bean\r\nwalnut cakes into her mouth from a greasy paper bag, and she offered\r\nthem silently to Perry, who took one just to be polite, but found\r\nafter the first bite that he wasn't really hungry after all.\r\n\r\nKettlewell and Perry fought about what to do next, but Kettlewell\r\nprevailed. He took them to a private doctor who photographed them and\r\nexamined them and x-rayed them, documenting everything while Ada\r\nKettlewell played camera-woman with her phone, videoing it all.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think suing the police is going to help, Landon,\" Perry\r\nsaid. Suzanne nodded vigorously. The three victims were in paper\r\nexamining gowns, and the Kettlewells were still in street clothes,\r\nwhich gave them a real advantage in the self-confidence department.\r\n\r\n\"It'll help if we cash out a big settlement -- it'll bankroll our\r\ndefense against the Disney trademark claims. IP lawyers charge more\r\nthan God per hour. I got the injunction lifted, but we're still going\r\nto have to go to court, and that's not going to be cheap.\"\r\n\r\nIt needled Perry -- he didn't like the idea of being embroiled in the\r\nlegal system in the first place, and while he could grudgingly admit a\r\ncertain elegance in using cash settlements from the law to fund their\r\ndefense in court, the whole business made him squirm.\r\n\r\nEva sat down beside him. \"I can tell this sucks for you, Perry.\" Ada\r\nwhispered the word *sucks* and giggled, and Eva rolled her eyes. \"But\r\nthere's fifty people we *didn't* bail out in there, who are all of\r\nthem going to have to figure out their own way through the legal\r\nsystem. You can't run a business if your customers risk a solid\r\nbeating and jail time just for showing up.\"\r\n\r\n*I don't want to run a business,* he thought, but he knew that was\r\n petulant. He was the man with the roll of bills down his\r\n pants. \"There are fifty people still in the slam?\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell nodded. Suzanne had her camera out and she was\r\nrecording. It had been a long time since Perry had really felt the\r\ncamera's eye on him. It was one thing to be recorded by some friends\r\nfor remembrance, but now Suzanne's camera seemed like the gaze of\r\nposterity. He needed to rise to it, he knew.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get them out. All of them.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell raised his eyebrows. \"And how do you plan on doing that?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll charge it to the business,\" Perry said. Lester chuckled and\r\ngave him a thump on the back. \"It's a legit expense -- these are our\r\n*customers* after all.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell shook his head at all of them, then he left the doctor's\r\noffice. He already had his phone stuck to his head and was talking\r\nwith the lawyer before he got out of earshot.\r\n\r\nPerry and Lester and Suzanne and Eva exchanged mischievous glances,\r\ngrinning with unexpected delight. Pascal, riding on Eva's hip, woke up\r\nand started crying and Eva handed him to Lester while she went for the\r\ndiaper bag.\r\n\r\n\"Here we go again,\" Lester said, wrinkling his nose and holding the\r\nwailing Pascal at arm's length.\r\n\r\nSuzanne got it all with her phone, then she flipped it shut and gave\r\nLester a hard kiss on the cheek.\r\n\r\n\"Fatherhood would suit you,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe went bright red. \"Don't you get any ideas,\" he said. Suzanne\r\nlaughed and skipped away, looking all of ten.\r\n\r\nPerry felt huge. Larger than life. The adventure was beginning anew,\r\nwith these good people whom he loved like family. He had the work and\r\nthe people, and who needed anything more.\r\n\r\nIt was a feeling that lasted all the way back to the ride.\r\n\r\nBut then he surveyed the ride itself and found it in utter ruins, far\r\nworse than it had been left when he'd been dragged out of it. Every\r\nsingle exhibit was smashed, strewn here and there.\r\n\r\nHe couldn't believe it. He brought up the clean-up lights, flooding\r\nthe place, and then he saw what he'd missed at first: the smashed\r\nexhibits were not smashed exhibits -- they were *replicas* of smashed\r\nexhibits. At every ride in the country, police had gone in smashing,\r\nand every other ride in the country had faithfully reproduced the\r\ndamage, dutiful printers churning out replica detritus and dutiful\r\nrobots placing it with micrometer precision.\r\n\r\nHe began to laugh and couldn't stop. Lester came in and immediately\r\ngot the joke and laughed along with him. They managed to stop laughing\r\njust long enough to explain it to Suzanne and Kettlewell, who didn't\r\nfind it nearly as funny as they did. Suzanne took pictures.\r\n\r\nFinally he got down to business, opening the change-log and rolling\r\nthe ride back through the \"revisions\" to its unsmashed state. It would\r\ntake the robots a long time to set everything right again, but at\r\nleast he didn't have to oversee it.\r\n\r\nInstead, he tracked down as many of the market-stall vendors as he\r\ncould locate in the shantytown and made sure they were all right --\r\nthey were, though they'd lost some inventory. He comped them all a\r\nmonth's rent and made sure they knew that steps were being taken to\r\nkeep it from happening again. He knew that they could make nearly as\r\nmuch money selling from a roadside or online, and he wanted to keep\r\nthem happy. Besides, it wasn't their fault.\r\n\r\nHe was exhausted and his arm was really starting to gripe him. He\r\nfound himself stopping in the street every few steps to rub his eyes\r\nand force himself on. Francis came on him when he was like that,\r\nleaning against the prefab concrete wall of one of the tall, twisty\r\nshanties, and he took Perry's car-keys away and drove him home. Perry\r\nwas in too much of a state by the time he got there to think about how\r\nFrancis would get back -- he was already lying in bed before it\r\noccurred to him that the old man with the gimpy leg probably walked\r\nthe ten miles home.\r\n\r\nHe woke up later that night to sex noises from Lester's room and he\r\nrecognized Suzanne's voice. Later, he woke again to hear the tail end\r\nof another argument between Lester and Suzanne, and then Suzanne\r\nstorming out of the apartment. *Oh, goody*, he thought. He lay on his\r\nback, trying to find sleep again -- the clock said 3AM -- and found\r\nthoughts of Hilda drifting unbidden into his mind.\r\n\r\nIt was silly -- they'd only spent one night together, and he had to\r\nadmit that as great as the sex had been, he'd had better with the\r\nfatkins gymnasts you could pick up down on South Beach. She was too\r\nyoung for him. She lived in *Wisconsin*. But there were touches in the\r\nride that had originated with her instantiation -- he looked over the\r\nlogs every now and then -- and he found himself contemplating them\r\nwith sentimental smiles.\r\n\r\nHe fell asleep again and only woke when he rolled over on his bad arm\r\nand yelped himself awake. The smell of waffles, bacon and eggs was\r\nstrong in the apartment. He couldn't be bothered to figure out how to\r\nshower with his cast on, so he pulled on a pair of shorts and let\r\nhimself into the living room.\r\n\r\nLester was at the stove, cooking up half a pig and pouring maple\r\nbatter into the waffle-iron. He waved a spatula at him and pointed out\r\nat the terrace. Perry stepped out and saw Suzanne and Tjan and Tjan's\r\nlittle kids -- what were their names? Lyenitchka and the little boy?\r\nMan, the whole family was here.\r\n\r\n\"Your arm is broken,\" Lyenitchka said, pointing at him.\r\n\r\nPerry nodded gravely. \"That's true. Want to sign my cast?\" He was\r\npretty sure that he had a grease-pencil that would mark the surface,\r\nthough the hospital had sworn that it would shed dirt, ink and\r\nanything else he threw at it.\r\n\r\nShe nodded vigorously. Tjan looked him over and gave a little wave,\r\nthen Perry went back into the living room and asked his computer to\r\nfind the grease-pencil.\r\n\r\n\"Thought you'd be busy in Boston,\" he said, while Lyenitchka\r\npainstakingly spelled out her name, going over the letters to get them\r\nto show up dark -- the cast surface really didn't want to suck up any\r\ntint.\r\n\r\n\"Boston came out OK. We had lawyers on tap at the start and the vibe\r\nwas cool. I incorporated there, so it was easier than you guys had\r\nit. But some of the others were hit bad, like San Francisco and\r\nMadison.\"\r\n\r\n\"*Madison*?\" Perry was alarmed by how alarmed he sounded.\r\n\r\n\"Mass arrests. The cops there are real hard-cases, with all this\r\nantipersonnel gear left over from the stem-cell riots.\"\r\n\r\nPerry jerked and spoiled Lyenitchka's writing. He patted her head and\r\nset his arm back down where she could get at it. He groaned.\r\n\r\n\"They're mostly still in. We're trying to get them bailed out, but the\r\njudge at the arraignment set bail pretty high.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll post it,\" Perry said. \"I can put up my savings or something...\"\r\n\r\nTjan looked uncomfortable. \"Perry, there are 250 people in the lockup\r\nin Wisconsin. Some of them are going to skip out, it's nearly a\r\ncertainty. If you bail them all out, you'll go broke. I mean, it's\r\ngood to see you and I'm sorry you got hurt and all respect, but don't\r\nbe an idiot.\"\r\n\r\nPerry felt himself go belligerent. His hands went into fists and his\r\nbroken wing protested. That brought him back to reality. He forced\r\nhimself to smile.\r\n\r\n\"There's a girl in Madison, I want to make sure she's OK.\"\r\n\r\nTjan and Suzanne stared at him for a second. Then Lester clapped him\r\nacross the back from behind him, startling him and making him\r\nsqueak. \"Big fella!\" he crowed. \"I should have known.\"\r\n\r\nPerry gave him a mock glare. \"*You* have no right to say *anything* on\r\nthis score.\" He darted a glance at Suzanne and saw that she was\r\nblushing. Tjan took this in and nodded, as though his suspicions had\r\njust been confirmed.\r\n\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Tjan said. \"Let's make some inquiries about the young\r\nlady. What's her name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hilda Hammersen.\"\r\n\r\nTjan's eyebrows shot up. \"Hilda *Hammersen*? From the mailing lists?\r\n*That* Hilda?\"\r\n\r\nHilda was the queen of the mailing lists -- brash, quick, and\r\nargumentative, but never the kind of person who started\r\nflamewars. Hilda's arguments were hot and fast, and she always\r\nwon. Perry had watched her admiringly from the sidelines, only\r\nweighing in occasionally, but he seemed to remember now that she'd\r\ntaken Tjan to the cleaners once on an issue of protocol resolution.\r\n\r\n\"That's the one,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"I always pictured her as being about fifty, with a machete between\r\nher teeth,\" Lester said. \"No offense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lyenitchka, go get my phone from my bed-stand,\" Perry said, patting\r\nthe girl on the shoulder. When she got back he went through his photos\r\nof Hilda with them.\r\n\r\nLester made a wolf-whistle and Suzanne punched him in the shoulder and\r\ntook the phone away.\r\n\r\n\"She's very pretty,\" Suzanne said, disapprovingly. \"And very young.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, dating younger people is *so* sleazy,\" Lester said with a\r\nchuckle. Suzanne squirmed and even Perry had to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Guys, here it is. I need to spring Hilda, and we need to do something\r\nabout all those customers and supporters and so on who went to jail\r\ntoday. We need to fight all the injunctions -- all of them -- and\r\nprevent them from recurring.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we need to eat breakfast, which is ready,\" Lester said, gesturing\r\nat the table behind him, which was stacked high with waffles,\r\nsausages, eggs, toast, and pitchers of juice and carafes of coffee.\r\n\r\nLyenitchka and Sasha looked at each other and ran to the table, taking\r\nseats next to one another. The adults followed and soon they were\r\neating. Perry managed a waffle and a sausage, but then he went off to\r\nhis room. Hilda was in the slam in Madison, and who the hell knew what\r\nthe antipersonnel stuff the Madison cops used had done to her. He just\r\nwanted to get on a fucking plane and *go there*.\r\n\r\nHalfway through his shower, he knew that that was what he was going to\r\ndo. He packed a shoulder-bag, took a couple more painkillers, and\r\nwalked out into the living room.\r\n\r\n\"Guys, I'm going to Madison. I'll be back in a day or two. We'll work\r\neverything out over the phone, OK?\"\r\n\r\nLester and Suzanne came over to him. \"You going to be OK, buddy?\"\r\nLester said.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be fine,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"We can spring her from here,\" Tjan said. \"We have the Internet, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" Perry said. \"You do that, OK? And tell her I'll be there as\r\nsoon as I can.\"\r\n\r\nThe security at the airport went bonkers over him. The perfect storm:\r\na fresh arrest, a suspicious cast, and a ticket bought with cash. He\r\nmissed the first two flights to Chicago, but by mid-afternoon he was\r\nlanding at O'Hare and submitting to an interim screening procedure\r\nbefore boarding for Madison. His phone rang in the middle of the\r\nscreening, and the wrinkly old TSA goon-lady primly informed him that\r\nhe might as well get that since once the phone rings, they have to\r\nstart the procedure over again.\r\n\r\n\"Tjan,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"They can't spring her today. Tomorrow, though.\"\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes and shut out the TSA goon. She had a huge bouffant\r\nof copper hair, and a midwesterner's sense of proportionality when it\r\ncame to eye-shadow and rouge. She was the kind of woman who could call\r\nyou \"honey\" and make it sound like \"Islamofascist faggot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, Tjan?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. \"She's in the infirmary and they won't release her\r\nuntil tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Infirmary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing serious -- she took a knock on the head and they want to hold\r\nher for observation.\"\r\n\r\nHe pictured a copper's electrified billy-club coming down on shining\r\nblond hair and felt like throwing up.\r\n\r\n\"Perry? Buddy. She's OK, really. I had our lawyer visit her in the\r\nprison infirmary and she swears she looks great. The lawyer's name is\r\nCandice -- take a cab to her office from the airport. OK?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is she in the prison infirmary, Tjan? Why can't she be moved to a\r\nreal hospital?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just a liability thing. The police don't want to risk the suit\r\nif she goes complicated on them between hospitals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seriously, she's fine. We've got a good lawyer on the scene.\"\r\n\r\nBut Perry had a bad feeling. The TSA goon picked up on it and gave him\r\na little bit of extra attention. Acting nervous or agitated in an\r\nairport was a one-way ticket to a cavity search.\r\n\r\nBut then he was lifting off and headed for Madison, and though the\r\ntime crawled on the one-hour flight, it was, after all, only an\r\nhour. He even napped briefly, though a sky marshall woke him shortly\r\nafter for a random bag-search. His fellow passengers -- badly dressed\r\nmidwesterners and a couple of hipster students -- all turned their\r\nbags out in the cramped cabin and then got back in their seats for the\r\nlanding.\r\n\r\nPerry had meant to phone in a car reservation at O'Hare, but the extra\r\nsearch had eaten up the time he'd allocated for it, and now all the\r\nrental counters were sold out. Reluctantly, he got into a taxi and\r\nasked the driver to take him to the office of the lawyers that Tjan\r\nhad hired.\r\n\r\nThe cabbie was a young African kid with a shaved head. He had a dent\r\nin one temple and more dents in one of his wrists, visible as he let\r\nhis long hands drape over the steering wheel.\r\n\r\n\"I know where it is,\" he said when Perry gave him the address. \"That\r\nlawyer, she is very good. She helped me with the Homeland Security.\"\r\n\r\nThe kid was young, 21 or 22, with a studious air, despite his old\r\ninjuries. He reminded Perry of the shantytowners, people who didn't\r\nalways get medical attention for their ailments, people who were often\r\nmissing a tooth or two, who had mysterious lumps from badly-set bones\r\nor scars or funny eyebrows like his. The midwesterners on the plane\r\nhad been flawless as action-figures, but Perry's friends and this\r\nAfrican kid looked like something carved out of coal and chalk.\r\n\r\nPerry was one big jitter from the trip and the coffee and the pills\r\nfor his arm, but he found himself drawn into conversation as they\r\nwhizzed past the fields and malls, the factories and office-parks.\r\n\r\n\"I'm from Gulu, in Uganda. There has been civil war there for thirty\r\nfive years. I studied chemical engineering through the African Virtual\r\nUniversity wiki-program, and qualified for a Chavez scholarship here\r\nin Madison.\" His accent was light but exotic, the African rolling of\r\nthe Rs, the British-sounding vowel-shifts. \"But the Homeland Security\r\ndidn't want to renew my visa last year. They said I had financial\r\nirregularities. I was paypalling to a friend in Kampala who withdrew\r\nit in shillings and sent it to my family in giros. Homeland Security\r\nsaid that I was *money laundering*. I thought I'd be sent away or put\r\nin prison, but Ms Candice wrote them a letter and they vanished.\" He\r\nsnapped his long, knuckly fingers for emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus. Well, that's good. She's going to help me get my girlfriend\r\nout of jail.\" Perry realized he'd just called Hilda his girlfriend,\r\nwhich would be news to her, but there it was.\r\n\r\n\"You don't need to worry. She'll get your friend free.\"\r\n\r\nPerry nodded and tried to close his eyes and relax. He couldn't. What\r\nthe hell had happened to the world. It had seemed so exciting when his\r\nfather was bringing home new shapes he'd spun off his CAD/CAM\r\nrig. When Perry had started to trade designs with people, to\r\neffortlessly find people on the net who wanted to collaborate with him\r\nand vice-versa. When Perry had started a business making cool art out\r\nof free junk and selling it off an Internet connection that was\r\nlikewise free.\r\n\r\nFree, free, free. No need to talk to a government, or grovel for a\r\ncurator, or put up with an agent or a boss. He'd just assumed all\r\nalong that he'd end up living in a world where all those parasites and\r\nbullies and middlemen would just blow away in the wind.\r\n\r\nBut they'd all found jobs in the new world. They weren't needed\r\nanymore, but that didn't mean that they went away. Now they were\r\nwanding him in airports and suing him for trademark infringement and\r\nbusting his girlfriend and breaking his arm and giving hassle to this\r\npoor African kid who'd taught himself to be an engineer with a\r\nferchrissakes *wiki*.\r\n\r\nHe dry-swallowed another pain-killer and then remembered that taking\r\nthe pills meant he wouldn't be able to get a drink, which he could\r\nsure as shit use.\r\n\r\n\"My name's Perry,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Richard,\" the driver said. \"We're almost there, Perry. I wish you the\r\nvery best of luck.\"\r\n\r\n\"You too,\" he said. The driver shook his hand warmly after getting his\r\nluggage out of the trunk, a limp handshake by North American\r\nstandards, but gentle and friendly nonetheless. His dented wrist\r\nflexed oddly as the half-knit bones there moved.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer's office was not what Perry was expecting. It looked like\r\nsomeone's living room, with a couple of overstuffed sofas, a dozing\r\ncat, and the lawyer, Candice, who was a young-looking woman in her\r\nmid-twenties. She dressed in jeans and an oversized UW sweatshirt,\r\nwith a laptop perched on one knee. She had a friendly, open face,\r\nframed with lots of curly brown hair.\r\n\r\n\"You must be Perry,\" she said, setting the laptop down and giving him\r\nan unexpected hug. \"That was from Hilda. I saw her a couple hours\r\nago. She was very adamant that I pass it on to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nice to meet you, he said, accepting a cup of tea from an insulated\r\njug on a cardboard side-board. \"Hilda is all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" the lawyer said.\r\n\r\nPerry's stomach turned a somersault. \"Hilda's all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit.\"\r\n\r\nPerry sat.\r\n\r\n\"She was gassed with a neurotoxin that has given her a temporary but\r\nsevere form of Parkinson's disease. Normally it just renders people\r\nimmobile, but one in a million has a reaction like this. It's just bad\r\nluck that Hilda was one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was *gassed*?\"\r\n\r\n\"They all were. There was a hell of a fight, as I understand it. It\r\nreally looks like it was the cops' fault. Someone told them that there\r\nwere printed guns in the ride-location and they used extreme and\r\ndisproportionate force.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" Perry said. His blood whooshed in his ears. Printed guns? No\r\nfrigging way. Sure, ray-guns in some of the exhibits. But nothing that\r\nfired anything. He felt tears begin to stream down his face. The\r\nlawyer moved to his sofa and put her arm around his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"She's going to be fine,\" Candice said. \"The Parkinson's is rare, but\r\nit goes away in 100 percent of the the cases where it occurs. What\r\nthis means is that we've got an amazing chance of taking a huge bite\r\nout of the local law that we can use to fund future defense. Tjan told\r\nme that that's the strategy and I think it's sound. Plus the harder we\r\nhit the law today, the more reluctant they'll be to rush off\r\nhalf-cocked the next time someone trumps up a BS trademark claim. It\r\ncould be much worse, Perry. There's a kid who lost an eye to a rubber\r\nbullet.\"\r\n\r\nPerry fisted the tears away. \"Let's go get her,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"They say she shouldn't be moved,\" Candice said.\r\n\r\n\"What does our doctor say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I phoned a couple MDs this afternoon and got conflicting\r\nstories. Everyone agrees that not moving her is safer than moving her,\r\nthough. The only disagreement is about how dangerous it would be to\r\nmove her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go see her, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"That we can do.\"\r\n\r\nPerry had trouble with the search at the prison hospital. His cast and\r\ntheir scanners didn't get along and they couldn't be satisfied with a\r\nhand search. For a couple minutes it looked like he was going to be\r\nkept out, but Candice -- who had changed into a power-suit before they\r\nleft the office -- put on a stern voice and demanded to speak to the\r\nduty sergeant, and then to his commanding officer, and in ten minutes,\r\nthey were on the hospital ward, where the metal-railed beds had\r\nprisoners handcuffed to them.\r\n\r\n\"Hilda?\" She looked sunken and sick, her face slack and her jaw\r\naskew. Her eyes opened and rolled crazily, they focused on him. Her\r\nbody shook through two waves of tremors before she was able to raise a\r\nshaking hand toward him, trailing IV tubes. She was trying to say his\r\nname, but it wouldn't come out, just a series of plosive Ps.\r\n\r\nBut then he took her hand and felt its fine warmth, the calluses he\r\nremembered from all those months ago, and he felt better. Actually\r\nbetter. Felt some peace for the first time in a long time.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Hilda,\" he said, and he was smiling so broadly his face hurt,\r\nand tears were running down his cheeks and dripping off his nose and\r\nrunning into his mouth. She was weeping, too, her head vibrating like\r\na bobble-doll. He bent over her and took her head in his hands,\r\nburying them in her thick blond hair, and kissed her on the lips. She\r\nshook under him, but she kissed him back, he could feel her lips move\r\non his.\r\n\r\nThey kissed for a long time. He subconsciously took note of the fact\r\nthat Candice had moved back, giving them some privacy. When the kiss\r\nbroke, he had an overwhelming desire to tell her he loved her, but\r\nthey hadn't taken that step yet, and maybe a prison hospital bed\r\nwasn't the right place to make pronouncements of love.\r\n\r\n\"I love you,\" he said softly, in her ear, kissing the lobe. \"I love\r\nyou, Hilda.\"\r\n\r\nShe cried harder, and made choking sobs. He hugged her as hard as he\r\ndared. Candice came back and stood by them.\r\n\r\n\"They think that she'll be better in the morning. She's already much\r\nbetter off than she was just a couple hours ago. Sleep's the only\r\nthing for it. They've got her mildly sedated, too.\"\r\n\r\nHilda smelled like he remembered, the undersmell beneath her shampoo\r\nand the chemicals clinging to her hair. It took him back to their\r\nnight together, and he stroked her cheek.\r\n\r\n\"I'll stay here,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that they're going to let you do that, Perry. This is a\r\nprison, not a hospital.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll stay here,\" he said again. \"Just make it happen, OK? We're going\r\nto sue them into a smoking hole, right? That's got to give us some\r\nleverage. I'll stay here.\"\r\n\r\nShe sighed and looked at him for a long time, but he wouldn't take his\r\neyes off of Hilda. His broken arm throbbed and he was out of\r\npainkillers. They'd have painkillers here.\r\n\r\nCandice went away, and then, a while later, she came back. \"Stay\r\nhere,\" she said. \"I'll come and get you in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" he said. Then he thought that he should say something more,\r\nand he turned around, but the lawyer had gone.\r\n\r\nHe fell asleep holding Hilda's hand with his good hand, and woke up\r\nwith an unbelievable pain in his broken arm and couldn't find a\r\nnurse. He bit down on the pain and spent a long watch that night\r\nstaring at Hilda, thinking of all she meant to him and how weird it\r\nwas that she meant so much when they'd had so brief a moment\r\ntogether. They hadn't let him bring his phone in, or he'd have taken a\r\nthousand pictures of her face in repose. He nodded off again.\r\n\r\nHe woke when she did, stirring in her bed. Her movements were still\r\nweak and feeble, but they lacked the uncontrolled tremors of the night\r\nbefore. He leaned in for a kiss, not caring about his sour breath or\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Morning, gorgeous,\" she said, and took him in a soft, sleepy hug.\r\n\r\nCandice sprung them and took them across town to her doctor, a young\r\nman who took great care in examining Hilda, explaining patiently which\r\nfluids he was drawing and which tests he planned on running on\r\nthem. Perry had noticed that midwesterners came in two flavors: big\r\nScandinavian Aryans with giant shoulders and easy smiles, and exchange\r\nstudents and immigrants in varying shades of brown, who looked hurt\r\nand bent alongside of the natives -- looked like the people he knew\r\nfrom back home, people who didn't have ready access to medical care or\r\ngood nutrition in their formative years.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was Vietnamese, but he was at least a couple generations\r\nin, judging by his accent, and he had the same midwestern smile and\r\nseemed big and bulky compared with the Vietnamese people Perry knew in\r\nFlorida. He watched the man peer intently at a screen after taping\r\nsome electrodes to Hilda's head, and felt like he'd come to some land\r\nof Norse giants.\r\n\r\nThe doctor eventually told Hilda to go home and rest, and she promised\r\nshe would. Perry and she got into the back of Candice's car and\r\ncuddled up to one another, dozing. It wasn't until Perry got back with\r\nher to her apartment -- every stick of furniture made from clever\r\ncardboard -- and emptied out his pockets that he remembered to switch\r\nhis phone on again.\r\n\r\nHe was down to his boxers and she was in cotton PJs with sexy cowgirls\r\nprinted on them, and when he powered the phone up, it went bonkers,\r\nlighting up like a Christmas tree, vibrating, and making urgent\r\nbleats.\r\n\r\n\"Shit,\" he said, and began to sort through the alerts while his back\r\nand neck muscles tightened. He sat on the edge of the bed and prodded\r\nat the phone with his right hand, holding it awkwardly in his left\r\nhand, trying to work around the cast. Hilda took the phone and held it\r\nfor him so he could work more freely and they both read what was going\r\non.\r\n\r\nA second round of lawsuits had been filed that night, and the\r\ninjunctions had been reinstated. The story about the rides being a\r\nsource of printed arms and munitions had spread, and in San Francisco\r\nthe ride had been taken apart by Homeland Security bomb robots that\r\nhad detonated several key pieces of equipment. Three of the San\r\nFrancisco ride-crew ended up in the hospital after clashes with\r\noverreacting cops.\r\n\r\nHilda nodded and took the phone from him and set it down.\r\n\r\n\"Right, what's the game-plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"How should I know?\" Perry said. He could hear the whine in his\r\nvoice. \"I just build stuff. Tjan and Candice say that they think we\r\ncan sue the cops over the brutality and use the money to fund legal\r\ndefenses, but Disney's denial-of-service attacking us in the\r\ncourtroom. They're also getting all this destruction dealt to us by\r\nthe cops.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know how you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Let's break\r\nthis down into small component pieces and work on solutions to them,\r\nthen call up the troops and let them know what's going on. I'll get a\r\nconference call set up while we chat.\"\r\n\r\nShe was still moving slowly and weakly, and he tried to get her to put\r\ndown her laptop and rest, but she wasn't having any of it.\r\n\r\nAnd so they worked, dividing the problem up into manageable pieces:\r\nincorporating a nonprofit co-op, writing the by-laws, getting the word\r\nout through the press, re-opening the rides, putting together\r\nscrapbooks of the carnage wrought.\r\n\r\nIt all seemed do-able once it was reduced to its component\r\nparts. Perry put it all online and then conferenced Tjan and\r\nKettlewell in.\r\n\r\n\"Perry, do you think it's a good idea to tell our enemies how we plan\r\nto respond to them?\"\r\n\r\nHilda shook her head and put a hand on Perry's good arm to calm him\r\ndown before he answered Kettlewell. \"That's how we do it over on our\r\nside. Their side is all about secrecy. Our side trades the advantage\r\nof surprise for the advantage of openness. You watch -- by tonight\r\nwe'll have by-laws drafted, press-releases, exhaustive\r\ndocumentation. You watch.\"\r\n\r\nOn the screen, Lester's face suddenly hove into view, fish-eye\r\ndistorted by his proximity to the lens. Hilda gave an amused squeak\r\nand pulled back.\r\n\r\n\"So that's Yoko, huh?\" Lester said, grinning. \"Cute! Listen guys,\r\ndon't let these suits talk you out of what you're doing. This is the\r\nright thing. I'm on all the message boards and stuff and they're all\r\nchamping to do something for real.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yoko?\" Hilda said. She raised an adorable eyebrow.\r\n\r\n\"Just a figure of speech,\" Lester said. \"I'm Lester. You must be\r\nHilda. Perry's told us practically nothing about you, which is\r\nprobably a sign of something or other.\"\r\n\r\nHilda regarded Perry with mock coolness. \"Oh really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lester,\" Perry said. \"I love you like a brother. Shut the fuck up\r\nalready.\"\r\n\r\nLester made a little whipping motion. Suddenly he was gone from the\r\npicture, and they saw Suzanne pulling him away by one ear. Hilda\r\nsnorted. \"I like her,\" she said. Suzanne gave them a wave and Tjan and\r\nKettlewell came back into frame.\r\n\r\nThey made their goodbyes and hung up. Now Hilda and Perry were alone,\r\ntogether, in her bedroom, laptops shut, day done -- though it was\r\nhardly gone noon -- and the silence stretched.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for coming, Perry,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I --\" He broke off. He didn't know what to say. They had only known\r\neach other for a day, only had a one-night stand. She probably thought\r\nthat he was a giant creep. \"I was worried.\" he said. \"Um. You should\r\nprobably rest up some more, right?\"\r\n\r\nHe got up and headed for the door.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you think you're going?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Figured I'd let you rest,\" he said with a half-shrug.\r\n\r\n\"Get in this bed this instant, young man,\" she said, slapping the bed\r\nbeside her. \"And get those stinky clothes off before you do -- I won't\r\nhave you getting my sheets all covered in your travel-grime.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt the foolish grin spread across his face and he skinned out of\r\nhis clothes as fast as he could with his cast on.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThey didn't leave the house until suppertime, freshly showered (she'd\r\nbeen a delightful help in scrubbing those spots where the cast impeded\r\naccess) and changed. Perry took a painkiller after the shower, which\r\nkicked in as they went out the door, and the autumn evening was crisp\r\nand sharp.\r\n\r\nThey got as far as the corner before the man approached them. \"Perry\r\nGibbons, isn't it?\" He had an English accent, and a little pot-belly,\r\nand a big white bubble-jacket and a scarf wound round his throat.\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Perry said. He looked at the guy. \"Do I know you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't think so. But I've followed you in the press. Quite\r\nremarkable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" Perry said. Being recognized -- how weird was that. Cool\r\nthat it happened in front of Hilda. \"This is Hilda,\" he said. She took\r\nthe man's hand, and he grinned, showing two long rat-like front teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Fred,\" he said. \"What an absolute delight running into you out here\r\nof all places. What are you doing in town?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just visiting with friends,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't there some kind of dust-up at your place in Florida? I saw\r\nwhat they did to the ride here, what a bloody mess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Perry said. He pointed at his casted arm. \"Seemed like a good\r\ntime to get out of Dodge.\"\r\n\r\nHilda said, \"We're getting some dinner, if you'd like to come along.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't want to intrude.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's no sweat, we've got a whole bunch of people associated with\r\nthe ride meeting us. You'd be more than welcome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodness, that *is* hospitable of you. How can I refuse?\"\r\n\r\nLuke and Ernie were there with their girlfriends, and there were more\r\nkids, midwestern and healthy even if they weren't necessarily all\r\nScandic, some Vietnamese kids, some Hmong, some desis descended from\r\nthe H1B diaspora. They had a gigantic meal in a student place that was\r\nheavy on the potatoes and beers the size of your head, which Perry\r\nresisted for a couple hours until he figured that he'd metabolized\r\nmost of the painkiller and then started in, getting just short of\r\nroaring drunk. He told them war stories, told them about Death Waits,\r\ntold them about the co-op and the plan to fight back.\r\n\r\n\"That just doesn't sound right to me,\" said a friend of Luke's, a\r\nlaw-school grad student who had been bending Perry's ear all night\r\nwith stories from his law-clinic work defending university students\r\nfrom music-industry lawsuits. \"I mean, sure, go after the cops because\r\nthey roughed you guys up, but how much money do the cops have? You\r\ngotta target some fat cash, and for that you want to go after\r\nDisney. Abuse of trademark, abuse of process, something like that. The\r\nstandard's pretty high, but if you can get a judgement, the money is\r\nincredible. You could take them to the cleaners.\"\r\n\r\nPerry looked blearily at him. He was young, like all of them, but he\r\nhad a good rhetorical style that Perry recognized as something born of\r\nreal confidence. He knew his stuff, or thought he did. He had a\r\nstrawberry mark on his high forehead that looked like a map of a\r\ndistant island, and Perry thought that the mark probably threw off the\r\nkid's opponents. \"So we sue Disney and five years from now we cash in\r\n-- how does that help us now?\"\r\n\r\nThe kid nodded. \"I hoped you'd ask me that. I've been thinking about\r\nthis a lot lately. Here's what you need to do, dude, here's the\r\nfucking thing.\" The room had grown silent. Everyone leaned\r\ncloser. Fred poured Perry another beer from the pitcher in the middle\r\nof the table. \"Here's how you do it. You raise investment capital for\r\nit. There's a ton of money in this, a ton. Disney's got deep pockets\r\nand you've got a great case.\r\n\r\n\"But like you say, it'll take ten, fifteen years to get the money out\r\nof them. And it'll cost a mil in legal fees on the way. So what you do\r\nis, you create an investment syndicate. You can maybe get thirty\r\nmillion out of Disney, plus whatever the jury awards in punitives, and\r\nif you keep half of it, you can deliver a fifteen-x return on\r\ninvestment. So go find a millionaire and borrow sixteen million, and\r\nturn the defense over to him.\"\r\n\r\nPerry was dumbstruck. \"You're joking. How can that possibly work?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's how patent lawsuits work! Some dickhead engineer gets a bogus\r\npatent for his doomed startup, and as they're sinking into the mud,\r\nsome venture capitalist comes and buys the company up just so it can\r\ngo around and threaten other companies with real businesses for\r\nviolating the patent. They ask for sums just below what it would cost\r\nto get the US Patent and Trademark Office to invalidate the patent,\r\nand everyone ponies up. Venture capitalism is the major source of\r\nfunding for commercial lawsuits these days.\"\r\n\r\nFred laughed and clapped. \"Brilliant! Perry, that's just\r\nbrilliant. Are you going to do it?\"\r\n\r\nPerry looked at the table, doodling in the puddles of beer with a\r\nfingertip. \"I just want to get back to making stuff, you know. This is\r\nnuts. Devoting ten years of my life to suing someone?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't have to do the suing. That's the point. You outsource\r\nthat. You get the money; someone else does the business stuff.\" Hilda\r\nput her arm around his shoulders. \"Give the suits something to occupy\r\nthemselves with -- otherwise they get antsy and stir up trouble.\"\r\n\r\nPerry and Hilda laughed like it was the funniest thing they'd ever\r\nheard. Fred and the others joined in, and Perry scrawled a drunken\r\nnote to Tjan and Kettlewell with the info. The party broke up not long\r\nafter, amid much chortling and snorting, and they staggered home. Fred\r\ngave Perry a warm handshake and treated Hilda to a lingering, sloppy\r\nhug until she pushed him off, laughing even harder.\r\n\r\n\"All right then,\" Perry said, \"home again home again.\"\r\n\r\nHilda gave his groin a friendly honk and then made a dash for it, and\r\nhe gave chase.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nPHOTO: A Drunken Perry Gibbons Gets a How's Your Father From\r\nRide-Bride Hilda Hammersen\r\n\r\nMADISON, WI: Say you managed to inspire some kind of \"movement\" of\r\ntechno-utopians who built a network of amusement park rides that guide\r\ntheir visitors through an illustrated history of the last dotcom\r\nbubble.\r\n\r\nSay that your merry band of unwashed polyamorous info-hippies was\r\novertaken by jackbooted thugs from one of the dinosauric media empires\r\nof yesteryear, whose legal machinations resulted in nationwide raids,\r\nbeatings, gassings, and the total shutdown of your \"movement.\"\r\n\r\nWhat would you do? Sue? Call a press-conference? Bail your loyal\r\nfollowers out of the slam?\r\n\r\nGet laid, get shitfaced, and let a bunch of students spitball bullshit\r\nideas for fighting back?\r\n\r\nIf you picked the latter, you're in good company. Last night, Perry\r\nGibbons, soi-disant \"founder\" of the rideafarian religious cult, was\r\nspotted out for drinks and cuddles with a group of twentysomething\r\nstudents in the backwater town of Madison, WI, a place better known\r\nfor its cheddar than its activism.\r\n\r\nWhile Gibbons regaled the impressionable post-adolescents with tales\r\nof his derring-do, he avidly noted their strategic suggestions for\r\nsolving his legal, paramilitary, and technical problems.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion that drew Gibbons's attention and admiration was to\r\napproach venture capitalists and beg them for the capital to sue\r\nDisney and then use the settlements from the suits to pay back the\r\nVCs.\r\n\r\nThis mind-croggling Ponzi scheme is the closest thing to a business\r\nmodel we've yet heard of from the chip-addled techno-hippies of the\r\nNew Work and its post-boom incarnation.\r\n\r\nOne can only imagine how our Ms Church will cover this in her\r\nfan-blog: breathless admiration for Mr Gibbons's cunning in soliciting\r\nyet more \"way out of the box\" thinking from the Junior Guevaras of the\r\nGreat Midwest, no doubt.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Gibbons can be afforded a little sympathy, though. His latest\r\nencounter with Florida law left him with a broken arm and it may be\r\nthat the pain medication is primarily responsible for Gibbons's fancy\r\nthinking. If that's the case, we can only hope that his young, blond\r\nScandie nursie will carefully minister him back to health (while his\r\ncomrades rot in gaol around the country).\r\n\r\nThis organization needs to die before it gets someone killed.\r\n\r\nComments? Write to Freddy at honestfred@techstink.co.uk\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nLester interrupted Suzanne's phone-call to break in and announce that\r\nhe'd run Rat-Toothed Freddy to ground: the reporter had caught the\r\nfirst flight from Madison to Chicago and then gone west to San\r\nJose. The TSA had flagged him as a person-of-interest and were\r\nwatching his movements, and a little digging on its website could\r\ncause it to disclose Freddy's every airborne movement.\r\n\r\nSuzanne relayed this to Perry.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you go there,\" she said. \"He's gunning for the San Francisco\r\ncrew, and he's hoping for a confrontation or a denunciation so that he\r\ncan print it. He gets idees fixes that he worries at like a terrier,\r\ngoing for more bile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he a psycho? What the hell is his beef with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that he thinks that technology hasn't lived up to its promise\r\nand that we should all be demanding better of our tech. So for him,\r\nthat means that anyone who actually *likes* technology is the enemy,\r\nthe worst villain, undermining the case for bringing tech up to its\r\ntrue potential.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fuck, that is so twisted.\"\r\n\r\n\"And given the kind of vile crap he writes, the only readers he has\r\nare nut-cases who get off on seeing people who are actually creating\r\nstuff flayed alive for their failures. They egg him on -- ever see one\r\nof his letters columns? If he changed to actual reportage, telling the\r\nbalanced stories of what was going on in the world, they'd jump ship\r\nfor some other hate-monger. He's a lightning-rod for assholes -- he's\r\nthe king of the trolls.\"\r\n\r\nPerry looked away. \"What do I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"You could try to starve him. If you don't show your head, he can't\r\nreport on you, except by making stuff up -- and made-up stuff gets\r\nboring, even for the kinds of losers who read his stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I've got work to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, yeah you do. Maybe you've just got to take your lumps. Every\r\ncomplex ecosystem has parasites after all. Maybe you just call up San\r\nFrancisco and brief them on what to expect from this guy and take it\r\nfrom there.\"\r\n\r\nOnce they were off the line, Lester came up behind her and hugged her\r\nat the waist, squeezing the little love-handles there, reminding her\r\nof how long it had been since she'd made it to yoga.\r\n\r\n\"You think that'll work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe. I've been talking to the *New Journalism Review* about writing\r\na piece on moral responsibility and paid journalism, and if I can bang\r\nit out this aft, I bet they'll publish it tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it'll distract him from Perry, maybe. It might get his employer\r\nto take a hard look at what he's writing -- I mean that piece is just\r\nlies, mischaracterizations, and editorial masquerading as reportage.\"\r\nShe put her lid down and paced around the condo, looking at the leaves\r\nfloating in the pool. \"It'll give me some satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nLester gave her a hug, and it smelled of the old days and the old\r\nLester, the giant, barrel-chested pre-fatkins Lester. It took her back\r\nto a simpler time, when they'd had to worry about commercial\r\ncompetition, not police raids.\r\n\r\nShe hugged him back. He was all hard muscle and zero body-fat\r\nunderneath his tight shirt. She'd never dated anyone that fit, not\r\neven back in high-school. It was a little disorienting, and it made\r\nher feel especially old and saggy sometimes, though he never seemed to\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, she felt his erection pressing against her midriff,\r\nand tried to hide her grin. \"Gimme a couple hours, all right?\"\r\n\r\nShe dialed the NJR editor's number as she slid into her chair and\r\npulled up a text-editor. She knew what she planned on writing, but it\r\nwould help to be able to share an outline with the NJR if she was\r\ngoing to get this out in good time. Working with editors was a pain\r\nafter years of writing for the blog, but sometimes you wanted someone\r\nelse's imprimatur on your work.\r\n\r\nFive hours later, the copy was filed. She rocked back in her chair and\r\nstretched her arms high over her head, listening to the crackle of her\r\nspine. She'd been half-frozen by the air conditioning, so she'd turned\r\nit off and opened a window, and now the condo was hot and muggy. She\r\nstripped down to her underwear and headed for the shower, but before\r\nshe could make it, she was intercepted by Lester.\r\n\r\nHe fell on her like a dog on dinner, and hours slipped by as they made\r\nthe apartment even muggier. Lester's athleticism in the sack was\r\nflattering, but sometimes boundless to the point of irritation. She\r\nwas rescued from it this time by the doorbell.\r\n\r\nLester put on a bathrobe and answered the door, and she heard the\r\nsounds of the family Kettlewell spilling in, the kids' little\r\nfootfalls pounding up and down the corridors. Hurriedly, Suzanne threw\r\non a robe and ducked across the corridor into the bathroom, but not\r\nbefore catching sight of Eva and Landon. Eva's expression was grimly\r\nsatisfied; Landon looked stricken. Fuck it, anyway. She'd never given\r\nhim any reason to hope, and he had no business hoping.\r\n\r\nHalfway through her shower, she heard someone moving around in the\r\nbathroom, and thinking it was Lester, she stuck her head around the\r\ncurtain, only to find Ada on the pot, little jeans around her\r\nankles. \"I hadda make,\" Ada said, with a shrug.\r\n\r\nChrist. What was she doing back here, anyway? She'd missed it all so\r\nmuch from Petersburg. But she hadn't really bargained for this. It was\r\nonly a matter of time until Tjan showed up too, surely they'd be\r\nwanting a council of war after Freddy's opening salvo.\r\n\r\nShe waited for the little girl to flush (ouch! hot water!) and got\r\ndressed as discreetly as possible.\r\n\r\nBy the time she got to the balcony where the council of war was under\r\nway, the two little girls, Lyenitchka and Ada, had gotten Pascal up on\r\nthe sofa and were playing dress up with him, hot-gluing Barbie heads\r\nto his cheeks and arms and chubby knees, like vacantly staring warts.\r\n\r\n\"Do you like him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he looks wonderful, girls. Is that glue OK for him, though?\"\r\n\r\nAda nodded vigorously. \"I've been gluing things to my brother with\r\nthat stuff forever. Dad says it's OK so long as I don't put it in his\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your dad's a smart man.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's in love with you,\" Lyenitchka said, and giggled. Ada slugged her\r\nin the arm.\r\n\r\n\"That's supposed to be a secret, stupid,\" Ada said.\r\n\r\nFlustered, Suzanne ducked out onto the patio and shut the door behind\r\nher. Eva and Tjan and Kettlewell all turned to look at her.\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne!\" Tjan said. \"Nice article.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it up already?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, just a couple minutes ago.\" Tjan held up his phone. \"I've got a\r\nwatch-list for anything to do with Freddy that gets a lot of link-love\r\nin a short period. Your piece rang the cherries.\"\r\n\r\nShe took the phone from him and looked at the list of links that had\r\nbeen found to the *NJR* piece. Three of the diggdots had picked up the\r\nstory, since they loved to report on anything that made fun of Freddy\r\n-- he was a frequent savager of their readers' cherished beliefs,\r\nafter all -- and thence it had wormed its way all around the net. In\r\nthe time she'd needed to take a shower, her story had been read by\r\nabout three million people. She felt a twinge of regret for not\r\npublishing it on her blog -- that would have been some serious\r\nadvertising coin.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there you have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose he'll come back with?\" Kettlewell said, then\r\nlooked uncomfortably at Eva. She pretended not to notice, and\r\ncontinued to stare at the grimy Hollywood palms, swimming pools and\r\nfreeways.\r\n\r\n\"Something nasty and full of lies, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nNerd Groupie Church Finds Fatkins Love with Ride Sidekick\r\n\r\nSources close to the Hollywood, Florida ride-cult have revealed that\r\nSuzanne Church, the celebrity blogger who helped inflate the New Work\r\nstock bubble, is in the midst of a romantic entanglement with one of\r\nthe cult's co-founders.\r\n\r\nChurch recently came out of retirement in St Petersburg, where she has\r\nbeen producing PR^H^H journalistic accounts of the new generation of\r\nRussian experimental plastic surgery butchers.\r\n\r\nChurch was lured back by the promise of a story about the ride-network\r\nthat was founded by her old pals from the New Work pump-and-dump,\r\nLester Banks and Perry Gibbons. Now on the scene are more familiar\r\nfaces: Landon Kettlewell, the disgraced former CEO of Kodacell, and\r\nTjan Tang, the former business manager of the Banks/Gibbons scam.\r\n\r\nBut not long after arriving on the scene, Church fell in with Banks,\r\nan early fatkins and stalwart of the New Work movement, a technologist\r\nwho entranced his fellow engineers with his accounts of the New Work's\r\nmany \"inventions\" -- prompting one message-board commenter to\r\ncharacterize him as \"a cross between Steve Wozniak and the Reverend\r\nSun Myung Moon.\"\r\n\r\nNow, eyewitness accounts have them going at it like shagging marmots,\r\nas the bio-enhanced Banks falls on Church's wrinkly carcass half a\r\ndozen times a day, apparently consummating a romance that blossomed\r\nwhile Banks was, to put it bluntly, a giant fat bastard. It seems that\r\nradical weight-loss has put Banks into the category of \"blokes that\r\nSuzanne Church is willing to play hide the sausage with.\"\r\n\r\nAll this would be mere sordid gossip but for the fact that Church is\r\nonce again glowingly chronicling the adventures of the Florida\r\ncultists, playing journalist, without a shred of impartiality or\r\ndisclosure.\r\n\r\nOne can only imagine when the other, financial shoe will drop. For\r\nwherever Church goes, money isn't far behind: surely there's a\r\nfinancial aspect to this business with the ride.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nIndeed there is: further anonymous tipsterism reveals that papers have\r\nbeen filed to create a \"co-operative\" structured like a classic Ponzi\r\nscheme, in which franchise operators of the ride are expected to pay\r\nmembership dues further up the ladder. All the romance of Church's\r\naccounts will certainly find a fresh batch of suckers -- if there's\r\none thing we know about Suzanne Church, it's that she knows how to\r\nseparate a mark from his money.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nLester ran the ride basically on his own that week, missing his\r\nworkshop and his tinkering, thinking of Suzanne, wishing that Perry\r\nwas back already. He wasn't exactly a people person, and there were a\r\n*lot* of people.\r\n\r\n\"I brought some stuff,\" the goth kid said as he paid for his ticket,\r\nhefting two huge duffel bags. \"That's still OK, right?\"\r\n\r\nWas it? Damned if Lester knew. The kid had a huge bruise covering half\r\nof his face, and Lester thought he recognized him from the showdown --\r\nDeath Waits, that's what Perry had said.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, it's fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're Lester, right?\"\r\n\r\nChrist, another one.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honest Fred is full of shit. I've been reading your posts since\r\nforever. That guy is just jealous because your girlfriend outed him\r\nfor being such a lying asshole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah.\" Death Waits wasn't the first one to say words to this effect\r\n-- Suzanne had had that honor -- and he wouldn't be the last. But\r\nLester wanted to forget it. He'd liked the moments of fame he'd gained\r\nfrom Suzanne's writing, from his work on the message boards. He'd even\r\nhad a couple of fanboys show up to do a little interview for their\r\npodcast about his mechanical computer. That had been nice. But \"blokes\r\nthat Suzanne Church is willing to play hide the sausage with\" -- ugh.\r\n\r\nSuzanne was holding it together as far as he could tell. But she\r\ndidn't seem as willing to stick her neck out to broker little peaces\r\nbetween Tjan and Kettlewell anymore, and those two were going at it\r\nhammer and tongs now, each convinced that he was in charge. Tjan\r\nreasoned that since he actually ran one of the most-developed rides in\r\nthe network that he should be the executive, with Kettlewell as a\r\ntrusted adviser. Kettlewell clearly felt that he deserved the crown\r\nbecause he'd actually run global businesses, as opposed to Tjan, who\r\nwas little more than a middle manager.\r\n\r\nNeither had said exactly that, but that was only because whenever they\r\nheaded down that path, Suzanne interposed herself and distracted them.\r\n\r\nNo one asked Lester or Perry, even though they were the ones who'd\r\ninvented it all. It was all so fucked up. Why couldn't he just make\r\nstuff and do stuff? Why did it always have to turn into a plan for\r\nworld domination? In Lester's experience, most world-domination plans\r\nwent sour, while a hefty proportion of modest plans to Make Something\r\nCool actually worked out pretty well, paid the bills, and put food on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nThe goth kid looked expectantly at him. \"I'm a huge fan, you know. I\r\nused to work for Disney, and I was always watching what you did to get\r\nideas for new stuff we should do. That's why it's so totally suckballs\r\nthat they're accusing you of ripping them off -- we rip you off all\r\nthe time.\"\r\n\r\nLester felt like he was expected to do something with that information\r\n-- maybe deliver it to some lawyer or whatever. But would it make a\r\ndifference? He couldn't get any spit in his mouth over legal\r\nfights. Christ -- legal fights!\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. You're Death Waits, right? Perry told me about you.\"\r\n\r\nThe kid visibly swelled. \"Yeah. I could help around here if you\r\nwanted, you know. I know a lot about ride-operating. I used to train\r\nthe ride-runners at Disney, and I could work any position. If you\r\nwanted.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're not really hiring --\" Lester began.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not looking for a job. I could just, you know, help. I don't have\r\na job or anything right now.\"\r\n\r\nLester needed to pee. And he was sick of sitting here taking people's\r\nmoney. And he wanted to go play with his mechanical computer, anyway.\r\n\r\n\"Lester? Who's the kid taking ticket money?\" Suzanne's hug was sweaty\r\nand smelled good.\r\n\r\n\"Look at this,\" Lester said. He flipped up his magnifying goggles and\r\nhanded her the soda can. He'd cut away a panel covering the whole\r\nfront of the can, and inside he'd painstakingly assembled sixty-four\r\nflip-flops. He turned the crank on the back of the can slowly, and the\r\ncorrect combination of rods extended from the back of the can,\r\nindicating the values represented on the flip-flops within. \"It's a\r\nsixty-four bit register. We could build a shitkicking Pentium out of a\r\ncouple million of these.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned the crank again. The can smelled of solder and it had a\r\npleasant weight in his hand. The mill beside him hummed, and on his\r\nscreen, the parts he'd CADded up rotated in wireframe. Suzanne was at\r\nhis side and he'd just built something completely teh awesome. He'd\r\ntaken his shirt off somewhere along the afternoon's lazy, warm way and\r\nhis skin prickled with a breeze.\r\n\r\nHe turned to take Suzanne in his arms. God he loved her. He'd been in\r\nlove with her for years now and she was his.\r\n\r\n\"Look at how cool this thing is, just look.\" He used a tweezer to\r\nchange the registers again and gave it a little crank. \"I got the idea\r\nfrom the old Princeton Institute Electronic Computer Project. All\r\nthese geniuses, von Neumann and Dyson, they brought in their kids for\r\nthe summer to wind all the cores they'd need for their RAM. Millions\r\nof these things, wound by the kids of the smartest people in the\r\nuniverse. What a cool way to spend your summer.\r\n\r\n\"So I thought I'd prototype the next generation of these, a 64-bit\r\nversion that you could build out of garbage. Get a couple hundred of\r\nthe local kids in for the summer and get them working. Get them to\r\nunderstand just how these things work -- that's the problem with\r\nintegrated circuits, you can't take them apart and see how they\r\nwork. How are we going to get another generation of tinkerers unless\r\nwe get kids interested in how stuff works?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's the kid taking ticket money?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a fan, that kid that Perry met in jail. Death Waits. The one who\r\nbrought in the Disney stuff.\"\r\n\r\nHe gradually became aware that Suzanne was rigid and shaking in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\"\r\n\r\nHer face was purple now, her hands clenched into fists. \"What's wrong?\r\nLester, what's wrong? You've left a total stranger, who, by his own\r\nadmission, is a recently terminated employee of a company that is\r\ntrying to bankrupt you and put you in jail. You've left him in charge\r\nof an expensive, important capital investment, and given him the\r\nauthority to collect money on your behalf. Do you really need to ask\r\nme what's wrong?\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to smile. \"It's OK, it's OK, he's only --\"\r\n\r\n\"Only what? Only your possible doom? Christ, Perry, you don't even\r\nhave fucking *insurance* on that business.\"\r\n\r\nDid she just call him Perry? He carefully set down the Coke can and\r\nlooked at her.\r\n\r\n\"I'm down here busting my *ass* for you two, fighting cops, letting\r\nthat shit Freddy smear my name all over the net, and what the hell are\r\nyou doing to save yourself? You're in here playing with Coke cans!\"\r\nShe picked it up and shook it. He heard the works inside rattling and\r\nflinched towards it. She jerked it out of his reach and threw it,\r\n*threw it* hard at the wall. Hundreds of little gears and ratchets and\r\nrods spilled out of it.\r\n\r\n\"Fine, Lester, fine. You go on being an emotional ten-year-old. But\r\nstop roping other people into this. You've got people all over the\r\ncountry depending on you and you are just *abdicating* your\r\nresponsibility to them. I won't be a part of it.\" She was crying\r\nnow. Lester had no idea what to say now.\r\n\r\n\"It's not enough that Perry's off chasing pussy, you've got to pick\r\nthis moment to take French leave to play with your toys. Christ, the\r\nwhole bunch of you deserve each other.\"\r\n\r\nLester knew that he was on the verge of shouting at her, really\r\ntearing into her, saying unforgivable things. He'd been there before\r\nwith other friends, and no good ever came of it. He wanted to tell her\r\nthat he'd never asked for the responsibility, that he'd lived up to it\r\nanyway, that no one had asked her to put her neck on the line and it\r\nwasn't fair to blame him for the shit that Freddy was putting her\r\nthrough. He wanted to tell her that if she was in love with Perry, she\r\nshould be sleeping with Perry, and not him. He wanted to tell her that\r\nshe had no business reaming him out for doing what he'd always done:\r\nsit in his workshop.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to tell her that she had never once seen him as a sexual\r\nbeing when he was big and fat, but that he had no trouble seeing her\r\nas one now that she was getting old and a little saggy, and so where\r\ndid she get off criticizing his emotional maturity?\r\n\r\nHe wanted to say all of this, and he wanted to take back his 64-bit\r\nregister and nurse it back to health. He'd been in a luminous creative\r\nfog when he'd built that can, and who knew if he'd be able to\r\nreconstruct it?\r\n\r\nHe wanted to cry, to blubber at her for the monumental unfairness of\r\nit all. He stood stiffly up from his workbench and turned on his heel\r\nand walked out. He expected Suzanne to call out to him, but she\r\ndidn't. He didn't care, or at least he didn't want to.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSammy skipped three consecutive Theme-Leaders' meetings, despite\r\nincreasingly desperate requests for his presence. The legal team was\r\neating every spare moment he had, and he hadn't been able to get\r\naudience research to get busy on his fatkins project. Now he was\r\nbehind schedule -- not surprising, given that he'd pulled his schedule\r\nout of his ass to shut up Wiener and co -- and dealing with lawyers\r\nwas making him crazy.\r\n\r\nAnd to top it all off, the goddamned rides were back up and running.\r\n\r\nSo the last thing he wanted was a visit from Wiener.\r\n\r\n\"They're suing us, you know. They raised *venture capital* to sue us,\r\nbecause we have such deep pockets. You know that, Sammy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, Wiener. People sue us all the time. Venture capitalists\r\nhave deep pockets, too, you know -- when we win, we'll take them to\r\nthe cleaners. Christ, why am I having this conversation with you?\r\nDon't you have something productive to do? Is Tomorrowland so fucking\r\n*perfect* that you've come around to help me with my little projects?\"\r\n\r\n\"Someone's a little touchy today,\" Wiener said, wagging a finger. \"I\r\njust wanted to see if you wanted some help coming up with a strategy\r\nfor getting out of this catastrophe, but since you mention it, I *do*\r\nhave work I could be doing. I'll see you at the next Theme-Leaders'\r\nmeeting, Sam. Missing three is grounds for disciplinary action, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nSammy sat back in his chair and looked coolly at Wiener. Threats\r\nnow. Disciplinary action. He kept on his best poker face, looking past\r\nWiener's shoulder (a favorite trick for staring down adversaries --\r\njust don't meet their eyes). In his peripheral vision, he saw Wiener\r\nwilt, look away and then turn and leave the room.\r\n\r\nHe waited until the door had shut, then slumped in his seat and put\r\nhis face in his hands. God, and shit, and damn. How did it all go so\r\ncrapola? How did he end up with a theme-area that was half-shut,\r\nrecord absenteeism, and even a goddamned *union organizer* just the\r\nday before, whom he'd had to have security remove. Florida laws being\r\nwhat they were, it was a rare organizer brave enough to try to come on\r\nan employer's actual premises to do his dirty work, no one wanted a\r\ntwo-year rap without parole for criminal trespass and interference\r\nwith trade. The kid had been young, about the same age as Death Waits\r\nand the castmembers, and had clearly been desperate to collect his\r\nbounty from SEIU. He'd gone hard, struggling and kicking, shouting\r\nslogans at the wide-eyed castmembers and few guests who watched him go\r\naway.\r\n\r\nHaving him taken away had given Sammy a sick feeling. They hadn't had\r\none of those vultures on the premises in three years, and never on\r\nSammy's turf.\r\n\r\nWhat next, what next? How much worse could it get?\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Sammy.\" Hackelberg wasn't the head of the legal department, but\r\nhe was as high up in the shadowy organization as Sammy ever hoped to\r\nmeet. He was old and leathery, the way that natives to the Sunbelt\r\ncould be. He loved to affect ice-cream suits and had even been known\r\nto carry a cane. When he was in casual conversation, he talked\r\n\"normal\" -- like a Yankee newscaster. But the more serious he got, the\r\ndeeper and thicker his drawl got. Sammy never once believed that this\r\nwas accidental. Hackelberg was as premeditated as they came.\r\n\r\n\"I was just about to come over and see you,\" Sammy lied. Whatever\r\nproblem had brought Hackelberg down to his office, it would be better\r\nto seem as though he was already on top of it.\r\n\r\n\"I expect you were.\" *Were* came out *Wuh* -- when the drawl got that\r\nfar into the swamps that quickly, disaster was on the\r\nhorizon. Hackelberg let the phrase hang there.\r\n\r\nSammy sweated. He was good at this game, but Hackelberg was\r\nbetter. Entertainment lawyers were like fucking vampires, evil\r\nembodied. He looked down at his desk.\r\n\r\n\"Sammy. They're coming back after us --\" *They-ah comin' back aft-ah\r\nus*. \"Those ride people. They did what we thought they'd do,\r\nincorporating into a single entity that we can sue once and kill for\r\ngood, but then they did something else. Do you know what they did,\r\nSammy?\"\r\n\r\nSammy nodded. \"They're countersuing. We knew they'd do that, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"We didn't expect they'd raise a war-chest like the one they've pulled\r\ntogether. They have a *business-plan* built around suing us for the\r\nnext fifteen years, Sammy. They're practically ready to float an\r\nIPO. Have you seen this?\" He handed Sammy a hardcopy of a chic little\r\ninvestment newsletter that was so expensive to subscribe to that he'd\r\nsuspected until now that it might just be a rumor.\r\n\r\nHOW DO YOU GET RID(E) OF A BILLION?\r\n\r\nThe Kodacell experiment recognized one fundamental truth: it's easy to\r\nturn ten thousand into two hundred thousand, but much harder to turn\r\nten million into two hundred million. Scaling an investment up to\r\ngigascale is so hard, it's nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nBut a new paradigm in investment that's unfolding around us that might\r\nactually solve the problem: venture-financed litigation. Twenty or\r\nthirty million sunk into litigation can bankrupt a twenty\r\nbillion-dollar firm, transferring to the investors whatever assets\r\nremain after legal fees.\r\n\r\nIt sounds crazy, and only time will tell whether it proves to be\r\nsustainable. But the founder of the strategy, Landon Kettlewell, has\r\nstruck gold for his investors more than once -- witness the legendary\r\nrise and fall of Kodacell, the entity that emerged from the merger of\r\nKodak and Duracell. Investors in the first two rounds and the IPO on\r\nKodacell brought home 30X returns in three years (of course, investors\r\nwho stayed in too long came away with nothing).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Kettlewell's bid to take down Disney Parks looks good --\r\nthe legal analysis of the vexatious litigation and unfair competition\r\ncharges have legal scholars arguing and adding up the zeros. Most\r\ndamning is the number of former Disney Parks employees (or\r\n\"castmembers\" in the treacly dialect of the Magic Kingdom) who've\r\nposted information about the company's long-term plan to sabotage\r\nKettlewell's clients.\r\n\r\nLikewise fascinating is the question of whether the jury will be able\r\nto distinguish between Disney Parks, whose corporate citizenship is\r\nactually pretty good, from Disney Products, whose record has been\r\ntainted by a string of disastrous child-labor, safety, and design\r\nflaws (astute readers will be thinking of the \"flammable pajamas\" flap\r\nof last year, and CEO Robert Montague's memorable words, \"Parents who\r\ncan't keep their kids away from matches have no business complaining\r\nabout *our* irresponsibility\"). Punitive jury awards are a wild-card\r\nin this kind of litigation, but given the trends in recent years,\r\nthings look bad for Disney Parks.\r\n\r\nBottom line: should your portfolio include a litigation-investment\r\ncomponent? Yes, unequivocally. While risky and slow to mature,\r\nlitigation-investments promise a staggering return on investment not\r\nseen in decades. A million or two carefully placed with the right\r\nlitigation fund could pay off enough to make it all worthwhile. This\r\nis creative destruction at its finest: the old dinosaurs like Disney\r\nParks are like rich seams of locked-away capital begging to be\r\nliquidated and put to work at nimbler firms.\r\n\r\nHow can you tell if you've got the right fund? Come back next week,\r\nwhen we'll have a Q&A with a litigation specialist at Credit\r\nSuisse/First Boston.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\n\"There's litigation specialists at Credit Suisse?\"\r\n\r\nHe was big, Hackelberg, though he often gave the impression of being\r\nsmaller through his habitual slouch. But when he pulled himself up, it\r\nwas like a string in the center of the top of his head was holding him\r\nerect, like he was hovering off the ground, like he was about to leap\r\nacross the desk and go for your throat. His lower jaw rocked from side\r\nto side.\r\n\r\n\"They do now, Sammy. Every investment bank has one, including the one\r\nthat the chairman of our board is a majority shareholder in.\"\r\n\r\nSammy swallowed. \"But they've got just as deep pockets as we do --\r\ncan't we just fight these battles out and take the money off of them\r\nwhen we win?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we win.\"\r\n\r\nSammy saw his opportunity to shift the blame. \"If we've been acting on\r\ngood legal advice, why wouldn't we win?\"\r\n\r\nHackelberg inhaled slowly, his chest filling and filling until his\r\nice-cream suit looked like it might pop. His jaw clicked from side to\r\nside. But he didn't say anything. Sammy tried to meet that cool gaze,\r\nbut he couldn't out-stare the man. The silence stretched. Sammy got\r\nthe message: this was not a problem that originated in the legal\r\ndepartment. This was a problem that originated with him.\r\n\r\nHe looked away.  \"How do we solve this?\"\r\n\r\n\"We need to raise the cost of litigation, Samuel. The only reason this\r\nis viable is that it's cost-effective to sue us. When we raise the\r\ncost of litigation, we reduce its profitability.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do we raise the cost of litigation?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a fertile imagination, Sammy. I have no doubt that you will\r\nbe able to conceive of innumerable means of accomplishing this goal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you do. I really hope you do. Because we have an alternative\r\nto raising the cost of litigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"We could sacrifice an employee or two.\"\r\n\r\nSammy picked up his water-glass and discovered that it was empty. He\r\nturned away from his desk to refill it from his filter and when he\r\nturned back, the lawyer had gone. His mouth was dry as cotton and his\r\nhands were shaking.\r\n\r\nRaise the cost of litigation, huh?\r\n\r\nHe grabbed his laptop. There were ways to establish anonymous email\r\naccounts, but he didn't know them. Figuring that out would take up the\r\nrest of the afternoon, he realized, as he called up a couple of FAQs.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a career as varied and ambitious as Sammy's, it was\r\noften the case that you ran across an email address for someone you\r\nnever planned on contacting, but you never knew, and a wise planner\r\nmakes space for lots of outlier contingencies.\r\n\r\nSammy hadn't written down these email addresses. He'd committed them\r\nto memory.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDeath Waits was living the dream. He took people's money and directed\r\nthem to the ride's entrance, making them feel welcome, talking ride\r\ntrivia. Some of his pals spotted him at the desk and enviously\r\ndemanded to know how he came to be sitting on the other side of the\r\nwicket, and he told them the incredible story of the fatkins who'd\r\nsimply handed over the reins.\r\n\r\nThis, this was how you ran a ride. None of that artificial gloopy\r\nsweetness that defined the Disney experience: instead, you got a\r\npersonal, informal, human-scale experience. Chat people up, find out\r\ntheir hopes and dreams, make admiring noises at the artifacts they'd\r\nbrought to add to the ride, kibbitz about where they might place\r\nthem....\r\n\r\nAround him, the bark of the vendors. One of them, an old lady in a\r\nblinding white sun-dress, came by to ask him if he wanted anything\r\nfrom the coffee-cart.\r\n\r\nThere had been a time, those first days when they'd rebuilt\r\nFantasyland, when he'd really felt like he was part of the magic. No,\r\nThe Magic, with capital letters. Something about the shared experience\r\nof going to a place with people and having an experience with them,\r\nthat was special. It must be why people went to church. Not that\r\nDisney had been a religion for him, exactly. But when he watched the\r\npark he'd grown up attending take on the trappings that adorned his\r\nfavorite clubs, his favorite movies and games -- man, it had been a\r\npiece of magic.\r\n\r\nAnd to be a part of it. To be an altar boy, if not a priest, in that\r\nmagical cathedral they'd all built together in Orlando!\r\n\r\nBut it hadn't been real. He could see that now.\r\n\r\nAt Disney, Death Waits had been a customer, and then an employee\r\n(\"castmember\" -- he corrected himself reflexively). What he wanted,\r\nthough, was to be a *citizen*. A citizen of The Magic -- which wasn't\r\na Magic Kingdom, since kingdoms didn't have citizens, they had\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nHe started to worry about whether he was going to get a lunch break by\r\nabout two, and by three he was starving. Luckily that's when Lester\r\ncame back. He thanked Death profusely, which was nice, but he didn't\r\nask Death to come back the next day.\r\n\r\n\"Um, when can I come back and do this some more?\"\r\n\r\n\"You *want* to do this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you that this morning -- I love it. I'm good at it, too.\"\r\n\r\nLester appeared to think it over. \"I don't know, man. I kind of put\r\nyou in the hot-seat today, but I don't really have the authority to do\r\nit. I could get into trouble --\"\r\n\r\nDeath waved him off. \"Don't sweat it, then,\" he said with as much\r\nchirp as he could muster, which was precious fucking little. He felt\r\nlike his heart was breaking. It was worse than when he'd finally asked\r\nout a co-worker who'd worked the Pinocchio Village Haus and she had\r\nher looked so horrified that he'd made a joke out of it, worried about\r\na sexual harassment complaint.\r\n\r\nLester clearly caught some of that, for he thought some more and then\r\nwaved his hands. \"Screw her anyway. Meet me here at ten\r\ntomorrow. You're in.\"\r\n\r\nDeath wasn't sure he'd heard him right. \"You're kidding.\"\r\n\r\n\"No man, you want it, you got it. You're good at it, like you said.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy -- thanks. Thank you so much. I mean it. Thank you!\" He made\r\nhimself stop blithering. \"Nice to meet you,\" he said finally. \"Have a\r\ngreat evening!\" Yowch. He was speaking castmemberese. *Nice one,\r\nDarren*.\r\n\r\nHe'd saved enough out of his wages from his first year at Disney to\r\nbuy a little Shell electric two-seater, and then he'd gone way into\r\ndebt buying kits to mod it to look like a Big Daddy Roth\r\ncoffin-dragster. The car sat alone at the edge of the lot. Around him,\r\na slow procession of stall-operators, with their arms full, headed for\r\nthe freeway and across to the shantytown.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he nursed his embarrassment and tried to take comfort in\r\nthe attention that his gleaming, modded car evinced. He loved the\r\ndecorative spoilers, the huge rear tires, the shining muffler-pipes\r\nrunning alongside the bulging running-boards. He stepped in and\r\ngripped the bat-shaped gearshift, adjusted the headstone-shaped\r\nheadrest, and got rolling. It was a long drive back home to Melbourne,\r\nand he was reeling from the day's events. He wished he'd gotten\r\nsomeone to snap a pic of him at the counter. Shit.\r\n\r\nHe pulled off at a filling station after a couple hours. He needed a\r\npiss and something with guarana if he was going to make it the rest of\r\nthe way home. It was all shut down, but the automat was still open. He\r\nstood before the giant, wall-sized glassed-in refrigerator and\r\ndithered over the energy-drinks. There were chocolate ones, salty\r\nones, colas and cream sodas, but a friend had texted him a picture of\r\na semi-legal yogurt smoothie with taurine and modafinil that sounded\r\nreally good.\r\n\r\nHe spotted it and reached to tap on the glass and order it just as the\r\nfat guy came up beside him. Fat guys were rare in the era of fatkins,\r\nit was practically a fashion-statement to be chunky, but this guy\r\nwasn't fashionable. He had onion-breath that Death could smell even\r\nbefore he opened his mouth, and he was wearing a greasy windbreaker\r\nand baggy jeans. He had a comb-over and needed a shave.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell are you supposed to be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not anything,\" Death Waits said. He was used to shit-kickers and\r\ntourists gawping at his shock of black hair with its viridian green\r\nhighlights, his white face-paint and eyeliner, his contact lenses that\r\nmade his whole eyes into zombie-white cue-balls. You just had to\r\nignore them.\r\n\r\n\"You don't look like nothing to me. You look like something. Something\r\nyou'd dress up a six year old as for Halloween. I mean, what the\r\nfuck?\" He was talking quietly and without rancor, but he had a vibe\r\nlike a basher. He must have arrived at the deserted rest-stop while\r\nDeath Waits was having a piss.\r\n\r\nDeath Waits looked around for a security cam. These rest-stops always\r\nhad a license-plate cam at the entrance and a couple of anti-stickup\r\ncams around the cashier. He spotted the camera. Someone had hung a\r\nbaseball hat over its lens.\r\n\r\nHe felt his balls draw up toward his abdomen and his breathing\r\nquicken. This guy was going to fucking mug him. Shit shit shit. Maybe\r\ntake his *car*.\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" Death said, \"nice talking to you.\" He tried to step around the\r\nguy, but he side-stepped to block Death's path, then put a hand on\r\nDeath's shoulder -- it was strong. Death had been mugged once before,\r\nbut the guy hadn't touched him; he'd just told him, fast and mean, to\r\nhand over his wallet and phone and then had split.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not done,\" the guy said.\r\n\r\n\"Look, take my wallet, I don't want any trouble.\" Apart from two\r\nglorious sucker-punches at Sammy, Death had never thrown a punch, not\r\nsince he'd flunked out of karate lessons at the local strip-mall when\r\nhe was twelve. He liked to dance and he could run a couple miles\r\nwithout getting winded, but he'd seen enough real fights to know that\r\nit was better to get away than to try to strike out if you didn't know\r\nwhat you were doing.\r\n\r\n\"You don't want any trouble, huh?\"\r\n\r\nDeath held out his wallet. He could cancel the cards. Losing the cash\r\nwould hurt now that he didn't have a day-job, but it was better than\r\nlosing his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe guy smiled. His onion breath was terrible.\r\n\r\n\"*I* want trouble.\" Without any pre-amble or wind-up, the guy took\r\nhold of the earring that Death wore in his tragus, the little knob of\r\ncartilage on the inside of his ear, and briskly tore it out of Death's\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nIt was so sudden, the pain didn't come at once. What came first was a\r\nnumb feeling, the blood draining out of his cheeks and the color\r\ndraining out of the world, and his brain double- and triple-checking\r\nwhat had just happened. *Did someone just tear a piece out of my ear?\r\nTear? Ear?*\r\n\r\nThen the pain roared in, all of his senses leaping to keen awareness\r\nbefore maxing out completely. He heard a crashing sound like the surf,\r\nsmelled something burning, a light appeared before his eyes, an acrid\r\ntaste flooded his mouth and his ear felt like there was a hot coal\r\nnestled in it, charring the flesh.\r\n\r\nWith pain came the plan: *get the fuck out of there*. He took a step\r\nback and turned to run, but there was something tangled in his feet --\r\nthe guy had bridged the distance between them quickly, very quickly,\r\nand had hooked a foot around his ankle. He was going to fall over. He\r\nlanded in a runner's crouch and tried to start running, but a boot\r\ncaught him in the butt, like an old-timey comedy moment, and he went\r\nsprawling, his chin smacking into the pavement, his teeth clacking\r\ntogether with a sound that echoed in his head.\r\n\r\n\"Get the fuck up,\" the guy said. He was panting a little, sounding\r\nexcited. That sound was the scariest thing so far. This guy wanted to\r\nkill him. He could hear that. He was some kind of truck-stop murderer.\r\n\r\nDeath's fingers were encrusted in heavy silver rings -- stylized\r\nskulls, a staring eyeball, a coffin-shaped poisoner's ring that he\r\nsometimes kept artificial sweetener in, an ankh, an alien head with\r\ninsectile eyes -- and he balled his hands into fists, thinking of\r\neverything he'd ever read about throwing a punch without breaking your\r\nknuckles. *Get close. Keep your fist tight, thumb outside. Don't wind\r\nup or he'll see it coming.*\r\n\r\nHe slowly turned over. The guy's eyes were in shadow. His belly heaved\r\nwith each excited pant. From this angle, Death could see the guy had a\r\ngigantic boner. The thought of what that might bode sent him into\r\noverdrive. He couldn't afford to let this guy beat him up.\r\n\r\nHe backed up to the rail that lined the walkway and pulled himself\r\nupright. He cowered in on himself as much as he could, hoping that the\r\nguy would close with him, so he could get in one good punch. He\r\nmuttered indistinctly, softly, hoping to make the man lean in. His\r\nring-encrusted hands gripped the railings.\r\n\r\nThe guy took a step toward him. His lips were wet, his eyes shone. He\r\nhad a hand in his pocket and Death realized that getting his attacker\r\nclose in wouldn't be smart if he had a knife.\r\n\r\nThe hand came out. It was pudgy and stub-fingered, and the fingernails\r\nwere all gnawed down to the quick. Death looked at\r\nit. Spray-can. Pepper-spray? Mace? He didn't wait to find out. He\r\nlaunched himself off the railing at the fat man, going for his wet,\r\nwhistling cave of a mouth.\r\n\r\nThe man nodded as he came for him and let him paste one on\r\nhim. Death's rings drew blood on the fat cheek and rocked the guy's\r\nhead back a bit. The man stepped back and armed away the blood with\r\nhis sleeve. Death was running for his car, hand digging into his\r\npocket for his phone. He managed to get the phone out and his hand on\r\nthe door handle before the fat man caught up, breathing heavily, air\r\nwhistling through his nose.\r\n\r\nHe punched Death in the mouth in a vastly superior rendition of\r\nDeath's sole brave blow, a punch so hard Death's neck made a crackling\r\nsound as his head rocked away, slamming off the car's frame, ringing\r\nlike a gong. Death began to slide down the car's door, and only\r\nmanaged to turn his face slightly when the man sprayed him with his\r\nlittle aerosol can.\r\n\r\nMace. Death's breath stopped in his lungs and his face felt as if he'd\r\nplunged it into boiling oil. His eyes felt worse, like dirty fingers\r\nwere sandpapering over his eyeballs. He choked and fell over and heard\r\nthe man laugh.\r\n\r\nThen a boot caught him in the stomach and while he was doubled over,\r\nit came down again on his skinny shin. The sound of the bone breaking\r\nwas loud enough to be heard over the roaring of the blood in his\r\nears. He managed to suck in a lungful of air and scream it out, and\r\nthe boot connected with his mouth, kicking him hard and making him\r\nbite his tongue. Blood filled his mouth.\r\n\r\nA rough hand seized him by the hair and the rasping breath was in his\r\nears.\r\n\r\n\"You should just shut the fuck up about Disney on the fucking\r\nInternet, you know that, kid?\"\r\n\r\nThe man slammed his head against the pavement.\r\n\r\n\"Just. Shut. The. Fuck. Up.\" Bang, bang, bang. Death thought he'd lose\r\nconsciousness soon -- he'd had no idea that pain could be this\r\nintense. But he didn't lose consciousness for a long, long time. And\r\nthe pain could be a lot more intense, as it turned out.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSammy didn't want the writer meeting him at his office. His\r\norganization had lots of people who'd been loyal to the old gothy park\r\nand even to Death Waits. They plotted against him. They wrote about\r\nhim on the fucking Internet, reporting on what he'd eaten for lunch\r\nand who'd shouted at him in his office and how the numbers were\r\ndeclining and how none of the design crews wanted to work on his new\r\nrides.\r\n\r\nThe writer couldn't come to the office -- couldn't come within miles\r\nof the park. In fact, if Sammy had had his way, they would have done\r\nthis all by phone, but when he'd emailed the writer, he'd said that he\r\nwas in Florida already and would be happy to come and meet up.\r\n\r\nOf course he was in Florida -- he was covering the ride.\r\n\r\nThe trick was to find a place where no one, but no one, from work\r\nwould go. That meant going as touristy as possible -- something\r\noverpriced and kitschy.\r\n\r\nCamelot was just the place. It had once been a demolition derby\r\nstadium, and then had done turns as a skate-park, a dance-club and a\r\ndiscount wicker furniture outlet. Now it was Orlando's number two\r\nArthurian-themed dining experience, catering to package-holiday\r\nconsolidators who needed somewhere to fill the gullets of their\r\nbusloads of tourists. Watching men in armor joust at low speed on\r\nglue-factory nags took care of an evening's worth of entertainment,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nSammy parked between two giant air-conditioned tour coaches, then made\r\nhis way to the entrance. He'd told the guy what he looked like, and\r\nthe guy had responded with an obvious publicity shot that made him\r\nlook like Puck from a boys'-school performance of *A Midsummer Night's\r\nDream* -- unruly hair, mischievous grin.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned up, though, he was ten years older, a cigarette jammed\r\nin the yellowing crooked stumps of his teeth. He needed a shower and\r\nthere was egg on the front of his denim jacket.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Sammy,\" Sammy said. \"You must be Freddy.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy spat the cigarette to one side and shook with him. The writer's\r\npalms were clammy and wet.\r\n\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you,\" Freddy said. \"Camelot, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Taste of home for you, I expect,\" Sammy said. \"Tally ho. Pip pip.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy scrunched his face up in an elaborate sneer. \"You are joking,\r\nright?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm joking. If I wanted to give you a taste of home, I'd have invited\r\nyou to the Rose and Crown Pub in Epcot: 'Have a jolly ol' good time at\r\nthe Rose and Crown!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Still joking, I trust?\"\r\n\r\n\"Still joking,\" Sammy said. \"This place does a decent roast beef, and\r\nit's private enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Private in the sense of full of screaming stupid tourists stuffing\r\ntheir faces?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\" Sammy took a step toward the automatic doors.\r\n\r\n\"Before we go in, though,\" Freddy said. \"Before we go in. Why are you\r\ntalking to me at all, Mr Disney Parks Executive?\"\r\n\r\nHe was ready for this one. \"I figured that sooner or later you'd want\r\nto know more about this end of the story that you've been covering. I\r\nfigured it was in my employer's best interest to see to it that you\r\ngot my version.\"\r\n\r\nThe reporter's grin was wet and mean. \"I thought it was something like\r\nthat. You understand that I'm going to write this the way I see it,\r\nnot the way you spin it, right?\"\r\n\r\nSammy put a hand on his heart. \"Of course. I never would have asked\r\nanything less of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe reporter nodded and stepped inside the air-conditioned,\r\nhorsey-smelling depths of Camelot. The greeter had acne and a pair of\r\ntights that showed off his skinny knock-knees. He took off his great\r\npeaked cap with its long plume and made a stiff little\r\nbow. \"Greetings, milords, to Camelot. Yon feast awaits, and our brave\r\nknights stand ready to do battle for their honor and your amusement.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy rolled his eyes at Sammy, but Sammy made a little scooting\r\ngesture and handed the greeter their tickets, which were ringside. If\r\nhe was going to go to a place like Camelot, he could at least get the\r\nbest seats in the house.\r\n\r\nThey settled in and let the serving wench -- whose fancy contact\r\nlenses, piercings, and electric blue pony-tails were seriously\r\noff-theme -- take their roast beef orders and serve them gigantic\r\npewter tankards of \"ale\"; Bud Light, and the logo was stamped into the\r\nsides of the tankards.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me your story, then,\" Freddy said. The tourists around them were\r\nnoisy and already a little drunk, their conversation loud to be heard\r\nover the looping soundtrack of ren faire polka music.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know how much you know about the new Disney Parks\r\norganization. A lot of people think of us as being just another\r\nsubsidiary of the Mouse, like back in the old days. But since the IPO,\r\nwe're our own company. We license some trademarks from Disney and\r\noperate rides based on them, but we also aggressively license from\r\nother parties -- Warners, Universal, Nintendo. Even the French\r\ncomic-book publisher responsible for Asterix. That means that we get a\r\nlot of people coming in and out of the organization, contractors or\r\nconsultants working on designing a single ride or show.\r\n\r\n\"That creates a lot of opportunities for corporate espionage. Knowing\r\nwhat properties we're considering licensing gives the competition a\r\nchance to get there ahead of us, to land an exclusive deal that sets\r\nus back on square one. It's ugly stuff -- they call it 'competitive\r\nintelligence' but it's just spying, plain old spying.\r\n\r\n\"All of our employees have been contacted, one time or another, by\r\nsomeone with an offer -- get me a uniform, or a pic of the design\r\nroughs, or a recording of the soundtrack, or a copy of the contracts,\r\nand I'll make it worth your while. From street-sweepers to senior\r\nexecs, the money is just sitting there, waiting for us to pick it up.\"\r\n\r\nThe wench brought them their gigantic pewter plates of roast-beef,\r\nYorkshire pudding, parsnips, and a mountain of french fries,\r\npresumably to appease the middle-American appetites of the more\r\nunadventurous diners.\r\n\r\nFreddy sliced off a throat-plugging lump of beef and skewered it on\r\nhis fork.\r\n\r\n\"You're going to tell me that the temptation overwhelmed one of your\r\nemployees, yes?\" He shoved the entire lump into his mouth and began to\r\nmasticate it, cheeks pouched out, looking like a kid with a mouthful\r\nof bubble-gum.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. Our competitors don't want to compete with us on a level\r\nplaying field. They are, more than anything, imitators. They take the\r\nstuff that we carefully build, based on extensive research, design and\r\ntesting, and they clone it for parking-lot amusement rides. There's no\r\nattention to detail. There's no attention to safety! It's all cowboys\r\nand gypsies.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy kept chewing, but he dug in the pockets of his sports-coat and\r\ncame up with a small stubby notebook and a ball-point. He jotted some\r\nnotes, shielding the pad with his body.\r\n\r\n\"And these crass imitators enter into our story how?\" Freddy asked\r\naround his beef.\r\n\r\n\"You know about these New Work people -- they call themselves\r\n're-mixers' but that's just a smokescreen. They like to cloak\r\nthemselves in some post-modern, 'Creative Commons' legitimacy, but\r\nwhen it comes down to it, they made their fortune off the intellectual\r\nproperty of others, uncompensated use of designs and technologies that\r\nothers had invested in and created.\r\n\r\n\"So when they made a ride, it wasn't much of much. Like some kind of\r\ndusty Commie museum, old trophies from their last campaign. But\r\nsomewhere along the way, they hooked up with one of these brokers who\r\nspecializes in sneaking our secrets out of the park and into the hands\r\nof our competitors and quick as that, they were profitable --\r\nnationally franchised, even.\" He stopped to quaff his Bud Light and\r\nsurreptitiously checked out the journalist to see how much of this he\r\nwas buying. Impossible to say. He was still masticating a cheekful of\r\nrare roast, juice overflowing the corners of his mouth. But his hand\r\nmoved over his pad and he made an impatient go-on gesture with his\r\nhead, swallowing some of his payload.\r\n\r\n\"We fired some of the people responsible for the breaches, but there\r\nwill be more. With 50,000 castmembers --\" The writer snorted a laugh\r\nat the Disney-speak and choked a little, washing down the last of his\r\nmouthful with a chug of beer. \"-- 50,000 *employees* it's inevitable\r\nthat they'll find more. These ex-employees, meanwhile, have moved to\r\nthe last refuge of the scoundrel: Internet message boards, petulant\r\ntweets, and whiny blogs, where they're busily running us down. We\r\ncan't win, but at least we can stanch the bleeding. That's why we've\r\nbrought our lawsuits, and why we'll bring the next round.\"\r\n\r\nThe journalist's hand moved some more, then he turned a fresh page. \"I\r\nsee, I see. Yes, all fascinating, really. But what about these\r\ncountersuits?\"\r\n\r\n\"More posturing. Pirates love to put on aggrieved airs. These guys\r\nripped us off and got caught at it, and now they want to sue us for\r\ntheir trouble. You know how counter-suits work: they're just a bid to\r\nget a fast settlement: 'Well, I did something bad but so did you, why\r\ndon't we shake hands and call it a day?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh huh. So you're telling me that these intellectual property pirates\r\nmade a fortune knocking off your rides and that they're only\r\ncounter-suing you to get a settlement out of you, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it in a nutshell. I wanted to sit down with you, on\r\nbackground, and just give you our side of things, the story you won't\r\nget from the press-releases. I know you're the only one trying to\r\nreally get at the story behind the story with these people.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy had finished his entire roast and was working his way through\r\nthe fries and limp Yorkshire pudding. He waved vigorously at their\r\nserving wench and hollered, \"More here, love!\" and quaffed his beer.\r\n\r\nSammy dug into his cold dinner and speared up a forkful, waiting for\r\nFreddy to finish swallowing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's a very neat little story, Mr Disney Executive off the\r\nrecord on background.\" Sammy felt a vivid twinge of anxiety. Freddy's\r\neyes glittered in the torchlight. \"Very neat indeed.\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you one of my own. When I was a young man, before I took\r\nup the pen, I worked a series of completely rubbish jobs. I cleaned\r\ntoilets, I drove a taxi, I stocked grocery shelves. You may ask how\r\nthis qualified me to write about the technology industry. Lots of\r\npeople have, in fact, asked that.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you why it qualifies me. It qualifies me because unlike all\r\nthe ivory-tower bloggers, rich and comfortable geeks whose\r\nmasturbatory rants about Apple not honoring their warranties are what\r\npasses for corporate criticism online, I've been there. I'm not from a\r\nrich family, I didn't get to go to the best schools, no one put a PC\r\nin my bedroom when I was six. I worked for an honest living before I\r\ngave up honest work to write.\r\n\r\n\"As much as the Internet circle-jerk disgusts me, it's not a patch on\r\nthe businesses themselves. You Disney people with your minimum wage\r\nand all the sexual harassment you can eat labor policies in your nice\r\nright-to-work state, you get away with murder. Anyone who criticizes\r\nyou does so on your own terms: Is Disney exploiting its workers too\r\nmuch? Is it being too aggressive in policing its intellectual\r\nproperty? Should it be nicer about it?\r\n\r\n\"I'm the writer who doesn't watch your corporations on your own\r\nterms. I don't care if another business is unfairly competing with\r\nyour business. I care that your business is unfair to the world. That\r\nit aggressively exploits children to get their parents to spend money\r\nthey don't have on junk they don't need. I care that your workers\r\ncan't unionize, make shit wages, and get fired when they complain or\r\nwhen you need to flex your power a little.\r\n\r\n\"I grew up without any power at all. When I was working for a living,\r\nI had no say at all in my destiny. It didn't matter how much shit a\r\nboss wanted to shovel on me, all I could do was stand and take it. Now\r\nI've got some power, and I plan on using it to setting things to\r\nrights.\"\r\n\r\nSammy chewed his roast long past the point that it was ready to\r\nswallow. The fact that he'd made an error was readily apparent from\r\nthe start of Freddy's little speech, but with each passing minute, the\r\ndepth of his error grew. He'd really fucked up. He felt like throwing\r\nup. This guy was going to fuck him, he could tell.\r\n\r\nFreddy smiled and quaffed and wiped at his beard with the embroidered\r\nnapkin. \"Oh, look -- the jousting's about to start,\" he said. Knights\r\nin armor on horseback circled the arena, lances held high. The crowd\r\napplauded and an announcer came on the PA to tell them each knight's\r\nname, referring them to a program printed on their placemats. Sammy\r\npretended to be interested while Freddy cheered them on, that same\r\nlook of unholy glee plain on his face.\r\n\r\nThe knights formed up around the ring and their pimply squires came\r\nout of the gate and tended to them. There was a squire and knight\r\nright in front of them, and the squire tipped his hat to them. Freddy\r\nhanded the kid a ten-dollar bill. Sammy never tipped live performers;\r\nhe hated buskers and panhandlers. It all reminded him of stuffing a\r\nstripper's G-string. He liked his media a little more impersonal than\r\nthat. But Freddy was looking at him, so with a weak little smile, he\r\nhanded the squire the smallest thing in his wallet -- a twenty.\r\n\r\nThe jousting began. It was terrible. The \"knights\" couldn't ride worth\r\na damn, their \"lances\" missed one another by farcical margins, and\r\ntheir \"falls\" were so obviously staged that even the chubby ten year\r\nold beside him was clearly unimpressed.\r\n\r\n\"Got to go to the bathroom,\" he said into Freddy's ear. In leaning\r\nover, he contrived to get a look at the reporter's notebook. It was\r\ncovered in obscene doodles of Mickey Mouse with a huge erection,\r\nMinnie dangling from a noose. There wasn't a single word written on\r\nit. What little blood was left in Sammy's head drained into his feet,\r\nwhich were leaden and uncoordinated on the long trip to the filthy\r\ntoilets.\r\n\r\nHe splashed cold water on his face in the sink, and then headed back\r\ntoward his seat. He never made it. From the top of the stairs leading\r\ndown to ringside, he saw Freddy quaffing more ale and flirting with\r\nthe wench. The thunder of horse-hooves and the soundtrack of cinematic\r\nmusic drowned out all sounds, but nothing masked the stink of the\r\nmanure falling from the horses, half of which were panicking (the\r\nother half appeared to be drugged).\r\n\r\nThis was a mistake. He thought Freddy was a gossip reporter who liked\r\njuicy stories. Turned out he was also one of those tedious\r\nanti-corporate types who would happily hang Sammy out to dry. Time to\r\ncut his losses.\r\n\r\nHe turned on his heel and headed for the door. The doorman was having\r\na cigarette with a guy in a sports-coat who was wearing a manager\r\nbadge on his lapel.\r\n\r\n\"Leaving so soon? The show's only just getting started!\" The manager\r\nwas sweating under his sports-coat. He had a thin mustache and badly\r\ndied chestnut hair cut like a Lego character's.\r\n\r\n\"Not interested,\" Sammy said. \"All the off-theme stuff distracted\r\nme. Nose-rings. Blue hair. Cigarettes.\" The doorman guiltily flicked\r\nhis cigarette into the parking lot. Sammy felt a little better.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that, sir,\" the manager said. He was prematurely\r\ngrey under the dye-job, for he couldn't have been more than\r\nthirty-five. Thirty-five years old and working a dead-end job like\r\nthis -- Sammy was thirty-five. This is where he might end up if his\r\nscrew-ups came back to haunt him. \"Would you like a comment-card?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Sammy said. \"Any outfit that can't figure out clean toilets and\r\ndecent theming on its own can't benefit from my advice.\" The doorman\r\nflushed and looked away, but the manager's smile stayed fixed and\r\ncalm. Maybe he was drugged, like the horses. It bothered\r\nSammy. \"Christ, how long until this place gets turned into a\r\nroller-derby again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like a refund, sir?\" the manager asked. He looked out at\r\nthe parking lot. Sammy followed his gaze, looking above the cars, and\r\nrealized, suddenly, that he was standing in a cool tropical\r\nevening. The sky had gone the color of a ripe plum, with proud palms\r\nsilhouetted against it. The wind made them sway. A few clouds scudded\r\nacross the moon's luminous face, and the smell of citrus and the hum\r\nof insects and the calls of night birds were vivid on the evening air.\r\n\r\nHe'd been about to say something cutting to the manager, one last\r\nattempt to make the man miserable, but he couldn't be bothered. He had\r\na nice screened-in porch behind his house, with a hammock. He'd sat in\r\nit on nights like this, years ago. Now all he wanted to do was sit in\r\nit again.\r\n\r\n\"Good night,\" he said, and headed for his car.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nPerry's cast *stank*. It had started to go a little skunky on the\r\nsecond day, but after a week it was like he had a dead animal stuck to\r\nhis shoulder. A rotting dead animal. A rotting, itchy dead animal.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you're supposed to be doing this on your own,\" Hilda\r\nsaid, as he sawed awkwardly at it with the utility knife. It was made\r\nof something a lot tougher than the fiberglass one he'd had when he\r\nbroke his leg falling off the roof as a kid (he'd been up there\r\nscouting out glider possibilities).\r\n\r\n\"So you do it,\" he said, handing her the knife. He couldn't stand the\r\nsmell for one second longer.\r\n\r\n\"Uh-uh, not me, pal. No way that thing is supposed to come off anytime\r\nsoon. If you're going to cripple yourself, you're going to have to do\r\nit on your own.\"\r\n\r\nHe made a rude sound. \"Fuck hospitals, fuck doctors, and fuck this\r\nfucking cast. My arm barely hurts these days. We can splint it once I\r\nget this off, that'll immobilize it. They told me I'd need this for\r\n*six weeks*. I can't wear this for six weeks. I'll go nuts.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll go lame if you take it off. Your poor mother, you must have\r\ndriven her nuts.\"\r\n\r\nHe slipped and cut himself and winced, but tried not to let her know,\r\nbecause that's exactly what she'd predicted would happen. After a\r\ncouple days together, she'd become an expert at predicting exactly\r\nwhich of his escapades would end in disaster. It was a little spooky.\r\n\r\nBlood oozed out from under the cast and slicked his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Right, off to the hospital. I told you you'd get this thing wet if\r\nyou got in the shower. I told you that it would stink and rot and itch\r\nif you did. I told you to let me give you a sponge bath.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not insured.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll go to the free clinic.\"\r\n\r\nDefeated, he let her lead him to her car.\r\n\r\nShe helped him buckle in, wrinkling her nose. \"What's wrong, baby?\"\r\nshe said, looking at his face. \"What are you moping about?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just the cast,\" he said, looking away.\r\n\r\nShe grabbed him by the chin and turned him to face her. \"Look, don't\r\ndo that. Do *not* do that. If something's bothering you, we're going\r\nto talk about it. I didn't sign up to fall in love with the strong\r\nsilent type. You've been sulking all day, now what's it about?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled in spite of himself. \"All right, I give in. I miss\r\nhome. They're all in the middle of it, running the ride and stuff, and\r\nI'm here.\" He felt a moment's worry that she'd be offended. \"Not that\r\nI don't love being here with you, but I'm feeling guilty --\"\r\n\r\n\"OK, I get it. Of course you feel guilty. It's your project, it's in\r\ntrouble, and you're not taking care of it. Christ, Perry, is that all?\r\nI would have been disappointed if this wasn't worrying you. Let's go\r\nto Florida then.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed the tip of his nose. \"Take me to Florida, let's meet your\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\n\"But...\" Were they moving in together or something? He was totally\r\nsmitten with this girl, but that was *fast*. Even for Perry. \"Don't\r\nyou need to be here?\"\r\n\r\n\"They can live without me. It's not like I'm proposing to move in with\r\nyou. I'll come back here after a while. But I'm only doing two classes\r\nthis term and they're both offered by distance-ed. Let's just go.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"After the hospital. You need a new cast, stinkmeister. Roll down your\r\nwindow a little, OK? Whew!\"\r\n\r\nThe doctors warned him to let the new cast set overnight before\r\nsubjecting it to the rigors of a TSA examination, so they spent one\r\nmore night at Hilda's place. Perry spent it going over the mailing\r\nlist traffic and blog posts, confirming the plane tickets, ordering a\r\ncar to meet them at the Miami airport. He finally managed to collapse\r\ninto bed at 3AM, and Hilda grabbed him, dragged him to her, and\r\nspooned him tightly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, baby. Your friends and I will get along great.\"\r\n\r\nHe hadn't realized that he'd been worrying about this, but once she\r\npointed it out, it was obvious. \"You're not worried?\"\r\n\r\nShe ran her hands over his furry chest and tummy. \"No, of course\r\nnot. Your friends will love me or I'll have them killed. More to the\r\npoint, they'll love me because you love me and I love you and they\r\nlove you, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does Ernie think of me?\" he said, thinking of her brother for\r\nthe first time since they'd hooked up all those months ago.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hum,\" she said. He stiffened. \"No, it's OK,\" she said, rubbing\r\nhis tummy some more. It tickled. \"He's glad I'm with someone I care\r\nabout, and he loves the ride. He's just, you know. Protective of his\r\nbig sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's he worried about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what you'd expect. We live thousands of miles apart. You're ten\r\nyears older than me. You've been getting into the kind of trouble that\r\nattracts armed cops. Wouldn't you be protective if you were my bro?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was an only child, but sure, OK, I see that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing,\" she said. \"Really. Bring him a nice souvenir from\r\nFlorida when we come back to Madison, take him out for a couple beers\r\nand it'll all be great.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we're cool? All the families are in agreement? All the stars are\r\nin alignment? Everything is hunky and/or dory?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perry Gibbons, I love you dearly. You love me. We've got a cause to\r\nfight for, and it's a just one with many brave comrades fighting\r\nalongside of us. What could possibly go wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"What could possibly go wrong?\" Perry said. He drew in a breath to\r\nstart talking.\r\n\r\n\"It was rhetorical, goofball. It's also three in the morning. Sleep,\r\nfor tomorrow we fly.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nLester didn't want to open the ride, but someone had to. Someone had\r\nto, and it wasn't Perry, who was off with his midwestern honey. Lester\r\nwould have loved to sleep in and spend the day in his workshop\r\nrebuilding his 64-bit registers -- he'd had some good ideas for\r\nimproving on the initial design, and he still had the CAD files, which\r\nwere the hard part anyway.\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly across the parking lot, the sunrise in his eyes, a\r\ncup of coffee steaming in his hand. He'd almost gone to the fatkins\r\nbars the night before -- he'd almost gone ten, fifteen times, every\r\ntime he thought of Suzanne storming out of his lab, but he'd stayed\r\nhome with the TV and waited for her to turn up or call or post\r\nsomething to her blog or turn up on IM, and when none of those things\r\nhad happened by 4AM, he tumbled into bed and slept for three hours\r\nuntil his alarm went off again.\r\n\r\nBlearily, he sat himself down behind the counter, greeted some of the\r\nhawkers coming across the road, and readied his ticket-roll.\r\n\r\nThe first customers arrived just before nine -- an East Indian family\r\ndriving a car with Texas plates. Dad wore khaki board-shorts and a\r\ntank-top and leather sandals, Mom was in a beautiful silk sari, and\r\nthe kids looked like mall-bangbangers in designer versions of the\r\nstuff the wild kids in the shantytown went around in.\r\n\r\nThey came out of the ride ten minutes later and asked for their money\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing in there,\" the dad said, almost apologetically. \"It's\r\nempty. I don't think it's supposed to be empty, is it?\"\r\n\r\nLester put the roll of tickets into his pocket and stepped into the\r\nWal-Mart. His eyes took a second to adjust to the dark after the\r\nbrightness of the rising Florida sun. When they were fully adjusted,\r\nthough, he could see that the tourist was right. Busy robots had torn\r\ndown all the exhibits and scenes, leaving nothing behind but swarming\r\ncrowds of bots on the floor, dragging things offstage. The smell of\r\nthe printers was hot and thick.\r\n\r\nLester gave the man his money back.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, man, I don't know what's going on. This kind of thing should\r\nbe impossible. It was all there last night.\"\r\n\r\nThe man patted him on the shoulder. \"It's all right. I'm an engineer\r\n-- I know all about crashes. It just needs some debugging, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\nLester got out a computer and started picking through the logs. This\r\nkind of failure really should be impossible. Without manual oversight,\r\nthe bots weren't supposed to change more than five percent of the ride\r\nin response to another ride's changes. If all the other rides had torn\r\nthemselves down, it might have happened, but they hadn't, had they?\r\n\r\nNo, they hadn't. A quick check of the logs showed that none of the\r\nchanges had come from Madison, or San Francisco, or Boston, or\r\nWestchester, or any of the other ride-sites.\r\n\r\nEither his robots had crashed or someone had hacked the system. He\r\nrebooted the system and rolled it back to the state from the night\r\nbefore and watched the robots begin to bring the props back from\r\noffstage.\r\n\r\nHow the hell could it have happened? He dumped the logs and began to\r\nsift through them. He kept getting interrupted by riders who wanted to\r\nknow when the ride would come back up, but he didn't know, the robots'\r\nestimates were oscillating wildly between ten minutes and ten\r\nhours. He finally broke off to write up a little quarter-page flier\r\nabout it and printed out a couple hundred of them on some neon yellow\r\npaper stock he had lying around, along with a jumbo version that he\r\ntaped over the price-list.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't enough. Belligerent riders who'd traveled for hours to see\r\nthe ride wanted a human explanation, and they pestered him\r\nceaselessly. All the hawkers felt like they deserved more information\r\nthan the rubes, and they pestered him even more. All he wanted to do\r\nwas write some regexps that would help him figure out what was wrong\r\nso he could fix it.\r\n\r\nHe wished that Death kid would show up already. He was supposed to be\r\nhelping out from now on and he seemed like the kind of person who\r\nwould happily jaw with the marks until the end of time.\r\n\r\nEventually he gave up. He set the sign explaining what had happened\r\n(or rather, not explaining, since he didn't fucking know yet) down in\r\nthe middle of the counter, bolted it down with a couple of lock-bolts,\r\nand retreated to the ride's interior and locked the smoked-glass doors\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nOnce he had some peace and quiet, it took only him a few minutes to\r\nsee where the changes had originated. He verified the info three\r\ntimes, not because he wasn't sure, but because he couldn't tell if\r\nthis was good news or bad news. He read some blogs and discovered lots\r\nof other ride-operators were chasing this down but none of them had\r\nfigured it out yet.\r\n\r\nGrinning hugely, he composed a hasty post and CCed it to a bunch of\r\nmailing lists, then went out to find Kettlebelly and Tjan.\r\n\r\nHe found them in the guesthouse, sitting down to a working breakfast,\r\nwith Eva and the kids at the end of the table. Tjan's little girl was\r\ntrying to feed Pascal, but not doing a great job of it; Tjan's son sat\r\non his lap, picking at his clown-face pancakes.\r\n\r\n\"Morning guys!\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne narrowed her eyes and looked away. The table fell quiet --\r\neven the kids sensed that something was up. \"Who's watching the ride,\r\nLester?\" Tjan asked, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"It's shut,\" he said cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"*Shut*?\" Tjan spoke loudly enough that everyone jumped a\r\nlittle. Lyenitchka accidentally stabbed Pascal with the spoon and he\r\nstarted to wail. Suzanne stood up from the table and walked quickly\r\nout of the guesthouse, holding on to her phone as a kind of thin\r\npretense of having to take a call. Lester chose to ignore her.\r\n\r\nLester held his hands out placatingly. \"It's OK -- it's just down for\r\na couple hours. I had to reset it after what happened last night.\"\r\n\r\nLester waited.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Eva said, \"I'll bite. What happened last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brazil came online!\" Lester said. \"Like twenty rides opened\r\nthere. But they got their protocol implementation a little wrong so\r\nwhen I showed up, the whole ride had been zeroed out. I'm sure I can\r\nhelp them get it right; in the meantime I've got the ride resetting\r\nitself and I've blackholed their changes temporarily.\" He grinned\r\nsunnily. \"How fucking cool is that? Brazil!\"\r\n\r\nThey smiled weakly back. \"I don't think I understand, Lester,\"\r\nKettlewell said. \"Brazil? We don't have any agreements with anyone in\r\nBrazil.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have agreements with everyone in Brazil!\" Lester said. \"We've got\r\nan open protocol and a server that anyone can connect to. That's an\r\nagreement, that's all a protocol is.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell shook his head. \"You're saying that all anyone needed to do\r\nto reprogram our ride --\"\r\n\r\n\"-- was to connect to it and send some changes. Trust is assumed in\r\nthe system.\"\r\n\r\n\"Trust is *assumed*? You haven't changed this?\"\r\n\r\nLester took a step back. \"No, I haven't changed it. The whole system\r\nis open -- that's the point. We can't just start requiring logins to\r\nget on the network. The whole thing would collapse -- it'd be like\r\nputting locks on the bathroom and then taking the only key for\r\nyourself. We just can't do it.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell looked like he was going to explode. Tjan put a hand on his\r\narm. Slowly, Kettlewell sat back down. Tjan took a sip of his coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Lester, can you walk me through this one more time?\"\r\n\r\nLester rocked back and forth a little. They were all watching him now,\r\nexcept for Suzanne, who was fuming somewhere or getting ready to go\r\nhome to Russia, or something.\r\n\r\n\"We have a published protocol for describing changes to the ride --\r\nit's built on Git3D's system for marking up and syncing three-d models\r\nof objects; it's what we used all through the Kodacell days for\r\ncollaboration. The way you get a ride online is to sync up with our\r\nversion-server and then instantiate a copy. Then any changes you make\r\nget synced back and we instantiate them. Everyone stays in sync, give\r\nor take a couple hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you had passwords on the Subversion server for objects, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, but we didn't design this one to take passwords. It's a lot\r\nmore ad-hoc -- we wanted to be sure that people we didn't know could\r\nget in and play.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell put his face in his hands and groaned.\r\n\r\nTjan rolled his eyes. \"I think what Kettlewell's trying to say is that\r\nthings have changed since those carefree days -- we're in a spot now\r\nwhere if Disney or someone else who hated us wanted to attack us, this\r\nwould be a prime way of doing it.\"\r\n\r\nLester nodded. \"Yeah, I figured that. Openness always costs\r\nsomething. But we get a lot of benefits out of openness too. The way\r\nit works now is that no one ride can change more than five percent of\r\nthe status quo within 24 hours without a manual approval. The problem\r\nwas that the Brazilians opened, like, *fifty* rides at the same time,\r\nand each of them zeroed out and tried to sync that and between them\r\nthey did way more than 100 percent. It'd be pretty easy to set things\r\nup so that no more than five percent can be changed, period, within a\r\n24-hour period, without manual approval.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you can do that, why not set every change to require approval?\"\r\nKettlewell said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, for starters because we'd end up spending all our time clicking\r\nOK for five-centimeter adjustments to prop-positioning. But more\r\nimportantly, it's because the system is all about community -- we're\r\nnot in charge, we're just part of the network.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell made a sour face and muttered something. Tjan patted his\r\narm again. \"You guys *are* in charge, as much as you'd like not to\r\nbe. You're the ones facing the legal hassles, you're the ones who\r\ninvented it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We didn't, really,\" Lester said. \"This was a real standing on the\r\nshoulders of giants project. We made use of a bunch of stuff that was\r\non the shelf already, put it together, and then other people helped us\r\nrefine it and get it working well. We're just part of the group, like\r\nI keep saying.\" He had a thought. \"Besides, if we were in charge,\r\nBrazil wouldn't have been able to zero us out.\r\n\r\n\"You guys are being really weird and suit-y about this, you know? I've\r\nfixed the problem: no one can take us down like this again. It just\r\nwon't happen. I've put the fix on the version-server for the codebase,\r\nso everyone else can deploy it if they want to. The problem's\r\nsolved. We'll be shut for an hour or two, but who cares? You're\r\nmissing the big picture: Brazil opened fifty rides *yesterday*! I\r\nmean, it sucks that we didn't notice until it screwed us up, but\r\nBrazil's got it all online. Who's next? China? India?\"\r\n\r\n\"Russia?\" Kettlewell said, looking at the door that Suzanne had left\r\nby. He was clearly trying to needle Lester.\r\n\r\nLester ignored him. \"I'd love to go to Brazil and check out how\r\nthey've done it. I speak a little Portuguese even -- enough to say,\r\n'Are you 18 yet?' anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're *weird*,\" Lyenitchka said. Ada giggled and said, \"Weird!\"\r\n\r\nEva shook her head. \"The kids have got a point,\" she said. \"You people\r\nare all a little weird. Why are you fighting? Tjan, Landon, you came\r\nhere to manage the business side of things, and that's what you're\r\ndoing. Lester, you're in charge of the creative and technical stuff\r\nand that's what you're doing. Without Lester, you two wouldn't have\r\nany business to run. Without these guys, you'd be in jail or something\r\nby now. Make peace, because you're on the same side. I've got enough\r\nchildren to look after here.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell snapped a nod at her. \"Right as ever, darling. OK, I\r\napologize, all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me too,\" Lester said. \"I was kidding about going to Brazil -- at\r\nleast while Perry's still away.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's coming home,\" Tjan said. \"He called me this morning. He's\r\nbringing the girl, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yoko!\" Lester said, and grinned. \"OK, someone should get online and\r\nfind out how all the other rides are coping with this. I'm sure\r\nthey're going nutso out there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do that,\" Kettlewell said. \"We've got another call with the\r\nlawyers in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's all that going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me put it this way,\" Kettlewell said, and for a second he was\r\nback in his glory days, slick and formidable, a shark. \"I liquidated\r\nmy shares in Disney this morning. They're down fifty points since the\r\nNYSE opened. You wait until Tokyo wakes up, they're going to bail and\r\nbail and bail.\"\r\n\r\nLester smiled back. \"OK, well that's good, then.\"\r\n\r\nHe hunkered down with a laptop and got his homebrew wireless rig up\r\nand running -- a card would have been cheaper, but his rig gave him\r\nlots of robustness against malicious interference, multi-path and\r\nplain old attenuation -- and got his headline reader running.\r\n\r\nHe set to reading the posts and dispelling the popups that tried to\r\ncall his attention to this or that. His filters had lots to tell him\r\nabout, and the areas of his screen designated for different interests\r\nwere starting to pinken as they accumulated greater urgency.\r\n\r\nHe waved them away and concentrated on getting through to all the\r\nride-maintainers who had questions about his patches. But there was\r\none pink area that wouldn't go. It was his serendipity zone, where\r\nthings that didn't match his filters but had lots of interestingness\r\n-- comments and reposts from people he paid attention to -- and some\r\nconfluence with his keywords turned up.\r\n\r\nImpatiently, he waved it up, and a page made of bits of LiveJournals\r\nand news reports and photo-streams assembled itself.\r\n\r\nHis eye fell first on the photos. But for the shock of black and neon\r\ngreen hair, he wouldn't have recognized the kid in the pictures as\r\nDeath Waits. His face was a ruin. His nose was a bloody rose, his eyes\r\nwere both swollen shut. One ear was ruined -- apparently he'd been\r\ndragged some distance with that side of his head on the ground. His\r\ncheeks were pulpy and bruised. Then he clicked through to the photos\r\nfrom where they'd found Death, before they'd cleaned him up in the\r\nambulance, and he had to turn his head away and breathe deeply. Both\r\nlegs and both arms were clearly broken, with at least one compound\r\nfracture. His crotch -- Jesus. Lester looked away again, then quickly\r\nclosed the window.\r\n\r\nHe switched to text accounts from Death's friends who'd been to see\r\nhim in the hospital. He would live, but he might not walk again. He\r\nwas lucid, and he was telling stories about the man who'd beaten him\r\n--\r\n\r\n*You should just shut the fuck up about Disney on the fucking\r\n Internet, you know that, kid?*\r\n\r\nLester got up and went to find Kettlewell and Tjan and Suzanne -- oh,\r\nespecially Suzanne -- again. He didn't think for one second that Death\r\nwould have invented that. In fact, it was just the sort of brave thing\r\nthat the gutsy little kid might have had the balls to report on.\r\n\r\nEvery step he took, he saw that ruin of a face, the compound fracture,\r\nthe luminous blood around his groin. He made it halfway to the\r\nguesthouse before he found himself leaning against a shanty, throwing\r\nup. Tears and bile streaming down his face, chest heaving, Lester\r\ndecided that this wasn't about fun anymore. Lester came to understand\r\nwhat it meant to be responsible for people's lives. When he stood up\r\nand wiped his face on the tail of his tight, glittering shirt, he was\r\na different person.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSweating in the suffocating afternoon heat, his re-casted arm on fire,\r\nHilda had shown him the article about Death Waits while they were\r\nbeing screened for their connection at O'Hare. The TSA guy was\r\nswabbing his cast with a black-powder residue detector, and as Perry\r\nread it, he let out an involuntary yelp and a jump that sent him back\r\nfor a full round of tertiary screening. No date with Dr. Jellyfinger,\r\nthough it was a close thing.\r\n\r\nHilda was deep in her own phone, probing ferociously at it,\r\noccasionally picking it up and talking into it, then poking at it some\r\nmore. Neither of them looked out the windows much, though in his mind,\r\nPerry had rehearsed this homecoming as a kind of tour of his\r\nterritory, picking out which absurd landmarks he'd point out, which\r\nfunny stories he'd tell, pausing to nuzzle Hilda's throat.\r\n\r\nBut by the time he'd absorbed the mailing-list traffic and done a\r\ncouple phoners with the people back in Madison -- particularly Ernie,\r\nwho was freaking about Death Waits and calling for tight physical\r\nsecurity for all their people -- they were pulling in at the ride. The\r\ncabbie, a Turk, wasn't very cool about the neighborhood, and he kept\r\nslowing down on the side of the road and offering to let them out\r\nthere, and Perry kept insisting that he take them all the way.\r\n\r\n\"No, you can't just drop me here, man. For the tenth time, I've got a\r\nfucking *cast* on my *broken arm*. I'm not carrying my suitcase a mile\r\nfrom here. I live there. It's safe. God, it's not like I'm asking you\r\nto take me to a war-zone.\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't want to tip the guy, but he did. The cabbie was just trying\r\nto play it safe. Lots of people tried to play it safe. It didn't make\r\nthem assholes, even if it did make them ineffectual and useless.\r\n\r\nWhile Perry tipped him, Hilda pulled the suitcase out of the cab's\r\ntrunk and she'd barely had time to shut the lid when the driver roared\r\noff like he was trying to outrun a sniper.\r\n\r\nPerry grimaced. This was supposed to be a triumphant homecoming. He\r\nwas supposed to be showing off his toys, all he'd wrought, to this\r\ngirl. The town was all around them and they were about to charge in\r\nwithout even pausing to consider its Dr Seuss wonderment.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a sec,\" Perry said. He took her hand. \"See that? That was the\r\nfirst shanty they built. Five stories now.\" The building was made of\r\nprefab concrete for the first couple stories, then successively\r\nlighter materials, with the roof-shack made of bamboo. \"The designs\r\nare experimental, from the Army Corps of Engineers mostly, but they\r\nsay they'll stand a force-five hurricane.\" He grimaced\r\nagain. \"Probably not the bamboo one, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" Hilda said. \"What's that one?\" She'd picked up on his\r\nmood, she knew he wanted to show her around before they ended up\r\nembroiled in ride-politics and work again.\r\n\r\n\"You've got a good eye, my dear. That's the finest BBQ on the\r\ncontinent. See how the walls are a little sooty looking? That's\r\ncarbonized ambrosia, a mix of fat and spice and hickory that you could\r\nscrape off and bottle as perfume.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eww.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't tried Lemarr's ribs yet,\" he said, and goosed her. She\r\nsqueaked and punched him in the shoulder. He showed her the\r\ntuck-shops, the kids playing, the tutor's place, the day-care center,\r\nthe workshops, taking her on a grand-circle tour of this place he'd\r\nhelp conjure into existence.\r\n\r\n\"Now there's someone I haven't seen in far too long,\" Francis\r\nsaid. He'd aged something fierce in the last year, booze making his\r\nface subside into a mess of wrinkles and pouches and broken\r\nblood-vessels. He gave Perry a hard hug that smelled of booze, and it\r\nwasn't even lunchtime.\r\n\r\n\"Francis, meet Hilda Hammersen; Hilda, meet Francis Clammer: aerospace\r\nengineer and gentleman of leisure.\"\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and feinted a kiss at it, and Hilda good-naturedly\r\nrolled her eyes at this.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of our lovely little settlement, then, Ms\r\nHammersen?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's like something out of a fairy-tale,\" she said. \"You hear stories\r\nabout Christiania and how good and peaceful it all was, but whenever\r\nyou see squatters on TV, it's always crack houses and\r\ndrive-bys. You've really got something here.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis nodded. \"We get a bad rap, but we're no different really from\r\nany other place where people take pride in what they own. I built my\r\nplace, with my two hands. If Jimmy Carter had been there with Habitat\r\nfor Humanity, we would have gotten no end of good press. Because we\r\ndid it without a dead ex-president on the scene, we're crooks. Perry\r\ntell you about what the law does around here?'\r\n\r\nPerry nodded. \"Yeah. She knows.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis patted his cast. \"Nice hardware, buddy. So when some\r\nBible-thumping do-gooder gives you a leg up, you're a folk-hero. Help\r\nyourself, you're a CHUD. It's the same with you people and your\r\nride. If you had the backing of a giant corporation with claws sunk\r\ndeep into kids' brains, you'd be every package-tour operator's wet\r\ndream. Build it yourself in the guts of a dead shopping center, and\r\nyou're some kind of slimy underclass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe that's true,\" said Hilda. \"But it's not necessarily true. Back\r\nin Madison, the locals love us, they think we do great stuff. After\r\nthe law came after us, they came by with food and money and helped us\r\nrebuild. Scrappy activists get a lot of love in this country, too. Not\r\neveryone wants a big corporation to spoon-feed them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Off in hippie college-towns you'll always find people with enough\r\nbrains to realize that their neighbors aren't the boogieman. But there\r\nain't so many hippie college towns these days. I wish you two luck,\r\nbut I think you'd be nuts to walk out the door in the morning\r\nexpecting anything better than a kick in the teeth.\"\r\n\r\nThat made Perry think of Death Waits, and the sense of urgency came\r\nback to him. \"OK, we have to go now,\" he said. \"Thanks, Francis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nice to meet you, young woman,\" he said, and when he smiled, it was a\r\npainful thing, all pouches and wrinkles and sags, and he gimped away\r\nwith his limp more pronounced than ever.\r\n\r\nThey tracked down the crew at the tea-house's big table. Everyone\r\nroared greetings at them when they came through the door, a proper\r\nhomecoming, but when Perry counted heads, he realized that there was\r\nno one watching the ride.\r\n\r\n\"Guys, who's running the ride?\"\r\n\r\nThey told him about Brazil then, and Hilda listened with her head\r\ncocked, her face animated with surprise, dismay, then delight. \"You\r\nsay there are *fifty* rides open?\"\r\n\r\n\"All at once,\" Lester said. \"All in one go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy mother of poo,\" Hilda breathed. Perry couldn't even bring\r\nhimself to say *anything*. He couldn't even imagine Brazil in his head\r\n-- jungles? beaches? He knew nothing about the country. They'd built\r\n*fifty* rides, without even making contact with him. He and Lester had\r\ndesigned the protocol to be open because they thought it would make it\r\neasier for others to copy what they'd done, but he'd never thought --\r\n\r\nIt was like vertigo, that feeling.\r\n\r\n\"So you're Yoko, huh?\" Lester said finally. It made everyone smile,\r\nbut the tension was still there. Something big had just happened,\r\nbigger than any of them, bigger than the beating that had been laid on\r\nDeath Waits, bigger than anything Perry had ever done. From his mind\r\nto a nation on another continent --\r\n\r\n\"You're the sidekick, huh?\" Hilda said.\r\n\r\nLester laughed. \"Touche. It's very nice to meet you and thank you for\r\nbringing him back home. We were starting to miss him, though God alone\r\nknows why.\"\r\n\r\n\"I plan on keeping him,\" she said, giving his bicep a squeeze. It\r\nbrought Perry back to them. The little girls were staring at Hilda\r\nwith saucer eyes. It made him realize that except for Suzanne and Eva,\r\ntheir whole little band was boys, all boys.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm home now,\" he said. He knelt down and showed the girls his\r\ncast. \"I got a new one,\" he said. \"They had to throw the old one\r\nout. So I need your help decorating this. Do you think you could do\r\nthe job?\"\r\n\r\nLyenitchka looked critically at the surface. \"I think we could do the\r\ngig,\" she said. \"What do you think, partner?\"\r\n\r\nTjan snorted out his nose, but she was so solemn that the rest kept\r\nquiet. Ada matched Lyenitchka's critical posture and then nodded\r\nauthoritatively. \"Sure thing, partner.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a date,\" Perry said. \"We're gonna head home and put down our\r\nsuitcases and come back and open the ride if it's ready. It's time\r\nLester got some time off. I'm sure Suzanne will appreciate having him\r\nback again.\"\r\n\r\nAnother silence fell over the group, tense as a piano wire. Perry\r\nlooked from Lester to Suzanne and saw in a second what was up. He had\r\ntime to notice that his first emotional response was to be intrigued,\r\nnot sorry or scared. Only after a moment did he have the reaction he\r\nthought he should have -- a mixture of sadness for his friend and\r\nirritation that they had yet another thing to deal with in the middle\r\nof a hundred other crises.\r\n\r\nHilda broke the tension -- \"It was great to meet you all. Dinner\r\ntonight, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely,\" Kettlewell said, seizing on this. \"Leave it to us --\r\nwe'll book someplace just great and have a great dinner to welcome you\r\nguys back.\"\r\n\r\nEva took his arm. \"That's right,\" she said. \"I'll get the girls to\r\npick it out.\" The little girls jumped up and down with excitement at\r\nthis, and the baby brothers caught their excitement and made happy\r\nkid-screeches that got everyone smiling again.\r\n\r\nPerry gave Lester a solemn, supportive hug, kissed Suzanne and Eva on\r\nthe cheeks (Suzanne smelled good, something like sandalwood), shook\r\nhands with Tjan and Kettlewell and tousled all four kids before\r\nlighting out for the ride, gasping out a breath as they stepped into\r\nthe open air.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDeath Waits regained consciousness several times over the next week,\r\naware each time that he was waking up in a hospital bed on a crowded\r\nward, that he'd woken here before, and that he hurt and couldn't\r\nremember much after the beating had started.\r\n\r\nBut after a week or so, he found himself awake and aware -- he still\r\nhurt all over, a dull and distant stoned ache that he could tell was\r\nbeing kept at bay by powerful painkillers. There was someone waiting\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Darren,\" the man said. \"I'm an attorney working for your\r\nfriends at the ride. My name is Tom Levine. We're suing Disney and we\r\nwanted to gather some evidence from you.\"\r\n\r\nDeath didn't like being called Darren, and he didn't want to talk to\r\nthis dork. He'd woken up with a profound sense of anger, remembering\r\nthe dead-eyed guy shouting about Disney while bouncing his head off\r\nthe ground, knowing that Sammy had done this, wanting nothing more\r\nthan to get ahold of Sammy and, and... That's where he ran out of\r\nimagination. He was perfectly happy drawing medieval-style torture\r\nchambers and vampires in his sketch book, but he didn't actually have\r\nmuch stomach for, you know, *violence*.\r\n\r\nPer se.\r\n\r\n\"Can we do this some other time?\" His mouth hurt. He'd lost four teeth\r\nand had bitten his tongue hard enough to need stitches. He could\r\nbarely understand his own words.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could, but time is of the essence here. You've heard that\r\nwe're bringing a suit against Disney, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Death said.\r\n\r\n\"Must have come up while you were out. Anyway, we are, for unfair\r\ncompetition. We've got a shot at cleaning them out, taking them for\r\nevery cent. We're going through the pre-trial motions now and there's\r\nbeen a motion to summarily exclude any evidence related to your\r\nbeating from the proceedings. We think that's BS. It's clear from what\r\nyou've told your friends that they wanted to shut you up because you\r\nwere making them look bad. So what we need is more information from\r\nyou about what this guy said to you, and what you'd posted before, and\r\nanything anyone at Disney said to you while you were working there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that that guy said he was beating me up because I talked\r\nabout this stuff in the first place?\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer waved a hand. \"There's no way they'll come after you\r\nnow. They look like total assholes for doing this. They're scared\r\nstupid. Now, I'm going to want to formally depose you later, but this\r\nis a pre-deposition interview just to get clear on everything.\"\r\n\r\nThe guy leaned forward and suddenly Death Waits had a bone-deep\r\nconviction that the guy was about to punch him. He gave a little\r\nsqueak and shrank away, then cried out again as every inch of his body\r\nawoke in hot agony, a feeling like grating bones beneath his skin.\r\n\r\n\"Woah, take it easy there, champ,\" the lawyer said.\r\n\r\nDeath Waits held back tears. The guy wasn't going to hit him, but just\r\nthe movement in his direction had scared him like he'd leapt out\r\nholding an axe. The magnitude of his own brokenness began to sink in\r\nand now he could barely hold back the tears.\r\n\r\n\"Look, the guys who run the ride have told me that I have to get this\r\nfrom you as soon as I can. If we're going to keep the ride safe and\r\nnail the bastards who did this to you, I need to do this. If I had my\r\nway, I wouldn't bug you, but I've got my orders, OK?\"\r\n\r\nDeath snuffled back the tears. The back of his throat felt like it had\r\nbeen sanded with a rusty file. \"Water,\" he croaked.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer shook his head. \"Sorry buddy, just the IV, I'm afraid. The\r\nnurses were very specific. Let's start, OK, and then we'll be done\r\nbefore you know it.\"\r\n\r\nDefeated, Death closed his eyes. \"Start,\" he said, his voice like\r\nsomething made from soft tar left too long in the sun.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSammy knew he was a dead man. The only thing keeping him alive was\r\nlegal's reluctance to read the net. Hackelberg had a couple of juniors\r\nwho kept watch-lists running on hot subjects, but they liked to print\r\nthem out and mark them up, and that meant that they lagged a day or\r\ntwo behind the blogosphere.\r\n\r\nThe Death Waits thing was a freaking disaster. The guy was just\r\nsupposed to put a scare into him, not cripple him for life. Every time\r\nSammy thought about what would happen when the Death Waits thing\r\npercolated up to him, he got gooseflesh.\r\n\r\nDamn that idiot thug anyway. Sammy had been very clear. The guy who\r\nknew the guy who knew the guy had been reassuring on the phone when\r\nSammy put in the order -- sure, sure, nothing too rough, just a little\r\nshoving around.\r\n\r\nAnd what's worse is the idiot kid hadn't gotten the hint. Sammy didn't\r\nget it. If a stranger beat him half to death and told him to stop\r\nhanging out in message-boards, well, the message-boards would\r\ngo. Damned right they would.\r\n\r\nAnd with Freddy, there was a shoe waiting to drop. Freddy wouldn't\r\nreport on their interview, he was pretty sure of that. \"Off the\r\nrecord\" means something, even to \"journalists\" like Honest Freddy. But\r\nFreddy wasn't going to be nice to him in follow-ups, that much was\r\nsure. And if -- when! -- Freddy got wind of the Death Waits\r\nsituation...\r\n\r\nHe began to hyperventilate.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to go check on the construction,\" he said to his personal\r\nassistant, a new girl they'd sent up when his last one had defected to\r\nwork for Wiener (Wiener!) after Sammy'd shouted at her for putting\r\nthrough a press-call from some blogger who wanted to know when\r\nFantasyland would be re-opening.\r\n\r\nIt had been a mistake to shut down Fantasyland just to get the other\r\nmanagers off his back. Sure the rides were sick dogs, but there had\r\nbeen life in them still. Construction sites don't bring in visitors,\r\nand the numbers for the park were down and everyone was looking at\r\nhim. Never mind that the only reason the numbers had been as high as\r\nthey were was that Sammy had saved everyone's ass when he'd done the\r\ngoth rehab. Never mind that the real reason that numbers were down was\r\nthat no one else in management had the guts to keep the park moving\r\nand improving.\r\n\r\nHe slowed his step on Main Street, USA, and forced himself to pay\r\nattention to his surroundings. The stores on Main Street had been\r\nco-opted into helping him dump all the superfluous goth merchandise,\r\nand it was in their windows and visible through their doors. The\r\nfatkins pizza-stands and ice-cream wagons were doing a brisk trade\r\naround the castle roundabout. The crowd was predominantly veering to\r\nthe left, toward Adventureland and Frontierland and Liberty Square,\r\nwhile the right side of the plaza, which held the gateways to\r\nFantasyland and Tomorrowland, was conspicuously sparse. He'd known\r\nthat his numbers were down, but standing in the crowd's flow, he could\r\nfeel it.\r\n\r\nHe cleared the castle and stood for a moment at the brink of\r\nFantasyland. It should be impossible to stand here at one in the\r\nafternoon -- there should be busy rushes of people pushing past to get\r\non the rides and to eat and to buy stuff, but now there were just a\r\nfew kids in eyeliner puffing cloves in smokeless hookahs and a\r\nwasteland of hoardings painted a shade Imagineering called \"go-away\r\ngreen\" for its ability to make the eye slide right past it.\r\n\r\nHe'd left the two big coasters open, and they had decent queues, but\r\nthat was it. No one was in the stores, and no one was bothering with\r\nthe zombie maze. Clouds of dust and loud destruction noises rose over\r\nthe hoardings, and he slipped into a staff door and threaded his way\r\nonto one of the sites, pausing to pick up a safety helmet with\r\nmouse-ears.\r\n\r\nAt least these crews were efficient. He'd long ago impressed on the\r\ndepartment that hired construction contractors the necessity of\r\ndecommissioning old rides with extreme care so as to preserve as much\r\nof the collectible value of the finishings and trim as possible. It\r\nwas a little weird -- Disney customers howled like stuck pigs when you\r\nshut down their rides, then fought for the chance to spend fortunes\r\nbuying up the dismembered corpses of their favored amusements.\r\n\r\nHe watched some Cuban kids carefully melting the hot glue that had\r\nheld the skull trim-elements to the pillar of the Dia de los Muertos\r\nfacade, setting them atop a large pile of other trim -- scythes,\r\nhooded figures, tombstones -- with a layer of aerogel beneath to keep\r\nthe garriture from scratching. The whole area behind the hoardings was\r\nlike this -- rides in pieces, towers of fiberglass detritus sandwiched\r\nbetween layers of aerogel.\r\n\r\nThey'd done this before, when he'd taken Fantasyland down, and he'd\r\nfretted every moment about how long the tear-down was taking. There\r\nwere exciting new plans lurking in the wings then, waiting to leap\r\nonstage and take shape. He'd had some of the ride components\r\nfabricated by a contractor in Kissimmee, but large chunks of the\r\nconstruction had to take place onsite. The advantage had been his:\r\ncheap fabricators, new materials, easy collaboration between remote\r\ncontractors and his people on-site. No one had ever executed new rides\r\nas fast and as well as he had. The things had basically built\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nNow the competition was using the same tech and it was a fucking\r\ndisaster for him. Worse and worse: he had no plans for what was to\r\ncome afterward. He'd thought that he'd just grab some of the audience\r\nresearch people, throw together a fatkins focus group or two, and give\r\nImagineering two weeks to come up with some designs they could put up\r\nfast. He knew from past experience that design expanded to fill the\r\ntime available to it, and that the best stuff usually emerged in the\r\nfirst ten days anyway, and after that it was all committee\r\ngroup-think.\r\n\r\nBut no one from audience research wanted to return his calls, no one\r\nfrom Imagineering was willing to work for him, and no one wanted to\r\nvisit a section of the park that was dominated by construction\r\nhoardings and demolition dust.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell was happening at the Miami ride, anyway? He could follow\r\nit online, run the three-d flythroughs of the ride as it stood, even\r\ndownload and print his own versions of the ride objects, but none of\r\nthat told him what it *felt like* to get on the ride, to be in its\r\nclanking bowels, surrounded by other riders, pointing and marveling\r\nand laughing at the scenes and motion.\r\n\r\nRides were things that you had to ride to understand. Describing a\r\nride was like talking about a movie -- so abstract and remote. Like\r\ntalking about sex versus having sex.\r\n\r\nSammy loved rides. Or he used to, anyway. So much more than films, so\r\nmuch more than books -- so immersive and human, and the whole crowd\r\nthing, all the other people waiting to ride it or just getting off\r\nit. It had started with coasters -- doesn't every kid love coasters?\r\n-- but he'd ended up a connoisseur, a gourmand who loved every species\r\nof ride, from thrill-rides to monorails, carousels to dark-rides.\r\n\r\nThere'd been a time when he'd ridden every ride in the park once a\r\nweek, and every ride in every nearby park once a month. That had been\r\nyears before. Now he sat in an office and made important decisions and\r\nhe was lucky if he made it onto a ride once a week.\r\n\r\nNot that it mattered anymore. He'd screwed up so bad that it was only\r\na matter of time until he ended up on the bread-line. Or in jail.\r\n\r\nHe realized he was staring glumly at the demolition, and pulled\r\nhimself upright, sucked in a few breaths, mentally kicked himself in\r\nthe ass and told himself to stop feeling sorry for himself.\r\n\r\nA young woman pried loose another resin skull finial and added it to\r\nthe pile, placed another sheet of aerogel on top of it.\r\n\r\nPeople loved these little tchotchkes. They had a relationship with\r\nDisney Parks that made them want to come again and again, to own a\r\npiece of the place. They came for visits and then they visited in\r\ntheir hearts and they came back to bring their hearts home. It was an\r\nextremely profitable dynamic.\r\n\r\nThat's what those ride people up in the Wal-Mart were making their hay\r\non -- anyone could replicate the ride in their back-yard. You didn't\r\nhave to fly from Madison to Orlando to have a little refresher\r\nexperience. It was right there, at the end of the road.\r\n\r\nIf only there was some way to put his rides, his park, right there in\r\nthe riders' homes, in their literal back-yards. Being able to look at\r\nthe webcams and take a three-d fly-through was one thing, but it\r\nwasn't the physical, visceral experience of being there.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance crew had finished all the trim and now they were going\r\nafter the props and animatronics. They never used to sell these off,\r\nbecause manufacturing the guts of a robot was too finicky to do any\r\nmore than you had to -- it was far better to repurpose them, like the\r\nAmerica Sings geese that had all their skin removed and found a new\r\nhome as smart-talking robots in the pre-show for the old Star Tours.\r\n\r\nBut now it all could be printed to order, fabbed and shipped in. They\r\nweren't even doing their own machining at Imagineering anymore -- that\r\nwas all mail-order fulfillment. Just email a three-d drawing to a shop\r\nand you'd have as many as you wanted the next day, FedEx\r\nguaranteed. Sammy's lips drew back from his teeth as he considered the\r\npossibility that the Wal-Mart ride people had ordered their parts from\r\nthe same suppliers. Christ on a bike, what a mess.\r\n\r\nAnd there, in the pit of despair, at the bottom of his downward arc,\r\nSammy was hit by a bolt of inspiration:\r\n\r\nPut Disney into people's living rooms! Put printers into their homes\r\nthat decorated a corner of their rooms with a replica of a different\r\nride every day. You could put it on a coffee table, or scale it up to\r\nfill your basement rumpus-room. You could have a magic room that was a\r\npiece of the park, a souvenir that never let go of Disney, there in\r\nyour home. The people who were willing to spend a fortune on printed\r\nskull finials would cream for this! It would be like actually living\r\nthere, in the park. It would be Imagineering Eye for the Fan Guy.\r\n\r\nHe could think of a hundred ways to turn this into money. Give away\r\nthe printers and sell subscriptions to the refresh. Sell the printers\r\nand give away the refreshes. Charge sponsors to modify the plans and\r\ntarget different product placements to different users. The\r\npossibilities were endless. Best of all, it would extend the reach of\r\nDisney Parks further than the stupid ride could ever go -- it would be\r\nthere, on the coffee table, in the rumpus room, in your school gym or\r\nat your summer place.\r\n\r\nHe loved it. Loved it! He actually laughed aloud. What a *great* idea!\r\nSure he was in trouble -- big trouble. But if he could get this thing\r\ngoing -- and it would go, *fast* -- then Hackelberg would get his\r\nback. The lawyer didn't give a shit if Sammy lived or died, but he\r\nwould do anything to protect the company's interests.\r\n\r\nSure, no one from Imagineering had been willing to help him design new\r\nrides. They all had all the new ride design projects they could\r\nuse. Audience research too. But this was new, *new new*, not old new,\r\nand new was always appealing to a certain kind of novelty junkie in\r\nImagineering. He'd find help for this, and then he'd pull together a\r\nbusiness-plan, and a timeline, and a critical path, and he'd start\r\nexecuting. He wanted a prototype out the door in a week. Christ, it\r\ncouldn't be that hard -- those Wal-Mart ride assholes had published\r\nthe full schematics for their toys already. He could just rip them\r\noff. Turnabout is fair play, after all.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nHilda left Perry after a couple hours working the ticket-booth\r\ntogether. She wanted to go for a shower and a bit of an explore, and\r\nit was a secret relief to both of them to get some time apart after\r\nall that time living in each others' pockets. They were intimate\r\nstrangers still, not yet attuned to each others' moods and needs for\r\nprivacy, and a little separation was welcome.\r\n\r\nWelcome, too, was Perry's old post there at the ticket counter, like\r\nLucy's lemonade stand in Peanuts. The riders came on thick, a\r\nsurprising number of them knew his name and wanted to know how his arm\r\nwas. They were all watching the drama unfold online. They knew about\r\nthe Brazilian rides coming online and the patch Lester had run. They\r\nall felt a proprietary interest in this thing. It made him feel good,\r\nbut a little weird. He could deal with having friends, and customers,\r\nbut fans?\r\n\r\nWhen he got off work, he wandered over to the shantytown with a bunch\r\nof the vendors, to have a customary after-work beer and plate of\r\nribs. He was about to get his phone out and find Hilda when he spotted\r\nher, gnawing on a greasy bone with Suzanne and Eva.\r\n\r\n\"Well, *hello*!\" he said, delighted, skipping around the barbecue pit\r\nto collect a greasy kiss from Hilda, and more chaste but equally\r\ngreasy pecks on the cheek from Suzanne and Eva. \"Looks like you've\r\nfound the best place in town!\"\r\n\r\n\"We thought we'd show her around,\" Suzanne said. She and Eva had\r\npositioned each other on either side of Hilda, using her as a buffer,\r\nbut it was great to see that they were on something like speaking\r\nterms. Perry had no doubt that Suzanne hadn't led Kettlewell on (they\r\nall had crushes on her, he knew it), but that didn't mean that Eva\r\nwouldn't resent her anyway. If their positions were reversed, he would\r\nhave had a hard time controlling his jealousy.\r\n\r\n\"They've been wonderful,\" Hilda said, offering him a rib. He\r\nintroduced her to the market-stall sellers who'd come over with him\r\nand there was more greasy handshaking and hugging, and the proprietor\r\nof the joint started handing around more ribs, more beers, and someone\r\nbrought out a set of speakers and suction-cupped their\r\ninduction-surfaces to a nearby wall, and Perry dropped one of his\r\nearbuds into them and set it to shuffle and they had music.\r\n\r\nKids ran past them in shrieking hordes, playing some kind of big game\r\nthat they'd all been obsessed with. Perry saw that Ada and Lyenitchka\r\nwere with them, clutching brightly colored mobiles and trying to read\r\ntheir screens while running away from another gang of kids who were\r\nclearly \"it,\" taking exaggerated care not to run into invisible\r\nobstacles indicated on the screens.\r\n\r\n\"It was great to get back into the saddle,\" Perry said, digging into\r\nsome ribs, getting sauce on his fingers. \"I had no idea how much I'd\r\nbeen missing it.\"\r\n\r\nHilda nodded. \"I could tell, anyway. You're a junkie for it. You're\r\nlike the ones who show up all googly-eyed about the 'story' that's\r\nsupposedly in there. You act like that's a holy box.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne nodded solemnly. \"She's right. The two of you, you and Lester,\r\nyou're so into that thing, you're the biggest fanboys in the\r\nworld. You know what they call it, the fans, when they get together to\r\nchat about the stuff they love? Drooling. As in, 'Did you see the\r\ndrool I posted this morning about the new girl's bedroom scene?' You\r\ndrool like no one's business when you talk about that thing. It's a\r\nholy thing for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You guys sound like you've been comparing notes,\" Perry said, making\r\nhis funny eyebrow dance.\r\n\r\nEva arched one of her fine, high eyebrows in response. In some ways,\r\nshe was the most beautiful of all of them, the most self-assured and\r\npoised. \"Of course we were, sonny. Your young lady here needed to know\r\nthat you aren't an axe-murderer.\" The women's camaraderie was almost\r\npalpable. Suzanne and Eva had clearly patched up whatever differences\r\nthey'd had, which was probably bad news for Kettlewell.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Lester, anyway?\" He hadn't planned on asking, but Suzanne's\r\nmention of his name led him to believe he could probably get away with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"He's talking to Brazil,\" Suzanne said. \"It's all he's done, all day\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\nTalking to Brazil. Wow. Perry'd thought of Brazil as a kind of\r\nabstract thing, fifty rogue nodes on the network that had necessitated\r\na hurried software patch. Not as a bunch of people. But of course,\r\nthere they were, in Brazil, real people by the dozens, maybe even\r\nhundreds, building rides.\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't speak Spanish, though,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"Neither do they, dork,\" Hilda said, giving him an elbow in the\r\nribs. \"Portuguese.\"\r\n\r\n\"They all speak some English and he's using automated translation\r\nstuff for the hard concepts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does that work? I mean, any time I've tried to translate a web-page\r\nin Japanese or Hebrew, it's kind of read like noun noun noun noun verb\r\nnoun random.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne shook her head. \"That's how most of the world experiences most\r\nof the net, Perry. Anglos are just about the only people on earth who\r\ndon't read the net in languages other than their own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, good for Lester then,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSuzanne made a sour face that let him know that whatever peace\r\nprevailed between her and Lester, it was fragile. \"Good for him,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Where are the boys?\"\r\n\r\n\"Landon and Tjan have them,\" Eva said. \"They've been holed up with\r\nyour lawyers going over strategy with them. When I walked out, they\r\nwere trying to get the firm's partners to take shares in the\r\ncorporation that owns the settlement in lieu of cash up front.\"\r\n\r\n\"Man that's all too weird for me,\" Perry said. \"I wish we could just\r\nrun this thing like a business: make stuff people want to give us\r\nmoney for, collect the money, and spend it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are such a nerd fatalist,\" Suzanne said. \"Getting involved in the\r\nmore abstract elements of commerce doesn't make you into a suit. If\r\nyou don't participate and take an interest, you'll always be\r\nout-competed by those who do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bull,\" Perry said. \"They can get a court to order us to make pi equal\r\nto three, or to ensure that other people don't make Mickey heads in\r\ntheir rides, or that our riders don't think of Disney when they get\r\ninto one of our chairs, but they'll never be able to enforce it.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne suddenly whirled on him. \"Perry Gibbons, you aren't that\r\nstupid, so stop acting like you are.\" She touched his cast. \"Look at\r\nthis thing on your arm. Your superior technology can *not* make\r\ninferior laws irrelevant. You're assuming that the machinery of state\r\nis unwilling to completely shut you down in order to make you comply\r\nwith some minor law. You're totally wrong. They'll come after you and\r\nbreak your head.\"\r\n\r\nPerry rocked back on his heels. He was suddenly furious, even if\r\nsomewhere in his heart of hearts he knew that she was right and he was\r\nmostly angry at being shown up in front of Hilda. \"I've been hearing\r\nthat all my life, Suzanne. I don't buy it. Look, it just keeps getting\r\ncheaper and easier to make something like what we've built. To get a\r\nprinter, to get goop, to make stuff, to download stuff, to message and\r\nIM with people who'll help you make stuff. To learn how to make\r\nit. Look, the world is getting better because we're getting better at\r\nrouting around the bullies. We can play their game, or we can invent a\r\nnew game.\r\n\r\n\"I refuse to be sucked into playing their game. If we play their game,\r\nwe end up just like them.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne shook her head sadly. \"It's a good thing you've got Tjan and\r\nKettlewell around then, to do the dirty work. I just hope you can\r\nspare them a little pity from atop your moral high-ground.\"\r\n\r\nShe took Eva by the arm and led her away, leaving Perry, shaking, with\r\nHilda.\r\n\r\n\"Bitch,\" he said, kicking the ground. He balled his hands into fists\r\nand then quickly relaxed them as his broken arm ground and twinged\r\nfrom the sudden tensing.\r\n\r\nHilda took him by the arm. \"You two clearly have a *lot* of history.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a couple deep breaths. \"She was so out of line there. What the\r\nhell, anyway? Why should I have to --\" He stopped. He could tell when\r\nhe was repeating himself.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that she would be telling you that stuff if she didn't\r\nthink you needed to hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You sound like you're on her side. I thought you were a fiery young\r\nrevolutionary. You think we should all put on suits and incorporate?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that if you've got skilled people willing to help you, you\r\nowe it to them to value their contribution. I've heard you complain\r\nabout 'suits' twenty times in the past week. Two of those suits are on\r\nyour side. They're putting themselves on the line, just like\r\nyou. Hell, they're doing the shit-work while you get to do all the\r\ninventing and fly around the country and get laid by hot groupies.\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed his cheek, trying to make a joke of it, but she'd really\r\nhurt his feelings. He felt like weeping. It was all out of his\r\ncontrol. His destiny was not his to master.\r\n\r\n\"OK, let's go apologize to Kettlewell and Tjan.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed, but he'd only been halfway kidding. What he really wanted\r\nto do was have a big old dinner at home with Lester, just the two of\r\nthem in front of the TV, eating Lester's fatkins cuisine, planning a\r\nnew invention. He was tired of all these people. Even Suzanne was an\r\noutsider. It had just been him and Lester in the old days, and those\r\nhad been the best days.\r\n\r\nHilda put her arm around his shoulders and nuzzled his neck. \"Poor\r\nPerry,\" she said. \"Everyone picks on him.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, sulkypants, let's go find Lester and he can call me 'Yoko'\r\nsome more. That always cheers you up.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nIt was two weeks before Death Waits could sit up and prod at a\r\nkeyboard with his broken hands. Some of his pals brought a laptop\r\naround and they commandeered a spare dining tray to keep it on --\r\nDeath's lap was in no shape to support anything heavy with sharp\r\ncorners.\r\n\r\nThe first day, he was reduced to tears of frustration within minutes\r\nof starting. He couldn't use the shift key, couldn't really use the\r\nmouse -- and the meds made it hard to concentrate and remember what\r\nhe'd done.\r\n\r\nBut there were people on the other end of that computer, human friends\r\nwhom he could communicate with if only he could re-learn to use this\r\ntool that he'd lived with since he was old enough to sit up on his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nSo laboriously, peck by peck, key by key, he learned to use it\r\nagain. The machine had a mode for disabled people, for *cripples*, and\r\nonce he hit on this, it went faster. The mode tried to learn from him,\r\nlearn his tremors and mis-keys, his errors and cursing, and so emerge\r\nsomething that was uniquely his interface. It was a kind of a game to\r\nwatch the computer try to guess what was meant by his mashed\r\nkeystrokes and spastic pointer-movements -- he turned on the webcam\r\nand aimed it at his eye, and switched it to retinal scanner mode,\r\ngiving it control of the pointer, then watched in amusement as the\r\nwild leaping of the cursor every time a needle or a broken bone\r\nshifted inside his body was becalmed into a graceful, normalized\r\ncurve.\r\n\r\nIt was humiliating to be a high-tech cripple and the better the\r\ntechnology worked, the more prone it was to reducing him to tears. He\r\nmight be like this for the rest of his life. He might never walk\r\nwithout a limp again. Might never dance. Might never be able to reach\r\nfor and lift objects again. He'd never find a woman, never have a\r\nfamily, never have grandkids.\r\n\r\nBut this was offset by the real people with their real chatter. He\r\nobsessively flew through the Brazilian mode, strange and wonderful but\r\nnowhere near what he loved from \"his\" variation on the ride. He could\r\nroll through all the different changes he'd made with his friends to\r\nthe ride in Florida, and he became subtly attuned to which elements\r\nwere wrong and which were right.\r\n\r\nIt was on one of these flythroughs that he encountered The Story,\r\nleaping out of the ride so vividly that he yelped like he'd flexed his\r\nIV into a nerve again.\r\n\r\nThere it was -- irrefutable and indefinable. When you rode through\r\nthere was an escalating tension, a sense of people who belonged to\r\nthese exhibits going through hard changes, growing up and out.\r\n\r\nOnce he'd seen it, he couldn't un-see it. When he and his pals had\r\nstarted to add their own stuff to the ride, the story people had been\r\ngiant pains in the ass, accusing them of something they called\r\n\"narricide\" -- destroying the fragile story that humanity had laid\r\nbare there.\r\n\r\nNow that he'd seen it too, he wanted to protect it. But he could see\r\nby skimming forward and back through the change-log and trying\r\ndifferent flythroughs that the story wasn't being undermined by the\r\ngoth stuff they were bringing in; it was being enhanced. It was\r\ntelling the story he knew, of growing up with an indefinable need to\r\nbe *different*, to reject the mainstream and to embrace this\r\nsubculture and aesthetic.\r\n\r\nIt was the story of his tribe and sub-species and it got realer the\r\nmore he played it. God, how could he have *missed it*? It made him\r\nwant to cry, though that might have been the meds. Some of it made him\r\nwant to laugh, too.\r\n\r\nHe tried, laboriously, to compose a message-board post that expressed\r\nwhat he was feeling, but every attempt came out sounding like those\r\nstory mystics he'd battled. He understood now why they'd sounded so\r\nhippy-trippy.\r\n\r\nSo he rode the ride, virtually, again and again, spotting the\r\ngrace-notes and the sly wit and the wrenching emotion that the\r\ncollective intelligence of all those riders had created. Discovered?\r\nIt was like the story was there all along, lurking like the statue\r\ninside a block of marble.\r\n\r\nOh, it was wonderful. He was ruined, maybe forever, but it was\r\nwonderful. And he'd been a part of it.\r\n\r\nHe went back to writing that message-board post. He'd be laid in that\r\nbed for a long time yet. He had time to rewrite.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nIF YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM, RIP THEM OFF\r\n\r\nA new initiative from the troubled Disney Parks corporation shows how\r\na little imagination can catapult an ambitious exec to the top of the\r\ncorporate ladder.\r\n\r\nWord has it that Samuel R.D. Page, the Vice President for Fantasyland\r\n(I assure you, I am NOT making that up) has been kicked upstairs to\r\nSenior Vice President for Remote Delivery of Park Experience (I'm not\r\nmaking that up, either). Insiders in the company tell us that \"Remote\r\nDelivery of Park Experience\" is a plan to convince us to give The\r\nMouse a piece of our homes which will be constantly refreshed via a\r\nrobot three-dimensional printer with miniatures of the Disney park.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds familiar, it should. It's a pale imitation of the\r\nno-less-ridiculous (if slightly less evil) \"rides\" movement pioneered\r\nby Perry Gibbons and Lester Banks, previously the anti-heroes of the\r\nNew Work pump-and-dump scandal.\r\n\r\nImitation is meant to be the sincerest form of flattery, and if so,\r\nGibbons and his cultists must be blushing fire-engine red.\r\n\r\nThis is cheap irony, Disney-style. After all, it's only been a month\r\nsince the company launched ten separate lawsuits against various\r\nincarnations of the ride for trademark violation, and it's now trying\r\nto duck the punishing countersuits that have risen up in their wake.\r\n\r\nMost ironic of all, word has it that Page was responsible for both\r\nends of this: the lawsuits against the ride and the decision to turn\r\nhis company into purveyors of cheap knockoffs of the ride.\r\n\r\nPage is best known among Park aficionados for having had the\r\n\"foresight\" to gut the children's \"Fantasyland\" district in Walt\r\nDisney World and replace it with a jumped up version of Hot Topic, a\r\ngoth-themed area that drew down the nation's eyeliner supply to\r\ndangerously low levels.\r\n\r\nIt was apparently that sort of \"way-out-of-the-box\" \"genius\" that led\r\nPage to his latest round of disasters: the lawsuits, an abortive\r\nrebuilding of Fantasyland, and now this \"Remote Delivery\" scam.\r\n\r\nWhat's next? The Mouse has already shipped Disney Dollars, an abortive\r\nhome-wares line, a disastrous fine-art chain, and oversaw the collapse\r\nof the collectible cel-art market. With \"visionaries\" like Page at the\r\nhelm, the company can't help but notch up more \"successes.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDeath was deep into the story now. The Brazilians had forked off their\r\nown ride -- they'd had their own New Work culture, too, centered in\r\nthe favelas, so they had different stories to tell. Some of the ride\r\noperators imported a few of their scenes, tentatively, and some of the\r\nride fans were recreating the Brazil scenes on their own passes\r\nthrough the ride.\r\n\r\nIt was all in there, if you knew where to look for it, and the best\r\npart was, no one had written it. It had written itself. The collective\r\njudgement of people who rode through had turned chaos into coherence.\r\n\r\nOr had it? The message-boards were rife with speculation that The\r\nStory had been planted by someone -- maybe the ride's creators, maybe\r\nsome clan of riders -- who'd inserted it deliberately. These\r\ndiscussions bordered on the metaphysical: what was an \"organic\" ride\r\ndecision? It made Death Waits's head swim.\r\n\r\nThe thing that was really doing his head in, though, was the Disney\r\nstuff. Sammy -- he couldn't even think of Sammy without a sick feeling\r\nin his stomach, crashing waves of nausea that transcended even his\r\nnarcotic haze -- Sammy was making these grotesque parodies of the\r\nride. He was pushing them out to the world's living rooms. Even the\r\ndeleted rides from the glory days of the goth Fantasyland, in\r\ntime-limited miniature. If he'd still been at Disney Parks, he would\r\nhave loved this idea. It was just what he loved, the knowledge that he\r\nwas sharing experience with his people around the world, part of a\r\ntribe even if he couldn't see them.\r\n\r\nNow, in the era of the ride, he could see how dumb this was. How thin\r\nand shallow and commercial. Why should they have to pay some giant\r\nevil corporation to convene their community?\r\n\r\nHe kept trying to write about The Story, kept failing. It wouldn't\r\ncome. But Sammy -- he knew what he wanted to say about Sammy. He typed\r\nuntil they sedated him, and then typed some more when he woke up. He\r\nhad old emails to refer to. He pasted them in.\r\n\r\nAfter three days of doing this, the lawyer came back. Tom Levine was\r\ndressed in a stern suit with narrow lapels and a tie pierced with some\r\nkind of frat pin. He wasn't much older than Death, but he made Death\r\nfeel like a little kid.\r\n\r\n\"I need to talk to you about your Internet activity,\" he said, sitting\r\ndown beside him. He'd brought along a salt-water taffy assortment\r\nbought from the roadside, cut into double-helix molecules and other\r\nodd biological forms -- an amoeba, a skeleton.\r\n\r\n\"OK?\" Death said. They'd switched him to something new for the pain\r\nthat day, and given him a rocker-switch he could use to drizzle it\r\ninto his IV when it got bad. He'd hit it just before the lawyer came\r\nto see him and now he couldn't concentrate much. Plus he wasn't used\r\nto talking. Writing online was better. He could write something, save\r\nit, go back and re-read it later and clean it up if it turned out he'd\r\ngone off on a stoned ramble.\r\n\r\n\"You know we're engaged in some very high-stakes litigation here,\r\nright, Darren?\"\r\n\r\nHe hated it when people called him Darren.\r\n\r\n\"Death,\" he said. His toothless lisp was pathetic, like an old wino's.\r\n\r\n\"Death, OK. This high-stakes litigation needs a maximum of caution and\r\ncontrol. This is a fifteen-year journey that ends when we've broken\r\nthe back of the company that did this to you. It ends when we take\r\nthem for every cent, bankrupt their executives, take their summer\r\nhomes, freeze their accounts. You understand that?\"\r\n\r\nDeath hadn't really understood that. It sounded pretty\r\ntiring. Exhausting. Fifteen years. He was only nineteen now. He'd be\r\nthirty-four, and that was only if the lawyer was estimating correctly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, not that you're going to have to take part in fifteen years'\r\nworth of this. It's likely we'll be done with your part in a year,\r\ntops. But the point is that when you go online and post material\r\nthat's potentially harmful to this case --\"\r\n\r\nDeath closed his eyes. He'd posted the wrong thing. This had been a\r\nmajor deal when he was at Disney, what he was and wasn't allowed to\r\npost about -- though in practice, he'd posted about everything,\r\nsticking the private stuff in private discussions.\r\n\r\n\"Look, you can't write about the case, or anything involved with it,\r\nthat's what it comes down to. If you write about that stuff and you\r\nsay the wrong thing, you could blow this whole suit. They'd get away\r\nclean.\"\r\n\r\nDeath shook his head. Not write about it at *all*?\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said. \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not asking you, Death. I can get a court order if I have to. This\r\nis serious -- it's not some funny little game. There are billions on\r\nthe line here. One wrong word, one wrong post and *pfft*, it's all\r\nover. And nothing in email, either -- it's likely everything you write\r\nis going to go through discovery. Don't write anything personal in any\r\nof your mail -- nothing you wouldn't want in a court record.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't do that,\" Death said. He sounded like a fucking retard,\r\nbetween talking through his mashed mouth and talking through the\r\ntears. \"I can't. I live in email.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now you'll have a reason to go outside. This isn't up for\r\nnegotiation. When I was here last, I thought I made the seriousness of\r\nthis case clear to you. I'm frankly amazed that you were immature and\r\nirresponsible enough to write what I've read.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't --\" Death said.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer purpled. He didn't look like a happy-go-lucky tanned\r\npreppie anymore. He looked Dad-scary, like one of those fathers in\r\nDisney who was about to seriously lose his shit and haul off and smack\r\na whiny kid. Death's own Pawpaw, who'd stood in for his father, had\r\ngone red like that whenever he \"mouthed off,\" a sin that could be\r\ncommitted even without opening his mouth. He had an instinctive\r\ncurl-up-and-hide reaction to it, and the lawyer seemed to sense this,\r\nlooming over him. He felt like he was about to be eaten.\r\n\r\n\"You listen to me, *Darren* -- this is not the kind of thing you fuck\r\nup. This isn't something *I'm* going to fuck up. I win my cases and\r\nyou're not going to change that. There's too much at stake here for\r\nyou to blow it all with your childish, selfish --\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to catch himself then, and he snorted a hot breath through\r\nhis nose that blew over Death's face. \"Listen, there's a lot on the\r\nline here. More money than you or I are worth. I'm trying to help you\r\nout here. Whatever you write, whatever you say, it's going to be very\r\nclosely scrutinized. From now on, you should treat every piece of\r\ninformation that emanates from your fingertips as likely to be covered\r\non the evening news and repeated to everyone you've ever met. No\r\nmatter how private you think you're being, it'll come out. It's not\r\npretty, and I know you didn't ask for it, but you're here, and there's\r\nnothing you can do to change that.\r\n\r\nHe left then, embarrassed at losing his temper, embarrassed at Death's\r\nmeek silence. Death poked at his laptop some. He thought about writing\r\ndown more notes, but that was probably in the same category.\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes and now, *now* he felt the extent of his injuries,\r\nfelt them truly for the first time since he'd woken up in this\r\nhospital. There were deep, grinding pains in his legs -- both knees\r\nbroken, fracture in the left thigh. His ribs hurt every time he\r\nbreathed. His face was a ruin, his mouth felt like he had twisted\r\nlumps of hamburger glued to his torn lips. His dick -- well, they'd\r\ncatheterized him, but that didn't account for the feelings down\r\nthere. He'd been kicked repeatedly and viciously, and they told him\r\nthat the reconstructive surgeries -- surgeries, plural -- would take\r\nsome time, and nothing was certain until they were done.\r\n\r\nHe'd managed to pretend that his body wasn't there for so long as he\r\nwas able to poke at the computer. Now it came back to him. He had the\r\npainkiller rocker-switch and the pain wasn't any worse than what\r\npassed for normal, but he had an idea that if he hit it enough times,\r\nhe'd be able to get away from his body for a while again.\r\n\r\nHe tried it.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nHilda and Lester sat uncomfortably on the sofa next to each\r\nother. Perry had hoped they'd hit it off, but it was clear after\r\nLester tried his Yoko joke again that the chemistry wasn't there. Now\r\nthey were having a rare moment of all-look-same-screen, the TV\r\nswitched on like in an old comedy, no one looking at their own laptop.\r\n\r\nThe tension was thick, and Perry was sick of it.\r\n\r\nHe reached for his computer and asked it to find him the baseball\r\ngloves. Two of the drawers on the living-room walls glowed pink. He\r\nfetched the gloves down, tossed one to Lester, and picked up his ball.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" he said. \"TV is historically accurate, but it's not very\r\nsocial.\"\r\n\r\nLester got up from the sofa, a slow smile spreading on his face, and\r\nHilda followed a minute later. Outside, by the cracked pool, it was\r\ncoming on slow twilight and that magic, tropical blood-orange sky like\r\na swirl of sorbet.\r\n\r\nLester and Perry each put on their gloves. Perry'd worn his now and\r\nagain, but had never had a real game of catch with it. Lester lobbed\r\nan easy toss to him and when it smacked his glove, it felt so *right*,\r\nthe sound and the vibration and the fine cloud of dust that rose up\r\nfrom the mitt's pocket, Christ, it was like a sacrament.\r\n\r\nHe couldn't lob the ball back, because of his busted wing, so he\r\nhanded the ball to Hilda. \"You're my designated right arm,\" he\r\nsaid. She smiled and chucked the ball back to Lester.\r\n\r\nThey played until the twilight deepened to velvety warm dark and\r\nhumming bugs and starlight. Each time he caught a ball, something left\r\nPerry, some pain long held in his chest, evanesced into the night\r\nair. His catching arm, stiff from being twisted by the weight of the\r\ncast on his other hand, unlimbered and became fluid. His mind was\r\nbecalmed.\r\n\r\nNone of them talked, though they sometimes laughed when a ball went\r\nwild, and both Perry and Lester went \"ooh,\" when Lester made a\r\njump-catch that nearly tumbled him into the dry pool.\r\n\r\nPerry hadn't played a game of catch since he was a kid. Catch wasn't\r\nhis dad's strong suit, and he and his friends had liked video-games\r\nbetter than tossing a ball, which was pretty dull by comparison.\r\n\r\nBut that night it was magic, and when it got to full dark and they\r\ncould barely see the ball except as a second moon hurtling white\r\nthrough the air, they kept tossing it a few more times before Perry\r\ndropped it into the pocket of his baggy shorts. \"Let's get a drink,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nLester came over and gave him a big, bearish hug. Then Hilda joined\r\nthem. \"You stink,\" Lester said, \"Seriously, dude. Like the ass of a\r\ndead bear.\"\r\n\r\nThat broke them up and set them to laughing together, a giggling fit\r\nthat left them gasping, Lester on all fours. Perry's arm forgot to\r\nhurt and he moved to kiss Hilda on the cheek and instead she turned\r\nher head to kiss him full on the lips, a real juicy, steamy one that\r\nmade his ear-wax melt.\r\n\r\n\"Drinks,\" Hilda said, breaking the kiss.\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs, holding the mitts, and had a beer together on the\r\npatio, talking softly about nothing in particular, and then Lester\r\nhugged them good night and then they all went to bed, and Perry put\r\nhis face into the hair at the back of Hilda's neck and told her he\r\nloved her, and Hilda snuggled up to him and they fell asleep.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nA GAME OF CATCH\r\n\r\nPop-quiz: Your empire is crumbling around your ears. Your supporters\r\nare hospitalized by jackboot thugs for sticking up for you.\r\n\r\nThe lawsuits are mounting and fly-by-night MBAs have determined to use\r\nyour non-profit, info-hippie ride project to get right by embarking on\r\n20 years of litigation.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n\r\nWell, if you're like Perry Gibbons, Lester Banks and Hilda Hammersen,\r\nyou go out into the backyard and throw a ball around for a while, then\r\nyou have a big cuddle and head inside.\r\n\r\nThe pictures shown here were captured by a neighbor of the cult\r\nleaders last night, at their palatial condos in Hollywood, Florida.\r\n\r\nThe three are ring-leaders of the loose-knit organization that manages\r\nthe \"rides\" that dot ten cities in America and are present in fifty\r\ncities in Brazil. Their project came to national attention when Disney\r\nbrought suit against them, securing injunctions against the rides that\r\nresulted in riots and bloodshed.\r\n\r\nOne supporter of the group, the outspoken \"Death Waits,\" a former\r\nDisney employee, has been hospitalized for over a week following a\r\nsavage beating that he claims resulted from his Internet posting about\r\nthe unhealthy obsession Disney executive Samuel R.D. Page (see\r\nprevious coverage) bore for the ride.\r\n\r\nEveryone needs to unwind now and then, but sources at the hospital\r\nwhere Death Waits lies abed say that he has had no visits from the\r\ncult leaders since he took his beating in their service.\r\n\r\nNo doubt these three have more important things to do -- like play\r\ncatch.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSuzanne said, \"Look, you can't let crazy people set your agenda. If\r\nyou want to visit this Death kid, you should. If you don't, you\r\nshouldn't. But don't let Freddy psy-ops you into doing something you\r\ndon't want to do. Maybe he does have a rat in your building. Maybe\r\nhe's got a rat at the hospital. Maybe, though, he just scored some\r\nstills off a flickr stream, maybe he's watching new photos with some\r\nface-recognition stuff.\"\r\n\r\nPerry looked up from his screen, still scowling. \"People do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure -- stalkerware! I use it myself, just to see what photos of me\r\nare showing up online. I scour every photo-feed published for anything\r\nthat appears to be a photo of me. Most of it's from blogjects, CCTV\r\ncameras and crap like that. You should see what it's like on days I go\r\nto London -- you can get photographed 800 times a day there without\r\ntrying. So yeah, if I was Freddy and I wanted to screw with you, I'd\r\nbe watching every image feed for your pic, and mine, and Lester's. We\r\njust need to assume that that's going on. But look at what he actually\r\nreported on: you went out and played catch and then hugged after your\r\ngame. It's not like he caught you cornholing gators while smoking\r\nspliffs rolled in C-notes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that guy have against us, anyway?\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne sighed. \"Well, at first I think it was that *I* liked you, and\r\nthat you were trying to do something consistent with what he thought\r\neveryone should be doing. After all, if anyone were to follow his\r\nexhortations, they'd have to be dumb enough to be taking him\r\nseriously, and for that they deserve all possible disapprobation.\r\n\r\n\"These days, though, he hates you for two reasons. The first is that\r\nyou failed, which means that you've got to have some kind of moral\r\ndeficiency. The second is that we keep pulling his pants down in\r\npublic, which makes him even angrier, since pulling down people's\r\npants is *his* job.\r\n\r\n\"I know it's armchair psychology, but I think that Freddy just doesn't\r\nlike himself very much. At the end of the day, people who are secure\r\nand happy don't act like this.\"\r\n\r\nPerry's scowl deepened. \"I'd like to kick him in the fucking balls,\"\r\nhe said. \"Why can't he just let us be? We've got enough frigging\r\nproblems.\"\r\n\r\n\"I just want to go and visit this kid,\" Lester said, and they were\r\nback where they started.\r\n\r\n\"But we know that this Freddy guy has an informant in the hospital, he\r\nabout says as much in this article. If we go there, he wins,\" Perry\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHilda and Lester just looked at him. Finally he smiled and\r\nrelented. \"OK, Freddy isn't going to run my life. If it's the right\r\nthing to visit this kid, it's the right thing. Let's do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll go after the ride shuts tonight,\" Lester said. \"All of us. I'll\r\nbuy him a fruit basket and bring him a mini.\" The minis were Lester's\r\nlatest mechanical computers, built inside of sardine cans, made of\r\nminiaturized, printed, high-impact alloys. They could add and subtract\r\nnumbers up to ten, using a hand crank on the side, registering their\r\noutput on a binary display of little windows that were covered and\r\nuncovered by tiny shutters. He'd built his first the day before, using\r\ndesigns supplied by some of his people in Brazil and tweaking them to\r\nhis liking.\r\n\r\nThe day was as close to a normal day on the ride as Perry could\r\nimagine. The crowd was heavy from the moment he opened, and he had to\r\ngo back into the depths and kick things back into shape a couple\r\ntimes, and one of the chairs shut down, and two of the merchants had a\r\ndispute that degenerated into a brawl. Just another day running a\r\nroadside attraction in Florida.\r\n\r\nLester spelled him off for the end of the day, then they counted the\r\ntake and said good night to the merchants and all piled into one of\r\nLester's cars and headed for the hospital.\r\n\r\n\"You liking Florida?\" Lester called over the seat as they inched\r\nforward in the commuter traffic on the way into Melbourne.\r\n\r\n\"It's hot; I like that,\" Hilda said.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't mention the awesome aesthetics,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\nSuzanne rolled her eyes. \"Ticky-tacky chic,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I love it here,\" Lester said. \"That contrast between crass,\r\noverdeveloped, cheap, nasty strip-malls and unspoiled tropical\r\nbeauty. It's gorgeous *and* it tickles my funny bone.\"\r\n\r\nHilda squinted out the window as though she were trying to see what\r\nLester saw, like someone staring at a random-dot stereogram in a\r\nmall-store, trying to make the three-d image pop out.\r\n\r\n\"If you say so,\" she said. \"I don't find much attractive about human\r\nsettlement, though. If it needs to be there, it should just be\r\ninvisible as possible. We fundamentally live in ugly boxes, and\r\nefforts to make them pretty never do anything for me except call\r\nattention to how ugly they are. I kinda wish that everything was built\r\nto disappear as much as possible so we could concentrate on the\r\nloveliness of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"You get that in Madison?\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"Nope,\" she said. \"I've never seen any place designed the way I'd\r\ndesign one. Maybe I'll do that someday.\"\r\n\r\nPerry loved her just then, for that. The casual \"oh, yeah, the world\r\nisn't arranged to my satisfaction, maybe I'll rearrange it someday.\"\r\n\r\nThe duty-nurse was a bored Eastern European who gave them a\r\nhalf-hearted hard time about having too many people visit Death Waits\r\nall at once, but who melted when Suzanne gave her a little talk in\r\nRussian.\r\n\r\n\"What was that all about?\" Perry whispered to her as they made their\r\nway along the sour-smelling ward.\r\n\r\n\"Told her we would keep it down -- and complimented her on her\r\nmanicure.\"\r\n\r\nLester shook his head. \"I haven't been in a place like this in so\r\nlong. The fatkins places are nothing like it.\"\r\n\r\nHilda snorted. \"More upscale, I take it?\" Lester and Hilda hadn't\r\nreally talked about the fatkins thing, but Perry suddenly remembered\r\nthe vehemence with which Hilda had denounced the kids who were talked\r\ninto fatkins treatments in their teens and wondered if she and Lester\r\nshould be clearing the air.\r\n\r\n\"Not really -- but more functional. More about, I don't know, pursuing\r\nyour hobby. Less about showing up in an emergency.\"\r\n\r\nHilda snorted again and they were at Death's room. They walked past\r\nhis roommates, an old lady with her teeth out, sleeping with her jaw\r\nsagging down, and a man in a body-cast hammering on a video-game\r\ncontroller and staring fixedly at the screen at the foot of his bed.\r\n\r\nThen they came upon Death Waits. Perry had only seen him briefly, and\r\nin bad shape even then, but now he was a wreck, something from a\r\nhorror movie or an atrocity photo. Perry swallowed hard as he took in\r\nthe boy's wracked, skinny body, the casts, the sunken eyes, the shaved\r\nhead, the caved-in face and torn ears.\r\n\r\nHe was fixedly watching TV, which seemed to be showing a golf\r\nshow. His thumb was poised over a rocker-switch connected to the IV in\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\nDeath looked at them with dull eyes at first, not recognizing them for\r\na moment. Then he did, and his eyes welled up with tears. They\r\nstreamed down his face and his chin and lip quivered, and then he\r\nopened his mouth and started to bawl like a baby.\r\n\r\nPerry was paralyzed -- transfixed by this crying wreck. Lester, too,\r\nand Suzanne. They all took a minute step backward, but Hilda pushed\r\npast them and took his hand and stroked his hair and went *shhh*,\r\n*shhh*. His bawling become more uncontrolled, louder, and his two\r\nroommates complained, calling to him to shut up, and Suzanne moved\r\nback and drew the curtains around each of their beds. Strangely, this\r\nsilenced them.\r\n\r\nGradually, Death's cries became softer, and then he snuffled and\r\nsnorted and Hilda gave him a kleenex from her purse. He wiped his face\r\nand blew his nose and squeezed the kleenex tight in his hand. He\r\nopened his mouth, shut it, opened and shut it.\r\n\r\nThen, in a whisper, he told them his story. The man in the parking-lot\r\nand his erection. The hospital. Posting on the message boards.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"*What*?\" Perry said, loud enough that they all jumped and Death Waits\r\nflinched pathetically in his hospital bed. Hilda squeezed his arm\r\nhard. \"Sorry, sorry,\" Perry muttered. \"But this lawyer, what did he\r\nsay to you?\"\r\n\r\nPerry listened for a time. Death Waits spoke in a low monotone,\r\npausing frequently to draw in shuddering breaths that were almost\r\nsobs.\r\n\r\n\"Fucking *bastards*,\" Perry said. \"Evil, corporate, immoral, sleazy\r\n--\"\r\n\r\nHilda squeezed his arm again. \"Shh,\" she said. \"Take it easy. You're\r\nupsetting him.\"\r\n\r\nPerry was so angry he could barely see, barely think. He was\r\ntrembling, and they were all staring at him, but he couldn't\r\nstop. Death had shrunk back into himself, squeezed his eyes shut.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be back in a minute,\" Perry said. He felt like he was\r\nsuffocating. He walked out of the room so fast it was practically a\r\njog, then pounded on the elevator buttons, waited ten seconds and gave\r\nup and ran down ten flights of stairs. He got outside into the\r\ncoolness of the hazy night and sucked in huge lungsful of wet air, his\r\nheart hammering in his chest.\r\n\r\nHe had his phone in his hand and he had scrolled to Kettlewell's\r\nnumber, but he kept himself from dialing it. He was in no shape to\r\ndiscuss this with Kettlewell. He wanted witnesses there when he did\r\nit, to keep him from doing something stupid.\r\n\r\nHe went back inside. The security guards watched him closely, but he\r\nforced himself to smile and act calm and they didn't stop him from\r\nboarding the elevator.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said to all of them. \"I'm sorry,\" he said to Death\r\nWaits. \"Let me make something very, very clear: you are free to use\r\nthe Internet as much as you want. You are free to tell your story to\r\nanyone you want to tell it to. Even if it screws up my case, you're\r\nfree to do that. You've given up enough for me already.\"\r\n\r\nDeath looked at him with watery eyes. \"Really?\" he said. It came out\r\nin a hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\nPerry moved the breakfast tray that covered Death's laptop, then\r\nopened the laptop and positioned it where Death could reach it. \"It's\r\nall yours, buddy. Whatever you want to say, say it. Let your freak\r\nflag fly.\"\r\n\r\nDeath cried again then, silent tears slipping down his hollow\r\ncheeks. Perry got him some kleenex from the bathroom and he blew his\r\nnose and wiped his face and grinned at them all, a toothless, wet,\r\nruined smile that made Perry's heart lurch. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. What\r\nthe hell was he doing? This kid -- he would never get the life he'd\r\nhad back.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, thank you, thank you,\" Death said.\r\n\r\n\"Please don't be grateful to me,\" Perry said. \"We owe you the thanks\r\naround here. Remember that. We haven't done you any favors. All the\r\nfavors around here have come from you.\r\n\r\n\"Any lawyer shows up here again representing me, I want you to email\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nIn the car back, no one said anything until they were within sight of\r\nthe shantytown. \"Kettlewell isn't going to like this,\" Suzanne said.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I expect not,\" Perry said. \"He can go fuck himself.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nImagineering sent the prototype up to Sammy as soon as it was ready,\r\nthe actual engineers who'd been working on it shlepping it into his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nHe'd been careful to cultivate their friendship through the weeks of\r\nproduction, taking them out for beers and delicately letting them know\r\nthat they were just the sort of people who really understood what\r\nDisney Parks was about, not like those philistines who comprised the\r\nrest of the management layer at Disney. He learned their kids' names\r\nand forwarded jokes to them by email. He dropped by their break-room\r\nand let them beat him at pinball on their gigantic, bizarre,\r\nmulti-board homebrew machine, letting them know just how cool said\r\nmachine was.\r\n\r\nNow it was paying off. Judging from the device he was looking at, a\r\nbreadbox-sized, go-away-green round-shouldered smooth box that it took\r\ntwo of them to carry in.\r\n\r\n\"Watch this,\" one of them said. He knocked a complicated pattern on\r\nthe box's top and a hidden hatch opened out of the side, yawning out\r\nand forming a miniature staircase from halfway down the box's surface\r\nto the ground. There was soft music playing inside the box: a jazzy,\r\nuptempo futuristic version of *When You Wish upon a Star*.\r\n\r\nA little man appeared in the doorway. He looked like he was made of\r\npipe-cleaners and he took the stairs in three wobbling strides. He\r\nignored them as he lurched around the box's perimeter until he came to\r\na far corner, then another hatch slid away and the little man reached\r\ninside and tugged out the plug and the end of the power-cord. He\r\nhugged the plug to his chest and began to wander around Sammy's desk,\r\nclearly looking for an electrical outlet.\r\n\r\n\"It's a random-walk search algorithm,\" one of the Imagineers\r\nsaid. \"Watch this.\" After a couple of circuits of Sammy's desk the\r\nlittle robot went to the edge and jumped, hanging on to the\r\npower-cable, which unspooled slowly from the box like a belay-line,\r\ngently lowering the man to the ground. A few minutes later, he had\r\nfound the electrical outlet and plugged in the box.\r\n\r\nThe music inside stilled and a fanfare began. The trumpeting reached a\r\njoyous peak -- \"It's found a network connection\" -- and then subsided\r\ninto marching-band music. There was a smell like Saran-Wrap in the\r\nmicrowave. A moment later, another pipe-cleaner man emerged from the\r\nbox, lugging a chunk of plastic that looked like the base of a rocket\r\nin an old-timey science fiction movie.\r\n\r\nThe first pipe-cleaner man was shinnying up the power cable. He\r\ncrested the desktop and joined his brother in ferrying out more\r\nparts. Each one snapped into the previous one with a Lego-like\r\n*click*. Taking shape on the desktop in slow stages, the original,\r\n1955 Tomorrowland, complete with the rocket to the moon, the Clock of\r\nthe World and --\r\n\r\n\"Dairy Farmers of America Present the Cow of Tomorrow?\" Sammy said,\r\npeering at the little brass plaque on the matchbox-sized diorama,\r\nwhich showed a cow with an IV in her hock, watching a video of a\r\npasture. \"You're kidding me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" one Imagineer said. \"It's all for real -- the archives have all\r\nthese tight, high-rez three-d models of all the rides the Park's ever\r\nseen. This is totally historically accurate.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser Aluminum Hall of Fame. The Monsanto Hall of\r\nChemistry. Thimble Drome Flight Circle, with tiny flying miniature\r\nairplanes.\r\n\r\n\"Holy crap,\" Sammy said. \"People *paid* to see these things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" the other Imagineer said. \"Take the roof off the Hall of\r\nChemistry.\"\r\n\r\nSammy did, and was treated to a tiny, incredibly detailed three-d\r\nmodel of the Hall's interior exhibits, complete with tiny people in\r\n1950s garb marveling at the truly crappy exhibits.\r\n\r\n\"We print to 1200 dpi with these. We can put pupils on the eyeballs at\r\nthat rez.\"\r\n\r\nThe pieces were still trundling out. Sammy picked up the Monsanto Hall\r\nof Chemistry and turned it over and over in his hands, looking at the\r\nminute detail, admiring the way all the pieces snapped together.\r\n\r\n\"It's kind of brittle,\" the first Imagineer said. He took it from\r\nSammy and gave it a squeeze and it cracked with a noise like an office\r\nchair rolling over a sheet of bubble-wrap. The pieces fell to the\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\nA pipe-cleaner man happened upon a shard after a moment and hugged it\r\nto his chest, then toddled back into the box with it.\r\n\r\n\"There's a little optical scanner in there -- it'll figure out which\r\nbit this piece came from and print another one. Total construction of\r\nthis model takes about two hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"You built this entire thing from scratch in three weeks?\"\r\n\r\nThe Imagineers laughed. \"No, no -- no way! No, almost all the code and\r\ndesigns came off the net. Most of this stuff was developed by New Work\r\nstartups back in the day, or by those ride weirdos down in\r\nHollywood. We just shoved it all into this box and added the models\r\nfor some of our old rides from the archives. This was easy, man --\r\neasy!\"\r\n\r\nSammy's head swam. Easy! This thing was undeniably super-cool. He\r\nwanted one. Everyone was going to want one!\r\n\r\n\"You can print these as big as you want, too -- if we gave it enough\r\ntime, space and feedstock, it'd run these buildings at full size.\"\r\n\r\nThe miniature Tomorrowland was nearly done. It was all brave, sad\r\nwhite curves, like the set of a remake of Rollerball, and featured\r\ntiny people in 1950s clothes, sun-dresses and salaryman hats,\r\nblack-rimmed glasses and scout uniforms for the boys.\r\n\r\nSammy goggled at it. He moved the little people around, lifted off the\r\nlids.\r\n\r\n\"Man, I'd seen the three-d models and flythroughs, but they're nothing\r\ncompared to actually seeing it, owning it. People will want libraries\r\nof these things. Whole rooms devoted to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Umm,\" one of the Imagineers said. Sammy knew his name, but he'd\r\nforgotten it. He had a whole complicated scheme for remembering\r\npeople's names by making up stories about them, but it was a lot of\r\nwork. \"Well, about that. This feedstock is very fast-setting, but it\r\ndoesn't really weather well. Even if you stored it in a dark,\r\nhumidity-controlled room, it'd start to delaminate and fall to pieces\r\nwithin a month or two. Leave it in the living room in direct sunlight\r\nand it'll crumble within a couple days.\"\r\n\r\nSammy pursed his lips and thought for a while. \"Please, please tell me\r\nthat there's something proprietary we can require in the feedstock\r\nthat can make us into the sole supplier of consumables for this\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe? We could certainly tag the goop with something proprietary and\r\nhunt for it when we do the build, refuse to run on anyone else's\r\ngoop. Of course, that won't be hard to defeat --\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll sue anyone who tries it,\" Sammy said. \"Oh, boys, you've outdone\r\nyourselves. Seriously. If I could give you a raise, I would. As it is,\r\ntake something home from the architectural salvage lot and sell it on\r\neBay. It's as close to a bonus as this fucking company's going to pay\r\nany of us.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked at him quizzically, with some alarm and he smiled and\r\nspread his hands. \"Ha ha, only serious boys. Really -- take some stuff\r\nhome. You've earned it. Try and grab something from the ride-system\r\nitself, that's got the highest book-value.\"\r\n\r\nThey left behind a slim folder with production notes and estimates,\r\nsuppliers who would be likely to bid on a job like this. He'd need a\r\nmarketing plan, too -- but this was farther than he ever thought he'd\r\nget. He could show this to legal and to the board, and yes, to Wiener\r\nand the rest of the useless committee. He could get everyone lined up\r\nbehind this and working on it. Hell, if he spun it right they'd all be\r\nfighting to have their pet projects instantiated with it.\r\n\r\nHe fiddled with a couple of overnight shippers' sites for a while,\r\ntrying to figure out what it would cost to sell these in the Park and\r\nhave them waiting on the marks' doorsteps when they got back\r\nhome. There were lots of little details like that, but ultimately,\r\nthis was good and clean -- it would extend the Parks' reach right into\r\nthe living rooms of their customers, giving them a new reason to think\r\nof the Park every day.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nKettlewell and Tjan looked up when Perry banged through the door of\r\nthe tea-house they'd turned into their de facto headquarters.\r\n\r\nPerry had gone through mad and back to calm on the ride home, but as\r\nhe drew closer to the tea-house, passing the people in the streets,\r\nthe people living their lives without lawyers or bullshit, his anger\r\ncame back. He'd even stopped outside the tea-house and breathed\r\ndeeply, but his heart was pounding and his hands kept balling into\r\nfists and sometimes, man, sometimes you've just got to go for it.\r\n\r\nHe got to the table and grabbed the papers there and tossed them over\r\nhis shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"You're fired,\" he said. \"Pack up and go, I want you out by\r\nmorning. You're done here. You don't represent the ride and you never\r\nwill. Get lost.\" He didn't know he was going to say it until he said\r\nit, but it felt right. This was what he was feeling -- *his* project\r\nhad been stolen and bad things were being done in *his* name and it\r\nwas going to stop, right now.\r\n\r\nTjan and Kettlewell got to their feet and looked at him, faces blank\r\nwith shock. Kettlewell recovered first. \"Perry, let's sit down and do\r\nan exit interview, all right? That's traditional.\"\r\n\r\nPerry was shaking with anger now. These two friends of his, they'd\r\nfucking screwed him -- committed their dirty work in his name. But\r\nKettlewell was holding a chair out to him and the others in the\r\ntea-house were staring and he thought about Eva and the kids and the\r\nbaseball gloves, and he sat down.\r\n\r\nHe squeezed his thighs hard with his clenching hands, drew in a deep\r\nbreath, and recited what Death Waits had told him in an even, wooden\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"So that's it. I don't know if you instructed the lawyers to do this\r\nor only just distanced yourself enough from them to let them do this\r\non their own. The point is that the way you're running this campaign\r\nis victimizing people who believe in us, making life worse for people\r\nwho already got a shitty, shitty deal on our account. I won't have\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell and Tjan looked at each other. They'd both stayed\r\npoker-faced through Perry's accusation, and now Kettlewell made a\r\nlittle go-ahead gesture at Tjan.\r\n\r\n\"There's no excuse for what that lawyer did. We didn't authorize it,\r\nwe didn't know it had happened, and we wouldn't have permitted it if\r\nwe had. In a suit like this, there are a lot of moving parts and\r\nthere's no way to keep track of all of them all of the time. You don't\r\nknow what every ride operator in the world is up to, you don't even\r\nknow where all the rides in the world *are*. That's in the nature of a\r\ndecentralized business.\r\n\r\n\"But here's the thing: the lawyer was at least partly\r\nright. Everything that kid blogs, emails, and says will potentially\r\nend up in the public record. Like it or not, that kid can no longer\r\nconsider himself to have a private life, not until the court case is\r\nup. Neither can you or I, for that matter. That's in the nature of a\r\nlawsuit -- and it's not something any of us can change at this point.\"\r\n\r\nPerry heard him as from a great distance, through the whooshing of the\r\nblood in his ears. He couldn't think of anything to say to that.\r\n\r\nTjan and Kettlewell looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\"So even if we're 'fired' --\" Tjan said at last, making sarcastic\r\nfinger-quotes, \"this problem won't go away. We've floated the\r\nsyndicate and given control of the legal case to them. If you try to\r\nditch it, you're going to have to contend with *their* lawsuits, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't --\" Perry started. But he had, he'd signed all kinds of\r\npapers: first, papers that incorporated the ride-runners' co-op; and,\r\nsecond, papers that gave legal representation over to the syndicate.\r\n\r\n\"Perry, I'm the chairman of the Boston ride collective. I'm their rep\r\non the co-op's board. You can't fire me. You didn't hire me. They\r\ndid. So stop breathing through your nose like a locomotive and calm\r\ndown. None of us wanted that lawyer to go after that kid.\"\r\n\r\nHe knew they were making sense but he didn't want to care. He'd ended\r\nup in this place because these supposed pals of his had screwed up.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he was going to end up making up with them, going to end\r\nup getting deeper into this. He knew that this was how good people did\r\nshitty things: one tiny rotten compromise at a time. Well, he wasn't\r\ngoing to go there.\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow morning,\" he said. \"Gone. We can figure out by email how to\r\nhave a smooth transition, but no more of this. Not on my head. Not on\r\nmy account.\"\r\n\r\nHe stalked away, which is what he should have done in the first\r\nplace. Fuck being reasonable. Reasonable sucked.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDeath found out about the Disney-in-a-Box printers seconds after they\r\nwere announced. He'd been tuning his feed-watchers to give him news\r\nabout the Disney Parks for nearly a decade, and this little PR item on\r\nthe Disney Parks newswire rang all the cherries on his filters,\r\nflagging the item red and rocketing it to the top of his news\r\nplaylist, making all the icons in the sides of his screen bounce with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nThe announcement made him want to throw up. They were totally ripping\r\noff the rides, and he knew for a fact that most of the three-d meshes\r\nof the old yesterland rides and even the contemporary ones were\r\nfan-made, so those'd be ripped off, too.\r\n\r\nAnd the worst part was, he could feel himself getting excited. This\r\nwas just the kind of thing that would have given him major fanboy\r\ndrool as recently as a month ago.\r\n\r\nHe just stared angrily at his screen. Being angry made the painkillers\r\nwear off, so the madder he got the more he hurt. He could nail the\r\nrocker-switch and dose himself with more of whatever the painkiller\r\nplugged into his IV was today, but since Perry and Lester and their\r\ngirlfriends (had that other one been Suzanne Church? It sure looked\r\nlike her) had told him he could use his laptop again, he'd stayed off\r\nthe juice as much as possible. The computer could make him forget he\r\nhurt.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the clock. It was 4AM. The blinds on the ward were shut\r\nmost of the time, and he kept to his own schedule, napping and then\r\nsurfing, then nodding off and then surfing some more. The hospital\r\nstaff just left his food on the table beside him if he was asleep when\r\nit arrived, though they woke him for his sponge baths and to stick\r\nfresh needles in his arms, which were filled with bruisey collapsed\r\nveins.\r\n\r\nThere was no one he could tell about this. Sure, there were chat-rooms\r\nwith 24/7 chatter from Disney freaks, but he didn't much want to chat\r\nwith them. Some of his friends would still be up and tweaking, but\r\nChrist, who wanted to IM with a speed freak at four in the morning?\r\nHis typing was down to less than 30 wpm, and he couldn't keep it up\r\nfor long. What he really wanted was to talk to someone about this.\r\n\r\nHe really wanted to talk to Perry about this. He should send him an\r\nemail, but he had the inkling of an idea and he didn't want to put it\r\nin writing, because it was a deliciously naughty idea.\r\n\r\nIt was dumb to even think about phoning him, he barely knew him, and\r\nno one liked to get calls at four am. Besides -- he'd checked --\r\nPerry's number was unlisted.\r\n\r\nFrom: deathw@deathwait.er To: pgibbons@hollywood.ride Subject: What's\r\nyour phone number?\r\n\r\nPerry, I know that it's presumptuous, but I'd really like to talk to\r\nyou v2v about something important that I'd prefer not to put in\r\nwriting. I don't have any right to impose on you, especially not after\r\nyou've already done me the kindness of coming to see me in the\r\nhospital, but I hope you'll send me your number anyway. Alternatively,\r\nplease call me on my enum -- 1800DEATHWAITS-GGFSAH.\r\n\r\nYour admirer,\r\n\r\nDeath Waits\r\n\r\nIt was five minutes later when his laptop rang. It was unnaturally\r\nloud on the ward, and he heard his roommates stir when the tone\r\nplayed. He didn't have a headset -- Christ, he was an idiot. Wait,\r\nthere was one, dangling from the TV. No mic, but at least he could\r\npair it with his laptop for sound. He stabbed at the mute button and\r\nreached for the headset and slipped it on. Then he held the computer\r\nclose to his face and whispered \"Hello?\" into its little mic. His\r\nvoice was a croak, his ruined mouth distorting the word. Why had he\r\ndecided to call this guy? He was such an idiot.\r\n\r\n\"This is Perry Gibbons. Is that Death Waits?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sorry, I don't have a mic. Can you hear me OK?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I turn the volume all the way up I can.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an awkward silence. Death tried to think of how to begin.\r\n\r\n\"What's on your mind, Death?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't expect you to be awake at this hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a rough night,\" Perry said. It occurred to Death that he was\r\ntalking to one of his heros, a man who had come to visit him in the\r\nhospital that day. He grew even more tongue-tied.\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing important,\" Perry said and swallowed, and Death suddenly\r\nunderstood that Perry had had a rough night because of *him*, because\r\nof what *he'd* told Perry. It made him want to cry.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Death said.\r\n\r\n\"What's on your mind, Death?\" Perry said again.\r\n\r\nDeath told him what he'd found, about the Disney printers. He read\r\nPerry the URLs so he could look them up.\r\n\r\n\"OK, that's interesting,\" Perry said. Death could tell he didn't\r\nreally think it was that interesting.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't told you my idea yet.\" He groped for the words. His mouth\r\nhad gone dry. \"OK, so Disney's going to ship these things to tons of\r\npeople's houses, they'll sell them cheap at the parks and mail them as\r\nfreebies to Magic Kingdom Club gold-card holders. So in a week or two,\r\nthere's going to be just, you know, tons of these across the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right.\"\r\n\r\n\"So here's my idea: what if you could get them to build non-Disney\r\nstuff? What if you could send them plans for stuff from the rides?\r\nWhat if you could just download your friends' designs? What if this\r\nwas opened wide.\"\r\n\r\nPerry chuckled on the other end of the line, then laughed,\r\nfull-throated and full of merriment. \"I like the way you think, kid,\"\r\nhe said, once he'd caught his breath.\r\n\r\nAnd then this amazing thing happened. Perry Gibbons *brainstormed*\r\nwith him about the kinds of designs they could push out to these\r\nthings. It was like some kind of awesome dream come true. Perry was\r\ntreating him like a peer, loving his ideas, keying off of them.\r\n\r\nThen a dismal thought struck him. \"Wait though, wait. They're using\r\ntheir own goop for the printers. Every design we print makes them\r\nricher.\"\r\n\r\nPerry laughed again, really merry. \"Oh, that kind of thing never\r\nworks. They've been trying to tie feedstock to printers since the\r\ninkjet days. We go through that like wet kleenex.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that illegal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who the fuck knows? It shouldn't be. I don't care about illegal\r\nanymore. Legal gets you lawyers. Come on, dude -- what's the point of\r\nbeing all into some anti-authoritarian subculture if you spend all\r\nyour time sucking up to the authorities?\"\r\n\r\nDeath laughed, which actually hurt quite a bit. It was the first laugh\r\nhe'd had since he'd ended up in the hospital, maybe the first one\r\nsince he'd been fired from Disney World, and as much as it hurt, it\r\nfelt good, too, like a band being loosened from around his broken\r\nribs.\r\n\r\nHis roommates stirred and one of them must have pushed the nurse call\r\nbutton, because shortly thereafter, the formidable Ukrainian nurse\r\ncame in and savagely told him off for disturbing the ward at five in\r\nthe morning. Perry heard and said his goodbyes, like they were old\r\npals who'd chatted too long, and Death Waits rang off and fell into a\r\nlight doze, grinning like a maniac.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nHilda eyed Perry curiously. \"That sounded like an interesting\r\nconversation,\" she said. She was wearing a long t-shirt of his that\r\ndidn't really cover much, and she looked delicious in it. It was all\r\nhe could do to keep from grabbing her and tossing her on the bed -- of\r\ncourse, the cast meant that he couldn't really do that. And Hilda\r\nwasn't exactly smiling, either.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you up,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't the talking that did it, it was you not being there in the\r\nfirst place. Gave me the toss-and-turns.\"\r\n\r\nShe came over to him then, the lean muscles in her legs flexing as she\r\ncrossed the living room. She took his laptop away and set it down on\r\nthe coffee-table, then took off his headset. He was wearing nothing\r\nbut boxers, and she reached down and gave his dick a companionable\r\nhonk before sitting down next to him and giving him a kiss on the\r\ncheek, the throat and the lips.\r\n\r\n\"So, Perry,\" she said, looking into his eyes. \"What the fuck are you\r\ndoing sitting in the living room at 5 am talking to your computer? And\r\nwhy didn't you come to bed last night? I'm not going to be hanging out\r\nin Florida for the rest of my life. I woulda thought you'd want to\r\nmaximize your Hilda-time while you've got the chance.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled to let him know she was kidding around, but she was right,\r\nof course.\r\n\r\n\"I'm an idiot, Hilda. I fired Tjan and Kettlewell, told them to get\r\nlost.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why you think that's such a bad idea. You need\r\nbusiness-people, probably, but it doesn't need to be those\r\nguys. Sometimes you can have too much history with someone to work\r\nwith him. Besides, anything can be un-said. You can change your mind\r\nin a week or a month. Those guys aren't doing anything special. They'd\r\ncome back to you if you asked 'em. You're Perry motherfuckin'\r\nGibbons. You rule, dude.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a very nice person, Hilda Hammersen. But those guys are\r\nrunning our legal defense, which we're going to need, because I'm\r\nabout to do something semi-illegal that's bound to get us sued again\r\nby the same pack of assholes as last time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Disney?\" She snorted. \"Have you ever read up on the history of the\r\nDisney Company? The old one, the one Walt founded? Walt Disney wasn't\r\njust a racist creep, he was also a mad inventor. He kept coming up\r\nwith these cool high-tech ways of making cartoons -- sticking real\r\npeople in them, putting them in color, adding sync-sound. People loved\r\nit all, but it drove him out of business. It was all too expensive.\r\n\r\n\"So he recruited his brother, Roy Disney, who was just a banker, to\r\nrun the business. Roy turned the business around, watching the income\r\nand the outgo. But all this came at a price: Roy wanted to tell Walt\r\nhow to run the business. More to the point, he wanted to tell Walt\r\nthat he couldn't just spend millions from the company coffers on\r\nweird-ass R&D projects, especially not when the company was still\r\nfiguring out how to exploit the *last* R&D project Walt had\r\nchased. But it was Walt's company, and he'd overrule Roy, and Roy\r\nwould promise that it was going to put them in the poorhouse and then\r\nhe'd figure out how to make another million off of Walt's vision,\r\nbecause that's what the money guy is supposed to do.\r\n\r\n\"Then after the war, Walt went to Roy and said, 'Give me $17 million,\r\nI'm going to build a theme-park. And Roy said, 'You can't have it and\r\nwhat's a theme-park?' Walt threatened to fire Roy, the way he always\r\nhad, and Roy pointed out that Disney was now a *public* company with\r\nshareholders who weren't going to let Walt cowboy around and piss away\r\ntheir money on his toys.\"\r\n\r\n\"So how'd he get Disneyland built?\"\r\n\r\n\"He quit. He started his own company, WED, for Walter Elias Disney. He\r\npoached all the geniuses away from the studios and turned them into\r\nhis 'Imagineers' and cashed in his life-insurance policy and raised\r\nhis own dough and built the park, and then made Roy buy the company\r\nback from him. I'm guessing that that felt pretty good.\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounds like it must've,\" Perry said. He was feeling thoughtful,\r\nand buzzed from the sleepless night, and jazzed from his conversation\r\nwith Death Waits. He had an idea that they could push designs out to\r\nthe printers that were like the Disney designs, but weird and kinky\r\nand subversive and a little disturbing.\r\n\r\n\"I can understand why you'd be nervous about ditching your suits, but\r\nthey're just that, suits. At some level, they're all interchangeable,\r\nmercenary parts. You want someone to watch the bottom line, but not\r\nsomeone who'll run the show. If that's not these guys, hey, that's\r\ncool. Find a couple more suits and run them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus, you really *are* Yoko, aren't you?\" Lester was wearing his\r\nboxers and a bleary grin, standing in the living room's doorway where\r\nHilda had stood a minute before. It was past 6AM now, and there were\r\nwaking up sounds through the whole condo, toilets flushing, a car\r\nstarting down in the parking lot.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Lester,\" Hilda said. She smiled when she said it, no\r\noffense taken, all good, all good.\r\n\r\n\"You fired who now, Perry?\" Lester dug a pint of chocolate ice-cream\r\nout of the freezer and attacked it with a self-heating ceramic spoon\r\nthat he'd designed specifically for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\"I got rid of Kettlewell and Tjan,\" Perry said. He was blushing. \"I\r\nwould have talked to you about it, but you were with Suzanne. I had to\r\ndo it, though. I had to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate what happened to Death Waits. I hate that we've got some of\r\nthe blame for it. But, Perry, Tjan and Kettlewell are part of our\r\noutfit. It's their show, too. You can't just go shit-canning them. Not\r\njust morally, either. Legally. Those guys own a piece of this thing\r\nand they're keeping the lawyers at bay too. They're managing all the\r\nevil shit so we don't have to. I don't want to be in charge of the\r\nevil, and neither do you, and hiring a new suit isn't going to be\r\neasy. They're all predatory, they all have delusions of grandeur.\"\r\n\r\n\"You two have the acumen to hire better representation than those\r\ntwo,\" Hilda said. \"You're experienced now, and you've founded a\r\nmovement that plenty of people would kill to be a part of. You just\r\nneed better management structure: an executive you can overrule\r\nwhenever you need to. A lackey, not a boss.\"\r\n\r\nLester acted as though he hadn't heard her. \"I'm being pretty mellow\r\nabout this, buddy. I'm not making a big deal out of the fact that you\r\ndid this without consulting me, because I know how rough it must have\r\nbeen to discover that this wickedness had gone down in our name, and I\r\nmight have done the same. But it's the cold light of day now and it's\r\ntime to go over there together and have a chat with Tjan and\r\nKettlewell and talk this over and sort it out. We can't afford to burn\r\nall this to the ground and start over now.\"\r\n\r\nPerry knew it was reasonable, but screw reasonable. Reasonable was how\r\ngood people ended up doing wrong. Sometimes you had to be\r\nunreasonable.\r\n\r\n\"Lester, they violated our trust. It was their responsibility to do\r\nthis thing and do it right. They didn't do that. They didn't look\r\nclosely at this thing so that they wouldn't have to put the brakes on\r\nif it turned out to be dirty. Which do you think those two would\r\nrather have happen: we run a cool project that everyone loves, or we\r\nrun a lawsuit that makes ten billion dollars for their investors?\r\nThey're playing a different game from us and their victory condition\r\nisn't ours. I don't want to be reasonable. I want to do the right\r\nthing. You and me could have sold out a thousand times over the years\r\nand made money instead of doing good, but we didn't. We didn't because\r\nit's better to be right than to be reasonable and rich. You say we\r\ncan't afford to get rid of those two. I say we can't afford not to.\"\r\n\r\n\"You need to get a good night's sleep, buddy,\" Lester said. He was\r\nblowing through his nose, a sure sign that he was angry. It made\r\nPerry's hackles go up -- he and Lester didn't fight much but when they\r\ndid, hoo-boy. \"You need to mellow out and see that what you're talking\r\nabout is abandoning our friends, Kettlewell and Tjan, to make our own\r\negos feel a little better. You need to see that we're risking\r\neverything, risking spending our lives in court and losing everything\r\nwe've ever built.\"\r\n\r\nA Zen-like calm descended on Perry. Hilda was right. Suits were\r\neverywhere, and you could choose your own. You didn't need to let the\r\nRoy Disneys of the world call the shots.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry you feel that way, Lester. I hear everything you're saying,\r\nbut you know what, it's going to be my way. I understand that what I\r\nwant to do is risky, but there's no way I can go on doing what I'm\r\ndoing and letting things get worse and worse. Making a little\r\ncompromise here and there is how you end up selling out everything\r\nthat's important. We're going to find other business-managers and\r\nwe're going to work with them to make a smooth transition. Maybe we'll\r\nall come out of this friends later on. They want to do something\r\ndifferent from what I want to do is all.\"\r\n\r\nThis wasn't calming Lester down at all. \"Perry, this isn't your\r\nproject to do what you want with. This belongs to a lot of us. I did\r\nmost of the work in there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did, buddy. I get that. If you want to stick with them, that's\r\nhow it'll go. No hard feelings. I'll go off and do my own thing, run\r\nmy own ride. People who want to connect to my network, no sweat, they\r\ncan do it. That's cool. We'll still be friends. You can work with\r\nKettlewell and Tjan.\" Perry could hardly believe these words were\r\ncoming out of his mouth. They'd been buddies forever, inseparable.\r\n\r\nHilda took his hand silently.\r\n\r\nLester looked at him with increasing incredulity. \"You don't mean\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lester, if we split, it would break my heart. There wouldn't be a day\r\nthat went by from now to the end of time that I didn't regret it. But\r\nif we keep going down this path, it's going to cost me my soul. I'd\r\nrather be broke than evil.\" Oh, it felt so *good* to be saying\r\nthis. To finally affirm through deed and word that he was a good\r\nperson who would put ethics before greed, before comfort even.\r\n\r\nLester looked at Hilda for a moment. \"Hilda, this is probably\r\nsomething that Perry and I should talk about alone, if you don't\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\n\"*I* mind, Lester. There's nothing you can't say in front of her.\"\r\n\r\nLester apparently had nothing to say to that, and the silence made\r\nPerry uncomfortable. Lester had tears in his eyes, and that hit Perry\r\nin the chest like a spear. His friend didn't cry often.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the room and hugged Lester. Lester was wooden and\r\nunyielding.\r\n\r\n\"Please, Lester. Please. I hate to make you choose, but you have to\r\nchoose. We're on the same side. We've always been on the same\r\nside. Neither of us are the kind of people who send lawyers after kids\r\nin hospital. Never. I want to make it good again. We can have the kind\r\nof gig where we do the right thing and the cool thing. Come on,\r\nLester. Please.\"\r\n\r\nHe let go of Lester. Lester turned on his heel and walked back into\r\nhis bedroom. Perry knew that that meant he'd won. He smiled at Hilda\r\nand hugged her. She was a lot more fun to hug than Lester.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSammy was at his desk looking over the production prototype for the\r\nDisney-in-a-Box (R) units that Imagineering had dropped off that\r\nmorning when his phone rang. Not his desk phone -- his cellular phone,\r\nwith the call-return number blocked.\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\" he said. Not many people had this number -- he didn't like\r\ngetting interrupted by the phone. People who needed to talk to him\r\ncould talk to his secretary first.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Sammy. Have I caught you at a bad time?\" He could hear the sneer\r\nin the voice and then he could see the face that went with the sneer:\r\nFreddy. Shit. He'd given the reporter his number back when they were\r\narranging their disastrous face-to-face.\r\n\r\n\"It's not a good time, Freddy,\" he said. \"If you call my secretary --\"\r\n\r\n\"I just need a moment of your time, sir. For a quote. For a story\r\nabout the ride response to your printers -- your Disney-in-a-Box\r\nCircle-R, Tee-Em, Circle-C.\"\r\n\r\nSammy felt his guts tense up. Of course those ride assholes would have\r\nknown about the printers. That's what press-releases were\r\nfor. Somewhere on their message-boards he was sure that there was some\r\ndiscussion of them. He hadn't had time to look for it, though, and he\r\ndidn't want to use the Disney Parks competitive intel people on this\r\nstuff, because after the Death Waits debacle (debacle on debacle, ack,\r\nhe could be such a fuck-up) he didn't want to have any train of\r\nintel-gathering on the group pointing back to him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not familiar with any response,\" Sammy said. \"I'm afraid I can't\r\ncomment --\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it'll only take a moment to explain it,\" Freddy said and then\r\nlaunched into a high-speed explanation before Sammy could object. They\r\nwere delivering their own three-d models for the printers, and had\r\neven gotten hold of one of the test units Disney had passed out last\r\nweek. They claimed to have reverse-engineered the goop that it ran on,\r\nso that anyone's goop could print to it.\r\n\r\n\"So, what I'm looking for is a quote from Disney on this. Do you\r\ncondone this? Did you anticipate it? What if someone prints an AK-47\r\nwith it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one's going to print a working AK-47 with this,\" Sammy said. \"It's\r\ntoo brittle. AK-47 manufacturing is already sadly in great profusion\r\nacross our inner cities, anyway. As to the rest of it --\" He closed\r\nhis eyes and took a couple of deep breaths. \"As to the rest of it,\r\nthat would be something you'd have to speak to one of my legal\r\ncolleagues about. Would you like me to put you through to them?\"\r\n\r\nFreddy laughed. \"Oh come on, Sammy. A little something on background,\r\nno attribution? You going to sue them? Have them beaten up?\"\r\n\r\nSammy felt his face go white. \"I'm sure I don't know what you're\r\ntalking about --\"\r\n\r\n\"Word has it that the Death Waits kid came up with this. He used to be\r\nyour protege, no? And I hear that Kettlewell and Tjan have been kicked\r\nout of the organization -- no one around to call the lawyers out on\r\ntheir behalf. Seems like a golden opportunity to strike.\"\r\n\r\nSammy seethed. He'd been concentrating on making new stuff, great\r\nstuff. Competitive stuff, to be sure, but in the end, the reason for\r\nmaking the Disney-in-a-Box devices had been to make them, make them as\r\ncool as he could imagine. To plus them and re-plus them, in the old\r\nslang of Walt Disney, making the thing because the thing could be made\r\nand the world would be a more fun place once it was.\r\n\r\nNow here was this troll egging him on to go to war again with those\r\nride shit-heads, to spend his energies destroying instead of\r\ncreating. The worst part? It was all his fault. He'd brought his own\r\ndestruction: the reporter, Death Waits, even the lawsuit. All the\r\nresult of his bad planning and dumb decisions. God, he was a total\r\nfuck-up.\r\n\r\nDisney-in-a-Box sat on his desk, humming faintly -- not humming like a\r\nfridge hums, but actually humming in a baritone hum, humming a medley\r\nof magic-users' songs from Disney movies, like a living thing. Every\r\nonce in a while it would clear its throat and mutter and even snore a\r\nlittle. There would be happy rustles and whispered conversations from\r\nwithin the guts of the thing. It was plussed all the way to hell and\r\nback. It had been easy, as more and more Imagineers had come up with\r\ncool features to add to the firmware, contributing them to the\r\nversioning system, and he'd been able to choose from among them and\r\npick the best of the lot, making a device that rivaled Walt's 1955\r\nDisneyland itself for originality, excitement, and cool.\r\n\r\n\"I'll just say you declined to comment, then?\"\r\n\r\nAsshole.\r\n\r\n\"You write whatever you need to write, Freddy,\" he said. A hatch\r\nopened a tiny bit on the top of the cube and a pair of eyes peered\r\nout, then it slammed shut and there was a round of convincing giggles\r\nand scurrying from within the box. This could be huge, if Sammy didn't\r\nfuck it up by worrying too much about what someone else was up to.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, and one other thing: it looks like the Death Waits kid is going\r\nto be discharged from the hospital this week.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nHe wasn't ready to leave the hospital. For starters, he couldn't walk\r\nyet, and there were still times when he could barely remember where he\r\nwas, and there was the problem of the catheter. But the insurance\r\ncompany and the hospital had concurred that he'd had all the treatment\r\nhe needed -- even if his doctor hadn't been able to look him in the\r\neye when this was explained -- and it was time for him to go home. Go\r\naway. Go anywhere.\r\n\r\nHe'd put it all in his LJ, the conversation as best as he could\r\nremember it, the way it made him feel. The conversation he'd had with\r\nPerry and the idea he'd had for pwning Disney-in-a-Box. He didn't even\r\nknow if his apartment was still there -- he hadn't been back in weeks\r\nand the rent was overdue.\r\n\r\nAnd the comments came flooding in. First a couple dozen from his\r\nfriends, then hundreds, then thousands. Raging fights -- some people\r\naccused him of being a fakester sock-puppet aimed at gathering\r\nsympathy or donations (!) -- side-conversations, philosophical\r\narguments.\r\n\r\nBuried in there, offers from real world and online friends to meet him\r\nat the hospital, to get him home, to take care of him. It was\r\nunbelievable. There was a small fortune -- half-a-year's wages at his\r\nold job -- waiting in his paypal, and if this was all to be believed,\r\nthere was a cadre of people waiting just outside that door to meet\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe nurse who came to get him looked rattled. \"Your friends are here,\"\r\nshe said in her Boris-and-Natasha accent, and gave him a disapproving\r\nlook as she disconnected his hoses and pipes so swiftly he didn't have\r\ntime to register the pain he felt. She pulled on a pair of Salvation\r\nArmy underpants -- the first pair he'd worn in weeks -- and a pair of\r\nnew, dark blue-jeans and a Rotary picnic t-shirt dated three years\r\nbefore. The shirt was a small and it still hung from him like a tent.\r\n\r\n\"You will use canes?\" she asked. He'd had some physiotherapy that week\r\nand he could take one or two doddering steps on crutches, but canes?\r\nNo way.\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" he said, picturing himself sprawled on the polished\r\nconcrete floor, with what was left of his face bashed in from the\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n\"Wheelchair,\" she said to someone in the hall, and an orderly came in\r\npushing a chair with a squeaky wheel -- though the chair itself was a\r\npretty good one, at least as good as the ones they rented at Disney,\r\nwhich were nearly indestructible. He let the nurse transfer him to it\r\nwith her strong hands in his armpits and under his knees. A bag\r\ncontaining his laptop and a few cards and things that had shown up at\r\nthe hospital was dumped into his lap and he clutched it to himself as\r\nhe was wheeled to the end of the corridor and around the corner, where\r\nthe nurse's station, the elevators, the common area and his *fans*\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nThey weren't just his pals, though there were a few of them there, but\r\nalso a big crowd of people he'd never met, didn't recognize. There\r\nwere goths, skinny and pale and draped in black, but they were\r\noutnumbered by the subculture civilians, normal-looking, slightly\r\nhippieish, old and young. When he hove into sight, they burst into a\r\nwild cheer. The orderly stopped pushing his chair and the nurse rushed\r\nforward to shush them sternly, but it barely dampened the calls. There\r\nwere wolf whistles, cheers, calls, disorganized chants, and then two\r\nvery pretty girls -- he hadn't thought about \"pretty\" anything in a\r\nlong, long time -- unfurled a banner that said DEATH WAITS in glittery\r\nhand-drawn letters, with a little skull dotting the I in WAITS.\r\n\r\nThe nurse read the banner and reached to tear it out of their hands,\r\nbut they folded it back. She came to him and hissed in his ear,\r\nsomething about getting security to get rid of these people if they\r\nwere bothering him, and he realized that she thought DEATH WAITS was a\r\n*threat* and that made him laugh so hard he choked, and she flounced\r\noff in a deeply Slavic huff.\r\n\r\nAnd then he was among his welcoming party, and it *was* a party --\r\nthere were cake and clove cigarettes in smoke-savers and cans of\r\nlicorice coffee, and everyone wanted to talk with him and take their\r\npictures with him, and the two pretty girls took turns making up his\r\nface, highlighting his scars to make him fit for a Bela Lugosi\r\nrole. The were called Lacey and Tracey, and they were sisters who went\r\nto the ride every day, they said breathlessly, and they'd seen the\r\nstory he'd described, seen it with their own eyes, and it was\r\nsomething that was as personal as the twin language they'd developed\r\nto communicate with one another when they were little girls.\r\n\r\nHis old friends surrounded him: guys who marveled at his recovery,\r\ngirls who kissed his cheek and messed up Tracey and Lacey's\r\nmakeup. Some of them had new tattoos to show him -- one girl had\r\ngotten a full-leg piece showing scenes from the ride, and she slyly\r\npulled her skirt all the way up, all the way up, to show him where it\r\nall started.\r\n\r\nSecurity showed up and threw them all out into the street, where the\r\nheat was oppressive and wet, but the air was fresh and full of smells\r\nthat weren't sickness or medicine, which made Death Waits feel like he\r\ncould get up and dance. Effervescent citrus and biodiesel fumes, moist\r\nvegetation and the hum of lazy high noon bugs.\r\n\r\n\"Now, it's all arranged,\" one of the straight-looking ones told\r\nhim. He'd figured out that these were the pure story people, who'd\r\nread his descriptions and concluded that he'd seen something more than\r\nanyone else. They all wanted a chance to talk to him, but didn't seem\r\ntoo put out that he was spending most of his time with his old\r\nmates. \"Don't worry about a thing.\" Car after car appeared, taking\r\naway more of the party. \"Here you go.\"\r\n\r\nAnother car pulled up, an all-electric kneeling number with a huge\r\ncargo space. They wheeled the chair right into it, and then two of the\r\nstory-hippies helped him transfer into the seat. \"My mom was in a\r\nwheelchair for ten years before she passed,\" a hippie told him. He was\r\nolder and looked like an English teacher Death Waits had quite liked\r\nin grade ten. He strapped Death Waits in like a pro and off they went.\r\n\r\nThey were ten minutes into Melbourne traffic -- Death marveling at\r\nbuildings, signs, people, in every color, without the oppressive\r\nwhite-and-gore colors of everything in the hospital -- when the\r\nEnglish teacher dude looked shyly at Death.\r\n\r\n\"You think it's real -- the Story, I mean -- don't you?\"\r\n\r\nDeath thought about this for a second. He'd been very focused on the\r\nPark-in-a-Box printers for the past week, which felt like an eternity\r\nto him, but he remembered his obsession with the story fondly. It\r\nrequired a kind of floaty non-concentration to really see it, a\r\nmeditative state he'd found easy to attain with all the painkillers.\r\n\r\n\"It's real,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe English teacher and two of his friends seemed to relax a\r\nlittle. \"We think so too.\"\r\n\r\nThey pulled up to his condo -- how'd they know where he lived? -- and\r\nparked right next to his car! He could see where the tow had kind of\r\nfucked-up the rear bumper, but other than that, it was just as he\r\nremembered it, and it looked like someone had given it a wash,\r\ntoo. The English teacher put his car in park and came around to open\r\nhis door just as the rest of the welcoming party came out of his\r\nbuilding, pushing --\r\n\r\nA stair-climbing wheelchair, the same kind that they used in the\r\nride. Death laughed aloud with delight when he saw it rolling toward\r\nhim, handling the curb easily, hardly a bump, and the two pretty\r\ngirls, Tracey and Lacey, transferred him into it, and both contrived\r\nto brush their breasts and jasmine-scented hair across his cheeks as\r\nthey did so, and he felt the first stirrings in his ruined groin that\r\nhe'd felt since before his beating.\r\n\r\nHe laughed like a wild-man, and they all laughed with him and someone\r\nput a clove cigarette between his lips and he drew on it, coughed a\r\nlittle, and then had another drag before he rolled into the elevator.\r\n\r\nThe girls put him to bed hours later. His apartment had been spotless\r\nand he had every confidence that it would be spotless again come\r\nnight-time. The party had spent the rest of the day and most of the\r\nnight talking about the story that they'd seen in the ride, where\r\nthey'd seen it, what it meant. There was a lot of debate about whether\r\nthey had any business rating things now that the story had shown\r\nitself to them. The story was the product of unconscious effort, and\r\nit should be left to unconscious effort.\r\n\r\nBut the counter-argument was that they had a duty to garden the story,\r\nor possibly to sharpen its telling, or to protect it from people who\r\ncouldn't see it or wouldn't see it.\r\n\r\nAt first Death didn't know what to make of all this talk. At first he\r\nfound it funny and more than a little weird to be taking the story\r\nthis seriously. It was beautiful, but it was an accidental beauty. The\r\nride was the important thing, the story was its effect.\r\n\r\nBut these people convinced him that they were right, that the story\r\n*had* to be important. After all, it had inspired all of them, hadn't\r\nit? The ride was just technology -- the story was what the ride was\r\n*for*.\r\n\r\nHis head swam with it.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to protect it,\" he said finally, after listening to the\r\nargument, after eating the food with which they'd filled his fridge,\r\nafter talking intensely with Tracey (or possibly Lacey) about their\r\nparents' unthinking blandness, after letting the English teacher guy\r\n(whose name was Jim) take him to the toilet, after letting his old\r\ngoth pals play some music some mutual friends had just mixed.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to protect it and sharpen it. The story wants to get out\r\nand there will be those who can't see it.\" He didn't care that his\r\nspeech was mangled by his fucked-up face. He'd seen his face in the\r\nmirror and Tracey and Lacey had done a nice job in making it up -- he\r\nlooked like a latter-day Marilyn Manson, his twisted mouth a ghoulish\r\nsmear. The doctors had talked about giving him another series of\r\nsurgeries to fix his lip, a set of implanted dentures to replace the\r\nmissing teeth, had even mentioned that there were specialist clinics\r\nwhere he could get a new set budded and grown right out of his own\r\ngums. That had been back when the mysterious forces of the lawsuit and\r\nthe ride were paying his bills.\r\n\r\nNow he contemplated his face in the mirror and told himself he'd get\r\nused to this, he'd come to like it, it would be a trademark. It would\r\nmake him gothier than goth, for life, always an outsider, always one\r\nof the weird ones, like the old-timers who'd come to Disney with their\r\nteenaged, eye-rolling kids. Goths' kids were never goths, it seemed --\r\nmore like bang-bangers or jocky-looking peak-performance types, or\r\nhippies or gippies or dippies or tippies or whatever. But their\r\nparents were still proudly flying their freak-flags, weird to the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n\"We'll let everyone know about it,\" he said, thinking not of\r\n*everyone* but of all the cool subculture kids he'd grown up with and\r\nworshipped and been rejected by and dated and loved and hated -- \"and\r\nwe'll make it part of *everyone*'s story. We'll protect it, guys. Of\r\ncourse we'll protect it.\"\r\n\r\nThat settled the argument. Death hadn't expected that. Since when did\r\nhe get the last word on any subject? Since now. They were following\r\nhis lead.\r\n\r\nAnd then the girls put him to bed, shyly helping him undress, each of\r\nthem leaning over him to kiss him good night. Tracey's kiss was\r\nsisterly, on the cheek, her spicy perfume and her jet-black hair\r\ncaressing him. Lacey's kiss was anything but sisterly. She mashed her\r\nbreasts to his chest and thrust her tongue into his mouth, keeping her\r\nsilver eyes open and staring deep into his, her fingers working busily\r\nin his hair.\r\n\r\nShe broke the kiss off with a gasp and a giggle. She traced the ruin\r\nof his mouth with a fingertip, breathing heavily, and let it slide\r\nlower, down his chest. He found himself actually *hard*, the first\r\npleasurable sensation he'd had in his dick since that fateful\r\nnight. From the corridor came an impatient cough -- Tracey, waiting\r\nfor Lacey to get going.\r\n\r\nLacey rolled her eyes and giggled again and then slid her hand the\r\nrest of the way down, briefly holding his dick and then encircling his\r\nballs with her fingers before kissing him again on the twist of his\r\nlips and backing out of the room, whispering, \"Sleep well, see you in\r\nthe morning.\"\r\n\r\nDeath lay awake and staring at the ceiling for a long time after they\r\nhad gone. The English teacher dude had left him with a bedpan for the\r\nnight and many of them had promised to return in rotations\r\nindefinitely during the days, helping him out with dressing and\r\nshopping and getting him in and out of his marvelous chair.\r\n\r\nHe stared and stared at that ceiling, and then he reached for his\r\nlaptop, there beside the bed, the same place it had lived when he was\r\nin the hospital. He fired it up and went straight to today's\r\nfly-throughs of the ride and ran through them from different angles --\r\nfacing backward and sideways, looking down and looking up, noting all\r\nthe elements that felt like *story* and all the ones that didn't,\r\nwishing he had his plus-one/minus-one joystick with him to carve out\r\nthe story he was seeing.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nLester wouldn't work the ride anymore, so Perry took it on his\r\nown. Hilda was in town buying groceries -- his chest-freezer of\r\ngourmet surplus food had blown its compressor and the contents had\r\nspoiled in a mess of venison and sour blueberry sauce and duck\r\npancakes -- and he stood alone. Normally he loved this, being the\r\ncarnival barker at the middle of the three-ring circus of fans,\r\ntourists and hawkers, but today his cast itched, he hadn't slept\r\nenough, and there were lawyers chasing him. Lots of lawyers.\r\n\r\nA caravan of cars pulled into the lot like a Tim Burton version of a\r\nfuneral, a long train of funnycar hearses with jacked-up rear wheels\r\nand leaning chimney-pots, gargoyles and black bunting with\r\nsuper-bright black-light LEDs giving them a commercially eldritch\r\nglow. Mixed in were some straight cars, and they came and came and\r\ncame, car on car. The hawkers got out more stuff, spread it out\r\nfurther, and waited while the caravan maneuvered itself into parking\r\nspots, spilling out into the street.\r\n\r\nRiders got out of the cars, mostly super-skinny goths -- a line of\r\nspecial low-calorie vegan versions of Victorian organ-meat delicacies\r\nhad turned a mom-and-pop cafe in Portland, Oregon, into a Fortune 500\r\ncompany a few years before -- in elaborate DIY costumery. It shimmered\r\ndarkly, petticoats and toppers, bodices and big stompy boots and\r\ntrousers cut off in ribbons at the knees.\r\n\r\nThe riders converged on one of the straight cars, a beige mini-van,\r\nand crowded around it. A moment later, they were moving toward Perry's\r\nticket-taking stand. The crowd parted as they approached and in Perry\r\nsaw whom they'd been clustered around. It was a skinny goth kid in a\r\nwheelchair like the ones they kept in the ride -- they'd get that\r\nevery now and again, a guest in his own chair, just needing a little\r\nwireless +1/-1 box. His hair was shaggy and black with green\r\nhighlights, stuck out like an anime cosplayer's. He was white as\r\nWonder Bread, with something funny about his mouth. His legs were in\r\ncasts that had been wrapped with black gauze, and a pair of black\r\npointy shoes had been slid over his toes, tipped with elaborate silver\r\ncurlicues.\r\n\r\nThe chair zipped forward and Perry recognized him in a flash: Death\r\nWaits! He felt his mouth drop open and he shut it and came around the\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n\"No way!\" he said, and grabbed Death's hand, encrusted in chunky\r\nsilver jewelry, a different stylized animal skull on each\r\nfinger. Death's ruined mouth pulled up in a kind of smile.\r\n\r\n\"Nice to see you,\" he said, limply squeezing Perry's hand. \"It was\r\nvery kind of you to visit me in the hospital.\"\r\n\r\nPerry thought of all the things that had happened since then and\r\nwondered how much of it, if any, Death had a right to know about. He\r\nleaned in close, conscious of all the observers. \"I'm out of the\r\nlawsuit. We are. Me and Lester. Fired those guys.\" Behind his\r\nreflective contacts, Death's eyes widened a touch.\r\n\r\nHe slumped a little. \"Because of me?\"\r\n\r\nPerry thought some. \"Not exactly. But in a way. It wasn't us.\"\r\n\r\nDeath smiled. \"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nPerry straightened up. \"Looks like you brought down a good crowd,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Lots of friends!\"\r\n\r\nDeath nodded. \"Lots of friends these days,\" he said. An attractive\r\nyoung woman came over and squeezed his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThey were such a funny bunch in their DIY goth-frocks,\r\nmicro-manufactured customized boots, their elaborate tattoos and\r\nimplants and piercings, but for all that, cuddly and earnest with the\r\nshadows visible of the geeks they'd been. Perry felt he was smiling so\r\nbroadly it almost hurt.\r\n\r\n\"Rides are on me, gang,\" he said. \"In you go. Your money's no good\r\nhere. Any friend of Death Waits rides for free today.\"\r\n\r\nThey cheered and patted him on the back as they went through, and\r\nDeath Waits looked like he'd grown three inches in his wheelchair, and\r\nthe pretty girl kissed Perry's cheek as she went by, and Death Waits\r\nhad a smile so big you could hardly tell there was anything wrong with\r\nhis mouth.\r\n\r\nThey rode it through six times in a row, and as they came back around\r\nfor another go and another, they talked intently about the story, the\r\nstory, the story. Perry knew about the story, he'd seen it, and he and\r\nLester had talked it over now and again, but he was still constantly\r\namazed by its ability to inspire riders.\r\n\r\nPaying customers slipped in and out, too, and seemed to catch some of\r\nthe infectious intensity of the story group. They went away in pairs,\r\ntalking about the story, and shopped the market stalls for a while\r\nbefore coming back to ride again, to look for more story.\r\n\r\nThey'd never named the ride. It had always been \"the ride.\" Not even a\r\ncapital \"R.\" For a second, Perry wondered if they'd end up calling it\r\n\"The Story\" in the end.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nPerry got his Disney-in-a-Box through a circuitous route, getting one\r\nof the hawkers' brothers to order it to a PO box in Miami, to which\r\nPerry would drive down to pick it up and take it back.\r\n\r\nLester roused himself from the apartment when Perry told him it had\r\narrived. Lester and Suzanne had been AWOL for days, sleeping in until\r\nPerry left, coming back after Perry came back, until it felt like they\r\nwere just travelers staying in the same hotel.\r\n\r\nHe hadn't heard a peep from Kettlewell or Tjan, either. He guessed\r\nthat they were off figuring things out with their money people. The\r\nnetwork of ride operators had taken the news with equanimity -- Hilda\r\nhad helped him write the message so that it kind of implied that\r\neverything was under control and moving along nicely.\r\n\r\nBut when Perry emailed Lester to say he was going to drive down to the\r\nPO box the next morning before opening the ride, Lester emailed back\r\nin minutes volunteering to come with him.\r\n\r\nHe had coffee ready by the time Perry got out of the shower. It was\r\nstill o-dark-hundred outside, the sun not yet risen, and they hardly\r\nspoke as they got into the car, but soon they were on the open road.\r\n\r\n\"Kettlewell and Tjan aren't going to sue you,\" Lester said. There it\r\nwas, all in a short sentence: *I've been talking to them. I've been\r\nfiguring out if I'm with you or with them. I've been saving your\r\nass. I've been deciding to be on your side.*\r\n\r\n\"Good news,\" Perry said. \"That would have really sucked.\"\r\n\r\nPerry waited for the rest of the drive for Lester to say something,\r\nbut he didn't. It was a long drive.\r\n\r\nThe whole way back, Lester talked about the Disney-in-a-Box. There'd\r\nbeen some alien autopsy videos of them posted online already,\r\nengineers taking them to bits, making guesses about and what they did\r\nand how. Lester had watched the videos avidly and he held his own\r\nopinions, and he was eager to get at the box and find answers for\r\nhimself. It was the size of an ice-chest, too big to fit on his lap,\r\nbut he kept looking over his shoulder at it.\r\n\r\nThe box-art, a glossy pic of two children staring goggle-eyed at a box\r\nfrom which Disneoid marvels were erupting, looked a little like the\r\nMake Your Own Monster toy Perry'd had as a boy. It actually made his\r\nheart skip a beat the way that that old toy had. Really, wasn't that\r\nevery kid's dream? A machine that created wonders from dull feedstock?\r\n\r\nThey got back to the ride long before it was due to open and Perry\r\nasked Lester if he wanted to get a second breakfast in the tea-room in\r\nthe shantytown, but Lester begged off, heading for his workshop to get\r\nto grips with the Box.\r\n\r\nSo Perry alone waited for the ride to open, standing at his familiar\r\nspot behind the counter. The hawkers came and nodded hello to him. A\r\ncustomer showed up. Another. Perry took their money.\r\n\r\nThe ticket-counter smelled of sticky beverages spilled and left to\r\nbake in the heat, a sour-sweet smell like bile. His chair was an\r\nuncomfortable bar-stool he'd gotten from a kitchen-surplus place,\r\nhappy for the bargain. He'd logged a lot of hours in that chair. It\r\nhad wreaked havoc on his lower spine and tenderized his ass.\r\n\r\nHe and Lester had started this as a lark, but now it was a movement,\r\nand not one that was good for his mental health. He didn't want to be\r\nsitting on that stool. He might as well be working in a liquor store\r\n-- the skill-set was the same.\r\n\r\nHilda broke his reverie by calling his phone. \"Hey, gorgeous,\" she\r\nsaid. She bounded out of bed fully formed, without any intervening\r\nstages of pre-coffee, invertebrate, pre-shower, and Homo erectus. He\r\ncould hear that she was ready to catch the world by the ankle and chew\r\nher way up its leg.\r\n\r\n\"Hey,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Uh oh. Mr Badvibes is back. You and Lester fight in the car?\"\r\n\r\n\"Naw,\" he said. \"That was fine. Just...\" He told her about the smell\r\nand the stool and working at a liquor store.\r\n\r\n\"Get one of those home-slices running the market stalls to take over\r\nthe counter, and take me to the beach, then. It's been weeks and I\r\nstill haven't seen the ocean. I'm beginning to think it's an urban\r\nlegend.\"\r\n\r\nSo that's what he did. Hilda drove up in a bikini that made his jaw\r\ndrop, and bought a pair of polarizing contacts from Jason, and Perry\r\nturned the till over to one of the more trustworthy vendors, and they\r\nhit the road.\r\n\r\nHilda nuzzled him and prodded him all the way to the beach, kissing\r\nhim at the red lights. The sky was blue and clear as far as the eye\r\ncould see in all directions, and they bought a bag of oranges, a\r\nnewspaper, beach-blankets, sun-block, a picnic lunch, and a book of\r\nreplica vintage luggage stickers from hawkers at various stop-points.\r\n\r\nThey unpacked the trunk in the parking garage and stepped out into the\r\nbright day, and that's when they noticed the wind. It was blowing so\r\nhard it took Hilda's sarong off as soon as she stepped out onto the\r\nstreet. Perry barely had time to snatch the cloth out of the air. The\r\nwind howled.\r\n\r\nThey looked up and saw the palm-trees bending like drawn bows, the\r\nhot-dog vendors and shave-ice carts and the jewelry hawkers hurriedly\r\npiling everything into their cars.\r\n\r\n\"Guess the beach is cancelled,\" Hilda said, pointing out over the\r\nocean. There, on the horizon, was a wall of black cloud, scudding\r\nrapidly toward them in the raging wind. \"Shoulda checked the weather.\"\r\n\r\nThe wind whipped up stinging clouds of sand and debris. It gusted hard\r\nand actually blew Hilda into Perry. He caught her and they both\r\nlaughed nervously.\r\n\r\n\"Is this a hurricane?\" she asked, joking, not joking, tension in her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Probably not.\" He was thinking of Hurricane Wilma, though, the year\r\nhe'd moved to Florida. No one had predicted Wilma, which had been a\r\ntropical storm miles off the coast until it wasn't, until it was\r\nsmashing a 50km-wide path of destruction from Key West to\r\nKissimmee. He'd been working a straight job as a structural engineer\r\nfor a condo developer, and he'd seen what a good blow could do to the\r\ncondos of Florida, which were built mostly from dreams, promises,\r\nspit, and kleenex.\r\n\r\nWilma had left cars stuck in trees, trees stuck in houses, and it had\r\nblown just like this when it hit. There was a crackle in the air, and\r\nthe sighing of the wind turned to groans, seeming to come from\r\neverywhere at once -- the buildings were moaning in their bones as the\r\nwinds buffeted them.\r\n\r\n\"We have to get out of here,\" Perry said. \"Now.\"\r\n\r\nThey got up to the second storey of the parking garage when the whole\r\nbuilding moaned and shuddered beneath them, like a tremor. They froze\r\non the stairwell. Somewhere in the garage, something crashed into\r\nsomething else with a sound like thunder, and then it was echoed with\r\nan actual thunder-crack, a sound like a hundred rifles fired in\r\nunison.\r\n\r\nHilda looked at him. \"No way. Not further up. Not in this building.\"\r\n\r\nHe agreed. They pelted down the street and into the first sleeting\r\nshowers coming out of a sky that was now dirty grey and low. A\r\nsandwich board advertising energy beverages spun through the air like\r\na razor-edged frisbee, trailing a length of clothesline that had\r\ntethered it to the front of some beach-side cafe. On the beach across\r\nthe road, beachcomber robots burrowed into the sand, trying to get\r\nsafe from the wind, but were foiled again and again, rolled around\r\nlike potato bugs into the street, into the sea, into the\r\nbuildings. They seizured like dying things. Perry felt an irrational\r\nurge to rescue them.\r\n\r\n\"High ground,\" Hilda said, pointing away from the beach. \"High ground\r\nand find a basement. Just like a twister.\"\r\n\r\nA sheet of water lifted off the surface of the sea and swept across\r\nthe road at them, soaking them to the skin, followed by a sheet of\r\nsand that coated them from head to toe. It was all the encouragement\r\nthey needed. They ran.\r\n\r\nThey ran, but the streets were running with rain now and more debris\r\nwas rolling past them. They got up one block and sloshed across the\r\nroad. They made it halfway up the next block, past a coffee shop and a\r\nsurf-shop in low-slung buildings, and the wind literally lifted them\r\noff their feet and slammed them to the ground. Perry grabbed Hilda and\r\ndragged her into an alley behind the surf-shop. There were dumpsters\r\nthere, and a recessed doorway, and they squeezed past the dumpster and\r\ninto the doorway.\r\n\r\nNow in the lee, they realized how loud the storm had been. Their ears\r\nrang with it, and rang again with another thunderclap. Their chests\r\nheaved and they shivered, grabbing each other. The doorway stank of\r\npiss and the crackling ozone around them.\r\n\r\n\"This place, holy fuck, it's about to lift off and fly away,\" Hilda\r\nsaid, panting. Perry's unbroken arm throbbed and he looked down to see\r\na ragged cut running the length of his forearm. From the Dumpster?\r\n\r\n\"It's a big storm,\" Perry said. \"They come through now and\r\nagain. Sometimes they blow away.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do they blow away? Trailers? Apartment buildings?\" They were\r\nboth spitting sand and Perry's arm oozed blood.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes!\" Perry said. They huddled together and listened to the\r\nwind lashing at the buildings around them. The Dumpster blocking their\r\ndoorway groaned, and then it actually slid a few inches. Water coursed\r\ndown the alley before them, with debris caught in it: branches, trash,\r\nthen an electric motorcycle, scratching against the road as it rattled\r\nthrough the river.\r\n\r\nThey watched it pass without speaking, then both of them screamed and\r\nscrambled back as a hissing, soaked house-cat scrambled over the\r\ndumpster, landing practically in their laps, clawing at them with\r\nhysterical viciousness.\r\n\r\n\"Fuck!\" Hilda said as it caught hold of her thumb with its teeth. She\r\npushed at its face ineffectually, hissing with pain, and Perry finally\r\nworked a thumb into the hinge of its jaw and forced it open. The cat\r\nsprang away, clawing up his face, leaping back onto the Dumpster.\r\n\r\nHilda's thumb was punctured many times, already running free with\r\nblood. \"I'm going to need rabies shots,\" she said. \"But I'll live.\"\r\n\r\nThey cuddled, in the blood and the mud, and watched the river swell\r\nand run with more odd debris: clothes and coolers, beer bottles and a\r\nlaptop, cartons of milk and someone's purse. A small palm-tree. A\r\nmailbox. Finally, the river began to wane, the rain to falter.\r\n\r\n\"Was that it?\" Hilda said.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" Perry said. He breathed in the moist air. His arms throbbed\r\n-- one broken, the other torn open. The rain was petering out fast\r\nnow, and looking up, he could see blue sky peeking through the dirty,\r\nheavy clouds, which were scudding away as fast as they'd rolled in.\r\n\r\n\"Next time, we check the weather before we go to the beach,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe laughed and leaned against him and he yelped as she came into\r\ncontact with his hurt arm. \"We got to get you to a hospital,\" she\r\nsaid. \"Get that looked at.\"\r\n\r\n\"You too,\" he said, pointing at her thumb. It was all so weird and\r\nremote now, as they walked through the Miami streets, back toward the\r\ngarage. Other shocked people wandered the streets, weirdly friendly,\r\nsmiling at them like they all shared a secret.\r\n\r\nThe beach-front was in shambles, covered in blown trash and mud,\r\nuprooted trees and fallen leaves, broken glass and rolled cars. Perry\r\nhit the car radio before they pulled out of the garage. An announcer\r\nreported that Tropical Storm Henry had gone about three miles inland\r\nbefore petering out to a mere sun-shower, along with news about the\r\nfreeways and hospitals being equally jammed.\r\n\r\n\"Huh,\" Perry said. \"Well, what do we do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's find a hotel room,\" Hilda said. \"Have showers, get something to\r\neat.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a weird and funny idea, and Perry liked it. He'd never played\r\ntourist in Florida, but what better place to do so? They gathered\r\ntheir snacks from the back of the car and used the first aid kit in\r\nthe trunk to tape themselves up.\r\n\r\nThey tried to reach Lester but no one answered. \"He's probably at the\r\nride,\" Perry said. \"Or balls-deep in reverse-engineering the Disney\r\nBox thing. OK, let's find a hotel room.\"\r\n\r\nEverything on the beach was fully booked, but as they continued inland\r\nfor a couple blocks, they came upon coffin hotels stacked four or five\r\ncapsules high, painted gay Miami deco pastels, installed in rows in\r\nold storefronts or stuck in street-parking spots, their silvered\r\nwindows looking out over the deserted boulevards.\r\n\r\n\"Should we?\" Perry said, gesturing at them.\r\n\r\n\"If we can get an empty one? Damn right -- these things are going to\r\nbe in serious demand in pretty short order.\"\r\n\r\nStepping into the coffin hotel transported Perry back to his days on\r\nthe road, his days staying at coffin hotel after coffin hotel, to his\r\nfirst night with Hilda, in Madison. One look at Hilda told him she\r\nfelt the same. They washed each other slowly, as though they were\r\nunderwater, cleaning out one-another's wounds, sluicing away the caked\r\non mud and grime blown deep into their ears and the creases of their\r\nskin, nestled against their scalps.\r\n\r\nThey lay down in bed, naked, together, spooned against one\r\nanother. \"You're a good man, Perry Gibbons,\" Hilda said, snuggling\r\nagainst him, hand moving in slow circles on his tummy.\r\n\r\nThey slept that way and got back on the road long past dark, driving\r\nthe blasted freeway slowly, moving around the broken glass and blown\r\nout tires that remained.\r\n\r\nThe path of the hurricane followed the coast straight to Hollywood, a\r\nline of smashed trees and car wrecks and blown-off roofs that made the\r\nnighttime drive even more disorienting.\r\n\r\nThey went straight back to the condo, but Lester wasn't there. Worry\r\nnagged at Perry. \"Take me to the ride?\" he said, after he'd paced the\r\napartment a few times.\r\n\r\nHilda looked up from the sofa, where she had collapsed the instant\r\nthey came through the door, arm flung over her face. \"You're shitting\r\nme,\" she said. \"It's nearly midnight, and we've been in a hurricane.\"\r\n\r\nPerry squirmed. \"I've got a bad feeling, OK? And I can't drive\r\nmyself.\" He flapped his busted arm at her.\r\n\r\nHilda looked at him, her eyes narrowed. \"Look, don't be a jerk, OK?\r\nLester's a big boy. He's probably just out with Suzanne. He'd have\r\ncalled you if there'd been a problem.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, bewildered by the ferocity of her response. \"OK,\r\nI'll call a cab,\" he said, trying for a middle ground.\r\n\r\nShe jumped up from the couch. \"Whatever. Fine. Let me get my\r\nkeys. Jesus.\"\r\n\r\nHe had no idea how he'd angered her, but it was clear that he had, and\r\nthe last thing he wanted was to get into a car with her, but he\r\ncouldn't think of a way of saying that without escalating things.\r\n\r\nSo they drove in white-lipped silence to the ride, Hilda tense with\r\nanger, Perry tense with worry, both of them touchy as cats, neither\r\nsaying a word.\r\n\r\nBut when they pulled up to the ride, they both let out a gasp. It was\r\nlit with rigged floodlights and car headlights, and it was swarming\r\nwith people. As they drew closer, they saw that the market stalls were\r\nstrewn across the parking lot, in smashed pieces. As they drew closer\r\nstill, they saw that the ride itself was staring eyeless at them,\r\nwindow-glass smashed.\r\n\r\nPerry was out of the car even before it stopped rolling, Hilda\r\nshouting something after him. Lester was just on the other side of the\r\nride-entrance, wearing a paper mask and rubber boots, wading in\r\nthree-inch deep, scummy water.\r\n\r\nPerry splashed to a halt. \"Holy shit,\" he breathed. The ride was lit\r\nwith glow-sticks, waterproof lamps, and LED torches, and the lights\r\nreflected crazily from the still water that filled it as far as the\r\neye could see, way out into the gloom.\r\n\r\nLester looked up at him. His face was lined and exhausted, and it\r\ngleamed with sweat. \"Storm broke out all the windows and trashed the\r\nroof, then flooded us out. It did a real number on the market, too.\"\r\nHis voice was dead.\r\n\r\nPerry was wordless. Bits of the ride-exhibits floated in the water,\r\nalong with the corpses of the robots.\r\n\r\n\"No drainage,\" Lester said. \"The code says drainage, but there's none\r\nhere. I never noticed it before. I'm going to rig a pump, but my\r\nworkshop's pretty much toast.\" Lester's workshop had been in the old\r\ngarden-center at the side of the ride. It was all glass. \"We had some\r\npretty amazing winds.\"\r\n\r\nPerry felt like he should be showing off his wound to prove that he\r\nhadn't been fucking off while the disaster was underway, but he\r\ncouldn't bring himself to do so. \"We got caught in it in Miami,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Wondered where you were. The kid who was minding the shop just cut\r\nand run when the storm rolled in.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did? Christ, what an irresponsible asshole. I'll break his neck.\"\r\n\r\nA slimy raft of kitchen gnomes -- their second business venture --\r\nfloated past silently in the harsh watery light. The smell was almost\r\nunbearable.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't his job --\" Lester's voice cracked on *job*, and he\r\nbreathed deeply. \"It wasn't his job, Perry. It was your job. You're\r\nrunning around, having a good time with your girlfriend, firing\r\nlawyers --\" He stopped and breathed again. \"You know that they're\r\ngoing to sue us, right? They're going to turn us into a smoking ruin\r\nbecause you fired them, and what the fuck are you going to do about\r\nthat? Whose job is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you said they weren't going to sue,\" Perry said. It came\r\nout in an embarrassed mumble. Lester had never talked to him like\r\nthis. Never.\r\n\r\n\"Kettlewell and Tjan aren't going to sue,\" Lester said. \"The lawyers\r\nyou fired, the venture capitalists who backed them? They're going to\r\nturn us into paste.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you have preferred?\" Hilda said. She was standing in the\r\ndoorway, away from the flood, watching them intently. Her eyes were\r\nraccoon-bagged, but she was rigid with anger. Perry could hardly look\r\nat her. \"Would you have preferred to have those fuckers go around\r\ndestroying the lives of your supporters in order to enrich a few pig\r\nassholes?\"\r\n\r\nLester just looked at her.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, Yoko,\" he said. \"We're having a private conversation here.\"\r\n\r\nPerry's jaw dropped, and Hilda was already in motion, sloshing into\r\nthe water in her sandals. She smacked Lester across the cheek, a crack\r\nthat echoed back over the water and walls.\r\n\r\nLester brought his hand up to his reddening face. \"Are you done?\" he\r\nsaid, his voice hard.\r\n\r\nHilda looked at Perry. Lester looked at Perry. Perry looked at the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"I'll meet you by the car,\" Perry said. It came out in a mumble. They\r\nheld for a moment, the three of them, then Hilda walked out again,\r\nleaving Lester and Perry looking at one another.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"About Hilda? About the lawsuits? About skipping out?\"\r\n\r\n\"About everything,\" he said. \"Let's fix this up, OK?\"\r\n\r\n\"The ride? I don't even know if I want to. Why bother? It'll cost a\r\nfortune to get it online, and they'll only shut it down again with the\r\nlawsuit. Why bother.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we won't fix the ride. Let's fix us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why bother,\" Lester said, and it came out in the same mumble.\r\n\r\nThe watery sounds of the room and the smell and the harsh reflected\r\nrippling light made Perry want to leave. \"Lester --\" he began.\r\n\r\nLester shook his head. \"There's nothing more we can do tonight,\r\nanyway. I'll rent a pump in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it,\" Perry said. \"You work on the Disney-in-a-Box thing.\"\r\n\r\nLester laughed, a bitter sound. \"Yeah, OK, buddy. Sure.\"\r\n\r\nOut in the parking-lot, the hawkers were putting their stalls back\r\ntogether as best they could. The shantytown was lit up and Perry\r\nwondered how it had held together. Pretty good, is what he guessed --\r\nthey met and exceeded county code on all of those plans.\r\n\r\nHilda honked the horn at him. She was fuming behind the wheel and they\r\ndrove in silence. He felt numb and wrung out and he didn't know what\r\nto say to her. He lay awake in bed that night waiting to hear Lester\r\ncome home, but he didn't.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSammy loved his morning meetings. They all came to his office, all the\r\ndifferent park execs, creatives, and emissaries from the old partner\r\ncompanies that had spun off to make movies and merch and educational\r\nmaterials. They all came each day to talk to him about the next day's\r\nDisney-in-a-Box build. They all came to beg him to think about adding\r\nin something from their franchises and cantons to the next\r\ninstallment.\r\n\r\nThere were over a million DiaBs in the field now, and they weren't\r\neven trying to keep up with orders anymore. Sammy loved looking at the\r\nonline auction sites to see what the boxes were going for -- he knew\r\nthat some of his people had siphoned off a carload or two of the\r\nthings to e-tail out the back door. He loved that. Nothing was a\r\nbetter barometer of your success than having made something other\r\npeople cared enough about to steal.\r\n\r\nHe loved his morning meetings, and he conducted them with the flair of\r\na benevolent emperor. He'd gotten a bigger office -- technically it\r\nwas a board-room for DiaB strategy, but Sammy *was* the DiaB\r\nstrategy. He'd outfitted it with fan-photos of their DiaB shrines in\r\ntheir homes, with kids watching enthralled as the day's model was\r\nassembled before their eyes. The hypnotic fascination in their eyes\r\nwas unmistakable. Disney was the focus of their daily lives, and all\r\nthey wanted was more, more, more. He could push out five models a day,\r\nten, and they'd go nuts for them.\r\n\r\nBut he wouldn't. He was too cunning. One model a day was all. Leave\r\nthem wanting more. Never breathe a hint of what the next day's model\r\nwould be -- oh, how he loved to watch the blogs and the chatter as the\r\nmodels self-assembled, the heated, time-bound fights over what the\r\nday's model was going to be.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Ron,\" he said. Wiener had been lobbying to get a Main\r\nStreet build into the models for weeks now, and Sammy was taking great\r\npleasure in denying it to him without shutting down all hope. Getting\r\nRon Wiener to grovel before him every morning was better than a cup of\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n\"I've been thinking about what you said, and you're right,\" Wiener\r\nsaid. He always started the meeting by telling Sammy how right he was\r\nto reject his last idea. \"The flag-pole and marching-band scene would\r\nhave too many pieces. House cats would knock it over. We need\r\nsomething more unitary, more visually striking. So here's what I've\r\nbeen thinking: what about the fire-engine?\"\r\n\r\nSammy raised an indulgent eyebrow.\r\n\r\n\"Kids *love* fire trucks. All the colors are in the printer's gamut --\r\nI checked. We could create a Mickey-and-Friends fire-crew to position\r\naround it, a little barn for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The only thing I liked about firetrucks when I was a kid was that the\r\nword started with 'f' and ended with 'uck' --\" Sammy smiled when he\r\nsaid it, and waited for Wiener to fake hilarity, too. The others in\r\nthe room -- other park execs, some of their licensing partners, a few\r\nadvertisers -- laughed too. Officially, this was a \"brainstorming\r\nsession,\" but everyone knew that it was all about getting the nod from\r\nSammy.\r\n\r\nWiener laughed dutifully and slunk away. More supplicants came\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\"How about this?\" She was very cute -- dressed in smart, dark clothes\r\nthat were more Lower East Side than Orlando. She smelled good, too --\r\none of the new colognes that hinted at free monomers, like hot plastic\r\nor a new-bought tire. Cat-slanted green eyes completed the package.\r\n\r\n\"What you got there?\" She was from an ad agency, someone Disney Parks\r\nhad done business with at some point. Agencies had been sending their\r\npeople to these meetings too, trying to get a co-branding coup for one\r\nof their clients.\r\n\r\n\"It's a series of three, telling a little story. Beginning, middle and\r\nend. The first one is a family sitting down to breakfast, and you can\r\nsee, it's the same old crap, boring microwave omelets and breakfast\r\npuddings. Mom's bored, dad's more bored, and sis and brother here are\r\nsecretly dumping theirs onto mom's and dad's plates. All this stuff is\r\nrun using the same printers, so it looks very realistic.\"\r\n\r\nIt did indeed. Sammy hadn't thought about it, but he supposed it was\r\nonly natural that the omelets were printed -- how else could General\r\nMills get that uniformity? He should talk to some of the people in\r\nfood services about getting some of that tech to work at the parks.\r\n\r\n\"So in part two, they're setting up the kitchen around this mystery\r\nbox -- one part Easy-Bake lightbulb oven, one part Tardis. You know\r\nwhat that is?\"\r\n\r\nSammy grinned. \"Why yes, I believe I do.\" Their eyes met in a fierce\r\nlook of mutual recognition. \"It's a breakfast printer, isn't it?\" The\r\nother supplicants in the room sucked in a collective breath. Some\r\nchuckled nervously.\r\n\r\n\"It's about moving the apparatus to the edge. Bridging the last\r\nmile. Why not? This one will do waffles, breakfast cereals, bagels and\r\nbaked goods, small cakes. New designs every day -- something for mom\r\nand dad, something for the kids, something for the sullen teens. We're\r\nalready doing this at the regional plants and distributorships, on\r\nmuch larger scales. But getting our stuff into consumers' homes,\r\ngetting them *subscribed* to our food --\"\r\n\r\nSammy held up a hand. \"I see,\" he said. \"And our people are already\r\nprimed for home-printing experiences. They're right in your sweet\r\nspot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Part three, Junior and little sis are going cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs,\r\nbut these things are shaped *like them*, with their portraits on each\r\nsugar-lump. Mom and dad are eating tres sophistique croissants and\r\ndelicate cakes. Look at Rover here, with his own cat-shaped\r\ndog-biscuit. See how happy they all are?\"\r\n\r\nSammy nodded. \"Shouldn't this all be under nondisclosure?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Probably, but what are you gonna do? You guys are pretty good at\r\nkeeping secrets, and if you decide to shaft us by selling out to one\r\nof our competitors, we're probably dead, anyway. I'll be able to ship\r\nout half a million units in the first week, then we can ramp\r\nproduction if need be -- lots of little parts-and-assembly\r\nsubcontractors will take the work if we offer.\"\r\n\r\nSammy liked the way she talked. Like someone who didn't need to spend\r\na lot of time screwing around, planning, like someone who could just\r\nmake it happen.\r\n\r\n\"You're launching when?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three days after you start running this campaign,\" she said, without\r\nbatting an eyelash.\r\n\r\n\"My name's Sammy,\" he said. \"How's Thursday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Launch on Sunday?\" She shook her head. \"It's tricky, Sunday\r\nlaunches. Gotta pay everyone scale-and-a-half.\" She gave him a\r\nwink. \"What the hell, it's not my money.\" She stuck out her hand. She\r\nwas wearing a couple of nice chunky obsidian rings in abstract curvy\r\nshapes, looking a little porny in their suggestion of breasts and\r\nthighs. He shook her hand and it was warm and dry and strong.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's this week taken care of,\" Sammy said, and pointedly\r\ncleared the white-board surface running the length of the table. The\r\nothers groaned and got up and filed out. The woman stayed behind.\r\n\r\n\"Dinah,\" she said. She handed him a card and he noted the\r\nagency. Dallas-based, not New York, but he could tell she was a\r\ntransplant.\r\n\r\n\"You got any breakfast plans?\" It was hardly gone 9AM -- Sammy liked\r\nto get these meetings started early. \"I normally get something sent\r\nin, but your little prototypes there...\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. It was a pretty laugh. She was a couple years older than\r\nhim, and she wore it well. \"Do I have breakfast plans? Sammy my boy,\r\nI'm nothing *but* breakfast plans! I have a launch on Sunday,\r\nremember?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heh. Oh yeah.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm on the next flight to DFW,\" she said. \"I've got a cab waiting to\r\ntake me to the airport.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if you and I need to talk over some details,\" Sammy said.\r\n\r\n\"Only if you want to do it in the taxi.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking we could do it on the plane,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You're going to buy a ticket?\"\r\n\r\n\"On my plane,\" he said. They'd given him use of one of the company\r\njets when he started really ramping production on the DiaBs.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I think that can be arranged,\" she said. \"It's Sammy, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" he said. They left the building and had an altogether lovely\r\nflight to Dallas. Very productive.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nLester hadn't left Suzanne's apartment in days. She'd rented a place\r\nin the shantytown -- bemused at the idea of paying rent to a squatter,\r\nbut pleased to have a place of her own now that Lester and Perry's\r\napartment had become so tense.\r\n\r\nTechnically, he was working on the Disney printers, which she found\r\ninteresting in an abstract way. They had a working one and a couple of\r\ndisassembled ones, and watching the working one do its thing was\r\nfascinating for a day or two, but then it was just a three-d TV with\r\none channel, broadcasting one frame per day.\r\n\r\nShe dutifully wrote about it, though, and about Perry's ongoing\r\nefforts to re-open the ride. She got the sense from him that he was\r\nheading for flat-ass broke. Lester and he had always been casual about\r\nmoney, but buying all new robots, more printers, replacement windows,\r\nfixing the roof -- none of it was cheap. And with the market in\r\npieces, he wasn't getting any rent.\r\n\r\nShe looked over Lester's shoulder for the fiftieth time. \"How's it\r\ngoing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't write about this, OK?\"\r\n\r\nHe'd never said that to her.\r\n\r\n\"I'll embargo it until you ship.\"\r\n\r\nHe grunted. \"Fine, I guess. OK, well, I've got it running on generic\r\ngoop, that part was easy. I can also load my own designs, but that\r\nrequires physical access to the thing, in order to load new\r\nfirmware. They don't make it easy, which is weird. It's like they\r\ndon't plan on updating it once it's in the field -- maybe they just\r\nplan on replacing them at regular intervals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why's the firmware matter to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's where it stores information about where to get the day's\r\ndesigns. If we're going to push our own designs to it, we need to give\r\npeople an easy way to tell it to tune in to our feed, and the best way\r\nto do that is to change the firmware. The alternative would be, oh, I\r\ndon't know, putting another machine upstream of it to trick it into\r\nthinking that it's accessing their site when it's really going to\r\nours. That means getting people to configure another machine -- no one\r\nbut a few hardcore geeks will want to do that.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne nodded. She wondered if \"a few hardcore geeks\" summed up the\r\ntotal audience for this project in any event. She didn't mention it,\r\nthough. Lester's brow was so furrowed you could lose a dime in the\r\ncrease above his nose.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sure you'll get it,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. It's just a matter of getting at the boot-loader. I could\r\ntotally do this if I could get at the boot-loader.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne knew what a boot-loader was, just barely. The thing that chose\r\nwhich OS to load when you turned it on. She wondered if every daring,\r\nsexy technology project started like this, a cranky hacker muttering\r\nangrily about boot-loaders.\r\n\r\nSuzanne missed Russia. She'd had a good life there, covering the\r\nbiotech scene. Those hackers were a lot scarier than Lester and Perry,\r\nbut they were still lovable and fascinating in their own way. Better\r\nthan the Ford and GM execs she used to have to cozy up to.\r\n\r\nShe'd liked the manic hustle of Russia, the glamour and the\r\nsqualor. She'd bought a time-share dacha that she could spend weekends\r\nat, and the ex-pats in Petersburg had rollicking parties and dinners\r\nwhere they took apart the day's experiences on Planet Petrograd.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going out, Lester,\" she said. Lester looked up from the DiaB and\r\nblinked a few times, then seemed to rewind the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Hey,\" he said. \"Oh, hey. Sorry, Suzanne. I'm just -- I'm trying to\r\nwork instead of think these days. Thinking just makes me angry. I\r\ndon't know what to do --\" He broke off and thumped the side of the\r\nprinter.\r\n\r\n\"How's Perry getting on with rebuilding?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's getting on,\" Lester said. \"As far as I know. I read that the\r\nDeath Waits kid and his people had come by to help. Whatever that\r\nmeans.\"\r\n\r\n\"He freaks me out,\" Suzanne said. \"I mean, I feel terrible for him,\r\nand he seemed nice enough in the hospital. But all those people -- the\r\nway they follow him around. It's just weird. Like the charismatic\r\ncults back home.\" She realized she'd just called Russia \"home\" and it\r\nmade her frown. Just how long was she going to stay here with these\r\npeople, anyway?\r\n\r\nLester hadn't noticed. \"I guess they all feel sorry for him. And they\r\nlike what he has to say about stories. I just can't get a lot of spit\r\nin my mouth over the ride these days, though. It feels like something\r\nwe did and completed and should move on from.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne didn't have anything to say, and Lester wasn't particularly\r\nexpecting anything, he was giving off a palpable let-me-work vibe, so\r\nshe let herself out of the apartment -- her apartment! -- and headed\r\nout into the shantytown. On the way to the ride, she passed the little\r\ntea-house where Kettlewell and Tjan had done their scheming and she\r\nsuddenly felt very, very old. The only grownup on-site.\r\n\r\nShe was about to cross the freeway to the ride when her phone\r\nrang. She looked at the face and then nearly dropped it. Freddy was\r\ncalling her.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Suzanne,\" he said. The gloat in his voice was unmistakable. He\r\nhad something really slimy up his sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"How can I help you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm calling for comment on a story,\" he said. \"It's my understanding\r\nthat your lad, Perry, pitched a tantie and fired the business-managers\r\nof the ride, and has told the lawyers representing him against Disney\r\nthat he intends to drop the suit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there a question in there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there are many questions in there, my darling. For starters, I\r\nwondered how it could possibly be true if you haven't written about it\r\non your little 'blog' --\" even over the phone, she could hear the\r\nsarcastic quotes. \"-- You seem to be quite comprehensive in\r\ndocumenting the undertakings of your friends down there in Florida.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you asking me to comment on why I haven't commented?\"\r\n\r\n\"For starters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you approached Perry for a comment?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid he was rather abrupt. And I couldn't reach his Valkyrie of\r\nthe Midwest, either. So I'm left calling on you, Suzanne. Any\r\ncomment?\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne stared across the road at the ride. She'd been gassed there,\r\nchased by armed men, watched a war there.\r\n\r\n\"The ride doesn't have much formal decision-making process,\" she said\r\nfinally. \"That means that words like 'fired' don't really apply\r\nhere. The boys might have a disagreement about the best way to\r\nproceed, but if that's the case, you'll have to talk to them about\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you saying that you don't know if your boyfriend's best friend is\r\nfighting with his business partners? Don't you all live together?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm saying that if you want to find out what Lester and Perry are\r\ndoing, you'll have to ask Lester and Perry.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the living together thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't live together,\" she said. It was technically true.\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" Freddy said.\r\n\r\n\"Do we have a bad connection?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't live together?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you live then?\"\r\n\r\n\"My place,\" she said. \"Have your informants been misinforming you? I\r\nhope you haven't been paying for your information, Freddy. I suppose\r\nyou don't, though. I suppose there's no end of cranks who really enjoy\r\nspiteful gossip and are more than happy to email you whatever\r\nfantasies they concoct.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy tsked. \"And you don't know what's happened to Kettlewell and\r\nTjan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you asked them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" he said. \"But since you're the ranking reporter on the\r\nscene.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm just a blogger, Freddy. A busy blogger. Good afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nThe call left her shaking, though she was proud of how calm she'd kept\r\nher voice. What a goddamned troll. And she was going to have to write\r\nabout this now.\r\n\r\nThere were ladders leaned up against the edge of the ride, and a\r\nmotley crew of roofers and glaziers on them and on the roof, working\r\nto replace the gaping holes the storm had left. The workers mostly\r\nwore black and had dyed hair and lots of metal flashing from their\r\nears and faces as they worked. A couple had stripped to the waist,\r\nrevealing full-back tattoos or even more piercings and subcutaneous\r\nimplants, like armor running over their spines and shoulder-blades. A\r\ncouple of boom-boxes blasted out grinding, incoherent music with a lot\r\nof electronic screams.\r\n\r\nAround the ride, the market-stalls were coming back, rebuilt from a\r\ntower of fresh-sawed lumber stacked in the parking-lot. This was a lot\r\nmore efficient, with gangs of vendors quickly sawing the lumber to\r\nstandard sizes, slapping each one with a positional sensor, then\r\nwatching the sensor's lights to tell them when it was properly lined\r\nup with its mates, and then slipping on corner-clips that held it all\r\ntogether. Suzanne watched as a whole market stall came together this\r\nway, in the space of five minutes, before the vendors moved on to\r\ntheir next stall. It was like a high-tech version of an Amish\r\nbarn-raising, performed by bandanna-clad sketchy hawkers instead of\r\nbearded technophobes.\r\n\r\nShe found Perry inside, leaning over a printer, tinkering with its\r\nguts, LED torches clipped to the temples of his glasses. He was\r\nhampered by having only one good arm, and he pressed her into service\r\npassing him tools for a good fifteen minutes before he straightened up\r\nand really looked at her.\r\n\r\n\"You come down to help out?\"\r\n\r\n\"To write about it, actually.\"\r\n\r\nThe room was a hive of activity. A lot of goth kids of various ages\r\nand degrees of freakiness, a few of the squatter kids, some people she\r\nrecognized from the second coming of Death Waits. She couldn't see\r\nDeath Waits, though.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's good.\" He powered up the printer and the air filled with\r\nthe familiar smell of Saran-Wrap-in-a-microwave. She had an eerie\r\nflashback to her first visit to this place, when they'd showed her how\r\nthey could print mutated, Warhol-ized Barbie heads. \"How's Lester\r\ngetting on with cracking that printer?\"\r\n\r\n*Why don't you ask him yourself?* She didn't say it. She didn't know\r\n why Lester had come to her place after the flood instead of going\r\n home, why he stiffened up and sniffed when she mentioned Perry's\r\n name, why he looked away when she mentioned Hilda.\r\n\r\n\"Something about firmware.\"\r\n\r\nHe straightened his back more, making it pop and gave her his devilish\r\ngrin, the one where his wonky eyebrow went up and down. \"It's always\r\nfirmware,\" he said, and laughed a little. Maybe they were both\r\nremembering those old days, the Boogie Woogie Elmos.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like you've got a lot of help,\" Suzanne said, getting out a\r\nlittle steno pad and a pen.\r\n\r\nPerry nodded at it, and she was struck by how many times they'd stood\r\nlike this, a few feet apart, her pen poised over her pad. She'd\r\nchronicled so much of this man's life.\r\n\r\n\"They're good people, these folks. Some of them have some carpentry or\r\nelectronics experience, the rest are willing to learn. It's going\r\nfaster than I thought it would. Lots of support from out in the world,\r\ntoo -- people sending in cash to help with replacement parts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard from Kettlewell or Tjan?\"\r\n\r\nThe light went out of his face. \"No,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"How about from the lawyers?\"\r\n\r\n\"No comment,\" he said. It didn't sound like a joke.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Perry. People are starting to ask questions. Someone's going\r\nto write about this. Do you want your side told or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not,\" he said, and disappeared back into the guts of the printer.\r\n\r\nShe stared at his back for a long while before turning on her heel,\r\nmuttering, \"Fuck,\" and walking back out into the sunshine. There'd\r\nbeen a musty smell in the ride, but out here it was the Florida smell\r\nof citrus and car-fumes, and sweat from the people around her, working\r\nhard, trying to wrest a living from the world.\r\n\r\nShe walked back across the freeway to the shantytown and ran into\r\nHilda coming the other way. The younger woman gave her a cool look and\r\nthen looked away, and crossed.\r\n\r\nThat was just about enough, Suzanne thought. Enough playtime with the\r\nkids. Time to go find some grownups. She wasn't here for her\r\nhealth. If Lester didn't want to hang out with her, if Perry had had\r\nenough of her, it was time to go do something else.\r\n\r\nShe went back to her room, where Lester was still working on his DiaB\r\nproject. She took out her suitcase and packed with the efficiency of\r\nlong experience. Lester didn't notice, not even when she took the\r\nblouse she'd hand-washed and hung to dry on the back of his chair,\r\nfolded it and put it in her suitcase and zipped it shut.\r\n\r\nShe looked at his back working over the bench for a long time. He had\r\na six-pack of chocolate pudding beside him, and a wastebasket\r\noverflowing with food wrappers and boxes. He shifted in his seat and\r\nlet out a soft fart.\r\n\r\nShe left. She paid the landlady through the end of the week. She could\r\nsend Lester an email later.\r\n\r\nThe cab took her to Miami. It wasn't until she got to the airport that\r\nshe realized she had no idea where she was going. Boston? San\r\nFrancisco? Petersburg? She opened her laptop and began to price out\r\nlast minute tickets. The rush of travelers moved around her and she\r\nwas jostled many times.\r\n\r\nThe standby sites gave her a thousand options -- Miami to JFK to\r\nHeathrow to Petersburg, Miami to Frankfurt to Moscow to Petersburg,\r\nMiami to Dallas to San Francisco.... The permutations were\r\noverwhelming, especially since she wasn't sure where she wanted to be.\r\n\r\nThen she heard something homey and familiar: a large group of Russian\r\ntourists walking past, talking loudly in Russian, complaining about\r\nthe long flight, the bad food, and the incompetence of their tour\r\noperator. She smiled to see the old men with their high-waisted pants\r\nand the old women with their bouffant hair.\r\n\r\nShe couldn't help but eavesdrop -- at their volume, she would have\r\nbeen hard-pressed *not* to listen in. A little boy and girl tore ass\r\naround the airport, under the disapproving glares from DHS goons, and\r\nthey screamed as they ran, \"Disney World! Disney World! Disney World!\"\r\n\r\nShe'd never been -- she'd been to a couple of the kitschy Gulag parks\r\nin Russia, and she'd grown up with Six Flags coaster parks and Ontario\r\nPlace and the CNE in Toronto, not far from Detroit. But she'd never\r\nbeen to The Big One, the place that even now managed to dominate the\r\nworld's consciousness of theme-parks.\r\n\r\nShe asked her standby sites to find her a room in a Disney hotel\r\ninstead, looking for an inclusive rate that would get her onto the\r\nrides and pay for her meals. These were advertised at roadside kiosks\r\nat 100-yard intervals on every freeway in Florida, so she suspected\r\nthey were the best deal going.\r\n\r\nA moment of browsing showed her that she'd guessed wrong. A week in\r\nDisney cost a heart-stopping sum of money -- the equivalent of six\r\nmonths' rent in Petersburg. How did all these Russians afford this\r\ntrip? What the hell compelled people to part with these sums?\r\n\r\nShe was going to have to find out. It was research. Plus she needed a\r\nvacation.\r\n\r\nShe booked in, bought a bullet-train ticket, and grabbed the handle of\r\nher suitcase. She examined her welcome package as she waited for the\r\ntrain. She was staying at something called the Polynesian Resort\r\nhotel, and the brochure showed a ticky-tacky tiki-themed set of\r\nlonghouses set on an ersatz white-sand beach, with a crew of Mexican\r\nand Cuban domestic workers in leis, Hawai'ian shirts, and lava-lavas\r\nwaving and smiling. Her package included a complimentary luau -- the\r\npictures made it clear this was nothing like the tourist luaus she'd\r\nattended in Maui. On top of that, she was entitled to a \"character\r\nbreakfast\" with a wage-slave in an overheated plush costume, and an\r\nhour with a \"resort counsellor\" who'd help her plan her trip for\r\nmaximal fun.\r\n\r\nThe bullet-train came and took on the passengers, families bouncing\r\nwith anticipation, joking and laughing in every language spoken. These\r\npeople had just come through a US Customs checkpoint and they were\r\nacting like the world was a fine place. She decided there must be\r\nsomething to this Disney business.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDeath Waits waited, and waited and waited for the ride to come back\r\nonline. He split his days between hanging out at home, writing about\r\nthe story, running the fly-throughs from the other rides, watching\r\nwhat was happening in Brazil, answering his fan-mail; the rest of the\r\ntime he spent with his new friends down at the site of the ride,\r\nencouraging them to pitch in and help Perry and Lester to get the\r\nthing back up and running. Fast, please. It was driving him bonkers\r\nnot to be able to ride any longer. After everything he'd been through,\r\nhe deserved a ride.\r\n\r\nHis friends were wonderful. Wonderful! Lacey especially. She was a\r\nnurse and a goddess of mercy. The money that flooded into his paypals\r\nwhenever his friends let it be known that he needed more covered all\r\nhis expenses. He never wanted for companionship, conversation,\r\nhelpmeets, or respect. It was a wonderful life.\r\n\r\nIf only the ride would come online.\r\n\r\nHe woke next to Lacey, she asleep still, her hair spread out across\r\nthe pillow in a fall of shiny black with blue highlights -- she'd\r\ngiven him a matching dye-job a few days before and they looked like a\r\nmatched set now. He let his hands lazily trace her soft skin, the\r\noutlines of her tattoos, her implants and piercings. He felt a\r\nstirring between his legs.\r\n\r\nLacey yawned and woke and kissed him. \"Good morning, my handsome man,\"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, my beautiful woman. What's the plan for today?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you want,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Breakfast, then down to the ride,\" he said. \"I'll do my email and\r\nwriting there today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something before breakfast?\" she asked, with a lopsided smile that\r\nwas adorable.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, please,\" he said, his voice breathy.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe smell at the Wal-Mart was overpowering. It was one part sharp\r\nmold, one part industrial disinfectant, a citrus smell that made your\r\neyes water and your sinuses burn.\r\n\r\n\"I've rented some big blowers,\" Perry said. \"They'll help air the\r\nplace out. If that doesn't work, I might have to resurface the floor,\r\nwhich would be rough -- it could take a week to get that done\r\nproperly.\"\r\n\r\n\"A week?\" Death said. Jesus. No way. Not another week. He didn't know\r\nit for sure, but he had a feeling that a lot of these people would\r\nstop showing up eventually if there was no ride for them to geek out\r\nover. He sure would.\r\n\r\n\"You smell that? We can't close the doors and the windows and leave it\r\nlike this.\"\r\n\r\nDeath's people, standing around them, listening in, nodded. It was\r\ntrue. You'd melt people's lungs if you shut them up with these fumes.\r\n\r\n\"How can I help?\" Death said. It was his constant mantra with\r\nPerry. Sometimes he didn't think Perry liked him very much, and it was\r\ngood to keep on reminding him that Death and his buddies were here to\r\nbe part of the solution. That Perry needed them.\r\n\r\n\"The roof is just about done, the robots are back online. The dividers\r\nshould be done today. I've got the chairs stripped down for routine\r\nmaintenance, I could use a couple people for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's Lester working on?\" Death said.\r\n\r\n\"You'd have to ask him.\"\r\n\r\nDeath hadn't seen Lester in days, which was weird. He hoped Lester\r\ndidn't dislike him. He worried a lot about whether people liked him\r\nthese days. He'd thought that Sammy liked him, after all.\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know.\"\r\n\r\nPerry put dark glasses on.\r\n\r\nDeath Waits took the hint. \"Come on,\" he said to Lacey, who patted him\r\non the hand as he lifted up in his chair and rolled out to the\r\nvan. \"Let's just call him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lo?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Death Waits. We're down at the ride, but there's not much to do\r\naround here. I thought maybe we could help you with whatever you were\r\nworking on?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you know about what I'm working on?\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"Um. Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"So how do you know you want to help?\"\r\n\r\nDeath Waits closed his eyes. He wanted to help these two. They'd made\r\nsomething important, didn't they know that?\r\n\r\n\"What are you working on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" Death said. \"Come on. We just want to pitch in. I love you\r\nguys. You changed my life. Let me contribute.\"\r\n\r\nLester snorted. \"Cross the road, go straight for two hundred yards,\r\nturn left at the house with the Cesar Chavez mural, and I'll meet you\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean go into the --\" Death didn't know what it was called. He\r\nalways tried not to look at it when he came to the ride. That slum\r\nacross the road. He knew it was somehow connected with the ride, but\r\nin the same way that the administrative buildings at Disney were\r\nconnected with the parks. The big difference was that Disney's\r\nextraneous buildings were shielded from view by berms and painted\r\ngo-away green. The weird town across the road was *right there*.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, across the road into the shantytown.\"\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" Death said. \"See you soon.\" He hung up and patted Lacey's\r\nhand. \"We're going over there,\" he said, pointing into the shantytown.\r\n\r\n\"Is it safe?\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged. \"I guess so.\" He loved his chair, loved how tall it made\r\nhim, loved how it turned him into a half-ton cyborg who could raise up\r\non his rear wheels and rock back and forth like a triffid. Now he felt\r\nvery vulnerable -- a crippled cyborg whose apparatus cost a small\r\nfortune, about to go into a neighborhood full of people who were\r\ntechnically homeless.\r\n\r\n\"Should we drive?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we can make it across,\" he said. Traffic was light, though\r\nthe cars that bombed past were doing 90 or more. He started to gather\r\nup a few more of his people, but reconsidered. It was a little scary\r\nto be going into the town, but he couldn't afford to freak out Lester\r\nby showing up with an entourage.\r\n\r\nThe guardrail shielding the town had been bent down and flattened and\r\nthe chair wheeled over it easily, with hardly a bump. As they crossed\r\nthis border, they crossed over to another world. There were cooking\r\nsmells -- barbecue and Cuban spices -- and a little hint of septic\r\ntank or compost heap. The buildings didn't make any sense to Death's\r\neye, they curved or sloped or twisted or leaned and seemed to be made\r\nof equal parts pre-fab cement and aluminum and scrap lumber, laundry\r\nlines, power lines, and graffiti.\r\n\r\nDeath was used to drawing stares, even before he became a cyborg with\r\na beautiful woman beside him, but this was different. There were eyes\r\neverywhere. Little kids playing in the street -- hadn't these people\r\nheard of stranger danger -- stopped to stare at him with big\r\nshoe-button eyes. Faces peered out of windows from the ground on up to\r\nthe third storey. Voices whispered and called.\r\n\r\nLacey gave them her sunniest smile and even waved at the little kids,\r\nand Death tried nodding at some of the homeys staring at him from the\r\nwindow of what looked like a little diner.\r\n\r\nDeath hadn't known what to expect from this little town, but he\r\ncertainly hadn't pictured so many little shops. He realized that he\r\nthought of shops as being somehow civilized -- tax paying,\r\nlicense-bearing entities with commercial relationships with suppliers,\r\nwith cash-registers and employees. Not lawless and wild.\r\n\r\nBut every ground-floor seemed to have at least a small shop,\r\nadvertised with bright OLED pixel-boards that showed rotating\r\nenticements -- *Productos de Dominica, Beautiful for Ladies,\r\nOFERTA!!!, Fantasy Nails*. He passed twenty different shops in as many\r\nsteps, some of them seemingly nothing more than a counter recessed\r\ninto the wall with a young man sitting behind it, grinning at them.\r\n\r\nLacey stopped at one and bought them cans of coffee and small Mexican\r\npastries dusted with cinnamon. He watched a hundred pairs of eyes\r\nwatch Lacey as she drew out her purse and paid. At first he thought of\r\nthe danger, but then he realized that if anyone was to mug them, it\r\nwould be in full sight of all these people.\r\n\r\nIt was a funny thought. He'd grown up in sparse suburbs where you'd\r\nnever see anyone walking or standing on the sidewalks or their\r\nporches. Even though it was a \"nice\" neighborhood, there were muggings\r\nand even killings at regular, horrific intervals. Walking there felt\r\nlike taking your life into your hands.\r\n\r\nHere, in this crowded place with a human density like a Disney park,\r\nit felt somehow safer. Weird.\r\n\r\nThey came to what had to be the Cesar Chavez mural -- a Mexican in a\r\ncowboy hat standing like a preacher on the tailgate of a truck,\r\nsurrounded by more Mexicans, farmer-types in cotton shirts and\r\nblue-jeans and cowboy hats. They turned left and rounded a corner into\r\na little cul-de-sac with a confusion of hopscotches chalked onto the\r\nground, ringed by parked bicycles and scooters. Lester stood among\r\nthem, eating a churro in a piece of wax-paper.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be recovering quickly,\" he said, sizing up Death in his\r\nchair. \"Good to see it.\" He seemed a little distant, which Death\r\nchalked up to being interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"It's great to see you again,\" Death said. \"My friends and I have been\r\ncoming by the ride every day, helping out however we can, but we never\r\nsee you there, so I thought I'd call you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd call me.\"\r\n\r\n\"To see if we could help,\" Death said. \"With whatever you're doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" Lester said. He gestured behind him and Death noticed for\r\nthe first time the small sign that said *HOTEL ROTHSCHILD,* with a\r\nstately peacock behind it.\r\n\r\nThe door was a little narrow for his rolling chair, but he managed to\r\nget it in with a little back-and-forth, but once inside, he was\r\nstymied by the narrow staircase leading up to the upper floors. The\r\nlobby -- such as it was -- was completely filled by him, Lacey and\r\nLester, and even if the chair could have squeezed up the stairs, it\r\ncouldn't have cornered to get there.\r\n\r\nLester looked embarrassed. \"Sorry, I didn't think of that. Um. OK, I\r\ncould rig a winch and hoist the chair up if you want. We'd have to\r\nbelt you in, but it's do-able. There are masts for pulleys on the top\r\nfloor -- it's how they get the beds into the upper stories.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can get up on canes,\" Death Waits said. \"Is it safe to leave my\r\nchair outside, though?\"\r\n\r\nLester's eyebrows went up. \"Well of course -- sure it is.\" Death felt\r\nweird for having asked. He backed the chair out and locked the\r\ntransmission, feeling silly. Who was going to hot-wire a wheelchair?\r\nHe was such a dork. Lacey handed him his canes and he stood\r\ngingerly. He'd been making his way to the bathroom and back on canes\r\nall week, but he hadn't tried stairs yet. He hoped Lester wasn't too\r\nmany floors up.\r\n\r\nLester turned out to be on the third floor, and by the time they\r\nreached it, Death Waits was dripping sweat and his eyeliner had run\r\ninto his eyes. Lacey dabbed at him with her gauzy scarf and fussed\r\nover him. Death caught Lester looking at the two of them with a little\r\nsmirk, so he pushed Lacey away and steadied his breathing with an\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" he said. \"All done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great,\" Lester said. \"This is what I'm working on. You talked to\r\nPerry about it before, right? The Disney-in-a-Box printers. Well, I've\r\ncracked it. We can load our own firmware onto it -- just stick it on a\r\nnetwork with a PC, and the PC will find it and update it. Then it\r\nbecomes an open box -- it'll accept anyone's goop. You can send it\r\nyour own plans.\"\r\n\r\nDeath hadn't seen a DiaB in person yet. Beholding it and knowing that\r\nhe was the reason that Lester and Perry were experimenting with it in\r\nthe first place made him feel a sense of excitement he hadn't felt\r\nsince the goth rehab of Fantasyland began.\r\n\r\n\"So how does this tie in to the ride?\" Death asked. \"I was thinking of\r\nbuilding rides in miniature, but at that scale, will it really impress\r\npeople? No, I don't think so.\r\n\r\n\"So instead I was thinking that we could just push out details from\r\nthe ride, little tabletop-sized miniatures showing a piece every\r\nday. Maybe whatever was newest. And you could have multiple feeds, you\r\nknow, like an experimental trunk for objects that people in one region\r\nliked --\"\r\n\r\nLester was shaking his head and holding up his hands. \"Woah, wait a\r\nsecond. No, no, no --\" Death was used to having his friends hang on\r\nhis every word when he was talking about ideas for the ride and the\r\nstory, so this brought him up short. He reminded himself who he was\r\ntalking to.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry,\" he said. \"Got ahead of myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" Lester said, prodding at the printer. \"This thing is its own\r\nthing. We're about more than the ride here. I know you really like it,\r\nand that's very cool, but there's no way that everything I do from now\r\non is going to be about that fucking thing. It was a lark, it's cool,\r\nit's got its own momentum. But these boxes are going to be their own\r\nthing. I want to show people how to take control of the stuff in their\r\nliving rooms, not advertise my little commercial project to them.\"\r\n\r\nDeath couldn't make sense out of this. It sounded like Lester didn't\r\n*like* the ride. How was that possible? \"I don't get it,\" he said at\r\nlast. Lester was making him look like an idiot in front of Lacey,\r\ntoo. He didn't like how this was going at all.\r\n\r\nLester picked up a screwdriver. \"You see this? It's a tool. You can\r\npick it up and you can unscrew stuff or screw stuff in. You can use\r\nthe handle for a hammer. You can use the blade to open paint cans. You\r\ncan throw it away, loan it out, or paint it purple and frame it.\" He\r\nthumped the printer. \"This thing is a tool, too, but it's not *your*\r\ntool. It belongs to someone else -- Disney. It isn't interested in\r\nlistening to you or obeying you. It doesn't want to give you more\r\ncontrol over your life.\r\n\r\n\"This thing reminds me of life before fatkins. It was my very own\r\npersonal body, but it wasn't under my control. What's the word the\r\nacademics use? 'Agency.' I didn't have any agency. It didn't matter\r\nwhat I did, I was just this fat thing that my brain had to lug around\r\nbehind it, listening to its never-ending complaints and aches and\r\npains.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't control your life, you're miserable. Think of the people\r\nwho don't get to run their own lives: prisoners, reform-school kids,\r\nmental patients. There's something inherently awful about living like\r\nthat. Autonomy makes us happy.\"\r\n\r\nHe thumped the top of the printer again. \"So here's this stupid thing,\r\nwhich Disney gives you for free. It looks like a tool, like a thing\r\nthat you use to better your life, but in reality, it's a tool that\r\nDisney uses to control your life. You can't program it. You can't\r\nchange the channel. It doesn't even have an *off switch*. That's what\r\ngets me exercised. I want to redesign this thing so it gets converted\r\nfrom something that controls to something that gives you control.\"\r\n\r\nLester's eyes shone. Death hurt from head to toe, from the climb and\r\nthe aftermath of the beating, and the life he'd lived. Lester was\r\ntelling him that the ride wasn't important to him anymore, that he'd\r\nbe doing this other thing with the printer next, and then something\r\nelse, and then something else. He felt a great, unexpected upwelling\r\nof bitterness at the thought.\r\n\r\n\"So what about the ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"The ride? I told you. I'm done with it. It's time to do the next\r\nthing. You said you wanted to help out, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"With the ride,\" Death said patiently, with the manner of someone\r\ntalking to a child.\r\n\r\nLester turned his back on Death.\r\n\r\n\"I'm done with the ride,\" Lester said. \"I don't want to waste your\r\ntime.\" It was clear he meant, *You're wasting my time.* He bent over\r\nthe printer.\r\n\r\nLacey looked daggers at his shoulders, then turned to help Death down\r\nthe stairs. His canes clattered on the narrow staircase, and it was\r\nall he could do to keep from crying.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSuzanne rode the bullet-train from Miami airport in air-conditioned\r\namusement, watching the Mickey-shaped hang-straps rock back and\r\nforth. She'd bought herself a Mickey waffle and a bucket-sized Diet\r\nCoke in the dining car and fended off the offers of plush animatronic\r\ntoys that were clearly descended from Boogie-Woogie Elmo.\r\n\r\nNow she watched the kids tear ass up and down the train, or sit\r\nmesmerized by the videos and interactives set up at the ends of the\r\ncars. The train was really slick, and judging from the brochure she\r\nfound in the seat-pocket, there was another one from the Orlando\r\nairport. These things were like chutes leading from the luggage\r\ncarousel straight into the parks. Disney had figured out how to make\r\nsure that every penny spent by its tourists went straight into its\r\ncoffers.\r\n\r\nThe voice-over announcements as they pulled into the station were in\r\nEnglish, Chinese, Spanish, Farsi and Russian -- in that order -- and\r\ndisplayed on the porters' red coats with brass buttons were\r\nname-badges with the flags of many nations, denoting the languages\r\nthey spoke. They wore mouse-ears, and Suzanne -- a veteran of\r\ninnumerable hotels -- could not dissuade one from taking her suitcase.\r\n\r\nHe brought her to a coach-station and saw her aboard a bus marked for\r\nthe Polynesian, decorated with tiki-lamps, bamboo, and palm-fronds\r\n(she touched one and discovered that it was vinyl). He refused her tip\r\nas they saw her aboard, and then stood and waved her off with his\r\nwhite gloves and giant white smile. She had to chuckle as she pulled\r\naway, amazed at how effective these little touches were. She felt her\r\nmuscles loosening, little involuntary chuckles rising in her\r\nthroat. The coach was full of parents and children from all over the\r\nworld, grinning and laughing and hugging and talking excitedly about\r\nthe day ahead of them.\r\n\r\nThe coach let them off to a group of Hawai'ian-shirt-clad staff who\r\nshouted \"Aloha!\" at them as they debarked, and picked up their luggage\r\nwith swift, cheerful, relentless efficiency. Her check-in was so\r\npainless she wasn't sure it was over until a nice young lady who\r\nlooked Chechen picked up her bag for her and urged her out to the\r\ngrounds, which were green and lush, like nothing she'd seen since\r\nlanding in Florida. She was surrounded by the hotel structures,\r\nlong-houses decorated with Polynesian masks and stalked by leggy\r\nibises and chirping tropical birds. Before her was a white-sand beach\r\nfronting onto an artificial lake ringed with other luxury hotels: a\r\ngigantic 1970s Soviet A-frame building and a gingerbread-choked\r\nVictorian hotel. The lake was ringed with a monorail track and plied\r\nby handsome paddle-wheeler ferry-boats.\r\n\r\nShe stared gape-jawed at this until the bellhop gently tugged at her\r\nelbow, giving her a dazzling smile.\r\n\r\nHer room was the kind of thing you'd see Lucy and Ricky checking into\r\non honeymoon in an old *I Love Lucy* episode -- wicker ceiling fans,\r\nbamboo furniture, a huge hot-tub shaped like a seashell. Outside, a\r\nlittle terrace looking over the lake, with a pair of cockatoos looking\r\nquizzically at her. The bellhop waved at them and they cawed at her\r\nand flew off. Suzanne must have made a disappointed noise, because the\r\nbellhop patted her on the arm and said, \"Don't worry, we feed them\r\nhere, they come back all the time. Greedy birdies!\"\r\n\r\nShe tipped the bellhop five bucks once she'd been given the grand tour\r\nof the room -- a tame Internet connection that was \"kid-friendly\" and\r\na likewise censored video-on-demand service, delivery pizza or sushi,\r\ninformation on park hours, including the dazzling array of extras she\r\ncould purchase. It turned out that resort guests were eligible to\r\npurchase priority passes for boarding rides ahead of the plebes, and\r\nfor entering parks early and staying late. This made Suzanne feel\r\nright at home -- it was very Russian in its approach: the more you\r\nspent, the better your time was.\r\n\r\nShe bought it all: all the fast-passes and priority cards, all of it\r\nloaded into a grinning Mickey on a lanyard, a wireless pendant that\r\nwould take care of her everywhere she went in the park, letting her\r\nspend money like water.\r\n\r\nThus girded, she consulted with her bellhop some more and laid out an\r\nitinerary. Once she'd showered she found she didn't want to wear any\r\nof her European tailored shorts and blouses. She wanted to disappear\r\ninto the Great American Mass. The hotel gift shop provided her with a\r\nbarkcloth Hawai'ian shirt decorated with tessellated Disney trademarks\r\nand a big pair of loose shorts, and once she donned them, she saw that\r\nshe could be anyone now, any tourist in the park. A pair of cheap\r\nsunglasses completed the look and she paid for it all by waving her\r\nMickey necklace at the register, spending money like water.\r\n\r\nShe passed the rest of the day at the Magic Kingdom, taking a ferry\r\nfrom the hotel's pier to the Victorian wrought-iron docks on the other\r\nside of the little artificial lake. As she cleared the turnstiles into\r\nMain Street, USA, her heart quickened. Kids rushed past her, chased by\r\ntheir parents' laughing calls to slow down. Balloon sellers and\r\nold-fashioned popcorn machines jostled for space in the crowd, and a\r\nbrass band was marching down the street in straw boaters and red\r\nstriped jackets, playing a Sousa march.\r\n\r\nShe ambled up the road, peering in the adorable little shop windows,\r\nlike the shops in a fancy casino, all themed artificial facades that\r\nwere, in back, all one shop, linked through the length of the street.\r\n\r\nShe reached the castle before she realized it, and saw that it was\r\nshorter than it had appeared. Turning around and looking back down\r\nMain Street, she saw that the trees lining the sides of the street had\r\nbeen trimmed so they got progressively smaller from the gates to the\r\ncastle, creating a kind of false perspective line. She laughed now,\r\namused by the accomplishment of the little trompe l'oeil.\r\n\r\nShe squeezed past the hordes of Asian tourists taking precisely the\r\nsame picture of the castle, one after another, a phenomenon she'd\r\nobserved at other famous landmarks. For some Japanese shutterbugs, the\r\nholiday photo experience was as formal as the Stations of the Cross,\r\nwith each picture of each landmark rigidly prescribed by custom and\r\nunwritten law.\r\n\r\nNow she was under the castle and headed for what her map assured her\r\nwas Fantasyland. Just as she cleared the archway, she remembered her\r\nconversations with that Death Waits kid about Fantasyland: this was\r\nthe part that had been made over as a goth area, and then remade as\r\nthe Happiest Construction Site on Earth.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was. The contrast was stark. From fairy castle to\r\ngreen-painted construction sidings. From smiling, well-turned out\r\n\"castmembers\" to construction workers with butt-crack-itis and grouchy\r\nexpressions. Fantasyland was like an ugly scar on the blemish-free\r\nface of a Barbie doll.\r\n\r\nShe liked it.\r\n\r\nSomething about all that artifice, all that cunning work to cover up\r\nall the bodies a company like Disney would have buried under its\r\nmanicured Main Street -- it had given her a low-level, tooth-grinding\r\nheadache, a kind of anger at the falseness of it all. Here, she could\r\nsee the bodies as they buried them.\r\n\r\nOut came her camera and she went on the prowl, photographing and\r\nphotographing, seeking high ground from which to catch snaps over the\r\nsiding. She'd look at the satellite pics of this spot later.\r\n\r\nNow she knew what her next project would be: she would document this\r\nscar. She'd dig up the bodies.\r\n\r\nJust for completeness' sake, she went on some of the rides. Her\r\nsuper-fancy pass let her sail past the long lines of bored kids, angry\r\ndads, exhausted moms. She captured their expressions with her camera.\r\n\r\nThe rides were all right. She was sick of rides, truth be told. As an\r\nart-form, they were wildly overrated. Some of them made her sick and\r\nsome of them were like mildly interesting trips through someone's\r\ncollection of action-figures in a dark room. The Disney rides didn't\r\neven let you drive, like Lester's ride did, and you didn't get to vote\r\non them.\r\n\r\nBy the time the sun had gone down, she was ready to go back to the\r\nroom and start writing. She wanted to get all this down, the beauty\r\nand the terror, the commerce lurking underneath the friendly\r\nfacade. As the day lengthened into night, there were more and more\r\nscreaming children, more angry parents. She caught parents smacking\r\nkids, once, twice, got her camera out, caught three more.\r\n\r\nThey sent a big pupu platter up to her room with a dish of poi and a\r\nhollow pineapple filled with rum. She took her computer out onto her\r\nlanai and looked out over the lake. An ibis came by and demanded some\r\nof her dinner scraps. She obliged it and it gave her a cold look, as\r\nif determining whether she'd be good for dessert, then flew off.\r\n\r\nShe began to write.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSomething had changed between Kettlewell and Eva since they'd left\r\nFlorida with the kids. It wasn't just the legal hassles, though there\r\nwere plenty of those. They'd gone to Florida with a second chance -- a\r\nchance for him to be a mover again, a chance for her to have a husband\r\nwho was happy with his life again.\r\n\r\nNow he found himself sneaking past her when she was in the living room\r\nand they slept back to back in bed with as much room between them as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAda missed Lyenitchka and spent all her time in her bedroom IMing her\r\nfriend or going questing with her in their favorite game, which\r\ninvolved Barbies, balrogs, and buying outfits. Pascal missed all the\r\nattention he had received as the designated mascot of the two little\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nIt was not a high point in the history of the Kettlewell clan.\r\n\r\n\"Hello?\"\r\n\r\n\"Landon Kettlewell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Freddy,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"My fame precedes me,\" the journalist said. Kettlewell could hear the\r\ngrin in his voice. That voice was unmistakable -- Kettlewell had heard\r\nit in the occassional harassing voicemail that Suzanne forwarded on.\r\n\r\n\"How are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm very well sir, and kind of you to ask, yes indeed. I hear\r\nyou're not doing so well, though?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't complain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would, though.\" You could tell, Freddy thought he was a\r\nfunny son of a bitch. \"Seriously, Mr Kettlewell. I'm calling to follow\r\nup on the story of the litigation that Perry Gibbons and Lester Banks\r\nare facing for unilaterally canceling the arrangement you'd made to\r\nfinance their litigation. I'm hoping that you'll give me a quote that\r\nmight put this into perspective. Is the defense off? Will Gibbons and\r\nBanks be sued? Are you a party to the suit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Freddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr Kettlewell.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not a child, nor am I a fool, nor am I a sucker. I'm also not a\r\nhothead. You can't goad me into saying something. You can't trick me\r\ninto saying something. I haven't hung up on you yet, but I will unless\r\nyou can give me a single good reason to believe that any good could\r\npossibly come out of talking to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to write this story and publish it today. I can either\r\nwrite that you declined to comment or I can write down whatever\r\ncomment you might have on the matter. You tell me which is fairer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodbye, Freddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, wait! Just wait.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell liked the pleading note in Freddy's voice.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Freddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I get you to comment on the general idea of litigation\r\ninvestment? A lot of people followed your lead in seeking out\r\nlitigation investment opportunities. There's lots of money tied up in\r\nit these days. Do incidents like the one in Florida mean that\r\nlitigation investment is a dead strategy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" Kettlewell snapped. He shouldn't be talking to this\r\nman, but the question drove him bonkers. He'd invented litigation\r\ninvestment. \"Those big old companies have two common characteristics:\r\nthey've accumulated more assets than they know what to do with, and\r\nthey've got poisonous, monopolistic cultures that reward executives\r\nwho break the law to help the company turn a buck. None of that's\r\nchanged, and so long as that's all true, there will be little\r\ncompanies with legit gripes against big companies that can be used as\r\ninvestment vehicles for unlocking all that dead Fortune 100 capital\r\nand putting it to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"But aren't Fortune 100 companies investing in litigation funds?\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell suppressed a nasty laugh. \"Yeah, so what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if this is about destroying Fortune 100 companies --\"\r\n\r\n\"It's about wringing positive social value out of the courts and out\r\nof investment. The way it used to work, there were only two possible\r\noutcomes when a big company did something rotten: either they'd get\r\naway scot-free or they'd make some lawyers very, very rich. Litigation\r\nfunds fix that. They socialize the cost of bringing big companies to\r\nheel, and they free up the capital that these big companies have\r\naccumulated.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when a big company invests in destroying another big company --\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes you get a forest where a few trees end up winning, they\r\nform a canopy that keeps all the sunlight from reaching the\r\nfloor. Now, this is stable for forests, but stability is the *last*\r\nthing you want in a market. Just look at what happens when one of\r\nthose big trees falls over: whoosh! A million kinds of life are\r\nspawned on the floor, fighting for the light that tree had hogged for\r\nitself. In a market, when you topple a company that's come to\r\ncomplacently control some part of the ecosystem, you free up that\r\nniche for new innovators.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why is that better than stability? Don't the workers at these\r\ncompanies deserve the security that comes from their employers'\r\nsurvival?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh come on, Freddy. Stop beating that drum. If you're an employee and\r\nyou want to get a good deal out of an employer, you're better off if\r\nyou've got fifty companies you could work for than just one.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you're saying that if you destroy Disney with your lawsuit, the\r\nfifty thousand people who work at Walt Disney World will be able to,\r\nwhat, work for those little rides like your friends have built?\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll find lots of work, Freddy. If we make it possible for anyone\r\nto open an innovative little ride without worrying about getting\r\nclobbered by a big old monopolist. You like big corporations so much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it's not little innovative startups that invest in these\r\nfunds, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's they who benefit once the fund takes up their cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how's that working out for the ride people you're meant to be\r\nhelping out? They rejected you, didn't they?\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell really hated Freddy, he realized. Not just a little -- he\r\nhad a deep and genuine loathing. \"Oh, for fuck's sake. You don't like\r\nlittle companies. You don't like big companies. You don't like\r\nworkers' co-ops. What do you want us to do, Freddy? You want us to\r\njust curl up under a rock and die? You sit there and make up your\r\nfunny names for things; you make your snarky little commentaries, but\r\nhow much good have *you* done for the world, you complaining, sniping\r\nlittle troll?\"\r\n\r\nThe line got very quiet. \"Can I quote you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly can,\" Kettlewell huffed. In for a penny, in for a\r\npound. \"You can print that, and you can kiss my ass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr Kettlewell,\" Freddy said. \"I'll certainly take the\r\nsuggestion under advisement.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell stood in his home office and stared at the four\r\nwalls. Upstairs, Pascal was crying. He did that a lot\r\nlately. Kettlewell breathed deeply and tried to chill out.\r\n\r\nSomeone was knocking at his door, though. He answered it\r\ntentatively. The kid he found there was well-scrubbed, black, in his\r\ntwenties, and smiling amiably.\r\n\r\n\"Landon Kettlewell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's suing me?\" Kettlewell could spot a process server a mile away.\r\n\r\nThe guy shrugged and made a little you-got-me smile. \"Couldn't say,\r\nsir,\" he said, and handed Kettlewell the envelope, holding it so that\r\nthe header was clearly visible to the camera set into the lapel of his\r\nshirt.\r\n\r\n\"You want me to sign something?\" Kettlewell said.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, sir,\" the kid said and pointed at the camera. \"It's\r\nall caught on video.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, right,\" Kettlewell said. \"Want a cup of water? Coffee?\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect you're going to be too busy to entertain, sir,\" the kid\r\nsaid, and ticked a little salute off his forehead. \"But you seem like\r\na nice guy. Good luck with it all.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell watched him go, then closed the door and walked back to his\r\noffice, opening the envelope and scanning it. No surprises there --\r\nthe shareholders in the investment syndicate that had backed Lester\r\nand Perry were suing him for making false representations about his\r\nability to speak for them.\r\n\r\nTjan called him a minute later.\r\n\r\n\"They got you too, huh?\" Kettlewell said.\r\n\r\n\"Just left. Wish I could say it was unexpected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wish I could say I blamed them,\" Kettlewell said.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, you should see what the ride's been doing this week since\r\nFlorida went down,\" Tjan said. \"It's totally mutated. I think it's\r\nmostly coming from the Midwest, though those Brazilians seem to keep\r\non logging in somehow too.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many rides are there in South America, anyways?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brazilians of them!\" Tjan said with a mirthless chuckle. \"Impossible\r\nto say. They've got some kind of variant on the protocol that lets a\r\nbunch of them share one network address. I think some of them aren't\r\neven physical rides, just virtual flythroughs. Some are directly\r\nlinked, some do a kind of mash-up between their current norms and\r\nother rides' current norms. It's pretty weird.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell paced. \"Well, at least someone's having a good time.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're going to nail us to the wall,\" Tjan said. \"Both of\r\nus. Probably the individual ride-operators, too. They're out for\r\nblood.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not like they even lost much money.\"\r\n\r\n\"They didn't need to -- they feel like they lost the money they might\r\nhave won from Disney.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that was twenty years away, and highly speculative.\"\r\n\r\nTjan sighed heavily on the other end of the phone. \"Landon, you're a\r\nvery, very good finance person. The best I've ever met, but you really\r\nneed to understand that even the most speculative investor is mostly\r\nspeculating about how he's going to spend all the money you're about\r\nto make him. If investors didn't count their chickens before they\r\nhatched, you'd never raise a cent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Kettlewell said. He knew it, but he couldn't soak it in. He'd\r\nwon and lost so many fortunes -- his own and others' -- that he'd\r\nlearned to take it all in stride. Not everyone else was so sanguine.\r\n\r\n\"So what do we do about it? I don't much want to lose everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could always go back to Russia,\" Kettlewell said, suddenly\r\nfeeling short-tempered. Why did he always have to come up with the\r\nplan? \"Sorry. You know what the lawyers are going to tell us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. Sue Perry and Lester.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we told Lester we wouldn't do that. It was probably a mistake to\r\ndo this at all, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, don't say that. The idea was a really good one. You might have\r\nsaved their asses if they'd played along.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I'd kept the lawyers on a shorter leash.\"\r\n\r\nThey both sat in glum silence.\r\n\r\n\"How about if we defend ourselves by producing evidence that they\r\nreneged on a deal we'd made in good faith. Then the bastards can sue\r\nPerry and Lester and we'll still be keeping our promise.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell tried to picture Perry in a courtroom. He'd never been the\r\nmost even-keeled dude and since he'd been shot and had his arm broken\r\nand been gassed, he was almost pathological.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a better idea,\" he said, growing excited as it unfolded in\r\nhis mind. He had that burning sensation he got sometimes when he knew\r\nhe was having a real doozy. \"How about if we approach each of the\r\nindividual ride co-ops and see if they'll join the lawsuit separately\r\nfrom the umbrella org? Play it right and we'll have the lawsuit back\r\non, without having to get our asses handed to us and without having to\r\ndestroy Perry and Lester!\"\r\n\r\nTjan laughed. \"That's -- that's... Wow! Genius. Yeah, OK, right! The\r\nBoston group is in, I'll tell you that much. I'm sure we can get half\r\na dozen more in, too. Especially if we can get Perry to agree not to\r\nblock it, which I'm sure he'll do after I have a little talk with\r\nhim. This'll work!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes the threat of total legal destruction can have a wonderful,\r\nclarifying effect on one's mind,\" Kettlewell said drily. \"How're the\r\nkids?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lyenitchka is in a sulk. She wants to go back to Florida and she\r\nwants to see Ada some more. Plus she's upset that we never made it to\r\nDisney World.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell flopped down on his couch. \"Have you seen Suzanne's blog\r\nlately?\"\r\n\r\nTjan laughed. \"Yeah. Man, she's giving it to them with both\r\nbarrels. Makes me feel sorry for 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Um, you *do* know that we're suing them for everything they've got,\r\nright?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes. But that's just money. Suzanne's going to take their\r\nballs.\"\r\n\r\nThey exchanged some more niceties and promised that they'd get\r\ntogether face-to-face real soon and Kettlewell hung up. From behind\r\nhim, he heard someone fidgeting.\r\n\r\n\"Kids, you know you aren't supposed to come into my office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like things have gotten started up again.\" It wasn't the kids,\r\nit was Eva. He sat up. She was standing with her arms folded in the\r\ndoorway of his office, staring at him.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said, mumbling a little. She was really beautiful, his\r\nwife, and she put up with a hell of a lot. He felt obscurely ashamed\r\nof the way that he'd treated her. He wished he could stand up and give\r\nher a warm hug. He couldn't.\r\n\r\nInstead, she sat beside him. \"Sounds like you'll be busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I just need to get all the individual co-ops on board, talk to\r\nthe lawyers, get the investors off my back. Have a shareholders'\r\nmeeting. It'll be fine.\"\r\n\r\nHer smile was little and sad. \"I'm going, Landon,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe blood drained from his face. She'd left him plenty, over the\r\nyears. He'd deserved it. But it had always been white-hot, in the\r\nmiddle of a fight, and it had always ended with some kind of\r\nreconciliation. This time, it had the feeling of something planned and\r\nexecuted in cold blood.\r\n\r\nHe sat up and folded his hands in his lap. He didn't know what else to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nHer smile wilted. \"It's not going to work, you and me. I can't live\r\nlike this, lurching from crisis to crisis. I love you too much to\r\nwatch that happen. I hate what it turns me into. You're only happy\r\nwhen you're miserable, you know that? I can't do that forever. We'll\r\nbe part of each others' lives forever, but I can't be Mrs Stressbunny\r\nforever.\"\r\n\r\nNone of this was new. She'd shouted variations on this at him at many\r\ntimes in their relationship. The difference was that now she wasn't\r\nshouting. She was calm, assured, sad but not crying. Behind her in the\r\nhallway, he saw that she'd packed her suitcase, and the little\r\nsuitcases the kids used when they travelled together.\r\n\r\n\"Where will you go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to stay with Lucy, from college. She's living down the\r\npeninsula in Mountain View. She's got room for the kids.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt like raging at her, promising her a bitter divorce and custody\r\nsuit, but he couldn't do it. She was completely right, after all. Even\r\nthough his first impulse was to argue, he couldn't do it just then.\r\n\r\nSo she left, and Kettlewell was alone in his nice apartment with his\r\nphone and his computer and his lawsuits and his mind fizzing with\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe last thing Sammy wanted was a fight. Dinah's promo was making\r\nmajor bank for the company -- and he was taking more and more meetings\r\nin Texas with Dinah, which was a hell of a perk. They'd shipped two\r\nmillion of the DiaBs, and were projecting ten million in the first\r\nquarter. Park admission was soaring and the revenue from the\r\nadvertising was going to cover the entire cost of the next rev of the\r\nDiaBs, which would be better, faster, smaller and cheaper.\r\n\r\nThat business with Death Waits and the new Fantasyland and the ride --\r\nwhat did it matter now? He'd been so focused on the details that he'd\r\nlost track of the big picture. Walt Disney had made his empire by\r\nfiguring out how to do the next thing, not wasting his energy on how\r\nto protect the last thing. It had all been a mistake, a dumb mistake,\r\nand now he was back on track. From all appearances, the lawsuits were\r\non the verge of blowing away, anyway. Fantasyland -- he'd turned that\r\nover to Wiener, of all people, and he was actually doing some good\r\nstuff there. Really running with the idea of restoring it as a\r\nnostalgia site aimed squarely at fatkins, with lots of food and\r\nromantic kiddie rides that no kid would want to ride in the age of the\r\nbreak-neck coaster.\r\n\r\nThe last thing he wanted was a fight. What he wanted was to make\r\nassloads of money for the company, remake himself as a power in the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nBut he was about to have a fight.\r\n\r\nHackelberg came into his office unannounced. Sammy had some of the\r\nImagineers in, showing him prototypes of the next model, which was\r\nbeing designed for more reliable shipping and easier\r\npacking. Hackelberg was carrying his cane today, wearing his ice-cream\r\nsuit, and was flushed a deep, angry red that seemed to boil up from\r\nhis collar.\r\n\r\nOne look from his blazing eyes was enough to send the Imagineers\r\nscurrying. They didn't even take their prototype with them. Hackelberg\r\nclosed the door behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Samuel,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Nice to see you. Can I offer you a glass of water? Iced tea?\"\r\n\r\nHackelberg waved the offers away. \"They're using your boxes to print\r\ntheir own designs,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those freaks with their home-made ride. They've just published a\r\nsystem for printing their own objects on your boxes.\"\r\n\r\nSammy rewound the conversations he'd had with the infosec people in\r\nImagineering about what countermeasures they'd come up with, what they\r\nwere proof against. He was pissed that he was finding out about this\r\nfrom Hackelberg. If Lester and Perry were hacking the DiaBs, they\r\nwould be talking about it nonstop, running their mouths on the\r\nInternet. Back when he was his own competitive intelligence\r\nspecialist, he would have known about this project the second it\r\nbegan. Now he was trying to find a competitive intelligence person who\r\nknew his ass from his elbow, so far without success.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's regrettable, obviously, but so long as we're still\r\nselling the consumables...\" The goop was a huge profit-maker for the\r\ncompany. They bought it in bulk, added a proprietary, precisely mixed\r\nchemical that the printer could check for in its hoppers, and sold it\r\nto the DiaB users for a two thousand percent markup. If you tried to\r\nsubstitute a competitor's goop, the machine would reject it. They\r\nshipped out new DiaBs with only half a load of goop, so that the first\r\npurchase would come fast. It was making more money, week-on-week, than\r\npopcorn.\r\n\r\n\"The crack they're distributing also disables the checking for the\r\nwatermark. You can use any generic goop in them.\"\r\n\r\nSammy shook his head and restrained himself from thumping his hand\r\ndown on the desk. He wanted to scream.\r\n\r\n\"We're not suing them, are we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that's wise, Samuel?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm no legal expert. You tell me. Maybe we can take stronger\r\ncountermeasures with the next generation --\" He gestured at the\r\nprototype on his desk.\r\n\r\n\"And abandon the two million units we've shipped to date?\"\r\n\r\nSammy thought about it. Those families might hang on to their original\r\ntwo million forever, or until they wore out. Maybe he should be\r\nbuilding them to fall apart after six months of use, to force updates.\r\n\r\n\"It's just so unfair. They're ripping us off. We spent the money on\r\nthose units so that we could send our message out. What the hell is\r\nwrong with those people? Are they compulsive? Do they *have* to\r\ndestroy every money-making business?\"\r\n\r\nHackelberg sat back. \"Samuel, I think it's time we dealt with them.\"\r\n\r\nSammy's mind was still off on the strategies for keeping Lester and\r\nPerry at bay, though. Sure, a six-month obsolescence curve would do\r\nit. Or they could just charge money for the DiaBs now that people were\r\nstarting to understand what they were for. Hell, they could just make\r\nthe most compelling stuff for a DiaB to print and maybe that would be\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nHackelberg tapped the tip of his cane once, sharply. Sammy came back\r\nto the conversation. \"So that's settled. Filing suit today. We're\r\ngoing to do a discovery on them that'll split them open from asshole\r\nto throat. No more of this chickenshit police stuff -- we're going to\r\nfigure out every source of income these bastards have, we're going to\r\ntake away their computers, we're going down to their ISPs and getting\r\ntheir emails and instant messages.\r\n\r\n\"And as we've seen, they're going to retaliate. That's fine. We're not\r\ntreating these people as a couple of punk pirates who go down at the\r\nfirst sign of trouble. Not anymore. We know that these people are the\r\ncompetition. We're going to make an example of them. They're the first\r\nones to attack on this front, but they won't be the last. We're\r\nvulnerable, Samuel, but we can contain that vulnerability with enough\r\ndeterrent.\"\r\n\r\nHackelberg seemed to be expecting something of Sammy, but Sammy was\r\ndamned if he knew what it was. \"OK,\" he said lamely.\r\n\r\nHackelberg's smile was like a jack o'lantern's. \"That means that we've\r\ngot to be prepared for their discovery on *us*. I need to know every\r\nsingle detail of this DiaB project, including the things I'd find if I\r\nwent through your phone records and your email. Because they *will* be\r\ngoing through them. They'll be putting you and your operation under\r\nthe microscope.\"\r\n\r\nSammy restrained his groan. \"I'll have it for you,\" he said. \"Give me\r\na day or two.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw Hackelberg out of his office as quickly as he could, then shut\r\nthe door. Hackelberg wanted everything, and that meant *everything*,\r\nincluding his playmates from the advertising industry --\r\neverything. He was becoming the kind of executive who emitted\r\nstrategic intelligence, rather than the kind who gathered it. That\r\nwouldn't do. That wasn't the natural order of things.\r\n\r\nHe sat down at his computer. Someone had to do the competitive\r\nintelligence work around here and it looked like it would have to be\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nWhat the World Can Learn from Disney\r\n\r\nSuzanne Church\r\n\r\nIt's easy to dismiss Disney. They make more lawsuits than rides these\r\ndays.  They have a reputation for Polyannaish chirpiness. Their\r\ncorporate communications veer from Corporate Passive Voice Third\r\nPerson to a syrupy, condescending kiddee-speak that's calculated to\r\ndrive children into a frenzy of parent-nagging screeches.\r\n\r\nBut if you haven't been to a Disney Park in a while, you don't know\r\nwhat you're missing. I've been in Walt Disney World for a week now,\r\nand I'm here to tell you, it's pretty good. No, it's better than that\r\n-- it's *amazing*.\r\n\r\nYou've probably heard about the attention to detail: the roofline over\r\nFantasyland features sagging, Georgian tiles, crazy chimneys, and\r\nsubtly animated gargoyles (left over from a previous, goth-ier\r\nincarnation of this part of the park). You don't see this unless you\r\nraise your eyes above the busy, intriguing facades that front the\r\nrides, above the masterfully painted signage, and higher still. In\r\nother words, unless you're someone like me, looking for details, you\r\nwon't spot them. They're there as pure gold-plating, they're there\r\nbecause someone who took pride in his work *put them there*.\r\n\r\nIt tells you something about the people behind the scenes here. People\r\nwho care about their jobs work here. It's easy to forget that when\r\nyou're thinking about Disney, a company whose reputation these days\r\nhas more to do with whom they sue than with what they make.\r\n\r\nBut oh, what they make. There's a safari park here, something like a\r\nzoo but without that stuff that makes you feel like you're\r\nparticipating in some terrible exercise that strips noble animals of\r\ntheir dignity for our amusement. Instead, the animals here roam free,\r\nnear their hairless monkey cousins, separated from them by water\r\nfeatures, camouflaged ditches, simulated ancient ruins [more details].\r\n\r\nThat's just one of six parks, each subdivided into six or seven\r\n\"lands,\" each land with its own unique charm, culture, and\r\ncustoms. That's not counting the outlying areas: two new towns, golf\r\ncourses, a velodrome, a preserved marshland that you can tour in a\r\nskiff with a local naturist. In these days of cheap fabrication, it's\r\neasy to forget what you can do with several billion dollars and the\r\nkind of hubris that leads you to dredge lakes, erect papier mache\r\nmountains, and create your own toy mass-transit system.\r\n\r\nOf course, Disney Parks are no strangers to small scale\r\nfabrication. See their tiny, clever Disney-in-a-Box devices, which I\r\nhave chronicled here from the other side. On the one hand, these\r\nthings are networked volumetric printers, but on the other, they are\r\nsuperb category-busters that have achieved an entirely justifiable --\r\nyet still staggering -- market penetration in just a few months.\r\n\r\nI came here ready to be bored and disgusted and fleeced of every\r\nnickel. I am disappointed. The parks are tremendous at separating\r\npeople from money, it's true. They've structured each promenade and\r\nstroll so that even a walk to the bathroom can create a\r\nMommy-Daddy-Want-It-NOW situation. For such a happy place, there\r\ncertainly are a lot of weepy children and frustrated parents.\r\n\r\nBut it's hard to fault Disney for being a business that makes a lot of\r\nmoney. That's the point, after all. And it can't be cheap to keep the\r\ntens of thousands of \"castmembers\" (yes, they really do call them\r\nthat, even when they're earning minimum wage and work jobs with all\r\nthe glamour of a bathroom attendant) hanging around, picking up litter\r\nand confronting every new \"guest\" with eerily convincing cheer.\r\n\r\nAs for \"bored\" and \"disgusted\" -- not yet. Bored -- it's impossible to\r\nimagine such a thing. For starters, the world's middle classes have\r\nconverged here in a sort of bourgeois UN, and you can get a lot of\r\npleasure out of watching a Chinese \"little emperor\" with doting\r\nparents in tow making friends with a tiny perfect Russian mafiyeh\r\nprincess whose parents flick nervously at their nicotine inhalers and\r\nscout the building facades for hidden cameras.\r\n\r\nOf course, if people-watching isn't your thing, there are the rides\r\nthemselves, which make art out of the shoebox diorama. There are\r\nluaus, indoor scuba diving with live sharks, and an island of\r\ngenuinely sleazy nightclubs where you can get propositioned for some\r\nimprobable acts that are hardly family friendly. These last appear to\r\nbe largely populated by the \"castmembers\" seeking a little after-work\r\naction.\r\n\r\nDisgusted? I think if I were a parent, there'd be parts of the\r\nexperience that drove me nuts. But once you get to know the rhythm of\r\nthe place, you start to see that there are navigable pathways that\r\ndon't lead through any commercial areas -- fantastic adventure\r\nplaygrounds, nature hikes, petting zoos, horseback rides, sports\r\ntraining. And for every kid who's having a blood-sugar meltdown after\r\nconsuming half a quart of high-fructose lube slathered on a cinnamon\r\nbun, there's another who is standing open-mouthed with complete bodily\r\nwonder, at some stupendous spectacle, clearly forming neuronal\r\nconnections of a sort that will create the permanent predisposition to\r\nan appreciation of spectacle, wonder, and beauty.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of place where you have to love the sin and hate the\r\nsinner. The company may sue and resort to dirty tricks, but it's also\r\nchock full of real artists making real art.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't been for a visit, you should. Honestly. Oh, by all\r\nmeans, also go somewhere unspoiled (if you can find it). Go\r\ncamping. Go to one of the rides I've written so much about. But if you\r\nwant to see the bright side of what billions can do -- the stuff you\r\nnever get from outside the walls of this fortress of fun -- buy a\r\nticket.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe barman at Suzanne's hotel started building her a Lapu-Lapu as she\r\ncame up the stairs. The drink involved a hollow pineapple, overproof\r\nrum, and an umbrella, and she'd concluded that it contained the\r\nperfect dosage of liquid CNS depressant to unwind her after a day of\r\nbattle at the parks. That day she'd spent following around the troupes\r\nof role-playing actors at Disney's Hollwood Studios: a cast of a\r\nhundred costumed players who acted out a series of interlocking\r\ncomedies set in the black-and-white days of Hollywood. They were\r\nfearlessly cheeky, grabbing audience members and conscripting them in\r\ntheir plays.\r\n\r\nNow she was footsore and there was still a nighttime at Epcot in her\r\nfuture. The barman passed her the pineapple and she thumped her\r\nlanyard against the bar twice -- once to pay for the drink and once to\r\ngive him a generous tip. He was gay as a goose, but fun to look at,\r\nand he flirted with her for kicks.\r\n\r\n\"Gentleman caller for you, Suzanne,\" he said, tilting his head. \"You\r\ntemptress.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked in the direction indicated and took in the man sitting on\r\nthe bar-stool. He didn't have the look of a harried dad and he was too\r\nold to be a love-flushed honeymooner. In sensible tropical-weight\r\nslacks and a western shirt, he was impossible to place. He smiled and\r\ngave her a little wave.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"He came in an hour ago and asked for you.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked back at the man. \"What's your take on him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he works here. He didn't pay with an employee card, but he\r\nacted like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" she said, \"send out a search party if I'm not back in an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go get him, tiger,\" the barman said, giving her hand a squeeze.\r\n\r\nShe carried her pineapple with her and drifted down the bar.\r\n\r\n\"Hello there,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Ms Church,\" the man said. He had a disarming, confident smile. \"My\r\nname is Sammy Page.\"\r\n\r\nShe knew the name, of course. The face, too, now that she thought\r\nabout it. He offered her his hand. She didn't take it. He put it down,\r\nthen wiped it on his trouser-leg.\r\n\r\n\"Are you having a good time?\"\r\n\r\n\"A lovely time, thank you.\" She sipped her drink and wished it was a\r\nlittle more serious and intimidating. It's hard to do frosty when\r\nyou're holding a rum-filled pineapple with a paper parasol.\r\n\r\nHis smile faltered. \"I read your article. I can't believe I missed\r\nit. I mean, you've been here for six days and I just figured it out\r\ntoday? I'm a pretty incompetent villain.\"\r\n\r\nShe let a little smile slip out at that. \"Well, it's a big Internet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I *love* your stuff. I've been reading it since, well, back when\r\nI lived in the Valley. I used to get the Merc actually delivered on\r\npaper.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a walking fossil, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\nHe bobbed his head. \"So it comes down to this. I've been very\r\ndistracted with making things besides lawsuits lately, as you\r\nknow. I've been putting my energy into doing stuff, not preventing\r\nstuff. It's been refreshing.\"\r\n\r\nShe grubbed in her pocket and came up with a little steno book and a\r\npencil. \"Do you mind if I take notes?\"\r\n\r\nHe gulped. \"Can this all be on background?\"\r\n\r\nShe hefted her notebook. \"No,\" she said finally. \"If there's anything\r\nthat needs publishing, I'm going to have to publish it. I can respect\r\nthe fact that you're speaking to me with candor, but frankly, Mr Page,\r\nyou haven't earned the privilege of speaking on background.\"\r\n\r\nHe sipped at his drink -- a more grown-up highball, with a lone\r\nice-cube in it, maybe a Scotch and soda. \"OK, right. Well, then, on\r\nthe record, but candorously. I loved your article. I love your work in\r\ngeneral. I'm really glad to have you here, because I think we make\r\ngreat stuff and we're making more of it than ever. Your latest post\r\nwas right on the money -- we care about our work here. That's how we\r\ngot to where we are.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you devote a lot of your resources to other projects here, don't\r\nyou? I've heard about you, Mr Page. I've interviewed Death Waits.\" He\r\nwinced and she scribbled a note, leaving him on tenterhooks while she\r\nwrote. Something cold and angry had hold of her writing arm. \"I've\r\ninterviewed him and heard what he has to say about this place, what\r\nyou have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"My hands aren't the cleanest,\" he said. \"But I'm trying to atone.\" He\r\nswallowed. The barman was looking at them. \"Look, can I take you for a\r\nwalk, maybe? Someplace more private?\"\r\n\r\nShe thought about it. \"Let me get changed,\" she said. \"Meet you in the\r\nlobby in ten.\"\r\n\r\nShe swapped her tennis shoes for walking sandals and put on a clean\r\nshirt and long slacks, then draped a scarf over her shoulders like a\r\nshawl. Outside, the sunset was painting the lagoon bloody. She was\r\njust about to rush back down to the lobby when she stopped and called\r\nLester, her fingers moving of their own volition.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, you,\" he said. \"Still having fun in Mauschwitz?\"\r\n\r\n\"It keeps getting weirder here, let me tell you,\" she said. She told\r\nhim about Sammy showing up, wanting to talk with her.\r\n\r\n\"Ooh, I'm jealous,\" Lester said. \"He's my arch-rival, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hadn't thought of it that way. He *is* kind of cute --\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\"\r\n\r\n\"In a slimy, sharky way. Don't worry, Lester. I miss you, you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really. I think I'm about done here. I'm going to come home soon.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause, then a snuffling sound. She realized he was\r\ncrying.  He slurped. \"Sorry. That's great, babe. I missed you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I -- I missed you too. Listen, I've got to go meet this guy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, go. Call me after dinner and tell me how it goes. Meanwhile, I'm\r\ngoing to go violate the DiaB some more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Channel it, that's right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right on.\"\r\n\r\nSammy met her in the lobby. \"I thought we could go for a walk around\r\nthe lake,\" he said. \"There's a trail that goes all the way\r\naround. It's pretty private.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at the lake. At twelve o'clock, the main gates of the Magic\r\nKingdom; at three, the retro A-frame Contemporary hotel, at nine, the\r\nwedding-cake Grand Floridian Resort.\r\n\r\n\"Lead on,\" she said. He led her out onto the artificial white-sand\r\nbeach and around, and a moment later they were on a pathway paved with\r\noctagonal tiles, each engraved with the name of a family and a year.\r\n\r\n\"I really liked your article.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said that.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked a while longer. \"It reminded me of why I came here. I\r\nworked for startups, and they were fun, but they were ephemeral. No\r\none expected something on the Web to last for half a century. Maybe\r\nthe brand survives, but who knows? I mean, who remembers Yahoo!\r\nanymore? But for sure, anything you built then would be gone in a year\r\nor two, a decade tops.\r\n\r\n\"But here...\" He waved his hands. They were coming around the bend for\r\nthe Contemporary now, and she could see it in all its absurd glory. It\r\nhad been kept up so that it looked like it might have been erected\r\nyesterday, but the towering white A-frame structure with the monorail\r\nrunning through its midriff was clearly of another era. It was like a\r\nmuseum piece, or a bit of artillery on the field at a civil war\r\nreenactment.\r\n\r\n\"I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's about the grandiosity, the permanence. The belief in doing\r\nsomething -- anything -- that will endure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't need to bring me someplace private to tell me that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't.\" He swallowed. \"It's hard because I want to tell you\r\nsomething that will compromise me if I say it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I won't let you off the hook by promising to keep it\r\nconfidential.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you're on the horns of a dilemma then, aren't you?\" The sun was\r\nnearly set now, and stones at their feet glittered from beneath,\r\nsprinkled with twinkling lights. It made the evening, scented with\r\ntropical flowers and the clean smell of the lake, even more lovely. A\r\ncool breeze fluffed her hair.\r\n\r\nHe groaned. She had to admit it, she was enjoying this. Was it any\r\nless than this man deserved?\r\n\r\n\"Let me try this again. I have some information that, if I pass it on\r\nto you, could save your friends down in Hollywood from terrible\r\nharm. I can only give you this information on the condition that you\r\ntake great pains to keep me from being identified as the source.\"\r\n\r\nThey'd come to the Magic Kingdom now. Behind them, the main gates\r\nloomed, and a pufferbelly choo-choo train blew its whistle as it\r\npulled out of the station. Happy, exhausted children ran across the\r\nplaza, heading for the ferry docks and the monorail ramps. The stones\r\nbeneath her feet glittered with rainbow light, and tropical birds\r\ncalled to each other from the Pirates of the Caribbean Adventure\r\nIsland in the middle of the lake.\r\n\r\n\"Hum,\" she said. The families laughed and jostled each\r\nother. \"Hum. OK, one time only. This one is off the record.\"\r\n\r\nSammy looked around nervously. \"Keep walking,\" he said. \"Let's get\r\npast here and back into the private spots.\"\r\n\r\n*But it's the crowds that put me in a generous mood.* She didn't say\r\n it. She'd give him this one. What harm could it do? If it was\r\n something she had to publish, she could get it from another source.\r\n\r\n\"They're going to sue your friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what else is new?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, personally. They're going to the mattresses. Every trumped up\r\ncharge they can think of. But the point here isn't to get the cops to\r\nraid them, it's to serve discovery on every single communication,\r\nevery document, every file. Open up everything. Root through every\r\nemail until they find something to hang them with.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say 'they' -- aren't *you* 'they'?\"\r\n\r\nIt was too dark to see his face now, but she could tell the question\r\nmade him uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\"No. Not anymore.\" He swallowed and looked out at the lake. \"Look, I'm\r\ndoing something now -- something... *amazing*. The DiaB, it's breaking\r\nnew ground. We're putting three-d printers into every house in\r\nAmerica. What your friend Lester is doing, it's actually *helping*\r\nus. We're inventing a whole new --\"\r\n\r\n\"Business?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not just a business. A world. It's what the New Work was missing\r\n-- a three-d printer in every living room. A killer app. There were\r\npersonal computers and geeks for years before the spreadsheet came\r\nalong. Then there was a reason to put one in every house. Then we got\r\nthe Internet, the whole software industry. A new world. That's where\r\nwe're headed. It's all I want to do. I don't want to spend the rest of\r\nmy life suing people. I want to *do stuff*.\"\r\n\r\nHe kicked at the rushes that grew beside the trail. \"I want to be\r\nremembered for that. I want *that* to be my place in the history books\r\n-- not a bunch of lawsuits.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne walked along beside him in silence for a time. \"OK, so what do\r\nyou want me to do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought that if --\" He shut up. \"Look, I tried this once before. I\r\ntold that Freddy bastard everything in the hopes that he'd come onto\r\nmy side and help me out. He screwed me. I'm not saying you're Freddy,\r\nbut --\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne stopped walking. \"What do you want from me, sir? You have\r\nhardly been a friend to me and mine. It's true that you've made\r\nsomething very fine, but it's also true that you helped sabotage\r\nsomething every bit as fine. You're painting yourself as the victim of\r\nsome mysterious 'them.' But as near as I can work out, the only\r\ndifference between you and 'them' is that you're having a little\r\ndisagreement with them. I don't like to be used as part of your\r\ncorporate head-games and power-struggles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine,\" he said. \"Fine. I deserve that. I deserve no\r\nbetter. Fine. Well, I tried.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne refused to soften. Grown men sulking did not inspire any\r\nsympathy in her. Whatever he wanted to tell her, it wasn't worth going\r\ninto his debt.\r\n\r\nHe gave a shuddering sigh. \"Well, I've taken you away from your\r\nevening of fun. Can I make it up to you? Would you like to come with\r\nme on some of my favorite rides?\"\r\n\r\nThis surprised her a little, but when she thought about it, she\r\ncouldn't see why not. \"Sure,\" she said.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nTaking a guest around Disney World was like programming a playlist for\r\na date or a car-trip. Sammy had done it three or four times for people\r\nhe was trying to win over (mostly women he was trying to screw) and he\r\nrefined his technique every time.\r\n\r\nSo he took her to the Carousel of Progress. It was the oldest\r\nuntouched ride in the park, a replica of the one that Walt himself had\r\nbuilt for GE at the 1964 World's Fair. There had been attempts to\r\nupdate it over the years, but they'd all been ripped out and the show\r\nrestored to its mid-sixties glory.\r\n\r\nIt was a revolving theater where robots danced and sang and talked\r\nthrough the American Century, from the last days of the coal stove up\r\nto the dawn of the space age. It had a goofy, catchy song, cornball\r\njokes, and he relished playing guide and telling his charges about the\r\ntime that the revolving theater had trapped a careless castmember in\r\nits carousel and crushed her to death. That juxtaposition of sunny,\r\ngoofy American corporate optimism and the macabre realities of\r\noperating a park where a gang of half-literate minimum-wage workers\r\nspent their days shovelling the world's rich children into modified\r\nthreshing machines -- it was delicious.\r\n\r\nSuzanne's body language told him the whole story from the second she\r\nsat down, arms folded, a barely contained smirk on her lips. The\r\nlights played over the GE logo, which had acquired an even more\r\nanachronistic luster since the last time he'd been. Now that GE had\r\nbeen de-listed from the NYSE, it was only a matter of time before they\r\nyanked the sponsorship, but for now, it made the ride seem like it was\r\npart time-machine. Transported back to the corporate Pleistocene, when\r\ngiant dinocorps thundered over the plains.\r\n\r\nThe theater rotated to the first batch of singing, wise-cracking\r\nrobots. Her eyebrows shot up and she shook her head bemusedly. Out\r\ncame the second batch, the third -- now they were in the fabulous\r\nforties and the Andrews Sisters played while grandma and grandpa robot\r\nwatched a bulging fish-eye TV and sister got vibrated by an electric\r\nslimming belt. The jokes got worse, the catchy jingle -- \"There's a\r\ngreat big beautiful tomorrow, shining at the end of every daaaaay!\" --\r\ngot repeated with more vigor.\r\n\r\n\"It's like an American robot performance of *Triumph of the Will*,\"\r\nshe whispered to him, and he cracked up. They were the only two in the\r\ntheater. It was never full, and he himself had taken part in spitball\r\nexercises brainstorming replacements, but institutionally, Disney\r\nParks couldn't bring itself to shut it down. There was always some\r\nexcuse -- rabid fans, historical interest, competing priorities -- but\r\nit came down to the fact that no one wanted to bring the axe down on\r\nthe robot family.\r\n\r\nThe final segment now, the whole family enjoying a futuristic\r\nChristmas with a high-tech kitchen whose voice-activated stove went\r\nhaywire. All the robots were on stage for the segment, and they\r\nexhorted the audience to sing and clap along. Sammy gave in and\r\nclapped, and a second later, Suzanne did, too, laughing at the\r\nsilliness of it all. When the house lights came up and the bored --\r\nbut unsquashed -- castmember spieled them out of the ride, Sammy had a\r\nbounce in his step and the song in his head.\r\n\r\n\"That was *terrible*!\" Suzanne said.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it great?\"\r\n\r\n\"God, I'll never get that song out of my head.\" They moved through the\r\nflashing lights of Tomorrowland.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that -- no line on Space Mountain,\" Sammy said, pointing.\r\n\r\nSo they rode Space Mountain -- twice. Then they caught the\r\nfireworks. Then Sammy took her over to Tom Sawyer Island on a\r\nmaintenance boat and they sat up in the tree house and watched as the\r\npark heaved and thronged, danced and ran, laughed and chattered.\r\n\r\n\"Hear the rustling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, what is that, rabbits or something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Giant rats.\" Sammy grinned in the dark. \"Giant, feral rats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, you're joking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cross my heart. We drain the lake every now and then and they migrate\r\nto the island. No predators. Lots of dropped french fries -- it's\r\nratopia here. They get as big as cats. Bold little fuckers too. No one\r\nlikes to be here alone at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about us?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're together.\"\r\n\r\nThe rustling grew louder and they held their breath. A bold rat like a\r\nraccoon picked its way across the path below them. Then two\r\nmore. Suzanne shivered and Sammy did, too. They were huge, feral,\r\nmenacing.\r\n\r\n\"Want to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell *yes*,\" she said. She fumbled in her purse and came out with a\r\nbright little torch that shone like a beacon. You weren't supposed to\r\nuse bright lights on the island after hours while the rest of the park\r\nwas open, but Sammy was glad of it.\r\n\r\nBack on the mainland, they rode Big Thunder Mountain and moseyed over\r\nto the new, half-rebuilt Fantasyland. The zombie maze was still open,\r\nand they got lost in it amid the groans, animatronic shamblers, and\r\ngiggling kids running through the hedges.\r\n\r\nSomething happened in the maze. Between entering it and leaving it,\r\nthey lost their cares. Instead of talking about the park and\r\nHackelberg, they talked about ways of getting out of the maze, talked\r\nabout which zombie was coming next, about the best zombie movies\r\nthey'd ever seen, about memorable Halloweens. As they neared the exit,\r\nthey started to strategize about the best ride to go on next. Suzanne\r\nhad done the Haunted Mansion twice when she first arrived and now --\r\n\r\n\"Come on, it's such a cliche,\" Sammy said. \"Anyone can be a Haunted\r\nMansion fan. It's like being a Mickey fan. It takes real character to\r\nbe a Goofy fan.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a Goofy fan, I take it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed. And I'm also a Jungle Cruise man.\"\r\n\r\n\"More corny jokes?\"\r\n\r\n\"'We've been *dying* to have you' -- talk about cornball humor.\"\r\n\r\nThey rode both. The park was closing, and all around them, people were\r\nstreaming away from the rides. No lines at all, not even in front of\r\nthe rollercoasters, not even in front of Dumbo, not even in front of\r\nthe ultra-violent fly-over of the world of the zombies (nee Peter\r\nPan's Flight, and a perennial favorite).\r\n\r\n\"You know, I haven't just *enjoyed* the park like this in years.\" He\r\nwas wearing a huge foam Goofy hat that danced and bobbed on his head,\r\ntrying to do little pas-de-deux with the other Goofy hats in the\r\nvicinity. It also let out the occassional chuckle and snatch of song.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up,\" Suzanne said. \"Don't talk about magic. Live magic.\"\r\n\r\nThey closed the park, letting themselves get herded off of Main Street\r\nalong with the last stragglers. He looked over his shoulder as they\r\nmoved through the arches under the train-station. The night crew was\r\nmoving through the empty Main Street, hosing down the streets,\r\nsweeping, scrubbing. As he watched, the work lights came on, throwing\r\nthe whole thing into near-daylight illumination, making it seem less\r\nlike an enchanted wonderland and more like a movie set, an artifice. A\r\nsham.\r\n\r\nIt was one in the morning and he was exhausted. And Hackelberg was\r\ngoing to sue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sammy, what do you want me to do, blackmail him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know -- sure. Why not? You could call him and say, 'I hear\r\nyou're working on this lawsuit, but don't you think it's hypocritical\r\nwhen you've been doing all this bad stuff --'\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't blackmail people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine. Tell your friends, then. Tell some lawyers. That could work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sammy, I think we're going to have to fight this suit on its merits,\r\nnot on the basis of some sneaky intel. I appreciate the risk you're\r\nputting yourself to --\"\r\n\r\n\"We ripped off some of Lester's code for the DiaB.\" He blurted it out,\r\nnot believing he was hearing himself say it. \"I didn't know it at the\r\ntime. The libraries were on the net and my guys were in a hurry, and\r\nthey just imported it into the build and left it there -- they rewrote\r\nit with the second shipment, but we put out a million units running a\r\nlibrary Lester wrote for volumetric imaging. It was under some crazy\r\nviral open source license and we were supposed to publish all our\r\nmodifications, and we never did.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne threw her head back and laughed, long and hard. Sammy found\r\nhimself laughing along with her.\r\n\r\n\"OK,\" she said. \"OK. That's a good one. I'll tell Lester about\r\nit. Maybe he'll want to use it. Maybe he'll want to sue.\"\r\n\r\nSammy wanted to ask her if she'd keep his name out of it, but he\r\ncouldn't ask. He'd gone to Hackelberg with the info as soon as he'd\r\nfound out and they'd agreed to keep it quiet. The Imagineers\r\nresponsible had had a very firm talking to, and had privately admitted\r\nto a curious and aghast Sammy over beers that everyone everywhere did\r\nthis all the time, that it was so normal as to be completely\r\nunremarkable. He was pretty sure that a judge wouldn't see it that\r\nway.\r\n\r\nSuzanne surprised him by giving him a strong, warm hug. \"You're not\r\nthe worst guy in the world, Sammy Page,\" she said. \"Thanks for showing\r\nme around your park.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nKettlewell had been almost pathetic in his interest in helping Lester\r\nout. Lester got the impression that he'd been sitting around his\r\napartment, moping, ever since Eva had taken the kids and gone. As\r\nLester unspooled the story for him -- Suzanne wouldn't tell him how\r\nshe'd found this out, and he knew better than to ask -- Kettlewell\r\ngrew more and more excited. By the time Lester was through, he was\r\npractically slobbering into the phone.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, oh, oh, this is going to be a *fun* phoner,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You'll do it, then? Even after everything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does Perry know you've called me?\"\r\n\r\nLester swallowed. \"No,\" he said. \"I don't talk to Perry much these\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\nKettlewell sighed. \"What the hell am I going to do with you two?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be sorry. Be happy. Someone should be happy around here.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nHerve Guignol chaired the executive committee. Sammy had known him for\r\nyears. They'd come east together from San Jose, where Guignol had run\r\nthe entertainment side of eBay. They'd been recruited by Disney Parks\r\nat the same time, during the hostile takeover and breakup, and they'd\r\nhad their share of nights out, golf games, and stupid movies together.\r\n\r\nBut when Guignol was wearing his chairman's hat, it was like he was a\r\ndifferent person. The boardroom was filled with huge, ergonomic\r\nchairs, the center of the table lined with bottles of imported water\r\nand trays of fanciful canapes in the shapes of Disney\r\ncharacters. Sammy sat to Guignol's left and Hackelberg sat to his\r\nright.\r\n\r\nGuignol brought the meeting to order and the rest of the committee\r\nstopped chatting and checking email and looked expectant. At the touch\r\nof a button, the door swung shut with an authoritative clunk and\r\nshutters slid down over the window.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, and thank you for attending on such short notice. You know\r\nAugustus Hackelberg; he has something to present to you.\"\r\n\r\nHackelberg climbed to his feet and looked out at them. He didn't look\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\"An issue has arisen --\" Sammy loved the third person passive voice\r\nthat dominated corporate meetings. Like the issue had arisen all on\r\nits own, spontaneously. \"A decision that was taken has come back to\r\nbite us.\" He explained about the DiaBs and the code, laying it out\r\nmore or less as it happened, though of course he downplayed his\r\ninvolvement in advising Sammy to go ahead and ship.\r\n\r\nThe committee asked a few intense questions, none directed at Sammy,\r\nwho kept quiet, though he instinctively wanted to defend his\r\nrecord. They took a break after an hour, and Sammy found himself in a\r\ncorner with Guignol.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think?\" Sammy asked him.\r\n\r\nGuignol grimaced. \"I think we're pretty screwed. Someone is going to\r\nhave to take a fall for this, you know. It's going to cost us a\r\nfortune.\"\r\n\r\nSammy nodded. \"Well, unless we just settle with them,\" he said. \"You\r\nknow -- we drop the suit we just filed and they drop theirs....\" He\r\nhad hoped that this would come out on its own, but it was clear that\r\nHackelberg wasn't going to offer it up himself. He was too in love\r\nwith the idea of getting his hands on Perry and Lester.\r\n\r\nGuignol rocked his head from side to side. \"You think they'd go for\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nSammy dropped his voice to a whisper and turned away from the rest of\r\nthe room to confound any lip-readers. \"I think they've *offered* to do\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol cut his eyes over to Hackelberg and Sammy nodded,\r\nimperceptibly.\r\n\r\nGuignol moved away, leaving Sammy to eat a Mickey head built from\r\nchunks of salmon and hamachi. Guignol moved among the committee,\r\ntalking to a few members. Sammy recognized the behavior --\r\nconsolidating power. Hard to remember that this was the guy he'd\r\nplayed savage, high-stakes games of putt-putt golf with.\r\n\r\nThe meeting reconvened. No one looked at Sammy. They all looked at\r\nHackelberg.\r\n\r\n\"What about trying to settle the suit?\" Guignol said.\r\n\r\nHackelberg flushed. \"I don't know if that's possible --\"\r\n\r\n\"What about if we offer to settle in exchange for dropping the suit\r\nwe've just filed?\"\r\n\r\nHackelberg's hands squeezed the side of the table. \"I don't think that\r\nthat would be a wise course of action. This is the opportunity we've\r\nbeen waiting for -- the chance to crack them wide open and see what's\r\ngoing on inside. Discover just what they've taken from us and how. Out\r\nthem for all their bad acts.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol nodded. \"OK, that's true. Now, as I understand it, every DiaB\r\nwe shipped with this Banks person's code on it is a separate act of\r\ninfringement. We shipped a million of them. What's the potential\r\nliability per unit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Courts usually award --\"\r\n\r\nGuignol knocked quietly on the table. \"What's the *potential\r\nliability* -- what's the size of the bill a court *could* hand down,\r\nif a jury was involved? If, say, this became part of someone's\r\nlitigation portfolio.\"\r\n\r\nHackelberg looked away. \"It's up to five hundred thousand per separate\r\nact of infringement.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol nodded. \"So, we're looking at a ceiling on the liability at\r\n$500 billion, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Technically, yes. But --\"\r\n\r\n\"I propose that we offer a settlement, quid-pro-quo with this Banks\r\nperson. We drop our suit if he indemnifies us from damages for his.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seconded,\" said someone at the table. Things were picking up\r\nsteam. Sammy bit the inside of his cheek to keep his smile in check.\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" Hackelberg said. \"Gentlemen and lady, please. While it's true\r\nthat damages can technically run to $500,000 per infringement, that\r\nsimply isn't done. Not to entities like this firm. Listen, we *wrote*\r\nthat law so we could sue people who took from *us*. It won't be used\r\nagainst us. We will face, at worst, a few hundred dollars per act of\r\ninfringement. Still a sizable sum of money, but in the final analysis\r\n--\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" Guignol said. \"All in favor of offering a settlement?\"\r\n\r\nIt was unanimous -- except for Hackelberg.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSammy got his rematch with Hackelberg when the quarterly financials\r\ncame out. It was all that black ink, making him giddy.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to be disrespectful,\" he said, knowing that in\r\nHackelberg's books, there could be nothing more disrespectful than\r\nchallenging him. \"But we need to confront some business realities\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nHackelberg's office was nothing like Sammy had expected -- not a\r\nsouthern gentleman's study lined with hunting trophies and framed\r\nancestral photos. It was as spare as the office of a temp, almost\r\nempty save for a highly functional desk, built-in bookcases lined with\r\nlaw-books, and a straight-backed chair. It was ascetic, severe, and it\r\nwas more intimidating than any dark-wood den could hope to be.\r\n\r\nHackelberg's heavy eyelids drooped a little, the corners of his eyes\r\ngoing down with them. It was like staring down a gator. Sammy resisted\r\nthe urge to look away.\r\n\r\n\"The numbers don't lie. DiaB is making us a fortune, and most of it's\r\ncoming from the platform, not the goop and not the increased visitor\r\nnumbers. We're making money because other people are figuring out ways\r\nto use our stuff. It's our fastest-growing revenue source and if it\r\ncontinues, we're going to end up being a DiaB company with a\r\nside-business in theme-parks.\r\n\r\n\"That's the good news. The bad news is that these characters in the\r\nghost mall have us in their crosshairs. They're prying us open faster\r\nthan we can lock ourselves down. But here's another way of looking at\r\nit: every time they add another feature to the DiaB, they make owning\r\na DiaB more attractive, which makes it easier for us to sell access to\r\nthe platform to advertisers.\"\r\n\r\nHackelberg held up his hands. \"Samuel, I think I've heard enough. Your\r\njob is to figure out new businesses for us to diversify into. My job\r\nis to contain our liability and protect our brand and investors. It\r\nsounds a lot to me like you're saying that you want me to leave off\r\ndoing my job so that you can do yours.\"\r\n\r\nSammy squirmed. \"No, that's not it at all. We both want to protect the\r\nbusiness. I'm not saying that you need to give these guys a free\r\nride. What I'm saying is, suing these guys is *not* good for our\r\nbusiness. It costs us money, goodwill -- it distracts us from doing\r\nour jobs.\"\r\n\r\nHackelberg leaned back and looked coolly into Sammy's eyes. \"What are\r\nyou proposing as an alternative, then?\"\r\n\r\nThe idea had come to Sammy in the shower one morning, as he mentally\r\ncalculated the size of his coming quarterly bonus. A great idea. Out\r\nof the box thinking. The right answer to the question that no one had\r\nthought to ask. It had seemed so *perfect* then. Now, though --\r\n\r\n\"I think we should buy them out.\"\r\n\r\nHackelberg's thin, mirthless grin made his balls shrivel up.\r\n\r\nSammy held up his hands. \"Here, look at this. I drew up some\r\nfigures. What they're earning. What we earn from them. Growth\r\nestimates over the next five quarters. It's not just some random idea\r\nI had in the shower. This makes *sense*.\" He passed over a sheaf of\r\npapers, replete with pie-charts.\r\n\r\nHackelberg set it down in the center of his desk, perfectly square to\r\nthe corners. He flipped through the first five pages, then squared the\r\nstack up again.\r\n\r\n\"You've done a lot of work here, Samuel. I can really see that.\"\r\n\r\nHe got up from his straight-backed chair, lifted Sammy's papers\r\nbetween his thumb and forefinger, and crossed to the wall. There was a\r\nshredder there, its maw a wide rectangle, the kind of thing that you\r\ncan stick entire hardcover books (or hard drives) into. Calmly,\r\nHackelberg fed Sammy's paper into the shredder, fastidiously holding\r\nthe paper-clipped corner between thumb and forefinger, then dropping\r\nthe corner in once the rest had been digested.\r\n\r\n\"I won't ask you for your computer,\" he said, settling back into his\r\nchair. \"But I expect that you will back up your other data and then\r\nsend the hard-drive to IT to be permanently erased. I don't want any\r\nrecord of this, period. I want this done by the end of business\r\ntoday.\"\r\n\r\nSammy's mouth hung open. He shut it. Then he opened it again.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, Hackelberg stood, knocking his chair to the ground behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Not one word, do you understand me? Not one solitary word, you\r\ngoddamned idiot! We're in the middle of being sued by these people. I\r\n*know* you know this, since it's your fault that it's happening. I\r\nknow that you know that the stakes are the *entire* company. Now, say\r\na jury were to discover that we were considering buying these assholes\r\nout? Say a jury were to decide that our litigation was a base\r\nstratagem to lower the asking price for their, their *company* --\" The\r\nword dripped with sarcasm -- \"what do you suppose would happen? If you\r\nhad the sense of a five year old, you'd have known better than to do\r\nthis. Good Christ, Page, I should have security escort you to the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n\"Turn on your heel and go weep in the corridor. Don't stand in my\r\noffice for one more second. Get your computer to IT by 2PM. I will\r\ncheck. That goes for anyone you worked with on this, anyone who has a\r\ncopy of this information. Now, leave.\" Sammy stood rooted in\r\nplace. \"LEAVE, you ridiculous little dog's-pizzle, get out of my\r\nsight!\"\r\n\r\nSammy drew in a deep breath. He thought about saying something like,\r\n*You can't talk to me like that*, but it was very likely that\r\nHackelberg could talk to him just like that. He felt light-headed and\r\na little sick, and he backed slowly out of the office.\r\n\r\nStanding in the corridor, he began to shake. He pounded the elevator\r\nbutton, and felt the eyes of Hackelberg's severe secretary burning\r\ninto his back. Abruptly, he turned away and yanked open the staircase\r\ndoor so hard it smashed into the wall with a loud bang. He took the\r\nstairs in a rush of desperate claustrophobia, wanting more than\r\nanything to get outside, to breathe in the fresh air.\r\n\r\nHe stumbled on the way down, falling a couple of steps and smashing\r\ninto the wall on the landing. He stood, pressed against the wall, the\r\ncold cinder block on his cheek, which felt like it might be\r\nbruised. The pain was enough to bring him back to his senses.\r\n\r\nThis is ridiculous. He had the right answer. Hackelberg was\r\nwrong. Hackelberg didn't run the company. Yes, it was hard to get\r\nanything done without his sign-off, but it wasn't impossible. Going\r\nbehind Hackelberg's back to the executive committee could cost him his\r\njob, of course.\r\n\r\nOf course.\r\n\r\nSammy realized that he didn't actually *care* if he lost his job. Oh,\r\nthe thought made his chest constrict and thoughts of living in a\r\nrefrigerator box materialize in his mind's eye, but beyond that, he\r\nreally didn't care. It was such a goddamned roller-coaster ride --\r\nSammy smiled grimly at the metaphor. You guess right, you end up on\r\ntop. You guess wrong, you bottom out. He spent half his career lording\r\nit over the poor guessers and the other half panicking about a bad\r\nguess he'd made. He thought of Perry and Lester, thought of that night\r\nin Boston. He'd killed their ride and the party had gone on all the\r\nsame. They had something, in that crazy shantytown, something pure and\r\nhappy, some camaraderie that he'd always assumed he'd get someday, but\r\nthat had never materialized.\r\n\r\nIf this was his dream job, how much worse would unemployment really\r\nbe?\r\n\r\nHe would go to the executive committee. He would not erase his\r\nnumbers. He set off for his office, moving quickly, purposefully, head\r\nup. A last stand, how exciting, why not?\r\n\r\nHe piloted the little golf-cart down the back road and was nearly at\r\nhis building's door when he spotted the security detail. Three of\r\nthem, in lightweight Disney cop uniforms, wearing ranger hats and\r\nlooking around alertly. Hackelberg must have sent them there to make\r\nsure that he followed through with deleting his data.\r\n\r\nHe stopped the golf cart abruptly and reversed out of the driveway\r\nbefore the guards spotted him. He needed to get his files somewhere\r\nthat Hackelberg wouldn't be able to retrieve them. He zipped down the\r\nservice roads, thinking furiously.\r\n\r\nThe answer occurred to him in the form of a road-sign for the\r\nPolynesian hotel. He turned up its drive and parked the golf-cart. As\r\nhe stepped out, he removed his employee badge and untucked his\r\nshirt. Now he was just another sweaty fresh-arrived tourist, Dad\r\ncoming in to rendezvous with Mom and the kids, back from some banal\r\nmeeting that delayed his arrival, hasn't even had time to change into\r\na t-shirt.\r\n\r\nHe headed straight for the sundries store and bought a postage-paid\r\nWalt Disney World postcard with a little magnetic patch mounted on one\r\ncorner. You filled up the memory with a couple hours' worth of video\r\nand as many photos as you wanted and mailed it off. The pixelated\r\ndisplay on the front played a slide show of the images -- at least\r\nonce a year, some honeymoon couple would miss this fact and throw a\r\ncouple racy bedroom shots in the mix, to the perennial delight of the\r\nmail room.\r\n\r\nHe hastily wrote some banalities about the great time he and the kids\r\nwere having in Disney World, then he opened his computer and looked up\r\nthe address that the Church woman had checked in under. He addressed\r\nit, simply, to \"Suzanne,\" to further throw off the scent, then he\r\nslipped it into a mail-slot with a prayer to the gods of journalist\r\nshield laws.\r\n\r\nHe walked as calmly as he could back to his golf-cart, clipping on his\r\nemployee badge and tucking his shirt back in. Then he motored calmly\r\nto his office building. The Disney cops were sweating under the\r\nmid-day sun.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Page?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm to take your computer to IT, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Sammy said, with perfect calm. \"I think we'll GO\r\nup to my office and call a meeting of the executive committee\r\ninstead.\"\r\n\r\nThe security guard was young, Latino, and skinny. His short\r\nback-and-sides left his scalp exposed to the sun. He took his hat off\r\nand mopped his forehead with a handkerchief, exposing a line of acne\r\nwhere his hat-band irritated the skin.  It made Sammy feel sorry for\r\nthe kid -- especially considering that Sammy earned more than 20 times\r\nthe kid's salary.\r\n\r\n\"This really isn't your job, I know,\" Sammy said, wondering where all\r\nthis sympathy for the laboring classes had come from, anyway? \"I don't\r\nwant to make it hard for you. We'll go inside. You can hang on to the\r\ncomputer. We'll talk to some people. If they tell you to go ahead, you\r\ngo ahead. Otherwise, we go see them, all right?\"\r\n\r\nHe held his computer out to the kid, who took it.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go up to my office now,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe kid shook his head. \"I'm supposed to take this --\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know. But we have a deal.\" The kid looked like he would\r\nhead out anyway. \"And there are backups in my office, so you need to\r\ncome and get those, too.\"\r\n\r\nThat did it. The kid looked a little grateful as they went inside,\r\nwhere the air conditioning was blowing icy cold.\r\n\r\n\"You should have waited in the lobby, Luis,\" Sammy said, reading the\r\nkid's name off his badge. \"You must be boiled.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had instructions,\" Luis said.\r\n\r\nSammy made a face. \"They don't sound like very reasonable\r\ninstructions. All the more reason to sort this out, right?\"\r\n\r\nSammy had his secretary get Luis a bottle of cold water and a little\r\nplate of grapes and berries out of the stash he kept for his visitors,\r\nthen he called Guignol from his desk phone.\r\n\r\n\"It's Sammy. I need to call an emergency meeting of the exec\r\ncommittee,\" he said without preamble.\r\n\r\n\"This is about Hackelberg, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's already called you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was very persuasive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can be persuasive, too. Give me a chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what will happen if you push this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I might save the company.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might,\" Guignol said. \"And you might --\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" Sammy said. \"What the hell, it's only a career.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't keep your data -- Hackelberg is right about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can send all the backups and my computer to your office right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was under the impression that they were all on their way to IT for\r\ndisposal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. There's a security castmember in my office with me named\r\nLuis. If you want to call dispatch and have them direct him to bring\r\nthis stuff to you instead --\"\r\n\r\n\"Sammy, do you understand what you're doing here?\"\r\n\r\nSammy suppressed a mad giggle. \"I do,\" he said. \"I understand exactly\r\nwhat I'm doing. I want to help you all understand that, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm calling security dispatch now.\"\r\n\r\nA moment later, Luis's phone rang and the kid listened intently,\r\nnodding unconsciously. Once he'd hung up, Sammy passed him his\r\nbackups, hardcopy and computer. \"Let's go,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" Luis said, and led the way.\r\n\r\nIt was a short ride to the casting office building, where Guignol had\r\nhis office. The wind felt terrific on his face, drying his sweat. It\r\nhad been a long day.\r\n\r\nWhen they pulled up, Sammy let Luis lead the way again, badging in\r\nbehind him, following him up to the seventh-floor board-room. at the\r\nend of the Gold Coast where the most senior offices were.\r\n\r\nGuignol met them at the door and took the materials from Luis, then\r\nushered Sammy in. Sammy caught Luis's eye, and Luis surprised him by\r\nwinking and slipping him a surreptitious thumbs-up, making Sammy feel\r\nlike they shared a secret.\r\n\r\nThere were eight on the executive committee, but they travelled a\r\nlot. Sammy had expected to see no more than four. There were two. And\r\nHackelberg, of course. The lawyer was the picture of saurian calm.\r\n\r\nSammy sat down at the table and helped himself to a glass of water,\r\nwatching a ring pool on the table's polished and waxed wooden surface.\r\n\r\n\"Samuel,\" Hackelberg said, shaking his head. \"I hoped it wouldn't come\r\nto this.\"\r\n\r\nSammy took a deep breath, looking for that don't-give-a-shit calm that\r\nhad suffused him before. It was there still, not as potent, but\r\nthere. He drew upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Let's put this to the committee, shall we? I mean, we already know\r\nhow we feel.\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't be necessary,\" Hackelberg said. \"The committee has already\r\nvoted on this.\"\r\n\r\nSammy closed his eyes and rubbed the bridge of his nose. He looked at\r\nHackelberg, who was smiling grimly, a mean grin that went all the way\r\nto the corners of his eyes.\r\n\r\nSammy looked around at Guignol and the committee members. They\r\nwouldn't meet his eye. Guignol gestured Luis into the room and handed\r\nhim Sammy's computer, papers, and backups. He leaned in and spoke\r\nquietly to him. Luis turned and left.\r\n\r\nGuignol cleared his throat. \"There's nothing else to discuss, then,\"\r\nhe said. \"Thank you all for coming.\"\r\n\r\nIn his heart, Sammy had known this was coming. Hackelberg would beat\r\nhim to the committee -- never let him present his side. Watching the\r\nlawyer get up stiffly and leave with slow, dignified steps, Sammy had\r\na moment's intuition about what it must be like to be that man --\r\npossessed of a kind of cold, furious power that came from telling\r\neveryone that not obeying you to the letter would put them in terrible\r\ndanger. He knew that line of reasoning: It was the same one he got\r\nfrom the TSA at the airport before they bent him over and greased him\r\nup. *You can't understand the grave danger we all face. You must obey\r\nme, for only I can keep it at bay.*\r\n\r\nHe waited for the rest of the committee to file out. None of them\r\nwould meet his eye. Then it was just him and Guignol. Sammy raised his\r\neyebrows and spread out his hands, miming *What happens now?*\r\n\r\n\"You won't be able to get anything productive done until IT gets\r\nthrough with your computer. Take some time off. Call up Dinah and see\r\nif she wants to grab some holiday time.\"\r\n\r\n\"We split,\" Sammy said. He drank his water and stood up. \"I've just\r\ngot one question before I go.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol winced but stood his ground. \"Go ahead,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want to know what the numbers looked like?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not my job to overrule legal --\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll get to that in a second. It's not the question. The question\r\nis, don't you *want to know*?\"\r\n\r\nGuignol sighed. \"You know I want to know. Of course I want to\r\nknow. This isn't about me and what I want, though. It's about making\r\nsure we don't endanger the shareholders --\"\r\n\r\n\"So ignoring this path, sticking our heads in the sand, that's *good*\r\nfor the shareholders?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, of course it's not good for the shareholders. But it's better\r\nthan endangering the whole company --\"\r\n\r\nSammy nodded. \"Well, how about if we both take some time off and drive\r\ndown to Hollywood. It'd do us some good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sammy, I've got a job to do --\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, but without your computer...\"\r\n\r\nGuignol looked at him. \"What did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not what I did. It's what I might have done. I'm going to be a\r\ngood boy and give Hackelberg a list of everyone I might have emailed\r\nabout this. All those people are losing their computers to the big\r\nmagnet at IT.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you never emailed me about this --\"\r\n\r\n\"You sure? I might have. It's the kind of thing I might have\r\ndone. Maybe your spam-filter ate it. You never know. That's what IT's\r\nfor.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol looked angry for a moment, then laughed. \"You are such a\r\nshithead. Fuck that lawyer asshole anyway. What are you driving these\r\ndays?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just bought a new Dell Luminux,\" Sammy said, grinning\r\nback. \"Rag-top.\"\r\n\r\n\"When do we leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll pick you up at 6AM tomorrow. Beat the morning traffic.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSuzanne was getting sick of breakfast in bed. It was hard to imagine\r\nthat such a thing was possible, but there it was. Lester stole out\r\nfrom between the covers before 7AM every day, and then, half an hour\r\nlater, he was back with a laden tray, something new every day. She'd\r\nhad steaks, burritos, waffles, home-made granola, fruit-salad with\r\nGreek yogurt, and today there were eggs Benedict with fresh-squeezed\r\ngrapefruit juice. The tray always came with a French press of\r\nfresh-ground Kona coffee, a cloth napkin, and her computer, so she\r\ncould read the news.\r\n\r\nIn theory, this was a warm ritual that ensured that they had quality\r\ntime together every day, no matter what. In practice, Lester was so\r\nanxious about the food and whether she was enjoying it that she\r\ncouldn't really enjoy it. Plus, she wasn't a fatkins, so three\r\nthousand calorie breakfasts weren't good for her.\r\n\r\nMost of all, it was the pressure to be a happy couple, to have\r\ncemented over the old hurts and started anew. She felt it every\r\nmoment, when Lester climbed into the shower with her and soaped her\r\nback, when he brought home flowers, and when he climbed into bed with\r\nher in the morning to eat breakfast with her.\r\n\r\nShe picked at her caviar and blini glumly and poked at her\r\ncomputer. Beside her, Lester hoovered up three thousand calories'\r\nworth of fried dough and clattered one-handed on his machine.\r\n\r\n\"This is delicious, babe, thanks,\" she said, with as much sincerity as\r\nshe could muster. It was really generous and nice of him to do\r\nthis. She was just a bitter old woman who couldn't be happy no matter\r\nwhat was going on in her life.\r\n\r\nThere was voicemail on her computer, which was unusual. Most people\r\nsent her email. This originated from a pay phone on the Florida\r\nTurnpike.\r\n\r\n\"Ms Church, this is -- ah, this is a person whom you recently had the\r\nacquaintance of, while on your holidays. I have a confidential matter\r\nto discuss with you. I'm travelling to your location with a colleague\r\ntoday and should arrive mid-morning. I hope you can make some time to\r\nmeet with me.\"\r\n\r\nShe listened to it twice. Lester leaned over.\r\n\r\n\"What's that all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not going to believe it. I think it's that Disney guy, the guy\r\nI told you about. The one Death used to work for.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's coming *here*?\"\r\n\r\n\"Apparently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woah. Don't tell Perry.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think?\"\r\n\r\n\"He'd tear that guy's throat out with his teeth.\" Lester took a bite\r\nof blini. \"I might help.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne thought about Sammy. He hadn't been the sort of person she\r\ncould be friends with, but she'd known plenty of his kind in her day,\r\nand he was hardly the worst of the lot. He barely rated above average\r\non the corporate psychopath meter. Somewhere in there, there was a\r\nreal personality. She'd seen it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then I guess I'd better meet with him alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounds like he wants a doctor-patient meeting anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or confessor-penitent.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think he'll leak you something.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a pretty good working theory when it comes to this kind of\r\ncall.\"\r\n\r\nLester ate thoughtfully, then reached over and hit a key on her\r\ncomputer, replaying the call.\r\n\r\n\"He sounds, what, giddy?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, he does, doesn't he. Maybe it's good news.\"\r\n\r\nLester laughed and took away her dishes, and when he came back in, he\r\nwas naked, stripped and ready for the shower. He was a very handsome\r\nman, and he had a devilish grin as he whisked the blanket off of her.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at the foot of the bed and stared at her, his grin quirking\r\nin a way she recognized instantly. She didn't have to look down to\r\nknow that he was getting hard. In the mirror of his eyes, she was\r\nbeautiful. She could see it plainly. When she looked into the real\r\nmirror at the foot of the bed, draped with gauzy sun-scarves and\r\ncrusted around the edges with kitschy tourist magnets Lester brought\r\nhome, she saw a saggy, middle-aged woman with cottage-cheese cellulite\r\nand saddle-bags.\r\n\r\nLester had slept with more fatkins girls than she could count, women\r\nmade into doll-like mannequins by surgery and chemical enhancements,\r\nwomen who read sex manuals in public places and boasted about their\r\nKegel weight-lifting scores.\r\n\r\nBut when he looked at her like that, she knew that she was the most\r\nbeautiful woman he'd ever loved, that he would do anything for\r\nher. That he loved her as much as he could ever love anyone.\r\n\r\n*What the hell was I complaining about?* she thought as he fell on her\r\n like a starving man.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nShe met Sammy in their favorite tea-room, the one perched up on a\r\ncrow's nest four storeys up a corkscrew building whose supplies came\r\nup on a series of dumbwaiters and winches that shrouded its balconies\r\nlike vines.\r\n\r\nShe staked out the best table, the one with the panoramic view of the\r\nwhole shantytown, and ordered a plate of the tiny shortbread cakes\r\nthat were the house specialty, along with a gigantic mug of nonfat\r\ndecaf cappuccino.\r\n\r\nSammy came up the steps red-faced and sweaty, wearing a Hawai'ian\r\nshirt and Bermuda shorts, like some kind of tourist. Or like he was on\r\nholidays? Behind him came a younger man, with severe little designer\r\nglasses, dressed in the conventional polo-shirt and slacks uniform of\r\nthe corporate exec on a non-suit day.\r\n\r\nSuzanne sprinkled an ironic wave at them and gestured to the\r\nmismatched school-room chairs at her table. The waitress -- Shayna --\r\ncame over with two glasses of water and a paper napkin dispenser. The\r\nmen thanked her and mopped their faces and drank their water.\r\n\r\n\"Good drive?\"\r\n\r\nSammy nodded. His friend looked nervous, like he was wondering what\r\nmight have been swimming in his water glass. \"This is some place.\"\r\n\r\n\"We like it here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there, you know, a bathroom?\" the companion asked.\r\n\r\n\"Through there.\" Suzanne pointed.\r\n\r\n\"How do you deal with the sewage around here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sewage? Mr Page, sewage is *solved*. We feed it into our generators\r\nand the waste heat runs our condenser purifiers. There was talk of\r\nbuilding one big one for the whole town, but that required way too\r\nmuch coordination and anyway, Perry was convinced that having central\r\npoints of failure would be begging for a disaster. I wrote a series on\r\nit. If you'd like I can send you the links.\"\r\n\r\nThe Disney exec made some noises and ate some shortbread, peered at\r\nthe chalk-board menu and ordered some Thai iced tea.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Ms Church -- Suzanne -- thank you for seeing me. I would have\r\nunderstood completely if you'd told me to go fuck myself.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne smiled and made a go-on gesture.\r\n\r\n\"Before my friend comes back from the bathroom, before we meet up with\r\nanyone from your side, I just want you to know this. What you've done,\r\nit's changed the world. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nHe had every appearance of being completely sincere. He was a little\r\nroad-crazed and windblown today, not like she remembered him from\r\nOrlando. What the hell had happened to him? What was he here for?\r\n\r\nHis friend came back and Sammy said, \"I ordered you a Thai iced\r\ntea. This is Suzanne Church, the writer. Ms Church, this is Herve\r\nGuignol, co-director of the Florida regional division of Disney\r\nParks.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol was more put-together and stand-offish than Sammy. He shook\r\nher hand and made executive sounding grunts at her. He was young, and\r\nclearly into playing the role of exec. He reminded Suzanne of fresh\r\nSilicon Valley millionaires who could go from pizza-slinging hackers\r\nto suit-wearing biz-droids who bullshitted knowledgeably about EBITDA\r\novernight.\r\n\r\n*What the hell are you two here for?*\r\n\r\n\"Mr Page --\"\r\n\r\n\"Sammy, call me Sammy, please. Did you get my postcard?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was from you?\" She'd not been able to make heads or tails of it\r\nwhen it arrived in the mail the day before and she'd chucked it out as\r\npart of some viral marketing campaign she didn't want to get infected\r\nby.\r\n\r\n\"You got it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I threw it out.\"\r\n\r\nSammy went slightly green.\r\n\r\n\"But it'll still be in the trash,\" she said. \"Lester never takes it\r\nout, and I haven't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Um, can we go and get it now, all the same?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's on it?\"\r\n\r\nSammy and Guignol exchanged a long look. \"Let's pretend that I gave\r\nyou a long run-up to this. Let's pretend that we spent a lot of time\r\nwith me impressing on you that this is confidential, and not for\r\npublication. Let's pretend that I charmed you and made sure you\r\nunderstood how much respect I have for you and your friends here --\"\r\n\r\n\"I get it,\" Suzanne said, trying not to laugh. *Not for publication*\r\n-- really!\r\n\r\n\"OK, let's pretend all that. Now I'll tell you: what's on that\r\npostcard is the financials for a Disney Parks buyout of your friends'\r\nentire operation here. DiaBolical, the ride, all of it.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne had been expecting a lot of things, but this wasn't one of\r\nthem. It was loopy. Daffy. Not just weird, but inconceivable. As\r\nthough he'd said, \"I sent you our plans to carve your portrait on the\r\nmoon's surface with a green laser.\" But she was a pro. She kept her\r\nface still and neutral, and calmly swallowed her cappuccino.\r\n\r\n\"I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there are -- there are people at Disney who feel like this idea\r\nis so dangerous that it doesn't even warrant discussion. That it\r\nshould be suppressed.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol cleared his throat. \"That's the consensus,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"And normally, I'd say, hey, sure, the consensus. That's great. But\r\nI'll tell you, I drew up these numbers because I was curious, I'm a\r\ncurious guy. I like to think laterally, try stuff that might seem\r\nsilly at first. See where it goes. I've had pretty good instincts.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol and Suzanne snorted at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"And an imperfect record,\" Sammy said. Suzanne didn't want to like\r\nhim, but there was something forthright about him that she couldn't\r\nhelp warming to. There was no subtlety or scheming in this\r\nguy. Whatever he wanted, you could see it right on his face. Maybe he\r\nwas a psycho, but he wasn't a sneak.\r\n\r\n\"So I ran these numbers for my own amusement, to see what they would\r\nlook like. Assume that your boys want, say, 30 times gross annual\r\nrevenue for a buyout. Say that this settles our lawsuit -- not theirs,\r\njust ours, so we don't have to pay for the trademark suit to go\r\nforward. Assume that they generate one DiaBolical-scale idea every six\r\nmonths --\" Suzanne found herself nodding along, especially at this\r\nlast one. \"Well, you make those assumptions and you know what comes\r\nout of it?\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne let the numbers dance behind her own eyelids. She'd followed\r\nall the relevant financials closely for years, so closely that they\r\nwere as familiar as her monthly take-home and mortgage payments had\r\nbeen, back when she had a straight job and a straight life.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you'd make Lester and Perry *very* wealthy,\" she said. \"After\r\nthey vested out, they'd be able to live off the interest alone.\"\r\n\r\nSammy nodded judiciously. His sidekick looked alarmed. \"Yup. And for\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, assuming your last quarterly statement was accurate --\"\r\n\r\n\"We were a little conservative,\" Sammy said. The other man nodded\r\nreflexively.\r\n\r\n*You were very conservative,* she thought. *DiaB's making you a\r\n fortune and you didn't want to advertise that to the competition.*\r\n\r\n\"Assuming that, well, you guys earn back your investment in, what, 18\r\nmonths?\"\r\n\r\n\"I figure a year. But 18 months would be good.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you vest the guys out over three years, that means --\"\r\n\r\n\"100 percent ROI, plus or minus 200 percent,\" Sammy said. \"For less\r\nmoney than we'll end up spending on our end of the lawsuit.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol was goggling at them both. Sammy drank his Thai iced-tea,\r\nslurping noisily. He signalled for another one.\r\n\r\n\"And you sent me these financials on a postcard?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was some question about whether they'd be erased before I could\r\nshow them to anyone, and I knew there was no way I'd be given the\r\nchance to re-create them independently. It seemed prudent to have a\r\nbackup copy.\"\r\n\r\n\"A backup copy in my hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, at least I knew you wouldn't give it up without a fight.\" Sammy\r\nshrugged and offered her a sunny smile.\r\n\r\n\"We'd better go rescue that postcard from the basket before Lester\r\ndevelops a domestic instinct and takes out the trash, then,\" Suzanne\r\nsaid, pushing away from the table. Shayna brought the bill and Sammy\r\npaid it, overtipping by a factor of ten, which endeared him further to\r\nSuzanne. She couldn't abide rich people who stiffed on the tip.\r\n\r\nSuzanne walked them through the shantytown, watching their reactions\r\nclosely. She liked to take new people here. She'd witnessed its birth\r\nand growth, then gone away during its adolescence, and now she got to\r\nenjoy its maturity. Crowds of kids ran screeching and playing through\r\nthe streets, adults nodded at them from their windows, wires and\r\nplumbing and antennas crowded the skies above them. The walls\r\nshimmered with murals and graffiti and mosaics.\r\n\r\nSammy treated it like he had his theme park, seeming to take in every\r\ndetail with a connoisseur's eye; Guignol was more nervous, clearly\r\nfeeling unsafe amid the cheerful lawlessness. They came upon Francis\r\nand a gang of his kids, building bicycles out of stiffened fabric and\r\nstrong monofilament recycled from packing crates.\r\n\r\n\"Ms Church,\" Francis said gravely. He'd given up drinking, maybe for\r\ngood, and he was clear-eyed and charming in his engineer's\r\ncoveralls. The kids -- boys *and* girls, Suzanne noted approvingly --\r\ncontinued to work over the bikes, but they were clearly watching what\r\nFrancis was up to.\r\n\r\n\"Francis, please meet Sammy and his colleague, Herve. They're here for\r\na story I'm working on. Gentlemen, Francis is the closest thing we\r\nhave to a mayor around here.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis shook hands all around, but Sammy's attention was riveted on\r\nthe bicycles.\r\n\r\nFrancis picked one up with two fingers and handed it to him. \"Like it?\r\nWe got the design from a shop in Liberia, but we made our own local\r\nimprovements. The trick is getting the stiffener to stay liquid long\r\nenough to get the fabric stretched out in the right proportion.\"\r\n\r\nSammy took the frame from him and spun it in one hand like a\r\nbaton. \"And the wheels?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mostly we do solids, which stay in true longer. We use the carbon\r\nstiffener on a pre-cut round of canvas or denim, then fit a standard\r\ntire. They go out of true after a while. You just apply some solvent\r\nto them and they go soft again and you re-true them with a compass and\r\na pair of tailor's shears, then re-stiffen them. You get maybe five\r\nyears of hard riding out of a wheel that way.\"\r\n\r\nSammy's eyes were round as saucers. He took one of the proffered\r\nwheels and spun it between opposing fingertips. Then, grinning, he\r\npicked up another wheel and the bike-frame and began to *juggle* them,\r\none-two-three, hoop-la! Francis looked amused, rather than pissed --\r\ngiving up drink had softened his temper. His kids stopped working and\r\nlaughed.  Sammy laughed too. He transferred the wheels to his left\r\nhand, then tossed the frame high the air, spun around and caught it\r\nand then handed it all back to Francis. The kids clapped and he took a\r\nbow.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know you had it in you,\" Guignol said, patting him on the\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nSammy, sweating and grinning like a fool, said, \"Yeah, it's not\r\nsomething I get a lot of chances to do around the office. But did you\r\nsee that? It was light enough to juggle! I mean, how exciting is all\r\nthis?\" He swept his arm around his head. \"Between the sewage and the\r\nmanufacturing and all these kids --\" He broke off. \"What do you do\r\nabout education, Suzanne?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lots of kids bus into the local schools, or ride. But lots more\r\nhome-school these days. We don't get a very high caliber of public\r\nschool around here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might that have something to do with all the residents who don't pay\r\nproperty tax?\" Guignol said pointedly.\r\n\r\nSuzanne nodded. \"I'm sure it does,\" she said. \"But it has more to do\r\nwith the overall quality of public education in this state. 47th in\r\nthe nation for funding.\"\r\n\r\nThey were at her and Lester's place now. She led them through the\r\nfront door and picked up the trash-can next to the little table where\r\nshe sorted the mail after picking it up from her PO box at a little\r\nstrip mall down the road.\r\n\r\nThere was the postcard. She handed it silently to Sammy, who held it\r\nfor a moment, then reluctantly passed it to Guignol. \"You'd better\r\nhang on to it,\" he said, and she sensed that there was something\r\nbigger going on there.\r\n\r\n\"Now we go see Lester,\" Suzanne said.\r\n\r\nHe was behind the building in his little workshop, hacking\r\nDiaBolical. There were five different DiaBs running around him,\r\nchugging and humming. The smell of goop and fuser and heat filled the\r\nroom, and an air-conditioner like a jet-engine labored to keep things\r\ncool. Still, it was a few degrees warmer inside than out.\r\n\r\n\"Lester,\" Suzanne shouted over the air-conditioner din, \"we have\r\nvisitors.\"\r\n\r\nLester straightened up from his keyboard and wiped his palms and\r\nturned to face them. He knew who they were based on his earlier\r\nconversation with Suzanne, but he also clearly recognized Sammy.\r\n\r\n\"You!\" he said. \"You work for Disney?\"\r\n\r\nSammy blushed and looked away.\r\n\r\nLester turned to Suzanne. \"This guy used to come up, what, twice,\r\nthree times a week.\"\r\n\r\nSammy nodded and mumbled something. Lester reached out and snapped off\r\nthe AC, filling the room with eerie silence and stifling heat. \"What\r\nwas that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a great believer in competitive intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n\"You work for Disney?\"\r\n\r\n\"They both work for Disney, Lester,\" Suzanne said. \"This is Sammy and\r\nHerve.\" *Herve doesn't do much talking,* she mentally added, *but he\r\nseems to be in charge*.\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Sammy said, seeming to come to himself at last. \"And\r\nit's an honor to formally meet you at last. I run the DiaB program. I\r\nsee you're a fan. I've read quite a bit about you, of course, thanks\r\nto Ms Church here.\"\r\n\r\nLester's hands closed and opened, closed and opened. \"You were, what,\r\nyou were sneaking around here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I mentioned that I'm a great fan of *your work*? Not just the\r\nride, either. This DiaBolical, well, it's --\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne had expected something like this. Lester wasn't like Perry, he\r\nwouldn't go off the deep-end with this guy, but he wasn't going to be\r\nhis best buddy, either. Still, someone needed to intervene before this\r\nmelted down altogether.\r\n\r\n\"Lester,\" she said, putting her hand on his warm shoulder. \"Do you\r\nwant to show these guys what you're working on?\"\r\n\r\nHe blew air through his nose a couple times, then settled down. He\r\neven smiled.\r\n\r\n\"This one,\" he said, pointing to a DiaBolical, \"I've got it running an\r\nexperimental firmware that lets it print out hollow\r\ncomponents. They're a lot lighter and they don't last as long. But\r\nthey're also way less consumptive on goop. You get about ten times as\r\nmuch printing out of them.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne noted that this bit of news turned both of the Disney execs a\r\nlittle green. They made a lot of money selling goop, she knew.\r\n\r\n\"This one,\" Lester continued, patting a DiaB that was open to the\r\nelements, its imps lounging in its guts, \"we mix some serious epoxy in\r\nwith it, some carbon fibers. The printouts are practically\r\nindestructible. There are some kids around here who've been using it\r\nto print parts for bicycles --\"\r\n\r\n\"Those were printed on *this*?\" Sammy said.\r\n\r\n\"We ran into Francis and his gang,\" Suzanne explained.\r\n\r\nLester nodded. \"Yeah, it's not perfect, though. The epoxy clogs up the\r\nworks and the imps really don't like it. I only get two or three days\r\nout of a printer after I convert it. I'm working on changing the mix\r\nto fix that, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" Guignol noted sourly, \"it's not as if you have to pay for\r\nnew DiaBs when you break one.\"\r\n\r\nLester smiled nastily at him. \"Exactly,\" he said. \"We've got a great\r\nresearch subsidy around here.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol looked away, lips pursed.\r\n\r\n\"This one,\" Lester said, choosing not to notice, \"this one is the\r\nrealization of an age-old project.\" He pointed to the table next to\r\nit, where its imps were carefully fitting together some very fine\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nSammy leaned in close, inspecting their work. After a second, he\r\nhissed like a teakettle, then slapped his knee.\r\n\r\nNow Lester's smile was more genuine. He loved it when people\r\nappreciated his work. \"You figured it out?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're printing DiaBs!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the whole thing,\" Lester said. \"A lot of the logic needs an FPGA\r\nburner. And we can't do some of the conductive elements, either. But\r\nyeah, about 90 percent of the DiaB can be printed in a DiaB.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne hadn't heard about this one, though she remembered earlier\r\nattempts, back in the golden New Work days, the dream of\r\nself-replicating machines. Now she looked close, leaning in next to\r\nSammy, so close she could feel his warm breath. There was something,\r\nwell, *spooky* about the imps building a machine using another one of\r\nthe machines.\r\n\r\n\"It's, what, it's like it's alive, and reproducing itself,\" Sammy\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Don't tell me this never occurred to you,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"Honestly? No. It never did. Mr Banks, you have a uniquely twisted,\r\nfucked up imagination, and I say that with the warmest admiration.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol leaned in, too, staring at it.\r\n\r\n\"It's so obvious now that I see it,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, all the really great ideas are like that,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\nSammy straightened up and shook Lester's hand. \"Thank you for the\r\ntour, Lester. You have managed to simultaneously impress and depress\r\nme. You are one sharp motherfucker.\"\r\n\r\nLester preened and Suzanne suppressed a giggle.\r\n\r\nSammy held his hand up like he was being sworn in. \"I'm dead serious,\r\nman. This is amazing. I mean, we manage some pretty out-of-the-box\r\nthinking at Disney, right? We may not be as nimble as some little\r\nwhacked out co-op, but for who we are -- I think we do a good job.\r\n\r\n\"But you, man, you blow us out of the water. This stuff is just\r\n*crazy*, like it came down from Mars. Like it's from the future.\" He\r\nshook his head. \"It's humbling, you know.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol looked more thoughtful than he had to this point. He and\r\nLester stared at Sammy, wearing similar expressions of bemusement.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go into the apartment,\" Suzanne said. \"We can sit down and have\r\na chat.\"\r\n\r\nThey trooped up the stairs together. Guignol expressed admiration for\r\nthe weird junk-sculptures that adorned each landing, made by a local\r\ncraftswoman and installed by the landlord. They sat around the living\r\nroom and Lester poured iced coffee out of a pitcher in the fridge,\r\ndropping in ice-cubes molded to look like legos.\r\n\r\nThey rattled their drinks and looked uncomfortably at one\r\nanother. Suzanne longed to whip out her computer and take notes, or at\r\nleast a pad, or a camera, but she restrained himself. Guignol looked\r\nsignificantly at Sammy.\r\n\r\n\"Lester, I'm just going to say it. Would you sell your business to us?\r\nThe ride, DiaBolical, all of it? We could make you a very, very rich\r\nman. You and Perry. You would have the freedom to go on doing what\r\nyou're doing, but we'd put it in our production chain, mass-market the\r\nhell out of it, get it into places you've never seen. At its peak, New\r\nWork -- which you were only a small part of, remember -- touched 20\r\npercent of Americans. *90 percent* of Americans have been to a Disney\r\npark. We're a bigger tourist draw than *all of Great Britain.* We can\r\ngive your ideas legs.\"\r\n\r\nLester began to chuckle, then laugh, then he was doubled over,\r\nthumping his thighs. Suzanne shook her head. In just a few short\r\nmoments, she'd gotten used to the idea, and it was growing on her.\r\n\r\nGuignol looked grim. \"It's not a firm offer -- it's a chance to open a\r\ndialogue, a negotiation. Talk the possibility over. A good negotiation\r\nis one where we both start by saying what we want and work it over\r\nuntil we get to the point where we're left with what we both need.\"\r\n\r\nLester wiped tears from his eyes. \"I don't think that you grasp the\r\nabsurdity of this situation, fellas. For starters, Perry will never go\r\nfor it. I mean *never.*\" Suzanne wondered about that. And wondered\r\nwhether it mattered. The two had hardly said a word to each other in\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\"What's more, the rest of the rides will never, never, *never* go in\r\nfor it. That's also for sure.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, what the fuck are you talking about? Me go to work for you?\r\nUs go to work for you? What will you do, stick Mickey in the ride?\r\nHe's already in the ride, every now and again, as you well know. You\r\ngoing to move me up to Orlando?\"\r\n\r\nSammy waggled his head from side to side. \"I have a deep appreciation\r\nfor how weird this is, Lester. To tell you the truth, I haven't\r\nthought much about your ride or this little town. As far as I'm\r\nconcerned, we could just buy it and then turn around and sell it back\r\nto the residents for one dollar -- we wouldn't want to own or operate\r\nany of this stuff, the liability is too huge. Likewise the other\r\nrides. We don't care about what you did *yesterday* -- we care about\r\nwhat you're going to do tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, you're a smart guy. You make stuff that we can't dream of,\r\nthat we lack the institutional imagination to dream of. We need\r\n*that*. What the hell is the point of fighting you, suing you, when we\r\ncan put you on the payroll? And you know what? Even if we throw an\r\nidiotic sum of money at you, even if you never make anything for us,\r\nwe're still ahead of the game if you stop making stuff *against* us.\r\n\r\n\"I'm putting my cards on the table here. I know your partner is going\r\nto be even harder to convince, too. None of this is going to be\r\neasy. I don't care about easy. I care about what's right. I'm sick of\r\nbeing in charge of sabotaging people who make awesome stuff. Aren't\r\nyou sick of being sabotaged? Wouldn't you like to come work some place\r\nwhere we'll shovel money and resources at your projects and keep the\r\nwolves at bay?\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne was impressed. This wasn't the same guy whom Rat-Toothed\r\nFreddy had savaged. It wasn't the same guy that Death Waits had\r\ndescribed. He had come a long way. Even Guignol -- whom, she\r\nsuspected, needed to be sold on the idea almost as much as Lester --\r\nwas nodding along by the end of it.\r\n\r\nLester wasn't though: \"You're wasting your time, mister. That's all\r\nthere is to it. I am not going to go and work for --\" a giggle escaped\r\nhis lips \"-- Disney. It's just --\"\r\n\r\nSammy held his hands up in partial surrender. \"OK, OK. I won't push\r\nyou today. Think about it. Talk it over with your buddy. I'm a patient\r\nguy.\" Guignol snorted. \"I don't want to lean on you here.\"\r\n\r\nThey took their leave, though Suzanne found out later that they'd\r\ntaken a spin around the ride before leaving. Everyone went on the\r\nride.\r\n\r\nLester shook his head at the door behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Can you believe that?\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne smiled and squeezed his hand. \"You're funny about this, you\r\nknow that? Normally, when you encounter a new idea, you like to play\r\nwith it, think it through, see what you can make of it. With this,\r\nyou're not even willing to noodle with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't seriously think that this is a good idea --\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. It's not the dumbest idea I've ever heard. Become a\r\nmillionaire, get to do whatever you want? It'll sure make an\r\ninteresting story.\"\r\n\r\nHe goggled at her.\r\n\r\n\"Kidding,\" she said, thinking, *It would indeed make an interesting\r\nstory, though.* \"But where are you going from here? Are you going to\r\nstay here forever?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perry would never go for it --\" Lester said, then stopped.\r\n\r\n\"You and Perry, Lester, how long do you think that's going to last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you go all Yoko on me, Suzanne. We've got one of those around\r\nhere already --\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like this Yoko joke, Lester. I never did. Hilda doesn't want\r\nto drive Perry away from you. She wants to make the rides work. And it\r\nsounds like that's what Perry wants, too. What's wrong with them doing\r\nthat? Especially if you can get them a ton of money to support it?\"\r\n\r\nLester stared at her, open-mouthed. \"Honey --\"\r\n\r\n\"Think about it, Lester. Your most important virtue is your expansive\r\nimagination. Use it.\"\r\n\r\nShe watched this sink in. It did sink in. Lester listened to her,\r\nwhich surprised her every now and again. Most relationships seemed to\r\nbe negotiations or possibly competitions. With Lester it was a\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nShe gave him a hug that seemed to go on forever.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSammy was glad he was driving. The mood Guignol was in, he'd have\r\nwrecked the car. \"That was *not* the plan, Sammy,\" he said. \"The plan\r\nwas to get the data, talk it over --\"\r\n\r\n\"The first casualty of any battle is the battle-plan,\" Sammy said,\r\nthreading them through the press of tourist busses and commuter cars.\r\n\r\n\"I thought the first casualty was the truth.\"\r\n\r\nThey'd spent too long at the ride, then gotten stuck in the afternoon\r\nrush hour out of Miami. \"That too. Look, I'm proposing to spend a\r\ntenth of the profits from the DiaB on this venture. In any other\r\ncircumstance, I would do it with a *purchase order*. The only reason\r\nit's a big deal is --\"\r\n\r\n\"That it carries enough legal liability to destroy the company. Sammy,\r\ndidn't you listen to Hackelberg?\"\r\n\r\n\"The reason I still work at Disney is that it's the kind of company\r\nwhere the lawyers don't *always* set the agenda.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol drummed his hands on the dashboard. Sammy pulled over and\r\ngassed up. At the next pump was a minivan with Kansas plates. Dad was\r\na dumpy Korean guy, Mom was a dumpy white midwesterner with a\r\ncountry-and-western denim jacket, and the back seat was filled with\r\nvibrating children, two girls and a boy. The kids were screaming and\r\nfighting, the girls trying to draw on the boy's face with\r\ncandy-flavored lipstick and kiddie mascara, the boy squirming mightily\r\nand lashing out at them with his gameboy.\r\n\r\nDad and Mom were having their own heated discussion as Dad gassed up,\r\nSammy eavesdropped enough to hear that they were fighting over Dad's\r\nchoice of taking the toll roads instead of the cheaper, slower\r\nalternative route. The kids were shouting so loud, though --\r\n\r\n\"You keep that up and we're not going to Disney World!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the magic sentence, the litmus test for Disney's currency. As\r\nit rose and fell, so did the efficacy of the threat. If Sammy could,\r\nhe'd take a video of the result every time this was uttered.\r\n\r\nThe kids looked at Dad and shrugged. \"Who cares?\" the eldest sister\r\nsaid, and grabbed the boy again.\r\n\r\nSammy turned to Guignol and waggled his eyebrows. Once he was back in\r\nthe car, he said, \"You know, it's risky doing anything. But riskiest\r\nof all is doing nothing.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol shook his head and pulled out his computer.\r\n\r\nHe spent a lot of time looking at the numbers while Sammy fought\r\ntraffic. Finally he closed his computer, put his head back and shut\r\nhis eyes. Sammy drove on.\r\n\r\n\"You think this'll work?\" Guignol said.\r\n\r\n\"Which part?\r\n\r\n\"You think if you buy these guys out --\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that part. Sure, yeah, slam dunk. They're cheap. Like I say, we\r\ncould make back the whole nut just by settling the lawsuit. The hard\r\npart is going to be convincing them to sell.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Hackelberg.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's your job, not mine.\"\r\n\r\nGuignol slid the seat back so it was flat as a bed. \"Wake me when we\r\nhit Orlando.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nIt took IT three days to get Sammy his computer back. His secretary\r\nmanaged as best as she could, but he wasn't able to do much without\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen he got it back at last, he eagerly downloaded his backlog of\r\nmail. It beggared the imagination. Even after auto-filtering it, there\r\nwere hundreds of new messages, things he had to pay real attention\r\nto. When he was dealing with this stuff in little spurts every few\r\nminutes all day long, it didn't seem like much, but it sure piled up.\r\n\r\nHe enlisted his secretary to help him with sorting and\r\nresponding. After an hour she forwarded one back to him with a bold\r\nred flag.\r\n\r\nIt was from Freddy. He got an instant headache, the feeling halfway\r\nbetween a migraine and the feeling after you bang your head against\r\nthe corner of a table.\r\n\r\n:: Sammy, I'm disappointed in you. I thought we were friends. Why do I\r\nhave to learn about your bizarre plan to buy out Gibbons and Banks\r\nfrom strangers. I do hope you'll give me a comment on the story?\r\n\r\nHe'd left the financials with Guignol, who had been discreetly showing\r\nthem around to the rest of the executive committee in closed door,\r\noff-site meetings. One of them must have blabbed, though -- or maybe\r\nit was a leak at Lester's end.\r\n\r\nHe tasted his lunch and bile as his stomach twisted. It wasn't\r\nfair. He had a real chance of making this happen -- and it would be a\r\nsource of genuine good for all concerned.\r\n\r\nHe got halfway through calling Guignol's number, then put the phone\r\ndown. He didn't know who to call. He'd put himself in an unwinnable\r\nposition. As he contemplated the article that Freddy would probably\r\nwrite, he realized that he would almost certainly lose his job over\r\nthis, too. Maybe end up on the wrong end of a lawsuit. Man, that\r\nseemed to be his natural state at Disney. Maybe he was in the wrong\r\njob.\r\n\r\nHe groaned and thumped himself on the forehead. All he wanted to do\r\nwas have good ideas and make them happen.\r\n\r\nBasically, he wanted to be Lester.\r\n\r\nThen he knew who he had to call.\r\n\r\n\"Ms Church?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're back to that, huh? That's probably not a good sign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sammy, you sound like you're about to pop a testicle. Spit it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I could get a job with Lester?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not joking, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Freddy found out about the buyout offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I'm gonna be in search of employment. All I ever wanted to do was\r\ncome up with cool ideas and execute them --\"\r\n\r\n\"Shush now. Freddy found out about this, huh? Not surprising. He's got\r\na knack for it. It's just about his only virtue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Urgh.\"\r\n\r\n\"However, it's also his greatest failing. I've given this a lot of\r\nthought, since my last run in with Rat-Toothed Freddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You call him that to his face?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. But I look forward to it. Tell you what, give me an hour to\r\ntalk to some people here, and I'll get back to you.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour? \"An hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll keep you squirming for at least that long. He loves to make\r\npeople squirm. It's good journalism -- shakes loose some new\r\ndevelopments.\"\r\n\r\n\"An hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you got a choice?\"\r\n\r\n\"An hour, then.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSuzanne didn't knock on Lester's door. Lester would fall into place,\r\nonce Perry was in.\r\n\r\nShe found him working the ride, Hilda back in the maintenance bay,\r\ntweaking some of the robots. His arm was out of the cast, but it was\r\nnoticeably thinner than his good left arm, weak and pale and flabby.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Suzanne.\" He was formal, like he always was these days, and it\r\nsaddened her, but she pressed on.\r\n\r\n\"Perry, we need to shut down for a while, it's urgent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne, this is a busy time, we just can't shut down --\"\r\n\r\nShe thumped her hand on his lemonade-stand counter. \"Cut it out,\r\nPerry. I have never been an alarmist, you know that. I understand\r\nintimately what it means to shut this place down. Look, I know that\r\nthings haven't been so good between us, between *any* of us, for a\r\nlong time. But I am your dear friend, and you are mine, no matter\r\nwhat's going on at this second, and I'm telling you that you need to\r\nshut this down and we need to talk. Do it, Perry.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave her a long, considering look.\r\n\r\n\"Please?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the little queue of four or five people, pretending not\r\nto eavesdrop, waiting their turn.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, folks, you heard the lady. Family emergency. Um, here --\" He\r\nrummaged under the counter, came up with scraps of paper. \"Mrs\r\nTorrence's tearoom across the street -- they make the best cappuccino\r\nin the hood, and the pastries are all baked fresh. On me, OK?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" Suzanne said. \"Time's short.\"\r\n\r\nShe accompanied him to the maintenance bay and they pulled the doors\r\nshut behind them. Hilda looked up from her robot, wiping her hands on\r\nher shorts. She was really lovely, and the look on her face when she\r\nsaw Perry was pure adoration. Suzanne's heart welled up for the two of\r\nthem, such a perfect picture of young love.\r\n\r\nThen Hilda saw Suzanne, and her expression grew guarded, tense. Perry\r\ntook Hilda's hand.\r\n\r\n\"What's this about, Suzanne?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Let me give this to you in one shot, OK?\" They nodded. She ran it\r\ndown for them. Sammy and Guignol, the postcard and the funny\r\ncircumstances of their visit -- the phone call.\r\n\r\n\"So here's the thing. He wants to buy you guys out. He doesn't want\r\nthe ride or the town. He just wants -- I don't know -- the\r\n*creativity*. The PR win. He wants peace. And the real news is, he's\r\nover a barrel. Freddy's forcing his hand. If we can make that problem\r\ngo away, we can ask for *anything*.\"\r\n\r\nHilda's jaw hung slack. \"You have to be kidding --\"\r\n\r\nPerry shushed her. \"Suzanne, why are you here? Why aren't you talking\r\nto Lester about this? Why hasn't Lester talked to me about this. I\r\nmean, just what the fuck is going on?\"\r\n\r\nShe winced. \"I didn't talk to Lester because I thought he'd be easier\r\nto sell on this than you are. This is a golden opportunity and I\r\nthought that you would be conflicted as hell about it and I thought if\r\nI talked to you first, we could get past that. I don't really have a\r\ndog in this fight, except that I want all parties to end up not hating\r\neach other. That's where you're headed now -- you're melting down in\r\nslow motion. How long since you and Lester had a conversation\r\ntogether, let alone a real meal? How long since we all sat around and\r\nlaughed? Every good thing comes to some kind of end, and then the\r\nreally good things come to a beginning again.\r\n\r\n\"You two *were* the New Work. Lots of people got blisteringly rich off\r\nof New Work, but not you. Here's a chance for you to get what you\r\ndeserve for a change. You solve this -- and you *can* solve it, and\r\nnot just for you, but for that Death kid, you can get him justice that\r\nthe courts will take fifteen years to deliver.\"\r\n\r\nPerry scowled. \"I don't care about money --\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's admirable. I have one other thing; I've been saving it\r\nfor last, waiting to see if you'd come up with it on your own.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is time of the essence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because Freddy's going to out this dirtball --\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do we solve that?\"\r\n\r\nHilda grinned. \"Oh, this part I like.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne laughed. \"Yeah.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"Freddy's good at intelligence gathering, but he's not so good at\r\ndistinguishing truth from fiction. In my view, this presents a\r\nfascinating opportunity. Depending on what we leak to him and how, we\r\ncan turn him into --\"\r\n\r\n\"A laughing stock?\"\r\n\r\n\"A puddle of deliquesced organ meat.\"\r\n\r\nPerry began to laugh. \"You're saying that you think that we should do\r\nthis deal for *spite*?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, that's the size of it,\" Suzanne said.\r\n\r\n\"I love it,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHilda laughed too. Suzanne extended her hand to Perry and he shook\r\nit. Then she shook with Hilda.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go find Lester.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nBy the time the call came, Sammy was ready to explode. He got in a\r\ngolf cart and headed to the Animal Kingdom Lodge, which backed onto\r\nthe safari park portion of the Animal Kingdom. He snuck himself onto\r\nthe roof of the grand hotel, which had a commanding view of the\r\nartificial savanna. He watched a family of giraffes graze, using the\r\nzoom on his phone to resolve the hypnotic patterns of the little\r\ncalf. It calmed him. But the sound of his phone ringing startled him\r\nso much he nearly did a half-gainer off the roof. Heart hammering, he\r\nanswered it.\r\n\r\n\"Is this Sammy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Landon Kettlewell,\" the voice on the other side said. Sammy knew the\r\nname, of course. But he hadn't been expecting a call from him.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Mr Kettlewell.\"\r\n\r\n\"The boys have asked me to negotiate this deal for them. It makes\r\nsense -- it'll be hard to make this happen without my contributions. I\r\nhope you agree.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does make sense,\" Sammy said noncommittally. This wasn't the best\r\nday of his life. The giraffes were moving off, but a flock of cranes\r\nwas wheeling overhead in quiet splendor.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you where we're at. We're going to do a deal with you, a\r\nfair one. But a condition of the deal is that we are going to destroy\r\nFreddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're going to leak him bad intel on the deal. Lots of it. Give him a\r\nwhole story. Wait until he publishes it, and then --\"\r\n\r\nSammy sat down on the roof. This was going to be a long conversation.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nPerry ground his teeth and squeezed his beer. The idea of doing this\r\nin a big group had seemed like a good idea. Dirty Max's was certainly\r\nfull of camaraderie, the smell of roasting meat and the chatter of\r\nnearly a hundred voices. He heard Hilda laughing at something Lester\r\nsaid to her, and there were Kettlewell and his kids, fingers and faces\r\nsticky with sauce.\r\n\r\nLester had set up the projector and they'd hung sheets over one of the\r\nmurals for a screen, and brought out a bunch of wireless speakers that\r\nthey'd scattered around the courtyard. It looked, smelled, sounded,\r\nand tasted like a carnival.\r\n\r\nBut Perry couldn't meet anyone's eye. He just wanted to go home and\r\nget under the covers. They were about to destroy Freddy, which had\r\nalso seemed like a hell of a lark at the time, but now --\r\n\r\n\"Perry.\" It was Sammy, up from Orlando, wearing the classic\r\nMickey-gives-the-finger bootleg tee.\r\n\r\n\"Can you get fired for that?\" Perry pointed.\r\n\r\nSammy shook his head. \"Actually, it's official. I had them produced\r\nlast year -- they're a big seller. If you can't beat 'em...  Here --\"\r\nHe dug in the backpack he carried and pulled out another. \"You look\r\nlike a large, right?\"\r\n\r\nPerry took it from him, held it up. Shrugging, he put down his beer\r\nand skinned his tee, then pulled on the Mickey-flips-the-bird. He\r\nlooked down at his chest. \"It's a statement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you and Lester given any thought to where you're going to\r\nrelocate, after?\"\r\n\r\nPerry drew in a deep breath. \"I think Lester wants to come to\r\nOrlando. But I'm going to go to Wisconsin. Madison.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're what now?\"\r\n\r\nPerry hadn't said anything about this to anyone except\r\nHilda. Something about this Disney exec, it made him want to spill the\r\nbeans. \"I can't go along with this. I'm going to bow out. Do something\r\nnew. I've been in this shithole for what feels like my whole life\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nSammy looked poleaxed. \"Perry, that wasn't the deal --\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I know. But think about this: do you want me there if I hate\r\nit, resent it? Besides, it's a little late in the day to back out.\"\r\n\r\nSammy reeled. \"Christ almighty. Well, at least you're not going to end\r\nup my employee.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis -- who had an uncanny knack for figuring out the right moment\r\nto step into a conversation -- sidled over. \"Nice shirt, Perry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Francis, this is Sammy.\" Francis had a bottle of water and a plate of\r\nribs, so he extended a friendly elbow.\r\n\r\n\"We've met -- showed him the bicycle factory.\"\r\n\r\nSammy visibly calmed himself. \"That's right, you did. Amazing, just\r\namazing.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this is on Sammy,\" Perry said, pointing at the huge barbecue\r\nsmoker, the crowds of sticky-fingered gorgers. \"He's the Disney guy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hence the shirts, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what's the rumpus, exactly?\" Francis asked. \"It's all been\r\nhush-hush around here for a solid week.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we're about to find out,\" Perry said, nodding at the gigantic\r\nscreen, which rippled in the sultry Florida night-breeze, obscured by\r\nblowing clouds of fragrant smoke. It was lit up now, showing CNNfn,\r\ntwo pan-racial anchors talking silently into the night.\r\n\r\nThe speakers popped to life and gradually the crowd noises\r\ndimmed. People moved toward the screen, all except Francis and Perry\r\nand Sammy, who hung back, silently watching the screen.\r\n\r\n\"-- guest on the show is Freddy Niedbalski, a technology reporter for\r\nthe notorious British technology publication *Tech Stink*. Freddy has\r\nagreed to come on *Countdown* to break a story that will go live on\r\n*Tech Stink*'s website in about ten minutes.\" The camera zoomed out to\r\nshow Freddy, sitting beside the anchor desk in an armchair. His paunch\r\nwas more pronounced than it had been when Perry had seen him in\r\nMadison, and there was something wrong with his makeup, a color\r\nmismatch that made him look like he'd slathered himself with\r\nMan-Tan. Still, he was grinning evilly and looking like he could\r\nbarely contain himself.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Tania-Luz, it's a pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, take us through the story. You've been covering it for a long\r\ntime, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. This is about the so-called 'New Work' cult, and its\r\naftermath. I've broken a series of scandals involving these characters\r\nover the years -- weird sex, funny money, sweatshop labor. These are\r\nthe people who spent all that money in the New Work bubble, and then\r\nwent on to found an honest-to-God slum that they characterized as a\r\n'living laboratory.'\" -- out came the sarcastic finger-quotes -- \"but,\r\nas near as anyone can work out was more of a human subject experiment\r\ngone mad. They pulled off these bizarre stunts with the help of some\r\nof the largest investment funds on the planet.\"\r\n\r\nPerry looked around at the revellers. They were chortling, pointing at\r\neach other, mugging for the camera. Freddy's words made Perry\r\nuncomfortable -- maybe there was something to what he said. But there\r\nwas Francis, unofficial mayor of the shantytown, smiling along with\r\nthe rest. They hadn't been perfect, but they'd left the world a better\r\nplace than they'd found it.\r\n\r\n\"There are many personalities in this story, but tonight's installment\r\nhas two main players: a venture capitalist named Landon Kettlewell and\r\na Disney Parks senior vice president called Sammy Page. Technically,\r\nthese two hate each others' guts --\" Sammy and Kettlewell toasted each\r\nother through the barbecue smoke. \"But they've been chumming up to one\r\nanother lately as they brokered an improbable deal to shaft everyone\r\nelse in the sordid mess.\"\r\n\r\n\"A deal that you've got details on for us tonight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. My sources have turned up reliable memos and other\r\nintelligence indicating that the investors behind the shantytown are\r\nabout to *take over Disney Parks*. It all stems from a lawsuit that\r\nwas brought on behalf of a syndicate of operators of bizarre,\r\ntrademark infringing rides that were raided off the backs of\r\ncomplaints from Disney Parks. These raids, and a subsequent and very\r\nsuspicious beating of an ex-Disney Park employee, led to the creation\r\nof an investment syndicate to fund a monster lawsuit against Disney\r\nParks, one that could take the company down.\r\n\r\n\"The investment syndicate found an unlikely ally in the person of\r\nSammy Page, the senior VP from Disney Parks, who worked with them to\r\npush through a plan where they would settle the lawsuit in exchange\r\nfor a controlling interest in Disney Parks.\"\r\n\r\nThe anchors looked suitably impressed. Around the screen, the partiers\r\nhad gone quiet, even the kids, mesmerized by Freddy's giant head, eyes\r\nrolling with irony and mean humor.\r\n\r\n\"And that's just for starters. The deal required securing the\r\ncooperation of the beaten-up ex-Disney employee, who goes by the name\r\nof 'Death Waits' -- no, really! -- and *he* required that he be made a\r\nvice president of the new company as well, running the 'Fantasyland'\r\nsection of the Florida park. In the new structure, the two founders of\r\nthe New Work scam, Perry Gibbons and Lester Banks are to oversee the\r\nDisneyfication of the activist rides around the country, selling out\r\ntheir comrades, who signed over control of their volunteer-built\r\nenterprises as part of the earlier lawsuit.\"\r\n\r\nThe male anchor shook his head. \"If this is true, it's the strangest\r\nturn in American corporate history.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" Freddy said. \"These people are like some kind of poison, a\r\ndisease that affects the judgement of all those around them --\"\r\n\r\n\"If it's true,\" the male anchor continued, as if Freddy hadn't\r\nspoken. \"But is it? Our next guest denies all of this, and claims that\r\nMr Niedbalski has his facts all wrong. Tjan Lee Tang is the chairman\r\nof Massachusetts Ride Theorists, a nonprofit that operates three of\r\nthe spin-off rides in New England. He is in our Boston\r\nstudios. Welcome, Mr Tang.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy's expression was priceless: a mixture of raw terror and\r\ncontempt. He tried to cover it, but only succeeded in looking\r\nconstipated. On the other half of the split-screen, Tjan beamed\r\nsunnily at them.\r\n\r\n\"Hi there!\" he said. \"Greetings from the blustery Northeast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr Tang, you've heard what our guest has to say about the latest\r\ndevelopments in the extraordinary story of the rides you helped\r\ncreate. Do you have any comment?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly do. Freddy, old buddy, you've been had. Whomever your\r\nleak was in Disney, he was putting you on. There is not one single\r\nword of truth to anything you had to say.\" He grinned wickedly. \"So\r\nwhat else is new?\"\r\n\r\nFreddy opened his mouth and Tjan held up one hand. \"No, wait, let me\r\nfinish. I know it's your schtick to come after us this way, you've\r\nbeen at it for years. I think it's because you have an unrequited\r\ncrush on Suzanne Church.\r\n\r\n\"Here's what's really happening. Lester Banks and Perry Gibbons have\r\ntaken jobs with Disney Parks as part of a straightforward\r\ndeal. They're going to do research and development there, and Disney\r\nis settling its ongoing lawsuit with us with a seventy million dollar\r\ncash settlement. Half goes to the investors. Some of the remainder\r\nwill go to buy the underlying titles to the shantytown and put them in\r\na trust to be managed by a co-operative of residents. The rest is\r\ngoing into another trust that will be disbursed in grants to people\r\noperating rides around the country. There's a non-monetary part of the\r\ndeal, too: all rides get a perpetual, worldwide license on all Disney\r\ntrademarks for use in the rides.\"\r\n\r\nThe announcers smiled and nodded.\r\n\r\n\"We think this is a pretty good win. The rides go on. The shantytown\r\ngoes on. Lester and Perry get to do great work in a heavily resourced\r\nlab environment.\"\r\n\r\nTania-Luz turned to Freddy. \"It seems that your story is in\r\ndispute. Do you have further comment?\"\r\n\r\nFreddy squirmed. A streak of sweat cut through his pancake makeup as\r\nthe camera came in for a closeup. \"Well, if this is true, I'd want to\r\nknow why Disney would make such a generous offer --\"\r\n\r\n\"Generous?\" Tjan said. He snorted. \"We were asking for *eight billion*\r\nin punitive damages. They got off easy!\"\r\n\r\nFreddy acted like he hadn't heard. \"Unless the terms of this so-called\r\ndeal are published and subject to scrutiny --\"\r\n\r\n\"We posted them about five minutes ago. You could have just asked us,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy's eyes bugged out. \"We have no way of knowing whether what this\r\nman is saying is true --\"\r\n\r\n\"Actually, you do. Like I say, it's all online. The deals are\r\nsigned. Securities filings and everything.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy got up out of his seat. \"*Would you shut up and let me\r\nfinish?*\" he screamed.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, sorry,\" Tjan said with a chuckle. He was enjoying this way too\r\nmuch. \"Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what about Death Waits? He's been a pawn all along in this game\r\nyou've played with other people's lives. What happens to him as you\r\nall get rich?\"\r\n\r\nTjan shrugged. \"He got a large cash settlement too. He seemed pretty\r\nhappy about it --\"\r\n\r\nFreddy was shaking. \"You can't just sell off your lawsuit --\"\r\n\r\n\"We were looking to get compensated for bad acts. We got compensated\r\nfor them, and we did it without tying up the public courts. Everybody\r\nwins.\" He cocked his head. \"Except you, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"This was a fucking ambush,\" Freddy said, pointing his fingers at the\r\ntwo coiffed and groomed anchors, who shied away dramatically, making\r\nhim look even crazier. He stormed off the stage, cursing, every word\r\ntransmitted by his still-running wireless mic. He shouted at an\r\ninvisible security guard to get out of his way. Then they heard him\r\nmake a phone-call, presumably to his editor, shouting at him to kill\r\nthe article, nearly weeping in frustration. The anchors and Tjan\r\npasted on unconvincing poker-faces, but around the BBQ pit, it was all\r\nhowls of laughter, which turned to shrieks when Freddy finally figured\r\nout that he was still on a live mic.\r\n\r\nPerry and Sammy locked eyes and grinned. Perry ticked a little salute\r\noff his forehead at Sammy and hefted his tee. Then he turned on his\r\nheel and walked off into the night, the fragrant smell of the barbecue\r\nsmoke and the sound of the party behind him.\r\n\r\nHe parked his car at home and trudged up the stairs. Hilda had packed\r\nher suitcase that morning. He had a lot more than a suitcase's worth\r\nof stuff around the apartment, but as he threw a few t-shirts --\r\nincluding his new fake bootleg Mickey tee -- and some underwear in a\r\nbag, he suddenly realized that he didn't care about any of it.\r\n\r\nThen he happened upon the baseball glove. The cloud of old leather\r\nsmell it emitted when he picked it up made tears spring into his\r\neyes. He hadn't cried through any of this process, though, and he\r\nwasn't about to start now. He wiped his eyes with his forearm and\r\nreverently set the glove into his bag and shut it. He carried both\r\nbags downstairs and put them in the trunk, then he drove to just a\r\nlittle ways north of the ride and called Hilda to let her know he was\r\nready to go.\r\n\r\nShe didn't say a word when she got in the car, and neither did he, all\r\nthe way to Miami airport. He took his frisking and secondary screening\r\nin stoic silence, and once they were seated on the Chicago flight, he\r\nput his head down on Hilda's shoulder and she stroked his hair until\r\nhe fell asleep.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nEpilogue\r\n\r\nLester was in his workshop when Perry came to see him. He had the yoga\r\nmat out and he was going through the slow exercises that his\r\nphysiotherapist had assigned to him, stretching his crumbling bones\r\nand shrinking muscles, trying to keep it all together. He'd fired\r\nthree physios, but Suzanne kept finding him new ones, and (because she\r\nloved him) prettier ones.\r\n\r\nHe was down on all fours, his ass stuck way up in the air, when Perry\r\ncame through the door. He looked back through his ankles and squinted\r\nat the upside-down world. Perry's expression was carefully neutral,\r\nthe same upside-down as it would be right-side-up. He grunted and went\r\ndown to his knees, which crackled like popcorn.\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't sound good,\" Perry remarked mildly.\r\n\r\n\"Funny man,\" Lester said. \"Get over here and help me up, will you?\"\r\n\r\nPerry went down in a crouch before him. There was something funny\r\nabout his eye, the whole side of his head. He smelled a little sweaty\r\nand a little gamy, but the face was the one Lester knew so well. Perry\r\nheld out his strong, leathery hands, and after a moment, Lester\r\ngrasped them and let Perry drag him to his feet.\r\n\r\nThey stood facing one another for an uncomfortable moment, hands\r\nclasped together. Then Perry flung his arms wide and shouted, \"Here I\r\nam!\"\r\n\r\nLester laughed and embraced his old friend, not seen or heard from\r\nthese last 15 years.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nLester's workshop had a sofa where he entertained visitors and took\r\nhis afternoon nap. Normally, he'd use his cane to cross from his\r\nworkbench to the sofa, but seeing Perry threw him for such a loop that\r\nhe completely forgot until he was a pace or two away from it and then\r\nhe found himself flailing for support as his hips started to give\r\nway. Perry caught him under the shoulders and propped him up. Lester\r\nfelt a rush of shame color his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Steady there, cowboy,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, sorry,\" Lester muttered.\r\n\r\nPerry lowered him to the sofa, then looked around. \"You got anything\r\nto drink? Water? I didn't really expect the bus would take as long as\r\nit did.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're taking the bus around Burbank?\" Lester said. \"Christ, Perry,\r\nthis is Los Angeles. Even homeless people drive cars.\"\r\n\r\nPerry looked away and shook his head. \"The bus is cheaper.\" Lester\r\npursed his lips. \"You got anything to drink?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the fridge,\" Lester said, pointing to a set of nested clay pot\r\nevaporative coolers. Perry grinned at the jury-rigged cooler and\r\nrummaged around in its mouth for a while. \"Anything, you know, buzzy?\r\nGuarana? Caffeine, even?\"\r\n\r\nLester gave an apologetic shrug. \"Not me, not anymore. Nothing goes\r\ninto my body without oversight by a team of very expensive\r\nnutritionists.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't look so bad,\" Perry said. \"Maybe a little skinny --\"\r\n\r\nLester cut him off. \"Not bad like the people you see on TV, huh? Not\r\nbad like the dying ones.\" The fatkins had overwhelmed the nation's\r\nhospitals in successive waves of sickened disintegrating skeletons\r\nwhose brittle bones and ruined joints had outstripped anyone's ability\r\nto cope with them. The only thing that kept the crisis from boiling\r\nover entirely was the fast mortality that followed on the first\r\nsymptoms -- difficulty digesting, persistent stiffness. Once you\r\ncouldn't keep down high-calorie slurry, you just starved to death.\r\n\r\n\"Not like them,\" Perry agreed. He had a bit of limp, Lester saw, and\r\nhis old broken arm hung slightly stiff at his side.\r\n\r\n\"I'm doing OK,\" Lester said. \"You wouldn't believe the medical bills,\r\nof course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let Freddy know you've got the sickness,\" Perry said. \"He'd\r\nlove that story -- 'fatkins pioneer pays the price --'\"\r\n\r\n\"Freddy! Man, I haven't thought of that shitheel in -- Christ, a\r\ndecade, at least. Is he still alive?\"\r\n\r\nPerry shrugged. \"Might be. I'd think that if he'd keeled over someone\r\nwould have asked me to pitch in to charter a bus to go piss on his\r\ngrave.\"\r\n\r\nLester laughed hard, so hard he hurt his chest and had to sag back\r\ninto the sofa, doing deep yoga breathing until his ribs felt better.\r\n\r\nPerry sat down opposite him on the sofa with a bottle of Lester's\r\nspecial thrice-distilled flat water in a torpedo-shaped\r\nbottle. \"Suzanne?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" Lester said. \"Spends about half her time here and half on the\r\nroad. Writing, still.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's she on to now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cooking, if you can believe it. Molecular gastronomy -- food hackers\r\nwho use centrifuges to clarify their consomme. She says she's never\r\neaten better. Last week it was some kid who'd written a genetic\r\nalgorithm to evolve custom printable molecules that can bridge two\r\nunharmonius flavors to make them taste good together -- like, what do\r\nyou need to add to chocolate and sardines to make them freakin'\r\ndelicious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there such a molecule?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suzanne says there is. She said that they misted it into her face\r\nwith a vaporizer while she ate a sardine on a slab of dark chocolate\r\nand it tasted better than anything she'd ever had before.\"\r\n\r\n\"OK, that's just wrong,\" Perry said. The two of them were grinning at\r\neach other like fools.\r\n\r\nLester couldn't believe how good it felt to be in the same room as\r\nPerry again after all these years. His old friend was much older than\r\nthe last time they'd seen each other. There was a lot of grey in his\r\nshort hair, and his hairline was a lot higher up his forehead. His\r\nknuckles were swollen and wrinkled, and his face had deep lines,\r\nmaking him look carved. He had the leathery skin of a roadside\r\nhomeless person, and there were little scars all over his arms and a\r\nfew on his throat.\r\n\r\n\"How's Hilda?\" Lester asked.\r\n\r\nPerry looked away. \"That's a name I haven't heard in a while,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Yowch. Sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that's OK. I get email blasts from her every now and again. She's\r\nchipper and scrappy as always. Fighting the good fight. Fatkins stuff\r\nagain -- same as when I met her. Funny how that fight never gets old.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardy har har,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"OK, we're even,\" Perry said. \"One-one on the faux-pas master's\r\ntournament.\"\r\n\r\nThey chatted about inconsequentialities for a while, stories about\r\nLester's life as the closeted genius at Disney Labs, Perry's life on\r\nthe road, getting itinerant and seasonal work at little\r\nmicro-factories.\r\n\r\n\"Don't they recognize you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me? Naw, it's been a long time since I got recognized. I'm just the\r\nguy, you know, he's handy, keeps to himself. Probably going to be\r\nmoving on soon. Good with money, always has a quiet suggestion for\r\ntweaking an idea to make it return a little higher on the investment.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's you, all right. All except the 'keeps to himself' part.\"\r\n\r\n\"A little older, a little wiser. Better to keep your mouth shut and be\r\nthought a fool than to open it and remove all doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mister Twain. You and Huck been on the river a while\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"No Huck,\" he said. His smile got sad, heartbreakingly sad. This\r\nwasn't the Perry Lester knew. Lester wasn't the same person,\r\neither. They were both broken. Perry was alone, though -- gregarious\r\nPerry, always making friends. Alone.\r\n\r\n\"So, how long are you staying?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm just passing through, buddy. I woke up in Burbank this morning\r\nand I thought, 'Shit, Lester's in Burbank, I should say hello.' But I\r\ngot places to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, man, stay a while. We've got a guest-cottage out back, a\r\nlittle mother-in-law apartment. There are fruit trees, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Living the dream, huh?\" He sounded unexpectedly bitter.\r\n\r\nLester was embarrassed for his wealth. Disney had thrown so much stock\r\nat him in the beginning and Suzanne had sold most of it and wisely\r\ninvested it in a bunch of micro-funds; add to that the money she was\r\nraking in from the affiliate sites her Junior Woodchucks --\r\nkid-reporters she'd trained and set up in business -- ran, and they\r\nnever had to worry about a thing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, apart from dying. And working here.\" As soon as the words were\r\nout of his mouth, he wished he could take them back. He never let on\r\nthat he wasn't happy at the Mouse, and the dying thing -- well,\r\nSuzanne and he liked to pretend that medical science would cure what\r\nit had brought.\r\n\r\nPerry, though, he just nodded as if his suspicions were\r\nconfirmed. \"Must be hard on Suzanne.\"\r\n\r\nNow that was hitting the nail on the head. \"You always were a\r\nperceptive son of a bitch.\"\r\n\r\n\"She never said fatkins was good for you. She just reported the\r\nstory. The people who blame her --\"\r\n\r\nThis was the elephant in the room whenever Lester and Suzanne talked\r\nabout his health. Between the two of them, they'd popularized fatkins,\r\nsent millions winging to Russia for the clinics, fuelled the creation\r\nof the clinics in the US and Mexico.\r\n\r\nBut they never spoke of it. Never. Now Perry was talking about it,\r\nstill talking:\r\n\r\n\"-- the FDA, the doctors. That's what we pay them for. The way I see\r\nit, you're a victim, their victim.\"\r\n\r\nLester couldn't say anything. Words stoppered themselves up in his\r\nmouth like a cork. Finally, he managed to choke out, \"Change the\r\nsubject, OK?\"\r\n\r\nPerry looked down. \"Sorry. I'm out of practice with people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you'll stay with us,\" he said, thinking *I hope you leave soon\r\nand never come back*.\r\n\r\n\"You miss it, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said working here --\"\r\n\r\n\"Working here. They said that they wanted me to come in and help them\r\nturn the place around, help them reinvent themselves. Be nimble. Shake\r\nthings up. But it's like wrestling a tar-baby. You push, you get\r\nstuck. You argue for something better and they tell you to write a\r\nreport, then no one reads the report. You try to get an experimental\r\nservice running and no one will reconfigure the firewall. Turn the\r\nplace around?\" He snorted. \"It's like turning around a battleship by\r\ntapping it on the nose with a toothpick.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate working with assholes.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're not assholes, that's the thing, Perry. They're some really\r\nsmart people. They're nice. We have them over for dinner. They're fun\r\nto eat lunch with. The thing is, *every single one of them feels the\r\nsame way I do*. They *all* have cool shit they want to do, but they\r\ncan't do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's like an emergent property. Once you get a lot of people under\r\none roof, the emergent property seems to be crap. No matter how great\r\nthe people are, no matter how wonderful their individual ideas are,\r\nthe net effect is shit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reminds me of reliability calculation. Like if you take two\r\ncomponents that are 90 percent reliable and use them in a design, the\r\noutcome is 90 percent of 90 percent -- 81 percent. Keep adding 90\r\npercent reliable components and you'll have something that explodes\r\nbefore you get it out of the factory.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe people are like that. If you're 90 percent non-bogus and ten\r\npercent bogus, and you work with someone else who's 90 percent\r\nnon-bogus, you end up with a team that's 81 percent non-bogus.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like that model. It makes intuitive sense. But fuck me, it's\r\ndepressing. It says that all we do is magnify each others' flaws.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe that's the case. Maybe flaws are multiplicative.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what are virtues?\"\r\n\r\n\"Additive, maybe. A shallower curve.\"\r\n\r\n\"That'd be an interesting research project, if you could come up with\r\nsome quantitative measurements.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what do you do around here all day?\"\r\n\r\nLester blushed.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm building bigger mechanical computers, mostly. I print them out\r\nusing the new volumetrics and have research assistants assemble\r\nthem. There's something soothing about them. I have an Apple ][+ clone\r\nrunning entirely on physical gates made out of extruded plastic\r\nskulls. It takes up an entire building out on one of the lots and when\r\nyou play Pong on it, the sound of the jaws clacking is like listening\r\nto corpse beetles skeletonizing an elephant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I'd like to see that,\" Perry said, laughing a little.\r\n\r\n\"That can be arranged,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\nThey were like gears that had once emerged from a mill with perfectly\r\nprecise teeth, gears that could mesh and spin against each other,\r\ntransferring energy.\r\n\r\nThey were like gears that had been ill-used in machines, apart from\r\neach other, until their precise teeth had been chipped and bent, so\r\nthat they no longer meshed.\r\n\r\nThey were like gears, connected to one another and mismatched,\r\nclunking and skipping, but running still, running still.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nPerry and Lester rode in the back of the company car, the driver an\r\nold Armenian who'd fled Azerbaijan, whom Lester introduced as\r\nKapriel. It seemed that Lester and Kapriel were old friends, which\r\nmade sense, since Lester couldn't drive himself, and in Los Angeles,\r\nyou didn't go anywhere except by car. The relationship between a man\r\nand his driver would be necessarily intimate.\r\n\r\nPerry couldn't bring himself to feel envious of Lester having a\r\nchauffeured car, though it was clear that Lester was embarrassed by\r\nthe luxury. It was too much like an invalid's subsidy to feel\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\n\"Kap,\" Lester said, stirring in the nest of paper and parts and empty\r\nhealth-food packages that he'd made of the back-seat.\r\n\r\nKapriel looked over his shoulder at them. \"Home now?\" He barely had an\r\naccent, but when he turned his head, Perry saw that one ear had been\r\nbadly mangled, leaving behind a misshapen fist of scar.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Lester said. \"Let's eat out tonight. How about Musso and Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ms Suzanne says --\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't need to tell her,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\nPerry spoke in a low voice, \"Lester, I don't need anything\r\nspecial. Don't make yourself sick --\"\r\n\r\n\"Perry, buddy, shut the fuck up, OK? I can have a steak and a beer and\r\na big-ass dessert every now and again. Purified medicated fatkins-chow\r\ngets old. My colon isn't going to fall out of my asshole in terror if\r\nI send a cheeseburger down there.\"\r\n\r\nThey parked behind Musso and Frank and let the valet park the town\r\ncar. Kapriel went over to the Walk of Fame to take pictures of the\r\nrobotic movie stars doing acrobatic busking acts, and they went into\r\nthe dark cave of the restaurant, all dark wood, dark carpets, pictures\r\nof movie stars on the walls. The maitre d' gave them a look, tilted\r\nhis head, looked again. Calmly, Lester produced a hundred-dollar bill\r\nand slid it across the podium.\r\n\r\n\"We'd like Orson Welles's table, please,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe maitre d' -- an elderly, elegant Mexican with a precise spade\r\nbeard -- nodded affably. \"Give me five minutes, gentlemen. Would you\r\ncare to have a drink in the bar?\"\r\n\r\nThey sat at the long counter and Perry ordered a Scotch and\r\nsoda. Lester ordered water, then switched his order to beer, then\r\nnon-alcoholic beer, then beer again. \"Sorry,\" he said to the\r\nwaitress. \"Just having an indecisive kind of night, I guess.\"\r\n\r\nPerry tried to figure out if Lester had been showing off with the\r\nc-note, and decided that he hadn't been. He'd just gone native in LA,\r\nand a hundred for the maitre d' when you're in a hurry can't be much\r\nfor a senior exec.\r\n\r\nLester sipped gingerly at his beer. \"I like this place,\" he said,\r\nwaving the bottle at the celebrity caricatures lining the walls. \"It's\r\nperfect Hollyweird kitsch. Celebrities who usually eat out in some\r\nultra-modern place come here. They come because they've always come --\r\nto sit in Orson Welles's booth.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's the food?\"\r\n\r\n\"Depends on what you order. The good stuff is great. You down for\r\nsteaks?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm down for whatever,\" Perry said. Lester was in his medium here,\r\nletting the waiter unfold his napkin and lay it over his lap without\r\ntaking any special notice of the old man.\r\n\r\nThe food was delicious, and they even got to glimpse a celebrity,\r\nthough neither Perry nor Lester knew who the young woman was, nor what\r\nshe was famous for. She was surrounded by children who came over from\r\nother tables seeking autographs, and more than one patron snapped a\r\nsemi-subtle photo of her.\r\n\r\n\"Poor girl,\" Perry said with feeling.\r\n\r\n\"It's a career decision here. You decide to become famous because you\r\nwant that kind of life. Sometimes you even kid yourself that it'll\r\nlast forever -- that in thirty years, they'll come into Musso and\r\nFrank and ask for Miss Whatshername's table. Anyone who wants to know\r\nwhat stardom looks like can find out -- and no one becomes a star by\r\naccident.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think?\" Perry said. \"I mean, we were celebs, kind of, for a while\r\nthere --\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you saying that that happened by accident?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never set out to get famous --\"\r\n\r\n\"You took part in a national movement, Perry. You practically\r\n*founded* it. What did you think was going to happen --\"\r\n\r\n\"You're saying that we were just attention whores --\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Perry, no. We weren't *just* attention whores. We were attention\r\nwhores *and* we built and ran cool shit. There's nothing wrong with\r\nbeing an attention whore. It's an attention economy. If you're going\r\nto be a working stiff, you should pick a decent currency to get paid\r\nin. But you can't sit there and tell me that it didn't feel good,\r\ndidn't feel *great* to have all those people looking up to us,\r\nfollowing us into battle, throwing themselves at us --\"\r\n\r\nPerry held up his hands. His friend was looking more alive than he had\r\nat any time since Perry had been ushered into his workshop. He sat up\r\nstraight, and the old glint of mischief and good humor was in his eye.\r\n\r\n\"I surrender, buddy, you're right.\" They ordered desserts, heavy\r\n\"diplomat puddings\" -- bread pudding made with cake and cherries, and\r\nLester dug in, after making Perry swear not to breathe a word of it to\r\nSuzanne. He ate with such visible pleasure that Perry felt like a\r\nvoyeur.\r\n\r\n\"How long did you say you were in town for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm just passing through,\" Perry said. He had only planned on maybe\r\nseeing Lester long enough for lunch or something. Now it seemed a\r\nforegone conclusion that he'd be put up in the \"guest cottage.\" He\r\nthought about getting back on the road. There was a little gang in\r\nOregon that made novelty school supplies, they were always ramping up\r\nfor their busy season at this time of year. They were good people to\r\nwork for.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, where you got to be? Stay a week. I'll put you on the\r\npayroll as a consultant. You can give lunch-hour talks to the R&D\r\nteam, whatever you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lester, you just got through telling me how much you hate your job\r\n--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the beauty of contracting -- you don't stick around long\r\nenough to hate it, and you never have to worry about the org\r\nchart. Come on, pal --\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll think about it.\"\r\n\r\nLester fell asleep on the car ride home, and Kapriel didn't mind if\r\nPerry didn't want to chat, so he just rolled his windows down and\r\nwatched the LA lights scream past as they hit the premium lanes on the\r\ncrosstown freeways, heading to Lester's place in Topanga Canyon. When\r\nthey arrived, Lester roused himself heavily, clutched his stomach,\r\nthen raced for the house. Kapriel shook his head and rolled his eyes,\r\nthen showed Perry to the front door and shook his hand.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nIn the morning, he prowled Lester and Suzanne's place like a\r\nburglar. The guesthouse had once served as Lester's workshop and it\r\nhad the telltale leavings of a busy inventor -- drawers and tubs of\r\nparts, a moldy coffee-cup in a desk-drawer, pens and toys and unread\r\npostal spam in piles. What it didn't have was a kitchen, so Perry\r\nhelped himself to the key that Lester had left him with the night\r\nbefore and wandered around the big house, looking for the kitchen.\r\n\r\nIt turned out to be on the second floor, a bit of weird architectural\r\ndesign that was characteristic of the place, which had started as a\r\nshack in the hills on several acres of land and then grown and grown\r\nas successive generations of owners had added extensions, seismic\r\nretrofitting, and new floors.\r\n\r\nPerry found the pantries filled with high-tech MREs, each\r\nnutritionally balanced and fortified in ways calculated to make Lester\r\nas healthy as possible. Finally, he found a small cupboard clearly\r\ndevoted to Suzanne's eating, with boxes of breakfast cereal and, way\r\nin the back, a little bag of Oreos. He munched thoughtfully on the\r\ncookies while drinking more of the flat, thrice-distilled water.\r\n\r\nHe heard Lester totter into a bathroom on the floor above, and called\r\n\"Good morning,\" up a narrow, winding staircase.\r\n\r\nLester groaned back at him, a sound that Perry hadn't heard in years,\r\nthat theatrical oh-my-shit-it's-another-day sound.\r\n\r\nHe clomped down the stairs with his cane, wearing a pair of\r\nboxer-shorts and rubber slippers. He was gaunt, the hair on his sunken\r\nchest gone wiry grey, and the skin around his torso sagged. From the\r\nneck down, he looked a hundred years old. Perry looked away.\r\n\r\n\"Morning, bro,\" Lester said, and took a vacuum-sealed pouch out of a\r\nmedical white box over the sink, tore it open, added purified water,\r\nand put it in the microwave. The smell was like wet cardboard in a\r\ndumpster. Perry wrinkled his nose.\r\n\r\n\"Tastes better than it smells. Or looks,\" Lester said. \"Very easy on\r\nthe digestion. Which I need. Never let me pig out like that again,\r\nOK?\"\r\n\r\nHe collapsed heavily into a stool and closed his sunken eyes. Without\r\nopening them, he said, \"So, are you in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I in?\"\r\n\r\n\"You going to come on board as my consultant?\"\r\n\r\n\"You were serious about that, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perry, they can't fire me. If I quit, I lose my health bennies, which\r\nmeans I'll be broke in a month. Which puts us at an impasse. I'm past\r\nfeeling guilty about doing nothing much all day long, but that doesn't\r\nmean I'm not bored.\"\r\n\r\n\"You make it sound so attractive.\"\r\n\r\n\"You got something better to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm in.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSuzanne came home a week later and found them sitting up in the living\r\nroom. They'd pushed all the furniture up against the walls and covered\r\nthe floor with board-game boards, laid edge-to-edge or\r\noverlapping. They had tokens, cards and money from several of the\r\ngames laid out around the rims of the games.\r\n\r\n\"What the blistering fuck?\" she said good naturedly. Lester had told\r\nher that Perry was around, so she'd been prepared for something odd,\r\nbut this was pretty amazing, even so. Lester held up a hand for\r\nsilence and rolled two dice. They skittered across the floor, one of\r\nthem slipping through the heating-grating.\r\n\r\n\"Three points,\" Perry said. \"One for not going into the grating, two\r\nfor going into the grating.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought we said it was two points for not going into the grating,\r\nand one for dropping it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's call it 1.5 points for each.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" Suzanne said, \"I believe I asked a question? To wit,\r\n'What the blistering fuck --'\"\r\n\r\n\"Calvinball,\" Lester said. \"Like in the old Calvin and Hobbes\r\nstrips. The rules are, the rules can never be the same twice.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you're supposed to wear a mask,\" Perry said. \"But we kept\r\nstepping on the pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"No peripheral vision,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"Caucus race!\" Perry yelled, and took a lap around the world. Lester\r\nstruggled to his feet, then flopped back down.\r\n\r\n\"I disbelieve,\" he said, taking up two ten-sided dice and rolling\r\nthem. \"87,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Fine,\" Perry said. He picked up a Battleship board and said, \"B7,\"\r\nand then he said, \"What's the score, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Orange to seven,\" Lester said.\r\n\r\n\"Who's orange?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shit. OK, let's take a break.\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne tried to hold in her laughter, but she couldn't. She ended up\r\ndoubled over, tears streaming down her face. When she straightened up,\r\nLester hobbled to her and gave her a surprisingly strong welcome-home\r\nhug. He smelled like Lester, like the man she'd shared her bed with\r\nall these years.\r\n\r\nPerry held out his hand to her and she yanked him into a long, hard\r\nhug.\r\n\r\n\"It's good to have you back, Perry,\" she said, once she'd kissed both\r\nhis cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"It's fantastic to see you, Suzanne,\" he said. He was thinner than she\r\nremembered, with snow on the roof, but he was still handsome as a\r\npirate.\r\n\r\n\"We missed you. Tell me everything you've been up to.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not interesting,\" he said. \"Really.\"\r\n\r\n\"I find that difficult to believe.\"\r\n\r\nSo he told them stories from the road, and they were interesting in a\r\nkind of microcosm sort of way. Stories about interesting characters\r\nhe'd met, improbable meals he'd eaten, bad working conditions,\r\nmemorable rides hitched.\r\n\r\n\"So that's it?\" Suzanne said. \"That's what you've done?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's what I do,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"And you're happy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sad,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head involuntarily. Perry stiffened.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong with not sad?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing wrong with it, Perry. I'm --\" she faltered, searched\r\nfor the words. \"Remember when I first met you, met both of you, in\r\nthat ghost mall? You weren't just happy, you were hysterical. Remember\r\nthe Boogie-Woogie Elmos? The car they drove?\"\r\n\r\nPerry looked away. \"Yeah,\" he said softly. There was a hitch in his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"All I'm saying is, it doesn't have to be this way. You could --\"\r\n\r\n\"Could what?\" he said. He sounded angry, but she thought that he was\r\njust upset. \"I could go work for Disney, sit in a workshop all day\r\nmaking crap no one cares about? Be the wage-slave for the end of my\r\ndays, a caged monkey for some corporate sultan's zoo?\" The phrase was\r\nLester's, and Suzanne knew then that Perry and Lester had been talking\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nLester, leaning heavily against her on the sofa (they'd pushed it back\r\ninto the room, moving aside pieces of the Calvinball game), made a\r\nwarning sound and gave her knee a squeeze. Aha, definitely territory\r\nthey'd covered before then.\r\n\r\n\"You two have some of the finest entrepreneurial instincts I've ever\r\nencountered,\" she said. Perry snorted.\r\n\r\n\"What's more, I've never seen you happier than you were back when I\r\nfirst met you, making stuff for the sheer joy of it and selling it to\r\ncollectors. Do you know how many collectors would pony up for an\r\noriginal Gibbons/Banks today? You two could just do that forever --\"\r\n\r\n\"Lester's medical --\"\r\n\r\n\"Lester's medical nothing. You two get together on this, you could\r\nmake so much money, we could buy Lester his own hospital.\" *Besides,\r\nLester won't last long no matter what happens*. She didn't say it, but\r\nthere it was. She'd come to grips with the reality years ago, when his\r\nsymptoms first appeared -- when *all* the fatkins' symptoms began to\r\nappear. Now she could think of it without getting that hitch in her\r\nchest that she'd gotten at first. Now she could go away for a week to\r\nwork on a story without weeping every night, then drying her eyes and\r\ncalling Lester to make sure he was still alive.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not saying you need to do this to the exclusion of everything\r\nelse, or forever --\" *there is no forever for Lester* \"-- but you two\r\nwould have to be insane not to try it. Look at this board-game thing\r\nyou've done --\"\r\n\r\n\"Calvinball,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\n\"Calvinball. Right. You were made for this. You two make each other\r\nbetter. Perry, let's be honest here. You don't have anything better to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nShe held her breath. It had been years since she'd spoken to Perry,\r\nyears since she'd had the right to say things like that to him. Once\r\nupon a time, she wouldn't have thought twice, but now --\r\n\r\n\"Let me sleep on it,\" Perry said.\r\n\r\nWhich meant no, of course. Perry didn't sleep on things. He decided to\r\ndo things. Sometimes he decided wrong, but he'd never had trouble\r\ndeciding.\r\n\r\nThat night, Lester rubbed her back, the way he always did when she\r\ncame back from the road, using the hand-cream she kept on her\r\nend-table. His hands had once been so *strong*, mechanic's hands,\r\nstubby-fingered pistons he could drive tirelessly into the knots in\r\nher back. Now they smoothed and petted, a rub, not a massage. Every\r\ntime she came home, it was gentler, somehow more loving. But she\r\nmissed her massages. Sometimes she thought she should tell him not to\r\nbother anymore, but she was afraid of what it would mean to end this\r\nritual -- and how many more rituals would end in its wake.\r\n\r\nIt was the briefest backrub yet and then he slid under the covers with\r\nher. She held him for a long time, spooning him from behind, her face\r\nin the nape of his neck, kissing his collar bone the way he liked, and\r\nhe moaned softly.\r\n\r\n\"I love you, Suzanne,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"What brought that on?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just good to have you home,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to have been taking pretty good care of yourself while I was\r\naway, getting in some Perry time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I took him to Musso and Frank,\" he said. \"I ate like a pig.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you paid the price, didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. For days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Serves you right. That Perry is *such* a bad influence on my boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll miss him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think he'll go, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know he will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, honey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some wounds don't heal,\" he said. \"I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure it's not that,\" Suzanne said. \"He loves you. I bet this is\r\nthe best week he's had in years.\"\r\n\r\n\"So why wouldn't he want to stay?\" Lester's voice came out in the\r\npetulant near-sob she had only ever heard when he was in extreme\r\nphysical pain. It was a voice she heard more and more often lately.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he's just afraid of himself. He's been on the run for a long\r\ntime. You have to ask yourself, what's he running from? It seems to me\r\nthat he's spent his whole life trying to avoid having to look himself\r\nin the eye.\"\r\n\r\nLester sighed and she squeezed him tight. \"How'd we get so screwed\r\nup?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, baby,\" she said, \"we're not screwed up. We're just people who\r\nwant to do things, big things. Any time you want to make a difference,\r\nyou face the possibility that you'll, you know, make a\r\ndifference. It's a consequence of doing things with consequences.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gak,\" he said. \"You always get so Zen-koan when you're on the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gives me time to reflect. Were you reading?\"\r\n\r\n\"Was I reading? Suzanne, I read your posts whenever I feel\r\nlonely. It's kind of like having you home with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're sweet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you really eat sardines on sorbet toast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't knock it. It's better than it sounds. Lots better.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can keep it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to Mr Musso and Frank -- boy, you've got no business\r\ncriticizing anyone else's food choices.\"\r\n\r\nHe heaved a happy sigh. \"I love you, Suzanne Church.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a good man, Lester Banks.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nPerry met them at the breakfast table the next morning as Suzanne was\r\nfiddling with the espresso machine, steaming soy milk for her\r\nlatte. He wore a pair of Lester's sloppy drawstring pants and a\r\nt-shirt for a motorcycle shop in Kansas City that was spotted with old\r\nmotor-oil stains.\r\n\r\n\"Bom dia,\" he said, and chucked Lester on the shoulder. He was\r\ncarrying himself with a certain stiffness, and Suzanne thought, *Here\r\nit comes; he's going to say goodbye. Perry Gibbons, you bastard.*\r\n\r\n\"Morning,\" Lester said, brittle and chipper.\r\n\r\nPerry dug around on Suzanne's non-medicated food-shelf for a while and\r\ncame up with a bagel for the toaster and a jar of peanut butter. No\r\none said anything while he dug around for the big bread knife, found\r\nthe cutting board, toasted the bagel, spread peanut butter, and took a\r\nbite. Suzanne and Lester just continued to eat, in uncomfortable\r\nsilence. *Tell him,* Suzanne urged silently. *Get it over with, damn\r\nyou.*\r\n\r\n\"I'm in,\" Perry said, around a mouthful of bagel, looking away.\r\n\r\nSuzanne saw that he had purple bags under his eyes, like he hadn't\r\nslept a wink all night.\r\n\r\n\"I'm staying. If you'll have me. Let's make some stuff.\"\r\n\r\nHe put the bagel down and swallowed. He looked back at Lester and the\r\ntwo old comrades locked eyes for a long moment.\r\n\r\nLester smiled. \"All right!\" He danced a shuffling step, mindful of his\r\nsore hips. \"All right, buddy, *fuckin' A*! Yeah!\"\r\n\r\nSuzanne tried to fade then, to back out of the room and let them do\r\ntheir thing, but Lester caught her arm and drew her into an embrace,\r\ntugging on her arm with a strength she'd forgotten he had.\r\n\r\nHe gave her a hard kiss. \"I love you, Suzanne Church,\" he\r\nsaid. \"You're my savior.\"\r\n\r\nPerry made a happy sound behind her.\r\n\r\n\"I love you, too, Lester,\" she said, squeezing his skinny, brittle\r\nback.\r\n\r\nLester let go of her and she turned to face Perry. Tears pricked his\r\neyes, and she found that she was crying too. She gave him a hug, and\r\nfelt the ways that his body had changed since she'd held him back in\r\nFlorida, back in some forgotten time. He was thicker, but still solid,\r\nand he smelled the same. She put her lips close to his ear and\r\nwhispered, \"You're a good man, Perry Gibbons.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nLester gave his notice that morning. Though it was 8PM in Tehran when\r\nLester called, Sammy was at his desk.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you telling me this, Lester?\"\r\n\r\n\"It says in my contract that I have to give my notice to you,\r\nspecifically.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why the hell did I put that there?\" Sammy's voice sounded far away --\r\nnot just in Iran. It sounded like he had travelled through time, too.\r\n\r\n\"Politics, I think,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Hard to remember. Probably wanted to be sure that someone like Wiener\r\nwouldn't convince you to quit, switch companies, and hire you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much risk of that now,\" Lester said. \"Let's face it, Sammy, I\r\ndon't actually do anything for the company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope. That's right. We're not very good at making use of people like\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, email me your paperwork and I'll shove it around. How much\r\nnotice are you supposed to give?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three months'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yowch. Whatever. Just pack up and go home. Gardening leave.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been two years since Lester'd had any contact with Sammy, but\r\nit was clear that running Iranian ops had mellowed him out. Harder to\r\nget into trouble with women there, anyway.\r\n\r\n\"How's Iran treating you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Middle East operation is something else, boy. You'd like it\r\nhere. The post-war towns all look like your squatter city -- the\r\ncraziest buildings you ever saw. They love the DiaBs though -- we get\r\nthe most fantastic designs through the fan channels....\" He trailed\r\noff. Then, with a note of suspicion: \"What are you going to do now?\"\r\n\r\nAh. No sense in faking it. \"Perry and I are going to go into business\r\ntogether. Making kinetic sculptures. Like the old days.\"\r\n\r\n\"No *way*! Perry *Gibbons*? You two are back together? Christ, we're\r\nall doomed.\" He was laughing. \"Sculptures -- like that toast robot?\r\nAnd he wants to go into *business*? I thought he was some kind of\r\nCommie.\"\r\n\r\nLester had a rush of remembrance, the emotional memory of how much\r\nhe'd hated this man and everything he stood for. What had happened to\r\nhim over the years that he counted this sneak, this thug, as his\r\ncolleague? What had he sold when he sold out?\r\n\r\n\"Perry Gibbons,\" Lester said, and drew in a breath. \"Perry Gibbons is\r\nthe sharpest entrepreneur I've ever met. He can't *help* but make\r\nbusinesses. He's an artist who anticipates the market a year ahead of\r\nthe curve. He could be a rich man a hundred times over if he\r\nchose. Commie? Page, you're not fit to keep his books.\"\r\n\r\nThe line went quiet, the eerie silence of a net-connection with no\r\npackets routing on it. \"Goodbye, Lester,\" Sammy said at length.\r\n\r\nLester wanted to apologize. He wanted *not* to want to apologize. He\r\nswallowed the apology and disconnected the line.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nWhen it was time for bed, Suzanne shut her lid and put the computer\r\ndown beside the sofa. She stepped carefully around the pieces of the\r\nCalvinball game that still covered the living room floor and stepped\r\ninto a pair of slippers. She slid open the back door and hit the\r\nswitch for the yard's flood-light. The last thing she wanted to do was\r\ntrip into the pool.\r\n\r\nShe picked her way carefully down the flagstones that led to the\r\nworkshop, where the lights burned merrily in the night. There was no\r\nmoon tonight, and the stars were laid out like a bag of synthetic\r\ndiamonds arrayed on a piece of black velour in a street market stall.\r\n\r\nShe peered through the window before she went around to the door, the\r\njournalist in her wanting to fix an image of the moment in her mind\r\nbefore she moved in and disturbed it. That was the problem with being\r\na reporter -- everything changed the instant you started reporting on\r\nit. By now, there wasn't a person alive who didn't know what it means\r\nto be in the presence of a reporter. She was a roving Panopticon.\r\n\r\nThe scene inside the workshop was eerie. Perry and Lester stood next\r\nto each other, cheek by jowl, hunched over something on the\r\nworkbench. Perry had a computer open in front of him, and he was\r\ntyping, Lester holding something out of sight.\r\n\r\nHow many times had she seen this tableau? How many afternoons had she\r\nspent in the workshop in Florida, watching them hack a robot, build a\r\nsculpture, turn out the latest toy for Tjan's amusement, Kettlewell's\r\nenrichment? The postures were identical -- though their bodies had\r\nchanged, the hair thinner and grayer. Like someone had frozen one of\r\nthose innocent moments in time for a decade, then retouched it with\r\nwizening makeup and hair-dye.\r\n\r\nShe must have made a noise, because Lester looked up -- or maybe it\r\nwas just the uncanny, semi-psychic bond between an old married\r\ncouple. He grinned at her like he was ten years old and she grinned\r\nback and went around to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, boys,\" she said. They straightened up, both of them\r\nunconsciously cradling their low backs, and she suppressed a grin. *My\r\nlittle boys, all grown up*.\r\n\r\n\"Darling!\" Lester said. \"Come here, have a look!\"\r\n\r\nHe put his arm over her shoulders and walked her to the bench, leaning\r\non her a little.\r\n\r\nIt was in pieces, but she could see where it was going: a pair of\r\nfamiliar boxy shapes, two of Lester's mechanical computers, their\r\ncola-can registers spilling away in a long daisy-chain of worm-gears\r\nand rotating shafts. One figure was big and round-shouldered like a\r\nvintage refrigerator. The other was cockeyed, half its gears set\r\nhigher than the other half. Each had a single, stark mechanical arm\r\nextended before it, and at the end of each arm was a familiar cracked\r\nand fragrant baseball glove.\r\n\r\nLester put a ball into one of the gloves and Perry hammered away at\r\nthe keyboard. Very, very slowly, the slope-shouldered robot drew its\r\nmechanical arm back -- \"We used one of the open-source prosthestic\r\nplans,\" Lester whispered in the tense moment. Then it lobbed a soft\r\nunderhand toss to the lopsided one.\r\n\r\nThe ball arced through the air and the other bot repositioned its arm\r\nin a series of clattering jerks. It seemed to Suzanne that the ball\r\nwould miss the glove and bounce off of the robot's carapace, and she\r\nwinced. Then, at the very last second, the robot repositioned its arm\r\nwith one more fast jerk, and the ball fell into the pocket.\r\n\r\nA moment later, the lopsided bot -- Perry, it was Perry, that was easy\r\nto see -- tossed the ball to the round-shouldered one, who was clearly\r\nher Lester, as she'd first known him. Lester-bot caught the ball with\r\na similar series of jerks and returned the volley.\r\n\r\nIt was magic to watch the robots play their game of catch. Suzanne was\r\nmesmerized, mouth open. Lester squeezed her shoulder with uncontained\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nThe Lester-bot lobbed one to Perry-bot, but Perry-bot flubbed the\r\ntoss. The ball made a resounding gong sound as it bounced off of\r\nPerry-bot's carapace, and Perry-bot wobbled.\r\n\r\nSuzanne winced, but Lester and Perry both dissolved in gales of\r\nlaughter. She watched the Perry-bot try to get itself re-oriented,\r\naligning its torso to face Lester-bot and she saw that it *was* funny,\r\nvery funny, like a particularly great cartoon.\r\n\r\n\"They do that on purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly -- but there's no way they're going to be perfect, so we\r\nbuilt in a bunch of stuff that would make it funnier when it\r\nhappened. It is now officially a feature, not a bug.\" Perry glowed\r\nwith pride.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it bad for them to get beaned with a baseball?\" she asked as\r\nLester carefully handed the ball to Perry-bot, who lobbed it to\r\nLester-bot again.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yeah. But it's kind of an artistic statement,\" Perry said,\r\nlooking away from them both. \"About the way that friendships always\r\nwear you down, like upper and lower molars grinding away at each\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nLester squeezed her again. \"Over time, they'll knock each other\r\napart.\"\r\n\r\nTears pricked at Suzanne's eyes. She blinked them away. \"Guys, this is\r\ngreat.\" Her voice cracked, but she didn't care. Lester squeezed her\r\ntighter.\r\n\r\n\"Come to bed soon, hon,\" she said to Lester. \"I'm going away again\r\ntomorrow afternoon -- New York, a restaurant opening.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be right up,\" Lester said, and kissed the top of her head. She'd\r\nforgotten that he was that tall. He didn't stand all the way up.\r\n\r\nShe went to bed, but she couldn't sleep. She crossed to the window and\r\ndrew back the curtain and looked out at the backyard -- the scummy\r\nswimming pool she kept forgetting to do something about, the heavy\r\ngrapefruit and lemon trees, the shed. Perry stood on the shed's stoop,\r\nlooking up at the night sky. She pulled the curtains around herself an\r\ninstant before he looked up at her.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met and he nodded slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" she mouthed silently.\r\n\r\nHe blew her a kiss, stuck out a foot, and then bowed slightly over his\r\noutstretched leg.\r\n\r\nShe let the curtain fall back into place and went back to bed. Lester\r\nclimbed into bed with her a few minutes later and spooned up against\r\nher back, his face buried in her neck.\r\n\r\nShe fell asleep almost instantly.\r\n\r\n$$$$\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nThanks to Andrew Leonard and Salon for publishing this when it was\r\n*Themepunks*.\r\n\r\nThanks to Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Irene Gallo, Pablo Defendini, Justin\r\nGolenbock, Liz Gorinksy, Tom Doherty and the many wonderful people at\r\nTor for their good work putting this book into the world.\r\n\r\nLikewise thanks to Sarah Hodgson, Alice Moss and Victoria Barnsley at\r\nHarperCollins for making this book happen in the UK.\r\n\r\nThanks to my agents, Russell Galen, Danny Baror and Justin Manask.\r\n\r\nThanks to my mother, Dr Roslyn Doctorow, who remains the sharpest\r\nproofer in the business.\r\n\r\nThanks to my business partners at Boing Boing, the staff of MAKE:\r\nMagazine, and to all the makers who let me hold their skateboards\r\nwhile they welded the killer robots.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks, of course, to Alice and Poesy, who are the reason for all\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n$$$$",
