The home apple-tree]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPLE-TREE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWHERE THERE IS NO APPLE-TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wind is snapping in the bamboos, knocking together the resonant\r\ncanes and weaving the myriad flexile wreaths above them. The palm\r\nheads rustle with a brisk crinkling music. Great ferns stand in the\r\nedge of the forest, and giant arums cling their arms about the trunks\r\nof trees and rear their dim jacks-in-the-pulpit far in the branches;\r\nand in the greater distance I know that green parrots are flying in\r\ntwos from tree to tree. The plant forms are strange and various,\r\nmaking mosaic of contrasting range of leaf-size and leaf-shape, palm\r\nand grass and fern, epiphyte and liana and clumpy mistletoe, of grace\r\nand clumsiness and even misproportion, a tall thick landscape all\r\nmingled into a symmetry of disorder that charms the attention and\r\nfascinates the eye.\r\n\r\nIt is a soft and delicious air wherein I sit. A torrid drowse is in\r\nthe receding landscape. The people move leisurely, as befits the world\r\nwhere there is no preparation for frost and no urgent need of\r\nlaborious apparel. There are tardy bullock-carts, unconscious donkeys,\r\nand men pushing vehicles. There are odd products and unaccustomed\r\ncakes and cookies on little stands by the roadside, where the turbaned\r\nvendor sits on the ground unconcernedly.\r\n\r\nThere are strange fruits in the carts, on the donkeys that move down\r\nthe hillsides from distant plantations in the heart of the jungle, on\r\nthe trees by winding road and thatched cottage, in the great crowded\r\nmarkets in the city. I recognize coconuts and mangoes, star-apples and\r\ncustard-apples and cherimoyas, papayas, guavas, mamones, pomegranates,\r\nfigs, christophines, and the varied range of citrus fruits. There are\r\nalso great polished apples in the markets, coming from cooler regions,\r\ntied by their stems, good to look at but impossible to relish; and I\r\nunderstand how these people of the tropics think the apple an inferior\r\nfruit, so successfully do the poor varieties stop the desire for more.\r\nThere are vegetables I have never seen before.\r\n\r\nI am conscious of a slowly moving landscape with people and birds and\r\nbeasts of burden and windy vegetation, of prospects in which there are\r\nno broad smooth farm fields with fences dividing them, of scenery full\r\nof herbage, in which every lineament and action incite me and\r\nstimulate my desire for more, of days that end suddenly in the\r\nblackness of night.\r\n\r\nYet, somehow, I look forward to the time when I may go to a more\r\naccustomed place. Either from long association with other scenes or\r\nbecause of some inexpressible deficiency in this tropic splendor, I am\r\nnot satisfied even though I am exuberantly entertained. Something I\r\nmiss. For weeks I wondered what single element I missed most. Out of\r\nthe numberless associations of childhood and youth and eager manhood\r\nit is difficult to choose one that is missed more than another. Yet\r\none day it came over me startlingly that I missed the apple-tree,--the\r\napple-tree, the sheep, and the milch cattle!\r\n\r\nThe farm home with its commodious house, its greensward, its great\r\nbarn and soft fields and distant woods, and the apple-tree by the\r\nwood-shed; the good home at the end of the village with its sward and\r\nshrubbery, and apple roof-tree; the orchard, well kept, trim and\r\napple-green, yielding its wagon-loads of fruits; the old tree on the\r\nhillside, in the pasture where generations of men have come and gone\r\nand where houses have fallen to decay; the odor of the apples in the\r\ncellar in the cold winter night; the feasts around the fireside,--I\r\nthink all these pictures conjure themselves in my mind to tantalize me\r\nof home.\r\n\r\nAnd often in my wanderings I promise myself that when I reach home I\r\nshall see the apple-tree as I had never seen it before. Even its bark\r\nand its gnarly trunk will hold converse with me, and its first tiny\r\nleaves of the budding spring will herald me a welcome. Once again I\r\nshall be a youth with the apple-tree, but feeling more than the\r\nturbulent affection of transient youth can understand. Life does not\r\nseem regular and established when there is no apple-tree in the yard\r\nand about the buildings, no orchards blooming in the May and laden in\r\nthe September, no baskets heaped with the crisp smooth fruits; without\r\nall these I am still a foreigner, sojourning in a strange land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE APPLE-TREE IN THE LANDSCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe April sun is soft on the broad open fenced fields, waking them\r\ngently from the long deep sleep of winter. Little rills are running\r\nfull. The grass is newly coolly green. Fresh sprouts are in the sod.\r\nBy copse and highway the shad-bushes salute with their handkerchiefs.\r\nApple-trees show tips of verdure. It is good to see the early greens\r\nof changing spring. It is good to look abroad on an apple-tree\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\nAs to its vegetation, the landscape is low and flat, not tall. There\r\nis a vast uniformity in plant forms, a subdued and constrained\r\nhumility. A month later the leafage will be in glory, but that also\r\nwill have an aspect of sameness and moderation. Perhaps the actual\r\nvariety of species will be greater than in many parts of the abounding\r\ntropics, and to the careful observer the luxuriance will be as great,\r\nalthough not so big; but as I look abroad I am impressed with the\r\neconomy of the prospect. It comes nearer to my powers of assimilation,\r\nquiets me with a deep satisfaction; the contrasts are subdued, the\r\nprocesses grade into each other imperceptibly in the land of the\r\nlingering twilight.\r\n\r\nIn this prospect are maples and elms and apple-trees. The maples and\r\nelms are of the fields and roadsides. The apple-trees are of human\r\nhabitations and human labor; they cluster about the buildings, or\r\nstand guard at a gate; they are in plantations made by hands. As I see\r\nthem again, I wonder whether any other plant is so characteristically\r\na home-tree.\r\n\r\nSo is the apple-tree, even when full grown, within the reach of\r\nchildren. It can be climbed. Little swings are hung from the branches.\r\nIts shade is low and familiar. It bestows its fruit liberally to all\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nThe apple is a sturdy tree. Short of trunk and short of continuous\r\nlimb, it is yet a stout and rugged object, the indirectness of its\r\nbranching branches adding to its picturesque quality. It is a tree of\r\ngood structure. Although its limbs eventually arch to the ground, if\r\nleft to themselves, they yet have great strength. The angularity of\r\nthe branching, the frequent forking, the big healing or hollow knots\r\nwith rounding callus-lips, give the tree character. Anywhere it would\r\nbe a marked tree, unlike any other.\r\n\r\nThe bark on the older surface sheds in short oblong irregular scales\r\nor plates that detach perhaps at both ends and often at the sides,\r\nclinging by the middle until the curl loosens them and they fall to\r\nthe ground. These plates or chips are more or less rowed up and down\r\nthe trunk and on the larger branches, yet the apple bark is not ridged\r\nand furrowed as on the elm. The bark is not checked in squares as on\r\nold pear-trees nor peeling as on cherries. In dry weather, the loose\r\nold bark is dark brown-gray, often supporting gray lichens, but in\r\nrain it is soft and nearly black, yielding pleasantly to the touch. In\r\nthe forks, the bark is not so readily cast and there the chips may lie\r\nin heaps. On the young limbs and small trunks the bark is tight and\r\nclose, not splitting into seams or furrows with the expansion of the\r\ncylinder but stretching and throwing off detached flakes and chips.\r\nUnder the chips various insects hide or make some of their\r\ntransformations. There the codlin-moth pupates. The old remains of\r\nscale insects may be found on the exterior. In the furrows about the\r\ndormant buds the eggs of plant-lice pass the winter.\r\n\r\nTo destroy these breeding and hiding places, many careful\r\napple-growers scrape away the loose bark, being careful not to expose\r\nthe quick living tissue; and on the younger wood the eggs of aphis and\r\nother pests, as well as cocoons and nymphs, are destroyed by vigorous\r\nwinter spraying. The regular spraying of apple-trees, in the different\r\nseasons, more or less sterilizes the bark. Many forms of canker, due\r\nto fungi and bacteria, invade the bark, making sunken areas and scars,\r\noften so serious as to destroy the tree. All these features are\r\ndiscoverable in the apple-tree.\r\n\r\nThe trunk of the apple-tree is short and stout, usually not perfectly\r\ncylindrical and not prominently buttressed at the base. In old trees\r\nit is usually ribbed or ridged, sometimes tortuous with spiral-like\r\ngrooves, often showing the bulge where the graft was set. The wood is\r\nfine-grained and of good color, and lends itself well to certain kinds\r\nof cabinet work and to the turning-lathe for household objects; it\r\nshould be better known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2. The apple-tree in the landscape]\r\n\r\nIf left to itself, the tree branches near the ground, making many\r\nstrong secondary scaffold trunks; but the plant does not habitually\r\nhave more than one bole, even though it may branch from the very base;\r\nit is a real tree, even though small, and not a huge shrub. In the\r\nnatural condition, the trunk often rises only a foot or two before\r\nit is lost in the branches; at other times it may be four or six feet\r\nhigh. Under cultivation, the lowest branches are usually removed when\r\nthe tree begins to grow, and an evident clean trunk is produced. In\r\nEurope and the Eastern States, it has been the practice to trim the\r\ntrunk clean to the height of four or six feet; but in hotter and drier\r\nregions the trunk is kept short to insure against sun-scald; and with\r\nthe better tillage implements of the present day it may not be\r\nnecessary to train the heads so high.\r\n\r\nIn old hill pastures, in many parts of the North, one sees curious\r\numbrella forms and other shapes of apple-trees, due to browsing by\r\ncattle. A little tree gets a start in the pasture. When cattle are\r\nturned in, they browse the tender terminal growth. The plant spreads\r\nat the base, in a horizontal direction. With the repeated browsing on\r\ntop, the tree becomes a dense conical mound. Eventually, the leader\r\nmay get a strong headway, and grows beyond the reach of the browsers.\r\nAs it rises out of grasp, it sends off its side shoots, forming a\r\nhead. The cattle browse the under side of this head, as far as they\r\nare able to reach, causing the tree to assume a grotesque hour-glass\r\nshape, flat on the under part of the head, with a cone of green\r\nherbage at the ground. Sometimes pastures are full of little hummocks\r\nof trees that have not yet been able to overtop the grazers.\r\n\r\nThe winter apple-tree in the free is a reassuring object. It has none\r\nof the sleekness of many horticultural forms, nor the fragility of\r\npeaches, sour cherries and plums. It stands boldly against the sky,\r\nwith its elbows at all angles and its scaly bark holding the snow.\r\nAgainst evergreens it shows its ruggedness specially well. It\r\npresents forms to attract the artist. Even when gnarly and broken, it\r\ndoes not convey an impression of decrepitude and decay but rather of a\r\nhardy old character bearing his burdens. In every winter landscape I\r\nlook instinctively for the apple-tree.\r\n\r\nWe are so accustomed to the apple-tree as a part of an orchard, where\r\nit is trimmed into shape and its bolder irregularities controlled,\r\nthat we do not think it has beauty when left to itself to grow as it\r\nwill. An apple-tree that takes its own course, as does a pine-tree or\r\nan oak, is looked on as unkempt and unprofitable and as a sorry object\r\nin the landscape, advertizing the neglect of the owner. Yet if the\r\napple-tree had never borne good fruit, we should plant it for its\r\nbloom and its picturesqueness as we plant a hawthorn or a locust-tree.\r\n\r\nIn winter and in summer, and in the months between, my apple-tree is a\r\ngreat fact. It is a character in the population of my scenery,\r\nstanding for certain human emotions. The tree is a living thing, not\r\nmerely a something that bears apples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE BUDS ON THE TWIGS\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the buds begin to break. The firm winter-buds swell. Their scales\r\npart. Tips of green appear. Tiny leaves come forth, neatly rolled\r\ninward, growing as they expand, the stalks lengthening. Resurrection\r\nis astir in the tree.\r\n\r\nSeveral leaves issue from every bud. From some buds arise only leaves;\r\nfrom others a flower-cluster emerges from the leaf-rosette, showing\r\nfaint color even before it expands. Very close together and tight\r\nthese unopened little flowers are packed as they emerge; if we had\r\nlooked at them with a lens as they lay in the bud in the long winter\r\nwe should understand why; now they escape their bonds and rapidly grow\r\nas they are delivered, yet at first pressed together by head and stem\r\nin their soft gray wool.\r\n\r\nThus are there two kinds of buds on the twig of the bearing\r\napple-tree,--the leaf-buds (sending forth leaves only), and the\r\nflower-buds (bearing both leaves and flowers). And if we wish to\r\nanalyze more closely, we discover two kinds of leaf-buds,--those that\r\nsend forth a rapidly growing shoot bearing the leaves, and those from\r\nwhich the leaf-cluster remains practically sessile on the branch.\r\nThese latter, or the strongest and best of them, will probably give\r\nrise to short fruiting spurs and the others to elongated leafy\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nBefore me as I write is an apple limb more than three feet long. It\r\nhas been a vigorous grower, for it is only three years old. The years\r\ncan be readily made out; there are two sets of \"rings\" separating\r\nthem. You may see these rings on all young apple limbs. They represent\r\nthe scars of the scales of the past terminal buds.\r\n\r\nThree years ago my shoot was sent off from its parent branch; that\r\nyear it grew but four inches, bearing leaves on its sides, in the\r\naxils of which developed buds for the winter and at the end a larger\r\nterminal bud. Let us call this shoot 1918. Two years ago (1919),\r\nwhilst I was in a distant land, the terminal bud gave rise to a shoot\r\nnineteen inches long; two buds near the end of the 1918 shoot pushed\r\nout clusters of leaves and made spurs about one-half inch long; all\r\nthe other buds, five in number, remained dormant, and now they are\r\ndead and are rapidly becoming mere scars. Last year (1920) the\r\nterminal bud of 1919 gave rise to a shoot fifteen inches long; three\r\nbuds at the base of this two-year (1919) shoot remained dormant;\r\nfourteen buds produced spurs. It is now the spring of 1921; the 1920\r\nshoot has four dormant buds at its base, ten rosettes of leaves from\r\nthe other buds, and a pushing terminal shoot.\r\n\r\nOn my branch this year, therefore, are 5 plus 3 plus 4, or 12 dormant\r\nbuds of all the years; 2 plus 14 plus 10, or 26 spurs; 1 terminal bud\r\ncontinuing the onward growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3. The bloom of the apple-tree]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the last two years were good ones for my apple\r\nlimb, for the growths were long (19 and 15 inches) and most of the\r\nbuds produced spurs. The result is evidenced also in the fact that the\r\nlimb is this year laden with potential bloom. On 1918 the two spurs\r\nbear flowers, one of them only a single bloom and the other five\r\nblooms. On 1919 twelve of the fourteen spurs are bearing flowers in\r\nthe following numbers: 5 flowers, 5, 5, 7, 5, 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 = 63\r\nflowers. On 1920 are no spurs bearing flowers, but the terminal bud\r\n(as is frequent on vigorous young trees) bears five flowers. Here,\r\ntherefore, on this yard of three-year-old twig are seventy-four\r\nblossoms.\r\n\r\nBut there will not be seventy-four fruits; some of the flowers are\r\nsmall and weak; others, as the petals fall, show unmistakable signs of\r\nfailing. A few of them show the plump form of an embryo apple: I think\r\nthere are a score of such promises. But I know that others will fail\r\nlater from physiological causes, and others probably from onslaught of\r\ninsects or disease or from accidents. If six fair fruits mature on a\r\nbranch like this, the crop will be good; and probably the branch would\r\nnot have vigor enough to set as many fruit-buds the following year or\r\nto bear as many fruits.\r\n\r\nIt is good to watch the opening of the apple bloom: pink buds swelling\r\nand puffing out each day, the woolly stems elongating, the five\r\noverlapping incurving petals spreading and growing big, the stamens,\r\nabout twenty, straightening up and lengthening their filaments that\r\nare attached on the flower-rim; the big light yellow anthers shedding\r\npollen; the five green styles in the center. In some flowers the\r\nstyles do not develop, and we have one reason why many flowers are\r\nsterile.\r\n\r\nThe flower-clusters differ much among themselves, in size of parts,\r\nnumber of flowers, color; on some trees the flowers appear in advance\r\nof most of the leafage, but usually they are coincident with the\r\nleaves. Sometimes the flower-stems or peduncles are branched, bearing\r\ntwo or three flowers, and in that case there may be a small green leaf\r\nor bract where the fork arises. The placing of the petals in the bud\r\nat the epoch of expansion may differ in two flowers on the same tree.\r\nOne petal may stand guard outside the others and free from them, both\r\nedges uncovered, while the remaining petals are spiral with one edge\r\nunder and one edge over; or there may be two guard petals, one on\r\neither side; or sometimes all the petals may be spiral, one margin\r\nout, one margin in; in some cases all the petals stand free as the\r\nflower is expanding, with no margin interlapping. Sometimes one petal\r\nis missing, and again the petals may be six.\r\n\r\nThis infinite variety within the bonds of so great regularity lends a\r\nsubtle charm to natural objects, that is wholly absent in man's\r\nperfected machine-work. Man aims at uniformity, two and two alike;\r\nnature aims at endless difference, every object or even every member\r\nof an object having its own character. Much of man's energy is\r\nexpended in trying to overcome the diverseness of nature.\r\n\r\nGradually and slowly the flower balloons enlarge and puff themselves\r\nup, the petals standing together at their tips; all the variety is\r\nunited into a harmony of exuberance, color and form; then one day\r\nthere is a shower of genial rain, a warm sun, birds in the air, bees\r\nreleased, grasses soft and lush, and behold! the apple-tree is in\r\nbloom,--a great heavenly mound of white and pink exhaling a faint\r\ndelicious breath. Then the pulses stir, the dogs bark at the edges of\r\nthe wood, the fields call, the scented winds lead on forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE WEEKS BETWEEN THE FLOWER AND THE FRUIT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe petals expand broadly, usually losing most of their pink. The\r\nblade is oblong and rounded at the end, at first cupped and then\r\nnearly flat, three-fourths of an inch long, narrowed at the base into\r\na short stem-like part and usually hairy there, the edges perhaps wavy\r\nbut entire. The expanse of the flower may be one and one-half to two\r\ninches. The brush of stamens, erect in the center, sheds its pollen\r\nand the anthers collapse.\r\n\r\nThen the petals fall, like flakes of snow, borne often by the wind.\r\nThere remain the stout woolly flower-stems an inch or more long and\r\nbearing minute dry bracts, with the young fruit at the summit topped\r\nby the five recurving woolly sepals and the pencil of stamens and\r\nstyles. The bloom being gone, the flowering system of the apple is\r\nthenceforth little observed. Not until the fruit begins to color do we\r\ncome back to the apple-tree to look at it closely; yet in these\r\nintervening weeks some of the most interesting transformations take\r\nplace, and on the exact observance of them depends to a large extent\r\none's success in the rearing and saving of a good crop of apples.\r\n\r\nHere is the flower of the apple-tree (Fig. 3). It is a comely\r\nblossom, fragrant and pinky white, flatly spread to the sky, carrying\r\nthe spirit of the cool of the spring. What concerns us now, however,\r\nis the cluster of stamens and pistils in the center, for these organs\r\nare directly concerned in the production of the fruit. The petals soon\r\nfall, but the remains of these interior organs persist, even unto the\r\nripening of the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe anther is attached at the back of its base or middle to the top of\r\nthe filament in the suture separating the two large cells. These\r\nanther-cells split along the outer margins, releasing the\r\npollen-grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4. Longitudinal section of the flower.]\r\n\r\nIn the center of the ring of stamens are the five style-branches,\r\nwhich are united at the base into a short hairy column; the column is\r\nborne on the ovary, which is sunken deep into the receptacle or stem\r\n(Fig. 4). It is down these style-branches that the pollen-tube passes\r\non its way to the ovules or embryo seeds. The top of the style is\r\nexpanded into a cupped stigma on which are many glutinous points. One\r\ncan observe the browning and ripening of the stigma after pollen has\r\nbeen deposited by wind, bees or other agencies. When the ovules are\r\nfertilized, the forming fruit enlarges regularly unless it meets with\r\nmisfortune or is crowded out for lack of room and nourishment.\r\n\r\nIf one cuts across the ovary or embryo fruit below the recurving\r\nsepals, one will see under a lens that it is neatly five-celled (Fig.\r\n5). In each cell are two ovules; these, if all goes well, will ripen\r\ninto ten seeds. These five cells comprise most of the diameter in the\r\ncross-section: but as the ovary enlarges and the young fruit grows,\r\none may see that the inner part comprising the cells begins to have a\r\ncharacter of its own and to be differentiated from the surrounding\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5. Cross-section of the ovary.]\r\n\r\nThe \"blossom\" falls. In reality only the petals fall. What is left is\r\nwell shown in Fig. 6. Here remain the upstanding stamens with the\r\nempty anthers, and in the center one could see the five styles if the\r\nspecimen were in hand. Here also are the calyx-lobes, widely spreading\r\nand even recurved. The photograph for Fig. 6 was taken May 3. On May\r\n17 another cluster was photographed from the same tree (Fig. 7). Three\r\nof the flowers have produced sturdy young apples. The stems or\r\npedicels have become stouter, and they begin to spread. Note that the\r\ncalyx now is closed, the old stamens protruding, a circumstance that\r\nwill have special significance when we become acquainted with the\r\ncodlin-moth. Note also that one flower has failed, and remains as it\r\nwas two weeks earlier; it will soon fall. The young apples begin to\r\ntake shape. They show a glow of red on the cheek. They are fuzzy all\r\nover. One of them is already injured on one side, having been stung by\r\na curculio or other insect: there are keen senses about the\r\napple-tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6. May 3--When the petals have fallen]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7. May 17--When the young fruits begin to show]\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later (May 31) still another cluster was taken from the same\r\ntree (Fig. 8). Here are three fruits erect on their stems; one of them\r\nis more than an inch in diameter either way, sturdy and unblemished;\r\nanother shows deformity due to insect puncture; the third remains\r\nsmall and presently will drop. A scar in the leaf-axil marks the\r\nfailure of another flower. Four blossoms were in this cluster, but\r\nonly one fruit now has a chance to come to uninjured maturity, and two\r\nhave already failed. The big apple has now lost most of its fuzziness\r\nand begins to assume a delicate \"bloom\" on its surface; the smallest\r\none--the one that soon will perish--still holds some of its fuzz. A\r\nsection of this smallest fruit discloses empty cells; apparently it\r\nwas not fertilized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8. May 31--The success and failure]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 9. June 14--The one big apple]\r\n\r\nAnother two weeks have passed. It is June 14th. From the same tree is\r\ntaken the photograph, Fig. 9. Here is a big apple, 1-1/2 inch in\r\ndiameter; and there is a dead shrivelled fruit that dropped when I\r\ntouched it. Of the several flowers in the cluster, all have failed but\r\none. This one fruit has now passed the danger of the blossom-end\r\ninfection by the codlin-moth and it has no blemishes. The many whitish\r\nspots characteristic of the variety are now conspicuous all over the\r\nsurface. The ribs begin to show. There is a faint blush on the upper\r\nside. The fuzz has disappeared and the bloom is becoming evident. The\r\ncalyx is tightly closed, although the tips of the sepals are spread\r\nwidely. The stem is stout. The weight of the apple inclines it nearly\r\nto the horizontal. Yet this good apple is not symmetrical; one side is\r\nlarger than the other. I cut it crosswise and find two cells on the\r\nlarger side developing two strong seeds each, whilst those on the\r\nsmaller side have a single seed each and one of these seeds is small\r\nand perhaps would not have matured. The fleshy part of the apple,\r\noutside the core, now occupies about as much of the diameter as the\r\ncore itself and much more than one-half the bulk of the fruit.\r\nAlready my apple, now half grown, shows many of its distinctive\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nYet another fortnight has come and gone, and it is June 28th. It has\r\nbeen good \"growing weather.\" Summer is here, full-orbed, regal,\r\nbringing the abundance of the earth. Here are two stout apples hanging\r\non their stems (Fig. 10), for they are now too heavy to be held erect.\r\nThe larger fruit is a trifle more than two inches in diameter. The\r\nfeature spots are now still more prominent on these apples, the ribs\r\nmore pronounced, the blush against the sun more warm. Both these\r\nfruits, from one spur, will mature; but the smaller one will be\r\nblemished, for the apple-scab fungus has established itself on the\r\ncrown and about the calyx. Already the growth is checked in that area,\r\nand the apple looks flattened. There is no evidence in either apple of\r\ncodlin-moth invasion. The adjoining spur, not clearly shown in the\r\nphotograph, is barren; it gave no flowers this year, and it shows no\r\nindication of a blossom-bud for next year. The leaves are thick and\r\nvigorous, yet they bear marks of insect injury and one of them has\r\nbeen extensively skeletonized. On the whole, however, the fruits have\r\nthe mastery, and they now make a brave show.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 10. June 28, and the apples have taken their form]\r\n\r\nJuly has passed this way. Tomorrow it will be August. The odor of\r\napples is now in my tree. There are big striped apples on the ground,\r\nplucked by the wind, the hold loosened by bugs for they too have felt\r\nthe fullness of July. Three apples, one of them three inches through\r\nand two and one-half inches high, and the others nearly as big, hang\r\nat the level of my eyes. You may see them in Fig. 11. Here rises again\r\nmy boyhood spent in an orchard now passed away, as father and mother\r\nhave passed, as playmates have fallen one by one, the old place\r\nholding only memories. Here is my boyhood because the earth is always\r\nyoung and repeats her miracles for the children by my side as it did\r\nfor me so many many years ago. Yet the miracles are greater now than\r\nthey were then. They have more meaning. Now are they part of some\r\ngreat order. They are not separate. Without moving my feet, I lay my\r\nhands on apples, Virginia creeper, asparagus, marigold, sweet sultan,\r\noxalis, plantain, crab-grass, white clover, all growing securely in\r\none place, and everyone like unto itself alone. Here is the\r\neverlasting miracle before my eyes, and all miracles are mysteries.\r\nOnce I thought I should understand such things when I was \"grown up,\"\r\nbut I find myself still a boy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 11. July 31, and the apples are getting ripe]\r\n\r\nThese three apples on the last of the days of July look fair and\r\nsound, partly hidden in the leaves, the deep red colors covering them\r\nin broad splashed stripes and relieved by light dots. Yet when I raise\r\nthe leaves or when I lift the apples apart, I find the burrows of\r\ninsects. They know that these apples are good. It is astonishing how\r\nnature covers up the wounds, how she conceals the sore places, and how\r\nfair she makes everything look. Were it not that she covers the\r\ndepredations of man, the earth would not long remain habitable by him.\r\n\r\nSummer is ended. Today the sun is on the equator, and we are at the\r\nequinox when nights are equal to the days, as the word testifies. The\r\nharvest is over. The apples are no more. Yet the tree still is active\r\nand preparing for another year (Fig. 12). The spurs are now thick and\r\nstout, bearing sturdy hard leaves. The bud in the center is a big\r\none, already recognized as a fruit-bud: here is the promise of\r\nspeckled, furrowed, striped apples next August. Thereby I learn that\r\nit is not enough to be good to the tree in the year in which I desire\r\nits fruit: I must begin the year before, and the year before that, and\r\neven back at the time when the tree is planted; and if the tree at\r\nplanting-time is not a good tree, it will be at a disadvantage perhaps\r\nall its life long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 12. September 22, and the buds are formed for the next\r\nyear's crop]\r\n\r\nFinally the apple is ripe and ready. At the stem end is the \"cavity,\"\r\na depression, deep or shallow, according to variety, in which the stem\r\nis set. At the blossom end is the \"basin,\" also with the\r\ncharacteristics of the variety as to depth and width and contour, in\r\nwhich the calyx-lobes persist, and inside the calyx are the remains of\r\nthe dead stamens and styles; the calyx may be \"closed\" or \"open,\" the\r\ncharacter being a mark of the particular variety.\r\n\r\nCut the apple through the center lengthwise (Fig. 13); note the curved\r\noutline of the core (the pistil) extending half or more across the\r\nfruit; if you do not see this outline, cut an apple until you do;\r\ncarefully open the five cells or compartments and within the parchment\r\nwalls find the two seeds attached by their points which are directed\r\ntoward the stem end; perhaps one of the seeds has failed, but probably\r\na cavity marks its place; perhaps both seeds have failed; perhaps the\r\ncell has more than two seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 13. The apples in section]\r\n\r\nCut an apple cross-wise: note the five radiating cells of the core,\r\nthe number and attachment of the seeds; note the ten points, imbedded\r\nin the flesh, marking the outline of the core. Cut an apple cross-wise\r\nabove the core and beneath it; note where these points vanish and try\r\nto harmonize them with the core-outline as seen in the lengthwise\r\nsection; probably you will discover why you may not see the\r\ncore-outline in all the lengthwise sections you make. Before you leave\r\nthe fruit, note whether single seeds in a cell are the same shape as\r\nthe two seeds in a cell.\r\n\r\nThe flesh outside the core-outline is interpreted to be stem structure\r\nrather than pistil structure. Sometimes an apple bears a scale-like\r\nleaf on its exterior, suggesting that the outer part of the fruit is\r\nstem. The older morphologists interpreted the apple flower to comprise\r\na hollowed calyx (calyx-tube) inside which is the pistil and on the\r\nrim of which are the petals and stamens. The structure now is regarded\r\nas a hollowed receptacle or stem (hypanthium), with the pistil inside,\r\nthe petals and stamens on its rim. We noted in the flower that the\r\novary part of the pistil is solidly imbedded in this receptacle, but\r\nthat the five styles are free. The pear and quince are of similar\r\nstructure, but the peach, plum and cherry are simple ripened pistils.\r\n\r\nHere, in this chapter, we have discovered some of the epochs in the\r\nlife of the apple. Usually we let the imagination run only to the\r\nmature fruit, thinking of the harvest, but in all the weeks before the\r\nharvest the apple has been growing and taking form. As these weeks\r\nhave not been blank to the apple-tree, so shall they not be blank to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE BRUSH PILE\r\n\r\n\r\nToday I visited the brush pile back of the orchard. Here the trimmings\r\nof the winter are placed, waiting to be burned when dry. How many are\r\nthe archives that will be destroyed! Here are histories in every bud\r\nand twig and scar, of the seasons, of the accidents and deaths, the\r\nrecords of the tree as there are records of families.\r\n\r\nThese records are not written in numbers or in letters, nor yet in\r\nhieroglyphs; yet are they understandable. Alphabet is not needed, and\r\nthe key is simple.\r\n\r\nFrom the brush pile of records I took one. I must describe it in part\r\nby a picture (Fig. 14). On the living trees at this writing the petals\r\nmostly have fallen and the leaves are nearly full grown. This branch\r\nwas cut in winter. It has lain in the snow and rain, putting forth no\r\nflowers or leaves. Yet we can read it.\r\n\r\nIt is May, 1921. The terminal shoot is obviously of 1920; we shall\r\nname it No. 1. It is a foot long, smooth and glossy, terminating at\r\nthe base (_o_) in a \"ring\" and at a short stub or branchlet. If we\r\ncount the buds on all sides of the shoot and at the tip we find them\r\nto be 13. The largest one is at the tip, and they are mostly\r\nsuccessively smaller toward the base. Apparently the growth-energy was\r\nexpended in the upper parts of the twig, making large full buds. In\r\nfact, the three or four lowermost buds are scarcely developed and\r\nwould not grow unless the limb were broken off above them; they are\r\ndormant buds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 14. A three-year record.--In a leisure hour, trace the\r\nhistory of these parts; it will open your eyes.]\r\n\r\nLooking along the shoot, I find that every six buds stand in the same\r\nline: the sixth bud is over the first, seventh over the second, eighth\r\nover the third. If I were to fasten a string to bud No. 1 and wind it\r\naround the stem to my left, passing over every bud until I had reached\r\nthe sixth, I should find that it had made two circuits of the stem\r\n(passed twice around it) and had passed over five spaces between buds.\r\nThis is the leaf-arrangement or phyllotaxy of the apple-tree,\r\nexpressed by the fraction 2/5. The space between two buds is\r\ntwo-fifths of a diameter, and two circuits (ten-fifths) must be passed\r\nbefore a bud comes over the one from which we started. The 2/5\r\nleaf-arrangement obtains on cherry, peach, apricot, pear, raspberry\r\nand many others; but a very different order is that of the linden,\r\ngrape, currant, lilies, elm, maple.\r\n\r\nWe cannot understand this simple unbranched terminal twig (No. 1)\r\nuntil we know what took place last year. A year ago, in the spring of\r\n1920, a terminal bud that had formed in 1919 expanded and gave rise to\r\nthis rapidly growing shoot. By the end of May or early June this shoot\r\nhad grown to twelve inches long, for the growth in length on the twigs\r\nof trees is usually completed that early. This shoot bore leaves on\r\nthe 2/5 arrangement; in the axil of every leaf was a bud, the\r\nstrongest buds being with the strongest leaves at the middle and top\r\nof the shoot; in the autumn of 1920 these leaves fell, but the buds\r\nremained, persisted the winter, and were ready to \"grow\" in the early\r\nspring of 1921. We see them on No. 1 (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15. The growing shoot, with a bud in each axil, and a\r\nspur on last year's growth.]\r\n\r\nIn 1921 these buds on No. 1, then, would have grown. New leaves would\r\nhave come from the bud itself; in fact, the winter buds of the apple\r\nare packed with miniature leaves and sometimes with flowers as well.\r\nThe shoot coming out of the bud may remain very short, constituting a\r\n\"spur,\" or grow with long internodes, making a slender twig. Fig. 15\r\nshows a branch with new elongated growth, _b_ to _a_, and a shoot or\r\nspur (_c_) arising from a bud of the previous year. Note the \"ring,\"\r\nor division beyond _b_, marking the turn of the year.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted in Fig. 14 that the buds are of two shapes and sizes,\r\nsuch as _a, a, a_, representing one kind and _b, b_, the other kind.\r\nThe former, small and pointed, are leaf-buds; from them will arise a\r\nshoot bearing only leaves. The latter, _b_, large and rounded and\r\nusually more fuzzy, are flower-buds (fruit-buds): from them will arise\r\na short shoot bearing leaves and a cluster of flowers; and we hope\r\nthat at least one of the flowers will set fruit.\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to resume our lesson with the branch before us. We\r\nhave identified the slender terminal part, No. 1, as the growth of\r\n1920. We are now to account for all the remaining buds and branchlets.\r\n\r\nIf No. 1 grew in 1920, then the main shoot of No. 2 grew in 1919, from\r\nthe point _o o_. It is also one foot long. Near its base are four\r\nsmall buds that remained dormant in 1920. There are nine branches\r\n(_d_) of various lengths besides the terminal shoot No. 1, all of\r\nwhich grew in 1920, for they are naturally a year younger than the\r\nmain axis from which they arise; these branches are the same age as\r\nNo. 1, with buds that would have produced shoots in 1921. But the\r\nterminal buds of eight of these lateral shoots (all but the lowermost)\r\nbear blossom-buds at the end; note their size and shape. Had not the\r\nbranch been cut, these buds would have bloomed in 1921; the eight of\r\nthem would have produced probably forty to fifty flowers; perhaps two\r\nor three good fruits would have resulted. Note that two of the lateral\r\nbranches or spurs are short and weak: these would soon perish. The No.\r\n2 branch has a dead end (_e_); in some way the terminal bud was\r\ndestroyed, and No. 1 sprang from a lateral bud beneath it, changing\r\nthe direction of growth.\r\n\r\nIf No. 2 grew in 1919, then No. 3 grew in 1918. It also grew about one\r\nfoot in length, showing that the conditions in the three years must\r\nhave been very uniform. There are remains of five dormant buds at its\r\nbase. There are seven side branches. As the main axis is three years\r\nold, so these lateral shoots are two years old; they are the same age\r\nas the axis No. 2. The lower one (_s_) grew less than an inch in 1919,\r\nand made a fruit-bud; in 1920 it blossomed and one fruit set as is\r\nshown by the square scar at the end; as the scar is small and the twig\r\nweak, we are safe in assuming that the apple was very small or else\r\ndid not mature. A bud formed at the side of _s_ to continue the growth\r\nof the spur next year (1921), but it is a leaf-bud; apparently there\r\nwas not sufficient energy to bear flowers and to make a fruit-bud; so\r\nthere would have been no more fruit on this spur earlier than 1922:\r\nthus do we see that the alternate bearing of the apple-tree may have\r\nsome of its origin in the fruit-spur.\r\n\r\nThe side spur _f_ produced a terminal blossom-bud in 1919. In 1920 six\r\nflowers opened,--I could count the scars. One of the flowers produced\r\na fruit, as I tell by the square scar at the end; the thickened stem\r\nalso indicates fruit-bearing. The side bud in this case is a\r\nfruit-bud, but it is small and weak and is probably incapable of\r\nproducing a fruit. There are no strong leaf-buds to take up the work,\r\nand this spur (_f_) would probably soon have died, as also would spur\r\n_s_.\r\n\r\nThe side shoot _g_ grew to _h_ in 1919 and made a flower-bud. In 1920\r\nthis bud gave blossoms and one fruit resulted; the scar is prominent\r\nand there is an enlargement of the tissue indicating that the fruit\r\nprobably attained good size; in 1920 also, two side spurs were formed\r\neach with weak blossom-buds, also a terminal shoot (beyond _h_) with\r\nleaf-bud at the end.\r\n\r\nThe other shoots have similar histories: the long shoot _i_ bore a\r\nfruit-bud at _k_ in 1919 and a fruit in 1920; in 1920 it also made\r\nthree lateral shoots and a terminal shoot, with flower-buds\r\nterminating two of them. Shoot _l_ bore flowers at its point in 1920\r\nbut did not carry the fruit to maturity; it also made two side growths\r\nand one terminal growth, all terminated by flower-buds, to be blown in\r\n1921. The shoot _m_ is a short spur that made a flower-bud in 1919 and\r\nin 1920 carried three little fruits for a time and made a flower-bud\r\nin 1920. Shoot _n_ remained very short in 1919, making a terminal\r\nleaf-bud; in 1920 it grew two inches and made a weak flower-bud.\r\n\r\nIf shoot No. 3 grew in 1918, then No. 4 grew in 1917; but the branch\r\nis severed and I cannot trace the record farther. We could trace the\r\nfamily history many years if we had the unpruned tree before us.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in my yard-long manuscript are forty bud-records on the\r\nmain axis, counting the terminals on No. 2 and No. 3. I can find\r\nrecord of 144 buds on the side shoots. This makes a grand total of 184\r\nbuds. There is a total growth in length of 108 inches, or 9 feet. Each\r\nof the buds that has already \"grown\" has produced an average of\r\nprobably ten leaves, or say 340 leaves in total. If there were an\r\naverage of five flowers to the cluster, then about 150 flowers would\r\nhave been carried on my branch, with the potentiality of 150 fruits;\r\nbut in fact not more than three or four maturing fruits would have\r\nbeen produced in these years: and I should think this a good\r\nproportion as blossoms and apples go. Certainly the branch has done\r\nits part. There have been three eventful years.\r\n\r\nI would not have my reader to suppose that one may always distinguish\r\nleaf-buds and fruit-buds at a glance. I may be mistaken in some of the\r\nabove determinations, but they are essentially correct for I have the\r\ntwig before me. In some varieties of apples the differences between\r\nthe two kinds of buds are less marked. The certain way is to dissect\r\nthe bud: one may then see what it contains.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to determine how the branch was placed in the tree. It\r\nmust have been upright or very nearly so, for the main axis is\r\nessentially straight and the branchlets are about equally developed on\r\nall sides; moreover, there is no indication in the bark that one\r\nexposure was the \"weather side.\" The big twig _i_ apparently found a\r\nlight and unoccupied space into which to develop, but its extension is\r\nnot greatly out of proportion. I suppose, however, that my branch was\r\nnot topmost in the tree; there is no indication in very long growth or\r\nstrong upward tendency of the branchlets to mark the branch as a\r\n\"leader.\"\r\n\r\nYears ago I became fascinated with the study of knots and knot-holes\r\nin the timber of wood-piles. They are excellent records of the events\r\nin the life of trees. In print I have tried to show what they mean. I\r\nalso worked out the life-histories of twigs and published them in\r\nnature-study leaflets and elsewhere. Hundreds of children were\r\ninterested in the twigs and buds, finding them unusual, every one of\r\nthem a different story, and yet not difficult to read. These lessons\r\ngave meaning to trees and seasons. Such observations have always meant\r\nmuch to me, even when made in the most casual way in the midst of\r\nconstraining activities. And now in this later day I come back to a\r\nbare twig with all the joy of youth. The records of the years are in\r\nthese piles of brush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE PRUNING OF THE APPLE-TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have found that not all the buds grow. We also know that some of\r\nthe spurs and shoots perish, not alone from accident but from defeat\r\nin the struggle to live. The chances of success are relatively few.\r\nThe pruning process begins early in the life of the tree, and it\r\ncontinues ceaselessly until the end.\r\n\r\nTo the apple-tree in the wild, strict pruning is the assurance of\r\nsuccess. No tree can reach maturity unless more parts perish than are\r\nable to live. The young forest tree has branchlets and leaves along\r\nits side and at the top. All these perish as the trunk rises, often\r\nleaving marks on the bark, curls in the wood, and knot-holes large and\r\nsmall. Thousands of perished buds and branches are the price of a\r\nstraight bole and great clear sheets of boards. Yet these perished\r\nparts bore their burden in their day and time, and contributed to the\r\nultimate success: there could have been no tree without them.\r\n\r\nAny tree-top discloses the pruning in action if one looks intently.\r\nPart of it is recorded in the buds that never put forth a leaf; more\r\nof it in little shoots left behind; and there are large and small\r\nlimbs, dead and dying, yellowing apparently before their time, hanging\r\non till the last hold is broken. Were it not for the benevolent\r\nprocesses of decay, the ground would be strewn with the fallen parts\r\naccumulating through the years.\r\n\r\nIn nature, the great result is to yield abundant quantity of seeds,\r\nthat the species may propagate itself after its kind. Man may desire\r\nfruits relatively few, but large of size and excellent of quality,\r\nwithout spot or blemish; this means greater opportunity and care to\r\nthe single fruit. Pruning is essential, to converge the energy of the\r\nplant into fewer branches, to give the fruits space and light, to\r\nincrease the efficiency of measures for the control of diseases and\r\ninsects. Part of the pruning consists in removing certain branches,\r\nand part of it in eliminating the fruits themselves by the careful\r\nprocess of thinning.\r\n\r\nThe pruning of nature is fortuitous. The tree has the irregularity and\r\nabandon of the picturesque. The pruning of man is for a different end,\r\nand it produces the comely well-proportioned tree of the orchards. The\r\ntree becomes a manipulated subject, comforting to the eye of the\r\nthrifty pomologist.\r\n\r\nBranch-pruning is essentially the removal of superfluous\r\nbranches,--those that crowd, that cross each other, that are so placed\r\nas to be profitless, that are in the way, that are injured or\r\ndiseased. For the most part, the branches should be removed when they\r\nare small; but it is not possible to foresee all that may be needed in\r\nthe training of the tree and, therefore, the frequent advice to prune\r\nonly with a hand-knife cannot be followed. One needs a sharp\r\npruning-saw and sometimes a chisel on a long handle. Usually it is not\r\nnecessary to remove branches more than an inch or one and one-half\r\ninch in diameter if pruning is carefully practiced every year; but\r\nsometimes even well-pruned trees must be shaped, corrected and\r\nimproved by the cutting of larger branches.\r\n\r\nPruning is usually best performed in early spring. The branch should\r\nbe cut close to the main limb or trunk and parallel with it, leaving\r\nno stub; the healing process is then likely to proceed more rapidly.\r\nThe wound should be smooth and clean, without breaks, splinters or\r\nsplits; the knot-holes in logs and trunks are usually the consequence\r\nof long \"stubs\" and torn injured parts. The tree is to be left\r\nshapely, with a uniform distribution of branches, plenty of\r\nfruit-bearing wood, easy to spray and from which to pick the fruit, of\r\nthe form characteristic of the variety.\r\n\r\nIn all the usual customary pruning of the apple-tree, dressing of the\r\nwounds is not necessary. It is much more important to give the added\r\nattention to the proper making of the wounds and the thoughtful choice\r\nof the parts to be removed. Wounds two inches and more in diameter may\r\nbe protected with good paint, so that they will not check and\r\ntherefore not hold water, until the callus covers them. Good judgment\r\nin pruning is more profitable than recipes to repair damage.\r\n\r\nFruit-pruning, or thinning, is the removing of so much fruit, when it\r\nis small, as will allow the remainder to mature to its best and\r\nconstitute a maximum yield; it reduces the quantity of inferior fruit,\r\nlessens the number of culls and the labor at packing time, conserves\r\nthe energy of the tree by preventing the maturity of great numbers of\r\nseeds, diminishes diseases and pests. The overloading of the tree not\r\nonly imposes a heavy tax on its vitality but is likely to break the\r\nlimbs and to work much physical damage.\r\n\r\nThinning may consist in removing part of the fruit in the cluster (in\r\nthe case of varieties that tend to mature more than one fruit from\r\neach flower-cluster), in picking all the fruits from certain clusters\r\nor pairs of clusters, or in cutting away some of the fruit-spurs\r\nbefore blossoming time.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the fruit itself is usually performed after the\r\n\"June-drop,\" when the extent of the crop is evident. The fruits are\r\npulled off by hand or cut with thinning-shears, the latter practice\r\nbeing the better since it is not so likely to break the fruit-spurs.\r\nThe least promising fruits are taken away and the remaining apples are\r\nleft at least five or six inches apart in most varieties. The extent\r\nof thinning must be governed by the variety, thrift of the tree,\r\nresult desired, and other conditions. To secure the best results, the\r\napples should be thinned when still small.\r\n\r\nThinning by early-spring removal of fruit-spurs is a very special\r\npractice. It is employed on dwarf trees and on those specially\r\ntrained. It should be undertaken only by a careful and experienced\r\nman. It is not to be inferred that the fruit of the apple is all borne\r\non spurs, for some of it may be derived from terminal buds on the new\r\naxial growths or even from lateral buds; but the spurs are conspicuous\r\nand readily recognized. Of course the ordinary pruning of the tree\r\nremoves fruit-bearing wood and is therefore a thinning process.\r\n\r\nWithin sensible limits, therefore, pruning is an invigorating process\r\nin the sense that it deflects the energy to remaining parts of the\r\ntree. What is called too heavy pruning, whereby the tree throws out\r\nabundance of water-sprouts, is illustration of this fact: the tree is\r\nthrown into heavy growth of adventitious shoots. The tree may not\r\nproduce more pounds of substance, or even more total feet in length,\r\nbut new energy is developed in certain parts.\r\n\r\nIn the restoration, or so-called renovation, of old neglected trees,\r\nthe two primary considerations are to prune vigorously and to till and\r\nfertilize the land. Sometimes old trees must be mended as explained in\r\nChapter XIII. Of course they must be sprayed for what ails them. If\r\nthe variety is poor, the tree may be top-grafted (Chapter XII). In\r\nsome cases, it is hardly possible to make neglected trees bear\r\nsatisfactorily, for they were never of value: there is nothing to\r\nrestore. It may be a question of soil and location, of lack of\r\npollination, of trees so weak or so misshapen that effort on them is\r\nwasted. But tillage, pruning, spraying, should produce worth-while\r\nresults in most cases.\r\n\r\nIn the care of the fruit-tree there is no practice which brings the\r\ngrower into such intimate knowledge of the plant as that of pruning\r\nand thinning. The operator sees the tree as a whole, taking it all in;\r\nthen he sees it in small detail in all its parts, even to the spurs\r\nand buds. With simple good tools, sharp and keen, and with a practiced\r\neye, he applies a deft and swift handicraft, cutting true, making a\r\nfair clean wound, leaving the tree comely and ready for its highest\r\neffort. The pride of good workmanship may find expression. The\r\noperator feels also the sense of mastery that is in him, whereby he\r\ncorrects the tree, removes the wayward parts, keeps and encourages all\r\nthat is best. To engage in this kind of education requires that one\r\napproaches the work with due preparation of mind and I think also with\r\nconsecration of heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nMAINTAINING THE HEALTH AND ENERGY OF THE APPLE-TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apple-tree starts life fresh and vigorous. It grows rapidly. The\r\nshoots are long and straight. The wood is smooth and fair and supple.\r\nThe leaves are usually large. It is good to see the young trees\r\nacquire size and take shape.\r\n\r\nRoom in the ground and in the air is ample with the young apple-tree.\r\nIt is free to grow. Probably the ground was newly prepared and tilled\r\nwhen the tree was planted; at least, a hole was dug and fine good\r\nearth was placed about the roots. Probably insects had not found\r\npermanent encampment on the tree. It had been well pruned, so that it\r\ncarried the minimum of superfluous and competing parts.\r\n\r\nBut in time the difficulties come. The tree probably slows down. It\r\nbecomes too thick of branches. The land is not tilled. It is not\r\nmanured. Insects and fungi make headway. The tree overbears. As the\r\nyears go on, the tree is thrown into alternate bearing, one year a\r\ncrop too heavy, one year a crop too light. The tree becomes broken,\r\ndiseased, gnarly, unshapely.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the fruit-spur in bearing is likely to make a\r\nleaf-bud for the next year's activities rather than a flower-bud. It\r\nis assumed that the making of a flower-bud requires more energy than\r\nthe making of a plain leaf-bud; if this is true, there may not be\r\nenergy enough to carry a flower-cluster and to make a new flower-bud\r\nat the same time. But if the tree is in proper vigor, is well fed,\r\nprotected from noxious organisms, not allowed to overbear, it should\r\nhave sufficient energy to make a crop every year, frosts and accidents\r\nexcepted. It is assumed, of course, that self-sterile varieties have\r\ngood pollinizing varieties near them; it is always well to plant two\r\nor more kinds near together. Whether the continuity of bearing is\r\nexhibited on the same fruit-spurs or whether there may be an\r\nalternation in the spurs on the same tree, is of no moment in this\r\ndiscussion. It is enough to say that there is no reason in the nature\r\nof the case why an apple-tree should bear only every other year; it is\r\nprobably a question of nutrition.\r\n\r\nThe first essential to continued health and vigor is to start with a\r\nstrong unblemished tree. It is to be planted before its vitality is\r\nlessened by exposure and hard usage. The more direct the transfer from\r\nnursery to orchard, the better. It is to be placed in good ground,\r\nwell drained and deeply spaded or plowed. The apple-tree thrives on\r\nmany kinds of land, but light sand, hard clay, and muck are equally to\r\nbe avoided. \"Good corn land\" is commonly considered to be good apple\r\nland. Certain soils and regions are particularly adaptable to\r\ncommercial apple-growing, but the amateur may plant quite\r\nindependently of this fact. The observant man notes the many\r\nconditions under which the apple-tree may be grown with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIf the land is not uniformly prepared, then the hole dug for the tree\r\nshould be larger than demanded by spread of roots, and the earth\r\nfined in the bottom of it. Trees should be planted when perfectly\r\ndormant, preferably in spring, at least in the northern parts.\r\n\r\nThe roots should be cut back to sound unsplintered wood, and very long\r\nroots may well be shortened. The reader is aware that roots have no\r\nregular order or arrangement as do the buds from which branches arise.\r\nIt is not necessary to try to shape the root-system to any formal\r\nregularity.\r\n\r\nAs a good part of the root-system is destroyed when the tree is dug,\r\nso is the top reduced to insure something like a balance. Half or more\r\nof the top, on a three-year-old tree, is cut away, the long growths\r\nbeing shortened to perhaps three or four good buds. If limbs are left\r\nto form the framework of the future top, they should be alternate with\r\neach other at some distance apart so that weak crotches do not form.\r\n\r\nThe tree is planted snugly, the earth being filled among the roots so\r\nthat no air-holes remain. The tree is shaken up and down to settle the\r\nearth densely. Once or twice in filling, the earth is packed with the\r\nfeet. The purpose is to keep the tree firm and stiff against winds,\r\nand to give all its roots close contact with the earth. Properly\r\nplanted, so that it will not whip or dry out, the tree gets a hold\r\nquickly and begins to grow strongly. The first start-off of the tree\r\nis important.\r\n\r\nApple-trees are held in vigor by plenty of room. For the standard\r\nvarieties in regular orchards, the recommended distance either way is\r\n40 feet, or 35 x 40 feet. Some varieties may go as close as 30 feet;\r\nand in regions (as parts of central and western North America) in\r\nwhich the trees are not expected to attain such great size as in the\r\neastern country, the planting may be even less than this of the\r\nupright-growing kinds. The spaces between the trees may be utilized\r\nfor a few years with other crops, even with other fruits, as peaches\r\nor berries. Orchardists sometimes plant smaller-growing and\r\nearly-bearing varieties of apples between the regular trees as\r\n\"fillers,\" taking them out as the room is needed. Of course all kinds\r\nof double cropping require that extra attention be given to the\r\ntilling and fertilizing of the plantation.\r\n\r\nThe general advice for the growing of strong apple-trees is to give\r\nthe land good tillage from the first and to withhold other cropping\r\nafter the trees come into profitable bearing. Clean tillage for the\r\nfirst part of the season and the raising of a cover-crop in the latter\r\npart, to be plowed under, is a standard and dependable procedure.\r\nTrees live long in continuous sod and they may thrive, but they may be\r\nexpected to show gains under tillage. Vast areas of apple plantings\r\nare in sod, but this of itself does not demonstrate the desirability\r\nof the sod practice. Allowing trees to remain in sod usually leads to\r\nneglect.\r\n\r\nThere is a modification of sod-practice in some parts of the country\r\nthat gives excellent results, under certain conditions. The grass is\r\ncut and allowed to lie, not being removed for hay. Manure and\r\nfertilizer are added as top-dressing, as needed. This method is known\r\nas the \"sod mulch system.\" It is not a practice of partial neglect,\r\nlike the prevailing sod orchards, but a regular designed method of\r\nproducing results. Its application can hardly be as widespread as\r\nclean tillage, on level lands.\r\n\r\nIt is a common opinion that hillsides and more or less inaccessible\r\nslopes should be planted to apples. This may be true in the sense\r\nthat apples will grow on such areas and that such plantations are\r\nbetter than fallow land. In fact, many such lands are profitable in\r\norchards. When they do not allow of tillage, easy spraying, and\r\neconomy in harvesting, however, they cannot compete with level\r\norchards.\r\n\r\nTo maintain the health and energy of the apple-tree, the land should\r\nbe enriched. This may be accomplished by the application of animal\r\nmanures, chemical fertilizers, or cover-crops, or preferably by a\r\ncombination of these means. Not many persons possess sufficient farm\r\nmanures to supply the general crops and the apple-orchard; but every\r\napplication the orchard receives is all to the good. Five to ten tons\r\nof good stable manure to the acre annually is a good addition for an\r\norchard in bearing. This may be supplemented by cover-crops and bag\r\nfertilizers in years in which the manure is not available. Experiments\r\nare yet inconclusive on the fertilizing of apple-trees, but it is fair\r\nto assume that on most lands, particularly on old lands, the addition\r\nof chemical fertilizer is advantageous. A bearing apple-tree may\r\nreceive two to eight pounds of nitrate of soda (depending on its size\r\nand on soil) applied to the full feeding area of the roots, five to\r\nnine pounds of acid phosphate, two or three pounds of muriate of\r\npotash; always ask advice.\r\n\r\nThe pasturing of orchards is often defensible and sometimes even\r\ndesirable. If the trees are growing too rapidly, they may be \"slowed\r\ndown\" by seeding to grass for a time; and pasturing with hogs, and\r\npossibly with sheep, may afford a way of keeping the area in condition\r\nand of adding fertilizer. Sheep that do not have access to\r\ndrinking-water and salt gnaw the trees. Hogs root up the ground and\r\nthereby provide a rude kind of tillage. If animals are fed other food\r\nin the orchard, the fertilizer increment will be considerable.\r\n\r\nIn house-lot conditions, the apple-tree usually receives sufficient\r\nfood if the land is well enriched for garden purposes; but trees in\r\nsod should have liberal top-dressings of fertilizer every year and of\r\nstable manure every other year.\r\n\r\nThe apple-tree should have a good supply of moisture. Planted on banks\r\nand in hard places about buildings, it may suffer in this respect. The\r\nland should be so graded that the rainfall will not run off. In\r\norchard conditions, the moisture is conserved by the addition of humus\r\nto the land, and by thorough judicious tillage; and in dry regions it\r\nis supplied by irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe energy of the apple-tree, and its ability to produce, is conserved\r\nby holding all diseases and noxious insects in check. The means at the\r\ncommand of the apple-grower are now many. No longer is the man\r\nhelpless, nor does he need to appeal to the moon or to \"atmospheric\r\ninfluences\" for reasons. The natural histories of fungi and insects,\r\nthat do so much damage, are now a part of common understandable\r\nknowledge. To acquire at least a working understanding of the\r\ncommonest of these subjects is in itself a great satisfaction and\r\ngives one a sense of dominion. The good books and bulletins are\r\nsufficient to keep one well informed. All these organisms are tenants\r\nof the apple-tree, and from the naturist's point of view alone they\r\nare not to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be inferred that all apple-trees will yield equally well\r\nwith equally good treatment. There is difference in trees as there is\r\nin cows. We may not know why. But even so, it is our part to do the\r\nbest we can: this is our privilege.\r\n\r\nThe tillage and care of plants lessen the struggle for existence. So\r\nis the apple-tree protected from the crowds, from contest for moisture\r\nand food, from insects, and from the competition within itself.\r\nThereby is it able to express all its possibilities. Even the dormant\r\npotentialities may be wakened, and the plant makes a wide departure\r\nfrom its native state. This is not an original state of sin, but a\r\nstate of repression in which it is held in a world that is full of so\r\nmany things beside apple-trees. I may till my orchard ever so well,\r\nmanipulate the trees ever so promptly, yet if the plantation then is\r\nallowed to run to neglect the processes of depreciation gain the\r\nmastery; the struggle for existence is restored.\r\n\r\nTo keep one's apple-tree in the pink of perfection is as joyful an\r\nenterprise as to do anything else well. It is only the well-conditioned\r\ntree that yields its glorious harvest year by year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nHOW AN APPLE-TREE IS MADE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the seeds of a Baldwin or Winesap apple are planted, we do not\r\nexpect to get a Baldwin or Winesap; we shall probably raise a very\r\ninferior fruit. The apple has not been bred \"true to seed\" as has the\r\ncabbage and sweet pea. To get the tree \"true to name,\" of the desired\r\nvariety and with no chance of failure (barring accident), is one of\r\nthe niceties of horticulture. This is accomplished with great\r\nprecision and despatch.\r\n\r\nThe apple-tree is started from the seed. It cannot be grown freely by\r\nmeans of cuttings, as can the grape and currant. In commercial\r\npractice the seeds are collected mostly from cider mills or from\r\npomace. The seeds may be washed from the pomace, allowed to dry, and\r\nthen mixed in sand, charcoal, sawdust or other material to prevent\r\ndessication and kept until spring, when they are sown. Or, if the land\r\nis not so wet in winter that the seed will drown or be washed out, the\r\nseed in the pomace (not separated) may be sown in autumn. The seeds\r\nare sown in drills, after the manner of onions or turnips, one to two\r\nor even three inches deep. They germinate readily in the cool of\r\nspring, and the plants should reach a height of twelve inches and more\r\nthe first year.\r\n\r\nIf these plants were grown directly into bearing trees, it is\r\nprobable that no two trees would produce the same kind of fruit. Some\r\nof the fruit might be summer apples, some of it winter apples, some\r\nred, yellow or striped, some of it flat, oblong or spherical, most of\r\nit sour but perhaps some of it sweet. Probably every kind would be\r\ninferior to the parent stock or to standard varieties, although there\r\nis a fair chance that a superior kind might originate from a field of\r\nsuch plants.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is not the variety (that is, the top) that is wanted in\r\nthe raising of these numerous plants, but merely the roots, on which\r\ndesired varieties may be grown by the clever art of graftage. Yet not\r\neven all the roots may be wanted, for the growing plants may differ or\r\nvary in their stature and vigor as well as in their fruit. The\r\ndiscriminating grower, therefore, discards the weak and puny treelings\r\nat the digging time; or if the weak plants seem still to have promise,\r\nthey may be allowed to grow another year before they are dug for the\r\ngrafting.\r\n\r\nThis digging time is the autumn of the first year, when the plants\r\nhave grown one season. They are then to be used as \"stocks\" on which\r\nto graft Baldwin, Winesap or other varieties. The growing of these\r\napple stocks is a business by itself. Formerly, most of the stocks\r\nused in North America were imported from France, where special skill\r\nhas been developed in the growing of them and where the requisite\r\nlabor is available. But now the stocks are grown also in deep rich\r\nbottom lands of the Middle West, as in Kansas, where, in the long\r\nseasons, a large growth may be attained.\r\n\r\nThe methods of graftage of the commercial apple-tree are two--by\r\ncion-grafting whereby a bit of wood with two or three buds is inserted\r\non the stock, by bud-grafting (budding) whereby a single bud with a\r\nbit of bark attached is inserted under the bark of the stock.\r\n\r\nCion-grafting is practiced in winter under cover. The stock is cut off\r\nat the crown and the cion spliced on it, or the root may be cut in two\r\nor more pieces and each piece receive a cion. The union is made by the\r\nwhip-graft method (Fig. 16). The cion is tied securely, to keep it in\r\nplace. The piece-root method is allowable only when the root is long\r\nand strong, so that a well-rooted plant results the first year. The\r\ncion is a cutting of the last year's growth (as of No. 1, in Fig. 14).\r\nHowever accomplished, the process is to supply the cion with roots; it\r\nis planted in another plant instead of in the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 16. The whip-graft before tying.]\r\n\r\nThe cion-grafts are now planted in the nursery row in spring. The cion\r\nstarts growth rapidly, only one shoot being allowed to remain; this\r\nshoot forms the trunk or bole of the future tree. At the end of the\r\nfirst season, the little tree is said to be one year old, although the\r\nroot is at least two years old; at the end of the second year it is\r\ntwo years old; the tree is sometimes sold as a two-year-old, but\r\nusually a year later as a three-year-old having a four-year-old root.\r\nIn fact, however, the root and top may be considered, in a way, to be\r\nof the same age, particularly if only a piece of the root is employed,\r\nfor the cion grew on its parent tree the same year the root was\r\ngrowing in the nursery.\r\n\r\nThe tree grew from the seed but it is no longer a \"seedling\" or a\r\n\"natural;\" it is now a grafted tree, destined to produce a named\r\nrecognized variety of apple, maybe York Imperial, maybe Jonathan. We\r\nfind seedling trees in old fields, in fence-rows, and in woods. These\r\nhave grown from scattered seeds and have come to fruit without the\r\narts of the propagator. They bear their own tops or heads, rather than\r\nthe heads that a thrifty horticulturist would have put on them. Now\r\nand then such a tree produces superior fruit; then a discriminating\r\npomologist discovers it, names it a new variety, and propagates it as\r\nother varieties are propagated. Thus have most of the prized varieties\r\noriginated, without knowledge on the part of man of the ultimate\r\nprocesses. But now with the accumulating knowledge of the\r\nplant-breeder we hope to be able to foresee and probably to produce\r\nvarieties of given qualities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 17. A \"bud\" before tying.]\r\n\r\nBud-grafting is practiced in summer. The young trees, obtained from\r\nthe grower of apple stocks, are planted regularly in nursery rows in\r\nspring, the top having been cut back to the crown so that a strong\r\nvigorous shoot will arise. In July and August or September, when this\r\nshoot is the size of a lead pencil and larger and the bark will peel\r\n(or separate from the wood), a single bud is inserted near the ground\r\n(Fig. 17). This bud is deftly cut from the current year's growth of\r\nthe desired variety; it grows in the axil of a leaf (Fig. 15). The\r\nleaf is removed but a small part of the stalk or petiole is retained\r\nwith the bud to serve as a handle. A boat-shaped or shield-shaped\r\npiece of bark is removed with the bud. This piece, known technically\r\nas a \"bud,\" is inserted in an incision on the stock, so that it slips\r\nunderneath the bark and next the wood, with only the bud itself\r\nshowing in the slit; it is then tied in place.\r\n\r\nThe stock on which the bud is inserted has a two-year root, and the\r\nroot is entire. For this reason, budded trees are usually very large\r\nand strong for their age when compared with piece-root trees grown\r\nunder similar conditions of climate, tillage and soil.\r\n\r\nThe bud does not grow the year it is inserted in the stock; it is\r\ndormant until the following spring, as it would have been had it\r\nremained on its parent branch; but soon after it is inserted it\r\nattaches itself fast to the stock: it is a bud implanted from one twig\r\nto another. The following spring, if the operation is successful, the\r\nbud \"grows,\" sending up a strong shoot that makes the trunk of the\r\nfuture tree. The top of the stock is cut away; in the merchantable\r\ntree, the bend or place may be seen where the stock and cion meet.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of cion-grafting, we now have a top of a known variety\r\ngrowing on the root of an unknown kind. The tree is sold at two or\r\nthree years, counting the age of the top; and of course the tree is no\r\nlonger called a seedling, and it produces its implanted variety as\r\naccurately as does the cion-grafted tree. Equally good trees are\r\nproduced by both cion-grafting and bud-grafting.\r\n\r\nThe apple-tree is now \"propagated,\" and is ready for the planting.\r\nGreat hopes will be built on it, and the tree will probably do its\r\npart to justify them. Nobody knows how a bud from a Baldwin tree holds\r\nthe memory of a Baldwin or from a Winesap tree the memory of a\r\nWinesap. Neither does anyone know why of two seeds that look alike one\r\nwill unerringly produce a cabbage and the other a cauliflower. So\r\naccustomed are we to these results that we never challenge a twig of\r\napple or a seed of cabbage: we assume that the twig or the seed\r\n\"knows.\" Nor have we yet approached this question in our elaborate\r\nstudies of plant-breeding. Here is one of the mysteries that baffles\r\nthe skill of the physiologist and chemist, yet it is a mystery so very\r\ncommon that we know it not, albeit the life on the planet would\r\notherwise be utter confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE DWARF APPLE-TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have learned that many kinds of apples and apple-trees may come\r\nfrom a batch of seeds. Differences are expressed in the tree as well\r\nas in the fruit. In fact, stature is usually one of the\r\ncharacteristics of the variety. Here I open Downing's great book, \"The\r\nFruits and Fruit-Trees of America,\" and find the description of a\r\ncertain variety beginning: \"Tree while young very slow in its growth,\r\nbut makes a compact well-formed head in the orchard,\" and another:\r\n\"Tree vigorous, upright spreading, and productive.\" We know the small\r\nstature and early bearing of the Wagener (wherefore it is often\r\nplanted in the orchard as a filler), and the great wide-spreading head\r\nof the Tompkins King with the apples scattered through the tree.\r\n\r\nNow it so happens that in the course of time certain great races of\r\nthe apple-tree have arisen, we do not know just why or how. There is\r\nthe race or family of the russets and of the Fameuse. So are there\r\nseveral races very small in stature, remaining perhaps no larger than\r\nbushes. If we were to propagate any of the ordinary apples on such\r\ndiminutive stocks, we should have a \"dwarf apple-tree.\"\r\n\r\nThe dwarf apple, then, is not a question of variety but of stock. Any\r\nvariety may be grown as a dwarf by grafting it on a plant that\r\nnaturally remains small, although some varieties are more adaptable\r\nthan others to the purpose.\r\n\r\nIf seeds of the natural diminutive apple-tree are sown, a variety of\r\ntrees and apples may be expected. The fruits would probably be\r\ninferior. Probably the stature would vary between different seedlings.\r\nIf we are to get the effect of dwarfness, we must be sure that the\r\nstock is itself really dwarf. Therefore, to eliminate variation and\r\nalso because seeds of natural dwarf apples may not be had in\r\nsufficient quantity, the stocks are propagated by layers rather than\r\nby seeds.\r\n\r\nThe diminutive tree, when well established, is cut off near the\r\nground. Sprouts arise. Some kinds sucker very freely. If earth is\r\nmounded up around the sprouts, roots form on them and the sprouts may\r\nbe removed and treated as if they were seedling stocks. Usually the\r\nmounding is not performed until the shoots have made one season's\r\ngrowth. Gooseberries and some other plants are often propagated by\r\nmound-layers. In the case of the gooseberry, however, it is desired\r\nthat the layer reproduce the parent--it may be Downing or\r\nWhitesmith--and therefore it is planted without further manipulation.\r\nBut in the case of the apple, we do not want the layer to reproduce\r\nthe parent, for the parent would probably bear an inferior fruit since\r\nit does not represent an \"improved\" or recognized variety; therefore\r\nthe layer is grafted or budded with the particular variety we desire\r\nto grow as a dwarf tree.\r\n\r\nDwarf trees are grown in America, if at all, only in gardens, where\r\nextra attention may be given them. Only high-class kinds should be\r\nattempted on dwarfs, for the quantity-production of commercial apples\r\nmust be obtained by less intensive methods on cheaper lands.\r\n\r\nBetter fruits often are grown on dwarf than on standards, for two\r\nreasons: It is usual to propagate only the best varieties on dwarf\r\nstock; the little tree must receive extra care in pruning and in every\r\nother way. Its bushel of apples must be choice, every one, to make the\r\neffort of growing the tree worth the while. Under European conditions\r\nwhere land is high-priced and labor has been relatively cheap, it is\r\npossible (and common) to raise apples on dwarfs for market, as it is\r\nprofitable to terrace the hillsides with human labor; but in North\r\nAmerica the conditions are practically the reverse and the dwarf tree\r\ncannot compete with the standard orchard tree.\r\n\r\nThe growing of a dwarf tree is essentially a gardening practice. It\r\nrequires great skill. The spurs are produced and protected to a\r\nnicety. Every fruit may be the separate product of handwork. The\r\nfertilizing, mulching, watering, are carefully regulated for every\r\ntree. Often the trees are trained on cordons, espaliers, trellises or\r\nwalls. The individual fruits may be tied up or bagged. All this is\r\nvery different from the raising of apples by means of tractors and\r\nother machinery, gangs of pruners and pickers, broadside extensive\r\nmethods, with highly organized systems of handling and marketing, in\r\nall of which the money-measure is the chief consideration. It is for\r\nall these reasons that the growing of a few dwarf apple-trees may\r\nafford such intimate satisfaction to a careful man who prizes the\r\nresult of his skill.\r\n\r\nThe dwarfs are grown as little trees branching near the ground, headed\r\nin at top and side and kept within shape and bounds. If they are of\r\nthe dwarfest dwarfs and not trained on trellis or wall (as they\r\nusually are not in America), the fruit may be gathered by a man\r\nstanding on the ground, even from old trees. The dwarfs are planted\r\neight to ten feet apart when grown in regular plantation.\r\n\r\nBe it said that certain kinds of stocks produce trees only semi-dwarf;\r\nand in all cases if the tree is planted so deep that roots strike from\r\nthe cion, the top will probably outgrow the stock, being supplied in\r\npart or even entirely by its own roots.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a consideration of some of the kinds of dwarf\r\nstocks, or dwarf races of the apple-tree. Be it said, in understanding\r\nof the subject, that there are naturally dwarf forms of many plants,\r\nand probably all ordinary plants are capable of producing them. Thus\r\nthere are very compact condensed forms of arbor-vitae, Norway spruce,\r\npeach-tree. These have originated as seed sports and are multiplied by\r\ncuttings. So are there dwarf tomatoes, dwarf China asters, dwarf sweet\r\npeas, all coming more or less true from seeds, for these species (of\r\nshort generations) have been bred to reproduce their variations. The\r\ninquirer must not suppose, therefore, that the races of dwarf\r\napple-trees are an anomally in the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to speak of two classes or races of dwarf apple-trees,\r\nthe Paradise and the Doucin. The former kinds are the smaller, the\r\ntrees on their own roots sometimes reaching not more than four feet in\r\nheight at full bearing maturity. On the Paradise stocks, the grafted\r\napple-tree is very small; it is a true dwarf. The Doucin trees are by\r\nnature larger, and apples grafted on them make semi-dwarf trees,\r\nmidway in stature between the real dwarfs and the common standard or\r\n\"free\" apple-trees.\r\n\r\nThe case is not so simple, however, as this brief statement would make\r\nit appear. There are many kinds of Paradise stock, as also of Doucin.\r\nIf one were to bring together living plants of all the kinds of\r\nnatural dwarfs and semi-dwarfs that could be found in nurseries and\r\ngrowing collections, one would undoubtedly find a nearly complete\r\nseries, so far as stature of tree is concerned, from the very dwarf to\r\nthe full-sized standard tree. To say that a person is growing grafted\r\ndwarf apple-trees does not signify how large the trees may be expected\r\nto grow, for one may not know the particular kind of stocks on which\r\nthe variety is grafted. In fact, it is considered even in Europe,\r\nwhere dwarf apples are chiefly grown, that the proper identification\r\nof dwarf stocks is still a subject for careful investigation.\r\n\r\nWhen the Paradise dwarfs first came into existence is undetermined.\r\nThey appear to have been known in the Middle Ages. The many races, as\r\nthe Dutch, French, Metz, Nonsuch, Broad-leaved, indicate an ancient\r\norigin. We cannot be too certain what apple-trees were meant in the\r\nearly references to the Paradise apple. The fruits of the present\r\nnatural Paradise apple-trees are not sufficiently attractive to\r\njustify us in considering them the \"Tree of Paradise\" or apple of the\r\nGarden of Eden, which circumstance is supposed by some to account for\r\nthe name. \"Paradise\" was originally a park or pleasure ground, applied\r\nalso to the Garden of Eden, and later to horticultural gardens. John\r\nParkinson wrote his great treatise on horticulture, 1629, under the\r\ntitle, \"Paradisi in Sole Paradisus terrestris; or, a Choice Garden of\r\nall Sorts of Rarest Flowers, etc.\" Now we use the word for gardens of\r\nbliss.\r\n\r\nThe word Doucin, from the Italian, is supposed originally to have\r\ndesignated apples of sweet flavor, but it now applies technically to a\r\nclass or race of semi-dwarf apple-trees.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this little book, however, the interest in the\r\ndwarf apple centers not so much in the origin of the stock as in the\r\nnatural-history of the tree itself and the good skill of hand and\r\nheart that one may expend in the growing of it. If one would come\r\nclose to a plant, knowing it intimately in every season, causing it to\r\nrespond to sympathetic treatment through a series of years, then a\r\ngarden collection of dwarf apples may satisfy the desire. It is too\r\nbad that we do not have time to cultivate the dwarfs often in the\r\nyards and gardens of North America. We are more familiar with the\r\nraising of dwarf pears (which are grafted on quince stocks since there\r\nis no similar race of natural dwarf pear-tree), but we do not give\r\nthem the thumb-and-finger care that is demanded for the choicest\r\nresults. The abundance of apples in the market should only stimulate\r\nthe desire of the connoisseur to have trees and fruits that are wholly\r\npersonal. The market produce can never gratify the affections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nWHENCE COMES THE APPLE-TREE?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the dwarf apple-tree goes back to the Middle Ages and perhaps\r\nfarther, then whence comes the apple originally? No one can surely\r\nanswer. Carbonized apples are found in the remains of the prehistoric\r\nlake dwellings of Switzerland. When recorded history begins, apples\r\nwere well known and widely distributed. The apple-tree is wild in many\r\nparts of Europe, but it is difficult to determine whether, in a given\r\nregion, it is indigenous or has run wild from cultivation. Wild\r\napple-trees are common in North America, but no one supposes that the\r\norchard apple is native here.\r\n\r\nExpert opinion generally considers that the apple is native in the\r\nregion of the Caspian Sea and probably in southeastern Europe. Perhaps\r\nit had spread westward before the Aryan migrations. It had also\r\nprobably spread eastward, but it is not a cultivated fruit in China\r\nand Japan except apparently as introduced in recent time. The apple is\r\nessentially a fruit of central and northern Europe, and of European\r\nmigration and settlement.\r\n\r\nIt is a fertile retrospect to conceive of the apple as an attendant of\r\nthe course of Western civilization. Without voice and leaving no\r\nrecord, it has nevertheless followed man in his wanderings, encouraged\r\nhis attainment of permanent habitations, succored him in his\r\nemergencies. What the apple has contributed to sustenance can never be\r\nknown, but we are aware that it yields its fruit abundantly, that it\r\nthrives in widely unlike regions and conditions, that the tree has the\r\nruggedness to endure severe climates and to provide food that can be\r\nstored and transported. In the ages it must have stood guard at many a\r\nrude camp and fireside. It would be fascinating to know what the\r\napple-tree has witnessed.\r\n\r\nThese early apples must have been very crude fruits measured by the\r\nproduce of the present day. But other food was crude and man was\r\ncrude. The North American Indians found the apple to be worth their\r\neffort; remains of some of the so-called Indian orchards of the Five\r\nNations in New York persisted until the present generation. These were\r\nseedling apple-trees, grown from the stocks introduced by the white\r\nman. The French missionaries are said to have carried the apple far\r\ninto the interior, and early settlers took seeds with them. The\r\nlegends and records of Johnny Appleseed, sowing the seeds as he went,\r\nare still familiar. My father, like other pioneers, took seeds from\r\nthe old New England trees into the wilderness of the West; the\r\nresulting trees were top-grafted, some of them as late as my time; I\r\ncan remember the apples some of these seedling trees bore, the like of\r\nwhich I have never seen again, probably poor apples if we had them in\r\nthis day but to a boy at the edge of the forest the very essence of\r\ngoodness. As early as 1639, apples had been picked from trees planted\r\non Governor's Island in Boston harbor. Governor John Endicott of\r\nMassachusetts Colony had an apple-tree nursery in the early day; in\r\n1644 he says that five hundred of his trees were destroyed by fire.\r\nSo the apple came early to be a standby on the new continent.\r\n\r\nThe apples of the colonists were not all for eating, but for drinking.\r\nThe butts and barrels of cider put in cellars in the early times seem\r\nto us most surprising. Herein are suggestions of old social customs\r\nthat might lead us into interesting historical excursions. The oldest\r\nbook I possess on the apple is \"Vinetum Britannicum: or, a Treatise of\r\nCider,\" published in London in 1676; it treats also of other beverages\r\nmade from fruits and of \"the newly-invented ingenio or mill, for the\r\nmore expeditious and better making of cider.\" The gradual change in\r\ncustoms, whereby the eating of the apple (rather than the drinking of\r\nit) has come to be paramount, is a significant development; the use of\r\napple-juice may now proceed on another basis, on the principle of\r\npreservation and pasteurization rather than of fermentation.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom to call the apple _Pyrus Malus_. This is the name\r\ngiven by the great Linnaeus, with whom the modern accurate naming of\r\nplants and animals begins. The nomenclature of plants starts with his\r\n\"Species Plantarum,\" 1753. Pyrus is the genus or group comprising the\r\npears and apples, and Linnaeus included the quince; Malus is Latin for\r\nthe apple-tree. Together the names represent genus and species,--the\r\nmalus Pyrus.\r\n\r\nThese statements are easy enough to make, but it is impossible to\r\ndemonstrate whether the common pomological apples are derived from one\r\noriginal species or from two or more. Many technical botanical names\r\nhave been given in the group, but we need not pause with them here. It\r\nis enough for our purpose to know that the natural-history of the\r\napple, as of anything else that runs to time immemorial, passes at\r\nthe end into obscurity. We seem never to reach the ultimate origins or\r\nto find an end to our quests.\r\n\r\nThere are other apples than the common pomological orchard types.\r\nThere are the crabs. In general usage, the word \"crab\" designates an\r\napple that is small, sour and crabbed. Such apples are wildings or\r\nseedlings. They are merely depreciated forms of _Pyrus Malus_, and\r\nprobably much like the first apples known to man. What are known to\r\nhorticulturists as crab-apples, however, are other species of Pyrus,\r\nof different character and origin. We need not pause with the\r\ndiscussion of them, except to say that the commonest kinds are the\r\nlittle long-stemmed fruits of _Pyrus baccata_ (berry Pyrus), native in\r\neastern Europe and Siberia. These are the \"Siberian crabs.\" The leaves\r\nand twigs are smooth, and the calyx falls away from the fruit, leaving\r\na bare blossom end. These little hard handsome fruits are used in the\r\nmaking of conserves. Certain larger crab-apples, in which the blossom\r\nend is not clean or bare, as the Transcendent and Hyslop, are probably\r\nhybrids between the true crabs and the common apple; this class\r\nprovides the main crab-apples of the markets.\r\n\r\nWhen the settlers came to the country west and south of New England,\r\nthey found another kind of crab-apples in the woods, truly native. The\r\nfruits were hard and sour, but they could be buried to ripen. The\r\ntrees are much like a thorn-apple,--low, spreading, twiggy, thorny;\r\nbut the pink-white large fragrant flowers are very different. The wild\r\ncrab-apple was called _Pyrus coronaria_ by Linnaeus, the \"garland\r\nPyrus.\" On the prairies is another species, _Pyrus ioensis_; it yields\r\na charming double-flowered form, \"Bechtel's crab.\" In the South are\r\nother species. In fact, _P. coronaria_ itself may not be a single\r\nspecies. These wild crabs run into many forms. In the northern\r\nMississippi and prairie country are native apples good enough to be\r\nintroduced into cultivation under varietal names. These are _Pyrus\r\nSoulardii_, a species bearing the name of J. G. Soulard, Illinois\r\nhorticulturist. These crab-apples are probably natural hybrids between\r\n_Pyrus Malus_ and the prairie crab, _P. ioensis_. Had there been no\r\nEuropean apple to be introduced by colonists, it is probable that\r\nimproved forms would have been evolved from the native species. In\r\nthat event, North American pomology would have had a very different\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThere remains a very different class of apple-trees, grown only for\r\nornament and usually known as \"flowering apples.\" They are mostly\r\nnative in China and Japan. They are small trees, or even almost\r\nbushes, with profuse handsome flowers and some of them with very\r\nornamental little fruits. They have come to this country largely from\r\nJapan where they are grown for decoration, as the cherries of Japan\r\nare grown not for fruit but for their flowers, being of very different\r\nspecies from the cherries of Europe and America. The common apple\r\nitself yields varieties grown only for ornament, as one with\r\nvariegated leaves, one with double flowers, and one with drooping\r\nbranches. These are known mostly in Europe; but these forms do not\r\ncompare in interest with the handsome species of the Far East.\r\n\r\nAll these differing species of the apple-tree multiply the interest\r\nand hold the attention in many countries. They make the apple-tree\r\ngroup one of the most widespread and adaptable of temperate-region\r\ntrees. It will be seen that there are three families of them,--the\r\nEurasian family, from which come the pomological apples; the North\r\nAmerican family, which has yielded little cultivated material; the\r\nEast-Asian family, abundant in highly ornamental kinds. There are no\r\napple-trees native in the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe apple-tree, taken in its general sense, has a broad meaning. What\r\nmay be accomplished by breeding and hybridizing is beyond\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE VARIETIES OF APPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery seedling of the pomological apples is a new variety. Some of\r\nthese seedlings are so good that they are named and introduced into\r\ncultivation. They are grafted on other stocks, and become part of the\r\ngreat inheritance of desirable apples.\r\n\r\nIt is to be expected that in the long processes of time in many\r\ncountries the number of varieties will accumulate to high numbers. No\r\none knows all the kinds that have been named and propagated, but they\r\nrun into many thousands. No one book contains them all, although some\r\nof the manuals are voluminous. Varieties drop out of existence, being\r\nno longer propagated; new varieties come in.\r\n\r\nSo the lists of varieties gradually change. A list of one hundred\r\nyears ago would contain many names strange to us. Thus, of the sixty\r\napples in \"A Select List of Fruit-Trees\" by Bernard M'Mahon, published\r\nin \"The American Gardener's Calendar,\" in 1806, not more than six or\r\neight would be understandable to a planter of the present day.\r\n\r\nWith the standardizing of practices in the commercial growing of\r\nfruits, the tendency is to reduce the number of varieties to small\r\nproportions; it is these varieties that the nurserymen propagate.\r\nHere and there over the country are still trees of the extra-quality\r\nbut uncommercial varieties known to a former generation. If the\r\namateur now wants to grow these varieties, he must find cions as best\r\nhe can by patient correspondence, and graft them on his own trees.\r\nWhen I planted an orchard twenty-five years ago, I found cions of\r\nJefferis here, of Dyer there, of Mother, Swaar and Chenango in other\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nIn the enlarged edition of Downing's \"Fruits and Fruit-Trees of\r\nAmerica,\" 1872, are descriptions of 1856 varieties, of which 1099 are\r\nAmerican in origin, 585 foreign, 172 of origin unknown. The lists are\r\nnot only much smaller in these days, but the foreign element tends to\r\npass out. With the introduction of the Russian apples for the cold\r\nNorth in the latter part of the past century, the importation of\r\nforeign varieties practically ceased, as it ceased also for the pears\r\nat an earlier date with the introductions of Manning, Wilder and\r\nothers. The epoch of the \"testing\" of varieties passed away, and with\r\nit has gone an appreciative attitude toward fruits and even toward\r\nlife that constitutes a sad lack in our day.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years ago (1892) I compiled an inventory of all the\r\nvarieties of apple-trees sold in North America, as listed in the\r\nninety-five nurserymen's catalogues that came to my hand. The inventory\r\ncontains 878 varieties. In the present year, however, perhaps not more\r\nthan 100 varieties are handled by nurserymen in Eastern United States.\r\nProbably the dealer and grower would consider even this small number\r\nmuch too great. The highly developed standardized business of the\r\npresent day, aiming at quantity-production, naturally reduces the\r\nvariety of products, whether in manufacturing or horticulture, and\r\naims at uniformity. Under the influence of this leadership, we are\r\nlosing many of the old products, varieties of apples among the rest.\r\n\r\nWhy do we need so many kinds of apples? Because there are so many\r\nfolks. A person has a right to gratify his legitimate tastes. If he\r\nwants twenty or forty kinds of apples for his personal use, running\r\nfrom Early Harvest to Roxbury Russet, he should be accorded the\r\nprivilege. Some place should be provided where he may obtain trees or\r\ncions. There is merit in variety itself. It provides more points of\r\ncontact with life, and leads away from uniformity and monotony.\r\n\r\nThe leading varieties of apples, that have become dominant over wide\r\nregions, have been great benefactors to man. The original tree should\r\nbe carefully preserved till the last, by historical or other\r\nsocieties; and then a monument should be placed at the spot. Monuments\r\nhave been erected to the Baldwin, Northern Spy, McIntosh and other\r\napples. We should never lose our touch with the origins of men,\r\nevents, notable achievements, outstanding products of nature.\r\n\r\nI fear it is now a habit with many fruit-growers to minimize the\r\ninterest in varieties, placing the emphasis on tillage, spraying and\r\nmanagement of plantations. Yet, the only reason why we expend all the\r\nlabor is that we may grow a given kind of apple; the variety is the\r\nfinal purpose.\r\n\r\nIn this little book we cannot discuss varieties at length. There are\r\nspecial books on this fascinating subject. But we may have before us a\r\ncompiled list by way of interesting suggestion. The list is sorted\r\nfrom the Catalogue of Fruits of the American Pomological Society,\r\n1901, the last year in which the catalogue was published with quality\r\nrated on a scale of 10. On such a scale, Ben Davis ranks 4-5; Baldwin,\r\n5-6; Wealthy and York Imperial, 6-7; Rhode Island Greening, 7-8;\r\nNorthern Spy, 8-9; Yellow Newtown (Albermarle Pippin) 9-10. There is\r\nno apple in the entire catalogue of 324 kinds (not including\r\ncrab-apples) rated wholly lower than 4 in quality except one alone and\r\nthis is grown for cider only, although several varieties of minor\r\nimportance bear the marks 3-4. Only two varieties are rated\r\nexclusively 10, the Garden Royal, a Massachusetts summer-fall apple,\r\nlittle known to planters, and the familiar Esopus Spitzenberg. Of\r\ncourse judgments differ widely in these matters, as there are no\r\ninflexible criteria for the scoring of quality; yet this extensive\r\nlist is probably our soundest approach to the subject.\r\n\r\nThe varieties in the catalogue of the American Pomological Society are\r\nstarred if \"known to succeed in a given district\" and double-starred\r\n\"if highly successful.\" North America is thrown into nineteen\r\ndistricts for the purposes of this catalogue (which comprises other\r\nfruits besides apples). For our purposes we may combine them into six\r\nmore or less indefinite great regions: n. e., the northeastern part of\r\nthe country, Delaware and Pennsylvania to eastern Canada; s. e., the\r\nparts south of this area and mostly east of the Mississippi; n. c.,\r\nnorth central, from Kansas and Missouri north; s. w., Texas to\r\nArizona; mt., the mountain states of the Rockies west to the Sierras,\r\nincluding of course much high plains country; pac., the Pacific slope,\r\nWashington to southern California.\r\n\r\nOf the varieties starred and double-starred in these various\r\ngeographical regions there are 107; these are listed herewith. Of\r\ncourse the intervening twenty years might change the rating of some of\r\nthese apples, other varieties have come to the front, and certain ones\r\nof these older worthies are receding still further into the\r\nbackground; but the exhibit is suggestive none the less.\r\n\r\nArkansas--n.e., s.e., n.c., s.w., mt.\r\nBailey (Sweet)--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nBaker--n.e.\r\nBaldwin--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt., s.w., pac.\r\nBeach--s.e.\r\nBelle Bonne--n.e.\r\nBen Davis--n.e., s.e., n.c., s.w., mt., pac.\r\nBietigheimer--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nBledsoe--s.e.\r\nBlenheim--n.e., n.c.\r\nBlue Pearmain--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nBough, Sweet--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nBryan--s.e., mt.\r\nBuckingham--n.e., s.e., n.c.\r\nCanada Reinette--n.e., n.c., mt.\r\nClayton--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nClyde--n.e., n.c.\r\nCogswell--n.e.\r\nCooper--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nCracking--s.e., n.c.\r\nDoyle--s.e.\r\nEarly Pennock--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nEsopus (Spitzenburg)--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt., pac.\r\nEwalt--n.e., s.e., mt.\r\nFallawater--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nFall Harvey--n.e., mt.\r\nFall Jenneting--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nFall Orange--n.e., s.e., n.c.\r\nFall Pippin--n.e., s.e., n.c., s.w., mt.\r\nFanny--n.e., s.e., n.c., s.w.\r\nFarrar--s.e.\r\nFoundling--n.e.\r\nGano--n.e., s.e., n.c., s.w., mt.\r\nGilbert--s.e.\r\nGolding--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nGravenstein--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt., s.w., pac.\r\nHagloe--n.e., s.e.\r\nHoover--s.e., n.c., mt., pac.\r\nHopewell--n.c.\r\nHorse--n.e., s.e., n.c.\r\nHubbardston--n.e., s.e., n.c., s.w.\r\nHunge--s.e.\r\nHuntsman--s.e., n.c., s.w., mt.\r\nIsham (Sweet)--n.c.\r\nJacobs Sweet--n.e.\r\nKent--n.e., s.e., n.c.\r\nKernodle--s.e.\r\nLady Sweet--n.e., mt.\r\nLankford--n.e., s.e.\r\nLawver--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nLilly (of Kent)--n.e.\r\nLowe--s.e.\r\nLowell--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nMcAfee--n.e., s.e, mt.\r\nMcCuller--s.e.\r\nMcMahon--n.e., n.c., mt.\r\nMagog--n.e.\r\nMaverack--s.e.\r\nMilwaukee--n.c.\r\nMinister--n.e., s.e., n.c.\r\nMonmouth--s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nNewell--n.c.\r\nNickajack--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nNorthern Spy--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt., pac.\r\nNorthwestern (Greening)--n.e., n.c., mt.\r\nOconee--n.e., s.e.\r\nOhio Nonpareil--n.e., s.e.\r\nOhio Pippin--n.e., s.e., n.c.\r\nOrtley--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nParagon--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nPatten (Greening)--n.c.\r\nPease--n.e.\r\nPeck (Pleasant)--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nPeter--n.c.\r\nPewaukee--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nPorter--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nPumpkin Sweet--n.e., s.e., n.c.\r\nQuince--n.e., n.c.\r\nRamsdell (Sweet)--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nRed Astrachan--n.e., s.e., n.c., s.w., mt., pac.\r\nRhode Island (Greening)--n.e., s.e., n.c., s.w., mt., pac.\r\nRidge (Pippin)--n.e.\r\nRolfe--n.e.\r\nRome--n.e., s.e., n.c., s.w., mt.\r\nStark--n.e., s.e., n.c., s.w., mt.\r\nStarkey--n.e., s.e.\r\nStayman Winesap--n.e., s.e., n.c.\r\nSterling--n.e., n.c.\r\nSummer King--n.e., s.e.\r\nSwaar--n.e., n.c., mt., pac.\r\nTaunton--s.e.\r\nTitovka--n.e., mt.\r\nTompkins King--n.e., s.e., mt., pac.\r\nTwenty Ounce--n.e., s.e., s.w., mt.\r\nUtter--n.c.\r\nVanhoy--n.e., s.e.\r\nVirginia Greening--s.e., mt.\r\nWashington (Strawberry)--n.e., s.e., mt.\r\nWatson--s.e.\r\nWhite Pippin--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt., pac.\r\nWine--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nWistal--s.e., s.w.\r\nWolf River--n.e., s.e., n.c., mt.\r\nYellow Bellflower--n.e., s.e., s.w., mt., pac.\r\nYellow Newtown--n.e., s.e., n.c., s.w., mt., pac.\r\nYopp--s.e.\r\nYork Imperial--n.e., s.e., n.c., s.w., mt.\r\n\r\nThere are many odd varieties of apple not found in any list but about\r\nwhich questions are likely to arise. One of these is the\r\nSweet-and-Sour. There is an old ribbed variety of this name, the ribs\r\nhaving an acid flesh and the furrows sweetish; it is little known and\r\nof no special value. Apples are sometimes found that are sweetish on\r\none side and sourish on the other. The reasons for this kind of\r\nvariation are no more understood than are those responsible for\r\nvariance in color or shape or durability. One yet sometimes hears the\r\npleasant fable that sweet-and-sour apples are produced by splitting\r\nthe bud when the tree was propagated.\r\n\r\nThe Surprise is a small whitish apple with light red flesh. It is\r\nindeed a surprise to bite into such an apple, but it has little merit.\r\nIt is an early winter variety.\r\n\r\nOne is frequently asked about the Sheepnose apple, particularly by\r\nolder people who remember it from early days and who deplore its\r\ninfrequency in these latter times. The sheepnose shape--long-conical--is\r\nan infrequent variation, as apples go, and apparently none of these\r\nforms chances to have sufficient merit to keep it in the lists. The\r\nname is often applied to the Black Gilliflower, an old apple more than\r\nthree inches long, dark red, of light weight perhaps because of the\r\nlarge core, ripening late in autumn to midwinter. It seems to be\r\nspecially prized by children, perhaps in part because of its unusual\r\nshape and in part by its aromatic fragrance; but it is not a high-class\r\napple, and is now little seen. With the Rambo, Vandevere, some of the\r\nrussets, Early Harvest, Jersey Sweet and other old worthies, it\r\nprobably will pass away unless rescued here and there by the amateur.\r\nTo the lover of choice fruit nothing is old; every succeeding crop is\r\nas choice and new as is the new year itself, and one waits for it\r\nagain and again.\r\n\r\nOne hears of seedless and no-core apples, as also of pears. The core\r\nis present but greatly reduced in size, and the seeds may be few and\r\nsmall. I have also raised practically seedless tomatoes. All these are\r\ninfrequent variations that may be propagated by asexual parts\r\n(cuttings, cions), but as yet none of them has any outstanding value.\r\n\r\nThe reader will now ask me about the water-core apples, so much sought\r\nand prized by youngsters. The water-core is not characteristic of a\r\nvariety, although occurring in some varieties more frequently than in\r\nothers. It is a physiological condition, supposed to be associated\r\nwith a relatively low transpiration (evaporation) so that excess water\r\nis held in the fruit. In certain seasons this condition is marked, and\r\nalso in cloudy regions and often on young trees that have an\r\nover-supply of moisture. Yet such cores occur in old trees and\r\nsometimes with more or less regularity. What the physiological\r\ninability may be in such cases to dispose of excess moisture appears\r\nto be undetermined.\r\n\r\nNow and then one finds a double apple, with two fruits grown solidly\r\ntogether, two blossom ends and a single stem. A seedling tree I knew\r\nas a boy bore such apples frequently, sometimes a score of them among\r\nthe crop of the year. This, of course, is a malformation or\r\nteratological state. Apparently two flowers coalesce to form these\r\nfruits. On the tree of which I speak, the two fruits were about equal\r\nin size, making a large, widened, edible apple, but I have known of\r\nother cases in which a diminutive undeveloped fruit is attached to the\r\nside of a normal one.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the oddest of them all is the \"Bloomless apple.\" It is said to\r\nhave no flowers. In fact, however, the flowers are present but they\r\nlack showy petals and are therefore not conspicuous. The bloomless\r\napple is a monstrous state, the cause of which is unknown. Now and\r\nthen a tree is reported. It was described at least as long ago as\r\n1768, and in 1770 Muenchhausen called it _Pyrus apetala_ (the\r\npetalless pyrus). The flowers have no stamens, and apparently they are\r\npollinated from any other apples in the vicinity. In 1785, Moench\r\ndescribed it as _Pyrus dioica_ (the dioecious pyrus, sexes separated\r\non different plants). The ovary is also malformed, having six or seven\r\nand sometimes probably more cells, and bearing ten to fifteen styles.\r\nThe resulting fruit has a core character unknown in other apples but\r\napproached in certain apple-like fruits, as the medlar. The fruit has\r\na hole or opening from the calyx (which is open) into the core; and\r\nthe core is roughly double, one series above the other. The fruit, in\r\nsuch specimens as I have seen or read about, has no horticultural\r\nmerit; but it is a curiosity of great botanical interest. It appears\r\nnow and then in widely separated places, the trees probably having\r\noriginated as chance seedlings. The fruits from the different\r\noriginations are not always the same in size and form, but the flowers\r\napparently all have the same malformed character.\r\n\r\nThe apple is preeminently the home fruit. It is not transitory. It\r\nspans every season. In an indifferent cellar I keep apples till apples\r\ncome again. The apple stands up, keeps well on the table. Children may\r\nhandle it. In color and form it satisfies any taste. Its rondure is\r\nperfect. The cavity is deep, graceful and well moulded, holding the\r\ngood stem securely. The basin is a natural summit and termination of\r\nthe curvatures, bringing all the lines together, finishing them in\r\nthe ornaments of the remaining calyx. The fruit adapts itself to the\r\nhand. The fingers close pleasantly over it, fitting its figure. It has\r\na solid feel. The flesh of a good apple is crisp, breaking, melting,\r\ncoolly acid or mildly sweet. It has a fracture, as one bites it,\r\npossessed by no other fruit. One likes to feel the snap and break of\r\nit. There is a stability about it that satisfies; it holds its shape\r\ntill the last bite. One likes to linger on an apple, to sit by a\r\nfireside to eat it, to munch it waiting on a log when there is no\r\nhurry, to have another apple with which to invite a friend.\r\n\r\nNow I am not thinking of the Ben Davis apple or any of its kind. I do\r\nnot want to be doomed to one variety of apple, or even to half a dozen\r\nkinds, and particularly I do not want a poor one. There are enough\r\ngood apples, if we can get them. The days of the amateur fruit-growers\r\nseem to be passing. At least we do not hear much of them in society or\r\nin many of the meetings of horticulturists. There may be many reasons,\r\nbut two are evident: we give the public indifferent fruits, and\r\nthereby neither educate the taste or stimulate the desire for more; we\r\ndo not provide them places from which they can get plants of many of\r\nthe choicest things. Yet on a good amateur interest in fruits depends,\r\nin the end, the real success of commercial fruit-growing. Just now we\r\nare trying to increase the consumption of apples, to lead the people\r\nto eat an apple a day: it cannot be accomplished by customary\r\ncommercial methods. To eat an apple a day is a question of affections\r\nand emotions.\r\n\r\nWe have had great riches in our varieties of apples. It has been a\r\nvast resource to have a small home plantation of many good varieties,\r\neach perfect in its season. The great commercial apple-growing has\r\nbeen carried to high perfection of organization and care. More perfect\r\napples are put on the market, in proportion to numbers, than ever\r\nbefore,--carefully grown and graded and handled. I have watched this\r\nAmerican development with growing pride. The quantity-production makes\r\nfor greater perfection of product, but it does not make for variety\r\nand human interest, nor for high-quality varieties. We shall still\r\nimprove it. Masterful men will perfect organizations. The high\r\ncharacter and attainment of the commanding fruit-growers, nurserymen\r\nand dealers are good augury for the future. But all this is not\r\nsufficient. Quantity-production will be an increasing source of\r\nwealth, but it cannot satisfy the soul.\r\n\r\nThe objects and productions of high intrinsic merit are preserved by\r\nthe amateur. It is so in art and letters. It is necessarily so. A body\r\nof amateurs is an essential background to the development of science.\r\nThe late Professor Pickering, renowned astronomer, encouraged the\r\namateur societies of star-observers, and others. The amateurs in the\r\nbackground, disinterested and unselfish, support appropriations by\r\nlegislatures for even abstruse public work. The amateur is the\r\nembodiment of the best in the common life, the conservator of\r\naspirations, the fulfillment of democratic freedom. I hope pomology\r\nwill not lag in this respect. In all lines I hope that professionalism\r\nwill not subjugate the man who follows a subject for the love of it\r\nrather than for the gain of it or for the pride of it. In\r\nhorticulture, when we lose the amateur, who, as the word means, is the\r\nlover, we lose the ideals.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the nurseryman cannot grow trees of all the good apples\r\nthat may be wanted. The experiment stations cannot maintain living\r\nmuseums of them, for their function is to investigate rather than to\r\npreserve. Arboretums are concerned with other activities. Is there not\r\nsome person of means, desiring to do good to his successors, ready now\r\nto establish a fructicetum _in perpetuum_ for the purpose of\r\npreserving a single tree of at least one hundred of the choicest\r\napples, to the end that a record may be kept and that amateurs may be\r\nsupplied with cions thereof?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE PLEASANT ART OF GRAFTING\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I procure cuttings of a good apple, what shall I do with them that\r\nthey may give me of their fruitage?\r\n\r\nThe cuttings will probably be dormant twigs of the last season's\r\ngrowth. They may not be expected to grow when placed in the ground.\r\nThey are therefore planted in another tree, becoming cions. The case\r\nis in no way different in principle from the propagating of the young\r\ntree in the nursery, of which we already have learned. The nurseryman\r\nworks with a small stock, a mere slip of a seedling one or two years\r\nold. The grower would better not attempt the making of nursery trees.\r\nIt is better for him to purchase regular nursery trees and to graft\r\nthe cions on them; or he may put the cions in any older tree that is\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of my own collecting of certain dessert apples. I\r\n\"worked\" them on young Northern Spy trees, purchased when two or three\r\nyears old; they were grafted after they had stood a year in the\r\norchard. These Northern Spy trees, used in this case as stocks, were\r\nregularly grown by nurserymen. The Northern Spy was chosen because of\r\nits hardiness and straight, clean, erect growth, making it a vigorous\r\nand comely stock. Weak-growing varieties are usually rejected for this\r\npurpose. Some growers use Oldenburg as stock, and there are other\r\ngood kinds.\r\n\r\nFrom the young stock, the old head is to be removed and a new head\r\n(the new variety) grown in its stead. The tree, therefore, will be\r\ncombined of three kinds of apple,--the root of unknown quality; the\r\ntrunk or body under a varietal name; the top, of the variety desired.\r\nAny number of different kinds of apple wood may be worked into the\r\ntree if the tree is large enough. If the operations are well performed\r\nso that there are no imperfect unions, and if the pruning is\r\njudicious, the tree may be grafted many times, in whole or in part.\r\n\r\nI have said that my father brought apple seeds from New England and\r\nthat the resulting seedlings were top-grafted. One of these trees was\r\nearly top-worked to \"Holland Pippin,\" which seldom bore. It stood in\r\nthe yard near the smoke-house, where it found abundant nourishment. It\r\ngrew to great size. In time I became a grafter of trees for the\r\nneighborhood, and often as I returned at night would have cions of\r\ndifferent kinds in my pockets. It became a pastime to graft these\r\ncions in the old tree. More than thirty varieties were placed there.\r\nIt was with keen anticipation, as the years came, that I looked for\r\nthe annual crop, to see what strange inhabitants would appear in the\r\ngreat tree-top. I do not remember how many of these varieties came\r\ninto bearing before the tree was finally gathered to the wood-box, but\r\nthey were a goodly number, probably more than a score. I used often to\r\nwonder how it was that the nutrients taken in by the roots of the\r\nVermont seedling and transported in the tissues of the Holland Pippin,\r\ncombined with the same air, could produce so many diverse apples and\r\neven pears (for I had pears in that tree) each with the marks and\r\nflavor proper to its kind. The little cions I grafted into the tree\r\nwere soon lost in the overgrowth, and yet all the branches that came\r\nfrom them carried the genius of one single variety and of none other.\r\nAnd I often speculated whether there were any reflex action of these\r\nmany varieties on the root, demanding a certain kind of service from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe cions (sometimes still called \"grafts\") are cut in winter or early\r\nspring, when well matured and perfectly dormant. Placed in sand in a\r\ncool cellar so they will not shrivel, they are kept until grafting\r\ntime, which is early spring, usually before the leaves start on the\r\nstock. The cions may be placed on the tree by several methods, but\r\nonly two are commonly employed,--the whip-graft and the cleft-graft.\r\nThe former is adapted to small stocks, the size of one's finger or\r\nsmaller; it is the method employed in root-grafting in the nursery,\r\nand Fig. 16 explains it.\r\n\r\nThe requirement is to cause the cion and stock to grow together\r\nsolidly, making one piece of wood. The growing plastic region is\r\nassociated with the cambium tissues underneath the bark. It is\r\nnecessary, therefore, to bring the \"line betwixt the wood and the\r\nbark\" together in the two parts, and to hold the junction firm and\r\nalso well protected from evaporation until union takes place. The\r\nmethod of putting the parts together, the form of whittling, is a\r\nmatter of convenience and practice.\r\n\r\nThe case was put in this way by old Robert Sharrock, \"Fellow of\r\nNew-College,\" in his \"History of the Propagation and Improvement of\r\nVegetables by the concurrence of Art and Nature\" (I quote from the\r\nsecond edition, Oxford, 1672): \"Grafting is an Art of so placing the\r\nCyon upon a stock, that the Sap may pass from the stock to the Cyon\r\nwithout Impediment.\" Batty Langley, in 1729, gave this direction in\r\nthe \"Pomona\": \"The Stocks being cleft, you must therefore cut the Cion\r\nin the Form of a Wedge, which must always be cut from a Bud, for the\r\nReasons aforesaid; and then with a Grafting-Chizel open the Slit, and\r\nplace the Cion therein, so that their Barks may be exactly even and\r\nsmooth.\"\r\n\r\nStill earlier (1626) did William Lawson, in \"A New Orchard and\r\nGarden,\" set forth the rationale of the practice in his Chapter X, \"On\r\nGrafting,\" in this wise: \"Now are we come to the most curious point of\r\nour faculty: curious in conceit, but indeed as plaine and easie as the\r\nrest, when it is plainly shewne, which we commonly call Graffing, or\r\n(after some) Grafting. I cannot Etymoligize, nor shew the original of\r\nthe word, except it come of graving and carving. But the thing or\r\nmatter is: The reforming of the Fruit of one Tree with the fruit of\r\nanother, by an artificial transplacing or transposing of a twig, bud\r\nor leafe, (commonly called a Graft) taken from one tree of the same,\r\nor some other kind, and placed or put to, or into another tree in due\r\ntime and manner.\"\r\n\r\nIf the whip-graft is to be below the ground, it is sufficient to tie\r\nthe parts tightly with string and cover with earth; if above ground,\r\nwax is applied over the string to prevent drying out. On the small\r\nshoots of young trees, the whip-graft is often employed, but it is not\r\nused in large trees.\r\n\r\nThe cleft-graft is shown in Fig. 18. The trunk or branch is cut off;\r\ntwo cions are inserted in a cleft made with a knife. The \"stub\" is\r\ncovered with grafting-wax (Fig. 19). Cleft-grafting is the usual\r\nmethod for the orchardist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 18. The cleft-graft.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 19. The cleft-graft after waxing.]\r\n\r\nIn either kind of grafting, the cion carries about three leaf-buds. If\r\n\"wood\" (cion-shoots) is scarce, only one bud may be taken, but this\r\nreduces the chances of success. One bud may not grow, or the young\r\nshoot may be injured. The lowest bud is usually most likely to grow;\r\nit pushes through the wax.\r\n\r\nIn young trees set for the purpose of top-working, the trunk may be\r\ncut off at the desired height and two cions inserted. The entire top\r\nis then removed at once; this is allowable only on young trees.\r\nProbably the better practice is to graft the main small side limbs and\r\nthe main trunk or leader higher up. Usually it is better to leave some\r\nof the branches on the tree, not removing them all till the second or\r\nthird year.\r\n\r\nIn old apple-trees, the main branches are grafted, where they are an\r\ninch or two in diameter. Care is taken so to choose the branches that\r\na well-shaped free-headed tree will result. Only a small part of the\r\ntop is removed the first year, and three or four years may be required\r\nto change the top all over, the old branches being removed as the new\r\nones grow. In about three years, or four, the grafts should begin to\r\nbear,--about as soon as strong three-year-old trees planted in the\r\norchard.\r\n\r\nAny variety of the pomological apples will grow on any other variety,\r\nbut apples do not take well on other species, as does the pear. The\r\npear may be made to grow on the apple, but the graft is short-lived\r\nand the practice is not recommended. Boys may graft indiscriminately\r\nfor practice, but grown-ups, having arrived at the unfortunate age of\r\ndiscretion, must operate only on those kinds known to succeed when\r\njoined. I have never known a boy who did not want to graft anything,\r\nas soon as his attention was called to the operation. The boy does not\r\ntake it for granted: he wants to try.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE MENDING OF THE APPLE-TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nMany accidents overtake the apple-tree. The hired man skins the tree\r\nwith the harrow; fire runs through the dry grass; hard winters shatter\r\nthe vitality, and parts of the tree die; borers enter; rabbits and\r\nmice gnaw the bark in winter; loads of fruit and burdens of ice crush\r\nthe tree; wind storms play mischief; bad pruning leaves long stubs,\r\nand rot develops; cankers produce dead ragged wounds; fire-blight\r\ndestroys the tissue; a poorly formed tree with bad crotches splits\r\neasily; grafts fail to take, and long dead ends are left; the tree is\r\ninjured by pickers; vandals wreak their havoc. All these accidents\r\nmust be met and the damages repaired. The surgeon must be summoned.\r\n\r\nWe must first understand how a wound heals on a tree. Note any\r\nwound,--knot-hole on the trunk, place where wood has been removed. The\r\nexposed wound itself does not heal; it is covered and inclosed by\r\ntissue built out from the edges or periphery of the wound. This tissue\r\nis like a roll. It is the callus. Eventually the tissue meets in the\r\ncenter, and the lid is thereby put on the place, and it is sealed. The\r\nexposed wood has died, if it is the cross-section of a branch or a\r\ndeep wound, and it remains under the callus a dead body. If the wood\r\nhas not started to decay in the meantime, the place is safe, but too\r\noften invasion has begun before the process is complete, the rot\r\ndisease finally extends to the heart of the tree, causing it to become\r\nhollow. If the center of the wound falls in, the callus cannot cover\r\nit, and an open sore remains. In these cavities birds may sometimes\r\nbuild.\r\n\r\nTherefore there are two points for the surgeon to consider in respect\r\nto the wound itself--whether it is so placed on the tree that the\r\ncallus forms readily; whether the wound is kept healthy during\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nAll ragged tissue being removed, deep-wound surfaces should be kept\r\naseptic. For ordinary cases, white-lead paint with plenty of linseed\r\noil is a good protective from the germs of decay. On old wood, no\r\nlonger active, creosote is good, perhaps followed by coal-tar.\r\nUsually, however, paint is quite sufficient. Small exposures usually\r\nreceive no dressing. When the fresh surface wood is exposed by removal\r\nof bark, it is necessary to keep the tissue from drying out, and\r\nantiseptics are usually not applied. Bandaging with cloth is the usual\r\npractice, after the wound is cleaned and trimmed.\r\n\r\nThe repairs fall into two classes,--those that require merely removal\r\nof injured parts and treatment of the wounds, and those that demand\r\nthe ingrafting of new wood.\r\n\r\nWe have learned, in the discussion of pruning, that long projecting\r\nends of severed branches do not heal. The branches to be removed\r\nshould be cut back close to the larger branch or to the juncture with\r\nanother. In repairing injured trees, all projecting parts that do not\r\nhave life in themselves must be removed. All wounds should be left\r\nsmooth, without splinters or hanging bark. Decaying wood is to be\r\nremoved, and the area cleaned out and disinfected.\r\n\r\nThe nature-lover may find much to interest him in the observation of\r\nknot-holes as he comes and goes. Every knot-hole has a history; this\r\nhistory usually can be traced by one whose eye is keen and who becomes\r\npracticed in connecting cause with final result. One prides oneself on\r\nthe ability to work out the obscure cases. An old neglected apple\r\norchard thereby affords much entertainment.\r\n\r\nIf a very large branch breaks off, the remaining part is cut back to\r\nfresh hard wood; antiseptic is applied; the other part of the tree may\r\nbe shortened-in to aid in restoring the proportion or balance.\r\n\r\nDeep cavities caused by rot are cleaned out, disinfected with bordeaux\r\nmixture, gas-tar, or other material, and the place filled completely\r\nwith cement.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, new wood is added in the form of cions of last year's\r\ntwigs. Such cions may be set around the edge of a stub, thrust between\r\nthe bark and the wood, to start new branches where an important one\r\nwas broken off. The cions are cut wedge-shape (much as those in Fig.\r\n18) and a bandage is tied around the stub to hold them in place; the\r\nexposed parts are covered with grafting-wax. The operation is\r\nperformed in spring.\r\n\r\nSometimes cions are used to bridge a girdle. Usually a girdle heals\r\nitself if the injury does not extend into the wood, and if it is bound\r\nup to prevent drying out; but when the injury is deep and the exposed\r\nwood has become dry and hard, the cions may be used. The cions are\r\nsomewhat longer than the width of the girdle. The edges of the girdle\r\nare trimmed to fresh tight bark; cions are cut wedge-shape at either\r\nend; the ends are inserted underneath the bark at bottom and top of\r\nthe wound; edges of the wound are securely bandaged; entire work is\r\ncovered with wax. The cions are many, so close that they nearly touch.\r\nThe buds on the cions are not allowed to produce branches. This\r\nprocess is known as bridge-grafting.\r\n\r\nWith some experience, the cultivator soon learns to make many deft\r\napplications of ingrafting. Sometimes a piece of bark may be used as a\r\npatch. In the bracing of crotches in young trees, the two trunks may\r\nbe joined by uniting a small branch from either one, twisting them\r\ntogether to form a bridge like a bolt; they can be made to grow\r\ntogether, forming a solid union. Bolting the parts with iron rods, or\r\nholding them together by means of chains, is the usual and commonly\r\nthe better method. The iron is not to go around a limb, however, for\r\ngirdling results; the rods or chains should be secured by bolts bored\r\nthrough the wood and pulling against large heads or washers.\r\n\r\nThe usual repairs are easily made. When trees are badly injured, and\r\nparticularly when the tree is low in vitality, it may not be worth\r\nwhile to engage in surgery. It may be better to plant a new tree.\r\nSaving very old trees by the mending processes is not likely to be\r\nsatisfactory. The grower should transfer his affection to a young\r\ntree. If the tree has had good care throughout its life, it probably\r\nwill not need much surgery in old age. The grower will be willing,\r\nwhen the time comes, to take a photograph for memory's sake and to let\r\nthe tree come to a timely and artistic end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nCITIZENS OF THE APPLE-TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nMany years ago, my old friend, the late Dr. J. A. Lintner, State\r\nEntomologist of New York, compiled a list of 356 insects that feed on\r\nthe apple-tree. Later authorities place the number at nearly five\r\nhundred species. It must be a good plant that has such a host of\r\ndenizens. The number of fungi is also large; and the tree often\r\nsupports lichens, algæ, and other forms of life.\r\n\r\nThe apple-tree is not single in its denizens. No plant lives alone. It\r\nhas association with its fellows, perhaps contest for space and\r\nnourishment. It provides habitat for many organisms, many of which\r\nlive on its bounty. I have never seen a bearing apple-tree that was\r\nnot a colonizing place for other living things. We accept these things\r\nas matters of course, as being in place, living their part in nature.\r\nTherefore, one cannot understand the apple-tree unless one knows\r\nsomething of its citizenry.\r\n\r\nProbably the most prominent citizen of the apple-tree is the\r\ncodlin-moth. Its larva is the apple-worm, the one that makes \"wormy\r\napples,\" the burrows going to the core and out again. The insect is\r\nnative in Europe, but has been known in North America nearly two\r\nhundred years, and is widespread in the apple countries of the world.\r\n\r\nIf one has screens in the apple cellar, one is likely to find small\r\nmoths on them in the spring, larger than a clothes moth, about\r\nthree-fourths inch in spread of the soft gray watered-silk wings. This\r\nis the imago or mature form of the insect known as the codlin-moth (it\r\nlives on codlins or apples). The larvæ or \"worms\" were brought into\r\nthe cellar in the apples; some of them crawled out, spun themselves in\r\na cocoon and pupated; in due season the moth emerged, ready to lay the\r\neggs for other larvæ. Ordinarily the fruit-grower does not see the\r\nmoth, for it is a small object amidst the foliage of apple-trees; the\r\nlarva or apple-worm he knows well.\r\n\r\nThere may be two or more broods of apple-worms, depending on the\r\nlength of the season. In the northern apple regions of North America\r\nthere is usually only one brood, with a partial second brood. The\r\nfirst brood is hatched from eggs laid by moths that emerge in spring.\r\nThe moths come from larvæ that have lain in cocoons all winter, hidden\r\nunder bark on the trunks and main branches of the apple-tree, in\r\ncrevices in nearby posts and fences, and sometimes in the ground. The\r\npupæ are the transformed larvæ or worms that left the apple of the\r\nprevious year, usually before it fell, and crawled down the tree to\r\nfind a place to spin the silken brown cocoons in which they wrapped\r\nthemselves to undergo the wonderful transformation.\r\n\r\nSo is the cycle complete: egg laid in early spring, mostly on the\r\nleaves; larva hatched in about one week, crawling to the young apple\r\nto feed, where it lives for perhaps a month; larva departed from the\r\nfruit to form a cocoon and to remain quiescent till it pupates the\r\nfollowing spring (if there is no second brood) when it transforms into\r\na moth; the moth alive for one week or ten days, laying perhaps as\r\nmany as one hundred eggs or even more. If there is a second or third\r\nbrood, the pupa resurrects in ten days or so into the moth; eggs are\r\nlaid; larvæ are hatched; pupæ again are formed; and thus is the\r\nprocess continued. But the winter stage is the larva, although perhaps\r\nin store-houses the moths may emerge earlier and survive till spring.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the first brood are commonly laid on the leaves and fruit.\r\nThe young larva or worm eats very little on the foliage. It usually\r\ncrawls into the blossom end of the apple. The young apple stands\r\nerect, with the calyx open (Fig. 6); later the calyx closes and\r\nprotects the larva that hatched there, forming a good cover for its\r\noperations (Fig. 7). The worm drives for the core, where it eats the\r\nyoung seeds and burrows extensively; then, when nearly grown, it sets\r\nout for the surface, eating a straight burrow; an opening is made\r\nthrough the skin of the apple, but this exit is plugged until the\r\nanimal is ready to leave the place and to crawl down the tree to\r\npupate. The larvæ of later broods may enter at the side of the apple,\r\nwhere a leaf affords protection or where two fruits come together; but\r\nthe life-history is the same, varying in its rapidity.\r\n\r\nThis account discloses the vulnerable point in the life-history, if\r\none is to destroy the insects and to grow fair fruit; if poison is\r\nlodged on the erect open-topped little apple, the young larva will get\r\nit before he injures the fruit. If the application of the poison is\r\ndelayed until the calyx closes (Fig. 7), there will be small chance\r\nof reaching the worm. The best way to reach the second brood is to\r\ndestroy all the first brood. The standard practice, therefore, is to\r\nspray the trees soon after the petals fall, with the idea of\r\ndepositing arsenic in the blossom end.\r\n\r\nBut the season of egg-laying is long, often extending over a period of\r\nthree or four weeks, for the moths do not all emerge from the cocoons\r\nsimultaneously. It is customary, therefore, to spray again about two\r\nweeks after the first application, with the hope of catching the young\r\nworms on their way to the fruit.\r\n\r\nThere is no question about the efficacy of spraying. Its value has\r\nbeen demonstrated time and again. The methods and the materials may be\r\nlearned from the experiment station publications in any State, wherein\r\nthe advice is kept up-to-date.\r\n\r\nIn the days before the perfecting of the spraying processes, the\r\ncodlin-moth was controlled by catching the pupating larvæ. Taking\r\nadvantage of the habit of the worm to find lodgment under the bark on\r\nthe trunk, it was the practice to scrape the loose bark from bole and\r\nlarge branches to destroy the hiding-places and then to tie a band of\r\ncloth around the trunk. Under this band the worms were taken, as they\r\nspun themselves up in the cocoons. This is a lesson taken from the\r\nindustrious woodpeckers, who, in the winter, search the trees for the\r\npupæ and make holes through the flakes of bark to get them. The\r\nscraping of apple-trees is not much recommended now for the reason\r\nthat this special necessity is passed, and because the better tillage\r\nand care together with the soaking of the branches and trunk in the\r\nspraying operation, tend to keep the tree vigorous and the bark\r\nproperly exfoliated.\r\n\r\nSo the worm in the apple has a delicate and interesting history. From\r\negg to imago the transformations proceed with regularity, and they are\r\nmarvelous. Had we not traced the sequence, no man could tell by\r\nappearances that the larva, the pupa and the moth are one and the same\r\nanimal. They seem to have nothing in common. So is the egg stage as\r\ndifferent as the other three, but we are measurably prepared for this\r\nepoch, since we know seeds so well; the egg and the seed are\r\nanalogous. That a moth in the air should come from a crawling worm in\r\nan apple is indeed one of the miracles of nature. The worm leaves the\r\napple ere it falls; how the worm knows the time is again a mystery. By\r\nsome instinct, it is able to cognize a dying apple. The later worms,\r\neither the lastlings from the early brood or the product of subsequent\r\nbroods, may remain in the apple when it is harvested, particularly in\r\nan apple picked before it is quite mature and from which the worm has\r\nnot escaped.\r\n\r\nThe apple-worm ruins the crop by killing many of the fruits and by\r\nblemishing the remainder. Seldom are there two worms in an apple. They\r\nseem to respect each other's hunting-ground. From the worm's point of\r\nview and from man's, one is enough.\r\n\r\nIf man has dominion and if he needs apples, then is he within his\r\nrights if he joins issue with the insects. Yet is the insect as\r\ninteresting for all that. I think we should miss many of the\r\nsatisfactions of life, and certainly some of the disciplines, if there\r\nwere no insects. My apple-tree is a great place for a naturalist. Van\r\nBruyssel wrote a book on \"The Population of an Old Pear-Tree.\" \"When\r\ncertain blue spirits begin to flit about me,\" he writes, \"I depart\r\nfrom my study to go and read, in what I am allowed, even by my\r\nclerical uncle, to call my book of devotions. The devotions I mean are\r\nnot in my book-case. No publisher, if he ever thought of such a thing,\r\ncould bring them out. They are a page of the book of Nature, opened in\r\nthe country, under blue sky, displayed at all season.\" What a\r\nmarvelous company Van Bruyssel found on his old pear tree; and what\r\ninexhaustible worlds did Fabre discover in the lives of the spider,\r\nthe fly, the caterpillar, the wasps, the mason-bees and others!\r\n\r\nTherefore we need not pause with the other four hundred and more\r\ninsect citizens of the apple-tree. Some of them, as the San José\r\nscale, are not peculiarly apple-tree insects. My tree has another crew\r\nof inhabitants, and to this company we may now have introduction.\r\n\r\nThe spots on the leaves and fruits are not deposits of dirt nor are\r\nthey caused by mysterious conditions in the atmosphere, as once\r\nsupposed, nor is it in the nature of leaves to be spotted and of\r\nfruits to be scabby; nor are the one-sided dwarfed fruits merely\r\naccidents. The organism responsible for these blemishes is less\r\nevident than the codlin-moth; yet what fruit-grower knows the eggs of\r\nthe codlin-moth? But the organisms are as definite as are the insects;\r\nno longer are the fungi things without form and without positive\r\ncycles.\r\n\r\nOn the ground are apple leaves, shed in the autumn. On the leaves are\r\nspots or lesions,--injured or \"diseased\"--infected with the apple-scab\r\nfungus. Under a good microscope the investigator finds immature\r\nfruiting bodies in these areas. In the early days of Spring, these\r\nbodies or winter-spores mature. A rain discharges them in astonishing\r\nnumbers. Rising in the air (for they are incredibly light), these\r\nspores lodge on the unfolding leaves and flowers of the apple, and\r\nthere begin to germinate, invading the tissue. The tissue is\r\npenetrated and killed so rapidly that the practiced eye soon discovers\r\na \"spot.\" The leaf, if badly infected, may not reach full size; it may\r\ncurl; it may die and fall; the tree thereby is injured.\r\n\r\nFrom the fungus in the active diseased areas, another kind of spore\r\ndevelops rapidly. It is the summer-spore, which may be produced in\r\nprodigious numbers, and being discharged carries the disease\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nAll summer the process of spore-formation and distribution keeps up.\r\nIf conditions are favorable, the tree is invaded in foliage and fruit.\r\nThe flower-stems in the unfolding buds are attacked by the\r\nwinter-spores and the flower falls. The apples become spotted from the\r\ninvasion of the summer-spores, perhaps misshapen. Late infections may\r\nnot show at picking time, but develop on the fruit in storage. The\r\naffected leaves are cast in the autumn, the winter-spores begin to\r\nform, the snows come and hide the processes, in spring the spores\r\nmature; and so does the round of life go on and on.\r\n\r\nThere are beautiful forms in these fragile fungus threads that eat\r\ntheir way into the tissues of the host. There are fascinating\r\nphenomena in the growth and reproduction. Even so and for all that,\r\nman protects his tree by spraying it with poison, and thereby again\r\ndoes he have dominion.\r\n\r\nThe spraying for apple-scab is with lime-sulfur to which may be added\r\narsenate of lead. This treatment, properly timed, may suffice also\r\nfor the codlin-moth. As the fungus may attack the flower-stems and\r\nkill them, so is the first application made when the flower-buds open\r\nand the stems begin to separate, but before the flowers expand; the\r\noperator has a period of one to three days in which to spray. A second\r\nspraying is given just after the blossoms fall, as for codlin-moth; if\r\nthe season is wet, a third application may be made ten to fourteen\r\ndays later; if the fungus seems to spread, a fourth spraying may be\r\napplied in midsummer. These sprayings, variously modified, control not\r\nonly the codlin-moth and the scab fungus but also scale, blister-mite,\r\nplant-lice, leaf-roller, case-bearer, bud-moth, red-bug and others.\r\n\r\nIn the tropics one sees trees bearing great burdens of orchids and\r\nbromeliads and ferns and mosses, and one wonders at the strange and\r\nexuberant population. Yet here is my apple-tree supporting epiphytes\r\nand parasites and insects, protector and nurse of a goodly company;\r\nand birds nest on the branches thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE APPLE-TREE REGIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe northern hemisphere is the home of the apple, particularly Central\r\nEurope, Canada, the United States. In certain regions in the southern\r\nhemisphere the temperature and humidity are right for the good growing\r\nof apples, mostly in elevated areas. In New Zealand and parts of\r\nAustralia, apple-growing is assuming large proportions. Their export\r\ntrade to Europe and parts of South America has come to be important\r\nand undoubtedly is destined greatly to increase.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, where land is often limited and high in price, apple-trees\r\nmay be planted closer than in America, even in field conditions, and\r\nmore attention is given to pruning, heading-in, and the development of\r\nfruit-spurs in the interior of the tree-top. I noticed this practice\r\nin New Zealand, also. In these directions, the Europeans have much to\r\nteach us in the careful growing of good apples. In Europe, the\r\ndefinite training of the apple-tree begins in the nursery;\r\nquantity-production, with standardization, is not there the aim.\r\n\r\nIn North America the general practice is to let the tree take its\r\ncourse, reaching its full natural stature. The pruning is mostly\r\ncorrective, to keep the tree in shape and to prevent the top from\r\nbecoming too thick, rather than in the development of fruiting wood.\r\nThe consequence is that our trees become very large, specially in New\r\nYork and New England where they are long-lived. In the western\r\ncountry, as we have learned, the apple-tree tends to be shorter-lived\r\nand does not usually attain such great size. In the New York apple\r\ncountry, orchards may be in good bearing at forty to sixty years from\r\nplanting, and individual trees may be productive much longer than\r\nthis. The trees come into good bearing in ten to fifteen years. In the\r\nirrigated regions of the West, the trees may be expected to bear a\r\ngood crop two to five years earlier; to what age they may attain, in\r\nlarge plantations, it is yet too early to state.\r\n\r\nThe commercial apple regions of North America are in Canada and the\r\nnorthern United States, comprising about two or three tiers of States,\r\nwith important extensions southward into the mountains and in special\r\nparts. The Southern States are not known as apple-growing country,\r\nexcept in special restricted elevated areas, although there are\r\nconsiderable plantations near the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe geography of apple-growing on the North American continent cannot\r\nbe better displayed than by copying the table of contents of the\r\nlarger part of Chapters III and II in Folger and Thomson's excellent\r\nrecent book, \"The Commercial Apple Industry of North America:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Commercial Apple Production in Canada_\r\n\r\n    Nova Scotia\r\n    Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick\r\n    Quebec\r\n    Ontario\r\n    British Columbia.\r\n\r\n_Leading Apple Regions of the United States_\r\n\r\n    Western New York\r\n    Hudson Valley\r\n    New England Baldwin belt\r\n    The Champlain district\r\n    New Jersey\r\n    Delaware\r\n    Shenandoah-Cumberland district\r\n    Piedmont district of Virginia\r\n    Minor regions in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Virginia\r\n    Mountain region of North Carolina\r\n    Mountain region of Georgia\r\n    Ohio\r\n      Southern Ohio, Rome Beauty district\r\n      Minor regions in Ohio\r\n    Kentucky\r\n    Michigan\r\n    Illinois\r\n      Southern Illinois early apple region\r\n      Mississippi Valley region of Illinois\r\n    Ozark region\r\n    Missouri River region\r\n    Arkansas Valley of Kansas\r\n      Southeastern Illinois\r\n    Colorado\r\n    New Mexico\r\n    Utah\r\n    Montana\r\n    Washington\r\n      Yakima Valley\r\n      Wenatchee North Central Washington district\r\n      Spokane district\r\n      Walla Walla district\r\n    Oregon\r\n      Hood River Valley\r\n      Rogue River Valley\r\n      Other apple districts in Oregon\r\n    Idaho\r\n      Payette district\r\n      Boise Valley\r\n      Twin Falls\r\n      Lewiston section\r\n    California\r\n      Watsonville district\r\n      Sebastopol apple district\r\n      Yucaipa section\r\n    Wisconsin\r\n    Minnesota\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the South and the North, and largely also of the West\r\nand the East, are prevailingly different. Canada has a set of apples\r\nquite its own. These differences are marked when one visits\r\nexhibitions in the various regions. Let the visitor who is a good\r\njudge of apples in Michigan and Ohio attempt to judge them in an\r\nexhibition in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, in the Province of\r\nQuebec, in North Carolina, in Minnesota, in Oregon. He will be\r\nimpressed with the wonderful diversity, as well as the undeveloped\r\nresources, of the continent.\r\n\r\nSouthward, apples do not keep well. There are no true winter apples in\r\nthe Southern States, outside mountain regions. A winter apple of the\r\nNorth becomes a fall apple in the South. In fact, there are marked\r\ndifferences in keeping quality within a single State. On gravelly\r\nlands or warm slopes in the southern part of New York, the Northern\r\nSpy may become practically a late autumn apple; in the northern parts\r\nof the State it is a firm crisp all-winter keeper. In the winter\r\napple, the ripening process proceeds in storage. When the season is so\r\nlong that maturity is reached on the tree, the subsequent duration is\r\nrelatively short.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be inferred, however, that apples are to be grown only in\r\nregions and soils naturally well adapted. Such adaptations should be\r\ncontrolling in commercial plantations; but if man has dominion he\r\nshould be able to accomplish much in untoward or even in hostile\r\nconditions. Even the city lot may be able to yield a harvest, if the\r\noccupant of it is minded in fruits rather than in other things. Every\r\nobservant traveler has noted cases in which good results in the\r\nrearing of plants and animals have been attained in places that no one\r\nwould choose for the purpose: the man has overcome his obstacles. I\r\nwas impressed with this fact in visiting a greenhouse in the Shetland\r\nIslands. Cultivation has been carried far beyond the optimum regions.\r\nThe merit of the man's performance is measured in the excellence of\r\nhis result rather than in the quantity of it. The application of skill\r\nis the highest test of ability in plant-growing, and this is often\r\nexpressed in the most difficult places.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the adaptability of any general territory to the\r\ngrowing of apples in a large way, the probability is that a man of\r\nresources and skill will be able to raise good apples for himself,\r\nunless, of course, the region is prohibitive. The amateur may be a law\r\nunto himself in many of these matters, delighting in the ingenuity\r\nthat enables him to overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE HARVEST OF THE APPLE-TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally the apple is ripe, a fair goodly object joyous in the sun,\r\ninviting to every sense. Hanging amidst its foliage, bending the twig\r\nwith its weight, it is at once a pattern in good shape, perfect in\r\nconfiguration, in sheen beyond imitation, in fragrance the very\r\naffluence of all choice clean growth, its surface spread with a bloom\r\noften so delicate that the unsympathetic see it not; and yet the rains\r\ndo not spoil it.\r\n\r\nThe apple must be picked. Do not let it fall. Probably it is over-ripe\r\nwhen it falls; the hold is loosened; its time is up. Wormy apples may\r\nfall before they are ripe; the worm injury, if it begins early, causes\r\nthem to ripen prematurely. A premature apple is not a good apple,\r\nalbeit the small boy relishes it but only because he may get his apple\r\nearlier; in the apple season, when ripe fruits are abundant, the boy\r\ndoes not choose the wormy one.\r\n\r\nPick the apple from the tree. It will do you good. It is ever so much\r\nbetter than to pick it from a box on the market or out of a quart-can\r\nin the ice-chest. You will feel some sense of responsibility when you\r\npick it, some reaction of relationship to its origin. We know that we\r\nunderstand folks better when we see them at home.\r\n\r\nIn varieties that mature before winter, the apple is of best quality\r\nwhen it ripens on the tree and is picked when fit to eat. In this\r\nrespect it differs from the pear. One reason why store apples are\r\nusually poor is because they must be picked long before ripe to stand\r\nshipment. In my experience it is most difficult to find a man who will\r\npick apples when ripe; he is usually possessed to pull them green,\r\nthinking that if the fruit is full grown and has a red cheek it is\r\ntherefore ready to be plucked.\r\n\r\nOne would expect the best summer and fall apples to come from nearby\r\nlocal orchards, but practically this is not the case because the\r\ngrower will not allow them to remain on the tree until they are fit.\r\nOf course the really ripe apple will not keep long and it does not\r\nstand rough handling, but this does not affect the fact that, for\r\neating, an apple should be naturally ripe. In every city, small or\r\nlarge, a good trade can be built up for local ripe hand-picked fruit\r\nof the first quality, in competition with the best commercial supply.\r\n\r\nWinter apples are picked in the Northern States in October, sometimes\r\nlate in September. They are then full grown, but are hard and\r\ninedible. The red varieties are full colored; the green ones show more\r\nor less yellow. Light early frost does not injure them on the tree.\r\nUsually they are placed at first in piles or windrows; and from these\r\npiles they are barreled or boxed for market. If the choicest grades\r\nare to be made, they should be taken to a packing-house.\r\n\r\nThe apple is an easy fruit to pick. The stem parts readily from the\r\nspur or twig. Yet if the harvester is choice of his trees he will work\r\ndeftly rather than roughly, not to injure the bearing wood. The fruits\r\nare placed in baskets as they are plucked, sometimes in a bag slung\r\nover the shoulders but this is not the best way when the apples are\r\nripe. In the packing-house, the fruits are sorted into uniform grades\r\nif they are for market.\r\n\r\nThe better the trees are tilled, pruned and sprayed, the more uniform\r\nwill be the crop, and particularly if the fruit is thinned on the\r\ntree; yet the second-class and even cull apples will be many under\r\nordinary conditions. The purchaser, noting the price of extra-grade\r\napples, may not realize that he buys only the remainder in a long\r\nprocess of grading, extending really over the season or even\r\nthroughout the life of the orchard. In all this time, the grower has\r\nborne the risks of frosts and hail, insect and fungus invasions, lack\r\nof help, and disastrously low prices. A finished product of high\r\nquality is always expensive.\r\n\r\nThe usual apples on the open market are not the kind I have here tried\r\nto describe. They are the product of indifferent orchards or of\r\ncareless handling. They are purchased for cooking; and the eating of\r\napples out of hand because they are attractive and really good is an\r\nunknown experience with great numbers of our people. The polished\r\nshiny apples of the fruit-stands are a delusion. The practice of\r\nburnishing the fruits produces a most inartistic result, destroying\r\nthe natural bloom and violating the appearance of a natural apple. It\r\nis one thing to clean a fruit if it is soiled (which is seldom the\r\ncase with boxed or barreled apples); it is quite another thing to rub\r\nand furbish an apple as if it were a billiard ball or glass marble and\r\nnot a living object that grew on a tree,--it sets false standards\r\nbefore the children. Yet all this is in line with much of our practice\r\nwhereby, in cookery and manipulation, we disguise our foods and show\r\nour lack of appreciation of the products themselves.\r\n\r\nFor home use, winter apples may well be stored in boxes in a cool\r\nmoist cellar if such a place is available. For best results in long\r\nkeeping, the temperature should be maintained below 40 degrees F. In a\r\ncellar containing a furnace, the fruits shrivel from too much\r\nevaporation, as also in an attic or other dry room. If the fruit must\r\nbe stored in such places, it is well to keep the box or barrel tightly\r\nclosed, and the individual apples may be wrapped in thin paper.\r\n\r\nThe apples must be sorted now and then, to remove the decaying ones;\r\nif the fruit was carefully sprayed, handled and graded in the first\r\nplace and not too ripe, the necessity of frequent sorting will be\r\nconsiderably reduced. But in any case, the keeping of apples, except\r\nunder good cold-storage, is at best a process of continually saving\r\nthe most durable fruits. An \"outside cellar,\" if properly ventilated,\r\nusually is a good place in which to keep apples. With the use of\r\nfurnaces for heating and the cramped quarters of city apartments, the\r\nkeeping of apples for home supply is constantly more difficult.\r\n\r\nThere is no apple like the one that comes up fresh from the cellar on\r\na winter night, cool, crisp, solid yet ready. It is the fruit of the\r\nhome fireside. I often wonder whether one in a hundred of the people\r\nknow what a really good and timely apple is.\r\n\r\nThe yield of an apple-tree depends on many factors,--age, size,\r\nthriftiness, care it has received, whether it has escaped frost and\r\nother injuries; and some varieties are much more prolific than others.\r\nSome apples are \"shy bearers,\" and for this reason soon are lost to\r\npropagation unless they have some superlative merit; Yellow\r\nBellflower is an example of a shy, or at least an irregular, bearer.\r\nThe great commercial varieties are of course good bearers, as Baldwin,\r\nBen Davis, Stayman, York Imperial, Oldenburg, Rome, McIntosh, Wealthy,\r\nYellow Transparent, Jonathan.\r\n\r\nAn apple-tree at full bearing is a wonderful sight at the harvest,\r\nparticularly in such varieties as McIntosh and Baldwin, in which the\r\nfruit is highly colored and hangs well toward the outside of the\r\ntree-top. While the first bearing year may yield only a half dozen\r\nfruits, the crop increases rapidly with the added years,--one peck,\r\none bushel, five bushels, ten bushels, thirty bushels, even to sixty\r\nand seventy bushels on large sturdy old trees of some varieties. The\r\namateur, however, first prizes the quality and regularity of his\r\nproduct for the sheer joy of it; then every added bushel is so much to\r\nthe good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nTHE APPRAISAL OF THE APPLE-TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, in these sixteen little chapters have I tried to\r\nexplain what I feel about the apple-tree. It is a version to my\r\nfriend, the reader, not a treatise.\r\n\r\nAs the interpretation is in the realm of the sensibilities, so do I\r\naim not directly at concreteness. Yet as it is now the fashion to\r\n\"score\" all our products by a scale of \"points,\" I make a reasonable\r\nconcession to it. But I do not like the scoring of the fruit\r\nindependently of the tree on which it grew as if the fruit were only a\r\ncommodity. I know we cannot bring the tree to the exhibition-room, yet\r\nthe perfect measure, nevertheless, is the tree and the fruit together.\r\nIn these later times we have said much against the use of the museum\r\nspecimen to the exclusion of the living object in its natural place:\r\nlet us be cautious, then, that we do not forget apple-trees in our\r\nstudies of apples.\r\n\r\nHere I shall not arrange numerical scales of points for the\r\napple-tree. Sufficient for this occasion is the naming of the points,\r\nletting the reader place his own percentage-value on each of them; for\r\nI am trying to teach, not to instruct.\r\n\r\nYet I must insert, for the reader's benefit, certain good rules and\r\nscores that have been adopted for the \"judging\" of the fruit by those\r\nexperienced in these matters. This excellent exercise of judging\r\nfruits at exhibitions has gained much headway. Students of schools and\r\ncolleges are trained for the \"judging teams,\" and great technical\r\nperfection has been attained.\r\n\r\nTo be exact is an exigency of science. I fear that we make exactness\r\nan end, but that is neither here nor there on this occasion and I\r\nshall not now pursue the subject further; I hope the judging trains\r\nthe judge to see what he looks at in other things as well as in\r\napples, that it leads him into the pleasant paths of causes and\r\neffects, that it opens the eyes of the blind.\r\n\r\nThe customary judging of plants and animals and their products\r\nconsists in assessing the attributes against a scale of perfection.\r\nThus, if \"form\" or \"conformation\" is worth 10 points in the hundred\r\n(by the estimation of good authorities), the judge must decide whether\r\nthe particular animal before him merits 6 or 7, more or less. So if\r\n\"flavor\" in an apple is considered to be worth 20 points of the\r\nhundred, the judge makes up his mind what rating, within that limit,\r\nhe shall accord to the fruit he is testing. The arrangement in tabular\r\nform of the features for any product, with the number of points stated\r\nfor each, all summing 100, constitutes a \"score-card.\" Thus there may\r\nbe a score-card for Merino sheep, another for Shropshires, one for\r\napples, and for any other objects whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAt competitive exhibitions, the element of comparison comes in.\r\nPerhaps it is the only criterion to be considered in a particular\r\ncase,--whether this apple is better than that or than any number of\r\nothers, which of several \"plates\" or samples of apples merits first\r\nmention, which of two or more collections of varieties is altogether\r\nmost worthy of a prize. In these cases, the different fruits or\r\ncollections may be scored by the card, and the total footings\r\ndetermine where the award shall go. Or, the different entries may be\r\njudged in general, \"by the eye;\" this is the usual method, and is\r\nsatisfactory in the hands of persons whose standing and experience\r\ncarry conviction.\r\n\r\nIf one is to evaluate an apple-tree against a scale or code, these are\r\nsome of the features, in relative order of importance, to be\r\nconsidered:\r\n\r\n     1. Whether the tree is typical of the variety, in shape,\r\n     manner of growth, character of foliage and bloom.\r\n\r\n     2. Whether it is sound of all injury and disease, and free\r\n     of blemish.\r\n\r\n     3. Whether it is duly vigorous and productive.\r\n\r\n     4. Whether its fruit is characteristic of the variety or\r\n     kind.\r\n\r\n     5. Whether the pruning has been good; the thinning; the\r\n     spraying.\r\n\r\n     6. Whether the performance of the tree has fulfilled\r\n     reasonable expectations.\r\n\r\nThe judging of fruits is facilitated by such score-cards and\r\nexplanations as the following:\r\n\r\n     1.

All specimens on a plate\r\n     should be uniform in shape. When competition is close, a\r\n     careful comparison of the more minute characteristics of the\r\n     basin, cavity and stem are made.\r\n\r\n     (2) _Size_: The specimens on any one plate should be uniform\r\n     in size and of the size most acceptable on the market for\r\n     the variety. A plate may be marked down for being either\r\n     under or over the accepted commercial size. In many\r\n     exhibits, the ideal size is given in the premium\r\n     announcements.\r\n\r\n     (3) _Colors_: All specimens in an entry should be uniformly\r\n     colored in the way that is considered perfect for the\r\n     variety in the district where grown. In judging color, one\r\n     should consider (_a_) the depth and attractiveness of the\r\n     ground color, (_b_) the brightness and attractiveness of the\r\n     over-color, (_c_) the amount of the over-color. In a yellow\r\n     or green apple, the yellow or green should be clear and even\r\n     all over, considering the maturity of the specimen. In\r\n     varieties that are typically blushed, (e. g., Maiden Blush)\r\n     the specimens should show a distinct tinge of red on the\r\n     cheek exposed to the sun. With such apples as Rhode Island\r\n     Greening, that are only sometimes blushed, the presence or\r\n     absence of the blush should not detract except that the\r\n     apples on any one plate should be uniform. With apples\r\n     typically over-colored, an intense color for the variety is\r\n     desirable.\r\n\r\n     The _bloom_ may be wiped from apples, but in no case should\r\n     polished specimens be given the preference. Some exhibits\r\n     have special rules regarding polishing of apples.\r\n\r\n     (4) _Conditions_: Refers to the degree of ripeness. An apple\r\n     to be in perfect condition should be firm for the variety\r\n     and free from the withering that comes when apples are\r\n     picked too green or when the fruit is over-ripe or has not\r\n     been stored properly.\r\n\r\n     (5) _Freedom from blemish_: All specimens should be free\r\n     from blemishes of all kinds. One should look particularly\r\n     for (_a_) marks of fungous or other disease, including\r\n     stippin, (_b_) injury from insects of all kinds, (_c_)\r\n     mechanical injury, including loss of stem. Unmistakable\r\n     evidence of codlin-moth injury or San José scale should\r\n     disqualify a plate. Other blemishes are considered important\r\n     in about the order named: Side worms, scab, stippin,\r\n     curculio or red-bug, skin punctures, bruises, stem pulled,\r\n     russet (not typical for variety) and limb rub. The extent of\r\n     scab spots should be considered. Minute spots are not as\r\n     serious as some other blemishes, while spots which deform\r\n     the apple should disqualify the plate.\r\n\r\n     _Other information_: Five specimens constitute a plate,\r\n     except when the rules of the contest or exhibit state\r\n     otherwise. Any variation from this rule disqualifies the\r\n     plate.\r\n\r\n     When a plate is not labelled with the correct variety name,\r\n     it should not be judged, but is disqualified and if possible\r\n     the correct name is applied. If one specimen on a plate is\r\n     not as labelled, the whole plate is disqualified.\r\n\r\n     In some judging contests, the plates are not labelled with\r\n     the variety name, and the contestant is supposed to make the\r\n     identification.\r\n\r\n     _Precaution_: Avoid pressing the specimens with the thumb\r\n     and finger so as to bruise the fruit. The degree of firmness\r\n     can be determined by gentle pressure with the inside of the\r\n     whole hand.\r\n\r\n     Defects, apparent or otherwise, should not be probed with\r\n     the finger nail, pin, or other hard object.\r\n\r\n     Special care should be exercised to replace all specimens on\r\n     the right plate.\r\n\r\nHaving in mind these definite criteria, the reader will know what is\r\nmeant by a \"good apple\" and also a good apple-tree. Measurements of\r\nperfection aid us to estimate the deficiencies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe who knows the apple-tree knows also its region. The landscape is\r\nhis in every blessed year; he sees the chariots of the months come\r\ndown from the distances and pass by him into the twilights. Clouds are\r\nhis and the repeating shadows on the hills. The morning when the\r\nblossoms are laden with the fragrance of the night, high noon when the\r\nbees are busy, the gloaming when the birds drop into the boughs, these\r\nare his by divine right. The smell of new-plowed fields is his, with\r\nthe urgent promise in them. Seed time and harvest, as old as the\r\nprocreant earth and as new as the latest sunrise, are his to conjure.\r\nThe verities are his for the asking, the strong things of cultivated\r\nfields and of wild places. And mastery is his, that comes of the\r\namelioration of the land and the education of the tree. All these are\r\neveryman's, and yet they are his alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PAGE\r\n\r\nAcid phosphate                     45\r\n\r\nAge of apple-trees                 98\r\n\r\nAlternate bearing                  42\r\n\r\nAmerican Pomological Society       66\r\n\r\nApple-scab                         95\r\n\r\nAppleseed, Johnny                  61\r\n\r\nArsenate of lead                   95\r\n\r\nAustralia, Apples in               97\r\n\r\n\r\nBacteria                           12\r\n\r\nBark of apple-tree                 11\r\n  of cherry                        11\r\n  of elm                           11\r\n  of pear-tree                     11\r\n\r\nBearing year                       42\r\n\r\nBlack Gilliflower                  73\r\n\r\nBloomless apple                    75\r\n\r\nBolting trees                      88\r\n\r\nBridge-grafting                    88\r\n\r\nBrush pile                         27\r\n\r\nBudding                        50, 51\r\n\r\nBuds                       15, 19, 27\r\n\r\n\r\nCalyx-tube                         26\r\n\r\nCanada, apples in                  98\r\n\r\nCanker                             12\r\n\r\nCherimoya                           8\r\n\r\nCherry, bark of                    11\r\n\r\nChristophine                        8\r\n\r\nCider, treatise on                 62\r\n\r\nCion-grafting                  50, 79\r\n\r\nCitrus fruits                       8\r\n\r\nCleft-grafting                     82\r\n\r\nCoconut                             8\r\n\r\nCodlin-moth                    12, 89\r\n\r\nCustard apple                       8\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases                           46\r\n\r\nDistance apart                     43\r\n\r\nDouble apples                      74\r\n\r\nDoucin stocks                      57\r\n\r\nDowning, quoted                54, 67\r\n\r\nDwarf apple-trees                  54\r\n\r\n\r\nElm, bark of                       11\r\n\r\nEndicott, Gov.                     61\r\n\r\nEnriching the land                 45\r\n\r\nExhibitions                       108\r\n\r\n\r\nFertilizing                40, 44, 45\r\n\r\nFig                                 8\r\n\r\nFlower, structure of               20\r\n\r\nFolger and Thomson, quoted         98\r\n\r\nFructicetum                        78\r\n\r\nFruit-spurs and bearing            42\r\n\r\nFungi                              12\r\n\r\n\r\nGirdles                            87\r\n\r\nGraftage                       49, 79\r\n\r\nGrafts                             81\r\n\r\nGuava                               8\r\n\r\n\r\nHarvesting                        102\r\n\r\nHillsides for orchards             44\r\n\r\nHogs in orchards                   45\r\n\r\nHypanthium                         26\r\n\r\n\r\nInsects                        46, 89\r\n\r\n\r\nJudging apples                    108\r\n\r\n\r\nKnots                      11, 85, 87\r\n\r\n\r\nLand for apples                    42\r\n\r\nLangley, Batty                     82\r\n\r\nLawson, William                    82\r\n\r\nLeaf-arrangement                   29\r\n\r\nLichens                            11\r\n\r\nLime-sulphur                       95\r\n\r\nLinnaeus                           62\r\n\r\nLintner, J.
