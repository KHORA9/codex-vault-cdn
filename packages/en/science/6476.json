HOOKER\r\nKew, Jan. 12th, 1854\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nHAVING accompanied Sir James Boss on his voyage of discovery to the\r\nAntarctic regions, where botany was my chief pursuit, on my return I\r\nearnestly desired to add to my acquaintance with the natural history\r\nof the temperate zones, more knowledge of that of the tropics than I\r\nbad hitherto had the opportunity of acquiring. My choice lay between\r\nIndia and the Andes, and I decided upon the former, being principally\r\ninfluenced by Dr. Falconer, who promised me every assistance which\r\nhis position as Superintendent of the H.E.I.C. Botanic Garden at\r\nCalcutta, would enable hum to give. He also drew my attention to the\r\nfact that we were ignorant even of the geography of the central and\r\neastern parts of these mountains, while all to the north was involved\r\nin a mystery equally attractive to the traveller and the naturalist.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the kind interest taken by Baron Humboldt in my\r\nproposed travels, and at the request of my father (Sir William\r\nHooker), the Earl of Carlisle (then Chief Commissioner of Woods and\r\nForests) undertook to represent to Her Majesty's Government the\r\nexpediency of securing my collections for the Royal Gardens at Kew;\r\nand owing to the generous exertions of that nobleman, and of the late\r\nEarl of Auckland (then First Lord of the Admiralty), my journey\r\nassumed the character of a Government mission, £400 per annum being\r\ngranted by the Treasury for two years.\r\n\r\nI did not contemplate proceeding beyond the Himalaya and Tibet, when\r\nLord Auckland desired that I should afterwards visit Borneo, for the\r\npurpose of reporting on the capabilities of Labuan, with reference to\r\nthe cultivation of cotton, tobacco, sugar, indigo, spices,\r\nguttapercha, etc. To this end a commission in the navy (to which\r\nservice I was already attached) was given me, such instructions were\r\ndrawn up as might facilitate my movements in the East, and a suitable\r\nsum of money was placed at my disposal.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving England, my plans became, from various causes,\r\naltered. The Earl of Auckland* [It is with a melancholy satisfaction\r\nthat I here record the intentions of that enlightened nobleman.\r\nThe idea of turning to public account what was intended as a\r\nscientific voyage, occurred to his lordship when considering my\r\napplication for official leave to proceed to India; and from the hour\r\nof my accepting the Borneo commission with which he honoured me, he\r\ndisplayed the most active zeal in promoting its fulfilment.\r\nHe communicated to me his views as to the direction in which I should\r\npursue my researches, furnished me with official and other\r\ninformation, and provided me with introductions of the most essential\r\nuse.] was dead; the interest in Borneo had in a great measure\r\nsubsided; H.M.S. \"Maeander,\" to which I had been attached for service\r\nin Labuan, had left the Archipelago; reports of the unhealthy nature\r\nof the coast had excited alarm; and the results of my researches in\r\nthe Himalaya had proved of more interest and advantage than had been\r\nanticipated. It was hence thought expedient to cancel the Borneo\r\nappointment, and to prolong my services for a third year in India;\r\nfor which purpose a grant of £300 (originally intended for defraying\r\nthe expense of collecting only, in Borneo) was transferred as salary\r\nfor the additional year to be spent in the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the Himalaya best worth exploring, was selected for me\r\nboth by Lord Auckland and Dr. Falconer, who independently recommended\r\nSikkim, as being ground untrodden by traveller or naturalist.\r\nIts ruler was, moreover, all but a dependant of the British\r\ngovernment, and it was supposed, would therefore be glad to\r\nfacilitate my researches.\r\n\r\nNo part of the snowy Himalaya eastward of the northwest extremity of\r\nthe British possessions had been visited since Turner's embassy to\r\nTibet in 1789; and hence it was highly important to explore\r\nscientifically a part of the chain which, from its central position,\r\nmight be presumed to be typical of the whole range. The possibility\r\nof visiting Tibet, and of ascertaining particulars respecting the\r\ngreat mountain Chumulari,* [My earliest recollections in reading are\r\nof \"Turner's Travels in Tibet,\" and of \"Cook's Voyages.\" The account\r\nof Lama worship and of Chumulari in the one, and of Kerguelen's Land\r\nin the other, always took a strong hold on my fancy. It is,\r\ntherefore, singular that Kerguelen's Land should have been the first\r\nstrange country I ever visited (now fourteen years ago), and that in\r\nthe first King's ship which has touched there since Cook's voyage,\r\nand whilst following the track of that illustrious navigator in south\r\npolar discovery. At a later period I have been nearly the first\r\nEuropean who has approached Chumulari since Turner's embassy.] which\r\nwas only known from Turner's account, were additional inducements to\r\na student of physical geography; but it was not then known that\r\nKinchinjunga, the loftiest known mountain on the globe, was situated\r\non my route, and formed a principal feature in the physical geography\r\nof Sikkim.\r\n\r\nMy passage to Egypt was provided by the Admiralty in H.M.\r\nsteam-vessel \"Sidon,\" destined to convey the Marquis of Dalhousie,\r\nGovernor-General of India, thus far on his way. On his arrival in\r\nEgypt, his Lordship did me the honour of desiring me to consider\r\nmyself in the position of one of his suite, for the remainder of the\r\nvoyage, which was performed in the \"Moozuffer,\" a steam frigate\r\nbelonging to the Indian Navy. My obligations to this nobleman had\r\ncommenced before leaving England, by his promising me every facility\r\nhe could command; and he thus took the earliest opportunity of\r\naffording it, by giving me such a position near himself as ensured me\r\nthe best reception everywhere; no other introduction being needed.\r\nHis Lordship procured my admission into Sikkim, and honoured me\r\nthroughout my travels with the kindest encouragement.\r\n\r\nDuring the passage out, some days were spent in Egypt, at Aden,\r\nCeylon, and Madras. I have not thought it necessary to give here the\r\nobservations made in those well-known countries; they are detailed in\r\na series of letters published in the \"London Journal of Botany,\" as\r\nwritten for my private friends. Arriving at Calcutta in January, I\r\npassed the remainder of the cold season in making myself acquainted\r\nwith the vegetation of the plains and hills of Western Bengal, south\r\nof the Ganges, by a journey across the mountains of Birbhoom and\r\nBehar to the Soane valley, and thence over the Vindhya range to the\r\nGanges, at Mirzapore, whence I descended that stream to Bhaugulpore;\r\nand leaving my boat, struck north to the Sikkim Himalaya. This\r\nexcursion is detailed in the \"London Journal of Botany,\" and the\r\nAsiatic Society of Bengal honoured me by printing the meteorological\r\nobservations made during its progress.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years' residence in Sikkim which succeeded, I was laid\r\nunder obligations of no ordinary nature to Brian H. Hodgson, Esq.,\r\nB.C.S., for many years Resident at the Nepal Court; whose guest I\r\nbecame for several months. Mr. Hodgson's high position as a man of\r\nscience requires no mention here; but the difficulties he overcame,\r\nand the sacrifices he made, in attaining that position, are known to\r\nfew. He entered the wilds of Nepal when very young, and in\r\nindifferent health; and finding time to spare, cast about for the\r\nbest method of employing it: he had no one to recommend or direct a\r\npursuit, no example to follow, no rival to equal or surpass; he had\r\nnever been acquainted with a scientific man, and knew nothing of\r\nscience except the name. The natural history of men and animals, in\r\nits most comprehensive sense, attracted his attention; he sent to\r\nEurope for books, and commenced the study of ethnology and zoology.\r\nHis labours have now extended over upwards of twenty-five years'\r\nresidence in the Himalaya. During this period he has seldom had a\r\nstaff of less than from ten to twenty persons (often many more), of\r\nvarious tongues and races, employed as translators and collectors,\r\nartists, shooters, and stuffers. By unceasing exertions and a\r\nprincely liberality, Mr. Hodgson has unveiled the mysteries of the\r\nBoodhist religion, chronicled the affinities, languages, customs, and\r\nfaiths of the Himalayan tribes; and completed a natural history of\r\nthe animals and birds of these regions. His collections of specimens\r\nare immense, and are illustrated by drawings and descriptions taken\r\nfrom life, with remarks on the anatomy,* [In this department he\r\navailed himself of the services of Dr. Campbell, who was also\r\nattached to the Residency at Nepal, as surgeon and assistant\r\npolitical agent.] habits, and localities of the animals themselves.\r\nTwenty volumes of the Journals, and the Museum of the Asiatic Society\r\nof Bengal, teem with the proofs of his indefatigable zeal; and\r\nthroughout the cabinets of the bird and quadruped departments of our\r\nnational museum, Mr. Hodgson's name stands pre-eminent. A seat in the\r\nInstitute of France, and the cross of the Legion of Honour, prove the\r\nestimation in which his Boodhist studies are held on the continent of\r\nEurope. To be welcomed to the Himalaya by such a person, and to be\r\nallowed the most unreserved intercourse, and the advantage of all his\r\ninformation and library, exercised a material influence on the\r\nprogress I made in my studies, and on my travels. When I add that\r\nmany of the subjects treated of in these volumes were discussed\r\nbetween us, it will be evident that it is impossible for me to divest\r\nmuch of the information thus insensibly obtained, of the appearance\r\nof being the fruits of my own research.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell, the Superintendent of Dorjiling, is likewise the\r\nGovernor-General's agent, or medium of communication between the\r\nBritish Government and the Sikkim Rajah; and as such, invested with\r\nmany discretionary powers. In the course of this narrative, I shall\r\ngive a sketch of the rise, progress, and prospects of the Sanatarium,\r\nor Health-station of Dorjiling, and of the anomalous position held by\r\nthe Sikkim Rajah. The latter circumstance led indirectly to the\r\ndetention of Dr. Campbell (who joined me in one of my journeys) and\r\nmyself, by a faction of the Sikkim court, for the purpose of\r\nobtaining from the Indian Government a more favourable treaty than\r\nthat then existing. This mode of enforcing a request by _douce\r\nviolence_ and detention, is common with the turbulent tribes east\r\nof Nepal, but was in this instance aggravated by violence towards my\r\nfellow-prisoner, through the ill will of the persons who executed the\r\norders of their superiors, and who had been punished by Dr. Campbell\r\nfor crimes committed against both the British and Nepalese\r\ngovernments. The circumstances of this outrage were misunderstood at\r\nthe time; its instigators were supposed to be Chinese; its\r\nperpetrators Tibetans; and we the offenders were assumed to have\r\nthrust ourselves into the country, without authority from our own\r\ngovernment, and contrary to the will of the Sikkim Rajah; who was\r\nimagined to be a tributary of China, and protected by that nation,\r\nand to be under no obligation to the East Indian government.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the obligations I owe to Dr. Campbell, I confine\r\nmyself to saying that his whole aim was to promote my comfort, and to\r\nsecure my success, in all possible ways. Every object I had in view\r\nwas as sedulously cared for by him as by myself: I am indebted to his\r\ninfluence with Jung Bahadoor* [It was in Nepal that Dr. Campbell\r\ngained the friendship of Jung Bahadoor, the most remarkable proof of\r\nwhich is the acceding to his request, and granting me leave to visit\r\nthe eastern parts of his dominions; no European that I am aware of,\r\nhaving been allowed, either before or since, to travel anywhere\r\nexcept to and from the plains of India and valley of Katmandu, in\r\nwhich the capital city and British residency are situated.] for the\r\npermission to traverse his dominions, and to visit the Tibetan passes\r\nof Nepal. His prudence and patience in negotiating with the Sikkim\r\ncourt, enabled me to pursue my investigations in that country. My\r\njournal is largely indebted to his varied and extensive knowledge of\r\nthe people and productions of these regions.\r\n\r\nIn all numerical calculations connected with my observations, I\r\nreceived most essential aid from John Muller, Esq., Accountant of the\r\nCalcutta Mint, and from his brother, Charles Muller, Esq., of Patna,\r\nboth ardent amateurs in scientific pursuits, and who employed\r\nthemselves in making meteorological observations at Dorjiling, where\r\nthey were recruiting constitutions impaired by the performance of\r\narduous duties in the climate of the plains. I cannot sufficiently\r\nthank these gentlemen for the handsome manner in which they\r\nvolunteered me their assistance in these laborious operations.\r\nMr. J. Muller resided at Dorjiling during eighteen months of my stay\r\nin Sikkim, over the whole of which period his generous zeal in my\r\nservice never relaxed; he assisted me in the reduction of many\r\nhundreds of my observations for latitude, time, and elevation,\r\nbesides adjusting and rating my instruments; and I can recall no more\r\npleasant days than those thus spent with these hospitable friends.\r\n\r\nThanks to Dr. Falconer's indefatigable exertions, such of my\r\ncollections as reached Calcutta were forwarded to England in\r\nexcellent order; and they were temporarily deposited in Kew Gardens\r\nuntil their destination should be determined. On my return home, my\r\nscientific friends interested themselves in procuring from the\r\nGovernment such aid as might enable me to devote the necessary time\r\nto the arrangement, naming, and distributing of my collections, the\r\npublication of my manuscripts, etc. I am in this most deeply indebted\r\nto the disinterested and generous exertions of Mr. L. Horner, Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, Dr. Lindley, Professor E. Forbes, and many others; and\r\nmost especially to the Presidents of the Royal Society (the Earl of\r\nRosse), of the Linnean (Mr. R. Brown), and Geological (Mr. Hopkins),\r\nwho in their official capacities memorialized in person the Chief\r\nCommissioner of Woods and Forests on this subject; Sir William Hooker\r\nat the same time bringing it under the notice of the First Lord of\r\nthe Treasury. The result was a grant of £400 annually for three years.\r\n\r\nDr. T. Thomson joined me in Dorjiling in the end of 1849, after the\r\ncompletion of his arduous journeys in the North-West Himalaya and\r\nTibet, and we spent the year 1850 in travelling and collecting,\r\nreturning to England together in 1851. Having obtained permission\r\nfrom the Indian Government to distribute his botanical collections,\r\nwhich equal my own in extent and value, we were advised by all our\r\nbotanical friends to incorporate, and thus to distribute them. The\r\nwhole constitute an Herbarium of from 6000 to 7000 species of Indian\r\nplants, including an immense number of duplicates; and it is now in\r\nprocess of being arranged and named, by Dr. Thomson and myself,\r\npreparatory to its distribution amongst sixty of the principal public\r\nand private herbaria in Europe, India, and the United States\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nFor the information of future travellers, I may state that the total\r\nexpense of my Indian journey, including outfit, three years and a\r\nhalf travelling, and the sending of my collections to Calcutta, was\r\nunder £2000 (of which £1200 were defrayed by government), but would\r\nhave come to much more, had I not enjoyed the great advantages I have\r\ndetailed. This sum does not include the purchase of books and\r\ninstruments, with which I supplied myself, and which cost about £200,\r\nnor the freight of the collections to England, which was paid by\r\nGovernment. Owing to the kind services of Mr. J. C. Melvill,\r\nSecretary of the India House, many small parcels of seeds, etc., were\r\nconveyed to England, free of cost; and I have to record my great\r\nobligations and sincere thanks to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam\r\nNavigation Company, for conveying, without charge, all small parcels\r\nof books, instruments and specimens, addressed to or by myself.\r\n\r\nIt remains to say something of the illustrations of this work.\r\nThe maps are from surveys of my own, made chiefly with my own\r\ninstruments, but partly with some valuable ones for the use of which\r\nI am indebted to my friend Captain H. Thuillier, Deputy\r\nSurveyor-General of India, who placed at my disposal the resources of\r\nthe magnificent establishment under his control, and to whose\r\ninnumerable good offices I am very greatly beholden.\r\n\r\nThe landscapes, etc. have been prepared chiefly from my own drawings,\r\nand will, I hope, be found to be tolerably faithful representations\r\nof the scenes. I have always endeavoured to overcome that tendency to\r\nexaggerate heights, and increase the angle of slopes, which is I\r\nbelieve the besetting sin, not of amateurs only, but of our most\r\naccomplished artists. As, however, I did not use instruments in\r\nprojecting the outlines, I do not pretend to have wholly avoided this\r\nsnare; nor, I regret to say; has the lithographer, in all cases, been\r\ncontent to abide by his copy. My drawings will be considered tame\r\ncompared with most mountain landscapes, though the subjects comprise\r\nsome of the grandest scenes in nature. Considering how conventional\r\nthe treatment of such subjects is, and how unanimous artists seem to\r\nbe as to the propriety of exaggerating those features which should\r\npredominate in the landscape, it may fairly be doubted whether the\r\ntotal effect of steepness and elevation, especially in a mountain\r\nview, can, on a small scale, be conveyed by a strict adherence to\r\ntruth. I need hardly add, that if such is attainable, it is only by\r\nthose who have a power of colouring that few pretend to. In the list\r\nof plates and woodcuts I have mentioned the obligations I am under to\r\nseveral friends for the use of drawings, etc.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the spelling of native names, after much anxious\r\ndiscussion I have adopted that which assimilates most to the English\r\npronunciation. For great assistance in this, for a careful revision\r\nof the sheets as they passed through the press, and for numerous\r\nvaluable suggestions throughout, I am indebted to my\r\nfellow-traveller, Dr. Thomas Thomson.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSunderbunds vegetation -- Calcutta Botanic Garden -- Leave for\r\nBurdwan -- Rajah's gardens and menagerie -- Coal-beds, geology, and\r\nplants of -- Lac insect and plant -- Camels -- Kunker -- Cowage --\r\nEffloresced soda on soil -- Glass, manufacture of -- Atmospheric\r\nvapours -- Temperature, etc. -- Mahowa oil and spirits -- Maddaobund\r\n-- Jains -- Ascent of Paras-nath -- Vegetation of that mountain.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDoomree -- Vegetation of table-land -- Lieutenant Beadle -- Birds --\r\nHot springs of Soorujkoond -- Plants near them -- Shells in them --\r\nCholera-tree -- Olibanum -- Palms, form of -- Dunwah pass -- Trees,\r\nnative and planted  -- Wild peacock -- Poppy fields -- Geography and\r\ngeology of Behar and Central India -- Toddy-palm -- Ground,\r\ntemperature of -- Baroon -- Temperature of plants -- Lizard -- Cross\r\nthe Soane -- Sand, ripple-marks on -- Kymore hills -- Ground,\r\ntemperature of -- Limestone -- Rotas fort and palace -- Nitrate of\r\nlime -- Change of climate -- Lime stalagmites, enclosing leaves --\r\nFall of Soane -- Spiders, etc. -- Scenery and natural history of\r\nupper Soane valley -- _Hardwickia binata_ -- Bhel fruit --\r\nDust-storm --  Alligator -- Catechu -- _Cochlospermum_ --\r\nLeaf-bellows -- Scorpions -- Tortoises -- Florican -- Limestone\r\nspheres -- Coles -- Tiger-hunt -- Robbery.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEk-powa Ghat -- Sandstones -- Shahgunj -- Table-land, elevation, etc.\r\n-- Gum-arabic -- Mango -- Fair -- Aquatic plants -- Rujubbund --\r\nStorm -- False sunset and sunrise -- Bind hills -- Mirzapore --\r\nManufactures, imports, etc. -- Climate -- Thuggee -- Chunar --\r\nBenares -- Mosque -- Observatory -- Sar-nath --  Ghazeepore --\r\nRose-gardens -- Manufactory of attar -- Lord Cornwallis' tomb --\r\nGanges, scenery and natural history of -- Pelicans -- Vegetation --\r\nInsects -- Dinapore -- Patna -- Opium godowns and manufacture --\r\nMudar, white and purple -- Monghyr islets -- Hot springs of\r\nSeetakoond -- Alluvium of Ganges -- Rocks of Sultun-gunj --\r\nBhaugulpore -- Temples of Mt.

On the 12th of January, 1848, the \"Moozuffer\" was\r\nsteaming amongst the low swampy islands of the Sunderbunds.\r\nThese exhibit no tropical luxuriance, and are, in this respect,\r\nexceedingly disappointing. A low vegetation covers them, chiefly made\r\nup of a dwarf-palm (_Phoenix paludosa_) and small mangroves, with a\r\nfew scattered trees on the higher bank that runs along the water's\r\nedge, consisting of fan-palm, toddy-palm, and _Terminalia._ Every now\r\nand then, the paddles of the steamer tossed up the large fruits of\r\n_Nipa fruticans,_ a low stemless palm that grows in the tidal waters\r\nof the Indian ocean, and bears a large head of nuts. It is a plant of\r\nno interest to the common observer, but of much to the geologist, from\r\nthe nuts of a similar plant abounding in the tertiary formations at\r\nthe mouth of the Thames, and having floated about there in as great\r\nprofusion as here, till buried deep in the silt and mud that now forms\r\nthe island of Sheppey.* [Bowerbank \"On the Fossil Fruits and Seeds of\r\nthe Isle of Sheppey,\" and Lyell's \"Elements of Geology,\" 3rd ed. p.\r\n201.]\r\n\r\nHigher up, the river Hoogly is entered, and large trees, with\r\nvillages and cultivation, replace the sandy spits and marshy jungles\r\nof the great Gangetic delta. A few miles below Calcutta, the scenery\r\nbecomes beautiful, beginning with the Botanic Garden, once the\r\nresidence of Roxburgh and Wallich, and now of Falconer,--classical\r\nground to the naturalist. Opposite are the gardens of Sir Lawrence\r\nPeel; unrivalled in India for their beauty and cultivation, and\r\nfairly entitled to be called the Chatsworth of Bengal. A little\r\nhigher up, Calcutta opened out, with the batteries of Fort William in\r\nthe foreground, thundering forth a salute, and in a few minutes more\r\nall other thoughts were absorbed in watching the splendour of the\r\narrangements made for the reception of the Governor-General of India.\r\n\r\nDuring my short stay in Calcutta, I was principally occupied in\r\npreparing for an excursion with Mr. Williams of the Geological\r\nSurvey, who was about to move his camp from the Damooda valley\r\ncoal-fields, near Burdwan, to Beejaghur on the banks of the Soane,\r\nwhere coal was reported to exist, in the immediate vicinity of\r\nwater-carriage, the great desideratum of the Burdwan fields.\r\n\r\nMy time was spent partly at Government-House, and partly at Sir\r\nLawrence Peel's residence. The former I was kindly invited to\r\nconsider as my Indian home, an honour which I appreciate the more\r\nhighly, as the invitation was accompanied with the assurance that I\r\nshould have entire freedom to follow my own pursuits; and the\r\nadvantages which such a position afforded me, were, I need not say,\r\nof no ordinary kind.\r\n\r\nAt the Botanic Gardens I received every assistance from Dr.\r\nMcLelland,* [Dr. Falconer's _locum tenens,_ then in temporary\r\ncharge of the establishment.] who was very busy, superintending the\r\npublication of the botanical papers and drawings of his friend, the\r\nlate Dr. Griffith, for which native artists were preparing copies on\r\nlithographic paper.\r\n\r\nOf the Gardens themselves it is exceedingly difficult to speak; the\r\nchanges had been so very great, and from a state with which I had no\r\nacquaintance. There had been a great want of judgment in the\r\nalterations made since Dr. Wallich's time, when they were celebrated\r\nas the most beautiful gardens in the east, and were the great object\r\nof attraction to strangers and townspeople. I found instead an\r\nunsightly wilderness, without shade (the first requirement of every\r\ntropical garden) or other beauties than some isolated grand trees,\r\nwhich had survived the indiscriminate destruction of the useful and\r\nornamental which had attended the well-meant but ill-judged attempt\r\nto render a garden a botanical class-book. It is impossible to praise\r\ntoo highly Dr. Griffith's abilities and acquirements as a botanist,\r\nhis perseverance and success as a traveller, or his matchless\r\nindustry in the field and in the closet; and it is not wonderful,\r\nthat, with so many and varied talents, he should have wanted the eye\r\nof a landscape-gardener, or the education of a horticulturist.\r\nI should, however, be wanting in my duty to his predecessor, and to\r\nhis no less illustrious successor, were these remarks withheld,\r\nproceeding, as they do, from an unbiassed observer, who had the\r\nhonour of standing in an equally friendly relation to all parties.\r\nBefore leaving India, I saw great improvements, but many years must\r\nelapse before the gardens can resume their once proud pre-eminence.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to find the Botanical Gardens looked upon by many of\r\nthe Indian public, and even by some of the better informed official\r\nmen, as rather an extravagant establishment, more ornamental than\r\nuseful. These persons seemed astonished to learn that its name was\r\nrenowned throughout Europe, and that during the first twenty years\r\nespecially of Dr. Wallich's superintendence, it had contributed more\r\nuseful and ornamental tropical plants to the public and private\r\ngardens of the world than any other establishment before or since.*\r\n[As an illustration of this, I may refer to a Report presented to the\r\ngovernment of Bengal, from which it appears that between January,\r\n1836, and December, 1840, 189,932 plants were distributed gratis to\r\nnearly 2000 different gardens.] I speak from a personal knowledge of\r\nthe contents of our English gardens, and our colonial ones at the\r\nCape, and in Australia, and from an inspection of the ponderous\r\nvolumes of distribution lists, to which Dr. Falconer is daily adding.\r\nThe botanical public of Europe and India is no less indebted than the\r\nhorticultural to the liberality of the Hon. East India Company, and\r\nto the energy of the several eminent men who have carried their views\r\ninto execution.* [I here allude to the great Indian herbarium,\r\nchiefly formed by the staff of the Botanic Gardens under the\r\ndirection of Dr. Wallich, and distributed in 1829 to the principal\r\nmuseums of Europe. This is the most valuable contribution of the kind\r\never made to science, and it is a lasting memorial: of the princely\r\nliberality of the enlightened men who ruled the counsels of India in\r\nthose days. No botanical work of importance has been published since\r\n1829, without recording its sense of the obligation, and I was once\r\ncommissioned by a foreign government, to purchase for its national\r\nmuseum, at whatever cost, one set of these collections, which was\r\nbrought to the hammer on the death of its possessor. I have heard it\r\nremarked that the expense attending the distribution was enormous,\r\nand I have reason to know that this erroneous impression has had an\r\nunfavourable influence upon the destination of scarcely less valuable\r\ncollections, which have for years been lying untouched in the cellars\r\nof the India House. I may add that officers who have exposed their\r\nlives and impaired their health in forming similar ones at the orders\r\nand expense of the Indian government, are at home, and thrown upon\r\ntheir own resources, or the assistance of their scientific brethren,\r\nfor the means of publishing and distributing the fruits of their\r\nlabours.] The Indian government, itself, has already profited largely\r\nby these gardens, directly and indirectly, and might have done so\r\nstill more, had its efforts been better seconded either by the\r\nEuropean or native population of the country. Amongst its greatest\r\ntriumphs may be considered the introduction of the tea-plant from\r\nChina, a fact I allude to, as many of my English readers may not be\r\naware that the establishment of the tea-trade in the Himalaya and\r\nAssam is almost entirely the work of the superintendents of the\r\ngardens of Calcutta and Seharunpore.\r\n\r\nFrom no one did I receive more kindness than from Sir James Colvile,\r\nPresident of the Asiatic Society, who not only took care that I\r\nshould be provided with every comfort, but presented me with a\r\ncompletely equipped palkee, which, for strength and excellence of\r\nconstruction, was everything that a traveller could desire.\r\nOften _en route_ did I mentally thank him when I saw other\r\npalkees breaking down, and travellers bewailing the loss of those\r\nforgotten necessaries, with which his kind attention had\r\nfurnished me.\r\n\r\nI left Calcutta to join Mr. Williams' camp on the 28th of January,\r\ndriving to Hoogly on the river of that name, and thence following the\r\ngrand trunk-road westward towards Burdwan. The novelty of\r\npalkee-travelling at first renders it pleasant; the neatness with\r\nwhich every thing is packed, the good-humour of the bearers, their\r\nmerry pace, and the many more comforts enjoyed than could be expected\r\nin a conveyance _horsed by men_, the warmth when the sliding\r\ndoors are shut, and the breeze when they are open, are all fully\r\nappreciated on first starting, but soon the novelty wears off, and\r\nthe discomforts are so numerous, that it is pronounced, at best, a\r\nbarbarous conveyance. The greedy cry and gestures of the bearers,\r\nwhen, on changing, they break a fitful sleep by poking a torch in\r\nyour face, and vociferating \"Bucksheesh, Sahib;\" their discontent at\r\nthe most liberal largesse, and the sluggishness of the next set who\r\nwant bribes, put the traveller out of patience with the natives.\r\nThe dust when the slides are open, and the stifling heat when shut\r\nduring a shower, are conclusive against the vehicle, and on getting\r\nout with aching bones and giddy head at the journey's end, I shook\r\nthe dust from my person, and wished never to see a palkee again.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning I was passing through the straggling\r\nvillages close to Burdwan, consisting of native hovels by the road\r\nside, with mangos and figs planted near them, and palms waving over\r\ntheir roofs. Crossing the nearly dry bed of the Damooda, I was set\r\ndown at Mr. M'Intosh's (the magistrate of the district), and never\r\nmore thoroughly enjoyed a hearty welcome and a breakfast.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we visited the Rajah of Burdwan's palace and\r\npleasure-grounds, where I had the first glimpse of oriental\r\ngardening: the roads were generally raised, running through rice\r\nfields, now dry and hard, and bordered with trees of Jack, Bamboo,\r\n_Melia, Casuarina,_ etc. Tanks were the prominent features:\r\nchains of them, full of Indian water-lilies, being fringed with rows\r\nof the fan-palm, and occasionally the Indian date. Close to the house\r\nwas a rather good menagerie, where I saw, amongst other animals, a\r\npair of kangaroos in high health and condition, the female with young\r\nin her pouch. Before dark I was again in my palkee, and hurrying\r\nonwards. The night was cool and clear, very different from the damp\r\nand foggy atmosphere I had left at Calcutta. On the following morning\r\nI was travelling over a flat and apparently rising country, along an\r\nexcellent road, with groves of bamboos and stunted trees on either\r\nhand, few villages or palms, a sterile soil, with stunted grass and\r\nbut little cultivation; altogether a country as unlike what I had\r\nexpected to find in India as well might be. All around was a dead\r\nflat or table-land, out of which a few conical hills rose in the\r\nwest, about 1000 feet high, covered with a low forest of dusky green\r\nor yellow, from the prevalence of bamboo. The lark was singing\r\nmerrily at sunrise, and the accessories of a fresh air and dewy grass\r\nmore reminded me of some moorland in the north of England than of the\r\ntorrid regions of the east.\r\n\r\nAt 10 p.m. I arrived at Mr. Williams' camp, at Taldangah, a dawk\r\nstation near the western limit of the coal basin of the Damooda\r\nvalley. His operations being finished, he was prepared to start,\r\nhaving kindly waited a couple of days for my arrival.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the last day of January, a motley group of\r\nnatives were busy striking the tents, and loading the bullocks,\r\nbullock-carts and elephants: these proceeded on the march, occupying\r\nin straggling groups nearly three miles of road, whilst we remained\r\nto breakfast with Mr. F. Watkins, Superintendent of the East India\r\nCoal and Coke Company, who were working the seams.\r\n\r\nThe coal crops out at the surface; but the shafts worked are sunk\r\nthrough thick beds of alluvium. The age of these coal-fields is quite\r\nunknown, and I regret to say that my examination of their fossil\r\nplants throws no material light on the subject. Upwards of thirty\r\nspecies of fossil plants have been procured from them, and of these\r\nthe majority are referred by Dr. McLelland* [Reports of the\r\nGeological Survey of India. Calcutta, 1850.] to the inferior oolite\r\nepoch of England, from the prevalence of species of _Zamia,\r\nGlossopteris,_ and _Taeniopteris._ Some of these genera,\r\ntogether with _Vertebraria_ (a very remarkable Indian fossil),\r\nare also recognised in the coal-fields of Sind and of Australia.\r\nI cannot, however, think that botanical evidence of such a nature is\r\nsufficient to warrant a satisfactory reference of these Indian\r\ncoal-fields to the same epoch as those of England or of Australia; in\r\nthe first place the outlines of the fronds of ferns and their\r\nnervation are frail characters if employed alone for the\r\ndetermination of existing genera, and much more so of fossil\r\nfragments: in the second place recent ferns are so widely\r\ndistributed, that an inspection of the majority affords little clue\r\nto the region or locality they come from: and in the third place,\r\nconsidering the wide difference in latitude and longitude of\r\nYorkshire, India, and Australia, the natural conclusion is that they\r\ncould not have supported a similar vegetation at the same epoch.\r\nIn fact, finding similar fossil plants at places widely different in\r\nlatitude, and hence in climate, is, in the present state of our\r\nknowledge, rather an argument against than for their having existed\r\ncotemporaneously. The _Cycadeae,_ especially, whose fossil\r\nremains afford so much ground for geological speculations, are far\r\nfrom yielding such precise data as is supposed. Species of the order\r\nare found in Mexico, South Africa, Australia, and India, some\r\ninhabiting the hottest and dampest, and others the driest climates on\r\nthe surface of the globe; and it appears to me rash to argue much\r\nfrom the presence of the order in the coal of Yorkshire and India,\r\nwhen we reflect that the geologist of some future epoch may find as\r\ngood reasons for referring the present Cape, Australian, or Mexican\r\nFlora to the same period as that of the Lias and Oolites, when the\r\n_Cycadeae_ now living in the former countries shall\r\nbe fossilised.\r\n\r\nSpecific identity of their contained fossils may be considered as\r\nfair evidence of the cotemporaneous origin of beds, but amongst the\r\nmany collections of fossil plants that I have examined, there is\r\nhardly a specimen, belonging to any epoch, sufficiently perfect to\r\nwarrant the assumption that the species to which it belonged can be\r\nagain recognised. The botanical evidences which geologists too often\r\naccept as proofs of specific identity are such as no botanist would\r\nattach any importance to in the investigation of existing plants.\r\nThe faintest traces assumed to be of vegetable origin are habitually\r\nmade into genera and species by naturalists ignorant of the\r\nstructure, affinities and distribution of living plants, and of such\r\nmaterials the bulk of so-called systems of fossil plants is composed.\r\n\r\nA number of women were here employed in making gunpowder, grinding\r\nthe usual materials on a stone, with the addition of water from the\r\nHookah; a custom for which they have an obstinate prejudice.\r\nThe charcoal here used is made from an _Acacia_: the Seiks, I\r\nbelieve, employ _Justicia Adhatoda,_ which is also in use all\r\nover India: at Aden the Arabs prefer the _Calotropis_, probably\r\nbecause it is most easily procured. The grain of all these plants is\r\nopen, whereas in England, closer-grained and more woody trees,\r\nespecially willows, are preferred.\r\n\r\nThe jungle I found to consist chiefly of thorny bushes, Jujube of two\r\nspecies, an _Acacia_ and _Butea frondosa,_ the twigs of the\r\nlatter often covered with lurid red tears of Lac, which is here\r\ncollected in abundance. As it occurs on the plants and is collected\r\nby the natives it is called Stick-lac, but after preparation\r\nShell-lac. In Mirzapore, a species of _Celtis_ yields it, and\r\nthe Peepul very commonly in various parts of India. The elaboration\r\nof this dye, whether by the same species of insect, or by many from\r\nplants so widely different in habit and characters, is a very curious\r\nfact; since none have red juice, but some have milky and\r\nothers limpid.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, Mr. Williams and I started on an elephant, following\r\nthe camp to Gyra, twelve miles distant. The docility of these animals\r\nis an old story, but it loses so much in the telling, that their\r\ngentleness, obedience, and sagacity seemed as strange to me as if I\r\nhad never heard or read of these attributes. The swinging motion,\r\nunder a hot sun, is very oppressive, but compensated for by being so\r\nhigh above the dust. The Mahout, or driver, guides by poking his\r\ngreat toes under either ear, enforcing obedience with an iron goad,\r\nwith which he hammers the animal's head with quite as much force as\r\nwould break a cocoa-nut, or drives it through his thick skin down to\r\nthe quick. A most disagreeable sight it is, to see the blood and\r\nyellow fat oozing out in the broiling sun from these great punctures!\r\nOur elephant was an excellent one, when he did not take obstinate\r\nfits, and so docile as to pick up pieces of stone when desired, and\r\nwith a jerk of the trunk throw them over his head for the rider to\r\ncatch, thus saving the trouble of dismounting to geologise!\r\n\r\nOf sights on the road, unfrequented though this noble line is, there\r\nwere plenty for a stranger; chiefly pilgrims to Juggernath, most on\r\nfoot, and a few in carts or pony gigs of rude construction.\r\nThe vehicles from the upper country are distinguished by a far\r\nsuperior build, their horses are caparisoned with jingling bells, and\r\nthe wheels and other parts are bound with brass. The kindness of the\r\npeople towards animals, and in some cases towards their suffering\r\nrelations, is very remarkable, and may in part have given origin to\r\nthe prevalent idea that they are less cruel and stern than the\r\nmajority of mankind; but that the \"mild\" Hindoo, however gentle on\r\noccasion, is cruel and vindictive to his brother man and to animals,\r\nwhen his indolent temper is roused or his avarice stimulated, no one\r\ncan doubt who reads the accounts of Thuggee, Dacoitee, and poisoning,\r\nand witnesses the cruelty with which beasts of burthen are treated.\r\nA child carrying a bird, kid, or lamb, is not an uncommon sight, and\r\na woman with a dog in her arms is still more frequently seen.\r\nOccasionally too, a group will bear an old man to see Juggernath\r\nbefore he dies, or a poor creature with elephantiasis, who hopes to\r\nbe allowed to hurry himself to his paradise, in preference to\r\nlingering in helpless inactivity, and at last crawling up to the\r\nsecond heaven only. The costumes are as various as the religious\r\ncastes, and the many countries to which the travellers belong.\r\nNext in wealth to the merchants, the most thriving-looking wanderer\r\nis the bearer of Ganges' holy water, who drives a profitable trade,\r\nhis gains increasing as his load lightens, for the further he wanders\r\nfrom the sacred stream, the more he gets for the contents of his jar.\r\n\r\nOf merchandise we passed very little, the Ganges being still the high\r\nroad between north-west India and Bengal. Occasionally a string of\r\ncamels was seen, but, owing to the damp climate, these are rare, and\r\nunknown east of the meridian of Calcutta. A little cotton, clumsily\r\npacked in ragged bags, dirty, and deteriorating every day, even at\r\nthis dry season, proves in how bad a state it must arrive at the\r\nmarket during the rains, when the low wagons are dragged through\r\nthe streams.\r\n\r\nThe roads here are all mended with a curious stone, called Kunker,\r\nwhich is a nodular concretionary deposit of limestone, abundantly\r\nimbedded in the alluvial soil of a great part of India.* [Often\r\noccurring in strata, like flints.] It resembles a coarse gravel, each\r\npebble being often as large as a walnut, and tuberculated on the\r\nsurface: it binds admirably, and forms excellent roads, but\r\npulverises into a most disagreeable impalpable dust.\r\n\r\nA few miles beyond Taldangah we passed from the sandstone, in which\r\nthe coal lies, to a very barren country of gneiss and granite rocks,\r\nupon which the former rests; the country still rising, more hills\r\nappear, and towering far above all is Paras-nath, the culminant\r\npoint, and a mountain whose botany I was most anxious to explore.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of this part of the country is very poor, no\r\ngood-sized trees are to be seen, all is a low stunted jungle.\r\nThe grasses were few, and dried up, except in the beds of the\r\nrivulets. On the low jungly hills the same plants appear, with a few\r\nfigs, bamboo in great abundance, several handsome _Acanthaceae_; a\r\nfew _Asclepiadeae_ climbing up the bushes; and the Cowage plant, now\r\nwith over-ripe pods, by shaking which, in passing, there often falls\r\nsuch a shower of its irritating microscopic hairs, as to make the\r\nskin tingle for an hour.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of February, we moved on to Gyra, another insignificant\r\nvillage. The air was cool, and the atmosphere clear. The temperature,\r\nat three in the morning, was 65 degrees, with no dew, the grass only\r\n61 degrees°. As the sun rose, Parasnath appeared against the clear\r\ngrey sky, in the form of a beautiful broad cone, with a rugged peak,\r\nof a deeper grey than the sky. It is a remarkably handsome mountain,\r\nsufficiently lofty to be imposing, rising out of an elevated country,\r\nthe slope of which, upward to the base of the mountain, though\r\nimperceptible, is really considerable; and it is surrounded by lesser\r\nhills of just sufficient elevation to set it off. The atmosphere,\r\ntoo, of these regions is peculiarly favourable for views: it is very\r\ndry at this season; but still the hills are clearly defined, without\r\nthe harsh outlines so characteristic of a moist air. The skies are\r\nbright, the sun powerful; and there is an almost imperceptible haze\r\nthat seems to soften the landscape, and keep every object in\r\ntrue perspective.\r\n\r\nOur route led towards the picturesque hills and values in front.\r\nThe rocks were all hornblende and micaceous schist, cut through by\r\ntrap-dykes, while great crumbling masses (or bosses) of quartz\r\nprotruded through the soil. The stratified rocks were often exposed,\r\npitched up at various inclinations: they were frequently white with\r\neffloresced salts, which entering largely into the composition tended\r\nto hasten their decomposition, and being obnoxious to vegetation,\r\nrendered the sterile soil more hungry still. There was little\r\ncultivation, and that little of the most wretched kind; even\r\nrice-fields were few and scattered; there was no corn, or gram\r\n(_Ervum Lens_), no Castor-oil, no Poppy, Cotton, Safflower, or other\r\ncrops of the richer soils that flank the Ganges and Hoogly; a very\r\nlittle Sugar-cane, Dhal (_Cajana_), Mustard, Linseed, and Rape, the\r\nlatter three cultivated for their oil. Hardly a Palm was to be seen;\r\nand it was seldom that the cottages could boast of a Banana,\r\nTamarind, Orange, Cocoa-nut or Date. The Mahowa (_Bassia latifolia_)\r\nand Mango were the commonest trees. There being no Kunker in the soil\r\nhere, the roads were mended with angular quartz, much to the\r\nelephants' annoyance.\r\n\r\nWe dismounted where some very micaceous stratified rock cropped out,\r\npowdered with a saline efflorescence.* [An impure carbonate of soda.\r\nThis earth is thrown into clay vessels with water, which after\r\ndissolving the soda, is allowed to evaporate, when the remainder is\r\ncollected, and found to contain so much silica, as to be capable of\r\nbeing fused into glass. Dr. Boyle mentions this curious fact (Essay\r\non the Arts and Manufactures of India, read before the Society of\r\nArts, February 18, 1852), in illustration of the probably early epoch\r\nat which the natives of British India were acquainted with the art of\r\nmaking glass. More complicated processes are employed, and have been\r\nfrom a very early period, in other parts of the continent.] Jujubes\r\n(_Zizyphus_) prevailed, with the _Carissa carandas_ (in fruit), a\r\nshrub belonging to the usually poisonous family of Dog-banes\r\n(_Apocyneae_); its berries make good tarts, and the plant itself\r\nforms tolerable hedges.\r\n\r\nThe country around Fitcoree is rather pretty, the hills covered with\r\nbamboo and brushwood, and as usual, rising rather suddenly from the\r\nelevated plains. The jungle affords shelter to a few bears and\r\ntigers, jackals in abundance, and occasionally foxes; the birds seen\r\nare chiefly pigeons. Insects are very scarce; those of the locust\r\ntribe being most prevalent, indicative of a dry climate.\r\n\r\nThe temperature at 3 a.m.. was 65 degrees; at 3 p.m. 82 degrees; and\r\nat 10 p.m., 68 degrees, from which there was no great variation\r\nduring the whole time we spent at these elevations. The clouds were\r\nrare, and always light and high, except a little fleecy spot of\r\nvapour condensed close to the summit of Paras-nath. Though the nights\r\nwere clear and starlight, no dew was deposited, owing to the great\r\ndryness of the air. On one occasion, this drought was so great during\r\nthe passage of a hot wind, that at night I observed the wet-bulb\r\nthermometer to stand 20.5 degrees below the temperature of the air,\r\nwhich was 66 degrees; this indicated a dew-point of 11.5 degrees, or\r\n54.5 degrees below the air, and a saturation-point of 0.146; there\r\nbeing only 0.102 grains of vapour per cubic foot of air, which latter\r\nwas loaded with dust. The little moisture suspended in the atmosphere\r\nis often seen to be condensed in a thin belt of vapour, at a\r\nconsiderable distance above the dry surface of the earth, thus\r\nintercepting the radiation of heat from the latter to the clear sky\r\nabove. Such strata may be observed, crossing the hills in ribbonlike\r\nmasses, though not so clearly on this elevated region as on the\r\nplains bounding the lower course of the Soane, where the vapour is\r\nmore dense, the hills more scattered, and the whole atmosphere more\r\nhumid. During the ten days I spent amongst the hills I saw but one\r\ncloudy sunrise, whereas below, whether at Calcutta, or on the banks\r\nof the Soane, the sun always rose behind a dense fog-bank.\r\n\r\nAt 9.30 a.m. the black-bulb thermometer rose in the sun to 130\r\ndegrees. The morning observation before 10 or 11 a..m. always gives a\r\nhigher result than at noon, though the sun's declination is so\r\nconsiderably less, and in the hottest part of the day it is lower\r\nstill (3.30 p.m. 109 degrees), an effect no doubt due to the vapours\r\nraised by the sun, and which equally interfere with the photometer\r\nobservations. The N.W. winds invariably rise at about 9 a.m. and blow\r\nwith increasing strength till sunset; they are due to the rarefaction\r\nof the air over the heated ground, and being loaded with dust, the\r\ntemperature of the atmosphere is hence raised by the heated\r\nparticles. The increased temperature of the afternoon is therefore\r\nnot so much due to the accumulation of caloric from the sun's rays,\r\nas to the passage of a heated current of air derived from the much\r\nhotter regions to the westward. It would be interesting to know how\r\nfar this N.W. diurnal tide extends; also the rate at which it gathers\r\nmoisture in its progress over the damp regions of the Sunderbunds.\r\nIts excessive dryness in N.W. India approaches that of the African\r\nand Australian deserts; and I shall give an abstract of my own\r\nobservations, both in the vallies of the Soane and Ganges, and on the\r\nelevated plateaus of Behar and of Mirzapore.* [See Appendix A.]\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of February we proceeded to Tofe-Choney, the hills\r\nincreasing in height to nearly 1000 feet, and the country becoming\r\nmore picturesque. We passed some tanks covered with _Villarsia_, and\r\nfrequented by flocks of white egrets. The existence of artificial\r\ntanks so near a lofty mountain, from whose sides innumerable\r\nwater-courses descend, indicates the great natural dryness of the\r\ncountry during one season of the year. The hills and vallies were\r\nricher than I expected, though far from luxuriant. A fine _Nauclea_\r\nis a common shady tree, and _Bignonia indica_, now leafless, but with\r\nimmense pods hanging from the branches. _Acanthaceae_ is the\r\nprevalent natural order, consisting of gay-flowered _Eranthemums,\r\nRuellias, Barlerias,_ and such hothouse favourites.* [Other plants\r\ngathered here, and very typical of the Flora of this dry region, were\r\n_Linum trigynum, Feronia elephantum, Aegle marmelos, Helicteres\r\nAsoca, Abrus precatorius, Flemingia_; various _Desmodia, Rhynchosiae,\r\nGlycine,_ and _Grislea tomentosa_ very abundant, _Conocarpus\r\nlatifoliusa, Loranthus longiflorus,_ and another species;\r\n_Phyllanthus Emblica,_ various _Convolvuli, Cuscuta,_ and several\r\nherbaceous _Compositae._]\r\n\r\nThis being the most convenient station whence to ascend Paras-nath,\r\nwe started at 6 a.m. for the village of Maddaobund, at the north base\r\nof the mountain, or opposite side from that on which the grand\r\ntrunk-road runs. After following the latter for a few miles to the\r\nwest, we took a path through beautifully wooded plains, with\r\nscattered trees of the Mahowa (_Bassia latifolia_), resembling\r\ngood oaks: the natives distil a kind of arrack from its fleshy\r\nflowers, which are also eaten raw. The seeds, too, yield a concrete\r\noil, by expression, which is used for lamps and occasionally\r\nfor frying.\r\n\r\nSome villages at the west base of the mountain occupy a better soil,\r\nand are surrounded with richer cultivation; palms, mangos, and the\r\ntamarind, the first and last rare features in this part of Bengal,\r\nappeared to be common, with fields of rice and broad acres of flax\r\nand rape, through the latter of which the blue _Orobanche indica_\r\nswarmed. The short route to Maddaobund, through narrow rocky vallies,\r\nwas impracticable for the elephants, and we had to make a very\r\nconsiderable detour, only reaching that village at 2 p.m. All the\r\nhill people we observed were a fine-looking athletic race; they\r\ndisclaimed the tiger being a neighbour, which every palkee-bearer\r\nalong the road declares to carry off the torch-bearers, torch and\r\nall. Bears they said were scarce, and all other wild animals, but a\r\nnatural jealousy of Europeans often leads the natives to deny the\r\nexistence of what they know to be an attraction to the proverbially\r\nsporting Englishman.\r\n\r\nIllustration - OLD TAMARIND TREES.\r\n\r\nThe site of Maddaobund, elevated 1230 feet, in a clearance of the\r\nforest, and the appearance of the snow-white domes and bannerets of\r\nits temples through the fine trees by which it is surrounded, are\r\nvery beautiful. Though several hundred feet above any point we had\r\nhitherto reached, the situation is so sheltered that the tamarind,\r\npeepul, and banyan trees are superb. A fine specimen of the latter\r\nstands at the entrance to the village, not a broadheaded tree, as is\r\nusual in the prime of its existence, but a mass of trunks irregularly\r\nthrowing out immense branches in a most picturesque manner; the\r\noriginal trunk is apparently gone, and the principal mass of root\r\nstems is fenced in. This, with two magnificent tamarinds, forms a\r\ngrand clump. The ascent of the mountain is immediately from the\r\nvillage up a pathway worn by the feet of many a pilgrim from the most\r\nremote parts of India.\r\n\r\nParas-nath is a mountain of peculiar sanctity, to which circumstance\r\nis to be attributed the flourishing state of Maddaobund. The name is\r\nthat of the twenty-third incarnation of Jinna (Sanscrit \"Conqueror\"),\r\nwho was born at Benares, lived one hundred years, and was buried on\r\nthis mountain, which is the eastern metropolis of Jain worship, as\r\nMount Aboo is the western (where are their libraries and most\r\nsplendid temples). The origin of the Jain sect is obscure, though its\r\nrise appears to correspond with the wreck of Boodhism throughout\r\nIndia in the eleventh century. The Jains form in some sort a\r\ntransition-sect between Boodhists and Hindoos, differing from the\r\nformer in acknowledging castes, and from both in their worship of\r\nParas-nath's foot, instead of that of Munja-gosha of the Boodhs, or\r\nVishnoo's of the Hindoos. As a sect of Boodhists their religion is\r\nconsidered pure, and free from the obscenities so conspicuous in\r\nHindoo worship; whilst, in fact, perhaps the reverse is the case;\r\nbut the symbols are fewer, and indeed almost confined to the feet of\r\nParas-nath, and the priests jealously conceal their esoteric\r\ndoctrines.\r\n\r\nThe temples, though small, are well built, and carefully kept.\r\nNo persuasion could induce the Brahmins to allow us to proceed beyond\r\nthe vestibule without taking off our shoes, to which we were not\r\ninclined to consent. The bazaar was for so small a village large, and\r\ncrowded to excess with natives of all castes, colours, and provinces\r\nof India, very many from the extreme W. and N.W., Rajpootana, the\r\nMadras Presidency, and Central India. Numbers had come in good cars,\r\nwell attended, and appeared men of wealth and consequence; while the\r\nquantities of conveyances of all sorts standing about, rather\r\nreminded me of an election, than of anything I had seen in India.\r\n\r\nThe natives of the place were a more Negro-looking race than the\r\nBengalees to whom I had previously been accustomed; and the curiosity\r\nand astonishment they displayed at seeing (probably many of them for\r\nthe first time) a party of Englishmen, were sufficiently amusing.\r\nOur coolies with provisions not having come up, and it being two\r\no'clock in the afternoon, I having had no breakfast, and being\r\nignorant of the exclusively Jain population of the village, sent my\r\nservant to the bazaar, for some fowls and eggs; but he was mobbed for\r\nasking for these articles, and parched rice, beaten flat, with some\r\ncoarse sugar, was all I could obtain; together with sweetmeats so\r\nodiously flavoured with various herbs, and sullied with such\r\nimpurities, that we quickly made them over to the elephants.\r\n\r\nNot being able to ascend the mountain and return in one day,\r\nMr. Williams and his party went back to the road, leaving Mr. Haddon\r\nand myself, who took up our quarters under a tamarind-tree.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a very gaudy poojah was performed. The car, filled\r\nwith idols, was covered with gilding and silk, and drawn by noble\r\nbulls, festooned and garlanded. A procession was formed in front; and\r\nit opened into an avenue, up and down which gaily dressed\r\ndancing-boys paced or danced, shaking castanets, the attendant\r\nworshippers singing in discordant voices, beating tom-toms, cymbals,\r\netc. Images (of Boodh apparently) abounded on the car, in front of\r\nwhich a child was placed. The throng of natives was very great and\r\nperfectly orderly, indeed, sufficiently apathetic: they were\r\nremarkably civil in explaining what they understood of their\r\nown worship.\r\n\r\nAt 2 p.m., the thermometer was only 65 degrees, though the day was\r\nfine, a strong haze obstructing the sun's rays; at 6 p.m., 58\r\ndegrees; at 9 p.m., 56 degrees, and the grass cooled to 49 degrees.\r\nStill there was no dew, though the night was starlight.\r\n\r\nHaving provided doolies, or little bamboo chairs slung on four men's\r\nshoulders, in which I put my papers and boxes, we next morning\r\ncommenced the ascent; at first through woods of the common trees,\r\nwith large clumps of bamboo, over slaty rocks of gneiss, much\r\ninclined and sloping away from the mountain. The view from a ridge\r\n500 feet high was superb, of the village, and its white domes half\r\nburied in the forest below, the latter of which continued in sight\r\nfor many miles to the northward. Descending to a valley some ferns\r\nwere met with, and a more luxuriant vegetation, especially of\r\n_Urticeae._ Wild bananas formed a beautiful, and to me novel\r\nfeature in the woods.\r\n\r\nThe conical hills of the white ants were very abundant. The structure\r\nappears to me not an independent one, but the debris of clumps of\r\nbamboos, or of the trunks of large trees, which these insects have\r\ndestroyed. As they work up a tree from the ground, they coat the bark\r\nwith particles of sand glued together, carrying up this artificial\r\nsheath or covered way as they ascend. A clump of bamboos is thus\r\nspeedily killed; when the dead stems fall away, leaving the mass of\r\nstumps coated with sand, which the action of the weather soon\r\nfashions into a cone of earthy matter.\r\n\r\nAscending again, the path strikes up the hill, through a thick forest\r\nof Sal (_Vateria robusta_) and other trees, spanned with cables\r\nof scandent _Bauhinia_ stems. At about 3000 feet above the sea,\r\nthe vegetation becomes more luxuriant, and by a little stream I\r\ncollected five species of ferns and some mosses,--all in a dry state,\r\nhowever. Still higher, _Clematis, Thalictrum,_ and an increased\r\nnumber of grasses are seen; with bushes of _Verbenaceae_ and\r\n_Compositae._ The white ant apparently does not enter this\r\ncooler region. At 3500 feet the vegetation again changes, the trees\r\nall become gnarled and scattered; and as the dampness also increases,\r\nmore mosses and ferns appear. We emerged from the forest at the foot\r\nof the great ridge of rocky peaks, stretching E. and W. three or four\r\nmiles. Abundance of a species of berberry and an _Osbeckia_\r\nmarked the change in the vegetation most decidedly, and were frequent\r\nover the whole summit, with coarse grasses, and various bushes.\r\n\r\nAt noon we reached the saddle of the crest (alt. 4230 feet), where\r\nwas a small temple, one of five or six which occupy various\r\nprominences of the ridge. The wind, N.W., was cold, the temp. 56\r\ndegrees. The view was beautiful, but the atmosphere too hazy: to the\r\nnorth were ranges of low wooded hills, and the course of the Barakah\r\nand Adji rivers; to the south lay a flatter country, with lower\r\nranges, and the Damooda river, its all but waterless bed snowy-white\r\nfrom the exposed granite blocks with which its course is strewn.\r\nEast and west the several sharp ridges of the mountain itself are\r\nseen; the western considerably the highest. Immediately below, the\r\nmountain flanks appear clothed with impenetrable forest, here and\r\nthere interrupted by rocky eminences; while to the north the grand\r\ntrunk road shoots across the plains, like a white thread, as straight\r\nas an arrow, spanning here and there the beds of the mountain\r\ntorrents.\r\n\r\nOn the south side the vegetation was more luxuriant than on the\r\nnorth, though, from the heat of the sun, the reverse might have been\r\nexpected. This is owing partly to the curve taken by the ridge being\r\nopen to the south, and partly to the winds from that quarter being\r\nthe moist ones. Accordingly, trees which I had left 3000 feet below\r\nin the north ascent, here ascended to near the summit, such as figs\r\nand bananas. A short-stemmed palm (_Phoenix_) was tolerably\r\nabundant, and a small tree (_Pterospermum_) on which a species\r\nof grass grew epiphytically; forming a curious feature in the\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the principal temple is very fine, below the saddle\r\nin a hollow facing the south, surrounded by jungles of plantain and\r\nbanyan. It is small, and contains little worthy of notice but the\r\nsculptured feet of Paras-nath, and some marble Boodh idols;\r\ncross-legged figures with crisp hair and the Brahminical cord.\r\nThese, a leper covered with ashes in the vestibule, and an\r\nofficiating priest, were all we saw. Pilgrims were seen on various\r\nparts of the mountain in very considerable numbers, passing from one\r\ntemple to another, and generally leaving a few grains of dry rice at\r\neach; the rich and lame were carried in chairs, the poorer walked.\r\n\r\nThe culminant rocks are very dry, but in the rains may possess many\r\ncurious plants; a fine _Kalanchoe_ was common, with the berberry, a\r\nbeautiful _Indigofera,_ and various other shrubs; a _Bolbophyllum_\r\ngrew on the rocks, with a small _Begonia,_ and some ferns. There were\r\nno birds, and very few insects, a beautiful small _Pontia_ being the\r\nonly butterfly. The striped squirrel was very busy amongst the rocks;\r\nand I saw a few mice, and the traces of bears.\r\n\r\nAt 3 p.m., the temperature was 54 degrees, and the air deliciously\r\ncool and pleasant. I tried to reach the western peak (perhaps 300\r\nfeet above the saddle), by keeping along the ridge, but was cut off\r\nby precipices, and ere I could retrace my steps it was time to\r\ndescend. This I was glad to do in a doolie, and I was carried to the\r\nbottom, with only one short rest, in an hour and three quarters.\r\nThe descent was very steep the whole way, partly down steps of sharp\r\nrock, where one of the men cut his foot severely. The pathway at the\r\nbottom was lined for nearly a quarter of a mile with sick, halt,\r\nmaimed, lame, and blind beggars, awaiting our descent. It was truly a\r\nfearful sight, especially the lepers, and numerous unhappy victims\r\nto elephantiasis.\r\n\r\nThough the botany of Paras-nath proved interesting, its elevation was\r\nnot accompanied by such a change from the flora of its base as I had\r\nexpected. This is no doubt due to its dry climate and sterile soil;\r\ncharacters which it shares with the extensive elevated area of which\r\nit forms a part, and upon which I could not detect above 300 species\r\nof plants during my journey. Yet, that the atmosphere at the summit\r\nis more damp as well as cooler than at the base, is proved as well by\r\nthe observations as by the vegetation;* [Of plants eminently typical\r\nof a moister atmosphere, I may mention the genera _Bolbophyllum,\r\nBegonia, Aeginetia, Disporum, Roxburghia, Panax, Eugenia, Myrsine,\r\nShorea, Millettia,_ ferns, mosses, and foliaceous lichens; which\r\nappeared in strange association with such dry-climate genera as\r\n_Kalanchoe, Pterospermum,_ and the dwarf-palm, _Phoenix._ Add to this\r\nlist the _Berberis asiatica, Clematis nutans, Thalictrum\r\nglyphocarpum,_ 27 grasses, _Cardamine,_ etc., and the mountain top\r\npresents a mixture of the plants of a damp hot, a dry hot, and of a\r\ntemperate climate, in fairly balanced proportions. The prime elements\r\nof a tropical flora were however wholly wanting on Paras-nath, where\r\nare neither Peppers, _Pothos, Arum,_ tall or climbing palms,\r\ntree-ferns, _Guttiferae,_ vines, or laurels.] and in some respects,\r\nas the increased proportion of ferns, additional epiphytal orchideous\r\nplants, _Begonias,_ and other species showed, its top supported a\r\nmore tropical flora than its base.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDoomree -- Vegetation of table-land -- Lieutenant Beadle -- Birds --\r\nHot springs of Soorujkoond -- Plants near them -- Shells in them --\r\nCholera-tree -- Olibanum -- Palms, form of -- Dunwah Pass -- Trees,\r\nnative and planted -- Wild peacock -- Poppy fields -- Geography and\r\ngeology of Behar and Central India -- Toddy-palm -- Ground,\r\ntemperature of -- Barroon -- Temperature of plants -- Lizard -- Cross\r\nthe Soane -- Sand, ripple marks on -- Kymore hills -- Ground,\r\ntemperature of -- Limestone -- Rotas fort and palace -- Nitrate of\r\nlime -- Change of climate -- Lime stalagmites, enclosing leaves --\r\nFall of Soane -- Spiders, etc. -- Scenery and natural history of\r\nupper Soane valley -- _Hardwickia binata_ -- Bhel fruit --\r\nDust-storm -- Alligator -- Catechu -- _Cochlospermum_ --\r\nLeaf-bellows -- Scorpions -- Tortoises -- Florican -- Limestone\r\nspheres -- Coles -- Tiger-hunt -- Robbery.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we returned to our tamarind tree, and the next morning\r\nregained the trunk road, following it to the dawk bungalow of\r\nDoomree. On the way I found the _Caesalpinia paniculuta,_ a\r\nmagnificent climber, festooning the trues with its dark glossy\r\nfoliage and gorgeous racemes of orange blossoms. Receding from the\r\nmountain, the country again became barren: at Doomree the hills were\r\nof crystalline rocks, chiefly quartz and gneiss; no palms or large\r\ntrees of any kind appeared. The spear-grass abounded, and a\r\ndetestable nuisance it was, its long awns and husked seed working\r\nthrough trowsers and stockings.\r\n\r\n_Balanites_ was not uncommon, forming a low thorny bush, with\r\n_Aegle marmelos_ and _Feronia elephantum._ Having rested\r\nthe tired elephant, we pushed on in the evening to the next stage,\r\nBaghoda, arriving there at 3 a.m., and after a few hours' rest, I\r\nwalked to the bungalow of Lieutenant Beadle, the surveyor of roads,\r\nsixteen miles further.\r\n\r\nThe country around Baghoda is still very barren, but improves\r\nconsiderably in going westward, the ground becoming hilly, and the\r\nroad winding through prettily wooded vallies, and rising gradually to\r\n1446 feet. _Nauclea cordifolia,_ a tree resembling a young\r\nsycamore, is very common; with the Semul (_Bombax_), a very\r\nstriking tree from its buttressed trunk and gaudy scarlet flowers,\r\nswarming with birds, which feed from its honeyed blossoms.\r\n\r\nAt 10 a.m. the sun became uncomfortably hot, the thermometer being\r\n77 degrees, and the black-bulb thermometer 137 degrees. I had lost my\r\nhat, and possessed no substitute but a silken nightcap; so I had to\r\ntie a handkerchief over my head, to the astonishment of the\r\npassers-by. Holding my head down, I had little source of amusement\r\nbut reading the foot-marks on the road; and these were strangely\r\ndiversified to an English eye. Those of the elephant, camel, buffalo\r\nand bullock, horse, ass, pony, dog, goat, sheep and kid, lizard,\r\nwild-cat and pigeon, with men, women, and children's feet, naked and\r\nshod, were all recognisable.\r\n\r\nIt was noon ere I arrived at Lieutenant Beadle's, at Belcuppee (alt.\r\n1219 feet), glad enough of the hearty welcome I received, being very\r\nhot, dusty, and hungry. The country about his bungalow is very\r\npretty, from the number of wooded hills and large trees, especially\r\nof banyan and peepul, noble oak-like Mahowa (_Bassia_), _Nauclea,_\r\nMango, and _Ficus infectoria._ These are all scattered, however, and\r\ndo not form forest, such as in a stunted form clothes the hills,\r\nconsisting of _Diospyros, Terminalia, Gmelina, Nauclea parvifolia,\r\nBuchanania,_ etc. The rocks are still hornblende-schist and granite,\r\nwith a covering of alluvium, full of quartz pebbles. Insects and\r\nbirds are numerous, the latter consisting of jays, crows, doves,\r\nsparrows, and maina (_Pastor_); also the _Phoenicophaus tristis_\r\n(\"Mahoka\" of the natives), with a note like that of the English\r\ncuckoo, as heard late in the season.\r\n\r\nI remained two days with Lieutenant Beadle, enjoying in his society\r\nseveral excursions to the hot springs, etc. These springs (called\r\nSoorujkoond) are situated close to the road, near the mouth of a\r\nvalley, in a remarkably pretty spot. They are, of course, objects of\r\nworship; and a ruined temple stands close behind them, with three\r\nvery conspicuous trees--a peepul, a banyan, and a white,\r\nthick-stemmed, leafless _Sterculia,_ whose branches bore dense\r\nclusters of greenish foetid flowers. The hot springs are four in\r\nnumber, and rise in as many ruined brick tanks about two yards\r\nacross. Another tank, fed by a cold spring, about twice that size,\r\nflows between two of the hot, only two or three paces distant from\r\none of the latter on either hand. All burst through the gneiss rocks,\r\nmeet in one stream after a few yards, and are conducted by bricked\r\ncanals to a pool of cold water, about eighty yards off.\r\n\r\nThe temperatures of the hot springs were respectively 169 degrees,\r\n170 degrees, 173 degrees, and 190 degrees; of the cold, 84 degrees at\r\n4 p.m., and 75 degrees at 7 a.m. the following morning. The hottest\r\nis the middle of the five. The water of the cold spring is sweet but\r\nnot good, and emits gaseous bubbles; it was covered with a green\r\nfloating _Conferva._ Of the four hot springs, the most copious\r\nis about three feet deep, bubbles constantly, boils eggs, and though\r\nbrilliantly clear, has an exceedingly nauseous taste. This and the\r\nother warm ones cover the bricks and surrounding rocks with a thick\r\nincrustation of salts.\r\n\r\n_Confervae_ abound in the warm stream from the springs, and two\r\nspecies, one ochreous brown, and the other green, occur on the\r\nmargins of the tanks themselves, and in the hottest water; the brown\r\nis the best Salamander, and forms a belt in deeper water than the\r\ngreen; both appear in broad luxuriant strata, wherever the temp. is\r\ncooled down to 168 degrees, and as low as 90 degrees. Of flowering\r\nplants, three showed in an eminent degree a constitution capable of\r\nresisting the heat, if not a predilection for it; these were all\r\n_Cyperaceae,_ a _Cyperus_ and an _Eleocharis,_ having their roots in\r\nwater of 100 degrees, and where they are probably exposed to greater\r\nheat, and a _Fimbristylis_ at 98 degrees; all were very luxuriant.\r\nFrom the edges of the four hot springs I gathered sixteen species of\r\nflowering plants, and from the cold tank five, which did not grow in\r\nthe hot. A water-beetle, _Colymbetes_(?) and _Notonecta,_ abounded in\r\nwater at 112 degrees, with quantities of dead shells; frogs were very\r\nlively, with live shells, at 90 degrees, and with various other water\r\nbeetles. Having no means of detecting the salts of this water, I\r\nbottled some for future analysis.* [For an account of the\r\n_Confervae,_ and of the mineral constituents of the waters, etc. see\r\nAppendix B.]\r\n\r\nOn the following day I botanized in the neighbourhood, with but poor\r\nsuccess. An oblique-leaved fig climbs the other trees, and generally\r\nstrangles them: two epiphytal _Orchideae_ also occur on the latter,\r\n_Vanda Roxburghii_ and an _Oberonia._ Dodders (_Cuscuta_) of two\r\nspecies, and _Cassytha,_ swarm over and conceal the bushes with their\r\nyellow thread-like stems.\r\n\r\nI left Belcuppee on the 8th of February, following Mr. Williams'\r\ncamp. The morning was clear and cold, the temperature only 56\r\ndegrees. We crossed the nearly dry broad bed of the Burkutta river, a\r\nnoble stream during the rains, carrying along huge boulders of\r\ngranite and gneiss. Near this I passed the Cholera-tree, a famous\r\npeepul by the road side, so called from a detachment of infantry\r\nhaving been attacked and decimated at the spot by that fell disease;\r\nit is covered with inscriptions and votive tokens in the shape of\r\nrags, etc. We continued to ascend to 1360 feet, where I came upon a\r\nsmall forest of the Indian Olibanum (_Boswellia thurifera_),\r\nconspicuous from its pale bark, and spreading curved branches, leafy\r\nat their tips; its general appearance is a good deal like that of the\r\nmountain ash. The gum, celebrated throughout the East, was flowing\r\nabundantly from the trunk, very fragrant and transparent. The ground\r\nwas dry, sterile, and rocky; kunker, the curious formation mentioned\r\nat Chapter 1, appears in the alluvium, which I had not elsewhere seen\r\nat this elevation.\r\n\r\nDescending to the village of Burshoot, we lost sight of the\r\n_Boswellia,_ and came upon a magnificent tope of mango, banyan,\r\nand peepul, so far superior to anything hitherto met with, that we\r\nwere glad to choose such a pleasant halting-place for breakfast.\r\nThere are a few lofty fan-palms here too, great rarities in this soil\r\nand elevation: one, about eighty feet high, towered above some\r\nwretched hovels, displaying the curious proportions of this tribe of\r\npalms: first, a short cone, tapering to one-third the height of the\r\nstem, the trunk then swelling to two-thirds, and again tapering to\r\nthe crown. Beyond this, the country again ascends to Burree (alt.\r\n1169 feet), another dawk bungalow, a barren place, which we left on\r\nthe following morning.\r\n\r\nSo little was there to observe, that I again amused myself by\r\nwatching footsteps, the precision of which in the sandy soil was\r\ncurious. Looking down from the elephant, I was interested by seeing\r\nthem all in _relief,_ instead of _depressed,_ the slanting\r\nrays of the sun in front producing this kind of mirage. Before us\r\nrose no more of those wooded hills that had been our companions for\r\nthe last 120 miles, the absence of which was a sign of the nearly\r\napproaching termination of the great hilly plateau we had been\r\ntraversing for that distance.\r\n\r\nChorparun, at the top of the Dunwah pass, is situated on an extended\r\nbarren flat, 1320 feet above the sea, and from it the descent from\r\nthe table-land to the level of the Soane valley, a little above that\r\nof the Ganges at Patna, is very sudden. The road is carried zizgag\r\ndown a rugged hill of gneiss, with a descent of nearly 1000 feet in\r\nsix miles, of which 600 are exceedingly steep. The pass is well\r\nwooded, with abundance of bamboo, _Bombax, Cassia, Acacia,_ and\r\n_Butea,_ with _Calotropis,_ the purple Mudar, a very handsome\r\nroad-side plant, which I had not seen before, but which, with the\r\n_Argemone Mexicana,_ was to be a companion for hundreds of miles\r\nfarther. All the views in the pass are very picturesque, though\r\nwanting in good foliage, such as _Ficus_ would afford, of which I did\r\nnot see one tree. Indeed the rarity of the genus (except\r\n_F. infectoria_) in the native woods of these hills, is very\r\nremarkable. The banyan and peepul always appear to be planted, as do\r\nthe tamarind and mango.\r\n\r\nDunwah, at the foot of the pass, is 620 feet above the sea, and\r\nnearly 1000 below the mean level of the highland I had been\r\ntraversing. Every thing bears here a better aspect; the woods at\r\nthe foot of the hills afforded many plants; the bamboo\r\n(_B. stricta_) is green instead of yellow and white; a little\r\ncastor-oil is cultivated, and the Indian date (low and stunted)\r\nappears about the cottages.\r\n\r\nIn the woods I heard and saw the wild peacock for the first time.\r\nIts voice is not to be distinguished from that of the tame bird in\r\nEngland, a curious instance of the perpetuation of character under\r\nwidely different circumstances, for the crow of the wild jungle-fowl\r\ndoes not rival that of the farm-yard cock.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we left Dunwah for Barah (alt. 480 feet), passing over\r\nvery barren soil, covered with low jungle, the original woods having\r\napparently been cut for fuel. Our elephant, a timid animal, came on a\r\ndrove of camels in the dark by the road-side, and in his alarm\r\ninsisted on doing battle, tearing through the thorny jungle,\r\nregardless of the mahout, and still more of me: the uproar raised by\r\nthe camel-drivers was ridiculous, and the danger to my barometer\r\nimminent.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded on the 11th of February to Sheergotty, where Mr.\r\nWilliams and his camp were awaiting our arrival. Wherever cultivation\r\nappeared the crops were tolerably luxuriant, but a great deal of the\r\ncountry yielded scarcely half-a-dozen kinds of plants to any ten\r\nsquare yards of ground. The most prevalent were _Carissa carandas,\r\nOlax scandens,_ two _Zizyphi,_ and the ever-present _Acacia\r\nCatechu._ The climate is, however, warmer and much moister, for I\r\nhere observed dew to be formed, which I afterwards found to be usual\r\non the low grounds. That its presence is due to the increased amount\r\nof vapour in the atmosphere I shall prove: the amount of radiation,\r\nas shown by the cooling of the earth and vegetation, being the same\r\nin the elevated plain and lower levels.* [See Appendix C.]\r\n\r\nThe good soil was very richly cultivated with poppy (which I had not\r\nseen before), sugar-cane, wheat, barley, mustard, rape, and flax.\r\nAt a distance a field of poppies looks like a green lake, studded\r\nwith white water-lilies. The houses, too, are better, and have tiled\r\nroofs; while, in such situations, the road is lined with trees.\r\n\r\nA retrospect of the ground passed over is unsatisfactory, as far as\r\nbotany is concerned, except as showing how potent are the effects of\r\na dry soil and climate during one season of the year upon a\r\nvegetation which has no desert types. During the rains probably many\r\nmore species would be obtained, for of annuals I scarcely found\r\ntwenty. At that season, however, the jungles of Behar and Birbhoom,\r\nthough far from tropically luxuriant, are singularly unhealthy.\r\n\r\nIn a geographical point of view the range of hills between Burdwan\r\nand the Soave is interesting, as being the north-east continuation of\r\na chain which crosses the broadest part of the peninsula of India,\r\nfrom the Gulf of Cambay to the junction of the Ganges and Hoogly at\r\nRajmahal. This range runs south of the Soane and Kymore, which it\r\nmeets I believe at Omerkuntuk;* [A lofty mountain said to be\r\n7000-8000 feet high.] the granite of this and the sandstone of the\r\nother, being there both overlaid with trap. Further west again, the\r\nranges separate, the southern still betraying a nucleus of granite,\r\nforming the Satpur range, which divides the valley of the Taptee from\r\nthat of the Nerbudda. The Paras-nath range is, though the most\r\ndifficult of definition, the longer of the two parallel ranges;\r\nthe Vindhya continued as the Kymore, terminating abruptly at the Fort\r\nof Chunar on the Ganges. The general and geological features of the\r\ntwo, especially along their eastern course, are very different.\r\nThis consists of metamorphic gneiss, in various highly inclined beds,\r\nthrough which granite hills protrude, the loftiest of which is\r\nParas-nath. The north-east Vindhya (called Kymore), on the other\r\nhand, consists of nearly horizontal beds of sandstone, overlying\r\ninclined beds of non-fossiliferous limestone. Between the latter and\r\nthe Paras-nath gneiss, come (in order of superposition) shivered and\r\nundulating strata of metamorphic quartz, hornstone, hornstone-\r\nporphyry, jaspers, etc. These are thrown up, by greenstone I believe,\r\nalong the north and north-west boundary of the gneiss range, and are\r\nto be recognised as forming the rocks of Colgong, of Sultangunj, and\r\nof Monghyr, on the Ganges, as also various detached hills near Gyah,\r\nand along the upper course of the Soane. From these are derived the\r\nbeautiful agates and cornelians, so famous under the name of Soane\r\npebbles, and they are equally common on the Curruckpore range, as on\r\nthe south bank of the Soane, so much so in the former position as to\r\nhave been used in the decoration of the walls of the now ruined\r\npalaces near Bhagulpore.\r\n\r\nIn the route I had taken, I had crossed the eastern extremity alone\r\nof the range, commencing with a very gradual ascent, over the\r\nalluvial plains of the west bank of the Hoogly, then over laterite,\r\nsucceeded by sandstone of the Indian coal era, which is succeeded by\r\nthe granite table-land, properly so called. A little beyond the coal\r\nfields, the table-land reaches an average height of 1130 feet, which\r\nis continued for upwards of 100 miles, to the Dunwah pass. Here the\r\ndescent is sudden to plains, which, continuous with those of the\r\nGanges, run up the Soane till beyond Rotasghur. Except for the\r\noccasional ridges of metamorphic rocks mentioned above, and some\r\nhills of intruded greenstone, the lower plain is stoneless, its\r\nsubjacent rocks being covered with a thicker stratum of the same\r\nalluvium which is thinly spread over the higher table-land above.\r\nThis range is of great interest from its being the source of many\r\nimportant rivers,* [The chief rivers from this, the great watershed\r\nof western Bengal, flow north-west and south-east; a few\r\ncomparatively insignificant streams running north to the Ganges.\r\nAmongst the former are the Rheru, the Kunner, and the Coyle, which\r\ncontribute to the Soane; amongst the latter, the Dammooda, Adji, and\r\nBarakah, flow into the Hoogly, and the Subunrika, Braminee, and\r\nMahanuddee into the Bay of Bengal.] and of all those which water the\r\ncountry between the Soane, Hoogly, and Ganges, as well as from its\r\ndeflecting the course of the latter river, which washes its base at\r\nRajmahal, and forcing it to take a sinuous course to the sea. In its\r\nclimate and botany it differs equally from the Gangetic plains to the\r\nnorth, and from the hot, damp, and exuberant forests of Orissa to the\r\nsouth. Nor are its geological features less different, or its\r\nconcomitant and in part resultant characters of agriculture and\r\nnative population. Still further west, the great rivers of the\r\npeninsula have their origin, the Nerbudda and Taptee flowing west to\r\nthe gulf of Cambay, the Cane to the Jumna, the Soane to the Ganges,\r\nand the northern feeders of the Godavery to the Bay of Bengal.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of February, we left Sheergotty (alt. 463 feet), crossing\r\nsome small streams, which, like all else seen since leaving the\r\nDunwah Pass, flow N. to the Ganges. Between Sheergotty and the Soane,\r\noccur many of the isolated hills of greenstone, mentioned above,\r\nbetter known to the traveller from having been telegraphic stations.\r\nSome are much impregnated with iron, and whether for their colour,\r\nthe curious outlines of many, or their position, form quaint, and in\r\nsome cases picturesque features in the otherwise tame landscape.\r\n\r\nThe road being highly cultivated, and the Date-palm becoming more\r\nabundant, we encamped in a grove of these trees. All were curiously\r\ndistorted; the trunks growing zigzag, from the practice of yearly\r\ntapping the alternate sides for toddy. The incision is just below the\r\ncrown, and slopes upwards and inwards: a vessel is hung below the\r\nwound, and the juice conducted into it by a little piece of bamboo.\r\nThis operation spoils the fruit, which, though eaten, is small, and\r\nmuch inferior to the African date.\r\n\r\nAt Mudunpore (alt. 440 feet) a thermometer, sunk 3 feet 4 inches in\r\nthe soil, maintained a constant temperature of 71.5 degrees, that of\r\nthe air varying from 77.5 degrees, at 3 p.m., to 62 at daylight the\r\nfollowing morning; when we moved on to Nourunga (alt. 340 feet),\r\nwhere I bored to 3 feet 8 inches with a heavy iron jumper through an\r\nalluvium of such excessive tenacity, that eight natives were employed\r\nfor four hours in the operation. In both this and another hole,\r\n4 feet 8 inches, the temperature was 72 degrees at 10 p.m.; and on\r\nthe following morning 71.5 degrees in the deepest hole, and\r\n70 degrees in the shallower: that of the external air varied from\r\n71 degrees at 3 p.m., to 57 degrees at daylight on the following\r\nmorning. At the latter time I took the temperature of the earth near\r\nthe surface, which showed, surface 53 degrees, 1 inch 57 degrees,\r\n2 inches 58 degrees, 4 inches 62 degrees, 7 inches 64 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe following day we marched to Baroon (alt. 345 feet) on the\r\nalluvial banks of the Soane, crossing a deep stream by a pretty\r\nsuspension bridge, of which the piers were visible two miles off, so\r\nlevel is the road. The Soane is here three miles wide, its nearly dry\r\nbed being a desert of sand, resembling a vast arm of the sea when the\r\ntide is out: the banks are very barren, with no trees near, and but\r\nvery few in the distance. The houses were scarcely visible on the\r\nopposite side, behind which the Kymore mountains rise. The Soane is a\r\nclassical river, being now satisfactorily identified with the\r\nEranoboas of the ancients.* [The etymology of Eranoboas is\r\nundoubtedly _Hierrinia Vahu_ (Sanskrit), the golden-armed.\r\nSons is also the Sanskrit for gold. The stream is celebrated for its\r\nagates (Soane pebbles), which are common, but gold is not now\r\nobtained from it.]\r\n\r\nThe alluvium is here cut into a cliff, ten or twelve feet above the\r\nbed of the river, and against it the sand is blown in naked\r\n_dunes._ At 2 p.m., the surface-sand was heated to 110 degrees\r\nwhere sheltered from the wind, and 104 degrees in the open bed of the\r\nriver. To compare the rapidity and depth to which the heat is\r\ncommunicated by pure sand, and by the tough alluvium, I took the\r\ntemperature at some inches depth in both. That the alluvium absorbs\r\nthe heat better, and retains it longer, would appear from the\r\nfollowing, the only observations I could make, owing to the tenacity\r\nof the soil.\r\n\r\n2 p.m.\r\nSurface           104 degrees\r\n22.5 inches        93 degrees\r\n5 inches           88 degrees\r\nSand at this depth 78 degrees.\r\n5 a.m.\r\nSurface            51 degrees\r\n28 inches          68 degrees\r\n\r\nFinding the fresh milky juice of _Calotropis_ to be only\r\n72 degrees, I was curious to ascertain at what depth this\r\ntemperature was to be obtained in the sand of the river-bed, where\r\nthe plant grew.\r\n\r\nSurface    104.5 degrees,\r\n1 inch     102 degrees,\r\n2 inches    94 degrees,\r\n2.5 inches  90 degrees,\r\n3.5 inches  85 degrees (Compact),\r\n8 inches    73 degrees (Wet),\r\n15 inches   72 degrees (Wet).\r\n\r\nThe power this plant exercises of maintaining a low temperature of 72\r\ndegrees, though the main portion which is subterraneous is surrounded\r\nby a soil heated to between 90 degrees and 104 degrees, is very\r\nremarkable, and no doubt proximately due to the rapidity of\r\nevaporation from the foliage, and consequent activity in the\r\ncirculation. Its exposed leaves maintained a temperature of 80\r\ndegrees, nearly 25 degrees cooler than the similarly exposed sand and\r\nalluvium. On the same night the leaves were cooled down to 54\r\ndegrees, when the sand had cooled to 51 degrees. Before daylight the\r\nfollowing morning the sand had cooled to 43 degrees, and the leaves\r\nof the _Calotropis_ to 45.5 degrees. I omitted to observe the\r\ntemperature of the sap at the latter time; but the sand at the same\r\ndepth (15 inches) as that at which its temperature and that of the\r\nplant agreed at mid-day, was 68 degrees. And assuming this to be the\r\nheat of the plant, we find that the leaves are heated by solar\r\nradiation during the day 8 degrees, and cooled by nocturnal\r\nradiation, 22.5 degrees.\r\n\r\nMr. Theobald (my companion in this and many other rambles) pulled a\r\nlizard from a hole in the bank. Its throat was mottled with scales of\r\nbrown and yellow. Three ticks had fastened on it, each of a size\r\ncovering three or four scales: the first was yellow, corresponding\r\nwith the yellow colour of the animal's belly, where it lodged, the\r\nsecond brown, from the lizard's head; but the third, which was\r\nclinging to the parti-coloured scales of the neck, had its body\r\nparti-coloured, the hues corresponding with the individual scales\r\nwhich they covered. The adaptation of the two first specimens in\r\ncolour to the parts to which they adhered, is sufficiently\r\nremarkable; but the third case was most extraordinary.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 14th of February, I observed a beautiful\r\ndisplay, apparently of the Aurora borealis, an account of which will\r\nbe found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n_February_ 15.--Our passage through the Soane sands was very\r\ntedious, though accomplished in excellent style, the elephants\r\npushing forward the heavy waggons of mining tools with their\r\nforeheads. The wheels were sometimes buried to the axles in sand, and\r\nthe draught bullocks were rather in the way than otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe body of water over which we ferried, was not above 80 yards wide.\r\nIn the rains, when the whole space of three miles is one rapid flood,\r\n10 or 12 feet deep, charged with yellow sand, this river must present\r\nan imposing spectacle. I walked across the dry portion, observing the\r\nsand-waves, all ranged in one direction, perpendicular to that of the\r\nprevailing wind, accurately representing the undulations of the\r\nocean, as seen from a mast-head or high cliff. As the sand was finer\r\nor coarser, so did the surface resemble a gentle ripple, or an\r\nocean-swell. The progressive motion of the waves was curious, and\r\ncaused by the lighter particles being blown over the ridges, and\r\nfilling up the hollows to leeward. There were a few islets in the\r\nsand, a kind of oases of mud and clay, in laminae no thicker than\r\npaper, and these were at once denizened by various weeds. Some large\r\nspots were green with wheat and barley-crops, both suffering\r\nfrom smut.\r\n\r\nWe encamped close to the western shore, at the village of Dearee\r\n(alt. 330 feet); it marks the termination of the Kymore Hills, along\r\nwhose S.E. bases our course now lay, as we here quitted the grand\r\ntrunk road for a rarely visited country.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th we marched south up the river to Tilotho (alt. 395 feet),\r\nthrough a rich and highly cultivated country, covered with indigo,\r\ncotton, sugar-cane, safflower, castor-oil, poppy, and various grains.\r\nDodders (_Cuscuta_) covered even tall trees with a golden web,\r\nand the _Capparis acuminata_ was in full flower along the road\r\nside. Tilotho, a beautiful village, is situated in a superb grove of\r\nMango, Banyan, Peepul, Tamarind, and _Bassia._ The Date or\r\ntoddy-palm and fan-palm are very abundant and tall: each had a pot\r\nhung under the crown. The natives climb these trunks with a hoop or\r\ncord round the body and both ancles, and a bottle-gourd or other\r\nvessel hanging round the neck to receive the juice from the\r\nstock-bottle, in this aerial wine-cellar. These palms were so lofty\r\nthat the climbers, as they paused in their ascent to gaze with wonder\r\nat our large retinue, resembled monkeys rather than men. Both trees\r\nyield a toddy, but in this district they stated that that from the\r\n_Phoenix_ (Date) alone ferments, and is distilled; while in\r\nother parts of India, the _Borassus_ (fan-palm) is chiefly\r\nemployed. I walked to the hills, over a level cultivated country\r\ninterspersed with occasional belts of low wood; in which the pensile\r\nnests of the weaver-bird were abundant, but generally hanging out of\r\nreach, in prickly _Acacias._\r\n\r\nThe hills here present a straight precipitous wall of horizontally\r\nstratified sandstone, very like the rocks at the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nwith occasionally a shallow valley, and a slope of debris at the\r\nbase, densely clothed with dry jungle. The cliffs are about 1000 feet\r\nhigh, and the plants similar to those at the foot of Paras-nath, but\r\nstunted: I climbed to the top, the latter part by steps or ledges of\r\nsandstone. The summit was clothed with long grass, trees of\r\n_Diospyros_ and _Terminalia,_ and here and there the\r\n_Boswellia._ On the precipitous rocks the curious white-barked\r\n_Sterculia foetida_ \"flung its arms abroad,\" leafless, and\r\nlooking as if blasted by lightning.\r\n\r\nA hole was sunk here again for the thermometers, and, as usual, with\r\ngreat labour; the temperatures obtained were--\r\nAir.\r\n9 p.m.    64.5 degrees\r\n5.30 a.m. 58.5 degrees\r\n4 feet 6 inches, under good shade of trees\r\n9 p.m.    77 degrees\r\n11 p.m.   76 degrees\r\n5.30 a.m. 76 degrees\r\n\r\nThis is a very great rise (of 4 degrees) above any of those\r\npreviously obtained, and certainly indicates a much higher mean\r\ntemperature of the locality. I can only suppose it due to the\r\nradiation of heat from the long range of sandstone cliff, exposed to\r\nthe south, which overlooks the flat whereon we were encamped, and\r\nwhich, though four or five miles off, forms a very important feature.\r\nThe differences of temperature in the shade taken on this and the\r\nother side of the river are 2.75 degrees higher on this side.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th we marched to Akbarpore (alt. 400. feet), a village\r\noverhung by the rocky precipice of Rotasghur, a spur of the Kymore,\r\nstanding abruptly forward.\r\n\r\nThe range, in proceeding up the Soane valley, gradually approaches\r\nthe river, and beds of non-fossiliferous limestone are seen\r\nprotruding below the sandstone and occasionally rising into rounded\r\nhills, the paths upon which appear as white as do those through the\r\nchalk districts of England. The overlying beds of sandstone are\r\nnearly horizontal, or with a dip to the N.W.; the subjacent ones of\r\nlimestone dip at a greater angle. Passing between the river and a\r\ndetached conical hill of limestone, capped with a flat mass of\r\nsandstone, the spur of Rotas broke suddenly on the view, and very\r\ngrand it was, quite realising my anticipations of the position of\r\nthese eyrie-like hill-forts of India. To the left of the spur winds\r\nthe valley of the Soane, with low-wooded hills on its opposite bank,\r\nand a higher range, connected with that of Behar, in the distance.\r\nTo the right, the hills sweep round, forming an immense and\r\nbeautifully wooded amphitheatre, about four miles deep, bounded with\r\na continuation of the escarpment. At the foot of the crowned spur is\r\nthe village of Akbarpore, where we encamped in a Mango tope;* [On the\r\n24th of June, 1848, the Soane rose to an unprecedented height, and\r\nlaid this grove of Mangos three feet under water.] it occupies some\r\npretty undulating limestone hills, amongst which several streams flow\r\nfrom the amphitheatre to the Soane.\r\n\r\nDuring our two days' stay here, I had the advantage of the society of\r\nMr. C. E. Davis, who was our guide during some rambles in the\r\nneighbourhood, and to whose experience, founded on the best habits of\r\nobservation, I am indebted for much information. At noon we started\r\nto ascend to the palace, on the top of the spur. On the way we passed\r\na beautiful well, sixty feet deep, and with a fine flight of steps to\r\nthe bottom. Now neglected and overgrown with flowering weeds and\r\ncreepers, it afforded me many of the plants I had only previously\r\nobtained in a withered state; it was curious to observe there some of\r\nthe species of the hill-tops, whose seeds doubtless are scattered\r\nabundantly over the surrounding plains, and only vegetate where they\r\nfind a coolness and moisture resembling that of the altitude they\r\nelsewhere affect. A fine fig-tree growing out of the stone-work\r\nspread its leafy green branches over the well mouth, which was about\r\ntwelve feet square; its roots assumed a singular form, enveloping two\r\nsides of the walls with a beautiful net-work, which at _high-water\r\nmark_ (rainy season), abruptly divides into thousands of little\r\nbrushes, dipping into the water which they fringe. It was a pretty\r\ncool place to descend to, from a temperature of 80 degrees above, to\r\n74 degrees at the bottom, where the water was 60 degrees; and most\r\nrefreshing to look, either up the shaft to the green fig shadowing\r\nthe deep profound, or along the sloping steps through a vista of\r\nflowering herbs and climbing plants, to the blue heaven of a\r\nburning sky.\r\n\r\nThe ascent to Rotas is over the dry hills of limestone, covered with\r\na scrubby brushwood, to a crest where are the first rude and ruined\r\ndefences. The limestone is succeeded by the sandstone cliff cut into\r\nsteps, which led from ledge to ledge and gap to gap, well guarded\r\nwith walls and an archway of solid masonry. Through this we passed on\r\nto the flat summit of the Kymore hills, covered with grass and\r\nforest, intersected by paths in all directions. The ascent is about\r\n1200 feet--a long pull in the blazing sun of February. The turf\r\nconsists chiefly of spear-grass and _Andropogon muricatus,_ the\r\nkus-kus, which yields a favourite fragrant oil, used as a medicine in\r\nIndia. The trees are of the kinds mentioned before. A pretty\r\noctagonal summer-house, with its roof supported by pillars, occupies\r\none of the highest points of the plateau, and commands a superb view\r\nof the scenery before described. From this a walk of three miles\r\nleads through the woods to the palace. The buildings are very\r\nextensive, and though now ruinous, bear evidence of great beauty in\r\nthe architecture: light galleries, supported by slender columns, long\r\ncool arcades, screened squares and terraced walks, are the principal\r\nfeatures. The rooms open out upon flat roofs, commanding views of the\r\nlong endless table-land to the west, and a sheer precipice of 1000\r\nfeet on the other side, with the Soane, the amphitheatre of hills,\r\nand the village of Akbarpore below.\r\n\r\nThis and Beejaghur, higher up the Soane, were amongst the most\r\nrecently reduced forts, and this was further the last of those\r\nwrested from Baber in 1542. Some of the rooms are still habitable,\r\nbut the greater part are ruinous, and covered with climbers, both of\r\nwild flowers and of the naturalised garden plants of the adjoining\r\nshrubbery; the _Arbor-tristis,_ with _Hibiscus, Abutilon,_\r\netc., and above all, the little yellow-flowered _Linaria\r\nramosissima,_ crawling over every ruined wall, as we see the\r\nwalls of our old English castles clothed with its congener\r\n_L. Cymbalaria._\r\n\r\nIn the old dark stables I observed the soil to be covered with a\r\ncopious evanescent efflorescence of nitrate of lime, like soap-suds\r\nscattered about.\r\n\r\nI made Rotas Palace 1490 feet above the sea, so that this table-land\r\nis here only fifty feet higher than that I had crossed on the grand\r\ntrunk road, before descending at the Dunwah pass. Its mean\r\ntemperature is of course considerably (4 degrees) below that of the\r\nvalley, but though so cool, agues prevail after the rains.\r\nThe extremes of temperature are less marked than in the valley, which\r\nbecomes excessively heated, and where hot winds sometimes last for a\r\nweek, blowing in furious gusts.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the whole neighbourhood has of late changed\r\nmaterially; and the fall of rain has much diminished, consequent on\r\nfelling the forests; even within six years the hail-storms have been\r\nfar less frequent and violent. The air on the hills is highly\r\nelectrical, owing, no doubt, to the dryness of the atmosphere, and to\r\nthis the frequent recurrence of hail-storms may be due.\r\n\r\nThe zoology of these regions is tolerably copious, but little is\r\nknown of the natural history of a great part of the plateau; a native\r\ntribe, prone to human sacrifices, is talked of. Tigers are common,\r\nand bears are numerous; they have, besides, the leopard, panther,\r\nviverine cat, and civet; and of the dog tribe the pariah, jackal,\r\nfox, and wild dog, called Koa. Deer are very numerous, of six or\r\nseven kinds. A small alligator inhabits the hill streams, said to be\r\na very different animal from either of the Soane species.\r\n\r\nDuring our descent we examined several instances of ripple-mark\r\n(fossil waves' footsteps) in the sandstone; they resembled the\r\nfluting of the _Sigillaria_ stems, in the coal-measures, and\r\noccurring as they did here, in sandstone, a little above great beds\r\nof limestone, had been taken for such, and as indications of coal.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we visited Rajghat, a steep ghat or pass leading\r\nup the cliff to Rotas Palace, a little higher up the river. We took\r\nthe elephants to the mouth of the glen, where we dismounted, and\r\nwhence we followed a stream abounding in small fish and aquatic\r\ninsects (_Dytisci_ and _Gyrini_), through a close jungle,\r\nto the foot of the cliffs, where there are indications of coal.\r\nThe woods were full of monkeys, and amongst other plants I observed\r\n_Murraya exotica,_ but it was scarce. Though the jungle was so\r\ndense, the woods were very dry, containing no Palm, _Adroideae,_\r\nPeppers, _Orchideae_ or Ferns. Here, at the foot of the red\r\ncliffs, which towered imposingly above, as seen through the tree\r\ntops, are several small seams of coaly matter in the sandstone, with\r\nabundance of pyrites, sulphur, and copious efflorescences of salts of\r\niron; but no coal. The springs from the cliffs above are charged with\r\nlime, of which enormous tuff beds are deposited on the sandstone,\r\nfull of impressions of the leaves and stems of the surrounding trees,\r\nwhich, however, I found it very difficult to recognize, and could not\r\nhelp contrasting this circumstance with the fact that geologists,\r\nunskilled in botany, see no difficulty in referring equally imperfect\r\nremains of extinct vegetables to existing genera. In some parts of\r\ntheir course the streams take up quantities of the efflorescence,\r\nwhich they scatter over the sandstones in a singular manner.\r\n\r\nAt Akbarpore I had sunk two thermometers, one 4 feet 6 inches, the\r\nother 5 feet 6 inches; both invariably indicated 76 degrees, the air\r\nvarying from 56 degrees to 79.5 degrees. Dew had formed every night\r\nsince leaving Dunwah, the grass being here cooled 12 degrees below\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of February we marched up the Soane to Tura, passing some\r\nlow hills of limestone, between the cliffs of the Kymore and the\r\nriver. On the shaded riverbanks grew abundance of English genera--\r\n_Cynoglossum, Veronica, Potentilla, Ranunculus sceleratus, Rumex,_\r\nseveral herbaceous _Compositae_ and _Labiatae_; _Tamarix_ formed a\r\nsmall bush in rocky hillocks in the bed of the river, and in pools\r\nwere several aquatic plants, _Zannichellia, Chara,_ a pretty little\r\n_Vallisneria,_ and _Potamogeton._ The Brahminee goose was common\r\nhere, and we usually saw in the morning immense flocks of wild geese\r\noverhead, migrating northward.\r\n\r\nHere I tried again the effect of solar and nocturnal radiation on the\r\nsand, at different depths, not being able to do so on the alluvium.\r\n\r\nNoon:\r\nTemperature of air 87 degrees\r\nSurface      110 degrees\r\n1 inch       102 degrees\r\n2 inches      93.5 degrees\r\n4 inches      84 degrees\r\n8 inches      77 degrees (sand wet)\r\n16 inches     76 degrees (sand wet)\r\nDaylight of following morning:\r\nSurface       52 degrees\r\n1 inch        55 degrees\r\n2 inches      58 degrees\r\n4 inches      67 degrees\r\n8 inches      73 degrees (sand wet)\r\n16 inches     74 degrees (sand wet)\r\n\r\nFrom Tura our little army again crossed the Soane, the scarped cliffs\r\nof the Kymore approaching close to the river on the west side.\r\nThe bed is very sandy, and about one mile and a half across.\r\n\r\nThe elephants were employed again, as at Baroon, to push the cart:\r\none of them had a bump in consequence, as large as a child's head,\r\njust above the trunk, and bleeding much; but the brave beast\r\ndisregarded this, when the word of command was given by his driver.\r\n\r\nThe stream was very narrow, but deep and rapid, obstructed with beds\r\nof coarse agate, jasper, cornelian and chalcedony pebbles. A clumsy\r\nboat took us across to the village of Soanepore, a wretched\r\ncollection of hovels. The crops were thin and poor, and I saw no\r\npalms or good trees. Squirrels however abounded, and were busy laying\r\nup their stores; descending from the trees they scoured across a road\r\nto a field of tares, mounted the hedge, took an observation, foraged\r\nand returned up the tree with their booty, quickly descended, and\r\nrepeated the operation of reconnoitering and plundering.\r\n\r\nThe bed of the river is here considerably above that at Dearee, where\r\nthe mean of the observations with those of Baroon, made it about 300\r\nfeet. The mean of those taken here and on the opposite side, at Tura,\r\ngives about 400 feet, indicating a fall of 100 feet in only 40 miles.\r\n\r\nNear this the sandy banks of the Soane were full of martins' nests,\r\neach one containing a pair of eggs. The deserted ones were literally\r\ncrammed full of long-legged spiders (_Opilio_), which could be\r\nraked out with a stick, when they came pouring down the cliff like\r\ncorn from a sack; the quantities are quite inconceivable. I did not\r\nobserve the martin feed on them.\r\n\r\nThe entomology here resembled that of Europe, more than I had\r\nexpected in a tropical country, where predaceous beetles, at least\r\n_Carabideae_ and _Staphylinideae,_ are generally considered\r\nrare. The latter tribes swarmed under the clods, of many species but\r\nall small, and so singularly active that I could not give the time to\r\ncollect many. In the banks again, the round egg-like earthy chrysalis\r\nof the _Sphynx Atropos_ (?) and the many-celled nidus of the\r\nleaf-cutter bee, were very common.\r\n\r\nA large columnar _Euphorbia_ (_E. ligulata_) is common all along the\r\nSoane, and I observed it to be used everywhere for fencing. I had not\r\nremarked the _E. neriifolia_; and the _E. tereticaulis_ had been very\r\nrarely seen since leaving Calcutta. The _Cactus_ is nowhere found; it\r\nis abundant in many parts of Bengal, but certainly not indigenous.\r\n\r\nIllustration --CROSSING THE SOANE, WITH THE KYMORE HILLS IN THE\r\nDISTANCE.\r\n\r\nFrom this place onwards up the Soane, there was no road of any kind,\r\nand we were compelled to be our own road engineers. The sameness of\r\nthe vegetation and lateness of the season made me regret this the\r\nless, for I was disappointed in my anticipations of finding\r\nluxuriance and novelty in these wilds. Before us the valley narrowed\r\nconsiderably, the forest became denser, the country on the south side\r\nwas broken with rounded hills, and on the north the noble cliffs of\r\nthe Kymore dipped down to the river. The villages were smaller, more\r\nscattered and poverty-stricken, with the Mahowa and Mango as the\r\nusual trees; the banyan, peepul, and tamarind being rare. The native,\r\nare of an aboriginal jungle race; and are tall, athletic, erect, much\r\nless indolent and more spirited than the listless natives of\r\nthe plains.\r\n\r\n_February_ 21.--Started at daylight: but so slow and difficult\r\nwas our progress through fields and woods, and across deep gorges\r\nfrom the hills, that we only advanced five miles in the day; the\r\nelephant's head too was aching too badly to let him push, and the\r\ncattle would not proceed when the draught was not equal. What was\r\nworse, it was impossible to get them to pull together up the inclined\r\nplanes we cut, except by placing a man at the head of each of the\r\nsix, eight, or ten in a team, and simultaneously screwing round their\r\ntails; when one tortured animal sometimes capsizes the vehicle.\r\nThe small carts got on better, though it was most nervous to see them\r\nrushing down the steeps, especially those with our fragile\r\ninstruments, etc.\r\n\r\nKosdera, where we halted, is a pretty place, elevated 440 feet, with\r\na broad stream front the hills flowing past it. These hills are of\r\nlimestone, and rounded, resting upon others of hornstone and jasper.\r\nFollowing up the stream I came to some rapids, where the stream is\r\ncrossed by large beds of hornstone and porphyry rocks, excessively\r\nhard, and pitched up at right angles, or with a bold dip to the\r\nnorth. The number of strata was very great, and only a few inches or\r\neven lines thick: they presented all varieties of jasper, hornstone,\r\nand quartz of numerous colours, with occasional seams of porphyry or\r\nbreccia. The racks were elegantly fringed with a fern I had not\r\nhitherto seen, _Polypodium proliferum,_ which is the only\r\nspecies the Soane valley presents at this season.\r\n\r\nReturning over the hills, I found _Hardwickia binata,_ a most\r\nelegant leguminous tree, tall, erect, with an elongated coma, and the\r\nbranches pendulous. These trees grew in a shallow bed of alluvium,\r\nenclosing abundance of agate pebbles and kunker, the former derived\r\nfrom the quartzy strata above noticed.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd and 24th we continued to follow up the Soane, first to\r\nPanchadurma (alt. 490 feet), and thence to Pepura (alt. 587 feet),\r\nthe country becoming densely wooded, very wild, and picturesque, the\r\nwoods being full of monkeys, parrots, peacocks, hornbills, and wild\r\nanimals. _Strychnos potatorum,_ whose berries are used to purify\r\nwater, forms a dense foliaged tree, 30 to 60 feet high, some\r\nindividuals pale yellow, others deep green, both in apparent health.\r\n_Feronia Elephantum_ and _Aegle marmelos_* [The Bhel fruit, lately\r\nintroduced into English medical practice, as an astringent of great\r\neffect, in cases of diarrhoea and dysentery.] were very abundant,\r\nwith _Sterculia,_ and the dwarf date-palm.\r\n\r\nOne of my carts was here hopelessly broken down; advancing on the\r\nspokes instead of the tire of the wheels. By the banks of a deep\r\ngully here the rocks are well exposed: they consist of soft clay\r\nshales resting on the limestone, which is nearly horizontal; and this\r\nagain, unconformably on the quartz and hornstone rocks, which are\r\nconfused, and tilted up at all angles.\r\n\r\nA spur of the Kymore, like that of Rotas, here projects to the bed of\r\nthe river, and was blazing at night with the beacon-like fires of the\r\nnatives, lighted to scare the tigers and bears from the spots where\r\nthey cut wood and bamboo; they afforded a splendid spectacle, the\r\nflames in some places leaping zig-zag from hill to hill in front of\r\nus, and looking as if a gigantic letter W were written in fire.\r\n\r\nThe night was bright and clear, with much lightning, the latter\r\nattracted to the spur, and darting down as it were to mingle its fire\r\nwith that of the forest; so many flashes appeared to strike on the\r\nflames, that it is probable the heated air in their neighbourhood\r\nattracted them. We were awakened between 3 and 4 a.m., by a violent\r\ndust-storm, which threatened to carry away the tents. Our position at\r\nthe mouth of the gulley formed by the opposite hills, no doubt\r\naccounted for it. The gusts were so furious that it was impossible to\r\nobserve the barometer, which I returned to its case on ascertaining\r\nthat any indications of a rise or fall in the column must have been\r\nquite trifling. The night had been oppressively hot, with many\r\ninsects flying about; amongst which I noticed earwigs, a genus\r\nerroneously supposed rarely to take to the wing in Britain.\r\n\r\nAt 8.30 a.m. it suddenly fell calm, and we proceeded to Chanchee\r\n(alt. 500 feet), the native carts breaking down in their passage over\r\nthe projecting beds of flinty rocks, or as they burned down the\r\ninclined planes we cut through the precipitous clay banks of the\r\nstreams. Near Chanchee we passed an alligator, just killed by two\r\nmen, a foul beast, about nine feet long, of the mugger kind.\r\nMore absorbing than its natural history was the circumstance of its\r\nhaving swallowed a child, that was playing in the water as its mother\r\nwas washing her utensils in the river. The brute was hardly dead,\r\nmuch distended by the prey, and the mother was standing beside it.\r\nA very touching group was this: the parent with her hands clasped in\r\nagony, unable to withdraw her eyes from the cursed reptile, which\r\nstill clung to life with that tenacity for which its tribe are so\r\nconspicuous; beside these the two athletes leaned on the bloody\r\nbamboo staffs, with which they had all but despatched the animal.\r\n\r\nThis poor woman earned a scanty maintenance by making catechu:\r\ninhabiting a little cottage, and having no property but two cattle to\r\nbring wood from the hills, and a very few household chattels; and how\r\nfew of these they only know who have seen the meagre furniture of\r\nDanga hovels. Her husband cut the trees in the forest and dragged\r\nthem to the hut, but at this time he was sick, and her only boy, her\r\nfuture stay, it was, whom the beast had devoured.\r\n\r\nThis province is famous for the quantity of catechu its dry forests\r\nyield. The plant (_Acacia_) is a little thorny tree, erect, and\r\nbearing a rounded head of well remembered prickly branches. Its wood\r\nis yellow, with a dark brick-red heart, most profitable in January\r\nand useless in June (for yielding the extract).\r\n\r\nIllustration -- SOANE VALLEY AND KYMORE HILLS COCHLOSPERMUM GOSSYPIUM\r\nAND BUTEA FRONDOSA IN FLOWER.\r\n\r\nThe _Butea frondosa_ was abundantly in flower here, and a gorgeous\r\nsight. In mass the inflorescence resembles sheets of flame, and\r\nindividually the flowers are eminently beautiful, the bright\r\norange-red petals contrasting brilliantly against the jet-black\r\nvelvety calyx. The nest of the _Megachile_ (leaf-cutter bee) was in\r\nthousands in the cliffs, with Mayflies, Caddis-worms, spiders, and\r\nmany predaceous beetles. Lamellicorn beetles were very rare, even\r\n_Aphodius,_ and of _Cetoniae_ I did not see one.\r\n\r\nWe marched on the 28th to Kota, at the junction of the river of that\r\nname with the Soane, over hills of flinty rock, which projected\r\neverywhere, to the utter ruin of the elephants' feet, and then over\r\nundulating hills of limestone; on the latter I found trees of\r\n_Cochlospermum,_ whose curious thick branches spread out\r\nsomewhat awkwardly, each tipped with a cluster of golden yellow\r\nflowers, as large as the palm of the hand, and very beautiful: it is\r\na tropical Gum-Cistus in the appearance and texture of the petals,\r\nand their frail nature. The bark abounds in a transparent gum, of\r\nwhich the white ants seem fond, for they had killed many trees.\r\nOf the leaves the curious rude leaf-bellows are made, with which the\r\nnatives of these hills smelt iron. Scorpions appeared very common\r\nhere, of a small kind, 1.5 inch long; several were captured, and one\r\nof our party was stung on the finger; the smart was burning for an\r\nhour or two, and then ceased.\r\n\r\nAt Kota we were nearly opposite the cliffs at Beejaghur, where coal\r\nis reported to exist; and here we again crossed the Soane, and for\r\nthe last time. The ford is three miles up the river, and we marched\r\nto it through deep sand. The bed of the river is here 500 feet above\r\nthe sea, and about three-quarters of a mile broad, the rapid stream\r\nbeing 50 or 60 yards wide, and breast deep. The sand is firm and\r\nsiliceous, with no mica; nodules of coal are said to be washed down\r\nthus far from the coal-beds of Burdee, a good deal higher up, but we\r\nsaw none.\r\n\r\nThe cliffs come close to the river on the opposite side, their bases\r\nclothed with woods which teemed with birds. The soil is richer, and\r\nindividual trees, especially of _Bombax, Terminalia_ and _Mahowa,_\r\nvery fine; one tree of the _Hardwickia,_ about 120 feet high, was as\r\nhandsome a monarch of the forest as I ever saw, and it is not often\r\nthat one sees trees in the tropics, which for a combination of beauty\r\nin outline, harmony of colour, and arrangement of branches and\r\nfoliage, would form so striking an addition to an English park.\r\n\r\nThere is a large break in the Kymore hills here, beyond the village\r\nof Kunch, through which our route lay to Beejaghur, and the Ganges at\r\nMirzapore; the cliff's leaving the river and trending to the north in\r\na continuous escarpment flanked with low ranges of rounded hills, and\r\nterminating in an abrupt spur (Mungeesa Peak) whose summit was\r\ncovered with a ragged forest. At Kunch we saw four alligators\r\nsleeping in the river, looking at a distance like logs of wood, all\r\nof the short-nosed or mugger kind, dreaded by man and beast; I saw\r\nnone of the sharp-shouted (or garial), so common on the Ganges, where\r\ntheir long bills, with a garniture of teeth and prominent eyes\r\npeeping out of the water, remind one of geological lectures and\r\nvisions of _Ichthyosauri._ Tortoises were frequent in the river,\r\nbasking on the rocks, and popping into the water when approached.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of March we left the Soane, and struck inland over a rough\r\nhilly country, covered with forest, fully 1000 feet below the top of\r\nthe Kymore table-land, which here recedes from the river and\r\nsurrounds an undulating plain, some ten miles either way, facing the\r\nsouth. The roads, or rather pathways, were very bad, and quite\r\nimpassable for the carts without much engineering, cutting through\r\nforest, smoothing down the banks of the watercourses to be crossed,\r\nand clearing away the rocks as we best might. We traversed the empty\r\nbed of a mountain torrent, with perpendicular banks of alluvium 30\r\nfeet high, and thence plunged into a dense forest. Our course was\r\ndirected towards Mungeesa Peak, the remarkable projecting spur,\r\nbetween which and a conical hill the path led. Whether on the\r\nelephants or on foot, the thorny jujubes, _Acacias,_ etc. were\r\nmost troublesome, and all our previous scratchings were nothing to\r\nthis. Peacocks and jungle-fowl were very frequent, the squabbling of\r\nthe former and the hooting of the monkeys constantly grating on the\r\near. There were innumerable pigeons and a few Floricans (a kind of\r\nbustard--considered the best eating game--bird in India). From the\r\ndefile we emerged on an open flat, halting at Sulkun, a scattered\r\nvillage (alt. 684 feet), peopled by a bold-looking race (Coles)* [The\r\nColes, like the Danghas of the Rajmahal and Behar hills, and the\r\nnatives of the mountains of the peninsula, form one of the aboriginal\r\ntribes of British India, and are widely different people from either\r\nthe Hindoos or Mussulmen.] who habitually carry the spear and shield.\r\nWe had here the pleasure of meeting Mr. Felle, an English gentleman\r\nemployed in the Revenue department; this being one of the roads along\r\nwhich the natives transport their salt, sugar, etc., from one\r\nprovince to another.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, I examined the conical hill, which, like that near\r\nRotas, is of stratified beds of limestone, capped with sandstone.\r\nA stream runs round its base, cutting through the alluvium to the\r\nsubjacent rock, which is exposed, and contains flattened spheres of\r\nlimestone. These spheres are from the size of a fist to a child's\r\nhead, or even much larger; they are excessively hard, and neither\r\nlaminated nor formed of concentric layers. At the top of the hill the\r\nsandstone cap was perpendicular on all sides, and its dry top covered\r\nwith small trees, especially of _Cochlospermum._ A few larger\r\ntrees of _Fici_ clung to the edge of the rocks, and by forcing\r\ntheir roots into the interstices detached enormous masses, affording\r\ngood dens for bears and other wild animals. From the top, the view of\r\nrock, river, forest, and plain, was very fine, the eye ranging over a\r\nbroad flat, girt by precipitous hills;--West, the Kymore or Vindhya\r\nrange rose again in rugged elevations; South, flowed the Soane,\r\nbacked by ranges of wooded hills, smoking like volcanos with the\r\nfires of the natives;--below, lay the bed of the stream we had left\r\nat the foot of the hills, cutting its way through the alluvium, and\r\nfollowing a deep gorge to the Soane, which was there hidden by the\r\nrugged heights we had crossed, on which the greater part of our camp\r\nmight be seen still straggling onwards;--east, and close above us,\r\nthe bold spur of Mungeesa shot up, terminating a continuous stretch\r\nof red precipices, clothed with forest along their bases, and over\r\ntheir horizontal tops.\r\n\r\nFrom Sulkun the view of the famed fort and palace of Beejaghur is\r\nvery singular, planted on the summit of an isolated hill of\r\nsandstone, about ten miles off. A large tree by the palace marks its\r\nsite; for, at this distance, the buildings are themselves\r\nundistinguishable.\r\n\r\nThere are many tigers on these hills; and as one was close by, and\r\nhad killed several cattle, Mr. Felle kindly offered us a chance of\r\nslaying him. Bullocks are tethered out, over-night, in the places\r\nlikely to be visited by the brute; he kills one of them, and is from\r\nthe spot tracked to his haunt by natives, who visit the stations\r\nearly in the morning, and report the whereabouts of his lair.\r\nThe sportsman then goes to the attack mounted on an elephant, or\r\nhaving a roost fixed in a tree, on the trail of the tiger, and he\r\nemploys some hundred natives to drive the animal past the\r\nlurking-place.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, the locale of the tiger was doubtful; but it\r\nwas thought that by beating over several miles of country he (or at\r\nany rate, some other game) might be driven past a certain spot.\r\nThither, accordingly, the natives were sent, who built machans\r\n(stages) in the trees, high out of danger's reach; Mr. Theobald and\r\nmyself occupied one of these perches in a _Hardwickia_ tree, and\r\nMr. Felle another, close by, both on the slope of a steep hill,\r\nsurrounded by jungly valleys. We were also well thatched in with\r\nleafy boughs, to prevent the wary beast from espying the ambush, and\r\nhad a whole stand of shall arms ready for his reception.\r\n\r\nWhen roosted aloft, and duly charged to keep profound silence (which\r\nI obeyed to the letter, by falling sound asleep), the word was passed\r\nto the beaters, who surrounded our post on the plain-side, extending\r\nsome miles in line, and full two or three distant from us.\r\nThey entered the jungle, beating tom-toms, singing and shouting as\r\nthey advanced, and converging towards our position. In the noonday\r\nsolitude of these vast forests, our situation was romantic enough:\r\nthere was not a breath of wind, an insect or bird stirring; and the\r\nwild cries of the men, and the hollow sound of the drums broke upon\r\nthe ear from a great distance, gradually swelling and falling, as the\r\nnatives ascended the heights or crossed the valleys. After about an\r\nhour and a half, the beaters emerged from the jungle under our\r\nretreat; one by one, two by two, but preceded by no single living\r\nthing, either mouse, bird, deer, or bear, and much less tiger.\r\nThe beaters received about a penny a-piece for the day's work; a rich\r\nguerdon for these poor wretches, whom necessity sometimes drives to\r\nfeed on rats and offal.\r\n\r\nWe were detained three days at Sulkun, from inability to get on with\r\nthe carts; and as the pass over the Kymore to the north (on the way\r\nto Mirzapore) was to be still worse, I took advantage of Mr. Felle's\r\nkind offer of camels and elephants to make the best of my way\r\nforward, accompanying that gentleman, _en route,_ to his\r\nresidence at Shahgunj, on the table-land.\r\n\r\nBoth the climate and natural history of this flat on which Sulkun\r\nstands, are similar to those of the banks of the Soane; the crops are\r\nwretched. At this season the dryness of the atmosphere is excessive:\r\nour nails cracked, and skins peeled, whilst all articles of wood,\r\ntortoiseshell, etc., broke on the slightest blow. The air, too, was\r\nalways highly electrical, and the dew-point was frequently 40 degrees\r\nbelow the temperature of the air.\r\n\r\nThe natives are far from honest: they robbed one of the tents placed\r\nbetween two others, wherein a light was burning. One gentleman in it\r\nwas awake, and on turning saw five men at his bedside, who escaped\r\nwith a bag of booty, in the shape of clothes, and a tempting strong\r\nbrass-bound box, containing private letters. The clothes they dropped\r\noutside, but the box of letters was carried off. There were about a\r\nhundred people asleep outside the tents, between whose many fires the\r\nrogues must have passed, eluding also the guard, who were, or ought\r\nto have been, awake.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEk-powa Ghat -- Sandstones -- Shahgunj -- Table-land, elevation, etc.\r\n-- Gum-arabic -- Mango -- Fair -- Aquatic plants -- Rujubbund --\r\nStorm -- False sunset and sunrise -- Bind hills -- Mirzapore --\r\nManufactures, imports, etc. -- Climate of -- Thuggee -- Chunar --\r\nBenares -- Mosque -- Observatory -- Sar-nath -- Ghazeepore --\r\nRose-gardens -- Manufactory of Attar -- Lord Cornwallis' tomb --\r\nGanges, scenery and natural history of -- Pelicans -- Vegetation --\r\nInsects -- Dinapore -- Patna -- Opium godowns and manufacture --\r\nMudar, white and purple -- Monghyr islets -- Hot Springs of Setakoond\r\n-- Alluvium of Ganges -- Rocks of Sultun-gunj -- Bhaugulpore --\r\nTemples of Mt. Manden -- Coles and native tribes -- Bhaugulpore\r\nrangers -- Horticultural gardens.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of March I bade farewell to Mr. Williams and his kind\r\nparty, and rode over a plain to the village of Markunda, at the foot\r\nof the Ghat. There the country becomes very rocky and wooded, and a\r\nstream is crossed, which runs over a flat bed of limestone, cracked\r\ninto the appearance of a tesselated pavement. For many miles there is\r\nno pass over the Kymore range, except this, significantly called\r\n\"Ek-powa-Ghat\" (one-foot Ghat). It is evidently a _fault,_ or\r\nshifting of the rocks, producing so broken a cliff as to admit of a\r\npath winding over the shattered crags. On either side, the precipices\r\nare extremely steep, of horizontally stratified rocks, continued in\r\nan unbroken line, and the views across the plain and Soane valley,\r\nover which the sun was now setting, were superb. At the summit we\r\nentered on a dead flat plain or table-land, with no hills, except\r\nalong the brim of the broad valley we had left, where are some\r\ncurious broad pyramids, formed of slabs of sandstone arranged in\r\nsteps. By dark we reached the village of Roump (alt. 1090 feet),\r\nbeyond the top of the pass.\r\n\r\nOn the next day I proceeded on a small, fast, and wofully\r\nhigh-trotting elephant, to Shahgunj, where I enjoyed Mr. Felle's\r\nhospitality for a few days. The country here, though elevated, is,\r\nfrom the nature of the soil and formation, much more fertile than\r\nwhat I had left. Water is abundant, both in tanks and wells, and\r\nrice-fields, broad and productive, cover the ground; while groves of\r\ntamarinds and mangos, now loaded with blossoms, occur at\r\nevery village.\r\n\r\nIt is very singular that the elevation of this table-land (1100 feet\r\nat Shahgunj) should coincide with that of the granite range of Upper\r\nBengal, where crossed by the grand trunk road, though they have no\r\nfeature but the presence of alluvium in common. Scarce a hillock\r\nvaries the surface here, and the agricultural produce of the two is\r\nwidely different. Here the flat ledges of sandstone retain the\r\nmoisture, and give rise to none of those impetuous torrents which\r\nsweep it off the inclined beds of gneiss, or splintered quartz.\r\nNor is there here any of the effloresced salts so forbidding to\r\nvegetation where they occur. Wherever the alluvium is deep on these\r\nhills, neither _Catechu, Olibanum, Butea, Terminalia, Diospyros,_\r\ndwarf-palm, or any of those plants are to be met with, which abound\r\nwherever the rock is superficial, and irrespectively of its\r\nmineral characters.\r\n\r\nThe gum-arabic _Acacia_ is abundant here, though not seen below,\r\nand very rare to the eastward of this meridian, for I saw but little\r\nof it in Behar. It is a plant partial to a dry climate, and rather\r\nprefers a good soil. In its distribution it in some degree follows\r\nthe range of the camel, which is its constant companion over\r\nthousands of leagues. In the valley of the Ganges I was told that\r\nneither the animal nor plant flourish east of the Soane, where I\r\nexperienced a marked change in the humidity of the atmosphere on my\r\npassage down the Ganges. It was a circumstance I was interested in,\r\nhaving first met with the camel at Teneriffe and the Cape Verd\r\nIslands, the westernmost limit of its distribution; imported thither,\r\nhowever, as it now is into Australia, where, though there is no\r\n_Acacia Arabica,_ four hundred other species of the genus\r\nare known.\r\n\r\nThe mango, which is certainly _the_ fruit of India, (as the\r\npine-apple is of the Eastern Islands, and the orange of the West,)\r\nwas now blossoming, and a superb sight. The young leaves are\r\npurplish-green, and form a curious contrast to the deep lurid hue of\r\nthe older foliage; especially when the tree is (which often occurs)\r\ndimidiate, one half the green, and the other the red shades of\r\ncolours; when in full blossom, all forms a mass of yellow, diffusing\r\na fragrance rather too strong and peculiar to be pleasant.\r\n\r\nWe passed a village where a large fair was being held, and singularly\r\nfamiliar its arrangements were to my early associations. The women\r\nand children are the prime customers; for the latter\r\nwhirl-you-go-rounds, toys, and sweetmeats were destined; to tempt the\r\nformer, little booths of gay ornaments, patches for the forehead,\r\near-rings of quaint shapes, bugles and beads. Here as at home, I\r\nremarked that the vendors of these superfluities occupy the\r\napproaches to this Vanity-Fair. As, throughout the East, the trades\r\nare congregated into particular quarters of the cities, so here the\r\nitinerants grouped themselves into little bazaars for each class of\r\ncommodity. Whilst I was engaged in purchasing a few articles of\r\nnative workmanship, my elephant made an attack on a sweetmeat stall,\r\ndemolishing a magnificent erection of barley-sugar, before his\r\nproceedings could be put a stop to.\r\n\r\nMr. Felle's bungalow (whose garden smiled with roses in this\r\nwilderness) was surrounded by a moat (fed by a spring), which was\r\nfull of aquatic plants, _Nymphaea, Damasonium, Villarsia cristata,\r\nAponogeton,_ three species of _Potamogeton,_ two of _Naias, Chara_\r\nand _Zannichellia_ (the two latter indifferently, and often together,\r\nused in the refinement of sugar). In a large tank hard by, wholly fed\r\nby rain water, I observed only the _Villarsia Indica,_ no\r\n_Aponogeton, Nymphaea,_ or _Dammonium,_ nor did these occur in any of\r\nthe other tanks I examined, which were otherwise well peopled with\r\nplants. This may not be owing to the quality of the water so much as\r\nto its varying quantity in the tank.\r\n\r\nAll around here, as at Roump, is a dead flat, except towards the\r\ncrest of the ghats which overhang the valley of the Soane, and there\r\nthe sandstone rock rises by steps into low hills. During a ride to a\r\nnatural tank amongst these rocky elevations, I passed from the\r\nalluvium to the sandstone, and at once met with all the prevailing\r\nplants of the granite, gneiss, limestone and hornstone rocks\r\npreviously examined, and which I have enumerated too often to require\r\nrecapitulation; a convincing proof that the mechanical properties and\r\nnot the chemical constitution of the rocks regulate the distribution\r\nof these plants.\r\n\r\nRujubbund (the pleasant spot), is a small tarn, or more properly the\r\nexpanded bed of a stream, art having aided nature in its formation:\r\nit is edged by rocks and cliffs fringed with the usual trees of the\r\nneighbourhood; it is a wild and pretty spot, not unlike some\r\nbirch-bordered pool in the mountains of Wales or Scotland,\r\nsequestered and picturesque. It was dark before I got back, with\r\nheavy clouds and vivid lightning approaching from the south-west.\r\nThe day had been very hot (3 p.m., 90 degrees), and the evening the\r\nsame; but the barometer did not foretell the coming tempest, which\r\nbroke with fury at 7 p.m., blowing open the doors, and accompanied\r\nwith vivid lightning and heavy thunder, close by and all round,\r\nthough no rain fell.\r\n\r\nIn the clear dry mornings of these regions, a curious optical\r\nphenomena may be observed, of a _sunrise_ in the _west,_ and _sunset_\r\nin the _east._ In either case, bright and well-defined beams rise to\r\nthe zenith, often crossing to the opposite horizon. It is a beautiful\r\nfeature in the firmament, and equally visible whether the horizon be\r\ncloudy or clear, the white beams being projected indifferently\r\nagainst a dark vapour or the blue serene. The zodiacal light shines\r\nfrom an hour or two after sunset till midnight, with singular\r\nbrightness, almost equalling the milky way.\r\n\r\n_March_ 7.-Left Shahgunj for Mirzapore, following the road to\r\nGoorawal, over a dead alluvial flat without a feature to remark.\r\nTurning north from that village, the country undulates, exposing the\r\nrocky nucleus, and presenting the usual concomitant vegetation.\r\nOccasionally park-like views occurred, which, where diversified by\r\nthe rocky valleys, resemble much the noble scenery of the Forest of\r\nDean on the borders of Wales; the _Mahowa_ especially\r\nrepresenting the oak, with its spreading and often gnarled branches.\r\nMany of the exposed slabs of sandstone are beautifully waved on the\r\nsurface with the _ripple-mark_ impression.\r\n\r\nAmowee, where I arrived at 9 p.m., is on an open grassy flat, about\r\nfifteen miles from the Ganges, which is seen from the neighbourhood,\r\nflowing among trees, with the white houses, domes, and temples of\r\nMirzapore scattered around, and high above which the dust-clouds were\r\ncoursing along the horizon.\r\n\r\nMr. Money, the magistrate of Mirzapore, kindly sent a mounted\r\nmessenger to meet me here, who had vast trouble in getting bearers\r\nfor my palkee. In it I proceeded the next day to Mirzapore,\r\ndescending a steep ghat of the Bind hills by an excellent road, to\r\nthe level plains of the Ganges. Unlike the Dunwah pass, this is\r\nwholly barren. At the foot the sun was intensely hot, the roads\r\nalternately rocky and dusty, the villages thronged with a widely\r\ndifferent looking race from those of the hills, and the whole air of\r\nthe outskirts, on a sultry afternoon, far from agreeable.\r\n\r\nMirzapore is a straggling town, said to contain 100,000 inhabitants.\r\nIt flanks the river, and is built on an undulating alluvial bank,\r\nfull of kunker, elevated 360 feet above the sea, and from 50 to 80\r\nabove the present level of the river. The vicinity of the Ganges and\r\nits green bank, and the numbers of fine trees around, render it a\r\npleasing, though not a fine town. It presents the usual Asiatic\r\ncontrast of squalor and gaudiness; consisting of large squares and\r\nbroad streets, interspersed with acres of low huts and groves of\r\ntrees. It is celebrated for its manufactory of carpets, which are\r\nadmirable in appearance, and, save in durability, equal to the\r\nEnglish. Indigo seed from Bundelkund is also a most extensive article\r\nof commerce, the best coming from the Doab. For cotton, lac, sugar,\r\nand saltpetre, it is one of the greatest marts in India. The articles\r\nof native manufacture are brass washing and cooking utensils, and\r\nstone deities worked out of the sandstone.\r\n\r\nThere is little native vegetation, the country being covered with\r\ncultivation and extensive groves of mango, and occasionally of guava.\r\nEnglish vegetables are abundant and excellent, and the strawberries,\r\nwhich ripen in March, rival the European fruit in size, but hardly\r\nin flavour.\r\n\r\nDuring the few days spent at Mirzapore with my kind friend, Mr. C.\r\nHamilton, I was surprised to find the temperature of the day cooler\r\nby nearly 4 degrees than that of the hills above, or of the upper\r\npart of the Soane valley; while on the other hand the nights were\r\ndecidedly warmer. The dewpoint again was even lower in proportion,\r\n(72 degrees) and the climate consequently drier. The atmosphere was\r\nextremely dry and electrical, the hair constantly crackling when\r\ncombed. Further west, where the climate becomes still drier, the\r\nelectricity of the air is even greater. Mr. Griffith mentions in his\r\njournal that in filling barometer tubes in Affghanistan, he\r\nconstantly experienced a shock.\r\n\r\nHere I had the pleasure of meeting Lieutenant Ward, one of the\r\nsuppressors of Thuggee (_Thuggee,_ in Hindostan, signifies a\r\ndeceiver; fraud, not open force, being employed). This gentleman\r\nkindly showed me the approvers or king's evidence of his\r\nestablishment, belonging to those three classes of human scourges,\r\nthe Thug, Dakoit, and Poisoner. Of these the first was the Thug, a\r\nmild-looking man, who had been born and bred to the profession: he\r\nhad committed many murders, saw no harm in them, and felt neither\r\nshame nor remorse. His organs of observation and destructiveness were\r\nlarge, and the cerebellum small. He explained to me how the gang\r\nwaylay the unwary traveller, enter into conversation with him, and\r\nhave him suddenly seized, when the superior throws his own linen\r\ngirdle round the victim's neck and strangles him, pressing the\r\nknuckles against the spine. Taking off his own, he passed it round my\r\narm, and showed me the turn as coolly as a sailor once taught me the\r\n_hangman's knot._ The Thug is of any caste, and from any part\r\nof India. The profession have particular stations, which they\r\ngenerally select for murder, throwing the body of their victim into\r\na well.\r\n\r\nThe Dakoit (_dakhee,_ a robber) belongs to a class who rob in\r\ngangs, but never commit murder--arson and housebreaking also forming\r\npart of their profession. These are all high-class Rajpoots,\r\noriginally from Guzerat; who, on being conquered, vowed vengeance on\r\nmankind. They speak both Hindostanee and the otherwise extinct\r\nGuzerat language; this is guttural in the extreme, and very singular\r\nin sound. They are a very remarkable people, found throughout India,\r\nand called by various names; their women dress peculiarly, and are\r\nutterly devoid of modesty. The man I examined was a short, square,\r\nbut far from powerful Nepalese, with high arched eyebrows, and no\r\norgans of observation. These people are great cowards.\r\n\r\nThe Poisoners all belong to one caste, of Pasie, or dealers in toddy:\r\nthey go singly or in gangs, haunting the travellers' resting-places,\r\nwhere they drop half a rupee weight of pounded or whole _Datura_\r\nseeds into his food, producing a twenty-hours' intoxication, during\r\nwhich he is robbed, and left to recover or sink under the stupifying\r\neffects of the narcotic. He told me that the _Datura_ seed is\r\ngathered without ceremony, and at any time, place, or age of the\r\nplant. He was a dirty, ill-conditioned looking fellow, with no bumps\r\nbehind his ears, or prominence of eyebrow region, but a remarkable\r\ncerebellum.\r\n\r\nThough now all but extinct (except in Cuttack), through ten or\r\nfifteen years of unceasing vigilance on the part of Government, and\r\nincredible activity and acuteness in the officers employed, the Thugs\r\nwere formerly a wonderfully numerous body, who abstained from their\r\nvocation solely in the immediate neighbourhood of their own villages;\r\nwhich, however, were not exempt from the visits of other Thugs; so\r\nthat, as Major Sleeman says,--\"The annually returning tide of murder\r\nswept unsparingly over the whole face of India, from the Sutlej to\r\nthe sea-coast, and from the Himalaya to Cape Comorin. One narrow\r\ndistrict alone was free, the Concan, beyond the ghats, whither they\r\nnever penetrated.\" In Bengal, river Thugs replace the travelling\r\npractitioner. Candeish and Rohilkund alone harboured no Thugs as\r\nresidents, but they were nevertheless haunted by the gangs.\r\n\r\nTheir origin is uncertain, but supposed to be very ancient, soon\r\nafter the Mahommedan conquest. They now claim a divine original, and\r\nare supposed to have supernatural powers, and to be the emissaries of\r\nthe divinity, like the wolf, the tiger, and the bear. It is only\r\nlately that they have swarmed so prodigiously,--seven original gangs\r\nhaving migrated from Delhi to the Gangetic provinces about 200 years\r\nago, and from these all the rest have sprung. Many belong to the most\r\namiable, intelligent, and respectable classes of the lower and even\r\nmiddle ranks: they love their profession, regard murder as sport, and\r\nare never haunted with dreams, or troubled with pangs of conscience\r\nduring hours of solitude, or in the last moments of life. The victim\r\nis an acceptable sacrifice to the goddess Davee, who by some classes\r\nis supposed to eat the lifeless body, and thus save her votaries the\r\nnecessity of concealing it.\r\n\r\nThey are extremely superstitious, always consulting omens, such as\r\nthe direction in which a hare or jackall crosses the road; and even\r\nfar more trivial circumstances will determine the fate of a dozen of\r\npeople, and perhaps of an immense treasure. All worship the pickaxe,\r\nwhich is symbolical of their profession, and an oath sworn on it\r\nbinds closer than on the Koran. The consecration of this weapon is a\r\nmost elaborate ceremony, and takes place only under certain trees.\r\nThey rise through various grades: the lowest are scouts; the second,\r\nsextons; the third are holders of the victims' hands; the highest,\r\nstranglers.\r\n\r\nThough all agree in never practising cruelty, or robbing previous to\r\nmurder, never allowing any but infants to escape (and these are\r\ntrained to Thuggee), and never leaving a trace of such goods as may\r\nbe identified, there are several variations in their mode of\r\nconducting operations; some tribes spare certain castes, others none:\r\nmurder of woman is against all rules; but the practice crept into\r\ncertain gangs, and this it is which led to their discountenance by\r\nthe goddess Davee, and the consequent downfall of the system.\r\nDavee, they say, allowed the British to punish them, because a\r\ncertain gang had murdered the mothers to obtain their daughters to be\r\nsold to prostitution.\r\n\r\nMajor Sleeman has constructed a map demonstrating the number of\r\n\"Bails,\" or regular stations for committing murder, in the kingdom of\r\nOude alone, which is 170 miles long by 100 broad, and in which are\r\n274, which are regarded by the Thug with as much satisfaction and\r\ninterest as a game preserve is in England: nor are these \"bails\" less\r\nnumerous in other parts of India. Of twenty assassins who were\r\nexamined, one frankly confessed to having been engaged in 931\r\nmurders, and the least guilty of the number to 24. Sometimes 150\r\npersons collected into one gang, and their profits have often been\r\nimmense, the murder of six persons on one occasion yielding 82,000\r\nrupees; upwards of 8000 pounds.\r\n\r\nOf the various facilities for keeping up the system, the most\r\nprominent are, the practice amongst the natives of travelling before\r\ndawn, of travellers mixing freely together, and taking their meals by\r\nthe way-side instead of in villages; in the very Bails, in fact, to\r\nwhich they are inveigled by the Thug in the shape of a\r\nfellow-traveller; money remittances are also usually made by\r\ndisguised travellers, whose treasure is exposed at the custom-houses,\r\nand, worst of all, the bankers will never own to the losses they\r\nsustain, which, as a visitation of God, would, if avenged, lead, they\r\nthink, to future, and perhaps heavier punishment. Had the Thugs\r\ndestroyed Englishmen, they would quickly have been put down; but the\r\nsystem being invariably practised on a class of people acknowledging\r\nthe finger of the Deity in its execution, its glaring enormities were\r\nlong in rousing the attention of the Indian Government.\r\n\r\nA few examples of the activity exercised by the suppressors may be\r\ninteresting. They act wholly through the information given by\r\napprovers, who are simply king's evidences. Of 600 Thugs engaged in\r\nthe murder of 64 people, and the plunder of nearly 20,000 pounds, all\r\nexcept seventy were captured in ten years, though separated into six\r\ngangs, and their operations continued from 1826 to 1830:\r\nthe last party was taken in 1836. And again, between the years 1826\r\nand 1835, 1562 Thugs were seized, of whom 382 were hanged, and 909\r\ntransported; so that now it is but seldom these wretches are ever\r\nheard of.\r\n\r\nTo show the extent of their operations I shall quote an anecdote from\r\nSleeman's Reports (to which I am indebted for most of the above\r\ninformation). He states that he was for three years in charge of a\r\ndistrict on the Nerbudda, and considered himself acquainted with\r\nevery circumstance that occurred in the neighbourhood; yet, during\r\nthat time, 100 people were murdered and buried within less than a\r\nquarter of a mile of his own residence!\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and fifty boats full of river Thugs, in crews of fifteen,\r\ninfested the Ganges between Benares and Calcutta, during five months\r\nof every year, under pretence of conveying pilgrims. Travellers along\r\nthe banks were tracked, and offered a passage, which if refused in\r\nthe first boat was probably accepted in some other. At a given signal\r\nthe crews rushed in, doubled up the decoyed victim, broke his back,\r\nand threw him into the river, where floating corpses are too numerous\r\nto elicit even an exclamation.\r\n\r\nAt Mirzapore I engaged a boat to carry me down the river to\r\nBhagulpore, whence I was to proceed to the Sikkim-Himalaya.\r\nThe vessel, which, though slow and very shabby, had the advantage of\r\nbeing cooler and more commodious than the handsomer craft.\r\nIts appearance was not unlike that of a floating haystack, or\r\nthatched cottage: its length was forty feet, and breadth fifteen, and\r\nit drew a foot and a half of water: the deck, on which a kind of\r\nhouse, neatly framed of matting, was erected, was but a little above\r\nthe water's edge. My portion of this floating residence was lined\r\nwith a kind of reed-work formed of long culms of _Saccharum._\r\nThe crew and captain consisted of six naked Hindoos, one of whom\r\nsteered by the huge rudder, sitting on a bamboo-stage astern; the\r\nothers pulled four oars in the very bows opposite my door, or tracked\r\nthe boat along the riverbank.\r\n\r\nIn my room (for cabin I cannot call it) stood my palkee, fitted as a\r\nbed, with mosquito curtains; a chair and table. On one side were\r\nplaced all my papers and plants, under arrangement to go home; on the\r\nother, my provisions, rice, sugar, curry-powder, a preserved ham, and\r\ncheese, etc. Around hung telescope, botanical box, dark lantern,\r\nbarometer, and thermometer, etc., etc. Our position was often\r\n_ashore,_ and, Hindoo-like, on the lee-shore, going bump, bump,\r\nbump, so that I could hardly write. I considered myself fortunate in\r\nhaving to take this slow conveyance down, it enabling me to write and\r\narrange all day long.\r\n\r\nI left on the 15th of March, and in the afternoon of the same day\r\npassed Chunar.* [The first station at which Henry Martyn laboured in\r\nIndia.] This is a tabular mass of sandstone, projecting into the\r\nriver, and the eastern termination of the Kymore range. There is not\r\na rock between this and the Himalaya, and barely a stone all the way\r\ndown the Ganges, till the granite and gneiss rocks of the Behar range\r\nare again met with. The current of the Ganges is here very strong,\r\nand its breadth much lessened: the river runs between high banks of\r\nalluvium, containing much kunker. At Benares it expands into a broad\r\nstream, with a current which during the rains is said to flow eight\r\nmiles an hour, when the waters rise 43 feet. The fall hence is 300\r\nfeet to its junction with the Hooghly, viz., one foot to every mile.\r\nMy observations made that from Mirzapore to Benares considerably\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nBenares is the Athens of India. The variety of buildings along the\r\nbank is incredible. There are temples of every shape in all stages of\r\ncompletion and dilapidation, and at all angles of inclination; for\r\nthe banks give way so much that many of these edifices are fearfully\r\nout of the perpendicular.\r\n\r\nThe famed mosque, built by Aurungzebe on the site of a Hindoo temple,\r\nis remarkable for its two octagonal minarets, 232 feet above the\r\nGanges. The view from it over the town, especially of the European\r\nResident's quarter, is fine; but the building itself is deficient in\r\nbeauty or ornament: it commands the muddy river with its thousands of\r\nboats, its waters peopled with swimmers and bathers, who spring in\r\nfrom the many temples, water-terraces, and ghats on the city side:\r\nopposite is a great sandy plain. The town below looks a mass of poor,\r\nsquare, flat-roofed houses, of which 12,000 are brick, and 16,000 mud\r\nand thatch, through the crowd of which, and of small temples, the eye\r\nwanders in vain for some attractive feature or evidence of the\r\nwealth, the devotion, the science, or the grandeur of a city\r\ncelebrated throughout the East for all these attributes. Green\r\nparrots and pigeons people the air.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of an oriental town is always more or less\r\nruinous; and here the eye is fatigued with bricks and crumbling\r\nedifices, and the ear with prayer-bells. The bright meadows and green\r\ntrees which adorn the European Resident's dwelling, some four miles\r\nback from the river, alone relieve the monotony of the scene.\r\nThe streets are so narrow that it is difficult to ride a horse\r\nthrough them; and the houses are often six stories high, with\r\ngalleries crossing above from house to house. These tall, gaunt\r\nedifices sometimes give place to clumps of cottages, and a mass of\r\ndusty ruins, the unsavoury retreats of vermin and filth, where the\r\n_Calotropis arborea_ generally spreads its white branches and\r\nglaucous leaves--a dusty plant. Here, too, enormous spiders' webs\r\nhang from the crumbling walls, choked also with dust, and resembling\r\ncurtains of coarse muslin, being often some yards across, and not\r\narranged in radii and arcs, but spun like weaver's woofs.\r\nPaintings, remarkable only for their hideous proportions and want of\r\nperspective, are daubed in vermilion, ochre, and indigo.\r\nThe elephant, camel, and porpoise of the Ganges, dog, shepherd,\r\npeacock, and horse, are especially frequent, and so is a running\r\npattern of a hand spread open, with a blood-red spot on the palm.\r\nA still less elegant but frequent object is the fuel, which is\r\ncomposed of the manure collected on the roads of the city, moulded\r\ninto flat cakes, and stuck by the women on the walls to dry,\r\nretaining the sign-manual of the artist in the impressed form of her\r\noutspread hand. The cognizance of the Rajah, two fish chained\r\ntogether, appears over the gates of public buildings.\r\n\r\nThe hundreds of temples and shrines throughout the city are its most\r\nremarkable feature: sacred bulls, and lingams of all sizes, strewed\r\nwith flowers and grains of rice meet the eye at every turn; and the\r\ncity's boast is the possession of one million idols, which, of one\r\nkind and another, I can well believe. The great Hindoo festival of\r\nthe _Holi_ was now celebrating, and the city more than\r\nordinarily crowded; throwing red powder (lac and flour), with\r\nrose-water, is the great diversion at a festival more childish by far\r\nthan a carnival.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Mr. Reade (the Commissioner), I obtained\r\nadmission to the Bishishar-Kumardil, the \"holiest of holies.\" It was\r\na small, low, stone building, daubed with red inside, and swarming\r\nwith stone images of Brahminee bulls, and various disgusting emblems.\r\nA fat old Brahmin, naked to the waist, took me in, but allowed no\r\nfollowers; and what with my ignorance of his phraseology, the clang\r\nof bells and din of voices, I gained but little information.\r\nSome fine bells from Nepal were evidently the lion of the temple.\r\nI emerged, adorned with a chaplet of magnolia flowers, and with my\r\nhands full of _Calotropis_ and _Nyctanthes_ blossoms.\r\nIt was a horrid place for noise, smell, and sights. Thence I went to\r\na holy well, rendered sacred because Siva, when stepping from the\r\nHimalaya to Ceylon, accidentally let a medicine chest fall into it.\r\nThe natives frequent it with little basins or baskets of rice, sugar,\r\netc., dropping in a little of each while they mutter prayers.\r\n\r\nIllustration -- EQUATORIAL-SUNDIAL\r\n\r\nThe observatory at Benares, and those at Delhi, Matra on the Jumna,\r\nand Oujein, were built by Jey-Sing, Rajah of Jayanagar, upwards of\r\n200 years ago; his skill in mathematical science was so well known,\r\nthat the Emperor Mahommed Shah employed him to reform the calendar.\r\nMr. Hunter, in the \"Asiatic Researches,\" gives a translation of the\r\nlucubrations of this really enlightened man, as contained in the\r\nintroduction to his own almanac.\r\n\r\nIllustration -- EQUINOCTIAL SUN-DIAL.\r\n\r\nOf the more important instruments I took sketches; No. 1, is the\r\nNaree-wila, or Equatorial dial; No. 2, the Semrat-yunta, or\r\nEquinoctial dial; No. 3, an Equatorial,  probably a Kranti-urit, or\r\nAzimuth circle.* [Hunter, in As Soc. Researches, 177 (Calcutta); Sir\r\nR. Barker in Phil. Trans., lxvii. 608 (1777); J. L. Williams, Phil.\r\nTrans., lxxxiii. 45 (1793).] Jey-Sing's genius and love of science\r\nseem, according to Hunter, to have descended to some of his family,\r\nwho died early in this century, when \"Urania fled before the\r\nbrazen-fronted Mars, and the best of the observatories, that of\r\nOujein, was turned into an arsenal and cannon foundry.\"\r\n\r\nIllustration -- BRASS AZIMUTH CIRCLE\r\n\r\nThe observatory is still the most interesting object in Benares,\r\nthough it is now dirty and ruinous, and the great stone instruments\r\nare rapidly crumbling away. The building is square, with a central\r\ncourt and flat roof, round which the astrolabes, etc. are arranged.\r\nA half naked Astronomer-Royal, with a large sore on his stomach, took\r\nme round--he was a pitiful object, and told me he was very hungry.\r\nThe observatory is nominally supported by the Rajah of Jeypore, who\r\ndoles out a too scanty pittance to his scientific corps.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Mr. Reade drove me to the Sar-nath, a singular\r\nBoodhist temple, a cylindrical mass of brickwork, faced with stone,\r\nthe scrolls on which were very beautiful, and as sharp as if freshly\r\ncut: it is surmounted by a tall dome, and is altogether about seventy\r\nor a hundred feet high. Of the Boodh figures only one remains, the\r\nothers having been used by a recent magistrate of Benares in\r\nrepairing a bridge over the Goomtee! From this place the Boodhist\r\nmonuments, Hindoo temple, Mussulman mosque, and English church, were\r\nall embraced in one _coup d'oeil._ On our return, we drove past\r\nmany enormous mounds of earth and brick-work, the vestiges of Old\r\nBenares, but whether once continued to the present city or not is\r\nunknown. Remains are abundant, eighteen feet below the site of the\r\npresent city.\r\n\r\nBenares is the Mecca of the Hindoos, and the number of pilgrims who\r\nvisit it is incalculable. Casi (its ancient name, signifying\r\nsplendid), is alleged to be no part of this world, which rests on\r\neternity, whereas Benares is perched on a prong of Siva's trident,\r\nand is hence beyond the reach of earthquakes.* [Probably an allusion\r\nto the infrequency of these phenomena in this meridian; they being\r\ncommon both in Eastern Bengal, and in Western India beyond the\r\nGanges.] Originally built of gold, the sins of the inhabitants were\r\npunished by its transmutation into stone, and latterly into mud and\r\nthatch: whoever enters it, and especially visits its principal idol\r\n(Siva fossilised) is secure of heaven.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th I left Benares for Ghazepore, a pretty town situated on\r\nthe north bank of the river, celebrated for its manufacture of\r\nrose-water, the tomb of Lord Cornwallis, and a site of the Company's\r\nstud. The Rose gardens surround the town: they are fields, with low\r\nbushes of the plant grown in rows, red with blossoms in the morning,\r\nall of which are, however, plucked long before midday. The petals are\r\nput into clay stills, with twice their weight of water, and the\r\nproduce exposed to the fresh air, for a night, in open vessels.\r\nThe unskimmed water affords the best, and it is often twice and even\r\noftener distilled; but the fluid deteriorates by too much\r\ndistillation. The Attar is skimmed from the exposed pans, and sells\r\nat 10 pounds the rupee weight, to make which 20,000 flowers are\r\nrequired. It is frequently adulterated with sandal-wood oil.\r\n\r\nLord Cornwallis' mausoleum is a handsome building, modelled by\r\nFlaxman after the Sybil's Temple. The allegorical designs of Hindoos\r\nand sorrowing soldiers with reversed arms, which decorate two sides\r\nof the enclosed tomb, though perhaps as good as can be, are under any\r\ntreatment unclassical and uncouth. The simple laurel and oak-leaf\r\nchaplets on the alternating faces are far more suitable\r\nand suggestive.\r\n\r\n_March_ 21.--I left Ghazepore and dropped down the Ganges; the\r\ngeneral features of which are soon described. A strong current four\r\nor five miles broad, of muddy water, flows between a precipitous bank\r\nof alluvium or sand on one side, and a flat shelving one of sand or\r\nmore rarely mud, on the other. Sand-banks are frequent in the river,\r\nespecially where the great affluents debouche; and there generally\r\nare formed vast expanses of sand, small \"Saharas,\" studded with\r\nstalking pillars of sand, raised seventy or eighty feet high by gusts\r\nof wind, erect, stately, grave-looking columns, all shaft, with\r\nneither basement nor capital, the genii of the \"Arabian Nights.\"\r\nThe river is always dotted with boats of all shapes, mine being\r\nperhaps of the most common description; the great square, Yankee-like\r\nsteamers, towing their accommodation-boats (as the passengers'\r\nfloating hotels are called), are the rarest. Trees are few on the\r\nbanks, except near villages, and there is hardly a palm to be seen\r\nabove Patna. Towns are unfrequent, such as there are being mere\r\ncollections of huts, with the ghat and boats at the bottom of the\r\nbank; and at a respectful distance from the bazaar, stand the neat\r\nbungalows of the European residents, with their smiling gardens,\r\nhedgings and fencings, and loitering servants at the door. A rotting\r\ncharpoy (or bedstead) on the banks is a common sight, the \"_sola\r\nreliquia_\" of some poor Hindoo, who departs this life by the side\r\nof the stream, to which his body is afterwards committed.\r\n\r\nShoals of small goggled-eyed fish are seen, that spring clear out of\r\nthe water; and are preyed upon by terns and other birds; a few\r\ninsects skim the surface; turtle and porpoises tumble along, all\r\nforming a very busy contrast to the lazy alligator, sunning his green\r\nand scaly back near the shore, with his ichthyosaurian snout raised\r\nhigh above the water. Birds are numerous, especially early and late\r\nin the day. Along the silent shore the hungry Pariah dog may be seen\r\ntearing his meal from some stranded corpse, whilst the adjutant-bird,\r\nwith his head sunk on his body and one leg tucked up, patiently\r\nawaits his turn. At night the beautiful Brahminee geese alight, one\r\nby one, and seek total solitude; ever since having disturbed a god in\r\nhis slumbers, these birds are fated to pass the night in single\r\nblessedness. The gulls and terns, again, roost in flocks, as do the\r\nwild geese and pelicans,--the latter, however, not till after making\r\na hearty and very noisy supper. These birds congregate by the sides\r\nof pools, and beat the water with violence, so as to scare the fish,\r\nwhich thus become an easy prey; a fact which was, I believe, first\r\nindicated by Pallas, during his residence on the banks of the Caspian\r\nSea. Shells are scarce, and consist of a few small bivalves; their\r\ncomparative absence is probably due to the paucity of limestone in\r\nthe mountains whence the many feeders flow. The sand is pure white\r\nand small-grained, with fragments of hornblende and mica, the latter\r\nvarying in abundance as a feeder is near or far away. Pink sand* [I\r\nhave seen the same garnet sand covering the bottom of the Himalayan\r\ntorrents, where it is the produce of disintegrated gneiss, and whence\r\nit is transported to the Ganges.] of garnets is very common, and\r\ndeposited in layers interstratified with the white quartz sand.\r\nWorm-marks, ripple-marks, and the footsteps of alligators, birds and\r\nbeasts, abound in the wet sand. The vegetation of the banks consists\r\nof annuals which find no permanent resting-place. Along the sandy\r\nshores the ever-present plants are mostly English, as Dock, a\r\n_Nasturtium, Ranunculus sceleratus, Fumitory, Juncus bufonius,_,\r\nCommon Vervain, _Gnaphalium luteo-album,_ and very frequently\r\n_Veronica Anagallise._ On the alluvium grow the same, mixed with\r\nTamarisk, _Acacia Arabica,_ and a few other bushes.\r\n\r\nWithered grass abounds; and wheat, dhal (_Cajanus_) and gram\r\n(_Cicer arietinum_), _Carthamus,_ vetches, and rice are the\r\nstaple products of the country. Bushes are few, except the\r\nuniversally prevalent Adhatoda and _Calotropis._ Trees, also,\r\nare rare, and of stunted growth; Figs, the _Artocarpus_ and some\r\n_Leguminosa_ prevail most. I saw but two kinds of palm, the\r\nfan-palm, and _Phoenix_: the latter is characteristic of the\r\ndriest locality. Then, for the animal creation, men, women, and\r\nchildren abound, both on the banks, and plying up and down the\r\nGanges. The humped cow (of which the ox is used for draught) is\r\ncommon. Camels I occasionally observed, and more rarely the elephant;\r\nponeys, goats, and dogs muster strong. Porpoises and alligators\r\ninfest the river, even above Benares. Flies and mosquitos are\r\nterrible pests; and so are the odious flying-bugs,* [Large\r\nHemipterlus insects, of the genus _Derecteryx._] which insinuate\r\nthemselves between one's skin and clothes, diffusing a dreadful\r\nodour, which is increased by any attempt to touch or remove them.\r\nIn the evening it was impossible to keep insects out of the boat, or\r\nto hinder their putting the lights out; and of these the most\r\nintolerable was the abovementioned flying-bug. Saucy crickets, too,\r\nswarm, and spring up at one's face, whilst mosquitos maintain a\r\nconstant guerilla warfare, trying to the patience no less than to the\r\nnerves. Thick webs of the gossamer spider float across the river\r\nduring the heat of the day, as coarse as fine thread, and being\r\ninhaled keep tickling the nose and lips.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, the morning commenced with a dust-storm, the horizon was\r\nabout 20 yards off, and ashy white with clouds of sand; the trees\r\nwere scarcely visible, and everything in my boat was covered with a\r\nfine coat of impalpable powder, collected from the boundless alluvial\r\nplains through which the Ganges flows. Trees were scarcely\r\ndiscernible, and so dry was the wind that drops of water vanished\r\nlike magic. Neither ferns, mosses, nor lichens grow along the banks\r\nof the Ganges, they cannot survive the transition from parching like\r\nthis to the three months' floods at midsummer, when the country is\r\nfor miles under water.\r\n\r\n_March_ 23.--Passed the mouth of the Soane, a vast expanse of\r\nsand dotted with droves of camels; and soon after, the wide-spread\r\nspits of sand along the north bank announced the mouth of the Gogra,\r\none of the vastest of the many Himalayan affluents of the Ganges.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of March I reached Dinapore, a large military station,\r\nsufficiently insalubrious, particularly for European troops, the\r\nbarracks being so misplaced that the inmates are suffocated: the\r\nbuildings run east and west instead of north and south, and therefore\r\nlose all the breeze in the hottest weather. From this place I sent\r\nthe boat down to Patna, and proceeded thither by land to the house of\r\nDr. Irvine, an old acquaintance and botanist, from whom I received a\r\nmost kind welcome. On the road, Bengal forms of vegetation, to which\r\nI had been for three months a stranger, reappeared; likewise groves\r\nof fan and toddy palms, which are both very rare higher up the river;\r\nclumps of large bamboo, orange, _Acacia Sissoo, Melia, Guatteria\r\nlongifolia, Spondias mangifera, Odina, Euphorbia pentagona,\r\nneriifolia_ and _trigona,_ were common road-side plants.\r\nIn the gardens, Papaw, _Croton, Jatropha, Buddleia, Cookia,_\r\nLoquat, Litchi, Longan, all kinds of the orange tribe, and the\r\ncocoa-nut, some from their presence, and many from their profusion,\r\nindicated a decided change of climate, a receding from the desert\r\nnorth-west of India, and its dry winds, and an approach to the damper\r\nregions of the many-mouthed Ganges.\r\n\r\nMy main object at Patna being to see the opium Godowns (stores), I\r\nwaited on Dr. Corbett, the Assistant-Agent, who kindly explained\r\neverything to me, and to whose obliging attentions I am much indebted.\r\n\r\nThe E.I. Company grant licences for the cultivation of the poppy, and\r\ncontract for all the produce at certain rates, varying with the\r\nquality. No opium can be grown without this licence, and an advance\r\nequal to about two-thirds of the value of the produce is made to the\r\ngrower. This produce is made over to district collectors, who\r\napproximately fix the worth of the contents of each jar, and forward\r\nit to Patna, where rewards are given for the best samples, and the\r\nworst are condemned without payment; but all is turned to some\r\naccount in the reduction of the drug to a state fit for market.\r\n\r\nThe poppy flowers in the end of January and beginning of February,\r\nand the capsules are sliced in February and March with a little\r\ninstrument like a saw, made of three iron plates with jagged edges,\r\ntied together. The cultivation is very carefully conducted, nor are\r\nthere any very apparent means of improving this branch of commerce\r\nand revenue. During the N.W., or dry winds, the best opium is\r\nprocured, the worst during the moist, or E. and N.E., when the drug\r\nimbibes moisture, and a watery bad solution of opium collects in\r\ncavities of its substance, and is called Passewa, according to the\r\nabsence of which the opium is generally prized.\r\n\r\nAt the end of March the opium jars arrive at the stores by water and\r\nby land, and continue accumulating for some weeks. Every jar is\r\nlabelled and stowed in a proper place, separately tested with extreme\r\naccuracy, and valued. When the whole quantity has been received, the\r\ncontents of all the jars are thrown into great vats, occupying a very\r\nlarge building, whence the mass is distributed, to be made up into\r\nballs for the markets. This operation is carried on in a long paved\r\nroom, where every man is ticketed, and many overseers are stationed\r\nto see that the work is properly conducted. Each workman sits on a\r\nstool, with a double stage and a tray before him. On the top stage is\r\na tin basin, containing opium sufficient for three balls; in the\r\nlower another basin, holding water: in the tray stands a brass\r\nhemispherical cup, in which the ball is worked. To the man's right\r\nhand is another tray, with two compartments, one containing thin\r\npancakes of poppy petals pressed together, the other a cupful of\r\nsticky opium-water, made from refuse opium. The man takes the brass\r\ncup, and places a pancake at the bottom, smears it with opium-water,\r\nand with many plies of the pancakes makes a coat for the opium. Of\r\nthis he takes about one-third of the mass before him, puts it inside\r\nthe petals, and agglutinates many other coats over it: the balls are\r\nthen again weighed, and reduced or increased to a certain weight if\r\nnecessary. At the day's end, each man takes his work to a rack with\r\nnumbered compartments, and deposits it in that which answers to his\r\nown number, thence the balls (each being put in a clay cup) are\r\ncarried to an enormous drying-room, where they are exposed in tiers,\r\nand constantly examined and turned, to prevent their being attacked\r\nby weevils, which are very prevalent during moist winds, little boys\r\ncreeping along the racks all day long for this purpose. When dry, the\r\nballs are packed in two layers of six each in chests, with the\r\nstalks, dried leaves, and capsules of the plant, and sent down to\r\nCalcutta. A little opium is prepared of very fine quality for the\r\nGovernment Hospitals, and some for general sale in India; but the\r\nproportion is trifling, and such is made up into square cakes. A good\r\nworkman will prepare from thirty to fifty balls a day, the total\r\nproduce being 10,000 to 12,000 a day; during one working season\r\n1,353,000 balls are manufactured for the Chinese market alone.\r\n\r\nThe poppy-petal _pancakes,_ each about a foot radius, are made\r\nin the fields by women, by the simple operation of pressing the fresh\r\npetals together. They are brought in large baskets, and purchased at\r\nthe commencement of the season. The liquor with which the pancakes\r\nare agglutinated together by the ball-maker, and worked into the\r\nball, is merely inspissated opium-water, the opium for which is\r\nderived from the condemned opium, (Passewa,) the washing of the\r\nutensils, and of the workmen, every one of whom is nightly laved\r\nbefore he leaves the establishment, and the water is inspissated.\r\nThus not a particle of opium is lost. To encourage the farmers, the\r\nrefuse stalks, leaves, and heads are bought up, to pack the balls\r\nwith; but this is far from an economical plan, for it is difficult to\r\nkeep the refuse from damp and insects.\r\n\r\nA powerful smell of opium pervaded these vast buildings, which Dr.\r\nCorbett* [I am greatly indebted to Mr. Oldfield, the Opium Agent, and\r\nto Dr. Corbett, for a complete set of specimens, implements, and\r\ndrawings, illustrating the cultivation and manufacture of Opium.\r\nThey are exhibited in the Kew Museum of Economic Botany.] assured me\r\ndid not affect himself or the assistants. The men work ten hours a\r\nday, becoming sleepy in the afternoon; but this is only natural in\r\nthe hot season: they are rather liable to eruptive diseases, possibly\r\nengendered by the nature of their occupation.\r\n\r\nEven the best East Indian opium is inferior to the Turkish, and owing\r\nto peculiarities of climate, will probably always be so. It never\r\nyields more than five per cent. of morphia, whence its inferiority,\r\nbut is as good in other respects, and even richer in narcotine.\r\n\r\nThe care and attention devoted to every department of collecting,\r\ntesting, manipulating, and packing, is quite extraordinary; and the\r\nresult has been an impulse to the trade, beyond what was anticipated.\r\nThe natives have been quick at apprehending and supplying the wants\r\nof the market, and now there are more demands for licences to grow\r\nopium than can be granted. All the opium eaten in India is given out\r\nwith a permit to licensed dealers, and the drug is so adulterated\r\nbefore it reaches the retailers in the bazaars, that it does not\r\ncontain one-thirtieth part of the intoxicating power that it did\r\nwhen pure.\r\n\r\nPatna is the stronghold of Mahommedanism, and from its central\r\nposition, its command of the Ganges, and its proximity to Nepal\r\n(which latter has been aptly compared to a drawn dagger, pointed at\r\nthe heart of India), it is an important place. For this reason there\r\nare always a European and several Native Regiments stationed there.\r\nIn the neighbourbood there is little to be seen, and the highly\r\ncultivated flat country is unfavourable to native vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe _mudar_ plant (_Calotropis_) was abundant here, but I\r\nfound that its properties and nomenclature were far from settled\r\npoints. On the banks of the Ganges, the larger, white-flowered,\r\nsub-arboreous species prevailed; in the interior, and along my whole\r\nprevious route, the smaller purple-flowered kind only was seen.\r\nMr. Davis, of Rotas, was in the habit of using the medicine\r\ncopiously, and vouched for the cure of eighty cases, chiefly of\r\nleprosy, by the _white mudar,_ gathered on the Ganges, whilst\r\nthe purple of Rotas and the neighbourhood was quite inert:\r\nDr. Irvine, again, used the purple only, and found the white inert.\r\nThe European and native doctors, who knew the two plants, all gave\r\nthe preference to the white; except Dr. Irvine, whose experience over\r\nvarious parts of India is entitled to great weight.\r\n\r\n_March_ 29.--Dropped down the river, experiencing a succession\r\nof east and north-east winds during the whole remainder of the\r\nvoyage. These winds are very prevalent throughout the month of March,\r\nand they rendered the passage in my sluggish boat sufficiently\r\ntedious. In other respects I had but little bad weather to complain\r\nof: only one shower of rain occurred, and but few storms of thunder\r\nand lightning. The stream is very strong, and its action on the\r\nsand-banks conspicuous. All night I used to hear the falling cliffs\r\nprecipitated with a dull heavy splash into the water,--a pretty\r\nspectacle in the day-time, when the whirling current is seen to carry\r\na cloud of white dust, like smoke, along its course.\r\n\r\nThe Curruckpore hills, the northern boundary of the gneiss and\r\ngranite range of Paras-nath, are seen first in the distance, and then\r\nthrowing out low loosely timbered spurs towards the river; but no\r\nrock or hill comes close to the banks till near Monghyr, where two\r\nislets of rock rise out of the bed of the river. They are of\r\nstratified quartz, dipping, at a high angle, to the south-east; and,\r\nas far as I could observe, quite barren, each crowned with a little\r\ntemple. The swarm of boats from below Patna to this place was\r\nquite incredible.\r\n\r\n_April_ 1.--Arrived at Monghyr, by far the prettiest town I had\r\nseen on the river, backed by a long range of wooded hills,--detached\r\noutliers of which rise in the very town. The banks are steep, and\r\nthey appear more so owing to the fortifications, which are extensive.\r\nA number of large, white, two-storied houses, some very imposing, and\r\nperched on rounded or conical hills, give a European aspect to\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nMonghyr is celebrated for its iron manufactures, especially of\r\nmuskets, in which respect it is the Birmingham of Bengal. Generally\r\nspeaking, these weapons are poor, though stamped with the first\r\nEnglish names. A native workman will, however, if time and sufficient\r\nreward be given, turn out a first rate fowling-piece. The inhabitants\r\nare reported to be sad drunkards, and the abundance of toddy-palms\r\nwas quite remarkable. The latter, (here the _Phoenix sylvestris,)\r\nI never saw wild, but it is considered to be so in N.W. India; it is\r\nstill a doubtful point whether it is the same as the African species.\r\nIn the morning of the following day I went to the hot springs of\r\nSeeta-koond (wells of Seeta), a few miles south of the town.\r\n\r\nIllustration -- MONGHYR ON THE GANGES, WITH THE CURROCKPORE HILLS IN\r\nTHE DISTANCE.\r\n\r\nThe hills are hornstone and quartz, stratified and dipping southerly\r\nwith a very high angle; they are very barren, and evidently identical\r\nwith those on the south bank of the Soane; skirting, in both cases,\r\nthe granite and gneiss range of Paras-nath. The alluvium on the banks\r\nof the Ganges is obviously an aqueous deposit subsequent to the\r\nelevation of these hills, and is perfectly plane up to their bases.\r\nThe river has its course through the alluvium, like the Soane.\r\nThe depth of the former is in many places upwards of 100 feet, and\r\nthe kunker pebbles it contains are often disposed in parallel\r\nundulating bands. It nowhere contains sand pebbles or fossils;\r\nconcretions of lime (kunker) alone interrupting its uniform\r\nconsistence. It attains its greatest thickness in the valleys of the\r\nGanges and the Soane, gradually sloping up to the Himalaya and\r\nCurruckpore hills on either flank. It is, however, well developed on\r\nthe Kymore and Paras-nath hills, 1200 to 1500 feet above the Ganges\r\nvalley, and I have no doubt was deposited in very deep water, when\r\nthe relative positions of these mountains to the Ganges and Soane\r\nvalleys were the same that they are now. Like every other part of the\r\nsurface of India, it has suffered much from denudation, especially on\r\nthe above-named mountains, and around their bases, where various\r\nrocks protrude through it. Along the Ganges again, its surface is an\r\nunbroken level between Chunar and the rocks of Monghyr. The origin of\r\nits component mineral matter must be sought in the denudation of the\r\nHimalayas within a very recent geological period. The contrast\r\nbetween the fertility of the alluvium and the sterility of the\r\nprotruded quartzy rocks is very striking, cultivation running up to\r\nthese fields of stones, and suddenly stopping.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Soorujkoond hot-springs, those of Seetakoond rise in a\r\nplain, and were once covered by a handsome temple. All the water is\r\ncollected in a tank, some yards square, with steps leading down to\r\nit. The water, which is clear and tasteless (temp. 104 degrees), is\r\nso pure as to be exported copiously, and the Monghyr manufactory of\r\nsoda-water presents the anomaly of owing its purity to Seeta's\r\nablutions.\r\n\r\nOn my passage down the river I passed the picturesque rocks of\r\nSultangunj; they are similar to those of Monghyr, but very much\r\nlarger and loftier. One, a round-headed mass, stands on the bank,\r\ncapped with a triple-domed Mahommedan tomb, palms, and figs.\r\nThe other, which is far more striking, rises isolated in the bed of\r\nthe river, and is crowned with a Hindoo temple, its pyramidal cone\r\nsurmounted with a curious pile of weathercocks, and two little\r\nbanners. The current of the Ganges is here very strong, and runs in\r\ndeep black eddies between the rocks.\r\n\r\nThough now perhaps eighty or a hundred yards from the shore, the\r\nislet must have been recently a peninsula, for it retains a portion\r\nof the once connecting bank of alluvium, in the form of a short\r\nflat-topped cliff, about thirty feet above the water. Some curious\r\nlooking sculptures on the rocks are said to represent Naragur (or\r\nVishnu), Suree and Sirooj; but to me they were quite unintelligible.\r\nThe temple is dedicated to Naragur, and inhabited by Fakirs; it is\r\nthe most holy on the Ganges.\r\n\r\n_April_ 5.--I arrived at Bhagulpore, and took up my quarters\r\nwith my friend Dr. Grant, till he should arrange my dawk for Sikkim.\r\n\r\nThe town has been supposed to be the much-sought Palibothra, and a\r\ndirty stream hard by (the Chundum), the Eranoboas; but Mr. Ravenshaw\r\nhas now brought all existing proofs to bear on Patna and the Soane.\r\nIt is, like most hilly places in India, S. of the Himalaya, the seat\r\nof much Jain worship; and the temples on Mount Manden,* [For the\r\nfollowing information about Bhagulpore and its neighbourhood, I am\r\nindebted chiefly to Col. Francklin's essay in the Asiatic Researches;\r\nand the late Major Napleton and Mr. Pontet.] a few miles off, are\r\nsaid to have been 540 in number. At the assumed summer-palaces of the\r\nkings of Palibothra the ground is covered with agates, brought from\r\nthe neighbouring hills, which were, in a rough state, let into the\r\nwalls of the buildings. These agates perfectly resemble the Soane\r\npebbles, and they assist in the identification of these flanking\r\nhills with those of the latter river.\r\n\r\nAgain, near the hills, the features of interest are very numerous.\r\nThe neighbouring mountains of Curruckpore, which are a portion of the\r\nRajmahal and Paras-nath range, are peopled by tribes representing the\r\nearliest races of India, prior to the invasion of young Rama, prince\r\nof Oude, who, according to the legend, spread Brahminism with his\r\nconquests, and won the hand of King Jannuk's daughter, Seeta, by\r\nbending her father's bow. These people are called Coles, a\r\nmiddle-sized, strong, very dark, and black-haired race, with thick\r\nlips: they have no vocation but collecting iron from the soil, which\r\noccurs abundantly in nodules. They eat flesh, whether that of animals\r\nkilled by themselves, or of those which have died a natural death,\r\nand mix with Hindoos, but not with Mussulmen. There are other tribes,\r\nvestiges of the Tamulian race, differing somewhat in their rites from\r\nthese, and approaching, in their habits, more to Hindoos; but all are\r\ntimorous and retiring.\r\n\r\nThe hill-rangers, or Bhagulpore-rangers, are all natives of the\r\nRajmahal hills, and form a local corps maintained by the Company for\r\nthe protection of the district. For many years these people were\r\nengaged in predatory excursions, which, owing to the nature of the\r\ncountry, were checked with great difficulty. The plan was therefore\r\nconceived, by an active magistrate in the district, of embodying a\r\nportion into a military force, for the protection of the country from\r\ninvasions of their own tribes; and this scheme has answered perfectly.\r\n\r\nTo me the most interesting object in Bhagulpore was the Horticultural\r\nGardens, whose origin and flourishing condition are due to the\r\nactivity and enterprise of the late Major Napleton, commander of the\r\nhill-rangers. The site is good, consisting of fifteen acres, that\r\nwere, four years ago, an indigo field, but form now a smiling garden.\r\nAbout fifty men are employed; and the number of seeds and vegetables\r\nannually distributed is very great. Of trees the most conspicuous are\r\nthe tamarind, _Tecoma jasminoides, Erythrina, Adansonia,\r\nBombax,_ teak, banyan, peepul, _Sissoo, Casuarina, Terminalia,\r\nMelia, Bauhinia._ Of introduced species English and Chinese flat\r\npeaches (pruned to the centre to let the sun in), Mangos of various\r\nsorts, _Eugenia Jambos,_ various Anonas, Litchi, Loquat and\r\nLongan, oranges, _Sapodilla_; apple, pear, both succeeding\r\ntolerably; various Cabool and Persian varieties of fruit-trees; figs,\r\ngrapes, guava, apricots, and jujube. The grapes looked extremely\r\nwell, but they require great skill and care in the management.\r\nThey form a long covered walk, with a row of plantains on the W.\r\nside, to diminish the effects of the hot winds, but even with this\r\nscreen, the fruit on that side are inferior to that on the opposite\r\ntrellis. Easterly winds, again, being moist, blight these and other\r\nplants, by favouring the abundant increase of insects, and causing\r\nthe leaves to curl and fall off; and against this evil there is no\r\nremedy. With a clear sky the mischief is not great; under a cloudy\r\none the prevalence of such winds is fatal to the crop. The white ant\r\nsometimes attacks the stems, and is best checked by washing the roots\r\nwith limewater, yellow arsenic, or tobacco-water. Numerous Cerealia,\r\nand the varieties of cotton, sugar-cane, etc. all thrive extremely\r\nwell; so do many of our English vegetables. Cabbages, peas, and beans\r\nare much injured by the caterpillars of a _Pontia,_ like our\r\nEnglish \"White;\" raspberries, currants, and gooseberries will not\r\ngrow at all.\r\n\r\nThe seeds were all deposited in bottles, and hung round the walls of\r\na large airy apartment; and for cleanliness and excellence of kind\r\nthey would bear comparison with the best seedsman's collection in\r\nLondon. Of English garden vegetables, and varieties of the Indian\r\nCerealia, and leguminous plants, Indian corn, millets, rice, etc.,\r\nthe collections for distribution were extensive.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of economic products is not neglected. Excellent\r\ncoffee is grown; and arrow-root, equal to the best West Indian, is\r\nprepared, at 18s. 6d. per bottle of twenty-four ounces, about a\r\nfourth of the price of that article in Calcutta.\r\n\r\nIn most respects the establishment is a model of what such\r\ninstitutions ought to be in India; not only of real practical value,\r\nin affording a good and cheap supply of the best culinary and other\r\nvegetables that the climate can produce, but as showing to what\r\ndepartments efforts are best directed. Such gardens diffuse a taste\r\nfor the most healthy employments, and offer an elegant resource for\r\nthe many unoccupied hours which the Englishman in India finds upon\r\nhis hands. They are also schools of gardening; and a simple\r\ninspection of what has been done at Bhagulpore is a valuable lesson\r\nto any person about to establish a private garden of his own.\r\n\r\nI often heard complaints made of the seeds distributed from these\r\ngardens not vegetating freely in other parts of India, and it is not\r\nto be expected that they should retain their vitality unimpaired\r\nthrough an Indian rainy season; but on the other hand I almost\r\ninvariably found that the planting and tending had been left to the\r\nuncontrolled management of native gardeners, who with a certain\r\namount of skill in handicraft are, from habits and prejudices,\r\nsingularly unfit for the superintendence of a garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nLeave Bhagulpore -- Kunker -- Colgong -- Himalaya, distant view of --\r\nCosi, mouth of -- Difficult navigation -- Sand storms --\r\nCaragola-Ghat -- Purnea -- Ortolans -- Mahanuddee, transport of\r\npebbles, etc. -- Betel-pepper, cultivation of -- Titalya -- Siligoree\r\n-- View of outer Himalaya -- Terai -- Mechis -- Punkabaree -- Foot of\r\nmountains -- Ascent to Dorjiling -- Cicadas -- Leeches -- Animals --\r\nKursiong, spring vegetation of -- Pacheem -- Arrive at Dorjiling --\r\nDorjiling, origin and settlement of -- Grant of land from Rajah --\r\nDr. Campbell appointed superintendent -- Dewan, late and present --\r\nAggressive conduct of the latter -- Increase of the station -- Trade\r\n-- Titalya fair -- Healtby climate for Europeans and children --\r\nInvalids, diseases prejudicial to.\r\n\r\nI took as it were, a new departure, on Saturday, April the 8th, my\r\ndawk being laid on that day from Caragola-Ghat, about thirty miles\r\ndown the river, for the foot of the Himalaya range and Dorjiling.\r\n\r\nPassing the pretty villa-like houses of the English residents, the\r\nriver-banks re-assumed their wonted features the hills receded from\r\nthe shore; and steep clay cliffs, twenty to fifty feet high, on one\r\nside, opposed long sandy shelves on the other. Kunker was still most\r\nabundant, especially in the lower bed of the banks, close to the (now\r\nvery low) water. The strata containing it were much undulated, but\r\nnot uniformly so; horizontal layers over or under-lying the disturbed\r\nones. At Colgong, conical hills appear, and two remarkable\r\nsister-rocks start out of the river, the same in structure with those\r\nof Sultangunj. A boisterous current swirls round them, strong even at\r\nthis season, and very dangerous in the rains, when the swollen river\r\nis from twenty-eight to forty feet deeper than now. We landed\r\nopposite the rocks, and proceeded to the residence of Mr. G. Barnes,\r\nprettily situated on one of the conical elevations characteristic of\r\nthe geology of the district. The village we passed through had been\r\nrecently destroyed by fire; and nothing but the clay outer walls and\r\ncurious-looking partition walls remained, often white-washed and\r\ndaubed with figures in red of the palm of the hand, elephant,\r\npeacock, and tiger,--a sort of rude fresco-painting. We did not\r\narrive till past mid-day, and the boat, with my palkee and servant,\r\nnot having been able to face the gale, I was detained till the middle\r\nof the following day. Mr. Barnes and his brother proved most\r\nagreeable companions,--very luckily for me, for it requires no\r\nordinary philosophy to bear being storm-stayed on a voyage, with the\r\nprospect of paying a heavy demurrage for detaining the dawk, and the\r\nworse one of finding the bearers given to another traveller when you\r\narrive at the rendezvous. The view from Mr. Barnes' house is very\r\nfine: it commands the river and its rocks; the Rajmahal hills to the\r\neast and south; broad acres of indigo and other crops below; long\r\nlines of palm-trees, and groves of mango, banana, tamarind, and other\r\ntropical trees, scattered close around and in the distance. In the\r\nrainy season, and immediately after, the snowy Himalaya are\r\ndistinctly seen on the horizon, fully 170 miles off. Nearly opposite,\r\nthe Cosi river enters the Ganges, bearing (considering its short\r\ncourse) an enormous volume of water, comprising the drainage of the\r\nwhole Himalaya between the two giant peaks of Kinchinjunga in Sikkim,\r\nand Gossain-Than in Nepal. Even at this season, looking from Mr.\r\nBarnes' eyrie over the bed of the Ganges, the enormous expanses of\r\nsand, the numerous shifting islets, and the long spits of mud betray\r\nthe proximity of some very restless and resistless power. During the\r\nrains, the scene must indeed be extraordinary, when the Cosi lays\r\nmany miles of land under water, and pours so vast a quantity of\r\ndetritus into the bed of the Ganges that long islets are heaped up\r\nand swept away in a few hours; and the latter river becomes all but\r\nunnavigable. Boats are caught in whirlpools, formed without a\r\nmoment's warning, and sunk ere they have spun round thrice in the\r\neddies; and no part of the inland navigation of India is so dreaded\r\nor dangerous, as the Ganges at its junction with the Cosi.\r\n\r\nRain generally falls in partial showers at this season, and they are\r\nessential to the well-being of the spring crops of indigo. The stormy\r\nappearance of the sky, though it proved fallacious, was hailed by my\r\nhosts as predicting a fall, which was much wanted. The wind however\r\nseemed but to aggravate the drought, by the great body of sand it\r\nlifted and swept up the valleys, obscuring the near horizon, and\r\nespecially concealing the whole delta of the Cosi, where the clouds\r\nwere so vast and dense, and ascended so high as to resemble\r\nanother element.\r\n\r\nAll night the gale blew on, accompanied with much thunder and\r\nlightning, and it was not till noon of the 9th that I descried my\r\npalkee-boat toiling down the stream. Then I again embarked, taking\r\nthe lagging boat in tow of my own. Passing the mouths of the Cosi,\r\nthe gale and currents were so adverse that we had to bring up on the\r\nsand, when the quantity which drifted into the boat rendered the\r\ndelay as disagreeable as it was tedious. The particles penetrated\r\neverywhere, up my nose and down my back, drying my eyelids, and\r\ngritting between my teeth. The craft kept bumping on the banks, and\r\nbeing both crazy and leaky, the little comfortless cabin became the\r\nrefuge of scared rats and cockroaches. In the evening I shared a meal\r\nwith these creatures, on some provisions my kind friends had put into\r\nthe boat, but the food was so sandy that I had to bolt my supper!\r\n\r\nAt night the storm lulled a little, and I proceeded to Caragola Ghat\r\nand took up my dawk, which had been twenty-eight hours expecting me,\r\nand was waiting, in despair of my arrival, for another traveller on\r\nthe opposite bank, who however could not cross the river.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished thirty miles, I halted at 9 a..m. on the\r\nfollowing morning at Purnea, quitting it at noon for Kishengunj.\r\nThe whole country wore a greener garb than I had seen anywhere south\r\nof the Ganges: the climate was evidently more humid, and had been\r\ngradually becoming so from Mirzapore. The first decided change was a\r\nfew miles below the Soane mouth, at Dinapore and Patna; and the few\r\nhygrometrical observations I took at Bhagulpore confirmed the\r\nincrease of moisture. The proximity to the sea and great Delta of the\r\nGanges sufficiently accounts for this; as does the approach to the\r\nhills for the still greater dampness and brighter verdure of Purnea.\r\nI was glad to feel myself within the influence of the long-looked-for\r\nHimalaya; and I narrowly watched every change in the character of the\r\nvegetation. A fern, growing by the roadside, was the first and most\r\ntangible evidence of this; together with the rarity or total absence\r\nof _Butea, Boswellia, Catechu, Grislea, Carissa,_ and all the\r\ncompanions of my former excursion.\r\n\r\nPurnea is a large station, and considered very unhealthy during and\r\nafter the rains. From it the road passed through some pretty lanes,\r\nwith groves of planted Guava and a rattan palm (_Calamus_), the first\r\nI had seen. Though no hills are nearer than the Himalaya, from the\r\nconstant alteration of the river-beds, the road undulates remarkably\r\nfor this part of India, and a jungly vegetation ensues, consisting of\r\nthe above plants, with the yellow-flowered Cactus replacing the\r\nEuphorbias, which were previously much more common. Though still 100\r\nmiles distant from the hills, mosses appeared on the banks, and more\r\nferns were just sprouting above ground.\r\n\r\nThe Bamboo was a very different species from any I had hitherto met\r\nwith, forming groves of straight trees fifteen to twenty feet high,\r\nthin of foliage, and not unlike poplars.\r\n\r\nThirty-six miles from Purnea brought me to Kishengunj, when I found\r\nthat no arrangements whatever had been made for my dawk, and I was\r\nfairly stranded. Luckily a thoughtful friend had provided me with\r\nletters to the scattered residents along the road, and I proceeded\r\nwith one to Mr. Perry, the assistant magistrate of the district,--a\r\ngentleman well known for his urbanity, and the many aids he affords\r\nto travellers on this neglected line of road. Owing to this being\r\nsome festival or holiday, it was impossible to get palkee-bearers;\r\nthe natives were busy catching fish in all the muddy pools around.\r\nSome of Mr. Perry's own family also were about to proceed to\r\nDorjiling, so that I had only to take patience, and be thankful for\r\nhaving to exercise it in such pleasant quarters. The Mahanuddee, a\r\nlarge stream from the hills, flows near this place, strewing the\r\nsurrounding neighbourhood with sand, and from the frequent\r\nalterations in its course, causing endless disputes amongst the\r\nlandholders. A kind of lark called an Ortolan was abundant: this is\r\nnot, however, the European delicacy of that name, though a migratory\r\nbird; the flocks are large, and the birds so fat, that they make\r\nexcellent table game. At this time they were rapidly disappearing; to\r\nreturn from the north in September.\r\n\r\nI had just got into bed at night, when the bearers arrived; so\r\nbidding a hurried adieu to my kind host, I proceeded onwards.\r\n\r\n_April_ 12.--I awoke at 4 a.m., and found my palkee on the ground,\r\nand the bearers coolly smoking their hookahs under a tree (it was\r\nraining hard): they had carried me the length of their stage, twelve\r\nmiles, and there were no others to take me on. I had paid twenty-four\r\npounds for my dawk, from Caragola to the hills, to which I had been\r\nobliged to add a handsome douceur; so I lost all patience. After\r\nwaiting and entreating during several hours, I found the head-man of\r\na neighbouring village, and by a further disbursement induced six out\r\nof the twelve bearers to carry the empty palkee, whilst I should walk\r\nto the next stage; or till we should meet some others. They agreed,\r\nand cutting the thick and spongy sheaths of the banana, used them for\r\nshoulder-pads: they also wrapped them round the palkee-poles, to ease\r\ntheir aching clavicles. Walking along I picked up a few plants, and\r\nfourteen miles further on came again to the banks of the Mahanuddee,\r\nwhose bed was strewn with pebbles and small boulders, brought thus\r\nfar from the mountains (about thirty miles distant). Here, again, I\r\nhad to apply to the head-man of a village, and pay for bearers to\r\ntake me to Titalya, the next stage (fourteen miles). Some curious\r\nlong low sheds puzzled me very much, and on examining them they\r\nproved to be for the growth of Pawn or Betel-pepper, another\r\nindication of the moisture of the climate. These sheds are twenty to\r\nfifty yards long, eight or twelve or so broad, and scarcely five\r\nhigh; they are made of bamboo, wattled all round and over the top.\r\nSlender rods are placed a few feet apart, inside, up which the Pepper\r\nVines climb, and quickly fill the place with their deep green glossy\r\nfoliage. The native enters every morning by a little door, and\r\ncarefully cleans the plants. Constant heat, damp, and moisture,\r\nshelter from solar beams, from scorching heat, and from nocturnal\r\nradiation, are thus all procured for the plant, which would certainly\r\nnot live twenty-four hours, if exposed to the climate of this\r\ntreeless district. Great attention is paid to the cultivation, which\r\nis very profitable. Snakes frequently take up their quarters in these\r\nhot-houses, and cause fatal accidents.\r\n\r\nTitalya was once a military station of some importance, and from its\r\nproximity to the hills has been selected by Dr. Campbell (the\r\nSuperintendent of Dorjiling) as the site for an annual fair, to which\r\nthe mountain tribes resort, as well as the people of the plains. The\r\nCalcutta road to Dorjiling by Dinajpore meets, near here, that by\r\nwhich I had come; and I found no difficulty in procuring bearers to\r\nproceed to Siligoree, where I arrived at 6 a.m. on the 13th.\r\nHitherto I bad not seen the mountains, so uniformly had they been\r\nshrouded by dense wreaths of vapour: here, however, when within eight\r\nmiles of their base, I caught a first glimpse of the outer\r\nrange--sombre masses, of far from picturesque outline, clothed\r\neverywhere with a dusky forest.\r\n\r\nSiligoree stands on the verge of the Terai, that low malarious belt\r\nwhich skirts the base of the Himalaya, from the Sutlej to\r\nBrahma-koond in Upper Assam. Every feature, botanical, geological,\r\nand zoological, is new on entering this district. The change is\r\nsudden and immediate: sea and shore are hardly more conspicuously\r\ndifferent, nor from the edge of the Terai to the limit of perpetual\r\nsnow is any botanical region more clearly marked than this, which is\r\nthe commencement of Himalayan vegetation. A sudden descent leads to\r\nthe Mahanuddee river, flowing in a shallow valley, over a pebbly\r\nbottom: it is a rapid river, even at this season; its banks are\r\nfringed with bushes, and it is as clear and sparkling as a trout\r\nstream in Scotland. Beyond it the road winds through a thick\r\nbrushwood, choked with long grasses, and with but few trees, chiefly\r\nof _Acacia, Dalbergia Sissoo,_ and a scarlet fruited _Sterculia._\r\nThe soil is a red, friable clay and gravel. At this season only a few\r\nspring plants were in flower, amongst which a very sweet-scented\r\n_Crinum,_ Asphodel, and a small _Curcuma,_ were in the greatest\r\nprofusion. Leaves of terrestrial Orchids appeared, with ferns and\r\nweeds of hot damp regions. I crossed the beds of many small streams:\r\nsome were dry, and all very tortuous; their banks were richly clothed\r\nwith brushwood and climbers of Convolvulus, Vines, _Hiraea, Leea,\r\nMenispermeae, Cucurbitaceae,_ and _Bignoniaceae._ Their pent-up\r\nwaters, percolating the gravel beds, and partly carried off by\r\nevaporation through the stratum of ever-increasing vegetable mould,\r\nmust be one main agent in the production of the malarious vapours of\r\nthis pestilential region. Add to this, the detention of the same\r\namongst the jungly herbage, the amount of vapour in the humid\r\natmosphere above, checking the upward passage of that from the soil,\r\nthe sheltered nature of the locality at the immediate base of lofty\r\nmountains; and there appear to me to be here all necessary elements,\r\nwhich, combined, will produce stagnation and deterioration in an\r\natmosphere loaded with vapour. Fatal as this district is, and\r\nespecially to Europeans, a race inhabit it with impunity, who, if not\r\nnumerous, do not owe their paucity to any climatic causes. These are\r\nthe Mechis, often described as a squalid, unhealthy people, typical\r\nof the region they frequent; but who are, in reality, more robust\r\nthan the Europeans in India, and whose disagreeably sallow complexion\r\nis deceptive as indicating a sickly constitution. They are a mild,\r\ninoffensive people, industrious for Orientals, living by annually\r\nburning the Terai jungle and cultivating the cleared spots; and,\r\nthough so sequestered and isolated, they rather court than avoid\r\nintercourse with those whites whom they know to be kindly disposed.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding some six miles along the gradually ascending path, I\r\ncame to a considerable stream, cutting its way through stratified\r\ngravel, with cliffs on each side fifteen to twenty feet high, here\r\nand there covered with ferns, the little _Oxalis sensitiva,_ and\r\nother herbs. The road here suddenly ascends a steep gravelly hill,\r\nand opens out on a short flat, or spur, from which the Himalaya rise\r\nabruptly, clothed with forest from the base: the little bungalow of\r\nPunkabaree, my immediate destination, nestled in the woods, crowning\r\na lateral knoll, above which, to east and west, as far as the eye\r\ncould reach, were range after range of wooded mountains, 6000 to 8000\r\nfeet high. I here met with the India-rubber tree (_Ficus elastica_);\r\nit abounds in Assam, but this is its western limit.\r\n\r\nFrom this steppe, the ascent to Punkabaree is sudden and steep, and\r\naccompanied with a change in soil and vegetation. The mica slate and\r\nclay slate protrude everywhere, the former full of garnets. A giant\r\nforest replaces the stunted and bushy timber of the Terai Proper; of\r\nwhich the _Duabanga_ and _Terminalias_ form the prevailing trees,\r\nwith _Cedrela_ and the _Gordonia Wallichii._ Smaller timber and\r\nshrubs are innumerable; a succulent character pervades the bushes and\r\nherbs, occasioned by the prevalence of _Urticeae._ Large bamboos\r\nrather crest the hills than court the deeper shade, and of the latter\r\nthere is abundance, for the torrents cut a straight, deep, and steep\r\ncourse down the hill flanks: the galleys they traverse are choked\r\nwith vegetation and bridged by fallen trees, whose trunks are richly\r\nclothed with _Dendrobium Pierardi_ and other epiphytical Orchids,\r\nwith pendulous _Lycopodia_ and many ferns, _Hoya, Scitamineae,_ and\r\nsimilar types of the hottest and dampest climates.\r\n\r\nThe bungalow at Punkabaree was good--which was well, as my\r\nluggage-bearers were not come up, and there were no signs of them\r\nalong the Terai road, which I saw winding below me. My scanty stock\r\nof paper being full of plants, I was reduced to the strait of\r\nbotanising, and throwing away my specimens. The forest was truly\r\nmagnificent along the steep mountain sides. The apparently large\r\nproportion of deciduous trees was far more considerable than I had\r\nexpected; partly, probably, due to the abundance of the _Dillenia,\r\nCassia,_ and _Sterculia,_ whose copious fruit was all the more\r\nconspicuous from the leafless condition of the plant. The white or\r\nlilac blossoms of the convolvuluslike _Thunbergia,_ and other\r\n_Acanthaceae_ were the predominant features of the shrubby\r\nvegetation, and very handsome.\r\n\r\nAll around, the hills rise steeply five or six thousand feet, clothed\r\nin a dense deep-green dripping forest. Torrents rush down the slopes,\r\ntheir position indicated by the dipping of the forest into their\r\nbeds, or the occasional cloud of spray rising above some more\r\nboisterous part of their course. From the road, at and a little above\r\nPunkabaree, the view is really superb, and very instructive.\r\nBehind (or north) the Himalaya rise in steep confused masses.\r\nBelow, the hill on which I stood, and the ranges as far as the eye\r\ncan reach east and west, throw spurs on to the plains of India.\r\nThese are very thickly wooded, and enclose broad, dead-flat, hot and\r\ndamp valleys, apparently covered with a dense forest. Secondary spurs\r\nof clay and gravel, like that immediately below Punkabaree, rest on\r\nthe bases of the mountains, and seem to form an intermediate neutral\r\nground between flat and mountainous India. The Terai district forms a\r\nvery irregular belt, scantily clothed, and intersected by innumerable\r\nrivulets from the hills, which unite and divide again on the flat,\r\ntill, emerging from the region of many trees, they enter the plains,\r\nfollowing devious courses, which glisten like silver threads.\r\nThe whole horizon is bounded by the sea-like expanse of the plains,\r\nwhich stretch away into the region of sunshine and fine weather, in\r\none boundless flat.\r\n\r\nIn the distance, the courses of the Teesta and Cosi, the great\r\ndrainers of the snowy Himalayas, and the recipients of innumerable\r\nsmaller rills, are with difficulty traced at this, the dry season.\r\nThe ocean-like appearance of this southern view is even more\r\nconspicuous in the heavens than on the land, the clouds arranging\r\nthemselves after a singularly sea-scape fashion. Endless strata run\r\nin parallel ribbons over the extreme horizon; above these, scattered\r\ncumuli, also in horizontal lines, are dotted against a clear grey\r\nsky, which gradually, as the eye is lifted, passes into a deep\r\ncloudless blue vault, continuously clear to the zenith; there the\r\ncumuli, in white fleecy masses, again appear; till, in the northern\r\ncelestial hemisphere, they thicken and assume the leaden hue of\r\nnimbi, discharging their moisture on the dark forest-clad hills\r\naround. The breezes are south-easterly, bringing that vapour from the\r\nIndian Ocean, which is rarefied and suspended aloft over the heated\r\nplains, but condensed into a drizzle when it strikes the cooler\r\nflanks of the hills, and into heavy rain when it meets their still\r\ncolder summits. Upon what a gigantic scale does nature here operate!\r\nVapours, raised from an ocean whose nearest shore is more than 400\r\nmiles distant, are safely transported without the loss of one drop of\r\nwater, to support the rank luxuriance of this far distant region.\r\nThis and other offices fulfilled, the waste waters are returned, by\r\nthe Cosi and Teesta, to the ocean, and again exhaled, exported,\r\nexpended, re-collected, and returned.\r\n\r\nIllustration -- PUNKABAREE BUNGALOW AND BASE OF THE HIMALAYA.\r\n\r\nThe soil and bushes everywhere swarmed with large and troublesome\r\nants, and enormous earthworms. In the evening, the noise of the great\r\n_Cicadae_ in the trees was almost deafening. They burst suddenly into\r\nfull chorus, with a voice so harshly croaking, so dissonant, and so\r\nunearthly, that in these solitary forests I could not help being\r\nstartled. In general character the note was very similar to that of\r\nother _Cicadae._ They ceased as suddenly as they commenced. On the\r\nfollowing morning my baggage arrived, and, leaving my palkee, I\r\nmounted a pony kindly sent for me by Mr. Hodgson, and commenced a\r\nvery steep ascent of about 3000 feet, winding along the face of a\r\nsteep, richly-wooded valley. The road zigzags extraordinarily in and\r\nout of the innumerable lateral ravines, each with its water course,\r\ndense jungle, and legion of leeches; the bite of these blood-suckers\r\ngives no pain, but is followed by considerable effusion of blood.\r\nThey puncture through thick worsted stockings, and even trousers,\r\nand, when full, roll in the form of a little soft ball into the\r\nbottom of the shoe, where their presence is hardly felt in walking.\r\n\r\nNot only are the roadsides rich in plants, but native paths, cutting\r\noff all the zigzags, run in straight lines up the steepest\r\nhill-faces, and thus double the available means for botanising; and\r\nit is all but impossible to leave the paths of one kind or other,\r\nexcept for a yard or two up the rocky ravines. Elephants, tigers, and\r\noccasionally the rhinoceros, inhabit the foot of these hills, with\r\nwild boars, leopards, etc.; but none are numerous. The elephant's\r\npath is an excellent specimen of engineering--the opposite of the\r\nnative track, for it winds judiciously.\r\n\r\nAt about 1000 feet above Punkabaree, the vegetation is very rich, and\r\nappears all the more so from the many turnings of the road, affording\r\nglorious prospects of the foreshortened tropical forests.\r\nThe prevalent timber is gigantic, and scaled by climbing\r\n_Leguminosae,_ as _Bauhinias_ and _Robinias,_ which sometimes sheath\r\nthe trunks, or span the forest with huge cables, joining tree to\r\ntree. Their trunks are also clothed with parasitical Orchids, and\r\nstill more beautifully with Pothos (_Scindapsus_), Peppers, _Gnetum,_\r\nVines, Convolvulus, and _Bignoniae._ The beauty of the drapery of the\r\nPothos-leaves is pre-eminent, whether for the graceful folds the\r\nfoliage assumes, or for the liveliness of its colour. Of the more\r\nconspicuous smaller trees, the wild banana is the most abundant, its\r\ncrown of very beautiful foliage contrasting with the smaller-leaved\r\nplants amongst which it nestles; next comes a screw-pine (_Pandanus_)\r\nwith a straight stem and a tuft of leaves; each eight or ten feet\r\nlong, waving on all sides. _Araliaceae,_ with smooth or armed slender\r\ntrunks, and _Mappa_-like _Euphorbiaceae,_ spread their long petioles\r\nhorizontally forth, each terminated with an ample leaf some feet in\r\ndiameter. Bamboo abounds everywhere: its dense tufts of culms, 100\r\nfeet and upwards high, are as thick as a man's thigh at the base.\r\nTwenty or thirty, species of ferns (including a tree-fern) were\r\nluxuriant and handsome. Foliaceous lichens and a few mosses appeared\r\nat 2000 feet. Such is the vegetation of the roads through the\r\ntropical forests of the Outer-Himalaya.\r\n\r\nAt about 4000 feet the road crossed a saddle, and ran along the\r\nnarrow crest of a hill, the top of that facing the plains of India,\r\nand over which is the way to the interior ranges, amongst which\r\nDorjiling is placed, still twenty-five miles off. A little below this\r\na great change had taken place in the vegetation, marked, first, by\r\nthe appearance of a very English-looking bramble, which, however, by\r\nway of proving its foreign origin, bore a very good yellow fruit,\r\ncalled here the \"yellow raspberry.\" Scattered oaks, of a noble\r\nspecies, with large lamellated cups and magnificent foliage,\r\nsucceeded; and along the ridge of the mountain to Kursiong (a dawk\r\nbungalow at about 4800 feet), the change in the flora was complete.\r\n\r\nThe spring of this region and elevation most vividly recalled that of\r\nEngland. The oak flowering, the birch bursting into leaf, the violet,\r\n_Chrysosplenium, Stellaria_ and _Arum, Vaccinium,_ wild strawberry,\r\nmaple, geranium, bramble. A colder wind blew here: mosses and lichens\r\ncarpeted the banks and roadsides: the birds and insects were very\r\ndifferent from those below; and everything proclaimed the marked\r\nchange in elevation, and not only in this, but in season, for I had\r\nleft the winter of the tropics and here encountered the spring of the\r\ntemperate zone.\r\n\r\nThe flowers I have mentioned are so notoriously the harbingers of a\r\nEuropean spring that their presence carries one home at once; but, as\r\nspecies, they differ from their European prototypes, and are\r\naccompanied at this elevation (and for 2000 feet higher up) with\r\ntree-fern, Pothos, bananas, palms, figs, pepper, numbers of epiphytal\r\nOrchids, and similar genuine tropical genera. The uniform temperature\r\nand humidity of the region here favour the extension of tropical\r\nplants into a temperate region; exactly as the same conditions cause\r\nsimilar forms to reach higher latitudes in the southern hemisphere\r\n(as in New Zealand, Tasmania, South Chili, etc.) than they do in\r\nthe northern.\r\n\r\nAlong this ridge I met with the first tree-fern. This species seldom\r\nreaches the height of forty feet; the black trunk is but three or\r\nfour in girth, and the feathery crown is ragged in comparison with\r\nthe species of many other countries: it is the _Alsophila gigantea,_\r\nand ascends nearly to 7000 feet elevation.\r\n\r\nKursiong bungalow, where I stopped for a few hours, is superbly\r\nplaced, on a narrow mountain ridge. The west window looks down the\r\nvalley of the Balasun river, the east into that of the Mahanuddee:\r\nboth of these rise from the outer range, and flow in broad, deep, and\r\nsteep valleys (about 4000 feet deep) which give them their respective\r\nnames; and are richly wooded from the Terai to their tops.\r\nTill reaching this spur, I had wound upwards along the western slope\r\nof the Mahanuddee valley. The ascent from the spur at Kursiong, to\r\nthe top of the mountain (on the northern face of which Dorjiling is\r\nsituated), is along the eastern slope of the Balasun.\r\n\r\nFrom Kursiong a very steep zigzag leads up the mountain, through a\r\nmagnificent forest of cbesnut, walnut, oaks, and laurels. It is\r\ndifficult to conceive a grander mass of vegetation: the straight\r\nshafts of the timber-trees shooting aloft, some naked and clean, with\r\ngrey, pale, or brown bark; others literally clothed for yards with a\r\ncontinuous garment of epiphytes, one mass of blossoms, especially the\r\nwhite Orchids _Caelogynes,_ which bloom in a profuse manner,\r\nwhitening their trunks like snow. More bulky trunks were masses of\r\ninterlacing climbers, _Araliaceae, Leguminosae, Vines,_ and\r\n_Menispermeae,_ Hydrangea, and Peppers, enclosing a hollow, once\r\nfilled by the now strangled supporting tree, which had long ago\r\ndecayed away. From the sides and summit of these, supple branches\r\nhung forth, either leafy or naked; the latter resembling cables flung\r\nfrom one tree to another, swinging in the breeze, their rocking\r\nmotion increased by the weight of great bunches of ferns or Orchids,\r\nwhich were perched aloft in the loops. Perpetual moisture nourishes\r\nthis dripping forest: and pendulous mosses and lichens are met with\r\nin profusion.\r\n\r\nTwo thousand feet higher up, near Mahaldiram (whence the last view of\r\nthe plains is gained), European plants appear,--Berberry, _Paris,_\r\netc.; but here, night gathered round, and I had still ten miles to go\r\nto the nearest bungalow, that of Pacheem. The road still led along\r\nthe eastern slope of the Balasun valley, which was exceedingly steep,\r\nand so cut up by ravines, that it winds in and out of gulleys almost\r\nnarrow enough to be jumped across.\r\n\r\nIt was very late before I arrived at Pacheem bungalow, the most\r\nsinister-looking rest-house I ever saw, stuck on a little cleared\r\nspur of the mountain, surrounded by dark forests, overhanging a\r\nprofound valley, and enveloped in mists and rain, and hideous in\r\narchitecture, being a miserable attempt to unite the Swiss cottage\r\nwith the suburban gothic; it combined a maximum of discomfort with a\r\nminimum of good looks or good cheer. I was some time in finding the\r\ndirty housekeeper, in an outhouse hard by, and then in waking him.\r\nAs he led me up the crazy verandah, and into a broad ghostly room,\r\nwithout glass in the windows, or fire, or any one comfort, my mind\r\nrecurred to the stories told of the horrors of the Hartz forest, and\r\nof the benighted traveller's situation therein. Cold sluggish beetles\r\nhung to the damp walls,--and these I immediately secured. After due\r\nexertions and perseverance with the damp wood, a fire smoked lustily,\r\nand, by cajoling the gnome of a housekeeper, I procured the usual\r\nroast fowl and potatos, with the accustomed sauce of a strong smoky\r\nand singed flavour.* [Since writing the above a comfortable house has\r\nbeen erected at Senadah, the name now given to what was called\r\nPacheem Bungalow.]\r\n\r\nPacheem stands at an elevation of nearly 7300 feet, and as I walked\r\nout on the following morning I met with English looking plants in\r\nabundance, but was too early in the season to get aught but the\r\nfoliage of most. _Chryosplenium,_ violet, _Lobelia,_ a small\r\ngeranium, strawberry, five or six kinds of bramble, _Arum, Paris,\r\nConvallaria, Stellaria, Rubia, Vaccinium,_ and various _Gnaphalia._\r\nOf small bushes, cornels, honeysuckles, and the ivy tribe\r\npredominated, with _Symplocos_ and _Skimmia, Eurya,_ bushy brambles,\r\nhaving simple or compound green or beautifully silky foliage;\r\n_Hypericum,_ Berberry, Hydrangea, Wormwood, _Adamia cyanea,\r\nViburnum,_ Elder, dwarf bamboo, etc.\r\n\r\nThe climbing plants were still _Panax_ or _Aralia, Kadsura, Saurauja,\r\nHydrangea,_ Vines, _Smilax, Ampelopsis, Polygona,_ and, most\r\nbeautiful of all, _Stauntonia,_ with pendulous racemes of lilac\r\nblossoms. Epiphytes were rarer, still I found white and purple\r\n_Caeloynes,_ and other Orchids, and a most noble white Rhododendron,\r\nwhose truly enormous and delicious lemon-scented blossoms strewed the\r\nground. The trees were one half oaks, one quarter Magnolias, and\r\nnearly another quarter laurels, amongst which grew Himalayan kinds of\r\nbirch, alder, maple, holly, bird-cherry, common cherry, and apple.\r\nThe absence of _Leguminosae was most remarkable, and the most\r\nprominent botanical feature in the vegetation of this region: it is\r\ntoo high for the tropical tribes of the warmer elevations, too low\r\nfor the Alpines, and probably too moist for those of temperate\r\nregions; cool, equable, humid climates being generally unfavourable\r\nto that order. Clematis was rare, and other _Ranunculaceae_ still\r\nmore so. _Cruciferae_ were absent, and, what was still more\r\nremarkable, I found very few native species of grasses. Both _Poa\r\nannua_ and white Dutch clover flourished where accidentally\r\ndisseminated, but only in artificially cleared spots. Of ferns I\r\ncollected about sixty species, chiefly of temperate genera.\r\nThe supremacy of this temperate region consists in the infinite\r\nnumber of forest trees, in the absence (in the usual proportion, at\r\nany rate) of such common orders as _Compositae, Leguminosae,\r\nCruciferae,_ and _Ranunculaceae,_ and of Grasses amongst\r\nMonocotyledons, and in the predominance of the rarer and more local\r\nfamilies, as those of Rhododendron, Camellia, Magnolia, Ivy, Cornel,\r\nHoneysuckle, Hydrangea, Begonia, and Epiphytic orchids.\r\n\r\nFrom Pacheem, the road runs in a northerly direction to Dorjiling,\r\nstill along the Balasun valley, till the saddle of the great mountain\r\nSinchul is crossed. This is narrow, stretching east and west, and\r\nfrom it a spur projects northwards for five or six miles, amongst the\r\nmany mountains still intervening between it and the snows.\r\nThis saddle (alt. 7400 feet) crossed, one is fairly amongst the\r\nmountains: the plains behind are cut off by it; and in front, the\r\nsnows may be seen when the weather is propitious. The valleys on this\r\nside of the mountain run northwards, and discharge their streams into\r\ngreat rivers, which, coming from the snow, wind amongst the hills,\r\nand debouche into the Teesta, to the east, where it divides Sikkim\r\nfrom Bhotan.\r\n\r\nDorjiling station occupies a narrow ridge, which divides into two\r\nspurs, descending steeply to the bed of the Great Rungeet river, up\r\nwhose course the eye is carried to the base of the great snowy\r\nmountains. The ridge itself is very narrow at the top, along which\r\nmost of the houses are perched, while others occupy positions on its\r\nflanks, where narrow locations on the east, and broader ones on the\r\nwest, are cleared from wood. The valleys on either side are at least\r\n6000 feet deep, forest-clad to the bottom, with very few and small\r\nlevel spots, and no absolute precipice; from their flanks project\r\ninnumerable little spurs, occupied by native clearings.\r\n\r\nMy route lay along the east flank, overhanging the valley of the\r\nRungmo river. Looking east, the amphitheatre of hills from the ridge\r\nI had crossed was very fine; enclosing an area some four miles across\r\nand 4000 feet deep, clothed throughout with an impenetrable, dark\r\nforest: there was not one clear patch except near the very bottom,\r\nwhere were some scattered hamlets of two or three huts each. The rock\r\nis everywhere near the surface, and the road has been formed by\r\nblasting at very many places. A wooded slope descends suddenly from\r\nthe edge of the road, while, on the other hand, a bank rises abruptly\r\nto the top of the ridge, alternately mossy, rocky, and clayey, and\r\npresenting a good geological section, all the way along, of the\r\nnucleus of Dorjiling spur, exposing broken masses of gneiss. As I\r\ndescended, I came upon the upper limit of the chesnut, a tree second\r\nin abundance to the oak; gigantic, tall, and straight in the trunk.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Dorjiling on the 16th of April; a showery, cold month at\r\nthis elevation. I was so fortunate as to find Mr. Charles Barnes\r\n(brother of my friend at Colgong), the sole tenant of a long,\r\ncottage-like building, divided off into pairs of apartments, which\r\nare hired by visitors. It is usual for Europeans to bring a full\r\nestablishment of servants (with bedding, etc.) to such stations, but\r\nI had not done so, having been told that there was a furnished hotel\r\nin Dorjiling; and I was, therefore, not a little indebted to Mr.\r\nBarnes for his kind invitation to join his mess. As he was an active\r\nmountaineer, we enjoyed many excursions together, in the two months\r\nand a half during which we were companions.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell procured me several active native (Lepcha) lads as\r\ncollectors, at wages varying from eight to twenty shillings a month;\r\nthese either accompanied me on my excursions, or went by themselves\r\ninto the jungles to collect plants, which I occupied myself in\r\ndrawing, dissecting, and ticketing: while the preserving of them fell\r\nto the Lepchas, who, after a little training, became, with constant\r\nsuperintendence, good plant-driers. Even at this season (four weeks\r\nbefore the setting in of the rains) the weather was very uncertain,\r\nso that the papers had generally to be dried by the fire.\r\n\r\nThe hill-station or Sanatarium of Dorjiling owes its origin (like\r\nSimla, Mussooree, etc.) to the necessity that exists in India, of\r\nproviding places where the health of Europeans may be recruited by a\r\nmore temperate climate. Sikkim proved an eligible position for such\r\nan establishment, owing to its proximity to Calcutta, which lies but\r\n370 miles to the southward; whereas the north-west stations mentioned\r\nabove are upwards of a thousand miles from that city. Dorjiling ridge\r\nvaries in height from 6500 to 7500 feet above the level of the sea;\r\n8000 feet being the elevation at which the mean temperature most\r\nnearly coincides with that of London, viz., 50 degrees.\r\n\r\nSikkim was, further, the only available spot for a Sanatarium\r\nthroughout the whole range of the Himalaya, east of the extreme\r\nwestern frontier of Nepal; being a protected state, and owing no\r\nallegiance, except to the British government; which, after the Rajah\r\nhad been driven from the country by the Ghorkas, in 1817, replaced\r\nhim on his throne, and guaranteed him the sovereignty. Our main\r\nobject in doing this was to retain Sikkim as a fender between Nepal\r\nand Bhotan: and but for this policy, the aggressive Nepalese would,\r\nlong ere this, have possessed themselves of Sikkim, Bhotan, and the\r\nwhole Himalaya, eastwards to the borders of Burmah.* [Of such being\r\ntheir wish the Nepalese have never made any secret, and they are said\r\nto have asked permission from the British to march an army across\r\nSikkim for the purpose of conquering Bhotan, offering to become more\r\npeaceable neighbours to us than the Bhotanese are. Such they would\r\ndoubtless have proved, but the Nepal frontier is considered broad\r\nenough already.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1817 to 1828 no notice was taken of Sikkim, till a frontier\r\ndispute occurred between the Lepchas and Nepalese, which was referred\r\n(according to the terms of the treaty) to the British Government.\r\nDuring the arrangement of this, Dorjiling was visited by a gentleman\r\nof high scientific attainments, Mr. J. W. Grant, who pointed out its\r\neligibility as a site for a Sanatarium to Lord William Bentinck, then\r\nGovernor-General; dwelling especially upon its climate, proximity to\r\nCalcutta, and accessibility; on its central position between Tibet,\r\nBhotan, Nepal, and British India; and on the good example a\r\npeaceably-conducted and well-governed station would be to our\r\nturbulent neighbours in that quarter. The suggestion was cordially\r\nreceived, and Major Herbert (the late eminent Surveyor-General of\r\nIndia) and Mr. Grant were employed to report further on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe next step taken was that of requesting the Rajah to cede a tract\r\nof country which should include Dorjiling, for an equivalent in money\r\nor land. His first demand was unreasonable; but on further\r\nconsideration he surrendered Dorjiling unconditionally, and a sum of\r\n300 pounds per annum was granted to him as an equivalent for what was\r\nthen a worthless uninhabited mountain. In 1840 Dr. Campbell was\r\nremoved from Nepal as superintendent of the new station, and was\r\nentrusted with the charge of the political relations between the\r\nBritish and Sikkim government.\r\n\r\nOnce established, Dorjiling rapidly increased. Allotments of land\r\nwere purchased by Europeans for building dwelling-houses; barracks\r\nand a bazaar were formed, with accommodation for invalid European\r\nsoldiers; a few official residents, civil and military, formed the\r\nnucleus of a community, which was increased by retired officers and\r\ntheir families, and by temporary visitors in search of health, or the\r\nluxury of a cool climate and active exercise.\r\n\r\nFor the first few years matters went on smoothly with the Rajah,\r\nwhose minister (or Dewan) was upright and intelligent: but the\r\nlatter, on his death, was succeeded by the present Dewan, a Tibetan,\r\nand a relative of the Ranee (or Rajah's wife); a man unsurpassed for\r\ninsolence and avarice, whose aim was to monopolise the trade of the\r\ncountry, and to enrich himself at its expense. Every obstacle was\r\nthrown by him in the way of a good understanding between Sikkim and\r\nthe British government. British subjects were rigorously excluded\r\nfrom Sikkim; every liberal offer for free trade and intercourse was\r\nrejected, generally with insolence; merchandise was taxed, and\r\nnotorious offenders, refugees from the British territories, were\r\nharboured; despatches were detained; and the Vakeels, or Rajah's\r\nrepresentatives, were chosen for their insolence and incapacity.\r\nThe conduct of the Dewan throughout was Indo-Chinese; assuming,\r\ninsolent, aggressive, never perpetrating open violence, but by petty\r\ninsults effectually preventing all good understanding. He was met by\r\nneglect or forbearance on the part of the Calcutta government; and by\r\npatience and passive resistance at Dorjiling. Our inaction and\r\nlong-suffering were taken for weakness, and our concessions for\r\ntimidity. Such has been our policy in China, Siam, and Burmah, and in\r\neach instance the result has been the same. Had it been insisted that\r\nthe terms of the treaty should be strictly kept, and had the first\r\nact of insolence been noticed, we should have maintained the best\r\nrelations with Sikkim, whose people and rulers (with the exception of\r\nthe Dewan and his faction) have proved themselves friendly\r\nthroughout, and most anxious for unrestricted communication.\r\n\r\nThese political matters have not, however, prevented the rapid\r\nincrease of Dorjiling; the progress of which, during the two years I\r\nspent in Sikkim, resembled that of an Australian colony, not only in\r\namount of building, but in the accession of native families from the\r\nsurrounding countries. There were not a hundred inhabitants under\r\nBritish protection when the ground was transferred; there are now\r\nfour thousand. At the former period there was no trade whatever;\r\nthere is now a very considerable one, in musk, salt, gold-dust,\r\nborax, soda, woollen cloths, and especially in poneys, of which the\r\nDewan in one year brought on his own account upwards of 50 into\r\nDorjiling.* [The Tibetan pony, though born and bred 10,000 to 14,000\r\nfeet above the sea, is one of the most active and useful animals in\r\nthe plains of Bengal, powerful and hardy, and when well trained\r\nearly, docile, although by nature vicious and obstinate.] The trade\r\nhas been greatly increased by the annual fair which Dr. Campbell has\r\nestablished at the foot of the hills, to which many thousands of\r\nnatives flock from all quarters, and which exercises a most\r\nbeneficial influence throughout the neighbouring territories.\r\nAt this, prizes (in medals, money, and kind) are given for\r\nagricultural implements and produce, stock, etc., by the originator\r\nand a few friends; a measure attended with eminent success.\r\n\r\nIn estimating in a sanitory point of view the value of any\r\nhealth-station, little reliance can be placed on the general\r\nimpressions of invalids, or even of residents; the opinion of each\r\nvaries with the nature and state of his complaint, if ill, or with\r\nhis idiosyncracy and disposition, if well. I have seen prejudiced\r\ninvalids rapidly recovering, in spite of themselves, and all the\r\nwhile complaining in unmeasured terms of the climate of Dorjiling,\r\nand abusing it as killing them. Others are known who languish under\r\nthe heat of the plains at one season, and the damp at another; and\r\nwho, though sickening and dying under its influence, yet consistently\r\npraise a tropical climate to the last. The opinions of those who\r\nresort to Dorjiling in health, differ equally; those of active minds\r\ninvariably thoroughly enjoy it, while the mere lounger or sportsman\r\nmopes. The statistical tables afford conclusive proofs of the value\r\nof the climate to Europeans suffering from acute diseases, and they\r\nare corroborated by the returns of the medical officer in charge of\r\nthe station. With respect to its suitability to the European\r\nconstitution I feel satisfied, and that much saving of life, health,\r\nand money would be effected were European troops drafted thither on\r\ntheir arrival in Bengal, instead of being stationed in Calcutta,\r\nexposed to disease, and temptation to those vices which prove fatal\r\nto so many hundreds. This, I have been given to understand, was the\r\nview originally taken by the Court of Directors, but it has never\r\nbeen carried out.\r\n\r\nI believe that children's faces afford as good an index as any to the\r\nhealthfulness of a climate, and in no part of the world is there a\r\nmore active, rosy, and bright young community, than at Dorjiling.\r\nIt is incredible what a few weeks of that mountain air does for the\r\nIndia-born children of European parents: they are taken there sickly,\r\npallid or yellow, soft and flabby, to become transformed into models\r\nof rude health and activity.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, disorders to which the climate (in common with\r\nall damp ones) is not at all suited; such are especially dysentery,\r\nbowel complaints, and liver complaints of long standing; which are\r\nnot benefited by a residence on these hills, though how much worse\r\nthey might have become in the plains is not shown. I cannot hear that\r\nthe climate aggravates, but it certainly does not remove them.\r\nWhoever is suffering from the debilitating effects of any of the\r\nmultifarious acute maladies of the plains, finds instant relief, and\r\nacquires a stock of health that enables him to resist fresh attacks,\r\nunder circumstances similar to those which before engendered them.\r\n\r\nNatives of the low country, and especially Bengalees, are far from\r\nenjoying the climate as Europeans do, being liable to sharp attacks\r\nof fever and ague, from which the poorly clad natives are not exempt.\r\nIt is, however, difficult to estimate the effects of exposure upon\r\nthe Bengalees, who sleep on the bare and often damp ground, and\r\nadhere, with characteristic prejudice, to the attire of a torrid\r\nclimate, and to a vegetable diet, under skies to which these are\r\nleast of all adapted.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that Europeans who have resided in the plains\r\ncan, on their first arrival, expose themselves with impunity to the\r\ncold of these elevations; this was shown in the winter of 1848 and\r\n1849, when troops brought up to Dorjiling were cantoned in\r\nnewly-built dwellings, on a high exposed ridge 8000 feet above the\r\nsea, and lay, insufficiently protected, on a floor of loosely laid\r\nplanks, exposed to the cold wind, when the ground without was covered\r\nwith snow. Rheumatisms, sharp febrile attacks, and dysenteries\r\nensued, which were attributed in the public prints to the unhealthy\r\nnature of the climate of Dorjiling.\r\n\r\nThe following summary of hospital admissions affords the best test of\r\nthe healthiness of the climate, embracing, as the period does, the\r\nthree most fatal months to European troops in India. Out of a\r\ndetachment (105 strong) of H.M. 80th Regiment stationed at Dorjiling,\r\nin the seven months from January to July inclusive, there were\r\nsixty-four admissions to the hospital, or, on the average, 4-1/3 per\r\ncent. per month; and only two deaths, both of dysentery. Many of\r\nthese men had suffered frequently in the plains from acute dysentery\r\nand hepatic affections, and many others had aggravated these\r\ncomplaints by excessive drinking, and two were cases of delirium\r\ntremens. During the same period, the number of entries at Calcutta or\r\nDinapore would probably have more than trebled this.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nView from Mr. Hodgson's of range of snowy mountains -- Their extent\r\nand elevation -- Delusive appearance of elevation -- Sinchul, view\r\nfrom and vegetation of -- Chumulari -- Magnolias, white and purple --\r\nRhododendron Dalhousiae, arboreum and argenteum -- Natives of\r\nDorjiling -- Lepchas, origin, tradition of flood, morals, dress,\r\narms, ornaments, diet -- cups, origin and value -- Marriages --\r\nDiseases -- Burial -- Worship and religion -- Bijooas -- Kampa Rong,\r\nor Arratt -- Limboos, origin, habits, language, etc. -- Moormis --\r\nMagras -- Mechis  -- Comparison of customs with those of the natives\r\nof Assam, Khasia, etc.\r\n\r\nThe summer, or rainy season of 1848, was passed at or near Dorjiling,\r\nduring which period I chiefly occupied myself in forming collections,\r\nand in taking meteorological observations. I resided at Mr Hodgson's\r\nfor the greater part of the time, in consequence of his having given\r\nme a hospitable invitation to consider his house my home. The view\r\nfrom his windows is one quite unparalleled for the scenery it\r\nembraces, commanding confessedly the grandest known landscape of\r\nsnowy mountains in the Himalaya, and hence in the world.* [For an\r\naccount of the geography of these regions, and the relation of the\r\nSikkim Himalaya to Tibet, etc., see Appendix.] Kinchinjunga\r\n(forty-five miles distant) is the prominent object, rising 21,000\r\nfeet above the level of the observer out of a sea of intervening\r\nwooded hills; whilst, on a line with its snows, the eye descends\r\nbelow the horizon, to a narrow gulf 7000 feet deep in the mountains,\r\nwhere the Great Rungeet, white with foam, threads a tropical forest\r\nwith a silver line.\r\n\r\nTo the north-west towards Nepal, the snowy peaks of Kubra and Junnoo\r\n(respectively 24,005 feet and 25,312 feet) rise over the shoulder of\r\nSingalelah; whilst eastward the snowy mountains appear to form an\r\nunbroken range, trending north-east to the great mass of Donkia\r\n(23,176 feet) and thence south-east by the fingered peaks of Tunkola\r\nand the silver cone of Chola, (17,320 feet) gradually sinking into\r\nthe Bhotan mountains at Gipmoochi (14,509 feet).\r\n\r\nThe most eloquent descriptions I have read fail to convey to my\r\nmind's eye the forms and colours of snowy mountains, or to my\r\nimagination the sensations and impressions that rivet my attention to\r\nthese sublime phenomena when they are present in reality; and I shall\r\nnot therefore obtrude any attempt of the kind upon my reader.\r\nThe latter has probably seen the Swiss Alps, which, though barely\r\npossessing half the sublimity, extent, or height of the Himalaya, are\r\nyet far more beautiful. In either case he is struck with the\r\nprecision and sharpness of their outlines, and still more with the\r\nwonderful play of colours on their snowy flanks, from the glowing\r\nhues reflected in orange, gold and ruby, from clouds illumined by the\r\nsinking or rising sun, to the ghastly pallor that succeeds with\r\ntwilight, when the red seems to give place to its complementary\r\ncolour green. Such dissolving-views elude all attempts at\r\ndescription, they are far too aerial to be chained to the memory, and\r\nfade from it so fast as to be gazed upon day after day, with\r\nundiminished admiration and pleasure, long after the mountains\r\nthemselves have lost their sublimity and apparent height.\r\n\r\nThe actual extent of the snowy range seen from Mr. Hodgson's windows\r\nis comprised within an arc of 80 degrees (from north 30 degrees west\r\nto north 50 degrees east), or nearly a quarter of the horizon, along\r\nwhich the perpetual snow forms an unbroken girdle or crest of frosted\r\nsilver; and in winter, when the mountains are covered down to 8000\r\nfeet, this white ridge stretches uninterruptedly for more than 160\r\ndegrees. No known view is to be compared with this in extent, when\r\nthe proximity and height of the mountains are considered; for within\r\nthe 80 degrees above mentioned more than twelve peaks rise above\r\n20,000 feet, and there are none below 15,000 feet, while Kinchin is\r\n28,178, and seven others above 22,000. The nearest perpetual snow is\r\non Nursing, a beautifully sharp conical peak 19,139 feet high, and\r\nthirty-two miles distant; the most remote mountain seen is Donkia,\r\n23,176 feet high, and seventy-three miles distant; whilst Kinchin,\r\nwhich forms the principal mass both for height and bulk, is exactly\r\nforty-five miles distant.\r\n\r\nOn first viewing this glorious panorama, the impression produced on\r\nthe imagination by their prodigious elevation is, that the peaks\r\ntower in the air and pierce the clouds, and such are the terms\r\ngenerally used in descriptions of similar alpine scenery; but the\r\nobserver, if he look again, will find that even the most stupendous\r\noccupy a very low position on the horizon, the top of Kinchin itself\r\nmeasuring only 4 degrees 31 minutes above the level of the observer!\r\nDonkia again, which is 23,176 feet above the sea, or about 15,700\r\nabove Mr. Hodgson's, rises only 1 degrees 55 minutes above the\r\nhorizon; an angle which is quite inappreciable to the eye, when\r\nunaided by instruments.* [These are the apparent angles which I took\r\nfrom Mr. Hodgson's house (alt. 7300 feet) with an excellent\r\ntheodolite, no deduction being made for refraction.]\r\n\r\nThis view may be extended a little by ascending Sinchul, which rises\r\na thousand feet above the elevation of Mr. Hodgson's house, and is a\r\nfew miles south-east of Dorjiling: from its summit Chumulari (23,929\r\nfeet) is seen to the north-east, at eighty-four miles distance,\r\nrearing its head as a great rounded mass over the snowy Chola range,\r\nout of which it appears to rise, although in reality lying forty\r\nmiles beyond;--so deceptive is the perspective of snowy mountains.\r\nTo the north-west again, at upwards of 100 miles distance, a\r\nbeautiful group of snowy mountains rises above the black Singalelah\r\nrange, the chief being, perhaps, as high as Kinchinjunga, from which\r\nit is fully eighty miles distant to the westward; and between them no\r\nmountain of considerable altitude intervenes; the Nepalese Himalaya\r\nin that direction sinking remarkably towards the Arun river, which\r\nthere enters Nepal from Tibet.\r\n\r\nThe top of Sinchul is a favourite excursion from Dorjiling, being\r\nvery easy of access, and the path abounding in rare and beautiful\r\nplants, and passing through magnificent forests of oak, magnolia, and\r\nrhododendron; while the summit, besides embracing this splendid view\r\nof the snowy range over the Dorjiling spur in the foreground,\r\ncommands also the plains of India, with the courses of the Teesta,\r\nMahanuddee, Balasun and Mechi rivers. In the months of April and May,\r\nwhen the magnolias and rhododendrons are in blossom, the gorgeous\r\nvegetation is, in some respects, not to be surpassed by anything in\r\nthe tropics; but the effect is much marred by the prevailing gloom of\r\nthe weather. The white-flowered magnolia (_M. excelsa,_ Wall,) forms\r\na predominant tree at 7000 to 8000 feet; and in 1848 it blossomed so\r\nprofusely, that the forests on the broad flanks of Sinchul, and other\r\nmountains of that elevation, appeared as if sprinkled with snow.\r\nThe purple-flowered kind again (_M. Campbellii_) hardly occurs below\r\n8000 feet, and forms an immense, but very ugly, black-barked,\r\nsparingly branched tree, leafless in winter and also during the\r\nflowering season, when it puts forth from the ends of its branches\r\ngreat rose-purple cup-shaped flowers, whose fleshy petals strew the\r\nground. On its branches, and on those of oaks and laurels,\r\n_Rhododendron Dalhousiae_ grows epiphytically, a slender shrub,\r\nbearing from three to six white lemon-scented bells, four and a half\r\ninches long and as many broad, at the end of each branch. In the same\r\nwoods the scarlet rhododendron (_R. arboreum_) is very scarce, and is\r\noutvied by the great _R. argenteum,_ which grows as a tree forty feet\r\nhigh, with magnificent leaves twelve to fifteen inches long, deep\r\ngreen, wrinkled above and silvery below, while the flowers are as\r\nlarge as those of _R. Dalhousiae,_ and grow more in a cluster. I know\r\nnothing of the kind that exceeds in beauty the flowering branch of\r\n_R. argenteum,_ with its wide spreading foliage and glorious mass\r\nof flowers.\r\n\r\nOaks, laurels, maples, birch, chesnut, hydrangea, a species of fig\r\n(which is found on the very summit), and three Chinese and Japanese\r\ngenera, are the principal features of the forest; the common bushes\r\nbeing _Aucuba, Skimmia,_ and the curious _Helwingia,_ which bears\r\nlittle clusters of flowers on the centre of the leaf, like\r\nbutcher's-broom. In spring immense broad-leaved arums spring up, with\r\ngreen or purple-striped hoods, that end in tail-like threads,\r\neighteen inches long, which lie along the ground; and there are\r\nvarious kinds of _Convallaria, Paris, Begonia,_ and other beautiful\r\nflowering herbs. Nearly thirty ferns may be gathered on this\r\nexcursion, including many of great beauty and rarity, but the\r\ntree-fern does not ascend so high. Grasses are very rare in these\r\nwoods, excepting the dwarf bamboo, now cultivated in the open air\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to narrate my different expeditions into Sikkim and\r\nNepal from Dorjiling, I shall give a sketch of the different peoples\r\nand races composing the heterogeneous population of Sikkim and the\r\nneighbouring mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Lepcha is the aboriginal inhabitant of Sikkim, and the prominent\r\ncharacter in Dorjiling, where he undertakes all sorts of out-door\r\nemployment. The race to which he belongs is a very singular one;\r\nmarkedly Mongolian in features, and a good deal too, by imitation, in\r\nhabit; still he differs from his Tibetan prototype, though not so\r\ndecidedly as from the Nepalese and Bhotanese, between whom he is\r\nhemmed into a narrow tract of mountain country, barely 60 miles in\r\nbreadth. The Lepchas possess a tradition of the flood, during which a\r\ncouple escaped to the top of a mountain (Tendong) near Dorjiling.\r\nThe earliest traditions which they have of their history date no\r\nfurther back than some three hundred years, when they describe\r\nthemselves as having been long-haired, half-clad savages. At about\r\nthat period they were visited by Tibetans, who introduced Boodh\r\nworship, the platting of their hair into pig-tails, and very many of\r\ntheir own customs. Their physiognomy is however so Tibetan in its\r\ncharacter, that it cannot be supposed that this was their earliest\r\nintercourse with the trans-nivean races: whether they may have\r\nwandered from beyond the snows before the spread of Boodhism and its\r\ncivilisation, or whether they are a cross between the Tamulian of\r\nIndia and the Tibetan, has not been decided. Their language, though\r\nradically identical with Tibetan, differs from it in many important\r\nparticulars. They, or at least some of their tribes, call themselves\r\nRong, and Arratt, and their country Dijong: they once possessed a\r\ngreat part of East Nepal, as far west as the Tambur river, and at a\r\nstill earlier period they penetrated as far west as the Arun river.\r\n\r\nAn attentive examination of the Lepcha in one respect entirely\r\ncontradicts our preconceived notions of a mountaineer, as he is\r\ntimid, peaceful, and no brawler; qualities which are all the more\r\nremarkable from contrasting so strongly with those of his neighbours\r\nto the east and west: of whom the Ghorkas are brave and warlike to a\r\nproverb, and the Bhotanese quarrelsome, cowardly, and cruel. A group\r\nof Lepchas is exceedingly picturesque. They are of short\r\nstature--four feet eight inches to five feet--rather broad in the\r\nchest, and with muscular arms, but small hands and slender wrists.*\r\n[I have seldom been able to insert my own wrist (which is smaller\r\nthan the average) into the wooden guard which the Lepcha wears on his\r\nleft, as a protection against the bow-string: it is a curved ring of\r\nwood with an opening at one side, through which, by a little\r\nstretching, the wrist is inserted.] The face is broad, flat, and of\r\neminently Tartar character, flat-nosed and oblique-eyed, with no\r\nbeard, and little moustache; the complexion is sallow, or often a\r\nclear olive; the hair is collected into an immense tail, plaited flat\r\nor round. The lower limbs are powerfully developed, befitting genuine\r\nmountaineers: the feet are small. Though never really handsome, and\r\nvery womanish in the cast of countenance, they have invariably a\r\nmild, frank, and even engaging expression, which I have in vain\r\nsought to analyse, and which is perhaps due more to the absence of\r\nanything unpleasing, than to the presence of direct grace or beauty.\r\nIn like manner, the girls are often very engaging to look upon,\r\nthough without one good feature they are all smiles and good-nature;\r\nand the children are frank, lively, laughing urchins. The old women\r\nare thorough hags. Indolence, when left to themselves, is their\r\nbesetting sin; they detest any fixed employment, and their foulness\r\nof person and garments renders them disagreeable inmates: in this\r\nrainy climate they are supportable out of doors. Though fond of\r\nbathing when they come to a stream in hot weather, and expert, even\r\nadmirable swimmers, these people never take to the water for the\r\npurpose of ablution. In disposition they are amiable and obliging,\r\nfrank, humorous, and polite, without the servility of the Hindoos; and\r\ntheir address is free and unrestrained. Their intercourse with one\r\nanother and with Europeans is scrupulously honest; a present is\r\ndivided equally amongst many, without a syllable of discontent or\r\ngrudging look or word: each, on receiving his share, coming up and\r\ngiving the donor a brusque bow and thanks. They have learnt to\r\novercharge already, and use extortion in dealing, as is the custom\r\nwith the people of the plains; but it is clumsily done, and never\r\naccompanied with the grasping air and insufferable whine of the\r\nlatter. They are constantly armed with a long, heavy, straight knife,*\r\n[It is called \"Ban,\" and serves equally for plough, toothpick,\r\ntable-knife, hatchet, hammer, and sword.] but never draw it on one\r\nanother: family and political feuds are alike unheard of amongst them.\r\n\r\nIllustration -- LEPCHA GIRL AND BHOODIST LAMA.\r\n\r\nThe Lepcha is in morals far superior to his Tibet and Bhotan\r\nneighbours, polyandry being unknown, and polygamy rare. This is no\r\ndoubt greatly due to the conventual system not being carried to such\r\nan excess as in Bhotan, where the ties of relationship even\r\nare disregarded.\r\n\r\nLike the New Zealander, Tasmanian, Fuegian, and natives of other\r\nclimates, which, though cold, are moist and equable, the Lepcha's\r\ndress is very scanty, and when we are wearing woollen under-garments\r\nand hose, he is content with one cotton vesture, which is loosely\r\nthrown round the body, leaving one or both arms free; it reaches to\r\nthe knee, and is gathered round the waist: its fabric is close, the\r\nground colour white, ornamented with longitudinal blue stripes, two\r\nor three fingers broad, prettily worked with red and white. When new\r\nand clean, this garb is remarkably handsome and gay, but not showy.\r\nIn cold weather an upper garment with loose sleeves is added. A long\r\nknife, with a common wooden handle, hangs by the side, stuck in a\r\nsheath; he has often also a quiver of poisoned arrows and a bamboo*\r\n[The bamboo, of which the quiver is made, is thin and light: it is\r\nbrought from Assam, and called Tulda, or Dulwa, by the Bengalees.]\r\nbow across his back. On his right wrist is a curious wooden guard for\r\nthe bowstring; and a little pouch, containing aconite poison and a\r\nfew common implements, is suspended to his girdle. A hat he seldom\r\nwears, and when he does, it is often extravagantly broad and\r\nflat-brimmed, with a small hemispherical crown. It is made of leaves\r\nof _Scitamineae,_ between two thin plates of bamboo-work, clumsy and\r\nheavy; this is generally used in the rainy weather, while in the dry\r\na conical one is worn, also of platted slips of bamboo, with broad\r\nflakes of talc between the layers, and a peacock's feather at the\r\nside. The umbrella consists of a large hood, much like the ancient\r\nboat called a coracle, which being placed over the head reaches to\r\nthe thighs behind. It is made of platted bamboo, enclosing broad\r\nleaves of _Phrynium._ A group of Lepchas with these on, running along\r\nin the pelting rain, are very droll figures; they look like snails\r\nwith their shells on their backs. All the Lepchas are fond of\r\nornaments, wearing silver hoops in their ears, necklaces made of\r\ncornelian, amber, and turquoise, brought from Tibet, and pearls and\r\ncorals from the south, with curious silver and golden charm-boxes or\r\namulets attached to their necks or arms. These are of Tibetan\r\nworkmanship, and often of great value: they contain little idols,\r\ncharms and written prayers, or the bones, hair, or nail-parings of a\r\nLama: some are of great beauty, and highly ornamented. In these\r\ndecorations, and in their hair, they take some pride, the ladies\r\nfrequently dressing the latter for the gentlemen: thus one may often\r\nsee, the last thing at night, a damsel of discreet port, demurely go\r\nbehind a young man, unplait his pig-tail, teaze the hair, thin it of\r\nsome of its lively inmates, braid it up for him, and retire.\r\nThe women always wear two braided pig-tails, and it is by this they\r\nare most readily distinguished from their effeminate-looking\r\npartners, who wear only one.* [Ermann (Travels in Siberia, ii. p.\r\n204) mentions the Buraet women as wearing two tails, and fillets with\r\njewels, and the men as having one queue only.] When in full dress,\r\nthe woman's costume is extremely ornamental and picturesque; besides\r\nthe shirt and petticoat she wears a small sleeveless woollen cloak,\r\nof gay pattern, usually covered with crosses, and fastened in front\r\nby a girdle of silver chains. Her neck is loaded with silver chains,\r\namber necklaces, etc., and her head adorned with a coronet of scarlet\r\ncloth, studded with seed-pearls, jewels, glass beads, etc. The common\r\ndress is a long robe of indi, a cloth of coarse silk, spun from the\r\ncocoon of a large caterpillar that is found wild at the foot of the\r\nhills, and is also cultivated: it feeds on many different leaves, Sal\r\n(_Shorea_), castor-oil, etc.\r\n\r\nIn diet, they are gross feeders;* [Dr. Campbell's definition of the\r\nLepcha's _Flora cibaria,_ is, that he eats, or must have eaten,\r\neverything soft enough to chew; for, as he knows whatever is\r\npoisonous, he must have tried all; his knowledge being wholly\r\nempirical.] rice, however, forming their chief sustenance; it is\r\ngrown without irrigation, and produces a large, flat, coarse grain,\r\nwhich becomes gelatinous, and often pink, when cooked. Pork is a\r\nstaple dish: and they also eat elephant, and all kinds of animal\r\nfood. When travelling, they live on whatever they can find, whether\r\nanimal or vegetable. Fern-tops, roots of _Scitamineae,_ and their\r\nflower-buds, various leaves (it is difficult to say what not), and\r\nfungi, are chopped up, fried with a little oil, and eaten.\r\nTheir cooking is coarse and dirty. Salt is costly, but prized; pawn\r\n(Betel pepper) is never eaten. Tobacco they are too poor to buy, and\r\ntoo indolent to grow and cure. Spices, oil, etc. are relished.\r\n\r\nThey drink out of little wooden cups, turned from knots of maple, or\r\nother woods; these are very curious on several accounts; they are\r\nvery pretty, often polished, and mounted with silver. Some are\r\nsupposed to be antidotes against poison, and hence fetch an enormous\r\nprice; they are of a peculiar wood, rarer and paler-coloured. I have\r\npaid a guinea for one such, hardly different from the common sort,\r\nwhich cost but 4d. or 6d. MM. Huc and Gabet graphically allude to\r\nthis circumstance, when wishing to purchase cups at Lhassa, where\r\ntheir price is higher, as they are all imported from the Himalaya.\r\nThe knots from which they are formed, are produced on the roots of\r\noaks, maples, and other mountain forest trees, by a parasitical\r\nplant, known to botanists, as _Balanophora_.\r\n\r\nTheir intoxicating drink, which seems more to excite than to debauch\r\nthe mind, is partially fermented. Murwa grain (_Eleusine Coracana_).\r\nSpirits are rather too strong to be relished raw, and when a glass of\r\nwine is given to one of a party, he sips it, and hands it round to\r\nall the rest. A long bamboo flute, with four or six burnt holes far\r\nbelow the month-hole, is the only musical instrument I have seen in\r\nuse among them. When travelling, and the fatigues of the day are\r\nover, the Lepchas will sit for hours chatting, telling stories,\r\nsinging in a monotonous tone, or blowing this flute. I have often\r\nlistened with real pleasure to the simple music of this rude\r\ninstrument; its low and sweet tones are singularly Aeolian, as are\r\nthe airs usually played, which fall by octaves: it seems to harmonize\r\nwith the solitude of their primaeval forests, and he must have a dull\r\near who cannot draw from it the indication of a contented mind,\r\nwhether he may relish its soft musical notes or not. Though always\r\nequipped for the chase, I fancy the Lepcha is no great sportsman;\r\nthere is little to be pursued in this region, and he is not driven by\r\nnecessity to follow what there is.\r\n\r\nTheir marriages are contracted in childhood, and the wife purchased\r\nby money, or by service rendered to the future father-in-law, the\r\nparties being often united before the woman leaves her parents' roof,\r\nin cases where the payment is not forthcoming, and the bridegroom\r\nprefers giving his and his wife's labour to the father for a stated\r\nperiod in lieu. On the time of service expiring, or the money being\r\npaid up, the marriage is publicly celebrated by feasting and riot.\r\nThe females are generally chaste, and the marriage-tie is strictly\r\nkept, its violation being heavily punished by divorce, beating,\r\nslavery, etc. In cases of intermarriage with foreigners, the children\r\nbelong to the father's country. All the labours of the house, the\r\nfield, and march, devolve on the women and children, or slaves if\r\nthey have them.\r\n\r\nSmall-pox is dreaded, and infected persons often cruelly shunned: a\r\nsuspicion of this or of cholera frequently emptying a village or town\r\nin a night. Vaccination has been introduced by Dr. Pearson, and it is\r\nmuch practised by Dr. Campbell; it being eagerly sought. Cholera is\r\nscarcely known at Dorjiling, and when it has been imported thither\r\nhas never spread. Disease is very rare amongst the Lepchas; and\r\nophthalmic, elephantiasis, and leprosy, the scourges of hot climates,\r\nare rarely known. Goitre prevails,* [May not the use of the head\r\ninstead of the shoulder-strap in carrying loads be a predisposing\r\ncause of goitre, by inducing congestion of the laryngeal vessels?\r\nThe Lepcha is certainly far more free from this disease than any of\r\nthe tribes of E. Nepal I have mixed with, and he is both more idle\r\nand less addicted to the head-strap as a porter. I have seen it to be\r\nalmost universal in some villages of Bhoteeas, where the head-strap\r\nalone is used in carrying in both summer and winter crops; as also\r\namongst the salt-traders, or rather those families who carry the salt\r\nfrom the passes to the Nepalese villages, and who very frequently\r\nhave no shoulder-straps, but invariably head-bands. I am far from\r\nattributing all goitre, even in the mountains, to this practice, but\r\nI think it is proved, that the disease is most prevalent in the\r\nmountainous regions of both the old and new world, and that in these\r\nthe practice of supporting enormous loads by the cervical muscles is\r\nfrequent. It is also found in the Himalayan sheep and goats which\r\naccompany the salt-traders, and whose loads are supported in\r\nascending, by a band passing under the throat.] though not so\r\nconspicuously as amongst. Bhoteeas, Bhotanese, and others. Rheumatism\r\nis frequent, and intermittent fevers, with ague; also violent and\r\noften fatal remittents, almost invariably induced by sleeping in the\r\nhot valleys, especially at the beginning and end of the rains.\r\nThe European complaints of liver and bowel disease are all but\r\nunknown. Death is regarded with horror. The dead are burnt or buried,\r\nsometimes both; much depending on custom and position. Omens are\r\nsought in the entrails of fowls, etc., and other vestiges of their\r\nsavage origin are still preserved, though now gradually disappearing.\r\n\r\nThe Lepchas profess no religion, though acknowledging the existence\r\nof good and bad spirits. To the good they pay no heed; \"Why should\r\nwe?\" they say, \"the good spirits do us no harm; the evil spirits, who\r\ndwell in every rock, grove, and mountain, are constantly at mischief,\r\nand to them we must pray, for they hurt us.\" Every tribe has a\r\npriest-doctor; he neither knows nor attempts to practise the healing\r\nart, but is a pure exorcist; all bodily ailments being deemed the\r\noperations of devils, who are cast out by prayers and invocations.\r\nStill they acknowledge the Lamas to be very holy men, and were the\r\nlatter only moderately active, they would soon convert all the\r\nLepchas. Their priests are called \"Bijooas\": they profess mendicancy,\r\nand seem intermediate between the begging friars of Tibet, whose\r\ndress and attributes they assume, and the exorcists of the aboriginal\r\nLepchas: they sing, dance (masked and draped like harlequins), beg,\r\nbless, curse, and are merry mountebanks; those that affect more of\r\nthe Lama Boodhist carry the \"Mani,\" or revolving praying machine, and\r\nwear rosaries and amulets; others again are all tatters and rags.\r\nThey are often employed to carry messages, and to transact little\r\nknaveries. The natives stand in some awe of them, and being besides\r\nof a generous disposition, keep the wallet of the Bijooa always full.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the prominent features of this people, who inhabit\r\nthe sub-Himalayas, between the Nepalese and Bhotan frontiers, at\r\nelevations of 3000 to 6000 feet. In their relations with us, they are\r\nconspicuous for their honesty, their power as carriers and\r\nmountaineers, and their skill as woodsmen; for they build a\r\nwaterproof house with a thatch of banana leaves in the lower, or of\r\nbamboo in the elevated regions, and equip it with a table and\r\nbedsteads for three persons, in an hour, using no implement but their\r\nheavy knife. Kindness and good humour soon attach them to your person\r\nand service. A gloomy-tempered or morose master they avoid, an unkind\r\none they flee. If they serve a good hills-man like themselves, they\r\nwill follow him with alacrity, sleep on the cold, bleak mountain\r\nexposed to the pitiless rain, without a murmur, lay down the heavy\r\nburden to carry their master over a stream, or give him a helping\r\nhand up a rock or precipice--do anything, in short, but encounter a\r\nfoe, for I believe the Lepcha to be a veritable coward.* [Yet, during\r\nthe Ghorka war, they displayed many instances of courage: when so\r\nhard pressed, however, that there was little choice of evils.] It is\r\nwell, perhaps, he is so: for if a race, numerically so weak, were to\r\nembroil itself by resenting the injuries of the warlike Ghorkas, or\r\ndark Bhotanese, the folly would soon lead to destruction.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Lepchas, it may be worth mentioning that the\r\nnorthern parts of the country, towards the Tibet frontier, are\r\ninhabited by Sikkim Bhoteeas* [Bhote is the general name for Tibet\r\n(not Bhotan), and Kumpa is a large province, or district, in that\r\ncountry. The Bhotanese, natives of Bhotan, or of the Dhurma country,\r\nare called Dhurma people, in allusion to their spiritual chief, the\r\nDhurma Rajah. They are a darker and more powerful race, rude,\r\nturbulent, and Tibetan in language and religion, with the worst\r\nfeatures of those people exaggerated. The various races of Nepal are\r\ntoo numerous to be alluded to here: they are all described in various\r\npapers by Mr. Hodgson, in the \"Journal of the Asiatic Society of\r\nBengal.\" The Dhurma people are numerous at Dorjiling; they are often\r\nrunaways, but invariably prove more industrious settlers than the\r\nLepchas. In the Himalaya the name Bhotan is unknown amongst the\r\nTibetans; it signifies literally (according to Mr. Hodgson) the end\r\nof Bhote, or Tibet, being the eastern extreme of that country.\r\nThe Lepchas designate Bhotan as Ayeu, or Aieu, as do often the\r\nBhotanese themselves. Sikkim, again, is called Lhop, or Lho', by the\r\nLepchas and Bhotanese.] (or Kumpas), a mixed race calling themselves\r\nKumpa Rong, or Kumpa Lepchas; but they are emigrants from Tibet,\r\nhaving come with the first rajah of Sikkim. These people are more\r\nturbulent and bolder than the Lepchas, and retain much of their\r\nTibetan character, and even of that of the very province from which\r\nthey came; which is north-east of Lhassa, and inhabited by robbers.\r\nAll the accounts I have received of it agree with those given by\r\nMM. Huc and Gabet.\r\n\r\nNext to the Lepchas, the most numerous tribe in Sikkim is that of the\r\nLimboos (called \"Chung\" by the Lepchas); they abound also in East\r\nNepal, which they once ruled, inhabiting elevations from 2000 feet to\r\n5000 feet. They are Boodhists, and though not divided into castes,\r\nbelong to several tribes. All consider themselves as the earliest\r\ninhabitants of the Tambur Valley, though they have a tradition of\r\nhaving originally emigrated from Tibet, which their Tartar\r\ncountenance confirms. They are more slender and sinewy than the\r\nLepchas, and neither plait their hair nor wear ornaments; instead of\r\nthe ban they use the Nepal curved knife, called \"cookree,\" while for\r\nthe striped kirtle of the Lepcha are substituted loose cotton\r\ntrousers and a tight jacket; a sash is worn round the middle, and on\r\nthe head a small cotton cap. When they ruled over East Nepal, their\r\nsystem was feudal; and on their uniting against the Nepalese, they\r\nwere with difficulty dislodged from their strongholds. They are said\r\nto be equally brave and cruel in battle, putting the old and weak to\r\nthe sword, carrying the younger to slavery, and killing on the march\r\nsuch captives as are unable to proceed. Many enlist at Dorjiling,\r\nwhich the Lepchas never do; and the rajah of Nepal employs them in\r\nhis army, where, however, they seldom obtain promotion, this being\r\nreserved for soldiers of Hindoo tribes. Latterly Jung Bahadur levied\r\na force of 6000 of them, who were cantoned at Katmandoo, where the\r\ncholera breaking out, carried off some hundreds, causing many\r\nfamilies who dreaded conscription to flock to Dorjiling. Their habits\r\nare so similar to those of the Lepchas, that they constantly\r\nintermarry. They mourn, burn, and bury their dead, raising a mound\r\nover the corpse, erecting a headstone, and surrounding the grave with\r\na little paling of sticks; they then scatter eggs and pebbles over\r\nthe ground. In these offices the Bijooa of the Lepchas is employed,\r\nbut the Limboo has also priests of his own, called \"Phedangbos,\" who\r\nbelong to rather a higher order than the Bijooas. They officiate at\r\nmarriages, when a cock is put into the bridegroom's hands, and a hen\r\ninto those of the bride; the Phedangbo then cuts off the birds'\r\nheads, when the blood is caught on a plantain leaf, and runs into\r\npools from which omens are drawn. At death, guns are fired, to\r\nannounce to the gods the departure of the spirit; of these there are\r\nmany, having one supreme head, and to them offerings and sacrifices\r\nare made. They do not believe in metempsychosis.\r\n\r\nThe Limboo language is totally different from the Lepcha; with less\r\nof the _z_ in it, and more labials and palatals, hence more pleasing.\r\nIts affinities I do not know; it has no peculiar written character,\r\nthe Lepcha or Nagri being used. Dr. Campbell, from whom I have,\r\nderived most of my information respecting these people, was\r\ninformed,* [See \"Dorjiling Guide,\" p. 89. Calcutta, 1845.] on good\r\nauthority, that they had once a written language, now lost; and that\r\nit was compounded from many others by a sage of antiquity. The same\r\nauthority stated that their Lepcha name \"Chung\" is a corruption of\r\nthat of their place of residence; possibly the \"Tsang\" province\r\nof Tibet.\r\n\r\nThe Moormis are the only other native tribe remaining in any numbers\r\nin Sikkim, except the Tibetans of the loftier mountains (whom I shall\r\nmention at a future period), and the Mechis of the pestilential\r\nTerai, the forests of which they never leave. The Moormis are a\r\nscattered people, respecting whom I have no information, except from\r\nthe authority quoted above. They are of Tibetan origin, and called\r\n\"Nishung,\" from being composed of two branches, respectively from the\r\ndistricts of Nimo and Shung, both on the road between Sikkim and\r\nLhassa. They are now most frequent in central and eastern Nepal, and\r\nare a pastoral and agricultural people, inhabiting elevations of 4000\r\nto 6000 feet, and living in stone houses, thatched with grass.\r\nThey are a large, powerful, and active race, grave, very plain in\r\nfeatures, with little hair on the face. Both their language and\r\nreligion are purely Tibetan.\r\n\r\nThe Magras, a tribe now confined to Nepal west of the Arun, are\r\naborigines of Sikkim, whence they were driven by the Lepchas westward\r\ninto the country of the Limboos, and by these latter further west\r\nstill. They are said to have been savages, and not of Tibetan origin,\r\nand are now converted to Hindooism. A somewhat mythical account of a\r\nwild people still inhabiting the Sikkim mountains, will be alluded\r\nto elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe that these mountains do not appear to have\r\nafforded refuge to the Tamulian* [The Tamulians are the Coles,\r\nDangas, etc., of the mountains of Central India and the peninsula,\r\nwho retired to mountain fastnesses, on the invasion of their country\r\nby the Indo-Germanic conquerors, who are now represented by the\r\nHindoos.] aborigines of India proper; all the Himalayan tribes of\r\nSikkim being markedly Mongolian in origin. It does not, however,\r\nfollow that they are all of Tibetan extraction; perhaps, indeed, none\r\nbut the Moormis are so. The Mechi of the Terai is decidedly\r\nIndo-Chinese, and of the same stock as the savage races of Assam, the\r\nnorth-east and east frontier of Bengal, Arracan, Burmah, etc. Both\r\nLepchas and Limboos had, before the introduction of Lama Boodhism\r\nfrom Tibet, many features in common with the natives of Arracan,\r\nespecially in their creed, sacrifices, faith in omens, worship of\r\nmany spirits, absence of idols, and of the doctrine of\r\nmetempsychosis. Some of their customs, too, are the same; the form of\r\ntheir houses and of some of their implements, their striped garments,\r\ntheir constant and, dexterous use of the bamboo for all utensils,\r\ntheir practice of night-attacks in war, of using poisoned arrows only\r\nin the chase, and that of planting \"crow-feet\" of sharp bamboo stakes\r\nalong the paths an enemy is expected to follow. Such are but a few\r\nout of many points of resemblance, most of which struck me when\r\nreading Lieutenant Phayre's account of Arracan,* [\"Journal of the\r\nAsiatic Society of Bengal.\"] and when travelling in the districts of\r\nKhasia and Cachar.\r\n\r\nThe laws affecting the distribution of plants, and the lower animals,\r\nmaterially influence the migrations of man also; and as the botany,\r\nzoology, and climate of the Malayan and Siamese peninsula advance far\r\nwestwards into India, along the foot of the Himalaya, so do also the\r\nvarieties of the human race. These features are most conspicuously\r\ndisplayed in the natives of Assam, on both sides of the Burrampooter,\r\nas far as the great bend of that river, beyond which they gradually\r\ndisappear; and none of the Himalayan tribes east of that point\r\npractise the bloody and brutal rites in war that prevail amongst the\r\nCookies, Khasias, Garrows, and other Indo-Chinese tribes of the\r\nmountain forests of Assam, Eastern Bengal, and the Malay peninsula.\r\n\r\nI have not alluded to that evidence of the extraction of the Sikkim\r\nraces, which is to be derived from their languages, and from which we\r\nmay hope for a clue to their origin; the subject is at present under\r\ndiscussion, and involved in much obscurity.\r\n\r\nThat six or seven different tribes, without any feudal system or\r\ncoercive head, with different languages and customs, should dwell in\r\nclose proximity and in peace and unity, within the confined territory\r\nof Sikkim, even for a limited period, is an anomaly; the more\r\nespecially when it is considered that except for a tincture of the\r\nBoodhist religion among some few of the people, they are all but\r\nsavages, as low in the scale of intellect as the New Zealander or the\r\nTahitian, and beneath those races in ingenuity and skill as\r\ncraftsmen. Wars have been waged amongst them, but they were neither\r\nsanguinary nor destructive, and the fact remains no less remarkable,\r\nthat at the period of our occupying Dorjiling, friendship and\r\nunanimity existed amongst all these tribes; from the Tibetan at\r\n14,000 feet, to the Mechi of the plains; under a sovereign whose\r\ntemporal power was wholly unsupported by even the semblance of arms,\r\nand whose spiritual supremacy was acknowledged by very few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nExcursion from Dorjiling to Great Rungeet -- Zones of vegetation --\r\nTree-ferns -- Palms, upper limit of -- Leebong, tea plantations --\r\nGing -- Boodhist remains -- Tropical vegetation -- Pines -- Lepcha\r\nclearances -- Forest fires -- Boodhist monuments -- Fig -- Cane\r\nbridge and raft over Rungeet -- Sago-palm -- India-rubber -- Yel Pote\r\n-- Butterflies and other insects -- Snakes -- Camp -- Temperature and\r\nhumidity of atmosphere -- Junction of Teesta and Rungeet -- Return to\r\nDorjiling -- Tonglo, excursion to -- Bamboo flowering -- Oaks --\r\nGordonia -- Maize, hermaphrodite flowered -- Figs -- Nettles --\r\nPeepsa -- Simonbong, cultivation at -- European fruits at Dorjiling\r\n-- Plains of India.\r\n\r\n A very favourite and interesting excursion from Dorjiling is to the\r\ncane bridge over the Great Rungeet river, 6000 feet below the\r\nstation. To this an excellent road has been cut, by which the whole\r\ndescent of six miles, as the crow flies, is easily performed on\r\npony-back; the road distance being only eleven miles. The scenery is,\r\nof course, of a totally different description from that of Sinchul,\r\nor even of the foot of the hills, being that of a deep\r\nmountain-valley. I several times made this trip; on the excursion\r\nabout to be described, and in which I was accompanied by Mr. Barnes,\r\nI followed the Great Rungeet to the Teesta, into which it flows.\r\n\r\nIn descending from Dorjiling, the zones of vegetation are well marked\r\nbetween 6000 and 7000 feet by--1. The oak, chesnut, and Magnolias,\r\nthe main features from 7000 to 10,000 feet.--2. Immediately below\r\n6,500 feet, the tree-fern appears (_Alsophila gigantea,_ Wall.), a\r\nwidely-distributed plant, common to the Himalaya, from Nepal eastward\r\nto the Malayan peninsula, Java, and Ceylon.--3. Of palms, a species\r\nof _Calamus,_ and _Plectocomia,_ the \"Rhenoul\" of the Lepchas. The\r\nlatter, though not a very large plant, climbs lofty trees, and\r\nextends about 40 yards through the forest; 6,500 feet is the upper\r\nlimit of palms in the Sikkim Himalaya, the Rhenoul alone attaining\r\nthis elevation.*--4. [Four other _Calami_ range between 1000 and 6000\r\nfeet on the outer hills, some of them being found forty miles distant\r\nfrom the plains of India. The other palms of Sikkim are, \"Simong\"\r\n(_Caryota urens_); it is rare, and ascends to nearly 5000 feet.\r\n_Phoenix_ (probably _P. acaulis,_ Buch.), a small, stemless species,\r\nwhich grows on the driest soil in the deep valleys; it is the\r\n\"Schaap\" of the Lepchas, who eat the young seeds, and use the\r\nfeathery fronds as screens in hunting. _Wallichia oblongifolia,_ the\r\n\"Ooh\" of the Lepchas, who make no use of it; Dr. Campbell and myself,\r\nhowever, found that it is an admirable fodder for horses, who prefer\r\nit to any other green food to be had in these mountains. _Areca\r\ngracilis_ and _Licuala peltata_ are the only other palms in Sikkim;\r\nbut _Cycas pectinata,_ with the India-rubber fig, occurs in the\r\ndeepest and hottest valleys--the western limit of both these\r\ninteresting plants. Of _Pandanus_ there is a graceful species at\r\nelevations of 1000 to 4000 feet (\"Borr,\" Lepcha).] The fourth\r\nstriking feature is a wild plantain, which ascends to nearly the same\r\nelevation (\"Lukhlo,\" Lepcha). This is replaced by another, and rather\r\nlarger species, at lower elevations; both ripen austere and small\r\nfruits, which are full of seeds, and quite uneatable; that commonly\r\ngrown in Sikkim is an introduced stock (nor have the wild species\r\never been cultivated); it is very large, but poor in flavour, and\r\ndoes not bear seeds. The zones of these conspicuous plants are very\r\nclearly defined, and especially if the traveller, standing on one of\r\nthe innumerable spurs which project from the Dorjiling ridge, cast\r\nhis eyes up the gorges of green on either hand.\r\n\r\nAt 1000 feet below Dorjiling a fine wooded spur projects, called\r\nLeebong. This beautiful spot is fully ten degrees warmer than Mr.\r\nHodgson's house, and enjoys considerably more sunshine; peaches and\r\nEnglish fruit-trees flourish extremely well, but do not ripen fruit.\r\nThe tea-plant succeeds here admirably, and might be cultivated to\r\ngreat profit, and be of advantage in furthering a trade with Tibet.\r\nIt has been tried on a large scale by Dr. Campbell at his residence\r\n(alt. 7000 feet), but the frosts and snow of that height injure it,\r\nas do the hailstorms in spring.\r\n\r\nBelow Leebong is the village of Ging, surrounded by steeps,\r\ncultivated with maize, rice, and millet. It is rendered very\r\npicturesque by a long row of tall poles, each bearing a narrow,\r\nvertically elongated banner, covered with Boodhist inscriptions, and\r\nsurmounted by coronet-like ornaments, or spear-heads, rudely cut out\r\nof wood, or formed of basket-work, and adorned with cotton fringe.\r\nGing is peopled by Bhotan emigrants, and when one dies, if his\r\nrelations can afford to pay for them, two additional poles and flags\r\nare set up by the Lamas in honour of his memory, and that of Sunga,\r\nthe third member of the Boodhist Trinity.\r\n\r\nBelow this the _Gordonia_ commences, with _Cedrela toona,_ and\r\nvarious tropical genera, such as abound near Punkabaree. The heat and\r\nhardness of the rocks cause the streams to dry up on these abrupt\r\nhills, especially on the eastern slope, and the water is therefore\r\nconveyed along the sides of the path, in conduits ingeniously made of\r\nbamboo, either split in half, or, what is better, whole, except at\r\nthe septum, which is removed through a lateral hole. The oak and\r\nchesnut of this level (3000 feet), are both different from those\r\nwhich grow above, as are the brambles. The _Arums_ are replaced by\r\n_Caladiums. Tree-ferns cease below 4000 feet, and the large bamboo\r\nabounds.\r\n\r\nAt about 2000 feet, and ten miles distant from Dorjiling, we arrived\r\nat a low, long spur, dipping down to the bed of the Rungeet, at its\r\njunction with the Rungmo. This is close to the boundary of the\r\nBritish ground, and there is a guard-house, and a sepoy or two at it;\r\nhere we halted. It took the Lepchas about twenty minutes to construct\r\na table and two bedsteads within our tent; each was made of four\r\nforked sticks, stuck in the ground, supporting as many side-pieces,\r\nacross which were laid flat split pieces of bamboo, bound tightly\r\ntogether by strips of rattan palm-stem. The beds were afterwards\r\nsoftened by many layers of bamboo-leaf, and if not very downy, they\r\nwere dry, and as firm as if put together with screws and joints.\r\n\r\nThis spur rises out of a deep valley, quite surrounded by lofty\r\nmountains; it is narrow, and covered with red clay, which the natives\r\nchew as a cure for goitre. North, it looks down into a gully, at the\r\nbottom of which the Rungeet's foamy stream winds through a dense\r\nforest. In the opposite direction, the Rungmo comes tearing down from\r\nthe top of Sinchul, 7000 feet above; and though its roar is heard,\r\nand its course is visible throughout its length, the stream itself is\r\nnowhere seen, so deep does it cut its channel. Except on this, and a\r\nfew similarly hard rocky hills around, the vegetation is a mass of\r\nwood and jungle. At this spot it is rather scanty and dry, with\r\nabundance of the _Pinus longifolia_ and Sal. The dwarf date-palm\r\n(_Phoenix acaulis_) also, was very abundant.\r\n\r\nThe descent to the river was exceedingly steep, the banks presenting\r\nan impenetrable jungle. The pines on the arid crests of the hills\r\naround formed a remarkable feature: they grow like the Scotch fir,\r\nthe tall, red trunks springing from the steep and dry slopes. But\r\nlittle resin exudes from the stem, which, like that of most pines, is\r\nsingularly free from lichens and mosses; its wood is excellent, and\r\nthe charcoal of the burnt leaves is used as a pigment. Being confined\r\nto dry soil, this pine is local in Sikkim, and the elevation it\r\nattains here is not above 3000 feet. In Bhotan, where there is more\r\ndry country, its range is about the same, and in the north-west\r\nHimalaya, from 2,500 to 7000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe Lepcha never inhabits one spot for more than three successive\r\nyears, after which an increased rent is demanded by the Rajah. He\r\ntherefore _squats_ in any place which he can render profitable for\r\nthat period, and then moves to another. His first operation, after\r\nselecting a site, is to burn the jungle; then he clears away the\r\ntrees, and cultivates between the stumps. At this season, firing the\r\njungle is a frequent practice, and the effect by night is exceedingly\r\nfine; a forest, so dry and full of bamboo, and extending over such\r\nsteep hills, affording grand blazing spectacles. Heavy clouds canopy\r\nthe mountains above, and, stretching across the valleys, shut out the\r\nfirmament; the air is a dead calm, as usual in these deep gorges, and\r\nthe fires, invisible by day, are seen raging all around, appearing to\r\nan inexperienced eye in all but dangerous proximity. The voices of\r\nbirds and insects being hushed, nothing is audible but the harsh roar\r\nof the rivers, and occasionally, rising far above it, that of the\r\nforest fires. At night we were literally surrounded by them; some\r\nsmouldering, like the shale-heaps at a colliery, others fitfully\r\nbursting forth, whilst others again stalked along with a steadily\r\nincreasing and enlarging flame, shooting out great tongues of fire,\r\nwhich spared nothing as they advanced with irresistible might. Their\r\ntriumph is in reaching a great bamboo clump, when the noise of the\r\nflames drowns that of the torrents, and as the great stem-joints,\r\nburst, from the expansion of the confined air, the report is as that\r\nof a salvo from a park of artillery. At Dorjiling the blaze is\r\nvisible, and the deadened reports of the bamboos bursting is heard\r\nthroughout the night; but in the valley, and within a mile of the\r\nscene of destruction, the effect is the most grand, being heightened\r\nby the glare reflected from the masses of mist which hover above.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we pursued a path to the bed of the river;\r\npassing a rude Booddhist monument, a pile of slate-rocks, with an\r\nattempt at the mystical hemisphere at top. A few flags or banners,\r\nand slabs of slate, were inscribed with \"Om Mani Padmi om.\" Placed on\r\na jutting angle of the spur, backed with the pine-clad hills, and\r\nflanked by a torrent on either hand, the spot was wild and\r\npicturesque; and I could not but gaze with a feeling of deep interest\r\non these emblems of a religion which perhaps numbers more votaries\r\nthan any other on the face of the globe. Booddhism in some form is\r\nthe predominating creed, from Siberia and Kamschatka to Ceylon, from\r\nthe Caspian steppes to Japan, throughout China, Burmah, Ava, and a\r\npart of the Malayan Archipelago. Its associations enter into every\r\nbook of travels over these vast regions, with Booddha, Dhurma, Sunga,\r\nJos, Fo, and praying-wheels. The mind is arrested by the names, the\r\nimagination captivated by the symbols; and though I could not worship\r\nin the grove, it was impossible to deny to the inscribed stones such\r\na tribute as is commanded by the first glimpse of objects which have\r\nlong been familiar to our minds, but not previously offered to our\r\nsenses. My head Lepcha went further: to a due observance of\r\ndemon-worship he united a deep reverence for the Lamas, and he\r\nvenerated their symbols rather as theirs than as those of their\r\nreligion. He walked round the pile of stones three times from left to\r\nright repeating his \"Om Mani,\" etc., then stood before it with his\r\nhead hung down and his long queue streaming behind, and concluded by\r\na votive offering of three pine-cones. When done, he looked round at\r\nme, nodded, smirked, elevated the angles of his little turned-up\r\neyes, and seemed to think we were safe from all perils in the valleys\r\nyet to be explored.\r\n\r\nIllustration -- PINES (PINUS LONGIFOLIA), RUNGEET VALLEY.\r\n\r\nIn the gorge of the Rungeet the heat was intolerable, though the\r\nthermometer did not rise above 95 degrees. The mountains leave but a\r\nnarrow gorge between them, here and there bordered by a belt of\r\nstrong soil, supporting a towering crop of long cane-like grasses and\r\ntall trees. The troubled river, about eighty yards across, rages\r\nalong over a gravelly bed. Crossing the Rungmo, where it falls into\r\nthe Rungeet, we came upon a group of natives drinking fermented Murwa\r\nliquor, under a rock; I had a good deal of difficulty in getting my\r\npeople past, and more in inducing one of the topers to take the place\r\nof a Ghorka (Nepalese) of our party who was ill with fever. Soon\r\nafterwards, at a most wild and beautiful spot, I saw, for the first\r\ntime, one of the most characteristic of Himalayan objects of art, _a\r\ncane bridge._ All the spurs, round the bases of which the river\r\nflowed, were steep and rocky, their flanks clothed with the richest\r\ntropical forest, their crests tipped with pines. On the river's edge,\r\nthe Banana, _Pandanus,_ and _Bauhinia,_ were frequent, and Figs\r\nprevailed. One of the latter (of an exceedingly beautiful species)\r\nprojected over the stream, growing out of a mass of rock, its roots\r\ninterlaced and grasping at every available support, while its\r\nbranches, loaded with deep glossy foliage, hung over the water. This\r\ntree formed one pier for the canes; that on the opposite bank, was\r\nconstructed of strong piles, propped with large stones; and between\r\nthem swung the bridge,* [A sketch of one of these bridges will be\r\nfound in Vol. ii.] about eighty yards long, ever rocking over the\r\ntorrent (forty feet below). The lightness and extreme simplicity of\r\nits structure were very remarkable. Two parallel canes, on the same\r\nhorizontal plane, were stretched across the stream; from them others\r\nhung in loops, and along the loops were laid one or two bamboo stems\r\nfor flooring; cross pieces below this flooring, hung from the two\r\nupper canes, which they thus served to keep apart. The traveller\r\ngrasps one of the canes in either hand, and walks along the loose\r\nbamboos laid on the swinging loops: the motion is great, and the\r\nrattling of the loose dry bamboos is neither a musical sound, nor one\r\ncalculated to inspire confidence; the whole structure seeming as if\r\nabout to break down. With shoes it is not easy to walk; and even with\r\nbare feet it is often difficult, there being frequently but one\r\nbamboo, which, if the fastening is loose, tilts up, leaving the\r\npedestrian suspended over the torrent by the slender canes. When\r\nproperly and strongly made, with good fastenings, and a floor of\r\nbamboos laid _transversely,_ these bridges are easy to cross. The\r\ncanes are procured from a species of _Calamus_; they are as thick as\r\nthe finger, and twenty, or thirty yards long, knotted together; and\r\nthe other pieces are fastened to them by strips of the same plant. A\r\nLepcha, carrying one hundred and forty pounds on his back, crosses\r\nwithout hesitation, slowly but steadily, and with perfect confidence.\r\n\r\nIllustration -- CANE BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nA deep broad pool below the bridge was made available for a ferry:\r\nthe boat was a triangular raft of bamboo stems, with a stage on the\r\ntop, and it was secured on the opposite side of the stream, having a\r\ncane reaching across to that on which we were. A stout Lepcha leapt\r\ninto the boiling flood, and boldly swam across, holding on by the\r\ncane, without which he would have been carried away. He unfastened\r\nthe raft, and we drew it over by the cane, and, seated on the stage,\r\nup to our knees in water, we were pulled across; the raft bobbing up\r\nand down over the rippling stream.\r\n\r\nWe were beyond British ground, on the opposite bank, where any one\r\nguiding Europeans is threatened with punishment: we had expected a\r\nguide to follow us, but his non-appearance caused us to delay for\r\nsome hours; four roads, or rather forest paths, meeting here, all of\r\nwhich were difficult to find. After a while, part of a\r\nmarriage-procession came up, headed by the bridegroom, a handsome\r\nyoung Lepcha, leading a cow for the marriage feast; and after talking\r\nto him a little, he volunteered to show us the path. On the flats by\r\nthe stream grew the Sago palm (_Cycas pectinata_), with a stem ten\r\nfeet high, and a beautiful crown of foliage; the contrast between\r\nthis and the Scotch-looking pine (both growing with oaks and palms)\r\nwas curious. Much of the forest had been burnt, and we traversed\r\nlarge blackened patches, where the heat was intense, and increased by\r\nthe burning trunks of prostrate trees, which smoulder for months, and\r\nleave a heap of white ashes. The larger timber being hollow in the\r\ncentre, a current of air is produced, which causes the interior to\r\nburn rapidly, till the sides fall in, and all is consumed. I was\r\noften startled, when walking in the forest, by the hot blast\r\nproceeding from such, which I had approached without a suspicion of\r\ntheir being other than cold dead trunks.\r\n\r\nLeaving the forest, the path led along the river bank, and over the\r\ngreat masses of rock which strewed its course. The beautiful\r\nIndia-rubber fig was common, as was _Bassia butyracea,_ the \"Yel\r\nPote\" of the Lepchas, from the seeds of which they express a concrete\r\noil, which is received and hardens in bamboo vessels. On the\r\nforest-skirts, _Hoya,_ parasitical _Orchideae,_ and Ferns, abounded;\r\nthe Chaulmoogra, whose fruit is used to intoxicate fish, was very\r\ncommon; as was an immense mulberry tree, that yields a milky juice\r\nand produces a long green sweet fruit. Large fish, chiefly Cyprinoid,\r\nwere abundant in the beautifully clear water of the river. But by far\r\nthe most striking feature consisted in the amazing quantity of superb\r\nbutterflies, large tropical swallow-tails, black, with scarlet or\r\nyellow eyes on their wings. They were seen everywhere, sailing\r\nmajestically through the still hot air, or fluttering from one\r\nscorching rock to another, and especially loving to settle on the\r\ndamp sand of the river-edge; where they sat by thousands, with erect\r\nwings, balancing themselves with a rocking motion, as their heavy\r\nsails inclined them to one side or the other; resembling a crowded\r\nfleet of yachts on a calm day. Such an entomological display cannot\r\nbe surpassed. _Cicindelae_ were very numerous, and incredibly active,\r\nas were _Grylli_; and the great _Cicadeae_ were everywhere lighting\r\non the ground, when they uttered a short sharp creaking sound, and\r\nanon disappeared, as if by magic. Beautiful whip-snakes were gleaming\r\nin the sun: they hold on by a few coils of the tail round a twig, the\r\ngreater part of their body stretched out horizontally, occasionally\r\nretracting, and darting an unerring aim at some insect.\r\nThe narrowness of the gorge, and the excessive steepness of the\r\nbounding hills, prevented any view, except of the opposite mountain\r\nface, which was one dense forest, in which the wild Banana\r\nwas conspicuous.\r\n\r\nTowards evening we arrived at another cane-bridge, still more\r\ndilapidated than the former, but similar in structure. For a few\r\nhundred yards before reaching it, we lost the path, and followed the\r\nprecipitous face of slate-rocks overhanging the stream, which dashed\r\nwith great violence below. Though we could not walk comfortably, even\r\nwith our shoes off, the Lepchas, bearing their enormous loads,\r\nproceeded with perfect indifference.\r\n\r\nAnxious to avoid sleeping at the bottom of the valley, we crawled,\r\nvery much fatigued, through burnt dry forest, up a very sharp ridge,\r\nso narrow that the tent sat astride on it, the ropes being fastened\r\nto the tops of small trees on either slope. The ground swarmed with\r\nblack ants, which got into our tea, sugar, etc., while it was so\r\ncovered with charcoal, that we were soon begrimed. Our Lepchas\r\npreferred remaining on the river-bank, whence they had to bring up\r\nwater to us, in great bamboo \"chungis,\" as they are called. The great\r\ndryness of this face is owing to its southern exposure: the opposite\r\nmountains, equally high and steep, being clothed in a rich green\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nAt nine the next morning, the temperature was 78 degrees, but a fine\r\ncool easterly wind blew. Descending to the bed of the river, the\r\ntemperature was 84 degrees. The difference in humidity of the two\r\nstations (with about 300 feet difference in height) was more\r\nremarkable; at the upper, the wet bulb thermometer was 67.5 degrees,\r\nand consequently the saturation point, 0.713; at the lower, the wet\r\nbulb was 68 degrees, and saturation, 0.599. The temperature of the\r\nriver was, at all hours of the preceding day, and this morning, 67.5\r\ndegrees.* [At this hour, the probable temperature at Dorjiling (6000\r\nfeet above this) would be 56 degrees, with a temperature of wet bulb\r\n55 degrees, and the atmosphere loaded with vapour. At Calcutta,\r\nagain, the temperature was at the observatory 98.3 degrees, wet bulb,\r\n81.8 degrees, and saturation=0.137. The dryness of the air, in the\r\ndamper-looking and luxuriant river-bed, was owing to the heated rocks\r\nof its channel; while the humidity of the atmosphere over the\r\ndrier-looking hill where we encamped, was due to the moisture of the\r\nwind then blowing.]\r\n\r\nOur course down the river was by so rugged a path, that, giddy and\r\nfootsore with leaping from rock to rock, we at last attempted the\r\njungle, but it proved utterly impervious. On turning a bend of the\r\nstream, the mountains of Bhotan suddenly presented themselves, with\r\nthe Teesta flowing at their base; and we emerged at the angle formed\r\nby the junction of the Rungeet, which we had followed from the west,\r\nof the Teesta, coming from the north, and of their united streams\r\nflowing south.\r\n\r\nWe were not long before enjoying the water, when I was surprised to\r\nfind that of the Teesta singularly cold; its temperature being 7\r\ndegrees below that of the Rungeet.* [This is, no doubt, due partly to\r\nthe Teesta flowing south, and thus having less of the sun, and partly\r\nto its draining snowy mountains throughout a much longer portion of\r\nits course. The temperature of the one was 67.5 degrees, and that of\r\nthe other 60.5 degrees.] At the salient angle (a rocky peninsula) of\r\ntheir junction, we could almost place one foot in the cold stream and\r\nthe other in the warmer. There is a no less marked difference in the\r\ncolour of the two rivers; the Teesta being sea-green and muddy, the\r\nGreat Rungeet dark green and very clear; and the waters, like those\r\nof the Arve and Rhone at Geneva, preserve their colours for some\r\nhundred yards; the line separating the two being most distinctly\r\ndrawn. The Teesta, or main stream, is much the broadest (about 80 or\r\n100 yards wide at this season), the most rapid and deep. The rocks\r\nwhich skirt its bank were covered with a silt or mud deposit, which I\r\nnowhere observed along the Great Rungeet, and which, as well as its\r\ncolour and coldness, was owing to the vast number of then melting\r\nglaciers drained by this river. The Rungeet, on the other hand,\r\nthough it rises amongst the glaciers of Kinchinjunga and its sister\r\npeaks, is chiefly supplied by the rainfall of the outer ranges of\r\nSinchul and Singalelah, and hence its waters are clear, except during\r\nthe height of the rains.\r\n\r\nFrom this place we returned to Dorjiling, arriving on the afternoon\r\nof the following day.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting trip to be made from Dorjiling, is that to the\r\nsummit of Tonglo, a mountain on the Singalelah range, 10,079 feet\r\nhigh, due west of the station, and twelve miles in a straight line,\r\nbut fully thirty by the path.* [A full account of the botanical\r\nfeatures noticed on this excursion (which I made in May, 1848, with\r\nMr. Barnes) has appeared in the \"London Journal of Botany,\" and the\r\n\"Horticultural Society's Journal,\" and I shall, therefore,\r\nrecapitulate its leading incidents only.]\r\n\r\nLeaving the station by a native path, the latter plunges at once into\r\na forest, and descends very rapidly, occasionally emerging on cleared\r\nspurs, where are fine crops of various millets, with much maize and\r\nrice. Of the latter grain as many as eight or ten varieties are\r\ncultivated, but seldom irrigated, which, owing to the dampness of the\r\nclimate, is not necessary: the produce is often eighty-fold, but the\r\ngrain is large, coarse, reddish, and rather gelatinous when boiled.\r\nAfter burning the timber, the top soil is very fertile for several\r\nseasons, abounding in humus, below which is a stratum of stiff clay,\r\noften of great thickness, produced by the disintegration of the\r\nrocks;* [An analysis of the soil will be found in the Appendix.] the\r\nclay makes excellent bricks, and often contains nearly 30 per cent.\r\nof alumina.\r\n\r\nAt about 4000 feet the great bamboo (\"Pao\" Lepcha) abounds; it\r\nflowers every year, which is not the case with all others of this\r\ngenus, most of which flower profusely over large tracts of country,\r\nonce in a great many years, and then die away; their place being\r\nsupplied by seedlings, which grow with immense rapidity.\r\nThis well-known fact is not due, as some suppose, to the life of the\r\nspecies being of such a duration, but to favourable circumstances in\r\nthe season. The Pao attains a height of 40 to 60 feet, and the culms\r\naverage in thickness the human thigh; it is used for large\r\nwater-vessels, and its leaves form admirable thatch, in universal use\r\nfor European houses at Dorjiling. Besides this, the Lepchas are\r\nacquainted with nearly a dozen kinds of bamboo; these occur at\r\nvarious elevations below 12,000 feet, forming, even in the\r\npine-woods, and above their zone, in the skirts of the _Rhododendron_\r\nscrub, a small and sometimes almost impervious jungle. In an\r\neconomical point of view they maybe classed as those which split\r\nreadily, and those which do not. The young shoots of several are\r\neaten, and the seeds of one are made into a fermented drink, and into\r\nbread in times of scarcity; but it would take many pages to describe\r\nthe numerous purposes to which the various species are put.\r\n\r\nIllusration -- LEPCHA WATER-CARRIER WITH A BAMBOO CHUNGI.\r\n\r\nGordonia is their most common tree (_G. Wallichii_), much prized for\r\nploughshares and other purposes requiring a hard wood: it is the\r\n\"Sing-brang-kun\" of the Lepchas, and ascends to 4000 feet. Oaks at\r\nthis elevation occur as solitary trees, of species different from\r\nthose of Dorjiling. There are three or four with a cup-shaped\r\ninvolucre, and three with spinous involucres enclosing an eatable\r\nsweet nut; these generally grow on a dry clayey soil.\r\n\r\nSome low steep spurs were well cultivated, though the angle of the\r\nfield was upwards of 25 degrees; the crops, chiefly maize, were just\r\nsprouting. This plant is occasionally hermaphrodite in Sikkim, the\r\nflowers forming a large drooping panicle and ripening small grains;\r\nit is, however, a rare occurrence, and the specimens are highly\r\nvalued by the people.\r\n\r\nThe general prevalence of figs,* [One species of this very tropical\r\ngenus ascends almost to 9000 feet on the outer ranges of Sikkim.] and\r\ntheir allies, the nettles,* [Of two of these cloth is made, and of a\r\nthird, cordage. The tops of two are eaten, as are several species of\r\n_Procris._ The \"Poa\" belongs to this order, yielding that kind of\r\ngrass cloth fibre, now abundantly imported into England from the\r\nMalay Islands, and used extensively for shirting.] is a remarkable\r\nfeature in the botany of the Sikkim Himalaya, up to nearly 10,000\r\nfeet. Of the former there were here five species, some bearing\r\neatable and very palatable fruit of enormous size, others with the\r\nfruit small and borne on prostrate, leafless branches, which spring\r\nfrom the root and creep along the ground.\r\n\r\nA troublesome, dipterous insect (the \"Peepsa,\" a species of\r\n_Siamulium_) swarms on the banks of the streams; it is very small and\r\nblack, floating like a speck before the eye; its bite leaves a spot\r\nof extravasated blood under the cuticle, very irritating if\r\nnot opened.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Little Rungeet river, we camped on the base of Tonglo.\r\nThe night was calm and clear, with faint cirrus, but no dew.\r\nA thermometer sunk two feet in rich vegetable mould stood at 78\r\ndegrees two hours after it was lowered, and the same on the following\r\nmorning. This probably indicates the mean temperature of the month at\r\nthat spot, where, however, the dark colour of the exposed loose soil\r\nmust raise the temperature considerably.\r\n\r\n_May 20th._--The temperature at sunrise was 67 degrees; the morning\r\nbright, and clear over head, but the mountains looked threatening.\r\nDorjiling, perched on a ridge 5000 feet above us, had a singular\r\nappearance. We ascended the Simonbong spur of Tonglo, so called from\r\na small village and Lama temple of that name on its summit; where we\r\narrived at noon, and passing some chaits* [The chait of Sikkim,\r\nborrowed from Tibet, is a square pedestal, surmounted with a\r\nhemisphere, the convex end downwards, and on it is placed a cone,\r\nwith a crescent on the top. These are erected as tombs to Lamas, and\r\nas monuments to illustrious persons, and are venerated accordingly,\r\nthe people always passing them from left to right, often repeating\r\nthe invocation, \"Ora Mani Padmi om.\"] gained the Lama's residence.\r\n\r\nTwo species of bamboo, the \"Payong\" and \"Praong\" of the Lepchas, here\r\nreplace the Pao of the lower regions. The former was flowering\r\nabundantly, the whole of the culms (which were 20 feet high) being a\r\ndiffuse panicle of inflorescence. The \"Praong\" bears a round head of\r\nflowers at the ends of the leafy branches. Wild strawberry, violet,\r\ngeranium, etc., announced our approach to the temperate zone.\r\nAround the temple were potato crops and peach-trees, rice, millet,\r\nyam, brinjal (egg-apple), fennel, hemp (for smoking its narcotic\r\nleaves), and cummin, etc. The potato thrives extremely well as a\r\nsummer crop, at 7000 feet, in Sikkim, though I think the root (from\r\nthe Dorjiling stock) cultivated as a winter crop in the plains, is\r\nsuperior both in size and flavour. Peaches never ripen in this part\r\nof Sikkim, apparently from the want of sun; the tree grows well at\r\nfrom 3000 to 7000 feet elevation, and flowers abundantly; the fruit\r\nmaking the nearest approach to maturity (according to the elevation)\r\nfrom July to October. At Dorjiling it follows the English seasons,\r\nflowering in March and fruiting in September, when the scarce\r\nreddened and still hard fruit falls from the tree. In the plains of\r\nIndia, both this and the plum ripen in May, but the fruits are\r\nvery acid.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that throughout this temperate region, there is hardly\r\nan eatable fruit except the native walnut, and some brambles, of\r\nwhich the \"yellow\" and \"ground raspberry\" are the best, some insipid\r\nfigs, and a very austere crab-apple. The European apple will scarcely\r\nripen,* [This fruit, and several others, ripen at Katmandoo, in Nepal\r\n(alt. 4000 feet), which place enjoys more sunshine than Sikkim.\r\nI have, however, received very differedt accounts of the produce,\r\nwhich, on the whole, appears to be inferior.] and the pear not at\r\nall. Currants and gooseberries show no disposition to thrive, and\r\nstrawberries are the only fruits that ripen at all, which they do in\r\nthe greatest abundance. Vines, figs, pomegranates, plums, apricots,\r\netc., will not succeed even as trees. European vegetables again grow,\r\nand thrive remarkably well throughout the summer of Dorjiling, and\r\nthe produce is very fair, sweet and good, but inferior in flavour to\r\nthe English.\r\n\r\nOf tropical fruits cultivated below 4000 feet, oranges and\r\nindifferent bananas alone are frequent, with lemons of various kinds.\r\nThe season for these is, however, very short; though that of the\r\nplantain might with care be prolonged; oranges abound in winter, and\r\nare excellent, but neither so large nor free of white pulp as those\r\nof the Khasia hills, the West Indies, or the west coast of Africa.\r\nMangos are brought from the plains, for though wild in Sikkim, the\r\ncultivated kinds do not thrive; I have seen the pine-apple plant, but\r\nI never met with good fruit on it.\r\n\r\nA singular and almost total absence of the light, and of the direct\r\nrays of the sun in the ripening season, is the cause of this dearth\r\nof fruit. Both the farmer and orchard gardener in England know full\r\nwell the value of a bright sky as well as of a warm autumnal\r\natmosphere. Without this corn does not ripen, and fruit-trees are\r\nblighted. The winter of the plains of India being more analogous in\r\nits distribution of moisture and heat to a European summer, such\r\nfruits as the peach, vine, and even plum, fig, strawberry, etc., may\r\nbe brought to bear well in March, April, and May, if they are only\r\ncarefully tended through the previous hot and damp season, which is,\r\nin respect to the functions of flowering and fruiting, their winter.\r\n\r\nHence it appears that, though some English fruits will turn the\r\nwinter solstice of Bengal (November to May) into summer, and then\r\nflower and fruit, neither these nor others will thrive in the summer\r\nof 7000 feet on the Sikkim Himalaya, (though its temperature so\r\nnearly approaches that of England,) on account of its rain and fogs.\r\nFurther, they are often exposed to a winter's cold equal to the\r\naverage of that of London, the snow lying for a week on the ground,\r\nand the thermometer descending to 25 degrees. It is true that in no\r\ncase is the extreme of cold so great here as in England, but it is\r\nsufficient to check vegetation, and to prevent fruit-trees from\r\nflowering till they are fruiting in the plains. There is in this\r\nrespect a great difference between the climate of the central and\r\neastern and western Himalaya, at equal elevations. In the western\r\n(Kumaon, etc.) the winters are colder than in Sikkim--the summers\r\nwarmer and less humid. The rainy season is shorter, and the sun\r\nshines so much more frequently between the heavy showers, that the\r\napple and other fruits are brought to a much better state. It is true\r\nthat the rain-gauge may show as great a fall there, but this is no\r\nmeasure of the humidity of the atmosphere, and still less so of the\r\namount of the sun's direct light and heat intercepted by aqueous\r\nvapour, for it takes no account of the quantity of moisture suspended\r\nin the air, nor of the depositions from fogs, which are far more\r\nfatal to the perfecting of fruits than the heaviest brief showers.\r\n\r\nThe Indian climate, which is marked by one season of excessive\r\nhumidity and the other of excessive drought, can never be favourable\r\nto the production either of good European or tropical fruits.\r\nHence there is not one of the latter peculiar to the country, and\r\nperhaps but one which arrives at full perfection; namely, the mango.\r\nTile plantains, oranges, and pine-apples are less abundant, of\r\ninferior kinds, and remain a shorter season in perfection than they\r\ndo in South America, the West Indies, or Western Africa.\r\n\r\nIllustration -- LEPCHA AMULET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nContinue the ascent of Tonglo -- Trees -- Lepcha construction of hut\r\n-- Simsibong -- Climbing-trees -- Frogs -- Magnolias, etc. -- Ticks\r\n-- Leeches -- -- Cattle, murrain amongst -- Summit of Tonglo --\r\nRhododendrons -- Skimmia -- Yew -- Rose -- Aconite -- Bikh poison --\r\nEnglish genera of plants -- Ascent of tropical orders -- Comparison\r\nwith south temperate zone -- Heavy rain -- Temperature, etc. --\r\nDescent -- Simonbong temple -- Furniture therein -- Praying-cylinder\r\n-- Thigh-bone trumpet -- Morning orisons -- Present of Murwa\r\nbeer, etc.\r\n\r\nContinuing the ascent of Tonglo, we left cultivation and the poor\r\ngroves of peaches at 4000 to 5000 feet (and this on the eastern\r\nexposure, which is by far the sunniest), the average height which\r\nagriculture reaches in Sikkim.\r\n\r\nAbove Simonbong, the path up Tonglo is little frequented: it is one\r\nof the many routes between Nepal and Sikkim, which cross the\r\nSingalelah spur of Kinchinjunga at various elevations between 7000\r\nand 15,000 feet. As usual, the track runs along ridges, wherever\r\nthese are to be found, very steep, and narrow at the top, through\r\ndeep humid forests of oaks and Magnolias, many laurels, both\r\n_Tetranthera_ and _Cinnamomum,_ one species of the latter ascending\r\nto 8,500 feet, and one of _Tetranthera_ to 9000. Chesnut and walnut\r\nhere appeared, with some leguminous trees, which however did not\r\nascend to 6000 feet. Scarlet flowers of _Vaccinium serpens,_ an\r\nepiphytical species, were strewed about, and the great blossoms of\r\n_Rhododendron Dalhousiae_ and of a Magnolia (_Talaunaa Hodgsoni_) lay\r\ntogether on the ground. The latter forms a large tree, with very\r\ndense foliage, and deep shining green leaves, a foot to eighteen\r\ninches long. Most of its flowers drop unexpanded from the tree, and\r\ndiffuse a very aromatic smell; they are nearly as large as the fist,\r\nthe outer petals purple, the inner pure white.\r\n\r\nHeavy rain came on at 3 p.m., obliging us to take insufficient\r\nshelter under the trees, and finally to seek the nearest\r\ncamping-ground. For this purpose we ascended to a spring, called\r\nSimsibong, at an elevation of 6000 feet. The narrowness of the ridge\r\nprevented our pitching the tent, small as it was; but the Lepchas\r\nrapidly constructed a house, and thatched it with bamboo and the\r\nbroad leaves of the wild plantain. A table was then raised in the\r\nmiddle, of four posts and as many cross pieces of wood, lashed with\r\nstrips of bamboo. Across these, pieces of bamboo were laid,\r\ningeniously flattened, by selecting cylinders, crimping them all\r\nround, and then slitting each down one side, so that it opens into a\r\nflat slab. Similar but longer and lower erections, one on each side\r\nthe table, formed bed or chair; and in one hour, half a dozen men,\r\nwith only long knives and active hands, had provided us with a\r\ntolerably water-tight furnished house. A thick flooring of hamboo\r\nleaves kept the feet dry, and a screen of that and other foliage all\r\nround rendered the habitation tolerably warm.\r\n\r\nAt this elevation we found great scandent trees twisting around the\r\ntrunks of others, and strangling them: the latter gradually decay,\r\nleaving the sheath of climbers as one of the most remarkable\r\nvegetable phenomena of these mountains. These climbers belong to\r\nseveral orders, and may be roughly classified in two groups.--\r\n(1.) Those whose sterns merely twine, and by constricting certain\r\nparts of their support, induce death.--(2.) Those which form a\r\nnetwork round the trunk, by the coalescence of their lateral branches\r\nand aerial roots, etc.: these wholly envelop and often conceal the\r\ntree they enclose, whose branches appear rising far above those of\r\nits destroyer. To the first of these groups belong many natural\r\norders, of which the most prominent are--_Leguminosae,_ ivies,\r\nhydrangea, vines, _Pothos,_ etc. The inosculating ones are almost all\r\nfigs and _Wightia_: the latter is the most remarkable, and I add a\r\ncut of its grasping roots, sketched at our encampment.\r\n\r\nIllustration -- CLASPING ROOTS OF WIGHTIA.\r\n\r\nExcept for the occasional hooting of an owl, the night was profoundly\r\nstill during several hours after dark--the cicadas at this season not\r\nascending so high on the mountain. A dense mist shrouded every thing,\r\nand the rain pattered on the leaves of our hut. At midnight a\r\ntree-frog (\"Simook,\" Lepcha) broke the silence with his curious\r\nmetallic clack, and others quickly joined the chorus, keeping up\r\ntheir strange music till morning. Like many Batrachians, this has a\r\nvoice singularly unlike that of any other organised creature.\r\nThe cries of beasts, birds, and insects are all explicable to our\r\nsenses, and we can recognise most of them as belonging to such or\r\nsuch an order of animal; but the voices of many frogs are like\r\nnothing else, and allied species utter totally dissimilar noises.\r\nIn some, as this, the sound is like the concussion of metals; in\r\nothers, of the vibration of wires or cords; anything but the natural\r\neffects of lungs, larynx, and muscles.* [A very common Tasmanian\r\nspecies utters a sound that appears to ring in an underground vaulted\r\nchamber, beneath the feet.]\r\n\r\n_May_ 21.--Early this morning we proceeded upwards, our prospect more\r\ngloomy than ever. The path, which still lay up steep ridges, was very\r\nslippery, owing to the rain upon the clayey soil, and was only\r\npassable from the hold afforded by interlacing roots of trees.\r\nAt 8000 feet, some enormous detached masses of micaceous gneiss rose\r\nabruptly from the ridge, they were covered with mosses and ferns, and\r\nfrom their summit, 7000 feet, a good view of the surrounding\r\nvegetation is obtained. The mast of the forest is formed of:--\r\n(1) Three species of oak, of which _Q. annulata ?_ with immense\r\nlamellated acorns, and leaves sixteen inches long, is the tallest and\r\nthe most abundant.--(2) Chesnut.--(3) _Laurineae_ of several species,\r\nall beautiful forest-trees, straight-holed, and umbrageous\r\nabove.--(4) Magnolias.* [Other trees were _Pyrus, Saurauja_ (both an\r\nerect and climbing species), _Olea,_ cherry, birch, alder, several\r\nmaples, _Hydrangea,_ one species of fig, holly, and several\r\n_Araliaceous_ trees. Many species of _Magnoliaceae_ (including the\r\ngenera _Magnolia, Michelia,_ and _Talauma_) are found in Sikkim:\r\n_Magnolia Campbellii,_ of 10,000 feet, is the most superb species\r\nknown. In books on botanical geography, the magnolias are considered\r\nas most abounding in North America, east of the Rocky Mountains; but\r\nthis is a great mistake, the Indian mountains and islands being the\r\ncentre of this natural order.]--(5) Arborescent rhododendrons, which\r\ncommence here with the _R. arboreum._ At 8000 and 9000 feet, a\r\nconsiderable change is found in the vegetation; the gigantic purple\r\n_Magnolia Campbellii_ replacing the white; chesnut disappears, and\r\nseveral laurels: other kinds of maple are seen, with _Rhododendron\r\nargenteum,_ and _Stauntonia,_ a handsome climber, which has beautiful\r\npendent clusters of lilac blossoms.\r\n\r\nAt 9000 feet we arrived on a long flat covered with lofty trees,\r\nchiefly purple magnolias, with a few oaks, great _Pyri_ and two\r\nrhododendrons, thirty to forty feet high (_R. barbatum,_ and _R.\r\narboreum,_ var. _roseum_): _Skimmia_ and _Symplocos_ were the common\r\nshrubs. A beautiful orchid with purple flowers (_Caelogyne\r\nWallichii_) grew on the trunks of all the great trees, attaining a\r\nhigher elevation than most other epiphytical species, for I have seen\r\nit at 10,000 feet.\r\n\r\nA large tick infests the small bamboo, and a more hateful insect I\r\nnever encountered. The traveller cannot avoid these insects coming on\r\nhis person (sometimes in great numbers) as he brushes through the\r\nforest; they get inside his dress, and insert the proboscis deeply\r\nwithout pain. Buried head and shoulders, and retained by a barbed\r\nlancet, the tick is only to be extracted by force, which is very\r\npainful. I have devised many tortures, mechanical and chemical, to\r\ninduce these disgusting intruders to withdraw the proboscis, but in\r\nvain. Leeches* [I cannot but think that the extraordinary abundance\r\nof these _Anelides_ in Sikkim may cause the death of many animals.\r\nSome marked murrains have followed very wet seasons, when the leeches\r\nappear in incredible numbers; and the disease in the cattle,\r\ndescribed to me by the Lepchas as in the stomach, in no way differs\r\nfrom what leeches would produce. It is a well-known fact, that these\r\ncreatures have lived for days in the fauces, nares, and stomachs of\r\nthe human subject, causing dreadful sufferings, and death. I have\r\nseen the cattle feeding in places where the leeches so abounded, that\r\nfifty or sixty were frequently together on my ankles; and ponies are\r\nalmost maddened by their biting the fetlocks.] also swarm below 7000\r\nfeet; a small black species above 3000 feet, and a large yellow-brown\r\nsolitary one below that elevation.\r\n\r\nOur ascent to the summit was by the bed of a watercourse, now a\r\nroaring torrent, from the heavy and incessant rain. A small\r\n_Anagallis_ (like _tenella_), and a beautiful purple primrose, grew\r\nby its bank. The top of the mountain is another flat ridge, with\r\ndepressions and broad pools. The number of additional species of\r\nplants found here was great, and all betokened a rapid approach to\r\nthe alpine region of the Himalaya. In order of prevalence the trees\r\nwere,--the scarlet _Rhododendron arboreum_ and _barbatum,_ as large\r\nbushy trees, both loaded with beautiful flowers and luxuriant\r\nfoliage; _R. Falconeri,_ in point of foliage the most superb of all\r\nthe Himalayan species, with trunks thirty feet high, and branches\r\nbearing at their ends only leaves eighteen inches long: these are\r\ndeep green above, and covered beneath with a rich brown down. Next in\r\nabundance to these were shrubs of _Skimmia Laureola,_* [This plant\r\nhas been lately introduced into English gardens, from the north-west\r\nHimalaya, and is greatly admired for its aromatic, evergreen foliage,\r\nand clusters of scarlet berries. It is a curious fact, that this\r\nplant never bears scarlet berries in Sikkim, apparently owing to the\r\nwant of sun; the fruit ripens, but is of a greenish-red or purplish\r\ncolour.] _Symplocos,_ and Hydrangea; and there were still a few\r\npurple magnolias, very large _Pyri,_ like mountain ash, and the\r\ncommon English yew, eighteen feet in circumference, the red bark of\r\nwhich is used as a dye, and for staining the foreheads of Brahmins in\r\nNepal. An erect white-flowered rose (_R. sericea,_ the only species\r\noccurring in Southern Sikkim) was very abundant: its numerous\r\ninodorous flowers are pendent, apparent as a protection from the\r\nrain; and it is remarkable as being the only species having four\r\npetals instead of five.\r\n\r\nA currant was common, always growing epiphytically on the trunks of\r\nlarge trees. Two or three species of Berberry, a cherry, Andromeda,\r\n_Daphne,_ and maple, nearly complete, I think, the list of woody\r\nplants. Amongst the herbs were many of great interest, as a rhubarb,\r\nand _Aconitum palmatum,_ which yields one of the celebrated \"Bikh\"\r\npoisons.* [\"Bikh\" is yielded by various _Aconita._ All the Sikkim\r\nkinds are called \"gniong\" by Lepchas and Bhoteeas, who do not\r\ndistinguish them. The _A. Napellus_ is abundant in the north-west\r\nHimalaya, and is perhaps as virulent a Bikh as any species.]\r\nOf European genera I found _Thalictrum, Anemone, Fumaria,_ violets,\r\n_Stellaria, Hypericum,_ two geraniums, balsams, _Epilobium,\r\nPotentilla, Paris_ and _Convallariae,_ one of the latter has\r\nverticillate leaves, and its root also called \"bikh,\" is considered a\r\nvery virulent poison.\r\n\r\nStill, the absence or rarity at this elevation of several very large\r\nnatural families,* [_Ranunculaceae, Fumariae, Cruciferae, Alsineae,\r\nGeranicae, Leguminosae, Potentilla, Epilobium, Crassulaceae,\r\nSaxifrageae, Umbelliferae, Lonicera, Valerianeae, Dipsaceae,_ various\r\ngenera of _Compositae, Campanulaceae, Lobeliaceae, Gentianeae,\r\nBoragineae, Scrophularineae, Primulaceae, Gramineae._] which have\r\nnumerous representatives at and much below the same level in the\r\ninner ranges, and on the outer of the Western Himalaya, indicate a\r\ncertain peculiarity in Sikkim. On the other hand, certain tropical\r\ngenera are more abundant in the temperate zone of the Sikkim\r\nmountains, and ascend much higher there than in the Western Himalaya:\r\nof this fact I have cited conspicuous examples in the palms,\r\nplantains, and tree-ferns. This ascent and prevalence of tropical\r\nspecies is due to the humidity and equability of the climate in this\r\ntemperate zone, and is, perhaps, the direct consequence of these\r\nconditions. An application of the same laws accounts for the\r\nextension of similar features far beyond the tropical limit in the\r\nSouthern Ocean, where various natural orders, which do not cross the\r\n30th and 40th parallels of N. latitude, are extended to the 55th of\r\nS. latitude, and found in Tasmania, New Zealand, the so-called\r\nAntarctic Islands south of that group, and at Cape Horn itself.\r\n\r\nThe rarity of Pines is perhaps the most curious feature in the botany\r\nof Tonglo, and on the outer ranges of Sikkim; for, between the level\r\nof 2,500 feet (the upper limit of _P. longifolia_) and 10,000 feet\r\n(that of the _Taxus_), there is no coniferous tree whatever in\r\nSouthern Sikkim.\r\n\r\nWe encamped amongst Rhododendrons, on a spongy soil of black\r\nvegetable matter, so oozy, that it was difficult to keep the feet\r\ndry. The rain poured in torrents all the evening, and with the calm,\r\nand the wetness of the wood, prevented our enjoying a fire. Except a\r\ntransient view into Nepal, a few miles west of us, nothing was to be\r\nseen, the whole mountain being wrapped in dense masses of vapour.\r\nGusts of wind, not felt in the forest, whistled through the gnarled\r\nand naked tree-tops; and though the temperature was 50 degrees, this\r\nwind produced cold to the feelings. Our poor Lepchas were miserably\r\noff, but always happy: under four posts and a bamboo-leaf thatch,\r\nwith no covering but a single thin cotton garment, they crouched on\r\nthe sodden turf, joking with the Hindoos of our party, who, though\r\nsupplied with good clothing and shelter, were doleful companions.\r\n\r\nI made a shed for my instruments under a tree; Mr. Barnes, ever\r\nactive and ready, floored the tent with logs of wood, and I laid a\r\n\"corduroy road\" of the same to my little observatory.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the rain did not abate; and the tent-roof leaked in\r\nsuch torrents, that we had to throw pieces of wax-cloth over our\r\nshoulders as we lay in bed. There was no improvement whatever in the\r\nweather on the following morning. Two of the Hindoos had crawled into\r\nthe tent during the night, attacked with fever and ague.* [It is a\r\nremarkable fact, that both the natives of the plains, under many\r\ncircumstances, and the Lepchas when suffering from protracted cold\r\nand wet, take fever and ague in sharp attacks. The disease is wholly\r\nunknown amongst Europeans residing above 4000 feet, similar exposure\r\nin whom brings on rheumatism and cold.] The tent being too sodden to\r\nbe carried, we had to remain where we were, and with abundance of\r\nnovelty in the botany around, I found no difficulty in getting\r\nthrough the day. Observing the track of sheep, we sent two Lepchas to\r\nfollow them, who returned at night from some miles west in Nepal,\r\nbringing two. The shepherds were Geroongs of Nepal, who were grazing\r\ntheir flocks on a grassy mountain top, from which the woods had been\r\ncleared, probably by fire. The mutton was a great boon to the\r\nLepchas, but the Hindoos would not touch it, and several more\r\nsickening during the day, we had the tent most uncomfortably full.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the 22nd, from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., the thermometer\r\nnever varied 6.5 degrees, ranging from 47.5 in the morning to 54\r\ndegrees, its maximum, at 1 p.m., and 50.75 at night. At seven the\r\nfollowing morning it was the same. One, sunk two feet six inches in\r\nmould and clay, stood constantly at 50.75. The dew-point was always\r\nbelow the temperature, at which I was surprised, for more drenching\r\nweather could not well be. The mean dew-point was 50.25, and\r\nconsequent humidity, 0.973.\r\n\r\nThese observations, and those of the barometer, were taken 60 feet\r\nbelow the summit, to which I moved the instruments on the morning of\r\nthe 23rd. At a much more exposed spot the results would no doubt have\r\nbeen different, for a thermometer, there sunk to the same depth as\r\nthat below, stood at 49.75 (or one degree colder than 60 feet lower\r\ndown). My barometrical observations, taken simultaneously with those\r\nof Calcutta, give the height of Tonglo, 10,078.3 feet; Colonel\r\nWaugh's, by trigonometry, 10,079.4 feet,--a remarkable and unusual\r\ncoincidence.\r\n\r\n_May_ 23.--We spent a few hours of alternate fog and sunshine on the\r\ntop of the mountain, vainly hoping for the most modest view; our\r\ninability to obtain it was extremely disappointing, for the mountain\r\ncommands a superb prospect, which I enjoyed fully in the following\r\nNovember, from a spot a few miles further west. The air, which was\r\nalways foggy, was alternately cooled and heated, as it blew over the\r\ntrees, or the open space we occupied; sometimes varying 5 degrees and\r\n6 degrees in a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nHaving partially dried the tent in the wind, we commenced the\r\ndescent, which owing to the late torrents of rain, was most fatiguing\r\nand slippery; it again commenced to drizzle at noon, nor was it till\r\nwe had descended to 6000 feet that we emerged from the region of\r\nclouds. By dark we arrived at Simonbong, having descended 5000 feet,\r\nat the rate of 1000 feet an hour; and were kindly received by the\r\nLama, who gave us his temple for the accommodation of the whole\r\nparty. We were surprised at this, both because the Sikkim authorities\r\nhad represented the Lamas as very averse to Europeans, and because he\r\nmight well have hesitated before admitting a promiscuous horde of\r\nthirty people into a sacred building, where the little valuables on\r\nthe altar, etc., were quite at our disposal. A better tribute could\r\nnot well have been paid to the honesty of my Lepcha followers. Our\r\nhost only begged us not to disturb his people, nor to allow the\r\nHindoos of our party to smoke inside.\r\n\r\nIllustration--SIMONBONG TEMPLE.\r\n\r\nSimonbong is one of the smallest and poorest Gumpas, or temples, in\r\nSikkim: unlike the better class, it is built of wood only.\r\nIt consisted of one large room, with small sliding shutter windows,\r\nraised on a stone foundation, and roofed with shingles of wood;\r\nopposite the door a wooden altar was placed, rudely chequered with\r\nblack, white, and red; to the right and left were shelves, with a few\r\nTibetan books, wrapped in silk; a model of Symbonath temple in Nepal,\r\na praying-cylinder,* [It consisted of a leathern cylinder placed\r\nupright in a frame; a projecting piece of iron strikes a little bell\r\nat each revolution, the revolution being caused by an elbowed axle\r\nand string. Within the cylinder are deposited written prayers, and\r\nwhoever pulls the string properly is considered to have repeated his\r\nprayers as often as the bell rings. Representations of these\r\nimplements will be found in other parts of these volumes.] and some\r\nimplements for common purposes, bags of juniper, English wine-bottles\r\nand glasses, with tufts of _Abies Webbiana,_ rhododendron flowers,\r\nand peacock's feathers, besides various trifles, clay ornaments and\r\nofferings, and little Hindoo idols. On the altar were ranged seven\r\nlittle brass cups, full of water; a large conch shell, carved with\r\nthe sacred lotus; a brass jug from Lhassa, of beautiful design, and a\r\nhuman thigh-bone, hollow, and perforated through both condyles.* [To\r\nthese are often added a double-headed rattle, or small drum, formed\r\nof two crowns of human skulls, cemented back to back; each face is\r\nthen covered with parchment, and encloses some pebbles. Sometimes\r\nthis instrument is provided with a handle.]\r\n\r\nIllustration--TRUMPET MADE OF A HUMAN THIGH-BONE.\r\n\r\n Facing the altar was a bench and a chair, and on one side a huge\r\ntambourine, with two curved iron drum-sticks. The bench was covered\r\nwith bells, handsomely carved with idols, and censers with\r\njuniper-ashes; and on it lay the _dorge,_ or double-headed\r\nthunderbolt, which the Lama holds in his hand during service. Of all\r\nthese articles, the human thigh-bone is by much the most curious; it\r\nis very often that of a Lama, and is valuable in proportion to its\r\nlength.* [It is reported at Dorjiling, that one of the first\r\nEuropeans buried at this station, being a tall man, was disinterred\r\nby the resurrectionist Bhoteeas for his _trumpet-bones.] As, however,\r\nthe Sikkim Lamas are burned, the relics are generally procured from\r\nTibet, where the  corpses are cut in pieces and thrown to the kites,\r\nor into the water.\r\n\r\nTwo boys usually reside in the temple, and their beds were given up\r\nto us, which being only rough planks laid on the floor, proved clean\r\nin one sense, but contrasted badly with the springy couch of bamboo\r\nthe Lepcha makes, which renders carrying a mattress or aught but\r\nblankets superfluous.\r\n\r\n_May_ 24.--We were awakened at daylight by the discordant orisons of\r\nthe Lama; these commenced by the boys beating the great tambourine,\r\nthen blowing the conch-shells, and finally the trumpets and\r\nthigh-bone. Shortly the Lama entered, clad in scarlet, shorn and\r\nbarefooted, wearing a small red silk mitre, a loose gown girt round\r\nthe middle, and an under-garment of questionable colour, possibly\r\nonce purple. He walked along, slowly muttering his prayers, to the\r\nend of the apartment, whence he took a brass bell and dorge, and,\r\nsitting down cross-legged, commenced matins, counting his beads, or\r\nringing the bell, and uttering most dismal prayers. After various\r\ndisposals of the cups, a larger bell was violently rung for some\r\nminutes, himself snapping his fingers and uttering most unearthly\r\nsounds. Finally, incense was brought, of charcoal with\r\njuniper-sprigs; it was swung about, and concluded the morning service\r\nto our great relief, for the noises were quite intolerable. Fervid as\r\nthe devotions appeared, to judge by their intonation, I fear the Lama\r\nfelt more curious about us than was proper under the circumstances;\r\nand when I tried to sketch him, his excitement knew no bounds; he\r\nfairly turned round on the settee, and, continuing his prayers and\r\nbell-accompaniment, appeared to be exorcising me, or some spirit\r\nwithin me.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the Lama came to visit us, bringing rice, a few\r\nvegetables, and a large bamboo-work bowl, thickly varnished with\r\nindia-rubber, and waterproof, containing half-fermented millet.\r\nThis mixture, called _Murwa,_ is invariably offered to the traveller,\r\neither in the state of fermented grain, or more commonly in a bamboo\r\njug, filled quite up with warm water; when the fluid, sucked through\r\na reed, affords a refreshing drink. He gratefully accepted a few\r\nrupees and trifles which we had to spare.\r\n\r\nLeaving Simonbong, we descended to the Little Rungeet, where the heat\r\nof the valley was very great; 80 degrees at noon, and that of the\r\nstream 69 degrees; the latter was an agreeable temperature for the\r\ncoolies, who plunged, teeming with perspiration, into the water,\r\ncatching fish with their hands. We reached Dorjiling late in the\r\nevening, again drenched with rain; our people, Hindoo and Lepcha,\r\nimprudently remaining for the night in the valley. Owing probably as\r\nmuch to the great exposure they had lately gone through, as to the\r\nsudden transition from a mean temperature of 50 degrees in a bracing\r\nwind, to a hot close jungly valley at 75 degrees, no less than seven\r\nwere laid up with fever and ague.\r\n\r\nFew excursions can afford a better idea of the general features and\r\nrich luxuriance of the Sikkim Himalaya than that to Tonglo. It is\r\nalways interesting to roam with an aboriginal, and especially a\r\nmountain people, through their thinly inhabited valleys, over their\r\ngrand mountains, and to dwell alone with them in their gloomy and\r\nforbidding forests, and no thinking man can do so without learning\r\nmuch, however slender be the means at his command for communion.\r\nA more interesting and attractive companion than the Lepcha I never\r\nlived with: cheerful, kind, and patient with a master to whom he is\r\nattached; rude but not savage, ignorant and yet intelligent; with the\r\nsimple resource of a plain knife he makes his house and furnishes\r\nyours, with a speed, alacrity, and ingenuity that wile away that\r\nwell-known long hour when the weary pilgrim frets for his couch.\r\nIn all my dealings with these people, they proved scrupulously\r\nhonest. Except for drunkenness and carelessness, I never had to\r\ncomplain of any of the merry troop; some of whom, bareheaded and\r\nbarelegged, possessing little or nothing save a cotton garment and a\r\nlong knife, followed me for many months on subsequent occasions, from\r\nthe scorching plains to the everlasting snows. Ever foremost in the\r\nforest or on the bleak mountain, and ever ready to help, to carry, to\r\nencamp, collect, or cook, they cheer on the traveller by their\r\nunostentatious zeal in his service, and are spurs to his progress.\r\n\r\nIllustration--TIBETAN AMULET.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDifficulty in procuring leave to enter Sikkim -- Obtain permission to\r\ntravel in East Nepal -- Arrangements -- Coolies -- Stores -- Servants\r\n-- Personal equipment -- Mode of travelling -- Leave Dorjiling --\r\nGoong ridge -- Behaviour of Bhotan coolies -- Nepal frontier -- Myong\r\nvalley -- Ilam -- Sikkim massacre -- Cultivation -- Nettles -- Camp\r\nat Nanki on Tonglo -- Bhotan coolies run away -- View of Chumulari --\r\nNepal peaks to west -- Sakkiazung -- Buceros -- Road to Wallanchoon\r\n-- Oaks -- Scarcity of water -- Singular view of mountain-valleys --\r\nEncampment -- My tent and its furniture -- Evening occupations --\r\nDunkotah -- Crossridge of Sakkiazung -- Yews -- Silver-firs -- View\r\nof Tambur valley -- Pemmi river -- Pebbly terraces -- Geology -- Holy\r\nsprings -- Enormous trees -- Luculia gratissima -- Khawa river, rocks\r\nof -- Arrive at Tambur -- Shingle and gravel terraces -- Natives,\r\nindolence of -- Canoe ferry -- Votive offerings -- Bad road --\r\nTemperature, etc. -- Chingtam village, view from -- Mywa river and\r\nGuola -- House -- Boulders -- Chain-bridge -- Meepo, arrival of --\r\nFevers.   Owing to the unsatisfactory nature of our relations with\r\nthe Sikkim authorities, to which I have elsewhere alluded, my\r\nendeavours to procure leave to penetrate further beyond the Dorjiling\r\nterritory than Tonglo, were attended with some trouble and delay.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1848, the Governor-General communicated with the\r\nRajah, desiring him to grant me honourable and safe escort through\r\nhis dominions; but this was at once met by a decided refusal,\r\napparently admitting of no compromise. Pending further negotiations,\r\nwhich Dr. Campbell felt sure would terminate satisfactorily, though\r\nperhaps too late for my purpose, he applied to the Nepal Rajah for\r\npermission for me to visit the Tibetan passes, west of Kinchinjunga;\r\nproposing in the meanwhile to arrange for my return through Sikkim.\r\nThrough the kindness of Col. Thoresby, the Resident at that Court,\r\nand the influence of Jung Bahadoor, this request was promptly acceded\r\nto, and a guard of six Nepalese soldiers and two officers was sent to\r\nDorjiling to conduct me to any part of the eastern districts of Nepal\r\nwhich I might select. I decided upon following up the Tambur, a\r\nbranch of the Arun river, and exploring the two easternmost of the\r\nNepalese passes into Tibet (Wallanchoon and Kanglachem), which would\r\nbring me as near to the central mass and loftiest part of the eastern\r\nflank of Kinchinjunga as possible.\r\n\r\nFor this expedition (which occupied three months), all the\r\narrangements were undertaken for me by Dr. Campbell, who afforded me\r\nevery facility which in his government position he could command,\r\nbesides personally superintending the equipment and provisioning of\r\nmy party. Taking horses or loaded animals of any kind was not\r\nexpedient: the whole journey was to be performed on foot, and\r\neverything carried on men's backs. As we were to march through wholly\r\nunexplored countries, where food was only procurable at uncertain\r\nintervals, it was necessary to engage a large body of porters, some\r\nof whom should carry bags of rice for the coolies and themselves too.\r\nThe difficulty of selecting these carriers, of whom thirty were\r\nrequired, was very great. The Lepchas, the best and most tractable,\r\nand over whom Dr. Campbell had the most direct influence, disliked\r\nemployment out of Sikkim, especially in so warlike a country as\r\nNepal: and they were besides thought unfit for the snowy regions.\r\nThe Nepalese, of whom there were many residing as British subjects in\r\nDorjiling, were mostly run-aways from their own country, and afraid\r\nof being claimed, should they return to it, by the lords of the soil.\r\nTo employ Limboos, Moormis, Hindoos, or other natives of low\r\nelevations, was out of the question; and no course appeared advisable\r\nbut to engage some of the Bhotan run-aways domiciled in Dorjiling,\r\nwho are accustomed to travel at all elevations, and fear nothing but\r\na return to the country which they have abandoned as slaves, or as\r\nculprits: they are immensely powerful, and though intractable to the\r\nlast degree, are generally glad to work and behave well for money.\r\nThe choice, as will hereafter be seen, was unfortunate, though at the\r\ntime unanimously approved.\r\n\r\nMy party mustered fifty-six persons. These consisted of myself, and\r\none personal servant, a Portuguese half-caste, who undertook all\r\noffices, and spared me the usual train of Hindoo and Mahometan\r\nservants. My tent and equipments (for which I was greatly indebted to\r\nMr. Hodgson), instruments, bed, box of clothes, books and papers,\r\nrequired a man for each. Seven more carried my papers for drying\r\nplants, and other scientific stores. The Nepalese guard had two\r\ncoolies of their own. My interpreter, the coolie Sirdar (or headman),\r\nand my chief plant collector (a Lepcha), had a man each.\r\nMr. Hodgson's bird and animal shooter, collector, and stuffer, with\r\ntheir ammunition and indispensables, had four more; there were\r\nbesides, three Lepcha lads to climb trees and change the\r\nplant-papers, who had long been in my service in that capacity; and\r\nthe party was completed by fourteen Bhotan coolies laden with food,\r\nconsisting chiefly of rice with ghee, oil, capsicums, salt,\r\nand flour.\r\n\r\nI carried myself a small barometer, a large knife and digger for\r\nplants, note-book, telescope, compass, and other instruments; whilst\r\ntwo or three Lepcha lads who accompanied me as satellites, carried a\r\nbotanising box, thermometers, sextant and artificial horizon,\r\nmeasuring-tape, azimuth compass and stand, geological hammer, bottles\r\nand boxes for insects, sketch-book, etc., arranged in compartments of\r\nstrong canvass bags. The Nepal officer (of the rank of serjeant, I\r\nbelieve) always kept near me with one of his men, rendering\r\ninnumerable little services. Other sepoys were distributed amongst\r\nthe remainder of the party; one went ahead to prepare camping-ground,\r\nand one brought up the rear.\r\n\r\nThe course generally pursued by Himalayan travellers is to march\r\nearly in the morning, and arrive at the camping-ground before or by\r\nnoon, breakfasting before starting, or _en route._ I never followed\r\nthis plan, because it sacrificed the mornings, which were otherwise\r\nprofitably spent in collecting about camp; whereas, if I set off\r\nearly, I was generally too tired with the day's march to employ in\r\nany active pursuit the rest of the daylight, which in November only\r\nlasted till 6 p.m. The men breakfasted early in the morning, I\r\nsomewhat later, and all had started by 10 a.m., arriving between\r\n4 and 6 p.m. at the next camping-ground. My tent was formed of\r\nblankets, spread over cross pieces of wood and a ridge-pole,\r\nenclosing an area of 6 to 8 feet by 4 to 6 feet. The bedstead, table,\r\nand chair were always made by my Lepchas, as described in the Tonglo\r\nexcursion. The evenings I employed in writing up notes and journals,\r\nplotting maps, and ticketing the plants collected during the\r\nday's march.\r\n\r\nI left Dorjiling at noon, on the 27th October, accompanied by Dr.\r\nCampbell, who saw me fairly off, the coolies having preceded me.\r\nOur direct route would have been over Tonglo, but the threats of the\r\nSikkim authorities rendered it advisable to make for Nepal at once;\r\nwe therefore kept west along the Goong ridge, a western prolongation\r\nof Sinchul.\r\n\r\nOn overtaking the coolies, I proceeded for six or seven miles along a\r\nzig-zag road, at about 7,500 feet elevation, through dense forests,\r\nand halted at a little hut within sight of Dorjiling. Rain and mist\r\ncame on at nightfall, and though several parties of my servants\r\narrived, none of the Bhotan coolies made their appearance, and I\r\nspent the night without food or bed, the weather being much too foggy\r\nand dark to send back to meet the missing men. They joined me late on\r\nthe following day, complaining unreasonably of their loads, and\r\nwithout their Sirdar, who, after starting his crew, had returned to\r\ntake leave of his wife and family. On the following day he appeared,\r\nand after due admonishment we started, but four miles further on were\r\nagain obliged to halt for the Bhotan coolies, who were equally deaf\r\nto threats and entreaties. As they did not come up till dusk, we were\r\nobliged to encamp here, (alt. 7,400 feet) at the common source of the\r\nBalasun, which flows to the plains, and the Little Rungeet, whose\r\ncourse is north.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the conduct of the Bhotan men and that of the\r\nLepchas and Nepalese was so marked, that I seriously debated in my\r\nown mind the propriety of sending the former back to Dorjiling, but\r\nyielded to the remonstrances of their Sirdar and the Nepal guard, who\r\nrepresented the great difficulty we should have in replacing them,\r\nand above all, the loss of time, at this season a matter of great\r\nimportance. We accordingly started again the following morning, and\r\nstill keeping in a western direction, crossed the posts in the forest\r\ndividing Sikkim from Nepal, and descended into the Myong valley of\r\nthe latter country, through which flows the river of that name, a\r\ntributary of the Tambur. The Myong valley is remarkably fine: it runs\r\nsouth-west from Tonglo, and its open character and general fertility\r\ncontrast strongly with the bareness of the lower mountain spurs which\r\nflank it, and with the dense, gloomy, steep, and forest-clad gorges\r\nof Sikkim. At its lower end, about twenty miles from the frontier, is\r\nthe military fort of Ilam, a celebrated stockaded post and cantonment\r\nof the Ghorkas: its position is marked by a conspicuous conical hill.\r\nThe inhabitants are chiefly Brahmins, but there are also some\r\nMoormis, and a few Lepchas who escaped from Sikkim during the general\r\nmassacre in 1825. Among these is a man who had formerly much\r\ninfluence in Sikkim; he still retains his title of Kazee,* [This\r\nMahometan title, by which the officers of state are known in Sikkim,\r\nis there generally pronounced Kajee.] and has had large lands\r\nassigned to him by the Nepalese Government: he sent the usual present\r\nof a kid, fowls, and eggs, and begged me to express to Dr. Campbell\r\nhis desire to return to his native country, and settle at Dorjiling.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of this valley is the most beautiful I know of in the\r\nlower Himalaya, and the Cheer Pine (_P. longifolia_) is abundant,\r\ncresting the hills; which are loosely clothed with clumps of oaks and\r\nother trees, bamboos, and bracken (_Pteris_). The slopes are covered\r\nwith red clay, and separate little ravines luxuriantly clothed with\r\ntropical vegetation, amongst which flow pebbly streams of transparent\r\ncool water. The villages, which are merely scattered collections of\r\nhuts, are surrounded with fields of rice, buckwheat, and Indian corn,\r\nwhich latter the natives were now storing in little granaries,\r\nmounted on four posts, men, women, and children being all equally\r\nbusy. The quantity of gigantic nettles (_Urtica heterophylla_) on the\r\nskirts of these maize fields is quite wonderful: their long white\r\nstings look most formidable, but though they sting virulently, the\r\npain only lasts half an hour or so. These, however, with leeches,\r\nmosquitos, peepsas, and ticks, sometimes keep the traveller in a\r\nconstant state of irritation.\r\n\r\nHowever civilised the Hindoo may be in comparison with the Lepcha, he\r\npresents a far less attractive picture to the casual observer; he\r\ncomes to your camping-ground, sits down, and stares with all his\r\nmight, but offers no assistance; if he bring a present at all, he\r\nexpects a return on the spot, and goes on begging till satisfied.\r\nI was amused by the cool way in which my Ghorka guard treated the\r\nvillage lads, when they wanted help in my service, taking them by the\r\nshoulder, pulling out their knives for them, placing them in their\r\nbands, and setting them to cut down a tree, or to chop firewood,\r\nwhich they seldom refused to do, when a little such douce violence\r\nwas applied.\r\n\r\nMy object being to reach the Tambur, north of the great east and west\r\nmountain ridge of Sakkiazung, without crossing the innumerable\r\nfeeders of the Myong and their dividing spurs, we ascended the north\r\nflank of the valley to a long spur from Tonglo, intending to follow\r\nwinding ridges of that mountain to the sources of the Pemmi at the\r\nPhulloot mountains, and thence descend.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd November I encamped on the flank of Tonglo (called Nanki\r\nin Nepal), at 9,300 feet, about 700 feet below the western summit,\r\nwhich is rocky, and connected by a long flat ridge with that which I\r\nhad visited in the previous May. The Bhotan coolies behaved worse\r\nthan ever; their conduct being in all respects typical of the\r\nturbulent, mulish race to which they belong. They had been plundering\r\nmy provisions as they went along, and neither their Sirdar nor the\r\nGhorka soldiers had the smallest authority over them. I had hired\r\nsome Ghorka coolies to assist and eventually to replace them, and had\r\nmade up my mind to send back the worst from the more populous banks\r\nof the Tambur, when I was relieved by their making off of their own\r\naccord. The dilemma was however awkward, as it was impossible to\r\nprocure men on the top of a mountain 10,000 feet high, or to proceed\r\ntowards Phulloot. No course remained but to send to Dorjiling for\r\nothers, or to return to the Myong valley, and take a more circuitous\r\nroute over the west end of Sakkiazung, which led through villages\r\nfrom which I could procure coolies day by day. I preferred the latter\r\nplan, and sent one of the soldiers to the nearest village for\r\nassistance to bring the loads down, halting a day for that purpose.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of Tonglo I enjoyed the view I had so long desired of\r\nthe Snowy Himalaya, from north-east to north-west; Sikkim being on\r\nthe right, Nepal on the left, and the plains of India to the\r\nsouthward; and I procured a set of compass bearings, of the greatest\r\nuse in mapping the country. In the early morning the transparency of\r\nthe atmosphere renders this view one of astonishing grandeur.\r\nKinchinjunga bore nearly due north, a dazzling mass of snowy peaks,\r\nintersected by blue glaciers, which gleamed in the slanting rays of\r\nthe rising sun, like aquamarines set in frosted silver. From this the\r\nsweep of snowed mountains to the eastward was almost continuous as\r\nfar as Chola (bearing east-north-east), following a curve of 150\r\nmiles, and enclosing the whole of the northern part of Sikkim, which\r\nappeared a billowy mass of forest-clad mountains. On the north-east\r\nhorizon rose the Donkia mountain (23,176 feet), and Chumulari\r\n(23,929). Though both were much more distant than the snowy ranges,\r\nbeing respectively eighty and ninety miles off, they raised their\r\ngigantic heads above, seeming what they really were, by far the\r\nloftiest peaks next to Kinchinjunga; and the perspective of snow is\r\nso deceptive, that though 40 to 60 miles beyond, they appeared as\r\nthough almost in the same line with the ridges they overtopped.\r\nOf these mountains, Chumulari presents many attractions to the\r\ngeographer, from its long disputed position, its sacred character,\r\nand the interest attached to it since Turner's mission to Tibet in\r\n1783. It was seen and recognised by Dr. Campbell, and measured by\r\nColonel Waugh, from Sinchul, and also from Tonglo, and was a\r\nconspicuous object in my subsequent journey to Tibet. Beyond Junnoo,\r\none of the western peaks of Kinchinjunga, there was no continuous\r\nsnowy chain; the Himalaya seemed suddenly to decline into black and\r\nrugged peaks, till in the far north-west it rose again in a white\r\nmountain mass of stupendous elevation at 80 miles distance, called,\r\nby my Nepal people, \"Tsungau.\"* [This is probably the easternmost and\r\nloftiest peak seen from Katmandoo, distant 78 miles, and estimated\r\nelevation 20,117 feet by Col. Crawford's observations. See\r\n\"Hamilton's Nepal,\" p. 346, and plate 1.] From the bearings I took of\r\nit from several positions, it is in about lat. 27 degrees 49 minutes\r\nand long. 86 degrees 24 minutes, and is probably on the west flank of\r\nthe Arun valley and river, which latter, in its course from Tibet to\r\nthe plains of India, receives the waters from the west flank of\r\nKinchinjunga, and from the east flank of the mountain in question.\r\nIt is perhaps one which has been seen and measured from the Tirhoot\r\ndistrict by some of Colonel Waugh's party, and which has been\r\nreported to be upwards of 28,000 feet in elevation; and it is the\r\nonly mountain of the first class in magnitude between Gosainthan\r\n(north-east of Katmandoo) and Kinchinjunga.\r\n\r\nTo the west, the black ridge of Sakkiazung, bristling with pines,\r\n(_Abies Webbiana_) cut off the view of Nepal; but south-west, the\r\nMyong valley could be traced to its junction with the Tambur about\r\nthirty miles off: beyond which to the south-west and south, low\r\nhills belonging to the outer ranges of Nepal rose on the distant\r\nhorizon, seventy or eighty miles off; and of these the most\r\nconspicuous were the Mahavarati which skirt the Nepal Terai. South\r\nand south-east, Sinchul and the Goong range of Sikkim intercepted the\r\nview of the plains of India, of which I had a distant peep to the\r\nsouth-west only.\r\n\r\nThe west top of Tonglo is very open and grassy, with occasional\r\nmasses of gneiss of enormous size, but probably not in situ.\r\nThe whole of this flank, and for 1000 feet down the spur to the\r\nsouth-west, had been cleared by fire for pasturage, and flocks of\r\nblack-faced sheep were grazing. During my stay on the mountain,\r\nexcept in the early morning, the weather was bleak, gloomy, and very\r\ncold, with a high south-west wind. The mean temperature was 41\r\ndegrees, extremes 53.2/26 degrees: the nights were very clear, with\r\nsharp hoar-frost; the radiating thermometer sank to 21 degrees, the\r\ntemperature at 3.5 feet depth was 51.5 degrees.\r\n\r\nA few of the Bhotan coolies having voluntarily returned, I left\r\nTonglo on the 5th, and descended its west flank to the Mai, a feeder\r\nof the Myong. The descent was as abrupt as that on the east face, but\r\nthrough less dense forest; the Sikkim side (that facing the east)\r\nbeing much the dampest. I encamped at dark by a small village,\r\n(Jummanoo) at 4,360 feet, having descended 5000 feet in five hours.\r\nHence we marched eastward to the village of Sakkiazung, which we\r\nreached on the third day, crossing _en route_ several spurs 4000 to\r\n6000 feet high, from the same ridge, and as many rivers, which all\r\nfall into the Myong, and whose beds are elevated from 2,500 to\r\n3000 feet.\r\n\r\nThough rich and fertile, the country is scantily populated, and\r\ncoolies were procured with difficulty: I therefore sent back to\r\nDorjiling all but absolute indispensables, and on the 9th of November\r\nstarted up the ridge in a northerly direction, taking the road from\r\nIlam to Wallanchoon. The ascent was gradual, through a fine forest,\r\nfull of horn-bills (_Buceros_), a bird resembling the Toucan\r\n(\"Dhunass\" Lepcha); at 7000 feet an oak (_Quercus semecarpifolia_),\r\n\"Khasrou\" of the Nepalese, commences, a tree which is common as far\r\nwest as Kashmir, but which I never found in Sikkim, though it appears\r\nagain in Bhotan.* [This oak ascends in the N.W. Himalaya to the\r\nhighest limit of forest (12,000 feet). No oak in Sikkim attains a\r\ngreater elevation than 10,000.] It forms a broad-headed tree, and has\r\na very handsome appearance; its favourite locality is on grassy open\r\nshoulders of the mountains. It was accompanied by an _Astragalus,\r\nGeranium,_ and several other plants of the drier interior parts of\r\nSikkim. Water is very scarce along the ridge; we walked fully eight\r\nmiles without finding any, and were at length obliged to encamp at\r\n8,350 feet by the only spring that we should be able to reach.\r\nWith respect to drought, this ridge differs materially from Sikkim,\r\nwhere water abounds at all elevations; and the cause is obviously its\r\nposition to the westward of the great ridge of Singalelah (including\r\nTonglo) by which the S.W. currents are drained of their moisture.\r\nHere again, the east flank was much the dampest and most\r\nluxuriantly wooded.\r\n\r\nWhile my men encamped on a very narrow ridge, I ascended a rocky\r\nsummit, composed of great blocks of gneiss, from which I obtained a\r\nsuperb view to the westward. Immediately below a fearfully sudden\r\ndescent, ran the Daomy River, bounded on the opposite side by another\r\nparallel ridge of Sakkiazung, enclosing, with that on which I stood,\r\na gulf from 6000 to 7000 feet deep, of wooded ridges, which, as it\r\nwere, radiated outwards as they ascended upwards in rocky spurs to\r\nthe pine-clad peaks around. To the south-west, in the extreme\r\ndistance, were the boundless plains of India, upwards of 100 miles\r\noff, with the Cosi meandering through them like a silver thread.\r\n\r\nThe firmament appeared of a pale steel blue, and a broad low arch\r\nspanned the horizon, bounded by a line of little fleecy clouds\r\n(moutons); below this the sky was of a golden yellow, while in\r\nsuccessively deeper strata, many belts or ribbons of vapour appeared\r\nto press upon the plains, the lowest of which was of a dark leaden\r\nhue, the upper more purple, and vanishing into the pale yellow above.\r\nThough well defined, there was no abrupt division between the belts,\r\nand the lowest mingled imperceptibly with the hazy horizon.\r\nGradually the golden lines grew dim, and the blues and purples gained\r\ndepth of colour; till the sun set behind the dark-blue peaked\r\nmountains in a flood of crimson and purple, sending broad beams of\r\ngrey shade and purple light up to the zenith, and all around.\r\nAs evening advanced, a sudden chill succeeded, and mists rapidly\r\nformed immediately below me in little isolated clouds, which\r\ncoalesced and spread out like a heaving and rolling sea, leaving\r\nnothing above their surface but the ridges and spurs of the adjacent\r\nmountains. These rose like capes, promontories, and islands, of the\r\ndarkest leaden hue, bristling with pines, and advancing boldly into\r\nthe snowy white ocean, or starting from its bed in the strongest\r\nrelief. As darkness came on, and the stars arose, a light fog\r\ngathered round me, and I quitted with reluctance one of the most\r\nimpressive and magic scenes I ever beheld.\r\n\r\nReturning to my tent, I was interested in observing how well my\r\nfollowers had accommodated themselves to their narrow circumstances.\r\nTheir fires gleamed everywhere amongst the trees, and the people,\r\nbroken up into groups of five, presented an interesting picture of\r\nnative, savage, and half-civilised life. I wandered amongst them in\r\nthe darkness, and watched unseen their operations; some were cooking,\r\nwith their rude bronzed faces lighted up by the ruddy glow, as they\r\npeered into the pot, stirring the boiling rice with one hand, while\r\nwith the other they held back their long tangled hair. Others were\r\nbringing water from the spring below, some gathering sprigs of\r\nfragrant _Artemisia_ and other shrubs to form couches--some lopping\r\nbranches of larger trees to screen them from nocturnal radiation;\r\ntheir only protection from the dew being such branches stuck in the\r\nground, and slanting over their procumbent forms. The Bhotanese were\r\nrude and boisterous in their pursuits, constantly complaining to the\r\nSirdars, and wrangling over their meals. The Ghorkas were sprightly,\r\ncombing their raven hair, telling interminably long stories, of which\r\nmoney was the burthen, or singing Hindoo songs through their noses in\r\nchorus; and being neater and better dressed, and having a servant to\r\ncook their food, they seemed quite the gentlemen of the party.\r\nStill the Lepcha was the most attractive, the least restrained, and\r\nthe most natural in all his actions, the simplest in his wants and\r\nappliances, with a bamboo as his water-jug, an earthen-pot as his\r\nkettle, and all manner of herbs collected during the day's march to\r\nflavour his food.\r\n\r\nMy tent was made of a blanket thrown over the limb of a tree; to this\r\nothers were attached, and the whole was supported on a frame like a\r\nhouse. One half was occupied by my bedstead, beneath which was stowed\r\nmy box of clothes, while my books and writing materials were placed\r\nunder the table. The barometer hung in the most out-of-the-way\r\ncorner, and my other instruments all around. A small candle was\r\nburning in a glass shade, to keep the draught and insects from the\r\nlight, and I had the comfort of seeing the knife, fork, and spoon\r\nlaid on a white napkin, as I entered my snug little house, and flung\r\nmyself on the elastic couch to ruminate on the proceedings of the\r\nday, and speculate on those of the morrow, while waiting for my meal,\r\nwhich usually consisted of stewed meat and rice, with biscuits and\r\ntea. My thermometers (wet and dry bulb, and minimum) hung under a\r\ntemporary canopy made of thickly plaited bamboo and leaves close to\r\nthe tent, and the cooking was performed by my servant under a tree.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner my occupations were to ticket and put away the plants\r\ncollected during the day, write up journals, plot maps, and take\r\nobservations till 10 p.m. As soon as I was in bed, one of the Nepal\r\nsoldiers was accustomed to enter, spread his blanket on the ground,\r\nand sleep there as my guard. In the morning the collectors were set\r\nto change the plant-papers, while I explored the neighbourhood, and\r\nhaving taken observations and breakfasted, we were ready to start at\r\n10 a.m.\r\n\r\nFollowing the same ridge, after a few miles of ascent over much\r\nbroken gneiss rock, the Ghorkas led me aside to the top of a knoll,\r\n9,300 feet high, covered with stunted bushes, and commanding a\r\nsplendid view to the west, of the broad, low, well cultivated valley\r\nof the Tambur, and the extensive town of Dunkotah on its banks, about\r\ntwenty-five miles off; the capital of this part of Nepal, and famous\r\nfor its manufactory of paper from the bark of the _Daphne._ Hence too\r\nI gained a fine view of the plains of India, including the course of\r\nthe Cosi river, which, receiving the Arun and Tambur, debouches into\r\nthe Ganges opposite Colgongl (see Chapter IV).\r\n\r\nA little further on we crossed the main ridge of Sakkiazung, a long\r\nflexuous chain stretching for miles to the westward from Phulloot on\r\nSingalelah, and forming the most elevated and conspicuous transverse\r\nrange in this part of Nepal: its streams flow south to the Myong, and\r\nnorth to feeders of the Tambur. Silver firs (_Abies Webbiana_) are\r\nfound on all the summits; but to my regret none occurred in our path,\r\nwhich led just below their limit (10,000 feet), on the southern\r\nHimalayan ranges. There were, however, a few yews, exactly like the\r\nEnglish. The view that opened on cresting this range was again\r\nmagnificent, of Kinchinjunga, the western snows of Nepal, and the\r\nvalley of the Tambur winding amongst wooded and cultivated hills to a\r\nlong line of black-peaked, rugged mountains, sparingly snowed, which\r\nintervene between Kinchinjunga and the great Nepal mountain before\r\nmentioned. The extremely varied colouring on the infinite number of\r\nhill-slopes that everywhere intersected the Tambur valley was very\r\npleasing. For fully forty miles to the northward there were no lofty\r\nforest-clad mountains, nor any apparently above 4000 to 5000 feet:\r\nvillages and hamlets appeared everywhere, with crops of golden\r\nmustard and purple buckwheat in full flower; yellow rice and maize,\r\ngreen hemp, pulse, radishes, and barley, and brown millet. Here and\r\nthere deep groves of oranges, the broad-leafed banana, and\r\nsugar-cane, skirted the bottoms of the valleys, through which the\r\nstreams were occasionally seen, rushing in white foam over their\r\nrocky beds. It was a goodly sight to one who had for his only\r\nstandard of comparison the view from Sinchul, of the gloomy\r\nforest-clad ranges of 6000 to 10,000 feet, that intervene between\r\nthat mountain and the snowy girdle of Sikkim; though I question\r\nwhether a traveller from more favoured climes would see more in this,\r\nthan a thinly inhabited country, with irregular patches of poor\r\ncultivation, a vast amount of ragged forest on low hills of rather\r\nuniform height and contour, relieved by a dismal back-ground of\r\nfrowning black mountains, sprinkled with snow! Kinchinjunga was again\r\nthe most prominent object to the north-east, with its sister peaks of\r\nKubra (24,005 feet), and Junnoo (25,312 feet). All these presented\r\nbare cliff's for several thousand feet below their summits, composed\r\nof white rock with a faint pink tint:--on the other hand the lofty\r\nNepal mountain in the far west presented cliffs of black rocks. From\r\nthe summit two routes to the Tambur presented themselves; one, the\r\nmain road, led west and south along the ridge, and then turned north,\r\ndescending to the river; the other was shorter, leading abruptly down\r\nto the Pemmi river, and thence along its banks, west to the Tambur.\r\nI chose the latter.\r\n\r\nThe descent was very abrupt on the first day, from 9,500 feet to 5000\r\nfeet, and on that following to the bed of the Pemmi, at 2000 feet;\r\nand the road was infamously bad, generally consisting of a narrow,\r\nwinding, rocky path among tangled shrubs and large boulders,\r\nbrambles, nettles, and thorny bushes, often in the bed of the\r\ntorrent, or crossing spurs covered with forest, round whose bases it\r\nflowed. A little cultivation was occasionally met with on the narrow\r\nflat pebbly terraces which fringed the stream, usually of rice, and\r\nsometimes of the small-leaved variety of hemp (_Cannabis_), grown as\r\na narcotic.\r\n\r\nThe rocks above 5000 feet were gneiss; below this, cliffs of very\r\nmicaceous schist were met with, having a north-west strike, and being\r\noften vertical; the boulders again were always of gneiss. The streams\r\nseemed rather to occupy faults, than to have eroded courses for\r\nthemselves; their beds were invariably rocky or pebbly, and the\r\nwaters white and muddy from the quantity of alumina. In one little\r\nrocky dell the water gushed through a hole in a soft stratum in the\r\ngneiss; a trifling circumstance which was not lost upon the crafty\r\nBrahmins, who had cut a series of regular holes for the water,\r\nornamented the rocks with red paint, and a row of little iron\r\ntridents of Siva, and dedicated the whole to Mahadeo.\r\n\r\nIn some spots the vegetation was exceedingly fine, and several large\r\ntrees occurred: I measured a Toon (_Cedrela_) thirty feet in girth at\r\nfive feet above the ground. The skirts of the forest were adorned\r\nwith numerous jungle flowers, rice crops, blue _Acanthaceae_ and\r\n_Pavetta,_ wild cherry-trees covered with scarlet blossoms, and trees\r\nof the purple and lilac _Bauhinia_; while _Thunbergia, Convolvulus,_\r\nand other climbers, hung in graceful festoons from the boughs, and on\r\nthe dry micaceous rocks the _Luculia gratissima,_ one of our common\r\nhot-house ornaments, grew in profusion, its gorgeous heads of\r\nblossoms scenting the air.\r\n\r\nAt the junction of the Pemmi and Khawa rivers, there are high rocks\r\nof mica-slate, and broad river-terraces of stratified sand and\r\npebbles, apparently alternating with deposits of shingle. On this\r\nhot, open expanse, elevated 2250 feet, appeared many trees and plants\r\nof the Terai and plains, as pomegranate, peepul, and sal; with\r\nextensive fields of cotton, indigo, and irrigated rice.\r\n\r\nWe followed the north bank of the Khawa, which runs westerly through\r\na gorge, between high cliffs of chlorite, containing thick beds of\r\nstratified quartz. At the angles of the river broad terraces are\r\nformed, fifteen to thirty feet above its bed, similar to those just\r\nmentioned, and planted with rows of _Acacia Serissa,_ or laid out in\r\nrice fields, or sugar plantations.\r\n\r\nI reached the east bank of the Tambur, on the 13th of November, at\r\nits junction with the Khawa, in a deep gorge. It formed a grand\r\nstream, larger than the Teesta, of a pale, sea-green, muddy colour,\r\nand flowed rapidly with a strong ripple, but no foam; it rises six\r\nfeet in the rains, but ice never descends nearly so low; its breadth\r\nwas sixty to eighty yards, its temperature 55 degrees to 58 degrees.\r\nThe breadth of the foaming Khawa was twelve to fifteen yards, and its\r\ntemperature 56.5 degrees. The surrounding vegetation was entirely\r\ntropical, consisting of scrubby sal trees, acacia, _Grislea, Emblica,\r\nHibiscus,_ etc.; the elevation being but 1300 feet, though the spot\r\nwas twenty-five miles in a straight line from the plains. I camped at\r\nthe fork of the rivers, on a fine terrace fifty feet above the water,\r\nabout seventy yards long, and one hundred broad, quite flat-topped,\r\nand composed of shingle, gravel, etc., with enormous boulders of\r\ngneiss, quartz, and hornstone, much water-worn; it was girt by\r\nanother broken terrace, twelve feet or so above the water, and\r\ncovered with long grass and bushes.\r\n\r\nThe main road from Ilam to Wallanchoon, which I quitted on\r\nSakkiazung, descends steeply on the opposite bank of the river, which\r\nI crossed in a canoe formed of a hollow trunk (of Toon), thirty feet\r\nlong. There is considerable traffic along this road; and I was\r\nvisited by numbers of natives, all Hindoos, who coolly squatted\r\nbefore my tent-door, and stared with their large black, vacant,\r\nlustrous eyes: they appear singularly indolent, and great beggars.\r\n\r\nThe land seems highly favoured by nature, and the population, though\r\nso scattered, is in reality considerable, the varied elevation giving\r\na large surface; but the natives care for no more than will satisfy\r\ntheir immediate wants. The river swarms with fish, but they are too\r\nlazy to catch them, and they have seldom anything better to give or\r\nsell than sticks of sugar-cane, which when peeled form a refreshing\r\nmorsel in these scorching marches. They have few and poor oranges,\r\ncitrons, and lemons, very bad plantains, and but little else;--eggs,\r\nfowls, and milk are all scarce. Horned cattle are of course never\r\nkilled by Hindoos, and it was but seldom that I could replenish my\r\nlarder with a kid. Potatos are unknown, but my Sepoys often brought\r\nme large coarse radishes and legumes.\r\n\r\nFrom the junction of the rivers the road led up the Tambur to Mywa\r\nGuola; about sixteen miles by the river, but fully thirty-five, as we\r\nwound, ascended, and descended, during three days' marches. We were\r\nferried across the stream in a canoe much ruder than that of the New\r\nZealander. I watched my party crossing by boat-loads of fifteen each;\r\nthe Bhotan men hung little scraps of rags on the bushes before\r\nembarking, the votive offerings of a Booddhist throughout central\r\nAsia;--the Lepcha, less civilised, scooped up a little water in the\r\npalm of his hand, and scattered it about, invoking the river god of\r\nhis simple creed.\r\n\r\nWe always encamped upon gravelly terraces a few feet above the river,\r\nwhich flows in a deep gorge; its banks are very steep for 600 feet\r\nabove the stream, though the mountains which flank it do not exceed\r\n4000 to 5000 feet: this is a constant phenomenon in the Himalaya, and\r\nthe roads, when low and within a few hundred feet of the river, are\r\nin consequence excessively steep and difficult; it would have been\r\nimpossible to have taken ponies along that we followed, which was\r\noften not a foot broad, running along very steep cliffs, at a dizzy\r\nheight above the river, and engineered with much trouble and\r\ningenuity: often the bank was abandoned altogether, and we ascended\r\nseveral thousand feet to descend again. Owing to the steepness of\r\nthese banks, and the reflected heat, the valley, even at this season,\r\nwas excessively hot and close during the day, even when the\r\ntemperature was below 70 degrees, and tempered by a brisk breeze\r\nwhich rushes upwards from sunrise to sunset. The sun at this season\r\ndoes not, in many places, reach the bottom of these valleys until 10\r\na.m., and is off again by 3 p.m.; and the radiation to a clear sky is\r\nso powerful that dew frequently forms in the shade, throughout the\r\nday, and it is common at 10 a.m. to find the thermometer sink from 70\r\ndegrees in a sheltered spot, dried by the sun, to 40 degrees in the\r\nshade close by, where the sun has not yet penetrated. Snow never\r\nfalls.\r\n\r\nThe rocks throughout this part of the river-course are mica-schists\r\n(strike north-west, dip south-west 70 degrees, but very variable in\r\ninclination and direction); they are dry and grassy, and the\r\nvegetation wholly tropical, as is the entomology, which consists\r\nchiefly of large butterflies, _Mantis_ and _Diptera._ Snowy mountains\r\nare rarely seen, and the beauty of the scenery is confined to the\r\nwooded banks of the main stream, which flows at an average\r\ninclination of fifty feet to the mile. Otters are found in the\r\nstream, and my party shot two, but could not procure them.\r\n\r\nIllustration--TAMBUR RIVER & VALLEY (EAST NEPAL) FROM CHINTAM.\r\n(ELEVATION 5000 FT.) LOOKING NORTH.\r\n\r\nIn one place the road ascended for 2000 feet above the river, to the\r\nvillage of Chingtam, situated on a lofty spur of the west bank,\r\nwhence I obtained a grand view of the upper course of the river,\r\nflowing in a tremendous chasm, flanked by well-cultivated hills, and\r\nemerging fifteen miles to the northward, from black mountains of\r\nsavage grandeur, whose rugged, precipitous faces were streaked with\r\nsnow, and the tops of the lower ones crowned with the\r\ntabular-branched silver-fir, contrasting strongly with the tropical\r\nluxuriance around. Chingtam is an extensive village, covering an area\r\nof two miles, and surrounded with abundant cultivation; the houses,\r\nwhich are built in clusters, are of wood, or wattle and mud, with\r\ngrass thatch. The villagers, though an indolent, staring race, are\r\nquiet and respectable; the men are handsome, the women, though less\r\nso, often good-looking. They have fine cattle, and excellent crops.\r\n\r\nImmediately above Chingtam, the Tambur is joined by a large affluent\r\nfrom the west, the Mywa, which is crossed by an excellent iron\r\nbridge, formed of loops hanging from two parallel chains, along which\r\nis laid a plank of sal timber. Passing through the village, we camped\r\non a broad terrace, from sixty to seventy feet above the junction of\r\nthe rivers, whose beds are 2100 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nMywa Guola (or bazaar) is a large village and mart, frequented by\r\nNepalese and Tibetans, who bring salt, wool, gold, musk, and\r\nblankets, to exchange for rice, coral, and other commodities; and a\r\ncustom-house officer is stationed there, with a few soldiers.\r\nThe houses are of wood, and well built: the public ones are large,\r\nwith verandahs, and galleries of carved wood; the workmanship is of\r\nChinese character, and inferior to that of Katmandoo; but in the same\r\nstyle, and quite unlike anything I had previously seen.\r\n\r\nThe river-terrace is in all respects similar to that at the junction\r\nof the Tambur and Khawa, but very extensive: the stones it contained\r\nwere of all sizes, from a nut to huge boulders upwards of fifteen\r\nfeet long, of which many strewed the surface, while others were in\r\nthe bed of the river: all were of gneiss, quartz, and granite, and\r\nhad doubtless been transported from great elevations, as the rocks\r\n_in situ_--both here and for several thousand feet higher up the\r\nriver--were micaceous schists, dipping in various directions, and at\r\nall angles, with, however, a general strike to the north-west.\r\n\r\nI was here overtaken by a messenger with letters from Dr. Campbell,\r\nannouncing that the Sikkim Rajah had disavowed the refusal to the\r\nGovernor-General's letter, and authorising me to return through any\r\npart of Sikkim I thought proper. The bearer was a Lepcha attached to\r\nthe court: his dress was that of a superior person, being a scarlet\r\njacket over a white cotton dress, the breadth of the blue stripes of\r\nwhich generally denotes wealth; he was accompanied by a sort of\r\nattache, who wore a magnificent pearl and gold ear-ring, and carried\r\nhis master's bow, as well as a basket on his back; while an attendant\r\ncoolie bore their utensils and food. Meepo, or Teshoo (in Tibetan,\r\nMr.), Meepo, as he was usually called, soon attached himself to me,\r\nand proved an active, useful, and intelligent companion, guide, and\r\noften collector, during many months afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation round Mywa Guola is still thoroughly tropical: the\r\nbanyan is planted, and thrives tolerably, the heat being great during\r\nthe day. Like the whole of the Tambur valley below 4000 feet, and\r\nespecially on these flats, the climate is very malarious before and\r\nafter the rains; and I was repeatedly applied to by natives suffering\r\nunder attacks of fever. During the two days I halted, the mean\r\ntemperature was 60 degrees (extremes, 80/41 degrees), that of the\r\nTambur, 53 degrees, and of the Mywa, 56 degrees; each varying a few\r\ndegrees (the smaller stream the most) between sunrise and 4 p.m.: the\r\nsunk thermometer was 72 degrees.\r\n\r\nAs we should not easily be able to procure food further on, I laid in\r\na full stock here, and distributed blankets, etc., sufficient for\r\ntemporary use for all the people, dividing them into groups or messes.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nLeave Mywa -- Suspension bridge -- Landslips -- Vegetation -- Slope\r\nof riverbed -- Bees' nests -- Glacial phenomena -- Tibetans,\r\nclothing, ornaments, amulets, salutation, children, dogs -- Last\r\nLimboo village, Taptiatok -- Beautiful scenery -- Tibet village of\r\nLelyp -- _Opuntia_ -- _Edgeworthia_ -- Crab-apple -- Chameleon and\r\nporcupine -- Praying machine -- _Abies Brunoniana_ -- European plants\r\n-- Grand scenery -- Arrive at Wallanchoon -- Scenery around -- Trees\r\n-- Tibet houses -- Manis and Mendongs -- Tibet household -- Food --\r\nTea-soup -- Hospitality -- Yaks and Zobo, uses and habits of --\r\nBhoteeas -- Yak-hair tents -- Guobah of Walloong -- Jhatamansi --\r\nObstacles to proceeding -- Climate and weather -- Proceed --\r\nRhododendrons, etc. -- Lichens -- _Poa annua_ and Shepherd's purse --\r\nTibet camp -- Tuquoroma -- Scenery of pass -- Glaciers and snow --\r\nSummit -- Plants, woolly, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th November, we left Mywa Guola, and continued up the river\r\nto the village of Wallanchoon or Walloong, which was reached in six\r\nmarches. The snowy peak of Junnoo (alt. 25,312 feet.) forms a\r\nmagnificent feature from this point, seen up the narrow gorge of the\r\nriver, bearing N.N.E. about thirty miles. I crossed the Mewa, an\r\naffluent from the north, by another excellent suspension bridge.\r\nIn these bridges, the principal chains are clamped to rocks on either\r\nshore, and the suspended loops occur at intervals of eight to ten\r\nfeet; the single sal-plank laid on these loops swings terrifically,\r\nand the handrails not being four feet high, the sense of insecurity\r\nis very great.\r\n\r\nThe Wallanchoon road follows the west bank, but the bridge above\r\nhaving been carried away, we crossed by a plank, and proceeded along\r\nvery steep banks of decomposed chlorite schist, much contorted, and\r\nvery soapy, affording an insecure footing, especially where great\r\nlandslips had occurred, which were numerous, exposing acres of a\r\nreddish and white soil of felspathic clay, sloping at an angle of 30\r\ndegrees. Where the angle was less than 15 degrees, rice was\r\ncultivated, and partially irrigated. The lateral streams (of a muddy\r\nopal green) had cut beds 200 feet deep in the soft earth, and were\r\nvery troublesome to cross, from the crumbling cliffs on either side,\r\nand their broad swampy channels.\r\n\r\nFive or six miles above Mywa, the valley contracts much, and the\r\nTambur (whose bed is elevated about 3000 feet) becomes a turbulent\r\nriver, shooting along its course with immense velocity, torn into\r\nfoam as it lashes the spurs of rock that flank it, and the enormous\r\nboulders with which its bed is strewn.* [In some places torrents of\r\nstone were carried down by landslips, obstructing the rivers; when in\r\nthe beds of streams, they were often cemented by felspathic clay into\r\na hard breccia of angular quartz, gneiss, and felspar nodules.] From\r\nthis elevation to 9000 feet, its sinuous track extends about thirty\r\nmiles, which gives the mean fall of 200 feet to the mile, quadruple\r\nof what it is for the lower part of its course. So long as its bed is\r\nbelow 5000 feet, a tropical vegetation prevails in the gorge, and\r\nalong the terraces, consisting of tall bamboo, _Bauhinia, Acacia,\r\nMelastoma,_ etc.; but the steep mountain sides above are either bare\r\nand grassy, or cliffs with scattered shrubs and trees, and their\r\nsummits are of splintered slaty gneiss, bristling with pines: those\r\nfaces exposed to the south and east are invariably the driest and\r\nmost grassy; while the opposite are well wooded. _Rhododendron\r\narboreum_ becomes plentiful at 5000 to 6000 feet, forming a large\r\ntree on dry clayey slopes; it is accompanied by _Indigofera,\r\nAndromeda,_ _Spiraea,_ shrubby _Compositae,_ and very many plants\r\nabsent at similar elevations on the wet outer Dorjiling ranges.\r\n\r\nIn the contracted parts of the valley, the mountains often dip to the\r\nriver-bed, in precipices of gneiss, under the ledges of which wild\r\nbees build pendulous nests, looking like huge bats suspended by their\r\nwings; they are two or three feet long, and as broad at the top,\r\nwhence they taper downwards: the honey is much sought for, except in\r\nspring, when it is said to be poisoned by Rhododendron flowers, just\r\nas that, eaten by the soldiers in the retreat of the Ten Thousand,\r\nwas by the flowers of the _R. ponticum._\r\n\r\nAbove these gorges are enormous accumulations of rocks, especially at\r\nthe confluence of lateral valleys, where they rest upon little flats,\r\nlike the river-terraces of Mywa, but wholly formed of angular\r\nshingle, flanked with beds of river-formed gravel: some of these\r\nboulders were thirty or forty yards across, and split as if they had\r\nfallen from a height; the path passing between the fragments.* [The\r\nsplit fragments I was wholly unable to account for, till my attention\r\nwas directed by Mr. Darwin to the observations of Charpentier and\r\nAgassiz, who refer similar ones met with in the Alps, to rocks which\r\nhave fallen through crevasses in glaciers.--See \"Darwin on Glaciers\r\nand Transported Boulders in North Wales.\" London, \"Phil. Mag.\" xxi.\r\np. 180.] At first I imagined that they had been precipitated from the\r\nmountains around; and I referred the shingle to land-shoots, which\r\nduring the rains descend several thousand feet in devastating\r\navalanches, damming up the rivers, and destroying houses, cattle, and\r\ncultivation; but though I still refer the materials of many such\r\nterraces to this cause, I consider those at the mouths of valleys to\r\nbe due to ancient glacial action, especially when laden with such\r\nenormous blocks as are probably ice-transported.\r\n\r\nA change in the population accompanies that in the natural features\r\nof the country, Tibetans replacing the Limboos and Khass-tribes of\r\nNepal, who inhabit the lower region. We daily passed parties of ten\r\nor a dozen Tibetans, on their way to Mywa Guola, laden with salt;\r\nseveral families of these wild, black, and uncouth-looking people\r\ngenerally travelling together. The men are middle-sized, often tall,\r\nvery square-built and muscular; they have no beard, moustache, or\r\nwhiskers, the few hairs on their faces being carefully removed with\r\ntweezers. They are dressed in loose blanket robes, girt about the\r\nwaist with a leather belt, in which they place their iron or brass\r\npipes, and from which they suspend their long knives, chopsticks,\r\ntobacco-pouch, tweezers, tinder-box, etc. The robe, boots, and cap\r\nare grey, or striped with bright colours, and they wear skull-caps,\r\nand the hair plaited into a pig-tail.\r\n\r\nThe women are dressed in long flannel petticoats and spencer, over\r\nwhich is thrown a sleeveless, short, striped cloak, drawn round the\r\nwaist by a girdle of broad brass or silver links, to which hang their\r\nknives, scissors, needlecases, etc., and with which they often strap\r\ntheir children to their backs; the hair is plaited in two tails, and\r\nthe neck loaded with strings of coral and glass beads, and great\r\nlumps of amber, glass, and agate. Both sexes wear silver rings and\r\near-rings, set with turquoises, and square amulets upon their necks\r\nand arms, which are boxes of gold or silver, containing small idols,\r\nor the nail-parings, teeth, or other reliques of some sainted Lama,\r\naccompanied with musk, written prayers, and other charms. All are\r\ngood-humoured and amiable-looking people, very square and Mongolian\r\nin countenance, with broad mouths, high cheek-bones, narrow, upturned\r\neyes, broad, flat noses, and low foreheads. White is their natural\r\ncolour, and rosy cheeks are common amongst the younger women and\r\nchildren, but all are begrimed with filth and smoke; added to which,\r\nthey become so weather-worn from exposure to the most rigorous\r\nclimate in the world, that their natural hues are rarely to be\r\nrecognised. Their customary mode of saluting one another is to hold\r\nout the tongue, grin, nod, and scratch their ear; but this method\r\nentails so much ridicule in the low countries, that they do not\r\npractise it to Nepalese or strangers; most of them when meeting me,\r\non the contrary, raised their hands to their eyes, threw themselves\r\non the ground, and kotowed most decorously, bumping their foreheads\r\nthree times on the ground; even the women did this on several\r\noccasions. On rising, they begged for a bucksheesh, which I gave in\r\ntobacco or snuff, of which they are immoderately fond. Both men and\r\nwomen constantly spin wool as they travel.\r\n\r\nIllustration--TIBET MASTIFF.\r\n\r\nThese motley groups of Tibetans are singularly picturesque, from the\r\nvariety in their parti-coloured dresses, and their odd appearance.\r\nFirst comes a middle-aged man or woman, driving a little silky black\r\nyak, grunting under his load of 260 lb. of salt, besides pots, pans,\r\nand kettles, stools, churn, and bamboo vessels, keeping up a constant\r\nrattle, and perhaps, buried amongst all, a rosy-cheeked and lipped\r\nbaby, sucking a lump of cheese-curd. The main body follow in due\r\norder, and you are soon entangled amidst sheep and goats, each with\r\nits two little bags of salt: beside these, stalks the huge, grave,\r\nbull-headed mastiff, loaded like the rest, his glorious bushy tail\r\nthrown over his back in a majestic sweep, and a thick collar of\r\nscarlet wool round his neck and shoulders, setting off his long silky\r\ncoat to the best advantage; he is decidedly the noblest-looking of\r\nthe party, especially if a fine and pure black one, for they are\r\noften very ragged, dun-coloured, sorry beasts. He seems rather out of\r\nplace, neither guarding nor keeping the party together, but he knows\r\nthat neither yaks, sheep, nor goats, require his attention; all are\r\nperfectly tame, so he takes his share of work as salt-carrier by day,\r\nand watches by night as well. The children bring up the rear,\r\nlaughing and chatting together; they, too, have their loads, even to\r\nthe youngest that can walk alone.\r\n\r\nThe last village of the Limboos, Taptiatok, is large, and occupies a\r\nremarkable amphitheatre, apparently a lake-bed, in the course of the\r\nTambur. After proceeding some way through a narrow gorge, along which\r\nthe river foamed and roared, the sudden opening out of this broad,\r\noval expanse, more than a mile long, was very striking: the mountains\r\nrose bare and steep, the west flank terminating in shivered masses of\r\nrock, while that on the right was more undulating, dry, and grassy:\r\nthe surface was a flat gravel-bed, through which meandered the\r\nrippling stream, fringed with alder. It was a beautiful spot, the\r\nclear, cool, murmuring river, with its rapids and shallows, forcibly\r\nreminding me of trout-streams in the highlands of Scotland.\r\n\r\nBeyond Taptiatok we again crossed the river, and ascended over dry,\r\ngrassy, or rocky spurs to Lelyp, the first Bhoteea village; it stands\r\non a hill fully 1000 feet above the river, and commands a splendid\r\nview up the Yalloong and Kambachen valleys, which open immediately to\r\nthe east, and appear as stupendous chasms in the mountains leading to\r\nthe perpetual snows of Kinchin-junga. There were about fifty houses\r\nin the village, of wood and thatch, neatly fenced in with wattle, the\r\nground between being carefully cultivated with radishes, buckwheat,\r\nwheat, and millet. I was surprised to find in one enclosure a fine\r\nhealthy plant of _Opuntia,_ in flower, at this latitude and\r\nelevation. A Lama, who is the head man of the place, came out to\r\ngreet us, with his family and a whole troop of villagers; they were\r\nthe same class of people as I have elsewhere described as Cis-nivean\r\nTibetans, or Bhoteeas; none had ever before seen an Englishman, and I\r\nfear they formed no flattering opinion from the specimen now\r\npresented to them, as they seemed infinitely amused at my appearance,\r\nand one jolly dame clapped her hands to her sides, and laughed at my\r\nspectacles, till the hills echoed.\r\n\r\n_Elaeagnus_ was common here, with _Edgeworthia Gardneri,_* [A plant\r\nallied to _Daphne,_ from whose bark the Nepal paper is manufactured.\r\nIt was named after the eminent Indian botanist, brother of the late\r\nMiss Edgeworth.] a beautiful shrub, with globes of waxy,\r\ncowslip-coloured, deliciously scented flowers; also a wild apple,\r\nwhich bears a small austere fruit, like the Siberian crab. In the bed\r\nof the river rice was still cultivated by Limboos, and subtropical\r\nplants continued. I saw, too, a chameleon and a porcupine, indicating\r\nmuch warmth, and seeming quite foreign to the heart of these\r\nstupendous mountains. From 6000 to 7000 feet, plants of the temperate\r\nregions blend with the tropical; such as rhododendron, oak, ivy,\r\ngeranium, berberry, clematis, and shrubby _Vaccinia,_ which all made\r\ntheir appearance at Loongtoong, another Bhoteea village. Here, too, I\r\nfirst saw a praying machine, turned by water; it was enclosed in a\r\nlittle wooden house, and consisted of an upright cylinder containing\r\na prayer, and with the words, \"Om mani padmi om,\" (Hail to him of the\r\nLotus and Jewel) painted on the circumference: it was placed over a\r\nstream, and made to rotate on its axis by a spindle which passed\r\nthrough the floor of the building into the water, and was terminated\r\nby a wheel.\r\n\r\nAbove this the road followed the west bank of the river; the latter\r\nwas a furious torrent, flowing through a gorge, fringed with a sombre\r\nvegetation, damp, and dripping with moisture, and covered with long\r\n_Usnea_ and pendulous mosses. The road was very rocky and difficult,\r\nsometimes leading along bluff faces of cliffs by wooden steps and\r\nsingle rotten planks. At 8000 feet I met with pines, whose trunks I\r\nhad seen strewing the river for some miles lower down: the first that\r\noccurred was _Abies Brunoniana,_ a beautiful species, which forms a\r\nstately blunt pyramid, with branches spreading like the cedar, but\r\nnot so stiff, and drooping gracefully on all sides. It is unknown on\r\nthe outer ranges of Sikkim, and in the interior occupies a belt about\r\n1000 feet lower than the silver fir (_A. Webbiana_). Many sub-alpine\r\nplants occur here, as _Lecesteria, Thalictrum,_ rose, thistles,\r\nalder, birch, ferns, berberry, holly, anemone, strawberry, raspberry,\r\n_Gnaphalium, the alpine bamboo, and oaks. The scenery is as grand as\r\nany pictured by Salvator Rosa; a river roaring in sheets of foam,\r\nsombre woods, crags of gneiss, and tier upon tier of lofty mountains\r\nflanked and crested with groves of black firs, terminating in\r\nsnow-sprinkled rocky peaks.\r\n\r\nIllustration--TAMBUR RIVER AT THE LOWER LIMIT OF PINES.\r\n\r\nI now found the temperature getting rapidly cooler, both that of the\r\nair, which here at 8,066 feet fell to 32 degrees in the night, and\r\nthat of the river, which was always below 40 degrees. It was in these\r\nnarrow valleys only, that I observed the return cold current rushing\r\ndown the river-courses during the nights, which were usually\r\nbrilliant and very cold, with copious dew: so powerful, indeed, was\r\nthe radiation, that the upper blanket of my bed became coated with\r\nmoisture, from the rapid abstraction of heat by the frozen tarpaulin\r\nof my tent.\r\n\r\nThe rivers here are often fringed by flats of shingle, on which grow\r\nmagnificent yews and pines; some of the latter were from 120 to 150\r\nfeet high, and had been blown down, owing to their scanty hold on the\r\nsoil. I measured one, _Abies Brunoniana,_ twenty feet in girth.\r\nMany alpine rhododendrons occur at 9000 feet, with _Astragalis_ and\r\ncreeping Tamarisk. Three miles below Wallanchoon the river forks,\r\nbeing met by the Yangma from the north-east; they are impetuous\r\ntorrents of about equal volume; the Tambur especially (here called\r\nthe Walloong) is often broken into cascades, and cuts a deep\r\ngorge-like channel.\r\n\r\nI arrived at the village of Wallanchoon on the 23rd of November.\r\nIt is elevated 10,385 feet, and situated in a fine open part of the\r\nTambur valley, differing from any part lower down in all its natural\r\nfeatures; being broad, with a rapid but not turbulent stream, very\r\ngrassy, and both the base and sides of the flanking mountains covered\r\nwith luxuriant dense bushes of rhododendron, rose, berberry and\r\njuniper. Red-legged crows, hawks, wild pigeons, and finches,\r\nabounded. There was but little snow on the mountains around, which\r\nare bare and craggy above, but sloping below. Bleak and forbidding as\r\nthe situation of any Himalayan village at 10,000 feet elevation must\r\nbe, that of Wallanchoon is rendered the more so from the\r\ncomparatively few trees; for though the silver fir and juniper are\r\nboth abundant higher up the valley, they have been felled here for\r\nbuilding materials, fuel, and export to Tibet. From the naked limbs\r\nand tall gaunt black trunks of those that remain, stringy masses of\r\nbleached lichen (_Usnea_) many feet long, stream in the wind.\r\nBoth men and women seemed fond of decorating their hair with wreaths\r\nof this lichen, which they dye yellow with leaves of _Symplocos._\r\n\r\nIllustration--WALLANCHOON VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nThe village is very large, and occupies a flat on the east bank of\r\nthe river, covered with huge boulders: the ascent to it is extremely\r\nsteep, probably over an ancient moraine, though I did not recognise\r\nit as such at the time. Cresting this, the valley at once opens, and\r\nI was almost startled with the sudden change from a gloomy gorge to a\r\nbroad flat and a populous village of large and good painted wooden\r\nhouses, ornamented with hundreds of long poles and vertical flags,\r\nlooking like the fleet of some foreign port; while a swarm of\r\ngood-natured, intolerably dirty Tibetans, were kotowing to me as\r\nI advanced.\r\n\r\nThe houses crept up the base of the mountain, on the flank of which\r\nwas a very large, long convent; two-storied, and painted scarlet,\r\nwith a low black roof, and backed by a grove of dark junipers; while\r\nthe hill-sides around were thickly studded with bushes of deep green\r\nrhododendron, scarlet berberry, and withered yellow rose. The village\r\ncontained about one hundred houses, irregularly crowded together,\r\nfrom twenty to forty feet high, and forty to eighty feet long; each\r\naccommodating several families. All were built of upright strong\r\npine-planks, the interstices of which were filled with yak-dung; and\r\nthey sometimes rest on a low foundation wall: the door was generally\r\nat the gable end; it opened with a latch and string; and turned on a\r\nwooden pivot; the only window was a slit closed by a shutter; and the\r\nroofs were very low-pitched, covered with shingles kept down by\r\nstones. The paths were narrow and filthy; and the only public\r\nbuildings besides the convents were Manis and Mendongs; of these the\r\nformer are square-roofed temples, containing rows of praying-\r\ncylinders placed close together, from four to six feet high,\r\nand gaudily painted; some are turned by hand, and others by water:\r\nthe latter are walls ornamented with slabs of clay and mica slate,\r\nwith \"Om Mani Padmi om\" well carved on them in two characters, and\r\nrepeated _ad infinitum._\r\n\r\nA Tibetan household is very slovenly; the family live higgledy-\r\npiggledy in two or more apartments, the largest of which has an open\r\nfire on the earth, or on a stone if the floor be of wood. The pots\r\nand tea-pot are earthen and copper; and these, with the bamboo\r\nchurn for the brick tea, some wooden and metal spoons, bowls, and\r\nplatters, comprise all the kitchen utensils.\r\n\r\nEvery one carries in the breast of his robe a little wooden cup for\r\ndaily use; neatly turned from the knotted roots of maple (see Chapter\r\nV). The Tibetan chiefly consumes barley, wheat, or buckwheat\r\nmeal--the latter is confined to the poorer classes--with milk,\r\nbutter, curd, and parched wheat; fowls, eggs, pork, and yak flesh\r\nwhen he can afford it, and radishes, a few potatos, legumes, and\r\nturnips in their short season. His drink is a sort of soup made from\r\nbrick tea, of which a handful of leaves is churned up with salt,\r\nbutter, and soda, then boiled and transferred to the tea-pot, whence\r\nit is poured scalding hot into each cup, which the good woman of the\r\nhouse keeps incessantly replenishing, and urging you to drain.\r\nSometimes, but more rarely, the Tibetans make a drink by pouring\r\nboiling water over malt, as the Lepchas do over millet. A pipe of\r\nyellow mild Chinese tobacco generally follows the meal; more often,\r\nhowever, their tobacco is brought from the plains of India, when it\r\nis of a very inferior description. The pipe carried in the girdle, is\r\nof brass or iron, often with an agate, amber, or bamboo mouth-piece.\r\n\r\nMany herds of fine yaks were grazing about Wallanchoon: there were a\r\nfew ponies, sheep, goats, fowls, and pigs, but very little\r\ncultivation except turnips, radishes, and potatos. The yak is a very\r\ntame, domestic animal, often handsome, and a true bison in\r\nappearance; it is invaluable to these mountaineers from its strength\r\nand hardiness, accomplishing, at a slow pace, twenty miles a day,\r\nbearing either two bags of salt or rice, or four to six planks of\r\npinewood slung in pairs along either flank. Their ears are generally\r\npierced, and ornamented with a tuft of scarlet worsted; they have\r\nlarge and beautiful eyes, spreading horns, long silky black hair, and\r\ngrand bushy tails: black is their prevailing colour, but red, dun,\r\nparti-coloured, and white are common. In winter, the flocks graze\r\nbelow 8000 feet, on account of the great quantity of snow above that\r\nheight; in summer they find pasturage as high as 17,000 feet,\r\nconsisting of grass and small tufted _Carices,_ on which they browse\r\nwith avidity.\r\n\r\nThe zobo, or cross between the yak and hill cow (much resembling the\r\nEnglish cow), is but rarely seen in these mountains, though common in\r\nthe North West Himalaya. The yak is used as a beast of burden; and\r\nmuch of the wealth of the people consists in its rich milk and curd,\r\neaten either fresh or dried, or powdered into a kind of meal.\r\nThe hair is spun into ropes, and woven into a covering for their\r\ntents, which is quite pervious to wind and rain;* [The latter is,\r\nhowever, of little consequence in the dry climate of Tibet.] from the\r\nsame material are made the gauze shades for the eyes used in crossing\r\nsnowy passes. The bushy tail forms the well-known \"chowry\" or\r\nfly-flapper of the plains of India; the bones and dung serve for\r\nfuel. The female drops one calf in April; and the young yaks are very\r\nfull of gambols, tearing up and down the steep grassy and rocky\r\nslopes: their flesh is delicious, much richer and more juicy than\r\ncommon veal; that of the old yak is sliced and dried in the sun,\r\nforming jerked meat, which is eaten raw, the scanty proportion of fat\r\npreventing its becoming very rancid, so that I found it palatable\r\nfood: it is called _schat-tcheu_ (dried meat). I never observed the\r\nyak to be annoyed by any insects; indeed at the elevation it\r\ninhabits, there are no large diptera, bots, or gadflies to infest it.\r\nIt loves steep places, delighting to scramble among rocks, and to sun\r\nits black hide perched on the glacial boulders which strew the\r\nWallanchoon flat, and on which these beasts always sleep. Their\r\naverage value is from two to three pounds, but the price varies with\r\nthe season. In autumn, when her calf is killed for food, the mother\r\nwill yield no milk, unless the herdsman gives it the calf's foot to\r\nlick, or lays a stuffed skin before it, to fondle, which it does with\r\neagerness, expressing its satisfaction by short grunts, exactly like\r\nthose of a pig, a sound which replaces the low uttered by ordinary\r\ncattle. The yak, though indifferent to ice and snow and to changes of\r\ntemperature, cannot endure hunger so long as the sheep, nor pick its\r\nway so well upon stony ground. Neither can it bear damp heat, for\r\nwhich reason it will not live in summer below 7000 feet, where liver\r\ndisease carries it off after a very few years.* [Nevertheless, the\r\nyak seems to have survived the voyage to England. I find in Turner's\r\n\"Tibet\" (p. 189), that a bull sent by that traveller to Mr. Hastings,\r\nreached England alive, and after suffering from languor, so far\r\nrecovered its health and vigour as to become the father of many\r\ncalves. Turner does not state by what mother these calves were born,\r\nan important omission, as he adds that all these died but one cow,\r\nwhich bore a calf by an Indian bull. A painting of the yak (copied\r\ninto Turner's book) by Stubbs, the animal painter, may be seen in the\r\nMuseum of the Royal College of Surgeons, London. The artist is\r\nprobably a little indebted to description for the appearance of its\r\nhair in a native state, for it is represented much too even in\r\nlength, and reaching to too uniform a depth from the flanks.] Lastly,\r\nthe yak is ridden, especially by the fat Lamas, who find its shaggy\r\ncoat warm, and its paces easy; under these circumstances it is always\r\nled. The wild yak or bison (D'hong) of central Asia, the superb\r\nprogenitor of this animal, is the largest native animal of Tibet, in\r\nvarious parts of which country it is found; and the Tibetans say, in\r\nreference to its size, that the liver is a load for a tame yak.\r\nThe Sikkim Dewan gave Dr. Campbell and myself an animated account of\r\nthe chase of this animal, which is hunted by large dogs, and shot\r\nwith a blunderbuss: it is untameable and horridly fierce, falling\r\nupon you with horns and chest, and if he rasps you with his tongue,\r\nit is so rough as to scrape the flesh from the bones. The horn is\r\nused as a drinking-cup in marriage feasts, and on other grand\r\noccasions. My readers are probably familiar with Messrs. Huc and\r\nGabet's account of a herd of these animals being frozen fast in the\r\nhead-waters of the Yangtsekiang river. There is a noble specimen in\r\nthe British Museum not yet set up, and another is preparing for\r\nexhibition in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of these frontier districts belong to two very\r\ndifferent tribes, but all are alike called Bhoteeas (from Bhote, the\r\nproper name of Tibet), and have for many centuries been located in\r\nwhat is--in climate and natural features--a neutral ground between\r\ndry Tibet Proper, and the wet Himalayan gorges. They inhabit a\r\nclimate too cold for either the Lepcha or Nepalese, migrating between\r\n6000 and 15,000 feet with the seasons, always accompanied by their\r\nherds. In all respects of appearance, religion, manners, customs, and\r\nlanguage, they are Tibetans and Lama Booddhists, but they pay tax to\r\nthe Nepal and Sikkim Rajahs, to whom they render immense service by\r\nkeeping up and facilitating the trade in salt, wool, musk, etc.,\r\nwhich could hardly be conducted without their co-operation. They levy\r\na small tax on all imports, and trade a little on their own account,\r\nbut are generally poor and very indolent. In their alpine summer\r\nquarters they grow scanty crops of wheat, barley, turnips, and\r\nradishes; and at their winter quarters, as at Loongtoong, the better\r\nclasses cultivate fine crops of buck-wheat, millet, spinach, etc.;\r\nthough seldom enough for their support, as in spring they are obliged\r\nto buy rice from the inhabitants of the lower regions. Equally\r\ndependent on Nepal and Tibet, they very naturally hold themselves\r\nindependent of both; and I found that my roving commission from the\r\nNepal Rajah was not respected, and the guard of Ghorkas held very\r\ncheap.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Wallanchoon, I was conducted to two tents, each\r\nabout eight feet long, of yak's hair, striped blue and white, which\r\nhad been pitched close to the village for my accommodation. Though\r\nthe best that could be provided, and larger than my own, they were\r\nwretched in the extreme, being of so loose a texture that the wind\r\nblew through them: each was formed of two cloths with a long slit\r\nbetween them, that ran across the top, giving egress to the smoke,\r\nand ingress to the weather: they were supported on two short poles,\r\nkept to the ground by large stones, and fastened by yak's hair ropes.\r\nA fire was smoking vigorously in the centre of one, and some planks\r\nwere laid at the end for my bed. A crowd of people soon came to stare\r\nand loll out their tongues at me, my party, and travelling equipage;\r\nthough very civil, and only offensive in smell, they were\r\ntroublesome, from their eager curiosity to see and handle everything;\r\nso that I had to place a circle of stones round the tents, whilst a\r\nsoldier stood by, on the alert to keep them off. A more idle people\r\nare not to be found, except with regard to spinning, which is their\r\nconstant occupation, every man and woman carrying a bundle of wool in\r\nthe breast of their garments, which is spun by hand with a spindle,\r\nand wound off on two cross-pieces at its lower end. Spinning,\r\nsmoking, and tea-drinking are their chief pursuits; and the women\r\ntake all the active duties of the dairy and house. They live very\r\nhappily together, fighting being almost unknown.\r\n\r\nSoon after my arrival I was waited on by the Guobah (or head-man), a\r\ntall, good-looking person, dressed in a purple woollen robe, with\r\ngood pearl and coral ear and finger-rings, and a broad ivory ring\r\nover the left thumb,* [A broad ring of this material, agate, or\r\nchalcedony, is a mark of rank here, as amongst the Man-choos, and\r\nthroughout Central Asia.] as a guard when using the bow; he wore a\r\nneat thick white felt cap, with the border turned up, and a silk\r\ntassel on the top; this he removed with both hands and held before\r\nhim, bowing three times on entering. He was followed by a crowd, some\r\nof whom were his own people, and brought a present of a kid, fowls,\r\nrice, and eggs, and some spikenard roots (_Nardostachys Jatamansi,_ a\r\nspecies of valerian smelling strongly of patchouli), which is a very\r\nfavourite perfume. After paying some compliments, he showed me round\r\nthe village. During my walk, I found that I had a good many\r\nobjections to overrule before I could proceed to the Wallanchoon\r\npass, nearly two days' journey to the northward. In the first place,\r\nthe Guobah disputed the Nepal rajah's authority to pass me through\r\nhis dominions; and besides the natural jealousy of these people when\r\nintruded upon, they have very good reasons for concealing the amount\r\nof revenue they raise from their position, and for keeping up the\r\ndelusion that they alone can endure the excessive climate of these\r\nregions, or undergo the hardships and toil of the salt trade. My\r\npassport said nothing about the passes; my people, and especially the\r\nGhorkas, detested the keen, cold, and cutting wind; at Mywa Guola, I\r\nhad been persuaded by the Havildar to put off providing snow-boots\r\nand blankets, on the assurance that I should easily get them at\r\nWalloong, which I now found all but impossible, owing to there being\r\nno bazaar. My provisions were running short, and for the same reason\r\nI had no present hope of replenishing them. All my party had, I\r\nfound, reckoned with certainty that I should have had enough of this\r\nelevation and weather by the time I reached Walloong. Some of them\r\nfell sick; the Guobah swore that the passes were full of snow, and\r\nhad been impracticable since October; and the Ghorka Havildar\r\nrespectfully deposed that he had no orders relative to the pass.\r\nPrompt measures were requisite, so I told all my people that I should\r\nstop the next day at Walloong, and proceed on the following on a\r\nthree days' journey to the pass, with or without the Guobah's\r\npermission. To the Ghorka soldiers I said that the present they would\r\nreceive, and the character they would take to their commandant,\r\ndepended on their carrying out this point, which had been fully\r\nexplained before starting. My servants I told that their pay and\r\nreward also depended on their implicit obedience. I took the Guobah\r\naside and showed him troops of yaks (tethered by halters and toggles\r\nto a long rope stretched between two rocks), which had that morning\r\narrived laden with salt from the north; I told him it was vain to try\r\nand deceive me; that my passport was ample, and that I should expect\r\na guide, provisions, and snow-boots the next day; and that every\r\nimpediment and every facility should be reported to the rajah.\r\n\r\nDuring my two days' stay at Walloong, the weather was bitterly cold:\r\nas heretofore, the nights and mornings were cloudless, but by noon\r\nthe whole sky became murky, the highest temperature (50 degrees)\r\noccurring at 10 a.m. At this season the prospect from this elevation\r\n(10,385 feet), was dreary in the extreme; and the quantity of snow on\r\nthe mountains, which was continually increasing, held out a dismal\r\npromise for my chance of exploring lofty uninhabited regions.\r\nAll annual and deciduous vegetation had long past, and the lofty\r\nHimalayas are very poor in mosses and lichens, as compared with the\r\nEuropean Alps, and arctic regions in general. The temperature\r\nfluctuated from 22 degrees at sunrise, to 50 degrees at 10 a.m.; the\r\nmean being 35 degrees;* [This gives 1 degrees Fahr. for every 309\r\nfeet of elevation, using contemporaneous observations at Calcutta,\r\nand correcting for latitude, etc.] one night it fell to 64 degrees.\r\nThroughout the day, a south wind blew strong and cold up the valley,\r\nand at sunset was replaced by a keen north blast, searching every\r\ncorner, and piercing through tent and blankets. Though the sun's rays\r\nwere hot for an hour or two in the morning, its genial influence was\r\nnever felt in the wind. The air was never very dry, the wet-bulb\r\nthermometer standing during the day 3.75 degrees below the dry, thus\r\ngiving a mean dew-point of 30.25 degrees. A thermometer sunk two feet\r\nstood at 44 degrees, fully 9 degrees above the mean temperature of\r\nthe air; one exposed to the clear sky, stood, during the day, several\r\ndegrees below the air in shade, and, at night, from 9 degrees to\r\n14.75 degrees lower. The black-bulb thermometer, in the sun, rose to\r\n65.75 degrees above the air, indicating upwards of 90 degrees\r\ndifference at nearly the warmest part of the day, between contiguous\r\nshaded and sunny exposures. The sky, when cloudless, was generally a\r\ncold blue or steel-grey colour, but at night the stars were large,\r\nand twinkled gloriously. The black-glass photometer indicated 10.521\r\ninches* [On three mornings the maxima occurred at between 9 and 10\r\na.m. They were, Nov. 24th, 10.509, Nov. 25th, 10.521. On the 25th, at\r\nTuquoroma, I recorded 10.510. The maximum effect observed at\r\nDorjiling (7340 feet) was 10.328, and on the plains of India 10.350.\r\nThe maximum I ever recorded was in Yangma valley (15,186 feet),\r\n10.572 at 1 p.m.] as the maximum intensity of sunlight; the\r\ntemperature of the river close by fell to 32 degrees during the\r\nnight, and rose to 37 degrees in the day. In my tent, the temperature\r\nfluctuated with the state of the fire, from 26 degrees at night to 58\r\ndegrees when the sun beat on it; but the only choice was between cold\r\nand suffocating smoke.\r\n\r\nAfter a good many conferences with the Guobah, some bullying, douce\r\nviolence, persuasions, and the prescribing of pills, prayers, and\r\ncharms in the shape of warm water, for the sick of the village,\r\nwhereby I gained some favour, I was, on the 25th Nov., grudgingly\r\nprepared for the trip to Wallanchoon, with a guide, and some\r\nsnow-boots for those of my party whom I took with me.\r\n\r\nThe path lay north-west up the valley, which became thickly wooded\r\nwith silver-fir and juniper; we gradually ascended, crossing many\r\nstreams from lateral gulleys, and huge masses of boulders. Evergreen\r\nrhododendrons soon replaced the firs, growing in inconceivable\r\nprofusion, especially on the slopes facing the south: east, and with\r\nno other shrubs or tree-vegetation, but scattered bushes of rose,\r\n_Spiraea,_ dwarf juniper, stunted birch, willow, honey-suckle,\r\nberberry, and a mountain-ash (_Pyrus_). What surprised me more than\r\nthe prevalence of rhododendron bushes, was the number of species of\r\nthis genus, easily recognised by the shape of their capsules, the\r\nform and woolly covering of the leaves; none were in flower, but I\r\nreaped a rich harvest of seed. At 12,000 feet the valley was wild,\r\nopen, and broad, with sloping mountains clothed for 1000 feet with\r\ndark-green rhododendron bushes; the river ran rapidly, and was broken\r\ninto falls here and there. Huge angular and detached masses of rock\r\nwere scattered about, and to the right and left snowy peaks towered\r\nover the surrounding mountains, while amongst the latter narrow\r\ngulleys led up to blue patches of glacial ice, with trickling streams\r\nand shoots of stones. Dwarf rhododendrons with strongly-scented\r\nleaves (_R. anthopogon_ and _setosum_), and abundance of a little\r\n_Andromeda,_ exactly like ling, with woody stems and tufted branches,\r\ngave a heathery appearance to the hill-sides. The prevalence of\r\nlichens, common to this country and to Scotland (especially L.\r\ngeographicus_), which coloured the rocks, added an additional feature\r\nto the resemblance to Scotch Highland scenery. Along the narrow path\r\nI found the two commonest of all British weeds, a grass (_Poa\r\nannua_), and the shepherd's purse! They had evidently been imported\r\nby man and yaks, and as they do not occur in India, I could not but\r\nregard these little wanderers from the north with the deepest\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nSuch incidents as these give rise to trains of reflection in the mind\r\nof the naturalist traveller; and the farther he may be from home and\r\nfriends, the more wild and desolate the country he is exploring, the\r\ngreater the difficulties and dangers under which he encounters these\r\nsubjects of his earliest studies in science; so much keener is the\r\ndelight with which he recognises them, and the more lasting is the\r\nimpression which they leave. At this moment these common weeds more\r\nvividly recall to me that wild scene than does all my journal, and\r\nremind me how I went on my way, taxing my memory for all it ever knew\r\nof the geographical distribution of the shepherd's purse, and musing\r\non the probability of the plant having found its way thither over all\r\nCentral Asia, and the ages that may have been occupied in its march.\r\n\r\nOn reaching 13,000 feet, the ground was everywhere hard and frozen,\r\nand I experienced the first symptoms of lassitude, headache, and\r\ngiddiness; which however, were but slight, and only came on with\r\nsevere exertion.\r\n\r\nWe encountered a group of Tibetans, encamped to leeward of an immense\r\nboulder of gneiss, against which they had raised a shelter with their\r\nsalt-bags, removed from their herd of yaks, which were grazing close\r\nby. They looked miserably cold and haggard, and their little upturned\r\neyes, much inflamed and bloodshot, testified to the hardships they\r\nhad endured in their march from the salt regions: they were crouched\r\nround a small fire of juniper wood, smoking iron pipes with agate\r\nmouthpieces. A resting-house was in sight across the stream--a loose\r\nstone hut, to which we repaired. I wondered why these Tibetans had\r\nnot taken possession of it, not being aware of the value they attach\r\nto a rock, on account of the great warmth which it imbibes from the\r\nsun's rays during the day, and retains at night. This invaluable\r\nproperty of otherwise inhospitable gneiss and granite I had\r\nafterwards many opportunities of proving; and when driven for a\r\nnight's shelter to such as rude nature might afford on the bleak\r\nmountain, I have had my blankets laid beneath \"the shadow of a great\r\nrock in a weary land.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of Dhamersala is applied, in the mountains as in the plains\r\nof India, to a house provided for the accommodation of travellers,\r\nwhether it be one of the beautiful caravanserais built to gratify the\r\npiety, ostentation, or benevolence of a rajah, or such a miserable\r\nshieling of rough stone and plank as that of Tuquoroma, in which we\r\ntook up our quarters, at 13,000 feet elevation. A cheerful fire soon\r\nblazed on the earthen floor, filling the room with the pungent odour\r\nof juniper, which made our eyes smart and water. The Ghorkas withdrew\r\nto one corner, and my Lepchas to a second, while one end was screened\r\noff for my couch; unluckily, the wall faced the north-east, and in\r\nthat direction there was a gulley in the snowy mountains, down which\r\nthe wind swept with violence, penetrating to my bed. I had calculated\r\nupon a good night's rest here, which I much needed, having been\r\nworried and unwell at Wallanchoon, owing to the Guobah's obstinacy. I\r\nhad not then learnt how to treat such conduct, and just before\r\nretiring to rest had further been informed by the Havildar that the\r\nGuobah declared we should find no food on our return. To remain in\r\nthese mountains without a supply was impossible, and the delay, of\r\nsending to Mywa Guola would not have answered; so I long lay awake,\r\noccupied in arranging measures. The night was clear and very cold;\r\nthe thermometer falling to 19 degrees at 9 p.m., and to 12 degrees in\r\nthe night, and that by my bedside to 20 degrees.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning (Nov. 26th) I started with a small party to\r\nvisit the pass, continuing up the broad, grassy valley; much snow lay\r\non the ground at 13,500 feet, which had fallen the previous month;\r\nand several glaciers were seen in lateral ravines at about the same\r\nelevation. After a couple of miles, we left the broad valley, which\r\ncontinued north-west, and struck northward up a narrow, stony, and\r\nsteep gorge, crossing an immense ancient moraine at its mouth. This\r\npath, which we followed for seven or eight miles, led up to the pass,\r\nwinding considerably, and keeping along the south-east exposures,\r\nwhich, being the most sunny, are the freest from snow. The morning\r\nwas splendid, the atmosphere over the dry rocks and earth, at 14,000\r\nfeet, vibrating from the power of the sun's rays, whilst vast masses\r\nof blue glacier and fields of snow choked every galley, and were\r\nspread over all shady places. Although, owing to the steepness and\r\nnarrowness of the gorge, no view was obtained, the scenery was wild\r\nand very grand. Just below where perpetual snow descends to the path,\r\nan ugly carved head of a demon, with blood-stained cheeks and\r\ngoggle-eyes, was placed in a niche of rock, and protected by a glass.\r\n\r\nAt 15,000 feet, the snow closed in on the path from all sides,\r\nwhether perpetual, glacial, or only the October fall, I could not\r\ntell; the guide declared it to be perpetual henceforward, though now\r\ndeepened by the very heavy October fall; the path was cut some three\r\nfeet through it. Enormous boulders of gneiss cumbered the bottom of\r\nthe gorge, which gradually widened as we approached its summit; and\r\nrugged masses of black and red gneiss and mica schist pierced the\r\nsnow, and stood out in dismal relief. For four miles continuously we\r\nproceeded over snow; which was much honey-combed on the surface, and\r\ntreacherous from the icy streams it covered, into which we every now\r\nand then stumbled; there was scarcely a trace of vegetation, and the\r\ncold was excessive, except in the sun.\r\n\r\nTowards the summit of the pass the snow lay very deep, and we\r\nfollowed the course of a small stream which cut through it, the walls\r\nof snow being breast-high on each side; the path was still frequented\r\nby yaks, of which we overtook a small party going to Tibet, laden\r\nwith planks. All the party appeared alike overcome by lassitude,\r\nshortness and difficulty of breathing, a sense of weight on the\r\nstomach, giddiness and headache, with tightness across the temples.\r\n\r\nJust below the summit was a complete bay of snow, girdled with two\r\nsharp peaks of red baked schists and gneiss, strangely contorted, and\r\nthrown up at all angles with no prevalent dip or strike, and\r\npermeated with veins of granite. The top itself, or boundary between\r\nNepal and Tibet, is a low saddle between two rugged ridges of rock,\r\nwith a cairn built on it, adorned with bits of stick and rag covered\r\nwith Tibetan inscriptions. The view into Tibet was not at all\r\ndistant, and was entirely of snowy mountains, piled ridge over ridge;\r\nthree of these spurs must, it is said, be crossed before any descent\r\ncan be made to the Chomachoo river (as the Arun is called in Tibet),\r\non which is the frontier fort of the Tibetans, and which is reached\r\nin two or three days. There is no plain or level ground of any kind\r\nbefore reaching that river, of which the valley is said to be wide\r\nand flat.\r\n\r\nStarting at 10 a.m., we did not reach the top till 3.30 p.m.; we had\r\nhalted nowhere, but the last few miles had been most laborious, and\r\nthe three of us who gained the summit were utterly knocked up.\r\nFortunately I carried my own barometer; it indicated 16.206 inches,\r\ngiving by comparative observations with Calcutta 16,764 feet, and\r\nwith Dorjiling, 16,748 feet, as the height of the pass.\r\nThe thermometer stood at 18 degrees, and the sun being now hidden\r\nbehind rocks, the south-east wind was bitterly cold. Hitherto the sun\r\nhad appeared as a clearly defined sparkling globe, against a dark-\r\nblue sky; but the depth of the azure blue was not so striking as I\r\nhad been led to suppose, by the accounts of previous travellers, in\r\nvery lofty regions. The plants gathered near the top of the pass were\r\nspecies of _Compositae,_ grass, and _Arenaria_; the most curious was\r\n_Saussurea gossypina,_ which forms great clubs of the softest white\r\nwool, six inches to a foot high, its flowers and leaves seeming\r\nuniformly clothed with the warmest fur that nature can devise.\r\nGenerally speaking, the alpine plants of the Himalaya are quite\r\nunprovided with any special protection of this kind; it is the\r\nprevalence and conspicuous nature of the exceptions that mislead, and\r\ninduce the careless observer to generalise hastily from solitary\r\ninstances; for the prevailing alpine genera of the Himalaya,\r\n_Arenarias,_ primroses, saxifrages, fumitories, _Ranunculi,_\r\ngentians, grasses, sedges, etc., have almost uniformly naked foliage.\r\n\r\nWe descended to the foot of the pass in about two hours, darkness\r\novertaking us by the way; the twilight, however, being prolonged by\r\nthe glare of the snow. Fearing the distance to Tuquoroma might be too\r\ngreat to permit of our returning thither the same night; I had had a\r\nfew things brought hither during the day, and finding they had\r\narrived, we encamped under the shelter of some enormous boulders (at\r\n13,500 feet), part of an ancient moraine, which extended some\r\ndistance along the bed of the narrow valley. Except an excruciating\r\nheadache, I felt no ill effects from my ascent; and after a supper of\r\ntea and biscuit, I slept soundly.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the temperature was 28 degrees at 6.30 a.m.,\r\nand rose to 30 degrees when the sun appeared over the mountains at\r\n8.15, at which time the black bulb thermometer suddenly mounted to\r\n112 degrees, upwards of 80 degrees above the temperature of the air.\r\nThe sky was brilliantly clear, with a very dry, cold, north wind\r\nblowing down the snowy valley of the pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nReturn from Wallanchoon pass -- Procure a bazaar at village -- Dance\r\nof Lamas -- Blacking face, Tibetan custom of -- Temple and convent --\r\nLeave for Kanglachem pass -- Send part of party back to Dorjiling --\r\nYangma Guola -- Drunken Tibetans -- Guobah of Wallanchoon -- Camp at\r\nfoot of Great Moraine -- View from top -- Geological speculations --\r\nHeight of moraines -- Cross dry lake-bed -- Glaciers -- More moraines\r\n-- Terraces -- Yangma temples -- Jos, books and furniture -- Peak of\r\nNango -- Lake -- Arrive at village -- Cultivation -- Scenery --\r\nPotatos -- State of my provisions -- Pass through village -- Gigantic\r\nboulders Terraces -- Wild sheep -- Lake-beds -- Sun's power -- Piles\r\nof gravel and detritus -- Glaciers and moraines -- Pabuk, elevation\r\nof -- Moonlight scene -- Return to Yangma -- Temperature, etc. --\r\nGeological causes of phenomena in valley -- Scenery of valley\r\non descent.\r\n\r\nI returned to the village of Wallanchoon, after collecting all the\r\nplants I could around my camp; amongst them a common-looking dock\r\nabounded in the spots which the yaks had frequented.\r\n\r\nThe ground was covered, as with heather, with abundance of creeping\r\ndwarf juniper, _Andromeda,_ and dwarf rhododendron. On arriving at\r\nthe village, I refused to receive the Guobah, unless he opened a\r\nbazaar at daylight on the following morning, where my people might\r\npurchase food; and threatened to bring charges against him before his\r\nRajah. At the same time I arranged for sending the main body of my\r\nparty down the Tambur, and so back to Sikkim, whilst I should, with\r\nas few as possible, visit the Kanglachem (Tibetan) pass in the\r\nadjacent valley to the eastward, and then, crossing the Nango,\r\nKambachen and Kanglanamo passes, reach Jongri in Sikkim, on the south\r\nflank of Kinchinjunga.\r\n\r\nStrolling out in the afternoon I saw a dance of Lamas; they were\r\ndisfigured with black paint* [I shall elsewhere have to refer to the\r\nTibetan custom of daubing the face with black pigment to protect the\r\nskin from the excessive cold and dryness of these lofty regions; and\r\nto the ludicrous imposition that was passed on the credulity of MM.\r\nHuc and Gabet.] and covered with rags, feathers, and scarlet cloth,\r\nand they carried long poles with bells and banners attached; thus\r\nequipped, they marched through the village, every now and then\r\nhalting, when they danced and gesticulated to the rude music of\r\ncymbals and horns, the bystanders applauding with shouts, crackers,\r\nand alms.\r\n\r\nI walked up to the convents, which were long ugly buildings, several\r\nstories high, built of wood, and daubed with red and grey paint.\r\nThe priests were nowhere to be found, and an old withered nun, whom\r\nI disturbed husking millet in a large wooden mortar, fled at my\r\napproach. The temple stood close by the convent, and had a broad low\r\narchitrave: the walls sloped inwards, as did the lintels: the doors\r\nwere black, and almost covered with a gigantic and disproportioned\r\npainting of a head, with bloody cheeks and huge teeth; it was\r\nsurrounded by myriads of goggle eyes, which seemed to follow one\r\nabout everywhere; and though in every respect rude, the effect was\r\nsomewhat imposing. The similarly proportioned gloomy portals of\r\nEgyptian fanes naturally invite comparison; but the Tibetan temples\r\nlack the sublimity of these; and the uncomfortable creeping sensation\r\nproduced by the many sleepless eyes of Boodh's numerous incarnations\r\nis very different from the awe with which we contemplate the\r\noutspread wings of the Egyptian symbol, and feel as in the presence\r\nof the God who says, \"I am Osiris the Great: no man hath dared to\r\nlift my veil.\"\r\n\r\nI had ascended behind the village, but returned down the \"via sacra,\"\r\na steep paved path flanked by mendongs or low stone dykes, into which\r\nwere let rows of stone slabs, inscribed with the sacred \"Om Mani\r\nPadmi om.\"--\"Hail to him of the lotus and jewel\"; an invocation of\r\nSakkya, who is usually represented holding a lotus flower with a\r\njewel in it.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, a scanty supply of vcry dirty rice was\r\nproduced, at a very high price. I had, however, so divided my party\r\nas not to require a great amount of food, intending to send most of\r\nthe people back by the Tambur to Dorjiling. I kept nineteen persons\r\nin all, selecting the most willing, as it was evident the journey at\r\nthis season would be one of great hardship: we took seven days' food,\r\nwhich was as much as they could carry. At noon, I left Wallanchoon,\r\nand mustered my party at the junction of the Tambur and Yangma,\r\nwhence I dismissed the party for Dorjiling, with my collections of\r\nplants, minerals, etc., and proceeded with the chosen ones to ascend\r\nthe Yangma river. The scenery was wild and very grand, our path lying\r\nthrough a narrow gorge, choked with pine trees, down which the river\r\nroared in a furious torrent; while the mountains on each side were\r\ncrested with castellated masses of rock, and sprinkled with snow.\r\nThe road was very bad, often up ladders, and along planks lashed to\r\nthe faces of precipices, and over-hanging the torrent, which it\r\ncrossed several times by plank bridges. By dark we arrived at Yangma\r\nGuola, a collection of empty wood huts buried in the rocky\r\nforest-clad valley, and took possession of a couple. They were well\r\nbuilt, raised on posts, with a stage and ladder at the gable end, and\r\nconsisted of one good-sized apartment. Around was abundance of dock,\r\ntogether with three common English plants.* [_Cardamine hirsuta,\r\nLimosella aquatica,_ and _Juncus bufonius._]\r\n\r\nThe night was calm, misty, and warm (Max. 41.5 degrees, Min. 29\r\ndegrees) for the elevation (9,300 feet). During the night, I was\r\nstartled out of my sleep by a blaze of light, and jumping up, found\r\nmyself in presence of a party of most sinister-looking, black, ragged\r\nTibetans, armed with huge torches of pine, that filled the room with\r\nflame and pitchy smoke. I remembered their arriving just before dark,\r\nand their weapons dispelled my fears, for they came armed with bamboo\r\njugs of Murwa beer, and were very drunk and very amiable: they\r\ngrinned, nodded, kotowed, lolled out their tongues, and scratched\r\ntheir ears in the most seductive manner, then held out their jugs,\r\nand besought me by words and gestures to drink and be happy too.\r\nI awoke my servant (always a work of difficulty), and with some\r\ntrouble ejected the visitors, happily without setting the house on\r\nfire. I heard them toppling head over heels down the stair, which I\r\nafterwards had drawn up to prevent further intrusion, and in spite of\r\ntheir drunken orgies, was soon lulled to sleep again by the music of\r\nthe roaring river.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th November, I continued my course north up the Yangma\r\nvalley, which after five miles opened considerably, the trees\r\ndisappearing, and the river flowing more tranquilly, and through a\r\nbroader valley, when above 11,000 feet elevation. The Guobah of\r\nWallanchoon overtook us on the road; on his way, he said, to collect\r\nthe revenues at Yangma village, but in reality to see what I was\r\nabout. He owns five considerable villages, and is said to pay a tax\r\nof 6000 rupees (600 pounds) to the Rajah of Nepal: this is no doubt a\r\ngreat exaggeration, but the revenues of such a position, near a pass\r\nfrequented almost throughout the year, must be considerable.\r\nEvery yak going and coming is said to pay 1s., and every horse 4s.;\r\ncattle, sheep, ponies, land, and wool are all taxed; he exports also\r\nquantities of timber to Tibet, and various articles from the plains\r\nof India. He joined my party and halted where I did, had his little\r\nChinese rug spread, and squatted cross-legged on it, whilst his\r\nservant prepared his brick tea with salt, butter, and soda, of which\r\nhe partook, snuffed, smoked, rose up, had all his traps repacked, and\r\nwas off again.\r\n\r\nWe encamped at a most remarkable place: the valley was broad, with\r\nlittle vegetation but stunted tree-junipers: rocky snow-topped\r\nmountains rose on either side, bleak, bare, and rugged; and in front,\r\nclose above my tent, was a gigantic wall of rocks, piled--as if by\r\nthe Titans--completely across the valley, for about three-quarters of\r\na mile. This striking phenomenon had excited all my curiosity on\r\nfirst obtaining a view of it. The path, I found, led over it, close\r\nunder its west end, and wound amongst the enormous detached fragments\r\nof which it was formed, and which were often eighty feet square: all\r\nwere of gneiss and schist, with abundance of granite in blocks and\r\nveins. A superb view opened from the top, revealing its nature to be\r\na vast moraine, far below the influence of any existing glaciers, but\r\nwhich at some antecedent period had been thrown across by a glacier\r\ndescending to 10,000 feet, from a lateral valley on the east flank.\r\nStanding on the top, and looking south, was the Yangma valley (up\r\nwhich I had come), gradually contracting to a defile, girdled by\r\nsnow-tipped mountains, whose rocky flanks mingled with the black pine\r\nforest below. Eastward the moraine stretched south of the lateral\r\nvalley, above which towered the snowy peak of Nango, tinged rosy red,\r\nand sparkling in the rays of the setting sun: blue glaciers peeped\r\nfrom every gulley on its side, but these were 2000 to 3000 feet above\r\nthis moraine; they were small too, and their moraines were mere\r\ngravel, compared with this. Many smaller consecutive moraines, also,\r\nwere evident along the bottom of that lateral valley, from this great\r\none up to the existing glaciers. Looking up the Yangma was a flat\r\ngrassy plain, hemmed in by mountains, and covered with other\r\nstupendous moraines, which rose ridge behind ridge, and cut off the\r\nview of all but the mountain tops to the north. The river meandered\r\nthrough the grassy plain (which appeared a mile and a half broad at\r\nthe utmost, and perhaps as long), and cut through the great moraine\r\non its eastern side, just below the junction of the stream from the\r\nglacial valley, which, at the lower part of its course, flowed over\r\na broad steep shingle bed.\r\n\r\nIllustration--ANCIENT MORAINE THROWN ACROSS THE YANGMA VALLEY, EAST\r\nNEPAL (Elevn. 11,000 ft.)\r\n\r\nI descended to my camp, full of anxious anticipations for the morrow;\r\nwhile the novelty of the scene, and its striking character, the\r\ncomplexity of the phenomena, the lake-bed, the stupendous\r\nice-deposited moraine, and its remoteness from any existing ice, the\r\nbroad valley and open character of the country, were all marked out\r\nas so many problems suddenly conjured up for my unaided solution, and\r\nkept me awake for many hours. I had never seen a glacier or moraine\r\non land before, but being familiar with sea ice and berg transport,\r\nfrom voyaging in the South Polar regions, I was strongly inclined to\r\nattribute the formation of this moraine to a period when a glacial\r\nocean stood high on the Himalaya, made fiords of the valleys, and\r\nfloated bergs laden with blocks from the lateral gulleys, which the\r\nwinds and currents would deposit along certain lines. On the\r\nfollowing morning I carried a barometer to the top of the moraine,\r\nwhich proved to be upwards of 700 feet above the floor of the valley,\r\nand 400 above the dry lake-bed which it bounded, and to which we\r\ndescended on our route up the valley. The latter was grassy and\r\npebbly, perfectly level, and quite barren, except a very few pines at\r\nthe bases of the encircling mountains, and abundance of\r\nrhododendrons, _Andromeda_ and juniper on the moraines. Isolated\r\nmoraines occurred along both flanks of the valley, some higher than\r\nthat I have described, and a very long one was thrown nearly across\r\nfrom the upper end of another lateral gulley on the east side, also\r\nleading up to the glaciers of Nango. This second moraine commenced a\r\nmile and a half above the first, and abutting on the east flank of\r\nthe valley, stretched nearly across, and then curving round, ran down\r\nit, parallel to and near the west flank, from which it was separated\r\nby the Yangma river: it was abruptly terminated by a conical hill of\r\nboulders, round whose base the river flowed, entering the dry\r\nlake-bed from the west, and crossing it in a south-easterly direction\r\nto the western extremity of the great moraine.\r\n\r\nThe road, on its ascent to the second moraine, passed over an immense\r\naccumulation of glacial detritus at the mouth of the second lateral\r\nvalley, entirely formed of angular fragments of gneiss and granite,\r\nloosely bound together by felspathic sand. The whole was disposed in\r\nconcentric ridges radiating from the mouth of the valley, and\r\ndescending to the flat; these were moraines _in petto,_ formed by the\r\naction of winter snow and ice upon the loose debris. A stream flowed\r\nover this debris, dividing into branches before reaching the\r\nlake-bed, where its waters were collected, and whence it meandered\r\nsouthward to fall into the Yangma.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the second moraine, a very curious scene opened up\r\nthe valley, of another but more stony and desolate level lake-bed,\r\nthrough which the Yangma (here very rapid) rushed, cutting a channel\r\nabout sixty feet deep; the flanks of this second lake-bed were cut\r\nmost distinctly into two principal terraces, which were again\r\nsubdivided into others, so that the general appearance was that of\r\nmany raised beaches, but each so broken up, that, with the exception\r\nof one on the banks of the river, none were continuous for any\r\ndistance. We descended 200 feet, and crossed the valley and river\r\nobliquely in a north-west direction, to a small temple and convent\r\nwhich stood on a broad flat terrace under the black, precipitous,\r\nwest flank: this gave me a good opportunity of examining the\r\nstructure of this part of the valley, which was filled with an\r\naccumulation, probably 200 feet thick at the deepest part, of angular\r\ngravel and enormous boulders, both imbedded in the gravel, and\r\nstrewed on the flat surfaces of the terraces. The latter were always\r\nbroadest opposite to the lateral valleys, perfectly horizontal for\r\nthe short distance that they were continuous; and very barren; there\r\nwere no traces of fossils, nor could I assure myself of\r\nstratification. The accumulation was wholly glacial; and probably a\r\nlake had supervened on the melting of the great glacier and its\r\nrecedence, which lake, confined by a frozen moraine, would\r\nperiodically lose its waters by sudden accessions of heat melting the\r\nice of the latter. Stratified silt, no doubt, once covered the lake\r\nbottom, and the terraces have, in succession, been denuded of it by\r\nrain and snow. These causes are now in operation amongst the\r\nstupendous glaciers of north-east Sikkim, where valleys, dammed up by\r\nmoraines, exhibit lakes hemmed in between these, the base of the\r\nglacier, and the flanks of the valleys.\r\n\r\nIllustration--ANCIENT MORAINES IN THE YANGMA VALLEY.\r\n\r\nYangma convents stood at the mouth of a gorge which opened upon the\r\nuppermost terrace; and the surface of the latter, here well covered\r\nwith grass, was furrowed into concentric radiating ridges, which were\r\nvery conspicuous from a distance. The buildings consisted of a\r\nwretched collection of stone huts, painted red, enclosed by loose\r\nstone dykes. Two shockingly dirty Lamas received me and conducted me\r\nto the temple, which had very thick walls, but was undistinguishable\r\nfrom the other buildings. A small door opened upon an apartment piled\r\nfull of old battered gongs, drums, scraps of silk hangings, red\r\ncloth, broken praying-machines--relics much resembling those in the\r\nlumber-room of a theatre. A ladder led from this dismal hole to the\r\nupper story, which was entered by a handsomely carved and gilded\r\ndoor: within, all was dark, except from a little lattice-window\r\ncovered with oil-paper. On one side was the library, a carved case,\r\nwith a hundred gilded pigeon-holes, each holding a real or sham book,\r\nand each closed by a little square door, on which hung a bag full  of\r\namulets. In the centre of the book-case was a recess, containing a\r\ngenuine Jos or Fo, graced with his Chinese attribute of very long\r\npendulous moustaches and beard, and totally wanting that air of\r\ncontemplative repose which the Tibetan Lamas give to their idols.\r\nBanners were suspended around, with paintings of Lhassa, Teshoo\r\nLoombo, and various incarnations of Boodh. The books were of the\r\nusual Tibetan form, oblong squares of separate block-printed leaves\r\nof paper, made in Nepal or Bhotan from the bark of a _Daphne,_ bound\r\ntogether by silk cords, and placed between ornamented wooden boards.\r\nOn our way up the valley, we had passed some mendongs and chaits, the\r\nlatter very pretty stone structures, consisting of a cube, pyramid,\r\nhemisphere, and cone placed on the top of one another, forming\r\ntogether the tasteful combination which appears on the cover of\r\nthese volumes.\r\n\r\nBeyond the convents the valley again contracted, and on crossing a\r\nthird, but much lower, moraine, a lake opened to view, surrounded by\r\nflat terraces, and a broad gravelly shore, part of the lake being\r\ndry. To the west, the cliffs were high, black and steep: to the east\r\na large lateral valley, filled at about 1500 feet up with blue\r\nglaciers, led (as did the other lateral valleys) to the gleaming\r\nsnows of Nango; the moraine, too, here abutted on the east flank of\r\nthe Yangma valley, below the mouth of the lateral one. Much snow\r\n(from the October fall) lay on the ground, and the cold was pinching\r\nin the shade; still I could not help attempting to sketch this\r\nwonderfully grand scene, especially as lakes in the Himalaya are\r\nextremely rare: the present one was about a mile long, very shallow,\r\nbut broad, and as smooth as glass: it reminded me of the tarn in\r\nGlencoe. The reflected lofty peak of Nango appeared as if frozen deep\r\ndown in its glassy bed, every snowy crest and ridge being rendered\r\nwith perfect precision.\r\n\r\nIllustration--LOOKING ACROSS YANGMA VALLEY.\r\n\r\n Nango is about 18,000 feet high; it is the next lofty mountain of\r\nthe Kinchinjunga group to the west of Junnoo, and I doubt if any\r\nequally high peak occurs again for some distance further west in\r\nNepal. Facing the Yangma valley, it presents a beautiful range of\r\nprecipices of black rock, capped with a thick crust of snow: below\r\nthe cliffs the snow again appears continuously and very steep, for\r\n2000 to 3000 feet downwards, where it terminates in glaciers that\r\ndescend to 14,000 feet. The steepest snow-beds appear cut into\r\nvertical ridges, whence the whole snowy face is--as it were--crimped\r\nin perpendicular, closely-set, zigzag lines, doubtless caused by the\r\nmelting process, which furrows the surface of the snow into channels\r\nby which the water is carried off: the effect is very beautiful, but\r\nimpossible to represent on paper, from the extreme delicacy of the\r\nshadows, and at the same time the perfect definition and precision of\r\nthe outlines.\r\n\r\nTowards the head of the lake, its bed was quite dry and gravelly, and\r\nthe river formed a broad delta over it: the terraces here were\r\nperhaps 100 feet above its level, those at the lower end not nearly\r\nso much. Beyond the lake, the river became again a violent torrent,\r\nrushing in a deep chasm, till we arrived at the fork of the valley,\r\nwhere we once more met with numerous dry lake-beds, with terraces\r\nhigh up on the mountain sides.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we reached the village of Yangma, a miserable\r\ncollection of 200 to 300 stone huts, nestling under the steep\r\nsouth-east flank of a lofty, flat-topped terrace, laden with gigantic\r\nglacial boulders, and projecting southward from a snowy mountain\r\nwhich divides the valley. We encamped on the flat under the village,\r\namongst some stone dykes, enclosing cultivated fields. One arm of the\r\nvalley runs hence N.N.E. amongst snowy mountains, and appeared quite\r\nfull of moraines; the other, or continuation of the Yangma, runs\r\nW.N.W., and leads to the Kanglachem pass.\r\n\r\nNear our camp (of which the elevation was 13,500 feet), radishes,\r\nbarley, wheat, potatos, and turnips, were cultivated as summer crops,\r\nand we even saw some on the top of the terrace, 400 feet above our\r\ncamp, or nearly 14,000 feet above the sea; these were grown in small\r\nfields cleared of stones, and protected by dykes.\r\n\r\nThe scenery, though dismal, (no juniper even attaining this\r\nelevation,) was full of interest and grandeur, from the number and\r\nvariety of snowy peaks and glaciers all around the elevated horizon;\r\nthe ancient lake-beds, now green or brown with scanty vegetation, the\r\nvast moraines, the ridges of glacial debris, the flat terraces,\r\nmarking, as it were with parallel roads, the bluff sides of the\r\nmountains, the enormous boulders perched upon them, and strewed\r\neverywhere around, the little Boodhist monuments of quaint,\r\npicturesque shapes, decorated with poles and banners, the\r\nmany-coloured dresses of the people, the brilliant blue of the\r\ncloudless heaven by day, the depth of its blackness by night,\r\nheightened by the light of the stars, that blaze and twinkle with a\r\nlustre unknown in less lofty regions: all these were subjects for\r\ncontemplation, rendered more impressive by the stillness of the\r\natmosphere, and the silence that reigned around. The village seemed\r\nburied in repose throughout the day: the inhabitants had already\r\nhybernated, their crops were stored, the curd made and dried, the\r\npasses closed, the soil frozen, the winter's stock of fuel housed,\r\nand the people had retired into the caverns of their half\r\nsubterranean houses, to sleep, spin wool, and think of Boodh, if of\r\nanything at all, the dead, long winter through. The yaks alone can\r\nfind anything to do: so long as any vegetation remains they roam and\r\neat it, still yielding milk, which the women take morning and\r\nevening, when their shrill whistle and cries are heard for a few\r\nminutes, as they call the grunting animals. No other sounds, save the\r\nharsh roar and hollow echo of the falling rock, glacier, or snow-bed,\r\ndisturbed the perfect silence of the day or night.* [Snow covers the\r\nground at Yangma from December till April, and the falls are said to\r\nbe very heavy, at times amounting to 12 feet in depth.]\r\n\r\nI had taken three days' food to Yangma, and stayed there as long as\r\nit lasted: the rest of my provisions I had left below the first\r\nmoraine, where a lateral valley leads east over the Nango pass to the\r\nKambachen valley, which lay on the route back to Sikkim.\r\n\r\nI was premature in complaining of my Wallanchoon tents, those\r\nprovided for me at Yangma being infinitely worse, mere rags, around\r\nwhich I piled sods as a defence from the insidious piercing\r\nnight-wind that descended from the northern glaciers in calm, but\r\nmost keen, breezes. There was no food to be procured in the village,\r\nexcept a little watery milk, and a few small watery potatos.\r\nThe latter have only very recently been introduced amongst the\r\nTibetans, from the English garden at the Nepalese capital, I believe,\r\nand their culture has not spread in these regions further east than\r\nKinchinjunga, but they will very soon penetrate into Tibet from\r\nDorjiling, or eastward from Nepal. My private stock of provisions\r\n--consisting chiefly of preserved meats from my kind friend\r\nMr. Hodgson--had fallen very low; and I here found to my dismay that\r\nof four remaining two-pound cases, provided as meat, three contained\r\nprunes, and one _\"dindon aux truffes!\"_ Never did luxuries come more\r\ninopportunely; however the greasy French viand served for many a\r\nfuture meal as sauce to help me to bolt my rice, and according to the\r\ntheory of chemists, to supply animal heat in these frigid regions.\r\nAs for my people, they were not accustomed to much animal food; two\r\npounds of rice, with ghee and chilis, forming their common diet under\r\ncold and fatigue. The poorer Tibetans, especially, who undergo great\r\nprivation and toil, live almost wholly on barley-meal, with tea, and\r\na very little butter and salt: this is not only the case with those\r\namongst whom I mixed so much, but is also mentioned by MM. Huc and\r\nGabet, as having been observed by them in other parts of Tibet.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of December I visited the village and terrace, and\r\nproceeded to the head of the Yangma valley, in order to ascend the\r\nKanglachem pass as far as practicable. The houses are low, built of\r\nstone, of no particular shape, and are clustered in groups against\r\nthe steep face of the terrace; filthy lanes wind amongst them, so\r\nnarrow, that if you are not too tall, you look into the slits of\r\nwindows on either hand, by turning your head, and feel the noisome\r\nwarm air in whiffs against your face. Glacial boulders lie scattered\r\nthroughout the village, around and beneath the clusters of houses,\r\nfrom which it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the native rock.\r\nI entered one house by a narrow low door through walls four feet\r\nthick, and found myself in an apartment full of wool, juniper-wood,\r\nand dried dung for fuel: no one lived in the lower story, which was\r\nquite dark, and as I stood in it my head was in the upper, to which I\r\nascended by a notched pole (like that in the picture of a Kamschatk\r\nhouse in Cook's voyage), and went into a small low room. The inmates\r\nlooked half asleep, they were intolerably indolent and filthy, and\r\nwere employed in spinning wool and smoking. A hole in the wall of the\r\nupper apartment led me on to the stone roof of the neighbouring\r\nhouse, from which I passed to the top of a glacial boulder,\r\ndescending thence by rude steps to the narrow alley. Wishing to see\r\nas much as I could, I was led on a winding course through, in and\r\nout, and over the tops of the houses of the village, which\r\nalternately reminded me of a stone quarry or gravel pit, and gipsies\r\nliving in old lime-kilns; and of all sorts of odd places that are\r\nturned to account as human habitations.\r\n\r\nFrom the village I ascended to the top of the terrace, which is a\r\nperfectly level, sandy, triangular plain, pointing down the valley at\r\nthe fork of the latter, and abutting against the flank of a steep,\r\nrocky, snow-topped mountain to the northward. Its length is probably\r\nhalf a mile from north to south, but it runs for two miles westward up\r\nthe valley, gradually contracting. The surface, though level, is very\r\nuneven, being worn into hollows, and presenting ridges and hillocks of\r\nblown sand and gravel, with small black tufts of rhododendron.\r\nEnormous boulders of gneiss and granite were scattered over the\r\nsurface; one of the ordinary size, which I measured, was seventy feet\r\nin girth, and fifteen feet above the ground, into which it had partly\r\nsunk. From the southern pointed end I took sketches of the opposite\r\nflanks of the valleys east and west. The river was about 400 feet\r\nbelow me, and flowed in a little flat lake-bed; other terraces skirted\r\nit, cut out, as it were, from the side of that I was on. On the\r\nopposite flank of the valley were several superimposed terraces, of\r\nwhich the highest appeared to tally with the level I occupied, and the\r\nlowest was raised very little above the river; none were continuous\r\nfor any distance, but the upper one in particular, could be most\r\nconspicuously traced up and down the main valley, whilst, on looking\r\nacross to the eastern valley, a much higher, but less distinctly\r\nmarked one appeared on it. The road to the pass lay west-north-west up\r\nthe north bank of the Yangma river, on the great terrace; for two\r\nmiles it was nearly level along the gradually narrowing shelf, at\r\ntimes dipping into the steep gulleys formed by lateral torrents from\r\nthe mountains; and as the terrace disappeared, or melted, as it were,\r\ninto the rising floor of the valley, the path descended upon the lower\r\nand smaller shelf.\r\n\r\nIllustration--DIAGRAM OF THE GLACIAL TERRACES AT THE FORK OF THE\r\nYANGA VALLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe came suddenly upon a flock of gigantic wild sheep, feeding on\r\nscanty tufts of dried sedge and grass; there were twenty-five of\r\nthese enormous animals, of whose dimensions the term sheep gives no\r\nidea: they are very long-legged, stand as high as a calf, and have\r\nimmense horns, so large that the fox is said to take up his abode in\r\ntheir hollows, when detached and bleaching, on the barren mountains\r\nof Tibet. Though very wild, I am sure I could easily have killed a\r\ncouple had I had my gun, but I had found it necessary to reduce my\r\nparty so uncompromisingly, that I could not afford a man both for my\r\ngun and instruments, and had sent the former back to Dorjiling, with\r\nMr. Hodgson's bird-stuffers, who had broken one of theirs. Travelling\r\nwithout fire-arms sounds strange in India, but in these regions\r\nanimal life is very rare, game is only procured with much hunting and\r\ntrouble, and to come within shot of a flock of wild sheep was a\r\ncontingency I never contemplated. Considering how very short we were\r\nof any food, and quite out of animal diet, I could not but bitterly\r\nregret the want of a gun, but consoled myself by reflecting that the\r\ninstruments were still more urgently required to enable me to survey\r\nthis extremely interesting valley. As it was, the great beasts\r\ntrotted off, and turned to tantalise me by grazing within an easy\r\nstalking distance. We saw several other flocks, of thirty to forty,\r\nduring the day, but never, either on this or any future occasion,\r\nwithin shot. The _Ovis Ammon_ of Pallas stands from four to five feet\r\nhigh, and measures seven feet from nose to tail; it is quite a\r\nTibetan animal, and is seldom seen below 14,000 feet, except when\r\ndriven lower by snow; and I have seen it as high as 18,000 feet.\r\nThe same animal, I believe, is found in Siberia, and is allied to the\r\nBig-horn of North America.\r\n\r\nSoon after descending to the bed of the valley, which is broad and\r\nopen, we came on a second dry lake-bed, a mile long, with shelving\r\nbanks all round, heavily snowed on the shaded side; the river was\r\ndivided into many arms, and meandered over it, and a fine\r\nglacier-bound valley opened into it from the south. There were no\r\nboulders on its surface, which was pebbly, with tufts of grass and\r\ncreeping tamarisk. On the banks I observed much granite, with large\r\nmica crystals, hornstone, tourmaline, and stratified quartz, with\r\ngranite veins parallel to the foliation or lamination.\r\n\r\nA rather steep ascent of a mile, through a contracted part of the\r\nvalley, led to another and smaller lake-bed, a quarter of a mile long\r\nand 100 yards broad, covered with patches of snow, and having no\r\nlateral valley opening into it: it faced the now stupendous masses of\r\nsnow and ice which filled the upper part of the Yangma valley.\r\nThis lake-bed (elevation, 15,186 feet) was strewed with enormous\r\nboulders; a rude stone hut stood near it, where we halted for a few\r\nminutes at 1 p.m., when the temperature was 42.2 degrees, while the\r\ndew-point was only 20.7 degrees.* [This indicates a very dry state of\r\nthe air, the saturation-point being 0.133 degrees; whereas, at the\r\nsame hour at Calcutta it was 0.559 degrees.] At the same time, the\r\nblack bulb thermometer, fully exposed on the snow, rose 54 degrees\r\nabove the air, and the photometer gave 10.572. Though the sun's power\r\nwas so great, there was, however, no appearance of the snow melting,\r\nevaporation proceeding with too great rapidity.\r\n\r\nIllustration--KANGLACHEM PASS.\r\n\r\nEnormous piles of gravel and sand had descended upon the upper end of\r\nthis lake-bed, forming shelves, terraces, and curving ridges,\r\napparently consolidated by ice, and covered in many places with snow.\r\nFollowing the stream, we soon came to an immense moraine, which\r\nblocked up the valley, formed of angular boulders, some of which were\r\nfifty feet high. Respiration had been difficult for some time, and\r\nthe guide we had taken from the village said we were some hours from\r\nthe top of the pass, and could get but a little way further; we\r\nhowever proceeded, plunging through the snow, till on cresting the\r\nmoraine a stupendous scene presented itself. A gulf of moraines, and\r\nenormous ridges of debris, lay at our feet, girdled by an\r\namphitheatre of towering, snow-clad peaks, rising to 17,000 and\r\n18,000 feet all around. Black scarped precipices rose on every side;\r\ndeep snow-beds and blue glaciers rolled down every gulley, converging\r\nin the hollow below, and from each transporting its own materials,\r\nthere ensued a complication of moraines, that presented no order to\r\nthe eye. In spite of their mutual interference, however, each had\r\nraised a ridge of debris or moraine parallel to itself.\r\n\r\nWe descended with great difficulty through the soft snow that covered\r\nthe moraine, to the bed of this gulf of snow and glaciers; and halted\r\nby an enormous stone, above the bed of a little lake, which was\r\nsnowed all over, but surrounded by two superimposed level terraces,\r\nwith sharply defined edges. The moraine formed a barrier to its now\r\nfrozen waters, and it appeared to receive the drainage of many\r\nglaciers, which filtered through their gravelly ridges and moraines.\r\n\r\nWe could make no further progress; the pass lay at the distance of\r\nseveral hours' march, up a valley to the north, down which the\r\nglacier must have rolled that had deposited this great moraine; the\r\npass had been closed since October, it being very lofty, and the head\r\nof this valley was far more snowy than that at Wallanchoon. We halted\r\nin the snow from 3 to 4 p.m., during which time I again took angles\r\nand observations; the height of this spot, called Pabuk, is 16,038\r\nfeet, whence the pass is probably considerably over 17,000 feet, for\r\nthere was a steep ascent beyond our position. The sun sank at 3 p.m.,\r\nand the thermometer immediately fell from 35 degrees to 30.75\r\ndegrees.* [At 4 o'clock, to 29.5 degrees, the average dew-point was\r\n16.3 degrees, and dryness 0.55; weight of vapour in a cubic foot,\r\n1.33 grains.]\r\n\r\nAfter fixing in my note and sketch books the principal features of\r\nthis sublime scene, we returned down the valley: the distance to our\r\ncamp being fully eight miles, night overtook us before we got\r\nhalf-way, but a two days' old moon guided us perfectly, a remarkable\r\ninstance of the clearness of the atmosphere at these great\r\nelevations. Lassitude, giddiness, and headache came on as our\r\nexertions increased, and took away the pleasure I should otherwise\r\nhave felt in contemplating by moonlight the varied phenomena, which\r\nseemed to crowd upon the restless imagination, in the different forms\r\nof mountain, glacier, moraine, lake, boulder and terrace. Happily I\r\nhad noted everything on my way up, and left nothing intentionally to\r\nbe done on returning. In making such excursions as this, it is above\r\nall things desirable to seize and book every object worth noticing on\r\nthe way out: I always carried my note-book and pencil tied to my\r\njacket pocket, and generally walked with them in my hand. It is\r\nimpossible to begin observing too soon, or to observe too much: if\r\nthe excursion is long, little is ever done on the way home; the\r\nbodily powers being mechanically exerted, the mind seeks repose, and\r\nbeing fevered through over-exertion, it can endure no train of\r\nthought, or be brought to bear on a subject.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Yangma, the thermometer never rose to 50 degrees,\r\nit fell to 14.75 degrees at night; the ground was frozen for several\r\ninches below the surface, but at two feet depth its temperature was\r\n37.5 degrees. The black bulb thermometer rose on one occasion 84\r\ndegrees above the surrounding air. Before leaving, I measured by\r\nangles and a base-line the elevations of the great village-terrace\r\nabove the river, and that of a loftier one, on the west flank of the\r\nmain valley; the former was about 400 and the latter 700 feet.\r\n\r\nConsidering this latter as the upper terrace, and concluding that it\r\nmarks a water level, it is not very difficult to account for its\r\norigin. There is every reason to suppose that the flanks of the\r\nvalley were once covered to the elevation of the upper terrace, with\r\nan enormous accumulation of debris; though it does not follow that\r\nthe whole valley was filled by ice-action to the same depth; the\r\neffect of glaciers being to deposit moraines between themselves and\r\nthe sides of the valley they fill; as also to push forward similar\r\naccumulations. Glaciers from each valley, meeting at the fork, where\r\ntheir depth would be 700 feet of ice, would both deposit the\r\nnecessary accumulation along the flanks of the great valley, and also\r\nthrow a barrier across it. The melting waters of such glaciers would\r\naccumulate in lakes, confined by the frozen earth, between the\r\nmoraines and mountains. Such lakes, though on a small scale, are\r\nfound at the terminations and sides of existing glaciers, and are\r\nsurrounded by terraces of shingle and debris; these terraces being\r\nlaid bare by the sudden drainage of the lakes during seasons of\r\nunusual warmth. To explain the phenomena of the Yangma valley, it may\r\nbe necessary to demand larger lakes and deeper accumulations of\r\ndebris than are now familiar to us, but the proofs of glaciers having\r\nonce descended to from 8000 to 10,000 feet in every Sikkim and east\r\nNepal valley communicating with mountains above 16,000 feet\r\nelevation, are overwhelming, and the glaciers must, in some cases,\r\nhave been fully forty miles long, and 500 feet in depth. The absence\r\nof any remains of a moraine, or of blocks of rock in the valley below\r\nthe fork, is I believe, the only apparent objection to this theory;\r\nbut, as I shall elsewhere have occasion to observe, the magnitude of\r\nthe moraines bears no fixed proportion to that of the glacier, and at\r\nPabuk, the steep ridges of debris, which were heaped up 200 feet\r\nhigh, were far more striking than the more usual form of moraine.\r\n\r\nOn my way up to Yangma I had rudely plotted the valley, and selected\r\nprominent positions for improving my plan on my return: these I now\r\nmade use of, taking bearings with the azimuth compass, and angles by\r\nmeans of a pocket sextant. The result of my running-survey of the\r\nwhole valley, from 10,000 to 16,000 feet, I have given along with a\r\nsketch-map of my routes in India, which accompanies this volume.\r\n\r\nIllustration--SKULLS OF OVIS AMMON.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nAscend to Nango mountain -- Moraines -- Glaciers -- Vegetation --\r\n_Rhododendron Hodgsoni_ -- Rocks -- Honey-combed surface of snow --\r\nPerpetual snow -- Top of pass -- View -- Elevation -- Geology --\r\nDistance of sound -- Plants -- Temperature -- Scenery -- Cliffs of\r\ngranite and hurled boulders -- Camp -- Descent -- Pheasants -- Larch\r\n-- Himalayan pines -- Distribution of Deodar, note on --\r\nTassichooding temples -- Kambachen village -- Cultivation -- Moraines\r\nin valley, distribution of -- Picturesque lake-beds, and their\r\nvegetation -- Tibetan sheep and goats -- _Cryptogramma crispa_ --\r\nAscent to Choonjerma pass -- View of Junnoo -- Rocks of its summit --\r\nMisty ocean -- Nepal peaks -- Top of pass -- Temperature, and\r\nobservations -- Gorgeous sunset -- Descent to Yalloong valley --\r\nLoose path -- Night scenes -- Musk deer.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night a few miles below the great moraine, in a\r\npine-wood (alt. 11,000 feet) opposite the gorge which leads to the\r\nKambachen or Nango pass, over the south shoulder of the mountain of\r\nthat name: it is situated on a ridge dividing the Yangma river from\r\nthat of Kambachen, which latter falls into the Tambur opposite Lelyp.\r\n\r\nThe road crosses the Yangma (which is about fifteen feet wide), and\r\nimmediately ascends steeply to the south-east, over a rocky moraine,\r\nclothed with a dense thicket of rhododendrons, mountain-ash, maples,\r\npine, birch, juniper, etc. The ground was covered with silvery flakes\r\nof birch bark, and that of _Rhododendron Hodgsoni,_ which is as\r\ndelicate as tissue-paper, and of a pale flesh-colour. I had never\r\nbefore met with this species, and was astonished at the beauty of its\r\nfoliage, which was of a beautiful bright green, with leaves sixteen\r\ninches long.\r\n\r\nBeyond the region of trees and large shrubs the alpine rhododendrons\r\nfilled the broken surface of the valley, growing with _Potentilla,_\r\nHoneysuckle, _Polygonum,_ and dwarf juniper. The peak of Nango seemed\r\nto tower over the gorge, rising behind some black, splintered, rocky\r\ncliffs, sprinkled with snow, narrow defiles opened up through these\r\ncliffs to blue glaciers, and their mouths were invariably closed by\r\nbeds of shingly moraines, curving outwards from either, flank in\r\nconcentric ridges.\r\n\r\nTowards the base of the peak, at about 14,000 feet, the scenery is\r\nvery grand; a great moraine rises suddenly to the north-west, under\r\nthe principal mass of snow and ice, and barren slopes of gravel\r\ndescend from it; on either side are rugged precipices; the ground is\r\nbare and stony, with patches of brown grass: and, on looking back,\r\nthe valley appears very steep to the first shrubby vegetation, of\r\ndark green rhododendrons, bristling with ugly stunted pines.\r\n\r\nWe followed a valley to the south-east, so as to turn the flank of\r\nthe peak; the path lying over beds of October snow at 14,000 feet,\r\nand over plashy ground, from its melting. Sometimes our way lay close\r\nto the black precipices on our right, under which the snow was deep;\r\nand we dragged ourselves along, grasping every prominence of the rock\r\nwith our numbed fingers. Granite appeared in large veins in the\r\ncrumpled gneiss at a great elevation, in its most beautiful and\r\nloosely-crystallised form, of pearly white prisms of felspar, glassy\r\nquartz, and milk-white flat plates of mica, with occasionally large\r\ncrystals of tourmaline. Garnets were very frequent in the gneiss near\r\nthe granite veins. Small rushes, grasses, and sedges formed the\r\nremaining vegetation, amongst which were the withered stalks of\r\ngentians, _Sedum, Arenaria, Silene,_ and many Composite plants.\r\n\r\nAt a little below 15,000 feet, we reached enormous flat beds of snow,\r\nwhich were said to be perpetual, but covered deeply with the October\r\nfall. They were continuous, and like all the snow I saw at this\r\nseason, the surface was honeycombed into thin plates, dipping north\r\nat a high angle; the intervening fissures were about six inches deep.\r\nA thick mist here overtook us, and this, with the great difficulty\r\nof picking our way, rendered the ascent very fatiguing.\r\nBeing sanguine about obtaining a good view, I found it almost\r\nimpossible to keep my temper under the aggravations of pain in the\r\nforehead, lassitude, oppression of breathing, a dense drizzling fog,\r\na keen cold wind, a slippery footing, where I was stumbling at every\r\nfew steps, and icy-cold wet feet, hands, and eyelids; the latter, odd\r\nas it sounds, I found a very disagreeable accompaniment of continued\r\nraw cold wind.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour and a half's toilsome ascent, during which we made but\r\nlittle progress, we reached the crest, crossing a broad shelf of snow\r\nbetween two rocky eminences; the ridge was unsnowed a little way down\r\nthe east flank; this was, in a great measure, due to the eastern\r\nexposure being the more sunny, to the prevalence of the warm and\r\nmelting south-east winds that blow up the deep Kambachen valley, and\r\nto the fact that the great snow-beds on the west side are drifted\r\naccumulations.* [Such enormous beds of snow in depressions, or on\r\ngentle slopes, are generally adopted as indicating the lower limit of\r\nperpetual snow. They are, however, winter accumulations, due mainly\r\nto eddies of wind, of far more snow than can be melted in the\r\nfollowing summer, being hence perennial in the ordinary sense of the\r\nword. They pass into the state of glacier ice, and, obeying the laws\r\nthat govern the motions of a viscous fluid, so admirably elucidated\r\nby Forbes (\"Travels in the Alps\"), they flow downwards. A careful\r\nexamination of those great beds of snow in the Alps, from whose\r\nposition the mean lower level of perpetual snow, in that latitude, is\r\ndeduced, has convinced me that these are mainly due to accumulations\r\nof this kind, and that the true limit of perpetual snow, or that\r\npoint where all that falls melts, is much higher than it is usually\r\nsupposed to be.]  The mist cleared off, and I had a partial, though\r\nlimited, view. To the north the blue ice-clad peak of Nango was still\r\n2000 feet above us, its snowy mantle falling in great sweeps and\r\ncurves into glacier-bound valleys, over which the ice streamed out of\r\nsight, bounded by black aiguilles of gneiss. The Yangma valley was\r\nquite hidden, but to the eastward the view across the stupendous\r\ngorge of the Kambachen, 5000 feet below, to the waste of snow, ice,\r\nand rock, piled in confusion along the top of the range of Junnoo and\r\nChoonjerma, parallel to this but higher, was very grand indeed: this\r\nwe were to cross in two days, and its appearance was such, that our\r\nguide doubted the possibility of our doing it. A third and fourth\r\nmountain mass (unseen) lay beyond this, between us and Sikkim,\r\ndivided by valleys as deep as those of Yangma and Kambachen.\r\n\r\nHaving hung up my instruments, I ascended a few hundred feet to some\r\nnaked rocks, to the northward; they were of much-crumpled and\r\ndislocated gneiss, thrown up at a very high angle, and striking\r\nnorth-west. Chlorite, schist, and quartz, in thin beds, alternated\r\nwith the gneiss, and veins of granite and quartz, were injected\r\nthrough them.\r\n\r\nIt fell calm; when the distance to which the voice was carried was\r\nvery remarkable; I could distinctly hear every word spoken 300 to 400\r\nyards off, and did not raise my voice when I asked one of the men to\r\nbring me a hammer.\r\n\r\nThe few plants about were generally small tufted _Arenarias_ and\r\nwoolly _Compositae,_ with a thick-rooted Umbellifer that spread its\r\nshort, fleshy leaves and branches flat on the ground; the root was\r\nvery aromatic, but wedged close in the rock. The temperature at\r\n4 p.m. was 23 degrees, and bitterly cold; the elevation, 15,770 feet;\r\ndew-point, 16 degrees. The air was not very dry; saturation-point,\r\n0.670°, whereas at Calcutta it was 0.498° at the same hour.\r\n\r\nThe descent was to a broad, open valley, into which the flank of\r\nNango dipped in tremendous precipices, which reared their heads in\r\nsplintered snowy peaks. At their bases were shoots of debris fully\r\n700 feet high, sloping at a steep angle. Enormous masses of rock,\r\ndetached by the action of the frost and ice from the crags, were\r\nscattered over the bottom of the valley; they had been precipitated\r\nfrom above, and gaining impetus in their descent, bad been hurled to\r\nalmost inconceivable distances from the parent cliff. All were of a\r\nvery white, fine-grained crystallised granite, full of small veins of\r\nthe same rock still more finely crystallised. The weathered surface\r\nof each block was black, and covered with moss and lichens; the\r\nothers beautifully white, with clean, sharp-fractured edges.\r\nThe material of which they were composed was so hard that I found it\r\ndifficult to detach a specimen.\r\n\r\nDarkness had already come on, and the coolies being far behind, we\r\nencamped by the light of the moon, shining through a thin fog, where\r\nwe first found dwarf-juniper for fuel, at 13,500 feet. A little sleet\r\nfell during the night, which was tolerably fine, and not very cold;\r\nthe minimum thermometer indicating 14.5 degrees.\r\n\r\nHaving no tent-poles, I had some difficulty in getting my blankets\r\narranged as a shelter, which was done by making them slant from the\r\nside of a boulder, on the top of which one end was kept by heavy\r\nstones; under this roof I laid my bed, on a mass of rhododendron and\r\njuniper-twigs. The men did the same against other boulders, and\r\nlighting a huge fire opposite the mouth of my ground-nest, I sat\r\ncross-legged on the bed to eat my supper; my face scorching, and my\r\nback freezing. Rice, boiled with a few ounces of greasy _dindon aux\r\ntruffes_ was now my daily dinner, with chili-vinegar and tea, and I\r\nused to relish it keenly: this finished, I smoked a cigar, and wrote\r\nup my journal (in short intervals between warming myself) by the\r\nlight of the fire; took observations by means of a dark-lantern; and\r\nwhen all this was accomplished, I went to roost.\r\n\r\n_December_ 5.--On looking out this morning, it was with a feeling of\r\nawe that I gazed at the stupendous ice-crowned precipices that shot\r\nup to the summit of Nango, their flanks spotted white at the places\r\nwhence the gigantic masses with which I was surrounded had fallen;\r\nthence my eye wandered down their black faces to the slope of debris\r\nat the bottom, thus tracing the course which had probably been taken\r\nby that rock under whose shelter I had passed the previous night.\r\n\r\nMeepo, the Lepcha sent by the rajah, had snared a couple of beautiful\r\npheasants, one of which I skinned, and ate for breakfast; it is a\r\nsmall bird, common above 12,000 feet, but very wild; the male has two\r\nto five spurs on each of its legs, according to its age; the general\r\ncolour is greenish, with a broad scarlet patch surrounding the eye;\r\nthe Nepalese name is \"Khalidge.\" The crop was distended with juniper\r\nberries, of which the flesh tasted strongly, and it was the very\r\nhardest, toughest bird I ever did eat.\r\n\r\nWe descended at first through rhododendron and juniper, then through\r\nblack silver-fir (_Abies Webbiana_), and below that, near the river,\r\nwe came to the Himalayan larch; a tree quite unknown, except from a\r\nnotice in the journals of Mr. Griffith, who found it in Bhotan. It is\r\na small tree, twenty to forty feet high, perfectly similar in general\r\ncharacters to a European larch, but with larger cones, which are\r\nerect upon the very long, pensile, whip-like branches; its\r\nleaves,--now red--were falling, and covering the rocky ground on\r\nwhich it grew, scattered amongst other trees. It is called \"Saar\" by\r\nthe Lepchas and Cis-himalayan Tibetans, and \"Boarga-sella\" by the\r\nNepalese, who say it is found as far west as the heads of the Cosi\r\nriver: it does not inhabit Central or West Nepal, nor the North-west\r\nHimalaya. The distribution of the Himalayan pines is very remarkable.\r\nThe Deodar has not been seen east of Nepal, nor the _Pinus\r\nGerardiana, Cupressus torulosa,_ or _Juniperus communis._ On the\r\nother hand, _Podocarpus_ is confined to the east of Katmandoo. _Abies\r\nBrunoniana_ does not occur west of the Gogra, nor the larch west of\r\nthe Cosi, nor funereal cypress (an introduced plant, however) west of\r\nthe Teesta (in Sikkim). Of the twelve* [Juniper, 3; yew, _Abies\r\nWebbiana, Brunoniana,_ and _Smithiana_: Larch, _Pinus excelsa,_ and\r\n_longifolia,_ and _Podocarpus neriifolia._] Sikkim and Bhotan\r\n_Coniferae_ (including yew, junipers, and _Podocarpus_) eight are\r\ncommon to the North-west Himalaya (west of Nepal), and four* [Larch,\r\n_Cupressus funebris, Podocarpus neriifolia, Abies Brunoniana._] are\r\nnot: of the thirteen natives of the north-west provinces, again, only\r\nfive* [A juniper (the European _communis_), Deodar (possibly only a\r\nvariety of the Cedar of Lebanon and of Mount Atlas), _Pinus\r\nGerardiana, P. excelsa,_ and _Crupressus torulosa._] are not found in\r\nSikkim, and I have given their names below, because they show how\r\nEuropean the absent ones are, either specifically or in affinity.\r\nI have stated that the Deodar is possibly a variety of the Cedar of\r\nLebanon. This is now a prevalent opinion, which is strengthened by\r\nthe fact that so many more Himalayan plants are now ascertained to be\r\nEuropean than had been supposed before they were compared with\r\nEuropean specimens; such are the yew, _Juniperus communis, Berberis\r\nvulgaris, Quercus Ballota, Populus alba_ and _Euphratica,_ etc.\r\nThe cones of the Deodar are identical with those of the Cedar of\r\nLebanon: the Deodar has, generally longer and more pale bluish leaves\r\nand weeping branches,* [Since writing the above, I have seen, in the\r\nmagnificent Pinetum at Dropmore, noble cedars, with the length and\r\nhue of leaf, and the pensile branches of the Deodar, and far more\r\nbeautiful than that is, and as unlike the common Lebanon Cedar as\r\npossible. When it is considered from how very few wild trees (and\r\nthese said to be exactly alike) the many dissimilar varieties of the\r\n_C. Libani_ have been derived; the probability of this, the Cedar of\r\nAlgiers, and of the Himalayas (Deodar) being all forms of one\r\nspecies, is greatly increased. We cannot presume to judge from the\r\nfew cedars which still remain, what the habit and appearance of the\r\ntree may have been, when it covered the slopes of Libanus, and seeing\r\nhow very variable _Coniferae_ are in habit, we may assume that its\r\nsurviving specimens give us no information on this head. Should all\r\nthree prove one, it will materially enlarge our ideas of the\r\ndistribution and variation of species. The botanist will insist that\r\nthe typical form of cedar is that which retains its characters best\r\nover the greatest area, namely, the Deodar; in which case the\r\nprejudice of the ignorant, and the preconceived ideas of the\r\nnaturalist, must yield to the fact that the old familiar Cedar of\r\nLebanon is an unusual variety of the Himalayan Deodar.] but these\r\ncharacters seem to be unusually developed in our gardens; for several\r\ngentlemen, well acquainted with the Deodar at Simla, when asked to\r\npoint it out in the Kew Gardens, have indicated the Cedar of Lebanon,\r\nand when shown the Deodar, declare that they never saw that plant in\r\nthe Himalaya!\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the valley we turned up the stream, and passing the\r\nTassichooding convents* [These were built by the Sikkim people, when\r\nthe eastern valleys of Nepal belonged to the Sikkim rajah.] and\r\ntemple, crossed the river--which was a furious torrent, about twelve\r\nyards wide--to the village of Kambachen, on a flat terrace a few feet\r\nabove the stream. There were about a dozen houses of wood, plastered\r\nwith mud and dung, scattered over a grassy plain of a few acres,\r\nfenced in, as were also a few fields, with stone dykes. The only\r\ncultivation consists of radishes, potatos, and barley: no wheat is\r\ngrown, the climate being said to be too cold for it, by which is\r\nprobably meant that it is foggy,--the elevation (11,380 feet) being\r\n2000 feet less than that of Yangma village, and the temperature\r\ntherefore 6 degrees to 7 degrees warmer; but of all the mountain\r\ngorges I have ever visited, this is by far the wildest, grandest, and\r\nmost gloomy; and that man should hybernate here is indeed\r\nextraordinary, for there is no route up the valley, and all\r\ncommunication with Lelyp,* [Which I passed, on the Tambur, on the\r\n21st Nov. See Chapter IX.] two marches down the river, is cut off in\r\nwinter, when the houses are buried in snow, and drifts fifteen feet\r\ndeep are said to be common. Standing on the little flat of Kambachen,\r\nprecipices, with inaccessible patches of pine wood, appeared to the\r\nwest, towering over head; while across the narrow valley wilder and\r\nless wooded crags rose in broken ridges to the glaciers of Nango.\r\nUp the valley, the view was cut off by bluff cliffs; whilst down it,\r\nthe scene was most remarkable: enormous black, round-backed moraines,\r\nrose, tier above tier, from a flat lake-bed, apparently hemming in\r\nthe river between the lofty precipices on the east flank of the\r\nvalley. These had all been deposited at the mouth of a lateral\r\nvalley, opening just below the village, and descending from Junnoo, a\r\nmountain of 25,312 feet elevation, and one of the grandest of the\r\nKinchinjunga group, whose top--though only five miles distant in a\r\nstraight line--rises 13,932 feet* [This is one of the most sudden\r\nslopes in this part of the Himalaya, the angle between the top of\r\nJunnoo and Kambachen being 2786 feet per mile, or 1 in 1.8. The slope\r\nfrom the top of Mont Blanc to the Chamouni valley is 2464 feet per\r\nmile, or 1 in 2.1. That from Monte Rosa top to Macugnaga greatly\r\nexceeds either.] above the village. Few facts show more decidedly the\r\nextraordinary steepness and depth of the Kambachen valley near the\r\nvillage, which, though nearly 11,400 feet above the sea, lies between\r\ntwo mountains only eight miles apart, the one 25,312 feet high, the\r\nother (Nango), 19,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe villagers received us very kindly, and furnished us with a guide\r\nfor the Choonjerma pass, leading to the Yalloong valley, the most\r\neasterly in Nepal; but he recommended our not attempting any part of\r\nthe ascent till the morrow, as it was past 1 p.m., and we should find\r\nno camping-ground for half the way up. The villagers gave us the leg\r\nof a musk deer, and some red potatos, about as big as walnuts--all\r\nthey could spare from their winter-stock. With this scanty addition\r\nto our stores we started down the valley, for a few miles alternately\r\nalong flat lake-beds and over moraines, till we crossed the stream\r\nfrom the lateral valley, and ascending a little, camped on its bank,\r\nat 11,400 feet elevation.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I botanized amongst the moraines, which were very\r\nnumerous, and had been thrown down at right-angles to the main\r\nvalley, which latter being here very narrow, and bounded by lofty\r\nprecipices, must have stopped the parent glaciers, and effected the\r\nheaping of some of these moraines to at least 1000 feet above the\r\nriver. The general features were modifications of those seen in the\r\nYangma valley, but contracted into a much smaller space.\r\n\r\nThe moraines were all accumulated in a sort of delta, through which\r\nthe lateral river debouched into the Kambachen, and were all\r\ndeposited more or less parallel to the course of the lateral valley,\r\nbut curving outwards from its mouth. The village-flat, or terrace,\r\ncontinued level to the first moraine, which had been thrown down on\r\nthe upper or north side of the lateral valley, on whose and curving\r\nsteep flanks it abutted, and curving outwards seemed to encircle the\r\nvillage-flat on the south and west; where it dipped into the river.\r\nThis was crossed at the height of about 100 feet, by a stony path,\r\nleading to the bed of the rapid torrent flowing through shingle and\r\nboulders, beyond which was another moraine, 250 feet high, and\r\nparallel to it a third gigantic one.\r\n\r\nAscending the great moraine at a place where it overhung the main\r\nriver, I had a good _coup-a'oeil_ of the whole. The view south-east\r\nup the glacial valley--(represented in the accompanying cut)--to the\r\nsnowy peaks south of Junnoo, was particularly grand, and most\r\ninteresting from the precision with which one great distant existing\r\nglacier was marked by two waving parallel lines of lateral moraines,\r\nwhich formed, as it were, a vast raised gutter, or channel, ascending\r\nfrom perhaps 16,000 feet elevation, till it was hidden behind a spur\r\nin the valley. With a telescope I could descry many similar smaller\r\nglaciers, with huge accumulations of shingle at their terminations;\r\nbut this great one was beautifully seen by the naked eye, and formed\r\na very curious feature in the landscape.\r\n\r\nIllustration--ANCIENT MORAINES IN THE RAMBACHEN VALLEY.\r\n\r\n Between the moraines, near my tent, the soil was perfectly level,\r\nand consisted of little lake-beds strewn with gigantic boulders, and\r\ncovered with hard turf of grass and sedge, and little bushes of dwarf\r\nrhododendron and prostrate juniper, as trim as if they had been\r\nclipped. Altogether these formed the most picturesque little nooks it\r\nwas possible to conceive; and they exhibited the withered remains of\r\nso many kinds of primrose, gentian, anemone, potentilla, orchis,\r\nsaxifrage, parnassia, campanula, and pedicularis, that in summer they\r\nmust be perfect gardens of wild flowers. Around each plot of a few\r\nacres was the grand ice-transported girdle of stupendous rocks, many\r\nfrom 50 to 100 feet long, crested with black tabular-branched silver\r\nfirs, conical deep green tree-junipers, and feathery larches; whilst\r\namongst the blocks grew a profusion of round masses of evergreen\r\nrhododendron bushes. Beyond were stupendous frowning cliffs, beneath\r\nwhich the river roared like thunder; and looking up the glacial\r\nvalley, the setting sun was bathing the expanse of snow in the most\r\ndelicate changing tints, pink, amber, and gold.\r\n\r\nThe boulders forming the moraine were so enormous and angular, that I\r\nhad great difficulty in ascending it. I saw some pheasants feeding on\r\nthe black berries of the juniper, but where the large rhododendrons\r\ngrew amongst the rocks I found it impossible to penetrate.\r\nThe largest of the moraines is piled to upwards of 1000 feet against\r\nthe south flank of the lateral valley, and stretched far up it beyond\r\nmy camp, which was in a grove of silver firs. A large flock of sheep\r\nand goats, laden with salt, overtook us here on their route from\r\nWallanchoon to Yalloong. The sheep I observed to feed on the\r\n_Rhododendron Thomsoni_ and _campylocarpum. On the roots of one of\r\nthe latter species a parasitical Broom-rape (_Orobanche_) grew\r\nabundantly; and about the moraines were more mosses, lichens, etc.,\r\nthan I have elsewhere seen in the loftier Himalaya, encouraged no\r\ndoubt by the dampness of this grand mountain gorge, which is so\r\nhemmed in that the sun never reaches it until four or five hours\r\nafter it has gilded the overhanging peaks.\r\n\r\n_December_ 5.--The morning was bright and clear, and we left early\r\nfor the Choonjerma pass. I had hoped the route would be up the\r\nmagnificent glacier-girdled valley in which we had encamped; but it\r\nlay up another, considerably south of it, and to which we crossed,\r\nascending the rocky moraine, in the clefts of which grew abundance of\r\na common Scotch fern, _Cryptogramma crispa_!\r\n\r\nThe clouds early commenced gathering, and it was curious to watch\r\ntheir rapid formation in coalescing streaks, which became first\r\ncirrhi, and then stratus, being apparently continually added to from\r\nbelow by the moisture-bringing southerly wind. Ascending a lofty\r\nspur, 1000 feet above the valley, against which the moraine was\r\nbanked, I found it to be a distinct anticlinal axis. The pass,\r\nbearing north-west, and the valley we had descended on the previous\r\nday, rose immediately over the curved strata of quartz, topped by the\r\nglacier-crowned mountain of Nango, with four glaciers descending from\r\nits perpetual snows. The stupendous cliffs on its flanks, under which\r\nI had camped on the previous night, were very grand, but not more so\r\nthan those which dipped into the chasm of the Kambachen below.\r\nLooking up the valley of the latter, was another wilderness of ice\r\nfull of enormous moraines, round the bases of which the river wound.\r\n\r\nAscending, we reached an open grassy valley, and overtook the\r\nTibetans who had preceded us, and who had halted here to feed their\r\nsheep. A good-looking girl of the party came to ask me for medicine\r\nfor her husband's eyes, which had suffered from snow-blindness: she\r\nbrought me a present of snuff, and carried a little child, stark\r\nnaked, yet warm from the powerful rays of the sun, at nearly 14,000\r\nfeet elevation, in December! I prescribed for the man, and gave the\r\nmother a bright farthing to hang round the child's neck, which\r\ndelighted the party. My watch was only wondered at; but a little\r\nspring measuring-tape that rolled itself up, struck them dumb, and\r\nwhen I threw it on the ground with the tape out, the mother shrieked\r\nand ran away, while the little savage howled after her.\r\n\r\nAbove, the path up the ascent was blocked with snowbeds, and for\r\nseveral miles we alternately scrambled among rocks and over slippery\r\nslopes, to the top of the first ridge, there being two to cross.\r\nThe first consisted of a ridge of rocks running east and west from a\r\nsuperb sweep of snowy mountains to the north-west, which presented a\r\nchaotic scene of blue glacial ice and white snow, through which\r\nsplintered rocks and beetling crags thrust their black heads.\r\nThe view into the Kambachen gorge was magnificent, though it did not\r\nreveal the very bottom of the valley and its moraines: the black\r\nprecipices of its opposite flank seemed to rise to the glaciers of\r\nNango, fore-shortened into snow-capped precipices 5000 feet high,\r\namongst which lay the Kambachen pass, bearing north-west by north.\r\nLower down the valley, appeared a broad flat, called Jubla, a\r\nhalting-place one stage below the village of Kambachen, on the road\r\nto Lelyp on the Tambur: it must be a remarkable geological as well as\r\nnatural feature, fao it appeared to jut abruptly and quite\r\nhorizontally from the black cliffs of the valley.\r\n\r\nLooking north, the conical head of Junnoo was just scattering the\r\nmists from its snowy shoulders, and standing forth to view, the most\r\nmagnificent spectacle I ever beheld. It was quite close to me,\r\nbearing north-east by east, and subtending an angle of 12 degrees 23,\r\nand is much the steepest and most conical of all the peaks of these\r\nregions. From whichever side it is viewed, it rises 9000 feet above\r\nthe general mountain mass of 16,000 feet elevation, towering like a\r\nblunt cone, with a short saddle on one side, that dips in a steep\r\ncliff: it appeared as if uniformly snowed, from its rocks above\r\n20,000 feet (like those of Kinchinjunga) being of white granite, and\r\nnot contrasting with the snow. Whether the top is stratified or not,\r\nI cannot tell, but waving parallel lines are very conspicuous near\r\nit, as shown in the accompanying view.* [The appearance of Mont\r\nCervin, from the Riffelberg, much reminded me of that of Junnoo, from\r\nthe Choonjerma pass, the former bearing the same relation to Monte\r\nRosa that the latter does to Kinchinjunga. Junnoo, though\r\nincomparably the more stupendous mass, not only rising 10,000 feat\r\nhigher above the sea, but towering 4000 feet higher above the ridge\r\non which it is supported, is not nearly so remarkable in outline, so\r\nsharp, or so peaked as is Mount Cervin: it is a very much grander,\r\nbut far less picturesque object. The whiteness of the sides of Junnoo\r\nadds also greatly to its apparent altitude; while the strong relief\r\nin which the black cliffs of Mont Cervin protrude through its snowy\r\nmantle greatly diminish both its apparent height and distance.]\r\n\r\nIllustration--JUNNOO 24,000 FT. FROM CHOONJERMA PASS 16,000 FT. EAST\r\nNEPAL.\r\n\r\nLooking south as evening drew on, another wonderful spectacle\r\npresented itself, similar to that which I described at Sakkiazung,\r\nbut displayed here on an inconceivably grander scale, with all the\r\neffects exaggerated. I saw a sea of mist floating 3000 feet beneath\r\nme, just below the upper level of the black pines; the magnificent\r\nspurs of the snowy range which I had crossed rising out of it in\r\nrugged grandeur as promontories and peninsulas, between which the\r\nmisty ocean seemed to finger up like the fiords of Norway, or the\r\nsalt-water lochs of the west of Scotland; whilst islets tailed off\r\nfrom the promontories, rising here and there out of the deceptive\r\nelements. I was so high above this mist, that it had not the billowy\r\nappearance I saw before, but was a calm unruffled ocean, boundless to\r\nthe south and west, where the horizon over-arched it. A little to the\r\nnorth of west I discerned the most lofty group of mountains in Nepal*\r\n[Called Tsungau by the Bhoteeas. Junnoo is called Kumbo Kurma by the\r\nHill-men of Nepal.] (mentioned at Chapter VIII), beyond Kinchinjurga,\r\nwhich I believe are on the west flank of the great valley through\r\nwhich the Arun river enters Nepal from Tibet: they were very distant,\r\nand subtended so small an angle, that I could not measure them with\r\nthe sextant and artificial horizon their height, judging from the\r\nquantity of snow, must be prodigious.\r\n\r\nFrom 4 to 5 p.m. the temperature was 24 degrees, with a very cold\r\nwind; the elevation by the barometer was 15,260 feet, and the\r\ndew-point 10.5 degrees, giving the humidity 0.610, and the amount of\r\nvapour 1.09 grains in a cubic foot of air; the same elements at\r\nCalcutta, at the same hour, being thermometer 66.5 degrees, dew-point\r\n60.5 degrees, humidity 0.840, and weight of vapour 5.9 grains.\r\n\r\nI waited for an hour, examining the rocks about the pass, till the\r\ncoolies should come up, but saw nothing worthy of remark, the natural\r\nhistory and geology being identical with those of Kambachen pass: I\r\nthen bade adieu to the sublime and majestic peak of Junnoo. Thence we\r\ncontinued at nearly the same level for about four miles, dipping into\r\nthe broad head of a snowy valley, and ascending to the second pass,\r\nwhich lay to the south-east.\r\n\r\nOn the left I passed a very curious isolated pillar of rock, amongst\r\nthe wild crags to the north-east, whose bases we skirted: it\r\nresembles the Capuchin on the shoulder of Mont Blanc, as seen from\r\nthe Jardin. Evening overtook us while still on the snow near the last\r\nascent. As the sun declined, the snow at our feet reflected the most\r\nexquisitely delicate peach-bloom hue; and looking west from the top\r\nof the pass, the scenery was gorgeous beyond description, for the sun\r\nwas just plunging into a sea of mist, amongst some cirrhi and\r\nstratus, all in a blaze of the ruddiest coppery hue. As it sank, the\r\nNepal, peaks to the right assumed more definite, darker, and gigantic\r\nforms, and floods of light shot across the misty ocean, bathing the\r\nlandscape around me in the most wonderful and indescribable changing\r\ntints. As the luminary was vanishing, the whole horizon glowed like\r\ncopper run from a smelting furnace, and when it had quite\r\ndisappeared, the little inequalities of the ragged edges of the mist\r\nwere lighted up and shone like a row of volcanos in the far distance.\r\nI have never before or since seen anything, which for sublimity,\r\nbeauty, and marvellous effects, could compare with what I gazed on\r\nthat evening from Choonjerma pass. In some of Turner's pictures I\r\nhave recognized similar effects, caught and fixed by a marvellous\r\neffort of genius; such are the fleeting hues over the ice, in his\r\n\"Whalers,\" and the ruddy fire in his \"Wind, Steam, and Rain,\" which\r\none almost fears to touch. Dissolving views give some idea of the\r\nmagic creation and dispersion of the effects, but any combination of\r\nscience and art can no more recall the scene, than it can the\r\nfeelings of awe that crept over me, during the hour I spent in\r\nsolitude amongst these stupendous mountains.\r\n\r\nThe moon guided us on our descent, which was to the south, obliquely\r\ninto the Yalloong valley. I was very uneasy about the coolies, who\r\nwere far behind, and some of them had been frost-bitten in crossing\r\nthe Kambachen pass. Still I thought the best thing was to push on,\r\nand light large fires at the first juniper we should reach.\r\nThe change, on passing from off the snow to the dark earth and rock,\r\nwas so bewildering, that I had great difficulty in picking my way.\r\nSuddenly we came on a flat with a small tarn, whose waters gleamed\r\nillusively in the pale moonlight: the opposite flanks of the valley\r\nwere so well reflected on its gloomy surface, that we were at once\r\nbrought to a stand-still on its banks: it looked like a chasm, and\r\nwhether to jump across it, or go down it, or along it, was the\r\nquestion, so deceptive was the spectral landscape. Its true nature\r\nwas, however, soon discovered, and we proceeded round it, descending.\r\nOf course there was no path, and after some perplexity amongst rocks\r\nand ravines, we reached the upper limit of wood, and halted by some\r\nbleached juniper-trees, which were soon converted into blazing fires.\r\n\r\nI wandered away from my party to listen for the voices of the men who\r\nhad lingered behind, about whom I was still more anxious, from the\r\nvery great difficulty they would encounter if, as we did, they should\r\nget off the path. The moon was shining clearly in the black heavens;\r\nand its bright light, with the pale glare of the surrounding snow,\r\nobscured the milky way, and all the smaller stars; whilst the planets\r\nappeared to glow with broader orbs than elsewhere, and the great\r\nstars flashed steadily and periodically.\r\n\r\nDeep black chasms seemed to yawn below, and cliffs rose on all sides,\r\nexcept down the valley, where looking across the Yalloong river, a\r\nsteep range of mountains rose, seamed with torrents that were just\r\nvisible like threads of silver coursing down broad landslips. It was\r\na dead calm, and nothing broke the awful silence but the low hoarse\r\nmurmur of many torrents, whose mingled voices rose and fell as if\r\nwith the pulsations of the atmosphere; the undulations of which\r\nappeared thus to be marked by the ear alone. Sometimes it was the\r\nfaintest possible murmur, and then it rose swelling and filling the\r\nair with sound: the effect was that of being raised from the earth's\r\nsurface, and again lowered to it; or that of waters advancing and\r\nretiring. In such scenes and with such accompaniments, the mind\r\nwanders from the real to the ideal, the larger and brighter lamps of\r\nheaven lead us to imagine that we have risen from the surface of our\r\nglobe and are floating through the regions of space, and that the\r\nceaseless murmur of the waters is the Music of the Spheres.\r\n\r\nContemplation amid such soothing sounds and impressive scenes is very\r\nseductive, and withal very dangerous, for the temperature was at\r\nfreezing-point, my feet and legs were wet through, and it was well\r\nthat I was soon roused from my reveries by the monosyllabic\r\nexclamations of my coolies. They were quite knocked up, and came\r\nalong grunting, and halting every minute to rest, by supporting their\r\nloads, still hanging to their backs, on their stout staves. I had\r\nstill one bottle of brandy left, with which to splice the main brace.\r\nIt had been repeatedly begged for in vain, and being no longer\r\nexpected, was received with unfeigned joy. Fortunately with these\r\npeople a little spirits goes a long way, and I kept half for\r\nfuture emergencies.\r\n\r\nWe camped at 13,290 feet, the air was calm and mild to the feeling,\r\nthough the temperature fell to 22.75 degrees. On the following\r\nmorning we saw two musk-deer,* [There are two species of musk-deer in\r\nthe Himalaya, besides the Tibetan kind, which appears identical with\r\nthe Siberian animal originally described by Pallas.] called\r\n\"Kosturah\" by the mountaineers. The musk, which hangs in a pouch near\r\nthe navel of the male, is the well-known object of traffic with\r\nBengal. This creature ranges between 8000 and 13,000 feet, on the\r\nHimalaya, often scenting the air for many hundred yards. It is a\r\npretty grey animal, the size of a roebuck, and something resembling\r\nit, with coarse fur, short horns, and two projecting teeth from the\r\nupper jaw, said to be used in rooting up the aromatic herbs from\r\nwhich the Bhoteeas believe that it derives the odour of musk. This I\r\nmuch doubt, because the animal never frequents those very lofty\r\nregions where the herbs supposed to provide the scent are found, nor\r\nhave I ever seen signs of any having been so rooted up.\r\nThe _Delphinium glaciale_ smells strongly and disagreeably of musk,\r\nbut it is one of the most alpine plants in the world, growing at an\r\nelevation of 17,000 feet, far above the limits of the Kosturah.\r\nThe female and young male are very good eating, much better than any\r\nIndian venison I ever tasted, being sweet and tender. Mr. Hodgson\r\nonce kept a female alive, but it was very wild, and continued so as\r\nlong as I knew it. Two of my Lepchas gave chase to these animals, and\r\nfired many arrows in vain after them: these people are fond of\r\ncarrying a bow, but are very poor shots.\r\n\r\nWe descended 3000 feet to the deep valley of the Yalloong river which\r\nruns west-by-south to the Tambur, from between Junnoo and Kubra: the\r\npath was very bad, over quartz, granite, and gneiss, which cut the\r\nshoes and feet severely. The bottom of the valley, which is elevated\r\n10,450 feet, was filled with an immense accumulation of angular\r\ngravel and debris of the above rocks, forming on both sides of the\r\nriver a terrace 400 feet above the stream, which flowed in a furious\r\ntorrent. The path led over this deposit for a good many miles, and\r\nvaried exceedingly in height, in some places being evidently\r\nincreased by landslips, and at others apparently by moraines.\r\n\r\nIllustration--TIBETAN CHARM-BOX.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nYalloong valley -- Fiud Kanglanamo pass closed -- Change route for\r\nthe southward -- _Picrorhiza_ -- View of Kubra -- _Rhododendron\r\nFalconeri_ -- Yalloong river -- Junction of gneiss and clay-slate --\r\nCross Yalloong range -- View -- Descent -- Yew -- Vegetation -- Misty\r\nweather -- Tongdam village -- Khabang -- Tropical vegetation --\r\nSidingbah Mountain -- View of Kinchinjunga -- Yangyading village --\r\nSlopes of hills, and courses of rivers -- Khabili valley -- (Ghorkha\r\nHavildar's bad conduct -- Ascend Singalelah -- Plague of ticks --\r\nShort commons -- Cross Islumbo pass -- Boundary of Sikkim -- Kulhait\r\nvalley -- Lingeham -- Reception by Kajee -- Hear of Dr. Campbell's\r\ngoing to meet Rajah -- Views in valley -- Leave for Teesta river --\r\nTipsy Kajee -- Hospitality -- Murwa beer -- Temples -- _Acorus\r\nCalamus_ -- Long Mendong -- Burning of dead -- Superstitions -- Cross\r\nGreat Rungeet -- Boulders, origin of -- Purchase of a dog -- Marshes\r\n-- Lamas -- Dismiss Ghorkhas -- Bhoteea house -- Murwa beer.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the bottom we found a party who were travelling with\r\nsheep laden with salt; they told us that the Yalloong village, which\r\nlay up the valley on the route to the Kanglanamo pass (leading over\r\nthe south shoulder of Kubra into Sikkim) was deserted, the\r\ninhabitants having retired after the October fall of snow to\r\nYankutang, two marches down; also that the Kanglanamo pass was\r\nimpracticable, being always blocked up by the October fall. I was,\r\ntherefore, reluctantly obliged to abandon the plan of pursuing that\r\nroute to Sikkim, and to go south, following the west flank of\r\nSingalelah to the first of the many passes over it which I might\r\nfind open.\r\n\r\nThese people were very civil, and gave me a handful of the root of\r\none of the many bitter herbs called in Bengal \"Teeta,\" and used as a\r\nfebrifuge: the present was that of _Picrorhiza,_ a plant allied to\r\nSpeedwell, which grows at from 12,000 to 15,000 feet elevation, and\r\nis a powerful bitter, called \"Hoonling\" by the Tibetans. They had\r\nwith them above 100 sheep, of a tall, long-legged, Roman-nosed breed.\r\nEach carried upwards of forty pounds of salt, done up in two leather\r\nbags, slung on either side, and secured by a band going over the\r\nchest, and another round the loins, so that they cannot slip off,\r\nwhen going up or down hill. These sheep are very tame, patient\r\ncreatures, travelling twelve miles a day with great ease, and being\r\nindifferent to rocky or steep ground.\r\n\r\nLooking east I had a splendid view of the broad snowy mass of Kubra,\r\nblocking up, as it were, the head of the valley with a white screen.\r\nDescending to about 10,000 feet, the _Abies Brunoniana_ appeared,\r\nwith fine trees of _Rhododendron Falconeri_ forty feet high, and with\r\nleaves nineteen inches long! while the upper part of the valley was\r\nfull of _Abies Webbiana._\r\n\r\nAt the elevation of 9000 feet, we crossed to the east bank, and\r\npassed the junction of the gneiss and mica slate: the latter crossed\r\nthe river, striking north-west, and the stream cut a dark chasm-like\r\nchannel through it, foaming and dashing the spray over the splintered\r\nridges, and the broad water-worn hog-backed masses that projected\r\nfrom its bed. Immense veins of granite permeated the rocks, which\r\nwere crumpled in the strangest manner: isolated angular blocks of\r\nschist had been taken up by the granite in a fluid state, and\r\nremained imbedded in it.\r\n\r\nThe road made great ascents to avoid landslips, and to surmount the\r\nenormous piles of debris which encumber this valley more than any\r\nother. We encamped at 10,050 feet, on a little flat 1000 feet above\r\nthe bed of the  river, and on its east flank. A _Hydrangea_ was the\r\ncommon small wood, but _Abies Webbiana_ formed the forest, with great\r\nRhododendrons. The weather was foggy, whence I judged that we were in\r\nthe sea of mist I saw beneath me from the passes; the temperature,\r\nconsidering the elevation, was mild, 37 degrees and 38 degrees, which\r\nwas partly due to the evolution of heat that accompanies the\r\ncondensation of these vapours, the atmosphere being loaded with\r\nmoisture. The thermometer fell to 28 degrees during the night, and in\r\nthe morning the ground was thickly covered with hoar-frost.\r\n\r\n_December 7.--We ascended the Yalloong ridge to a saddle 11,000 feet\r\nelevation, whence the road dips south to the gloomy gorges of the\r\neastern feeders of the Tambur. Here we bade adieu to the grand alpine\r\nscenery, and for several days our course lay in Nepal in a southerly\r\ndirection, parallel to Singalelah, and crossing every spur and river\r\nsent off by that mighty range. The latter flow towards the Tambur,\r\nand their beds, for forty or fifty miles are elevated about 3000 or\r\n4000 feet. Few of the spurs are ascended above 5000 feet, but all of\r\nthem rise to 12,000 or 14,000 feet to the westward, where they join\r\nthe Singalelah range.\r\n\r\nI clambered to the top of a lofty hummock, through a dense thicket of\r\ninterwoven Rhododendron bushes, the clayey soil under which was\r\nslippery from the quantity of dead leaves. I had hoped for a view of\r\nthe top of Kinchinjunga, which bore north-east, but it was enveloped\r\nin clouds, as were all the snows in that direction; to the\r\nnorth-west, however, I obtained bearings of the principal peaks,\r\netc., of the Yangma and Kambachen valleys. To the south and\r\nsouth-east, lofty, rugged and pine-clad mountains rose in confused\r\nmasses, and white sheets of  mist came driving up, clinging to the\r\nmountain-tops, and shrouding the landscape with extreme rapidity.\r\nThe remarkable mountain of Sidingbah bore south-south-east, raising\r\nits rounded head above the clouds. I could, however, procure no\r\nother good bearing.\r\n\r\nThe descent from the Yalloong ridge to the Khabili feeders of the\r\nTambur was very steep, and in some places almost precipitous, first\r\nthrough dense woods of silver fir, with _Rhod. Falconeri_ and\r\n_Hodgsoni,_ then through _Abies Brunoniana,_ with yew (now covered\r\nwith red berries) to the region of Magnolias and _Rhod. arboreum_ and\r\n_barbatum._ One bush of the former was in flower, making a gorgeous\r\nshow. Here also appeared the great oak with lamellated acorns, which\r\nI had not seen in the drier valleys to the westward; with many other\r\nDorjiling trees and shrubs. A heavy mist clung to the rank luxuriant\r\nfoliage, tantalizing from its obscuring all the view. Mica schist\r\nreplaced the gneiss, and a thick slippery stratum of clay rendered it\r\nvery difficult to keep one's footing. After so many days of bright\r\nsunshine and dry weather, I found this quiet, damp, foggy atmosphere\r\nto have a most depressing effect: there was little to interest in the\r\nmeteorology, the atmospheric fluctuations being far too small;\r\ngeographical discovery was at an end, and we groped our way along\r\ndevious paths in wooded valleys, or ascended spurs and ridges, always\r\nclouded before noon, and clothed with heavy forest.\r\n\r\nAt 6000 feet we emerged from the mist, and found ourselves clambering\r\ndown a deep gully, hemmed in by frightful rocky steeps, which exposed\r\na fine and tolerably continuous section of schistose rocks, striking\r\nnorth-west, and dipping north-east, at a very high angle.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom three furious torrents met: we descended  the course of\r\none of them, over slanting precipices, or trees lashed to the rocks,\r\nand after a most winding course our path conducted us to the village\r\nof Tarbu, high above a feeder of the Khabili river, which flows west,\r\njoining the Tambur three days' march lower down. Having no food, we\r\nhad made a very long and difficult march to this place, but finding\r\nnone here, proceeded on to Tonghem village on the Khabili, descending\r\nthrough thickets of _Rhod. arboreum_ to the elevation of 5,560.\r\n\r\nThis village, or spur, called \"Tonghem\" by the Limboos, and\r\n\"Yankutang\" by the Bhoteeas, is the winter resort of the inhabitants\r\nof the upper Yalloong valley: they received us very kindly, sold us\r\ntwo fowls, and rice enough to last for one or two days, which was all\r\nthey could spare, and gave me a good deal of information. I found\r\nthat the Kanglanamo pass had been disused since the Nepal war, that\r\nit was very lofty, and always closed in October.\r\n\r\nThe night was fine, clear, and warm, but the radiation so powerful\r\nthat the grass was coated with ice the following morning, though the\r\nthermometer did not fall below 33 degrees. The next day the sun rose\r\nwith great power, and the vegetation reeked and steamed with the\r\nheat. Crossing the river, we first made a considerable descent, and\r\nthen ascended a ridge to 5,750 feet, through a thick jungle of\r\n_Camellia, Eurya,_ and small oak: from the top I obtained bearings of\r\nYalloong and Choonjerma pass, and had also glimpses of the Kinchin\r\nrange through a tantalizing jungle; after which a very winding and\r\nfatiguing up-and-down march southwards brought us to the village of\r\nKhabang, in the magnificent valley of the Tawa, about 800 feet above\r\nthe river, and 5,500 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nI halted here for a day, to refresh the people, and if possible to\r\nobtain some food. I hoped, too, to find a pass  into Sikkim, east\r\nover Singalelah, but was disappointed: if there had ever been one, it\r\nhad been closed since the Nepal war; and there was none, for several\r\nmarches further south, which would conduct us to the Iwa branch of\r\nthe Khabili.\r\n\r\nKhabang is a village of Geroongs, or shepherds, who pasture their\r\nflocks on the hills and higher valleys during summer, and bring them\r\ndown to this elevation in winter: the ground was consequently\r\ninfested with a tick, equal in size to that so common in the bushes,\r\nand quite as troublesome, but of a different species.\r\n\r\nThe temperature rose to 72 degrees, and the black-bulb thermometer to\r\n140 degrees. Magnolias and various almost tropical trees were common,\r\nand the herbaceous vegetation was that of low elevations.\r\nLarge sugar-cane (_Saccharum_), palm (_Wallichia_), and wild\r\nplantains grew near the river, and _Rhod. arboreum_ was very common\r\non dry slopes of mica-slate rocks, with the gorgeous and\r\nsweet-scented _Luculia gratissima._\r\n\r\nUp the valley of the Tawa the view was very grand of a magnificent\r\nrocky mountain called Sidingbah, bearing south-east by south, on a\r\nspur of the Singalelah range that runs westerly, and forms the south\r\nflank of the Tawa, and the north of the Khabili valleys.\r\nThis mountain is fully 12,000 feet high, crested with rock and ragged\r\nblack forest, which, on the north flank, extends to its base: to the\r\neastward, the bare ridges of Singalelah were patched with snow, below\r\nwhich they too were clothed with black pines.\r\n\r\nFrom the opposite side of the Tawa to Khabang (alt. 6,020 feet), I\r\nwas, during our march southwards, most fortunate in obtaining a\r\nsplendid view of Kinchinjunga (bearing north-east by north), with its\r\nassociates, rising over the dark mass of Singalelah, its flanks\r\nshowing like tier above tier of green glaciers: its distance was\r\nfully  twenty-five miles, and as only about 7000 feet or 8000 feet\r\nfrom its summit were visible, and Kubra was foreshortened against it,\r\nits appearance was not grand; added to which, its top was round and\r\nhummocky, not broken into peaks, as when seen from the south and\r\neast. Villages and cultivation became more frequent as we proceeded\r\nsouthward, and our daily marches were up ridges, and down into deep\r\nvalleys, with feeders from the flanks of Sidingbah to the Tambur.\r\nWe passed through the village of Tchonboong, and camped at Yangyading\r\n(4,100 feet), sighted Yamroop, a large village and military post to\r\nthe west of our route, crossed the Pangwa river, and reached the\r\nvalley of the Khabili. During this part of the journey, I did not\r\nonce see the Tambur river, though I was day after day marching only\r\nseven to ten miles distant from it, so uneven is the country.\r\nThe mountains around Taptiatok, Mywa Guola, and Chingtam, were\r\npointed out to me, but they presented no recognizable feature.\r\n\r\nI often looked for some slope, or strike of the slopes of the spurs,\r\nin any one valley, or that should prevail through several, but could\r\nseldom trace any, except on one or two occasions, at low elevations.\r\nLooking here across the valleys, there was a tendency in the gentle\r\nslopes of the spurs to have plane faces dipping north-east, and to be\r\nbounded by a line of cliffs striking north-west, and facing the\r\nsouth-east. In such arrangements, the upheaved cliffs may be supposed\r\nto represent parallel lines of faults, dislocation, or rupture, but I\r\ncould never trace any secondary valleys at right angles to these.\r\nThere is no such uniformity of strike as to give to the rivers a\r\nzig-zag course of any regularity, or one having any apparent\r\ndependence on a prevailing arrangement of the rocks; for, though the\r\nstrike of the chlorite and clay-slate at elevations below 6000 feet\r\nalong its course, is certainly north-west, with a dip to north-east,\r\nthe flexures of the river, as projected on the map, deviate very\r\nwidely from these directions.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Khabili is very grand, broad, open, and intersected\r\nby many streams and cultivated spurs: the road from Yamroop to\r\nSikkim, once well frequented, runs up its north flank, and though it\r\nwas long closed we determined to follow and clear it.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of December we camped near the village of Sablakoo (4,680\r\nfeet), and procured five days' food, to last us as far as the first\r\nSikkim village. Thence we proceeded eastward up the valley, but\r\ndescending to the Iwa, an affluent of the Khabili, through a tropical\r\nvegetation of _Pinus longifolia, Phyllanthus Emblica,_ dwarf\r\ndate-palm, etc.  Gneiss was here the prevailing rock, uniformly\r\ndipping north-east 20 degrees, and striking north-west. The same rock\r\nno doubt forms the mass Sidingbah, which reared its head 8000 feet\r\nabove the Iwa river, by whose bed we camped at 3,780 feet. Sand-flies\r\nabounded, and were most troublesome: troops of large monkeys were\r\nskipping about, and the whole scene was thoroughly tropical; still,\r\nthe thermometer fell to 38 degrees in the night, with heavy dew.\r\n\r\nThough we passed numerous villages, I found unusual difficulty in\r\ngetting provision, and received none of the presents so uniformly\r\nbrought by the villagers to a stranger. I was not long in\r\ndiscovering, to my great mortification, that these were appropriated\r\nby the Ghorkha Havildar, who seemed to have profited by our many days\r\nof short allowance, and diverted the current of hospitality from me\r\nto himself. His coolies I saw groaning under heavy burdens, when\r\nthose of my people were light; and the truth only came out when he\r\nhad the impudence to attempt to impose a part of his coolies' loads\r\non mine, to enable the former to  carry more food, whilst he was\r\npretending that he used every exertion to procure me a scanty supply\r\nof rice with my limited stock of money. I had treated this man and\r\nhis soldiers with the utmost kindness, even nursing them and clothing\r\nthem from my own stock of flannels, when sick and shivering amongst\r\nthe snows. Though a high caste Hindoo, and one who assumed Brahmin\r\nrank, he had, I found, no objection to eat forbidden things in\r\nsecret; and now that we were travelling amongst Hindoos, his caste\r\nobtained him everything, while money alone availed me. I took him\r\nroundly to task for his treachery, which caused him secretly to throw\r\naway a leg of mutton he had concealed; I also threatened to expose\r\nthe humbug of his pretension to caste, but it was then too late to\r\nprocure more food. Having hitherto much liked this man, and fully\r\ntrusted him, I was greatly pained by his conduct.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded east for three days, up the valley, through gloomy\r\nforests of tropical trees below 5000 feet; and ascended to oaks and\r\nmagnolias at 6000 feet. The path was soon obstructed, and we had to\r\ntear and cut our way, from 6000 to 10,000 feet, which took two days'\r\nvery hard work. Ticks swarmed in the small bamboo jungle, and my body\r\nwas covered with these loathsome insects, which got into my bed and\r\nhair, and even attached themselves to my eyelids during the night,\r\nwhen the constant annoyance and irritation completely banished sleep.\r\nIn the daytime they penetrated my trousers, piercing to my body in\r\nmany places, so that I repeatedly took off as many as twelve at one\r\ntime. It is indeed marvellous how so large an insect can painlessly\r\ninsert a stout barbed proboscis, which requires great force to\r\nextract it, and causes severe smarting in the operation. What the\r\nticks feed upon in these humid forests is a perfect mystery to me,\r\nfor from  6000 to 9000 feet they literally swarmed, where there was\r\nneither path nor animal life. They were, however, more tolerable than\r\na commoner species of parasite, which I found it impossible to escape\r\nfrom, all classes of mountaineers being infested with it.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, after an arduous ascent through the pathless jungle, we\r\ncamped at 9,300 feet on a narrow spur, in a dense forest, amongst\r\nimmense loose blocks of gneiss. The weather was foggy and rainy, and\r\nthe wind cold. I ate the last supply of animal food, a miserable\r\nstarved pullet, with rice and Chili vinegar; my tea, sugar, and all\r\nother superfluities having been long before exhausted.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, we crossed the Islumbo pass over Singalelah\r\ninto Sikkim, the elevation being 11,000 feet. Above our camp the\r\ntrees were few and stunted, and we quickly emerged from the forest on\r\na rocky and grassy ridge, covered with withered _Saxifrages,\r\nUmbelliferae, Parnassia, Hypericum,_ etc. There were no pines on\r\neither side of the pass; a very remarkable peculiarity of the damp\r\nmountains of Sikkim, which I have elsewhere had occasion to notice:\r\nwe had left _Pinus longifolia_ (a far from common tree in these\r\nvalleys) at 3000 feet in the Tawa three days before, and ascended to\r\n11,000 feet without passing a coniferous tree of any kind, except a\r\nfew yews, at 9000 feet, covered with red berries.\r\n\r\nThe top of the pass was broad, grassy, and bushy with dwarf Bamboo,\r\nRose, and Berberry, in great abundance, covered with mosses and\r\nlichens: it had been raining hard all the morning, and the vegetation\r\nwas coated with ice: a dense fog obscured everything, and a violent\r\nsouth-east wind blew over the pass in our teeth. I collected some\r\nvery curious and beautiful mosses, putting these frozen treasures\r\ninto my box, in the form of  exquisitely beautiful glass ornaments,\r\nor mosses frosted with silver.\r\n\r\nA few stones marked the boundary between Nepal and Sikkim, where I\r\nhalted for half an hour, and hung up my instruments: the temperature\r\nwas 32 degrees.\r\n\r\nWe descended rapidly, proceeding eastward down the broad valley of\r\nthe Kulhait river, an affluent of the Great Rungeet; and as it had\r\nbegun to sleet and snow hard, we continued until we reached 6,400\r\nfeet before camping.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we proceeded down the valley, and reached\r\nhabitations at 4000 feet: passing many villages and much cultivation,\r\nwe crossed the river, and ascended by 7 p.m., to the village of\r\nLingcham, just below the convent of Changachelling, very tired and\r\nhungry. Bad weather had set in, and it was pitch dark and raining\r\nhard when we arrived; but the Kajee, or head man, had sent out a\r\nparty with torches to conduct us, and he gave us a most hospitable\r\nreception, honoured us with a salute of musketry, and brought\r\nabundance of milk, eggs, fowls, plantains, and Murwa beer. Plenty of\r\nnews was awaiting me here, and a messenger with letters was three\r\nmarches further north, at Yoksun, waiting my expected return over the\r\nKanglanamo pass. Dr. Campbell, I was told, had left Dorjiling; and\r\nwas _en route_ to meet the Rajah at Bhomsong on the Teesta river,\r\nwhere no European had ever yet been; and as the Sikkim authorities\r\nhad for sixteen years steadily rejected every overture for a friendly\r\ninterview, and even refused to allow the agent of the\r\nGovernor-General to enter their dominions, it was evident that grave\r\ndoings were pending. I knew that Dr. Campbell had long used every\r\nexertion to bring the Sikkim Rajah to a friendly conference, without\r\nhaving to force his way into the country for the purpose, but in\r\nvain. It will hardly  be believed that though this chief's dominions\r\nwere redeemed by us from the Nepalese and given back to him; though\r\nwe had bound ourselves by a treaty to support him on his throne, and\r\nto defend him against the Nepalese on the west, the Bhutan people on\r\nthe east, and the Tibetans on the north; and though the terms of the\r\ntreaty stipulated for free intercourse, mutual protection, and\r\nfriendship; the Sikkim authorities had hitherto been allowed to\r\nobstruct all intercourse, and in every way to treat the\r\nGovernor-General's agent and the East India Company with contempt.\r\nAn affectation of timidity, mistrust, and ignorance was assumed for\r\nthe purpose of deception, and as a cloak for every insult and\r\nresistance to the terms of our treaty, and it was quoted by the\r\nGovernment in answer to every remonstrance on the part of their\r\nresident agent at Dorjiling.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the Kajee waited on me with a magnificent\r\npresent of a calf, a kid, fowls, eggs, rice, oranges, plantains,\r\negg-apples, Indian corn, yams, onions, tomatos, parsley, fennel,\r\nturmeric, rancid butter, milk, and, lastly, a coolie-load of\r\nfermenting millet-seeds, wherewith to make the favourite Murwa beer.\r\nIn the evening two lads arrived from Dorjiling, who had been sent a\r\nweek beforehand by my kind and thoughtful friend, Mr. Hodgson, with\r\nprovisions and money.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Kulhait is one o£ the finest in Sikkim, and it is\r\naccordingly the site of two of the oldest and richest conventual\r\nestablishments. Its length is sixteen miles, from the Islumbo pass to\r\nthe Great Rungeet, for ten of which it is inhabited, the villages\r\nbeing invariably on long meridional spurs that project north and\r\nsouth from either flank; they are about 2000 feet above the river,\r\nand from 4,500 to 5000 feet above the sea. Except where these spurs\r\nproject, the flanks of the valley are very steep, the mountains\r\nrising to 7000 or 8000 feet.\r\n\r\nLooking from any spur, up or down the valley, five or six others\r\nmight be seen on each side of the river, at very nearly the same\r\naverage level, all presenting great uniformity of contour, namely, a\r\ngentle slope towards the centre of the valley, and then an abrupt\r\ndescent to the river. They were about a quarter of a mile broad at\r\nthe widest, and often narrower, and a mile or so long; some parts of\r\ntheir surfaces and sides were quite flat, and occasionally occupied\r\nby marshes or ponds. Cultivation is almost confined to these spurs,\r\nand is carried on both on their summits and steep flanks; between\r\nevery two is a very steep gulley and water-course. The timber has\r\nlong since been either wholly or partially cleared from the tops,\r\nbut, to a great extent, still clothes their flanks and the\r\nintervening gorges. I have been particular in describing these spurs,\r\nbecause it is impossible to survey them without ascribing their\r\ncomparative uniformity of level to the action of water. Similar ones\r\nare characteristic features of the valleys of Sikkim between 2000 and\r\n8000 feet, and are rendered conspicuous by being always sites for\r\nvillages and cultivation: the soil is a vegetable mould, over a deep\r\nstratum of red clay.\r\n\r\nI am far from supposing that any geologically recent action of the\r\nsea has levelled these spurs; but as the great chain of the Himalaya\r\nhas risen from the ocean, and as every part of it has been subjected\r\nto sea-action, it is quite conceivable that intervals of rest during\r\nthe periods of elevation or submergence would effect their levelling.\r\nIn a mountain mass so tumbled as is that of Sikkim, any level\r\nsurface, or approach to it, demands study; and when, as in the\r\nKulhait valley, we find several similar spurs with comparatively flat\r\ntops, to occupy about the same level, it  is necessary to look for\r\nsome levelling cause. The action of denudation is still progressing\r\nwith astonishing rapidity, under an annual fall of from 100 to 150\r\ninches of rain; but its tendency is to obliterate all such phenomena,\r\nand to give sharp, rugged outlines to these spurs, in spite of the\r\nconservative effects of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe weather at Lingcham was gloomy, cold, and damp, with much rain\r\nand fog, and the mean temperature (45.25 degrees) was cold for the\r\nelevation (4,860 feet): 52.5 degrees was the highest temperature\r\nobserved, and 39 degrees the lowest.\r\n\r\nA letter from Dr. Campbell reached me three days after my arrival,\r\nbegging me to cross the country to the Teesta river, and meet him at\r\nBhomsong, on its west bank, where he was awaiting my arrival.\r\nI therefore left on the 20th of December, accompanied by my friend\r\nthe Kajee, who was going to pay his respects to the Rajah. He was\r\nconstantly followed by a lad, carrying a bamboo of Murwa beer slung\r\nround his neck, with which he kept himself always groggy. His dress\r\nwas thoroughly Lepcha, and highly picturesque, consisting of a very\r\nbroad-brimmed round-crowned bamboo-platted hat, scarlet jacket, and\r\nblue-striped cloth shirt, bare feet, long knife, bow and quiver,\r\nrings and earrings, and a long pigtail. He spoke no Hindoostanee, but\r\nwas very communicative through my interpreters.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Lingcham spur, we passed steep cliffs of mica and schist,\r\ncovered with brushwood and long grass, about 1000 feet above which\r\nthe Changachelling convent is perched. Crossing a torrent, we came to\r\nthe next village, on the spur of Kurziuk, where I was met by a\r\ndeputation of women, sent by the Lamas of Changachelling, bearing\r\nenormous loads of oranges, rice, milk, butter, ghee, and the\r\neverflowing Murwa beer.\r\n\r\nThe villagers had erected a shady bower for me to rest under, of\r\nleaves and branches, and had fitted up a little bamboo stage, on\r\nwhich to squat cross-legged as they do, or to hang my legs from, if I\r\npreferred: after conducting me to this, the parties advanced and\r\npiled their cumbrous presents on the ground, bowed, and retired; they\r\nwere succeeded by the beer-carrier, who plunged a clean drinking-tube\r\nto the bottom of the steaming bamboo jug (described in Chapter VII),\r\nand held it to my mouth, then placing it by my side, he bowed and\r\nwithdrew. Nothing can be more fascinating than the simple manners of\r\nthese kind people, who really love hospitality for its own sake, and\r\nmake the stranger feel himself welcome. Just now too, the Durbar had\r\nordered every attention to be paid me; and I hardly passed a village\r\nhowever small, without receiving a present, or a cottage, where beer\r\nwas not offered. This I found a most grateful beverage; and of the\r\noccasional rests under leafy screens during a hot day's march, and\r\nsips at the bamboo jug, I shall ever retain a grateful remembrance.\r\nHappily the liquor is very weak, and except by swilling, as my friend\r\nthe Kajee did, it would be impossible to get fuddled by it.\r\n\r\nAt Kurziuk I was met by a most respectable Lepcha, who, as a sort of\r\ncompliment, sent his son to escort us to the next village and spur of\r\nPemiongchi, to reach which we crossed another gorge, of which the\r\nsituation and features were quite similar to those of Kurziuk\r\nand Lingcham.\r\n\r\nThe Pemiongchi and Changachelling convents and temples stand a few\r\nmiles apart, on the ridge forming the north flank of the Kulhait\r\nvalley; and as they will be described hereafter, I now only allude to\r\nthe village, which is fully 1000 feet below the convent, and large\r\nand populous.\r\n\r\nAt Pemiongchi a superior Lama met me with another  overwhelming\r\npresent: he was a most jolly fat monk, shaven and girdled, and\r\ndressed in a scarlet gown: my Lepchas kotowed to him, and he blessed\r\nthem by the laying on of hands.\r\n\r\nIllustration--PEMIONGCHI GOOMPA AND CHAITS.\r\n\r\nThere is a marsh on this spur, full of the common English _Acorus\r\nCalamus,_ or sweet-flag, whose roots being very aromatic, are used in\r\ngriping disorders of men and cattle. Hence we descended suddenly to\r\nthe Great Rungeet, which we reached at its junction with the Kulhait:\r\nthe path was very steep and slippery, owing to micaceous rocks, and\r\nled along the side of an enormous Mendong,* [This remarkable\r\nstructure, called the Kaysing Mendong, is 200 yards long, 10 feet\r\nhigh, and 6 or 8 feet broad: it is built of flat, slaty stones, and\r\nboth faces are covered with inscribed slates, of which there are\r\nupwards of 700, and the inscriptions, chiefly \"Om Mani,\" etc., are in\r\nboth the Uchen and Lencha Ranja characters of Tibet. A tall stone,\r\nnine feet high, covered also with inscriptions, terminates it at the\r\nlower end.] which ran  down the hill for several hundred yards, and\r\nhad a large chait at each end, with several smaller ones at\r\nintervals. Throughout its length were innumerable inscriptions of \"Om\r\nMani Padmi om,\" with well carved figures of Boodh in his many\r\nincarnations, besides Lamas, etc. At the lower end was a great flat\r\narea, on which are burnt the bodies of Sikkim people of consequence:\r\nthe poorer people are buried, the richer burned, and their ashes\r\nscattered or interred, but not in graves proper, of which there are\r\nnone. Nor are there any signs of Lepcha interment throughout Sikkim;\r\nthough chaits are erected to the memory of the departed, they have no\r\nnecessary connection with the remains, and generally none at all.\r\nCorpses in Sikkim are never cut to pieces and thrown into lakes, or\r\nexposed on hills for the kites and crows to devour, as is the case\r\nin Tibet.\r\n\r\nWe passed some curious masses of crumpled chlorite slate, presenting\r\ndeep canals or furrows, along which a demon once drained all the\r\nwater from the Pemiongchi spur, to the great annoyance of the\r\nvillagers: the Lamas, however, on choosing this as a site for their\r\ntemples, easily confounded the machinations of the evil spirit, who,\r\nin the eyes of the simple Lepchas, was answerable for all\r\nthe mischief.\r\n\r\nI crossed the Great Rungeet at 1840 feet above the sea, where its bed\r\nwas twenty yards in width; a rude bridge, composed of two culms of\r\nbamboo and a handrail, conducted me to the other side, where we\r\ncamped (on the east bank) in a thick tropical jungle. In the evening\r\n I walked down the banks of the river, which flowed in a deep gorge,\r\ncumbered with enormous boulders of granite, clay-slate, and\r\nmica-slate; the rocks _in situ_ were all of the latter description,\r\nhighly inclined, and much dislocated. Some of the boulders were fully\r\nten feet in diameter, permeated and altered very much by granite\r\nveins which had evidently been injected when molten, and had taken up\r\nangular masses of the chlorite which remained, as it were, suspended\r\nin the veins.\r\n\r\nIt is not so easy to account for the present position of these blocks\r\nof granite, a rock not common at elevations below 10,000 feet.\r\nThey have been transported from a considerable distance in the\r\ninterior of the lofty valley to the north, and have descended not\r\nless than 8000 feet, and travelled fully fifteen miles in a straight\r\nline, or perhaps forty along the river bed. It may be supposed that\r\nmoraines have transported them to 8000 feet (the lowest limit of\r\napparent moraines), and the power of river water carried them\r\nfurther; if so, the rivers must have been of much greater volume\r\nformerly than they are now.\r\n\r\nOur camp was on a gravel flat, like those of the Nepal valleys, about\r\nsixty feet above the river; its temperature was 52 degrees, which\r\nfelt cool when bathing.\r\n\r\nFrom the river we proceeded west, following a steep and clayey ascent\r\nup the end of a very long spur, from the lofty mountain range called\r\nMungbreu, dividing the Great Rungeet from the Teesta. We ascended by\r\na narrow path, accomplishing 2,500 feet in an hour and a quarter,\r\nwalking slowly but steadily, without resting; this I always found a\r\nheavy pull in a hot climate.\r\n\r\nAt about 4000 feet above the sea, the spur became more open and flat,\r\nlike those of the Kulhait valley, with alternate slopes and\r\ncomparative flats: from this elevation the  view north, south, and\r\nwest, was very fine; below us flowed the river, and a few miles up it\r\nwas the conical wooded hill of Tassiding, rising abruptly from a fork\r\nof the deep river gorge, crowned with its curious temples and\r\nmendongs, and bristling with chaits: on it is the oldest monastery in\r\nSikkim, occupying a singularly picturesque and prominent position.\r\nNorth of this spur, and similar to it, lay that of Raklang, with the\r\ntemple and monastery of the same name, at about this elevation.\r\nIn front, looking west, across the Great Rungeet, were the\r\nmonasteries of Changachelling and Pemiongchi, perched aloft; and\r\nsouth of these were the flat-topped spurs of the Kulhait valley, with\r\ntheir villages, and the great mendong which I had passed on the\r\nprevious day, running like a white line down the spur. To the north,\r\nbeyond Tassiding, were two other monasteries, Doobdee and Sunnook,\r\nboth apparently placed on the lower wooded flanks of Kinchinjunga;\r\nwhilst close by was Dholing, the seventh religious establishment now\r\nin sight.\r\n\r\nWe halted at a good wooden house to refresh ourselves with Murwa\r\nbeer, where I saw a woman with cancer in the face, an uncommon\r\ncomplaint in this country. I here bought a little black puppy, to be\r\nmy future companion in Sikkim: he was of a breed between the famous\r\nTibet mastiff and the common Sikkim hunting-dog, which is a variety\r\nof the sorry race called Pariah in the plains. Being only a few weeks\r\nold, he looked a mere bundle of black fur; and I carried him off, for\r\nhe could not walk.\r\n\r\nWe camped at the village of Lingdam (alt. 5,550 feet), occupying a\r\nflat, and surrounded by extensive pools of water (for this country)\r\ncontaining _Acorus, Potamogeton,_ and duckweed. Such ponds I have\r\noften met with on these terraces, and they are very remarkable, not\r\nbeing dammed in by any conspicuous barrier, but simply occupying\r\ndepressions in the surface, from which, as I have repeatedly\r\nobserved, the land dips rapidly to the valleys below.\r\n\r\nThis being the high-road from Tumloong or Sikkim Durbar (the capital,\r\nand Rajah's residence) to the numerous monasteries which I had seen,\r\nwe passed many Lamas and monks on their way home from Tumloong, where\r\nthey had gone to be present at the marriage of the Tupgain Lama, the\r\neldest son of the Rajah. A dispensation having previously been\r\nprocured from Lhassa, this marriage had been effected by the Lamas,\r\nin order to counteract the efforts of the Dewan, who sought to\r\nexercise an undue influence over the Rajah and his family.\r\nThe Tupgain Lama having only spiritual authority, and being bound to\r\ncelibacy, the temporal authority devolved on the second son, who was\r\nheir apparent of Sikkim; he, however, having died, an illegitimate\r\nson of the Rajah was favoured by the Dewan as heir apparent.\r\nThe bride was brought from Tibet, and the marriage party were feasted\r\nfor eighteen days at the Rajah's expense. All the Lamas whom I met\r\nwere clad in red robes, with girdles, and were shaven, with bare feet\r\nand heads, or mitred; they wore rosaries of onyx, turquoise, quartz,\r\nlapis lazuli, coral, glass, amber, or wood, especially yellow\r\nberberry and sandal-wood: some had staves, and one a trident like an\r\neel-fork, on a long staff, an emblem of the Hindoo Trinity, called\r\nTrisool Mahadeo, which represents Brahma, Siva, and Vishnu, in\r\nHindoo; and Boodh, Dhurma, and Sunga, in Boodhist theology. All were\r\non foot, indeed ponies are seldom used in this country; the Lamas,\r\nhowever, walked with becoming gravity and indifference to all\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nThe Kajee waited upon me in the evening; full of importance, having\r\njust received a letter from his Rajah, which he wished to communicate\r\nto me in private; so I accompanied him to a house close by, where he\r\nwas a guest, when the  secret came out, that his highness was\r\ndreadfully alarmed at my coming with the two Ghorka Sepoys, whom I\r\naccordingly dismissed.\r\n\r\nThe house was of the usual Bhoteea form, of wood, well built on\r\nposts, one-storied, containing a single apartment hung round with\r\nbows, quivers, shields, baskets of rice, and cornucopias of Indian\r\ncorn, the handsomest and most generous looking of all the Cerealia.\r\nThe whole party were deep in a carouse on Murwa beer, and I saw the\r\noperation of making it. The millet-seed is moistened, and ferments\r\nfor two days: sufficient for a day's allowance is then put into a\r\nvessel of wicker-work, lined with India-rubber to make it\r\nwater-tight; and boiling water is poured on it with a ladle of gourd,\r\nfrom a huge iron cauldron that stands all day over the fire.\r\nThe fluid, when quite fresh, tastes like negus of Cape sherry, rather\r\nsour. At this season the whole population are swilling, whether at\r\nhome or travelling, and heaps of the red-brown husks are seen by the\r\nside of all the paths.\r\n\r\nIllustration--SIKKIM LAMAS WITH PRAYING CYLINDER AND DORJE; THE\r\nLATERAL FIGURES ARE MONKS OR GYLONGS.\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nRaklang pass -- Uses of nettles -- Edible plants -- Lepcha war --\r\nDo-mani stone -- Neongong -- Teesta valley -- Pony, saddle, etc. --\r\nMeet Campbell -- Vegetation and scenery -- Presents -- Visit of Dewan\r\n-- Characters of Rajah and Dewan -- Accounts of Tibet -- Lhassa --\r\nSiling -- Tricks of Dewan -- Walk up Teesta -- Audience of Rajah --\r\nLamas -- Kajees -- Tchebu Lama, his character and position -- Effects\r\nof interview -- Heir-apparent -- Dewan's house -- Guitar -- Weather\r\n-- Fall of river -- Tibet officers -- Gigantic trees -- Neongong lake\r\n-- Mainom, ascent of -- Vegetation -- Camp on snow -- Silver fire --\r\nView from top -- Kinchin, etc. -- Geology -- Vapours -- Sunset effect\r\n-- Elevation -- Temperature, etc. -- Lamas of Neongong -- Temples --\r\nReligious festival -- Bamboo, flowering -- Recross pass of Raklang --\r\nNumerous temples, villages, etc. -- Domestic animals -- Descent to\r\nGreat Rungeet.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, after receiving the usual presents from the\r\nLamas of Dholing, and from a large posse of women belonging to the\r\nvillage of Barphiung, close by, we ascended the Raklang pass, which\r\ncrosses the range dividing the waters of the Teesta from those of the\r\nGreat Rungeet. The Kajee still kept beside me, and proved a lively\r\ncompanion: seeing me continually plucking and noting plants, he gave\r\nme much local information about them. He told me the uses made of the\r\nfibres of the various nettles; some being twisted for bowstrings,\r\nothers as a thread for sewing and weaving; while many are eaten raw\r\nand in soups, especially the numerous little succulent species.\r\nThe great yellow-flowered _Begonia_ was abundant, and he cut its\r\njuicy stalks to make sauce (as we do apple-sauce) for some pork which\r\nhe expected to get at Bhomsong; the taste is acid and very pleasant.\r\nThe large succulent fern, called _Botrychium,_* [_Botrychium\r\nVirginicum,_ Linn. This fern is eaten abundantly by the New\r\nZealanders: its distribution is most remarkable, being found very\r\nrarely indeed in Europe, and in Norway only. It abounds in many parts\r\nof the Southern United States, the Andes of Mexico, etc., in the\r\nHimalaya mountains, Australia, and New Zealand.] grew here\r\nplentifully; it is boiled and eaten, both here and in New Zealand.\r\nFerns are more commonly used for food than is supposed. In Calcutta\r\nthe Hindoos boil young tops of a _Polypodium_ with their shrimp\r\ncurries; and both in Sikkim and Nepal the watery tubers of an\r\n_Aspidium_ are abundantly eaten. So also the pulp of one tree-fern\r\naffords food, but only in times of scarcity, as does that of another\r\nspecies in New Zealand (_Cyathea medullaris_): the pith of all is\r\ncomposed of a coarse sago, that is to say, of cellular tissue with\r\nstarch granules.\r\n\r\nA thick forest of Dorjiling vegetation covers the summit, which is\r\nonly 6,800 feet above the sea: it is a saddle, connecting the lofty\r\nmountain of Mainom (alt. 11,000 feet) to the north, with Tendong\r\n(alt. 8,663 feet) to the south. Both these mountains are on a range\r\nwhich is continuous with Kinchinjunga, projecting from it down into\r\nthe very heart of Sikkim. A considerable stand was made here by the\r\nLepchas during the Nepal war in 1787; they defended the pass with\r\ntheir arrows for some hours, and then retired towards the Teesta,\r\nmaking a second stand lower down, at a place pointed out to me, where\r\nrocks on either side gave them the same advantages. The Nepalese,\r\nhowever, advanced to the Teesta, and then retired with little loss.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately a thick mist and heavy rain cut off all view of the\r\nTeesta valley, and the mountains of Chola to the eastward; which I\r\nmuch regretted.\r\n\r\nDescending by a very steep, slippery path, we came to a fine mass of\r\nslaty gneiss, thirty feet long and thirteen feet high; not _in situ,_\r\nbut lying on the mountain side: on its sloping face was carved in\r\nenormous characters, \"Om Mani Padmi om\"; of which letters the\r\ntop-strokes afford an uncertain footing to the enthusiast who is\r\nwilling to purchase a good metempsychosis by walking along the slope,\r\nwith his heels or toes in their cavities. A small inscription in one\r\ncorner is said to imply that this was the work of a pious monk of\r\nRaklang; and the stone is called \"Do-mani,\" literally, \"stone of\r\nprayer.\"\r\n\r\nIllustration--DO-MANI STONE.\r\n\r\nThe rocks and peaks of Mainom are said to overhang the descent here\r\nwith grandeur; but the continued rain hid everything but a curious\r\nshivered peak, apparently of chlorite schist, which was close by, and\r\nreflected a green colour it is of course reported to be of turquoise,\r\nand inaccessible. Descending, the rocks became more micaceous, with\r\nbroad seams of pipe-clay, originating in decomposed beds of\r\nfelspathic gneiss: the natives used this to whitewash and mortar\r\ntheir temples.\r\n\r\nI passed the monastery of Neongong, the monks of which were building\r\na new temple; and came to bring me a large present. Below it is a\r\npretty little lake, about 100 yards across, fringed with brushwood.\r\nWe camped at the village of Nampok, 4,370 feet above the sea; all\r\nthoroughly sodden with rain.\r\n\r\nDuring the night much snow had fallen at and above 9000 feet, but the\r\nweather cleared on the following morning, and disclosed the top of\r\nMainom, rising close above my camp, in a series of rugged shivered\r\npeaks, crested with pines, which looked like statues of snow: to all\r\nother quarters this mountain presents a very gently sloping outline.\r\nUp the Teesta valley there was a pretty peep of snowy mountains,\r\nbearing north 35 degrees east, of no great height.\r\n\r\nI was met by a messenger from Dr. Campbell who told me he was waiting\r\nbreakfast; so I left my party, and, accompanied by the Kajee and\r\nMeepo, hurried down to the valley of the Rungoon (which flows east to\r\nthe Teesta), through a fine forest of tropical trees; passing the\r\nvillages of Broom* [On the top of the ridge above Broom, a tall stone\r\nis erected by the side of the path, covered with private marks,\r\nindicating the height of various individuals who are accustomed to\r\nmeasure themselves thus; there was but one mark above 5 feet 7\r\ninches, and that was 6 inches higher. It turned out to be Campbell's,\r\nwho had passed a few days before, and was thus proved to top the\r\nnatives of Sikkim by a long way.] and Lingo, to the spur of that\r\nname; where I was met by a servant of the Sikkim Dewan's, with a pony\r\nfor my use. I stared at the animal, and felt inclined to ask what he\r\nhad to do here, where it was difficult enough to walk up and down\r\nslippery slopes, amongst boulders of rock, heavy forest, and foaming\r\ntorrents; but I was little aware of what these beasts could\r\naccomplish. The Tartar saddle was imported from Tibet, and certainly\r\na curiosity; once--but a long time ago--it must have been very\r\nhandsome; it was high-peaked, covered with shagreen and silvered\r\nornaments, wretchedly girthed, and with great stirrups attached to\r\nshort leathers. The bridle and head-gear were much too complicated\r\nfor description; there were good leather, raw hide, hair-rope, and\r\nscarlet worsted all brought into use; the bit was the ordinary\r\nAsiatic one, jointed, and with two rings. I mounted on one side, and\r\nat once rolled over, saddle and all, to the other; the pony standing\r\nquite still. I preferred walking; but Dr. Campbell had begged of me\r\nto use the pony, as the Dewan had procured and sent it at great\r\ntrouble: I, however, had it led till I was close to Bhomsong, when I\r\nwas hoisted into the saddle and balanced on it, with my toes in the\r\nstirrups and my knees up to my breast; twice, on the steep descent to\r\nthe river, my saddle and I were thrown on the pony's neck; in these\r\nawkward emergencies I was assisted by a man on each side, who\r\nsupported my weight on my elbows: they seemed well accustomed to\r\neasing mounted ponies down hill without giving the rider the trouble\r\nof dismounting. Thus I entered Dr. Campbell's camp at Bhomsong, to\r\nthe pride and delight of my attendants; and received a hearty welcome\r\nfrom my old friend, who covered me with congratulations on the\r\nsuccessful issue of a journey which, at this season, and under such\r\ndifficulties and discouragements, he had hardly thought feasible.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell's tent was pitched in an orange-grove, occupying a flat\r\non the west bank of the Teesta, close to a small enclosure of\r\npine-apples, with a pomegranate tree in the middle. The valley is\r\nvery narrow, and the vegetation wholly tropical, consisting of two\r\nspecies of oak, several palms, rattan-cane (screw-pine), _Pandanus,_\r\ntall grasses, and all the natives of dense hot jungles. The river is\r\na grand feature, broad, rocky, deep, swift, and broken by enormous\r\nboulders of rock; its waters were of a pale opal green, probably from\r\nthe materials of the soft micaceous rocks through which it flows.\r\n\r\nA cane bridge crosses it,* [Whence the name of Bhomsong Samdong, the\r\nlatter word meaning bridge.] but had been cut away (in feigned\r\ndistrust of us), and the long canes were streaming from their\r\nattachments on either shore down the stream, and a triangular raft\r\nof bamboo was plying instead, drawn to and fro by means of a\r\nstrong cane.\r\n\r\nSoon after arriving I received a present from the Rajah, consisting\r\nof a brick of Tibet tea, eighty pounds of rancid yak butter, in large\r\nsquares, done up in yak-hair cloth, three loads of rice, and one of\r\nMurwa for beer; rolls of bread,* [These rolls, or rather, sticks of\r\nbread, are made in Tibet, of fine wheaten flour, and keep for a long\r\ntime: they are sweet and good, but very dirtily prepared.] fowls,\r\neggs, dried plums, apricots, jujubes, currants, and Sultana raisins,\r\nthe latter fruits purchased at Lhassa, but imported thither from\r\nwestern Tibet; also some trays of coarse milk-white crystallised\r\nsalt, as dug in Tibet.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we were visited by the Dewan, the head and front of\r\nall our Sikkim difficulties, whose influence was paramount with the\r\nRajah, owing to the age and infirmities of the latter, and his\r\ndevotion to religion, which absorbed all his time and thoughts.\r\nThe Dewan was a good-looking Tibetan, very robust, fair, muscular and\r\nwell fleshed; he had a very broad Tartar face, quite free of hair; a\r\nsmall and beautifully formed mouth and chin, very broad cheekbones,\r\nand a low, contracted forehead: his manners were courteous and\r\npolite, but evidently affected, in assumption of better breeding than\r\nhe could in reality lay claim to. The Rajah himself was a Tibetan of\r\njust respectable extraction, a native of the Sokpo province, north of\r\nLhassa: his Dewan was related to one of his wives, and I believe a\r\nLhassan by birth as well as extraction, having probably also Kashmir\r\nblood in him.* [The Tibetans court promiscuous intercourse between\r\ntheir families and the Kashmir merchants who traverse their country.]\r\nThough minister, he was neither financier nor politician, but a mere\r\nplunderer of Sikkim, introducing his relations, and those whom he\r\ncalls so, into the best estates in the country, and trading in great\r\nand small wares, from a Tibet pony to a tobacco pipe, wholesale and\r\nretail. Neither he nor the Rajah are considered worthy of notice by\r\nthe best Tibet families or priests, or by the Chinese commissioners\r\nsettled in Lhassa and Jigatzi. The latter regard Sikkim as virtually\r\nEnglish, and are contented with knowing that its ruler has no army,\r\nand with believing that its protectors, the English, could not march\r\nan army across the Himalaya if they would.\r\n\r\nThe Dewan, trading in wares which we could supply better and cheaper,\r\nnaturally regarded us with repugnance, and did everything in his\r\npower to thwart Dr. Campbell's attempts to open a friendly\r\ncommunication between the Sikkim and English governments. The Rajah\r\nowed everything to us, and was, I believe, really grateful; but he\r\nwas a mere cipher in the hands of his minister. The priests again,\r\nwhile rejoicing in our proximity, were apathetic, and dreaded the\r\nmore active Dewan; and the people had long given evidence of their\r\nconfidence in the English. Under these circumstances it was in the\r\nhope of gaining the Rajah's own ear, and representing to him the\r\nadvantages of promoting an intercourse with us, and the danger of\r\ncontinuing to violate the terms of our treaty, that Dr. Campbell had\r\nbeen authorised by government to seek an interview with His Highness.\r\nAt present our relations were singularly infelicitous. There was no\r\nagent on the Sikkim Rajah's part to conduct business at Dorjiling,\r\nand the Dewan insisted on sending a creature of his own, who had\r\nbefore been dismissed for insolence. Malefactors who escaped into\r\nSikkim were protected, and our police interrupted in the discharge of\r\ntheir duties; slavery was practised; and government communications\r\nwere detained for weeks and months under false pretences.\r\n\r\nIn his interviews with us the Dewan appeared to advantage: he was\r\nfond of horses and shooting, and prided himself on his hospitality.\r\nWe gained much information from many conversations with him, during\r\nwhich politics were never touched upon. Our queries naturally\r\nreferred to Tibet and its geography, especially its great feature the\r\nYarou Tsampoo river; this he assured us was the Burrampooter of\r\nAssam, and that no one doubted it in that country. Lhassa he\r\ndescribed as a city in the bottom of a flat-floored valley,\r\nsurrounded by lofty snowy mountains: neither grapes, tea, silk, or\r\ncotton are produced near it, but in the Tartchi province of Tibet,\r\none month's journey east of Lhassa, rice, and a coarse kind of tea\r\nare both grown. Two months' journey north-east of Lhassa is Siling,\r\nthe well-known great commercial entrepot* [The entrepot is now\r\nremoved to Tang-Keou-Eul.--See Huc and Gabet.] in west China; and\r\nthere coarse silk is produced. All Tibet he described as mountainous,\r\nand an inconceivably poor country: there are no plains, save flats in\r\nthe bottoms of the valleys, and the paths lead over lofty mountains.\r\nSometimes, when the inhabitants are obliged from famine to change\r\ntheir habitations in winter, the old and feeble are frozen to death,\r\nstanding and resting their chins on their staves; remaining as\r\npillars of ice, to fall only when the thaw of the ensuing\r\nspring commences.\r\n\r\nWe remained several days at Bhomsong, awaiting an interview with the\r\nRajah, whose movements the Dewan kept shrouded in mystery. On Dr.\r\nCampbell's arrival at this river a week before, he found messengers\r\nwaiting to inform him that the Rajah would meet him here; this being\r\nhalf way between Dorjiling and Tumloong. Thenceforward every\r\nsubterfuge was resorted to by the Dewan to frustrate the meeting; and\r\neven after the arrival of the Rajah on the east bank, the Dewan\r\ncommunicated with Dr. Campbell by shooting across the river arrows to\r\nwhich were attached letters, containing every possible argument to\r\ninduce him to return to Dorjiling; such as that the Rajah was sick at\r\nTumloong, that he was gone to Tibet, that he had a religious fast and\r\nrites to perform, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nOne day we walked up the Teesta to the Rumphiup river, a torrent from\r\nMainom mountain to the west; the path led amongst thick jungle of\r\n_Wallichia_ palm, prickly rattan canes, and the _Pandanus,_ or\r\nscrew-pine, called \"Borr,\" which has a straight, often forked,\r\npalm-like trunk, and an immense crown of grassy saw-edged leaves four\r\nfeet long: it bears clusters of uneatable fruit as large as a man's\r\nfist, and their similarity to the pine-apple has suggested the name\r\nof \"Borr\" for the latter fruit also, which has for many years been\r\ncultivated in Sikkim, and yields indifferent produce. Beautiful pink\r\nbalsams covered the ground, but at this season few other showy plants\r\nwere in flower: the rocks were chlorite, very soft and silvery, and\r\nso curiously crumpled and contorted as to appear as though formed of\r\nscaled of mica crushed together, and confusedly arranged in layers:\r\nthe strike was north-west, and dip north-east from 60 degrees to\r\n70 degrees.\r\n\r\nMessengers from the Dewan overtook us at the river to announce that\r\nthe Rajah was prepared and waiting to give us a reception; so we\r\nreturned, and I borrowed a coat from Dr. Campbell instead of my\r\ntattered shooting-jacket; and we crossed the river on the\r\nbamboo-raft. As it is the custom on these occasions to exchange\r\npresents, I was officially supplied with some red cloth and beads:\r\nthese, as well as Dr. Campbell's present, should only have been\r\ndelivered during or after the audience; but our wily friend the Dewan\r\nhere played us a very shabby trick; for he managed that our presents\r\nshould be stealthily brought in before our appearance, thus giving to\r\nthe by-standers the impression of our being tributaries to\r\nhis Highness!\r\n\r\nThe audience chamber was a mere roofed shed of neat bamboo wattle,\r\nabout twenty feet long: two Bhoteeas in scarlet. jackets, and with\r\nbows in their hands, stood on each side of the door, and our own\r\nchairs were carried before us for our accommodation. Within was a\r\nsquare wicker throne, six feet high, covered with purple silk,\r\nbrocaded with dragons in white and gold, and overhung by a canopy of\r\ntattered blue silk, with which material part of the walls also was\r\ncovered. An oblong box (containing papers) with gilded dragons on it,\r\nwas placed on the stage or throne, and behind it was perched\r\ncross-legged, an odd, black, insignificant looking old man, with\r\ntwinkling upturned eyes: he was swathed in yellow silk, and wore on\r\nhis head a pink silk hat with a flat broad crown, from all sides of\r\nwhich hung floss silk. This was the Rajah, a genuine Tibetan, about\r\nseventy years old. On some steps close by, and ranged down the\r\napartment, were his relations, all in brocaded silk robes reaching\r\nfrom the throat to the ground, and girded about the waist; and\r\nwearing caps similar to that of the Rajah. Kajees, counsellors, and\r\nshaven mitred Lamas were there, to the number of twenty, all planted\r\nwith their backs to the wall, mute and motionless as statues. A few\r\nspectators were huddled together at the lower end of the room, and a\r\nmonk waved about an incense pot containing burning juniper and other\r\nodoriferous plants. Altogether the scene was solemn and impressive:\r\nas Campbell well expressed it, the genius of Lamaism reigned supreme.\r\n\r\nWe saluted, but received no complimentary return; our chairs were\r\nthen placed, and we seated ourselves, when the Dewan came in, clad in\r\na superb purple silk robe, worked with circular gold figures, and\r\nformally presented us. The Dewan then stood; and as the Rajah did not\r\nunderstand Hindoostanee, our conversation was carried on through the\r\nmedium of a little bare-headed rosy-cheeked Lama, named \"Tchebu,\"\r\nclad in a scarlet gown, who acted as interpreter. The conversation\r\nwas short and constrained: Tchebu was known as a devoted servant of\r\nthe Rajah and of the heir apparent; and in common with all the Lamas\r\nhe hates the Dewan, and desires a friendly intercourse between Sikkim\r\nand Dorjiling. He is, further, the only servant of the Rajah capable\r\nof conversing both in Hindoo and Tibetan, and the uneasy distrustful\r\nlook of the Dewan, who understands the latter language only, was very\r\nevident. He was as anxious to hurry over the interview, as Dr.\r\nCampbell and Tchebu were to protract it; it was clear, therefore,\r\nthat nothing satisfactory could be done under such auspices.\r\n\r\nAs a signal for departure white silk scarfs were thrown over our\r\nshoulders, according to the established custom in Tibet, Sikkim, and\r\nBhotan; and presents were made to us of China silks, bricks of tea,\r\nwoollen cloths, yaks, ponies, and salt, with worked silk purses and\r\nfans for Mrs. Campbell; after which we left. The whole scene was\r\nnovel and very curious. We had had no previous idea of the extreme\r\npoverty of the Rajah, of his utter ignorance of the usages of\r\nOriental life, and of his not having anyone near to instruct him.\r\nThe neglect of our salutation, and the conversion of our presents\r\ninto tribute, did not arise from any ill-will: it was owing to the\r\ncraft of the Dewan in taking advantage of the Rajah's ignorance of\r\nhis own position and of good manners. Miserably poor, without any\r\nretinue, taking no interest in what passes in his own kingdom,\r\nsubsisting on the plainest and coarsest food, passing his time in\r\neffectually abstracting his mind from the consideration of earthly\r\nthings, and wrapt in contemplation, the Sikkim Rajah has arrived at\r\ngreat sanctity, and is all but prepared for that absorption into the\r\nessence of Boodh, which is the end and aim of all good Boodhists.\r\nThe mute conduct of his Court, who looked like attendants at an\r\ninquisition, and the profound veneration expressed in every word and\r\ngesture of those who did move and speak, recalled a Pekin reception.\r\nHis attendants treated him as a being of a very different nature from\r\nthemselves; and well might they do so, since they believe that he\r\nwill never die, but retire from the world only to re-appear under\r\nsome equally sainted form.\r\n\r\nThough productive of no immediate good, our interview had a very\r\nfavourable effect on the Lamas and people, who had long wished it;\r\nand the congratulations we received thereon during the remainder of\r\nour stay in Sikkim were many and sincere. The Lamas we found\r\nuniversally in high spirits; they having just effected the marriage\r\nof the heir apparent, himself a Lama, said to possess much ability\r\nand prudence, and hence being very obnoxious to the Dewan, who\r\nvehemently opposed the marriage. As, however, the minister had\r\nestablished his influence over the youngest, and estranged the Rajah\r\nfrom his eldest son, and was moreover in a fair way for ruling Sikkim\r\nhimself, the Church rose in a body, procured a dispensation from\r\nLhassa for the marriage of a priest, and thus hoped to undermine the\r\ninfluence of the violent and greedy stranger.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, we paid a farewell visit to the Dewan, whom we found\r\nin a bamboo wicker-work hut, neatly hung with bows, arrows, and round\r\nLepcha shields of cane, each with a scarlet tuft of yak-hair in the\r\nmiddle; there were also muskets, Tibetan arms, and much horse gear;\r\nand at one end was a little altar, with cups, bells, pastiles, and\r\nimages. He was robed in a fawn-coloured silk gown, lined with the\r\nsoftest of wool, that taken from unborn lambs: like most Tibetans, he\r\nextracts all his beard with tweezers; an operation he civilly\r\nrecommended to me, accompanying the advice with the present of a neat\r\npair of steel forceps. He aspires to be considered a man of taste,\r\nand plays the Tibetan guitar, on which he performed some airs for our\r\namusement: the instrument is round-bodied and long-armed, with six\r\nstrings placed in pairs, and probably comes from Kashmir: the Tibetan\r\nairs were simple and quite pretty, with the time well marked.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Bhomsong, the weather was cool, considering the\r\nlow elevation (1,500 feet), and very steady; the mean temperature was\r\n52.25 degrees, the maximum 71.25 degrees, the minimum 42.75 degrees.\r\nThe sun set behind the lofty mountains at 3 p.m., and in the morning\r\na thick, wet, white, dripping fog settled in the bottom of the\r\nvalley, and extended to 800 or 1000 feet above the river-bed; this\r\nwas probably caused by the descent of cold currents into the humid\r\ngorge: it was dissipated soon after sunrise, but formed again at\r\nsunset for a few minutes, giving place to clear starlight nights.\r\n\r\nA thermometer sunk two feet seven inches, stood at 64 degrees.\r\nThe temperature of the water was pretty constant at 51 degrees: from\r\nhere to the plains of India the river has a nearly uniform fall of\r\n1000 feet in sixty-nine miles, or sixteen feet to a mile: were its\r\ncourse straight for the same distance, the fall would be 1000 feet in\r\nforty miles, or twenty-five feet to a mile.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell's object being accomplished, he was anxious to make the\r\nbest use of the few days that remained before his return to\r\nDorjiling, and we therefore arranged to ascend Mainom, and visit the\r\nprincipal convents in Sikkim together, after which he was to return\r\nsouth, whilst I should proceed north to explore the south flank of\r\nKinchinjunga. For the first day our route was that by which I had\r\narrived. We left on Christmas-day, accompanied by two of the Rajah's,\r\nor rather Dewan's officers, of the ranks of Dingpun and Soupun,\r\nanswering to those of captain and lieutenant; the titles were,\r\nhowever, nominal, the Rajah having no soldiers, and these men being\r\nprofoundly ignorant of the mysteries of war or drill. They were\r\nsplendid specimens of Sikkim Bhoteeas (i.e. Tibetans, born in Sikkim,\r\nsometimes called Arrhats), tall, powerful, and well built, but\r\ninsolent and bullying: the Dingpun wore the Lepcha knife, ornamented\r\nwith turquoises, together with Chinese chopsticks. Near Bhomsong,\r\nCampbell pointed out a hot bath to me, which he had seen employed: it\r\nconsisted of a hollowed prostrate tree trunk, the water in which was\r\nheated by throwing in hot stones with bamboo tongs. The temperature\r\nis thus raised to 114 degrees, to which the patient submits at\r\nrepeated intervals for several days, never leaving till wholly\r\nexhausted. These baths are called \"Sa-choo,\" literally \"hot-water,\"\r\nin Tibetan.\r\n\r\nWe stopped to measure some splendid trees in the valley, and found\r\nthe trunk of one to be forty-five feet round the buttresses, and\r\nthirty feet above them, a large size for the Himalaya: they were a\r\nspecies of _Terminalia (Pentaptera),_ and called by the Lepchas\r\n\"Sillok-Kun,\" \"Kun\" meaning tree.\r\n\r\nWe slept at Nampok, and the following morning commenced the ascent.\r\nOn the way we passed the temple and lake of Neongong; the latter is\r\nabout 400 yards round, and has no outlet. It contained two English\r\nplants, the common duckweed (_Lemna minor_), and _Potamogeton\r\nnatans_: some coots were swimming in it, and having flushed a\r\nwoodcock, I sent for my gun, but the Lamas implored us not to shoot,\r\nit being contrary to their creed to take life wantonly.\r\n\r\nWe left a great part of our baggage at Neongong, as we intended to\r\nreturn there; and took up with us bedding, food, etc., for two days.\r\nA path hence up the mountain is frequented once a year by the Lamas,\r\nwho make a pilgrimage to the top for worship. The ascent was very\r\ngradual for 4000 feet. We met with snow at the level of Dorjiling\r\n(7000 feet), indicating a colder climate than at that station, where\r\nnone had fallen; the vegetation was, however, similar, but not so\r\nrich, and at 8000 feet trees common also to the top of Sinchul\r\nappeared, with _R. Hodgsoni,_ and the beautiful little\r\nwinter-flowering primrose, _P. petiolaris,_ whose stemless flowers\r\nspread like broad purple stars on the deep green foliage. Above, the\r\npath runs along the ridge of the precipices facing the south-east,\r\nand here we caught a glimpse of the great valley of the Ryott, beyond\r\nthe Teesta, with Tumloong, the Rajah's residence, on its north flank,\r\nand the superb snowy peak of Chola at its head.\r\n\r\nOne of our coolies, loaded with crockery and various indispensables,\r\nhad here a severe fall, and was much bruised; he however recovered\r\nhimself, but not our goods.\r\n\r\nThe rocks were all of chlorite slate, which is not usual at this\r\nelevation; the strike was north-west, and dip north-east. At 9000\r\nfeet various shrubby rhododendrons prevailed, with mountain-ash,\r\nbirch, and dwarf-bamboo; also _R. Falconeri,_ which grew from forty\r\nto fifty feet high. The snow was deep and troublesome, so we encamped\r\nat 9,800 feet, or 800 feet below the top, in a wood of _Pyrus,\r\nMagnolia, Rhododendron,_ and bamboo. As the ground was deeply covered\r\nwith snow, we laid our beds on a thick layer of rhododendron twigs,\r\nbamboo, and masses of a pendent moss.\r\n\r\nWe passed a very cold night, chiefly owing to damp, the temperature\r\nfalling to 24 degrees. On the following morning we scrambled through\r\nthe snow, reaching the summit after an hour's very laborious ascent,\r\nand took up our quarters in a large wooden barn-like temple\r\n(_goompa_), built on a stone platform. The summit was very broad, but\r\nthe depth of the snow prevented our exploring much, and the silver\r\nfirs (_Abies Webbiana_) were so tall, that no view could be obtained,\r\nexcept from the temple. The great peak of Kinchinjunga is in part\r\nhidden by those of Pundim and Nursing, but the panorama of snowy\r\nmountains is very grand indeed. The effect is quite deceptive; the\r\nmountains assuming the appearance of a continued chain, the distant\r\nsnowy peaks being seemingly at little further distance than the\r\nnearer ones. The whole range (about twenty-two miles nearer than at\r\nDorjiling) appeared to rise uniformly and steeply out of black pine\r\nforests, which were succeeded by the russet-brown of the rhododendron\r\nshrubs, and that again by tremendous precipices and gulleys, into\r\nwhich descended mighty glaciers and perpetual snows. This excessive\r\nsteepness is however only apparent, being due to foreshortening.\r\n\r\nThe upper 10,000 feet of Kinchin, and the tops of Pundim, Kubra, and\r\nJunnoo, are evidently of granite, and are rounded in outline: the\r\nlower peaks again, as those of Nursing, etc., present rugged\r\npinnacles of black and red stratified rocks, in many cases resting on\r\nwhite granite, to which they present a remarkable contrast. The\r\ngeneral appearance was as if Kinchin and the whole mass of mountains\r\nclustered around it, had been up-heaved by white granite, which still\r\nforms the loftiest summits, and has raised the black stratified rocks\r\nin some places to 20,000 feet in numerous peaks and ridges. One range\r\npresented on every summit a cap of black stratified rocks of uniform\r\ninclination and dip, striking north-west, with precipitous faces to\r\nthe south-west: this was clear to the naked eye, and more evident\r\nwith the telescope, the range in question being only fifteen miles\r\ndistant, running between Pundim and Nursing. The fact of the granite\r\nforming the greatest elevation must not be hastily attributed to that\r\nigneous rock having burst through the stratified, and been protruded\r\nbeyond the latter: it is much more probable that the upheaval of the\r\ngranite took place at a vast depth, and beneath an enormous pressure\r\nof stratified rocks and perhaps of the ocean; since which period the\r\nelevation of the whole mountain chain, and the denudation of the\r\nstratified rocks, has been slowly proceeding.\r\n\r\nTo what extent denudation has thus lowered the peaks we dare scarcely\r\nform a conjecture; but considering the number and variety of the beds\r\nwhich in some places overlie the gneiss and granite, we may\r\nreasonably conclude that many thousand feet have been removed.\r\n\r\nIt is further assumable that the stratified rocks originally took the\r\nforms of great domes, or arches. The prevailing north-west strike\r\nthroughout the Himalaya vaguely indicates a general primary\r\narrangement of the curves into waves, whose crests run north-west and\r\nsouth-cast; an arrangement which no minor or posterior forces have\r\nwholly disturbed, though they have produced endless dislocations, and\r\nespecially a want of uniformity in the amount and direction of the\r\ndip. Whether the loftiest waves were the result of one great\r\nconvulsion, or of a long-continued succession of small ones, the\r\neffect would be the same, namely, that the strata over those points\r\nat which the granite penetrated the highest, would be the most\r\ndislocated, and the most exposed to wear during denudation.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed the view of this superb scenery till noon, when the clouds\r\nwhich had obscured Dorjiling since morning were borne towards us by\r\nthe southerly wind, rapidly closing in the landscape on all sides.\r\nAt sunset they again broke, retreating from the northward, and rising\r\nfrom Sinchul and Dorjiling last of all, whilst a line of vapour,\r\nthrown by perspective into one narrow band, seemed to belt the\r\nSingalelah range with a white girdle, darkened to black where it\r\ncrossed the snowy mountains; and it was difficult to believe that\r\nthis belt did not really hang upon the ranges from twenty to thirty\r\nmiles off, against which it was projected; or that its true position\r\nwas comparatively close to the mountain on which we were standing,\r\nand was due to condensation around its cool, broad, flat summit.\r\n\r\nAs usual from such elevations, sunset produced many beautiful\r\neffects. The zenith was a deep blue, darkening opposite the setting\r\nsun, and paling over it into a peach colour, and that again near the\r\nhorizon passing into a glowing orange-red, crossed by coppery streaks\r\nof cirrhus. Broad beams of pale light shot from the sun to the\r\nmeridian, crossing the moon and the planet Venus. Far south, through\r\ngaps in the mountains, the position of the plains of India, 10,000\r\nfeet below us, was indicated by a deep leaden haze, fading upwards in\r\ngradually paler bands (of which I counted fifteen) to the clear\r\nyellow of the sunset sky. As darkness came on, the mists collected\r\naround the top of Mainom, accumulating on the windward side, and\r\nthrown off in ragged masses from the opposite.\r\n\r\nThe second night we passed here was fine, and not very cold (the mean\r\ntemperature being 27 degrees) and we kept ourselves quite warm by\r\npine-wood fires. On the following morning the sun tinged the sky of a\r\nlurid yellow-red: to the south-west, over the plains, the belts of\r\nleaden vapour were fewer (twelve being distinguishable) and much\r\nlower than on the previous evening, appearing as if depressed on the\r\nvisible horizon. Heavy masses of clouds nestled into all the valleys,\r\nand filled up the larger ones, the mountain tops rising above them\r\nlike islands.\r\n\r\nThe height of our position I calculated to be 10,613 feet. Colonel\r\nWaugh had determined that of the summit by trigonometry to be 10,702\r\nfeet, which probably includes the trees which cover it, or some rocky\r\npeaks on the broad and comparatively level surface.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of the twenty-four hours was 32.7 degrees (max.\r\n41.5 degrees/min. 27.2 degrees), mean dew-point 29.7, and saturation\r\n0.82. The mercury suddenly fell below the freezing point at sunset;\r\nand from early morning the radiation was so powerful, that a\r\nthermometer exposed on snow sank to 21.2 degrees, and stood at 25.5\r\ndegrees, at 10 a.m. The black bulb thermometer rose to 132 degrees,\r\nat 9 a.m. on the 27th, or 94.2 degrees above the temperature of the\r\nair in the shade. I did not then observe that of radiation from snow;\r\nbut if, as we may assume, it was not less than on the following\r\nmorning (21.2 degrees), we shall have a difference of 148.6 degrees\r\nFahr., in contiguous spots; the one exposed to the full effects of\r\nthe sun, the other to that of radiation through a rarefied medium to\r\na cloudless sky. On the 28th the black bulb thermometer, freely\r\nsuspended over the snow and exposed to the sun, rose to 108 degrees,\r\nor 78 degrees above that of the air in the shade (32 degrees); the\r\nradiating surface of the same snow in the shade being 21.2 degrees,\r\nor 86.8 degrees colder.\r\n\r\nHaving taken a complete set of angles and panoramic sketches from the\r\ntop of Mainom, with seventeen hourly observations, and collected much\r\ninformation from our guides, we returned on the 28th to our tents\r\npitched by the temples at Neongong; descending 7000 feet, a very\r\nsevere shake along Lepcha paths. In the evening the Lamas visited us,\r\nwith presents of rice, fowls, eggs, etc., and begged subscriptions\r\nfor their temple which was then building, reminding Dr. Campbell that\r\nhe and the Governor-General had an ample share of their prayers, and\r\nbenefited in proportion. As for me, they said, I was bound to give\r\nalms, as I surely needed praying for, seeing how I exposed myself;\r\nbesides my having been the first Englishman who had visited the snows\r\nof Kinchinjunga, the holiest spot in Sikkim.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we visited the unfinished temple. The outer\r\nwalls were of slabs of stone neatly chiselled, but badly mortared\r\nwith felspathic clay and pounded slate, instead of lime; the\r\npartition walls were of clay, shaped in moulds of wood; parallel\r\nplanks, four feet asunder, being placed in the intended position of\r\nthe walls, and left open above, the composition was placed in these\r\nboxes, a little at a time, and rammed down by the feet of many men,\r\nwho walked round and round the narrow enclosure, singing, and also\r\nusing rammers of heavy wood. The outer work was of good hard timber,\r\nof Magnolia (\"Pendre-kun\" of the Lepchas) land oak (\"Sokka\").\r\nThe common \"Ban,\" or Lepcha knife, supplied the place of axe, saw,\r\nadze, and plane; and the graving work was executed with small tools,\r\nchiefly on Toon (_Cedrela_), a very soft wood (the \"Simal-kun\" of\r\nthe Lepchas).\r\n\r\nThis being a festival day, when the natives were bringing offerings\r\nto the altar, we also visited the old temple, a small wooden\r\nbuilding. Besides more substantial offerings, there were little cones\r\nof rice with a round wafer of butter at the top, ranged on the altar\r\nin order.* [The worshippers, on entering, walk straight up to the\r\naltar, and before, or after, having deposited their gifts, they lift\r\nboth hands to the forehead, fall on their knees, and touch the ground\r\nthree times with both head and hands, raising the body a little\r\nbetween each prostration. They then advance to the head Lama, kotow\r\nsimilarly to him, and he blesses them, laying both hands on their\r\nheads and repeating a short formula. Sometimes the dorje is used in\r\nblessing, as the cross is in Europe, and when a mass of people\r\nrequest a benediction, the Lama pronounces it from the door of the\r\ntemple with outstretched arms, the people all being prostrate, with\r\ntheir foreheads touching the ground.] Six Lamas were at prayer,\r\npsalms, and contemplation, sitting cross-legged on two small benches\r\nthat ran down the building: one was reading, with his hand and\r\nfore-finger elevated, whilst the others listened; anon they all sang\r\nhymns, repeated sacred or silly precepts to the bystanders, or joined\r\nin a chorus with boys, who struck brass cymbals, and blew straight\r\ncopper trumpets six feet long, and conch-shells mounted with broad\r\nsilver wings, elegantly carved with dragons. There were besides\r\nmanis, or praying-cylinders, drums, gongs, books, and trumpets made\r\nof human thigh-bones, plain or mounted in silver.\r\n\r\nThroughout Sikkim, we were roused each morning at daybreak by this\r\nwild music, the convents being so numerous that we were always within\r\nhearing of it. To me it was always deeply impressive, sounding so\r\nforeign, and awakening me so effectually to the strangeness of the\r\nwild land in which I was wandering, and of the many new and striking\r\nobjects it contained. After sleep, too, during which the mind has\r\neither been at rest, or carried away to more familiar subjects, the\r\nfeelings of loneliness and sometimes even of despondency, conjured\r\nup, by this solemn music, were often almost oppressive.\r\n\r\nAscending from Neongong, we reached that pass from the Teesta to the\r\nGreat Rungeet, which I had crossed on the 22nd; and this time we had\r\na splendid view, down both the valleys, of the rivers, and the many\r\nspars from the ridge communicating between Tendong and Mainom, with\r\nmany scattered villages and patches of cultivation. Near the top I\r\nfound a plant of \"Praong,\" (a small bamboo), in full seed; this sends\r\nup many flowering branches from the root, and but few leaf-bearing\r\nones; and after maturing its seed, and giving off suckers from the\r\nroot, the parent plant dies. The fruit is a dark, long grain, like\r\nrice; it is boiled and made into cakes, or into beer, like Murwa.\r\n\r\nLooking west from the summit, no fewer than ten monastic\r\nestablishments with their temples, villages and cultivation, were at\r\nonce visible, in the valley of the Great Rungeet, and in those of its\r\ntributaries; namely, Changachelling, Raklang, Dholi, Molli,\r\nCatsuperri, Dhoobdi, Sunnook, Powhungri, Pemiongchi and Tassiding,\r\nall of considerable size, and more or less remarkable in their sites,\r\nbeing perched on spurs or peaks at elevations varying from 3000 to\r\n7000 feet, and commanding splendid prospects.\r\n\r\nWe encamped at Lingcham, where I had halted on the 21st, and the\r\nweather being fine, I took bearings of all the convents and mountains\r\naround. There is much cultivation here, and many comparatively rich\r\nvillages, all occupying flat-shouldered spurs from Mainom. The houses\r\nare large, and the yards are full of animals familiar to the eye but\r\nnot to the ear. The cows of Sikkim, though generally resembling the\r\nEnglish in stature, form, and colour, have humps, and grunt rather\r\nthan low; and the cocks wake the morning with a prolonged howling\r\nscreech, instead of the shrill crow of chanticleer.\r\n\r\nHence we descended north-west to the Great Rungeet, opposite\r\nTassiding; which is one of the oldest monastic establishments in\r\nSikkim, and one we were very anxious to visit. The descent lay\r\nthrough a forest of tropical trees, where small palms, vines,\r\npeppers, _Pandanus,_ wild plantain, and _Pothos,_ were interlaced in\r\nan impenetrable jungle, and air-plants clothed the trees.\r\n\r\nIllustration--IMPLEMENTS USED IN BOODHIST TEMPLES.\r\nPraying cylinder in stand (see Chapter VII); another to be carried in\r\nthe hand; cymbals; bell; brass cup; three trumpets; conch; dorje.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTassiding, view of and from -- Funereal cypress -- Camp at Sunnook --\r\nHot vapours -- Lama's house -- Temples, decorations, altars, idols,\r\ngeneral effect -- Chaits -- Date of erection -- Plundered by Ghorkas\r\n-- Cross Ratong -- Ascend to Pemiongchi -- Relation of river-beds to\r\nstrike of rocks -- Slopes of ravines -- Pemiongchi, view of --\r\nVegetation -- Elevation -- Temple, decorations, etc. -- Former\r\ncapital of Sikkim -- History of Sikkim -- Nightingales -- Campbell\r\ndeparts -- Tchonpong -- Edgeworthia -- Cross Rungbee and Ratong --\r\nHoar-frost on plantains -- Yoksun -- Walnuts -- View -- Funereal\r\ncypresses -- Doobdi -- Gigantic cypresses -- Temples -- Snow-fall --\r\nSikkim, etc. -- Toys.\r\n\r\nTassiding hill is the steep conical termination of a long spur from a\r\npine-clad shoulder of Kinchinjunga, called Powhungri: it divides the\r\nGreat Rungeet from its main feeder, the Ratong, which rises from the\r\nsouth face of Kinchin. We crossed the former by a bridge formed of\r\ntwo bamboo stems, slung by canes from two parallel arches of stout\r\nbranches lashed together.\r\n\r\nThe ascent for 2,800 feet was up a very steep, dry, zigzag path,\r\namongst mica slate rocks (strike north-east), on which grew many\r\ntropical plants, especially the \"Tukla,\" (_Rottlera tinctoria_), a\r\nplant which yields a brown dye. The top was a flat, curving\r\nnorth-west and south-east, covered with temples, chaits, and mendongs\r\nof the most picturesque forms and in elegant groups, and fringed with\r\nbrushwood, wild plantains, small palms, and apple-trees. Here I saw\r\nfor the first time the funereal cypress, of which some very old trees\r\nspread their weeping limbs and pensile  branchlets over the\r\nbuildings.* [I was not then aware of this tree having been introduced\r\ninto England by the intrepid Mr. Fortune from China; and as I was\r\nunable to procure seeds, which are said not to ripen in Sikkim, it\r\nwas a great and unexpected pleasure, on my return home, to find it\r\nalive and flourishing at Kew.] It is not wild in Sikkim, but imported\r\nthere and into Bhotan from Tibet: it does not thrive well above 6000\r\nfeet elevation. It is called \"Tchenden\" by the Lepchas, Bhoteeas,\r\nand Tibetans, and its fragrant red wood is burnt in the temples.\r\n\r\nIllustration--GROUP OF CHAITS AT PASSIDING.\r\n\r\nThe Lamas met us on the top of the hill, bringing a noble present of\r\nfowls, vegetables and oranges, the latter most acceptable after our\r\nlong and hot march. The site is admirably chosen, in the very heart\r\nof Sikkim, commanding a fine view, and having a considerable river on\r\neither side,  with the power of retreating behind to the convents of\r\nSunnook and Powhungri, which are higher up on the same spur, and\r\nsurrounded by forest enough to conceal an army. Considering the\r\nturbulent and warlike character of their neighbours, it is not\r\nwonderful that the monks should have chosen commanding spots, and\r\ngood shelter for their indolent lives: for the same reason these\r\nmonasteries secured views of one another: thus from Tassiding the\r\ngreat temple of Pemiongchi was seen towering 3000 feet over head,\r\nwhilst to the north-west, up the course of the river, the hill-sides\r\nseemed sprinkled with monasteries.\r\n\r\nWe camped on a saddle near the village of Sunnook, at 4000 feet above\r\nthe sea; and on the last day of the year we visited this most\r\ninteresting monastic establishment: ascending from our camp along the\r\nridge by a narrow path, cut here and there into steps, and passing\r\nmany rocks covered with inscriptions, broken walls of mendongs, and\r\nother remains of the _via sacra_ between the village and temple.\r\nAt one spot we found a fissure emitting hot vapour of the temperature\r\nof 65.5 degrees, that of the air being about 50 degrees. It was\r\nsimply a hole amongst the rocks; and near the Rungeet a similar one\r\nis said to occur, whose temperature fluctuates considerably with the\r\nseason. It is very remarkable that such an isolated spring should\r\nexist on the top of a sharp ridge, 2,800 feet above the bottom of\r\nthis deep valley.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement on the summit was, first the Lamas' houses\r\nwith small gardens, then three large temples raised on rudely paged\r\nplatforms, and beyond these, a square walled enclosure facing the\r\nsouth, full of chaits and mendongs, looking like a crowded cemetery,\r\nand planted with funereal cypress (_Cupressus funebris_).\r\n\r\nThe house of the principal Lama was an oblong square,  the lower\r\nstory of stone, and the upper of wood: we ascended a ladder to the\r\nupper room, which was 24 feet by 8 wattled all round, with prettily\r\nlatticed windows opening upon a bamboo balcony used for drying grain,\r\nunder the eaves of the broad thatched roof. The ceiling (of neat\r\nbamboo work) was hung with glorious bunches of maize, yellow, red,\r\nand brown; an altar and closed wicker cage at one end of the room\r\nheld the Penates, and a few implements of worship. Chinese carpets\r\nwere laid on the floor for us, and the cans of Murwa brought round.\r\n\r\nThe Lama, though one of the red sect, was dressed in a yellow\r\nflowered silk robe, but his mitre was red: he gave us much\r\ninformation relative to the introduction of Boodhism into Sikkim.\r\n\r\nThe three temples stand about fifty yards apart, but are not parallel\r\nto one another, although their general direction is east and west.*\r\n[Timkowski, in his travels through Mongolia (i. p. 193), says,\r\n\"According to the rules of Tibetan architecture, temples should face\r\nthe south:\" this is certainly not the rule in Sikkim, nor, so far as\r\nI could learn, in Tibet either.] Each is oblong, and narrowed\r\nupwards, with the door at one end; the middle (and smallest) faces\r\nthe west, the others the east: the doorways are all broad, low and\r\ndeep, protected by a projecting carved portico. The walls are\r\nimmensely thick, of well-masoned slaty stones; the outer surface of\r\neach slopes upwards and inwards, the inner is perpendicular.\r\nThe roofs are low and thickly thatched, and project from eight to ten\r\nfeet all round, to keep off the rain, being sometimes supported by\r\nlong poles. There is a very low upper story, inhabited by the\r\nattendant monks and servants, accessible by a ladder at one end of\r\nthe building. The main body of the temple is one large apartment,\r\nentered through a small transverse vestibule, the breadth of the\r\ntemple, in which are tall cylindrical  praying-machines. The carving\r\nround the doors is very beautiful, and they are gaudily painted\r\nand gilded.\r\n\r\nIllustration--DOORWAY.\r\n\r\nThe northern temple is quite plain: the middle one is simply painted\r\nred, and encircled with a row of black heads, with goggle eyes and\r\nnumerous teeth, on a white ground; it is said to have been originally\r\ndedicated to the evil spirits of the Lepcha creed. The southern,\r\nwhich contains the library, is the largest and best, and is of an\r\nirregular square shape. The inside walls and floors are plastered\r\nwith clay, and painted with allegorical representations of Boodh,\r\netc. From the vestibule the principal apartment is entered by broad\r\nfolding-doors, studded with circular copper bosses, and turning on\r\niron hinges. It is lighted by latticed windows, sometimes protected\r\noutside by a bamboo screen. Owing to the great thickness of the walls\r\n (three to four feet), a very feeble light is admitted. In the\r\nprincipal temple, called \"Dugang,\" six hexagonal wooden columns,\r\nnarrowed above, with peculiar broad transverse capitals, exquisitely\r\ngilded and painted, support the cross-beams of the roof, which are\r\nlikewise beautifully ornamented. Sometimes a curly-maned gilt lion is\r\nplaced over a column, and it is always furnished with a black bushy\r\ntail: squares, diamonds, dragons, and groups of flowers, vermilion,\r\ngreen, gold, azure, and white, are dispersed with great artistic\r\ntaste over all the beams; the heavier masses of colour being\r\nseparated by fine white lines.\r\n\r\nIllustration--SOUTHERN TEMPLE.\r\n\r\nThe altars and idols are placed at the opposite end; and two long\r\nparallel benches, like cathedral stalls, run down the centre of the\r\nbuilding: on these the monks sit at  prayer and contemplation, the\r\nhead Lama occupying a stall (often of very tasteful design) near\r\nthe altar.\r\n\r\nIllustration--MIDDLE TEMPLE.\r\n\r\nThe principal Boodh, or image, is placed behind the altar under a\r\ncanopy, or behind a silk screen: lesser gods, and gaily dressed and\r\npainted effigies of sainted male or female persons are ranged on\r\neither side, or placed in niches around the apartment, sometimes with\r\nseparate altars before them; whilst the walls are more or less\r\ncovered with paintings of monks in prayer or contemplation.\r\nThe principal Boodh (Sakya Sing) sits cross-legged, with the left\r\nheel up: his left-hand always rests on his thigh, and holds the padmi\r\nor lotus and jewel, which is often a mere cup; the right-hand is\r\neither raised, with the two forefingers up, or holds the dorje, or\r\nrests on the  calf of the upturned leg. Sakya has generally curled\r\nhair, Lamas have mitres, females various head-dresses; most wear\r\nimmense ear-rings, and some rosaries. All are placed on rude\r\npediments, so painted as to convey the idea of their rising out of\r\nthe petals of the pink, purple, or white lotus. None are in any way\r\ndisagreeable; on the contrary most have a calm and pleasing\r\nexpression, suggestive of contemplation.\r\n\r\nIllustration--ALTAR AND IMAGES.\r\nCentral figure Akshobya, the first of the Pancha Boodha.\r\n\r\nThe great or south temple contained a side altar of very elegant\r\nshape, placed before an image encircled by a glory. Flowers, juniper,\r\npeacock's feathers, pastiles, and rows of brass cups of water were\r\nthe chief ornaments of the altars,  besides the instruments I have\r\nelsewhere enumerated. In this temple was the library, containing\r\nseveral hundred books, in pigeon-holes, placed in recesses.* [For a\r\nparticular account of the images and decorations of these temples,\r\nsea Dr. Campbell's paper in \"Bengal Asiatic Society's Trans.,\" May,\r\n1849. The principal object of veneration amongst the Ningma or red\r\nsect of Boodhists in Sikkim and Bhotan is Gorucknath, who is always\r\nrepresented sitting cross-legged, holding the dorje in one hand,\r\nwhich is raised; whilst the left rests in the lap and holds a cup\r\nwith a jewel in it. The left arm supports a trident, whose staff\r\npierces three sculls (a symbol of Shiva), a rosary hangs round his\r\nneck, and he wears a red mitre with a lunar crescent and sun\r\nin front.]\r\n\r\nIllustration--PLAN OF THE SOUTH TEMPLE.\r\nA. entrance; B. four praying cylinders; C. altar, with seven brass\r\ncups of water; D. four columns; E. and F. images; G. library.\r\n\r\nThe effect on entering these cold and gloomy temples is very\r\nimpressive; the Dugang in particular is exquisitely ornamented and\r\npainted, and the vista from the vestibule to the principal idol, of\r\ncarved and coloured pillars and beams, is very picturesque.\r\nWithin, the general arrangement of the colours and gilding is felt to\r\nbe harmonious and pleasing, especially from the introduction of\r\nslender white streaks between the contrasting masses of colour,  as\r\nadopted in the Great Exhibition building of 1851. It is also well\r\nworthy of remark that the brightest colours are often used in broad\r\nmasses, and when so, are always arranged chromatically, in the\r\nsequence of the rainbow's hues, and are hence never displeasing to\r\nthe eye. The hues, though bright, are subdued by the imperfect light:\r\nthe countenances of the images are all calm, and their expression\r\nsolemn. Whichever way you turn, the eye is met by some beautiful\r\nspecimen of colouring or carving, or some object of veneration.\r\nThe effect is much heightened by the incense of juniper and\r\nsweet-smelling herbs which the priests burn on entering, by their\r\ngrave and decorous conduct, and by the feeling of respect that is\r\ndemanded by a religion which theoretically inculcates and adores\r\nvirtue in the abstract, and those only amongst men who practise\r\nvirtue. To the idol itself the Boodhist attaches no real importance;\r\nit is an object of reverence, not of worship, and no virtue or\r\nattribute belong to it _per se_; it is a symbol of the creed, and the\r\nadoration is paid to the holy man whom it represents.\r\n\r\nBeyond the temples are the chaits and mendongs, scattered without\r\nmuch order; and I counted nearly twenty-five chaits of the same\r\nform,* [In Sikkim the form of the cube alone is always strictly\r\npreserved; that of the pyramid and hemisphere being often much\r\nmodified. The cube stands on a flight of usually three steps, and is\r\nsurmounted by a low pyramid of five steps; on this is placed a\r\nswelling, urn-shaped body, which represents the hemisphere, and is\r\nsurmounted by another cube. On the latter is a slender, round or\r\nangled spire (represented by a pyramid in Burma), crowned with a\r\ncrescent and disc, or sun, in moon. Generally, the whole is of stone,\r\nwith the exception of the spire, which is of wood, painted red.]\r\nbetween eight and thirty feet high. The largest is consecrated to the\r\nmemory of the Rajah's eldest son, who, however, is not buried here.\r\nA group of these structures is, as I have often remarked, extremely\r\npicturesque, and those at Tassiding, from their  number, variety, and\r\nsize, their commanding and romantic position, and their being\r\ninterspersed with weeping cypresses, are particularly so.\r\n\r\nThe Tassiding temples and convents were founded upwards of 300 years\r\nago, by the Lamas who accompanied the first Rajah to Sikkim; and they\r\nhave been continuously served by Lamas of great sanctity, many of\r\nwhom have been educated at Lhassa. They were formerly very wealthy,\r\nbut during the Nepal war they were plundered of all their treasures,\r\ntheir silver gongs and bells, their best idols, dorjes, and manis,\r\nand stripped of their ornaments; since which time Pemiongchi has been\r\nmore popular. In proof of their antiquity, it was pointed out that\r\nmost of the symbols and decorations were those of pure Lama Boodhism,\r\nas practised in Tibet.\r\n\r\nAlthough the elevation is but 4,840 feet, the weather was cold and\r\nraw, with rain at noon, followed by thunder and lightning.\r\nThese electrical disturbances are frequent about midsummer and\r\nmidwinter, prevailing over many parts of India.\r\n\r\n_January 1st_, 1849.--The morning of the new year was bright and\r\nbeautiful, though much snow had fallen on the mountains; and we left\r\nSunnook for Pemiongchi, situated on the summit of a lofty spur on the\r\nopposite side of the Ratong. We descended very steeply to the bed of\r\nthe river (alt. 2,480 feet) which joins the Great Rungeet below the\r\nconvents. The rocks were micaceous, dipping west and north-west 45\r\ndegrees, and striking north and north-east, which direction prevailed\r\nfor 1000 feet or so up the opposite spur. I had observed the same dip\r\nand stroke on the east flank of the Tassiding spur; but both the\r\nRatong on its west side, and the Great Rungeet on the east, flow in\r\nchannels that show no relation to either the dip or strike.  I have\r\ngenerally remarked in Sikkim that the channels of the rivers when\r\ncutting through or flowing at the base of bluff cliffs, are neither\r\nparallel to nor at right angles to the strike of the rocks forming\r\nthe cliffs. I do not hence conclude that there is no original\r\nconnection between the directions of the rivers, and the lines of\r\nfracture; but whatever may have once subsisted between the direction\r\nof the fissures and that of the strike, it is in the Sikkim Himalaya\r\nnow wholly masked by shiftings, which accompanied subequent\r\nelevations and depressions.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins has mathematically demonstrated that the continued\r\nexertion of a force in raising superimposed strata would tend to\r\nproduce two classes of fractures in those strata; those of the first\r\norder at right angles to the direction of the wave or ridge (or line\r\nof strike); those of the second order parallel to the strike.\r\nSupposing the force to be withdrawn after the formation of the two\r\nfractures, the result would be a ridge, or mountain chain, with\r\ndiverging fissures from the summit, crossed by concentric fissures;\r\nand the courses which the rivers would take in flowing down the\r\nridge, would successively be at right angles and parallel to the\r\nstrike of the strata. Now, in the Himalaya, a prevalent strike to the\r\nnorth-west has been recognised in all parts of the chain, but it is\r\neverywhere interfered with by mountains presenting every other\r\ndirection of strike, and by their dip never remaining constant either\r\nin amount or direction. Consequently, as might be expected, the\r\ndirections of the river channels bear no apparent relation to the\r\ngeneral strike of the rocks.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the Ratong (twenty yards broad) by a cane bridge,\r\nsuspended between two rocks of green chlorite, full of veins of\r\ngranite. Ascending, we passed the village of Kameti on a spur, on the\r\nface of which  were strewed some enormous detached blocks of white\r\nand pink stratified quartz: the rocks _in situ_ were all\r\nchlorite schist.\r\n\r\nLooking across the valley to the flank of Mainom, the disposition of\r\nthe ridges and ravines on its sides was very evident; many of the\r\nlatter, throughout their westerly course, from their commencement at\r\n10,000 feet, to their debouchure in the Great Rungeet at 2000, had a\r\nbluff, cliffy, northern flank, and a sloping southern one. The dip of\r\nthe surfaces is, therefore, north-west, the exposure consequently of\r\nthe villages which occupy terraces on the south flanks of the lateral\r\nvalleys. The Tassiding spur presented exactly the same arrangement of\r\nits ravines, and the dip of the rocks being north-west, it follows\r\nthat the planes of the sloping surfaces coincide in direction (though\r\nnot in amount of inclination) with that of the dip of the subjacent\r\nstrata, which is anything but a usual phenomenon in Sikkim.\r\n\r\nThe ascent to Pemiongchi continued very steep, through woods of oaks,\r\nchesnuts, and magnolias, but no tree-fern, palms, _Pothos,_ or\r\nplantain, which abound at this elevation on the moister outer ranges\r\nof Sikkim. The temple (elev. 7,083 feet) is large, eighty feet long,\r\nand in excellent order, built upon the lofty terminal point of the\r\ngreat east and west spur that divides the Kulhait from the Ratong and\r\nRungbee rivers; and the great Changachelling temple and monastery\r\nstand on another eminence of the same ridge, two miles further west.\r\n\r\nThe view of the snowy range from this temple is one of the finest in\r\nSikkim; the eye surveying at one glance the vegetation of the Tropics\r\nand the Poles. Deep in the valleys the river-beds are but 3000 feet\r\nabove the sea, and are choked with fig-trees, plantains, and palms;\r\nto  these succeed laurels and magnolias, and higher up still, oaks,\r\nchesnuts, birches, etc.; there is, however, no marked line between\r\nthe limits of these two last forests, which form the prevailing\r\narboreous vegetation between 4000 and 10,000 feet, and give a lurid\r\nline to the mountains. Pine forests succeed for 2000 feet higher,\r\nwhen they give place to a skirting of rhododendron and berberry.\r\nAmong these appear black naked rocks, rising up in cliffs, between\r\nwhich are gulleys, down which the snow now (on the 1st January)\r\ndescended to 12,000 feet. The mountain flanks are much more steep and\r\nrocky than those at similar heights on the outer ranges, and\r\ncataracts are very numerous, and of considerable height, though small\r\nin volume.\r\n\r\nPemiongchi is at the same elevation as Dorjiling, and the contrast\r\nbetween the shoulders of 8000 to 10,000 feet on Kinchinjunga, and\r\nthose of equal height on Tendong and Tonglo, is very remarkable:\r\nlooking at the latter mountains from Dorjiling, the observer sees no\r\nrock, waterfall, or pine, throughout their whole height; whereas the\r\nequally wooded flanks of these inner ranges are rocky, streaked with\r\nthread-like waterfalls, and bristling with silver firs.\r\n\r\nThis temple, the most ancient in Sikkim, is said to be 400 years old;\r\nit stands on a paved platform, and is of the same form and general\r\ncharacter as those of Tassiding. Inside, it is most beautifully\r\ndecorated, especially the beams, columns, capitals and architraves,\r\nbut the designs are coarser than those of Tassiding.* [Mr. Hodgson\r\ninformed me that many of the figures and emblems in this temple are\r\nthose of Tantrica Boodhism, including Shiva, Devi, and other deities\r\nusually called Brahminical; Kakotak, or the snake king, a figure\r\nterminating below in a snake, is also seen; with the tiger, elephant,\r\nand curly-maned lion.] The square end of every beam in the roof is\r\nornamented either with a lotus flower or with a Tibetan character, in\r\nendless diversity of colour and form, and the walls are completely\r\ncovered with allegorical paintings of Lamas and saints expounding or\r\nin contemplation, with glories round their heads, mitred, and holding\r\nthe dole and jewel.\r\n\r\nIllustration--INTERIOR OF THE TEMPLE AT PEMIONGCHI.\r\n\r\nThe principal image is a large and hideous figure of Sakya-thoba, in\r\na recess under a blue silk canopy, contrasting with a calm figure of\r\nthe late Rajah, wearing a cap and coronet.\r\n\r\nPemiongchi was once the capital of Sikkim, and called the Sikkim\r\nDurbar: the Rajah's residence was on a curious flat to the south of\r\nthe temple, and a few hundred feet below it, where are the remains of\r\n(for this country) extensive walls and buildings. During the Nepal\r\nwar, the Rajah was driven west across the Teesta, whilst the Ghorkas\r\nplundered Tassiding, Pemiongchi, Changachelling, and all the temples\r\nand convents to the east of that river. It was then that the famous\r\nhistory of Sikkim,* [This remarkable and beautiful manuscript was\r\nwritten on thick oblong sheets of Tibet paper, painted black to\r\nresist decay, and the letters were yellow and gold. The Nepalese\r\nsoldiers wantonly employed the sheets to roof the sheds they erected,\r\nas a protection from the weather.] compiled by the Lamas of\r\nPemiongchi, and kept at this temple, was destroyed, with the\r\nexception of a few sheets, with one of which Dr. Campbell and myself\r\nwere each presented. We were told that the monks of Changachelling\r\nand those of this establishmont had copied what remained, and were\r\nbusy compiling from oral information, etc.: whatever value the\r\noriginal may have possessed, however, is irretrievably lost.\r\nA magnificent copy of the Boodhist Scriptures was destroyed at the\r\nsame time; it consisted of 400 volumes, each containing several\r\nhundred sheets of Daphne paper.\r\n\r\nThe ground about the temple was snowed; and we descended a few\r\nhundred feet, to encamp in a most picturesque grove, among chaits and\r\ninscribed stones, with  a peep of the temples above. Nightingales\r\nwarbled deliciously night and morning, which rather surprised us, as\r\nthe minimum thermometer fell to 27.8 degrees, and the ground next day\r\nwas covered with hoar-frost; the elevation being 6,580 feet.\r\nThese birds migrate hither in October and November, lingering in the\r\nHimalayan valleys till the cold of early spring drives them further\r\nsouth, to the plains of India, whence they return north in March\r\nand April.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of January I parted from my friend, who was obliged to\r\nhurry to the great annual fair at Titalya. I regretted much being\r\nunable to accompany Dr. Campbell to this scene of his disinterested\r\nlabours, especially as the Nawab of Moorshedabad was to be present,\r\none of the few wealthy native princes of Bengal who still keep a\r\ncourt worth seeing; but I was more anxious to continue my\r\nexplorations northward till the latest moment: I however accompanied\r\nhim for a short distance on his way towards Dorjiling. We passed the\r\nold Durbar, called Phieungoong (\"Bamboo-hill,\" so named from the\r\nabundance of a small bamboo, \"Phieung.\") The buildings, now in ruins,\r\noccupy a little marshy flat, hemmed in by slate rocks, and covered\r\nwith brambles and _Andromeda_ bushes. A wall, a bastion, and an\r\narched gateway, are the only traces of fortifications; they are\r\nclothed with mosses, lichens, and ferns.\r\n\r\nA steep zigzag path, descending amongst long grass and scarlet\r\nrhododendrons, leads to the Kaysing Mendong.* [Described at Chapter\r\nXII.] Here I bade adieu to Dr. Campbell, and toiled up the hill,\r\nfeeling very lonely. The zest with which he had entered into all my\r\npursuits, and the aid he had afforded me, together with the charm\r\nthat always attends companionship with one who enjoys every incident\r\nof travel, had so attracted me to him that I found it difficult to\r\nrecover my spirits.  It is quite impossible for anyone who cannot\r\nfrom experience realise the solitary wandering life I had been\r\nleading for months, to appreciate the desolate feeling that follows\r\nthe parting from one who has heightened every enjoyment, and taken\r\nfar more than his share of every annoyance and discomfort: the few\r\ndays we had spent together appeared then, and still, as months.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Pemiongchi I spent the remainder of the day sketching\r\nin the great temple, gossiping with the Lamas, and drinking salted\r\nand buttered tea-soup, which I had begun to like, when the butter was\r\nnot rancid.\r\n\r\nMy route hence was to be along the south flank of Kinchinjunga, north\r\nto Jongri, which lay about four or five marches off, on the road to\r\nthe long deserted pass of Kanglanamo, by which I had intended\r\nentering Sikkim from Nepal, when I found the route up the Yalloong\r\nvalley impracticable. The village and ruined convents of Yoksun lay\r\nnear the route, and the temples of Doobdi, Catsuperri and Molli, on\r\nthe Ratong river.\r\n\r\nI descended to the village of Tchonpong (alt. 4,980 feet), where I\r\nwas detained a day to obtain rice, of which I required ten days'\r\nsupply for twenty-five people. On the way I passed groves of the\r\npaper-yielding _Edgeworthia Gardneri_: it bears round heads of\r\nfragrant, beautiful, yellow flowers, and would be a valuable\r\nacquisition to an English conservatory.\r\n\r\nFrom Tchonpong we descended to the bed of the Rungbee (alt. 3,160\r\nfeet), an affluent of the Ratong, flowing in a deep galley with\r\nprecipitous sides of mica schist full of garnets, dipping west and\r\nnorth-west 45 degrees: it was spanned by a bridge of two loose bamboo\r\nculms, about fifteen yards long, laid across without handrails; after\r\nwet sand had been thrown on it the bare-footed coolies crossed\r\neasily enough, but I, having shoes on, required a hand to steady me.\r\nFrom this point we crossed a lofty spur to the Ratong (alt. 3000\r\nfeet), where we encamped, the coolies being unable to proceed further\r\non such very bad roads. This river descends from the snows of\r\nKinchin, and consequently retains the low temperature 42 degrees,\r\nbeing fully 7 degrees colder than the Rungbee, which at an elevation\r\nof but 3000 feet appears very remarkable: it must however be observed\r\nthat scarcely anywhere does the sun penetrate to the bottom of\r\nits valley.\r\n\r\nWe encamped on a gravelly flat, fifty feet above the river, strewn\r\nwith water-worn boulders, and so densely covered with tall\r\n_Artemisiae,_ gigantic grasses, bamboo, plantain, fern, and acacia,\r\nthat we had to clear a space in the jungle, which exhaled a rank\r\nheavy smell.\r\n\r\nHoar-frost formed copiously in the night, and though above the sun's\r\nrays were very powerful, they did not reach this spot till 7.30 a.m.,\r\nthe frost remaining in the shade till nearly 9 a.m.; and this on\r\nplantains, and other inhabitants of hot-houses in England.\r\n\r\nHence I ascended to Yoksun, one of the most curious and picturesque\r\nspots in Sikkim, and the last inhabited place towards Kinchinjunga.\r\nThe path was excessively steep and rocky for the first mile or two,\r\nand then alternately steep and flat. Mixed with many tropical trees,\r\nwere walnuts of the common English variety; a tree, which, though\r\nplanted here, is wild near Dorjiling, where it bears a full-sized\r\nfruit, as hard as a hickory-nut: those I gathered in this place were\r\nsimilar, whereas in Bhotan the cultivated nut is larger,\r\nthin-shelled, and the kernel is easily removed. We ascended one\r\nslope, of an angle of 36 degrees 30 minutes, which was covered with\r\nlight black mould, and had been recently cleared by fire: we found\r\nmillet  now cultivated on it. From the top the view of the Ratong\r\nvalley was very fine: to the north lay Yoksun, appearing from this\r\nheight to occupy a flat, two miles long and one broad, girdled by\r\nsteep mountains to the north and east, dipping very suddenly 2,200\r\nfeet to the Ratong on the west. To the right was a lofty hill,\r\ncrowned with the large temple and convents of Doobdi, shadowed by\r\nbeautiful weeping cypresses, and backed by lofty pine-clad mountains.\r\nNorthward, the gorge of the Ratong opened as a gloomy defile, above\r\nwhich rose partially snowed mountains, which shut out Kinchinjunga.\r\nTo the west, massive pine-clad mountains rose steeply; while the\r\nlittle hamlet of Lathiang occupied a remarkable shelf overhanging the\r\nriver, appearing inaccessible except by ropes from above. South-west,\r\nthe long spurs of Molli and Catsuperri, each crowned with convents or\r\ntemples, descended from Singalelah; and parallel to them on the\r\nsouth; but much longer and more lofty, was the great mountain range\r\nnorth of the Kulbait, with the temples and convents of Pemiongchi,\r\nand Changachelling, towering in the air. The latter range dips\r\nsuddenly to the Great Rungeet, where Tassiding, with its chaits and\r\ncypresses, closed the view. The day was half cloud, half sunshine;\r\nand the various effects of light and shade, now bringing out one or\r\nother of the villages and temples, now casting the deep valleys into\r\ndarker gloom, was wonderfully fine.\r\n\r\nYoksun was the earliest civilised corner of Sikkim, and derived its\r\nname (which signifies in Lepcha \"three chiefs\") from having been the\r\nresidence of three Lamas of great influence, who were the means of\r\nintroducing the first Tibetan sovereign into the country. At present\r\nit boasts of but little cultivation, and a scattered population,\r\ninhabiting a few hamlets, 5,500 feet above the sea: beautiful lanes\r\nand paths wind everywhere over the gentle slopes, and through the\r\ncopsewood that has replaced the timber-trees of a former period.\r\nMendongs and chaits are very numerous, some of great size; and there\r\nare also the ruins of two very large temples, near which are some\r\nmagnificent weeping cypresses, eighty feet high. These fine trees are\r\nlandmarks from all parts of the flat; they form irregular cones of\r\npale bright green, with naked gnarled tops, the branches weep\r\ngracefully, but not like the picture in Macartney's Embassy to China,\r\nwhence originated the famous willow-pattern of our crockery.\r\nThe ultimate branchlets are very slender and pendulous; my Lepcha\r\nboys used to make elegant chaplets of them, binding the withes with\r\nscarlet worsted. The trunk is quite erect, smooth, cylindrical, and\r\npine-like; it harbours no moss, but air-plants, Orchids, and ferns,\r\nnestle on the limbs, and pendulous lichens, like our beard-moss, wave\r\nfrom the branches.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I ascended to Doobdi. The path was broad, and\r\nskilfully conducted up a very steep slope covered with forest: the\r\ntop, which is 6,470 feet above the sea, and nearly 1000 above Yoksun,\r\nis a broad partially paved platform, on which stand two temples,\r\nsurrounded by beautiful cypresses: one of these trees (perhaps the\r\noldest in Sikkim) measured sixteen and a half feet in girth, at five\r\nfeet from the ground, and was apparently ninety feet high: it was not\r\npyramidal, the top branches being dead and broken, and the lower\r\nlimbs spreading; they were loaded with masses of white-flowered\r\nCoelogynes, and Vacciniums. The younger trees were pyramidal.\r\n\r\nI was received by a monk of low degree, who made many apologies for\r\nthe absence of his superior, who had  been ordered an eight years'\r\npenance and seclusion from the world, of which only three had passed.\r\nOn inquiry, I learnt the reason for this; the holy father having\r\nfound himself surrounded by a family, to which there would have been\r\nno objection, had he previously obtained a dispensation. As, however,\r\nhe had omitted this preliminary, and was able to atone by prayer and\r\npayment, he had been condemned to do penance; probably at his own\r\nsuggestion, as the seclusion will give him sanctity, and eventually\r\nlead to his promotion, when his error shall have been forgotten.\r\n\r\nIllustration--TEMPLE AND WEEPING CYPRESS.\r\n\r\nBoth temples are remarkable for their heavily ornamented, two-storied\r\nporticos, which occupy nearly the whole of one end. The interior\r\ndecorations are in a ruinous  condition, and evidently very old; they\r\nhave no Hindoo emblems.\r\n\r\nThe head Lama sent me a present of dried peaches, with a bag of\r\nwalnuts, called \"Koal-kun\" by the Lepchas, and \"Taga-sching\" by the\r\nBhoteeas; the two terminations alike signifying \"tree.\"\r\n\r\nThe view of Yoksun from this height was very singular: it had the\r\nappearance of an enormous deposit banked up against a spur to the\r\nsouth, and mountains to the east, and apparently levelled by the\r\naction of water: this deposit seemed as though, having once\r\ncompletely filled the valley of the Ratong, that river had cut a\r\ngorge 2000 feet deep between it and the opposite mountain.\r\n\r\nAlthough the elevation is so low, snow falls abundantly at Doobdi in\r\nwinter; I was assured that it has been known of the depth of five\r\nfeet, a statement I consider doubtful; the quantity is, however,\r\ncertainly greater than at equal heights about Dorjiling, no doubt\r\nowing to its proximity to Kinchinjunga.\r\n\r\nI was amused here by watching a child playing with a popgun, made of\r\nbamboo, similar to that of quill, with which most English children\r\nare familiar, which propels pellets by means of a spring-trigger made\r\nof the upper part of the quill. It is easy to conclude such\r\nresemblances between the familiar toys of different countries to be\r\naccidental, but I question their being really so. On the plains of\r\nIndia, men may often be seen for hours together, flying what with us\r\nare children's kites; and I procured a jews'-harp from Tibet.\r\nThese are not the toys of savages, but the amusements of people more\r\nthan half-civilised, and with whom we have had indirect communication\r\nfrom the earliest ages. The Lepchas play at quoits, using slate for\r\nthe purpose, and at the Highland  games of \"putting the stone\" and\r\n\"drawing the stone.\" Chess, dice, draughts, Punch, hockey, and\r\nbattledore and shuttlecock, are all Indo-Chinese or Tartarian; and no\r\none familiar with the wonderful instances of similarity between the\r\nmonasteries, ritual, ceremonies, attributes, vestments, and other\r\nparaphernalia of the eastern and western churches, can fail to\r\nacknowledge the importance of recording even the most trifling\r\nanalogies or similarities between the manners and customs of the\r\nyoung as well as of the old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nLeave Yoksun for Kinchinjunga -- Ascend Ratong valley --\r\nSalt-smuggling over Ratong -- Landslips -- Plants -- Buckeem --\r\nBlocks of gneiss -- Mon Lepcha -- View -- Weather -- View from Gubroo\r\n-- Kinchinjunga, tops of -- Pundim cliff -- Nursing -- Vegetation of\r\nHimalaya -- Coup d'oeil of Jongri -- Route to Yalloong -- Arduous\r\nroute of salt-traders from Tibet -- Kinchin, ascent of -- Lichens --\r\nSurfaces sculptured by snow and ice -- Weather at Jongri -- Snow --\r\nShades for eyes.\r\n\r\nI left Yoksun on an expedition to Kinchinjunga on the 7th of January.\r\nIt was evident that at this season I could not attain any height; but\r\nI was most anxious to reach the lower limit of that mass of perpetual\r\nsnow which descends in one continuous sweep from 28,000 to 15,000\r\nfeet, and radiates from the summit of Kinchin, along every spur and\r\nshoulder for ten to fifteen miles, towards each point of the compass.\r\n\r\nThe route lay for the first mile over the Yoksun flat, and then wound\r\nalong the almost precipitous east flank of the Ratong, 1000 feet\r\nabove its bed, leading through thick forest. It was often difficult,\r\ncrossing torrents by calms of bamboo, and leading up precipices by\r\nnotched poles and roots of trees. I wondered what could have induced\r\nthe frequenting of such a route to Nepal, when there were so many\r\nbetter ones over Singalelah, till I found from my guide that he had\r\nhabitually smuggled salt over this pass to avoid the oppressive duty\r\nlevelled by the Dewan on all imports from Tibet by the eastern\r\npasses: he further told  me that it took five days to reach Yalloong\r\nin Nepal front Yoksun, on the third of which the Kanglanamo pass is\r\ncrossed, which is open from April to November, but is always heavily\r\nsnowed. Owing to this duty, and the remoteness of the eastern passes,\r\nthe people on the west side of the Great Rungeet were compelled to\r\npay an enormous sum for salt; and the Lamas of Changachelling and\r\nPemiongchi petitioned Dr. Campbell to use his influence with the\r\nNepal Court to have the Kanglanamo pass re-opened, and the power of\r\ntrading with the Tibetans of Wallanchoon, Yangma, and Kambachen,\r\nrestored to them: the pass having been closed since the Nepalese war,\r\nto prevent the Sikkim people from kidnapping children and slaves, as\r\nwas alleged to be their custom.* [An accusation in which there was\r\nprobably some truth; for the Sikkim Dingpun, who guided Dr. Campbell\r\nand myself to Mainom, Tassiding, etc., since kidnapped, or caused to\r\nbe abducted, a girl of Brahmin parents, from the Mai valley of Nepal,\r\na transaction which cost him some 300 rupees. The Nepal Durbar was\r\nnaturally furious, the more so as the Dingpun had no caste, and was\r\ntherefore abhorred by all Brahmins. Restitution was demanded through\r\nDr. Campbell, who caused the incensed Dingpun to give up his paramour\r\nand her jewels. He vowed vengeance against Dr. Campbell, and found\r\nmeans to gratify it, as I shall hereafter show.]\r\n\r\nWe passed some immense landslips, which had swept the forest into the\r\ntorrent, and exposed white banks of angular detritus of gneiss and\r\ngranite: we crossed one 200 yards long, by a narrow treacherous path,\r\non a slope of 35 degrees: the subjacent gneiss was nearly vertical,\r\nstriking north-east. We camped at 6,670 feet, amongst a vegetation I\r\nlittle expected to find so close to the snows of Kinchin; it\r\nconsisted of oak, maple, birch, laurel, rhododendron, white\r\n_Daphne,_ jessamine, _Arum, Begonia, Cyrtandraceae,_ pepper,\r\nfig, _Menispermum,_ wild cinnamon, _Scitamineae,_ several epiphytic\r\norchids, vines, and ferns in great abundance.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, I proceeded north-west up the Ratong river,\r\nhere a furious torrent; which we crossed,  and then ascended a very\r\nsteep mountain called \"Mon Lepcha.\" Immense detached masses of\r\ngneiss, full of coarse garnets, lay on the slope, some of which were\r\ncuriously marked with a series of deep holes, large enough to put\r\none's fist in, and said to be the footprints of the sacred cow.\r\nThey appeared to me to have been caused by the roots of trees, which\r\nspread over the rocks in these humid regions, and wear channels in\r\nthe hardest material, especially when they follow the direction of\r\nits lamination or stratification.\r\n\r\nI encamped at a place called Buckeem (alt. 8,650 ft.), in a forest of\r\n_Abies Brunoniana_ and _Webbiana,_ yew, oak, various rhododendrons,\r\nand small bamboo. Snow lay in patches at 8000 feet, and the night was\r\ncold and clear. On the following morning I continued the ascent,\r\nalternately up steeps and along perfectly level shelves, on which\r\nwere occasionally frozen pools, surrounded with dwarf juniper and\r\nrhododendrons. Across one I observed the track of a yak in the snow;\r\nit presented two ridges, probably from the long hair of this animal,\r\nwhich trails on the ground, sweeping the snow from the centre of its\r\npath. At 11,000 feet the snow lay deep and soft in the woods of\r\nsilver fir, and the coolies waded through it with difficulty.\r\n\r\nEnormous fractured boulders of gneiss were frequent over the whole of\r\nMon Lepcha, from 7000 to 11,000 feet: they were of the same material\r\nas the rock _in situ,_ and as unaccountable in their origin as the\r\nloose blocks on Dorjiling and Sinchul spurs at similar elevations,\r\noften cresting narrow ridges. I measured one angular detached block,\r\nforty feet high, resting on a steep narrow shoulder of the spur, in a\r\nposition to which it was impossible it could have rolled; and it is\r\nequally difficult to suppose that glacial ice deposited it 4000 feet\r\nabove the bottom of the gorge,  except we conclude the valley to have\r\nbeen filled with ice to that depth. A glance at the map will show\r\nthat Mon Lepcha is remarkably situated, opposite the face of\r\nKinchinjunga, and at the great bend of the Ratong. Had that valley\r\never been filled with water during a glacial period, Mon Lepcha would\r\nhave formed a promontory, and many floating bergs from Kinchin would\r\nhave been stranded on its flank: but I nowhere observed these rocks\r\nto be of so fine a granite as I believe the upper rocks of Kinchin to\r\nbe, and I consequently cannot advance even that far-fetched solution\r\nwith much plausibility.\r\n\r\nAs I ascended, the rocks became more granitic, with large crystals of\r\nmica. The summit was another broad bare flat, elevated 13,080 feet,\r\nand fringed by a copse of rose, berberry, and very alpine\r\nrhododendrons: the Himalayan heather (_Adromeda fastigiata_) grew\r\nabundantly here, affording us good fuel.\r\n\r\nThe toilsome ascent through the soft snow and brushwood delayed the\r\ncoolies, who scarcely accomplished five miles in the day. Some of\r\nthem having come up by dark, I prepared to camp on the mountain-top,\r\nstrewing thick masses of _Andromeda_ and moss (which latter hung in\r\ngreat tufts from the bushes) on the snow; my blankets bad not\r\narrived, but there was no prospect of a snow-storm.\r\n\r\nThe sun was powerful when I reached the summit, and I was so warm\r\nthat I walked about barefoot on the frozen snow without\r\ninconvenience, preferring it to continuing in wet stockings: the\r\ntemperature at the time was 29.5 degrees, with a brisk south-east\r\nmoist wind, and the dew point 22.8 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe night was magnificent, brilliant starlight, with a pale mist over\r\nthe mountains: the thermometer fell to 15.5 degrees at 7.30 p.m., and\r\none laid upon wood with its bulb freely exposed, sank to 7.5 degrees:\r\nthe snow sparkled with broad  flakes of hoar-frost in the full moon,\r\nwhich was so bright, that I recorded my observations by its light.\r\nOwing to the extreme cold of radiation, I passed a very uncomfortable\r\nnight. The minimum thermometer fell to 1 degrees in shade.* [At\r\nsunrise the temperature was 11.5 degrees; that of grass, cleared on\r\nthe previous day from snow, and exposed to the sky, 6.5 degrees; that\r\non wool, 2.2 degrees; and that on the surface of the snow, 0.7\r\ndegrees.]  The sky was clear; and every rock, leaf, twig, blade of\r\ngrass, and the snow itself, were covered with broad rhomboidal plates\r\nof hoar-frost, nearly one-third of an inch across: while the metal\r\nscale of the thermometer instantaneously blistered my tongue. As the\r\nsun rose, the light reflected from these myriads of facets had a\r\nsplendid effect.\r\n\r\nBefore sunrise the atmosphere was still, and all but cloudless.\r\nTo the south-east were visible the plains of India, at least 140\r\nmiles distant; where, as usual, horizontal layers of leaden purple\r\nvapour obscured the horizon: behind these the sun rose majestically,\r\ninstantly dispersing them, while a thin haze spread over all the\r\nintervening mountains, from its slanting beams reaching me through\r\notherwise imperceptible vapours: these, as the sun mounted higher,\r\nagain became invisible, though still giving that transparency to the\r\natmosphere and brilliant definition of the distances, so\r\ncharacteristic of a damp, yet clear day.\r\n\r\nMon Lepcha commands a most extensive view of Sikkim, southward to\r\nDorjiling. At my feet lay the great and profound valley of the\r\nRatong, a dark gulf of vegetation. Looking northward, the eye\r\nfollowed that river to the summit of Kinchinjunga (distant eighteen\r\nmiles), which fronts the beholder as Mont Blanc does when seen from\r\nthe mountains on the opposite side of the valley of Chamouni. To the\r\neast are the immense precipices and  glaciers of Pundim, and on the\r\nwest those of Kubra, forming great supporters to the stupendous\r\nmountain between them. Mon Lepcha itself is a spur running south-east\r\nfrom the Kubra shoulder: it is very open, and covered with rounded\r\nhills for several miles further north, terminating in a conspicuous\r\nconical black hummock* [This I have beau told is the true Kubra; and\r\nthe great snowy mountain behind it, which I here, in conformity with\r\nthe Dorjiling nomenclature, call Kubra, has no name, being considered\r\na part of Kinchin.] called Gubroo, of 15,000 feet elevation, which\r\npresents a black cliff to the south.\r\n\r\nKinchinjunga rises in three heads, of nearly equal height,* [The\r\neastern and western tops, are respectively 27,826 and 28,177 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea.] which form a line running north-west.\r\nIt exposes many white or grey rocks, bare of snow, and disposed in\r\nstrata* [I am aware that the word strata is inappropriate here; the\r\nappearance of stratification or bedding, if it indicate any structure\r\nof the rock, being, I cannot doubt, due to that action which gives\r\nparallel cleavage planes to granite in many parts of the world, and\r\nto which the so-called lamination or foliation of slate and gneiss is\r\nsupposed by many geologists to be due. It is not usual to find this\r\nstructure so uniformly and conspicuously developed through large\r\nmasses of granite, as it appeared to me to be on the sides of\r\nKinchinjunga and on the top of Junnoo, as seen from the Choonjerma\r\npass (Chapter XI, plate); but it is sometimes very conspicuous, and\r\nnowhere more than in the descent of the Grimsel towards Meyringen,\r\nwhere the granite on the east flank of that magnificent gorge seems\r\ncleft into parallel nearly vertical strata.] sloping to the west; the\r\ncolour of all which above 20,000 feet, and the rounded knobbed form\r\nof the summit, suggest a granitic formation. Lofty snowed ridges\r\nproject from Kubra into the Ratong valley, presenting black\r\nprecipices of stratified rocks to the southward. Pundim has a very\r\ngrand appearance; being eight miles distant, and nearly 9000 feet\r\nabove Mon Lepcha, it subtends an angle of 12 degrees; while Kinchin\r\ntop, though 15,000 feet higher than Mon Lepcha, being eighteen miles\r\ndistant, rises only 9 degrees 30 minutes above the true horizon:\r\nthese angular heights are too small to give much grandeur and\r\napparent elevation to mountains, however lofty; nor would they do so\r\nin this case, were it not that the Ratong valley which intervenes, is\r\nseen to be several thousand feet lower, and many degrees below the\r\nreal horizon.\r\n\r\nIllustration--KINCHINJUNGA AND PUNDIM FROM MON LEPCHA.\r\n\r\nPundim has a tremendous precipice to the south, which, to judge from\r\nits bareness of snow, must be nearly perpendicular; and it presented\r\na superb geological section. The height of this precipice I found by\r\nangles with a pocket sextant to be upwards of 3,400 feet, and that of\r\nits top to be 21,300 above the sea, and consequently only 715 feet\r\nless than that of the summit of Pundim itself (which is 22,015 feet).\r\nThis cliff is of black stratified rocks, sloping to the west, and\r\nprobably striking north-west; permeated from top to bottom by veins\r\nof white granite, disposed in zigzag lines, which produce a\r\ncontortion of the gneiss, and give it a marbled appearance. The same\r\nstructure may be seen in miniature on the transported blocks which\r\nabound in the Sikkim rivers; where veins of finely grained granite\r\nare forced in  all directions through the gneiss, and form parallel\r\nseams or beds between the laminae of that rock, united by transverse\r\nseams, and crumpling up the gneiss itself, like the crushed leaves of\r\na book. The summit of Pundim itself is all of white rock, rounded in\r\nshape, and forming a cap to the gneiss, which weathers into\r\nprecipices.\r\n\r\nA succession of ridges, 14,000 to 18,000 feet high, presented a line\r\nof precipices running south from Pundim for several miles: immense\r\ngranite veins are exposed on their surfaces, and they are capped by\r\nstratified rocks, sloping to the east, and apparently striking to the\r\nnorth-west, which, being black, contrast strongly with the white\r\ngranite beneath them: these ridges, instead of being round-topped,\r\nare broken into splintered crags, behind which rises the beautiful\r\nconical peak of Nursing, 19,139 feet above the sea, eight miles\r\ndistant, and subtending an angle of 8 degrees 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of these precipices was a very conspicuous series of\r\nlofty moraines, round whose bases the Ratong wound; these appeared of\r\nmuch the same height, rising several hundred feet above the valley:\r\nthey were comparatively level-topped, and had steep shelving\r\nrounded sides.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular in describing the upper Ratong valley,\r\nbecause it drains the south face of the loftiest mountain on the\r\nglobe; and I have introduced angular heights, and been precise in my\r\ndetails, because the vagueness with which all terms are usually\r\napplied to the apparent altitude and steepness of mountains and\r\nprecipices, is apt to give false impressions. It is essential to\r\nattend to such points where scenery of real interest and importance\r\nis to be described. It is customary to speak of peaks as towering in\r\nthe air, which yet subtend an angle of very few degrees; of almost\r\nprecipitous ascents,  which, when measured, are found to be slopes of\r\n18 degrees or 20 degrees; and of cliffs as steep and stupendous,\r\nwhich are inclined at a very moderate angle.\r\n\r\nThe effect of perspective is as often to deceive in details as to\r\ngive truth to general impressions; and those accessories are\r\nsometimes wanting in nature, which, when supplied by art, give truth\r\nto the landscape. Thus, a streak of clouds adds height to a peak\r\nwhich should appear lofty, but which scarcely rises above the true\r\nhorizon; and a belt of mist will sunder two snowy mountains which,\r\nthough at very different distances, for want of a play of light and\r\nshade on their dazzling surfaces, and from the extreme transparency\r\nof the air in lofty regions, appear to be at the same distance from\r\nthe observer.\r\n\r\nThe view to the southward from Mon Lepcha, including the country\r\nbetween the sea-like plains of India and the loftiest mountain on the\r\nglobe, is very grand, and neither wanting in variety nor in beauty.\r\nFrom the deep valleys choked with tropical luxuriance to the scanty\r\nyak pasturage on the heights above, seems but a step at the first\r\n_coup-d'oceil,_ but resolves itself on a closer inspection into five\r\nbelts: 1, palm and plantain; 2, oak and laurel; 3, pine;\r\n4, rhododendron and grass; and 5, rock and snow. From the bed of the\r\nRatong, in which grow palms with screw-pine and plantain, it is only\r\nseven miles in a direct line to the perpetual ice. From the plains of\r\nIndia, or outer Himalaya, one may behold snowy peaks rise in the\r\ndistance behind a foreground of tropical forest; here, on the\r\ncontrary, all the intermediate phases of vegetation are seen at a\r\nglance. Except in the Himalaya this is no common phenomenon, and is\r\nowing to the very remarkable depth of the river-beds. That part of\r\nthe valley of the Ratong where tropical vegetation ceases, is but\r\n4000  feet above the sea, and though fully fifty miles as the crow\r\nflies (and perhaps 200 by the windings of the river) from the plains\r\nof India, is only eight in a straight line (and forty by the\r\nwindings) from the snows which feed that river. In other words, the\r\ndescent is so rapid, that in eight miles the Ratong waters every\r\nvariety of vegetation, from the lichen of the poles to the palm of\r\nthe tropics; whilst throughout the remainder of its mountain course,\r\nit falls from 4000 to 300 feet, flowing amongst tropical scenery,\r\nthrough a valley whose flanks rise from 5000 to 12,000 feet above\r\nits bed.\r\n\r\nFrom Mon Lepcha we proceeded north-west towards Jongri, along a very\r\nopen rounded bare mountain, covered with enormous boulders of gneiss,\r\nof which the subjacent rock is also composed. The soil is a thick\r\nclay full of angular stones, everywhere scooped out into little\r\ndepressions which are the dry beds of pools, and are often strewed\r\nwith a thin layer of pebbles. Black tufts of alpine aromatic\r\nrhododendrons of two kinds (_R. anthopogon_ and _setosum_), with\r\ndwarf juniper, comprised all the conspicuous vegetation at\r\nthis season.\r\n\r\nAfter a two hours' walk, keeping at 13,000 feet elevation, we sighted\r\nJongri.* [I am assured by Capt. Sherwill, who, in 1852, proceeded\r\nalong and surveyed the Nepal frontier beyond this point to Gubroo,\r\nthat this is not Jongri, but Yangpoong. The difficulty of getting\r\nprecise information, especially as to the names of seldom-visited\r\nspots, is very great. I was often deceived myself, undesignedly, I am\r\nsure, on the part of my informants; but in this case I have Dr.\r\nCampbell's assurance, who has kindly investigated the subject, that\r\nthere is no mistake on my part. Captain Sherwill has also kindly\r\ncommunicated to me a map of the head waters of the Rungbee, Yungya,\r\nand Yalloong rivers, of which, being more correct than my own, I have\r\ngladly availed myself for my map. Gubroo, he informs me, is 15,000\r\nfeet in altitude, and dips in a precipice 1000 feet high, facing\r\nKubra, which prevented his exploring further north.] There were two\r\nstone huts on the bleak face of the spur, scarcely distinguishable at\r\nthe distance of half a mile from the great blocks around them.\r\nTo the north Gubroo rose in dismal grandeur, backed by the dazzling\r\nsnows of Kubra, which now seemed quite near, its lofty top (alt.\r\n24,005 feet) being only eight miles distant. Much snow lay on the\r\nground in patches, and there were few remains of herbaceous\r\nvegetation; those I recognised were chiefly of poppy, _Potentilla,_\r\ngentian, geranium, fritillary, _Umbelliferae,_ grass, and sedges.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at the huts the weather was still fine, with a strong\r\nnorth-west wind, which meeting the warm moist current from the Ratong\r\nvalley, caused much precipitation of vapour. As I hoped to be able to\r\nvisit the surrounding glaciers from this spot, I made arrangements\r\nfor a stay of some days: giving up the only habitable hut to my\r\npeople, I spread my blankets in a slope from its roof to the ground,\r\nbuilding a little stone dyke round the skirts of my dwelling, and a\r\nfire-place in front.\r\n\r\nHence to Yalloong in Nepal, by the Kanglanamo pass, is two days'\r\nmarch: the route crosses the Singalelah range at an elevation of\r\nabout 15,000 feet, south of Kubra, and north of a mountain that forms\r\na conspicuous feature south-west from Jongri, as a crest of black\r\nfingered peaks, tipped with snow.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to conceive the amount of labour expended upon every\r\npound of salt imported into this part of Sikkim from Tibet, and as an\r\nenumeration of the chief features of the routes it must follow, will\r\ngive some idea of what the circuit of the loftiest mountain in the\r\nglobe involves, I shall briefly allude to them; premising that the\r\ncircuit of Mont Blanc may be easily accomplished in four days.\r\nThe shortest route to Yoksun (the first village south of Kinchin)\r\nfrom the nearest Tibetan village north of that mountain, involves a\r\ndetour of one-third of the  circumference of Kinchin. It is evident\r\nthat the most direct way must be that nearest the mountain-top, and\r\ntherefore that which reaches the highest accessible elevation on its\r\nshoulders, and which, at the same time, dips into the shallowest\r\nvalleys between those shoulders. The actual distance in a straight\r\nline is about fifty miles, from Yoksun to the mart at or near\r\nTashirukpa.\r\n\r\nThe marches between them are as follows:--\r\n  1. To Yalloong two days; crossing Kanglanamo pass, 15,000 feet high.\r\n  3. To foot of Choonjerma pass, descending to 10,000 feet.\r\n  4. Cross Choonjerma pass, 15,260 feet, and proceed to Kambachen,\r\n     11,400 feet.\r\n  5. Cross Nango pass, 15,770, and camp on Yangma river, 11,000 feet.\r\n  6. Ascend to foot of Kanglachem pass, and camp at 15,000 feet.\r\n  7. Cross Kanglachem pass, probably 16,500 feet; and\r\n  8-10. It is said to be three marches hence to the Tibetan\r\n        custom-house, and that two more snowy passes are crossed.\r\n\r\nThis allows no day of rest, and gives only five miles--as the crow\r\nflies--to be accomplished each day, but I assume fully fourteen of\r\nroad distance; the labour spent in which would accomplish fully\r\nthirty over good roads. Four snowed passes at least are crossed, all\r\nabove 15,000 feet, and after the first day the path does not descend\r\nbelow 10,000 feet. By this route about one-third of the circuit of\r\nKinchinjunga is accomplished. Supposing the circuit were to be\r\ncompleted by the shortest practicable route, that is, keeping as near\r\nthe summit as possible, the average time required for a man with his\r\nload would be upwards of a month.\r\n\r\nTo reach Tashirukpa by the eastern route from Yoksun, being a journey\r\nof about twenty-five days, requires a long detour to the southward\r\nand eastward, and afterwards the ascent of the Teesta valley, to\r\nKongra Lama, and so north to the Tibetan Arun.\r\n\r\nMy first operation after encamping and arranging my instruments, was\r\nto sink the ground thermometer; but the earth being frozen for\r\nsixteen inches, it took four men several hours' work with hammer and\r\nchisel, to penetrate so deep. There was much vegetable matter for the\r\nfirst eight or ten inches, and below that a fine red clay. I spent\r\nthe afternoon, which was fine, in botanising. When the sun shone, the\r\nsmell of the two rhododendrons was oppressive, especially as a little\r\nexertion at this elevation brings on headache. There were few mosses;\r\nbut crustaceous lichens were numerous, and nearly all of them of\r\nScotch, Alpine, European, and Arctic kinds. The names of these, given\r\nby the classical Linnaeus and Wahlenberg, tell in some cases of their\r\nbirth-places, in others of their hardihood, their lurid colours and\r\nweather-beaten aspects; such as _tristis, gelida, glacialis, arctica,\r\nalpina, saxatilis, polaris, frigida,_ and numerous others equally\r\nfamiliar to the Scotch botanist. I recognised many as natives of the\r\nwild mountains of Cape Horn, and the rocks of the stormy Antarctic\r\nocean; since visiting which regions I had not gathered them.\r\nThe lichen called _geographicus_ was most abundant, and is found to\r\nindicate a certain degree of cold in every latitude; descending to\r\nthe level of the sea in latitude 52 degrees north, and 50 degrees\r\nsouth, but in lower latitudes only to be seen on mountains.\r\nIt flourishes at 10,000 feet on the Himalaya, ascending thence to\r\n18,000 feet. Its name, however, was not intended to indicate its wide\r\nrange, but the curious  maplike patterns which its yellow crust forms\r\non the rocks.\r\n\r\nOf the blocks of gneiss scattered over the Jongri spur, many are\r\ntwenty feet in diameter. The ridge slopes gently south-west to the\r\nChoroong river, and more steeply north-east to the Ratong, facing\r\nKinchin: it rises so very gradually to a peaked mountain between\r\nJongri and Kubra, that it is not possible to account for the\r\ntransport and deposit of these boulders by glaciers of the ordinary\r\nform, viz., by a stream of ice following the course of a valley; and\r\nwe are forced to speculate upon the possibility of ice having capped\r\nthe whole spur, and moved downwards, transporting blocks from the\r\nprominences on various parts of the spur.\r\n\r\nThe cutting up of the whole surface of this rounded mountain into\r\nlittle pools, now dry, of all sizes, from ten to about one hundred\r\nyards in circumference, is a very striking phenomenon. The streams\r\nflow in shallow transverse valleys, each passing through a succession\r\nof such pools, accompanying a step-like character of the general\r\nsurface. The beds are stony, becoming more so where they enter the\r\npools, upon several of the larger of which I observed curving ridges\r\nof large stones, radiating outwards on to their beds from either\r\nmargin of the entering stream: more generally large stones were\r\ndeposited opposite every embouchure.\r\n\r\nThis superficial sculpturing must have been a very recent operation;\r\nand the transport of the heavy stones opposite the entrance of the\r\nstreams has been effected by ice, and perhaps by snow; just as the\r\narctic ice strews the shores of the Polar ocean with rocks.\r\n\r\nThe weather had been threatening all day, northern and westerly\r\ncurrents contending aloft with the south-east  trade-wind of Sikkim,\r\nand meeting in strife over the great upper valley of the Ratong.\r\nStately masses of white cumuli wheeled round that gulf of glaciers,\r\npartially dissipating in an occasional snow-storm, but on the whole\r\ngradually accumulating.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival the thermometer was 32 degrees, with a powerful sun\r\nshining, and it fell to 28 degrees at 4 p.m., when the north wind set\r\nin. At sunset the moon rose through angry masses of woolly cirrus;\r\nits broad full orb threw a flood of yellow light over the serried\r\ntops south of Pundim; thence advancing obliquely towards Nursing, \"it\r\nstood tip-toe\" for a few minutes on that beautiful pyramid of snow,\r\nwhence it seemed to take flight and mount majestically into mid-air,\r\nilluminating Kinchin, Pundim, and Kubra.\r\n\r\nI sat at the entrance of my gipsy-like hut, anxiously watching the\r\nweather, and absorbed in admiration of the moonrise, from which my\r\nthoughts were soon diverted by its fading light as it entered a dense\r\nmass of mare's-tail cirrus. It was very cold, and the stillness was\r\noppressive. I had been urged not to attempt such an ascent in\r\nJanuary, my provisions were scanty, firewood only to be obtained from\r\nsome distance, the open undulating surface of Jongri was particularly\r\nexposed to heavy snow-drifts, and the path was, at the best, a\r\nscarcely perceptible track. I followed every change of the wind,\r\nevery fluctuation of the barometer and thermometer, each accession of\r\nhumidity, and the courses of the clouds aloft. At 7 p.m., the wind\r\nsuddenly shifted to the west, and the thermometer instantly rose from\r\n20 degrees to 30 degrees. After 8 p.m., the temperature fell again,\r\nand the wind drew round from west by south to north-east, when the\r\nfog cleared off. The barometer rose no more than it usually does\r\ntowards 10 p.m., and though it clouded again, with the temperature at\r\n17 degrees, the wind  seemed steady, and I went to bed with a\r\nrelieved mind.\r\n\r\n_Jan._ 10.--During the night the temperature fell to 11.2 degrees,\r\nand at 6 a.m. was 19.8 degrees, falling again to 17 degrees soon\r\nafter. Though clouds were rapidly coming up from the west and\r\nsouth-west, the wind remained northerly till 8 a.m., when it shifted\r\nto south-west, and the temperature rose to 25 degrees. As it\r\ncontinued fine, with the barometer high, I ventured on a walk towards\r\nGubroo, carefully taking bearings of my position. I found a good many\r\nplants in a rocky valley close to that mountain, which I in vain\r\nattempted to ascend. The air was 30 degrees, with a strong and damp\r\nsouth-west wind, and the cold was so piercing, that two lads who were\r\nwith me, although walking fast, became benumbed, and could not return\r\nwithout assistance. At 11 a.m., a thick fog obliged us to retrace our\r\nsteps: it was followed by snow in soft round pellets like sago, that\r\nswept across the hard ground. During the afternoon it snowed\r\nunceasingly, the wind repeatedly veering round the compass, always\r\nfrom west to east by south, and so by north to west again. The flakes\r\nwere large, soft, and moist with the south wind, and small, hard, and\r\ndry with the north. Glimpses of blue sky were constantly seen to the\r\nsouth, under the gloomy canopy above, but they augured no change.\r\nAs darkness came on, the temperature fell to 15 degrees, and it\r\nsnowed very hard; at 6 p.m., it was 11 degrees, but rose afterwards\r\nto 18 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe night was very cold and wintry: I sat for some hours behind a\r\nblanket screen (which had to be shifted every few minutes) at my\r\ntent-door, keeping up a sulky fire, and peering through the snow for\r\nsigns of improvement, but in vain. The clouds were not dense, for the\r\nmoon's light was distinct, shining on the glittering snow-flakes\r\nthat fell relentlessly: my anxiety was great, and I could not help\r\ncensuring myself severely for exposing a party to so great danger at\r\nsuch a season. I found comfort in the belief that no idle curiosity\r\nhad prompted me, and that with a good motive and a strong prestige of\r\nsuccess, one can surmount a host of difficulties. Still the snow\r\nfell; and my heart sank, as my fire declined, and the flakes\r\nsputtered on the blackening embers; my little puppy, who had\r\ngambolled all day amongst the drifting white pellets, now whined, and\r\ncrouched under my thick woollen cloak; the inconstant searching wind\r\ndrifted the snow into the tent, whose roof so bagged in with the\r\naccumulation that I had to support it with sticks, and dreaded being\r\nsmothered, if the weight should cause it to sink upon my bed during\r\nmy sleep. The increasing cold drove me, however, to my blankets, and\r\ntaking the precaution of stretching a tripod stand over my head, so\r\nas to leave a breathing hole, by supporting the roof if it fell in, I\r\nslept soundly, with my dog at my feet.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise the following morning the sky was clear, with a light\r\nnorth wind; about two feet of snow had fallen, the drifts were deep,\r\nand all trace of the path obliterated. The minimum thermometer had\r\nfallen to 3.7 degrees, the temperature rose to 27 degrees at 9 a.m.,\r\nafter which the wind fell, and with it the thermometer to 18 degrees.\r\nSoon, however, southerly breezes set in, bringing up heavy masses\r\nof clouds.\r\n\r\nMy light-hearted companions cheerfully prepared to leave the ground;\r\nthey took their appointed loads without a murmur, and sought\r\nprotection for their eyes from the glare of the newly fallen snow,\r\nsome with as much of my crape veil as I could spare, others with\r\nshades of brown paper, or of hair from the yaks' tails, whilst a few\r\nhad spectacle-shades of woven hair; and the Lepchas loosened their\r\npigtails, and combed their long hair over their eyes and faces. It is\r\nfrom fresh-fallen snow alone that much inconvenience is felt; owing,\r\nI suppose, to the light reflected from the myriads of facets which\r\nthe crystals of snow present. I have never suffered inconvenience in\r\ncrossing beds of old snow, or glaciers with weathered surfaces, which\r\nabsorb a great deal of light, and reflect comparatively little, and\r\nthat little coloured green or blue.\r\n\r\nThe descent was very laborious, especially through the several miles\r\nof bush and rock which lie below the summit: so that, although we\r\nstarted at 10 a.m., it was dark by the time we reached Buckeem, where\r\nwe found two lame coolies, whom we had left on our way up, and who\r\nwere keeping up a glorious fire for our reception.\r\n\r\nIllustration--MAITRYA, THE SIXTH OR COMING BOODH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nRatong river below Mon Lepcha -- Ferns -- Vegetation of Yoksun,\r\ntropical -- _Araliaceae,_ fodder for cattle -- Rice-paper plant --\r\nGeology of Yoksun -- Lake -- Old temples -- Funereal cypresses --\r\nGigantic chait -- Altars -- Songboom -- Weather -- Catsuperri --\r\nVelocity of Ratong -- Worship at Catsuperri lake -- Scenery -- Willow\r\n-- Lamas and ecclesiastical establishments of Sikkim -- Tengling --\r\nChangachelling temples and monks -- Portrait of myself on walls --\r\nBlock of mica-schist -- Lingcham Kajee asks for spectacles --\r\nHee-hill -- Arrive at Little Rungeet -- At Dorjiling -- Its deserted\r\nand wintry appearance.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we marched to Yoksun: the weather was fair,\r\nthough it was evidently snowing on the mountains above. I halted at\r\nthe Ratong river, at the foot of Mon Lepcha, where I found its\r\nelevation to be 7,150 feet; its edges were frozen, and the\r\ntemperature of the water 36 degrees; it is here a furious torrent\r\nflowing between gneiss rocks which dip south-south-east, and is\r\nflanked by flat-topped beds of boulders, gravel and sand, twelve to\r\nfourteen feet thick. Its vegetation resembles that of Dorjiling, but\r\nis more alpine, owing no doubt to the proximity of Kinchinjunga.\r\nThe magnificent _Rhododendron argenteum_ was growing on its banks.\r\nOn the other hand, I was surprised to see a beautiful fern (a\r\n_Trichomanes,_ very like the Irish one) which is not found at\r\nDorjiling. The same day, at about the same elevation, I gathered\r\nsixty species of fern, many of very tropical forms.* [They consisted\r\nof the above-mentioned _Trichomanes,_ three _Hymenophyllae, Vittaria,\r\nPleopeltis,_ and _Marattia,_ together with several _Selaginellas._]\r\nNo doubt the range of such genera is extended in proportion to the\r\nextreme damp and equable climate, here, as about Dorjiling.\r\nTree-ferns are however absent, and neither plantains, epiphytical\r\n_Orchideae,_ nor palms, are so abundant, or ascend so high as on the\r\nouter ranges. About Yoksun itself, which occupies a very warm\r\nsheltered flat, many tropical genera occur, such as tall bamboos of\r\ntwo kinds, grasses allied to the sugar-cane, scarlet _Erythrina,_ and\r\nvarious _Araliaceae,_ amongst which was one species whose pith was of\r\nso curious a structure, that I had no hesitation in considering the\r\nthen unknown Chinese substance called rice-paper to belong to a\r\nclosely allied plant.* [The Chinese rice-paper has long been known to\r\nbe cut from cylinders of pith which has always a central hollow\r\nchamber, divided into compartments by septa or excessively thin\r\nplates. It is only within the last few months that my supposition has\r\nbeen confirmed, by my father's receiving from China, after many years\r\nof correspondence, specimens of the rice-paper plant itself, which\r\nvery closely resemble, in botanical characters, as well as in outward\r\nappearance of size and habit, the Sikkim plant.]\r\n\r\nThe natives collect the leaves of many Aralias as fodder for cattle,\r\nfor which purpose they are of the greatest service in a country where\r\ngrass for pasture is so scarce; this is the more remarkable, since\r\nthey belong to the natural family of ivy, which is usually poisonous;\r\nthe use of this food, however, gives a peculiar taste to the butter.\r\nIn other parts of Sikkim, fig-leaves are used for the same purpose,\r\nand branches of a bird-cherry (_Prunus_), a plant also of a very\r\npoisonous family, abounding in prussic acid.\r\n\r\nWe were received with great kindness by the villagers of Yoksun, who\r\nhad awaited our return with some anxiety, and on hearing of our\r\napproach had collected large supplies of food; amongst other things\r\nwere tares (called by the Lepchas \"Kullai\"), yams (\"Book\"), and a\r\nbread made by bruising together damp maize and rice into tough thin\r\ncakes (\"Ketch-ung tapha\"). The Lamas of Doobdi were especially civil,\r\nhaving a favour to ask, which was that I would intercede with\r\nDr. Campbell to procure the permission of the Nepalese to reopen the\r\nKanglanamo pass, and thus give some occupation to their herds of\r\nyaks, which were now wandering idly about.\r\n\r\nI botanized for two days on the Yoksun flat, searching for evidence\r\nof lacustrine strata or moraines, being more than ever convinced by\r\nthe views I had obtained of this place from Mon Lepcha, that its\r\nuniformity of surface was due to water action. It is certainly the\r\nmost level area of its size that I know of in Sikkim, though situated\r\nin one of the deepest valleys, and surrounded on almost all sides by\r\nvery steep mountains; and it is far above the flat gravel terraces of\r\nthe present river-beds. I searched the surface of the flat for gravel\r\nbeds in vain, for though it abounds in depressions that must have\r\nformerly been lake-beds, and are now marshes in the rainy season,\r\nthese were all floored with clay. Along the western edge, where the\r\ndescent is very steep for 1800 feet to the Ratong, I found no traces\r\nof stratified deposits, though the spurs which projected from it were\r\noften flattened at top. The only existing lake has sloping clay\r\nbanks, covered with spongy vegetable mould; it has no permanent\r\naffluent or outlet, its present drainage being subterranean, or more\r\nprobably by evaporation; but there is an old water-channel several\r\nfeet above its level. It is eighty to a hundred yards across, and\r\nnearly circular; its depth three or four feet, increased to fifteen\r\nor sixteen in the rains; like all similar pools in Sikkim, it\r\ncontains little or no animal life at this season, and I searched in\r\nvain for shells, insects, or frogs. All around were great blocks of\r\ngneiss, some fully twelve feet square.\r\n\r\nThe situation of this lake is very romantic, buried in a tall forest\r\nof oaks and laurels, and fringed by wild camellia shrubs; the latter\r\nare not the leafy, deep green, large-blossomed plants of our\r\ngreenhouses, but twiggy bushes with small scattered leaves, and\r\nlittle yellowish flowers like those of the tea-plant. The massive\r\nwalls of a ruined temple rise close to the water, which looks like\r\nthe still moat of a castle: beside it are some grand old funereal\r\ncypresses, with ragged scattered branches below, where they struggle\r\nfor light in the dense forest, but raising their heads aloft as\r\nbright green pyramids.\r\n\r\nIllustration--ALTAR AND SONG-BOOM AT YOKSUN.\r\n\r\nAfter some difficulty I found the remains of a broad path that\r\ndivided into two; one of them led to a second ruined temple, fully a\r\nmile off, and the other I followed to a grove, in which was a\r\ngigantic chait; it was a beautiful lane throughout, bordered with\r\nbamboo, brambles, gay-flowered _Melastomaceae_ like hedge-roses, and\r\nscarlet _Erythrina_: there were many old mendongs and chaits on the\r\nway, which I was always careful to leave on the right hand in\r\npassing, such being the rule among Boodhists, the same which ordains\r\nthat the praying-cylinder or \"Mani\" be made to revolve in a direction\r\nagainst the sun's motion.\r\n\r\nThis great chait is the largest in Sikkim; it is called \"Nirbogong,\"\r\nand appears to be fully forty feet high; facing it is a stone altar\r\nabout fifteen feet long and four broad, and behind this again is a\r\nvery curious erection called \"Song-boom,\" used for burning juniper as\r\nincense; it resembles a small smelting furnace, and consists of an\r\nelongated conical stone building eight feet high, raised on a single\r\nblock; it is hollow, and divided into three stories or chambers; in\r\nthe lower of which is a door, by which fuel is placed inside, and the\r\nsmoke ascending through holes in the upper slabs, escapes by lateral\r\nopenings from the top compartment. These structures are said to be\r\ncommon in Tibet, but I saw no other in Sikkim.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Yoksun, the weather was very cold, especially at\r\nnight, considering the elevation (5,600 feet): the mean temperature\r\nwas 39 degrees, the extremes being 19.2 degrees and 60 degrees; and\r\neven at 8 a.m. the thermometer, laid on the frosty grass, stood at 20\r\ndegrees; temperatures which are rare at Dorjiling, 1500 feet higher.\r\nI could not but regard with surprise such half tropical genera as\r\nperennial-leaved vines, _Saccharum, Erythrina,_ large bamboos,\r\n_Osbeckia_ and cultivated millet, resisting such low temperatures.*\r\n[This is no doubt due to the temperature of the soil being always\r\nhigh: I did not sink a thermometer at Yoksun, but from observations\r\ntaken at similar elevations, the temperature of the earth, at three\r\nfeet depth, may be assumed to be 55 degrees.]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th January I left Yoksun for the lake and temples of\r\nCatsuperri, the former of which is by much the largest in Sikkim.\r\nAfter a steep descent of 1800 feet, we reached the Ratong, where its\r\nbed is only 3,790 feet above the sea; it is here a turbulent stream,\r\ntwelve yards across, with the usual features of gravel terraces, huge\r\nboulders of gneiss and some of the same rock _in situ,_ striking\r\nnorth-east. Some idea of its velocity may be formed from the descent\r\nit makes from the foot of Mon Lepcha, where the elevation of its bed\r\nwas 7,150 feet, giving a fall of 3,350 feet in only ten miles.\r\n\r\nHence I ascended a very steep spur, through tropical vegetation, now\r\nbecome so familiar to me that I used to count the number of species\r\nbelonging to the different large natural orders, as I went along.\r\nI gathered only thirty-five ferns at these low elevations, in the\r\nsame space as produces from fifty to sixty in the more equable and\r\nhumid regions of 6000 feet; grasses on the other hand were much more\r\nnumerous. The view of the flat of Yoksun from Lungschung village,\r\nopposite to it, and on about the same level, is curious; as is that\r\nof the hamlet of Lathiang on the same side, which I have before\r\nnoticed as being placed on a very singular flat shelf above the\r\nRatong, and is overhung by rocks.\r\n\r\nAscending very steeply for several thousand feet, we reached a hollow\r\non the Catsuperri spur, beyond which the lake lies buried in a deep\r\nforest. A Lama from the adjacent temple accompanied us, and I found\r\nmy people affecting great solemnity as they approached its sacred\r\nbounds; they incessantly muttered \"Om mani,\" etc., kotowed to trees\r\nand stones, and hung bits of rag on the bushes. A pretence of\r\nopposing our progress was made by the priest, who of course wanted\r\nmoney; this I did not appear to notice, and after a steep descent, we\r\nwere soon on the shores of what is, for Sikkim, a grand sheet of\r\nwater, (6,040 feet above the sea), without any apparent outlet: it\r\nmay be from three to five hundred yards across in the rains, but was\r\nmuch less now, and was bordered by a broad marsh of bog moss\r\n(_Sphagnum_), in which were abundance of _Azolla,_ colouring the\r\nwaters red, and sedges. Along the banks were bushes of _Rhododendron\r\nbarbatum_ and _Berberis insignis,_* [This magnificent new species has\r\nnot been introduced into England; it forms a large bush, with\r\ndeep-green leaves seven inches long, and bunches of yellow flowers.]\r\nbut the mass of the vegetation was similar to that of Dorjiling.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the marsh to the edge of the lake by a rude paved way of\r\ndecaying logs, through which we often plunged up to our knees.\r\nThe Lama had come provided with a piece of bark, shaped like a boat,\r\nsome juniper incense and a match-box, with which he made a fire, and\r\nput it in the boat, which he then launched on the lake as a votive\r\noffering to the presiding deity. It was a dead calm, but the impetus\r\nhe gave to the bark shot it far across the lake, whose surface was\r\nsoon covered with a thick cloud of white smoke. Taking a rupee from\r\nme, the priest then waved his arm aloft, and pretended to throw the\r\nmoney into the water, singing snatches of prayers in Tibetan, and at\r\ntimes shrieking at the top of his voice to the Dryad who claims these\r\nwoods and waters as his own. There was neither bird, beast, nor\r\ninsect to be seen, and the scenery was as impressive to me, as the\r\neffect of the simple service was upon my people, who prayed with\r\nredoubled fervour, and hung more rags on the bushes.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that this invocation of the gods of the woods and\r\nwaters forms no part of Lama worship; but the Lepchas are but half\r\nBoodhists; in their hearts they dread the demons of the grove, the\r\nlake, the snowy mountain and the torrent, and the crafty Lama takes\r\nadvantage of this, modifies his practices to suit their requirements,\r\nand is content with the formal recognition of the spiritual supremacy\r\nof the church. This is most remarkably shown in their acknowledgment\r\nof the day on which offerings had been made from time immemorial by\r\nthe pagan Lepchas to the genius of Kinchinjunga, by holding it as a\r\nfestival of the church throughout Sikkim.* [On that occasion an\r\ninvocation to the mountain is chanted by priests and people in\r\nchorus. Like the Lama's address to the genius of Catsuperri lake, its\r\nmeaning, if it ever had any, is not now apparent. It runs thus:--\r\n            \"Kanchin-jinga, Pemi Kadup\r\n             Gnetche Tangla, Dursha tember\r\n             Zu jinga Pemsum Serkiem\r\n             Dischze Kubra Kanchin tong.\"\r\nThis was written for me by Dr. Campbell, who, like myself, has vainly\r\nsought its solution; it is probably a mixture of Tibetan and Lepcha,\r\nboth as much corrupted as the celebrated \"Om mani padmi boom,\" which\r\nis universally pronounced by Lepchas \"Menny pemmy boom.\" This reminds\r\nme that I never got a solution of this sentence from a Lama, of\r\nwhatever rank or learning; and it was only after incessant inquiry,\r\nduring a residence of many years in Nepal, that Mr. Hodgson at last\r\nprocured the interpretation, or rather paraphrase: \"Hail to him\r\n(Sakya) of the lotus and the jewel,\" which is very much the same as\r\nM. Klaproth and other authorities have given.]\r\n\r\nThe two Catsuperri temples occupy a spur 445 feet above the lake, and\r\n6,485 feet above the sea; they are poor, and only remarkable for a\r\nmiserable weeping-willow tree planted near them, said to have been\r\nbrought from Lhassa. The monks were very civil to me, and offered\r\namongst other things a present of excellent honey. One was an\r\nintelligent man, and gave me much information: he told me that there\r\nwere upwards of twenty religious establishments in Sikkim, containing\r\nmore than 1000 priests. These have various claims upon the devout:\r\nthus, Tassiding, Doobdi, Changachelling, and Pemiongchi, are\r\ncelebrated for their antiquity, and the latter also for being the\r\nresidence of the head Lama; Catsuperri for its lake; Raklang for its\r\nsize, etc. All are under one spiritual head, who is the Tupgain Lama,\r\nor eldest son of the Rajah; and who resides at the Phadong convent,\r\nnear Tumloong: the Lama of Pemiongchi is, however, the most highly\r\nrespected, on account of his age, position, and sanctity. Advancement\r\nin the hierarchy is dependent chiefly on interest, but indirectly on\r\nworks also; pilgrimages to Lhassa and Teshoo Loombo are the highest\r\nof these, and it is clearly the interest of the supreme pontiffs of\r\nthose ecclesiastical capitals to encourage such, and to intimate to\r\nthe Sikkim authorities, the claims those who perform them have for\r\npreferment. Dispensations for petty offences are granted to Lamas of\r\nlow degree and monks, by those of higher station, but crimes against\r\nthe church are invariably referred to Tibet, and decided there.\r\n\r\nThe election to the Sikkim Lamaseries is generally conducted on the\r\nprinciple of self-government, but Pemiongchi and some others are\r\noften served by Lamas appointed from Tibet, or ordained there, at\r\nsome of the great convents. I never heard of an instance of any\r\nSikkim Lama arriving at such sanctity as to be considered immortal,\r\nand to reappear after death in another individual, nor is there any\r\nelection of infants. All are of the Ningma, Dookpa, or Shammar sect,\r\nand are distinguished by their red mitres; they were once dominant\r\nthroughout Tibet, but after many wars* [The following account of the\r\nearly war between the red and the yellow-mitred Lamas was given me by\r\nTchebu Lama:--For twenty-five generations the red-cape (Dookpa or\r\nNingma) prevailed in Tibet, when they split into two sects, who\r\ncontended for supreme power; the Lama of Phado, who headed the\r\ndissenters, and adopted a yellow mitre, being favoured by the Emperor\r\nof China, to whom reference was made. A persecution of the red Lamas\r\nfollowed, who were caught by the yellow-caps, and their mitres\r\nplunged into dyeing vats kept always ready at the Lamaseries.\r\nThe Dookpa, however, still held Teshoo Loombo, and applied to the\r\nSokpo (North Tibet) Lamas for aid, who bringing horses and camels,\r\neasily prevailed over the Gelookpa or yellow sect, but afterwards\r\ntreacherously went over to them, and joined them in an attack on\r\nTeshoo Loombo, which was plundered and occupied by the Gelookpas.\r\nThe Dookpa thereafter took refuge in Sikkim and Bhotan, whence the\r\nBhotan Rajah became their spiritual chief under the name of Dhurma\r\nRajah, and is now the representative of that creed. Goorucknath is\r\nstill the Dookpa's favourite spiritual deity of the older creed,\r\nwhich is, however, no longer in the ascendant. The Dalai Lama of\r\nTeshoo Loombo is a Gelookpa, as is the Rimbochay Lama, and the Potala\r\nLama of Lhassa, according to Tchebu Lama, but Turner (\"Travels in\r\nTibet,\" p. 315) says the contrary; the Gelookpa consider Sakya Thoba\r\n(or Tsongkaba) alias Mahamouni, as their great avatar.] with the\r\nyellow-caps, they were driven from that country, and took refuge\r\nprincipally in the Himalaya. The Bhotan or Dhurma* [Bhotan is\r\ngenerally known as the Dhurma country. See note, Chapter V.] Rajah\r\nbecame the spiritual head of this sect, and, as is well known,\r\ndisputes the temporal government also of his country with the Deva\r\nRajah, who is the hereditary temporal monarch, and never claims\r\nspiritual jurisdiction. I am indebted to Dr. Campbell for a copy and\r\ntranslation of the Dhurma Rajah's great seal, containing the\r\nattributes of his spirituality, a copy of which I have appended to\r\nthe end of this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe internal organisation of the different monastic establishments is\r\nvery simple. The head or Teshoo Lama* [I have been informed by\r\nletters from Dr. Campbell that the Pemiongchi Lama is about to remove\r\nthe religious capital of Sikkim to Dorjiling, and build there a grand\r\ntemple and monastery; this will be attractive to visitors, and afford\r\nthe means of extending our knowledge of East Tibet.] rules supreme;\r\nthen come the monks and various orders of priests, and then those who\r\nare candidates for orders, and dependents, both lay-brothers and\r\nslaves: there are a few nunneries in Sikkim, and the nuns are all\r\nrelatives or connections of the Rajah, his sister is amongst them.\r\nDuring the greater part of the year, all lead a more or less idle\r\nlife; the dependents being the most occupied in carrying wood and\r\nwater, cultivating the land, etc.\r\n\r\nThe lay-brothers are often skilful workmen, and are sometimes lent or\r\nhired out as labourers, especially as housebuilders and decorators.\r\nNo tax of any kind is levied on the church, which is frequently very\r\nrich in land, flocks, and herds, and in contributions from the\r\npeople: land is sometimes granted by the Rajah, but is oftener\r\npurchased by the priests, or willed, or given by the proprietor.\r\nThe services, to which I have already alluded, are very irregularly\r\nperformed; in most temples only on festival days, which correspond to\r\nthe Tibetan ones so admirably described in MM. Huc and Gabet's\r\nnarrative; in a few, however, service is performed daily, especially\r\nin such as stand near frequented roads, and hence reap the\r\nrichest harvest.\r\n\r\nLike all the natives of Tibet and Sikkim, the priests are intolerably\r\nfilthy; in some cases so far carrying out their doctrines as not even\r\nto kill the vermin with which they swarm. All are nominally bound to\r\nchastity, but exemptions in favour of Lamas of wealth, rank, or\r\npower, are granted by the supreme pontiffs, both in Tibet and Sikkim.\r\nI constantly found swarms of children about the Lamaseries, who were\r\ninvariably called nephews and nieces.\r\n\r\nDescending from the Catsuperri temples, I encamped at the village of\r\nTengling (elevation 5,257 feet), where I was waited upon by a bevy of\r\nforty women, Lepchas and Sikkim Bhoteeas, accompanied by their\r\nchildren, and bringing presents of fowls, rice and vegetables, and\r\napologising for the absence of their male relatives, who were gone to\r\ncarry tribute to the Rajah. Thence I marched to Changachelling, first\r\ndescending to the Tengling river, which divides the Catsuperri from\r\nthe Molli ridge, and which I crossed.\r\n\r\nTree-ferns here advance further north than in any other part of\r\nSikkim. I did not visit the Molli temples, but crossed the spur of\r\nthat name, to the Rungbee river, whose bed is 3,300 feet above the\r\nsea; thence I ascended upwards of 3,500 feet to the Changachelling\r\ntemples, passing Tchongpong village. The ridge on which both\r\nPemiongchi and Changachelling are built, is excessively narrow at\r\ntop; it is traversed by a \"via Sacra,\" connecting these two\r\nestablishments; this is a pretty wooded walk, passing mendongs and\r\nchaits hoary with lichens and mosses; to the north the snows of\r\nKinchinjunga are seen glimmering between the trunks of oaks, laurels,\r\nand rhododendrons, while to the south the Sinchul and Dorjiling spurs\r\nshut out the view of the plains of India.\r\n\r\nChangachelling temples and chaits crown a beautiful rocky eminence on\r\nthe ridge, their roofs, cones and spires peeping through groves of\r\nbamboo, rhododendrons, and arbutus; the ascent is by broad flights of\r\nsteps cut in the mica-slate rocks, up which shaven and girdled monks,\r\nwith rosaries and long red gowns, were dragging loads of bamboo\r\nstems, that produced a curious rattling noise. At the summit there is\r\na fine temple, with the ruins of several others, and of many houses:\r\nthe greater part of the principal temple, which is two-storied and\r\ndivided into several compartments, is occupied by families. The monks\r\nwere busy repairing the part devoted to worship, which consists of a\r\nlarge chamber and vestibule of the usual form: the outside walls are\r\ndaubed red, with a pigment of burnt felspathic clay, which is dug\r\nhard by. Some were painting the vestibule with colours brought from\r\nLhassa, where they had been trained to the art. Amongst other figures\r\nwas one playing on a guitar, a very common symbol in the vestibules\r\nof Sikkim temples: I also saw an angel playing on the flute, and a\r\nsnake-king offering fruit to a figure in the water, who was grasping\r\na serpent. Amongst the figures I was struck by that of an Englishman,\r\nwhom, to my amusement, and the limner's great delight, I recognised\r\nas myself. I was depicted in a flowered silk coat instead of a tartan\r\nshooting jacket, my shoes were turned up at the toes, and I had on\r\nspectacles and a tartar cap, and was writing notes in a book. On one\r\nside a snake-king was politely handing me fruit, and on the other a\r\nhorrible demon was writhing.\r\n\r\nA crowd had collected to see whether I should recognise myself, and\r\nwhen I did so, the merriment was extreme. They begged me to send them\r\na supply of vermilion, goldleaf, and brushes; our so called\r\ncamel's-hair pencils being much superior to theirs, which are made of\r\nmarmot's hair.\r\n\r\nI was then conducted to a house, where I found salted and buttered\r\ntea and Murwa beer smoking in hospitable preparation. As usual, the\r\nhouse was of wood, and the inhabited apartments above the low\r\nbasement story were approached by an outside ladder, like a Swiss\r\ncottage: within were two rooms floored with earth; the inner was\r\nsmall, and opened on a verandah that faced Kinchinjunga, whence the\r\nkeen wind whistled through the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe head Lama, my jolly fat friend of the 20th of December, came to\r\nbreakfast with me, followed by several children, nephews and nieces\r\nhe said; but they were uncommonly like him for such a distant\r\nrelationship, and he seemed extremely fond of them, and much pleased\r\nwhen I stuffed them with sugar.\r\n\r\nChangachelling hill is remarkable for having on its summit an immense\r\ntabular mass of chlorite slate, resting apparently horizontally on\r\nvariously inclined rocks of the same: it is quite flat-topped, ten to\r\ntwelve yards each way, and the sides are squared by art; the country\r\npeople attribute its presence here to a miracle.\r\n\r\nThe view of the Kinchin range from this spot being one of the finest\r\nin Sikkim, and the place itself being visible from Dorjiling, I took\r\na very careful series of bearings, which, with those obtained at\r\nPemiongchi, were of the utmost use in improving my map, which was\r\ngradually progressing. To my disappointment I found that neither\r\npriest nor people knew the name of a single snowy mountain. I also\r\nasked in vain for some interpretation of the lines I have quoted at\r\nearlier; they said they were Lepcha worship, and that they only used\r\nthem for the gratification of the people, on the day of the great\r\nfestival of Kinchinjunga.\r\n\r\nHence I descended to the Kulhait river, on my route back to\r\nDorjiling, visiting my very hospitable tippling friend, the Kajee of\r\nLingcham, on the way down: he humbly begged me to get him a pair of\r\nspectacles, for no other object than to look wise, as he had the eyes\r\nof a hawk; he told me that mine drew down universal respect in\r\nSikkim, and that I had been drawn with them on, in the temple at\r\nChangachelling; and that a pair would not only wonderfully become\r\nhim, but afford him the most pleasing recollections of myself.\r\nHappily I had the means of gratifying him, and have since been told\r\nthat he wears them on state occasions.\r\n\r\nI encamped by the river, 3,160 feet above the sea, amongst figs and\r\nplantains, on a broad terrace of pebbles, boulders and sand, ten feet\r\nabove the stream; the rocks in the latter were covered with a red\r\nconferva. The sand on the banks was disposed in layers, alternately\r\nwhite and red, the white being quartz, and the red pulverised\r\ngarnets. The arranging of these sand-bands by the water must be due\r\nto the different specific gravities of the garnet and quartz; the\r\nformer being lighter, is lifted by the current on to the surface of\r\nthe quartz, and left there when the waters retire.\r\n\r\nOn the next day I ascended Hee hill, crossed it at an elevation of\r\n7,290 feet, and camped on the opposite side at 6,680 feet, in a dense\r\nforest. The next march was still southward to the little Rungeet\r\nguard-house, below Dorjiling spur, which I reached after a fatiguing\r\nwalk amidst torrents of rain. The banks of the little Rungeet river,\r\nwhich is only 1,670 feet above the sea, are very flat and low, with\r\nbroad terraces of pebbles and shingle, upon which are huge gneiss\r\nboulders, fully 200 feet above the stream.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of January, I ascended the Tukvor spur to Dorjiling, and\r\nreceived a most hospitable welcome from my friend Mr. Muller, now\r\nalmost the only European inhabitant of the place; Mr. Hodgson having\r\ngone down on a shooting excursion in the Terai, and Dr. Campbell\r\nbeing on duty on the Bhotan frontier. The place looked what it really\r\nwas--wholly deserted. The rain I had experienced in the valley, had\r\nhere been snow, and the appearance of the broad snowed patches clear\r\nof trees, and of the many houses without smoke or inhabitant, and the\r\ntall scattered trees with black bark and all but naked branches, was\r\ndismal in the extreme. The effect was heightened by an occasional\r\nHindoo, who flitted here and there along the road, crouching and\r\nshivering, with white cotton garments and bare legs.\r\n\r\nThe delight of my Lepcha attendants at finding themselves safely at\r\nhome again, knew no bounds; and their parents waited on me with\r\npresents, and other tokens of their goodwill and gratitude. I had no\r\nlack of volunteers for a similar excursion in the following season,\r\nthough with their usual fickleness, more than half failed me, long\r\nbefore the time arrived for putting their zeal to the proof.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Dr. Campbell for the accompanying impression and\r\ndescription of the seal of the Dhurma Rajah, or sovereign pontiff of\r\nBhotan, and spiritual head of the whole sect of the Dookpa, or\r\nred-mitred Lama Boodhists. The translations were made by Aden Tchehu\r\nLama, who accompanied us into Sikkim in 1849, and I believe they are\r\nquite correct. The Tibetan characters run from left to right.\r\n\r\nThe seal of the Dhurma Rajah is divided into a centre portion and\r\nsixteen rays. In the centre is the word Dookyin, which means \"The\r\nDookpa Creed\"; around the \"Dookyin\" are sixteen similar letters,\r\nmeaning \"I,\" or \"I am.\" The sixteen radial compartments contain his\r\ntitles and attributes, thus, commencing from the centre erect one,\r\nand passing round from left to right:--\r\n\r\n1. I am the Spiritual and Temporal Chief of the Realm.\r\n2. The Defender of the Faith.\r\n3. Equal to Saruswati in learning.\r\n4. Chief of all the Boodhs.\r\n5. Head expounder of the Shasters.\r\n6. Caster out of devils.\r\n7. The most learned in the Holy Laws.\r\n8. An Avatar of God (or, by God's will).\r\n9. Absolver of sins.\r\n10. I am above all the Lamas of the Dookpa Creed.\r\n11. I am of the best of all Religions--the Dookpa.\r\n12. The punisher of unbelievers.\r\n18. Unequalled in expounding the Shasters.\r\n14. Unequalled in holiness and wisdom.\r\n15. The head (or fountain) of all Religious Knowledge.\r\n16. The Enemy of all false Avatars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nEXCURSION TO TERAI.\r\n\r\nDispatch collections -- Acorns -- Heat -- Punkabaree -- Bees --\r\nVegetation -- Haze -- Titalya -- Earthquake -- Proceed to Nepal\r\nfrontier -- Terai, geology of -- Physical features of Himalayan\r\nvalleys -- Elephants, purchase of, etc. -- Riverbeds -- Mechi river\r\n-- Return to Titalya -- Leave for Teesta -- Climate of plains --\r\nJeelpigoree -- Cooches -- Alteration in the appearance of country by\r\nfires, etc. -- Grasses -- Bamboos -- Cottages -- Rajah of Cooch Behar\r\n-- Condition of people -- Hooli festival -- Ascend Teesta -- Canoes\r\n-- Cranes -- Forest -- Baikant-pore -- Rummai -- Religion -- Plants\r\nat foot of mountains -- Exit of Teesta -- Canoe voyage down to\r\nRangamally -- English genera of plants -- Birds -- Beautiful Scenery\r\n-- Botanizing on elephants -- Willow -- Siligoree -- Cross Terai --\r\nGeology -- Iron -- Lohar-ghur -- Coal and sandstone beds -- Mechi\r\nfisherman -- Hailstorm -- Ascent to Khersiong -- To Dorjiling --\r\nVegetation -- Geology -- Folded quartz-beds -- Spheres of feldspar --\r\nLime deposits.\r\n\r\nHaving arranged the collections (amounting to eighty loads) made\r\nduring 1848, they were conveyed by coolies to the foot of the hills,\r\nwhere carts were provided to carry them five days' journey to the\r\nMahanuddy river, which flows into the Ganges, whence they were\r\ntransported by water to Calcutta.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of February, I left Dorjiling to join Mr. Hodgson, at\r\nTitalya on the plains. The weather was raw, cold, and threatening:\r\nsnow lay here and there at 7000 feet, and all vegetation was very\r\nbackward, and wore a wintry garb. The laurels, maples, and\r\ndeciduous-leaved oaks, hydrangea and cherry, were leafless, but the\r\nabundance of chesnuts and evergreen oaks, rhododendrons, _Aucuba,\r\nLinonia,_ and other shrubs, kept the forest well clothed. The oaks\r\nhad borne a very unusual number of acorns during  the last season,\r\nwhich were now falling, and strewing the road in some places so\r\nabundantly, that it was hardly safe to ride down hill.\r\n\r\nThe plains of Bengal were all but obscured by a dense haze, partly\r\nowing to a peculiar state of the atmosphere that prevails in the dry\r\nmonths, and partly to the fires raging in the Terai forest, from\r\nwhich white wreaths of smoke ascended, stretching obliquely for miles\r\nto the eastward, and filling the air with black particles of\r\ngrass-stems, carried 4000 feet aloft by the heated ascending currents\r\nthat impinge against the flanks of the mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the tropical region the air was scented with the white blossoms of\r\nthe _Vitex Agnus-castus,_ which grew in profusion by the road-side;\r\nbut the forest, which had looked so gigantic on my arrival at the\r\nmountains the previous year, appeared small after the far more lofty\r\nand bulky oaks and pines of the upper regions of the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nThe evening was sultry and close, the heated surface of the earth\r\nseemed to load the surrounding atmosphere with warm vapours, and the\r\nsensation, as compared with the cool pure air of Dorjiling, was that\r\nof entering a confined tropical harbour after a long sea-voyage.\r\n\r\nI slept in the little bungalow of Punkabaree, and was wakened next\r\nmorning by sounds to which I had long been a stranger, the voices of\r\ninnumerable birds, and the humming of great bees that bore large\r\nholes for their dwellings in the beams and rafters of houses: never\r\nbefore had I been so forcibly struck with the absence of animal life\r\nin the regions of the upper Himalaya.\r\n\r\nBreakfasting early, I pursued my way in the so-called cool of the\r\nmorning, but this was neither bright nor fresh; the night having been\r\nhazy, there had been no terrestrial radiation, and the earth was\r\ndusty and parched; while the  sun rose through a murky yellowish\r\natmosphere with ill-defined orb. Thick clouds of smoke pressed upon\r\nthe plains, and the faint easterly wind wafted large flakes of grass\r\ncharcoal sluggishly through the air.\r\n\r\nVegetation was in great beauty, though past its winter prime. The\r\ntropical forest of India has two flowering seasons; one in summer, of\r\nthe majority of plants; and the other in winter, of _Acanthaceae,\r\nBauhinia, Dillenia, Bombax,_ etc. Of these the former are abundant,\r\nand render the jungle gay with large and delicate white, red, and\r\npurple blossoms. Coarse, ill-favoured vultures wheeled through the\r\nair, languid Bengalees had replaced the active mountaineers,\r\njackal-like curs of low degree teemed at every village, and ran\r\nhowling away from the onslaught of my mountain dog; and the tropics,\r\nwith all their beauty of flower and genial warmth, looked as forbidding\r\nand unwholesome as they felt oppressive to a frame that had so long\r\nbreathed the fresh mountain air.\r\n\r\nMounted on a stout pony, I enjoyed my scamper of sixteen miles over\r\nthe wooded plains and undulating gravelly slopes of the Terai,\r\nintervening between the foot of the mountains and Siligoree bungalow,\r\nwhere I rested for an hour. In the afternoon I rode on leisurely to\r\nTitalya, sixteen miles further, along the banks of the Mahanuddy, the\r\natmosphere being so densely hazy, that objects a few miles off were\r\ninvisible, and the sun quite concealed, though its light was so\r\npowerful that no part of the sky could be steadily gazed upon.\r\nThis state of the air is very curious, and has met with various\r\nattempts at explanation,* [Dr. M'Lelland (\"Calcutta Journal of\r\nNatural History,\" vol. i, p. 52), attributes the haze of the\r\natmosphere during the north-west winds of this season, wholly to\r\nsuspended earthy particles. But the haze is present even in the\r\ncalmest weather, and extreme dryness is in all parts of the world\r\nusually accompanied by an obscure horizon. Captain Campbell\r\n(\"Calcutta Journal of Natural History,\" vol. ii, p. 44.) also objects\r\nto Dr. M'Clelland's theory, citing those parts of Southern India\r\nwhich are least likely to be visited by dust-storms, as possessing an\r\nequally hazy atmosphere; and further denies its being influenced by\r\nthe hygrometric state of the atmosphere.]  all unsatisfactory to me:\r\nit accompanies great heat, dryness, and elasticity of the suspended\r\nvapours, and is not affected by wind. During the afternoon the latter\r\nblew with violence, but being hot and dry, brought no relief to my\r\nstill unacclimated frame. My pony alone enjoyed the freedom of the\r\nboundless plains, and the gallop or trot being fatiguing in the heat,\r\nI tried in vain to keep him at a walk; his spirits did not last long,\r\nhowever, for he flagged after a few days' tropical heat. My little\r\ndog had run thirty miles the day before, exclusive of all the detours\r\nhe had made for his own enjoyment, and he flagged so much after\r\ntwenty more this day, that I had to take him on my saddle-bow, where,\r\nafter licking his hot swollen feet, he fell fast asleep, in spite of\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the wooded Terai at Siligoree, trees became scarce, and\r\nclumps of bamboos were the prevalent features; these, with an\r\noccasional banyan, peepul, or betel-nut palm near the villages, were\r\nthe only breaks on the distant horizon. A powerfully scented\r\n_Clerodendron,_ and an _0sbeckia_ gay with blossoms like dog-roses,\r\nwere abundant; the former especially under trees, where the seeds are\r\ndropped by birds.\r\n\r\nAt Titalya bungalow, I received a hearty welcome from Mr. Hodgson,\r\nand congratulations on the success of my Nepal journey, which\r\nafforded a theme for many conversations.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we had three sharp jerking shocks of an earthquake in\r\nquick succession, at 9.8 p.m., appearing to come up from the\r\nsouthward: they were accompanied by a hollow rumbling sound like that\r\nof a waggon passing over a wooden bridge. The shock was felt strongly\r\nat Dorjiling, and registered by Mr. Muller at 9.10 p.m.: we had\r\naccurately adjusted our watches (chronometers) the previous morning,\r\nand the motion may therefore fairly be assumed to have been\r\ntransmitted northwards through the intervening distance of forty\r\nmiles, in two minutes. Both Mr. Muller and Mr. Hodgson had noted a\r\nmuch more severe shock at 6.10 p.m. the previous evening, which I,\r\nwho was walking down the mountain, did not experience; this caused a\r\ngood deal of damage at Dorjiling, in cracking well-built walls.\r\nEarthquakes are frequent all along the Himalaya, and are felt far in\r\nTibet; they are, however, most common towards the eastern and western\r\nextremities of India; owing in the former case to the proximity of\r\nthe volcanic forces in the bay of Bengal. Cutch and Scinde, as is\r\nwell known, have suffered severely on many occasions, and in several\r\nof them the motion has been propagated through Affghanistan and\r\nLittle Tibet, to the heart of Central Asia.* [See \"Wood's Travels to\r\nthe Oxus.\"]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 1st of March, Dr. Campbell arrived at the\r\nbungalow, from his tour of inspection along the frontier of Bhotan\r\nand the Rungpore district; and we accompanied him hence along the\r\nBritish and Sikkim frontier, as far west as the Mechi river, which\r\nbounds Nepal on the east.\r\n\r\nTerai is a name loosely applied to a tract of country at the very\r\nfoot of the Himalaya: it is Persian, and signifies damp. Politically,\r\nthe Terai generally belongs to the hill-states beyond it;\r\ngeographically, it should appertain to the plains of India; and\r\ngeologically, it is a sort of neutral country, being composed neither\r\nof the alluvium of the plains, nor of the rocks of the hills, but for\r\nthe most part of alternating beds of sand, gravel, and boulders\r\nbrought from the mountains. Botanically it is readily defined as the\r\nregion of forest-trees; amongst which the Sal, the most valuable\r\nof Indian timber, is conspicuous in most parts, though not now in\r\nSikkim, where it has been destroyed. The Terai soil is generally\r\nlight, dry, and gravelly (such as the Sal always prefers), and varies\r\nin breadth, from ten miles, along the Sikkim frontier, to thirty and\r\nmore on the Nepalese. In the latter country it is called the Morung,\r\nand supplies Sal and Sissoo timber for the Calcutta market, the logs\r\nbeing floated down the Konki and Cosi rivers to the Ganges.\r\nThe gravel-beds extend uninterruptedly upon the plains for fully\r\ntwenty miles south of the Sikkim mountains, the gravel becoming\r\nsmaller as the distance increases, and large blocks of stone not\r\nbeing found beyond a few miles from the rocks of the Himalaya itself,\r\neven in the beds of rivers, however large and rapid. Throughout its\r\nbreadth this formation is conspicuously cut into flat-topped\r\nterraces, flanking the spurs of the mountains, at elevations varying\r\nfrom 250 to nearly 1000 feet above the sea. These terraces are of\r\nvarious breadth and length, the smallest lying uppermost, and the\r\nbroadest flanking the rivers below. The isolated hills beyond are\r\nalso flat-topped and terraced. This deposit contains no fossils; and\r\nits general appearance and mineral constituents are the only evidence\r\nof its origin, which is no doubt due to a retiring ocean that washed\r\nthe base of the Sikkim Himalaya, received the contents of its rivers,\r\nand, wearing away its bluff spurs, spread a talus upwards of 1000\r\nfeet thick along its shores. It is not at first sight evident whether\r\nthe terracing is due to periodic retirements of the ocean, or to the\r\nlevelling effects of rivers that have cut channels through the\r\ndeposit. In many places, especially along the banks of the great\r\nstreams, the gravel is smaller, obscurely interstratified with sand,\r\nand the flattened pebbles over-lap rudely, in a manner characteristic\r\nof the effects of running water; but such is  not the case with the\r\nmain body of the deposit, which is unstratified, and much coarser.\r\n\r\nThe alluvium of the Gangetic valley is both interstratified with the\r\ngravel, and passes into it, and was no doubt deposited in deep water,\r\nwhilst the coarser matter* [This, too, is non-fossiliferous, and is\r\nof unknown depth, except at Calcutta, where the sand and clay beds\r\nhave been bored through, to the depth of 120 feet, below which the\r\nfirst pebbles were met with. Whence these pebbles were derived is a\r\ncurious problem. The great Himalayan rivers convey pebbles but a very\r\nfew miles from the mountains on to the plains of India; and there is\r\nno rock _in situ_ above the surface, within many miles of Calcutta,\r\nin any direction.] was accumulating at the foot of the mountains.\r\n\r\nThis view is self-evident, and has occurred, I believe, to almost\r\nevery observer, at whatever part of the base of the Himalaya he may\r\nhave studied this deposit. Its position, above the sandstones of the\r\nSewalik range in the north-west Himalaya, and those of Sikkim, which\r\nappear to be modern fossiliferous rocks, indicates its being\r\ngeologically of recent formation; but it still remains a subject of\r\nthe utmost importance to discover the extent and nature of the ocean\r\nto whose agency it is referred. I have elsewhere remarked that the\r\nalluvium of the Gangetic valley may to a great degree be the measure\r\nof the denudation which the Himalaya has suffered along its Indian\r\nwatershed. It was, no doubt, during the gradual rise of that chain\r\nfrom the ocean, that the gravel and alluvium were deposited; and in\r\nthe terraces and alternation of these, there is evidence that there\r\nhave been many subsidences and elevations of the coast-line, during\r\nwhich the gravel has suffered greatly from denudation.\r\n\r\nI have never looked at the Sikkim Himalaya from the plains without\r\ncomparing its bold spurs enclosing sinuous river gorges, to the\r\nweather-beaten front of a mountainous coast; and in following any of\r\nits great rivers, the scenery  of its deep valleys no less strikingly\r\nresembles that of such narrow arms of the sea (or fiords) as\r\ncharacterize every mountainous coast, of whatever geological\r\nformation: such as the west coast of Scotland and Norway, of South\r\nChili and Fuegia, of New Zealand and Tasmania. There are too in these\r\nHimalayan valleys, at all elevations below 600 feet, terraced\r\npebble-beds, rising in some cases eighty feet above the rivers, which\r\nI believe could only have been deposited by them when they debouched\r\ninto deep water; and both these, and the beds of the rivers, are\r\nstrewed, down to 1000 feet, with masses of rock. Such accumulations\r\nand transported blocks are seen on the raised beaches of our narrow\r\nScottish salt water lochs, exposed by the rising of the land, and\r\nthey are yet forming of immense thickness on many coasts by the joint\r\naction of tides and streams.\r\n\r\nI have described meeting with ancient moraines in every Himalayan\r\nvalley I ascended, at or about 7000 or 8000 feet elevation, proving,\r\nthat at one period, the glaciers descended fully so much below the\r\nposition they now occupy: this can only be explained by a change of\r\nclimate,* [Such a change of temperature, without any depression or\r\nelevation of the mountains, has been thought by Capt. R. Strachey\r\n(\"Journal of Geological Society\"), an able Himalayan observer, to be\r\nthe necessary consequence of an ocean at the foot of these mountains;\r\nfor the amount of perpetual snow, and consequent descent of the\r\nglaciers, increasing indirectly in proportion to the humidity of the\r\nclimate, and the snow-fall, he conjectured that the proximity of the\r\nocean would prodigiously increase such a deposition of snow.--To me,\r\nthis argument appears inconclusive; for the first effect of such a\r\nvast body of water would be to raise the temperature of winter; and\r\nas it is the rain, rather than the sun of summer, which removes the\r\nSikkim snow, so would an increase of this rain elevate, rather than\r\ndepress, the level of perpetual snow.] or by a depression of the\r\nmountain mass equal to 8000 feet, since the formation of these\r\nmoraines.\r\n\r\nThe country about Titalya looks desert, from that want of trees and\r\ncultivation, so characteristic of the upper level throughout this\r\npart of the plains, which is covered with  short, poor pasture-grass.\r\nThe bungalow stands close to the Mahanuddy, on a low hill, cut into\r\nan escarpment twenty feet high, which exposes a section of river-laid\r\nsand and gravel, alternating with thick beds of rounded pebbles.\r\n\r\nShortly after Dr. Campbell's arrival, the meadows about the bungalow\r\npresented a singular appearance, being dotted over with elephants,\r\nbrought for purchase by Government. It was curious to watch the\r\narrival of these enormous animals, which were visible nearly two\r\nmiles across the flat plains; nor less interesting was it to observe\r\nthe wonderful docility of these giants of the animal kingdom, often\r\nonly guided by naked boys, perched on their necks, scolding,\r\nswearing, and enforcing their orders with the iron goad.\r\nThere appeared as many tricks in elephant-dealers as in\r\nhorse-jockeys, and of many animals brought, but few were purchased.\r\nGovernment limits the price to about 75 pounds, and the height to the\r\nshoulder must not be under seven feet, which, incredible as it\r\nappears, may be estimated within a fraction as being three times the\r\ncircumference of the forefoot. The pedigree is closely inquired into,\r\nthe hoofs are examined for cracks, the teeth for age, and many other\r\npoints attended to.\r\n\r\nThe Sikkim frontier, from the Mahanuddy westward to the Mechi, is\r\nmarked out by a row of tall posts. The country is undulating; and\r\nthough fully 400 miles from the ocean, and not sixty from the top of\r\nthe loftiest mountain on the globe, its average level is not 300 feet\r\nabove that of the sea. The upper levels are gravelly, and loosely\r\ncovered with scattered thorny jujube bushes, occasionally tenanted by\r\nthe _Florican,_ which scours these downs like a bustard. Sometimes a\r\nsolitary fig, or a thorny acacia, breaks the horizon, and there are a\r\nfew gnarled trees of the scarlet _Butea frondosa._\r\n\r\nOn our route I had a good opportunity of examining the line of\r\njunction between the alluvial plains that stretch south to the\r\nGanges, and the gravel deposit flanking the hills. The rivers always\r\ncut broad channels with scarped terraced sides, and their low banks\r\nare very fertile, from the mud annually spread by the ever-shifting\r\nstreams that meander within their limits; there are, however, few\r\nshrubs and no trees. The houses, which are very few and scattered,\r\nare built on the gravelly soil above, the lower level being\r\nvery malarious.\r\n\r\nThirty miles south of the mountains, numerous isolated flat-topped\r\nhills, formed of stratified gravel and sand with large water-worn\r\npebbles, rise from 80 to 200 feet above the mean level, which is\r\nabout 250 feet above the sea; these, too, have always scarped sides,\r\nand the channels of small streams completely encircle them.\r\n\r\nAt this season few insects but grasshoppers are to be seen, even\r\nmosquitos being rare. Birds, however, abound, and we noticed the\r\ncommon sparrow, hoopoe, water-wagtail, skylark, osprey, and\r\nseveral egrets.\r\n\r\nWe arrived on the third day at the Mechi river, to the west of which\r\nthe Nepal Terai (or Morung) begins, whose belt of Sal forest loomed\r\non the horizon, so raised by refraction as to be visible as a dark\r\nline, from the distance of many miles. It is, however, very poor, all\r\nthe large trees having been removed. We rode for several miles into\r\nit, and found the soil dry and hard, but supporting a prodigious\r\nundergrowth of gigantic harsh grasses that reached to our heads,\r\nthough we were mounted on elephants. Besides Sal there was abundance\r\nof _Butea, Diospyros, Terminalia,_ and _Symplocos,_ with the dwarf\r\n_Phoenix_ palm, and occasionally _Cycas._ Tigers, wild elephants, and\r\nthe rhinoceros, are said to be found here; but we saw none.\r\n\r\nThe old and new Mechi rivers are several miles apart, but flow in the\r\nsame depression, a low swamp many miles broad, which is grazed at\r\nthis season, and cultivated during the rains. The grass is very rich,\r\npartly owing to the moisture of the climate, and partly to the\r\nretiring waters of the rivers; both circumstances being the effects\r\nof proximity to the Himalaya. Hence cattle (buffalos and the common\r\nhumped cow of India) are driven from the banks of the Ganges 300\r\nmiles to these feeding grounds, for the use of which a trifling tax\r\nis levied on each animal. The cattle are very carelessly herded, and\r\nmany are carried off by tigers.\r\n\r\nHaving returned to Titalya, Mr. Hodgson and I set off in an eastern\r\ndirection for the Teesta river, whose embouchure from the mountains\r\nto the plains I was anxious to visit. Though the weather is hot, and\r\noppressively so in the middle of the day, there are few climates more\r\ndelicious than that of these grassy savannahs from December to March.\r\nWe always started soon after daybreak on ponies, and enjoyed a twelve\r\nto sixteen miles' gallop in the cool of the morning before breakfast,\r\nwhich we found prepared on our arrival at a tent sent on ahead the\r\nnight before. The road led across an open country, or followed paths\r\nthrough interminable rice-fields, now dry and dusty. On poor soil a\r\nwhite-flowered _Leucas_ monopolized the space, like our charlock and\r\npoppy: it was apparently a pest to the agriculturist, covering the\r\nsurface in some places like a sprinkling of snow. Sometimes the\r\nriver-beds exposed fourteen feet of pure stratified sand, with only\r\nan inch of vegetable soil above.\r\n\r\nAt this season the mornings are very hazy, with the thermometer at\r\nsunrise 60 degrees; one laid on grass during the night falling 7\r\ndegrees below that temperature: dew forms,  but never copiously: by\r\n10 a.m. the temperature has risen to 75 degrees, and the faint\r\neasterly morning breezes die away; the haze thickens, and covers the\r\nsky with a white veil, the thermometer rising to 82 degrees at noon,\r\nand the west wind succeeding in parching tornados and furious gusts,\r\nincreasing with the temperature, which attains its maximum in the\r\nafternoon, and falling again with its decline at sunset. The evenings\r\nare calm; but the earth is so heated, that the thermometer stands at\r\n10 p.m. at 66 degrees, and the minimum at night is not below 55\r\ndegrees: great drought accompanies the heat at this season, but not\r\nto such a degree as in North-west India, or other parts of this\r\nmeridian further removed from the hills. In the month of March, and\r\nduring the prevalence of west winds, the mean temperature was 79\r\ndegrees, and the dew-point 22 degrees lower, indicating great\r\ndrought. The temperature at Calcutta was 7 degrees warmer, and the\r\natmosphere very much damper.\r\n\r\nOn the second day we arrived at Jeelpigoree, a large straggling\r\nvillage near the banks of the Teesta, a good way south of the forest:\r\nhere we were detained for several days, waiting for elephants with\r\nwhich to proceed northwards. The natives are Cooches, a Mogul\r\n(Mongolian) race, who inhabit the open country of this district,\r\nreplacing the Mechis of the Terai forest. They are a fine athletic\r\npeople, not very dark, and formed the once-powerful house of Cooch\r\nBehar. Latterly the upper classes have adopted the religion of the\r\nBrahmins, and have had caste conferred upon them; while the lower\r\norders have turned Mahomedans: these, chiefly agriculturists, are a\r\ntimid, oppressed class, who everywhere fled before us, and were with\r\ndifficulty prevailed upon even to direct us along our road. A rude\r\npolice is established by the British Government all over the country,\r\nand to it the traveller applies  for guides and assistance; but the\r\nConches were so shy and difficult to deal with, that we were\r\ngenerally left to our own resources.\r\n\r\nGrass is the prevailing feature of the country, as there are few\r\nshrubs, and still fewer trees. Goats and the common Indian cow are\r\nplentiful; but it is not swampy enough for the buffalo; and sheep are\r\nscarce, on account of the heat of the climate. This uniformity of\r\nfeature over so immense an area is, however, due to the agency of\r\nman, and is of recent introduction; as all concur in affirming, that\r\nwithin the last hundred years the face of the country was covered\r\nwith the same long jungle-grasses which abound in the Terai forest;\r\nand the troops cantoned at Titalya (a central position in these\r\nplains) from 1816 to 1828, confirm this statement as far as their\r\nimmediate neighbourhood is concerned.\r\n\r\nThese gigantic _Gramineae_ seem to be destroyed by fire with\r\nremarkable facility at one season of the year; and it is well that\r\nthis is the case; for, whether as a retainer of miasma, a shelter for\r\nwild beasts, both carnivorous and herbivorous, alike dangerous to\r\nman, or from their liability to ignite, and spread destruction far\r\nand wide, the grass-jungles are most serious obstacles to\r\ncivilization. Next to the rapidity with which it can be cleared, the\r\nadaptation of a great part of the soil to irrigation during the\r\nrains, has greatly aided the bringing of it under cultivation.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater proportion of this universal short turf grass is\r\nformed of _Andropogon acicularis, Cynodon Dactylon,_* [Called \"Dhob.\"\r\nThis is the best pasture grass in the plains of India, and the only\r\none to be found over many thousands of square miles.] and in sandy\r\nplaces, _Imperata cylindrica_;  where the soil is wetter, _Ameletia\r\nIndica_ is abundant, giving a heather-like colour to the turf, with\r\nits pale purple flowers: wherever there is standing water, its\r\nsurface is reddened by the _Azolla,_ and _Salvinia_ is also common.\r\n\r\nAt Jeelpigoree we were waited upon by the Dewan, who governs the\r\ndistrict for the Rajah, a boy about ten years old, whose estates are\r\nlocked up during the trial of an interminable suit for the\r\nsuccession, that has been instituted against him by a natural son of\r\nthe late Rajah: we found the Dewan to be a man of intelligence, who\r\npromised us elephants as soon as the great Hooli festival, now\r\ncommenced, should be over.\r\n\r\nThe large village, at the time of our visit, was gay with holiday\r\ndresses. It is surrounded by trees, chiefly of banyan, jack, mango,\r\npeepul, and tamarind: interminable rice-fields extend on all sides,\r\nand except bananas, slender betel-nut palms, and sometimes pawn, or\r\nbetel-pepper, there is little other extensive cultivation.\r\nThe rose-apple, orange, and pine-apple are rare, as are cocoa-nuts:\r\nthere are few date or fan-palms, and only occasionally poor crops of\r\ncastor-oil and sugar-cane. In the gardens I noticed jasmine,\r\n_Justicia Adhatoda, Hibiscus,_ and others of the very commonest\r\nIndian ornamental plants; while for food were cultivated\r\n_Chenopodium,_ yams, sweet potatos, and more rarely peas, beans, and\r\ngourds. Bamboos were planted round the little properties and smaller\r\nclusters of houses, in oblong squares, the ridge on which the plants\r\ngrew being usually bounded by a shallow ditch. The species selected\r\nwas not the most graceful of its family; the stems, or culms, being\r\ndensely crowded, erect, as thick at the base as the arm, copiously\r\nbranching, and very feathery throughout their whole length of\r\nsixty feet.\r\n\r\nA gay-flowered _Osbeckia_ was common along the roadsides,  and, with\r\na _Clerodendron,_* [_Clerodendron_ leaves, bruised, are used to kill\r\nvermin, fly-blows, etc., in cattle; and the twigs form toothpicks.\r\nThe flowers are presented to Mahadeo, as a god of peace; milk, honey,\r\nflowers, fruit, amrit (ambrosia), etc., being offered to the pacific\r\ngods, as Vishnu, Krishna, etc.; while Mudar (_Asclepias_), Bhang\r\n(_Cannabis sativa_), _Datura,_ flesh, blood, and spirituous liquors,\r\nare offered to Siva, Doorga, Kali, and other demoniacal deities.]\r\nwhose strong, sweet odour was borne far through the air, formed a low\r\nundershrub beneath every tree, generally intermixed with three ferns\r\n(a _Polypodium, Pteris,_ and _Goniopteris_).\r\n\r\nThe cottages are remarkable, and have a very neat appearance,\r\npresenting nothing but a low white-washed platform of clay, and an\r\nenormous high, narrow, black, neatly thatched roof, so arched along\r\nthe ridge, that its eaves nearly touch the ground at each gable; and\r\nlooking at a distance like a gigantic round-backed elephant.\r\nThe walls are of neatly-platted bamboo: each window (of which there\r\nare two) is crossed by slips of bamboo, and wants only glass to make\r\nit look European; they have besides shutters of wattle, that open\r\nupwards, projecting during the day like the port-hatches of a ship,\r\nand let down at night. Within, the rooms are airy and clean: one end\r\ncontains the machans (bedsteads), the others some raised clay\r\nbenches, the fire, frequently an enormous Hookah, round wattled\r\nstools, and various implements. The inhabitants appeared more than\r\nordinarily well-dressed; the men in loose flowing robes of fine\r\ncotton or muslin, the women in the usual garb of a simple thick\r\ncotton cloth, drawn tight immediately above the breast, and thence\r\nfalling perpendicularly to the knee; the colour of this is a bright\r\nblue in stripes, bordered above and below with red.\r\n\r\nI anticipated some novelty from a visit to a Durbar (court) so\r\ndistant from European influence as that of the Rajah of Jeelpigoree.\r\nAll Eastern courts, subject to the Company, are, however, now shorn\r\nof much of their glory;  and the condition of the upper classes is\r\ngreatly changed. Under the Mogul rule, the country was farmed out to\r\nZemindars, some of whom assumed the title of Rajah: they collected\r\nthe revenue for the Sovereign, retaining by law ten per cent. on all\r\nthat was realized: there was no intermediate class, the peasant\r\npaying directly to the Zemindar, and he into the royal treasury.\r\nLatterly the Zemindars have become farmers under the Company's rule;\r\nand in the adjudication of their claims, Lord Cornwallis (then\r\nGovernor-General) made great sacrifices in their favour, levying only\r\na small tribute in proportion to their often great revenues, in the\r\nhope that they would be induced to devote their energies, and some of\r\ntheir means, to the improvement of the condition of the peasantry.\r\nThis expectation was not realized: the younger Zemindars especially,\r\nsubject to no restraint (except from aggressions on their\r\nneighbours), fell into slothful habits, and the collecting of the\r\nrevenue became a trading speculation, entrusted to \"middle men.\"\r\nThe Zemindar selects a number, who again are at liberty to collect\r\nthrough the medium of several sub-renting classes. Hence the peasant\r\nsuffers, and except a generally futile appeal to the Rajah, he has no\r\nredress. The law secures him tenure as long as he can pay his rent,\r\nand to do this he has recourse to the usurer; borrowing in spring (at\r\n50, and oftener 100 per cent.) the seed, plough, and bullocks: he\r\nreaps in autumn, and what is then not required for his own use, is\r\nsold to pay off part of his original debt, the rest standing over\r\ntill the next season; and thus it continues to accumulate, till,\r\noverwhelmed with difficulties, he is ejected, or flees to a\r\nneighbouring district. The Zemindar enjoys the same right of tenure\r\nas the peasant: the amount of impost laid on his property  was fixed\r\nfor perpetuity; whatever his revenue be, he must pay so much to the\r\nCompany, or he forfeits his estates, and they are put up for auction.\r\n\r\nOne evening we visited the young Rajah at his residence, which has\r\nrather a good appearance at a distance, its white walls gleaming\r\nthrough a dark tope of mango, betel, and cocoa-nut. A short rude\r\navenue leads to the entrance gate, under the trees of which a large\r\nbazaar was being held; stocked with cloths, simple utensils,\r\nornaments, sweetmeats, five species of fish from the Teesta, and the\r\nbetel-nut.\r\n\r\nWe entered through a guard-house, where were some of the Rajah's\r\nSepoys in the European costume, and a few of the Company's troops,\r\nlent to the Rajah as a security against some of the turbulent\r\npretenders to his title. Within was a large court-yard, flanked by a\r\nrange of buildings, some of good stone-work, some of wattle, in all\r\nstages of disrepair. A great crowd of people occupied one end of the\r\ncourt, and at the other we were received by the Dewan, and seated on\r\nchairs under a canopy supported by slender silvered columns.\r\nSome slovenly Natch-girls were dancing before us, kicking up clouds\r\nof dust, and singing or rather bawling through their noses, the usual\r\nindelicate hymns in honour of the Hooli festival; there were also\r\nfiddlers, cutting uncouth capers in rhythm with the dancers.\r\nAnything more deplorable than the music, dancing, and accompaniments,\r\ncannot well be imagined; yet the people seemed vastly pleased, and\r\nextolled the performers.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the Rajah and his brothers was announced by a crash of\r\ntom-toms and trumpets, while over their heads were carried great gilt\r\ncanopies. With them came a troop of relations, of all ages; and\r\namongst them a poor little black girl, dressed in honour of us in an\r\nold-fashioned  English chintz frock and muslin cap, in which she cut\r\nthe drollest figure imaginable; she was carried about for our\r\nadmiration, like a huge Dutch doll, crying lustily all the time.\r\n\r\nThe festivities of the evening commenced by handing round trays full\r\nof pith-balls, the size of a nutmeg, filled with a mixture of flour,\r\nsand, and red lac-powder; with these each pelted his neighbour, the\r\nthin covering bursting as it struck any object, and powdering it\r\ncopiously with red dust. A more childish and disagreeable sport\r\ncannot well be conceived; and when the balls were expended, the dust\r\nitself was resorted to, not only fresh, but that which had already\r\nbeen used was gathered up, with whatever dirt it might have become\r\nmixed. One rude fellow, with his hand full, sought to entrap his\r\nvictims into talking, when he would stuff the nasty mixture into\r\ntheir mouths.\r\n\r\nAt the end attar of roses was brought, into which little pieces of\r\ncotton, fixed on slips of bamboo, were dipped, and given to each\r\nperson. The heat, dust, stench of the unwashed multitude, noise, and\r\nincreasing familiarity of the lower orders, warned us to retire, and\r\nwe effected our retreat with precipitancy.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah and his brother were very fine boys, lively, frank,\r\nunaffected, and well disposed: they have evidently a good guide in\r\nthe old Dewan; but it is melancholy to think how surely, should they\r\ngrow up in possession of their present rank, they will lapse into\r\nslothful habits, and take their place amongst the imbeciles who now\r\nrepresent the once powerful Rajahs of Bengal.\r\n\r\nWe rode back to our tents by a bright moonlight, very dusty and\r\ntired, and heartily glad to breathe the cool fresh air, after the\r\nstifling ordeal we had undergone.\r\n\r\nOn the following evening the elephants were again in waiting to\r\nconduct us to the Rajah. He and his relations  were assembled outside\r\nthe gates, mounted upon elephants, amid a vast concourse of people.\r\nThe children and Dewan were seated in a sort of cradle; the rest were\r\nsome in howdahs, and some astride on elephants' backs, six or eight\r\ntogether. All the idols were paraded before them, and powdered with\r\nred dust; the people howling, shouting, and sometimes quarrelling.\r\nOur elephants took their places amongst those of the Rajah; and when\r\nthe mob had sufficiently pelted one another with balls and dirty red\r\npowder, a torchlight procession was formed, the idols leading the\r\nway, to a very large tank, bounded by a high rampart, within which\r\nwas a broad esplanade round the water.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the whole was very striking, the glittering cars and\r\nbarbaric gaud of the idols showing best by torchlight; while the\r\nwhite robes and turbans of the undulating sea of people, and the\r\ngreat black elephants picking their way with matchless care and\r\nconsideration, contrasted strongly with the quiet moonbeams sleeping\r\non the still broad waters of the tank.\r\n\r\nThence the procession moved to a field, where the idols were placed\r\non the ground, and all dismounted: the Dewan then took the children\r\nby the hand, and each worshipped his tutelary deity in a short prayer\r\ndictated by the attendant Brahmin, and threw a handful of red dust in\r\nits face. After another ordeal of powder, singing, dancing, and\r\nsuffocation, our share in the Hooli ended; and having been promised\r\nelephants for the following morning, we bade a cordial farewell to\r\nour engaging little hosts and their staid old governor.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of March we were awakened at an early hour by a heavy\r\nthunder-storm from the south-west. The sunrise was very fine, through\r\nan arch 10 degrees high of bright blue sky, above which the whole\r\nfirmament was mottled with cirrus. It continued cloudy, with light\r\nwinds,  througbout the day, but clear on the horizon. From this tinge\r\nsuch storms became frequent, ushering in the equinox; and the less\r\nhazy sky and rising hygrometer predicted an accession of moisture in\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe left for Rangamally, a village eight miles distant in a northerly\r\ndirection, our course lying along the west bank of the Teesta.\r\n\r\nThe river is here navigated by canoes, thirty to forty feet long,\r\nsome being rudely cut out of a solid log of Sal, while others are\r\nbuilt, the planks, of which there are but few, being sewed together,\r\nor clamped with iron, and the seams caulked with the fibres of the\r\nroot of Dhak (_Butea frondosa_), and afterwards smeared with the\r\ngluten of _Diospyros embryopteris._ The bed of the river is here\r\nthreequarters of a mile across, of which the stream does not occupy\r\none-third; its banks are sand-cliffs, fourteen feet in height. A few\r\nsmall fish and water-snakes swarm in the pools.\r\n\r\nThe whole country improved in fertility as we advanced towards the\r\nmountains: the grass became greener, and more trees, shrubs, herbs,\r\nand birds appeared. In front, the dark boundary-line of the Sal\r\nforest loomed on the horizon, and to the east rose the low hills of\r\nBhotan, both backed by the outer ranges of the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nFlocks of cranes were abundant over-head, flying in wedges, or\r\nbreaking up into \"open order,\" preparing for their migration\r\nnorthwards, which takes place in April, their return occurring in\r\nOctober; a small quail was also common on the ground. Tamarisk\r\n(\"Jhow\") grew in the sandy bed of the river; its flexible young\r\nbranches are used in various parts of India for wattling and\r\nbasket-making.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we walked to the skirts of the Sal forest.  The great\r\ntrunks of the trees were often scored by tigers' claws, this animal\r\nindulging in the cat-like propensity of rising and stretching itself\r\nagainst such objects. Two species of _Dillenia_ were common in the\r\nforest, with long grass, _Symplocos, Emblica,_ and _Cassia Fistula,_\r\nnow covered with long pods. Several parasitical air-plants grew on\r\nthe dry trees, as _Oberonia, Vanda,_ and _Aerides._\r\n\r\nAt Rangamally, the height of the sandy banks of the Teesta varies\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty feet. The bed is a mile across, and all sand;*\r\n[Now covered with _Anthistiria_ grass, fifteen feet high, a little\r\n_Sissoo,_ and _Bombax._] the current much divided, and opaque green,\r\nfrom the glacial origin of most of its head-streams. The west bank\r\nwas covered with a small Sal forest, mixed with _Acacia Catechu,_ and\r\nbrushwood, growing in a poor vegetable loam, over very dry sand.\r\n\r\nThe opposite (or Bhotan) bank is much lower, and always flooded\r\nduring the rains, which is not the case on the western side, where\r\nthe water rises to ten feet below the top of the bank, or from seven\r\nto ten feet above its height in the dry season, and it then fills its\r\nwhole bed. This information we had from a police Jemadar, who has\r\nresided many years on this unhealthy spot, and annually suffers from\r\nfever. The Sal forest has been encroached upon from the south, for\r\nmany miles, within the memory of man, by clearing in patches, and by\r\nindiscriminate felling.\r\n\r\nAbout ten miles north of Rangamally, we came to an extensive flat,\r\noccupying a recess in the high west bank, the site of the old capital\r\n(Bai-kant-pore) of the Jeelpigoree Rajah. Hemmed in as it is on three\r\nsides by a dense forest, and on all by many miles of malarious Terai,\r\nit appears sufficiently secure from ordinary enemies, during a great\r\npart of the year. The soil is sandy, overlying gravel,  and covered\r\nwith a thick stratum of fine mud or silt, which is only deposited on\r\nthese low flats; on it grew many naturalized plants, as hemp,\r\ntobacco, jack, mango, plantain, and orange.\r\n\r\nAbout eight miles on, we left the river-bed, and struck westerly\r\nthrough a dense forest, to a swampy clearance occupied by the village\r\nof Rummai, which appeared thoroughly malarious; and we pitched the\r\ntent on a narrow, low ridge, above the level of the plain.\r\n\r\nIt was now cool and pleasant, partly due, no doubt, to a difference\r\nin the vegetation, and the proximity of swamp and forest, and partly\r\nalso to a change in the weather, which was cloudy and threatening;\r\nmuch rain, too, had fallen here on the preceding day.\r\n\r\nBrahmins and priests of all kinds are few in this miserable country:\r\nnear the villages, and under the large trees, are, every here and\r\nthere, a few immature thatched cottages, four to six feet high, in\r\nwhich the tutelary deities of the place are kept; they are idols of\r\nthe very rudest description, of Vishnu as an ascetic (Bai-kant Nath),\r\na wooden doll, gilt and painted, standing, with the hands raised as\r\nif in exhortation, and one leg crossed over the other. Again, Kartik,\r\nthe god of war, is represented sitting astride on a peacock, with the\r\nright hand elevated and holding a small flat cup.\r\n\r\nSome fine muscular Cooches were here brought for Mr. Hodgson's\r\nexamination, but we found them unable or unwilling to converse, in\r\nthe Cooch tongue, which appears to be fast giving place to Bengalee.\r\n\r\nWe walked to a stream, which flows at the base of the retiring\r\nsand-cliffs, and nourishes a dense and richly-varied jungle,\r\nproducing many plants, as beautiful _Acanthaceae,_ Indian\r\nhorse-chesnut, loaded with white racemes of flowers,  gay\r\n_Convolvuli,_ laurels, terrestrial and parasitic _Orchideae,\r\nDillenia,_ casting its enormous flowers as big as two fists, pepper,\r\nfigs, and, in strange association with these, a hawthorn, and the\r\nyellow-flowered Indian strawberry, which ascends 7,500 feet on the\r\nmountains, and _Hodgsonia,_ a new _Cucurbitaceous_ genus, clinging in\r\nprofusion to the trees, and also found 5000 feet high on the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we rode into the forest (which was dry and very\r\nunproductive), and thence along the river-banks, through _Acacia\r\nCatechu,_ belted by _Sissoo,_ which often fringes the stream, always\r\noccupying the lowest flats. The foliage at this season is brilliantly\r\ngreen; and as the evening advanced, a yellow convolvulus burst into\r\nflower like magic, adorning the bushes over which it climbed.\r\n\r\nIt rained on the following morning; after which we left for the exit\r\nof the Teesta, proceeding northwards, sometimes through a dense\r\nforest of Sal timber, sometimes dipping into marshy depressions, or\r\nriding through grassy savannahs, breast-high. The coolness of the\r\natmosphere was delicious, and the beauty of the jungle seemed to\r\nincrease the further we penetrated these primaeval forests.\r\n\r\nEight miles from Rummai we came on a small river from the mountains,\r\nwith a Cooch village close by, inhabited during the dry season by\r\ntimber-cutters from Jeelpigoree it is situated upon a very rich black\r\nsoil, covered with _Saccharum_ and various gigantic grasses, but no\r\nbamboo. These long grasses replace the Sal, of which we did not see\r\none good tree.\r\n\r\nWe here mounted the elephants, and proceeded several miles through\r\nthe prairie, till we again struck upon the high Sal forest-bank,\r\ncontinuous with that of Rummai and Rangamally, but much loftier: it\r\nformed one of many terraces which stretch along the foot of the\r\nhills, from  Punkabaree to the Teesta, but of which none are said to\r\noccur for eight miles eastwards along the Bhotan Dooars: if true,\r\nthis is probably due in part to the alteration of the course of the\r\nTeesta, which is gradually working to the westward, and cutting away\r\nthese lofty banks.\r\n\r\nThe elephant-drivers appeared to have taken us by mistake to the exit\r\nof the Chawa, a small stream which joins the Teesta further to the\r\neastward. The descent to the bed of this rivulet, round the first\r\nspur of rock we met with, was fully eighty feet, through a very\r\nirregular depression, probably the old bed of the stream; it runs\r\nsouthwards from the hills, and was covered from top to bottom with\r\nslate-pebbles. We followed the river to its junction with the Teesta,\r\nalong a flat, broad gulley, bounded by densely-wooded, steep banks of\r\nclay slate on the north, and the lofty bank on the south: between\r\nthese the bed was strewed with great boulders of gneiss and other\r\nrocks, luxuriantly clothed with long grass, and trees of wild\r\nplantain, _Erythrina_ and _Bauhinia,_ the latter gorgeously\r\nin flower.\r\n\r\nThe Sal bank formed a very fine object: it was quite perpendicular,\r\nand beautifully stratified with various coloured sands and gravel: it\r\ntailed off abruptly at the junction of the rivers, and then trended\r\naway south-west, forming the west bank of the Teesta. The latter\r\nriver is at its outlet a broad and rapid, but hardly impetuous\r\nstream, now fifty yards across, gushing from between two low,\r\nforest-clad spurs: it appeared about five feet deep, and was\r\nbeautifully fringed on both sides with green _Sissoo._\r\n\r\nSome canoes were here waiting for us, formed of hollowed trunks of\r\ntrees, thirty feet long: two were lashed together with bamboos, and\r\nthe boatmen sat one at the head and one at the stern of each: we lay\r\nalong the  bottom of the vessels, and in a second we were darting\r\ndown the river, at the rate of at least ten or fifteen miles an hour,\r\nthe bright waters leaping up on all sides, and bounding in\r\n_jets-d'eau_ between prows and sterns of the coupled vessels.\r\nSometimes we glided along without perceptible motion, and at others\r\njolted down bubbling rapids, the steersmen straining every nerve to\r\nkeep their bark's head to the current, as she impatiently swerved\r\nfrom side to side in the eddies. To our jaded and parched frames,\r\nafter the hot forenoon's ride on the elephants, the effect was\r\ndelicious: the fresh breeze blew on our heated foreheads and down our\r\nopen throats and chests; we dipped our hands into the clear, cool\r\nstream, and there was \"music in the waters\" to our ears.\r\nFresh verdure on the banks, clear pebbles, soft sand, long English\r\nriver-reaches, forest glades, and deep jungles, followed in rapid\r\nsuccession; and as often as we rounded a bend or shot a rapid, the\r\nscene changed from bright to brighter still; so continuing until\r\ndusk, when we were slowly paddling along the then torpid current\r\nopposite Rangamally.* [The following temperatures of the waters of\r\nthe Teesta were taken at intervals during our passage from its exit\r\nto Rangamally, a distance of fifteen linear miles, and thirty miles\r\nfollowing the bends:--\r\n\r\n                    Water.            Air.\r\nExit 2h. 30m. p.m.    62 degrees\r\n     3                62.2 degrees     74 degrees\r\n     3.30             63.2 degrees\r\n     4                64 degrees\r\n     4.30             65 degrees\r\n     5                65.4 degrees     72.5 degrees opposite Rummai\r\n     5.30             66 degrees\r\n     6                66 degrees       71.7 degrees opposite Baikant]\r\n\r\nThe absence of large stones or boulders of rock in the bed of the\r\nTeesta is very remarkable, considering the great volume and rapidity\r\nof the current, and that it shoots directly from the rocky hills to\r\nthe gravelly plains. At the  _embouchure_ there are boulders as big\r\nas the head, and in the stream, four miles below the exit, the\r\nboatmen pointed out a stone as large as the body as quite a marvel.\r\n\r\nThey assured us that the average rise at the mouth of the river, in\r\nthe rains, was not more than five feet: the mean breadth of the\r\nstream is from seventy to ninety yards. From the point where it\r\nleaves the mountains, to its junction with the Megna, is at this\r\nseason thirteen days' voyage, the return occupying from twenty to\r\ntwenty-five days, with the boats unladen. The name \"Teesta\" signifies\r\n\"quiet,\" this river being so in comparison with other Himalayan\r\ntorrents further west, the Cosi, Konki, etc., which are devastators\r\nof all that bounds their course.\r\n\r\nWe passed but two crossing-places: at one the river is divided by an\r\nisland, covered with the rude chaits and flags of the Boodhists.\r\nWe also saw some Cooch fishermen, who throw the net much as we do:\r\na fine \"Mahaser\" (a very large carp) was the best fish they had.\r\nOf cultivation there was very little, and the only habitations were a\r\nfew grass-huts of the boatmen or buffalo herdsmen, a rare Cooch\r\nvillage of Catechu and Sal cutters, or the shelter of\r\ntimber-floaters, who seem to pass the night in nests of long\r\ndry grass.\r\n\r\nOur servants not having returned with the elephants from Rummai, we\r\nspent the following day at Rangamally shooting and botanizing.\r\nI collected about 100 species in a couple of hours, and observed\r\nperhaps twice that number: the more common I have repeatedly alluded\r\nto, and excepting some small terrestrial _Orchids,_ I added nothing\r\nof particular interest to my collection.* [The following is a list of\r\nthe principal genera, most of which are English:--_Polygonum,\r\nQuercus, Sonchus, Gnaphalium, Cratagus, Lobelia, Lactuca,\r\nHydrocotyle, Saponaria, Campanula, Bidens, Rubus, Oxalis, Artemisia,\r\nFragaria, Clematis, Dioscorea, Potamogeton, Chara, Veronica,\r\nViola, Smilax._]\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of March we proceeded west to Siligoree, along the skirts\r\nof the ragged Sal forest. Birds are certainly the most conspicuous\r\nbranch of the natural history of this country, and we saw many\r\nspecies, interesting either from their habits, beauty, or extensive\r\ndistribution. We noticed no less than sixteen kinds of swimming\r\nbirds, several of which are migratory and English. The Shoveller,\r\nwhite-eyed and common wild ducks; Merganser, Brahminee, and Indian\r\ngoose (_Anser Indica_); common and Gargany teal; two kinds of gull;\r\none of Shearwater (_Rhynchops ablacus_); three of tern, and one of\r\ncormorant. Besides these there were three egrets, the large crane,\r\nstork, green heron, and the demoiselle; the English sand-martin,\r\nkingfisher, peregrine-falcon, sparrow-hawk, kestrel, and the European\r\nvulture: the wild peacock, and jungle-fowl. There were at least 100\r\npeculiarly Indian birds in addition, of which the more remarkable\r\nwere several kinds of mina, of starling, vulture, kingfisher, magpie,\r\nquail, and lapwing.\r\n\r\nThe country gradually became quite beautiful, much undulated and\r\ndiversified by bright green meadows, sloping lawns, and deeply wooded\r\nnullahs, which lead from the Sal forest and meander through this\r\nvaried landscape. More beautiful sites for fine mansions could not\r\nwell be, and it is difficult to suppose so lovely a country should be\r\nso malarious as it is before and after the rains, excessive heat\r\nprobably diffusing widely the miasma from small stagnant surfaces.\r\nWe noticed a wild hog, absolutely the first wild beast of any size I\r\nsawon the plains, except the hispid hare (_Lepus hispidus_) and the\r\nbarking deer (_Stylocerus ratna_). The hare we found to be the best\r\ngame of this part of India, except the teal. The pheasants of\r\nDorjiling are poor, the deer all but uneatable, and the florican,\r\nhowever dressed, I considered a far from excellent bird.\r\n\r\nA good many plants grow along the streams, the sandy beds of which\r\nare everywhere covered with the marks of tigers' feet. The only safe\r\nway of botanizing is by pushing through the jungle on elephants; an\r\nuncomfortable method, from the quantity of ants and insects which\r\ndrop from the foliage above, and from the risk of disturbing\r\npendulous bees' and ants' nests.\r\n\r\nA peculiar species of willow (_Salix tetrasperma_) is common here;\r\nwhich is a singular fact, as the genus is characteristic of cold and\r\narctic latitudes; and no species is found below 5000 feet elevation\r\non the Sikkim mountain, where it grows on the inner Himalaya only,\r\nsome kinds ascending to 16,000 feet.\r\n\r\nEast of Siligoree the plains are unvaried by tree or shrub, and are\r\nbarren wastes of short turf or sterile sand, with the dwarf-palm\r\n(_Phoenix acaulis_), a sure sign of a most hungry soil.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the journey I performed on elephants during the\r\nheat of the day, and a more uncomfortable mode of conveyance surely\r\nnever was adopted; the camel's pace is more fatiguing, but that of\r\nthe elephant is extremely trying after a few miles, and is so\r\ninjurious to the human frame that the Mahouts (drivers) never reach\r\nan advanced age, and often succumb young to spine-diseases, brought\r\non by the incessant motion of the vertebral column. The broiling heat\r\nof the elephant's black back, and the odour of its oily driver, are\r\ndisagreeable accompaniments, as are its habits of snorting water from\r\nits trunk over its parched skin, and the consequences of the great\r\nbulk of green food which it consumes.\r\n\r\nFrom Siligoree I made a careful examination of the  gravel beds that\r\noccur on the road north to the foot of the hills, and thence over the\r\ntertiary sandstone to Punkabaree. At the Rukti river, which flows\r\nsouth-west, the road suddenly rises, and crosses the first\r\nconsiderable hill, about two miles south of any rock _in situ._\r\nThis river cuts a cliff from 60 to 100 feet high, composed of\r\nstratified sand and water-worn gravel: further south, the spur\r\ndeclines into the plains, its course marked by the Sal that thrives\r\non its gravelly soil. The road then runs north-west over a plain to\r\nan isolated hill about 200 feet high, also formed of sand and gravel.\r\nWe ascended to the top of this, and found it covered with blocks of\r\ngneiss, and much angular detritus. Hence the road gradually ascends,\r\nand becomes clayey. Argillaceous rocks, and a little ochreous\r\nsandstone appeared in highly-inclined strata, dipping north, and\r\ncovered with great water-worn blocks of gneiss. Above, a flat\r\nterrace, flanked to the eastward by a low wooded hill, and another\r\nrise of sandstone, lead on to the great Baisarbatti terrace.\r\n\r\n_Bombax, Erythrina,_ and _Duabanga_ (_Lagaerstraemia grandiflora_),\r\nwere in full flower, and with the profusion of _Bauhinia,_ rendered\r\nthe tree-jungle gay: the two former are leafless when flowering.\r\nThe Duabanga is the pride of these forests. Its trunk, from eight to\r\nfifteen feet in girth, is generally forked from the base, and the\r\nlong pendulous branches which clothe the trunk for 100 feet, are\r\nthickly leafy, and terminated by racemes of immense white flowers,\r\nwhich, especially when in bud, smell most disagreeably of\r\nassafoetida. The magnificent Apocyneous climber, _Beaumontia,_ was in\r\nfull bloom, ascending the loftiest trees, and clothing their trunks\r\nwith its splendid foliage and festoons of enormous funnel-shaped\r\nwhite flowers.\r\n\r\nThe report of a bed of iron-stone eight or ten miles west  of\r\nPunkabaree determined our visiting the spot; and the locality being\r\nin a dense jungle, the elephants were sent on ahead.\r\n\r\nWe descended to the terraces flanking the Balasun river, and struck\r\nwest along jungle-paths to a loosely-timbered flat. A sudden descent\r\nof 150 feet landed us on a second terrace. Further on, a third dip of\r\nabout twenty feet (in some places obliterated) flanks the bed of the\r\nBalasun; the river itself being split into many channels at this\r\nseason. The west bank, which is forty feet high, is of stratified\r\nsand and gravel, with vast slightly-worn blocks of gneiss: from the\r\ntop of this we proceeded south-west for three miles to some Mechi\r\nvillages, the inhabitants of which flocked to meet us, bringing milk\r\nand refreshments.\r\n\r\nThe Lohar-ghur, or \"iron hill,\" lies in a dense dry forest.\r\nIts plain-ward flanks are very steep, and covered with scattered\r\nweather-worn masses of ochreous and black iron-stone, many of which\r\nare several yards long: it fractures with faint metallic lustre, and\r\nis very earthy in parts: it does not affect the compass. There are no\r\npebbles of iron-stone, nor water-worn rocks of any kind found\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThe sandstones, close by, cropped out in thick beds (dip north 70\r\ndegrees): they are very soft, and beds of laminated clay, and of a\r\nslaty rock, are intercalated with them; also an excessively tough\r\nconglomerate, formed of an indurated blue or grey paste, with nodules\r\nof harder clay. There are no traces of metal in the rock, and the\r\nlumps of ore are wholly superficial.\r\n\r\nBelow Punkabaree the Baisarbatti stream cuts through banks of gravel\r\noverlying the sandstone (dip north 65 degrees). The sandstone is\r\ngritty and micaceous, intercalated with beds of indurated shale and\r\nclay; in which I found the shaft (apparently) of a bone; there were\r\nalso beds of the  same clay conglomerate which I had seen at\r\nLohar-ghur, and thin seams of brown lignite; with a rhomboidal\r\ncleavage. In the bed of the stream were carbonaceous shales, with\r\nobscure impressions of fern leaves, of _Trizygia,_ and _Vertebraria_:\r\nboth fossils characteristic of the Burdwan coal-fields (see Chapter\r\nI), but too imperfect to justify any conclusion as to the relation\r\nbetween these formations.* [These traces of fossils are not\r\nsufficient to identify the formation with that of the sewalik hills\r\nof North-west India; but its contents, together with its strike, dip,\r\nand position relatively to the mountains, and its mineralogical\r\ncharacter, incline me to suppose it may be similar. Its appearance in\r\nsuch small quantities in Sikkim (where it rises but a few hundred\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, whereas in Kumaon it reaches 4000\r\nfeet), may be attributed to the greater amount of wearing which it\r\nmust have undergone; the plains from which it rises being 1000 feet\r\nlower than those of Kumaon, and the sea having consequently retired\r\nlater, exposing the Sikkim sandstone to the effects of denudation for\r\na much longer period. Hitherto no traces of this rock, or of any\r\nbelonging to a similar geological epoch, have been found in the\r\nvalleys of Sikkim; but when the narrowness of these is considered, it\r\nwill not appear strange that such may have been removed from their\r\nsurfaces: first, by the action of a tidal ocean; and afterwards, by\r\nthat of tropical rains.]\r\n\r\nAscending the stream, these shales are seen _in situ,_ overlain by\r\nthe metamorphic clay-slate of the mountains, and dipping inwards\r\n(northwards) like them. This is at the foot of the Punkabaree spur,\r\nand close to the bungalow, where a stream and land-slip expose good\r\nsections. The carbonaceous beds dip north 60 degrees and 70 degrees,\r\nand run east and west; much quartz rock is intercalated with them,\r\nand soft white and pink micaceous sandstones. The coal-seams are few\r\nin number, six to twelve inches thick, very confused and distorted,\r\nand full of elliptic nodules, or spheroids of quartzy slate, covered\r\nwith concentric scaly layers of coal: they overlie the sandstones\r\nmentioned above. These scanty notices of superposition being\r\ncollected in a country clothed with the densest tropical forest,\r\nwhere a geologist pursues his fatiguing investigations under\r\ndisadvantages that can hardly be realized in England, will I fear\r\nlong remain unconfirmed.  I may mention, however, that the appearance\r\nof inversion of the strata at the foot of great mountain-masses has\r\nbeen observed in the Alleghany chain, and I believe in the Alps.*\r\n[Dr. M'Lelland informs me that in the Curruckpore hills, south of the\r\nGanges, the clay-slates are overlain by beds of mica-slate, gneiss,\r\nand granite, which pass into one another.]\r\n\r\nIllustration--A MECH, NATIVE OF THE SIKKIM TERAI.\r\n\r\nA poor Mech was fishing in the stream, with a basket curiously formed\r\nof a cylinder of bamboo, cleft all round in innumerable strips, held\r\ntogether by the joints above and below; these strips being stretched\r\nout as a balloon in the  middle, and kept apart by a hoop: a small\r\nhole is cut in the cage, and a mouse-trap entrance formed: the cage\r\nis placed in the current with the open end upwards, where the fish\r\nget in, and though little bigger than minnows, cannot find their\r\nway out.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th we had a change in the weather: a violent storm from the\r\nsouth-west occurred at noon, with hail of a strange form, the stones\r\nbeing sections of hollow spheres, half an inch across and upwards,\r\nformed of cones with truncated apices and convex bases; these cones\r\nwere aggregated together with their bases outwards. The large masses\r\nwere followed by a shower of the separate conical pieces, and that by\r\nheavy rain. On the mountains this storm was most severe: the stones\r\nlay at Dorjiling for seven days, congealed into masses of ice several\r\nfeet long and a foot thick in sheltered places: at Purneah, fifty\r\nmiles south, stones one and two inches across fell, probably as\r\nwhole spheres.\r\n\r\nAscending to Khersiong, I found the vegetation very backward by the\r\nroad-sides. The rain had cleared the atmosphere, and the view over\r\nthe plains was brilliant. On the top of the Khersiong spur a\r\ntremendous gale set in with a cold west wind: the storm cleared off\r\nat night, which at 10 p.m. was beautiful, with forked and sheet\r\nlightning over the plains far below us. The equinoctial gales had now\r\nfairly set in, with violent south-east gales, heavy thunder,\r\nlightning, and rain.\r\n\r\nWhilst at Khersiong I took advantage of the very fair section\r\nafforded by the road from Punkabaree, to examine the structure of the\r\nspur, which seems to be composed of very highly inclined contorted\r\nbeds (dip north) of metamorphic rocks, gneiss, mica-slate,\r\nclay-slate, and quartz; the foliation of which beds is parallel to\r\nthe dip of the strata. Over all reposes a bed of clay, capped with a\r\nlayer of  vegetable mould, nowhere so thick and rich as in the more\r\nhumid regions of 7000 feet elevation. The rocks appeared in the\r\nfollowing succession in descending. Along the top are found great\r\nblocks of very compact gneiss buried in clay. Half a mile lower the\r\nsame rock appears, dipping north-north-east 50 degrees. Below this,\r\nbeds of saccharine quartz, with seams of mica, dip north-north-west\r\n20 degrees. Some of these quartz beds are folded on themselves, and\r\nlook like flattened trunks of trees, being composed of concentric\r\nlayers, each from two to four inches thick: we exposed twenty-seven\r\nfeet of one fold running along the side of the road, which was cut\r\nparallel to the strike. Each layer of quartz was separated from its\r\nfellows, by one of mica scales; and was broken up into cubical\r\nfragments, whose surfaces are no doubt cleavage and jointing places.\r\nI had previously seen, but not understood, such flexures produced by\r\nmetamorphic action on masses of quartz when in a pasty state, in the\r\nFalkland Islands, where they have been perfectly well described by\r\nMr. Darwin;* [Journal of Geological Society for 1846, p. 267, and\r\n\"Voyage of the Beagle\".] in whose views of the formation of these\r\nrocks I entirely concur.\r\n\r\nThe flexures of the gneiss are incomparably more irregular and\r\nconfused than those of the quartz, and often contain flattened\r\nspheres of highly crystalline felspar, that cleave perpendicularly to\r\nthe shorter axis. These spheres are disposed in layers parallel to\r\nthe foliation of the gneiss: and are the result of a metamorphic\r\naction of great intensity, effecting a complete rearrangement and\r\ncrystallization of the quartz and mica in parallel planes, whilst the\r\nfelspar is aggregated in spheres; just as in the rearrangement of the\r\nmineral constituents of mica-schists, the alumina is crystallized in\r\nthe garnets, and in the clay-slates the iron into pyrites.\r\n\r\nThe quartz below this dips north-north-west 45 degrees to 50 degrees,\r\nand alternates with a very hard slaty schist, dipping north-west 45\r\ndegrees, and still lower is a blue-grey clay-slate, dipping\r\nnorth-north-west 30 degrees. These rest on beds of slate, folded like\r\nthe quartz mentioned above, but with cleavage-planes, forming lines\r\nradiating from the axis of each flexure, and running through all the\r\nconcentric folds. Below this are the plumbago and clay slates of\r\nPunkabaree, which alternate with beds of mica-schist with garnets,\r\nand appear to repose immediately upon the carboniferous strata and\r\nsandstone; but there is much disturbance at the junction.\r\n\r\nOn re-ascending from Punkabaree, the rocks gradually appear more and\r\nmore dislocated, the clay-slate less so than the quartz and\r\nmica-schist, and that again far less than the gneiss, which is so\r\nshattered and bent, that it is impossible to say what is _in situ,_\r\nand what not. Vast blocks lie superficially on the ridges; and the\r\ntops of all the outer mountains, as of Khersiong spur, of Tonglo,\r\nSinchul, and Dorjiling, appear a pile of such masses. Injected veins\r\nof quartz are rare in the lower beds of schist and clay-slate, whilst\r\nthe gneiss is often full of them; and on the inner and loftier\r\nranges, these quartz veins are replaced by granite with tourmaline.\r\n\r\nLime is only known as a stalactitic deposit from various streams, at\r\nelevations from 1000 to 7000 feet; one such stream occurs above\r\nPunkabaree, which I have not seen; another within the Sinchul range,\r\non the great Rungeet river, above the exit of the Rummai; a third\r\nwholly in the great central Himalayan range, flowing into the Lachen\r\nriver. The total absence of any calcareous rock in Sikkim, and the\r\nappearance of the deposit in isolated streams at such distant\r\nlocalities, probably indicates a very remote origin of the\r\nlime-charged waters.\r\n\r\nFrom Khersiong to Dorjiling, gneiss is the only rock, and is often\r\ndecomposed into clay-beds, 20 feet deep, in which the narrow, often\r\nzigzag folia of quartz remain quite entire and undisturbed, whilst\r\nevery trace of the foliation of the softer mineral is lost.\r\n\r\nAt Pacheem, Dorjiling weather, with fog and drizzle, commenced, and\r\ncontinued for two days: we, reached Dorjiling on the 24th of March,\r\nand found that the hail which had fallen on the 20th was still lying\r\nin great masses of crumbling ice in sheltered spots. The fall had\r\ndone great damage to the gardens, and Dr. Campbell's tea-plants were\r\ncut to pieces.\r\n\r\nIllustration--POCKET-COMB USED BY THE MECH TRIBES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME I OF HIMALAYAN JOURNALS.",
