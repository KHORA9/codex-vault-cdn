There are\r\ndifferences in spelling and punctuation in the different chapters (e.g.\r\ncocoanut in one chapter and coconut in another). These differences were\r\nleft in the text as they appeared.\r\n\r\nFor Text: A word surrounded by a tilde such as ~this~ signifies that\r\nthe word is bolded in the text. A word surrounded by underscores like\r\n_this_ signifies the word is italics in the text.\r\n\r\nFor numbers and equations: Parentheses have been added to clarify\r\nfractions. Underscores before bracketed numbers in equations denote a\r\nsubscript. The Degree symbol has been changed to deg. in the ASCII\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nMinor typos have been corrected and footnotes moved to the end of the\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFATORY NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe material contained in this work appeared several years ago in serial\r\nform in the American Perfumer and Essential Oil Review. Owing to the\r\nnumerous requests received, it has been decided to now place before\r\nthose interested, these articles in book form. While it is true that the\r\nworks pertaining to the soapmaking industry are reasonably plentiful,\r\nbooks are quite rare, however, which, in a brief volume, will clearly\r\noutline the processes employed together with the necessary methods of\r\nanalyses from a purely practical standpoint. In the work presented the\r\nauthor has attempted to briefly, clearly, and fully explain the\r\nmanufacture of soap in such language that it might be understood by all\r\nthose interested in this industry. In many cases the smaller plants find\r\nit necessary to dispense with the services of a chemist, so that it is\r\nnecessary for the soapmaker to make his own tests. The tests outlined,\r\ntherefore, are given as simple as possible to meet this condition. The\r\nformulae submitted are authentic, and in many cases are now being used\r\nin soapmaking.\r\n\r\nIn taking up the industry for survey it has been thought desirable to\r\nfirst mention and describe the raw materials used; second, to outline\r\nthe processes of manufacture; third, to classify the methods and\r\nillustrate by formulae the composition of various soaps together with\r\ntheir mode of manufacture; fourth, to enumerate the various methods of\r\nglycerine recovery, including the processes of saponification, and,\r\nfifth, to give the most important analytical methods which are of value\r\nto control the process of manufacture and to determine the purity and\r\nfitness of the raw material entering into it.\r\n\r\nIt is not the intention of the author to go into great detail in this\r\nwork, nor to outline to any great extent the theoretical side of the\r\nsubject, but rather to make the work as brief as possible, keeping the\r\npractical side of the subject before him and not going into concise\r\ndescriptions of machinery as is very usual in works on this subject.\r\nIllustrations are merely added to show typical kinds of machinery used.\r\n\r\nThe author wishes to take this opportunity of thanking Messrs. L. S.\r\nLevy and E. W. Drew for the reading of proof, and Mr. C. W. Aiken of the\r\nHouchin-Aiken Co., for his aid in making the illustrations a success, as\r\nwell as others who have contributed in the compiling of the formulae for\r\nvarious soaps. He trusts that this work may prove of value to those\r\nengaged in soap manufacture.\r\n\r\nE. G.

In a general and strictly chemical sense this term is\r\napplied to the salts of the non-volatile fatty acids. These salts are\r\nnot only those formed by the alkali metals, sodium and potassium, but\r\nalso those formed by the heavy metals and alkaline earths. Thus we have\r\nthe insoluble soaps of lime and magnesia formed when we attempt to wash\r\nin \"hard water\"; again aluminum soaps are used extensively in polishing\r\nmaterials and to thicken lubricating oils; ammonia or \"benzine\" soaps\r\nare employed among the dry cleaners. Commonly, however, when we speak of\r\nsoap we limit it to the sodium or potassium salt of a higher fatty acid.\r\n\r\nIt is very generally known that soap is made by combining a fat or oil\r\nwith a water solution of sodium hydroxide (caustic soda lye), or\r\npotassium hydroxide (caustic potash). Sodium soaps are always harder\r\nthan potassium soaps, provided the same fat or oil is used in both\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThe detergent properties of soap are due to the fact that it acts as an\r\nalkali regulator, that is, when water comes into contact with soap, it\r\nundergoes what is called hydrolytic dissociation. This means that it is\r\nbroken down by water into other substances. Just what these substances\r\nare is subject to controversy, though it is presumed caustic alkali and\r\nthe acid alkali salt of the fatty acids are formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOILS AND FATS.\r\n\r\nThere is no sharp distinction between fat and oil. By \"oil\" the layman\r\nhas the impression of a liquid which at warm temperature will flow as a\r\nslippery, lubricating, viscous fluid; by \"fat\" he understands a greasy,\r\nsolid substance unctuous to the touch. It thus becomes necessary to\r\ndifferentiate the oils and fats used in the manufacture of soap.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as a soap is the alkali salt of a fatty acid, the oil or fat\r\nfrom which soap is made must have as a constituent part, these fatty\r\nacids. Hydrocarbon oils or paraffines, included in the term \"oil,\" are\r\nthus useless in the process of soap-making, as far as entering into\r\nchemical combination with the caustic alkalis is concerned. The oils and\r\nfats which form soap are those which are a combination of fatty acids\r\nand glycerine, the glycerine being obtained as a by-product to the\r\nsoap-making industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF A FAT OR OIL USED IN SOAP MANUFACTURE.\r\n\r\nGlycerine, being a trihydric alcohol, has three atoms of hydrogen which\r\nare replaceable by three univalent radicals of the higher members of the\r\nfatty acids, _e. g._,\r\n\r\n                OH                       OR\r\n    C_{3} H_{5} OH + 3 ROH = C_{3} H_{5} OR + 3 H_{2}O\r\n                OH                       OR\r\n\r\nGlycerine plus 3 Fatty Alcohols equals Fat or Oil plus 3 Water.\r\n\r\nThus three fatty acid radicals combine with one glycerine to form a true\r\nneutral oil or fat which are called triglycerides. The fatty acids which\r\nmost commonly enter into combination of fats and oils are lauric,\r\nmyristic, palmitic, stearic and oleic acids and form the neutral oils or\r\ntriglycerides derived from these, _e. g._, stearin, palmatin, olein.\r\nMono and diglycerides are also present in fats.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAPONIFICATION DEFINED.\r\n\r\nWhen a fat or oil enters into chemical combination with one of the\r\ncaustic hydrates in the presence of water, the process is called\r\n\"saponification\" and the new compounds formed are soap and glycerine,\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n               OR                       OH\r\n    C_{3}H_{5} OR + 3 NaOH = C_{3}H_{5} OH + 3 NaOR\r\n               OR                       OH\r\n\r\nFat or Oil plus 3 Sodium Hydrate equals Glycerine plus 3 Soap.\r\n\r\nIt is by this reaction almost all of the soap used today is made.\r\n\r\nThere are also other means of saponification, as, the hydrolysis of an\r\noil or fat by the action of hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, by autoclave\r\nand by ferments or enzymes. By these latter processes the fatty acids\r\nand glycerine are obtained directly, no soap being formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATS AND OILS USED IN SOAP MANUFACTURE.\r\n\r\nThe various and most important oils and fats used in the manufacture of\r\nsoap are, tallow, cocoanut oil, palm oil, olive oil, poppy oil, sesame\r\noil, soya bean oil, cotton-seed oil, corn oil and the various greases.\r\nBesides these the fatty acids, stearic, red oil (oleic acid) are more or\r\nless extensively used. These oils, fats and fatty acids, while they vary\r\nfrom time to time and to some extent as to their color, odor and\r\nconsistency, can readily be distinguished by various physical and\r\nchemical constants.\r\n\r\nMuch can be learned by one, who through continued acquaintance with\r\nthese oils has thoroughly familiarized himself with the indications of a\r\ngood or bad oil, by taste, smell, feel and appearance. It is, however,\r\nnot well for the manufacturer in purchasing to depend entirely upon\r\nthese simpler tests. Since he is interested in the yield of glycerine,\r\nthe largest possible yield of soap per pound of soap stock and the\r\ngeneral body and appearance of the finished product, the chemical tests\r\nupon which these depend should be made. Those especially important are\r\nthe acid value, percentage unsaponifiable matter and titer test.\r\n\r\nA short description of the various oils and fats mentioned is sufficient\r\nfor their use in the soap industry.\r\n\r\n_Tallow_ is the name given to the fat extracted from the solid fat or\r\n\"suet\" of cattle, sheep or horses. The quality varies greatly, depending\r\nupon the seasons of the year, the food and age of the animal and the\r\nmethod of rendering. It comes to the market under the distinction of\r\nedible and inedible, a further distinction being made in commerce as\r\nbeef tallow, mutton tallow or horse tallow. The better quality is white\r\nand bleaches whiter upon exposure to air and light, though it usually\r\nhas a yellowish tint, a well defined grain and a clean odor. It consists\r\nchiefly of stearin, palmitin and olein. Tallow is by far the most\r\nextensively used and important fat in the making of soap.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of soaps for toilet purposes, it is usually necessary\r\nto produce as white a product as possible. In order to do this it often\r\nis necessary to bleach the tallow before saponification. The method\r\nusually employed is the Fuller's Earth process.\r\n\r\n\r\nFULLER'S EARTH PROCESS FOR BLEACHING TALLOW.\r\n\r\nFrom one to two tons of tallow are melted out into the bleaching tank.\r\nThis tank is jacketed, made of iron and provided with a good agitator\r\ndesigned to stir up sediment or a coil provided with tangential downward\r\nopening perforations and a draw-off cock at the bottom. The coil is the\r\nfar simpler arrangement, more cleanly and less likely to cause trouble.\r\nBy this arrangement compressed air which is really essential in the\r\nutilization of the press (see later) is utilized for agitation. A dry\r\nsteam coil in an ordinary tank may be employed in place of a jacketed\r\ntank, which lessens the cost of installation.\r\n\r\nThe tallow in the bleaching tank is heated to 180deg. F. (82deg. C.) and\r\nten pounds of dry salt per ton of fat used added and thoroughly mixed by\r\nagitation. This addition coagulates any albumen and dehydrates the fat.\r\nThe whole mass is allowed to settle over night where possible, or for at\r\nleast five hours. Any brine which has separated is drawn off from the\r\nbottom and the temperature of the fat is then raised to 160deg. F.\r\n(71deg. C).\r\n\r\nFive per cent. of the weight of the tallow operated upon, of dry\r\nFuller's earth is now added and the whole mass agitated from twenty to\r\nthirty minutes.\r\n\r\nThe new bleached fat, containing the Fuller's earth is pumped directly\r\nto a previously heated filter press and the issuing clear oil run\r\ndirectly to the soap kettle.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties experienced in the process is the heating of the\r\npress to a temperature sufficient to prevent solidification of the fat\r\nwithout raising the press to too great a temperature. To overcome this\r\nthe first plate is heated by wet steam. Air delivered from a blower and\r\nheated by passage through a series of coils raised to a high temperature\r\nby external application of heat (super-heated steam) is then substituted\r\nfor the steam. The moisture produced by the condensation of the steam is\r\nvaporized by the hot air and carried on gradually to each succeeding\r\nplate where it again condenses and vaporizes. In this way the small\r\nquantity of water is carried through the entire press, raising its\r\ntemperature to 80deg.-100deg. C. This temperature is subsequently\r\nmaintained by the passage of hot air. By this method of heating the poor\r\nconductivity of hot air is overcome through the intermediary action of a\r\nliquid vapor and the latent heat of steam is utilized to obtain the\r\ninitial rise in temperature. To heat a small press economically where\r\nconditions are such that a large output is not required the entire press\r\nmay be encased in a small wooden house which can be heated by steam\r\ncoils. The cake in the press is heated for some time after the\r\nfiltration is complete to assist drainage. After such treatment the cake\r\nshould contain approximately 15 per cent. fat and 25 per cent. water.\r\nThe cake is now removed from the press and transferred to a small tank\r\nwhere it is treated with sufficient caustic soda to convert the fat\r\ncontent into soap.\r\n\r\nSaturated brine is then added to salt out the soap, the Fuller's earth\r\nis allowed to settle to the bottom of the tank and the soap which\r\nsolidifies after a short time is skimmed off to be used in a cheap soap\r\nwhere color is not important. The liquor underneath may also be run off\r\nwithout disturbing the sediment to be used in graining a similar cheap\r\nsoap. The waste Fuller's earth contains about 0.1 to 0.3 per cent. of\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF COLOR.\r\n\r\nA further improvement of the color of the tallow may be obtained by\r\nfreeing it from a portion of its free fatty acids, either with or\r\nwithout previous Fuller's earth bleaching.\r\n\r\nTo carry out this process the melted fat is allowed to settle and as\r\nmuch water as possible taken off. The temperature is then raised to 160deg.\r\nF. with dry steam and enough saturated solution of soda ash added to\r\nremove 0.5 per cent. of the free fatty acids, while agitating the mass\r\nthoroughly mechanically or by air. The agitation is continued ten\r\nminutes, the whole allowed to settle for two hours and the foots drawn\r\noff. The soap thus formed entangles a large proportion of the impurities\r\nof the fat.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE OILS.\r\n\r\n_Cocoanut Oil_, as the name implies, is obtained from the fruit of the\r\ncocoanut palm. This oil is a solid, white fat at ordinary temperature,\r\nhaving a bland taste and a characteristic odor. It is rarely\r\nadulterated and is very readily saponified. In recent years the price of\r\nthis oil has increased materially because cocoanut oil is now being used\r\nextensively for edible purposes, especially in the making of\r\noleomargarine. Present indications are that shortly very little high\r\ngrade oil will be employed for soap manufacture since the demand for\r\noleomargarine is constantly increasing and since new methods of refining\r\nthe oil for this purpose are constantly being devised.\r\n\r\nThe oil is found in the market under three different grades: (1) Cochin\r\ncocoanut oil, the choicest oil comes from Cochin (Malabar). This\r\nproduct, being more carefully cultivated and refined than the other\r\ngrades, is whiter, cleaner and contains a smaller percentage of free\r\nacid. (2) Ceylon cocoanut oil, coming chiefly from Ceylon, is usually of\r\na yellowish tint and more acrid in odor than Cochin oil. (3) Continental\r\ncocoanut oil (Copra, Freudenberg) is obtained from the dried kernels,\r\nthe copra, which are shipped to Europe in large quantities, where the\r\noil is extracted. These dried kernels yield 60 to 70 per cent oil. This\r\nproduct is generally superior to the Ceylon oil and may be used as a\r\nvery satisfactory substitute for Cochin oil, in soap manufacture,\r\nprovided it is low in free acid and of good color. The writer has\r\nemployed it satisfactorily in the whitest and finest of toilet soaps\r\nwithout being able to distinguish any disadvantage to the Cochin oil.\r\nSince continental oil is usually cheaper than Cochin oil, it is\r\nadvisable to use it, as occasion permits.\r\n\r\nCocoanut oil is used extensively in toilet soap making, usually in\r\nconnection with tallow. When used alone the soap made from this oil\r\nforms a lather, which comes up rapidly but which is fluffy and dries\r\nquickly. A pure tallow soap lathers very much slower but produces a more\r\nlasting lather. Thus the advantage of using cocoanut oil in soap is\r\nseen. It is further used in making a cocoanut oil soap by the cold\r\nprocess also for \"fake\" or filled soaps. The fatty acid content readily\r\nstarts the saponification which takes place easily with a strong lye\r\n(25deg.-35deg. B.). Where large quantities of the oil are saponified\r\ncare must be exercised as the soap formed suddenly rises or puffs up and\r\nmay boil over. Cocoanut oil soap takes up large quantities of water,\r\ncases having been cited where a 500 per cent. yield has been obtained.\r\nThis water of course dries out again upon exposure to the air. The soap\r\nis harsh to the skin, develops rancidity and darkens readily.\r\n\r\n_Palm Kernel Oil_, which is obtained from the kernels of the palm tree\r\nof West Africa, is used in soap making to replace cocoanut oil where the\r\nlower price warrants its use. It resembles cocoanut oil in respect to\r\nsaponification and in forming a very similar soap. Kernel oil is white\r\nin color, has a pleasant nutty odor when fresh, but rapidly develops\r\nfree acid, which runs to a high percentage.\r\n\r\n_Palm Oil_ is produced from the fruit of the several species of the palm\r\ntree on the western coast of Africa generally, but also in the\r\nPhilippines. The fresh oil has a deep orange yellow tint not destroyed\r\nby saponification, a sweetish taste and an odor of orris root or violet\r\nwhich is also imparted to soap made from it. The methods by which the\r\nnatives obtain the oil are crude and depend upon a fermentation, or\r\nputrefaction. Large quantities are said to be wasted because of this\r\nfact. The oil contains impurities in the form of fermentable fibre and\r\nalbuminous matter, and consequently develops free fatty acid rapidly.\r\nSamples tested for free acid have been found to have hydrolized\r\ncompletely and one seldom obtains an oil with low acid content. Because\r\nof this high percentage of free fatty acid, the glycerine yield is\r\nsmall, though the neutral oil should produce approximately 12 per cent.\r\nglycerine. Some writers claim that glycerine exists in the free state\r\nin palm oil. The writer has washed large quantities of the oil and\r\nanalyzed the wash water for glycerine. The results showed that the\r\namount present did not merit its recovery. Most soap makers do not\r\nattempt to recover the glycerine from this oil, when used alone for soap\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nThere are several grades of palm oil in commerce, but in toilet soap\r\nmaking it is advisable to utilize only Lagos palm oil, which is the best\r\ngrade. Where it is desired to maintain the color of the soap this oil\r\nproduces, a small quantity of the lower or \"brass\" grade of palm oil may\r\nbe used, as the soap made from the better grades of oil gradually\r\nbleaches and loses its orange yellow color.\r\n\r\nPalm oil produces a crumbly soap which cannot readily be milled and is\r\ntermed \"short.\" When used with tallow and cocoanut oil, or 20 to 25 per\r\ncent. cocoanut oil, it produces a very satisfactory toilet soap. In the\r\nsaponification of palm oil it is not advisable to combine it with tallow\r\nin the kettle, as the two do not readily mix.\r\n\r\nSince the finished soap has conveyed to it the orange color of the oil,\r\nthe oil is bleached before saponification. Oxidation readily destroys\r\nthe coloring matter, while heat and light assist materially. The methods\r\ngenerally employed are by the use of oxygen developed by bichromates and\r\nhydrochloric acid and the direct bleaching through the agency of the\r\noxygen of the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHROME BLEACHING OF PALM OIL.\r\n\r\nThe chrome process of bleaching palm oil is more rapid and the oxygen\r\nthus derived being more active will bleach oils which air alone cannot.\r\nIt depends upon the reaction:\r\n\r\n    Na_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} + 8HCl = Cr_{2}Cl_{6} + 2NaCl + 7O.\r\n\r\nin which the oxygen is the active principle. In practice it is found\r\nnecessary to use an excess of acid over that theoretically indicated.\r\n\r\nFor the best results an oil should be chosen containing under 2 per\r\ncent. impurities and a low percentage of free fatty acids. Lagos oil is\r\nbest adapted to these requirements. The oil is melted by open steam from\r\na jet introduced through the bung, the melted oil and condensed water\r\nrunning to the store tank through two sieves (about 1/8 inch mesh) to\r\nremove the fibrous material and gross impurities. The oil thus obtained\r\ncontains fine earthy and fibrous material and vegetable albuminous\r\nmatter which should be removed, as far as possible, since chemicals are\r\nwasted in their oxidation and they retard the bleaching. This is best\r\ndone by boiling the oil for one hour with wet steam and 10 per cent.\r\nsolution of common salt (2 per cent. dry salt on weight of oil used) in\r\na lead-lined or wooden tank. After settling over night the brine and\r\nimpurities are removed by running from a cock at the bottom of the vat\r\nand the oil is run out into the bleaching tank through an oil cock,\r\nsituated about seven inches from the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe bleaching tank is a lead-lined iron tank of the approximate\r\ndimensions of 4 feet deep, 4 feet long and 3-1/2 feet wide, holding\r\nabout 1-1/2 tons. The charge is one ton. A leaden outlet pipe is fixed\r\nat the bottom, to which is attached a rubber tube closed by a screw\r\nclip. A plug also is fitted into the lead outlet pipe from above. Seven\r\ninches above the lower outlet is affixed another tap through which the\r\noil is drawn off.\r\n\r\nThe tank is further equipped with a wet steam coil and a coil arranged\r\nto allow thorough air agitation, both coils being of lead. A good\r\narrangement is to use one coil to deliver either air or steam. These\r\ncoils should extend as nearly as possible over the entire bottom of the\r\ntank and have a number of small downward perforations, so as to spread\r\nthe agitation throughout the mass.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the oil is reduced by passing in air to 110deg. F. and\r\n40 pounds of fine common salt per ton added through a sieve. About\r\none-half of the acid (40 pounds of concentrated commercial hydrochloric\r\nacid) is now poured in and this is followed by the sodium bichromate in\r\nconcentrated solution, previously prepared in a small lead vat or\r\nearthen vessel by dissolving 17 pounds of bichromate in 45 pounds\r\ncommercial hydrochloric acid. This solution should be added slowly and\r\nshould occupy three hours, the whole mass being thoroughly agitated with\r\nair during the addition and for one hour after the last of the bleaching\r\nmixture has been introduced. The whole mixture is now allowed to settle\r\nfor one hour and the exhausted chrome liquors are then run off from the\r\nlower pipe to a waste tank. About 40 gallons of water are now run into\r\nthe bleached oil and the temperature raised by open steam to 150deg. to\r\n160deg. F. The mass is then allowed to settle over night.\r\n\r\nOne such wash is sufficient to remove the spent chrome liquor\r\ncompletely, provided ample time is allowed for settling. A number of\r\nwashings given successively with short periods of settling do not remove\r\nthe chrome liquors effectually. The success of the operation depends\r\nentirely upon the completeness of settling.\r\n\r\nThe wash water is drawn off as before and the clear oil run to storage\r\ntanks or to the soap kettle through the upper oil cock.\r\n\r\nThe waste liquors are boiled with wet steam and the oil skimmed from the\r\nsurface, after which the liquors are run out through an oil trap.\r\n\r\nBy following the above instructions carefully it is possible to bleach\r\none ton of palm oil with 17 pounds of bichromate of soda and 85 pounds\r\nhydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\nThe spent liquors should be a bright green color. Should they be of a\r\nyellow or brownish shade insufficient acid has been allowed and more\r\nmust be added to render the whole of the oxygen available.\r\n\r\nIf low grade oils are being treated more chrome will be necessary, the\r\namount being best judged by conducting the operation as usual and after\r\nthe addition of the bichromate, removing a sample of the oil, washing\r\nthe sample and noting the color of a rapidly cooled sample.\r\n\r\nA little practice will enable the operator to judge the correspondence\r\nbetween the color to be removed and the amount of bleaching mixture to\r\nbe added.\r\n\r\nTo obtain success with this process the method of working given must be\r\nadhered to even in the _smallest detail_. This applies to the\r\ntemperature at which each operation is carried out particularly.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIR BLEACHING OF PALM OIL.\r\n\r\nThe method of conducting this process is identical with the chrome\r\nprocess to the point where the hydrochloric acid is to be added to the\r\noil. In this method no acid or chrome is necessary, as the active\r\nbleaching agent is the oxygen of the air.\r\n\r\nThe equipment is similar to that of the former process, except that a\r\nwooden tank in which no iron is exposed will suffice to bleach the oil\r\nin. The process depends in rapidity upon the amount of air blown through\r\nthe oil and its even distribution. Iron should not be present or exposed\r\nto the oil during bleaching, as it retards the process considerably.\r\n\r\nAfter the impurities have been removed, as outlined under the chrome\r\nprocess, the temperature of the oil is raised by open steam to boiling.\r\nThe steam is then shut off and air allowed to blow through the oil until\r\nit is completely bleached, the temperature being maintained above 150deg.\r\nF. by occasionally passing in steam. Usually a ton of oil is readily and\r\ncompletely bleached after the air has been passed through it for 18 to\r\n20 hours, provided the oil is thoroughly agitated by a sufficient flow\r\nof air.\r\n\r\nIf the oil has been allowed to settle over night, it is advisable to run\r\noff the condensed water and impurities by the lower cock before\r\nagitating again the second day.\r\n\r\nWhen the oil has been bleached to the desired color, which can be\r\ndetermined by removing a sample and cooling, the mass is allowed to\r\nsettle, the water run off to a waste tank from which any oil carried\r\nalong may be skimmed off and the supernatant clear oil run to the\r\nstorage or soap kettle.\r\n\r\nIn bleaching by this process, while the process consumes more time and\r\nis not as efficient in bleaching the lower grade oils, the cost of\r\nbleaching is less and with a good oil success is more probable, as there\r\nis no possibility of any of the chrome liquors being present in the oil.\r\nThese give the bleached oil a green tint when the chrome method is\r\nimproperly conducted and they are not removed.\r\n\r\nInstead of blowing the air through it, the heater oil may be brought\r\ninto contact with the air, either by a paddle wheel arrangement, which,\r\nin constantly turning, brings the oil into contact with the air, or by\r\npumping the heated oil into an elevated vessel, pierced with numerous\r\nfine holes from which the oil continuously flows back into the vessel\r\nfrom which the oil is pumped. While in these methods air, light and heat\r\nact simultaneously in the bleaching of the oil, the equipment required\r\nis too cumbersome to be practical.\r\n\r\nRecent investigations[1] in bleaching palm oil by oxygen have shown that\r\nnot only the coloring matter but the oil itself was affected. In\r\nbleaching palm oil for 30 hours with air the free fatty acid content\r\nrose and titer decreased considerably.\r\n\r\n_Olive Oil_, which comes from the fruit of the olive trees, varies\r\ngreatly in quality, according to the method by which it is obtained and\r\naccording to the tree bearing the fruit. Three hundred varieties are\r\nknown in Italy alone. Since the larger portion of olive oil is used for\r\nedible purposes, a lower grade, denatured oil, denatured because of the\r\ntariff, is used for soap manufacture in this country. The oil varies in\r\ncolor from pale green to golden yellow. The percentage of free acid in\r\nthis oil varies greatly, though the oil does not turn rancid easily. It\r\nis used mainly in the manufacture of white castile soap.\r\n\r\nOlive oil foots, which is the oil extracted by solvents after the better\r\noil is expressed, finds its use in soap making mostly in textile soaps\r\nfor washing and dyeing silks and in the production of green castile\r\nsoaps.\r\n\r\nOther oils, as poppy seed oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, rape oil,\r\npeanut (arachis) oil, are used as adulterants for olive oil, also as\r\nsubstitutes in the manufacture of castile soap, since they are cheaper\r\nthan olive oil.\r\n\r\n_Cottonseed Oil_ is largely used in the manufacture of floating and\r\nlaundry soaps. It may be used for toilet soaps where a white color is\r\nnot desired, as yellow spots appear on a finished soap in which it has\r\nbeen used after having been in stock a short time.\r\n\r\n_Corn Oil and Soya Bean Oil_ are also used to a slight extent in the\r\nmanufacture of toilet soaps, although the oils form a soap of very\r\nlittle body. Their soaps also spot yellow on aging.\r\n\r\nCorn oil finds its greatest use in the manufacture of soap for washing\r\nautomobiles. It is further employed for the manufacture of cheap liquid\r\nsoaps.\r\n\r\n_Fatty Acids_ are also used extensively in soap manufacture. While the\r\nsoap manufacturer prefers to use a neutral oil or fat, since from these\r\nthe by-product glycerine is obtained, circumstances arise where it is\r\nan advantage to use the free fatty acids. Red oil (oleic acid, elaine)\r\nand stearic acid are the two fatty acids most generally bought for soap\r\nmaking. In plants using the Twitchell process, which consists in\r\nsplitting the neutral fats and oils into fatty acids and glycerine by\r\ndilute sulphuric acid and producing their final separation by the use of\r\nso-called aromatic sulphonic acids, these fatty acids consisting of a\r\nmixture of oleic, stearic, palmitic acids, etc., are used directly after\r\nhaving been purified by distillation, the glycerine being obtained from\r\nevaporating the wash water.\r\n\r\nOleic acid (red oil) and stearic acid are obtained usually by the\r\nsaponification of oils, fats and greases by acid, lime or water under\r\npressure or Twitchelling. The fatty acids thus are freed from their\r\ncombination with glycerine and solidify upon cooling, after which they\r\nare separated from the water and pressed at a higher or lower\r\ntemperature. The oleic acid, being liquid at ordinary temperature,\r\ntogether with some stearic and palmitic acid, is thus pressed out. These\r\nlatter acids are usually separated by distillation, combined with the\r\npress cake further purified and sold as stearic acid.\r\n\r\nThe red oil, sometimes called saponified red oil, is often semi-solid,\r\nresembling a soft tallow, due to the presence of stearic acid. The\r\ndistilled oils are usually clear, varying in color from light to a deep\r\nbrown. Stearic acid, which reaches the trade in slab form, varies in\r\nquality from a soft brown, greasy, crumbly solid of unpleasant odor to a\r\nsnow white, wax-like, hard, odorless mass. The quality of stearic acid\r\nis best judged by the melting point, since the presence of any oleic\r\nacid lowers this. The melting point of the varieties used in soap\r\nmanufacture usually ranges from 128deg. to 132deg. F. Red oil is used in\r\nthe manufacture of textile soaps, replacing olive oil foots soap for\r\nthis purpose, chlorophyll being used to color the soap green. Stearic\r\nacid, being the hard firm fatty acid, may be used in small quantities to\r\ngive a better grade of soap body and finish. In adding this substance it\r\nshould always be done in the crutcher, as it will not mix in the kettle.\r\nIt finds its largest use for soap, however, in the manufacture of\r\nshaving soaps and shaving creams, since it produces the non-drying\r\ncreamy lather so greatly desired for this purpose. Both red oil and\r\nstearic acid being fatty acids, readily unite with the alkali\r\ncarbonates, carbon dioxide being formed in the reaction and this method\r\nis extensively used in the formation of soap from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nRANCIDITY OF OILS AND FATS.\r\n\r\nRancidity in neutral oils and fats is one of the problems the soap\r\nmanufacturer has to contend with. The mere saying that an oil is rancid\r\nis no indication of its being high in free acid. The two terms rancidity\r\nand acidity are usually allied. Formerly, the acidity of a fat was\r\nlooked upon as the direct measure of its rancidity. This idea is still\r\nprevalent in practice and cannot be too often stated as incorrect. Fats\r\nand oils may be _acid_, or _rancid_, or _acid and rancid_. In an acid\r\nfat there has been a hydrolysis of the fat and it has developed a rather\r\nhigh percentage of free acid. A rancid fat is one in which have been\r\ndeveloped compounds of an odoriferous nature. An acid and rancid fat is\r\none in which both free acid and organic compounds of the well known\r\ndisagreeable odors have been produced.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be definitely stated just how this rancidity takes place, any\r\nmore than just what are the chemical products causing rancidity. The\r\nonly conclusion that one may draw is that the fats are first hydrolyzed\r\nor split up into glycerine and free fatty acids. This is followed by an\r\noxidation of the products thus formed.\r\n\r\nMoisture, air, light, enzymes (organized ferments) and bacteria are all\r\ngiven as causes of rancidity.\r\n\r\nIt seems very probable that the initial splitting of the fats is caused\r\nby enzymes, which are present in the seeds and fruits of the vegetable\r\noils and tissue of animal fats, in the presence of moisture. Lewkowitsch\r\nstrongly emphasizes this point and he is substantiated in his idea by\r\nother authorities. Others hold that bacteria or micro-organisms are the\r\ncause of this hydrolysis, citing the fact that they have isolated\r\nvarious micro-organisms from various fats and oils. The acceptance of\r\nthe bacterial action would explain the various methods of preservation\r\nof oils and fats by the use of antiseptic preparations. It cannot,\r\nhowever, be accepted as a certainty that bacteria cause the rancidity of\r\nfats.\r\n\r\nThe action of enzymes is a more probable explanation.\r\n\r\nThe hydrolysis of fats and oils is accelerated when they are allowed to\r\nremain for some time in the presence of organic non-fats. Thus, palm\r\noil, lower grades of olive oil, and tallow, which has been in contact\r\nwith the animal tissue for a long time, all contain other nitrogenous\r\nmatter and exhibit a larger percentage of free fatty acid than the oils\r\nand fats not containing such impurities.\r\n\r\nGranting this initial splitting of the fat into free fatty acids and\r\nglycerine, this is not a sufficient explanation. The products thus\r\nformed must be acted upon by air and light. It is by the action of these\r\nagents that there is a further action upon the products, and from this\r\noxidation we ascertain by taste and smell (chemical means are still\r\nunable to define rancidity) whether or not a fat is rancid. While some\r\nauthorities have presumed to isolate some of these products causing\r\nrancidity, we can only assume the presence of the various possible\r\ncompounds produced by the action of air and light which include oxy\r\nfatty acids, lactones, alcohols, esters, aldehydes and other products.\r\n\r\nThe soap manufacturer is interested in rancidity to the extent of the\r\neffect upon the finished soap. Rancid fats form darker soaps than fats\r\nin the neutral state, and very often carry with them the disagreeable\r\nodor of a rancid oil. Further, a rancid fat or oil is usually high in\r\nfree acid. It is by no means true, however, that rancidity is a measure\r\nfor acidity, for as has already been pointed out, an oil may be rancid\r\nand not high in free acid.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of free fatty acid is of even greater importance in the\r\nsoap industry. The amount of glycerine yield is dependent upon the\r\npercentage of free fatty acid and is one of the criterions of a good fat\r\nor oil for soap stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTION OF RANCIDITY.\r\n\r\nSince moisture, air, light and enzymes, produced by the presence of\r\norganic impurities, are necessary for the rancidity of a fat or oil, the\r\nmethods of preventing rancidity are given. Complete dryness, complete\r\npurification of fats and oils and storage without access of air or light\r\nare desirable. Simple as these means may seem, they can only be\r\napproximated in practice. The most difficult problem is the removal of\r\nthe last trace of moisture. Impurities may be lessened very often by the\r\nuse of greater care. In storing it is well to store in closed barrels or\r\nclosed iron tanks away from light, as it has been observed that oils and\r\nfats in closed receptacles become rancid less rapidly than those in open\r\nones, even though this method of storing is only partially attained.\r\nPreservatives are also used, but only in edible products, where their\r\neffectiveness is an open question.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL CONSTANTS OF OILS AND FATS.\r\n\r\nBesides the various physical properties of oils and fats, such as\r\ncolor, specific gravity, melting point, solubility, etc., they may be\r\ndistinguished chemically by a number of chemical constants. These are\r\nthe iodine number, the acetyl value, saponification number,\r\nReichert-Meissl number for volatile acids, Hehner number for insoluble\r\nacids. These constants, while they vary somewhat with any particular oil\r\nor fat, are more applicable to the edible products and are criterions\r\nwhere any adulteration of fat or oil is suspected. The methods of\r\ncarrying out the analyses of oils and fats to obtain these constants are\r\ngiven in the various texts[2] on oils and fats, and inasmuch as they are\r\nnot of great importance to the soap industry they are merely mentioned\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nOIL HARDENING OR HYDROGENATING.\r\n\r\nIt is very well known that oils and fats vary in consistency and\r\nhardness, depending upon the glycerides forming same. Olein, a\r\ncombination of oleic acid and glycerine, as well as oleic acid itself\r\nlargely forms the liquid portion of oils and fats. Oleic acid\r\n(C_{18}H_{34}O_{2}) is an unsaturated acid and differs from stearic acid\r\n(C_{18}H_{36}O_{2}), the acid forming the hard firm portion of oils and\r\nfats, by containing two atoms of hydrogen less in the molecule.\r\nTheoretically it should be a simple matter to introduce two atoms of\r\nhydrogen into oleic acid or olein, and by this mere addition convert\r\nliquid oleic acid and olein into solid stearic acid and stearine.\r\n\r\nFor years this was attempted and all attempts to apply the well known\r\nmethods of reduction (addition of hydrogen) in organic chemistry, such\r\nas treatment with tin and acid, sodium amalgam, etc., were unsuccessful.\r\nIn recent years, however, it has been discovered that in the presence of\r\na catalyzer, nickel in finely divided form or the oxides of nickel are\r\nusually employed, the process of hydrogenating an oil is readily\r\nattained upon a practical basis.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of hardened oils has opened a new source of raw\r\nmaterial for the soap manufacturer in that it is now possible to use\r\noils in soap making which were formerly discarded because of their\r\nundesirable odors. Thus fish or train oils which had up to the time of\r\noil hydrogenating resisted all attempts of being permanently deodorized,\r\ncan now be employed very satisfactorily for soap manufacture. A Japanese\r\nchemist, Tsujimoto[3] has shown that fish oils contain an unsaturated\r\nacid of the composition C_{18}H_{28}O_{2}, for which he proposed the\r\nname clupanodonic acid. By the catalytic hardening of train oils this\r\nacid passes to stearic acid and the problem of deodorizing these oils is\r\nsolved.[4]\r\n\r\nAt first the introduction of hardened oils for soap manufacture met with\r\nnumerous objections, due to the continual failures of obtaining a\r\nsatisfactory product by the use of same. Various attempts have now shown\r\nthat these oils, particularly hardened train oils, produce\r\nextraordinarily useful materials for soap making. These replace\r\nexpensive tallow and other high melting oils. It is of course impossible\r\nto employ hardened oils alone, as a soap so hard would thus be obtained\r\nthat it would be difficultly soluble in water and possess very little\r\nlathering quality. By the addition of 20-25% of tallow oil or some other\r\noil forming a soft soap a very suitable soap for household use may be\r\nobtained. Ribot[5] discusses this matter fully. Hardened oils readily\r\nsaponify, may be perfumed without any objections and do not impart any\r\nfishy odor to an article washed with same. Meyerheim[6] states that\r\nthrough the use of hydrogenated oils the hardness of soap is\r\nextraordinarily raised, so that soap made from hardened cottonseed oil\r\nis twelve times as hard as the soap made from ordinary cottonseed oil.\r\nThis soap is also said to no longer spot yellow upon aging, and as a\r\nconsequence of its hardness, is able to contain a considerably higher\r\ncontent of rosin through which lathering power and odor may be improved.\r\nHardened oils can easily be used for toilet soap bases, provided they\r\nare not added in too great a percentage.\r\n\r\nThe use of hardened oils is not yet general, but there is little doubt\r\nthat the introduction of this process goes a long way toward solving the\r\nproblem of cheaper soap material for the soap making industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREASE.\r\n\r\nGrease varies so greatly in composition and consistency that it can\r\nhardly be classed as a distinctive oil or fat. It is obtained from\r\nrefuse, bones, hides, etc., and while it contains the same constituents\r\nas tallow, the olein content is considerably greater, which causes it to\r\nbe more liquid in composition. Grease differs in color from an off-white\r\nto a dark brown. The better qualities are employed in the manufacture of\r\nlaundry and chip soap, while the poorer qualities are only fit for the\r\ncheapest of soaps used in scrubbing floors and such purposes. There is\r\nusually found in grease a considerable amount of gluey matter, lime and\r\nwater. The percentage of free fatty acid is generally high.\r\n\r\nThe darker grades of grease are bleached before being used. This is done\r\nby adding a small quantity of sodium nitrate to the melted grease and\r\nagitating, then removing the excess saltpeter by decomposing with\r\nsulphuric acid. A better method of refining, however, is by\r\ndistillation. The chrome bleach is also applicable.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSIN (COLOPHONY, YELLOW ROSIN, RESINA).\r\n\r\nRosin is the residue which remains after the distillation of turpentine\r\nfrom the various species of pines. The chief source of supply is in the\r\nStates of Georgia North and South Carolina. It is a transparent, amber\r\ncolored hard pulverizable resin. The better grades are light in color\r\nand known as water white (w. w.) and window glass (w. g.). These are\r\nobtained from a tree which has been tapped for the first year. As the\r\nsame trees are tapped from year to year, the product becomes deeper and\r\ndarker in color until it becomes almost black.\r\n\r\nThe constituents of rosin are chiefly (80-90%) abietic acid or its\r\nanhydride together with pinic and sylvic acids. Its specific gravity is\r\n1.07-1.08, melting point about 152.5 C., and it is soluble in alcohol,\r\nether, benzine, carbon disulfide, oils, alkalis and acetic acid. The\r\nmain use of rosin, outside of the production of varnishes, is in the\r\nproduction of laundry soaps, although a slight percentage acts as a\r\nbinder and fixative for perfumes in toilet soaps and adds to their\r\ndetergent properties. Since it is mainly composed of acids, it readily\r\nunites with alkaline carbonates, though the saponification is not quite\r\ncomplete and the last portion must be completed through the use of\r\ncaustic hydrates, unless an excess of 10% carbonate over the theoretical\r\namount is used. A lye of 20deg. B. is best adapted to the saponification of\r\nrosin when caustic hydrates are employed for this purpose, since weak\r\nlyes cause frothing. While it is sometimes considered that rosin is an\r\nadulterant for soap, this is hardly justifiable, as it adds to the\r\ncleansing properties of soap. Soaps containing rosin are of the well\r\nknown yellowish color common to ordinary laundry soaps. The price of\r\nrosin has so risen in the last few years that it presents a problem of\r\ncost to the soap manufacturer considering the price at which laundry\r\nsoaps are sold.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSIN SAPONIFICATION.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, rosin may be saponified by the use of alkaline\r\ncarbonates. On account of the possibility of the soap frothing over, the\r\nkettle in which the operation takes place should be set flush with the\r\nfloor, which ought to be constructed of cement. The kettle itself is an\r\nopen one with round bottom, equipped with an open steam coil and skimmer\r\npipe, and the open portion is protected by a semi-circular rail. A\r\npowerful grid, having a 3-inch mesh, covers one-half of the kettle, the\r\nsharp edges protruding upwards.\r\n\r\nThe staves from the rosin casks are removed at the edge of the kettle,\r\nthe rosin placed on the grid and beaten through with a hammer to break\r\nit up into small pieces.\r\n\r\nTo saponify a ton of rosin there are required 200 lbs. soda ash, 1,600\r\nlbs. water and 100 lbs. salt. Half the water is run into the kettle,\r\nboiled, and then the soda ash and half the salt added. The rosin is now\r\nadded through the grid and the mixture thoroughly boiled. As carbon\r\ndioxide is evolved by the reaction the boiling is continued for one hour\r\nto remove any excess of this gas. A portion of the salt is gradually\r\nadded to grain the soap well and to keep the mass in such condition as\r\nto favor the evolution of gas. The remainder of the water is added to\r\nclose the soap and boiling continued for one or two hours longer. At\r\nthis point the kettle must be carefully watched or it will boil over\r\nthrough the further escape of carbon dioxide being hindered. The mass,\r\nbeing in a frothy condition, will rapidly settle by controlling the flow\r\nof steam. The remaining salt is then scattered in and the soap allowed\r\nto settle for two hours or longer. The lyes are then drained off the\r\ntop. If the rosin soap is required for toilet soaps, it is grained a\r\nsecond time. The soap is now boiled with the water caused by the\r\ncondensation of the steam, which changes it to a half grained soap\r\nsuitable for pumping. A soap thus made contains free soda ash 0.15% or\r\nless, free rosin about 15%. The mass is then pumped to the kettle\r\ncontaining the soap to which it is to be added at the proper stage. The\r\ntime consumed in thus saponifying rosin is about five hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPHTHENIC ACIDS.\r\n\r\nThe naphtha or crude petroleum of the various provinces in Europe, as\r\nRussia, Galacia, Alsace and Roumania yield a series of bodies of acid\r\ncharacter upon refining which are designated under the general name of\r\nnaphthenic acids. These acids are retained in solution in the alkaline\r\nlyes during the distillation of the naphtha in the form of alkaline\r\nnaphthenates. Upon adding dilute sulphuric acid to these lyes the\r\nnaphthenates are decomposed and the naphthenic acids float to the\r\nsurface in an oily layer of characteristic disagreeable odor and varying\r\nfrom yellow to brown in color[7]. In Russia particularly large\r\nquantities of these acids are employed in the manufacture of soap.\r\n\r\nThe soaps formed from naphthenic acids have recently been\r\ninvestigated[8] and found to resemble the soaps made from cocoanut oil\r\nand palm kernel oil, in that they are difficult to salt out and\r\ndissociate very slightly with water. The latter property makes them\r\nvaluable in textile industries when a mild soap is required as a\r\ndetergent, e. g., in the silk industry. These soaps also possess a high\r\nsolvent power for mineral oils and emulsify very readily. The mean\r\nmolecular weight of naphthenic acids themselves is very near that of the\r\nfatty acids contained in cocoanut oil, and like those of cocoanut oil a\r\nportion of the separated acids are volatile with steam. The iodine\r\nnumber indicates a small content of unsaturated acids.\r\n\r\nThat naphthenic acids are a valuable soap material is now recognized,\r\nbut except in Russia the soap is not manufactured to any extent at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALIS.\r\n\r\nThe common alkali metals which enter into the formation of soap are\r\nsodium and potassium. The hydroxides of these metals are usually used,\r\nexcept in the so called carbonate saponification of free fatty acids in\r\nwhich case sodium and potassium carbonate are used. A water solution of\r\nthe caustic alkalis is known as lye, and it is as lyes of various\r\nstrengths that they are added to oils and fats to form soap. The density\r\nor weight of a lye is considerably greater than that of water, depending\r\nupon the amount of alkali dissolved, and its weight is usually\r\ndetermined by a hydrometer. This instrument is graduated by a\r\nstandardized scale, and while all hydrometers should read alike in a\r\nliquid of known specific gravity, this is generally not the case, so\r\nthat it is advisable to check a new hydrometer for accurate work against\r\none of known accuracy. In this country the Baume scale has been adopted,\r\nwhile in England a different graduation known as the Twaddle scale is\r\nused. The strength of a lye or any solution is determined by the\r\ndistance the instrument sinks into the solution, and we speak of the\r\nstrength of a solution as so many degrees Baume or Twaddle which are\r\nread to the point where the meniscus of the lye comes on the graduated\r\nscale. Hydrometers are graduated differently for liquids of different\r\nweights. In the testing of lyes one which is graduated from 0deg. to\r\n50deg. B. is usually employed.\r\n\r\n_Caustic soda_ is received by the consumer in iron drums weighing\r\napproximately 700 lbs. each. The various grades are designated as 60,\r\n70, 74, 76 and 77%. These percentages refer to the percentage of sodium\r\noxide (Na_{2}O) in 100 parts of pure caustic soda formed by the\r\ncombination of 77-1/2 parts of sodium oxide and 22-1/2 parts of water,\r\n77-1/2% being chemically pure caustic soda. There are generally\r\nimpurities present in commercial caustic soda. These consist of sodium\r\ncarbonate, sodium chloride or common salt and sometimes lime. It is\r\nmanufactured by treating sodium carbonate in an iron vessel with calcium\r\nhydroxide or slaked lime, or by electrolysis of common salt. The latter\r\nprocess has yet been unable to compete with the former in price.\r\nFormerly all the caustic soda used in soap making was imported, and it\r\nwas only through the American manufacturer using a similar container to\r\nthat used by foreign manufacturers that they were able to introduce\r\ntheir product. This prejudice has now been entirely overcome and most of\r\nthe caustic soda used in this country is manufactured here.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSTIC POTASH.\r\n\r\nThe output of the salts containing potassium is controlled almost\r\nentirely by Germany. Formerly the chief source of supply of potassium\r\ncompounds was from the burned ashes of plants, but about fifty years ago\r\nthe inexhaustible salt mines of Stassfurt, Germany, were discovered.\r\nThe salt there mined contains, besides the chlorides and sulphates of\r\nsodium, magnesium, calcium and other salts, considerable quantities of\r\npotassium chloride, and the Stassfurt mines at present are practically\r\nthe entire source of all potassium compounds, in spite of the fact that\r\nother localities have been sought to produce these compounds on a\r\ncommercial basis, especially by the United States government.\r\n\r\nAfter separating the potassium chloride from the magnesium chloride and\r\nother substances found in Stassfurt salts the methods of manufacture of\r\ncaustic potash are identical to those of caustic soda. In this case,\r\nhowever, domestic electrolytic caustic potash may be purchased cheaper\r\nthan the imported product and it gives results equal to those obtained\r\nby the use of the imported article, opinions to the contrary among soap\r\nmakers being many. Most of the caustic potash in the United States is\r\nmanufactured at Niagara Falls by the Niagara Alkali Co., and the Hooker\r\nElectrochemical Co., chlorine being obtained as a by-product. The latter\r\nconcern employs the Townsend Cell, for the manufacture of electrolytic\r\npotash, and are said to have a capacity for making 64 tons of alkali\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nSince the molecular weight of caustic potash (56) is greater than that\r\nof caustic soda (40) more potash is required to saponify a pound of fat.\r\nThe resulting potash soap is correspondingly heavier than a soda soap.\r\nWhen salt is added to a potassium soap double decomposition occurs, the\r\npotassium soap being transformed to a sodium soap and the potassium\r\nuniting with the chlorine to form potassium chloride. This was one of\r\nthe earliest methods of making a hard soap, especially in Germany, where\r\npotash was derived from leeching ashes of burned wood and plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nSODIUM CARBONATE (SODA ASH).\r\n\r\nWhile carbonate of soda is widely distributed in nature the source of\r\nsupply is entirely dependent upon the manufactured product. Its uses are\r\nmany, but it is especially important to the soap industry in the so\r\ncalled carbonate saponification of free fatty acids, as a constituent of\r\nsoap powders, in the neutralization of glycerine lyes and as a filler\r\nfor laundry soaps.\r\n\r\nThe old French Le Blanc soda process, which consists in treating common\r\nsalt with sulphuric acid and reducing the sodium sulphate (salt cake)\r\nthus formed with carbon in the form of charcoal or coke to sodium\r\nsulphide, which when treated with calcium carbonate yields a mixture of\r\ncalcium sulphide and sodium carbonate (black ash) from which the\r\ncarbonate is dissolved by water, has been replaced by the more recent\r\nSolvay ammonia soda process. Even though there is a considerable loss of\r\nsalt and the by-product calcium chloride produced by this process is\r\nonly partially used up as a drying agent, and for refrigerating\r\npurposes, the Le Blanc process cannot compete with the Solvay process,\r\nso that the time is not far distant when the former will be considered a\r\nchemical curiosity. In the Solvay method of manufacture sodium chloride\r\n(common salt) and ammonium bicarbonate are mixed in solution. Double\r\ndecomposition occurs with the formation of ammonium chloride and sodium\r\nbicarbonate. The latter salt is comparatively difficultly soluble in\r\nwater and crystallizes out, the ammonium chloride remaining in solution.\r\nWhen the sodium bicarbonate is heated it yields sodium carbonate, carbon\r\ndioxide and water; the carbon dioxide is passed into ammonia which is\r\nset free from the ammonium chloride obtained as above by treatment with\r\nlime (calcium oxide) calcium chloride being the by-product.\r\n\r\nSal soda or washing soda is obtained by recrystallizing a solution of\r\nsoda ash in water. Large crystals of sal soda containing but 37% sodium\r\ncarbonate are formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTASSIUM CARBONATE.\r\n\r\nPotassium carbonate is not extensively used in the manufacture of soap.\r\nIt may be used in the forming of soft soaps by uniting it with free\r\nfatty acids. The methods of manufacture are the same as for sodium\r\ncarbonate, although a much larger quantity of potassium carbonate than\r\ncarbonate of soda is obtained from burned plant ashes. Purified\r\npotassium carbonate is known as _pearl ash_.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL MATERIAL USED IN SOAP MAKING.\r\n\r\nWater is indispensable to the soap manufacturer. In the soap factory\r\n_hard_ water is often the cause of much trouble. Water, which is the\r\nbest solvent known, in passing through the crevices of rocks dissolves\r\nsome of the constituents of these, and the water is known as hard. This\r\nhardness is of two kinds, _temporary_ and _permanent_. Temporarily hard\r\nwater is formed by water, which contains carbonic acid, dissolving a\r\nportion of calcium carbonate or carbonate of lime. Upon boiling, the\r\ncarbonic acid is driven from the water and the carbonate, being\r\ninsoluble in carbon dioxide free water, is deposited. This is the cause\r\nof boiler scale, and to check this a small amount of sal ammoniac may be\r\nadded to the water, which converts the carbonate into soluble calcium\r\nchloride and volatile ammonium carbonate. Permanent hardness is caused\r\nby calcium sulphate which is soluble in 400 parts of water and cannot be\r\nremoved by boiling.\r\n\r\nThe presence of these salts in water form insoluble lime soaps which act\r\nas inert bodies as far as their value for the common use of soap is\r\nconcerned. Where the percentage of lime in water is large this should be\r\nremoved. A method generally used is to add about 5% of 20deg. B. sodium\r\nsilicate to the hard water. This precipitates the lime and the water is\r\nthen sufficiently pure to use.\r\n\r\n_Salt_, known as sodium chloride, is used to a large extent in soap\r\nmaking for \"salting out\" the soap during saponification, as well as\r\ngraining soaps. Soap ordinarily soluble in water is insoluble in a salt\r\nsolution, use of which is made by adding salt to the soap which goes\r\ninto solution and throws any soap dissolved in the lyes out of solution.\r\nSalt may contain magnesium and calcium chlorides, which of course are\r\nundesirable in large amounts. The products on the market, however, are\r\nsatisfactory, thus no detail is necessary.\r\n\r\n_Filling materials_ used are sodium silicate, or water glass, talc,\r\nsilex, pumice, starch, borax, tripoli, etc.\r\n\r\nBesides these other materials are used in the refining of the oils and\r\nfats, and glycerine recovery, such as Fuller's earth, bichromates of\r\nsoda or potash, sulphate of alumina, sulphuric and hydrochloric acids\r\nand alcohol.\r\n\r\nA lengthy description of these substances is not given, as their modes\r\nof use are detailed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Seifensieder Zeit, 1913, 40, p. 687, 724, 740.\r\n\r\n[2] Official Methods, see Bull. 107, A.

The specifications for a soap factory to be erected or remodeled\r\nmust suit the particular cases. Very often a building which was\r\nconstructed for a purpose other than soap manufacture must be adapted\r\nfor the production of soap. In either case it is a question of\r\nengineering and architecture, together with the knowledge obtained in\r\npractice and the final decision as to the arrangement is best solved by\r\na conference with those skilled in each of these branches.\r\n\r\nAn ideal soap plant is one in which the process of soap making, from the\r\nmelting out of the stock to the packing and shipping of the finished\r\nproduct, moves downward from floor to floor, since by this method it is\r\npossible to utilize gravitation rather than pumping liquid fats and\r\nfluid soaps. Convenience and economy are obtained by such an\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThe various machinery and other equipment for soap manufacture are well\r\nknown to those connected with this industry. It varies, of course,\r\ndepending upon the kind of soap to be manufactured, and full\r\ndescriptions of the necessary machinery are best given in the catalogs\r\nissued by the manufacturers of such equipment, who in this country are\r\nmost reliable.\r\n\r\nTo know just what equipment is necessary can very easily be described by\r\na brief outline of the process various soaps undergo to produce the\r\nfinished article. After the saponification has taken place in the _soap\r\nkettle_ the molten soap is run directly into the soap _frames_, which\r\nconsist of an oblong compartment, holding anywhere from 400 to 1,200\r\npounds, with removable steel sides and mounted upon trucks, in which it\r\nsolidifies. In most cases it is advisable to first run the soap into a\r\n_crutcher_ or mixer which produces a more homogeneous mass than if this\r\noperation is omitted. Color and perfume may also be added at this point,\r\nalthough when a better grade of perfume is added it must be remembered\r\nthat there is considerable loss due to volatilization of same. When a\r\n_drying machine_ is employed the molten soap is run directly upon the\r\nrollers of this machine, later adding about 1.0% zinc oxide to the soap\r\nfrom which it passes continuously through the drying chamber and is\r\nemitted in chip form ready for milling. After the soap has been framed,\r\nit is allowed to cool and solidify, which takes several days, and then\r\nthe sides of the frame are stripped off. The large solid cake is cut\r\nwith wires by hand or by a _slabber_ into slabs of any desired size.\r\nThese slabs are further divided into smaller divisions by the _cutting\r\ntable_. In non-milled soaps (laundry soaps, floating soaps, etc.), these\r\nare pressed at this stage, usually by automatic presses, after a thin\r\nhard film has been formed over the cake by allowing it to dry slightly.\r\nIn making these soaps they are not touched by hand at any time during\r\nthe operation, the pressing, wrapping and packing all being done by\r\nmachinery. For a milled soap the large slabs are cut into narrow oblong\r\nshapes by means of the cutting table to readily pass into the feeder of\r\nthe _chipper_, the chips being spread upon _trays_ and dried in a _dry\r\nhouse_ until the moisture content is approximately 15%.\r\n\r\nThe process of milling is accomplished by passing the dried soap chips\r\nthrough a _soap mill_, which is a machine consisting of usually three or\r\nfour contiguous, smooth, granite rollers operated by a system of gears\r\nand set far enough apart to allow the soap to pass from a hopper to the\r\nfirst roller, from which it is constantly conveyed to each succeeding\r\nroller as a thin film, and finally scraped from the last roller to fall\r\ninto the _milling box_ in thin ribbon form. These mills are often\r\noperated in tandem, which necessitates less handling of soap by the\r\noperator. The object of milling is to give the soap a glossy, smooth\r\nfinish and to blend it into a homogeneous mass. The perfume, color,\r\nmedication or any other material desired are added to the dried soap\r\nchips prior to milling. Some manufacturers use an _amalgamator_ to\r\ndistribute these uniformly through the soap, which eliminates at least\r\none milling. When a white soap is being put through the mill, it is\r\nadvisable to add from 0.5% to 1% of a good, fine quality of zinc oxide\r\nto the soap, if this substance has not been previously added. This\r\nserves to remove the yellowish cast and any translucency occasioned by\r\nplodding. Too great a quantity of this compound added, later exhibits\r\nitself by imparting to the soap a dead white appearance. Inasmuch as the\r\nmilling process is one upon which the appearance of a finished cake of\r\ntoilet soap largely depends, it should be carefully done. The number of\r\ntimes a soap should be milled depends upon the character of a soap being\r\nworked. It should of course be the object to mill with as high a\r\npercentage of moisture as possible. Should the soap become too dry it is\r\nadvisable to add water directly, rather than wet soap, since water can\r\nmore easily be distributed through the mass. As a general statement it\r\nmay be said it is better policy to overmill a soap, rather than not mill\r\nit often enough.\r\n\r\nAfter the soap has been thoroughly milled it is ready for plodding. A\r\n_plodder_ is so constructed as to take the soap ribbons fed into the\r\nhopper by means of a worm screw and continuously force it under great\r\npressure through a jacketed cylinder through which cold water circulates\r\nin the rear to compensate the heat produced by friction and hot water at\r\nthe front, to soften and polish the soap which passes out in solid form\r\nin bars of any shape and size depending upon the form of the _shaping\r\nplate_ through which it is emitted. The bars run upon a _roller board_,\r\nare cut into the required length by a special _cake cutting table_,\r\nallowed to dry slightly and pressed either automatically or by a foot\r\npower _press_ in any suitable soap _die_. The finished cake is then\r\nready for wrapping and after due time in stock reaches the consumer.\r\n\r\nBesides the various apparatus mentioned above there are many other parts\r\nfor the full equipment of a modern soap plant, such as remelters, pumps,\r\nmixers, special tanks, power equipment, etc. As has been stated,\r\nhowever, practical experience will aid in judging the practicability as\r\nto installation of these. The various methods of powdering soap are,\r\nhowever, not generally known. Where a coarse powder is to be produced,\r\nsuch as is used for common washing powders, no great difficulty is\r\nexperienced with the well known Blanchard mill. In grinding soap to an\r\nimpalpable powder the difficulties increase. The methods adapted in\r\npulverizing soaps are by means of disintegrators, pebble mills and\r\nchaser mills. The disintegrator grinds by the principle of attrition,\r\nthat is, the material is reduced by the particles being caused to beat\r\nagainst each other at great velocity; a pebble mill crushes the\r\nsubstance by rubbing it between hard pebbles in a slowly revolving\r\ncylinder; the chaser mill first grinds the material and then floats it\r\nas a very fine powder above a curb of fixed height. The last method is\r\nparticularly adapted for the finest of powder (140 mesh and over).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nClassification of Soap-Making Methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the saponification of fats and oils to form soap through the agency\r\nof caustic alkalis, as has been stated, the sodium or potassium salts of\r\nthe mixed fatty acids are formed. Sodium soaps are usually termed hard\r\nsoaps, and potassium soaps soft. There are, however, a great many\r\nvarieties of soaps the appearance and properties of which depend upon\r\ntheir method of manufacture and the oils or fats used therein.\r\n\r\nThe various methods adopted in soap making may be thus classified:\r\n\r\n1. Boiling the fats and oils in open kettles by open steam with\r\nindefinite quantities of caustic alkali solutions until the finished\r\nsoap is obtained; ordinarily named _full boiled soaps_. These may be\r\nsub-divided into (a) hard soaps with sodium hydrate as a base, in which\r\nthe glycerine is recovered from the spent lyes; (b) hard soaps with soda\r\nas a base, in which the glycerine remains in the soap, e. g., marine\r\ncocoanut oil soaps; (c) soft potash soaps, in which the glycerine is\r\nretained by the soap.\r\n\r\n2. Combining the required amount of lye for complete saponification of a\r\nfat therewith, heating slightly with dry heat and then allowing the\r\nsaponification to complete itself. This is known as the _cold process_.\r\n\r\n3. Utilizing the fatty acid, instead of the neutral fat, and combining\r\nit directly with caustic alkali or carbonate, which is incorrectly\r\ntermed _carbonate saponification_, since it is merely neutralizing the\r\nfree fatty acid and thus is not a saponification in the true sense of\r\nthe word. No glycerine is directly obtained by this method, as it is\r\nusually previously removed in the clearage of the fat by either the\r\nTwitchell or autoclave saponification method.\r\n\r\nIn the methods thus outlined the one most generally employed is the full\r\nboiled process to form a sodium soap. This method of making soap\r\nrequires close attention and a knowledge which can only be obtained by\r\nconstant practice. The stock, strength of lyes, heat, amount of salt or\r\nbrine added, time of settling, etc., are all influencing factors.\r\n\r\nThe principles involved in this process are briefly these:\r\n\r\nThe fat is partly saponified with weak lyes (usually those obtained from\r\na previous boiling in the strengthening change are used), and salt is\r\nadded to grain the soap. The mass is then allowed to settle into two\r\nlayers. The upper layer is partly saponified fat; the lower layer, or\r\nspent lye, is a solution of salt, glycerine, and contains any albuminous\r\nmatter or any other impurity contained in the fat. This is known as the\r\n_killing_ or glycerine change. Strong lyes are now added and the fat\r\nentirely saponified, which is termed the _strengthening change_. The\r\nmass is then allowed to settle and the fluid soap run off above the\r\n\"nigre.\" This operation is called the finish or _finishing_ change.\r\n\r\nThe method may be more fully illustrated by a concrete example of the\r\nmethod of manufacture of a tallow base:\r\n\r\n    Charge--\r\n\r\n    Tallow              88 per cent.\r\n    Cocoanut oil        10 per cent.\r\n    Rosin w. w.          2 per cent.\r\n\r\n        Amount charge   10 tons\r\n\r\nAbout five tons of tallow and one ton of cocoanut oil are pumped or run\r\ninto the soap kettle and brought to a boil with wet steam until it\r\nbriskly comes through the hot fat. The caustic soda (strengthening lyes\r\nfrom former boilings may be used here) is gradually added by the\r\ndistributing pipe, any tendency to thicken being checked by the\r\nintroduction of small quantities of brine (\"salt pickle\"). If the lye is\r\nadded too rapidly the soap assumes a granular appearance, indicating\r\nthat the addition of same must be discontinued. Water should then be\r\nadded and the mass boiled through until it again closes. When the\r\naddition of the proper amount of caustic soda is nearing its completion\r\nthe soap gradually thins. The steam is now cut down to about one turn of\r\nthe valve, and brine is rapidly added or salt shoveled in. In ten to\r\nfifteen minutes the steam again breaks through and, from the appearance\r\nof the soap, it can be seen whether sufficient brine has been added. A\r\nsample taken out by means of a long wooden paddle should show the soap\r\nin fine grains with the lyes running from it clear. The steam is then\r\nshut off and the soap allowed to settle from one and one-half to two\r\nhours. In all settlings the longer time this operation is permitted to\r\ncontinue, the better will the subsequent operations proceed.\r\n\r\nThe mixture now consists of a partly saponified layer of fat above the\r\nspent lyes. The lyes are drawn off until soap makes its appearance at\r\nthe exit pipe. The valve is then closed and the soap blown back into the\r\nkettle by steam. The lyes thus obtained are known as _spent lyes_, from\r\nwhich the glycerine is recovered. They should show an alkalinity of\r\napproximately 0.5 per cent. if the operation is carefully carried out.\r\n\r\nThe remaining tallow is now added and the above operations repeated.\r\n\r\nAfter the spent lyes have been drawn off, the soap is closed with water\r\nand the proper percentage of rosin soap previously formed, or rosin\r\nitself is added to the mass in the kettle. More lye is then allowed to\r\nflow in until the mixture is up to \"strength.\" This is usually tested\r\nby the \"bite\" on the tongue of a small cooled sample. After boiling\r\nuntil the steam comes through, the mass is grained with salt as before\r\nand allowed to settle one and one-half to three hours. These lyes, known\r\nas _strengthening lyes_ are run to storage to be used subsequently with\r\nfresh fat to take up the caustic soda contained therein.\r\n\r\nThe soap is now ready for finishing and is first boiled through and\r\ntried for strength. A drop of phenolphthalein (1 per cent.\r\nphenolphthalein in 98 per cent. alcohol) is allowed to drop on the\r\nmolten soap taken up on a trowel. The red color should be instantly\r\nproduced and develop to a full deep crimson in a few seconds, or more\r\nlye must be added until this condition is realized. Should it flash a\r\ndeep crimson immediately it is on the strong side. This cannot be\r\nconveniently remedied; it can only serve as a guide for the next boil,\r\nbut in any case it is not of any serious consequence, unless it is too\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nWith the steam on, the soap is now examined with a trowel which must be\r\nthoroughly heated by working it about under the surface of the hot soap.\r\nThe appearance of the soap as it runs from the face of the trowel\r\nindicates its condition. It is not possible to absolutely describe the\r\neffect, which can only be properly judged by practice, yet the following\r\npoints may serve as a guide. The indications to be noticed are the shape\r\nand size of the flakes of soap as the sample on the trowel breaks up and\r\nruns from the hot iron surface, when the latter is turned in a vertical\r\nposition, as well as the condition of the iron surface from which the\r\nsoap flakes have fallen. A closed soap will run slowly into a\r\nhomogeneous sheet, leaving the trowel's surface covered with a thin\r\nlayer of transparent soap; a grained mass will run rapidly down in tiny\r\ngrains, about one-half an inch in diameter or less, leaving the hot\r\ntrowel absolutely dry. The object of the finish is to separate the\r\nsoaps of the lower fatty acids from those of the higher, and both from\r\nexcess of liquid. A point midway between \"open\" and \"closed\" is required\r\nto arrive at this point.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the above condition, the soap is allowed to settle\r\nanywhere from one to three days and then run off through the skimmer\r\npipes to the nigre and framed or pumped to the tank feeding the drying\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThe stock thus obtained should be fairly white, depending upon the grade\r\nof tallow used and slightly alkaline to an alcoholic phenolphthalein\r\nsolution. If removed at exactly the neutral point or with a content of\r\nfree fat the soap will sooner or later develop rancidity. The soap thus\r\nobtained is an ordinary tallow base, and the one by far greatest used in\r\nthe manufacture of toilet soaps. The percentage of cocoanut oil\r\nindicated is not fixed and may readily be varied, while in fine toilet\r\nsoap the rosin is usually eliminated.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of full boiled soda soaps in which no glycerine is\r\nobtained as a by-product, it being retained in the soap itself, the soap\r\nformed is known as a \"run\" soap. The process is used most extensively in\r\nthe manufacture of marine soaps by which the method may be best\r\nillustrated. This soap is known as marine soap because of its property\r\nof readily forming a lather with salt water and is mostly consumed\r\naboard vessels.\r\n\r\nMarine soaps are manufactured by first placing in the kettle a\r\ncalculated amount of lye of 25 deg. to 35 deg. B., depending upon the\r\namount of moisture desired in the finished soaps, plus a slight excess\r\nrequired to saponify a known weight of cocoanut oil. With open steam on,\r\nthe cocoanut oil is then gradually added, care being taken that the soap\r\ndoes not froth over. Saponification takes place readily and when the oil\r\nis entirely saponified the finished soap is put through the process\r\nknown as running. This consists in constantly pumping the mass from the\r\nskimmer pipe back into the top of the kettle, the object being to\r\nprevent any settling of the nigre or lye from the soap, as well as\r\nproducing a homogeneous mass. It is customary to begin the\r\nsaponification in the morning, which should be completed by noon. The\r\nsoap is then run for about three hours and framed the next morning.\r\nAfter having remained in the frame the time required to solidify and\r\ncool, the soap is slabbed and cut into cakes. This process is difficult\r\nto carry out properly, and one not greatly employed, although large\r\nquantities of marine soap are purchased by the government for use in the\r\nnavy and must fulfill certain specifications required by the purchasing\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nIn making potash soaps it is practically impossible to obtain any\r\nglycerine directly because of the pasty consistency of the soap, and no\r\ngraining is possible because the addition of salt to a soft soap, as\r\nalready explained, would form a soda soap. Large quantities of soft\r\nsoaps are required for the textile industries who desire mostly a strong\r\npotash soap, and the large number of automobiles in use at the present\r\ntime has opened a field for the use of a soft soap for washing these. A\r\nsoap for this purpose must be neutral so as not to affect the varnish or\r\npaint of automobiles.\r\n\r\nA suitable soap for textile purposes may be made as follows:\r\n\r\n    Red oil                         80     parts\r\n    House grease                    20     parts\r\n    Caustic soda lye, 36 degs. B.    3     parts\r\n    Carbonate of potash              5-1/2 parts\r\n    Caustic potash                  23-1/4 parts\r\n\r\nOlive oil, corn oil, soya bean oil, olive oil foots or cottonseed oil\r\nmay replace any of the above oils. A large quantity of cottonseed oil\r\nwill cause the soap to fig.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the process, the caustic potash and carbonate of potash are\r\ndissolved and placed in the kettle together with the soda lye, and the\r\noils added. This is most satisfactorily accomplished by being finished\r\nthe day before the boiling is begun. The next day the boiling is begun\r\nand water added to bring the soap up to the desired percentage of fatty\r\nacid, due allowance being made for the water formed by the condensation\r\nof the open steam in boiling. Care must be taken that the soap in the\r\nkettle does not swell and run over during the saponification. A good\r\nprocedure is to use open steam for a period of about two hours, then\r\nclose the valve and allow the saponification to continue without\r\nboiling, and repeat this until it is entirely saponified. After the\r\nsaponification has been completed the soap is briskly boiled all day and\r\nthe proper corrections made; that is, if too alkaline, more oil is\r\nadded, and if free fat is present, more potash. About 2 per cent.\r\ncarbonate of potash is the proper amount for a soap containing 50 per\r\ncent. fatty acid. The soap is sampled by allowing it to drop on a clean,\r\ncold glass surface. In so doing, the soap should not slide or slip over\r\nthe glass surface when pressed thereon, but should adhere to the glass,\r\nor it is too alkaline. A sample worked between the fingers showing too\r\nmuch stringiness should have more strong potash and oil added. A sample\r\ntaken out in a pail and allowed to cool over night will serve as a guide\r\nas to the body of the soap in the kettle. When the soap has thus been\r\nproperly finished it is run into barrels.\r\n\r\nFor an automobile soap the following is a good working formula:\r\n\r\n    Corn oil                       1,000 parts\r\n    Potash lye, 31-1/2 degs. B.      697 parts\r\n\r\nProceed as in the directions just given for textile soap in placing\r\ncharge in the kettle. When the kettle is boiling up well, shut off the\r\nsteam and the saponification will complete itself. The soap may be run\r\ninto the barrels the next day.\r\n\r\nA heavy soap with a smaller percentage of fat may be made as follows:\r\n\r\n    Corn oil                       1,000 parts\r\n    Potash lye, 24-1/2 degs. B.      900 parts\r\n\r\nBoil until the soap bunches, and shovel the finished soap into barrels.\r\nUpon standing it will clear up. By the addition of more water the yield\r\nof soap per pound of oil may be run up to 300 per cent.\r\n\r\nAfter soft soaps have been allowed to stand for some time the phenomenon\r\nknown as \"figging\" often occurs. This term is applied to a\r\ncrystalline-like formation, causing spots of a star-like shape\r\nthroughout the soap. This is undoubtedly due to the stearine content of\r\nthe soap crystallizing out as it cools, and forming these\r\npeculiarly-shaped spots. It more generally occurs in the winter and may\r\nbe produced artificially by adding a small quantity of soda to the\r\npotash lye before saponification.\r\n\r\nThe oils usually employed in the manufacture of potash soaps are\r\ncottonseed oil, corn oil, soya bean oil, olive oil foots, red oil,\r\ncocoanut oil, grease and the various train oils. The usual percentage\r\nyield is from 225 per cent. to 300 per cent., based upon the weight of\r\noil used. In calculating the weight of a soft soap it is to be\r\nremembered that since potassium has a higher molecular weight (56) than\r\nsodium (40), the corresponding soap formed is that much greater in\r\nweight when compared with a sodium soap. Rosin may be added to soft\r\nsoaps as a cheapening agent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD PROCESS.\r\n\r\nThe cold process for manufacturing soap is the simplest method of soap\r\nmaking, and the equipment required is small when compared to the other\r\nmethods. All the more expensive equipment that is necessary is a\r\ncrutcher, a tank to hold the lye, frames, a slabber or cutting table,\r\nand a press. Yet, in spite of the simplicity of thus making soap, the\r\ndisadvantages are numerous for the production of a good piece of soap.\r\nThe greatest difficulty is to obtain a thorough combination of oil or\r\nfat and lye so that there will not be an excess of one or the other in\r\nthe finished soap. At its best there is either a considerable excess of\r\nfree fat which later exhibits itself in producing rancidity or\r\nuncombined caustic, which produces an unpleasant effect on the skin when\r\nthe soap is consumed for washing. The latter objection, of course, can\r\nonly be applied to toilet soaps.\r\n\r\nCocoanut oil is used very largely in the manufacture of cold-made soaps\r\nas it is well adapted for this purpose, although it is by no means true\r\nthat other oils may not be employed. Since by this process of\r\nmanufacture no impurity contained in the fat or oil is removed in the\r\nmaking of the soap, it is necessary that in order to obtain a fine\r\nfinished product, any impurity contained in these may be removed if\r\npresent, or that the fats be as pure as can be obtained. If inedible\r\ntallow is used for cold-made soap, it is advisable to bleach it by the\r\nFuller's Earth Process.\r\n\r\nThe carrying out of this method is best illustrated by an example of a\r\ncold-made cocoanut oil soap.\r\n\r\n    Charge:\r\n\r\n    Cochin cocoanut oil          846 parts\r\n    Lye (soda), 35 degs. B.      470 parts\r\n    Water                         24 parts\r\n\r\nThe oil is run into the crutcher and the temperature of the oil raised\r\nto 100 degs. F. by dry steam. The lye and water are at room temperature.\r\nAfter all the oil is in the crutcher, the lye and water are slowly added\r\nto prevent any graining of the soap. Toward the end the lye may be added\r\nmore rapidly. When all the lye is in, the mass is crutched for about\r\nthree hours, or until upon stopping the crutcher a finger drawn over the\r\nsurface of the soap leaves an impression. If this condition is not\r\nrealized, the soap must be mixed until such is the case. Having arrived\r\nat this point, the mixture is dropped into a frame which should remain\r\nuncovered. The heat produced by the further spontaneous saponification\r\nwill cause the soap to rise in the middle of the frame. After having set\r\nfor some days it is ready to be slabbed and cut into cakes.\r\n\r\nA potash soap may be made by the cold process just as readily as a soda\r\nsoap. Soaps of this type may be made by either of these formulae in a\r\ncrutcher:\r\n\r\n    Olive oil foots                                  600\r\n    Potash lye, 18 degs. B. hot, 20 degs. B. cold    660\r\n\r\n                    or\r\n\r\n    Corn oil                                         800\r\n    Rosin                                            200\r\n    Potash lye, 27 degs. B.                          790\r\n    Water                                            340\r\n\r\nHeat the oils to 190 degs. F., add the lye and crutch until the soap\r\nbegins to bunch, when it is ready to be run into barrels where the\r\nsaponification will be completed.\r\n\r\nSemi-boiled soaps differ from those made by the cold process in\r\ntemperature. In making semi-boiled soaps the fats are usually heated to\r\n140deg. F. The addition of the lye raises the temperature to\r\n180deg.--200deg. F. when saponification takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONATE SAPONIFICATION.\r\n\r\nThe method of the formation of soap by the utilization of the fatty acid\r\ndirectly, from which the glycerine has already been removed by some\r\nmethod of saponification other than with caustic soda, and neutralizing\r\nthis with alkali, is becoming increasingly popular. The glycerine is\r\nmore easily recovered from a previous cleavage of the fats or oils, but\r\na soap made from the mixed fatty acids thus obtained is seldom white in\r\ncolor and retains an unpleasant odor. Since soda ash or sodium carbonate\r\nis cheaper than caustic soda and readily unites with a fatty acid, it is\r\nused as the alkali in the carbonate saponification. The process is\r\nsimilar to that already given under Rosin Saponification. About 19 per\r\ncent. by weight of the fatty acids employed of 58 per cent. soda ash is\r\ndissolved in water until it has a density of 30 degs. B., and the\r\nsolution is run into the kettle, which is usually equipped with a\r\nremovable agitator. The fatty acids, previously melted, are then slowly\r\nadded while the mixture is boiled with open steam and agitated with the\r\nstirring device. The fatty acids instantly unite with the carbonate and\r\nrise in the kettle, due to the generation of carbon dioxide, and care\r\nmust be exercised to prevent boiling over. After all the fatty acid has\r\nbeen added, and the mass is boiled through the saponification must be\r\ncompleted with caustic soda, as there is as yet no practical method\r\nknown which will split a fat entirely into fatty acid and glycerine.\r\nThus about 10 per cent. of the fatty acids are true neutral fats and\r\nrequire caustic soda for their saponification. This is then added and\r\nthe soap completed, as in full-boiled soaps.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out this method upon a large scale, large\r\nsue\\Neanderthal\\doroteer\\Neanderthal\\Josephine\\ quantities of carbon\r\ndioxide are formed during the boiling of the soap, which replaces a\r\nquantity of the air contained therein. The kettle room should therefore\r\nbe well ventilated, allowing for a large inflow of fresh air from out of\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nClassification of Soaps.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering the many different varieties of soaps, their\r\nclassification is purely an arbitrary one. No definite plan can be\r\noutlined for any particular brand to be manufactured nor can any very\r\nsharp distinction be drawn between the many soaps of different\r\nproperties which are designated by various names. It is really a\r\nquestion to what use a soap is to be put, and at what price it may be\r\nsold. There is, of course, a difference in the appearance, form and\r\ncolor, and then there are soaps of special kinds, such as floating\r\nsoaps, transparent soaps, liquid soaps, etc., yet in the ultimate sense\r\nthey are closely allied, because they are all the same chemical\r\ncompound, varying only in their being a potash or soda soap, and in the\r\nfatty acids which enter into combination with these alkalis. Thus we can\r\ntake a combination of tallow and cocoanut oil and make a great many\r\npresumably different soaps by combining these substances with caustic\r\nsoda, by different methods of manufacture and by incorporating various\r\nother ingredients, as air, to form a floating soap, alcohol to make a\r\ntransparent soap, dyestuffs to give a different color, etc., but\r\nessentially it is the same definite compound.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer can best judge the brand of soaps he desires to\r\nmanufacture, and much of his success depends upon the name, package,\r\nshape, color or perfume of a cake of soap. It is the consumer whom he\r\nmust please and many of the large selling brands upon the market today\r\nowe their success to the above mentioned details. The great majority of\r\nconsumers of soap know very little concerning soap, except the fact\r\nthat it washes or has a pleasant odor or looks pretty, and the\r\nmanufacturer of soap must study these phases of the subject even more\r\ncarefully than the making of the soap itself.\r\n\r\nFor a matter of convenience we will classify soap under three general\r\ndivisions:\r\n\r\nI. Laundry soaps, including chip soaps, soap powders and scouring soaps.\r\n\r\nII. Toilet soaps, including floating soap, castile soap, liquid soap,\r\nshaving soap, etc.\r\n\r\nIII. Textile soaps.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUNDRY SOAP.\r\n\r\nThe most popular household soap is laundry soap. A tremendous amount of\r\nthis soap is consumed each day in this country, and it is by far\r\nmanufactured in larger quantities than any other soap. It is also a soap\r\nwhich must be sold cheaper than any other soap that enters the home.\r\n\r\nThe consumers of laundry soap have been educated to use a full boiled\r\nsettled rosin soap and to make a good article at a price this method\r\nshould be carried out, as it is the one most advisable to use. The\r\ncomposition of the fats entering into the soap depends upon the market\r\nprice of these, and it is not advisable to keep to one formula in the\r\nmanufacture of laundry soap, but rather to adjust the various fatty\r\ningredients to obtain the desired results with the cheapest material\r\nthat can be purchased. It is impossible to use a good grade of fats and\r\nmake a profit upon laundry soap at the price at which it must be\r\nretailed. The manufacturer of this grade of soap must look to the\r\nby-product, glycerine, for his profit and he is fortunate indeed if he\r\nrealizes the entire benefit of this and still produces a superior piece\r\nof laundry soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMI-BOILED LAUNDRY SOAPS.\r\n\r\nIt is advantageous at times to make a laundry soap by a method other\r\nthan the full boiled settled soap procedure as previously outlined. This\r\nis especially the condition in making a naphtha soap, in which is\r\nincorporated naphtha, which is very volatile and some of the well known\r\nmanufacturers of this class of soap have adopted this process entirely.\r\nA laundry soap containing rosin cannot be advantageously made by the\r\ncold process, as the soap thus made grains during saponification and\r\ndrops a portion of the lye and filling materials. By making a\r\nsemi-boiled soap this objection is overcome. The half boiled process\r\ndiffers from the cold process by uniting the fats and alkalis at a\r\nhigher temperature.\r\n\r\nTo carry out this process the following formulae have been found by\r\nexperience to give satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n                     I.         lbs.\r\n\r\n    Tallow                       100\r\n    Rosin                         60\r\n    Soda Lye, 36deg. B.              80\r\n\r\n                    II.\r\n\r\n    Tallow                       100\r\n    Rosin                         60\r\n    Silicate of Soda              25\r\n    Soda Lye, 36deg. B.              85\r\n\r\n                    III.\r\n\r\n    Tallow                       100\r\n    Rosin                        100\r\n    Lye, 36deg. B.                  105\r\n    Silicate of Soda              25\r\n    Sal Soda Solution             20\r\n\r\nIn any of these formulas the sodium silicate (40deg. B.) may be increased\r\nto the same proportion as the fats used. By so doing, however, twenty\r\npounds of 36deg. B. lye must be added for every hundred pounds of silicate\r\nadditional to that indicated or in other words, for every pound of\r\nsilicate added 20 per cent. by weight of 36deg. B. lye must be put into the\r\nmixture. The rosin may also be replaced by a previously made rosin soap.\r\n\r\nTo make a semi-boiled soap, using any of the above formulae, first melt\r\nthe rosin with all or part of the fat, as rosin when melted alone\r\nreadily decomposes. When the mixture is at 150deg. F. run it into the\r\ncrutcher and add the lye. Turn on sufficient dry steam to keep the\r\ntemperature of the soap at about 150deg. F. in the winter or 130deg. F. in\r\nsummer. After the mass has been mixed for half an hour, by continuously\r\ncrutching the soap it will at first thicken, then grain and it may again\r\nbecome thick before it becomes smooth. When the mass is perfectly smooth\r\nand homogeneous drop into a frame and crutch in the frame by hand to\r\nprevent streaking. After standing the required length of time the soap\r\nis finished into cakes as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLED ROSIN SOAP.\r\n\r\nSettled rosin soaps are made from tallow, grease, cottonseed oil,\r\nbleached palm oils of the lower grades, corn oil, soya bean oil, arachis\r\noil, distilled garbage grease, cottonseed foots or fatty acids together\r\nwith an addition of rosin, varying from 24 per cent. to 60 per cent. of\r\nthe fatty acids which should titer from 28 to 35. A titer lower than 28\r\nwill prevent the finished kettle of soap from being capable of later\r\ntaking up the filling materials. As has already been stated under\r\nhardened oils, these being very much higher in titer allow a greater\r\npercentage of rosin to be added. Thus hardened fish oils and cottonseed\r\noil are gradually being more extensively employed in soaps of this\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe procedure of handling the kettle is similar to that given under full\r\nboiled soap. The stock is steamed out into a settling tank and allowed\r\nto settle over night, after which it is pumped into the soap kettle.\r\nHaving stocked the kettle, open steam is turned on and 10deg.-12deg. B.\r\nlye is run in, while using a steam pressure of ninety to one hundred\r\npounds in order to prevent too great a quantity of condensation of the\r\nsteam, the water thus being formed weakening the lye. If a steam\r\npressure of fifty to sixty pounds is available, a stronger lye (20deg.\r\nB.) should be added. Care must be taken not to allow the lye to flow in\r\ntoo rapidly or the soap will not grain. The saponification is only\r\nattained by prolonged boiling with sufficient lye of proper strength.\r\nWhen saponification has taken place, the mass begins to clear and a\r\nsample taken out with a paddle and cooled should show a slight pink with\r\na 1 per cent. alcoholic phenolphthalein solution.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated here that in using this indicator or any other to test\r\nthe alkalinity of soap, the soap should always be cooled and firm, as\r\nwhenever water is present, the dissociation of the soap thereby will\r\nalways react alkaline. When this state is reached the mass is ready for\r\ngraining, which is accomplished by distributing salt brine or pickle or\r\nspreading dry salt over the surface of the soap. The kettle is then\r\nthoroughly boiled until the mass shows a soft curd and the lye drops\r\nclearly from a sample taken out with a trowel or paddle. The steam is\r\nthen shut off and the soap allowed to settle over night. The lyes are\r\nthen run off to the spent lye tank for glycerine recovery. In\r\nsaponifying a freshly stocked kettle it is apt to bunch. To prevent this\r\nsalt is added at various times to approximately one per cent. of the fat\r\nused.\r\n\r\nIf, by any possibility the soap has bunched, this condition may be\r\nremedied by the addition of more strong lye and boiling until it is\r\ntaken up. To work a kettle to its full capacity it is advisable to make\r\ntwo \"killing\" changes. First add about 75 per cent. of the fat and grain\r\nas directed. Run off the spent lyes and then add the remainder of the\r\nstock and repeat the process. When the spent lye has been run to\r\nstorage, the open steam is again turned on and 18deg. B. lye gradually\r\nallowed to run in. The rosin is now broken up and put into the kettle,\r\nor a previously made rosin soap is pumped in.\r\n\r\nLye is then added until the soap has a sharp taste after about three\r\nhours of continuous boiling, or when the soap is in the closed state.\r\nMore lye should then be run into the kettle to grain the soap well, the\r\ngrain not being too small. Then allow the soap to settle over night and\r\ndraw off the strengthening lye. The next day again boil up the kettle\r\nand add water until the soap thins out and rises or swells high in the\r\nkettle. A sample taken out at this stage upon a hot trowel should run\r\noff in large flakes. The surface of the soap should be bright and shiny.\r\n\r\nIf the sample clings to the trowel, a slight addition of lye will remedy\r\nthis defect. The kettle is then allowed to rest, to drop the nigre and\r\nto cool for some time, depending upon the size of the kettle. The proper\r\ntemperature is such that after having been pumped to the crutcher and\r\nthe filling materials having been added, a thermometer placed into the\r\nmass should indicate 128deg.-135deg. F. after the crutcher has run from\r\nten to fifteen minutes. The filling material may consist of from 7-9 per\r\ncent. of sal soda solution, 36deg.-37deg. B. warm or just enough to\r\nclose up the soap and make it rise high in the center of a screw\r\ncrutcher and make it cling close to a warm trowel. Other fillers such as\r\noutlined below are added at this point.\r\n\r\nAn addition of from 2-3 per cent. of a special mineral oil for this\r\npurpose will impart a finish to the soap and 3-5 per cent. starch added\r\nprevents the soap from cracking in the frames. Other filling material as\r\nsilicate of soda, borax, talc or silex are used. After the filling\r\nmaterial has been thoroughly crutched through the soap it is framed,\r\nand, after being several days in the frame to solidify and cool the soap\r\nis ready for slabbing, pressing and wrapping.\r\n\r\nIn order to more definitely illustrate the composition of the mixture of\r\nfats and oils entering into the formation of a laundry soap a typical\r\nformula may be given for such a soap containing 40 per cent. rosin added\r\nto the amount of fats used:\r\n\r\n                                  lbs.\r\n    Grease                      7,000\r\n    Tallow                      4,000\r\n    Corn Oil                    7,000\r\n    Cottonseed Oil              3,000\r\n    Rosin                       8,400\r\n\r\nThe following have been found to be satisfactory filling materials and\r\nare calculated upon the basis of a 1,400-pound frame of soap.\r\n\r\n                          I.             lbs.\r\n\r\n    Sodium Silicate, 38deg.-40deg.

It may be made either as a settled soap or by the cold\r\nmade process.\r\n\r\nTo make a full boiled settled chip soap, proceed as directed under\r\nsettled laundry soap. The kettle is stocked with light grease or a\r\nmixture of grease with corn oil or other cheap oils.

The tallow is heated to 120deg. to\r\n135deg. F. and the lye run in slowly at first and then the silicate of soda\r\nis added. The mass is then mixed until a finger drawn through the soap\r\nleaves a slight impression, then dropped into frames or barrels. Soaps\r\ncontaining a small percentage of fat should be well covered in the frame\r\nfor twenty-four hours to retain their heat and insure proper\r\nsaponification.

A number\r\nof the best soaps of this kind are made from a settled soap using a\r\nlight grease with corn oil. A soap of this nature is made as follows.\r\n\r\n                                          lbs.\r\n    Settled Soap                           800\r\n    Sal Soda Solution, 36deg.-37deg.

They may be manufactured so cheaply and still be\r\nefficient, that their use has almost become universal for cleansing and\r\nscouring purposes. The uses to which soap and scouring powders are\r\nadapted are too well known to enter into a description of their\r\nemployment. Since they offer a greater profit to the manufacturer than\r\nordinary household soap, many brands are extensively advertised.\r\n\r\nNumerous combinations for soap powders might be cited and it is a simple\r\nmatter to vary the ingredients as to fat content and manufacture a\r\npowder of this sort as low as a cent a pound. Many substances are\r\nincorporated with soap, such as salt, soda ash, tripoli, crushed\r\nvolcanic deposits, ground feldspar, infusorial earth of various kinds,\r\nsilex, etc. In addition to these various fillers, compounds with true\r\ncleansing and bleaching properties, in addition to soap, are added, such\r\nas the salts of ammonium (sal ammoniac, carbonate of ammonia), sodium\r\nperborate and the peroxides of various metals. The public, however, have\r\nbeen accustomed to receive a large package of soap or scouring powder\r\nfor a small amount of money and it is a difficult matter for the\r\nmanufacturer to add more expensive substances of this nature to his\r\nproduct, to increase its efficiency, without raising the price or\r\ndecreasing the size of the package.\r\n\r\nIn manufacturing soap powders, the dried soap chips might be mixed with\r\nthe filler and alkali and then pulverized. This method is not\r\nextensively employed nevertheless. The process which is the most\r\neconomical is one whereby the ingredients are mixed in a specially\r\nadapted mixer for heavy material until dry and then run directly to the\r\ncrusher and pulverizer, after which it is automatically packed, sealed\r\nand boxed. Another method of procedure is to run out the mixture from\r\nthe crutcher to the frames, which are stripped before the soap cools,\r\nand is cut up at once, for if it hardens it could not be cut with wires.\r\nIt is better, however, to run the mixture into sheets upon a specially\r\nconstructed floor and break up the mass when cool.\r\n\r\nFormulae for soap powders which have been found to be suitable for\r\nrunning dry in the mixer follow:\r\n\r\n                        I\r\n    Soda ash, 58 per cent.                   42 lbs.\r\n    Silica                                  220  \"\r\n    Settled soap (usually cottonseed).       25  \"\r\n    Salt                                     10  \"\r\n\r\n                       II\r\n    Soap (settled cottonseed)                40 lbs.\r\n    Soda ash, 58 per cent.                   60  \"\r\n\r\n                      III\r\n    Settled soap                            100 lbs.\r\n    Soda ash, 58 per cent.                  400  \"\r\n\r\nFillers in varying proportions may replace the soda ash in the above\r\nformulae. It is of course understood that the soap has been previously\r\nmade and run as molten soap into the crutcher.\r\n\r\nThe following soap powders will not dry up in the crutcher upon running,\r\nbut are of the class which may be framed or run on the floor to\r\nsolidify:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         I\r\n    Soap                                 850 lbs.\r\n    Filler                               400  \"\r\n    Sal soda solution, 20 degs.

The manufacturer must judge for himself just what\r\nfilling material to use. The filler indicated in the above formulae is\r\ntherefore left open. A few formulae for more expensive powders than\r\nthose given recently appeared among others in the \"Seifensieder\r\nZeitung\"[9]:\r\n\r\n\r\n                     I\r\n\r\n    Powdered soap                         90 lbs.\r\n    Sodium perborate                      10  \"\r\n\r\nThe perborate should be added when the powder is perfectly dry or it\r\nloses its bleaching properties.\r\n\r\n                     II\r\n\r\n    Soap powder, 20 per cent. fat.\r\n    Cocoanut oil fatty acids              25 lbs.\r\n    Olein                                 25  \"\r\n    Bone fat                              70  \"\r\n    Soda lye, 30 degs.

The first method requiring a minimum equipment is to mix the\r\npowder and sal soda in a mixer, allow it to stand in frames for a week\r\nto crystallize or spread it on the floor for a few hours to dry and then\r\ngrinding it.\r\n\r\nThe continuous method finishes the powder in a few minutes and with a\r\nminimum amount of labor. By this process the various ingredients, soap,\r\nsoda ash solution, etc., are measured, run by gravity into the mixer,\r\nmixed and the molten mass run over the crystallizer or chilling rolls\r\nthru which either cold water or brine is pumped. From the roll the\r\npowder is scraped off clean by a knife, passes to a screen which sends\r\nthe tailings to a grinder, falls into a storage bin from whence it is\r\nweighed and packed by an automatic weighing machine into cartons made up\r\nin most cases by another machine. Due to the large percentage of\r\nmoisture contained in these soap powders the carton is generally wrapped\r\nin wax paper to aid in the prevention of the escape of moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOURING POWDERS.\r\n\r\nScouring powders are very similar to soap powders and differ only in the\r\nfiller used. We have already considered these fillers under scouring\r\nsoap, from which they do not differ materially. They are usually\r\ninsoluble in water to aid in scouring. The mixer used for substances of\r\nthis kind in incorporating the soap and alkali must be of strong\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOURING SOAP.\r\n\r\nScouring soaps resemble soap powders very closely in their composition,\r\nin that they are a combination of soap and filling material. Since more\r\nlather is required from a scouring soap than in soap powders, a cocoanut\r\noil soap is generally used. The usual filling material used is silex.\r\nThe greatest difficulty in the manufacture of scouring soap is the\r\ncracking of the finished cake. This is usually due to the incorporation\r\nof too great an amount of filler, or too high a percentage of moisture.\r\n\r\nIn manufacturing these soaps the cocoanut oil is saponified in the\r\ncrutcher with 38 degs. B. lye, or previously saponified as a run soap,\r\nas already described under \"Marine Soaps.\" To twenty-five parts of soap\r\nare added a percentage of 38 degs. B. sal soda or soda ash solution,\r\ntogether with a small quantity of salt brine. To this mixture in the\r\ncrutcher seventy-five parts of silex are then added, and a sufficient\r\namount of hot water to make the mass flow readily. Care must be\r\nexercised to not add too great a quantity of water or the mass will\r\ncrack when it cools. The mass is then framed and cut before it sets, or\r\npoured into molds and allowed to set. While silex is the most\r\nextensively used filler for scouring soaps, it is feasible to\r\nincorporate other substances of like character, although it is to be\r\nremembered that the consumer is accustomed to a white cake, such as\r\nsilex produces. Any other material used to replace silex should also be\r\nas fine as this product.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOATING SOAP.\r\n\r\nFloating soap occupies a position midway between laundry and toilet\r\nsoap. Since it is not highly perfumed and a large piece of soap may be\r\npurchased for small cost, as is the case with laundry soap, it is\r\nreadily adaptable to general household use. Floating soap differs from\r\nordinary soap in having air crutched into it which causes the soap to\r\nfloat in water. This is often advantageous, especially as a bath soap,\r\nand undoubtedly the largest selling brand of soap on the American market\r\ntoday is a floating soap.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of floating soap a high proportion of cocoanut oil is\r\nnecessary. A most suitable composition is one part cocoanut oil to one\r\npart of tallow. This is an expensive stock for the highest grade of soap\r\nand is usually cheapened by the use of cottonseed or various other\r\nliquid oils. Thus it is possible to obtain a floating soap from a kettle\r\nstocked with 30 per cent. cocoanut oil, 15 per cent. cottonseed oil and\r\n55 per cent. tallow. With this quality of soap, however, there is a\r\npossibility of sweating and rancidity, and of the soap being too soft\r\nand being poor in color.\r\n\r\nThe process of manufacture is to boil the soap in an ordinary soap\r\nkettle, after which air is worked into the hot soap by a specially\r\nconstructed crutcher, after which the soap is framed, slabbed, cut into\r\ncakes and pressed.\r\n\r\nConcerning the boiling of the soap, the saponification must be carefully\r\ncarried out, as the high proportion of cocoanut oil may cause a violent\r\nreaction in the kettle causing it to boil over.\r\n\r\nThe method of procedure is the same as for a settled soap up to the\r\nfinishing. When the mass is finally settled after the finish, the soap\r\nshould be more on the \"open\" side, and the object should be to get as\r\nlong a piece of goods as possible.\r\n\r\nDue to its high melting point, a much harder crust forms on the surface\r\nof a floating soap and in a greater proportion than on a settled soap\r\nduring the settling. In a large kettle, in fact, it has been found\r\nimpossible to break through this crust by the ordinary procedure to\r\nadmit the skimmer pipe. Much of the success of the subsequent operations\r\ndepends upon the completeness of the settling, and in order to overcome\r\nthe difficulties occasioned by the formation of the crust everything\r\npossible should be done in the way of covering the kettle completely to\r\nenable this period of settling to continue as long as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen the soap is finished it is run into a specially constructed U-shape\r\ncrutcher, a Strunz crutcher is best adapted to this purpose, although a\r\nrapidly revolving upright screw crutcher has been found to give\r\nsatisfaction upon a smaller scale, and a sufficient quantity of air\r\nbeaten into the soap to make it light enough to float. Care must be\r\ntaken not to run the crutcher too rapidly or the soap will be entirely\r\ntoo fobby. During this operation the mass of soap increases in bulk,\r\nand after it has been established how much air must be put into the soap\r\nto satisfy the requirements, this increase in bulk is a criterion to\r\nestimate when this process is completed.\r\n\r\nIt is of course understood that the longer the crutching continues the\r\ngreater quantity of air is incorporated and the increase of volume must\r\nbe established for a particular composition by sampling, cooling the\r\nsample rapidly and seeing if it floats in water. If the beating is\r\ncontinued too long an interval of time, the finished soap is too spongy\r\nand useless.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the mass during crutching is most important. This\r\nmust never exceed 158 degrees F. At 159 degrees F. the operation is not\r\nvery successful, yet the thermometer may indicate 140 degrees F. without\r\ninterfering with this operation. If, however, the temperature drops too\r\nlow, trouble is liable to be met with, by the soap solidifying too\r\nquickly in the frames.\r\n\r\nWhen the crutching is completed, the soap is allowed to drop into frames\r\nthrough the valve at the bottom of the crutcher and rapidly crutched by\r\nthe hand in the frames to prevent large air spaces and then allowed to\r\ncool. It is an improvement to jolt the frames as they are drawn away as\r\nthis tends to make the larger air bubbles float to the surface and thus\r\nreduce the quantity of waste. When the soap has cooled, the frame is\r\nstripped and the soap slabbed as usual. At this point a layer of\r\nconsiderable depth of spongy soap will be found to have formed. This of\r\ncourse must be cut away and returned to the kettle. The last few slabs\r\nare also often rejected, inasmuch as the weight of the soap above them\r\nhas forced out so much of the air that the soap no longer floats. As a\r\nfair average it may be estimated that not more than 50 to 60 per cent.\r\nof the soap in the kettle will come out as finished cakes. the\r\nremaining 40 to 50 per cent. being constituted by the heavy crust in the\r\nkettle, the spongy tops, the bottom slabs and scrapings. This soap is of\r\ncourse reboiled and consequently not lost, but the actual cakes obtained\r\nare produced at a cost of practically double labor.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to add a small quantity of soap blue color to the mass\r\nwhile crutching to neutralize the yellowish tint a floating soap is\r\nliable to have.\r\n\r\nSome manufacturers add a percentage of carbonate of soda, about 3 per\r\ncent., to prevent the soap from shrinking. Floating soap may also be\r\nloaded with sodium silicate to the extent of about 5 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOILET SOAP.\r\n\r\nIt is not a simple matter to differentiate between toilet soaps and\r\nvarious other soaps, because numerous soaps are adaptable to toilet\r\npurposes. While some soaps of this variety are manufactured by the cold\r\nmade or semi-boiled process, and not milled, the consumer has become\r\naccustomed to a milled soap for general toilet use.\r\n\r\nThe toilet base most extensively employed is a tallow and cocoanut base\r\nmade as a full boiled settled soap. The manufacture of this base has\r\nalready been outlined and really needs no further comment except that it\r\nis to be remembered that a suitable toilet soap should contain no great\r\nexcess of free alkali which is injurious to the skin. Cochin cocoanut\r\noil is preferable to the Ceylon cocoanut oil or palm kernel oil, to use\r\nin conjunction with the tallow, which should be a good grade and color\r\nif a white piece of goods is desired. The percentage of cocoanut oil may\r\nbe anywhere from 10 to 25 per cent., depending upon the kind of lather\r\nrequired, it being remembered that cocoanut oil increases the lathering\r\npower of the soap.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a tallow base, numerous other oils are used in the\r\nmanufacture of toilet soaps, especially palm oil, palm kernel oil, olive\r\noil and olive oil foots, and to a much less extent arachis or peanut\r\noil, sesame oil and poppy seed oil, oils of the class of cottonseed,\r\ncorn and soya bean oils are not adapted to manufacturing a milled soap,\r\nas they form yellow spots in a finished cake of soap which has been kept\r\na short time.\r\n\r\nPalm oil, especially the Lagos oil, is much used in making a palm base.\r\nAs has already been stated, the oil is bleached before saponification. A\r\npalm base has a yellowish color, a sweetish odor, and a small quantity\r\nadded to a tallow base naturally aids the perfume. It is especially good\r\nfor a violet soap. The peculiarity of a palm oil base is that this oil\r\nmakes a short soap. By the addition of some tallow or twenty to\r\ntwenty-five per cent. of cocoanut oil, or both, this objection is\r\novercome. It is a good plan in using a straight palm base to add a\r\nproportion of yellow color to hold the yellowish tint of this soap, as a\r\nsoap made from this oil continues bleaching upon exposure to air and\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nOlive oil and olive oil foots are used most extensively in the\r\nmanufacture of castile soaps. The peculiarity of an olive oil soap is\r\nthat it makes a very slimy lather, and like palm oil gives the soap a\r\ncharacteristic odor. An olive oil soap is usually considered to be a\r\nvery neutral soap and may readily be superfatted. Much olive oil soap is\r\nused in bars or slabs as an unmilled soap and it is often made by the\r\ncold process. Peanut oil or sesame and poppy seed oil often replaces\r\nolive oil, as they form a similar soap to olive oil.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of a toilet soap it is hardly practical to lay down a\r\ndefinite plan for the various bases to be made. From the combination of\r\ntallow, palm oil, cocoanut oil, palm kernel oil, olive oil and olive oil\r\nfoots, a great many bases of different proportions might be given. The\r\nsimplest method is to make a tallow base, a palm base and an olive oil\r\nbase. Then from these it is an easy matter to weigh out any proportion\r\nof these soap bases and obtain the proper mixture in the mill. If,\r\nhowever, as is often the case, a large quantity of soap base of certain\r\nproportions of these, four or even more of these fats and oils is\r\nrequired, it is not only more economical to stock the kettle with the\r\ncorrect proportion of these oils, but a more thorough mixture is thus\r\nobtained by saponifying these in the kettle. In view of the fact that it\r\nis really a question for the manufacturer to decide for himself what\r\ncombination of oils he desires for a particular soap we will simply\r\noutline a few typical toilet soap bases in their simplest combination.\r\nIt is understood that these soaps are suitable for milled soaps and are\r\nto be made as fully boiled settled soaps. Palm kernel oil may be\r\nsubstituted for cocoanut oil in all cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nTALLOW BASE.\r\n\r\n    Tallow                       75-90 parts\r\n    Cocoanut oil                 25-10 parts\r\n\r\n\r\nPALM BASE.\r\n\r\n    Bleached Lagos palm oil      75-80 parts\r\n    Cocoanut oil                 25-20 parts\r\n\r\n                or\r\n\r\n    Tallow                          30 parts\r\n    Palm oil                        60 parts\r\n    Cocoanut oil                    10 parts\r\n\r\n\r\nOLIVE OIL BASE (WHITE).\r\n\r\n    Olive oil                    75-90 parts\r\n    Cocoanut oil                 25-10 parts\r\n\r\n                  or\r\n\r\n    Olive oil                    40 parts\r\n    Tallow                       40 parts\r\n    Cocoanut                     20 parts\r\n\r\nWhere a green olive oil base is desired, olive oil foots are substituted\r\nfor the olive oil. Peanut oil may replace the olive oil or part of it,\r\nthe same being true of sesame oil and poppy seed oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALM AND OLIVE BASE.\r\n\r\n    Palm oil                     50 parts\r\n    Olive oil                    30 parts\r\n    Cocoanut oil                 20 parts\r\n\r\n                  or\r\n\r\n    Palm oil                     20 parts\r\n    Olive oil                    10 parts\r\n    Tallow                       50 parts\r\n    Cocoanut oil                 20 parts\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEAPER TOILET SOAPS.\r\n\r\nIt is often necessary to manufacture a cheaper grade of soap for toilet\r\npurposes to meet the demand of a certain class of trade as well as for\r\nexport. To accomplish this it is of course necessary to produce a very\r\ninferior product and run down the percentage of fatty acids contained in\r\nthe soaps by the addition of fillers or to use cheaper oils in\r\nmanufacturing. The most simple method of filling a soap is to load it at\r\nthe mill with some substance much less expensive than the soap itself.\r\nMany of the cheaper toilet soaps, however, are not milled and it is,\r\ntherefore, necessary to follow out some other procedure.\r\n\r\nMilled soaps, as has just been stated, are loaded at the mill. The\r\nconsumers of cheaper toilet soaps in this country are accustomed to a\r\nmilled soap and this grade of soap for home consumption is very often\r\nfilled with numerous substances, but most generally by adding starch\r\nand talc. The addition of such materials of course later exhibit\r\nthemselves by imparting to the cake of soap a dead appearance. Talc is\r\nmore readily detected in the soap than starch by washing with it, as\r\ntalc is insoluble and imparts a roughness to the soap, like sand or\r\npumice, as the soap wears down. It may readily be added to 20 per cent.\r\nby weight. Starch is to be preferred to talc, in loading a soap, as it\r\nis not so readily noticeable in washing. It leaves the cake itself\r\nabsolutely smooth although the lather formed is more shiny. This\r\nsubstance may be employed to as high a percentage as one-third the\r\nweight of the soap. It is, of course, possible to cheapen the best soap\r\nbase by this method and the price may be further lowered by using the\r\nless expensive oils and fats to make the soap base.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUN AND GLUED UP SOAPS.\r\n\r\nA very cheap grade of soap may be made by making a run soap and adding\r\nthe filler e. g. sodium silicate in the kettle during saponification.\r\nThe percentage of fatty acids may be brought down to 10 per cent.,\r\nalthough of course a soap of this type shrinks a whole lot upon\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nIn making a \"glued up\" soap the procedure is the same for making the\r\nsoap itself as with a settled soap, except that the soap is finished\r\n\"curd\" and later filled in the crutcher. The percentage of fatty acids\r\nin a soap of this type is seldom below 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe method of \"gluing up\" a soap is best illustrated by a typical soap\r\nof this character in which the kettle is charged with the following\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n    Bleached palm oil                          5 parts\r\n    Distilled grease                           2   \"\r\n    Cotton oil foots stock, 63% fatty acid     1   \"\r\n    Rosin                                      4   \"\r\n\r\nThe palm oil is first run into the kettle, saponified and washed to\r\nextract any glycerine, then the rest of the fats and finally the rosin.\r\nThe soap is then finished and settled as with a boiled settled soap. To\r\nassure success it is absolutely necessary that the soap settle as long a\r\nperiod as possible, or until the temperature is about 150 degs. F. The\r\nideal temperature for carrying out the \"gluing up\" process is 140 degs.\r\nF., as at a lower temperature than this the soap is liable to cool too\r\nquickly and not be thoroughly glued up. A higher temperature than 150\r\ndegs. F. causes delay in that the soap does not properly take the filler\r\nat a higher temperature and the soap must be kept in the crutcher until\r\nthe temperature drops to the right point.\r\n\r\nThe soap is run into the crutcher and the percentage of fatty acids run\r\ndown to 50-55 per cent. with one of the following mixtures:\r\n\r\n    Sodium silicate, 59-1/2deg. B.     1 part\r\n    Potassium carbonate, 51deg. B.     1  \"\r\n\r\n                    or\r\n\r\n    Sodium silicate, 59-1/2deg. B.     1 part\r\n    Potassium carbonate, 51deg. B.     1  \"\r\n    Sodium sulfate, 28deg. B.          1  \"\r\n\r\nFrom 230 to 300 pounds of either of these mixtures are required for a\r\ncrutcher holding 2,600 pounds of soap.\r\n\r\nThe crutching is continued until the mass is well \"spiked,\" that is to\r\nsay, a freshly broken surface of the soap, as the crutcher blade is\r\njerked away, stands up like shattered sheets in triangular form\r\n[Transcriber's note: three triangles]), which retain their shape\r\nperfectly. When this condition is realized the soap is run into frames\r\nwhich are carefully crutched by hand to remove any air spaces. The\r\nsurface of the soap is then smoothed down and heaped up in the center.\r\nAfter standing a day to contract, the surface is again leveled and a\r\nsnugly-fitting board placed on the top of the soap upon which a weight\r\nis placed or upon which the workman treads and stamps until the surface\r\nis flat, thus assuring the further removal of air spaces. The soap\r\nremains in the frame from six to eight days and is then slabbed, barred\r\nand pressed by the usual method employed for soaps thus handled without\r\nmilling.\r\n\r\nIn a soap of this nature no hard and fast rule can be laid down as to\r\nthe quantity of solution to be used for \"gluing up\" or the strength of\r\nthe solution. In a soap of the type described the most satisfactory\r\nappearing cake will be obtained from a soap containing 58 per cent.\r\nfatty acids. That is to say, about 8 per cent. to 10 per cent. filling\r\nsolution is added per hundred pounds of soap. The filling solutions\r\ngiven are very satisfactory. Carbonate of soda should be avoided in\r\nconnection with sodium silicate as the property of efflorescing on the\r\nsurface of the finished cake after a short time will prove detrimental.\r\nTo assure successful gluing up it is advisable to experiment upon a\r\nsmall scale to determine the exact extent to which the filling solution\r\nshould be diluted. Various proportions of water are added to a certain\r\nquantity of the filled soap. After the soap has been filled in a small\r\nreceptacle a sample is taken and rubbed between the fingers. If the\r\nfreshly exposed surface is smooth and glossy, the filling solution is\r\nweak enough, if rough it is too strong. It is of course understood that\r\nthe temperature must be correct, 140 degs. to 150 degs. F., or the soap\r\nwill be rough. By this means the operator can readily judge the correct\r\nstrength of his filling solution. When properly carried out a perfectly\r\nsatisfactory soap is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURD SOAP.\r\n\r\nThe object of a soap which is finished \"curd\" or grained, is to obtain a\r\nharder piece of goods from low titer fat or to increase the percentage\r\nof fatty acids in the finished soap. This is still another method of\r\nproducing a cheap grade of soap as by its adoption the cheaper oils and\r\nfats may be used to obtain a firm piece of soap.\r\n\r\nA typical charge for curd soap is:\r\n\r\n    Red oil        63 parts\r\n    Tallow         10  \"\r\n    Rosin          27  \"\r\n\r\nCotton seed foots may be employed in place of red oil and a tallow of\r\ntoo high titer is not suitable for this kind of soap.\r\n\r\nThe red oil and tallow are first saponified with 15 degs. B. lye, boiler\r\npressure 80-90 pounds, 18 degs. B. lye for lower steam pressure, and two\r\nwashings given to extract the glycerine. The rosin is added at the\r\nstrengthening change and at the finish the soap is \"pitched,\" that is to\r\nsay, the soap is settled over night only. The next day the lyes are\r\ndrawn off and a portion of the nigre pumped to another kettle which\r\nprevents later streaking of the soap. The soap is then boiled with 18\r\ndegs. B. lye as with another strengthening change under closed steam.\r\nSalt brine or \"pickle,\" 15 degs. B. is then added and the mass boiled\r\nwith closed steam until the brine reaches a density of 18 degs. B. and\r\nthe kettle pumped the next day. A soap of this type requires either hand\r\nor power crutching to assure homogeneity and prevention of streaks. To\r\nobviate any air spaces it is advisable to place over the top of the\r\nframe a tightly-fitted board which is heavily weighted down. This soap\r\nis also pressed without any milling.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD MADE TOILET SOAPS.\r\n\r\nComparatively little toilet soap is made by the cold or semi-boiled\r\nprocesses. While these are the simplest methods of manufacturing soaps\r\nthe drawbacks of using them are numerous and only in a few cases are\r\nthey very extensively employed. To make a toilet soap by the cold\r\nprocess a combination of good grade tallow and cocoanut oil is required.\r\nIt requires 50 per cent. by weight of 36 degs. B. lye to saponify a\r\ngiven weight of tallow and 50 per cent. of 38 degs. B. lye for cocoanut\r\noil. The lyes are used full strength or may be reduced slightly with\r\nwater and the method of procedure is the same as already given in the\r\ngeneral directions for cold made soaps.\r\n\r\nCold made soaps are readily filled with sodium silicate which is added\r\nat the same time the stock is put into the crutcher. In adding the\r\nsilicate it is necessary to add additional lye to that required for\r\nsaponifying the fats, about 20 per cent. of 36 degs. B. lye is the\r\nproper amount. There is of course a certain amount of shrinking due to\r\nthe addition of this filler and the finished cake is exceedingly hard,\r\nyet the author has seen a good looking cake of cheap soap made from as\r\nhigh a proportion as 420 parts of tallow to 600 parts of silicate.\r\n\r\nCold made soaps are usually pressed without milling, although it is\r\nreadily feasible to mill a cold made soap provided it is not a filled\r\nsoap such as has just been described.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERFUMING AND COLORING TOILET SOAPS.\r\n\r\nEqually important as the soap itself or even to a greater extent is the\r\nperfume of a toilet soap. A prominent manufacturer recently made the\r\nstatement, which is often the truth, that it makes no difference to the\r\npublic what kind of soap you give them, as long as you put plenty of\r\nodor into it. The perfuming of soaps is an art in itself and a subject\r\nto be treated by one versed in this particular branch. We can only take\r\ninto account the importance of the perfume as related to toilet soap\r\nnot only, but the necessity of adding a certain proportion of the\r\ncheaper products of odoriferous nature to laundry soap to cover and\r\ndisguise the odor of even this type of soap.\r\n\r\nThe price of a cake of toilet soap to a great extent depends upon the\r\nperfume, and the manufacturer should aim to give the best possible\r\nperfume for a certain price. He should not allow his personal likes or\r\ndislikes to enter into the judgment of whether an odor is good or not,\r\nbut submit it to a number of persons to obtain the concensus of opinion.\r\nIn giving or selling a piece of soap to the consumer, it is second\r\nnature for him to smell it, and in the great majority of cases his\r\nopinion is formed not from any quality the soap itself may have during\r\nuse, but from the odor. This only emphasizes the fact that the perfume\r\nmust be pleasing, not to one person, but to the majority, and many\r\nbrands owe their popularity to nothing more than the enticing perfume.\r\n\r\nPerfuming of soap is closely allied to the soap making industry, but as\r\nstated a branch in itself. It is, therefore, not our purpose to give\r\nnumerous formulae of how to perfume a soap, but rather to advise to go\r\nfor information to some one who thoroughly understands the\r\ncharacteristics of the numerous essential oils and synthetics and give\r\npositive information for the particular odor desired. Under no\r\ncircumstances is it advisable to purchase a perfume already compounded,\r\nbut since all perfumes are a blend of several or many essential oils and\r\nsynthetics, it is a more positive assurance of obtaining what is\r\ndesired, by purchasing the straight oils and blending or mixing them as\r\none desires.\r\n\r\nThe perfume is added to a milled soap just before the milling process in\r\nthe proper proportion per hundred pounds of soap. In cold made or\r\nunmilled soaps it is added in the crutcher while the soap is still hot.\r\nBy this method, of course, a proportion of the perfume is lost due to\r\nits being more or less volatile.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORING SOAP.\r\n\r\nWhile much toilet soap is white or natural in color, many soaps are also\r\nartificially colored. The soap colors used for this purpose are mostly\r\naniline dyestuffs. The price of these dyestuffs is no criterion as to\r\ntheir quality, as the price is usually regulated by the addition of some\r\ninert, water soluble substance like common salt or sugar.\r\n\r\nThe main properties that a dyestuff suitable for producing a colored\r\nsoap should have are fastness to light and to alkali. They should\r\nfurther be of such a type that the color does not come off and stain a\r\nwash cloth or the hands when the soap is used and should be soluble in\r\nwater. Under no circumstances is it advisable to add these in such a\r\nquantity that the lather produced in the soap is colored. It is\r\ncustomary to first dissolve the dye in hot water as a standardized\r\nsolution. This can then be measured out in a graduate and added to the\r\nsoap the same time as the perfume is put in. About one part of color to\r\nfifty parts of water is the proper proportion to obtain a perfect\r\nsolution, though this is by no means fixed. In making up a solution thus\r\nit is an improvement to add to the same about one-half of one per cent.\r\nof an alkali either as the hydroxide or carbonate. Then, if there is any\r\npossibility of change of color due to alkalinity of the soap, it will\r\nexhibit itself before the color is added.\r\n\r\nA particularly difficult shade to obtain is a purple, as there is up to\r\nthe present time no purplish aniline color known which is fast to light.\r\nVery good results in soap may be obtained by mixing a fast blue, as\r\nultramarine or cobalt blue, with a red as rhodamine or eosine.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the colors for soap have been carefully tested by most of\r\nthe dyestuff manufacturers, and their information, usually reliable, is\r\nopen to any one desiring to know about a color for soap, it is better to\r\ndepend upon their experience with colors after having satisfied one's\r\nself that a color is what it is represented for a particular shade, than\r\nto experiment with the numerous colors one's self.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINAL SOAPS.\r\n\r\nSoap is often used for the conveyance of various medicants, antiseptics\r\nor other material presumably beneficial for treatment of skin diseases.\r\nWhile soap is an ideal medium for the carrying of such materials, it is\r\nan unfortunate condition that when incorporated with the soap, all but a\r\nvery few of the numerous substances thus employed lose their medicinal\r\nproperties and effectiveness for curing skin disorders, as well as any\r\nantiseptic value the substance may have. Soap is of such a nature\r\nchemically that many of the substances used for skin troubles are either\r\nentirely decomposed or altered to such an extent so as to impair their\r\ntherapeutic value. Thus many of the claims made for various medicated\r\nsoaps fall flat, and really have no more antiseptic or therapeutic merit\r\nthan ordinary soap which in itself has certain germicidal and cleaning\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIn medicating a soap the material used for this purpose is usually added\r\nat the mill. A tallow and cocoanut oil base is best adapted for a soap\r\nof this type. The public have been educated more or less to the use of\r\ncolored soap to accentuate its medicinal value, and green is undoubtedly\r\nthe most popular shade. This inference, however, is by no means true for\r\nall soaps of this character. Possibly the best method of arranging\r\nthese soaps is briefly to outline some medicinal soaps.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULPHUR SOAPS.\r\n\r\nThe best known sulphur soaps contain anywhere from one to 20 per cent.\r\nof flowers of sulphur. Other soaps contain either organic or inorganic\r\nsulphur compounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAR SOAP.\r\n\r\nThe tar used in the manufacturing of tar soap is obtained by the\r\ndestructive distillation of wood, the pine tar being the most\r\nextensively employed. While the different wood tars contain numerous\r\naromatic compounds, such as phenols, phenyl oxides, terpenes and organic\r\nacids, these are present in such a slight proportion so as to render\r\ntheir effectiveness practically useless. It has, therefore, been tried\r\nto use these various compounds contained in the tar themselves to make\r\ntar soap really effective, yet tar is so cheap a substance that it is\r\nusually the substance used for medicating a tar soap. About 10 per cent.\r\nof tar is usually added to the soap with 2 ounces of lamp black per\r\nhundred pounds of soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOAPS CONTAINING PHENOLS.\r\n\r\nPhenol (Carbolic Acid) is most extensively used in soaps of this kind,\r\nwhich are called carbolic soaps. Carbolic soaps are generally colored\r\ngreen and contain from 1 to 5 per cent. phenol crystals.\r\n\r\nThe cresols are also extensively used for making soaps named carbolic.\r\nThese substances impart more odor to the soap and really have more\r\ndisinfecting powers than phenol when incorporated with soap.\r\n\r\nOther soaps, containing the phenol group, which are well known are\r\nresorcinol soap, salol soap, thymol soap, naphthol soap, etc. From one\r\nto five per cent of the compound after which the soap is named is\r\nusually incorporated with the soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEROXIDE SOAP.\r\n\r\nHydrogen peroxide in itself is an excellent disinfectant. It loses all\r\nits medicinal value, however, when added to the soap. To overcome this\r\nobjection various metallic peroxides are added to the soap, as sodium\r\nperoxide, zinc peroxide and barium peroxide. These generate hydrogen\r\nperoxide by the addition of water. Sodium perborate is also used in\r\nperoxide soaps, as this substance is decomposed by water into hydrogen\r\nperoxide and sodium metaborate.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY SOAPS.\r\n\r\nMercuric chloride (corrosive sublimate) is most extensively used for the\r\nproduction of mercury soaps. Because of its extremely poisonous\r\nproperties care should be taken in using it. Since it really eventually\r\nloses any antiseptic value in the soap through forming an insoluble\r\nmercury soap it might better be omitted entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESS IMPORTANT MEDICINAL SOAPS.\r\n\r\nWhile the above mentioned soaps are probably the best known medicated\r\nsoaps, there are numerous other soaps which may be classed under these\r\nkinds of soaps. Thus we have cold cream soap, which can be made by\r\nadding Russian Mineral Oil, 1 to 5 per cent., to the soap; witch hazel\r\nsoap, made by the addition of extract of witch hazel; iodine soap, made\r\nby adding iodine or iodoform; formaldehyde soap, made by adding\r\nformaldehyde; tannin soaps, made by adding tannin. In fact, there have\r\nbeen incorporated in soap so great a number of substances that the list\r\nmight be greatly enlarged.\r\n\r\nMedicated soaps are not only used in solid form, but in powder, paste\r\nand liquid soap as well. The only difference in a soap like those just\r\nreferred to is that the medicant is incorporated with these forms of\r\nsoaps as convenience directs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTILE SOAP.\r\n\r\nA pure castile soap should be made from olive oil. This, however, is not\r\nalways the case, as a number of oils as well as tallow are used to\r\nadulterate this oil to cheapen it, and there are even some soaps called\r\ncastile which contain no olive oil at all. Most of the pure castile soap\r\nused in this country is imported, as it is a difficult matter for the\r\nAmerican manufacturer to compete with the pure imported castile soap,\r\nsince both labor and oil itself are so much cheaper in the vicinities of\r\nEurope where this oil is produced, that this advantage is more than\r\ncompensated by the carrying and custom charges by importing the castile\r\nsoap.\r\n\r\nCastile soap may be made either by the full boiled or cold process.\r\nThere are numerous grades of olive oil, and those used for soap making\r\nare denatured to lower the duty charges. Olive oil makes a hard white\r\nsoap, usually sold in bars, and olive oil foots a green soap, due to the\r\ncoloring matter contained in this oil.\r\n\r\nTo make a boiled castile soap, a composition of 10 per cent. Cochin\r\ncocoanut oil and 90 per cent. olive oil may be used. To cheapen this,\r\npeanut oil (Arachis oil) may entirely replace the olive oil, or about 20\r\nper cent. of corn or soya bean oil may be added. The oils are saponified\r\nas usual in making a settled soap and to prevent rancidity the soap is\r\nboiled near the finish for some time in the closed state with\r\nsufficient excess of alkali to give it a sharp taste, then grained with\r\nlye, the lye drawn off, closed with water and then grained with salt.\r\nThis process is repeated until the desired strength is reached. The last\r\ngraining should not be too great, and on the last change the soap should\r\nnot be thinned out, as it will contain too great a quantity of water\r\nwhen slabbed.\r\n\r\nIn making a cold castile soap the usual method is pursued as already\r\ndirected under cold made soap. When the soap is taken from the crutcher\r\nit is advisable, however, to keep the soap in the frame well covered to\r\nassure complete saponification. Some manufacturers use very small frames\r\nwhich are placed into compartments, well insulated to retain heat.\r\nSeveral formulae for cold made castile soaps, follow. It may be noted\r\nthat some of these contain practically no olive oil.\r\n\r\n                 I\r\n\r\n    Olive oil                        2030\r\n    Palm kernel                       674\r\n    Soda lye, 35 per cent.

It is therefore necessary to keep the\r\ntemperature as low as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nESCHWEGER SOAP (BLUE MOTTLED).\r\n\r\nEschweger soap is a colored mottled or marbled soap made to a very\r\nslight extent in this country. Inasmuch as it has been introduced to the\r\nexport trade, it is made for this purpose by some manufacturers. A high\r\npercentage of cocoanut oil is usually used together with tallow and\r\ngrease. About one-third of each is a typical formula. In a soap of this\r\ncharacter the fact that cocoanut oil soap takes up a large quantity of\r\nwater and salts of various kinds and is difficult to salt out is made\r\nuse of. The tallow and grease are first saponified as usual, then the\r\ncocoanut oil is pumped and saponified. When the saponification is nearly\r\ncompleted either silicate or carbonate of soda or common salt are added\r\nto make the soap \"short\" so as to form the mottle. The finishing of a\r\nsoap of this type can only be gained by practice and it is rather\r\ndifficult to explain the exact appearance of the kettle at this stage.\r\nThe surface of the soap should be bright and lustrous with the steam\r\nescaping in numerous places in rose-like formation. A sample on the\r\ntrowel should have a slight sharpness to the tongue and be plastic. When\r\nthe soap slides from the trowel it should break short. When the soap has\r\nreached this stage the desired coloring matter, usually ultramarine, is\r\nadded to the soap either in the kettle or crutcher and the soap framed.\r\nThe yield is 200-215 pounds per hundred pounds of stock.\r\n\r\nSeveral modifications of this general method for Eschweger soap are used\r\nby adopting the half boiled or cold process.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPARENT SOAP.\r\n\r\nTransparent soap is really not a most desirable soap for toilet\r\npurposes, as it contains an excess of free alkali. It has, nevertheless,\r\nmet with public approval because of the fact it is novel in being\r\ntransparent. Except for this fact very little merit can be claimed for a\r\nsoap of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe transparency of soap is generally due to the presence of alcohol,\r\nsugar or glycerine in the soap when it is made. It is very essential in\r\na soap of this character, where lightness and clearness of color are\r\ndesired, that the material for making the soap be carefully selected as\r\nto color and purity. The perfumes also play an important part in the\r\ncolor of the soap and many of the tinctures, balsams and infusions used\r\nin perfuming soap may eventually cause trouble by spotting. If the soap\r\nis artificially colored, which is almost always the case, the dyestuffs\r\nused for this purpose should have careful attention and only those\r\nshould be used which are known to resist the action of alkalis. Where\r\nrosin is used this product must be of the better grade. Distilled water\r\nis always preferable for use in transparent soap. The government permits\r\nthe use of a specially denatured alcohol. This alcohol is not taxed and\r\nconsists of grain (ethyl) alcohol denatured with 5 per cent. wood\r\n(methyl) alcohol. Some soapmakers prefer to use a more expensive refined\r\nmethyl alcohol, but outside of adding to the cost of the soap, there is\r\nno particular advantage. The glycerine should be chemically pure. As to\r\nthe oils and fats these should be low in acid and of good color. Under\r\nno circumstances should the crutcher or kettle in which the soap is made\r\nbe rusty or unclean in any way. For a light soap enameled utensils are\r\nto be preferred.\r\n\r\nTo obtain transparency in soap the following general methods may be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n1. Where the transparency is due to sugar.\r\n\r\n2. Where alcohol and glycerine produce transparency.\r\n\r\n3. Where (1) or (2) is supplemented by the use of castor oil.\r\n\r\n4. Where transparency depends upon the percentage of fatty acid in a\r\nsoap and the number of times the soap is milled.\r\n\r\nUnder the first method at least 25 per cent. of the charge should be\r\ncocoanut oil, the other constituent being tallow or any fat or oil\r\ncapable of giving a sufficiently hard soap. The soap is boiled and\r\nfinished as usual, then run to the crutcher to be mixed with a strong\r\ncane sugar solution, containing 10-20 per cent. sugar of the weight of\r\nthe soap. The sugar is dissolved in its own weight of water and the\r\nsolution heated to 175 degs. F. before being very slowly added to the\r\nsoap. As the water evaporates, soaps of this type show spots due to the\r\nsugar thus being thrown out of solution.\r\n\r\nTransparent soap made under the second method may be saponified as usual\r\nand consist of any good toilet base. The soap is run to the crutcher and\r\nmixed with 95 per cent. alcohol in the proportion of one part alcohol to\r\ntwo parts of fatty acid contained in the soap together with glycerine in\r\nthe same proportion.\r\n\r\nBy the third method castor oil alone may be used to make the soap or\r\nadded to any of the above bases up to 33-1/3 per cent. of the charge. If\r\ncastor oil only is used, but 2 per cent. or 3 per cent. of sugar is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nIn the last method a combination of 80 per cent. tallow, very low in\r\nfree acid, 20 per cent. cocoanut oil and 5 per cent. W. W. rosin is a\r\nsuitable charge. The saponification and finishing is carried out as with\r\na full boiled soap. The soap is then placed into a jacketed vessel,\r\nprovided with dry-steam coils, by which the excess water is evaporated\r\nfrom the soap until it contains 73 per cent. fatty acids. When the thick\r\nmass reaches this stage it is framed and when cool is suitable for\r\nobtaining a semi transparency which now depends upon the number of times\r\nthe soap is milled, it being, of course, inferred that no solid matter\r\nof any sort be added to the soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD MADE TRANSPARENT SOAP.\r\n\r\nWhile transparent soaps may be made by the above general methods they\r\nare usually made by the semi-boiled or cold process. By this process a\r\nmore satisfactory soap is obtained and it is more simple to carry out. A\r\ndetailed description of this method is best and most easily given by\r\nusing a typical formula.\r\n\r\n    Charge:\r\n\r\n      Tallow                       193-1/2 lbs.\r\n      Cochin Cocoanut Oil          169-1/2 \"\r\n      Castor Oil                    89-1/2 \"\r\n      Soda Ash                       7-3/4 \"\r\n      Soda Lye, 36 degs.

F. Then add the soda ash dissolved in about 30\r\npounds of the water, after which the lye is added and the mass stirred\r\nuntil a finger or stick run over the surface leaves an imprint. Where\r\nthe soap has reached this stage, it is well covered and allowed to stand\r\nabout two hours or until it bulges in the center, after which the rest\r\nof the water which should contain no lime or other mineral substance and\r\nwhich is preferably distilled water, is added. The sugar is then slowly\r\nshoveled in while the mass is stirring and finally the alcohol is poured\r\nin. The heat is then increased to 160 degs. F. by dry steam and the soap\r\ncrutched until dissolved. Under no circumstances should any soap be\r\nallowed to remain above the surface of the mass on the sides of the\r\nmixer. This crutching operation consumes about one hour, and when\r\nfinished the soap should stand in the vessel about half an hour when a\r\nsmall sample is taken out to cool. This sample should be clear and show\r\nan excess of alkali. If it is not clear more alcohol is added, if not of\r\nsufficient strength more lye put in until the desired condition is\r\nreached. The perfume and color are now added.\r\n\r\nThe soap is then framed and allowed to set after which it is cut,\r\nallowed to dry slightly and then pressed. To obtain a polished cake\r\ntransparent soaps are often planed before pressing and after pressing\r\npolished with a soft cloth, dampened with alcohol. Instead of framing\r\nthis soap, it is sometimes \"tubed,\" that is to say, the soap from the\r\ncrutcher is run into specially constructed tubes of a shape near that of\r\nthe desired cake and allowed to cool, after which it is cut and pressed.\r\nAll scraps are returned to the crutcher, but in so doing the soap is\r\nslightly darkened in color. It is advisable to expose a finished cake of\r\ntransparent soap to the air for some time as by so doing it becomes\r\nclearer.\r\n\r\nOther formulae for cold made transparent soaps made as just outlined\r\nfollow:\r\n\r\n                      I.\r\n    Bleached Tallow                134 lbs.\r\n    Cochin Cocoanut Oil             88  \"\r\n    Castor Oil                      20  \"\r\n    W.

To be a good shaving soap the lather produced therefrom\r\nmust be heavy, creamy, but not gummy, and remain moist when formed on\r\nthe face. The soap itself should be of a soft consistency so as to\r\nreadily adhere to the face when used in stick form. It should\r\nfurthermore be neutral or nearly so to prevent the alkali from smarting\r\nduring shaving.\r\n\r\nShaving soap is made in the form of a stick, and a tablet for use in the\r\nshaving mug. Some shavers prefer to have the soap as a powder or cream,\r\nwhich are claimed to be more convenient methods of shaving. While a\r\nliquid shaving soap is not as well known because it has not yet become\r\npopular, some soap for shaving is made in this form.\r\n\r\nFormerly shaving soap was extensively made from a charge of about 80\r\nparts tallow and 20 parts cocoanut oil as a boiled settled soap, but\r\neither making the strengthening change with potash lye or using potash\r\nlye in saponifying the stock and graining with salt. Soaps for shaving\r\nmade in this manner are very unsatisfactory, as they do not produce a\r\nsufficiently thick or lasting lather and discolor very materially upon\r\nageing. Potassium stearate forms an ideal lather for shaving, but\r\nreadily hardens and hence needs some of the softer oils, or glycerine\r\nincorporated with it to form a satisfactory soap for shaving.\r\n\r\nThe selection of materials for making a shaving soap is important. The\r\ntallow used should be white and of high titer. Cochin cocoanut oil is to\r\nbe preferred to the other kinds, and the alkalis should be the best for\r\ntechnical use that can be purchased--76 per cent. caustic soda and 88-92\r\nper cent. caustic potash are suitable. By the use of stearic acid it is\r\na simple matter to reach the neutral point which can be carefully\r\napproximated.\r\n\r\nThe following are shaving soap formulae which have been found to give\r\ngood satisfaction:\r\n\r\n                      I.       lbs.\r\n    Tallow                         360\r\n    Stearic acid                    40\r\n    Soda lye, 41deg.

B.           182\r\n    Caustic potash, 38deg. B.         108\r\n\r\nTo proceed, first run into the crutcher the tallow, cocoanut oil and\r\nbayberry wax when used, and bring the temperature of the mass up to\r\n140deg.-160deg. F. by dry steam. Then add the caustic soda lye and keep on\r\nheat with occasional mixing until it is all taken up. When this stage is\r\nreached gradually add all but about 5 per cent. of the potash lye, and\r\ncomplete the saponification. This point having been reached, the heat is\r\nturned off; the crutcher is run and the stearic acid, previously melted\r\nby dry steam in a lead-lined or enameled vessel, is run in in a\r\ncontinuous stream and the crutching continued for fifteen minutes to\r\nhalf an hour. Samples are taken at this time, cooled and tested by\r\nalcoholic phenolphthalein solution. If too alkaline more stearic acid is\r\nadded, if too acid more potash lye from that previously reserved. After\r\neach addition of lye or stearic acid the mass is crutched from 10 to 15\r\nminutes longer, another sample is taken, cooled and again tested. When\r\nthe phenolphthalein shows a very light pink after several minutes, the\r\nsoap is practically neutral, although at this point one can better judge\r\nby dissolving a sample in hot neutralized alcohol made by putting into\r\nthe alcohol a few drops of phenolphthalein, and then adding weak alkali\r\ndrop by drop from a burette until a slight pink, not yellow, tint is\r\nobtained, and noting the color of the solution. The solution should show\r\na very light pink when the soap is properly neutralized. When this stage\r\nis arrived at the gum tragacanth, previously softened in water, is\r\ncrutched in if it is to be added. The soap is then framed, stripped in\r\nthree or four days, dried and milled.\r\n\r\nThe formulae as given are for shaving sticks, and do not readily press\r\nunless thoroughly dried. A more satisfactory result is obtained by\r\nadding at the mill 25 per cent. of white tallow base to obtain a\r\nsatisfactory mug soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAVING POWDER.\r\n\r\nShaving powder differs from the soaps just described in being\r\npulverized, usually adding up to 5 per cent. starch to prevent caking.\r\nAny of the above soaps, dried bone dry, with or without the addition of\r\ntallow base make a satisfactory powder for shaving.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAVING CREAM.\r\n\r\nShaving cream is now a very popular shaving medium due to the rapidity\r\nand convenience with which one can shave by the use of this product.\r\nFormerly shaving cream was made from the liquid oils like olive oil and\r\na soft fat like lard, together with cocoanut oil. Now, however, most of\r\nthe popular shaving creams are made from stearic acid and cocoanut oil,\r\nas a far superior product is obtained by the use of these substances. By\r\nusing these a more satisfactory cream is obtained, and it is far more\r\nconvenient to make. The lather also produced therefrom is more suitable\r\nfor shaving, being thick, creamy and remaining moist.\r\n\r\nA few typical formulae for shaving creams of this type are as follows:\r\n\r\n                          I.       lbs.\r\n    Cochin cocoanut oil             26\r\n    Stearic acid                   165\r\n    Caustic potash lye, 50deg.

F. A part or all the potash lye is then added and the\r\ncocoanut oil saponified. The rest of the potash lye and the water are\r\nthen added, and with the mixer running the stearic acid, previously\r\nmelted in a lead-lined or enameled vessel, is then poured in in a stream\r\nand the mass stirred until smooth, care being exercised not to aerate it\r\ntoo much. The cream is then tested for alkalinity, the best method being\r\nby that described under shaving soap, in which the sample is dissolved\r\nin alcohol. Because of the large quantity of water present,\r\nphenolphthalein is unsatisfactory, as dissociation of the soap may show\r\na pink indication in spite of the fact the mass is on the acid side. For\r\na quick method of testing the bite on the tongue is a satisfactory\r\ncriterion. If a cooled sample bites the tongue more stearic acid is\r\nadded until there is a 3% excess of this. When the proper neutralization\r\nhas taken place the cream is perfumed and framed in a special frame, or\r\nit may be allowed to cool in the mixer and perfumed the next day. When\r\ncool the cream is strained, or put through an ointment mill, after which\r\nit is ready to fill into tubes.\r\n\r\nThe procedure for the first part of Formula III is the same as that just\r\ngiven. The second part of the formula is made the same as a vanishing\r\ncream for toilet purposes. To make this, first melt the stearic acid as\r\nalready directed. Dissolve the sodium carbonate and borax in water and\r\nwhen dissolved add the glycerine and stir. Then heat this solution to\r\nabout 100deg.-120deg. F. and while stirring in a suitable mixing machine\r\ninto which this solution has been poured after being heated, or better\r\nstill in which it has been heated by dry steam, add the stearic acid.\r\nContinue mixing until smooth and then allow to cool, or run into frames\r\nto cool.\r\n\r\nWhen the shaving cream and vanishing cream are both cool, they are mixed\r\nin the proportion of one of the former to two of the latter. It is\r\nclaimed that in thus making a shaving cream a smoother product is\r\nobtained, although it may be said that the vanishing cream is merely a\r\nsoft soap and the ultimate result is the same as though the various\r\ningredients were added in one operation, rather than making two separate\r\nproducts and then mixing them, thereby considerably increasing the cost\r\nof manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUMICE OR SAND SOAPS.\r\n\r\nPumice and sand are at times added to soap to aid in the removal of dirt\r\nin cleansing the hands. In some cases these soaps are made in the form\r\nof a cake, in others they are sold in cans in the form of a paste.\r\n\r\nA hand paste is usually made by merely dissolving ordinary tallow base\r\nin two or three times its weight of hot water and mixing in the desired\r\nquantity of pumice or sand and in some instances adding a little\r\nglycerine to keep it soft or a solvent of some kind for grease. It may\r\nalso be made by directly incorporating any of these in a potash soap.\r\n\r\nA cold made or semi-boiled cocoanut or palm kernel oil soap is the base\r\nused to add the pumice or sand to in making a cake soap of this sort.\r\nThe following formulae serve as a guide for these soaps.\r\n\r\n                       I.\r\n\r\n    Palm Kernel or Ceylon Cocoanut Oil      705 lbs.\r\n    Pumice (Powdered)                       281 \"\r\n    Soda Lye, 38deg.

F. Sift in the\r\npumice and mix thoroughly. The lye is then added which causes a curdling\r\nof the grain. The stirring is continued until the grain closes and the\r\nsoap is smooth, after which the desired perfume is added and the soap\r\ndropped into a frame and crutched by hand. When the soap is set, it is\r\nslabbed, cut into cakes, dried slightly and pressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIQUID SOAPS.\r\n\r\nLiquid soaps are merely solutions of a potash soap, usually cocoanut oil\r\nsoap, although corn oil is used to make a cheap soap. One of the\r\ndifficulties encountered in liquid soap is to keep it clear. At a low\r\ntemperature a sediment is often formed, but this can be overcome by the\r\nuse of sugar and filtering the soap through a filter press at a low\r\ntemperature. In order to prevent the soap from freezing, it is necessary\r\nto lower the freezing point by the addition of glycerine or alcohol.\r\n\r\nTo make liquid soap by any of the formulae given below, the oil is first\r\nrun into a jacketed kettle with a stirring device, and heated to about\r\n120deg. F. The potash lye is then added and the oil saponified. When the\r\nsaponification takes place, especially when cocoanut oil is used, the\r\nmass swells rapidly and may foam over the sides of the kettle unless\r\nwater is used to check this, or a kettle of about four to five times the\r\ncapacity of the total charge of soap is used. When the saponification\r\nhas occurred, the sugar, borax and glycerine are added, the water run in\r\nand the mixture stirred until the soap is thoroughly dissolved. Heat\r\naids materially in dissolving the soap. The soap is then allowed to cool\r\nand if color or perfume is to be added this is stirred in, after which\r\nthe soap is cooled and filtered or else run directly into barrels.\r\n\r\nTallow is not suitable for making a clear liquid soap since it is too\r\nhigh in stearine which when formed into the stearate makes an opaque\r\nsolution. The formulae herewith given have been found to give good\r\npractical results.\r\n\r\n                   I.               lbs.\r\n    Cocoanut oil                    130\r\n    Caustic potash lye, 28deg.

It is\r\npossible, of course, to either increase or decrease the percentage of\r\nfatty acid by varying the amount of water. The water used in making\r\nliquid soaps, of course, should be soft, for hard water forms insoluble\r\nsoaps which precipitate and cause a sediment.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF HARDENED OILS IN TOILET SOAPS.\r\n\r\nWhile the introduction of the hydrogenation of oils is a decided advance\r\nin the production of suitable cheaper oils for soap making,\r\ncomparatively little hardened oil is employed for soap making in America\r\nup to the present time. In Europe, however, considerable advance has\r\nbeen made by the use of such oils for manufacturing soap therefrom and a\r\nnumber of plants turn out large quantities of hydrogenated oils for soap\r\nmaking as well as for edible purposes. Recently a company has been\r\nformed in this country for hardening oils and it is very probable that\r\nthe future will see this material extensively used in our own country,\r\nas these appear to be the one present hope of the soap manufacturer as a\r\ncheck on the ever increasing cost of fats and oils now used in making\r\nsoap.\r\n\r\nIt is an unfortunate condition that hydrogenated oils produced abroad\r\nare sold under names which give absolutely no indication as to the oil\r\nwhich has been hardened. The softer and cheaper oils like fish oil,\r\nlinseed oil, cottonseed oil, etc., are generally hardened for soap\r\nmanufacture to different degrees of hardness. While it is impossible to\r\ndefinitely state just what products as Candelite, Talgol, Krutolin or\r\nseveral other coined names of hardened oils are, various investigators\r\nhave experimented with them as to their adaptability for producing\r\ntoilet soaps and found that suitable toilet soaps may be made from them.\r\nWhile many objections were at first met with concerning soaps made from\r\nthese products, as to their unsatisfactory saponification, the poor\r\nlathering quality of the soaps and their odor and consequent difficulty\r\nin perfuming, the results of most investigators along these lines\r\nindicate that these in many cases were due to prejudice against or\r\nunfamiliarity with handling oils of this type for soap making.\r\n\r\nIn manufacturing soap from hardened oils it is usually necessary to\r\nincorporate with the charge lard, tallow, tallow oil or some other soft\r\noil of this nature. Satisfactory bases for toilet soaps, made as boiled\r\nsettled soap by the use of Talgol (undoubtedly hardened fish oil), are\r\nsaid to be made by the formulae[10] below.\r\n\r\n              I.\r\n\r\n    Tallow                  45 parts\r\n    Talgol                  40 \"\r\n    Cocoanut Oil            15 \"\r\n\r\n              II.\r\n\r\n    Cocoanut Oil (Ceylon)    6 \"\r\n    Tallow                  12 \"\r\n    Talgol, Extra           12 \"\r\n\r\nThe method of boiling a soap of this type does not differ materially\r\nfrom that of making settled tallow soap base. The soap itself has a\r\ndifferent odor than a straight tallow base, but is said to make a very\r\nsatisfactory soap for milling and to be of good appearance.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory transparent soaps are made from the hardened oil Candelite,\r\nwhich replaces the tallow in transparent soap formulae such as have\r\nalready been given in the section under \"Transparent Soaps.\" The method\r\nof manufacturing a soap by the use of this product varies in no way from\r\nthe usual method employed for making these soaps.\r\n\r\nSince hydrogenated oils are high in stearine, their use in shaving soaps\r\nis a decided advantage. It has previously been pointed out that\r\npotassium stearate forms an ideal lather for shaving, and in the\r\nhydrogenating process the olein is converted to stearine. Thus a\r\nhardened oil is advantageous in a shaving soap. As an example of a cold\r\nmade soap for shaving the following may be taken.[11]\r\n\r\n    Talgol Extra            50 lbs.\r\n    Cocoanut Oil            10 \"\r\n    Lard                    10 \"\r\n    Soda Lye, 38deg.

For woolen fabrics it is used for scouring, fulling and\r\nthrowing the wool; in the silk industry it is necessary for degumming\r\nthe raw silk, as well as for dyeing; in the cotton mills it is used to\r\nfinish cotton cloth and to some extent in bleaching; it is, furthermore,\r\nemployed in a number of ways in the manufacture of linen. Large\r\nquantities of soap are thus consumed in an industry of so great an\r\nextent and the requirements necessitate different soaps for the\r\ndifferent operations. We will, therefore, consider these in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOURING AND FULLING SOAPS FOR WOOL.\r\n\r\nThe soaps used to scour wool and for fulling the woven cloth are usually\r\nmade as cheaply as possible. They are, however, generally pure soaps, as\r\nfilling material such as sodium silicate does not readily rinse out of\r\nthe wool and if used at all must be added very sparingly. Both cold made\r\nand boiled settled soaps are made for this purpose. The soap is\r\ngenerally sold in barrels, hence is run directly to these from the\r\ncrutcher or soap kettle. As cold made soaps the following serve for wool\r\nscouring or fulling.\r\n\r\n                 I.\r\n\r\n    Palm Oil                         200 lbs.\r\n    Bone Grease                      460 \"\r\n    Soda Lye, 36deg.

When this stage is reached, sufficient lye\r\nis added to strengthen the kettle strongly. It is then boiled down with\r\nclosed steam on salt brine or \"pickle\" until a sample of the lye taken\r\nfrom the bottom stands at 16deg.-22deg. B. The soap is then run into\r\nbarrels and after standing therein for a day is hand crutched until cool\r\nto prevent streaking of the soap.\r\n\r\nBesides a soap of this type a settled tallow chip soap is used.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOL THROWER'S SOAP.\r\n\r\nSoaps for wool throwing are sometimes made from olive oil foots but\r\nthese are often objected to because of the sulphur-like odor conveyed to\r\nthe cloth due to the method by which this oil is extracted with carbon\r\ndisulphide. A potash soap hardened somewhat with soda is also used. As a\r\nformula for a suitable soap of this type this may be given.\r\n\r\n    Olive Oil Foots              12   parts\r\n    Corn Oil                     46     \"\r\n    House Grease                 20     \"\r\n    Soda Lye, 36deg.

The kettle is boiled with open and closed\r\nsteam, adding water very slowly and aiming to obtain a 220-225 per cent.\r\nyield or fatty acid content of the finished soap of 46 per cent. When\r\nthe soap is finished a sample cooled on a plate of glass should be\r\nneither slippery or short, but should string slightly. The finished soap\r\nis run directly into barrels.\r\n\r\nA soap for wool throwing by the semi-boiled process may be made from\r\nolive oil foots in a crutcher thus:\r\n\r\n    Olive Oil Foots          600 lbs.\r\n    Potash Lye, 20deg.

F., the lye added and the mass stirred until\r\nit bunches, when it is dropped into barrels.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORSTED FINISHING SOAPS.\r\n\r\nFor the finishing of worsted cloth soaps high in cocoanut oil or palm\r\nkernel oil are preferred. These soaps are finished very neutral, being\r\nmade as settled soaps, but given an extra wash change after\r\nstrengthening strongly. They are then finished as usual and run into\r\nbarrels. If framed too hot, the high percentage of cocoanut oil causes\r\nmottling, which is prevented by crutching by hand until the temperature\r\nof the soap is 140deg.-145deg. F. Some typical charges, all of which are\r\nsaponified with soda lye, follow:\r\n\r\n                    I.\r\n\r\n    Palm Kernel Oil                      60 parts\r\n    Corn Oil                             40 \"\r\n\r\n                    II.\r\n\r\n    Palm Kernel Oil                      30 \"\r\n    Red Oil (single pressed)             70 \"\r\n\r\n                    III.\r\n\r\n    Red Oil                              33-1/3 \"\r\n    Corn Oil                             33-1/3 \"\r\n    Cocoanut Oil or Palm Kernel Oil      33-1/3 \"\r\n\r\n\r\nSOAPS USED IN THE SILK INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\nSoap is used to a very large extent in silk mills, both for degumming\r\nthe raw silk and in silk dyeing. Raw silk consists of the true silk\r\nfibre known as fibroin and a gummy coating, sericin, which dulls the\r\nlustre of the silk unless removed. For this purpose a slightly alkaline\r\nolive oil foots soap is best adapted, although palm oil and peanut oil\r\nsoaps are sometimes used, as well as soaps made from a combination of\r\nhouse grease to the extent of 30 per cent., together with red oil or\r\nstraight olein soaps, both of which are artificially colored green. In\r\nusing house grease, if 30 per cent. is exceeded in combination with red\r\noil, the titer is raised to such an extent that the soap does not\r\nreadily rinse from the silk nor dissolve readily. They are also not\r\nadvisable because they impart a disagreeable odor to the silk.\r\n\r\nTo make a soap for this purpose from olive oil foots it is made as a\r\nsettled soap, care being taken to thoroughly boil the mass on the\r\nsaponification change in the closed state to assure proper\r\nsaponification. The kettle is usually grained with lye and given a good\r\nwash change to remove the excess strength. The change previous to the\r\nfinish should not be too heavy or too large a nigre results. The lighter\r\nthe grain is, the better the finished kettle is. A yield of 150 per\r\ncent. is usually obtained. This soap is generally run to a frame,\r\nslabbed upon cooling and packed directly into wooden cases.\r\n\r\nFor silk dyeing the above soap is suitable, although any well-made soap\r\nof good odor and not rancid is useable. While soap alone is often used\r\nin the bath for silk dyeing, certain dyestuffs require the addition of\r\nacetic or sulphuric acid, which sets free the fatty acids. If these be\r\nof bad odor it is taken up by the silk and is difficult to remove. The\r\nmost generally used soaps are the just mentioned olive foots soap or a\r\nsoap made from a good grade red oil.\r\n\r\nBoth kinds are extensively used.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOAPS USED FOR COTTON GOODS.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of cotton goods, as compared to the wool and silk\r\nindustries, very much less soap is used and it is only applied to the\r\nfinished fabric either to clean the cloth preparatory to dyeing or to\r\naid in dyeing with certain colors. It is also used in calico printing.\r\nFor cleansing the cloth ordinary chip soap is suitable although a more\r\nalkaline soap finished as a curd soap is an advantage in that the free\r\nalkali contained therein aids in removing the dirt and has no harmful\r\neffect on the cotton. For dyeing cotton goods or to brighten certain\r\ncolors after dyeing an olive oil foots soap is most generally employed.\r\nIn calico printing soap is used to wash and clear the cloth after\r\nprinting. A soap for this purpose should be easily soluble in water and\r\ncontain no free alkali, rosin or filler. The best soaps for use in\r\ncalico printing are either an olive oil foots soap or an olein soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULPHONATED OILS.\r\n\r\nWhile sulphonated oils are not used to any great extent in the\r\nmanufacture of soap, they are used very largely in the dyeing and\r\nprinting of turkey and alizarine reds on cotton as well as other colors.\r\nJust what action these oils have is not known. Turkey red oil or\r\nsulphonated castor oil is the best known sulphonated oil.\r\n\r\nThe process of making these oils is simple. The equipment necessary is a\r\nwooden tank or barrel of suitable capacity, approximately two and a half\r\ntimes the amount of oil to be treated. There are furthermore required\r\nother tanks or vessels to hold the solutions used such as caustic soda,\r\nammonia and acid. The tank to be used for the preparation of sulphonated\r\noil should be provided with a valve at the bottom of the tank and a\r\ngauge to measure the quantity of liquid therein.\r\n\r\nThe process is carried out as follows:\r\n\r\nThree hundred pounds of castor oil are placed in the tank and 80 pounds\r\nat 66 deg. B. sulphuric acid are weighed out in another vessel. The acid\r\nis run into the tank containing the oil in a very thin stream while the\r\noil is well stirred. At no time should the temperature exceed 40 deg. C.\r\nThis operation should consume at least an hour and stirring should be\r\ncontinued half an hour longer to insure the thorough mixing of the oil\r\nwith the acid. The mass is then allowed to settle for 24 hours, after\r\nwhich 40 gallons of water are added and the mixture stirred until it has\r\na uniform creamy color indicating no dark streaks. This mixing process\r\nshould be carefully carried out and when completed allowed to settle 36\r\nhours. At this point the mass will have separated into two layers, the\r\nlower layer consisting of a water solution of acid and the upper layer\r\nof oil. The former is run out through the valve located at the bottom of\r\nthe tank. Another wash may now be given or dispensed with as desired. In\r\nthis wash the addition of salt or sodium sulphate at the rate of 1-1/2\r\npounds per gallon of water is advisable. A 24 deg. B. caustic soda\r\nsolution is prepared and added slowly to the acidified oil with constant\r\nstirring. The mass first turns creamy, then becomes streaked, increasing\r\nin streaks as the caustic solution is poured in, and finally becomes\r\nclear and transparent. Water is now added to bring the volume to 75\r\ngallons. The oil is now milky in appearance, but the addition of a\r\nlittle more soda solution restores the transparency.\r\n\r\nIn some cases ammonia is used in addition to caustic soda in\r\nneutralizing the oil. Three-fourths of the amount of caustic soda\r\nrequired to complete the neutralization is first added and then the\r\nneutralization is completed with a one to one liquid ammonia and water\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Seifensieder Ztg., 40, 47, 1266 (1913).\r\n\r\n[10] Seifensieder Ztg.

No soap plant is, therefore, fully\r\nequipped unless it has some method whereby the glycerine is recovered\r\nand the importance of recovering this product cannot be too strongly\r\nemphasized.\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that neutral fats or the glycerides are\r\na combination of fatty acid with glycerine. These are split apart in the\r\nprocess of saponification. While by the term _saponification_ as used in\r\nsoap making it is inferred that this is the combination of caustic\r\nalkalis with the fatty acids to form soap, this term is by no means\r\nlimited to this method of saponification, as there are various other\r\nmethods of saponifying a fat. The chemical definition of saponification\r\nis the conversion of an ester, of which glycerides are merely a certain\r\ntype, into an alcohol and an acid or a salt of this acid. Thus, if we\r\nuse caustic alkali as our saponifying agent for a fat or oil, we obtain\r\nthe sodium or potassium salt of the higher fatty acids or soap and the\r\nalcohol, glycerine. On the other hand, if we use a mineral acid as the\r\nsaponifying agent, we obtain the fatty acids themselves in addition to\r\nglycerine. While the former is by far the most generally employed for\r\nmaking soap, other processes consist in saponifying the fats by some\r\nmethod other than caustic alkalis and then converting the fatty acids\r\ninto soap by either neutralizing them with sodium or potassium carbonate\r\nor hydrate.\r\n\r\nIt is important to again point out here that fats and oils develop free\r\nfatty acid of themselves and that the development of this acid\r\nrepresents a loss in glycerine. The selection of an oil or fat for soap\r\nmaking should therefore to a large extent be judged as to its\r\nadaptability by the free fatty acid content, as the higher this content\r\nis, the greater is the loss in the glycerine eventually obtained.\r\nGlycerine often represents the only profit to a soap manufacturer. It is\r\nindeed necessary to determine the percentage of free fatty acid before\r\npurchasing a lot of stock to be made into soap.\r\n\r\nIn taking up the question of glycerine recovery we will consider the\r\nvarious methods thus:\r\n\r\n1. Where the glycerine is obtained from spent lye by saponifying the\r\nfats or oils with caustic alkali.\r\n\r\n2. Where the glycerine is obtained by saponifying the fats or oils by\r\nsome other method than the above, of which there are the following:\r\n\r\n    (a) Twitchell process.\r\n    (b) Saponification by lime in autoclave.\r\n    (c) Saponification by acid.\r\n    (d) Saponification by water in autoclave.\r\n    (e) Fermentative (Enzymes).\r\n    (f) Krebitz process.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOVERY OF GLYCERINE FROM SPENT LYE.\r\n\r\nThe spent lye obtained from the glycerine changes in making soap varies\r\ngreatly, the quality depending upon the stock saponified and the soap\r\nmaker's care in handling the operation. No two lyes run exactly alike as\r\nto proportion of the various ingredients, although they are all similar\r\nin containing the same substances either in solution or suspension.\r\nSpent lye is a water solution of mainly glycerine, free alkali either as\r\ncaustic alkali or carbonate and salt, including sodium sulfate, but\r\nfurthermore contains some soap and albuminous matter either in solution\r\nor suspension. Upon standing in the storage tank the greater part of\r\nthe soap usually separates when the lye cools. In order to assure the\r\ngreatest economical yield of glycerine by saponifying a fat with caustic\r\nsoda it is necessary to obtain a proportion of three parts of water to\r\nevery part of fat made into soap. Test runs have shown that this is the\r\nproper proportion and that it is not economical to greatly exceed this\r\namount, and if a much less proportion is used the full yield of\r\nglycerine is not obtained.\r\n\r\nThe spent lyes contain varying amounts of glycerine, the first change\r\nbeing richest in glycerine content, and this being reduced in the\r\nsubsequent changes. If the lyes always run high in glycerine it is an\r\nindication that it is not all being obtained. The usual percentage is\r\nfrom 0.5% to 5% or even more, although the average is somewhere around\r\n2% to 3%. The lye as it comes from the kettle should not contain any\r\nmore than 0.5% to 0.6% of free alkali calculated as sodium carbonate,\r\nNa_{2}CO_{3}. If the proportion is higher than this, it shows that the\r\nsaponification has been conducted with too high a proportion of alkali,\r\na condition which should be corrected in the kettle room. An excess of\r\nfree alkali does not interfere to any great extent with the successful\r\nrecovery of the glycerine, but is a waste of both alkali and the acid\r\nused in neutralizing this. It is, therefore, more economical to run a\r\nstrong lye over fresh stock and neutralize the alkali thus, rather than\r\ntreating the lye for glycerine recovery.\r\n\r\nBefore the spent lye can be run into the evaporator it is necessary to\r\nremove the albuminous impurities and soap and to neutralize the excess\r\nalkali to between exactly neutral and 0.02% alkalinity. The lye should\r\nnever be fed into the evaporator in the acid condition.\r\n\r\nIn order to treat the spent lyes for evaporation, they are first allowed\r\nto cool in the storage tank, after which any soap which may have\r\nseparated is skimmed off and returned to the soap kettle. This lye is\r\nthen pumped to the treatment tank, an ordinary tank equipped with some\r\nmethod of agitating the liquor, either by a mechanical stirrer, steam\r\nblower or compressed air, until it is about two feet from the top.\r\n\r\nAfter the lye has been skimmed off it is thoroughly agitated and a\r\nsample taken. The amount of lye in the tank is then calculated. Spent\r\nlye is about 1.09 times heavier than water, or weighs about 9 pounds to\r\nthe gallon. While the sample is being tested for alkalinity it is\r\nadvisable to add sulfate of alumina, which may be dissolving while the\r\nsample is being titrated. This substance should be added in the\r\nproportion of anywhere from 6 to 14 pounds per thousand pounds of lye,\r\ndepending upon the amount of impurities contained therein. For a clean\r\nlye six pounds per thousand is sufficient, but for an impure lye a\r\ngreater quantity is necessary. The sulfate of alumina used should be\r\nfree from arsenic and sulfides and should contain a minimum amount of\r\ngrit (silica), as grit reduces the life of the pump valves. This may be\r\nestimated with sufficient accuracy by rubbing the filtered-off portions,\r\ninsoluble in water between the fingers and a plate of glass. The object\r\nof adding the sulfate of alumina is to transform the soap contained in\r\nthe lye into the insoluble aluminum soaps, and at the same time to\r\ncoagulate the albuminous impurities. It must be remembered that the\r\nsulfate of alumina is added only for the fresh lye put into the tank.\r\nThus if there were 10,000 pounds of lye in the treating tank when the\r\nfresh lye was run in, and 50,000 pounds when the tank is filled, adding\r\nnine pounds of sulfate of alumina per thousand of lye, only 360 pounds\r\nwould be added or enough for 40,000 pounds. Sulfate of alumina\r\nneutralizes one-third of its weight of caustic.\r\n\r\nTo determine the alkali in the sample, 10 cubic centimeters are pipetted\r\ninto a beaker, a little distilled water added, then 3 or 4 drops of\r\nphenolphthalein indicator. From a burette, quarter normal (N/4) sulfuric\r\nacid is added until the pink color is just discharged. When this point\r\nis reached 4 to 5 c. c. more of acid are added and the solution is\r\nboiled to expel the carbon dioxide. Should the solution turn pink, it is\r\nnecessary to add more acid. After having boiled for 3 to 4 minutes, N/4\r\ncaustic soda is added until the pink color just returns and the amount\r\nof caustic soda used is read on the burette. The difference between the\r\nnumber of cubic centimeters of N/4 sulfuric acid and N/4 caustic soda\r\ngives the amount of alkali in the sample. By using a 10 c. c. sample and\r\nN/4 sulfuric acid and N/4 caustic soda each c. c. obtained by the\r\ndifference of these two solutions is equal to one-tenth of one per cent.\r\n(0.1%) of the total alkali in the lye. As an example, say we first used\r\n7.7 c. c. of N/4 sulfuric acid to just discharge the pink, then added 4\r\nc. c. more, or 11.7 c. c. in total. After boiling it required 5.3 c. c.\r\nto bring back a slight pink, the total alkalinity would be 11.7 c. c. -\r\n5.3 c. c. = 6.4 c. c., or 0.64% total alkali in the lye in terms of\r\ncaustic soda. If there were 40,000 pounds of lye to be treated then we\r\nshould have to neutralize:\r\n\r\n40,000 x .0064 = 256 lbs. alkali. Since sulfate of alumina neutralizes\r\none-third of its weight in caustic, and there are say 9 lbs. of this\r\nadded per thousand pounds of lye we would add\r\n\r\n40,000 x 9 = 360 lbs. of sulfate of alumina. This would neutralize 360 x\r\n1/3 = 120 lbs of alkali. There are then 256 - 120 = 136 lbs. of alkali\r\nstill to be neutralized. If 60deg. B. sulfuric acid is used it requires\r\nabout 1.54 lbs. of acid to one pound of caustic. Therefore to neutralize\r\nthe caustic soda remaining it requires:\r\n\r\n136 x 1.54 = 209.44 lbs. 60deg. B. sulfuric acid to neutralize the total\r\nalkali in the 40,000 pounds of spent lye.\r\n\r\nThe acid is added and the lye well stirred, after which another sample\r\nis taken and again titrated as before. From this titration the amount of\r\nacid to be added is again calculated and more acid is added if\r\nnecessary. Should too much acid have been added, caustic soda solution\r\nis added until the lye is between exactly neutral and 0.02% alkaline.\r\nThe filtered lyes at this stage have a slight yellowish cast.\r\n\r\nTo be sure that the lyes are treated correctly the precipitation test is\r\nadvisable. To carry this out filter about 50 c. c. of the treated lye\r\nand divide into two portions in a test tube. To one portion add ammonia\r\ndrop by drop. If a cloudiness develops upon shaking, more alkali is\r\nadded to the lye in the tank. To the other portion add a few drops of 1\r\nto 5 sulfuric acid and shake the test tube. If a precipitate develops or\r\nthe solution clouds, more acid is needed. When the lyes are treated\r\nright no cloudiness should develop either upon adding ammonia or the\r\ndilute acid.\r\n\r\nThe properly treated lye is then run through the filter press while\r\nslightly warm and the filtered lye is fed to the evaporator from the\r\nfiltered lye tank. The lye coming from the filter press should be clear\r\nand have a slight yellowish cast. As the pressure increases it is\r\nnecessary to clean the press or some of the press cake will pass through\r\nthe cloths. Where sodium silicate is used as a filler, the silicate\r\nscrap should never be returned to the soap kettle until the glycerine\r\nlyes have been withdrawn. This practice of some soapmakers is to be\r\nstrongly censured, as it causes decided difficulty in filtering the lye,\r\nsince during the treatment of the lye, free silicic acid in colloidal\r\nform is produced by the decomposition of the sodium silicate by acid.\r\nThis often prevents filtering the treated lye even at excess pressure\r\nand at its best retards the filtering.\r\n\r\nAs to the filter press cake, this may be best thrown away in a small\r\nfactory. Where, however, the output of glycerine is very large it pays\r\nto recover both the fatty acids and alumina in the press cakes.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, especially when the lyes are very dirty and the total\r\nresidue in the crude glycerine runs high, for which there is a penalty\r\nusually attached, a double filtration of the lye is advisable. This is\r\ncarried out by first making the lye slightly acid in reaction by the\r\naddition of alum and acid, then filtering. This filtered lye is then\r\nneutralized to the proper point with caustic, as already described, and\r\npassed through the filter press again.\r\n\r\nWhile in the method of treating the lyes as given sulfuric acid is used\r\nfor neutralizing, some operators prefer to use hydrochloric acid, as\r\nthis forms sodium chloride or common salt, whereas sulfuric acid forms\r\nsodium sulfate, having 3/5 the graining power of salt, which eventually\r\nrenders the salt useless for graining the soap, as the percentage of\r\nsodium sulfate increases in the salt. When the salt contains 25 per\r\ncent. sodium sulfate it is advisable to throw it away. Sulfuric acid,\r\nhowever, is considerably cheaper than hydrochloric and this more than\r\ncompensates the necessity of having to eventually reject the recovered\r\nsalt. It may here also be mentioned that recovered salt contains 5-7 per\r\ncent. glycerine which should be washed out in the evaporator before it\r\nis thrown away. The following tables give the approximate theoretical\r\namounts of acids of various strengths required to neutralize one pound\r\nof caustic soda:\r\n\r\nFor 1 pound of caustic soda--\r\n\r\n    3.25 lbs. 18deg. B. hydrochloric (muriatic) acid are required.\r\n    2.92  \"   20deg. B.      \"            \"       \"   \"     \"\r\n    2.58  \"   22deg. B.      \"            \"       \"   \"     \"\r\n\r\nFor 1 pound of caustic soda--\r\n\r\n    1.93 lbs. 50deg. B. sulphuric acid are required.\r\n    1.54  \"   60deg. B.     \"      \"    \"     \"\r\n    1.28  \"   66deg. B.     \"      \"    \"     \"\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, feasible to neutralize the spent lye without first\r\ndetermining the causticity by titrating a sample and this is often the\r\ncase. The operator under such conditions first adds the sulfate of\r\nalumina, then the acid, using litmus paper as his indicator.\r\nComparatively, this method of treatment is much slower and not as\r\npositive, as the amount of acid or alkali to be added is at all times\r\nuncertain, for in the foaming of the lyes their action on litmus is\r\nmisleading.\r\n\r\nAfter the lye has been filtered to the filtered lye tank it is fed to\r\nthe evaporator, the method of operation of which varies somewhat with\r\ndifferent styles or makes. When it first enters the evaporator the lye\r\nis about 11deg.-12deg. B. After boiling the density will gradually rise\r\nto 27deg. B. and remain at this gravity for some time and during which\r\ntime most of the salt is dropped out in the salt filter. As the lye\r\nconcentrates the gravity gradually rises to 28deg.-30deg. B., which is\r\nhalf crude glycerine and contains about 60 per cent. glycerine. Some\r\noperators carry the evaporation to this point and accumulate a quantity\r\nof half crude before going on to crude. After half crude is obtained the\r\ntemperature on the evaporator increases, the vacuum increases and the\r\npressure on the condensation drain goes up (using the same amount of\r\nlive steam). As the liquor grows heavier the amount of evaporation is\r\nless, and less steam is required necessitating the regulation of the\r\nsteam pressure on the drum. When a temperature of 210deg. F. on the\r\nevaporator, with 26 or more inches vacuum on the pump is arrived at, the\r\ncrude stage has been reached and the liquor now contains about 80 per\r\ncent. glycerine in which shape it is usually sold by soap manufacturers.\r\nA greater concentration requires more intricate apparatus. After\r\nsettling a day in the crude tank it is drummed.\r\n\r\nCrude glycerine (about 80 per cent. glycerol) free from salt is 33deg.\r\nB., or has a specific gravity of 1.3. A sample boiled in an open dish\r\nboils at a temperature of 155deg. C. or over.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWITCHELL PROCESS.\r\n\r\nThe Twitchell process of saponification consists of causing an almost\r\ncomplete cleavage of fats and oils by the use of the Twitchell reagent\r\nor saponifier, a sulfo-aromatic compound. This is made by the action of\r\nconcentrated sulfuric acid upon a solution of oleic acid or stearic acid\r\nin an aromatic hydrocarbon. From 0.5 per cent. to 3 per cent. of the\r\nreagent is added and saponification takes place from 12-48 hours by\r\nheating in a current of live steam. The reaction is usually accelerated\r\nby the presence of a few per cent. of free fatty acids as a starter.\r\nRecently the Twitchell double reagent has been introduced through which\r\nit is claimed that better colored fatty acids are obtained and the\r\nglycerine is free from ash.\r\n\r\nThe advantages claimed for the Twitchell process as outlined by\r\nJoslin[12] are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. All the glycerine is separated from the stock before entering the\r\nkettle, preventing loss of glycerine in the soap and removing glycerine\r\nfrom spent lye.\r\n\r\n2. The liquors contain 15-20 per cent. glycerine whereas spent lyes\r\ncontain but 3-5 per cent. necessitating less evaporation and\r\nconsequently being more economical in steam, labor and time.\r\n\r\n3. No salt is obtained in the liquors which makes the evaporation\r\ncheaper and removes the cause of corrosion of the evaporator; also\r\nsaves the glycerine retained by the salt.\r\n\r\n4. The glycerine liquors are purer and thus the treatment of the lyes is\r\ncheaper and simpler and the evaporation less difficult.\r\n\r\n5. The glycerine can readily be evaporated to 90 per cent. crude rather\r\nthan 80 per cent. crude, thus saving drums, labor in handling and\r\nfreight. The glycerine furthermore receives a higher rating and price,\r\nbeing known as saponification crude which develops no glycols in\r\nrefining it.\r\n\r\n6. The fatty acids obtained by the Twitchell saponifier may be converted\r\ninto soap by carbonates, thus saving cost in alkali.\r\n\r\n7. There is a decrease in the odor of many strong smelling stocks.\r\n\r\n8. The glycerine may be obtained from half boiled and cold made soaps as\r\nwell as soft (potash) soaps.\r\n\r\nWhile the advantages thus outlined are of decided value in the\r\nemployment of the Twitchell process, the one great disadvantage is that\r\nthe fatty acids obtained are rather dark in color and are not\r\nsatisfactorily employed for the making of a soap where whiteness of\r\ncolor is desired.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the process the previously heated oil or fat to be\r\nsaponified is run into a lead lined tank. As greases and tallow often\r\ncontain impurities a preliminary treatment with sulfuric acid is\r\nnecessary. For a grease 1.25 per cent. of half water and half 66deg. B.\r\nsulfuric acid is the approximate amount. The undiluted 66deg. B. acid\r\nshould never be added directly, as the grease would be charred by this.\r\nThe grease should be agitated by steam after the required percentage of\r\nacid, calculated on the weight of the grease, has been added. The wash\r\nlye coming off should be 7deg.-10deg. B. on a good clean grease or\r\n15deg.-22deg. B. on cotton oil or a poor grease. As has been stated the\r\ngrease is heated before the acid is added or the condensation of the\r\nsteam necessitates the addition of more acid. After having boiled for\r\n1-2 hours the grease is allowed to settle for 12 hours and run off\r\nthrough a swivel pipe.\r\n\r\nAfter the grease has been washed, as just explained, and settled, it is\r\npumped into a covered wooden tank containing an open brass coil. Some of\r\nthe second lye from a previous run is usually left in this tank and the\r\ngrease pumped into this. The amount of this lye should be about\r\none-third to one-half the weight of the grease so that there is about 60\r\nper cent. by weight of grease in the tank after 24 hours boiling. Where\r\noccasions arise when there is no second lye about 50 per cent. by weight\r\nof distilled water to the amount of grease is run into the tank to\r\nreplace the lye. The saponifier is then added through a glass or granite\r\nware funnel after the contents of the tank have been brought to a boil.\r\nIf the boiling is to be continued 48 hours, 1 per cent. of saponifier is\r\nadded. For 24 hours boiling add 1.5 per cent. The boiling is continued\r\nfor 24-48 hours allowing 18 inches for boiling room or the grease will\r\nboil over.\r\n\r\nAfter boiling has continued the required length of time the mass is\r\nsettled and the glycerine water is drawn off to the treatment tank.\r\nShould a permanent emulsion have formed, due to adding too great an\r\namount of saponifier, a little sulfuric acid (0.1 per cent.-0.3 per\r\ncent.) will readily break this. During the time this is being done the\r\nspace between the grease and the cover on the tank is kept filled with\r\nsteam as contact with the air darkens the fatty acids.\r\n\r\nTo the grease remaining in the tank distilled water (condensed water\r\nfrom steam coils) to one-half its volume is added and the boiling\r\ncontinued 12-24 hours. The grease is then settled and the clear grease\r\nrun off through a swivel pipe. A layer of emulsion usually forms between\r\nthe clear grease and lye so that it may easily be determined when the\r\ngrease has all been run off. To prevent discoloration of the fatty acids\r\nit is necessary to neutralize the lye with barium carbonate. The amount\r\nof this to be added depends upon the percentage of saponifier used.\r\nAbout 1/10 the weight of saponifier is the right amount. The barium\r\ncarbonate is added through the funnel at the top of the tank mixed with\r\na little water and the lye tested until it is neutral to methyl orange\r\nindicator. When the fatty acids are thus treated they will not darken\r\nupon exposure to the air when run off.\r\n\r\nFresh grease is now pumped into the lye or water remaining in the tank\r\nand the process repeated.\r\n\r\nThe glycerine water or first lye is run to the treatment tank, the fat\r\nskimmed off and neutralized with lime until it shows pink with\r\nphenolphthalein, after having been thoroughly boiled with steam. About\r\n0.25 per cent. lime is the proper amount to add. The mixture is then\r\nallowed to settle and the supernatant mixture drawn off and run to the\r\nglycerine evaporator feed tank. The lime which holds considerable\r\nglycerine is filtered and the liquor added to the other. The evaporation\r\nis carried out in two stages. The glycerine water is first evaporated to\r\nabout 60 per cent. glycerol, then dropped into a settling tank to settle\r\nout the calcium sulfate. The clear liquor is then evaporated to crude\r\n(about 90 per cent. glycerine) and the sediment filtered and also\r\nevaporated to crude.\r\n\r\nAs to the amount of saponifier to use on various stocks, this is best\r\ndetermined by experiment as to how high a percentage gives dark colored\r\nfatty acids. For good stock such as clean tallow, prime cottonseed oil,\r\ncorn oil, cocoanut oil and stock of this kind 0.75 per cent. saponifier\r\nis sufficient. For poorer grades of tallow, house grease, poor\r\ncottonseed oil, etc., 1 per cent. saponifier is required and for poorer\r\ngrade greases higher percentages. The percentage of fatty acids\r\ndeveloped varies in various stocks, and also varies with the care that\r\nthe operation is carried out, but is usually between 85 per cent.-95 per\r\ncent. Due to the water taken up in the saponification process there is a\r\nyield of about 103 pounds of fatty acids and glycerine for 100 pounds of\r\nfat.\r\n\r\nThe Twitchell reagent has undoubtedly caused a decided advance in the\r\nsaponification of fats and oils and has been of great value to the soap\r\nmanufacturer, because with a small expenditure it is possible to compete\r\nwith the much more expensive equipment necessary for autoclave\r\nsaponification. The drawback, however, has been that the reagent\r\nimparted a dark color to the fatty acids obtained, due to decomposition\r\nproducts forming when the reagent is made, and hence is not suitable for\r\nuse in soaps where whiteness of color is desired.\r\n\r\nThere have recently been two new reagents introduced which act as\r\ncatalyzers in splitting fats, just as the Twitchell reagent acts, but\r\nthe fatty acids produced by the cleavage are of good color. The\r\nsaponification, furthermore, takes place more rapidly. These are the\r\nPfeilring reagent and Kontact reagent.\r\n\r\nThe Pfeilring reagent is very similar to the Twitchell reagent, being\r\nmade from hydrogenated castor oil and naphthalene by sulfonation with\r\nconcentrated sulfuric acid. It is manufactured in Germany and is being\r\nextensively used in that country with good success.\r\n\r\nThe Kontact or Petroff reagent, discovered by Petroff in Russia, is made\r\nfrom sulfonated mineral oils. Until very recently it has only been\r\nmanufactured in Europe, but now that it has been found possible to\r\nobtain the proper mineral constituent from American petroleum, it is\r\nbeing manufactured in this country, and it is very probable that it will\r\nreplace the Twitchell reagent because of the advantages derived by using\r\nit, as compared to the old Twitchell reagent.\r\n\r\nThe method and equipment necessary for employing either the Pfeilring or\r\nKontact reagents is exactly the same as in using the Twitchell process.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOCLAVE SAPONIFICATION.\r\n\r\nWhile the introduction of the Twitchell process to a great extent\r\nreplaced the autoclave method of saponification for obtaining fatty\r\nacids for soap making, the autoclave method is also used. This process\r\nconsists in heating the previously purified fat or oil in the presence\r\nof lime and water, or water only, for several hours, which causes a\r\nsplitting of the glycerides into fatty acids and glycerine. The\r\nadvantage of autoclave saponification over the Twitchell process is that\r\na greater cleavage of the fats and oils results in less time and at a\r\nslightly less expense. The glycerine thus obtained is also purer and of\r\nbetter color than that obtained by Twitchelling the fats.\r\n\r\nAn autoclave or digestor consists of a strongly constructed, closed\r\ncylindrical tank, usually made of copper, and is so built as to resist\r\ninternal pressure. The digestor is usually 3 to 5 feet in diameter and\r\nfrom 18 to 25 feet high. It may be set up horizontally or vertically and\r\nis covered with an asbestos jacket to retain the heat. Various inlets\r\nand outlets for the fats, steam, etc., as well as a pressure gauge and\r\nsafety valve are also a necessary part of the equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIME SAPONIFICATION.\r\n\r\nThe saponification in an autoclave is usually carried out by introducing\r\nthe fats into the autoclave with a percentage of lime, magnesia or zinc\r\noxide, together with water. If the fats contain any great amount of\r\nimpurities, it is first necessary to purify them either by a treatment\r\nwith weak sulfuric acid, as described under the Twitchell process, or by\r\nboiling them up with brine and settling out the impurities from the hot\r\nfat.\r\n\r\nTo charge the autoclave a partial vacuum is created therein by\r\ncondensation of steam just before running the purified oil in from an\r\nelevated tank. The required quantity of unslaked lime, 2 to 4 per cent.\r\nof the weight of the fat, is run in with the molten fat, together with\r\n30 per cent. to 50 per cent. of water. While 8.7 per cent. lime is\r\ntheoretically required, practice has shown that 2 per cent. to 4 per\r\ncent. is sufficient. The digestor, having been charged and adjusted,\r\nsteam is turned on and a pressure of 8 to 10 atmospheres maintained\r\nthereon for a period of six to ten hours. Samples of the fat are taken\r\nat various intervals and the percentage of free fatty acids determined.\r\nWhen the saponification is completed the contents of the autoclave are\r\nremoved, usually by blowing out the digestor into a wooden settling\r\ntank, or by first running off the glycerine water and then blowing out\r\nthe lime, soap and fatty acids. The mass discharged from the digestor\r\nseparates into two layers, the upper consisting of a mixture of lime\r\nsoap or \"rock\" and fatty acids, and the lower layer contains the\r\nglycerine or \"sweet\" water. The glycerine water is first run off through\r\na clearing tank or oil separator, if this has not been done directly\r\nfrom the autoclave, and the mass remaining washed once or twice more\r\nwith water to remove any glycerine still retained by the lime soap. The\r\ncalculated amount of sulfuric acid to decompose the lime \"rock\" is then\r\nadded, and the mass agitated until the fatty acids contained therein are\r\nentirely set free. Another small wash is then given and the wash water\r\nadded to the glycerine water already run off. The glycerine water is\r\nneutralized with lime, filtered and concentrated as in the Twitchell\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nDue to the difficulties of working the autoclave saponification with\r\nlime, decomposing the large amount of lime soap obtained and dealing\r\nwith much gypsum formed thereby which collects as a sediment and\r\nnecessitates cleaning the tanks, other substances are used to replace\r\nlime. Magnesia, about 2 per cent. of the weight of the fat, is used and\r\ngives better results than lime. One-half to 1 per cent. of zinc oxide of\r\nthe weight of the fat is even better adapted and is now being\r\nextensively employed for this purpose. In using zinc oxide it is\r\npossible to recover the zinc salts and use them over again in the\r\ndigestor, which makes the process as cheap to work as with lime, with\r\nfar more satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n\r\nACID SAPONIFICATION.\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to saponify fats and oils in an autoclave with the\r\naddition of acid to the fat, unless a specially-constructed digestor is\r\nbuilt, the action of the acid on the metal from which the autoclave is\r\nconstructed prohibits its use. The acid saponification is therefore\r\ncarried out by another method.\r\n\r\nThe method of procedure for acid saponification, therefore, is to first\r\npurify the fats with dilute acid as already described. The purified, hot\r\nor warm, dry fat is then run to a specially-built acidifier or a\r\nlead-lined tank and from 4 per cent. to 6 per cent. of concentrated\r\nsulfuric acid added to the fat, depending upon its character, the degree\r\nof saponification required, temperature and time of saponification. A\r\ntemperature of 110 degrees C. is maintained and the mass mixed from four\r\nto six hours. The tank is then allowed to settle out the tar formed\r\nduring the saponification, and the fatty acids run off to another tank\r\nand boiled up about three times with one-third the amount of water. The\r\nwater thus obtained contains the glycerine, and after neutralization is\r\nconcentrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nAQUEOUS SAPONIFICATION.\r\n\r\nWhile lime or a similar substance is ordinarily used to aid in splitting\r\nfats in an autoclave, the old water process is still used. This is a\r\nconvenient, though slower and more dangerous method, of producing the\r\nhydrolysis of the glyceride, as well as the simplest in that fatty acids\r\nand glycerine in a water solution are obtained. The method consists in\r\nmerely charging the autoclave with fats and adding about 30 per cent. to\r\n40 per cent. of their weight of water, depending on the amount of free\r\nfatty acid and subjecting the charge to a pressure of 150 to 300 pounds,\r\nuntil the splitting has taken place. This is a much higher pressure than\r\nwhen lime is used and therefore a very strong autoclave is required.\r\nSince fatty acids and pure glycerine water are obtained no subsequent\r\ntreatment of the finished charge is necessary except separating the\r\nglycerine water and giving the fatty acids a wash with water to remove\r\nall the glycerine from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPLITTING FATS WITH FERMENTS.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the causes of rancidity of oils and fats it was pointed\r\nout that the initial splitting of these is due to enzymes, organized\r\nferments. In the seeds of the castor oil plant, especially in the\r\nprotoplasm of the seed, the enzyme which has the property of causing\r\nhydrolysis of the glycerides is found. The ferment from the seeds of the\r\ncastor oil plant is now extracted and used upon a commercial basis for\r\nsplitting fats.\r\n\r\nThe equipment necessary to carry out this method of saponification is a\r\nround, iron, lead-lined tank with a conical bottom, preferably about\r\ntwice as long as it is wide. Open and closed steam coils are also\r\nnecessary in the tank.\r\n\r\nThe oils are first heated and run into this tank. The right temperature\r\nto heat these to is about 1 degree to 2 degrees above their\r\nsolidification point. For liquid oils 23 degrees C. is the proper heat\r\nas under 20 degrees C. the cleavage takes place slowly. Fats titering 44\r\ndegrees C. or above must be brought down in titer by mixing with them\r\noils of a lower titer as the ferment or enzyme is killed at about 45\r\ndegrees C. and thus loses its power of splitting. It is also necessary\r\nto have the fat in the liquid state or the ferment does not act. The\r\nproper temperature must be maintained with dry steam.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, necessary to add water, which may be any kind desired,\r\ncondensed, water from steam coils, well, city, etc. From 30 per cent. to\r\n40 per cent., on the average 35 per cent. of water is added, as the\r\namount necessary is regulated so as to not dilute the glycerine water\r\nunnecessarily. To increase the hydrolysis a catalyzer, some neutral\r\nsalt, usually manganese sulfate is added in the proportion of 0.15 per\r\ncent. appears to vary directly as the saponification number of the fat\r\nor oil. The approximate percentages of fermentive substance to be added\r\nto various oils and fats follow:\r\n\r\n    Cocoanut oil          8   %\r\n    Palm Kernel oil       8   %\r\n    Cottonseed oil        6-7 %\r\n    Linseed oil           4-5 %\r\n    Tallow oil            8-10%\r\n\r\nThe oil, water, manganese sulfate and ferment having been placed in the\r\ntank in the order named, the mixture is agitated with air for about a\r\nquarter of an hour to form an even emulsion, in which state the mass is\r\nkept by stirring occasionally with air while the saponification is\r\ntaking place. A temperature is maintained a degree or two above the\r\ntiter point of the fat with closed steam which may be aided by covering\r\nthe tank for a period of 24 to 48 hours. The splitting takes place\r\nrapidly at first, then proceeds more slowly. In 24 hours 80 per cent. of\r\nthe fats are split and in 48 hours 85 per cent. to 90 per cent.\r\n\r\nWhen the cleavage has reached the desired point the mass is heated to 80\r\ndegrees-85 degrees C. with live or indirect steam while stirring with\r\nair. Then 0.1 per cent.-0.15 per cent of concentrated sulfuric acid\r\ndiluted with water is added to break the emulsion. When the emulsion is\r\nbroken the glycerine water is allowed to settle out and drawn off. The\r\nglycerine water contains 12 per cent. to 25 per cent. glycerine and\r\ncontains manganese sulfate, sulfuric acid and albuminous matter. Through\r\nneutralization with lime at boiling temperature and filtration the\r\nimpurities can almost all be removed after which the glycerine water may\r\nbe fed to the evaporator. Should it be desired to overcome the trouble\r\ndue to the gypsum formed in the glycerine, the lime treatment may be\r\ncombined with a previous treatment of the glycerine water with barium\r\nhydrate to remove the sulfuric acid, then later oxalic acid to\r\nprecipitate the lime.\r\n\r\nThe fatty acids obtained by splitting with ferments are of very good\r\ncolor and adaptable for soap making.\r\n\r\n\r\nKREBITZ PROCESS.\r\n\r\nThe Krebitz process which has been used to some extent in Europe is\r\nbased upon the conversion of the fat or oil into lime soap which is\r\ntransformed into the soda soap by the addition of sodium carbonate. To\r\ncarry out the process a convenient batch of, say, 10,000 pounds of fat\r\nor oil, is run into a shallow kettle containing 1,200 to 1,400 pounds of\r\nlime previously slaked with 3,700 to 4,500 pounds of water. The mass is\r\nslowly heated with live steam to almost boiling until an emulsion is\r\nobtained. The tank is then covered and allowed to stand about 12 hours.\r\nThe lime soap thus formed is dropped from the tank into the hopper of a\r\nmill, finely ground and conveyed to a leeching tank. The glycerine is\r\nwashed out and the glycerine water run to a tank for evaporation. The\r\nsoap is then further washed and these washings are run to other tanks to\r\nbe used over again to wash a fresh batch of soap. About 150,000 pounds\r\nof water will wash the soap made from 10,000 pounds of fat which makes\r\nbetween 15,000 and 16,000 pounds of soap. The first wash contains\r\napproximately 10 per cent. glycerine and under ordinary circumstances\r\nthis only need be evaporated for glycerine recovery.\r\n\r\nAfter extracting the glycerine the soap is slowly introduced into a\r\nboiling solution of sodium carbonate or soda ash and boiled until the\r\nsoda has replaced the lime. This is indicated by the disappearance of\r\nthe small lumps of lime soap. Caustic soda is then added to saponify the\r\nfat not converted by the lime saponification. The soap is then salted\r\nout and allowed to settle out the calcium carbonate. This drops to the\r\nbottom of the kettle as a heavy sludge entangling about 10 per cent. of\r\nthe soap. A portion of this soap may be recovered by agitating the\r\nsludge with heat and water, pumping the soap off the top and filtering\r\nthe remaining sludge.\r\n\r\nWhile the soap thus obtained is very good, the percentage of glycerine\r\nrecovered is greatly increased and the cost of alkali as carbonate is\r\nless. The disadvantages are many. Large quantities of lime are required;\r\nit is difficult to recover the soap from the lime sludge; the operations\r\nare numerous prior to the soap making proper and rather complicated\r\napparatus is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTILLATION OF FATTY ACIDS.\r\n\r\nThe fatty acids obtained by various methods of saponification may be\r\nfurther improved by distillation.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out this distillation, two methods may be pursued,\r\nfirst, the continuous method, whereby the fatty acids are continually\r\ndistilled for five to six days, and, second, the two phase method,\r\nwhereby the distillation continues for 16 to 20 hours, after which the\r\nresidue is drawn off, treated with acid, and its distillate added to a\r\nfresh charge of fatty acids. The latter method is by far the best, since\r\nthe advantages derived by thus proceeding more than compensate the\r\nnecessity of cleaning the still. Better colored fatty acids are\r\nobtained; less unsaponifiable matter is contained therein; there is no\r\naccumulation of impurities; the amount of neutral fat is lessened\r\nbecause the treatment of the tar with acid causes a cleavage of the\r\nneutral fat and the candle tar or pitch obtained is harder and better\r\nand thus more valuable.\r\n\r\nThe stills are usually built of copper, which are heated by both direct\r\nfire and superheated steam. Distillation under vacuum is advisable. To\r\nbegin the distilling operation, the still is first filled with dry hot\r\nfatty acids to the proper level. Superheated steam is then admitted and\r\nthe condenser is first heated to prevent the freezing of the fatty\r\nacids, passing over into same. When the temperature reaches 230 deg. C.\r\nthe distillation begins. At the beginning, the fatty acids flow from the\r\ncondenser, an intense green color, due to the formation of copper soaps\r\nproduced by the action of the fatty acids on the copper still. This\r\ncolor may easily be removed by treating with dilute acid to decompose\r\nthe copper soaps.\r\n\r\nIn vacuum distillation, the operation is begun without the use of\r\nvacuum. Vacuum is introduced only when the distillation has proceeded\r\nfor a time and the introduction of this must be carefully regulated,\r\nelse the rapid influence of vacuum will cause the contents of the still\r\nto overflow. When distillation has begun a constant level of fatty acids\r\nis retained therein by opening the feeding valve to same, and the heat\r\nis so regulated as to produce the desired rate of distillation. As soon\r\nas the distillate flows darker and slower, the feeding valve to the\r\nstill is shut off and the distillation continued until most of the\r\ncontents of the still are distilled off, which is indicated by a rise in\r\nthe temperature. Distillation is then discontinued, the still shut down,\r\nand in about an hour the contents are sufficiently cool to be emptied.\r\nThe residue is run off into a proper receiving vessel, treated with\r\ndilute acid and used in the distillation of tar.\r\n\r\nIn the distillation of tar the same method as the above is followed,\r\nonly distillation proceeds at a higher temperature. The first portion\r\nand last portion of the distillate from tar are so dark that it is\r\nnecessary to add them to a fresh charge of fatty acids. By a well\r\nconducted distillation of tar about 50 per cent. of the fatty acids from\r\nthe tar can be used to mix with the distilled fatty acids. The residue\r\nof this operation called stearine pitch or candle tar consists of a\r\nhard, brittle, dark substance. Elastic pitch only results where\r\ndistillation has been kept constant for several days without\r\ninterrupting the process, and re-distilling the tar. In a good\r\ndistillation the distillation loss is 0.5 to 1.5% and loss in pitch\r\n1.5%. Fatty acids which are not acidified deliver about 3% of pitch.\r\nVery impure fats yield even a higher percentage in spite of acidifying.\r\nFor a long time it was found impossible to find any use for stearine\r\npitch, but in recent years a use has been found for same in the\r\nelectrical installation of cables.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] Journ. Ind. Eng. Chem. (1909), I, p. 654.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAnalytical Methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to attain a certain amount of efficiency in\r\ndetermining the worth of the raw material entering into the manufacture\r\nof soap through organoleptic methods, these are by no means accurate. It\r\nis, therefore, necessary to revert to chemical methods to correctly\r\ndetermine the selection of fats, oil or other substances used in soap\r\nmaking, as well as standardizing a particular soap manufactured and to\r\nproperly regulate the glycerine recovered.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose to cover in detail the numerous analytical\r\nprocesses which may be employed in the examination of fats and oils,\r\nalkalis, soap and glycerine, as these are fully and accurately covered\r\nin various texts, but rather to give briefly the necessary tests which\r\nought to be carried out in factories where large amounts of soap are\r\nmade. Occasion often arises where it is impossible to employ a chemist,\r\nyet it is possible to have this work done by a competent person or to\r\nhave someone instruct himself as just how to carry out the more simple\r\nanalyses, which is not a very difficult matter. The various standard\r\nsolutions necessary to carrying out the simpler titrations can readily\r\nbe purchased from dealers in chemical apparatus and it does not take\r\nextraordinary intelligence for anyone to operate a burette, yet in many\r\nsoap plants in this country absolutely no attention is paid to the\r\nexamining of raw material, though many thousand pounds are handled\r\nannually, which, if they were more carefully examined would result in\r\nthe saving of much more money than it costs to examine them or have\r\nthem at least occasionally analyzed.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF FATS AND OILS.\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive at proper results in the analysis of a fat or oil, it\r\nis necessary to have a proper sample. To obtain this a sample of several\r\nof the packages of oil or fat is taken and these mixed or molten\r\ntogether into a composite sample which is used in making the tests. If\r\nthe oil or fat is solid, a tester is used in taking the sample from the\r\npackage and if they are liquid, it is a simple matter to draw off a\r\nuniform sample from each package and from these to form a composite\r\nsample.\r\n\r\nIn purchasing an oil or fat for soap making, the manufacturer is usually\r\ninterested in the amount of free fatty acid contained therein, of\r\nmoisture, the titer, the percentage of unsaponifiable matter and to\r\npreviously determine the color of soap which will be obtained where\r\ncolor is an object.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF FREE FATTY ACIDS.\r\n\r\nSince the free fatty acid content of a fat or oil represents a loss of\r\nglycerine, the greater the percentage of free fatty acid, the less\r\nglycerine is contained in the fat or oil, it is advisable to purchase a\r\nfat or oil with the lower free acid, other properties and the price\r\nbeing the same.\r\n\r\nWhile the mean molecular weight of the mixed free fatty acids varies\r\nwith the same and different oils or fats and should be determined for\r\nany particular analysis for accuracy, the free fatty acid is usually\r\nexpressed as oleic acid, which has a molecular weight of 282.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the analysis 5 to 20 grams of the fat are weighed out into\r\nan Erlenmeyer flask and 50 cubic centimeters of carefully neutralized\r\nalcohol are added. In order to neutralize the alcohol add a few drops of\r\nphenolphthalein solution to same and add a weak caustic soda solution\r\ndrop by drop until a very faint pink color is obtained upon shaking or\r\nstirring the alcohol thoroughly. The mixture of fat and neutralized\r\nalcohol is then heated to boiling and titrated with tenth normal alkali\r\nsolution, using phenolphthalein as an indicator. As only the free fatty\r\nacids are readily soluble in the alcohol and the fat itself only\r\nslightly mixes with it, the flask should be well agitated toward the end\r\nof the titration. When a faint pink color remains after thoroughly\r\nagitating the flask the end point is reached. In order to calculate the\r\npercentage of free fatty acid as oleic acid, multiply the number of\r\ncubic centimeters of tenth normal alkali used as read on the burette by\r\n0.0282 and divide by the number of grams of fat taken for the\r\ndetermination and multiply by 100.\r\n\r\nWhen dark colored oils or fats are being titrated it is often difficult\r\nto obtain a good end point with phenolphthalein. In such cases about 2\r\ncubic centimeters of a 2 per cent. alcoholic solution of Alkali Blue 6 B\r\nis recommended.\r\n\r\nAnother method of directly determining the free fatty acid content of\r\ntallow or grease upon which this determination is most often made is to\r\nweigh out into an Erlenmeyer flask exactly 5.645 grams of a sample of\r\ntallow or grease. Add about 75 cubic centimeters of neutralized alcohol.\r\nHeat until it boils, then titrate with tenth normal alkali and divide\r\nthe reading by 2, which gives the percentage of free fatty acid as\r\noleic. If a fifth normal caustic solution is used, the reading on the\r\nburette gives the percentage of free fatty acid directly. This method,\r\nwhile it eliminates the necessity of calculation, is troublesome in that\r\nit is difficult to obtain the exact weight of fat.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOISTURE.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the amount of moisture contained in a fat or oil 5 to 10\r\ngrams are weighed into a flat bottom dish, together with a known amount\r\nof clean, dry sand, if it is so desired. The dish is then heated over a\r\nwater bath, or at a temperature of 100-110 degs. C., until it no longer\r\nloses weight upon drying and reweighing the dish. One hour should elapse\r\nbetween the time the dish is put on the water bath and the time it is\r\ntaken off to reweigh. The difference between the weight of the dish is\r\nput on the water bath and the time it is taken off when it reaches a\r\nconstant weight is moisture. This difference divided by the original\r\nweight of the fat or oil x 100 gives the percentage of moisture.\r\n\r\nWhen highly unsaturated fats or oils are being analyzed for moisture, an\r\nerror may be introduced either by the absorption of oxygen, which is\r\naccelerated at higher temperature, or by the formation of volatile fatty\r\nacids. The former causes an increase in weight, the latter causes a\r\ndecrease. To obviate this, the above operation of drying should be\r\ncarried out in the presence of some inert gas like hydrogen, carbon\r\ndioxide, or nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTITER.\r\n\r\nThe titer of a fat or oil is really an indication of the amount of\r\nstearic acid contained therein. The titer, expressed in degrees\r\nCentigrade, is the solidification point of the fatty acids of an oil or\r\nfat. In order to carry out the operation a Centigrade thermometer\r\ngraduated in one or two-tenths of a degree is necessary. A thermometer\r\ngraduated between 10 degs. centigrade to 60 degs. centigrade is best\r\nadapted and the graduations should be clear cut and distinct.\r\n\r\nTo make the determination about 30 grams of fat are roughly weighed in a\r\nmetal dish and 30-40 cubic centimeters of a 30 per cent. (36 degs.\r\nBaume) solution of sodium hydroxide, together with 30-40 cubic\r\ncentimeters of alcohol, denatured alcohol will do, are added and the\r\nmass heated until saponified. Heat over a low flame or over an asbestos\r\nplate until the soap thus formed is dry, constantly stirring the\r\ncontents of the dish to prevent burning. The dried soap is then\r\ndissolved in about 1000 cubic centimeters of water, being certain that\r\nall the alcohol has been expelled by boiling the soap solution for about\r\nhalf an hour. When the soap is in solution add sufficient sulphuric acid\r\nto decompose the soap, approximately 100 cubic centimeters of 25 degs.\r\nBaume sulphuric acid, and boil until the fatty acids form a clear layer\r\non top of the liquid. A few pieces of pumice stone put into the mixture\r\nwill prevent the bumping caused by boiling. Siphon off the water from\r\nthe bottom of the dish and wash the fatty acids with boiling water until\r\nfree from sulphuric acid. Collect the fatty acids in a small casserole\r\nor beaker and dry them over a steam bath or drying oven at 110 degs.\r\nCentigrade. When the fatty acids are dry, cool them to about 10 degs.\r\nabove the titer expected and transfer them to a titer tube or short test\r\ntube which is firmly supported by a cork in the opening of a salt mouth\r\nbottle. Hang the thermometer by a cord from above the supported tube so\r\nit reaches close to the bottom when in the titer tube containing the\r\nfatty acids and so that it may be used as a stirrer. Stir the mass\r\nrather slowly, closely noting the temperature. The temperature will\r\ngradually fall during the stirring operation and finally remain\r\nstationary for half a minute or so then rise from 0.1 to 0.5 degs. The\r\nhighest point to which the mercury rises after having been stationary is\r\ntaken as the reading of the titer.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF UNSAPONIFIABLE MATTER.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the unsaponifiable matter in fats and oils they\r\nare first saponified, then the unsaponifiable, which consists mainly of\r\nhydrocarbons and the higher alcohols cholesterol or phytosterol, is\r\nextracted with ether or petroleum ether, the ether evaporated and the\r\nresidue weighed as unsaponifiable.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the process first saponify about 5 grams of fat or oil with\r\nan excess of alcoholic potassium hydrate, 20-30 cubic centimeters of a 1\r\nto 10 solution of potassium hydroxide in alcohol until the alcohol is\r\nevaporated over a steam bath. Wash the soap thus formed into a\r\nseparatory funnel of 200 cubic centimeters capacity with 80-100 cubic\r\ncentimeters water. Then add about 60 cubic centimeters of ether,\r\npetroleum ether or 86 degs. gasoline and thoroughly shake the funnel to\r\nextract the unsaponifiable. Should the two layers not separate readily,\r\nadd a few cubic centimeters of alcohol, which will readily cause them to\r\nseparate. Draw off the watery solution from beneath and wash the ether\r\nwith water containing a few drops of sodium hydrate and run to another\r\ndish. Pour the watery solution into the funnel again and repeat the\r\nextraction once or twice more or until the ether shows no discoloration.\r\nCombine the ether extractions into the funnel and wash with water until\r\nno alkaline reaction is obtained from the wash water. Run the ether\r\nextract to a weighed dish, evaporate and dry rapidly in a drying oven.\r\nAs some of the hydrocarbons are readily volatile at 100 degs.\r\nCentigrade, the drying should not be carried on any longer than\r\nnecessary. The residue is then weighed and the original weight of fat\r\ntaken divided into the weight of the residue x 100 gives the percentage\r\nunsaponifiable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEST FOR COLOR OF SOAP.\r\n\r\nIt is often desirable to determine the color of the finished soap by a\r\nrapid determination before it is made into soap. It often happens,\r\nespecially with the tallows, that a dark colored sample produces a light\r\ncolored soap, whereas a bleached light colored tallow produces a soap\r\noff shade.\r\n\r\nTo rapidly determine whether the color easily washes out of the tallow\r\nwith lye, 100 cubic centimeters of tallow are saponified in an enameled\r\nor iron dish with 100 cubic centimeters of 21 degs. Baume soda lye and\r\n100 cubic centimeters of denatured alcohol. Continue heating over a wire\r\ngauze until all the alcohol is expelled and then add 50 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the 21 degs. Baume lye to grain the soap. Allow the lyes\r\nto settle and with an inverted pipette draw off the lyes into a test\r\ntube or bottle. Close the soap with 100 cubic centimeters of hot water\r\nand when closed again grain with 50 cubic centimeters of the lye by just\r\nbringing to a boil over an open flame. Again allow the lyes to settle\r\nand put aside a sample of the lye for comparison. Repeat the process of\r\nclosing, graining and settling and take a sample of lye. If the lye is\r\nstill discolored repeat the above operations again or until the lye is\r\ncolorless. Ordinarily all the color will come out with the third lye.\r\nThe soap thus obtained contains considerable water which makes it appear\r\nwhite. The soap is, therefore, dried to about 15 per cent. moisture and\r\nexamined for color. The color thus obtained is a very good criterion as\r\nto what may be expected in the soap kettle.\r\n\r\nBy making the above analyses of fats or oils the main properties as to\r\ntheir adaptability for being made into soap are determined. In some\r\ncases, especially where adulteration or mixtures of oils are suspected,\r\nit is necessary to further analyze same. The methods of carrying out\r\nthese analyses are fully covered by various texts on fats and oils and\r\nwe will not go into details regarding the method of procedure in\r\ncarrying these out.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTING OF ALKALIS USED IN SOAP MAKING.\r\n\r\nThe alkalis entering into the manufacture of soap such as caustic soda\r\nor sodium hydroxide, caustic potash or potassium hydrate, carbonate of\r\nsoda or sodium carbonate, carbonate of potash or potassium carbonate\r\nusually contain impurities which do not enter into combination with the\r\nfats or fatty acids to form soap. It is out of the question to use\r\nchemically pure alkalis in soap making, hence it is often necessary to\r\ndetermine the alkalinity of an alkali. It may again be pointed out that\r\nin saponifying a neutral fat or oil only caustic soda or potash are\r\nefficient and the carbonate contained in these only combines to a more\r\nor less extent with any free fatty acids contained in the oils or fats.\r\nCaustic soda or potash or lyes made from these alkalis upon exposure to\r\nthe air are gradually converted into sodium or potassium carbonate by\r\nthe action of the carbon dioxide contained in the air. While the amount\r\nof carbonate thus formed is not very great and is greatest upon the\r\nsurface, all lyes as well as caustic alkalis contain some carbonate.\r\nThis carbonate introduces an error in the analysis of caustic alkalis\r\nwhen accuracy is required and thus in the analysis of caustic soda or\r\npotash it is necessary to remove the carbonate when the true alkalinity\r\nas sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide is desired. This may be done\r\nby titration in alcohol which has been neutralized.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the alkalinity of any of the above mentioned\r\nalkalis, it is first necessary to obtain a representative sample of the\r\nsubstance to be analyzed. To do this take small samples from various\r\nportions of the package and combine them into a composite sample.\r\nCaustic potash and soda are hygroscopic and samples should be weighed at\r\nonce or kept in a well stoppered bottle. Sodium or potassium carbonate\r\ncan be weighed more easily as they do not rapidly absorb moisture from\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nTo weigh the caustic soda or potash place about five grams on a watch\r\nglass on a balance and weigh as rapidly as possible. Wash into a 500\r\ncubic centimeter volumetric flask and bring to the mark with distilled\r\nwater. Pipette off 50 cubic centimeters into a 200 cubic centimeter\r\nbeaker, dilute slightly with distilled water, add a few drops of methyl\r\norange indicator and titrate with normal acid. For the carbonates about\r\n1 gram may be weighed, washed into a 400 cubic centimeter beaker,\r\ndiluted with distilled water, methyl orange indicator added and titrated\r\nwith normal acid. It is advisable to use methyl orange indicator in\r\nthese titrations as phenolphthalein is affected by the carbon dioxide\r\ngenerated when an acid reacts with a carbonate and does not give the\r\nproper end point, unless the solution is boiled to expel the carbon\r\ndioxide. Litmus may also be used as the indicator, but here again it is\r\nnecessary to boil as carbon dioxide also affects this substance. As an\r\naid to the action of these common indicators the following table may be\r\nhelpful:\r\n\r\n                    _Color in     _Color in\r\n  _Indicator._         Acid        Alkaline       _Action of\r\n                    Solution._     Solution._        CO_{2}._\r\n\r\nMethyl orange       Red             Yellow       Very slightly acid\r\nPhenolphthalein     Colorless       Red          Acid\r\nLitmus              Red             Blue         Acid\r\n\r\nIt may be further stated that methyl orange at the neutral point is\r\norange in color.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the percentage of effective alkali from the above\r\ntitrations, it must be first pointed out that in the case of caustic\r\npotash or soda aliquot portions are taken. This is done to reduce the\r\nerror necessarily involved by weighing, as the absorption of water is\r\ndecided. Thus we had, say, exactly 5 grams which weighed 5.05 grams by\r\nthe time it was balanced. This was dissolved in 500 cubic centimeters of\r\nwater and 50 cubic centimeters or one tenth of the amount of the\r\nsolution was taken, or in each 50 cubic centimeters there were 0.505\r\ngrams of the sample. We thus reduced the error of weighing by one tenth\r\nprovided other conditions introduce no error. In the case of the\r\ncarbonates the weight is taken directly.\r\n\r\nOne cubic centimeter of a normal acid solution is the equivalent of:\r\n\r\n                                           Grams.\r\n    Sodium Carbonate, Na_{2}CO_{3}        0.05305\r\n    Sodium Hydroxide, NaOH                0.04006\r\n    Sodium Oxide, Na_{2}O                 0.02905\r\n    Carbonate K_{2}CO_{3}                 0.06908\r\n    Potassium Hydroxide, KOH              0.05616\r\n    Potassium Oxide, K_{2}O               0.04715\r\n\r\nHence to arrive at the alkalinity we multiply the number of cubic\r\ncentimeters, read on the burette, by the factor opposite the terms in\r\nwhich we desire to express the alkalinity, divide the weight in grams\r\nthus obtained by the original weight taken, and multiply the result by\r\n100, which gives the percentage of alkali in the proper terms. For\r\nexample, say, we took the 0.505 grams of caustic potash as explained\r\nabove and required 8.7 cubic centimeter normal acid to neutralize the\r\nsolution, then\r\n\r\n    8.7 x .05616 = .4886 grams KOH in sample\r\n\r\n    .4886\r\n    ----- x 100 = 96.73% KOH in sample.\r\n    .505\r\n\r\nCaustic potash often contains some caustic soda, and while it is\r\npossible to express the results in terms of KOH, regardless of any\r\ntrouble that may be caused by this mixture in soap making, an error is\r\nintroduced in the results, not all the alkali being caustic potash. In\r\nsuch cases it is advisable to consult a book on analysis as the analysis\r\nis far more complicated than those given we will not consider it. The\r\npresence of carbonates, as already stated, also causes an error. To\r\novercome this the alkali is titrated in absolute alcohol, filtering off\r\nthe insoluble carbonate. The soluble portion is caustic hydrate and may\r\nbe titrated as such. The carbonate remaining on the filter paper is\r\ndissolved in water and titrated as carbonate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOAP ANALYSIS.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a sample of a cake of soap for analysis is a rather difficult\r\nmatter as the moisture content of the outer and inner layer varies\r\nconsiderably. To overcome this difficulty a borer or sampler may be run\r\nright through the cake of soap, or slices may be cut from various parts\r\nof the cake, or the cake may be cut and run through a meat chopper\r\nseveral times and mixed. A sufficient amount of a homogeneous sample\r\nobtained by any of these methods is preserved for the entire analysis by\r\nkeeping the soap in a securely stoppered bottle.\r\n\r\nThe more important determinations of soap are moisture, free alkali, or\r\nfatty acid, combined alkali and total fatty matter. Besides these it is\r\noften necessary to determine insoluble matter, glycerine, unsaponifiable\r\nmatter, rosin and sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOISTURE.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of soap for moisture, at its best, is most unsatisfactory,\r\nfor by heating it is impossible to drive off all the water, and on the\r\nother hand volatile oils driven off by heat are a part of the loss\r\nrepresented as moisture.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of determining moisture is to weigh 2 to 3 grams of\r\nfinely shaved soap on a watch glass and heat in an oven at 105 degrees\r\nC. for 2 to 3 hours. The loss in weight is represented as water,\r\nalthough it is really impossible to drive off all the water in this way.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the difficulties just mentioned either the Smith or Fahrion\r\nmethod may be used. Allen recommends Smith's method which is said to be\r\ntruthful to within 0.25 per cent. Fahrion's method, according to the\r\nauthor, gives reliable results to within 0.5 per cent. Both are more\r\nrapid than the above manipulation. To carry out the method of Smith, 5\r\nto 10 grams of finely ground soap are heated over a sand bath with a\r\nsmall Bunsen flame beneath it, in a large porcelain crucible. The\r\nheating takes 20 to 30 minutes, or until no further evidence is present\r\nof water being driven off. This may be tested by the fogging of a cold\r\npiece of glass held over the crucible immediately upon removing the\r\nburner. When no fog appears the soap is considered dry. Any lumps of\r\nsoap may be broken up by a small glass rod, weighed with the crucible,\r\nand with a roughened end to more easily separate the lumps. Should the\r\nsoap burn, this can readily be detected by the odor, which, of course,\r\nrenders the analysis useless. The loss in weight is moisture.\r\n\r\nBy Fahrion's method[13], 2 to 4 grams of soap are weighed in a platinum\r\ncrucible and about three times its weight of oleic acid, which has been\r\nheated at 120 degrees C. until all the water is driven off and preserved\r\nfrom moisture, is added and reweighed. The dish is then cautiously\r\nheated with a small flame until all the water is driven off and all the\r\nsoap is dissolved. Care must be exercised not to heat too highly or the\r\noleic acid will decompose. The moment the water is all driven off a\r\nclear solution is formed, provided no fillers are present in the soap.\r\nThe dish is then cooled in a dessicator and reweighed. The loss in\r\nweight of acid plus soap is moisture and is calculated on the weight of\r\nsoap taken. This determination takes about fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREE ALKALI OR ACID.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Alcoholic Method._\r\n\r\nTest a freshly cut surface of the soap with a few drops of an alcoholic\r\nphenolphthalein solution. If it does not turn red it may be assumed free\r\nfat is present; should a red color appear, free alkali is present. In\r\nany case dissolve 2 to 5 grams of soap in 100 cubic centimeters of\r\nneutralized alcohol and heat to boiling until in solution. Filter off\r\nthe undissolved portion containing carbonate, etc., and wash with\r\nalcohol. Add phenolphthalein to the filtrate and titrate with N/10 acid\r\nand calculate the per cent. of free alkali as sodium or potassium\r\nhydroxide. Should the filtrate be acid instead of alkaline, titrate with\r\nN/10 alkali and calculate the percentage of free fatty acid as oleic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nThe insoluble portion remaining on the filter paper is washed with water\r\nuntil all the carbonate is dissolved. The washings are then titrated\r\nwith N/10 sulfuric acid and expressed as sodium or potassium carbonate.\r\nShould borates or silicates be present it is possible to express in\r\nterms of these. If borax is present the carbon dioxide is boiled off\r\nafter neutralizing exactly to methyl orange; cool, add mannite and\r\nphenolphthalein and titrate the boric acid with standard alkali.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Bosshard and Huggenberg Method._[14]\r\n\r\nIn using the alcoholic method for the determination of the free alkali\r\nor fat in soap there is a possibility of both free fat and free alkali\r\nbeing present. Upon boiling in an alcoholic solution the fat will be\r\nsaponified, thus introducing an error in the analysis. The method of\r\nBosshard and Huggenberg overcomes this objection. Their method is\r\nbriefly as follows:\r\n\r\n_Reagents._\r\n\r\n1. N/10 hydrochloric acid to standardize N/10 alcoholic sodium\r\nhydroxide.\r\n\r\n2. Approximately N/10 alcoholic sodium hydroxide to fix and control the\r\nN/40 stearic acid.\r\n\r\n3. N/40 stearic acid. Preparation: About 7.1 grams of stearic acid are\r\ndissolved in one liter of absolute alcohol, the solution filtered, the\r\nstrength determined by titration against N/10 NaOH and then protected in\r\na well stoppered bottle, or better still connected directly to the\r\nburette.\r\n\r\n4. A 10 per cent. solution of barium chloride. Preparation: 100 grams of\r\nbarium chloride are dissolved in one liter of distilled water and\r\nfiltered. The neutrality of the solution should be proven as it must be\r\nneutral.\r\n\r\n5. [Greek: alpha] naptholphthalein indicator according to Sorenson.\r\nPreparation: 0.1 gram of [Greek: alpha] naphtholphthalein is dissolved in\r\n150 cubic centimeters of alcohol and 100 cubic centimeters of water.\r\nFor every 10 cubic centimeters of liquid use at least 12 drops of\r\nindicator.\r\n\r\n6. Phenolphthalein solution 1 gram to 100 cubic centimeter 96 per cent.\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n7. Solvent, 50 per cent. alcohol neutralized.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANIPULATION.\r\n\r\nFirst--Determine the strength of the N/10 alcoholic sodium hydroxide in\r\nterms of N/10 hydrochloric acid and calculate the factor, e. g.:\r\n\r\n    10 c.c. N/10 alcoholic NaOH = 9.95 N/10 HCl}\r\n    10 c.c. N/10 alcoholic NaOH = 9.96 N/10 HCl} 9.96\r\n\r\nThe alcoholic N/10 NaOH has a factor of 0.996.\r\n\r\nSecond--Control the N/40 stearic acid with the above alkali to obtain\r\nits factor, e. g.:\r\n\r\n    40 c.c. N/40 alcoholic stearic acid =\r\n                              10.18 c.c. N/10 NaOH }\r\n    40 c.c. N/40 alcoholic stearic acid =          } 10.2\r\n                              10.22 c.c. N/10 NaOH }\r\n\r\n    10.2 x F N/10 NaOH (0.996) = Factor N/40 stearic acid\r\n\r\n        Therefore Factor N/40 stearic acid = 1.016.\r\n\r\nThird--About 5 grams of soap are weighed and dissolved in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of 50 per cent. neutralized alcohol in a 250 cubic\r\ncentimeter Erlenmeyer flask over a water bath and connected with a\r\nreflux condensor. When completely dissolved, which takes but a few\r\nmoments, it is cooled by allowing a stream of running water to run over\r\nthe outside of the flask.\r\n\r\nFourth--The soap is precipitated with 15 to 20 cubic centimeters of the\r\n10 per cent. barium chloride solution.\r\n\r\nFifth--After the addition of 2 to 5 cubic centimeters of [Greek: alpha]\r\nnaphtholphthalein solution the solution is titrated with N/40 alcoholic\r\nstearic acid. [Greek: alpha] naphtholphthalein is red with an excess of\r\nstearic acid. To mark the color changes it is advisable to first run a\r\nfew blanks until the eye has become accustomed to the change in the\r\nindicator in the same way. The change from green to red can then be\r\ncarefully observed.\r\n\r\nLet us presume 5 grams of soap were taken for the analysis and 20 cubic\r\ncentimeters of N/40 stearic acid were required for the titration then to\r\ncalculate the amount of NaOH since the stearic factor is 1.016.\r\n\r\n20 x 1.016 = 20.32 N/40 stearic acid really required.\r\n\r\n1 cubic centimeter N/40 stearic acid = 0.02 per cent. NaOH for 5 grams\r\nsoap.\r\n\r\n[Greek: Delta] 20.32 cubic centimeters N/40 stearic acid = 0.02 x 20.32\r\nper cent. NaOH for 5 grams soap.\r\n\r\nHence the soap contains 0.4064 per cent. NaOH.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, however, to make a correction by this method. When the\r\nfree alkali amounts to over 0.1 per cent. the correction is + 0.01, and\r\nwhen the free alkali exceeds 0.4 per cent. the correction is + 0.04,\r\nhence in the above case we multiply 0.004064 by 0.04, add this amount to\r\n0.004064 and multiply by 100 to obtain the true percentage. Should the\r\nalkalinity have been near 0.1 per cent. we would have multiplied by 0.01\r\nand added this.\r\n\r\nIf carbonate is also present in the soap, another 5 grams of soap is\r\ndissolved in 100 cubic centimeters of 50 per cent. alcohol and the\r\nsolution titrated directly after cooling with N/40 stearic acid, using\r\n[Greek: alpha] naphtholphthalein or phenolphthalein as an indicator,\r\nwithout the addition of barium chloride. From the difference of the two\r\ntitrations the alkali present as carbonate is determined.\r\n\r\nIf the decomposed soap solution is colorless with phenolphthalein, free\r\nfatty acids are present, which may be quickly determined with alcoholic\r\nN/10 sodium hydroxide.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSOLUBLE MATTER.\r\n\r\nThe insoluble matter in soap may consist of organic or inorganic\r\nsubstances. Among the organic substances which are usually present in\r\nsoap are oat meal, bran, sawdust, etc., while among the common inorganic\r\nor mineral compounds are pumice, silex, clay, talc, zinc oxide,\r\ninfusorial earth, sand or other material used as fillers.\r\n\r\nTo determine insoluble matter, 5 grams of soap are dissolved in 75 cubic\r\ncentimeters of hot water. The solution is filtered through a weighed\r\ngooch crucible or filter paper. The residue remaining on the filter is\r\nwashed with hot water until all the soap is removed, is then dried to\r\nconstant weight at 105 degrees C. and weighed. From the difference in\r\nweight of the gooch or filter paper and the dried residue remaining\r\nthereon after filtering and drying, the total percentage of insoluble\r\nmatter may easily be calculated. By igniting the residue and reweighing\r\nthe amount of insoluble mineral matter can be readily determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARCH AND GELATINE.\r\n\r\nShould starch or gelatine be present in soap it is necessary to extract\r\n5 grams of the soap with 100 cubic centimeters of 95 per cent.\r\nneutralized alcohol in a Soxhlet extractor until the residue on the\r\nextraction thimble is in a powder form. If necessary the apparatus\r\nshould be disconnected and any lumps crushed, as these may contain soap.\r\nThe residue remaining on the thimble consists of all substances present\r\nin soap, insoluble in alcohol. This is dried and weighed so that any\r\npercentage of impurities not actually determined can be found by\r\ndifference. Starch and gelatine are separated from carbonate, sulfate\r\nand borate by dissolving the latter out through a filter with cold\r\nwater. The starch and gelatine thus remaining can be determined by\r\nknown methods, starch by the method of direct hydrolysis[15] and\r\ngelatine by Kjeldahling and calculating the corresponding amount of\r\ngelatine from the percentage of nitrogen (17.9%) therein.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\nTOTAL FATTY AND RESIN ACIDS.\r\n\r\nTo the filtrate from the insoluble matter add 40 cubic centimeters of\r\nhalf normal sulfuric acid, all the acid being added at once. Boil, stir\r\nthoroughly for some minutes and keep warm on a water bath until the\r\nfatty acids have collected as a clear layer on the surface. Cool by\r\nplacing the beaker in ice and syphon off the acid water through a\r\nfilter. Should the fatty acids not readily congeal a weighed amount of\r\ndried bleached bees-wax or stearic acid may be added to the hot mixture.\r\nThis fuses with the hot mass and forms a firm cake of fatty acids upon\r\ncooling. Without removing the fatty acids from the beaker, add about 300\r\ncubic centimeters of hot water, cool, syphon off the water through the\r\nsame filter used before and wash again. Repeat washing, cooling and\r\nsyphoning processes until the wash water is no longer acid. When this\r\nstage is reached, dissolve any fatty acid which may have remained on the\r\nfilter with hot 95 per cent. alcohol into the beaker containing the\r\nfatty acids. Evaporate the alcohol and dry the beaker to constant weight\r\nover a water bath. The fatty acids thus obtained represent the combined\r\nfatty acids, uncombined fat and hydrocarbons.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF ROSIN.\r\n\r\nIf resin acids are present, this may be determined by the\r\nLiebermann-Storch reaction. To carry out this test shake 2 cubic\r\ncentimeters of the fatty acids with 5 cubic centimeters of acetic\r\nanhydride; warm slightly; cool; draw off the anhydride and add 1:1\r\nsulfuric acid. A violet color, which is not permanent, indicates the\r\npresence of rosin in the soap. The cholesterol in linseed or fish oil,\r\nwhich of course may be present in the soap, also give this reaction.\r\n\r\nShould resin acids be present, these may be separated by the Twitchell\r\nmethod, which depends upon the difference in the behavior of the fatty\r\nand resin acids when converted into their ethyl esters through the\r\naction of hydrochloric acid. This may be carried out as follows:\r\n\r\nThree grams of the dried mixed acids are dissolved in 25 cubic\r\ncentimeters of absolute alcohol in a 100 cubic centimeter stoppered\r\nflask; the flask placed in cold water and shaken. To this cooled\r\nsolution 25 cubic centimeters of absolute alcohol saturated with dry\r\nhydrochloric acid is added. The flask is shaken occasionally and the\r\naction allowed to continue for twenty minutes, then 10 grams of dry\r\ngranular zinc chloride are added, the flask shaken and again allowed to\r\nstand for twenty minutes. The contents of the flask are then poured into\r\n200 cubic centimeters of water in a 500 cubic centimeter beaker and the\r\nflask rinsed out with alcohol. A small strip of zinc is placed in the\r\nbeaker and the alcohol evaporated. The beaker is then cooled and\r\ntransferred to a separatory funnel, washing out the beaker with 50 cubic\r\ncentimeters of gasoline (boiling below 80 degrees C.) and extracting by\r\nshaking the funnel well. Draw off the acid solution after allowing to\r\nseparate and wash the gasoline with water until free from hydrochloric\r\nacid. Draw off the gasoline solution and evaporate the gasoline.\r\nDissolve the residue in neutral alcohol and titrate with standard alkali\r\nusing phenolphthalein as an indicator. One cubic centimeter of normal\r\nalkali equals 0.346 grams of rosin. The rosin may be gravimetrically\r\ndetermined by washing the gasoline extract with water, it not being\r\nnecessary to wash absolutely free from acid, then adding 0.5 gram of\r\npotassium hydroxide and 5 cubic centimeters of alcohol in 50 cubic\r\ncentimeters of water. Upon shaking the resin acids are rapidly\r\nsaponified and extracted by the dilute alkaline solution as rosin soaps,\r\nwhile the ethyl esters remain in solution in the gasoline. Draw off the\r\nsoap solution, wash the gasoline solution again with dilute alkali and\r\nunite the alkaline solutions. Decompose the alkaline soap solution with\r\nan excess of hydrochloric acid and weigh the resin acids liberated as in\r\nthe determination of total fatty acids.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lewkowitsch, the results obtained by the volumetric method\r\nwhich assumes a combining weight of 346 for resin acids, are very likely\r\nto be high. On the other hand those obtained by the gravimetric method\r\nare too low.\r\n\r\nLeiste and Stiepel[17] have devised a simpler method for the\r\ndetermination of rosin. They make use of the fact that the resin acids\r\nas sodium soaps are soluble in acetone and particularly acetone\r\ncontaining two per cent. water, while the fatty acid soaps are soluble\r\nin this solvent to the extent of only about 2 per cent. First of all it\r\nis necessary to show that the sample to be analyzed contains a mixture\r\nof resin and fatty acids. This may be done by the Liebermann-Storch\r\nreaction already described. Glycerine interferes with the method. Two\r\ngrams of fatty acids or 3 grams of soap are weighed in a nickel crucible\r\nand dissolved in 15-20 cubic centimeters of alcohol. The solution is\r\nthen neutralized with alcoholic sodium hydroxide, using phenolphthalein\r\nas an indicator. The mass is concentrated by heat over an asbestos plate\r\nuntil a slight film forms over it. Then about 10 grams of sharp,\r\ngranular, ignited sand are stirred in by means of a spatula, the alcohol\r\nfurther evaporated, the mixture being constantly stirred and then\r\nthoroughly dried in a drying oven. The solvent for the cooled mass is\r\nacetone containing 2 per cent. water. It is obtained from acetone dried\r\nby ignited sodium sulfate and adding 2 per cent. water by volume. One\r\nhundred cubic centimeters of this solvent are sufficient for extracting\r\nthe above. The extraction of the rosin soap is conducted by adding 10\r\ncubic centimeters of acetone eight times, rubbing the mass thoroughly\r\nwith a spatula and decanting. The decanted portions are combined in a\r\nbeaker and the suspended fatty soaps allowed to separate. The mixture is\r\nthen filtered into a previously weighed flask and washed several times\r\nwith the acetone remaining. The solution of rosin soap should show no\r\nseparation of solid matter after having evaporated to half the volume\r\nand allowing to cool. If a separation should occur another filtration\r\nand the slightest possible washing is necessary. To complete the\r\nanalysis, the acetone is completely evaporated and the mass dried to\r\nconstant weight in a drying oven. The weight found gives the weight of\r\nthe rosin soap. In conducting the determination, it is important to dry\r\nthe mixture of soap and sand thoroughly. In dealing with potash soaps it\r\nis necessary to separate the fatty acids from these and use them as\r\nacetone dissolves too great a quantity of a potash soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOTAL ALKALI.\r\n\r\nIn the filtrate remaining after having washed the fatty acids in the\r\ndetermination of total fatty and resin acids all the alkali present as\r\nsoap, as carbonate and as hydroxide remains in solution as sulfate. Upon\r\ntitrating this solution with half normal alkali the difference between\r\nthe half normal acid used in decomposing the soap and alkali used in\r\ntitrating the excess of acid gives the amount of total alkali in the\r\nsoap. By deducting the amount of free alkali present as carbonate or\r\nhydroxide previously found the amount of combined alkali in the soap may\r\nbe calculated.\r\n\r\nTo quickly determine total alkali in soap a weighed portion of the soap\r\nmay be ignited to a white ash and the ash titrated for alkalinity using\r\nmethyl orange as an indicator.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNSAPONIFIED MATTER.\r\n\r\nDissolve 5 grams of soap in 50 cubic centimeters of 50 per cent.\r\nalcohol. Should any free fatty acids be present neutralize them with\r\nstandard alkali. Wash into a separatory funnel with 50 per cent. alcohol\r\nand extract with 100 cubic centimeters of gasoline, boiling at 50\r\ndegrees to 60 degrees C. Wash the gasoline with water, draw off the\r\nwatery layer. Run the gasoline into a weighed dish, evaporate the\r\nalcohol, dry and weigh the residue as unsaponified matter. The residue\r\ncontains any hydrocarbon oils or fats not converted into soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILICA AND SILICATES.\r\n\r\nThe insoluble silicates, sand, etc., are present in the ignited residue\r\nin the determination of insoluble matter. Sodium silicate, extensively\r\nused as a filler, however, will only show itself in forming a pasty\r\nliquid. Where it is desired to determine sodium silicate, 10 grams of\r\nsoap are ashed by ignition, hydrochloric acid added to the ash in excess\r\nand evaporated to dryness. More hydrochloric acid is then added and the\r\nmass is again evaporated until dry; then cooled; moistened with\r\nhydrochloric acid; dissolved in water; filtered; washed; the filtrate\r\nevaporated to dryness and again taken up with hydrochloric acid and\r\nwater; filtered and washed. The precipitates are then combined and\r\nignited. Silicon dioxide (SiO_{2}) is thus formed, which can be\r\ncalculated to sodium silicate (Na_{2}Si_{4}O_{9}). Should other metals\r\nthan alkali metals be suspected present the filtrate from the silica\r\ndeterminations should be examined.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLYCERINE IN SOAP.\r\n\r\nTo determine the amount of glycerine contained in soap dissolve 25 grams\r\nin hot water, add a slight excess of sulfuric acid and keep hot until\r\nthe fatty acids form as a clear layer on top. Cool the mass and remove\r\nthe fatty acids. Filter the acid solution into a 25 cubic centimeter\r\ngraduated flask; bring to the mark with water and determine the\r\nglycerine by the bichromate method as described under glycerine\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nWhen sugar is present the bichromate would be reduced by the sugar,\r\nhence this method is not applicable. In this case remove the fatty acids\r\nas before, neutralize an aliquot portion with milk of lime, evaporate to\r\n10 cubic centimeters, add 2 grams of sand and milk of lime containing\r\nabout 2 grams of calcium hydroxide and evaporate almost to dryness.\r\nTreat the moist residue with 5 cubic centimeters of 96 per cent.\r\nalcohol, rub the whole mass into a paste, then constantly stirring, heat\r\non a water bath and decant into a 250 cubic centimeter graduated flask.\r\nRepeat the washing with 5 cubic centimeters of alcohol five or six\r\ntimes, each time pouring the washings into the flask; cool the flask to\r\nroom temperature and fill to the mark with 96 per cent. alcohol, agitate\r\nthe flask until well mixed and filter through a dry filter paper. Take\r\n200 cubic centimeters of the nitrate and evaporate to a syrupy\r\nconsistency over a safety water bath. Wash the liquor into a stoppered\r\nflask with 20 cubic centimeters of absolute alcohol, add 30 cubic\r\ncentimeters of absolute ether 10 cubic centimeters at a time, shaking\r\nwell after each addition and let stand until clear. Pour off the\r\nsolution through a filter into a weighed dish and wash out the flask\r\nwith a mixture of three parts absolute ether and two parts absolute\r\nalcohol. Evaporate to a syrup, dry for one hour at the temperature of\r\nboiling water, weigh, ignite and weigh again. The loss is glycerine.\r\nThis multiplied by 5/4 gives the total loss for the aliquot portion\r\ntaken. The glycerine may also be determined by the acetin or bichromate\r\nmethods after driving off the alcohol and ether if so desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR IN SOAP.\r\n\r\nTo determine sugar in soap, usually present in transparent soaps,\r\ndecompose a soap solution of 5 grams of soap dissolved in 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters of hot water with an excess of hydrochloric acid and\r\nseparate the fatty acids as usual. Filter the acid solution into a\r\ngraduated flask and make up to the mark. Take an aliquot containing\r\napproximately 1 per cent. of reducing sugar and determine the amount of\r\nsugar by the Soxhlet method.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\nGLYCERINE ANALYSIS.\r\n\r\nThe methods of analyzing glycerine varied so greatly due to the fact\r\nthat glycerine contained impurities which acted so much like glycerine\r\nas to introduce serious errors in the determinations of crude glycerine.\r\nThis led to the appointment of committees in the United States and\r\nEurope to investigate the methods of glycerine analysis. An\r\ninternational committee met after their investigations and decided the\r\nacetin method should control the buying and selling of glycerine, but\r\nthe more convenient bichromate method in a standardized form might be\r\nused in factory control and other technical purposes. The following are\r\nthe methods of analysis and sampling as suggested by the international\r\ncommittee:\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMPLING.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory method available for sampling crude glycerine\r\nliable to contain suspended matter, or which is liable to deposit salt\r\non settling, is to have the glycerine sampled by a mutually approved\r\nsampler as soon as possible after it is filled into drums, but in any\r\ncase before any separation of salt has taken place. In such cases he\r\nshall sample with a sectional sampler (see appendix) then seal the\r\ndrums, brand them with a number for identification, and keep a record of\r\nthe brand number. The presence of any visible salt or other suspended\r\nmatter is to be noted by the sampler, and a report of the same made in\r\nhis certificate, together with the temperature of the glycerine. Each\r\ndrum must be sampled. Glycerine which has deposited salt or other solid\r\nmatter cannot be accurately sampled from the drums, but an approximate\r\nsample can be obtained by means of the sectional sampler, which will\r\nallow a complete vertical section of the glycerine to be taken including\r\nany deposit.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS.\r\n\r\n1. _Determination of Free Caustic Alkali._--Put 20 grams of the sample\r\ninto a 100 cc. flask, dilute with approximately 50 cc. of freshly boiled\r\ndistilled water, add an excess of neutral barium chloride solution, 1\r\ncc. of phenolphthalein solution, make up to the mark and mix. Allow the\r\nprecipitate to settle, draw off 50 cc. of the clear liquid and titrate\r\nwith normal acid (_N_/1). Calculate the percentage of Na_{2}O existing\r\nas caustic alkali.\r\n\r\n2. _Determination of Ash and Total Alkalinity._--Weigh 2 to 5 grams of\r\nthe sample in a platinum dish, burn off the glycerine over a luminous\r\nArgand burner or other source of heat,[19] giving a low temperature, to\r\navoid volatilization and the formation of sulphides. When the mass is\r\ncharred to the point that water will not be colored by soluble organic\r\nmatter, lixiviate with hot distilled water, filter, wash and ignite the\r\nresidue in the platinum dish. Return the filtrate and washings to the\r\ndish, evaporate the water, and carefully ignite without fusion. Weigh\r\nthe ash.\r\n\r\nDissolve the ash in distilled water and titrate total alkalinity, using\r\nas indicator methyl orange cold or litmus boiling.\r\n\r\n3. _Determination of Alkali Present as Carbonate._--Take 10 grams of the\r\nsample, dilute with 50 cc. distilled water, add sufficient _N_/1 acid to\r\nneutralize the total alkali found at (2), boil under a reflux condenser\r\nfor 15 to 20 minutes, wash down the condenser tube with distilled water,\r\nfree from carbon dioxide, and then titrate back with _N_/1 NaOH, using\r\nphenolphthalein as indicator. Calculate the percentage of Na_{2}O.\r\nDeduct the Na_{2}O found in (1). The difference is the percentage of\r\nNa_{2}O existing as carbonate.\r\n\r\n4. _Alkali Combined with Organic Acids._--The sum of the percentages of\r\nNa_{2}O found at (1) and (3) deducted from the percentage found at (2)\r\nis a measure of the Na_{2}O or other alkali combined with organic acids.\r\n\r\n5. _Determination of Acidity._--Take 10 grams of the sample, dilute with\r\n50 cc. distilled water free from carbon dioxide, and titrate with _N_/1\r\nNaOH and phenolphthalein. Express in terms of Na_{2}O required to\r\nneutralize 100 grams.\r\n\r\n6. _Determination of Total Residue at 160deg. C._--For this determination\r\nthe crude glycerine should be slightly alkaline with Na_{2}CO_{3} not\r\nexceeding 0.2 per cent. Na_{2}O, in order to prevent loss of organic\r\nacids. To avoid the formation of polyglycerols this alkalinity must not\r\nbe exceeded.\r\n\r\nTen grams of the sample are put into a 100 cc. flask, diluted with water\r\nand the calculated quantity of _N_/1 HCl or Na_{2}CO_{3} added to give\r\nthe required degree of alkalinity. The flask is filled to 100 cc., the\r\ncontents mixed, and 10 cc. measured into a weighed Petrie or similar\r\ndish 2.5 in. in diameter and 0.5 in. deep, which should have a flat\r\nbottom. In the case of crude glycerine abnormally high in organic\r\nresidue a smaller amount should be taken, so that the weight of the\r\norganic residue does not materially exceed 30 to 40 milligrams.\r\n\r\nThe dish is placed on a water bath (the top of the 160deg. oven acts\r\nequally well) until most of the water has evaporated. From this point\r\nthe evaporation is effected in the oven. Satisfactory results are\r\nobtained in an oven[20] measuring 12 ins. cube, having an iron plate\r\n0.75 in. thick lying on the bottom to distribute the heat. Strips of\r\nasbestos millboard are placed on a shelf half way up the oven. On these\r\nstrips the dish containing the glycerine is placed.\r\n\r\nIf the temperature of the oven has been adjusted to 160deg. C. with the\r\ndoor closed, a temperature of 130deg. to 140deg. can be readily maintained\r\nwith the door partially open, and the glycerine, or most of it, should\r\nbe evaporated off at this temperature. When only a slight vapor is seen\r\nto come off, the dish is removed and allowed to cool.\r\n\r\nAn addition of 0.5 to 1.0 cc. of water is made, and by a rotary motion\r\nthe residue brought wholly or nearly into solution. The dish is then\r\nallowed to remain on a water bath or top of the oven until the excess\r\nwater has evaporated and the residue is in such a condition that on\r\nreturning to the oven at 160deg. C. it will not spurt. The time taken up to\r\nthis point cannot be given definitely, nor is it important. Usually two\r\nor three hours are required. From this point, however, the schedule of\r\ntime must be strictly adhered to. The dish is allowed to remain in the\r\noven, the temperature of which is carefully maintained at 160deg. C. for\r\none hour, when it is removed, cooled, the residue treated with water,\r\nand the water evaporated as before. The residue is then subjected to a\r\nsecond baking of one hour, after which the dish is allowed to cool in a\r\ndesiccator over sulphuric acid and weighed. The treatment with water,\r\netc., is repeated until a constant loss of 1 to 1.5 mg. per hour is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIn the case of acid glycerine a correction must be made for the alkali\r\nadded 1 cc. _N_/1 alkali represents an addition of 0.03 gram. In the\r\ncase of alkaline crudes a correction should be made for the acid added.\r\nDeduct the increase in weight due to the conversion of the NaOH and\r\nNa_{2}CO_{3} to NaCl. The corrected weight multiplied by 100 gives the\r\npercentage of _total residue at 160deg. C._\r\n\r\nThis residue is taken for the determination of the non-volatile\r\nacetylizable impurities (see acetin method).\r\n\r\n7. _Organic residue._--Subtract the ash from the total residue at 160deg.\r\nC. Report as organic residue at 160deg. C. (it should be noted that\r\nalkaline salts of fatty acids are converted to carbonates on ignition\r\nand that the CO_{3} thus derived is not included in the organic\r\nresidue).\r\n\r\n\r\nACETIN PROCESS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF GLYCEROL.\r\n\r\nThis process is the one agreed upon at a conference of delegates from\r\nthe British, French, German and American committees, and has been\r\nconfirmed by each of the above committees as giving results nearer to\r\nthe truth than the bichromate method on crudes in general. It is the\r\nprocess to be used (if applicable) whenever only one method is employed.\r\nOn pure glycerines the results are identical with those obtained by the\r\nbichromate process. For the application of this method the crude\r\nglycerine should not contain over 60 per cent. water.\r\n\r\n\r\nREAGENTS REQUIRED.\r\n\r\n(_A_) _Best Acetic Anhydride._--This should be carefully selected. A\r\ngood sample must not require more than 0.1 cc. normal NaOH for\r\nsaponification of the impurities when a blank is run on 7.5 cc. Only a\r\nslight color should develop during digestion of the blank.\r\n\r\nThe anhydride may be tested for strength by the following method: Into a\r\nweighed stoppered vessel, containing 10 to 20 cc. of water, run about 2\r\ncc. of the anhydride, replace the stopper and weigh. Let stand with\r\noccasional shaking, for several hours, to permit the hydrolysis of all\r\nthe anhydride; then dilute to about 200 cc., add phenolphthalein and\r\ntitrate with _N_/1 NaOH. This gives the total acidity due to free acetic\r\nacid and acid formed from the anhydride. It is worthy of note that in\r\nthe presence of much free anhydride a compound is formed with\r\nphenolphthalein, soluble in alkali and acetic acid, but insoluble in\r\nneutral solutions. If a turbidity is noticed toward the end of the\r\nneutralization it is an indication that the anhydride is incompletely\r\nhydrolyzed and inasmuch as the indicator is withdrawn from the solution,\r\nresults may be incorrect.\r\n\r\nInto a stoppered weighing bottle containing a known weight of recently\r\ndistilled aniline (from 10 to 20 cc.) measure about 2 cc. of the sample,\r\nstopper, mix, cool and weigh. Wash the contents into about 200 cc. of\r\ncold water, and titrate the acidity as before. This yields the acidity\r\ndue to the original, preformed, acetic acid plus one-half the acid due\r\nto anhydride (the other half having formed acetanilide); subtract the\r\nsecond result from the first (both calculated to 100 grams) and double\r\nthe result, obtaining the cc. _N_/1 NaOH per 100 grams of the sample. 1\r\ncc. _N_/NaOH equals 0.0510 anhydride.\r\n\r\n(_B_) _Pure Fused Sodium Acetate._--The purchased salt is again\r\ncompletely fused in a platinum, silica or nickel dish, avoiding\r\ncharring, powdered quickly and kept in a stoppered bottle or desiccator.\r\nIt is most important that the sodium acetate be anhydrous.\r\n\r\n(_C_) _A Solution of Caustic Soda for Neutralizing, of about N_/1\r\n_Strength, Free from Carbonate._--This can be readily made by dissolving\r\npure sodium hydroxide in its own weight of water (preferably water free\r\nfrom carbon dioxide) and allowing to settle until clear, or filtering\r\nthrough an asbestos or paper filter. The clear solution is diluted with\r\nwater free from carbon dioxide to the strength required.\r\n\r\n(_D_) _N_/1 _Caustic Soda Free from Carbonate._--Prepared as above and\r\ncarefully standardized. Some caustic soda solutions show a marked\r\ndiminution in strength after being boiled; such solutions should be\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\n(_E_) _N_/1 _Acid._--Carefully standardized.\r\n\r\n(_F_) _Phenolphthalein Solution._--0.5 per cent. phenolphthalein in\r\nalcohol and neutralized.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE METHOD.\r\n\r\nIn a narrow-mouthed flask (preferably round-bottomed), capacity about\r\n120 cc., which has been thoroughly cleaned and dried, weigh accurately\r\nand as rapidly as possible 1.25 to 1.5 grams of the glycerine. A Grethan\r\nor Lunge pipette will be found convenient. Add about 3 grams of the\r\nanhydrous sodium acetate, then 7.5 cc. of the acetic anhydride, and\r\nconnect the flask with an upright Liebig condenser. For convenience the\r\ninner tube of this condenser should not be over 50 cm. long and 9 to 10\r\nmm. inside diameter. The flask is connected to the condenser by either a\r\nground glass joint (preferably) or a rubber stopper. If a rubber stopper\r\nis used it should have had a preliminary treatment with hot acetic\r\nanhydride vapor.\r\n\r\nHeat the contents and keep just boiling for one hour, taking precautions\r\nto prevent the salts drying on the sides of the flask.\r\n\r\nAllow the flask to cool somewhat, and through the condenser tube add 50\r\ncc. of distilled water free from carbon dioxide at a temperature of\r\nabout 80deg. C., taking care that the flask is not loosened from the\r\ncondenser. The object of cooling is to avoid any sudden rush of vapors\r\nfrom the flask on adding water, and to avoid breaking the flask. Time is\r\nsaved by adding the water before the contents of the flask solidify, but\r\nthe contents may be allowed to solidify and the test proceeded with the\r\nnext day without detriment, bearing in mind that the anhydride in excess\r\nis much more effectively hydrolyzed in hot than in cold water. The\r\ncontents of the flask may be warmed to, but must not exceed, 80deg. C.,\r\nuntil the solution is complete, except a few dark flocks representing\r\norganic impurities in the crude. By giving the flask a rotary motion,\r\nsolution is more quickly effected.\r\n\r\nCool the flask and contents without loosening from the condenser. When\r\nquite cold wash down the inside of the condenser tube, detach the flask,\r\nwash off the stopper or ground glass connection into the flask, and\r\nfilter the contents through an acid-washed filter into a Jena glass\r\nflask of about 1 litre capacity. Wash thoroughly with cold distilled\r\nwater free from carbon dioxide. Add 2 cc. of phenolphthalein solution\r\n(_F_), then run in caustic soda solution (_C_) or (_D_) until a faint\r\npinkish yellow color appears throughout the solution. This\r\nneutralization must be done most carefully; the alkali should be run\r\ndown the sides of the flask, the contents of which are kept rapidly\r\nswirling with occasional agitation or change of motion until the\r\nsolution is nearly neutralized, as indicated by the slower disappearance\r\nof the color developed locally by the alkali running into the mixture.\r\nWhen this point is reached the sides of the flask are washed down with\r\ncarbon dioxide-free water and the alkali subsequently added drop by\r\ndrop, mixing after each drop until the desired tint is obtained.\r\n\r\nNow run in from a burette 50 cc. or a calculated excess of _N_/1 NaOH\r\n(_D_) and note carefully the exact amount. Boil gently for 15 minutes,\r\nthe flask being fitted with a glass tube acting as a partial condenser.\r\nCool as quickly as possible and titrate the excess of NaOH with _N_/1\r\nacid (_E_) until the pinkish yellow or chosen end-point color just\r\nremains.[21] A further addition of the indicator at this point will\r\ncause an increase of the pink color; this must be neglected, and the\r\nfirst end-point taken.\r\n\r\nFrom the _N_/1 NaOH consumed calculate the percentage of glycerol\r\n(including acetylizable impurities) after making the correction for the\r\nblank test described below.\r\n\r\n1 cc. _N_/1 NaOH = 0.03069 gram glycerol.\r\n\r\nThe coefficient of expansion for normal solutions is 0.00033 per cc.\r\nfor each degree centigrade. A correction should be made on this account\r\nif necessary.\r\n\r\n_Blank Test._--As the acetic anhydride and sodium acetate may contain\r\nimpurities which affect the result, it is necessary to make a blank\r\ntest, using the same quantities of acetic anhydride, sodium acetate and\r\nwater as in the analysis. It is not necessary to filter the solution of\r\nthe melt in this case, but sufficient time must be allowed for the\r\nhydrolysis of the anhydride before proceeding with the neutralization.\r\nAfter neutralization it is not necessary to add more than 10 cc. of the\r\n_N_/1 alkali (_D_), as this represents the excess usually present after\r\nthe saponification of the average soap lye crude. In determining the\r\nacid equivalent of the _N_/1 NaOH, however, the entire amount taken in\r\nthe analysis, 50 cc., should be titrated after dilution with 300 cc.\r\nwater free from carbon dioxide and without boiling.\r\n\r\n_Determination of the Glycerol Value of the Acetylizable\r\nImpurities._--The total residue at 160deg. C. is dissolved in 1 or 2 cc. of\r\nwater, washed into the acetylizing flask and evaporated to dryness. Then\r\nadd anhydrous sodium acetate and acetic anhydride in the usual amounts\r\nand proceed as described in the regular analysis. After correcting for\r\nthe blank, calculate the result to glycerol.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAYS OF CALCULATING ACTUAL GLYCEROL CONTENT.\r\n\r\n(1) Determine the apparent percentage of glycerol in the sample by the\r\nacetin process as described. The result will include acetylizable\r\nimpurities if any are present.\r\n\r\n(2) Determine the total residue at 160deg. C.\r\n\r\n(3) Determine the acetin value of the residue at (2) in terms of\r\nglycerol.\r\n\r\n(4) Deduct the result found at (3) from the percentage obtained at (1)\r\nand report this corrected figure as glycerol. If volatile acetylizable\r\nimpurities are present these are included in this figure.\r\n\r\nTrimethyleneglycol is more volatile than glycerine and can therefore be\r\nconcentrated by fractional distillation. An approximation to the\r\nquantity can be obtained from the spread between the acetin and\r\nbichromate results on such distillates. The spread multiplied by 1.736\r\nwill give the glycol.\r\n\r\n\r\nBICHROMATE PROCESS FOR GLYCEROL DETERMINATION. REAGENTS REQUIRED.\r\n\r\n(_A_) _Pure potassium bichromate_ powdered and dried in air free from\r\ndust or organic vapors, at 110deg. to 120deg. C. This is taken as the\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n(_B_) _Dilute Bichromate Solution._--7.4564 grams of the above\r\nbichromate are dissolved in distilled water and the solution made up to\r\none liter at 15.5deg. C.\r\n\r\n(_C_) _Ferrous Ammonium Sulphate._--It is never safe to assume this salt\r\nto be constant in composition and it must be standardized against the\r\nbichromate as follows: dissolve 3.7282 grams of bichromate (_A_) in 50\r\ncc. of water. Add 50 cc. of 50 per cent. sulphuric acid (by volume), and\r\nto the cold undiluted solution add from a weighing bottle a moderate\r\nexcess of the ferrous ammonium sulphate, and titrate back with the\r\ndilute bichromate (_B_). Calculate the value of the ferrous salt in\r\nterms of bichromate.\r\n\r\n(_D_) _Silver Carbonate._--This is prepared as required for each test\r\nfrom 140 cc. of 0.5 per cent. silver sulphate solution by precipitation,\r\nwith about 4.9 cc. _N_/1 sodium carbonate solution (a little less than\r\nthe calculated quantity of _N_/1 sodium carbonate should be used as an\r\nexcess to prevent rapid settling). Settle, decant and wash one by\r\ndecantation.\r\n\r\n(_E_) _Subacetate of Lead._--Boil a 10 per cent. solution of pure lead\r\nacetate with an excess of litharge for one hour, keeping the volume\r\nconstant, and filter while hot. Disregard any precipitate which\r\nsubsequently forms. Preserve out of contact with carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\n(_F_) _Potassium Ferricyanide._--A very dilute, freshly prepared\r\nsolution containing about 0.1 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE METHOD.\r\n\r\nWeigh 20 grams of the glycerine, dilute to 250 cc. and take 25 cc. Add\r\nthe silver carbonate, allow to stand, with occasional agitation, for\r\nabout 10 minutes, and add a slight excess (about 5 cc. in most cases) of\r\nthe basic lead acetate (_E_), allow to stand a few minutes, dilute with\r\ndistilled water to 100 cc., and then add 0.15 cc. to compensate for the\r\nvolume of the precipitate, mix thoroughly, filter through an air-dry\r\nfilter into a suitable narrow-mouthed vessel, rejecting the first 10\r\ncc., and return the filtrate if not clear and bright. Test a portion of\r\nthe filtrate with a little basic lead acetate, which should produce no\r\nfurther precipitate (in the great majority of cases 5 cc. are ample, but\r\noccasionally a crude will be found requiring more, and in this case\r\nanother aliquot of 25 cc. of the dilute glycerine should be taken and\r\npurified with 6 cc. of the basic acetate). Care must be taken to avoid a\r\nmarked excess of basic acetate.\r\n\r\nMeasure off 25 cc. of the clear filtrate into a flask or beaker\r\n(previously cleaned with potassium bichromate and sulphuric acid). Add\r\n12 drops of sulphuric acid (1: 4) to precipitate the small excess of\r\nlead as sulphate. Add 3.7282 grams of the powdered potassium bichromate\r\n(_A_). Rinse down the bichromate with 25 cc. of water and let stand with\r\noccasional shaking until all the bichromate is dissolved (no reduction\r\nwill take place in the cold).\r\n\r\nNow add 50 cc. of 50 per cent. sulphuric acid (by volume) and immerse\r\nthe vessel in boiling water for two hours and keep protected from dust\r\nand organic vapors, such as alcohol, till the titration is completed.\r\nAdd from a weighing bottle a slight excess of the ferrous ammonium\r\nsulphate (_C_), making spot tests on a porcelain plate with the\r\npotassium ferricyanide (_F_). Titrate back with the dilute bichromate.\r\nFrom the amount of bichromate reduced calculate the percentage of\r\nglycerol.\r\n\r\n1 gram glycerol = 7.4564 grams bichromate.\r\n\r\n1 gram bichromate = 0.13411 gram glycerol.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of glycerol obtained above includes any oxidizable\r\nimpurities present after the purification. A correction for the\r\nnon-volatile impurities may be made by running a bichromate test on the\r\nresidue at 160deg. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n(1) It is important that the concentration of acid in the oxidation\r\nmixture and the time of oxidation should be strictly adhered to.\r\n\r\n(2) Before the bichromate is added to the glycerine solution it is\r\nessential that the slight excess of lead be precipitated with sulphuric\r\nacid, as stipulated.\r\n\r\n(3) For crudes practically free from chlorides the quantity of silver\r\ncarbonate may be reduced to one-fifth and the basic lead acetate to 0.5\r\ncc.\r\n\r\n(4) It is sometimes advisable to add a little potassium sulphate to\r\ninsure a clear filtrate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMPLING CRUDE GLYCERINE.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of sampling crude glycerine hitherto has been by means\r\nof a glass tube, which is slowly lowered into the drum with the object\r\nof taking as nearly as possible a vertical section of the glycerine\r\ncontained in the drum. This method has been found unsatisfactory, owing\r\nto the fact that in cold climates glycerine runs into the tube very\r\nslowly, so that, owing to the time occupied, it is impossible to take a\r\ncomplete section of the crude. Another objection to the glass tube is\r\nthat it fails to take anything approaching a correct proportion of any\r\nsettled salt contained in the drum.\r\n\r\nThe sampler which is illustrated herewith has been devised with the\r\nobject of overcoming the objections to the glass tube as far as\r\npossible. It consists of two brass tubes, one fitting closely inside the\r\nother. A number of ports are cut out in each tube in such a way that\r\nwhen the ports are opened a continuous slot is formed which enables a\r\ncomplete section to be taken throughout the entire length of the drum.\r\nBy this arrangement the glycerine fills into the sampler almost\r\ninstantaneously. There are a number of ports cut at the bottom of the\r\nsampler which render it possible to take a proportion of the salt at the\r\nbottom of the drum. The instrument is so constructed that all the ports,\r\nincluding the bottom ones, can be closed simultaneously by the simple\r\naction of turning the handle at the top; a pointer is arranged which\r\nindicates on a dial when the sampler is open or closed. In samplers of\r\nlarger section (1 in.) it is possible to arrange a third motion whereby\r\nthe bottom ports only are open for emptying, but in samplers of smaller\r\ndimensions (5/8 in.) this third motion must be dispensed with, otherwise\r\nthe dimensions of the ports have to be so small that the sampler would\r\nnot be efficient.\r\n\r\nIn using the sampler it is introduced into the drum with the ports\r\nclosed, and when it has touched the bottom, the ports are opened for a\r\nsecond or two, then closed and withdrawn, and the sample discharged into\r\nthe receiving vessel by opening the ports. When the drum contains salt\r\nwhich has deposited, the ports must be opened before the sampler is\r\npushed through the salt, thus enabling a portion to be included in the\r\nsample. It is, however, almost impossible to obtain a correct proportion\r\nof salt after it has settled in the drum and it is therefore recommended\r\nthat the drum be sampled before any salt has deposited. A sampler 1 in.\r\nin diameter withdraws approximately 10 oz. from a 110-gal. drum. A\r\nsampler 5/8 in. in diameter will withdraw about 5 oz.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Zeit. Angew.

It gives a strong draft at\r\nconstant temperature.\r\n\r\n[21] A precipitate at this point is an indication of the presence of\r\niron or alumina, and high results will be obtained unless a correction\r\nis made as described below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nStandard Methods for the Sampling and Analysis of Commercial Fats and\r\nOils[22]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following report of the _Committee on Analysis of Commercial Fats\r\nand Oils_ of the _Division of Industrial Chemists and Chemical\r\nEngineers_ of the American Chemical Society was adopted April 14, 1919,\r\nby unanimous vote:\r\n\r\nW. D. RICHARDSON, _Chairman_,\r\nSwift and Co., Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\nR. W. BAILEY,\r\nStillwell and Gladding, New York City.\r\n\r\nW. J. GASCOYNE,\r\nW. J. Gascoyne and Co., Baltimore, Md.\r\n\r\nI. KATZ,[A]\r\nWilson and Co., Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\nA. LOWENSTEIN,[A]\r\nMorris and Co., Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\nH. J. MORRISON,\r\nProctor and Gamble Co.,\r\nIvorydale, Ohio.\r\n\r\nJ. R. POWELL,\r\nArmour Soap Works, Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\nR. J. QUINN,[A]\r\nMidland Chemical Co., Argo, Ill.\r\n\r\nPAUL RUDNICK,\r\nArmour and Co., Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\nL. M. TOLMAN,\r\nWilson and Co., Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\nE. TWITCHELL,[A]\r\nEmery Candle Co., Cincinnati, Ohio.\r\n\r\nJ. J. VOLLERTSEN,\r\nMorris and Co., Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n[Note A: Resigned.]\r\n\r\n\r\nScope, Applicability and Limitations of the Methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOPE.\r\n\r\nThese methods are intended to aid in determining the commercial\r\nvaluation of fats and fatty oils in their purchase and sale, based on\r\nthe fundamental assumption commonly recognized in the trade, namely,\r\nthat the product is true to name and is not adulterated. For methods for\r\ndetermining the identity of oils and fats, the absence of adulterants\r\ntherein and for specific tests used in particular industries, the\r\nchemist is referred to standard works on the analysis of fats and oils.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLICABILITY.\r\n\r\nThe methods are applicable in commercial transactions involving fats and\r\nfatty oils used in the soap, candle and tanning industries, to edible\r\nfats and oils and to fats and fatty oils intended for lubricating and\r\nburning purposes. The methods are applicable to the raw oils used in the\r\nvarnish and paint industry with the exceptions noted under limitations,\r\nbut special methods have not been included.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMITATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe methods have not been developed with special reference to waxes\r\n(beeswax, carnauba wax, wool wax, etc.) although some of them may be\r\nfound applicable to these substances. The Committee considers the Wijs\r\nmethod superior to the Hanus method for the determination of iodine\r\nnumber of linseed oil as well as other oils, although the Hanus method\r\nhas been considered standard for this work for some time and has been\r\nadopted by the American Society for Testing Materials and in various\r\nspecifications. It has been customary to use the Huebl method for the\r\ndetermination of iodine value of tung oil (China wood oil) but the\r\nCommittee's work indicates that the Wijs method is satisfactory for this\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\n\r\nSampling.\r\n\r\n\r\nTANK CARS.\r\n\r\n1. SAMPLING WHILE LOADING--Sample shall be taken at discharge of pipe\r\nwhere it enters tank car dome. The total sample taken shall be not less\r\nthan 50 lbs. and shall be a composite of small samples of about 1 pound\r\neach, taken at regular intervals during the entire period of loading.\r\n\r\nThe sample thus obtained is thoroughly mixed and uniform 3-lb. portions\r\nplaced in air-tight 3-lb. metal containers. At least three such samples\r\nshall be put up, one for the buyer, one for the seller, and the third to\r\nbe sent to a referee chemist in case of dispute. All samples are to be\r\npromptly and correctly labeled and sealed.\r\n\r\n2. SAMPLING FROM CAR ON TRACK[23]--(_a_) _When contents are solid._[24]\r\nIn this case the sample is taken by means of a large tryer measuring\r\nabout 2 in. across and about 1-1/2 times the depth of the car in length.\r\nSeveral tryerfuls are taken vertically and obliquely toward the ends of\r\nthe car until 50 lbs. are accumulated, when the sample is softened,\r\nmixed and handled as under (1). In case the contents of the tank car\r\nhave assumed a very hard condition, as in Winter weather, so that it is\r\nimpossible to insert the tryer, and it becomes necessary to soften the\r\ncontents of the car by means of the closed steam coil (in nearly all\r\ntank cars the closed steam coil leaks) or by means of open steam in\r\norder to draw a proper sample, suitable arrangements must be made\r\nbetween buyer and seller for the sampling of the car after it is\r\nsufficiently softened, due consideration being given to the possible\r\npresence of water in the material in the car as received and also to the\r\npossible addition of water during the steaming. The Committee knows of\r\nno direct method for sampling a hard-frozen tank car of tallow in a\r\nsatisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _When contents are liquid._ The sample taken is to be a 50-lb.\r\ncomposite made up of numerous small samples taken from the top, bottom\r\nand intermediate points by means of a bottle or metal container with\r\nremovable stopper or top. This device attached to a suitable pole is\r\nlowered to the various desired depths, when the stopper or top is\r\nremoved and the container allowed to fill. The 50-lb. sample thus\r\nobtained is handled as under (1).\r\n\r\nIn place of the device described above, any sampler capable of taking a\r\nsample from the top, bottom, and center, or from a section through car,\r\nmay be used.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _When contents are in semi-solid condition, or when stearine has\r\nseparated from liquid portions._ In this case, a combination of (_a_)\r\nand (_b_) may be used or by agreement of the parties the whole may be\r\nmelted and procedure (_b_) followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARRELS, TIERCES, CASKS, DRUMS, AND OTHER PACKAGES.\r\n\r\nAll packages shall be sampled, unless by special agreement the parties\r\narrange to sample a lesser number; but in any case not less than 10 per\r\ncent of the total number shall be sampled. The total sample taken shall\r\nbe at least 20 lbs. in weight for each 100 barrels, or equivalent.\r\n\r\n1. BARRELS, TIERCES AND CASKS--(_a_) _When contents are solid._ The\r\nsmall samples shall be taken by a tryer through the bunghole or through\r\na special hole bored in the head or side for the purpose, with a 1-in.\r\nor larger auger. Care should be taken to avoid and eliminate all borings\r\nand chips from the sample. The tryer is inserted in such a way as to\r\nreach the head of the barrel, tierce, or cask. The large sample is\r\nsoftened, mixed and handled according to TANK CARS (1).\r\n\r\n(_b_) _When contents are liquid._ In this case use is made of a glass\r\ntube with constricted lower end. This is inserted slowly and allowed to\r\nfill with the liquid, when the upper end is closed and the tube\r\nwithdrawn, the contents being allowed to drain into the sample\r\ncontainer. After the entire sample is taken it is thoroughly mixed and\r\nhandled according to TANK CARS (1).\r\n\r\n(_c_) _When contents are semi-solid._ In this case the tryer or a glass\r\ntube with larger outlet is used, depending on the degree of fluidity.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Very hard materials, such as natural and artificial stearines._\r\nBy preference the barrels are stripped and samples obtained by breaking\r\nup contents of at least 10 per cent of the packages. This procedure is\r\nto be followed also in the case of cakes shipped in sacks. When shipped\r\nin the form of small pieces in sacks they can be sampled by grab\r\nsampling and quartering. In all cases the final procedure is as outlined\r\nunder TANK CARS (1).\r\n\r\n2. DRUMS--Samples are to be taken as under (1), use being made of the\r\nbunghole. The tryer or tube should be sufficiently long to reach to the\r\nends of the drum.\r\n\r\n3. OTHER PACKAGES--Tubs, pails and other small packages not mentioned\r\nabove are to be sampled by tryer or tube (depending on fluidity) as\r\noutlined above, the tryer or tube being inserted diagonally whenever\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n4. MIXED LOTS AND PACKAGES--When lots of tallow or other fats are\r\nreceived in packages of various shapes and sizes, and especially wherein\r\nthe fat itself is of variable composition, such must be left to the\r\njudgment of the sampler. If variable, the contents of each package\r\nshould be mixed as thoroughly as possible and the amount of the\r\nindividual samples taken made proportional to the sizes of the packages.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMPLE.\r\n\r\nThe sample must be representative and at least three pounds in weight\r\nand taken in accordance with the STANDARD METHODS FOR THE SAMPLING OF\r\nCOMMERCIAL FATS AND OILS. It must be kept in an air-tight container, in\r\na dark, cool place.\r\n\r\nSoften the sample if necessary by means of a gentle heat, taking care\r\nnot to melt it. When sufficiently softened, mix the sample thoroughly by\r\nmeans of a mechanical egg beater or other equally effective mechanical\r\nmixer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOISTURE AND VOLATILE MATTER.\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS: _Vacuum Oven_--The Committee Standard Oven.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION--The Standard F. A. C. Vacuum Oven has been designed with\r\nthe idea of affording a simple and compact vacuum oven which will give\r\nas uniform temperatures as possible on the shelf. As the figure shows,\r\nit consists of an iron casting of rectangular sections with hinged front\r\ndoor made tight by means of a gasket and which can be lowered on opening\r\nthe oven so as to form a shelf on which samples may be rested. The oven\r\ncontains but one shelf which is heated from above as well as below by\r\nmeans of resistance coils. Several thermometer holes are provided in\r\norder to ascertain definitely the temperature at different points on the\r\nshelf. In a vacuum oven where the heating is done almost entirely by\r\nradiation it is difficult to maintain uniform temperatures at all\r\npoints, but the F. A. C. oven accomplishes this rather better than most\r\nvacuum ovens. Larger ovens containing more than one shelf have been\r\ntried by the Committee, but have been found to be lacking in temperature\r\nuniformity and means of control. The entire oven is supported by means\r\nof a 4-in. standard pipe which screws into the base of the oven and\r\nwhich in turn is supported by being screwed into a blind flange of\r\nsuitable diameter which rests on the floor or work table.\r\n\r\n_Moisture Dish_--A shallow, glass dish, lipped, beaker form,\r\napproximately 6 to 7 cm. diameter and 4 cm. deep, shall be standard.\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION--Weigh out 5 grams (= 0.2 g. of the prepared sample) into\r\na moisture dish. Dry to constant weight in _vacuo_ at a uniform\r\ntemperature, not less than 15deg. C. nor more than 20deg. C. above the\r\nboiling point of water at the working pressure, which must not exceed\r\n100 mm. of mercury.[25] Constant weight is attained when successive\r\ndryings for 1-hr. periods show an additional loss of not more that 0.05\r\nper cent. Report loss in weight as MOISTURE AND VOLATILE MATTER.[26]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STANDARD VACUUM OVEN]\r\n\r\nThe vacuum-oven method cannot be considered accurate in the case of fats\r\nof the coconut oil group containing free acid and the Committee\r\nrecommends that it be used only for oils of this group when they contain\r\nless than 1 per cent free acid. In the case of oils of this group\r\ncontaining more than 1 per cent free acid, recourse should be had\r\ntemporarily to the routine control method for moisture and volatile\r\nmatter[27] until the Committee develops a more satisfactory method.\r\n\r\nThe air-oven method cannot be considered even approximately accurate in\r\nthe case of the drying and semi-drying oils and those of the coconut oil\r\ngroup. Therefore, in the case of such oils as cottonseed oil, maize oil\r\n(corn oil), soy bean oil, linseed oil, coconut oil, palm kernel oil,\r\netc., the vacuum-oven method should always be used, except in the case\r\nof fats of the coconut group containing more than 1 per cent free acid,\r\nas noted above.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSOLUBLE IMPURITIES.\r\n\r\nDissolve the residue from the moisture and volatile matter determination\r\nby heating it on a steam bath with 50 cc. of kerosene. Filter the\r\nsolution through a Gooch crucible properly prepared with asbestos,[28]\r\nwash the insoluble matter five times with 10-cc. portions of hot\r\nkerosene, and finally wash the residual kerosene out thoroughly with\r\npetroleum ether. Dry the crucible and contents to constant weight, as in\r\nthe determination of moisture and volatile matter and report results as\r\nINSOLUBLE IMPURITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLUBLE MINERAL MATTER.\r\n\r\nPlace the combined kerosene filtrate and kerosene washings from the\r\ninsoluble impurities determination in a platinum dish. Place in this an\r\nashless filter paper folded in the form of a cone, apex up. Light the\r\napex of the cone, whereupon the bulk of the kerosene burns quietly. Ash\r\nthe residue in a muffle, to constant weight, taking care that the\r\ndecomposition of alkaline earth carbonates is complete, and report the\r\nresult as SOLUBLE MINERAL MATTER.[29] When the percentage of soluble\r\nmineral matter amounts to more than 0.1 per cent, multiply the\r\npercentage by 10 and add this amount to the percentage of free fatty\r\nacids as determined.[30]\r\n\r\n\r\nFREE FATTY ACIDS.\r\n\r\nThe ALCOHOL[31] used shall be approximately 95 per cent ethyl alcohol,\r\nfreshly distilled from sodium hydroxide, which with phenolphthalein\r\ngives a definite and distinct end-point.\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION--Weigh 1 to 15 g. of the prepared sample into an\r\nErlenmeyer flask, using the smaller quantity in the case of\r\ndark-colored, high acid fats. Add 50 to 100 cc. hot, neutral alcohol,\r\nand titrate with _N_/2, _N_/4 or _N_/10 sodium hydroxide depending on\r\nthe fatty acid content, using phenolphthalein as indicator. Calculate to\r\noleic acid, except that in the case of palm oil the results may also be\r\nexpressed in terms of palmitic acid, clearly indicating the two methods\r\nof calculation in the report. In the case of coconut and palm kernel\r\noils, calculate to and report in terms of lauric acid in addition to\r\noleic acid, clearly indicating the two methods of calculation in the\r\nreport. In the case of fats or greases containing more than 0.1 per cent\r\nof soluble mineral matter, add to the percentages of free fatty acids as\r\ndetermined 10 times the percentage of bases in the soluble mineral\r\nmatter as determined.[30] This addition gives the equivalent of fatty\r\nacids combined with the soluble mineral matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTITER.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD THERMOMETER--The thermometer is graduated at zero and in tenth\r\ndegrees from 10deg. C. to 65deg. C., with one auxiliary reservoir at the\r\nupper end and another between the zero mark and the 10deg. mark. The\r\ncavity in the capillary tube between the zero mark and the 10deg. mark\r\nis at least 1 cm. below the 10deg. mark, the 10deg. mark is about 3 or 4\r\ncm. above the bulb, the length of the thermometer being about 37 cm.\r\nover all. The thermometer has been annealed for 75 hrs. at 450deg. C.\r\nand the bulb is of Jena normal 16''' glass, or its equivalent,\r\nmoderately thin, so that the thermometer will be quick-acting. The bulb\r\nis about 3 cm. long and 6 mm. in diameter. The stem of the thermometer\r\nis 6 mm. in diameter and made of the best thermometer tubing, with scale\r\netched on the stem, the graduation is clear-cut and distinct, but quite\r\nfine. The thermometer must be certified by the U. S. Bureau of\r\nStandards.\r\n\r\nGLYCEROL CAUSTIC SOLUTION--Dissolve 250 g. potassium hydroxide in 1900\r\ncc. dynamite glycerin with the aid of heat.\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION--Heat 75 cc. of the glycerol-caustic solution to 150deg.\r\nC. and add 50 g. of the melted fat. Stir the mixture well and continue\r\nheating until the melt is homogeneous, at no time allowing the\r\ntemperature to exceed 150deg. C. Allow to cool somewhat and carefully\r\nadd 50 cc. 30 per cent sulfuric acid. Now add hot water and heat until\r\nthe fatty acids separate out perfectly clear. Draw off the acid water\r\nand wash the fatty acids with hot water until free from mineral acid,\r\nthen filter and heat to 130deg. C. as rapidly as possible while\r\nstirring. Transfer the fatty acids, when cooled somewhat, to a 1-in. by\r\n4-in. titer tube, placed in a 16-oz. salt-mouth bottle of clear glass,\r\nfitted with a cork that is perforated so as to hold the tube rigidly\r\nwhen in position. Suspend the titer thermometer so that it can be used\r\nas a stirrer and stir the fatty acids slowly (about 100 revolutions per\r\nminute) until the mercury remains stationary for 30 seconds. Allow the\r\nthermometer to hang quietly with the bulb in the center of the tube and\r\nreport the highest point to which the mercury rises as the titer of the\r\nfatty acids. The titer should be made at about 20deg. C. for all fats\r\nhaving a titer above 30deg. C. and at 10deg. C. below the titer for all\r\nother fats. Any convenient means may be used for obtaining a temperature\r\nof 10deg. below the titer of the various fats. The committee recommends\r\nfirst of all a chill room for this purpose; second, an artificially\r\nchilled small chamber with glass window; third, immersion of the\r\nsalt-mouth bottle in water or other liquid of the desired temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNSAPONIFIABLE MATTER.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTION CYLINDER--The cylinder shall be glass-stoppered, graduated at\r\n40 cc., 80 cc. and 130 cc., and of the following dimensions: diameter\r\nabout 1-3/8 in., height about 12 in.\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM ETHER--Redistilled petroleum ether, boiling under 75deg. C.,\r\nshall be used. A blank must be made by evaporating 250 cc. with about\r\n0.25 g. of stearine or other hard fat (previously brought to constant\r\nweight by heating) and drying as in the actual determination. The blank\r\nmust not exceed a few milligrams.\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION--Weigh 5 g. (+-0.20 g.) of the prepared sample into a\r\n200-cc. Erlenmeyer flask, add 30 cc. of redistilled 95 per cent\r\n(approximately) ethyl alcohol and 5 cc. of 50 per cent aqueous potassium\r\nhydroxide, and boil the mixture for one hour under a reflux condenser.\r\nTransfer to the extraction cylinder and wash to the 40-cc. mark with\r\nredistilled 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. Complete the transfer, first with\r\nwarm, then with cold water, till the total volume amounts to 80 cc. Cool\r\nthe cylinder and contents to room temperature and add 50 cc. of\r\npetroleum ether. Shake _vigorously_ for one minute and allow to settle\r\nuntil both layers are clear, when the volume of the upper layer should\r\nbe about 40 cc. Draw off the petroleum ether layer as closely as\r\npossible by means of a slender glass siphon into a separatory funnel of\r\n500 cc. capacity. Repeat extraction at least four more times, using 50\r\ncc. of petroleum ether each time. More extractions than five are\r\nnecessary where the unsaponifiable matter runs high, say over 5 per\r\ncent, and also in some cases where it is lower than 5 per cent, but is\r\nextracted with difficulty. Wash the combined extracts in a separatory\r\nfunnel three times with 25-cc. portions of 10 per cent alcohol, shaking\r\nvigorously each time. Transfer the petroleum ether extract to a\r\nwide-mouth tared flask or beaker, and evaporate the petroleum ether on a\r\nsteam bath in an air current. Dry as in the method for MOISTURE AND\r\nVOLATILE MATTER. Any blank must be deducted from the weight before\r\ncalculating unsaponifiable matter. Test the final residue for solubility\r\nin 50 cc. petroleum ether at room temperature. Filter and wash free from\r\nthe insoluble residue, if any, evaporate and dry in the same manner as\r\nbefore. The Committee wishes to emphasize the necessity of thorough and\r\nvigorous shaking in order to secure accurate results. The two phases\r\nmust be brought into the most intimate contact possible, otherwise low\r\nand disagreeing results may be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nIODINE NUMBER--WIJS METHOD.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF REAGENTS--_Wijs Iodine Solution_--Dissolve 13.0 g. of\r\nresublimed iodine in one liter of C. P. glacial acetic acid and pass in\r\nwashed and dried chlorine gas until the original thiosulfate titration\r\nof the solution is not quite doubled. The solution is then preserved in\r\namber glass-stoppered bottles, sealed with paraffin until ready for use.\r\n\r\nMark the date on which the solution is prepared on the bottle or bottles\r\nand do not use Wijs solution which is more than 30 days old.\r\n\r\nThere should be no more than a slight excess of iodine, and no excess of\r\nchlorine. When the solution is made from iodine and chlorine, this point\r\ncan be ascertained by not quite doubling the titration.[32]\r\n\r\nThe glacial acetic acid used for preparation of the Wijs solution should\r\nbe of 99.0 to 99.5 per cent strength. In case of glacial acetic acids of\r\nsomewhat lower strength, the Committee recommends freezing and\r\ncentrifuging or draining as a means of purification.\r\n\r\n_N_/10 _Sodium Thiosulfate Solution_--Dissolve 24.8 g. of C. P. sodium\r\nthiosulfate in recently boiled distilled water and dilute with the same\r\nto one liter at the temperature at which the titrations are to be made.\r\n\r\n_Starch Paste_--Boil 1 g. of starch in 200 cc. of distilled water for 10\r\nmin. and cool to room temperature.\r\n\r\nAn improved starch solution may be prepared by autoclaving 2 g. of\r\nstarch and 6 g. of boric acid dissolved in 200 cc. water at 15 lbs.\r\npressure for 15 min. This solution has good keeping qualities.\r\n\r\n_Potassium Iodide Solution_--Dissolve 150 g. of potassium iodide in\r\nwater and make up to one liter.\r\n\r\n_N_/10 _Potassium Bichromate_--Dissolve 4.903 g. of C. P. potassium\r\nbichromate in water and make the volume up to one liter at the\r\ntemperature at which titrations are to be made.\r\n\r\nThe Committee calls attention to the fact that occasionally potassium\r\nbichromate is found containing sodium bichromate, although this is of\r\nrare occurrence. If the analyst suspects that he is dealing with an\r\nimpure potassium bichromate, the purity can be ascertained by titration\r\nagainst re-sublimed iodine. However, this is unnecessary in the great\r\nmajority of cases.\r\n\r\n_Standardization of the Sodium Thiosulfate Solution_--Place 40 cc. of\r\nthe potassium bichromate solution, to which has been added 10 cc. of the\r\nsolution of potassium iodide, in a glass-stoppered flask. Add to this 5\r\ncc. of strong hydro-chloric acid. Dilute with 100 cc. of water, and\r\nallow the _N_/10 sodium thiosulfate to flow slowly into the flask until\r\nthe yellow color of the liquid has almost disappeared. Add a few drops\r\nof the starch paste, and with constant shaking continue to add the\r\n_N_/10 sodium thiosulfate solution until the blue color just disappears.\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION--Weigh accurately from 0.10 to 0.50 g. (depending on the\r\niodine number) of the melted and filtered sample into a clean, dry,\r\n16-oz. glass-stoppered bottle containing 15-20 cc. of carbon\r\ntetrachloride or chloroform. Add 25 cc. of iodine solution from a\r\npipette, allowing to drain for a definite time. The excess of iodine\r\nshould be from 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the amount added, that is,\r\nfrom 100 per cent to 150 per cent of the amount absorbed. Moisten the\r\nstopper with a 15 per cent potassium iodide solution to prevent loss of\r\niodine or chlorine but guard against an amount sufficient to run down\r\ninside the bottle. Let the bottle stand in a dark place for 1/2 hr. at a\r\nuniform temperature. At the end of that time add 20 cc. of 15 per cent\r\npotassium iodide solution and 100 cc. of distilled water. Titrate the\r\niodine with _N_/10 sodium thiosulfate solution which is added gradually,\r\nwith constant shaking, until the yellow color of the solution has almost\r\ndisappeared. Add a few drops of starch paste and continue titration\r\nuntil the blue color has entirely disappeared. Toward the end of the\r\nreaction stopper the bottle and shake violently so that any iodine\r\nremaining in solution in the tetrachloride or chloroform may be taken up\r\nby the potassium iodide solution. Conduct two determinations on blanks\r\nwhich must be run in the same manner as the sample except that no fat is\r\nused in the blanks. Slight variations in temperature quite appreciably\r\naffect the titer of the iodine solution, as acetic acid has a high\r\ncoefficient of expansion. It is, therefore, essential that the blanks\r\nand determinations on the sample be made at the same time. The number of\r\ncc. of standard thiosulfate solution required by the blank, less the\r\namount used in the determination, gives the thiosulfate equivalent of\r\nthe iodine absorbed by the amount of sample used in the determination.\r\nCalculate to centigrams of iodine absorbed by 1 g. of sample (= per cent\r\niodine absorbed).\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION, TUNG OIL--Tung oil shows an erratic behavior with most\r\niodine reagents and this is particularly noticeable in the case of the\r\nHanus reagent which is entirely unsuitable for determining the iodine\r\nnumber of this oil since extremely high and irregular results are\r\nobtained. The Huebl solution shows a progressive absorption up to 24 hrs.\r\nand probably for a longer time but the period required is entirely too\r\nlong for a chemical determination. The Wijs solution gives good results\r\nif the following precautions are observed:\r\n\r\nWeigh out 0.15 +- 0.05 g., use an excess of 55 +- 3 per cent Wijs\r\nsolution. Conduct the absorption at a temperature of 20-25deg. C. for 1\r\nhr. In other respects follow the instructions detailed above.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAPONIFICATION NUMBER (KOETTSTORFER NUMBER).\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF REAGENTS. _N/2 Hydrochloric Acid_--Carefully\r\nstandardized.\r\n\r\n_Alcoholic Potassium Hydroxide Solution_--Dissolve 40 g. of pure\r\npotassium hydroxide in one liter of 95 per cent redistilled alcohol (by\r\nvolume). The alcohol should be redistilled from potassium hydroxide over\r\nwhich it has been standing for some time, or with which it has been\r\nboiled for some time, using a reflux condenser. The solution must be\r\nclear and the potassium hydroxide free from carbonates.\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION--Weigh accurate about 5 g. of the filtered sample into a\r\n250 to 300 cc. Erlenmeyer flask. Pipette 50 cc. of the alcoholic\r\npotassium hydroxide solution into the flask, allowing the pipette to\r\ndrain for a definite time. Connect the flask with an air condenser and\r\nboil until the fat is completely saponified (about 30 minutes). Cool and\r\ntitrate with the _N_/2 hydrochloric acid, using phenolphthalein as an\r\nindicator. Calculate the Koettstorfer number (mg. of potassium hydroxide\r\nrequired to saponify 1 g. of fat). Conduct 2 or 3 blank determinations,\r\nusing the same pipette and draining for the same length of time as\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELTING POINT.\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS--_Capillary tubes_ made from 5 mm. inside diameter thin-walled\r\nglass tubing drawn out to 1 mm. inside diameter. Length of capillary\r\npart of tubes to be about 5 cm. Length of tube over all 8 cm.\r\n\r\n_Standard thermometer_ graduated in tenths of a degree.\r\n\r\n_600 cc. beaker._\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION--The sample should be clear when melted and entirely free\r\nfrom moisture, or incorrect results will be obtained.\r\n\r\nMelt and thoroughly mix the sample. Dip three of the capillary tubes\r\nabove described in the oil so that the fat in the tube stands about 1\r\ncm. in height. Now fuse the capillary end carefully by means of a small\r\nblast flame and allow to cool. These tubes are placed in a refrigerator\r\nover night at a temperature of from 40 to 50deg. F. They are then\r\nfastened by means of a rubber band or other suitable means to the bulb\r\nof a thermometer graduated in tenths of a degree. The thermometer is\r\nsuspended in a beaker of water (which is agitated by air or other\r\nsuitable means) so that the bottom of the bulb of the thermometer is\r\nimmersed to a depth of about 3 cm. The temperature of the water is\r\nincreased gradually at the rate of about 1deg. per minute.\r\n\r\nThe point at which the sample becomes opalescent is first noted and the\r\nheating continued until the contents of the tube becomes uniformly\r\ntransparent. The latter temperature is reported as the melting point.\r\n\r\nBefore finally melting to a perfectly clear fluid, the sample becomes\r\nopalescent and usually appears clear at the top, bottom, and sides\r\nbefore becoming clear at the center. The heating is continued until the\r\ncontents of the tube become uniformly clear and transparent. This\r\ntemperature is reported as the melting point.[33] It is usually only a\r\nfraction of a degree above the opalescent point noted. The thermometer\r\nshould be read to the nearest 1/2deg. C., and in addition this\r\ntemperature may be reported to the nearest degree Fahrenheit if desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOUD TEST.\r\n\r\nPRECAUTIONS--(1) The oil must be perfectly dry, because the presence of\r\nmoisture will produce a turbidity before the clouding point is reached.\r\n\r\n(2) The oil must be heated to 150deg. C. over a free flame, immediately\r\nbefore making the test.\r\n\r\n(3) There must not be too much discrepancy between the temperature of\r\nthe bath and the clouding point of the oil. An oil that will cloud at\r\nthe temperature of hydrant water should be tested in a bath of that\r\ntemperature. An oil that will cloud in a mixture of ice and water should\r\nbe tested in such a bath. An oil that will not cloud in a bath of ice\r\nand water must be tested in a bath of salt, ice, and water.\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION--The oil is heated in a porcelain casserole over a free\r\nflame to 150deg. C., stirring with the thermometer. As soon as it can be\r\ndone with safety, the oil is transferred to a 4 oz. oil bottle, which\r\nmust be perfectly dry. One and one-half ounces of the oil are sufficient\r\nfor the test. A dry centigrade thermometer is placed in the oil, and the\r\nbottle is then cooled by immersion in a suitable bath. The oil is\r\nconstantly stirred with the thermometer, taking care not to remove the\r\nthermometer from the oil at any time during the test, so as to avoid\r\nstirring air bubbles into the oil. The bottle is frequently removed from\r\nthe bath for a few moments. The oil must not be allowed to chill on the\r\nsides and bottom of the bottle. This is effected by constant and\r\nvigorous stirring with the thermometer. As soon as the first permanent\r\ncloud shows in the body of the oil, the temperature at which this cloud\r\noccurs is noted.\r\n\r\nWith care, results concordant to within 1/2deg. C. can be obtained by\r\nthis method. A Fahrenheit thermometer is sometimes used because it has\r\nbecome customary to report results in degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe oil must be tested within a short time after heating to 150deg. C.\r\nand a re-test must always be preceded by reheating to that temperature.\r\nThe cloud point should be approached as quickly as possible, yet not so\r\nfast that the oil is frozen on the sides or bottom of the bottle before\r\nthe cloud test is reached.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes on the Above Methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMPLING.\r\n\r\nThe standard size of sample adopted by the committee is at least 3 lbs.\r\nin weight. The committee realizes that this amount is larger than any\r\nsamples usually furnished even when representing shipments of from\r\n20,000 to 60,000 lbs. but it believes that the requirement of a larger\r\nsample is desirable and will work toward uniform and more concordant\r\nresults in analysis. It will probably continue to be the custom of the\r\ntrade to submit smaller buyers' samples than required by the committee,\r\nbut these are to be considered only as samples for inspection and not\r\nfor analysis. The standard analytical sample must consist of 3 lbs. or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for keeping samples in a dark, cool place are obvious. This\r\nis to prevent any increase in rancidity and any undue increase in free\r\nfatty acids. In the case of many fats the committee has found in its\r\nco-operative analytical work that free acid tends to increase very\r\nrapidly. This tendency is minimized by low temperatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOISTURE AND VOLATILE MATTER.\r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration the committee has decided that moisture is\r\nbest determined in a vacuum oven of the design which accompanies the\r\nabove report. Numerous results on check samples have confirmed the\r\ncommittee's conclusions. The oven recommended by the committee is\r\nconstructed on the basis of well-known principles and it is hoped that\r\nthis type will be adopted generally by chemists who are called upon to\r\nanalyze fats and oils. The experiments of the committee indicate that it\r\nis a most difficult matter to design a vacuum oven which will produce\r\nuniform temperatures throughout; and one of the principal ideas in the\r\ndesign adopted is uniformity of temperature over the entire single\r\nshelf. This idea has not quite been realized in practice but,\r\nnevertheless, the present design approaches much closer to the ideal\r\nthan other vacuum ovens commonly used. In the drawing the essential\r\ndimensions are those between the heating units and the shelf and the\r\nlength and breadth of the outer casting. The standard Fat Analysis\r\nCommittee Oven (F. A. C. Oven) can be furnished by Messrs. E. H. Sargent\r\n& Company, 125 West Lake street, Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe committee realizes that for routine work a quicker method is\r\ndesirable and has added one such method and has also stated the\r\nconditions under which comparable results can be obtained by means of\r\nthe ordinary well-ventilated air oven held at 105 to 110deg. C. However,\r\nin accordance with a fundamental principle adopted by the committee at\r\nits first meeting, only one standard method is adopted and declared\r\nofficial for each determination.\r\n\r\nThe committee realizes that in the case of all methods for determining\r\nmoisture by means of loss on heating there may be a loss due to volatile\r\nmatter (especially fatty acids) other than water. The title of the\r\ndetermination MOISTURE AND VOLATILE MATTER indicates this idea, but any\r\nconsiderable error from this source may occur only in the case of high\r\nacid fats and oils and particularly those containing lower fatty acids\r\nsuch as coconut and palm kernel oil. In the case of extracted greases\r\nwhich have not been properly purified, some of the solvent may also be\r\nincluded in the moisture and volatile matter determination, but inasmuch\r\nas the solvent, usually a petroleum product, can only be considered as\r\nforeign matter, for commercial purposes, it is entirely proper to\r\ninclude it with the moisture.\r\n\r\nThe committee has also considered the various distillation methods for\r\nthe determination of moisture in fats and oils, but since according to\r\nthe fundamental principles which it was endeavoring to follow it could\r\nonly standardize one method, it was decided that the most desirable one\r\non the whole was the vacuum-oven method as given. There are cases\r\nwherein a chemist may find it desirable to check a moisture\r\ndetermination or investigate the moisture content of a fat or oil\r\nfurther by means of one of the distillation methods.\r\n\r\nHowever, in co-operative work the distillation method in various types\r\nof apparatus has not yielded satisfactory results. The difficulties\r\nappear to be connected with a proper choice of solvent and particularly\r\nwith the tendency of drops of water to adhere to various parts of the\r\nglass apparatus instead of passing on to the measuring device. When\r\nworking on coconut oil containing a high percentage of free fatty acids,\r\nconcordant results could not be obtained by the various members of the\r\ncommittee when working with identical samples, solvents and apparatus.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the committee found by individual work, co-operative\r\nwork and collaborative work by several members of the committee in one\r\nlaboratory, that the old, well-known direct heating method (which the\r\ncommittee has designated the hot plate method) yielded very satisfactory\r\nresults on all sorts of fats and oils including emulsions such as butter\r\nand oleomargarine and even on coconut oil samples containing 15 to 20\r\nper cent free fatty acids and 5 to 6 per cent of moisture.\r\nUnfortunately, this method depends altogether on the operator's skill\r\nand while the method may be taught to any person whether a chemist or\r\nnot so that he can obtain excellent results with it, it is difficult to\r\ngive a sufficiently, complete description of it so that any chemist\r\nanywhere after reading the description could follow it successfully. The\r\nmethod is undoubtedly worthy of much confidence in careful hands. It is\r\nquick, accurate and reliable. It is probably the best single method for\r\nthe determination of moisture in all sorts of samples for routine\r\nlaboratory work. On account of this fact the committee desires to\r\nannounce its willingness to instruct any person in the proper use of the\r\nmethod who desires to become acquainted with it and who will visit any\r\ncommittee member's laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSOLUBLE IMPURITIES.\r\n\r\nThis determination, the title for which was adopted after careful\r\nconsideration, determines the impurities which have generally been known\r\nas dirt, suspended matter, suspended solids, foreign solids, foreign\r\nmatter, etc., in the past. The first solvent recommended by the\r\ncommittee is hot kerosene to be followed by petroleum ether kept at\r\nordinary room temperature. Petroleum ether, cold or only slightly warm,\r\nis not a good fat and metallic soap solvent, whereas hot kerosene\r\ndissolves these substances readily, and for this reason the committee\r\nhas recommended the double solvent method so as to exclude metallic\r\nsoaps which are determined below as soluble mineral matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLUBLE MINERAL MATTER.\r\n\r\nSoluble mineral matter represents mineral matter combined with fatty\r\nacids in the form of soaps in solution in the fat or oil. Formerly, this\r\nmineral matter was often determined in combination by weighing the\r\nseparated metallic soap or by weighing it in conjunction with the\r\ninsoluble impurities. Since the soaps present consist mostly of lime\r\nsoap, it has been customary to calculate the lime present therein by\r\ntaking 0.1 the weight of the total metallic soaps. The standard method\r\nas given above is direct and involves no calculation. The routine method\r\ngiven in the note has been placed among the methods for the reason that\r\nit is used in some laboratories, but has not been adopted as a standard\r\nmethod in view of the fact that the committee has made it a rule to\r\nadopt only one standard method. It should be pointed out, however, that\r\nthe method cannot be considered accurate for the reason that insoluble\r\nimpurities may vary from sample to sample to a considerable extent and\r\nthe error due to the presence of large particles of insoluble impurities\r\nis thus transferred to the soluble mineral matter. The committee has\r\nfound one type of grease (naphtha bone grease) which shows most unusual\r\ncharacteristics. The type sample contains 4.3 per cent soluble mineral\r\nmatter by the committee method which would be equivalent to 43.0 per\r\ncent free fatty acid. The kerosene and gasoline filtrate was\r\nparticularly clear, nevertheless the ash was found to contain 36.43 per\r\ncent P_{2}O_{5} equivalent to 79.60 per cent of Ca_{3}(PO_{4})_{2} and\r\n9.63 per cent of Fe_{2}O_{3}. The method, therefore, determines the\r\nsoluble mineral matter in this case satisfactorily but the factor 10 is\r\nnot applicable for calculating the fatty acids combined therewith. It is\r\nnecessary, therefore, in order to determine the fatty acids combined\r\nwith soluble mineral matter in the original sample to determine the\r\nactual bases in the soluble mineral matter as obtained by ashing the\r\nkerosene and gasoline filtrate. To the bases so determined the factor 10\r\ncan then be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREE FATTY ACID.\r\n\r\nThe fatty acid method adopted is sufficiently accurate for commercial\r\npurposes. In many routine laboratories the fat or oil is measured and\r\nnot weighed, but the committee recommends weighing the sample in all\r\ncases. For scientific purposes the result is often expressed as \"acid\r\nnumber,\" meaning the number of milligrams of KOH required to neutralize\r\nthe free acids in one gram of fat, but the commercial practice has been,\r\nand is, to express the fatty acids as oleic acid or in the case of palm\r\noil, as palmitic acid, in some instances. The committee sees no\r\nobjection to the continuation of this custom so long as the analytical\r\nreport clearly indicates how the free acid is expressed. For a more\r\nexact expression of the free acid in a given fat, the committee\r\nrecommends that the ratio of acid number to saponification number be\r\nused. This method of expressing results is subject to error when\r\nunsaponifiable fatty matter is present, since the result expresses the\r\nratio of free fatty acid to total saponifiable fatty matter present.\r\n\r\n\r\nTITER.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the prices of glycerol and caustic potash are\r\nabnormally high, but the committee has considered that the methods\r\nadopted are for normal times and normal prices. For routine work during\r\nthe period of high prices the following method may be used for preparing\r\nthe fatty acids and is recommended by the committee:\r\n\r\nFifty grams of fat are saponified with 60 cc. of a solution of 2 parts\r\nof methyl alcohol to 1 of 50 per cent NaOH. The soap is dried,\r\npulverized and dissolved in 1000 cc. of water in a porcelain dish and\r\nthen decomposed with 25 cc. of 75 per cent sulphuric acid. The fatty\r\nacids are boiled until clear oil is formed and then collected and\r\nsettled in a 150-cc. beaker and filtered into a 50-cc. beaker. They are\r\nthen heated to 130deg. C. as rapidly as possible with stirring, and\r\ntransferred, after they have cooled somewhat, to the usual 1-in. by\r\n4-in. titer tube.\r\n\r\nThe method of taking the titer, including handling the thermometer, to\r\nbe followed is the same as that described in the standard method. Even\r\nat present high prices many laboratories are using the glycerol-caustic\r\npotash method for preparing the fatty acids, figuring that the saving of\r\ntime more than compensates for the extra cost of the reagents. Caustic\r\nsoda cannot be substituted for caustic potash in the glycerol method.\r\n\r\nUNSAPONIFIABLE MATTER.\r\n\r\nThe committee has considered unsaponifiable matter to include those\r\nsubstances frequently found dissolved in fats and oils which are not\r\nsaponified by the caustic alkalies and which at the same time are\r\nsoluble in the ordinary fat solvents. The term includes such substances\r\nas the higher alcohols, such as cholesterol which is found in animal\r\nfats, phytosterol found in some vegetable fats, paraffin and petroleum\r\noils, etc. UNSAPONIFIABLE MATTER should not be confused in the lay mind\r\nwith INSOLUBLE IMPURITIES OR SOLUBLE MINERAL MATTER.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted by the committee has been selected only after the\r\nmost careful consideration of other methods, such as the dry extraction\r\nmethod and the wet method making use of the separatory funnel. At first\r\nconsideration the dry extraction process would seem to offer the best\r\nbasis for an unsaponifiable matter method, but in practice it has been\r\nfound absolutely impossible for different analysts to obtain agreeing\r\nresults when using any of the dry extraction methods proposed.\r\nTherefore, this method had to be abandoned after numerous trials,\r\nalthough several members of the committee strongly favored it in the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nIODINE NUMBER--The iodine number adopted by the committee is that\r\ndetermined by the well-known Wijs method. This method was adopted after\r\ncareful comparison with the Hanus and Huebl methods. The Huebl method was\r\neliminated from consideration almost at the beginning of the committee's\r\nwork for the reason that the time required for complete absorption of\r\nthe iodine is unnecessarily long and, in fact, even after absorption has\r\ngone on over night, it is apparently not complete. In the case of the\r\nHanus and Wijs methods complete absorption takes place in from 15\r\nminutes to an hour, depending on conditions. Formerly, many chemists\r\nthought the Hanus solution rather easier to prepare than the Wijs\r\nsolution, but the experience of the committee was that the Wijs solution\r\nwas no more difficult to prepare than the Hanus. Furthermore, absorption\r\nof iodine from the Wijs solution appeared to take place with greater\r\npromptness and certainty than from the Hanus and was complete in a\r\nshorter time. Results by the Wijs method were also in better agreement\r\nin the case of oils showing high iodine absorption than with the Hanus\r\nsolution and showed a slightly higher iodine absorption for the same\r\nlength of time. However, the difference was not great. The committee\r\ninvestigated the question of substitution since it has been suggested\r\nthat in case of the Wijs solution substitution of iodine in the organic\r\nmolecule might occur, and found no evidence of this in the time required\r\nfor the determination, namely, 1/2 hr., or even for a somewhat longer\r\nperiod. One member of the committee felt that it was not desirable to\r\nintroduce the Wijs method into these standard methods since the Hanus\r\nmethod was already standardized by the Association of Official\r\nAgricultural Chemists, but the committee felt that it must follow the\r\nprinciple established at the commencement of its work, namely, that of\r\nadopting the method which appeared to be the best from all standpoints,\r\ntaking into consideration accuracy, convenience, simplicity, time,\r\nexpense, etc., without allowing precedent to have the deciding vote.\r\n\r\nIODINE NUMBER, TUNG OIL--The committee has made an extensive study of\r\nthe application of the Wijs method to the determination of iodine value\r\nin the case of tung oil with the result that it recommends the method\r\nfor this oil but has thought it desirable to limit the conditions under\r\nwhich the determination is conducted rather narrowly, although\r\nreasonably good results are obtained by the committee method without\r\nmaking use of the special limitations.\r\n\r\nThe co-operative work of the committee and the special investigations\r\nconducted by individual members bring out the following points:\r\n\r\n_Influence of Temperature_--From 16deg. C. to 30deg. C. there is a\r\nmoderate increase in the absorption, but above 30deg. the increase is\r\nrather rapid so that it was thought best to limit the temperature in the\r\ncase of tung oil to 20deg. to 25deg. C.\r\n\r\n_Influence of Time_--The absorption increases with the time but\r\napparently complete absorption, so far as unsaturated bonds are\r\nconcerned, occurs well within one hour's time. Consequently, one hour\r\nwas set as the practical limit.\r\n\r\n_Influence of Excess_--The excess of iodine solution also tends to\r\nincrease the iodine number, hence the Committee thought it necessary to\r\nlimit the excess rather rigidly to 55 +- 3 per cent, although with\r\ngreater latitude results were reasonably good.\r\n\r\n_Influence of Age of Solution_--Old solutions tend to give low results\r\nalthough up to 2 mo. no great differences were observed. Nevertheless,\r\nit was thought best to limit the age of the solution to 30 days--long\r\nenough for all practical purposes.\r\n\r\n_Amount of Sample_--As a practical amount of sample to be weighed out\r\nthe Committee decided on 0.15 g. with a tolerance of 0.05 g. in either\r\ndirection according to preference. In other words, the amount of sample\r\nto be taken for the determination to be from 0.1 to 0.2 g. in the\r\ndiscretion of the analyst.\r\n\r\nThe Committee's study of the Huebl method which has been adopted by the\r\nSociety for Testing Materials in the case of tung oil indicates that\r\nthis method when applied to tung oil is subject to the same influences\r\nas the Wijs method and it has the additional very serious disadvantage\r\nof requiring a long period of time for absorption which cannot be\r\nconsidered reasonable for a modern analytical method. When using the\r\nHuebl solution, the absorption is not complete in the case of tung oil at\r\n3, 7, 18 or even 24 hrs.\r\n\r\nThe Hanus method in the case of tung oil gives very high and erratic\r\nresults, as high as 180 to 240 in ordinary cases for an oil whose true\r\niodine number is about 165.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELTING POINT.\r\n\r\nA melting point is the temperature at which a solid substance assumes\r\nthe liquid condition. If the solid is a pure substance in the\r\ncrystalline condition the melting point is sharp and well defined for\r\nany given pressure. With increased pressure the melting point is lowered\r\nor raised, depending on whether the substance contracts or expands in\r\nmelting. The lowering or raising of the melting point with pressure is\r\nvery slight and ordinarily is not taken into consideration.\r\nMelting-point determinations are commonly carried out under ordinary\r\natmospheric pressures without correction. The general effect of soluble\r\nimpurities is to lower the melting point, and this holds true whether\r\nthe impurity has a higher or lower melting point than the pure substance\r\n(solvent). Thus if a small amount of stearic acid be added to liquid\r\npalmitic acid and the solution frozen, the melting point of this solid\r\nwill be lower than that of palmitic acid. Likewise the melting point of\r\nstearic acid is lowered by the addition of a small amount of palmitic\r\nacid. A eutectic mixture results when two components solidify\r\nsimultaneously at a definite temperature. Such a mixture has a constant\r\nmelting point and because of this and also because both solid and liquid\r\nphases have the same composition, eutectic mixtures were formerly looked\r\nupon as compounds. The phenomenon of double melting points has been\r\nobserved in the case of a number of glycerides. Such a glyceride when\r\nplaced in the usual capillary tube and subjected to increasing\r\ntemperature quickly resolidifies only to melt again and remain melted at\r\na still higher temperature. This phenomenon has not yet been\r\nsufficiently investigated to afford a satisfactory explanation.\r\n\r\nNon-crystalline substances such as glass, sealing wax and various other\r\nwaxes and wax mixtures, and most colloidal substances do not exhibit a\r\nsharp melting point, but under the application of heat first soften very\r\ngradually and at a considerably higher temperature melt sufficiently to\r\nflow. This phenomenon of melting through a long range of temperature may\r\nbe due to the amorphous nature of the substance or to the fact that it\r\nconsists of a very large number of components of many different melting\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThe fats and oils of natural origin, that is, the animal and vegetable\r\nfats and oils, consist of mixtures of glycerides and, generally\r\nspeaking, of a considerable number of such components. These components\r\nare crystalline and when separated in the pure state have definite\r\nmelting points, although some exhibit the phenomenon of double melting\r\npoint. For the most part the naturally occurring glycerides are mixed\r\nglycerides. In the natural fats and oils there are present also certain\r\nhigher alcohols, of which cholesterol is characteristic of the animal\r\nfats and oils and phytosterol of many of the vegetable fats and oils. In\r\naddition to the crystalline glycerides and the higher alcohols present\r\nin neutral fats, there are in fats of lower grade, fatty acids, which\r\nare crystalline, and also various non-crystalline impurities of an\r\nunsaponifiable nature, and the presence of these impurities tends to\r\nlower the melting point. They also tend to induce undercooling and when\r\nthe liquid fat or oil is being chilled for purposes of solidification or\r\nin determination of titer.\r\n\r\nThe presence of water, especially when this is thoroughly mixed or\r\nemulsified with a fat or oil, also influences the melting point to a\r\nmarked extent, causing the mixture to melt through a longer range of\r\ntemperatures than would be the case if the water were absent. This is\r\nparticularly true of emulsified fats and oils, such as butter and\r\noleomargarine, both of which contain, besides water, the solids\r\nnaturally present in milk or cream and including casein, milk sugar, and\r\nsalts. The melting-point method recommended by the Committee is not\r\napplicable to such emulsions or other watery mixtures and the Committee\r\nhas found it impossible to devise an accurate method for making\r\nsoftening-point or melting-point determinations on products of this\r\nnature. Not only the amount of water present but also the fineness of\r\nits particles, that is, its state of subdivision and distribution, in a\r\nfat or oil influences the softening point or melting point and causes it\r\nto vary widely in different samples.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the foregoing facts, natural fats and oils do not\r\nexhibit a definite melting point, composed as they are of mixtures of\r\nvarious crystalline glycerides, higher alcohols, fatty acids, and\r\nnon-crystalline substances. Therefore, the term melting point when\r\napplied to them requires further definition. They exhibit first a lower\r\nmelting point (the melting point of the lowest melting component) or\r\nwhat might be called the softening point and following this the fat\r\nsoftens through a shorter or longer range of temperature to the final\r\nmelting point at which temperature the fat is entirely liquid. This is\r\nthe melting point determined by the Committee's melting-point method.\r\nThe range between the softening point and the final melting point varies\r\ngreatly with the different fats and oils depending on their chemical\r\ncomponents, the water associated with them, emulsification, etc. In the\r\ncase of coconut oil the range between softening point and final melting\r\npoint is rather short; in the case of butter, long. Various methods have\r\nbeen devised to determine the so-called melting point of fats and oils.\r\nMost of these methods, however, determine, not the melting point, but\r\nthe softening point or the flow point of the fat and the great\r\ndifficulty has been in the past to devise a method which would determine\r\neven this point with reasonable accuracy and so that results could be\r\neasily duplicated. It has been the aim of the Committee to devise a\r\nsimple method for the determination of the melting point of fats and\r\noils, but it should be understood that the term melting point in the\r\nscientific sense is not applicable to natural fats and oils.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] Approved by the Supervisory Committee on Standard Methods of\r\nAnalysis of the American Chemical Society.\r\n\r\n[23] Live steam must not be turned into tank cars or coils before\r\nsamples are drawn, since there is no certain way of telling when coils\r\nare free from leaks.\r\n\r\n[24] If there is water present under the solid material this must be\r\nnoted and estimated separately.\r\n\r\n[25] Boiling point of water at reduced pressures.\r\n\r\n Pressure    Boiling Point   Boiling Point   Boiling Point\r\n  Mm.

C. The thermometer bulb should be close to the sample. The\r\ndefinition of constant weight is the same as for the Standard Method.\r\n\r\n[27] The following method is suggested by the Committee for routine\r\ncontrol work: Weigh out 5- to 25-g. portions of prepared sample into a\r\nglass or aluminum (_Caution_: Aluminum soap may be formed) beaker or\r\ncasserole and heat on a heavy asbestos board over burner or hot plate,\r\ntaking care that the temperature of the sample does not go above 130deg. C.\r\nat any time. During the heating rotate the vessel gently on the board by\r\nhand to avoid sputtering or too rapid evolution of moisture. The proper\r\nlength of time of heating is judged by absence of rising bubbles of\r\nsteam, by the absence of foam or by other signs known to the operator.\r\nAvoid overheating of sample as indicated by smoking or darkening. Cool\r\nin desiccator and weigh.\r\n\r\nBy co-operative work in several laboratories, the Committee has\r\ndemonstrated that this method can be used and satisfactory results\r\nobtained on coconut oil even when a considerable percentage of free\r\nfatty acids is present, and the method is recommended for this purpose.\r\nUnfortunately on account of the very great personal factor involved, the\r\nCommittee cannot establish this method as a preferred method.\r\nNevertheless, after an operator has learned the technique of the method,\r\nit gives perfectly satisfactory results for ordinary oils and fats,\r\nbutter, oleomargarine and coconut oil, and deserves more recognition\r\nthan it has heretofore received.\r\n\r\n[28] For routine control work, filter paper is sometimes more convenient\r\nthan the prepared Gooch crucible, but must be very carefully washed,\r\nespecially around the rim, to remove the last traces of fat.\r\n\r\n[29] For routine work, an ash may be run on the original fat, and the\r\nsoluble mineral matter obtained by deducting the ash on the insoluble\r\nimpurities from this. In this case the Gooch crucible should be prepared\r\nwith an ignited asbestos mat so that the impurities may be ashed\r\ndirectly after being weighed. In all cases ignition should be to\r\nconstant weight so as to insure complete decomposition of carbonates.\r\n\r\n[30] See note on Soluble Mineral Matter following these methods. When\r\nthe ash contains phosphates the factor 10 cannot be applied, but the\r\nbases consisting of calcium oxide, etc., must be determined, and the\r\nfactor 10 applied to them.\r\n\r\n[31] For routine work methyl or denatured ethyl alcohol of approximately\r\n95 per cent strength may be used. With these reagents the end-point is\r\nnot sharp.\r\n\r\n[32] P. C. McIlhiney, _J. Am. Chem. Soc._, 29 (1917), 1222, gives the\r\nfollowing details for the preparation of the iodine monochloride\r\nsolution:\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the iodine monochloride solution presents no great\r\ndifficulty, but it must be done with care and accuracy in order to\r\nobtain satisfactory results. There must be in the solution no sensible\r\nexcess either of iodine or more particularly of chlorine, over that\r\nrequired to form the monochloride. This condition is most satisfactorily\r\nattained by dissolving in the whole of the acetic acid to be used the\r\nrequisite quantity of iodine, using a gentle heat to assist the\r\nsolution, if it is found necessary, setting aside a small portion of\r\nthis solution, while pure and dry chlorine is passed into the remainder\r\nuntil the halogen content of the whole solution is doubled. Ordinarily\r\nit will be found that by passing the chlorine into the main part of the\r\nsolution until the characteristic color of free iodine has just been\r\ndischarged there will be a slight excess of chlorine which is corrected\r\nby the addition of the requisite amount of the unchlorinated portion\r\nuntil all free chlorine has been destroyed. A slight excess of iodine\r\ndoes little or no harm, but excess of chlorine must be avoided.\r\n\r\n[33] The melting point of oils may be determined in general according to\r\nthe above procedure, taking into consideration the lower temperature\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT AND MACHINERY\r\n\r\nIllustrations of machinery and layouts of the plant of a modern\r\nsoap-making establishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOIST, LYE TANK, ETC.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MELTING-OUT TROUGH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAUNDRY SOAP PLANT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING RACK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOAP KETTLE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMELTER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRUTCHER (Cross Section)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORIZONTAL CRUTCHER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRUTCHER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WRAPPING MACHINE (LAUNDRY SOAP)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLABBER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUTTING TABLE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTOMATIC POWER CUTTING TABLE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTOMATIC PRESS (LAUNDRY)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUTTING TABLE (HAND)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARTON WRAPPING MACHINE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING RACKS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOAP POWDER BOX]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCOURING SOAP PRESS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRAME]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOAP POWDER EQUIPMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLUFFY SOAP POWDER EQUIPMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOAP POWDER MIXER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOAP POWDER MILL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOILET SOAP EQUIPMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOILET SOAP DRYER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILLING BOX]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMALGAMATOR]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOILET SOAP MILL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOILET SOAP MILL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHIPPER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLODDER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORIZONTAL CHIPPER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMALGAMATOR (IMPROVED)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRESS (LETTERING ON 4 SIDES OF CAKE)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Press (Foot)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Press (Foot)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLODDER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTOMATIC PRESS (TOILET)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MULTIPLE CAKE CUTTER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAKE CUTTER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHIPPER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLYCERINE DISTILLING PLANT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRUDE GLYCERINE PLANT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H-A FATTY ACID DISTILLING PLANT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n\r\nTables marked * are taken from the German Year Book for Soap Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n(U.
