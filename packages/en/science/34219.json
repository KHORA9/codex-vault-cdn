Of course, Jerry's\r\nname was Gerald, and not Jeremiah, whatever you may think; and Jimmy's\r\nname was James; and Kathleen was never called by her name at all, but\r\nCathy, or Catty, or Puss Cat, when her brothers were pleased with her,\r\nand Scratch Cat when they were not pleased. And they were at school in a\r\nlittle town in the West of England--the boys at one school, of course,\r\nand the girl at another, because the sensible habit of having boys and\r\ngirls at the same school is not yet as common as I hope it will be some\r\nday. They used to see each other on Saturdays and Sundays at the house\r\nof a kind maiden lady; but it was one of those houses where it is\r\nimpossible to play. You know the kind of house, don't you? There is a\r\nsort of a something about that kind of house that makes you hardly able\r\neven to talk to each other when you are left alone, and playing seems\r\nunnatural and affected. So they looked forward to the holidays, when\r\nthey should all go home and be together all day long, in a house where\r\nplaying was natural and conversation possible, and where the Hampshire\r\nforests and fields were full of interesting things to do and see. Their\r\nCousin Betty was to be there too, and there were plans. Betty's school\r\nbroke up before theirs, and so she got to the Hampshire home first, and\r\nthe moment she got there she began to have measles, so that my three\r\ncouldn't go home at all. You may imagine their feelings. The thought of\r\nseven weeks at Miss Hervey's was not to be borne, and all three wrote\r\nhome and said so. This astonished their parents very much, because they\r\nhad always thought it was so nice for the children to have dear Miss\r\nHervey's to go to. However, they were \"jolly decent about it,\" as Jerry\r\nsaid, and after a lot of letters and telegrams, it was arranged that the\r\nboys should go and stay at Kathleen's school, where there were now no\r\ngirls left and no mistresses except the French one.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be better than being at Miss Hervey's,\" said Kathleen, when the\r\nboys came round to ask Mademoiselle when it would be convenient for them\r\nto come; \"and, besides, our school's not half so ugly as yours. We do\r\nhave tablecloths on the tables and curtains at the windows, and yours is\r\nall deal boards, and desks, and inkiness.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone to pack their boxes Kathleen made all the rooms as\r\npretty as she could with flowers in jam jars, marigolds chiefly,\r\nbecause there was nothing much else in the back garden. There were\r\ngeraniums in the front garden, and calceolarias and lobelias; of course,\r\nthe children were not allowed to pick these.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to have some sort of play to keep us going through the\r\nholidays,\" said Kathleen, when tea was over, and she had unpacked and\r\narranged the boys' clothes in the painted chests of drawers, feeling\r\nvery grown-up and careful as she neatly laid the different sorts of\r\nclothes in tidy little heaps in the drawers. \"Suppose we write a book.\"\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean me, of course,\" said Kathleen, a little injured; \"I meant\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too much fag,\" said Gerald briefly.\r\n\r\n\"If we wrote a book,\" Kathleen persisted, \"about what the insides of\r\nschools really _are_ like, people would read it and say how clever we\r\nwere.\"\r\n\r\n\"More likely expel us,\" said Gerald. \"No; we'll have an out-of-doors\r\ngame--bandits, or something like that. It wouldn't be bad if we could\r\nget a cave and keep stores in it, and have our meals there.\"\r\n\r\n\"There aren't any caves,\" said Jimmy, who was fond of contradicting\r\nevery one. \"And, besides, your precious Mamselle won't let us go out\r\nalone, as likely as not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we'll see about that,\" said Gerald. \"I'll go and talk to her like a\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like that?\" Kathleen pointed the thumb of scorn at him, and he looked\r\nin the glass.\r\n\r\n\"To brush his hair and his clothes and to wash his face and hands was to\r\nour hero but the work of a moment,\" said Gerald, and went to suit the\r\naction to the word.\r\n\r\nIt was a very sleek boy, brown and thin and interesting-looking, that\r\nknocked at the door of the parlour where Mademoiselle sat reading a\r\nyellow-covered book and wishing vain wishes. Gerald could always make\r\nhimself look interesting at a moment's notice, a very useful\r\naccomplishment in dealing with strange grown-ups. It was done by opening\r\nhis grey eyes rather wide, allowing the corners of his mouth to droop,\r\nand assuming a gentle, pleading expression, resembling that of the late\r\nlittle Lord Fauntleroy--who must, by the way, be quite old now, and an\r\nawful prig.\r\n\r\n\"Entrez!\" said Mademoiselle, in shrill French accents. So he entered.\r\n\r\n\"Eh bien?\" she said rather impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"I hope I am not disturbing you,\" said Gerald, in whose mouth, it\r\nseemed, butter would not have melted.\r\n\r\n\"But no,\" she said, somewhat softened. \"What is it that you desire?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I ought to come and say how do you do,\" said Gerald, \"because\r\nof you being the lady of the house.\"\r\n\r\nHe held out the newly-washed hand, still damp and red. She took it.\r\n\r\n\"You are a very polite little boy,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Gerald, more polite than ever. \"I am so sorry for\r\nyou. It must be dreadful to have us to look after in the holidays.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not at all,\" said Mademoiselle in her turn. \"I am sure you will be\r\nvery good childrens.\"\r\n\r\nGerald's look assured her that he and the others would be as near angels\r\nas children could be without ceasing to be human.\r\n\r\n\"We'll try,\" he said earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Can one do anything for you?\" asked the French governess kindly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, thank you,\" said Gerald. \"We don't want to give you any trouble\r\nat all. And I was thinking it would be less trouble for you if we were\r\nto go out into the woods all day to-morrow and take our dinner with\r\nus--something cold, you know--so as not to be a trouble to the cook.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very considerate,\" said Mademoiselle coldly. Then Gerald's eyes\r\nsmiled; they had a trick of doing this when his lips were quite serious.\r\nMademoiselle caught the twinkle, and she laughed and Gerald laughed too.\r\n\r\n\"Little deceiver!\" she said. \"Why not say at once you want to be free of\r\n_surveillance_, how you say--overwatching--without pretending it is me\r\nyou wish to please?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have to be careful with grown-ups,\" said Gerald, \"but it isn't all\r\npretence either. We _don't_ want to trouble you--and we don't want you\r\nto----\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"LITTLE DECEIVER!\" SHE SAID.]\r\n\r\n\"To trouble you. Eh bien! Your parents, they permit these days at\r\nwoods?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Gerald truthfully.\r\n\r\n\"Then I will not be more a dragon than the parents. I will forewarn the\r\ncook. Are you content?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather!\" said Gerald. \"Mademoiselle, you are a dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"A deer?\" she repeated--\"a stag?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, a--a _cherie_,\" said Gerald--\"a regular A1 _cherie_. And you shan't\r\nrepent it. Is there anything we can do for you--wind your wool, or find\r\nyour spectacles, or----?\"\r\n\r\n\"He thinks me a grandmother!\" said Mademoiselle, laughing more than\r\never. \"Go then, and be not more naughty than you must.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Well, what luck?\" the others asked.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right,\" said Gerald indifferently. \"I told you it would be.\r\nThe ingenuous youth won the regard of the foreign governess, who in her\r\nyouth had been the beauty of her humble village.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe she ever was. She's too stern,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Gerald, \"that's only because you don't know how to manage\r\nher. She wasn't stern with _me_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, what a humbug you are though, aren't you?\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm a dip--what's-its-name? Something like an ambassador.\r\nDipsoplomatist--that's what I am. Anyhow, we've got our day, and if we\r\ndon't find a cave in it my name's not Jack Robinson.\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle, less stern than Kathleen had ever seen her, presided at\r\nsupper, which was bread and treacle spread several hours before, and now\r\nharder and drier than any other food you can think of. Gerald was very\r\npolite in handing her butter and cheese, and pressing her to taste the\r\nbread and treacle.\r\n\r\n\"Bah! it is like sand in the mouth--of a dryness! Is it possible this\r\npleases you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Gerald, \"it is not possible, but it is not polite for boys to\r\nmake remarks about their food!\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed, but there was no more dried bread and treacle for supper\r\nafter that.\r\n\r\n\"How _do_ you do it?\" Kathleen whispered admiringly as they said\r\ngood-night.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's quite easy when you've once got a grown-up to see what you're\r\nafter. You'll see, I shall drive her with a rein of darning cotton after\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning Gerald got up early and gathered a little bunch of pink\r\ncarnations from a plant which he found hidden among the marigolds. He\r\ntied it up with black cotton and laid it on Mademoiselle's plate. She\r\nsmiled and looked quite handsome as she stuck the flowers in her belt.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it's quite decent,\" Jimmy asked later--\"sort of bribing\r\npeople to let you do as you like with flowers and things and passing\r\nthem the salt?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not that,\" said Kathleen suddenly. \"_I_ know what Gerald means,\r\nonly I never think of the things in time myself. You see, if you want\r\ngrown-ups to be nice to you the least you can do is to be nice to them\r\nand think of little things to please them. I never think of any myself.\r\nJerry does; that's why all the old ladies like him. It's not bribery.\r\nIt's a sort of honesty--like paying for things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyway,\" said Jimmy, putting away the moral question, \"we've got\r\na ripping day for the woods.\"\r\n\r\nThey had.\r\n\r\nThe wide High Street, even at the busy morning hour almost as quiet as a\r\ndream-street, lay bathed in sunshine; the leaves shone fresh from last\r\nnight's rain, but the road was dry, and in the sunshine the very dust of\r\nit sparkled like diamonds. The beautiful old houses, standing stout and\r\nstrong, looked as though they were basking in the sunshine and enjoying\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"But _are_ there any woods?\" asked Kathleen as they passed the\r\nmarket-place.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't much matter about woods,\" said Gerald dreamily, \"we're sure\r\nto find _something_. One of the chaps told me his father said when he\r\nwas a boy there used to be a little cave under the bank in a lane near\r\nthe Salisbury Road; but he said there was an enchanted castle there too,\r\nso perhaps the cave isn't true either.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we were to get horns,\" said Kathleen, \"and to blow them very hard\r\nall the way, we might find a magic castle.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you've got the money to throw away on horns ...\" said Jimmy\r\ncontemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have, as it happens, so there!\" said Kathleen. And the horns\r\nwere bought in a tiny shop with a bulging window full of a tangle of\r\ntoys and sweets and cucumbers and sour apples.\r\n\r\nAnd the quiet square at the end of the town where the church is, and the\r\nhouses of the most respectable people, echoed to the sound of horns\r\nblown long and loud. But none of the houses turned into enchanted\r\ncastles.\r\n\r\nSo they went along the Salisbury Road, which was very hot and dusty, so\r\nthey agreed to drink one of the bottles of gingerbeer.\r\n\r\n\"We might as well carry the gingerbeer inside us as inside the bottle,\"\r\nsaid Jimmy, \"and we can hide the bottle and call for it as we come\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\nPresently they came to a place where the road, as Gerald said, went two\r\nways at once.\r\n\r\n\"_That_ looks like adventures,\" said Kathleen; and they took the\r\nright-hand road, and the next time they took a turning it was a\r\nleft-hand one, so as to be quite fair, Jimmy said, and then a right-hand\r\none and then a left, and so on, till they were completely lost.\r\n\r\n\"_Com_pletely,\" said Kathleen; \"how jolly!\"\r\n\r\nAnd now trees arched overhead, and the banks of the road were high and\r\nbushy. The adventurers had long since ceased to blow their horns. It\r\nwas too tiring to go on doing that, when there was no one to be annoyed\r\nby it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, kriky!\" observed Jimmy suddenly, \"let's sit down a bit and have\r\nsome of our dinner. We might call it lunch, you know,\" he added\r\npersuasively.\r\n\r\nSo they sat down in the hedge and ate the ripe red gooseberries that\r\nwere to have been their dessert.\r\n\r\nAnd as they sat and rested and wished that their boots did not feel so\r\nfull of feet, Gerald leaned back against the bushes, and the bushes gave\r\nway so that he almost fell over backward. Something had yielded to the\r\npressure of his back, and there was the sound of something heavy that\r\nfell.\r\n\r\n\"O Jimminy!\" he remarked, recovering himself suddenly; \"there's\r\nsomething hollow in there--the stone I was leaning against simply\r\n_went_!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish it was a cave,\" said Jimmy; \"but of course it isn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we blow the horns perhaps it will be,\" said Kathleen, and hastily\r\nblew her own.\r\n\r\nGerald reached his hand through the bushes. \"I can't feel anything but\r\nair,\" he said; \"it's just a hole full of emptiness.\" The other two\r\npulled back the bushes. There certainly was a hole in the bank. \"I'm\r\ngoing to go in,\" observed Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't!\" said his sister. \"I wish you wouldn't. Suppose there were\r\nsnakes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not likely,\" said Gerald, but he leaned forward and struck a match.\r\n\"It _is_ a cave!\" he cried, and put his knee on the mossy stone he had\r\nbeen sitting on, scrambled over it, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nA breathless pause followed.\r\n\r\n\"You all right?\" asked Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; come on. You'd better come feet first--there's a bit of a drop.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go next,\" said Kathleen, and went--feet first, as advised. The\r\nfeet waved wildly in the air.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" said Gerald in the dark; \"you'll have my eye out. Put your\r\nfeet _down_, girl, not up. It's no use trying to fly here--there's no\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\nHe helped her by pulling her feet forcibly down and then lifting her\r\nunder the arms. She felt rustling dry leaves under her boots, and stood\r\nready to receive Jimmy, who came in head first, like one diving into an\r\nunknown sea.\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ a cave,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"The young explorers,\" explained Gerald, blocking up the hole of\r\nentrance with his shoulders, \"dazzled at first by the darkness of the\r\ncave, could see nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Darkness doesn't dazzle,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we'd got a candle,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it does,\" Gerald contradicted--\"could see nothing. But their\r\ndauntless leader, whose eyes had grown used to the dark while the clumsy\r\nforms of the others were bunging up the entrance, had made a\r\ndiscovery.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JIMMY CAME IN HEAD FIRST, LIKE ONE DIVING INTO AN UNKNOWN\r\nSEA.]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what!\" Both the others were used to Gerald's way of telling a story\r\nwhile he acted it, but they did sometimes wish that he didn't talk quite\r\nso long and so like a book in moments of excitement.\r\n\r\n\"He did not reveal the dread secret to his faithful followers till one\r\nand all had given him their word of honour to be calm.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll be calm all right,\" said Jimmy impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Gerald, ceasing suddenly to be a book and becoming a\r\nboy, \"there's a light over there--look behind you!\"\r\n\r\nThey looked. And there was. A faint greyness on the brown walls of the\r\ncave, and a brighter greyness cut off sharply by a dark line, showed\r\nthat round a turning or angle of the cave there was daylight.\r\n\r\n\"Attention!\" said Gerald; at least, that was what he meant, though what\r\nhe said was \"'Shun!\" as becomes the son of a soldier. The others\r\nmechanically obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"You will remain at attention till I give the word 'Slow march!' on\r\nwhich you will advance cautiously in open order, following your hero\r\nleader, taking care not to tread on the dead and wounded.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you wouldn't!\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"There aren't any,\" said Jimmy, feeling for her hand in the dark; \"he\r\nonly means, take care not to tumble over stones and things.\"\r\n\r\nHere he found her hand, and she screamed.\r\n\r\n\"It's only me,\" said Jimmy. \"I thought you'd like me to hold it. But\r\nyou're just like a girl.\"\r\n\r\nTheir eyes had now begun to get accustomed to the darkness, and all\r\ncould see that they were in a rough stone cave, that went straight on\r\nfor about three or four yards and then turned sharply to the right.\r\n\r\n\"Death or victory!\" remarked Gerald. \"Now, then--Slow march!\"\r\n\r\nHe advanced carefully, picking his way among the loose earth and stones\r\nthat were the floor of the cave. \"A sail, a sail!\" he cried, as he\r\nturned the corner.\r\n\r\n\"How splendid!\" Kathleen drew a long breath as she came out into the\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see any sail,\" said Jimmy, following.\r\n\r\nThe narrow passage ended in a round arch all fringed with ferns and\r\ncreepers. They passed through the arch into a deep, narrow gully whose\r\nbanks were of stones, moss-covered; and in the crannies grew more ferns\r\nand long grasses. Trees growing on the top of the bank arched across,\r\nand the sunlight came through in changing patches of brightness, turning\r\nthe gully to a roofed corridor of goldy-green. The path, which was of\r\ngreeny-grey flagstones where heaps of leaves had drifted, sloped steeply\r\ndown, and at the end of it was another round arch, quite dark inside,\r\nabove which rose rocks and grass and bushes.\r\n\r\n\"It's like the outside of a railway tunnel,\" said James.\r\n\r\n\"It's the entrance to the enchanted castle,\" said Kathleen. \"Let's blow\r\nthe horns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dry up!\" said Gerald. \"The bold Captain, reproving the silly chatter of\r\nhis subordinates----\"\r\n\r\n\"I like that!\" said Jimmy, indignant.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you would,\" resumed Gerald--\"of his subordinates, bade them\r\nadvance with caution and in silence, because after all there might be\r\nsomebody about, and the other arch might be an ice-house or something\r\ndangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked Kathleen anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Bears, perhaps,\" said Gerald briefly.\r\n\r\n\"There aren't any bears without bars--in England, anyway,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\"They call bears bars in America,\" he added absently.\r\n\r\n\"Quick march!\" was Gerald's only reply.\r\n\r\nAnd they marched. Under the drifted damp leaves the path was firm and\r\nstony to their shuffling feet. At the dark arch they stopped.\r\n\r\n\"There are steps down,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ an ice-house,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let's,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Our hero,\" said Gerald, \"who nothing could dismay, raised the faltering\r\nhopes of his abject minions by saying that he was jolly well going on,\r\nand they could do as they liked about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you call names,\" said Jimmy, \"you can go on by yourself.\" He added,\r\n\"So there!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"IT'S THE ENTRANCE TO THE ENCHANTED CASTLE,\" SAID\r\nKATHLEEN.]\r\n\r\n\"It's part of the game, silly,\" explained Gerald kindly. \"You can be\r\nCaptain to-morrow, so you'd better hold your jaw now, and begin to\r\nthink about what names you'll call us when it's your turn.\"\r\n\r\nVery slowly and carefully they went down the steps. A vaulted stone\r\narched over their heads. Gerald struck a match when the last step was\r\nfound to have no edge, and to be, in fact, the beginning of a passage,\r\nturning to the left.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said Jimmy, \"will take us back into the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or under it,\" said Gerald. \"We've come down eleven steps.\"\r\n\r\nThey went on, following their leader, who went very slowly for fear, as\r\nhe explained, of steps. The passage was very dark.\r\n\r\n\"I don't half like it!\" whispered Jimmy.\r\n\r\nThen came a glimmer of daylight that grew and grew, and presently ended\r\nin another arch that looked out over a scene so like a picture out of a\r\nbook about Italy that every one's breath was taken away, and they simply\r\nwalked forward silent and staring. A short avenue of cypresses led,\r\nwidening as it went, to a marble terrace that lay broad and white in the\r\nsunlight. The children, blinking, leaned their arms on the broad, flat\r\nbalustrade and gazed. Immediately below them was a lake--just like a\r\nlake in \"The Beauties of Italy\"--a lake with swans and an island and\r\nweeping willows; beyond it were green slopes dotted with groves of\r\ntrees, and amid the trees gleamed the white limbs of statues. Against a\r\nlittle hill to the left was a round white building with pillars, and to\r\nthe right a waterfall came tumbling down among mossy stones to splash\r\ninto the lake. Steps led from the terrace to the water, and other steps\r\nto the green lawns beside it. Away across the grassy slopes deer were\r\nfeeding, and in the distance where the groves of trees thickened into\r\nwhat looked almost a forest were enormous shapes of grey stone, like\r\nnothing that the children had ever seen before.\r\n\r\n\"That chap at school----\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ an enchanted castle,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see any castle,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"What do you call that, then?\" Gerald pointed to where, beyond a belt of\r\nlime-trees, white towers and turrets broke the blue of the sky.\r\n\r\n\"There doesn't seem to be any one about,\" said Kathleen, \"and yet it's\r\nall so tidy. I believe it is magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Magic mowing machines,\" Jimmy suggested.\r\n\r\n\"If we were in a book it would be an enchanted castle--certain to be,\"\r\nsaid Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ an enchanted castle,\" said Gerald in hollow tones.\r\n\r\n\"But there aren't any.\" Jimmy was quite positive.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know? Do you think there's nothing in the world but what\r\n_you've_ seen?\" His scorn was crushing.\r\n\r\n\"I think magic went out when people began to have steam-engines,\" Jimmy\r\ninsisted, \"and newspapers, and telephones and wireless telegraphing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wireless is rather like magic when you come to think of it,\" said\r\nGerald.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _that_ sort!\" Jimmy's contempt was deep.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps there's given up being magic because people didn't believe in\r\nit any more,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't let's spoil the show with any silly old not believing,\"\r\nsaid Gerald with decision. \"I'm going to believe in magic as hard as I\r\ncan. This is an enchanted garden, and that's an enchanted castle, and\r\nI'm jolly well going to explore. The dauntless knight then led the way,\r\nleaving his ignorant squires to follow or not, just as they jolly well\r\nchose.\" He rolled off the balustrade and strode firmly down towards the\r\nlawn, his boots making, as they went, a clatter full of determination.\r\n\r\nThe others followed. There never was such a garden--out of a picture or\r\na fairy tale. They passed quite close by the deer, who only raised their\r\npretty heads to look, and did not seem startled at all. And after a long\r\nstretch of turf they passed under the heaped-up heavy masses of\r\nlime-trees and came into a rose-garden, bordered with thick, close-cut\r\nyew hedges, and lying red and pink and green and white in the sun, like\r\na giant's many-coloured, highly-scented pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"I know we shall meet a gardener in a minute, and he'll ask what we're\r\ndoing here. And then what will you say?\" Kathleen asked with her nose in\r\na rose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THIS IS AN ENCHANTED GARDEN AND THAT'S AN ENCHANTED\r\nCASTLE.\"]\r\n\r\n\"I shall say we've lost our way, and it will be quite true,\" said\r\nGerald.\r\n\r\nBut they did not meet a gardener or anybody else, and the feeling of\r\nmagic got thicker and thicker, till they were almost afraid of the sound\r\nof their feet in the great silent place. Beyond the rose garden was a\r\nyew hedge with an arch cut in it, and it was the beginning of a maze\r\nlike the one in Hampton Court.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Gerald, \"you mark my words. In the middle of this maze we\r\nshall find the secret enchantment. Draw your swords, my merry men all,\r\nand hark forward tallyho in the utmost silence.\"\r\n\r\nWhich they did.\r\n\r\nIt was very hot in the maze, between the close yew hedges, and the way\r\nto the maze's heart was hidden well. Again and again they found\r\nthemselves at the black yew arch that opened on the rose garden, and\r\nthey were all glad that they had brought large, clean pocket-handkerchiefs\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nIt was when they found themselves there for the fourth time that Jimmy\r\nsuddenly cried, \"Oh, I wish----\" and then stopped short very suddenly.\r\n\"Oh!\" he added in quite a different voice, \"where's the dinner?\" And\r\nthen in a stricken silence they all remembered that the basket with the\r\ndinner had been left at the entrance of the cave. Their thoughts dwelt\r\nfondly on the slices of cold mutton, the six tomatoes, the bread and\r\nbutter, the screwed-up paper of salt, the apple turnovers, and the\r\nlittle thick glass that one drank the gingerbeer out of.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go back,\" said Jimmy, \"now this minute, and get our things and\r\nhave our dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's have one more try at the maze. I hate giving things up,\" said\r\nGerald.\r\n\r\n\"I _am_ so hungry!\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you say so before?\" asked Gerald bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you can't be now. You don't get hungry all in a minute. What's\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"That\" was a gleam of red that lay at the foot of the yew hedge--a thin\r\nlittle line, that you would hardly have noticed unless you had been\r\nstaring in a fixed and angry way at the roots of the hedge.\r\n\r\nIt was a thread of cotton. Gerald picked it up. One end of it was tied\r\nto a thimble with holes in it, and the other----\r\n\r\n\"There _is_ no other end,\" said Gerald, with firm triumph. \"It's a\r\nclue--that's what it is. What price cold mutton now? I've always felt\r\nsomething magic would happen some day, and now it has.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect the gardener put it there,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"With a Princess's silver thimble on it? Look! there's a crown on the\r\nthimble.\"\r\n\r\nThere was.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said Gerald in low, urgent tones, \"if you are adventurers _be_\r\nadventurers; and anyhow, I expect some one has gone along the road and\r\nbagged the mutton hours ago.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked forward, winding the red thread round his fingers as he went.\r\nAnd it _was_ a clue, and it led them right into the middle of the maze.\r\nAnd in the very middle of the maze they came upon the wonder.\r\n\r\nThe red clue led them up two stone steps to a round grass plot. There\r\nwas a sun-dial in the middle, and all round against the yew hedge a low,\r\nwide marble seat. The red clue ran straight across the grass and by the\r\nsun-dial, and ended in a small brown hand with jewelled rings on every\r\nfinger. The hand was, naturally, attached to an arm, and that had many\r\nbracelets on it, sparkling with red and blue and green stones. The arm\r\nwore a sleeve of pink and gold brocaded silk, faded a little here and\r\nthere but still extremely imposing, and the sleeve was part of a dress,\r\nwhich was worn by a lady who lay on the stone seat asleep in the sun.\r\nThe rosy gold dress fell open over an embroidered petticoat of a soft\r\ngreen colour. There was old yellow lace the colour of scalded cream, and\r\na thin white veil spangled with silver stars covered the face.\r\n\r\n\"It's the enchanted Princess,\" said Gerald, now really impressed. \"I\r\ntold you so.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the Sleeping Beauty,\" said Kathleen. \"It is--look how\r\nold-fashioned her clothes are, like the pictures of Marie Antoinette's\r\nladies in the history book. She has slept for a hundred years. Oh,\r\nGerald, you're the eldest; you must be the Prince, and we never knew\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RED CLUE RAN STRAIGHT ACROSS THE GRASS AND BY THE\r\nSUN-DIAL, AND ENDED IN A SMALL BROWN HAND.]\r\n\r\n\"She isn't really a Princess,\" said Jimmy. But the others laughed at\r\nhim, partly because his saying things like that was enough to spoil any\r\ngame, and partly because they really were not at all sure that it was\r\nnot a Princess who lay there as still as the sunshine. Every stage of\r\nthe adventure--the cave, the wonderful gardens, the maze, the clue, had\r\ndeepened the feeling of magic, till now Kathleen and Gerald were almost\r\ncompletely bewitched.\r\n\r\n\"Lift the veil up, Jerry,\" said Kathleen in a whisper; \"if she isn't\r\nbeautiful we shall know she can't be the Princess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lift it yourself,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"I expect you're forbidden to touch the figures,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"It's not wax, silly,\" said his brother.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his sister, \"wax wouldn't be much good in this sun. And,\r\nbesides, you can see her breathing. It's the Princess right enough.\" She\r\nvery gently lifted the edge of the veil and turned it back. The\r\nPrincess's face was small and white between long plaits of black hair.\r\nHer nose was straight and her brows finely traced. There were a few\r\nfreckles on cheek-bones and nose.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder,\" whispered Kathleen, \"sleeping all these years in all this\r\nsun!\" Her mouth was not a rosebud. But all the same--\r\n\r\n\"Isn't she lovely!\" Kathleen murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Not so dusty,\" Gerald was understood to reply.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Jerry,\" said Kathleen firmly, \"you're the eldest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am,\" said Gerald uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've got to wake the Princess.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's not a Princess,\" said Jimmy, with his hands in the pockets of his\r\nknickerbockers; \"she's only a little girl dressed up.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she's in long dresses,\" urged Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but look what a little way down her frock her feet come. She\r\nwouldn't be any taller than Jerry if she was to stand up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now then,\" urged Kathleen. \"Jerry, don't be silly. You've got to do\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do what?\" asked Gerald, kicking his left boot with his right.\r\n\r\n\"Why, kiss her awake, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not me!\" was Gerald's unhesitating rejoinder.\r\n\r\n\"Well, some one's got to.\"\r\n\r\n\"She'd go for me as likely as not the minute she woke up,\" said Gerald\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I'd do it like a shot,\" said Kathleen, \"but I don't suppose it ud make\r\nany difference me kissing her.\"\r\n\r\nShe did it; and it didn't. The Princess still lay in deep slumber.\r\n\r\n\"Then you must, Jimmy. I daresay you'll do. Jump back quickly before she\r\ncan hit you.\"\r\n\r\n\"She won't hit him, he's such a little chap,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Little yourself!\" said Jimmy. \"_I_ don't mind kissing her. I'm not a\r\ncoward, like Some People. Only if I do, I'm going to be the dauntless\r\nleader for the rest of the day.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THREE STOOD BREATHLESS, AWAITING THE RESULT.]\r\n\r\n\"No, look here--hold on!\" cried Gerald, \"perhaps I'd better----\" But,\r\nin the meantime, Jimmy had planted a loud, cheerful-sounding kiss on the\r\nPrincess's pale cheek, and now the three stood breathless, awaiting the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nAnd the result was that the Princess opened large, dark eyes, stretched\r\nout her arms, yawned a little, covering her mouth with a small brown\r\nhand, and said, quite plainly and distinctly, and without any room at\r\nall for mistake:--\r\n\r\n\"Then the hundred years are over? How the yew hedges have grown! Which\r\nof you is my Prince that aroused me from my deep sleep of so many long\r\nyears?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" said Jimmy fearlessly, for she did not look as though she were\r\ngoing to slap any one.\r\n\r\n\"My noble preserver!\" said the Princess, and held out her hand. Jimmy\r\nshook it vigorously.\r\n\r\n\"But I say,\" said he, \"you aren't really a Princess, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am,\" she answered; \"who else could I be? Look at my crown!\"\r\nShe pulled aside the spangled veil, and showed beneath it a coronet of\r\nwhat even Jimmy could not help seeing to be diamonds.\r\n\r\n\"But----\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" she said, opening her eyes very wide, \"you must have known about\r\nmy being here, or you'd never have come. How _did_ you get past the\r\ndragons?\"\r\n\r\nGerald ignored the question. \"I say,\" he said, \"do you really believe in\r\nmagic, and all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ought to,\" she said, \"if anybody does. Look, here's the place where I\r\npricked my finger with the spindle.\" She showed a little scar on her\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\n\"Then this really _is_ an enchanted castle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is,\" said the Princess. \"How stupid you are!\" She stood\r\nup, and her pink brocaded dress lay in bright waves about her feet.\r\n\r\n\"I said her dress would be too long,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"It was the right length when I went to sleep,\" said the Princess; \"it\r\nmust have grown in the hundred years.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe you're a Princess at all,\" said Jimmy; \"at least----\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother about believing it, if you don't like,\" said the Princess.\r\n\"It doesn't so much matter what you believe as what I am.\" She turned to\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go back to the castle,\" she said, \"and I'll show you all my\r\nlovely jewels and things. Wouldn't you like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Gerald with very plain hesitation. \"But----\"\r\n\r\n\"But what?\" The Princess's tone was impatient.\r\n\r\n\"But we're most awfully hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, so am I!\" cried the Princess.\r\n\r\n\"We've had nothing to eat since breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it's three now,\" said the Princess, looking at the sun-dial. \"Why,\r\nyou've had nothing to eat for hours and hours and hours. But think of\r\nme! I haven't had anything to eat for a hundred years. Come along to the\r\ncastle.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mice will have eaten everything,\" said Jimmy sadly. He saw now that\r\nshe really _was_ a Princess.\r\n\r\n\"Not they,\" cried the Princess joyously. \"You forget everything's\r\nenchanted here. Time simply stood still for a hundred years. Come along,\r\nand one of you must carry my train, or I shan't be able to move now it's\r\ngrown such a frightful length.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN you are young so many things are difficult to believe, and yet the\r\ndullest people will tell you that they are true--such things, for\r\ninstance, as that the earth goes round the sun, and that it is not flat\r\nbut round. But the things that seem really likely, like fairy-tales and\r\nmagic, are, so say the grown-ups, not true at all. Yet they are so easy\r\nto believe, especially when you see them happening. And, as I am always\r\ntelling you, the most wonderful things happen to all sorts of people,\r\nonly you never hear about them because the people think that no one will\r\nbelieve their stories, and so they don't tell them to any one except me.\r\nAnd they tell me, because they know that I can believe anything.\r\n\r\nWhen Jimmy had awakened the Sleeping Princess, and she had invited the\r\nthree children to go with her to her palace and get something to eat,\r\nthey all knew quite surely that they had come into a place of magic\r\nhappenings. And they walked in a slow procession along the grass towards\r\nthe castle. The Princess went first, and Kathleen carried her shining\r\ntrain; then came Jimmy, and Gerald came last. They were all quite sure\r\nthat they had walked right into the middle of a fairy tale, and they\r\nwere the more ready to believe it because they were so tired and hungry.\r\nThey were, in fact, so hungry and tired that they hardly noticed where\r\nthey were going, or observed the beauties of the formal gardens through\r\nwhich the pink-silk Princess was leading them. They were in a sort of\r\ndream, from which they only partially awakened to find themselves in a\r\nbig hall, with suits of armour and old flags round the walls, the skins\r\nof beasts on the floor, and heavy oak tables and benches ranged along\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Princess entered, slow and stately, but once inside she twitched her\r\nsheeny train out of Jimmy's hand and turned to the three.\r\n\r\n\"You just wait here a minute,\" she said, \"and mind you don't talk while\r\nI'm away. This castle is crammed with magic, and I don't know what will\r\nhappen if you talk.\" And with that, picking up the thick goldy-pink\r\nfolds under her arms, she ran out, as Jimmy said afterwards, \"most\r\nunprincesslike,\" showing as she ran black stockings and black strap\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nJimmy wanted very much to say that he didn't believe anything would\r\nhappen, only he was afraid something would happen if he did, so he\r\nmerely made a face and put out his tongue. The others pretended not to\r\nsee this, which was much more crushing than anything they could have\r\nsaid. So they sat in silence, and Gerald ground the heel of his boot\r\nupon the marble floor. Then the Princess came back, very slowly and\r\nkicking her long skirts in front of her at every step. She could not\r\nhold them up now because of the tray she carried.\r\n\r\nIt was not a silver tray, as you might have expected, but an oblong tin\r\none. She set it down noisily on the end of the long table and breathed a\r\nsigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! it _was_ heavy,\" she said. I don't know what fairy feast the\r\nchildren's fancy had been busy with. Anyhow, this was nothing like it.\r\nThe heavy tray held a loaf of bread, a lump of cheese, and a brown jug\r\nof water. The rest of its heaviness was just plates and mugs and knives.\r\n\r\n\"Come along,\" said the Princess hospitably. \"I couldn't find anything\r\nbut bread and cheese--but it doesn't matter, because everything's magic\r\nhere, and unless you have some dreadful secret fault the bread and\r\ncheese will turn into anything you like. What _would_ you like?\" she\r\nasked Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Roast chicken,\" said Kathleen, without hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe pinky Princess cut a slice of bread and laid it on a dish. \"There\r\nyou are,\" she said, \"roast chicken. Shall I carve it, or will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You, please,\" said Kathleen, and received a piece of dry bread on a\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n\"Green peas?\" asked the Princess, cut a piece of cheese and laid it\r\nbeside the bread.\r\n\r\nKathleen began to eat the bread, cutting it up with knife and fork as\r\nyou would eat chicken. It was no use owning that she didn't see any\r\nchicken and peas, or anything but cheese and dry bread, because that\r\nwould be owning that she had some dreadful secret fault.\r\n\r\n\"If I have, it _is_ a secret, even from me,\" she told herself.\r\n\r\nThe others asked for roast beef and cabbage--and got it, she supposed,\r\nthough to her it only looked like dry bread and Dutch cheese.\r\n\r\n\"I _do_ wonder what my dreadful secret fault is,\" she thought, as the\r\nPrincess remarked that, as for her, she could fancy a slice of roast\r\npeacock. \"This one,\" she added, lifting a second mouthful of dry bread\r\non her fork, \"is quite delicious.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a game, isn't it?\" asked Jimmy suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"What's a game?\" asked the Princess, frowning.\r\n\r\n\"Pretending it's beef--the bread and cheese, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"A game? But it _is_ beef. Look at it,\" said the Princess, opening her\r\neyes very wide.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Jimmy feebly. \"I was only joking.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"IT'S A GAME, ISN'T IT?\" ASKED JIMMY.]\r\n\r\nBread and cheese is not perhaps so good as roast beef or chicken or\r\npeacock (I'm not sure about the peacock. I never tasted peacock, did\r\nyou?); but bread and cheese is, at any rate, very much better than\r\nnothing when you have gone on having nothing since breakfast\r\n(gooseberries and gingerbeer hardly count) and it is long past your\r\nproper dinner-time. Every one ate and drank and felt much better.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the Princess, brushing the breadcrumbs off her green silk\r\nlap, \"if you're sure you won't have any more meat you can come and see\r\nmy treasures. Sure you won't take the least bit more chicken? No? Then\r\nfollow me.\"\r\n\r\nShe got up and they followed her down the long hall to the end where the\r\ngreat stone stairs ran up at each side and joined in a broad flight\r\nleading to the gallery above. Under the stairs was a hanging of\r\ntapestry.\r\n\r\n\"Beneath this arras,\" said the Princess, \"is the door leading to my\r\nprivate apartments.\" She held the tapestry up with both hands, for it\r\nwas heavy, and showed a little door that had been hidden by it.\r\n\r\n\"The key,\" she said, \"hangs above.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it did, on a large rusty nail.\r\n\r\n\"Put it in,\" said the Princess, \"and turn it.\"\r\n\r\nGerald did so, and the great key creaked and grated in the lock.\r\n\r\n\"Now push,\" she said; \"push hard, all of you.\"\r\n\r\nThey pushed hard, all of them. The door gave way, and they fell over\r\neach other into the dark space beyond.\r\n\r\nThe Princess dropped the curtain and came after them, closing the door\r\nbehind her.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" she said; \"look out! there are two steps down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Gerald, rubbing his knee at the bottom of the steps.\r\n\"We found that out for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" said the Princess, \"but you can't have hurt yourselves\r\nmuch. Go straight on. There aren't any more steps.\"\r\n\r\nThey went straight on--in the dark.\r\n\r\n\"When you come to the door just turn the handle and go in. Then stand\r\nstill till I find the matches. I know where they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they have matches a hundred years ago?\" asked Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"I meant the tinder-box,\" said the Princess quickly. \"We always called\r\nit the matches. Don't you? Here, let me go first.\"\r\n\r\nShe did, and when they had reached the door she was waiting for them\r\nwith a candle in her hand. She thrust it on Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Hold it steady,\" she said, and undid the shutters of a long window, so\r\nthat first a yellow streak and then a blazing great oblong of light\r\nflashed at them and the room was full of sunshine.\r\n\r\n\"It makes the candle look quite silly,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"So it does,\" said the Princess, and blew out the candle. Then she took\r\nthe key from the outside of the door, put it in the inside key-hole, and\r\nturned it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHE WAS WAITING FOR THEM WITH A CANDLE IN HER HAND.]\r\n\r\nThe room they were in was small and high. Its domed ceiling was of deep\r\nblue with gold stars painted on it. The walls were of wood, panelled\r\nand carved, and there was no furniture in it whatever.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said the Princess, \"is my treasure chamber.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where,\" asked Kathleen politely, \"_are_ the treasures?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see them?\" asked the Princess.\r\n\r\n\"No, we don't,\" said Jimmy bluntly. \"You don't come that\r\nbread-and-cheese game with me--not twice over, you don't!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you _really_ don't see them,\" said the Princess, \"I suppose I shall\r\nhave to say the charm. Shut your eyes, please. And give me your word of\r\nhonour you won't look till I tell you, and that you'll never tell any\r\none what you've seen.\"\r\n\r\nTheir words of honour were something that the children would rather not\r\nhave given just then, but they gave them all the same, and shut their\r\neyes tight.\r\n\r\n\"Wiggadil yougadoo begadee leegadeeve nowgadow?\" said the Princess\r\nrapidly; and they heard the swish of her silk train moving across the\r\nroom. Then there was a creaking, rustling noise.\r\n\r\n\"She's locking us in!\" cried Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Your word of honour,\" gasped Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do be quick!\" moaned Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"You may look,\" said the voice of the Princess. And they looked. The\r\nroom was not the same room, yet--yes, the starry-vaulted blue ceiling\r\nwas there, and below it half a dozen feet of the dark panelling, but\r\nbelow that the walls of the room blazed and sparkled with white and blue\r\nand red and green and gold and silver. Shelves ran round the room, and\r\non them were gold cups and silver dishes, and platters and goblets set\r\nwith gems, ornaments of gold and silver, tiaras of diamonds, necklaces\r\nof rubies, strings of emeralds and pearls, all set out in unimaginable\r\nsplendour against a background of faded blue velvet. It was like the\r\nCrown jewels that you see when your kind uncle takes you to the Tower,\r\nonly there seemed to be far more jewels than you or any one else has\r\never seen together at the Tower or anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThe three children remained breathless, open-mouthed, staring at the\r\nsparkling splendours all about them, while the Princess stood, her arm\r\nstretched out in a gesture of command, and a proud smile on her lips.\r\n\r\n\"My word!\" said Gerald, in a low whisper. But no one spoke out loud.\r\nThey waited as if spellbound for the Princess to speak.\r\n\r\nShe spoke.\r\n\r\n\"What price bread-and-cheese games now?\" she asked triumphantly. \"Can I\r\ndo magic, or can't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can; oh, you can!\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"May we--may we _touch_?\" asked Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"All that is mine is yours,\" said the Princess, with a generous wave of\r\nher brown hand, and added quickly, \"Only, of course, you mustn't take\r\nanything away with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're not thieves!\" said Jimmy. The others were already busy turning\r\nover the wonderful things on the blue velvet shelves.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" said the Princess, \"but you're a very unbelieving little\r\nboy. You think I can't see inside you, but I can. _I_ know what you've\r\nbeen thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you know well enough,\" said the Princess. \"You're thinking about\r\nthe bread and cheese that I changed into beef, and about your secret\r\nfault. I say, let's all dress up and you be princes and princesses too.\"\r\n\r\n\"To crown our hero,\" said Gerald, lifting a gold crown with a cross on\r\nthe top, \"was the work of a moment.\" He put the crown on his head, and\r\nadded a collar of SS and a zone of sparkling emeralds, which would not\r\nquite meet round his middle. He turned from fixing it by an ingenious\r\nadaptation of his belt to find the others already decked with diadems,\r\nnecklaces, and rings.\r\n\r\n\"How splendid you look!\" said the Princess, \"and how I wish your clothes\r\nwere prettier. What ugly clothes people wear nowadays! A hundred years\r\nago----\"\r\n\r\nKathleen stood quite still with a diamond bracelet raised in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" she said. \"The King and Queen?\"\r\n\r\n\"_What_ King and Queen?\" asked the Princess.\r\n\r\n\"Your father and mother, your sorrowing parents,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\"They'll have waked up by now. Won't they be wanting to see you, after a\r\nhundred years, you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--ah--yes,\" said the Princess slowly. \"I embraced my rejoicing\r\nparents when I got the bread and cheese. They're having their dinner.\r\nThey won't expect me yet. Here,\" she added, hastily putting a ruby\r\nbracelet on Kathleen's arm, \"see how splendid that is!\"\r\n\r\nKathleen would have been quite content to go on all day trying on\r\ndifferent jewels and looking at herself in the little silver-framed\r\nmirror that the Princess took from one of the shelves, but the boys were\r\nsoon weary of this amusement.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Gerald, \"if you're sure your father and mother won't\r\nwant you, let's go out and have a jolly good game of something. You\r\ncould play besieged castles awfully well in that maze--unless you can do\r\nany more magic tricks.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget,\" said the Princess, \"I'm grown up. I don't play games. And\r\nI don't like to do too much magic at a time, it's so tiring. Besides,\r\nit'll take us ever so long to put all these things back in their proper\r\nplaces.\"\r\n\r\nIt did. The children would have laid the jewels just anywhere; but the\r\nPrincess showed them that every necklace, or ring, or bracelet had its\r\nown home on the velvet--a slight hollowing in the shelf beneath, so that\r\neach stone fitted into its own little nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KATHLEEN LOOKING AT HERSELF IN THE LITTLE SILVER-FRAMED\r\nMIRROR.]\r\n\r\nAs Kathleen was fitting the last shining ornament into its proper place,\r\nshe saw that part of the shelf near it held, not bright jewels, but\r\nrings and brooches and chains, as well as queer things that she did not\r\nknow the names of, and all were of dull metal and odd shapes.\r\n\r\n\"What's all this rubbish?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Rubbish, indeed!\" said the Princess. \"Why those are _all_ magic things!\r\nThis bracelet--any one who wears it has got to speak the truth. This\r\nchain makes you as strong as ten men; if you wear this spur your horse\r\nwill go a mile a minute; or if you're walking it's the same as\r\nseven-league boots.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does this brooch do?\" asked Kathleen, reaching out her hand. The\r\nPrincess caught her by the wrist.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't touch,\" she said; \"if any one but me touches them all the\r\nmagic goes out at once and never comes back. That brooch will give you\r\nany wish you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this ring?\" Jimmy pointed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that makes you invisible.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's this?\" asked Gerald, showing a curious buckle.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that undoes the effect of all the other charms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean _really_?\" Jimmy asked. \"You're not just kidding?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kidding indeed!\" repeated the Princess scornfully. \"I should have\r\nthought I'd shown you enough magic to prevent you speaking to a Princess\r\nlike _that_!\"\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" said Gerald, visibly excited. \"You might show us how some of\r\nthe things act. Couldn't you give us each a wish?\"\r\n\r\nThe Princess did not at once answer. And the minds of the three played\r\nwith granted wishes--brilliant yet thoroughly reasonable--the kind of\r\nwish that never seems to occur to people in fairy tales when they\r\nsuddenly get a chance to have their three wishes granted.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Princess suddenly, \"no; I can't give wishes to _you_, it\r\nonly gives me wishes. But I'll let you see the ring make _me_ invisible.\r\nOnly you must shut your eyes while I do it.\"\r\n\r\nThey shut them.\r\n\r\n\"Count fifty,\" said the Princess, \"and then you may look. And then you\r\nmust shut them again, and count fifty, and I'll reappear.\"\r\n\r\nGerald counted, aloud. Through the counting one could hear a creaking,\r\nrustling sound.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty!\" said Gerald, and they\r\nopened their eyes.\r\n\r\nThey were alone in the room. The jewels had vanished and so had the\r\nPrincess.\r\n\r\n\"She's gone out by the door, of course,\" said Jimmy, but the door was\r\nlocked.\r\n\r\n\"That _is_ magic,\" said Kathleen breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Maskelyne and Devant can do _that_ trick,\" said Jimmy. \"And I want my\r\ntea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your tea!\" Gerald's tone was full of contempt. \"The lovely Princess,\"\r\nhe went on, \"reappeared as soon as our hero had finished counting fifty.\r\nOne, two, three, four----\"\r\n\r\nGerald and Kathleen had both closed their eyes. But somehow Jimmy\r\nhadn't. He didn't mean to cheat, he just forgot. And as Gerald's count\r\nreached twenty he saw a panel under the window open slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Her,\" he said to himself. \"I _knew_ it was a trick!\" and at once shut\r\nhis eyes, like an honourable little boy.\r\n\r\nOn the word \"fifty\" six eyes opened. And the panel was closed and there\r\nwas no Princess.\r\n\r\n\"She hasn't pulled it off this time,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you'd better count again,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"I believe there's a cupboard under the window,\" said Jimmy, \"and she's\r\nhidden in it. Secret panel, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You looked! that's cheating,\" said the voice of the Princess so close\r\nto his ear that he quite jumped.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't cheat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where on earth---- What ever----\" said all three together. For still\r\nthere was no Princess to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Come back visible, Princess dear,\" said Kathleen. \"Shall we shut our\r\neyes and count again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be silly!\" said the voice of the Princess, and it sounded very\r\ncross.\r\n\r\n\"We're _not_ silly,\" said Jimmy, and his voice was cross too. \"Why can't\r\nyou come back and have done with it? You know you're only hiding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't!\" said Kathleen gently. \"She _is_ invisible, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"So should I be if I got into the cupboard,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" said the sneering tone of the Princess, \"you think yourselves\r\nvery clever, I dare say. But _I_ don't mind. We'll play that you _can't_\r\nsee me, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but we _can't_,\" said Gerald. \"It's no use getting in a wax. If\r\nyou're hiding, as Jimmy says, you'd better come out. If you've really\r\nturned invisible, you'd better make yourself visible again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really mean,\" asked a voice quite changed, but still the\r\nPrincess's, \"that you _can't_ see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you _see_ we can't?\" asked Jimmy rather unreasonably.\r\n\r\nThe sun was blazing in at the window; the eight-sided room was very hot,\r\nand every one was getting cross.\r\n\r\n\"You can't _see_ me?\" There was the sound of a sob in the voice of the\r\ninvisible Princess.\r\n\r\n\"_No_, I tell you,\" said Jimmy, \"and I want my tea--and----\"\r\n\r\nWhat he was saying was broken off short, as one might break a stick of\r\nsealing wax. And then in the golden afternoon a really quite horrid\r\nthing happened: Jimmy suddenly leaned backwards, then forwards, his eyes\r\nopened wide and his mouth too. Backward and forward he went, very\r\nquickly and abruptly, then stood still.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he's in a fit! Oh, Jimmy, dear Jimmy!\" cried Kathleen, hurrying to\r\nhim. \"What is it, dear, what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's _not_ a fit,\" gasped Jimmy angrily. \"She shook me.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BACKWARD AND FORWARD HE WENT.]\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the voice of the Princess, \"and I'll shake him again if he\r\nkeeps on saying he can't see me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better shake _me_,\" said Gerald angrily. \"I'm nearer your own\r\nsize.\"\r\n\r\nAnd instantly she did. But not for long. The moment Gerald felt hands on\r\nhis shoulders he put up his own and caught those other hands by the\r\nwrists. And there he was, holding wrists that he couldn't see. It was a\r\ndreadful sensation. An invisible kick made him wince, but he held tight\r\nto the wrists.\r\n\r\n\"Cathy,\" he cried, \"come and hold her legs; she's kicking me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" cried Kathleen, anxious to help. \"I don't _see_ any legs.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is her hands I've got,\" cried Gerald. \"She _is_ invisible right\r\nenough. Get hold of this hand, and then you can feel your way down to\r\nher legs.\"\r\n\r\nKathleen did so. I wish I could make you understand how very, very\r\nuncomfortable and frightening it is to feel, in broad daylight, hands\r\nand arms that you can't see.\r\n\r\n\"I _won't_ have you hold my legs,\" said the invisible Princess,\r\nstruggling violently.\r\n\r\n\"What are you so cross about?\" Gerald was quite calm. \"You said you'd be\r\ninvisible, and you _are_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are really. Look in the glass.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not; I can't be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look in the glass,\" Gerald repeated, quite unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"Let go, then,\" she said.\r\n\r\nGerald did, and the moment he had done so he found it impossible to\r\nbelieve that he really had been holding invisible hands.\r\n\r\n\"You're just pretending not to see me,\" said the Princess anxiously,\r\n\"aren't you? Do say you are. You've had your joke with me. Don't keep it\r\nup. I don't like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"On our sacred word of honour,\" said Gerald, \"you're still invisible.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Then, \"Come,\" said the Princess. \"I'll let you out,\r\nand you can go. I'm tired of playing with you.\"\r\n\r\nThey followed her voice to the door, and through it, and along the\r\nlittle passage into the hall. No one said anything. Every one felt very\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get out of this,\" whispered Jimmy as they got to the end of the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nBut the voice of the Princess said: \"Come out this way; it's quicker. I\r\nthink you're perfectly hateful. I'm sorry I ever played with you. Mother\r\nalways told me not to play with strange children.\"\r\n\r\nA door abruptly opened, though no hand was seen to touch it. \"Come\r\nthrough, can't you!\" said the voice of the Princess.\r\n\r\nIt was a little ante-room, with long, narrow mirrors between its long,\r\nnarrow windows.\r\n\r\n\"Goodbye,\" said Gerald. \"Thanks for giving us such a jolly time. Let's\r\npart friends,\" he added, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\nAn unseen hand was slowly put in his, which closed on it, vice-like.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said, \"you've jolly well _got_ to look in the glass and own\r\nthat we're not liars.\"\r\n\r\nHe led the invisible Princess to one of the mirrors, and held her in\r\nfront of it by the shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said, \"you just look for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, and then a cry of despair rang through the room.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--oh--oh! I _am_ invisible. Whatever shall I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take the ring off,\" said Kathleen, suddenly practical.\r\n\r\nAnother silence.\r\n\r\n\"I _can't_!\" cried the Princess. \"It won't come off. But it can't be the\r\nring; rings don't make you invisible.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said this one did,\" said Kathleen, \"and it has.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it _can't_,\" said the Princess. \"I was only playing at magic. I\r\njust hid in the secret cupboard--it was only a game. Oh, whatever\r\n_shall_ I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"A game?\" said Gerald slowly; \"but you _can_ do magic--the invisible\r\njewels, and you made them come visible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's only a secret spring and the panelling slides up. Oh, what am\r\nI to do?\"\r\n\r\nKathleen moved towards the voice and gropingly got her arms round a\r\npink-silk waist that she couldn't see. Invisible arms clasped her, a hot\r\ninvisible cheek was laid against hers, and warm invisible tears lay wet\r\nbetween the two faces.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cry, dear,\" said Kathleen; \"let me go and tell the King and\r\nQueen.\"\r\n\r\n\"The----?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your royal father and mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _don't_ mock me!\" said the poor Princess. \"You _know_ that was only\r\na game, too, like----\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the bread and cheese,\" said Jimmy triumphantly. \"I knew _that_\r\nwas!\"\r\n\r\n\"But your dress and being asleep in the maze, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I dressed up for fun, because every one's away at the fair, and I\r\nput the clue just to make it all more real. I was playing at Fair\r\nRosamond first, and then I heard you talking in the maze, and I thought\r\nwhat fun; and now I'm invisible, and I shall never come right again,\r\nnever--I know I shan't! It serves me right for lying, but I didn't\r\nreally think you'd believe it--not more than half, that is,\" she added\r\nhastily, trying to be truthful.\r\n\r\n\"But if you're not the Princess, who _are_ you?\" asked Kathleen, still\r\nembracing the unseen.\r\n\r\n\"I'm--my aunt lives here,\" said the invisible Princess. \"She may be home\r\nany time. Oh, what shall I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps she knows some charm----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nonsense!\" said the voice sharply; \"she doesn't believe in charms.\r\nShe _would_ be so vexed. Oh, I daren't let her see me like this!\" she\r\nadded wildly. \"And all of you here, too. She'd be so dreadfully cross.\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful magic castle that the children had believed in now felt\r\nas though it were tumbling about their ears. All that was left was the\r\ninvisibleness of the Princess. But that, you will own, was a good deal.\r\n\r\n\"I just said it,\" moaned the voice, \"and it came true. I wish I'd never\r\nplayed at magic--I wish I'd never played at anything at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't say that,\" Gerald said kindly. \"Let's go out into the garden,\r\nnear the lake, where it's cool, and we'll hold a solemn council. You'll\r\nlike that, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried Kathleen suddenly, \"the buckle; that makes magic come\r\nundone!\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't _really_,\" murmured the voice that seemed to speak without\r\nlips. \"I only just _said_ that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You only 'just said' about the ring,\" said Gerald. \"Anyhow, let's try.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not _you_--_me_,\" said the voice. \"You go down to the Temple of Flora,\r\nby the lake. I'll go back to the jewel-room by myself. Aunt might see\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"She won't see _you_,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Don't rub it in,\" said Gerald. \"Where _is_ the Temple of Flora?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the way,\" the voice said; \"down those steps and along the\r\nwinding path through the shrubbery. You can't miss it. It's white\r\nmarble, with a statue goddess inside.\"\r\n\r\nThe three children went down to the white marble Temple of Flora that\r\nstood close against the side of the little hill, and sat down in its\r\nshadowy inside. It had arches all round except against the hill behind\r\nthe statue, and it was cool and restful.\r\n\r\nThey had not been there five minutes before the feet of a runner sounded\r\nloud on the gravel. A shadow, very black and distinct, fell on the white\r\nmarble floor.\r\n\r\n\"Your shadow's not invisible anyhow,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, bother my shadow!\" the voice of the Princess replied. \"We left the\r\nkey inside the door, and it's shut itself with the wind, and it's a\r\nspring lock!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a heartfelt pause.\r\n\r\nThen Gerald said, in his most business-like manner:\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, Princess, and we'll have a thorough good palaver about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't wonder,\" said Jimmy, \"if we was to wake up and find it was\r\ndreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"No such luck,\" said the voice.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Gerald, \"first of all, what's your name, and if you're not\r\na Princess, who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm--I'm,\" said a voice broken with sobs, \"I'm\r\nthe--housekeeper's--niece--at--the--castle--and my name's Mabel Prowse.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly what I thought,\" said Jimmy, without a shadow of truth,\r\nbecause how could he? The others were silent. It was a moment full of\r\nagitation and confused ideas.\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyhow,\" said Gerald, \"you belong here.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"YOUR SHADOW'S NOT INVISIBLE, ANYHOW,\" SAID JIMMY.]\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the voice, and it came from the floor, as though its owner\r\nhad flung herself down in the madness of despair. \"Oh yes, I belong here\r\nright enough, but what's the use of belonging anywhere if you're\r\ninvisible?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOSE of my readers who have gone about much with an invisible companion\r\nwill not need to be told how awkward the whole business is. For one\r\nthing, however much you may have been convinced that your companion _is_\r\ninvisible, you will, I feel sure, have found yourself every now and then\r\nsaying, \"This _must_ be a dream!\" or \"I _know_ I shall wake up in half a\r\nsec!\" And this was the case with Gerald, Kathleen, and Jimmy as they sat\r\nin the white marble Temple of Flora, looking out through its arches at\r\nthe sunshiny park and listening to the voice of the enchanted Princess,\r\nwho really was not a Princess at all, but just the housekeeper's niece,\r\nMabel Prowse; though, as Jimmy said, \"she was enchanted, right enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no use talking,\" she said again and again, and the voice came from\r\nan empty-looking space between two pillars; \"I never believed anything\r\nwould happen, and now it has.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Gerald kindly, \"can we do anything for you? Because, if\r\nnot, I think we ought to be going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jimmy; \"I _do_ want my tea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tea!\" said the unseen Mabel scornfully. \"Do you mean to say you'd go\r\noff to your teas and leave me after getting me into this mess?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, of all the unfair Princesses I ever met!\" Gerald began. But\r\nKathleen interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't rag her,\" she said. \"Think how horrid it must be to be\r\ninvisible!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think,\" said the hidden Mabel, \"that my aunt likes me very much\r\nas it is. She wouldn't let me go to the fair because I'd forgotten to\r\nput back some old trumpery shoe that Queen Elizabeth wore--I got it out\r\nfrom the glass case to try it on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did it fit?\" asked Kathleen, with interest.\r\n\r\n\"Not it--much too small,\" said Mabel. \"I don't believe it ever fitted\r\nany one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do want my tea!\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"I do really think perhaps we ought to go,\" said Gerald. \"You see, it\r\nisn't as if we could do anything for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to tell your aunt,\" said Kathleen kindly.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no!\" moaned Mabel invisibly; \"take me with you. I'll leave her\r\na note to say I've run away to sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Girls don't run away to sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"They might,\" said the stone floor between the pillars, \"as stowaways,\r\nif nobody wanted a cabin boy--cabin girl, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you oughtn't,\" said Kathleen firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what _am_ I to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said Gerald, \"I don't know what the girl _can_ do. Let her\r\ncome home with us and have----\"\r\n\r\n\"Tea--oh, yes,\" said Jimmy, jumping up.\r\n\r\n\"And have a good council.\"\r\n\r\n\"After tea,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"But her aunt'll find she's gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"So she would if I stayed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come on,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"But the aunt'll think something's happened to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it has.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she'll tell the police, and they'll look everywhere for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll never find you,\" said Gerald. \"Talk of impenetrable disguises!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure,\" said Mabel, \"aunt would much rather never see me again than\r\nsee me like this. She'd never get over it; it might kill her--she has\r\nspasms as it is. I'll write to her, and we'll put it in the big\r\nletter-box at the gate as we go out. Has any one got a bit of pencil and\r\na scrap of paper?\"\r\n\r\nGerald had a note-book, with leaves of the shiny kind which you have to\r\nwrite on, not with a blacklead pencil, but with an ivory thing with a\r\npoint of real lead. And it won't write on any other paper except the\r\nkind that is in the book, and this is often very annoying when you are\r\nin a hurry. Then was seen the strange spectacle of a little ivory stick,\r\nwith a leaden point, standing up at an odd, impossible-looking slant,\r\nand moving along all by itself as ordinary pencils do when you are\r\nwriting with them.\r\n\r\n\"May we look over?\" asked Kathleen.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. The pencil went on writing.\r\n\r\n\"Mayn't we look over?\" Kathleen said again.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you may!\" said the voice near the paper. \"I nodded, didn't I?\r\nOh, I forgot, my nodding's invisible too.\"\r\n\r\nThe pencil was forming round, clear letters on the page torn out of the\r\nnote-book. This is what it wrote:--\r\n\r\n          \"DEAR AUNT,--\r\n\r\n          \"I am afraid you will not see me again for some\r\n          time. A lady in a motor-car has adopted me, and we\r\n          are going straight to the coast and then in a\r\n          ship. It is useless to try to follow me. Farewell,\r\n          and may you be happy. I hope you enjoyed the fair.\r\n\r\n                                                    \"MABEL.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's all lies,\" said Jimmy bluntly.\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't; it's fancy,\" said Mabel. \"If I said I've become\r\ninvisible, she'd think that was a lie, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _come_ along,\" said Jimmy; \"you can quarrel just as well walking.\"\r\n\r\nGerald folded up the note as a lady in India had taught him to do years\r\nbefore, and Mabel led them by another and very much nearer way out of\r\nthe park. And the walk home was a great deal shorter, too, than the walk\r\nout had been.\r\n\r\nThe sky had clouded over while they were in the Temple of Flora, and the\r\nfirst spots of rain fell as they got back to the house, very late indeed\r\nfor tea.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle was looking out of the window, and came herself to open the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"But it is that you are in lateness, in lateness!\" she cried. \"You have\r\nhad a misfortune--no? All goes well?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are very sorry indeed,\" said Gerald. \"It took us longer to get home\r\nthan we expected. I do hope you haven't been anxious. I have been\r\nthinking about you most of the way home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, then,\" said the French lady, smiling; \"you shall have them in the\r\nsame time--the tea and the supper.\"\r\n\r\nWhich they did.\r\n\r\n\"How _could_ you say you were thinking about her all the time?\" said a\r\nvoice just by Gerald's ear, when Mademoiselle had left them alone with\r\nthe bread and butter and milk and baked apples. \"It was just as much a\r\nlie as me being adopted by a motor lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it wasn't,\" said Gerald, through bread and butter. \"I _was_\r\nthinking about whether she'd be in a wax or not. So there!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IT WAS RATHER HORRID TO SEE THE BREAD AND BUTTER WAVING\r\nABOUT IN THE AIR.]\r\n\r\nThere were only three plates, but Jimmy let Mabel have his, and shared\r\nwith Kathleen. It was rather horrid to see the bread and butter waving\r\nabout in the air, and bite after bite disappearing from it apparently by\r\nno human agency; and the spoon rising with apple in it and returning to\r\nthe plate empty. Even the tip of the spoon disappeared as long as it was\r\nin Mabel's unseen mouth; so that at times it looked as though its bowl\r\nhad been broken off.\r\n\r\nEvery one was very hungry, and more bread and butter had to be fetched.\r\nCook grumbled when the plate was filled for the third time.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what,\" said Jimmy; \"I did want my tea.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell _you_ what,\" said Gerald; \"it'll be jolly difficult to give\r\nMabel any breakfast. Mademoiselle will be here then. She'd have a fit if\r\nshe saw bits of forks with bacon on them vanishing, and then the forks\r\ncoming back out of vanishment, and the bacon lost for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to buy things to eat and feed our poor captive in\r\nsecret,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Our money won't last long,\" said Jimmy, in gloom. \"Have _you_ got any\r\nmoney?\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to where a mug of milk was suspended in the air without\r\nvisible means of support.\r\n\r\n\"I've not got much money,\" was the reply from near the milk, \"but I've\r\ngot heaps of ideas.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must talk about everything in the morning,\" said Kathleen. \"We must\r\njust say good-night to Mademoiselle, and then you shall sleep in my bed,\r\nMabel. I'll lend you one of my nightgowns.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get my own to-morrow,\" said Mabel cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"You'll go back to get things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? Nobody can see me. I think I begin to see all sorts of amusing\r\nthings coming along. It's not half bad being invisible.\"\r\n\r\nIt was extremely odd, Kathleen thought, to see the Princess's clothes\r\ncoming out of nothing. First the gauzy veil appeared hanging in the air.\r\nThen the sparkling coronet suddenly showed on the top of the chest of\r\ndrawers. Then a sleeve of the pinky gown showed, then another, and then\r\nthe whole gown lay on the floor in a glistening ring as the unseen legs\r\nof Mabel stepped out of it. For each article of clothing became visible\r\nas Mabel took it off. The nightgown, lifted from the bed, disappeared a\r\nbit at a time.\r\n\r\n\"Get into bed,\" said Kathleen, rather nervously.\r\n\r\nThe bed creaked and a hollow appeared in the pillow. Kathleen put out\r\nthe gas and got into bed; all this magic had been rather upsetting, and\r\nshe was just the least bit frightened, but in the dark she found it was\r\nnot so bad. Mabel's arms went round her neck the moment she got into\r\nbed, and the two little girls kissed in the kind darkness, where the\r\nvisible and the invisible could meet on equal terms.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night,\" said Mabel. \"You're a darling, Cathy; you've been most\r\nawfully good to me, and I sha'n't forget it. I didn't like to say so\r\nbefore the boys, because I know boys think you're a muff if you're\r\ngrateful. But I _am_. Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nKathleen lay awake for some time. She was just getting sleepy when she\r\nremembered that the maid who would call them in the morning would see\r\nthose wonderful Princess clothes.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to get up and hide them,\" she said. \"What a bother!\"\r\n\r\nAnd as she lay thinking what a bother it was she happened to fall\r\nasleep, and when she woke again it was bright morning, and Eliza was\r\nstanding in front of the chair where Mabel's clothes lay, gazing at the\r\npink Princess-frock that lay on the top of her heap and saying, \"Law!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't touch, _please_!\" Kathleen leaped out of bed as Eliza was\r\nreaching out her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Where on earth did you get hold of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're going to use it for acting,\" said Kathleen, on the desperate\r\ninspiration of the moment. \"It's lent me for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might show _me_, miss,\" suggested Eliza.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please not!\" said Kathleen, standing in front of the chair in her\r\nnightgown. \"You shall see us act when we are dressed up. There! And you\r\nwon't tell any one, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if you're a good little girl,\" said Eliza. \"But you be sure to let\r\nme see when you _do_ dress up. But where----\"\r\n\r\nHere a bell rang and Eliza had to go, for it was the postman, and she\r\nparticularly wanted to see him.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Kathleen, pulling on her first stocking, \"we shall have\r\nto _do_ the acting. Everything seems very difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\"Acting isn't,\" said Mabel; and an unsupported stocking waved in the air\r\nand quickly vanished. \"I shall love it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget,\" said Kathleen gently, \"invisible actresses can't take part\r\nin plays unless they're magic ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" cried a voice from under a petticoat that hung in the air, \"I've\r\ngot _such_ an idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell it us after breakfast,\" said Kathleen, as the water in the basin\r\nbegan to splash about and to drip from nowhere back into itself. \"And\r\noh! I do wish you hadn't written such whoppers to your aunt. I'm sure we\r\noughtn't to tell lies for anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of telling the truth if nobody believes you?\" came from\r\namong the splashes.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Kathleen, \"but I'm sure we ought to tell the\r\ntruth.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ can, if you like,\" said a voice from the folds of a towel that\r\nwaved lonely in front of the wash-hand stand.\r\n\r\n\"All right. We will, then, first thing after brek--_your_ brek, I mean.\r\nYou'll have to wait up here till we can collar something and bring it\r\nup to you. Mind you dodge Eliza when she comes to make the bed.\"\r\n\r\nThe invisible Mabel found this a fairly amusing game; she further\r\nenlivened it by twitching out the corners of tucked-up sheets and\r\nblankets when Eliza wasn't looking.\r\n\r\n\"Drat the clothes!\" said Eliza; \"anyone ud think the things was\r\nbewitched.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked about for the wonderful Princess clothes she had glimpsed\r\nearlier in the morning. But Kathleen had hidden them in a perfectly safe\r\nplace under the mattress, which she knew Eliza never turned.\r\n\r\nEliza hastily brushed up from the floor those bits of fluff which come\r\nfrom goodness knows where in the best regulated houses. Mabel, very\r\nhungry and exasperated at the long absence of the others at their\r\nbreakfast, could not forbear to whisper suddenly in Eliza's ear:--\r\n\r\n\"Always sweep under the mats.\"\r\n\r\nThe maid started and turned pale. \"I must be going silly,\" she murmured;\r\n\"though it's just what mother always used to say. Hope I ain't going\r\ndotty, like Aunt Emily. Wonderful what you can fancy, ain't it?\"\r\n\r\nShe took up the hearth-rug all the same, swept under it, and under the\r\nfender. So thorough was she, and so pale, that Kathleen, entering with a\r\nchunk of bread raided by Gerald from the pantry window, exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n\"Not done yet. I say, Eliza, you do look ill! What's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I'd give the room a good turn-out,\" said Eliza, still very\r\npale.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing's happened to upset you?\" Kathleen asked. She had her own\r\nprivate fears.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing only my fancy, miss,\" said Eliza. \"I always was fanciful from a\r\nchild--dreaming of the pearly gates and them little angels with nothing\r\non only their heads and wings--so cheap to dress, I always think,\r\ncompared with children.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she was got rid of, Mabel ate the bread and drank water from the\r\ntooth-mug.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid it tastes of cherry tooth-paste rather,\" said Kathleen\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter,\" a voice replied from the tilted mug; \"it's more\r\ninteresting than water. I should think red wine in ballads was rather\r\nlike this.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got leave for the day again,\" said Kathleen, when the last bit of\r\nbread had vanished, \"and Gerald feels like I do about lies. So we're\r\ngoing to tell your aunt where you really are.\"\r\n\r\n\"She won't believe you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't matter, if we speak the truth,\" said Kathleen primly.\r\n\r\n\"I expect you'll be sorry for it,\" said Mabel; \"but come on--and, I say,\r\ndo be careful not to shut me in the door as you go out. You nearly did\r\njust now.\"\r\n\r\nIn the blazing sunlight that flooded the High Street four shadows to\r\nthree children seemed dangerously noticeable. A butcher's boy looked far\r\ntoo earnestly at the extra shadow, and his big, liver-coloured lurcher\r\nsnuffed at the legs of that shadow's mistress and whined uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n\"Get behind me,\" said Kathleen; \"then our two shadows will look like\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mabel's shadow, very visible, fell on Kathleen's back, and the\r\nostler of the Davenant Arms looked up to see what big bird had cast that\r\nbig shadow.\r\n\r\nA woman driving a cart with chickens and ducks in it called out:--\r\n\r\n\"Halloa, missy, ain't you blacked yer back neither! What you been\r\nleaning up against?\"\r\n\r\nEvery one was glad when they got out of the town.\r\n\r\nSpeaking the truth to Mabel's aunt did not turn out at all as any\r\none--even Mabel--expected. The aunt was discovered reading a pink\r\nnovelette at the window of the housekeeper's room, which, framed in\r\nclematis and green creepers, looked out on a nice little courtyard to\r\nwhich Mabel led the party.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" said Gerald, \"but I believe you've lost your niece?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not lost, my boy,\" said the aunt, who was spare and tall, with a drab\r\nfringe and a very genteel voice.\r\n\r\n\"We could tell you something about her,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HALLOA, MISSY, AIN'T YOU BLACKED YER BACK, NEITHER!\"]\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" replied the aunt, in a warning voice, \"no complaints, please. My\r\nniece has gone, and I am sure no one thinks less than I do of her little\r\npranks. If she's played any tricks on you it's only her light-hearted\r\nway. Go away, children, I'm busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you get her note?\" asked Kathleen.\r\n\r\nThe aunt showed rather more interest than before, but she still kept her\r\nfinger in the novelette.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"so you witnessed her departure? Did she seem glad to\r\ngo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite,\" said Gerald truthfully.\r\n\r\n\"Then I can only be glad that she is provided for,\" said the aunt. \"I\r\ndare say you were surprised. These romantic adventures do occur in our\r\nfamily. Lord Yalding selected me out of eleven applicants for the post\r\nof housekeeper here. I've not the slightest doubt the child was changed\r\nat birth and her rich relatives have claimed her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But aren't you going to do anything--tell the police, or----\"\r\n\r\n\"Shish!\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ won't shish,\" said Jimmy. \"Your Mabel's invisible--that's all it\r\nis. She's just beside me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I detest untruthfulness,\" said the aunt severely, \"in all its forms.\r\nWill you kindly take that little boy away? I am quite satisfied about\r\nMabel.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Well_,\" said Gerald, \"you _are_ an aunt and no mistake! But what will\r\nMabel's father and mother say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mabel's father and mother are dead,\" said the aunt calmly, and a little\r\nsob sounded close to Gerald's ear.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said, \"we'll be off. But don't you go saying we didn't\r\ntell you the truth, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have told me nothing,\" said the aunt, \"none of you, except that\r\nlittle boy, who has told me a silly falsehood.\"\r\n\r\n\"We meant well,\" said Gerald gently. \"You don't mind our having come\r\nthrough the grounds, do you? We're very careful not to touch anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"No visitors are allowed,\" said the aunt, glancing down at her novel\r\nrather impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! but you wouldn't count _us_ visitors,\" said Gerald in his best\r\nmanner. \"We're friends of Mabel's. Our father's Colonel of the --th.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" said the aunt.\r\n\r\n\"And our aunt's Lady Sandling, so you can be sure we wouldn't hurt\r\nanything on the estate.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you wouldn't hurt a fly,\" said the aunt absently. \"Goodbye. Be\r\ngood children.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on this they got away quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Gerald, when they were outside the little court, \"your\r\naunt's as mad as a hatter. Fancy not caring what becomes of you, and\r\nfancy believing that rot about the motor lady!\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew she'd believe it when I wrote it,\" said Mabel modestly. \"She's\r\nnot mad, only she's always reading novelettes. _I_ read the books in the\r\nbig library. Oh, it's such a jolly room--such a queer smell, like boots,\r\nand old leather books sort of powdery at the edges. I'll take you there\r\nsome day. Now your consciences are all right about my aunt, I'll tell\r\nyou my great idea. Let's get down to the Temple of Flora. I'm glad you\r\ngot aunt's permission for the grounds. It would be so awkward for you to\r\nhave to be always dodging behind bushes when one of the gardeners came\r\nalong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Gerald modestly, \"I thought of that.\"\r\n\r\nThe day was as bright as yesterday had been, and from the white marble\r\ntemple the Italian-looking landscape looked more than ever like a steel\r\nengraving coloured by hand, or an oleographic imitation of one of\r\nTurner's pictures.\r\n\r\nWhen the three children were comfortably settled on the steps that led\r\nup to the white statue, the voice of the fourth child said sadly: \"I'm\r\nnot ungrateful, but I'm rather hungry. And you can't be always taking\r\nthings for me through your larder window. If you like, I'll go back and\r\nlive in the castle. It's supposed to be haunted. I suppose I could haunt\r\nit as well as any one else. I am a sort of ghost now, you know. I will\r\nif you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" said Kathleen kindly; \"you must stay with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But about food. I'm not ungrateful, really I'm not, but breakfast is\r\nbreakfast, and bread's only bread.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you could get the ring off, you could go back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mabel's voice, \"but you see, I can't. I tried again last\r\nnight in bed, and again this morning. And it's like stealing, taking\r\nthings out of your larder--even if it's only bread.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" said Gerald, who had carried out this bold enterprise.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, what we must do is to earn some money.\"\r\n\r\nJimmy remarked that this was all very well. But Gerald and Kathleen\r\nlistened attentively.\r\n\r\n\"What I mean to say,\" the voice went on, \"I'm really sure is all for the\r\nbest, me being invisible. We shall have adventures--you see if we\r\ndon't.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Adventures,' said the bold buccaneer, 'are not always profitable.'\" It\r\nwas Gerald who murmured this.\r\n\r\n\"This one will be, anyhow, you see. Only you mustn't all go. Look here,\r\nif Jerry could make himself look common----\"\r\n\r\n\"That ought to be easy,\" said Jimmy. And Kathleen told him not to be so\r\njolly disagreeable.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not,\" said Jimmy, \"only----\"\r\n\r\n\"Only he has an inside feeling that this Mabel of yours is going to get\r\nus into trouble,\" put in Gerald. \"Like La Belle Dame Sans Merci, and he\r\ndoes not want to be found in future ages alone and palely loitering in\r\nthe middle of sedge and things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't get you into trouble, indeed I won't,\" said the voice. \"Why,\r\nwe're a band of brothers for life, after the way you stood by me\r\nyesterday. What I mean is--Gerald can go to the fair and do conjuring.\"\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't know any,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ should do it really,\" said Mabel, \"but Jerry could look like doing\r\nit. Move things without touching them and all that. But it wouldn't do\r\nfor all three of you to go. The more there are of children the younger\r\nthey look, I think, and the more people wonder what they're doing all\r\nalone by themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"The accomplished conjurer deemed these the words of wisdom,\" said\r\nGerald; and answered the dismal \"Well, but what about us?\" of his\r\nbrother and sister by suggesting that they should mingle unsuspected\r\nwith the crowd. \"But don't let on that you know me,\" he said; \"and try\r\nto look as if you belonged to some of the grown-ups at the fair. If you\r\ndon't, as likely as not you'll have the kind policemen taking the little\r\nlost children by the hand and leading them home to their stricken\r\nrelations--French governess, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go _now_,\" said the voice that they never could get quite used to\r\nhearing, coming out of different parts of the air as Mabel moved from\r\none place to another. So they went.\r\n\r\nThe fair was held on a waste bit of land, about half a mile from the\r\ncastle gates. When they got near enough to hear the steam-organ of the\r\nmerry-go-round, Gerald suggested that as he had ninepence he should go\r\nahead and get something to eat, the amount spent to be paid back out of\r\nany money they might make by conjuring. The others waited in the shadows\r\nof a deep-banked lane, and he came back, quite soon, though long after\r\nthey had begun to say what a long time he had been gone. He brought some\r\nBarcelona nuts, red-streaked apples, small sweet yellow pears, pale\r\npasty gingerbread, a whole quarter of a pound of peppermint bull's-eyes,\r\nand two bottles of gingerbeer.\r\n\r\n\"It's what they call an investment,\" he said, when Kathleen said\r\nsomething about extravagance. \"We shall all need special nourishing to\r\nkeep our strength up, especially the bold conjurer.\"\r\n\r\nThey ate and drank. It was a very beautiful meal, and the far-off music\r\nof the steam-organ added the last touch of festivity to the scene. The\r\nboys were never tired of seeing Mabel eat, or rather of seeing the\r\nstrange, magic-looking vanishment of food which was all that showed of\r\nMabel's eating. They were entranced by the spectacle, and pressed on her\r\nmore than her just share of the feast, just for the pleasure of seeing\r\nit disappear.\r\n\r\n\"My aunt!\" said Gerald, again and again; \"that ought to knock 'em!\"\r\n\r\nIt did.\r\n\r\nJimmy and Kathleen had the start of the others, and when they got to the\r\nfair they mingled with the crowd, and were as unsuspected as possible.\r\n\r\nThey stood near a large lady who was watching the cocoanut shies, and\r\npresently saw a strange figure with its hands in its pockets strolling\r\nacross the trampled yellowy grass among the bits of drifting paper and\r\nthe sticks and straws that always litter the ground of an English fair.\r\nIt was Gerald, but at first they hardly knew him. He had taken off his\r\ntie, and round his head, arranged like a turban, was the crimson\r\nschool-scarf that had supported his white flannels. The tie, one\r\nsupposed, had taken on the duties of the handkerchief. And his face and\r\nhands were a bright black, like very nicely polished stoves!\r\n\r\nEvery one turned to look at him.\r\n\r\n\"He's just like a nigger!\" whispered Jimmy. \"I don't suppose it'll ever\r\ncome off, do you?\"\r\n\r\nThey followed him at a distance, and when he went close to the door of a\r\nsmall tent, against whose door-post a long-faced melancholy woman was\r\nlounging, they stopped and tried to look as though they belonged to a\r\nfarmer who strove to send up a number by banging with a big mallet on a\r\nwooden block.\r\n\r\nGerald went up to the woman.\r\n\r\n\"Taken much?\" he asked, and was told, but not harshly, to go away with\r\nhis impudence.\r\n\r\n\"I'm in business myself,\" said Gerald, \"I'm a conjurer, from India.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not you!\" said the woman; \"you ain't no nigger. Why, the backs of yer\r\nears is all white.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they?\" said Gerald. \"How clever of you to see that!\" He rubbed them\r\nwith his hands. \"That better?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right. What's your little game?\"\r\n\r\n\"Conjuring, really and truly,\" said Gerald. \"There's smaller boys than\r\nme put on to it in India. Look here, I owe you one for telling me about\r\nmy ears. If you like to run the show for me I'll go shares. Let me have\r\nyour tent to perform in, and you do the patter at the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lor' love you! I can't do no patter. And you're getting at me. Let's\r\nsee you do a bit of conjuring, since you're so clever an' all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right you are,\" said Gerald firmly. \"You see this apple? Well, I'll\r\nmake it move slowly through the air, and then when I say 'Go!' it'll\r\nvanish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--into your mouth! Get away with your nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're too clever to be so unbelieving,\" said Gerald. \"Look here!\"\r\n\r\nHe held out one of the little apples, and the woman saw it move slowly\r\nand unsupported along the air.\r\n\r\n\"Now--_go_!\" cried Gerald, to the apple, and it went. \"How's that?\" he\r\nasked, in tones of triumph.\r\n\r\nThe woman was glowing with excitement, and her eyes shone. \"The best I\r\never see!\" she whispered. \"I'm on, mate, if you know any more tricks\r\nlike that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaps,\" said Gerald confidently; \"hold out your hand.\" The woman held\r\nit out; and from nowhere, as it seemed, the apple appeared and was laid\r\non her hand. The apple was rather damp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"YOU'RE GETTING AT ME. LET'S SEE YOU DO A BIT OF\r\nCONJURING, SINCE YOU'RE SO CLEVER AN' ALL.\"]\r\n\r\nShe looked at it a moment, and then whispered: \"Come on! there's to be\r\nno one in it but just us two. But not in the tent. You take a pitch\r\nhere, 'longside the tent. It's worth twice the money in the open air.\"\r\n\r\n\"But people won't pay if they can see it all for nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for the first turn, but they will after--you see. And you'll have\r\nto do the patter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you lend me your shawl?\" Gerald asked. She unpinned it--it was a\r\nred and black plaid--and he spread it on the ground as he had seen\r\nIndian conjurers do, and seated himself cross-legged behind it.\r\n\r\n\"I mustn't have any one behind me, that's all,\" he said; and the woman\r\nhastily screened off a little enclosure for him by hanging old sacks to\r\ntwo of the guy-ropes of the tent. \"Now I'm ready,\" he said. The woman\r\ngot a drum from the inside of the tent and beat it. Quite soon a little\r\ncrowd had collected.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Gerald, \"I come from India, and I can do a\r\nconjuring entertainment the like of which you've never seen. When I see\r\ntwo shillings on the shawl I'll begin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say you will!\" said a bystander; and there were several short,\r\ndisagreeable laughs.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Gerald, \"if you can't afford two shillings between\r\nyou\"--there were about thirty people in the crowd by now--\"I say no\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nTwo or three pennies fell on the shawl, then a few more, then the fall\r\nof copper ceased.\r\n\r\n\"Ninepence,\" said Gerald. \"Well, I've got a generous nature. You'll get\r\nsuch a nine-pennyworth as you've never had before. I don't wish to\r\ndeceive you--I have an accomplice, but my accomplice is invisible.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd snorted.\r\n\r\n\"By the aid of that accomplice,\" Gerald went on, \"I will read any letter\r\nthat any of you may have in your pocket. If one of you will just step\r\nover the rope and stand beside me, my invisible accomplice will read\r\nthat letter over his shoulder.\"\r\n\r\nA man stepped forward, a ruddy-faced, horsy-looking person. He pulled a\r\nletter from his pocket and stood plain in the sight of all, in a place\r\nwhere every one saw that no one could see over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Now!\" said Gerald. There was a moment's pause. Then from quite the\r\nother side of the enclosure came a faint, far-away, sing-song voice. It\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"'SIR,--Yours of the fifteenth duly to hand. With regard to the mortgage\r\non your land, we regret our inability----'\"\r\n\r\n\"Stow it!\" cried the man, turning threateningly on Gerald.\r\n\r\nHe stepped out of the enclosure explaining that there was nothing of\r\nthat sort in his letter; but nobody believed him, and a buzz of\r\ninterested chatter began in the crowd, ceasing abruptly when Gerald\r\nbegan to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, laying the nine pennies down on the shawl, \"you keep\r\nyour eyes on those pennies, and one by one you'll see them disappear.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"STOW IT!\" CRIED THE MAN, TURNING THREATENINGLY ON\r\nGERALD.]\r\n\r\nAnd of course they did. Then one by one they were laid down again by\r\nthe invisible hand of Mabel. The crowd clapped loudly. \"Brayvo!\" \"That's\r\nsomething like!\" \"Show us another!\" cried the people in the front rank.\r\nAnd those behind pushed forward.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Gerald, \"you've seen what I can do, but I don't do any more\r\ntill I see five shillings on this carpet.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in two minutes seven-and-threepence lay there and Gerald did a\r\nlittle more conjuring.\r\n\r\nWhen the people in front didn't want to give any more money, Gerald\r\nasked them to stand back and let the others have a look in. I wish I had\r\ntime to tell you of all the tricks he did--the grass round his enclosure\r\nwas absolutely trampled off by the feet of the people who thronged to\r\nlook at him. There is really hardly any limit to the wonders you can do\r\nif you have an invisible accomplice. All sorts of things were made to\r\nmove about, apparently by themselves, and even to vanish--into the folds\r\nof Mabel's clothing. The woman stood by, looking more and more pleasant\r\nas she saw the money come tumbling in, and beating her shabby drum every\r\ntime Gerald stopped conjuring.\r\n\r\nThe news of the conjurer had spread all over the fair. The crowd was\r\nfrantic with admiration. The man who ran the cocoanut shies begged\r\nGerald to throw in his lot with him; the owner of the rifle gallery\r\noffered him free board and lodging and go shares; and a brisk, broad\r\nlady, in stiff black silk and a violet bonnet, tried to engage him for\r\nthe forthcoming Bazaar for Reformed Bandsmen.\r\n\r\nAnd all this time the others mingled with the crowd--quite unobserved,\r\nfor who could have eyes for any one but Gerald? It was getting quite\r\nlate, long past tea-time, and Gerald, who was getting very tired indeed,\r\nand was quite satisfied with his share of the money, was racking his\r\nbrains for a way to get out of it.\r\n\r\n\"How are we to hook it?\" he murmured, as Mabel made his cap disappear\r\nfrom his head by the simple process of taking it off and putting it in\r\nher pocket. \"They'll never let us get away. I didn't think of that\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me think!\" whispered Mabel; and next moment she said, close to his\r\near: \"Divide the money, and give her something for the shawl. Put the\r\nmoney on it and say....\" She told him what to say.\r\n\r\nGerald's pitch was in the shade of the tent; otherwise, of course, every\r\none would have seen the shadow of the invisible Mabel as she moved about\r\nmaking things vanish.\r\n\r\nGerald told the woman to divide the money, which she did honestly\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said, while the impatient crowd pressed closer and closer.\r\n\"I'll give you five bob for your shawl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seven-and-six,\" said the woman mechanically.\r\n\r\n\"Righto!\" said Gerald, putting his heavy share of the money in his\r\ntrouser pocket.\r\n\r\n\"This shawl will now disappear,\" he said, picking it up. He handed it to\r\nMabel, who put it on; and, of course, it disappeared. A roar of\r\napplause went up from the audience.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said, \"I come to the last trick of all. I shall take three\r\nsteps backward and vanish.\" He took three steps backward, Mabel wrapped\r\nthe invisible shawl round him, and--he did not vanish. The shawl, being\r\ninvisible, did not conceal him in the least.\r\n\r\n\"Yah!\" cried a boy's voice in the crowd. \"Look at 'im! 'E knows 'e can't\r\ndo it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could put you in my pocket,\" said Mabel. The crowd was\r\ncrowding closer. At any moment they might touch Mabel, and then anything\r\nmight happen--simply anything. Gerald took hold of his hair with both\r\nhands, as his way was when he was anxious or discouraged. Mabel, in\r\ninvisibility, wrung her hands, as people are said to do in books; that\r\nis, she clasped them and squeezed very tight.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she whispered suddenly, \"it's loose. I can get it off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--the ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, young master. Give us summat for our money,\" a farm labourer\r\nshouted.\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said Gerald. \"This time I really will vanish. Slip round into\r\nthe tent,\" he whispered to Mabel. \"Push the ring under the canvas. Then\r\nslip out at the back and join the others. When I see you with them I'll\r\ndisappear. Go slow, and I'll catch you up.\"\r\n\r\n= = = = =\r\n\r\n\"It's me,\" said a pale and obvious Mabel in the ear of Kathleen. \"He's\r\ngot the ring; come on, before the crowd begins to scatter.\"\r\n\r\nAs they went out of the gate they heard a roar of surprise and annoyance\r\nrise from the crowd, and knew that this time Gerald really _had_\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThey had gone a mile before they heard footsteps on the road, and looked\r\nback. No one was to be seen.\r\n\r\nNext moment Gerald's voice spoke out of clear, empty-looking space.\r\n\r\n\"Halloa!\" it said gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"How horrid!\" cried Mabel; \"you did make me jump! Take the ring off. It\r\nmakes me feel quite creepy, you being nothing but a voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"So did you us,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Don't take it off yet,\" said Kathleen, who was really rather thoughtful\r\nfor her age, \"because you're still black, I suppose, and you might be\r\nrecognised, and eloped with by gipsies, so that you should go on doing\r\nconjuring for ever and ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should take it off,\" said Jimmy; \"it's no use going about invisible,\r\nand people seeing us with Mabel and saying we've eloped with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mabel impatiently, \"that would be simply silly. And,\r\nbesides, I want my ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not yours any more than ours, anyhow,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, stow it!\" said the weary voice of Gerald beside her. \"What's the\r\nuse of jawing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want the ring,\" said Mabel, rather mulishly.\r\n\r\n\"Want\"--the words came out of the still evening air--\"want must be your\r\nmaster. You can't have the ring. _I can't get it off!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE difficulty was not only that Gerald had got the ring on and couldn't\r\nget it off, and was therefore invisible, but that Mabel, who had been\r\ninvisible and therefore possible to be smuggled into the house, was now\r\nplain to be seen and impossible for smuggling purposes.\r\n\r\nThe children would have not only to account for the apparent absence of\r\none of themselves, but for the obvious presence of a perfect stranger.\r\n\r\n\"I can't go back to aunt. I can't and I won't,\" said Mabel firmly, \"not\r\nif I was visible twenty times over.\"\r\n\r\n\"She'd smell a rat if you did.\" Gerald owned--\"about the motor-car, I\r\nmean, and the adopting lady. And what we're to say to Mademoiselle about\r\nyou----!\" He tugged at the ring.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you told the truth,\" said Mabel meaningly.\r\n\r\n\"She wouldn't believe it,\" said Cathy; \"or, if she did, she'd go stark,\r\nstaring, raving mad.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Gerald's voice, \"we daren't _tell_ her. But she's really\r\nrather decent. Let's ask her to let you stay the night because it's too\r\nlate for you to get home.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" said Jimmy, \"but what about you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall go to bed,\" said Gerald, \"with a bad headache. Oh, _that's_ not\r\na lie! I've got one right enough. It's the sun, I think. I know\r\nblacklead attracts the concentration of the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"More likely the pears and the gingerbread,\" said Jimmy unkindly. \"Well,\r\nlet's get along. I wish it was me was invisible. I'd do something\r\ndifferent from going to bed with a silly headache, I know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you do?\" asked the voice of Gerald just behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Do keep in one place, you silly cuckoo!\" said Jimmy. \"You make me feel\r\nall jumpy.\" He had indeed jumped rather violently. \"Here, walk between\r\nCathy and me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What _would_ you do?\" repeated Gerald, from that apparently unoccupied\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\"I'd be a burglar,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\nCathy and Mabel in one breath reminded him how wrong burgling was, and\r\nJimmy replied:\r\n\r\n\"Well, then--a detective.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's got to be something to detect before you can begin\r\ndetectiving,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"Detectives don't always detect things,\" said Jimmy, very truly. \"If I\r\ncouldn't be any other kind I'd be a baffled detective. You could be one\r\nall right, and have no end of larks just the same. Why don't you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's exactly what I _am_ going to do,\" said Gerald. \"We'll go round by\r\nthe police-station and see what they've got in the way of crimes.\"\r\n\r\nThey did, and read the notices on the board outside. Two dogs had been\r\nlost, a purse, and a portfolio of papers \"of no value to any but the\r\nowner.\" Also Houghton Grange had been broken into and a quantity of\r\nsilver plate stolen. \"Twenty pounds reward offered for any information\r\nthat may lead to the recovery of the missing property.\"\r\n\r\n\"That burglary's my lay,\" said Gerald; \"I'll detect that. Here comes\r\nJohnson,\" he added; \"he's going off duty. Ask him about it.\" The fell\r\ndetective, being invisible, was unable to pump the constable, but the\r\nyoung brother of our hero made the inquiries in quite a creditable\r\nmanner. \"Be creditable, Jimmy.\"\r\n\r\nJimmy hailed the constable.\r\n\r\n\"Halloa, Johnson!\" he said.\r\n\r\nAnd Johnson replied: \"Halloa, young shaver!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shaver yourself!\" said Jimmy, but without malice.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing this time of night?\" the constable asked jocosely.\r\n\"All the dicky birds is gone to their little nesteses.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've been to the fair,\" said Kathleen. \"There was a conjurer there. I\r\nwish you could have seen him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heard about him,\" said Johnson; \"all fake, you know. The quickness of\r\nthe 'and deceives the hi.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is fame. Gerald, standing in the shadow, jingled the loose money in\r\nhis pocket to console himself.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" the policeman asked quickly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WHAT'S THAT?\" THE POLICEMAN ASKED QUICKLY.]\r\n\r\n\"Our money jingling,\" said Jimmy, with perfect truth.\r\n\r\n\"It's well to be some people,\" Johnson remarked; \"wish I'd got my\r\npockets full to jingle with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why haven't you?\" asked Mabel. \"Why don't you get that twenty\r\npounds reward?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you why I don't. Because in this 'ere realm of liberty, and\r\nBritannia ruling the waves, you aint allowed to arrest a chap on\r\nsuspicion, even if you know puffickly well who done the job.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a shame!\" said Jimmy warmly. \"And who _do_ you think did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think--I know.\" Johnson's voice was ponderous as his boots.\r\n\"It's a man what's known to the police on account of a heap o' crimes\r\nhe's done, but we never can't bring it 'ome to 'im, nor yet get\r\nsufficient evidence to convict.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jimmy, \"when I've left school I'll come to you and be\r\napprenticed, and be a detective. Just now I think we'd better get home\r\nand detect our supper. Good-night!\"\r\n\r\nThey watched the policeman's broad form disappear through the swing door\r\nof the police-station; and as it settled itself into quiet again the\r\nvoice of Gerald was heard complaining bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"You've no more brains than a halfpenny bun,\" he said: \"no details about\r\nhow and when the silver was taken.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he told us he knew,\" Jimmy urged.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's all you've got out of him. A silly policeman's silly idea.\r\nGo home and detect your precious supper! It's all you're fit for.\"\r\n\r\n\"What'll you do about supper?\" Mabel asked.\r\n\r\n\"Buns!\" said Gerald, \"halfpenny buns. They'll make me think of my dear\r\nlittle brother and sister. Perhaps you've got enough sense to buy buns?\r\nI can't go into a shop in this state.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you be so disagreeable,\" said Mabel with spirit. \"We did our\r\nbest. If I were Cathy you should whistle for your nasty buns.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you were Cathy the gallant young detective would have left home long\r\nago. Better the cabin of a tramp steamer than the best family mansion\r\nthat's got a brawling sister in it,\" said Gerald. \"You're a bit of an\r\noutsider at present, my gentle maiden. Jimmy and Cathy know well enough\r\nwhen their bold leader is chaffing and when he isn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not when we can't see your face we don't,\" said Cathy, in tones of\r\nrelief. \"I really thought you were in a flaring wax, and so did Jimmy,\r\ndidn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, rot!\" said Gerald. \"Come on! This way to the bun shop.\"\r\n\r\nThey went. And it was while Cathy and Jimmy were in the shop and the\r\nothers were gazing through the glass at the jam tarts and Swiss rolls\r\nand Victoria sandwiches and Bath buns under the spread yellow muslin in\r\nthe window, that Gerald discoursed in Mabel's ear of the plans and\r\nhopes of one entering on a detective career.\r\n\r\n\"I shall keep my eyes open to-night, I can tell you,\" he began. \"I shall\r\nkeep my eyes skinned, and no jolly error. The invisible detective may\r\nnot only find out about the purse and the silver, but detect some crime\r\nthat isn't even done yet. And I shall hang about until I see some\r\nsuspicious-looking characters leave the town, and follow them furtively\r\nand catch them red-handed, with their hands full of priceless jewels,\r\nand hand them over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried Mabel, so sharply and suddenly that Gerald was roused from\r\nhis dream to express sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"Pain?\" he said quite kindly. \"It's the apples--they _were_ rather\r\nhard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's not that,\" said Mabel very earnestly. \"Oh, how awful! I never\r\nthought of that before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never thought of _what_?\" Gerald asked impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"The window.\"\r\n\r\n\"What window?\"\r\n\r\n\"The panelled-room window. At home, you know--at the castle. That\r\nsettles it--I _must_ go home. We left it open and the shutters as well,\r\nand all the jewels and things there. Auntie'll never go in; she never\r\ndoes. That settles it; I _must_ go home--now--this minute.\"\r\n\r\nHere the others issued from the shop, bun-bearing, and the situation was\r\nhastily explained to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I _MUST_ GO HOME--NOW--THIS MINUTE.\"]\r\n\r\n\"So you see I must go,\" Mabel ended.\r\n\r\nAnd Kathleen agreed that she must.\r\n\r\nBut Jimmy said he didn't see what good it would do. \"Because the key's\r\ninside the door, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"She _will_ be cross,\" said Mabel sadly. \"She'll have to get the\r\ngardeners to get a ladder and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Hooray!\" said Gerald. \"Here's me! Nobler and more secret than gardeners\r\nor ladders was the invisible Jerry. I'll climb in at the window--it's\r\nall ivy, I know I could--and shut the window and the shutters all\r\nsereno, put the key back on the nail, and slip out unperceived the back\r\nway, threading my way through the maze of unconscious retainers.\r\nThere'll be plenty of time. I don't suppose burglars begin their fell\r\nwork until the night is far advanced.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't you be afraid?\" Mabel asked. \"Will it be safe--suppose you were\r\ncaught?\"\r\n\r\n\"As houses. I can't be,\" Gerald answered, and wondered that the question\r\ncame from Mabel and not from Kathleen, who was usually inclined to fuss\r\na little annoyingly about the danger and folly of adventures.\r\n\r\nBut all Kathleen said was, \"Well, goodbye: we'll come and see you\r\nto-morrow, Mabel. The floral temple at half-past ten. I hope you won't\r\nget into an awful row about the motor-car lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's detect our supper now,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Gerald a little bitterly. It is hard to enter on an\r\nadventure like this and to find the sympathetic interest of years\r\nsuddenly cut off at the meter, as it were. Gerald felt that he ought, at\r\na time like this, to have been the centre of interest. And he wasn't.\r\nThey could actually talk about supper. Well, let them. He didn't care!\r\nHe spoke with sharp sternness: \"Leave the pantry window undone for me to\r\nget in by when I've done my detecting. Come on, Mabel.\" He caught her\r\nhand. \"Bags I the buns, though,\" he added, by a happy afterthought, and\r\nsnatching the bag, pressed it on Mabel, and the sound of four boots\r\nechoed on the pavement of the High Street as the outlines of the running\r\nMabel grew small with distance.\r\n\r\n= = = = =\r\n\r\nMademoiselle was in the drawing-room. She was sitting by the window in\r\nthe waning light reading letters.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, _vous voici_!\" she said unintelligibly. \"You are again late; and my\r\nlittle Gerald, where is he?\"\r\n\r\nThis was an awful moment. Jimmy's detective scheme had not included any\r\nanswer to this inevitable question. The silence was unbroken till Jimmy\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"He _said_ he was going to bed because he had a headache.\" And this, of\r\ncourse, was true.\r\n\r\n\"This poor Gerald!\" said Mademoiselle. \"Is it that I should mount him\r\nsome supper?\"\r\n\r\n\"He never eats anything when he's got one of his headaches,\" Kathleen\r\nsaid. And this also was the truth.\r\n\r\nJimmy and Kathleen went to bed, wholly untroubled by anxiety about their\r\nbrother, and Mademoiselle pulled out the bundle of letters and read them\r\namid the ruins of the simple supper.\r\n\r\n= = = = =\r\n\r\n\"It is ripping being out late like this,\" said Gerald through the soft\r\nsummer dusk.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mabel, a solitary-looking figure plodding along the\r\nhigh-road. \"I do hope auntie won't be _very_ furious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have another bun,\" suggested Gerald kindly, and a sociable munching\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nIt was the aunt herself who opened to a very pale and trembling Mabel\r\nthe door which is appointed for the entrances and exits of the domestic\r\nstaff at Yalding Towers. She looked over Mabel's head first, as if she\r\nexpected to see some one taller. Then a very small voice said:--\r\n\r\n\"Aunt!\"\r\n\r\nThe aunt started back, then made a step towards Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"You naughty, naughty girl!\" she cried angrily; \"how could you give me\r\nsuch a fright? I've a good mind to keep you in bed for a week for this,\r\nmiss. Oh, Mabel, thank Heaven you're safe!\" And with that the aunt's\r\narms went round Mabel and Mabel's round the aunt in such a hug as they\r\nhad never met in before.\r\n\r\n\"But you didn't seem to care a bit this morning,\" said Mabel, when she\r\nhad realised that her aunt really had been anxious, really was glad to\r\nhave her safe home again.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was there listening. Don't be angry, auntie.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel as if I never could be angry with you again, now I've got you\r\nsafe,\" said the aunt surprisingly.\r\n\r\n\"But how was it?\" Mabel asked.\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" said the aunt impressively, \"I've been in a sort of trance. I\r\nthink I must be going to be ill. I've always been fond of you, but I\r\ndidn't want to spoil you. But yesterday, about half-past three, I was\r\ntalking about you to Mr. Lewson, at the fair, and quite suddenly I felt\r\nas if you didn't matter at all. And I felt the same when I got your\r\nletter and when those children came. And to-day in the middle of tea I\r\nsuddenly woke up and realised that you were gone. It was awful. I think\r\nI must be going to be ill. Oh, Mabel, why did you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was--a joke,\" said Mabel feebly. And then the two went in and the\r\ndoor was shut.\r\n\r\n\"That's most uncommon odd,\" said Gerald, outside; \"looks like more magic\r\nto me. I don't feel as if we'd got to the bottom of this yet, by any\r\nmanner of means. There's more about this castle than meets the eye.\"\r\n\r\nThere certainly was. For this castle happened to be--but it would not be\r\nfair to Gerald to tell you more about it than he knew on that night when\r\nhe went alone and invisible through the shadowy great grounds of it to\r\nlook for the open window of the panelled room. He knew that night no\r\nmore than I have told you; but as he went along the dewy lawns and\r\nthrough the groups of shrubs and trees, where pools lay like giant\r\nlooking-glasses reflecting the quiet stars, and the white limbs of\r\nstatues gleamed against a background of shadow, he began to feel--well,\r\nnot excited, not surprised, not anxious, but--different.\r\n\r\nThe incident of the invisible Princess had surprised, the incident of\r\nthe conjuring had excited, and the sudden decision to be a detective had\r\nbrought its own anxieties; but all these happenings, though wonderful\r\nand unusual, had seemed to be, after all, inside the circle of possible\r\nthings--wonderful as the chemical experiments are where two liquids\r\npoured together make fire, surprising as legerdemain, thrilling as a\r\njuggler's display, but nothing more. Only now a new feeling came to him\r\nas he walked through those gardens; by day those gardens were like\r\ndreams, at night they were like visions. He could not see his feet as he\r\nwalked, but he saw the movement of the dewy grass-blades that his feet\r\ndisplaced. And he had that extraordinary feeling so difficult to\r\ndescribe, and yet so real and so unforgettable--the feeling that he was\r\nin another world, that had covered up and hidden the old world as a\r\ncarpet covers a floor. The floor was there all right, underneath, but\r\nwhat he walked on was the carpet that covered it--and that carpet was\r\ndrenched in magic, as the turf was drenched in dew.\r\n\r\nThe feeling was very wonderful; perhaps you will feel it some day. There\r\nare still some places in the world where it can be felt, but they grow\r\nfewer every year.\r\n\r\nThe enchantment of the garden held him.\r\n\r\n\"I'll not go in yet,\" he told himself; \"it's too early. And perhaps I\r\nshall never be here at night again. I suppose it _is_ the night that\r\nmakes everything look so different.\"\r\n\r\nSomething white moved under a weeping willow; white hands parted the\r\nlong, rustling leaves. A white figure came out, a creature with horns\r\nand goat's legs and the head and arms of a boy. And Gerald was not\r\nafraid. That was the most wonderful thing of all, though he would never\r\nhave owned it. The white thing stretched its limbs, rolled on the grass,\r\nrighted itself, and frisked away across the lawn. Still something white\r\ngleamed under the willow; three steps nearer and Gerald saw that it was\r\nthe pedestal of a statue--empty.\r\n\r\n\"They come alive,\" he said; and another white shape came out of the\r\nTemple of Flora and disappeared in the laurels. \"The statues come\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MOVING STONE BEAST.]\r\n\r\nThere was a crunching of the little stones in the gravel of the drive.\r\nSomething enormously long and darkly grey came crawling towards him,\r\nslowly, heavily. The moon came out just in time to show its shape. It\r\nwas one of those great lizards that you see at the Crystal Palace,\r\nmade in stone, of the same awful size which they were millions of years\r\nago when they were masters of the world, before Man was.\r\n\r\n\"It can't see me,\" said Gerald. \"I am not afraid. _It's_ come to life,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\nAs it writhed past him he reached out a hand and touched the side of its\r\ngigantic tail. It was of stone. It had not \"come alive,\" as he had\r\nfancied, but _was_ alive in its stone. It turned, however, at the touch;\r\nbut Gerald also had turned, and was running with all his speed towards\r\nthe house. Because at that stony touch Fear had come into the garden and\r\nalmost caught him. It was Fear that he ran from, and not the moving\r\nstone beast.\r\n\r\nHe stood panting under the fifth window; when he had climbed to the\r\nwindow-ledge by the twisted ivy that clung to the wall, he looked back\r\nover the grey slope--there was a splashing at the fish-pool that had\r\nmirrored the stars--the shape of the great stone beast was wallowing in\r\nthe shallows among the lily-pads.\r\n\r\nOnce inside the room, Gerald turned for another look. The fish-pond lay\r\nstill and dark, reflecting the moon. Through a gap in the drooping\r\nwillow the moonlight fell on a statue that stood calm and motionless on\r\nits pedestal. Everything was in its place now in the garden. Nothing\r\nmoved or stirred.\r\n\r\n\"How extraordinarily rum!\" said Gerald. \"I shouldn't have thought you\r\n_could_ go to sleep walking through a garden and dream--like that.\"\r\n\r\nHe shut the window, lit a match, and closed the shutters. Another match\r\nshowed him the door. He turned the key, went out, locked the door again,\r\nhung the key on its usual nail, and crept to the end of the passage.\r\nHere he waited, safe in his invisibility, till the dazzle of the matches\r\nshould have gone from his eyes, and he be once more able to find his way\r\nby the moonlight that fell in bright patches on the floor through the\r\nbarred, unshuttered windows of the hall.\r\n\r\n\"Wonder where the kitchen is,\" said Gerald. He had quite forgotten that\r\nhe was a detective. He was only anxious to get home and tell the others\r\nabout that extraordinarily odd dream that he had had in the gardens. \"I\r\nsuppose it doesn't matter _what_ doors I open. I'm invisible all right\r\nstill, I suppose? Yes; can't see my hand before my face.\" He held up a\r\nhand for the purpose. \"Here goes!\"\r\n\r\nHe opened many doors, wandered into long rooms with furniture dressed in\r\nbrown holland covers that looked white in that strange light, rooms with\r\nchandeliers hanging in big bags from the high ceilings, rooms whose\r\nwalls were alive with pictures, rooms whose walls were deadened with\r\nrows on rows of old books, state bedrooms in whose great plumed\r\nfour-posters Queen Elizabeth had no doubt slept. (That Queen, by the\r\nway, must have been very little at home, for she seems to have slept in\r\nevery old house in England.) But he could not find the kitchen. At last\r\na door opened on stone steps that went up--there was a narrow stone\r\npassage--steps that went down--a door with a light under it. It was,\r\nsomehow, difficult to put out one's hand to that door and open it.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Gerald told himself; \"don't be an ass! Are you invisible, or\r\naren't you?\"\r\n\r\nThen he opened the door, and some one inside said something in a sudden\r\nrough growl.\r\n\r\nGerald stood back, flattened against the wall, as a man sprang to the\r\ndoorway and flashed a lantern into the passage.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said the man, with almost a sob of relief. \"It was only the\r\ndoor swung open, it's that heavy--that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blow the door!\" said another growling voice; \"blessed if I didn't think\r\nit was a fair cop that time.\"\r\n\r\nThey closed the door again. Gerald did not mind. In fact, he rather\r\npreferred that it should be so. He didn't like the look of those men.\r\nThere was an air of threat about them. In their presence even\r\ninvisibility seemed too thin a disguise. And Gerald had seen as much as\r\nhe wanted to see. He had seen that he had been right about the gang. By\r\nwonderful luck--beginner's luck, a card-player would have told him--he\r\nhad discovered a burglary on the very first night of his detective\r\ncareer. The men were taking silver out of two great chests, wrapping it\r\nin rags, and packing it in baize sacks. The door of the room was of iron\r\nsix inches thick. It was, in fact, the strong-room, and these men had\r\npicked the lock. The tools they had done it with lay on the floor, on a\r\nneat cloth roll, such as wood-carvers keep their chisels in.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up!\" Gerald heard. \"You needn't take all night over it.\"\r\n\r\nThe silver rattled slightly. \"You're a rattling of them trays like\r\nbloomin' castanets,\" said the gruffest voice. Gerald turned and went\r\naway, very carefully and very quickly. And it is a most curious thing\r\nthat, though he couldn't find the way to the servants' wing when he had\r\nnothing else to think of, yet now, with his mind full, so to speak, of\r\nsilver forks and silver cups, and the question of who might be coming\r\nafter him down those twisting passages, he went straight as an arrow to\r\nthe door that led from the hall to the place he wanted to get to.\r\n\r\nAs he went the happenings took words in his mind.\r\n\r\n\"The fortunate detective,\" he told himself, \"having succeeded beyond his\r\nwildest dreams, himself left the spot in search of assistance.\"\r\n\r\nBut what assistance? There were, no doubt, men in the house, also the\r\naunt; but he could not warn them. He was too hopelessly invisible to\r\ncarry any weight with strangers. The assistance of Mabel would not be of\r\nmuch value. The police? Before they could be got--and the getting of\r\nthem presented difficulties--the burglars would have cleared away with\r\ntheir sacks of silver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MEN WERE TAKING SILVER OUT OF TWO GREAT CHESTS.]\r\n\r\nGerald stopped and thought hard; he held his head with both hands to do\r\nit. You know the way--the same as you sometimes do for simple\r\nequations or the dates of the battles of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThen with pencil, note-book, a window-ledge, and all the cleverness he\r\ncould find at the moment, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n          \"_You know the room where the silver is. Burglars\r\n          are burgling it, the thick door is picked. Send a\r\n          man for police. I will follow the burglars if they\r\n          get away ere police arrive on the spot._\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment, and ended--\r\n\r\n          \"_From a Friend--this is not a sell._\"\r\n\r\nThis letter, tied tightly round a stone by means of a shoe-lace,\r\nthundered through the window of the room where Mabel and her aunt, in\r\nthe ardour of reunion, were enjoying a supper of unusual charm--stewed\r\nplums, cream, sponge-cakes, custard in cups, and cold bread-and-butter\r\npudding.\r\n\r\nGerald, in hungry invisibility, looked wistfully at the supper before he\r\nthrew the stone. He waited till the shrieks had died away, saw the stone\r\npicked up, the warning letter read.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said the aunt, growing calmer. \"How wicked! Of course it's a\r\nhoax.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! do send for the police, like he says,\" wailed Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"Like who says?\" snapped the aunt.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever it is,\" Mabel moaned.\r\n\r\n\"Send for the police at once,\" said Gerald, outside, in the manliest\r\nvoice he could find.\r\n\r\n\"You'll only blame yourself if you don't. I can't do any more for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I'll set the dogs on you!\" cried the aunt.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, auntie, _don't_!\" Mabel was dancing with agitation. \"It's true--I\r\nknow it's true. Do--do wake Bates!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe a word of it,\" said the aunt. No more did Bates when,\r\nowing to Mabel's persistent worryings, he was awakened. But when he had\r\nseen the paper, and had to choose whether he'd go to the strong-room and\r\nsee that there really wasn't anything to believe or go for the police on\r\nhis bicycle, he chose the latter course.\r\n\r\nWhen the police arrived the strong-room door stood ajar, and the silver,\r\nor as much of it as three men could carry, was gone.\r\n\r\nGerald's note-book and pencil came into play again later on that night.\r\nIt was five in the morning before he crept into bed, tired out and cold\r\nas a stone.\r\n\r\n= = = = =\r\n\r\n\"Master Gerald!\"--it was Eliza's voice in his ears--\"it's seven o'clock\r\nand another fine day, and there's been another burglary---- My cats\r\nalive!\" she screamed, as she drew up the blind and turned towards the\r\nbed; \"look at his bed, all crocked with black, and him not there! Oh,\r\nJimminy!\" It was a scream this time. Kathleen came running from her\r\nroom; Jimmy sat up in his bed and rubbed his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever is it?\" Kathleen cried.\r\n\r\n\"I dunno when I 'ad such a turn.\" Eliza sat down heavily on a box as\r\nshe spoke. \"First thing his bed all empty and black as the chimley back,\r\nand him not in it, and then when I looks again he _is_ in it all the\r\ntime. I must be going silly. I thought as much when I heard them\r\nhaunting angel voices yesterday morning. But I'll tell Mam'selle of you,\r\nmy lad, with your tricks, you may rely on that. Blacking yourself all\r\nover like a dirty nigger and crocking up your clean sheets and\r\npillow-cases. It's going back of beyond, this is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Gerald slowly; \"I'm going to tell you something.\"\r\n\r\nEliza simply snorted, and that was rude of her; but then, she had had a\r\nshock and had not got over it.\r\n\r\n\"Can you keep a secret?\" asked Gerald, very earnest through the grey of\r\nhis partly rubbed-off blacklead.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Eliza.\r\n\r\n\"Then keep it and I'll give you two bob.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what was you going to tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That. About the two bob and the secret. And you keep your mouth shut.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't ought to take it,\" said Eliza, holding out her hand eagerly.\r\n\"Now you get up, and mind you wash all the corners, Master Gerald.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm so glad you're safe,\" said Kathleen, when Eliza had gone.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't seem to care much last night,\" said Gerald coldly.\r\n\r\n\"I can't think how I let you go. I didn't care last night. But when I\r\nwoke this morning and remembered!\"\r\n\r\n\"There, that'll do--it'll come off on you,\" said Gerald through the\r\nreckless hugging of his sister.\r\n\r\n\"How did you get visible?\" Jimmy asked.\r\n\r\n\"It just happened when she called me--the ring came off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us all about everything,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" said Gerald mysteriously.\r\n\r\n= = = = =\r\n\r\n\"Where's the ring?\" Jimmy asked after breakfast. \"_I_ want to have a try\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I forgot it,\" said Gerald; \"I expect it's in the bed somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nBut it wasn't. Eliza had made the bed.\r\n\r\n\"I'll swear there aint no ring there,\" she said. \"I should 'a' seen it\r\nif there had 'a' been.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SEARCH and research proving vain,\" said Gerald, when every corner of\r\nthe bedroom had been turned out and the ring had not been found, \"the\r\nnoble detective hero of our tale remarked that he would have other fish\r\nto fry in half a jiff, and if the rest of you want to hear about last\r\nnight....\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's keep it till we get to Mabel,\" said Kathleen heroically.\r\n\r\n\"The assignation was ten-thirty, wasn't it? Why shouldn't Gerald gas as\r\nwe go along? I don't suppose anything very much happened, anyhow.\" This,\r\nof course, was Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"That shows,\" remarked Gerald sweetly, \"how much _you_ know. The\r\nmelancholy Mabel will await the tryst without success, as far as this\r\none is concerned. 'Fish, fish, other fish--other fish I fry!'\" he\r\nwarbled to the tune of \"Cherry Ripe,\" till Kathleen could have pinched\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nJimmy turned coldly away, remarking, \"When you've quite done.\"\r\n\r\nBut Gerald went on singing--\r\n\r\n          \"'Where the lips of Johnson smile,\r\n            There's the land of Cherry Isle.\r\n            Other fish, other fish,\r\n            Fish I fry.\r\n            Stately Johnson, come and buy!'\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you,\" asked Kathleen, \"be so aggravating?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Gerald, returning to prose. \"Want of sleep or\r\nintoxication--of success, I mean. Come where no one can hear us.\r\n\r\n          \"Oh, come to some island where no one can hear,\r\n           And beware of the keyhole that's glued to an ear,\"\r\n\r\nhe whispered, opened the door suddenly, and there, sure enough, was\r\nEliza, stooping without. She flicked feebly at the wainscot with a\r\nduster, but concealment was vain.\r\n\r\n\"You know what listeners never hear,\" said Jimmy severely.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't, then--so there!\" said Eliza, whose listening ears were\r\ncrimson. So they passed out, and up the High Street, to sit on the\r\nchurchyard wall and dangle their legs. And all the way Gerald's lips\r\nwere shut into a thin, obstinate line.\r\n\r\n\"_Now_,\" said Kathleen. \"Oh, Jerry, don't be a goat! I'm simply dying to\r\nhear what happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's better,\" said Gerald, and he told his story. As he told it some\r\nof the white mystery and magic of the moonlit gardens got into his voice\r\nand his words, so that when he told of the statues that came alive, and\r\nthe great beast that was alive through all its stone, Kathleen thrilled\r\nresponsive, clutching his arm, and even Jimmy ceased to kick the wall\r\nwith his boot heels, and listened open-mouthed.\r\n\r\nThen came the thrilling tale of the burglars, and the warning letter\r\nflung into the peaceful company of Mabel, her aunt, and the\r\nbread-and-butter pudding. Gerald told the story with the greatest\r\nenjoyment and such fulness of detail that the church clock chimed\r\nhalf-past eleven as he said, \"Having done all that human agency could\r\ndo, and further help being despaired of, our gallant young detective----\r\nHullo, there's Mabel!\"\r\n\r\nThere was. The tail-board of a cart shed her almost at their feet.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't wait any longer,\" she explained, \"when you didn't come. And\r\nI got a lift. Has anything more happened? The burglars had gone when\r\nBates got to the strong-room.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say all that wheeze is _real_?\" Jimmy asked.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's real,\" said Kathleen. \"Go on, Jerry. He's just got to\r\nwhere he threw the stone into your bread-and-butter pudding, Mabel. Go\r\non.\"\r\n\r\nMabel climbed on to the wall. \"You've got visible again quicker than I\r\ndid,\" she said.\r\n\r\nGerald nodded and resumed:\r\n\r\n\"Our story must be told in as few words as possible, owing to the\r\nfish-frying taking place at twelve, and it's past the half-hour now.\r\nHaving left his missive to do its warning work, Gerald de Sherlock\r\nHolmes sped back, wrapped in invisibility, to the spot where by the\r\nlight of their dark-lanterns the burglars were still--still burgling\r\nwith the utmost punctuality and despatch. I didn't see any sense in\r\nrunning into danger, so I just waited outside the passage where the\r\nsteps are--you know?\"\r\n\r\nMabel nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Presently they came out, very cautiously, of course, and looked about\r\nthem. They didn't see me--so deeming themselves unobserved they passed\r\nin silent Indian file along the passage--one of the sacks of silver\r\ngrazed my front part--and out into the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"But which way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Through the little looking-glass room where you looked at yourself when\r\nyou were invisible. The hero followed swiftly on his invisible\r\ntennis-shoes. The three miscreants instantly sought the shelter of the\r\ngroves and passed stealthily among the rhododendrons and across the\r\npark, and\"--his voice dropped and he looked straight before him at the\r\npinky convolvulus netting a heap of stones beyond the white dust of the\r\nroad--\"the stone things that come alive, they kept looking out from\r\nbetween bushes and under trees--and _I_ saw them all right, but they\r\ndidn't see me. They saw the burglars though, right enough; but the\r\nburglars couldn't see them. Rum, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The stone things?\" Mabel had to have them explained to her.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ never saw them come alive,\" she said, \"and I've been in the gardens\r\nin the evening as often as often.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ saw them,\" said Gerald stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know,\" Mabel hastened to put herself right with him: \"what I\r\nmean to say is I shouldn't wonder if they're only visible when you're\r\n_in_visible--the liveness of them, I mean, not the stoniness.\"\r\n\r\nGerald understood, and I'm sure I hope you do.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't wonder if you're right,\" he said. \"The castle garden's\r\nenchanted right enough; but what I should like to know is _how_ and why.\r\nI say, come on, I've got to catch Johnson before twelve. We'll walk as\r\nfar as the market and then we'll have to run for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But go on with the adventure,\" said Mabel. \"You can talk as we go. Oh,\r\ndo--it is so awfully thrilling!\"\r\n\r\nThis pleased Gerald, of course.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I just followed, you know, like in a dream, and they got out the\r\ncavy way--you know, where we got in--and I jolly well thought I'd lost\r\nthem; I had to wait till they'd moved off down the road so that they\r\nshouldn't hear me rattling the stones, and I had to tear to catch them\r\nup. I took my shoes off--I expect my stockings are done for. And I\r\nfollowed and followed and followed and they went through the place where\r\nthe poor people live, and right down to the river. And---- I say, we\r\nmust run for it.\"\r\n\r\nSo the story stopped and the running began.\r\n\r\nThey caught Johnson in his own back-yard washing at a bench against his\r\nown back-door.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Johnson,\" Gerald said, \"what'll you give me if I put you up\r\nto winning that fifty pounds reward?\"\r\n\r\n\"Halves,\" said Johnson promptly, \"and a clout 'longside your head if you\r\nwas coming any of your nonsense over me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's _not_ nonsense,\" said Gerald very impressively. \"If you'll let us\r\nin I'll tell you all about it. And when you've caught the burglars and\r\ngot the swag back you just give me a quid for luck. I won't ask for\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along in, then,\" said Johnson, \"if the young ladies'll excuse the\r\ntowel. But I bet you _do_ want something more off of me. Else why not\r\nclaim the reward yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Great is the wisdom of Johnson--he speaks winged words.\" The children\r\nwere all in the cottage now, and the door was shut. \"I want you never to\r\nlet on who told you. Let them think it was your own unaided pluck and\r\nfarsightedness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit you down,\" said Johnson, \"and if you're kidding you'd best send the\r\nlittle gells home afore I begin on you.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"LOOK HERE, JOHNSON,\" GERALD SAID, \"WHAT'LL YOU GIVE ME\r\nIF I PUT YOU UP TO WINNING THAT FIFTY POUNDS REWARD?\"]\r\n\r\n\"I am not kidding,\" replied Gerald loftily, \"never less. And any one but\r\na policeman would see why I don't want any one to know it was me. I\r\nfound it out at dead of night, in a place where I wasn't supposed to be;\r\nand there'd be a beastly row if they found out at home about me being\r\nout nearly all night. _Now_ do you see, my bright-eyed daisy?\"\r\n\r\nJohnson was now too interested, as Jimmy said afterwards, to mind what\r\nsilly names he was called. He said he did see--and asked to see more.\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't you ask any questions, then. I'll tell you all it's good\r\nfor you to know. Last night about eleven I was at Yalding Towers. No--it\r\ndoesn't matter how I got there or what I got there for--and there was a\r\nwindow open and I got in, and there was a light. And it was in the\r\nstrong-room, and there were three men, putting silver in a bag.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it you give the warning, and they sent for the police?\" Johnson was\r\nleaning eagerly forward, a hand on each knee.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that was me. You can let them think it was you, if you like. You\r\nwere off duty, weren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was,\" said Johnson, \"in the arms of Murphy----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the police didn't come quick enough. But _I_ was there--a lonely\r\ndetective. And I followed them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did?\"\r\n\r\n\"And I saw them hide the booty and I know the other stuff from Houghton\r\nCourt's in the same place, and I heard them arrange about when to take\r\nit away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come and show me where,\" said Johnson, jumping up so quickly that his\r\nWindsor arm-chair fell over backwards, with a crack, on the red-brick\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" said Gerald calmly; \"if you go near the spot before the\r\nappointed time you'll find the silver, but you'll never catch the\r\nthieves.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right there.\" The policeman picked up his chair and sat down in\r\nit again. \"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's to be a motor to meet them in the lane beyond the\r\nboat-house by Sadler's Rents at one o'clock to-night. They'll get the\r\nthings out at half-past twelve and take them along in a boat. So now's\r\nyour chance to fill your pockets with chink and cover yourself with\r\nhonour and glory.\"\r\n\r\n\"So help me!\"--Johnson was pensive and doubtful still--\"so help me! you\r\n_couldn't_ have made all this up out of your head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I could. But I didn't. Now look here. It's the chance of your\r\nlifetime, Johnson! A quid for me, and a still tongue for you, and the\r\njob's done. Do you agree?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _I_ agree right enough,\" said Johnson. \"I _agree_. But if you're\r\ncoming any of your larks----\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you _see_ he isn't?\" Kathleen put in impatiently. \"He's not a\r\nliar--we none of us are.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you're not on, say so,\" said Gerald, \"and I'll find another\r\npoliceman with more sense.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could split about you being out all night,\" said Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"But you wouldn't be so ungentlemanly,\" said Mabel brightly. \"Don't you\r\nbe so unbelieving, when we're trying to do you a good turn.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I were you,\" Gerald advised, \"I'd go to the place where the silver\r\nis, with two other men. You could make a nice little ambush in the\r\nwood-yard--it's close there. And I'd have two or three more men up trees\r\nin the lane to wait for the motor-car.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have been in the force, you ought,\" said Johnson\r\nadmiringly; \"but s'pose it _was_ a hoax!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then you'd have made an ass of yourself--I don't suppose it ud be\r\nthe first time,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Are you on?\" said Gerald in haste. \"Hold your jaw, Jimmy, you idiot!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Yes_,\" said Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"Then when you're on duty you go down to the wood-yard, and the place\r\nwhere you see me blow my nose is _the_ place. The sacks are tied with\r\nstring to the posts under the water. You just stalk by in your dignified\r\nbeauty and make a note of the spot. That's where glory waits you, and\r\nwhen Fame elates you and you're a sergeant, please remember me.\"\r\n\r\nJohnson said he was blessed. He said it more than once, and then\r\nremarked that he was on, and added that he must be off that instant\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nJohnson's cottage lies just out of the town beyond the blacksmith's\r\nforge and the children had come to it through the wood. They went back\r\nthe same way, and then down through the town, and through its narrow,\r\nunsavoury streets to the towing-path by the timber yard. Here they ran\r\nalong the trunks of the big trees, peeped into the saw-pit, and--the men\r\nwere away at dinner and this was a favourite play place of every boy\r\nwithin miles--made themselves a see-saw with a fresh cut, sweet-smelling\r\npine plank and an elm-root.\r\n\r\n\"What a ripping place!\" said Mabel, breathless on the see-saw's end. \"I\r\nbelieve I like this better than pretending games or even magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" said Jimmy. \"Jerry, don't keep sniffing so--you'll have no\r\nnose left.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it,\" Gerald answered: \"I daren't use my hankey for fear\r\nJohnson's on the look-out somewhere unseen. I wish I'd thought of some\r\nother signal.\" Sniff! \"No, nor I shouldn't want to now if I hadn't got\r\nnot to. That's what's so rum. The moment I got down here and remembered\r\nwhat I'd said about the signal I began to have a cold--and---- Thank\r\ngoodness! here he is.\"\r\n\r\nThe children, with a fine air of unconcern, abandoned the see-saw.\r\n\r\n\"Follow my leader!\" Gerald cried, and ran along a barked oak trunk, the\r\nothers following. In and out and round about ran the file of children,\r\nover heaps of logs, under the jutting ends of piled planks, and just as\r\nthe policeman's heavy boots trod the towing-path Gerald halted at the\r\nend of a little landing-stage of rotten boards, with a rickety\r\nhandrail, cried \"Pax!\" and blew his nose with loud fervour.\r\n\r\n\"Morning,\" he said immediately.\r\n\r\n\"Morning,\" said Johnson. \"Got a cold, aint you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I shouldn't have a cold if I'd got boots like yours,\" returned\r\nGerald admiringly. \"Look at them. Any one ud know your fairy footstep a\r\nmile off. How do you ever get near enough to any one to arrest them?\" He\r\nskipped off the landing-stage, whispered as he passed Johnson, \"Courage,\r\npromptitude, and despatch. That's the place,\" and was off again, the\r\nactive leader of an active procession.\r\n\r\n\"We've brought a friend home to dinner,\" said Kathleen, when Eliza\r\nopened the door. \"Where's Mademoiselle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone to see Yalding Towers. To-day's show day, you know. An' just you\r\nhurry over your dinners. It's my afternoon out, and my gentleman friend\r\ndon't like it if he's kept waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, we'll eat like lightning,\" Gerald promised. \"Set another\r\nplace, there's an angel.\"\r\n\r\nThey kept their word. The dinner--it was minced veal and potatoes and\r\nrice-pudding, perhaps the dullest food in the world--was over in a\r\nquarter of an hour.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Mabel, when Eliza and a jug of hot water had disappeared\r\nup the stairs together, \"where's the ring? I ought to put it back.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GERALD HALTED AT THE END OF A LITTLE LANDING-STAGE OF\r\nROTTEN BOARDS.]\r\n\r\n\"I haven't had a turn yet,\" said Jimmy. \"When we find it Cathy and I\r\nought to have turns same as you and Gerald did.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you find it----?\" Mabel's pale face turned paler between her dark\r\nlocks.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very sorry--we're all very sorry,\" began Kathleen, and then the\r\nstory of the losing had to be told.\r\n\r\n\"You couldn't have looked properly,\" Mabel protested. \"It can't have\r\nvanished.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know what it can do--no more do we. It's no use getting your\r\nquills up, fair lady. Perhaps vanishing itself is just what it does do.\r\nYou see, it came off my hand in the bed. We looked everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you mind if _I_ looked?\" Mabel's eyes implored her little\r\nhostess. \"You see, if it's lost it's my fault. It's almost the same as\r\nstealing. That Johnson would say it was just the same. I know he would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's all look again,\" said Mabel, jumping up. \"We _were_ rather in a\r\nhurry this morning.\"\r\n\r\nSo they looked, and they looked. In the bed, under the bed, under the\r\ncarpet, under the furniture. They shook the curtains, they explored the\r\ncorners, and found dust and flue, but no ring. They looked, and they\r\nlooked. Everywhere they looked. Jimmy even looked fixedly at the\r\nceiling, as though he thought the ring might have bounced up there and\r\nstuck. But it hadn't.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Mabel at last, \"your housemaid must have stolen it. That's\r\nall. I shall tell her I think so.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she would have done it too, but at that moment the front door banged\r\nand they knew that Eliza had gone forth in all the glory of her best\r\nthings to meet her \"gentleman friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no use\"--Mabel was almost in tears; \"look here--will you leave me\r\nalone? Perhaps you others looking distracts me. And I'll go over every\r\ninch of the room by myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Respecting the emotion of their guest, the kindly charcoal-burners\r\nwithdrew,\" said Gerald. And they closed the door softly from the outside\r\non Mabel and her search.\r\n\r\nThey waited for her, of course--politeness demanded it, and besides,\r\nthey had to stay at home to let Mademoiselle in; though it was a\r\ndazzling day, and Jimmy had just remembered that Gerald's pockets were\r\nfull of the money earned at the fair, and that nothing had yet been\r\nbought with that money, except a few buns in which he had had no share.\r\nAnd of course they waited impatiently.\r\n\r\nIt seemed about an hour, and was really quite ten minutes, before they\r\nheard the bedroom door open and Mabel's feet on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\"She hasn't found it,\" Gerald said.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" Jimmy asked.\r\n\r\n\"The way she walks,\" said Gerald. You can, in fact, almost always tell\r\nwhether the thing has been found that people have gone to look for by\r\nthe sound of their feet as they return. Mabel's feet said \"No go,\" as\r\nplain as they could speak. And her face confirmed the cheerless news.\r\n\r\nA sudden and violent knocking at the back door prevented any one from\r\nhaving to be polite about how sorry they were, or fanciful about being\r\nsure the ring would turn up soon.\r\n\r\nAll the servants except Eliza were away on their holidays, so the\r\nchildren went together to open the door, because, as Gerald said, if it\r\nwas the baker they could buy a cake from him and eat it for dessert.\r\n\"That kind of dinner sort of _needs_ dessert,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the baker. When they opened the door they saw in the\r\npaved court where the pump is, and the dust-bin, and the water-butt, a\r\nyoung man, with his hat very much on one side, his mouth open under his\r\nfair bristly moustache, and his eyes as nearly round as human eyes can\r\nbe. He wore a suit of a bright mustard colour, a blue necktie, and a\r\ngoldish watch-chain across his waistcoat. His body was thrown back and\r\nhis right arm stretched out towards the door, and his expression was\r\nthat of a person who is being dragged somewhere against his will. He\r\nlooked so strange that Kathleen tried to shut the door in his face,\r\nmurmuring, \"Escaped insane.\" But the door would not close. There was\r\nsomething in the way.\r\n\r\n\"Leave go of me!\" said the young man.\r\n\r\n\"Ho yus! I'll leave go of you!\" It was the voice of Eliza--but no Eliza\r\ncould be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Who's got hold of you?\" asked Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"_She_ has, miss,\" replied the unhappy stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Who's she?\" asked Kathleen, to gain time, as she afterwards explained,\r\nfor she now knew well enough that what was keeping the door open was\r\nEliza's unseen foot.\r\n\r\n\"My fyongsay, miss. At least it sounds like her voice, and it feels like\r\nher bones, but something's come over me, miss, an' I can't see her.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what he keeps on saying,\" said Eliza's voice. \"E's my gentleman\r\nfriend; is 'e gone dotty, or is it me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both, I shouldn't wonder,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Eliza, \"you call yourself a man; you look me in the face and\r\nsay you can't see me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--I can't,\" said the wretched gentleman friend.\r\n\r\n\"If _I'd_ stolen a ring,\" said Gerald, looking at the sky, \"I should go\r\nindoors and be quiet, not stand at the back door and make an exhibition\r\nof myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much exhibition about her,\" whispered Jimmy; \"good old ring!\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't stolen _any_thing,\" said the gentleman friend. \"Here, you\r\nleave me be. It's my eyes has gone wrong. Leave go of me, d'ye hear?\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly his hand dropped and he staggered back against the water-butt.\r\nEliza had \"left go\" of him. She pushed past the children, shoving them\r\naside with her invisible elbows. Gerald caught her by the arm with one\r\nhand, felt for her ear with the other, and whispered. \"You stand still\r\nand don't say a word. If you do----well, what's to stop me from sending\r\nfor the police?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HE STAGGERED BACK AGAINST THE WATER-BUTT.]\r\n\r\nEliza did not know what there was to stop him. So she did as she was\r\ntold, and stood invisible and silent, save for a sort of blowing,\r\nsnorting noise peculiar to her when she was out of breath.\r\n\r\nThe mustard-coloured young man had recovered his balance, and stood\r\nlooking at the children with eyes, if possible, rounder than before.\r\n\r\n\"What _is_ it?\" he gasped feebly. \"What's up? What's it all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you don't know, I'm afraid we can't tell you,\" said Gerald politely.\r\n\r\n\"Have I been talking very strange-like?\" he asked, taking off his hat\r\nand passing his hand over his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"I hope I haven't said anything that wasn't good manners,\" he said\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Kathleen. \"You only said your _fiancee_ had hold of\r\nyour hand, and that you couldn't see her.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more can we,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"But I couldn't have dreamed it, and then come along here making a penny\r\nshow of myself like this, could I?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know best,\" said Gerald courteously.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" the mustard-coloured victim almost screamed, \"do you mean to tell\r\nme....\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean to tell you anything,\" said Gerald quite truly, \"but I'll\r\ngive you a bit of advice. You go home and lie down a bit and put a wet\r\nrag on your head. You'll be all right to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I haven't----\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ should,\" said Mabel; \"the sun's very hot, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel all right now,\" he said, \"but--well, I can only say I'm sorry,\r\nthat's all I can say. I've never been taken like this before, miss. I'm\r\nnot subject to it--don't you think that. But I could have sworn\r\nEliza---- Aint she gone out to meet me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eliza's indoors,\" said Mabel. \"She can't come out to meet anybody\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't tell her about me carrying on this way, will you, miss? It\r\nmight set her against me if she thought I was liable to fits, which I\r\nnever was from a child.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't tell Eliza anything about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you'll overlook the liberty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. We know you couldn't help it,\" said Kathleen. \"You go home\r\nand lie down. I'm sure you must need it. Good-afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-afternoon, I'm sure, miss,\" he said dreamily. \"All the same I can\r\nfeel the print of her finger-bones on my hand while I'm saying it. And\r\nyou won't let it get round to my boss--my employer I mean? Fits of all\r\nsorts are against a man in any trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no, it's all right--_goodbye_,\" said every one. And a silence\r\nfell as he went slowly round the water-butt and the green yard-gate shut\r\nbehind him. The silence was broken by Eliza.\r\n\r\n\"Give me up!\" she said. \"Give me up to break my heart in a prison cell!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden splash, and a round wet drop lay on the doorstep.\r\n\r\n\"Thunder shower,\" said Jimmy; but it was a tear from Eliza.\r\n\r\n\"Give me up,\" she went on, \"give me up\"--splash--\"but don't let me be\r\ntook here in the town where I'm known and respected\"--splash. \"I'll walk\r\nten miles to be took by a strange police--not Johnson as keeps company\r\nwith my own cousin\"--splash. \"But I do thank you for one thing. You\r\ndidn't tell Elf as I'd stolen the ring. And I didn't\"--splash--\"I only\r\nsort of borrowed it, it being my day out, and my gentleman friend such a\r\ntoff, like you can see for yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe children had watched, spellbound, the interesting tears that became\r\nvisible as they rolled off the invisible nose of the miserable Eliza.\r\nNow Gerald roused himself, and spoke.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use your talking,\" he said. \"We can't see you!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what _he_ said,\" said Eliza's voice, \"but----\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't see yourself,\" Gerald, went on. \"Where's your hand?\"\r\n\r\nEliza, no doubt, tried to see it, and of course failed; for instantly,\r\nwith a shriek that might have brought the police if there had been any\r\nabout, she went into a violent fit of hysterics. The children did what\r\nthey could, everything that they had read of in books as suitable to\r\nsuch occasions, but it is extremely difficult to do the right thing with\r\nan invisible housemaid in strong hysterics and her best clothes. That\r\nwas why the best hat was found, later on, to be completely ruined, and\r\nwhy the best blue dress was never quite itself again. And as they were\r\nburning bits of the feather dusting-brush as nearly under Eliza's nose\r\nas they could guess, a sudden spurt of flame and a horrible smell, as\r\nthe flame died between the quick hands of Gerald, showed but too plainly\r\nthat Eliza's feather boa had tried to help.\r\n\r\nIt did help. Eliza \"came to\" with a deep sob and said, \"Don't burn me\r\nreal ostrich stole; I'm better now.\"\r\n\r\nThey helped her up and she sat down on the bottom step, and the children\r\nexplained to her very carefully and quite kindly that she really was\r\ninvisible, and that if you steal--or even borrow--rings you can never be\r\nsure what will happen to you.\r\n\r\n\"But 'ave I got to go on stopping like this,\" she moaned, when they had\r\nfetched the little mahogany looking-glass from its nail over the kitchen\r\nsink, and convinced her that she was really invisible, \"for ever and\r\never? An' we was to a bin married come Easter. No one won't marry a gell\r\nas 'e can't see. It aint likely.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not for ever and ever,\" said Mabel kindly, \"but you've got to go\r\nthrough with it--like measles. I expect you'll be all right to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-night, _I_ think,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"We'll help you all we can, and not tell any one,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Not even the police,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Now let's get Mademoiselle's tea ready,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"And ours,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Gerald, \"we'll have our tea _out_. We'll have a picnic and\r\nwe'll take Eliza. I'll go out and get the cakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ shan't eat no cake, Master Jerry,\" said Eliza's voice, \"so don't\r\nyou think it. You'd see it going down inside my chest. It wouldn't be\r\nwhat I should call nice of me to have cake showing through me in the\r\nopen air. Oh, it's a dreadful judgment--just for a borrow!\"\r\n\r\nThey reassured her, set the tea, deputed Kathleen to let in\r\nMademoiselle--who came home tired and a little sad, it seemed--waited\r\nfor her and Gerald and the cakes, and started off for Yalding Towers.\r\n\r\n\"Picnic parties aren't allowed,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"Ours will be,\" said Gerald briefly. \"Now, Eliza, you catch on to\r\nKathleen's arm and I'll walk behind to conceal your shadow. My aunt!\r\ntake your hat off. It makes your shadow look like I don't know what.\r\nPeople will think we're the county lunatic asylum turned loose.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then that the hat, becoming visible in Kathleen's hand, showed\r\nhow little of the sprinkled water had gone where it was meant to go--on\r\nEliza's face.\r\n\r\n\"Me best 'at,\" said Eliza, and there was a silence with sniffs in it.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Mabel, \"you cheer up. Just you think this is all a\r\ndream. It's just the kind of thing you might dream if your conscience\r\nhad got pains in it about the ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"But will I wake up again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, you'll wake up again. Now we're going to bandage your eyes and\r\ntake you through a very small door, and don't you resist, or we'll bring\r\na policeman into the dream like a shot.\"\r\n\r\nI have not time to describe Eliza's entrance into the cave. She went\r\nhead first: the girls propelled and the boys received her. If Gerald had\r\nnot thought of tying her hands some one would certainly have been\r\nscratched. As it was Mabel's hand was scraped between the cold rock and\r\na passionate boot-heel. Nor will I tell you all that she said as they\r\nled her along the fern-bordered gully and through the arch into the\r\nwonderland of Italian scenery. She had but little language left when\r\nthey removed her bandage under a weeping willow where a statue of Diana,\r\nbow in hand, stood poised on one toe, a most unsuitable attitude for\r\narchery, I have always thought.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Gerald, \"it's all over--nothing but niceness now and cake\r\nand things.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's time we did have our tea,\" said Jimmy. And it was.\r\n\r\nEliza, once convinced that her chest, though invisible, was not\r\ntransparent, and that her companions could not by looking through it\r\ncount how many buns she had eaten, made an excellent meal. So did the\r\nothers. If you want really to enjoy your tea, have minced veal and\r\npotatoes and rice-pudding for dinner, with several hours of excitement\r\nto follow, and take your tea late.\r\n\r\nThe soft, cool green and grey of the garden were changing--the green\r\ngrew golden, the shadows black, and the lake where the swans were\r\nmirrored upside down, under the Temple of Phoebus, was bathed in rosy\r\nlight from the little fluffy clouds that lay opposite the sunset.\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ pretty,\" said Eliza, \"just like a picture-postcard, aint\r\nit?--the tuppenny kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ought to be getting home,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"I can't go home like this. I'd stay and be a savage and live in that\r\nwhite hut if it had any walls and doors,\" said Eliza.\r\n\r\n\"She means the Temple of Dionysus,\" said Mabel, pointing to it.\r\n\r\nThe sun set suddenly behind the line of black fir-trees on the top of\r\nthe slope, and the white temple, that had been pink, turned grey.\r\n\r\n\"It would be a very nice place to live in even as it is,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Draughty,\" said Eliza, \"and law, what a lot of steps to clean! What\r\nthey make houses for without no walls to 'em? Who'd live in----\" She\r\nbroke off, stared, and added: \"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"That white thing coming down the steps. Why, it's a young man in\r\nstatooary.\"\r\n\r\n\"The statues do come alive here, after sunset,\" said Gerald in very\r\nmatter-of-fact tones.\r\n\r\n\"I see they do.\" Eliza did not seem at all surprised or alarmed.\r\n\"There's another of 'em. Look at them little wings to his feet like\r\npigeons.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect that's Mercury,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"It's 'Hermes' under the statue that's got wings on its feet,\" said\r\nMabel, \"but----\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ don't see any statues,\" said Jimmy. \"What are you punching me for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see?\" Gerald whispered; but he need not have been so\r\ntroubled, for all Eliza's attention was with her wandering eyes that\r\nfollowed hither and thither the quick movements of unseen statues.\r\n\"Don't you see? The statues come alive when the sun goes down--and you\r\ncan't see them unless you're invisible--and _I_--if you _do_ see them\r\nyou're not frightened--unless you _touch_ them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's get her to touch one and see,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"'E's lep' into the water,\" said Eliza in a rapt voice. \"My, can't he\r\nswim neither! And the one with the pigeons' wings is flying all over the\r\nlake having larks with 'im. I do call that pretty. It's like cupids as\r\nyou see on wedding-cakes. And here's another of 'em, a little chap with\r\nlong ears and a baby deer galloping alongside! An' look at the lady with\r\nthe biby, throwing it up and catching it like as if it was a ball. I\r\nwonder she ain't afraid. But it's pretty to see 'em.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'E'S LEP' INTO THE WATER,\" SAID ELIZA IN A RAPT VOICE.\r\n\"MY, CAN'T HE SWIM NEITHER!\"]\r\n\r\nThe broad park lay stretched before the children in growing greyness and\r\na stillness that deepened. Amid the thickening shadows they could see\r\nthe statues gleam white and motionless. But Eliza saw other things. She\r\nwatched in silence presently, and they watched silently, and the evening\r\nfell like a veil that grew heavier and blacker. And it was night. And\r\nthe moon came up above the trees.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" cried Eliza suddenly, \"here's the dear little boy with the\r\ndeer--he's coming right for me, bless his heart!\"\r\n\r\nNext moment she was screaming, and her screams grew fainter and there\r\nwas the sound of swift boots on gravel.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" cried Gerald; \"she touched it, and then she was frightened.\r\nJust like I was. Run! she'll send every one in the town mad if she gets\r\nthere like that. Just a voice and boots! Run! Run!\"\r\n\r\nThey ran. But Eliza had the start of them. Also when she ran on the\r\ngrass they could not hear her footsteps and had to wait for the sound of\r\nleather on far-away gravel. Also she was driven by fear, and fear drives\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nShe went, it seemed, the nearest way, invisibly through the waxing\r\nmoonlight, seeing she only knew what amid the glades and groves.\r\n\r\n\"I'll stop here; see you to-morrow,\" gasped Mabel, as the loud pursuers\r\nfollowed Eliza's clatter across the terrace. \"She's gone through the\r\nstable yard.\"\r\n\r\n\"The back way,\" Gerald panted as they turned the corner of their own\r\nstreet, and he and Jimmy swung in past the water-butt.\r\n\r\nAn unseen but agitated presence seemed to be fumbling with the locked\r\nback-door. The church clock struck the half-hour.\r\n\r\n\"Half-past nine,\" Gerald had just breath to say. \"Pull at the ring.\r\nPerhaps it'll come off now.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke to the bare doorstep. But it was Eliza, dishevelled,\r\nbreathless, her hair coming down, her collar crooked, her dress twisted\r\nand disordered, who suddenly held out a hand--a hand that they could\r\nsee; and in the hand, plainly visible in the moonlight, the dark circle\r\nof the magic ring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"'Alf a mo!\" said Eliza's gentleman friend next morning. He was waiting\r\nfor her when she opened the door with pail and hearthstone in her hand.\r\n\"Sorry you couldn't come out yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"So'm I.\" Eliza swept the wet flannel along the top step. \"What did you\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IT WAS ELIZA, DISHEVELLED, BREATHLESS, HER HAIR COMING\r\nDOWN, HER COLLAR CROOKED, HER DRESS TWISTED AND DISORDERED, WHO SUDDENLY\r\nHELD OUT A HAND.]\r\n\r\n\"I 'ad a bit of a headache,\" said the gentleman friend. \"I laid down\r\nmost of the afternoon. What were you up to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing pertickler,\" said Eliza.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Then it was all a dream,\" she said, when he was gone; \"but it'll be a\r\nlesson to me not to meddle with anybody's old ring again in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"So they didn't tell 'er about me behaving like I did,\" said he as he\r\nwent--\"sun, I suppose--like our Army in India. I hope I aint going to be\r\nliable to it, that's all!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHNSON was the hero of the hour. It was he who had tracked the\r\nburglars, laid his plans, and recovered the lost silver. He had not\r\nthrown the stone--public opinion decided that Mabel and her aunt must\r\nhave been mistaken in supposing that there was a stone at all. But he\r\ndid not deny the warning letter. It was Gerald who went out after\r\nbreakfast to buy the newspaper, and who read aloud to the others the two\r\ncolumns of fiction which were the _Liddlesby Observer's_ report of the\r\nfacts. As he read every mouth opened wider and wider, and when he ceased\r\nwith \"this gifted fellow-townsman with detective instincts which\r\noutrival those of Messrs. Lecoq and Holmes, and whose promotion is now\r\nassured,\" there was quite a blank silence.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Jimmy, breaking it, \"he doesn't stick it on neither, does\r\nhe?\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel,\" said Kathleen, \"as if it was our fault--as if it was us had\r\ntold all these whoppers; because if it hadn't been for you they couldn't\r\nhave, Jerry. How could he say all that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Gerald, trying to be fair, \"you know, after all, the chap\r\nhad to say something. I'm glad I----\" He stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"You're glad you what?\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter,\" said he, with an air of putting away affairs of state.\r\n\"Now, what are we going to do to-day? The faithful Mabel approaches; she\r\nwill want her ring. And you and Jimmy want it too. Oh, I know.\r\nMademoiselle hasn't had any attention paid to her for more days than our\r\nhero likes to confess.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you wouldn't always call yourself 'our hero,'\" said Jimmy; \"you\r\naren't mine, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're both of you _mine_,\" said Kathleen hastily.\r\n\r\n\"Good little girl.\" Gerald smiled annoyingly. \"Keep baby brother in a\r\ngood temper till Nursie comes back.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not going out without us?\" Kathleen asked in haste.\r\n\r\n          \"'I haste away,\r\n            'Tis market day,'\"\r\n\r\nsang Gerald,\r\n\r\n          \"'And in the market there\r\n            Buy roses for my fair.'\r\n\r\nIf you want to come too, get your boots on, and look slippy about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to come,\" said Jimmy, and sniffed.\r\n\r\nKathleen turned a despairing look on Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, James, James,\" said Gerald sadly, \"how difficult you make it for\r\nme to forget that you're my little brother! If ever I treat you like one\r\nof the other chaps, and rot you like I should Turner or Moberley or any\r\nof my pals--well, this is what comes of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't call them your baby brothers,\" said Jimmy, and truly.\r\n\r\n\"No; and I'll take precious good care I don't call you it again. Come\r\non, my hero and heroine. The devoted Mesrour is your salaaming slave.\"\r\n\r\nThe three met Mabel opportunely at the corner of the square where every\r\nFriday the stalls and the awnings and the green umbrellas were pitched,\r\nand poultry, pork, pottery, vegetables, drapery, sweets, toys, tools,\r\nmirrors, and all sorts of other interesting merchandise were spread out\r\non trestle tables, piled on carts whose horses were stabled and whose\r\nshafts were held in place by piled wooden cases, or laid out, as in the\r\ncase of crockery and hardware, on the bare flagstones of the\r\nmarket-place.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining with great goodwill, and, as Mabel remarked, \"all\r\nNature looked smiling and gay.\" There were a few bunches of flowers\r\namong the vegetables, and the children hesitated, balanced in choice.\r\n\r\n\"Mignonette is sweet,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"Roses are roses,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Carnations are tuppence,\" said Jimmy; and Gerald, sniffing among the\r\nbunches of tightly-tied tea-roses, agreed that this settled it.\r\n\r\nSo the carnations were bought, a bunch of yellow ones, like sulphur, a\r\nbunch of white ones like clotted cream, and a bunch of red ones like the\r\ncheeks of the doll that Kathleen never played with. They took the\r\ncarnations home, and Kathleen's green hair-ribbon came in beautifully\r\nfor tying them up, which was hastily done on the doorstep.\r\n\r\nThen discreetly Gerald knocked at the door of the drawing-room, where\r\nMademoiselle seemed to sit all day.\r\n\r\n\"Entrez!\" came her voice; and Gerald entered. She was not reading, as\r\nusual, but bent over a sketch-book; on the table was an open colour-box\r\nof un-English appearance, and a box of that slate-coloured liquid so\r\nfamiliar alike to the greatest artist in water-colours and to the\r\nhumblest child with a six-penny paint-box.\r\n\r\n\"With all of our loves,\" said Gerald, laying the flowers down suddenly\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\n\"But it is that you are a dear child. For this it must that I embrace\r\nyou--no?\" And before Gerald could explain that he was too old, she\r\nkissed him with little quick French pecks on the two cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Are you painting?\" he asked hurriedly, to hide his annoyance at being\r\ntreated like a baby.\r\n\r\n\"I achieve a sketch of yesterday,\" she answered; and before he had time\r\nto wonder what yesterday would look like in a picture she showed him a\r\nbeautiful and exact sketch of Yalding Towers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHE KISSED HIM WITH LITTLE QUICK FRENCH PECKS.]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I say--ripping!\" was the critic's comment. \"I say, mayn't the\r\nothers come and see?\" The others came, including Mabel, who stood\r\nawkwardly behind the rest, and looked over Jimmy's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I say, you are clever,\" said Gerald respectfully.\r\n\r\n\"To what good to have the talent, when one must pass one's life at\r\nteaching the infants?\" said Mademoiselle.\r\n\r\n\"It must be fairly beastly,\" Gerald owned.\r\n\r\n\"You, too, see the design?\" Mademoiselle asked Mabel, adding: \"A friend\r\nfrom the town, yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you do?\" said Mabel politely. \"No, I'm not from the town. I live\r\nat Yalding Towers.\"\r\n\r\nThe name seemed to impress Mademoiselle very much. Gerald anxiously\r\nhoped in his own mind that she was not a snob.\r\n\r\n\"Yalding Towers,\" she repeated, \"but this is very extraordinary. Is it\r\npossible that you are then of the family of Lord Yalding?\"\r\n\r\n\"He hasn't any family,\" said Mabel; \"he's not married.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would say are you--how you say?--cousin--sister--niece?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mabel, flushing hotly, \"I'm nothing grand at all. I'm Lord\r\nYalding's housekeeper's niece.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know Lord Yalding, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mabel, \"I've never seen him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He comes then never to his chateau?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not since I've lived there. But he's coming next week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why lives he not there?\" Mademoiselle asked.\r\n\r\n\"Auntie say he's too poor,\" said Mabel, and proceeded to tell the tale\r\nas she had heard it in the housekeeper's room: how Lord Yalding's uncle\r\nhad left all the money he could leave away from Lord Yalding to Lord\r\nYalding's second cousin, and poor Lord Yalding had only just enough to\r\nkeep the old place in repair, and to live very quietly indeed somewhere\r\nelse, but not enough to keep the house open or to live there; and how he\r\ncouldn't sell the house because it was \"in tale.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it then--in tail?\" asked Mademoiselle.\r\n\r\n\"In a tale that the lawyers write out,\" said Mabel, proud of her\r\nknowledge and flattered by the deep interest of the French governess;\r\n\"and when once they've put your house in one of their tales you can't\r\nsell it or give it away, but you have to leave it to your son, even if\r\nyou don't want to.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how his uncle could he be so cruel--to leave him the chateau and no\r\nmoney?\" Mademoiselle asked; and Kathleen and Jimmy stood amazed at the\r\nsudden keenness of her interest in what seemed to them the dullest\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can tell you that too,\" said Mabel. \"Lord Yalding wanted to marry\r\na lady his uncle didn't want him to, a barmaid or a ballet lady or\r\nsomething, and he wouldn't give her up, and his uncle said, 'Well\r\nthen,' and left everything to the cousin.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you say he is not married.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--the lady went into a convent; I expect she's bricked-up alive by\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bricked----?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a wall, you know,\" said Mabel, pointing explainingly at the pink and\r\ngilt roses of the wall-paper, \"shut up to kill them. That's what they do\r\nto you in convents.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Mademoiselle; \"in convents are very kind good women;\r\nthere is but one thing in convents that is detestable--the locks on the\r\ndoors. Sometimes people cannot get out, especially when they are very\r\nyoung and their relations have placed them there for their welfare and\r\nhappiness. But brick--how you say it?--enwalling ladies to kill them.\r\nNo--it does itself never. And this Lord--he did not then seek his lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes--he sought her right enough,\" Mabel assured her; \"but there are\r\nmillions of convents, you know, and he had no idea where to look, and\r\nthey sent back his letters from the post-office, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ciel!\" cried Mademoiselle, \"but it seems that one knows all in the\r\nhousekeeper's saloon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty well all,\" said Mabel simply.\r\n\r\n\"And you think he will find her? No?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he'll find her all right,\" said Mabel, \"when he's old and broken\r\ndown, you know--and dying; and then a gentle sister of charity will\r\nsoothe his pillow, and just when he's dying she'll reveal herself and\r\nsay: 'My own lost love!' and his face will light up with a wonderful joy\r\nand he'll expire with her beloved name on his parched lips.\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle's was the silence of sheer astonishment. \"You do the\r\nprophesy, it appears?\" she said at last.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" said Mabel, \"I got that out of a book. I can tell you lots more\r\nfatal love stories any time you like.\"\r\n\r\nThe French governess gave a little jump, as though she had suddenly\r\nremembered something.\r\n\r\n\"It is nearly dinner-time,\" she said. \"Your friend--Mabelle, yes--will\r\nbe your convivial, and in her honour we will make a little feast. My\r\nbeautiful flowers--put them to the water, Kathleen. I run to buy the\r\ncakes. Wash the hands, all, and be ready when I return.\"\r\n\r\nSmiling and nodding to the children, she left them, and ran up the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\"Just as if she was young,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"She _is_ young,\" said Mabel. \"Heaps of ladies have offers of marriage\r\nwhen they're no younger than her. I've seen lots of weddings too, with\r\nmuch older brides. And why didn't you tell me she was so beautiful?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Is_ she?\" asked Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Of course she is; and what a darling to think of cakes for me, and\r\ncalling me a convivial!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Gerald, \"I call this jolly decent of her. You know,\r\ngovernesses never have more than the meanest pittance, just enough to\r\nsustain life, and here she is spending her little all on us. Supposing\r\nwe just don't go out to-day, but play with her instead. I expect she's\r\nmost awfully bored really.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would she really like it?\" Kathleen wondered. \"Aunt Emily says\r\ngrown-ups never really like playing. They do it to please us.\"\r\n\r\n\"They little know,\" Gerald answered, \"how often we do it to please\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got to do that dressing-up with the Princess clothes anyhow--we\r\nsaid we would,\" said Kathleen. \"Let's treat her to that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather near tea-time,\" urged Jimmy, \"so that there'll be a fortunate\r\ninterruption and the play won't go on for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose all the things are safe?\" Mabel asked.\r\n\r\n\"Quite. I told you where I put them. Come on, Jimmy; let's help lay the\r\ntable. We'll get Eliza to put out the best china.\"\r\n\r\nThey went.\r\n\r\n\"It was lucky,\" said Gerald, struck by a sudden thought, \"that the\r\nburglars didn't go for the diamonds in the treasure-chamber.\"\r\n\r\n\"They couldn't,\" said Mabel almost in a whisper; \"they didn't know about\r\nthem. I don't believe anybody knows about them, except me--and you, and\r\nyou're sworn to secrecy.\" This, you will remember, had been done almost\r\nat the beginning. \"I know aunt doesn't know. I just found out the\r\nspring by accident. Lord Yalding's kept the secret well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I'd got a secret like that to keep,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"If the burglars _do_ know,\" said Mabel, \"it'll all come out at the\r\ntrial. Lawyers make you tell everything you know at trials, and a lot of\r\nlies besides.\"\r\n\r\n\"There won't be any trial,\" said Gerald, kicking the leg of the piano\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"No trial?\"\r\n\r\n\"It said in the paper.\" Gerald went on slowly, \"'The miscreants must\r\nhave received warning from a confederate, for the admirable preparations\r\nto arrest them as they returned for their ill-gotten plunder were\r\nunavailing. But the police have a clue.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What a pity!\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't worry--they haven't got any old clue,\" said Gerald, still\r\nattentive to the piano leg.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean the clue; I meant the confederate.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a pity you think he's a pity, because he was _me_,\" said Gerald,\r\nstanding up and leaving the piano leg alone. He looked straight before\r\nhim, as the boy on the burning deck may have looked.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't help it,\" he said. \"I know you'll think I'm a criminal, but\r\nI couldn't do it. I don't know how detectives can. I went over a prison\r\nonce, with father; and after I'd given the tip to Johnson I remembered\r\nthat, and I just couldn't. I know I'm a beast, and not worthy to be a\r\nBritish citizen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it was rather nice of you,\" said Mabel kindly. \"How did you\r\nwarn them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I just shoved a paper under the man's door--the one that I knew where\r\nhe lived--to tell him to lie low.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! do tell me--what did you put on it exactly?\" Mabel warmed to this\r\nnew interest.\r\n\r\n\"It said: 'The police know all except your names. Be virtuous and you\r\nare safe. But if there's any more burgling I shall split and you may\r\nrely on that from a friend.' I know it was wrong, but I couldn't help\r\nit. Don't tell the others. They wouldn't understand why I did it. I\r\ndon't understand it myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Mabel: \"it's because you've got a kind and noble heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kind fiddlestick, my good child!\" said Gerald, suddenly losing the\r\nburning boy expression and becoming in a flash entirely himself. \"Cut\r\nalong and wash your hands; you're as black as ink.\"\r\n\r\n\"So are you,\" said Mabel, \"and I'm not. It's dye with me. Auntie was\r\ndyeing a blouse this morning. It told you how in _Home Drivel_--and\r\nshe's as black as ink too, and the blouse is all streaky. Pity the ring\r\nwon't make just parts of you invisible--the dirt, for instance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Gerald said unexpectedly, \"it won't make even all of you\r\ninvisible again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? You haven't been doing anything to it--have you?\" Mabel\r\nsharply asked.\r\n\r\n\"No; but didn't you notice you were invisible twenty-one hours; I was\r\nfourteen hours invisible, and Eliza only seven--that's seven less each\r\ntime. And now we've come to----\"\r\n\r\n\"How frightfully good you are at sums!\" said Mabel, awestruck.\r\n\r\n\"You see, it's got seven hours less each time, and seven from seven is\r\nnought; it's got to be something different this time. And then\r\nafterwards--it can't be minus seven, because I don't see how--unless it\r\nmade you more visible--thicker, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Don't!_\" said Mabel; \"you make my head go round.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there's another odd thing,\" Gerald went on; \"when you're invisible\r\nyour relations don't love you. Look at your aunt, and Cathy never\r\nturning a hair at me going burgling. We haven't got to the bottom of\r\nthat ring yet. Crikey! here's Mademoiselle with the cakes. Run, bold\r\nbandits--wash for your lives!\"\r\n\r\nThey ran.\r\n\r\nIt was not cakes only; it was plums and grapes and jam tarts and\r\nsoda-water and raspberry vinegar, and chocolates in pretty boxes and\r\n\"pure, thick, rich\" cream in brown jugs, also a big bunch of roses.\r\nMademoiselle was strangely merry, for a governess. She served out the\r\ncakes and tarts with a liberal hand, made wreaths of the flowers for all\r\ntheir heads--she was not eating much herself--drank the health of Mabel,\r\nas the guest of the day, in the beautiful pink drink that comes from\r\nmixing raspberry vinegar and soda-water, and actually persuaded Jimmy\r\nto wear his wreath, on the ground that the Greek gods as well as the\r\ngoddesses always wore wreaths at a feast.\r\n\r\nThere never was such a feast provided by any French governess since\r\nFrench governesses began. There were jokes and stories and laughter.\r\nJimmy showed all those tricks with forks and corks and matches and\r\napples which are so deservedly popular. Mademoiselle told them stories\r\nof her own school-days when she was \"a quite little girl with two tight\r\ntresses--so,\" and when they could not understand the tresses, called for\r\npaper and pencil and drew the loveliest little picture of herself when\r\nshe was a child with two short fat pig-tails sticking out from her head\r\nlike knitting-needles from a ball of dark worsted. Then she drew\r\npictures of everything they asked for, till Mabel pulled Gerald's jacket\r\nand whispered: \"The acting!\"\r\n\r\n\"Draw us the front of a theatre,\" said Gerald tactfully, \"a French\r\ntheatre.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are the same thing as the English theatres,\" Mademoiselle told\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Do you like acting--the theatre, I mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"But yes--I love it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Gerald briefly. \"We'll act a play for you--now--this\r\nafternoon if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eliza will be washing up,\" Cathy whispered, \"and she was promised to\r\nsee it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or this evening,\" said Gerald; \"and please, Mademoiselle, may Eliza\r\ncome in and look on?\"\r\n\r\n\"But certainly,\" said Mademoiselle; \"amuse yourselves well, my\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's _you_,\" said Mabel suddenly, \"that we want to amuse. Because\r\nwe love you very much--don't we, all of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" the chorus came unhesitatingly. Though the others would never\r\nhave thought of saying such a thing on their own account. Yet, as Mabel\r\nsaid it, they found to their surprise that it was true.\r\n\r\n\"Tiens!\" said Mademoiselle, \"you love the old French governess?\r\nImpossible,\" and she spoke rather indistinctly.\r\n\r\n\"You're not old,\" said Mabel; \"at least not so very,\" she added\r\nbrightly, \"and you're as lovely as a Princess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go then, flatteress!\" said Mademoiselle, laughing; and Mabel went. The\r\nothers were already half-way up the stairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOWN CAME THE LOVELIEST BLUE-BLACK HAIR.]\r\n\r\nMademoiselle sat in the drawing-room as usual, and it was a good thing\r\nthat she was not engaged in serious study, for it seemed that the door\r\nopened and shut almost ceaselessly all throughout the afternoon. Might\r\nthey have the embroidered antimacassars and the sofa cushions? Might\r\nthey have the clothes-line out of the washhouse? Eliza said they\r\nmightn't, but might they? Might they have the sheepskin hearth-rugs?\r\nMight they have tea in the garden, because they had almost got the stage\r\nready in the dining-room, and Eliza wanted to set tea? Could\r\nMademoiselle lend them any coloured clothes--scarves or dressing-gowns,\r\nor anything bright? Yes, Mademoiselle could, and did--silk things,\r\nsurprisingly lovely for a governess to have. Had Mademoiselle any rouge?\r\nThey had always heard that French ladies---- No. Mademoiselle\r\nhadn't--and to judge by the colour of her face, Mademoiselle didn't need\r\nit. Did Mademoiselle think the chemist sold rouge--or had she any false\r\nhair to spare? At this challenge Mademoiselle's pale fingers pulled out\r\na dozen hairpins, and down came the loveliest blue-black hair, hanging\r\nto her knees in straight, heavy lines.\r\n\r\n\"No, you terrible infants,\" she cried. \"I have not the false hair, nor\r\nthe rouge. And my teeth--you want them also, without doubt?\"\r\n\r\nShe showed them in a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I _said_ you were a Princess,\" said Mabel, \"and now I know. You're\r\nRupunzel. Do always wear your hair like that! May we have the peacock\r\nfans, please, off the mantelpiece, and the things that loop back the\r\ncurtains, and all the handkerchiefs you've got?\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle denied them nothing. They had the fans and the\r\nhandkerchiefs and some large sheets of expensive drawing-paper out of\r\nthe school cupboard, and Mademoiselle's best sable paint-brush and her\r\npaint-box.\r\n\r\n\"Who would have thought,\" murmured Gerald, pensively sucking the brush\r\nand gazing at the paper mask he had just painted, \"that she was such a\r\nbrick in disguise? I wonder why crimson lake always tastes just like\r\nLiebig's Extract.\"\r\n\r\nEverything was pleasant that day somehow. There are some days like that,\r\nyou know, when everything goes well from the very beginning; all the\r\nthings you want are in their places, nobody misunderstands you, and all\r\nthat you do turns out admirably. How different from those other days\r\nwhich we all know too well, when your shoe-lace breaks, your comb is\r\nmislaid, your brush spins on its back on the floor and lands under the\r\nbed where you can't get at it--you drop the soap, your buttons come off,\r\nan eyelash gets into your eye, you have used your last clean\r\nhandkerchief, your collar is frayed at the edge and cuts your neck, and\r\nat the very last moment your suspender breaks, and there is no string.\r\nOn such a day as this you are naturally late for breakfast, and every\r\none thinks you did it on purpose. And the day goes on and on, getting\r\nworse and worse--you mislay your exercise-book, you drop your arithmetic\r\nin the mud, your pencil breaks, and when you open your knife to sharpen\r\nthe pencil you split your nail. On such a day you jam your thumb in\r\ndoors, and muddle the messages you are sent on by grown-ups. You upset\r\nyour tea, and your bread-and-butter won't hold together for a moment.\r\nAnd when at last you get to bed--usually in disgrace--it is no comfort\r\nat all to you to know that not a single bit of it is your own fault.\r\n\r\nThis day was not one of those days, as you will have noticed. Even the\r\ntea in the garden--there was a bricked bit by a rockery that made a\r\nsteady floor for the tea-table--was most delightful, though the thoughts\r\nof four out of the five were busy with the coming play, and the fifth\r\nhad thoughts of her own that had had nothing to do with tea or acting.\r\n\r\nThen there was an interval of slamming doors, interesting silences, feet\r\nthat flew up and down stairs.\r\n\r\nIt was still good daylight when the dinner-bell rang--the signal had\r\nbeen agreed upon at tea-time, and carefully explained to Eliza.\r\nMademoiselle laid down her book and passed out of the sunset-yellowed\r\nhall into the faint yellow gaslight of the dining-room. The giggling\r\nEliza held the door open before her, and followed her in. The shutters\r\nhad been closed--streaks of daylight showed above and below them. The\r\ngreen-and-black tablecloths of the school dining-tables were supported\r\non the clothes-line from the backyard. The line sagged in a graceful\r\ncurve, but it answered its purpose of supporting the curtains which\r\nconcealed that part of the room which was the stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHE SAW THAT FULLY HALF A DOZEN OF THESE CHAIRS WERE\r\nOCCUPIED, AND BY THE QUEEREST PEOPLE.]\r\n\r\nRows of chairs had been placed across the other end of the room--all the\r\nchairs in the house, as it seemed--and Mademoiselle started violently\r\nwhen she saw that fully half a dozen of these chairs were occupied. And\r\nby the queerest people, too--an old woman with a poke bonnet tied under\r\nher chin with a red handkerchief, a lady in a large straw hat wreathed\r\nin flowers and the oddest hands that stuck out over the chair in front\r\nof her, several men with strange, clumsy figures, and all with hats\r\non.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" whispered Mademoiselle, through the chinks of the tablecloths,\r\n\"you have then invited other friends? You should have asked me, my\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\nLaughter and something like a \"hurrah\" answered her from behind the\r\nfolds of the curtaining tablecloths.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Mademoiselle Rapunzel,\" cried Mabel; \"turn the gas up. It's\r\nonly part of the entertainment.\"\r\n\r\nEliza, still giggling, pushed through the lines of chairs, knocking off\r\nthe hat of one of the visitors as she did so, and turned up the three\r\nincandescent burners.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle looked at the figure seated nearest to her, stooped to look\r\nmore closely, half laughed, quite screamed, and sat down suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she cried, \"they are not alive!\"\r\n\r\nEliza, with a much louder scream, had found out the same thing and\r\nannounced it differently. \"They ain't got no insides,\" said she. The\r\nseven members of the audience seated among the wilderness of chairs had,\r\nindeed, no insides to speak of. Their bodies were bolsters and rolled-up\r\nblankets, their spines were broom-handles, and their arm and leg bones\r\nwere hockey sticks and umbrellas. Their shoulders were the wooden\r\ncross-pieces that Mademoiselle used for keeping her jackets in shape;\r\ntheir hands were gloves stuffed out with handkerchiefs; and their faces\r\nwere the paper masks painted in the afternoon by the untutored brush of\r\nGerald, tied on to the round heads made of the ends of stuffed\r\nbolster-cases. The faces were really rather dreadful. Gerald had done\r\nhis best, but even after his best had been done you would hardly have\r\nknown they were faces, some of them, if they hadn't been in the\r\npositions which faces visually occupy, between the collar and the hat.\r\nTheir eyebrows were furious with lamp-black frowns--their eyes the size,\r\nand almost the shape, of five-shilling pieces, and on their lips and\r\ncheeks had been spent much crimson lake and nearly the whole of a\r\nhalf-pan of vermilion.\r\n\r\n\"You have made yourself an auditors, yes? Bravo!\" cried Mademoiselle,\r\nrecovering herself and beginning to clap. And to the sound of that\r\nclapping the curtain went up--or, rather, apart. A voice said, in a\r\nbreathless, choked way, \"Beauty and the Beast,\" and the stage was\r\nrevealed.\r\n\r\nIt was a real stage too--the dining-tables pushed close together and\r\ncovered with pink-and-white counterpanes. It was a little unsteady and\r\ncreaky to walk on, but very imposing to look at. The scene was simple,\r\nbut convincing. A big sheet of cardboard, bent square, with slits cut in\r\nit and a candle behind, represented, quite transparently, the domestic\r\nhearth; a round hat-tin of Eliza's, supported on a stool with a\r\nnight-light under it, could not have been mistaken, save by wilful\r\nmalice, for anything but a copper. A waste-paper basket with two or\r\nthree school dusters and an overcoat in it, and a pair of blue pyjamas\r\nover the back of a chair, put the finishing touch to the scene. It did\r\nnot need the announcement from the wings, \"The laundry at Beauty's\r\nhome.\" It was so plainly a laundry and nothing else.\r\n\r\nIn the wings: \"They look just like a real audience, don't they?\"\r\nwhispered Mabel. \"Go on, Jimmy,--don't forget the Merchant has to be\r\npompous and use long words.\"\r\n\r\nJimmy, enlarged by pillows under Gerald's best overcoat, which had been\r\nintentionally bought with a view to his probable growth during the two\r\nyears which it was intended to last him, a Turkish towel turban on his\r\nhead and an open umbrella over it, opened the first act in a simple and\r\nswift soliloquy:\r\n\r\n\"I am the most unlucky merchant that ever was. I was once the richest\r\nmerchant in Bagdad, but I lost all my ships, and now I live in a poor\r\nhouse that is all to bits; you can see how the rain comes through the\r\nroof, and my daughters take in washing. And----\"\r\n\r\nThe pause might have seemed long, but Gerald rustled in, elegant in\r\nMademoiselle's pink dressing-gown and the character of the eldest\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n\"A nice drying day,\" he minced. \"Pa dear, put the umbrella the other way\r\nup. It'll save us going out in the rain to fetch water. Come on,\r\nsisters, dear father's got us a new wash-tub. Here's luxury!\"\r\n\r\nRound the umbrella, now held the wrong way up, the three sisters knelt\r\nand washed imaginary linen. Kathleen wore a violet skirt of Eliza's, a\r\nblue blouse of her own, and a cap of knotted handkerchiefs. A white\r\nnightdress girt with a white apron and two red carnations in Mabel's\r\nblack hair left no doubt as to which of the three was Beauty.\r\n\r\nThe scene went very well. The final dance with waving towels was all\r\nthat there is of charming, Mademoiselle said; and Eliza was so much\r\namused that, as she said, she got quite a nasty stitch along of laughing\r\nso hearty.\r\n\r\nYou know pretty well what Beauty and the Beast would be like acted by\r\nfour children who had spent the afternoon in arranging their costumes\r\nand so had left no time for rehearsing what they had to say. Yet it\r\ndelighted them, and it charmed their audience. And what more can any\r\nplay do, even Shakespeare's? Mabel, in her Princess clothes, was a\r\nresplendent Beauty; and Gerald a Beast who wore the drawing-room\r\nhearthrugs with an air of indescribable distinction. If Jimmy was not a\r\ntalkative merchant, he made it up with a stoutness practically\r\nunlimited, and Kathleen surprised and delighted even herself by the\r\nquickness with which she changed from one to the other of the minor\r\ncharacters--fairies, servants, and messengers. It was at the end of the\r\nsecond act that Mabel, whose costume, having reached the height of\r\nelegance, could not be bettered and therefore did not need to be\r\nchanged, said to Gerald, sweltering under the weighty magnificence of\r\nhis beast-skin:--\r\n\r\n\"I say, you might let us have the ring back.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to,\" said Gerald, who had quite forgotten it. \"I'll give it\r\nyou in the next scene. Only don't lose it, or go putting it on. You\r\nmight go out all together and never be seen again, or you might get\r\nseven times as visible as any one else, so that all the rest of us would\r\nlook like shadows beside you, you'd be so thick, or----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ready!\" said Kathleen, bustling in, once more a wicked sister.\r\n\r\nGerald managed to get his hand into his pocket under his hearthrug, and\r\nwhen he rolled his eyes in agonies of sentiment, and said, \"Farewell,\r\ndear Beauty! Return quickly, for if you remain long absent from your\r\nfaithful beast he will assuredly perish,\" he pressed a ring into her\r\nhand and added: \"This is a magic ring that will give you anything you\r\nwish. When you desire to return to your own disinterested beast, put on\r\nthe ring and utter your wish. Instantly you will be by my side.\"\r\n\r\nBeauty-Mabel took the ring, and it was _the_ ring.\r\n\r\nThe curtains closed to warm applause from two pairs of hands.\r\n\r\nThe next scene went splendidly. The sisters were almost _too_ natural in\r\ntheir disagreeableness, and Beauty's annoyance when they splashed her\r\nPrincess's dress with real soap and water was considered a miracle of\r\ngood acting. Even the merchant rose to something more than mere pillows,\r\nand the curtain fell on his pathetic assurance that in the absence of\r\nhis dear Beauty he was wasting away to a shadow. And again two pairs of\r\nhands applauded.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Mabel, catch hold,\" Gerald appealed from under the weight of a\r\ntowel-horse, the tea-urn, the tea-tray, and the green baize apron of the\r\nboot boy, which together with four red geraniums from the landing, the\r\npampas-grass from the drawing-room fireplace, and the indiarubber plants\r\nfrom the drawing-room window were to represent the fountains and garden\r\nof the last act. The applause had died away.\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" said Mabel, taking on herself the weight of the tea-urn, \"I\r\nwish those creatures we made were alive. We should get something like\r\napplause then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm jolly glad they aren't,\" said Gerald, arranging the baize and the\r\ntowel-horse. \"Brutes! It makes me feel quite silly when I catch their\r\npaper eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe curtains were drawn back. There lay the hearth-rug-coated beast, in\r\nflat abandonment among the tropic beauties of the garden, the\r\npampas-grass shrubbery, the indiarubber plant bushes, the geranium-trees\r\nand the urn fountain. Beauty was ready to make her great entry in all\r\nthe thrilling splendour of despair. And then suddenly it all happened.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle began it: she applauded the garden scene--with hurried\r\nlittle clappings of her quick French hands. Eliza's fat red palms\r\nfollowed heavily, and then--some one else was clapping, six or seven\r\npeople, and their clapping made a dull padded sound. Nine faces instead\r\nof two were turned towards the stage, and seven out of the nine were\r\npainted, pointed paper faces. And every hand and every face was alive.\r\nThe applause grew louder as Mabel glided forward, and as she paused and\r\nlooked at the audience her unstudied pose of horror and amazement drew\r\nforth applause louder still; but it was not loud enough to drown the\r\nshrieks of Mademoiselle and Eliza as they rushed from the room, knocking\r\nchairs over and crushing each other in the doorway. Two distant doors\r\nbanged, Mademoiselle's door and Eliza's door.\r\n\r\n\"Curtain! curtain! quick!\" cried Beauty-Mabel, in a voice that wasn't\r\nMabel's or the Beauty's. \"Jerry--those things _have_ come alive. Oh,\r\nwhatever _shall_ we do?\"\r\n\r\nGerald in his hearthrugs leaped to his feet. Again that flat padded\r\napplause marked the swish of cloths on clothes-line as Jimmy and\r\nKathleen drew the curtains.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" they asked as they drew.\r\n\r\n\"You've done it this time!\" said Gerald to the pink, perspiring Mabel.\r\n\"Oh, bother these strings!\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you burst them? _I've_ done it?\" retorted Mabel. \"I like that!\"\r\n\r\n\"More than I do,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's all right,\" said Mabel, \"Come on. We must go and pull the\r\nthings to pieces--then they _can't_ go on being alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's your fault, anyhow,\" said Gerald with every possible absence of\r\ngallantry. \"Don't you see? It's turned into a wishing ring. I _knew_\r\nsomething different was going to happen. Get my knife out of my\r\npocket--this string's in a knot. Jimmy, Cathy, those Ugly-Wuglies have\r\ncome alive--because Mabel wished it. Cut out and pull them to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nJimmy and Cathy peeped through the curtain and recoiled with white faces\r\nand staring eyes. \"Not me!\" was the brief rejoinder of Jimmy. Cathy\r\nsaid, \"Not much!\" And she meant it, any one could see that.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as Gerald, almost free of the hearth-rugs, broke his thumb-nail\r\non the stiffest blade of his knife, a thick rustling and a sharp, heavy\r\nstumping sounded beyond the curtain.\r\n\r\n\"They're going out!\" screamed Kathleen--\"_walking_ out--on their\r\numbrella and broomstick legs. You can't stop them, Jerry, they're too\r\nawful!\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody in the town'll be insane by to-morrow night if we _don't_\r\nstop them,\" cried Gerald. \"Here, give me the ring--I'll unwish them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LIMP HAND WAS LAID ON HIS ARM.]\r\n\r\nHe caught the ring from the unresisting Mabel, cried, \"I wish the Uglies\r\n_weren't_ alive,\" and tore through the door. He saw, in fancy, Mabel's\r\nwish undone, and the empty hall strewed with limp bolsters, hats,\r\numbrellas, coats and gloves, prone abject properties from which the\r\nbrief life had gone out for ever. But the hall was crowded with live\r\nthings, strange things--all horribly short as broomsticks and umbrellas\r\nare short. A limp hand gesticulated. A pointed white face with red\r\ncheeks looked up at him, and wide red lips said something, he could not\r\ntell what. The voice reminded him of the old beggar down by the bridge\r\nwho had no roof to his mouth. These creatures had no roofs to their\r\nmouths, of course--they had no----\r\n\r\n\"Aa oo re o me me oo a oo ho el?\" said the voice again. And it had said\r\nit four times before Gerald could collect himself sufficiently to\r\nunderstand that this horror--alive, and most likely quite\r\nuncontrollable--was saying, with a dreadful calm, polite persistence:--\r\n\r\n\"Can you recommend me to a good hotel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CAN you recommend me to a good hotel?\" The speaker had no inside to his\r\nhead. Gerald had the best of reasons for knowing it. The speaker's coat\r\nhad no shoulders inside it--only the cross-bar that a jacket is slung on\r\nby careful ladies. The hand raised in interrogation was not a hand at\r\nall; it was a glove lumpily stuffed with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the\r\narm attached to it was only Kathleen's school umbrella. Yet the whole\r\nthing was alive, and was asking a definite, and for anybody else,\r\nanybody who really _was_ a body, a reasonable question.\r\n\r\nWith a sensation of inward sinking, Gerald realised that now or never\r\nwas the time for him to rise to the occasion. And at the thought he\r\ninwardly sank more deeply than before. It seemed impossible to rise in\r\nthe very smallest degree.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon\" was absolutely the best he could do; and the\r\npainted, pointed paper face turned to him once more, and once more\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Aa oo re o me me oo a oo ho el?\"\r\n\r\n\"You want a hotel?\" Gerald repeated stupidly, \"a _good_ hotel?\"\r\n\r\n\"A oo ho el,\" reiterated the painted lips.\r\n\r\n\"I'm awfully sorry,\" Gerald went on--one can always be polite, of\r\ncourse, whatever happens, and politeness came natural to him--\"but all\r\nour hotels shut so early--about eight, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Och em er,\" said the Ugly-Wugly. Gerald even now does not understand\r\nhow that practical joke--hastily wrought of hat, overcoat, paper face\r\nand limp hands--could have managed, by just being alive, to become\r\nperfectly respectable, apparently about fifty years old, and obviously\r\nwell off, known and respected in his own suburb--the kind of man who\r\ntravels first class and smokes expensive cigars. Gerald knew this time,\r\nwithout need of repetition, that the Ugly-Wugly had said:--\r\n\r\n\"Knock 'em up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't,\" Gerald explained; \"they're all stone deaf--every single\r\nperson who keeps a hotel in this town. It's--\" he wildly plunged--\"it's\r\na County Council law. Only deaf people allowed to keep hotels. It's\r\nbecause of the hops in the beer,\" he found himself adding; \"you know,\r\nhops are so good for earache.\"\r\n\r\n\"I o wy ollo oo,\" said the respectable Ugly-Wugly; and Gerald was not\r\nsurprised to find that the thing did \"not quite follow him.\"\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ a little difficult at first,\" he said. The other Ugly-Wuglies\r\nwere crowding round. The lady in the poke bonnet said--Gerald found he\r\nwas getting quite clever at understanding the conversation of those who\r\nhad no roofs to their mouths:--\r\n\r\n\"If not a hotel, a lodging.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lodging is on the cold ground,\" sang itself unhidden and unavailing\r\nin Gerald's ear. Yet stay--was it unavailing?\r\n\r\n\"I do know a lodging,\" he said slowly, \"but----\" The tallest of the\r\nUgly-Wuglies pushed forward. He was dressed in the old brown overcoat\r\nand top-hat which always hung on the school hat-stand to discourage\r\npossible burglars by deluding them into the idea that there was a\r\ngentleman-of-the-house, and that he was at home. He had an air at once\r\nmore sporting and less reserved than that of the first speaker, and any\r\none could see that he was not quite a gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"Wa I wo oo oh,\" he began, but the lady Ugly-Wugly in the\r\nflower-wreathed hat interrupted him. She spoke more distinctly than the\r\nothers, owing, as Gerald found afterwards, to the fact that her mouth\r\nhad been drawn _open_, and the flap cut from the aperture had been\r\nfolded back--so that she really had something like a roof to her mouth,\r\nthough it was only a paper one.\r\n\r\n\"What _I_ want to know,\" Gerald understood her to say, \"is where are the\r\ncarriages we ordered?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Gerald, \"but I'll find out. But we ought to be\r\nmoving,\" he added; \"you see, the performance is over, and they want to\r\nshut up the house and put the lights out. Let's be moving.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh--ech e oo-ig,\" repeated the respectable Ugly-Wugly, and stepped\r\ntowards the front door.\r\n\r\n\"Oo um oo,\" said the flower-wreathed one; and Gerald assures me that her\r\nvermilion lips stretched in a smile.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be delighted,\" said Gerald with earnest courtesy, \"to do\r\nanything, of course. Things do happen so awkwardly when you least expect\r\nit. I could go with you, and get you a lodging, if you'd only wait a few\r\nmoments in the--in the yard. It's quite a superior sort of yard,\" he\r\nwent on, as a wave of surprised disdain passed over their white paper\r\nfaces--\"not a common yard, you know; the pump,\" he added madly, \"has\r\njust been painted green all over, and the dustbin is enamelled iron.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ugly-Wuglies turned to each other in consultation, and Gerald\r\ngathered that the greenness of the pump and the enamelled character of\r\nthe dust-bin made, in their opinion, all the difference.\r\n\r\n\"I'm awfully sorry,\" he urged eagerly, \"to have to ask you to wait, but\r\nyou see I've got an uncle who's quite mad, and I have to give him his\r\ngruel at half-past nine. He won't feed out of any hand but mine.\" Gerald\r\ndid not mind what he said. The only people one is allowed to tell lies\r\nto are the Ugly-Wuglies; they are all clothes and have no insides,\r\nbecause they are not human beings, but only a sort of very real\r\nvisions, and therefore cannot be really deceived, though they may seem\r\nto be.\r\n\r\nThrough the back door that has the blue, yellow, red and green glass in\r\nit, down the iron steps into the yard, Gerald led the way, and the\r\nUgly-Wuglies trooped after him. Some of them had boots, but the ones\r\nwhose feet were only broomsticks or umbrellas found the open-work iron\r\nstairs very awkward.\r\n\r\n\"If you wouldn't _mind_,\" said Gerald, \"just waiting _under_ the\r\nbalcony? My uncle is so _very_ mad. If he were to see--see any\r\nstrangers--I mean, even aristocratic ones--I couldn't answer for the\r\nconsequences.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said the flower-hatted lady nervously, \"it would be better\r\nfor us to try and find a lodging ourselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't advise you to,\" said Gerald as grimly as he knew how; \"the\r\npolice here arrest _all_ strangers. It's the new law the Liberals have\r\njust made,\" he added convincingly, \"and you'd get the sort of lodging\r\nyou wouldn't care for--I couldn't bear to think of you in a prison\r\ndungeon,\" he added tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"I ah wi oo er papers,\" said the respectable Ugly-Wugly, and added\r\nsomething that sounded like \"disgraceful state of things.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, they ranged themselves under the iron balcony. Gerald gave one\r\nlast look at them and wondered, in his secret heart, why he was not\r\nfrightened, though in his outside mind he was congratulating himself on\r\nhis bravery. For the things did look rather horrid. In that light it\r\nwas hard to believe that they were really only clothes and pillows and\r\nsticks--with no insides. As he went up the steps he heard them talking\r\namong themselves--in that strange language of theirs, all oo's and ah's;\r\nand he thought he distinguished the voice of the respectable Ugly-Wugly\r\nsaying, \"Most gentlemanly lad,\" and the wreathed-hatted lady answering\r\nwarmly: \"Yes, indeed.\"\r\n\r\nThe coloured-glass door closed behind him. Behind him was the yard,\r\npeopled by seven impossible creatures. Before him lay the silent house,\r\npeopled, as he knew very well, by five human beings as frightened as\r\nhuman beings could be. You think, perhaps, that Ugly-Wuglies are nothing\r\nto be frightened of. That's only because you have never seen one come\r\nalive. You just make one--any old suit of your father's, and a hat that\r\nhe isn't wearing, a bolster or two, a painted paper face, a few sticks\r\nand a pair of boots will do the trick; get your father to lend you a\r\nwishing ring, give it back to him when it has done its work, and see how\r\nyou feel then.\r\n\r\nOf course the reason why Gerald was not afraid was that he had the ring;\r\nand, as you have seen, the wearer of that is not frightened by\r\n_anything_ unless he touches that thing. But Gerald knew well enough how\r\nthe others must be feeling. That was why he stopped for a moment in the\r\nhall to try and imagine what would have been most soothing to him if he\r\nhad been as terrified as he knew they were.\r\n\r\n\"Cathy! I say! What ho, Jimmy! Mabel ahoy!\" he cried in a loud, cheerful\r\nvoice that sounded very unreal to himself.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room door opened a cautious inch.\r\n\r\n\"I say--such larks!\" Gerald went on, shoving gently at the door with his\r\nshoulder. \"Look out! what are you keeping the door shut for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you--alone?\" asked Kathleen in hushed, breathless tones.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course. Don't be a duffer!\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened, revealing three scared faces and the disarranged chairs\r\nwhere that odd audience had sat.\r\n\r\n\"Where are they? Have you unwished them? We heard them talking.\r\nHorrible!\"\r\n\r\n\"They're in the yard,\" said Gerald with the best imitation of joyous\r\nexcitement that he could manage. \"It _is_ such fun! They're just like\r\nreal people, quite kind and jolly. It's the most ripping lark. Don't let\r\non to Mademoiselle and Eliza. I'll square _them_. Then Kathleen and\r\nJimmy must go to bed, and I'll see Mabel home, and as soon as we get\r\noutside I must find some sort of lodging for the Ugly-Wuglies--they\r\n_are_ such fun though. I _do_ wish you could all go with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fun?\" echoed Kathleen dismally and doubting.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly killing,\" Gerald asserted resolutely. \"Now, you just listen\r\nto what I say to Mademoiselle and Eliza, and back me up for all you're\r\nworth.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Mabel, \"you can't mean that you're going to leave me alone\r\ndirectly we get out, and go off with those horrible creatures. They look\r\nlike fiends.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wait till you've seen them close,\" Gerald advised. \"Why, they're\r\njust _ordinary_--the first thing one of them did was to ask me to\r\nrecommend it to a good hotel! I couldn't understand it at first, because\r\nit has no roof to its mouth, of course.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a mistake to say that, Gerald knew it at once.\r\n\r\nMabel and Kathleen were holding hands in a way that plainly showed how a\r\nfew moments ago they had been clinging to each other in an agony of\r\nterror. Now they clung again. And Jimmy, who was sitting on the edge of\r\nwhat had been the stage, kicking his boots against the pink counterpane,\r\nshuddered visibly.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't _matter_,\" Gerald explained--\"about the roofs, I mean; you\r\nsoon get to understand. I heard them say I was a gentlemanly lad as I\r\nwas coming away. They wouldn't have cared to notice a little thing like\r\nthat if they'd been fiends, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter how gentlemanly they think you; if you don't see me\r\nhome you _aren't_, that's all. Are you going to?\" Mabel demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am. We shall have no end of a lark. Now for Mademoiselle.\"\r\n\r\nHe had put on his coat as he spoke and now ran up the stairs. The\r\nothers, herding in the hall, could hear his light-hearted\r\nthere's-nothing-unusual-the-matter-whatever-did-you-bolt-like-that-for\r\nknock at Mademoiselle's door, the reassuring \"It's only me--Gerald, you\r\nknow,\" the pause, the opening of the door, and the low-voiced parley\r\nthat followed; then Mademoiselle and Gerald at Eliza's door, voices of\r\nreassurance; Eliza's terror, bluntly voluble, tactfully soothed.\r\n\r\n\"Wonder what lies he's telling them,\" Jimmy grumbled.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! not _lies_,\" said Mabel; \"he's only telling them as much of the\r\ntruth as it's good for them to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'd been a man,\" said Jimmy witheringly, \"you'd have been a\r\nbeastly Jesuit, and hid up chimneys.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I were only just a boy,\" Mabel retorted, \"I shouldn't be scared out\r\nof my life by a pack of old coats.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm _so_ sorry you were frightened,\" Gerald's honeyed tones floated\r\ndown the staircase; \"we didn't think about you being frightened. And it\r\n_was_ a good trick, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There!\" whispered Jimmy, \"he's been telling her it was a trick of\r\nours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, so it was,\" said Mabel stoutly.\r\n\r\n\"It was indeed a wonderful trick,\" said Mademoiselle; \"and how did you\r\nmove the mannikins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we've often done it--with strings, you know,\" Gerald explained.\r\n\r\n\"That's true, too,\" Kathleen whispered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WONDER WHAT LIES HE'S TELLING THEM,\" JIMMY GRUMBLED.]\r\n\r\n\"Let us see you do once again this trick so remarkable,\" said\r\nMademoiselle, arriving at the bottom-stair mat.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I've cleared them all out,\" said Gerald. (\"So he has,\" from\r\nKathleen aside to Jimmy.) \"We were so sorry you were startled; we\r\nthought you wouldn't like to see them again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Mademoiselle brightly, as she peeped into the untidy\r\ndining-room and saw that the figures had indeed vanished, \"if we supped\r\nand discoursed of your beautiful piece of theatre?\"\r\n\r\nGerald explained fully how much his brother and sister would enjoy this.\r\nAs for him--Mademoiselle would see that it was his duty to escort Mabel\r\nhome, and kind as it was of Mademoiselle to ask her to stay the night,\r\nit could not be, on account of the frenzied and anxious affection of\r\nMabel's aunt. And it was useless to suggest that Eliza should see Mabel\r\nhome, because Eliza was nervous at night unless accompanied by her\r\ngentleman friend.\r\n\r\nSo Mabel was hatted with her own hat and cloaked with a cloak that was\r\nnot hers; and she and Gerald went out by the front door, amid kind last\r\nwords and appointments for the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe moment that front door was shut Gerald caught Mabel by the arm and\r\nled her briskly to the corner of the side street which led to the yard.\r\nJust round the corner he stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he said, \"what I want to know is--are you an idiot or aren't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Idiot yourself!\" said Mabel, but mechanically, for she saw that he was\r\nin earnest.\r\n\r\n\"Because _I'm_ not frightened of the Ugly-Wuglies. They're as harmless\r\nas tame rabbits. But an idiot might be frightened, and give the whole\r\nshow away. If you're an idiot, say so, and I'll go back and tell them\r\nyou're afraid to walk home, and that I'll go and let your aunt know\r\nyou're stopping.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not an idiot,\" said Mabel; \"and,\" she added, glaring round her with\r\nthe wild gaze of the truly terror-stricken, \"I'm not afraid of\r\n_anything_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to let you share my difficulties and dangers,\" said Gerald;\r\n\"at least, I'm inclined to let you. I wouldn't do as much for my own\r\nbrother, I can tell you. And if you queer my pitch I'll never speak to\r\nyou again or let the others either.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a beast, that's what you are! I don't need to be threatened to\r\nmake me brave. I _am_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mabel,\" said Gerald, in low, thrilling tones, for he saw that the time\r\nhad come to sound another note, \"I _know_ you're brave. I _believe_ in\r\nyou. That's why I've arranged it like this. I'm certain you've got the\r\nheart of a lion under that black-and-white exterior. Can I trust you? To\r\nthe death?\"\r\n\r\nMabel felt that to say anything but \"Yes\" was to throw away a priceless\r\nreputation for courage. So \"Yes\" was what she said.\r\n\r\n\"Then wait here. You're close to the lamp. And when you see me coming\r\nwith _them_ remember they're as harmless as serpents--I mean doves.\r\nTalk to them just like you would to any one else. See?\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to leave her, but stopped at her natural question:\r\n\r\n\"What hotel did you say you were going to take them to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jimminy!\" the harassed Gerald caught at his hair with both hands.\r\n\"There! you see, Mabel, you're a help already\"; he had, even at that\r\nmoment, some tact left. \"I clean forgot! I meant to ask you--isn't there\r\nany lodge or anything in the Castle grounds where I could put them for\r\nthe night? The charm will break, you know, some time, like being\r\ninvisible did, and they'll just be a pack of coats and things that we\r\ncan easily carry home any day. Is there a lodge or anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a secret passage,\" Mabel began--but at that moment the\r\nyard-door opened and an Ugly-Wugly put out its head and looked anxiously\r\ndown the street.\r\n\r\n\"Righto!\"--Gerald ran to meet it. It was all Mabel could do not to run\r\nin an opposite direction with an opposite motive. It was all she could\r\ndo, but she did it, and was proud of herself as long as ever she\r\nremembered that night.\r\n\r\nAnd now, with all the silent precaution necessitated by the near\r\npresence of an extremely insane uncle, the Ugly-Wuglies, a grisly band,\r\ntrooped out of the yard door.\r\n\r\n\"Walk on your toes, dear,\" the bonneted Ugly-Wugly whispered to the one\r\nwith a wreath; and even at that thrilling crisis Gerald wondered how she\r\ncould, since the toes of one foot were but the end of a golf club and of\r\nthe other the end of a hockey-stick.\r\n\r\nMabel felt that there was no shame in retreating to the lamp-post at the\r\nstreet corner, but, once there, she made herself halt--and no one but\r\nMabel will ever know how much making that took. Think of it--to stand\r\nthere, firm and quiet, and wait for those hollow, unbelievable things to\r\ncome up to her, clattering on the pavement with their stumpy feet or\r\nborne along noiselessly, as in the case of the flower-hatted lady, by a\r\nskirt that touched the ground, and had, Mabel knew very well, nothing at\r\nall inside it.\r\n\r\nShe stood very still; the insides of her hands grew cold and damp, but\r\nstill she stood, saying over and over again: \"They're not true--they\r\ncan't be true. It's only a dream--they aren't really true. They can't\r\nbe.\" And then Gerald was there, and all the Ugly-Wuglies crowding round,\r\nand Gerald saying:--\r\n\r\n\"This is one of our friends, Mabel--the Princess in the play, you know.\r\nBe a man!\" he added in a whisper for her ear alone.\r\n\r\nMabel, all her nerves stretched tight as banjo strings, had an awful\r\ninstant of not knowing whether she would be able to be a man or whether\r\nshe would be merely a shrieking and running little mad girl. For the\r\nrespectable Ugly-Wugly shook her limply by the hand (\"He _can't_ be\r\ntrue,\" she told herself), and the rose-wreathed one took her arm with a\r\nsoft-padded glove at the end of an umbrella arm, and said:--\r\n\r\n\"You dear, clever little thing! _Do_ walk with me!\" in a gushing,\r\ngirlish way, and in speech almost wholly lacking in consonants.\r\n\r\nThen they all walked up the High Street as if, as Gerald said, they were\r\nanybody else.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange procession, but Liddlesby goes early to bed, and the\r\nLiddlesby police, in common with those of most other places, wear boots\r\nthat one can hear a mile off. If such boots had been heard, Gerald would\r\nhave had time to turn back and head them off. He felt now that he could\r\nnot resist a flush of pride in Mabel's courage as he heard her polite\r\nrejoinders to the still more polite remarks of the amiable Ugly-Wuglies.\r\nHe did not know how near she was to the scream that would throw away the\r\nwhole thing and bring the police and the residents out to the ruin of\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\nThey met no one, except one man, who murmured, \"Guy Fawkes, swelp me!\"\r\nand crossed the road hurriedly; and when, next day, he told what he had\r\nseen, his wife disbelieved him, and also said it was a judgment on him,\r\nwhich was unreasonable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IT WAS A STRANGE PROCESSION.]\r\n\r\nMabel felt as though she were taking part in a very completely arranged\r\nnightmare, but Gerald was in it too, Gerald, who had asked if she was an\r\nidiot. Well, she wasn't. But she soon would be, she felt. Yet she went\r\non answering the courteous vowel-talk of these impossible people. She\r\nhad often heard her aunt speak of impossible people. Well, now she\r\nknew what they were like.\r\n\r\nSummer twilight had melted into summer moonlight. The shadows of the\r\nUgly-Wuglies on the white road were much more horrible than their more\r\nsolid selves. Mabel wished it had been a dark night, and then corrected\r\nthe wish with a hasty shudder.\r\n\r\nGerald, submitting to a searching interrogatory from the tall-hatted\r\nUgly-Wugly as to his schools, his sports, pastimes, and ambitions,\r\nwondered how long the spell would last. The ring seemed to work in\r\nsevens. Would these things have seven hours' life--or fourteen--or\r\ntwenty-one? His mind lost itself in the intricacies of the seven-times\r\ntable (a teaser at the best of times) and only found itself with a shock\r\nwhen the procession found _itself_ at the gates of the Castle grounds.\r\n\r\nLocked--of course.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he explained, as the Ugly-Wuglies vainly shook the iron gates\r\nwith incredible hands; \"it's so very late. There _is_ another way. But\r\nyou have to climb through a hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ladies,\" the respectable Ugly-Wugly began objecting; but the ladies\r\nwith one voice affirmed that they loved adventures. \"So frightfully\r\nthrilling,\" added the one who wore roses.\r\n\r\nSo they went round by the road, and coming to the hole--it was a little\r\ndifficult to find in the moonlight, which always disguises the most\r\nfamiliar things--Gerald went first with the bicycle lantern which he\r\nhad snatched as his pilgrims came out of the yard; the shrinking Mabel\r\nfollowed, and then the Ugly-Wuglies, with hollow rattlings of their\r\nwooden limbs against the stone, crept through, and with strange\r\nvowel-sounds of general amazement, manly courage, and feminine\r\nnervousness, followed the light along the passage through the fern-hung\r\ncutting and under the arch.\r\n\r\nWhen they emerged on the moonlit enchantment of the Italian garden a\r\nquite intelligible \"Oh!\" of surprised admiration broke from more than\r\none painted paper lip; and the respectable Ugly-Wugly was understood to\r\nsay that it must be quite a show-place--by George, sir! yes.\r\n\r\nThose marble terraces and artfully serpentining gravel walks surely\r\nnever had echoed to steps so strange. No shadows so wildly unbelievable\r\nhad, for all its enchantments, ever fallen on those smooth, gray, dewy\r\nlawns. Gerald was thinking this, or something like it (what he really\r\nthought was, \"I bet there never was such a go as this, even here!\"),\r\nwhen he saw the statue of Hermes leap from its pedestal and run towards\r\nhim and his company with all the lively curiosity of a street boy eager\r\nto be in at a street fight. He saw, too, that he was the only one who\r\nperceived that white advancing presence. And he knew that it was the\r\nring that let him see what by others could not be seen. He slipped it\r\nfrom his finger. Yes; Hermes was on his pedestal, still as the snow man\r\nyou make in the Christmas holidays. He put the ring on again, and there\r\nwas Hermes, circling round the group and gazing deep in each unconscious\r\nUgly-Wugly face.\r\n\r\n\"This seems a very superior hotel,\" the tall-hatted Ugly-Wugly was\r\nsaying; \"the grounds are laid out with what you might call taste.\"\r\n\r\n\"We should have to go in by the back door,\" said Mabel suddenly. \"The\r\nfront door's locked at half-past nine.\"\r\n\r\nA short, stout Ugly-Wugly in a yellow and blue cricket cap, who had\r\nhardly spoken, muttered something about an escapade, and about feeling\r\nquite young again.\r\n\r\nAnd now they had skirted the marble-edged pool where the gold fish swam\r\nand glimmered, and where the great prehistoric beast had come down to\r\nbathe and drink. The water flashed white diamonds in the moonlight, and\r\nGerald alone of them all saw that the scaly-plated vast lizard was even\r\nnow rolling and wallowing there among the lily pads.\r\n\r\nThey hastened up the steps of the Temple of Flora. The back of it, where\r\nno elegant arch opened to the air, was against one of those sheer hills,\r\nalmost cliffs, that diversified the landscape of that garden. Mabel\r\npassed behind the statue of the goddess, fumbled a little, and then\r\nGerald's lantern, flashing like a search-light, showed a very high and\r\nvery narrow doorway: the stone that was the door, and that had closed\r\nit, revolved slowly under the touch of Mabel's fingers.\r\n\r\n\"This way,\" she said, and panted a little. The back of her neck felt\r\ncold and goose-fleshy.\r\n\r\n\"You lead the way, my lad, with the lantern,\" said the suburban\r\nUgly-Wugly in his bluff, agreeable way.\r\n\r\n\"I--I must, stay behind to close the door,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"The Princess can do that. _We'll_ help her,\" said the wreathed one with\r\neffusion; and Gerald thought her horribly officious.\r\n\r\nHe insisted gently that he would be the one responsible for the safe\r\nshutting of that door.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't like me to get into trouble, I'm sure,\" he urged; and the\r\nUgly-Wuglies, for the last time kind and reasonable, agreed that this,\r\nof all things, they would most deplore.\r\n\r\n\"_You_ take it,\" Gerald urged, pressing the bicycle lamp on the elderly\r\nUgly-Wugly; \"you're the natural leader. Go straight ahead. Are there any\r\nsteps?\" he asked Mabel in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Not for ever so long,\" she whispered back. \"It goes on for ages, and\r\nthen twists round.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whispering,\" said the smallest Ugly-Wugly suddenly, \"ain't manners.\"\r\n\r\n\"_He_ hasn't any, anyhow,\" whispered the lady Ugly-Wugly; \"don't mind\r\nhim--quite a self-made man,\" and squeezed Mabel's arm with horrible\r\nconfidential flabbiness.\r\n\r\nThe respectable Ugly-Wugly leading with the lamp, the others following\r\ntrustfully, one and all disappeared into that narrow doorway; and Gerald\r\nand Mabel standing without, hardly daring to breathe lest a breath\r\nshould retard the procession, almost sobbed with relief. Prematurely, as\r\nit turned out. For suddenly there was a rush and a scuffle inside the\r\npassage, and as they strove to close the door the Ugly-Wuglies fiercely\r\npressed to open it again. Whether they saw something in the dark passage\r\nthat alarmed them, whether they took it into their empty heads that this\r\ncould not be the back way to any really respectable hotel, or whether a\r\nconvincing sudden instinct warned them that they were being tricked,\r\nMabel and Gerald never knew. But they knew that the Ugly-Wuglies were no\r\nlonger friendly and commonplace, that a fierce change had come over\r\nthem. Cries of \"No, No!\" \"We won't go on!\" \"Make _him_ lead!\" broke the\r\ndreamy stillness of the perfect night. There were screams from ladies'\r\nvoices, the hoarse, determined shouts of strong Ugly-Wuglies roused to\r\nresistance, and, worse than all, the steady pushing open of that narrow\r\nstone door that had almost closed upon the ghastly crew. Through the\r\nchink of it they could be seen, a writhing black crowd against the light\r\nof the bicycle lamp; a padded hand reached round the door; stick-boned\r\narms stretched out angrily towards the world that that door, if it\r\nclosed, would shut them off from for ever. And the tone of their\r\nconsonantless speech was no longer conciliatory and ordinary; it was\r\nthreatening, full of the menace of unbearable horrors.\r\n\r\nThe padded hand fell on Gerald's arm, and instantly all the terrors\r\nthat he had, so far, only known in imagination became real to him, and\r\nhe saw, in the sort of flash that shows drowning people their past\r\nlives, what it was that he had asked of Mabel, and that she had given.\r\n\r\n\"Push, push for your life!\" he cried, and setting his heel against the\r\npedestal of Flora, pushed manfully.\r\n\r\n\"I can't any more--oh. I can't!\" moaned Mabel, and tried to use her heel\r\nlikewise, but her legs were too short.\r\n\r\n\"They mustn't get out, they mustn't!\" Gerald panted.\r\n\r\n\"You'll know it when we do,\" came from inside the door in tones which\r\nfury and mouth-rooflessness would have made unintelligible to any ears\r\nbut those sharpened by the wild fear of that unspeakable moment.\r\n\r\n\"What's up, there?\" cried suddenly a new voice--a voice with all its\r\nconsonants comforting, clean-cut, and ringing, and abruptly a new shadow\r\nfell on the marble floor of Flora's temple.\r\n\r\n\"Come and help push!\" Gerald's voice only just reached the newcomer. \"If\r\nthey get out they'll kill us all.\"\r\n\r\nA strong, velveteen-covered shoulder pushed suddenly between the\r\nshoulders of Gerald and Mabel; a stout man's heel sought the aid of the\r\ngoddess's pedestal; the heavy, narrow door yielded slowly, it closed,\r\nits spring clicked, and the furious, surging, threatening mass of\r\nUgly-Wuglies was shut in, and Gerald and Mabel--oh, incredible\r\nrelief!--were shut out. Mabel threw herself on the marble floor, sobbing\r\nslow, heavy sobs of achievement and exhaustion. If I had been there I\r\nshould have looked the other way, so as not to see whether Gerald\r\nyielded himself to the same abandonment.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer he appeared to be a gamekeeper, Gerald decided\r\nlater--looked down on--well, certainly on Mabel, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Come on, don't be a little duffer.\" (He may have said, \"a couple of\r\nlittle duffers.\") \"Who is it, and what's it all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't possibly tell you,\" Gerald panted.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to see about that, shan't we,\" said the newcomer amiably.\r\n\"Come out into the moonlight and let's review the situation.\"\r\n\r\nGerald, even in that topsy-turvy state of his world, found time to think\r\nthat a gamekeeper who used such words as that had most likely a romantic\r\npast. But at the same time he saw that such a man would be far less easy\r\nto \"square\" with an unconvincing tale than Eliza, or Johnson, or even\r\nMademoiselle. In fact, he seemed, with the only tale that they had to\r\ntell, practically unsquarable.\r\n\r\nGerald got up--if he was not up already, or still up--and pulled at the\r\nlimp and now hot hand of the sobbing Mabel; and as he did so the\r\nunsquarable one took _his_ hand, and thus led both children out from\r\nunder the shadow of Flora's dome into the bright white moonlight that\r\ncarpeted Flora's steps. Here he sat down, a child on each side of him,\r\ndrew a hand of each through his velveteen arm, pressed them to his\r\nvelveteen sides in a friendly, reassuring way, and said: \"Now then! Go\r\nahead!\"\r\n\r\nMabel merely sobbed. We must excuse her. She had been very brave, and I\r\nhave no doubt that all heroines, from Joan of Arc to Grace Darling, have\r\nhad their sobbing moments.\r\n\r\nBut Gerald said: \"It's no use. If I made up a story you'd see through\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a compliment to my discernment, anyhow,\" said the stranger.\r\n\"What price telling me the truth?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we told you the truth,\" said Gerald, \"you wouldn't believe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try me,\" said the velveteen one. He was clean-shaven, and had large\r\neyes that sparkled when the moonlight touched them.\r\n\r\n\"I _can't_,\" said Gerald, and it was plain that he spoke the truth.\r\n\"You'd either think we were mad, and get us shut up, or else--oh, it's\r\nno good. Thank you for helping us, and do let us go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said the stranger musingly, \"whether you have any\r\nimagination.\"\r\n\r\n\"Considering that we invented them,\" Gerald hotly began, and stopped\r\nwith late prudence.\r\n\r\n\"If by 'them' you mean the people whom I helped you to imprison in\r\nyonder tomb,\" said the stranger, loosing Mabel's hand to put his arm\r\nround her, \"remember that I saw and heard them. And with all respect to\r\nyour imagination, I doubt whether any invention of yours would be quite\r\nso convincing.\"\r\n\r\nGerald put his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Collect yourself,\" said the one in velveteen; \"and while you are\r\ncollecting, let me just put the thing from my point of view. I think you\r\nhardly realise my position. I come down from London to take care of a\r\nbig estate.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _thought_ you were a gamekeeper,\" put in Gerald.\r\n\r\nMabel put her head on the stranger's shoulder. \"Hero in disguise, then,\r\n_I_ know,\" she sniffed.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said he; \"bailiff would be nearer the mark. On the very\r\nfirst evening I go out to take the moonlit air, and approaching a white\r\nbuilding, hear sounds of an agitated scuffle, accompanied by frenzied\r\nappeals for assistance. Carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, I\r\n_do_ assist and shut up goodness knows who behind a stone door. Now, is\r\nit unreasonable that I should ask who it is that I've shut up--helped to\r\nshut up, I mean, and who it is that I've assisted?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's reasonable enough,\" Gerald admitted.\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" said the stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" said Gerald, \"the fact is---- No,\" he added after a pause,\r\n\"the fact is, I simply can't tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I must ask the other side,\" said Velveteens. \"Let me go--I'll undo\r\nthat door and find out for myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him,\" said Mabel, speaking for the first time. \"Never mind if he\r\nbelieves or not. We can't have them let out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Gerald, \"I'll tell him. Now look here, Mr. Bailiff,\r\nwill you promise us on an English gentleman's word of honour--because,\r\nof course, I can see you're _that_, bailiff or not--will you promise\r\nthat you won't tell any one what we tell you and that you won't have us\r\nput in a lunatic asylum, however mad we sound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the stranger, \"I think I can promise that. But if you've\r\nbeen having a sham fight or anything and shoved the other side into that\r\nhole, don't you think you'd better let them out? They'll be most awfully\r\nfrightened, you know. After all, I suppose they are only children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait till you hear,\" Gerald answered. \"They're not children--not much!\r\nShall I just tell about them or begin at the beginning?\"\r\n\r\n\"The beginning, of course,\" said the stranger.\r\n\r\nMabel lifted her head from his velveteen shoulder and said, \"Let me\r\nbegin, then. I found a ring, and I said it would make me invisible. I\r\nsaid it in play. And it _did_. I was invisible twenty-one hours. Never\r\nmind where I got the ring. Now, Gerald, you go on.\"\r\n\r\nGerald went on; for quite a long time he went on, for the story was a\r\nsplendid one to tell.\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" he ended, \"we got them in there; and when seven hours are\r\nover, or fourteen, or twenty-one, or something with a seven in it,\r\nthey'll just be old coats again. They came alive at half-past nine. _I_\r\nthink they'll stop being it in seven hours--that's half-past four.\r\n_Now_ will you let us go home?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see you home,\" said the stranger in a quite new tone of\r\nexasperating gentleness. \"Come--let's be going.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't believe us,\" said Gerald. \"Of course you don't. Nobody could.\r\nBut I could make you believe if I chose.\"\r\n\r\nAll three stood up, and the stranger stared in Gerald's eyes till Gerald\r\nanswered his thought.\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't look mad, do I?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you aren't. But, come, you're an extraordinarily sensible boy;\r\ndon't you think you may be sickening for a fever or something?\"\r\n\r\n\"And Cathy and Jimmy and Mademoiselle and Eliza, and the man who said\r\n'Guy Fawkes, swelp me!' and _you_, you saw them move--you heard them\r\ncall out. Are you sickening for anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--or at least not for anything but information. Come, and I'll see\r\nyou home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mabel lives at the Towers,\" said Gerald, as the stranger turned into\r\nthe broad drive that leads to the big gate.\r\n\r\n\"No relation to Lord Yalding,\" said Mabel hastily--\"housekeeper's\r\nniece.\" She was holding on to his hand all the way. At the servants'\r\nentrance she put up her face to be kissed, and went in.\r\n\r\n\"Poor little thing!\" said the bailiff, as they went down the drive\r\ntowards the gate.\r\n\r\nHe went with Gerald to the door of the school.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Gerald at parting. \"I know what you're going to do.\r\nYou're going to try to undo that door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Discerning!\" said the stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Well--don't. Or, any way, wait till daylight and let us be there. We\r\ncan get there by ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right--I'll meet you there by ten,\" answered the stranger. \"By\r\nGeorge! you're the rummest kids I ever met.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are rum,\" Gerald owned, \"but so would you be if---- Good night.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the four children went over the smooth lawn towards Flora's Temple\r\nthey talked, as they had talked all the morning, about the adventures of\r\nlast night and of Mabel's bravery. It was not ten, but half-past twelve;\r\nfor Eliza, backed by Mademoiselle, had insisted on their \"clearing up,\"\r\nand clearing up very thoroughly, the \"litter\" of last night.\r\n\r\n\"You're a Victoria Cross heroine, dear,\" said Cathy warmly. \"You ought\r\nto have a statue put up to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would come alive if you put it here,\" said Gerald grimly.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ shouldn't have been afraid,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"By daylight,\" Gerald assured him, \"everything looks so jolly\r\ndifferent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do hope he'll be there,\" Mabel said; \"he _was_ such a dear, Cathy--a\r\nperfect bailiff, with the soul of a gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PAINTED POINTED PAPER FACE PEERED OUT.]\r\n\r\n\"He isn't there, though,\" said Jimmy. \"I believe you just dreamed him,\r\nlike you did the statues coming alive.\"\r\n\r\nThey went up the marble steps in the sunshine, and it was difficult to\r\nbelieve that this was the place where only in last night's moonlight\r\nfear had laid such cold hands on the hearts of Mabel and Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we open the door,\" suggested Kathleen, \"and begin to carry home\r\nthe coats?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's listen first,\" said Gerald; \"perhaps they aren't only coats yet.\"\r\n\r\nThey laid ears to the hinges of the stone door, behind which last night\r\nthe Ugly-Wuglies had shrieked and threatened. All was still as the sweet\r\nmorning itself. It was as they turned away that they saw the man they\r\nhad come to meet. He was on the other side of Flora's pedestal. But he\r\nwas not standing up. He lay there, quite still, on his back, his arms\r\nflung wide.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, look!\" cried Cathy, and pointed. His face was a queer greenish\r\ncolour, and on his forehead there was a cut; its edges were blue, and a\r\nlittle blood had trickled from it on to the white of the marble.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Mabel pointed too--but she did not cry out as Cathy had\r\ndone. And what she pointed at was a big glossy-leaved rhododendron bush,\r\nfrom which a painted pointed paper face peered out--very white, very\r\nred, in the sunlight--and, as the children gazed, shrank back into the\r\ncover of the shining leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was but too plain. The unfortunate bailiff must have opened the door\r\nbefore the spell had faded, while yet the Ugly-Wuglies were something\r\nmore than mere coats and hats and sticks. They had rushed out upon him,\r\nand had done this. He lay there insensible--was it a golf-club or a\r\nhockey-stick that had made that horrible cut on his forehead? Gerald\r\nwondered. The girls had rushed to the sufferer; already his head was in\r\nMabel's lap. Kathleen had tried to get it on to hers, but Mabel was too\r\nquick for her.\r\n\r\nJimmy and Gerald both knew what was the first thing needed by the\r\nunconscious, even before Mabel impatiently said: \"Water! water!\"\r\n\r\n\"What in?\" Jimmy asked, looking doubtfully at his hands, and then down\r\nthe green slope to the marble-bordered pool where the water-lilies were.\r\n\r\n\"Your hat--anything,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\nThe two boys turned away.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they come after us,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"_What_ come after us?\" Gerald snapped rather than asked.\r\n\r\n\"The Ugly-Wuglies,\" Jimmy whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Who's afraid?\" Gerald inquired.\r\n\r\nBut he looked to right and left very carefully, and chose the way that\r\ndid not lead near the bushes. He scooped water up in his straw hat and\r\nreturned to Flora's Temple, carrying it carefully in both hands. When he\r\nsaw how quickly it ran through the straw he pulled his handkerchief from\r\nhis breast pocket with his teeth and dropped it into the hat. It was\r\nwith this that the girls wiped the blood from the bailiff's brow.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to have smelling salts,\" said Kathleen, half in tears. \"I know\r\nwe ought.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would be good,\" Mabel owned.\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't your aunt any?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but----\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a coward,\" said Gerald; \"think of last night. _They_ wouldn't\r\nhurt you. He must have insulted them or something. Look here, you run.\r\nWe'll see that nothing runs after you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no choice but to relinquish the head of the interesting\r\ninvalid to Kathleen; so Mabel did it, cast one glaring glance round the\r\nrhododendron bordered slope, and fled towards the castle.\r\n\r\nThe other three bent over the still unconscious bailiff.\r\n\r\n\"He's not dead, is he?\" asked Jimmy anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Kathleen reassured him, \"his heart's beating. Mabel and I felt it\r\nin his wrist, where doctors do. How frightfully good-looking he is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so dusty,\" Gerald admitted.\r\n\r\n\"I never know what you mean by good-looking,\" said Jimmy, and suddenly a\r\nshadow fell on the marble beside them and a fourth voice spoke--not\r\nMabel's; her hurrying figure, though still in sight, was far away.\r\n\r\n\"Quite a personable young man,\" it said.\r\n\r\nThe children looked up--into the face of the eldest of the Ugly-Wuglies,\r\nthe respectable one. Jimmy and Kathleen screamed. I am sorry, but they\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said Gerald savagely: he was still wearing the ring. \"Hold your\r\ntongues! I'll get him away,\" he added in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Very sad affair this,\" said the respectable Ugly-Wugly. He spoke with a\r\ncurious accent; there was something odd about his r's, and his m's and\r\nn's were those of a person labouring under an almost intolerable cold in\r\nthe head. But it was not the dreadful \"oo\" and \"ah\" voice of the night\r\nbefore. Kathleen and Jimmy stooped over the bailiff. Even that prostrate\r\nform, being human, seemed some little protection. But Gerald, strong in\r\nthe fearlessness that the ring gave to its wearer, looked full into the\r\nface of the Ugly-Wugly--and started. For though the face was almost the\r\nsame as the face he had himself painted on the school drawing-paper, it\r\nwas not the same. For it was no longer paper. It was a real face, and\r\nthe hands, lean and almost transparent as they were, were real hands.\r\nAs it moved a little to get a better view of the bailiff it was plain\r\nthat it had legs, arms--live legs and arms, and a self-supporting\r\nbackbone. It was alive indeed--with a vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"How did it happen?\" Gerald asked with an effort at calmness--a\r\nsuccessful effort.\r\n\r\n\"Most regrettable,\" said the Ugly-Wugly. \"The others must have missed\r\nthe way last night in the passage. They never found the hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did _you_?\" asked Gerald blankly.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said the Ugly-Wugly. \"Most respectable, exactly as you\r\nsaid. Then when I came away--I didn't come the front way because I\r\nwanted to revisit this sylvan scene by daylight, and the hotel people\r\ndidn't seem to know how to direct me to it--I found the others all at\r\nthis door, very angry. They'd been here all night, trying to get out.\r\nThen the door opened--this gentleman must have opened it--and before I\r\ncould protect him, that underbred man in the high hat--you remember----\"\r\n\r\nGerald remembered.\r\n\r\n\"Hit him on the head, and he fell where you see him. The others\r\ndispersed, and I myself was just going for assistance when I saw you.\"\r\n\r\nHere Jimmy was discovered to be in tears and Kathleen white as any\r\ndrawing-paper.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, my little man?\" said the respectable Ugly-Wugly\r\nkindly. Jimmy passed instantly from tears to yells.\r\n\r\n\"Here, take the ring!\" said Gerald in a furious whisper, and thrust it\r\non to Jimmy's hot, damp, resisting finger. Jimmy's voice stopped short\r\nin the middle of a howl. And Gerald in a cold flash realised what it was\r\nthat Mabel had gone through the night before. But it was daylight, and\r\nGerald was not a coward.\r\n\r\n\"We must find the others,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I imagine,\" said the elderly Ugly-Wugly, \"that they have gone to bathe.\r\nTheir clothes are in the wood.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"You two go and see,\" said Gerald. \"I'll go on dabbing this chap's\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nIn the wood Jimmy, now fearless as any lion, discovered four heaps of\r\nclothing, with broomsticks, hockey-sticks, and masks complete, all that\r\nhad gone to make up the gentlemen Ugly-Wuglies of the night before. On a\r\nstone seat well in the sun sat the two lady Ugly-Wuglies, and Kathleen\r\napproached them gingerly. Valour is easier in the sunshine than at\r\nnight, as we all know. When she and Jimmy came close to the bench, they\r\nsaw that the Ugly-Wuglies were only Ugly-Wuglies such as they had often\r\nmade. There was no life in them. Jimmy shook them to pieces, and a sigh\r\nof relief burst from Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"The spell's broken, you see,\" she said; \"and that old gentleman, he's\r\nreal. He only happens to be like the Ugly-Wugly we made.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's got the coat that hung in the hall on, anyway,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JIMMY SHOOK THEM TO PIECES.]\r\n\r\n\"No, it's only like it. Let's get back to the unconscious stranger.\"\r\n\r\nThey did, and Gerald begged the elderly Ugly-Wugly to retire among the\r\nbushes with Jimmy; \"because,\" said he, \"I think the poor bailiff's\r\ncoming round, and it might upset him to see strangers--and Jimmy'll keep\r\nyou company. He's the best one of us to go with you,\" he added hastily.\r\n\r\nAnd this, since Jimmy had the ring, was certainly true.\r\n\r\nSo the two disappeared behind the rhododendrons. Mabel came back with\r\nthe salts just as the bailiff opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"It's just like life,\" she said; \"I might just as well not have gone.\r\nHowever----\" She knelt down at once and held the bottle under the\r\nsufferer's nose till he sneezed and feebly pushed her hand away with the\r\nfaint question:\r\n\r\n\"What's up now?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've hurt your head,\" said Gerald. \"Lie still.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--more--smelling-bottle,\" he said weakly, and lay.\r\n\r\nQuite soon he sat up and looked round him. There was an anxious silence.\r\nHere was a grown-up who knew last night's secret, and none of the\r\nchildren were at all sure what the utmost rigour of the law might be in\r\na case where people, no matter how young, made Ugly-Wuglies, and brought\r\nthem to life--dangerous, fighting, angry life. What would he say--what\r\nwould he do? He said: \"What an odd thing! Have I been insensible long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hours,\" said Mabel earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Not long,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"We don't know. We found you like it,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right now,\" said the bailiff, and his eye fell on the\r\nblood-stained handkerchief. \"I say, I did give my head a bang. And\r\nyou've been giving me first aid. Thank you most awfully. But it is rum.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's rum?\" politeness obliged Gerald to ask.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose it isn't really rum--I expect I saw you just before I\r\nfainted, or whatever it was--but I've dreamed the most extraordinary\r\ndream while I've been insensible, and you were in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but us?\" asked Mabel breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, lots of things--impossible things--but _you_ were real enough.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one breathed deeply in relief. It was indeed, as they agreed\r\nlater, a lucky let-off.\r\n\r\n\"Are you _sure_ you're all right?\" they all asked, as he got on his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly, thank you.\" He glanced behind Flora's statue as he spoke.\r\n\"Do you know, I dreamed there was a door there, but of course there\r\nisn't. I don't know how to thank you,\" he added, looking at them with\r\nwhat the girls called his beautiful, kind eyes; \"it's lucky for me you\r\ncame along. You come here whenever you like, you know,\" he added. \"I\r\ngive you the freedom of the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the new bailiff, aren't you?\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. How did you know?\" he asked quickly; but they did not tell him how\r\nthey knew. Instead, they found out which way he was going, and went the\r\nother way after warm hand-shakes and hopes on both sides that they would\r\nmeet again soon.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what,\" said Gerald, as they watched the tall, broad\r\nfigure of the bailiff grow smaller across the hot green of the grass\r\nslope, \"have you got any idea of how we're going to spend the day?\r\nBecause I have.\"\r\n\r\nThe others hadn't.\r\n\r\n\"We'll get rid of that Ugly-Wugly--oh, we'll find a way right\r\nenough--and directly we've done it we'll go home and seal up the ring in\r\nan envelope so that its teeth'll be drawn and it'll be powerless to have\r\nunforeseen larks with us. Then we'll get out on the roof, and have a\r\nquiet day--books and apples. I'm about fed up with adventures, so I tell\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe others told him the same thing.\r\n\r\n\"Now, _think_,\" said he--\"think as you never thought before--how to get\r\nrid of that Ugly-Wugly.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one thought, but their brains were tired with anxiety and\r\ndistress, and the thoughts they thought were, as Mabel said, not worth\r\nthinking, let alone saying.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose Jimmy's all right,\" said Kathleen anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _he's_ all right: he's got the ring,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"I hope he won't go wishing anything rotten,\" said Mabel, but Gerald\r\nurged her to shut up and let him think.\r\n\r\n\"I think I think best sitting down,\" he said, and sat; \"and sometimes\r\nyou can think best aloud. The Ugly-Wugly's _real_--don't make any\r\nmistake about that. And he got made real inside that passage. If we\r\ncould get him back there he might get changed again, and then we could\r\ntake the coats and things back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there any other way?\" Kathleen asked; and Mabel, more candid,\r\nsaid bluntly: \"I'm not going into that passage, so there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Afraid! In broad daylight,\" Gerald sneered.\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't be broad daylight in there,\" said Mabel, and Kathleen\r\nshivered.\r\n\r\n\"If we went to him and suddenly tore his coat off,\" said she--\"he _is_\r\nonly coats--he couldn't go on being real then.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Couldn't_ he!\" said Gerald. \"You don't know what he's like under the\r\ncoat.\"\r\n\r\nKathleen shivered again. And all this time the sun was shining gaily and\r\nthe white statues and the green trees and the fountains and terraces\r\nlooked as cheerfully romantic as a scene in a play.\r\n\r\n\"Any way,\" said Gerald, \"we'll try to get him back, and shut the door.\r\nThat's the most we can hope for. And then apples, and 'Robinson Crusoe'\r\nor the 'Swiss Family,' or any book you like that's got no magic in it.\r\nNow, we've just got to do it. And he's not horrid now; _really_ he\r\nisn't. He's real, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that makes all the difference,\" said Mabel, and tried to feel\r\nthat perhaps it did.\r\n\r\n\"And it's broad daylight--just look at the sun,\" Gerald insisted. \"Come\r\non!\"\r\n\r\nHe took a hand of each, and they walked resolutely towards the bank of\r\nrhododendrons behind which Jimmy and the Ugly-Wugly had been told to\r\nwait, and as they went Gerald said: \"He's real\"--\"The sun's\r\nshining\"--\"It'll all be over in a minute.\" And he said these things\r\nagain and again, so that there should be no mistake about them.\r\n\r\nAs they neared the bushes the shining leaves rustled, shivered, and\r\nparted, and before the girls had time to begin to hang back Jimmy came\r\nblinking out into the sunlight. The boughs closed behind him, and they\r\ndid not stir or rustle for the appearance of any one else. Jimmy was\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\" asked the girls in one breath.\r\n\r\n\"Walking up and down in a fir-walk,\" said Jimmy, \"doing sums in a book.\r\nHe says he's most frightfully rich, and he's got to get up to town to\r\nthe Stocks or something--where they change papers into gold if you're\r\nclever, he says. I should like to go to the Stocks-change, wouldn't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't seem to care very much about changes,\" said Gerald. \"I've had\r\nenough. Show us where he is--we must get rid of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's got a motor-car,\" Jimmy went on, parting the warm\r\nvarnished-looking rhododendron leaves, \"and a garden with a tennis-court\r\nand a lake and a carriage and pair, and he goes to Athens for his\r\nholiday sometimes, just like other people go to Margate.\"\r\n\r\n\"The best thing,\" said Gerald, following through the bushes, \"will be to\r\ntell him the shortest way out is through that hotel that he thinks he\r\nfound last night. Then we get him into the passage, give him a push, fly\r\nback, and shut the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll starve to death in there,\" said Kathleen, \"if he's really real.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect it doesn't last long, the ring magics don't--anyway, it's the\r\nonly thing I can think of.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's frightfully rich,\" Jimmy went on unheeding amid the cracking of\r\nthe bushes; \"he's building a public library for the people where he\r\nlives, and having his portrait painted to put in it. He thinks they'll\r\nlike that.\"\r\n\r\nThe belt of rhododendrons was passed, and the children had reached a\r\nsmooth grass walk bordered by tall pines and firs of strange different\r\nkinds. \"He's just round that corner,\" said Jimmy. \"He's simply rolling\r\nin money. He doesn't know what to do with it. He's been building a\r\nhorse-trough and drinking fountain with a bust of himself on top. Why\r\ndoesn't he build a private swimming-bath close to his bed, so that he\r\ncan just roll off into it of a morning? I wish _I_ was rich; I'd soon\r\nshow him----\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a sensible wish,\" said Gerald. \"I wonder we didn't think of\r\ndoing that. Oh, criky!\" he added, and with reason. For there, in the\r\ngreen shadows of the pine-walk, in the woodland silence, broken only by\r\nrustling leaves and the agitated breathing of the three unhappy others,\r\nJimmy got his wish. By quick but perfectly plain-to-be-seen degrees\r\nJimmy became rich. And the horrible thing was that though they could see\r\nit happening they did not know what was happening, and could not have\r\nstopped it if they had. All they could see was Jimmy, their own Jimmy,\r\nwhom they had larked with and quarrelled with and made it up with ever\r\nsince they could remember, Jimmy continuously and horribly growing old.\r\nThe whole thing was over in a few seconds. Yet in those few seconds they\r\nsaw him grow to a youth, a young man, a middle-aged man; and then, with\r\na sort of shivering shock, unspeakably horrible and definite, he seemed\r\nto settle down into an elderly gentleman, handsomely but rather dowdily\r\ndressed, who was looking down at them through spectacles and asking them\r\nthe nearest way to the railway-station. If they had not seen the change\r\ntake place, in all its awful details, they would never have guessed that\r\nthis stout, prosperous, elderly gentleman with the high hat, the\r\nfrock-coat, and the large red seal dangling from the curve of a portly\r\nwaistcoat, was their own Jimmy. But, as they _had_ seen it, they knew\r\nthe dreadful truth.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jimmy, _don't_!\" cried Mabel desperately.\r\n\r\nGerald said: \"This is perfectly beastly,\" and Kathleen broke into wild\r\nweeping.\r\n\r\n\"Don't cry, little girl!\" said That-which-had-been-Jimmy; \"and you, boy,\r\ncan't you give a civil answer to a civil question?\"\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't know us!\" wailed Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Who doesn't know you?\" said That-which-had-been impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Y--y--_you_ don't!\" Kathleen sobbed.\r\n\r\n\"I certainly don't,\" returned That-which----\"but surely that need not\r\ndistress you so deeply.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy!\" Kathleen sobbed louder than before.\r\n\r\n\"He _doesn't_ know us,\" Gerald owned, \"or--look here, Jimmy, y--you\r\naren't kidding, are you? Because if you are it's simply abject rot----\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Mr. ----,\" said That-which-had-been-Jimmy, and gave the name\r\ncorrectly. By the way, it will perhaps be shorter to call this elderly\r\nstout person who was Jimmy grown rich by some simpler name than I have\r\njust used. Let us call him \"That\"--short for \"That-which-had-been-Jimmy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What _are_ we to do?\" whispered Mabel, awestruck; and aloud she said:\r\n\"Oh, Mr. James, or whatever you call yourself, _do_ give me the ring.\"\r\nFor on That's finger the fatal ring showed plain.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" said That firmly. \"You appear to be a very grasping\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are you going to _do_?\" Gerald asked in the flat tones of\r\ncomplete hopelessness.\r\n\r\n\"Your interest is very flattering,\" said That. \"Will you tell me, or\r\nwon't you, the way to the nearest railway-station?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Gerald, \"we won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said That, still politely, though quite plainly furious,\r\n\"perhaps you'll tell me the way to the nearest lunatic asylum?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no, no!\" cried Kathleen. \"You're not so bad as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not. But _you_ are,\" That retorted; \"if you're not lunatics\r\nyou're idiots. However, I see a gentleman ahead who is perhaps sane. In\r\nfact, I seem to recognise him.\" A gentleman, indeed, was now to be seen\r\napproaching. It was the elderly Ugly-Wugly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! don't you remember Jerry?\" Kathleen cried, \"and Cathy, your own\r\nCathy Puss Cat? Dear, dear Jimmy, _don't_ be so silly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Little girl,\" said That, looking at her crossly through his spectacles,\r\n\"I am sorry you have not been better brought up.\" And he walked stiffly\r\ntowards the Ugly-Wugly. Two hats were raised, a few words were\r\nexchanged, and two elderly figures walked side by side down the green\r\npine-walk, followed by three miserable children, horrified, bewildered,\r\nalarmed, and, what is really worse than anything, quite at their wits'\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\"He wished to be rich, so of course he is,\" said Gerald; \"he'll have\r\nmoney for tickets and everything.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO HATS WERE RAISED.]\r\n\r\n\"And when the spell breaks--it's sure to break, isn't it?--he'll find\r\nhimself somewhere awful--perhaps in a really good hotel--and not know\r\nhow he got there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder how long the Ugly-Wuglies lasted,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Gerald answered, \"that reminds me. You two _must_ collect the\r\ncoats and things. Hide them, anywhere you like, and we'll carry them\r\nhome to-morrow--if there _is_ any to-morrow,\" he added darkly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't!\" said Kathleen, once more breathing heavily on the verge of\r\ntears: \"you wouldn't think everything _could_ be so awful, and the sun\r\nshining like it does.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Gerald, \"of course I must stick to Jimmy. You two must\r\ngo home to Mademoiselle and tell her Jimmy and I have gone off in the\r\ntrain with a gentleman--say he looked like an uncle. He does--some kinds\r\nof uncle. There'll be a beastly row afterwards, but it's got to be\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"It all seems thick with lies,\" said Kathleen; \"you don't seem to be\r\nable to get a word of truth in edgewise hardly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you worry,\" said her brother; \"they aren't lies--they're as true\r\nas anything else in this magic rot we've got mixed up in. It's like\r\ntelling lies in a dream; you can't help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, all I know is I wish it would stop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lot of use your wishing _that_ is,\" said Gerald, exasperated. \"So long.\r\nI've _got_ to go, and you've _got_ to stay. If it's any comfort to you,\r\nI don't believe _any_ of it's real: it can't be; it's too thick. Tell\r\nMademoiselle Jimmy and I will be back to tea. If we don't happen to be I\r\ncan't help it. I can't help _anything_, except perhaps Jimmy.\" He\r\nstarted to run, for the girls had lagged, and the Ugly-Wugly and That\r\n(late Jimmy) had quickened their pace.\r\n\r\nThe girls were left looking after them.\r\n\r\n\"We've _got_ to find these clothes,\" said Mabel, \"simply got to. I used\r\nto want to be a heroine. It's different when it really comes to being,\r\nisn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very,\" said Kathleen. \"Where shall we hide the clothes when we've\r\ngot them? Not--not that passage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" said Mabel firmly: \"we'll hide them inside the great stone\r\ndinosaurus. He's hollow.\"\r\n\r\n\"He comes alive--in his stone,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Not in the sunshine he doesn't,\" Mabel told her confidently, \"and not\r\nwithout the ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"There won't be any apples and books to-day,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"No, but we'll do the babiest thing we _can_ do the minute we get home.\r\nWe'll have a dolls' tea-party. That'll make us feel as if there wasn't\r\nreally any magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll have to be a very strong tea party, then,\" said Kathleen\r\ndoubtfully.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now we see Gerald, a small but quite determined figure, paddling\r\nalong in the soft white dust of the sunny road, in the wake of two\r\nelderly gentlemen. His hand, in his trousers pocket, buries itself with\r\na feeling of satisfaction in the heavy mixed coinage that is his share\r\nof the profits of his conjuring at the fair. His noiseless tennis-shoes\r\nbear him to the station, where, unobserved, he listens at the ticket\r\noffice to the voice of That-which-was-James. \"One first London,\" it\r\nsays; and Gerald, waiting till That and the Ugly-Wugly have strolled on\r\nto the platform, politely conversing of politics and the Kaffir market,\r\ntakes a third return to London. The train strides in, squeaking and\r\npuffing. The watched take their seats in a carriage blue-lined. The\r\nwatcher springs into a yellow wooden compartment. A whistle sounds, a\r\nflag is waved. The train pulls itself together, strains, jerks, and\r\nstarts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MABEL HANDS UP THE CLOTHES AND THE STICKS.]\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand,\" says Gerald, alone in his third-class carriage,\r\n\"how railway trains and magic _can_ go on at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet they do.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMabel and Kathleen, nervously peering among the rhododendron bushes and\r\nthe bracken and the fancy fir-trees, find six several heaps of coats,\r\nhats, skirts, gloves, golf-clubs, hockey-sticks, broom-handles. They\r\ncarry them, panting and damp, for the mid-day sun is pitiless, up the\r\nhill to where the stone dinosaurus looms immense among a forest of\r\nlarches. The dinosaurus has a hole in his stomach. Kathleen shows Mabel\r\nhow to \"make a back\" and climbs up on it into the cold, stony inside\r\nof the monster. Mabel hands up the clothes and the sticks.\r\n\r\n\"There's lots of room,\" says Kathleen; \"its tail goes down into the\r\nground. It's like a secret passage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose something comes out of it and jumps out at you,\" says Mabel,\r\nand Kathleen hurriedly descends.\r\n\r\nThe explanations to Mademoiselle promise to be difficult, but, as\r\nKathleen said afterwards, any little thing is enough to take a\r\ngrown-up's attention off. A figure passes the window just as they are\r\nexplaining that it really did look exactly like an uncle that the boys\r\nhave gone to London with.\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\" says Mademoiselle suddenly, pointing, too, which every one\r\nknows is not manners.\r\n\r\nIt is the bailiff coming back from the doctor's with antiseptic plaster\r\non that nasty cut that took so long a-bathing this morning. They tell\r\nher it is the bailiff at Yalding Towers, and she says, \"Sky!\" (_Ciel!_)\r\nand asks no more awkward questions about the boys. Lunch--very late--is\r\na silent meal. After lunch Mademoiselle goes out, in a hat with many\r\npink roses, carrying a rose-lined parasol. The girls, in dead silence,\r\norganise a dolls' tea-party, with real tea. At the second cup Kathleen\r\nbursts into tears. Mabel, also weeping, embraces her.\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" sobs Kathleen, \"oh, I _do_ wish I knew where the boys were!\r\nIt _would_ be such a comfort.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGerald knew where the boys were, and it was no comfort to him at all. If\r\nyou come to think of it, he was the only person who could know where\r\nthey were, because Jimmy didn't know that he was a boy--and indeed he\r\nwasn't really--and the Ugly-Wugly couldn't be expected to know anything\r\nreal, such as where boys were. At the moment when the second cup of\r\ndolls' tea--very strong, but not strong enough to drown care in--was\r\nbeing poured out by the trembling hand of Kathleen, Gerald was\r\nlurking--there really is no other word for it--on the staircase of\r\nAldermanbury Buildings, Old Broad Street. On the floor below him was a\r\ndoor bearing the legend \"Mr. U. W. Ugli, Stock and Share Broker. And at\r\nthe Stock Exchange,\" and on the floor above was another door, on which\r\nwas the name of Gerald's little brother, now grown suddenly rich in so\r\nmagic and tragic a way. There were no explaining words under Jimmy's\r\nname. Gerald could not guess what walk in life it was to which That\r\n(which had been Jimmy) owed its affluence. He had seen, when the door\r\nopened to admit his brother, a tangle of clerks and mahogany desks.\r\nEvidently That had a large business.\r\n\r\nWhat was Gerald to do? What _could_ he do?\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible, especially for one so young as Gerald, to enter\r\na large London office and explain that the elderly and respected head\r\nof it is not what he seems, but is really your little brother, who has\r\nbeen suddenly advanced to age and wealth by a tricky wishing ring. If\r\nyou think it's a possible thing, try it, that's all. Nor could he knock\r\nat the door of Mr. U. W. Ugli, Stock and Share Broker (and at the Stock\r\nExchange), and inform _his_ clerks that their chief was really nothing\r\nbut old clothes that had accidentally come alive, and by some magic,\r\nwhich he couldn't attempt to explain, become real during a night spent\r\nat a really good hotel which had no existence.\r\n\r\nThe situation bristled, as you see, with difficulties. And it was so\r\nlong past Gerald's proper dinner-time that his increasing hunger was\r\nrapidly growing to seem the most important difficulty of all. It is\r\nquite possible to starve to death on the staircase of a London building\r\nif the people you are watching for only stay long enough in their\r\noffices. The truth of this came home to Gerald more and more painfully.\r\n\r\nA boy with hair like a new front door mat came whistling up the stairs.\r\nHe had a dark blue bag in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you a tanner for yourself if you'll get me a tanner's worth\r\nof buns,\" said Gerald, with that prompt decision common to all great\r\ncommanders.\r\n\r\n\"Show us yer tanners,\" the boy rejoined with at least equal promptness.\r\nGerald showed them. \"All right; hand over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Payment on delivery,\" said Gerald, using words from the drapers which\r\nhe had never thought to use.\r\n\r\nThe boy grinned admiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Knows 'is wy abaht,\" he said; \"ain't no flies on 'im.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not many,\" Gerald owned with modest pride. \"Cut along, there's a good\r\nchap. I've _got_ to wait here. I'll take care of your bag if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor yet there ain't no flies on me neither,\" remarked the boy,\r\nshouldering it. \"I been up to the confidence trick for years--ever since\r\nI was your age.\"\r\n\r\nWith this parting shot he went, and returned in due course bun-laden.\r\nGerald gave the sixpence and took the buns. When the boy, a minute\r\nlater, emerged from the door of Mr. U. W. Ugli, Stock and Share Broker\r\n(and at the Stock Exchange), Gerald stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"What sort of chap's that?\" he asked, pointing the question with a jerk\r\nof an explaining thumb.\r\n\r\n\"Awful big pot,\" said the boy; \"up to his eyes in oof. Motor and all\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Know anything about the one on the next landing?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's bigger than what this one is. Very old firm--special cellar in the\r\nBank of England to put his chink in--all in bins like against the wall\r\nat the corn-chandler's. Jimminy, I wouldn't mind 'alf an hour in there,\r\nand the doors open and the police away at a beano. Not much! Neither.\r\nYou'll bust if you eat all them buns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have one?\" Gerald responded, and held out the bag.\r\n\r\n\"They say in our office,\" said the boy, paying for the bun honourably\r\nwith unasked information, \"as these two is all for cutting each other's\r\nthroats--oh, only in the way of business--been at it for years.\"\r\n\r\nGerald wildly wondered what magic and how much had been needed to\r\ngive history and a past to these two things of yesterday, the rich\r\nJimmy and the Ugly-Wugly. If he could get them away would all memory\r\nof them fade--in this boy's mind, for instance, in the minds of all\r\nthe people who did business with them in the City? Would the\r\nmahogany-and-clerk-furnished offices fade away? Were the clerks\r\nreal? Was the mahogany? Was he himself real? Was the boy?\r\n\r\n\"Can you keep a secret?\" he asked the other boy. \"Are you on for a\r\nlark?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ought to be getting back to the office,\" said the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Get then!\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you get stuffy,\" said the boy. \"I was just agoing to say it\r\ndidn't matter. I know how to make my nose bleed if I'm a bit late.\"\r\n\r\nGerald congratulated him on this accomplishment, at once so useful and\r\nso graceful, and then said:--\r\n\r\n\"Look here. I'll give you five bob--honest.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" was the boy's natural question.\r\n\r\n\"If you'll help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a private inquiry,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"'Tec? You don't look it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the good of being one if you look it?\" Gerald asked impatiently,\r\nbeginning on another bun. \"That old chap on the floor above--he's\r\n_wanted_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Police?\" asked the boy with fine carelessness.\r\n\r\n\"No--sorrowing relations.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Return to,'\" said the boy; \"'all forgotten and forgiven.' I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I've got to get him to them, somehow. Now, if you could go in and\r\ngive him a message from some one who wanted to meet him on business----\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" said the boy. \"I know a trick worth two of that. You go in\r\nand see old Ugli. He'd give his ears to have the old boy out of the way\r\nfor a day or two. They were saying so in our office only this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me think,\" said Gerald, laying down the last bun on his knee\r\nexpressly to hold his head in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you forget to think about my five bob,\" said the boy.\r\n\r\nThen there was a silence on the stairs, broken only by the cough of a\r\nclerk in That's office, and the clickety-clack of a typewriter in the\r\noffice of Mr. U. W. Ugli.\r\n\r\nThen Gerald rose up and finished the bun.\r\n\r\n\"You're right,\" he said. \"I'll chance it. Here's your five bob.\"\r\n\r\nHe brushed the bun crumbs from his front, cleared his throat, and\r\nknocked at the door of Mr. U. W. Ugli. It opened and he entered.\r\n\r\nThe door-mat boy lingered, secure in his power to account for his long\r\nabsence by means of his well-trained nose, and his waiting was rewarded.\r\nHe went down a few steps, round the bend of the stairs, and heard the\r\nvoice of Mr. U. W. Ugli, so well known on that staircase (and on the\r\nStock Exchange) say in soft, cautious accents:--\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll ask him to let me look at the ring--and I'll drop it. You\r\npick it up. But remember, it's a pure accident, and you don't know me. I\r\ncan't have my name mixed up in a thing like this. You're _sure_ he's\r\nreally unhinged?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite,\" said Gerald; \"he's quite mad about that ring. He'll follow it\r\nanywhere. I know he will. And think of his sorrowing relations.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do--I do,\" said Mr. Ugli kindly; \"that's all I _do_ think of, of\r\ncourse.\"\r\n\r\nHe went up the stairs to the other office, and Gerald heard the voice of\r\nThat telling his clerks that he was going out to lunch. Then the\r\nhorrible Ugly-Wugly and Jimmy, hardly less horrible in the eyes of\r\nGerald, passed down the stairs where, in the dusk of the lower landing,\r\ntwo boys were making themselves as undistinguishable as possible, and so\r\nout into the street, talking of stocks and shares, bears and bulls. The\r\ntwo boys followed.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" the door-mat-headed boy whispered admiringly, \"whatever are you\r\nup to?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll see,\" said Gerald recklessly. \"Come on!\"\r\n\r\n\"You tell me. I must be getting back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you, but you won't believe me. That old gentleman's not\r\nreally old at all--he's my young brother suddenly turned into what you\r\nsee. The other's not real at all. He's only just old clothes and nothing\r\ninside.\"\r\n\r\n\"He looks it, I must say,\" the boy admitted; \"but I say--you do stick it\r\non, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my brother was turned like that by a magic ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"There ain't no such thing as magic,\" said the boy. \"I learnt that at\r\nschool.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Gerald. \"Goodbye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, go ahead!\" said the boy; \"you do stick it on, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that magic ring. If I can get hold of it I shall just wish we\r\nwere all in a certain place. And we shall be. And then I can deal with\r\nboth of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the ring won't _unwish_ anything you've wished. That undoes itself\r\nwith time, like a spring uncoiling. But it'll give you a brand-new\r\nwish--I'm almost certain of it. Anyhow, I'm going to chance it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a rotter, aren't you?\" said the boy respectfully.\r\n\r\n\"You wait and see,\" Gerald repeated.\r\n\r\n\"I say, you aren't going into this swell place! you _can't_?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy paused, appalled at the majesty of Pym's.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am--they can't turn us out as long as we behave. You come along,\r\ntoo. I'll stand lunch.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know why Gerald clung so to this boy. He wasn't a very nice boy.\r\nPerhaps it was because he was the only person Gerald knew in London, to\r\nspeak to--except That-which-had-been-Jimmy and the Ugly-Wugly; and he\r\ndid not want to talk to either of them.\r\n\r\nWhat happened next happened so quickly that, as Gerald said later, it\r\nwas \"just like magic.\" The restaurant was crowded--busy men were hastily\r\nbolting the food hurriedly brought by busy waitresses. There was a clink\r\nof forks and plates, the gurgle of beer from bottles, the hum of talk,\r\nand the smell of many good things to eat.\r\n\r\n\"Two chops, please,\" Gerald had just said, playing with a plainly shown\r\nhandful of money, so as to leave no doubt of his honourable intentions.\r\nThen at the next table he heard the words, \"Ah, yes, curious old family\r\nheirloom,\" the ring was drawn off the finger of That, and Mr. U. W.\r\nUgli, murmuring something about a unique curio, reached his impossible\r\nhand out for it. The door-mat-headed boy was watching breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"There's a ring right enough,\" he owned. And then the ring slipped from\r\nthe hand of Mr. U. W. Ugli and skidded along the floor. Gerald pounced\r\non it like a greyhound on a hare. He thrust the dull circlet on his\r\nfinger and cried out aloud in that crowded place:--\r\n\r\n\"I wish Jimmy and I were inside that door behind the statue of Flora.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the only safe place he could think of.\r\n\r\nThe lights and sounds and scents of the restaurant died away as a\r\nwax-drop dies in fire--a rain-drop in water. I don't know, and Gerald\r\nnever knew, what happened in that restaurant. There was nothing about it\r\nin the papers, though Gerald looked anxiously for \"Extraordinary\r\nDisappearance of well-known City Man.\" What the door-mat-headed boy did\r\nor thought I don't know either. No more does Gerald. But he would like\r\nto know, whereas I don't care tuppence. The world went on all right,\r\nanyhow, whatever he thought or did. The lights and the sounds and the\r\nscents of Pym's died out. In place of the light there was darkness; in\r\nplace of the sounds there was silence; and in place of the scent of\r\nbeef, pork, mutton, fish, veal, cabbage, onions, carrots, beer, and\r\ntobacco there was the musty, damp scent of a place underground that has\r\nbeen long shut up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HE CRIED OUT ALOUD IN THAT CROWDED PLACE: \"I WISH JIMMY\r\nAND I WERE INSIDE THAT DOOR BEHIND THE STATUE OF FLORA.\"]\r\n\r\nGerald felt sick and giddy, and there was something at the back of his\r\nmind that he knew would make him feel sicker and giddier as soon as he\r\nshould have the sense to remember what it was. Meantime it was important\r\nto think of proper words to soothe the City man that had once been\r\nJimmy--to keep him quiet till Time, like a spring uncoiling, should\r\nbring the reversal of the spell--make all things as they were and as\r\nthey ought to be. But he fought in vain for words. There were none. Nor\r\nwere they needed. For through the deep darkness came a voice--and it was\r\nnot the voice of that City man who had been Jimmy, but the voice of that\r\nvery Jimmy who was Gerald's little brother, and who had wished that\r\nunlucky wish for riches that could only be answered by changing all that\r\nwas Jimmy, young and poor, to all that Jimmy, rich and old, would have\r\nbeen. Another voice said: \"Jerry, Jerry! Are you awake?--I've had such a\r\nrum dream.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then there was a moment when nothing was said or done.\r\n\r\nGerald felt through the thick darkness, and the thick silence, and the\r\nthick scent of old earth shut up, and he got hold of Jimmy's hand.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, Jimmy, old chap,\" he said; \"it's not a dream now. It's\r\nthat beastly ring again. I had to wish us here, to get you back at all\r\nout of your dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wish us where?\" Jimmy held on to the hand in a way that in the daylight\r\nof life he would have been the first to call babyish.\r\n\r\n\"Inside the passage--behind the Flora statue,\" said Gerald, adding,\r\n\"it's all right, really.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I daresay it's all right,\" Jimmy answered through the dark, with an\r\nirritation not strong enough to make him loosen his hold of his\r\nbrother's hand. \"_But how are we going to get out?_\"\r\n\r\nThen Gerald knew what it was that was waiting to make him feel more\r\ngiddy than the lightning flight from Cheapside to Yalding Towers had\r\nbeen able to make him. But he said stoutly:\r\n\r\n\"I'll wish us out, of course.\" Though all the time he knew that the ring\r\nwould not undo its given wishes.\r\n\r\nIt didn't.\r\n\r\nGerald wished. He handed the ring carefully to Jimmy, through the thick\r\ndarkness. And Jimmy wished.\r\n\r\nAnd there they still were, in that black passage behind Flora, that had\r\nled--in the case of one Ugly-Wugly at least--to \"a good hotel.\" And the\r\nstone door was shut. And they did not know even which way to turn to it.\r\n\r\n\"If I only had some matches!\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you leave me in the dream?\" Jimmy almost whimpered. \"It was\r\nlight there, and I was just going to have salmon and cucumber.\"\r\n\r\n\"I,\" rejoined Gerald in gloom, \"was just going to have steak and fried\r\npotatoes.\"\r\n\r\nThe silence, and the darkness, and the earthy scent were all they had\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\"I always wondered what it would be like,\" said Jimmy in low, even\r\ntones, \"to be buried alive. And now I know! Oh!\" his voice suddenly rose\r\nto a shriek, \"it isn't true, it isn't! It's a dream--that's what it\r\nis!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause while you could have counted ten. Then--\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Gerald bravely, through the scent and the silence and the\r\ndarkness, \"it's just a dream, Jimmy, old chap. We'll just hold on, and\r\ncall out now and then just for the lark of the thing. But it's really\r\nonly a dream, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Jimmy in the silence and the darkness and the scent of\r\nold earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is a curtain, thin as gossamer, clear as glass, strong as iron,\r\nthat hangs for ever between the world of magic and the world that seems\r\nto us to be real. And when once people have found one of the little weak\r\nspots in that curtain which are marked by magic rings, and amulets, and\r\nthe like, almost anything may happen. Thus it is not surprising that\r\nMabel and Kathleen, conscientiously conducting one of the dullest dolls'\r\ntea-parties at which either had ever assisted, should suddenly, and both\r\nat once, have felt a strange, unreasonable, but quite irresistible\r\ndesire to return instantly to the Temple of Flora--even at the cost of\r\nleaving the dolls' tea-service in an unwashed state, and only half the\r\nraisins eaten. They went--as one has to go when the magic impulse drives\r\none--against their better judgment, against their wills almost.\r\n\r\nAnd the nearer they came to the Temple of Flora, in the golden hush of\r\nthe afternoon, the more certain each was that they could not possibly\r\nhave done otherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd this explains exactly how it was that when Gerald and Jimmy,\r\nholding hands in the darkness of the passage, uttered their first\r\nconcerted yell, \"just for the lark of the thing,\" that yell was\r\ninstantly answered from outside.\r\n\r\nA crack of light showed in that part of the passage where they had least\r\nexpected the door to be. The stone door itself swung slowly open, and\r\nthey were out of it, in the Temple of Flora, blinking in the good\r\ndaylight, an unresisting prey to Kathleen's embraces and the\r\nquestionings of Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"And you left that Ugly-Wugly loose in London,\" Mabel pointed out; \"you\r\nmight have wished it to be with you, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right where it is,\" said Gerald. \"I couldn't think of\r\neverything. And besides, no, thank you! Now we'll go home and seal up\r\nthe ring in an envelope.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ haven't done anything with the ring yet,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't think you'd want to when you see the sort of things it does\r\nwith you,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't do things like that if _I_ was wishing with it,\" Kathleen\r\nprotested.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Mabel, \"let's just put it back in the treasure-room\r\nand have done with it. I oughtn't ever to have taken it away, really.\r\nIt's a sort of stealing. It's quite as bad, really, as Eliza borrowing\r\nit to astonish her gentleman friend with.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind putting it back if you like,\" said Gerald, \"only if any of\r\nus do think of a sensible wish you'll let us have it out again, of\r\ncourse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" Mabel agreed.\r\n\r\nSo they trooped up to the castle, and Mabel once more worked the spring\r\nthat let down the panelling and showed the jewels, and the ring was put\r\nback among the odd dull ornaments that Mabel had once said were magic.\r\n\r\n\"How innocent it looks!\" said Gerald. \"You wouldn't think there was any\r\nmagic about it. It's just like an old silly ring. I wonder if what Mabel\r\nsaid about the other things is true! Suppose we try.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Don't!_\" said Kathleen. \"_I_ think magic things are spiteful. They\r\njust enjoy getting you into tight places.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to try,\" said Mabel, \"only--well, everything's been rather\r\nupsetting, and I've forgotten what I said anything was.\"\r\n\r\nSo had the others. Perhaps that was why, when Gerald said that a bronze\r\nbuckle laid on the foot would have the effect of seven-league boots, it\r\ndidn't; when Jimmy, a little of the City man he had been clinging to him\r\nstill, said that the steel collar would ensure your always having money\r\nin your pockets, his own remained empty; and when Mabel and Kathleen\r\ninvented qualities of the most delightful nature for various rings and\r\nchains and brooches, nothing at all happened.\r\n\r\n\"It's only the ring that's magic,\" said Mabel at last; \"and, I say!\" she\r\nadded, in quite a different voice.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose even the ring isn't!\"\r\n\r\n\"But we know it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't,\" said Mabel. \"I believe it's not to-day at all. I believe it's\r\nthe other day--we've just dreamed all these things. It's the day I made\r\nup that nonsense about the ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't,\" said Gerald; \"you were in your Princess-clothes then.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Princess-clothes?\" said Mabel, opening her dark eyes very wide.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't be silly,\" said Gerald wearily.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not silly,\" said Mabel; \"and I think it's time you went. I'm sure\r\nJimmy wants his tea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do,\" said Jimmy. \"But you had got the Princess-clothes that\r\nday. Come along; let's shut up the shutters and leave the ring in its\r\nlong home.\"\r\n\r\n\"What ring?\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"Don't take any notice of her,\" said Gerald. \"She's only trying to be\r\nfunny.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not,\" said Mabel; \"but I'm inspired like a Python or a\r\nSibylline lady. What ring?\"\r\n\r\n\"The wishing-ring,\" said Kathleen; \"the invisibility ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see _now_,\" said Mabel, her eyes wider than ever, \"the ring's\r\nwhat you _say_ it is? That's how it came to make us invisible--I just\r\nsaid it. Oh, we can't leave it here, if that's what it is. It isn't\r\nstealing, really, when it's as valuable as that, you see. Say what it\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a wishing-ring,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"We've had that before--and you had your silly wish,\" said Mabel, more\r\nand more excited. \"I say it isn't a wishing-ring. I say it's a ring that\r\nmakes the wearer four yards high.\"\r\n\r\nShe had caught up the ring as she spoke, and even as she spoke the ring\r\nshowed high above the children's heads on the finger of an impossible\r\nMabel, who was, indeed, twelve feet high.\r\n\r\n\"Now you've done it!\" said Gerald--and he was right. It was in vain that\r\nMabel asserted that the ring was a wishing-ring. It quite clearly\r\nwasn't; it was what she had said it was.\r\n\r\n\"And you can't tell at all how long the effect will last,\" said Gerald.\r\n\"Look at the invisibleness.\" This is difficult to do, but the others\r\nunderstood him.\r\n\r\n\"It may last for days,\" said Kathleen. \"Oh, Mabel, it _was_ silly of\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, rub it in,\" said Mabel bitterly; \"you should have\r\nbelieved me when I said it was what I said it was. Then I shouldn't have\r\nhad to show you, and I shouldn't be this silly size. What am I to do\r\nnow, I should like to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must conceal you till you get your right size again--that's all,\"\r\nsaid Gerald practically.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--but _where_?\" said Mabel, stamping a foot twenty-four inches long.\r\n\r\n\"In one of the empty rooms. You wouldn't be afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" said Mabel. \"Oh, I do wish we'd just put the ring back\r\nand left it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it wasn't us that didn't,\" said Jimmy, with more truth than\r\ngrammar.\r\n\r\n\"I shall put it back now,\" said Mabel, tugging at it.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't if I were you,\" said Gerald thoughtfully. \"You don't want to\r\nstay that length, do you? And unless the ring's on your finger when the\r\ntime's up, I dare say it wouldn't act.\"\r\n\r\nThe exalted Mabel sullenly touched the spring. The panels slowly slid\r\ninto place, and all the bright jewels were hidden. Once more the room\r\nwas merely eight-sided, panelled, sunlit, and unfurnished.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Mabel, \"where am I to hide? It's a good thing auntie gave me\r\nleave to stay the night with you. As it is, one of you will have to stay\r\nthe night with me. I'm not going to be left alone, the silly height I\r\nam.\"\r\n\r\nHeight was the right word; Mabel had said \"four yards high\"--and she\r\n_was_ four yards high. But she was hardly any thicker than when her\r\nheight was four feet seven, and the effect was, as Gerald remarked,\r\n\"wonderfully worm-like.\" Her clothes had, of course, grown with her, and\r\nshe looked like a little girl reflected in one of those long bent\r\nmirrors at Rosherville Gardens, that make stout people look so happily\r\nslender, and slender people so sadly scraggy. She sat down suddenly on\r\nthe floor, and it was like a four-fold foot-rule folding itself up.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use sitting there, girl,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHE SAT DOWN SUDDENLY ON THE FLOOR, AND IT WAS LIKE A\r\nFOUR-FOLD FOOT-RULE FOLDING ITSELF UP.]\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sitting here,\" retorted Mabel; \"I only got down so as to be\r\nable to get through the door. It'll have to be hands and knees through\r\nmost places for me now, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you hungry?\" Jimmy asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Mabel desolately; \"it's--it's such a long way off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll scout,\" said Gerald; \"if the coast's clear----\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Mabel, \"I think I'd rather be out of doors till it\r\ngets dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"You _can't_. Some one's certain to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if I go through the yew-hedge,\" said Mabel. \"There's a yew-hedge\r\nwith a passage along its inside like the box-hedge in 'The Luck of the\r\nVails.'\"\r\n\r\n\"In _what_?\"\r\n\r\n\"'The Luck of the Vails.' It's a ripping book. It was that book first\r\nset me on to hunt for hidden doors in panels and things. If I crept\r\nalong that on my front, like a serpent--it comes out amongst the\r\nrhododendrons, close by the dinosaurus--we could camp there.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's tea,\" said Gerald, who had had no dinner.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what there isn't,\" said Jimmy, who had had none either.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you _won't_ desert me!\" said Mabel. \"Look here--I'll write to\r\nauntie. She'll give you the things for a picnic, if she's there and\r\nawake. If she isn't, one of the maids will.\"\r\n\r\nSo she wrote on a leaf of Gerald's invaluable pocket-book:--\r\n\r\n          \"DEAREST AUNTIE,--\r\n\r\n          \"Please may we have some things for a picnic?\r\n          Gerald will bring them. I would come myself, but I\r\n          am a little tired. I think I have been growing\r\n          rather fast.--Your loving niece,\r\n\r\n                                           \"MABEL.\"\r\n\r\n          \"P.S.--Lots, please, because some of us are very\r\n          hungry.\"\r\n\r\nIt was found difficult, but possible, for Mabel to creep along the\r\ntunnel in the yew-hedge. Possible, but slow, so that the three had\r\nhardly had time to settle themselves among the rhododendrons and to\r\nwonder bitterly what on earth Gerald was up to, to be such a time gone,\r\nwhen he returned, panting under the weight of a covered basket. He\r\ndumped it down on the fine grass carpet, groaned, and added, \"But it's\r\nworth it. Where's our Mabel?\"\r\n\r\nThe long, pale face of Mabel peered out from rhododendron leaves, very\r\nnear the ground.\r\n\r\n\"I look just like anybody else like this, don't I?\" she asked anxiously;\r\n\"all the rest of me's miles away, under different bushes.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've covered up the bits between the bushes with bracken and leaves,\"\r\nsaid Kathleen, avoiding the question; \"don't wriggle, Mabel, or you'll\r\nwaggle them off.\"\r\n\r\nJimmy was eagerly unpacking the basket. It was a generous tea. A long\r\nloaf, butter in a cabbage-leaf, a bottle of milk, a bottle of water,\r\ncake, and large, smooth, yellow gooseberries in a box that had once held\r\nan extra-sized bottle of somebody's matchless something for the hair\r\nand moustache. Mabel cautiously advanced her incredible arms from the\r\nrhododendron and leaned on one of her spindly elbows, Gerald cut bread\r\nand butter, while Kathleen obligingly ran round, at Mabel's request, to\r\nsee that the green coverings had not dropped from any of the remoter\r\nparts of Mabel's person. Then there was a happy, hungry silence, broken\r\nonly by those brief, impassioned suggestions natural to such an\r\noccasion:--\r\n\r\n\"More cake, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Milk ahoy, there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chuck us the goosegogs.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone grew calmer--more contented with their lot. A pleasant feeling,\r\nhalf tiredness and half restfulness, crept to the extremities of the\r\nparty. Even the unfortunate Mabel was conscious of it in her remote\r\nfeet, that lay crossed under the third rhododendron to the\r\nnorth-north-west of the tea-party. Gerald did but voice the feelings of\r\nthe others when he said, not without regret:--\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm a new man, but I couldn't eat so much as another goosegog if\r\nyou paid me.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ could,\" said Mabel: \"yes, I know they're all gone, and I've had my\r\nshare. But I _could_. It's me being so long, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nA delicious after-food peace filled the summer air. At a little distance\r\nthe green-lichened grey of the vast stone dinosaurus showed through the\r\nshrubs. He, too, seemed peaceful and happy. Gerald caught his stone eye\r\nthrough a gap in the foliage. His glance seemed somehow sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\"I dare say he liked a good meal in his day,\" said Gerald, stretching\r\nluxuriously.\r\n\r\n\"Who did?\"\r\n\r\n\"The dino what's-his-name,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"He had a meal to-day,\" said Kathleen, and giggled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--didn't he?\" said Mabel, giggling also.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't laugh lower than your chest,\" said Kathleen anxiously, \"or\r\nyour green stuff will joggle off.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean--a meal?\" Jimmy asked suspiciously. \"What are you\r\nsniggering about?\"\r\n\r\n\"He had a meal. Things to put in his inside,\" said Kathleen, still\r\ngiggling.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, be funny if you want to,\" said Jimmy, suddenly cross. \"We don't\r\nwant to know--do we, Jerry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Gerald witheringly; \"I'm _dying_ to know. Wake me, you\r\ngirls, when you've finished pretending you're not going to tell.\"\r\n\r\nHe tilted his hat over his eyes, and lay back in the attitude of\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't be stupid!\" said Kathleen hastily. \"It's only that we fed the\r\ndinosaurus through the hole in his stomach with the clothes the\r\nUgly-Wuglies were made of!\"\r\n\r\n\"We can take them home with us, then,\" said Gerald, chewing the white\r\nend of a grass stalk, \"so that's all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Kathleen suddenly; \"I've got an idea. Let me have the\r\nring a bit. I won't say what the idea is, in case it doesn't come off,\r\nand then you'd say I was silly. I'll give it back before we go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but you aren't going yet!\" said Mabel, pleading. She pulled off the\r\nring. \"Of course,\" she added earnestly, \"I'm only too glad for you to\r\ntry any idea, however silly it is.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Kathleen's idea was quite simple. It was only that perhaps the ring\r\nwould change its powers if some one else renamed it--some one who was\r\nnot under the power of its enchantment. So the moment it had passed from\r\nthe long, pale hand of Mabel to one of her own fat, warm, red paws, she\r\njumped up, crying, \"Let's go and empty the dinosaurus _now_,\" and\r\nstarted to run swiftly towards that prehistoric monster. She had a good\r\nstart. She wanted to say aloud, yet so that the others could not hear\r\nher, \"This is a wishing-ring. It gives you any wish you choose.\" And she\r\ndid say it. And no one heard her, except the birds and a squirrel or\r\ntwo, and perhaps a stone faun, whose pretty face seemed to turn a\r\nlaughing look on her as she raced past its pedestal.\r\n\r\nThe way was uphill; it was sunny, and Kathleen had run her hardest,\r\nthough her brothers caught her up before she reached the great black\r\nshadow of the dinosaurus. So that when she did reach that shadow she was\r\nvery hot indeed and not in any state to decide calmly on the best wish\r\nto ask for.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get up and move the things down, because I know exactly where I\r\nput them,\" she said.\r\n\r\nGerald made a back, Jimmy assisted her to climb up, and she disappeared\r\nthrough the hole into the dark inside of the monster. In a moment a\r\nshower began to descend from the opening--a shower of empty waistcoats,\r\ntrousers with wildly waving legs, and coats with sleeves uncontrolled.\r\n\r\n\"Heads below!\" called Kathleen, and down came walking-sticks and\r\ngolf-sticks and hockey-sticks and broom-sticks, rattling and chattering\r\nto each other as they came.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on a bit,\" said Gerald. \"I'm coming up.\" He caught the edge of the\r\nhole above in his hands and jumped. Just as he got his shoulders through\r\nthe opening and his knees on the edge he heard Kathleen's boots on the\r\nfloor of the dinosaurus's inside, and Kathleen's voice saying:\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it jolly cool in here? I suppose statues are always cool. I do\r\nwish I was a statue. Oh!\"\r\n\r\nThe \"oh\" was a cry of horror and anguish. And it seemed to be cut off\r\nvery short by a dreadful stony silence.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" Gerald asked. But in his heart he knew. He climbed up into\r\nthe great hollow. In the little light that came up through the hole he\r\ncould see something white against the grey of the creature's sides. He\r\nfelt in his pockets, still kneeling, struck a match, and when the blue\r\nof its flame changed to clear yellow he looked up to see what he had\r\nknown he would see--the face of Kathleen, white, stony, and lifeless.\r\nHer hair was white, too, and her hands, clothes, shoes--everything was\r\nwhite, with the hard, cold whiteness of marble. Kathleen had her wish:\r\nshe was a statue. There was a long moment of perfect stillness in the\r\ninside of the dinosaurus. Gerald could not speak. It was too sudden, too\r\nterrible. It was worse than anything that had happened yet. Then he\r\nturned and spoke down out of that cold, stony silence to Jimmy, in the\r\ngreen, sunny, rustling, live world outside.\r\n\r\n\"Jimmy,\" he said, in tones perfectly ordinary and matter of fact,\r\n\"Kathleen's gone and said that ring was a wishing-ring. And so it was,\r\nof course. I see now what she was up to, running like that. And then the\r\nyoung duffer went and wished she was a statue.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is she?\" asked Jimmy, below.\r\n\r\n\"Come up and have a look,\" said Gerald. And Jimmy came, partly with a\r\npull from Gerald and partly with a jump of his own.\r\n\r\n\"She's a statue, right enough,\" he said, in awestruck tones. \"Isn't it\r\nawful!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Gerald firmly. \"Come on--let's go and tell Mabel.\"\r\n\r\nTo Mabel, therefore, who had discreetly remained with her long length\r\nscreened by rhododendrons, the two boys returned and broke the news.\r\nThey broke it as one breaks a bottle with a pistol-shot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KATHLEEN HAD HER WISH: SHE WAS A STATUE.]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my goodness!\" said Mabel, and writhed through her long length so\r\nthat the leaves and fern tumbled off in little showers, and she felt the\r\nsun suddenly hot on the backs of her legs. \"What next? Oh, my goodness!\"\r\n\r\n\"She'll come all right,\" said Gerald, with outward calm.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but what about _me_?\" Mabel urged. \"I haven't got the ring. And my\r\ntime will be up before hers is. Couldn't you get it back? Can't you get\r\nit off her hand? I'd put it back on her hand the very minute I was my\r\nright size again--faithfully I would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's nothing to blub about,\" said Jimmy, answering the sniffs\r\nthat had served her in this speech for commas and full-stops; \"not for\r\nyou, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you don't know,\" said Mabel; \"you don't know what it is to be as\r\nlong as I am. Do--do try and get the ring. After all, it is my ring more\r\nthan any of the rest of yours, anyhow, because I did find it, and I did\r\nsay it was magic.\"\r\n\r\nThe sense of justice always present in the breast of Gerald awoke to\r\nthis appeal.\r\n\r\n\"I expect the ring's turned to stone--her boots have, and all her\r\nclothes. But I'll go and see. Only if I can't, I can't, and it's no use\r\nyour making a silly fuss.\"\r\n\r\nThe first match lighted inside the dinosaurus showed the ring dark on\r\nthe white hand of the statuesque Kathleen.\r\n\r\nThe fingers were stretched straight out. Gerald took hold of the ring,\r\nand, to his surprise, it slipped easily off the cold, smooth marble\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Cathy, old girl, I am sorry,\" he said, and gave the marble hand\r\na squeeze. Then it came to him that perhaps she could hear him. So he\r\ntold the statue exactly what he and the others meant to do. This helped\r\nto clear up his ideas as to what he and the others did mean to do. So\r\nthat when, after thumping the statue hearteningly on its marble back, he\r\nreturned to the rhododendrons, he was able to give his orders with the\r\nclear precision of a born leader, as he later said. And since the others\r\nhad, neither of them, thought of any plan, his plan was accepted, as the\r\nplans of born leaders are apt to be.\r\n\r\n\"Here's your precious ring,\" he said to Mabel. \"Now you're not\r\nfrightened of anything, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mabel, in surprise. \"I'd forgotten that. Look here, I'll stay\r\nhere or farther up in the wood if you'll leave me all the coats, so that\r\nI sha'n't be cold in the night. Then I shall be here when Kathleen comes\r\nout of the stone again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Gerald, \"that was exactly the born leader's idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"You two go home and tell Mademoiselle that Kathleen's staying at the\r\nTowers. She is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jimmy, \"she certainly is.\"\r\n\r\n\"The magic goes in seven-hour lots,\" said Gerald; \"your invisibility was\r\ntwenty-one hours, mine fourteen, Eliza's seven. When it was a\r\nwishing-ring it began with seven. But there's no knowing what number it\r\nwill be really. So there's no knowing which of you will come right\r\nfirst. Anyhow, we'll sneak out by the cistern window and come down the\r\ntrellis, after we've said good-night to Mademoiselle, and come and have\r\na look at you before we go to bed. I think you'd better come close up to\r\nthe dinosaurus and we'll leaf you over before we go.\"\r\n\r\nMabel crawled into cover of the taller trees, and there stood up looking\r\nas slender as a poplar and as unreal as the wrong answer to a sum in\r\nlong division. It was to her an easy matter to crouch beneath the\r\ndinosaurus, to put her head up through the opening, and thus to behold\r\nthe white form of Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, dear,\"' she told the stone image; \"I shall be quite\r\nclose to you. You call me as soon as you feel you're coming right\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MABEL LAY DOWN, WAS COVERED UP, AND LEFT.]\r\n\r\nThe statue remained motionless, as statues usually do, and Mabel\r\nwithdrew her head, lay down, was covered up, and left. The boys went\r\nhome. It was the only reasonable thing to do. It would never have done\r\nfor Mademoiselle to become anxious and set the police on their track.\r\nEvery one felt that. The shock of discovering the missing Kathleen, not\r\nonly in a dinosaurus's stomach, but, further, in a stone statue of\r\nherself, might well have unhinged the mind of any constable, to say\r\nnothing of the mind of Mademoiselle, which, being foreign, would\r\nnecessarily be a mind more light and easy to upset. While as for\r\nMabel----\r\n\r\n\"Well, to look at her as she is now,\" said Gerald, \"why, it would send\r\nany one off their chump--except us.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're different,\" said Jimmy; \"our chumps have had to jolly well get\r\nused to things. It would take a lot to upset us now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor old Cathy! all the same,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n= = = = =\r\n\r\nThe sun had died away behind the black trees and the moon was rising.\r\nMabel, her preposterous length covered with coats, waistcoats, and\r\ntrousers laid along it, slept peacefully in the chill of the evening.\r\nInside the dinosaurus Kathleen, alive in her marble, slept too. She had\r\nheard Gerald's words--had seen the lighted matches. She was Kathleen\r\njust the same as ever, only she was Kathleen in a case of marble that\r\nwould not let her move. It would not have let her cry, even if she\r\nwanted to. But she had not wanted to cry. Inside, the marble was not\r\ncold or hard. It seemed, somehow, to be softly lined with warmth and\r\npleasantness and safety. Her back did not ache with stooping. Her limbs\r\nwere not stiff with the hours that they had stayed moveless. Everything\r\nwas well--better than well. One had only to wait quietly and quite\r\ncomfortably and one would come out of this stone case, and once more be\r\nthe Kathleen one had always been used to being. So she waited happily\r\nand calmly, and presently waiting changed to not waiting--to not\r\nanything; and, close held in the soft inwardness of the marble, she\r\nslept as peacefully and calmly as though she had been lying in her own\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nShe was awakened by the fact that she was not lying in her own bed--was\r\nnot, indeed, lying at all--by the fact that she was standing and that\r\nher feet had pins and needles in them. Her arms, too, held out in that\r\nodd way, were stiff and tired. She rubbed her eyes, yawned, and\r\nremembered. She had been a statue, a statue inside the stone dinosaurus.\r\n\r\n\"Now I'm alive again,\" was her instant conclusion, \"and I'll get out of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat down, put her feet through the hole that showed faintly grey in\r\nthe stone beast's underside, and as she did so a long, slow lurch threw\r\nher sideways on the stone where she sat. _The dinosaurus was moving!_\r\n\r\n\"_Oh!_\" said Kathleen inside it, \"how dreadful! It must be moonlight,\r\nand it's come alive, like Gerald said.\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed moving. She could see through the hole the changing\r\nsurface of grass and bracken and moss as it waddled heavily along. She\r\ndared not drop through the hole while it moved, for fear it should crush\r\nher to death with its gigantic feet. And with that thought came another:\r\nwhere was Mabel? Somewhere--somewhere _near_? Suppose one of the great\r\nfeet planted itself on some part of Mabel's inconvenient length? Mabel\r\nbeing the size she was now it would be quite difficult not to step on\r\nsome part or other of her, if she should happen to be in one's\r\nway--quite difficult, however much one tried. And the dinosaurus would\r\nnot try. Why should it? Kathleen hung in an agony over the round\r\nopening. The huge beast swung from side to side. It was going faster; it\r\nwas no good, she dared not jump out. Anyhow, they must be quite away\r\nfrom Mabel by now. Faster and faster went the dinosaurus. The floor of\r\nits stomach sloped. They were going downhill. Twigs cracked and broke as\r\nit pushed through a belt of evergreen oaks; gravel crunched, ground\r\nbeneath its stony feet. Then stone met stone. There was a pause. A\r\nsplash! They were close to water--the lake where by moonlight Hermes\r\nfluttered and Janus and the dinosaurus swam together. Kathleen dropped\r\nswiftly through the hole on to the flat marble that edged the basin,\r\nrushed sideways, and stood panting in the shadow of a statue's pedestal.\r\nNot a moment too soon, for even as she crouched the monster lizard\r\nslipped heavily into the water, drowning a thousand smooth, shining lily\r\npads, and swam away towards the central island.\r\n\r\n\"Be still, little lady. I leap!\" The voice came from the pedestal, and\r\nnext moment Phoebus had jumped from the pedestal in his little temple,\r\nclearing the steps, and landing a couple of yards away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MABEL LAY DOWN, WAS COVERED UP, AND LEFT.]\r\n\r\n\"You are new,\" said Phoebus over his graceful shoulder. \"I should\r\nnot have forgotten you if once I had seen you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" said Kathleen, \"quite, quite new. And I didn't know you could\r\ntalk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" Phoebus laughed. \"You can talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am not I?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I suppose so,\" said Kathleen, distracted, but not afraid;\r\n\"only I thought you had to have the ring on before one could even see\r\nyou move.\"\r\n\r\nPhoebus seemed to understand her, which was rather to his credit, for\r\nshe had certainly not expressed herself with clearness.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that's for mortals,\" he said. \"_We_ can hear and see each other in\r\nthe few moments when life is ours. That is a part of the beautiful\r\nenchantment.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am a mortal,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"You are as modest as you are charming,\" said Phoebus Apollo absently;\r\n\"the white water calls me! I go,\" and the next moment rings of liquid\r\nsilver spread across the lake, widening and widening, from the spot\r\nwhere the white joined hands of the Sun-god had struck the water as he\r\ndived.\r\n\r\nKathleen turned and went up the hill towards the rhododendron bushes.\r\nShe must find Mabel, and they must go home at once. If only Mabel was of\r\na size that one could conveniently take home with one! Most likely, at\r\nthis hour of enchantments, she was. Kathleen, heartened by the thought,\r\nhurried on. She passed through the rhododendron bushes, remembered the\r\npointed painted paper face that had looked out from the glossy leaves,\r\nexpected to be frightened--and wasn't. She found Mabel easily enough,\r\nand much more easily than she would have done had Mabel been as she\r\nwished to find her. For quite a long way off, in the moonlight, she\r\ncould see that long and worm-like form, extended to its full twelve\r\nfeet--and covered with coats and trousers and waistcoats. Mabel looked\r\nlike a drain-pipe that has been covered in sacks in frosty weather.\r\nKathleen touched her long cheek gently, and she woke.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" she said sleepily.\r\n\r\n\"It's only me,\" Kathleen explained.\r\n\r\n\"How cold your hands are!\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"Wake up,\" said Kathleen, \"and let's talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we go home now? I'm awfully tired, and it's so long since\r\ntea-time.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You're_ too long to go home yet,\" said Kathleen sadly, and then Mabel\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nShe lay with closed eyes--then suddenly she stirred and cried out:--\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Cathy, I feel so funny--like one of those horn snakes when you make\r\nit go short to get it into its box. I am--yes--I know I am----\"\r\n\r\nShe was; and Kathleen, watching her, agreed that it was exactly like the\r\nshortening of a horn spiral snake between the closing hands of a child.\r\nMabel's distant feet drew near--Mabel's long, lean arms grew\r\nshorter--Mabel's face was no longer half a yard long.\r\n\r\n\"You're coming right--you are! Oh, I am so glad!\" cried Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"I know _I_ am,\" said Mabel; and as she said it she became once more\r\nMabel, not only in herself, which, of course, she had been all the time,\r\nbut in her outward appearance.\r\n\r\n\"You are all right. Oh, hooray! hooray! I _am_ so glad!\" said Kathleen\r\nkindly; \"and now we'll go home at once, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go home?\" said Mabel, slowly sitting up and staring at Kathleen with\r\nher big dark eyes. \"Go home--like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like what?\" Kathleen asked impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Why, _you_,\" was Mabel's odd reply.\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right,\" said Kathleen. \"Come on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say you don't know?\" said Mabel. \"Look at yourself--your\r\nhands--your dress--everything.\"\r\n\r\nKathleen looked at her hands. They were of marble whiteness. Her dress,\r\ntoo--her shoes, her stockings, even the ends of her hair. She was white\r\nas new-fallen snow.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" she asked, beginning to tremble. \"What am I all this\r\nhorrid colour for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see? Oh, Cathy, don't you see? You've _not_ come right.\r\nYou're a statue still.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not--I'm alive--I'm talking to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you are, darling,\" said Mabel, soothing her as one soothes a\r\nfractious child. \"That's because it's moonlight.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can see I'm alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I can. I've got the ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm all right; I _know_ I am.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WHAT IS IT?\" SHE ASKED, BEGINNING TO TREMBLE. \"WHAT AM I\r\nALL THIS HORRID COLOUR FOR?\"]\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see,\" said Mabel gently, taking her white marble hand,\r\n\"you're not all right? It's moonlight, and you're a statue, and you've\r\njust come alive with all the other statues. And when the moon goes down\r\nyou'll just be a statue again. _That's_ the difficulty, dear, about our\r\ngoing home again. You're just a statue still, only you've come alive\r\nwith the other marble things. Where's the dinosaurus?\"\r\n\r\n\"In his bath,\" said Kathleen, \"and so are all the other stone beasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mabel, trying to look on the bright side of things, \"then\r\nwe've got one thing, at any rate, to be thankful for!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\n\"IF,\" said Kathleen, sitting disconsolate in her marble, \"if I am really\r\na statue come alive, I wonder you're not afraid of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got the ring,\" said Mabel with decision. \"Cheer up, dear! you will\r\nsoon be better. Try not to think about it.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke as you speak to a child that has cut its finger, or fallen\r\ndown on the garden path, and rises up with grazed knees to which gravel\r\nsticks intimately.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" Kathleen absently answered.\r\n\r\n\"And I've been thinking,\" said Mabel brightly, \"we might find out a lot\r\nabout this magic place, if the other statues aren't too proud to talk to\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"They aren't,\" Kathleen assured her; \"at least, Phoebus wasn't, he was\r\nmost awfully polite and nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\" Mabel asked.\r\n\r\n\"In the lake--he was,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Then let's go down there,\" said Mabel. \"Oh, Cathy! it is jolly being\r\nyour own proper thickness again.\" She jumped up, and the withered ferns\r\nand branches that had covered her long length and had been gathered\r\nclosely upon her as she shrank to her proper size fell as forest leaves\r\ndo when sudden storms tear them. But the white Kathleen did not move.\r\n\r\nThe two sat on the grey moonlit grass with the quiet of the night all\r\nabout them. The great park was still as a painted picture; only the\r\nsplash of the fountains and the far-off whistle of the Western express\r\nbroke the silence, which, at the same time, they deepened.\r\n\r\n\"What cheer, little sister!\" said a voice behind them--a golden voice.\r\nThey turned quick, startled heads, as birds, surprised, might turn.\r\nThere in the moonlight stood Phoebus, dripping still from the lake,\r\nand smiling at them, very gentle, very friendly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's you!\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"None other,\" said Phoebus cheerfully. \"Who is your friend, the\r\nearth-child?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is Mabel,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\nMabel got up and bowed, hesitated, and held out a hand.\r\n\r\n\"I am your slave, little lady,\" said Phoebus, enclosing it in marble\r\nfingers. \"But I fail to understand how you can see us, and why you do\r\nnot fear.\"\r\n\r\nMabel held up the hand that wore the ring.\r\n\r\n\"Quite sufficient explanation,\" said Phoebus; \"but since you have\r\nthat, why retain your mottled earthy appearance? Become a statue, and\r\nswim with us in the lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't swim,\" said Mabel evasively.\r\n\r\n\"Nor yet me,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"_You_ can,\" said Phoebus. \"All statues that come to life are\r\nproficient in all athletic exercises. And you, child of the dark eyes\r\nand hair like night, wish yourself a statue and join our revels.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather not, if you will excuse me,\" said Mabel cautiously. \"You see\r\n... this ring ... you wish for things, and you never know how long\r\nthey're going to last. It would be jolly and all that to be a statue\r\n_now_, but in the morning I should wish I hadn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Earth-folk often do, they say,\" mused Phoebus. \"But, child, you seem\r\nignorant of the powers of your ring. Wish exactly, and the ring will\r\nexactly perform. If you give no limit of time, strange enchantments\r\nwoven by Arithmos the outcast god of numbers will creep in and spoil the\r\nspell. Say thus: 'I wish that till the dawn I may be a statue of living\r\nmarble, even as my child friend, and that after that time I may be as\r\nbefore, Mabel of the dark eyes and night-coloured hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, do, it would be so jolly!\" cried Kathleen. \"Do, Mabel! And if\r\nwe're both statues, shall we be afraid of the dinosaurus?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the world of living marble fear is not,\" said Phoebus. \"Are we not\r\nbrothers, we and the dinosaurus, brethren alike wrought of stone and\r\nlife?\"\r\n\r\n\"And could I swim if I did?\"\r\n\r\n\"Swim, and float, and dive--and with the ladies of Olympus spread the\r\nnightly feast, eat of the food of the gods, drink their cup, listen to\r\nthe song that is undying, and catch the laughter of immortal lips.\"\r\n\r\n\"A feast!\" said Kathleen. \"Oh, Mabel, do! You would if you were as\r\nhungry as I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it won't be real food,\" urged Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"It will be real to you, as to us,\" said Phoebus; \"there is no other\r\nrealness even in your many-coloured world.\"\r\n\r\nStill Mabel hesitated. Then she looked at Kathleen's legs and suddenly\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I will. But first I'll take off my shoes and stockings.\r\nMarble boots look simply awful--especially the laces. And a marble,\r\nstocking that's coming down--and mine _do_!\"\r\n\r\nShe had pulled off shoes and stockings and pinafore.\r\n\r\n\"Mabel has the sense of beauty,\" said Phoebus approvingly. \"Speak the\r\nspell, child, and I will lead you to the ladies of Olympus.\"\r\n\r\nMabel, trembling a little, spoke it, and there were two little live\r\nstatues in the moonlit glade. Tall Phoebus took a hand of each.\r\n\r\n\"Come--run!\" he cried. And they ran.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--it is jolly!\" Mabel panted. \"Look at my white feet in the grass! I\r\nthought it would feel stiff to be a statue, but it doesn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no stiffness about the immortals,\" laughed the Sun-god. \"For\r\nto-night you are one of us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that they ran down the slope to the lake.\r\n\r\n\"Jump!\" he cried, and they jumped, and the water splashed up round\r\nthree white, gleaming shapes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I _can_ swim!\" breathed Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"So can I,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you can,\" said Phoebus. \"Now three times round the lake,\r\nand then make for the island.\"\r\n\r\nSide by side the three swam, Phoebus swimming gently to keep pace with\r\nthe children. Their marble clothes did not seem to interfere at all with\r\ntheir swimming, as your clothes would if you suddenly jumped into the\r\nbasin of the Trafalgar Square fountains and tried to swim there. And\r\nthey swam most beautifully, with that perfect ease and absence of effort\r\nor tiredness which you must have noticed about your own swimming--in\r\ndreams. And it was the most lovely place to swim in; the water-lilies,\r\nwhose long, snaky stalks are so inconvenient to ordinary swimmers, did\r\nnot in the least interfere with the movements of marble arms and legs.\r\nThe moon was high in the clear sky-dome. The weeping willows, cypresses,\r\ntemples, terraces, banks of trees and shrubs, and the wonderful old\r\nhouse, all added to the romantic charm of the scene.\r\n\r\n\"This is the nicest thing the ring has brought us yet,\" said Mabel,\r\nthrough a languid but perfect side-stroke.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you'd enjoy it,\" said Phoebus kindly; \"now once more round,\r\nand then the island.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE BY SIDE THE THREE SWAM.]\r\n\r\nThey landed on the island amid a fringe of rushes, yarrow,\r\nwillow-herb, loose-strife, and a few late, scented, powdery, creamy\r\nheads of meadow-sweet. The island was bigger than it looked from the\r\nbank, and it seemed covered with trees and shrubs. But when, Phoebus\r\nleading the way, they went into the shadow of these, they perceived that\r\nbeyond the trees lay a light, much nearer to them than the other side of\r\nthe island could possibly be. And almost at once they were through the\r\nbelt of trees, and could see where the light came from. The trees they\r\nhad just passed among made a dark circle round a big cleared space,\r\nstanding up thick and dark, like a crowd round a football field, as\r\nKathleen remarked.\r\n\r\nFirst came a wide, smooth ring of lawn, then marble steps going down to\r\na round pool, where there were no water-lilies, only gold and silver\r\nfish that darted here and there like flashes of quicksilver and dark\r\nflames. And the enclosed space of water and marble and grass was lighted\r\nwith a clear, white, radiant light, seven times stronger than the\r\nwhitest moonlight, and in the still waters of the pool seven moons lay\r\nreflected. One could see that they were only reflections by the way\r\ntheir shape broke and changed as the gold and silver fish rippled the\r\nwater with moving fin and tail that steered.\r\n\r\nThe girls looked up at the sky, almost expecting to see seven moons\r\nthere. But no, the old moon shone alone, as she had always shone on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"There are seven moons,\" said Mabel blankly, and pointed, which is not\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Phoebus kindly; \"everything in our world is seven\r\ntimes as much so as in yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there aren't seven of you,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"No, but I am seven times as much,\" said the Sun God. \"You see, there's\r\nnumbers, and there's quantity, to say nothing of quality. You see that,\r\nI'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"Explanations always weary me,\" Phoebus interrupted. \"Shall we join\r\nthe ladies?\"\r\n\r\nOn the further side of the pool was a large group, so white, that it\r\nseemed to make a great white hole in the trees. Some twenty or thirty\r\nfigures there were in the group--all statues and all alive. Some were\r\ndipping their white feet among the gold and silver fish, and sending\r\nripples across the faces of the seven moons. Some were pelting each\r\nother with roses--roses so sweet that the girls could smell them even\r\nacross the pool. Others were holding hands and dancing in a ring, and\r\ntwo were sitting on the steps playing cat's-cradle--which is a very\r\nancient game indeed--with a thread of white marble.\r\n\r\nAs the new-comers advanced a shout of greeting and gay laughter went up.\r\n\r\n\"Late again, Phoebus!\" some one called out. And another: \"Did one of\r\nyour horses cast a shoe?\" And yet another called out something about\r\nlaurels.\r\n\r\n\"I bring two guests,\" said Phoebus, and instantly the statues crowded\r\nround, stroking the girls' hair, patting their cheeks, and calling them\r\nthe prettiest love-names.\r\n\r\n\"Are the wreaths ready, Hebe?\" the tallest and most splendid of the\r\nladies called out. \"Make two more!\"\r\n\r\nAnd almost directly Hebe came down the steps, her round arms hung thick\r\nwith rose-wreaths. There was one for each marble head.\r\n\r\nEvery one now looked seven times more beautiful than before, which, in\r\nthe case of the gods and goddesses, is saying a good deal. The children\r\nremembered how at the raspberry vinegar feast Mademoiselle had said that\r\ngods and goddesses always wore wreaths for meals.\r\n\r\nHebe herself arranged the roses on the girls' heads--and Aphrodite\r\nUrania, the dearest lady in the world, with a voice like mother's at\r\nthose moments when you love her most, took them by the hands and said:--\r\n\r\n\"Come, we must get the feast ready. Eros--Psyche--Hebe--Ganymede--all\r\nyou young people can arrange the fruit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see any fruit,\" said Kathleen, as four slender forms disengaged\r\nthemselves from the white crowd and came toward them.\r\n\r\n\"You will though,\" said Eros, a really nice boy, as the girls instantly\r\nagreed; \"you've only got to pick it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like this,\" said Psyche, lifting her marble arms to a willow branch.\r\nShe reached out her hand to the children--it held a ripe pomegranate.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Mabel. \"You just----\" She laid her fingers to the willow\r\nbranch and the firm softness of a big peach was within them.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, just that,\" laughed Psyche, who was a darling, as any one could\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nAfter this Hebe gathered a few silver baskets from a convenient alder,\r\nand the four picked fruit industriously. Meanwhile the elder statues\r\nwere busy plucking golden goblets and jugs and dishes from the branches\r\nof ash-trees and young oaks and filling them with everything nice to eat\r\nand drink that any one could possibly want, and these were spread on the\r\nsteps. It was a celestial picnic. Then everyone sat or lay down and the\r\nfeast began. And oh! the taste of the food served on those dishes, the\r\nsweet wonder of the drink that melted from those gold cups on the white\r\nlips of the company! And the fruit--there is no fruit like it grown on\r\nearth, just as there is no laughter like the laughter of those lips, no\r\nsongs like the songs that stirred the silence of that night of wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried Kathleen, and through her fingers the juice of her third\r\npeach fell like tears on the marble steps. \"I do wish the boys were\r\nhere!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do wonder what they're doing,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IT WAS A CELESTIAL PICNIC.]\r\n\r\n\"At this moment,\" said Hermes, who had just made a wide ring of flight,\r\nas a pigeon does, and come back into the circle--\"at this moment they\r\nare wandering desolately near the home of the dinosaurus, having escaped\r\nfrom their home by a window, in search of you. They fear that you have\r\nperished, and they would weep if they did not know that tears do not\r\nbecome a man, however youthful.\"\r\n\r\nKathleen stood up and brushed the crumbs of ambrosia from her marble\r\nlap.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you all very much,\" she said. \"It was very kind of you to have\r\nus, and we've enjoyed ourselves very much, but I think we ought to go\r\nnow, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it is anxiety about your brothers,\" said Phoebus obligingly, \"it\r\nis the easiest thing in the world for them to join you. Lend me your\r\nring a moment.\"\r\n\r\nHe took it from Kathleen's half-reluctant hand, dipped it in the\r\nreflection of one of the seven moons, and gave it back. She clutched it.\r\n\"Now,\" said the Sun-god, \"wish for them that which Mabel wished for\r\nherself. Say----\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" Kathleen interrupted. \"I wish that the boys may be statues of\r\nliving marble like Mabel and me till dawn, and afterwards be like they\r\nare now.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you hadn't interrupted,\" said Phoebus--\"but there, we can't expect\r\nold heads on shoulders of young marble. You should have wished them\r\n_here_--and--but no matter. Hermes, old chap, cut across and fetch them,\r\nand explain things as you come.\"\r\n\r\nHe dipped the ring again in one of the reflected moons before he gave\r\nit back to Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" he said, \"now it's washed clean ready for the next magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not our custom to question guests,\" said Hera the queen, turning\r\nher great eyes on the children; \"but that ring excites, I am sure, the\r\ninterest of us all.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is _the_ ring,\" said Phoebus.\r\n\r\n\"That, of course,\" said Hera; \"but if it were not inhospitable to ask\r\nquestions I should ask, How came it into the hands of these\r\nearth-children?\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Phoebus, \"is a long tale. After the feast the story, and\r\nafter the story the song.\"\r\n\r\nHermes seemed to have \"explained everything\" quite fully; for when\r\nGerald and Jimmy in marble whiteness arrived, each clinging to one of\r\nthe god's winged feet, and so borne through the air, they were certainly\r\nquite at ease. They made their best bows to the goddesses and took their\r\nplaces as unembarrassed as though they had had Olympian suppers every\r\nnight of their lives. Hebe had woven wreaths of roses ready for them,\r\nand as Kathleen watched them eating and drinking, perfectly at home in\r\ntheir marble, she was very glad that amid the welling springs of\r\nimmortal peach-juice she had not forgotten her brothers.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Hera, when the boys had been supplied with everything\r\nthey could possibly desire, and more than they could eat--\"now for the\r\nstory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mabel intensely; and Kathleen said, \"Oh _yes_; now for the\r\nstory. How splendid!\"\r\n\r\n\"The story,\" said Phoebus unexpectedly, \"will be told by our guests.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh _no_!\" said Kathleen, shrinking.\r\n\r\n\"The lads, maybe, are bolder,\" said Zeus the king, taking off his\r\nrose-wreath, which was a little tight, and rubbing his compressed ears.\r\n\r\n\"I really can't,\" said Gerald; \"besides, I don't know any stories.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor yet me,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"It's the story of how we got the ring that they want,\" said Mabel in a\r\nhurry. \"I'll tell it if you like. Once upon a time there was a little\r\ngirl called Mabel,\" she added yet more hastily, and went on with the\r\ntale--all the tale of the enchanted castle, or almost all, that you have\r\nread in these pages. The marble Olympians listened enchanted--almost as\r\nenchanted as the castle itself, and the soft moonlit moments fell past\r\nlike pearls dropping into a deep pool.\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" Mabel ended abruptly, \"Kathleen wished for the boys and the\r\nLord Hermes fetched them and here we all are.\"\r\n\r\nA burst of interested comment and question blossomed out round the end\r\nof the story, suddenly broken off short by Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said she, brushing it aside, as it grew thinner, \"now we want\r\n_you_ to tell _us_.\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell you----?\"\r\n\r\n\"How you come to be alive, and how you know about the ring--and\r\neverything you _do_ know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything I know?\" Phoebus laughed--it was to him that she had\r\nspoken--and not his lips only but all the white lips curled in laughter.\r\n\"The span of your life, my earth-child, would not contain the words I\r\nshould speak, to tell you all I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, about the ring anyhow, and how you come alive,\" said Gerald; \"you\r\nsee, it's very puzzling to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell them, Phoebus,\" said the dearest lady in the world; \"don't tease\r\nthe children.\"\r\n\r\nSo Phoebus, leaning back against a heap of leopard-skins that Dionysus\r\nhad lavishly plucked from a spruce fir, told.\r\n\r\n\"All statues,\" he said, \"can come alive when the moon shines, if they so\r\nchoose. But statues that are placed in ugly cities do not choose. Why\r\nshould they weary themselves with the contemplation of the hideous?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" said Gerald politely, to fill the pause.\r\n\r\n\"In your beautiful temples,\" the Sun-god went on, \"the images of your\r\npriests and of your warriors who lie cross-legged on their tombs come\r\nalive and walk in their marble about their temples, and through the\r\nwoods and fields. But only on one night in all the year can any see\r\nthem. You have beheld us because you held the ring, and are of one\r\nbrotherhood with us in your marble, but on that one night all may behold\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when is that?\" Gerald asked, again polite, in a pause.\r\n\r\n\"At the festival of the harvest,\" said Phoebus. \"On that night as the\r\nmoon rises it strikes one beam of perfect light on to the altar in\r\ncertain temples. One of these temples is in Hellas, buried under the\r\nfall of a mountain which Zeus, being angry, hurled down upon it. One is\r\nin this land; it is in this great garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Gerald, much interested, \"if we were to come up to that\r\ntemple on that night, we could see you, even without being statues or\r\nhaving the ring?\"\r\n\r\n\"Even so,\" said Phoebus. \"More, any question asked by a mortal we are\r\non that night bound to answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the night is--when?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Phoebus, and laughed. \"Wouldn't you like to know!\"\r\n\r\nThen the great marble King of the Gods yawned, stroked his long beard,\r\nand said: \"Enough of stories, Phoebus. Tune your lyre.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the ring,\" said Mabel in a whisper, as the Sun-god tuned the white\r\nstrings of a sort of marble harp that lay at his feet--\"about how you\r\nknow all about the ring?\"\r\n\r\n\"Presently,\" the Sun-god whispered back. \"Zeus must be obeyed; but ask\r\nme again before dawn, and I will tell you all I know of it.\" Mabel drew\r\nback, and leaned against the comfortable knees of one Demeter--Kathleen\r\nand Psyche sat holding hands. Gerald and Jimmy lay at full length, chins\r\non elbows, gazing at the Sun-god; and even as he held the lyre, before\r\never his fingers began to sweep the strings, the spirit of music hung in\r\nthe air, enchanting, enslaving, silencing all thought but the thought of\r\nitself, all desire but the desire to listen to it.\r\n\r\nThen Phoebus struck the strings and softly plucked melody from them,\r\nand all the beautiful dreams of all the world came fluttering close with\r\nwings like doves' wings; and all the lovely thoughts that sometimes\r\nhover near, but not so near that you can catch them, now came home as to\r\ntheir nests in the hearts of those who listened. And those who listened\r\nforgot time and space, and how to be sad, and how to be naughty, and it\r\nseemed that the whole world lay like a magic apple in the hand of each\r\nlistener, and that the whole world was good and beautiful.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, the spell was shattered. Phoebus struck a broken\r\nchord, followed by an instant of silence; then he sprang up, crying,\r\n\"The dawn! the dawn! To your pedestals, O gods!\"\r\n\r\nIn an instant the whole crowd of beautiful marble people had leaped to\r\nits feet, had rushed through the belt of wood that cracked and rustled\r\nas they went, and the children heard them splash in the water beyond.\r\nThey heard, too, the gurgling breathing of a great beast, and knew that\r\nthe dinosaurus, too, was returning to his own place.\r\n\r\nOnly Hermes had time, since one flies more swiftly than one swims, to\r\nhover above them for one moment, and to whisper with a mischievous\r\nlaugh:--\r\n\r\n\"In fourteen days from now, at the Temple of Strange Stones.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the secret of the ring?\" gasped Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"The ring is the heart of the magic,\" said Hermes. \"Ask at the moonrise\r\non the fourteenth day, and you shall know all.\"\r\n\r\nWith that he waved the snowy caduceus and rose in the air supported by\r\nhis winged feet. And as he went the seven reflected moons died out and a\r\nchill wind began to blow, a grey light grew and grew, the birds stirred\r\nand twittered, and the marble slipped away from the children like a skin\r\nthat shrivels in fire, and they were statues no more, but flesh and\r\nblood children as they used to be, standing knee-deep in brambles and\r\nlong coarse grass. There was no smooth lawn, no marble steps, no\r\nseven-mooned fish-pond. The dew lay thick on the grass and the brambles,\r\nand it was very cold.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to have gone with them,\" said Mabel with chattering teeth. \"We\r\ncan't swim now we're not marble. And I suppose this _is_ the island?\"\r\n\r\nIt was--and they couldn't swim.\r\n\r\nThey knew it. One always knows those sort of things somehow without\r\ntrying. For instance, you know perfectly that you can't fly. There are\r\nsome things that there is no mistake about.\r\n\r\nThe dawn grew brighter and the outlook more black every moment.\r\n\r\n\"There isn't a boat, I suppose?\" Jimmy asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mabel, \"not on this side of the lake; there's one in the\r\nboat-house, of course--if you could swim there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know I can't,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"Can't any one think of anything?\" Gerald asked, shivering.\r\n\r\n\"When they find we've disappeared they'll drag all the water for miles\r\nround,\" said Jimmy hopefully, \"in case we've fallen in and sunk to the\r\nbottom. When they come to drag this we can yell and be rescued.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear, that _will_ be nice,\" was Gerald's bitter comment.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be so disagreeable,\" said Mabel with a tone so strangely cheerful\r\nthat the rest stared at her in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"The ring,\" she said. \"Of course we've only got to wish ourselves home\r\nwith it. Phoebus washed it in the moon ready for the next wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't tell us about that,\" said Gerald in accents of perfect good\r\ntemper. \"Never mind. Where _is_ the ring?\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ had it,\" Mabel reminded Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"I know I had,\" said that child in stricken tones, \"but I gave it to\r\nPsyche to look at--and--and she's got it on her finger!\"\r\n\r\nEvery one tried not to be angry with Kathleen. All partly succeeded.\r\n\r\n\"If we ever get off this beastly island,\" said Gerald, \"I suppose you\r\ncan find Psyche's statue and get it off again?\"\r\n\r\n\"No I can't,\" Mabel moaned. \"I don't know where the statue is. I've\r\nnever seen it. It may be in Hellas, wherever that is--or anywhere, for\r\nanything _I_ know.\"\r\n\r\nNo one had anything kind to say, and it is pleasant to record that\r\nnobody said anything. And now it was grey daylight, and the sky to the\r\nnorth was flushing in pale pink and lavender.\r\n\r\nThe boys stood moodily, hands in pockets. Mabel and Kathleen seemed to\r\nfind it impossible not to cling together, and all about their legs the\r\nlong grass was icy with dew.\r\n\r\nA faint sniff and a caught breath broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"Now, look here,\" said Gerald briskly, \"I won't have it. Do you hear?\r\nSnivelling's no good at all. No, I'm not a pig. It's for your own good.\r\nLets make a tour of the island. Perhaps there's a boat hidden somewhere\r\namong the overhanging boughs.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could there be?\" Mabel asked.\r\n\r\n\"Some one might have left it there, I suppose,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"But how would they have got off the island?\"\r\n\r\n\"In another boat, of course,\" said Gerald; \"come on.\"\r\n\r\nDownheartedly, and quite sure that there wasn't and couldn't be any\r\nboat, the four children started to explore the island. How often each\r\none of them had dreamed of islands, how often wished to be stranded on\r\none! Well, now they were. Reality is sometimes quite different from\r\ndreams, and not half so nice. It was worst of all for Mabel, whose shoes\r\nand stockings were far away on the mainland. The coarse grass and\r\nbrambles were very cruel to bare legs and feet.\r\n\r\nThey stumbled through the wood to the edge of the water, but it was\r\nimpossible to keep close to the edge of the island, the branches grew\r\ntoo thickly. There was a narrow, grassy path that wound in and out among\r\nthe trees, and this they followed, dejected and mournful. Every moment\r\nmade it less possible for them to hope to get back to the school-house\r\nunnoticed. And if they were missed and beds found in their present\r\nunslept-in state--well, there would be a row of some sort, and, as\r\nGerald said, \"Farewell to liberty!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we can get off all right,\" said Gerald. \"Just all shout when\r\nwe see a gardener or a keeper on the mainland. But if we do, concealment\r\nis at an end and all is absolutely up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said everyone gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"Come, buck up!\" said Gerald, the spirit of the born general beginning\r\nto reawaken in him. \"We shall get out of this scrape all right, as we've\r\ngot out of others; you know we shall. See, the sun's coming out. You\r\nfeel all right and jolly now, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, oh yes!\" said everyone, in tones of unmixed misery.\r\n\r\nThe sun was now risen, and through a deep cleft in the hills it sent a\r\nstrong shaft of light straight at the island. The yellow light, almost\r\nlevel, struck through the stems of the trees and dazzled the children's\r\neyes. This, with the fact that he was not looking where he was going, as\r\nJimmy did not fail to point out later, was enough to account for what\r\nnow happened to Gerald, who was leading the melancholy little\r\nprocession. He stumbled, clutched at a tree-trunk, missed his clutch,\r\nand disappeared, with a yell and a clatter; and Mabel, who came next,\r\nonly pulled herself up just in time not to fall down a steep flight of\r\nmoss-grown steps that seemed to open suddenly in the ground at her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Gerald!\" she called down the steps: \"are you hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Gerald, out of sight and crossly, for he _was_ hurt, rather\r\nseverely; \"it's steps, and there's a passage.\"\r\n\r\n\"There always is,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"I knew there was a passage,\" said Mabel; \"it goes under the water and\r\ncomes out at the Temple of Flora. Even the gardeners know that, but they\r\nwon't go down, for fear of snakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we can get out that way--I do think you might have said so,\"\r\nGerald's voice came up to say.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think of it,\" said Mabel. \"At least---- And I suppose it goes\r\npast the place where the Ugly-Wugly found its good hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going,\" said Kathleen positively, \"not in the dark, I'm not. So\r\nI tell you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, baby,\" said Gerald sternly, and his head appeared from below\r\nvery suddenly through interlacing brambles. \"No one asked you to go in\r\nthe dark. We'll leave you here if you like, and return and rescue you\r\nwith a boat. Jimmy, the bicycle lamp!\" He reached up a hand for it.\r\n\r\nJimmy produced from his bosom, the place where lamps are always kept in\r\nfairy stories--see Aladdin and others--a bicycle lamp.\r\n\r\n\"We brought it,\" he explained, \"so as not to break our shins over bits\r\nof long Mabel among the rhododendrons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Gerald very firmly, striking a match and opening the thick,\r\nrounded glass front of the bicycle lamp, \"I don't know what the rest of\r\nyou are going to do, but I'm going down these steps and along this\r\npassage. If we find the good hotel--well, a good hotel never hurt any\r\none yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no good, you know,\" said Jimmy weakly; \"you know jolly well you\r\ncan't get out of that Temple of Flora door, even if you get to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _don't_ know,\" said Gerald, still brisk and commander-like; \"there's\r\na secret spring inside that door most likely. We hadn't a lamp last time\r\nto look for it, remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there's one thing I do hate it's under-groundness,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"_You're_ not a coward,\" said Gerald, with what is known as diplomacy.\r\n\"_You're_ brave, Mabel. Don't I know it! You hold Jimmy's hand and I'll\r\nhold Cathy's. Now then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't have _my_ hand held,\" said Jimmy, of course. \"I'm not a kid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Cathy will. Poor little Cathy! Nice brother Jerry'll hold poor\r\nCathy's hand.\"\r\n\r\nGerald's bitter sarcasm missed fire here, for Cathy gratefully caught\r\nthe hand he held out in mockery. She was too miserable to read his mood,\r\nas she mostly did. \"Oh, thank you, Jerry dear,\" she said gratefully;\r\n\"you _are_ a dear, and I _will_ try not to be frightened.\" And for quite\r\na minute Gerald shamedly felt that he had not been quite, quite kind.\r\n\r\nSo now, leaving the growing goldness of the sunrise, the four went down\r\nthe stone steps that led to the underground and underwater passage, and\r\neverything seemed to grow dark and then to grow into a poor pretence of\r\nlight again, as the splendour of dawn gave place to the small dogged\r\nlighting of the bicycle lamp. The steps did indeed lead to a passage,\r\nthe beginnings of it choked with the drifted dead leaves of many old\r\nautumns. But presently the passage took a turn, there were more steps,\r\ndown, down, and then the passage was empty and straight--lined above and\r\nbelow and on each side with slabs of marble, very clear and clean.\r\nGerald held Cathy's hand with more of kindness and less of exasperation\r\nthan he had supposed possible.\r\n\r\nAnd Cathy, on her part, was surprised to find it possible to be so much\r\nless frightened than she expected.\r\n\r\nThe flame of the bull'seye threw ahead a soft circle of misty\r\nlight--the children followed it silently. Till, silently and suddenly,\r\nthe light of the bull's-eye behaved as the flame of a candle does when\r\nyou take it out into the sunlight to light a bonfire, or explode a train\r\nof gunpowder, or what not. Because now, with feelings mixed indeed, of\r\nwonder, and interest, and awe, but no fear, the children found\r\nthemselves in a great hall, whose arched roof was held up by two rows of\r\nround pillars, and whose every corner was filled with a soft, searching,\r\nlovely light, filling every cranny, as water fills the rocky secrecies\r\nof hidden sea-caves.\r\n\r\n\"How beautiful!\" Kathleen whispered, breathing hard into the tickled ear\r\nof her brother, and Mabel caught the hand of Jimmy and whispered, \"I\r\nmust hold your hand--I must hold on to something silly, or I shan't\r\nbelieve it's real.\"\r\n\r\nFor this hall in which the children found themselves was the most\r\nbeautiful place in the world. I won't describe it, because it does not\r\nlook the same to any two people, and you wouldn't understand me if I\r\ntried to tell you how it looked to any one of these four. But to each it\r\nseemed the most perfect thing possible. I will only say that all round\r\nit were great arches. Kathleen saw them as Moorish, Mabel as Tudor,\r\nGerald as Norman, and Jimmy as Churchwarden Gothic. (If you don't know\r\nwhat these are, ask your uncle who collects brasses, and he will\r\nexplain, or perhaps Mr. Millar will draw the different kinds of arches\r\nfor you.) And through these arches one could see many things--oh! but\r\nmany things. Through one appeared an olive garden, and in it two lovers\r\nwho held each other's hands, under an Italian moon; through another a\r\nwild sea, and a ship to whom the wild, racing sea was slave. A third\r\nshowed a king on his throne, his courtiers obsequious about him; and yet\r\na fourth showed a really good hotel, with the respectable Ugly-Wugly\r\nsunning himself on the front doorsteps. There was a mother, bending over\r\na wooden cradle. There was an artist gazing entranced on the picture his\r\nwet brush seemed to have that moment completed, a general dying on a\r\nfield where Victory had planted the standard he loved, and these things\r\nwere not pictures, but the truest truths, alive, and, as anyone could\r\nsee, immortal.\r\n\r\nMany other pictures there were that these arches framed. And all showed\r\nsome moment when life had sprung to fire and flower--the best that the\r\nsoul of man could ask or man's destiny grant. And the really good hotel\r\nhad its place here too, because there are some souls that ask no higher\r\nthing of life than \"a really good hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am glad we came; I am, I am!\" Kathleen murmured, and held fast to\r\nher brother's hand.\r\n\r\nThey went slowly up the hall, the ineffectual bull'seye, held by Jimmy,\r\nvery crooked indeed, showing almost as a shadow in this big, glorious\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when the hall's end was almost reached, the children saw where\r\nthe light came from. It glowed and spread itself from one place, and in\r\nthat place stood the one statue that Mabel \"did not know where to\r\nfind\"--the statue of Psyche. They went on, slowly, quite happy, quite\r\nbewildered. And when they came close to Psyche they saw that on her\r\nraised hand the ring showed dark.\r\n\r\nGerald let go Kathleen's hand, put his foot on the pediment, his knee on\r\nthe pedestal. He stood up, dark and human, beside the white girl with\r\nthe butterfly wings.\r\n\r\n\"I do hope you don't mind,\" he said, and drew the ring off very gently.\r\nThen, as he dropped to the ground, \"Not here,\" he said. \"I don't know\r\nwhy, but not here.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they all passed behind the white Psyche, and once more the bicycle\r\nlamp seemed suddenly to come to life again as Gerald held it in front of\r\nhim, to be the pioneer in the dark passage that led from the Hall of\r\n----, but they did not know, then, what it was the Hall of.\r\n\r\nThen, as the twisting passage shut in on them with a darkness that\r\npressed close against the little light of the bicycle lamp, Kathleen\r\nsaid, \"Give me the ring. I know exactly what to say.\"\r\n\r\nGerald gave it with not extreme readiness.\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" said Kathleen slowly, \"that no one at home may know that we've\r\nbeen out to-night, and I wish we were safe in our own beds, undressed,\r\nand in our nightgowns, and asleep.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the next thing any of them knew, it was good, strong, ordinary\r\ndaylight--not just sunrise, but the kind of daylight you are used to\r\nbeing called in, and all were in their own beds. Kathleen had framed the\r\nwish most sensibly. The only mistake had been in saying \"in our own\r\nbeds,\" because, of course, Mabel's own bed was at Yalding Towers, and to\r\nthis day Mabel's drab-haired aunt cannot understand how Mabel, who was\r\nstaying the night with that child in the town she was so taken up with,\r\nhadn't come home at eleven, when the aunt locked up, and yet she was in\r\nher bed in the morning. For though not a clever woman, she was not\r\nstupid enough to be able to believe any one of the eleven fancy\r\nexplanations which the distracted Mabel offered in the course of the\r\nmorning. The first (which makes twelve) of these explanations was The\r\nTruth, and of course the aunt was far too clever to believe That!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was show-day at Yalding Castle, and it seemed good to the children to\r\ngo and visit Mabel, and, as Gerald put it, to mingle unsuspected with\r\nthe crowd; to gloat over all the things which they knew and which the\r\ncrowd didn't know about the castle and the sliding panels, the magic\r\nring and the statues that came alive. Perhaps one of the pleasantest\r\nthings about magic happenings is the feeling which they give you of\r\nknowing what other people not only don't know but wouldn't, so to speak,\r\nbelieve if they did.\r\n\r\nOn the white road outside the gates of the castle was a dark spattering\r\nof breaks and wagonettes and dog-carts. Three or four waiting motor-cars\r\npuffed fatly where they stood, and bicycles sprawled in heaps along the\r\ngrassy hollow by the red brick wall. And the people who had been brought\r\nto the castle by the breaks and wagonettes, and dog-carts and bicycles\r\nand motors, as well as those who had walked there on their own unaided\r\nfeet, were scattered about the grounds, or being shown over those parts\r\nof the castle which were, on this one day of the week, thrown open to\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\nThere were more visitors than usual to-day because it had somehow been\r\nwhispered about that Lord Yalding was down, and that the holland covers\r\nwere to be taken off the state furniture, so that a rich American who\r\nwished to rent the castle, to live in, might see the place in all its\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nIt certainly did look very splendid. The embroidered satin, gilded\r\nleather and tapestry of the chairs, which had been hidden by brown\r\nholland, gave to the rooms a pleasant air of being lived in. There were\r\nflowering plants and pots of roses here and there on tables or\r\nwindow-ledges. Mabel's aunt prided herself on her tasteful touch in the\r\nhome, and had studied the arrangement of flowers in a series of articles\r\nin _Home Drivel_ called \"How to Make Home High-class on Ninepence a\r\nWeek.\"\r\n\r\nThe great crystal chandeliers, released from the bags that at ordinary\r\ntimes shrouded them, gleamed with grey and purple splendour. The brown\r\nlinen sheets had been taken off the state beds, and the red ropes that\r\nusually kept the low crowd in its proper place had been rolled up and\r\nhidden away.\r\n\r\n\"It's exactly as if we were calling on the family,\" said the grocer's\r\ndaughter from Salisbury to her friend who was in the millinery.\r\n\r\n\"If the Yankee doesn't take it, what do you say to you and me setting up\r\nhere when we get spliced?\" the draper's assistant asked his sweetheart.\r\nAnd she said: \"Oh, Reggie, how can you! you are _too_ funny.\"\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon the crowd in its smart holiday clothes, pink blouses,\r\nand light-coloured suits, flowery hats, and scarves beyond description\r\npassed through and through the dark hall, the magnificent drawing-rooms\r\nand boudoirs and picture-galleries. The chattering crowd was awed into\r\nsomething like quiet by the calm, stately bedchambers, where men had\r\nbeen born, and died; where royal guests had lain in long-ago summer\r\nnights, with big bow-pots of elder-flowers set on the hearth to ward off\r\nfever and evil spells. The terrace, where in old days dames in ruffs had\r\nsniffed the sweetbrier and southernwood of the borders below, and\r\nladies, bright with rouge and powder and brocade, had walked in the\r\nswing of their hooped skirts--the terrace now echoed to the sound of\r\nbrown boots, and the tap-tap of high-heeled shoes at two and eleven\r\nthree, and high laughter and chattering voices that said nothing that\r\nthe children wanted to hear. These spoiled for them the quiet of the\r\nenchanted castle, and outraged the peace of the garden of enchantments.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't such a lark after all,\" Gerald admitted, as from the window of\r\nthe stone summer-house at the end of the terrace they watched the loud\r\ncolours and heard the loud laughter. \"I do hate to see all these people\r\nin _our_ garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said that to that nice bailiff-man this morning,\" said Mabel, setting\r\nherself on the stone floor, \"and he said it wasn't much to let them\r\ncome once a week. He said Lord Yalding ought to let them come when they\r\nliked--said he would if he lived there.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all he knows!\" said Jimmy. \"Did he say anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lots,\" said Mabel. \"I do like him! I told him----\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I told him lots about our adventures. The humble bailiff is a\r\nbeautiful listener.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall be locked up for beautiful lunatics if you let your jaw get\r\nthe better of you, my Mabel child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not us!\" said Mabel. \"I told it--you know the way--every word true, and\r\nyet so that nobody believes any of it. When I'd quite done he said I'd\r\ngot a real littery talent, and I promised to put his name on the\r\nbeginning of the first book I write when I grow up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know his name,\" said Kathleen. \"Let's do something with the\r\nring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Imposs!\" said Gerald. \"I forgot to tell you, but I met Mademoiselle\r\nwhen I went back for my garters--and she's coming to meet us and walk\r\nback with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said,\" said Gerald deliberately, \"that it was very kind of her. And\r\nso it was. Us not wanting her doesn't make it not kind her coming----\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be kind, but it's sickening too,\" said Mabel, \"because now I\r\nsuppose we shall have to stick here and wait for her; and I promised\r\nwe'd meet the bailiff-man. He's going to bring things in a basket and\r\nhave a picnic-tea with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beyond the dinosaurus. He said he'd tell me all about the\r\nanteddy-something animals--it means before Noah's Ark; there are lots\r\nbesides the dinosaurus--in return for me telling him my agreeable\r\nfictions. Yes, he called them that.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the gates shut. That's five.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might take Mademoiselle along,\" suggested Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"She'd be too proud to have tea with a bailiff, I expect; you never know\r\nhow grown-ups will take the simplest things.\" It was Kathleen who said\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you what,\" said Gerald, lazily turning on the stone\r\nbench. \"You all go along, and meet your bailiff. A picnic's a picnic.\r\nAnd I'll wait for Mademoiselle.\"\r\n\r\nMabel remarked joyously that this was jolly decent of Gerald, to which\r\nhe modestly replied: \"Oh, rot!\"\r\n\r\nJimmy added that Gerald rather liked sucking-up to people.\r\n\r\n\"Little boys don't understand diplomacy,\" said Gerald calmly;\r\n\"sucking-up is simply silly. But it's better to be good than pretty\r\nand----\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" Jimmy asked.\r\n\r\n\"And,\" his brother went on, \"you never know when a grown-up may come in\r\nuseful. Besides, they _like_ it. You must give them _some_ little\r\npleasures. Think how awful it must be to be old. My hat!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope _I_ shan't be an old maid,\" said Kathleen.\r\n\r\n\"I don't _mean_ to be,\" said Mabel briskly. \"I'd rather marry a\r\ntravelling tinker.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be rather nice,\" Kathleen mused, \"to marry the Gipsy King and\r\ngo about in a caravan telling fortunes and hung round with baskets and\r\nbrooms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if I could choose,\" said Mabel, \"of course, I'd marry a brigand,\r\nand live in his mountain fastnesses, and be kind to his captives and\r\nhelp them to escape and----\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll be a real treasure to your husband,\" said Gerald.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Kathleen, \"or a sailor would be nice. You'd watch for his\r\nship coming home and set the lamp in the dormer window to light him home\r\nthrough the storm; and when he was drowned at sea you'd be most\r\nfrightfully sorry, and go every day to lay flowers on his daisied\r\ngrave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Mabel hastened to say, \"or a soldier, and then you'd go to the\r\nwars with short petticoats and a cocked hat and a barrel round your neck\r\nlike a St. Bernard dog. There's a picture of a soldier's wife on a song\r\nauntie's got. It's called 'The Veevandyear.'\"\r\n\r\n\"When I marry----\" Kathleen quickly said.\r\n\r\n\"When _I_ marry,\" said Gerald, \"I'll marry a dumb girl, or else get the\r\nring to make her so that she can't speak unless she's spoken to. Let's\r\nhave a squint.\"\r\n\r\nHe applied his eye to the stone lattice.\r\n\r\n\"They're moving off,\" he said. \"Those pink and purple hats are nodding\r\noff in the distant prospect; and the funny little man with the beard\r\nlike a goat is going a different way from every one else--the gardeners\r\nwill have to head him off. I don't see Mademoiselle, though. The rest of\r\nyou had better bunk. It doesn't do to run any risks with picnics. The\r\ndeserted hero of our tale, alone and unsupported, urged on his brave\r\nfollowers to pursue the commissariat waggons, he himself remaining at\r\nthe post of danger and difficulty, because he was born to stand on\r\nburning decks whence all but he had fled, and to lead forlorn hopes when\r\ndespaired of by the human race!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I'll marry a dumb husband,\" said Mabel, \"and there shan't be\r\nany heroes in my books when I write them, only a heroine. Come on,\r\nCathy.\"\r\n\r\nComing out of that cool, shadowy summer-house into the sunshine was like\r\nstepping into an oven, and the stone of the terrace was burning to the\r\nchildren's feet.\r\n\r\n\"I know now what a cat on hot bricks feels like,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\nThe antediluvian animals are set in a beech-wood on a slope at least\r\nhalf a mile across the park from the castle. The grandfather of the\r\npresent Lord Yalding had them set there in the middle of last century,\r\nin the great days of the late Prince Consort, the Exhibition of 1851,\r\nSir Joseph Paxton, and the Crystal Palace. Their stone flanks, their\r\nwide, ungainly wings, their lozenged crocodile-like backs show grey\r\nthrough the trees a long way off.\r\n\r\nMost people think that noon is the hottest time of the day. They are\r\nwrong. A cloudless sky gets hotter and hotter all the afternoon, and\r\nreaches its very hottest at five. I am sure you must all have noticed\r\nthis when you are going out to tea anywhere in your best clothes,\r\nespecially if your clothes are starched and you happen to have a rather\r\nlong and shadeless walk.\r\n\r\nKathleen, Mabel, and Jimmy got hotter and hotter, and went more and more\r\nslowly. They had almost reached that stage of resentment and discomfort\r\nwhen one \"wishes one hadn't come\" before they saw, below the edge of the\r\nbeech-wood, the white waved handkerchief of the bailiff.\r\n\r\nThat banner, eloquent of tea, shade, and being able to sit down, put new\r\nheart into them. They mended their pace, and a final desperate run\r\nlanded them among the drifted coppery leaves and bare grey and green\r\nroots of the beech-wood.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, glory!\" said Jimmy, throwing himself down. \"How do you do?\"\r\n\r\nThe bailiff looked very nice, the girls thought. He was not wearing his\r\nvelveteens, but a grey flannel suit that an Earl need not have scorned;\r\nand his straw hat would have done no discredit to a Duke; and a Prince\r\ncould not have worn a prettier green tie. He welcomed the children\r\nwarmly. And there were two baskets dumped heavy and promising among the\r\nbeech-leaves.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of tact. The hot, instructive tour of the stone\r\nantediluvians, which had loomed with ever-lessening charm before the\r\nchildren, was not even mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"You must be desert-dry,\" he said, \"and you'll be hungry, too, when\r\nyou've done being thirsty. I put on the kettle as soon as I discerned\r\nthe form of my fair romancer in the extreme offing.\"\r\n\r\nThe kettle introduced itself with puffings and bubblings from the hollow\r\nbetween two grey roots where it sat on a spirit-lamp.\r\n\r\n\"Take off your shoes and stockings, won't you?\" said the bailiff in\r\nmatter-of-course tones, just as old ladies ask each other to take off\r\ntheir bonnets; \"there's a little baby canal just over the ridge.\"\r\n\r\nThe joys of dipping one's feet in cool running water after a hot walk\r\nhave yet to be described. I could write pages about them. There was a\r\nmill-stream when I was young with little fishes in it, and dropped\r\nleaves that spun round, and willows and alders that leaned over it and\r\nkept it cool, and--but this is not the story of _my_ life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JOYS OF DIPPING ONE'S FEET IN COOL RUNNING WATER.]\r\n\r\nWhen they came back, on rested, damp, pink feet, tea was made and poured\r\nout, delicious tea, with as much milk as ever you wanted, out of a beer\r\nbottle with a screw top, and cakes, and gingerbread, and plums, and a\r\nbig melon with a lump of ice in its heart--a tea for the gods!\r\n\r\nThis thought must have come to Jimmy, for he said suddenly, removing his\r\nface from inside a wide-bitten crescent of melon-rind:--\r\n\r\n\"Your feast's as good as the feast of the Immortals, almost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain your recondite allusion,\" said the grey-flanneled host; and\r\nJimmy, understanding him to say, \"What do you mean?\" replied with the\r\nwhole tale of that wonderful night when the statues came alive, and a\r\nbanquet of unearthly splendour and deliciousness was plucked by marble\r\nhands from the trees of the lake island.\r\n\r\nWhen he had done the bailiff said:--\r\n\r\n\"Did you get all this out of a book?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jimmy, \"it happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are an imaginative set of young dreamers, aren't you?\" the bailiff\r\nasked, handing the plums to Kathleen, who smiled, friendly but\r\nembarrassed. Why couldn't Jimmy have held his tongue?\r\n\r\n\"No, we're not,\" said that indiscreet one obstinately; \"everything I've\r\ntold you _did_ happen, and so did the things Mabel told you.\"\r\n\r\nThe bailiff looked a little uncomfortable. \"All right, old chap,\" he\r\nsaid. And there was a short, uneasy silence.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Jimmy, who seemed for once to have got the bit between\r\nhis teeth, \"do you believe me or not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be silly, Jimmy!\" Kathleen whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Because, if you don't I'll _make_ you believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't!\" said Mabel and Kathleen together.\r\n\r\n\"Do you or don't you?\" Jimmy insisted, lying on his front with his chin\r\non his hands, his elbows on a moss-cushion, and his bare legs kicking\r\namong the beech-leaves.\r\n\r\n\"I think you tell adventures awfully well,\" said the bailiff cautiously.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Jimmy, abruptly sitting up, \"you don't believe me.\r\nNonsense, Cathy! he's a gentleman, even if he is a bailiff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you!\" said the bailiff with eyes that twinkled.\r\n\r\n\"You won't tell, will you?\" Jimmy urged.\r\n\r\n\"Tell what?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Anything._\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not. I am, as you say, the soul of honour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then--Cathy, give me the ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _no_!\" said the girls together.\r\n\r\nKathleen did not mean to give up the ring; Mabel did not mean that she\r\nshould; Jimmy certainly used no force. Yet presently he held it in his\r\nhand. It was his hour. There are times like that for all of us, when\r\nwhat we say shall be done _is_ done.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Jimmy, \"this is the ring Mabel told you about. I say it is a\r\nwishing-ring. And if you will put it on your hand and wish, whatever you\r\nwish will happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must I wish out loud?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't wish for anything silly,\" said Kathleen, making the best of the\r\nsituation, \"like its being fine on Tuesday or its being your favourite\r\npudding for dinner to-morrow. Wish for something you really want.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said the bailiff. \"I'll wish for the only thing I really want.\r\nI wish my--I wish my friend were here.\"\r\n\r\nThe three who knew the power of the ring looked round to see the\r\nbailiff's friend appear; a surprised man that friend would be, they\r\nthought, and perhaps a frightened one. They had all risen, and stood\r\nready to soothe and reassure the new-comer. But no startled gentleman\r\nappeared in the wood, only, coming quietly through the dappled sun and\r\nshadow under the beech-trees, Mademoiselle and Gerald, Mademoiselle in a\r\nwhite gown, looking quite nice and like a picture, Gerald hot and\r\npolite.\r\n\r\n\"Good-afternoon,\" said that dauntless leader of forlorn hopes. \"I\r\npersuaded Mademoiselle----\"\r\n\r\nThat sentence was never finished, for the bailiff and the French\r\ngoverness were looking at each other with the eyes of tired travellers\r\nwho find, quite without expecting it, the desired end of a very long\r\njourney. And the children saw that even if they spoke it would not make\r\nany difference.\r\n\r\n\"_You!_\" said the bailiff.\r\n\r\n\"Mais ... c'est donc vous,\" said Mademoiselle, in a funny choky voice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEY STOOD STILL AND LOOKED AT EACH OTHER.]\r\n\r\nAnd they stood still and looked at each other, \"like stuck pigs,\" as\r\nJimmy said later, for quite a long time.\r\n\r\n\"Is _she_ your friend?\" Jimmy asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--oh yes,\" said this bailiff. \"You are my friend, are you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"But yes,\" Mademoiselle said softly. \"I am your friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"There! you see,\" said Jimmy, \"the ring _does_ do what I said.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't quarrel about that,\" said the bailiff. \"You can say it's the\r\nring. For me--it's a coincidence--the happiest, the dearest----\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you----?\" said the French governess.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said the bailiff. \"Jimmy, give your brother some tea.\r\nMademoiselle, come and walk in the woods: there are a thousand things to\r\nsay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eat then, my Gerald,\" said Mademoiselle, now grown young, and\r\nastonishingly like a fairy princess. \"I return all at the hour, and we\r\nre-enter together. It is that we must speak each other. It is long time\r\nthat we have not seen us, me and Lord Yalding!\"\r\n\r\n\"So he was Lord Yalding all the time,\" said Jimmy, breaking a stupefied\r\nsilence as the white gown and the grey flannels disappeared among the\r\nbeech-trunks. \"Landscape painter sort of dodge--silly, I call it. And\r\nfancy her being a friend of his, and his wishing she was here! Different\r\nfrom us, eh? Good old ring!\"\r\n\r\n\"His friend!\" said Mabel with strong scorn: \"don't you see she's his\r\nlover? Don't you see she's the lady that was bricked up in the convent,\r\nbecause he was so poor, and he couldn't find her. And now the ring's\r\nmade them live happy ever after. I _am_ glad! Aren't you, Cathy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather!\" said Kathleen; \"it's as good as marrying a sailor or a\r\nbandit.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the ring did it,\" said Jimmy. \"If the American takes the house\r\nhe'll pay lots of rent, and they can live on that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if they'll be married to-morrow!\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it be fun if we were bridesmaids,\" said Cathy.\r\n\r\n\"May I trouble you for the melon,\" said Gerald. \"Thanks! Why didn't we\r\nknow he was Lord Yalding? Apes and moles that we were!\"\r\n\r\n\"_I've_ known since last night,\" said Mabel calmly; \"only I promised not\r\nto tell. I _can_ keep a secret, can't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Too jolly well,\" said Kathleen, a little aggrieved.\r\n\r\n\"He was disguised as a bailiff,\" said Jimmy; \"that's why we didn't\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Disguised as a fiddle-stick-end,\" said Gerald. \"Ha, ha! I see something\r\nold Sherlock Holmes never saw, nor that idiot Watson, either. If you\r\nwant a really impenetrable disguise, you ought to disguise yourself as\r\nwhat you really are. I'll remember that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's like Mabel, telling things so that you can't believe them,\" said\r\nCathy.\r\n\r\n\"I think Mademoiselle's jolly lucky,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"She's not so bad. He might have done worse,\" said Gerald. \"Plums,\r\nplease!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was quite plainly magic at work. Mademoiselle next morning was a\r\nchanged governess. Her cheeks were pink, her lips were red, her eyes\r\nwere larger and brighter, and she had done her hair in an entirely new\r\nway, rather frivolous and very becoming.\r\n\r\n\"Mamselle's coming out!\" Eliza remarked.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast Lord Yalding called with a wagonette that\r\nwore a smart blue cloth coat, and was drawn by two horses whose coats\r\nwere brown and shining and fitted them even better than the blue cloth\r\ncoat fitted the wagonette, and the whole party drove in state and\r\nsplendour to Yalding Towers.\r\n\r\nArrived there, the children clamoured for permission to explore the\r\ncastle thoroughly, a thing that had never yet been possible. Lord\r\nYalding, a little absent in manner, but yet quite cordial, consented.\r\nMabel showed the others all the secret doors and unlikely passages and\r\nstairs that she had discovered. It was a glorious morning. Lord Yalding\r\nand Mademoiselle went through the house, it is true, but in a rather\r\nhalf-hearted way. Quite soon they were tired, and went out through the\r\nFrench windows of the drawing-room and through the rose garden, to sit\r\non the curved stone seat in the middle of the maze, where once, at the\r\nbeginning of things, Gerald, Kathleen, and Jimmy had found the sleeping\r\nPrincess who wore pink silk and diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe children felt that their going left to the castle a more spacious\r\nfreedom, and explored with more than Arctic enthusiasm. It was as they\r\nemerged from the little rickety secret staircase that led from the\r\npowdering-room of the state suite to the gallery of the hall that they\r\ncame suddenly face to face with the odd little man who had a beard like\r\na goat and had taken the wrong turning yesterday.\r\n\r\n\"This part of the castle is private,\" said Mabel, with great presence of\r\nmind, and shut the door behind her.\r\n\r\n\"I am aware of it,\" said the goat-faced stranger, \"but I have the\r\npermission of the Earl of Yalding to examine the house _at_ my leisure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Mabel. \"I beg your pardon. We all do. We didn't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are relatives of his lordship, I should surmise?\" asked the\r\ngoat-faced.\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" said Gerald. \"Friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman was thin and very neatly dressed; he had small, merry eyes\r\nand a face that was brown and dry-looking.\r\n\r\n\"You are playing some game, I should suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said Gerald, \"only exploring.\"\r\n\r\n\"May a stranger propose himself as a member of your Exploring\r\nExpedition?\" asked the gentleman, smiling a tight but kind smile.\r\n\r\nThe children looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Gerald, \"it's rather difficult to explain--but--you see\r\nwhat I mean, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He means,\" said Jimmy, \"that we can't take you into an exploring party\r\nwithout we know what you want to go for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you a photographer?\" asked Mabel, \"or is it some newspaper's sent\r\nyou to write about the Towers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand your position,\" said the gentleman. \"I am not a\r\nphotographer, nor am I engaged by any journal. I am a man of independent\r\nmeans, travelling in this country with the intention of renting a\r\nresidence. My name is Jefferson D. Conway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Mabel; \"then you're the American millionaire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not like the description, young lady,\" said Mr. Jefferson D.\r\nConway. \"I am an American citizen, and I am not without means. This is a\r\nfine property--a very fine property. If it were for sale----\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't, it can't be,\" Mabel hastened to explain. \"The lawyers have\r\nput it in a tale, so Lord Yalding can't sell it. But you could take it\r\nto live in, and pay Lord Yalding a good millionairish rent, and then he\r\ncould marry the French governess----\"\r\n\r\n\"Shish!\" said Kathleen and Mr. Jefferson D. Conway together, and he\r\nadded:--\r\n\r\n\"Lead the way, please; and I should suggest that the exploration be\r\ncomplete and exhaustive.\"\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Mabel led the millionaire through all the castle. He\r\nseemed pleased, yet disappointed too.\r\n\r\n\"It is a fine mansion,\" he said at last when they had come back to the\r\npoint from which they had started; \"but I should suppose, in a house\r\nthis size, there would mostly be a secret stairway, or a priests' hiding\r\nplace, or a ghost?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are,\" said Mabel briefly, \"but I thought Americans didn't believe\r\nin anything but machinery and newspapers.\" She touched the spring of the\r\npanel behind her, and displayed the little tottery staircase to the\r\nAmerican. The sight of it worked a wonderful transformation in him. He\r\nbecame eager, alert, very keen.\r\n\r\n\"Say!\" he cried, over and over again, standing in the door that led from\r\nthe powdering-room to the state bed-chamber. \"But this is great--great!\"\r\n\r\nThe hopes of every one ran high. It seemed almost certain that the\r\ncastle would be let for a millionairish rent and Lord Yalding be made\r\naffluent to the point of marriage.\r\n\r\n\"If there were a ghost located in this ancestral pile, I'd close with\r\nthe Earl of Yalding to-day, now, on the nail,\" Mr. Jefferson D. Conway\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n\"If you were to stay till to-morrow, and sleep in this room, I expect\r\nyou'd see the ghost,\" said Mabel.\r\n\r\n\"There _is_ a ghost located here then?\" he said joyously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HE BECAME EAGER, ALERT, VERY KEEN.]\r\n\r\n\"They say,\" Mabel answered, \"that old Sir Rupert, who lost his head in\r\nHenry the Eighth's time, walks of a night here, with his head under his\r\narm. But we've not seen that. What we have seen is the lady in a pink\r\ndress with diamonds in her hair. She carries a lighted taper,\" Mabel\r\nhastily added. The others, now suddenly aware of Mabel's plan, hastened\r\nto assure the American in accents of earnest truth that they had all\r\nseen the lady with the pink gown.\r\n\r\nHe looked at them with half-closed eyes that twinkled.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I calculate to ask the Earl of Yalding to permit me to\r\npass a night in his ancestral best bed-chamber. And if I hear so much as\r\na phantom footstep, or hear so much as a ghostly sigh, I'll take the\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _am_ glad!\" said Cathy.\r\n\r\n\"You appear to be very certain of your ghost,\" said the American, still\r\nfixing them with little eyes that shone. \"Let me tell you, young\r\ngentlemen, that I carry a gun, and when I see a ghost, I shoot.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled a pistol out of his hip-pocket, and looked at it lovingly.\r\n\r\n\"And I am a fair average shot,\" he went on, walking across the shiny\r\nfloor of the state bed-chamber to the open window. \"See that big red\r\nrose, like a tea-saucer?\"\r\n\r\nThey saw.\r\n\r\nThe next moment a loud report broke the stillness, and the red petals of\r\nthe shattered rose strewed balustrade and terrace.\r\n\r\nThe American looked from one child to another. Every face was perfectly\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n\"Jefferson D. Conway made his little pile by strict attention to\r\nbusiness, and keeping his eyes skinned,\" he added. \"Thank you for all\r\nyour kindness.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you'd done it, and he'd shot you!\" said Jimmy cheerfully. \"That\r\n_would_ have been an adventure, wouldn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to do it still,\" said Mabel, pale and defiant. \"Let's find\r\nLord Yalding and get the ring back.\"\r\n\r\nLord Yalding had had an interview with Mabel's aunt, and lunch for six\r\nwas laid in the great dark hall, among the armour and the oak\r\nfurniture--a beautiful lunch served on silver dishes. Mademoiselle,\r\nbecoming every moment younger and more like a Princess, was moved to\r\ntears when Gerald rose, lemonade-glass in hand, and proposed the health\r\nof \"Lord and Lady Yalding.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Yalding had returned thanks in a speech full of agreeable\r\njokes the moment seemed to Gerald propitious, and he said:--\r\n\r\n\"The ring, you know--you don't believe in it, but we do. May we have it\r\nback?\"\r\n\r\nAnd got it.\r\n\r\nThen, after a hasty council, held in the panelled jewel-room, Mabel\r\nsaid: \"This is a wishing-ring, and I wish all the American's weapons of\r\nall sorts were here.\"\r\n\r\nInstantly the room was full--six feet up the wall--of a tangle and mass\r\nof weapons, swords, spears, arrows, tomahawks, fowling pieces,\r\nblunderbusses, pistols, revolvers, scimitars, kreeses--every kind of\r\nweapon you can think of--and the four children wedged in among all these\r\nweapons of death hardly dared to breathe.\r\n\r\n\"He collects arms, I expect,\" said Gerald, \"and the arrows are poisoned,\r\nI shouldn't wonder. Wish them back where they came from, Mabel, for\r\ngoodness' sake, and try again.\"\r\n\r\nMabel wished the weapons away, and at once the four children stood safe\r\nin a bare panelled room. But--\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Mabel said, \"I can't stand it. We'll work the ghost another way. I\r\nwish the American may think he sees a ghost when he goes to bed. Sir\r\nRupert with his head under his arm will do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it to-night he sleeps there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I wish he may see Sir Rupert every night--that'll make it\r\nall serene.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's rather dull,\" said Gerald; \"we shan't know whether he's seen Sir\r\nRupert or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall know in the morning, when he takes the house.\"\r\n\r\nThis being settled, Mabel's aunt was found to be desirous of Mabel's\r\ncompany, so the others went home.\r\n\r\nIt was when they were at supper that Lord Yalding suddenly appeared, and\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Jefferson Conway wants you boys to spend the night with him in the\r\nstate chamber. I've had beds put up. You don't mind, do you? He seems\r\nto think you've got some idea of playing ghost-tricks on him.\"\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to refuse, so difficult that it proved impossible.\r\n\r\nTen o'clock found the boys each in a narrow white bed that looked quite\r\nabsurdly small in that high, dark chamber, and in face of that tall\r\ngaunt four-poster hung with tapestry and ornamented with\r\nfunereal-looking plumes.\r\n\r\n\"I hope to goodness there isn't a _real_ ghost,\" Jimmy whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Not likely,\" Gerald whispered back.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't want to see Sir Rupert's ghost with its head under its\r\narm,\" Jimmy insisted.\r\n\r\n\"You won't. The most you'll see'll be the millionaire seeing it. Mabel\r\nsaid he was to see it, not us. Very likely you'll sleep all night and\r\nnot see anything. Shut your eyes and count up to a million and don't be\r\na goat!\"\r\n\r\nBut he was reckoning without Mabel and the ring. As soon as Mabel had\r\nlearned from her drab-haired aunt that this was indeed the night when\r\nMr. Jefferson D. Conway would sleep at the castle she had hastened to\r\nadd a wish, \"that Sir Rupert and his head may appear to-night in the\r\nstate bedroom.\"\r\n\r\nJimmy shut his eyes and began to count a million. Before he had counted\r\nit he fell asleep. So did his brother.\r\n\r\nThey were awakened by the loud echoing bang of a pistol shot. Each\r\nthought of the shot that had been fired that morning, and opened eyes\r\nthat expected to see a sunshiny terrace and red-rose petals strewn upon\r\nwarm white stone.\r\n\r\nInstead, there was the dark, lofty state chamber, lighted but little by\r\nsix tall candles; there was the American in shirt and trousers, a\r\nsmoking pistol in his hand; and there, advancing from the door of the\r\npowdering-room, a figure in doublet and hose, a ruff round its neck--and\r\nno head! The head, sure enough, was there; but it was under the right\r\narm, held close in the slashed-velvet sleeve of the doublet. The face\r\nlooking from under the arm wore a pleasant smile. Both boys, I am sorry\r\nto say, screamed. The American fired again. The bullet passed through\r\nSir Rupert, who advanced without appearing to notice it.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, the lights went out. The next thing the boys knew it was\r\nmorning. A grey daylight shone blankly through the tall windows--and\r\nwild rain was beating upon the glass, and the American was gone.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we?\" said Jimmy, sitting up with tangled hair and looking\r\nround him. \"Oh, I remember. Ugh! it was horrid. I'm about fed up with\r\nthat ring, so I don't mind telling you.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AMERICAN FIRED AGAIN.]\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said Gerald. \"I enjoyed it. I wasn't a bit frightened, were\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Jimmy, \"of course I wasn't.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We've done the trick,\" said Gerald later when they learned that the\r\nAmerican had breakfasted early with Lord Yalding and taken the first\r\ntrain to London; \"he's gone to get rid of his other house, and take\r\nthis one. The old ring's beginning to do really useful things.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you'll believe in the ring now,\" said Jimmy to Lord Yalding,\r\nwhom he met later on in the picture-gallery; \"it's all our doing that\r\nMr. Jefferson saw the ghost. He told us he'd take the house if he saw a\r\nghost, so of course we took care he did see one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you did, did you?\" said Lord Yalding in rather an odd voice. \"I'm\r\nvery much obliged, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" said Jimmy kindly. \"I thought you'd be pleased and\r\nhim too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you'll be interested to learn,\" said Lord Yalding, putting his\r\nhands in his pockets and staring down at Jimmy, \"that Mr. Jefferson D.\r\nConway was so pleased with your ghost that he got me out of bed at six\r\no'clock this morning to talk about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ripping!\" said Jimmy. \"What did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said, as far as I can remember,\" said Lord Yalding, still in the\r\nsame strange voice--\"he said: 'My lord, your ancestral pile is A1. It\r\nis, in fact, The Limit. Its luxury is palatial, its grounds are nothing\r\nshort of Edenesque. No expense has been spared, I should surmise. Your\r\nancestors were whole-hoggers. They have done the thing as it should be\r\ndone--every detail attended to. I like your tapestry, and I like your\r\noak, and I like your secret stairs. But I think your ancestors should\r\nhave left well enough alone, and stopped at that.' So I said they had,\r\nas far as I knew, and he shook his head and said:--\r\n\r\n\"'No, sir. Your ancestors take the air of a night with their heads under\r\ntheir arms. A ghost that sighed or glided or rustled I could have stood,\r\nand thanked you for it, and considered it in the rent. But a ghost that\r\nbullets go through while it stands grinning with a bare neck and its\r\nhead loose under its own arm and little boys screaming and fainting in\r\ntheir beds--no! What I say is, If this is a British hereditary\r\nhigh-toned family ghost, excuse Me!' And he went off by the early\r\ntrain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" the stricken Jimmy remarked, \"I _am_ sorry, and I don't think\r\nwe did faint, really I don't--but we thought it would be just what you\r\nwanted. And perhaps some one else will take the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know any one else rich enough,\" said Lord Yalding. \"Mr. Conway\r\ncame the day before he said he would, or you'd never have got hold of\r\nhim. And I don't know how you did it, and I don't want to know. It was a\r\nrather silly trick.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a gloomy pause. The rain beat against the long windows.\r\n\r\n\"I say\"--Jimmy looked up at Lord Yalding with the light of a new idea in\r\nhis round face. \"I say, if you're hard up, why don't you sell your\r\njewels?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any jewels, you meddlesome young duffer,\" said Lord Yalding\r\nquite crossly; and taking his hands out of his pockets, he began to\r\nwalk away.\r\n\r\n\"I mean the ones in the panelled room with the stars in the ceiling,\"\r\nJimmy insisted, following him.\r\n\r\n\"There aren't any,\" said Lord Yalding shortly; \"and if this is some more\r\nring-nonsense I advise you to be careful, young man. I've had about as\r\nmuch as I care for.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's _not_ ring-nonsense,\" said Jimmy: \"there are shelves and shelves\r\nof beautiful family jewels. You can sell them and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _no_!\" cried Mademoiselle, appearing like an oleograph of a duchess\r\nin the door of the picture-gallery; \"don't sell the family jewels----\"\r\n\r\n\"There aren't any, my lady,\" said Lord Yalding, going towards her. \"I\r\nthought you were never coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, aren't there!\" said Mabel, who had followed Mademoiselle. \"You just\r\ncome and see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see what they will to show us,\" cried Mademoiselle, for Lord\r\nYalding did not move; \"it should at least be amusing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\nSo they went, Mabel and Jimmy leading, while Mademoiselle and Lord\r\nYalding followed, hand in hand.\r\n\r\n\"It's much safer to walk hand in hand,\" said Lord Yalding; \"with these\r\nchildren at large one never knows what may happen next.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nIT would be interesting, no doubt, to describe the feelings of Lord\r\nYalding as he followed Mabel and Jimmy through his ancestral halls, but\r\nI have no means of knowing at all what he felt. Yet one must suppose\r\nthat he felt something: bewilderment, perhaps, mixed with a faint\r\nwonder, and a desire to pinch himself to see if he were dreaming. Or he\r\nmay have pondered the rival questions, \"Am I mad?\" \"Are they mad?\"\r\nwithout being at all able to decide which he ought to try to answer, let\r\nalone deciding what, in either case, the answer ought to be. You see,\r\nthe children did seem to believe in the odd stories they told--and the\r\nwish _had_ come true, and the ghost _had_ appeared. He must have\r\nthought--but all this is vain; I don't _really_ know what he thought any\r\nmore than you do.\r\n\r\nNor can I give you any clue to the thoughts and feelings of\r\nMademoiselle. I only know that she was very happy, but any one would\r\nhave known that if they had seen her face. Perhaps this is as good a\r\nmoment as any to explain that when her guardian had put her in a convent\r\nso that she should not sacrifice her fortune by marrying a poor lord,\r\nher guardian had secured that fortune (to himself) by going off with it\r\nto South America. Then, having no money left, Mademoiselle had to work\r\nfor it. So she went out as governess, and took the situation she did\r\ntake because it was near Lord Yalding's home. She wanted to see him,\r\neven though she thought he had forsaken her and did not love her any\r\nmore. And now she had seen him. I daresay she thought about some of\r\nthese things as she went along through his house, her hand held in his.\r\nBut of course I can't be sure.\r\n\r\nJimmy's thoughts, of course, I can read like any old book. He thought,\r\n\"Now he'll _have_ to believe me.\" That Lord Yalding should believe him\r\nhad become, quite unreasonably, the most important thing in the world to\r\nJimmy. He wished that Gerald and Kathleen were there to share his\r\ntriumph, but they were helping Mabel's aunt to cover the grand furniture\r\nup, and so were out of what followed. Not that they missed much, for\r\nwhen Mabel proudly said, \"Now you'll see,\" and the others came close\r\nround her in the little panelled room, there was a pause, and\r\nthen--nothing happened at all!\r\n\r\n\"There's a secret spring here somewhere,\" said Mabel, fumbling with\r\nfingers that had suddenly grown hot and damp.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" said Lord Yalding.\r\n\r\n\"_Here_,\" said Mabel impatiently, \"only I can't find it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she couldn't. She found the spring of the secret panel under the\r\nwindow all right, but that seemed to every one dull compared with the\r\njewels that every one had pictured and two at least had seen. But the\r\nspring that made the oak panelling slide away and displayed jewels\r\nplainly to any eye worth a king's ransom--this could not be found.\r\nMore, it was simply not there. There could be no doubt of that. Every\r\ninch of the panelling was felt by careful fingers. The earnest protests\r\nof Mabel and Jimmy died away presently in a silence made painful by the\r\nhotness of one's ears, the discomfort of not liking to meet any one's\r\neyes, and the resentful feeling that the spring was not behaving in at\r\nall a sportsmanlike way, and that, in a word, this was not cricket.\r\n\r\n\"You see!\" said Lord Yalding severely. \"Now you've had your joke, if you\r\ncall it a joke, and I've had enough of the whole silly business. Give me\r\nthe ring--it's mine, I suppose, since you say you found it somewhere\r\nhere--and don't let's hear another word about all this rubbish of magic\r\nand enchantment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gerald's got the ring,\" said Mabel miserably.\r\n\r\n\"Then go and fetch him,\" said Lord Yalding--\"both of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe melancholy pair retired, and Lord Yalding spent the time of their\r\nabsence in explaining to Mademoiselle how very unimportant jewels were\r\ncompared with other things.\r\n\r\nThe four children came back together.\r\n\r\n\"We've had enough of this ring business,\" said Lord Yalding. \"Give it to\r\nme, and we'll say no more about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I can't get it off,\" said Gerald. \"It--it always did have a will of\r\nits own.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll soon get it off,\" said Lord Yalding. But he didn't. \"We'll try\r\nsoap,\" he said firmly. Four out of his five hearers knew just exactly\r\nhow much use soap would be.\r\n\r\n\"They won't believe about the jewels,\" wailed Mabel, suddenly dissolved\r\nin tears, \"and I can't find the spring. I've felt all over--we all\r\nhave--it was just here, and----\"\r\n\r\nHer fingers felt it just as she spoke; and as she ceased to speak the\r\ncarved panels slid away, and the blue velvet shelves laden with jewels\r\nwere disclosed to the unbelieving eyes of Lord Yalding and the lady who\r\nwas to be his wife.\r\n\r\n\"Jove!\" said Lord Yalding.\r\n\r\n\"_Misericorde!_\" said the lady.\r\n\r\n\"But why _now_?\" gasped Mabel. \"Why not before?\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect it's magic,\" said Gerald. \"There's no real spring here, and it\r\ncouldn't act because the ring wasn't here. You know Phoebus told us\r\nthe ring was the heart of all the magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut it up and take the ring away and see.\"\r\n\r\nThey did, and Gerald was (as usual, he himself pointed out) proved to be\r\nright. When the ring was away there was no spring; when the ring was in\r\nthe room there (as Mabel urged) was the spring all right enough.\r\n\r\n\"So you see,\" said Mabel to Lord Yalding.\r\n\r\n\"I see that the spring's very artfully concealed,\" said that dense peer.\r\n\"I think it was very clever indeed of you to find it. And if those\r\njewels are real----\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they're real,\" said Mabel indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyway,\" said Lord Yalding, \"thank you all very much. I think\r\nit's clearing up. I'll send the wagonette home with you after lunch. And\r\nif you don't mind, I'll have the ring.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour of soap and water produced no effect whatever, except to\r\nmake the finger of Gerald very red and very sore. Then Lord Yalding said\r\nsomething very impatient indeed, and then Gerald suddenly became angry\r\nand said: \"Well, I'm sure I wish it would come off,\" and of course\r\ninstantly, \"slick as butter,\" as he later pointed out, off it came.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Lord Yalding.\r\n\r\n\"And I believe now he thinks I kept it on on purpose,\" said Gerald\r\nafterwards when, at ease on the leads at home, they talked the whole\r\nthing out over a tin of preserved pineapple and a bottle of gingerbeer\r\napiece. \"There's no pleasing some people. He wasn't in such a fiery\r\nhurry to order that wagonette after he found that Mademoiselle meant to\r\ngo when we did. But I liked him better when he was a humble bailiff.\r\nTake him for all in all, he does not look as if we should like him\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't know what's the matter with him,\" said Kathleen, leaning\r\nback against the tiled roof; \"it's really the magic--it's like sickening\r\nwith measles. Don't you remember how cross Mabel was at first about the\r\ninvisibleness?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather!\" said Jimmy.\r\n\r\n\"It's partly that,\" said Gerald, trying to be fair, \"and partly it's the\r\nbeing in love. It always makes people like idiots--a chap at school told\r\nme. His sister was like that--quite rotten, you know. And she used to be\r\nquite a decent sort before she was engaged.\"\r\n\r\nAt tea and at supper Mademoiselle was radiant--as attractive as a lady\r\non a Christmas card, as merry as a marmoset, and as kind as you would\r\nalways be yourself if you could take the trouble. At breakfast, an equal\r\nradiance, kindness, attraction, merriment. Then Lord Yalding came to see\r\nher. The meeting took place in the drawing-room: the children with deep\r\ndiscreetness remained shut in the schoolroom till Gerald, going up to\r\nhis room for a pencil, surprised Eliza with her ear glued to the\r\ndrawing-room key-hole.\r\n\r\nAfter that Gerald sat on the top stair with a book. He could not hear\r\nany of the conversation in the drawing-room, but he could command a view\r\nof the door, and in this way be certain that no one else heard any of\r\nit. Thus it was that when the drawing-room door opened Gerald was in a\r\nposition to see Lord Yalding come out. \"Our young hero,\" as he said\r\nlater, \"coughed with infinite tact to show that he was there,\" but Lord\r\nYalding did not seem to notice. He walked in a blind sort of way to the\r\nhat-stand, fumbled clumsily with the umbrellas and mackintoshes, found\r\nhis straw hat and looked at it gloomily, crammed it on his head and went\r\nout, banging the door behind him in the most reckless way.\r\n\r\nHe left the drawing-room door open, and Gerald, though he had purposely\r\nput himself in a position where one could hear nothing from the\r\ndrawing-room when the door was shut, could hear something quite plainly\r\nnow that the door was open. That something, he noticed with deep\r\ndistress and disgust, was the sound of sobs and sniffs. Mademoiselle\r\nwas quite certainly crying.\r\n\r\n\"Jimminy!\" he remarked to himself, \"they haven't lost much time. Fancy\r\ntheir beginning to quarrel _already_! I hope I'll never have to be\r\nanybody's lover.\"\r\n\r\nBut this was no time to brood on the terrors of his own future. Eliza\r\nmight at any time occur. She would not for a moment hesitate to go\r\nthrough that open door, and push herself into the very secret sacred\r\nheart of Mademoiselle's grief. It seemed to Gerald better that he should\r\nbe the one to do this. So he went softly down the worn green Dutch\r\ncarpet of the stairs and into the drawing-room, shutting the door softly\r\nand securely behind him.\r\n\r\n= = = = =\r\n\r\n\"It is all over,\" Mademoiselle was saying, her face buried in the beady\r\narum-lilies on a red ground worked for a cushion cover by a former\r\npupil: \"he will not marry me!\"\r\n\r\nDo not ask me how Gerald had gained the lady's confidence. He had, as I\r\nthink I said almost at the beginning, very pretty ways with grown-ups,\r\nwhen he chose. Anyway, he was holding her hand, almost as affectionately\r\nas if she had been his mother with a headache, and saying \"Don't!\" and\r\n\"Don't cry!\" and \"It'll be all right, you see if it isn't\" in the most\r\ncomforting way you can imagine, varying the treatment with gentle thumps\r\non the back and entreaties to her to tell him all about it.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't mere curiosity, as you might think. The entreaties were\r\nprompted by Gerald's growing certainty that whatever was the matter was\r\nsomehow the fault of that ring. And in this Gerald was (\"once more,\" as\r\nhe told himself) right.\r\n\r\nThe tale, as told by Mademoiselle, was certainly an unusual one. Lord\r\nYalding, last night after dinner, had walked in the park \"to think\r\nof----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Gerald; \"and he had the ring on. And he saw----\"\r\n\r\n\"He saw the monuments become alive,\" sobbed Mademoiselle: \"his brain was\r\ntroubled by the ridiculous accounts of fairies that you tell him. He\r\nsees Apollon and Aphrodite alive on their marble. He remembers him of\r\nyour story. He wish himself a statue. Then he becomes mad--imagines to\r\nhimself that your story of the island is true, plunges in the lake,\r\nswims among the beasts of the Ark of Noe, feeds with gods on an island.\r\nAt dawn the madness become less. He think the Pantheon vanish. But him,\r\nno--he thinks himself statue, hiding from gardeners in his garden till\r\nnine less a quarter. Then he thinks to wish himself no more a statue and\r\nperceives that he is flesh and blood. A bad dream, but he has lost the\r\nhead with the tales you tell. He say it is no dream but he is\r\nfool--mad--how you say? And a mad man must not marry. There is no hope.\r\nI am at despair! And the life is vain!\"\r\n\r\n\"There _is_,\" said Gerald earnestly. \"I assure you there is--hope, I\r\nmean. And life's as right as rain really. And there's nothing to despair\r\nabout. He's _not_ mad, and it's _not_ a dream. It's magic. It really and\r\ntruly is.\"\r\n\r\n\"The magic exists not,\" Mademoiselle moaned; \"it is that he is mad. It\r\nis the joy to re-see me after so many days. Oh, la-la-la-la-la!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he talk to the gods?\" Gerald asked gently.\r\n\r\n\"It is there the most mad of all his ideas. He say that Mercure give him\r\nrendezvous at some temple to-morrow when the moon raise herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" cried Gerald, \"righto! Dear nice, kind, pretty Mademoiselle\r\nRapunzel, don't be a silly little duffer\"--he lost himself for a moment\r\namong the consoling endearments he was accustomed to offer to Kathleen\r\nin moments of grief and emotion, but hastily added: \"I mean, do not be a\r\nlady who weeps causelessly. To-morrow he will go to that temple. I will\r\ngo. Thou shalt go--he will go. We will go--you will go--let 'em all go!\r\nAnd, you see, it's going to be absolutely all right. He'll see he isn't\r\nmad, and you'll understand all about everything. Take my handkerchief,\r\nits quite a clean one as it happens; I haven't even unfolded it. Oh! do\r\nstop crying, there's a dear, darling, long-lost lover.\"\r\n\r\nThis flood of eloquence was not without effect. She took his\r\nhandkerchief, sobbed, half smiled, dabbed at her eyes, and said: \"Oh,\r\nnaughty! Is it some trick you play him, like the ghost?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't explain,\" said Gerald, \"but I give you my word of honour--you\r\nknow what an Englishman's word of honour is, don't you? even if you\r\n_are_ French--that everything is going to be exactly what you wish. I've\r\nnever told you a lie. Believe me!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is curious,\" said she, drying her eyes, \"but I do.\" And once again,\r\nso suddenly that he could not have resisted, she kissed him. I think,\r\nhowever, that in this her hour of sorrow he would have thought it mean\r\nto resist.\r\n\r\n\"It pleases her and it doesn't hurt me--much,\" would have been his\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now it is near moonrise. The French governess, half-doubting, half\r\nhoping, but wholly longing to be near Lord Yalding even if he be as mad\r\nas a March hare, and the four children--they have collected Mabel by an\r\nurgent letter-card posted the day before--are going over the dewy grass.\r\nThe moon has not yet risen, but her light is in the sky mixed with the\r\npink and purple of the sunset. The west is heavy with ink-clouds and\r\nrich colour, but the east, where the moon rises, is clear as a\r\nrock-pool.\r\n\r\nThey go across the lawn and through the beech-wood and come at last,\r\nthrough a tangle of underwood and bramble, to a little level tableland\r\nthat rises out of the flat hill-top--one tableland out of another. Here\r\nis the ring of vast rugged stones, one pierced with a curious round\r\nhole, worn smooth at its edges. In the middle of the circle is a great\r\nflat stone, alone, desolate, full of meaning--a stone that is covered\r\nthick with the memory of old faiths and creeds long since forgotten.\r\nSomething dark moves in the circle. The French girl breaks from the\r\nchildren, goes to it, clings to its arm. It is Lord Yalding, and he is\r\ntelling her to go.\r\n\r\n\"Never of the life!\" she cries. \"If you are mad I am mad too, for I\r\nbelieve the tale these children tell. And I am here to be with thee and\r\nsee with thee--whatever the rising moon shall show us.\"\r\n\r\nThe children, holding hands by the flat stone, more moved by the magic\r\nin the girl's voice than by any magic of enchanted rings, listen, trying\r\nnot to listen.\r\n\r\n\"Are you not afraid?\" Lord Yalding is saying.\r\n\r\n\"Afraid? With you?\" she laughs. He put his arm round her. The children\r\nhear her sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Are you afraid,\" he says, \"my darling?\"\r\n\r\nGerald goes across the wide turf ring expressly to say:--\r\n\r\n\"You can't be afraid if you are wearing the ring. And I'm sorry, but we\r\ncan hear every word you say.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughs again. \"It makes nothing,\" she says; \"you know already if we\r\nlove each other.\"\r\n\r\nThen he puts the ring on her finger, and they stand together. The white\r\nof his flannel coat sleeve marks no line on the white of her dress; they\r\nstand as though cut out of one block of marble.\r\n\r\nThen a faint greyness touches the top of that round hole, creeps up the\r\nside. Then the hole is a disc of light--a moonbeam strikes straight\r\nthrough it across the grey green of the circle that the stones mark, and\r\nas the moon rises the moonbeam slants downward. The children have drawn\r\nback till they stand close to the lovers. The moonbeam slants more and\r\nmore; now it touches the far end of the stone, now it draws nearer and\r\nnearer to the middle of it, now at last it touches the very heart and\r\ncentre of that central stone. And then it is as though a spring were\r\ntouched, a fountain of light released. Everything changes. Or, rather,\r\neverything is revealed. There are no more secrets. The plan of the world\r\nseems plain, like an easy sum that one writes in big figures on a\r\nchild's slate. One wonders how one can ever have wondered about\r\nanything. Space is not; every place that one has seen or dreamed of is\r\nhere. Time is not; into this instant is crowded all that one has ever\r\ndone or dreamed of doing. It is a moment, and it is eternity. It is the\r\ncentre of the universe and it is the universe itself. The eternal light\r\nrests on and illuminates the eternal heart of things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNone of the six human beings who saw that moon-rising were ever able to\r\nthink about it as having anything to do with time. Only for one instant\r\ncould that moonray have rested full on the centre of that stone. And yet\r\nthere was time for many happenings.\r\n\r\nFrom that height one could see far out over the quiet park and sleeping\r\ngardens, and through the grey green of them shapes moved, approaching.\r\n\r\nThe great beasts came first, strange forms that were when the world was\r\nnew--gigantic lizards with wings--dragons they lived as in men's\r\nmemories--mammoths, strange vast birds, they crawled up the hill and\r\nranged themselves outside the circle. Then, not from the garden but\r\nfrom very far away, came the stone gods of Egypt and Assyria--bull-bodied,\r\nbird-winged, hawk-headed, cat-headed, all in stone, and all alive and\r\nalert; strange, grotesque figures from the towers of cathedrals--figures\r\nof angels with folded wings, figures of beasts with wings wide spread;\r\nsphinxes; uncouth idols from Southern palm-fringed islands; and, last of\r\nall, the beautiful marble shapes of the gods and goddesses who had held\r\ntheir festival on the lake-island, and bidden Lord Yalding and the\r\nchildren to this meeting.\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken. Each stone shape came gladly and quietly into the\r\ncircle of light and understanding, as children, tired with a long\r\nramble, creep quietly through the open door into the firelit welcome of\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe children had thought to ask many questions. And it had been promised\r\nthat the questions should be answered. Yet now no one spoke a word,\r\nbecause all had come into the circle of the real magic where all things\r\nare understood without speech.\r\n\r\nAfterwards none of them could ever remember at all what had happened.\r\nBut they never forgot that they had been somewhere where everything was\r\neasy and beautiful. And people who can remember even that much are never\r\nquite the same again. And when they came to talk of it next day they\r\nfound that to each some little part of that night's great enlightenment\r\nwas left.\r\n\r\nAll the stone creatures drew closer round the stone--the light where the\r\nmoonbeam struck it seemed to break away in spray such as water makes\r\nwhen it falls from a height. All the crowd was bathed in whiteness. A\r\ndeep hush lay over the vast assembly.\r\n\r\nThen a wave of intention swept over the mighty crowd. All the faces,\r\nbird, beast, Greek statue, Babylonian monster, human child and human\r\nlover, turned upward, the radiant light illumined them and one word\r\nbroke from all.\r\n\r\n\"The light!\" they cried, and the sound of their voice was like the sound\r\nof a great wave; \"the light! the light----\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the light was not any more, and, soft as floating thistle-down,\r\nsleep was laid on the eyes of all but the immortals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe grass was chill and dewy and the clouds had veiled the moon. The\r\nlovers and the children were standing together, all clinging close, not\r\nfor fear, but for love.\r\n\r\n\"I want,\" said the French girl softly, \"to go to the cave on the\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\nVery quietly through the gentle brooding night they went down to the\r\nboat-house, loosed the clanking chain, and dipped oars among the drowned\r\nstars and lilies. They came to the island, and found the steps.\r\n\r\n\"I brought candles,\" said Gerald, \"in case.\"\r\n\r\nSo, lighted by Gerald's candles, they went down into the Hall of Psyche!\r\nand there glowed the light spread from her statue, and all was as the\r\nchildren had seen it before.\r\n\r\nIt is the Hall of Granted Wishes.\r\n\r\n\"The ring,\" said Lord Yalding.\r\n\r\n\"The ring,\" said his lover, \"is the magic ring given long ago to a\r\nmortal, and it is what you say it is. It was given to your ancestor by a\r\nlady of my house that he might build her a garden and a house like her\r\nown palace and garden in her own land. So that this place is built\r\npartly by his love and partly by that magic. She never lived to see it;\r\nthat was the price of the magic.\"\r\n\r\nIt must have been English that she spoke, for otherwise how could the\r\nchildren have understood her? Yet the words were not like Mademoiselle's\r\nway of speaking.\r\n\r\n\"Except from children,\" her voice went on, \"the ring exacts a payment.\r\nYou paid for me, when I came by your wish, by this terror of madness\r\nthat you have since known. Only one wish is free.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that wish is----?\"\r\n\r\n\"The last,\" she said. \"Shall I wish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--wish,\" they said, all of them.\r\n\r\n\"I wish, then,\" said Lord Yalding's lover, \"that all the magic this ring\r\nhas wrought may be undone, and that the ring itself may be no more and\r\nno less than a charm to bind thee and me together for evermore.\"\r\n\r\nShe ceased. And as she ceased the enchanted light died away, the windows\r\nof granted wishes went out, like magic-lantern pictures. Gerald's candle\r\nfaintly lighted a rudely arched cave, and where Psyche's statue had been\r\nwas a stone with something carved on it.\r\n\r\nGerald held the light low.\r\n\r\n\"It is her grave,\" the girl said.\r\n\r\n= = = = =\r\n\r\nNext day no one could remember anything at all exactly. But a good many\r\nthings were changed. There was no ring but the plain gold ring that\r\nMademoiselle found clasped in her hand when she woke in her own bed in\r\nthe morning. More than half the jewels in the panelled room were gone,\r\nand those that remained had no panelling to cover them; they just lay\r\nbare on the velvet-covered shelves. There was no passage at the back of\r\nthe Temple of Flora. Quite a lot of the secret passages and hidden rooms\r\nhad disappeared. And there were not nearly so many statues in the garden\r\nas everyone had supposed. And large pieces of the castle were missing\r\nand had to be replaced at great expense. From which we may conclude that\r\nLord Yalding's ancestor had used the ring a good deal to help him in his\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nHowever, the jewels that were left were quite enough to pay for\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nThe suddenness with which all the ring-magic was undone was such a shock\r\nto everyone concerned that they now almost doubt that any magic ever\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nBut it is certain that Lord Yalding married the French governess and\r\nthat a plain gold ring was used in the ceremony, and this, if you come\r\nto think of it, could be no other than the magic ring, turned, by that\r\nlast wish, into a charm to keep him and his wife together for ever.\r\n\r\nAlso, if all this story is nonsense and a make-up--if Gerald and Jimmy\r\nand Kathleen and Mabel have merely imposed on my trusting nature by a\r\npack of unlikely inventions, how do you account for the paragraph which\r\nappeared in the evening papers the day after the magic of the\r\nmoon-rising?\r\n\r\n          \"MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF A WELL-KNOWN\r\n                          CITY MAN,\"\r\n\r\nit said, and then went on to say how a gentleman, well known and much\r\nrespected in financial circles, had vanished, leaving no trace.\r\n\r\n          \"Mr. U. W. Ugli,\" the papers continued, \"had\r\n          remained late, working at his office as was his\r\n          occasional habit. The office door was found\r\n          locked, and on its being broken open the clothes\r\n          of the unfortunate gentleman were found in a heap\r\n          on the floor, together with an umbrella, a walking\r\n          stick, a golf club, and, curiously enough, a\r\n          feather brush, such as housemaids use for dusting.\r\n          Of his body, however, there was no trace. The\r\n          police are stated to have a clue.\"\r\n\r\nIf they have, they have kept it to themselves. But I do not think they\r\ncan have a clue, because, of course, that respected gentleman was the\r\nUgly-Wugly who became real when, in search of a really good hotel, he\r\ngot into the Hall of Granted Wishes. And if none of this story ever\r\nhappened, how is it that those four children are such friends with Lord\r\nand Lady Yalding, and stay at The Towers almost every holidays?\r\n\r\nIt is all very well for all of them to pretend that the whole of this\r\nstory is my own invention: facts are facts, and you can't explain them\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n    UNWIN BROTHERS, LIMITED, THE GRESHAM PRESS, WOKING AND LONDON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nVaried hyphenation was retained, for example: hearthrug and hearth-rug.\r\nThis book used two different styles of break in the text.
