III. p. 354-393, and VOL. IV. p. 257-354),\r\nwhich were drawn up by the Authors jointly many years ago, before any\r\nother portion of the work was composed, but which have, especially\r\nthe former, required considerable alterations and additions in\r\nconsequence of subsequent observations and information.\r\n\r\nIt will not be amiss here to state, in order to obviate any charge\r\nof inconsistency in the possible event of Mr. KIRBY'S adverting in\r\nany other work to this subject, that though on every material point\r\nthe authors have agreed in opinion, their views of the _theory of\r\ninstinct_ do not precisely accord. That given in the second and\r\nfourth volumes is from the pen of Mr. SPENCE.\r\n\r\nIt was originally intended, as mentioned in the Preface, to have given\r\na complete list of Entomological works, of which a large portion was\r\ndrawn up; but the great length to which more important matters have\r\nextended, has rendered necessary the intire omission of this list,--an\r\nomission in some degree compensated by the catalogue of _Authors\r\nquoted_, which comprises most of the standard Entomological works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ERRATA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Page.

This may seem a strange question after such\r\ncopious details as have been given in my former Letters of their\r\nhistory and economy, in which it appears to have been taken for\r\ngranted that you can _answer_ this question. Yet in the scientific\r\nroad which you are now about to enter, to be able to define these\r\ncreatures technically is an important first step which calls for\r\nattention. You know already that a butterfly is an insect--that\r\na fly, a beetle, a grasshopper, a bug, a bee, a louse, and flea,\r\nare insects--that a spider also and centipede go under that name;\r\nand this knowledge, which every child likewise possesses, was\r\nsufficient for comprehending the subjects upon which I have hitherto\r\nwritten. But now that we are about to take a nearer view of them--to\r\ninvestigate their anatomical and physiological characters more\r\nclosely--these vague and popular ideas are insufficient. In common\r\nlanguage, not only the tribes above mentioned, but most _small_\r\nanimals--as worms, slugs, leeches, and many similar creatures, are\r\nknown by the name of _insects_. Such latitude, however, cannot be\r\nadmitted in a scientific view of the subject, in which the class\r\nof insects is distinguished from these animals just as strictly as\r\nbeasts from birds, and birds from reptiles and amphibia, and these\r\nagain from fishes. Not, indeed, that the just limits of the class\r\nhave always been clearly understood and marked out. Even when our\r\ncorrespondence first commenced, animals were regarded as belonging\r\nto it, which since their internal organization has been more fully\r\nexplained, are properly separated from it. But it is now agreed on\r\nall hands, that an earthworm, a leech, or a slug, is not an insect;\r\nand a Naturalist seems almost as much inclined to smile at those who\r\nconfound them, as Captain Cook at the islanders who confessed their\r\nentire ignorance of the nature of cows and horses, but gave him to\r\nunderstand that they knew his sheep and goats to be birds.\r\n\r\nYou will better comprehend the subsequent definition of the\r\nterm _Insect_, after attending to a slight sketch of the chief\r\nclassifications of the animal kingdom, more especially of the\r\ncreatures in question, that have been proposed. That of Aristotle\r\nstands first. He divides animals into two grand sections,\r\ncorresponding with the _Vertebrata_ and _Invertebrata_ of modern\r\nZoologists: those, namely, that have blood, and those that have it\r\nnot[1]:--by this it appears that he only regarded _red_ blood as\r\nreal blood; and probably did not suspect that there was a true\r\ncirculation in his _Mollusca_ and other white-blooded animals. His\r\n_Enaima_, or animals that have blood, he divides into _Quadrupeds_,\r\n_Birds_, _Fishes_, _Cetacea_, and _Apods_ or reptiles; though\r\nhe includes the latter, where they have four legs, amongst the\r\nquadrupeds[2]; and his _Anaima_, or animals without blood, into\r\n_Malachia_, _Malacostraca_, _Ostracoderma_, and _Entoma_. The\r\nfirst of these, the _Malachia_, he defines as animals that are\r\nexternally fleshy and internally solid, like the _Enaima_; and\r\nhe gives the _Sepia_ as the type of this class, which answers to\r\nthe _Cephalopoda_ of the moderns. The next, the _Malacostraca_,\r\nsynonymous with the _Crustacea_ of Cuvier and Lamarck, are those,\r\nhe says, which have their solid part without and the fleshy within,\r\nand whose shell will not break, but splits, upon collision[3]. The\r\n_Ostracoderma_, corresponding with the _Testacea_ of Linné, he also\r\ndefines as having their fleshy substance within, and the solid\r\nwithout; but whose shell, as to its fracture, reverses the character\r\nof the _Malacostraca_. He defines his last class _Entoma_, in Latin\r\n_Insecta_, with which we are principally concerned, as animals whose\r\nbody is distinguished by _incisures_, either on its upper or under\r\nside, or on both, and has no solid or fleshy substance separate, but\r\nsomething intermediate, their body being equally hard both within and\r\nwithout[4]. This definition would include the _Annelida_ and most\r\nother _Vermes_ of Linné, except the _Testacea_, which accordingly\r\nwere considered as insects by those Zoologists that intervened\r\nbetween Aristotle and the latter author. The Stagyrite, however, in\r\nanother place, has expressly excluded all _apods_[5]. From other\r\npassages in his works, it appears that he regarded the _Vermes_, &c.\r\neither as _larvæ_, or as produced spontaneously and not _ex ovo_[6].\r\n\r\nThis definition of an insect, though partly founded on misconception,\r\nas well as his primary division of animals in general, is by no means\r\ncontemptible. If you look at a bee or a fly, you will observe at first\r\nsight that its body is _insected_, being divided as it were into three\r\nprincipal pieces--head, trunk, and abdomen[7]; and if you examine\r\nit more narrowly, you will find that the two last of these parts,\r\nespecially the abdomen, are further subdivided. And this character\r\nof _insection_, or division into segments, more or less present in\r\nalmost every insect[8], is not to be found (with the exception of the\r\n_Crustacea_, which Aristotle distinguishes by the nature of their\r\nintegument and its contents) in any of the other classes into which he\r\ndivided animals without blood. It was on account of this most obvious\r\nof their characters, that these little creatures were in Greek named\r\n_Entoma_, and in Latin _Insecta_; and from the former word, as you\r\nknow, our favourite science takes the name of _Entomology_.\r\n\r\nPliny adhering to the definition of Aristotle, as far as it relates\r\nto the _insection_ of the animals we are speaking of, expressly\r\nincludes _Apods_, as well as _Aptera_, amongst them[9]; and in\r\nthis was followed, without any attempt at improvement, by all the\r\nentomological writers that intervened between him and the great\r\nAristotle of the moderns, Linné.\r\n\r\nThis illustrious naturalist, aware of the incorrectness of the\r\nprimary divisions of the animal kingdom founded upon the presence or\r\nabsence of blood, establishes his system upon the structure of the\r\nheart, and upon the temperature and colour of the circulating fluid.\r\nHe divided animals into two great _sections_ or _sub-kingdoms_, each\r\ncomprising two _classes_. His _first_ section included those having\r\na heart with _two_ ventricles, _two_ auricles, and _warm_ and red\r\nblood, viz. the _Mammalia_ or beasts, and the _Aves_ or birds. His\r\n_second_, those having a heart with _one_ ventricle, _one_ auricle,\r\nand _cold_ and red blood, namely, the classes _Amphibia_, which\r\nincluded reptiles, serpents, &c. and _Pisces_ or fish. His _third_,\r\nthose having a heart with _one_ ventricle and _no_ auricle, and _cold\r\nwhite_ sanies in the place of blood, namely, his classes _Insecta_ et\r\n_Vermes_, including the _Invertebrate_ animals of Lamarck. Thus the\r\nfirst of Aristotle's great divisions he increased by the addition of\r\na new and very distinct class, the _Amphibia_, by which some ground\r\nwas gained in the science; but as much was lost by his compressing\r\nthe four classes of which the last consisted into two, by which\r\nthe natural classes of _Cephalopoda_ and _Crustacea_ merged under\r\n_Insecta_ and _Vermes_. Linné was not aware of the extraordinary\r\nfact, that the _Cephalopoda_ have three hearts; and that though the\r\n_Crustacea_ and _Arachnida_ have a circulation, _Insects_ have none,\r\nor he would never have taken this retrograde step.\r\n\r\nIndeed Linné's definition of an _Insect_ is, in many most material\r\npoints, inapplicable, not only to the _Crustacea_, but to many other\r\nanimals included under that denomination. This will appear evident\r\nfrom a very slight examination. Thus it runs: \"_Polypod animalcula,\r\nbreathing by lateral spiracles, armed every where with an osseous\r\nskin, whose head is furnished with movable sensitive antennæ_[10].\"\r\nNow of this definition only the first member can be applied to the\r\nwhole class which it is meant to designate; for the entire genus\r\n_Cancer_ L., which, with some others, forms the class _Crustacea_ of\r\nthe moderns, does not respire by _spiracles_ at all, but by _gills_;\r\nand the same in some degree may be said of spiders, scorpions, &c.\r\nWith the last member of the definition Linné himself must have been\r\naware that a large number of what he conceived to be insects were at\r\nvariance, as mites, spiders, and many other of his apterous tribes:\r\nthough from some very recent observations of M. Latreille[11],\r\nthere seems some ground for thinking, that in these the antennæ\r\nare represented by the mandibles, palpi, &c.[12], and to the soft\r\nflexible, coriaceous or membranous skin of a vast number of insects,\r\nthe term _cutis ossea_ is by no means applicable.\r\n\r\nEvident as these incongruities are, when the Herculean task which\r\nLinné imposed upon himself, and the vastness and variety of his\r\nlabours, are considered, they become very venial. Indeed, unless he\r\nhad divided his class _Insecta_ into two or more, it was impossible\r\nto define it intelligibly to ordinary readers, otherwise than nearly\r\nin the terms which he actually employed; and these characters,\r\nrestricted and amended by qualifying clauses, are still those to\r\nwhich recurrence must be had in a popular definition of the class,\r\nwhen separated as it ought to be from the _Crustacea_ and _Arachnida_.\r\n\r\nPennant, Brisson, and other zoologists, who, attending to _nature_\r\nrather than _system_, saw the impropriety of uniting a crab or a\r\nlobster in the same class with a bee or a beetle, long since assigned\r\nthe _Crustacea_ their ancient distinct rank. \"But these changes,\"\r\nas Latreille observes[13], \"being only founded upon _external_\r\ncharacters, might be deemed arbitrary; and to fix our opinion, it was\r\nnecessary to have recourse to a decisive authority--the _internal_\r\nand comparative organization of these animals.\" It results from the\r\nobservations of the most profound comparative anatomist of our age,\r\nM. Cuvier, that the _Crustacea_ and _Arachnida_ differ from insects\r\nproperly so called, and particularly from those that are furnished\r\nwith wings, in having a complete system of circulation, a different\r\nmode of respiration, and that they have a more perfect organization.\r\nInfluenced by these motives, both Cuvier and Lamarck have considered\r\nthem as forming two classes separate from insects. Treviranus, led by\r\nconsiderations founded on the organs of circulation, of respiration,\r\nand of generation, is of opinion that spiders and scorpions ought\r\nto form one class with the _Crustacea_: he observes, however, that\r\nthe nervous system of all three is very dissimilar; and that in an\r\narrangement founded on this circumstance, the organs of motion, and\r\nthe external shape, even spiders and scorpions must be placed in\r\ndifferent classes[14].\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed with regard to the _Arachnida_ of the French\r\nschool, that the class as laid down by them includes several\r\nanimals that have no circulation, and breathe by _tracheæ_, of\r\nwhich description are the mites (_Acarus_ L.), and the harvest-men\r\n(_Phalangium_ L.) &c.; and therefore it has been divided into two\r\norders, _Pulmonaria_ and _Tracheana_; but if the definition from\r\nthe internal organization be adhered to, the latter should either\r\nremain with the class _Insecta_, or form a new one by themselves. Yet\r\nthe animals that compose the _Trachean_ order of _Arachnida_, their\r\nexternal form considered, are certainly much more nearly related to\r\nthe spiders and scorpions than to any members of the class _Insecta_\r\nat present known. This circumstance, perhaps, may seem to throw some\r\ndoubt upon the modern system of classification.\r\n\r\nI must further observe, that the assertion of Treviranus, which appears\r\nto intimate that the respiration of the _pulmonary Arachnida_ is the\r\nsame with that of the _Crustacea_, is not quite correct, since in\r\nthe latter the _branchiæ_ or gills are _external_, and in the former\r\n_internal_, the air entering by spiracles before it acts upon them[15].\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss in this place to lay before you the principal\r\npoints in which the _Crustacea_ and _Arachnida_ agree with _Insecta_,\r\nand also those in which they differ.\r\n\r\nThe _Crustacea_ agree with _Insecta_ in having a body divided into\r\nsegments, furnished with jointed legs, compound eyes, and antennæ.\r\nTheir nervous system also is not materially different, and they\r\nare both oviparous. They differ from them in having the greater\r\ninsections of the body less strongly marked; in the greater number\r\nof legs on the trunk, the anterior ones performing the office of\r\nmaxillæ: in their eyes usually on a moveable footstalk: their\r\npalpigerous mandibles; and their four antennæ at least in the great\r\nmajority. But the principal difference consists in the internal\r\norganization and the fountains of vitality; for the _Crustacea_ have\r\na double circulation, the fountain of which is a heart in the middle\r\nof their thorax[16]. They have too a kind of gizzard and liver,\r\nat least the _Decapods_[17], and their respiration is by gills.\r\nGenuine insects terminate their existence after they have laid their\r\neggs[18]; but the _Crustacea_ live longer, and lay more than once.\r\n\r\nThe _Arachnida_ will be found to differ from insects more widely than\r\neven the _Crustacea_. They agree in their jointed legs and palpi;\r\nimmoveable eyes; and in being covered with a coriaceous or corneous\r\nintegument: but they differ in having a system of circulation;\r\ngills instead of tracheæ; their organs of generation double; and\r\nthe females lay more than once in their lives. Their head also is\r\nnot distinct from the trunk as in insects; they have no compound\r\neyes; and their antennæ, if we admit the opinion on this head of MM.\r\nLatreille and Treviranus, that they have representatives of these\r\norgans, differ totally in structure, situation, and use, from those\r\nof the great body of insects. In the _Araneidæ_ or Spiders, their\r\nbody seems to have no segments or incisure but that which separates\r\nthe abdomen from the trunk; and in the _Scorpionidæ_ they are\r\nobservable only in the abdomen. Other particulars might be enumerated\r\nin which these two classes differ from insects; but these will be\r\nsufficient to convince you that Aristotle and MM. Cuvier and Lamarck\r\nwere justified in separating them.\r\n\r\nThe two last-mentioned authors made further improvements in Zoology.\r\nThe latter, from the consideration of the general structure of animals,\r\nperceiving that Aristotle's _Enaima_ were distinguished from his\r\n_Anaima_, by being built as it were upon a vertebral column, very\r\njudiciously changed the denomination, which was indeed improper, of\r\n\"_The Philosopher's_\" two sub-kingdoms, into that of _Vertebrata_\r\nor animals that have a vertebral column, and _Invertebrata_ or those\r\nthat have no vertebral column. These he distributes into three primary\r\ndivisions according to their supposed degrees of _intelligence_--Thus:\r\n\r\n    * _Apathetic Animals._         1.

MAMMALIA.[19]\r\n\r\nProfiting by the light afforded by the Aristotelian system, this\r\neminent zoologist improved, we see, upon that of Linné, by resolving\r\nhis _Insecta_ into three classes, and his _Vermes_ into seven,\r\ninterposing the Linnean _Insecta_ between the four first and three\r\nlast, in which he was not so happy, since as to _sense_ insects should\r\ncertainly occupy the place he has here assigned to the _Mollusca_.\r\n\r\nIn the work from which I have taken this statement of Lamarck's\r\nsystem, that acute writer has given a sketch of another method of\r\narrangement, in which he has made the first deviation from the beaten\r\ntrack of an unbroken and unbranching series. In the Supplement to\r\nthe first volume, he has distributed the _Invertebrata_ in a double\r\nsubramose series--one consisting of _articulate_, and the other of\r\n_inarticulate_ animals[20].\r\n\r\nUpon Lamarck's system, most of the modern ones, with some variation,\r\nare founded. There is one, however, by a learned countryman of ours,\r\nthat is more unique, _sui generis_, and I may add profound, than any\r\nthat has yet appeared. I am speaking of that, you will perceive, of\r\nwhich our friend Mr. Wm. MacLeay has given a detailed statement in\r\nhis _Horæ Entomologicæ_. In this he goes even far beyond what Lamarck\r\nhas attempted in the above sketch, and substantiates his claim to be\r\nconsidered as one of those original thinkers, _rari nantes in gurgite\r\nvasto_, that do not appear every day. The following are the principal\r\nbases of his system.\r\n\r\n1. That all natural groups, whether kingdoms or any subdivision of\r\nthem, return into themselves; a distribution which he expresses by\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\n2. That each of these circles is formed precisely of _five_ groups,\r\neach of which is resolvable into five other smaller groups, and so on\r\ntill you reach the extreme term of such division.\r\n\r\n3. That proximate circles or larger groups are connected by the\r\nintervention of lesser groups, which he denominates _osculant_.\r\n\r\n4. That there are relations of analogy between the corresponding\r\npoints of contiguous circles.\r\n\r\nThis system he has represented by tables of circles inscribed with\r\nthe five primary divisions of each group. His first table exhibits a\r\ngeneral view of organized matter as distributed in the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms--Thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOur learned author here divides the animal kingdom into what may be\r\ndenominated five sub-kingdoms or provinces, in three of which (with\r\nthe exception of the _Crustacea_ and _Arachnida_ belonging to his\r\n_Annulosa_) no circulation of blood is visible, but which obtains in\r\nthe rest. These he names--\r\n\r\n1. ACRITA, consisting of the _Infusory Animals_, the _Polypi_, the\r\n_Corallines_, the _Tæniæ_, and the least organized of the _Intestinal\r\nWorms_.\r\n\r\n2. RADIATA, including the _Jelly-fish_, _Star-fish_, _Echini_, and\r\nsome others.\r\n\r\n3. ANNULOSA, consisting of _Insecta_, _Arachnida_, and _Crustacea_.\r\n\r\n4. VERTEBRATA, consisting of _Beasts_, _Birds_, _Reptiles_,\r\n_Amphibia_, and _Fishes_.\r\n\r\n5. MOLLUSCA, including the numerous tribes of _shell-fish_,\r\n_land-shells_, _slugs_, &c., which, from their mucous or gelatinous\r\nsubstance, from their nervous system and the imperfection of their\r\nsenses, return again to the _Acrita_, though connected with the\r\n_Vertebrata_ by having a heart and circulation.\r\n\r\nHis next set of circles shows the sub-division of these five\r\nsub-kingdoms into classes--Thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn this scheme the _osculant_ classes are those placed between the\r\ncircles. In the _Mollusca_ circle two classes are still wanting\r\nto complete the quinary arrangement of that sub-kingdom. I am not\r\nsufficiently conversant with the details of the animal kingdom\r\nat large to hazard any decided opinion upon Mr. MacLeay's whole\r\nsystem, or to ascertain whether all these classes are sufficiently\r\ndistinct[21]. My sentiments with regard to those of the _Annulosa_ I\r\nshall state to you hereafter.\r\n\r\nUpon a future occasion I shall consider more at large the station\r\nto which insects seem entitled in a system of invertebrate animals,\r\nwhich will not accord exactly with that assigned by MM. Cuvier and\r\nLamarck. But I am now in a field in which I have no intention to\r\nexpatiate further, than as it is connected with the subject of the\r\npresent letter. I shall therefore confine myself in what I have\r\nmore to say to the definitions of _Insecta_ that have been given by\r\nmodern authors, beginning with that of the zoologist last mentioned.\r\nInsects form a part of his _second_ group, which he terms _sensitive_\r\nanimals (_animaux sensibles_), which group he thus defines: \"_They\r\nare sentient, but obtain from their sensations only perceptions of\r\nobjects--a kind of simple ideas which they cannot combine to obtain\r\ncomplex ones._ Charact. _No vertebral column; a brain, and most\r\ncommonly an elongated medullary mass; some distinct senses; the\r\norgans of movement attached under the skin: form symmetrical, by\r\nparts, in pairs_[22].\" This division of animals, from the kind and\r\ndegree of sense and intelligence that they possess, seems rather\r\nfanciful than founded in nature, since many insects show a greater\r\nportion of them than many vertebrate animals. Compare in this\r\nrespect a _bee_ with a _tortoise_[23]. Lamarck divides his group\r\nof _animaux sensibles_ into two sections, namely, _Articulated_\r\nanimals, exhibiting segments or articulations in all or some of their\r\nparts; and _Inarticulatcd_ animals, exhibiting neither segments\r\nnor articulations in any of their parts. _Insecta_, _Arachnida_,\r\nand _Crustacea_, belong to the first of these sections, which he\r\ndefines as \"_those whose body is divided into segments, and which are\r\nfurnished with jointed legs bent at the articulations_[24].\" INSECTA\r\nhe defines--\"_Articulate animals, undergoing various metamorphoses,\r\nor acquiring new kinds of parts--having, in their perfect state,\r\nsix feet, two antennæ, two compound eyes, and a corneous skin. The\r\nmajority acquiring wings. Respiration by spiracles_ (stigmates), _and\r\ntwo vascular opposite chords, divided by plexus, and constituting\r\naeriferous tracheæ, which extend every where. A small brain at the\r\nanterior extremity of a longitudinal knotty marrow, with nerves. No\r\nsystem of circulation, no conglomerate glands. Generation oviparous:\r\ntwo distinct sexes. A single sexual union in the whole course of\r\nlife_[25].\" ARACHNIDA he defines--\"_Oviparous animals, having at\r\nall times jointed legs, undergoing no metamorphosis, and never\r\nacquiring new kinds of parts. Respiration tracheal or branchial: the\r\nopenings for the entrance of the air spiraculiform (stigmatiformes).\r\nA heart and circulation beginning in many. The majority couple\r\noften in the course of life_[26].\" I shall next add his definition\r\nof CRUSTACEA: \"_Oviparous, articulated, apterous animals, with a\r\ncrustaceous integument more or less solid, having jointed legs; eyes\r\neither pedunculate or sessile, and most commonly four antennæ, with a\r\nmaxilliferous mouth seldom rostriform; maxillæ in many pairs placed\r\none over the other; scarcely any under-lip; no spiraculiform openings\r\nfor respiration; five or seven pair of legs; a longitudinal knotty\r\nmarrow terminated anteriorly by a small brain. A heart and vessels\r\nfor circulation. Respiration branchial with external branchiæ,\r\nsometimes hid under the sides of the shell of the thorax, or shut\r\nin prominent parts; sometimes uncovered, and in general adhering to\r\nparticular legs or to the tail. Each sex usually double_[27].\"\r\n\r\nI have given Lamarck's definitions of these three classes, all\r\nconsidered as _Insecta_ by Linné, that by comparing them together\r\nyou may be better enabled to appreciate the system of this author.\r\nOn looking over the characters of the _Arachnida_ as here given,\r\nyou will see at once that it consists of heterogeneous animals--for\r\nin fact he includes in this class not only the _Trachean Arachnida_\r\nof Latreille, but the _Ametabolia_ of Dr. Leach, or the _Hexapod_\r\nAptera, and the _Myriapoda_.\r\n\r\nI shall next copy for you Latreille's latest definition of _Insecta_\r\nand _Arachnida_.\r\n\r\n\"INSECTA: _A single dorsal vessel representing the heart: two\r\ntrunks of tracheæ running the whole length of the body, and opening\r\nexternally by numerous spiracles; two antennæ; very often upper\r\nappendages for flight, indicating the metamorphosis to which the\r\nanimal is subject when young; legs most commonly reduced to\r\nsix._ ARACHNIDA: _Distinguished from_ Crustacea _by having their\r\nrespiratory organs always internal, opening on the sides of the\r\nabdomen or thorax to receive the respirable fluid. Sometimes these\r\norgans perform the office of lungs, and then the circulation takes\r\nplace by means of a dorsal vessel, which sends forth arterial, and\r\nreceives venose branches. Sometimes they are tracheæ or air-vessels,\r\nwhich, as in the class_ Insecta, _replace those of circulation. These\r\nhave only the vestige of a heart, or a dorsal vessel alternately\r\ncontracting and sending forth no branch. The absence of antennæ,\r\nthe reunion of the head with the thorax, a simple trachea but\r\nramified and almost radiating, serve to distinguish these last_\r\nArachnida, _or the most imperfect of insects, which respire only by\r\ntracheæ_[28].\" Under this head he observes--\"Of all these characters,\r\nthe most easy to seize and the most certain would doubtless be,\r\nif there were no mistake in it, that of the absence of antennæ;\r\nbut later and comparative researches, confirmed by analogy, have\r\nconvinced me, that these organs, under particular modifications it\r\nis true, and which have misled the attention of naturalists, do\r\nexist[29]:\" and he supposes, from the situation and direction of\r\nthe _mandibles_ of the _Arachnida_, corresponding with that of the\r\n_intermediate_ pair of _antennæ_ in _Crustacea_, that they really\r\nrepresent the latter organs. If this supposition be admitted, their\r\nuse is wholly changed; the palpi, in fact, executing the functions of\r\nantennæ, which probably induced Treviranus to call them _Fühlhörner_\r\n(_Feelinghorns_). Perhaps these last may be regarded as in some sort\r\nrepresenting the _external_ antennæ of the _Crustacea_? With regard\r\nto _Insecta_, their antennæ seem to disappear in the _Pupiparæ_\r\nLatr., or the genus _Hippobosca_ L.\r\n\r\nThe above definitions of the _Arachnida_ by these two celebrated\r\nauthors, appear to me the reverse of satisfactory. When we are told\r\nof animals included in it, that some breathe by gills and others by\r\ntracheæ, that some have a heart and circulation and others not, we\r\nare immediately struck by the incongruity, and are led to suspect\r\nthat animals differing so widely in the fountains of life ought\r\nnot to be associated in the same class. A learned zoologist of our\r\nown country, Dr. Leach, seems to have made a nearer approach to a\r\nclassification in accordance with the internal organization, by\r\nexcluding from _Arachnida_ the _Acari_ and _Myriapoda_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Sub-kingdom ANNULATA Cuv.\r\n\r\n                       * Gills for respiration.           _Classes._\r\n  _Legs sixteen:_        Antennæ two or four             1 CRUSTACEA.\r\n\r\n                       ** Sacs for respiration.\r\n  _Legs twelve:_         Antennæ none                    3 ARACHNÖIDEA.\r\n\r\n                       *** Tracheæ for respiration.\r\n                           a.

From\r\nthe _Crustacea_ he goes by the genus _Porcellio_ Latr. to\r\n_Iulus_[31], which begins his _Ametabola_: these he connects with\r\nthe _Mandibulata_, by _Nirmus_, which he thinks approaches some of\r\nthe corticarious _Coleoptera_[32]. This class he appears to leave\r\nby the _Trichoptera_ Kirby, and so enters his _Haustellata_ by the\r\n_Lepidoptera_[33], and leaves it again by the _Diptera_ by means of\r\nthe _Pupiparæ_ Latr., especially _Nycteribia_, connecting this class\r\nwith the _Arachnida_, which he enters by the Hexapod _Acari_ L.[34],\r\nand these last he appears to leave by the _Araneidæ_, and to enter\r\nthe _Crustacea_ by the Decapods[35]: thus making good his circle\r\nof classes, or a series of Annulose animals returning into itself.\r\nMr. MacLeay's whole system upon paper appears very harmonious and\r\nconsistent, and bears a most seducing aspect of verisimilitude; but\r\nit has not yet been so thoroughly weighed, discussed, and sifted, as\r\nto justify our adopting it _in toto_ at present: should it, however,\r\nupon an impartial and thorough investigation, come forth from the\r\nfurnace as gold, and be found to correspond with the actual state\r\nof things in nature, my objections, which rest only upon some parts\r\nof his arrangement of _Annulosa_, would soon vanish. Some of those\r\nobjections I will state here, and some will come in better when I\r\ntreat of the Systems of Entomology. My first objection is, that his\r\n_Ametabola_, _Mandibulata_, and _Haustellata_, approach much nearer\r\nto each other than they do to the other two classes of his circle,\r\nor than even these last to each other; so that under this view it\r\nshould primarily consist of _three_ greater groups, resolvable, it\r\nmay be, into five smaller ones. My next objection is, that he has\r\nalso considered the _Trachean_ and _Pulmonary_ Arachnida as forming\r\n_one_ class. Whether an animal breathes by gills or tracheæ, or has\r\na circulation or not, is surely as strong a reason for considering\r\nthose so distinguished as belonging to different classes, as the\r\ntaking of their food by suction or by manducation is, for separating\r\nothers to the full as much or more nearly related as to their\r\nexternal structure. But of this more hereafter. I cannot help, as a\r\nlast objection, lamenting that our learned author has rejected from\r\nhis system a term consecrated from the most remote antiquity, and\r\nwhich, even admitting his arrangement, might have been substituted\r\nfor _Annulosa_, a name borrowed by Scaliger from Albertus Magnus,\r\nneither of whom, in Entomology, is an authority to weigh against\r\nAristotle, from whom we derive the term _Insecta_, in Greek Εντομα.\r\n\r\nAs Fabricius did not alter Linné's _class_ Insecta, but merely broke\r\nup his _orders_ into new ones, which he named classes, I shall give\r\nyou a detail of the alterations he introduced into the science in a\r\nfuture letter.\r\n\r\nHaving stated what my predecessors have done in classification, I\r\nshall next proceed to lay before you my own sentiments as to--_What\r\nis an insect._ Since our correspondence commenced, the _Arachnida_,\r\nprincipally on account of their internal organization, have been\r\nexcluded from bearing that name, carrying with them, as we have seen,\r\nseveral tribes, which as yet have not been discovered to differ\r\nmaterially in that respect from the present _Insecta_: for the sake,\r\ntherefore, of convenience and consistency, that I may, as far as the\r\ncase will admit, adhere to the Horatian maxim\r\n\r\n                        ---- Servetur ad imum\r\n          Qualis ab incepto processerit et sibi constet,\r\n\r\nI shall regard as _Insects_ all those _Annulosa_ that respire by\r\ntracheæ[36] and have no circulation, considering the _Trachean\r\nArachnida_ and the _Myriapoda_ for the present as sub-classes,\r\nthe one bordering upon the _Arachnida_, and the other upon the\r\n_Crustacea_. Some of these I am ready to own seem separated by an\r\ninterval sufficiently wide from the _Hexapods_, which may be regarded\r\nas more peculiarly entitled to the denomination of _Insects_. The\r\nmost striking differences will be found in the coalition of the head\r\nwith the trunk in some (_Phalangidæ_), and the disappearance of the\r\nannulose form of the body in others (_Acarus_ L.), so that the legs\r\nonly are jointed[37]. Yet an approach to such structure may be traced\r\nin some Hexapods; for instance, the coalition of the head and trunk in\r\n_Melophagus_, Latr., and that of the trunk and abdomen in _Sminthurus_,\r\nLatr.[38] The _Myriapoda_ exhibit other remarkable differences; though\r\ntheir head and trunk are distinct, the former antenniferous, and their\r\nbody annulose, the abdomen as well as the trunk is furnished with\r\nlegs, sometimes amounting to hundreds; but even to this a tendency\r\nhas been observed in some Hexapods[39]. If you examine a specimen\r\nof _Machilis polypoda_, an insect related to the common sugar-louse\r\n(_Lepisma saccharina_), you will find that the abdomen is furnished\r\nwith a double series of elastic appendages, which, being instruments\r\nof motion, may be regarded as representing legs. It is worthy of\r\nnotice, that the _Myriapoda_ when first disclosed from the egg have\r\nnever more than _six_ legs[40], and keep acquiring additional pairs\r\nof them and additional segments to their abdomen as they change their\r\nskins: and it is equally remarkable, that many Hexapods are subject to\r\na law in some degree the very reverse of this, having many abdominal\r\nlegs in their first state, and losing them all in their last. The\r\nunion of the head with the trunk in the _Trachean Arachnida_ has\r\nbeen regarded as almost an unanswerable argument, in spite of their\r\ndifferent internal organization, for including them in the same class\r\nwith the _Pulmonary Arachnida_; but the case of _Galeodes_, which,\r\nthough furnished with gills, (as an eminent Russian Entomologist Dr. G.\r\nFischer is reported to have discovered,) implying also a circulation,\r\nand evidently belonging to the last-mentioned class, has nevertheless\r\na distinct thorax consisting of more than one piece, to which are\r\naffixed only six legs[41], proves that even this circumstance possesses\r\nno weight when set against the organization. If it was a difference in\r\nthis respect, that proved the _Crustacea_ classically distinct from\r\n_Insecta_--that likewise was the principal reason for the separation\r\nalso of the _Arachnida_--it seems to follow that it ought also to\r\nfurnish an argument equally cogent for considering the _Trachean\r\nArachnida_, as well as the _Myriapoda_, distinct from the _Pulmonary_.\r\n\r\nAnother difference between the tribes in question is that of their\r\n_metamorphosis_; and this appears to have had great weight with\r\nLamarck, inducing him to include in his _Arachnida_, not only the\r\n_Tracheans_ and _Myriapods_, but even the apterous _Hexapods_, except\r\n_Pulex_, or the _Anoplura_ and _Thysanura_ of modern authors. But the\r\nmetamorphosis alone, unless supported by the internal organization,\r\nwill I think scarcely be deemed a sufficient reason for separating\r\nfrom each other tribes agreeing in that respect, and placing them\r\nwith others with which they disagree. The metamorphosis in some\r\nof the Hexapods (_Lepidoptera_) consists in the loss of legs, the\r\nacquisition of wings, a great change in the oral organs and in the\r\ngeneral form; in others (some _Coleoptera_), in the acquisition only\r\nof wings and a change of shape, the oral organs remaining much the\r\nsame; in others again (_Curculio_ L.), in the acquisition of six legs\r\nand wings and a change of form; in the flea, in the acquisition of\r\nsix legs and a change of form only; in the _Orthoptera_, _Hemiptera_,\r\n&c. in the mere acquisition of wings; in the _Libellulidæ_, in\r\nthe loss of the mask that covers the mouth and the acquisition of\r\nwings; in the _Diptera_, in the acquisition of six legs, wings, a\r\nchange of the oral organs and of the form; in some of the _Octopods_\r\n(_Acarus_ L.), in the acquisition of a pair of legs; and in others\r\n(_Phalangium_ and _Aranea_ L.), solely in a modification of them as\r\nto their proportions; in the _Myriapods_, the alteration that takes\r\nplace in this respect is considerable; a large number of pairs of\r\nlegs is acquired and many additional abdominal segments, and the\r\nproportion which the abdomen bears to the whole insect is quite\r\naltered. In all these cases there is a change more or less, either\r\npartial or general, of the original shape or organs of the animal;\r\nand with regard to their metamorphosis, there is a greater difference\r\nbetween a young and adult _Iulus_ than between a young and adult\r\n_grasshopper_ or _bug_: so that if the metamorphosis, _per se_, be\r\nassumed as a principal regulator of the class, the grasshopper or bug\r\nhave as little claim to belong to it as the _Iulus_.\r\n\r\nM. Lamarck lays considerable stress upon another character--That\r\n_Insecta_ engender only once in the course of their lives, and\r\n_Arachnida_ more than once. But this, if examined, will be found to\r\nbe confined chiefly to the _Pulmonary Arachnida_, the _Tracheans_\r\nfollowing the law of _Insecta_ in this respect[42].\r\n\r\nYou may perhaps object that the bringing of the Trachean _Arachnida_\r\nand the _Myriapoda_ into the class _Insecta_ will render the\r\napproximation of them to a natural arrangement more difficult,\r\nsince it will be impossible at the same time to connect the\r\n_Myriapods_ with the _Crustacea_, and the _Trachean_ with the\r\ngenuine _Arachnida_. I admit the validity of your objection, but\r\nby no arrangement of insects in a simple series can we attain this\r\nobject: the difficulty, however, may perhaps be obviated in this way.\r\nThe distribution of organized matter, to adopt Mr. Wm. MacLeay's\r\nmetaphor[43], begins in a dichotomy, constituting the animal and\r\nvegetable branches of the great tree of nature, and from these two\r\ngreat branches, by means of infinite ramifications, the whole system\r\nis formed, and, what is remarkable, these branches unite again so\r\nas to represent a series returning into itself, a discovery due to\r\nthe patient investigation and acumen of our learned friend just\r\nmentioned. Now, in considering the _Aptera_ order, we find at first\r\nsetting out from the Hexapods, a dichotomy, where the _Anoplura_\r\nLeach branch off on the one side, and the _Thysanura_ Latr. on the\r\nother--the former, by means of the _Pediculidæ_, taking their food\r\nby suction, particularly _Phthirus_ Leach, or the Morpion (in which\r\nthe segments of the trunk and abdomen become indistinct[44]) approach\r\nthe _Octopods_ by the hexapod _Acari_ L.--the latter by _Machilis\r\npolypoda_ tending towards the _Myriapods_. In the Octopod branch a\r\nfurther dichotomy takes place, from which you proceed on one side to\r\nthe _Araneidæ_ in the _Arachnida_, by _Phalangium_, &c.; and in the\r\nother by _Chelifer_, &c. to _Scorpio_. Again, the _Myriapod_ branch\r\nalso divides, going by the _Iulidæ_ to one branch of the _Isopod\r\nCrustacea_, and by the _Scolopendridæ_ to another.\r\n\r\nBut there is another view of this subject before alluded to, which\r\nmay be repeated here, and which seems to prove that the types of\r\nform in one natural group or class are reproduced in another; this\r\nappears to result from the following parallel series:\r\n\r\n  _Neuropterous_      _Aptera._         _Arachnida._    _Crustacea._\r\n    _Larvæ._\r\n\r\n  Psocus             Hexapoda              Galeodes        Larunda.\r\n\r\n  Myrmeleon              _Phalangium_      Aranea         {Decapoda\r\n                                                          {  brachyura.\r\n\r\n                    Octopoda\r\n\r\n  Panorpa?              _Chelifer_         Scorpio        {Decapoda\r\n                                                          {  macroura.\r\n                                                          {  _Thalassina\r\n                                                          {  Scorpio_\r\n                                                          {  especially.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ephemera          Myriapoda              *****          Isopoda.\r\n\r\nNo type representing the _Myriapoda_ has yet been discovered in the\r\n_Arachnida_ class; but I have little doubt of its existence. You will\r\nobserve that the analogies between the larvæ of the _winged_ orders\r\nand the _Aptera_ were first noticed by Mr. W. MacLeay[45]. It is\r\nprobable that these parallel series of representatives of each other\r\nmight be increased, as well as the numbers in the respective columns.\r\n\r\nWhat I have said will, I trust, sufficiently justify me for making\r\nat present no more material alterations in the classification I\r\nlong since proposed to you[46]; I shall, therefore, now proceed\r\nto define the objects I consider as _Insecta_; but I shall first\r\nobserve--that as Latreille considers the _branchiopod Crustacea_\r\nor _Entomostraca_ of Müller as entitled to the denomination of\r\n_Crustaceo-Arachnida_[47]; so his _Trachean Arachnida_ might be\r\ncalled _Arachnida-Insecta_, and his _Myriapoda_, _Crustaceo-Insecta_.\r\n\r\n                      _Sub-kingdom_--ANNULOSA[48].\r\n\r\n                           _Class_--INSECTA.\r\n\r\n        _First Definition--From their_ external _Organization_.\r\n\r\nBODY--divided into Head--Trunk--Abdomen.\r\n\r\n  HEAD.--Principal seat of the organs of sensation.\r\n\r\n    _Organs of sight._ Immoveable eyes, simple or compound, varying\r\n      in number.\r\n\r\n    _Organs of hearing_ uncertain, probably connected with the\r\n      antennæ.\r\n\r\n    _Organ of taste._ Ligula or palate within the mouth, accompanied\r\n      by the _organs of manducation_--a pair of mandibles and maxillæ\r\n      and an upper and lower lip, or their representatives.\r\n\r\n    _Organs of touch._ Principally two jointed antennæ or their\r\n      representatives, and four jointed feelers--two maxillary and\r\n      two labial.\r\n\r\n  TRUNK. Principal seat of the organs of motion.\r\n\r\n    _Organs of walking, running, or jumping._ Six or eight jointed\r\n      thoracic legs, in pairs.\r\n\r\n    _Organs of flight._ Four wings or their representatives, mostly\r\n      with branching nervures containing air-vessels; found in the\r\n      majority of the class.\r\n\r\n    _Organs_ (_external_) _of respiration._ A double set of lateral\r\n      spiracles, some for expiration.\r\n\r\n  ABDOMEN. Principal seat of the organs of generation.\r\n\r\n    _Organs of motion._ In the _Myriapods_ many pairs of acquired\r\n      legs; in the _Thysanura_ elastic ventral or caudal appendages.\r\n\r\n    _Organs of respiration._ A double series of lateral spiracles for\r\n      inspiration in the majority; in some only a single series, and\r\n      in others only a single pair.\r\n\r\n    _Organs of generation_ those common to the _Vertebrata_, but\r\n      retractile within the body, attended usually by various anal\r\n      appendages, particularly a forceps in the males, and an\r\n      ovipositor in the females.\r\n\r\n        _Second Definition--From their_ internal _Organization_.\r\n\r\nSENSATION.\r\n\r\n  _Nervous System._ A small brain usually subbilobed, crowning a\r\n    knotty double medullary chord; nerves proceeding from the brain\r\n    and other ganglions to all parts of the body.\r\n\r\nCIRCULATION.\r\n\r\n  _Heart_ replaced by a simple alternately contracting dorsal vessel\r\n    or pseudocardia, without arteries or veins, but filled with a\r\n    white cold sanies.\r\n\r\nRESPIRATION.\r\n\r\n  _Lungs_ replaced by tracheæ, which receive the air from the\r\n    spiracles, and distribute it by bronchiæ infinitely ramified. #/\r\n\r\nDIGESTION.\r\n\r\n  _Liver and biliary vessels_ in most replaced by from 2 to + 150\r\n    floating hepatic filaments opening into the space between the two\r\n    skins of the intestinal canal below the pylorus.\r\n\r\nGENERATION.\r\n\r\n  _Internal organs. Males_--Vasa deferentia, and vesiculæ seminales,\r\n    and the other ordinary organs. _Females_--Ovary usually\r\n    bipartite, with palmate lobes; genital organs single and mostly\r\n    anal; one sexual union impregnates the female for her life.\r\n\r\n_Development_. In their passage to their adult state, after they\r\nhave left the egg, _insects_ undergo several simultaneous changes of\r\ntheir integument or successive moults, and the majority assume three\r\ndistinct forms, with distinct organs, which appear as rudiments in\r\ntheir second state, and are completely developed in their last.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn defining the _Arachnida_ I shall only mention those particulars in\r\nwhich they differ from _Insectæ_ in their external anatomy.\r\n\r\n                          _Class_--ARACHNIDA.\r\n\r\nBODY.\r\n\r\n  HEAD and Trunk usually not separated by a suture.\r\n\r\n  _Eyes_. Two to eight, not lateral.\r\n\r\n  _Mandibles_ cheliform or unguiculate, representing the interior\r\n    pair of the antennæ of the _Crustacea_.\r\n\r\n  _Palpi_ pediform or cheliform.\r\n\r\n  _Trunk_. Legs eight or their representatives: tibiæ mostly\r\n    consisting of two joints.\r\n\r\n  ABDOMEN with from two to eight spiracles.\r\n\r\nSENSATION.\r\n\r\n  _Nervous System_. A small bilobed brain crowning a double, knotty,\r\n    medullary chord; nerves proceeding from the brain and other\r\n    ganglions to all parts of the body.\r\n\r\nCIRCULATION.\r\n\r\n  _Heart_ unilocular, inaurite, with a system of circulation by\r\n    arteries and veins; blood a cold white sanies.\r\n\r\nRESPIRATION.\r\n\r\n  _Lungs_ replaced by internal gills receiving the air by spiracles.\r\n\r\nDIGESTION.\r\n\r\n  _Liver_, consisting of conglomerate glands, and enveloping the\r\n    intestines[49]; hepatic ducts.\r\n\r\nGENERATION.\r\n\r\n  _Genital organs_ double, ventral; more than one sexual union in the\r\n    course of life.\r\n\r\nThe external characters in this class are the same almost in\r\nevery respect as those which distinguish the _Phalangidæ_, the\r\nwhole difference consisting almost in the systems of circulation,\r\nrespiration, and digestion. Perhaps some future anatomist may\r\ndiscover in the tribe just mentioned, that there is a nearer\r\nagreement between them and the _Arachnida_ in these systems than is\r\nat present suspected, which would prove them true _Arachnida_. I am\r\ninclined to think that _Phrynus_ and _Gonyleptes_, &c. breathe by\r\nbranchial spiracles; but having no opportunity of examining living\r\nspecimens, I dare not speak with any confidence on the subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving thus given you a view of the most important diagnostics by\r\nwhich what we have all along called _Insects_ may scientifically be\r\ndistinguished from other invertebrate animals, it may not be without\r\nuse, if, under this head, I take a more _popular_ and familiar view\r\nof the subject, and say something upon those distinctions which may\r\nattract the attention of the more common observer.\r\n\r\nThe notion of diminutive size, particularly as compared with\r\nvertebrate animals, seems more frequently attached to the idea of\r\nan insect than any other; and this notion is generally correct,\r\nfor one insect that is bigger than the least of the above animals,\r\nthousands and thousands are vastly smaller: but there exist some\r\nthat are considerably larger, whether we take length or bulk into\r\nconsideration, and this in almost every order. To prove this\r\nmost effectually, and that you may have a synoptical view of the\r\ncomparative size of the larger insects of the different orders and\r\ntribes, I now lay before you a table of the dimensions of such of\r\nthe largest as I have had an opportunity of measuring, including\r\nparticularly those giants that are natives of the British isles.\r\n\r\n  Explanation of Table:\r\n\r\n  Column A - Length Inches\r\n         B - Breadth Inches\r\n         C - Expansion of Wings Longitudinal Inches} See note in table\r\n         D - Expansion of Wings Transverse Inches  }\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Order and   |    _Species._       |  A   |  B   |  C   |  D   |\r\n     Family._    |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n  COLEOPTERA.    |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n    CICINDELIDÆ  |_Manticora grandis_  |1-5/8 |  7/10|      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n    ANTHIADÆ     |_Anthia sexguttata_  |1-7/8 |  7/10|      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n    CARABIDÆ     |_Carabus scabrosus_  |1-3/4 |  8/10|      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n    DYTISCIDÆ    |_Dytiscus latissimus_|1-1/2 |1     |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n    STAPHYLINIDÆ |_Staphylinus olens_  |1-1/2 |  5/10|      |      |\r\n                 |   Br.               |      |      |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n    HYDROPHILIDÆ |_Hydrophilus piceus_ |1-3/4 |  7/8 |      |      |\r\n                 |   Br.               |      |      |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n    BUPRESTIDÆ   |_Buprestis grandis_  |2-1/2 |1     |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n                 |--------- _bicolor_  |2-5/12|  3/4 |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n    DYNASTIDÆ    |_Dynastes Hercules_  |4-1/2 |2-1/2 |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |Horns |      |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |Incl. |      |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n                 |_Megasoma Actæon_ K. |4-1/4 |2-1/4 |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |Horns |      |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |Incl. |      |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n    CETONIADÆ    |_Goliathus giganteus_|3-7/10|1-9/10|      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n    LUCANIDÆ     |_Lucanus Cervus_ Br. |2     |  7/10|      |      |\r\n                 |                     |Mands.|      |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |Incl. |      |      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n    TENEBRIONIDÆ |_Tenebrio grandis_?  |1-7/10|  7/10|      |      |\r\n                 |                     |      |      |      |      |\r\n    BRENTIDÆ     |_Brentus_ N.

In the _Mammalia_, the\r\n_Sorex Araneus_, called by the common people here the Ranny, is\r\nnot more than two inches long excluding the tail; and the _Mus\r\nmessorius_, or harvest-mouse, peculiar to the southern counties of\r\nEngland, is still more diminutive: so that to these little animals,\r\nthe larger _Dynastidæ_, _Goliathi_, and _Prioni_, &c., appear giants,\r\nand may compete with the mole in size. Even some of the beetles\r\nof our own country, as the great _Hydrophilus_, the stag-beetle,\r\n&c., are more bulky than the two first-named quadrupeds. Amongst\r\nthe birds, many _Picæ_, _Passeres_, &c., yield to several insects\r\nin dimensions, and their wings when expanded do not extend so far\r\nas those of not a few _Lepidoptera_. The great owl-moth of Brazil\r\n(_Erebus Strix_) in this respect is a larger fowl than the quail.\r\nThose beautiful little creatures, the humming-birds (_Trochilus_ L.),\r\nthe peculiar ornament and life of tropical gardens, which emulate the\r\nmost splendid butterflies in the brilliancy of their plumage, are\r\nsmaller than a considerable number of insects in almost every order,\r\nand even than some of those that are natives of Britain. Various\r\nreptiles also are much inferior in size to many of the insects of the\r\nabove table. The smallest lizard of this country would be outweighed\r\nby the great British beetles lately mentioned, and the mole-cricket\r\n(_Gryllotalpa vulgaris_); and some of the serpent tribe are smaller\r\nthan the larger _Scolopendræ_ and _Iuli_. Amongst the _fishes_ also,\r\nthough some are so enormous in bulk, others in this respect yield\r\nthe palm to several insects. The _minnow_ and the _stickleback_ that\r\nfrequent our own pools and streams are considerably inferior in size\r\nto some of our water beetles.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the table, and comparing the different species that\r\ncompose it with each other, you will perceive that the largest\r\ninsects of the two sections of _Hemiptera_, of the _Lepidoptera_\r\nas to their _body_ merely, of the _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_, in\r\ngeneral size fall considerably short of those of the other orders;\r\nand that certain individuals of the _Orthoptera_ and _Aptera_ bear\r\naway the palm in this respect from all the rest. In the _Coleoptera_\r\nthe giants, with the exception of the _Goliathi_, are chiefly to\r\nbe found amongst the timber devourers in the _Lamellicorn_ and\r\n_Capricorn_ tribes. Of orthopterous insects the _Phasmidæ_ present\r\nthe most striking examples of _magnitude_; and in the _Neuroptera_,\r\nthe _Agrionidæ_ of great _length_.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark here, that although the tropical species\r\nof a genus usually exceed those of colder climates in size, the\r\n_Gryllotalpa_ of Brazil is very considerably smaller than that of\r\nEurope: whether this is the case with the rest of the cricket tribe I\r\nhave not had an opportunity of ascertaining. The _Lepidoptera_, though\r\noften remarkable for the vast expansion of their \"sail-broad vans,\" if\r\nyou consider only their bodies, never attain to gigantic bulk. Even\r\nthe hawk-moths (_Sphinx_ L.), though usually very robust, make no\r\napproach to the size of the great beetles, or the length of some of\r\nthe spectres (_Phasma_) and dragon-flies (_Agrionidæ_). With regard\r\nto the superficial contents of their wings, a considerable difference\r\nobtains in different species where they expand to the same length--for\r\nthe _secondary_ wings are sometimes smaller than the _primary_, and\r\nsometimes they equal them in size. In some instances, also, the latter\r\nalthough long are narrow, and in others they are nearly as wide as\r\nlong: regard, therefore, should be had to their expansion both ways.\r\nIn the _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_, the principal giants are to be\r\nfound in the predaceous or blood-sucking tribes, as _Scolia_, the\r\n_Sphecidæ_, _Pompilidæ_, _Vespidæ_, &c., belonging to the former order;\r\nand the _Asilidæ_ and _Tabanidæ_ to the latter. The true and false\r\nhumble bees (_Bombus_ and _Xylocopa_) and the fly tribe (_Muscidæ_),\r\nthough they sometimes attain to considerable size, scarcely afford\r\nan exception to this observation. Amongst the _Aptera_ none of the\r\n_Hexapods_ strike us by their magnitude, and few of the _Octopods_,\r\nthough the legs of some of the _Phalangidæ_ inclose a vast area. That\r\nin the table would with them describe a circle of six inches diameter,\r\nthough its body is little more than a quarter of an inch in length.\r\nThe _Myriapods_ exceed most insects in the vast elongation of their\r\nbody, which with their motion gives them no slight resemblance to the\r\nserpents. In the class _Arachnida_, the bird-spiders (_Mygale_) are\r\namongst the principal giants, nor do the _Scorpions_ fall far short of\r\nthem--both of them when alive often alarming the beholder as much by\r\ntheir size as by their aspect.\r\n\r\nBut as I have before observed, generally speaking, one of the most\r\nremarkable characters of the insect world, is the little space\r\nthey occupy; for though they touch the vertebrate animals and even\r\nquadrupeds by their giants, yet more commonly in this feature they go\r\nthe contrary way, and by their smallest species reach the confines\r\nof those microscopic tribes that are at the bottom of the scale of\r\nanimal life. I possess an undescribed beetle, allied to _Silpha\r\nminutissima_ E. B.[50], which, though furnished with elytra, wings,\r\nantennæ, legs, and every other organ usually found in the order it\r\nbelongs to, is absolutely not bigger than the full stop that closes\r\nthis period. In several other coleopterous genera there are also very\r\nminute species, as in _Cryptophagus_, _Anisotoma_, _Agathidium_,\r\n&c. I know no _orthopterous_ insect that can be called extremely\r\nminute, except that remarkable one found on the Continent in the\r\nnests of ants, the _Blatta Acervorum_ of Panzer[51], but now called,\r\nI believe, _Myrmecophilus_: nor indeed any in the _Hemiptera_,\r\n_Neuroptera_, and _Diptera_, that approach the extreme limits of\r\nvisibility: but in the _Lepidoptera_, the pygmy _Tinea occultella_\r\nis almost invisible except in flight, being scarcely thicker than\r\na horse's hair, and proportionably short; indeed, many others of\r\nthose lovely Lilliputians, the subcutaneous _Tineæ_, decorated with\r\nbands of gold and silver, and studded with gems and pearls, that in\r\nlarger species would dazzle the beholder's eye, are in size not much\r\nmore conspicuous. In the _Hymenoptera_ order, _Ichneumon Punctum_ of\r\nDr. Shaw, which forms so striking a contrast to his giant _Phasma\r\ndilatatum_, being placed together in the same plate; and another\r\nthat I possess, under the trivial name of _Atomos_, would elude the\r\nsearching eye of the entomologist unless when moving upon glass.\r\nLinné named the tribe of parasites to which these belong, _Minuti_,\r\non account of their generally diminutive size. But these little\r\nminims, under the superintendence of Providence, are amongst the\r\ngreatest benefactors of the human race, since they keep within due\r\nbounds the various destroyers of our produce.\r\n\r\nThe number of minute species of insects seems greatly to exceed\r\nthat of large ones, at least in Europe, of which it may be asserted\r\nprobably with truth, that two-thirds are under a quarter of an inch\r\nin length, and one-third not exceeding much a duodecimal of it. It\r\nmight hold good perhaps in _Coleoptera_, _Hymenoptera_, _Diptera_,\r\nand _Aptera_: but in _Orthoptera_, _Hemiptera_, _Neuroptera_, and\r\nespecially _Lepidoptera_, a large proportion would be found to exceed\r\nthree lines in length. Neither can it be affirmed of extra-European\r\nspecies, of those at least preserved in cabinets, amongst which it\r\nis rare to find an insect less than the fourth of an inch long.\r\nThis, however, must probably be attributed to the inattention of\r\ncollectors, who neglect the more minute species.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough size forms a pretty accurate distinction between insects and\r\nthe great bulk of _vertebrate_ animals, it affords less assistance in\r\nseparating them from the _invertebrate_ classes, which are of every\r\nsize, from the monstrous bulk of some _Cephalopoda_ (cuttle-fish) and\r\n_Mollusca_ (shell-fish, &c.) to the invisible infusory animalcule:\r\nbut external characters, abundantly sufficient for this purpose,\r\nmay be drawn from the general covering, substance, form, parts, and\r\norgans of the body. As I shall enter into pretty full details upon\r\nthis subject when I come to treat of the external anatomy of insects,\r\nI shall here, therefore, only give such a slight and general sketch\r\nof the distinctions just mentioned, as will answer the end I have in\r\nview. I must here repeat what I have before observed, and what it is\r\nnecessary that you should always bear in mind, namely, that at the\r\nlimits of classes and of every other natural group, the characters\r\nbegin to change, those peculiar to the one group beginning gradually\r\nto disappear, and those of the other to show themselves; so that it\r\nis impossible almost to draw up a set of characters so precise as\r\nexactly in every respect to suit all the members of any natural group.\r\n\r\nWhichever way we turn our eyes on the objects of creation,\r\nabove--below--athwart, _analogies_ meet us in every direction, and it\r\nappears clear, that the Book of Nature is a Book of Symbols, in which\r\none thing represents another in endless alternation. And not only\r\ndoes one animal, &c. symbolize another, but even between the parts\r\nand organs of one set of animals there is often an _analogy_ as to\r\ntheir _situation_ and _use_, when there is little or no _affinity_ as\r\nto their _structure_--or again, the analogy is in their _situation_,\r\nwithout affinity in either structure or use. Thus certain parts in\r\none tribe represent other certain parts of another tribe, though\r\nas to their structure there is often a striking disagreement. This\r\nis particularly observable between the vertebrate and invertebrate\r\nanimals. I shall therefore, in my remarks on the general and\r\nparticular structure of insects, contrast it in its most important\r\npoints with that of the first-mentioned tribe.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that strikes us when we look at an insect is its\r\noutside _covering_, or the case that incloses its muscles and internal\r\norgans. If we examine it attentively, we find that it is not like the\r\nskin of quadrupeds and other _Vertebrata_, covering the whole external\r\nsurface of the body; but that in the large majority it consists of\r\nseveral pieces or joints, in this respect resembling the skeleton\r\nof the animals just named; and that even in those in which the body\r\nappears to have no such segments, as in many of the Mites (_Acarus_\r\nL.), they are to be found in the _limbs_. This last circumstance,\r\nto have externally jointed legs, is the peculiar and most general\r\ndistinction by which the _Insecta_ of Linné, including the _Crustacea_,\r\nmay always be known from the other invertebrate animals[52].\r\n\r\nIf we proceed further to examine the _substance_ of this crust or\r\ncovering, though varying in hardness, we shall find it in most\r\ncases, if we exclude from our consideration the shells of the\r\n_Mollusca_, &c., better calculated to resist pressure than that of\r\nthe majority of animals that have no spine. In all the invertebrate\r\ntribes, indeed, the muscles, there being no internal skeleton, are\r\nattached to this skin or its processes, which of course is firmer\r\nthan the internal substance; but in insects it is very often rigid\r\nand horny, and partially difficult to perforate, seldom exhibiting\r\nthat softness and flexibility which is found in the cuticle of birds\r\nand most quadrupeds. From this conformation it has been sometimes\r\nsaid, that insects carry their _bones_ on the _outside_ of their\r\nbody, or have an _external_ skeleton. This idea, though not correct\r\nin all respects, is strictly so in this--that it affords a general\r\npoint of support to the muscles, and the whole structure is erected\r\nupon it, or rather I should say within it. The difference here\r\nbetween _Insects_ and the _Vertebrata_ seems very wide; but some of\r\nthe latter make an approach towards it. I allude to the Chelonian\r\nReptiles (_Testudo_ L.), in which the vertebral column becomes\r\nexternal or merges in the upper shell. The _cyclostomous_ fishes also\r\nare not very wide of insects as to their integument. But on this\r\nsubject I shall be more full hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe _forms_ of insects are so infinitely diversified that they almost\r\ndistance our powers of conception: in this respect they seem to\r\nexceed the fishes and other inhabitants of the ocean, so that endless\r\ndiversity may be regarded as one of their distinctions. But on all\r\ntheir variations of form the Creator has set his seal of symmetry; so\r\nthat, if we meet with an animal in the lower orders in which the parts\r\nare not symmetrical, we may conclude in general that it is no insect.\r\n\r\nBut it is by their _parts_ and _organs_ that insects may be most\r\nreadily distinguished. In the _vertebrate_ animals, the body is\r\nusually considered as divided into _head_, _trunk_, and _limbs_,\r\nthe _abdomen_ forming no part of the skeleton; but in the _insect_\r\ntribes, besides the organs of sense and motion, the body consists of\r\n_three_ principal parts--_Head_, _Trunk_, and _Abdomen_--the _first_,\r\nas was before observed, bearing the principal organs of _sense_ and\r\n_manducation_; the _second_ most commonly those of _motion_; and the\r\nthird those of _generation_--the organs of respiration being usually\r\ncommon to both trunk and abdomen. These three primary parts,--though\r\nin some insects the head is not separated from the trunk by any\r\nsuture, as for instance in the _Arachnida_; and in others, head,\r\ntrunk, and abdomen form only _one_ piece, as in some mites,--still\r\nexist in all, and in the great majority they are separated by\r\nincisures more or less deeply marked: this is particularly visible in\r\nthe _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_, which, in this respect, are formed\r\nupon a common model; and in the rest, with the above exceptions, it\r\nmay be distinctly traced.\r\n\r\nThe _head_ of insects is clearly analogous to that of vertebrate\r\nanimals, except in one respect, that they do not breathe by it. It\r\nis the seat probably of the same senses as _seeing_, _hearing_,\r\n_smelling_, _tasting_--and more peculiarly perhaps of that of\r\n_touch_. The _eyes_ of insects, though allowed on all hands to be\r\norgans of _sight_, are differently circumstanced in many particulars\r\nfrom those of the animals last mentioned; they are fixed, have\r\nneither iris nor pupil, are often compound, and are without eyelids\r\nto cover them during sleep or repose; there are usually two compound\r\nones composed of hexagonal facets, but in some instances there\r\nare four; and from one to three simple in particular orders. The\r\n_antennæ_ of insects in some respects correspond with the _ears_\r\nof the animals we are comparing with them; but whether they convey\r\nthe vibrations of sound has not been ascertained: that they receive\r\npulses of some kind from the atmosphere I shall prove to you\r\nhereafter--so that if insects do not _hear_ with them in one sense,\r\nthey may, by communicating information, and by _aëroscopy_, to use\r\nLehman's term, not directly in his sense[53], supply the place of\r\nears, which would render them properly analogous to those organs.\r\nThat in numbers these remarkable organs are _tactors_ is generally\r\nagreed, but this is not their _universal_ use. That insects _smell_\r\nhas been often proved; but the organ of this sense has not been\r\nascertained. What has improperly been called the _clypeus_, or the\r\npart terminating the face above the upper lip (_labrum_), is in the\r\nsituation of the _nose_ of the _Vertebrata_, and therefore so far\r\nanalogous to it, and in some cases even in form: I therefore call it\r\nthe _nose_. Whether this part represents the nose by being furnished\r\nwith what answer the purpose of _nostrils_, residing somewhere at or\r\nabove the suture that joins it to the upper lip, I cannot positively\r\naffirm; but from the observations of M. P. Huber, with regard to the\r\nhive-bee, it appears that at least these insects have the organ of\r\nthe sense in question somewhere in the vicinity of the mouth, and\r\nabove the tongue[54]: analogy, therefore, would lead us to look for\r\nits site somewhere between the apex of the nose and the upper lip;\r\nand in some other cases, which I shall hereafter advert to, there is\r\nfurther reason for thinking that it actually resides at the apex of\r\nthe nose. The organ of _taste_ in insects, though some have advanced\r\ntheir _palpi_ to that honour, is doubtless in some part within the\r\nmouth analogous in a degree to the tongue and palate of the higher\r\nanimals. The organs of manducation, in what may be deemed the most\r\nperfect description of mouth, consist of an _upper lip_ closing the\r\nmouth above, a pair of _mandibles_ moving horizontally that close its\r\nupper sides, and a _lower lip_ with a pair of _maxillæ_ attached to\r\nit, which close the mouth below and on the under sides, both labium\r\nand maxillæ being furnished with jointed moveable organs peculiar\r\nto annulose pedate animals, called palpi. In some tribes these\r\norgans assume a different form, that they may serve for suction;\r\nbut though in many cases some receive an increment at the expense\r\nof others, and a variation in form takes place, none, as M. Savigny\r\nhas elaborately proved, are totally obliterated or without some\r\nrepresentative[55]. The organs now described, except the upper lip,\r\nare formed after a quite different type from those of _Vertebrata_,\r\nwith which they agree only in their oral situation and use.\r\n\r\nThe second portion of the body is the _Trunk_, which is interposed\r\nbetween the head and abdomen, and in most insects consists of three\r\nprincipal segments, subdivided into several pieces, which I shall\r\nafterwards explain to you. I shall only observe, that some slight\r\nanalogy may perhaps be traced between these pieces and the vertebræ\r\nand ribs of vertebrate animals, particularly the Chelonian reptiles.\r\nThis is most observable in _Gryllus_ L. and _Libellula_ L., in which\r\nthe lateral pieces of the trunk are parallel to each other[56]. In\r\nthe _Diptera_ and many of the _Aptera_ most of these pieces are not\r\nseparated by sutures. Each of the segments into which the trunk is\r\nresolvable bears a pair of jointed _legs_, the first pair pointing\r\nto the _head_, and the two last to the _anus_. These legs in their\r\ncomposition bear a considerable analogy to those of quadrupeds,\r\n&c., consisting of _hip_, _thigh_, _leg_, and _foot_; but the last\r\nof these, the foot or _Tarsus_, is almost universally monodactyle,\r\nunless we regard the _Calcaria_ that arm the end of the tibia, as\r\nrepresenting fingers or toes, an idea which their use seems to\r\njustify. _Acheta monstrosa_ and _Tridactylus paradoxus_, however[57],\r\nexhibit some appearance of a phalanx of these organs. They differ\r\nfrom them first in number, the thoracic legs being invariably _six_\r\nin all insects, with the exception of the _Octopods_ or most of the\r\n_Trachean Arachnida_, which have usually _eight_. In the _Myriapods_,\r\nthough there are hundreds of _abdominal_ legs, only six are affixed\r\nto the _trunk_. Next they differ with regard to the _situation_ of\r\ntheir legs; for though the anterior pair or arms are analogous in\r\nthat respect, the posterior pair are not, since in _quadrupeds_\r\nthese legs are placed _behind_ the abdomen, but in _insects before_\r\nit--in fact, in the former the legs may be considered as placed at\r\neach end of the body, excluding only the head and tail, but in the\r\nlatter in the middle. Though they correspond with those of quadrupeds\r\nin being in _pairs_ or opposite to each other, yet their direction\r\nwith respect to the body is different, the legs of quadrupeds, &c.\r\nbeing nearly straight, whereas in insects they are bent or form\r\nan angle, often very obtuse at the principal articulations, which\r\noccasions them to extend far beyond the body, and when long to\r\ninclose a proportionally greater space. The _wings_ are the organs\r\nof motion with which the upper side of the trunk is furnished; and\r\nthese, though they are the instruments of flight, are in no other\r\nrespect analogous to those of birds, which replace the anterior legs\r\nof quadrupeds, but approach nearer, both in substance and situation,\r\nto the fins of some fishes, and perhaps in some respects even to\r\nthe leaves of plants. M. Latreille is of opinion, That the four\r\nwings or their representatives replace the four thoracic legs of the\r\ndecapod _Crustacea_[58]. Upon this opinion, which shows great depth\r\nof research and practical acumen, I shall have occasion to express\r\nmy sentiments when I come to treat more at large on the anatomy of\r\nthe trunk and its members; at any rate they do not replace the two\r\nanterior pair of legs of the hexapod _Aptera_. When merely used as\r\nwings, they commonly consist of a fine transparent double membrane,\r\nstrengthened by various longitudinal and transverse nervures, or\r\nbones as some regard them, accompanied by air-vessels, of which more\r\nhereafter, as well as of their kind and characters. I shall only\r\nobserve, that insects are known from all other winged animals, by\r\nhaving _four_ wings, or what represent them, and this even generally\r\nin those that are supposed to have only a pair. Another peculiarity\r\ndistinguishes the trunk of insects that you will in vain look for\r\nin the vertebrate animals--these are one or two pair of lateral\r\n_spiracles_ or breathing pores. Though the respiratory sacs, &c. of\r\nbirds are almost as widely dispersed as the tracheæ and bronchiæ\r\nof insects[59], yet their respiration is perfectly pulmonary, and\r\nnothing like these pores is to be discovered in them.\r\n\r\nThe principal peculiarity of the third part of the body, the\r\n_abdomen_, is its situation behind the posterior pair of thoracic\r\nlegs, and its rank as forming a distinct portion of what represents\r\nthe skeleton. In most insects it is so closely affixed to the\r\nposterior part of the trunk as to appear like a continuation of\r\nit, but in the majority of the _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_, and in\r\nthe _Araneidan Arachnida_, or spiders, it is separated by a deep\r\nincisure; and in the first-mentioned tribe is mostly suspended to\r\nthe trunk by a footstalk, sometimes of wonderful length and tenuity.\r\nIn the _Mammalia_ the _male_ genital organs are partly external;\r\nbut in insects as well as in many of the vertebrate animals, except\r\nwhen employed, they are retracted within the body. This part is the\r\nprincipal seat of the respiratory pores or spiracles, many having\r\neight in each side, while others have only one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal external characters which distinguish\r\n_Insecta_ and _Arachnida_, or what we have heretofore regarded as\r\ninsects, to which here may be added another connected with their\r\ninternal organization. The union of the sexes takes place in the\r\nsame manner as amongst larger animals; and the females with very\r\nfew exceptions, more apparent than real, are oviparous. They are,\r\nhowever, distinguished by this remarkable peculiarity already alluded\r\nto, that, except in the case of the _Arachnida_, one impregnation\r\nfertilizes all the eggs they are destined to produce. In most cases,\r\nafter these are laid, the females die immediately, and the males\r\nafter they have performed their office, though they will sometimes\r\nunite themselves to more than one female. One other circumstance may\r\nbe named here--that no genuine insect or Arachnidan has yet been\r\nfound to inhabit the ocean.\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude this letter, it is necessary to apprize you, that\r\nevery thing which it contains relative to the characters of insects,\r\nhas reference to them only in their _last_ or perfect state, not in\r\nthose preparatory ones through which you are aware that the majority\r\nof them must pass. The peculiar characteristics of them in these\r\nstates--in the _egg_, the _larva_, and the _pupa_, will be the\r\nsubjects of my next letters, which will be devoted to a more detailed\r\nview of the metamorphosis of insects than I gave you before when\r\nadverting to this subject[60].\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Εναιμα, Αναιμα. _Hist.

Latreille is of opinion, that the\r\ntwo last segments of the thorax in some insects are represented by the\r\nfirst of the abdomen, and that the upper half segment of this part in\r\n_Coleoptera_ also represents the same. Latr. _De quelques Appendices,\r\n&c._ _Annales Générales des Sciences Physiques._ A Bruxelles, vi.\r\nlivrais, xviii. 14. In fact, in the _Lepidoptera_, when the abdomen is\r\nseparated from the trunk, this segment usually remains attached to the\r\nlatter. In the _Myriapods_, the trunk is to be distinguished from the\r\nabdomen only by its bearing the three first pair of legs.\r\n\r\n[8] There is no general rule without exceptions, and no character is\r\nso universal as to be distinctly exhibited by every member of a class\r\nor other natural group. Thus, in the majority of the _mites_ (_Acarus_\r\nL.) the body is marked by no segments, and the only articulation or\r\nincision is in the legs, palpi, &c. But as the exception does not\r\nmake void the rule, so neither does the extenuation or absence of\r\nsome primary character at its points of junction with others, in some\r\nindividuals, annihilate the class or group.\r\n\r\n[9] _Hist.

Metaphysicians reckon _seven_ principal operations of\r\nthe mind; musicians _seven_ principal musical tones; and opticians\r\n_seven_ primary colours. In Scripture the abstract idea of this\r\nnumber is--_completion_--_fullness_--_perfection_. I have a notion,\r\nbut not yet sufficiently matured, that Mr. MacLeay's _quinaries_ are\r\nresolvable into _septenaries_.\r\n\r\n[22] _Anim. sans Vertebr._ i. 381.\r\n\r\n[23] See on this point MacLeay, _Hor.

The _Trachean Arachnida_ have only a pair\r\nof spiracles, from which the tracheæ must _radiate_, if I may so apply\r\nthe term, in order to convey the necessary supply of air to every part\r\nof the body. _Scutigera_, as far as I can discover, has only a _single_\r\nseries of _dorsal_ spiracles (see PLATE XXIX. FIG. 20)--an unusual\r\nsituation for them: in these also, to attain the above end, each\r\ntrachea must also radiate, so as to supply each part of the segment\r\nit is in. Those of _Iulus_, according to the observations of Savi\r\n(_Osservaz. per servire alla Storia di una Specie de Iulus_, &c. 15--),\r\nconsist of bundles of parallel tracheæ. Perhaps these circumstances\r\nwould warrant the considering of these _Arachnida_ and the _Myriapoda_\r\nas primary classes? The genus _Galeodes_ is said to breathe by gills\r\nsimilar to those of the _Araneidæ_, which structure, probably, carries\r\nwith it a system of circulation, and exhibits a _third_ type in the\r\n_Arachnida_, with four palpi, six legs, and a distinct thorax. This\r\ngenus, then, is the corresponding point in the _Arachnida_ to the\r\n_Hexapod Aptera_, as the _Scorpions_ are to the _Cheliferidæ_ or\r\nPseudo-Scorpions, and the _Araneidæ_ to the other _Octopods_; and these\r\nanalogies furnish a strong proof, that the _Tracheans_ belong rather to\r\n_Insecta_ than _Arachnida_.

It is necessary, therefore, that previously to considering\r\nseparately and in detail the _states_ of insects, I should again call\r\nyour attention to this subject, and endeavour to ascertain whether Dr.\r\nHerold's hypothesis rests upon a solid foundation; or whether that\r\nadopted from Swammerdam by all the most eminent Entomologists and\r\nPhysiologists since his time can be maintained against it.\r\n\r\nI shall first give you a short abstract of the new hypothesis.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Herold--_The successive skins of the caterpillar,\r\nthe pupa-case, the future butterfly, and its parts and organs, except\r\nthose of sex which he discovered in the newly excluded larva, do\r\nnot preexist as germes, but are formed successively from the_ rete\r\nmucosum, _which itself is formed anew upon every change of skin from\r\nwhat he denominates the_ blood, _or the chyle after it has passed\r\nthrough the pores of the intestinal canal into the general cavity of\r\nthe body, where, being oxygenated by the air-vessels, it performs the\r\nnutritive functions of blood. He attributes these formations to a_\r\nvis formatrix (Bildende Kraft).\r\n\r\n_The caul or epiploon_ (Fett-masse), _the_ corps graisseux _of\r\nReaumur, &c., which he supposes to be formed from the superfluous\r\nblood, he allows, with most physiologists, to be stored up in the\r\nlarva, that in the pupa state it may serve for the development of\r\nthe imago. But he differs from them in asserting that in this state\r\nit is destined to two distinct purposes--first, for the production\r\nof the muscles of the butterfly, which he affirms are generated from\r\nit in the shape of slender bundles of fibres;--and secondly, for\r\nthe development and nutrition of the organs formed in the larva, to\r\neffect which, he says, it is dissolved again into the mass of blood,\r\nand being oxygenated by the air-vessels, becomes fit for nutrition,\r\nwhence the epiploon appears to be a kind of concrete chyle_[62].\r\n\r\nNeed I repeat to you the hypothesis to which this stands\r\nopposed--_That every caterpillar at its first exclusion contains\r\nwithin itself the germe of the future butterfly and of all its\r\nenvelopes, which successively presenting themselves are thrown off,\r\ntill it appear in perfection and beauty, with all its parts and\r\norgans, when no further development takes place._\r\n\r\nI believe you will agree with me, when you have read and considered\r\nthe above abstract of Dr. Herold's hypothesis, that in it he\r\nsubstitutes a name for knowledge, talks of a _vis formatrix_ because\r\nhis assisted eye cannot penetrate to the primordial essence or state\r\nof the germes of being, and denies the existence of what he cannot\r\ndiscover[63]. From ancient ages philosophers have done the same, to\r\nconceal their own ignorance of causes under a sounding name, when\r\nthey have endeavoured to penetrate within the veil of the _sanctum\r\nsanctorum_, which it is not permitted to vain man to enter. This\r\nhas occasioned the invention, not only of the term in question, but\r\nof many others, as little meriting the appellation of _Signs of\r\nideas_; such as _Plastic Nature_, _Epigenesis_, _Panspermia_, _Idea\r\nseminalis_, _Nisus formativus_, &c. But upon this subject you cannot\r\ndo better than consult what the learned Dr. Barclay has said in his\r\nadmirable work _On Life and Organization_[64], in which he has placed\r\nthe inanity, the _vox et præterea nihil_, of such high-sounding\r\nterms in their true light. The processes of nature in the formation\r\nand development of the _fœtus in utero_, of the chick in the egg,\r\nof the butterfly in the caterpillar, we in vain attempt fully to\r\ninvestigate; yet we can easily comprehend that pre-existent germes,\r\nby the constant accretion of new matter in a proper state, may be\r\ngradually developed, but we find it impossible to conceive how, by\r\nthe action of second causes, without the intervention of the first\r\ncause, the butterfly should be formed in the caterpillar, unless it\r\npreexists there as a germe or fœtus. \"Is it not clear,\" asks Dr.\r\nVirey in his lively manner, \"as Blumenbach and other Physiologists\r\nmaintain, that there is a formative power, a _nisus formativus_,\r\nwhich organizes the embryo? Admirable discovery!\" says he, \"which\r\nteaches us that the fœtus forms itself because it forms itself! As\r\nif you should affirm that the stone falls because it falls[65]!\"\r\nHad Dr. Herold considered what Bonnet says with as much good sense\r\nas modesty, he would never have imagined that his discovering the\r\norgans of the butterfly one after the other at certain periods in\r\nthe caterpillar, was any sound argument against their preexistence\r\nand coexistence as germes. \"Organs,\" says that amiable and excellent\r\nPhysiologist, \"that have no existence as to us, exist as they respect\r\nthe embryo, and perform their essential functions; the term of their\r\nbecoming visible is that which has been erroneously mistaken for\r\nthe period of their existence[66].\" This has been Dr. Herold's grand\r\nerror; he mistook the commencement of the _appearance_ of the organs\r\nof the butterfly for that of their _existence_, and yet the early\r\nappearance of the sexual organs ought to have led him to a conclusion\r\nthe reverse of that which he has adopted.\r\n\r\nDr. Virey has observed with great truth--that \"Every being has a\r\npeculiar and unique nature, which would be impossible if the body was\r\ncomposed of parts made at several intervals, and without a uniform\r\npower that acts by concert[67]:\" and every Physiologist acquainted\r\nwith the history of insects that undergo a _complete_ metamorphosis\r\nwill allow, that their developments and acquisition of new parts and\r\norgans take place according to a _law_ which regulates the number,\r\nkind, and times of them, differing in different species, and which\r\nhas had an invariable operation, since the first creation, upon every\r\nsound individual that has been produced into the world.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this law, one species changes its skin only _four_\r\ntimes, and another _five_ or _six_;--in some cases the first skins\r\nshall be covered or bristled with hairs or spines, and the last\r\nbe naked and without arms;--that which forms the case of the pupæ\r\nshall differ in form and substance from the preceding skins, varying\r\nin both respects in different species; and finally the butterfly\r\nshall invariably follow, when no other change but the last mortal\r\none shall take place. Can this law, so constantly observed, be the\r\nresult of a _blind_ power? Or are we to suppose that the Deity\r\nhimself is always at work to _create_ the necessary organs in their\r\ntime and place? Is it not much more consonant to reason and the\r\ngeneral analogy of nature, to suppose that these parts and organs\r\nexist in embryo in the newly-hatched caterpillar, and grow and\r\nare successively developed by the action of the nutritive fluid?\r\nIn the pupa of many _Diptera_ the inclosed animal, even under the\r\nmicroscope, appears without parts or organs, like a mere pulp;\r\nbut Bonnet tells us, that if boiled, all the parts of the pupa\r\nappear[68], which proves the preexistence of these parts even when\r\nnot to be discerned, and that nothing but the evaporation of the\r\nfluids in which they swim is wanted to render them visible.\r\n\r\nMr. William MacLeay has with great truth observed: \"The true\r\ncriterion of animal as well as vegetable perfection is the ability\r\nto continue the species[69];\" and in their progress to this state\r\ncertain changes take place in the parts and organs of _all_ animals\r\nand vegetables: there is, therefore, an analogy in this respect\r\nbetween them; and this analogy also furnishes another argument\r\nagainst Dr. Herold's hypothesis, as we shall presently see. These\r\nchanges are of three kinds: In the vegetable kingdom, at least in\r\nthe phænogamous classes, there is a succession of developments\r\nterminating in the appearance of the generative organs, inclosed\r\nin the flower; in this kind the integuments, or most of them,\r\nare usually _persistent_. In insects and other annulose and some\r\nvertebrate animals, there is a succession of spoliations, or\r\nsimultaneous changes of the whole integument, till the animal appears\r\nin its perfect form with powers of reproduction; in this kind the\r\ninteguments are _caducous_.--In man and most of the vertebrate\r\nanimals there is a gradual action of the vital forces in different\r\norgans till they are fitted for reproduction; accompanied, as\r\nprogress is made to the adult state, by the acquisition of certain\r\norgans, &c. as of teeth, horns, pubes, feathers, &c.[70] Let us\r\nnow consider a little in detail the analogies that appear to exist\r\nbetween the second and the first and third kinds. I shall first\r\nconsider the latter as the least obvious. That able, judicious, and\r\nlearned physiologist, Dr. Virey, has pointed out no inconsiderable\r\nresemblance between the metamorphosis of the insect, and the changes,\r\nwhich he denominates a metamorphosis by metastasis, to which most\r\nvertebrate animals are subject. In them, he observes, a state\r\nanalogous to the _larva_ state begins at the exclusion of the fœtus\r\nfrom the womb; it is deprived of teeth, and its viscera are only\r\naccommodated to milk: in the cornute species the horns are in embryo:\r\nthe digestive system now preponderates, and the great enjoyment is\r\n_eating_. A second state, in a degree analogous to that of _pupa_,\r\ncommences at the period of dentition--the teeth now produce another\r\nmodification in the intestinal canal, which becomes capable of\r\nreceiving and digesting solid food: during this period the vital\r\nforces are all tending to produce the perfect state of the animal;\r\nand in this state, in man especially, the individual is _educated_\r\nand fitted to discharge the duties of active life. Again, analogous\r\nto the _imago_ state is the age of puberty, in which the complete\r\ndevelopment of the sexual powers takes place in both sexes, and the\r\nanimal has arrived at its acme, and can continue its kind[71]: now\r\nthe digestive powers diminish in their activity, and love reigns\r\nparamount. When this state is fully attained, no further or higher\r\nchange is to be expected, and the progress is soon towards decay and\r\nthe termination of the animal's mortal career. So we see that in fact\r\nman and other _mammalia_, though they do not simultaneously cast\r\ntheir skins like the insect; or pass into a state of intermediate\r\nrepose, before they attain the perfection of their nature, like the\r\ncaterpillar; have their three _states_, in each of which they acquire\r\nnew parts, powers, and appetites.\r\n\r\nBut a more striking analogy has been traced between the insects\r\nthat undergo a complete metamorphosis and the _vegetable_ kingdom;\r\nfor though the _primary_ analogy seems to be between the _Polypus_\r\nand the _Plant_, yet the _secondary_ one with the _Insect_ is not\r\nby any means remote. There are circumstances to which I shall have\r\noccasion hereafter to call your attention, which afford some ground\r\nfor supposing, that the substance of the insect and the vegetable\r\npartakes of the same nature, at least approximates more nearly, than\r\nthat of the insect and the vertebrate animal; and every one who\r\nhas observed these little creatures with any attention, will have\r\nobserved amongst them forms and organs borrowed as it were from the\r\nkingdom of Flora; and _vice versâ_ the Botanist, if he makes the\r\ncomparison, will find amongst his favourite tribes many striking\r\nresemblances of certain insects. But the analogy does not stop here;\r\nfor the butterfly and the plant appear to have been created with\r\na particular reference to each other, both in the epoch of their\r\nappearance and the changes that take place in them. Thus, as Dr.\r\nVirey has observed, the caterpillar is simultaneous with the leaf\r\nof the tree or plant on which it feeds, and the butterfly with the\r\nflowers of which it imbibes the nectar[72]. Swammerdam, I believe,\r\nwas the first who noticed the analogy between the _changes_ of\r\nthe insect and the vegetable, and has given a table in which he\r\nhas contrasted their developments, including other animals that\r\nundergo a metamorphosis[73]: an idea which has been generalized\r\nby Bonnet[74], and adopted and enlarged by Dr. Virey[74]. A state\r\nanalogous to that of the _larva_ in the insect begins in the plant\r\nwhen it is disclosed from the seed, or springs from its hybernaculum\r\nin the bulb, &c., or is evolved from the gemma; integument after\r\nintegument, often in various forms, as cotyledon, radical, cauline,\r\nor floral leaves, expands as the stem rises, all which envelopes\r\nincase the true representative of the plant, the fructification, as\r\nthe various skins do the future butterfly. When these integuments\r\nare all expanded, the fructification appears inclosed by the calyx\r\nor corolla as the case may be, in which the generative organs are\r\nmatured for their office--this is the bud, which is clearly analogous\r\nto the _pupa_ state of the insect. Next the calyx and corolla expand,\r\nthe impregnation of the germen takes place, and the seed being\r\nripened, and dispersed by the opening of the seed-vessel or ovary of\r\nthe plant, the individual dies: thus the _imago_ state of the insect\r\nhas its representative in the plant. \"If we place,\" says Dr. Virey,\r\n\"here the egg of the insect, next its caterpillar, a little further\r\nthe chrysalis, and lastly the butterfly--what is this but an animal\r\nstem--an elongation perfectly similar to that of the plant issuing\r\nfrom the seed to attain its blossoming and propagation?\"[75]\r\n\r\nThere being, therefore, this general analogy in their progress to\r\nthat state in which they can continue their species between every\r\npart of animated nature, it holds good, I think, that the same\r\nanalogy should take place in their developments. If the adult man\r\nor quadruped, &c. is evidently an evolution of the fœtus, as from\r\nmicroscopical observations it appears that they are[76], if the\r\nteeth, horns, and other parts, &c. to be acquired in his progress to\r\nthat state are already in him in their embryos, we may also conclude\r\nthat the butterfly and its organs, &c. are all in the newly-hatched\r\ncaterpillar. Again, if the blossom and its envelopes are contained\r\nin the gemma, the bulb, &c. where they have been discovered[77],\r\nit follows analogically that the butterfly and its integuments all\r\npreexist in its forerunner.\r\n\r\nPerhaps after this view of the objections to Dr. Herold's hypothesis,\r\nit will not be necessary to say much with regard to the argument\r\nhe draws from the change of organs--the loss of some and the\r\nacquisition of others--since this may readily be conceived to be the\r\nnatural consequence of the vital forces tending more and more to the\r\nformation of the butterfly, and the withdrawing of their action more\r\nand more from the caterpillar; I shall not, therefore, enter further\r\ninto the question, especially since the change of organs will come\r\nmore regularly under our notice upon a future occasion.\r\n\r\nWinged insects, many branchiopod _Crustacea_, and the Batracian\r\nreptiles, have been observed by Dr. Virey to bear some analogy to the\r\n_mammalia_, _aves_, &c. in another respect. In leaving their egg,\r\nthey only quit their first integument, answering to the _chorion_ or\r\nexternal envelope of the human fœtus; they therefore still continue\r\na kind of fœtus, so to speak, more or less enveloped under other\r\ntunics, and principally in their _amnios_, or the covering in which\r\nthe fœtus floats in the _liquor amnii_[78]. This the butterfly does\r\nin the pupa case; and its birth from this, under this view, will be\r\nthe true birth of the animal. In the human subject, the ova upon\r\nimpregnation are said to pass from the ovary through the Fallopian\r\ntube into the uterus. In the insect world, upon impregnation, the\r\neggs pass first from the ovaries into the oviduct, answering to the\r\nFallopian tube, which in them terminates in the _ovipositor_, or\r\nthe instrument by which the parent animal conveys the eggs to their\r\nproper station: there is, therefore, nothing properly analogous to\r\nthe uterus in the insect, and the substance upon which the larva\r\nfeeds upon exclusion answers the purpose of a placenta.\r\n\r\nAfter this general view of the most modern theories with regard to\r\nthe _metamorphosis_ of insects, I shall in the present and some\r\nfollowing letters, treat separately of the different states through\r\nwhich these little beings successively pass.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first of these is the _Egg state_, the whole class of insects\r\nbeing strictly oviparous. Some few tribes indeed bring into the\r\nworld living young ones, and have on that account been considered\r\nas _viviparous_, but incorrectly, for the embryos of none of these\r\nare nourished, as in the true viviparous animals, within a uterus\r\nby means of a placenta, but receive their development within true\r\neggs which are hatched in the body of the mother. This is proved\r\nby the observations of Leeuwenhoek, who found eggs in the abdomen\r\nof a female scorpion[79]; and of Reaumur, with regard to the\r\nflesh-fly (_Musca carnaria_) and other viviparous flies as they\r\nhave been called[80]. A similar mode of production takes place in\r\nvipers and some other reptiles, which have hence been denominated\r\n_ovo-viviparous_, to distinguish them from the true viviparous\r\nanimals--the class _Mammalia_. By far the larger portion of\r\ninsects is oviparous in the ordinary acceptation of the term. The\r\novo-viviparous tribes at present known are scorpions; the flesh-fly\r\nand several other flies; a minute gnat belonging to Latreille's\r\nfamily of _Tipulariæ_[81]; some species of _Coccus_; some bugs\r\n(_Cimicidæ_)[82]; and most _Aphides_, which last also exhibit the\r\nsingular fact of individuals of the same species being some oviparous\r\nand others ovo-viviparous, the former being longer in proportion than\r\nthe latter.--Bonnet, however, is of opinion that the eggs of the\r\nfirst are not perfect eggs, but a kind of cocoon, which defends the\r\nlarva, already formed in some degree, from the cold of winter[83].\r\n\r\nWhen excluded from the body of the mother, or from the egg, as has\r\nbeen before observed, some insects appear nearly in the form of\r\ntheir parents, which, with a very slight alteration, they always\r\nretain; others, and the greater number, assume an appearance totally\r\ndifferent from that of their parents, which they acquire only after\r\npassing through various changes. It is to these last, which have\r\nchiefly engaged the attention of Entomologists, that the title of\r\nmetamorphoses has been often restricted. As, however, those insects\r\nwhich undergo the slightest change of form, as spiders do, undergo\r\n_some_ change, and almost all insects cast their skins several\r\ntimes[84] before they attain maturity, Linné and most Entomologists,\r\ntill very recently, have regarded the whole class as undergoing\r\nmetamorphoses, and as passing through _four_ different states, viz.\r\nthe Egg--the Larva--the Pupa--and the Imago.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, however, that in ovo-viviparous species _three_ states\r\nof their existence only come under our cognizance, as these, being\r\nhatched in the body of the mother, come forth first under the form of\r\nlarvæ. There is even one tribe of insects which presents the strange\r\nanomaly of being born in the _pupa_ state. This is the Linnean\r\ngenus _Hippobosca_ (_Pupipara_ fam. Latr.), to which our forest-fly\r\nbelongs, the females of which lay bodies so much resembling eggs,\r\nthat they were long considered as such until their true nature was\r\nascertained by Reaumur (most of whose observations were confirmed\r\nby De Geer), who, from their size, which nearly equals that of\r\nthe parent fly--from their slight motion when first extruded--from\r\nspiraculiform points which run down each side of them--and lastly,\r\nfrom their producing not a larva, as all other insects' eggs do,\r\nbut perfect flies in the winged state--inferred, and doubtless with\r\nreason, that they are not real eggs, but pupæ, or larvæ just ready\r\nto assume the pupa state, which, however strange it may seem, have\r\npassed the egg and larva states in the body of the mother[85].\r\n\r\nInsects, therefore, as to their mode of birth, may be divided into--\r\n\r\nI. _Ovo-viviparous_, subdivided into--\r\n\r\n    1. _Larviparous_, coming forth from the matrix of the mother in\r\n       the state of larvæ, as the Scorpion (_Scorpio_), the Flesh-fly\r\n       (_Musca_), the Plant-louse (_Aphis_), &c.\r\n\r\n    2. _Pupiparous_, continuing in the matrix of the mother during\r\n       the larva state, and coming forth in that of _pupa_, as the\r\n       Forest-fly (_Hippobosca equina_), the Sheep-louse (_Melophagus\r\n       ovinus_), the Bat-louse (_Nycteribia Vespertilionis_), &c.\r\n\r\nII. _Oviparous_. All other insects.\r\n\r\nOur business for the remainder of this letter will be with the latter\r\ndescription of these little animals.\r\n\r\nThe unerring foresight with which the female deposits her eggs\r\nin the precise place where the larvæ, when excluded, are sure to\r\nfind suitable food; and the singular instruments with which, for\r\nthis purpose, the extremity of their abdomen is furnished, have\r\nbeen noticed in a former letter[86], and those last mentioned will\r\nbe adverted to in a future one. I shall now, therefore, confine\r\nmyself to other circumstances connected with the subject, arranged\r\nfor the sake of order under several distinct heads, as--their\r\n_exclusion_--_situation_--_substance_--_number_--_size_--_figure_--\r\n_colour_--and _period of hatching_.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. _Exclusion._ The exclusion or extrusion of the impregnated eggs\r\ntakes place, when, passing from the ovary into the oviduct, they are\r\nconducted by means of the ovipositor, in which it terminates, to\r\ntheir proper situation. By far the greater number of insects extrude\r\nthem _singly_, a longer interval elapsing between the passage of each\r\negg in some than in others. In those tribes which place their eggs\r\nin groups, such as most butterflies and moths, and many beetles,\r\nthey pass from the ovaries usually with great rapidity; while in the\r\n_Ichneumonidæ_, _Sphegidæ_, _Œstri_, and other parasitic genera,\r\nwhich usually deposit their eggs singly, an interval of some minutes,\r\nhours, or perhaps even days, intervenes between the extrusion of\r\neach egg. One remarkable instance of the former mode I noticed in\r\nmy letter on the _Perfect Societies_ of Insects[87]; another may\r\nbe cited, to which you may yourself be a witness--I allude to that\r\ncommon moth, vulgarly called the _Ghost (Hepialus Humuli)_, which\r\nlays a large number of minute black eggs, resembling grains of\r\ngunpowder, and ejects them so fast that, according to De Geer, they\r\nmay be said to _run_ from the oviduct, and are sometimes expelled\r\nwith the force of a popgun[88]. A Tetrapterous insect, the genus of\r\nwhich is uncertain, is said, when it is taken, to discharge its eggs\r\nlike shot from a gun[89]. And a friend of mine, who had observed with\r\nattention the proceedings of a common crane-fly (_Tipula_), assured\r\nme that several females which he caught projected their eggs to the\r\ndistance of more than ten inches.\r\n\r\nA few _Diptera_ extrude them in a sort of chain or necklace, each\r\negg being connected by a glutinous matter with that which precedes\r\nand follows it. In a small species of a genus allied to _Psychoda_\r\n(a kind of midge), which one season was abundant in a window of my\r\nhouse, this necklace is composed of eggs joined by their sides, not\r\nunlike those strung by children of the seeds of the mallow[90]. Other\r\n_Tipulidæ_ on the contrary extrude their eggs joined end to end,\r\nso as to resemble a necklace of oval beads. _Beris clavipes_ and\r\n_Sciura Thomæ_, two other flies, produce a chain about an inch long,\r\nconsisting of oval eggs connected, in an oblique position, side by\r\nside; an arrangement very similar prevails in the ribband of eggs\r\nwhich drop from some of the _Ephemeræ_[91].\r\n\r\nThese eggs, like those of the insects first mentioned, though\r\nconnected, are expelled in succession; but other tribes, as the\r\n_Libellulidæ_, with the exception of _Agrion_, many _Ephemeræ_,\r\n_Trichopterous_ insects, &c. expel the whole at once, as it were\r\nin a mass. In those first mentioned they are gummed together in an\r\noblong cluster[92]. In one _Ephemera_ mentioned by Reaumur[93], they\r\nformed two oblong masses, each containing from three to four hundred\r\neggs, and three and a half or four lines long. These animals as soon\r\nas their wings are developed eject these masses by two orifices,\r\nand are aided in the process by two vesicles full of air, wherever\r\nthey happen to alight or to fall; in most instances it is the water,\r\ntheir proper element, that receives them, but the animal does not\r\nappear to know the difference between a solid and a liquid, and\r\nseems only anxious how to free herself from a burthen that oppresses\r\nher; all has been contrived that an insect so short-lived may finish\r\nher different operations with the utmost celerity: the term of her\r\nexistence would not have admitted the leisurely extrusion of such a\r\nnumber of eggs in succession[94]. Some _Trichoptera_, or May-flies,\r\nas _Phryganea grandis_ L., exclude their eggs in a double packet,\r\nenveloped in a mass of jelly, (a circumstance often attending the\r\neggs that produce aquatic larvæ,) upon the leaves of willows[95].\r\nA similar double packet in the year 1810 I observed appended to\r\nthe anus of a black species with long antennæ, probably _Phryganea\r\natrata_ F.[96] Upon taking several of the females I was surprised to\r\nfind in the above situation a seemingly fleshy substance of a dirty\r\nyellow. At first, from its annular appearance, I conceived it to be\r\nsome parasitic larva, but was not a little surprised upon pulling\r\nit away that it was full of globular transparent dusky eggs: it was\r\nabout two lines and a quarter in length and nearly one in breadth.\r\nBeing bent double it was attached to the animal by the intermediate\r\nangle, and when unfolded was constricted in the middle[97]. Each\r\nhalf, which was roundish, had about ten sharp transverse ridges, the\r\ninterstices of which appeared as if crenated, an appearance produced\r\nby the eggs which it contained. Upon more than gentle pressure it\r\nburst and let out the eggs. Though resembling the packet of _P.\r\ngrandis_ in shape and other circumstances, it was nothing like\r\njelly, but had rather a waxy appearance, and seems to have been\r\ncovered by a membrane: so that the excluded larvæ must probably have\r\neaten their way out of it. I have still by me, in 1822, specimens of\r\nthese egg-packets, which, after the lapse of so many years, retain\r\ntheir original form and colour. It is not improbable that other\r\nspecies extrude their eggs in a similar case. Scopoli says of _P.\r\nbicaudata_ L., that the female carries about under her belly her eggs\r\nunited into a globe, like _Lycosa saccata_[98]. The eggs of _Geometra\r\nPotamogata_ F. are also enveloped in a gelatinous substance, and the\r\nmass is covered with leaves[99].\r\n\r\nInsects of the _Diptera_ order also, like frogs and toads, commit\r\ntheir eggs to the water imbedded in masses of jelly. Dr. Derham\r\ndescribes two different kinds of them, in one of which the eggs were\r\nlaid in parallel rows end to end, and in another in a single row,\r\nin which the sides were parallel[100]. But the most remarkable and\r\nbeautiful specimen of this kind that I ever saw was one that, many\r\nyears ago, I took out of a pond at Wittersham in Kent, from which I\r\nrequested a young lady to make the drawing I send you[101]. The mass\r\nof jelly, about an inch and a quarter long, and rather widest in the\r\nmiddle, was attached by one end to some aquatic grass, and from one\r\nend to the other ran a spiral thread of very minute eggs, the turns\r\nof the screw being alternately on each side.\r\n\r\nThe mode of exclusion of the eggs of the _Blattæ_, which are engaged\r\nfor a whole week in the business of oviposition, is very singular:\r\nthe female deposits one or two large suboviform capsules, as large as\r\nhalf their abdomen, rounded on one side, and on the other straight\r\nand serrated, which at first is white and soft, but soon becomes\r\nbrown and hard. This egg-case, as it may be called, contains sixteen\r\nor eighteen eggs arranged in a double series, and the cock-roaches\r\nwhen hatched make their escape through a cleft in its straight\r\nside, which shuts so accurately when they have quitted it, that at\r\nfirst it appears as entire as before[102]. The insects of the genus\r\n_Mantis_ also, or what are called the _praying insects_, when they\r\ndeposit their eggs, eject with them a soft substance, which hardens\r\nin the air and forms a long kind of envelope resembling parchment,\r\nin which the eggs are arranged also in a double series. And the\r\nLocusts (_Gryllus Locusta_ L.) are said by Morier[103] to deposit in\r\nthe ground an oblong substance, of the shape of their abdomen, which\r\ncontains a considerable number of eggs arranged neatly in rows. The\r\nperistaltic motion observed in the females of some insects during\r\noviposition has been before described[104].\r\n\r\n\r\nii. _Situation._ Under this head I include the situation in which the\r\nfemale insect places her eggs when extruded, whether she continues her\r\ncare of them and carries them about till they hatch, or whether she\r\nentirely deserts them, placing them either without a covering within\r\nreach of their food, or enveloping them in hair or otherwise protecting\r\nthem from accident or the attack of enemies. I shall consider them\r\nunder two views: _first_, as depositing their eggs in _groups_, whether\r\ncovered or naked; and _secondly_, as depositing them _singly_.\r\n\r\n1. Those that deposit their eggs in _groups_ are first to be\r\nconsidered. I shall begin with those that protect them with some kind\r\nof _covering_.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned in a former letter[105] the silken bag with\r\nwhich _Lycosa saccata_ Latr., a kind of spider, surrounds her eggs, and\r\nin which she constantly carries them about with her, defending them to\r\nthe last extremity. Many other spiders, indeed nearly the whole tribe,\r\nfabricate similar pouches, but of various sizes, forms, texture, and\r\ncolours. Some are scarcely so big as a pea, others of the size of a\r\nlarge gooseberry; some globular, some bell-shaped; others, the genus\r\n_Thomisus_ Walck. in particular, depressed like a lupine; some of a\r\nclose texture like silk; others of a looser fabric resembling wool:\r\nsome consisting of a single pellicle, but most of a double, of which\r\nthe interior is finer and softer[106]; some white; others inclining\r\nto blue; others again yellow or reddish; most of them are of a whole\r\ncolour, but that of _Epeira fasciata_ is gray varied with black[107].\r\nAnd while the parent spider of some kinds (the _Lupi_) always carries\r\nher egg-bag attached to her anus, others hold them by their palpi and\r\nmaxillæ; and others suspend them by a long thread, or simply fasten\r\nthem in different situations, either constantly remaining near them\r\n(the _Telariæ_), or wholly deserting them (the _Retiariæ_). The eggs of\r\none of these last Lister describes as often fixed in a very singular\r\nsituation--the cavity at the end of a ripe cherry; and thus, as he\r\nexpresses it--\"_Stomachi maxime delicatuli quoties hanc innocuam buccam\r\nnon minus ignoranter quam avide devorarunt_[108].\"\r\n\r\nHerman informs us, that the species of the genus _Chelifer_ carry\r\ntheir eggs in a mass under their belly[109].\r\n\r\nMadam Merian gives an account of two species of _Blatta_, which\r\nshe affirms carry an egg-pouch about with them--one species (_B.\r\ngigantea?_) she describes as carrying its eggs in a globular pouch of\r\nweb like certain spiders, and the other in a brown bag, which, when\r\nalarmed, it drops and makes off[110]. But this admirable paintress of\r\nnatural objects was not always correct in her statements[111]: it seems\r\nvery improbable, from the habits of those species of which we know the\r\nhistory, that any of them should spin a pouch of web for their eggs.\r\n\r\nThe only insects certainly known to spin an egg-pouch like the\r\nspiders, are the _Hydrophili_, a kind of water-beetles. Some of\r\nthese, as _H. lividus_, carry them about with them, like _Lycosa\r\nsaccata_, attached to the under side of their body, as M. Miger\r\nobserved[112]; and others when they are finished desert them. That of\r\nthe great water-beetle (_Hydrophilus piceus_) was long ago described\r\nand figured by Lyonnet[113]; and a more detailed account of it has\r\nsince been given by M. Miger[114]. In form it somewhat resembles a\r\nturnip when reversed, since it consists of a pouch of the shape of\r\nan oblate spheroid, the great diameter of which is three quarters\r\nof an inch; and the small, half an inch, from which rises a curved\r\nhorn, about an inch long and terminating in a point[115]. The animal\r\nis furnished with a pair of anal spinners, which move from right to\r\nleft, and up and down, with much quickness and agility: from these\r\nspinners a white and glutinous fluid appears to issue, that forms\r\nthe pouch, which it takes the animal about three hours to construct.\r\nThe exterior tissue is produced by a kind of liquid and glutinous\r\npaste, which by desiccation becomes a flexible covering impermeable\r\nto water; the second, which envelops the eggs, is a kind of light\r\ndown of great whiteness, that keeps them from injuring each other.\r\nThe tissue of the horn is of a silky nature, porous and shining, and\r\ngreatly resembling the cocoons of _Lepidoptera_. This part, contrary\r\nto what Lyonnet supposes, appears calculated to admit the air, the\r\nwater soon penetrating it when submerged. At its base is the opening\r\nprepared for the egress of the larvæ, when hatched, which is closed\r\nby some threads, that, by means of the air confined in the cocoon or\r\npouch, hinder the water from getting in[116]. This nidus does not\r\nfloat at liberty in the water till after the eggs are hatched, the\r\nparent animal always attaching it to some plant. By means of this\r\nanomalous process for a beetle, which this insect is instructed by\r\nProvidence thus to perfect, the precious contents of its little ark\r\nare secured from the action of the element which is to be the theatre\r\nof their first state of existence, from the voracity of fishes, or\r\nthe more rapacious larvæ of its own tribe, until the included eggs\r\nare hatched, and emerge from their curious cradle.\r\n\r\nI shall next amuse you with a few instances, in which the Allwise\r\nCreator instructs the parent insect, instead of defending her eggs\r\nwith a covering furnished by her internal organs, to provide it from\r\nwithout, either from her own body or from some other substance.\r\nMost commonly, indeed, the female leaves her cluster of eggs without\r\nany other covering than the varnish with which in this case they are\r\nusually besmeared. Either they are deposited in summer and will soon be\r\nhatched, or they are of a substance calculated to encounter and resist\r\nthe severities of the season. But many species, whose eggs are more\r\ntender or have to resist the cold and wet of winter, defend them in the\r\nmost ingenious manner with a clothing of different kinds of substance.\r\n\r\n_Cassida viridis_, a tortoise beetle, Rösel tells us, covers her\r\ngroup of eggs with a partially transparent membrane. _Arctia Salicis_\r\nF., a moth, common on willows, wholly conceals hers with a white\r\nfrothy substance, which when dry is partly friable and partly\r\ncottony, and being insoluble in water effectually protects them from\r\nthe weather[117]. The female of _Lophyrus Pini_ (a saw-fly), having\r\nby means of her double saw made a suitable longitudinal incision\r\nin the leaf of a fir, and placed in it her eggs in a single row\r\nend to end, stops it up with a green frothy fluid mixed with the\r\nsmall pieces of leaf detached by her saws, which when dry becomes\r\nfriable: a necessary precaution, since these eggs are extremely\r\nbrittle[118]. _Arctia chrysorhœa_, _Hypogymna dispar_, and several\r\nother moths, surround theirs with an equally impervious and more\r\nsingular clothing--_hair_ stripped from their own bodies. With this\r\nmaterial, which they pluck by means of their pincer-like ovipositor,\r\nthey first form a soft couch on the surface of some leaf: they then\r\nplace upon it successively layers of eggs, and surround them with a\r\nsimilar downy coating, and when the whole number is deposited cover\r\nthe surface with a roof of hairs, which cannot be too much admired;\r\nfor those used for the interior of the nest are placed without order,\r\nbut those employed externally are arranged with as much art and skill\r\nas the tiles of a roof, and as effectually keep out the water, one\r\nlayer resting partly on the other, and all having the same direction,\r\nso that the whole resembles a well-brushed piece of shaggy cloth or\r\nfur. When the mother has finished this labour, which often occupies\r\nher for twenty-four hours, and sometimes even twice that period, her\r\nbody, which before was extremely hairy, is almost wholly naked--she\r\nhas stripped herself to supply clothing to her offspring, and\r\nhaving performed this last duty she expires. The female moths which\r\nthus protect their eggs are often furnished with an extraordinary\r\nquantity of hair about the anus for this express purpose; and Reaumur\r\nconjectures, that the singular anal patch of scales resembling those\r\nof the wings, but considerably larger, which is found in the female\r\nof _Lasiocampa Pityocampa_, is destined for the same purpose[119].\r\n\r\nReaumur had once brought to him a nidus of eggs clothed still more\r\ncuriously: they surrounded a twig in a spiral direction, like those\r\nof _Lasiocampa Neustria_, but were much more numerous, and were\r\nthickly covered with fine down, not pressed close, but standing off\r\nhorizontally, which assumed much the same appearance as a fox's tail\r\nwould if twisted spirally round a branch[120].\r\n\r\nA procedure nearly similar was observed by De Geer in some species of\r\nAphides (_A. Alni_ and _A. Pruni_), which covered their eggs with a\r\nwhite cottony down detached from their belly by means of their hind\r\nlegs[121]. In this case, however, the eggs were separately coated\r\nwith the down, but there was no general covering to the group.\r\n\r\nSeveral insects make the leaves and other parts of plants serve as\r\ncoverings for their eggs. _Tenthredo Rosæ_ L., a saw-fly, and other\r\nspecies of the same genus, with their saws make an incision in the\r\ngreen twigs of shrubs and trees, and fill it with a line of eggs\r\nplaced end to end, taking care that, as the eggs grow after they are\r\nlaid, they are placed at such distances as to leave room for their\r\nexpansion[122]. _Rhynchites Bacchus_, a brilliant weevil, well known\r\nto the vine-dressers for the injury it does[123], rolls with much art\r\nthe leaves of the vine, so as to form a cavity, in which it places\r\nits eggs; other species practise similar manœuvres; and some probably\r\nplace their young progeny in the interior of twigs, making an opening\r\nfor that purpose with their rostrum--at least, I once saw _Rhynchites\r\nAlliariæ_ L. with its rostrum plunged up to the antennæ in the twig of\r\na crab-tree. Others of this tribe, as we know, place their eggs in the\r\ninterior of fruits and grain, as the nut, acorn, and common weevils.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that most of the above coverings serve another\r\npurpose besides the protection of the eggs from wet and cold--that\r\nof sheltering them from the action of too great light, which, as Dr.\r\nMichellotti by numerous experiments has ascertained, is fatal to\r\nthe included germe[124]. On this account it is perhaps that so many\r\ninsects fasten their eggs to the under side of leaves. Those exposed\r\nin full day have usually an opaque and horny texture.\r\n\r\nSome insects are spared all trouble in providing a covering for their\r\neggs, their own bodies furnishing one in every respect adapted to\r\nthis purpose. Not to mention the _Onisci_, or wood-lice, since they\r\nrather belong to the _Crustacea_, which have a four-valved cell under\r\nthe breast, in which they carry their eggs, as the kangaroo does\r\nits young in its abdominal pouch, the whole body of the female of\r\nthose strange animals the _Cocci_ becomes a covering for her eggs,\r\nwhich it incloses on every side. To make this intelligible to you,\r\nfurther explanation is necessary. You must have noticed those singular\r\nimmovable tortoise-shaped insects, which are such pests to myrtles and\r\nother greenhouse plants. These are the young of a species of _Coccus_\r\n(_C. Hesperidum_ L.), and _their_ history is that of the whole race.\r\nPart of them never become much bigger than the size of which you\r\nordinarily see them, and when full-grown disclose minute two-winged\r\nflies, which are the males. The size of the females, which glue\r\nthemselves to a twig or leaf as if lifeless, now augments prodigiously,\r\nand the whole body, distended with the thousands of eggs which it\r\nincludes to the bigness of a large pea, without any vestige of head or\r\nlimb, resembles a vegetable excrescence or gall-apple rather than an\r\ninsect. If you remove one of them, you will perceive that the under\r\npart of its abdomen is flat and closely applied to the surface of the\r\nbranch on which it rests, only a thin layer of a sort of cotton being\r\ninterposed between them. In laying her eggs the female _Coccus_ does\r\nnot, like most insects, protrude them beyond her body into day-light;\r\nbut as soon as the first egg has passed the orifice of her oviduct,\r\nshe pushes it between her belly and the cottony stratum just mentioned,\r\nand the succeeding eggs are deposited in the same manner until the\r\nwhole are excluded. You will ask how there can be found space between\r\nthe insect's belly and the cotton, to which at first it was closely\r\napplied, for so large a mass of eggs? To comprehend this, you must\r\nconsider that nearly the whole contents of its abdomen were eggs; that\r\nin proportion as these are extruded a void space is left, which allows\r\nthe skin of the under side of the body to be pushed upwards, or towards\r\nthat of the back, affording room between it and the cottony web for\r\ntheir convenient stowage. If you examine the insect after its eggs are\r\nall laid, you will find that they have merely changed their situation;\r\ninstead of being on the upper side of the skin forming the belly, and\r\nwithin the body, they now are placed between it (now become concave\r\nand nearly touching the back) and the layer of cotton. As soon as the\r\nfemale _Coccus_ has finished her singular operation she dies; but her\r\nbody, retaining its shape, remains glued upon the eggs, to which it\r\nforms an arched covering, effectually protecting them, until they are\r\nhatched, from every external injury. Some species lay so many eggs,\r\nthat the abdomen is not sufficiently large to cover the whole mass,\r\nbut merely one side of it, the remainder being enveloped in cottony\r\nweb[125].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am next to consider the situation of those eggs that are excluded\r\nby the mother in groups _without any_ other _covering_ than the\r\nvarnish with which they are usually besmeared in their passage from\r\nthe oviduct. The females only place them upon or near the food\r\nappropriated to the young larvæ, to which they adhere by means of\r\nthe varnish just mentioned. These groups consist of a greater or\r\nless number; and when the eggs are hatched by the heat of the sun,\r\nthe larvæ begin to disperse and attack with voracity the food that\r\nsurrounds them. It is thus that most butterflies and moths attach\r\ntheir eggs to the stems, twigs, and leaves of plants; that the lady\r\nbirds (_Coccinellæ_), the aphidivorous flies (_Syrphi_ &c.), and\r\nthe lace-winged flies (_Hemerobii_), deposit them in the midst of\r\nplant-lice (_Aphides_); that the eggs of some flesh-flies are gummed\r\nupon flesh; those of crickets and grasshoppers buried in the earth;\r\nthose of gnats and other Tipulidans set afloat upon, or submerged in,\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nFrequently the whole number of eggs laid by one female is placed in\r\none large group, more commonly, however, in several smaller ones,\r\neither at a distance from each other on the same plant, or on distinct\r\nplants. The object in the latter case seems to be, in some instances,\r\nto avoid crowding too many guests at one table, in others to protect\r\nthe unhatched eggs from the voracity of the larvæ first excluded, which\r\nwould often devour them if in their immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIn the disposition of the eggs which compose these groups much\r\ndiversity prevails. Sometimes they are placed without order in\r\na confused mass: more frequently, however, they are arranged\r\nin different, and often in very beautiful modes. The common\r\ncabbage-butterfly (_Pieris Brassicæ_) and many other insects place\r\ntheirs upon one end, side by side, so as, comparing small things with\r\ngreat, to resemble a close column of soldiers, in consequence of which\r\nthose larvæ which, on hatching, proceed from the upper end, cannot\r\ndisturb the adjoining eggs. Many indeed have a conformation purposely\r\nadapted to this position, as the hemisphærical eggs of the puss-moth\r\n(_Cerura Vinula_), which have the base by which they are gummed\r\nmembranous and transparent, while the rest is corneous and opaque. The\r\nsame ready exit to the larva is provided for in the oblong eggs of the\r\nemperor moth (_Saturnia Pavonia_), which are piled on their sides in\r\ntwo or more lines like bottles of wine in a bin[126].\r\n\r\nWhere the larva does not emerge exactly from the end of the egg other\r\narrangements take place. The whirlwig-beetle (_Gyrinus natator_) and\r\nthe saw-fly of the gooseberry &c. (_Tenthredo flava_ L.) dispose\r\ntheirs end to end in several rows; the former upon the leaf of some\r\naquatic grass, the rows being parallel[127], the latter gummed to the\r\nmain nerves of gooseberry or currant leaves, the direction of which\r\nthey follow[128].\r\n\r\nBut the lackey-moths (_Lasiocampa Neustria_, _castrensis_, &c.)\r\nadopt a different procedure. As their eggs, which are laid in the\r\nautumn, are not to be hatched until the spring, the female does not,\r\nlike most other moths, place them upon a leaf, with which they might\r\nbe blown by the winter's storms far from their destined food, but\r\nupon the twig of some tree, round which she ranges them in numerous\r\ncircles. If you examine your fruit-trees, you can scarcely fail\r\nto find upon the young twigs collections of these eggs, which are\r\ndisposed with such admirable art, that you would take them rather\r\nfor pearls, set by the skilful hand of a jeweller, than for the eggs\r\nof an insect. Each of these bracelets, as the French gardeners\r\naptly call them, is composed of from 200 to 300 pyramidal eggs\r\nwith flattened tops[129], having their axes perpendicular to the\r\ncircumference of the twig to which they are fastened, surrounding it\r\nin a series of from fifteen to seventeen close spiral circles, and\r\nhaving their interstices filled up with a tenacious brown gum, which,\r\nwhile it secures them alike from the wintry blast and the attack\r\nof voracious insects, serves as a foil to the white enamel of the\r\neggs that it encompasses. It is not easy to conceive how these moths\r\ncontrive to accomplish so accurately with their tail and hind feet an\r\narrangement which would require nicety from the hands of an artist;\r\nnor could Reaumur, with all his efforts and by any contrivance,\r\nsatisfy himself upon this head. He bred numbers of the fly from the\r\negg, and supplied the females after impregnation with appropriate\r\ntwigs; but these, as though resolved that imprisonment should not\r\nforce from them the secret of their art, laid their eggs at random,\r\nand made no attempt to place them symmetrically[130].\r\n\r\nThis illustrious Entomologist was more successful in discovering\r\nthe mode in which another insect, the common _gnat_, whose group of\r\neggs is, in some respects, as extraordinary as that last described,\r\nperforms its operations. The eggs of this insect, of a long\r\nphial-like form, are glued together, side by side, to the number of\r\nfrom 250 to 300, into an oblong mass, pointed and more elevated at\r\neach end, so as considerably to resemble a little boat in shape.\r\nYou must not here suppose that I use the term _boat_ by way of\r\nillustration merely; for it has all the essential properties of a\r\nboat. In shape it pretty accurately resembles a London wherry, being\r\nsharp and higher, to use a nautical phrase, fore and aft; convex\r\nbelow and concave above; floating, moreover, constantly on the keel\r\nor convex part. But this is not all. It is besides a _life-boat_,\r\nmore buoyant than even Mr. Greathead's: the most violent agitation\r\nof the water cannot sink it; and what is more extraordinary, and a\r\nproperty still a desideratum in our life-boats, though hollow it\r\nnever becomes filled with water, even though exposed to the torrents\r\nthat often accompany a thunder-storm. To put this to the test, I\r\nyesterday (July 25, 1811) placed half a dozen of these boats upon the\r\nsurface of a tumbler half full of water; I then poured upon them a\r\nstream of that element from the mouth of a quart bottle held a foot\r\nabove them. Yet after this treatment, which was so rough as actually\r\nto project one out of the glass, I found them floating as before upon\r\ntheir bottoms, and not a drop of water within their cavity.\r\n\r\nThis boat, which floats upon the surface of the water until the\r\nlarvæ are disclosed, is placed there by the female gnat. But how?\r\nHer eggs, as in other insects, are extruded one by one. They are so\r\nsmall at the base in proportion to their length that it would be\r\ndifficult to make them stand singly upright on a solid surface, much\r\nmore on the water. How then does the gnat contrive to support the\r\nfirst egg perpendicularly until she has glued another to it--these\r\ntwo until she has fixed a third, and so on until a sufficient number\r\nis fastened together to form a base capable of sustaining them in\r\ntheir perpendicular position? This is her process. She fixes her four\r\nanterior legs upon a piece of leaf, or a blade of grass, and projects\r\nher tail over the water. She then crosses her two hind legs, and in\r\nthe inner angle which they form, retains and supports the first laid\r\negg, as it proceeds from the anus. In like manner she also supports\r\nthe second, third, &c., all of which adhere to each other by means of\r\ntheir glutinous coating, until she feels that a sufficient number are\r\nunited to give a stable base to her little bark; she then uncrosses\r\nher legs, and merely employs them to retain the mass until it is of\r\nthe required size and shape, when she flies away, and leaves it to\r\nits fate floating upon the water[131].\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to mention here a remarkable circumstance\r\nwhich not seldom attends a kind of water-scorpion (_Naucoris_ F.)\r\noccasionally to be met with in collections of Chinese insects. Its\r\nback is often covered with a group of rather large eggs, closely\r\narranged; but whether these are its own eggs or those of some large\r\nspecies of water-mite (_Hydrachna_ Maïll.) has not been clearly\r\nascertained. On the former supposition, the ovipositor must be\r\nremarkably long and flexile to enable the animal to place the eggs\r\non its back. In confirmation of the latter it may be observed, that\r\nthe species of the genus _Hydrachna_ usually attach their eggs to the\r\nbody and legs of aquatic insects, as for instance _H. abstergens_ to\r\nthe water-scorpion (_Nepa cinerea_), &c.[132]\r\n\r\n2. After having thus laid before you some of the procedures of those\r\ninsects that usually deposit their eggs in groups, either naked or\r\ndefended by coverings of various kinds, I next proceed to a rapid\r\nsurvey of those of the species that commonly deposit them _singly_.\r\nSome of these, as for instance the Admiral Butterfly (_Vanessa\r\nAtalanta_), glue each egg carefully to its destined leaf by alighting\r\non it for a moment. Another butterfly (_Hipparchia Hyperanthus_)\r\nwhose caterpillar is polyphagous, drops hers at random on different\r\nplants. In general it may be observed, that all those larvæ which\r\nlive in solitude, as in the interior of wood, leaves, fruits, grain,\r\nanimals, &c., proceed from eggs laid singly by the female, which\r\nis usually provided with an appropriate instrument for depositing\r\nthem in their proper situation. Thus the nut-weevil (_Balaninus\r\nNucum_ Germ.) and also that of the acorn (_B. Glandium_) pierce a\r\nnut or an acorn with their long beak, and then deposit in the hole\r\nan egg, from which proceeds the maggot that destroys those fruits.\r\nLeeuwenhoek asserts that the common weevil (_Calandra granaria_)\r\nadopts the same process, boring a hole in every single grain of\r\ncorn before it commits an egg to it, and at the same time, by this\r\nmanœuvre, prepares a small quantity of flour to serve for the food\r\nof the tender grub when it is first hatched[133]. It is probable\r\nthat the Rhyncophorous or weevil tribe in general chiefly use their\r\nbeaks for the purpose of depositing their eggs in different vegetable\r\nsubstances, and perhaps principally in fruit or grain. The tribe of\r\ngall-flies (_Cynips_) on the contrary, whose economy, detailed in a\r\nformer letter[134], interested you so much, bore an opening for the\r\negg with their spiral oviduct, which also conveys it.\r\n\r\nAnother large tribe of insects depositing their eggs singly, are those\r\nwhich feed upon the bodies of other animals, into the flesh of which\r\nthey are either inserted, or placed so as speedily to find their way\r\ninto it. Some of these introduce them into _living_ animals, and then\r\nleave them to their fate, as the _Ichneumons_ and gad-flies: others\r\ndeposit them along with the _dead_ body of an insect interred in a\r\nhole, often prepared with great labour, as the different species of\r\nsand-wasps (_Sphecidæ_), spider-wasps (_Pompilidæ_), &c.: the manners\r\nof the latter of these tribes have been already adverted to[135], and\r\nthose of the _Ichneumonidæ_ will come more fully under consideration\r\nwhen I treat of the _diseases_ of insects.\r\n\r\nA similar labour in providing suitable habitations for their eggs\r\nis undergone by various other insects whose larvæ live chiefly on\r\nvegetable food, some inserting their egg within the substance the\r\nlarva devours, as those that prey on timber, twigs, roots, or the\r\nlike, and others on its surface. One would suppose at first, that the\r\nexceedingly small egg which produces the subcutaneous larvæ would, by\r\nthe parent moth, be imbedded in the substance of the leaf which is\r\nto exhibit hereafter their serpentine galleries: but this is not the\r\ncase, for she merely glues it on the outside; at least such was the\r\nsituation of the only egg of these very minute moths Reaumur had ever\r\nan opportunity to observe[136].\r\n\r\nOther insects, belonging to the tribe which lay their eggs singly, bury\r\nthem in the ground. Of this description are many of the lamellicorn\r\ninsects, the dung-chafers (_Scarabæidæ_ MacLeay) particularly, which,\r\ninclosing their eggs in a pellet of dung, deposit them in deep\r\ncylindrical cavities. Concerning the proceedings of some of these, as\r\nwell as of the whole race of bees, wasps, &c., which all lay single\r\neggs, I have before detailed to you many interesting particulars[137].\r\nI must not conclude this subject without observing, that the female\r\n_Pycnogonidæ_, an osculant tribe between Insects and _Crustacea_, carry\r\ntheir eggs upon two pair of false legs[138].\r\n\r\n\r\niii. _Substance._ From this long dissertation on the _situation_\r\nof the eggs of insects and matters connected with it, I pass on to\r\ntheir _substance_ or their external and internal composition, giving\r\nat the same time some account of the embryo included in them. The\r\neggs of insects, like those of birds, consist in the first place\r\nof an external coat or shell, varying greatly, as to substance, in\r\ndifferent genera. Most commonly, particularly in those which deposit\r\ntheir eggs in moist situations, as in dung, earth, and the like, it\r\nis a mere membrane, often thin and transparent, and showing, as in\r\nspiders, all the changes that take place in the inclosed embryo,\r\nas the formation of the head, trunk, and limbs[139]. This membrane\r\nis sometimes so delicate as to yield to the slightest pressure,\r\nand insufficient to protect the included fluids from too rapid\r\nan evaporation, if the eggs be exposed to the full action of the\r\natmosphere. In most _Lepidoptera_, and several other tribes, this\r\nintegument is considerably stronger, in those moths whose eggs are\r\nexposed throughout the winter, as _Lasiocampa Neustria_, &c., so\r\nhard as not to yield easily to the knife. Even in these, however,\r\nits substance is more analogous to horn or a stiff membrane than\r\nto the shell of the eggs of birds. Nothing calcareous enters into\r\nits composition, and it is not perceptibly acted upon by diluted\r\nsulphuric acid. The eggs of birds are lined by a fine membrane; but\r\nI have examined several of those of insects, and have been able to\r\ndiscover nothing of the kind in them. I will not, however, affirm\r\nthat it does not exist, though the shell of the insect egg appears\r\nmore analogous to the membrane that lines that of the bird than to\r\nthe outside shell itself.\r\n\r\nWithin this integument is included a fluid, on the precise nature\r\nof which, except that it is an aqueous whitish fluid, few or no\r\nobservations have been made, or indeed are practicable; but it is\r\nreasonable to suppose, that like the white and yolk of the bird's\r\negg, it serves for the development of the organs of the germe of the\r\nfuture insect.\r\n\r\nBut few observations are recorded that relate to the embryo included\r\nin the egg. It is stated, that it is invested with an extremely fine\r\nand delicate pellicle--supposed by some analogous to the _Chorion_\r\nand _Amnios_ of the human fœtus, though others think the shell of the\r\negg to correspond with the _Chorion_, and the successive integuments\r\nof the larva with the _Amnios_[140]. When the egg is first laid,\r\nnothing indeed is to be seen in it but the fluid just mentioned;\r\nthe first change in this fluid is the appearance of the head of\r\nthe embryo, more particularly in _Coleoptera_, of two points, the\r\nrudiments of the mandibles, and of those apertures into the tracheæ\r\nwhich I have called spiracles[141]; the little animal we may suppose\r\nthen assumes its form and limbs. The embryo is usually so folded in\r\nthe egg that the head and tail meet[142], and the head, annuli, and\r\nother parts of the larva are often visible through the shell[143].\r\nSwammerdam even saw the pulsation of the great dorsal vessel through\r\nthe shell of the egg of _Oryctes nasicornis_.\r\n\r\nUnder this head I must notice another singular circumstance peculiar\r\nI believe to the eggs of insects, that sometimes, though rarely, they\r\nare covered with down or hair. Those of a singular little hemipterous\r\ninsect, of a genus I believe at present undescribed, the ravages\r\nof which upon the larch have been before noticed[144], are covered\r\nby a downy web, as is the case with the animal itself. De Geer has\r\ndescribed the eggs of a bug, not uncommon in this country (_Pentatoma\r\njuniperina_ Latr.), which are reticulated with black veins, in which\r\nvery short bristles are planted[145]. I possess also a nest of brown\r\neggs, probably of a species of the same genus, found upon furze,\r\nwhich appear to be covered with very short downy hairs. The top of\r\nthese is flat, and surrounded by a coronet of short bristles, each\r\nsurmounted by a small white ball, so as to wear the appearance of\r\na beautiful little _Mucor_. But hairy eggs are not confined to the\r\nHemiptera Order, for, according to Sepp, those of the figure-of-eight\r\nmoth (_Bombyx cæruleocephala_) are of this description[146].\r\n\r\n\r\niv. _Number._ The fertility of insects far exceeds that of birds,\r\nand is surpassed only by that of fishes[147]. But the number of\r\neggs laid by different species, sometimes even of the same natural\r\nfamily, is extremely various. Thus the pupiparous insects may be\r\nregarded as producing only a single egg; _Musca Meridiana_ L., a\r\ncommon fly, lays two[148], other flies six or eight; the flea twelve;\r\nthe burying beetle (_Necrophorus Vespillo_[149]) thirty; May-flies\r\n(_Trichoptera_ K.) under a hundred; the silk-worm moth about 500;\r\nthe great goat-moth(_Cossus ligniperda_) 1,000; _Acarus americanus_\r\nmore than 1,000[150]; the tiger-moth (_Callimorpha Caja_) 1,600; some\r\nCocci 2,000, others 4,000; the female wasp at least 30,000[151];\r\nthe queen bee varies considerably in the number of eggs that she\r\nproduces in one season, in some cases it may amount to 40,000 or\r\n50,000 or more[152]; a small hemipterous insect, resembling a little\r\nmoth (_Aleyrodes proletella_ Latr.) 200,000. But all these are left\r\nfar behind by one of the white ants (_Termes fatale_ F. _bellicosus_\r\nSmeath.)--the female of this insect, as was before observed[153],\r\nextruding from her enormous matrix not less than 60 eggs in a minute,\r\nwhich gives 3,600 in an hour, 86,400 in a day, 2,419,200 in a lunar\r\nmonth, and the enormous number of 211,449,600 in a year: probably she\r\ndoes not always continue laying at this rate; but if the sum be set\r\nas low as possible, it will exceed that produced by any other known\r\nanimal in the creation.\r\n\r\n\r\nv. _Size._ The size of the eggs is in proportion to that of the\r\ninsect producing them, though in some instances small ones produce\r\nlarger eggs than those laid by bigger species. Thus the eggs of\r\nmany _Aptera_, as those of that singular mite _Uropoda vegetans_,\r\nand of the bird-louse found in the golden pheasant, are nearly as\r\nlarge, it is probable, as the parent insect; while those of the\r\nghost-moth (_Hepialus Humuli_) and many other _Lepidoptera_, &c.\r\nare vastly smaller. This circumstance perhaps depends principally\r\non the number they produce: the majority of them, however, are\r\nsmall. The largest egg known, if it be not rather an egg-case,\r\nis that of a spectre insect (_Phasma dilatatum_), figured in the\r\nLinnean Transactions[154], being five lines in length and three\r\nin width, which probably approaches near the size of that of some\r\nhumming-birds. The largest egg of any British insect I ever saw was\r\nthat of the common black rove-beetle (_Staphylinus olens_) sent me by\r\nMr. Sheppard--this is a line and half long by a line in width. But\r\nwe do not often meet with insect-eggs exceeding a line in length. A\r\nvast number are much smaller: those of Ephemeræ are more minute than\r\nthe smallest grains of sand[155], and some almost imperceptible, as\r\nthose of the subcutaneous moths, to the naked eye. Commonly the eggs\r\nlaid by one female are all of the same size; but in several tribes,\r\nthose containing the germe of the _female_ are larger than those that\r\nare to give birth to a _male_. This appears to be the case with those\r\nof the Rhinoceros beetle (_Oryctes nasicornis_[156]), and according\r\nto Gould with those of ants[157]. As the female in a vast number\r\nof instances is much bigger than the male, it is not improbable\r\nthat this law may hold very extensively. It is stated, however, by\r\nReaumur[158], that the reverse of this takes place in the eggs of the\r\nhive-bee, those that are to produce males being larger than the rest.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity connected with the present head is the\r\naugmentation in bulk which takes place, after exclusion, in the eggs\r\nof the great tribe of saw-flies (_Tenthredo_ L.), the gall-flies\r\n(_Cynips_ L.), the ants (_Formica_ L.) and the water-mites\r\n(_Hydrachna_ Maïll. _Atax_ F.). Those of the two former, which are\r\nusually deposited in the parenchymous substance of the leaves, or of\r\nthe young twigs, of various plants, imbibe nutriment in some unknown\r\nmanner, through their membranous skins, from the vegetable juices\r\nwhich surround them[159], and when they have attained their full size\r\nare nearly twice as large as when first laid. Except in the eggs of\r\nfishes, whose volume in like manner is said to augment previously\r\nto the extrusion of the young, there is nothing analogous to this\r\nsingular fact in any other of the oviparous tribes of animals, the\r\neggs of which have always attained their full size when they are laid.\r\n\r\nIt is to M. P. Huber that we are indebted for the knowledge of the\r\nfact that the eggs of _ants_ grow after being laid, a circumstance\r\nfavoured probably by the moist situation in which the workers are\r\nalways careful to keep them. By an accurate admeasurement he found\r\nthat those nearly ready to be hatched were almost twice as big\r\nas those just laid[160]. A similar observation was made on the\r\nred eggs of a water-mite (_Hydrachna abstergens_) by Rösel, who\r\nconjectured that they draw their means of increase from the body of\r\nthe water-scorpions (_Nepæ_), of which they form so singular an\r\nappendage[161], which opinion is confirmed by De Geer, who observes\r\nthat when the water-scorpions are covered by an unusual number of the\r\neggs of the water-mites, they grow weak and languid, and endeavour\r\nto rid themselves of their parasitic appendages[162]. It is most\r\nprobable that the mite lately named (_Uropoda vegetans_), which is\r\noften found planted as it were upon the bodies of various beetles, by\r\nmeans of a long pedicle, through which, as the fœtus by an umbilical\r\nchord and placenta, it derives its nutriment from the above animals,\r\nis at first so fixed in the egg state, though before it is disengaged\r\nfrom the pedicle it is hatched, since it is often found with its legs\r\ndisplayed and quite active--this is the more probable, as the eggs of\r\nthe water-mite are fixed by a pedicle to the animals to which they\r\nare attached[163]. I have met with a remarkable instance, in which\r\npedunculated eggs seem to draw nutriment from the _mother_, which\r\nbrings the pedicle still near to the nature of the umbilical chord.\r\nThose of the small hemipterous insect which infests the larch before\r\nalluded to, are attached to the anal end of the mother by a short\r\nfoot-stalk not longer than the egg.\r\n\r\nDr. Derham seems to have observed, that the eggs of some _Diptera_,\r\nof the tribe of _Tipulidæ_, also increase in size before the larva\r\nis excluded[164]. It seems to me likely enough, that in this and\r\nmany of the above cases in which the egg is supposed to grow, it is\r\nrather an extension of the flexile membrane that forms their exterior\r\nproportioned to the growth of the included embryo from food it finds\r\nwithin the egg, than from any absorption from without.\r\n\r\n\r\nvi. _Shape._ We are accustomed to see the eggs of different species\r\nof oviparous animals so nearly resembling each other in form, that\r\nthe very term _egg-shaped_ has been appropriated to a particular\r\nfigure. Amongst those of birds, with which we are most familiar,\r\nthe sole variations are shades of difference between a globular and\r\noval or ovate figure. The eggs of insects, however, are confined by\r\nno such limited model. They differ often as much, both as to their\r\nshape, sculpture, and appendages, as one seed does from another; and\r\nit is not improbable that, if duly studied, they would furnish as\r\ngood indications of generic distinctions as Gærtner has discovered in\r\nthose of plants. Their most usual form indeed is globular, oval, or\r\noblong, with various intermediate modifications. We meet with them\r\novate, or of the shape of the common hen's egg, flat and orbicular,\r\nelliptical, conical, cylindrical, hemispherical, lenticular,\r\npyramidal, square, turban-shaped, pear-shaped, melon-shaped,\r\nboat-shaped, of the shape of an ale-stand, of a drum, &c.[165], and\r\nsometimes of shapes so strange and peculiar, that we can scarcely\r\ncredit their claim to the name of eggs. Thus the eggs of the gnat\r\nare oblong and narrow, or nearly cylindrical, having at the top a\r\ncylindrical knob[166], so as to give them the precise form of the\r\nround-bottomed phial sometimes used by chemists: those of the common\r\nwater-scorpion (_Nepa cinerea_) are oblong, and at the upper end are\r\nsurrounded by a sort of coronet, consisting of seven slender rays or\r\nbristles of the length of the egg[167], so as to resemble somewhat\r\nthe seeds of _Carduus benedictus_ (_Cnicus acarna_[168]) of the\r\nold botanists. One would think this spinous circlet a very awkward\r\nappendage to bodies which are to be gradually extruded through the\r\nfine membranous ovaries and oviduct which inclose them: but they are\r\nso admirably packed, the unarmed end of each egg fitting closely\r\ninto the space inclosed by the spines of the one next below it,\r\nor, rather, the spines which are moveable, embracing it closely,\r\nthat not only is no room lost, but the ovaries are perfectly secure\r\nfrom injury. The eggs of another species of this tribe (_Ranatra\r\nlinearis_) have only two of these spines or bristles--they are\r\ninserted in the stem of a water-rush (_Scirpus_) or other aquatic\r\nplant, so as to be quite concealed, and are only to be detected\r\nby the two bristles which stand out from it[169]. The eggs of the\r\nbeautiful lace-winged flies (_Hemerobius_), those golden-eyed insects\r\nso serviceable in destroying the plant-lice (_Aphides_[170]), are\r\nstill more singular. Those of _H. Perla_ are oval, and each of them\r\nattached to a filiform pedicle not thicker than a hair, and seven or\r\neight times as long as the egg. By this pedicle (which is supposed\r\nto be formed by a glutinous matter attached to one end, which the\r\nfemale draws out by abstracting her ovipositor with the egg partly\r\nin it from the leaf, to which she has previously applied it, to a\r\nproper length, when the gluten becoming sufficiently solid she wholly\r\nquits the egg,) the eggs are planted in groups of ten or twelve on\r\nthe surface of leaves and twigs, from which they project like so many\r\nsmall fungi, to some of which they have a remarkable resemblance.\r\nWhen the included larva has made its way out of them by forcing open\r\nthe top, they look like little vases, and were actually once figured\r\nby a Naturalist, as we learn from Reaumur, as singular parasitic\r\nflowers growing upon the leaves of the elder, for the origin of which\r\nhe was extremely puzzled to account[171]. Eggs similarly furnished\r\nwith a pedicle are also laid by other insects; but as most of these\r\nhave been before alluded to, it is not necessary to describe them\r\nhere[172]. The cause of these differences of form is for the most\r\npart concealed from us: in many instances it may perhaps be referred\r\nto that will to vary forms, and so to glorify his wisdom[173] and\r\npower, independently of other considerations, which, as Dr. Paley\r\nhas well remarked[174], seems often to have guided the Great Author\r\nof Nature. But in some cases the end to be answered is sufficiently\r\nevident. The long footstalks of the eggs of the _Hemerobius_ just\r\nmentioned, there can be little doubt, are meant to place them out\r\nof the reach of the hosts of predaceous insects which roam around\r\nthem, from whose jaws, thus elevated on their slender shaft, they are\r\nas safe as the eggs of the tailor bird in its twig-suspended nest\r\nfrom the attack of snakes. Reaumur has described the eggs of a kind\r\nof fly, common upon the excrements of the horse and other animals\r\n(_Scatophaga vulgaris_ Latr.), or one related to it, that requires\r\nto be immersed in the dung to which it is committed, on which the\r\nfuture grubs are to feed. He found that if not thus surrounded with\r\nmoisture, they infallibly shrivelled up and came to nothing; but it\r\nis equally necessary that they should not be wholly covered: if they\r\nwere, the young larva would be suffocated at its first exit from the\r\negg. In what way is this nice point secured? In this manner. Each\r\negg is provided at its upper end, at which the animal when hatched\r\ncomes out, with two diverging horns[175]; these prevent it from being\r\nstuck into the excrement, in which the female deposits the eggs one\r\nby one, more than three-fourths of its length: and when examined they\r\nresemble not badly, as Reaumur remarks (except that their colour is\r\nwhite), a parcel of cloves stuck into a pudding, as they are neatly\r\ninserted at due distances in the disgusting mass[176]. The French\r\nNaturalists found these eggs in swine's dung; I have observed them\r\nin cow-dung. Latreille thinks that the bristles above described\r\nattached to the eggs of _Nepa_ and _Ranatra_ have a similar use,\r\nas the female plunges them all but these bristles into the stems\r\nof aquatic plants[177]: but may not this have something to do with\r\ntheir oxygenation? Reaumur has figured another egg of a dipterous\r\ninsect which has a longitudinal wing or lateral margin attached to\r\nit, giving it the form of an oblong square, the object of which,\r\nhe conceives, is to give a greater surface by which it may be more\r\nfirmly fixed to the substance against which the fly attaches it[178].\r\n\r\nBesides these more striking variations in figure, their surface,\r\nthough often smooth, is frequently curiously and most elegantly\r\n_sculptured_, a circumstance that distinguishes the eggs of no other\r\noviparous animals. Some, as the margined egg just mentioned, are only\r\nsculptured on one side, the other being plain; or, as those of the\r\nTusseh silk-worm[179] (_Attacus Paphia_) and other _Bombyces_, which\r\nhave orbicular depressed eggs with a central cavity above and below,\r\nhave their circumference crossed with wrinkles corresponding with\r\nthe rings of the inclosed embryo[180]. Others again are sculptured\r\nall over. Of these, in some, the sculpture of the two sides is not\r\nsymmetrical, as in those of a fly figured by Reaumur[181]: but\r\nin general there is a correspondence in this respect between the\r\ndifferent parts of the egg. In those elegant ones before alluded\r\nto of some bird-louse attached to the golden pheasant, the shell\r\nresembles the purest wax, and is scored with longitudinal striæ,\r\neach distinguished by a series of impressed points, which give it\r\na beautiful appearance of net-work. In the others, as in a common\r\nbutterfly (_Hipparchia Ægeria_) and moth (_Geometra cratægata_),\r\nthe whole surface is covered with hexagonal reticulations[182].\r\nOthers, as those of another butterfly (_Hipparchia Hyperanthus_),\r\nare beset with minute granules or tubercles[183]. Others again, like\r\nthose of the cabbage and hawthorn butterflies (_Pieris Brassicæ_ and\r\n_Cratægi_), are remarkable for beautiful longitudinal ribs, often\r\nconnected by elevated lines crossing them at right angles[184]; and\r\nin some, as in another butterfly (_Hipparchia Jurtina_), crowned by\r\nimbricated scales[185]. Many other minor differences in this respect\r\nmight be noticed, but these will suffice to give some idea of the\r\ninfinite variety exhibited in this respect by these little atoms. If\r\nthe Creator has wrought them with so much art and skill, can it be\r\nbeneath his reasonable creatures to examine and admire them, that\r\nthey may glorify those attributes which they serve to illustrate?\r\n\r\nSome eggs after exclusion occasionally become slightly corrugated:\r\nMalpighi supposed that this occurs only when the eggs are barren,\r\nhaving observed that those of the moth of the silk-worm which preserved\r\ntheir plumpness always produced caterpillars, while those which\r\nlost their original rotundity and became wrinkled were constantly\r\nunprolific. Bonnet, however, found exactly the reverse take place\r\nin another moth[186], so that these appearances are scarcely to be\r\ndepended upon. Kuhn asserts, that a virgin female of the puss-moth\r\n(_Cerura Vinula_) having begun to lay eggs, which were yellow above,\r\ngreen below, and depressed, he introduced to her an hour afterwards a\r\nmale, and some minutes subsequently to the union, she again deposited\r\neggs, which were wholly of a dark brown and convex[187].\r\n\r\n\r\nvii. _Colour_. The colour of the eggs of insects is as various as\r\ntheir shape and sculpture. They are very often white, those of some\r\nspiders like minute pearls[188]; some are yellow, as those of the\r\nsilk-worm; others orange, such are the eggs of the bloody-nosed\r\nbeetle (_Timarcha tenebricosa_); others again of a golden hue;\r\nsometimes they are of a sanguine red. I remember once being much\r\nsurprised at seeing the water at one end of a canal in my garden as\r\nred as blood: upon examining it further I found it discoloured by\r\nan infinite number of minute red eggs, belonging probably to some\r\ndipterous insect of the Tipulidan tribe. There are also eggs of every\r\nintermediate shade between red and black; some again are blue and\r\nothers green. They are not always of whole colours, for some are\r\nspeckled like those of many birds, of which I can show you specimens,\r\nthat are also shaped like birds' eggs; these I think were laid by a\r\ncommon moth (_Odenesis potatoria_); others are banded with different\r\ncolours--thus the blue eggs of the lappet-moth (_Gastropacha\r\nquercifolia_) are encircled by three brown zones[189]; others are\r\nbrown with a white zone[190].\r\n\r\nMany eggs assume a very different colour after being laid a few\r\ndays. In general upon their first exclusion they are white. Those\r\nof the chameleon-fly (_Stratyomis Chamæleon_) which I once found in\r\ngreat numbers, arranged like tiles on a roof one laid partly over\r\nanother, on the under side of the leaves of the water-plantain,\r\nfrom white become green, and then change to olive green. Those of\r\nthe hemipterous enemy of the larch, more than once mentioned in\r\nthis letter, are first mouse-coloured, then they assume a reddish\r\nhue, and lastly a blackish one. Those of the gnat from white in a\r\nshort time assume a shade of green, in a few hours they are entirely\r\ngreen, and at length become gray[191]. Those of the silk-worm,\r\nwhich at first are of a yellow or sulphur colour, acquire a violet\r\nshade. The eggs of that rare moth _Endromis versicolor_, are at\r\nfirst sulphur-coloured, then green, next rose-coloured, and lastly\r\nblackish. The colour of almost all eggs changes when they are near\r\nhatching; but this change depends more frequently upon the colour of\r\nthe included larva, which appears through the transparent shell of\r\nthe egg, than upon any actual alteration in the egg itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nviii. _Period of hatching._ The general rule for the hatching\r\nof the eggs of insects is the absorption by the embryo of all\r\nthe superabundant moisture included in them; but the time varies\r\naccording to the state of the atmosphere, to the action of which they\r\nare subjected. Like those of other animals, they require a certain\r\ndegree of heat for the due evolution of the included larva. This\r\nheat in much the greater number of instances is derived from the\r\ntemperature of the air, but often also from other sources. The eggs\r\nof the gad-fly tribe are hatched principally by the heat of the body\r\nof the animal to which they are committed; and doubtless the vital\r\nheat of various larvæ, small as it may be, must contribute something\r\nto the hatching of the eggs deposited in them by various Ichneumons.\r\nIn the fermenting bark in which the instinct of the rhinoceros\r\nbeetles (_Oryctes nasicornis_ &c.) impels them to place theirs, the\r\ndung which the _Scarabæidæ_ select for that purpose, and the decaying\r\nvegetables chosen by many other insects, a degree of artificial heat\r\nmust exist: and the eggs, or rather egg-like pupæ, of the spider-fly\r\nof the swallow (_Ornithomyia Hirundinis_) are hatched by the heat of\r\nthose birds which sit upon them along with their own eggs.\r\n\r\nFabricius says, \"Insects never sit upon their eggs[192];\" but\r\ncertainly, as I formerly related to you[193], the female earwig does\r\nthis, and one would be induced to suppose, from the circumstance of\r\nthe young ones following their mother, as chickens do the hen, that\r\n_Pentatoma grisea_ (_Cimex_ Linn.), formerly mentioned, may do the\r\nsame[194].\r\n\r\nWith these exceptions, the eggs of all insects are hatched by\r\natmospheric heat alone, the variations in which determine the more\r\nspeedy or more tardy disclosure of the included insect. The eggs\r\nof such species as have several broods in the year, as the nettle\r\nbutterfly (_Vanessa Urticæ_) when laid in summer are hatched in a\r\nfew days; but if not laid till the close of autumn, they remain\r\ndormant through the winter, and are only hatched at the return of\r\nspring. That this difference is to be attributed to the influence\r\nof heat has been often proved by experiment: the autumnal eggs if\r\nbrought into a warm room may be hatched as soon as those laid in\r\nthe height of summer. Silk-worms' eggs naturally are not hatched\r\ntill they have been laid six weeks, but in countries where they are\r\nreared, the women effect their exclusion in a much shorter period\r\nby carrying them in their bosoms: yet to retard their hatching with\r\nparticular views is in many circumstances impossible. When the heat\r\nof the atmosphere has reached a certain point, the hatching cannot\r\nbe retarded by cellars; and M. Faujas has remarked, that in June the\r\nsilk-worm's eggs would hatch in an ice-house[195].\r\n\r\nThe period of exclusion does not, however, depend solely upon\r\ntemperature: the hardness or softness of the shell, and possibly\r\ndifferences in the consistence of the included fluid, intended to\r\nserve this very purpose, cause some eggs to be hatched much sooner\r\nthan others exposed to the same degree of heat. Thus the eggs of many\r\nflesh-flies are hatched in twenty-four hours[196]; those of bees\r\nand some other insects in three days; those of a common lady-bird\r\n(_Coccinella bipunctata_) in five or six days; those of spiders in\r\nabout three weeks; those of the mole-cricket in a month; while those\r\nof many _Lepidoptera_ and _Coleoptera_ require a longer period for\r\nexclusion. The hard eggs of _Lasiocampa Neustria_ and _castrensis_,\r\nnoticed above, remain full nine months before being hatched[197], as\r\ndo those of another moth (_Hypogymna dispar_), which, though laid\r\nin the beginning of the warm month of August, do not send forth the\r\nincluded caterpillar till the April following[198]. We know no more\r\nof the cause of this difference than of that which takes place in\r\nthe period of exclusion of the eggs of the different species of birds.\r\n\r\nSome eggs change considerably both their form and consistence\r\npreviously to being hatched. M. P. Huber found that those of\r\ndifferent species of ants when newly laid are cylindrical, opaque,\r\nand of a milky white; but just before hatching their extremities are\r\narched, and they become transparent with only a single opaque whitish\r\npoint, cloud, or zone, in their interior[199]. An analogous change\r\ntakes place in the eggs of many spiders, which just before hatching\r\nexhibit a change of form corresponding with that which the included\r\nspider receives when its parts begin to be developed, the thin and\r\nflexible skin of the egg moulding itself to the body it incloses[200].\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the germe included in the egg is expanded, it\r\nbecomes visible through the shell when transparent: this is\r\nparticularly the case with spiders, in which, as was before observed,\r\nevery part is very distinctly seen. At length, when all the parts\r\nare consolidated so as to be capable of motion, which in spiders\r\ntakes place in four or five days after they begin to be visible in\r\nthe egg, the animal breaks the pellicle by the swelling of its body\r\nand the movement of its legs, and then quits it, and disengages\r\nall its parts one after the other[201]. In general, at least where\r\nthe shell is harder than that of spiders, insects make their way\r\nout by gnawing an opening with their mandibles in the part nearest\r\ntheir head, which, when the shell is very strong (as in _Lasiocampa\r\nNeustria_, &c.), it is often several hours in accomplishing[202].\r\nIn many instances, however, the larva is spared this trouble, one\r\nend of the egg being furnished with a little lid or trap-door, which\r\nit has but to force up, and it can then emerge at pleasure: such\r\nlids are to be found in the eggs of several butterflies and moths,\r\nas _Satyrus Mæra_, _Saturnia pavonia major_, &c. and the common\r\nlouse[203]. In those exquisitely elegant eggs, before described, of\r\nsome kind of bird-louse (_Nirmus_) found adhering to the base of the\r\nneck feathers of the golden pheasant[204], there is a lid or cap of\r\nthis kind of a hemispherical form terminating in a tortuous style.\r\nThose of a species of bug (_Pentatoma_ Latr.), found by our friend\r\nthe Rev. R. Sheppard, besides a convex lid are furnished with a\r\nvery curious machine, as it should seem, for throwing it off. This\r\nmachine is dark-brown, of a corneous substance, and of the shape of\r\na cross-bow[205], the bow part being attached to the lid or pushing\r\nagainst it, and the handle, by means of a membrane, to the upper end\r\nof the side of the egg.\r\n\r\nWhen the included animal has made its way out of the egg, it enters\r\nupon a new state of existence, that of _Larva_, to which I shall\r\ndirect your attention in the following letter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] The word μεταμορφοω, and its derivative μεταμορφωσις, are not\r\nextant in any Greek writer before the date of the New Testament.\r\nThey are used to express any _external_ change of form or colour,\r\nand metaphorically an _inward_ change and progressive improvement of\r\nthe mind.

In most it continues for a very short time, a few minutes\r\nor perhaps hours, after which they revive and betake themselves to\r\ntheir appropriate food. In others, as in the generality of spiders,\r\nthis debility lasts for seven or eight days, and in some species\r\neven a month, during which the young ones remain inactive in the\r\negg-pouch[206], and it is not till they have cast their first skin\r\nthat their active state of existence commences.\r\n\r\nAll larvæ may be divided into two great divisions:--\r\n\r\n    I. Those which in general form more or less resemble the\r\n         perfect insect.\r\n\r\n    II. Those which are wholly unlike the perfect insect.\r\n\r\nI shall begin by calling your attention to the characters of the\r\n_first_ of these divisions: the second, which is by far the most\r\nnumerous, will be afterwards considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The _first_ division includes the larvæ of _Scorpions_, _Spiders_,\r\n_Cockroaches_, _Grasshoppers_, _Lanthorn-flies_, _Bugs_, &c.; or\r\ngenerally, with the exception of the _Flea_ and _Crustacea_, the\r\nwhole of the _Linnean_ Orders _Aptera_ and _Hemiptera_. All these\r\nlarvæ, however remotely allied in other respects, agree in the general\r\nsimilarity which they bear to the perfect insects which proceed from\r\nthem. The most acute entomologist, untaught by experience, could\r\nnot even guess what would be the form of the perfect insects to be\r\nproduced from larvæ of the _second_ division, while they can recognise\r\nthe form of the spider, the cricket, the cockroach, the bug, and the\r\nfrog-hopper, in that of the larvæ. There are, however, differences in\r\nthe degrees of this resemblance, according to which we may, perhaps,\r\ndivide this tribe in their second state as follows:--\r\n\r\n    i. Those that resemble the perfect insect, except in the\r\n         relative proportions and number of some of their parts.\r\n\r\n    ii. Those which resemble the perfect insect, except that they\r\n         are apterous, or not yet furnished with organs of flight.\r\n\r\ni. Spiders, _Phalangia_, scorpions, lice, _Poduræ_, sugar-lice\r\n(_Lepisma_), mites, centipedes, millepedes, &c. come under the\r\n_first_ subdivision. The larvæ of the first six tribes here mentioned\r\ndiffer at their birth from the perfect insect, only in size and the\r\nproportions of their parts. Thus the larvæ of spiders have their\r\nlegs of a different relative length from that which they subsequently\r\nacquire; and the palpi in the males, which previously to the\r\ndiscoveries of Treviranus were regarded as their sexual organs, are\r\nnot yet fully developed[207]: and a similar difference takes place in\r\nthe legs of _Phalangia_. The general form too of the body undergoes\r\nslight alterations, and the colour very considerable ones, with each\r\nchange of the skin--a change to which all these tribes are subject.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the three last-mentioned tribes (the mites, centipedes,\r\nand millepedes) differ from the perfect insect not only in the\r\nproportion but also in the number of their parts. Leeuwenhoeck states\r\n(and De Geer confirms his assertion, extending it to other species of\r\nmites[208]), that the common cheese-mite, which in its perfect state\r\nhas _eight_ legs, when first excluded from the egg has but _six_, the\r\nthird pair being wanting[209]. Some however are born with _eight_\r\nlegs, for instance _A. eruditus_ of Schrank, which he saw come from\r\nthe egg itself with that number[210]. Others again have never more\r\nthan six legs: this is the case with Latreille's genera--_Caris_,\r\n_Leptus_, _Atoma_, and _Ocypetes_ of Dr. Leach[211]. In the centipedes\r\n(_Scolopendridæ_) and millepedes (_Iulidæ_) differences still more\r\nremarkable, as I have stated in a former letter, have been observed\r\nby De Geer; these animals, in their progress to the perfect state,\r\nnot only gain several additional pairs of _legs_, but also several\r\nadditional _segments_ of the body. This illustrious Entomologist found\r\nthat _Pollyxenus lagurus_ (_Scolopendra_ L.) was born a hexapod,\r\nwith but three segments and as many pairs of feet, but successively\r\nacquired five additional segments with other appendages, and nine\r\nmore pairs of feet[212]. A species of millepede (_Iulus terrestris_\r\nL.), which he also traced from its birth, and which begins the world\r\nat first with only eight segments and six feet, by a successive\r\ndevelopment at length acquires, in its perfect state, 50 segments\r\nand not less than 200 feet[213]. The nature of these very singular\r\naccretions, which Latreille and Mr. Wm. MacLeay have also observed\r\nin the centipedes[214], seems not well understood. If, as is most\r\nprobable, though De Geer could not find any exuviæ[215], the larvæ\r\ncast a skin before each change, they do not essentially differ from\r\nthe metamorphosis of other insects. The legs that these insects thus\r\nacquire are affixed to the abdomen, the six that they set out with\r\nbeing attached to the part representing the trunk, so that the former\r\nmay be regarded as analogous to the prolegs of caterpillars. These\r\nanimals therefore, as I have before intimated, invert the order of\r\nNature, and from _perfect_ degenerate into _imperfect_ insects.\r\n\r\nii. If you examine the _cockroach_, _cricket_, or _grasshopper_, in\r\ndifferent stages of their growth, you will find that the larva does\r\nnot vary essentially from the perfect insect, except in wanting wings\r\nand elytra. The case is the same in almost all the Linnean genera\r\nof the modern order--_Hemiptera_; and with _Raphidia_, _Termes_,\r\nand _Psocus_, in the _Neuroptera_. Some of these, however, exhibit\r\nslighter discrepancies in the proportion of some of their parts,\r\nbut without affecting the general resemblance. Thus the larvæ of\r\nthe common ear-wig have at first only _eight_, and subsequently\r\n_nine_ joints to their antennæ, whereas the perfect insect has\r\n_fourteen_[216]; and the forceps is quite different, resembling\r\nrather two straight styles than what its name implies. In those\r\nalso of many bugs (_Coreus marginatus_ F. &c.), the joints of the\r\nantennæ are of a shape dissimilar to that which obtains in the\r\nperfect insect. In that of the common water-scorpion, the anal\r\nair-tube, which is so long in the imago, is scarcely visible[217]. In\r\nthe _Cicada_ tribe, so celebrated for their song[218], neither the\r\nlarva nor the imago have the enormous thigh armed below with strong\r\nteeth, the tibiæ terminating in a fixed incurved claw, probably for\r\nthe purpose of digging the holes into which they retire till they\r\ndisclose the fly, which distinguish the pupæ of some species, and is\r\nparticularly conspicuous in one commonly brought from China[219].\r\nThese often exhibit also other minor differences.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. In treating of the second great division of larvæ, those that\r\nare wholly unlike the parent insect,--which includes, with few\r\nexceptions[220], the whole of the Linnean orders, _Coleoptera_,\r\n_Lepidoptera_, _Hymenoptera_, _Diptera_, the majority of the\r\n_Neuroptera_, _Coccus_ and _Aleyrodes_ in _Hemiptera_, and the genus\r\n_Pulex_ in _Aptera_,--I shall advert to their characters, under\r\nseveral distinct heads; and to avoid unnecessary circumlocution, I\r\nshall in what follows wholly leave out of consideration the _first_\r\ndivision already explained, and use the term _larvæ_ with reference\r\nonly to those of the _second_. The heads under which I propose to\r\ntreat of them are: The _substance_ of their body, its _parts_,\r\n_shape_, or figure, _clothing_, _colour_. Also the _Economy_ or mode\r\nof life of these creatures: their _food_, _moultings_, _growth_,\r\n_age_, _sex_, and their preparations for assuming the _Pupæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. _Substance_, with the exception of the head and six fore-feet,\r\nwhich are usually corneous, the exterior integument or skin of larvæ\r\nis commonly of a membranous texture, and the body is of a much softer\r\nconsistence than in the perfect insect. In those, however, of some\r\n_Staphylinidæ_ and other _Coleoptera_, the dorsal part of the three\r\nfirst pieces, which represent the trunk of the perfect insect, is\r\nhard and horny. Some also have their whole skin coriaceous, as the\r\ntortoise-shell butterfly (_Vanessa polychloros_); and some few, as\r\nthe wire-worm (_Elater segetum_), and other _Elateres_, very hard.\r\nI possess a very remarkable larva from Brazil, from the extreme\r\nflatness of its body, and from its having cavities to receive its\r\nlegs when unemployed, probably living under bark, the skin of which\r\nis still harder than that of the grub of the Elaters. Perhaps it\r\nhas to resist great pressure; and on that account is gifted with\r\nthis quality, so seldom to be met with in other kinds of larvæ.\r\nThe interior of the body of these animals is generally of a softer\r\nconsistence than in the perfect insect. Their intestines, and other\r\ninternal organs, are usually wrapped in a voluminous substance of\r\na fatty nature, which is regarded as analogous to the _epiploon_,\r\n_omentum_, or _caul_, which envelops the viscera of quadrupeds, &c.,\r\nand is called by Reaumur the _corps graisseux_. The use of this\r\ngeneral flexibility of larvæ is obvious; for, their bodies being\r\nmostly long and narrow, a hard rigid covering would have been very\r\ninconvenient, and a considerable impediment to their motions. When\r\na caterpillar is feeding, it has occasion to apply its body to any\r\npart of the margin of a leaf so as to support itself by its prolegs,\r\nand when moving it wants to give it all the curves that are necessary\r\nto enable it to avoid obstacles, and thread its way through the\r\nsinuous labyrinths which it must often traverse. On the other hand,\r\nthe hardness of the substance of its head affords a strong fulcrum\r\nto the muscles which keep its powerful jaws in constant play. The\r\nlarvæ, indeed, of some _Diptera_ have a membranous head; but their\r\nmandibles, which serve also as legs, are not grinders, but merely\r\nclaws, the muscles of which require less powerful support[221]. Under\r\nthis head it may be proper to observe, that generally larvæ are\r\nopaque; but some, as those of ants, and a few _Lepidoptera_[222],\r\nare diaphanous. That of _Corethra crystallina_ (_Tipula_ De Geer) is\r\nso beautifully transparent as to resemble a piece of crystal, and\r\nscarcely to be distinguished from the water in which it lives[223].\r\n\r\n\r\nii. _Parts._ The body of each larva consists of the _head_, including\r\nits different organs, and of the _succeeding segments_, of which the\r\nthree first may usually be denominated the _trunk_, and have the\r\nsix anterior feet, when present, attached to their under side: the\r\nremainder is the _abdomen_. The latter includes in some species a\r\nvariable number of membranous feet, as well as various appendages\r\naffixed usually to its tail and sides. No larva is ever furnished\r\nwith wings[224]. Each of these greater divisions, and the organs\r\nwhich they include, require separate consideration.\r\n\r\n1. _Head._ This, as was lately observed, is exteriorly of a horny\r\nsubstance, or at least harder than the rest of the body, in most\r\nlarvæ; and on this account, though rarely separated from it by any\r\nvisible distinct neck[225], is, if the larva be of a tolerable\r\nsize, distinguished at the first view. In those of many Dipterous\r\ninsects, however, the head is covered with the same flexible\r\nmembranous skin with the rest of the body, from which it is often\r\nscarcely to be distinguished. In these, except that it contains the\r\norgans of manducation, it wears no more the appearance of a head\r\nthan any other segment of the body, and scarcely so much as the last\r\nor anal one. The head of these larvæ is also remarkable for another\r\npeculiarity,--that it is capable of being extended or contracted,\r\nand assuming different forms at the will of the insect: a property\r\nwhich the head of no superior animal can boast. It is probable that\r\nthere is a considerable variety in the shape and circumstances\r\nof the heads of larvæ; but since, with the exception of those of\r\n_Lepidoptera_, they have had less attention paid to them than they\r\ndeserve (indeed in a vast number of cases, from the difficulty of\r\nmeeting with them, these variations, except in a few instances,\r\nhave not been described), I will here mention a few of the most\r\nremarkable. The head of the young larva at its first exclusion from\r\nthe egg is usually the most dilated part of the body, but it does not\r\noften continue so. In that of _Cicindela campestris_, however,--the\r\nbeautiful green beetle sometimes found in sandy banks,--and also\r\nin several caterpillars of _Lepidoptera_, it is much larger than\r\nany of the following segments[226], which, in conjunction with the\r\nanimal's formidable jaws, gives it a most ferocious appearance. In\r\nsome lepidopterous larvæ the head is of the same diameter with the\r\nrest of the body, but in insects in general it may, I think, be\r\nstated as less; and occasionally it bears no proportion whatever\r\nto it. This is the case with the subcortical one from Brazil lately\r\nmentioned. It is more commonly longer than broad; but in some, as in\r\nthe larvæ of carrion beetles (_Silphæ_), the reverse of this takes\r\nplace. Its shape varies from triangular to orbicular, the mouth of\r\nthe animal forming the vertex of the triangle. In some larvæ of\r\n_Hemerobii_, however, the head is narrowest behind. That of the grub\r\nof a gnat noticed above (_Corethra crystallina_) forms a kind of\r\nsharp horn or claw, terminating the body anteriorly[227]. The contour\r\nof the head of larvæ is usually intire and unbroken; but in the\r\ncaterpillars of some _Lepidoptera_, as the butterfly called the grand\r\nadmiral (_Vanessa Atalanta_), the Glanville fritillary (_Melitæa\r\nCinxia_), &c. it is divided into two lobes[228]. In the Brazil flat\r\nlarvæ it is trilobed, each lateral lobe being divided into three\r\nsmaller ones: in which circumstance it somewhat resembles the head\r\nof some subcortical _Cimicidæ_. Although the part we are treating\r\nof is generally without _horns_, yet in some tropical butterflies\r\nof the tribe of _Nymphales_, it is singularly armed with them. Thus\r\n_Papilio Anchises_ is distinguished, according to Madame Merian[229],\r\nby two in the occiput, which it has the power of retracting. In\r\nthe purple highflier (_Apatura Iris_), a British species, the two\r\nlobes of the head, I am informed, terminate behind in two horns; as\r\nthey do likewise in the brilliant _Morpho Menelaus_[230], the lobes\r\nassuming the form of a pear, and the horn representing the stalk.\r\nIn a caterpillar I found amongst Mr. Francillon's larvæ, the head\r\nis bilobed, with a very long recurving subcapitate subramose spine.\r\nIn _Satyrus Cassiæ_, the head is armed with three occipital stout\r\nspines[231]. The larva of _Nymphalis Amphinome_ Latr. (_Limenitis_\r\nF.) is crowned with a coronet of eight occipital stout acute spines,\r\nthe intermediate ones being the longest[232]; and that of _Morpho\r\nTeucer_ has a similar coronet, consisting of only seven blunt _rays_,\r\nseemingly, rather than spines[233]. With regard to the articulation\r\nof the head with the trunk, it is generally by its _whole_ diameter;\r\nbut in some instances, only by a _part_ of it. This is the case with\r\none of a sphinx figured by Mad. Merian[234]; and I have another,\r\nprobably belonging to the nocturnal _Lepidoptera_ (_Phalæna_\r\nL.)[235]. In both these, the head is vertical and triangular; and in\r\nthe latter (which is a remarkable creature, the tail itself being\r\nmore like a head, and furnished with what resemble two prominent\r\nblack eyes) the vertex of the triangle is considerably higher than\r\nthe back of the animal. Whatever may be the clothing of the body,\r\nthe head is usually _naked_. Sometimes, however, it is itself beset\r\nwith very small simple spines, as in the butterfly of the mallow\r\n(_Hesperia Malvæ_); or with longer compound ones, such as are found\r\non the rest of the body. This is the case with one of a butterfly\r\nnamed by Rösel _Papilio morsa_. The most common _colour_ of the head\r\nof larvæ, where it differs from the rest of the body, is a darker or\r\nlighter reddish brown, or piceous. This is particularly observable\r\nin those of Coleopterous insects, but it is very commonly in other\r\ntribes of the same hue. Sometimes, amongst the _Lepidoptera_, the\r\nhead is of a different colour from the rest of the body; especially\r\nwhere a contrast renders it striking. I can show the caterpillar of\r\nsome insect, probably of the hawk-moth tribe (_Sphingidæ_), from\r\nGeorgia, remarkable for the length of its anal spine, in which the\r\nbody is black, and the head red: another has a white head and a\r\nbrown body. In the larvæ of some _Lepidoptera_, _Coleoptera_, and\r\n_Diptera_, the head can be wholly or nearly withdrawn within the\r\nfirst segment of the body. This may be readily seen in that of the\r\ncommon glow-worm; and that of a small gnat (_Tipula replicata_\r\nDe Geer) withdraws it so completely that the anterior margin of\r\nthat segment closes the orifice, so that the animal appears to\r\nhave no head[236].--The parts of the head which require distinct\r\nconsideration are, the _eyes_, _antennæ_, and the _mouth_: consisting\r\nof various organs, which will be specified. Some of these parts\r\nand organs are peculiar to larvæ of one order, others to those of\r\nanother, and some are furnished with them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eyes._ The larvæ of many insects have no eyes. Those with antennæ\r\nwhich terminate in a lamellated clava (_Scarabæus_ L.), and\r\ncapricorn beetles also (_Cerambyx_ L.), amongst the _Coleoptera_,\r\nare without them, and probably several others; and amongst the\r\n_Diptera_, all those with a membranous or variable head. Those of the\r\nremaining orders, with the exception, perhaps, of some _Hymenoptera_\r\nand _Lepidoptera_, are furnished with these organs; and in the\r\n_Coleoptera_ all the predaceous tribes, as well as most of those that\r\nare herbivorous or granivorous, and the Gnats and other Tipulidans\r\n(_Tipulariæ_ Latr.) in the _Diptera_, are also distinguished by\r\nthem. In the larvæ of the dragon-flies (_Libellula_ L.), and other\r\n_Neuroptera_, they are composed of many facets as in those of the\r\nperfect insect, from which they differ chiefly in being smaller.\r\nBut in the other insects of this description they are simple, and\r\nresemble those of the _Arachnida_, and many aptera. These simple\r\neyes vary in their number, in different genera and tribes, from one\r\nto six on each side of the head. Thus the larva of _Telephorus_,\r\nand the saw-flies, has only _one_[237]; that of _Cicindela three_,\r\nthe two posterior ones being large with a red pupil surrounded by\r\na paler iris, which adds to the fierce aspect of this animal; and\r\nthe anterior one very minute. Those of the tortoise-beetles also\r\n(_Cassida_) have _three_[238]; of _Staphylinus, four_; of _Timarcha_\r\n(the bloody-nosed beetle) _five_; of _Carabus_, and the _Lepidoptera_\r\nin general, _six_. In the last they are of different sizes, and\r\ngenerally arranged in a circle: in that of _Hemerobius_ there are\r\nfive in a circle, with one central one[239]. The appearance of\r\nthese globules, which are often not visible but under a powerful\r\nlens, is so different from that of the eyes of a butterfly or moth,\r\nor other perfect insect, that it has been doubted whether they\r\nactually perform the office of _eyes_, but without reason. They\r\noccupy the usual station of those organs, being situated in many\r\ninstances upon a protuberance which appears to incase them; and seem\r\nof a construction closely analogous to that of the eyes of spiders,\r\nand the _stemmata_ or _ocelli_ of _Hymenoptera_, which have been\r\nsatisfactorily proved to be organs of vision. In the larva of a moth\r\nnot yet ascertained to exist in this country, _Attacus Tau_, and\r\nprobably other species, the eyes, after the skin has been changed a\r\nfew times, are no longer to be seen[240].\r\n\r\n_Antennæ._ Most larvæ are provided with organs near the base of the\r\nmandibles, which from their situation and figure may be regarded\r\nas antennæ. Fabricius has asserted that the larvæ of the saw-flies\r\n(_Tenthredo_ L.) have no antennæ; but in this he was mistaken, for\r\nthough very short, they are discoverable in them, as he might have\r\nlearned by consulting De Geer[241]. In the majority of _Neuropterous_\r\nlarvæ, they almost precisely resemble those of the perfect insect.\r\nIn all the rest they are very different. The antennæ of Coleopterous\r\nlarvæ are usually either filiform or setaceous, consisting of four\r\nor five joints, nearly equal in length. Those of Lepidopterous\r\nlarvæ are commonly conical, as are those likewise of _Chrysomela_\r\nand _Coccinella_ &c. amongst the _Coleoptera_, and very short,\r\ncomposed of two or three joints, of which the last is much thinner\r\nthan the first, and ends in one or two hairs or bristles. These\r\nantennæ the larva has the power of protruding or retracting at\r\npleasure. Lyonnet informs us, that the caterpillar of the great\r\ngoat-moth (_Cossus ligniperda_) can draw the joints of its antennæ\r\none within the other, so as nearly to conceal the whole[242]. The\r\nlarva of the common gnat has two long incurved setaceous antennæ,\r\nfringed with hairs at some distance from their apex, which consist\r\nonly of a single joint[243]. The greater number of Dipterous larvæ,\r\nhowever, all indeed except the Tipulidans (_Tipulariæ_ Latr.), and\r\nmany belonging to the _Coleoptera_ and _Hymenoptera_ orders (as\r\nthose of _Curculio_, _Apion_, _Apis_, &c.), are wholly deprived of\r\nantennæ. It is a general rule, that the antennæ of larvæ are shorter\r\nthan the same organs in the perfect insect, the tribe _Ephemerina_\r\nperhaps affording the only example in which the reverse of this takes\r\nplace[244].\r\n\r\n_Mouth._ All larvæ have a mouth situated in the head, by which they\r\nreceive their food, and furnished with one or more instruments for\r\nthe purpose of mastication and deglutition. These instruments, in all\r\nthe orders except _Lepidoptera_, some _Neuroptera_ and _Diptera_,\r\nbear a general resemblance to the same parts in the perfect insect.\r\nIn larvæ of the Coleopterous, Lepidopterous, and Hymenopterous\r\norders, we can distinguish for the most part an upper and under lip;\r\ntwo pairs of jaws answering to the mandibulæ and maxillæ; and two,\r\nfour, or six palpi[245]: and some of these instruments may be found\r\nin most _Diptera_. Each of these parts require separate notice.\r\n\r\n_Upper-lip_ (LABRUM). The mouth of almost all larvæ, except some of\r\nthe order _Diptera_, are provided with a distinct _upper-lip_, for\r\nretaining their food during mastication. As the construction of this\r\npart does not widely differ from that of the perfect insect, which will\r\nhereafter be more fully described, it is only necessary to observe,\r\nthat it is usually a transverse moveable plate, attached posteriorly to\r\nthe nasus (_clypeus_ F.), and situated just above the mandibles[246].\r\n\r\n_Upper-jaws_ (MANDIBULÆ). The most usual figure of these, which are of\r\na hard horny consistence[247], is that of two slightly concave, oblong,\r\nor triangular plates, often at their lower extremity of considerable\r\nthickness, and of very irregular form, the base of which is filled\r\nwith powerful muscles, and planted in the side of the mouth so as to\r\nmove transversely. The other extremity can be made to meet or diverge\r\nlike the claws of pincers, and are divided into one or more tooth-like\r\nindentations, by means of which the food of the larva is cut[248].\r\nThis is their construction in the larvæ of all _Lepidoptera_, and in\r\nmany of those of the other orders. They frequently, however, assume\r\na different form, though their situation is always the same. Thus\r\nin the larvæ of the capricorn beetles (_Cerambyx_ L.) and of other\r\nwood-boring species, they are shaped like the half of a cone, the inner\r\nsides of which, applying close to each other, form a pair of powerful\r\ngrindstones, capable of comminuting the hardest timber[249]. M. Cuvier\r\nhas observed, with regard to the mandibulæ of those of stag-beetles\r\n(_Lucanus_), that besides their teeth at the extremity, they have\r\ntowards their base a flat striated molary surface; so that they both\r\ncut and grind their ligneous food[250]. It seems to have escaped\r\nhim, that a similar structure takes place in many perfect insects of\r\nthe lamellicorn tribe, as I shall hereafter show you. In the larvæ\r\nof the water-beetles (_Dytiscus_ L.), ant-lions (_Myrmeleon_ L.),\r\nand lace-winged flies (_Hemerobius_ L.), they resemble somewhat the\r\nforceps at the tail of an ear-wig, being long and incurved; and, what\r\nis more remarkable, hollow and perforated at the end, so as to serve\r\nas a channel for conveying into the larva's mouth the juices of the\r\nprey which by their aid it has seized. Reaumur even asserts, that the\r\nlarva of _Myrmeleon_ has no other entrance into its throat than through\r\nthese tubular mandibles[251]. That of the rove-beetles (_Staphylinus_\r\nL.), and of many other Coleopterous genera, have these organs of this\r\nforcipate construction, without being perforated[252]. In the larva of\r\nthe carnivorous flies, and many other _Diptera_, are two black incurved\r\nsubulate parts, connected at the base, and capable of being protruded\r\nout of, and retracted into, the head, through the skin of which they\r\nare usually visible. As I informed you in a former letter[253],\r\nthese mandibles are used for _walking_ as well as _feeding_: they\r\nare parallel to each other, and are neither formed for cutting nor\r\ngrinding like the mandibles of other insects, but merely detach\r\nparticles of food by digging into it and tearing the fibres asunder.\r\nIn this operation they are probably assisted by an acutely triangular\r\ndart-like instrument of a horny substance, which in some species\r\n(_Musca vomitoria_) is placed between the two. In others this part is\r\nwanting. Some Dipterous larvæ have two similar mandibles, but instead\r\nof being parallel, they are placed one above the other; others (_Musca\r\ndomestica_ and _meridiana_) have but one such mandible, and some have\r\nno perceptible mandible of any kind. The mandibles of the larva of the\r\ncrane-flies (_Tipula_), which are transverse and unguiform, do not act\r\nagainst each other, but against two other fixed, internally concave and\r\nexternally convex, and dentated pieces[254].\r\n\r\n_Under-jaws_ (MAXILLÆ). These are a pair of organs, usually of a\r\nsofter consistence, placed immediately under the upper-jaws; but as\r\nthey are usually so formed and situated as not to have any action\r\nupon each other, it is probable that in general they rather assist\r\nin submitting the food to the action of the mandibulæ, than in the\r\ncomminution of it. In Lepidopterous larvæ they appear to be conical\r\nor cylindrical (at least in that of the cossus so admirably figured\r\nby Lyonnet[255]), and to consist of two joints; which may, I imagine,\r\nbe analogous to the upper and lower portions of which the maxillæ of\r\nperfect insects usually consist. The last of these joints is surmounted\r\nby two smaller jointed palpiform organs. If any part of the maxillæ can\r\nact upon each other, it is these organs or palpi; but it is evident\r\nthey are not calculated for mastication, although they may assist in\r\nthe retention of the substance to be masticated. In a figure given\r\nby Reaumur of the under side of the head of another lepidopterous\r\nlarva (_Erminea Pomonella_), the maxillæ consist of a single joint,\r\nand appear to be crowned by chelate palpi[256]: a circumstance\r\nwhich is also observable in that of a common species of stag-beetle\r\n(_Lucanus parallelipipedus_), the weevil of the water-hemlock (_Lixus\r\nparaplecticus_[257]), and other insects. In general the maxillæ of\r\nlarvæ are without the lobe or lobes discoverable in those of most\r\nperfect insects, this part being usually represented by a kind of\r\nnipple, or palpiform jointed process, strictly analogous to the\r\ninterior maxillary palpi of the predaceous coleoptera; but in most\r\nof the lamellicorn beetles the lobe exists in its proper form[258],\r\nas it does likewise in that of the capricorn-beetle before noticed\r\n(_Callidium violaceum_[259]). In the former instance, it is armed with\r\nspines or claws; but in the latter it is unarmed, and rounded at the\r\nend. In the larva of _Cicindela campestris_, the base of the maxilla\r\nruns in a transverse direction from the mentum, to which, as is usually\r\nthe case, it is attached. From this at right angles proceeds the lobe,\r\nfrom the outer side of which the feeler emerges; and the inner part\r\nterminates in an unguiform joint, ending in two or three bristles. The\r\nstructure in the larvæ of water-beetles (_Dytiscus_ L.) is different,\r\nfor they appear to be without maxillæ[260]; but the case really seems\r\nto be, that these organs are represented by the first joint of what M.\r\nCuvier calls their _palpi_[261]; from which proceed the real palpi, the\r\ninterior one being very short, and consisting only of a single joint.\r\nThese maxillæ of larvæ were regarded by Reaumur and other writers as\r\nparts of the under-lip, on each side of which they are situated; and\r\nindeed, as well as those in the perfect insect, they form a part of\r\nthe same machine, being connected by their base with the mentum, which\r\nis part of the labium, but they are clearly analogous to the maxillæ\r\nof the imago. They are not to be found in the larvæ of many Dipterous\r\ninsects, and perhaps in some species belonging to other orders. In some\r\nNeuropterous larvæ, as those of the _Libellulina_ MacLeay, the maxillæ\r\nare of a substance quite as solid and horny as the mandibles, which in\r\nevery respect they resemble[262].\r\n\r\n_Under-lip_ (LABIUM). Between the two maxillæ in the larvæ of most\r\nof the insects under consideration is a part termed by Reaumur the\r\nmiddle division of the under-lip, but which is in fact analogous to\r\nthe whole of that organ in the _imago_. This organ varies in shape,\r\nbeing sometimes quadrangular, often conical, &c. Interiorly it is\r\nfrequently connected with a more fleshy protuberance, called the\r\ntongue by Reaumur[263], and supplying the place of the _ligula_ in\r\nthe perfect insect. On each side of the apex of the under-lip is a\r\nminute feeler, and in the middle between these in the _Lepidoptera_\r\nand many others, is a filiform organ, which I shall call the\r\n_spinneret_ (_Fusulus_), through which the larva draws the silken\r\nthread employed in fabricating its cocoon, preparatory to assuming\r\nthe pupa state, and for other purposes[264]. This organ is found\r\nonly in those larvæ which have the power of spinning silk; that\r\nis, in all _Lepidoptera_, most _Hymenoptera_, _Trichoptera_, some\r\n_Neuroptera_, and even a _Dipterous_ insect[265]. This tube, Lyonnet\r\nhad reason to believe, is composed of longitudinal slips, alternately\r\ncorneous and membranous, so as to give the insect the power of\r\ncontracting its diameter, and thus making the thread thicker or\r\nsmaller. There is only a single orifice at the end, which is cut\r\nobliquely, somewhat like a pen, only with less obliquity, and without\r\na point, the opening being below, so as to be conveniently applicable\r\nto the bodies on which the larva is placed. Reaumur conceived that\r\nthis spinneret had two orifices; but Lyonnet ascertained this to be\r\na mistake, the two silk tubes uniting into one before they reach the\r\norifice. From the contractile nature of the sides and the form of the\r\norifice, combined with the power the insect has of moving it in every\r\ndirection, results the great difference which we see in the breadth\r\nand form of the threads, some being seven or eight times as thick as\r\nothers, some cylindrical, others flat, others channelled, and others\r\nof different thickness in different parts[266]. In the larvæ of many\r\n_Diptera_ the under-lip is merely a small tubercle, which can be\r\nprotruded from the insect's mouth by pressure[267].\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable prepensile instruments, in which the art and\r\nskill of a DIVINE MECHANICIAN are singularly conspicuous, and which\r\nappears to be without a parallel in the insect world, may be seen in\r\nthe under-lip of the various species of dragon-fly (_Libellula_ L.).\r\nIn other larvæ this part is usually small and inconspicuous, and\r\nserves merely for retaining the food and assisting in its deglutition;\r\nbut in these it is by far the largest organ of the mouth, which when\r\nclosed it entirely conceals; and it not only retains but actually\r\nseizes the animal's prey, by means of a very singular pair of jaws\r\nwith which it is furnished. Conceive your under-lip (to have recourse,\r\nas Reaumur on another occasion[268], to such comparison,) to be horny\r\ninstead of fleshy, and to be elongated perpendicularly downwards[269],\r\nso as to wrap over your chin and extend to its bottom,--that this\r\nelongation is there expanded into a triangular convex plate[270],\r\nattached to it by a joint[271], so as to bend upwards again and fold\r\nover the face as high as the nose, concealing not only the chin and the\r\nfirst-mentioned elongation, but the mouth and part of the cheeks[272]:\r\nconceive, moreover, that to the end of this last-mentioned plate are\r\nfixed two other convex ones, so broad as to cover the whole nose and\r\ntemples[273],--that these can open at pleasure, transversely like a\r\npair of jaws, so as to expose the nose and mouth, and that their inner\r\nedges where they meet are cut into numerous sharp teeth or spines,\r\nor armed with one or more long and sharp claws[274]:--you will then\r\nhave as accurate an idea as my powers of description can give, of the\r\nstrange conformation of the under-lip in the larvæ of the tribes of\r\n_Libellulina_; which conceals the mouth and face precisely as I have\r\nsupposed a similar construction of your lip would do yours. You will\r\nprobably admit that your own visage would present an appearance not\r\nvery engaging while concealed by such a mask; but it would strike\r\nstill more awe into the spectators, were they to see you first open\r\nthe two upper jaw-like plates, which would project from each temple\r\nlike the blinders of a horse; and next, having by means of the joint\r\nat your chin let down the whole apparatus and uncovered your face,\r\nemploy them in seizing any food that presented itself, and conveying\r\nit to your mouth. Yet this procedure is that adopted by the larvæ\r\nprovided with this strange organ. While it is at rest, it applies\r\nclose to and covers the face. When the insects would make use of it,\r\nthey unfold it like an arm, catch the prey at which they aim by means\r\nof the mandibuliform plates, and then partly refold it so as to hold\r\nthe prey to the mouth in a convenient position for the operation of\r\nthe two pairs of jaws with which they are provided. Reaumur once found\r\none of them thus holding and devouring a large tadpole;--a sufficient\r\nproof that Swammerdam was greatly deceived in imagining earth to be\r\nthe food of animals so tremendously armed and fitted for carnivorous\r\npurposes. Such an under-lip as I have described is found in the tribe\r\nof dragon-flies (_Libellulina_); varied, however, considerably in its\r\nfigure in the different genera. In the larva of _Libellula_ Fab.,\r\nsuch as _Libellula depressa_, &c. it is of the shape above described;\r\nso exactly resembling a mask, that if Entomologists ever went to\r\nmasquerades, they could not more effectually relieve the insipidity of\r\nsuch amusements and attract the attention of the _demoiselles_, than\r\nby appearing at the supper table with a _mask_ of this construction,\r\nand serving themselves by its assistance. It would be difficult, to\r\nbe sure, by mechanism to supply the place of the muscles with which\r\nin the insect it is amply provided: but Merlin, or his successor, has\r\nsurmounted greater obstacles. In the larva of the Fabrician _Æshnæ_\r\n(_Libellula grandis_, &c. L.), this apparatus is not convex but flat:\r\nso that, though it equally conceals the face, it does not so accurately\r\nresemble a mask; and the jaws at its apex are not convex plates, but\r\nrather two single conical teeth[275]. It is, as to its general shape,\r\nsimilarly constructed in _Agrion_ Fab. (_L. Virgo_, &c. L.); but the\r\nfirst joint is more remarkably elongated, the jaws more precisely\r\nresemble jaws than in any of the rest, and are armed with three long,\r\nvery sharp teeth: between them also there is a lozenge-shaped opening,\r\nthrough which, when the apparatus is closed, is protruded a circular\r\nsort of nipple, apparently analogous to the ligula[276]. _Libellula\r\nænea_, L., which is the type of another tribe (_Cordulia_ Leach), has a\r\nmask somewhat different from all the above, the jaws being armed with\r\na moveable claw and an internal tooth[277]. You will admire the wisdom\r\nof this admirable contrivance, when you reflect that these larvæ are\r\nnot fitted to pursue their prey with rapidity, like most predaceous\r\nanimals; but that they steal upon them, as De Geer observes[278], as\r\na cat does upon a bird, very slowly, and as if they counted their\r\nsteps; and then, by a sudden evolution of this machine, take them as\r\nit were by surprise, when they think themselves safe. De Geer says, it\r\nis very difficult for other insects to elude their attacks, and that\r\nhe has even seen them devour very small fishes[279]. As these animals\r\nare found in almost every ditch, you will doubtless lose no time in\r\nexamining for yourself an instance of so singular a construction.\r\n\r\n_Feelers_ (PALPI). In the orders _Diptera_ and _Hymenoptera_ are\r\nmany larvæ in which these organs have not been certainly discovered;\r\nyet Reaumur in that of a common fly (_M. meridiana_ L.) found four\r\nretractile nipples[280] which seem analogous to them; and Latreille\r\nhas observed, that below the mandibles of those of ants are four\r\nminute points, two on each side[281]: but in all other larvæ their\r\nexistence is more clearly ascertained. The _maxillary_ palpi vary\r\nin _number_, many having _two_ on each maxilla and others only\r\n_one_. In the perfect insect the former is one of the distinguishing\r\ncharacters of the predaceous beetles (_Entomophagi_ Latr.), but in\r\nthe larvæ it is more widely extended; since even in the caterpillars\r\nof _Lepidoptera_ the inner lobe of the maxilla which represents this\r\nfeeler is jointed, which is precisely the case with the beetles\r\njust named. Cuvier has observed this circumstance in the larva of\r\nthe stag-beetle[282]; and it belongs to many other _Coleoptera_\r\nthat have only a pair of maxillary palpi in the perfect state. The\r\n_labial_ palpi are always two, emerging usually one on each side from\r\nthe apex of the under-lip. With regard to the _form_ of the palpi,\r\nthose of the _Lepidoptera_ are mostly conical; in other orders they\r\nare sometimes setaceous and sometimes filiform. Their termination\r\nis generally simple, but sometimes the last joint is divided. They\r\nare for the most part very short, and the labial shorter than the\r\nmaxillary. The latter never exceed _four_ joints[283], which seems\r\nthe most natural number; and the former are limited to _three_. Both\r\nvary between these numbers, and _one_ joint. The joints, though\r\ncommonly simple, are sometimes branched. This is the case with one I\r\nmet with in considerable numbers upon the Turnip, in October 1808,\r\nthe second joint of the palpi of which sends forth near the apex an\r\ninternal branch. In the larva of the _Cossus_, as Lyonnet informs\r\nus[284], the joints of the palpi are retractile, so that the whole of\r\nthe organ may be nearly withdrawn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter thus describing the _head_ of larvæ, and its principal organs,\r\nwe must next say something upon the remainder of the body, or what\r\nconstitutes the\r\n\r\n2. _Trunk and Abdomen_: which I shall consider under one article.\r\nThese are composed of several _segments_ or rings, to which the\r\nfeet and other appendages of the body are fixed. The form of these\r\nsegments, or that of their vertical section, varies considerably: in\r\nmany _Lepidoptera_, the wire-worm, &c., it would be nearly circular;\r\nin others a greater or less segment of a circle would represent it;\r\nand in some, perhaps, it would consist of two such segments applied\r\ntogether. Their lower surface is generally nearly plane. Their most\r\nnatural _number_, without the head and including the anal segment, is\r\ntwelve: this they seldom exceed, and perhaps never fourteen. The three\r\nfirst segments are those which represent the _trunk_ of the perfect\r\ninsect, and to which the six anterior legs when present are affixed. In\r\ngeneral, they differ from the remaining segments only in being shorter,\r\nand in many cases less distinctly characterized; but in Neuropterous\r\nlarvæ, those of _Dytisci_, and some other _Coleoptera_, they are longer\r\nthan the succeeding ones, and pretty nearly resemble the trunk of the\r\nanimal in its last state. The surface of the trunk and abdomen will be\r\nconsidered under a subsequent head; I shall not, therefore, describe it\r\nhere. The _conformation_ of the different segments varies but little,\r\nexcept of the terminal one, or tail, which in different larvæ takes\r\nvarious figures. In most, this part is obtuse and rounded; in others\r\nacute or acuminate; in others truncate; and in others emarginate, or\r\nwith a wider sinus, and with intermediate modifications of shape which\r\nit would be endless to particularize. In some, also, it is simple and\r\nunarmed; in others beset with horns, spines, radii, and tubercles of\r\ndifferent forms, some of which will come under future consideration.\r\nThe parts connected with the trunk and abdomen which will require\r\nseparate consideration, are the _legs_, the _spiracles_, and various\r\n_appendages_.\r\n\r\n_Legs._ It may be stated generally that the larvæ of the orders\r\n_Coleoptera_, _Lepidoptera_, and _Neuroptera_, have legs; and that\r\nthose of the orders _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_ have none. This must\r\nbe understood, however, with some exceptions. Thus the larvæ of some\r\n_Coleoptera_, as the weevil tribes (_Curculio_ L.) have no legs,\r\nunless we may call by that name certain fleshy tubercles besmeared\r\nwith gluten, which assist them in their motions[285]; while those\r\nof _Tenthredo_ and _Sirex_ in the order _Hymenoptera_ are furnished\r\nwith these organs. At present I know no Dipterous larva that may be\r\nsaid to have _real_ legs, unless we are to regard as such certain\r\ntentacula formed upon a different model from the legs of other\r\nlarvæ[286]. Rösel has, I think, figured a Lepidopterous apode. No\r\nNeuropterous one has yet been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe legs of larvæ are of two kinds; either horny and composed of\r\njoints, or fleshy and without joints[287]. The first of these, as\r\nI observed in a former letter[288], are the principal instruments\r\nof locomotion, and the last are to be regarded chiefly as props and\r\nstays by which the animal keeps its long body from trailing, or by\r\nwhich it takes hold of surfaces; while the other legs, or where there\r\nare none, the annuli of its body, regulate its motions. The former\r\nhave been commonly called _true legs_ (_pedes veri_), because they\r\nare persistent, being found in the perfect insect as well as in the\r\nlarva; and the latter _spurious legs_ (_pedes spurii_), because they\r\nare caducous, being found in the larva only. Instead of these not\r\nvery appropriate names, I shall employ for the former the simple term\r\n_legs_, and for the latter _prolegs_ (_propedes_)[289].\r\n\r\nThe legs, when present, are always in number _six_, and attached by\r\npairs to the underside of the three first segments of the trunk. They\r\nare of a horny substance, and consist usually of the same parts as\r\nthose of the perfect insect; namely, _coxa_, _trochanter_, _femur_,\r\n_tibia_, and _tarsus_, suspended to each other by membranous ligaments:\r\nthese parts are less distinctly marked in some than in others. Thus in\r\nthe legs of a caterpillar, or the grub of a capricorn-beetle, at first\r\nyou would think there were only three or four joints besides the claw;\r\nbut upon a nearer inspection, you would discover at the base of the\r\nleg the rudiments of two others[290], in the latter represented indeed\r\nby the fleshy protuberance from which the legs emerge. In the larvæ of\r\nthe predaceous _Coleoptera_, the hip and trochanter are as conspicuous\r\nnearly as in the perfect insect; and the tarsus, which still consists\r\nof only a single joint, is armed with two claws[291]. In those of the\r\n_Neuroptera_ order, in which all the joints are very conspicuous, the\r\ntarsi are jointed, as well as two-clawed[292]. The legs of larvæ are\r\nusually shorter than those of the perfect insect, and scarcely differ\r\nfrom each other in shape, for they all gradually decrease in diameter\r\nfrom the base to the apex. This is the most usual conformation of\r\nthem in Lepidopterous, Hymenopterous, and some Coleopterous larvæ,\r\n(those of the capricorn-beetles are very short and minute, so as to be\r\nscarcely visible,) in which they are so small as to be concealed by the\r\nbody of the insect[293]. In Neuropterous larvæ, however, and several\r\n_Coleoptera_, as those of _Dytiscus_, _Staphylinus_, _Coccinella_, &c.,\r\nthey more resemble the legs of the perfect insect, the joints being\r\nmore elongated, and the femoral one projecting beyond the body[294].\r\n\r\nYou will find no other than true legs in most Coleopterous,\r\nNeuropterous, and Hymenopterous larvæ. But those of the saw-flies\r\n(_Tenthredo_ L.), and all caterpillars, have besides a number of\r\n_prolegs_: a few Dipterous larvæ also, are provided with some organs\r\nnearly analogous to them. These _prolegs_ are fleshy, commonly\r\nconical or cylindrical, and sometimes retractile protuberances,\r\nusually attached by pairs to the underside of that part of the body\r\nthat represents the abdomen of the future fly[295]. They vary in\r\nconformation and in number; some having but one, others as many as\r\neighteen.\r\n\r\nWith regard to their _conformation_, they may be divided into two\r\nprincipal sections: first, those furnished with terminal claws; and\r\nsecondly, those deprived of them. Each of which may be divided into\r\nsmaller sections, founded on the general figure of the prolegs, and\r\narrangement of the claws or hooks.\r\n\r\ni. The prolegs of almost all Lepidopterous larvæ are furnished\r\nwith a set of minute slender horny hooks, crotchets, or _claws_,\r\nof different lengths, somewhat resembling fish-hooks; which either\r\npartially or wholly surround the apex like a pallisade. By means\r\nof these claws, of which there are from forty to sixty in each\r\nproleg, a short and a long one arranged alternately, the insect is\r\nenabled to cling to smooth surfaces, to grasp the smallest twigs to\r\nwhich the legs could not possibly adhere: a circumstance which the\r\nflexible nature of the prolegs greatly facilitates[296]. Claws nearly\r\nsimilar are found on the prolegs of some _Dipterous_ larvæ[297],\r\nbut not in any of those of the other orders. These last, however,\r\nare seldom either so numerous, or arranged in the same manner, as\r\nin caterpillars. When the sole of the foot is open, the claws with\r\nwhich it is more or less surrounded are turned outwards, and are in a\r\nsituation to lay hold of any surface; but when the animal wishes to\r\nlet go its hold, it begins to draw in the skin of the sole, and in\r\nproportion as this is retracted, the claws turn their points inwards,\r\nso as not to impede its motion[298].\r\n\r\nThe prolegs with claws may be further divided into four different kinds.\r\n\r\n1. In the larvæ of the great majority of butterflies and moths they\r\nassume the form of a truncated cone, the lower and smaller end of which\r\nis expanded into a semicircular or subtriangular plate, having the\r\ninner half of its circumference beset with the claws above mentioned;\r\nand, from its great power of dilating and contracting, admirably\r\nadapted for performing the offices of a foot. Jungius calls these legs\r\n_pedes elephantini_[299]; and the term is not altogether inapplicable,\r\nsince they exhibit considerable resemblance to the clumsy but\r\naccommodating leg and foot of the gigantic animal he alludes to.\r\n\r\n2. The larvæ of many minute moths, particularly of the Fabrician\r\ngenera _Tortrix_ and _Tinea_--those which live in convoluted leaves,\r\nthe interior of fruits, &c., as well as the _Cossus_, and some\r\nother large moths,--have their prolegs of a form not very unlike\r\nthose of the preceding class, but shorter, and without any terminal\r\nexpansion; the apex, moreover, is wholly, instead of half, surrounded\r\nwith claws[300]; the additional provision of which, together with a\r\ncentrical kind of nipple capable of being protruded or retracted,\r\nin some measure, though imperfectly, supplies the place of the more\r\nflexible plate-like expansion present in the first class.\r\n\r\n3. The third class is composed of a very few _Lepidopterous_ larvæ\r\nwhich have their prolegs very thick and conical at the base, but\r\nafterwards remarkably slender, long, and cylindrical, so as exactly to\r\nassume the shape of a wooden leg[301]. These, as in the first class,\r\nare expanded at the end into a flat plate: but this is wholly circular,\r\nis surrounded with claws, and has also in the middle a retractile\r\nnipple, as in the preceding class. In _Cossus_, at least in an American\r\nspecies (_Cossus Robiniæ_), described by Professor Peck[302], the anal\r\nprolegs have the claws only on their _exterior_ half.\r\n\r\n4. The remaining description of unguiferous prolegs, if they may\r\nnot rather be deemed a kind of tentacula, are those of certain\r\n_Diptera_, provided with no true legs; which differ from the three\r\npreceding classes, either in their shape, or the arrangement of their\r\nclaws. In one kind of those remarkable larvæ, which from their long\r\nrespiratory anal tubes Reaumur denominates \"_rat-tailed_,\" that of\r\n_Elophilus pendulus_, there are fourteen of these prolegs, affixed\r\nby pairs to the ventral segments, the twelve posterior ones of which\r\nare subconical, and truncate at the apex, which is surrounded with\r\ntwo circles of very minute claws, those of the inner being much more\r\nnumerous and shorter than those of the exterior circle; while the\r\nanterior pair terminate in a flat expansion, and in shape almost\r\nexactly resemble those of a mole[303]. The prolegs of the larvæ of\r\na kind of gnat called by De Geer _Tipula amphibia_, and of _Syrphus\r\nmystaceus_ F., (_Musca plumata_ De Geer,) are nearly of a similar\r\nconstruction, but in the last are armed with three claws only[304].\r\nLong moveable claws also distinguish the singular prolegs before\r\ndescribed[305] of another gnat (_Tanypus maculatus_ Meig., _Tipula_\r\nDe Geer). The case-worms (_Trichoptera_ K.) and some others, have two\r\nprolegs at the anus, each furnished with a single claw[306].\r\n\r\nii. The prolegs _deprived_ of _claws_ are found in the larva of the\r\nHymenopterous tribe of saw-flies (_Tenthredo_ L.), in those of some\r\n_Lepidoptera_ (_Hepialus_ F. &c.), and in some few Coleopterous and\r\nDipterous genera. Those of the former are of the shape of a truncated\r\ncone, and resemble the second class of unguiculate prolegs, except\r\nin the defect of claws. In the latter they are a mere retractile\r\nnipple-like protuberance, in some species so small as scarcely to be\r\nperceptible. In all they aid in progressive motion; but it is by laying\r\nhold of surfaces, and so enabling the body more readily to push itself\r\nforward by annular contraction and dilatation, and not by taking steps,\r\nof which all prolegs are incapable: to assist in this purpose the\r\nprotuberance sometimes secretes a gluten[307], which supplies the place\r\nof claws. Some larvæ have the power of voluntarily dilating certain\r\nportions of the underside of their body, so as to assume nearly the\r\nshape and to perform the functions of prolegs. In a Coleopterous (?)\r\nsubcortical one from Brazil, before alluded to, there are four round\r\nand nearly flat areas in each ventral segment of the abdomen, but the\r\nlast very little raised above the surface, and rough, somewhat like a\r\nfile; and besides these, the base of the anal segment has ten of these\r\nlittle rough spaces, but of a different shape, being nearly linear,\r\nplaced in a double series, five on each side. Doubtless these may be\r\nregarded as a kind of _prolegs_, which enable the animal to push\r\nitself along between the bark and the wood[308].\r\n\r\nIn considering, in the next place, the _number_ and _situation_ of\r\nthe prolegs, it will contribute to distinctness to advert to these\r\ncircumstances as they occur in the different orders furnished with\r\nthese organs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the _Lepidoptera_.--Lepidopterous larvæ have either\r\nten, eight, six, or two prolegs, seldom more[309], and never fewer.\r\nOf these, with a very few exceptions, two are attached to the last\r\nor anal, and the rest, when present, to one or more of the _sixth_,\r\n_seventh_, _eighth_, and _ninth_ segments of the body: none are ever\r\nfound on the fourth, fifth, tenth, or eleventh segments.\r\n\r\n1. Where _ten_ prolegs are present, as is the case in by far the\r\ngreatest proportion of Lepidopterous larvæ, there is constantly an\r\nanal pair, and a pair on each of the four intermediate segments just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n2. In caterpillars, which like those of a few species of the genera\r\n_Sphinx_, _Pyralis_, and of the _Bombycidæ_, &c. have _eight_ legs,\r\nthey are placed in _three_ different ways. In those which have an\r\nanal pair, the remaining six are in some fixed to the sixth, seventh,\r\nand eighth; in others, to the seventh, eighth, and ninth segments. In\r\nthose which, like _Cerura Vinula_, and several other species of the\r\nsame family, have no anal prolegs; the whole eight emerge from the\r\nsixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth segments.\r\n\r\n3. The Hemigeometers, as _Noctua Gamma_, &c. have only _six_ legs:\r\nnamely, an anal pair, and two ventral ones, situated on the eighth\r\nand ninth segments.\r\n\r\n4. The larvæ of the Geometers (_Geometræ_ F.) have but _four_\r\nprolegs; of which two are anal, and two spring from the ninth\r\nsegment. It should be observed, however, that the larvæ of\r\nHemigeometers, and even of some of those that have ten prolegs, where\r\nthe four anterior ones are much shorter than the rest, move in the\r\nsame way as the Geometers. This even prevails in a few where these\r\norgans are all of equal length.\r\n\r\n5. Many of the larvæ of _Tinea_ L. which live in the interior of\r\nfruits, seeds, &c., have but _one_ pair of prolegs, which are\r\nattached to the anal segment.\r\n\r\n6. The larvæ of Haworth's genus _Apoda_ (_Hepialus Testudo_\r\nand _Asellus_ F.), remarkable for their slug-like shape and\r\nappearance, move by the aid of two lateral longitudinal pustule-like\r\nprotuberances, which leave a trace of a gummy slime in their course.\r\n\r\n_Hymenoptera._--The larvæ of the different tribes of _Tenthredo_ L.,\r\nalmost the only Hymenopterous insects in which prolegs are present,\r\nhave a variable number of these organs; some sixteen, as the saw-fly\r\nof the willow (_T. lutea_ L.), and this is the most numerous tribe\r\nof them, including the modern genera, _Cimbex_ F., _Pterophorus_,\r\n&c. Others have fourteen, as that of the cherry (_T. cerasi_ L.);\r\nand many others with only nine joints to their antennæ. A third\r\nclass have only twelve, as that of the rose (_T. Rosæ_ L.), but\r\nthis contains but few species. The last class contains those that\r\nhave no prolegs at all, but only the six horny ones appended to the\r\ntrunk. Of this tribe, the caterpillars of which have a very different\r\naspect from the preceding, are those of the genus _Lyda_ F. (_T.\r\ncrythrocephala_ L.)[310]. Two of the prolegs are anal, and the rest\r\nintermediate, and none are furnished with claws. This circumstance,\r\nin conjunction with the greater number of prolegs, except in the\r\ncase of _Lyda_, will always serve as a mark to distinguish these\r\n_fausses chenilles_, as the French call the larvæ of saw-flies, from\r\ntrue _caterpillars_. The _dorsal_ prolegs of a species of _Cynips_\r\ndescribed by Reaumur have been before noticed.\r\n\r\n_Coleoptera._--The larvæ of insects of this order are so little known\r\nor attended to, that no very accurate generalization of them in this\r\nrespect is practicable. Many of them, in addition to their six horny\r\nlegs, have a proleg at the anus; which in many cases appears to be\r\nthe last segment of the abdomen, forming an obtuse angle with the\r\nremainder of it, so as to support that part of the body, and prevent\r\nit from trailing; and in some instances, as in _Chrysomela Populi_,\r\na common beetle, secreting a slimy matter to fix itself[311]. In the\r\nlarvæ of _Staphylinidæ_ this proleg is very long and cylindrical;\r\nin that of _Cicindela_ it is shorter, and in shape a truncated cone\r\nrather compressed; it is very short, also, in those of the _Silphæ_\r\nthat I have seen. In the wire-worm (_Elater Segetum_) it is a minute\r\nretractile tubercle, placed in a nearly semicircular space, shut\r\nin by the last _dorsal_ segment, which becomes also ventral at the\r\nanus. This space is in fact the last ventral segment. This seems\r\ncharacteristic of the genus[312]. From the underside of the body of\r\nthe common meal-worm (_Tenebrio Molitor_), at the junction of the two\r\nlast segments, when the animal walks, there issues a fleshy part,\r\nfurnished below with two rather hard, long, and moveable pediform\r\npieces, which the animal uses in walking[313]. In the larva of\r\nanother beetle, whose ravages have been before noticed, under the\r\nname of the cadelle[314] (_Trogosita mauritanica_), a pair of prolegs\r\nare said to be found under the anal segment; and in that of the\r\nbloody-nose beetle (_Timarcha tenebricosa_), that segment is bifid.\r\nThat of the weevil of the common water-hemlock (_Lixus paraplecticus_\r\nF.) exhibits a singular anomaly: prolegs occupy the usual station\r\nof the true legs, being attached to the three segments representing\r\nthe trunk[315]. This insect, however, does not appear to use them\r\nin moving. A pair in each of the twelve segments of the body are\r\nfound in the grub of another weevil (_Hypera Rumicis_ Germ.), the\r\nnine last pair being the shortest, which all assist the insect in\r\nwalking[316]. But the greatest number of prolegs is to be found in\r\nthe Brazil subcortical larva lately mentioned. Besides the six horny\r\nlegs of the trunk, this remarkable animal has four prolegs on each\r\nof the seven intermediate abdominal segments, and five on each side\r\nof the base of the last, making the whole number of prolegs, if so\r\nthey may be called, amount to forty-four: a far greater number than\r\nis to be found in any larva at present known. When I wrote to you\r\nupon the motions of insects, I informed you that some larvæ moved\r\nby means of legs upon their back[317], but I was not then aware that\r\nany were furnished with them both on the back and the belly at the\r\nsame time. By the kindness of Mr. Joseph Sparshall of Norwich, a very\r\nardent and indefatigable entomologist, I am in possession of the\r\nlarva of _Rhagium fasciatum_, a timber-feeding beetle. This animal\r\non the ten intermediate segments of the underside of the body, which\r\nin the centre form a fleshy protuberance, has on it a double series\r\nof rasps, as it were, consisting each of two rows of oblique oblong\r\nprominences; and on the seven intermediate _dorsal_ segments there\r\nare also in the centre seven rasps of three or four rows each, of\r\nsimilar prominences: so that this animal at the same time can push\r\nitself along both by dorsal and ventral prolegs. It is worthy of\r\nobservation, that a pair of these rasps is between the second and\r\nthird pair of true legs.\r\n\r\n_Diptera._--The larva of a little gnat, _Tipula stercoraria_ De\r\nGeer[318] (_Chironomus_ Meig.?), drags itself along by the assistance\r\nof a _single_ tubercle, placed on the underside of the first\r\nsegment of the body, which the animal has the power of lengthening\r\nor contracting[319]. That of another beautiful _Chironomus_ (_C.\r\nplumosus_), remarkable for the feathered antennæ of the male[320],\r\nhas _two_ short prolegs, or pediform but not retractile tentacula in\r\nthe same situation[321]. Others, as that of _Tanypus maculatus_,\r\n&c. have _two pairs_, one attached to the anal and the other to the\r\nfirst segment[322]. _Tipula amphibia_ De Geer in this state has _ten_\r\nprolegs, placed by pairs on the fourth, fifth, eighth, ninth, and\r\ntenth _dorsal_ segments[323]; and _Scæva Pyrastri_ F., one of the\r\naphidivorous flies, has not fewer than _forty-two_, arranged in a\r\nsextuple series, seven in each row[324].\r\n\r\nIt may not be useless to close this long description of the _legs_ of\r\nlarvæ with a tabular view of them, founded chiefly upon these organs;\r\nwhich afford very obvious marks of distinction.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Larvæ without legs.\r\n\r\n    i. With a corneous head of determinate shape (coleopterous and\r\n        hymenopterous _apods_--_Culicidæ_, some _Tipulidæ_, &c.\r\n        amongst the _Diptera_).\r\n\r\n    ii. With a membranaceous head of indeterminate shape (_Muscidæ_,\r\n        _Syrphidæ_, and other _Diptera_).\r\n\r\nII. Larvæ with legs.\r\n\r\n    i. With legs only, and with or without an anal proleg\r\n        (_Neuroptera_, and many _Coleoptera_).\r\n\r\n            1. Joints short and conical (_Elater_, _Cerambycidæ_,\r\n                &c.).\r\n\r\n            2. Joints long and subfiliform (_Staphylinus_,\r\n                _Coccinella_, _Cicindela_, &c.).\r\n\r\n    ii. Prolegs only (many _Tipulidæ_, and some subcutaneous\r\n        Lepidopterous larvæ, &c.).\r\n\r\n    iii. Both legs and prolegs (_Lepidoptera_, _Tenthredinidæ_, and\r\n        some _Coleoptera_).\r\n\r\n            1. Without claws (_Tenthredinidæ_, &c.).\r\n\r\n            2. With claws (_Lepidoptera_, &c.).\r\n\r\nI should next say something upon the spiracles, or breathing-pores,\r\nor any other external apparatus for the purpose of _respiration_,\r\nin larvæ; but I think it will be best to reserve the consideration\r\nof these for a subsequent Letter. We will therefore conclude this\r\ndetailed description of their parts in their first state, with some\r\naccount of their other.\r\n\r\niii. _Appendages._ The generality of larvæ have no other\r\nexternal organs than those already described; but in several\r\nof them we observe various kinds of retractile ones and\r\nothers--protuberances--horn-like processes--rays, &c.; which, though\r\nnot properly coming either under any of the above _parts_, or under\r\nthe _clothing_ of these animals, yet require to be noticed. Upon\r\nthese I shall now enlarge a little.\r\n\r\nYou must have observed upon the back of the last segment but one\r\nof the caterpillar of the silk-worm a horn-like process, rising at\r\nfirst nearly perpendicularly, and then bending forward. A similar\r\nhorn, though confined in the genus _Bombyx_ to the silk-worm and a\r\nfew others, if we may believe Madame Merian, who, however, often\r\nmakes great mistakes, is found in the beautiful caterpillar of one\r\nof the largest and finest moths that we know (_Erebus Strix_[325]),\r\nthe glory of the _Noctuidæ_, and in most of those of the hawk-moths\r\n(_Sphinx_ F.) [_S. Porcellus_, _Vitis_, and a few others excepted; in\r\nsome of which, as _S. Labruscæ_, &c., this anal horn is replaced by\r\na gibbosity, and in others, as _S. Œnotheræ_, by a callous eye-like\r\nplate[326]] in the same situation, but much longer[327], and\r\ncommonly curving backwards over the tail[328]. Sometimes, however,\r\nas in _S. ocellata_ and _S. Stellatarum_, it is perfectly straight.\r\nThese organs towards the apex are horny, and often end in a sharp\r\npoint; nearer the base they are fleshy. They are without any true\r\njoint[329], yet the insect can elevate or depress them at pleasure.\r\nUnder a lens, they usually appear covered with spinous eminences,\r\narranged like scales. The use of these horns is quite unknown:\r\nGoedart fancies that they secrete a potent poison, and are intended\r\nas instruments of defence; but both suppositions are altogether\r\nunfounded. It has been remarked, that the body of those caterpillars\r\nwhich have these horns, is firmer, and yields less to the touch\r\nthan that of those which have no such appendages[330]. The larva of\r\na small timber-devouring beetle (_Lymexylon dermestoides_ F.) has,\r\nlike the above caterpillars, a long horn, and in the same situation:\r\nit has also a singular protuberance on the first segment[331]. Upon\r\nsome other caterpillars, as in _Bombyx Stigma_ F., a singular pair of\r\nhorn-like appendages arises from the back of the second segment of\r\nthe body, excluding the head. In a tawny-coloured one from Georgia,\r\nwith a transverse row of short black spines on each segment, these\r\nhorns are half an inch long, black, covered with spinous eminences,\r\nrather thickest at the base, and terminate in a little knob. They\r\nappear to articulate with the body at the lower extremity. I have\r\nanother species, black, with narrow longitudinal yellow stripes, in\r\nwhich these horns are of equal thickness at base and apex, but with\r\nthe same terminal knob. _Danais Archippus_ has a pair of tentacula\r\nat the head, and another pair, but shorter, at the tail; and _D.\r\nGylippus_ has, besides these, two in the middle of the body[332].\r\n\r\nWe are equally ignorant of the use of the upright horn found upon the\r\nback of the fourth segment in the larva of some moths (_Noctua Psi_,\r\nand _tridens_ F.) which is of a construction quite different from that\r\nof those last described. It is cylindrical, slightly thinner at the\r\napex, which is obtuse, fleshy, incapable of motion, of a black colour,\r\nand about two lines long. On the same segment, also, in the case-worms\r\n(_Trichoptera_ K.) are three fleshy conical eminences, which the animal\r\ncan inflate or depress, so that they sometimes totally disappear,\r\nand then in an instant swell out again. When retracted, they form a\r\ntunnel-shaped cavity, varying in depth[333]. Reaumur conjectured that\r\nthese eminences were connected with respiration, and one circumstance\r\nseems in favour of this conjecture, that this segment has not the\r\nrespiratory threads observable in the subsequent ones. Latreille\r\nmentions certain fleshy naked eminences placed upon the ninth and tenth\r\nsegments of some hairy caterpillars, which, like those just mentioned,\r\nthe animal can elevate more or less. They are often little cones;\r\nbut when it would shorten them, the summit is drawn in, and a tunnel\r\nappears where before there was a pyramid[334].\r\n\r\nIn a former Letter I gave you a short account of the remarkable\r\nY-shaped, as it should seem, scent-organs (_Osmateria_) of the\r\nbeautiful caterpillar of the swallow-tailed butterfly (_Papilio\r\nMachaon_ L.), and others of the _Equites_[335]; I will now speak\r\nof them more fully. That found in the former is situated at the\r\nanterior margin at the back of the first segment, close to the head,\r\nfrom which at first view it seems to proceed. At the bottom it is\r\nsimple, but divides towards the middle, like the letter Y, into two\r\nforks, of a fleshy substance[336], which it can lengthen, as a snail\r\ndoes its horns, to five times their ordinary extent, or retract\r\nthem within the stalk, so as wholly to conceal them. Sometimes it\r\nprotrudes one fork, keeping the other retracted; and often withdraws\r\nthe whole apparatus for hours together under the skin, and its place\r\nis only marked by two tawny-coloured dots, so that an ordinary\r\nspectator would not suspect the existence of such an instrument[337].\r\nUnfortunately this larva is rare in this country, so that I can\r\nscarcely flatter you with the hope of seeing this curious organ in\r\na living specimen[338], unless you choose to import a parcel of its\r\neggs from the south of Europe, where it is common. This you will\r\nthink rather a wild proposition; but why should not Entomologists\r\nimport the eggs of rare insects, as well as botanists the seeds of\r\nrare plants? But if you will be satisfied with the dissection of a\r\ndead specimen, I have several, done by the ingenious Mr. Abbott of\r\nGeorgia, in which this part is well exhibited[339].\r\n\r\nAnother small caterpillar, as it should seem, of a geometer, prepared\r\nby the same gentleman, exhibits a pair of similar horns on the fifth\r\nand sixth segments: in these the common base from which the fork\r\nproceeds is very short and wide, and each branch grows gradually more\r\nslender from the base to the apex, where it is involute. Whether\r\nthese are retractile, or whether they correspond with those of _P.\r\nMachaon_ in their nature and use, cannot be ascertained from a dead\r\nspecimen: as they belong to a larva of a quite different tribe of\r\n_Lepidoptera_, the probability is, that they essentially differ. Two\r\nglobose retractile vesicles issue from the ninth and tenth segments\r\nof those of _Arctia chrysorrhea_, &c.[340]\r\n\r\nA great number of Lepidopterous larvæ, particularly those which are\r\nsmooth and of a moderate size, have between the under-lip and fore-legs\r\na slender transverse opening, containing a teat-like protuberance of\r\nthe same construction as the furcate horn of the caterpillar of the\r\nbeautiful mountain-butterfly, _Parnassius Apollo_; and, like that, can\r\neither be wholly retracted and concealed, or by pressure be extended\r\nto the length of one of the legs. In some larvæ this part is of a\r\nsubhemispherical figure, generally single, but sometimes double. It is\r\ncommonly, however, more slender and conical; and when of this shape, it\r\nis sometimes quadruple[341]. The use of this part is not very clearly\r\nknown: some have supposed it to be a second spinneret, and to be of use\r\nin fabricating the cocoon; but it is more probable that it secretes\r\nsome other kind of fluid, and is connected with defence.\r\n\r\nThe singular organ in a similar situation, evidently for that\r\npurpose, with which the puss-moth endeavours to annoy its assailants,\r\nhas been described in a former Letter, to which I refer you[342].\r\nBonnet, who was the first that discovered this organ, ascertained\r\nthat it might be cut off without injury to either larva or imago. He\r\nalso remarked in a caterpillar found in the wild succory (_Cichorium\r\nIntybus_) another short, black, needle-shaped organ between the\r\nconical part just described and the under-lip[343]. De Geer mentions\r\na remarkable fleshy horn-like style, which issues from the lower\r\nside of the first segment, between the head and the legs of the\r\ncase-worms (_Trichoptera_): he does not describe it as retractile, or\r\nit might be regarded as analogous to those of _Lepidoptera_ similarly\r\nsituated, that I have just noticed[344]. In that of the emperor-moth\r\n(_Saturnia Pavonia_), there are perforated tubercles, which when the\r\nanimal is molested spirt forth a transparent fluid[345].\r\n\r\nThe horn-like appendage of the puss-moth (_Cerura Vinula_) is\r\nsituated at the tail of the insect, and is composed of two distinct\r\ncylindrical diverging branches, each about four lines long, not\r\nunited at the base. Each of these is hollow, and includes a smaller\r\ncylindrical piece, which can be protruded at pleasure, and withdrawn\r\nagain, as a pencil within its case; or, rather, as the horns of a\r\nsnail. The two outer horns are tolerably firm, moveable at their\r\nbase, and beset with black spines; the interior tentacula are\r\nfleshy, moveable in every direction, and in full-grown larvæ of a\r\nrose colour. The animal seldom protrudes them, unless in some way\r\ndisturbed; and frequently it approximates the two outer cases so\r\nclosely that they resemble a single horn. It appears to use these\r\ninner horns, when protruded, as a kind of whip to drive away the\r\nflies, especially the Ichneumons, that alight upon its body. When\r\ntouched in any place, it will unsheath one of them, and sometimes\r\nboth, and with them strike the place where it is incommoded[346]. A\r\nsimilar organ is found in some other _Bombycidæ_, as _B. Tau_ and\r\n_Furcula_ F. Reaumur mentions a caterpillar that to this kind of\r\ntail added the resemblance of two ears, or two cylindrical bodies,\r\nterminating in a point, which emerged from the first segment behind\r\nthe head[347]. In another observed by the same author, the legs were\r\nreplaced by a single horn, but which did not appear to send forth\r\nan internal one: from the back of its fourth segment also emerged a\r\nsingle conical or pyramidal fleshy eminence or cleft, terminating in\r\ntwo points[348]. Some of the tropical butterflies also, as may be\r\nseen in the figures of Madame Merian, have two diverging anal horns\r\ninstead of anal prolegs; but it does not appear that they incase\r\ntentacula[349]. Wherever these caudal horns are found, the above\r\nprolegs are wanting[350]. Two conical anal horns also distinguish\r\nthe caterpillar of one of the moths called _Prominents_, _Notodonta\r\ncamelina_; but these are not terminal, but on the back of the last\r\nsegment but one[351]. In that of another British moth, _N. ziczac_\r\nF., there are three dorsal prominences, one near the anus, and two\r\nmore in the middle[352]. Some Geometers (_G. fuliginosa_, &c.) have\r\ntwo erect horns on the eleventh segment, and others (_G. syringaria_,\r\n&c.) two recurved ones on the eighth[353]. I must not here omit to\r\nmention the curious hooks emerging from two tubercles on the back\r\nof the eighth segment of the ferocious larva of that beautiful\r\ntiger-beetle, the _Cicindela campestris_ L., not uncommon on warm\r\nsunny banks. This animal with incessant labour, as we are informed\r\nby M. Desmarets, digs a cylindrical burrow, to the enormous depth,\r\nthe size of the animal considered, of eighteen inches. To effect\r\nthis, it carries out small masses of earth upon its large concave\r\nhead; and having often occasion to rest in ascending this height, by\r\nmeans of these hooks[354] it fixes itself to the sides of its burrow,\r\nand, having finally arrived at its mouth, casts off its burthen.\r\nWhen these insects lie in wait for their prey, their head, probably\r\nin conjunction with the first segment of the body, accurately stops\r\nthe mouth of the burrow, so as to form an exact level with the\r\nsurrounding soil; and thus careless insects, walking over it without\r\nperceiving the snare, are seized in a moment and devoured[355].\r\n\r\nAnother kind of appendage, which is found in some larvæ, is the organ\r\nemployed by them to carry the excrement; with which, instead of letting\r\nit fall to the ground, they form a kind of umbrella to shelter and\r\nprobably conceal them. All the tortoise-beetles (_Cassida_ L.) have\r\ninstruments for this purpose, as well as an Indian genus (_Imatidium_\r\nLatr.) very nearly related to them. This instrument is a kind of fork,\r\nhalf as long as the body, consisting of two branches, growing gradually\r\nsmaller from the base to the summit, where they terminate in a very\r\nfine point, of a substance rather horny, and attached to the body near\r\nthe anal orifice. They are armed on the outside with short spines,\r\nfrom the base for about a third of their length. When this fork, as it\r\nusually is, is laid parallel to the back, with its points towards the\r\nhead, the anal aperture points the same way. When the animal walks, the\r\nfork points the other way, and is in the same line with the body, and\r\nthe anus assumes a prone position[356].\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of a genus of flies (_Volucella_ Geoffr.) remarkable for\r\ninhabiting the nests of humble bees, are distinguished on their upper\r\nside by six long, diverging, pointed, membranous radii; placed in a\r\nsemicircle round the anus[357]: what the particular use of these organs\r\nmay be, has not been conjectured. Another in my collection has only\r\nfour upper radii, but below the anus are two fleshy filiform tentacula.\r\nOne of a Tipulidan described by Reaumur, has also four upper teeth;\r\nbut instead of two subanal tentacula, has six[358]. The singular larva\r\nof another of this tribe (_Chironomus plumosus_) has on the two\r\nlast segments four long, fleshy, filiform, flexible tentacula, often\r\ninterlaced with each other; which, according to the same illustrious\r\nauthor, are used by the animal to fix its caudal extremity, like\r\nthe geometers, that the other end may be at liberty. Besides these\r\norgans round the anus, it has also four other oval ones, of uncertain\r\nuse: not to mention the two prolegs, which M. Latreille thinks are\r\nair-tubes[359]. Jointed anal organs are observable in other larvæ:\r\nthose in that of a saw-fly described by De Geer (_Lyda_ F.) consist\r\nof three joints[360]; in that of _Hister cadaverinus_, a carnivorous\r\nbeetle, of two[361]. The larva as well as the pupa and imago of\r\n_Ephemera_ is furnished with three long diverging multiarticulate\r\ntails, which are probably useful as a kind of rudder to assist and\r\ndirect their motions. That of the smaller dragon flies (_Agrion_ F.)\r\nis furnished with three long vertical laminæ, by moving which, as fish\r\ndo their tails, from side to side, the animal makes its way in the\r\nwater[362]. That singular one, also, with a hooked head, figured by\r\nReaumur, has a single swimming lamina, or fin, shaped like a fan, and\r\nplaced in a vertical position under the tail[363].\r\n\r\nThe whole circumference of the body in some coleopterous larvæ,--for\r\ninstance, in that of the tortoise-beetle lately mentioned,--is\r\nsurrounded with appendages like rays. These are sometimes simple, rough\r\nwith very short spinous points[364]; but I have a dipterous larva,\r\nin which these radii themselves are beautifully pinnated by a fringe\r\nof longish spines on each side. Reaumur has described the grub of a\r\nbeetle, the genus of which is uncertain, and which feeds upon the larva\r\nof _Aleyrodes Proletella_, whose body is margined on each side by eight\r\ntriangular fleshy mammular processes, terminating each in a bristle,\r\nwhich give it a remarkable aspect[365]. The curious scent-organs with\r\nwhich the larva of _Chrysomela Populi_ is fringed have been before\r\nfully described; and therefore I shall only mention them here[366].\r\n\r\nIn the larvæ of the lace-winged flies (_Hemerobius_), and ant-lions\r\n(_Myrmeleon_), the anus is furnished with a small fleshy retractile\r\ncylinder, from which proceeds the silken thread that forms the cocoon\r\ninclosing the pupa[367]. Providence has many different ways of\r\nperforming the same operation. From the structure of the oral organs\r\nof these animals, the silk could not conveniently be furnished by the\r\nmouth; the Allwise Creator has therefore instructed and fitted them\r\nto render it by a spinneret at the other extremity of the body.\r\n\r\nThe respiratory anal appendages of many Dipterous larvæ will be\r\nfully described in a subsequent Letter: I shall therefore now only\r\nfurther observe upon this subject, that although there is seldom any\r\nalteration in the form of these appendages &c. in the same species,\r\nthe caterpillars of two moths (_Cerura Vinula_ and _Attacus Tau_),\r\nhowever, are exceptions. The former, when young, has two hairy\r\nprojecting ear-like protuberances, which it entirely loses, as I have\r\nmyself observed, before it assumes the pupa; and the latter, in like\r\nmanner, after its third change of skin, is deprived of its bent\r\nthorn-like points which attend it when young[368]. It is remarkable\r\nthat these last larvæ, when just excluded from the egg, are also\r\nentirely destitute of these appendages; they soon, however, appear,\r\nfrom slight elevations which mark their situation, and rapidly\r\nacquire their usual form[369]. Changes of a similar kind, hitherto\r\nunobserved, may probably take place in other species.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. _Figure._ I am next to consider the general figure or shape of\r\nlarvæ. All of them, with but few exceptions[370], agree in having a\r\nbody more or less constricted at intervals into a series of rings\r\nor _segments_; usually in number, _twelve_; often nearly equal in\r\nlength, but sometimes in this respect very dissimilar[371]. The general\r\noutline or shape of the body is extremely various: most frequently\r\nit approaches to cylindrical, as in most of the caterpillars of\r\n_Lepidoptera_, and of the Hymenopterous tribe of saw-flies (_Tenthredo_\r\nL.). The next most common figure is that more or less oblong or oval\r\none, sometimes approaching to conical, found in many of the larvæ\r\nusually called grubs; such as those of the weevil (_Curculio_ L.) and\r\nof the capricorn (_Cerambyx_ L.), and other coleopterous tribes; of\r\nbees, and all Hymenopterous insects but the saw-flies; and also of a\r\nlarge number of flies (_Diptera_). In some the figure approaches to\r\nfusiform, as in most of the moths of the Fabrician genus _Lithosia_.\r\nIn others, as in those of the water-beetles (_Dytiscus_, &c.), it\r\napproaches to an obovate shape, being widest towards the head, and\r\nterminating in a point at the anus. In others, again, it is linear; an\r\nexample of which is that of _Staphylinus_. Some are convex, and others\r\ngibbous, above, and flat underneath; as those of _Silpha_, _Chrysomela_\r\nand many other beetles. Others are flat, both above and below, and\r\ndepressed like a leaf; a remarkable instance of which has been before\r\nnoticed[372]. Some are very long, as those of most _Lepidoptera_;\r\nothers very short, as that of the ant-lion (_Myrmeleon_). Many other\r\npeculiarities of form in individuals might be instanced; but a dry\r\nenumeration of these would be of no great use to you. They can only be\r\nadvantageously learned by the study of good figures, and by watching\r\nthe actual metamorphosis of the singularly-formed larvæ that you meet\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nInstead, therefore, of any further specification of individual forms,\r\nI shall now endeavour to give you, as far as my own knowledge of them\r\nand the information I can collect from other sources will enable me,\r\na larger and more general view of the kinds of larvæ; for analytical\r\ninquiries lose half their value and importance unless we proceed to\r\napply them synthetically, by forming, if possible, into groups the\r\nobjects with which we are individually acquainted.\r\n\r\nPartial attempts at a synthetical arrangement with regard to the\r\nlarvæ of _Lepidoptera_ and the saw-flies (_Tenthredo_ L.) have been\r\nmade both by Reaumur and De Geer. M. Latreille also has recently\r\ngiven a _Tableau méthodique et général_ of articulated animals\r\nfurnished with jointed legs, considered in their first state[373].\r\nThe former of these is chiefly founded upon the number of the\r\nprolegs, and the latter upon the metamorphosis, prolegs, habits,\r\nhead, and parts of the mouth, without any other notice of the\r\nconfiguration. Mr. Wm. MacLeay, who, though young in years, is old in\r\nscience and critical acumen, has started a perfectly new hypothesis\r\nupon this subject. In the progress of his inquiries into the natural\r\narrangement of animals, particularly of _insects_ in the _Linnean_\r\nsense, he has been the first to observe, that the relation which\r\norganized objects bear to each other is of two kinds; one of real\r\n_affinity_, and the other only of _analogy_, or resemblance. This\r\nimportant distinction, upon which I shall enlarge in a future Letter,\r\nwhen I come to treat of Systems of Entomology, he has applied, in\r\na way quite original, to larvæ in general, but more particularly\r\nto those of the _Coleoptera_ order. For the basis of his system he\r\nassumes a relation of analogy between the _larvæ_ of Insects that\r\nin the progress of their metamorphosis assume wings, and those that\r\ndo not, which form his class _Ametabola_, so that the prototypes\r\nof the former shall be found amongst the latter[374]. But though\r\nMr. MacLeay appears to consider the analogy between these two as\r\n_primary_, he extends it in a _secondary_ sense to the _Crustacea_,\r\nat least in several instances[375]. Upon this occasion he very\r\njudiciously remarks, that \"in terming larvæ _Chilognathiformes_\r\nor _Chilopodiformes_, it is not meant that they are _Scolopendræ_\r\nor _Iuli_, or even near to them in affinity; but only that they\r\nare so constructed that certain analogical circumstances attending\r\nthem strongly remind us of these _Ametabola_[376].\" This remark you\r\nwill bear in mind while I am treating of this subject. It should\r\nseem from another part of the same paragraph, that the comparison\r\nwhich our learned Physiologist recommends, is between the _young_\r\nof the _Ametabola_ and the larvæ of the corresponding groups of\r\n_Coleoptera_. This must be understood to refer chiefly to the young\r\nof the _Chilopoda_ and _Chilognatha_, since they approach nearer\r\nto them in that state, having then only six legs; but the rest of\r\nthe _Ametabola_ should certainly be brought to this comparison in\r\ntheir adult state: and even the two former orders in that state\r\nmore strongly resemble numerous coleopterous larvæ, than when they\r\nare young and much shorter. I before called your attention to the\r\nremarkable circumstance that contrasts very many larvæ of Hexapod\r\ninsects that become winged in their perfect state with adult\r\n_Myriapoda_: namely, that in one the progress to this state is by\r\nlosing their prolegs and shortening their body; while in the other,\r\nthe reverse of this takes place, numerous prolegs and additional\r\nsegments being gained before they arrive at maturity[377]. As the\r\nmultiplication of organs is a sign of imperfection, it may be\r\naffirmed of the former of these tribes, that their progress is\r\ntowards greater perfection; while that of the other may be called a\r\ndegradation. As larvæ may be regarded as a stepping-stone by which\r\napproach is made from the apterous to the winged tribes of Insects,\r\nit seems most consistent with general analogy that each should\r\nconnect with the other in that state in which the resemblance is\r\ngreatest. Now the _Myriapoda_ resemble larvæ, as we have just seen,\r\nmost when in their _adult_ state; therefore the comparison should be\r\nbetween larvæ and adult _Myriapoda_.\r\n\r\nMr. MacLeay divides _coleopterous_ larvæ into five tribes thus\r\ncharacterized:--\r\n\r\n1. _A carnivorous hexapod larva, with an elongate linear flattened\r\nbody, having a large head armed with two sharp falciform mandibles,\r\nand furnished with six granular eyes on each side._ This kind he\r\ndenominates _Chilopodiform_, as having for its type in the _Ametabola_,\r\n_Scolopendra_ L. The examples he gives are _Carabus_ and _Dytiscus_.\r\n\r\n2. _A herbivorous hexapod larva, with a long and almost cylindrical\r\nbody, so fashioned that the posterior extremity being curved under\r\nthe breast, the animal when at rest necessarily lies like an IULUS\r\non its side._ This tribe he denominates _Chilognathiform_, from\r\n_Iulus_ L. His examples are, the larvæ of _Petalocerous_ insects, as\r\n_Scarabæus_ L., _Lucanus_ L. &c.\r\n\r\n3. _An apod larva, having scarcely the rudiments of antennæ, but\r\nwhich is furnished instead of feet with fat fleshy tubercles; which,\r\nwhen continued along the back and belly, give the animal a facility\r\nof moving in whatever way it may be placed._ These he denominates\r\n_Vermiform_, from certain of the _Vermes intestina_ and _Mollusca_ of\r\nLinné which he has associated with his _Annulosa_[378]. His examples\r\nare, _Curculio_ L. and _Cerambyx_ L.\r\n\r\n4. _A hexapod and distinctly antenniferous larva, with a subovate\r\nrather conical body, of which the second segment is longer and of\r\na different form from the others, so as to give the appearance\r\nof a thorax._ His denomination for these is _Anopluriform_, from\r\n_Pediculus_ L., forming Dr. Leach's _Anoplura_. His examples are,\r\n_Coccinella_ and _Chrysomela_ L.\r\n\r\n5. _A hexapod antenniferous larva of an oblong form, having like\r\nthe former vestiges of a thorax, besides two or more articulated or\r\ninarticulated setaceous or corneous appendages to the last segment of\r\nthe abdomen._ This tribe he calls _Thysanuriform_, from _Lepisma_ and\r\n_Podura_ L., forming M. Latreille's order _Thysanura_. His example is\r\n_Meloe_ with a note of interrogation[379].\r\n\r\nThe system here stated, of naming and characterizing larvæ from the\r\nresemblance and analogy, in many cases very striking, that they bear\r\nto the apterous tribes, is a very happy and original one, and does\r\nits author great credit; yet I think in some instances, as I shall\r\nsoon have occasion to point out to you, the application of it is\r\nnot so happy as the first idea. But this is always the case when a\r\nnew law of nature is discovered; the proper application of it is\r\ngradually developed, and it does not at all detract from the merit of\r\nthe first discoverer, that all the bearings of such law do not strike\r\nhim as it were intuitively.\r\n\r\nHaving, however, got the vantage-ground afforded by this discovery\r\nof my friend, let us see if by standing upon it we cannot get a\r\ntolerable generalization of the larvæ of all orders of insects\r\nthat undergo a metamorphosis. But first I must observe, that as in\r\nthe perfect animals, so in their larvæ, the different groups are\r\nconnected by certain _transition_ species, exhibiting characters\r\ncommon to two or more of them; and likewise that in many cases, which\r\nyou will see as we proceed, the analogy is as strong or stronger\r\nbetween them and the _Crustacea_ (and in a few instances _Arachnida_,\r\nand even _Mollusca_) than the _Ametabola_. My denominations,\r\ntherefore, will be taken from those tribes where the analogy appears\r\nto me the most striking, and not from the _Ametabola_ alone.\r\n\r\nI shall begin by drawing up for you a list of the Primary forms\r\nthat I seem to have observed, and their characters; and then going\r\nthrough the orders, shall give you the examples of each, with such\r\nobservations upon them as the case may require.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Primary Forms of Larvæ._\r\n\r\n     APTERA.

Example: _Psocus_, _Coccinella_, most\r\n        _Hemiptera_[380].\r\n\r\n  2. _Thysanuriform._ Polyphagous; hexapod; antenniferous: body\r\n        with segments of trunk distinctly marked; anus often\r\n        furnished with setæ or mucro. Ex. _Meloe_[381]? _Thrips_,\r\n        _Aphis_.\r\n\r\n  3. _Chilopodiform._ Carnivorous; subhexapod; antenniferous: body\r\n        depressed, elongate, linear, with falcate acute mandibles,\r\n        a distinct thoracic shield, and an anal proleg. Ex.\r\n        _Cicindela_[382]? _Carabus_ L.\r\n\r\n  4. _Chilognathiform._ Herbivorous; body subcylindrical,\r\n        elongate, linear; no thoracic shield; often many prolegs,\r\n        sometimes a retractile one, and sometimes none.--Ex.\r\n        _Elater_, _Petalocera_, most _Lepidoptera_, _Tenthredo_\r\n        L.[383]\r\n\r\n  5. _Vermiform._ Polyphagous; apod or hexapod: with very short\r\n        legs; antennæ nearly obsolete; body fleshy, plicate, with\r\n        sides often plicato-papillose; no distinct thoracic shield.\r\n        Ex. _Curculio_ L., _Cerambyx_ L., _Musca_ L., and many other\r\n        _Diptera_[384].\r\n\r\n  6. _Araneidiform._ Carnivorous; hexapod: body very short;\r\n        mandibles long, suctorious; animal lying in wait for its\r\n        prey in a pitfall it has prepared; motion retrogressive. Ex.\r\n        _Myrmeleon_ L.[385] _Cicindela_?\r\n\r\n  7. _Isopodiform._ Saprophagous; hexapod; antenniferous, with\r\n        longer antennæ: body oblong; thoracic shield distinct; anus\r\n        styliferous or laminiferous. Ex. _Blatta_ L. _Silpha_ L.?\r\n\r\n  8. _Onisciform._ Herbivorous; polypod; antenniferous: body\r\n        short, oblong, depressed, margined. Ex. _Erycina_, _Lycæna_,\r\n        in the _Lepidoptera_, and some species of _Tenthredo_ L.[386]\r\n\r\n  9. _Idoteiform._ Subcortical; hexapod; antennæ obsolete: body\r\n        much depressed, with the last segment elongate, terminating\r\n        in three or more mucros. Ex. Larva from Brazil. Perfect\r\n        insect at present unknown.\r\n\r\nI have placed this larva, which was described above[387], amongst\r\ncrustaceous forms, because of the remarkable resemblance which the\r\nlast segment of the body bears to that of the _Idoteidæ_; but I do it\r\nwith considerable hesitation, since in other respects its type seems\r\nto be in the _Ametabola_. In its want of antennæ, very short legs,\r\nand ventral asperities, it resembles some of the _Vermiform_ larvæ;\r\nin its small head, distinct thoracic shield, and oblong shape, it\r\napproaches the _Anopluriform_; and in its very depressed body, but\r\nnot at all in other respects, the _Chilopodiform_. At any rate, it\r\nappears of a primary Type.\r\n\r\n  10. _Læmodipodiform._ Herbivorous; hexapod; antenniferous, with\r\n        long antennæ: body elongate, subcylindrical; second segment\r\n        of the trunk the longest; anterior pair of legs distant from\r\n        the other two. Ex. _Phasma_.\r\n\r\n  11. _Amphipodiform._ Herbivorous; hexapod; antenniferous, with\r\n        long antennæ: body shortish, compressed, saltatorious. Ex.\r\n        _Gryllus_ L.[388]\r\n\r\n  12. _Stomapodiform._ Carnivorous or saprophagous; hexapod;\r\n        antenniferous, with long antennæ: body elongate,\r\n        subdepressed, with raptorious hands, and abdomen wider than\r\n        the trunk; in aquatic species furnished with lateral gills.\r\n        Ex. _Mantis_, _Ephemera? Sialis?_\r\n\r\n  13. _Decapodiform._ Carnivorous; hexapod; antenniferous: body\r\n        elongate, narrow, convex, compressed, tapering towards the\r\n        tail; tail with natatorious laminæ. Ex. _Dytiscus_ L.,\r\n        _Agrion_ F.[389]\r\n\r\n  14. _Branchiopodiform._ Carnivorous?; aquatic; apod;\r\n        antenniferous: head distinct: body transparent, flexile,\r\n        furnished with a respiratory tube just above the tail. Ex.\r\n        _Culex_[390].\r\n\r\n  15. _Limaciform._ Herbivorous; apod, or with very short legs:\r\n        body ovate or obovate, slimy. Ex. _Apoda_ Haw., _Tenthredo\r\n        Cerasi_ L.\r\n\r\nThe above are the principal forms that appear to me _Primary_ (though\r\nsome doubt may rest upon the ninth and tenth); and probably others will\r\nhereafter be discovered, since at present our knowledge of the larvæ\r\nof most of the Orders is very limited. And now having given you this\r\ngeneralization of them, as far as they are known to me, I shall next,\r\nin a slight survey of those of the different orders, lay before you\r\nwhat I have further to observe upon this subject.\r\n\r\n_Coleoptera._ The _Anopluriform_ coleopterous larvæ, according to\r\nMr. W. MacLeay's view of them, include both those of _Coccinella_\r\nL., _Chrysomela_ L., and _Cassida_ L.; but this appears to me to\r\nadmit of further consideration. With regard to the two former--those\r\nof _Coccinella_ are carnivorous, those of _Chrysomela_ herbivorous;\r\nthe first is also usually more flat and depressed. As to the latter,\r\n_Cassida_[391], it seems to me to belong to a peculiar type,\r\ndistinguished not only by its radiated margin, but by the remarkable\r\ndeflected anal fork on which it carries its excrement. At present I\r\nknow no analogous form amongst the apterous tribes; I must therefore\r\nleave this without a denomination. Perhaps the larva of _Hispa_ or\r\n_Alurnus_, when known, will throw light upon this subject. The larva\r\nof _Endomychus_ agrees with that of _Coccinella_.\r\n\r\nThere are very few known larvæ that approach to a true\r\n_Thysanuriform_ type in this order: that most celebrated is the\r\none supposed to belong to _Meloe_; but the claim of this to be so\r\nconsidered, is, as we have seen, rather dubious. Should this point\r\nat last be satisfactorily ascertained, it will probably carry with\r\nit the whole tribe of vesicatory beetles. But even this animal in\r\nits _general_ structure is _anopluriform_: the only circumstance\r\nthat gives it any analogy to the _Thysanura_ being its anal setæ.\r\nMr. William MacLeay is inclined to regard some of the larvæ of the\r\n_Malacodermi_ Latr., but which of them he does not state, as probably\r\nbelonging to the tribe in question[392]. Those of _Lampyris_ and of\r\n_Telephorus_, as described and figured by De Geer[393], appear to me\r\nintermediate between the _Anopluriform_ and _Chilopodiform_ Types:\r\nthey have no anal setiform or styliform appendages, their mandibulæ\r\nare falcate, and their habits seem carnivorous.\r\n\r\nExamples of _Chilopodiform_ coleopterous larvæ are more numerous.\r\nOf this description are those of _Gyrinus_, _Cicindela_, _Carabus_,\r\nand _Staphylinus_. That of the first, indeed, appears to be the\r\nmost perfectly _Scolopendriform_ of any yet known; yet the gills\r\nor respiratory laminæ, a pair of which issues from each abdominal\r\nsegment, and two pair from the last[394], prove that there is no\r\nslight analogy between it, and indeed many other aquatic larvæ,\r\nand the _Stomapoda_ amongst the _Crustacea_. A remarkable instance\r\nof analogy with the _Decapoda_ of the same _Class_ is presented\r\nby the larva of _Dytiscus_, &c. which Mr. MacLeay considers as\r\n_Chilopodiform_, but which exhibits no other resemblance to\r\n_Scolopendræ_ than in its predaceous habits and threatening aspect.\r\nIts convex, compressed, tapering body, terminating in setæ or laminæ,\r\nis certainly much more like that of a shrimp or a prawn; to which\r\nthe older Entomologists thought it was akin[395], and after which\r\nthey named it. As Mr. MacLeay's object was, to take all his forms\r\nfrom the _Ametabola_, perhaps these larvæ will best fall in with his\r\n_Chilopodiform_ type; though in the general form of their body they\r\nmost represent a section (_Lepisma_ L.) of the _Thysanura_.\r\n\r\n_Chilognathiform_ forms are equally numerous in the Coleoptera with\r\nthe preceding. The wire-worm, or larva of _Elater Segetis_, as to\r\nshape best represents the full-grown _Iulus_[396], and those of the\r\n_Petalocera_ (_Scarabæus_ L., _Lucanus_ L.) the young one.\r\n\r\nThe most abundant of all forms in this order, is, I think, the\r\n_Vermiform_, upon which I have nothing further to remark.\r\n\r\nWith regard to _Crustaceous_ forms in _Coleoptera_, besides the\r\n_Decapodiform_ just noticed, I possess two specimens of larvæ of\r\n_Silphidæ_ which seem to exhibit a considerable analogy with the\r\n_Isopodous Crustacea_, one rather convex and the other flatter, so\r\nas to give the idea of an _Armadillo_ and of an _Oniscus_.\r\n\r\n_Strepsiptera._ Larva _Vermiform_.\r\n\r\n_Dermaptera._ Larva _Thysanuriform_. Type _Podura_ or _Sminthurus_.\r\n\r\n_Orthoptera._ Mr. MacLeay considers the larvæ of this Order as\r\nprimarily _Thysanuriform_[397], though he allows the resemblance\r\nbetween them and _Amphipoda_ to be particularly striking[398]. For\r\nmy own part, their prototypes appear to me to be in the _Crustacea_,\r\nand their analogical relations to the _Thysanura_ much more distant.\r\nI trust this will appear to you the reverse of dubious in a progress\r\nthrough the Crustaceous Orders. I begin with the _Isopoda_. Take the\r\nlarva of a _Blatta_, and place it between a _Lepisma_, or _Machilis_,\r\nand an _Oniscus_, or _Porcellio_; you will find that in shape and\r\nwidth, and the form of its anal styles, it resembles the latter\r\nmuch more than it does the former, with which it possesses scarcely\r\nany character in common, except its multiarticulate antennæ. It is\r\nremarkable, that amongst the _Blattidæ_ we meet with species that\r\nrepresent both the _Oniscidæ_ and _Armadillo_ or _Glomeris_[399], the\r\nlatter being more convex than the former. In their habits the Blattæ\r\ncertainly agree with _Lepisma_; and Dumeril, who thought the latter and\r\n_Podura_ subject to a metamorphosis, imagined they were related[400].\r\n\r\nThe Spectres of Stoll (_Phasma_ F.) are so strikingly analogous\r\nto another crustaceous tribe, the _Læmodipoda_, particularly the\r\ngenus _Caprella_, that Montagu gave one species the Trivial name of\r\n_Phasma_[401]. The jumping _Amphipodiform_ Crustacea are represented\r\nextremely well by _Gryllus_ L., and the _Stomapodiform_, particularly\r\n_Squilla Mantis_, by _Mantis_. The resemblance in this last instance\r\nis so very striking, that it cannot escape the eye of the least\r\nintelligent observer. Orthopterous insects may perhaps one day\r\nbe discovered analogous to the two other crustaceous orders, the\r\n_Decapods_ and _Branchiopods_; but at present I know of none of that\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n_Hemiptera._ The larvæ of this order, which in general resemble the\r\nperfect insect, except that they have no wings, seem most commonly to\r\nbelong to the _Anopluriform_ type[402]; but the _Aphides_, _Chermes_,\r\nand _Thrips_ may, I think, be regarded as more analogous to the\r\ngenera _Podura_ and _Sminthurus_ in the _Thysanura_[403]. I have\r\nsome suspicion that the _Nepidæ_, _Naucoris_, and the remipedes,\r\n_Notonecta_, _Sigara_, &c. may find their prototypes amongst the\r\n_Crustacea_; but my confined knowledge of the latter does not enable\r\nme to point to any individual genera or tribes that they may be\r\npresumed to represent.\r\n\r\n_Neuroptera._ As the kinds of larvæ of the different tribes\r\ncomposing this order, as it now stands, are very various, it is to\r\nbe expected that the analogical forms they represent are equally\r\nso. The _Libellulina_ MacLeay (whose metamorphosis that gentleman\r\nhas denominated _subsemicomplete_, a term warranted by their\r\nlosing in their perfect state the mask before described[404]) in\r\ntheir oral organs, particularly by their galeate _maxilla_ and\r\ndistinct _ligula_[405], have some relation to the _Orthoptera_, the\r\nprototypes of whose larvæ we have found amongst the _Crustacea_:\r\nprobably, therefore, those of the tribe in question lurk in that\r\nclass; a suspicion that receives strong confirmation from the larva\r\nof _Agrion_[406], which in its tapering body and anal natatorious\r\nlaminæ represents a shrimp. The larvæ of that very peculiar and\r\ndistinct tribe, the _Ephemerina_, appear to be intermediate between\r\nthe _Stomapodiform_ and _Thysanuriform_ types. Their natatory\r\nrespiratory abdominal laminæ seem copied from the former, and their\r\nanal diverging setæ from the latter[407]. The _Myrmeleonina_, as\r\nwell in their general form as in their motions and habits, present\r\na most singular analogy with the tribe of spiders, as does also in\r\nsome respect that of _Cicindela_. With regard to _Panorpa_, which\r\nMr. MacLeay remarks is related to _Myrmeleon_[408], and is a most\r\nferocious insect[409], as its larva has not yet been discovered,\r\nnothing certain respecting its analogical form can be asserted; but\r\nshould it, like the male fly, represent the scorpion, both orders\r\nof _Arachnida_ will have their representatives in the class we are\r\nconsidering. The _Corydalina_, as far as the larva of _Hemerobius_\r\ninstructs us, is _Chilopodiform_, but with a tendency to the\r\n_Araneidiform_ Type. The _Ametabola_ also furnish the prototype\r\nof the next tribe, the _Termitina_, which, as is evident both\r\nfrom _Psocus_ and _Termes_, are perfectly _Anopluriform_. The\r\n_Sialina_, or _Plicipennes_ of Latreille, excluding _Trichoptera_\r\nKirby, appear to me to be intermediate between the _Chilopodiform_\r\nand _Stomapodiform_ Types, and not without some relation to the\r\n_Thysanuriform_. Their pediform, jointed, respiratory abdominal\r\nappendages, their head and falcate mandibles, seem copied from\r\nthe first tribe. The same appendages considered as organs of\r\nrespiration, and their taper forks, are moulded upon the plan of the\r\n_Stomapodiform Crustacea_, and the long seta which terminates the\r\nabdomen is upon the _Thysanuriform_ plan[410].\r\n\r\n_Trichoptera._ The larvæ of this order appear also to be constructed\r\nupon a double plan. The respiratory threads observable in both the\r\nupper and under sides of the abdomen connect it with the _Stomapoda_,\r\nand its cylindrical elongate body with _Chilognathiform_ types in the\r\n_Lepidoptera_[411].\r\n\r\n_Lepidoptera._ The great majority of larvæ in this order are\r\n_Chilognathiform_, but there are exceptions to this remark. Those\r\nof the _Geometræ_ recede from this type, both in their motions and\r\nthe distance and number of their legs. In both these respects they\r\nrepresent the _Læmodipoda_ in the _Crustacea_[412]. Other caterpillars\r\nare _Onisciform_; and a third sort seem to leave the _Annulose_ type,\r\nand imitate that of the _Mollusca_, and one is figured by Madame\r\nMerian[413] which appears to tend even to the _Chilopodiform_ type.\r\n\r\n_Hymenoptera._ In this order the larvæ of the saw-flies, _Tenthredo_\r\nL., are in general _Chilognathiform_, though some are _Onisciform_,\r\nothers _Limaciform_, and those of _Lyda_ F. (_Cephaleia_ Jur.) and\r\n_Sirex_[414] have a _Vermiform_ tendency, and are a stepping-stone to\r\nthose of the rest of the order, which are all _Vermiform_ and apods.\r\n\r\n_Diptera._ The majority of this order may be set down as _Vermiform_,\r\nthough it is not improbable that some of them bear an analogy to\r\nanimals that appear far removed from the _Annulosa_. Thus, the larva\r\nof _Stratyomis Chameleon_ seems to exhibit no small resemblance to\r\nsome of the _Polypi vaginati_ in the _Acrita_ subkingdom of Mr. W.\r\nMacLeay[415]. That of _Culex_ and some others is constructed on a\r\nquite different type from the rest, and seems to possess some analogy\r\nto the _Branchiopod Crustacea_.\r\n\r\nThough some of these analogies are more striking than others, yet\r\nin almost all that I have stated there is that kind of resemblance\r\nthat could not be the result of what is called mere chance; and Mr.\r\nMacLeay, by first pointing out this plan of the All-wise Creator,\r\nand by laying down the doctrine of _analogies_ in general, as\r\ndistinguished from _affinities_ in the animal kingdom, has furnished\r\nthe believer with a new argument against those attacks of the\r\ninfidel, that would render null those proofs of the wisdom and\r\ngoodness of the Author of nature with which the animal and vegetable\r\ncreation furnish us; by affirming most absurdly, and under the\r\nmost stultifying blindness of mind, that the _creatures_ were in a\r\nmanner their own _creators_, their wants under local circumstances\r\nstimulating them to efforts that in a long course of years produced\r\nall the different forms and organizations that are now to be found\r\nin our globe. The affinities and close connexion of beings with\r\neach other, so that the ascent from low to high is usually by\r\nthe most gentle gradations, is the circumstance on which they\r\nbuild this strange and impious theory. But the fact, that certain\r\nanimals of one tribe were created with a view to certain animals\r\nof another, so as to present a striking aspect of correspondence,\r\nparallel almost with that of type and antitype, without any real\r\naffinity or approximation;--this triumphantly proves a Power above\r\nand without them, who has associated them not only in a complex\r\nchain of affinities, but has caused them to represent and figure\r\neach other, even when evidently far removed, so as to give a mutual\r\ncorrespondence and harmony to the whole, which could be produced only\r\nby a Being infinite in power and wisdom, who made all things after a\r\ngeneral preconceived plan and system.\r\n\r\n\r\niv. We are now to consider the _clothing_ with which larvæ are\r\nfurnished. Many are quite naked, and smooth or rough only with granular\r\nelevations or tubercles orderly arranged; but a very considerable\r\nnumber, especially of the _Lepidoptera_ order, are clothed with hair\r\nor bristles of different kinds, in greater or less abundance, and\r\narranged in different modes; and a proportion still smaller have their\r\nskin beset with spines or a mixture of spines and hairs. Lyonnet found\r\nthat the hairs of the caterpillar of the great goat-moth (_Cossus\r\nligniperda_) were hollow, though not to the apex: probably this is the\r\ncase with those of other larvæ, as well as with their spines. In this\r\ninstance they were set, he observes, in a corneous ring, or very short\r\ncylinder, elevated a little above the skin. The hair passes through\r\nthis ring, and appears to be rooted in a soft integument, which clothes\r\nthe skin within, and upon which the nerves form a reticular tissue,\r\nsome of which he thinks he has even seen enter the root of the hairs,\r\nwhich perhaps are organs of touch[416].\r\n\r\nOf the pilose larvæ, some, like most of those of the smaller moths\r\n(_Geometra_, _Tortrix_, _Pyralis_, &c.), have merely a few scattered\r\nshort hairs, scarcely perceptible except through a lens: others\r\n(_Odenesis potatoria_, _Lasiocampa Rubi_) are covered with down\r\nmore or less thick: in others (_Eriogaster lanestris_, _Lasiocampa\r\nNeustria_) the hair is slenderer, and more like wool; the body of\r\ntwo species which I purchased from the collection of Mr. Francillon\r\nis covered with woolly hairs, so long as to give them the appearance\r\nof a shock-dog; and Madam Merian has figured a similar one, which\r\nshe could not bring to the perfect state[417]. The hairs of many\r\n_Bombycidæ_, known commonly by the name of _hairy caterpillars_, as\r\n_Arctia erminea_, &c. are stiffer, resembling bristles; sometimes,\r\nas in _Arctia chrysorhea_, mixed with shorter ones. The hairs either\r\nspring immediately from the skin (_Noctua Aceris_, _leporina_), or,\r\nas is more general, proceed only from certain tubercular elevations,\r\nusually subhemispherical, but sometimes conical; of which a number\r\nvarying from four to twelve are found on each segment of different\r\nspecies. They seem to issue from these tubercles, as little diverging\r\nstreams from the rose of a watering-pot. In both cases, they form\r\na coating usually so dense as to conceal the body, but sometimes\r\nmore thinly set, and admitting the skin to be seen more or less\r\nbetween them. In a caterpillar of the beautiful _Arctia ocularia_,\r\nthe hairs are set upon tubercles alternately nearer the anterior and\r\nposterior margin of each segment, so as to form a dense band, the\r\nrest being naked; and in the lovely green and black one of _Saturnia\r\nPavonia_, each tubercle bears but six hairs, diverging like a star,\r\nthe central one being the longest and capitate, so that the chief\r\npart of the body appears naked. This diverging position of the\r\nhairs is most common in the thick-clothed larvæ also, but many have\r\nthem placed differently: thus, in those of _Callimorpha Caja_ and\r\n_Arctia villica_[418] they are all directed towards the tail, like\r\nthe quills of a porcupine: in some others the anterior ones point\r\ntowards the head: in that of _Eriogaster Quercus_ half of the tuft\r\nof hairs of each tubercle is directed downwards, the other half\r\nupwards: in that of _Arctia Salicis_ all the hairs point downwards,\r\nso that the belly is thickly covered, while the back is bare. Another\r\nvariation is, that the hairs of half the tubercle are sometimes\r\nvery long, while those of the other half are very short, and even\r\nof a different colour[419]. In the larva of Tussuck moths (_Laria\r\npudibunda_, _fascelina_, &c.) the hairs are collected into tufts of a\r\nsingular appearance, those on the intermediate segments of the back\r\nbeing quite level at the top, so as to resemble so many brushes;\r\nwhile those on the first and last segments are longer, and composed\r\nof feathered hairs converging to a point at their extremity, like a\r\ncommon camel-hair-pencil[420]. This last mode of arrangement prevails\r\nalso in the larva of _Noctua Aceris_; but in this the pencils\r\nare shorter, exactly wedge-shaped, and distinguished by another\r\nparticularity, that of springing directly from the skin, and not\r\nfrom a tubercle. This is also the case with the large caterpillars\r\nof _Odenesis potatoria_, which has a double row of short bundles of\r\nblack hairs on the back, intermixed with larger ones: at each end of\r\nthe body is a pencil of converging hairs, and the sides are spotted\r\nwith bundles of white ones, which with longer tawny ones are bent\r\ndownwards, so as to cover the sides of the creature[421]. Some have\r\nthe anterior aigrettes disposed like the arms of a cross, of which\r\nthe body of the caterpillar is the stem[422]. But not only is there\r\nconsiderable variety in the general arrangement of the hairs that\r\nclothe our little larvæ, the hairs themselves differ much in their\r\nkind and structure, of which I will now, before I proceed to consider\r\nspines, give you some account. Several of them are feathered like the\r\nplumes of a bird: this is the case with those of _Morpho Idomeneus_,\r\non each segment of the body of which are three blue tubercles, like\r\nso many little turquois beads, from each of which proceeds a long\r\nblack plume[423]. Other hairs terminate in a club; those of the larva\r\nof _Noctua Alni_, a specimen of which I possess taken in England,\r\nare flat and incrassated at the apex, something like the antennæ of\r\nsome _Sphingidæ_. Mad. Merian has figured the caterpillar of another\r\nmoth which feeds upon the Papaw-tree (_Carica Papaya_) with similar\r\nhairs[424]. But the most remarkable larva for the shape of its hairs\r\nis that of _Anthrenus Musæorum_, the little pest of our cabinets,\r\nwhich I noticed in a former letter[425]. All the hairs of its body\r\nare rough with minute points; but those of six diverging long tufts\r\nor aigrettes, laid obliquely on the anal extremity of the body, which\r\nthe animal when alarmed erects as a porcupine does its quills, are\r\nof a most singular structure: every hair is composed of a series\r\nof little conical pieces, placed end to end, the point of which is\r\ndirected towards the origin of each hair, which is terminated at the\r\nother extremity by a long and large conical mass, resembling somewhat\r\nthe head of a pike[426].\r\n\r\nBesides the one lately mentioned, other caterpillars are rendered\r\nstriking by the brilliant colour of the tubercles from which their\r\nhairs emerge. A remarkable instance of this is the thick large\r\ncaterpillar of a Bombyx, which feeds upon the _Psidium pyriferum_,\r\nor white Guava, figured by Madame Merian. This caterpillar, which\r\nis white, with transverse black stripes, and which has two singular\r\nlong converging curved bunches of hairs near the tail, is splendidly\r\nadorned on each side with fifty red tubercles, shining like coral,\r\nfrom which proceed six or seven long diverging hairs. Leeuwenhoeck\r\ntook these tubercles for eyes[427]. Another figured by the same\r\nlady, who mistakes it, with her usual inaccuracy, for the larva of\r\na _Lygæus_ F., and which seems by her description to be between\r\nthe _onisciform_ and _limaciform_ types, has the apparently fleshy\r\nmamillæ that project from its sides and back crowned with little\r\nhairy red globes, which give the animal a most singular and unique\r\nappearance[428]. Having thus described some of the principal modes in\r\nwhich the All-wise Creator has decked and defended these creatures\r\nwith _hairs_, I shall next give you a short account of the _spines_\r\nwith which he has armed others. The spinous larvæ are principally\r\n_lepidopterous_, and more particularly conspicuous in some tribes of\r\nthe genus _Papilio_ L., though some saw-flies and _Diptera_ are also\r\ndistinguished by them. _Vanessa Io_[429], _Atalanta_ and _Urtica_,\r\n_Argynnis Paphia_, _Urania Leilus_, and many other Butterflies, &c.\r\nare clothed with long sharp points, which claim the denomination\r\nof spines, rather than that of hairs or bristles; being horny and\r\nhard, and so stiff at the point as readily to pierce the skin. Those\r\nof the last-mentioned species, Madame Merian says, are as stiff\r\nas iron-wire[430]. They are sometimes entirely _simple_, and look\r\nlike spikes rather than spines, as in the caterpillar of _Nymphalis\r\nAmphinome_ and _Morpho Menelaus_[431]; but ordinarily they are beset\r\nwith _hairs_, or more commonly with shorter spines, which often give\r\nthem the appearance of plumes, as in _Urania Leilus_ just mentioned:\r\nsometimes these lateral spines are so long as to have the appearance\r\nof a branch of a tree; this is strikingly the case with a small\r\ncaterpillar which Captain Hancock brought from Brazil; its body is so\r\nthickly planted with spines of this description, that it absolutely\r\nwears the appearance of a forest or thicket in miniature. A singular\r\ncircumstance attends the spines of this species: in many cases a\r\nsmaller and very slender hair-like spine issues from them, resembling\r\na sting; and this accounts for an observation of Abbott's, that many\r\nAmerican caterpillars _sting_ like a nettle, raising little white\r\nblisters on the skin when accidentally or slightly touched[432].\r\nLewin has described the caterpillar of a moth found in New Holland,\r\nwhich he names _Bombyx vulnerans_, that, like these Americans, has\r\nalso the power of wounding, but in a different way. It darts out,\r\nhe says, when alarmed by the approach of any thing, from as many\r\nknobs or protuberances in its back eight bunches of little stings,\r\nwith which it inflicts a very painful and venomous wound[433].\r\nThe caterpillar of _Papilio Protesilaus_ F., if Madame Merian's\r\naccount and figure of it are correct, has its body armed with hairy\r\nspines, the extreme point of which is surmounted by a star-shaped\r\nappendage[434]. Those of a few saw-flies (_Tenthredo Pruni_ L.), and\r\nanother figured by Reaumur[435], are covered with a little forest of\r\nspines without lateral branches, but divided into a fork at the apex.\r\nSome spines are merely rough, with very short points, as those round\r\nthe head, which give so terrific an appearance to the caterpillar\r\nof the _Bombyx regalis_, of some proceedings of which I gave you an\r\naccount in one of my former letters[436].\r\n\r\nI must now say something upon the _arrangement_ of these spines.\r\nThough in a few instances so thickly set as entirely to conceal\r\nthe body of the animal, as in the case of the Brazil one lately\r\nmentioned, yet generally speaking, even when they are most numerous,\r\nthey permit the skin to be distinctly seen. Their arrangement is\r\nvarious, though always orderly: in the majority they are planted\r\nsingly, but in some caterpillars in bundles. In that of _Saturnia\r\nIo_, on each segment there are six bundles of longish, quill-shaped,\r\nsharp, slender, diverging spines, which also appear to sheath aculei.\r\nMadame Merian has figured this larva, or one very near it, as the\r\ngrub of a _Euglossa_[437], with which, though she affirms she traced\r\nit to the fly, it can have no connection. With regard to _number_,\r\nsome larvæ have only four spines on each segment; others five, others\r\nagain six, and others seven, or even eight: they are planted on the\r\nsides and back only, never on the belly. They are often more numerous\r\non the intermediate than on the anterior and posterior segments;\r\nbut sometimes the reverse of this takes place; in that of _Attacus\r\nErythrinæ_ only the head and tail are armed with spines, the rest of\r\nthe body being without any[438]; and in that of _Morpho Teucer_ there\r\nis only a single spine on the four intermediate segments[439]. They\r\nare usually all nearly of equal length; but in some cases those of\r\nthe head and tail are much longer than the rest, and remarkably so\r\nin the caterpillar of _Urania Leilus_, also beautifully plumose, and\r\ngracefully waved[440]. Those in the second and third segments are\r\nmuch longer than any of the rest in that of _Bombyx regalis_; which\r\ncircumstance gives it the terrific appearance lately alluded to. In\r\nthe family to which _Argynnis Paphia_ belongs, the larva is adorned\r\nwith two on the back of the first segment twice as long as the rest,\r\nand resembling at first sight two antennæ.\r\n\r\nThe spines, as well as the hairs of the new skin, are concealed\r\nunder the old one, and not incased in its spines; but Bonnet\r\nascertained, that if cut off very closely, the larva sometimes died\r\nin consequence, whilst no such result followed a similar operation on\r\nhairy larvæ. We learn from Reaumur[441], that some spinous larvæ of\r\nsaw-flies (_Tenthredo_ L.) lose their spines at the last change of\r\ntheir skin; and from Madame Merian, that that of _Attacus Erythrinæ_\r\nbefore mentioned loses also at the same period the six tremendous\r\nblack spikes that arm its black and yellow larvæ. The grubs of ants\r\nthat are destined to pass the winter in the larva state are hairy,\r\nbut are not so in summer[442]. The spines found in the grubs of some\r\ngad-flies (_Œstrus_ L.) are of a different kind from those above\r\ndescribed, being very minute triangular flat plates, arranged in\r\ndifferent and contrary directions[443], and serving the insect merely\r\nto change its place and fix itself[444].\r\n\r\nTwo other kinds of clothing, if so they may be called, neither\r\ncoming under the description of _hairs_ nor _spines_, are found\r\nin some other larvæ, not only amongst the _Lepidoptera_, but also\r\nin some of the other orders. _Nymphalis Populi_ and others of the\r\nsame family have larvæ furnished on the back of each segment with\r\ncylindricoconical processes of a fleshy substance, obtuse at the apex\r\nand surrounded with capitate hairs. In that of _N. Sybilla_, which\r\nhas on each segment two fleshy protuberances, they are bifurcate or\r\ntrifurcate, and also encircled at the base with a hairy tuft[445].\r\nOthers, as those of _Melitæa Artemis_, _Cynthia_, &c. have each\r\nsegment beset on the back with from seven to nine fleshy, pubescent,\r\nwedge-shaped protuberances; two larger ones projecting over the\r\nhead. Under this head, too, may be noticed, the glutinous secretion\r\nwhich clothes the grub of _Cionus Scrophulariæ_, a little weevil;\r\nand of _Tenthredo Cerasi_ L. a saw-fly, and that waxy or powdery\r\nsubstance which transpires through the skin of the larvæ of several\r\n_Aphides_, _Chermes_, _Cocci_, _Hylotoma ovata_ F., &c. The _Aphis_,\r\nwhose extensive ravages of our apple-trees (_A. lanata_) were before\r\ndescribed to you[446], is covered and quite concealed by this kind\r\nof substance, so that the crevices in the bark which they inhabit\r\nlook as if they were filled, not with animals, but with cotton. The\r\ninsect, also, that forms those curious galls produced upon the spruce\r\nfir, and which imitate its cones (_Chermes Abietis_ L., _Aphis_ De\r\nGeer) secretes a similar substance. In these and other cases of the\r\nsame kind, this matter seems to be, if I may so speak, wire-drawn\r\nthrough numerous pores in certain oval plates in the skin, more\r\ndepressed than the rest of the back, arranged regularly upon the\r\nsegments, and exhibiting minute tuberosities. When young, these\r\nanimals have more of this secretion than when more advanced: it then\r\nhangs from their anal extremity in locks[447].\r\n\r\nBut the insects most remarkable for a covering of this nature are\r\nthose _Coccidæ_ of which Bosc has made a genus under the name of\r\n_Dorthesia_. De Geer is the first author that notices them, and has\r\ngiven a description and figure of one species under the name of\r\n_Coccus floccosus_[448]. It was discovered by Modeer upon some sere\r\nfir-leaves in a thick bed of moss. Panzer has figured a second found\r\nupon _Geranium sanguineum_, which from the figure appears distinct\r\nfrom De Geer's, under the name of _Coccus dubius_[449]. Fabricius\r\nregards this as synonymous with the _Dorthesia characias_ of Bosc,\r\ninhabiting _Euphorbia characias_ in South Europe[450]. Olivier found\r\na species upon the bramble[451]. I once took one, which appears to\r\ndiffer in some respects from the preceding species, upon _Melampyrum\r\ncristatum_, and our indefatigable friend Mr. Sheppard has sent me\r\nanother, on what plant found I do not remember, which does not agree\r\nwith any that I have mentioned. The body of the animals of this genus\r\nis covered by a number of cottony or waxy laminæ which partly cover\r\neach other, and are arranged usually in a triple series: in De Geer's\r\nfigure the series appears quadruple, the lateral ones being placed\r\nobliquely. The anterior one in my specimen covered the head, and\r\nthey are all canaliculate. Above the anus are four diverging ones:\r\nthe whole are of the most dazzling whiteness. When these laminæ are\r\nremoved, the body appears divided into segments.\r\n\r\nWith respect to those larvæ which imitate slugs by the viscid\r\ncovering that besmears them and issues from their pores, we learn\r\nfrom Professor Peck that this exudation takes place as soon as they\r\nare hatched; that the animal retains its humidity although exposed\r\nto the fiercest heat of the sun, and that at the last moult the\r\nskin becomes quite clean, and free from all viscidity[452]. It is\r\nprobable that the other limaciform larvæ are similarly circumstanced.\r\nMadame Merian has figured an _onisciform_ one, the legs of which, she\r\nsays, are covered with a viscid skin: this produced a _Noctua_. Those\r\nof _Papilio Anchises_ also are slimy, and adhere to each other[453].\r\n\r\n\r\nv. Amongst other qualities which attach to larvæ, we must not\r\nomit to say something concerning their _Colour_. For though those\r\nwhich live in darkness, in the earth, in wood, in fruits, &c. are,\r\nwith few exceptions[454], of an uniform whitish colour, yet such\r\nas are exposed to the influence of the light are usually adorned\r\nwith a vast variety of tints, sometimes the most vivid that can be\r\nimagined. That the white colour of the former may be attributed to\r\nthe absence of light is proved by an experiment of M. Dorthes, who\r\nhaving forced some to live under glasses, exposed to the light, found\r\nthat they gradually became brown[455]. To attempt any classification\r\nof coloured larvæ would be in vain, since they are tinged with\r\nalmost every possible shade that can be conceived, of many of which\r\nit would be difficult to find examples elsewhere; and infinitely\r\ndiversified as to the arrangement and figure of their multiform\r\nmarkings and spots. A few general remarks, therefore, are all that\r\nyou will expect on this head. Many are of one uniform colour; while\r\na variety of tints, very different, and very vivid and distinct,\r\nornament others. Sometimes they are distributed in longitudinal rays\r\nor bands, at others in transverse ones. Sometimes they are waved or\r\nspotted, regularly or irregularly; at others they are sprinkled in\r\ndots, or minute streaks, in every possible way. Various larvæ are\r\nof the colour of the plant on which they feed, whence they are with\r\ndifficulty discovered by their enemies. Thus, a large proportion of\r\n_Lepidoptera_ are green of different shades, sometimes beautifully\r\ncontrasted with black bands; a circumstance which renders the\r\ncaterpillars of two of our finest insects of this order as lovely as\r\nthe fly: I mean that of _Papilio Machaon_ and _Saturnia Pavonia_.\r\nVery frequently the larvæ of quite different species resemble each\r\nother so exactly, in colour as well as shape, as scarcely to be\r\ndistinguishable: this sometimes takes place even where they belong\r\nto different genera, as in those of _Bombyx versicolor_ a moth, and\r\n_Smerinthus Populi_ a hawk-moth. And it sometimes happens, very\r\nfortunately for distinguishing allied species, that where the perfect\r\ninsects very nearly resemble each other, the larvæ are altogether\r\ndissimilar. Thus, the female of _Pieris Rapæ_ is so much like the\r\nsame sex of _Pieris Brassicæ_, that it might be taken for a variety\r\nof it, did not the green caterpillar of the one, and the spotted one\r\nof the other, evince the complete distinction of these butterflies.\r\n_Noctua Lactuca_, _N. umbratica_, and several other species of the\r\nsame tribe, which includes _N. Absinthii_, _Verbasci_, _Chamomillæ_,\r\n_Abrotani_, are so extremely alike, that the most practised eye\r\ncan scarcely discover a shade of difference between them, though\r\ntheir larvæ in colour and markings are constantly distinct[456].\r\nThe markings of species belonging to the same family are usually\r\ndifferent; but in some cases the latter may be prejudged from the\r\nformer. The larvæ of many of the genus _Sphinx_ L., for example,\r\nhave their sides marked by oblique streaks running from the back\r\nin a direction towards the head; and by this last circumstance\r\nthey are distinguished from those of _Bombyx versicolor_, _Attacus\r\nTau_, and others of the same tribe, which have also lateral oblique\r\nstriæ, but running from the back towards the tail[457]. The colours\r\nof individual larvæ of the same species are usually alike, but in\r\n_Sphinx Elpenor_ and some others they vary exceedingly. Many, like\r\nthose of _Lasiocampa Rubi_, _Saturnia minor_, &c., are of one colour\r\nwhen first disclosed, and assume others quite different in riper age.\r\nJust previously to _changing their skin_, the tints of most larvæ\r\nbecome as dull and obscure, as they are fresh and vivid when the\r\nchange has fully taken place; and in some instances the new skin is\r\nquite differently marked from the old one. This is remarkably the\r\ncase with the last skin of some of the larvæ of the genus _Tenthredo_\r\nL., which is entirely different from all the preceding ones. As\r\npeople when they advance far in years usually become more simple\r\nin their dress than when they were young, so the larvæ in question\r\nchange an agreeably variegated skin for one of a uniform and less\r\nbrilliant colour[458]. Madame Merian has observed with respect to\r\n_Attacus Erythrinæ_, that its caterpillar is at first yellowish,\r\nwith nine black striæ on each side: when arrived at one third of its\r\nsize, they become orange; the striæ are obliterated, and in their\r\nplace a round black spot appears on each of the eight intermediate\r\nsegments[459]. Mr. Sheppard has remarked to me, that the skin of that\r\nof _Sphinx Ligustri_, after being under ground four days, was changed\r\nfrom a vivid green to a dull red. Very rarely, however, it becomes of\r\na more brilliant hue just before entering the pupa state: thus, that\r\nof another hawk-moth (_Smerinthus Tiliæ_) changes to a bright violet;\r\nand the yellow hairs of that of _Laria pudibunda_ then become of a\r\nlovely rose colour. And here I may observe, that the hairs and spines\r\nalso, of larvæ, vary greatly in colour. They are to be met with\r\nbrown, black, red, yellow, violet, white, &c. De Geer found, that\r\nin the larva of _Cimbex nitens_ the two sides of the body were of a\r\ndifferent colour, the left being of a deep green, whilst the right\r\nside and the rest of the body were paler[460]; but as he saw only\r\na single individual, this was probably an accidental circumstance.\r\nThough the caterpillars, as I lately said, of one of the most\r\nbeautiful butterflies and moths that inhabit Britain contend with\r\nthe perfect insect in loveliness, yet in general no judgement can be\r\nformed of the beauty of the future fly from the colour of the larva;\r\nand the young Aurelian must not flatter himself always with the hope,\r\nbecause the caterpillar excites admiration by its colours and their\r\narrangement, that the butterfly or moth it is to produce will do the\r\nsame; nor ought he to despise and overlook a sombre or plain-coloured\r\nindividual of the former, under the idea that it will produce one\r\nequally plain of the latter, for it often happens that the splendid\r\ncaterpillar gives a plain butterfly or moth, and _vice versâ_. De\r\nGeer, however, gives us two instances of conformity between the\r\ncolours of the caterpillar and those of the future moth; the one is\r\nthat of the common currant-moth (_Phalæna G. grossulariata_ L.),\r\nthe caterpillar of which is white, ornamented with several black\r\nspots varying in size. At the two extremities it is yellowish, with\r\na longitudinal ray of the same colour on each side, the head and\r\nlegs being black. These colours are all to be found in the fly, the\r\nground of its wings being white ornamented with many black spots of\r\ndifferent sizes. Its upper wings are traversed by a yellowish band;\r\nand towards their base is a spot of the same colour. Its body is\r\nyellowish, with black spots; but the head and legs are black[461].\r\nThe other is that of a green caterpillar, which gives a green moth,\r\nfigured by Reaumur (_Pyralis prasinaria_ Fab.)[462]. Sometimes, also,\r\nthe sex of the future perfect insect may be predicted from the colour\r\nit exhibits in its first state: thus, the brown caterpillars of\r\n_Noctua Pronuba_ produce males, and the green ones females[463]. The\r\nsexes, also, of _N. exoleta_ and _Persicariæ_ differ in that state.\r\n\r\n\r\nvi. To the full account of the _Food_ of insects given in a former\r\nletter[464], which had reference chiefly to their larva state,\r\nit is only necessary in this place to add a few particulars not\r\nthere noticed. Many larvæ when first excluded, as those of _Pieris\r\nCratægi_, &c. devour the shells of the eggs from which they have\r\nproceeded[465]; and others (_Cerura Vinula_, _Sphinx Euphorbiæ_,\r\n_Noctua Verbasci_), though their usual food is of a vegetable nature,\r\neat with great apparent satisfaction the skins which they cast from\r\ntime to time, not leaving even the horny legs. This strange repast\r\nseems even a stimulating dainty, which speedily restores them to\r\nvigour, after the painful operation by which they are supplied with\r\nit. Under this head it will not be out of place to mention, that some\r\nlarvæ of insects, which feed only on the juices of animals, or the\r\nnectar and ambrosia of flowers, have no anal passage, and of course\r\nno feces. This is said to be the case with the grubs of bees, wasps,\r\nthe larvæ of _Myrmeleon_, &c.[466]\r\n\r\n\r\nvii. You will require no stimulus to induce you to attend to the\r\nsubject I am next going to enter upon,--the _Moulting_, namely,\r\nof Larvæ; or their changes of skin. This, indeed, is a subject\r\nso replete with interest, and which so fully displays the power,\r\nwisdom, and goodness of the Creator, affording at the same time such\r\nlarge occasion for nice investigation, that a pious and inquisitive\r\nmind like yours cannot but be taken with it. In the higher orders\r\nof animals, though the _hairs_ of quadrupeds and the _feathers_ of\r\nbirds are in many cases annually renewed, the change, or scaling\r\nand increment of the _skin_, is gradual and imperceptible; no\r\nsimultaneous rejection of it, in which it is stripped off by the\r\nanimal itself like a worn shirt, being observable, till you descend\r\nin the scale to the Serpent tribe[467], which at certain periods\r\ndisengage themselves from their old integument, and start forth with\r\nthat new and deadly beauty so finely described by the Mantuan bard:--\r\n\r\n          \"So from his den, the winter slept away,\r\n           Shoots forth the burnished snake in open day;\r\n           Who, fed with every poison of the plain,\r\n           Sheds his old spoils and shines in youth again:\r\n           Proud of his golden scales rolls tow'ring on,\r\n           And darts his forky _tongue_[468], and glitters in the sun.\"\r\n                                                                  PITT.\r\n\r\nIn these the new skin, I imagine, is formed under the old from the\r\n_rete mucosum_; but in _insects_, as I formerly stated[469], since the\r\ntime of Swammerdam it has generally been believed by entomologists,\r\nthat the larva includes a series of cases or envelopes, one within\r\nthe other, containing in the centre the germe of the future perfect\r\ninsect, whose development and final exclusion take place only when\r\nthese cases have been successively cast off. This hypothesis, as was\r\nexplained to you on a former occasion[470], has been controverted by a\r\nlate writer, Dr. Herold; who affirms that the skins of caterpillars are\r\nalso successively produced out of the _rete mucosum_. I have however,\r\nI hope, satisfied you that the old system is most consonant to nature\r\nand probability: but as we are now to enter at large upon the _Moults_\r\nof insects, it will not be without use if I add a few additional\r\nreasons which seem to me still further to prove the correctness of\r\nSwammerdam's system, as far as it relates to that subject. With regard\r\nto the mere formation of the skin from the _rete mucosum_, were this\r\nthe whole question few would hesitate to adopt the sentiments of M.\r\nHerold; but when we come to consider further--that the number of moults\r\nof individuals of the _same_ species is always the same, and that it\r\nvaries in _different_ species, and takes place at certain periods,--we\r\nbegin to suspect that something more than the mere formation of a new\r\nskin upon an old one being cast is to be accounted for; and that the\r\nlaw which prescribes its own definite number of skins to each species,\r\nmust begin to act in the primordial formation of the larva. Again,\r\nthe _hairs_ observable in the higher animals do not take their origin\r\nfrom the epidermis solely, but are planted below it in the _rete\r\nmucosum_, or deeper[471]; so that the change of skin does not affect\r\nthem; but in the larvæ of insects they are a continuation of that\r\nintegument, since, when the moult takes place, they always remain on\r\nthe rejected skin[472]: this is the case, also, even with spines. If\r\nyou shave a caterpillar ready to change its skin, either partially or\r\ngenerally, you will find that the parts in the new skin that correspond\r\nwith those that are denuded, are equally hairy with those that were\r\nnot[473]; and if you pay attention to the new-clad animal, you will\r\nfind further, that the hairs never grow after a moult. From hence it\r\nfollows, that the _hairs_ have their place and take their whole growth\r\nbetween the new skin and the old[474]. Whether the _spines_, simple or\r\ncompound, lately described to you, that arm some larvæ are similarly\r\ncircumstanced, seems not as yet to have been ascertained; but as the\r\nspinous ones of certain _Tenthredines_ L. and _Lepidoptera_ at their\r\nlast moult have no spines, the presumption is, that, whether incased\r\nor not, they are mere appendages of the skin on which they appear.\r\nA new set of hairs, therefore, and probably of spines in spinous\r\nlarvæ, accompanying each skin, and these varying very much in size,\r\ncomposition, &c. though a new membrane may be admitted to be formed\r\nfrom an action in the _rete mucosum_ without a pre-existent germe of\r\nit, it seems not easy to conceive how these hairs and spines can spring\r\nup and grow there, each according to a certain law, without existing\r\npreviously as a kind of _corculum_ or _punctum saliens_; and that the\r\ngermes of the tubercles, in which the hairs are so generally planted,\r\naccording to a certain arrangement and in a given number, should also\r\npre-exist, seems most consonant to reason. These and the several skins\r\nmay all co-exist in their primordial germes, and remain beyond the\r\ndiscovery of our highest powers of assisted vision, till a certain\r\nperiod when they may first enter the range of the microscope-aided eye.\r\nIt does not therefore follow, because these _primordia semina rerum_\r\nare not discoverable, that therefore they may not exist. Our faculties\r\nand organs are too limited and of too little power to enable us to see\r\nthe essences of being.\r\n\r\nUpon the supposition that the hypothesis of Swammerdam is the true\r\none, we may imagine that the envelope that lies within all the rest is\r\nthat which covers the insect in its pupa state. Above this are placed\r\nseveral others, which successively become external integuments. These\r\nchanges or casting of the skin in larvæ, analogous, as before observed,\r\nto that of serpents, are familiar to every breeder of silk-worms, in\r\nwhich _four_ such changes occur: the first at the end of about _twelve_\r\ndays from its birth, and the three next each at the end of _half_ that\r\ntime from the moulting which preceded it. With some exceptions[475],\r\nsimilar changes of the skin take place in all larvæ, not however in\r\nthe same number and at the same periods. Most indeed undergo this\r\noperation only three or four times; but there are some that moult\r\noftener, from five up to eight (_Arctia villica_), nine (_Callimorpha\r\nDominula_), or even ten times; for so often, M. Cuvier informs us,\r\nthe caterpillar of the tiger-moth (_Callimorpha Caja_) casts its\r\nexuviæ. It has been observed that the caterpillars of the day-flying\r\n_Lepidoptera_ (_Papilio_ L.) usually change only _three_ times, while\r\nthose of the night-flying ones (_Phalæna_ L.) change _four_[476]. The\r\nperiods that intervene between each change depend upon the length of\r\nthe insect's existence in the larva state. In those which live only a\r\nfew weeks or months, they are from eight to twenty days; while in those\r\nthat live more than a year, as the cockchafer, &c. they are probably\r\nproportionably longer: though we know very little with regard to the\r\nmoult of any insects besides the _Lepidoptera_.\r\n\r\nA day or two previously to each change of its skin, the larva ceases\r\neating altogether; it becomes languid and feeble, its beautiful\r\ncolours fade, and it seeks for a retreat in which it can undergo\r\nthis important and sometimes dangerous and even fatal operation in\r\nsecurity. Here, either fixing itself by its legs to the surface on\r\nwhich it rests, or, as is the case with many caterpillars, by its\r\nprolegs, to a slight web spun for this purpose, it turns and twists\r\nits body in various directions, and alternately swells and contracts\r\nits different segments. The object of these motions and contortions\r\nseems to be, to separate the exterior skin, now become dry and rigid,\r\nfrom the new one just below it. After continuing these operations for\r\nsome hours, resting at intervals without motion, as if exhausted by\r\ntheir violence, the critical moment arrives: the skin splits in the\r\nback, in consequence of the still more violent swelling of the second\r\nor third segment: the opening thus made is speedily increased by a\r\nsuccession of swellings and contractions of the remaining segments:\r\neven the head itself often divides into three triangular pieces, and\r\nthe inclosed larva by degrees withdraws itself wholly from its old\r\nskin. All larvæ, however, do not force their way through this skin\r\nin precisely the same place. Thus, those of the hawthorn butterfly\r\n(_Pieris Cratægi_), according to Bonnet[477] make their way out by\r\nforcing off what may be called their skull, or the horny part of\r\ntheir head, without splitting the skin, which remains entire; others\r\nhave been observed to make their way out at the side and the belly.\r\nReaumur noticed the larva of _Zygæna Filipendulæ_, previously to its\r\nlast moult, actually biting off and detaching several portions of its\r\nold skin; and before this, drops of a fluid resembling water were\r\nseen to exude from it[478].\r\n\r\nThe skin when cast is often so entire, that it might be mistaken\r\nfor the larva itself; comprising not only the covering of the main\r\ntrunk with the hairs which clothed it, but of the very skull, eyes,\r\nantennæ, palpi, jaws, and legs; which, if examined from within, are\r\nnow found to be hollow, and to have incased, like so many sheaths,\r\nsimilar parts in the new skin. That the feet of the newly-coated\r\nlarva were actually sheathed, as fingers in a glove, in the same\r\nparts of the exuviæ, may be proved by a very simple experiment: if\r\na leg of one just ready to cast its skin be cut off, the same limb\r\nwill be found mutilated when that change has ensued. The anal horns,\r\nalso, of the larvæ of the hawk-moth (_Sphinx_ L.) and other similar\r\nprotuberances, are incased in each other in like manner; but hairs\r\nare laid flat between the two skins, and contribute considerably\r\ntowards their more easy separation. Thus, if you saved the skins cast\r\nby the larva of _Callimorpha Caja_, for instance, you would appear to\r\nhave ten different specimens of caterpillars, furnished with every\r\nexternal necessary part, and differing only in size, and the colour\r\nperhaps of the hairs, and all representing the same individual.\r\n\r\nBut further changes than this take place. Swammerdam says, speaking\r\nof the moult of the grub of _Oryctes nasicornis_, a beetle common\r\nin Holland, but not satisfactorily ascertained to inhabit Britain,\r\n\"Nothing in all nature is in my opinion a more wonderful sight than\r\nthe change of skin in these and other the like worms. This matter,\r\ntherefore, deserves the greatest consideration, and is worthy to be\r\ncalled a specimen of nature's miracles; for it is not the external\r\nskin only that these worms cast, like serpents, but the throat and a\r\npart of the stomach, and even the inward surface of the great gut,\r\nchange their skin at the same time. But this is not the whole of\r\nthese wonders; for at the same time some hundreds of pulmonary pipes\r\nwithin the body of the worm cast also each its delicate and tender\r\nskin. These several skins are afterwards collected into eighteen\r\nthicker, and, as it were, compounded ropes, nine on each side of the\r\nbody, which, when the skin is cast, slip gently and by degrees from\r\nwithin the body through the eighteen apertures or orifices of the\r\npulmonary tubes before described, having their tops or ends directed\r\nupwards towards the head. Two other branches of the pulmonary\r\npipes that are smaller, and have no points of respiration, cast a\r\nskin likewise.\" ... \"If any one separates the cast little ropes or\r\ncongeries of the pulmonary pipes with a fine needle, he will very\r\ndistinctly see the branches and ramifications of these several pipes,\r\nand also their annular composition[479].\"--Bonnet makes a similar\r\nobservation with regard to _caterpillars_; but he appears to have\r\nobserved it more particularly, at least the change of the intestines,\r\npreviously to the metamorphosis of the insect, when he says with the\r\nexcrements it casts the inner skin of the stomach and viscera[480].\r\nBoth these great men appear to have recorded the result of their\r\nown actual observations with regard to the proceedings of two very\r\ndifferent kinds of insects; the one the grub of a beetle, and the\r\nother the caterpillars of _Lepidoptera_. The account of the former is\r\ngiven quite in detail, as that of a person who is describing what he\r\nhas actually _seen_: yet by a later and very able physiologist, Dr.\r\nHerold, it is affirmed that the inner skin of the intestinal canal\r\nis never cast, that canal constantly retaining its two skins. He\r\nfurther affirms, that they are only the _large_ trunks of the Tracheæ\r\nthat cast their skins, none being detached from their _smaller_\r\nramifications[481]. When men so eminent for their anatomical skill\r\nand nicety, and for their depth and acumen, disagree, the question\r\nmust be regarded as undecided till further observations throw\r\nsufficient weight into one scale or the other.\r\n\r\nThe larva which has undergone this painful process is at first\r\nextremely weak: all its parts are soft and tender; even the corneous\r\nones, as the head and the legs, are then scarcely more than membranous,\r\nand are all bathed with a fluid, which, before the moult, intervenes\r\nbetween the two skins, and facilitates their separation[482]: and\r\nit is only after some _hours_, or in some cases even _days_, during\r\nwhich it lies without motion, that this humidity evaporates, all its\r\nparts become consolidated, and it recovers its strength sufficiently\r\nto betake itself to its wonted food. Its colour, too, is usually at\r\nfirst much paler than before, and its markings indistinct, until their\r\ntints have been enlivened by exposure to the air, when they become\r\nmore fresh, vivid, and beautiful to appearance than ever. When a few\r\nmeals have invigorated its languid powers, the renovated animal makes\r\nup for its long abstinence by eating with double voracity. . A similar\r\npreparatory fast, and succeeding state of debility, accompany every\r\nchange of the larva's skin. Each time except the last, the old skin is\r\nsucceeded by a new one, with few exceptions, similar to the one it has\r\ndiscarded. Previously to the final change, which discloses the pupa, it\r\nquits the plant or tree on which it had lived, and appears to be quite\r\nunsettled, wandering about and crossing the paths and roads, as if in\r\nquest of some new dwelling. It now abstains from food for a longer time\r\nthan before a common moult, empties itself copiously, and as I have\r\njust said, if Swammerdam and Bonnet are to be depended upon, casts the\r\nskin that lines the stomach and intestines, as well as that of the\r\nTracheæ.\r\n\r\nI have observed above, that all larvæ, with few exceptions, change\r\ntheir skins in the manner that I have described. These exceptions\r\nare principally found in the order _Diptera_, of which those of\r\nthe Linnean genera _Musca_, _Œstrus_, and probably all that, like\r\nthe maggot of the common flesh-fly, have membranous contractile\r\nheads, never change their skin at all, not even preparatory to their\r\nbecoming pupæ. The skin of the pupa, though often differing greatly\r\nin shape from that of the larva, is the same which has covered this\r\nlast from its birth, only modified in figure by the internal changes\r\nthat have taken place, and to which its membranous texture readily\r\naccommodates itself. The larvæ of the Dipterous genera _Tipula_,\r\n_Culex_, and those which have corneous heads, like other larvæ\r\nchange their skins several times previously to becoming pupæ[483].\r\nThe grubs, also, of bees, wasps, ants? and probably many other\r\n_Hymenoptera_, do not change their skin till they assume the pupa,\r\nnor the larva of the female _Coccus_[484].\r\n\r\nIf you feel disposed to investigate the reasons of that law of the\r\nCreator which has ordained that the skins of the higher animals shall\r\nbe daily, and imperceptibly, and as it were piece by piece renewed,\r\nwhile those of insects are cast periodically and simultaneously,--the\r\nproximate cause must be sought for in the nature of the two kinds\r\nof skin, the one being more pliable and admitting a greater degree\r\nof tension than the other, and being so constructed as to scale off\r\nmore readily. If, ascending higher, you wish to know why the skins\r\nof insects are so differently circumstanced from our own, the most\r\napparent reason is, to accommodate the skin to the very rapid growth\r\nof these animals, which a gradual and slower change would have\r\nimpeded too much, or the skin have suffered constant dilapidation\r\nand injury; therefore their Beneficent Creator has furnished them\r\nwith one which will stretch to a certain point, and during a certain\r\nperiod, and then yield to the efforts of the inclosed animal, and be\r\nthrown aside as a garment that no longer fits the wearer.\r\n\r\n\r\nviii. And this leads me to a subject to which I am desirous now to\r\nbespeak your attention,--the _Growth_, I mean, and size of Insects in\r\nthis state. As to _size_, larvæ differ as much as insects in their\r\nperfect state: these last, however, never grow after their exclusion\r\nfrom the pupa, while larvæ increase in bulk in a proportion, and\r\noften with a rapidity, almost without a parallel in the other tribes\r\nof animals. Thus Lyonnet found, that the caterpillar of the great\r\ngoat-moth (_Cossus ligniperda_ F.) after having attained its full\r\ngrowth is at least 72,000 times heavier than when it was first\r\nexcluded from the egg[485]; and of course had increased in size in\r\nthe same proportion. Connected with the size of larvæ, is the mode\r\nin which their accretion takes place. This, with respect to the more\r\nsolid parts, as the head, legs, &c., is not, as in other animals,\r\nby gradual and imperceptible degrees, but suddenly and at stated\r\nintervals. Between the assumption of a new skin and the deposition of\r\nan old one, no increase of size takes place in these parts, while the\r\nrest of the body grows and extends itself, till, becoming too big for\r\nthese solid parts, nature restores the equilibrium between them by a\r\nfresh moult[486], in which the augmentation of bulk, especially in\r\nthese parts, is so great, that we can scarcely credit the possibility\r\nof its being cased in so small an envelope. Malpighi declares, that\r\nthe head of a silk-worm that has recently cast its skin is four times\r\nlarger than before the change[487]. It is very probable, also, that\r\nwhen the outer skin becomes rigid, it confines the body of the larva\r\nwithin a smaller compass than it would expand to if unconfined, so\r\nthat, when this compression is removed, the soft and elastic new\r\nintegument immediately swells out, and the animal appears all at\r\nonce much larger than it was before the moult. In fact, the proximate\r\ncause of the rupture and rejection of the old skin is the expansion\r\nof the included body, which at length becomes so distended as to\r\nsplit its envelope, aided, indeed, as before described, by the\r\ncontortions of the creature itself.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ most notorious for the _rapidity_ of their growth are those\r\nof _Musca carnaria_ and other flesh-flies: some of which Redi found\r\nto become from 140 to more than 200 times heavier in twenty-four\r\nhours[488]: an increase of weight and size in so short a time truly\r\nprodigious, but essential for the end of their creation--the rapid\r\nremoval of dead and putrescent animal matter. As the skins of these\r\nlarvæ are never changed, we may conclude, if the cause of the change\r\nof skin in other larvæ above surmised be accurate, that their skins\r\nare more contractile and capable of a greater degree of tension than\r\nthose of larvæ that are subject to moulting. And two peculiarities\r\nobservable in them confirm this idea: in the first place, their head\r\nis not hard and corneous, as that of the others, but capable of being\r\nshortened or lengthened; and in the next, their breathing-pores are\r\nnot in the sides, but at the extremities of the body, while in the\r\n_moulting_ larvæ there are two in almost every segment, which must form\r\nso many callous points that impede the stretching of the skin to the\r\nutmost. The hairs, spines, and tubercles, that are so often found on\r\ncaterpillars, must also form so many points of resistance that prevent\r\nthat full extension of the integument which it might otherwise admit.\r\n\r\nThere is not always that proportion between the size of larvæ and of\r\nthe insects that proceed from them that might have been supposed,\r\nsome small larvæ often producing perfect insects larger than some of\r\nthose proceeding from such as are of greater size.\r\n\r\n\r\nix. As insects often live longest in the state we are treating of,\r\nI shall say something next upon the _age_ of larvæ, or the period\r\nintervening between their exclusion from the egg and their becoming\r\npupæ. This is exceedingly various, but in every case nicely adapted\r\nto their several functions and modes of life. The grubs of the\r\nflesh-fly have attained their full growth, and are ready to become\r\npupæ, in _six_ or _seven_ days; the caterpillar of _Argynnis Paphia_,\r\na butterfly, in _fourteen_ days; the larvæ of bees in _twenty_ days;\r\nwhile those of the great goat-moth (_Cossus ligniperda_) and of the\r\ncockchafer (_Melolontha vulgaris_) live _three_ years, or at least\r\nsurvive three winters, before the same change. That of another\r\nlamellicorn beetle (_Oryctes nasicornis_ F.) is said to be extended\r\nto _four_ or _five_; that of the wire-worm (_Elater segetum_) to\r\n_five_. That of the stag-beetle (_Lucanus Cervus_) is affirmed by\r\nRösel to be extended to _six_ years; but the most remarkable instance\r\nof insect longevity is recorded by Mr. Marsham in the _Linnean\r\nTransactions_[489]. A specimen of _Buprestis splendida_, a beautiful\r\nbeetle never before found in this country, made its way out of a deal\r\ndesk in an office in London in the beginning of the year 1810, which\r\nhad been fixed there in the year 1788 or 1789; so that according to\r\nevery appearance it had existed in this desk more than twenty years.\r\nAmple allowance being made for its life as a pupa, we may conclude\r\nthat it had existed as a larva at least half the above period. The\r\ngrubs of the species of the genus _Cynips_ L. attain their full size\r\nin a short time; but they afterwards remain five or six months in the\r\ngall before they become pupæ[490].\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions it may be laid down, that those larvæ which live\r\non dead animals, in fungi, in dung, and in similar substances, are of\r\nthe shortest duration in this state; and that those which live under\r\nthe earth, on the roots of grass, &c. and in wood, the longest: the\r\nformer becoming pupæ in a few days or weeks, the latter requiring\r\nseveral months, or even years, to bring them to maturity. The larvæ\r\nwhich live on the leaves of plants seem to attain a middle term\r\nbetween the one and the other,--seldom shorter than a few weeks, and\r\nrarely longer than seven or eight months. Aquatic larvæ appear to be\r\nsubject to no general rule: some, as the larvæ of _Gnats_, becoming\r\npupæ in two or three weeks; and others, as those of the _Ephemeræ_,\r\nwhich are thus compensated for their short life as flies, in as\r\nmany years[491]. The cause of all these differences is obviously\r\ndependent on the nature of the food, and the purposes in the economy\r\nof creation to which the larvæ are destined.\r\n\r\n\r\nx. The last part of the history of larvæ relates to their _Preparations\r\nfor assuming the pupa state_. When they have acquired their full size,\r\nafter having ceased to take food, by a copious evacuation they empty\r\nthe intestinal canal, even rejecting the membrane that lines it and\r\nthe stomach[492]; their colours either change totally, or fade; and\r\nthey make themselves ready for entering upon a new stage of their\r\nexistence. Some merely rest in a state of inactivity in the midst of\r\nthe substances in which they feed, as if conscious of their inability\r\nto select any safer abode. Of this description are most Coleopterous,\r\nHymenopterous, and Dipterous larvæ, that feed under ground, or in the\r\ninterior of trees, fruits, and seeds.\r\n\r\nBut a still larger tribe, those which feed on leaves, animals, &c.\r\nact as if more sensible of the insecurity of this to them important\r\nepoch. They are about to exchange their state of vigour and activity\r\nfor a long period of deathlike sleep. The vigilant caution which\r\nwas wont to guard them from the attack of their enemies will be\r\nhenceforward of no avail. Destitute of all the means of active\r\ndefence, their only chance of safety during their often protracted\r\nnight of torpor must arise from the privacy of their place of repose.\r\nAbout this, therefore, they exhibit the greatest anxiety. Many, after\r\nwandering about as if bewildered, retire to any small hole on the\r\nsurface of the earth, covering themselves with dead leaves, moss, or\r\nthe like, or to the chinks of trees, or niches in walls and other\r\nbuildings, or similar hiding-places. Many penetrate to the depth of\r\nseveral inches under ground, and there form an appropriate cavern\r\nby pushing away the surrounding earth; to which they often give\r\nconsistence by wetting it with a viscid fluid poured from the mouth.\r\nThe larvæ of other insects undertake long and arduous journeys in\r\nsearch of appropriate places of shelter. Those of flesh-flies, now\r\nsatiated with the mass of putridity in which they have wallowed,\r\nleave it, and conceal themselves in any adjoining heap of dust.\r\nThe grubs of the gad-fly (_Œstrus_) creep some of them out of the\r\nbacks of cattle, in tumours of which they have resided, and suffer\r\nthemselves to fall to the earth; while others, which have fed in the\r\nstomach of horses, quit their hold, and by a still more extraordinary\r\nand perilous route are carried through the intestines the whole\r\nlength of their numerous circumvolutions, and are discharged at the\r\nanus. And without enumerating other instances, various aquatic larvæ,\r\nas that of a common fly (_Elophilus pendulus_), &c. leave the water,\r\nnow no longer their proper element, and betake themselves to the\r\nshore, there to undergo their metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nMost of these, having reached their selected retreat, require no other\r\nprecaution; but another large tribe of larvæ have recourse to further\r\nmanœuvres for their defence before they assume the pupa. Those of\r\nthe aphidivorous flies (_Syrphus_ F. &c.), of the various lady-birds\r\n(_Coccinella_ L.), and tortoise-beetles (_Cassida_ L.), &c. fix\r\nthemselves by the anus with a gummy substance to the leaves or twigs\r\nunder which they propose to conceal themselves during their existence\r\nin that state. Others previously suspend themselves by a silken thread\r\nfixed to the tail, or passing round the body; by which also, when\r\nbecome pupæ, they are afterwards pendent in a similar position; and\r\nlastly, a very great number of larvæ wholly inclose themselves in cases\r\nor cocoons, composed of silk and various other materials, by which\r\nduring their state of repose they are protected both from their enemies\r\nand the action of the atmosphere. As these two last-mentioned processes\r\nare extremely curious and interesting, I shall not fear tiring you by\r\nentering into some further detail respecting them: explaining _first_\r\nthe mode by which larvæ _suspend_ themselves, both before and after\r\nthey are become pupæ, by silken threads; and _next_, the various\r\n_cases_ or _cocoons_ in which others inclose themselves, and their\r\nmanner of operating in the formation of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The larvæ which suspend themselves and their pupæ, with the\r\nexception of the tribe of _Alucitæ_, and some _Geometræ_ of the family\r\nof _G. pendularia_, _punctaria_, &c. are almost all _butterflies_[493].\r\nNo others follow this mode. They may be divided into two great\r\nclasses--those which suspend themselves _perpendicularly_ by the\r\n_tail_, and those which suspend themselves _horizontally_ by means of\r\na thread girthed round their _middle_. In both cases it should be\r\nobserved, that the suspension of the pupa is the object in view; but as\r\nthe process is the work of the larva, this seems the proper place for\r\nexplaining it. To begin with the _first_ case.\r\n\r\nYou are aware that all _lepidopterous_ larvæ have the faculty of\r\nspinning silk threads from their mouths, and it will readily occur\r\nto you that it is by means of these threads that they suspend\r\nthemselves. But how? How is a caterpillar to hang itself by the\r\ntail to threads spun from the mouth? Even suppose this difficulty\r\novercome, others still greater remain. Suppose the caterpillar to be\r\nsuspended by its tail,--this is but a preparatory operation,--what\r\nis required is, that the pupa shall hang in the same position:\r\nnow when you take into consideration that it is incased _within_\r\nthe skin of the larva, and without feet or other external organs;\r\nthat it has to extricate itself from this skin; to hang itself\r\nin its place, and to detach the skin from the threads which hold\r\nit--this will appear no trifling task. Indeed at first view it seems\r\nimpossible. Country-fellows for a prize sometimes amuse the assembled\r\ninhabitants of a village by running races in sacks: take one of the\r\nmost active and adroit of these, bind him hand and foot, suspend him\r\nby the bottom of his sack with his head downwards, to the branch\r\nof a lofty tree; make an opening in one side of the sack, and set\r\nhim to extricate himself from it, to detach it from its hold, and\r\nsuspend himself by his feet in its place. Though endowed with the\r\nsuppleness of an Indian juggler, and promised his sack full of gold\r\nfor a reward, you would set him an absolute impossibility: yet this\r\nis what our caterpillars, instructed by a beneficent Creator, easily\r\nperform. Their manœuvres I shall now endeavour to explain.\r\n\r\nWhen the caterpillar has selected the under-side of the leaf or\r\nother object to which it purposes suspending itself, its first\r\nprocess is to spin upon it a little hillock of silk consisting of\r\nnumerous loosely interwoven threads; it then bends its body so as to\r\ninsinuate the anal pair of prolegs amongst these threads, in which,\r\nby a slight exertion, the little crochets which surround them[494]\r\nbecome so strongly entangled as to support its weight with ease. It\r\nnow suffers the anterior part of the body to fall down, and it hangs\r\nperpendicularly from its silken support with its head downwards. In\r\nthis position it remains often for twenty-four hours, at intervals\r\nalternately contracting and dilating itself. At length the skin is\r\nseen to split on the back near the head, and a portion of the pupa\r\nappears, which by repeated swellings acts like a wedge, and rapidly\r\nextends the slit towards the tail. By the continuance of these\r\nalternate contractions and dilatations of the conical pupa, the skin\r\nof the caterpillar is at last collected in folds near the tail, like\r\na stocking which we roll upon the ancle before withdrawing it from\r\nthe foot. But now comes the important operation. The pupa, being much\r\nshorter than the caterpillar, is as yet at some distance from the\r\nsilken hillock on which it is to be fastened; it is supported merely\r\nby the unsplit terminal portion of the latter's skin. How shall it\r\ndisengage itself from this remnant of its case, and be suspended in\r\nthe air while it climbs up to take its place? Without arms or legs\r\nto support itself, the anxious spectator expects to see it fall to\r\nthe earth. His fears, however, are vain; the supple segments of the\r\npupa's abdomen serve in the place of arms. Between two of these,\r\nas with a pair of pincers, it seizes on a portion of the skin; and\r\nbending its body once more, entirely extricates its tail from it.\r\nIt is now wholly out of the skin, against one side of which it is\r\nsupported, but yet at some distance from the leaf. The next step it\r\nmust take is to climb up to the required height. For this purpose\r\nit repeats the same ingenious manœuvre, making its cast-off skin\r\nserve as a sort of ladder, it successively with different segments\r\nseizes a higher and a higher portion, until in the end it reaches the\r\nsummit, where with its tail it feels for the silken threads that are\r\nto support it. But how can the tail be fastened to them? you ask.\r\nThis difficulty has been provided against by Creative Wisdom. The\r\ntail of the pupa is furnished with numerous little hooks pointing in\r\ndifferent directions[495], as well adapted to the end in view as the\r\ncrochets of the larva's prolegs, and some of these hooks are sure to\r\nfasten themselves upon the silk the moment the tail is thrust amongst\r\nit. Our pupa has now nearly completed its labours; it has withdrawn\r\nits tail from the slough, climbed up it, and suspended itself to the\r\nsilken hillock--manœuvres so delicate and perilous, that we cannot\r\nbut admire that an insect which executes them but once in its life,\r\nshould execute them so well: nor could it, as Reaumur has well and\r\npiously observed, had it not been instructed by a GREAT MASTER. One\r\nmore exertion remains: it seems to have as great an antipathy to\r\nits cast-off skin, as one of us should, when newly clothed after\r\na long imprisonment, to the filthy prison garments we had put off.\r\nIt will not suffer this memento of its former state to remain near\r\nit, and is no sooner suspended in security than it endeavours to\r\nmake it fall. For this end--it seizes, as it were with its tail, the\r\nthreads to which the skin is fastened, and then very rapidly whirls\r\nitself round, often not fewer than twenty times. By this manœuvre\r\nit generally succeeds in breaking them, and the skin falls down.\r\nSometimes, however, the first attempt fails: in that case, after a\r\nmoment's rest, it makes a second, twirling itself in an opposite\r\ndirection; and this is rarely unsuccessful. Yet now and then it is\r\nforced to repeat its whirling, not less than four or five times:\r\nand Reaumur has seen instances where the feet of the skin were so\r\nfirmly hooked, that after many fruitless efforts the pupa, as if in\r\ndespair, gave up the task and suffered it to remain[496]. After these\r\nexertions, it hangs the remainder of its existence in this state\r\nuntil the butterfly is disclosed.\r\n\r\nWe are now to consider the _second_ mode of suspension, in which\r\nlarvæ by means of a silken girth round their middle, fix themselves\r\n_horizontally_ under leaves, &c. These follow the same process with\r\nthat of those last described, in spinning a small hillock of silk to\r\nwhich they fasten their hind legs; and if the operation concerned\r\nthe larva state alone, this would be sufficient, as by means of this\r\nsupport, and of their prolegs, they could easily retain themselves\r\nin a horizontal position. But these larvæ act as if they foresaw\r\nthe assumption of a state in which they will be deprived of legs.\r\nIt is the suspension of the forthcoming pupa that is the object\r\nin view; and though this can be hung by the tail in the same way\r\nwith those of the first class, yet it is plain that it cannot be\r\nretained in a horizontal position, which for some unknown reason is\r\nessential to it, without some support to its anterior extremity. It\r\nis necessary for the larva, therefore, not only to fix its posterior\r\nlegs amongst a collection of silken fibres, but to spin a _girth_\r\nof the same material round its body. This girth, though apparently\r\nof a single thread, will be found on examination to be composed of\r\nseveral, often as many as fifty or sixty; and is fastened on each\r\nside of the body of the larva about the middle, to the surface under\r\nwhich it is placed. Three different modes of fixing these girths\r\nare adopted by the caterpillars of different butterflies. Some, as\r\nthose of the common cabbage-butterfly (_Pieris Brassicæ_), which have\r\nremarkably pliable bodies, bend them almost double on one side, then\r\nfix the thread and carry it over to the other in the same position,\r\nrepeating this operation as often as is necessary. Others, as that\r\nof _Lycæna Argus_ and many more of the _Papiliones Rurales_ and\r\n_Urbicolæ_ L., which have a short and more rigid body, after having\r\nbent the head on one side so as to fix one end of the thread, bring\r\nthemselves into a straight position, and, by a manœuvre not easily\r\ndescribed, contrive to introduce the head under the thread, which\r\nthey then bend themselves to fasten on the other side, pushing it\r\nto its proper situation by the successive tension and contraction\r\nof their segments. But the most curious mode, though indeed that\r\nwhich seems most natural, is adopted by the caterpillar of the\r\nbeautiful swallow-tail butterfly (_Papilio Machaon_) and others of\r\nthe same family. This first forms the loop which is to serve for\r\nits girth, and then creeps under it. But the difficulty it has to\r\nsurmount is, to keep itself from being entangled in the fifty or\r\nsixty fine distinct threads of which the girth is composed, and to\r\npreserve them all extended so as to be able to introduce its body\r\nbeneath them. For this purpose it makes use of the two first pair of\r\nits fore-legs, employing them as a woman does her hands in winding\r\na skein of cotton, to collect and keep all the threads of its card\r\nunentangled and properly stretched; and it is often with great\r\ndifficulty, towards the end of the process, that it prevents them\r\nfrom slipping off. When a sufficient number of threads is completed,\r\nthe animal bends its head between its legs, and insinuates it under\r\nthe collected loop, which by its annular contraction it easily pushes\r\nto the middle of the body.\r\n\r\nIn about thirty hours after the larvæ which girth themselves have\r\nfinished their operations, the skin splits, and the pupa disengages\r\nitself from it by those contractions and dilatations of its segments\r\nwhich have been before described, pushing the exuviæ in folds to\r\nthe tail, by different motions of which it generally succeeds in\r\ndetaching them. One would have thought there would be considerable\r\ndifficulty in slipping the skin past the girth; but this, according\r\nto Reaumur, seems to be easily effected[497].\r\n\r\nIf you are desirous of witnessing for yourself the manœuvres by\r\nwhich these curious modes of suspension are effected, you may be\r\nreadily gratified. It is only necessary to collect and feed until\r\ntheir metamorphosis the black spinous caterpillars of the common\r\npeacock-butterfly (_Vanessa Io_), which in most places may be found\r\nupon nettles, or those of the _Pieris Brassicæ_, which swarm in\r\ncabbages or brocoli in every garden. The former will exhibit to you\r\na specimen of _vertical_, the latter of _horizontal_ suspension. It\r\nshould be observed, however, that to hit the precise moment when\r\nthese processes are going on, it is necessary to feed a considerable\r\nnumber of the larvæ of each kind; some one of which, if you watch\r\nthem narrowly when they have attained their full growth, you will\r\nscarcely fail to surprise in the act.\r\n\r\nI must observe here, that although the vertical and horizontal are\r\nthe two principal positions in which caterpillars suspend themselves,\r\nyet that others are inclined at various angles; and some are attached\r\nwith less art, appearing only to be fastened by some part of their\r\nabdomen to the body upon which they are fixed[498].\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The larvæ whose procedures I am in the next place to describe,\r\nare those which, previously to assuming the pupa state, inclose\r\nthemselves in _cases_ or _cocoons_ of different materials. For the\r\nsake of method, I shall divide these into two great classes: _First_,\r\nthose which form their cocoons entirely or principally of _silk_; and\r\n_secondly_, those which form them chiefly of _other substances_.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the _first_. The larvæ which inclose themselves in\r\n_silken_ cocoons are chiefly of the Lepidopterous tribes of _Bombycidæ_\r\nand _Noctuidæ_; but a few _Geometræ_ (_G. papilioniaria_, _lactearia_,\r\n&c.); most of the _Hymenoptera_; some _Coleoptera_, as certain of the\r\nweevil tribe (_Hypera Arator_, _Rumicis_ Germ.), and those brilliant\r\nbeetles frequenting aquatic plants constituting the genus _Donacia_ F.;\r\nthe Neuropterous genera _Hemerobius_ and _Myrmeleon_; _Mycetophila_\r\nand a few others in the _Diptera_; and _Pulex_ in the _Aphaniptera_\r\nfabricate coverings of the same material. In all, with the exception\r\nof _Myrmeleon_ and _Hemerobius_ (and perhaps _Hypera Rumicis_, &c.?)\r\nwhich have their spinning apparatus at the extremity of the abdomen,\r\nthe silken thread employed in forming these coverings proceeds from\r\nthe middle part of the under-lip, as before explained; and is in fact\r\ncomposed of two threads gummed together as they issue from the two\r\nadjoining orifices of the spinner.\r\n\r\nOf the larvæ which inclose themselves in _silk_, the most familiarly\r\nknown is the silk-worm: the cocoon of this consists exteriorly of a\r\nthin, transparent, gauze-like coating, through the interstices of\r\nwhich can be seen an inner, smaller, oval ball of a more close and\r\ncompact texture. The whole is in fact composed of one single thread,\r\nbut arranged in two distinct modes. To form the _exterior_ envelope,\r\nwhich is merely the scaffolding by means of which the inner and\r\nmore solid covering is constructed, the caterpillar, after fixing\r\nupon a space between two leaves or twigs or angles suitable for\r\nits purpose, begins by glueing one end of its thread to one of the\r\nadjoining surfaces. This thread it next conducts to another part and\r\nthen fastens, repeating this process and interlacing it in various\r\ndirections, until it has surrounded itself with a slight and loosely\r\nspun netting. In the centre of this, when contracted into a space\r\nsufficiently small, it lays the foundation of the _interior_ cocoon.\r\nFixing itself by its prolegs to some of the surrounding threads, it\r\nbends its body, and by successive motions of its head from side to\r\nside spins a layer of silk on the side opposite to it: when this\r\nis of the requisite thickness, the larva shifts its position, and\r\nrepeats the same process in another quarter, covering each layer\r\nin turn with a new one until the interior cavity is reduced to the\r\nsize desired. Thus, the silken thread which forms this new cocoon is\r\nnot, as might have been supposed, wound circularly as we wind the\r\nthread of a ball of cotton; but backwards and forwards in a series\r\nof zigzags, so as to compose a number of distinct layers. Malpighi\r\ncould distinguish six of these layers[499], and Reaumur suspects\r\nthere is often a greater number[500]. The former found the length of\r\nthe thread of silk composing them when wound off, without including\r\nthe exterior case, to be not less than 930 feet[501]; but others have\r\ncomputed it at more than a thousand[502]: consequently the threads\r\nof five cocoons united would be a mile in length. Estimating by the\r\nweight,--the thread of a pound of cocoons, each of which weighs about\r\ntwo grains and a half, would extend more than 600 miles[503], and\r\nsuch is its tenuity, that the threads of five or six cocoons require\r\nto be joined to form one of the thickness requisite in the silk\r\nmanufacture. It is the continuous thread of the inner cocoon which is\r\nmost valuable; the outer loose coating from its irregularity cannot\r\nbe wound off, and is known in commerce by the name of _floss silk_.\r\n\r\nManœuvres in their general principle similar to those of the\r\nsilk-worm are followed by most of those larvæ which inclose\r\nthemselves in silken cocoons. Many species, however, adopt variations\r\nin the mode of procedure all of which it would be tedious to\r\nparticularize, but some of them are worth mentioning. The larvæ of\r\n_Tortrix prasinana_, and other species of moths which form cocoons\r\nresembling a reversed boat, arrange their threads in layers, so as to\r\nconstruct two parallel walls gradually inclining towards the top and\r\nends, where they finally force them to approach each other by means\r\nof an apparatus of silken cables[504]. And the larva of _Saturnia\r\nPavonia_, though it forms the base of its flask-shaped cocoon by\r\nspinning like the silk-worm a number of interwoven zigzags, places\r\nthe threads which compose the interior funnel-like opening of the\r\napex nearly straight, parallel to each other, and converging towards\r\nthe same point in the centre[505].\r\n\r\nThese last, as well as almost all larvæ, constantly remain in the\r\n_inside_ of the cocoon during its construction. But De Geer has given\r\nus the history of a minute caterpillar of a species of moth (_Tinea_\r\nL.) which feeds on the under side of the leaves of the _Rhamnus\r\nFrangula_, or Black Alder, that actually weaves half of its cocoon\r\non the _outside_. This cocoon, which is very small, is beautifully\r\nfluted, consisting of several longitudinal cords, with the intervals\r\nfilled by fine net-work, and shaped like a reversed boat[506]. The\r\nanimal begins by laying the foundations of one of the ends of\r\nher cocoon, she adds new threads to this small beginning, and so\r\nproceeds. As the work advances she retreats backwards, and her body\r\nis situated nearly in the same line with the cocoon she has begun,\r\nand quite _out_ of it; she only touches with her head and legs its\r\nanterior margin. When half the cocoon, or rather of its exterior\r\nlayer, is finished, she suspends her operations for some moments. She\r\nthen for the first time introduces her head _into_ this demi-cocoon,\r\nand turns herself in it by doubling her supple body, and passing\r\none part over the other, so that at last she manages to bring her\r\ntail into the pointed end of the cocoon, the head and the anterior\r\nhalf of her body remaining without. Thus situated, she commences her\r\noperations afresh. At a distance from the margin of the demi-cocoon,\r\nequal to its length, she begins to spin the pointed end of the other\r\nmoiety, the length of her body serving her as a measure that enables\r\nher to begin at the proper distance from it. This new portion she\r\nspins in the same manner as the other; but as she is prevented by the\r\ndemi-cocoon in which the posterior part of her body is lodged from\r\nretreating backwards, she contracts her body more, which answers the\r\nsame purpose. When the new work is so advanced that she can no longer\r\ncontract her body, she bends the anterior part of it considerably,\r\nand reverses her head. When the distance between the margin of the\r\ntwo halves of the cocoon is very small, so as no longer to admit the\r\nhead between them, in order to unite them she is obliged to have\r\nrecourse to another manœuvre. Withdrawing her head, she extends\r\nsilken longitudinal threads between the two margins, and thus unites\r\nthem. This part is more clumsy, and not so regular as the rest\r\nof the cocoon, so that the point of union is always discoverable.\r\nThese caterpillars do not always divide the cocoon into two _equal_\r\nportions, for often they will finish three quarters of the cocoon\r\nbefore they enter it, and begin at the other end[507].\r\n\r\nThe general rule is,--that each larva spins for itself a separate\r\ncocoon; but amongst those of _Arctia chrysorhea_ and others which\r\nlive in society, two or three sometimes begin their operations so\r\nclose together that they are under the necessity of forming one\r\ncommon cocoon, which serves for a covering to the whole number.\r\nThe same thing happens to silk-worms, the double or treble cocoons\r\nof which are called _Dupions_ by the breeders. The larvæ of some\r\nIchneumons, besides forming each its separate cocoon, spin a joint\r\ncottony covering for the whole[508], which is effected thus:--After\r\nthey leave the caterpillar they have devoured, they fix themselves\r\nside by side at a little distance from it, and begin to spin each a\r\ncocoon; and in order to defend its end and side that is not covered\r\nby others, they spin further an envelope of loose silk, and thus this\r\nexterior covering is formed.\r\n\r\nThe size, figure, colour, substance, and texture of silken cocoons\r\nare extremely various. Their _size_ indeed is usually proportioned\r\nto that of the included larva or pupa; yet it is by no means always\r\nso. Some large caterpillars spin cocoons so small, that the observer\r\ncan hardly conceive how they can be contained in so narrow a compass:\r\n_Eriogaster Catax_ is a moth of this description[509]. And others\r\nsmaller in size lodge themselves in apartments apparently much\r\nmore spacious than necessary. The transparent hammock-like cocoons\r\nof _Hepialus Humuli_ and _Arctia villica_, two other moths, would\r\ncontain several of their pupæ. I possess one in which the pupa is\r\nsuspended in the centre, that is ten times its size, and not very\r\nshort in dimensions of that of _Attacus Paphia_, a giant silk-moth.\r\nThe largest cocoon I ever read or heard of, is that thus described by\r\nMr. Hobhouse in his _Travels_: \"Depending,\" says he, \"from the boughs\r\nof the pines, near the Attic mountain Parnes, and stretching across\r\nfrom tree to tree so as to obstruct our passage, were the pods,\r\n_thrice as big as a turkey's egg!_ and the thick webs of a chrysalis,\r\nwhose moth must be far larger than any of those in our country.\"[510]\r\nIf this statement is correct, and I am not aware that there is any\r\nreason for doubting it, the cocoon must be vastly larger than the\r\npupa, or the moth it produced would far exceed in size any yet known.\r\nPerhaps, however, as this gentleman is probably no entomologist,\r\nwhat he took for a cocoon might be a nidus, in which many larvæ were\r\nassociated, of the nature of those formerly described[511].\r\n\r\nWith regard to _figure_, the majority are like those of the\r\nsilk-worm, of a shape more or less oval or elliptic: some, however,\r\nvary from this. That of _Lasiocampa Rubi_ is oblong. I have one from\r\nNew Holland somewhat resembling an acorn, fixed to the twigs of\r\nsome tree or shrub, of a very close silk, and covered by a circular\r\noperculum, which the animal pushes off when it assumes the imago;\r\nthis is ovate or conico-ovate; others again are globose[512]; others\r\nare conical[513], as that of _Gastropacha quercifolia_; others\r\nalmost fusiform[514] (_Odenesis potatoria_). Reaumur received\r\none from Arabia which was nearly cylindrical[515]. Those of _T.\r\nprasinana_ before noticed, and many other _Tortrices_, are shaped\r\nlike a reversed boat[516]; that of _Saturnia Pavonia_ and others of\r\nthe same tribe, like a Florence flask with a wide and short neck. The\r\ncocoon of _Lygæna Filipendulæ_ resembles a grain of barley. Another\r\ncocoon in my cabinet, of very slight network, is shaped something\r\nlike an air-balloon. But the most remarkable one for its form and\r\ncharacters, is one that I received from the rich cabinet above\r\nquoted. This, which is of an unusually close texture, is suspended by\r\na thread more than two inches long from the point of a leaf; it then\r\nswells into a perfect cone, at the base about four-fifths of an inch\r\nin diameter and half an inch in length, and covered with scattered\r\nsetiform appendages: from the centre of the base projects a large\r\nhemispherical protuberance, which terminates in a long stalk, much\r\nthicker than the thread that suspends the cocoon. There is commonly\r\nno difference between the shape of cocoons spun by larvæ which are\r\nto give birth to different sexes of the same species. The silk-worm\r\ncocoons, however, which will produce _male_ moths, have more silk at\r\nthe ends, and consequently are more round than those which are to\r\nproduce _females_: but the difference is not striking.\r\n\r\nThe most usual _colour_ of silken cocoons is white, yellow, or brown,\r\nor the intermediate shades. The whites are very pure in the general\r\nenvelope of some species of _Ichneumonidæ_, and yellows often very\r\nbrilliant. But besides these more general colours, some cocoons are\r\nblack[517], some few blue or green, and others red[518]. Sometimes\r\nthe same cocoon is of two different colours. Those of certain\r\nparasites of the tribe of _Ichneumones minuti_ L. the motions of one\r\nof which I noticed on a former occasion[519], are alternately banded\r\nwith black or brown and white, or have only a pale or white belt in\r\nthe middle, which gives them a singular appearance. In both cases\r\nthe difference in colour depends upon the different tints with which\r\nthe silky gum is imbued in the reservoirs: the first portion of it\r\nis white, and with this the larva first sketches the outline of its\r\ncocoon, and then thickens the layers of silk considerably in those\r\nparts where the white bands appear: when these are finished, its\r\nstock of white silk is exhausted, and the remainder of the interior\r\nof the cocoon is composed of brown silk[520]. The circular operculum\r\nabove mentioned as covering an acorn-shaped cocoon, is paler than\r\nthe latter, and also ornamented by a zone within the margin of deep\r\nbrown. The pale cocoon also of _Attacus Paphia_ is veined with silk\r\nof a deep red.\r\n\r\nI have very little to say on the _substance_ of the silk of cocoons.\r\nThough that of the silk-worm is composed of such a slender thread, that\r\nof many others is still finer, scarcely yielding in tenuity to the\r\nspider's web. On the other hand, the silk of the cocoons of _Saturnia\r\nPavonia_ and of several foreign species is as thick as a hair.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _texture_ of their cocoons--in some, as in that\r\nof the silk-worm, the threads are so slightly glued to each other,\r\nas to separate with facility; but in that of the emperor-moth just\r\nmentioned they are intimately connected by a gummy matter, furnished,\r\nas Reaumur conjectures, from the anus[521], with which the whole\r\ninterior of the cocoon is often plastered. Some, as that of the\r\nsilk-worm, are composed of an exterior loose envelope, and an inner\r\ncompact ball; others have no exterior covering, the whole cocoon\r\nbeing of an uniform and thick texture. The larva of _Cossus Robiniæ_\r\nPeck, in spinning its cocoon, makes the end next the opening to the\r\nair, by which the imago is to emerge, of a slighter texture than\r\nthe rest of it[522]. The exterior case is sometimes, as in _Laria\r\npudibunda_, very closely woven, so as to resemble a real cocoon[523]:\r\nits form is usually adapted to that of the inner one; but in some\r\nwhich fix them under flat surfaces (_Laria fascelina_, _Callimorpha\r\nCaja_,) it resembles a hammock[524]. Cocoons of a close texture have\r\ngenerally no orifice in any part; but that of _Eriogaster lanestris_\r\nis spun with openings, as if bored from without, the use of which,\r\nhowever, does not seem to have been ascertained[525].\r\n\r\nMany silken cocoons are of so close a fabric, as, when finished,\r\nentirely to conceal the included insect; but a very considerable number\r\nare of a more open texture, composed of a much smaller quantity of\r\nsilk, and that woven so loosely, that the larva or pupa may always\r\nbe discovered through it. Of this description are the cocoons of\r\n_Hypogymna dispar_, _Arctia Salicis_, &c., which consist only of a few\r\nslight meshes. Those of some others resemble gauze or lace[526]. Of\r\nthe first description is one in my cabinet before alluded to, shaped\r\nsomewhat like an air-balloon; the meshes are large and perfectly\r\nsquare. The pupa hangs in the centre, fixed by some few slight threads\r\nwhich diverge from it to all parts of the cocoon--so that it looks as\r\nif it was suspended in the air, like Mahomet's coffin, without support.\r\nOf the second description is a black one with very fine and nearly\r\ncircular meshes: the threads that form these are thick, and seem to be\r\nagglutinated. In our own country, the cocoons of some beetles, as of\r\n_Hypera Arator_, _Galeruca Tanaceti_, and of some little _Tineæ_, also\r\nresemble gauze. Many of the larvæ, however, which spin these cocoons,\r\nwhose thinness is probably attributable to the smallness of their stock\r\nof silk, seem anxious for a more complete concealment; and therefore\r\ncommonly either hide them between leaves tied together, in some with\r\na certain regularity, in others without art[527]; or thicken their\r\ntexture, and render it opaque, by the addition of grains of earth[528],\r\nor of other materials with which their bodies supply them. These are\r\nprincipally of two kinds. The larvæ of _Lasiocampa Neustria_, _Arctia\r\nSalicis_, &c. after spinning their cocoons, cast from their anus three\r\nor four masses of a soft and paste-like matter, which they apply with\r\ntheir head all round the inside of the cavity; and which, drying in a\r\nshort time, becomes a powder that effectually renders it opake. This\r\nis not, as might be conjectured, an excrement, but a true secretion,\r\nevidently intended for this very purpose: and, according to Reaumur,\r\na similar powder, but white, derived from the varicose intestines, is\r\nused by the caterpillars of _Gastropacha quercifolia_, &c.[529] The\r\nother material, which is still more frequently employed, and which is\r\noccasionally mixed with the former, is the _hair_ which everyone has\r\nobserved to cover so thickly the bodies of some caterpillars. This,\r\nafter spinning a sufficient envelope, they tear, or in some instances\r\ncut off with their mandibles, and distribute all round them, pushing\r\nit with their head amongst the interstices of the silk, so as to make\r\nthe whole of a regular thick texture. After this process, which leaves\r\nthe body completely denuded, and often seems to give them great pain,\r\nthey conclude by spinning another tissue of slight silk, in order to\r\nprotect the forthcoming pupa from the surrounding prickly points. It\r\nshould be observed, however, that though many hairy larvæ, as those\r\nof _Noctua Aceris_, _Arctia Caja_, and others, employ their hairs in\r\nthe composition of their cocoons, the rule is not general, several\r\nnever making any such use of them. Nor do all that do so employ them\r\ndistribute them in the same manner as those above described, which\r\nrarely attempt to arrange them in any regular position. Reaumur has\r\nnoticed a small hairy caterpillar that feeds on lichens, which is more\r\nmethodical: this actually places its hairs upright, side by side, as\r\nregularly as the pales in a palisade, in an oval ring around its body,\r\nconnecting them by a slight tissue of silk, which forces them to bend\r\ninto a sort of roof at the top; and under this curiously-formed cocoon\r\nassumes its state of pupa[530]. Some larvæ make so much hair and so\r\nlittle silk enter into the composition of their cocoons, that on the\r\nfirst inspection they would be pronounced wholly composed of it[531];\r\nothers, thickening the interior of their cocoon with hair, line the\r\nwhole with a viscid matter like varnish[532].\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of some saw-flies (_Tenthredo_ L.) are remarkable for\r\ninclosing themselves in a double cocoon, in which the inner is not,\r\nas in the silk-worm &c., connected with the outer, but perfectly\r\ndistinct from it. Some species, as _T. Rosæ_ (_Cryptus_ Jur.), which\r\nhave but a small stock of silk, compose the outer cocoon of thick\r\nsilken cords crossing at right angles, and forming an oval net;\r\nwhich at the same time that it protects them effectually from the\r\nants, which are always ready to attack them, demands much less silk\r\nthan a covering of a closer texture. But the tender nymph itself\r\nrequires to be inclosed in a case of a softer and more delicate\r\nsubstance; and accordingly the inner cocoon is composed of fine silk,\r\nwoven so closely that the threads are scarcely perceptible under a\r\nmicroscope[533]. Reaumur mentions a hymenopterous larva belonging\r\nto Latreille's _Fossores_ (_Sphex_ L.) which thickened its cocoon\r\nwith the legs, wings, and other relics of the flies which it had\r\ndevoured[534]: trophies--like the drinking-cups of some savages, made\r\nof the skulls of their enemies, or the skull pyramid near Ispahan--of\r\nits powers of devastation.\r\n\r\nIt is a general rule, that those larvæ which spin cocoons, never\r\nin ordinary circumstances become pupæ without having thus inclosed\r\nthemselves. An exception, however, is met with in the larva of\r\na species of ant noticed by De Geer (_Formica fusca_ L.), some\r\nof the individuals of which inclose themselves in cocoons; while\r\nothers neglect this precaution, and undergo their metamorphosis\r\nuncovered[535]. Rösel also made nearly the same observation on the\r\nlarva of the flea[536].\r\n\r\nI must say something with regard to the _situation_, often very\r\nremote from their place of feeding, in which larvæ fabricate their\r\ncocoons. A very considerable number, probably the majority, form\r\nthem either partially (_Arctia lubricipeda_) or wholly under ground;\r\nothers beneath dead leaves, moss, or in the chinks of the trees;\r\nothers within the wood in substances on which they have fed; the\r\nlarva of _Cossus_ leaves in these a communication with the open air\r\nby which the imago emerges; and a large number attach them to the\r\nleaves and branches of trees and plants; the cocoon of _Donacia\r\nfasciata_(?) is fastened by one side to the roots or surculi of\r\n_Typha latifolia_. There is usually nothing very remarkable in\r\nthe mode of fixing them, the exterior threads being merely gummed\r\nirregularly to different portions of the objects which support them.\r\nBut some effect this with greater art. I have one from New Holland,\r\nvery long, which is suspended from a twig by a long riband, as it\r\nwere, which entirely girths the twig. The larva of the magnificent\r\nsilk-moth, _Attacus Paphia_, actually forms a solid silken stalk\r\nto its cocoon, an inch and half in length and a line in diameter,\r\nfastened by the other extremity to a twig, which it closely surrounds\r\nas if with a ring, at first sight resembling a fruit of a very\r\nsingular appearance[537]. I have specimens of this cocoon with both\r\nstalk and ring. A bell-shaped cocoon fastened by a foot-stalk, but\r\nof softer consistence, to a blade of grass, found by Mr. Sheppard, I\r\ncan also show you; and my friend Mr. Wilkin had a similar one out of\r\nthe late Mr. Hudson's collection. Most larvæ spin their cocoons in\r\nsolitude: some of those, however, which live in society do it close\r\ntogether under their common tent.\r\n\r\nThere are other cocoons that should be noticed here, such as those\r\nformed by the larva of _Zygæna Filipendulæ_, and some _Bombyces_,\r\nsaw-flies (_Tenthredo_ L.), and beetles (_Curculio_, _Donacia_ F.),\r\n&c. These are formed of a substance which seems more analogous to gum\r\nthan silk, yet furnished from the silk reservoirs, and usually present\r\nthe appearance externally of parchment or membrane. That of the insect\r\nfirst mentioned is coated, however, with a slight interior silken\r\nlining; as indeed are almost all cocoons, of whatever substance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _second_ class, into which I have divided larvæ that inclose\r\nthemselves in cocoons, includes those which form their coverings\r\nnot solely or principally of silk, but in which other materials are\r\nmixed more or less. The cocoons of some of these larvæ are merely\r\ncomposed of a few leaves slightly tied together, either irregularly,\r\nor arranged, particularly when they are of a linear figure, with\r\nconsiderable symmetry. The grubs of many beetles, as of the\r\nrose-beetle, _Cetonia aurata_, &c., prepare themselves a cocoon,\r\ncomposed of earth, pieces of rotten wood, and any substances within\r\ntheir reach: which they fasten together with a glutinous secretion.\r\nThe same material is employed by others in forming a cocoon wholly\r\nof earth; which is sometimes, as that of the stag-beetle, _Lucanus\r\nCervus_, exceedingly hard; at others, as that of some moths, _Noctua\r\nambigua_, &c, so slight as to fall to pieces as soon as touched[538].\r\nOther cocoons are formed of grains of earth. Reaumur has given a\r\nvery interesting account of the procedures of a larva in repairing\r\none of these cocoons, from which he had broken off the top when just\r\ncompleted. Without quitting the interior of the walls that remained,\r\nit put out its head from the breach, and for more than an hour\r\nemployed itself in selecting one by one grains of earth, which it\r\nconveyed with its mandibles and deposited within its case: it next\r\nspun all round the opening threads of silk, to which it attached\r\ngrains of earth taken from the previously-stored heap, uniting them\r\ncompactly by means of other silken threads. After employing three\r\nhours in this laborious process, the industrious little mason had\r\nreduced the diameter of the breach to a few lines. Reaumur was very\r\ncurious to know how it would fill up this orifice, which would no\r\nlonger admit the protrusion of its head outside the walls, as in\r\nits previous operations. He concluded, that while the rest of the\r\ncocoon was exteriorly formed of earth, this opening would be merely\r\nclosed with silk. He was mistaken, however: the artist knew how to\r\nvary its manœuvres, and make its vault of one uniform texture. It\r\nspun across the opening a little net of silk, between the meshes of\r\nwhich it thrust grains of earth so dexterously that they projected\r\nas far as the outer surface, retained there probably by silken\r\nlines previously attached and fastened within. It then finished its\r\nhabitation by fortifying the inside of the orifice with another layer\r\nof earth[539]. The ant-lion (_Myrmeleon_) spins a globular cocoon\r\nwith its anus, which it covers with grains of sand[540]. One that I\r\ntook in the forest of Fontainebleau, in the quarry that produces the\r\ncrystallized sandstone called the _Fontainebleau fossil_, was covered\r\nwith large and shining grains. Instead of the grains of earth or sand\r\nemployed by these larvæ, those of another tribe substitute grains\r\nof stone detached from the softer walls, upon whose lichens they\r\npreviously feed, which they unite into solid oval cocoons[541]. Those\r\nof a fourth form their cocoons of patches of short moss arranged with\r\nthe roots downwards, and forming a vault, as it were, of verdant\r\nturf, admirably adapted for concealment[542]. The larvæ of some moths\r\nform their cocoons of irregular pieces of bark tied together with\r\nsilk, and resembling when completed a knotty protuberance of the twig\r\non which they are fixed. That of _Pyralis tuberculana_ constructs a\r\npannier-shaped one of the parenchyma of the leaves of plants[543].\r\n\r\nAll these cocoons, however, must yield in point of singularity of\r\nconstruction, materials, and ingenuity, to one formed by a small\r\ncaterpillar, described by the illustrious naturalist lately quoted,\r\nwhich feeds upon the oak. This cocoon is wholly composed of small\r\nrectangular strap-shaped pieces of the fine upper skin, or epidermis\r\nof the twig upon which it rests, regularly fastened to each other\r\nin a longitudinal direction with very slender silken cords. But the\r\nmode of its construction is even more remarkable than the substance\r\nof which it is fabricated. The caterpillar's first process is to\r\nform its slips of bark into two flat triangular wing-like pieces,\r\nprojecting opposite to each other from each side of the twig,\r\nsomewhat like the feathers of an arrow. It does not, perhaps, require\r\nany great degree of intelligence in a larva to give its cocoon the\r\nusual oval form, when it begins to arrange its materials in that\r\nshape from the very first, and round so good a mould as its own bent\r\nbody; but we surely must admit that it is a task to which no stupid\r\nartist would be competent, to form first a multitude of strap-shaped\r\nlaminæ into two triangular plates, and then to bend these plates\r\ninto a case resembling the longitudinal section of a cone, with an\r\nelliptical and protuberant base,--the figure which the cocoon of this\r\ninsect assumes. All the minutiæ of the manœuvres which it employs in\r\nthis nice operation could not be comprehended without a more diffuse\r\nexplanation than I have here room to give: suffice it to say, that\r\nthe caterpillar fastens silken lines to each exterior opposite and\r\nlonger side of the laminæ, and by applying all the weight of its\r\nbody forces them to bend and approach each other, in which position\r\nit secures them by other shorter lines. It next repeats the same\r\nprocess with the upper and shorter sides of the plates; which when\r\njoined form the base of the cocoon. Both these tasks are accomplished\r\nin less than an hour, and the seams are so nicely joined as to be\r\nimperceptible. A fine inner tapestry of silk, covering all the\r\nasperities of the exterior walls, concludes its labours[544]. It\r\nis to be lamented that Reaumur was unacquainted with the moth that\r\nproceeds from the pupæ inclosed in these ingenious cocoons; which\r\nbeing small, and precisely of the same colour as the bark of the\r\ntwig that supports them, are not to be discovered but by a very\r\nnarrow inspection. It would seem, however, to be _Noctua Strigula_\r\nof Berkhausen, _Pyralis strigulalis_ of Hubner[545]. The larva, he\r\ninforms us, is found in May: its body is flatter than common, of\r\na yellowish flesh-colour, clothed with tufts of red hair on each\r\nsegment, and furnished with fourteen feet. Should this description\r\nenable you to detect it upon your oaks, a view of its ingenious\r\nprocedures would amply repay you for the trouble of seeking for it.\r\nThe larvæ of _Cerura vinula_, _Stauropus Fagi_, and several other\r\nmoths, form their cocoons of grains of wood gnawed from the trees on\r\nwhich they feed. These grains they masticate, mixed with a glutinous\r\nfluid secreted from the mouth, into a paste, which forms a covering\r\nof an uniform smooth texture, and so hard as not readily to yield\r\nto a knife. Of a substance apparently nearly similar is composed\r\nthe cocoon of a weevil related to _Liparus Pini_; which with its\r\ninhabitant was given me by the ingenious Mr. Bullock. A little moth,\r\nwhose ravages have been before noticed[546], lines the interior of\r\nthe grain of barley, of which it has devoured the contents, with\r\nsilk; divides it into two apartments, into one of which it pushes the\r\nexcrement it had voided, and in the other assumes the pupa[547].\r\n\r\nThese, and the other larvæ mentioned above, commonly form their\r\ncocoons of the substances I have indicated; but when by any cause\r\nthey are prevented from access to them, they often substitute such\r\nother materials as are at hand. Reaumur fed a larva that formed its\r\ncocoon of minute fragments of paper, which with its mandibles it\r\nhad cut from the piece that covered the glass vessel that contained\r\nit[548]: and the same circumstance happened to Bonnet.\r\n\r\nUpon a former occasion I described to you the cases of various kinds\r\nformed and inhabited by the insects of the _Trichoptera_ Order\r\n(_Phryganea_ L.) commonly called case-worms[549]. As these serve\r\nfor the pupa as well as the larva, they may be regarded as a kind\r\nof cocoon. I shall not repeat here what I then said; but having\r\npurchased from the collection of the late Mr. Francillon some that\r\nseem to belong to this or some cognate tribe, that are of a curious\r\nconstruction, I shall give you some account of two or three of\r\nthem in this place. The first is not quite three inches long, of a\r\nsublanceolate shape, but rather widest towards one end. It consists\r\nof an internal tough and thick bag or cocoon, of a silk resembling\r\nfine wool of a dirty white colour, which is closely covered\r\ntransversely by pieces of the stalk of a plant, about three-fourths\r\nof an inch in length, and crossing each other at an obtuse angle.\r\nThe next is thicker and shorter: the internal bag is just covered\r\nwith small fragments of wood like sawdust; over these are fastened\r\nirregularly, short stout pieces of a pithy stick or stalk, and the\r\nwhole is clothed with a very close-woven ash-coloured web. It seems\r\ndifficult to conceive how the inclosed animal could contrive to\r\ncover her habitation with this web without going wholly out of it.\r\nThe third is the most curious and remarkable of all. It is nearly\r\nsix inches long, and about four-fifths of an inch in diameter. It\r\nconsists of a bag of thick cinereous silk web, to which are fastened,\r\nin a sextuple series, pieces of stick about an inch long, the end of\r\none mostly resting upon the base of another: between each series a\r\nspace of about three-tenths of an inch intervenes, but at the apex\r\nthey all converge. This probably imitates the branch or stem of some\r\ntree or plant, in which the leaves are linear, and diverge but little\r\nfrom the stem. A label upon it states its country to be New Holland.\r\nI suspect the inhabitants of the two last cocoons to be terrestrial\r\nanimals: the first is probably a true aquatic case-worm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe same purpose for which the cocoons above described serve, is\r\nanswered in the case of numerous _Dipterous_ insects, by a humble and\r\nless artificial contrivance--the skin, namely, of the larva; which,\r\nas was before observed[550], is never cast, but, when the insect is\r\nabout to enter into the pupa state, assumes a different form and\r\ncolour; becomes of a thicker and more rigid texture; and defends the\r\nincluded pupa, which is separate from it, till its exclusion. In\r\nthis case the mouth of the larva is constantly different from that\r\nof the perfect insect, or at least has not with it those relations\r\nas to number and kind of organs, which have been observed in the\r\nmouth of other larvæ compared with the insects that they produce.\r\nThe animal, immediately after it is clothed with this skin, if it\r\nis opened, exhibits only a soft gelatinous pulp, in the surface of\r\nwhich the exterior organs of the adult insect cannot yet be detected.\r\nNature requires more time for their elaboration, or at least for\r\nthe appearance of their outline, and to consolidate them. This pulp\r\nfirst takes an oblong form (_Boule allongée_ Reaum.), and afterwards\r\nthat of the insect it is destined to give birth to[551]. The skin of\r\nthe larva also serves for a cocoon to the pupæ of male _Cocci_[552].\r\nThe grub of the genus _Anthrenus_, so destructive to our cabinets\r\nof natural objects[553], when it assumes the pupa does not quit\r\nits skin, but only splits it open longitudinally on the back, and\r\nwhen it becomes an imago makes its exit through the orifice[554].\r\nSome Lepidopterous larvæ even (_Alucita pentadactyla_, _Callimorpha\r\nrosea_, &c.) assume the pupa state within their last skin[555].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen a larva has finished its cocoon,--which with some species, that\r\nproceed so earnestly as though they had not a moment to lose, is the\r\nwork of a few hours, of others about two or three days,--after a\r\ncertain interval it casts its last skin, which is usually suffered to\r\nremain in the cocoon (but which one moth, _Geometra lacertinaria_,\r\nejects through an opening purposely left in its bottom), and the pupa\r\nmakes its appearance[556]. This interval is exceedingly various. Most\r\nlarvæ assume the pupa state within a few days after they have formed\r\ntheir cocoons; but some not for several weeks, or even months. The\r\ncaterpillar of _Bombyx cæruleocephala_, according to Rösel, lies\r\nthree weeks in the cocoon before this change is effected; those of\r\nmany _Pupivora_ and _Diplolepariæ_ Latr., according to Reaumur,\r\nsix months[557]; that of _Phalæna urticata_ nine months[558]; and\r\nthat of _Cimbex lutea_, according to De Geer, sometimes eighteen\r\nmonths[559]. Brahm observes, that such larvæ of the double-brooded\r\nmoth, _Hepialus Testudo_, as form their cocoons in autumn, do not\r\nbecome pupæ until the following spring; while those which form them\r\nin summer undergo this change in a few days[560]. From this fact\r\nit might be conjectured, that the degree of heat prevailing at\r\nthe time the insect incloses itself determines the period of the\r\npupa's appearance; but this supposition seems contradicted by what\r\nReaumur observed of a brood of the larvæ of _Phalæna urticata_, just\r\nmentioned, which, though they formed themselves cocoons in September,\r\ndid not become pupæ till the June following[561]. I am unable,\r\ntherefore, to assign any plausible cause for these extraordinary\r\nvariations. The difficulty of comprehending how animals before so\r\nvoracious can live so long without food may be partly surmounted, by\r\nadverting to the circumstance of its having attained its full growth,\r\nand laid up a store of nutriment for the development of the perfect\r\ninsect. It is consequently no more wonderful that it should not have\r\nneed of any further supply without casting off its upper integument,\r\nthan that it should not eat after having done so and become a pupa.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[206] De Geer vii. 197.\r\n\r\n[207] De Geer vii. 197.\r\n\r\n[208] Ibid. 85.\r\n\r\n[209] _Epist._ lxvii. 1694. 390.\r\n\r\n[210] _Enum.

According to Reaumur, the larva as\r\nwell as the pupa of _Chermes Ficus_ has wing-cases (iii. 353).\r\n\r\n[220] These are in the female sex of some _Coleoptera_, as\r\n_Lampyris_, &c. which retain in the perfect state nearly the same\r\nform which they had when larvæ. The larvæ of some _Staphylini_ are\r\nnot very dissimilar in form to the perfect insect.\r\n\r\n[221] The larvæ described in the first Section, which resemble the\r\nimago, are usually covered with a skin not materially different from\r\nthat of the insect in that state.\r\n\r\n[222] Huber _Fourmis._ 73; _N.

It was a female, which deposited eggs that proved\r\nbarren. If this solitary instance was not a mistake, is it possible\r\nthat some parasitic larva had devoured only the inclosed head of the\r\nbutterfly, or so injured it that it could not reject the hard skin of\r\nthe larva, and yet not be destroyed?\r\n\r\n[225] The only larvæ which have a visible distinct neck are those\r\nof some _Dytisci_, _Staphylini_, and a few others, in which this\r\npart is quite distinct: proving the erroneousness of the opinion of\r\nthose German entomologists, who consider the thorax as analogous to\r\nthe neck of other animals, and hence call it _Halsschild_. In some\r\nlepidopterous larvæ, however, as in that of _Pieris Brassicæ_, though\r\nno visible neck presents itself, one is very perceptible when the\r\ninsect stretches the head forward considerably.

Another\r\nminute caterpillar described by Reaumur has the third pair of the\r\nlegs apparently fleshy and singularly incrassated at the apex into a\r\npyriform figure, terminated by a pair of claws. This conformation is\r\nfor some particular purpose in the economy of the animal, since they\r\nare the most busily employed of all in arranging the threads of her\r\nweb. Reaum. ii. 258. In the larva of a geometer (_Geometra lunaria_)\r\nthe third pair are remarkably long. Illig. _Mag._ 402. In that of\r\nanother moth, according to Kuhn (_Naturf._ xvi. 78. _t._ iv. _f._\r\n3), the third pair of the fore-legs is remarkably incrassated, being\r\ntwice as thick and long as the other pair, though consisting of the\r\nsame number of joints, the last of which has claws.\r\n\r\n[294] On the legs and prolegs see also what is said above, VOL.

An exception is furnished to the rule by the\r\nsingular _limaciform_ ones of _Hepialus Testudo_ and _Asellus_ of\r\nFabricius, two moths forming Haworth's genus _Apoda_, which have no\r\ndistinct prolegs, but in their stead a number of small transparent\r\nshining tubercles without claws. The larva also of one of the\r\nsubcutaneous moths first discovered by De Geer in the leaves of the\r\nrose (i. 446), but whose history is fully given by Goeze, _Naturf._\r\nxv. 37-48, (who has satisfactorily ascertained that it is the true\r\nlarva of a _Tinea_ of Linné, but of a different habit from that of\r\nmost subcutaneous ones), has no true legs, and eighteen prolegs\r\nwithout any claws. Another subcutaneous larva, for the history of\r\nwhich we are indebted to M. Godeheu de Riville, is according to him\r\nentirely deprived of legs of any kind (Bonnet ix. 196--.); as is\r\nanother of the same tribe that feeds on the poplar, an account of\r\nwhich is given by Goeze _Naturf._ xiv. 105.\r\n\r\n[297] PLATE XXIII.

Mr. MacLeay's idea of the\r\nlarva of _Meloe_ is taken from the animal which Frisch, Goedart, and\r\nDe Geer imagined to be such; but upon this opinion there rest great\r\ndoubts. (See Kirby _Mon. Ap. Angl._ ii. 168, and Latreille _N. Dict.\r\nd'Hist. Nat._ xx. 109.) At p. 464 he gives also _Mordella_ and many\r\n_Heteromera_ as having Thysanuriform larvæ. He thinks, that probably\r\nthat of _Clerus_ is of the same description; to which he suspects\r\nthat many of Latreille's _Malacoderma_ likewise belong.\r\n\r\n[380] PLATE XVIII. FIG. 1. as to the thoracic shield.\r\n\r\n[381] _May_ 27, 1822. This day, T. Allen, Esq. F.L.S. brought me in a\r\nphial a vast number of the little insect which Goedart, Frisch, and De\r\nGeer took for the larva of _Meloe Proscarabæus_, which he found on the\r\nleaves of _Achillea Millefolium_. These little animals were coursing\r\neach other with wonderful velocity over the sides of the phial. To\r\nassist them in their motions, they applied to the surface of the glass\r\nthe end of their abdomen, using it, like many larvæ of _Coleoptera_,\r\nas a seventh leg. This circumstance excited a suspicion in the minds\r\nof both Mr. MacLeay sen., then visiting me, and myself, that after all\r\nthey might be _coleopterous_ larvæ. One, amongst other circumstances,\r\nhowever, seemed to militate strongly against this opinion; namely, that\r\nin this infinite number none appeared to differ in _size_.\r\n\r\n[382] PLATE XVII.

A very singular larva, which preys\r\nupon that of _Aleyrodes proletella_ Latr., if Reaumur's figure be\r\ncorrect (ii. _t._ xxv. _f._ 18-20), is of a perfect _Chilopodiform_\r\ntype, the abdominal legs being represented by a tubercle crowned by\r\na bristle: yet even this, which turns to a minute beetle (Ibid. _f._\r\n21), has some tendency to the _Anopluriform_ type.\r\n\r\n[395] \"Squilla _insectum a_ squilla _pisce parum differt_.\" Mouffet,\r\n319.\r\n\r\n[396] A remarkable difference obtains between the larva of the\r\nwire-worm and that of _Elater undulatus_. In the former, the last\r\nsegment is longer than the preceding one, terminating in a small\r\nacute mucro at the apex, with a deep cavity, perhaps a spiracle, on\r\neach side, at the base. In the latter, this segment is shorter than\r\nthe preceding one, forming above a nearly circular plate; the margin\r\nof which is a little elevated, and armed on each side with three\r\nteeth, and at the apex with a pair of furcate recurved horns, and\r\nwithout any basal spiracle.

I am inclined to\r\nbelieve, however, that this unnatural procedure was to be attributed\r\nto the circumstance of the female not having had it in her power to\r\nplace her eggs in the midst of _Aphides_, their proper food.\r\n\r\n[466] _N.

At first these grubs\r\nwere green, but they became gradually paler; and after a day or two\r\nbecame pupæ. But I mention this circumstance here for another reason:\r\nupon examining them after this last occurrence, I observed that they\r\nadhered to the lid of the box in which I kept the larva, arranged\r\nsomewhat circularly; and at a little distance from the anus of each\r\nwas a pea-green mass, consisting of about eight oval granules, which\r\nappeared like so many minute eggs. These were the excrement evacuated\r\nby each grub previously to its becoming a pupa. The appearance of\r\nthis little group, with their verdant appendage, formed a curious\r\nspectacle: they are still pupæ, July 30, 1822.\r\n\r\n[493] Except some species of _Polyammatus_ Latr. (_Thecla_,\r\n_Argynnis_ F.), _P. Argiolus_, _Corydon_, &c., and _Hesperia Rubi_,\r\n_Betulæ_ F., &c. Some of the larvæ of the former become pupæ within\r\nthe stalk of some plant, or partly under the earth: those of the\r\nlatter usually in a leaf to which the abdomen is fastened by various\r\nthreads. These last are the _rouleuses_ of the butterfly-tribe,\r\nliving, like some moths, in leaves that they have rolled up. _N.\r\nDict. d'Hist. Nat._ xxiv. 499.\r\n\r\n[494] PLATE XXIII.

De Geer ii. 893--. According to Rösel the same\r\ncircumstance attends the transformation of _Coccinella renipustulata_\r\nIllig. (_C. Cacti_ Ent. Brit.), which at first perplexed him not\r\na little. It is probable that in this case the retention of the\r\nskin was accidental; for some of the grubs of a _Mycetophila_, the\r\ntransformation of which I observed, became pupæ within their last\r\nskin, while others wholly disengaged themselves from it. The cause of\r\nthis variation, I conjectured, arose from the former being too weak\r\nto extricate themselves from the skin.\r\n\r\n[553] See above, VOL.

This, to include all, can only be defined,--that state\r\nintervening between the larva and imago, in which the parts and organs\r\nof the perfect insect, particularly those of sex, though in few cases\r\nfully developed, are prepared and fitted for their final and complete\r\ndevelopment in the last-mentioned state; and in which the majority of\r\nthese animals are incapable of locomotion, or of taking food.\r\n\r\nPupæ, like larvæ, may be separated into two great divisions:--\r\n\r\n  I. Those which, in general form, more or less resemble the larvæ\r\n      from which they have proceeded.\r\n\r\n  II. Those which are wholly unlike the larvæ from which they have\r\n      proceeded.\r\n\r\nI. To the first division belong, with some exceptions[562], the\r\n_Dermaptera_, _Orthoptera_, _Hemiptera_, and most _Aptera_, with the\r\nneuropterous tribes of _Libellulina_, _Ephemerina_, and the genus\r\n_Termes_, in the class _Insecta_; and the majority of the _Arachnida_.\r\nThis, like the first division of larvæ, may be subdivided into two\r\ncorresponding smaller sections; the first including those pupæ which\r\nresemble the larvæ, except in the relative proportion and number of\r\nsome of their parts; and the second those that resemble them, except in\r\nhaving the rudiments of wings, or of wings and elytra.\r\n\r\ni. The first subdivision will include the pupæ, if they may be so\r\ncalled[563], of insects of the _Aptera_ order, and of the class\r\n_Arachnida_: as, lice, _Poduræ_, _Lepismidæ_, centipedes, millipedes,\r\nmites, harvest-men, spiders, scorpions, &c. These mostly differ from\r\ntheir larvæ only in that the relative length or number of their legs,\r\nthe number of the segments of the body in some, or the development\r\nof their palpi, more nearly approach the characters of the perfect\r\ninsect; and in that while in their larva state they have two or\r\nmore skins to cast, previously to their assumption of the imago, in\r\ntheir pupa state they have but one. In fact, this last circumstance\r\nis the only one which, strictly speaking, characterizes the pupæ\r\nof this subdivision; as the changes which take place in the number\r\nand proportion of the organs are partly produced with each change\r\nof the larva's skin. And hence, as it is not easy to ascertain what\r\nnumber of skins a spider, for example, has yet to cast, and as\r\nboth the larva and pupa differ so little from the perfect insect,\r\nit is very difficult to determine in what state insects of this\r\ndivision are. From this difficulty has probably arisen the too great\r\nmultiplication of species in some of these tribes, particularly the\r\n_Arachnida_, the larva and pupa having been mistaken for perfect\r\ninsects. The pupæ of this subdivision were named by Linné _complete_,\r\nfrom the near resemblance which they bear to the imago.\r\n\r\nii. The second subdivision will include the pupæ of the _Dermaptera_,\r\n_Orthoptera_ and _Hemiptera_ orders, with few exceptions; as\r\nlikewise the _Libellulina_, _Ephemerina_, and _Termitina_? amongst\r\nthe _Neuroptera_: including the well-known tribes of earwigs,\r\ncockroaches, crickets, grasshoppers, locusts, lanthorn-flies,\r\nfroghoppers (_Cicada_ L.), bugs, plant-lice, dragon-flies, day-flies,\r\nwhite ants, &c. Of these, as in the former subdivision, the pupæ\r\nare equally capable of eating and moving with the larvæ, which they\r\nresemble, except in having the rudiments of wings, or of wings\r\nand elytra. The pupæ of the three orders first enumerated differ\r\nfrom those of the _Neuroptera_ in resembling the perfect insect in\r\nmost instances, both as to shape and the organs for taking their\r\nfood; and in all other respects, except in not having their wings\r\nand elytra fully developed[564]. The resemblance of the pupæ of\r\nthe _Libellulina_ and _Ephemerina_ to the perfect insects is more\r\ndistant, and the above organs in the two states are very dissimilar;\r\nfor the pupæ of the former are furnished with a prehensory mask\r\nsimilar to that of the larvæ before described[565], which the perfect\r\ninsect has not; and those of the latter with the usual oral organs\r\nof masticating insects, of which the imago has scarcely the rudiments.\r\n\r\nI have applied the term _rudiments_ to the wings and elytra in\r\nthis state, not in a strict sense, but merely to denote their\r\nappearance; for in fact the wings, &c. are complete, but only folded\r\nup longitudinally and transversely, and inclosed in membranous\r\ncases, which when the last change takes place remain attached to\r\nthe puparium or pupa-case. The tegmina or hemelytra in this state\r\nusually cover the wings, and the upper wings the under; but in the\r\n_Libellulina_ both are usually visible. Though commonly very small\r\ncompared with the instruments of flight in the perfect insect, some\r\nof these rudiments, contrasted with the majority, are of considerable\r\nmagnitude. This is the case with those of some species of _Chermes_,\r\nas we learn from De Geer[566].\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The second grand division comprises by far the largest number of\r\npupæ: those of all _coleopterous_, _strepsipterous_, _lepidopterous_,\r\n_hymenopterous_, _dipterous_, and _aphanipterous_, and by far the\r\nmajority of _neuropterous_ insects, as well as the _hemipterous_ genus\r\n_Aleyrodes_, and one sex of _Coccus_ of the same order. These pupæ,\r\nhowever, though agreeing in the circumstance of being unlike the larvæ\r\nfrom which they proceed, differ from each other in several respects,\r\nand require to be divided into three great sections, as under:--\r\n\r\ni. Those pupæ in which the _parts_ of the future insect, being\r\nfolded up under a membranous skin closely applying to each, are\r\ndistinctly _visible_. To this head belong generally, the pupæ\r\nof _coleopterous_[567] and _hymenopterous_ insects; those of\r\nthe _neuropterous_ genera _Myrmeleon_ and _Hemerobius_, &c.;\r\nthe _Trichoptera_; amongst the _Diptera_, _Culex_, _Tipula_ L.,\r\n_Tabanus_, _Bombylius_, &c.; and that of the flea (_Pulex_). These\r\nwere the _incomplete_ pupæ of Linné.\r\n\r\nii. Those pupæ in which the _parts_ of the future insect, being\r\nfolded up under a harder skin, are _less_ distinctly _discoverable_.\r\nTo this subdivision belong the pupæ of all _Lepidoptera_, and of them\r\nalone. These are what Linné termed _obtected_ pupæ.\r\n\r\niii. Those pupæ which are inclosed in the thick and opaque skin of\r\nthe larva, through which no _trace_ of the perfect insect can be\r\n_discovered_. These, which Linné termed _coarctate_ pupæ, include a\r\nlarge proportion of the _dipterous_ genera; as _Œstrus_ L., _Musca_\r\nL., _Empis_ L., _Conops_ L., &c. &c.[568]\r\n\r\nI shall next advert, chiefly to the pupæ of the grand division last\r\ndescribed, under the distinct heads of _substance_, _figure_, and\r\n_parts_; _colour_, _age_, _sex_, _motions_, and _extrication of the\r\nperfect insect_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\ni. As to their _substance_--at first interiorly all pupæ consist of\r\na milky fluid, in which the unformed members of the future perfect\r\ninsect may be said to float, and in which they may be discerned,\r\nand separated with the point of a pin[569]. In proportion as\r\nthese acquire consistency, and are more and more developed by the\r\nabsorption of the surrounding fluid, they occupy its place, and fill\r\nup the cavity of the puparium. The rest of this fluid passes off\r\nby transpiration[570]. Reaumur is of opinion that it is from the\r\nepiploon, or _corps graisseux_, that this matter is prepared, which\r\nhe regards as analogous to the white of an egg[571]. In _coarctate_\r\npupæ the included animal, or the pulp that contains its germes (in\r\nwhich the limbs and body at first are not discernible), fills at\r\nthis period the whole skin-cocoon; but in proportion as the above\r\nevaporation takes place, and the consolidation of the body and parts\r\nproceeds, it shrinks at each end, so that when near assuming the\r\nimago, a considerable cavity appears both at the head and tail of\r\nthe cocoon[572]. At this period of its existence, from the quantity\r\nof fluid included in the puparium, the animal weighs usually\r\nconsiderably more than it does when become a perfect insect[573].\r\n\r\nThe _exterior_ integument or _skin_ of pupæ, which is usually lined\r\nwith a very thin white pellicle, is of different consistence in\r\ndifferent orders. In the _Coleoptera_ and _Hymenoptera_ it is,\r\nwith a few exceptions, of a soft and membranous texture; in the\r\n_Lepidoptera_ (especially those that are not defended by cocoons),\r\nand _Diptera_, it is more rigid and harder, being either coriaceous\r\nor corneous. Lepidopterous pupæ, however, are not excluded from\r\nthe last skin of the larvæ with this hard covering. At the moment\r\nof this change the envelope is nearly as soft and membranous as\r\nin the order first mentioned. But they are besides covered with\r\na viscous fluid, which appears to ooze out, chiefly from under\r\nthe wings, and which very soon drying, forms the exterior hard\r\nshell[574]. At first the antennæ, wings, and legs, like those of\r\n_Coleoptera_ and _Hymenoptera_, can be each separated from the body;\r\nand it is only after these parts have been glued together by the\r\nfluid just mentioned, which takes place in less than twenty-four\r\nhours[575], that they are immoveably attached to the body of the\r\npupa, as we usually see them. In fact, the essential difference\r\nbetween incomplete and obtected pupæ seems to be, that in the former\r\nthe limbs and body are only covered each with a single membranous\r\nintegument, whereas in the latter they are besides glued together by\r\na substance which forms an additional and harder envelope. It is not\r\neasy to explain the alteration that takes place in the texture of the\r\nskin of such _dipterous_ pupæ as retain the skin of the larva. In the\r\nlatter this is generally a transparent and very fine membrane: yet\r\nthe very same integument becomes to the pupa an opaque and rigid case.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the skin of the greater number of pupæ is smooth,\r\nbut in those of many _Papilionidæ_ it is rugose and warty: this\r\nyou may see, particularly in that of _Papilio Machaon_. In many of\r\nthe hawkmoths (_Sphinx_ L.) it is covered with impressed puncta.\r\nIn _Attacus Io_ the upper side of the channels that separate the\r\nintermediate segments of the abdomen are curiously striated with\r\ntransverse striæ, formed of very minute granula, the lower side\r\nbeing transversely sulcated. In some few instances, as in _Arctia\r\nSalicis_, _Laria pudibunda_ and _fascelina_, the skin of the pupa is\r\nclothed with hair[576]: as is also that of _Hesperia Bixæ_, according\r\nto Madame Merian[577]. De Geer has described a little beetle under\r\nthe name of _Tenebrio lardarius (Latridius_ Latr., _Corticaria_\r\nMarsh.), the pupa of which is beset with very fine hairs, terminating\r\nin a spherical or oval button[578].\r\n\r\n\r\nii. I shall include under the same head both the _figure_ or shape,\r\nand _parts_ of pupæ, as the latter in most kinds are either the same\r\nor nearly the same as those of the larva, or merely incasing those of\r\nthe imago, so as not to require that detailed notice that I judged\r\nnecessary when treating of the parts of larvæ.\r\n\r\nWith regard to _incomplete_ pupæ, nothing further can be said of their\r\nextremely various _figure_, than that it has a general resemblance\r\nto that of the perfect insect. The head, trunk, abdomen, and their\r\nrespective external organs, are alike visible in both; but in the\r\npupæ, the latter, instead of occupying their natural situation, are\r\nall closely folded under the breast and abdomen: or, as in the case\r\nof the long ovipositors of some Ichneumons, laid along the back. In\r\na specimen of some coleopterous insect now before me, the following\r\nis the order of the arrangement of the parts:--The head is inflexed;\r\nthe mandibulæ are open; between them are seen the labium and labial\r\npalpi; these appear to cover and conceal the maxillæ, and the maxillary\r\npalpi extend on each side beyond them; the antennæ pass above the\r\nthighs of the two anterior pair of legs, and then turning down over\r\nthe breast between them and the posterior legs, repose upon the base\r\nof the wings; which also are turned down between the intermediate and\r\nposterior pair of legs, and rest upon the latter; the tibiæ are bent\r\nin and folded upon the thigh, and the tarsi turn outwards[579]. In\r\nanother coleopterous species, the wings and elytra are placed under\r\nthe hind-legs. In _Hymenopterous_ pupæ the antennæ appear usually to\r\nlie between the legs[580]. In many _Tipulæ_ the long legs are bent\r\ninto three folds in the pupæ; but the tarsi are extended, and lie\r\nclose to each other, the anterior pair being the shortest[581]. In a\r\nspecimen belonging to this tribe in my cabinet, which I think contained\r\n_Ctenocera pectinicornis_, the six leg-cases are of the same length,\r\nexactly parallel and adjacent, and being annulated wear the appearance\r\nof tracheæ[582]. These parts have each their separate case, so that a\r\npin may be introduced between them and the body: which cases, as well\r\nas the general envelope, are usually formed of a fine soft transparent\r\nmembrane; but sometimes, as in the lady-bird (_Coccinella_), the\r\ntortoise-beetle (_Cassida_), the crane-fly (_Tipula_), &c. it is harder\r\nand more opaque, so that though it is usually easy for a practised\r\nEntomologist from an examination of the pupa, particularly in the\r\n_Hymenoptera_, to predict to what genus the insect to be disclosed\r\nfrom them will belong, yet in these cases the organs being not so\r\nconspicuous, a less experienced examiner might be perplexed, and unable\r\nto come to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nAlthough _hymenopterous_ pupæ have usually no parts but what are\r\nafterwards seen in the perfect insect, this is not the case with\r\nseveral _coleopterous_ and _dipterous_ ones, which are furnished with\r\nvarious temporary appendages, indispensable to them to bring about\r\ntheir final change, or for other purposes. Thus, the pupa of the male\r\nof _Lucanus Cervus_ has two short, jointed anal processes[583]. That of\r\n_Hydrophilus caraboides_ has a pedunculated lunulate one; and moreover,\r\nthe sides of the abdominal segments, and the top of the thorax, are\r\nbeset with hairs, which are not seen in the perfect insect[584]. The\r\nabdomen of many, also, is armed with spines. That, the arrangement of\r\nwhose organs I lately described, has a quadruple series in the back of\r\nthis part; viz. on each of the first five segments, 3, 2, 2, 3. The\r\nfive first ventral segments also have on each side three spines; the\r\ninner are incurved, the intermediate nearly upright, and the outer\r\none recurved. These spines, except those of the innermost ventral\r\nseries, terminate in a bristle. In another coleopterous species the\r\nback part of the head is armed with a pair of lateral spines, and\r\nthat of the thorax with three processes, the external ones armed with\r\na single spine, and the intermediate one with a pair. De Geer has\r\nfigured the pupa of an _Asilus_, the head of which is armed with eight\r\nspines--two robust ones in front, and three smaller ones, connected at\r\nthe base on each side. The abdominal segments, also, are fringed with\r\nspines[585]. The abdomen of the pupa of _Ctenocera pectinicornis_ is\r\narmed with several strong conical spines, pointing mostly towards the\r\ntail, which is likewise the case with that of _Tipula lunata_[586].\r\nAs the above pupæ are usually subterranean or subcortical, the spines\r\nassist in pushing them out of the ground, &c. The respiratory horns\r\nthat proceed from the thorax of the pupæ of many of the aquatic gnats\r\nwill be noticed in another place. Those of _Corethra culiciformis_ and\r\nof some other aquatic gnat-like _Diptera_, have their anus furnished\r\nwith a pair of oars, or natatory laminæ, by which they rise to the\r\nsurface[587].\r\n\r\nThe figure of _obtected_ pupæ, or chrysalises, is more uniform.\r\nThey are commonly obtuse at the anterior extremity, and gradually\r\ncontracted to a point at the posterior, or tail. The outline usually\r\ninclines to a long oval or an ellipse; but in some, as _Attacus Io_\r\nand _Luna_, the pupa is shorter and more spherical. In _Geometra\r\nsambucaria_ it represents an elongated cone, and in _Hepialus_ it is\r\nnearly cylindrical. In the butterfly tribe (_Papilio_ L.) the outline\r\nis frequently rendered angular by various protuberances.\r\n\r\nIn all these pupæ may be distinguished the following parts:--_first_,\r\nthe _Head-case_ (_Cephalo-theca_), or anterior extremity; _secondly_,\r\nthe _Trunk-case_ (_Cyto-theca_), or intermediate part; and _thirdly_,\r\nthe _Abdomen-case_ (_Gastro-theca_).\r\n\r\n1. The _Head-case_ covers and protects the _head_ of the\r\ninclosed imago. From its sides behind proceed the antennæ-cases\r\n(_Cera-theca_); and before from the middle, the tongue-case\r\n(_Glosso-theca_). Just below the base of the antennæ-case you may\r\ndiscern the eye-cases (_Ophthalmo-theca_), surrounded on their inner\r\nside by a crescent-shaped lævigated piece, which may perhaps transmit\r\nsome light to the inclosed prisoner.\r\n\r\n2. The _Trunk-case_, divided into the _thorax_, or _upper_ surface,\r\nextending from the head to the dorsal segments of the abdomen,\r\nand consisting of three pieces, answering to the _prothorax_,\r\n_mesothorax_, and _metathorax_ of the perfect insect: the first\r\nanswering to the prothorax small, the second covering the mesothorax\r\nvery large, and the two next representing the metathorax, at first\r\nappearing to belong to the abdomen, but having no spiracle; and\r\nthe breast (_pectus_) or under-surface reaching from the head to\r\nthe ventral abdominal segments, from which proceed the wing-cases\r\n(_Ptero-theca_) and leg-cases (_Podo-theca_), which organs, with the\r\nantenna-cases and tongue-case, entirely cover, or rather form, the\r\nbreast. The arrangement of the whole is as follows:--The wing-cases,\r\nwhich are more or less triangular, and exhibit the larger nervures of\r\nthe wings, are a lateral continuation of the mesothorax, which turn\r\ndownwards from the sides of the breast, and cover, or replace, the\r\nthree first ventral segments of the abdomen. The _antenna-cases_,\r\nunited to the anterior portion of the head just behind the eye-cases,\r\nrepose immediately next to those of the wings running parallel with\r\ntheir inner margin. Then follow the legs, the tibiæ forming an angle\r\nwith the thigh, and the case of the anterior pair being innermost,\r\nand representing the breast-bone in the pupa. The tongue lies over\r\nthe forelegs, except in the case of some sphinxes, which I shall\r\nnotice afterwards: so that the glosso-theca covers both them and it.\r\n\r\n3. The abdomen-case consists of _nine_ segments when viewed on the\r\nback, and of only _six_ when viewed below; so that it might be said\r\nto have ten dorsal and six ventral segments: but the fact is, that\r\nthe place of the three anterior ventral segments, or rather ventral\r\nportions of the segments, (for they form complete rings without any\r\nlateral suture,) are replaced by the wings and other organs: in\r\nconsequence of this, the fourth segment, which is less covered than\r\nthe three first, at its posterior margin forms an annulus or ring. In\r\ncounting the abdominal segments of a pupa, you must be careful not to\r\ninclude the piece that represents the _metathorax_, which looks as if\r\nit belonged to the abdomen[588]. In the pupæ of _butterflies_ you will\r\ndiscover evident traces of _ten_ dorsal segments; but in many _moths_,\r\nand some _hawk-moths_, you will perceive at first only _eight_, or\r\neven _seven_, but a closer examination will enable you to discover\r\nthe line that marks out the others; and if you divide the puparium\r\nlongitudinally, and inspect its internal surface, you will see very\r\nvisible sutures between them. The intermediate segments are sometimes\r\nseparated from each other and the preceding and subsequent ones by deep\r\nchannels. In the pupa of _Papilio Machaon_ there is one such channel\r\nbetween the third and fourth segments. In _Bombyx regalis_ the channel\r\nis between the sixth and seventh, and in _B. imperatoria_ there are\r\nthree, namely, a channel between the third and fourth, and fourth and\r\nfifth, and fifth and sixth segments. The way in which insects with an\r\nexserted sting fold it in the pupa seems not to have been noticed; but\r\nfrom an observation of De Geer upon one species of _Ichneumon_, it\r\nappears to be turned up over the back of the abdomen[589].\r\n\r\nThese little animals, thus swathed and banded, exhibit no unapt\r\nrepresentation of an Egyptian mummy; though Lamarck applies the term\r\n_Mumia_ to _incomplete_ pupæ[590], to which it seems less happily\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\nChrysalises, as to the modifications of their general figure, may\r\nbe conveniently divided into two great classes: _first_, those that\r\nhave no angular projections, the anal mucro of some excepted, on\r\ndifferent parts of their body; and _secondly_, those which have such\r\nprojections. Each of these classes affords variations in its peculiar\r\ncharacters which require to be noticed.\r\n\r\n1. The first of these are called _angular_ pupæ[591], and are\r\nconfined to the _Butterfly_ or diurnal tribes. In some the head\r\nprojects into one short conical protuberance: this you may see in the\r\nchrysalis of the common cabbage butterfly (_Pieris Brassicæ_), and\r\nothers of the same genus[592]; in the brimstone-butterfly (_Colias\r\nRhamni_[593]), and in the beautiful purple emperor or high-flier\r\n(_Apatura Iris_ F.[594]): though in this last it is not conspicuous.\r\nBut the most remarkable instance of a single eminence from the head\r\nis exhibited by the pupa of a tropical butterfly (_Morpho Idomeneus_\r\nLatr.), figured by Madame Merian. In this the head projects into a\r\nlong incurved obtuse horn[595]. In others the head is armed with\r\ntwo mucros, or conical eminences. This is the case with the common\r\nbutterfly of the nettle (_Vanessa Urticæ_ F.[596]), and with that of\r\nthe beautiful _Papilio Machaon_[597]. In these the prominences are\r\ntrigonal. These processes, which in some, as in the peacock-butterfly\r\n(_Vanessa Io_), stand upright[598], and in others diverge (_Papilio\r\nMachaon_), form the eye-cases of the included imago; and in their\r\nouter base is planted the crescent-shaped piece I lately mentioned,\r\nwhich seems intended to convey light into it. In many the prothorax,\r\nbesides a lateral angular projection, has in the middle another\r\ntriangular or trigonal one, somewhat resembling a Roman nose; on\r\neach side of which is a smaller elevated black point: so that it\r\nrequires no great stretch of imagination to find out in it a sort of\r\nresemblance to the human face, which, though not quite so striking\r\nas honest Goedart figures it[599], is however very considerable.\r\nIn the pupa of _Morpho Menelaus_, figured by Madame Merian[600],\r\nthis nasiform prominence of the prothorax is extended into a long\r\narched horn, reaching to the middle of the abdomen. The pupa of the\r\nsilver-washed fritillary (_Argynnis Paphia_ F.), and others of the\r\nsame genus, exhibit beneath this nasiform prominence a very deep\r\ndepression, itself beset with one or more series of smaller angular\r\nelevations. The back of the abdomen is often furnished with two rows\r\nof protuberances, in some species larger, in others smaller[601];\r\nsometimes sharp and conical, and sometimes flat, and in some\r\ninstances resembling the fins of fishes[602]. These bosses usually\r\ndecrease in size towards the tail.\r\n\r\n2. The second kind of chrysalises are denominated _conical_[603].\r\nThese, which include the _crepuscular_ and _nocturnal Lepidoptera_,\r\nand the butterflies with _onisciform_ larvæ, have no protuberances,\r\nand are less variable in their form--their anterior extremity being\r\nalmost constantly oval and rounded, and their posterior conical and\r\nacute. An exception to this form is met with in the pupa of a moth\r\nlong celebrated (_Lasiocampa Pithyocampa_)[604], which has the head\r\nacute and the tail obtuse, and armed with two points[605]. Another\r\noccurs in that of the Cossus, which has two points on the head,\r\nby which it makes an opening in its cocoon: when it assumes the\r\nimago, one of these is placed below the other[606]. And some few\r\nhave the anterior end nearly flat instead of rounded. The pupa of\r\nthe orange-tip butterfly (_Pieris Cardamines_) seems intermediate\r\nbetween the angular and conical kinds: it is somewhat boat-shaped,\r\nand distinguished by a fusiform process from the head and tail[607].\r\nOther modifications of the usual figure are met with, but are for the\r\nmost part so slight as not to require notice. One or two, however,\r\nshould not be passed over. The pupæ of many hawk-moths (_Sphinx_\r\nL.) have the anterior piece of the head-case elongated into a sort\r\nof cylindrical proboscis, which is incurved beneath the breast: you\r\nwill find this formation in _S. Convolvuli_ and _Ligustri_[608]. In\r\nsome, as in a species figured by Madame Merian, that feeds upon the\r\n_Annona squamosa_, it is rolled up like a serpent in many folds[609].\r\nIn _Noctua Linariæ_ the tongue-case turns upwards, and is prominent\r\nlaterally beyond the body[610]. This singular appendage is one of\r\nthose beautiful instances of compensating contrivances, as Dr.\r\nPaley calls them, which perpetually occur in the insect tribes. The\r\ntongue of these hawk-moths is of very great length, often three\r\ninches, while the pupa itself is scarcely two; it could not possibly,\r\ntherefore, have been extended at length, as it is in common cases,\r\nbut is coiled up within the above protuberance. When the tongue is\r\nbut a little longer than the breast, the ordinary plan is adhered to,\r\nbut the apex of the breast projects a little over the abdomen into\r\na sort of nose, in which the end of the tongue is contained. This\r\nconformation may be seen in the pupa of _Noctua Gamma_, _Verbasci_,\r\nand many other species. Sometimes, as in _N. Linariæ_ F., this\r\nprojection is recurved into a short horn.\r\n\r\nI have before adverted to the _adminicula_ or short spines looking\r\ntowards the anus, with which the dorsal segments of the abdomen of\r\nsome pupæ are armed; and by which, when the time for their exclusion\r\nis arrived, they are enabled to push themselves upwards or outwards\r\nfrom their several places of confinement[611]: you will find these\r\nin the pupa of the great goat-moth (_Cossus ligniperda_); and in the\r\ncylindrical pupa of the moth called the ghost (_Hepialus Humuli_\r\nF.) there are two rows of sharp triangular spines on the back of\r\neach segment. These are not laid flat, but, as they do also in\r\nthe _Cossus_, form an acute angle with the body; which gives them\r\ngreater power of resistance. Those that constitute the row nearest\r\nthe base of the segment are longer than the anterior row, the middle\r\nspines than the lateral ones. The first and last segment are without\r\nthem, and the last segment but one has a sharp ventral transverse\r\nridge, armed with many sharp teeth[612]. The abdominal spines lately\r\nmentioned, of semicomplete pupæ, are also _adminicula_.\r\n\r\nThe tail of this description of pupæ is in many instances armed with\r\na mucro, or sharp point, emerging from its upper side. You will\r\nsee this in most hawk-moths. In the pupa of _Hesperia Proteus_ the\r\nmucro is truncate at the apex; in that of _Bombyx imperatoria_ it\r\nis long, and terminates in two diverging points. In the majority\r\nof chrysalises of both descriptions the tail is acute, and usually\r\nfurnished with hooks of different kinds. These are so various in\r\nshape and number, &c. that they would probably afford good characters\r\nfor discriminating many allied species. In some there are but two or\r\nthree, in others five or six, in others they are more numerous[613].\r\nSometimes they are quite straight[614], but most commonly recurved,\r\nso as to form a hook. The hawk-moths, and a few others, as _Bombyx\r\nPini_, _Cerura Vinula_, &c., have no anal hooks whatever. Under this\r\nhead I shall observe, that in many conical pupæ below the anal angle\r\nor mucro, is the appearance of a vertical foramen or passage: this is\r\nparticularly conspicuous in _Hepialus_, in which it is surmounted by\r\na bifid ridge, and has under it a pair of minute black tubercles.\r\n\r\nA pretty accurate judgement of the division to which the perfect\r\ninsect when disclosed will belong, may usually be formed from the\r\nfigure of its _chrysalis_. All the _angular_ ones, with scarcely\r\nany exception, inclose _butterflies_. The converse, however, does\r\nnot hold; for some that are not angular, as those of _Parnassius\r\nApollo_ and _Mnemosyne_, and most of the Linnean _Plebeii urbicolæ_,\r\nalso inclose flies of that description. With these exceptions, all\r\n_conical_ chrysalises give birth to _moths_ or _hawkmoths_. An idea\r\neven of the family or genus under which the perfect insect will\r\narrange, may be generally formed from the figure of the chrysalis;\r\nless distinctly, however, in the conical or rounded, than in the\r\nangular kinds, in which the prominences of the head and trunk, as\r\nbefore explained, usually vary in different families. Even the sex\r\nof some moths may be judged from the pupæ: those of females being\r\nthicker; and those also of the females that have no wings, or only\r\nthe rudiments of them, will of course vary somewhat from the ordinary\r\nform: but there is a still more striking difference in that of\r\n_Callimorpha? vestita_ F., and others of the singular tribe before\r\nnoticed[615], called by the Germans _Sacktrager_ (sack-bearers), from\r\nthe sack-like cases in which the larva resides. The females of these\r\nhaving not only no wings, but no antennæ, and legs not longer than\r\nthose of the larva, their pupa more resembles that of a _dipterous_\r\nthan of a _lepidopterous_ insect, it being not easy to determine\r\nwhich is the head and which the tail[616].\r\n\r\nIn these too we can often learn from the outline of the wing-cases,\r\nwhether the inhabitant of the chrysalis has these organs indented\r\nor intire. If the former, the margins of these cases are sinuate,\r\nas in that of _Vanessa C. album_; if the latter, they are intire,\r\nas in _Pieris Brassicæ_. Even in conical pupæ,--the size, the shape\r\nof the antennæ, which may be distinguished through the skin that\r\ncovers them, and slight modifications of the ordinary form,--give\r\nindications of the genus of the included insect sufficiently\r\nconclusive to a practised eye.\r\n\r\nThe true figure of _coarctate_ pupæ when they are mature, the parts\r\nof the future fly being very visible, and each being included in a\r\nseparate case[617], is that of those that belong to the _incomplete_\r\ndivision; but as this is a character not cognizable without dissection,\r\nit is customary, in speaking of pupæ of this description, to refer\r\nsolely to the shape of the exterior covering, which is in fact a cocoon\r\nformed of the dried skin of the larva moulded into a different form.\r\nIn this sense the figure of coarctate pupæ is extremely various. The\r\nmajority of them are more or less oval or elliptical, without any\r\ndistinct parts, were it not that they usually retain traces of the\r\nsegments which composed the larva's body[618]. Of this figure are the\r\npupæ of the common cheese-maggot[619], and many other flies. Others\r\n(_Sepedon_ Latr.) have the pupa shaped like a boat. That of _Scæva\r\nPyrastri_ F. assumes the figure of a flask; or, according to Reaumur's\r\nmore accurate comparison, of a _tear_[620]. The tail of many of these\r\npupæ, particularly of aquatic species, is elongated into a sort of\r\nbeak, either simple or forked, or is beset with spines variously\r\narranged. The pupa of _Stratyomis Chamæleon_, and other allied species,\r\ndiffers from all the rest of this subdivision in retaining the exact\r\nform of the larva[621]; and hence constitutes an exception to the\r\ngeneral character of our second great Division.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. There is much less variety in the _colour_ of pupæ than in that\r\nof larvæ. The majority of coleopterous and hymenopterous pupæ are\r\nwhite, or whitish; of lepidopterous and dipterous, brown of various\r\nshades, often verging on black in the former and on red in the latter.\r\nThe angular lepidopterous ones, however, are more gaily decorated.\r\nSome, _Pieris Brassicæ_, are of a greenish yellow, marked with spots\r\nof black; others are of a uniform green, _Apatura Iris_, _Pieris\r\nCardamines_; others, reddish, _Vanessa C. album_; others again red\r\nwith black spots, _Urania Leilus_[622]. A still greater number shine\r\nas though gilded with burnished gold--either applied in partial\r\nstreaks, _Vanessa Cardui_; or covering the entire surface, _Vanessa\r\nUrticæ_. It was from this gilded appearance in some _obtected_ pupæ\r\nthat the terms _Chrysalis_ and _Aurelia_ were applied to the whole.\r\nThe alchemists mistook this for real gold; and referred to the case as\r\nan argument in favour of the transmutation of metals. But Reaumur has\r\nsatisfactorily shown, that in this instance the old proverb is strictly\r\napplicable--\"All is not gold that glitters.\" He found that this\r\nappearance is owing to the shining white membrane immediately below\r\nthe outer skin, which being of a transparent yellow gives a golden\r\ntinge to the former; in the same way that tinfoil, when covered with a\r\nyellow varnish, assumes the metallic appearance which we see in gilt\r\nleather. He mentions, too, that for the production of this effect--it\r\nis essential that the inner membrane be moist: whence may be explained\r\nthe disappearance of the gilding as soon as the butterfly is ready to\r\nescape from the pupa. The shade of colour in these gilded chrysalises\r\nis various: some are of a rich yellow, like pure gold; others much\r\npaler; and some nearly as white as silver. That of _Hipparchia Cassiæ_\r\nF. is red with silver spots[623].\r\n\r\nThough by far the greater number of the chrysalises of moths are of\r\nan uniform chestnut, brown, or black,--a few are of other colours;\r\nas that of _Geometra alniaria_, which is of a glaucous blue; of\r\n_Noctua sponsa_, lilac; and of _Noctua pacta_, of a lovely blue,\r\ncaused by a kind of bloom, like that of a plum, spread upon a brown\r\nground. A similar bloom is found on that of _Parnassius Apollo_, and\r\non the anterior part of that of _Platypterix cultaria_ and _sicula_;\r\nin which last, Kliemann observed it to the be renewed when rubbed\r\noff[624] Many pupæ have the sheaths of the wings of a different\r\ncolour from that of the rest of the body; a few are variegated with\r\npaler streaks or bands, as _Clostera Anastomosis_, which has two red\r\nlongitudinal stripes down its dark-brown back; and that of the common\r\ngooseberry and currant moth, which may be found in every garden, has\r\nalternate rings of black and yellow[625].\r\n\r\nA few pupæ vary in their colour, as the painted lady-butterfly\r\n(_Vanessa Cardui_), some of which are light-brown with gray streaks\r\nand golden dots, others wholly of a golden yellow or brown, others of\r\na light green[626].\r\n\r\nAlmost all at their first assumption of the pupa state have a\r\ndifferent colour from that which they take a few days afterwards.\r\nThis last they retain until the disclosure of the perfect insect;\r\nexcept some that have transparent skins, which a few days previously\r\nto this period exhibit the colours of the included animal.\r\n\r\n\r\niv. There is as great variety in the length of the _age_ of Insects\r\nin their pupa as in their larva state. Some species continue in it\r\nonly _two_ or _three days_ (_Aleyrodes Chelidonii_ Latr., _Tinea\r\nproletella_ L.); others, as many _weeks_, or _months_, or even\r\n_years_. Each, however, has in general a stated period, which in\r\nordinary circumstances it neither much exceeds nor falls short\r\nof. The only general rule that can be laid down is--that _small_\r\npupæ continue in that state a shorter time than those of _larger_\r\nbulk. Thus, amongst coleopterous genera, the more minute species of\r\n_Curculio_ L.; amongst the _Hymenoptera_, the _Ichneumones minuti_\r\nL.; amongst the _Lepidoptera_, the subcutaneous tribes; and the\r\nmajority of the _Diptera_,--remain as pupæ only a few days or weeks:\r\nwhile the larger species in all these orders commonly exist in the\r\nsame state several months--many even upwards of _two_ years. There\r\nare, however, numerous exceptions to this rule; for some large pupæ\r\nare disclosed in a much shorter time than some others not a twentieth\r\npart of their bulk.\r\n\r\nThe reasons both of the rule and of the exceptions to it are\r\nsufficiently obvious. And first, as to the rule:--If you open a pupa\r\nsoon after its assumption of that state, you will find its interior\r\nfilled with a milky fluid, in the midst of which the rudiments of its\r\nfuture limbs and organs, themselves almost as fluid, swim. Now the\r\nend to be accomplished during the pupa's existence is, the gradual\r\nevaporation of the watery parts of this fluid, and the development of\r\nthe organs of the inclosed animal by the absorption and assimilation\r\nof the residuum. Reaumur, by inclosing a pupa in a stopped glass\r\ntube, collected a quantity of clear and apparently of pure water,\r\nequal to eight or ten large drops, which had evaporated from it, and\r\nwas condensed against the sides of the tube, and it was found to have\r\nlost an eighteenth part of its weight[627]. It is plain, therefore,\r\nthat this necessary transpiration, other circumstances being alike,\r\nmust take place sooner in a _small_ than in a _large_ pupa. Next, as\r\nto the exceptions:--Since the more speedy or more tardy evaporation\r\nof fluids depends upon their exposure to a greater or less degree\r\nof heat, we might _à priori_ conclude, that pupæ exposed to a high\r\ntemperature would sooner attain maturity, even though larger in bulk,\r\nthan others exposed to a low one:--and this is the fact. The pupa\r\nof a large moth, which has assumed that state in the early part of\r\nsummer, will often disclose the perfect insect in twelve or fourteen\r\ndays; while that of an Ichneumon, not one hundredth part of its size,\r\nthat did not enter this state till late in autumn, will not appear as\r\na fly for seven or eight months. But this is not the whole. The very\r\nsame insect, according as it has become a pupa at an earlier or later\r\nperiod of the year, will at one time live but a few weeks, at another\r\nseveral months, in that state. Thus, if the caterpillar of _Papilio\r\nMachaon_, one of those which has annually a double brood, becomes\r\na pupa in July, the butterfly will appear in _thirteen days_: if\r\nnot until September, it will not make its appearance until the June\r\nfollowing; that is, not in less than _nine_ or _ten months_: and the\r\ncase is the same with the pupæ of _Noctua Psi_, and of a vast number\r\nof other insects. To put beyond all doubt the dependence of these\r\nremarkable variations on temperature merely, it was only necessary\r\nthat they should be effected, as Lister long ago advised[628], by\r\nartificial means. This Reaumur accomplished. In the month of January\r\nhe placed the chrysalises of several moths and butterflies, which\r\nwould not naturally have been disclosed until the following May,\r\nin a hothouse: the result was, that the perfect insects made their\r\nappearance in less than a fortnight, in the very depth of winter;\r\nand by other numerous and varied experiments he ascertained, that in\r\nthis heated atmosphere five or six _days_ hastened their maturity\r\nmore than as many _weeks_ would have done in the open air. The\r\ndisclosed insects were in every respect perfect, and the females,\r\nafter pairing, laid their eggs, and then died, just as if they had\r\nnot been thus prematurely forced into existence. The converse of this\r\nexperiment equally succeeded:--by keeping pupæ the whole summer in an\r\nicehouse, Reaumur caused them to produce the fly one full year later\r\nthan their ordinary period[629].\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary fact leads us to a very singular and unexpected\r\nconclusion--that we have the power of lengthening or shortening the\r\nlife of many insects at pleasure; that we can cause one individual to\r\nlive more than twice as long as another of the same species, and _vice\r\nversâ_. Had Paracelsus made this discovery, it would have led him to\r\npursue his researches after the elixir of immortality with redoubled\r\nconfidence, and would have supplied him with an argument for the\r\npossibility of prolonging the life of man beyond its usual term, which\r\nhis sceptical opponents would have found some difficulty in rebutting.\r\nEven the logical Reaumur seems inclined to infer from it, that this\r\nobject of the alchemists was not so chimerical as we are wont to\r\nconclude[630]. He confesses, however, if it were to be attained only\r\nby the same process as effects the extension of an insect's life--by\r\nprolonging its state of torpor and insensibility,--that few would\r\nchoose to enjoy it on such conditions. The man of pleasure, blunted\r\nby excess of use to all modern stimuli, might perhaps not object to a\r\nsleep of a hundred years, in the hope of finding something new under\r\nthe sun when he waked; and an ardent astronomer would probably commit\r\nhimself with scientific joy to a repose as long and as sound as that\r\nof the seven sleepers, for the chance of viewing his predicted return\r\nof a comet, on stepping out of his cave: but ordinary mortals would\r\nconsign themselves to the perils of so long a night with reluctance,\r\napprehending a fate no better than what befel the magician, who\r\nordered himself to be cut in small pieces and put in pickle, with the\r\nexpectation of becoming young again[631].\r\n\r\nThe duration, then, of an insect's existence in the pupa state,\r\ndepends upon its bulk, upon the temperature to which it is exposed,\r\nand upon a combination of these two circumstances. This experiment\r\nappears very simple. We seem to ourselves to have accomplished what\r\nis so often undertaken in vain--to have found an entrance into the\r\ncabinet of Nature, and to have made ourselves masters of the contents\r\nof one of the pages of her sealed and secret book. We deceive,\r\nourselves, however: this book, when it seems most legible, is often\r\ninterlined with _sympathetic inks_, if I may so speak, which require\r\ntests unknown to us for their detection. If you lay up a considerable\r\nnumber of the pupæ of a moth now called _Eriogaster lanestris_,\r\nthe larva of which is not uncommon in June on the black-thorn,\r\nselected precisely of the same size, and exposed to exactly the same\r\ntemperature, the greater number of them will disclose the perfect\r\ninsect in the February following; some not till the February of the\r\nyear ensuing, and the remainder not before the same month in the\r\nthird year[632]. Mr. Jones of Chelsea, a most acute lepidopterist,\r\nin one of his excursions captured a female of _Arctia mendica_,\r\nanother moth, which laid a number of eggs, thirty-six of which\r\nproduced caterpillars: all these fed, spun their cocoons, and went\r\ninto the pupa state in the usual manner, but at the proper season\r\nonly twelve produced the fly. As this was no uncommon circumstance,\r\nhe concluded that the rest were dead: to his great astonishment,\r\nhowever, in the next season twelve more made their appearance; and\r\nthe following year the remainder burst into life, equally perfect\r\nwith the foregoing[633]. In this extraordinary result, which also\r\noccasionally has been observed to take place in the emperor-moth\r\n(_Saturnia pavonia_), the privet-hawkmoth (_Sphinx Ligustri_), and\r\nthat of the spurge (_S. Euphorbiæ_)[634], and other species,--it is\r\nclear that something besides mere size and temperature is concerned:\r\nfor, these circumstances being precisely alike, one pupa arrives\r\nat maturity in six months, and another of the same brood requires\r\nbetween two and three years. We can guess, that the end which the\r\nAll-wise Creator has in view, in causing this remarkable difference,\r\nis the prevention of all possibility of the destruction of the\r\nspecies. _Eriogaster lanestris_ and _Arctia mendica_, &c., for\r\ninstance, are doomed, for some reason unknown to us[635], to be\r\ndisclosed from the pupa in the cold and stormy months of February\r\nand March, almost every day of which in certain years is so ungenial\r\nthat few insects could then survive exposure, much less deposit their\r\neggs and ensure the succession of a progeny. Now, were all these to\r\nmake their appearance in the perfect state in the _same_ year, it\r\nmight happen that the whole race in a particular district would be\r\ndestroyed. But this possibility is effectually guarded against by the\r\nbeautiful provision under consideration, it being very improbable\r\nthat three successive seasons should be throughout unfavourable;\r\nand without such occurrence, it is clear that some of the race of\r\nthis moth will be preserved. In the case of other moths, whose pupæ\r\nthough disclosed in the summer are governed by the same rule, the\r\nprevention of the extinction of the species, by any extraordinary\r\nincrease in a particular year of their natural enemies, seems the\r\nobject in view[636]. But though the intention be thus obvious, the\r\nmeans by which it is effected are impenetrably concealed. What\r\nphysiologist would not be puzzled with the eggs of a bird, of which\r\none-third should require for their hatching to be sat upon only a\r\nfortnight, another third a month, and the remainder six weeks? Yet\r\nthis would be an anomaly exactly analogous to that observed by Mr.\r\nJones with respect to the pupæ of _A. mendica_. Reaumur found that\r\nwhen the skin of pupæ was varnished, so as to prevent absorption,\r\nthe appearance of the fly happened nearly two months later than in\r\nordinary circumstances. Are we to conjecture that those of the moth\r\njust mentioned, or of _E. lanestris_, that are latest matured, from\r\na greater degree of viscidity in the fluid that forms them[637],\r\nhave thicker and more impervious skins than those disclosed at an\r\nearlier period? Or are we to refer the difference to some unknown\r\npeculiarity of organization? On any supposition, the fact remains\r\nequally wonderful; and I know of none the illustration of which is\r\nmore worthy of the patient investigation of the physiologist.\r\n\r\nAs the period of maturity of the perfect insect is thus in some cases\r\nnot fixed even to years, and as in many it seems dependent upon such\r\nvariable causes; nothing appears more improbable than that it should\r\never be so strictly determined, that even the week in which the fly\r\nwill leave its pupa-case can be pretty accurately predicted. Such,\r\nhowever, is the fact with regard to the _Ephemera_ so interestingly\r\ndescribed by Reaumur, the myriads of which that issue from the banks\r\nof the Seine all appear in two or three days, somewhere between the\r\n10th and 18th of the month of August[638] in every year; at which\r\ntime the fishermen regularly expect them. A like regularity attends\r\nthe appearance of those described by Swammerdam, which every year,\r\nfor three days about the feast of St. John, issue in clouds from the\r\nRhine[639]--Not only is the week fixed, but in several instances\r\neven the hour. The Ephemeræ observed by Reaumur appear at no other\r\ntime than between _eight_ and _ten_ o'clock in the _evening_; and so\r\nunalterably is their exclusion fixed, that neither cold nor rain can\r\nretard it. Between these hours, in the evenings on which they appear,\r\nyou may see them fill the air, but an hour before or after, you will\r\nin vain look for one[640]. So also the silkworm-moth and the hawkmoth\r\nof the evening primrose (_Sphinx Œnotheræ_) constantly break forth\r\nfrom the pupa at _sunrise_: and the hawkmoth of the lime (_Smerinthus\r\nTiliæ_) as certainly at _noon_[641]. Schroeter states, that of\r\nsixteen specimens of the death's-head-hawkmoth (_S. Atropos_) which\r\nhe bred, every one was disclosed between _four_ and _seven_ o'clock\r\nin the _afternoon_[642].\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude this head, I must observe, that after a caterpillar\r\nor gnat has spun its cocoon, it sometimes remains for a considerable\r\nperiod before it incloses itself in the pupa-case, and casts off the\r\nform of a larva. Thus the little parasite (_Ichneumon glomeratus_\r\nL.) that destroys the caterpillar of the common cabbage-butterfly,\r\nremains a larva in its cocoon for many months, but it becomes a\r\nperfect insect a few days after it has put on its puparium[643]; and\r\nthe caterpillars of the great goat-moth (_Cossus ligniperda_), if\r\nthey spin their cocoon in the autumn, remain in it through the winter\r\nin the larva state; whereas, if they inclose themselves in the month\r\nof June, they assume the pupa, so as to appear as flies in three or\r\nfour weeks[644]. It is not therefore easy to state precisely the age\r\nof those pupæ which are produced from larvæ that spin cocoons.\r\n\r\n\r\nv. I have not much to say with regard to the _sex_ of pupæ. The male\r\nis probably to be distinguished from the female by being smaller; but\r\nin the first great division of pupæ, those which resemble the larvæ,\r\nand are locomotive, the female in numerous cases may be known by the\r\nOvipositor, or instrument for depositing her eggs in their proper\r\nstation: and the male also has his anal instruments. Sometimes in\r\nthis state the animal is so matured, as to be capable of continuing\r\nits kind. I have found the pupæ both of a _Gryllus_ L. and of a\r\n_Cimex_ L. _in coitu_.\r\n\r\n\r\nvi. Though the pupæ of the second great division are usually not\r\nlocomotive, yet I must not omit some notice of their _motions_. As the\r\nlegs of insects in this state are folded within a common or partial\r\nintegument, of course none of the pupæ now under consideration,\r\nwith the exception of those of the _Trichoptera_ order, can walk:\r\n_coarctate_ ones are even incapable of the slightest motion, and\r\nexhibit no symptom whatever of animation. Some of those that are\r\ntermed _incomplete_, however, and most chrysalises, have the power of\r\ncommunicating to their bodies a slight movement, extending more or\r\nless in different species, which is effected by the abdominal segments\r\nsolely. The latter, during the first twelve hours of being pupæ, when\r\ntheir skin is soft, frequently turn themselves, that the side on which\r\nthey lie may not be flattened; afterwards by far the majority merely\r\nwriggle or twist their abdomen when touched, or in any way incommoded\r\nor disturbed. We learn from De Geer, that the pupa of the ghost-moth\r\n(_Hepialus Humuli_), the cocoon of which is more than twice the\r\nlength of the chrysalis, moves in it from one end to the other[645].\r\nBonnet observed one of a moth (perhaps _Lasiocampa Quercus_), which\r\nalternately fixed itself at the top and bottom of its spacious and\r\nobliquely-fixed cocoon; descending slowly, but ascending as quickly,\r\nand almost in the same manner, as a chimney-sweeper in a chimney[646].\r\nThe pupa of the weevil of the water-hemlock (_Lixus paraplecticus_)\r\nwill move from one end of the interior of a branch to another by\r\nmeans of its _adminicula_, aided by the motion of its abdominal\r\nsegments[647]. But the most locomotive of pupæ of the second division\r\nare those of gnats, and many Tipulidans, which pass this state in the\r\nwater. These will move from the bottom to the surface, and back again,\r\nwith great facility and velocity. I have before mentioned several other\r\nmotions of pupæ[648], which I shall not repeat here, by which they\r\nextricate themselves from their several places of intermediate repose,\r\nbefore they leave the puparium: if the imago were to be disclosed in\r\nthe interior of a tree, or in the earth, its wings would be materially\r\ninjured in forcing its way out. The object of several of the above\r\nmotions may be to alarm insects that might attack these defenceless\r\nbeings. The twirling motion in particular, formerly noticed[649], in\r\nsome species, by causing a rustling against the sides of the cocoon,\r\nmakes a considerable noise--so singular in that of a red underwing-moth\r\n(_Noctua pacta_), that Rösel tells us, (who by the by was more timid\r\nthan becomes a philosopher,) that the first time he heard it, he had\r\nnearly thrown away the box that contained it, in his fright[650].\r\n\r\n\r\nvii. We are next to consider _The extrication of the perfect insect\r\nfrom the puparium, or pupa-case, and from the cocoon_. The period\r\nwhen the pupa has attained maturity, and the inclosed insect is ready\r\nto burst the walls of its prison, may be often ascertained. Just at\r\nthis time the colour frequently undergoes an alteration, the golden\r\nor silver tint of the gilded chrysalises vanishes; and those which\r\nare transparent, usually permit the form and colours of the insect\r\nwithin and the motions of their limbs to be distinctly seen through\r\nthem. In the _Libellulina_ the eyes become more brilliant[651]. The\r\nmature pupæ of the moth lately mentioned (_Eriogaster lanestris_)\r\nhave a particular swell of the abdominal segments, not apparent in\r\nthose that are to continue till another season, or longer[652]. Those\r\nof the case-worms (_Trichoptera_) push off the grates from the cases\r\nwhich they have hitherto inhabited, and swim about[653]. Other signs\r\nand motions doubtless predict the approach of this great change in\r\nother species, which have not been recorded.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which insects make their way out of the _puparium_\r\ndiffers in different orders. In _obtected_ pupæ, the struggles of\r\nthe included butterfly or moth first effect a longitudinal slit down\r\nthe middle of the thorax, where there is usually a suture for the\r\npurpose. The slit rapidly extends along the head, and down the parts\r\nwhich compose the breast, and the insect gradually withdraws itself\r\nfrom its case. It is not, however, from the outer skin merely that it\r\nhas to disengage itself, but also from a series of inner membranous\r\ncases, which separately inclose the antennæ, proboscis, feet, &c., as\r\na glove does the fingers; and similar cases inclose the parts of the\r\nperfect insect in pupæ of all the other orders. This is sometimes a\r\nwork of difficulty, but ordinarily it is effected with ease.\r\n\r\n_Incomplete_ and _semicomplete_ pupæ undergo nearly the same process,\r\nsave that in them the body is not swathed up in a common case; and\r\ntherefore they have only to liberate themselves from the partial\r\ncases that envelop the several parts of their body.\r\n\r\nIn _coarctate_ pupæ, as those of _Muscidæ_, _Syrphidæ_, _Œstridæ_, &c.,\r\nthe process is different. Their outer-case is ordinarily more rigid\r\nand destitute of the sutures, which in the former tribes so easily\r\nyield to a slight effort. Yet in these, at the anterior end under\r\nwhich the head of the fly lies, and from which it always issues, there\r\nis commonly a sort of lid, joined by a very indistinct suture to the\r\nrest, which can be pushed off, leaving a sufficient opening for the\r\negress of the insect. In the pupæ of many of this tribe this lid is\r\ncomposed of two semicircular pieces, which can be separately removed.\r\nMany species seem to be able to force off the lid of their puparium, by\r\nmerely pushing against it with their heads: but the common flesh-fly\r\nand many other _Muscidæ_, which are perhaps too feeble to effect this,\r\nor whose puparia are stronger than ordinary, are furnished with a very\r\nremarkable apparatus for this express and apparently sole purpose.\r\nThey are gifted with the power of introducing _air_ under the middle\r\npart of the head, to which the antennæ are fixed, and of inflating\r\nthat part into a sort of membranous vesicle as big as the head itself;\r\nby the action of which against the end of the pupa-case, the lid is\r\nsoon forced off. So powerful is this singular lever, that it is even\r\nsufficient to rupture the fibrous galls in which the pupæ of the\r\ngay-winged _Tephritis Cardui_[654] are inclosed. That it is designed\r\nby Creative Wisdom to answer this sole purpose seems proved, from its\r\ndisappearing soon after the disclosure of the fly, whose head shortly\r\nbecomes all alike hard. Reaumur suspects that it may also be intended\r\nto promote the circulation of the insect's fluids; but to me his\r\nreasons appear not conclusive[655]. In one instance a mode still more\r\nunexpected obtains. The illustrious naturalist just named found that\r\nthe fly which proceeded from one of the rat-tailed grubs (_Elophilus_\r\nLatr.) had actually the power of completely reversing its situation in\r\nits narrow case; and that it then employed its _tail_ in pushing off\r\nthe lid, which other species remove by means of their _heads_[656].\r\n\r\nThe extrication of insects whose pupæ are above ground, like those\r\nof butterflies, many beetles, flies, &c., is comparatively a simple\r\noperation. But what, you will ask, becomes of those species whose pupæ\r\nare concealed deep in the earth, or in the heart of the trees on which\r\ntheir larvæ have fed? Of this you shall be informed.--_Coleopterous_\r\ninsects disclosed from pupæ thus circumstanced, wait until their\r\norgans have acquired strength, and their elytra are sufficiently\r\nhardened to protect their filmy wings from damage in forcing their way\r\nthrough the earth or wood which covers them. Thus _Oryctes nasicornis_,\r\na rhinoceros beetle common on the Continent, is a full _month_ before\r\nit reaches the surface of the earth, after quitting its puparium. But\r\nit is evident that no delay would enable _lepidopterous_ or _dipterous_\r\ninsects, which are without elytra, to make their way out of such\r\nsituations, without irreparable injury to their delicate wings. Many\r\nof these, therefore, while still within the hard case of the pupa,\r\nhave the precaution, a few days previously to their exclusion, to\r\nforce themselves up to the surface of the earth, or, when they reside\r\nin the interior of trees, to the entrance of their hole. This is\r\neffected by a successive wriggling of the abdominal segments, which\r\nin several species, of the _Coleoptera_, _Lepidoptera_, and _Diptera_\r\norders, for this purpose, as has been more than once observed[657], are\r\nfurnished with sharp points (_adminicula_), admitting a progressive,\r\nbut not a retrograde motion. The puparia of the great goat-moth\r\n(_Cossus ligniperda_) may be often seen projecting from orifices in\r\nwillow-trees; and those of the common crane-fly (_Tipula oleracea_)\r\nfrom the surface of the earth, to which they have thus made their way\r\nfrom a depth of several inches.\r\n\r\nIn all the preceding instances the exclusion of the perfect insect\r\nis complete, as soon as it has withdrawn itself from the puparium.\r\nBut to a very large number, even after this is effected, the arduous\r\ntask still remains of piercing the cocoons of leaves, of thick\r\nsilk, of tough gum, or even of wood, in which the pupæ are incased.\r\nWe can readily conceive how the strong jaws of _coleopterous_ and\r\n_hymenopterous_ species may be employed to release them from their\r\nconfinement. But what instruments can be used for this purpose by\r\n_moths_ in a state of great debility, whose mouth has nothing like\r\njaws--merely a soft membranous proboscis? How shall the silkworm-moth\r\n(_B. Mori_) force its way through the close texture of a silken\r\nball, through which the finger could not be easily pushed? Or the\r\npuss-moth (_Cerura Vinula_) pierce the walls of its house of glue\r\nand wood, which scarcely yield to the knife? You will not doubt\r\nthat these difficulties have been foreseen by INFINITE WISDOM, and\r\nprovided against by INFINITE POWER. The egress of moths from their\r\ncocoons is secured in two ways;--either by some peculiarity in the\r\nfirst construction of the cocoon by the caterpillar, or by some\r\nprocess which the pupa or perfect insect is instructed to perform. As\r\nexamples of each, several curious instances may be cited.\r\n\r\nThe larva of the moth which about 1760 made such havoc in the\r\nprovince of Angoumois in France, becomes a pupa in the interior of\r\nthe grain of wheat which it has excavated; but the opening by which\r\nit first entered is not bigger than a pin's point, and is quite\r\ninsufficient for the egress of the moth. How, then, is the latter to\r\nforce its way through the tough skin which surrounds it? The larva,\r\npreviously to assuming the pupa state, gnaws out a little circular\r\npiece at that end of the grain where the head of the future moth\r\nwould lie, taking care not to detach it entirely. At this little\r\ndoor, which is sufficient to protect it from intruders, the moth\r\nhas but to push, when it falls down, and leaves a free passage for\r\nits exit. A contrivance almost similar is adopted by a caterpillar\r\nwhich feeds in the interior of the heads of a species of teazel\r\n(_Dipsacus_ L.), for a minute and interesting history of which we are\r\nindebted to Bonnet. This caterpillar previously to its metamorphosis\r\nactually cuts a circular opening in the head, sufficiently large\r\nfor the egress of the future moth; but to secure this sally-port\r\nduring its long sleep, it artfully closes it with fibres of the\r\nteazel, closely but not strongly glued together[658]. Another small\r\ncaterpillar described by the same author, resides in the leaf of\r\nan ash curiously rolled up into a cone, and then assumes the pupa,\r\nwhich is inclosed in a silken cocoon, ingeniously suspended by two\r\nthreads like a hammock in the middle of its habitation, and of so\r\nslight a texture that it presents no obstacle to the extrication of\r\nthe moth. It is the closely-joined sides of its leafy dwelling that\r\nform a barrier, which, were it not for the precaution of the larva,\r\nwould be impenetrable to so small and weak an animal. The little\r\nprovident creature, before its change to a pupa, gnaws in the leaf a\r\nround opening, taking care not to cut through the exterior epidermis.\r\nThis door is to serve the moth for its exit, like that formed by\r\nthe wheat-caterpillar. But in proportion to its bulk its verdant\r\napartment is of considerable size. How then shall the moth know the\r\nexact place where its outlet has been traced? How, without a clue,\r\nshall it discover in its dark abode the precise circle which requires\r\nonly a push to throw it down? Even this is foreseen and provided\r\nagainst. Out of twenty positions in which its hammock might have\r\nbeen slung, the caterpillar has been directed so to place it, that\r\nthe silken cord that suspends the head is fastened close to the side\r\nof the door which it has previously constructed; and the moth, guided\r\nby this _filum ariadneum_, at once makes its way out of an apartment\r\nwhich, but for this contrivance, might have been to it a labyrinth as\r\ninextricable as that of Minos[659].\r\n\r\nThe mode in which other caterpillars provide for their extrication,\r\nwhen become moths, from their silken cocoons, is not less ingenious.\r\nThose of _Eriogaster lanestris_ (of which I have lately said so much,)\r\nand others, form oblong cocoons, which, viewed externally, you would\r\nat the first glance assert were of one solid piece: but on examining\r\nthem more narrowly, you perceive one end of them to be a distinct\r\nlid, of a size large enough to permit the moth to issue out; and that\r\nit is kept in its place by a few slight threads, easily broken by\r\npressure from within[660]. A few pages back[661] I mentioned a cocoon\r\nformed by the larva of _Tortrix prasinana_, of the shape of a boat\r\nreversed, composed of two inclined walls fastened together at the\r\ntop and ends. In constructing this cocoon, it firmly glues to each\r\nother the top and one end, so as to form an impermeable suture; but\r\nthe other end, at which the moth is to issue, though externally it\r\nseems as strong as the rest, is merely drawn close by a slender thread\r\nor two fastened on the inside, and easily broken from within. And,\r\nwhat is particularly singular in the construction of this ingenious\r\nhabitation, the sides forming the end last mentioned, though originally\r\nrequiring force to draw them into their required position, become\r\nso elastic as to close again when the moth has passed between them\r\nand made her escape; the cocoon preserving its usual shape, even when\r\ndeprived of its inhabitant[662]. A similar cocoon is constructed by\r\nanother leaf-rolling caterpillar, that of _Tortrix chlorana_[663]. Many\r\nsimilar proofs of contrivance in the construction of silken cocoons\r\nmight be adduced, but I shall confine myself to one more only--I mean\r\nthat furnished by the flask-shaped brown one of _Saturnia Pavonia_,\r\nand some other moths. If you examine one of these cocoons, which are\r\ncommon enough in some places on the pear-tree or the willow, you will\r\nperceive that it is generally of a solid tissue of layers of silk\r\nalmost of the texture of parchment; but at the narrow end, or that\r\nwhich may be compared to the neck of the flask, that it is composed of\r\na series of loosely-attached longitudinal threads, converging, like so\r\nmany bristles, to a blunt point, in the middle of which is a circular\r\nopening[664]. It is through this opening that the moth escapes. The\r\nsilk of its cocoon is of so strong a texture and so closely gummed,\r\nthat had both ends been similarly closed, its egress would have been\r\nimpracticable; it finds, however, no difficulty in forcing its way\r\nthrough the aperture of a sort of reversed funnel, formed of converging\r\nthreads that readily yield to pressure from within. But an objection\r\nwill here probably strike you. You will ask, Is not this facility of\r\negress purchased at too dear a rate? Must not a chrysalis in an open\r\ncocoon be exposed to the attacks of those ichneumons of which you\r\nhave said so much, and of numerous other enemies, which will find\r\nadmittance through this vaunted door? Our caterpillar would seem to\r\nhave foreseen your dilemma; at least, under heavenly guidance, she\r\nhas guarded against the danger as effectually as if she had. If you\r\ncut open the cocoon longitudinally, you will see that within the\r\nexterior funnel-shaped end, at some distance she has framed a second\r\nfunnel, composed of a similar circular series of stiff threads, which,\r\nproceeding from the sides of the cocoon, converge also to a point, and\r\nform a sort of cone exactly like the closed peristome of a moss; or,\r\nto use a more humble though not less apt illustration, like the wires\r\nof certain mousetraps[665]. In this dome not the slightest opening is\r\nleft, and from its arched structure it is impenetrable to the most\r\nviolent efforts of any marauders from without; whilst it yields to\r\nthe slightest pressure from within, and allows the egress of the moth\r\nwith the utmost facility. When she has passed through it, the elastic\r\nthreads resume their former position, and the empty cocoon presents\r\njust the same appearance as one still inhabited. Rösel relates with\r\namusing naïvété how this circumstance puzzled him the first time he\r\nwitnessed it: he could scarcely help thinking that there was something\r\nsupernatural in the appearance of one of these fine moths in a box\r\nin which he had put a cocoon of this kind, but in which he could not\r\ndiscover the slightest appearance of any insect having escaped from\r\nit, until he slit it longitudinally[666]. But from an observation of\r\nMeinecken, it appears that these converging threads serve a double\r\npurpose; being necessary to compress the abdomen of the moth as it\r\nemerges from the cocoon, which forces the fluids to enter the nervures\r\nof the wings, and give them their proper expansion. For he found, that\r\nwhen the pupa is taken out of the cocoon, the moth is disclosed at the\r\nproper time, but remains always crippled in its wings; which never\r\nexpand properly, unless the abdomen be compressed with the finger and\r\nthumb, so as to imitate the natural operation[667].\r\n\r\nI am next to give you some account of the _second_ mode in which the\r\nrelease of the perfect insect from its cocoon is effected--that,\r\nnamely, wherein its own exertions chiefly accomplish the work. I\r\nshall from a large number select only a few instances. The texture\r\nof the cocoon of the silkworm-moth is uniform in every part, and the\r\nlayers of silk are equally thick at both ends. The moth makes its\r\nway out by cutting or breaking these threads at the end opposite\r\nto its head: an operation which, as it destroys the continuity of\r\nthe silk, those who breed these insects are particularly careful\r\nto guard against, by exposing the cocoon to heat sufficient to\r\ndestroy the included pupa. The question is--What instruments does\r\nthe moth employ to effect this? And this we are not able to answer\r\nsatisfactorily. Malpighi asserts that the animal first wets the\r\nsilk with a liquid calculated to dissolve the gum that connects the\r\nthreads, and then employs its lengthened head to push them aside and\r\nmake an opening[668]. But, as Reaumur has observed, besides that\r\nso obtuse a part as the head of a moth is but ill fitted to act as\r\na wedge, we find the threads not merely pushed to each side, but\r\nactually cut asunder. He therefore infers that the eyes, which are\r\nthe only hard organs of the head, are the instruments by which the\r\nthreads are divided--their numerous minute facets serving the purpose\r\nof a fine file[669]. It should be observed, however, that Mr. Swayne\r\nconfirms Malpighi's assertion, that the silkworm does not cut, but\r\nmerely pushes aside, the threads of its cocoon; and he informs us\r\nthat he has proved the fact, by unwinding a pierced cocoon, the\r\nthread of which was entire[670]. Yet Reaumur's correctness cannot be\r\nsuspected: and he affirms, that from observation there can scarcely\r\nbe a doubt that most of the threads are broken[671]; which is further\r\nconfirmed in an account of the breeding of silk-worms published in\r\nthe _American Philosophical Transactions_: in which it is expressly\r\nstated, that cocoons out of which the fly has escaped, cannot be\r\nwound[672]. Analogy, it must be confessed, is against Reaumur's\r\nopinion; since other kinds of silkworms make their escape by means\r\nof a _fluid_. Thus we are informed by Dr. Roxburgh, that _Attacus\r\nPaphia_, when prepared to assume the imago, discharges from its\r\nmouth a large quantity of liquid, with which the upper end of the\r\ncase is so perfectly softened, as to enable the moth to work its way\r\nout in a very short space of time,--an operation which, he says, is\r\nalways performed in the night[673]. Perhaps the two opinions may be\r\nreconciled, by supposing the silkworm first to moisten and then break\r\nthe threads of its cocoon. In those that are of a slighter texture,\r\na mere push against the moistened end is probably sufficient: and\r\nhence we find in so many newly disclosed moths the hair in that part\r\nwet, and closely pressed down[674]. If it be apparently difficult\r\nfor the silkworm-moth to effect an opening in its cocoon, how much\r\nharder must seem the task of the puss-moth (_Cerura Vinula_) to\r\npierce the solid walls of its wood-thickened case? Here the eyes\r\nare clearly incompetent; nor could any ordinary fluid assist their\r\noperation, for the gum which unites the ligneous particles is\r\nindissoluble in _aqueous_ menstrua. You begin to tremble for the\r\nfate of the moth incarcerated in such an impervious dungeon--but\r\nwithout cause: what an _aqueous_ solvent cannot effect, an _acid_ is\r\ncompetent to: and with a bag of such acid our moth is furnished. The\r\ncontents of this she pours out as soon as she has forced her head\r\nthrough the skin of the chrysalis, and upon the opposite end of the\r\ncocoon. The acid instantly acts upon the gum, loosens the cohesion\r\nof the grains of wood, and a very gentle effort suffices to push\r\ndown what was a minute ago so strong a barrier. How admirable and\r\neffectual a provision! But there is yet another marvel connected\r\nwith it. Ask a chemist, of what materials a vessel ought to be to\r\ncontain so potent an acid: he will reply,--of glass. Yet our moth\r\nhas no glass recipient: her bottle is a membranous bag; but of so\r\nwonderful a fabric as not to be acted upon by a menstruum which a\r\ngum, apparently of a resinous nature, is unable to resist! This fact\r\ncan only be explained by the analogous insensibility of the stomach\r\nto the gastric juice, which in some animals can dissolve bone,--and\r\nit is equally worthy of admiration. In both cases, the vitality of\r\nthe membranous or fleshy receptacle secures it from the action of the\r\nincluded fluid; but _how_--who shall explain?\r\n\r\nOrdinarily it is the moth that breaks the cocoon; but in the goat-moth\r\nand many _Tortrices_ it is the pupa itself that performs the work,\r\neither wholly or partially. The pupa of the former is for this purpose\r\nfurnished with sharp points upon the head, capable of effecting this\r\nobject[675]. The locust-moth, another species of _Cossus_ (_C. Robiniæ_\r\nPeck), whose history has been admirably detailed by Professor Peck,\r\nhas a different process. \"In the silk-moth,\" says he, \"and all others\r\nwhich I have had opportunity to observe, the chrysalis bursts _in_ the\r\ncocoon, and the fluid which surrounded the new insect in it escaping\r\nat the same time, so weakens or dissolves the fibre and texture of\r\nthe silk, that the moth is able to extricate itself, leaving the\r\nchrysalis behind it; but this is not the manner in the locust-moth.\r\nAfter remaining till all its parts are fully grown and it is ready to\r\nquit its prison, a certain quantity of exercise is necessary, to break\r\nthe ligaments which attach the moth to the shell of the chrysalis, and\r\nto loosen the folds of the abdomen. In taking this exercise, it can\r\nonly move the abdomen in various directions: as one side of the rings\r\nis moved forward, the hooks in the serrated lines above mentioned (the\r\n_adminicula_) take hold of the silk, and prevent their sliding back;\r\nthe next flexure brings forward the opposite side of the rings, which\r\nare prevented by the points on that side from slipping back in the\r\nsame manner, and the chrysalis is forced out of the slightly woven\r\nextremity of the cocoon, and through the silk-lined cavity, till it is\r\nprotruded for about one-third of its length out of the opening in the\r\nbark, and into the air[676].\"\r\n\r\nAn exception to the general rule--that the rupturing of the cocoon is\r\nthe business of the inclosed insect itself--is met with amongst ants;\r\nthe workers of which not only feed the young, but actually make an\r\naperture in their cocoons, cutting the threads with their mandibles\r\nwith admirable dexterity and patience, one by one, at the time they\r\nare ready to emerge, the precise period for which these indefatigable\r\nnurses are well aware of, that they may meet with no obstacle. Without\r\nthis aid, the young ant would be unable to force its way through the\r\nstrong and dense coating of silk that infolds it[677]. And a proceeding\r\nsomewhat akin to this was observed by the Hon. Captain Percy, R.N., who\r\nhimself related it to me. Being fond of the study of insects, he was\r\nin the habit of attending to their motions; and in the beginning of\r\nSeptember 1821 noticed those of a number of female _Tipulæ_, probably\r\n_T. oleracea_ L., busily engaged in depositing their eggs amongst the\r\nroots of grass. While observing these proceedings, he at the same time\r\nsaw one quitting its pupa-case, which had already by its own efforts\r\ngot its head, thorax, and anterior legs out of it. It was then joined\r\nby two _male_ flies; which, with their anal forceps and posterior legs\r\ntaking hold of the pupa-case, appeared with their mouths and anterior\r\nlegs to push the little prisoner upwards, moving her backwards and\r\nforwards; and as they kept raising her, shifting their hold of the\r\nskin till she was entirely extricated, when they left her to recover\r\nher strength by herself. Probably the extreme length of the two pair\r\nof hind-legs of these animals may render such assistance necessary for\r\ntheir extrication.\r\n\r\nThere remains yet to be explained under this head the manner in\r\nwhich the perfect insect is excluded from certain aquatic pupæ; such\r\nas those of _Phryganeæ_, gnats, and one of those _Tipulidæ_ that\r\nresemble gnats. These pupæ (perhaps that they may be safe from the\r\nattack of birds) are destined to remain during the greater part of\r\ntheir existence in this state at the bottom of the water. But it is\r\nobvious that if the perfect insects were there to be disclosed, their\r\nwings would be wetted, and they would be drowned. It is the provision\r\nby which this result is obviated that now calls for your attention.\r\n\r\nYou have already been told that the larvæ of _Phryganeæ_ inclose\r\nthemselves in cases of different materials, open at each end[678]. You\r\nhave also learned, that in becoming pupæ, they secure each end of their\r\ncases with a grating of silk[679]. When that change has occurred, they\r\nremain motionless at the bottom of the water. Now how are these pupæ,\r\nencased in tubes of a greater specific gravity than the surrounding\r\nfluid, to make their way to the surface when the time has arrived\r\nfor their becoming denizens of the air? This they accomplish in the\r\nfollowing manner:--The pupa is furnished with two strong exterior\r\nmoveable mandibuliform processes, and has the power of moving its four\r\nanterior legs and antennæ while in the pupa-case. With these temporary\r\n_jaws_ it makes an opening in one of the silken doors of its case,\r\nforces its way out at that end, and then by moving its legs, the cases\r\nof which in some species are ciliated for this very purpose, swims to\r\nthe surface, where its skin splits, and discloses the included insect.\r\nThat these jaws are given for the express and exclusive purpose of\r\nbeing thus applied, seems undeniable. The pupa eats nothing--they are\r\ntherefore in every other point of view superfluous. They are given to\r\nit alone of all other similar pupæ, because unnecessary to all others;\r\nand they are cast off along with the rest of the puparium, the perfect\r\ninsect having no vestige of jaws[680].\r\n\r\nThe _gnat_ has to undergo its change on the surface of the water--How\r\nis it to accomplish this without being wetted? In the pupa state\r\nthey usually remain suspended with the posterior end of the body\r\nturned downwards: but when the period for its change is arrived,\r\nit stretches it out upon the surface, above which its thorax is\r\nelevated. Scarcely has it been a moment in this position, than,\r\nswelling out the interior and anterior parts of the thorax, it\r\ncauses it to split between the two respiratory horns. Through this\r\nopening the anterior part of the gnat then emerges. As soon as the\r\nhead and trunk are disengaged, it proceeds with its labour, and gets\r\nout more and more; elevating itself so as to appear in the puparium\r\nlike a mast in a boat. As it proceeds, the mast is more and more\r\nelevated and lengthened, till it becomes nearly perpendicular--just\r\nas the mast of a boat is gradually raised from a nearly horizontal\r\nto a vertical position: at this period a very small portion of the\r\nabdomen remains in the puparium. Neither its legs nor wings are of\r\nany use in maintaining it in this position. The latter are too soft,\r\nand, as it were, folded; and the former are stretched out along\r\nthe abdomen--the segments of this last part are the only agents.\r\nThe observer who sees how the little boat gradually sinks, and how\r\nits margin approaches the water, forgets the mischievous insect it\r\ncontains, which at another time he would crush without remorse, and\r\nbecomes interested for its fate; especially should wind agitate the\r\nwater. A very little is sufficient to drive about rapidly the little\r\nvoyager, since it catches the wind in some degree as a sail. If it\r\nshould be upset, it would be all over with it;--and numbers do thus\r\nperish. The gnat, after having fixed itself thus perpendicularly,\r\ndraws first its two anterior legs out of their case, and moves them\r\nforward, and next the two intermediate ones; then inclining itself\r\ntowards the water, it rests its legs upon it, for water is to them a\r\nsoil sufficiently firm and solid to support them, although surcharged\r\nwith the weight of the insect's body. As soon as it is thus upon the\r\nwater, it is in safety; its wings unfold themselves and are dried,\r\nand it flies away. All this is the work of an instant[681].\r\n\r\nThe pupæ of _Chironomus plumosus_ proceed from those red worm-like\r\nlarvæ so common throughout the summer in tubs of rain-water, &c.,\r\ndescribed by Reaumur[682]. They are not inclosed in cases, but are of\r\na greater specific gravity than the water at the bottom of which they\r\nreside, until within a few hours of the exclusion of the fly. They have\r\nthe power of swimming, however; and by moving the tail alternately\r\nbackwards and forwards, can slowly raise themselves to the top of\r\nthe water. But here occurs a difficulty. For the extrication of the\r\nimago it is necessary that they should remain quietly suspended at\r\nthe surface; and moreover that the thorax, in which the opening for\r\nits exit is to be made, should be at least level with it: and this is\r\nprecisely what takes place. If you watch one of these pupæ when it\r\nascends from the bottom, you will see that as soon as it has reached\r\nthe top it remains suspended there motionless; and that its thorax\r\nis the highest part of the body, and level with the surface. Now the\r\nquestion is, in what way this is accomplished? How can a pupa of\r\ngreater specific gravity than water, remain suspended without motion at\r\nits surface? and how can its thorax, which is at its heaviest end, be\r\nkept uppermost?--By a most singular and beautiful contrivance, which I\r\nshall explain; the more particularly because it has escaped Reaumur,\r\nand, as far as I know, all other entomological observers. The middle of\r\nthe back of the thorax has the property of repelling water--apparently\r\nfrom being covered with some oily secretion. Hence, as soon as the pupa\r\nhas once forced this part of its body above the surface, the water is\r\nseen to retreat from it on all sides, leaving an oval space in the\r\ndisk, which is quite dry. Now though the specific gravity of the pupa\r\nis greater than that of water, it is but so very slightly greater, that\r\nthe mere attraction of the air to the dry part of the thorax, when once\r\nexposed to it, is sufficient to retain it at the surface; just as a\r\nsmall dry needle swims under similar circumstances. That this is a true\r\nsolution of the phænomenon, I am convinced by the result of several\r\nexperiments. If, when the pupa is suspended at the surface, a drop of\r\nwater be let fall upon the dry portion of the thorax, it instantly\r\nsinks to the bottom,--the thorax, which belongs to the heaviest half,\r\nbeing the lowest; and if the pupa be again brought to the surface, so\r\nthat the fluid is repelled from its disk, it remains suspended there\r\nwithout effort, as before. Just previously to the exclusion of the fly,\r\nthe dry part of the thorax is seen to split in the middle. The air\r\nenters, and forms a brilliant stratum resembling quicksilver, between\r\nthe body of the insect and its puparium; and the former pushing forth\r\nits head and forelegs, like the gnat, rests the latter upon the water,\r\nand in a few seconds extricates itself wholly from its envelope.\r\n\r\nBefore I close this letter, I must state a fact connected with the\r\nsubject of it that deserves to be recorded. It is a general rule,\r\nthat _one_ pupa-case incloses only _one_ insect; but Kleesius, a\r\nGerman entomologist, asserts that he had once _two_ specimens of\r\n_Gastropacha quercifolia_ produced from _one_ pupa; which was large,\r\nbeing full two inches long, and one thick.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[562] In the _Hemiptera_ the male _Cocci_ (Reaum. iv. 32.) and\r\n_Aleyrodes_ (Ibid. ii. 311.) belong to the second division.\r\n\r\n[563] The terms _larva_ and _pupa_, applied to the insects of this\r\nsubdivision, are perhaps not strictly proper.\r\n\r\n[564] The larvæ and pupæ of many of the _homopterous_ section of\r\n_Hemiptera_ differ often from the imago, not only in their fore-legs\r\n(PLATE XVI. FIG. 4.), but also in other respects. I have the larva of\r\na _Centrotus_ from Canada, given me by Dr. Bigsby, which has a long\r\nanal process or tail.\r\n\r\n[565] See above, p. 125--.\r\n\r\n[566] iii. 135.\r\n\r\n[567] The pupæ of _Cassida_, _Imatidium_, &c. seem to vary somewhat\r\nfrom this type, the upper part being neither membranous nor\r\nexhibiting distinctly the form of the inclosed imago.\r\n\r\n[568] The following arrangement of pupæ is perhaps in some respects\r\nbetter than that above given. But it is scarcely possible to propose\r\none free from objections.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Capable of eating and walking.\r\n\r\n  i.

These he\r\nfurther subdivides into two kinds.\r\n\r\n1. _Chrysalis signata._ This term is synonymous with the _Pupa\r\nobtecta_ of Linné, or the _Chrysalis_ of _Lepidoptera_ and some\r\n_Diptera_.\r\n\r\n2. _Chrysalis dolioloides._ Equivalent to the _Pupa coarctata_ Linn.\r\npeculiar to those _Diptera_ that assume this state in the skin of the\r\nlarva.\r\n\r\nii. _Mumia._ All inactive pupæ which are covered by a transparent\r\nskin, through which all the parts of the inclosed imago may be seen,\r\nsubdivided also into two.\r\n\r\n1. _Mumia coarctata._ Corresponding with the _Pupa incompleta_ Linn.,\r\nwhich includes the _Coleoptera_ and most of the _Hymenoptera_.\r\n\r\n2. _Mumia pseudonympha_, confined to the Pupa of _Phryganea_ and some\r\nothers. This might be named _Pupa subincompleta_.\r\n\r\niii. _Nympha._ Under this denomination are included all insects that\r\nundergo only a partial metamorphosis, and are active in their pupa\r\nstate, corresponding with the _Pupa semicompleta_ Linn. and also\r\n_subsemicompleta_ MacLeay. See _Anim. sans Vertebr._ iii. 285--.\r\n\r\nM. Latreille has started an ingenious idea on this subject with\r\nregard to these kinds of metamorphosis, which comprehends both larva\r\nand pupa under a distinct denomination: as thus--\r\n\r\n1. _Demilarve_ and _Deminymph_, synonymous with the _Semicomplete\r\nMetamorphosis_. 2. _Larve_ and _Nymph_, answering to _Incomplete\r\nMetamorphosis_. 3. _Caterpillar_ and _Chrysalis_, answering to\r\n_Obtected Metamorphosis_. 4. _Vermilarve_ and _Pupa_, answering to\r\n_Coarctate Metamorphosis_. _N.

It is now termed an _Imago_, or\r\nperfect insect; and is capable of propagation.\r\n\r\nJust after its exclusion, it is weak, soft, and languid: all its\r\nparts are covered with moisture; and, if a winged insect, its wings\r\nhave so little the appearance, either in shape, size, or colour,\r\nwhich they are about to assume, that it might be taken for a\r\nmutilated abortion, rather than an animal in the most vigorous stage\r\nof life. If it be a beetle, its elytra, instead of covering the\r\nback of the abdomen, are folded over the breast: their substance is\r\nsoft and leathery, and their white colour exhibits no traces of the\r\nseveral tints which are to adorn them. If the insect be a butterfly\r\nor a moth, the wings, instead of being of their subsequent amplitude,\r\nand variegated and painted with a variety of hues and markings, are\r\nin large species scarcely bigger than the little finger nail, falling\r\nover the sides of the trunk, and of a dull muddy colour, in which no\r\ndistinct characters can be traced. If the excluded insect be a bee\r\nor a fly, its whole skin is white and looks fleshy, and quite unlike\r\nthe coloured hairy crust which it will turn to in an hour or two; and\r\nthe wings, instead of being a thin, transparent, expanded film, are\r\ncontracted into a thick, opaque, wrinkled mass.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms of debility and imperfection, however, in most\r\ncases speedily vanish. The insect, fixing itself on the spoils of\r\nthe pupa, or some other convenient neighbouring support, first\r\nstretches out one organ, and then another: the moisture of its skin\r\nevaporates, the texture becomes firm, the colours come forth in all\r\ntheir beauty; the hairs and scales assume their natural position;\r\nand the wings expanding, extend often to five or six times their\r\nformer size--exhibiting, as if by magic, either the thin transparent\r\nmembranes of the bee or fly, or the painted and scaly films of\r\nthe butterfly or moth, or the coloured shells of the beetle. The\r\nproceedings here described I witnessed very recently with regard\r\nto a very interesting and beautiful butterfly, the only one of its\r\ndescription that Britain has yet been ascertained to produce--I mean\r\n_Papilio Machaon_. The pupa of this being brought to me by a friend\r\nearly in May this year (1822), on the sixteenth of that month I had\r\nthe pleasure to see it leave its puparium. With great care I placed\r\nit upon my arm, where it kept pacing about for the space of more than\r\nan hour; when all its parts appearing consolidated and developed, and\r\nthe animal perfect in beauty, I secured it, though not without great\r\nreluctance, for my cabinet--it being the only living specimen of this\r\nfine fly I had ever seen. To observe how gradual, and yet how rapid,\r\nwas the development of the parts and organs, and particularly of the\r\nwings, and the perfect coming forth of the colours and spots, as the\r\nsun gave vigour to it, was a most interesting spectacle. At first\r\nit was unable to elevate or even move its wings; but in proportion\r\nas the aërial or other fluid was forced by the motions of its trunk\r\ninto their nervures, their numerous corrugations and folds gradually\r\nyielded to the action, till they had gained their greatest extent,\r\nand the film between all the nervures became tense. The ocelli, and\r\nspots and bars, which appeared at first as but germes or rudiments\r\nof what they were to be, grew with the growing wing, and shone forth\r\nupon its complete expansion in full magnitude and beauty.\r\n\r\nTo understand more clearly the cause of this rapid expansion and\r\ndevelopment of the wings, I have before explained to you that these\r\norgans, though often exceedingly thin, are always composed of two\r\nmembranes, having most commonly a number of hollow vessels, miscalled\r\nnerves, running between them[683]. These tubes, which, after the\r\nFrench Entomologists, I would name _nervures_, contribute as well\r\nto the development of the wings, as to their subsequent tension. In\r\nthe pupa, and commonly afterwards, the two membranes composing the\r\norgans in question do not touch each other's inner surface, as they\r\nafterwards do: there is consequently a space between them; and being\r\nmoist, and corrugated into a vast number of folds like those of a\r\nfan, but transverse as well as longitudinal, and so minute as to be\r\nimperceptible to the naked eye, the wings appear much thicker than\r\nin the end. Now as soon as the insect is disclosed, a fluid enters\r\nthe tubes, and being impelled into their minutest ramifications,\r\nnecessarily expands their folds; for the nervures themselves are\r\nfolded, and as they gradually extend in length with them, the moist\r\nmembranes attached to them are also unfolded and extended. In\r\nproportion as this takes place, the expanding membranes approach each\r\nother, and at last, being dried by the action of the atmosphere, become\r\none. To promote this motion of the fluid, seems the object of the\r\nagitations which the animal from time to time gives to its unexpanded\r\nwings. That a kind of circulation, or rather an injection of an aqueous\r\nfluid into these organs, actually takes place, may be ascertained by\r\na very simple experiment. If you clip the wings of a butterfly during\r\nthe process of expansion, you will see that the nervures are not only\r\nhollow, but that, however dry and empty they may subsequently be found,\r\nthey at that time actually contain such a fluid[684]. Swammerdam, who\r\nappears to have been the first physiologist that paid attention to\r\nthis subject, was of opinion that an aëriform as well as an aquiform\r\nfluid contributes to produce the effect we are considering. He had\r\nobserved that, if a small portion be cut off from the wing of a bee,\r\na fluid of the latter kind exuded from its vessels in the form of\r\npellucid globules, becoming insensibly drops--which he concluded\r\nproved the action of the latter; and he noticed, also, that the wings\r\nwere furnished with tracheæ, which were at that time distended by the\r\ninjected air; whence he justly surmised, that the action of the _air_\r\nwas also of great importance to produce the expansion of the wing[685].\r\nAnd Jurine found that every nervure contains a trachea, which,\r\nproceeding from the interior of the trunk in a serpentine direction,\r\nfollows all the ramification of the nervure, though it does not fill\r\nit[686]. Though Reaumur attributes the expansion of the wings chiefly\r\nto an _aqueous_ fluid, yet he suspects that the _air_ on some occasions\r\ncontributed to it[687].\r\n\r\nThe wings of the other tribes of insects probably differ from the\r\n_Lepidoptera_ in the manner in which they are folded. It should seem\r\nfrom Reaumur's description, that those of some flies, instead of\r\nthe straight transverse folds of the former, have angular or zigzag\r\nfolds[688]; which equally shorten the wing. Many _Hymenoptera_ have\r\nwings without any nervures except the marginal. We may conjecture that\r\nthese are more simply folded, so as to render their expansion more\r\neasy; but even in these wings there are often tracheæ, which appear as\r\nspurious nervures, and help to effect the purpose we are considering.\r\n\r\nThe operation of expanding their wings, in by far the larger number\r\nof insects, takes place gradually as described above; and, according\r\nto their size, is ended in five, ten, or fifteen minutes; in some\r\nbutterflies half an hour, in some even an hour. A few species, such\r\nas _Sphinx Œnotheræ_ F., require several hours, or even a day, for\r\nthis operation; and, from the distance to which they creep before\r\nit has taken place, a considerable degree of motion seems requisite\r\nfor causing the necessary impulse of the expanding fluids[689]. In\r\na few genera, however, as the gnat, the gnat-like Tipulidæ, and\r\nthe Ephemeræ, this process is so rapid and instantaneous, that the\r\nwings are scarcely disengaged from the wing-cases before they are\r\nfully expanded and fit for flying. These genera quit the pupa at the\r\nsurface of the water, from which, after resting upon it for a few\r\nmoments, they take flight: but this would evidently be impracticable,\r\nand immersion in the fluid, and consequent death, would result, were\r\nnot the general rule in their case deviated from.\r\n\r\nSome species of the last of these genera, _Ephemera_, are\r\ndistinguished by another peculiarity, unparalleled, as far as is\r\nknown, in the rest of the insect world. After being released from\r\nthe puparium, and making use of their expanded wings for flight,\r\noften to a considerable distance, they have yet to undergo another\r\nmetamorphosis. They fix themselves by their claws in a vertical\r\nposition upon some object, and withdraw every part of the body, even\r\nthe legs and wings, from a thin pellicle which has inclosed them,\r\nas a glove does the fingers; and so exactly do the exuviæ, which\r\nremain attached to the spot where the Ephemera disrobed itself,\r\nretain their former figure, that I have more than once at first\r\nsight mistaken them for the perfect insect. You can conceive without\r\ndifficulty how the body, and even legs, can be withdrawn from their\r\ncases; but you must be puzzled to conjecture how the wings, which\r\nseem as thin, as much expanded, and as rigid as those of a fly, can\r\nadmit of having any sheath stripped from them; much less how they\r\ncan be withdrawn, as they are, through a small opening at the base\r\nof the sheath. The fact seems to be, that though the outer covering\r\nis rigid, the wing inclosed in it, notwithstanding it is sometimes\r\nmore than twenty-four hours before the change ensues, is kept moist\r\nand pliable. In proportion, therefore, as the insect disengages\r\nitself from the anterior part of the skin, the interior or real\r\nwings become contracted by a number of plaits into a form nearly\r\ncylindrical, which readily admits of their being pulled through the\r\nopening lately mentioned; and as soon as the insect is released from\r\nits envelope, the plaits unfold, and the wing returns to its former\r\nshape and dimensions. Thus our little animal, having bid adieu to its\r\nshirt and drawers, becomes, but in a very harmless sense, a genuine\r\n_descamisado_ and _sansculotte_. It does not seem improbable, that\r\nthe pellicle we have been speaking of is analogous to that which,\r\nin addition to the outer skin, incloses the limbs of _Lepidoptera_,\r\n&c. in the pupa state, but which they cast at the same time with the\r\npuparium, and leave adhering to it[690].\r\n\r\nThe body of newly-disclosed insects commonly appears at first of its\r\nfull size; but the aphidivorous flies (_Syrphus_ F. &c.), and some\r\nothers, in about a quarter of an hour after leaving the pupa become\r\nat least twice as large as they were at their first appearance: this\r\napparent sudden growth, which is also noticed by Goedart, Reaumur\r\nfound to depend upon the expansion of the previously compressed\r\nsegments of the animal by means of the included air[691]. Both in this\r\ninstance and in that of insects whose wings only require expansion, the\r\nsize of the _imago_ often so greatly exceeds that of the _pupa_, that\r\nwe can scarcely believe our eyes that it should have been included in\r\nso contracted a space. The pupa of one of the beautiful lace-winged\r\nflies (_Hemerobius Perla_) is not so big as a small pea, yet the body\r\nof the fly is nearly half an inch long, and covers, when its wings and\r\nantennæ are expanded, a surface of an inch square[692].\r\n\r\nWhen the development of the perfect insect is complete, and all\r\nits parts and organs have attained the requisite firmness and\r\nsolidity[693], it immediately begins to exercise them in their\r\nintended functions; it walks, runs, or flies in search of food; or\r\nof the other sex of its own species, if it be a male, that it may\r\nfulfill the great end of its existence in this state--the propagation\r\nof its kind. Previously to thus launching into the wide world, or at\r\nleast immediately afterwards, almost all insects discharge from their\r\nintestines some drops of an excrementitious fluid, often transparent,\r\nand sometimes red. I have before related to you the alarm that this\r\nlast circumstance has now and then produced on the minds of the\r\nignorant and superstitious[694]. Whether this excrement is produced\r\nindifferently both by males and females I cannot positively assert;\r\nbut a circumstance related by Jurine affords some ground for a\r\nsuspicion that it is peculiar to the latter. A specimen of a female\r\nof _Lasiocampa Rubi_, when killed emitted some of this fluid, which\r\ndropped upon the floor: this appeared to attract the males to the\r\napartment in which it happened, and to the very spot--from whence it\r\nmay be conjectured, that the scent of the fluid brought them there,\r\nand that the use of it is to bring the sexes together soon after\r\nexclusion from the pupa[695].\r\n\r\nThe colour, sculpture, and other peculiarities which distinguish\r\ninsects in this state I shall consider at large in another letter,\r\nwhen I treat of their external parts and organs. Under the present\r\nhead I shall confine myself to pointing out the characters by which\r\nthe _sexes_ of many species are distinguished from each other;\r\nas likewise the _duration of their life_ in their perfect state;\r\ntogether with the circumstances on which this duration depends.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Sexual Distinctions._ The first general rule that may be laid down\r\nunder this section is,--That among insects, contrary to what mostly\r\noccurs in vertebrate animals, the _size_ of the female is almost\r\nconstantly larger than that of the male. Even in the larva and pupa\r\nstates, a practised eye can judge, from their greater size, which\r\nindividuals will become females. There are, however, some exceptions\r\nto this rule. Thus amongst the _Coleoptera_, the male _Dynastidæ_,\r\nremarkable for their horns, as you may see in _D. Alocus_, _Antæus_,\r\n_Actæon_, &c., as likewise those of _Lucanus_, are larger than the\r\nunarmed females[696]. In the _Neuroptera_ the female _Libellulidæ_ are\r\nsometimes sensibly smaller, and never larger, than their males[697]. In\r\nthe _Hymenoptera_ the male of the hive-bee, but more particularly that\r\nof _Anthidium manicatum_ and other bees of that genus, is much more\r\nrobust than the other sex[698]. In the _Diptera_, the same difference\r\nis observable in _Syrphus Ribesii_, and some other aphidivorous\r\nflies, and also in _Scatophaga stercoraria_[699]. And amongst the\r\n_apterous_ tribes, we are informed by De Geer that the male of\r\n_Argyroneta aquatica_, which builds an aërial palace in the bosom of\r\nthe waters[700], usually exceeds the female in bulk[701]. The reason of\r\nthis rule seems in some degree connected with the office of the female\r\nas a mother, that sufficient space may be allowed for the vast number\r\nof eggs she is destined to produce; and it is when impregnation has\r\ntaken place, and the eggs are ready for extrusion, that the difference\r\nis most sensible. In the majority of cases this sexual disproportion\r\nis not very considerable, but in some few it is enormous. Reaumur\r\nmentions a beetle, of which he intended to give the history, the male\r\nof which is so small compared with the female, that a bull not bigger\r\nthan a sheep, or even a hare, set by the side of the largest cow, would\r\naptly contrast with them. This little beetle, he says, has wings and\r\nelytra, while the giant female has no vestige of either, having the\r\nupper surface of its body naked and membranous[702]. The species to\r\nwhich this illustrious Naturalist here alludes, does not appear to\r\nhave been ascertained. The female of many gall-insects (_Cocci_) is so\r\nlarge in comparison with the male, that the latter traverses her back\r\nas an ample area for a walk[703]. But this is nothing compared with\r\nthe prodigious difference between the sexes of _Termes fatale_, and\r\nother species of white ants, whose males are often many thousand times\r\nless than the females, when the latter are distended with eggs[704].\r\nAccidental differences in the size of the sexes sometimes arise: as\r\nwhen the female larva has, from any cause, been deprived of its proper\r\nsupply of food, it will occasionally be less than the male. De Geer\r\nhas stated a circumstance with respect to the _Aphides_ that produce\r\ngalls, that should be mentioned under this head--the first, or _mother_\r\nfemale, is larger than any of her progeny ever become[705].\r\n\r\nThe second observation that may be generally applied to the sexes of\r\ninsects is, that, size excepted, there is a close resemblance between\r\nthem in other respects. But to this rule the exceptions are very\r\nnumerous, and so important that it is necessary to specify examples\r\nof each under distinct heads.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. In some species the sexes are either partly or wholly of a\r\ndifferent _colour_. Thus, in the order _Coleoptera_, the elytra of\r\nthe male of _Rhagium meridianum_ F. are testaceous, and those of the\r\nfemale black. _Leptura rubra_ of Linné, with red elytra, is the\r\nfemale of his _L. testacea_, in which they are testaceous. _Cantharis\r\ndermestoides_ of the same author is the other sex of his _Meloe\r\nMarci_; one of which is chiefly testaceous, and the other black:\r\nwhich seems to have so misled Linné, that he placed them in different\r\ngenera. One more instance in this order, the female of _Cicindela\r\ncampestris_, as was first observed to me by our friend Sheppard, has\r\na black dot on each elytrum, not far from its base near the suture,\r\nwhich the male has not.\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Orthoptera_, the male _Locustæ_ F., as Professor\r\nLichtenstein has informed us[706], have a fenestrated ocellus, which\r\nis not to be found in the other sex. I was once attending to the\r\nproceedings of a Hemipterous species, _Pentatoma oleracea_ Latr.,\r\nwhich I found in union: the paired insects had white spots, but\r\nanother individual was standing by them, in which the spots were\r\nof a sanguine hue. I mention this by the way only--the spots in\r\nthe prolific sexes being of the same colour: but might not the red\r\nspotted one be a neuter?\r\n\r\nThe sexes of many _Lepidoptera_ likewise differ in their colour. I\r\nmust single out a few from a great number of instances. The males of\r\n_Lycæna Argus_ F. have the upper surface of their anterior wings of a\r\ndark blue, while in the female it is wholly brown. The wings of the\r\nformer sex of _Hypogymna dispar_ are gray, clouded with brown; but\r\nthose of the latter are white, with black spots. In the brimstone\r\nbutterfly (_Colias Rhamni_), which is one of the first that appear in\r\nthe spring, the wings of the male are yellow--of the female whitish.\r\nIn the common orange-tip (_Pieris Cardamines_ F.), one sex has not\r\nthe orange tip to the upper wings: and, to name no more, the male of\r\n_Lycæna dispar_, one of our rarest and most beautiful butterflies,\r\nhas only a single black spot in the disk of its fulgid wings; while\r\nin the other sex, the primary pair have nine, and the secondary are\r\nblack, with a transverse orange fascia near the posterior margin.\r\nBut the most remarkable difference in this respect observable in the\r\ninsects of the order in question, takes place in a tribe, of which\r\nonly one species is certainly known to inhabit Britain--I mean the\r\n_Papiliones Equites_ of Linné: what he has called his _Trojani_ and\r\n_Achivi_ in some instances have proved only different sexes of the\r\nsame species. Mr. MacLeay's rich cabinet affords a singular instance\r\nconfirming this assertion;--a specimen of a Papilio is divided\r\nlongitudinally, the right hand side being male, and the left hand\r\nfemale. The former belongs to _P. Polycaon_, a Grecian, the latter to\r\n_P. Laodocus_, a Trojan. An instance of two _Grecians_ thus united is\r\nrecorded in the _Encyclopédie Méthodique_, as exhibited in a specimen\r\npreserved in the Museum of Natural History at Paris; which on the\r\nright hand side is _P. Ulysses_, on the left _P. Diomedes_[707].\r\n\r\nIn the _Neuroptera_, the _Libellulidæ_ are remarkable for the\r\ndifferences of colour in the sexes. In the common _Libellula\r\ndepressa_, which you may see hawking over every pool, the abdomen\r\nof the male is usually slate-colour, while that of his partner is\r\nyellow, but with darker side-spots. Reaumur, however, noticed some\r\nmales that were of the same colour with the females[708]. Schelver\r\nobserved, when he put the skins of _Libellula depressa_ into water,\r\nthat the colours common to both sexes were in the substance of the\r\nskin, and remained fixed; while those that were peculiar to one\r\ncould be taken off with a hair-pencil, and coloured the water: which\r\ntherefore were superficial, and, as it were, laid on[709]. The yellow\r\nmales, therefore, that Reaumur observed, were probably such as had\r\nthe superficial blue colour which distinguishes them washed off. In\r\n_Calepteryx Virgo_ Leach, the former are of a lovely silky blue, and\r\nthe latter green. In _Agrions_ F. nature sports infinitely in the\r\ncolours of the sexes.\r\n\r\nIn the order _Hymenoptera_ there are often differences equally great;\r\nthe sexes of many of the Ichneumons and Saw-flies are of quite\r\ndifferent colours. The former tribe Linné has divided into sections,\r\nfrom the white annulus observable in the antennæ of some, and from\r\nthe colour of their scutellum: but these are often merely sexual\r\ncharacters[710]. The male of _Anthophora retusa_ Latr., a kind of\r\nwild bee, is wholly black, the female wholly gray, and of so very\r\ndifferent an aspect that they were long regarded as distinct species;\r\na mistake which has likewise occurred with regard to the sexes of\r\n_Osmia cærulescens_, another bee, of which the male has a bronzed and\r\nthe female a violet abdomen[711]. The nose of male _Andrenæ_ Latr.\r\nis often yellow, or white, as in _A. hæmorrhoidalis_--when that of\r\nthe female is black[712]. The _labrum_ also is often of a different\r\ncolour in the sexes, as in _Ceratina_ Latr.\r\n\r\nIn the _Diptera_, _Aptera_, _Arachnida_, &c., I am not aware of any\r\nstriking difference in the colours of the sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. The sexes of insects vary (but more rarely than in colour) in\r\ntheir _sculpture_ also, and _pubescence_. Thus the elytra of the\r\nfemales of many of the larger water-beetles (_Dytiscus_) are deeply\r\nfurrowed, while those of the males are quite smooth and level[713].\r\nThe thorax of the female in several species of _Colymbetes_ of the\r\nsame tribe, as _C. Hybneri_ and _transversalis_, on each side has\r\nseveral tortuous impressed lines or scratches, like net-work, which\r\nare not to be discovered in the male. _Hyphydrus gibbus_ Latr.,\r\nwhich differs solely from _H. ovalis_ (_Dytiscus ovalis_ Illig.) in\r\nbeing thickly covered with minute impressed puncta, is, from the\r\nobservation of the Rev. R. Sheppard, the other sex of this last,\r\nwith which he has taken it coupled; and it is by no means improbable\r\nthat _Hydroporus picipes_ (_Dytiscus punctatus_ Marsh.) and _H.\r\nlineatus_,--between which, as Gyllenhal has justly observed, the same\r\ndifference only exists,--are in like manner sexual varieties. With\r\nrespect to _pubescence_, I have not much to say. Another aquatic\r\nbeetle, _Acilius sulcatus_ Leach, has not only its elytra sulcated,\r\nbut the furrows of these, and a transverse one of the thorax, are\r\nthickly set with hair; while the male is smooth, and quite naked.\r\nParticular care seems to have been taken by the Creator, that when\r\nall the above inhabitants of the water are paired, the male should be\r\nable to fix himself so firmly, by means of his remarkable anterior\r\ntarsi, (which I shall afterwards describe,) and these asperities,\r\n&c. in the upper surface of his mate, as not to be displaced by the\r\nfluctuations of that element, the reluctance of the coy female, or\r\nany other slighter cause.\r\n\r\nIn a moth called the ghost (_Hepialus Humuli_), the posterior tibia\r\nof the male is densely bearded, but not of the female[714].--Some\r\n_Hymenoptera_, as _Ammophila_ Kirb. and _Stigmus_ Jurine, have\r\nthe upper lip of the male clothed with silver pile, while that\r\nof the female is not so ornamented. The legs of some bees are\r\ndistinguished in the sexes by a difference in their _clothing_. That\r\nobservable in those of the hive-bee has been before noticed[715].\r\nIn _Andrena_ of Latreille[716] the posterior tibia of the female is\r\ncovered externally with a dense brush of hairs, for collecting the\r\npollen; and the posterior legs at their base have a curled lock of\r\nhair--which are not to be found in the male[717]. In _Dasypoda_,\r\n_Melecta_, _Anthophora_, _Centris_, _Epicharis_, &c. of the same\r\nauthor, the first joint of the tarsus of the female, and in\r\n_Xylocopa_ almost the whole tarsus, is also similarly signalized from\r\nthat of the other sex. In _Bombus_, as in the hive-bee, the posterior\r\ntibiæ of the females and neuters are furnished with a basket of hairs\r\nfor carrying their pollen paste, which you will in vain look for in\r\nthe male[718]. The latter, however, in some species of this tribe are\r\ndistinguished from the former by the longer hairs of their legs, but\r\nnot in the posterior ones. Thus, in _Anthophora retusa_ the first\r\njoints of the intermediate tarsus are bearded internally with a thin\r\nfringe of long hairs, and the first externally with a triangular one\r\nof short ones at the apex: but what is most remarkable, the last or\r\nunguicular joint, which in almost every other bee is naked, is on\r\nboth sides fringed with long hairs[719]. In that remarkable genus\r\n_Acanthopus_ Illig., of which the male only is known, the first and\r\nlast joint of the intermediate tarsus have a dense external brush\r\nof stiff hairs, which probably is also a sexual character[720].\r\nAnother sexual kind of clothing is exhibited by the females of those\r\nbees that have their labrum or upper-lip inflexed (_Megachile_\r\nLatr.)[721]. Their abdomen is covered underneath with a brush of\r\nstiff hairs, involved in which they carry the pollen they collect.\r\nIn the males of some of this tribe, as of _M. Willughbiella_, the\r\nfirst four joints of the anterior tarsus on their inner side have a\r\nlong dense fringe of incurved hairs[722]: a circumstance also to be\r\nfound in the same sex of _Xylocopa latipes_, in which the claw-joint\r\nalso is bearded[723]. In _Andrena_ Latr. the last dorsal segment of\r\nthe abdomen of the same sex is fringed, while that of the male is\r\nnaked[724]. In the humble-bees (_Bombus_), the mandibles of the male\r\nare bearded with curled hairs, while those of the females and neuters\r\nare without them. Some bees, as _Andrena_ and _Halictus_ Latr., have\r\nthe anus of the female bearded, and that of the male naked: in some\r\n_Bombyces_ the reverse takes place.\r\n\r\niii. With regard to the general _shape_ of their body, the male and\r\nfemale usually resemble each other: but there are some exceptions to\r\nthis rule. The male of the hive-bee is much thicker and more clumsy\r\nthan either the female or the worker; but in _Halictus_ Latr. the\r\nmales are nearly cylindrical in shape, and very narrow; while the\r\nother sex are oblong or ovate, especially their abdomen: and in\r\n_Andrena_ Latr. the former are much slenderer than the females, and\r\nof a more lanceolate shape. But a still more striking difference\r\nin this respect between the sexes is exhibited by some species of\r\nthe genus _Ptinus_ F., in which the male is long and slender, and\r\nthe female short and thick. This, in more than one instance, has\r\noccasioned them to be mistaken for distinct insects: thus, _P.\r\nLichenum_ and _P. similis_, _P. ovatus_ and _P. testaceus_, of Mr.\r\nMarsham, are mere sexual varieties. But the most entire abalienation\r\nof shape at present known, is that which distinguishes the male from\r\nthe female _Coccus_; these are so completely dissimilar as scarcely\r\nto have any part in common. In _Bombyx vestita_ F., and others of\r\nthe same family, while the males are of the ordinary conformation of\r\nthe order, the females are without even the slightest rudiments of\r\nwings; they have no antennæ, the legs are extremely short, not longer\r\nthan those of the caterpillar; and the body is entirely destitute\r\nof scales, so that they altogether assume the exact appearance of\r\nhexapod larvæ[725]. A conformation nearly similar takes place in the\r\nfemale of _Tinea Lichenella_; but in this the feet are longer, and\r\nthe anus is furnished with a long retractile ovipositor[726].\r\n\r\niv. In many cases, the structure of particular _parts_ and _organs_\r\nof the body differs in the sexes. As the facts connected with this\r\npart of our present subject are extremely numerous and various,\r\nit will be convenient to subdivide it, and consider the sexual\r\ncharacters that distinguish--the _Head_, _Trunk_, and _Abdomen_ of\r\ninsects, and their several appendages.\r\n\r\n1. The _Head_. This part in some females is considerably larger than\r\nit is in the male. This is the case with the ants, and several other\r\n_Hymenoptera_; while in some _Andrenæ_, as _A. hæmorrhoidalis_, and\r\n_Staphylinidæ_, as _St. olens_, that of the male is the largest. But\r\nin none is the difference more conspicuous than in the stag-beetle\r\n(_Lucanus_); in which genus the male not only exceeds the female\r\nin the length of his mandibles, but also greatly in the size and\r\ndimensions of his head. In the _Apion_ genus, the rostrum of the\r\nfemale is generally longer and slenderer than that of her mate; and\r\nin _Brentus_, the rostrum of one sex (probably the male) is long\r\nand filiform, while in the other it is thick and short. This is\r\nparticularly visible in _B. dispar_ and _maxillosus_[727], &c.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking distinctions of the males in this part of\r\ntheir body, are those threatening horns, usually hollow, with which\r\nthe heads of many of the male lamellicorn insects and some others\r\nare armed, and which give them some resemblance to many of the\r\nlarger quadrupeds. Many are _unicorns_, and have their head armed\r\nwith only a _single_ horn; which in some, as in _Oryctes_ Illig.,\r\n_Dynastes Endymion_[728], &c. is very short; in others, very long,\r\nas in _Dynastes Enema_, _Pan_, _Elephas_[729]. In one, again, it\r\nis thick and robust; as in the clumsy _Dynastes Actæon_[730]: in\r\nanother very slender, as in _Onthophagus spinifer_[731]. With respect\r\nto its direction in _Elephastomus proboscideus_ MacLeay, it is\r\nhorizontal[732] and straight; in _Phaleria cornuta_ horizontal and\r\nbroken, or the apex turning outwards and forming an angle with the\r\nbase[733]; in _Dynastes Hercules_ horizontal, and recurved at the\r\napex[734]; in _D. Actæon_, _Elephas_, and _Typhon_, recurving from\r\nthe base. In _Geotrupes dispar_ it is recurved, so that its point\r\nexactly coincides with that of the porrected thoracic horn, with\r\nwhich it forms a kind of forceps[735]. In _Copris lunaris_ F. and\r\n_Diaperis horrida_, the horn is nearly upright[736]. In _Onthophagus\r\nXiphias_ it is dilated at the base, and reclining upon the thorax;\r\nand at the apex attenuated, and bending forwards, or nodding.\r\nIn _Passalus cornutus_ it rises a little, and then bends wholly\r\nforwards. In _Dynastes Milon_, a most remarkable beetle, it slopes\r\nbackwards in a waving line[737]; and in _Onthophagus spinifer_ it is\r\nrecurved and reclining.--In speaking of the direction of the horn,\r\nyou must recollect that it will vary in proportion as the head varies\r\nfrom a horizontal position: so that an upright horn will become\r\ninclined or reclined, as the head bends forwards or backwards; but\r\nI speak of it as it appears when the head is horizontal. Again,\r\nit varies in its teeth or branches. In _Dynastes Hercules_ it is\r\narmed with several teeth. In _D. Elephas_ and _Actæon_ it has only\r\none large one at its upper base[738]. In _D. Milon_ it is serrated\r\nabove. In _D. Alcides_, _Tityus_, _Ægeon_, _Copris lunaris_, &c. the\r\nhorn is unarmed and simple at the apex. In _D. Oromedon_, _Gedeon_,\r\n_Enema_, _Actæon_ and congeners, it is bifid. In some the horn is at\r\nfirst a broad lamina or ridge, which terminates in two branches, as\r\nin _Onthophagus Vacca_. In this the branches are straight; but in\r\nanother undescribed species in my cabinet (_O. Aries_ Kirby, MS.)\r\nthey are first bent inwards, and then at the apex a little recurved:\r\nand in _D. dichotomus_ it is divided into two short branches, each of\r\nwhich is bifid[739]. Other males emulate the bull, the he-goat, or\r\nthe stag, in having a _pair_ of horns on their head. In _Onthophagus\r\nTaurus_, these arms in their curvature exactly resemble those of\r\nthe first of these animals[740]. In _Goliathus pulverulentus_, the\r\nstraight, robust, diverging, sharp horns are not unlike those of some\r\nof the goat or gazel tribe. I have a beautiful little specimen in my\r\ncabinet, (I believe collected by Mr. Abbott of Georgia,) in which the\r\nhorns have a lateral tooth, or short branch, like those of a stag;\r\nand which I have therefore named _O. cervicornis_. In _O. Vacca_,\r\n_Camelus_, &c. the horns are very short, and nearly perpendicular. In\r\nthe male of _Copris Midas_, the two longer perpendicular horns have\r\na deep cavity between them, which, together with its black colour,\r\ngive it a most demoniac aspect; so that you would think it more aptly\r\nrepresentative of a Beelzebub or _Beelzebul_ than a Midas[741],\r\nor than _Phanæus Beelzebul_ MacL. A similar cavity is between the\r\noccipital horns of _Diaperis hæmorrhoidalis_ Payk. Some species of\r\n_Rynchænus_, as _R. Taurus_, have a pair of long horns upon the\r\nrostrum of the male, the rudiments only of which are to be traced\r\nin the female[742]. Other species go beyond any known quadrupeds in\r\nthe number of horns that arm their heads. Thus _Ditomus calydonius_\r\nBonelli, belonging to _Carabus_ L., has _three_ equal horns[743]. The\r\nsame number distinguishes _Onthophagus Bonasus_; but the intermediate\r\none is very short. In _Goliathus Polyphemus_ the middle horn, on\r\nthe contrary, is much longer and thicker than the lateral ones, and\r\nforked at the apex; so that it looks as if it had four of these\r\nweapons[744]. A little _Diaperis_ (_D. viridipennis_ F.), a native\r\nof _Carolina_, has four horns upon the head of the male; namely,\r\ntwo long ones on the occiput, and two short dentiform ones on the\r\nnose. In a species nearly related to this, sent me by Professor Peck\r\nfrom New England, there is a cavity between the two occipital horns.\r\nThe same number distinguishes _Onthophagus quadricornis_ (_Copris_\r\nF.). The _situation_ also of the horns varies: In some it is in the\r\n_middle_ of the head, as _Oryctes nasicornis_, _Copris lunaris_,\r\n&c.: in others, as in _Onthophagus nuchicornis_, _Xiphias_, &c. it\r\nis a process of the _occiput_ or hind-head; and in _O. Oryx_ F. the\r\ntwo horns proceed from the _anterior_ part of the head. In the other\r\nsex, in insects the head of whose males is armed with horns, they are\r\nusually replaced by mere tubercles, or very short elevations, as you\r\nmay see in the female of _Copris lunaris_; or by transverse ridges,\r\nas in the _Onthophagi_: or else the head is without arms, and quite\r\nsmooth, as in _Diaperis_, _Phaleria_, &c. What may be the use of\r\nthese extraordinary appendages, as well as those on the thorax, and\r\nin some cases on the abdomen, (which I shall mention afterwards), to\r\nthe males, has not yet been ascertained. Whether the individuals of\r\nthis sex are more exposed to the attack of birds and other enemies,\r\nin consequence of being more on the wing than the females, and are\r\ntherefore thus provided with numerous projecting points for defence,\r\nis a question worth considering[745]. It is the only probable\r\nconjecture on the _cui bono_ of these arms that I can at present\r\nmake. Under this head I ought to notice the remarkable membranous\r\nprocess of an obovate shape, which like an umbrella covers the head\r\nof _Acheta umbraculata_ F.[746] Whether the sharp curved horns which\r\narm this part in another _Acheta_ figured by Stoll[747], in an\r\nincumbent posture, with their point towards the mouth, are a sexual\r\ndistinction, we are not informed,--probably they are.\r\n\r\nThe _organs_ of the head also present many sexual distinctions.\r\nThe upper lip (_labrum_) in _Halictus_ Latr., a tribe of wild bees,\r\nin the female is furnished with an inflexed appendage, which is not\r\ndiscoverable in that of the male[748]; and the shape of this lip in\r\n_Sphecodes_ Latr. differs in the sexes[749]. Perhaps the horn or\r\ntubercle observable on this part of some female _Nomadæ_ F.[750] may\r\nbe wanting in the male.\r\n\r\nThe under-lip (_labium_)--taken in a restricted sense for that\r\ncentral part from which emerge the labial palpi, and which is often\r\nconsidered as the mentum,--does not offer any striking variations in\r\nthe sexes. One, however, is of importance, as it helps to prove which\r\nare the true female _Lucani_. In the male the labium is emarginate,\r\nin the female it is intire. This may be seen both in _L. Cervus_\r\nand _femoratus_, and probably in other species. The sculpture also\r\nis different, the lip being smooth in the former and covered with\r\nexcavated _puncta_ in the latter. The tongue (_lingua_ or _ligula_)\r\nof the sexes is usually the same; except in the hive-bee, in which\r\nthat of the neuters is longer than that of the male and female.\r\n\r\nThe upper-jaws (_mandibulæ_), however, often afford striking sexual\r\ncharacters. The enormous protended ones of the common stag-beetle\r\n(_Lucanus Cervus_) attract the attention of the most incurious\r\nobserver; and these are now generally allowed to be of this\r\ndescription. Geoffroy and Mr. Marsham, indeed, have asserted that\r\nthey have taken _in coitu_ those with long mandibles: but as these\r\nmales are pugnacious, and attack each other with great fury, as Mr.\r\nSheppard informs me, it is not improbable that these gentlemen may\r\nhave mistaken a _battle_ for an _amour_: since not only have those\r\nwith long mandibles been often taken united with those that have short\r\nones[751], but the same difference obtains in the sexes of other\r\nspecies. This is particularly observable in _Lucanus femoratus_, of\r\nwhich I received from Brazil many specimens agreeing in every respect\r\nexcept in this, that one had short and the other very long mandibles.\r\nThese organs vary in different specimens, as to the number of their\r\nteeth and branches. They are singularly robust in _L. Alces_[752]; but\r\nin none more threatening than in _L. Elephas_[753], in which they curve\r\noutwards and downwards. In Mr. W. MacLeay's genus _Pholidotus_, they\r\nare almost parallel to each other, and curve downwards; in _Lucanus\r\nnebulosus_ Kirby, they assume a contrary direction[754]; as they do\r\nlikewise in _Lamprima_ Latr.[755] In _Lucanus Capreolus_ the points\r\nclose over each other[756]. In _Lethrus_ F. in the female, but not\r\nthe male, the mandible is armed below with a long incurved horn. In\r\n_Lucanus serricornis_ they form a complete forceps[757]. In _Siagonium\r\nquadricorne_ Kirby[758] the mandible is furnished at its base with an\r\nexterior horn, which is probably a sexual distinction. The male of\r\n_Synagris cornuta_, a kind of wasp, is still more conspicuous in this\r\nrespect; for from the upper side of the base of its straight slender\r\nmandibles proceed a pair of crooked, decurved, tortuous, sharp horns,\r\nnot only longer than the mandible, but than the head itself[759].\r\nMany sexual differences are observable in the mandibles of the various\r\ntribes of bees (_Anthophila_ Latr.). Thus, in _Colletes_ Latr. the\r\n_male_ mandible is more distinctly bidentate at the apex than the\r\nfemale[760]: in _Sphecodes_ Latr. and others, the reverse of this takes\r\nplace[761]. Where these organs in both sexes are toothed at the apex,\r\nthey often vary in the number of teeth. Thus, the female of _Megachile\r\ncentuncularis_ Latr. has four teeth at the apex of its mandible, while\r\nthe male has only two[762]. In _M. Willughbiella_, though the mandibles\r\nof both sexes have four teeth, yet those of the male are sharp, and\r\nthe two external ones the longest; while those of his mate are obtuse,\r\nand all nearly equal in length[763]. In _Anthidium manicatum_ Latr.,\r\nthe former has only three teeth, while the latter has five[764].\r\nThe differences in this respect in the hive-bee have been before\r\nnoticed[765]; those of the humble-bees (_Bombus_ Latr.) are strikingly\r\ndistinguished from each other; the female mandible being very stout and\r\nwide, constricted in the middle, and furrowed on its outer surface; and\r\nthe male, on the contrary, very slender at the apex, dilated at the\r\nbase, and without furrows[766].\r\n\r\nOf all the organs of the head, none seem so little subject to _sexual_\r\nvariation as the under-jaws (_maxillæ_)[767]. I can bring forward only\r\none striking instance of it, and some degree of doubt rests even upon\r\nthat. In the genus _Nemognatha_ of Illiger, the maxillæ of the male are\r\nelongated, narrow, setiform, and often involute or spiral, like those\r\nof a bee or a butterfly. But that this is peculiar to the males is at\r\npresent only surmised[768]. I possess several species of the genus, all\r\nof which are distinguished by long maxillæ; though in some they are as\r\nlong as the body, and in others scarcely half that length. _Gnathium_\r\nKirby is similarly characterized[769].\r\n\r\nThe _maxillary palpi_ occasionally differ in the sexes. In _Cerocoma_\r\nthose of the female are filiform, while the two intermediate joints\r\nof those of the other sex are much thicker than the first and\r\nthe last[770]. In _Hylæcetus_ and _Lymexylon_, those of the male\r\nare still more remarkable: they are pendent, the last joint very\r\nlarge, and laciniated so as to form a tuft[771]. The female ones\r\ngrow gradually larger towards the end, but are not at all divided\r\nthere[772]. The palpi of male spiders are of a very different\r\nstructure from those of the other sex, terminating in a very complex\r\nincrassated piece, which has been supposed to contain the organ\r\nof generation; but this, according to Treviranus, is a mistaken\r\nidea--that organ being, as usual, to be found in the abdomen[773]. In\r\nthe common gnat the palpi of the male are as long as the proboscis,\r\nconsist of five joints, and at the end are tufted with hairs; while\r\nthose of the female are scarcely one-fourth of its length, have only\r\nthree joints, and are not tufted. Whether the _labial palpi_ in any\r\ngenus differ in the sexes, I cannot affirm with certainty: I have\r\nnot, however, observed any such variation in them.\r\n\r\nI shall next mention some organs of the head, in which the difference\r\nbetween the sexes is often very striking and peculiar. You will\r\nreadily conjecture that I am speaking of the _antennæ_. And here\r\nthe advantage seems wholly on the side of the males: since in them\r\nthese wonderful instruments of unknown sensations are not only more\r\ncomplex, but usually more elegant, than those of the other sex. You\r\nwill pardon me, therefore, if I enlarge a little more than ordinary\r\nupon a subject so full of interest, and say something upon the\r\ndifferences observable between the sexes--in the shape, magnitude,\r\nand length, number of articulations, ramification and plumage, and\r\nindividual joints of their antennæ.\r\n\r\nWith regard to their _shape_, variations are sometimes observable\r\nbetween the antennæ of the sexes; but this principally occurs in the\r\n_Hymenoptera_ order. For instance, those of _Chelostoma maxillosa_,\r\na small bee that deposits its eggs in little holes in posts and\r\nrails, are clavate in the female and filiform in the male[774]--a\r\ncircumstance that distinguishes in some degree those of _Sphecodes_,\r\n_Halictus_, and _Andrena_ of Latreille, three other genera of\r\nwild-bees[775]. In _Dinetus_ Jur. the male antennæ are moniliform at\r\nthe base, and filiform at the apex; the female, on the contrary, are\r\nentirely filiform[776].\r\n\r\nThe antennæ of the sexes also sometimes differ in _magnitude_ and\r\n_length_. This is the case in the three genera of wild bees just\r\nmentioned; those of the female being thicker than those of the male,\r\nwhile these last are longer than the former. But in this tribe\r\nthe males of the Fabrician genus _Eucera_ are most remarkable for\r\ntheir long antennæ[777]. With regard to the different length of\r\nthese organs in the sexes, no insects are more distinguished than\r\nsome species of the capricorn-beetles (_Cerambyx_ L.). In _Lamia\r\nSutor_ the male antennæ are twice the length of the female; and in\r\nanother Brazilian species in my cabinet, related to _L. annulata_\r\n(_Stenocorus_ F.), they are thrice their length. Some of the\r\n_Anthribi_ F. approach the _Cerambycidæ_, not only in some other\r\ncharacters, but also in this circumstance:--thus the antennæ of _A.\r\nalbinus_, a native of Britain, are vastly longer in the male than in\r\nthe female; and in _A. cinereus_ (_Macrocephalus_ Oliv.)[778], which\r\nI suspect to be of the former sex, they are as long nearly as is\r\nusual in the tribe just named, called in France capricorn-beetles.\r\n\r\nI may here observe, that sometimes in the sexes a difference is also\r\nto be found in the _direction_ or flexure of their antennæ. Thus in\r\n_Scolia_ F., _Pepsis_ F. &c., in the males the antennæ are nearly\r\nstraight, but in the females convolute or subspiral. The reverse\r\nof this takes place in _Epipone spinipes_, a kind of wasp, and its\r\naffinities; and _Systropha_ Illig., a kind of bee: for in these the\r\nmale antenna is convolute at the apex[779], and the female straight.\r\nIn the various tribes of bees (_Anthophila_ Latr.), these organs in\r\nthe latter are what is denominated _broken_, the main body of the\r\nantenna forming an angle with the first joints: but in the former\r\nthis does not take place.\r\n\r\nThe antennas of the sexes do not always agree in the _number_ of\r\njoints. In the bees, and many other _Hymenoptera_, the male has\r\none more joint than the female; as is the case also in _Œdemera\r\nnotata_ (_Cantharis acuta_ Marsh.). In _Pteronus Laricis_, a kind of\r\nsaw-fly, the latter has only sixteen joints in its antennæ, while the\r\nformer has twenty-four[780]. In _Rhipicera marginata_, a beetle, the\r\nbeautiful antennæ of the male consist of thirty-two joints, while the\r\nfemale has no more than eleven! In _Chelonus_ Jur. the male, on the\r\ncontrary, has the smallest number of joints, namely sixteen; while\r\nthe female has twenty-five[781].\r\n\r\nIn nothing do the sexes differ more materially than in the\r\n_ramification_ of these organs, and their _plumage_. By attending\r\nto this, you may often detect the sexes in an instant; since the\r\nantennæ of the males in numerous instances are much more complex than\r\nthose of the females. For what end the Creator has so distinguished\r\nthem is not quite clear; but most probably this complex structure\r\nis for the purpose of receiving from the atmosphere information of\r\nthe station of the female. A tendency to branching will be found in\r\nthe antennæ of some males, in tribes where these organs are usually\r\nperfectly simple in both sexes. Thus, in the male of _Chelostoma\r\nmaxillosa_,--mistaken for another species by Linné, which he names\r\n_Apis florisomnis_,--the intermediate joints on their inner side\r\nproject into an angle[782]; and those of the same sex of the common\r\nhornet, by means of a central sinus, have two obtuse teeth on each.\r\nWith regard to more direct ramifications, some male antennæ terminate\r\nin a fork, or two branches. This is the case with _Hylotoma furcata_\r\nLatr., a saw-fly[783]; and the peacock-louse (_Nirmus Pavonis_\r\nHerm.)[784]. Others, again, have three lateral branches, as in\r\n_Eulophus_ Geoffr. a little parasite, the male antennæ of which send\r\nforth a hairy external and rather long branch, from the base of the\r\nfourth, fifth, and sixth joints[785]. In _Elater flabellicornis_\r\nL., the eight last joints are flabellate, or elongated and flat,\r\nresembling the sticks of a fan in the male[786]; in the female they\r\nare shorter, and more properly may take their denomination from the\r\nteeth of a comb. In _Lampyris Latreillii_ Kirby, the antennæ of the\r\nformer are flabellate on both sides, while those of the latter are\r\nlittle more than serrate[787]. These organs are extremely beautiful\r\nin the males of the _Rhipiceræ_ of Latreille. In _R. marginata_ K.\r\nthey consist of thirty-two joints, from thirty of which issues a\r\nbranch, the first very short, but the rest gradually increasing in\r\nlength as they approach the middle of the antenna; then gradually\r\ndecreasing to the end, so as to represent an expanded fan[788]. But\r\nin none are they altogether so remarkable as in those moths that\r\nLinné denominates _Bombyces Attaci_, and some others. In these, in\r\nthe males, these organs in their contour are lanceolate, and every\r\njoint is furnished with a couple of parallel equal branches on each\r\nside[789]. In the females these branches are shorter on the whole,\r\nand alternately one long and one short; but in some, as _Saturnia\r\nPavonia_, there is only one short branch or tooth on each joint in\r\nthis sex[790]. In _Bombyx regalis_ &c. only the first part of the\r\nantenna is so branched; and those of the female are setaceous and\r\nwithout branches. In _B. versicolor_, &c. there is only one branch\r\nfrom each side on every joint; those of the female being much shorter\r\nthan those of the male. The latter sex of _Pteronus Laricis_ Jur., a\r\nsaw-fly, afford an example of a different structure, the antennæ on\r\none side sending forth a branch from every joint but the two first;\r\nbut on the other side, the nine or ten last joints also are without\r\na branch. The female antenna is serrated[791]. In another of this\r\ntribe, _Pterygopterus cinctus_ Klug, the male antenna resembles a\r\nsingle-toothed comb, being branched only on one side: that of the\r\nfemale, like the former instance, is serrated[792]. Whether the\r\nremarkable antennæ that distinguish the known individuals of the\r\ngenus _Phengodes_ (_Lampyris plumosa_ F.) is a sexual character\r\nhas not been ascertained; but it is not improbable that it may be,\r\nas in other _Lampyridæ_. A pair of delicate flexile and almost\r\nconvolute plumose branches proceeds from the apex of each joint\r\nexcept the basal ones, which have something the air of cirri, and\r\ngive a more than usual degree of lightness and elegance to these\r\norgans[793]. Other antennæ, especially in the _Diptera_ order,\r\nassume an appearance of _plumes_--not from the branches that proceed\r\nfrom them, but from the fine long hairs that beset and adorn them.\r\nThese are universally indications of the male sex, those of the\r\nfemales being generally comparatively naked. If you take the common\r\ngnat, you will find that the antennæ of one individual are thickly\r\nfringed on each side, and tufted at the end with fine long hairs,\r\nwhile in the other only four or five placed at intervals in a\r\nwhorl are to be perceived[794]. In _Chironomus_ Meig., a kind of\r\n_Tipula_ L., resembling a gnat, the male antennæ are beset on all\r\nsides with the finest hairs, and resemble a beautiful plume[795],\r\nwhile the females to the unarmed eye appear naked. Even in some\r\n_Hymenoptera_, the antennæ of the males are thus feathered, in a less\r\ndegree: for instance, in _Hylotoma_ Latr.[796] Whether the tufts and\r\nfringes which ornament, in a remarkable manner, the antennæ of many\r\n_Cerambycidæ_[797], are sexual characters, is not certainly known.\r\n\r\nWe are now to consider other sexual differences in these organs,\r\nresulting from the size or configuration of one or more _individual\r\njoints_. To begin with the first joint, or scapus. In many of\r\nthe _Hymenoptera_, particularly the _Anthophila_ Latr., this is\r\nelongated, and the remaining joints form an angle with it in the\r\nfemales: while in the other sex it is much shorter, and in the\r\nsame line with the rest of the antennæ; and in _Hylæus dilatatus_\r\n(_Melitta dilatata_ Kirby) the first joint in the male is dilated and\r\nshaped something like a patella[798]. In _Malachius bipustulatus_,\r\n&c. the sex just mentioned is peculiarly distinguished by a white\r\nexcrescence on the first four joints of the organs in question,\r\nmost conspicuous in the second and fourth. The antennæ of male\r\n_Cerocomæ_ are not very different[799]. Mr. Marsham has described\r\na little _Haltica_ under the name of _Chrysomela nodicornis_, from\r\na peculiarity of the same sex not to be found in the other. The\r\nfourth joint is very large and obtriangular; in the female it is\r\nmerely longer than the rest. In _H. Brassicæ_ and _quadripustulata_\r\nthe fifth joint is larger and longer than all but the first in the\r\nmale, in their females it is only longer. In some moths (_Herminia_\r\nLatr., _Crambus_ F.) there is also a knot in the middle of the male\r\nantennæ[800]. In _Noterus_, a water-beetle, the six intermediate\r\njoints are thicker than the rest, beginning from the fourth, and the\r\nlast but one ends internally in a truncated tooth. The fifth and\r\ntwo following joints in the male antennæ of _Meloe_ are larger than\r\nthe rest, which distinguishes them, as well as a remarkable bend\r\nobservable at that part[801].\r\n\r\nVariations of the kind we are considering are also observable in\r\nthe _clava_, or knob, in which antennæ often terminate. You have\r\ndoubtless observed that the lamellated clava of the antennæ of\r\nthe common cockchafer is much longer and more conspicuous in some\r\nindividuals than in others--the long clava belongs to the male[802].\r\nIn another species, _M. Fullo_, that of this sex is nine or ten\r\ntimes the length of that of the other. In _Colymbetes serricornis_,\r\na water-beetle, the male has a serrated clava of four joints. In\r\n_Dorcatoma dresdensis_[803], and also _Enoplium damicorne_, two\r\nbeetles, it is nearly branched in the male, but much less so in\r\nthe female. In a little destructive beetle, common in our houses\r\n(_Attagenus Pellio_), in the latter it is very short, but in the\r\nformer it is very long, and nearly formed by a single joint. In\r\n_Eurhinus_ Kirby, a New Holland genus of the weevil-tribe, in\r\nthe male the last joint, also, is much longer than it is in the\r\nfemale[804]. These examples will give you some idea of the principal\r\nvariations that take place in the antennæ of the sexes, and of the\r\nwonderful diversity of forms in this respect to which mere sexuality\r\ngives rise amongst insects.\r\n\r\nIn the _eyes_, or _stemmata_, this diversity is less remarkable.\r\nLatreille has described two ants, _Formica contracta_ and _coeca_, in\r\nthe neuter of which he could discover no eyes[805]: in the former,\r\nthe female, however, had large ones. The male he appears not to\r\nhave known, but it probably was not destitute of these organs; of\r\nthe latter he was acquainted only with the workers. The neuter of\r\n_Myrmica rubra_, another ant, has no ocelli or stemmata, although the\r\nmale and female are provided with them[806]. They are discoverable\r\nonly in the former sex of that singular insect related to the ants,\r\n_Mutilla europæa_. Other insects differ in the _size_ of the eyes\r\nof their sexes. In the hive-bee, and some _Ephemeræ_, the eyes of\r\nthe drone or male are much larger than those of the worker and\r\nfemale, and also meet at the vertex, having their stemmata below the\r\nconflux; whereas in these latter they are widely distant[807]. In\r\n_Stratyomis_, _Tabanus_, and many other two-winged flies, the _male_\r\neyes meet at some point below the stemmata, and above the antennæ.\r\nIn the former they touch more at an angle; for the vertex forming\r\na narrow isosceles triangle, and for the anterior part of the face\r\none nearly equilateral: while those of the _female_ are separated\r\nby a considerable interval. In _Heptatoma_ and _Hæmatopota_ in that\r\nsex, a similar interval obtains; while in the other, after forming a\r\nminute short triangle, they unite for a considerable space, and then\r\ndiverging, form the face. This is also the case in _Tabanus_; but in\r\nthe female, the space that intervenes between the posterior part of\r\nthe eyes is much narrower than in these two cognate genera of the\r\nhorse-flies. In some others of this order, as _Musca_ Latr., the eyes\r\nof the male do not touch, but approach posteriorly much nearer to\r\neach other than those of the other sex. In a few instances the sexes\r\nvary even in the number of their eyes, as well as the size. This\r\noccurs in some species of _Ephemera_ L. (_E. diptera_, &c.), in which\r\nthe male, besides the common lateral ones, has two large and striking\r\nintermediate eyes, that sit upon vertical pillars or footstalks[808].\r\n\r\n2. The _Trunk_. The thorax of many coleopterous males, especially\r\nof the _Dynastidæ_ and _Copridæ_ amongst the petalocerous tribes,\r\nexhibits very striking differences from that of the female. In\r\nmany _Lucani_ the lateral angle is more prominent. In _Anthia_\r\nit is bilobed posteriorly, while in the last-mentioned sex it is\r\nentire[809]. In _Phanæus carnifex_ MacLeay (_Copris_ F.) it is\r\nelevated into a plane triangular space, with the vertex of the\r\ntriangle pointing to the head; but in the female it is convex, with\r\nan anterior abbreviated transverse ridge[810].\r\n\r\nIn a large proportion terrific _horns_, often hollow, like those\r\nof the head lately noticed, arm the thorax of the male, of which\r\nyou will usually only discover the rudiments in the other sex. In\r\nthe first place, some are _unicorns_, or armed only with a _single_\r\nthoracic horn, which frequently, in conjunction with the thorax\r\nitself, not a little resembles a tunnel reversed: of this description\r\nare _Dynastes Hercules_, _Tityus_, _Gedeon_, _Enema_, &c.[811] In\r\nthe three first this horn is porrected, or nearly in the same line\r\nwith the body; but in the last, and _D. Pan_, it forms an angle with\r\nit; and in _D. Ægeon_ it is nearly vertical[812]. In _D. Hercules_\r\nit is very long; in _D. Alcides_[813] and _Tityus_ very short; in\r\nthe two last, and in _Oxytelus tricornis_ which is similarly armed,\r\nit is undivided at the apex; but in _D. Gedeon_, _Pan_, _bilobus_,\r\n&c.[814] it is bifid or bilobed. It is usually rather slender, but\r\nin _D. Chorinæus_[815] and _bilobus_, it is very stout and wide.\r\nIn _D. claviger_ it is hastate at the apex[816]. In _D. hastatus_\r\nit is short and truncated[817]. Others, again, have _two_ thoracic\r\nhorns. In _Copris nemestrinus_ these are discoidal, diverging, and\r\ninclining forwards[818]. In _Phanæus floriger_[819] they are lateral,\r\ntriangular, and incline towards each other, with, as it were, a\r\ndeep basin between them. In _P. splendidulus_ they sink into two\r\nlongitudinal ridges, most elevated posteriorly, with an intervening\r\nvalley[820]. In _P. bellicosus_ they are posterior, compressed,\r\ntruncated, and emarginate at the apex, and include a basin[821]. In\r\n_Copris Sabæus_ they are merely two acute prominences[822].--_Three_\r\nhorns distinguish the thorax of many. In _D. Aloeus_[823] and its\r\naffinities, they are arranged in a triangle, whose vertex is towards\r\nthe head. In _D. Antæus_[824] these horns are nearly equal in\r\nlength, and undivided at the apex. In _D. Titanus_[825] the anterior\r\nhorn is longer than the rest, and bifid at the apex; in _D. Atlas_\r\nand _Endymion_[826], both of which have a horn on the head, it is\r\nmuch shorter. In others, as in _Megasoma_ Kirby, the vertex of the\r\ntriangle is towards the anus. In _M. Typhon_[827] it is longer than\r\nthe anterior ones, and bifid at the apex; in _M. lanigerum_ they\r\nare equal in length[828]. In _M. Elephas_ and _Actæon_[829] it is\r\nmerely an elevation of the thorax; in the last almost obsolete. In\r\n_Geotrupes Typhæus_, common on our heaths, the anterior of this part\r\nis armed by three horizontal horns, the intermediate one being the\r\nshortest[830]. _Copris lunaris_ also, another of our own beetles,\r\nhas three short posterior thoracic horns, two lateral and triangular\r\nones, and a transverse intermediate elevation, with a notch in the\r\nmiddle[831]. In _Dynastes Neptunus_ the horns are porrected, the\r\nmiddle one being very long, and the lateral ones short[832]. In _D.\r\nGeryon_ the point of the lateral horns is towards the anus, and\r\nthe base of the intermediate one covers the scutellum[833]. Others\r\nhave _four_ of these singular arms: this is the case with one of\r\nour rarest beetles, _Bolbocerus mobilicornis_ K., which has four\r\ndentiform horns, the intermediate pair being the shortest, arranged\r\nin a transverse line on the anterior part of the thorax[834]. In\r\n_B. quadridens_ these are merely teeth. In _Phanæus Faunus_[835] it\r\nhas two lateral, elongated, compressed, truncate, horizontal horns,\r\nand two intermediate teeth. _Dynastes Milon_ has a still greater\r\nnumber of horns on the thorax of the male, there being two lateral\r\nanterior ones and three posterior ones--the intermediate being the\r\nlongest[836]; and _Copris Antenor_ Fabricius and Olivier describe as\r\nhaving a many-toothed thorax; and from the figure of the latter[837],\r\nthe male appears to have seven prominences.\r\n\r\nBut the males of insects are not only occasionally distinguished by\r\nthese dorsal arms--in a few instances they are also furnished with\r\n_pectoral_ ones. The illustrious traveller Humboldt found in South\r\nAmerica a species of weevil (_Cryptorhynchus Spiculator_ Humb.), the\r\nbreast of which was armed with a pair of long projecting horns; and\r\nI possess both sexes of four species, three at least from Brazil,\r\nthat exhibit in one individual the same character. One, concerning\r\nthe country of which I am uncertain, recedes somewhat from the type\r\nof form of the rest, and comes very near that of _Rynchænus Strix_\r\nF.[838] In the individual which I take to be _C. Spiculator_, the\r\npectoral horns are very long, curving upwards at the apex, and\r\nnearly in a horizontal position; while in the three others they are\r\nmuch shorter, and inclined towards the horizon. The males of some\r\nspecies of _Rynchites_, as _R. Bacchus_ and _Populi_[839], are also\r\narmed with a pair of lateral horns or spines, which may be termed\r\npectoral rather than dorsal.\r\n\r\nI shall now advert to the sexual characters that are to be found in\r\nthe _instruments of motion_ attached to the trunk--beginning with\r\nthose for _flight_. In the female of the common glow-worm (_Lampyris\r\nnoctiluca_) not the slightest vestige of elytra or wings is visible,\r\nand it resembles a larva rather than a perfect insect; yet its\r\nmate is a true beetle furnished with both. The same circumstance\r\ndistinguishes the female cockroach (_Blatta_) and is more universally\r\nprevalent in that genus than in _Lampyris_, in which a large number\r\nof females have both elytra and wings. The males of _Bombyx antiqua_\r\nand _Gonostigma_, and of many other moths, have wings of the usual\r\nample dimensions, while those of their females are merely rudiments.\r\nThis is the case, also, with some of the _Ichneumonidæ_[840]. In the\r\ntribes of Ants, _Termites_, &c. the neuters or workers are without\r\nwings. Amongst the plant-lice (_Aphides_) there are individuals\r\nof both sexes, some of which have wings, and others not[841].\r\nAmongst the _Coleoptera_, the female of _Tenebrio Molitor_, the\r\ncommon meal-worm, has elytra and no wings; while the male has\r\nboth[842].--Sometimes these organs vary in size in the sexes: thus\r\nin _Aradus Betulæ_ F., a kind of bug, the hemelytra and wings are\r\nnarrower and shorter in the female than in the male[843]. In the\r\ngenus _Blaps_ F., the mucro that arms the apex of each elytrum is\r\nlonger in the former sex than in the latter. In _Ateuchus gibbosus_\r\nF., a dung-beetle, the elytra have a basal gibbosity near the suture\r\nin one sex that does not obtain in the other. In the _Orthoptera_\r\norder, the sexes are often to be known, almost at first sight, by\r\na difference in the veining and areolets of the wings; but upon\r\nthis I enlarged so fully when I treated of the sounds produced by\r\ninsects, that it is not necessary to repeat what I have said; which\r\nobservation also applies to the drums which distinguish the male\r\n_Cicadæ_[844]. The wings of some butterflies, and of most moths and\r\nhawkmoths (_Sphinx_ L.), are furnished with a singular apparatus for\r\nkeeping them steady, and the under-wing from passing over the upper\r\nin flight. This appears to have been first noticed by _Moses Harris_,\r\nand was afterwards more fully explained by _M. Esprit Giorna_[845].\r\nFrom the base of the under-wing proceeds a strong bristle, received\r\nby an annulus or socket, which springing between the two principal\r\nnervures of the upper-wing terminates in the disk of the wing:\r\nin this annulus the bristle moves to and fro, and prevents the\r\ndisplacement of the under-wing. This apparatus is perfect only in\r\nthe males, which alone have occasion for long flights; the females,\r\nthough they have often several bristles, having no annulus[846].\r\n\r\nThe other instruments of motion, the _legs_, also differ in the\r\nsexes. In some instances they are disproportionably long. This is\r\nparticularly the case with the _anterior_ pair of some beetles, as\r\n_Macropus longimanus_, _Scarabæus longimanus_ L., in which they are\r\nso long as to make the males of these individuals rather inconvenient\r\nin a cabinet. Amongst British beetles _Clytra longimana_ and\r\n_Curculio longimanus_ Marsh. are also remarkable in this respect. In\r\nsome other males the _middle_ pair are the longest; as in _Anthophora\r\nretusa_ Latr., a kind of wild-bee[847]. There are two known instances\r\nof remarkably long _posterior_ legs in the Capricorn tribe, which\r\nI suspect belong to the present head. One is _Saperda hirtipes_\r\nOliv.[848], in which the hind-legs are longer than the whole body,\r\nand adorned with a singular tuft of hairs; and the other a _Clytus_,\r\nI think, which Mr. MacLeay purchased from the late Mr. Marsham's\r\ncollection, in which the hind-legs are not only very long, but have\r\ntarsi convolute, like some antennæ. From analogy I should affirm that\r\nthese were the characters of _male_ insects.\r\n\r\nTo come to the _parts_ of legs. Sometimes the _coxæ_ of the last\r\nmentioned sex are distinguished from those of the female by\r\nbeing armed by a _mucro_ or spine. Thus the male of _Megachile\r\nWillughbiella_, and others of that tribe, have such a spine on the\r\ninner sides of the anterior coxa[849]. The _Trochanter_ also of some\r\ndiffers sexually; and you will find that the posterior one of the\r\nmale in _Anthidium manicatum_ is of a different shape from what it is\r\nin the female[850]. In _Sphodrus leucopththalmus_, one of the beetles\r\ncalled _black dors_, in one sex the same trochanter terminates in a\r\nlong mucro or spine[851], and in the other it is rounded at the apex.\r\n\r\nPeculiar characters in their _thighs_ also often indicate different\r\nsexes. In _Prionus damicornis_ there is a short spine at the apex of\r\nthe _anterior_ ones in the female that is not in the male; while in\r\n_Macropus longimanus_, at their base externally the male is armed\r\nwith a mucro, which I cannot find in the female[852]. In _Scarabæus\r\nlongimanus_ L. this thigh is furnished with two teeth[853].--The\r\n_intermediate_ thighs also sometimes differ. In an _Onitis_ from\r\nChina, a variety perhaps of _O. Sphinx,_ those in the male are\r\ndolabriform, and in the other sex of the ordinary shape. In _Odynerus\r\nspinipes_ they have on their lower side two sinuses, so as to give\r\nthem the appearance of being toothed. The _posterior_ thighs are\r\nsometimes incrassated in the male, and not in the female. This you\r\nwill see in a weevil, not uncommon, _Apoderus Betulæ,_ and also\r\nin many species of _Cimbex_ F., a kind of saw-fly; and the same\r\ncircumstance distinguishes the latter sex in many species of _Lygæus_\r\nF., a kind of bug: I discovered this from _L. cruciger_, of which I\r\nhave both the sexes; and from Stoll's figure of _L. Pharaonis_[854].\r\nIn some of these the female thighs are enormously large. A remarkable\r\nvariation in this respect is observable in the coleopterous genus\r\n_Œdemera_ (_Necydalis_ L.). In _Œ. Podagrariæ_ these limbs are\r\nincrassated in one sex and not in the other[855]; in _Œ. cærulea_\r\nthey are so in both sexes; and in _Œ. ceramboides_ in neither. In\r\n_Pelecinus Polycerator_ F., one of the Ichneumon tribe, or an insect\r\nvery near it from Brazil, these thighs in the female are armed with\r\ntwo spines underneath, which are not in the male.\r\n\r\nThe _anterior tibiæ_ in _Scarabæus longimanus_ L. differ remarkably\r\nin the sexes. In the female they are of the ordinary shape, and\r\nserrated externally; but in the male they are very long, incurved,\r\nand without teeth or serratures[856]. In the males of the genus\r\n_Onitis_ F. they are bent like a bow, and acute at the end; but\r\nin the females they are formed on the common type[857]. In _Hispa\r\nspinipes_ F. they are armed internally with a crooked spine[858].\r\nBut the most extraordinary sexual variation of this joint of the\r\nleg may be seen in the male of _Crabro cribarius_ F. and several\r\nother species of the same family, in which these tibiæ are dilated\r\nexternally into a concavo-convex plate, or rather have one fixed\r\nto them and part of the thigh, of an irregular and somewhat\r\nangular shape[859], with numerous transparent dots, so as not\r\nbadly to resemble a sieve: whence the trivial name of the species.\r\nRolander, who first described it, fancied that this plate was really\r\nperforated, and that by means of it the animal actually sifted the\r\npollen; but it is most probably for sexual purposes. In another\r\nspecies, the plate is ornamented with transparent converging streaks.\r\nIn the bee-tribes (_Anthophila_ Latr.) the _posterior_ tibia of\r\nthe working sex is generally bigger than the corresponding part in\r\ntheir more idle partners: this is particularly conspicuous in the\r\ngenus _Euglossa_, in the females of which this part is triangular,\r\nvery broad towards the apex, and fitted for carrying a large mass\r\nof pollen paste. The tibiæ of the _males_ of some _Lepidoptera_ are\r\nremarkable in this respect. That of _Hepialus Humuli_ is much more\r\nhairy; but in _H. Hectus_ it is a dilated mis-shapen mass, without a\r\ntarsus, and with long scales pendent from the disk[860]. Differences\r\nof this kind also occur in the _calcaria_ or spurs that arm the apex\r\nof the tibiæ of a large number of insects. Thus in _Acanthopus_ Klug,\r\na singular bee, in the male the spur of the intermediate leg is\r\ndilated at the apex, and armed with six strong spines, the inner one\r\nlarger than the rest[861].\r\n\r\nBut the part of the leg in which the sexes most vary is the _tarsus_;\r\nand this variation takes place both in the number of the joints,\r\nand their form and circumstances. The first case has been observed\r\nonly with regard to certain species of _Cryptophagus_ Herbst, as _C.\r\nfumatus_, &c. in which the female is _pentamerous_, or having _five_\r\njoints in all the tarsi; and the male _heteromerous_, or having\r\n_five_ joints in the two _anterior_ pairs, and only _four_ in the\r\n_posterior_[862]. With respect to the form of the tarsal joints, the\r\nsexes more frequently differ; and by inspecting this part, especially\r\nin the predaceous and carnivorous _Coleoptera_, you may often,\r\nwithout further examination, ascertain whether any individual is male\r\nor female. Even in the slender-footed _Cicindelidæ_, the three first\r\njoints of the anterior tarsus of the male are more dilated than the\r\ntwo last, and covered underneath with a brush of stiffish hair; in\r\nthe female all are equally slender, and not so hairy. In _Carabus_,\r\n_Feronia_, &c. Latr. the _four_ first joints of these tarsi in the\r\nmales are dilated, and furnished with a brush or cushion: in the\r\n_Silphidæ_, also, the same circumstance takes place. In _Harpalus_\r\nLatr., and _Silpha americana_, the _four_ anterior ones are similarly\r\nformed in this respect. But one of the most remarkable sexual\r\ncharacters, in this tribe of insects, that distinguish the males,\r\nare those orbicular patellæ, furnished below with suckers of various\r\nsizes, and formed by the three first joints of the tarsus, which are\r\nto be met with in the _Dytiscidæ_, &c.; but as I shall have occasion\r\nto treat of these more fully in another Letter, I shall only allude\r\nto them now. The second pair of tarsi have in these also the three\r\nfirst joints dilated and cushioned[863]. In _Hydrophilus piceus_,\r\nanother water-beetle, the fifth joint of the tarsus is dilated\r\nexternally, so as to form nearly an equilateral triangle[864].\r\nChristian, a German writer on the _Hymenoptera_, has described\r\nsome very singular appendages which he observed on the first joint\r\nof the four posterior tarsi of _Xylocopa latipes_ F. These were\r\nbattledore-shaped membranaceous laminæ, with a reticulated surface,\r\nof a pale colour; which were fixed in pairs by the intervention of\r\na footstalk to the above joint, on which they sometimes amounted\r\nto more than a hundred: the use of which, he conjectures, is the\r\ncollection of pollen[865]. I possess two specimens of this bee;\r\none has none of these appendages, and on the other I can discover\r\nthem only in one of the tarsi--from which circumstance I am led to\r\nconjecture that, like the supposed _Clavariæ_ that were imagined to\r\ngrow on some humble-bees, but which are now ascertained to be the\r\nanthers of flowers--these also belong to the kingdom of Flora, and\r\nare spoils which the bee in question has filched from the blossom\r\nof some plant. The individuals that have been thus circumstanced\r\nare males; whether the female is guilty of similar spoliations is\r\nnot known. In my specimen there are no traces of them. In many\r\nbees, the first joint of the posterior tarsi is much larger in the\r\nfemales and workers than in the males; but in the hive-bee this\r\njoint is largest in the latter[866]. In _Beris clavipes_ and _Empis\r\nnigra_, two flies, the joint in question is large and thick in the\r\nmale, but slender in the female. The penultimate tarsal joint in the\r\nposterior legs is dilated internally, and terminates in a mucro in\r\none sex of _Anoplognathus Dytiscoides_ of Mr. W. MacLeay[867]. In\r\nsome insects the anterior tarsus of the males has been supposed to\r\nbe altogether wanting: I allude to the petalocerous genus _Onitis_\r\nF.; but I have a specimen of _Onitis Apelles_ of this sex, or a\r\nspecies nearly related to it, in which one of these tarsi is to be\r\nfound[868]; which, though very slender, consists of five joints,\r\nand is armed with a double claw: from which circumstance it may, I\r\nthink, be concluded, that although, as in _Phanæus_, these tarsi are\r\nvery minute, they are not wanting. What renders this more probable\r\nis, a circumstance which every collector of insects, who has many\r\nspecimens of Mr. W. MacLeay's _Scarabæidæ_ in his cabinet, must have\r\nnoticed: namely, that in all, except _Copris_ and _Onthophagus_, the\r\nanterior tarsi are usually broken off. Out of seventeen individuals\r\nof _Scarabæus_ MacLeay in my own, not a single one has a relic of\r\nan anterior tarsus; and scarcely one in a much greater number of\r\n_Phanæi_. The tarsus in question in the nobler sex in _Crabro_, at\r\nleast in _C. cribrarius_ and its affinities, is also very short,\r\nespecially the three intermediate joints; but at the same time very\r\nbroad and flat. In the species just named, the external claw forms\r\na kind of hook; and in the rest it is considerably longer than the\r\nother[869]. The _claws_, indeed, occasionally vary in the sexes in\r\nother _Hymenoptera_: thus in _Melecta_ Latr., a kind of bee, in the\r\nfemale they are intire, but in the male they are furnished with an\r\ninternal submembranaceous tooth or process[870]. In _Cœlioxys conica_\r\nand others, those of the latter sex are bifid at the apex, but those\r\nof the former acute[871]. In _Megachile_, the male claw is as in the\r\ninstance just mentioned, while the female has a lateral tooth[872];\r\nand a similar character distinguishes the sexes in the hive-bee[873].\r\n\r\n3. The _abdomen_. This part affords many external sexual characters,\r\nwhether we consider its general shape; the number of segments that\r\ncompose it; its base, middle, or extremity.\r\n\r\nIn general _shape_ it often differs in the sexes. Thus, the abdomen\r\nof female _Tipulæ_ is lanceolate; that of the male cylindrical, and\r\nthickest at the extremity[874]. In _Molorchus_ F. it is convex above\r\nin the former, and flat in the latter,--the female of this beetle not\r\nunaptly representing some female _Ichneumons_ in this respect, and\r\nthe male their males[875]. In _Andrena_ it is oblong in the one, and\r\nlanceolate in the other. In the hive-bee the drones have a thick,\r\nobtuse, and rather long abdomen; in the females it is long, and\r\nnearly represents an inverted cone; and in the workers a three-sided\r\nfigure, or prism.\r\n\r\nThe _number of segments_, also, is generally different in the two\r\nsexes--the male having one more than the female; but in _Dytiscus\r\nmarginalis_, &c. the reverse of this takes place: the female, if you\r\nreckon the bipartite half-concealed anal segment as one, having seven\r\nventral segments, and the male only six. She has also eight dorsal, and\r\nthe male seven.--In the ant tribes (_Formica_ L.), the little vertical\r\nscale, at the _base_ of the abdomen in one description of them, or the\r\ndouble knot in another, is less in the male than in the female. In a\r\nvery singular male insect belonging to the _Vespidæ_, and related to\r\n_Synagris_, (which I purchased from the late Mr. Drury's cabinet,)\r\nthe second ventral segment sends forth from its disk two remarkable\r\nparallel very acute and rather long spines. The same sex of _Chelostoma\r\nmaxillosa_ has likewise on the same segment a concave elevation,\r\nopposite to which on the fifth is a cavity which receives it, when the\r\nanimal rolls itself up to take its repose[876]. In another species, _C.\r\nCampanularum_, the segment in question has only a tubercle[877].\r\n\r\nOn the second segment of the abdomen of some specimens, probably\r\nmales, of the remarkable African genus _Pneumora_ before alluded\r\nto[878], there are thirteen little elevated ridges, placed rather\r\nobliquely in an oblique series; and gradually, though slightly,\r\ndiminishing in size towards the belly: on their upper side they\r\nare flat, forming nearly a horizontal ledge, but on the lower they\r\nslope to the abdomen. The posterior thigh in its natural position\r\ncovers the three first of them, and, if moved downwards, would strike\r\nthem all[879]. I conjecture, therefore, that these are the animal's\r\ninstruments of sound, imitating the harp or violin rather than the\r\ndrum; and that the thigh acts the part of the hand or bow. The\r\nabdomen of these insects being blown out like a bladder, and almost\r\nempty[880], must emit a considerable sound when the thigh of the\r\nanimal passes briskly over these ridges; and their different length\r\nwould produce a modulation in the sound. When struck with a pin, they\r\nemit a grating noise.\r\n\r\nIn _Staphylinus splendens_, the _penultimate_ ventral segment is very\r\ndeeply cleft, and the antepenultimate emarginate in one sex, and intire\r\nin the other. In _S. laminatus_, an allied species, the penultimate\r\nsegment is cleft, less deeply, however; but the antepenultimate is\r\nvery short and intire; while the fourth is extremely long, and rounded\r\nat the margin, appearing as if it was only an elevated part of the\r\nlast-mentioned segment; for which it was mistaken by Gravenhorst[881],\r\nwhile it is of the usual form in the other sex.\r\n\r\nThe _extremity_ of the abdomen or its _anal_ segments and organs\r\nfurnish a variety of sexual characters. Sometimes the last dorsal\r\nsegment is emarginate in the male, and not in the female; as\r\nin _Megachile ligniseca_, one of the leaf-cutter bees, _Cimex\r\nhæmorrhoidalis_, &c.[882] At other times little lateral teeth\r\nare added to this notch, as in another of the same tribe, _M.\r\nWillughbiella_[883]. Again, in other males, both the ventral and dorsal\r\nanal segment are armed each with a pair of teeth or mucros, as in\r\n_Chelostoma maxillosa_[884]. In _Anthidium manicatum_, another bee,\r\nthe anus terminates in five spines[885]. In _Cœlioxys conica_ of the\r\nsame tribe, in which this part in the female is very acute, that of\r\nthe male is armed with six points[886]. In that singular Neuropterous\r\ngenus _Panorpa_, while the abdomen of the female is of the ordinary\r\nform, with a pair of biarticulate palpiform organs attached to the\r\nlast retractile joint, or ovipositor, that of the male terminates in\r\na jointed tail, not unlike a scorpion's, at the end of which is an\r\nincrassated joint armed with a forceps[887]. In the common earwig\r\n(_Forficula auricularia_) the two sexes differ considerably in their\r\nanal forceps: in one it is armed with internal teeth at the base, and\r\nsuddenly dilated, above which dilatation it is bent like a bow: in the\r\nother it is smaller, without teeth, grows gradually narrower, is very\r\nminutely crenulate from the base to the end, and is straight, except at\r\nthe very summit, where it curves inwards. Misled by these and similar\r\ndifferences, Mr. Marsham has considered them (the sexes both of _F.\r\nauricularia_ and _F. minor_) as distinct species.\r\n\r\nThe tail of some species of the genus _Ephemera_ is furnished with\r\nthree long, jointed, hairy bristles. We learn from Reaumur with\r\nrespect to one, that though in the female these are all equal in\r\nlength, yet in the male there is only a rudiment of the third. On\r\nthe belly near the anus these males have four fleshy appendages, the\r\nposterior ones setaceous and long, and the anterior pair filiform and\r\nshorter. They are supposed to represent the anal forceps of other\r\ninsects[888]. In _Ephemera vulgata_, described by De Geer, both sexes\r\nhave three bristles, but those of the male are the longest; and he\r\ndescribes the forceps as consisting of only a pair of jointed pieces,\r\nforming a bow not unlike the forceps of an earwig[889].\r\n\r\n\r\nv. All the differences I have hitherto noticed between the sexes\r\nof insects occur in their _bodily_ structure; but there are others\r\nof a somewhat higher description observable in their _character_.\r\nYou may smile at the idea of character in beings so minute; but if\r\nyou recollect what I formerly related to you when treating upon the\r\nsocieties of insects, you will allow that something of this kind does\r\ntake place amongst them. In general the males are more fitted for\r\nlocomotion and more locomotive; and the females, on the contrary, are\r\nnecessarily more stationary. And this for an obvious reason:--the law\r\nis, that the male shall seek the female, and therefore he is peculiarly\r\ngifted for this purpose, both in his organs of sensation and motion:\r\nwhile his partner in many cases has very simple antennæ, he has very\r\ncomplex ones; and while she has either no wings or only rudiments\r\nof them, he is amply provided with them. Again: amongst the insects\r\nthat suck the blood of man or beast, such as the gnat (_Culex_) or\r\nhorse-flies (_Tabanidæ_), it is the female alone that is bloodthirsty,\r\nthe males contenting themselves with the nectar of flowers[890]. But\r\nthe difference of character in the sexes is most conspicuous, at least\r\nit has been more noticed, in those that live in societies, and is quite\r\nthe reverse of what takes place in the human species. While the females\r\nand workers (which are now generally considered as sterile females, in\r\nwhich the ovaries are not developed) are laborious and active, diligent\r\nand skilful, wise and prudent, courageous and warlike;--the males, on\r\nthe contrary, take no part in promoting the common weal, except merely\r\na sexual one. Though till a certain period they are supported at the\r\nexpense of the community, they take no part in its labours, either in\r\ncollecting and forming the public stores, or in feeding and attending\r\nthe young. They are idle, cowardly, and inactive; have neither art\r\nnor skill of any kind, and are unprovided with the usual offensive\r\nweapons of their species. These observations in their full force\r\napply particularly to the hive-bee, and partially to the other social\r\ninsects; amongst which, if you consult my former communications, there\r\nare some exceptions to this slothful character in the males[891].\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Age._ There is less diversity in the duration of the lives of\r\ninsects in their perfect than in their larva or pupa state. Some,\r\nlike several species of _Ephemeræ_, live only a few hours; some never\r\neven see the sun[892]: others, as flies, moths, and butterflies,\r\nand indeed the majority of insects, a few days or weeks; and a\r\ncomparatively small number, such as some of the larger _Coleoptera_,\r\n_Orthoptera_, &c., six, nine, twelve, or fifteen months--a period\r\nbeyond which the life of perfect insects rarely extends. Some,\r\nhowever, certainly enjoy a longer existence in the perfect state.\r\nMr. Baker kept one of the darkling beetles (_Blaps Mortisaga_) alive\r\nunder a glass upwards of three years. The rose-beetle (_Cetonia\r\naurata_), Rösel informs us he fed with fruit and moist white bread\r\nfor as long a period[893]. Esper kept our most common water-beetle\r\n(_Dytiscus marginalis_) in water in a large glass vessel, feeding\r\nit with meat, for three years and a half[894]. With regard to the\r\n_Arachnida_, from the very slow growth of _Scorpio europæus_,\r\nRösel suspects that it must live two or three years; and Audebert\r\nis stated to have kept a spider for several[895]. In this respect\r\ninsects follow a law very different from that which obtains amongst\r\nvertebrate animals. In these the duration of their life is in\r\nproportion to the term of their growth: those which attain to\r\nmaturity the latest, in almost every case living the longest. In\r\ninsects, on the contrary, we often meet with the very reverse of this\r\nrule. Thus the larva of the great goat-moth (_Cossus ligniperda_)\r\nis three years, that of the cabbage-butterfly (_Pieris Brassicæ_)\r\nnot three months, in attaining maturity; yet the perfect insects\r\nlive equally long. _Melolontha vulgaris_, which in its first state\r\nlives four years, as a beetle lives only eight or ten days[896]. And\r\nsome _Ephemeræ_, whose larvæ have been two years in acquiring their\r\nfull size, live only an hour; while the flesh-fly, whose larva has\r\nattained to maturity in three or four days, will exist several weeks.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another anomaly in the duration of the life of perfect\r\ninsects. This is not, as in larger animals, a fixed period liable\r\nto be shortened only by accident or disease, and incapable of being\r\nprolonged; but an indeterminate one, whose duration is dependent on\r\nthe earlier or later fulfilment of a particular animal function--that\r\nof propagation. The general law is, that a few days, or at most weeks,\r\nafter the union of the sexes, both perish, the female having first\r\ndeposited her eggs. If, therefore, this union takes place immediately\r\nafter the disclosure of the insect from the pupa, their existence\r\nin the perfect state will not exceed a few _days_ or _weeks_, or in\r\nsome cases _hours_, as in that of the _Ephemera_, and likewise of\r\nthe _Phalænæ Attaci_ L. &c., which fall down dead immediately after\r\noviposition[897]. But if by any means it be put off or prevented, their\r\nlife may be protracted to three or four times that period. Gleditsch\r\nasserts, that by keeping apart the sexes of a grasshopper, their lives\r\nwere prolonged to eight or nine weeks, instead of two or three, their\r\nordinary length; and under similar circumstances _Ephemeræ_, which\r\nusually perish in a day, have been kept alive seven or eight. It is\r\nin consequence of this very curious fact, which has not received from\r\nphysiologists the attention that it merits, that many butterflies and\r\nother insects, which, when excluded from the pupa in summer, perish in\r\nless than a month, live through the winter, if excluded late in the\r\nautumn, and the union of the sexes does not ensue. It is probable that\r\nthe great age to which Baker's _Blaps_, Rösel's _Cetonia_, and Esper's\r\n_Dytiscus_ attained, was owing to their being virgins when taken, and\r\nsubsequently kept from any sexual intercourse. A parallel case happens\r\nin the vegetable kingdom:--if annual plants are kept from seeding, they\r\nwill become biennial; as, likewise, if they are sown too late in the\r\nyear to produce seeds.\r\n\r\nIn the case, however, of the earlier or later exclusion of the imago,\r\nanother agent has probably some influence. Buffon found that, other\r\ncircumstances being alike, the silkworm-moths placed in a _northern_,\r\nlived longer than those exposed to a _southern_ aspect: whence it\r\nappears that the stimulus of heat shortens the lives of insects, and\r\nconsequently that cold tends to lengthen them.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed too, that as the death of the female insect does\r\nnot take place until all the eggs are excluded, the term of her life,\r\nthough usually short in the majority of species, which lay their\r\nwhole number at once, is proportionably long in those which, like\r\nthe queen-bee, have a longer period assigned them for this important\r\noffice. Huber affirms, that he had certain proofs that she was\r\nengaged for two years in laying eggs, all impregnated by a single\r\nsexual union[898]; and in the females of most insects that live in\r\nsociety, several months are required to mature the last eggs that are\r\nin the ovary. There is one tribe of insects, however, the females\r\nof which are affirmed to survive this operation: I mean _Dorthesia_\r\nBosc; after which they even moult, though not so often as before[899].\r\n\r\nI formerly related to you the singular fact, that the drones in a\r\nbeehive at a certain period are without mercy slaughtered by the\r\nworkers[900]. A fact the reverse of this is recorded by Morier with\r\nrespect to the locusts: he affirms that the female, when she has done\r\nlaying her eggs, is surrounded and killed by the males. He says that\r\nhe never himself witnessed this extraordinary circumstance; but that\r\nhe heard it from such authority that he gave full credit to it[901].\r\nIt is a fact, however, that seems to require further evidence to\r\nentitle it to such credit. These are instances in which, by a law of\r\nnature, the life of these insects is shortened by violence. It does\r\nnot appear to have been ascertained how long those drones live that,\r\nunder particular circumstances, as stated in a former letter[902],\r\nare exempted from the usual slaughter.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[683] See above, VOL.

And under this\r\nhead I shall introduce you to a microcosm of wonders, in which the\r\nhand of an ALMIGHTY workman is singularly conspicuous. One would\r\nat first think that the giant bulk of the elephant, rhinoceros, or\r\nhippopotamus, must include a machine far more complicated, a skeleton\r\nmore multifarious in its composition--covered by muscles infinitely\r\nmore numerous--instinct with a nervous system infinitely more\r\nramified--with a greater variety of organs and vascular systems in\r\nplay, than an animal that would scarcely counterpoise a ten-millionth\r\nportion of it. Yet the reverse of this is the fact; for the Creator,\r\nthe more to illustrate his wisdom, power, and skill, has decreed that\r\nthe minute animals whose history we are recording, shall be much\r\nmore complex in all the above respects than these mighty monarchs\r\nof the forest and the flood. Of this in the present and subsequent\r\nletters you will find repeated and scarcely credible instances,\r\nwhich in every rightly constituted mind are calculated to excite, in\r\nan extraordinary degree, those sensations of reverence and love for\r\nthe INVISIBLE AUTHOR of these wonders, and that faith and trust in\r\nhis Power and Providence, which an attentive survey of the works of\r\nCreation has a natural tendency to produce. And you will not only be\r\nstruck by this circumstance, but equally by the infinite variations\r\nin the structure that will present themselves to your notice; and\r\nthat not sudden and _per saltus_, but by approaches made in the most\r\ngradual manner from one form to another. And all along, where the\r\nuses of any particular organ or part have been ascertained, if you\r\nconsider its structure with due attention, you will find in it the\r\nnicest adaptation of means to an end: a circumstance this, which\r\nproves most triumphantly, that the POWER who immediately gave being\r\nto all the animal forms, was neither a blind unconscious power,\r\nresulting from a certain order of things, as some philosophists love\r\nto speak[903]; nor a formative appetency in the animals themselves,\r\nproduced by their wants, habits, and local circumstances, and giving\r\nbirth, in the lapse of ages, to all the animal forms that now people\r\nour globe[904]; but a Power altogether distinct from and above\r\nnature, and its ALMIGHTY AUTHOR[905].\r\n\r\nI trust that what I have here advanced will excite your attention\r\nto the subject I am now to enter upon; and I flatter myself, that\r\nalthough at first sight it may promise nothing more than a dry and\r\ntedious detail of parts and organs, you will find it not without its\r\npeculiar interest and attraction.\r\n\r\nThis department of the science--the Anatomy of Insects--may\r\nstill be regarded as in its infancy; and considering the almost\r\ninsuperable difficulties which, from the minuteness of the objects,\r\noppose themselves to the skill and instruments of the entomological\r\nanatomist, we can scarcely hope that it will ever attain to that\r\ncertainty and perfection to which, as far as the larger animals\r\nare concerned, anatomy has arrived. Yet infinitely more has been\r\naccomplished than might have been expected, and new accessions of\r\nlight are daily thrown upon it. When we consider what has been done\r\nby Malpighi, Leeuwenhoeck, and especially Swammerdam, we admire the\r\npatience, assiduity, and love of science, that enabled them, in spite\r\nof what seemed insurmountable obstacles, to ascertain, the first with\r\nrespect to the silk-worm, and the latter in numerous instances, the\r\ninternal organization of these minute creatures, as well as their\r\nexternal structure. Reaumur, and his disciple De Geer, extending\r\ntheir researches, have also contributed copiously to our knowledge in\r\nthis branch of our science.\r\n\r\nBut in this field no one has laboured so indefatigably and with so\r\nmuch success as the celebrated Lyonnet; and though his attention was\r\nconfined to one object--the caterpillar of the goat-moth (_Cossus\r\nligniperda_ F.),--every one who studies his immortal work must admire\r\nthe patient and skilful hand, the lyncean eye, and keen intellect,\r\nthat discovered, denuded, and traced every organ, muscle, and fibre\r\nof that animal. Much is it to be regretted that his proposed works\r\non the pupa and imago of the same insect, which, he informs us, were\r\nfar advanced[906], were never finished and given to the world. Our\r\nregret, however, is in some degree diminished by the elaborate work of\r\nM. Herold on the butterfly of the cabbage (_Pieris Brassicæ_), before\r\neulogized[907]; in which he has done much to supply this desideratum.\r\n\r\nIn more modern times, besides Herold, MM. Latreille, Illiger,\r\nMarcelle de Serres, Savigny, Ramdohr, Treviranus Sprengel, Audoin,\r\nChabrier, and, above all, M. Cuvier in his celebrated _Lectures on\r\nComparative Anatomy_, have considerably extended the boundaries of\r\nour knowledge in this department: and much of what I have to say\r\nto you in my letters on this subject, will be derived from these\r\nrespectable sources. In the exterior anatomy of insects, I flatter\r\nmyself that I shall be enabled to make some material additions to the\r\ndiscoveries of my predecessors; though few have occurred to me with\r\nrespect to their internal organization.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the anatomy of the _vertebrate animals_, it is usual,\r\nI believe, to consider, first, the skeleton and its integuments,\r\nwhether of skin or muscle, and their accessories; and afterwards\r\nthe organs of the different vital functions and of the senses. But\r\nin considering the anatomy of _Insects_, the difference before\r\nstated[908], observable between them and the sub-kingdom just\r\nmentioned, as to their structure, renders it advisable to divide\r\nthis subject into two parts--the first treating of their _external_\r\nanatomy, and the second of their _internal_.--I shall begin by\r\ndrawing up for you a Table of the Nomenclature of the parts of their\r\n_external_ crust; its appendages and processes[909], external or\r\ninternal, accompanied by definitions of them; and followed by such\r\nobservations respecting them as the subject may seem to require for\r\nits more full elucidation.\r\n\r\nAnatomists have divided the human skeleton into _three_ greater\r\nsections--the _Head_, the _Trunk_, and the _Limbs_. That of insects,\r\nlikewise, is resolvable into _three_ primary sections, but without\r\nincluding the limbs (which, as being _appendages_, and therefore\r\n_secondary_, had best be considered under the section of which they\r\nform a part), for the _abdomen_ in insects, as well as the rest\r\nof the body, being covered with a _crust_, and forming a distinct\r\npart, may be properly regarded as a _primary_ section. And in fact\r\nthese three parts may be received as primary under another view--the\r\n_head_, as containing the principal organs of _sensation_; the\r\n_trunk_, as containing those of _motion_; and the _abdomen_, as\r\ncontaining those of _generation_[910]. Under each of these primary\r\nsections, I shall consider its respective organs, members, and parts.\r\n\r\nYou are not to expect to find every part included in the following\r\nTable in every insect; since it has been my aim to introduce into it,\r\nthe most remarkable of those that are peculiar to particular tribes,\r\ngenera, &c. With respect to these, I shall generally refer you to the\r\nindividuals in which they may be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _DEFINITIONS._\r\n\r\nCORPUS (the _Body_). The whole crust of the insect; consisting of\r\nthe _Exoderma_ or external covering, and the _Esoderma_ or internal\r\ncuticle that lines it[911]. It is divided into three primary parts,\r\nor sections--_Caput_, _Truncus_, _Abdomen_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSERT FOLDOUT HERE\r\n\r\n\r\nINSERT FOLDOUT HERE\r\n\r\n\r\n                          I. CAPUT (The HEAD).\r\n\r\nThe _Head_ is the anterior section of the body; consisting of a\r\nkind of box without suture or segment, which receives the organs\r\nof sensation and manducation. It includes the _Os_, _Facies_,\r\n_Subfacies_, and _Collum_.\r\n\r\n  i. OS (the _Mouth_). That part of the head which receives and\r\n      prepares the food for passing into the stomach. It includes the\r\n      _Trophi_[912].\r\n\r\n  1. TROPHI (the _Trophi_). The different instruments or organs\r\n      contained in the mouth, or closing it, and employed in\r\n      manducation or deglutition. They include the _Labrum_, _Labium_,\r\n      _Mandibulæ_, _Maxillæ_, _Lingua_, and _Pharynx_.\r\n\r\n  A LABRUM (the _Upper-lip_). A usually moveable organ; which,\r\n      terminating the face anteriorly, covers the mouth from _above_,\r\n      and is situate between the _Mandibulæ_[913]. It includes the\r\n      _Appendicula_.\r\n\r\n  a APPENDICULA (the _Appendicle_). A small piece sometimes appended\r\n      to the upper-lip[914]. Ex. _Halictus_ ♀ Walck. (_Melitta_ **. b.\r\n      K.)\r\n\r\n  B LABIUM (the _Under-lip_). A moveable organ, often biarticulate,\r\n      which terminating the surface anteriorly, covers the mouth from\r\n      _beneath_, and is situate between the _Maxillæ_[915]. It includes\r\n      the _Mentum_, and _Palpi Labiales_.\r\n\r\n  a MENTUM (the _Chin_). The lower joint of the _Labium_, where it\r\n      is jointed; in other cases its base. It is usually seated between\r\n      the base of the _Maxillæ_[916].\r\n\r\n  b PALPI LABIALES (the _Labial Feelers_). Two jointed sensiferous\r\n      organs, the use of which is not clearly ascertained, which\r\n      emerge, one on each side, from the _Labium_, mostly near its\r\n      summit[917].\r\n\r\n  C MANDIBULÆ (the _Upper-jaws_). Two transverse lateral organs,\r\n      in most insects used for manducation; generally corneous,\r\n      moving horizontally, and closing the mouth above, under the\r\n      _Labium_[918]. They include the _Prostheca_, _Dentes_, and _Mola_.\r\n\r\n  a PROSTHECA (the _Prostheca_). A subcartilaginous process attached\r\n      to the inner side, near the base, of the _Mandibulæ_ of some\r\n      _Staphylinidæ_[919]. Ex. _Ocypus similis_ K., _Creophilus\r\n      maxillosus_ K., &c.\r\n\r\n  b DENTES (the _Teeth_). The terminating points of the _Mandibulæ_.\r\n      They include the _Incisores_, _Laniarii_, and _Molares_[920].\r\n\r\n  _A_ INCISORES (the _Cutting-teeth_). Teeth somewhat wedge-shaped,\r\n      externally convex and internally concave[921]. Ex. _Gryllotalpa_\r\n      Latr., _Gryllus_ Latr.

A broad, flat, subrotund space, transversely\r\n      grooved or furrowed, observable on the inner side of some\r\n      mandibles that have no grinding-teeth at their apex[924].\r\n      Ex. _Euchlora_ MacLeay, _Anoplognathus_ Leach, Larva of\r\n      _Lucanus_[925].\r\n\r\n  D MAXILLÆ (the _Under-jaws_). Two organs moving subhorizontally,\r\n      fixed on each side at the base of the _Labium_, and often\r\n      parallel with it--which in masticating insects seem primarily\r\n      designed to hold the food[926]. They include the _Cardo_,\r\n      _Stipes_, _Lobi_, and _Palpi maxillares_.\r\n\r\n  a CARDO (the _Hinge_). A small, transverse, usually triangular,\r\n      corneous piece, upon which the _Maxilla_ commonly sits[927].\r\n\r\n  b STIPES (the _Stalk_).

The outer lobe of the\r\n      _Maxilla_, incumbent on the inner one. In the _Predaceous\r\n      Beetles_ this lobe is biarticulate and palpiform[930]; and in\r\n      _Staphylinus olens_, &c. it also consists of two joints[931]. It\r\n      is called the _Galea_ by Fabricius, in _Orthoptera_, &c.[932]\r\n\r\n  _B_ LOBUS INFERIOR (the _Lower-lobe_). The inner lobe of the\r\n      _Maxilla_, covered by the outer one[933].\r\n\r\n  _C_ UNGUES (the _Claws_). One or more corneous sharp claws which\r\n      arm the lobes of the _Maxilla_[934]. In the _Predaceous\r\n      Beetles_ there is only one terminating the lower lobe, with\r\n      which, in _Cicindela_, it articulates; in the _Orthoptera_ and\r\n      _Libellulina_ there are several.\r\n\r\n  d PALPI MAXILLARES (the _Maxillary Feelers_). Two jointed\r\n      sensiferous organs, the use of which is not clearly ascertained,\r\n      emerging from an exterior lateral sinus of the _Maxilla_[935].\r\n\r\n  E LINGUA (the _Tongue_). The organ situated within the _Labium_ or\r\n      emerging from it, by which insects in many cases collect their\r\n      food and pass it down to the _Pharynx_, situated at its roots\r\n      above. It varies considerably in different orders and tribes.\r\n      In the _Orthoptera_, _Libellulina_, &c. it is _linguiform_, and\r\n      quite distinct from the _Labium_[936]; it appears also distinct\r\n      in the _lamellicorn_ beetles, &c.[937] In many _Hymenoptera_\r\n      it emerges from the _Labium_, and is fitted to collect liquids\r\n      and pass them downwards[938]. In _Formica_ it appears to be\r\n      retractile[939]. In a considerable proportion of insects it\r\n      seems connate with the _Labium_, and forming its inner surface?\r\n      According to circumstances it might perhaps be denominated\r\n      _Lingua_ or _Ligula_. It includes the _Paraglossæ_.\r\n\r\n  a PARAGLOSSÆ (the _Paraglossæ_). Lateral and often membranous\r\n      processes observable on each side of the tongue in some\r\n      _Hymenoptera_, &c.[940]\r\n\r\n  F PHARYNX (the _Pharynx_). The opening into the gullet[941].

An appendage of the lower\r\n      margin of the _Pharynx_, observable in _Eucera_ F.[943]\r\n\r\n_The_ seven _organs of the mouth above defined_, viz. _the_ Labrum,\r\nLabium, _the two_ Mandibulæ, _the two_ Maxillæ, _and the_ Lingua,\r\n_constitute what may be denominated a_ perfect _mouth, peculiar\r\nto those insects that_ masticate _their food_[944]. _In those\r\nthat take it by_ suction, _the_ Trophi, _to adapt them for that\r\npurpose, assume a variety of forms, and should be distinguished by\r\nas many appellations. In almost every case, however, the_ rudiments\r\n_or_ representatives _of the above organs have been detected by\r\nthe elaborate researches of that learned and able zoologist, M.\r\nSavigny_[945]. _I shall next subjoin definitions of the principal\r\nkinds of suctorious mouths._\r\n\r\n  2. PROMUSCIS (the _Promuscis_). The oral instrument of _Hemiptera_,\r\n      in which the ordinary _Trophi_ are replaced[946] by a jointed\r\n      sheath, covered above at the base by the _Labrum_, without\r\n      _Labella_ (Liplets) at the end, and containing four long\r\n      capillary lancets, and a short tongue[947].

The whole lower part of the _Theca_, from the\r\n      mouth of the insect as far as the _Labella_, probably to be\r\n      regarded as representing the _Mentum_?\r\n\r\n  b LABELLA (the _Liplets_). A pair of tumid lobes, often corrugated\r\n      and capable of tension and relaxation, which terminate\r\n      the _Theca_, and perhaps represent the termination of the\r\n      _Labium_[954]?\r\n\r\n  B HAUSTELLUM (the _Haustellum_). The instrument of suction\r\n      contained in the _Theca_[955]. It includes the _Valvula_,\r\n      _Cultelli_, and _Scalpella_.\r\n\r\n  a VALVULA (the _Valvule_). A corneous piece which covers the\r\n      instruments of suction above, representing the _Labrum_ in a\r\n      perfect mouth[956].\r\n\r\n  b CULTELLI (the _Knives_). The upper pair of the instruments of\r\n      suction, which probably make the first incision in the food\r\n      of the insect; they represent the _Mandibulæ_ of the perfect\r\n      mouth[957].\r\n\r\n  c SCALPELLA (the _Lancets_). A pair of instruments, usually more\r\n      slender than the _Cultelli_, which probably enter the veins or\r\n      sap-vessels, and together with them form a tube for suction[958].\r\n\r\n  4. ANTLIA (the _Antlia_). The oral instrument of _Lepidoptera_, in\r\n      which the ordinary _Trophi_ are replaced by a spiral, bipartite,\r\n      tubular machine for suction, with its appendages[959].

The intermediate subquadrangular pipe,\r\n      formed by the union of the two branches of the _Antlia_, which\r\n      conveys the nectar to the _Pharynx_[961]. These two branches\r\n      represent the _Maxillæ_ of the perfect mouth.--N. B. M. Savigny\r\n      _discovered the rudiments of the remaining_ Trophi _in this kind\r\n      of mouth_[962].\r\n\r\n  5. ROSTRULUM (the _Rostrulum_). The oral instrument of\r\n      _Aphaniptera_ (_Pulex_ L.), in which the ordinary _Trophi_ are\r\n      replaced by a bivalve beak, between the valves of which there\r\n      appear to be three lancets[963]. It includes the _Laminæ_,\r\n      _Scalpella_, and _Ligula_.\r\n\r\n  A LAMINÆ (the _Laminæ_). Two corneous plates which are laterally\r\n      affixed to the mouth of a flea, probably representing the\r\n      _Mandibulæ_ of the perfect mouth, which somewhat resemble the\r\n      beak of a bird[964].\r\n\r\n  B SCALPELLA (the _Lancets_). The two upper or outer instruments,\r\n      probably for making an incision in the skin; these are flat\r\n      and acute, and seem to represent the _Maxillæ_ of the perfect\r\n      mouth[965].\r\n\r\n  C LIGULA (the _Ligula_).

It includes the _Tubulus_ and _Siphunculus_.\r\n\r\n  A TUBULUS (the _Tubulet_). The tube or retractile base of the\r\n      _Rostellum_.\r\n\r\n  B SIPHUNCULUS (the _Siphuncle_). The real instrument of suction,\r\n      which when unemployed is retracted within the tubulet.\r\n\r\n_Besides the above variations from the type of what I call a_ Perfect\r\nMouth, _there are others in which the parts of the_ Trunk _appear to\r\naid in the conversion of the food, and become a kind of accessory_\r\nLabium, Maxilla, &c. _Thus in the_ Myriapods, _the anterior pair of\r\nlegs assume a_ Maxillary _form and office_[967]; _the_ Prosternum\r\n_those of a_ Labium[968]: _in the_ Arachnida, _also, the anterior_\r\nCoxæ _are accessory_ Maxillæ. _In this_ Class, _likewise, as has been\r\nmore than once observed_[969], _the representatives of the interior\r\npair of_ Antennæ _of the_ Crustacea, _are thought to assume the form\r\nand the functions of suctorious_ Mandibles[970].\r\n\r\n  ii.

That portion of the face, often elevated\r\n      and remarkable, situated between the _Labrum_, _Postnasus_,\r\n      and _Genæ_, and with which the _Labrum_ articulates; called by\r\n      Fabricius the _Clypeus_[972]. It includes the _Rhinarium_.\r\n\r\n  A RHINARIUM (the _Nostril-piece_).

A piece, usually triangular, which\r\n      follows the _Dorsolum_; and in _Coleoptera_ is often only a\r\n      continuation of it--placed between the base of the _Elytra_ or\r\n      upper-wings[1052].\r\n\r\n  E FRÆNUM (the _Frænum_). A piece that lies under the lateral\r\n      margin of the _Scutellum_ and _Dorsolum_, or is adjacent to it;\r\n      and which in many cases connects with the base of the upper\r\n      organs of flight, so as to prevent their dislocation, by being\r\n      pushed too far outwards[1053].\r\n\r\n  F PNYSTEGA (the _Pnystega_). A corneous scale or plate, which\r\n      covers certain pneumatic vessels, usually supported by the\r\n      _Scapularia_, in _Libellulina_, &c. becoming dorsal[1054].\r\n\r\n  2.

In _Coleoptera_ the part of the\r\n      _Metathorax_ in which the _Postscutellum_ lies, at first nearly\r\n      horizontal, but posteriorly it takes a vertical direction\r\n      towards the abdomen. In general it may be defined, the part\r\n      that intervenes between the _Postscutellum_ and the _Abdomen_;\r\n      and which in many cases is connected with the posterior basal\r\n      margin of the under-wings, and prevents their being pushed too\r\n      far forwards[1065].\r\n\r\n  e PLEURÆ (the _Pleuræ_).

Very minute hooks in the middle of the\r\n      anterior margin, observable in some _Hymenoptera_, by which the\r\n      under-wing is fixed to the upper, to cause both to act as one\r\n      organ in flight[1070].\r\n\r\n  _d_ PTERYGIUM (the _Pterygium_). In under-wings this is a small\r\n      wing-like appendage, fixed at the base of the wing in some\r\n      _Lepidoptera_[1071].\r\n\r\n  _e_ ALULA (the _Winglet_). A small concavo-convex scarious\r\n      appendage, fixed behind the wings at their base, in many\r\n      _Diptera_[1072].\r\n\r\n  _f_ HALTERES (the _Poisers_).

A corneous scale or lamina\r\n      that covers the pneumatic organs in the _Metathorax_, situated\r\n      sometimes in the _Pleuræ_, as in the _Coleoptera_; at others in\r\n      the _Postfrænum_, as in _Tenthredo_ L.; and sometimes, as in\r\n      the _Libellulina_, between that part and the abdomen[1074].\r\n\r\n  _C_ METAPHRAGMA (the _Metaphragm_). A nearly vertical septum or\r\n      partition, attached behind to the _Postfrænum_, and usually\r\n      deeply cleft at its apex in _Coleoptera_, of a rather horny\r\n      consistence, which forms the upper separation of the second\r\n      cavity of the Alitrunk from that of the _Abdomen_[1075]. It\r\n      affords a point of attachment for many muscles of both alitrunk\r\n      and abdomen. It includes the _Septula_.\r\n\r\n  _a_ SEPTULA (the _Septula_). The lesser ridges and partitions\r\n      raised on the surfaces of the metaphragm, and on those of\r\n      other parts of the cavities of the trunk, serving as points of\r\n      attachment to various muscles[1076].\r\n\r\n  4.

Its anterior mucro,\r\n      in _Coleoptera_, often meets the posterior one of the\r\n      _Mesosternum_, and sometimes appears to form one piece with it,\r\n      as in _Hydrophilus_, and many _Lamellicorn_ beetles. Sometimes,\r\n      as in _Cetonia vitticollis_, it even passes between the _arms_,\r\n      and covers the _Prosternum_, or supplies its place. Behind,\r\n      it often terminates in a bifid mucro. It is not present in\r\n      many Orders: as in the _Hymenoptera_, _Diptera_, &c.[1081] It\r\n      includes the _Pectines_.\r\n\r\n  a PECTINES (the _Pectines_). Two moveable processes, fixed one\r\n      on each side by its base below the posterior legs to the\r\n      _Metasternum_ in _Scorpio_: on the lower side is fixed a series\r\n      of parallel biarticulate processes, resembling the teeth of a\r\n      comb[1082].\r\n\r\n  D POSTFURCA (the _Postfurca_). A process of the _Endosternum_,\r\n      terminating in three subhorizontal acute branches,\r\n      resembling the letter Y, and forming an acute angle with the\r\n      _Endosternum_, to which the muscles that move the hind-legs,\r\n      &c. are affixed[1083].\r\n\r\n  E OPERCULA (the _Opercula_). Plates that cover the vocal\r\n      spiracles in humming insects; and likewise two large\r\n      cartilaginous plates fixed to the posterior part of the\r\n      _Postpectus_, which cover the _Tympana_ in male _Tettigonia_\r\n      F.[1084] Perhaps these may be regarded as a kind of\r\n      _Metapnystega_ in a new situation.\r\n\r\n  F PEDES POSTICI (the _Hind-legs_). The pair of legs affixed to\r\n      the postpectus[1085]. They include, the _Acetabulum_, _Coxa_,\r\n      _Trochanter_, _Femur_, _Tibia_, and _Tarsus_.\r\n\r\n  a ACETABULUM (the _Socket_). The socket in the _Postpectus_ in\r\n      which the leg is planted[1086]. It includes the _Pessella_.\r\n\r\n  _A_ PESSELLA (the _Pessella_). Two little acute processes,\r\n      fixed one in each, in the socket of the hind-legs in male\r\n      _Tettigoniæ_, which appear designed to keep down the\r\n      _Opercula_[1087].\r\n\r\n  b COXA (the _Hip_). The _first_ joint of the leg which plays in\r\n      the socket[1088].\r\n\r\n  c TROCHANTER (the _Trochanter_). The _second_ joint of the leg,\r\n      by which the thigh inosculates in the _Coxa_. It appears to\r\n      have no motion separate from that of the thigh. It is sometimes\r\n      biarticulate[1089].\r\n\r\n  d FEMUR (the _Thigh_). The _third_ joint of the leg, long and\r\n      usually compressed[1090]. It includes the _Gonytheca_.\r\n\r\n  _A_ GONYTHECA (the _Knee-pan_). A concavity at the apex of the\r\n      thigh, underneath, to receive the base of the _Tibia_[1091].\r\n\r\n  e TIBIA (the _Shank_).

They may be regarded as a kind of fingers\r\n      auxiliary to the _Tarsus_, and furnish often an important\r\n      character in the discrimination of genera[1096].\r\n\r\n  _E_ CORONULA (the _Coronula_). A coronet or semicoronet of _fixed_\r\n      spines observable at the apex of the posterior _Tibia_ in\r\n      _Fulgora candelaria_, &c.\r\n\r\n  f TARSUS (the _Tarsus_). The _fifth_ principal portion of the\r\n      legs; consisting in the majority of insects of 1-5 joints,\r\n      but in the _Phalangidæ_ of sometimes as many as 50[1097].

The last joint of the _Tarsus_,\r\n      which bears the claws[1101]. It includes the _Arthrium_,\r\n      _Unguiculi_, and _Plantula_.\r\n\r\n  α ARTHRIUM (the _Arthrium_). A very minute joint at the base of\r\n      the claw-joint, in most Tetramerous and Trimerous beetles[1102].\r\n\r\n  β UNGUICULI (the _Claws_). One or two pair of moveable incurved\r\n      claws, which usually arm the apex of the _Ungula_[1103].\r\n\r\n  γ PLANTULA (the _Plantula_).

Cushions of short hairs very closely\r\n      set; or of membrane, capable of being inflated, or very soft;\r\n      or concave plates, which cover the underside, or their apex,\r\n      of the four first joints of the _Manus_ or _Tarsus_, and\r\n      sometimes even of the ends of the _Calcaria_, as in _Cimbex_;\r\n      which act so as to produce a vacuum, and enable the animal to\r\n      suspend itself, or walk against gravity[1107]. Ex. _Timarcha_,\r\n      _Buprestis_, _Priocera_ K., the _Gryllina_, _Muscidæ_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     III. ABDOMEN (the _Abdomen_).\r\n\r\nThe _Abdomen_ is the _third_ or posterior section of the body which\r\nfollows the _Truncus_[1108].

Two longitudinal soft spaces,\r\n      capable of tension and relaxation, one on each side of the back\r\n      of the abdomen, in which, where they exist, the dorsal spiracles\r\n      are planted[1111]. They include the _Spiracula Dorsalia_.\r\n\r\n  a SPIRACULA DORSALIA (the _Dorsal Spiracles_). Lateral\r\n      breathing-pores observable in the dorsal segments, often covered\r\n      by the preceding segment[1112].\r\n\r\n  ii. VENTER (the _Belly_). The lower or prone part of\r\n      the abdomen[1113]. It includes the _Hypochondria_,\r\n      _Epigastrium_[1114], _Segmenta Ventralia_, and _Elastes_.\r\n\r\n  1. HYPOCHONDRIA (the _Hypochondria_). Two portions of segments, one\r\n      on each side; which in some genera[1115] (_Carabus_ L., &c.)\r\n      intervene between the first _intire_ ventral segment and the\r\n      posterior part of the _Postpectus_.\r\n\r\n  2. EPIGASTRIUM (the _Epigastrium_). The first intire ventral\r\n      segment[1116]. It includes the _Mucro_ and _Tympana_.\r\n\r\n  A MUCRO (the _Mucro_).

Two deep cavities, containing a complex\r\n      machinery on each side of the _Epigastrium_ in male _Tettigoniæ_,\r\n      which are the instruments of sound[1118].\r\n\r\n  3. SEGMENTA VENTRALIA (the _Ventral Segments_). Transverse sections\r\n      of the belly[1119]. In Elytrophorous insects they are usually of\r\n      a firmer consistence than those of the back.

Ex. _Dynastes Aloeus_, &c.\r\n\r\n  4. ELASTES (the _Elastes_). The elastic organs on the ventral\r\n      segments of _Machilis polypoda_ which assist this insect in\r\n      leaping.\r\n\r\n  iii. PETIOLUS (the _Footstalk_). A slender part by which the abdomen\r\n      of many _Hymenoptera_ is united to the trunk, in some genera\r\n      very long, in others very short, and in others wanting[1121]. It\r\n      includes the _Funiculus_, _Foramen_, _Squama_, and _Nodus_.\r\n\r\n  1. FUNICULUS (the _Funiculus_). A small cartilaginous _cord_,\r\n      passing through a minute orifice of the _Postfrænum_, just above\r\n      the point where the footstalk is fixed, to an opposite hole above\r\n      it, which enables the animal the better to elevate or drop the\r\n      abdomen[1122].\r\n\r\n  2. FORAMEN (the _Foramen_). The orifice in the abdomen, through\r\n      which the above cord passes[1123].\r\n\r\n  3. SQUAMA (the _Scale_). A vertical flat scale, observable on the\r\n      footstalk of the genus _Formica_, &c.[1124]\r\n\r\n  4. NODI (the _Knots_). One or more subrotund protuberances of the\r\n      footstalk in the genus _Myrmica_[1125].\r\n\r\n  iv. CAUDA (the _Tail_). Where the abdomen grows suddenly slenderer,\r\n      and terminates in a long jointed tail, as in _Scorpio_ and\r\n      _Panorpa_[1126]. It includes the Centris.\r\n\r\n  1. CENTRIS (the _Centris_). The last inflated joint of the tail,\r\n      terminating in the _Sting_.\r\n\r\n  v. ANUS (the _Anus_). The termination of the abdomen, consisting of\r\n      the two last segments. It includes the _Podex_, _Hypopygium_,\r\n      _Culus_, _Ovipositor_, and _Appendices_.\r\n\r\n  1. PODEX (the _Podex_). The last dorsal segment of the abdomen[1127].\r\n\r\n  2. HYPOPYGIUM (the _Hypopygium_). The last ventral segment of the\r\n      abdomen[1128].\r\n\r\n  3. CULUS (the _Culus_). The orifice at the end of the anus.\r\n\r\n  4. OVIPOSITOR (the _Ovipositor_). The instrument of oviposition,\r\n      by which the insect conducts the eggs to their appropriate\r\n      nidus, and often bores a way to it; the same instrument is by\r\n      some genera used as a weapon of offence, when it is called the\r\n      _Aculeus_[1129]. It includes the _Unci_, _Tubulus_, _Valvæ_,\r\n      _Vaginula_, and _Terebellæ_.\r\n\r\n  A UNCI (the _Unci_). Two pair of robust organs, the upper incurved\r\n      and the lower recurved, with which the anus of _Locusta_ Leach is\r\n      furnished[1130].\r\n\r\n  B TUBULUS (the _Tubulus_). A tubular ovipositor, consisting of\r\n      several pieces often retractile within each other, like the tubes\r\n      of a telescope[1131].\r\n\r\n  C VALVÆ (the _Valves_). Two lateral laminæ, often coriaceous, by\r\n      which the ovipositor when unemployed is covered[1132].\r\n\r\n  D VAGINULA (the _Sheath_). A corneous case, with two grooves, in\r\n      which the _Terebella_ or _Spicula_ play[1133].\r\n\r\n  E TEREBELLÆ (the _Terebellæ_). Instruments by which the insect\r\n      saws or bores a passage for its eggs to the place in which her\r\n      instinct directs her to deposit them[1134].\r\n\r\n  5. ACULEUS (the _Sting_). The above instrument, when fitted for an\r\n      offensive weapon[1135]. It includes, besides the _Valvæ_ and\r\n      _Vaginula_ before defined, the _Spicula_.\r\n\r\n  A SPICULA (the _Darts_). The proper stings which inflict the wound:\r\n      retractile within the sheath, externally serrulate at the\r\n      apex[1136]. They include the _Retinaculum_.\r\n\r\n  a RETINACULUM (the _Retinaculum_). A minute horny moveable scale or\r\n      plate with which the darts are furnished, which prevents their\r\n      dislocation by being shot forth too far[1137].\r\n\r\n  vi.

A pair of anal organs, which open or shut\r\n      transversely, and _cross_ each other[1138]. Ex. Male of _Raphidia\r\n      Ophiopsis_.\r\n\r\n  3. FURCA (the _Fork_). An inflected elastic anal organ, ending in a\r\n      fork, by which the animal is enabled to leap[1139]. Ex. _Podura_.\r\n\r\n  4. STYLI (the _Styles_). Rigid, exarticulate, long and narrow anal\r\n      organs[1140]. Ex. _Staphylinus_.\r\n\r\n  5. FOLIOLA (the _Leaflets_). Rigid, exarticulate, dilated, leaf-like\r\n      anal organs[1141].

Truncated, fistular, setiform anal\r\n      organs, emitting a saccharine fluid[1150]. Ex. _Aphis_.\r\n\r\nYou will observe, that when the _whole upper-side_ of the _Truncus_\r\nis spoken of, it is called the _Thorax_; and as in _Coleoptera_,\r\nand some other Orders, the whole of the _Mesothorax_ except the\r\n_Scutellum_ is covered by the _Thorax_, and the whole of the\r\n_Metathorax_ by the _Mesothorax_ and _Elytra_--the _Thoracic shield_,\r\nmay without danger of mistake be denominated the _Thorax_, as it has\r\nalways been. When the _whole under-side_ of the _Trunk_ is spoken of,\r\nit is called the _Pectus_. When the _three Sternums_ are spoken of\r\ntogether, they may be called the _Sternum_; and the _whole interior\r\nelevation_ of the _Pectus_ may be called the _Endosternum_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[903] Lamarck _Hist. Nat. des Anim. sans Vertèbr._ i. 311, 214.\r\n\r\n[904] _Ibid._ 162. Compare the _Systême des Anim. sans Vertèbr._ of\r\nthe same author, p. 12--.\r\n\r\n[905] The doctrine of Epicurus--that the Deity concerns not himself\r\nwith the affairs of the world or its inhabitants, which, as Cicero\r\nhas judiciously observed (_De Nat. Deor._ 1. 1. ad calcem), while it\r\nacknowledges a God in _words_, denies him in _reality_; has furnished\r\nthe original stock upon which most of these bitter fruits of modern\r\ninfidelity are grafted. Nature, in the eyes of a large proportion of\r\nthe enemies of Revelation, occupies the place and does the work of\r\nits Great Author. Thus Hume, when he writes against miracles, appears\r\nto think that the Deity has delegated some or all of his powers to\r\nnature, and will not interfere with that trust. _Essays_, ii. 75--.\r\nAnd to name no more, Lamarck, treading in some measure in the steps\r\nof Robinet (who supposes that all the links of the animal kingdom,\r\nin which nature gradually ascends from low to high, were experiments\r\nin her progress towards her great and ultimate aim--the formation of\r\nman. Barclay _On Organization_, &c. 263), thus states his opinion:\r\n\"La nature, dans toutes ses opérations, ne pouvant procéder que\r\ngraduellement, n'a pu produire tous les animaux à-la-fois: elle n'a\r\nd'abord formé que les plus simples; et passant de ceux-ci jusques\r\naux plus composés, elle a établi successivement en eux différens\r\nsystêmes d'organes particuliers, les a multipliés, en a augmenté de\r\nplus en plus l'énergie, et, les cumulant dans les plus parfaits,\r\nelle a fait exister tous les animaux connus avec l'organisation et\r\nles facultés que nous leur observons.\" (_Anim. sans Vertèbr._ i.\r\n123.) Thus denying to the Creator the glory of forming those works\r\nof creation, the animal and vegetable kingdom (for he assigns to\r\nboth the same origin, _Ibid._ 83), in which his glorious attributes\r\nare most conspicuously manifested; and ascribing them to nature, or\r\n_a certain order of things_, as he defines it (214)--a blind power,\r\nthat operates necessarily (311); which he admits, however, to be the\r\nproduct of the will of the Supreme Being (216). It is remarkable,\r\nthat in his earlier works, in which he broaches a similar opinion,\r\nwe find no mention of a Supreme Being. (See his _Systême des Animaux\r\nsans Vertèbres_, Discours d'Ouverture.) Thus we may say that, like\r\nhis forerunner Epicurus, _Re tollit_, dum _oratione relinquit Deum._\r\nBut though he ascribes all to _nature_; yet as the _immediate_ cause\r\nof all the animal forms, he refers to the local circumstances, wants,\r\nand habits of individual animals themselves; these he regards as the\r\nmodifiers of their organization and structure (162). To show the\r\nabsurd nonplus to which this his favourite theory has reduced him,\r\nit will only be necessary to mention the individual instances which\r\nin different works he adduces to exemplify it. In his _Systême_,\r\nhe supposes that the web-footed birds (_Anseres_) acquired their\r\nnatatory feet by frequently separating their toes as far as possible\r\nfrom each other in their efforts to swim. Thus the skin that unites\r\nthese toes at their base contracted a habit of stretching itself; and\r\nthus in time the web-foot of the duck and the goose were produced.\r\nThe waders (_Grallæ_), which, in order to procure their food, must\r\n_stand_ in the water, but do not love to _swim_, from their constant\r\nefforts to keep their bodies from submersion, were in the habit of\r\nalways stretching their legs with this view, till they grew long\r\nenough to save them the trouble!!! (13--). How the poor birds escaped\r\ndrowning before they had got their web feet and long legs, the author\r\ndoes not inform us. In another work, which I have not now by me,\r\nI recollect he attributes the long neck of the camelopard to its\r\nefforts to reach the boughs of the mimosa, which, after the lapse of\r\na few thousand years, it at length accomplished!!! In his last work,\r\nhe selects as an example one of the _Molluscæ_, which, as it moved\r\nalong, felt an inclination to explore by means of _touch_ the bodies\r\nin its path: for this purpose it caused the nervous and other fluids\r\nto move in masses successively to certain points of its head, and\r\nthus in process of time it acquired its horns or tentacula!! _Anim.\r\nsans Vertèbr._ i. 188.

Latreille, Savigny, &c. have regarded as\r\nentitled to that denomination. Thus in _Hymenoptera_, their _Mentum_\r\nis what we term the _Labium_, while our _Mentum_ is the small piece\r\nupon which that part sits (PLATE VII. FIG. 3. a´´). This is called\r\nthe _Fulcrum_ in _Mon. Ap. Angl._ (See i. Explan. of the Plates.)

These reasons, and others we\r\nshall state hereafter, induced us long ago to consider this part\r\nas not representing the _Prothorax_; and they seem to have induced\r\nM. Chabrier almost to adopt a similar opinion. _Sur le Vol des\r\nInsectes._ _Ann. du Mus._ 3eme Ann. 414. et 4eme Ann. 54--.\r\n\r\n[1013] PLATE XXII. FIG. 8, 11. _h´._\r\n\r\n[1014] Ibid. FIG. 8.

In this we may notice its _substance_, general\r\n_form_, _sculpture_, _pubescence_, and _composition_.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. I have already noticed the _substance_ of this integument in\r\nthe preparatory states of insects[1151]; I shall not, therefore,\r\nhere repeat what I then said, but restrict myself chiefly to the\r\nconsideration of it as it is found in their _last_ state, in which\r\nit is usually firmer than in their previous stages of existence. In\r\nthis respect, however, it varies much in the different Orders, and\r\neven in the different genera of the same Order. In some Coleopterous\r\ninsects, for instance, it is very hard, and difficult to perforate;\r\nwhile in others it is soft, flexible, and a pin easily passes through\r\nit[1152]. And in general, from a substance in hardness resembling\r\nhorn or shell, it passes through the intermediate degrees of that of\r\nleather and parchment, almost to a thin membrane. Yet in all cases\r\nthere is enough of rigidity and hardness to answer the principal uses\r\nof a skeleton--to afford, namely, a sufficient point of attachment\r\nfor the muscles, and to support and defend the interior organization;\r\nso that the play and action of the vital and secretory systems may\r\nnot be interrupted or impeded.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the principles which enter into the composition\r\nof this integument, very little seems to be known at present; but\r\nfew insects having been submitted to a chemical analysis. The\r\nblister-beetle (_Cantharis vesicatoria_), from its importance in\r\nmedicine, has, however, been more than once analysed; and though the\r\nproducts have not been very precisely stated, yet we find amongst\r\nthem phosphate of lime, albumen, and some other usual components\r\nof the substance of vertebrate animals[1153]. But which of these\r\nproducts belong to the integument, and which to its contents, cannot\r\nbe ascertained, without a separate process for each; which would\r\nnot, I conceive, be very feasible. The substance, however, of the\r\nintegument of insects, though we know not its precise contents,\r\nwhich probably vary in different genera, &c., appears not to be\r\nexactly of the nature of any of those substances after which it\r\nhas usually been denominated: it is not properly analogous either\r\nto real _horn_, _shell_, _skin_, or _leather_, &c. This seems to\r\nresult from the following circumstance:--Most of the excretions of\r\nvertebrate animals, as horn, skin (at least when tanned), feathers,\r\nwool, hair, &c. when exposed to the action of fire liquify, more or\r\nless, before they incinerate; emitting at the same time a peculiar\r\nand disagreeable scent: but upon applying this test to the parts of\r\ninsects of the different Orders, I found, in every instance, that\r\nincineration took place without liquefaction, and was unaccompanied\r\nby that peculiar scent which distinguishes the others. Even the\r\n_claws_, which to the eye appear, as to their substance, exactly\r\nlike those of _Mammalia_, birds, &c. burn without melting, and\r\nretain their form after red heat. That the insect integument is\r\nnot _calcareous_ like that of the _Crustacea_, and the shells of\r\n_Molluscæ_, you may easily satisfy yourself, by immersing them in\r\nan acid test. I made this experiment upon portions of insects of\r\nseveral of the Orders, in an equal mixture of muriatic acid and\r\nwater, and the result was, not only that all hexapods, but octopods,\r\n_Arachnida_, and even _Scolopendridæ_, upon immersion only emitted\r\na few air-bubbles; while, when the other myriapods, _Polydesmus_,\r\n_Iulus_, _Glomeris_, &c. and the _Oniscidæ_, were immersed, a\r\nviolent effervescence took place; proving the different nature of\r\ntheir substance. It is remarkable that the two great branches of\r\nthe _Myriapods_, the _Scolopendridæ_ and _Iulidæ_ (_Chilopoda_ and\r\n_Chilognatha_ Latr.), should in this respect be so differently\r\ncircumstanced--the latter having a calcareous integument, and the\r\nformer not.--A further difference distinguishes these two tribes:\r\n_old_ specimens of the _Iulidæ_ usually lose their colour and turn\r\nwhite, like _Oniscidæ_; while those of the _Scolopendridæ_ retain it.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. The _form_ of insects is so variable, that it can be reduced to\r\nno other general rules--than that, for the most part, the length\r\nexceeds the breadth, and the breadth the depth, and that the upper\r\nsurface is usually convex. But to these rules there are numerous\r\nexceptions. Thus many _Tetyræ_ F. (_Scutellera_ Latr.), a kind of\r\nbug, are as broad as they are long[1154]; in the genus _Gonyleptes_\r\nK.[1155] amongst the _Aptera_, and _Epeira cancriformis_, a\r\ncrab-shaped spider, the breadth exceeds the length; in _Cynips_, and\r\nseveral other _Hymenoptera_, in _Acrida_ K.[1156] (_Locusta_ F.), and\r\nother Orthopterous insects, the depth exceeds the breadth; and in\r\nthat singular beetle, _Eurychora_; the cockroach (_Blatta_), &c. the\r\nupper surface is flat.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. The _sculpture_ of the integument of insects is often very\r\nremarkable; but as this will call for attention hereafter, I shall\r\nonly here observe in general, that ornament and variety seem not to\r\nbe the sole object of those elevations and depressions which form so\r\nprominent a feature of many of the animals in question; for by means\r\nof these, many important purposes, that at first sight do not strike\r\nthe observer, may be served: such as giving firmness to the crust\r\nin those places where it is most wanted; diminishing its powers of\r\nresistance in others, so that it may yield somewhat to the action of\r\nthe muscles; increasing or deducting from the weight of the body,\r\nso as to produce a proper equipoise during its motions, whether on\r\nthe earth, in the air, or in the water. The depressions of the outer\r\nsurface of the crust, in many instances, produce an elevation of\r\nit in the interior, and so afford a useful point of attachment to\r\ncertain muscles. This observation seems more especially applicable\r\nto those excavations that are common to particular tribes or genera:\r\nthus the dorsal longitudinal channel to be met with on the prothorax\r\nof most of the _Carabi_ of Linné on the inside of the crust have a\r\ncorresponding ridge. In _Locusta Dux_, also, (a Brazil locust,) the\r\nsame part has _four_ transverse channels, corresponding with which\r\non the inside are as many _septa_, or ridges, to which muscles are\r\nattached; and those larger impressed puncta denominated _puncta\r\nordinaria_, which distinguish the same part in _Geotrupes_ and many\r\nof the _Scarabæidæ_, within are elevated, so as to form a kind of\r\nginglymous articulation with the base of the anterior coxæ. The\r\nother impressed puncta so often to be seen on the different parts\r\nof various insects, which sometimes so intirely cover the surface\r\nthat scarcely any interval is discoverable between them, though in\r\nmany cases they appear to be mere impressions that attenuate but\r\ndo not perforate the crust--yet in others, perhaps equally or more\r\nnumerous, they are real _pores_, which pass through the integument.\r\nIf, for instance, you take the thoracic shield of the cockchafer\r\n(_Melolontha vulgaris_), and after removing the muscle &c., hold it\r\nagainst the light, with the inner side towards the eye, you will see\r\nthe light through every puncture: or take the elytra of _Geotrupes\r\nstercorarius_, or any common beetle in which these organs have\r\npunctate striæ, and examine them under a lens on the inside, and you\r\nwill see distinctly that the punctures pass through the elytrum, and\r\nthe membrane that lines it[1157]. It is not improbable that in the\r\ncase last mentioned these pores may be of use, as the spiracles are\r\nusually closely covered by the elytra, for the better transmission of\r\nthe air to those respiratory organs. Whether the pores in the other\r\nparts of the body are for transpiration, is more than I shall venture\r\nto affirm; but as insects sometimes perspire, at least this has been\r\nascertained with respect to the hive-bee[1158], this must be by the\r\nmeans of some pores.\r\n\r\n\r\niv. The integument of insects is often clothed, either partially or\r\ngenerally, with _pubescence_, or hairs of various kinds--a circumstance\r\nwhich seems to have more than one object. In _Parnus_, _Heterocerus_,\r\n_Gerris_, _Argyroneta aquatica_, and some other aquatic insects, the\r\nend in view seems to be to keep the water from wetting the crust; and\r\nin this case the covering of hairs is dense, silky, and decumbent.\r\nAnother object is preventing friction from being injurious: thus\r\nhumble-bees, that from their mode of nidification[1159], are usually\r\nmore particularly exposed to it, are well clothed with hair; and in\r\nthose articulations of insects where much friction takes place, we may\r\noften observe a dense fringe or coating of the same substance. This\r\nyou may see in the common stag-beetle (_Lucanus Cervus_), where the\r\nthorax receives the head; and very remarkably at the same point in the\r\nHercules-beetle (_Dynastes Hercules_ MacLeay): but besides these uses,\r\nthere is probably one more universal, which will apply as well to those\r\nthinly scattered bristles and hairs, here and there one, to be noticed\r\nin many insects: but concerning this I can only throw out a conjecture,\r\nas I do not recollect ever to have seen any experiments with regard to\r\nthis use of animal hairs. But may they not act as conductors, either to\r\nintroduce some invisible fluid into the body in a positive state, or to\r\nconvey it out, when received by other means, in a negative state? Every\r\none knows that the fur of a cat has electric properties, and there may\r\nbe an important general use of this kind attached to the fur and hairs\r\nof animals[1160]. But, as I said, I give this as a mere conjecture;\r\nand only wish it may excite your attention to the subject, and put in\r\nexercise your natural tact for experiment.\r\n\r\nM. Cuvier regards the hairs of insects as merely a continuation of\r\nthe epidermis, with which they fall when the animal changes its\r\nskin[1161]; but this will apply only to the hairs of larvæ: for the\r\nhairs of perfect insects in many cases are implanted in a pore, and\r\npass through epidermis or crust to the membrane that lines it, in\r\nwhich they terminate.\r\n\r\n\r\nv. We are now to consider the _composition_ of the integument; under\r\nwhich term I would include the different layers of which it consists,\r\nand its articulation.\r\n\r\n1. With respect to the _first_ of these circumstances, the\r\n_layers_ of which the integument consists, it seems to exhibit\r\nsome, although not an exact, analogy with the _skin_, rather than\r\nthe _skeleton_, of the vertebrate animals[1162]. In these last, the\r\nskin is stated to consist of _four_ layers. Of these the exterior\r\none is the _epidermis_, or scarf-skin: under this is the _rete\r\nmucosum_, or mucous tissue, which gives its colour to the skin; next\r\nfollows the _papillary tissue_ formed by the extremities of the\r\nnerves, and in which the sense of _touch_ principally resides; the\r\nlast and innermost layer is the _skin proper_, or leather, called\r\n_Dermis_, _Derma_, or _Corium_[1163]. _Two_ of these layers M.\r\nCuvier assigns to insects. They have, he observes, in every state,\r\na true _epidermis_[1164]; and in their state of larva he finds\r\nthat the infinite variety of colours that so adorn many of them is\r\nproduced by a mucous substance observable between the epidermis\r\nand the muscles[1165]: this seems analogous to the _rete mucosum_.\r\nTo this, dried and mixed with their horny substance, he attributes\r\nalso the colours of the perfect insect: \"for,\" says he, \"when the\r\n_Lepidoptera_ are in the chrysalis, the little coloured scales\r\nwhich are to ornament their wings, are then in a state of mucosity\r\nsimilar to that which is found under the skin of the caterpillar.\r\nThe colours of the _Arachnida_,\" he goes on, \"are also due to this\r\nmucosity: it is discoverable under the skin, and has the appearance\r\nof minute glandular points of which the shades vary considerably.\r\nBut in the _Coleoptera_, and many other Orders, the colours of the\r\nskin are mixed in its horny tissue, nearly as those of the _Testacea_\r\nare in their calcareous shells\"[1166]. In the perfect insects,\r\ntherefore, in most cases, we may consider the _epidermis_ and _rete\r\nmucosum_ as together forming the exterior and coloured integument of\r\ninsects--that part which in the table, since it is not properly an\r\n_epidermis_, I have distinguished by the name of _Exoderma_.\r\n\r\nThe learned author just quoted has observed nothing under the skin\r\nof white-blooded animals that he regards as analogous to _nervous\r\npapillæ_[1167]. In some parts of insects, as in the lamellæ of the\r\nantennæ of the _Petalocera_, and the extremities of the joints,\r\nespecially the last, of many palpi, there is however an appearance\r\nof them; and it seems reasonable to suppose that where the sense\r\nof _touch_ resides, there must, even in insects, be something of a\r\n_papillary tissue_.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the innermost integument of the vertebrate animals,--the\r\n_leather_, or real skin,--this learned comparative anatomist finds\r\nnothing analogous to it in the integuments of insects[1168]; but as he\r\ndoes not notice it, he appears to have overlooked the substance that\r\nlines the outer crust, or _exoderma_, in the _Coleoptera_ and most\r\nother orders. This is not always easily detected; but it may generally\r\nbe discovered by breaking, or rather tearing (not cutting), after\r\nhaving cleared away the muscles, any part of the body of an insect.\r\nIt is always very visible on the under side of _elytra_[1169], but is\r\nnot discoverable in _tegmina_. It appears to consist, in many cases,\r\nof several layers of a whitish membrane, and generally breaks into\r\nfibres. In some elytra of the larger _Dynastidæ_, towards the sides\r\nthe exterior layer is separated from the rest by a kind of cellular\r\nsubstance. The fibrous structure of this inner skin (which I call the\r\n_Esoderma_) seems to give it some affinity to the skin of vertebrate\r\nanimals[1170]. In many parts of the body, however, it appears to be\r\nmerely a thin pellicle. A medical friend, to whom I showed specimens of\r\nit, thinks it a kind of cellular membrane.\r\n\r\n2. A few words are next necessary with regard to the _articulation_\r\nof the integument, or the mode by which the several pieces of which\r\nit and its members consist, are united to each other. In some, as\r\nin several of the parts of the head, the occiput, vertex, temples,\r\ncheeks, &c.--the line of distinction is merely imaginary; in others\r\nan impressed line separates a part from its neighbours, as is the\r\ncase with the _nose_ in _Vespa_, &c. the head in the _Arachnida_. But\r\nin the majority of instances the parts are separated by a suture, or\r\nform a real joint. The kinds of articulation observed by anatomists\r\nin vertebrate animals do not all occur in insects, and they seem to\r\nhave some peculiar to themselves. Thus, for instance, they have no\r\nproper _suture_; for though they exhibit the appearance both of the\r\n_harmonic_ and _squamose_ (_ecailleuse_ Cuv.) sutures[1171], yet\r\nthese parts being all limited by the _esoderma_, or skin, above\r\nnoticed as lining the integument, and all admitting a degree of\r\nmotion more or less intense, rather afford examples, as the case\r\nmay be, of other kinds of articulation[1172]. Again, they have no\r\nproper _Enarthrosis_, or ball and socket; though the anterior coxæ\r\nof the Capricorn-beetles (_Cerambyx_ L.) approach very near to this\r\nkind of articulation, as will be shown more fully in another place.\r\nThe inosculating segments or rings, which distinguish the abdomen,\r\nand sometimes other parts of insects, are an example of a kind of\r\narticulation not to be met with in the _Vertebrata_. The ginglymous\r\narticulation, in which the prominences of the ends of two joints\r\nare mutually received by their cavities, and which admits only of\r\nflexion and extension, often prevails in the limbs, &c. of insects;\r\nbut in many cases the joints are merely suspended to each other by a\r\nligament or membrane; and, in fact, the integument of insects, with\r\nregard to its articulation, even where the joints ginglymate, may\r\nbe said in general to consist of pieces connected by the internal\r\nligament, membrane, or skin that lines it; for even in the legs,\r\nwhere the ginglymous articulation is sometimes very remarkable and\r\ncomplex, as will be shown to you hereafter, the joints are also\r\nconnected by this substance, as you may see if you examine the legs\r\nof any Coleopterous insect.\r\n\r\nThe _number_ of articulations or pieces that form the integument and\r\nits members in these animals, varies greatly in different tribes,\r\ngenera, &c. Thus, in the common louse (_Pediculus humanus_) they\r\nscarcely reach fifty, while in some cockroaches (_Blatta_) they\r\namount to more than eight times that number.\r\n\r\nHaving premised these observations on the external anatomy of the\r\nbody in general, in the remainder of the present letter I shall\r\nconfine myself to the consideration of the _head_ and its _parts_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The _Head_ of insects, as the principal seat of the organs of\r\nsensation, must be regarded in them, as well as in the vertebrate\r\nanimals, as the _governing_ part of the body. It may be considered with\r\nrespect to its _substance_, _figure_, _composition_, _superficies_,\r\n_proportion_, _direction_, _articulation_ with the _trunk_,\r\n_motions_--and more particularly as to its _parts_ and _appendages_.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. With regard to its _substance_--the head may be said in general\r\nto be the _hardest_ part of the crust: and it is so for very good\r\nreasons. In the first place, as it has to make way for the rest of\r\nthe body when the animal moves, it is thereby best fitted to overcome\r\nsuch resistance as may be opposed by the medium through which it has\r\nto pass; in the next, as it bears the organs of manducation, it was\r\nrequisite that it should be sufficiently firm and solid to support\r\ntheir action, which is often upon very hard substances; and besides\r\nthis, as no motion of its parts _inter se_, as in the case of the\r\ntrunk, is requisite to facilitate the play of its organs, a thin\r\nintegument was not wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\nii. The most general law relative to the _figure_ or shape of the\r\nhead seems to be, that it should approach to that of an equilateral\r\ntriangle, with its angles rounded, and the vertex being the mouth;\r\nand that the vertical diameter should be less than the horizontal,\r\nwhether longitudinal or transverse. But the infractions of this\r\nlaw are numerous and various. Thus, in some insects an isosceles\r\ntriangle is represented by the head, the length being greater than\r\nthe breadth; in others, instead of being flat it is compressed, so\r\nthat the horizontal diameter is less than the vertical; in others,\r\nagain, it is orbicular, or round and depressed; in others nearly\r\nspherical: occasionally it is rather cylindrical. In many instances\r\nit is very long; in others the width exceeds the length. Though often\r\nnarrowest before, in some cases the reverse takes place. Its anterior\r\nend is often attenuated into a long or short snout or rostrum, and\r\nits posterior into a long or short neck. Its contour, though usually\r\nregular, is sometimes either cut into lobes, or scooped out into\r\nsinuosities. But to enumerate minutely all the variations of form\r\nwhich take place in the head of insects would be endless; I shall\r\ntherefore proceed to the next particular.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. The _composition_ of the head is very simple; for, exclusive\r\nof its organs, it consists only of a single piece or box, without\r\nsuture or segment, with an aperture at the end below to receive the\r\ninstruments of manducation, others for the eyes and stemmata when\r\npresent, and also for the antennæ. In the _Arachnida_, &c., in which\r\nthe head is not separated from the thorax, it is merely a plate, the\r\nunder-side or cavity of which is occupied and filled by the above\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n\r\niv. With regard to its _superficies_, the head of insects is generally\r\nmore or less uneven, though in some cases it presents no inequalities.\r\nIn many of the Lamellicorn tribes, and a few other individuals, in\r\none sex at least, as has been before observed[1173], it is armed with\r\nlong horns, or prominent tubercles; it is often covered with numerous\r\npuncta, or pores; and some of its parts, as the nose, after-nose, &c.\r\nin particular groups, marked out by an impressed line[1174]. In many\r\n_Hymenoptera_, _Diptera_, &c. its upper surface is convex, and the\r\nlower concave; in others both surfaces are convex.\r\n\r\n\r\nv. It is the most general rule, as to its _proportion_, that it shall\r\nbe smaller than either trunk or abdomen; but in some instances, as in\r\nthe S. American ant, _Atta megacephala_, it is much larger than either.\r\n\r\n\r\nvi. By the _direction_ of the head, I mean its inclination with\r\nrespect to the prothorax. The most natural direction, or that\r\nwhich obtains most generally, is for it to form an angle more or\r\nless obtuse with the part just mentioned. This seems to obtain\r\nparticularly in _Coleoptera_; but in some, as _Mylabris_, it is\r\ninflexed, forming an acute angle with it. In the Heteropterous\r\n_Hemiptera_ (_Cimex_ L. &c.) it is generally in the same line with\r\nthe body, or horizontal; and in many _Diptera_ it is vertical.\r\n\r\n\r\nvii. We now come to a circumstance which will detain us longer,\r\nnamely, its _articulation with the trunk_, or rather with its anterior\r\nsegment, the _prothorax_.--M. Cuvier makes _two_ principal kinds of\r\narticulation of the head upon the prothorax, in one of which the points\r\nof contact are solid, and the movement subordinate to the configuration\r\nof the parts; in the other, the articulation is ligamentous, the head\r\nand the thorax being united and kept together by membranes.\r\n\r\n1. The _first_ of these kinds of articulation--that by the contact\r\nof solid parts--takes place, he says, in _four_ different ways.\r\n\"In the most common conformation, in the part that corresponds\r\nto the neck, the head bears one or two smooth tubercles, which\r\nreceive corresponding cavities of the anterior part of the prothorax\r\nobservable in the Lamellicorn and Capricorn beetles. In this case\r\nthe head can move backwards, and the mouth forwards and downwards.\r\nThe _second_ mode of solid articulation takes place when the\r\nposterior part of the head is rounded, and turns upon its axis in a\r\ncorresponding cavity of the anterior part of the prothorax; as may\r\nbe seen in _Curculio_, _Reduvius_, &c. The axis of motion is then\r\nat the centre of articulation, and the mouth of the insect moves\r\nequally backwards and forwards, upwards and downwards, to right and\r\nleft.--The _third_ sort of articulation, by solid surfaces, takes\r\nplace when the head, truncated posteriorly, and presenting a flat\r\nsurface, is articulated, sometimes upon a tubercle of the thorax,\r\nand sometimes upon another flat and corresponding surface, as in\r\nalmost all the _Hymenoptera_ and the majority of the _Diptera_. The\r\ndisposition of the _fourth_ kind of articulation allows the head only\r\nthe movement of the angular hinge (_le seul mouvement de charnière\r\nangulaire_). The only examples at present known are in some species\r\nof _Attelabus_ F. The head of these insects terminates behind in a\r\nround tubercle, received in a corresponding cavity of the thorax: the\r\nlower margin of this cavity has a notch, and permits the movement of\r\nthe head only in one direction[1175].\"\r\n\r\n2. The _second_ kind of articulation, the ligamentous, he affirms takes\r\nplace only in _orthopterous_ and some _neuropterous_ insects: \"The head\r\nin this kind of articulation is only impeded in its movements towards\r\nthe back, because it is stopped there by the advance of the prothorax;\r\nbut below it is quite free. The membranes or ligaments extend from the\r\ncircuit of the occipital cavity to that of the anterior part of the\r\nprothorax, which gives a great extent to the movement[1176].\"\r\n\r\nWhen I consider the well-deserved celebrity of the great author whose\r\nwords I have here quoted, and the great and useful light that the\r\ngenius and learning which conducted his patient labours and researches\r\nhave thrown over every department of comparative anatomy,--a science he\r\nmay be almost said to have founded,--I feel the most intire reluctance\r\nto differ in any thing from an authority so justly venerable to all\r\nlovers of that interesting study. But, however great my diffidence and\r\nhesitation to express an opinion at all opposed to his, the interests\r\nof truth and science require that I should state those particulars in\r\nwhich my own observations, made upon a careful examination of various\r\ninsects of every Order, have led to results in some respects different\r\nfrom the above. \"_Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus_;\" and if the\r\nGenius of Comparative Anatomy ever nodded, it sometimes happened when\r\nhe was examining the structure of insects. An instance of this with\r\nregard to the mouth of the bee has been noticed by Mr. Savigny[1177];\r\nand indeed it is not wonderful that in so extensive an undertaking, in\r\nwhich the number of examples to be examined upon every branch of his\r\nsubject must be immense, that he did not always scrutinize minutely\r\nthose that seemed less important. Every writer on every department\r\nof Natural History, especially where the objects of research, as in\r\nthe insect world, are so infinite in number, will be liable to such\r\nmistakes; but these will meet with due allowance from every candid\r\nmind--\r\n\r\n          \"Hanc veniam damus, petimusque vicissim:\"\r\n\r\nand I shall express my trust that you will overlook any errors of\r\nmine; and doubtless I shall not be free from them--\r\n\r\n          \"---------Quas aut incuria fudit,\r\n           Aut humana parum cavit natura----\"\r\n\r\nThe two kinds of articulation of the head which our learned author\r\nhas stated as the principal ones, will, I think, be found upon\r\nexamination not so widely distant as his expressions seem to\r\nindicate; for in fact in all insects, as well as the _Orthoptera_,\r\nthis part is _suspended_ by a membrane or ligament which unites\r\nthe margins of the occipital cavity with those of the anterior one\r\nof the prothorax: thus forming all round some protection to the\r\norgans that are transmitted from the head through the latter part to\r\nthe rest of the body. Though the head in most _Orthoptera_ is not\r\npartly received into the cavity of the prothorax, as is the case in\r\nthe Order _Coleoptera_, but is rather suspended to it, yet in some\r\ninstances, for example in the mole-cricket (_Gryllotalpa vulgaris_),\r\nit is partially inserted.\r\n\r\nAgain: when, in his _first_ mode of articulation by contact of solid\r\nparts, he speaks of one or two smooth tubercles of the neck, with\r\ntheir corresponding cavities in the prothorax, as forming the most\r\ncommon conformation, you would expect to find examples of this in\r\nvery many insects; yet upon a close examination, unless in _Oryctes\r\nnasicornis_[1178], and perhaps in others of the _Dynastidæ_ MacLeay,\r\nyou would scarcely meet with any thing that could be called a\r\ntubercle and its corresponding cavity in the neck or prothorax of any\r\nLamellicorn or Capricorn beetle that you might chance to examine.\r\nYou would find, indeed, that the occiput was usually smooth and very\r\nslippery, as if lubricated; that in its margin were one or two notches\r\n(_Myoglyphides_), with muscles attached to them; that in the former of\r\nthese tribes, the _Lamellicorns_, it projected on each side so as to\r\nform a more or less prominent angle; and that the throat (_jugulum_)\r\nwas very convex, and lodged in a cavity of the lower margin of the\r\nprothorax: but further appearances of tubercles &c. you would in vain\r\nlook for even in this tribe; and in the _Capricorns_ you would find\r\nthat the general conformation in this respect belonged to our learned\r\nauthor's _second_ mode of solid articulation, resembling that of the\r\nmajority of the weevils (_Curculio_ L.), in which the head has no\r\nprojecting angles or tubercles, or other elevation, but is received\r\nusually into the circular cavity of the prothorax.\r\n\r\nHis _third_ mode of this articulation, that of the _Hymenoptera_\r\nand _Diptera_, is so peculiar, that it ought to be considered as a\r\n_primary_ kind; since in this the head moves _upon_ the prothorax as\r\nupon a pivot, and has a kind of versatile motion.\r\n\r\nWith regard to his _fourth_ mode, which from his description appears\r\nto be that of _Apoderus_ Oliv., he allows motion to the head only in\r\n_one_ direction, observing that the lower margin of the prothoracic\r\ncavity has a notch. But M. Latreille calls the articulation of the\r\nhead in this genus an _Enarthrosis_[1179], which admits motion in\r\nevery direction; and if you examine the common species (_A. Coryli_),\r\nyou will find that the prothorax has a sinus taken out of its upper\r\nmargin, as well as out of its lower one--which at any rate will allow\r\na motion _upwards_.\r\n\r\nI merely mention these little inaccuracies, with due diffidence,\r\nas some apology for giving you a different and at least a more\r\npopular and general view of this part of my subject, which I shall\r\nnow proceed to state to you. It seems to me most convenient for the\r\nEntomologist, and most consonant to nature, to divide insects, with\r\nrespect to the articulation of the head with the trunk, into three\r\n_primary_ sections, each admitting one or more subdivisions.\r\n\r\n1. The _first_ consists of those whose head inosculates more or less in\r\nthe anterior cavity of the chest; and whose articulation, therefore,\r\nseems to partake in a greater or less degree of the ball and socket\r\n(_Enarthrosis_). The head, however, is often capable of being protruded\r\nfrom this cavity. If you take into your hand any common _Harpalus_\r\nthat you may find under a stone, you will see, if pressed, that it\r\ncan shoot forth its head, so as to be entirely disengaged from the\r\nprothorax: a neck of ligament intervening between them[1180]: of course\r\nthis power of protruding the head enables the animal to disengage\r\nit at its will from the restriction imposed upon its motions by the\r\nsurrounding margin of the prothoracic cavity. To this section belong\r\nall the _Coleoptera_, the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_ (_Cimex_ L., &c.),\r\nand some of the _Neuroptera_ (_Raphidia_, _Semblis_, &c.).--It may\r\nbe further divided into _two_ subsections--those, namely, whose head\r\ninosculates in the prothorax by means of a _neck_: as for instance\r\nLatreille's _Trachelides_, _Apoderus_, and the _Staphylinidæ_, amongst\r\nthe beetles; the _Reduviadæ_ amongst the _Heteropterous_ insects, and\r\n_Raphidia_ in the _Neuroptera_; and those whose head inosculates in the\r\nprothorax without the intervention of a neck; as, the _Petalocera_,\r\nthe aquatic beetles (_Dytiscus_, _Hydrophilus_, &c.), and most of the\r\ngenus _Curculio_ L. in the first of these orders, the great body of the\r\n_Cimicidæ_ in the second, and _Semblis_, _Corydalis_, &c. in the third.\r\n\r\n2. The _second_ section consists of those insects whose head does not\r\ninosculate in the chest, but is merely suspended to it by ligament or\r\nmembrane. To this belong most of the tribes of the _Orthoptera_ Order,\r\nwith the exception of the _Mantidæ_, the _Dermaptera_, the _Homopterous\r\nHemiptera_, and such of the _Aptera_ as have the head distinct from\r\nthe prothorax.--This section admits of a _triple_ subdivision: those,\r\nnamely, whose head is _wholly_ covered by the shield of the prothorax,\r\nas in _Blatta_ L.; those whose head is _partly_ covered by it, as\r\n_Gryllotalpa_, and other _Gryllina_; and those whose head is quite\r\nfree, not being at all impeded in its motion by the prothorax, as the\r\n_Dermaptera_, _Nirmus_, _Pediculus_, &c.\r\n\r\n3. The _third_ section consists of those whose head is truncated\r\nposteriorly, and flat or concave, with a very small occipital\r\naperture, and is attached to a neck of the prothorax upon which\r\nit turns, or is merely suspended to that part. This includes\r\nthe _Lepidoptera_, _Hymenoptera_, _Diptera_, the _Libellulina_,\r\n&c. in the _Neuroptera_, and the _Mantidæ_ in the _Orthoptera_.\r\n_Three_ subsections at least, if not more, present themselves in\r\nthis section: the first is, of those whose head is united to the\r\nprothorax, without the latter forming any _neck_. To this belong the\r\n_Lepidoptera_, _Trichoptera_? The _second_ is of those the upper\r\nside of whose thoracic neck is _ligamentous_; and here you may range\r\nmost of the _Hymenoptera_. The _third_ is of those in whom it is a\r\n_continuation_ of the ordinary _integument_. In this subsection the\r\n_Diptera_, _Libellulina_ and _Mantidæ_ will find their place. In this\r\nlast section the head appears to turn upon the thorax as upon a pivot.\r\n\r\nBefore I finish what I have to say on the _articulation_ of the\r\nhead, I must direct your attention to the _analogies_ that hold in\r\nthis respect between the different tribes. Thus the _Coleoptera_\r\nare analogous to the _Heteropterous Hemiptera_; the _Orthoptera_,\r\nwith the exception of the _Mantidæ_, to the _Homopterous Hemiptera_;\r\nthe _Mantidæ_ to the _Libellulina_; the _Lepidoptera_ to the\r\n_Trichoptera_; the _Hymenoptera_ to the _Diptera_, with a slight\r\nvariation, and probably others might be traced.\r\n\r\n\r\nviii. A word or two upon the _motions_ of which the head of insects\r\nis capable. M. Cuvier, in the extracts lately laid before you,\r\nspeaks of different powers of movement as the result of different\r\nconfigurations of the parts of the head. This probably is correct\r\nwith regard to many cases; but a great deal will depend upon the\r\npower the insect has of protruding its head and disengaging its base\r\nfrom the restriction of the prothorax; for where, like the _Harpali_,\r\n_Staphylini_, &c. it is able to do this, it can probably move its\r\nhead in every direction. It is only where the ligaments are less\r\nelastic, or allow of little tension, that its movements are confined;\r\nand few living insects have been sufficiently examined to ascertain\r\nhow far this takes place. In those cases belonging to the _third_\r\nsection of articulations, in which the head moves _upon_ the thorax\r\nas upon a pivot, as is the case with _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_,\r\nthe movement is nearly versatile. I have seen a fly turn its head\r\ncompletely round, so that the mouth became supine and the vertex\r\nprone; and from the form and fixing of the head, it should seem that\r\nthose of the _Mantidæ_ were endued with the same faculty.\r\n\r\n\r\nix. The _parts_ and _appendages_ of the head are now in the last\r\nplace to be considered. I shall begin with the _Mouth_, or rather\r\nthe orifice in which the _trophi_ or organs of manducation are\r\ninserted. In some insects, as was before observed, they occupy all\r\nthe under-side of the head, as in the _Arachnida_, _Myriapoda_,\r\n&c; but in the great majority they fill an orifice in its anterior\r\npart, which in some instances, as in _Lampyris_, the _Lepidoptera_,\r\n_Cimex_ L., _Truxalis_, appears to be nearly under the head; but in\r\ngeneral it terminates that part, though it extends further below than\r\nabove. In _Chermes_, a Homopterous genus, the promuscis is stated\r\nto be in the _Antepectus_, and consequently the _mouth_; but, as I\r\nshall endeavour to prove to you hereafter, this is a fallacy. In the\r\nmales of the species of _Coccus_ there is no mouth at all. In that\r\nof the elm (_C. Ulmi_) in lieu there are ten little shining points,\r\narranged two before and two behind in a line, and three on each side\r\nin a triangle[1181]. It is to be observed that the orifice of which\r\nI am speaking is usually much smaller in those insects which take\r\ntheir food by suction, the _Hemiptera_, _Lepidoptera_, _Diptera_,\r\n&c., than in the masticating tribes. With regard to the real mouth,\r\nor that through which the food enters, I have nothing at present to\r\nobserve, except that it lies between the upper-lip and tongue, is\r\nsometimes covered by a valve, as in _Apis_, _Vespa_[1182], &c., and\r\nis different in the masticators and suckers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall next offer a few observations _seriatim_, as they stand\r\nin the Table, upon the organs of manducation; which, to avoid\r\ncircumlocution, instead of _Instrumenta cibaria_, the name Fabricius\r\ngave them, I shall call _trophi_ or _feeders_. It is upon these\r\nparts, you are aware, that the system of the celebrated Entomologist\r\njust mentioned is founded; and could they always, or even for the\r\nmost part, be inspected with ease, they would no doubt afford\r\ncharacters as various and discriminative as those of the vertebrate\r\nanimals. Differences in these parts indicate a difference in the\r\nmode in which the animal takes its food, and often in the kind of\r\nfood, and sometimes in its general economy and habits,--circumstances\r\nwhich are powerful and weighty in supporting the claim of any set\r\nof animals to be considered as forming a natural genus or group.\r\nTrifling variations, however, of these parts, unless supported by\r\nother characters and qualities, ought not to have much stress laid\r\nupon them, since, if we insist upon these, in some tribes almost\r\nevery species might be made a genus.\r\n\r\nWith respect to their _trophi_ in general, insects of late have been\r\ndivided into two great tribes[1183], _masticators_ and _suckers_;\r\nthe _first_ including those that are furnished with instruments to\r\nseparate and _masticate_ their food; namely, an upper- and under-lip\r\n(_labrum_ and _labium_), upper- and under-jaws (_mandibulæ_ and\r\n_maxillæ_), labial and maxillary palpi, and a tongue (_lingua_): and\r\nthe _second_ those in which these parts are replaced by an articulate\r\nor exarticulate machine, consisting of several parts and pieces\r\nanalogous to the above, which pierce the food of the animal, and\r\nform a tube by which it _sucks_ its juices. If, however, the mode in\r\nwhich insects take their food be strictly considered, it will be\r\nfound that in this view they ought rather to be regarded as forming\r\n_three_ tribes; for the great majority of the _Hymenoptera_ order,\r\nand perhaps some others, though furnished with mandibles and maxillæ,\r\nnever use them for mastication, but really lap their food with their\r\ntongue: these, therefore, might be denominated _lappers_.\r\n\r\nWhen a mouth is furnished with the _seven_ ordinary organs used in\r\ntaking the food and preparing it for deglutition--I mean the upper-lip\r\nand the two upper-jaws; the under-lip and the two under-jaws, including\r\nthe labial and maxillary palpi; and the tongue--I denominate it a\r\n_perfect mouth_; but when it is deficient in any of these organs, or\r\nthey exist merely as rudiments, or when their place is supplied by\r\nothers, (which, though they may be analogous parts, have little or no\r\nconnection with them in their use or structure,) I denominate it an\r\n_imperfect mouth_. This last I would further distinguish, according to\r\nthe nature of its _trophi_, by other and more distinctive terms, as I\r\nshall presently explain to you.\r\n\r\n1. _Labrum_[1184].--I shall first consider the organs present in\r\na _perfect mouth_, beginning with the _upper-lip_ (_labrum_).\r\nThis part, which Fabricius sometimes confounded with the _nose_,\r\nmiscalling it _clypeus_, is usually a moveable[1185] piece, attached\r\nby its base to the anterior margin of the part last named, and\r\ncovering the mouth, and sometimes the mandibles, from above. In\r\ninsects in their last state it is usually of a horny or shelly\r\n_substance_; yet in some cases, as in _Copris_ and _Cetonia_, beetles\r\nthat imbibe juices, it is membranous. In _form_ and shape it varies\r\ngreatly, being sometimes nearly square, at others almost round; in\r\nsome insects representing a parallelogram, in others a triangle, and\r\nin many it is oblong. In some instances it is long and narrow, but\r\nmore generally short and wide. It is often large, but occasionally\r\nvery minute. In the majority it has an intire _margin_, but it is\r\nnot seldom emarginate or bilobed, or even dentate. Its _surface_\r\nis commonly even, but it is sometimes uneven, sometimes flat, at\r\nothers convex, and in a few species armed with a short horn or\r\ntubercle[1186]. As to its _pubescence_, it is often naked, but now\r\nand then fringed or clothed with down or hairs, or sprinkled with\r\nbristles. It consists in almost every instance of a single piece;\r\nbut an exception to this occurs in _Halictus_, a little bee, in the\r\nfemales of which it is furnished with a slender appendage[1187].--The\r\n_direction_ of the upper-lip is various. It is rarely horizontal, or\r\nin the same line with the nose, often vertical; it sometimes forms an\r\nobtuse angle with the anterior part of the head, and occasionally an\r\nacute one, when it is more or less inflexed. The _use_ of this part\r\nis ordinarily to close the mouth from above, to assist in retaining\r\nthe food while undergoing the process of mastication; but in many\r\nHymenopterous insects its principal use seems to be, to keep the\r\n_trophi_ properly folded; and in some cases where it is inflexed,\r\nas in the leaf-cutter bees (_Megachile_ Latr.), to defend its base,\r\nwhile the mandibles are employed, from injury by their action[1188].\r\n\r\n2. _Labium_[1189].--On the under-side of the head, and opposed\r\nto the upper-lip, the mouth is closed by another moveable organ,\r\nconcerning the nomenclature and analogies of which Entomologists\r\nhave differed considerably. At the first view of it, this organ\r\nseems a very complex machine, since the under-jaws or _maxillæ_ are\r\nattached to it on each side, and the tongue is often seen to emerge\r\nfrom it above, so as to appear merely a part of it; but as the\r\nformer answer to the upper-jaws, and the latter is the analogue of\r\nthe part bearing the same name in the vertebrate animals, I shall\r\nconsider these as distinct and _primary_ organs, and treat of the\r\nunder-lip (_labium_) of which I am now speaking, by itself. Linné\r\ntakes no notice of this part, but his illustrious compatriot and\r\ncotemporary, De Geer, did not so overlook it: he appears to consider\r\nthe whole apparatus, including the _maxillæ_, as the _labium_[1190];\r\nbut sometimes he distinguishes the middle piece by that name[1191];\r\nand the tongue, in the case of the stag-beetle, he denominates a\r\nproboscis (_trompe_)[1192]. In the _Hymenoptera_ he calls this part\r\n_tongue_, _under-lip_, and _proboscis_: but seems to prefer the\r\nlast term[1193]. Fabricius originally regarded the whole middle\r\npiece as a _labium_[1194]; but afterwards (though his definition\r\nis not accurate, since he assigns the _palpi_ to the _ligula_,\r\nwhich he affirms is covered by the _labium_--circumstances by no\r\nmeans universal in _Coleoptera_) he considers this as consisting\r\nof _ligula_ and _labium_[1195]. Latreille at first regarded the\r\n_ligula_ of Fabricius as the _labium_, and called the _labium_ of\r\nthat author the _mentum_[1196]; but afterwards he gave the name of\r\n_labium_ to the whole middle piece of the lower apparatus of the\r\nmouth--calling the upper piece, with Fabricius, the _ligula_, and\r\nretaining the denomination of _mentum_ for the lower[1197].\r\n\r\nIf the circumstances of the case are duly considered, I think you will\r\nbe convinced that the term under-lip, or _labium_, should be confined\r\nto that part which the learned Dane so named. For I would ask, Which\r\nis the part on the under side of the head that is the antagonist, if I\r\nmay so speak, of the upper-lip or _labrum_? Is it not that organ which,\r\nwhen the mouth is closed, meets that part, and in conjunction with it\r\nshuts all in? Now in numerous insects, particularly the Lamellicorn\r\nbeetles (_Scarabæus_ and _Lucanus_ L.), this is precisely the case. In\r\nthe Predaceous beetles, indeed, (_Cicindela_, _Carabus_, _Dytiscus_\r\nL. &c.) the under-lip does not meet the upper, to close the mouth and\r\nshut in the tongue; neither can the tongue be said so to do, but only,\r\nfrom some circumstances connected with its manner of taking its food,\r\nit is requisite that the last-mentioned organ should not be retractile\r\nor covered; but its miscalled _mentum_ is still the analogue of that\r\npart which helps to close the mouth in the former tribe. Should not\r\nthis, therefore, which so often performs the _office_, be distinguished\r\nby the _name_, of a lip? Again, is it not rather incongruous to\r\nconsider that organ which confessedly more or less performs the office\r\nof a _tongue_, as a part of the _lip_? Though it often wears that\r\nappearance, yet I believe, if the matter is thoroughly and patiently\r\ninvestigated, it will be found that on their upper side its roots are\r\nattached to the interior of the upper side of the head, as well as on\r\ntheir lower side to the _labium_; so that it may be regarded as common\r\nto the two lips, and therefore not properly considered as an appendage\r\nof the under-lip alone.\r\n\r\nHaving assigned my reasons for preferring the name given to the part\r\nin question by Fabricius, rather than that of Latreille, I shall next\r\nmake my observations on the part itself. In many cases the _labium_,\r\nor the middle piece of the lower oral apparatus, appears to consist of\r\n_two_ joints: this you may see in the great water-beetle (_Hydrophilus\r\npiceus_), the burying-beetles (_Necrophorus_), the Orthopterous\r\ntribes[1198], the _Hymenoptera_[1199], and others. In this case the\r\nupper or terminal piece is to be regarded as the _labium_, and the\r\nlower or basal one (which Mr. MacLeay calls the _stipes_) as the\r\n_mentum_ or chin--at other times, as in some Lamellicorn beetles, the\r\nonly separation is a transverse elevated line, or an obtuse angle\r\nformed by the meeting of the two parts, and very frequently there is no\r\nseparation at all, in which case the whole piece, the _mentum_ merging\r\nin it, may be denominated the _labium_.\r\n\r\nWith respect to its _substance_, the _labium_ in most Coleopterous\r\ninsects is hard and horny, in _Necrophorus_ it is membranous,\r\nand the _mentum_ harder; in _Prionus coriarius_, our largest\r\nCapricorn-beetle, both are membranous; in the bee-tribes, _Apis_\r\nL., the _labium_ rather resembles leather, while the _mentum_ is\r\nhard. Its _surface_ is often convex, sometimes plane, and sometimes\r\neven concave; as for instance in _Melolontha Fullo_, a rare chafer\r\noccasionally found on the coast of Kent. In some it is covered with\r\nexcavated points; in others it is quite smooth. In numbers, as in\r\nthe Predaceous beetles, both _labium_ and _mentum_ are perfectly\r\nnaked; in others, as in the common cockchafer, they are hairy;\r\nin _Geniates barbatus_ Kirby, another chafer in the male insect,\r\nthe _labium_ is naked, while the _mentum_, which forms a piece\r\ndistinct from that part, is covered with a dense rigid beard[1200].\r\nIn _shape_ the whole _labium_ varies considerably, much more than\r\nthe _labrum_; for in addition to most of the forms I enumerated\r\nwhen I described that organ, which I shall not here repeat, you\r\nmay meet with examples of many others. Thus, to instance in the\r\nPetalocerous tribes (_Scarabæus_ L.), in some, as in the _Rutelidæ_,\r\nthe _labium_ is urceolate, or representing in some degree the shape\r\nof a pitcher[1201]; in others it is deeply concave, and not a little\r\nresembles a basin or a bowl[1202]; this form is peculiar to the\r\n_labium_ of _Cremastocheilus_ Knoch, a scarce North American beetle;\r\nin another related to this, but of an African type (_Genuchus_ Kirby\r\nMS. _Cetonia cruenta_ F.), it is a trapezoid plate, which is elevated\r\nfrom the head, and hangs over the throat like a chin[1203]. In the\r\n_Hymenoptera_ it is extremely narrow and long, and embraces the sides\r\nof the tongue, as well as covering it from below; so that it wears\r\nthe appearance of a kind of tube[1204]. Generally speaking, the\r\nlength of the _labium_ exceeds its breadth; but in the Predaceous\r\nbeetles the reverse of this takes place, it being very short and\r\nwide, and usually terminating towards the tongue in three lobes or\r\nteeth which form two sinuses varying in depth[1205].\r\n\r\nThe _mentum_ taken by itself affords no very striking characters\r\nto which I need call your attention: I shall only observe, that\r\nin _Hymenoptera_ it is generally of a triangular shape[1206]; but\r\nbefore I proceed to consider the labial palpi, it will be proper to\r\nnotice the remarkable _labium_ of _Orthopterous_ insects, and of the\r\n_Libellulina_, between which there is no little analogy. At first you\r\nwould imagine the terminal part of this organ in the former to be the\r\nanalogue of the tongue, or _ligula_ F.; as it is indeed generally\r\nregarded by modern Entomologists[1207]. It seems, like the tongue of\r\nthe _Carabi_ L., _Dytisci_, &c., to be a distinct piece, which has\r\nbelow it both _labium_ and _mentum_; but when you look within the\r\nmouth, you will find a linguiform organ[1208], which evidently acts\r\nthe part of a tongue, and therefore ought to have the name; and the\r\npiece just alluded to must either be regarded as the termination of\r\nthe lip, or as an external accompaniment of the tongue, analogous,\r\nit may be, to the _paraglossæ_ in bees[1209]. In a specimen of\r\n_Acrida viridissima_ (_Locusta_ F.) which I dissected, the tongue is\r\nas long as the appendage of the under-lip, and by its upper surface\r\nseems to apply closely to it. In the _Libellulina_ a similar organ\r\nis discoverable[1210], which on its upper-side terminates in the\r\n_pharynx_, like that of one of the _Harpalidæ_ before mentioned. In\r\nthe _Orthoptera_, therefore, I regard the _labium_ as consisting\r\nof three articulations, the upper one divided into two, three, or\r\nmore lobes[1211]; the intermediate one more directly answering to\r\nthe _labium_ of other insects, and the basal one or _mentum_. This\r\norgan in the _Libellulina_ is of a different structure: it has only\r\ntwo articulations representing _labium_ and _mentum_; but the former\r\nconsists of three parallel pieces, the two exterior ones rising\r\nhigher than the intermediate one, and at their inner angle having an\r\nacute sinus from which the palpi emerge; and the intermediate piece,\r\nwhich is longitudinally channelled, lapping over the inner side of\r\nthe lateral pieces. From the angle of the covered part of these\r\npieces, a subulate short horizontal horn points inwards towards the\r\ntongue, which it must keep from closing with the _labium_[1212].\r\n\r\n3. _Palpi Labiales_[1213].--The last-mentioned organs, the _labial\r\npalpi_, next claim our attention; but before I advert particularly\r\nto them, it will be proper to premise a few words upon _palpi_, or\r\nfeelers, in general. These are usually jointed moveable organs,\r\nof a corneous or coriaceous substance, attached by ligaments to\r\nthe _labium_ and _maxillæ_, and in the _Crustacea_ even to the\r\n_mandibulæ_. Their joints, which are usually more or less obconical,\r\narticulate also in each other by ligaments, with perhaps some\r\nlittle mixture of the ball and socket. Their ends, the last joint\r\nespecially, seem furnished with nervous _papillæ_ which indicate some\r\npeculiar sense, of which they are the instrument. What that sense is\r\nhas not been clearly ascertained, and concerning which I shall enter\r\nmore into detail in another place. Their motion seems restrained, at\r\nleast in some, to two directions, towards and from the mouth. They\r\nwere called _palpi_ or feelers, because the insect has been supposed\r\nto use them in exploring substances. There seem to be no organs in\r\nthe vertebrate animals directly analogous to the _palpi_ of insects\r\nand _Crustacea_, unless, perhaps, the _cirri_ that emerge from the\r\nlips of some fishes, as the cod, red mullet, &c. which Linné defines\r\nas used in exploring (_prætentantes_). Whether the _vibrissæ_,\r\nmiscalled _smellers_, of some quadrupeds and birds have any reference\r\nto them, I will not venture to affirm; but the feline tribe evidently\r\nuse their bristles as explorers, and they are planted chiefly in the\r\nvicinity of the mouth.\r\n\r\nHaving made these general remarks, I shall now confine myself to the\r\n_labial palpi_. I call them _labial_ palpi, because that term is in\r\ngeneral use, and because in many cases they really do emerge from what\r\nI consider as the _labium_, as in most of the _chafers_; but they\r\nmight with equal propriety be denominated _lingual_ palpi, since they\r\nsometimes appear to emerge from the _tongue_ as in the stag-beetle\r\n(_Lucanus Cervus_). In some instances, as in the Predaceous beetles,\r\nthey seem to be common to both _labium_ and tongue, being attached\r\nat their base on the upper side to the former, and on the under side\r\nto the latter. As to their _situation_: they emerge from the _base_\r\nof the _labium_ in the locusts (_Locusta_ Leach)[1214]; from its\r\n_middle_ in _Hister maximus_[1215]; from its _summit_ in _Amblyterus_\r\nMacLeay[1216]; and from its lateral margin in _Dynastes_ MacLeay, &c.\r\nThey consist of from _one_ to _four_ joints; which, I believe, they\r\nnever exceed. They vary in _length_; though generally shorter than the\r\nmaxillary palpi, yet in the ferocious tiger-beetles (_Cicindela_ L.)\r\nthey equal them in length; and in the hive-bee and humble-bees, and\r\nmany other bees, they are considerably longer[1217]. The two first\r\njoints of these palpi, however, in these _bees_ are different in their\r\nstructure from the two last, being compressed and flat, or concave;\r\nand the two last joints, instead of articulating with the apex of the\r\nsecond, emerge from it below the apex: so that these two first joints\r\nseem rather elevators of the palpi than really parts of them[1218].\r\nWith respect to the relative _proportions_ of their joints to each\r\nother: in some cases the first joint is the longest and thickest,\r\nthe rest growing gradually shorter and smaller[1219]; in others, the\r\nsecond is the longest[1220]; in others, again, the third[1221], and\r\nsometimes the last[1222]; and often all are nearly of the same size\r\nand length[1223]. They are more commonly _naked_, but sometimes either\r\ngenerally or partially _hairy_. Thus in _Cicindela_, the last joint\r\nbut one is usually planted with long snow-white bristles in a double\r\nseries, while the rest of the joints have none; and in _Copris_ Latr.\r\nall of them are extremely hairy. In _shape_ they do not vary so much\r\nas the maxillary palpi, being most frequently filiform or subclavate,\r\nand sometimes setaceous; the last joint varies more in shape than the\r\nrest, and is often remarkably large, triangular, and shaped like the\r\nhead of a hatchet[1224]; and at others it resembles the moon in her\r\nfirst quarter[1225]. In the great dragon-fly, or _demoiselle_ if you\r\nprefer the gentler French name (_Æshna_ F.) the labial palpi, which\r\nare without any visible joints, are terminated by a minute mucro\r\nor point[1226]. With regard to their _direction_ and flexure, they\r\nfrequently, as in the instance just mentioned, turn towards each other,\r\nand lie horizontally upon the end of the _labium_. Sometimes, as in the\r\n_Cicindelidæ_, they appear to point towards the tail of the insect, the\r\nlast joint rising, and forming an angle with the rest of the feeler.\r\nIn other instances they diverge laterally from the _labium_, the last\r\njoint turning again towards it at a very obtuse angle.\r\n\r\n4. _Mandibulæ_[1227].--Having considered the analogues of the\r\n_lips_ in our little beings, I must next call your attention to the\r\nrepresentatives of the _jaws_. The vertebrate animals, you know,\r\nare mostly furnished with a single pair of jaws, one above and the\r\nother below, in which the teeth are planted and which have a vertical\r\nmotion. But insects are furnished with _two_ pair of jaws, a pair\r\nof upper-jaws and a pair of under-jaws, which have no teeth planted\r\nin them, and the motion of which is horizontal.--I shall begin\r\nwith an account of the upper-jaws. These by modern Entomologists,\r\nafter Fabricius, are denominated _mandibles_ (_mandibulæ_): a term\r\nappropriated by Linné to the beaks of birds. The upper-jaws of\r\ninsects this great naturalist named _maxillæ_--and not improperly,\r\nsince the office of mastication is more peculiarly their office than\r\nthat of the under-jaws, which Fabricius has distinguished by that\r\nname: as the term _mandible_, however, is generally adopted, I shall\r\nnot attempt to disturb it.\r\n\r\nThe _mandibles_ close the mouth on each side under the _labrum_ or\r\nupper-lip. They are generally powerful organs, of a hard _substance_\r\nlike horn; but in the Lamellicorn beetles of Mr. MacLeay's families\r\nof _Scarabæidæ_ and _Cetoniadæ_, they are soft, membranous, and unapt\r\nfor mastication. In Coleopterous insects they commonly _articulate_\r\nwith the head by means of certain _apophyses_ or processes, of\r\nwhich in many cases there are _three_ discoverable at the exterior\r\nbase of the mandibles; one, namely, at each angle, and one in the\r\nmiddle. That on the lower side is usually the most prominent, and\r\nwears the appearance of the condyle of a bone: it is received by\r\na corresponding deep socket (or cotyloid cavity) of the cheek, in\r\nwhich, being perfectly smooth and lubricous, it moves readily, but\r\nwithout _synovia_, like a _rotula_ in its _acetabulum_. The upper\r\none projects from the jaw, forms the segment of a circle, and is\r\nconcave also on its inner face. A corresponding more shallow, or,\r\nas anatomists speak, glenoid cavity of the cheek, where it meets\r\nthe upper-lip, receives it, and the concave part admits a lubricous\r\nball projecting from the cheek, upon which it turns[1228].\r\nThis structure you will find in the stag-beetle, and some other\r\ntimber-devourers. Other _Coleoptera_ have only a process of a\r\nsimilar structure at each of the dorsal angles of the base of the\r\nmandible, the intermediate one being wanting; and the articulation\r\ndoes not materially differ, as far as I have examined them, in the\r\n_Hymenoptera_ and _Neuroptera_. In the _Orthoptera_, the structure\r\napproaches more nearly to that of the stag-beetle, since there are\r\n_three_ prominences: it is thus well described by M. Marcel de\r\nSerres: \"This articulation,\" says he, \"takes place in _two_ ways.\r\nAt first, in the upper surface of the mandible, and at its base,\r\nmay be observed two small prominences and a glenoid cavity; these\r\nprominences are received in two glenoid cavities excavated in the\r\nshell of the front, as the cavity of the mandible receives a small\r\nprominence of the same part. Below the mandible, and at its base,\r\nthere is a kind of condyle, which has its play in a cotyloid cavity\r\nexcavated in the shell of the temple, far below the eye, and at the\r\nextremity of the coriaceous integument of the head[1229].\" Within\r\nthe head in this order, at least in _Locusta_ Leach, is a vertical\r\n_septum_, which divides the head into two chambers, as it were,\r\nan occipital and a frontal, consisting of a concave triangular\r\nstem, terminating in two narrower concave triangular branches, so\r\nas to resemble the letter Y, and forming three openings, an upper\r\ntriangular one, and two lateral subquadrangular ones, which last are\r\nthe cavities that receive the base of the mandibles. This partition,\r\nwhich I would name _Cephalophragma_, doubtless affords a point of\r\nattachment to many of the muscles of the head. It does not appear to\r\nhave been noticed, unless it be synonymous with the _intermaxillary\r\narcade_ of Marcel de Serres[1230]. Probably a corresponding support\r\nto the muscles, &c. may exist, as we have seen it does in _Vespa_\r\nL.[1231], in many other heads of the different Orders, which have\r\nnot yet fallen under examination. Many mandibles, as those of the\r\nhornet &c., appear to be suspended to the cavity of the head on\r\nthe inside by a marginal ligament sufficiently relaxed to admit\r\nof their play: those of the _Orthoptera_, M. Marcel de Serres\r\ninforms us, are united to the head by means of two cartilages, the\r\noutermost being much the shortest, to which their moving muscles\r\nare attached. These he considers as prolongations of the substance\r\nof the mandible[1232]. The bottom of mandibles, when cleared of the\r\nmuscles &c., inclines almost universally to a triangular form; but\r\nin some cases, as in the stag-beetle, it is nearly a _trapezium_.\r\nI cannot conclude this subject without noticing the _motions_ of\r\nthe mandibles. What the author lately quoted has said with regard\r\nto those of the _Orthoptera_, will, I believe, apply equally well\r\nto all the mandibulate orders. \"The articulation of mandibles with\r\nthe skull appears to take place by two points solely; and as these\r\nparts only execute movements limited to a certain direction, they\r\nmay be referred to _ginglymus_[1233].--The movements of mandibles\r\nare limited to those from within outwards, and from without\r\ninwards[1234].\" Whether they are restricted from any degree of\r\nvertical motion, has not yet been proved, as the jaws of vertebrate\r\nanimals move horizontally as well as vertically--so those of insects\r\nmay have some motion vertically as well as horizontally; and it seems\r\nnecessary for some of their operations that they should. I am not\r\nanatomist enough to speak with confidence on the subject, but the\r\nball and socket articulation at the lower part of the mandible, and\r\nthe curving one at the upper, though a kind of _ginglymus_, seems to\r\nimply a degree of _rotatory_ movement, however slight.\r\n\r\nI must next say something upon the general shape of these organs.\r\nAlmost universally they incline to a triquetrous or three-sided\r\nfigure, with their external surface convex, sometimes partially\r\nso, and their internal concave. Most frequently they are arched,\r\ncurving inwards; but sometimes, as in _Prionus octangularis_[1235], a\r\nCapricorn beetle, and others of that genus, they are nearly straight;\r\nand in _Rhina barbirostris_[1236], a most remarkable Brazilian\r\nweevil, their curvature is outwards. In _Pholidotus lepidotus_\r\nMacLeay, and _Lucanus Elephas_, two insects of the stag-beetle tribe,\r\nthey are bent downwards; and in _Lucanus nebulosus_ K. (_Ryssonotus_\r\nMacLeay) they turn upwards[1237]. They are usually widest at the\r\nbase, and grow gradually more slender to the apex, but in the hornet\r\n(_Vespa Crabro_) the reverse takes place, and they increase in width\r\nfrom the base to the apex; and in the hive-bee, and others of that\r\ntribe, they are dilated both at base and apex, being narrowest in the\r\nmiddle; others are nearly of the same width every where. In those\r\ninsects that use their mandibles principally for purposes connected\r\nwith their economy, they are often more broad in proportion to\r\ntheir thickness, than they are in those which use them principally\r\nfor mastication. In the locust tribes (_Locusta_ Leach), they are\r\nextremely thick and powerful organs, and fitted for their work\r\nof devastation; but in the glow-worm (_Lampyris_), they are very\r\nslender and minute. In those brilliant beetles, the _Buprestes_,\r\nthey are very short; but in the stag-beetles, and those giants in\r\nthe Capricorn tribe, the _Prioni_, they are often very long[1238].\r\nThey either meet at the summit, lap over each other, cross each\r\nother, or are protended straight from the head; as you have doubtless\r\nobserved in the stag-beetle, whose terrific horns are mandibles\r\nof this description. These organs are usually _symmetrical_, but\r\nin some instances they are not: thus in _Hister lævus_, a kind of\r\ndung-beetle, the left hand mandible is longer than the right; in\r\n_Creophilus maxillosus_ K. (_Staphylinus_ L.), a common rove-beetle,\r\nin the left hand mandible the tooth in the middle is bifid, and in\r\nthe right hand one intire; and in _Bolbocerus_ K. the mandible of one\r\nside, in some species the dexter, and in others the sinister, has two\r\nteeth, and the other none.\r\n\r\nThe next circumstance with respect to these organs which demands our\r\nattention, is the _teeth_ with which they are armed. These are merely\r\nprocesses of the substance of the mandible, and not planted in it by\r\n_gomphosis_[1239], as anatomists speak, as they are in vertebrate\r\nanimals. They have, however, in their interior, at the base at least,\r\nin the _Orthoptera_, a coriaceous _lamina_ that separates them in\r\nsome sort from the body of the mandible[1240]. Many insects, however,\r\nhave mandibles without teeth; some merely tapering to a sharp point,\r\nothers obtuse at the end, and others truncated[1241]. Of those that\r\nhave teeth, some have them on the inside at the base, as _Manticora_,\r\nan African tiger-beetle[1242]; others in the middle, as _Staphylinus\r\nolens_, a rove-beetle, _Lethrus cephalotes_, &c.[1243]; others at the\r\nend, as many weevils (_Curculio_ L.)[1244]; others again on the back,\r\nas the _Rutelidæ_, a tribe of chafers[1245], and _Lethrus_, a beetle\r\njust named; others once more on the lower side of the base, in the form\r\nof a tooth or spine, as in _Melitta spinigera_, a species of wild-bee,\r\nand some of its affinities[1246]; and lastly, others on the upper side\r\nof the base in the form of a long tortuous horn, as in that singular\r\nwasp _Synagris cornuta_ F. before noticed as a sexual character[1247].\r\nIn the stag-beetle tribes (_Lucanus_ L.) these teeth are often\r\nelongated into short lateral branches, or a terminal fork[1248]. They\r\nare sometimes truncated, sometimes obtuse, and sometimes acute.\r\n\r\nBut with regard to their _kind_, it will be best to adopt the ideas\r\nof M. Marcel de Serres; for though his remarks are confined to\r\nthe _Orthoptera_, they may be applied with advantage to the teeth\r\nthat arm the mandibles of insects in general. He perceives an\r\nanalogy between those of this Order and the teeth of quadrupeds;\r\nand therefore divides them into _incisive_ or cutting, _laniary_\r\nor canine, and _molary_ or grinding teeth. He denominates those\r\n_incisives_ that are broad, having in some degree the shape of a\r\nwedge, their external surface being convex, and their internal\r\nconcave; whence they are evidently formed for cutting. The\r\n_laniaries_ are those which have a conical shape, are often very\r\nacute, and in general the longest of any; and in some insects, as\r\nthe carnivorous _Orthoptera_ (and the _Libellulina_), they cross\r\neach other. The _molaries_ are the largest of all, and their purpose\r\nis evidently to grind the food. There is never only a single one to\r\neach mandible, while the number of the incisives and laniaries is\r\nvery variable. As the molaries act the principal part in mastication,\r\nthey are nearer the inner base of the mandible or point of support:\r\nthey serve to grind the food, which has been first divided by the\r\nincisives or torn by the laniaries. The carnivorous tribes are\r\ndestitute of them; in the omnivorous ones they are very small, and\r\nin the herbivorous ones they are very large[1249]. So that in some\r\nmeasure you may conjecture the food of the animal from the teeth\r\nthat arm its mandibles. Of _incisive_ teeth you may find an example\r\nin those that arm the end of the mandibles of most grasshoppers\r\n(_Locusta_), and of the leaf-cutter-bees (_Megachile_ Latr.)[1250];\r\nof the _laniary_ or canine teeth, you will find good examples in\r\nthe mandibles of the dragon-flies (_Libellulina_); the two external\r\nteeth of the apex of those of the leaf-cutter bees may be regarded\r\nas between the incisives and laniaries; and the pointed mandibles\r\nwithout teeth may be deemed as terminating in a laniary one[1251].\r\nThe lower part of the inner or concave surface of the mandibles of\r\ngrasshoppers will supply you with instances of the _molary_ teeth,\r\nand the apex, also, of those of some weevils, as _Curculio Hancocki_\r\nK.[1252] But the most remarkable example of a molary organ is\r\nexhibited by many of the Lamellicorn beetles, especially those that\r\nfeed upon vegetables, whether flower or leaf.--Knoch, who indeed\r\nwas the first who proposed calling mandibles according to their\r\nteeth, incisive, laniary, or molary, but who does not explain his\r\nsystem clearly, observed that the mandibles of some _Melolonthæ_\r\nhave a projection with transverse, deep furrows, resembling a file,\r\nfor the purpose of bruising the leaves they feed upon[1253]: and\r\nM. Cuvier, long after, observed that the larvæ of the stag-beetle\r\nhave towards their base a flat, striated, molary surface; though he\r\ndoes not appear to have noticed it in any perfect insect[1254]. This\r\nstructure, with the exception of the _Scarabæidæ_ and _Cetoniadæ_,\r\nseems to extend very generally through the above tribe; since it may\r\nbe traced even in _Geotrupes_, the common dung-chafer, in which at\r\nthe base of one mandible is a concave molary surface, and in the\r\nother a convex one, but without any furrows: a circumstance that\r\noften distinguishes those that have furrows.--In the _Dynastidæ_ the\r\naffinity of structure with the _Melolonthidæ_ &c. is more pronounced,\r\nthe furrows to which ridges in the other mandible correspond being\r\nreduced to one or two wide and deep ones; whereas in some of the\r\nlatter tribe they are very numerous. These mandibles, in many cases,\r\nat their apex are furnished with incisive teeth to cut off their\r\nfood, and with miniature mill-stones to grind it[1255]. The part here\r\nalluded to I call the _Mola_.\r\n\r\nWere I to ask you what your idea is with regard to the use of\r\nthe organs we are considering, you would perhaps reply without\r\nhesitation, \"Of what possible use can the _jaws_ of insects be but\r\nto _masticate_ their food?\" But in this you would in many instances\r\nbe much mistaken; as you will own directly if you only look at\r\nthe mandibles of the stag-beetle--these protended and formidable\r\nweapons, as well as those of several other beetles, cannot be thus\r\nemployed. \"Of what other use, then, can they be?\" you will say.\r\nIn the particular instance here named, their use, independent of\r\nmastication, has not been satisfactorily ascertained; but in many\r\nother cases it has. Recollect, for instance, what I told you in a\r\nformer letter, of those larvæ that use their unguiform mandibles\r\nas instruments of _motion_[1256]. Again: amongst the Hymenopterous\r\ntribes, whose industry and varied economy have so often amused and\r\ninterested you, many have no other tools to aid them in their\r\nvarious labours and mechanical arts: to some they supply the place of\r\ntrowels, spades, and pick-axes; to others that of saws, scissors, and\r\nknives--with many other uses that might be named. In fact, with the\r\ninsects of this intire Order mastication seems merely a _secondary_,\r\nif it is at any time their use. Still comprehending in one view all\r\nthe mandibulate Orders, though some use their mandibles especially\r\nfor purposes connected with their economy, yet their most general\r\nand _primary_ use is the division, laceration, and mastication of\r\ntheir food; and this more exclusively than can be affirmed of the\r\nunder-jaws (_maxillæ_). This will appear evident to you, when you\r\nconsider that insects in their larva state, in which universally\r\ntheir primary business is _feeding_, with very few exceptions use the\r\norgans in question for the purpose of mastication, even in tribes, as\r\nthe _Lepidoptera_, that have only rudiments of them in their perfect\r\nstate--while the _maxillæ_ ordinarily are altogether unapt for such\r\nuse. The exceptions I have just alluded to are chiefly confined to\r\nthe instance of suctorious mandibles; or those which, being furnished\r\nat the end with an orifice, the animal inserting them into its prey,\r\nimbibes their juices through it. This is the case with the larvæ of\r\nsome _Dytisci_, _Hemerobius_, and _Myrmeleon_[1257]; and spiders have\r\na similar opening in the claw of their mandibles, which is supposed\r\nto instil venom into their prey[1258].\r\n\r\nUnder this head I must not pass without notice an appendage of the\r\nmandibles, to be found in some of the rove-beetles (_Staphylinidæ_),\r\nas in _Ocypus_, _Staphylinus_, and _Creophilus_ Kirby. In the first\r\nof these it is a curved, narrow, white, subdiaphanous, submembranous,\r\nor rather cartilaginous piece, proceeding from the upper side of the\r\nbase of the mandible[1259]; in the second it is broader, straighter,\r\nand fringed internally and at the end with hairs; and in this at\r\nfirst it wears the appearance of being attached laterally to the\r\nmandible under the tooth[1260], but if closely examined, you will\r\nfind that it is separate: in _Creophilus maxillosus_ it is broader.\r\nThis is the part I have named _prostheca_. It is perhaps useful in\r\npreventing the food from working out upwards during mastication.\r\n\r\n5. _Maxillæ_[1261]. The antagonist organs to the mandible in the\r\nlower side of the head, are the under-jaws, or _maxillæ_--so\r\ndenominated by the illustrious Entomologist of Kiel. Linné appears\r\nto have overlooked them, except in the case of his genus _Apis_, in\r\nwhich he regards them, and properly, as the sheath of the tongue.\r\nDe Geer looked upon them in general as part of the apparatus of the\r\nunder-lip or _labium_; and such in fact they are, as will appear when\r\nwe consider them more particularly. Fabricius has founded his system\r\nfor the most part upon these organs, the principal diagnostic of\r\nten out of his thirteen Classes (properly Orders) being taken from\r\nthem; and in the modern, which may be termed the _eclectic_, system,\r\nalthough the Orders are not founded upon them, yet the characters of\r\ngenera, and sometimes of large tribes, are derived from them: and as\r\nthey appear less liable to variation than almost any other organ, as\r\nMr. W. S. MacLeay has judiciously observed, there seems good reason\r\nfor employing them--it is therefore of importance that you should be\r\nwell acquainted with them.\r\n\r\nTheir _situation_ is usually below each mandible, on each side of the\r\n_labium;_ towards which they are often somewhat inclined, so that\r\ntheir tips meet when closed. In some cases, as in the Predaceous\r\nbeetles (_Carabus_ L. &c.), they exactly correspond with the\r\nmandibles; but in others their direction with respect to the head is\r\nmore longitudinal, as in the _Hymenoptera_, &c. In _substance_ they\r\nmay be generally stated to be less hard than those organs; yet in\r\nsome instances, as in the _Libellulina_, _Anoplognathidæ_, &c. they\r\nvie with them, and in the _Scarabæidæ_ and _Cetoniadæ_ exceed them,\r\nin hardness. In the bees, and many other _Hymenoptera_, they are\r\nsoft and leathery. Their _articulation_ is usually by means of the\r\nhinge on which they sit: it appears entirely ligamentous, and they\r\nare probably attached to the _labium_ at the base, or _mentum_--at\r\nleast this is evidently the case with the _Hymenoptera_, in which\r\nthe opening of the _maxillæ_ pushes forth the _labium_ and its\r\napparatus. In that remarkable genus related to the glow-worms, now\r\ncalled _Phengodes_ (_Lampyris plumosa_ F.), and in the case-worm\r\nflies (_Trichoptera_ K.), the _maxillæ_ appear to be connate with\r\nthe _labium_, or at least at their base.--As to their _composition_,\r\nthese organs consist of several pieces or portions. At their base\r\nthey articulate with a piece more or less triangular, which I call\r\nthe hinge (_Cardo_)[1262]. This on its inner side is often elongated\r\ntowards the interior of the base of the _labium_, to which it is, as\r\nI have just observed, probably attached. This elongate process of the\r\nhinge in _Apis_, _Bombus_, &c. appears a separate articulation; and\r\nthe two together form an angle upon which the _mentum_ sits[1263],\r\nand by this the _maxilla_ acts upon the labial apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe next piece is the _stipes_ or stalk of the _maxilla_. This is the\r\npart that articulates with the hinge, and may be regarded in some\r\ncases, as in the _Orthoptera_ &c., as the whole of the _maxilla_ below\r\nthe feeler; and in others, as in the _Geotrupidæ_, _Staphylinidæ_ &c.,\r\nas only the back of it, the inside forming the lower lobe. This piece\r\nis often harder and more corneous than the terminal part, is linear,\r\noften longitudinally angular, and in the bee-tribes (_Apis_ L.) is\r\nremarkable on its inner side for a series of bristles parallel to each\r\nother like the teeth of a comb[1264]. In _Pogonophorus_ Latr., a kind\r\nof dor or clock-beetle, it is armed on the back with four jointed\r\nspines, the intermediate one being forked[1265]. M. Latreille has thus\r\ndescribed the stipes of the _maxillæ_ of _Coleoptera_: \"Next comes\r\nthe stalk,\" says he, \"which consists of three parts: one occupies the\r\nback and bears the feeler; the second forms the middle of the anterior\r\nface, and its figure is triangular; the third fills the posterior\r\nspace comprised between the two preceding; and is that which is of\r\nmost consequence in the use of the _maxilla_; the anterior feeler,\r\nwhere there are two, the _galea_, and the other appendages that are of\r\nservice in deglutition, are part of that piece[1266].\"\r\n\r\nThe _third_ and terminal portion of the _maxilla_ is formed by the\r\nlobe, or lobes (_Lobi_). This may be called the most important part\r\nof the organ, since it is that which often acts upon the food, when\r\npreparing for deglutition. When armed with teeth or spines at the\r\nend, its substance is as hard as that of the mandibles; but when not\r\nso circumstanced, it is usually softer, resembling leather, or even\r\nmembrane[1267]; and sometimes the middle part is coriaceous, and the\r\nmargin membranous. This part is either simple, consisting only of\r\n_one_ lobe, as you will find to be the case with the _Hymenoptera_,\r\n_Dynastidæ_, _Nemognatha_, and several other beetles; or it is\r\ncompound, consisting of _two_ lobes. In the former case, the lobe is\r\nsometimes very long, as in the bee tribes, and the singular genus\r\nof beetles mentioned above[1268], _Nemognatha_; and at others very\r\nshort, as in _Hister_, &c. The bilobed _maxillæ_ present several\r\ndifferent types of form. Nearest to those with one lobe are those\r\nwhose lower lobe is attached longitudinally to the inner side of\r\nthe stalk of the organ, above which it scarcely rises. Of this\r\ndescription is the _maxilla_ in the common dung-beetle (_Geotrupes\r\nstercorarius_), and rove-beetle (_Staphylinus olens_).[1269]\r\nAnother kind of formation is where the lower lobe is only a little\r\nshorter than the upper: this occurs in a kind of chafer (_Macraspis\r\ntetradactyla_ MacLeay).[1270] A third is where the upper lobe covers\r\nthe lower as a shield; as you will find in the _Orthoptera_ order,\r\nand the _Libellulina_, and almost in _Meloe_[1271]. A fourth form is\r\nwhere the upper lobe somewhat resembles the galeate _maxilla_ just\r\nnamed; but consists of two joints. This exists in _Staphylinidæ_,\r\n&c.[1272] The last kind I shall notice is when the upper lobe not\r\nonly consists of two joints, but is cylindrical, and assumes the\r\naspect of a feeler or _palpus_[1273]. This is the common character\r\nof almost all the Predaceous beetles (_Entomophagi_ Latr.). This\r\nlobe, which has been regarded as an additional feeler, is strictly\r\nanalogous to the upper lobe in other insects, and therefore should\r\nrather be denominated a palpiform lobe than a _palpus_. Where there\r\nare two lobes, the upper one is most commonly the longest; but in\r\nmany species of the tribe last mentioned the lower one equals or\r\nexceeds it in length[1274].\r\n\r\nThe lobes vary in form, clothing, and appendages. The upper palpiform\r\nlobe in those beetles just mentioned, in general varies scarcely\r\nat all in _form_; but the genus _Cychrus_ (which is remarkable\r\nfor a retrocession from the general type of form of the _Carabi_\r\nL. making an approach towards that of those _Heteromera_ which,\r\nfrom their black body and revolting aspect, Latreille has named\r\n_Melosomes_,) affords an exception, the upper joint being rather\r\nflat, linear-lanceolate, incurved, and covering the lower lobe[1275],\r\nwhich it somewhat resembles. The lower lobe also in this tribe\r\nvaries as little as the upper, being shaped like the last joint of\r\nthat lobe in _Cychrus_ just described, except that in _Cicindela_ it\r\nis narrowest in the middle[1276]. In other tribes the upper valve is\r\nsometimes linear and rounded at the apex, and the lower truncated, as\r\nin _Staphylinus olens_[1277]; sometimes the upper one is truncated or\r\nobtuse, and the lower acute, as in _Trogosita_ and _Parnus_[1278]. In\r\n_Ptinus_, another tribe of beetles, before noticed as injurious to\r\nour museums[1279], the reverse of this takes place, the upper-lobe,\r\nwhich is the smallest and shortest, being acute, and the lower\r\ntruncated[1280]. In _Blaps_ both are acute[1281]. In _Rhipiphorus_\r\nand _Scolytus_ the lobes are nearly obsolete. The lower lobe is bifid\r\nin _Languria_, a North American genus of beetles, so as to give the\r\nmaxilla the appearance of three lobes[1282]; and in _Erotylus_,\r\na South American one, the upper is triangular[1283]: it is often\r\noblong, quadrangular, linear, &c. in others.--In those that have\r\nonly one lobe the shape also varies. In _Gyrinus_, the beetle that\r\nwhirls round and round on the surface of every pool, which, though\r\nit belongs to the Predaceous tribe, has only one lobe, the lobe\r\nrepresents a mandible in shape of the laniary kind, being trigonal\r\nand acute[1284]; and in the _Anoplognathidæ_, a New Holland tribe\r\nof chafers, in which it is, as it were, broken, the lobe forming an\r\nangle with the stalk, it is concavo-convex and obtuse, and somewhat\r\nfigures a molary tooth[1285]. In the first tribe into which the bees\r\n(_Apis_ L.) have been divided (_Melitta_ Kirby), the lobe is often\r\nlinear or strap-shaped, and bifid at the apex; and in the second\r\n(_Apis_ K.) lanceolate and intire[1286]. In _Cerocoma_ it is long and\r\nnarrow[1287]. More variations in form might be named, but these are\r\nsufficient to give you a general idea of them in this respect. With\r\nregard to their _clothing_, I have not much to observe--in examining\r\nthe Predaceous beetles you will observe, that the interior margin of\r\nthe lower incurved lobe is fringed with stiff bristles or slender\r\nspines, and in many other beetles either one or both lobes have a\r\nthick coating or brush of stiffish hairs[1288]; but in several cases\r\nonly the apex of the lobe is hairy. In the _Orthoptera_ order, and\r\nmany of the _Melolonthidæ_ or chafers, the whole _maxilla_ is without\r\nhairs, or nearly so.\r\n\r\nThe _appendages_ of the _maxillæ_ are next to be noticed. These are\r\nprincipally their claws, or laniary teeth; for they are seldom armed\r\nwith incisive or molary teeth. The whole tribe of Predaceous beetles,\r\nwith few exceptions, have the inner lobe of their _maxilla_ armed\r\nwith a terminal claw, which in the _Cicindelidæ_ articulates with the\r\nlobe, and is moveable, but in the rest of the tribe is fixed[1289].\r\nIn _Phoberus_ MacLeay the lower lobe has two spines[1290]. In\r\n_Locusta_ this lobe has three or four spines or laniary teeth, and\r\nin _Æshna_ there are six, which, like the claw of _Cicindela_, are\r\nmoveable[1291]. In others both lobes terminate in a single spine or\r\nclaw: this is the case with _Paxillus_ MacLeay[1292]. In _Passalus_,\r\nnearly related to the last genus, the upper lobe is armed with a\r\nsingle spine, and the lower one with two[1293]. Those _maxillæ_\r\nthat terminate in a single lobe are also often distinguished by the\r\nspines or teeth with which it is armed; thus in a nondescript chafer\r\nbelonging to the _Dynastidæ_ (_Archon_ K. MS.) it terminates in _two_\r\nshort teeth; in that remarkable Petalocerous genus _Hexodon_ Oliv.\r\nin _three_ truncated _incisive_ ones[1294]; in _Dynastes Hercules_\r\nin three _acute_ spines[1295]. _Four_ similar ones arm the apex of\r\nthe _maxilla_ in that tribe of _Rutelidæ_ which have striated elytra;\r\nand _five_ that are stout and triquetrous those of _Melolontha\r\nStigma_ F. Many others have _six_ spines, sometimes arranged in a\r\ntriple series[1296]. Besides teeth or spines, in some cases the\r\nlobes of _maxillæ_ terminate in several long and slender _laciniæ_\r\nor lappets fringed with hairs. At least those of a _Leptura_\r\n(_L. quadrifasciata_ L.) described by De Geer, appear to be thus\r\ncircumstanced. He conjectures that this beetle uses its _maxillæ_ to\r\ncollect the honey from the flowers[1297].\r\n\r\nAs the principal use of the mandibles is cutting and masticating, so\r\nthat of the organs we are considering seems to be primarily that of\r\n_holding_ the food and preventing it from falling while the former\r\nare employed upon it. I say this is their _primary_ use; for I\r\nwould by no means deny that they assist occasionally in comminuting\r\nor lacerating it. In fact, were there no organs appropriated to\r\nthis use, and if both mandibles and _maxillæ_ were employed at\r\nthe same time in comminuting the food, it seems to me that it\r\nmust fall from the mouth. In a large proportion of insects the\r\nlobes of the _maxillæ_ are not at all calculated for laceration or\r\ncomminution; and in those tribes--as the _Melolonthidæ_, _Rutelidæ_,\r\n_Dynastidæ_--in which they seem most fitted for that purpose, the\r\nmandibles have _incisive_ teeth at their apex, and at their base a\r\npowerful _mola_ or grinder: circumstances which prove, that even in\r\nthis case the business of mastication principally devolves upon them.\r\n\r\n6. _Palpi Maxillares_[1298]. There is one circumstance that\r\nparticularly distinguishes the _maxillæ_ from the mandibles--they\r\nare _palpigerous_, as well as the under-lip. The feelers, or palpi,\r\nemerge usually from a sinus observable on the back of the _maxillæ_\r\nwhere the upper lobe and stalk meet. Their articulation does not\r\nmaterially differ from that of the labial palpi. Each _maxilla_ has\r\nproperly only _one_ feeler; but, as was lately observed[1299], in\r\ncertain tribes the upper lobe is jointed and palpiform, which has\r\noccasioned it to be considered as a feeler, and these tribes have\r\nbeen regarded as having six feelers. The most general rule with\r\nregard to the _length_ of the _palpi_ is, that the maxillary shall\r\nbe longer than the labial; but the reverse often takes place. In\r\nmany _bees_ the maxillary consist only of a _single_ joint, and\r\nare very _short_; while the labial consist of _four_, and are very\r\n_long_[1300]: and in some insects (as in _Pogonophorus_ Latr.)\r\nthe four palpi are of equal length[1301]. The antennæ are most\r\ncommonly longer than the palpi; but in several aquatic beetles, as\r\n_Elophorus_, _Hydrophilus_, &c., whose antennæ in the water are not\r\nin use, the organs we are considering are the longest.--As to the\r\n_number_ of their articulations, it varies from one to six; which\r\nnumber they are not known to exceed. In each of the Orders a kind\r\nof law seems to have been observed as to the number of joints both\r\nin the maxillary and labial palpi, but which admits of several\r\nexceptions. Thus in the _Coleoptera_, the _natural_ number may\r\nbe set at _four_ joints for the _maxillary_, and _three_ for the\r\n_labial_ palpi: yet sometimes, as in _Stenus_, _Notoxus_, &c., the\r\n_former_ have only _three_ joints, and the _latter_, as in _Stenus_\r\nand _Tillus_, only _two_. In the _Orthoptera_ the law enjoins _five_\r\nfor the _maxillary_, and _three_ for the _labial_; and to this I\r\nhave hitherto observed no exception. In the _Hymenoptera_, the rule\r\nis _six_ and _four_, but with considerable exceptions, especially\r\nas to the _maxillary_ palpi, which vary from _six_ joints to a\r\n_single_ one: thus in the hive-bee and the humble-bee, the labials,\r\nincluding the two flat joints or elevators, have four joints, while\r\nthe maxillaries are not jointed at all[1302]. In _Chrysis_, in which\r\nthe latter consist of _five_, the former are reduced to _three_. The\r\n_Libellulina_ may almost be regarded as having no maxillary palpi,\r\nsince they exhibit no organ that is distinctly palpiform. It seems to\r\nme that the upper lobe of their maxilla, which articulates with the\r\nstalk in the same manner as a feeler, may be regarded as an instance\r\nin which that lobe and the feeler coalesce into one; and the mucro\r\nthat proceeds from the lobe has the aspect of an emerging feeler, and\r\ncorresponds somewhat with the labial one above noticed[1303]. In the\r\nremainder of the _Neuroptera_ and the _Trichoptera_, the prevailing\r\nnumber is _five_ and _three_. In the latter there are exceptions,\r\nwhich will furnish good characters for genera. In the _Lepidoptera_\r\nwe find _two_, and sometimes _three_, the maxillary being very\r\nminute[1304]. The _Diptera_ Order presents two tribes in this\r\nrespect quite distinct from each other. The most natural number of\r\njoints in the maxillary palpi of the _Tipulidæ_, _Culicidæ_, &c. is\r\n_four_ or _five_: the last joint, however, in _Tipula_, _Ctenocera_,\r\n&c. like that of the antennæ in _Tabanus_ L., appears to consist\r\nof a number of very minute joints[1305]; but in the _Asilidæ_ and\r\n_Muscidæ_, &c., the number _two_ seems to be most prevalent[1306].\r\nThe _labial_ palpi in this order are obsolete.--As to _shape_, the\r\nmaxillary palpi, as well as the labial, are usually filiform; but in\r\nthe weevil tribes (_Curculio_ L.) they are most commonly very short\r\nand conical[1307]; in the chafers (_Scarabæus_ L.) they usually are\r\nthickest at the apex[1308]; in _Megachile_ and _Euglossa_, wild bees,\r\nthey are setaceous, growing gradually more slender from the base\r\nto the summit[1309]: a tribe of small water-beetles (_Haliplus_),\r\nthe saw-flies (_Tenthredo_ L.), and several other _Hymenoptera_,\r\nhave them thickest in the middle[1310]. Their most important part,\r\nhowever, and that which varies most in form, is the _terminal_\r\njoint:--of this I have already related some singular instances[1311],\r\nand shall now describe a few more. This joint is sometimes acute,\r\nat others blunt, at others truncated: in figure it is ovate,\r\noblong, obtriangular, hatchet-shaped, lunate, transverse, conical,\r\nmammillate, subulate, branched, chelate, laciniate, lamellate, &c.\r\n&c.[1312]: terms which I shall more fully explain to you hereafter,\r\nand which I only mention here to show the numerous variations as to\r\nfigure, of which this joint exhibits examples. The palpi in general\r\nat their vertex are often rather concave; and this concavity is\r\nformed by a thin papillose membrane, which it is supposed the animal\r\nhas the power of pushing out a little, so as to apply it to surfaces.\r\nThe _primary_ use of the palpi of insects will be considered when I\r\ntreat of their senses; but they probably answer more purposes than\r\none. For instance, when I was once examining, under a lens, the\r\nproceedings of a species of _Mordella_, which was busily employed\r\nin the blossom of some umbelliferous plant, it appeared to me to\r\nopen the anthers with its maxillary palpi, and they often held the\r\nanther between them: when not so employed, they were kept in intense\r\nvibration, more than even its antennæ; and at the same time, as far\r\nas I could judge, an _Elater_ made the same use of them.\r\n\r\n7. _Lingua_[1313].--This name was applied by Linné to the part in\r\ninsects representing the _tongue_ in vertebrate animals; and as it\r\nperforms most of the common offices of a tongue, and the _pharynx_\r\nis situated with respect to it, as we shall presently see, nearly\r\nas it is in those animals, there seems no more reason for giving\r\nit a new name, than there is for giving a new name to the head or\r\nlegs of insects, because in some respects they differ from those of\r\nthe higher animals. I shall not therefore call it _Ligula_, with\r\nFabricius and Latreille, nor _Labium_, with Cuvier and others, but\r\nadhere to the original term, which every one understands.\r\n\r\nThe _tongue_ lies between the two _lips_--the _labrum_ and _labium_.\r\nOn its upper side, at the base, it meets the palate or roof of the\r\nmouth, below which it is attached, it may be presumed, by its roots\r\nto the crust of the head, on each side the _pharynx_ or swallow; and\r\non its lower side, in many cases, it is attached to the _labium_, and\r\nthat very closely, so as to appear to be merely a part of it, and\r\nto form its extremity: but in the _Orthoptera_ and _Libellulina_,\r\nit is more free, and in form somewhat resembling the tongue of the\r\nquadrupeds[1314].--In _substance_ the tongue varies. In general it\r\nseems something between membrane and cartilage; but in the Predaceous\r\nbeetles, in which it is not covered by the _labium_, it approaches\r\nnearer to the substance of the general integument, and in _Anthia_ F.\r\nit is quite hard and horny:--that just mentioned of the _Orthoptera_\r\nand _Libellulina_ is more fleshy[1315]. With regard to its _station_,\r\nin many cases, as in the instance just named, in the Lamellicorn\r\ntribe (_Scarabæus_ L.) and others, it is, when unemployed, concealed\r\nwithin the mouth; the lips, mandibles, and maxillæ all closing over\r\nit. The tongue of some _Hymenoptera_ also is retractile within the\r\nmouth. \"When _ants_ are disposed to drink,\" says M. P. Huber, \"there\r\ncomes out from between their lower jaws, which are much shorter\r\nthan the upper, a minute, conical, fleshy, yellowish process, which\r\nperforms the office of a tongue, being pushed out and drawn in\r\nalternately: it appears to proceed from the lower-lip.--This lip has\r\nthe power of moving itself forwards in conjunction with the lower\r\njaws: and when the insect wishes to lap, all this apparatus moves\r\nforward; so that the tongue, which is very short, does not require to\r\nlengthen itself much to reach the liquid[1316].\" M. Lamarck thinks\r\nthat the _labium_ of insects has a _vertical_ motion (_de haut en bas\r\nou de bas en haut_)[1317]. This it certainly has in some degree; but\r\nit has also, as in the above case, a more powerful _horizontal_ one,\r\nwhich is produced, in _Hymenoptera_ at least, by the opening of the\r\nmaxillæ--as I have already observed[1318].\r\n\r\nI have little to say with respect to the _structure_ of the tongue:\r\nit generally seems to be without articulations; but in many bees it\r\narticulates with the _labium_ where it enters it, so as when unemployed\r\nto form a fold with it. In the hive-bee it terminates in a kind of\r\nknob or button, which has been falsely supposed to be perforated\r\nfor imbibing the honey by suction. The upper part of this tongue\r\nis cartilaginous, and remarkable for a number of transverse rings:\r\nbelow the middle, it consists of a membrane, longitudinally folded in\r\ninaction, but capable of being inflated to a considerable size: this\r\nmembranous bag receives the honey which the tongue, as it were, laps\r\nfrom the flowers, and conveys it to the _pharynx_[1319]. In _Stenus_\r\nthis organ is retractile, and consists of two joints[1320].\r\n\r\nThe _shape_ of the tongue of insects probably varies as much as\r\nany other part; but as it is apt to shrink when dried[1321],\r\nand is not easy to come at, we know but little of its various\r\nconfigurations:--in the bees it is very long, in most other insects\r\nvery short. Though frequently simple and undivided, in many cases\r\nit presents a different conformation. Thus in the saw-flies\r\n(_Tenthredo_ L.) it terminates in three equal lobes[1322]; in\r\n_Stomis_ and _Geotrupes_ in three unequal ones, the intermediate\r\nbeing very short[1323]; in _Carabus_, in three short teeth[1324];\r\nin _Pogonophorus_ it represents a trident[1325]; in the wasp it is\r\nbifid, each lobe being tipped with a callosity[1326]; in _Melolontha\r\nStigma_ it is bipartite[1327]; in _Elaphrus_, the analogue of the\r\ntiger-beetles, it terminates in a single tooth or point; in the\r\naquatic beetles, _Dytiscus_ L., it is quadrangular and without\r\nteeth[1328]; in some _Ichneumonidæ_ it is concavo-convex, and forms a\r\ndemitube; and in others it is nearly cylindrical[1329].\r\n\r\nIn many insects it has no _hairs_, but in the Predaceous beetles it\r\ngenerally terminates in a couple of bristles[1330]. In the hive-\r\nhumble- and other bees, it is extremely hairy[1331]; a circumstance\r\nwhich probably enables it more effectually to despoil the flowers of\r\ntheir nectar. In _Geotrupes stercorarius_, the common dungchafer, and\r\n_Melolontha Stigma_ lately mentioned, the lobes of the tongue are\r\nfringed with incurved hairs[1332]; and in _Æshna_ it is hairy on the\r\nupper side, each hair or bristle crowning a minute tubercle. In many\r\ncases the tongue is attended, and sometimes sheathed at the base,\r\nby two usually membranous appendages:--these the learned Illiger\r\nhas denominated _paraglossæ_; and I shall adopt his term. You\r\nwill find them frequently attached to the tongue of the Predaceous\r\nbeetles[1333], and to that of many _Hymenoptera_. In the hive-bee and\r\nhumble-bee they are short, and take their origin within the _labial_\r\nfeelers[1334]: in _Euglossa_, another bee, they are long, involute at\r\nthe tips, and, what is not usual with them, very hairy[1335]: in the\r\nwasp, like the lobes of the tongue, they are tipped with a callosity.\r\n\r\nUnder this head I may observe to you, that the insects whose oral\r\norgans we are considering besides a _tongue_ appear likewise to be\r\nfurnished with a _palate_ (_Palatum_). This, though a part of the\r\nroof of the mouth, is not precisely in the situation of the palate\r\nof vertebrate animals, since it seems rather the internal lining of\r\nthe _labrum_. If you take the common dragon-fly (_Æshna viatica_),\r\nyou will find that the under side of this part and of the _rhinarium_\r\nis lined with a quadrangular fleshy cushion, beset, like the upper\r\nsurface of the tongue, with minute black tubercles, crowned with\r\na bristle. This cushion is divided transversely into two parts by\r\na depression; the anterior or outer piece being attached to the\r\n_labrum_, and the other piece to the _rhinarium_. The former has a\r\ncentral longitudinal cavity, black at the bottom, on the sides of\r\nwhich the tubercles are flat and without a bristle. From its base on\r\neach side a spiniform process emerges, forming a right angle with it.\r\nThese processes seem the antagonists of those mentioned above[1336],\r\nthat emerge from the _labium_. The posterior or inner piece has on\r\neach side a roundish space, attached to the under surface of the two\r\nsides of the _rhinarium_, beset also with bristle-bearing tubercles.\r\nYou will find something similar lining the _labrum_ and _nasus_ of\r\nsome _Coleoptera_,--say _Geotrupes_, _Necrophorus_, and _Dytiscus_.\r\nThe first piece I regard as the analogue of the palate, and the\r\nsecond as connected with the sense of _smelling_. In _Necrophorus_\r\nthe circular pieces are covered with a finely striated membrane, and\r\nin _Dytiscus_ each has a little nipple.\r\n\r\n8. _Pharynx_[1337].--On the upper side of the tongue, usually at its\r\nbase or root, is the _pharynx_, or aperture by which the food passes\r\nfrom the mouth to the _œsophagus_. This orifice, which is situated\r\nwith respect to the tongue of the _Orthoptera_ and _Libellulina_\r\nnearly as in those insects (at least as far as I have been able to\r\nexamine them), whose tongue is called a _ligula_ or _labium_,--of\r\ncourse exists in all the mandibulate Orders whose mouth we are now\r\nconsidering. In the _Hymenoptera_ it is covered by a valve, the\r\n_Epipharynx_ of Savigny; and it appeared to me to be so likewise in\r\none of the _Harpalidæ_ that I examined. The formation seems different\r\nin _Geotrupes_, as far as I can get an idea of it; but it is so\r\ndifficult to examine the interior of the mouth without laceration of\r\nsome of the parts, that I can only tell you what the appearances were\r\nin one instance, upon removing the _labrum_ from the _mandibles_; and\r\nin another, separating the whole apparatus of the _labium_, including\r\nthe _maxillæ_, from the _mandibles_ and _labrum_. In the former case,\r\nthe mandibles coincided at the base, the two molary plates (_molæ_),\r\nwhich in this genus are narrow, transverse and not furrowed, are\r\nso applied as evidently to have an action upon each other, as the\r\nmandible opens and shuts, proper for trituration. Within these is\r\nthe base of the tongue, under the form of a ventricose sack. The\r\nupper part of this last organ, which forms the internal covering\r\nof the labium, appears to consist of three (in the recent insect\r\n_fleshy_) lobes, the middle one being bent downwards internally, so\r\nas to form a kind of sloping cover to an orifice in the part I call\r\nthe base. After two or three days, the tongue shrinks and dries to\r\na hard substance;--between the mandibles and the base of the tongue\r\nI could not discover the _pharynx_. The above apparent opening\r\ncovered by the tongue was the only one I could perceive. In the\r\nlatter case, the form and structure of the base of the tongue is more\r\nvisible: it is an oblong ventricose tubular sack, projecting above\r\nanteriorly into an acute angle formed by a fine white membrane, most\r\nbeautifully and delicately striated with oblique striæ, to be seen\r\nonly under a powerful lens: on the anterior side of this sack are\r\ntwo parallel cartilaginous ridges close to each other, fringed with\r\nshort hairs, which take their origin from the angle. I could not be\r\ncertain whether the orifice covered by the intermediate lobe was only\r\napparent, or real; but I did not succeed in my endeavour to find any\r\nother _pharynx_, though from the molary structure of the base of the\r\nmandibles one may conjecture that there must be one situated at the\r\nbase of this sack to receive the food they render after trituration.\r\nThe excrement of this animal is not fluid. In the _Libellulina_\r\nthe _pharynx_ seems closed by two valves meeting. This part in\r\n_Hymenoptera_, and probably in other Orders, has the aspect of being\r\ncartilaginous and fitted to sustain the action of the substances that\r\nhave to pass through it[1338].\r\n\r\nThe _Epipharynx_ is a valve, called by M. Latreille _sublabrum_\r\n(_sous labre_[1339]), attached by its base to the upper margin of\r\nthe _pharynx_, or that next the _labrum_. In the bees it is said by\r\nReaumur to be of a fleshy substance, and capable of changing its\r\nfigure. He seems to think it the real _tongue_ of the bee[1340]; but\r\nas it does not appear to have any of the uses of a tongue, and merely\r\ncloses the orifice of the mouth, it surely does not merit that name.\r\nM. Savigny calls it a membranous appendage which exactly closes the\r\n_pharynx_[1341]. De Geer has examined the _epipharynx_ of the wasp,\r\nwhich he describes as of a scaly substance, and regards merely as the\r\ncover of the part just named[1342].\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _Hypopharynx_, which Latreille considers as a\r\nsupport and appendage of the _epipharynx_, I have little to add to\r\nthe definition I have given of it above. In the _Libellulina_ the\r\nbase of the tongue terminates towards the _pharynx_ in a fleshy\r\ncushion, armed at each angle next to that part with a short hard\r\nhorn or tooth of a black colour. This cushion, I suppose, may be\r\nanalogous to the _hypopharynx_ of M. Savigny[1343]. On the opposite\r\nside the pharynx is closed by another fleshy cushion (_epipharynx?_),\r\nwhich appears to line the nose, behind those two mammillæ before\r\ndescribed[1344], which form the internal covering of the _rhinarium_.\r\n\r\nBefore I call your attention to what I would denominate an\r\n_imperfect mouth_, in which some one or more of the seven organs\r\nabove enumerated exist under another form, or only as rudiments,--I\r\nmust say something upon the mouth of the _Myriapods_ and _Arachnida_,\r\nin which there seem to be _redundant_ organs of manducation.--M.\r\nLatreille, in the Essay lately quoted, in which, though some of\r\nhis notions seem fanciful, he has shown a vast depth and range of\r\nthought and research, has asserted,--from the admirable and curious\r\nobservations of M. Savigny, and those which since their publication\r\nhe has made himself,--that the masticating organs of _annulose_\r\nanimals (called by him _condylopes_) are a kind of _legs_[1345].\r\nAnd M. Savigny, whose indefatigable labours and unparalleled\r\nacuteness have opened the door to a new and vast field in what may\r\nbe denominated analogical anatomy,--has observed, that with certain\r\n_Apiropods_[1346] the organs that serve for manducation do not differ\r\nessentially from those which, with the other _Apiropods_ and the\r\n_Hexapods_, serve for _locomotion_[1347]: and the unguiform mandibles\r\nof the larvæ of certain _Diptera_, you have before been told, are\r\nused not only in manducation, but also as legs[1348]. These remarks\r\nwill satisfactorily prove to you, that organs which at first sight\r\npossess no visible affinity or analogy--as for instance, jaws and\r\nlegs--may, if traced through a long series of beings, exhibit a very\r\ngreat one;--and will lessen your surprise when you find, that in\r\ncertain tribes such commutations of organs and their use take place.\r\n\r\nThe following is the structure, as to its organs, of the mouth of\r\nthe myriapods, as exhibited by the centipedes (_Scolopendridæ_). The\r\npart which appears to perform the office of the upper lip (but which\r\nM. Savigny regards as the nose, calling it the _chaperon_,) is a\r\ntransverse piece with a deep anterior sinus, in the centre of which is\r\na minute tooth[1349]. This piece is separated from the forepart of the\r\nhead by a suture; but it probably is not moveable: however, it covers\r\nthe mouth, and may be regarded rather as analogous to the _labrum_.\r\nBelow this are two mandibles, armed at their end with five sharp\r\ntriangular teeth[1350], under which are the _maxillæ_, terminating\r\nin a moveable concavo-convex lobe, resembling the valve of a bivalve\r\nshell[1351]; and between them is the _labium_, of a rhomboidal shape,\r\ndivisible into two lobes, attached laterally to the maxillæ: these\r\nlobes M. Savigny terms the _second maxillæ_, forming with the others,\r\naccording to him, the _labium_[1352]. Affixed to the base of this\r\nlabium, or covering it on the outside, are a pair of pediform palpi,\r\nwhich he considers as the first auxiliary _labium_, and representative\r\nof the first pair of legs of hexapods and _Iuli_[1353]. I imagine them\r\nto be also the analogues, in some degree, of the labial palpi of a\r\nperfect mouth. The last of the organs in question is a large rhomboidal\r\nplate affixed to the first apparent segment of the trunk, crowned at\r\nits vertex with two truncated denticulated teeth, and from the upper\r\nsides of which emerge a pair of moveable organs terminating in a\r\npowerful incurved claw, and which entirely covers all the other parts\r\nof the mouth[1354]. This, M. Savigny deems as a _second_ auxiliary\r\n_labium_, and the lateral organs of prehension,--which may be regarded\r\neach as a kind of maxillary hand, and as the only representatives in\r\nthis tribe of the maxillary palpi, though widely different,--he looks\r\nupon as really analogous to the _second_ pair of legs in _Iulus_\r\nand the hexapods[1355]. These two pairs of pedipalpes (to use an\r\nexpressive French term) show their relation to legs by their general\r\nstructure, and their analogy with palpi by their use as _oral_ organs,\r\nthough belonging to the _trunk_: so that here we see the _legs_ and\r\ntheir appendages assume a material function in _manducation_, forming\r\na singular contrast to what we had observed before with regard to\r\n_mandibles_ becoming instruments of _locomotion_. The mouth of the\r\n_Iulidæ_, with little variation, is upon the same plan[1356] with those\r\nhere described.\r\n\r\nThe next type of form with regard to the oral organs is that of the\r\n_Arachnida_. In these, as you know, the head is confounded with the\r\ntrunk; so that they are a kind of Blemmyes in the insect world. Their\r\norgans of manducation, amongst which there is no _labrum_ or upper lip,\r\nare, in the first place, a pair of mandibles planted close and parallel\r\nto each other in the anterior part of the head, which they terminate.\r\nIn the spiders they consist of two tubular joints, of which the first\r\nis much the largest, more or less conical or cylindrical, and armed\r\nunderneath with a double row of stout teeth; and the terminal one is\r\nmore solid and harder, in the form of a very sharp crooked claw, which\r\nin inaction is folded on the first joint between the teeth. Under its\r\nextremity on the outside is a minute orifice, destined to transmit a\r\nvenomous fluid, which is conducted there by an internal canal from\r\nthe base of the first joint, where is the poison-bag[1357]. In the\r\nscorpion and harvest-man (_Phalangium_) the mandible consists of two\r\njoints terminated by a _chela_ or double claw, the exterior one being\r\nmoveable[1358].--M. Latreille, as has been before observed, regards\r\nthese not as representatives of the mandibles of hexapods, but as\r\nreplacing the interior pair of antennæ, in the situation of which they\r\nare precisely placed, of the _Crustacea_[1359]: and M. Savigny is of\r\nopinion that the _Arachnida_ may in some sort be defined as _Crustacea_\r\nwithout a head, and with twelve legs, of which the two first pair are\r\nconverted into _mandibles_ and _maxillæ_[1360]. From the _situation_ of\r\nthe organs in question, the first of these opinions seems preferable;\r\nbut the conversion of the legs in other cases, at least the _coxæ_,\r\ninto organs of manducation, gives some weight to the last. With regard\r\nto their _use_, it is said to be to retain the insect which the animal\r\nhas seized, and to facilitate the compression which the maxillæ\r\nexercise upon it for the extraction of the nutritive matter[1361].\r\nIf this be correct, _in this respect_ the mandibles may be said to\r\nrepresent the _maxillæ_ of the mandibulate hexapods; and, _vice versa_,\r\nthe _sciatic_ maxillæ, as they have been denominated[1362], of the\r\n_Arachnida_, their mandibles. The palpi are pediform, and the first\r\njoint of the _coxa_, or hip, acts the part of a _maxilla_:--this is\r\ncomposed of a single piece or plate, more or less oval or triangular,\r\nsometimes straight and sometimes inclined to the _labium_, with\r\nthe interior extremity very hairy. The _labium_ consists also of a\r\nsingle piece, and is only an appendage of the anterior extremity of\r\nthe breast. The interior of the mouth, or palate, presents a fleshy,\r\nhairy, linguiform piece, which is usually applied to the internal face\r\nof the _labium_. An opening is supposed to exist in its sides, for\r\nthe transmission of the alimentary juices[1363]. If you examine the\r\nunder side of the body of a scorpion, you will find that not only the\r\npalpi, but the two anterior pair of legs, by means of their _coxæ_, are\r\nconcerned in manducation: so that these insects have in fact _three_\r\npairs of maxillæ--a circumstance that M. Savigny has observed to take\r\nplace also in the harvest-men (_Phalangium_ L.)[1364]. The _palpi_ of\r\nthe scorpion, which may be called its _hands_, like the anterior legs\r\nof the lobster and crab, terminate in a tremendous _chela_ or forceps,\r\nconsisting of a large triangular joint, armed at the end with a double\r\nclaw internally toothed; the _exterior_ one of which, contrary to\r\nwhat takes place in the animals just named, is moveable, and not the\r\n_interior_[1365].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving given you this full account of the _trophi_ of those animals\r\nthat have all the organs of manducation developed, I must next advert\r\nto those in which one part receives an increment at the expense of\r\nothers, and the whole oral machine is fitted for _suction_; or where\r\nsome parts appear to be deficient, so that this may be called an\r\n_imperfect_ mouth. At first sight one would regard the trophi of a\r\n_bee_ as of this description; but this is not the case, since it has\r\nall the ordinary organs, though the tongue is unusually long, and\r\nlooks as if it was made for suction; which, however, as you have been\r\ninformed, is not the case.\r\n\r\nThere are _five_ kinds of _imperfect_ mouth to be met with in insects\r\nthat take their food by suction, each of which I shall distinguish\r\nby a separate denomination. The first is that of the _Hemiptera_\r\nOrder:--this I term the _Promuscis_; the second is that of the\r\n_Diptera_, which with Linné I call _Proboscis_; the third, peculiar\r\nto the _Lepidoptera_, is with me an _Antlia_; the fourth, which I\r\nname _Rostrulum_, is confined to the _Aphaniptera_ order, or genus\r\n_Pulex_ L.; and the last is _Rostellum_, which I employ to denote the\r\nsuctory organs of the louse tribe (_Pediculidæ_).\r\n\r\n\r\ni. _Promuscis_[1366].--The organ we are first to consider has usually\r\nbeen denominated _Rostrum_: but since that term is likewise in\r\ngeneral use for the snout of insects of the weevil tribes (_Curculio_\r\nL.), I think you will concur with me in adopting the one here\r\nproposed, for the very different oral instruments of the _Hemiptera_.\r\nIlliger has employed _promuscis_ to denote those of _bees_[1367]:\r\nbut since, as I have just observed, they consist of all the ordinary\r\norgans, they seem to require no separate denomination: the term,\r\ntherefore, may be applied to represent a different set of _trophi_,\r\nwithout any risk of producing confusion. This part consists of\r\n_five_ pieces: viz. a minute, long, conical piece, commonly very\r\nslender, which covers the base of the _promuscis_, and represents the\r\n_labrum_[1368]; a jointed sheath (_vagina_), consisting of either\r\nthree or four joints, the analogue of the _labium_, and four slender\r\nrigid lancets (_scalpella_), the two exterior ones, according to M.\r\nSavigny, representing the _mandibles_, and the intermediate pair\r\nthe _maxillæ_[1369]. By the union of these four pieces a suctorious\r\ntube is formed, which the animal inserts into the substance, whether\r\nanimal or vegetable, the juices of which form its nutriment. These\r\npieces are dilated at their base, and serrated at their apex; and the\r\ntwo central ones, though at their origin they are asunder, form one\r\ntube, which has often been mistaken for a single piece. A _pharynx_\r\nand _tongue_ have been discovered by M. Savigny in this apparatus;\r\nwho thinks that in _Nepa_ there are also rudiments, but very\r\nindistinct, of _labial palpi_: so that the _maxillary palpi_ seem to\r\nbe the only part absolutely wanting[1370].\r\n\r\nThe _Promuscis_ when at rest is usually laid between the legs; but\r\nwhen employed, in most cases its direction is outward. In the genus\r\n_Chermes_ L. (_Psylla_ Latr.) the origin of the _promuscis_ has\r\nbeen supposed to be in the _breast_; but if closely examined, this\r\nanomaly in nature will be found not to exist. If you take one of\r\nthese insects, the first thing that strikes you upon inspecting the\r\nhead, is a pair of remarkable conical processes into which the front\r\nappears to be divided. Look below these, and you will there discover\r\nthe upper-lip: and from this you may follow the _promuscis_ till it\r\ngets beyond the forelegs, when it takes a direction perpendicular\r\nto the body[1371]; a circumstance which has given rise to the above\r\nfalse notion. Though in _Coccus_, _Chermes_, &c. this instrument is\r\nshort, in some _Aphides_ it is longer in proportion than in any other\r\ninsect. In _A. Quercus_ it is three times the length of the body; so\r\nthat when folded, it stretches out beyond it, and looks like a long\r\ntail[1372]; and in _A. Abietis_ it even exceeds that length[1373].\r\n\r\n\r\nii. _Proboscis_[1374].--Linné long since, and after him Fabricius,\r\nhas employed this term to designate the oral instruments, or rather\r\ntheir sheath, in the _Muscidæ_ and some others, calling the same\r\norgan, when without fleshy lips, _rostrum_ and _haustellum_: but\r\nas the parts of the mouth in all true _Diptera_ (for _Hippobosca_\r\nand its affinities can scarcely be deemed as co-ordinate with the\r\nrest), are analogous to each other; although in some they are stiff\r\nand rigid, in others flexile and soft, and in _Œstrus_ (except the\r\npalpi) mere rudiments,--the same appellation ought to designate them\r\nall. I am happy to find that M. Latreille agrees with me in this\r\nopinion; and to his sensible observations on this head, if you wish\r\nfor further information, I refer you[1375]. The mouth of Dipterous\r\ninsects appears to vary in the number of pieces that it presents;\r\nbut in all, the _theca_ or sheath is present, which represents the\r\n_labium_ (including the _mentum_) of the mandibulate Orders[1376].\r\nIt consists of _three_ joints, the last of which is formed by the\r\nliplets (_Labella_). Those in the _Muscidæ_ are large, turgid,\r\nvesiculose, and capable of dilatation; in the _Bombylidæ_ and other\r\ntribes they are small, slender, long and leathery, and sometimes\r\nrecurved. The second joint or stalk, which may be said to represent\r\nthe _mentum_, the liplets being properly in a restricted sense\r\nthe analogue of the _labium_, its sides being turned up, forms a\r\nlongitudinal cavity, which contains the _haustellum_. The upper piece\r\nof this, the _valvula_, is long, rigid, and very sharp, representing\r\nthe _labrum_[1377]. Beneath this cover, in the above cavity, are the\r\nlancets; which, as far as they are at present known, vary in number\r\nand form: sometimes there are _five_ of them, sometimes _four_,\r\nsometimes _two_, and sometimes, it should seem, only _one_[1378]. In\r\nthe gnat (_Culex_) they are finer than a hair, very sharp, and barbed\r\noccasionally on one side[1379]; in the horse-fly (_Tabanus_ L.) they\r\nare flat and sharp like the blade of a knife or lancet[1380]. In\r\nthis tribe the upper pair, or the knives (_Cultelli_), represent the\r\n_mandibles_; the lower pair, or the lancets (_Scalpella_), usually\r\npalpigerous, the _maxillæ_; and the central one the _tongue_. In the\r\nhorse-fly Reaumur has figured only _four_, exclusive of the _labrum_\r\nand _labium_; but in a specimen I have preserved there appear to be\r\n_five_, one of which, as slender as a hair, I regard as the analogue\r\nof the tongue[1381].--When the lancets are reduced to two, they\r\nprobably represent the _maxillæ_, the mandibles being absorbed in the\r\n_labrum_; and where there is only one, the maxillæ also are absorbed\r\nby the _labium_, which then bears the palpi, the lancet representing\r\nthe tongue[1382]. The lancets are so constructed in many cases, as\r\nto be able by their union to form a tube proper for suction, or\r\nrather for forcing the fluid by the pressure of the lower parts to\r\nthe _pharynx_[1383]. _Labial palpi_ appear not usually present in the\r\n_proboscis_; but M. Savigny thinks he has discovered vestiges of them\r\nin _Tabanus_[1384]. In this genus the maxillary ones are large, and\r\nconsist of _two_ joints[1385]. The proboscis is often so folded, as\r\nto form two elbows; the base forming an angle with the stalk, and the\r\nlatter with the lips, so as in shape to represent the letter Z, only\r\nthat the upper angle points to the breast, and the lower one to the\r\nmouth: this is the case with the flesh-fly and many others. In other\r\nflies, as _Conops_ and _Stomoxys_, whose punctures on our legs so\r\ntorment us[1386], there is only a single fold, with its angle to the\r\nbreast. The _proboscis_ is received in a large oblong cavity of the\r\nunderside of the anterior part of the head.\r\n\r\nIt may here be observed, that in the _promuscis_ the elongation\r\nof the organs seems to be made chiefly at the expense of _all_ the\r\npalpi, but in the _proboscis_ at that of the _labial_ only; and in\r\nsome cases at that also of the _mandibles_ or _maxillæ_;--the former\r\nmerging in the _labrum_ and the latter in the _labium_.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. _Antlia_[1387].--The _third_ kind of imperfect mouth is that\r\nof the _Lepidoptera_, which I have called _Antlia_. Fabricius\r\ndenominates it _lingua_: but as this organ has no analogy with the\r\nreal tongue of insects, this is confessedly improper, and it appeared\r\nnecessary therefore to exchange it for another denomination: I\r\nhave endeavoured to apply a term to it that indicates its use--to\r\npump up, namely, the nectar of the flowers into the mouth of the\r\ninsect. On a former occasion I described to you the structure of\r\nthis instrument[1388]; but further discoveries with regard to it\r\nhaving since been made by MM. Savigny and Latreille, I shall here\r\ngive you the result of their observations. The former of these\r\nable physiologists has detected in the mouth of the _Lepidoptera_\r\nrudiments of almost all the parts of a perfect mouth. Of the\r\ncorrectness of this assertion you may satisfy yourself, if you\r\nconsult his admirable elucidatory plates, and compare them with the\r\ninsects. Just above the origin of the spiral tongue or pump, the head\r\nis a little prominent and rounded; and immediately below the middle\r\nof this prominence there is a very minute, membranous, triangular or\r\nsemicircular piece; which from its position, as covering the base of\r\nthe _antlia_, may be regarded as the rudiment of the _upper-lip_\r\n(_labrum_)[1389]. On each side of the outer base of the _antlia_ is\r\nanother small immoveable piece, resembling a flattened tubercle,\r\nthe end of which is internally hairy or scaly: these pieces appear\r\nto represent the _mandibles_[1390]. Near the base of each half\r\nof the _antlia_, just below a sinus, may be distinctly seen the\r\nminute, usually biarticulate rudiment of a _maxillary palpus_[1391];\r\ndemonstrating to a certainty that these spiral organs, at least their\r\nlateral tubes or _Solenaria_, are real maxillæ[1392]. The rudiment\r\nof the _under-lip_ (_Labium_) is the almost horny triangular piece\r\nunited by membrane to the two stalks of the maxillæ, and supporting\r\nat its base the recurved labial palpi; which are so well known\r\nthat I need not enlarge upon them[1393]. Amongst these parts there\r\nseems at first sight no representative of the _tongue_; but M.\r\nLatreille has advanced some very ingenious, and I think satisfactory\r\narguments[1394], which go to prove that this part, at least the\r\ntongue of _Hymenoptera_, has its analogue in the intermediate tube or\r\n_Fistula_ formed by the union of the two maxillæ, and which conveys\r\nthe fluid aliment of this Order to the _pharynx_. As in _Diptera_\r\nthe _maxillæ_ sometimes merge in the _labium_, so here the _tongue_\r\n(as it were divided longitudinally) merges in the _maxillæ_. He\r\nfurther observes, that in a transverse section of the maxilla of the\r\ndeath's-head hawk-moth (_Sphinx Atropos_), the lateral tube appeared\r\nto be divided into two by a membranous partition, and to contain\r\nin the upper cavity a small cylindrical tube, which seemed to be a\r\n_trachea_[1395]. To animals that are without lungs, and breathe by\r\n_tracheæ_, suction must be performed in a very different way from\r\nwhat it is by those that breathe by the _mouth_: and as in the very\r\nextended organs in question the fluid has a long space to pass before\r\nit reaches the _pharynx_, in some way or other these lateral tubes\r\nmay have the power of producing a vacuum in the middle tube, and so\r\nfacilitate its passage thither. We see, in the _antlia_, that the\r\nmaxillæ receive their vast elongation at the expense of all the other\r\norgans, except the _labial palpi_.\r\n\r\n\r\niv. _Rostrulum_[1396].--An animal very annoying to us affords the\r\ntype of the next kind of imperfect mouth--I mean the _flea_. Its oral\r\napparatus, which I would name _rostrulum_, appears to consist of\r\n_seven_ pieces. First are a pair of triangular organs, the _laminæ_,\r\nwhich together somewhat resemble the beak of a bird, and are affixed,\r\none on each side of the mouth, under the antennæ: these represent\r\nthe _mandibles_ of a perfect mouth[1397]. Next, a pair of long sharp\r\nlancets (_Scalpella_), which emerge from the head below the laminæ:\r\nthese are analogous to _maxillæ_[1398]: a pair of palpi, consisting\r\nof four joints, are attached to these near their base[1399], which\r\nof course are _maxillary palpi_. And lastly, in the midst of all is\r\na slender setiform organ (_ligula_), which is the counterpart of\r\nthe _tongue_[1400]. Rösel, and after him Latreille, seem to have\r\noverlooked this last piece, since they reckon only _six_ pieces\r\nin the flea's mouth[1401]: but the hand and eye of our friend\r\nCurtis have detected a _seventh_, as you see in his figure. From\r\nthis account it appears, that the elongation of the organs of the\r\n_Aphaniptera_ Order is at the expense of the _labium_ and its _palpi_.\r\n\r\n\r\nv. _Rostellum._--So little is known of the composition of the next\r\nkind of imperfect mouth, that I need not enlarge upon it. It is\r\npeculiar to the louse tribe (_Pediculidæ_), and it consists of the\r\ntubulet (_Tubulus_), and siphuncle (_Siphunculus_). The former is\r\nslenderer in the middle than at the base and apex, the latter being\r\nturgid, rather spherical, and armed with claws which probably lay\r\nhold of the skin while the animal is engaged in suction. When not\r\nused, the whole machine is withdrawn within the head; the siphuncle,\r\nwhich is the suctorious part, being first retracted within the\r\ntubulet, in the same way as a snail retracts its _tentacula_[1402].\r\nThis apparatus seems formed at the expense of all the other organs.\r\n\r\nThere are some other kinds of imperfect mouth, which, though they\r\nseem not to merit each a distinct denomination, should not be passed\r\naltogether without notice. The first I shall mention is that of the\r\nfamily of _Pupipara_ Latr. (_Hippobosca_ L.). It consists of a pair\r\nof hairy coriaceous valves, which include a very slender rigid tube\r\nor siphuncle, the instrument of suction, which Latreille describes as\r\nformed by the union of two setiform pieces[1403]. In _Melophagus_,\r\nthe sheep-louse, the union of the valves of the sheath is so short,\r\nthat they appear like a tube; but if cut off they will separate,\r\nand show the siphuncle, as fine as a hair, between them. This organ\r\nis of a type so dissimilar, as was before observed, to that of the\r\n_Diptera_ in general, and approaches so near to that of the dog-tick\r\n(_Ixodes_), that they may be deemed rather apterous insects with two\r\nwings, than to belong to that Order; and the circumstance that some\r\nof the family are apterous confirms this idea. In fact they are a\r\n_transition_ family that connects the two Orders, but are nearest to\r\nthe _Aptera_. In _Nycteribia_ the oral organs differ from those of\r\nthe other _Pupipara_ in having _palpi_. This also is the case with\r\nthose of the genus _Ixodes_, the palpi of which are placed upon the\r\nsame base with the instrument of suction, than which they are longer:\r\nthey appear to consist of _two_ joints, the last very long and flat.\r\nThe instrument of suction itself is formed by three hard rigid\r\nlaminæ; two shorter parallel ones above, that cover the third, which\r\nis longer and broader, and armed on each side with several teeth\r\nlike a saw, having their points towards the base[1404]. Many of the\r\nother _Acari_ L. have mandibles, and several have not: but their oral\r\norgans have not yet been sufficiently examined; and from the extreme\r\nminuteness of most of them, this is no easy task; nor to ascertain in\r\nwhat points they differ or agree.\r\n\r\nIf you consider the general plan of the organs of manducation in the\r\nvertebrate animals, how few are the variations that it admits! An\r\nupper and a lower jaw planted with teeth, or a beak consisting of an\r\nupper or a lower mandible with a central tongue, form its principal\r\nfeatures. But in the little world of insects, how wonderful and\r\ninfinite is the diversity which, as you see, in this respect they\r\nexhibit! Consider the number of the organs, the varying forms of\r\neach in the different tribes, adjusted for nice variations in their\r\nuses:--how gradual, too, the transition from one to another! how one\r\nset of instruments is adapted to prepare the food for deglutition by\r\nmastication; another merely to lacerate it, so that its juices can\r\nbe expressed; a third to lap a fluid aliment; a fourth to imbibe it\r\nby suction--and you will see and acknowledge in all the hand of an\r\nalmighty and all-bountiful CREATOR, and glorify his wisdom, power,\r\nand goodness, so conspicuously manifested in the structure of the\r\nmeanest of his creatures. You will see also, that all things are\r\ncreated after a pre-conceived plan; in which there is a regular and\r\nmeasured transition from one form to another, not only with respect\r\nto beings themselves, but also to their organs--no new organ being\r\nproduced without a gradual approach to it; so that scarcely any\r\nchange takes place that is violent and unexpected, and for which the\r\nway is not prepared by intermediate gradations. And when you further\r\nconsider, that every being, with its every organ, is exactly fitted\r\nfor its functions; and that every being has an office assigned, upon\r\nthe due execution of which the welfare, in certain respects, of this\r\nwhole system depends, you will clearly perceive that this whole plan,\r\nintire in all its parts, must have been coeval with the Creation; and\r\nthat all the species,--subject to those variations only that climate\r\nand different food produce,--have remained essentially the same, or\r\nthey would not have answered the end for which they were made, from\r\nthat time to this.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving given you this particular account of the _trophi_ or organs\r\nof the mouth of insects, I must now make some observations upon the\r\n_other_ parts of the head. I have divided it, as you see in the\r\nTable, into _face_ and _subface_; the former including its _upper_\r\nand the latter its _lower_ surface. Strictly speaking, some parts of\r\nthe face, as the temples and cheeks, are common to both surfaces; but\r\nI do not therefore reckon them as belonging to the subface, which,\r\nexclusive of the mouth and its organs, consists only of the _throat_,\r\nand where there is a neck, the _gula_.\r\n\r\ni. _Nasus_[1405].--I shall consider the parts of the face in the\r\norder in which they stand in the Table, beginning with the _nasus_\r\nor nose. Fabricius has denominated this part the _clypeus_, in which\r\nhe has been followed by most modern Entomologists. You may therefore\r\nthink, perhaps, that I have here unnecessarily altered a term so\r\ngenerally adopted, and expect that I assign some sufficient reasons\r\nfor such a change. I have before hinted that there is good ground\r\nfor thinking that the sense of _smell_ in insects resides somewhere\r\nin the vicinity of this part; and when I come to treat of their\r\nsenses, I shall produce at large those arguments that have induced\r\nme to adopt this opinion: and if I can make out this satisfactorily,\r\nyou will readily allow the propriety of the denomination. I shall\r\nhere only state those _secondary_ reasons for the term, which, in\r\nmy idea, prove that it is much more to the purpose than _clypeus_.\r\nThis last word was originally applied by Linné in a metaphorical\r\nsense to the ample covering of the head of the _Scarabæidæ_, and the\r\nthoracic shield of _Silpha_, _Cassida_, _Lampyris_, and _Blatta_: in\r\nall which cases there was a propriety in the figurative use of it,\r\nbecause of the resemblance of the parts so illustrated to a _shield_.\r\nBut when _Fabricius_ (though he sometimes employs the term, as Linné\r\ndid, merely for illustration,) admitted it into his orismological\r\ntable, as a term to represent universally the anterior part of the\r\nface of insects to which the labrum is attached (though in some\r\ncases he designates the _labrum_ itself by this name), it became\r\nextremely inappropriate; since in every case, except that of the\r\n_Scarabæidæ_, the part has no pretension to be called a _shield_;--so\r\nthat the term is rather calculated to mislead than illustrate. This\r\nimpropriety seems at length to have struck M. Latreille, since in a\r\nlate essay[1406] he has changed the name of this part to _Epistomis_,\r\na term signifying _the part above the mouth_. But there are reasons,\r\nexclusive of those hereafter to be produced concerning the sense of\r\nsmell, which seem to me to prove that _nasus_ is a preferable term;\r\nnot to mention its claim of priority, as having been used to signify\r\nthis part a century ago[1407]. When we come to consider the terms for\r\nthe other parts of the head, as _lips_, _jaws_, _tongue_, _eyes_,\r\n_temples_, _cheeks_, _forehead_, &c. the concinnity, if I may so\r\nspeak, and harmony of our technical language, seem to require that\r\nthe part analogous in point of situation to the _nose_ of vertebrate\r\nanimals should bear the same name. And any person who had never\r\nexamined an insect before, if asked to point out the _nose_ of the\r\nanimal, would immediately cast his eye upon this part: so that one\r\nof the principal uses of imposing names upon parts--that they might\r\nbe more readily known--would be attained. If it is objected, that\r\ncalling a part a _nose_ that has not the sense of smell, supposing it\r\nto be so, might lead to mistakes--I would answer, that this objection\r\nis not regarded as valid in other cases: for instance, the _maxillæ_\r\nare not generally used as _jaws_, and yet no one objects to the term;\r\nbecause, from their situation, they evidently have an analogy to the\r\norgans whose name they bear. But enough on this subject--we will now\r\nconsider the part itself.\r\n\r\nTo enable you to distinguish the nose of insects when it is not\r\nseparated from the rest of the face by an impressed line, you must\r\nobserve that it is the terminal middle part that sometimes overhangs\r\nthe upper-lip, and at others is nearly in the same line with it; that\r\non each side of it are the cheeks, which run from the anterior half\r\nof the eyes to the base of the mandibles. Just below the antennæ is\r\nsometimes another part distinct from the nose, which I shall soon have\r\nto mention; so that the nose must not be regarded as reaching always\r\nnearly to the base or insertion of the antennæ, since it sometimes\r\noccupies only half the space between them and the upper-lip, which\r\nspace is marked out by an impressed line. But you will not always be\r\nleft at such uncertainty when you want to ascertain the limits of\r\nthe nose; for it is in many cases a distinct piece, separated by an\r\nelevated or impressed line from the rest of the face. This separation\r\nis either partial or universal. Take any species of the genera\r\n_Copris_, _Onitis_, or _Ateuchus_, and you will see the nose marked\r\nout in the centre of the anterior part of the face by two _elevated_\r\nlines, forming nearly a triangle and bounded by the horn[1408]. Or\r\ntake a common wasp or hornet, and you will find a similar space,\r\nthough approaching to a quadrangular figure, marked out by _impressed_\r\nlines[1409]. In _Rhagio_ and _Sciara_, two Dipterous genera, this\r\nimpression is so deep as to look like a suture. Between these lines,\r\nin those cases, is included what I call the _nose_. As to _substance_,\r\nin general it does not differ from the rest of the head; but in the\r\n_Cleridæ_ it is almost membranous. You must observe, that in all these,\r\nwhat at first sight appears to be the termination of the front, is not\r\nthe nose, but the narrow depressed piece that intervenes between it\r\nand the lip. With regard to its _clothing_, it is most commonly naked,\r\nbut in some genera it is covered with hair; in _Crabro_ F. often with\r\ngolden or silver pile, which imparts a singular brilliance to the mouth\r\nof the insects of that genus: M. Latreille supposes that the brilliant\r\ncolours of the golden-wasp (_Chrysis_ L.) may dazzle their enemies,\r\nand so _promote_ their escape[1410]; the brilliance of the mouth of\r\nthe _Crabro_ may on the contrary at first dazzle their prey for a\r\nmoment, so as to _prevent_ their escape. The _form_ of the nose, where\r\ndistinct from the rest of the face, admits of several variations: thus\r\nin the _Staphylinidæ_ and _Cleridæ_ it is transverse and linear; in\r\n_Copris_ it is triangular, with the vertex of the triangle truncated;\r\nin _Vespa Crabro_ it is subquadrate and sinuated. In many Heteromerous\r\nbeetles[1411] it is rounded posteriorly: in _Pelecotoma_, a new genus\r\nin this tribe, related to _Asida_, there is a deep anterior sinus; in\r\n_Blaps_ the anterior margin is concave; in _Cetonia_[1412] _Brownii_,\r\nand _atropunctata_ (forming a distinct subgenus), it is bifid: it\r\nvaries in the _Scarabæidæ_, in some being bidentate, in others\r\nquadridentate, and in others again sexdentate, including the cheeks:\r\nin _Mylabris_, a kind of blister-beetle, it is transverse and nearly\r\noval; in _Lamia_, a capricorn-beetle, it represents a parallelogram;\r\nand in most _Orthoptera_ it is subtriangular: in _Tettigonia_ F. it\r\nis prominent, transversely furrowed, and divided by a longitudinal\r\nchannel: in _Otiocerus_ K. it presents the longitudinal section of\r\na cone[1413]: in the _Diptera_ Order, with the exception of the\r\n_Tipulidæ_ and some others, in which it unites with the cheeks, &c. to\r\nform a rostrum, the nose in general, as to _form_, answers to its name,\r\nresembling that of many of the _Mammalia_: in some of the _Asilidæ_\r\nit is very tumid at the end, and terminates in a sinus, to permit\r\nthe passage of the proboscis to and fro: in many of the _Syrphidæ_,\r\n&c. it is first flat and depressed, and then is suddenly elevated,\r\nso as to give the animal's head the air of that of a monkey: in some\r\ntribes, as _Rhingia_, _Nemotelus_, _Eristalis_, &c., in conjunction\r\nwith the cheeks it forms a conical rostrum: in _Tabanus bovinus_, and\r\nother horse-flies, it terminates in three angles or teeth. Many more\r\nforms might be mentioned, but these will suffice to give you a general\r\nidea of them. In _size_ and _proportions_ the nose also varies. It\r\nis frequently, as in _Tettigonia_, the most conspicuous part of the\r\nface, both for size and characters; but in the _Staphylinidæ_ it is\r\nvery small, and often scarcely discernible, being overshadowed by its\r\nample front: and it may be observed in general, that when the antennæ\r\napproximate the mouth, as in this genus and many others, the _front_\r\nbecomes _ample_, and the _nose_ is reduced to its _minimum_: but when\r\nthey are distant from the mouth, the reverse takes place; and the\r\nnose is at its _maximum_ and the front at its _minimum_. _Mutilla_,\r\n_Myrmecodes_, _Scolia_, &c. in the _Hymenoptera_, are an example of\r\nthe former; and the _Pompilidæ_, _Sphecidæ_, _Vespidæ_, &c. of the\r\nlatter. In _Myopa buccata_, &c. its length exceeds its width; but more\r\ncommonly the reverse takes place. The _circumscription_ of the _nose_\r\nalso deserves attention. It is usually terminated behind by the front\r\n(_frons_), or, where it exists, by the _postnasus_, in the sides by the\r\ncheeks, and anteriorly by the _labrum_. But this is not invariably the\r\ncase; for in the _Cimicidæ_, in which the cheeks form the bed of the\r\n_Promuscis_, the front embraces it on each side by means of two lateral\r\nprocesses, that sometimes meet or lap over each other anteriorly, which\r\ngives the nose the appearance of being insulated; but it really dips\r\nbelow these lobes to join the _labrum_. This structure you may see in\r\n_Edessa_ F., and many other bugs. This part sometimes has its _arms_.\r\nThus in _Copris_, and many _Dynastidæ_, the horns of the head seem, in\r\npart at least, to belong to this portion of it; in _Tipula oleracea_\r\n(the crane-fly), &c. it terminates before in a horizontal mucro. In\r\n_Osmia cornuta_, a kind of wild-bee, each side of the nose is armed\r\nwith a vertical horn. The _margin_ of the nose in most Lamellicorn\r\ninsects, though mostly level, curves upwards.\r\n\r\nI am next to mention a part of the nose which merits a distinct\r\nname and notice, which I conceive in some sort to be analogous to\r\nthe _nostrils_ of quadrupeds, and which I have therefore named the\r\n_Rhinarium_ or nostril-piece. I had originally distinguished it by\r\nthe plural term _nares_, nostrils; but as it is usually a single\r\npiece, I thought it best to denote it by one in the singular. When\r\nI treat of the senses of insects, I shall give you my reasons, as I\r\nhave before said, for considering this part as the organ of scent,\r\nor connected with it, which you will then be able to appreciate.\r\nI shall only here observe, that the piece in question is in the\r\nusual situation of the nostrils--between the nose and the lip.\r\nIn a large number of insects this part may be regarded as nearly\r\nobsolete; or at least it is merely represented by the very narrow\r\nmembranous line that intervenes between the nose and the lip and\r\nconnects them; which, as in the case of the head of _Harpali_\r\nbefore noticed, may be capable of tension and relaxation, and so\r\npresent a greater surface to the action of the atmosphere. But I\r\noffer this as mere conjecture. In the lady-bird (_Coccinella_) this\r\nline is a little wider, and becomes a distinct _Rhinarium_; as it\r\ndoes also in _Geotrupes_. With respect to its _insertion_, the\r\n_rhinarium_ is a piece that either entirely separates the nose from\r\nthe lip, or only partially: the former is the most common structure.\r\nIt is particularly remarkable in a New Holland genus of chafers\r\n(_Anoplognathus_ Leach). In _A. viridiæncus_ it is very ample, and\r\nforms the under side of the recurved nose, so that a large space\r\nintervenes between the margin of the latter and the base of the\r\n_labrum_. In _Macropus_ Thunb., of the Capricorn tribe (_Cerambyx_\r\nL.), the nostril-piece, which forms a distinct segment, is narrower\r\nthan the nose, and the upper-lip than the nostril-piece, forming as\r\nit were a triple gradation from the front to the mouth. Again, in\r\nothers the part in question is received into a sinus of the nose.\r\nThis is the case with the dragon-flies (_Libellulina_), in which this\r\nsinus is very wide; in the burying-beetle (_Necrophorus_)[1414], in\r\nsome species of which it is deep but narrow; and in a species of\r\n_Tenebrio_ from New Holland, which perhaps would make a subgenus.\r\nIf you examine with a common glass any of the larger rove-beetles\r\n(_Staphylinidæ_), you will find that the nose itself seems lost in\r\nthe nostril-piece, both together forming a very narrow line across\r\nthe head above the _labrum_, without any apparent distinction between\r\nthem; but if you have recourse to a higher magnifier, you will find\r\nthis divided into an upper and lower part, the former of the hard\r\nsubstance of the rest of the head, and the latter membranous. I once\r\nwas of opinion that the prominent transversely furrowed part, so\r\nconspicuous in the face of _Tettigonia_ F.[1415], was the _front_:\r\nbut upon considering the situation of this, chiefly below the eyes\r\nand antennæ, and comparing it with the analogous piece in _Fulgora\r\nlaternaria_ and other insects of the Homopterous section of the\r\n_Hemiptera_, I incline to think that it represents the _nose_, and\r\nthat the longitudinal ridge below it is the nostril-piece[1416].\r\nIn the Heteropterous section it is merely the vertical termination\r\nof their narrow nose. In other insects again, this part approaches\r\nin some measure to the common idea of nostrils; there being _two_,\r\neither one on each side the nose, or two approximated ones. If you\r\ncatch the first humble-bee that you see busy upon a flower, you will\r\ndiscover a minute membranous protuberance under each angle of the\r\nnose. Something similar may be observed in some species of _Asilus_\r\nL. In the _Orthoptera_, especially in _Blatta_, _Phasma_, and some\r\n_Locustæ_, two roundish or square pieces, close to each other on the\r\nlower part of the nose, represent the nostrils[1417].--With regard to\r\n_substance_, in the chafer-tribes, at least those that feed on leaves\r\nor living vegetable matter, as the _Melolonthidæ_, _Anoplognathidæ_,\r\nand in many other insects, the _rhinarium_ is of the same substance\r\nwith the rest of the head; but in _Macropus_ Thunb., _Staphylinus_,\r\n_Necrophorus_, &c., it consists of membrane.\r\n\r\nii. _Postnasus_[1418].--This is a part that appears to have been\r\nconfounded by Entomologists with the front of insects; in general,\r\nindeed, it may be regarded as included in the nose, and does not\r\nrequire separate notice: but there are many cases in which it is\r\ndistinctly marked out and set by itself, and in which it forms a\r\nuseful diagnostic of genera or subgenera. There is a very splendid and\r\nbeautiful Chinese beetle, to be seen in most collections of foreign\r\ninsects (_Sagra purpurea_), in which this part forms a striking\r\nfeature, and helps to distinguish the genus from its near neighbour\r\n_Donacia_. If you examine its face, you will discover a triangular\r\npiece, below the antennæ and above the _nasus_, separated from the\r\nlatter and from the front by a deeply-impressed line: this is the\r\n_postnasus_ or _after-nose_. Again: if you examine any specimens of a\r\nHymenopterous genus called by Fabricius _Prosopis_ (_Hylæus_ Latr.),\r\nremarkable for its scent of baum, you will find a similar triangle\r\nmarked out in a similar situation[1419]. In many Coleopterous\r\ninsects, besides _Sagra_, you will discover traces of the part we are\r\nconsidering: as in _Anthia_, _Dytiscus_, and several others of the\r\nPredaceous beetles. In _Cistela_ it is larger than the nose itself;\r\nbut it is more conspicuous in the _Orthoptera_, particularly in\r\n_Locusta_ (_Gryllus_ F.), in which it is the space below the antennæ,\r\ndistinguished by two or four rather diverging ridges[1420]. In the\r\n_Libellulina_, _Myrmeleonina_, &c. it is a distinct transverse piece.\r\nIn _Dasyga_ Latr., a kind of bee, it is armed with a transverse ridge\r\nor horn--But enough has been said to render you acquainted with it; I\r\nshall therefore proceed to the next piece.\r\n\r\niii. _Frons_[1421].--The _Front_ of insects may be denominated the\r\n_middle_ part of the face between the eyes, bounded anteriorly by the\r\nnose, or after-nose, where it exists, and the cheeks; laterally by\r\nthe eyes; and posteriorly by the vertex. Speaking properly, it is the\r\nregion of the _antennæ_; though when these organs are placed before\r\nthe eyes, under the margin of the nose, as in many Lamellicorn and\r\nHeteromerous beetles, they seem to be rather _nasal_ than _frontal_.\r\nThis part is often elevated, as in the elastic beetles (_Elater_),\r\nwhose faculty of jumping, by means of a pectoral spring, has been\r\nrelated to you[1422]. In _Anthia_, a Predaceous beetle, it has\r\noften three longitudinal ridges. In many of the Capricorn beetles\r\n(_Cerambyx_ L.), it is nearly in the shape of a Calvary cross, with\r\nthe arms forming an obtuse angle, and then terminating at the sinus\r\nof the eyes in an elevation for the site of the antennæ. In the\r\nants also (_Formicidæ_), the front is often elevated between those\r\norgans. In _Ponera_, one tribe of them, this elevation is bilobed,\r\nand receives between its lobes the vertex of the _postnasus_. In\r\nthe hornet (_Vespa Crabro_) the elevation is a triangle, with its\r\nvertex towards the mouth. In _Sagra_ it is marked out into three\r\ntriangles, the _postnasus_ making a fourth, with the vertexes\r\nmeeting in the centre. In the _Dynastidæ_ and _Scarabæidæ_ the\r\nhorns are often _frontal_ appendages, as is that of _Empusa_ Latr.,\r\na leaf-insect, and probably those of _Sphinx Iatrophæ_ F., which\r\naffords a singular instance of a horned Lepidopterous one. Sometimes\r\nit is an ample space, reducing the nose to a very narrow line, as in\r\nthe _Staphylinidæ_, or sending forth a lobe on each side, as before\r\nmentioned, which embraces the nose. In a species of bug from Brazil,\r\nrelated to _Aradus_ F., these lobes are dilated, foliaceous, and\r\nmeet before the nose, so as to form a remarkable extended frontlet\r\nto the head. In others this part is extremely minute: thus in many\r\n_male_ flies and other insects, as the _Libellulina_, where the\r\neyes touch each other, the front is cut off from the vertex and\r\nreduced to a small angle. In the female flies the communication\r\nwith the vertex is kept open, and the front consequently longer.\r\nIn the horse-flies (_Tabanidæ_), in _Hæmatopota_, and _Heptatoma_,\r\nthe frontal space is wider than in the rest of that tribe. Many\r\nof these are distinguished by a levigated area behind the antennæ\r\nin the part we are treating of. In the _Libellulina_, and in the\r\ndrone-bee, whose eyes are confluent, the stemmata are in the front.\r\nIn many _Orthoptera_ also, as _Locusta_ Leach, one of them is below\r\nthe antennæ; and in the lanthorn-fly tribe (_Fulgoridæ_), both these\r\norgans, which are situate between them and the eyes, as they do also\r\nin _Truxalis_, appear to be in it[1423]. In this tribe the rostrum is\r\nan elongation of the part in question; and perhaps you would think\r\nat first that what I have considered as the _nose_ in _Tettigonia_\r\nF. was also a tendency to this kind of rostrum; but if you examine\r\nthe great lanthorn-fly (_Fulgora laternaria_), you will find besides,\r\nat the lower base of the lanthorn, a triangular piece analogous to\r\nthe nose of _Tettigonia_, and below it another representing its\r\nnostril-piece:--the horizontal part of the nose in that genus may\r\nperhaps be regarded as part of the front. In _Truxalis_ F. the face\r\nconsists of a supine and prone surface, and the latter is composed\r\nof the front, after-nose, nose, and organs of the mouth. I may\r\nnotice here a most remarkable and singular tribe of bugs, of which\r\ntwo species have been figured by Stoll[1424]: in these the head,\r\nor rather those parts of it that we have now been describing, the\r\nnose, namely, the after-nose, and front, are absolutely divided\r\nlongitudinally in two, each half having an eye and antenna planted in\r\nit; or perhaps, as it is stated to be divided in one instance to the\r\ncommencement of the _promuscis_, the nose is left intire, and dips\r\ndown, as in cases before alluded to: so that in this the nose appears\r\nto leave the lobes of the front, which in others embrace its sides.\r\n\r\niv. _Vertex_[1425].--We now come to the _vertex_, or crown of the head;\r\nwhich is situated behind the front, and, except where the communication\r\nis intercepted by confluent eyes, adjoins it. It is laterally bounded\r\nby the hind part of the eyes and the temples; and _posteriorly_, where\r\nthat part exists, by the _occiput_. The vertex may be denominated the\r\nordinary region of the _stemmata_: for though in several cases, as\r\nwe have just seen, one or more of them are planted in the front; yet\r\nthis in the great majority, especially in the _Hymenoptera_, is their\r\nnatural station. In _Blatta_ and some other _Orthoptera_ the posterior\r\nangle of the head is the vertex. In many dung-chafers of Latreille's\r\ngenus _Onthophagus_, which are said to have _occipital_ horns, as _O.\r\nnutans_, _nuchicornis_, _Xiphias_, &c., the horn really arms the part\r\nI regard as the vertex. In _Locusta_ Leach, this part is very ample,\r\nand in _Truxalis_ very long; but more generally it is small, and not\r\nrequiring particular notice.\r\n\r\nv. _Occiput_[1426].--The _occiput_, or _hind-head_, is that part of\r\nthe face that either forms an angle with the vertex posteriorly,\r\nor slopes downwards from it. It has for its lateral boundaries the\r\ntemples, and behind it is either terminated by the orifice of the\r\nhead, or in many cases by the neck. In those beetles that have no\r\nneck, as the Lamellicorn and Capricorn, the hind-head is merely a\r\ndeclivity from the vertex, usually concealed by the shield of the\r\nthorax, very lubricous, to facilitate its motion in the cavity of\r\nthat part, and at its posterior margin distinguished by one or two\r\nnotches, which I shall notice hereafter, for the attachment of the\r\nlevator muscles: but in those beetles or other insects that have\r\na neck, or a versatile head, the occiput forms an angle with the\r\nvertex, often rounded, and sometimes acute. This structure may be\r\nseen in Latreille's _Trachelides_, and several other beetles. In the\r\n_Hymenoptera_, _Diptera_, and others with a versatile head, the part\r\nnow under consideration curves inwards from the vertical line, so\r\nas with the temples and under parts of the head to form a concavity\r\nadapted to its movement upon the trunk.\r\n\r\nvi. _Genæ_[1427].--The _cheeks_ of insects (_Genæ_) usually surround\r\nthe anterior part of the eyes, and lie between them and the mandibles\r\nor their representatives. Where they approach the latter, as in the\r\nPredaceous beetles (_Cicindela_, _Carabus_ L. &c.), they are very\r\nshort, and of course longer where the eyes are further removed from\r\nthe mouth; as in the Rhyncophorous beetles (_Curculio_ L.), where\r\nthey form the sides of the rostrum, and often contain a channel which\r\nreceives the first joint of the antennæ, when they are unemployed.\r\nIn the _Scarabæidæ_ and many other Lamellicorn beetles, their\r\nseparation on each side from the nose is marked by a ridge[1428];\r\nand in the wasps (_Vespa_) by an impressed line or channel. In an\r\nAfrican tribe at present arranged with _Cetonia_ F., to which _C.\r\nbicornis_ Latr.[1429] and another, which he has named, I believe, _C.\r\nvitticollis_, belong, the cheeks are porrected on each side of the\r\nmouth into a horizontal horn. These horns have at first the aspect\r\nof a pair of open mandibles. In the magnificent _Goliathi_ Lam.,\r\nthe horns of the male are rather a process of the _cheek_ than of\r\nthe _nose_. In _Alurnus_, _Hispa_, and other beetles, these parts,\r\nby their elevation and conjunction with the lower side of the head,\r\nform a kind of fence which surrounds and protects the oral organs;\r\nin many _Cimicidæ_, by a similar elevation of the cheeks, the bed\r\nof the _promuscis_ is formed. In the Homopterous _Hemiptera_ they\r\nrun parallel nearly with the _rhinarium_ or nostril-piece. In the\r\n_Hymenoptera_ they are almost always ample, but they are confined\r\nto the lower side of the eye. In _Sirex grandis_, and others of\r\nthat genus, the cheek at the base of the mandible is dilated so\r\nas to form a rounded tooth below it. In the Capricorn-beetles it\r\nis considerable, and sometimes terminates, at the base of the\r\nmandible, in two or three notches. In _Scaurus_ and _Eurychora_,\r\ndarkling-beetles, the cheek below projects into a lobe that covers\r\nthe base of the _maxilla_. But the animal distinguished by the\r\nmost remarkable cheeks is a species of _Phryganea_ L. (_Phryganea\r\npersonata_ Spence); for from this part projects a spoon-shaped\r\nprocess, which curves upwards, and uniting with that of the other\r\ncheek, forms an ample mask before the face, the anterior and upper\r\nmargin of which, in the insect's natural state, are closely united;\r\nand the posterior part being applied to the anterior part of the\r\neye, causes the face to appear much swoln. It looks as if it was a\r\nsingle piece; but upon pressing the thorax it opens, both above and\r\nin front, into two parts, each convex without and hollow within, and\r\neach having attached to its inside a yellow tuft of hair resembling a\r\nfeather. The use of this machinery at present remains a mystery[1430].\r\n\r\nvii. _Tempora_[1431].--The temples (_Tempora_) are merely a\r\ncontinuation of the cheeks to the posterior limit of the head,\r\nforming its sides and posterior angles, and including the hinder part\r\nof the eyes, the vertex, and the occiput. They seldom exhibit any\r\ntangible character, except in certain ants (_Atta_ Latr.), in which\r\ntheir angle terminates in one or two strong spines, giving the animal\r\na most ferocious aspect; and in that remarkable genus _Corydalis_\r\nthey are armed below with a tooth or point, which was not overlooked\r\nby De Geer[1432].\r\n\r\nviii. _Oculi_[1433].--I must now call your attention to organs of more\r\nimportance and interest, and which indeed include a world of wonders: I\r\nmean the eyes (_Oculi_) of insects. These differ widely from those of\r\nvertebrate animals, being incapable of motion. They may be regarded as\r\nof _three_ descriptions--_simple_, _conglomerate_, and _compound_.\r\n\r\n1. _Simple Eyes_[1434]. We will consider them as to their _number_,\r\n_structure_, _shape_, _colour_, _magnitude_, _situation_, and\r\n_arrangement_.\r\n\r\nAs to their _number_, they vary from two to sixteen. In the flea,\r\nthe louse, the harvest-man (_Phalangium_), there are only _a pair_;\r\nin the bird-louse of the goose (_Nirmus Anseris_), and probably in\r\nothers of the same genus, there are _four_[1435]; in some spiders\r\n(_Scytodes_, _Dysdera_, and _Segestria_ Latr.[1436]), and some\r\nscorpions[1437], there are _six_. In the majority of spiders and\r\n_Scolopendra morsitans_, _Scorpio maurus_, &c. there are _eight_;\r\nand in _Podura_ and _Sminthurus_ Latr. there are sixteen[1438].\r\n\r\nAs to their _structure_, nothing seems to have been ascertained;\r\nprobably their organization does not materially differ from that of one\r\nof the lenses of a compound eye; which I shall soon explain to you.\r\n\r\nTheir _colour_ in the many is black and shining, but in the\r\nbird-louse of the goose they are quite white and transparent.\r\nIn spiders they are often of a sapphirine colour, and clear as\r\ncrystal. In _Scolopendra morsitans_ and many spiders, scorpions,\r\nand _phalangia_[1439], they appear to consist of iris and pupil,\r\nwhich gives them a fierce glare, the centre of the eye being dark\r\nand the circumference paler. In the celebrated _Tarantula_ (_Lycosa\r\nTarantula_), the pupil is transparent, and red as a ruby; and the\r\niris more opaque, paler, and nearly the colour of amber.\r\n\r\nWhere there are more than two, they vary in _magnitude_. In the\r\nenormous bird-spider (_Mygale avicularia_) the four external eyes\r\nare larger than the four internal[1440]; but in the Tarantula\r\nand _Sphasus_, the _two_ or _four_ internal are the largest. In\r\n_Clubiona_ and _Drassus_ they are all nearly of the same size[1441];\r\nand in the _Micrommata_ family they are very small[1442].\r\n\r\nThey vary also in _shape_. In _Scolopendra morsitans_ the three\r\nanterior ones are round, and the posterior one transverse, and\r\nsomewhat triangular. In _Mygale calpeiana_, a spider, the two\r\nsmallest are round and the rest oval[1443]. In the trapdoor or\r\nmason spider (_Mygale cæmentaria_), the four small internal ones are\r\nround, and the large external ones oval[1444]; and those that are\r\ncircumscribed posteriorly with an impressed semicircle, are shaped\r\nlike the moon when gibbous[1445].\r\n\r\nThe _situation_ and _arrangement_ of simple eyes are also various.\r\nIn many they are imbedded, as usual, in the head; but in the little\r\nscarlet mite, formerly noticed[1446], (_Trombidium holosericeum_),\r\nthey stand upon a small foot-stalk[1447]: the hairiness of this\r\nanimal might otherwise have impeded its sight. In spiders they\r\nare planted on the back of the part that represents the head,\r\nsometimes four on a central elevation or tubercle, and the remaining\r\nfour below it--as in _Lycosa_; sometimes the whole eight are\r\non a tubercle, as in _Mygale_; and sometimes, as in the common\r\ngarden-spider (_Epeira Diadema_), upon three tubercles, four on the\r\ncentral one and two on each of the lateral ones. Other variations\r\nin this respect might be named in this tribe. In the scorpions a\r\npair are placed one on each side, on a dorsal tubercle, and the\r\nother four or six on two lateral ones of the anterior part of the\r\nhead[1448]. In the _Phalangidæ_ the _frontal_ eyes of the scorpion\r\ncease, and only a pair of _dorsal_ ones are inserted vertically\r\nin the sides of a horn or tubercle, either bifid or simple, often\r\nitself standing upon an elevation which emerges from the back of\r\nthe animal[1449]. If their eyes were not in a vertical and elevated\r\nposition, the sight of these insects would be very limited; but by\r\nmeans of the structure just stated, they get a considerable range of\r\nsurrounding objects, as well as of those above them. With regard to\r\nthe _arrangement_ of the eyes we are considering, it varies much.\r\nSometimes they are placed nearly in the segment of a circle, as\r\nin those spiders that have _six_ eyes only, before noticed[1450];\r\nsometimes in two straight lines[1451]; at others in two segments of\r\na circle[1452]; at others, in _three_ lines[1453], and at others\r\nin _four_[1454]. Again, in some instances they form a cross, or\r\ntwo triangles[1455]; in others, two squares[1456]; in others, a\r\nsmaller square included in a large one[1457]; in others, a posterior\r\nsquare and two anterior triangles[1458]; sometimes a square and two\r\nlines. Though generally separate from each other, in several cases\r\ntwo of the eyes touch[1459]; and in one instance three coalesce\r\ninto a triangle[1460]. But it would be endless to mention all the\r\nvariations, as to arrangement, in the eyes of spiders.\r\n\r\n2. _Conglomerate Eyes_[1461] differ in nothing from simple eyes, except\r\nthat instead of being dispersed they are collected into a body, so\r\nas at first sight to exhibit the appearance of a compound eye:--they\r\nare, however, not hexagonal, and are generally convex. They occur\r\nin _Lepisma_, the _Iulidæ_, and several of the _Scolopendridæ_. In\r\n_Scolopendra forficata_ the eye consists of about twenty contiguous,\r\ncircular, pellucid lenses, arranged in five lines, with another larger\r\nbehind them, as a sentinel or scout, placed at some little distance\r\nfrom the main body. In the common millepede (_Iulus terrestris_) there\r\nare twenty-eight of these eyes, placed in seven rows, and forming a\r\ntriangle, thus [Illustration: triangular eye shape]--the posterior row\r\ncontaining seven lenses, the next six, and so on, gradually losing one,\r\ntill the last terminates in unity. Each of these lenses is umbilicated,\r\nor marked with a central depression. In _Craspedosoma_ Leach, you will\r\nfind a similar formation. In _Glomeris zonata_, a kind of wood-louse\r\nthat rolls itself into a ball, the lenses are arranged in a line curved\r\nat the lower end, with a single one by itself at the posterior end on\r\nthe outside; they are oblong and set transversely, and their white\r\nhue and transparency give them the appearance of so many minute gems,\r\nespecially as contrasted with the black colour of the animal[1462].\r\nBetween these eyes and the antennæ is another transverse linear white\r\nbody, but opaque, seemingly set in a socket, and surrounded by a white\r\nelevated line, like the bezel of a ring. Whether it is an eye, or what\r\norgan, I cannot conjecture[1463]. Its aspect is that of a spiracle.\r\n\r\n3. _Compound Eyes_[1464].--These are the most common kind of eye\r\nin hexapod insects, when arrived at their perfect state; in their\r\nlarva state, as we have seen, their eyes being usually simple[1465];\r\nexcept, indeed, those whose metamorphosis is _semicomplete_, which\r\nhave compound eyes in every state.--In considering compound eyes, I\r\nshall advert to their _structure_, _number_, _situation_, _figure_,\r\n_clothing_, _colour_, and _size_.\r\n\r\nAs to their _structure_,--when seen under the microscope they appear\r\nto consist usually of an infinite number of convex _hexagonal_\r\npieces. If you examine with a good glass the eye of any fly, you\r\nwill find it traversed by numberless parallel lines, with others\r\nequally numerous cutting them at right angles, so as apparently to\r\nform myriads of little squares, with each a lens of the above figure\r\nset in it. The same structure, though often not so easily seen,\r\nobtains in the eyes of _Coleoptera_ and other insects. When the eye\r\nis separated and made clean, these hexagons are as clear as crystal.\r\nReaumur fitted one eye to a lens, and could see through it well, but\r\nobjects were greatly multiplied[1466]. In Coleopterous insects they\r\nare of a hard and horny substance; but in _Diptera_, &c. more soft\r\nand membranous. The number of lenses in an eye varies in different\r\ninsects. Hooke computed those in the eye of a horse-fly to amount\r\nto nearly 7,000[1467]; Leeuwenhoeck found more than 12,000 in that\r\nof a dragon-fly[1468]; and 17,325 have been counted in that of a\r\nbutterfly[1469]. But of all insects they seem to be most numerous in\r\nthe beetles of Mr. W. S. MacLeay's genus _Dynastes_. In the eyes of\r\nthese the lenses are so small as not to be easily discoverable even\r\nunder a pocket microscope, except the eye has turned white[1470]: it\r\nis not, therefore, wonderful, that Fabricius should call these eyes\r\n_simple_[1471]. In some insects, however, as in the _Strepsiptera_\r\nKirby, the lenses are not numerous: in _Xenos_ they do not exceed\r\nfifty, and are distinctly visible to the naked eye[1472]. These\r\nlenses vary in magnitude, not only in different, but sometimes in\r\nthe same eyes. This is the case in those of male horse-flies and\r\nflies, those of the upper part of the eye being much larger than\r\nthose of the lower[1473]. The partitions that separate the lenses,\r\nor rather bezels, in which they are set, are very visible in the\r\neyes just mentioned, and those of _Xenos_; but in many insects they\r\nare only discernible at the intersecting lines of separation between\r\nthe lenses. In hairy eyes, such as those of the hive-bee, the hairs\r\nemerge from these _septa_. Every single lens of a compound eye may be\r\nconsidered as a _cornea_, or a _crystalline humour_, it being convex\r\nwithout and concave within, but thicker in the middle than at the\r\nmargin: it is the only transparent part to be found in these most\r\nremarkable eyes. Immediately under the _cornea_ is an opaque varnish,\r\nvarying according to the species, which produces sometimes in one\r\nand the same eye spots or bands of different colours. These spots\r\nand bands form a distinguishing ornament of many of the _Tabani_ and\r\nother flies. And to this varnish the lace-winged flies (_Hemerobius_,\r\n&c.) are indebted for the beautiful metallic hues that often adorn\r\nthem. When insects are dead, this varnish frequently loses its\r\ncolour, and the eye turns white: hence many species are described\r\nas having _white_ eyes which when alive had _black_ ones. The\r\nconsistence of this covering is the same with that of the varnish\r\nof the _choroid_ in the eyes of vertebrate animals; but it entirely\r\ncovers the underside of the lens, without leaving any passage for the\r\nlight. Below this varnish there are numbers of short white hexagonal\r\nprisms[1474], every one of which enters the concavity of one of the\r\nlenses of the cornea, and is only separated from it by the varnish\r\njust described: this may be considered as the _retina_ of the lens\r\nto which it is attached; but at present it has not been clearly\r\nexplained how the light can act upon a _retina_ of this description\r\nthrough an opaque varnish. Below this multitude of threads (for such\r\nthe bodies appear), perpendicular to the _cornea_, is a _membrane_\r\nwhich serves them all for a base, and which consequently is nearly\r\nparallel with that part. It is very thin, of a black colour, not\r\nproduced by a varnish; and in it may be seen very fine white\r\n_tracheæ_, which send forth branches still finer, that penetrate\r\nbetween the prisms of the _cornea_: this membrane may be called\r\nthe _choroid_. Behind this is a thin expansion of the optic nerve,\r\nwhich is a true nervous membrane, precisely similar to the _retina_\r\nof red-blooded animals. It appears that the white pyramidal threads\r\nwhich form the _retina_ of each lens are sent forth by this general\r\n_retina_, and pierce the choroid by a number of almost imperceptible\r\nholes[1475]. From this description it appears that the eyes of\r\ninsects have nothing corresponding with the _uvea_ or _humours_ of\r\nthose of vertebrate animals, but are of a type peculiar to themselves.\r\n\r\nHaving explained to you the wonderful and complex structure with\r\nwhich it has pleased the CREATOR to distinguish the organs of vision\r\nof these minute beings, proving, what I have so often asserted,\r\nthat when animals seem approaching to nonentity, where one would\r\nexpect them to be most _simple_, we find them in many cases most\r\n_complex_, I shall now call your attention to the next thing I am\r\nto consider--the _number_ of the eyes in question. Most insects\r\nhave only _two_; but there are several exceptions to this rule.\r\nThose that have occasion to see both above and below the head,\r\nthe eyes of all being immovable, must have them so placed as to\r\nenable them to do this. This end is accomplished in many beetles,\r\nfor instance _Scarabæus_ L., _Helæus_ Latr., &c., by having these\r\norgans fixed in the _side_ of the head, so that part looks upward\r\nand part downward; but in others _four_ are given for this purpose.\r\nIf you examine the common whirlwig (_Gyrinus Natator_) that I have\r\nso often mentioned[1476], which has occasion, at the same time,\r\nto observe objects in the air and in the water, you will find it\r\nis gifted with this number of eyes. _Lamia Tornator_ (_Cerambyx\r\ntetrophthalmus_ Forst.) and some others, of which I make a genus,\r\nunder the appellation of _Tetrops_, are also so distinguished. In\r\nthese insects, one eye is above and the other below the base of\r\nthe antennæ; in fact, in these the _canthus_, instead of dividing\r\nthe eye partially, as in the other Capricorn-beetles, runs quite\r\nthrough it at considerable width[1477]. In _Ryssonotus_ MacLeay\r\n(_Lucanus nebulosus_ K.) the eye appears also to be divided in two\r\nby the _canthus_. In the _Neuroptera_ Order there is more than one\r\ninstance of the same kind. In _Ascalaphus_ there are two considerable\r\neyes on each side of the head, which, though clearly distinct, meet\r\nlike those of many male flies and the drone. The male, likewise,\r\nof more than one species of _Ephemera_, besides the common lateral\r\neyes and the _stemmata_ on the back of the head, have a pair of\r\ncompound eyes on the top of a short columnar process[1478]. In the\r\n_Hemiptera_ Order, also, an instance occurs of four eyes in the\r\ngenus _Aleyrodes_[1479]. Amongst the vertebrate animals, there\r\nis an example of eyes with two pupils in _Anableps_, a genus of\r\nfishes[1480], but no vertebrate animal has _four_ of these organs.\r\nThat many insects should have more than _two_ eyes, will not seem\r\nto you so extraordinary as that any should be found that, like the\r\nCyclops of old, have only _one_. There is, however, an insect,\r\nbefore celebrated for its agility[1481] (_Machilis polypoda_ Latr.),\r\nwhich has a single eye in its forehead; or we may say, its eyes\r\nare confluent, without any line of distinction between them except\r\na small notch behind. Now that I am treating of the _number_ of\r\neyes, I must not forget to observe to you, that in some insects no\r\neyes at all have been discovered. In _Polydesmus complanatus_, on\r\neach side of the head there is an eye-shaped portion separated by a\r\nsuture, in which under a powerful lens I cannot satisfy myself that\r\nI can discern any thing like the facets that usually distinguish\r\ncompound eyes. In _Geophilus electricus_, another myriapod, they\r\ncertainly do not exist[1482]. Whence we may conclude, as was before\r\nobserved[1483], that the faculty of emitting light is rather given it\r\nas a means of defence than to guide it in its path.\r\n\r\nThe _situation_ of compound eyes differs in different tribes. In\r\nsome, as in the _Staphylinidæ_, they are planted laterally in the\r\n_anterior_ part of the head; in others, the _Carabi_ &c., in the\r\n_middle_; in others again, _Locusta_ Leach &c., in the _posterior_\r\npart. In some, their station is more in the upper surface, either\r\nbefore or behind; so that a very narrow space separates them, or\r\nperhaps none at all. Instances of this position of the eyes occur\r\nin a minute weevil (_Ramphus_ Clairv.[1484]), and many _Diptera_,\r\n&c. Of those that form an union on the top of the head, some are\r\nplaced obliquely, so as to leave a diverging space below them,\r\nas in many _Libellulina_[1485], the drone[1486], &c. Others, as\r\n_Atractocerus_, in which the eyes occupy nearly the whole head,\r\nand unite anteriorly, have this diverging space _above_ their\r\nconflux. In _Rhina barbirostris_ Latr., another kind of weevil,\r\nthey are confluent _below_ the head, at the base of the rostrum,\r\nand a very narrow interval separates them above. In a large number\r\nof the _Heteromerous_ beetles, they are set _transversely_, in the\r\n_Capricorn_ ones _longitudinally_. Their surface, when they are\r\nlateral, has usually two aspects, one _prone_ to see below, the other\r\n_supine_ to see above. In general the eyes are situated behind the\r\nantennæ, so that their position, whether it shall be anterior or\r\nposterior, depends upon that of those organs. Often, indeed, as in\r\nthe last-named beetles, part of the eye is behind and part before the\r\nantennæ; but except where there are _four_ eyes, as in _Tetrops_,\r\nthey are never placed before or below them.\r\n\r\nThough the eyes of insects are generally _sessile_, yet to give them\r\na wider range they are sometimes, but it rarely occurs, placed, like\r\nthose of many _Crustacea_, on a _footstalk_, but not a _moveable_\r\none. An instance of this in certain male _Ephemeræ_ has already been\r\nmentioned. In the _Hemiptera_ De Geer has figured two species of bugs\r\n(_Cimicidæ_) that are so circumstanced[1487]; as are also all the known\r\n_Strepsiptera_ K., though in these the footstalk is very short[1488]:\r\nbut the most remarkable example of columnar eyes is afforded by that\r\ncurious _Dipterous_ genus _Diopsis_, in which both eyes and antennæ\r\nstand upon a pair of branches, vastly longer than the head, which\r\ndiverge at a very obtuse angle from its posterior part[1489].\r\n\r\nIn their _figure_ eyes vary much. Sometimes they are so prominent as\r\nto be nearly _spherical_: this is the case with some aquatic bugs,\r\nas _Ranatra_, _Hydrometra_, and several male _Ephemeræ_[1490]. Very\r\noften they are _hemispherical_, as in the tiger-beetles (_Cicindela_\r\nL.), and the clocks or dors (_Carabus_ L.); but in a large number\r\nof insects they are flat, and do not rise above the surface of the\r\nhead.--With regard to their _outline_, they are often perfectly\r\n_round_, as in many weevils; _oval_, as in various bees; _ovate_, as\r\nin other bees (_Andrena_ F.); _triangular_, as in the water-boatman\r\n(_Notonecta_). They are also often _oblong_, and occasionally narrow\r\nand _linear_; as in that singular beetle _Helæus_. In many of the\r\n_Muscidæ_ they form nearly a _semicircle_, or rather, perhaps, the\r\nquadrant of a sphere. The eyes of the Capricorn-beetles (_Cerambyx_\r\nL.) have a sinus on their inner side, as it were, taken out of them;\r\nso that they more than half surround the antennæ, before which is the\r\nlongest portion of them. An approach to this shape is more or less\r\nobserved in the darkling-beetles (_Tenebrio_ L.); but in these the\r\nsinus is not so deep. I may under this head observe, that in those\r\n_Mantidæ_ that represent dry leaves, and some others, these organs\r\nusually terminate in a spine[1491].\r\n\r\nThough not distinguished by the beauty and animation that give such\r\ninterest to the eye of vertebrate animals, and exhibiting no trace of\r\niris or pupil, yet from the variety of their _colours_ the compound\r\neyes of insects, though most commonly black or brown, are often very\r\nstriking. Look at those of one of the lace-winged flies that commit\r\nsuch havoc amongst the _Aphides_[1492], and it will dazzle you with\r\nthe splendour of the purest gold, sometimes softened with a lovely\r\ngreen. The lenses of those of _Xenos_ blaze like diamonds set in\r\njet[1493]. You have often noticed the fiery eyes of many horse-flies\r\n(_Tabanus_ L.) with vivid bands of purple and green[1494]. Others\r\nare spotted[1495]; and Schellenberg has figured one (_Thereva\r\nhemiptera_)[1496], that exhibits the figure of a flower painted in\r\nred on a black ground. These colours and markings are all most vivid\r\nand brilliant in the _living_ insect, and often impart that fire\r\nand animation to the eyes for which those of the higher animals are\r\nremarkable. Take one of the large dragon-flies that you see hawking\r\nabout the hedges in search of prey, examine its eyes under a lens, and\r\nyou will be astonished at the brilliance and crystalline transparency\r\nwhich its large eyes exhibit, and by the remarkable vision of larger\r\nhexagons which appear in motion under the _cornea_, being reflected by\r\nthe _retina_--all which give it the appearance of a living eye. This\r\nmoving reflexion of the hexagonal lenses in living insects was noticed\r\nlong since in some bees (_Nomada_ F., _Cœlioxys_ Latr.)[1497]\r\n\r\nCompound eyes differ greatly in their _size_. In some insects,\r\nas _Atractocerus_, the drone-bee, many male _Muscidæ_, &c., they\r\noccupy nearly the whole of the head; while in others, as numerous\r\n_Staphylinidæ_, _Locusta_ Leach, &c., they are so small as to be\r\nscarcely larger than some simple eyes of spiders: and they exhibit\r\nevery intermediate difference of magnitude in different tribes,\r\ngenera, and species.\r\n\r\nUnder this head I must say something of the _Canthus_ of the eye;\r\nby which I mean an elevated process of the cheek, which in almost\r\nall the genera of the Lamellicorn beetles enters the eye more or\r\nless, dividing the upper portion from the lower. Though usually\r\nonly a _process_ of the cheek, yet in the _Scarabæidæ_ the whole\r\nof that part forms the _canthus_[1498]. It only _enters_ the eye\r\nin the _Rutelidæ_, _Cetonidæ_, &c.; it extends through _half_ of\r\nit in _Copris_; it goes _beyond_ the half in _Ateuchus_; and in\r\n_Ryssonotus_ MacLeay (_Lucanus nebulosus_ K.) it quite divides the\r\neye into two[1499], as I before observed. In _Lucanus_, _Passalus_\r\n&c. it projects before the eye into an angle; in _Lucanus femoralis_\r\nnearly into a spine; but in _Lamprima_ and _Œsalus_ it does not\r\nexist. The part, also, that enters the eye in the Capricorn-beetles\r\nmay be regarded as a kind of _canthus_, though it is merely a\r\ndilatation of the _front_.\r\n\r\n4. _Stemmata_[1500].--Having given so full an account of the kinds\r\nand structure of the ordinary eyes of insects, you may perhaps expect\r\nthat I should now dismiss the subject: you would, however, have great\r\ncause to blame me, did I not make you acquainted with a kind of\r\nauxiliary eyes with which a large portion of them are gifted; I mean\r\nthose pellucid spots often to be found on the posterior part of the\r\nfront of these animals, or upon the vertex, frequently arranged in a\r\ntriangle. These, Linné, from his regarding them as a kind of coronet,\r\ncalled _Stemmata_. They have been of late denominated _Ocelli_; but as\r\nthis latter term is also in general use for the eyelets on the wings\r\nof _Lepidoptera_, I have adhered to that of the illustrious Swede.\r\nNeither he nor Fabricius has expressed any opinion as to the _use_ of\r\nthese organs; but Swammerdam and Reaumur were aware that they were\r\nreal _eyes_. The former found that there are nerves that diverge to\r\nthem though not easily traced, and that they have a _cornea_, and\r\nwhat he takes for the _uvea_[1501]; and the latter has supposed that\r\nthe compound eyes and these simple ones have, the one the power of\r\nmagnifying objects much, and the other but little, so that the former\r\nare for surveying those that are distant, and the latter those that\r\nare near[1502]. The same author relates some experiments that he tried\r\nwith the common hive bee, by which he ascertained that the _stemmata_,\r\nas well as the compound eyes, were organs of vision. He first smeared\r\nthe _latter_ over with paint, and the animals, instead of making for\r\ntheir hive, rose in the air till he lost sight of them. He next did the\r\nsame with the _former_, and placing the bees whose _stemmata_ he had\r\npainted within a few paces of their hive, they flew about on all sides\r\namong the neighbouring plants, but never far: he did not observe that\r\nthese ever rose in the air like the others[1503]. From this experiment\r\nit seems as if the compound eyes were for _horizontal_ sight, and the\r\n_stemmata_ for _vertical_.\r\n\r\nThe definition of them by Linné and Fabricius as smooth, shining,\r\nelevated or hemispheric puncta, conveys a very inadequate idea of\r\nthem; for, except in a very few instances, they are perfectly clear\r\nand transparent, and their appearance is precisely the same as that\r\nof the simple eyes of _Arachnida_ &c., under which head they might\r\nvery well have been arranged; but as the last are _primary_ eyes, and\r\nthe stemmata _secondary_, it seemed to me best that they should stand\r\nby themselves. The structure of both is probably the same, and their\r\ninternal organization that of one of the lenses of a compound eye,\r\nand both are set in a socket of the head.\r\n\r\nThough a large number of insects have them, they are by no means\r\nuniversal, since some Orders, as the _Strepsiptera_, _Dermaptera_, and\r\n_Aptera_, are altogether without them. The _Coleoptera_, also, have\r\nbeen supposed to afford no instance of species furnished with them;\r\nbut in the last number of Germar and Zincken Sommer's _Magasin_, it is\r\naffirmed that they are discoverable in Gravenhorst's genus _Omalium_,\r\nbut not in the kindred genera _Micropeplus_ and _Anthophagus_[1504].\r\nUpon examining the former genus, I find, that although _Omalium\r\nplanum_ and affinities, _O. striatulum_, and some others, appear\r\nnot to have them, yet with the aid of a good magnifier they may be\r\ndiscovered in most species of that genus; as likewise in _Evœsthetus_\r\nGrav. I find them also very conspicuous in _A. Caraboides_ and other\r\n_Anthophagi_, but some species appear to want them. In these insects\r\nthey are two in number, situated in the vertex a little behind the\r\neyes but within them, and either at each end of a transverse furrow,\r\nor at the posterior termination of two longitudinal ones. Nor are they\r\nfound in all the genera of the other Orders. In the _Orthoptera_, the\r\n_Blattidæ_, unless a white smooth spot on the inner and upper side of\r\nthe eyes may be regarded as representing them, have them not; but in\r\nall the other genera of that Order they are to be found[1505]. In the\r\n_Hemiptera_ all the _Cicadiadæ_ are gifted with them; as are likewise\r\n_Tetyra_, _Pentatoma_, with many other _Cimicidæ_, and the _Reduviadæ_\r\nvery remarkably; but many others in both sections of this order, as\r\n_Thrips_, _Coccus_, _Aphis_, _Capsus_, _Miris_, _Naucoris_, _Nepa_, and\r\n_Notonecta_, &c. are deprived of them[1506]. Of the _Neuroptera_ the\r\n_Libellulina_ add _stemmata_ to their large eyes, in the anterior angle\r\nof which they are stationed[1507]; but many other genera of that Order\r\nare without them; as _Myrmeleon_, _Ascalaphus_, _Hemerobius_, &c. The\r\n_Trichoptera_ and _Lepidoptera_ universally have them; though in the\r\nlatter, except in _Castnia_ and the _Sphingidæ_, they are not easily\r\nseen. In the _Hymenoptera_ they are usually very conspicuous, but in\r\n_Larra_ and _Lyrops_, two genera of this order, the posterior pair are\r\nscarcely discernible; and in the neuter ants they are quite obsolete.\r\nIn the _Diptera_, though many genera are furnished with them, yet many\r\nalso want them; amongst the rest Latreille's _Tipulariæ_, and all the\r\nhorse-flies (_Tabanus_ L.). The _Pupiparæ_ (_Hippobosca_ L.) usually\r\nhave none; but in _Ornithomyia avicularia_, one of that tribe, though\r\nextremely minute they are visible, arranged in a triangle, in the\r\npolished space of their vertex.\r\n\r\nAs to the _Number_ of the _stemmata_, _three_ appears to be most\r\nuniversal. Reaumur mentions an instance in which he counted _four_ in\r\na fly with two threads at its tail; but great doubt rests upon this\r\nstatement[1508]. Some Orthopterous genera, as _Gryllotalpa_, and many\r\nHemipterous, as _Tetyra_, _Pentatoma_, _Reduvius_[1509], _Cercopis_,\r\n_Fulgora_[1510], &c., have no more than _two_; and in _Larra_ and its\r\naffinities, as just observed, the posterior ones are obsolete, so as\r\nto leave only _one_ discernible.\r\n\r\nWhere there are _three_ of these organs, they are usually arranged in\r\nan obverse _triangle_ in the space behind the antennæ, at a greater\r\nor less distance from them. In those male flies (_Muscidæ_) whose\r\neyes are confluent, the _stemmata_ are in a little area _behind_\r\ntheir conflux; but, as before observed, in the drone-bee and the\r\n_Libellulina_ they are _before_ it. This triangle is in some cases\r\nnearly _equilateral_, as in _Perla_ related to the may-flies, and\r\nmany _Hymenoptera_; in others it is _acutangular_, as in _Locusta_\r\n&c., in which the _stemma_ forming the vertex of the triangle is\r\nbefore the antenna[1511]: in others, again, it is _obtusangular_,\r\nas you will see in _Pepsis_ and various _Hymenoptera_. In the\r\nhumble-bees (_Bombus_), a line drawn through them would form a slight\r\ncurve. Their _situation_ also varies. In insects that have only\r\n_two_, they are sometimes placed a little _behind_ the eyes, or in\r\nthe back part of the space between them: this is the case with most\r\nof the bugs (_Cimex_ L.) that have them.--They are often _distant_,\r\nas in _Tetyra_ F., _Edessa_ F.; and sometimes _approximated_, as\r\nin _Reduvius_ F.[1512] In many of the Homopterous _Hemiptera_, as\r\n_Cercopis_, _Ledra_, &c. they are planted in the _upper_ part of\r\nthe head[1513], but in _Iassus_ their situation is on the _under_\r\npart; and in a North American subgenus, as yet without a name, they\r\nare exactly _between_ the two, being placed in the frontal angle.\r\nIn _Fulgora_ their station is between the eyes and antennæ[1514].\r\nThey are most commonly _sessile_, and as it were _set_ in the head;\r\nbut in some, as _Fulgora candelaria_, they stand on a _footstalk_.\r\nThe _stemmata_ are set in the side of a frontal tubercle in that\r\nfour-winged fly of threatening aspect, _Corydalis_, which in its\r\n_perfect state_ has mandibles, but longer and more tremendous,\r\nlike those that distinguish the _larva_ only of the kindred genus\r\n_Hemerobius_[1515]. These organs differ little in _shape_, being\r\nusually perfectly _round_ and somewhat _convex_; but occasionally\r\nthey vary in this respect. In _Fulgora serrata_ they are _oblong_,\r\nwith a longitudinal depression; in _F. Diadema_ they are also\r\numbilicated, but the _umbilicus_ is circular; in _Corydalis_ they are\r\n_oval_; in other insects they are _ovate_; in some _semicircular_,\r\nand in a few _triangular_. They vary much in _size_: in some of\r\nthese animals being so minute as to be scarcely visible, while in\r\nothers, as _Corydalis_, _Dorylus_, _Vespa pallida_ F., _Reduvius_,\r\n&c.[1515], they are as large as some compound eyes. They differ also\r\nin _colour_, though often _black_: in _Fulgora laternaria_ they\r\nare of a beautiful _yellow_; in F. _candelaria_ they are _white_;\r\nin many _Hymenoptera_ they are _crystalline_, in others _red_: the\r\nfierce look of _Reduvius personatus_ is rendered more hateful by its\r\n_stemmata_ having a pale iris round a dark pupil[1516].\r\n\r\nLet us here stop and adore the goodness of a beneficent CREATOR, who,\r\nthough he has deprived these little beings of the _moveable_ eyes\r\nwith which he has gifted the higher animals, has made it up to them\r\nby the variety and complex structure of their organs of vision, where\r\n_we_ have only _two_ points of sight, giving _them_ more than as many\r\n_myriads_.\r\n\r\n5. _Antennæ._--But of all the organs of insects, none appear to be\r\nof more importance to them than their _Antennæ_, and none certainly\r\nare more wonderful and more various in their structure, and probably\r\nuses. Upon this last particular I shall enlarge hereafter. Their\r\nstructure, as far as it differs in the sexes, I fully discussed in\r\na former letter[1517]; and the most remarkable kinds of them will\r\nbe included in a set of definitions which I shall draw up for you\r\nbefore our correspondence on this part of my subject closes: I shall\r\ntherefore now confine myself to the following particulars--namely,\r\ntheir _number_, _insertion_, _substance_, _situation_, _proportion_,\r\n_general form_ and _structure_, _clothing_, _expansion_, _motions_,\r\nand _station of repose_.\r\n\r\nAs to their _Number_, in the majority of _crustaceous_ animals the\r\nantennæ amount to _four_, but no _insect_ has more than _two_. A\r\ngenus recently established (_Otiocerus_ Kirby[1518]) seems to afford\r\nan exception to this rule, since the species composing it at first\r\nsight appear to have _four_, and in some instances even _six_ antennæ;\r\nbut as only _two_ of them terminate in a bristle, the other, though\r\nproceeding from the same bed of membrane, may perhaps be regarded\r\nas merely appendages. Germar, who has described a species of this\r\ngenus[1519] under the name of _Cobax Wintheri_, considers these\r\nappendages as analogous to _palpi_: but as they do not proceed from\r\nthe _oral_ organs, but from the bed of the _antennæ_ at the base of the\r\nnose[1520], they ought certainly to be regarded rather as accessories\r\nto the latter, than as representing the former. In the _Aptera_ order\r\nthe mites (_Acacus_ L.) appear to be without these organs. In the\r\npupiparous tribe _Hippobosca_ they seem about to disappear; and in\r\nthe _Arachnida_ &c., as has been more than once observed[1521], the\r\n_mandibulæ_ have been thought to represent, not indeed the antennæ of\r\n_insects_, but the _inner_ pair of those of the _Crustacea_.\r\n\r\nIn considering the _insertion_ of antennæ, by which I mean their\r\narticulation with the head, we must advert first to the orifice\r\n(_Torulus_) that receives them[1522]. This is a perforation of the\r\ncrust of the head; commonly, though not invariably, circular: in\r\nColeopterous insects often with concave lubricous sides, forming\r\nan acetabulum, with processes usual in ginglymous articulations,\r\nlarger than the bulb or root of the antennæ; and which is commonly\r\ncovered, except the central space occupied by the bulb, with a\r\ntense membrane. Though not in general remarkable, in some cases\r\nit merits attention. In the genus _Rhipicera_ Latr., the elegant\r\nantennæ of whose males I have described in a former letter[1523],\r\nparticularly the Brazilian species, it is a long process on each side\r\nof the nose, and might be mistaken for the first joint: in another\r\nColeopterous genus, _Priocera_ K.[1524], it has somewhat of the\r\nshape of a trumpet: in _Cupes_ a tubercle rises just above the base\r\nof the antenna: a circular process forms the torulus in _Fulgora_\r\nand others. It is also often placed in a cavity of the front, as in\r\nseveral wild-bees, _Melitta_ K., and in _Locusta_ Leach on the sides\r\nof an elevation of that part[1525]. In a large majority of insects\r\nthe bulb (_Bulbus_) or ball which is received by the bed, wears the\r\nappearance, especially in the _Hymenoptera_, of a distinct joint; but\r\nif you carefully examine it, you will clearly see that it is merely\r\nthe base of the _scape_ swelled out into a spherical or other kindred\r\nform[1526]; and often marked, as in the _Cicindelidæ_, with impressed\r\npoints: as it is the piece by which the antenna moves in its socket,\r\nthis form of a _rotula_ was doubtless given for its more ready motion\r\nin all directions. This structure is principally conspicuous in the\r\n_Coleoptera_ and _Hymenoptera_ Orders: in the others the base is not\r\nso distinguished from the rest of the scape. If you carefully extract\r\nthe antennæ of a beetle, say a _Copris_ or _Lamia_, and examine its\r\nbase or bottom, you will find that it is open for the transmission\r\nof muscles and nerves; that in its upper margin it has a deep notch\r\nor sinus, on each side of which is a smaller notch; and that all\r\nround the margin, which is very lubricous, a membranous ligament is\r\nattached, by which it was affixed in the torulus. Its articulation,\r\ntherefore, seems of a mixed kind, like that of most other organs and\r\nparts of insects, partaking of the ligamentous, ginglymous, and ball\r\nand socket. In the _Orthoptera_, _Hemiptera_, &c. the articulation\r\nseems more purely ligamentous.\r\n\r\nWith regard to their _substance_--these organs are regulated, in some\r\ndegree, by the nature of the integument of the animal of which they\r\nare appendages; in the softer insects being of a softer substance than\r\nthey are in hard ones. The vertex of the joints, where they receive the\r\nsucceeding one, appears in many cases to be softer than the rest of\r\nit, and especially towards the apex, often papillose. The antennæ are\r\ngenerally opaque; but in _Nebria complanata_, a beetle common on the\r\nsea-coast in Wales and Lincolnshire, they are semitransparent.\r\n\r\nThe _situation_ of antennæ must next be considered. In this respect\r\nit seems necessary that they should be so situated as to be under\r\nthe direction of the eyes: for if you examine ten thousand insects\r\n(except, as was before observed[1527], where there are _four_ eyes),\r\nyou will not find one in which these organs are situated either above\r\nor immediately behind them; their station being always either somewhere\r\nin the space between the eyes or that below them. In _Ptinus_ F. they\r\nare placed near the vertex; but in _Gibbium_, which is so nearly\r\nrelated to that destructive genus[1528], they are beneath them. In many\r\n_Melittæ_ K. they are in the middle of the space between the eyes; and\r\nin many other _Hymenoptera_ and _Coleoptera_ (_Staphylinus_ &c.), in\r\nthe anterior part of it. In many Lamellicorn genera (except in some\r\n_Acridæ_, as _A. viridissima_) as _Melolontha_, _Cetonia_, _Lucanus_,\r\n&c. they may be regarded as planted in the lower surface of the cheek\r\nbefore the eyes; but in _Copris_ &c., in which they are inserted\r\nfurther under the shield of the head, they are properly in the _prone_\r\nsurface of the _front_. In the Capricorn-beetles (_Cerambyx_ L.) and\r\n_Cnodalon_ F. they may be termed _inocular_, or placed in a sinus of\r\nthe eye; in the former tribe in its _interior_, and in the latter its\r\n_anterior_ side. In the Rhynchophorous or rostrum-bearing beetles\r\n(_Curculio_ L.) they vary in their situation. Thus in _Macrocephalus_\r\nOliv. they are inserted at its apex; in _Anthribus_ in its middle,\r\nand in _Calandra_ at its base[1529]. In the water-scorpions (_Nepa_,\r\n_Belostoma_, &c.) they may be called _extraocular_, being placed\r\nunder the head in its prone part, outside the eyes[1530]. In _Nirmus\r\nFringillæ_, a kind of bird-louse, they appear to be _oral_, being\r\nsituated, according to De Geer, under the head near the mouth, at a\r\ngreat distance from the eyes[1531].\r\n\r\nIn their _proportions_, both as to length and thickness, antennæ vary\r\nextremely. Thus sometimes they are very short--much shorter than\r\nthe head; as in the aquatic beetles _Gyrinus_, _Parnus_, and the\r\nwater-scorpion; and some land-beetles, as _Anthrenus_, &c. At other\r\ntimes they far exceed the length of the insect: the males of many\r\nCapricorn-beetles are so distinguished. In that of _Lamia ædilis_\r\nthey are more than _four_ times as long as the body; and every\r\nintermediate length between these two may be found amongst them.\r\nThey vary also greatly in _thickness_: in _Paussus_, whose antennæ\r\nemit light in the night[1532], and _Cerapterus_, they are nearly as\r\nthick,--at least their knob, which forms the chief part of them,--as\r\nthe body of the insect[1533]; while in _Mantis_, _Acrida_ K. and\r\n_Psocus_, they are as slender as a hair. The antennæ in many of the\r\n_Prioni_, especially in _P. imbricornis_, are thick from base to tip;\r\nwhile in other Capricorn-beetles they are quite the reverse.\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary to enlarge here upon the general _form_\r\nof these organs: I shall therefore only notice the two principal\r\ndivisions of them in this respect.--Antennæ, regard being had to\r\none of their uses, may be divided into two sections, distinguished\r\nby forms extremely different: those, namely, that are employed by\r\ninsects as _tactors_ to explore their way, and those that cannot be so\r\nemployed. The great majority are of the former kind; but those that\r\nmay be denominated _setigerous_,--as the antennæ of the _Libellulina_,\r\n_Ephemerina_, of the Homopterous _Hemiptera_, and of many _Diptera_,\r\nthe last joint of which terminates in a bristle, or is furnished\r\nwith a lateral one, and of some gnats that have short feathered\r\nantennæ,--appear not fitted to be used as tactors to explore by touch,\r\nand form the latter description. This difference in these organs, as\r\nI shall have occasion to prove more at large hereafter, furnishes a\r\nstrong presumption that their _primary_ function is not _touch_. Were\r\nthis the case, it would be common to them all.\r\n\r\nAs to their _structure_, antennæ consist in general of a number\r\nof tubular joints; each of which having separate motion, the\r\nanimal is thereby enabled to give them every flexure necessary for\r\nits purposes. The _scape_, or first joint, by means of the bulb\r\ninosculates in the _torulus_, or is suspended to it; and the others,\r\nsometimes by a similar, though less pronounced knob at their base,\r\ninosculate in the preceding one; but in some cases the inosculation\r\nseems not so perfect, the joints being simply suspended by ligament.\r\nIn pectinated or lamellated antennæ, the branch is usually a lateral\r\nprocess of the joint from which it issues; but in _Phengodes_\r\n(_Lampyris plumosa_ L.) its involute plumose branches appear to\r\narticulate with the apex of each joint[1534]. I have a specimen of\r\none of the _Cleridæ_, of a genus undescribed, in which each branch\r\nis forked. In some tribes of the Capricorn-beetles (_Stenocorus_,\r\n&c.) the antennæ are often armed at their apex with spines, sometimes\r\non the upper side and sometimes below. In some aquatic beetles\r\n(_Gyrinus_, _Parnus_) they are furnished with an auricle at their\r\nbase, which, like the lid of a box, shuts them in when unemployed,\r\nand protects them from the water[1535].\r\n\r\nThe portions into which antennæ may in general be considered as\r\ndivided, have been sufficiently explained to you above; but it may\r\nnot be amiss to add here a few words on the principal variations in\r\ntheir structure that I have had an opportunity of observing. The\r\n_scapus_[1536] or first joint, which includes the _bulbus_, is usually\r\nthe most conspicuous joint in the antenna (exclusive, I mean, of the\r\n_capitulum_, in those in which that organ terminates in a knob),\r\nit being thicker and often longer than the succeeding ones. In the\r\nCapricorn and Darkling beetles, indeed (_Cerambyx_ and _Tenebrio_ L.),\r\nthe third joint is the longest, but the scape is still the thickest;\r\nand in the stag-beetles (_Lucanus_ L.), many of the weevil tribes\r\n(_Curculio_ L.), and those of the bees (_Apis_ L.), except in the\r\nmales, it is as long nearly as the remainder of the antennæ, which\r\nforms an angle with it. In shape it is generally somewhat curved and\r\nsubclavate, or increasing in size from the base to the summit; but\r\nit is sometimes straight and filiform, at others oblong or square,\r\nat others again triangular, in several instances three-sided: in one\r\n(_Cetonia cruenta_ F. _Genuchus_ K.) it is, as it were, broken, the\r\nupper part forming nearly a right angle with the lower; in _Cerocoma\r\nSchæfferi_ it is foliaceous; and it is occasionally suborbicular: and\r\nprobably many other forms might be enumerated.\r\n\r\nThe _Pedicellus_[1537] is the _second_, and may be deemed the _least\r\nconspicuous_ joint of the antennæ. Though more slender than the scape,\r\nit is generally thicker than that which immediately follows it. In\r\nbroken antennæ it is the hinge or pivot on which the _clavola_ or upper\r\nmember turns: it is usually very short, campanulate or bell-shaped, or\r\nobconical; but in a species of bug (_Tetyra_, from New Holland--_T.\r\npedicellata_ Kirb. MS.) it is nearly as long as all the rest of\r\nthe joints taken together. In those species of _Lycus_, a genus of\r\nbeetles related to the glow-worm, that have flattened antennæ (as _L.\r\nreticulatus_, _fasciatus_, &c.), this joint is almost received into the\r\nsocket of the scape, so that their antennæ appear at first to have only\r\n_ten_ joints, but in those which have those organs filiform (as _L.\r\nminutus_, _Aurora_, &c.) it is more conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe _Clavola_[1538], or remaining joints of the antennæ taken\r\ntogether, constitutes the principal part of the organ, which,\r\nespecially at its extremity, exercises its functions of touch, or\r\nany other sense. The principal variations, as to form and structure,\r\nthat occur in this part will be mentioned in another place. I shall\r\nonly here observe, that in many instances the first joint of this\r\npart is longer than the rest; but in _Tetyra pedicellata_ just\r\nmentioned, it is by far the shortest, and shaped like the pedicel\r\nof most insects. In the _Libellulina_, the Homopterous _Hemiptera_,\r\nand those flies whose antennæ terminate in a bristle, the clavolet\r\nis represented by the bristle. But in the flies which have a lateral\r\nbristle, on the last joint, and those with triarticulate antennæ that\r\nhave no bristle, the terminal joint represents it. The clavolet often\r\nterminates in a knob, or in several joints thicker than that which\r\nprecedes them. This varies greatly, not only in its form, but also\r\nin the number of joints of which it is composed. Thus in _Paussus_,\r\n_Platypus_, and many _Calandræ_, it consists of only a _single_\r\njoint[1539]; in _Anthrenus_, _Ditoma_, &c. of _two_; in _Nitidula_,\r\n_Geotrupes_, &c. of _three_[1540]; in _Tetratoma_, the _Silphidæ_,\r\nof _four_[1541]; of _five_ in _Scaphidium_[1542]; of _six_ in\r\none species of _Languria_, of _seven_ in the common cockchafer\r\n(_Melolontha vulgaris_[1543]); of _eight_ in _Diaperis Boleti_, in\r\nwhich the whole clavolet forms the club[1544]; of _nine_ in _Oenas_;\r\nand _ten_ in _Cerapterus_[1545]. All the above, you will observe,\r\nare _beetles_. In the other orders there are _eleven_ joints in the\r\nknob of some butterflies; _twelve_ in that of _Ascalaphus_[1546] and\r\n_Myrmeleon_; and lastly, _fourteen_ in _Trachelus_[1547].\r\n\r\nUnder _structure_ also, the _number_ of joints of which antennæ in\r\ngeneral consist, should be considered. If you examine the insects\r\nbelonging to the different orders, you will find remarkable variations\r\nin this respect. Let us run through them:--In the _Coleoptera_ the\r\nnatural number of joints is _eleven_; but this rule is not without\r\nmany exceptions. Thus, many have _fewer_ than the prescribed number:\r\n_Paussus_ has only _two_[1548], _Claviger_ and _Platypus_ five,\r\n_Dorcatoma_ and _Calandra_ eight[1549], _Geniates_ K. and _Phanæus_\r\nMacLeay nine[1550], and lastly _Melolontha ten_[1551]. Others, again,\r\nhave _more_ than eleven joints: _Cebrio grandis_, _Chrysomela stolida_,\r\nsome _Saperdæ_, and several others, have _twelve_. In _Prionus\r\nimbricornis_ the female has _nineteen_, and the male _twenty_[1552].\r\n_Rhipicera marginata_ has _thirty-two_; and in a New Holland species\r\nof this genus I counted _thirty-eight_. In the _Orthoptera_ I can\r\ntrace no general law in this respect. In _Locusta_ Leach in some\r\nspecies you may count _fourteen_ joints, in others _sixteen_, and in\r\nothers _twenty-five_. In one, which appears to be a pupa, I found\r\nonly _thirteen_. In _Mantis_ they exceed _thirty_; but in _Blatta_,\r\nfrom between _thirty_ and _forty_, they reach nearly _one hundred\r\nand fifty_; often varying in number in different individuals of the\r\nsame species. The order _Hemiptera_ exhibits two peculiar types of\r\nantennæ, which, with some exceptions, distinguish the two natural\r\nsections into which M. Latreille has judiciously divided it. In the\r\n_Heteropterous_ section they are _without_ a bristle at their end; and\r\nin the _Homopterous_ one, with the exception of _Aphis_, _Thrips_,\r\n&c. they _have_ one. In the genera of both these tribes, the number\r\nof joints varies in these organs. Thus, exclusive of the seta, in\r\n_Flata_ and _Cixius_ there are only _two_ joints; in _Galgulus_,\r\n_Fulgora_, and _Cercopis_, there are _three_; in _Lygæus_, _Coreus_,\r\n&c. there are _four_; in _Tetyra_, _Pentatoma_, _Tettigonia_, there\r\nare _five_[1554]; in _Aleyrodes_ there are _six_; in _Aphis seven_; in\r\n_Thrips eight_; in _Psylla ten_, the last of which is terminated by\r\ntwo bristles[1555]; and in _Coccus eleven_. The _Neuroptera_ order,\r\nas it stands at present, is regulated by no general rule with regard\r\nto the number of joints in the antennæ of the insects that compose\r\nit. Several types of form in these organs distinguish its discordant\r\ntribes. The _first_ is that of the _Ephemeræ_, in which the antennæ\r\nconsist of two short joints, crowned by a short, tapering, _unjointed_\r\nbristle. The _second_ is that of the _Libellulina_, similar to the\r\nabove, but with a _jointed_ bristle. The _third_ is that of _Psocus_,\r\nin which the antenna has two short thick joints at the base, terminated\r\nby a long filiform bristle, consisting of seven or eight joints, and\r\nfiner than a hair. Perhaps these three may be regarded as belonging to\r\na common type. The _fourth_ type is presented by the short filiform\r\nantennæ of _Termes_; the _fifth_ by the setaceous ones of _Corydalis_,\r\n_Hemerobius_, &c.; and the _sixth_ and last by the clavate and\r\ncapitate ones of _Myrmeleon_ and _Ascalaphus_. In the _Lepidoptera_\r\nand _Trichoptera_ orders the antennæ, though varying in their general\r\nform in the three tribes of which Linné formed his genera _Papilio_,\r\n_Sphinx_, and _Phalæna_, with the exception of _Hepialus_, in which\r\nthe joints are few, are always _multiarticulate_:--we will therefore,\r\nwithout further delay, proceed to the _Hymenoptera_. In Latreille's\r\ntribe _Aculeata_ the general rule is, that the females shall have\r\n_twelve_ joints and the males _thirteen_. In his _Ichneumonides_\r\nthe law seems to be, that the antennæ shall be multiarticulate\r\nand setaceous; but in most of the other tribes of the order, even\r\nthose that in other respects are most nearly related,--as in his\r\n_Tenthredinetæ_,--the number of joints of these organs varies without\r\nend. Thus in _Hylotoma_ there are only _three_ joints[1556]; in _Cimbex\r\nlæta_[1557] _five_; in _C. axillaris_ and _Perga_ Leach[1558], six:\r\nand so on to twenty-five or more[1559]. The same fluctuation in this\r\nrespect runs throughout the rest of the order. In the _Diptera_ there\r\nare two general types of antennæ:--those of the _Tipulariæ_ Latr.,\r\nconsisting usually of from _fourteen_ to _sixteen_ joints, in the\r\nmales often resembling beautiful plumes; and those of the remainder of\r\nthe order, in which they do not exceed _three_ joints[1560]: though\r\nthe last, or _patella_, is often further divided into obsolete or\r\nindistinct ones[1561]. These antennæ may be further subdivided into\r\n_filatæ_ and _aristatæ_, or those without and those with a bristle,\r\neither lateral or terminal.\r\n\r\nThe _clothing_ of antennæ also merits attention, since it is often\r\nnot a little remarkable. By clothing I understand the _down_ or\r\n_hairs_ of every kind with which they are either generally or\r\npartially covered. A great number of filiform and setaceous antennæ\r\nof Predaceous beetles (_Cicindela_ L., _Carabus_ L.) have the first\r\ntwo, three, or four joints naked, and the rest covered with a fine\r\ndown. In insects that have a knob at the end of these organs, whether\r\nlamellated or perfoliate, this down is often confined to it, or to its\r\nintermediate joints, and seems intermixed with nervous papillæ. These\r\nare particularly visible in the flabellate antennæ of _Rhipicera_,\r\n_Lampyris Latreillii_[1562], _Elater flabellicornis_[1563], &c.\r\ncovering both surfaces of the processes of the joints. In some male\r\nbees these papillæ are inclosed in hexagonal spaces into which the\r\nantennæ are marked out[1564]. It is to be observed, that in many\r\nantennæ the joints of the clavolet have one or two bristles or more\r\nat their apex, one above perhaps, and one below; the lower angle in\r\nthose of the serrated antennæ of _Elater_ is usually so furnished, and\r\nsometimes the upper. In many Capricorn-beetles and various insects the\r\nantennæ are clothed, instead of down, with stiffish hairs or short\r\nbristles. Other insects have these organs, at least the clavolet,\r\nbeset with longer hairs standing out from them on all sides: of this\r\nkind are those of a singular beetle (_Sarrotrium muticum_) sometimes\r\nfound in this country[1565]. Again, there are some that have only\r\ntheir underside bearded with longer hairs; as _Lamia curculionoides_,\r\n_speculifera_ K., and other Capricorns[1566]. In another of this tribe,\r\n_Saperda hirsuticornis_, the three intermediate joints are ornamented\r\nwith branches of long black hairs, which give them an elegant and\r\nfeathery appearance[1567]. In _Callichroma alpina_ the apex of the\r\nslate-coloured joints of its antennæ is bearded with black hairs. In\r\n_Lamia reticulata_, and _Saperda fasciculata_ and _plumigera_, all\r\nalso Capricorns, a single bunch of hairs, resembling the brush of a\r\nbottle-cleaner, signalizes the middle of the antenna[1568]: in _Saperda\r\nscopulicornis_ K. this is star-shaped[1569]. Sometimes the _scape_ is\r\nexternally bearded, as in _Trox_, a beetle found in horns and bones;\r\nand in many other Lamellicorns[1570]. In this last tribe the two\r\nexterior leaves of the knob of the antennæ are often set with short\r\nbristles[1571]; and in a minute beetle called by De Geer _Dermestes\r\natomarius_, the hairs of this part are said to form a brush[1572].\r\n\r\nWhen insects, I mean more particularly _Coleoptera_, are about to\r\nmove from any station where they have been at rest, the first thing\r\nthey usually do, before they set a step, is to bring forward and\r\n_expand_ their antennæ, which have either been carefully laid up\r\nin a cavity fitted to receive them, or back upon the body: if they\r\nterminate in a lamellated knob, they separate the lamellæ as far as\r\npossible from each other; or if it is perfoliate, the joints of it\r\nmutually recede. The object of this is evidently to collect notices\r\nfrom the atmosphere, since the papillose part of these joints cannot\r\nbe applied to surfaces. When the animal begins to move, in many cases\r\nthe antennæ do the same, and continue their _motion_ till it stops\r\nand returns to a state of repose. In the parasitic tribes of the\r\n_Hymenoptera_ (_Ichneumon_ L.) they are kept in an almost constant\r\nvibration. Many other insects move them in all directions without\r\nany order or regularity; and others, when they elevate one depress\r\nthe other, and so proceed as if balancing themselves by means of\r\nthese organs like a rope-dancer. I have before stated to you how by\r\nmotions of their antennæ, ants and bees communicate their wants or\r\ndiscoveries to each other, or make inquiry concerning any thing they\r\nwish to know[1573]. But as I shall have occasion to make some further\r\nremarks upon this subject, when the senses of insects are under\r\ndiscussion, I shall for the present take my leave of it.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude what I have to communicate to you relative to\r\nthe organs of which we are treating, with a few observations with\r\nrespect to their _station_ when the insect _reposes_. In the\r\nCapricorn-beetles, _Eucera_ and other insects with _long_ antennæ,\r\nthey are merely turned back or on one side with no particular cavity\r\nfor their reception when unemployed, but probably the apex passes\r\nunder the body. In the Predaceous and Darkling beetles (_Carabus_\r\nL., _Tenebrio_ L.) their station is usually under the sides of\r\nthe _prothorax_, and in the Tortoise beetles (_Cassida_), under\r\nits anterior margin. In the Elastic beetles (_Elater_) they are\r\nreceived into a groove between the under margin of that part and\r\nthe fore-breast (_antepectus_). In _Anthrenus_, when the animal\r\nreposes or counterfeits death, the antennæ are concealed in a cavity\r\nof the underside of the _prothorax_, at right angles with the\r\nthroat[1574]. In the kindred genus _Byrrhus_, another simulator of\r\ndeath, a large cavity is excavated under the same part, to receive\r\nboth the forelegs and antennæ, a narrow space being left between\r\nthe angle of the _prothorax_ and fore-breast exactly admitting the\r\nbase of the latter, which are quite concealed under the former. In\r\n_Cryptocephalus_ and _Chlamys_, kindred beetles, when at rest they\r\nare withdrawn, except their scape and pedicel, with the head within\r\nthe cavity of the _prothorax_. In others they are turned under the\r\nhead, without any particular cavity for their reception; as in\r\nmany moths, _Apion_, &c. In most of the Lamellicorn beetles their\r\nstation is in the cavity formed by the eye and the throat, the knob\r\nforming an angle with the rest of the antenna. In _Heterocerus_\r\nthey follow the contour of the eye[1575]. In _Brentus_, a genus\r\nof weevils remarkably long and slender, they are turned back and\r\nreceived by a slight longitudinal cavity of the rostrum; but in those\r\nof this tribe (_Curculio_ L.) in which the clavolet forms an angle\r\nwith the long scape, this latter part, bending back, is laid up in\r\nan oblique channel of that part; and the former, pointing in the\r\ncontrary direction, is folded upon it. In many flies (_Muscidæ_) a\r\nvertical frontal cavity receives the antennæ, which point downwards\r\nduring repose[1576]. _Cryptocerus_, a very remarkable ant, has on\r\nits head a singular square plate, the sides of which form a deep\r\nlongitudinal cavity: in this cavity the antennæ, quite concealed,\r\nrepose in safety. A cavity equally remarkable is exhibited by the\r\nwater-scorpions, particularly _Belostoma_, in which is a _very_ deep\r\nkidney-shaped box, between the eye and throat, to receive and defend\r\nits singular antennæ[1577]; which, when they are reposing, is closed\r\nby the exterior harder joints, and from which it seems as if they\r\nturned out, like a sentinel out of his box. In some aquatic genera\r\nof beetles, as _Gyrinus_, _Parnus_, &c. they are withdrawn within\r\na lateral cavity of the same part, and are defended from the water\r\nexternally by the auricle at their base[1578]. The flabellated and\r\nlamellated antennæ, previous to their being folded for repose, close\r\nall their plates; which in action are as widely expanded as possible,\r\nso as to form a knob; and in some the middle piece is entirely\r\nconcealed, as if in a box. In broken antennæ, or those in which the\r\nclavolet forms an angle with the scape, the former is folded upon the\r\nlatter, with its point downwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Subfacies._--Having dispatched the _Facies_, or _upper_ side of\r\nthe head, I am next to consider the _Subfacies_, or _under_ side:\r\nbut as the principal parts that occupy this side have been already\r\nconsidered, I shall have no occasion to detain you long.\r\n\r\ni. _Jugulum_[1579].--This part, which may be regarded as analogous to\r\nthe throat in vertebrate animals, lies between the cheeks; from which\r\nit may usually be distinguished by being more lubricous and tumid, and\r\noften separated by an impressed line. It is particularly conspicuous\r\nand elevated in the Lamellicorn beetles, and calculated by its\r\nlubricity for easy motion in the lower side of the cavity of the chest.\r\nIts apex is the base in which the _mentum_ sits. It is not necessary to\r\nenlarge further upon it, as it seldom exhibits striking characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Collum_[1580].--In a large proportion of insects the head\r\ninosculates in the trunk without the intervention of a neck, or\r\na constriction of the head behind. In the Orders _Orthoptera_,\r\n_Trichoptera_, _Lepidoptera_, _Hymenoptera_, and _Diptera_, no\r\ninstance of it that I recollect occurs: in the _Coleoptera_ there\r\nare many. In the Predaceous beetles, though several have no distinct\r\nneck, yet others, as _Anthia_, &c. have a short and thick one;\r\nand some few, as _Colliuris_, _Agra_, &c. one more pronounced.\r\nLatreille has named a tribe in this Order _Trachelides_, from the\r\ncircumstance of their having a neck: in this tribe you will find the\r\nblister-beetles (_Cantharis_ and _Mylabris_) both of the moderns and\r\nthe ancients. In the _Hemiptera_ order the water-scorpions _Nepa_,\r\n&c. have a thick short neck; and _Zelus_, (a kind of bug,) one\r\nlonger and more slender; and, like _Raphidia_, the snake's-head fly,\r\nwhich is similarly circumstanced, has the air of a serpent. Other\r\n_Neuroptera_, likewise, have a neck; as _Hemerobius_, _Corydalis_,\r\n&c. This part presents no other features that merit notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Myoglyphides_[1581].--The _Myoglyphides_, or muscle-notches, are\r\nsinuses, some shallow and some deeper, in the posterior margin of the\r\nupper side of the head, to which the levator muscles are affixed.\r\nThey seem principally confined to the _Coleoptera_; though, in some\r\ncases at least, they may be traced in the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_.\r\nThese notches vary in number and depth in different insects. Thus\r\nin _Buprestis_ there is only _one_ deep one[1582]: in _Copris_\r\nthere are _two_ shallow ones, in a deep sinus separated by a small\r\nprominence[1583]: in _Elater_ and _Lamia_ there are also two not in a\r\nsinus; and in _Calandra Palmarum_ there are four, two on each side,\r\nwith a prominent lobe between them[1584]. To each of these notches,\r\nat its under margin, below the ligament that unites the occiput to\r\nthe trunk, a muscle to raise the head is usually attached.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1151] See above, p. 86, 110, 243--.\r\n\r\n[1152] Many species of _Hister_, _Curculio_ L., _Doryphora_ Illig.\r\nare extremely hard, while _Cantharis_ Geoffr., _Meloe_ F., and\r\n_Telephorus_ Geoffr., are very soft.\r\n\r\n[1153] Thenard _Traité de Chimie Elémentaire_, iii. 637. n. 2005.\r\nThe other products he mentions are--a green oil, a yellow substance,\r\na black ditto, acetic acid, uric acid, phosphate of magnesia.

As the very remarkable maxillary palpi of\r\nthat extraordinary Coleopterous genus _Atractocerus_ seem not to have\r\nbeen so fully described as they deserve, I shall give here a minute\r\ndetail of their composition. They consist of _four_ joints: the first\r\nis wide and short, and somewhat platter-shaped; the second is much\r\nsmaller and shorter: the third is concavo-convex, or shaped like a\r\nshallow bowl: towards the breast this joint is elevated, and on the\r\nelevated edge sits the last joint, which is longer than all the rest\r\ntaken together. In my specimen it points towards the breast; its\r\nunder side is entire and slightly curved, but in the upper side are\r\ntwo rows of lamellæ (_b_), placed alternately _nine_ on each side,\r\nwith an odd one at the end: these lamellæ are full of minute papillæ,\r\nand furrowed on the side next the mouth. From between the first pair\r\na slender exarticulate hairy branch or appendage emerges (_a_), which\r\nforms nearly a right angle with the main stem. The _labial palpi_\r\nappear to consist of _three_ joints; the two first very short, and\r\nthe last large, ovate, and acute. This description is not taken from\r\n_A. necydaloides_, but from a Brazilian species more than five times\r\nits size, which I have named _A. grandis_.\r\n\r\n[1313] PLATE VI. VII.

It will first, however, be necessary to\r\nassign my reasons for the nomenclature of its parts that I have adopted.\r\n\r\nHad the entomological world been universally agreed upon this\r\nsubject, and there was an established system of Orismology[1585],\r\nI should have proposed no alteration without great reluctance, and\r\nthe fullest conviction of the absolute necessity of some change;\r\nbut as the standard of language in our science is still unsettled,\r\nand different terms are used by different writers, there seems full\r\nliberty left to me to select those that appear upon the whole most\r\nappropriate; and where proper and significant terms seem wanting, to\r\ninvent new ones. M. Latreille, in a late Essay[1586], has proposed\r\nmany changes of this kind, and seems to hesitate concerning the\r\nadoption of some of those recently coined in France for the parts of\r\nthe trunk[1587]; it may therefore, I think, be permitted me to labour\r\na little in this hitherto imperfectly cultured field, and to suggest\r\nsuch improvements as the subject may seem to require or admit.\r\n\r\nLinné called the part we are now considering the _trunk_, its\r\nupper-side he usually denominated the _thorax_, and its under-side\r\nthe _breast_: he notices also the _scutellum_ and _sternum_[1588].\r\nAs the _prothorax_ and _scutellum_ are the only _apparent_ parts of\r\nthe back of the trunk in his first Orders (_Coleoptera_, _Hemiptera_\r\nL.), the rest being covered, in noticing these he puts the part for\r\nthe whole, calling the _prothorax_ the _thorax_, but which strictly\r\nwas not synonymous with what he called by the same name in the other\r\nOrders. Linné's phraseology with regard to the trunk of insects was\r\nadopted by Fabricius and other Entomologists, till Illiger employed\r\nthe term _thorax_ to designate the whole of the trunk[1589], calling\r\nthe upper part _thorax superior_ and the lower _thorax inferior_.\r\nM. De Blainville, M. Latreille, and other French writers, improved\r\nupon this, naming the upper part the back (_dorsum_), and the lower\r\nthe breast (_pectus_); and dividing the trunk, or according to\r\nthem _thorax_, into three sections, each bearing a pair of legs.\r\nBut I see no sufficient reason for this alteration--the terms\r\n_trunk_, _thorax_, and _breast_, in the common acceptation are well\r\nunderstood, and lead to no confusion or glaring impropriety; I\r\nshall therefore adhere to the old phraseology, especially as French\r\nEntomologists in popular language still do the same.\r\n\r\nAs to the division of the trunk into segments by M. Latreille and\r\nothers, it has been regarded as consisting of _three_ primary ones,\r\nwhich have been called in the order of their occurrence, reckoning\r\nfrom the head--_prothorax_, _mesothorax_, _metathorax_. The first\r\nof these segments, however--and the learned Entomologist just named\r\nseems to hint as much[1590]--is usually more distinct from the other\r\ntwo, than they are from each other. If this idea be correct, the\r\ntrunk is properly resolvable into _two_ primary segments, the first\r\nbearing the arms or fore-legs, and the other the proper legs and\r\nthe organs of flight. M. Chabrier calls the latter _tronc alifère_,\r\nor wing-trunk;--a happy term, which I have adopted and latinized,\r\ncalling it the alitrunk (_alitruncus_): the first segment, because\r\nit bears the fore-legs, I have named manitrunk (_manitruncus_). I\r\nadopt likewise the terms above mentioned, _prothorax_, _mesothorax_,\r\n_metathorax_, to signify the three segments into which the thorax of\r\nLinné, or the _upper_ side of the trunk, is resolvable; and those of\r\nthe breast I denominate _antepectus_, _medipectus_, and _postpectus_.\r\nIf terms be thought necessary to designate the two intire segments\r\ninto which the alitrunk is resolvable, the first may be the meditrunk\r\n(_meditruncus_), and the other the potrunk (_potruncus_).\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Substance._--With regard to its _substance_, the trunk in general\r\nis softer than the head, and harder than the abdomen, especially as\r\nto its upper surface; but in some cases, where it is not protected by\r\nthe elytra, as in the rove-beetles (_Staphylinus_ L.), the abdomen\r\nappears as hard as the trunk. Though usually not very different from\r\nthe elytra in this respect, in _Meloe_, _Lytta_, and other vesicatory\r\nbeetles, it is of a firmer consistence.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _General Form._--In the _Coleoptera_ Order the only part of\r\nthe trunk that is visible on its upper-side is the _prothorax_:\r\nthe _mesothorax_, with the exception of the _scutellum_, and the\r\n_metathorax_, being entirely concealed by it and the elytra; so that,\r\nwith regard to _shape_, it may nearly be considered as merging in the\r\n_prothorax_. Below it is more visible, and may be stated as more or\r\nless quadrangular; in oblong beetles inclining to a parallelogram,\r\nand in shorter or hemispherical ones to a square. In the majority\r\nit is more convex below than above, except in the case of the\r\nhemispherical or gibbous beetles (_Coccinella_, _Erotylus_, &c.), in\r\nwhich the under-side is flat and the upper-side very convex. In the\r\n_Diurnal Lepidoptera_ the trunk approaches to a cubical shape, in the\r\n_Nocturnal_ it is more spherical. A similar difference obtains in\r\nthe _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_: in the bees, wasps and flies, the\r\ntrunk approaching to the figure of a sphere; in the ants, _Scoliæ_,\r\ncrane-flies, &c. to that of a cube. The upper part of it in many\r\n_Ichneumonidæ_, female ants, &c. is very elevated, forming an arch,\r\nand sloping towards the abdomen. In general it may be observed with\r\nrespect to the remaining Orders, that the form of the trunk merges\r\nin that of the whole body, the tendency of which is often to a\r\nthree-sided figure.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Proportions._--The trunk is usually longer and larger than\r\nthe head and longer than the abdomen, but not wider: but there are\r\nexceptions to both these rules. In _Colliuris_, _Mantis_, &c.,\r\nit is more _slender_; and in _Atta megacephala_ and some neuter\r\nants, it is _shorter_ than the _head_; in _Atractocerus_, many\r\n_Staphylinidæ_, _Phasma_, the _Libellulina_, the _Lepidoptera_, and\r\nvarious _Hymenoptera_, it is shorter, and in the _Mantidæ_ more\r\n_slender_ than the _abdomen_. The greatest disproportion between it\r\nand the last part is exhibited by the genus _Evania_, parasitic upon\r\nthe _Blattæ_, in which the abdomen appears merely as a minute and\r\ninsignificant appendage of the trunk. The vertical diameter of this\r\npart, almost without exception, is greater than that of either head\r\nor abdomen. When we consider that it contains the muscles that move\r\nboth the organs of flight and the legs, we see clearly the reason why\r\nthe CREATOR gave it greater volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Composition._--I lately intimated to you that the trunk, though\r\nresolvable into _three_ segments, in most cases properly consists\r\nof only _two_ primary ones. Whoever examines the perfect insects of\r\nevery Order, except the _Aptera_[1591], will find this distinction\r\nstrongly pointed out, not only by the different direction of the\r\nfirst pair of legs from that of the two last, but also in a large\r\nproportion by a deep incisure; and in all it is further manifested\r\nby the anterior segment having a motion distinct from that of the\r\nrest of the trunk, and separating readily from it; and this not only\r\nwhere it is large, as in insects that have a thoracic shield, but\r\nalso in those in which the _prothorax_ is less apparent: whereas the\r\nother two pedigerous segments have little or no distinct motion,\r\nwill not readily separate from each other, and in some cases exhibit\r\nno pectoral suture between them. Sometimes, however, these two last\r\nsegments are more prominently distinguished: in _Lytta_, _Mylabris_,\r\nand other vesicatory beetles, they are separated below by an\r\nincisure, or rather the first or mid-leg segment, is not nearly so\r\nelevated as that of the hind-legs. In some ants (_Atta_ Latr.), in\r\nthe neuters, there is no distinction of segments in the trunk; but\r\nin others (_Formica_ Latr.) it follows the general law, and consists\r\nof three. In the _Arachnida_, with the exception of _Galeodes_, in\r\nwhich the head is distinct, and the three segments of the trunk may\r\nbe traced, these parts together form only a single segment. Induced\r\nby these reasons, I consider the trunk as consisting in general of\r\ntwo _primary_ segments, the _manitrunk_ and _alitrunk_: the latter\r\nresolvable into two _secondary_ ones.\r\n\r\n* _Manitruncus_[1592].--The manitrunk, then, is the anterior section\r\nof the trunk, which bears the arms and contains the muscles that move\r\nthem. This part has free motion, or a motion independent of that of\r\nthe rest of the trunk. This indeed seems a necessary result of the\r\ndirection and uses of the arms. It consists of an upper and lower\r\npart--the _prothorax_ and _antepectus_.\r\n\r\ni. _Prothorax_[1593].--The upper part of the manitrunk in the\r\n_Coleoptera_, _Orthoptera_, and _Hemiptera_, is by far the most\r\nconspicuous part of the trunk, but in the other Orders it is less so.\r\nWith respect to it, insects may be divided into two classes--those\r\nthat have and those that have not a _prothorax_. In the _Coleoptera_\r\nOrder it is remarkable both for size and variations in its shape and\r\nsculpture. In the _Orthoptera_, though less various, it is almost\r\nequally conspicuous, especially in _Blatta_. In the _Homopterous_\r\nsection of the _Hemiptera_, in many genera it has become extremely\r\nshort; while in the _Heteropterous_ section its dimensions are not\r\nmuch reduced. In the majority of the _Neuroptera_, likewise, it is\r\ncomparatively large; in the _Libellulina_ much shorter, and in the\r\n_Trichoptera_ and _Lepidoptera_ nearly evanescent[1594].--In the\r\n_Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_, with very few exceptions, the thoracic\r\nshield altogether disappears, at least if I am correct in an idea,\r\nwhich I shall hereafter explain, that the _collar_ usually regarded\r\nas the analogue of the _prothorax_, is really a part of the alitrunk.\r\nIn these last Orders, though there is no true _prothorax_, the\r\nmanitrunk still remains under the form of an _antepectus_, bearing\r\nthe fore-legs, and containing the muscles that move them.\r\n\r\nThe prothorax of insects may in general be considered with respect\r\nto its _parts_, _margin_, _appendages_, _shape_, _sculpture_,\r\n_clothing_, and _proportions_.\r\n\r\n1. The _prothorax_, regarded as a whole, distinct from the\r\n_antepectus_ or fore-breast, consists commonly of _two_ pieces--the\r\n_shield_, or upper part[1595], and the _ora_, or under part[1596].\r\nIn the shield you are to observe its _apex_[1597], _base_[1598],\r\n_sides_[1599], _limb_[1600], and _disk_[1601]. The _apex_ is the\r\npart next the _head_; the _base_ that next the _abdomen_; the\r\n_limb_ the _circumference_, and the _disk_ the _central_ part. In\r\nmany _Orthoptera_ and Heteropterous _Hemiptera_, the shield appears\r\nfurther to consist of two pieces, an anterior and posterior one.\r\nThe _ora_ is a continuation of the shield below the lateral margin,\r\nturned downwards and inwards towards the fore-breast and the legs,\r\nbut separated from the former in most cases by a suture, as in\r\n_Carabus_ L.; and in others merely by an impressed line, as in\r\n_Blaps_ F.; but in _Curculio_ and _Cerambyx_ L., &c. there is no ora,\r\nthe shield being without a lateral margin, and forming one piece with\r\nthe _antepectus_. The part we are now considering varies in different\r\ngenera. Sometimes it is very _narrow_, as in _Scarites_; at others\r\nvery _broad_, as in _Buprestis_, _Nepa_, &c. In _Lampyris_, except\r\n_L. italica_, and affinities, it projects posteriorly into a _lobe_\r\nor tooth, which forms a right angle with the rest of the _ora_, and\r\nbecomes the lower part of the cavity that receives the head; and in\r\n_Dermestes_ this part is excavated into an anterior and posterior one\r\nwhich admits the antennæ and arms when folded for repose.\r\n\r\n2. The _margin_ of the _prothorax_ is a ridge, either defining its\r\nsides or whole circumference. In many cases this margin is broad and\r\ndilated, but in others it is merely a thread or bead that separates\r\nthe shield from the _ora_. Though generally terminating the upper\r\nsurface, it sometimes, as in _Staphylinus_, dips below it. In many\r\ninsects, however, as I just observed, the thoracic shield has no\r\nlateral margin whatever.\r\n\r\n3. Various and singular are the _appendages_ with which the\r\n_prothorax_ of numerous insects is furnished. Many of these are\r\n_sexual_ distinctions, and have been before described to you[1602];\r\nbut there are others common to both sexes, the most remarkable of\r\nwhich I shall notice.--Some are distinguished by a long _horn_ which\r\noverhangs the head, as _Membracis cultrata_, _ensata_, &c.[1603];\r\nin others it stands upright, as in _Centrotus spinosus_[1604];\r\n_C. Taurus_ has a pair of thoracic horns like those of a bull,\r\nonly dorsal[1605]; in _Ledra aurita_ they are flat, and represent\r\nears[1606]; in some species of _Tingis_ (_T. Echii_, _Pyri_, &c.)\r\na kind of reticulated hood, resembling lace, is elevated from the\r\nanterior part of the _prothorax_, which receives and shelters the\r\nhead[1607]. In _Centrotus globularis_ and _clavatus_ F., especially\r\nthe former, the part in question is armed by a most singular and\r\nwonderful apparatus of balls and spines,--in one case standing\r\nerect[1608], and in the other being horizontal[1609],--which gives\r\nthese animals a most extraordinary appearance. In many of the species\r\nhere quoted the _prothorax_ is producted posteriorly into a long\r\nscutelliform horizontal horn, which more or less covers the wings and\r\nabdomen; a circumstance which also distinguishes the genus _Acrydium_\r\nF. (_Tetrix_ Latr.). This horn seems to have been sometimes regarded\r\nby Linné and Fabricius as a real _scutellum_, and sometimes only as\r\na process of the prothorax: but that it is merely the latter will be\r\nevident to you, if you examine carefully any insect furnished with\r\nthis appendage; for if you remove that part, you will discover the\r\ntrue scutellum and other parts of the trunk concealed beneath it. A\r\nvery remarkable prothoracic appendage is exhibited by some species\r\nof _Mantis_. In general the part we are treating of in this tribe is\r\nvery slender; but in _M. strumaria_, _gongyloides_, &c., it appears\r\ndilated to a vast width, and assumes, either partially or generally,\r\na subrhomboidal form; but if it is more closely examined, it will be\r\nfound that the form of the _prothorax_ is really similar to that of\r\nthe rest of the tribe, but that this part is furnished on each side,\r\neither on its whole length or anteriorly, with a large membranous\r\nflat subtriangular appendage resembling parchment[1610]. Perhaps\r\nthis kind of sail may be useful to the animal in flight. In _Prionus\r\ncoriarius_ &c. its sides are armed with teeth, and in many _Lamiæ_,\r\n_Cerambyces_, and other Capricorn beetles, and often in various bugs\r\n(_Pentatoma_ Latr.) with sharp fixed spines. But the _prothorax_\r\nhas _moveable_ as well as _fixed_ appendages; of this kind are\r\nthose spines (_umbones_), whose base is a spherical boss moving in\r\nan _acetabulum_ of the thoracic shield of the Capricorn subgenus\r\n_Macropus_ Thunb. If I might hazard a conjecture, I should say that\r\nthese organs were given to this animal by an all-provident CREATOR,\r\nto enable it to push itself forward, when in the heart of some tree\r\nit emerges from the pupa, that it may escape from its confinement.\r\nAnother kind of moveable appendages are attached to the thorax of\r\n_Lepidoptera_, usually in the form of a pair of concavo-convex scales\r\ncovered externally with a tuft of hairs[1611]. M. Chabrier, who\r\nexamined these scales in recent insects, describes them as vesicles,\r\nwhich appeared to him full of a liquid and of air, and capable of\r\nbeing alternately inflated and rendered flaccid; he regards them\r\nas accessories to a pair of spiracles, which he looks upon as\r\nvocal[1612], opening into the manitrunk just above the insertion of\r\nthe arms. These organs are quite distinct from the _tegulæ_ that\r\ncover the base of the primary wings of insects of this Order[1613],\r\nand are what, borrowing a term from Mouffet[1614], I have called in\r\nthe table _patagia_, or tippets. Under this head I may include the\r\n_caruncles_ at the anterior angles of the _prothorax_ of a genus\r\nof beetles with soft elytra, named by Fabricius _Malachius_. When\r\npressed, says De Geer of these insects, a red inflated soft vesicle,\r\nof an irregular shape, and consisting of three lobes, emerges from\r\nthe thorax and from each side of the anterior part of the abdomen,\r\nwhich re-enters the body when the pressure is removed[1615]. M.\r\nLatreille seems to think that these vesicles have some analogy with\r\nthe poisers of _Diptera_ and the pectens of scorpions; and that they\r\nare connected with the respiration[1616].\r\n\r\n4. We are next to say something upon the _shape_ of the _prothorax_.\r\nThe forms of the thoracic shield, especially in the _Coleoptera_,\r\nare so various, that it would be endless to aim at particularizing\r\nall; but it may be useful to notice a few of the most remarkable. The\r\nprothorax of _Moluris_, a darkling-beetle, approaches the nearest\r\nof that of any insect to a spherical form, from its remarkable\r\nconvexity; in the wheel-bug (_Reduvius serratus_) it is compressed,\r\nand longitudinally elevated into a semicircular serrated crest: it\r\nis crested, also, in many _Locustæ_ and _Acridæ_, in some having\r\ntwo parallel ridges; but, generally speaking, its surface is\r\nmore depressed. In _Necrodes_ it is nearly circular, in _Blatta\r\npetiveriana_ semicircular, in _Nilion_ and some _Coccinellidæ_\r\ncrescent-shaped, in _Carabus_ obcordate, in _Cantharis_ and _Sagra_\r\napproaching to a square, in _Languria_ to a parallelogram; in many\r\n_Cimicidæ_, _Belostoma_, &c., it is triangular, with the vertex\r\ntruncated; it is trapezoidal in _Elater_, in _Ateuchus_ rather\r\npentagonal, and exhibiting an approach to six angles in some\r\nother beetles[1617]: but the prothorax most singular in form is\r\nthat of some species of M. Latreille's genus _Helæus_[1618], as\r\n_H. perforatus_, _Brownii_, &c.: in these its anterior angles are\r\nproducted, and curving inwards, lap at the end one over the other,\r\nso as to form a circular orifice for the head, which otherwise would\r\nbe quite covered by the shield. Thus the upper portion of the eyes\r\ncan see objects above, as well as their lower portion those below. I\r\nmight enumerate many other forms, but these are sufficient to give\r\nyou some notion of the variations of this part.\r\n\r\n5. The _prothorax_ is equally various in its _sculpture_; but since\r\nin the Orismological table almost every instance of it has its place,\r\nI shall here only notice it as far as it is common to the whole\r\ntribes, genera, or subgenera. The _Scarabæidæ_ of Mr. W. S. MacLeay\r\nare distinguished by a small _excavation_ on each side of this part,\r\nwhich, as has been before remarked[1619], furnishes an elevated base\r\nfor an internal process with which the anterior _coxæ_ ginglymate. In\r\n_Onitis_ and _Phanæus_, to these excavations are superadded a pair\r\nimpressed in the base of the _prothorax_, just above the scutellum;\r\nin _Carabus_ L. a longitudinal channel divides the thoracic shield\r\ninto two equal portions; and many genera of that great tribe have\r\nin addition, at the base on each side, one or two excavations or\r\nshort furrows. _Elophorus_ F. has on this part several longitudinal\r\nchannels, alternately straight and undulated. Generally speaking,\r\nin _Carabus_ L. the _prothorax_ has no impressed points; but in\r\none or two subgenera of _Harpalidæ_ (_Chlænia_ &c.) it is thickly\r\ncovered with them. In numbers of _Locusta_ Leach, the part we are\r\nconsidering is what Linné terms _cruciate_, being divided into four\r\nlongitudinal portions by three elevated lines, the intermediate one\r\nbeing straight, and the lateral ones diverging from it both at their\r\nbase and apex, so as to form a sinus or angle[1620]. In certain\r\n_Acridæ_ K. (_Locusta_ F.) there are only two of these lines or\r\nridges, but notched or toothed; and in some of the genus first named\r\nonly one[1621]; in _Locusta Dux_ and affinities the _prothorax_ has\r\nseveral transverse channels or rather folds[1622], with corresponding\r\nridges on its internal surface.\r\n\r\n6. With respect to the _clothing_ of the _prothorax_, I have not\r\nmuch to say: in Coleopterous insects this part is commonly naked;\r\nbut in some genera, as _Byrrhus_, _Anthrenus_, _Dermestes_, and many\r\nweevils (_Curculio_ L.) it is partially or totally covered with hairs\r\nor scales. In the other thoracic Orders it is usually naked, but in\r\nsome _Neuroptera_, the _Myrmeleonina_, &c., it is hairy; and in the\r\n_Libellulina_ it is fringed posteriorly with hairs.\r\n\r\n7. As to its relative _proportions_, the _prothorax_ is sometimes\r\nrather wider than the rest of the trunk and the head, as in _Onitis_,\r\n_Pasimachus_, &c.; it is considerably narrower in _Collyuris_\r\nand _Odacantha_; and of the same width in those _Scaritidæ_ with\r\n_striated_ elytra[1623]. Again, it is sometimes of the same width\r\nwith the elytra, but wider than the head, as in _Hydrophilus_,\r\n_Dytiscus_, &c.; in some instances it is of the same width with the\r\nhead, and narrower than the elytra, for instance in _Anthia_ and\r\n_Brachinus_. In most _Coleoptera_ it is longer than the head and\r\nshorter than the elytra; but in _Manticora_, the vesicatory beetles,\r\n&c., it is shorter than either. In _Gnoma longicollis_[1624],\r\nit is nearly as long as the elytra; in many _Staphylinidæ_,\r\n_Atractocerus_, &c., longer; in _Phanæus carnifex_, _bellicosus_,\r\n&c., it is longer than the elytra and the rest of the body. With\r\nregard to itself, it is sometimes very wide in proportion to its\r\nlength--_Dytiscus_, _Helæus_; at others very long in proportion to\r\nits width--_Colliuris_, _Brentus_, _Mantis_, &c. In _Flata_, and\r\nmany other Homopterous _Hemiptera_, it is extremely short; extremely\r\nlong in _Gnoma_; in _Sagra_ and _Donacia_ its width about equals its\r\nlength; in _Elater_, _Dytiscus_, and many Heteropterous _Hemiptera_,\r\nit is narrowest before; in _Languria_ it is every where of equal\r\nwidth; in _Anthia_, _Carabus_, &c., it is widest before; and, lastly,\r\nin the _Scarabæidæ_ MacLeay it is usually widest in the middle.\r\n\r\nii. _Antepectus_[1625].--The _antepectus_, as was before\r\nobserved[1626], in some tribes forms one piece, without any kind of\r\nseparation, with the _prothorax_; but very often this is not the\r\ncase. In _Carabus_ L. it occupies almost the whole under-side of\r\nthe manitrunk; but in _Elater_, in which the _ora_ is very wide,\r\nthe _antepectus_ is merely the _middle_ portion of that part. In\r\n_Carabus_ F. &c. between the _ora_ and the base of the arms is\r\na convex triangular piece, distinguished from the rest of the\r\n_antepectus_ by a spurious suture; and in _Pentatoma_ and other\r\nHeteropterous _Hemiptera_ a similar piece is observable, which\r\nterminates in a convex bilobed subtriangular sheath, receiving the\r\nbase of the clavicle[1627]. This piece seems a prop to that part,\r\nand analogous to the _scapula_ of the _medipectus_ and _parapleura_\r\nof the postpectus. I shall say no more upon the _antepectus_, as it\r\nis seldom remarkable. In the mole-cricket, however, one peculiarity\r\ndistinguishes it: it is in this of an elastic leathery substance,\r\nwhile the _prosternum_ is hard, resembling a bone. In other instances\r\nthese parts are both of the same substance.\r\n\r\n1. The _sternum_ or breast-bone of insects consists mostly of\r\n_three_ distinct pieces; in this resembling the human _sternum_,\r\nwhich is described by anatomists as composed originally of _three_\r\nbones[1628]. Each of these pieces is appropriated to a pair of legs,\r\nand each of them at times has been called the _sternum_: thus in\r\n_Elater_ the _prosternum_, in the _Cetoniadæ_ the _mesosternum_,\r\nand in _Hydrophilus_ the _metasternum_, have been distinguished by\r\nthis name. Our business is now with the first of these pieces, the\r\n_sternum_ of the _antepectus_ or _prosternum_[1629]: this is the\r\nmiddle longitudinal ridge of the _fore-breast_, which passes between\r\nthe arms, when elevated, extended, or otherwise remarkable. It is\r\nmost important in the _Coleoptera_ Order, to which my remarks upon it\r\nwill be chiefly confined. In these it is sometimes an _elevation_,\r\nand sometimes a _horizontal_ process of the fore-breast. If you\r\nexamine the great _Hydrophilus_ (_H. piceus_), at first you will\r\nthink that there is only a single _sternum_ common to all the legs;\r\nbut if you look more closely, you will perceive between the head\r\nand the arms a triangular vertical process, with a longitudinal\r\ncavity on its posterior face, which receives the point of the\r\n_mesosternum_ that passes between the arms[1630]: this vertical piece\r\nis the real _prosternum_, and not the other, which really belongs\r\nto the alitrunk. In this case the elevation of the _prosternum_\r\nis _before_ the arms; in others it is _between_ them, as you may\r\nsee in a Chinese chafer (_Mimela_ K.), which imitates the external\r\nappearance of a quite different tribe[1631]; in others again it is\r\n_behind_ them, as in most of the Lamellicorn beetles. In the common\r\ndung-chafer (_Geotrupes stercorarius_), it is a hairy process, which,\r\nwhen the head is bent downwards, is received by a deep cavity of\r\nthe _mesosternum_. The _Dynastidæ_ MacLeay may always be known by\r\na columnar _prosternum_ rising vertically between the arms and the\r\n_medipectus_. Lastly, in other tribes there is a prosternal elevation\r\nboth _before_ and _behind_ the arms, as in _Cerambyx thoracicus_,\r\n_dimidiatus_, and affinities. Of the _second_ description, those that\r\nhave a less elevated horizontal _prosternum_, the point in most is\r\nto the _anus_, but in some to the _head_: thus in _Carabus_ L. it\r\nis generally a subspathulate flat piece, the point of which slides\r\nover the _mesosternum_, or covers it; but in _Harpalus megacephalus_\r\nLatr.[1632], one of this tribe, though similarly shaped, its point\r\nis to the _head_. These horizontal _prosterna_ vary in their\r\ntermination. In that of _Carabus_ L. the apex is obtuse; in that\r\nof _Elater_, above described[1633], and _Dytiscus_ it is _acute_;\r\nin _Prionus lineatus_, _Spencii_ K., &c., it is _bilobed_; and in\r\n_Buprestis variabilis_, _attenuata_, &c., obsoletely _trilobed_.\r\nWith regard to the other Orders no striking features of this part\r\nare observable, except in some _Orthoptera_. In _Acrida viridissima_\r\nK. (_Locusta_ F.) it is represented by two long filiform vertical\r\nprocesses; and in _Locusta_ Leach by a single conical horn[1634],\r\nmistaken by Lichtenstein for a process of the throat[1635]. In\r\none instance, _Gryllotalpa_, this part is a long piece between\r\nthe arms, shaped like the human thighbone or _tibia_, being more\r\nslender in the middle and widest at the ends, and which is of a much\r\nharder substance than the rest of the _antepectus_, and forms the\r\nlower termination of a singular machine which will before long be\r\nnoticed. In many bugs (_Cimicidæ_), instead of being elevated, the\r\nthree portions of the _sternum_ are hollowed out into a longitudinal\r\ngroove, in which the _promuscis_ when unemployed reposes.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous and remarkable appendages of the manitrunk,\r\nare the _brachia_ or arms. I shall not, however, enter into the\r\nfull consideration of these, as they consist numerically of the\r\nsame parts, till I treat of the legs in general. Here it will\r\nonly be necessary to assign my reasons for calling them by a\r\ndistinct denomination. In this I think I am authorized, not only\r\nby the example of Linné, who occasionally found it necessary to do\r\nthis[1636], and more particularly by the ancient notion that this\r\npair of organs in insects were not to be reckoned as _legs_[1637],\r\nbut likewise from their different position and functions. They are\r\nso inserted in the _antepectus_ as to point towards the _head_,\r\nwhereas the other two pair point to the _anus_. With regard to their\r\n_functions_, besides being _ambulatory_, and supporting the manitrunk\r\nin walking, they are applied to many other purposes independent of\r\nthat office,--thus they are eminently the _scansory_ or climbing legs\r\nin almost all insects; in most _Carabi_ L., by means of the notch\r\nand calcar[1638], they are _prehensory_ legs; in _Scarites_ belonging\r\nto that tribe, the Lamellicorn beetles, and the mole-cricket, they\r\nare _fossorious_ legs, or proper for digging[1639]; in _Mantis_,\r\n_Nepa_, and some _Diptera_, they are _raptorious_, or fitted to seize\r\nand dispatch their prey[1640]: they are used also by many insects to\r\nclean their head, eyes, and antennæ, &c. For many of these purposes\r\nthey cannot be fit without a structure different from that of the\r\nother legs, which renders it a matter of as great convenience in\r\ndescriptions to speak of them and their parts under different names\r\nfrom those of the legs, as it is of the arms of man; on this account\r\nit is that I propose to give to the fore-leg and its part the names\r\nby which the analogous parts, or what are so esteemed, in the human\r\nspecies are distinguished;--when spoken of in common with the other\r\nlegs, they may still be called the forelegs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n** _Alitruncus._ The alitrunk is the posterior segment of the trunk,\r\nwhich below bears the four true legs, and above the organs for flight\r\nor their representatives. In treating of this part we may consider\r\nits _insertion_ or _articulation_, its _shape_, _composition_,\r\n_substance_, _motions_, and _organs_.\r\n\r\ni. With regard to its _insertion_, or articulation with the manitrunk\r\nand abdomen, it may be observed that it is attached to both by its\r\nwhole circumference by means of ligament; in the _Coleoptera_,\r\n_Orthoptera_, and Heteropterous _Hemiptera_ being received by the\r\nposterior cavity of the _prothorax_, the shield of which in these\r\nOrders, especially the last, almost covers and conceals it; but in\r\nthe remaining ones it is merely suspended to it. In the former also,\r\nespecially in the _Coleoptera_, it seems more separate and distinct\r\nfrom the manitrunk than from the abdomen, and more independent of its\r\nmotions than of those of the latter part: but in the _Hymenoptera_\r\nand _Diptera_ its greatest separation is from the abdomen in both\r\nrespects. In many insects, as in the Lamellicorn beetles, the\r\nmole-cricket, &c., the _manitrunk_ terminates posteriorly, drawing\r\na line from the base of the _prothorax_ to the _antepectus_, in\r\nan oblique section; in other tribes, as in the _Cerambyx_ L., the\r\nPredaceous beetles, &c., the section here is _often_ vertical, but\r\nin the _alitrunk_ the anterior one is _always_ vertical, while the\r\nposterior, by which it articulates with the abdomen, in the Orders\r\nwith an ample thoracic shield, is oblique, so that the _pectoral_\r\nportion is more ample than the _dorsal_.\r\n\r\nii. As to its _composition_, the alitrunk is usually much more\r\ncomplex than the manitrunk; for, besides the instruments of motion,\r\nit consists of numerous pieces. It may be regarded as formed of _two_\r\ngreater segments, the first bearing the elytra, or the primary wings,\r\nand the intermediate legs; and the second, the secondary wings and\r\nthe hind legs.\r\n\r\n1. _Collare_[1641]. The first segment of the alitrunk is the middle\r\npiece of the whole trunk, and therefore, when spoken of _per se_, may\r\nbe called the _meditruncus_. It consists primarily of an upper and\r\nlower part, which in the table are denominated the _mesothorax_ and\r\nthe _medipectus_. The first piece in the former that requires notice\r\nis the _collar_. I formerly regarded this piece, which is peculiar to\r\nthe _Hymenoptera_, _Diptera_, and one tribe of the _Neuroptera_, as the\r\nrepresentative of the _prothorax_ in the other Orders, and this opinion\r\nseems at this time very generally adopted, but subsequent observations\r\nhave caused me to entertain considerable doubts of its correctness.\r\nMany other Entomologists have thought it improper to distinguish these\r\nparts by the same name[1642]. Much, however, may be said on both\r\nsides of this question, and I shall now lay before you the principal\r\narguments that may be adduced in defence of each opinion, beginning\r\nwith those that seem to prove that the collar _is_ the analogue of\r\nthe _prothorax_. First, then, the collar, like the _prothorax_, is\r\nplaced precisely over the _antepectus_, and being placed in the _same_\r\nsituation, on that account seems entitled to the _same_ denomination;\r\nespecially as in some genera, for instance _Chlorion_ F., it assumes\r\nthe very semblance and magnitude of a thoracic shield, and is separated\r\nfrom the _mesothorax_ by a considerable incisure. Again, in some cases\r\nthat have fallen under my own observation, the collar is endued with\r\nsome degree of motion distinct from that of the alitrunk, since in\r\n_Pompilus_ and _Chrysis_ the animal can make the former slide over\r\nthe latter in a small degree. A third and last argument is, that no\r\n_prophragm_ is formed from the collar: insects that have a thoracic\r\nshield are generally distinguished by having the anterior margin of\r\nthe _dorsolum_ deflexed so as to form a _septum_, called in the table\r\nthe _prophragm_, which enters the chest and separates the cavity of\r\nthe _mesothorax_ from that of the _prothorax_; now in _Hymenoptera_\r\nthis septum is a process of the piece behind the collar, and excludes\r\nit from having any share in that cavity. These arguments at first\r\nsight seem to prove satisfactorily the _identity_ of the collar and\r\n_prothorax_. But _audi alteram partem_, and I think you will allow\r\nthat the scale containing the claims of the collar to be considered\r\nas a piece _sui generis_, dips much the lowest. And, first, I must\r\nobserve, that though in _Hymenoptera_ the collar seems to replace\r\nthe _prothorax_ by its situation, yet it is in fact a part of the\r\nalitrunk; for, if the _manitrunk_ be separated from the latter,\r\nthe collar remains, in most cases, attached to it[1643], while the\r\n_antepectus_ and arm, with the ligament that covers its cavity above,\r\nthe real representative of the prothorax, are easily removed, and this\r\nin recent individuals: as a further proof of this, I must request you\r\nwill examine a neuter _Mutilla_; you will see that in this the collar\r\nis not separated from the alitrunk in any respect, but forms one piece\r\nwith it, while the _antepectus_ is distinct and capable of separate\r\nmotion: further, the action of the collar is upon the alitrunk, it\r\nbeing of essential importance in flight, whereas the _prothorax_ is\r\nof no other importance than as a counterpoise to that part[1644]. A\r\nfurther argument to prove the distinction of these parts may be drawn\r\nfrom the case of _Xylocopa_, a kind of bee. In this genus the collar\r\nforms a complete _annulus_ or segment of the body: now, if it really\r\nrepresented the prothorax, the under side of the segment, as in those\r\n_Coleoptera_ in which no suture separates the upper from the lower part\r\nof the manitrunk[1645], should represent the _antepectus_, and have\r\nthe arms inserted in it; but in the case before us there is a distinct\r\n_antepectus_ bearing the arms received by the socket formed by this\r\nannulus. But the most powerful argument is the fact that some insects\r\nhave both the _prothorax_ and _collar_, a circumstance that completely\r\ndoes away every idea of their identity. If you examine the common\r\nhornet (_Vespa Crabro_), or any saw-fly (_Tenthredo_ L.), you will\r\nfind, as was before intimated, that the real covering of the cavity of\r\nthe manitrunk is a ligamentous membrane, which properly represents the\r\n_prothorax_. In another genus of the same order (_Xiphydria_ Latr.),\r\nthe sides of the _antepectus_ turn upwards and nearly form a horny\r\ncovering distinct from the collar[1646], the ligamentous part being\r\nreduced to a very narrow line, and in _Fœnus_ the dorsal fissure is\r\nquite filled up, so that in this the manitrunk is perfectly distinct,\r\nand exhibits both _prothorax_ and _antepectus_ of the usual substance.\r\nIn _Nomada_ likewise, _N. Goodeniana_ K. was the species I examined,\r\nthere is a short minute _prothorax_ besides the collar. Next let\r\nus turn our attention to the _Diptera_; if you examine the common\r\ncrane-fly (_Tipula oleracea_), you will find, first, a regular short\r\n_prothorax_, to which the _antepectus_, with the arms, is attached; and\r\nbehind this also is a short collar embracing the alitrunk anteriorly.\r\nThe next insects that I shall mention, as exhibiting both _prothorax_\r\nand collar, are the _Libellulina_. These are generally admitted to\r\nhave the former of these parts[1647], but besides this they have\r\nalso the latter, which is the most ample and conspicuous piece in\r\nthe whole trunk[1648]; intervening, as the collar should do, between\r\nthe _prothorax_ and those parts of the trunk to which the wings are\r\nattached. There is one circumstance connected with the subject which\r\nshould not be overlooked. In the _Hymenoptera_, usually under a\r\nlateral process of the posterior part of the collar, is a spiracle or\r\nrespiratory apparatus; in the _Diptera_ there is also one, though not\r\ncovered by the part in question, in the same situation; now this you\r\nwill find precisely so situated with respect to the second piece in\r\nthe thorax of _Tipula oleracea_, proving that this piece is the real\r\nrepresentative of the collar. Enough, I think, has been said to satisfy\r\nyou that I have not changed my sentiments on this subject upon slight\r\ngrounds. Probably traces of the part in question might be detected\r\nin the thoracic Orders in general, in connexion with some vocal or\r\nrespiratory organ[1649]; but having had no opportunity, by an extended\r\nexamination of living subjects, to verify or disprove this suspicion,\r\nI shall merely mention it, and conclude this head by observing, that\r\nthe collar varies most in the _Hymenoptera_ order, and that its most\r\nremarkable form is in _Vespa_, _Cimbex_, _Dorylus_, &c., in which it\r\nbends into an ample sinus that receives the dorsolum[1650].\r\n\r\n2. _Dorsolum_[1651]. Where there is no apparent collar, the\r\n_dorsolum_ (dorslet) is the _first_ piece of the _mesothorax_, and\r\nwhere there is one, the _second_; it bears the elytra or other\r\nprimary organs of flight. It varies in the different Orders,\r\nparticularly with respect to its exposure. In Coleopterous insects\r\nit is most commonly, but not invariably[1652], covered entirely by\r\nthe shield of the _prothorax_, the _scutellum_ alone being visible;\r\nas it is also in the _Orthoptera_ (with the exception of _Mantis_\r\nand _Phasma_, in the first of which it is partially, and in the\r\nlatter intirely exposed), and the Heteropterous, and most of the\r\nHomopterous section of the _Hemiptera_. The scutellum is likewise\r\ncovered in _Gerris_, _Hydrometra_, and _Velia_, and the whole of the\r\nback of the alitrunk by a process of the _prothorax_ in _Acrydium_\r\nF., _Centrotus_, &c. But in the remaining Orders, and the tribe of\r\n_Tettigonia_ in the Homopterous _Hemiptera_, the _dorsolum_ is not\r\nhidden by the thoracic shield. It is usually less elevated than the\r\n_scutellum_; in _Necrophorus_, and some other beetles, however,\r\nthe latter is most depressed. With regard to its _substance_, it\r\nis generally not so hard and rigid as the _scutellum_, but in\r\nmost _Coleoptera_ harder than in the other Orders in which it is\r\ncovered; in the _Hemiptera_, except in _Tettigonia_, it approaches\r\nto membrane. As to shape and other circumstances, it varies in the\r\ndifferent Orders. In the beetle tribes it has generally a sinus\r\ntaken out of its anterior margin, and it approaches more or less\r\nto a trapezium; in _Blatta_ it is transverse and somewhat arched;\r\nin _Gryllotalpa_ it is nearly square, and distinguished besides on\r\neach side by a minute aperture, fitted with a tense membrane, which\r\nperhaps covers a respiratory apparatus. In the locusts it is more\r\nor less triangular, and in _Mantis_ and _Phasma_ long and slender.\r\nIn the _Hemiptera_ the _dorsolum_ appears to consist of several\r\npieces, variously circumstanced, separated by sutures, corresponding\r\nwith which are as many ridges on the inside of the crust[1653].\r\nIn the _Libellulina_ it is rhomboidal[1654]; in _Panorpa_ nearly\r\nhexagonal; in the _Ephemerina_ it is ample and oblong; in _Sialis_\r\nand the _Trichoptera_ this part is represented by three subtriangular\r\npieces, the _scutellum_ constituting a fourth, with the vertices\r\nof the triangles meeting in the centre[1655]; in the _Lepidoptera_\r\nthe part in question is large, and receives the _scutellum_ into\r\nits posterior sinus[1656]. The _Hymenoptera_ usually exhibit a very\r\nample _dorsolum_, mostly subtriangular with the vertex rounded or\r\ntruncated, and pointing in some (_Vespa_ L.) to the head[1657], and\r\nin others (_Apis_) to the anus; in the _Diptera_, except in _Tipula_,\r\nthe parts of the _mesothorax_ are not separated by any suture, but\r\nonly indicated by impressed lines or channels; in the genus last\r\nmentioned, however, the _dorsolum_ is distinct, subrhomboidal, and\r\nreceived by an angular sinus of the _scutellum_, which last, I think,\r\nis not the part that has usually been regarded as entitled to that\r\ndenomination; for this opinion I shall soon assign my reasons.\r\n\r\n3. _Scutellum_[1658]. Some writers on the anatomy of insects,\r\nlooking, it should seem, only at the _Coleoptera_ and _Orthoptera_,\r\nhave regarded the _dorsolum_ and _scutellum_ as forming only one\r\npiece[1659], and others have affirmed that the _Lepidoptera_ and\r\nsubsequent Orders have no _scutellum_[1660]. But as we proceed in\r\nconsidering the _scutellum_ in all the Orders, we shall see that\r\nboth these opinions are founded on partial views of the subject, and\r\nthat all winged insects have a _scutellum_, more or less distinctly\r\nmarked out or separated from the _dorsolum_. In the _Coleoptera_\r\nthe _scutellum_ is usually the _visible_, mostly triangular,\r\npiece that intervenes between the elytra at their base[1661], and\r\nwhich terminates the _dorsolum_. Some Lamellicorn beetles, &c.\r\n(_Scarabæidæ_ MacLeay) are stated not to have the part in question\r\n(_exscutellati_): but this is not strictly correct, for in these\r\ncases the _scutellum_ exists as the point of the _dorsolum_ covered\r\nby the _prothorax_, though it does not intervene between the elytra:\r\nin others of this tribe, as _Cetonia chinensis_, _bajula_, &c.,\r\nit separates these organs at their base, though it is covered by\r\nthe posterior lobe of the _prothorax_: in _Meloe_ F., the elytra\r\nof which are immoveable, there seems really to be no _scutellum_.\r\nGenerally speaking, as was lately observed, but not always, it is\r\ndistinguished from the _dorsolum_ by being more elevated: this is\r\nparticularly conspicuous in the genus _Elater_, in which it is a\r\nflat plate elevated from the _dorsolum_ by a pedicle; in _Sagra_ the\r\nlatter part is horizontal, while the _scutellum_ is vertical: and\r\neven in cases where the distinction is not so striking, these parts\r\nare separated either by a line, or some difference in their sculpture\r\nand substance. In this Order this part varies greatly, and often in\r\nthe same tribe or genus, both in size and shape; being sometimes very\r\nlarge[1662], and sometimes very minute; sometimes very long, and\r\nsometimes very short; sometimes nearly round, at others square; now\r\noval or ovate, heart-shaped, triangular, acuminate, intire, bifid,\r\n&c. In the _Orthoptera_, though less conspicuous, it still is present\r\nas a triangular elevation of the middle of the posterior part of\r\nthe dorsolum, with the vertex either pointing towards the head, as\r\nin _Blatta_, or towards the tail, as in _Locusta_ Leach[1663]. In\r\nthe Heteropterous section of the _Hemiptera_ (which, in columns of\r\n_Mandibulata_ and _Haustellata_, appear to bear the same reference\r\nto the _Coleoptera_, that the _Hymenoptera_ do to the _Diptera_,\r\nand the Homopterous _Hemiptera_ to the _Orthoptera_[1664]) the part\r\nwe are considering is mostly very large and conspicuous, quite\r\ndistinct from the _dorsolum_, and in some (_Tetyra_ F.) covering\r\nthe whole abdomen, as well as the _Hemelytra_ and the wings; it is\r\nmost commonly, as in the _Coleoptera_, obtriangular[1665], but in\r\nthe last-mentioned genus it often approaches to a pentagonal shape.\r\nThough usually so striking a feature in this tribe, in the aquatic\r\nbugs (_Gerris_ &c.) it is covered by the _prothorax_. In some\r\nspecies of _Reduvius_ F. (_R. biguttatus_, _mutillarius_, _lugens_,\r\n&c.) it is armed with one or more dorsal or terminal spines. In the\r\nHomopterous section, where the _dorsolum_, as in _Tettigonia_ F., is\r\nnot covered by the _prothorax_, the _scutellum_, which is merely a\r\ncontinuation of that part, bears some resemblance to a St. Andrew's\r\ncross, and terminates in a fork[1666]; in _Fulgora_, in which it is\r\npartly covered, it is merely the triangular point of the _dorsolum_:\r\nin the _Cercopidæ_, &c., whose _dorsolum_ is wholly covered, the\r\ntriangular scutellum is distinct from it; in _Centrotus_, _Darnis_,\r\nand _Membracis_, in which the _prothorax_ is producted, and covers\r\nthe abdomen more or less, the _scutellum_ is a short transverse\r\ndistinct piece. In the _Lepidoptera_, from the difficulty of abrading\r\nsufficiently the scales and hairs without injury, it is difficult\r\nto obtain a correct idea of the part in question; in the cabbage\r\nbutterfly (_Pieris Brassicæ_) it appears to be triangular: in the\r\nhumming-bird hawk-moth (_Macro-glossum Stellatarum_) it approaches\r\nto a rhomboidal shape[1667]; and in the eggar-moth (_Lasiocampa\r\nQuercus_) it is completely rhomboidal. In the _Libellulina_, in the\r\n_Neuroptera_ Order, it seems to be represented by the posterior\r\npoint of the _dorsolum_, which terminates in something like a St.\r\nAndrew's cross[1668]. In most of the other tribes of this Order the\r\n_scutellum_ is a triangular piece, with the vertex to the head,\r\nreceived between two pieces of the dorsolum; in _Psocus_ it is nearly\r\nlike that of _Tettigonia_ before described. In the _Hymenoptera_\r\nthe _scutellum_ is separated from the _dorsolum_, which it often\r\nembraces posteriorly, as the collar does in front, by a suture; it\r\nvaries occasionally in shape in the different tribes, most commonly\r\nit is crescent-shaped, but in many _Ichneumonidæ_ and others it is\r\ntriangular[1669]; in the hive bee, &c., it overhangs the succeeding\r\npiece of the alitrunk; in _Melecta_, _Crocisa_, &c., it is armed\r\nwith a pair of sharp teeth[1670]; in others (_Oxybelus uniglumis_,\r\n&c.) with one or more spines, and in some with a pair of long\r\nhorns[1671]. Before I describe this part in the _Diptera_, it will\r\nbe proper to assign my reasons for considering a different piece as\r\nits representative, from what has usually been regarded as such, and\r\nwhich at first sight seems the analogue of what I admit to be the\r\n_scutellum_ in the _Hymenoptera_. The _dorsolum_, and its concomitant\r\nthe _scutellum_, belong to the first pair of the organs of flight,\r\nwhich are planted usually under the sides of the former, and in the\r\ncase of _wings_, by their Anal Area, connected either mediately or\r\nimmediately with the latter. Now, if you trace the sides of the piece\r\nthat I have considered as the part in question in _Hymenoptera_,\r\nyou will find that they lead you not to the base of the _lower_\r\nbut to that of the upper _wings_[1672], and in the saw-flies\r\n(_Tenthredo_ L.) you will see clearly that the Anal Area of these\r\nwings is attached to a process of it, a proof that it belongs to\r\nthe _mesothorax_, or region of that pair. But in the _Diptera_, the\r\npart that has been usually called the _scutellum_ is not at all\r\nconnected, either by situation or as a point of attachment, with\r\nthe wing itself, but with the lower valve of the _alula_, which is\r\nwith reason thought to be the representative of the secondary wing\r\nof the tetrapterous Orders. You may see this even in the common\r\ncrane-fly (_Tipula_), in which there is a real _alula_, connected\r\nby means of a lateral process, terminating in ligament, with this\r\nsupposed _scutellum_. If you examine further the same insect, you\r\nwill easily find what I regard as the true one in the bilobed piece\r\nwhich receives the _dorsolum_, situated between the wings, and to\r\nthe sides of which they are attached. In _Asilus_, _Tabanus_, &c.,\r\nthis part is transverse, and only distinguished on each side by an\r\noblique impressed line; in the _Muscidæ_ it is square, and marked by\r\na straight transverse one.\r\n\r\n4. _Frænum_[1673]. This appendage to the _scutellum_ and _dorsolum_\r\nvaries considerably in the different Orders, and in many cases, as\r\nyou will see, is a very important part, being the process by which\r\nthe former is mostly connected with the elytra or upper wings. In the\r\n_Coleoptera_, the elytra of which are nearly stationary in flight, and\r\ntherefore less require any counteraction to prevent their dislocation,\r\nthis part is commonly merely a process or incrassation of the under\r\nmargin of the scutellum, which towards the base of the _dorsolum_ is\r\ndilated to form the socket for the elytra. Its use as a countercheck\r\nin this Order is best exemplified in the common water-beetle (_Dytiscus\r\nmarginalis_). This at the inner base of the elytra has a membranous\r\nfringed _alula_ resembling those of _Diptera_; to the lower fold of\r\nthis the extremity of the _frænum_ is attached, which forms a right\r\nangle with the scutellum, and the upper fold is attached to the base\r\nof the elytrum[1674]. The object of this appendage is probably to\r\nprevent the dislocation of these organs, which seems to indicate that\r\nthey are used more in flight than those of other beetles. The _Blattæ_\r\nalso, in the next Order, have a winglet attached to the anal area of\r\nthe _tegmina_. The _frænum_, as in the preceding Order, lies under the\r\nmargin of the _scutellum_ and _dorsolum_, but which here forms one\r\nuninterrupted transverse line; it is nearly vertical, and is attached\r\nto the _alula_. The structure is not very different in the other\r\n_Orthoptera_[1675], but the _frænum_ is surmounted or strengthened\r\nby one or two ridges; in _Mantis_ it runs from the scutellum in an\r\nangular or zigzag direction--but in all it is attached immediately to\r\nthe _tegmen_. In the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_ it is represented by the\r\nnarrow bead adjacent to the scutellum on each side[1676], which dilates\r\ninto a flat plate as it approaches the _Hemelytrum_, with the Anal Area\r\nof which it is connected. But the Homopterous section of the Order in\r\nquestion furnishes examples of the most remarkable structure of this\r\ncountercheck, which proves that it is really, what its name imports, a\r\n_bridle_. If you examine the great lanthorn-fly (_Fulgora laternaria_),\r\nor any species of _Tettigonia_, &c., you will find adjacent to the\r\nscutellum or parallel with it, on each side a flat plate; and\r\nfrom the angle of that part in the first case, and from one of its\r\nprocesses in the last, you will further perceive a ridge or nervure\r\nwhich runs along this plate, in one forming an angle, and in the other\r\nbeing nearly straight, to the base of the _tegmen_, where it becomes\r\na marginal nervure to a membrane that is attached to the posterior\r\npart of the base of the Anal and Costal Areas; and that this marginal\r\nnervure, like a _trachea_, consists of a spiral thread, or rather of\r\na number of cartilaginous rings connected by elastic membrane[1677],\r\nand consequently is capable of considerable tension and relaxation,\r\nas the _tegmen_ rises and falls in flight. In the _Lepidoptera_ it\r\nappears to be a short piece overhung by the scutellum, which as it\r\napproaches the base of the wing is dilated. In the _Libellulina_,\r\nto go to the _Neuroptera_, it has the same kind of elastic nervure\r\nconnected with the Anal Area of the wing which I have just described\r\nin the Homopterous _Hemiptera_; another nervure, in _Æshna_ at least,\r\nappears to diverge upwards from the scutellar angle to the Intermediate\r\nArea[1678]: a structure little different distinguishes the rest of the\r\n_Neuroptera_, and even the _Trichoptera_. In the _Hymenoptera_ this\r\npart varies somewhat; in the majority perhaps of the Order, as well\r\nas in the _Diptera_, it appears to be merely the lateral termination\r\nof the scutellum where it joins the wing; but in some tribes, as\r\nin _Tenthredo_ L. (especially _Perga_ Leach), _Sirex_ L., and the\r\n_Ichneumonidæ_, a ridge, and sometimes two, runs from the scutellum to\r\nthe wing; the upper one, where there are two, as in _Perga_, being the\r\nstoutest, and connecting with the _Costal_ Area, and the lower one with\r\nthe _Anal_.\r\n\r\n5. _Pnystega_[1679]. We learn from M. Chabrier, that in the common\r\ndragon-fly, a space, consisting of three triangles, which immediately\r\nsucceeds the _frænum_, affords attachment to no muscles, but merely\r\ncovers aërial vesicles[1680]. This is the part I have called the\r\n_pnystega_[1681]. An analogous piece may be discovered in _Phasma_\r\nand _Mantis_ in a similar situation; but I cannot trace it in\r\n_Locusta_ Leach, or in the other Orders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving considered the parts that constitute the _mesothorax_, we will\r\nnext say something upon those, as far as they require notice, that\r\ncompose the _medipectus_ or mid-breast. But first I must observe,\r\nin general of the _medipectus_ and _postpectus_ taken together, or\r\nthe whole underside of the _alitrunk_, that though usually they\r\nare in the same level with the _antepectus_ or under side of the\r\n_manitrunk_, yet in several instances, as the _Scarabæidæ_ MacLeay,\r\nthe _Staphylinidæ_, &c. they are much more elevated than that part;\r\nthey are also usually longer, very remarkably so in _Atractocerus_,\r\nbut in _Elater sulcatus_ and many others they are shorter. These\r\nparts are also commonly rather more elevated than the abdomen,--much\r\nso in some, as _Molorchus_; but scarcely at all in others, as\r\n_Buprestis_, the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_, &c. In some of the\r\nlatter (_Tetyra_ F.) the abdomen seems the most prominent. Another\r\nobservation relating to this part must not be omitted, namely, that\r\nthough in many cases the _medipectus_ and _postpectus_ are perfectly\r\ndistinct and may be separated, yet in others, as for instance the\r\nLamellicorn beetles, the _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_, &c., no suture\r\nseparates them; so that though the upper parts, the _mesothorax_ and\r\n_metathorax_, are separable, the lower ones just named are not so.\r\n\r\n6. _Peristethium_[1682]. The first piece of the _medipectus_ is\r\nwhat I have called, after Knoch, the _peristethium_[1683]. This\r\nimmediately follows the _antepectus_; on each side it is limited by\r\nthe scapulars, and behind by the mid-legs and _mesosternum_. Its\r\nantagonist above is usually the _dorsolum_. In the _Coleoptera_ Order\r\nit varies occasionally, both in form and magnitude, but not so as\r\nto merit particular notice, except that both are regulated by the\r\nscapulars--if these are small, the _peristethium_ is ample; and,\r\n_vice versa_, if they are large it is small. In all the following\r\nOrders, except the _Hymenoptera_, it is equally inconspicuous, but\r\nin them it is often more remarkable. I have a Brazilian species of\r\n_Cimbex_ (_C. mammifera_ K. MS.) which appears undescribed, in which\r\nthis part swells into two breast-like protuberances, terminating\r\nposteriorly in membrane, as if it had separate motion: in the\r\ngolden-wasps (_Chrysis_ L.) it is anteriorly concave to receive the\r\n_coxæ_ of the mid-legs; and in _Stilbum_, of the same tribe, it is\r\narmed with one or more conical obtuse teeth.\r\n\r\n7. _Scapularia_[1684]. The scapulars are situated between the _coxæ_\r\nof the mid-legs and the base or axis of the upper organs of flight,\r\nand they seem to act as a fulcrum to each. In the _Coleoptera_ Order\r\nthey are most commonly quadrangular or subquadrangular, often divided\r\ndiagonally, and sometimes transversely, by an impressed line; the\r\nposterior part, which is usually the most elevated and often has an\r\nuneven angular surface, is that which intervenes between the coxæ and\r\nelytra: where the former are short, as in the Capricorn beetles, the\r\nscapulars are long; and where they are long, as in the Petalocerous\r\nones, the latter are short. The anterior part is that which forms\r\nthe lateral limit of the _peristethium_, upon which it often\r\nencroaches: this part, in conjunction with the _dorsolum_ above, and\r\nthe last-named part below, forms the kind of _rotula_ that plays in\r\nthe posterior _acetabulum_ of the manitrunk, as the head does in the\r\nanterior one. In the flower-chafers (_Cetonia_ F.) the scapulars are\r\nvery thick and elevated, and interpose between the posterior angles\r\nof the _prothorax_ and the shoulders of the _elytra_, which is one\r\nof the distinguishing characters of that tribe: in this case the\r\nlower angle of the scapular connects with the _coxa_ of the mid-leg,\r\nand the upper angle with the axis of the _elytra_; and the most\r\nelevated and thickest part of the scapular is about midway between\r\nthe two. This robust structure seems to indicate that the scapular\r\nhas to counteract a powerful action both of the leg and elytrum.\r\nIn the _Orthoptera_ the scapulars are usually divided into two\r\nparallel pieces, corresponding probably, though more distinct, with\r\nthe two parts lately noticed of those of the _Coleoptera_: the upper\r\nside of the socket of the mid-leg is common to the base of _both_\r\nthese pieces, but the articulation of the _tegmen_ is chiefly with\r\nthe _anterior_ one. In the grasshoppers, locusts, &c. (_Gryllus_\r\nL.) in which tribe this leg is nearly _opposite_ to that part,\r\nthe scapular inclines but little from a vertical position[1685];\r\nbut in the praying-insects (_Mantis_), spectres (_Phasma_), and\r\ncockroaches (_Blatta_), in which the insertion of the mid-legs is\r\n_behind_ that of the _tegmina_, it is nearly horizontal. In the\r\nHeteropterous _Hemiptera_ the anterior part of the scapular is\r\ncovered by the _antepectus_, and separated by a ridge, more or\r\nless pronounced, from the open part; the whole is of an irregular\r\nshape, and nearly parallel with the _parapleura_. In the Homopterous\r\nsection it likewise consists of two pieces, and sometimes of more.\r\nThus in _Tettigonia_ F. it is bilobed, and between it and the coxa\r\ntwo small pieces are inserted[1686]. In some others, _Iassus Lanio_\r\nF., &c., it is not very unlike the scapular in _Coleoptera_, being\r\nsubquadrangular and divided diagonally. In the _Neuroptera_ this\r\npart and the _parapleura_ are parallel, and placed obliquely[1687].\r\nIn the common dragon-fly (_Æshna viatica_) the former forms nearly a\r\nparallelogram[1688], which is not divided by any ridge or channel,\r\nbut its lower half is separated into two unequal parts by a black\r\nlongitudinal line, opposed to which on the inside is a ridge. The\r\nmid-leg in these is connected with the scapular by the intervention\r\nof a triangular transverse anterior piece, which in fact seems\r\nonly marked by a black channel, to which also interiorly a ridge is\r\nopposed[1689]. In the rest of the Order it is divided longitudinally\r\ninto _two_ parallel pieces. In _Panorpa_ the posterior piece is\r\nlonger than the anterior and props the coxa behind; in _Myrmeleon_\r\nand _Perla_, &c., it appears to consist of _three_ pieces. I have\r\nnot been able to obtain a clear idea of them in the _Lepidoptera_,\r\nexcept that they have more than one piece. _Hymenopterous_ and\r\n_Dipterous_ insects for the most part have no scapular distinct from\r\nthe _peristethium_; but in _Cimbex_, _Perga_, and other saw-flies, it\r\nseems represented by its posterior depressed and sometimes membranous\r\npart: in _Vespa_, &c. a small subtriangular piece, just below the\r\nbase of the upper wing, is probably its analogue[1690].\r\n\r\n8. _Mesosternum_[1691]. The central part of the _medipectus_, or\r\nthat which passes between the mid-legs when elevated, protended, or\r\notherwise remarkable, is called the _mesosternum_ or mid-breast-bone.\r\nIn the _Coleoptera_ Order it exhibits the most numerous variations, and\r\nis usually the most strongly marked of any of the three portions of the\r\n_sternum_, affording often important characters for the discrimination\r\nof genera and subgenera. It may be said to be formed upon three\r\nprincipal types--the first is, where it is a process of the posterior\r\npart of the _peristethium_, and points towards the anus or the\r\nhead;--the second, where it is a process of the anterior part of the\r\n_mesostethium_, and points only towards the head: in this case there\r\nis no suture to separate the _medipectus_ from the _postpectus_;--the\r\nlast type is where it is a ridge formed by a process both of the\r\n_peristethium_ and _mesostethium_ meeting between the legs; an example\r\nof this you will see in the common dung-chafer (_Geotrupes_ Latr.).\r\nUpon the two first of these cases I shall offer a few remarks;--the\r\nlast affording no variation need only be mentioned.\r\n\r\nIf you examine the terrestrial Predaceous beetles (_Cicindela_ and\r\n_Carabus_ L.) you will find that the _peristethium_ is usually flat,\r\nterminating towards the _postpectus_ in a kind of fork, the sinus\r\nof which receives the anterior point of the _mesostethium_--this\r\nis the _mesosternum_; but in the aquatic insects of this tribe, at\r\nleast in _Dytiscus marginalis_, &c. the structure at first sight\r\nseems different, for _apparently_ the _prosternum_ is received by the\r\nanterior fork of the _mesostethium_; but if you proceed to separate the\r\nmanitrunk from the alitrunk, you will find that the true _mesosternum_\r\nof the usual form is quite covered by this point, which curves towards\r\nthe breast, is longitudinally concave to receive the point of the\r\n_prosternum_, and permit its motion in the groove. In some Heteromerous\r\nbeetles, as the _Helopidæ_, &c. this part is anteriorly bilobed, so\r\nas to form a cavity which receives the point of the _prosternum_ when\r\nthe head is bent down: in _Helops nitens_ (_Tenebrio_ Oliv.) this\r\nsinus represents a crescent; in _Cistela Ceramboides_ it is shaped\r\nlike the Greek letter γ; in the Lady-bird (_Coccinella_ L.) it assumes\r\nnearly the shape of a Saint Andrew's cross; in _Spheniscus_ K.[1692]\r\nthe _mesosternum_ is wide, concave and wrinkled, with an anterior and\r\nposterior sinus; while in the analogous genus _Erotylus_[1693] it is\r\nconvex anteriorly, and posteriorly more or less rounded; in _Doryphora_\r\nit is a long, robust, subconical horn, often standing at an angle of\r\nabout 45°, overhanging the _prosternum_.\r\n\r\nIn the genus last named, though its _mesosternum_ in its direction\r\nand appearance resembles that of many Petalocerous beetles, yet it is\r\nseparated by an evident suture from the _mesostethium_; but in the\r\nlast-mentioned tribe its representative is a process of the latter\r\npart: yet as the _peristethium_ and _mesostethium_ are separated by\r\nno suture, though in some cases a transverse channel, and in others\r\nmerely a coloured line, marks the point where they may be considered\r\nas soldered together, in these cases the _mesosternum_ may perhaps\r\nbe said to be common to both. In this great family, which includes\r\nwithin its limits some of the most singular and wonderful in their\r\nstructure and armour, as well as some of the most brilliant and\r\nbeautiful of the beetle tribes,--the part in question, in a vast\r\nnumber of cases, will enable the Entomologist satisfactorily to\r\ntrace its numerous groups, not only where it rises or stretches\r\nout into a horn or ridge, but even often where it is merely a flat\r\nspace between the mid-legs. I shall notice some of its most striking\r\nvariations in this tribe. In _Phanæus festivus_, and in _Macraspis_\r\nand _Chasmodia_ MacLeay, it is elongated horizontally, with the apex\r\ncurving upwards; in _Anoplognathus_ it is horizontal, straight, and\r\nfigures an isosceles triangle; in _Cetonia suturalis_, _vitticollis_,\r\n&c. it is very long, passing between the arms and nearly reaching\r\nthe head; in _C. marmorea_, _Lanius_, &c. it is a lofty, robust,\r\nconical prominence; and in many _Rutelidæ_, especially those with\r\nstriated elytra, it is pyramidal or four-sided; it varies also in its\r\n_termination_, particularly in the _Cetoniadæ_; and even where there\r\nis little or no elevation of it, as in the _Scarabæidæ_ MacLeay, it\r\nis often terminated anteriorly by lines that vary in their angle or\r\ncurvature. The genus _Copris_, as restricted by Mr. W. S. MacLeay,\r\nmay from an inspection of this circumstance be divided into several\r\nfamilies. Thus in _C. Molossus_ and affinities its _termination_\r\nrepresents the letter ⅄ reversed, or a triangle surmounted by a\r\nmucro; in _C. orientalis_, &c., it ends in an acute-angled triangle;\r\nin _C. lunaris_, &c. in an obtuse-angled one; and in _C. Iacchus_,\r\n&c., in the segment of a circle.\r\n\r\nThe part we are considering is not so important in the other Orders.\r\nIn the _Orthoptera_, however, it is occasionally remarkable. In\r\n_Acrida viridissima_ (_Locusta_ F.) attached to the anterior margin\r\nof the _peristethium_ are two long triangular pieces which appear to\r\nrepresent this part; in the kindred subgenus, _Conocephalus_[1694],\r\nit is a single piece bifid at the apex; in _Gryllotalpa_ it is a very\r\nelevated hairy ridge; and in _Locusta_ Leach, it is a flat anterior\r\nprocess of the _mesostethium_. In the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_ this\r\npart is often merely a portion of the channel in which the _promuscis_\r\nreposes; but sometimes, as in _Edessa_ F., it is an elevated piece\r\nvarying in its termination. In the remaining Orders, as far as I have\r\nhad an opportunity to examine them, it can scarcely be said to exist\r\nseparately from the _medipectus_, except that in _Tipula_ Latr. a\r\nbipartite subtriangular membranous piece seems to be its analogue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are now to consider the last segment of the alitrunk, which, as a\r\nwhole, may be denominated the _potruncus_; it bears the second pair\r\nof the organs of flight, and the last pair of legs. The upper side of\r\nthis is the _metathorax_, and its lower side the _postpectus_.\r\n\r\n9. _Postdorsolum_[1695]. The first external piece of the _metathorax_\r\nis the _postdorsolum_, which presents itself under very different forms\r\nand circumstances in the different Orders. In the _Coleoptera_ it is\r\nintirely covered by the _dorsolum_ and _scutellum_; it is generally\r\nmore or less of a membranous substance, or partly membranous and partly\r\ncorneous, which enables it to yield more to the action of the wings in\r\nflight; it is usually an ample transverse piece with tumid sides[1696];\r\nbut in the _Scarabæidæ_ MacLeay, it is short though very wide; and\r\nin _Cychrus_, and probably other _apterous_ beetles, it is extremely\r\nminute and almost obsolete. In the _Orthoptera_ Order, I observe once\r\nfor all, the part in question, as well as the _postscutellum_ and\r\n_postfrænum_ are mere counterparts of the _dorsolum_, _scutellum_,\r\nand _frænum_, except that in some cases they are larger[1697]. In the\r\nHeteropterous _Hemiptera_ at first sight it would appear that all\r\nthe parts of the _metathorax_ were altogether wanting or absorbed\r\nin the ample _scutellum_; but if you remove this with care, you\r\nwill find _under_ it their representatives, its lower surface being\r\nhollowed out to receive them. The _postdorsolum_ appears in these as\r\na transverse obtusangular band; in the _Nepidæ_, _Notonectidæ_, &c.\r\nthe three parts of the _metathorax_ seem united into a single plate,\r\nemerging laterally from under the _scutellum_ below the _frænum_;\r\nin which, however, some traces of a distinction between them may be\r\ndiscovered. In the Homopterous section the _Fulgoridæ_ exhibit these\r\npieces very distinctly, covered only at the base by the _mesothorax_:\r\nbut in _Tettigonia_ they are not so easily detected; they exist\r\nhowever as a narrow strip or band, almost concealed by that part.\r\nAs to the _Lepidoptera_ Order, in _Pieris Brassicæ_ at least, the\r\n_postdorsolum_ is represented by a pair of nearly equilateral triangles\r\nwhose vertexes meet in the centre of the _metathorax_, and between\r\nwhich and the _scutellum_ is a deep cavity; but in _Macroglossum\r\nStellatarum_ and _Lasiocampa Quercus_, there appears to be also a\r\ncentral transverse piece between them. In the _Neuroptera_ there is no\r\nmaterial or striking difference between the parts of the _mesothorax_\r\nand _metathorax_[1698]. In the _Hymenoptera_ more variety occurs in\r\nthis part. In the saw-flies, &c. (_Tenthredo_ L.) the _postdorsolum_ is\r\na transverse piece covered by the _scutellum_; in the _Ichneumonidæ_\r\nit is smaller, but not covered; in the _Vespidæ_ it is apparent,\r\ntransverse, and with the _postscutellum_ obtusangular[1699]; in\r\n_Apis_ it is overhung by the _scutellum_. The _Diptera_ exhibit some\r\nvariations in this part. In _Tipula_ it consists of three pieces placed\r\ntransversely, the central one quadrangular, and the lateral ones\r\nroundish; in the _Asilidæ_ and most others of this Order, with the\r\n_postscutellum_, it forms a segment of a circle[1700], sometimes armed\r\nwith a pair of spines, as in _Stratyomis_ F., and is what has been\r\nusually regarded as the real _scutellum_, though, as I have endeavoured\r\nto show, not correctly[1701].\r\n\r\n10. _Postscutellum_[1702]. The _postscutellum_ bears the same relation\r\nto the _postdorsolum_ that the _scutellum_ does to the _dorsolum_,\r\nbut it is seldom, if ever, a distinct piece. In the _Coleoptera_ it\r\nis represented by the longitudinal narrow channel that terminates\r\nthe _postdorsolum_ towards the anus[1703]: this usually figures an\r\nisosceles triangle with the vertex truncated or open; but in _Copris_\r\nthe triangle is equilateral. In the other Orders it is little more than\r\nthe central posterior point of the _postdorsolum_[1704].\r\n\r\n11. _Postfrænum_[1705]. The part now mentioned is much more important\r\nthan the preceding one, and must not be passed over so cursorily. In\r\nthe _Coleoptera_ it usually presents itself under the form of two\r\nlarge and usually rather square panels, the disk of which is convex,\r\nbut the rest of their surface unequal, which are situated one on each\r\nside of the postscutellum[1706]; under the anterior outer angle of\r\nthese is the socket or principal attachment of the secondary wings,\r\nand their basal margin is attached to their outer side; posteriorly\r\nbehind the vertex of the _postscutellum_ the _postfrænum_ is crowned\r\nwith a ridge or bead, below which it descends vertically or obliquely\r\nto the abdomen; this ridge often turns upwards, and proceeds towards\r\nthe middle of the basal margin of the wing. In the Petalocerous\r\nbeetles the part in question is usually more or less hairy; but in\r\nmany others, as the rose-scented Capricorn (_Callichroma moschatum_),\r\n&c. it is naked. At its side you will commonly observe several plates\r\nand tendons (_osselets_ Chabr.) connected _inter se_ and with the base\r\nof the wing by elastic ligaments, which are calculated to facilitate\r\nthe play of those organs. In the _Orthoptera_, _Neuroptera_, and\r\nHomopterous _Hemiptera_, the _postfrænum_ does not differ materially\r\nfrom the _frænum_[1707]. In the Heteropterous section of the last Order\r\nit is usually a transverse ridge terminating the _postdorsolum_, with\r\na bifurcation where it unites with the wing; but in _Tetyra_ F. (at\r\nleast so it is in _Tetyra signata_,) it is a nearly vertical piece,\r\nmarked in the centre with an infinity of very minute folds, which\r\nprobably by their alternate tension and relaxation let out and pull\r\nin the wings. Amongst the _Lepidoptera_ it is not remarkable. In the\r\n_Hymenoptera_ Order it is mostly represented, I think, by a double\r\nridge or fork, sometimes however obsolete, but very conspicuous in the\r\nsaw-flies, which laterally terminates the _postdorsolum_; the upper\r\nbranch, usually the thickest, going to the anterior part of the base\r\nof the underwing, and the lower one to the posterior. You may observe\r\nsomething similar in the crane-flies (_Tipula_ Latr.) and _Asilidæ_. A\r\ntendon proceeding from the point of the _postscutellum_ forms a fork\r\nnear its end, the upper branch of which connects with the anterior and\r\nthe lower with the posterior valve of the winglet; the structure is a\r\nlittle, but not essentially, different in other _Diptera_.\r\n\r\n12. _Pleura_[1708]. By this name I would distinguish the part which\r\nlaterally connects the _metathorax_ and _postpectus_. It includes in\r\nit the socket of the secondary wings. In the _Coleoptera_ this is a\r\ntwo-sided piece lying between the _postfrænum_ and the _parapleura_,\r\nwith the upper side horizontal and the lower vertical[1709]--a tendon\r\nusually proceeds from its anterior extremity to the base of the wing.\r\nIn the _Orthoptera_, _Neuroptera_, and other Orders, it is merely\r\nthe longitudinal line of attachment of that part; but in the genus\r\n_Belostoma_ Latreille, related to the water-scorpion, it presents a\r\npeculiar structure, being a deep channel or demitube, filled at its\r\nposterior extremity by a spiracle and its appendages[1710].\r\n\r\n13. _Metapnystega_[1711]. This part, although in the table I have\r\nplaced it as an appendage of the _pleuræ_, is not always confined\r\nto them, as you will soon see. It either covers aërial vesicles, or\r\nis the seat of a spiracle. In the Order _Coleoptera_ it is of the\r\nformer description. If you examine the _metathorax_ of the common\r\ndung-chafer (_Geotrupes stercorarius_), in the horizontal part of\r\nthe _pleura_ you will see a sublanceolate or subelliptical rather\r\nmembranous silky tense plate, with its point towards the head,--this\r\nis the part we are considering; something similar you will find in\r\nmost beetles; but in some, as _Callichroma moschatum_, it is less\r\nconspicuous. This part, as far as I have observed, is not so situated\r\nin any other Order, except in some Heteropterous _Hemiptera_: in\r\n_Belostoma_ the channel lately mentioned is filled up at its posterior\r\nend by a red organ with an anterior vertical fissure, terminating\r\nbehind in a conical bag: in _Notonecta_ the _pleura_ has something of\r\na plate like that of _Coleoptera_, but of a horny substance. In the\r\n_Orthoptera_ and _Neuroptera_ this part changes its situation, if it\r\nbe indeed synonymous; and as the _pnystega_ follows the _frænum_, so\r\nthe _metapnystega_ succeeds the _postfrænum_. In the _Libellulina_\r\nM. Chabrier found that this as well as the other covered aërial\r\nvesicles[1712], and it probably does the same in the other cases in\r\nwhich it occurs. In _Mantis_ and _Phasma_ in the _Orthoptera_ it is\r\nvery minute; but in _Locusta_ Leach, it is more conspicuous under the\r\nform of a tense membrane, the surface of which is depressed below that\r\nof the abdomen: in _Acrida viridissima_ K. it fills the sinus of the\r\n_postfrænum_, and is vertical, as it is in _Æshna_. It is worthy of\r\nremark that this piece bears some analogy to that below the ridge of\r\nthe part just named in _Coleoptera_, which descends either vertically\r\nor obliquely to the abdomen[1713]. A similar space, though often nearly\r\nobsolete, may be seen in the _Hemiptera_ and _Lepidoptera_. But the\r\nOrders in which this part is most conspicuous are the _Hymenoptera_\r\nand _Diptera_, and in these its aërial vessels are connected with\r\na spiracle. In _Tenthredo_ L. and _Sirex_ L., what Linné named\r\n_grana_, from their situation, should be regarded as belonging to\r\nthe _pnystega_, and whether there is any part representing the\r\n_metapnystega_ I am not quite satisfied; perhaps the membrane at the\r\nbase of the abdomen in _Tenthredo_, and the bipartite piece, apparently\r\nits first segment, in _Sirex_[1714], may be its analogues: but in the\r\ngreat majority of the Order, the convex or flat piece that intervenes\r\nbetween the _postdorsolum_ and its adjuncts and the abdomen, and which\r\nbears a spiracle on each side, is the _metapnystega_[1715]. This part\r\nis often remarkable, not only for its size, but for the elevated ridges\r\nthat traverse it, as in _Ichneumon_, _Chlorion_, &c. In the last genus\r\nit is of a pyramidal shape, with the anterior part horizontal and the\r\nposterior vertical; it is altogether vertical in _Vespa_, _Apis_,\r\n&c. Amongst the _Diptera_, in _Tipula_ it is nearly horizontal, and\r\nshaped like a cushion; but in general in this Order it is vertical, and\r\nconcealed under the _postdorsolum_[1716].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are now to consider the parts that constitute the _postpectus_ or\r\nunder-side of the _metathorax_, and which bears the posterior pair of\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\n14. _Mesostethium_[1717]. This part in _Coleoptera_ is terminated\r\nanteriorly by the _peristethium_, _scapulars_, and _mesosternum_,\r\nlaterally by the _parapleuræ_[1718], and behind by the coxæ of the\r\nposterior legs[1719], which generally are inserted transversely between\r\nit and the abdomen. It is commonly very wide; but in _Dytiscus_ L.,\r\n_Carabus_ L., &c., in which the _coxæ_ and _parapleuræ_ are dilated, it\r\nis proportionally reduced: its length is regulated by the distance of\r\nthe intermediate and posterior legs; where these are far asunder, as in\r\nthe rose-scented Capricorn (_Callichroma moschatum_), &c. it is long:\r\nbut where they are near each other, as in the _Scarabæidæ_ MacLeay, it\r\nis short; its width, however, generally exceeds its length. In shape\r\nit is generally subquadrangular[1720], though sometimes rhomboidal,\r\nand other forms of it occur. Between the hind-legs it generally\r\nterminates in a notch or bifurcation distinct from the _metasternum_,\r\nas in _Hydrophilus_, &c.; in _Hister_ there is no notch, and in\r\nmany _Scarabæidæ_ it projects between the hind-legs in a truncated\r\nor rounded mucro; in the Vesicatory beetles, _Meloe_ L., it is more\r\nelevated than the _medipectus_, towards which it descends almost\r\nvertically; in _Dytiscus_ L., _Carabus_ L., &c., this part is usually\r\ndivided into two by a _transverse_ sinuous channel, and in _Elater_\r\nby a _longitudinal_ straight one. In many _Orthopterous_ genera,\r\n_Gryllotalpa_, _Acrida_ K., _Locusta_ Leach, &c., the _mesostethium_\r\nconsists of _two_ pieces[1721]. It is remarkable that in many of these\r\ngenera, in this part, as likewise in the _medipectus_ and _antepectus_,\r\nare one or more perforations which appear to enter the chest, the use\r\nof which I shall explain hereafter. In the _Libellulina_, as I shall\r\nsoon have occasion to shew, there is a peculiar arrangement of the\r\nlegs and wings, in consequence of which this part is placed behind the\r\nposterior ones. In the remaining Orders, the _mesostethium_, though it\r\nexists, exhibits no peculiarities worthy of particular notice, except\r\nin some _Aptera_ and _Arachnida_: thus, in _Nirmus Anseris_ it is\r\nterminated posteriorly by a pair of transverse membranous appendages\r\nwhich cover the base of the posterior _coxæ_; in _Scorpio_ it consists\r\nof two pieces, the _pectines_[1722] being attached to the sides of the\r\nposterior one.\r\n\r\n15. _Parapleura_[1723]. The _parapleura_, speaking generally, is\r\nthat piece of the _postpectus_ which, intervening between the\r\n_pleura_, _mesostethium_, and _scapulars_, is attached by its\r\nposterior extremity to the _coxæ_ of the hind-legs; by means of\r\nthe _pleura_, from which it does not appear to be separated by any\r\nsuture, it connects the secondary or under-wings with the hind-legs,\r\nas the scapular does the primary ones with the mid-legs; so that the\r\ndirection of the _parapleura_ depends upon the relative situation\r\nof the legs and wings. In Coleopterous insects its direction is\r\n_horizontal_, it being generally a narrow subquadrangular piece that\r\nruns straight from the posterior coxæ to the scapular[1724], and\r\nusually divided into two unequal portions by an elevated or impressed\r\nline. In the palm-weevil (_Calandra Palmarum_) this part is wider\r\nthan usual; in _Dytiscus marginalis_,--in which genus, as likewise\r\nin _Carabus_ L., the _coxæ_ are incapable of separate motion,--it is\r\nnearly a right-angled triangle, and is divided longitudinally into\r\ntwo _unequal_ portions. In the _Orthoptera_ Order this part usually\r\nconsists of two _equal_ portions, and its direction is sometimes\r\nnearly horizontal, as in _Mantis_ and _Phasma_; sometimes forming\r\nan angle with the horizon, as in _Blatta_; and sometimes nearly\r\nvertical, as in _Locusta_ Leach. In the two first cases the wings\r\nare _before_ the legs, and in the last their position is _over_\r\nthem. In the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_ it is parallel with the\r\nscapular, is divided into two unequal portions, and its direction is\r\nmore or less inclined to the horizon[1725]. As to the _Homopterous_\r\nsection--in _Fulgora_ it is of a very irregular shape with an\r\nangular surface, and its direction from the leg to the wing is first\r\nnearly vertical and then horizontal: in _Tettigonia_ it is almost\r\nvertical, and consists of two nearly equal portions. To come to the\r\n_Neuroptera_--in the _Libellulina_ it consists of two pieces, like\r\nthose of the scapulars, but smaller[1726], and its inclination is\r\ntowards the head: in _Panorpa_ also it resembles the scapulars both\r\nin form and other circumstances[1727]. In the remaining Orders it\r\nexhibits no very remarkable features.\r\n\r\n16. _Metasternum_[1727]. The central part of the _mesostethium_\r\nwhen elevated or porrected, or otherwise remarkable, is called the\r\n_metasternum_. In the _Coleoptera_, in those cases, as we have seen\r\nabove[1728], in which the _medipectus_ and _postpectus_ form one piece,\r\nits anterior point becomes the _mesosternum_; but in others, as the\r\nPredaceous and Capricorn-beetles, &c., it is received in a sinus or\r\nfork of that part, or meets it. It is usually neither so remarkable nor\r\nimportant as the _mesosternum_. In _Bolbocerus_ K. it is a rhomboidal\r\nelevation: in _Gyrinus_ a ridge; as also in many _Hydrophili_, in\r\nwhich it passes between the hind-legs to the abdomen, and terminates\r\nin a sharp point[1729]; and in _Dytiscus_ its two diverging lobes\r\ncover the base of the posterior trochanters[1730]. In the _Orthoptera_\r\nOrder this part is not remarkable; but in _Acrida viridissima_ K. it\r\nconsists of three triangular pieces, the lateral ones being erect,\r\nand the intermediate one horizontal: in _Locusta_ Leach it resembles\r\nthe _mesosternum_[1731]. In the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_ the whole\r\n_mesostethium_ is elevated, and terminates at both ends in a fork,\r\nthe anterior one receiving the point of the _promuscis_, and the\r\nposterior one that of the _epigastrium_: in the Homopterous section,\r\nthe _Tettigoniæ_ F. have usually a distinct metasternal point between\r\ntheir hind-legs. In the remaining Orders there is no _metasternum_,\r\nor no remarkable one, except in one singular Hymenopterous genus,\r\n_Evania_, the parasite of the _Blattæ_[1732], in which there is a\r\nforked posterior process of the _mesostethium_ with recurved points.\r\n\r\n17. _Opercula_[1733]. By this term I distinguish those plates, before\r\nlargely described[1734], which cover the drums of male _Tettigoniæ_ F.;\r\nand likewise those called also by the same name by M. Chabrier[1735],\r\nwhich cover, in many cases, the _vocal apparatus_ of the trunk of\r\ninsects: those of _Melolontha vulgaris_ he describes as situated below\r\nthe wings, and between the two segments of the _alitrunk_[1736]; and\r\nif you take this insect and remove the elytra, the _mesothorax_ and\r\nscapulars, under the latter and below the wing you will find an oval\r\nconvex plate, which is probably the part he is speaking of;--but it is\r\nbetter exemplified, I think, in the common _Dytiscus marginalis_, in\r\nwhich it is very distinct as a convex subtriangular plate connected\r\nwith the _metathorax_ by membranous ligament, covering a kind of pouch,\r\nand appearing to open and shut at the vertex[1737].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must here observe, with regard to the _Aptera_ and _Arachnida_,\r\nthat the trunk in them is much more simple than in those insects that\r\nare furnished with _wings_. In the hexapods, in the former Orders,\r\nthough there are usually three pedigerous segments, there is no\r\ndistinction of _dorsolum_, _scutellum_, &c. In the _Scolopendridæ_\r\nand _Scutigera_ amongst the Myriapods, according to the acute\r\nobservations of M. Savigny[1738],--on which, however, some doubt at\r\npresent rests,--there is a remarkable formation, the whole thorax\r\nbeing represented by the single plate that follows the head, to\r\nthe under-side of which are attached the first and second pair of\r\n_palpi_ or _pedipalpi_, and the first pair of legs, representing the\r\nthree pairs of legs of hexapods. In the _Iulidæ_ the three segments\r\nthat follow the head, each bear a _single_ pair of legs, while\r\nall the rest bear a _double_ one: from whence it should seem to\r\nfollow, that these segments and their legs represent the trunk and\r\nlegs of Hexapods. In the Octopod _Aptera_ and the _Arachnida_ the\r\ntrunk consists of a single piece, not separated from the head, and\r\nsometimes not distinct from the abdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. _Internal processes_[1739]. Perhaps you will think that this head\r\nwould be better considered when I treat of the _Internal Anatomy of\r\nInsects_; but as the parts included under it are really processes of\r\nthe _external integument_ of the trunk, it seemed to me best to treat\r\nof them under that head. They are of two descriptions; processes\r\nof the _thorax_ or upper part of the trunk, and processes of the\r\n_breast_ or its under part.\r\n\r\ni. _Processes of the thorax_[1740]. These are the _phragma_,\r\n_prophragma_, _mesophragma_, and _metaphragma_. The first belongs to\r\nthe _prothorax_, the second to the _mesothorax_, and the two last to\r\nthe _metathorax_; each forming a kind of chamber of the under-side of\r\neach segment of the thorax.\r\n\r\n1. _Phragma_. The _phragm_, or _septum_ of the _prothorax_, is most\r\nconspicuous in the mole-cricket (_Gryllotalpa_), in which it is a hairy\r\nligament attached to the inside of the upper and lateral margins of\r\nthe base of that part: inclining inwards, it forms the cavity which\r\nreceives the _mesothorax_. It is not, however, without a representative\r\nin many _Coleoptera_, though in these it is less striking, from its\r\nbeing smaller and taking a horizontal direction. In _Elater_, by means\r\nof some prominent points received by corresponding cavities of the\r\nvertical part of the base of the elytrum, it forms a kind of ginglymous\r\narticulation, which probably keeps them from dislocation in repose,\r\nand, by the sudden disengagement of these points from the cavities,\r\nassists the animal in jumping[1741].\r\n\r\n2. _Prophragma_[1742]. This is a piece usually almost vertical,\r\nbut in _Elater_ horizontal; of a substance between membrane and\r\ncartilage, descending anteriorly from the _dorsolum_, and forming\r\nthe first partition of the chest of the _mesothorax_; it is\r\ngenerally much shorter than the mesophragm. Though very visible in\r\n_Coleoptera_ and the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_, in the other Orders\r\nit is less easily detected, and is sometimes obsolete. It may be\r\nobserved here, that in the _Hymenoptera_, at least in the wasp, the\r\nhive-bee, the humble-bee, and the _Diptera_ mostly, the interior of\r\nthe upper-side of the alitrunk, instead of _two_, seems at first\r\nto be divided into _four_ chambers, formed by _septula_: but as\r\nthese ridges merely mark out the internal limits of the _dorsolum_,\r\n_scutellum_, _postdorsolum_, and _metapnystega_, the last but one\r\nof these being usually less distinct, they seem not analogous to the\r\nthree partitions of the alitrunk in other Orders; so that in these\r\nthe mesophragm at least seems to have no representative, and the\r\nprophragm and metaphragm include between them only one ample chamber.\r\nIn the _Diptera_, wherever there is an external _depression_ or\r\n_suture_ there is a corresponding internal _ridge_ or seam, so that\r\nthe parts seem more distinctly marked out on the _inside_ than on the\r\n_outside_ of the crust.\r\n\r\n3. _Mesophragma_[1743]. This piece also, which forms the middle\r\npartition of the upper part of the cavity of the alitrunk, dividing it\r\ninto two chambers, is most conspicuous in _Coleoptera_. It is usually\r\nin them a vertical piece, resembling the prophragm in substance, but\r\ntwice its height, of a quadrangular shape with a notch in the middle;\r\nit fills the sinus of the _postdorsolum_, the sides of which sometimes\r\ndescend below it[1744]. In this Order the chamber that it forms with\r\nthe prophragm is very small[1745], the motions of the elytra requiring\r\nno powerful apparatus of muscles; but that which it forms with the\r\nmetaphragm, which is appropriated to the muscles moving the wings, is\r\nvery large[1746]. In the _Orthoptera_ the anterior chamber is larger\r\nthan in the preceding Order, which proves that _tegmina_ are more\r\nmoved in flight than _elytra_. In the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_ a\r\nremarkable variation takes place--the anterior being larger than the\r\nposterior chamber; which last, in fact, consists of two, one for each\r\nwing: in these the mesophragm towards the abdomen forms an angle, which\r\nin _Pentatoma_, &c., is acute; in _Belostoma_ a right angle, and in\r\n_Notonecta_ an obtuse one. In the two first the angle of the mesophragm\r\nsends two short diverging ridges to the metaphragm; and in the last\r\nonly a single one: in this also the posterior chambers together are\r\nnearly as large as the anterior. From this structure it should seem\r\nthat in flight the _Hemelytra_ are more important than the wings. In\r\nthe Homopterous section the anterior chamber is the smallest, at least\r\nin _Fulgora candelaria_; and the mesophragm is lofty and bipartite. In\r\nthe _Lepidoptera_ the anterior chamber is the largest, and the part in\r\nquestion conspicuous[1747]. In the _Libellulina_ and _Hymenoptera_ it\r\nis merely represented by a low ridge, and in the _Diptera_ it seems\r\nevanescent.\r\n\r\n4. _Metaphragma_[1748]. This, in many cases, is the largest and\r\nmost remarkable of the three partitions of the upper portion of\r\nthe cavity of the alitrunk, which separates it from that of the\r\nabdomen; it is attached to the posterior margin of the _metathorax_,\r\nand is nearly vertical: in substance it may be stated as rather\r\nfirmer than the two preceding partitions. In the _Coleoptera_ it\r\nis commonly of the width of the posterior orifice of the alitrunk;\r\nand its centre is cleft so as to form a deep sinus[1749] for the\r\ntransmission of the intestines,--a circumstance which also, though\r\nless conspicuously, distinguishes the mesophragm[1750]: from this\r\nsinus it slopes gradually towards the sides, and is sometimes armed\r\nwith an intermediate process on each side[1751]. This structure you\r\nwill find exemplified in the common cock-chafer and many others of\r\nthe Order. I have not, however, discovered traces of it either in\r\nthe _Silphidæ_, _Staphylinidæ_, or the vesicatory beetles (_Meloe_\r\nL.); or even in such species of _Carabus_ L. and _Cicindela_ L.\r\nthat I have examined; while in _Dytiscus_ it is very visible. In\r\nthe _Orthoptera_ it is nearly obsolete; but in _Locusta_ Leach,\r\nunder the _metapnystega_, one on each side, is a pair of seemingly\r\n_pneumatic_ pouches which may be mistaken for it. It is almost\r\nequally inconspicuous in both sections of the _Hemiptera_. As to the\r\n_Lepidoptera_,--in _Pieris Brassicæ_, it resembles in some degree,\r\nthough in miniature, the metaphragm of the _Coleoptera_; but in\r\n_Sphinx Stellatarum_ and _Lasiocampa Quercus_ it has a sinus on each\r\nside, but no middle one. In _Panorpa_ it nearly closes the posterior\r\norifice of the trunk, but in the _Libellulina_ it is a mere ridge. In\r\nsome _Hymenoptera_, as _Cimbex sericea_, the drone-bee at least, &c.,\r\nit is a large convex bifid piece. In the wasps, under the spiracle of\r\nthe _metapnystega_ on each side, as in the _Locusta_, is what I also\r\ntake to be a pneumatic pouch, which might easily be mistaken for a\r\nmetaphragm. In the _Diptera_ Order this part is very conspicuous. If\r\nyou remove the abdomen of any common _Tipula_, you will find that the\r\nposterior orifice of the trunk is closed above by a pair of oblong,\r\nvertical, convex, diverging plates;--do the same by any fly (_Musca_\r\nL.), and you will detect in the same situation a very large convex or\r\ngibbous one notched below, which occupies almost the whole orifice:\r\nthis is the metaphragm.\r\n\r\n5. _Septula_[1752]. These are the _smaller_ ridges of the interior of\r\nthe alitrunk, which afford a point of attachment to many muscles,\r\nand run in various directions both on the interior of the crust\r\nand of the metaphragm. These little seams are not to be found so\r\ngenerally in the other Orders; but very frequently, as has been\r\nbefore observed, where there is an exterior impression of the crust,\r\nor a suture, one of these forms its internal base.\r\n\r\nii. _Processes of the pectus_[1753]. We are next to consider the\r\ninternal processes of the _breast_ of insects: these consist for\r\nthe most part of the _endosternum_, or _internal_ sternum, and its\r\nbranches. As the principal feature of this are the processes which\r\nrising from it serve as points of attachment to the muscles that\r\nmove the legs, &c., I shall confine myself to them--they are, the\r\n_antefurca_, the _medifurca_, and the _postfurca_.\r\n\r\n1. _Antefurca_[1754]. The first portion of the _endosternum_, or\r\nthe internal _prosternum_, branches into the _antefurca_. In the\r\n_Coleoptera_ a plate varying in shape and direction[1755] sends\r\nforth a pair of mostly vertical processes of a cartilaginous\r\nsubstance[1756], differing in height in different genera. In\r\n_Carabus_ L. there is neither this plate nor its processes; but in\r\n_Dytiscus_ the latter are very visible. A very singular and complex\r\nmachine represents the part we are considering in that extraordinary\r\ninsect the mole-cricket (_Gryllotalpa_ Latr.). When we look at its\r\nprodigious arms and consider their office[1757], we may imagine\r\nthat the requisite apparatus for moving them must be very powerful\r\nand peculiar. Their CREATOR has accordingly provided them with a\r\nmachine for this purpose more than usually complex, extending from\r\nthe _prothorax_ to the _prosternum_; the former being its _base_,\r\nand the latter its _vertex_. The cavity of the manitrunk is divided\r\nlongitudinally by a double cartilaginous partition surmounted by\r\na bony frame, with an anterior condyle or tuberosity, with which\r\nthe inner part of the base of the clavicle of the arm appears to\r\nginglymate; and the manitrunk is preserved from the injury the\r\npowerful action of the arm might occasion, by the counteraction of\r\nthis machine, to describe which fully, would demand more space than I\r\ncan afford[1758]. I mentioned under the _mesostethium_, the apertures\r\nvisible in the breast of _Locusta_ Leach and _Acrida_ K. Each of\r\nthese apertures opens into an internal, tubular, horny, process,\r\nwhich arching off is attached at the other extremity to the sides\r\nof the trunk--a pair being appropriated to each segment; the first\r\nanalogous to the _antefurca_, the second to the _medifurca_, and the\r\nlast to the _postfurca_. In the _medipectus_ and _postpectus_ of\r\n_Acrida viridissima_ there is only a single aperture, terminating in\r\na single tube, which after rising vertically a little way sends off\r\na branch on either hand to the sides of the trunk. Where there are\r\n_three_ of these holes, as in the _antepectus_ and _medipectus_ of\r\n_Locusta Dux_, there are _three_ of these processes, the intermediate\r\none being vertical. In the subsequent Orders the processes of the\r\n_endosternum_ are not sufficiently remarkable to require particular\r\nnotice: my further observations upon them will therefore be confined\r\nto the _Coleoptera_ Order.\r\n\r\n2. _Medifurca_[1759]. This part, which belongs to the mid-legs, is\r\nin many cases more conspicuous than the _antefurca_. In _Copris\r\nMolossus_ the _endosternum_ of the _medipectus_ is represented by a\r\ntransverse zigzag ridge[1760] between the sockets of the mid-coxæ,\r\nfrom which proceeds a pair of branches wide at the base and growing\r\ngradually more slender to the extremity[1761], which is attached to\r\nthe sides of the trunk; in _Dytiscus marginalis_ a pair of slender,\r\nvertical, straight processes, fitted with a broad cartilaginous\r\nplate at their apex, rises from the _endosternum_, and sends forth a\r\nlateral one to the side of the _medipectus:_ and lastly, in _Carabus_\r\nthe _medifurca_ is represented by a pair of subtriangular _laminæ_\r\nattached to the sides of the trunk.\r\n\r\n3. _Postfurca_[1762]. This, which belongs to the hind-legs, is the most\r\nremarkable of the pectoral processes, and has been noticed by more than\r\none writer[1763]. It is a kind of trident, the branches[1764] of which\r\nare acute, and on their upper surface longitudinally concave, elevated\r\non a footstalk[1765] inclined towards the _medifurca_, consisting\r\nof two plates, a posterior one supporting the lateral branches, and\r\nan anterior or interior one forming a right angle with the other,\r\nsupporting the intermediate one. This footstalk rises from between the\r\nposterior _coxæ_, which appear in the Lamellicorns to ginglymate with\r\nit at its base. The middle branch of the trident dips to the sinus\r\nof the _medifurca_. In _Dytiscus marginalis_ the form is different;\r\nfor the intermediate branch consists of two parallel pieces, and the\r\nlateral ones are dilated into broad vertical plates: the stalk of this\r\nis triquetrous, and a triple cartilaginous partition appears to go from\r\nits base anteriorly, the lateral ones diverging to the sides of the\r\ntrunk, and the intermediate one running straight to the base of the\r\n_medifurca_.\r\n\r\nIt may not be without interest to state here some of the several\r\nobjects and uses of this structure of the trunk. When our Saviour\r\nsays to his disciples, \"But even the very hairs of your head are all\r\nnumbered\"[1766]--he taught them that the attention and care of the\r\nDEITY were not confined to the mighty and the vast, but directed to\r\nevery atom of his creation--that he not only decreed the number and\r\nmagnitude of the planets and planetary systems, and of their various\r\ninhabitants, but that the most minute and apparently insignificant\r\npart of each individual, both as to its number and form, was\r\naccording to the law by him laid down; and whoever studies them with\r\nattention will find that insects furnish a very interesting homily\r\nupon this text; since in various instances I think I have made it\r\nclear, that parts seemingly of the least importance--as a hair, a\r\npore, or a slight impression--have their appropriate use[1767].\r\nAt first, it would seem that the various pieces of which we have\r\nseen the second primary segment of the trunk of these animals to be\r\ncomposed, would be of little importance; but when we reflect that\r\nthis multiplicity of parts is usually not to be found in those that\r\nhave no wings, whether they be apterous sexes or tribes[1768], a\r\nsuspicion arises in the mind that they must be of more consequence\r\nthan their _prima facie_ appearance seems to warrant:--and this is\r\nreally the case. The _manitrunk_, which is destined principally to\r\nincase the muscles that move the _arms_, did not require to be so\r\ncomplex as the part that had to support the action of _wings_ as\r\nwell as _legs_. In those that have a large _prothorax_, as the\r\n_Coleoptera_, it may, indeed, be useful in flight as a counterpoise\r\nto the abdomen; and since when the wings descend it rises, and\r\n_vice versa_, it may be of some service by its vibrations[1769];\r\nbut for this it required no complexity of structure. But not so\r\nthe _alitrunk_: it consists of parts much more numerous, and this\r\nnumber of parts is of great importance to the animal in its flight.\r\nAll of them are so put together, being lined by a common elastic\r\nligament[1770], as to be capable of a certain degree of tension and\r\nrelaxation, which enables the animal to compress or dilate the trunk\r\nas its necessities require. To cause the elevation of the wings, it\r\nmust be _compressed_ or have its _longitudinal_ diameter _increased_,\r\nand its _vertical_ and _transverse diminished_: this compression is\r\nproduced by the _condensation_ of the internal air, which parts with\r\nsome of its caloric, and by the action of the _levator_ muscles. To\r\ncause the _depression_ of the wings, it must be _dilated_, or have\r\nits _longitudinal_ diameter _diminished_, and its _vertical_ and\r\n_transverse increased_, which is effected by the _rarefaction_ of\r\nthe internal air, and the action of the _depressor_ muscles[1771].\r\nIn some Orders, the _Coleoptera_, &c., this effect is promoted by\r\nthe segments of the trunk, which are attached by loose ligamentous\r\nmembranes, and received, one or more of them, into each other, which\r\nfacilitates the above action[1772]. Thus much for the general use\r\nof these parts. I shall further here mention a partial one of two\r\nof them which seems indicated by a particular circumstance, and\r\nupon which a theory may be built. In some insects the primary and\r\nsecondary wings or their analogues are placed _before_ the legs, in\r\nothers _over_ the legs, and in others _behind_ the legs: but whatever\r\ntheir position, the pieces which I have named the _scapularia_\r\nand _parapleuræ_ invariably connect the one with the other; the\r\nformer, the _primary_ wings with the _mid-legs_, and the latter,\r\nthe _secondary_ wings with the _hind-legs_. This circumstance seems\r\nto prove that the wings by the intervention of these pieces have\r\nan action upon the legs, and the legs upon the wings; and this is\r\nfurther proved in one case by an observation of M. Chabrier with\r\nregard to _Melolontha vulgaris_,--that the levator muscles of the\r\nwings, by means of a long tendon, are attached to the lower part\r\nof the posterior coxæ[1773]. Now, more than one medical friend\r\nhas suggested to me, that what are called the _coxæ_ in insects\r\nare really analogous to the _thighs_ of vertebrate animals[1774]:\r\nconsequently these parts must represent the _coxæ_; whence it would\r\nseem that the wings are really appendages of the legs. It must,\r\nhowever, be observed, that were this opinion admitted, in the\r\n_Aptera_, _Hymenoptera_, and _Diptera_, or even in the _prothorax_\r\nof other insects, there would scarcely be any analogue of the _coxæ_\r\nat all distinct from the trunk itself, of which even in the other\r\nOrders these pieces are component parts. An instance occurs in the\r\n_Strepsiptera_ K., and in which the arms are furnished with an alary\r\nappendage, and the _metathorax_ has none[1775].\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. _Organs of Motion._ We are next to consider those organs attached\r\nto the trunk of insects which are instruments of _motion_. These are\r\nprincipally those by which they are transported through the _air_,\r\nand those by which they move on the _earth_ or in the _water_--their\r\n_wings_ and their _legs_. I shall begin with the first, the\r\n_wings_[1776]. These are not formed precisely after any type at present\r\ndiscovered in vertebrate animals: in some respects they have an analogy\r\nto those of birds[1777]; in others, to the dorsal fins of fishes: but,\r\nperhaps, altogether they approach the nearest to those of the dragon or\r\nflying-lizard (_Draco volans_ L.), which do not, as in birds, replace\r\nthe fore-legs, are kept expanded by diverging bony rays, and are\r\nconnected with the hind-legs[1778]. As the Divine Creator appears in\r\nhis works to proceed gradually from one type of structure to another,\r\nit has been supposed by a learned physiologist of our own country,\r\nthat in winged insects, _four_ of the legs of the Decapod _Crustacea_\r\nare represented by the four wings[1779]: this opinion, however, is not\r\nyet fully proved; a remark which may also be applied to a more recent\r\none of a celebrated French writer, who seems to think their origin and\r\nstructure aërostatic, that they are auxiliary to the legs, and borrowed\r\nin part from the respiratory organs[1780]. Were I disposed to enter\r\ninto these subtile speculations, I might here recall your attention to\r\nthe analogy that, in their metamorphoses, exists between the _Saurian\r\nReptiles_ or lizard tribe and insects, and conjecture that the wings\r\nof the _Draco_ are really representatives of the mid-legs of Hexapods,\r\nthus preparing to disappear altogether; but I shall content myself with\r\nthrowing out this hint, which you are welcome to pursue. The organs of\r\nflight in general may be considered as to their _number_, _kinds_, and\r\n_composition_.\r\n\r\ni. _Number._ The most natural number is _four_, for this obtains in\r\nthe majority. In almost every Order, indeed, there occur instances of\r\ninsects that have solely a single pair or none[1781].\r\n\r\nThese, however, are only exceptions to the rule; but in the\r\n_Diptera_, unless we consider the _alulæ_, the representatives of\r\nthe secondary wings[1782], as a distinct pair, there are never more\r\nthan _two_ wings, and one instance is known in which an insect\r\nof this Order has _none_[1783]. Certain genera or individuals of\r\nthe Tetrapterous Orders are also furnished with _alulæ_: besides\r\n_Dytiscus_, _Blatta_, _Phalæna hexaptera_, which have been before\r\nnoticed[1784], they may be detected in miniature in _Ammophila_ K.\r\nand affinities; these all may be regarded in some slight degree as\r\ninsects with _six wings_.\r\n\r\nii. _Kinds._ Under this head we may consider the organs of flight\r\nas to their _situation_ and as to their _substance_. As to their\r\n_situation_, usually the first pair are attached to the _mesothorax_,\r\nand the second to the _metathorax_; but in one instance, as has been\r\nbefore observed[1785], in the _Strepsiptera_ K., the anterior pair\r\nbelong to the _manitrunk_, and the posterior to the _mesothorax_. As\r\nto their substance, they take the several denominations of _elytra_,\r\n_tegmina_, _hemelytra_, and _wings_, for the most part according to its\r\nvariations, as will be seen more at large hereafter. Under this head I\r\nshall only further observe, that in many instances the organs of flight\r\nappear to be mere _abortions_ or _rudiments_, which serve to exemplify\r\nwhat has been more than once stated, that the CREATOR has seen it good\r\nto approach to new organs gradually as well as to new forms. Thus\r\n_elytra_ are mere rudiments that do not serve to protect the wings in\r\n_Atractocerus_; _tegmina_ in some species of _Phasma_, _Acrydium_,\r\n&c.; _hemelytra_ in the bed-bug[1786]; _wings_ in many female moths, in\r\n_Cryptus hemipterus_ a _Hymenopterous_ insect, &c.\r\n\r\niii. _Composition._ The structure of wings has been before explained\r\nto you[1787], and I shall again have occasion to allude to it; but\r\nhere I wish to call your attention to a circumstance that has not\r\nhitherto, that I recollect, been adverted to; I mean that all kinds\r\nof organs of flight, and it may be traced as we shall soon see even\r\nin elytra, are divided longitudinally into three _areas_ or folds;\r\nthe first or external one I call the _Costal Area_[1788] from its\r\nbeginning with the costal nervure; the second is the _Intermediate\r\nArea_[1789]; and the third is the _Anal Area_[1790].\r\n\r\nHaving made these observations with respect to the organs of flight\r\nin general, I shall now proceed to consider more at large the\r\n_elytra_, _tegmina_, _hemelytra_, and _wings_.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. _Elytra._ These are the wing-covers of the _Coleoptera_ Order,\r\ndistinguished from _tegmina_ by the absence of _nervures_, from\r\n_hemelytra_ by the want of the membrane at the apex, and from both\r\nby their uniting in almost every instance at the suture. I shall\r\nconsider them as to their _substance_; _articulation_ with the\r\n_trunk_; _expansion_; _parts_; _shape_; _appendages_; _sculpture_;\r\n_clothing_; _colours_, and _uses_.\r\n\r\n1. _Substance._ The firmness of the substance of elytra is usually\r\nregulated by that of the crust of the insect to which they belong;\r\nin hard insects they are hard, and in soft ones they also are soft.\r\nThe most impenetrable ones that occur to my recollection are those of\r\nIlliger's genus _Doryphora_, and the softest and most flexile those\r\nof _Telephorus_, _Meloe_ and affinities. With regard to individuals,\r\nthey are mostly as hard as the _prothorax_, and harder than the\r\n_back_ of the abdomen. Elytra also, as far as my observation goes,\r\nare never diaphanous.\r\n\r\n2. _Articulation with the trunk._ This is by means of a process of the\r\nbase of the elytrum which I call the _axis_[1791] or pivot, attached\r\nby elastic ligaments, and certain little bony pieces (_osselets_\r\nChabr.) in the socket under the side of the anterior angle of the\r\n_dorsolum_[1792]. You may easily remove the elytra attached to the\r\n_mesothorax_ from _Geotrupes stercorarius_, which will enable you to\r\nsee the mode of articulation with little trouble[1793].\r\n\r\n3. _Expansion._ It is by means of the bony pieces just mentioned that\r\nthe organs in question are opened and shut[1794] under the action\r\nof the antagonist muscles. In opening for flight the two elytra\r\nrecede from each other, and are elevated so as not to retain their\r\nhorizontal position, which would interfere probably with the play of\r\nthe wings, but form an angle with the body. When they return to a\r\nstate of rest, the sutures usually meet and coincide longitudinally;\r\nbut in some cases when closed, as in _Necydalis_, &c., they diverge\r\nfrom each other at the apex; and in _Meloe_, like the _Orthoptera_,\r\nto which that genus approaches, one laps over the other.\r\n\r\n4. _Parts._ The parts to be considered in an elytrum are the\r\n_areas_, the _axis_, the _suture_, the _margin_, the _epipleura_,\r\nthe _base_ and _apex_, the _angles_, and the _hypoderma_. At first\r\nit should seem as if an _elytrum_ was not like other wings divided\r\ninto areas; but I think upon examination it will be found that,\r\nthough often nearly obsolete, these are represented in it; for the\r\n_epipleura_[1795] with the recurved part of the external margin\r\nseems to me analogous to the _Costal_ Area; the inflexed part\r\nadjoining the scutellum and often going beyond it to the _Anal_,\r\nand the rest of the organ to the Intermediate. All this you may see\r\nin the dung-chafer, _Geotrupes stercorarius_. The _axis_[1796] or\r\npivot by which the elytrum articulates with the trunk is generally\r\nplaced about the middle of its base, but nearer the scutellar than\r\nthe humeral angle, and varies in length and shape in the different\r\ntribes, but not so as to merit particular notice; it may be regarded\r\nas composed of _three_ parallel pieces, one belonging to each area,\r\nthat of the _costal_ being the longest. In many these pieces are\r\nmarked by no line of distinction, but in _Macropus_, &c., they may\r\nbe readily traced[1797]. The _suture_[1798] is the _internal_ margin\r\nof the elytrum from the point of the scutellum to the end. In many\r\nbeetles the right hand suture, looking from the anus to the head, has\r\na lower ledge or margin, and the other, one more elevated, which when\r\nthey are closed lies upon the former; in some _Dynastidæ_ there seems\r\na kind of ginglymous structure in this part, each suture being fitted\r\nwith a kind of ridge which is received by a channel of the other;\r\nin these the suture is generally marked out by an adjacent channel:\r\nbut the most remarkable structure of this part distinguishes the\r\ngenuine species of the genus _Chlamys_, in which both the sutures,\r\nexcept at their base, are armed with little teeth, alternating\r\nwith each other like the cogs of a mill-wheel. In apterous beetles\r\nthe elytra are often _connate_, or have both sutures as it were\r\nsoldered together. The margin[1799] or external edge of the elytra\r\nis generally formed by a bead or ridge, which, except in the case\r\nof the truncated ones, in which it is straight, curves more or less\r\nfrom the base to the apex; this ridge is often recurved so as to form\r\na kind of channel between it and the disk of the elytrum, as may\r\nbe seen in the _Dynastidæ_; in some there are two parallel ridges,\r\nas in _Copris_; in _Silpha_ the margin is dilated; in _Helæus_ and\r\n_Cossyphus_ it is remarkably so and recurved, so that, in conjunction\r\nwith those of the _prothorax_ which are similarly circumstanced, they\r\ngive the animal some resemblance to a small model of a barge. Though\r\nthe margin of elytra is most commonly intire, yet in some beetles,\r\nas _Gymnopleurus_ Illig., a sinus is taken out of it; in _Cetonia_\r\nit often projects at the _base_, and in _Cryptocephalus_ in the\r\n_middle_, into a lobe; in _Phoberus_ MacLeay it is denticulated, and\r\nin many _Buprestes_ more or less serrulated; sometimes it terminates\r\nbefore it reaches the apex of the elytrum in a tooth, as in many\r\n_Carabi_ Latr. The _epipleura_[1800] or side-cover is that part of\r\nthe organ in question, below the margin, with which it usually forms\r\nan angle, being more or less inflexed, that covers the sides of the\r\nbody. It varies in different tribes, being sometimes obsolete, as\r\nin the weevils (_Curculio_ L.); in the Capricorn beetles it is very\r\nnarrow; in _Carabus_, &c., dilated at the base; in many Heteromerous\r\nbeetles, as _Blaps_, _Pimelia_, &c., it is very wide and conspicuous;\r\nin _Cossyphus_ it stands out a little from the abdomen, so as to\r\nform a kind of fence round it. Its _shape_ generally approaches\r\nthat of a scythe, being incurved and growing more slender towards\r\nthe apex[1801]; but it is sometimes straighter and shorter. In\r\n_Geotrupes_ and many other Lamellicorns, the _base_ of the elytrum\r\nis nearly vertical, forming a right angle with the rest of it; it is\r\nusually transverse and straight; but in _Calandra Palmarum_ and many\r\n_Cassidæ_ it slants to the scutellum; in _Chlamys_ it is sinuate,\r\nand in _Elater_ it has a deep cavity above the axis which receives\r\nthe points of the _phragma_ mentioned before[1802]. The _apex_ of\r\nelytra is usually acute, the angle being formed by the confluence\r\nof a curving and straight line: but there are many exceptions; for\r\ninstance, in _Mylabris_ it is rounded; in _Hister_ obliquely, and\r\nin _Necrophorus_ transversely, truncated; in many Capricorns it is\r\nemarginate; in others, as _Macropus longimanus_, it is bidentate; in\r\nsome _Prioni_, _P. cinnamomeus_, &c., it terminates in a mucro at\r\nthe internal angle; and in _Cerambyx Batus_, _horridus_, &c., at the\r\n_external_; and, to name no more, in some species of _Necydalis_ it\r\nends in a long acumen. The _scutellar angle_ in insects that have a\r\nlarge scutellum, as _Macruspis_ MacLeay, is obliquely truncated to\r\nadmit it, but where it is small it is generally rectangular, with\r\nthe angle rounded; in _Buprestis vittata_ it is obtusangular; and in\r\n_Dytiscus marginalis_, &c., it is emarginate. In _Cassida spinifex_,\r\n_perforata_, &c., the _humeral_ angle is producted into an acute lobe\r\nthat stretches beyond the head, and in _C. bicornis_ and _Taurus_\r\nit forms a horn at right angles with the elytrum. In general it\r\nis either rectangular or rounded, with a prominence of the elytrum\r\nwithin it. The _sutural_ and _anal angles_ exist only where the\r\nelytra are truncated at the apex. In this case the _sutural_ is\r\ngenerally rectangular, and the _anal_ rather obtusangular or rounded.\r\nThe _Hypoderma_ is the fine soft membrane before noticed[1803] that\r\nlines the underside of the elytra, the use of which is probably to\r\nprevent injury to the wings from friction with their usually hard\r\nsubstance; this membrane is commonly of either a pallid or brownish\r\ncolour; but in some insects, as _Staphylinus hybridus_, _murinus_,\r\n&c., _Buprestis grandis_, it is of a beautiful green or blue; and\r\nit exhibits the _puncta_, _striæ_, and other modes of sculpture of\r\nthe elytra very distinctly, the pores of which usually perforate\r\nthis membrane[1804]. Just under the shoulders of these organs you\r\nmay observe an oblong and sometimes roundish spot, occasioned by the\r\n_hypoderma_ in that part being particularly tense, and covering a\r\ncavity or pocket which appears to be connected with the axis by the\r\nhollow part, which I regard as representing the Costal Area; this\r\npocket is evidently the analogue of a part in the _wings_ noticed by\r\nM. Chabrier[1805], and named by me the _phialum_: from its connexion\r\nwith the axis by a channel, this part in elytra should also seem\r\ndestined to receive a fluid to add to the weight of the margin and\r\nits means of resistance.\r\n\r\n5. _Shape._ The shape of elytra is various; taken together, in which\r\ncase, in describing insects, they are denominated _coleoptra_, their\r\nmost common form is more or less oblong, or forming more or less a\r\nconsiderable portion of an ellipse; taken separately, it inclines to\r\nthat of an isosceles triangle, with the exterior side curvilinear:\r\ntruncated elytra are generally quadrangular, sometimes presenting a\r\ntrapezium, at others nearly a parallelogram, and at others a square.\r\nWith regard to their proportions they vary considerably, but the most\r\ngeneral law seems to be that the length shall exceed _twice_ the\r\nwidth; in some, as _Buprestis grandis_, it is more than _thrice_; in\r\nmany _Staphylinidæ_ they are as wide as they are long and sometimes\r\nwider; they are generally narrower at the apex than at the base, but\r\nin some species of _Lycus_, as _L. fasciatus_, &c., the reverse takes\r\nplace; in _Telephorus_ they are nearly of the same width every where:\r\nwith regard to their surface they are sometimes very convex, as in\r\n_Moluris_; at others very flat, as in _Eurychora_, _Akis_, &c.\r\n\r\n6. _Appendages._ These, though not so remarkable as those of the\r\nhead and prothorax of beetles, ought not to be overlooked. In many\r\nCapricorns, as _Lamia Tribulus_, _speculifera_, &c., the disk and\r\nsides are armed with short sharp spines; in others (_Stenocorus_,\r\n&c.) the sutural and anal angles or one of them terminate in a spine\r\nor tooth; sometimes the whole surface, as in _Hispa atra_, &c., is\r\ncovered, like a porcupine, with a host of slender spines, or its\r\nsides defended by spinose lobes, as in _H. erinacea_: the humeral\r\nprominence is armed with a spine pointing to the head in _Macropus\r\nlongimanus_, and forming a right angle with the elytrum in some\r\n_Curculionidæ_, as _Rhynchites spinifex_; but the most remarkable\r\nappendage of this kind is exhibited by _Cassida bidens_ and its\r\naffinities,--from the centre of the sutures of the elytrum rise\r\nperpendicularly a pair of long, slender, sharp processes internally\r\nconcave, which both apply exactly to each other, so as together to\r\nform a single horn which rises, like a mast from a ship, from the\r\nbody of the animal[1806]. Besides the appendages here mentioned, the\r\nelytra exhibit a variety of tubercles and other elevations of various\r\nform and size, which it would be endless to particularize.\r\n\r\n7. _Sculpture._ The _sculpture_ of the organs in question is very\r\nvarious and often very ornamental: but as almost every kind of\r\nit will be noticed in the _orismological_ tables, it will not\r\nbe necessary to enlarge upon it here, especially since I have\r\nendeavoured upon a former occasion to explain how it may be useful\r\nand important as well as ornamental to the animal[1807]. I shall\r\ntherefore only notice a few instances, amongst many, in which a\r\nparticular kind of sculpture distinguishes particular tribes. Amongst\r\nthose that are Predaceous the _Cicindelidæ_ have elytra without\r\nstriæ or furrows, while the majority of the subsequent terrestrial\r\ntribes of this section are distinguished by them: the _Dynastidæ_ in\r\nthe Lamellicorn section are remarkable for a single crenated furrow\r\nnext the suture; in the weevil tribes the numerous species of the\r\ngenus _Apion_ are ornamented by furrowed elytra with pores in the\r\nfurrows, which give them the appearance of neat stitching; in many of\r\nthose beetles that have soft elytra, as the glow-worms (_Lampyris_),\r\nthe blister-beetles (_Cantharis_, _Mylabris_), and still more in\r\n_Œdemera_, two or three slight ridges generally run longitudinally\r\nfrom the base to the apex, and are visible also on the under-side;\r\nas the _furrows_ probably lighten a _hard_ elytrum, these ridges\r\nmay serve to strengthen a _soft_ one, and it is by these that the\r\nfirst approach is made to the reticular structure of _tegmina_ or the\r\nwing-covers of _Orthoptera_: _Lycus palliatus_, &c., in its elytra\r\nexhibits a direct resemblance of the reticulations of nervures.\r\n\r\n8. _Clothing._ To what I have before said on this subject in\r\ngeneral[1808] I shall here add a few remarks, which, though they\r\nmore properly belong to _elytra_, may in many cases be extended to\r\nthe whole body of a beetle. In various instances it happens that the\r\nbeautiful markings of these organs, as in _Macropus longimanus_,\r\nwhose elytra when denuded are black, are produced by short decumbent\r\nhairs; in some these variegations are the effect of scales resembling\r\nthose of _Lepidoptera_, often of a metallic lustre; from these\r\nscales is derived all the brilliancy of the diamond-beetle (_Entimus\r\nimperialis_, Germ.); in some the scales are so minute as to resemble\r\nthe pollen of flowers, as the white marks observable on the green\r\nelytra of the rose-chafer (_Cetonia aurata_).\r\n\r\n9. _Colour._ The organs of flight in the majority of the Orders\r\nwith respect to _colour_ are usually the most gaily decorated part\r\nof insects; I therefore deferred the notice of that subject till I\r\ncame to treat of them. In general the colour of insects is either\r\ninherent in the substance of their crust, or produced by the hairs\r\nor scales that either partially or totally cover it. To confine\r\nmyself to the _Coleoptera_, of whose elytra we are treating, it may\r\nbe observed, I think, in general, that the majority of those that\r\nfeed upon _putrescent_ substances, the _saprophagous_ tribes of Mr.\r\nW. S. MacLeay, are commonly of a more dark and dismal aspect and\r\ncolour than those which feed upon such as are living and fresh,\r\ndenominated _thalerophagous_ by the same learned author; this you may\r\nsee exemplified in his _Scarabæidæ_ and _Cetoniadæ_. Again, in the\r\nPredaceous beetles a similar contrast of colours is often observable.\r\nHow brilliant and gay are the fierce _Cicindelæ_! those tigers of\r\ninsects, as Linné calls them; how black as to colour, how horrible\r\nin aspect is their near relation the _Manticora_: what difference\r\nexists in the economy of these animals is not known, except, as I\r\nlearn from Mr. Burchell, that the latter is subterraneous, whereas\r\nthe former seek the sunbeam and fly rapidly. I shall now point out\r\na few instances in which the colours of their _elytra_ distinguish\r\ntribes or families. Amongst the Predaceous beetles a large family of\r\nthe _Cicindelidæ_ are distinguished by a middle angular white band,\r\nand several white dots on their green or brown elytra, as in _C.\r\nsylvatica_; a family of _Brachinus_, and the majority of _Mylabris_,\r\n_Lamia capensis_ and _fasciatus_, &c., by black elytra, with yellow\r\nor red bands; _Carabus violacea_ and affinities by the violet margin\r\nof these organs; _Calliochroma_ Latreille by their _sericeous_, and\r\n_Eumolpus_ by their _metallic_, lustre. These instances will be\r\nsufficient to turn your attention to this subject, which though not\r\nof _primary_ importance in discriminating genera &c., is not without\r\nits use in a _secondary_ view.\r\n\r\n10. _Uses._ I must not quit this subject without saying something\r\nupon the ends which elytra seem designed to serve. Their first and\r\nmost obvious use is the protection of the wings when unemployed, that\r\nthey may not be lacerated or soiled, and rendered unfit for flight in\r\nthe various retreats to which these animals betake themselves either\r\nfor food, repose, or to lay their eggs; to promote this purpose more\r\neffectually, the wings are usually curiously folded and laid up under\r\nthem; and where the elytra are very short, as in the _Staphylinidæ_,\r\nthese folds are very numerous and complex. In some instances,\r\nhowever, as in _Molorchus_ F., _Atractocerus_, &c., the wings are\r\nonly partially protected by the elytra and not folded under them;\r\nprobably they are less in danger of laceration from their peculiar\r\nhabits than the generality. Another use is to protect the upper-side\r\nof the alitrunk, which for reasons before assigned is usually softer\r\nthan the under-side, and also of the abdomen, often above nearly\r\nmembranous, from the injury to which they would otherwise be exposed;\r\nin the latter part also the spiracles in _Coleoptera_ are not covered\r\nby the inosculations of the segments, as is the case in most other\r\nOrders, and therefore probably require some covering when the insect\r\nis not flying. In the Apterous beetles this appears to be their\r\nprincipal use; where these organs are connate, or as it were soldered\r\ntogether, the back of the abdomen is a thin membrane; the appearance\r\nof _two_ elytra in these cases is given, doubtless, for the sake of\r\nsymmetry and beauty, a subordinate attention to which may be traced\r\nin all the works of creation. If we consider the bulk and weight of\r\nmany flying beetles, we may imagine that they want some assistance,\r\nmore than the extent and dimension of their wings seem to promise,\r\nto support them in the air, and to enable them to move more readily\r\nin it; and although it seems clear from the state of their muscular\r\napparatus that elytra do not move much in flight, yet by giving a\r\nbroad and concave surface to the air, for then they are usually\r\nnearly vertical, they may assist in some measure as sails, and help\r\nthem in flying traversely and before the wind[1809].\r\n\r\n\r\nii. _Tegmina_[1810]. By this name the learned Illiger has\r\ndistinguished the upper organs of flight of the _Orthoptera_ and\r\nHomopterous _Hemiptera_[1811]. They may be considered under the same\r\nheads nearly as elytra.\r\n\r\n1. _Substance._ _Tegmina_ differ very materially from _elytra_\r\nin their _substance_, being generally more or less diaphanous,\r\nthough in _Blatta Petiveriana_ the dark parts are as opaque as\r\nelytra, and those of the _Mantes_ that resemble dry leaves are only\r\nsemidiaphanous. These organs are also of a less dense substance\r\nthan elytra, something between coriaceous and membranous, which I\r\nshall express by the term _pergameneous_, as somewhat resembling\r\nparchment or vellum. Another circumstance relative to this head\r\nalso distinguishes them,--they are not lined with membrane. In some\r\ninstances, as in _B. Petiveriana_ just named, they approach nearly\r\nto the substance of elytra, and in _B. viridis_, some _Mantes_, and\r\n_Tettigonia_, &c., they are little different from wings in their\r\nsubstance; but this does not diminish their right to be considered as\r\n_tegmina_, since their structure is altogether the same.\r\n\r\n2. _Articulation with the trunk._ I observed above that the axis of\r\nelytra may be regarded as formed of _three_ parts, one appertaining\r\nto each of the areas or their representatives[1812]; in _tegmina_,\r\nand indeed in wings in general, these parts are separate and may\r\nbe more distinctly traced, the _axis_ of the _Costal_ Area being\r\ngenerally the longest, and that of the _Intermediate_ often the\r\nshortest; these _axes_ are suspended in the wing-socket by elastic\r\nligaments, intermixed with hard bony plates, the principal one of\r\nwhich, called by M. Chabrier the _humerus_[1813], is connected both\r\nwith the _tegmen_ and the trunk, and in some a little resembles the\r\nhead and neck of a swan. This structure permits the animal to move\r\nthe lateral areas in some degree separately, so that each, especially\r\nthe _anal_, shall form an angle with the intermediate; as the motion\r\nof the latter is not wanted, its _axis_ often falls short of the\r\nbase, or is obsolete, as in _Blatta_.\r\n\r\n3. _Composition._ The three areas, traces of which we had discovered\r\nin _elytra_, are particularly visible in _tegmina_. If you take any\r\ncockroach (_Blatta_), you will at first sight see that in it they are\r\ndivided into three larger portions by stronger nervures or folds;\r\nand if you also take a _Mantis_, or _Locusta_ Leach, a _Fulgora_ or\r\n_Tettigonia_, the same circumstance will strike you, only you will\r\nsee that in these the intermediate portion terminates also in an\r\naxis; these are what I call the three _areas_. The external one or\r\nCostal is usually the longest and narrowest[1814]; the Intermediate\r\none is commonly triangular, with its inner side curvilinear[1815];\r\nand the interior one, or _Anal_ area, in the _Orthoptera_ is rather\r\noblong; in _Fulgora_ angular, and in _Tettigonia_ it presents an\r\nisosceles triangle; with its vertex to the apex of the wing[1816].\r\nThe first of these may be defined as that portion of the wing that\r\nlies between the _costal_ and _postcostal_ nervures; and perhaps, in\r\nsome cases, as in _Mantis_, for there is the fold of the _tegmen_,\r\nthe _mediastinal_ may be regarded as its limit; the Intermediate\r\nArea is that which lies between the _postcostal_ or _mediastinal_\r\nnervure and the _anal_ fold of the wing; and the Anal Area is the\r\nremainder. These areas may perhaps best be made out by tracing each\r\nto its axis. To study them carefully in _tegmina_ and _hemelytra_ is\r\nof considerable importance; for in them we find the first outline of\r\nthe general plan upon which the wings of insects are constructed,\r\nand which, as we shall see hereafter, more or less enters into the\r\ncomposition of them all.\r\n\r\n4. _Position, and folding in repose._ With regard to their position\r\nwhen not expanded, _tegmina_ vary somewhat in the different tribes.\r\nIn the _Coleoptera_ we have seen that, except in a few instances,\r\nthe elytra unite at their suture. Something like this takes place in\r\n_Fulgora_, _Cercopis_ and affinities, in the Homopterous _Hemiptera_;\r\nin these, though the union is not near so exact, yet the _tegmina_ do\r\nnot lap over each other; they are usually more or less deflexed, with\r\nscarcely any portion in a horizontal position: in _Tettigonia_ F.,\r\n_Chermes_, _Aphis_, &c., the middle part only of these organs meets,\r\nfrom which point they diverge both towards their base and apex[1817].\r\nIn the _Orthoptera_ the position is quite different, for one tegmen\r\nmore or less lies over the other. In _Blatta_, in which the _tegmina_\r\nare nearly horizontal, the left hand one covers almost half the\r\nother[1818]: in the other tribes of the Order, with little variation,\r\nthe Anal Area of the _tegmen_ is horizontal, and covers the back of\r\nthe animal, and the Intermediate and Costal are vertical and cover\r\nits sides; the former, however, in some cases, only forms the angle\r\nbetween them. Sometimes in these the right-hand one is laid upon the\r\nleft, as in _Acheta_; and sometimes the reverse of this takes place,\r\nas in _Acrida_ K. With regard to the folding of the _tegmina_, the\r\nmost remarkable instance that occurs is that of _Acheta monstrosa_,\r\nin which the ends of both these organs and the wings, in repose, are\r\nfolded like a fan, and then rolled up like a serpent[1819].\r\n\r\n5. _Shape._ The shape of _tegmina_ is various. In the _Blattæ_\r\nand some _Mantes_ they are more or less _oblong_; in _Mantis\r\nprecaria_, _strumaria_[1820], and others, they incline to\r\n_elliptical_; in _Phasma grandis_ and _Acheta monstrosa_ they\r\nare rather _panduriform_[1821]; in _M. gongyloides_ they are\r\n_semi-cordate_[1822]; in _Pterophylla trapeziformis_ they are\r\n_rhomboidal_[1823]; in _Conocephalus erosus_ they are _sinuated_; in\r\n_Locusta_ Leach they are usually _linear_ or linear-oblong[1824]; in\r\n_Pterophylla_ K. they generally terminate in a short mucro[1825]; and\r\nin some of those _Mantidæ_ whose _tegmina_ simulate arid leaves, in a\r\nrecurved one[1826]. In the Homopterous _Hemiptera_ the shape of these\r\norgans is less various. In the _Fulgorellæ_ Latr. they incline to a\r\ntrapezium, sometimes to a pentagon[1827]; in the _Tettigoniæ_ F. they\r\napproach to an obtuse-angled triangle; and in others of the tribe\r\nthey are nearly wedge-shaped[1828].\r\n\r\n6. _Neuration._ The circumstance that most strikingly distinguishes\r\n_tegmina_ from _elytra_ is their _neuration_ or veining; which adds\r\nmuch to their strength, without increasing their weight so much as\r\nto render them unapt for flight. To look at these organs in _Blatta\r\nPetiveriana_, you would imagine them at first to be deprived of\r\nthis distinction; but if you observe them attentively, particularly\r\ntheir white spots, you will soon detect their nervures; and if\r\nyou further examine their lower surface, you will find them very\r\nvisible. The gibbous _Blattæ_ also, _Blatta picta_ and affinities,\r\nthe analogues of _Erotylus_ amongst the _Coleoptera_, have _tegmina_\r\nwhich, except at their apex, exhibit but faint traces of the nervures\r\nof their tribe, and approach to elytra besides by the innumerable\r\nminute impressed points that cover them. In the _Orthoptera_ and\r\nsome Homopterous _Hemiptera_ the nervures may be divided into\r\n_longitudinal_ ones more or less ramified, and _traversing_ ones.\r\nIn the _Blattæ_ the traversing nervures cut the longitudinal ones\r\nnearly at right angles, but not at regular intervals, so as to cover\r\nthe tegmen with quadrangular areolets; in _Mantis precaria_ and\r\naffinities the longitudinal nervures of the Anal Area diverge from\r\nthe base, and are traversed nearly as in _Blatta_, while those of\r\nthe Costal diverge from the mediastinal nervure, but the traversing\r\nones form innumerable irregular reticulations; in _Mantis sinuata_\r\nK.[1829] the whole tegmen has such reticulations but less numerous;\r\nin _Locusta_ Leach it is regularly reticulated at the base, but the\r\nareolets of the apex are quadrangular; in the _Mantes_, with oblong\r\nwings, all are quadrangular; in _Pterophylla_ K. the longitudinal\r\ndiverging nervures are not numerous, and the traversing ones cut\r\nthem into quadrangular and triangular areolets, besides which they\r\nare covered by innumerable impressed points, so as altogether to\r\nexhibit a most exact resemblance of the leaf of some evergreen: in\r\n_Gryllotalpa_ the longitudinal nervures of the Anal Area rather\r\nconverge towards the apex, are traversed by few transverse nervures,\r\nand those of the Costal Area which diverge from the mediastinal\r\nnervure by still fewer; the neuration of _Acheta_ F. has been before\r\ndescribed[1830]; I shall only observe here, that the constructors of\r\n_stringed_ instruments of music might, perhaps, from the _tegmina_\r\nof the male, the nervures of which probably modulate the sounds\r\nwhich it produces, take a hint for giving the strings in them a\r\nserpentine or convolute direction, and so might produce something new\r\nin that department, corresponding with the serpents and French-horns\r\nin _wind_ instruments. Of the Homopterous _Hemiptera_ in the\r\n_Fulgorellæ_ Latr., which are most analogous to the _Orthoptera_\r\nof all that tribe, the longitudinal nervures are more numerous and\r\nbranching, more especially toward the apex of the _tegmen_, and are\r\ntraversed as much by transverse ones, sometimes reticulating the wing\r\nwith roundish areolets, as in _F. laternaria_, and at others with\r\nquadrangular ones, as in _F. candelaria_; in some of these however,\r\nas _Otiocerus_ K., _Flata_ F., &c.[1831], there are no traversing\r\nnervures; and these lead to the _Cercopidæ_ and others in which the\r\nlongitudinal nervures become few, and some are without any[1832],\r\nand these terminate those of this section of the Order in which the\r\nnervures in question are continued to the margin of the wing. We next\r\ncome to those, _Darnis_, _Centrotus_, _Membracis_, &c., in which they\r\nare circumscribed a little within the apex by a traversing nervure,\r\nso that the tegmen ends in a margin of pure membrane, and thus some\r\napproach seems to be made to the _Hemelytra_, from _Tettigonia_, the\r\nmost conspicuous genus of this tribe, in which the _areolets_, few\r\nin number, like those of _Lepidoptera_, are not formed, except the\r\nterminal ones, by traversing nervures, but by the ramifications of\r\nthe longitudinal ones; in _Chermes_ the Intermediate Area, which is\r\nconnected with the base of the wing by a single nervure, is the only\r\npart that has any areolets[1833].\r\n\r\n7. _Colour._ Orthopterous insects are seldom remarkable for _tegmina_\r\nof brilliant _colours_; there is in them none of that gilding or\r\nmetallic lustre which so often distinguishes elytra: they are also\r\nfrequently less ornamented in this respect than the wings, with which\r\nthey usually form an agreeable contrast. Their reticulations and\r\nnervures, which are sometimes of a different colour from the rest of\r\nthe tegmen, decorate them considerably: a remarkable circumstance\r\nbelonging to this head attends the black tegmina of _Blatta\r\nPetiveriana_; one has _four_ white spots, and the other only _three_;\r\nbut as one laps over the other, the symmetry of the arrangement is\r\npreserved: the Homopterous _Hemiptera_ are more distinguished in\r\nthis respect, and some of the _Fulgoridæ_ imitate the _Lepidoptera_\r\nboth by their ocelli and spots: _Fulgora laternaria_, _Candelaria_,\r\n_serrata_, and _Diadema_, sufficiently exemplify this remark, as do\r\nseveral _Flatæ_ likewise[1834].\r\n\r\nWe may observe here--that _tegmina_ are more calculated for flight\r\nthan _elytra_, both from their thinner substance, and from the angle\r\nthat their Anal Area, and often the Costal, forms with the rest of\r\nthe _tegmen_; a circumstance which, in wings, M. Chabrier thinks\r\npresents some facilities in that kind of motion.\r\n\r\n\r\niii. _Hemelytra_[1835]. The next species of wing-covers, which\r\nthough varying in the substance of their base, terminate in a part\r\ndistinct from the three areas, consisting in almost every case of\r\nmere membrane, peculiar to the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_, are called\r\n_hemelytra_, or half-elytra:--this term was also formerly employed,\r\nbut certainly incorrectly, to denote _tegmina_. I shall consider them\r\nwith respect to such of the particulars noticed under the former\r\nheads as apply to them, but without repeating them formally.\r\n\r\n1. As to their _substance_, they must be separately considered with\r\nregard to their base and apex. In various instances the _base_,\r\nor part consisting of the three areas, is almost corneous, as\r\nin _Cydnus Morio_ and _bicolor_, bugs not uncommon with us, and\r\nmany others[1836]; in these cases it is lined with a _hypoderma_\r\nlike elytra; and in many the points, which are impressed upon it,\r\nalso perforate the _hemelytrum_, and seem to act as pores: but in\r\n_Lygæus_, _Reduvius_, _Capsus_, _Miris_, and the majority of the\r\nHeteropterous _Hemiptera_, the organs in question being soft and\r\nflexible, may be stated as rather resembling leather than horn;--on\r\nthis account this part of a _hemelytrum_ is denominated the _corium_.\r\nIn _Scutellera_ the portion covered by the scutellum is membranous;\r\nand in _Acanthia paradoxa_, and the cucullated species of _Tingis_,\r\nthe wing-covers are entirely so. The apex of these organs is almost\r\nuniversally either membranous or coriaceo-membranous, on which\r\naccount it is called the _membrana_. I say _almost_, because in\r\n_Aradus_ and the _Hydrocorisæ_ Latr., this part, though rather\r\nthinner than the rest of the _Hemelytrum_, is also coriaceous; in\r\nthe latter tribe usually with a very narrow membranous edge; and in\r\nmany _Reduvii_ and _Zeli_ there is scarcely any difference in the\r\nsubstance of the base and apex.\r\n\r\n2. As to the _articulation_ of _Hemelytra_ with the trunk, it seems\r\nnot strikingly different from that of _tegmina_: the point or base\r\nof the Intermediate Area, which falls short of that of the lateral\r\nareas, seems connected by a slender ligamentous piece, with its axis,\r\nwhich is thick; and I do not discern Chabrier's _humerus_ shaped like\r\na swan's head and neck[1837].\r\n\r\n3. The _composition_ of these organs differs from that of _tegmina_\r\nin more respects than one: in the first place, they consist, as\r\nwas lately observed, of _four_ instead of _three_ areas; in the\r\nnext, they appear to have, at least several of them, a part, which\r\nI suspect to be analogous to that above described in _Coleoptera_,\r\nsupposed to represent the _phialum_ of wings[1838]. I shall first\r\nspeak of the _areas_. In some apterous species related to the\r\nbed-bug, _Lygæus brevicollis_ Latr.[1839], &c., there is no trace\r\nof the usual areas, and the _membrana_ is a very narrow strip; in\r\n_L. apterus_ the former are very faintly traced out, but they are\r\npresent in all those that are furnished with wings; whence we may\r\nconjecture that they are of the same importance in flight with the\r\nfolds observable in those organs[1840]. The three basal areas may be\r\nsaid most commonly to present three isosceles triangles, the Costal\r\none being narrow and curvilinear[1841], the Intermediate the most\r\nample[1842], and the Anal one the narrowest and shortest[1843], with\r\nits vertex towards the apex of the _Hemelytrum_, while in the two\r\nformer it is at its base. In _Lygæus compressipes_ (_Rhinuchus_ K.\r\nMS.) the Anal Area is cultriform; and in most of the _Hydrocorisæ_ it\r\nhas an angle in the middle of its posterior margin. The proportion\r\nthat the _membrana_ or _apical area_ bears to the rest of the wing\r\nvaries in the different tribes. In some, as before stated, it is\r\nobsolete, in others nearly so; in the majority, perhaps, it occupies\r\nabout a _third_ of the _hemelytrum_; in _Lygæus compressipes_,\r\n_cruciatus_, &c., full _half_; in _Alydus calcaratus_, _two-thirds_;\r\nin _Reduvius_, nearly _three-quarters_[1844]; and in _Aradus\r\ndepressus_ the corium,--divided, however, though indistinctly, into\r\nthe three areas,--is driven to the _base_ of the wing: two ends are\r\nanswered by this structure--as this insect lives under bark, its\r\nthin _hemelytra_ take less room; and as it flies, though it has only\r\nrudiments of wings, they are more fit to supply their place: the part\r\nwe are speaking of usually runs obliquely from the vertex of the\r\nAnal Area to the base of the Costal.\r\n\r\n4. As to their _position and folding in repose_, _Hemelytra_ are\r\nusually nearly or altogether _horizontal_; but in _Notonecta_ and\r\n_Plea_ they are _deflexed_ and cover the sides of the body; and the\r\napical area of one wing precisely covers that of the other; where\r\nthe scutellum does not intervene, as in _Scutellera_, _Pentatoma_,\r\n&c., the vertical angles of the Anal Area meet in the middle of the\r\nback, so as to exhibit the appearance of a cross. In _Notonecta_, in\r\nwhich the _hemelytra_ are deflexed, at the apex of the _membrana_\r\nis a fissure which permits the two sides to form an angle with each\r\nother, and to apply exactly to the body. In _Plea_, in which there\r\nis no apical area, the posterior margins of the _tegmina_, as they\r\nought rather to be termed, unite, but do not lap over each other.\r\nWith regard to the appearance of something like a _phialum_, if you\r\nexamine the _hemelytra_ of most species of bugs on the underside, you\r\nwill see that the costal nervure at the base is inflexed and covers a\r\nkind of channel; if you next take one of _Belostoma grandis_, where\r\nthe structure is most conspicuous, or even the common _Nepa cinerea_,\r\nyou will find in the same situation, adjacent to the inflexed costal\r\nnervure, a hollow tube running from the base of the wing, and\r\nterminating, after proceeding about one-fourth of its length, in a\r\nhollow cavity, which, as it is covered by a membrane, appears to me\r\nto be a collapsed pouch. This circumstance is worthy of further and\r\nmore general investigation.\r\n\r\n5. In their _shape_, with few exceptions, _hemelytra_ more or less\r\nrepresent a wedge, being wider at their apex, where they are usually\r\nobliquely truncated, than at the base; but in _Plea_ Leach they are\r\nobtusangular, with the angle in the sutural margin; in _Notonecta_,\r\non the contrary, an obtusangular sinus distinguishes that part; in\r\n_Naucoris_ they are curvilinear and every where of equal width;\r\nin _Ranatra_ they are linear and straight; in _Aradus_ they are\r\noblong, usually with an external lobe or dilatation at their base:\r\na remarkable instance of the intention of this is observable in a\r\nnondescript Brazilian species, in which the head, prothorax, and\r\nabdomen, are edged with a number of broad foliaceous appendages; if\r\nthe base of the _hemelytrum_ had not been furnished with a similar\r\nappendage, the symmetry of the whole body would have been destroyed\r\nby the hiatus between the prothorax and abdomen, as may be seen by\r\nremoving the _hemelytra_; but by this compensating contrivance of\r\nProvidence, the gap is filled, the above lobe fitting exactly into it.\r\n\r\n6. The _neuration_ of these organs will not occupy us long, since\r\nthe _corium_ or harder part, though in some species there are traces\r\nof nervures, is often without them. Those of the cucullated species\r\nof _Tingis_ resemble many _tegmina_ in being ornamented by them with\r\na kind of network, which looks like the finest lace; in several\r\n_Lygæi_, _Edessa_, and some _Reduvii_, there are a few diverging\r\nlongitudinal nervures which occasionally by a ramification here and\r\nthere form an areolet[1845], but there are seldom any traversing\r\nnervures. The Apical Area is usually most distinguished by nervures,\r\nin some forming several areolets, as in _Aradus_, in others running\r\nparallel to each other, nearly to the end of this area, as in\r\n_Belostoma grandis_, where they are met by a traversing nervure; the\r\nobject of this is doubtless to strengthen the membrane.\r\n\r\n7. Both _tegmina_ and _hemelytra_ are most commonly naked, yet very\r\nshort _hairs_ are found on those of some species of _Cercopis_, and\r\nin many more instances in those of the latter description, as in\r\n_Notonecta_, several _Lygæi_ and _Reduvii_, &c.\r\n\r\n8. _Colours_ in _hemelytra_ are very various, and in many instances\r\nare peculiar to families; in certain _Lygæi_ (_L. Hyoscyami_, &c.)\r\nblack and red; in _Lygæus compressipes_ and affinities a dingy black;\r\nin some _Reduvii_ black with a large white spot;--but it is needless\r\nto enlarge further on this subject.\r\n\r\n9. That _hemelytra_ are used in flight is evident not only from\r\nthe large space allowed for their muscles[1846], but likewise from\r\na circumstance noticed by M. Chabrier, that in flight, in the\r\n_Pentatomæ_ Latr., the corium of the _hemelytrum_ is fixed to the\r\nwing[1846]; in which case both must describe the same arc.\r\n\r\n\r\niv. _Wings._ We are next to consider organs which are exclusively\r\nappropriated to _flight_, and therefore are properly denominated\r\n_wings_. These in the Orders that have _elytra_, _tegmina_, or\r\n_hemelytra_, are the pair that correspond with the secondary wings of\r\nthe other Orders. It may be said, indeed, that in several instances\r\nboth _tegmina_ and _hemelytra_ do not differ at all in substance\r\nor use from the wings that they cover. This is true; but as their\r\nstructure in other respects is the same with that of those that are\r\nmore solid and less apt for flight, it was convenient to consider\r\nthem under the same name.\r\n\r\n1. To begin with the _articulation of these organs with the trunk_; in\r\ngeneral it may be stated that this, as in _tegmina_ and _hemelytra_,\r\nis usually by the intervention of three axes, formed by the conflux\r\nof the nervures of the three areas at the base of the wing, which\r\neither immediately or by other pieces are implanted in the trunk, so\r\nas to receive from it the aërial and other fluids, necessary for its\r\nexpansion and motions[1847]. Having given this general statement, I\r\nshall next apply it to the wings in some of the different Orders. If\r\nyou carefully extract one from the stag-beetle (_Lucanus Cervus_)\r\nor any large species of the _Dynastidæ_, in the _Coleoptera_; the\r\nfirst thing that will strike you, upon examining the base, will be\r\nthe plate before mentioned called by Chabrier the _humerus_, which\r\nis a stout transverse corneous piece, with a deep sinus towards\r\nthe wing, filled with ligament: if you again follow the costal,\r\nmediastinal, and postcostal nervures, you will find them unite to\r\nform an axis, consisting of three parallel pieces, which connects\r\nby its intermediate internal piece with one end of this plate. The\r\nnervures of the Intermediate Area terminate also in a corneous axis at\r\na greater distance from the base than the other two, which connects\r\nwith Chabrier's _humerus_ by means of the ligament of the sinus just\r\nnamed. Those of the Anal Area are received by a ligament attached to\r\na transverse plate, widest at its anterior end, which connects with\r\nthe posterior part of the said _humerus_; and at its posterior end is\r\nunited to the _postfrænum_[1848], with which it forms a right angle.\r\nIn the _Orthoptera_ Order the structure is not very different, but the\r\naxes and other plates of the base of the wing are less distinct and\r\nrather cartilaginous; the nervures of the Anal Area often terminate\r\nin a transverse one that there forms the segment of a circle[1849];\r\nthe inner base of this circle is ligament connected with the\r\n_postfrænum_[1850]. In the Homopterous _Hemiptera_ the three axes may\r\nbe readily traced, but the _humeral_ plate, with which they all are\r\nconnected, is more irregular in shape, and in _Fulgora_ longitudinal,\r\nwith an angular surface; in this Order the nervure, in some cases\r\nconsisting of cartilaginous rings[1851], in which the _frænum_ and\r\n_postfrænum_ terminate in the _tegmina_ and wings, is attached\r\nposteriorly to the ligament of the Anal Area. In the Heteropterous\r\nsection the three axes are evident, but the _humeral_ plate is not\r\neasily made out. In the _Libellulina_ the axes of the Costal and\r\nIntermediate Areas are the coloured broad plates at their base, formed\r\nby the dilatation of their nervures; that, however, of the Anal is not\r\ndilated, but forms one nervure, in the primary wing, with the _frænum_,\r\nand in the secondary with the _postfrænum_. Having given you this clue\r\nto trace the axes in those tribes in which they are most conspicuous,\r\nit will assist you in searching for them in the remaining Orders,\r\nin all of which they may be traced, except perhaps in those minute\r\n_Hymenoptera_ whose wings have solely the costal nervures; probably in\r\nthese there is only _one_ axis. In the _Lepidoptera_ and _Hymenoptera_\r\na circumstance connected with the present head is observable, which is\r\nnot to be discovered in the other Orders: these are the _tegulæ_ or\r\nbase-covers, which appear intended to defend the base of the anterior\r\nwings. They are concavo-convex scales, which in the _Lepidoptera_ are\r\nlarge and of an irregular shape[1852], but in the _Hymenoptera_ are\r\nsmaller and semicircular[1853].\r\n\r\n2. Wings, with regard to their _substance_, may generally be termed\r\n_membranous_; but they vary in this respect, some being much thicker\r\nthan others, either _partially_ or _totally_: in spotted wings,\r\nas in those of many _Libellulina_, _Tettigoniæ_ F., &c., the dark\r\nopaque parts are denser than those that are transparent: in several\r\n_Orthopterous_ insects, as in _Phasma_, some _Mantes_, &c., the\r\nCostal Area or covering part of the wing is of a substance equally\r\nfirm with that of the _tegmen_. This is a compensating contrivance,\r\nthat where the latter is shorter and smaller than the former,\r\nits membranous part, when folded, may be protected from injury.\r\nAnother similar contrivance of DIVINE WISDOM is exhibited by those\r\n_Pterophyllæ_ K. (_Locusta_ F.) whose _tegmina_ resemble the leaves\r\nof plants (_Pt. laurifolia_, &c.); in these the tip of the wings when\r\nfolded being longer, is not covered by the _tegmina_, and therefore\r\nexposed to injury; to prevent which this small piece, while the\r\nwhole wing, as far as covered by those organs, is membranous, is of\r\nthe same substance with them[1854]. The wings of most _Coleoptera_,\r\n_Orthoptera_, _Hemiptera_, and _Thereva coleoptrata_, in the\r\n_Diptera_, &c., are of a firmer substance than those of the other\r\nOrders; in many _Locustæ_ Leach, _Fulgoræ_, &c., they are nearly as\r\nfirm as the _tegmina_; and in _Ascalaphus italicus_, except at their\r\nbase, the _secondary_ wings are less membranous than the _primary_.\r\nM. Chabrier has observed[1855] that the wings of insects in general\r\ndiminish in thickness from their base to their apex, and from their\r\nanterior to their posterior margin.\r\n\r\n3. I should have had, it is probable, but little original matter\r\nto communicate under the head of the _composition_ and _neuration_\r\nof wings, had M. Jurine, who has written so ably on those of\r\n_Hymenoptera_, undertaken a survey of the organs of flight in every\r\nOrder of insects: but as his views were confined to only _two_ of\r\nthe Linnean Orders, it is not wonderful that his system and set\r\nof terms should fail where a generalization is necessary; and I\r\nmay stand acquitted of presumption and conceit if I attempt to\r\nsubstitute a system and body of terms more universally applicable.\r\nHad the plan of this able Entomologist led him to pay attention to\r\n_tegmina_ and _hemelytra_, their division into three longitudinal\r\nareas would have immediately struck him; and having acquired this\r\noutline of the greater natural divisions, he would have applied it\r\nto the Orders that have _wings_ only, and having discovered that it\r\nis to be traced in all, the result would have probably superseded\r\nmy labors. Had his life been longer spared, perhaps something of\r\nthis kind would have been effected by him; but as he, alas! is gone,\r\nand no abler hand seems to have undertaken the task, I will do what\r\nI can to give you satisfaction on this subject[1856]. You have\r\nalready got a tolerably good idea of these areas from what has been\r\nsaid upon the subject under _tegmina_ and _hemelytra_; but I shall\r\nnow more particularly state to you how they are circumstanced in\r\n_wings_. I shall first explain the general law as to their limits.\r\nThe _Costal Area_[1857] is all that longitudinal portion of the wing\r\nthat lies between the anterior margin and the postcostal nervure;\r\nthe _Intermediate Area_[1858] is all that longitudinal portion of\r\nthe wing that lies between the postcostal and the anal nervures;\r\nand the _Anal Area_[1859] is all that longitudinal portion of the\r\nwing that lies between the anal nervure and the posterior margin.\r\nBut there are other helps to enable you to distinguish the areas\r\nin the different Orders. The Anal Area in all Orders forms the\r\nposterior _fold_ of the wing; in _Coleoptera_ turned under when in\r\nrepose; in _Orthoptera_ folded like a fan; in _Lepidoptera_, in some\r\n_Papilionidæ_, forming an arch over the abdomen. Again, in _Blatta_,\r\nthe Costal Area is distinguished chiefly by _longitudinal_ nervures;\r\nthe Intermediate by _oblique_ ones; and the Anal by _radiating_ ones;\r\nand in both this tribe and the _Mantidæ_ this last Area is marked\r\nout from the Intermediate by a marginal notch, which is not present\r\nin _Phasma_, but is found in both sections of the _Hemiptera_. In\r\n_Locusta_ Leach the notch is between the Costal and Intermediate\r\nAreas: in _Phasma_ the nervures of the Intermediate Area are branches\r\nof the externo-medial, while those of the Anal, as they do in all\r\nthe _Orthoptera_, diverge from the base of the wing: in many, as\r\nin _Pterophylla_ K., the part of the wing lately alluded to, that\r\nis longer than the _tegmen_, and of the same substance, points out\r\nthe limit of the Costal Area; and in others this part terminates\r\nin a segment of a circle and is differently reticulated at the\r\napex from the Intermediate: in the Homopterous _Hemiptera_ and the\r\n_Libellulina_, in which the areas at first seem indistinct, they\r\nmay generally be easily traced by following them from the axes. The\r\nseparation of the Costal from the Intermediate in the remaining\r\nOrders seems less easy on account of the branching of the nervures:\r\nin the rest of the _Neuroptera_ and the _Lepidoptera_, if the\r\nposterior branches of the postcostal nervure are not included, you\r\nwill have a narrow Postcostal Area, which in most cases forms an\r\nangle more or less prominent, in _Corydalis_ almost a right angle,\r\nwith the Intermediate: in _Hemerobius_ and affinities this part is\r\ndistinguished by areolets formed by _transverse_ nervures, while\r\nthose of the rest of the wing are _longitudinal_[1860]: but if the\r\nposterior branches are included, the Costal Area will be more ample:\r\na similar observation applies to the _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_;\r\nin these, in all cases, the areolets adjoining the anterior margin,\r\nwhich follow the _stigma_, should be regarded as belonging to the\r\nArea in question[1861]. In those tribes of the former Order, whose\r\nwings are without _nervures_, the areas are often marked by _folds_.\r\n\r\nM. Chabrier has observed that in _Coleoptera_ the specific weight of\r\nthe margin of the wing, and its means of resistance, are augmented\r\nby a liquid which is introduced, at the will of the animal, into\r\na long pocket under the _brachial_, here called the _costal_ and\r\n_mediastinal_ nervures, covered by a supple membrane, which in a\r\nstate of repose becomes flaccid[1862]: it is easily detected, being\r\nof a paler colour than the nervures between which it lies; this is\r\nwhat I call the _Phialum_; we have before seen that it exists also in\r\n_Elytra_ and some _Hemelytra_[1863]; but I have not detected it in\r\nany other _wings_.\r\n\r\nI have before given you a sufficiently full account of the _alulæ_\r\nor winglets of _Diptera_[1864]; and shall here only observe that\r\nthey are not confined to _one_ particular tribe, as has been usually\r\nimagined; but though sometimes extremely minute, simple, and not\r\neasily detected, are an _universal_ distinction of the Order.\r\n\r\nHaving thus endeavoured to elucidate the _larger_ Areas into\r\nwhich wings appear to be divided; I shall next say something on\r\nthe _smaller_ ones produced by the intersection or ramification\r\nof the nervures; these had been named areolets (_areolæ_) several\r\nyears before M. Jurine's work, in which he calls them, I think\r\n_improperly_, cellules (_cellulæ_), was published; I therefore\r\nretain the _prior_ term. The general structure of the nervures of\r\nthe wings of insects having been before explained[1865], I shall not\r\nhere repeat what I then said; but there is a curious circumstance\r\nconnected with it, particularly visible in the wings of certain\r\n_Hymenoptera_, that I must not pass without notice. If you examine\r\nattentively with a microscope against the light the wing of any\r\n_Nomada_ or _Andrena_, you will discover little transparent points\r\nin some of the smaller transverse nervures that form the middle\r\nareolets, in which the nervure becomes white and looks as if it\r\nwas interrupted, though in substance it seems continued: these\r\nlittle points, somewhat resembling minute air bubbles detained in\r\nthe tubes, are what M. Jurine, who first discovered them, has, on\r\nthat account, named _bullæ_, which he thus further describes:--\"When\r\nthe tube (of the nervure) arrives at the spot where a _bulla_ is to\r\nbe formed, it extends itself on all sides in minute threads in the\r\nupper membrane of the wing, losing its colour and tubular structure,\r\nwhich it resumes immediately after the formation of the bulla[1866].\"\r\nBut if you look closely at them you will find that there is always\r\na slight _fold_ of the wing that cuts the nervure exactly at the\r\n_bullæ_, and if the fold changes its direction they accompany it;\r\ntheir object, therefore, is clearly to relax the tension so as to\r\nadmit a little motion where the fold is; consequently, rather than\r\n_bullæ_ (bubbles), they should be denominated _articulations_. A\r\nsimilar construction, but on a larger scale, may be observed in the\r\nwings of _Coleoptera_[1867] and some others, as _Psocus_, where the\r\nfolds traverse the nervures. I shall next make a few observations\r\non the principal nervures; and first a word upon their _names_. M.\r\nJurine, being of opinion that a striking analogy exists between the\r\nwings of _insects_ and those of _birds_, in which M. Chabrier seems\r\nto agree with him, has named the nervures in the anterior margin of\r\nthe wings of the former, _radius_ and _cubitus_, as corresponding\r\nwith the bones so named in the fore-arm of the latter, and the plate\r\nwhich often terminates these nervures in _Hymenoptera_, he names\r\nthe _carpus_; it may look like presumption to differ from two such\r\nweighty authorities, but as their observations seem to have been\r\ntoo limited, in one case to the _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_ only;\r\nand in various Orders there is nothing analogous to the _stigma_ or\r\n_carpus_, and all the other nervures of an insect's wing have no\r\nanalogue in that of a bird, but more especially as M. Latreille seems\r\nto think with me on this subject[1868], I have retained Linné's term\r\nfor the marginal nervure, and for most of the others have adopted\r\nthose of the great French Entomologist just mentioned. I shall here\r\nonly further observe,--and it seems to me an observation of prime\r\nimportance, in the determination of the question of the analogy of\r\nthe wings of insects,--that they are not, as in birds, the _fore-leg_\r\nconverted into an organ of flight, but, like the wing of the _Draco_,\r\nan organ _superadded_ to the legs; and, further, that the connection\r\nis not with the fore-legs, but, as has been before observed[1869],\r\nwith the two posterior pairs.\r\n\r\nThe _Costa_[1870] is usually the strongest of the nervures, and\r\nthat upon which the wing seems to be built; but in some cases, as\r\nin _Blatta_, _Scutellera_, _Cynips_, &c., it is represented by\r\nthe mere membrane of the anterior margin; in some _Coleoptera_,\r\nas in _Geotrupes_, _Dytiscus_, &c., its structure, except at the\r\nbase, appears to be annular or nearly so, at least a vast number\r\nof corrugations, running transversely, are observable on its upper\r\nand lower surfaces; it is thus capable of greater tension and\r\nrelaxation, and more flexile. The _stigma_ or _carpus_[1871], though\r\nmost conspicuous in the _Hymenoptera_ Order, may be traced in some\r\n_Coleoptera_, Heteropterous _Hemiptera_, the _Libellulina_, &c.;\r\nbut it has no representative in the _Orthoptera_, _Lepidoptera_,\r\n_Trichoptera_, &c. The _mediastinal_ is usually a very slender\r\nnervure, placed between the _costa_ and _postcosta_, sometimes\r\nterminating in the former[1872], and at others in the latter[1873]: in\r\nthe _Orthoptera_, _Lepidoptera_, &c., however, and some others, it is\r\na very conspicuous and principal one[1873]; in the _Hymenoptera_ it\r\nis obsolete, merging in those nervures[1874]. The _Postcosta_ is the\r\nprincipal nervure of the wing in _Scutellera_, but in _Staphylinus_\r\nit is wanting; in _Chalcis sispes_ it is the only true nervure of\r\nthat organ, the others being represented by spurious ones[1875]. The\r\n_externomedial_ and _internomedial_ are sometimes distinct at their\r\norigin, but more frequently are branches from a common stem.\r\n\r\nHaving made these _general_ remarks, I shall now consider\r\n_particularly_ the _neuration_ of the wings in the different Orders,\r\nbeginning with the _Coleoptera_. The first thing that strikes the\r\nphysiologist in surveying a wing belonging to an insect of this\r\nOrder, is the general arrangement of the nervures[1876]; which are\r\nso placed that the required degree of tension may be given to every\r\npart of this organ: thus some are nearly straight[1877]; others\r\nrun in a serpentine direction[1878]; others are forked with one\r\nbranch recurrent and another proceeding onwards[1879]; others again\r\nare insulated, or do not originate from the base of the wing, or\r\nfrom other nervures, but are merely placed to strengthen an open\r\nspace of it[1880]: these nervures are also usually broader and more\r\nsubstantial than those of the wings of the subsequent Orders. Another\r\nstriking circumstance with regard to them is that the nervures form\r\nfew or no closed areolets, except in the Costal Area, where they\r\nare inconspicuous; in _Dytiscus marginalis_, indeed, and _Tenebrio\r\nMolitor_ one or two may be found, but in general there are none. In\r\nmany of this tribe the _postcosta_, which terminates at the joint\r\nof the wing, becomes recurrent, so as to form a hook, which perhaps\r\nrepresents the _stigma_, as in _Dynastes_[1881]; in _Creophilus_\r\nK., a rove-beetle, there is no hook but a broad plate adjacent to\r\nthe _costa_. In the _Strepsiptera_ Order the neuration is extremely\r\nsimple, the nervures, except one insulated one, diverging from the\r\nbase of the wing[1882]: in this respect, as well as in the form\r\nof that organ, an approach is made to the _Orthoptera_. In the\r\n_Dermaptera_ this approach is still more evident; in the common\r\nearwig[1883], the diverging nervures become numerous; between each is\r\nan insulated one, taking its origin in the middle of the wing, and\r\nrunning to the margin; a little nearer to the latter all the nervures\r\nare dilated into a plate; those of the anal area are angular[1884],\r\nand the exposed part of the costal is as hard as the elytra. The\r\nneuration in the _Orthoptera_ Order may be called _radiate_, the\r\nlongitudinal nervures for the most part diverging from the base of\r\nthe wing like _rays_: in some few instances[1885], but not often, I\r\nbelieve, an insulated nervure intervenes between each; traversing\r\nor connecting nervures, cutting the longitudinal ones in various\r\ndirections, ornament these wings with an infinity of areolets,\r\ncausing them to resemble fine gauze or beautiful lace or net-work;\r\nvery often these areolets are quadrangular, sometimes rhomboidal,\r\nfrequently nearly circular, and differing occasionally, as has been\r\nbefore observed[1886], in the different areas: it sometimes occurs\r\nthat there are no traversing nervures[1887], when the wing of course\r\nis without areolets. In the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_ the type of\r\nneuration, as to the wing, seems borrowed from the _Coleoptera_, a\r\nfurther proof that these are the analogues of that Order amongst\r\nthe _Haustellata_ Clairv. In these the nervures usually are few and\r\ndispersed, and seldom form any closed areolets. If you examine any\r\n_Scutellera_, _Pentatoma_, or _Lygæus_, you may trace the uncinated,\r\nforked, serpentine, and insulated nervures of Coleopterous insects;\r\nin _Gerris_ and _Velia_ there is an approach to the neuration of\r\nsome _Homopterous_ species, and in _Belostoma_ &c. the wing is\r\nreticulated by _spurious_ nervures. In the Homopterous section\r\nthere are several types of neuration; thus the _Fulgoræ_ resemble\r\nthe _Orthoptera_ in this respect; while the _Tettigoniæ_ F., &c.,\r\napproach nearer to the _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_, and have their\r\napical areolets circumscribed _within_ the margin by a traversing\r\nnervure; in _Flata_, &c., the areolets are mostly formed, not by\r\ntraversing nervures, but by the branching of the longitudinal ones;\r\nin this respect they are not unlike the _Lepidoptera_. In this\r\nlast-named Order there are some variations with regard to their\r\nneuration--thus, amongst the _butterflies_ in _Urania_, &c., there is\r\nno closed areolet in any of the wings, and almost all the nervures\r\ndiverge from the base[1888]; in _Morpho_, &c., there is only one in\r\nthe primary wing[1889]; in _Heliconia_, &c., there is one in both\r\nwings; amongst the _moths_, in the _Bombyces_ L., this is divided\r\ninto _two_, and in _Cossus labyrinthicus_ Don. into _three_ areolets:\r\nin some butterflies (_Lycæna_) there is one insulated nervure[1890],\r\nand in others (_Hesperia_) there are two[1891]; in these two last,\r\nand _Heliconia_, _Urania_, &c., the end of the Costal Area is\r\ndivided into several areolets by oblique nervures[1892], which\r\ngives them some analogy to the wings of many _Neuroptera_; and at\r\nthe base of this Area, in _Morpho_, is a roundish areolet[1893]. In\r\nthis Order the externo-medial and interno-medial nervures coalesce\r\ninto one, and are only represented separately by their first and\r\nthird branches[1894]. In the _Neuroptera_ Order the general type\r\nof neuration is borrowed from the _Orthoptera_; but in _Osmylus_,\r\n_Termes_, &c., there is an approach to that of _Flata_ in the\r\nHomopterous _Hemiptera_, and in _Psocus_ to others of that section;\r\nin the second of these genera the nervures, except those of the\r\ncostal margin, are spurious.\r\n\r\nI now come to the Order in which M. Jurine has laboured with so\r\nmuch success, I mean the _Hymenoptera_; and I only regret that his\r\nlabours were directed to so small a portion of the Class _Insecta_,\r\nand in that portion only to a part of the upper wing; I say only\r\na _part_, because all those areolets of the posterior part of the\r\nwing, in some cases amounting to _five_[1895], that lie behind his\r\n_cubital cellules_, are not employed by him as diagnostics, and are\r\nleft without a name. By dividing the areolets of the Intermediate\r\nArea of these wings into _three_ portions, the _basal_, _medial_,\r\nand _apical_[1896], I have endeavoured to remedy this defect, and by\r\nnaming each set of areolets in the middle portion, as you will see in\r\nthe Orismological Definitions, under the term _Areolets_, you will\r\nfind it easy to describe any given areolet and its place in the wing;\r\nthose of the base may be called the _anterior_, _intermediate_, and\r\n_posterior_, where _three_ occur; and the first and last of these\r\nterms will suffice where there are only _two_; the apical areolets,\r\nor those that are open to the margin, may be called, _first_,\r\n_second_, and _third_ in the order of their occurrence, reckoning\r\nfrom the anterior or costal margin.\r\n\r\nIn this Order it is curious to trace the progress of neuration in\r\nthe wings of different genera. Thus in _Psilus_ only the _costal_\r\nnervure and the _stigma_ are to be traced[1897]; in _Chalcis_ the\r\n_postcostal_ and _stigma_[1898]; in _Codrus_ and _Leucospis_ the\r\n_costal_, _postcostal_, _stigma_, and a nervure representing the\r\n_externo-medial_ and _interno-medial_ coalescing into one[1899];\r\nin _Omalus_ the _basilar_ areolets appear[1900]; in _Crabro_ both\r\n_basilar_ and _medial_[1901]; in _Cynips basilar_, _medial_, and\r\n_apical_[1902]; and in _Hylotoma_ the wing is filled with its\r\ngreatest complement of areolets[1903]. The medial areolets of\r\nthe Intermediate Area, as you will see in the definitions, form\r\n_three_ distinct series; these may be called the _protomesal_,\r\n_deuteromesal_, and _tritomesal_, reckoning from the postcostal\r\nareolets; the first of these corresponds with the cubital cellules of\r\nJurine. These series may be expressed, according to the number of\r\ntheir areolets; by figures, the protomesal standing first. They vary\r\nmuch in this respect in the different genera. Thus in _Cyclostoma_\r\nK.[1904], reckoning the didymous areolet as two, the numbers\r\nwill stand 4:2:1; in _Hylotoma_, &c., 3:2:1[1905]; in _Aulacus_,\r\n&c., 2:2:1[1906]; in _Bracon_, &c., 2:1:1[1907]; in _Chelonus_,\r\n2:0:1[1908]; in _Cynips erythrocephalus_ Jur., 2:0:0[1909]; in\r\n_Formica_, 1:1:1[1910]; in _Oxybelus_, 1:0:1[1911]; in _Chrysis_,\r\n0:1:1[1912]; and in _Cynips Rubi_ K., 1:0:0[1913]. The most natural\r\nnumber is 3:2:1. The next in importance to the medial areolets of the\r\nIntermediate Area are the _apical_, or those open to the margin; the\r\nmost usual number of them, excluding the postcostal areolets which\r\nbelong to the Costal Area, is _three_; but in _Sirex_ there is an\r\napproach to _four_[1914]; in _Evania_ there are only _two_[1915];\r\nand in _Philanthus_ there are none[1916]; in many, as _Prosopis_,\r\n_Nomada_, _Andrena_[1917], though there is the usual number, they\r\nare incomplete and do not reach the margin. The _basal_ areas are\r\nof little importance in assisting to determine genera; they are\r\nmost commonly _two_ in number, but in _Cynips_, &c., there is only\r\n_one_[1918]. The shape and other circumstances of the areolets vary\r\nconsiderably in different genera and species: upon these however\r\nI shall not enlarge further, but proceed in the next place to\r\nconsider very briefly the wings of the _Diptera_ Order as to their\r\nneuration. These are not so easily made subservient to a general\r\nplan. The _basilar_ areolets are now reduced considerably in length,\r\noccupying merely the base of the wing[1919]; the _medial_ are become\r\nless numerous and important[1920]; and the _apical_, in a variety\r\nof instances, are the most conspicuous[1921]; in some wings, as in\r\nthose of _Penthetria_, the Intermediate Area has no nervures or\r\nareolets, or only spurious ones; in _Psychoda_ the nervures diverge\r\nfrom the base almost without branching, so as to form no closed\r\nareolets[1922]; in many, the lower medial areolets are very long,\r\nresembling the basilar in _Hymenoptera_[1923]; these are often\r\ncrowned by a single small one, as in the _Stratyomidæ_, _Tipula_,\r\n&c., from which numerous branches proceed to the margin[1924]; but in\r\n_Musca_ two large ones approach the margin, the anterior one having\r\nan angle open to it[1925]; in the _Hippoboscidæ_ almost the whole of\r\nthe wing is occupied by the apical areolets[1926]; though in some\r\ncases they are incomplete[1927].\r\n\r\n4. I am next to consider the _position_ of wings in _repose_ and\r\ntheir _folding_. The most important object of this is that when\r\nunemployed they may occupy less space, be less in the way of the\r\ninsect, and be most effectually protected from injury. Another end is\r\nalso served by this structure,--that wings can thus be very ample,\r\nand present a large surface to the action of the atmosphere without\r\nincommoding the insect when it has not occasion to use them.\r\n\r\nWith respect to this head, insects may be divided into _two_\r\nclasses--namely, those whose wings in repose are covered by\r\nwing-cases harder than the wings themselves, and those that have\r\nno such protection. In the former the wings, though the rule\r\nadmits several exceptions, have more folds than in the latter. As\r\nthe different mode of folding the wings has been assumed for a\r\ncharacteristic of the earlier Orders, I shall explain to you with as\r\nmuch brevity as possible how each is circumstanced in this respect,\r\nbeginning as usual with the _Coleoptera_.\r\n\r\nThere are _two_ principal folds of the wing in this Order, which\r\nmay be named the _anal_ and the _apical_: the _former_ is when\r\nthe Anal Area or part of it is folded on the under surface of the\r\nbase of the wing; this fold is always more or less _longitudinal_:\r\nthe _latter_, the apical fold, is by means of the _commissura_\r\nor joint of the _postcosta_ lately mentioned: which in _Hister_,\r\n_Staphylinus_, &c., for obvious reasons[1928] is nearer the base\r\nof the wing; in _Necrophorus_ in the middle; in _Dynastes Aloeus_\r\nbeyond the middle[1929]; in _Tenebrio Molitor_ near the apex; and\r\nin _Dytiscus marginalis_ there appears to be no joint at all; but\r\nthe fact is, that in this insect the _postcosta_,--the termination\r\nof which really forms the joint, the _costa_ itself being only\r\nflexible at that point,--stands at a greater distance from the latter\r\nat its end. Well, at this joint the above fold is made, the apex\r\nof the wing, being first folded longitudinally, turning under and\r\ninwards, and forming an angle, more or less acute, with the joint or\r\ncostal margin, so that the fold is not quite but nearly transverse:\r\nthis at least is the case in _Geotrupes stercorarius_ and other\r\nLamellicorns: in _Staphylinus_, &c., there are several transverse and\r\nlongitudinal folds, and thus the wing is more easily packed under\r\nthe short elytra; in _Molorchus_, _Necydalis_, &c., in which it is\r\nleft uncovered, except at its base, the anal fold takes place, and\r\nthe apical in some degree; a short portion near the apex forming an\r\nobtuse angle with the margin; in _Atractocerus_ the wing appears to\r\nbe only _longitudinally_ folded; and in _Buprestis vittata_ only\r\nthe _anal_ fold is to be detected. Besides these transverse and\r\nlongitudinal folds these organs, in many beetles, have an infinity of\r\nfine corrugations, which ramify like the nervures of the _tegmina_\r\nof _Flata_[1930], &c., proceeding from the Costal Area or the disk\r\nof the wing to the posterior margin; the object of these plicatures\r\nis doubtless to present a more ample surface to the action of the\r\natmosphere in flight[1931]. When all these folds have been made in\r\na Coleopterous wing, the apex of the one at its posterior margin\r\ncrosses or rests upon that of the other[1932].\r\n\r\nIn the _Dermaptera_[1933], at least the common earwig, there is a\r\ntriple transverse fold of the wing, and besides this it has numerous\r\nlongitudinal ones like those of a fan, each of the diverging nervures\r\nrepresenting one of the sticks. In the _Strepsiptera_ the folds\r\nare only longitudinal; a circumstance which, besides the form and\r\nneuration of the wing, sufficiently attests that its station is\r\nmore near the _Orthoptera_ and _Coleoptera_ than the _Diptera_. We\r\nnext come to the _Orthoptera_[1934]; in these the folds in general\r\nare longitudinal; and those of the Anal Area in particular, either\r\nin whole or in part, exact counterparts of a fan: wherever there\r\nis a straight nervure, there is usually a fold or a tendency to\r\nit; this is the case even with the short oblique ones observable\r\nin the Intermediate Area of _Blatta_: in this tribe the Anal Area,\r\nor a considerable portion of it, is folded under the rest of the\r\nwing, and the whole lies on the back of the animal, so that in this\r\nwing there are only two primary folds; but in those with a narrower\r\nbody, as _Phasma_, &c., there are more, and the Anal Area, folded\r\nlike a fan, lies horizontally on the back; the Costal is vertically\r\napplied to the sides, and the Intermediate is between both, as in the\r\n_tegmina_[1935]. In _Gryllus_ Latr., _Gryllotalpa_, &c., when the\r\nwings are folded, the end of the Anal Area projects so as to present\r\nthe appearance of two tails[1936]; and in that remarkable Chinese\r\nanimal _Gryllus monstrosus_, in which these tails are very long,\r\nthey are convolute like those of some quadrupeds[1937]. It is to be\r\nobserved that in the secondary folds of these wings the angles of the\r\nfolds are surmounted by a nervure.\r\n\r\nIn both sections of the _Hemiptera_ Order, as in the _Coleoptera_,\r\nthe Anal Area is turned under the wing and lies over the back of\r\nthe insect; this is the only _primary_ fold, but besides there are\r\nseveral longitudinal semifolds or _secondary_ ones, in which one\r\npart of the surface forms an obtuse angle with another; and in\r\n_Tettigonia_, &c., these folds ramify in the wings as well as in\r\nthe _tegmina_ at the margin: a number of semifolds also, sometimes\r\ntransverse and sometimes oblique, run in pairs from each side of\r\nevery nervure of the disk of both _tegmina_ and wings in the genus\r\nlast named, the use of which has been before mentioned[1938].\r\n\r\nWe now come to those Orders that have _four_ membranous wings: first,\r\nI shall consider the _Lepidoptera_. With respect to the position of\r\ntheir wings in repose some variations take place. In the majority\r\nof the _day-fliers_ (_Papilio_ L.), when the animal reposes the\r\nwings are applied to each other by their upper surface so as to be\r\n_vertical_; but in the skippers (_Hesperia_), the secondary wings\r\nassume a _horizontal_ position, while the primary are _vertical_ but\r\napplied to each other. In the _Crepuscular_ tribes (_Sphinx_ L.)\r\nthe upper wings are incumbent on the lower, and deflexed. In the\r\n_night-fliers_ (_Phalæna_ L.) the types of position are various.\r\nIn some _Attacus_, _Saturnia_, _Noctua_, &c., the wings cover each\r\nother, and are a little inclined from a horizontal position; in\r\n_Gastropacha_, _Odenesis_, and some other _Bombycidæ_, they are\r\ndeflexed, and the anterior margin of the under wing projects beyond\r\nthat of the upper: in some of the _Tineæ_ L., as _Crambus_, the wings\r\nare convoluted, and in others, _Galleria_, they are applied close to\r\nthe sides of the body, and being elevated at the apex, terminate, to\r\nuse a French term--_en queue de coq_: in _Noctua_, _Geometra_, &c.,\r\nthe wings usually cover the abdomen, and are nearly horizontal. With\r\nregard to the _folds_ of their wings, the Anal Area of the secondary\r\nis the only part that has any striking one; in _Papilio Hector_\r\nand affinities it turns up so as to defend the sides and part of\r\nthe back of the abdomen; in _Morpho Teucer_ it turns down, and\r\nmeeting that of the opposite wing, forms a semitube which receives\r\nand shelters that part below. In the _Crepuscular_ and _Nocturnal_\r\nLepidoptera this fold, especially in the former, is very slight. With\r\nrespect to semifolds in the _Diurnal_, there is one originating in\r\nthe disk, between each of the nervures, that goes to the margin of\r\nthe wing; likewise the under wings, particularly of many _Noctuæ_,\r\n_Arctiæ_, &c., have many longitudinal semifolds.\r\n\r\nIn the _Neuroptera_ Order several variations take place with regard\r\nto the _position_ of these organs in repose: thus, in _Æshna_,\r\n_Libellula_, &c., they continue expanded; in _Argion_ they are\r\napplied to the body; in _Myrmeleon_ the upper are horizontally\r\nincumbent on the lower; in _Hemerobius_ they incline to the horizon.\r\nWith regard to their _folds_ in _Æshna_, &c., the longitudinal\r\nnervures alternately form the summit or the bottom of a semifold, as\r\ndo those branches that terminate in the posterior margin; this kind\r\nof plicature may be observed, but in a less degree, in _Ascalaphus_,\r\n_Myrmeleon_, &c.; in _Panorpa_ every nervure is the ridge of a\r\nslight fold; in _Termes_, on the contrary, it forms its bottom. In\r\nthe _Trichoptera_, the under wing being much more ample than the\r\nupper, the Anal Area forms a fold under the wing, and there seem\r\nlongitudinal secondary folds besides.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the _Hymenoptera_. In this Order the wings, as to\r\ntheir position in repose, are usually incumbent upon each other,\r\nand cover the abdomen; in the _Vespidæ_, however, they are placed\r\nparallel to the body, but do not cover it. Before I notice the\r\nplicature of these wings, I must recall your attention to what I\r\nlately observed[1939] with regard to Jurine's _bullæ_ (bubbles),\r\nbut which are really the _joints_ of the nervures, as they are to\r\nbe found only where the folds pass; and where they exist they are\r\nan index by which the folds, or rather semifolds, may be traced. I\r\ncounted eleven of these little joints in the upper wing of _Andrena\r\ncineraria_; sometimes, however, instead of a _bulla_, a nervure\r\nstops short to admit the fold. Wings in this Order have often three\r\nlongitudinal semifolds more or less conspicuous; these you may\r\ntrace in the saw-flies (_Tenthredo_ L.), whose wings Linné terms\r\n_tumidæ_, by which term he would indicate the elevation of the\r\nwhole surface produced by this structure; in the under wings of\r\nthese, and _Scolia_, _Bembex_, &c., the Anal Area is turned under\r\nthe wing, as in many preceding tribes[1940]: in _Sirex_, &c., that\r\nArea of the upper wing turns upwards, forming an acute angle with\r\nthe rest of the organ; the same circumstance distinguishes the under\r\nwing in the _Ichneumonidæ_. Several apical semifolds, marked by a\r\npellucid streak, distinguish _Tiphia_ F., and in _Bombus_, _Bembex_,\r\n&c., an infinity of branching ones, like those before described in\r\n_Coleoptera_, corrugate the apical margin. In the _Vespidæ_ the\r\n_upper_ wings are folded longitudinally into _three_ nearly equal\r\nportions, but in the _under_ ones the Anal Area only forms the fold.\r\n\r\nIn the _Diptera_ Order, as to their _position_ when at rest, the\r\nwings are mostly incumbent one on the other; but in _Psychoda_\r\nthey are deflexed, so as to form a kind of penthouse. With regard\r\nto their _plication_, in some, _Tipula oleracea_, &c., a slight\r\noblique semifold runs from the _stigma_ to the apical margin, and\r\nthe Anal Area has two, as it has in many _Muscidæ_, itself forming\r\nnearly a right angle with the rest of the wing; besides these it is\r\ncorrugated with minute transverse semifolds, which are observable\r\nalso in several other Dipterous insects; in many _Stratyomidæ_ they\r\nare oblique, and run from the disk to the posterior margin; and in\r\n_Asilus_, _Bombylius_, &c., they are wavy.\r\n\r\n5. We are next to say something upon the _shape_ of wings: this,\r\nthough apparently extremely various in the different Orders and\r\ntribes, may I think be traced in every wing to one original\r\nprototype, a _triangle_ with the largest angle rounded and subtended\r\nby the anterior or costal margin: in some, as the _Coleoptera_,\r\n_Orthoptera_, &c., this type of formation is a _right-angled_\r\ntriangle[1941]; and in others, as in the _Hymenoptera_, _Diptera_,\r\n&c., the majority of the _Neuroptera_, &c., it is an _obtusangled_\r\none[1942]; it may be further observed, that in receding from these\r\nforms wings very often assume that of the half or quadrant of\r\nsome regular figure, as we shall see when we consider those of\r\nthe different Orders. Another general observation I shall first\r\nmention,--that these organs are universally narrowest at their\r\nbase and widest at the apex, provided we consider as the apex the\r\ntermination outwards of the three Areas; otherwise we might say\r\nthat wings in the _Coleoptera_, _Orthoptera_, &c., were wider at\r\nthe base than at the apex[1943]. The wings in the former Order, and\r\nin several of the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_, as _Gerris_, _Velia_,\r\n&c., may in general, as to their _shape_, be termed semicordate\r\nor semiovate[1944]; in the _Dermaptera_ they incline to an oval\r\nfigure[1945]: in the _Strepsiptera_, _Orthoptera_, most Homopterous\r\nand many Heteropterous _Hemiptera_, they approach to the quadrant\r\nof a circle; in a considerable portion of the _Lepidoptera_ the two\r\nunder wings, if united at their posterior margin, approach a circular\r\nform; the upper ones vary a little from the prototype of the under\r\nones, forming an obtusangled triangle[1946]; in many _Neuroptera_\r\nthe _primary_ wings may be called oblong or linear-oblong, while the\r\n_secondary_ betray more evidently the _right-angled_ or _obtusangled_\r\ntriangle; in the _Hymenoptera_ this latter form is every where\r\nconspicuous, with little deviation, except in the rounding of the\r\nangles[1947]; and, finally, in the _Diptera_ this form shades off\r\nagain into an oblong, ovate, or linear shape, the wing being most\r\ncommonly attenuated at the base into a kind of footstalk[1948]. Some\r\nsingular variations with respect to the termination or marginal\r\nprocesses of the wings are exhibited by many _Lepidoptera_; thus in\r\n_Attacus Atlas_, &c., the primary wings are falcated or hooked at\r\ntheir apex[1949]; and in great numbers both wings are there scolloped\r\ninto alternate bays and capes, if I may so speak, varying in depth\r\nand length[1950]. There is usually a sinus between every pair of\r\nnervures, each of which terminates in the adjoining prominence, as\r\na fold does in the sinus[1951]. Where present, in the _primary_\r\nwings there are _eight_ of these sinuses, and in the _secondary_,\r\nwhere they are most usual, _seven_; some are remarkable for the long\r\n_tails_ which distinguish their secondary wings; those in _Papilio_\r\nare usually an elongation of the fifth, from the anterior margin, of\r\nthe prominences before mentioned, into a spathula-shaped diverging\r\nprocess, varying in length and width[1952]: but in _P. Ulysses_ it\r\ndoes not diverge; and in _P. Podalirius_ it is linear. They are\r\nfound also in other subgenera; thus in _Urania Patroclus_ there are\r\n_two_; in _U. Riphæus_ _three_; in _Erycina Cupido_ _five_; and in\r\n_E. Endymion_ _six_ of these tails; in some, as in _E. Dorylas_, the\r\nwhole wing seems to form the tail; in others again, as in _Hesperia\r\nProteus_ and _Bombyx Luna_, it is an elongation of the anal angle.\r\nOther wings in this Order are divided into lobes resembling feathers,\r\nas you may see in _Pterophorus hexadactylus_, &c.[1953]\r\n\r\n6. We are next to consider the _clothing_ of wings: these, in the\r\nOrders in which they are covered by elytra, tegmina, or hemelytra,\r\nare generally naked, except that the spots in those of _Fulgora\r\nlaternaria_, _serrata_, &c., and the whole wing in _Flata_,\r\n_Aleyrodes_, and others, are covered with a kind of farinaceous\r\npowder; but in all the remaining Orders, hairs or scales are more\r\nor less implanted in these organs: as the _Lepidoptera_ are the\r\nmost remarkable for the clothing of their wings, I shall leave them\r\ntill the last, and begin with the _Neuroptera_. If you lightly\r\npass your finger over the wing of any dragon-fly (_Libellula_ F.,\r\n_Æshna_ F.), from the apex towards the base, you will find that the\r\nlongitudinal nervures are, as it were, serrulated with very minute\r\nbristles, which point towards the extremity; if you next move the\r\nfinger across the wing, from the posterior to the anterior margin, a\r\nsimilar circumstance will strike you. M. Chabrier conjectures that,\r\namongst other uses[1954], these hairs may contribute to fix the\r\natmospheric fluid when the wings are depressed in flight, while it\r\nglides over them as they rise[1955]; in _Ascalaphus_, _Myrmeleon_,\r\n_Nemoptera_, _Hemerobius_, &c., the nervures are more visibly\r\nbristled; the bristles diverging on each side from the longitudinal\r\nones, but all pointing towards the apex from the connecting or\r\ntransverse ones; in _Panorpa_, besides these bristles, short hairs,\r\npointing the same way, are thickly planted in the membrane of the\r\nwing; and in _Hemerobius_ the margins of the wing are fringed; in\r\nthe _Ephemerina_, _Corydalis_, &c., the wings are naked. In the\r\n_Trichoptera_ Order, as their name imports, they are covered with\r\nminute decumbent hairs, less easily seen but still existing in the\r\nsecondary pair. In the _Hymenoptera_ in general the wings are covered\r\nwith minute hairs or bristles; but in _Tiphia_, _Scolia_--with the\r\nexception of _S. Radula_ and affinities in which they are hairy--and\r\nothers, the wings are nearly naked; in _Pompilus_, _Pepsis_, &c.,\r\nthe hairs are infinitely numerous and very short; in the _Sphecidæ_,\r\n_Mutilla_, &c., they are more distinct, longer, and less numerous;\r\nin the humble-bee (_Bombus_) and many others the apex of the wing is\r\ndarkened by a large number of more conspicuous hairs, each of which\r\nseems to spring from a minute tubercle: as these tubercles are in\r\na part of the wing that is strengthened by few nervures, they may\r\nprobably be intended to supply their place, in giving firmness and\r\ntension to this part. The wings of _Diptera_, under the present head,\r\nmay be viewed with regard to the hairs that are implanted in the\r\n_membrane_ of the wing, in its _nervures_, and in its _margin_. In\r\nthe first view, in _Stratyomis_ and immediate affinities the wing is\r\nnearly naked; but in _Xylophagus_, _Beris_, and the great majority\r\nof the Order, the membrane of the wings is thickly planted with\r\ninnumerable very minute bristles, not to be seen but under a powerful\r\nlens, often black, and seemingly crowning a little prominence, and\r\ngiving the wing an appearance of the finest net-work. As to the\r\nclothing of the nervures, the costal, in _Anthrax_, _Bombylius_,\r\n&c., is often remarkably bristly at the base, with hairs intermixed;\r\nin _Œstrus Ovis_, in the inner margin or edge of this nervure, is\r\na single series of bristles, or rather short spines, like so many\r\nblack points; in _Œ. Equi_ the whole _costa_ is covered with short\r\ndecumbent hairs or bristles; in _Musca pagana_ F., just at the apex\r\nof the costal areolet, that nervure is armed with a spur or diverging\r\nbristle larger than the rest, which is also to be found in many\r\nothers of the _Muscidæ_, some of which have two and others more of\r\nthese spurs. The little moth-like midges (_Psychoda_ Latr., _Hirtæa_\r\nF.) at first appear to have the whole surface of their wings covered\r\nwith hairs; but upon a closer examination it will be seen that they\r\nare planted in the nervures, from each of which they diverge, so\r\nas under a lens to give it a very elegant appearance[1956]. This\r\nfly has its wings beautifully fringed with fine hairs, the _third_\r\ncircumstance to be attended to under this head; in the Tipulidans,\r\nand many others of this Order, the apex and posterior margin are\r\nalso finely fringed with short hairs. Some Dipterous insects make a\r\nnear approach to the _Lepidoptera_ in the _covering_ of their wings:\r\nin the common gnat, when the wings are not rubbed, the nervures are\r\nadorned by a double series of _scales_, and the marginal fringe also\r\nconsists of them[1957]; and in a Georgian genus, which appears in\r\nsome degree to connect _Culex_ with _Anthrax_ &c., there are scales\r\nscattered upon the membrane as well as upon the nervures; besides,\r\nits antennæ[1958] and abdomen are also covered with them.\r\n\r\nThe Order, the clothing of whose organs of flight excites the\r\nadmiration of the most incurious beholder, is that to which the\r\nexcursive butterfly belongs, the _Lepidoptera_. The gorgeous wings of\r\nthese universal favourites, as well as those of the hawk-moths and\r\nmoths, owe all their beauty, not to the _substance_ of which they are\r\ncomposed, but to an infinite number of little _plumes_ or _scales_\r\nso thickly planted in their upper and under surface, as in the great\r\nmajority entirely to conceal that substance. Whether these are really\r\nmost analogous to plumes or scales has been thought doubtful. De\r\nGeer is inclined to think, from their terminating at their lower\r\nend in little quills and other circumstances, that they resemble\r\n_feathers_ as much as scales[1959]; Reaumur on the contrary suspects\r\nthat they come nearer to _scales_[1960]. Their substance, approaching\r\nto membrane, seems to make further for the former opinion, and their\r\nshape and the indentations that often occur in their extremity,\r\nfurnish an additional argument for the latter. Their numbers are\r\ninfinite; Leeuwenhoek found more than 400,000 on the wings of the\r\nsilk-worm moth (_Bombyx Mori_)[1961]; and in those of some of the\r\nlarger moths and butterflies the number must greatly exceed this.\r\nYou will observe however that in many _Lepidoptera_ the wings are\r\n_partially_, and in some instances _generally_, transparent: thus in\r\n_Hesperia Proteus_, a butterfly before noticed for the long tail that\r\ndistinguishes its secondary wings, there are many transparent spots;\r\nin _Attacus Atlas_, one of the largest of moths, and its affinities,\r\nthere is as it were a _window_ in each wing formed by a transparent\r\ntriangular space; in _A. Polyphemus_, _Paphia_, &c., the pupil of\r\nthe ocellus is transparent, which in the former is divided by a\r\nnervure. In several of the Heliconian butterflies, and in _Zygæna_\r\nF., &c., the greater part of both wings is transparent, with scales\r\nonly upon their nervures, round their margin, or forming certain\r\nbands or spots upon them; in _Parnassius Apollo_, _Mnemosyne_, &c.,\r\nthe scales are so arranged as not wholly to cover the wings, which\r\nrenders them semidiaphanous; and in some (_Nudaria_) the wings are\r\nintirely denuded. With regard to _size_, the scales vary often\r\nconsiderably in different tribes; in _Heliconia_ they appear to be\r\nmore minute than in the rest; and in _Castnia_ they are the largest\r\nand coarsest; the extremity of the wings of Lepidopterous insects in\r\ngeneral is fringed with longer scales than their surfaces, and even\r\nthose of the last in the same wing; sometimes vary in magnitude.\r\nThe little seeming tooth that projects from the middle of the\r\nposterior margin in the upper wings of _Notodonta_, a subgenus of\r\n_Bombyx_ L., is merely produced by some longer diverging hairs. The\r\n_shape_ and _figure_ also of scales are very various--some being\r\nlong and slender; others short and broad; some nearly round; others\r\noval, ovate, or oblong; others spathulate; others panduriform or\r\nparabolical; some again almost square or rhomboidal; many triangular;\r\nsome representing an isosceles triangle, and others an equilateral\r\none; lastly, some are lanceolate and others linear; again, some have\r\na very short pedicle and others a very long one: with regard to their\r\n_extremity_; some are intire, without projecting points or incisions,\r\nwhile others are furnished with them: of these some terminate in a\r\nsingle long mucro, others have several shorter ones; some are armed\r\nwith teeth, varying in number from two to thirteen in different\r\nspecies[1962]. Many other forms might be enumerated, but these are\r\nsufficient to give you a general notion of the infinite variety of\r\nthis part of the works of the CREATOR. I must next say a word or two\r\nupon their _arrangement_ on the wing. In most instances this is in\r\ntransverse lines, which sometimes vary a little from a rectilinear\r\ncourse, and the extremity of the scales of one row reposes on the\r\nbase of those of the succeeding one, so that in this respect their\r\narrangement is like that of tiles in a roof: in some cases it is\r\nnot so regular: thus the minute scales on the wings of _Parnassius\r\nApollo_, and others with subdiaphanous wings, are arranged without\r\norder; in _Pieris_ and other Diurnal _Lepidoptera_, and many of the\r\nCrepuscular and Nocturnal, there appears to be a _double_ layer of\r\nscales on both sides of the wing; the under layer usually consisting\r\nof _white_ ones. If you denude the wings of any butterfly, which you\r\nmay easily do by scraping it lightly on both sides with a penknife,\r\nyou will be amused to trace the lines in which the scales were\r\nplanted, consisting of innumerable minute dots: the lines of the\r\nunder side, in some cases, so cut those of the upper side, as by\r\ntheir intersection to form lozenges. With regard to the position of\r\nthe scales on the wing, they usually lie flat, but sometimes their\r\nextremity is incurved: in the beautiful _Argynnis Vanillæ_ a very\r\nsingular appearance of numerous transverse ridges is produced by the\r\nextremity of those scales that cover the longitudinal nervures of the\r\nprimary wings, except at the base, being recurved.\r\n\r\nBut though the general clothing of the wings of _Lepidoptera_ consists\r\nof these little scales, yet in some cases they are either replaced by\r\n_hairs_ or mixed with them. Thus, in the _clear_ parts of the wings of\r\nHeliconians, _Attaci_, &c., short inconspicuous hairs are planted; in\r\na large number of the Orders the _upper_ side of the Anal Area of the\r\nsecondary wings is hairy; in several Crepusculars (_Sphinx Phœnix_,\r\n&c.), where there is a double layer as before mentioned, the upper\r\none consists of dense hairs, except at the apex, and the lower one\r\nof scales; and in most of them the scales of the primary wings are\r\npiliform, and the secondary are covered by what approach very near to\r\nreal hairs; many of the _Attaci_ are similarly circumstanced: the four\r\nwings of _A. Cytherea_ are also covered externally with hair.\r\n\r\n7. Before I conclude this long diatribe on the organs of flight of\r\ninsects, I must not omit some notice of the infinite diversity of\r\n_colours_ with which their wings are often variegated and adorned\r\nby the CREATOR, who loves to delight us by the beauty, as well as\r\nto astonish and awe us by the immensity and grandeur of his works.\r\nThough the wings in every Order exhibit instances of brilliant and\r\nbeautiful colouring, yet those of the _Lepidoptera_ in this respect\r\ninfinitely excel them all, and to these, under this head, after\r\nnoticing a few in the less privileged Orders, my observations will\r\nbe confined. Although in the _Coleoptera_ the wings are seldom\r\ndistinguished by their splendour; yet those of some _Cetoniadæ_,\r\nas _Cetonia africana_, are extremely brilliant, and resemble those\r\nof many _Xylocopæ_ in the lovely violet hue that adorns them:\r\namongst the _Orthoptera_ some _Pterophyllæ_, and in the Homopterous\r\n_Hemiptera_ some _Fulgoræ_, emulate the _Lepidoptera_ in the _ocelli_\r\nthat give a kind of life to these organs[1963]; and a vast number of\r\nthe destructive tribe of locusts (_Locusta_ Leach) are remarkable for\r\nthe fine colours and gaiety of their wings[1964]; in the _Neuroptera_\r\nnumerous _Libellulinæ_ emulate the Heliconian butterflies by their\r\nmaculation; and in the genus _Ascalaphus_, which represents the\r\n_Lepidoptera_ by its clubbed antennæ[1965], many also have the\r\nresemblance increased by the painting of their wings, so that some\r\nEntomologists have actually considered some of them as belonging to\r\nthat Order[1966]; the wings of the _Xylocopæ_, before alluded to,\r\nsometimes add to the deep tints of the violet--which also prevail\r\nin the wings of several _Diptera_--towards their extremity the most\r\nbrilliant metallic green or copper varying,\r\n\r\n          \"As the site varies in the gazer's hand,\"\r\n\r\nand even those wings that consist of clear colourless membrane\r\nare often rendered extremely beautiful from the reflection of the\r\nprismatic colours. I should undertake an endless task did I attempt\r\nto specify all the modes of marking, clouding, and spotting, that\r\nvariegate a wing, and all the shades of colour that paint it, amongst\r\nthe Lepidopterous tribes; I shall therefore confine myself to a\r\nfew of the principal, especially those that distinguish particular\r\ntribes and families. Of whole coloured wings--I know none that dazzle\r\nthe eye of the beholder so much as the upper surface of those of\r\n_Morpho Menelaus_ and _Telemachus_: Linné justly observes that there\r\nis scarcely any thing in nature that for brightness and splendour\r\ncan be paralleled with this colour; it is a kind of rich ultramarine\r\nthat vies with the deepest and purest azure of the sky; and what\r\nmust cause a striking contrast in flight, the prone surface of the\r\nwings is as dull and dark as the supine is brilliant, so that one\r\ncan conceive this animal to appear like a planet in full radiance,\r\nand under eclipse, as its wings open and shut in the blaze of a\r\ntropical sun: another butterfly, _Papilio Ulysses_, by its radiating\r\ncerulean disk, surrounded on every side by a margin intensely black,\r\ngives the idea of light first emerging from primeval obscurity; it\r\nwas probably this idea of light shining in darkness that induced\r\nLinné to give it the name of the wisest of the Greeks in a dark and\r\nbarbarous age. I know no insect upon which the sight rests with\r\nsuch untired pleasure, as upon the lovely butterfly that bears the\r\nname of the unhappy Trojan king (_P. Priamus_); the contrast of the\r\nrich green and black of the velvet of its wings with each other,\r\nand with the orange of its abdomen, is beyond expression regal and\r\nmagnificent. But peculiar beauties of colour sometimes distinguish\r\nwhole _tribes_ as well as _individuals_. What can be more lovely\r\nthan that tribe of little butterflies that flit around us every\r\nwhere in our summer rambles, which are called _blues_, and which\r\nexhibit the various tints of the sky? _Lycæna Adonis_ of this tribe\r\nscarcely yields to any exotic butterfly in the celestial purity of\r\nits azure wings: our native _coppers_ also, _Lycæna dispar_[1967],\r\n_Virgaureæ_, &c., are remarkable for the fulgid colour of these\r\norgans; in _Argynnis_ the upper side of their wings is tawny,\r\nspotted with black, while the under side of the secondary ones is\r\nvery often adorned by the appearance of _silver_ spots. How this\r\nremarkable effect of metallic lustre, so often reflected by spots in\r\nthe wings of butterflies, is produced, seems not to have occupied\r\nthe attention of Entomologists. M. Audebert is of opinion that the\r\nsimilar lustre of the plumes of the humming birds (_Trochilus_) is\r\nowing to their density, to the polish of their surface, and to the\r\ngreat number of little minute concave mirrors which are observable\r\non their little beards[1968]. But these observations will not apply\r\nto the scales of the wings of butterflies, which are always very\r\nthin and generally very flat: in some instances, as in _Morpho\r\nMenelaus_, there appears more than one very slight channel upon a\r\nscale; but this takes place also in others that reflect no lustre.\r\nTheir metallic hues must therefore principally be occasioned by\r\nthe high polish of their surface and the richness of their tints.\r\nIt is the purity of the white, in conjunction with their shining\r\nsurface, contrasted with the dull opaque colour of the under side\r\nof the secondary wings, that causes the spots that decorate those\r\nof the Fritillaries (_Argynnis_) to emulate the lustre of silver.\r\nIn _Papilio_ the Trojans are distinguished by the black wings with\r\nsanguine spots, and the Greeks by the same with yellow spots; but\r\nthese have proved in some instances only sexual distinctions[1969].\r\nIn the _Danai candidi_ L. the colour of the tribe may be described\r\nas sacred to the _day_, since every shade, from white or the palest\r\nyellow to full orange, is exhibited by them. The yellows prevail also\r\nin those _Noctuæ_, the trivial names of which Linné made to end in\r\n_ago_, as _N. Fulvago_, _Citrago_, &c. I must not conclude this part\r\nof my subject without noticing one of the most striking ornaments of\r\nthe wings of _Lepidoptera_, the many-coloured _eyes_ which decorate\r\nso large a number of them. Some few birds, as the Peacock and Argus\r\nPheasant, have been decked by their CREATOR very conspicuously with\r\nthis almost dazzling glory; but in the insects just named it meets us\r\nevery where. Some, as one of our most beautiful butterflies, _Vanessa\r\nIo_[1970], have them both on the primary and secondary wings;\r\nothers, as _Noctua Bubo_[1971], only on the primary; others again,\r\nas _Smerinthus ocellata_[1972], only on the secondary: in some also\r\nthey are on both sides of the wing, as in _Hipparchia Ægeria_[1973],\r\nand in others only on the upper side, as in _Vanessa Io_; in others\r\nagain only on the under side, as in _Morpho Teucer_[1974]: in some\r\nlikewise they are very large, as in the secondary wings of the same\r\nbutterfly: and in others very small, as in those in the wings of the\r\nblues (_Lycæna_). Once more, in some they consist only of _iris_ and\r\n_pupil_, as in _Hipparchia Semele_, and in others of many concentric\r\ncircles besides, as in _Morpho Teucer_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nv. _Legs_[1975]. We are next to consider those organs of motion\r\naffixed to the trunk, by which insects transport themselves\r\nfrom one place to another on the earth or in the water, and by\r\nwhich also they perform various operations connected with their\r\neconomy[1976]. In treating of them we should consider their _number_;\r\n_kind_; _substance_; _articulation_ with the _trunk_; _position_;\r\n_proportions_; _clothing_; _composition_; _folding_; and _motions_.\r\n\r\n1. _Number._ Having before very fully explained to you the number\r\nand kind of the legs of insects in their _preparatory_ states[1977],\r\nI shall now confine myself to the consideration of these organs\r\nin their _perfect_ or last state; beginning with their _number_.\r\nInsects, properly so called, as I formerly observed[1978], in this\r\nstate, including the anterior pair or arms, have only _six_ legs,\r\nnone exceeding or falling short of this number; but in several of\r\nthe Diurnal _Lepidoptera_ (_Vanessa_, &c.) the anterior pair are\r\n_spurious_, or at least not used as legs, the tarsi having neither\r\njoints nor claws[1979]; this in some cases is said to be only a\r\n_sexual_ distinction[1980]. In _Onitis_, _Phanæus_, and some other\r\n_Scarabæidæ_ M^cL., the arm has either none or a spurious tarsus or\r\n_manus_[1981]; which in the first of these genera is also a sexual\r\ncharacter. From both these instances we see that walking is only a\r\n_secondary_ use of forelegs in the insect tribes. Besides insects\r\nproper, a whole tribe of mites (_Caris_ Latr., _Leptus_ Latr., _Astoma_\r\nLatr., _Ocypete_ Leach) have only _six_ legs; the rest, and the\r\n_Arachnida_ in general, have _eight_; in the _Myriapods_, _Pollyxenus_\r\nhas _twelve pairs_; _Scutigera_ has _fifteen_; the terrestrial\r\n_Glomerides_ (_G. Armadillo_, &c.) _sixteen_; and the oceanic (_G.\r\novalis_) _twenty_; the oriental _Scolopendræ_ Leach, _twenty-one_;\r\n_Polydesmus_ has usually about _thirty pairs_; _Craspedosoma_,\r\n_fifty_; _Geophilus electricus_ at least _sixty_; in _Iulus terrestris_\r\nthere are more than _seventy_; in _I. sabulosus_ nearly _one hundred_;\r\nin _I. fuscus_, 124; and in _I. maximus_ 134 pairs or 268 single legs.\r\nBut with respect to the _Geophili_, _Iuli_, &c., it is to be observed,\r\nthat the number of pairs varies in different individuals; and the\r\ncircumstance that has been before mentioned[1982], that these animals\r\nkeep acquiring legs in their progress to the perfect state, instead\r\nof losing them, renders it difficult to ascertain what is the natural\r\nnumber of pairs in any species.\r\n\r\n2. _Kinds._ Upon a former occasion I gave you a sufficiently full\r\naccount of the _kinds_ of legs[1982], and I have also assigned my\r\nreasons for giving a different denomination to the _anterior_ legs\r\nunder certain circumstances[1983]; I shall not therefore enlarge\r\nfurther upon this head.\r\n\r\n3. _Substance._ The _substance_ of the legs is generally regulated\r\nmore or less by that of the rest of the body, only in soft-bodied\r\ninsects they seem usually more firm and unbending. Each joint is a\r\ntube, including the moving muscles, nerves, and air vessels.\r\n\r\n4. _Articulation with the Trunk._ M. Cuvier has observed that the\r\nhip (_coxa_), which is the joint that unites the leg with the body,\r\nrather inosculates, in its acetabulum, than articulates in any\r\nprecise manner[1984]; but this observation, though true of a great\r\nmany, will not apply universally, for the legs of _Orthopterous_\r\ninsects, and of most of the subsequent Orders, are _suspended_\r\nrather than inosculating. Even in many _Coleoptera_ a difference\r\nis observable in this respect. I have before mentioned that what\r\nare called the _puncta ordinaria_, which distinguish the sides of\r\nthe _prothorax_ of many _Scarabæidæ_ and _Geotrupidæ_, form a base\r\nfor an elevation of the interior surface with which the extremity\r\nof the base of the clavicle, which plunges deep into the breast,\r\nginglymates[1985]; this structure may also be found in other\r\nLamellicorns, as the stag-beetle (_Lucanus_) and _Dynastes_, that\r\nhave not those excavations; in these last it is an elevated ridge\r\nforming a segment of a circle with, it should seem, a posterior\r\nchannel, receiving a corresponding cavity and protuberance of the\r\nclavicle. With regard to the mid-leg, in _Copris_, the _coxa_ is\r\nemboxed in a nearly longitudinal cavity of the _medipectus_, and the\r\n_coxa_ of the hind-leg anteriorly is suspended to a transverse cavity\r\nof the _postpectus_, but posteriorly it is received by a cavity of\r\nthe first segment of the abdomen; so that it may be regarded as\r\nsuspended anteriorly, and inosculating posteriorly.\r\n\r\nIn some tribes of this Order, as the Weevils (_Curculio_ L.) and\r\nCapricorns (_Cerambyx_), the coxæ of the four anterior legs are\r\nsubglobose[1986] and extremely lubricous, and are received each by\r\na socket that fits it, and is equally lubricous. In the bottom of\r\nthis externally, and in the head of the coxa, is an orifice for\r\nthe transmission of muscles, nerves, and bronchiæ; but the coxa\r\nis suspended by ligament in the socket. This structure approaches\r\nas near the ball and socket as the nature of the insect skeleton\r\nwill permit; the high polish of the articulations acts the part of\r\n_synovia_, and the motion is in some degree rotatory or versatile,\r\nwhereas in _Copris_, &c., lately mentioned, it seems to be more\r\nlimited, and is probably, at least in the mid- and hind-legs, only\r\nin two directions; in the middle pair, probably, from the _coxæ_\r\nbeing in a position parallel with the breast, opposite to that of the\r\nhind pair. In _Dytiscus_ L., _Carabus_ L., and some other beetles,\r\nthe coxæ, especially the posterior pair, appear to be fixed and\r\nincapable of motion. In many insects these coxæ seem to belong as\r\nmuch to the abdomen as to the trunk. We have just seen this to be the\r\ncase in _Copris_, &c.; and in the _Lepidoptera_, if the former be\r\nseparated from the latter, the legs will be detached with it.\r\n\r\n4. _Location._ We are now to consider the _location_ and _position_\r\nof the legs, both in general and with respect to each other. And\r\nfirst, as has been before stated, we may observe that, in the\r\nhexapods with wings, the _arms_ belong to the _manitrunk_, and are\r\nattached to the _antepectus_ on each side the _prosternum_; and the\r\ntwo pair of _legs_ to the _alitrunk_, the _mid-legs_ being attached\r\nto the _medipectus_, between the _scapularia_ and _mesosternum_; and\r\nthe _hind-legs_ to the _postpectus_, between the _parapleura_ and\r\nthe _posternum_; and further, that the _arms_ are opposed to the\r\n_prothorax_: the _mid-legs_ to the _mesothorax_ and the _primary_\r\norgans of flight; and the _hind-legs_ to the _metathorax_ and the\r\n_secondary_ organs of flight; though in some cases the wings appear\r\nto be _behind_ the legs and in others _before_ them: thus, in\r\n_Panorpa_, the former are nearer the head than the latter; but in\r\nthe _Libellulina_ the reverse of this takes place, the legs being\r\nmuch nearer the head than the wings: in both cases, however, the\r\n_scapularia_ and _parapleuræ_ run from the legs to the wings, but\r\nin an oblique direction; and in _Panorpa_ these pieces assume the\r\nappearance of articulations of the legs. In most of the _apterous_\r\nhexapods they appear to be attached laterally between the _thorax_\r\nand the _pectus_[1987]; but in the flea (_Pulex_) they are _ventral_.\r\nIn this tribe the arms are usually stated to be inserted in the\r\n_head_[1988]: but I once succeeded in separating the head of a\r\nflea from the trunk, and these organs remained attached to the\r\nlatter[1989]. As to the _Octopods_ and _Arachnidæ_, in the mites\r\n(_Acarus_ L.) they are lateral, and in their analogues, the spiders\r\n(_Aranea_ L.), they emerge between the thorax and the breast,\r\nwhich last they nearly surround; in the _Phalangidæ_ the bases of\r\nthe coxæ approach near to each other, being separated only by a\r\nnarrow _sternum_; in their antagonists, _Chelifer_ and _Scorpio_,\r\nthey apply to each other, the anterior ones acting as _maxillæ_.\r\nIn the _myriapods_ the legs of the _Chilopoda_ Latr., and some\r\n_Chilognatha_, as _Glomeris_, are inserted laterally, a single pair\r\nin a segment; but in _Iulus_ L. their attachment is ventral, the coxæ\r\nseem to spring from a common base, and there are two pair to each\r\nsegment[1990], except the three first, which bear each a single pair.\r\n\r\nI shall next consider how the legs are located with respect to each\r\nother. To render this clear to you I shall represent each of the\r\nvariations, which amount in all to twelve in the hexapods that have\r\nfallen under my notice, by six dots.\r\n\r\n1. [Illustration: dots] In this arrangement the legs are all planted\r\nnear to each other, there being little or no interval between the\r\npairs, and between the legs of each pair. It is exemplified in the\r\n_Lepidoptera_, _Blatta_, and many _Diptera_.\r\n\r\n2. [Illustration: dots] Similar to the preceding, but the anterior pair\r\nare distant from the two posterior; exemplified in the bees (_Apis_)\r\nand most _Hymenoptera_; _Chironomus_; _Scutellera_; _Pachysoma_ K.[1991]\r\n\r\n3. [Illustration: dots] Like the last, but the posterior pair is\r\ndistant from the two anterior. _Examples_: _Silpha_, _Necrophorus_,\r\n_Telephorus_, &c.\r\n\r\n4. [Illustration: dots] Similar to the last, but the legs of the\r\nposterior pair are more distant from each other than the four\r\nanterior. _Ex. Curculio_ L.\r\n\r\n5. [Illustration: dots] The legs of each pair near each other, but\r\nthe pairs distant. _Ex. Gibbium._\r\n\r\n6. [Illustration: dots] Both the legs of each pair and the pairs\r\ndistant. _Ex. Blaps_, &c.\r\n\r\n7. [Illustration: dots] Anterior pair distant from the two posterior,\r\nand the legs of the middle pair rather more distant from each other\r\nthan those of the other pairs. _Ex. Scarabæus_ M^cL.\r\n\r\n8. [Illustration: dots] Like the preceding, only the legs of the middle\r\npair are at a much greater distance from each other. _Ex. Copris_ M^cL.\r\n\r\n9. [Illustration: dots] Legs of the two posterior pairs distant. _Ex.\r\nHister_, _Scaphidium_.\r\n\r\n10. [Illustration: dots] Like the preceding, but the posterior legs\r\nmore distant than those of the middle pair. _Ex. Lygæus._\r\n\r\n11. [Illustration: see previous] Like the last, but the legs of the\r\nanterior pair also distant. _Ex. Velia._\r\n\r\n12. [Illustration: see previous] The arms distant, intermediate legs\r\nmore distant, posterior legs close together. _Ex. Byrrhus_ L.\r\n\r\n5. _Proportions._ In general the legs of some insects are\r\ndisproportionally _long_ and _slender_, as in _Phalangium Opilio_\r\nand some species of _Gonyleptes_[1992]: those of others are\r\ndisproportionally _short_, as in _Elater_, &c. With regard to their\r\nrelative proportions, the most general rule is, in Hexapods, that\r\nthe anterior pair shall be the shortest and most slender, and the\r\nposterior the longest and thickest; but there are many exceptions:\r\nthus, in _Macropus longimanus_, _Clytra longimana_, &c., in the male\r\nthe _arms_ are the longest; again, a thing that very rarely occurs,\r\nin the same sex of _Podalirius retusa_ the _intermediate legs_ are\r\nthe longest[1993]; but in _Rhina barbirostris_ and many weevils they\r\nare the shortest: in _Saperda hirtipes_ Oliv.[1994] the _hind-legs_\r\nare disproportionally long: with regard to _thickness_, they are in\r\ngeneral extremely slender in _Cicindela_, and in the _Scarabæidæ_ very\r\n_thick_. In _Goliathus Cacicus_ the arms are more robust than the four\r\nlegs[1995]; in _Gyrinus_ the latter are more dilated than the former;\r\nin many _Rutelidæ_, and particularly in the celebrated Kanguroo beetle\r\n(_Scarabæus Macropus_ Franc.) the hind-legs are much the thickest; in\r\na new genus of weevils from Brazil (_Plectropus_ K.), the intermediate\r\npair are more slender than either the arms or the posterior pair.\r\n\r\n6. _Clothing._ The _hairs_ on the legs of insects, though at first\r\nsight they may seem unimportant, in many cases are of great use to\r\nthem, both in their ordinary avocations and motions: but as most\r\nof these were sufficiently noticed when I treated of the sexes of\r\ninsects[1996], I shall not here repeat my observations, but confine\r\nmyself to cases not then adverted to. Some insects have all their\r\nlegs very hairy, as many spiders, the diamond beetle (_Entimus\r\nimperialis_), or at least a species very near it and common in\r\nBrazil[1997], &c.: in others they are nearly naked, as in the\r\nstag-beetle. In the Crepuscular _Lepidoptera_ (_Sphinx_ L.) and\r\nsome of the Nocturnal ones (_Bombyx_ L.) the thighs are much more\r\nhairy than the rest of the legs: and in _Lucanus_, _Geotrupes_,\r\nand many other Lamellicorns, &c., the anterior ones have a yellow\r\nor golden spot at their base, composed of decumbent hairs, which\r\nprevent them from suffering by the violent friction to which they\r\nare exposed in burrowing. In most Petalocerous beetles the tibiæ are\r\nset with scattered bristles, and sometimes the thighs. The Tiger\r\nbeetles (_Cicindela_) are similarly circumstanced: but the bristles,\r\nwhich are white, are generally arranged in rows. In _Dytiscus_,\r\n_Hydrophilus_, &c., the four posterior tarsi; and in _Notonecta_\r\nthe posterior pair, and also the tibiæ--are fringed on each side\r\nwith a dense series of hairs, which structure assists them in\r\nswimming[1998]. The tarsi, especially the anterior pair, in a certain\r\nfamily of _Lamia_ F. (_L. papulosa_, &c.[1999]), are similarly\r\nfringed, only the hairs curl inwards; and the _hand_ in _Sphex_\r\nand _Ammophila_, but not in _Pelopæus_ and _Chlorion_, is fringed\r\nexternally with long bristles.\r\n\r\n7. _Composition._ With regard to their _composition_, both arms and\r\nlegs generally consist of _five_ pieces, which Entomologists have\r\ndenominated--the _coxa_ or _hip_--the _trochanter_--the _femur_ or\r\nthigh--the _tibia_ or shank--and the _tarsus_ or foot. Where the\r\nstructure and use of the fore-leg is different from that of the four\r\nhind-legs, I propose calling these pieces by names corresponding\r\nwith those which anatomists have appropriated to the _arm_ in the\r\nhigher vertebrate animals: thus, as you will see in the table, I call\r\nthe whole fore-leg the _brachium_ or arm; and the _coxa_ becomes\r\nthe _clavicula_ or collar-bone; the _trochanter_, the _scapula_ or\r\nshoulder-blade; the _femur_, the _humerus_ or shoulder; the _tibia_,\r\nthe _cubitus_ or arm; the _tarsus_, the _manus_ or hand. But let me\r\nnot lead you to suppose that the pieces, either in the arms or legs\r\nof insects, which are there named after certain others in vertebrate\r\nanimals, precisely correspond with them--by no means--since that\r\nis a very doubtful point; and some of them, as the _trochanter_,\r\nclearly do not. Many gentlemen skilled in anatomy, as I have before\r\nobserved[2000], have thought that what is regarded as the _coxa_ in\r\ninsects really represents the _femur_: but there are considerable\r\ndifficulties in the way of this supposition, several of which I then\r\nstated. I shall not however enter further into the subject, and take\r\nthe above names; since this application of them is so general and so\r\nwell understood, except with regard to the fore-leg, under certain\r\ncircumstances, as I find them. I shall now consider them in the order\r\nin which I have named them.\r\n\r\na. _Coxa_ or _Clavicula_[2001]. The _coxa_ is the joint that connects\r\nthe leg with the trunk of the insect. With regard to their _shape_,\r\nthe most general form of the four anterior is more or less that\r\nof a truncated cone: in the _Staphylinidæ_, however, they tend\r\nto a pyramidal or four-sided figure; as do the whole six in the\r\n_Trichoptera_: in numbers of the weevils and capricorns they are\r\nsubglobose; in the Lamellicorns they are mostly oblong, and not\r\nprominent: the posterior pair in the _Coleoptera_ are generally flat\r\nand placed in a transverse position, and more or less oblong and\r\nquadrangular: in _Elater_, &c., they are cuneiform: in _Haliplus_\r\nLatr. they are dilated, and cover the thigh[2002]: in _Buprestis_,\r\n_Copris_, &c., they have a cavity that partly receives it: the\r\ncorresponding part, the _clavicle_, in the _arm_ of _Gryllotalpa_,\r\nis very large and remarkable; viewed underneath it is triangular,\r\nand trifid where the trochanter articulates with it: in that of\r\n_Megachile Willughbiella_ the clavicle is armed with a spine[2003].\r\nAs to their _proportions_, the most general law seems to be, that the\r\nanterior pair shall be the shortest and smallest, and the posterior\r\nthe longest and largest. In some instances, as in _Buprestis_, the\r\ntwo anterior pair are nearly equal; in others (_Mantis_, _Eurhinus_\r\nK.), the anterior are the longest, in the former as long as the\r\nthigh, and the four posterior the shortest: in the _Trichoptera_,\r\n_Lepidoptera_, &c., all are nearly equal; in _Mantis_ the two\r\n_posterior_, and in _Phengodes_ the _intermediate_ pair are the\r\nlargest; but in _Necrophorus_ they are the smallest:--though almost\r\nuniversally without articulations, in _Galeodes_ the clavicle\r\nconsists of _two_ and the coxa of _three_[2004].\r\n\r\nb. _Trochanter_ or _Scapula_[2005]. This is the _second_ joint of the\r\nleg: and if the _coxa_ is regarded as the analogue of the _thigh_\r\nin vertebrate animals, this should seem to represent the _patella_\r\nor _rotula_, vulgarly called the knee-pan. Latreille and Dr. Virey\r\nconsider this articulation as merely a joint of the _coxa_[2006]; but\r\nif closely examined, especially in Coleopterous insects, you will\r\nfind it so fixed to the thigh as scarcely to have separate motion\r\nfrom it, and in many cases it seems to be merely its fulcrum; but\r\nI am not aware that any instance occurs in which it has not motion\r\nseparate from that of the former joint.\r\n\r\nAs to its _articulation_ with the _coxa_,--in the _Coleoptera_ it\r\nappears to be of a mixed kind; for it inosculates in that joint,\r\nis suspended by ligament to its orifice, and its protuberances are\r\nreceived by corresponding cavities in it; and its cavities receive\r\nprotuberances, which belongs to a ginglymous articulation. I have\r\nobserved two variations in this Order, in one of which the motion\r\nof the thigh and trochanter is only in _two_ directions, and in the\r\nother it is nearly _versatile_ or rotatory. The _Lamellicorns_ afford\r\nan example of the first, and the _Rhyncophorous_ beetles or weevils\r\nof the second. If you extract from the _coxa_ the thigh with the\r\ntrochanter of the larger species of _Dynastes_ M^cL., you will find\r\nthat the head of the latter is divided into two obtuse incurving\r\nlobes or condyles: that on the inner side being the smallest and\r\nshortest, and constricted just below its apex: and that under\r\nthis is a shallow or glenoid cavity, terminating posteriorly in a\r\nlubricous flat curvilinear ridge. If you next examine the trochanter\r\nin articulation with the coxa, you will perceive that the head of\r\nthe former inosculates in it, that the lower condyle is received\r\nby a sinus of the coxa, which also has a lubricous _very_ shallow\r\ncavity corresponding with the ridge, in which it turns; and in the\r\nhead of the coxa, on the lower side, is an external condyle, which\r\nis received by a sinus common to both, of the head of the thigh and\r\nof the exterior side of the trochanter[2007], in which it likewise\r\nturns: this last condyle has also an internal protuberance, which\r\nappears to ginglymate with a cavity of the trochanter: from this\r\nstructure the leg is limited chiefly to a motion up and down upon two\r\npivots, or to fold and extend itself. You will find an articulation\r\nvery near this, but on a smaller scale, in the stag-beetle. In the\r\nother kind of articulation, which admits of freer motion, the head\r\nof the trochanter is prolonged, and the process terminates in a\r\nshort interior condyle, which appears to work in a corresponding\r\ncavity of the interior of the coxa; and the base of the process is\r\nencompassed by a ridge with a cavity behind it, which is received by\r\nanother of the lower part of that piece, and admits a corresponding\r\nridge--a structure that allows a rotatory motion. In the hind-legs of\r\nthis tribe the motion is chiefly limited to folding and extending;\r\nin _Carabus_, &c., also the head of the trochanter is nearly\r\nhemispherical, and the articulation approaches ball and socket.\r\nIn most of the other Orders, the _Hymenoptera_ excepted, there is\r\nlittle or no inosculation, the trochanter being simply suspended by\r\nligament to the _coxa_ as well as to the _thigh_; its connection\r\nwith the latter is similar in _Coleoptera_; but in _Cicindela_, &c.,\r\nit inosculates in it. The part we are considering varies in its\r\nposition with respect to the thigh: in the hind-legs of _Carabus_,\r\n&c., it forms a lateral fulcrum on the inner side of that part, and\r\ndoes not intervene between its base and the coxa; the muscles from\r\nthe latter entering the former, not at the bottom of the base, but\r\nat its side: but in the four anterior legs it forms their base, as\r\nit does in all the legs in _Apion_, and in all the Orders except the\r\n_Coleoptera_, cutting them entirely off from contact with the coxa:\r\nin the _Lamellicorns_ they cut off part of the base obliquely, but so\r\nas to permit their coming in contact with the condyle of the coxa, as\r\nbefore mentioned. In the _Ichneumonidæ_ and some other _Hymenoptera_\r\nthe _trochanter_ appears to consist of _two_ joints particularly\r\nvisible in the posterior legs[2008].\r\n\r\nAs to _size_ in general,--the part in question is smaller than the\r\ncoxa; but in _Notonecta_ it is larger, and in the dog-tick (_Ixodes\r\nRicinus_) longer than that joint. It exhibits few variations in its\r\n_shape_ or _appendages_ worthy of particular notice. In general,\r\nin the _Coleoptera_ it is triangular or trigonal; but in _Carabus_\r\nL., in the hind-leg it is oblong or rather kidney-shaped; in that\r\nof _Necrophorus_[2009] it terminates in one or two teeth or spines,\r\nvarying in length in the different species: in the other Orders it is\r\nnot remarkable in this respect.\r\n\r\nc. _Femur_ or _Humerus_[2010]. The _femur_ or thigh is the _third_,\r\nand usually the largest and most conspicuous joint of the leg. In\r\nthe hypothesis before alluded to[2011] it is considered as the\r\nanalogue of the _tibia_ of vertebrate animals. With regard to\r\nthe _articulation_ of this part with the trochanter, it has been\r\nsufficiently explained under that head, and that with the _tibia_\r\nI shall treat of when I come to that joint. As to the _size_ of\r\nthe thighs, and their relative _proportions_ to each other and to\r\nthe remaining joints of the leg, the most general law is, that\r\nthe _anterior_ pair shall be the _shortest_ and _smallest_, and\r\nthe _posterior_ the _longest_ and _largest_. With respect to the\r\nremaining articulations, most commonly the _thigh_ is longer and\r\nlarger than the _tibia_, and the _tibia_ than the _tarsus_. But there\r\nare numerous exceptions to both these rules. With respect to the\r\n_first_, we may begin by observing that the increase of the magnitude\r\nof the thigh, from the anterior to the posterior pair, is usually\r\n_gradual_: but in many jumping insects, and likewise many that do\r\nnot jump, the posterior pair are _suddenly_ and disproportionally\r\nthicker than the rest[2012]. Again, in many insects the _anterior_\r\npair are the _longest_ and _thickest_, as in _Macropus longimanus_,\r\n_Bibio_, _Nabis_, &c.: in others, the _intermediate_ exceed the rest\r\nin _magnitude_, as in _Onitis Aygulus_, _cupreus_; _Sicus flavipes_,\r\n&c.; in many Lamellicorns _all_ the thighs are incrassated and nearly\r\nequal in size: but in some, as _Ryssonotus nebulosus_ M^cL.[2013],\r\nthe _intermediate_ pair are rather smaller than the rest. With\r\nrespect to the _second_ rule--in some, as in the male of _Macropus\r\nlongimanus_, the _anterior tibia_, though more slender, is longer\r\nthan the _thigh_; in _Hololepta maxillosa_ it is longer and more\r\ndilated; in _Lamia marmorata_, or one related to it from Brazil, the\r\n_intermediate_ pair are longer; in _Ateuchus gibbus_ and others of\r\nthat tribe the _posterior thighs_ are smaller than the _tibiæ_: and,\r\nto mention no more; in _Callichroma latipes_ the _posterior_ tibia\r\nis wider than the part last named. Again, the _tarsi_ are as long\r\nas either _tibia_ or _thigh_ in many of the larger _Dynastidæ_, as\r\n_Megasoma Actæon_, &c.; longer than either in _Melolontha subspinosa_\r\nF.; and in _Tiphia_, _Scolia_ and affinities, often as long, or\r\nlonger than both together.\r\n\r\nAs to _shape_,--the _thigh_, especially in the fore-leg, varies\r\nconsiderably: most generally it is flat, linear, and a little thicker\r\nwhere it is united to the _tibia_, on the outer side convex, and\r\nconcave next the body; but in many it is gradually thicker from the\r\nbase to the apex: in some _Cerambyces_ (_C. thoracicus_) it is clavate;\r\nin others of this genus and _Molorchus_ they may be called capitate;\r\nin _Pterostichus_ they are rather lanceolate; in _Onitis Sphinx_\r\nthe humerus is triangular, and the intermediate thigh rhomboidal;\r\nin _Bruchus Bactris_ it is bent like a bow; and in some Brazilian\r\n_Halticæ_ it is nearly semicircular. The _humerus_ in _Phasma_ is\r\nattenuated at the base; in _Empusa gongyloides_ it is at first\r\novato-lanceolate, and terminates below in a kind of footstalk[2014];\r\nin _Phasma flabelliforme_ it is dolabriform[2015]; in _Mantis_ often\r\nsemioval or semielliptical, and thickest at the inner edge, which\r\naffords space for two rows of spines with which it is planted. In\r\n_Phyllium siccifolium_ all the thighs are furnished on both sides\r\nwith a foliaceous appendage nearly from base to apex[2016]: in a\r\nspecies of _Empusa_ (_E. macroptera_), the four posterior ones are so\r\ndistinguished only on their posterior side[2017]: others of this last\r\ngenus, as _E. gongyloides_, have an alary appendage on _both_ sides at\r\nthe apex of these thighs[2018]; and another family, as _E. pauperata_,\r\nhave only one on the _posterior_ side[2019]. The thighs of no insect\r\nare more remarkable for their elegant shape,--tapering gradually from\r\nthe base to the apex, where they swell again into a kind of knee,--than\r\nthe posterior ones of the locusts (_Locusta_ Leach); each side of\r\nthese thighs is strengthened with three longitudinal nearly parallel\r\nridges, and the upper and under sides are adorned by a double series,\r\nin some coalescing as they approach the tibia, of oblique quadrangular\r\nelevations resembling scales[2020].\r\n\r\nI shall next say a few words upon the _spines_ and other _processes_\r\nwhich arm the thigh. Those moveable ones of _Mantis_ which help to\r\nform a fearful instrument of destruction, have just been mentioned,\r\nand similar ones, but less conspicuous, arm the intermediate thighs\r\nof _Sicus flavipes_: other appendages of this kind are for a less\r\ndestructive purpose--to keep the tibia when folded in its place. This\r\nseems to be the use of the serratures and spine that arm the thigh of\r\n_Bruchus Bactris_, or the Hymenopterous genera _Leucospis_, _Chalcis_,\r\n&c.; in _Onitis Aygulus_ a short filiform horn arms the humerus, and\r\na longer crooked one that of many species of _Scaurus_[2021]. In many\r\n_Stenocori_ the thighs terminate in two spines, and in _Gonyleptes_\r\nK. the posterior ones are armed internally with very strong ones;\r\nwith which, as the legs converge at their knee[2022], they may\r\nprobably detain their prey. The knee-pan (_Gonytheca_) of the thigh,\r\nor the cavity at its end, which receives the head of the _tibia_,\r\nis very conspicuous in the weevils; but in no insects more than in\r\n_Locusta_[2023], in which tribe it deserves your particular attention.\r\n\r\nd. _Tibia_ or _Cubitus_[2024]. The _tibia_ or shank is the _fourth_\r\njoint of the leg, which according to the hypothesis lately alluded\r\nto is the analogue, in the _anterior_ leg of the _carpus_ or carpal\r\nbones, and in the _four posterior_ ones of the _tarsus_ or tarsal\r\nbones of vertebrate animals. This may be called the most conspicuous\r\nof the articulations of the leg; for though it is generally more\r\nslender and often shorter than the thigh, it falls more under the eye\r\nof the observer, that joint being more or less concealed by the body:\r\nit consists in general of a single joint; but in the _Araneidæ_ and\r\n_Phalangidæ_ it has an accessory one, often incrassated at its base,\r\nwhich I have named the _Epicnemis_[2025].\r\n\r\nWith respect to the _articulation_ of the _tibia_ with the thigh--we\r\nmay observe that in general it is by means of _three_ processes or\r\ncondyles, two lateral and one intermediate, of the head of the former\r\njoint[2026]: the lateral ones are usually received by a cavity or\r\nsinus of the _gonytheca_ of the thigh[2027]; and upon these the\r\n_tibia_ turns, with a semirotatory motion up and down as upon a\r\npair of pivots: at the same time the _mola_ or head of the latter\r\njoint, which has often a flexure so as to form an elbow with the\r\nrest of it, inosculates in the _gonytheca_, and is also suspended\r\nby ligament to the orifice through which the muscles, nerves, and\r\nbronchiæ are transmitted: so that in fact the articulation, strictly\r\nspeaking, belongs exclusively to none of the kinds observable in\r\nvertebrate animals, but partakes of several, and may properly be\r\ndenominated a _mixed_ articulation,--a term applicable in numerous\r\ninstances also to the other articulations of the legs of insects.\r\nIn the different Orders some variations in this respect take\r\nplace,--I will notice some of the most remarkable. In no Coleopterous\r\ninsects is the structure more distinctly visible than in the larger\r\nLamellicorns. In _Copris bucephalus_, for instance, if you divide\r\nthe thigh longitudinally, you will find on each side, at the head,\r\nthat it is furnished with a nearly hemispherical protuberance,\r\nperforated in the centre for the transmission of muscles, and\r\nsurrounded externally by a ridge, leaving a semicircular cavity\r\nbetween them[2028]: if you next examine the _tibia_, after having\r\nextracted it, you will find on each side, at the base, a cavity\r\ncorresponding with the protuberance of the thigh which it receives,\r\nhaving likewise a central orifice, and surrounded by a semicircular\r\nridge corresponding with the cavity in the thigh in which it acts:\r\nbelow this ridge another cavity, forming a small segment of a\r\ncircle, receives the ridge of the thigh[2029]. You will observe that\r\nthe ridge of the _tibia_ represents the lateral condyle lately\r\nnoticed: in the _Dynastidæ_ this is more prominent, and often forms\r\na smaller segment of a circle. In these also the protuberance of\r\nthe thigh is more minute, and its ridge is received by a cavity of\r\nthe _tibia_ nearly semicircular[2030]; in _Geotrupes_ Latr. the\r\narticulation is not very different, though on a reduced scale; in\r\n_Calandra Palmarum_ the lateral condyles of the _tibiæ_ are flatter\r\nand broader[2031]; and the articulation not being quite so complex,\r\nthis joint is kept steady by an intermediate process observable in\r\nthe _gonytheca_[2032]. From the above description it appears that\r\nthe dislocation of the _tibia_ is effectually prevented in the\r\nLamellicorns by the protuberance and ridge of the thigh working\r\nin their corresponding cavities, while the condyle of that part\r\nturns with a rotatory motion in the cavity of the thigh. In the\r\n_Orthoptera_ Order the _tibia_ is suspended by a ligament, in the\r\n_gonytheca_ the lateral condyles, which are very prominent, working\r\nin a sinus of that part[2033]. The subsequent Orders exhibit no\r\nvery striking variations from these types of articulation, I shall\r\ntherefore not detain you longer upon this head.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _proportions_ and _magnitude_ of the joint we\r\nare considering,--the most general law is, that the _anterior_ pair\r\nshould be shorter and more slender than the _intermediate_; and\r\nthe _intermediate_ than the _posterior_; and that all the _tibiæ_\r\nshould be shorter and more slender than the _thighs_, and longer\r\nand thicker than the _tarsi_. Various exceptions, however, to this\r\nrule in all these cases might be produced; but I shall only observe\r\nthat in all those insects in which the fore-legs are calculated for\r\ndigging or seizing their prey, as in the _Petalocerous_ beetles, the\r\n_Gryllotalpa_, _Mantis_, &c., this joint of the leg is usually much\r\nenlarged and more conspicuous than the others.\r\n\r\nAs to its _figure_ and _shape_--most commonly the _tibia_\r\ngrows thicker from the base to the apex, as in the majority of\r\n_Coleoptera_, _Hymenoptera_, &c.; in the _Orthoptera_, _Neuroptera_,\r\n&c., it is generally equally thick every where. Another peculiarity\r\nrelating to this head observable in it, is its tendency to a trigonal\r\nfigure: this, however, though very general, is not universal;--thus,\r\nin some _Orthoptera_, as _Pterophylla_ K., its horizontal section is\r\nquadrangular; in others, as _Locusta_ Leach and many other insects,\r\nit is nearly a circle; in some scorpions it is almost a hexagon. The\r\nsuperficial shape also of this joint in numerous instances is more or\r\nless triangular, but it sometimes recedes from this form:--thus, in\r\n_Callichroma latipes_ it is a segment of a circle; in some _Empides_\r\nit is clavate; in _Onitis Sphinx_, dolabriform; in the _Orthoptera_,\r\n_Neuroptera_, &c., it is usually linear; in some _Lygæi_ it is\r\nangular[2034]: but the most remarkable _tibiæ_ in this respect are\r\nthose of such species of this last genus as have the posterior\r\nones winged or foliaceous, so that they resemble the leaf of some\r\nplant--the _tibia_ being the _rachis_, and the _wing_ (which in some\r\nspecies is veined) representing the _leaf_ itself. This structure\r\nis exemplified in _Lygæus compressipes_, _phyllopus_, _foliaceus_,\r\n&c.[2035] Under this head I must say a few words upon the _flexure_\r\nof this joint, which in some cases merits notice. I have before\r\nmentioned its bend at the knee[2036] or base: the apex also is\r\nsometimes incurved--in the anterior one of the male of _Macropus\r\nlongimanus_ so as almost to form a hook[2037]: in _Lygæus Pharaonis_\r\nthe posterior pair are flexuose[2038]; in _Bruchus Bactris_,\r\n_Leucospis_, and several species of _Chalcis_, these _tibiæ_ curve\r\nso as to adapt themselves to the bend of the thigh when folded. The\r\nnotch on the inside of the anterior pair, in a large majority of\r\n_Carabus_ L., armed above by a spur[2039], a structure which probably\r\nassists them in seizing and detaining their prey, may also here be\r\nintroduced: in the generality it is a little removed from the apex of\r\nthe joint in question; but in _Pamborus_ it is very near to it, and\r\nin _Cychrus_, _Carabus_, &c., it becomes obsolete. I may mention here\r\nalso a singular character which distinguishes the cubit of both sexes\r\nof _Gryllus campestris_, _domesticus_, &c. At the base there is an\r\naperture which passes through the joint--anteriorly it is oval, and\r\nposteriorly elliptical and much larger, and on both sides is closed\r\nby a tense membrane.\r\n\r\nThe most striking peculiarities as to the _clothing_ of his joint have\r\nbeen chiefly noticed under the sexual characters of insects[2040],\r\nbut some appear not to be of that description. In _Sphæridium_ Leach,\r\nwhile the thighs and _tarsi_ are naked, the posterior _tibiæ_ are\r\nremarkably beset with stiff bristles; in _Empis pennipes_ they are\r\nthickly fringed on both sides; in _Scarabæus_ M^cL. only externally,\r\nand in _Dytiscus serricornis_ internally; in _Necydalis barpipes_ K.\r\nthis fringe is longer at the apex; and in _Saperda hirtipes_ Ol. the\r\nsame _tibiæ_ at that part are adorned with a large brush, like that\r\nobservable in the antennæ of some _Lamiæ_[2041].\r\n\r\nI must next call your attention to the _teeth_, _spines_, and _spurs_\r\nwith which the _tibiæ_ of insects are sometimes armed. With regard\r\nto _teeth_, you have doubtless often observed those that distinguish\r\nthe _cubitus_ of the arm of most Lamellicorn beetles: these vary\r\nin number from _one_, as in _Trox suberosus_, to _seven_, as in\r\n_Geotrupes autumnalis_; but the most universal number is _three_:\r\nin some species of _Geotrupes_, as _G. stercorarius_, &c., the\r\n_third_ tooth from the apex, and those that follow it, may be called\r\n_double_. These teeth, in their cubit or anterior shank, doubtless\r\nassist these insects in burrowing. The four posterior _tibiæ_ in\r\nthis tribe are also distinguished by a kind of teeth which occupy\r\ntheir whole diameter, and resemble so many steps. I have before\r\nnoticed the remarkable cubit of the _Gryllotalpa_, and likewise that\r\nof _Scarites_, _Pasimachus_, &c., in which some of the teeth are\r\nprolonged into _spines_[2042], which are the next description of\r\ntibial arms that I mentioned. Spines are of _two_ kinds--those which\r\nare merely _processes_ of the crust of the _tibia_, and those that\r\nare _implanted_ in it, and seem to have a _gomphosis_ or perhaps an\r\n_amphiarthrosis_ articulation[2043]. An instance of the _first_ kind\r\nmay be seen in the hind-legs of some grasshoppers[2044] (_Locusta_\r\nLeach), the _Rutelidæ_, &c. though in others they are implanted:--of\r\nthe _second_, in the _cubitus_ of the _Mantidæ_, and of _all_ the\r\n_tibiæ_ of the dragon-flies (_Libellulina_ M^cL.)[2045];--and of\r\n_both_ kinds in the hind-legs of _Acrida_ K., those which arm the\r\nupper angles of the tibiæ being _processes_, and those of the lower\r\nbeing _implanted_. The term _spine_ I think ought to be restricted\r\nto the first kind; the _second_ ought rather to be denominated\r\n_spurs_ (_calcaria_), and may perhaps be regarded as in some degree\r\nsynonymous with those most important appendages of the joint in\r\nquestion, that are implanted in or near their apex, which have been\r\nhitherto distinguished by this last denomination, and which I am\r\nnext to consider. But though I have not altered a term generally\r\nadopted, I must here express my opinion that they ought rather to be\r\nconsidered as minute _toes_ or _fingers_, and that the denomination\r\nbest agreeing with their functions, as accessories to the main toe,\r\nwould be _digituli_: this is proved particularly by a character\r\npeculiar to those of many species of the genus _Cimbex_ amongst the\r\nsaw-flies, in which these organs are furnished with a _sucker_ or\r\n_pulvillus_ (as they are also in _Œnas_ a kind of blister beetle),\r\nas well as the joints of the tarsi[2046]; which makes it evident\r\nthat they are applied by the animal to surfaces, and assist it in\r\nwalking or climbing; and in general it may be observed that in most\r\ninsects their principal use is connected with these motions, and with\r\nburrowing. This circumstance tends to prove that the generality of\r\ninsects (for all have not these organs) have really a didactyle or\r\ntridactyle hand or foot; and the hypothesis so often alluded to--that\r\nthe _cubitus_ or _tibia_, &c., is really analogous to the _carpus_\r\nor _tarsus_ in vertebrate animals[2047]--seems to receive no small\r\nconfirmation from it; since, if the _spurs_ be really analogous to\r\n_fingers_ or _toes_, the part they articulate with cannot be the\r\n_tibia_, &c. Though the parts in question did not escape the notice\r\nof Reaumur, Linné, De Geer, Latreille, &c., yet they have not been\r\nemployed in the determination of tribes, genera, &c., except by the\r\nauthor last named, but perhaps adopted from Bonelli[2048], in the\r\nsubgenera _Zabrus_ and _Pelorus_: in many instances, however, they\r\nafford excellent subsidiary characters, sometimes common to a whole\r\nOrder, and at others distinguishing its various subdivisions. With\r\nregard to their _number_--I have noticed many variations which I\r\nwill now state to you, first observing that I shall express them by\r\n_three_ figures, the _first_ representing the number of spurs on the\r\n_anterior_ leg, the _second_ that of those on the _intermediate_,\r\nand the _third_ on the _posterior_; and where there are spurs, as in\r\nthe _Trichoptera_ and _Lepidoptera_, on the _middle_ as well as at\r\nthe _end_ of the _tibia_, I shall express it by one figure _over_\r\nanother, the upper one representing the number of the _middle_ spurs.\r\nIf you make an examination yourself, it will be proper to remind\r\nyou that these little organs are extremely liable to be broken off,\r\nbut the socket in which they were planted is usually very visible.\r\nThe most _natural_ number is represented by 2:2:2; this you will\r\nfind very prevalent in the _Coleoptera_ Order, as in the Predaceous\r\nand numerous other beetles: in the _Orthoptera_ and _Hemiptera_\r\nOrders, however, I have not discovered an instance of it; but in\r\nall the rest it more or less occurs: next to this number--_tibiæ_\r\nwith obsolete or no spurs seem most prevalent, particularly in the\r\n_Hemiptera_; not a single instance of an insect furnished with them\r\noccurring to me in the _Heteropterous_ section; and it is doubtful\r\nwhether there are any in the _Homopterous_.--Having stated the most\r\nuniversal structure in this respect, I will next consider the Orders\r\nseriatim. Amongst the _Coleoptera_ though the numbers 2:2:2 are most\r\nfrequent in occurrence, yet there are numerous exceptions. Thus, in\r\nthe Lamellicorns, 1:1:1 represents the _calcaria_ of one tribe of\r\nthe _Scarabæidæ_ M^cL. formed of the genus _Scarabæus_ M^cL.; 1:2:1\r\nrepresents those of another tribe of that family, including the\r\nsubgenera _Ateuchus_, _Copris_, _Phanæus_, &c.; 1:2:2 again forms\r\nthe character in this respect of _Aphodius_ and the great majority\r\nof the Lamellicorns; while 2:2:2 is confined in this section to\r\n_Æsalus_ F. and _Melolontha chrysomeloides_ Schranck (_Psephus_\r\nM^cL. MS.). In the other tribes of _Coleoptera_ other numbers occur.\r\nThus, 0:1:1 characterizes _Hylœcetus_; 0:1:2 _Mordella_; 0:2:2\r\n_Macropus_; 1/1:2:2 _Harpalus_, and all those _Carabi_ L., except\r\n_Zabrus_, that have a _notch_ in their anterior _tibiæ_; 1/2:2:2\r\n_Zabrus_. In the _Orthoptera_ Order it is not easy to distinguish\r\nthe real _spurs_ from the implanted _spines_ that frequently arm\r\nthe legs: these in _Blatta_ are extremely numerous, even at the\r\napex of the _tibiæ_; but I cannot distinguish any that can be\r\nregarded as true analogues of the former: the most natural number\r\nof spurs in this Order is represented by 0:0:4; this you will see\r\nin all the Locusts; in _Acrida_, _Conocephala_, _Pterophylla_; and\r\nin _Truxalis_, _Pneumora_, &c.; in _Phasma_ there are none. In\r\n_Mantis_, if the terminal process of the _cubitus_ is excluded,\r\nit will be 0:2:2; in _Gryllotalpa_, admitting the terminal teeth\r\nof that part[2049] as analogues of spurs, the number is 4:4:4;\r\nin _Tridactylus_ Latr. 0:0:5[2050]; in _Gryllus_ Latr. 3:3:5; in\r\n_Gryllus monstrosus_, 4:4:6. In the whole _Hemiptera_ Order I have\r\ndiscovered no instance of an insect furnished with the real spurs:\r\nfor though in _Tettigonia_ F., _Cercopis_, &c., there are implanted\r\nspines in the posterior _tibia_, and several at the apex, there are\r\nnone of them clearly analogous to real spurs. In the _Lepidoptera_\r\nthe most general arrangement appears to be 1/0:2:2/2; and next to\r\nthis, 1/0:2:2. In this Order most commonly there is no spur at the\r\nend of the cubit, but one resembling a thumb[2051] arms its middle;\r\nin _Pieris_, &c., this thumb is not present, so that the number is\r\n0:2:2; in _Agarista_ Leach, _Erebus_, &c., you will find 1/0:2:4,\r\nthe posterior _calcaria_ being all terminal; and in _Attacus Atlas_,\r\nall these organs are obsolete except the thumb. In the _Neuroptera_\r\nthe most general arrangement is 2:2:2; but in the _Libellulina_,\r\nalthough the legs are very spinose, there are no spurs. In the\r\n_Trichoptera_ K., in _Phryganea rhombica_ and affinities, the number\r\nof them is expressed by 1/2:1/2:1/2; and in those with long antennæ,\r\n_P. atra_, &c., by 2/2:2/2:2/2. In the _Hymenoptera_ the number 1:2:2\r\nis most prevalent; and next to this, as in _Apis_ L., 1:1:2. In the\r\n_Ichneumones minuti_ L. the spurs are 1:1:1; in _Atta_ Latreille, a\r\nkind of ant[2052], 1:0:0. In the _Diptera_ it is often difficult to\r\ndistinguish the spurs from the spines; but the number most universal\r\nis, I think, 2:2:2; in _Tipula_ it is 1:2:2; in the _Tabanidæ_ 0:2:0;\r\nand in _Culex_, _Limonia_, &c., there are none. Amongst the insects\r\nwith more than six legs, most commonly the tibiæ have no spurs; but\r\nin the _Araneidæ_ each is armed with _two_, a circumstance which also\r\ndistinguishes the corresponding joint of the _pedipalpi_.\r\n\r\nThese little organs inosculate each in an appropriate socket of the\r\nend, or in many cases of the middle of the _tibia_; and that part\r\nof their head or base that is received by it, is often constricted\r\nfor the purpose: from hence it follows that they are capable of some\r\ndegree of motion, but in some insects, as those on the four posterior\r\nlegs of _Scarabæus sacer_ and its more immediate affinities, and\r\nthose at the end of the cubit of _Gryllotalpa_, they are immoveable,\r\nand appear almost processes of the joint to which they belong. They\r\nare commonly sharp, of a subtriquetrous figure, with the lower side\r\nflat: where there are two, the outer one is usually the longest; and\r\nin general the spurs on the hind legs are longer than those on the\r\nfour anterior: but there are exceptions--thus, in _Acanthopus_ Latr.\r\nthe _intermediate_ spurs are the longest; and in _Cicindela_ the\r\n_anterior_ are longer than the former; in _Blaps mortisaga_ those\r\non all the legs are nearly equal in length. They vary sometimes in\r\n_shape_--those on the middle of the cubit of many _Lepidoptera_,\r\nwhich may be regarded as a kind of thumb[2053], are of a lanceolate\r\nshape; in _Meloe_ the external posterior one is flat and obtuse;\r\nin _Œnas_ Latr. it is obconical, concave at the extremity, and\r\napparently furnished with a sucker; in _Ateuchus smaragdulus_ the\r\n_anterior_, and in _Copris Carolina_ the _posterior_ is forked and\r\nemarginate; in _Sirex_ the former is hooked and winged; in _Lamprima_\r\nit is triangular and dilated; in _Aphodius analis_ it is dolabriform;\r\nin _Dynastes retusus_ and _Juvencus_ the spurs are bent like a bow.\r\nIn many _Hymenoptera_, as the _Sphecidæ_, they are pectinated[2054],\r\nwith a series of minute parallel spines--a structure which assists\r\nthe animal in burrowing[2055]; in _Acanthopus_ Latr. they are armed\r\nwith little teeth or spines[2056]; in the hive bee the spur of the\r\ncubit is furnished with a membranous appendage which I have called\r\nthe velum[2057]; and in a subgenus related to _Saropoda_ Latr.\r\n(_Ctenoplectra_ K. MS.), the interior spur of the posterior leg is\r\ncrescent-shaped, fixed transversely, and fitted on the inner side\r\nwith a membrane, the edge of which is finally pectinated.\r\n\r\ne. _Tarsus_ or _Manus_[2058]. This is the _last_ portion of the leg,\r\nusually supposed to be analogous to the hand or foot of vertebrate\r\nanimals; but, according to the hypothesis so often alluded to, rather\r\nthe representative of their jointed finger or toe. In treating of\r\nthis part I shall consider its _articulation_ with the _tibia_,\r\nand of its joints _inter se_; the _number_ of those joints; their\r\n_proportion_ and _shape_; their _parts_ and _appendages_.\r\n\r\nI seem to have observed _three_ kinds of tarsal _articulation_. The\r\n_first_ is a species of _enarthrosis_ or ball and socket, the joints\r\nterminating in a globular head, perforated indeed for the transmission\r\nof muscles, &c., and which is received by a corresponding cavity of the\r\n_tibia_ or preceding joint, as may be seen in many weevils (_Curculio_\r\nL.[2059]). This admits of some rotatory motion.--The _second_ is a\r\n_mixed_ articulation between _enarthrosis_ and _ginglymus_, when at the\r\nbase of the ball a deep transverse channel receives a corresponding\r\nridge of the _tibiæ_ or preceding joint: this may be found in _Rutela_\r\nand probably many other Lamellicorn beetles; and something very similar\r\nin the Predaceous ones.--The _third_ kind is where there is little or\r\nno inosculation, and the joints are scarcely more than _suspended_:\r\nthis takes place in the _Orthoptera_, _Neuroptera_, &c.; but in\r\n_Blatta_ and the hind legs of _Mantis_ there is some approach to the\r\nforegoing kinds.\r\n\r\nWe are now to consider the _number_ of joints of the _tarsus_, which\r\nvaries considerably in the different Orders, and in one has been\r\nassumed as a clue for a subdivision of it into sections[2060], which,\r\nthough not perfectly natural, is very convenient, and has been adopted\r\nby most modern Entomologists. In treating of this head, I shall use\r\nthose denominations that have been employed by M. Latreille and others\r\nto express the variations of the number of the tarsal joints in the\r\n_Coleoptera_, but shall apply them to insects in general. Insects in\r\nthis view, therefore, may be called _pentamerous_; _heteromerous_;\r\n_tetramerous_; _trimerous_; _dimerous_; or _monomerous_.\r\n\r\n_Pentamerous_ insects are those which have _five_ joints in _all_\r\ntheir _tarsi_. This is the most universal, and may be called the\r\n_natural_ number of these joints. More than half the _Coleoptera_\r\nbelong to this section; in the _Orthoptera_--the _Blattidæ_, _Mantidæ_,\r\nand _Phasmidæ_; all the _Lepidoptera_ except those butterflies called\r\n_tetrapi_ (_Vanessa_, &c.); all the _Trichoptera_, _Hymenoptera_,\r\nand _Diptera_; in the _Neuroptera_--_Ascalaphus_, _Myrmeleon_,\r\n_Hemerobius_, _Corydalis_, &c.; and in the _Aptera_--_Pulex_[2061].\r\n\r\n_Heteromerous_ insects are those in which the number of these joints\r\nvaries in the different pairs of legs[2062]. These variations, like\r\nthe spurs, may be expressed by three figures, the first representing\r\nthe _anterior tarsus_, the second the _intermediate_, and the third\r\nthe _posterior_. I begin with 5:5:4. This number represents those\r\nbeetles that have been _exclusively_ regarded as _heteromerous_ by\r\nmodern Entomologists--of this description is the Linnean _Tenebrio_,\r\n_Meloe_, &c., now subdivided into numerous genera; they have _five_\r\njoints in the two anterior pair, and _four_ in the posterior. The\r\ntarsal joints of the aquatic genus _Hydroporus_ (a singular anomaly\r\nin the Order to which they belong) are expressed by 4:4:5, thus\r\nreversing the number in the preceding tribe: other Heteromerous\r\ngenera are to be found amongst the _Hemiptera_. Thus, in _Ranatra_\r\nthe numbers are 2:1:1; in _Sigara_ and _Nauceris_ 1:2:2; in a new\r\nsubgenus between _Belostoma_ and _Naucoris_ (_Xiphostoma_ K. MS.),\r\nbrought by Dr. Bigsby from Canada, 3:2:2; in the _Lepidoptera_ the\r\nbutterflies called _tetrapi_ (_Vanessa_, &c.) may be expressed\r\nby 1:5:5. Amongst the _Aptera_ and _Arachnida_ there are three\r\nremarkable genera, which if their pedipalps are included may\r\nbe deemed Heteromerous. I mean _Phrynus_, _Thelyphena_, and\r\n_Galeodes_;--in the former the numbers will be *:4:4:4, the asterisk\r\ndenoting more than ten; in the second, 8:4:4:4.; and in _Galeodes_\r\n(in which the first pair of pedipalps are not chelate, the mandibles\r\nperforming their office) the numbers are 1:1:3:3:3.[2063]\r\n\r\n_Tetramerous_ insects are those in which all the _tarsi_ consist of\r\n_four_ joints; these in the _Coleoptera_ are next in number to the\r\n_pentamerous_--indeed a very large proportion of them strictly speaking\r\nare really of the latter description, since in Linné's four great\r\ngenera, _Curculio_, _Cerambyx_, _Chrysomela_, and _Cassida_ and some\r\nothers, the _claw-joint_ (_ungula_) consists of _two_ articulations,\r\none very short, forming merely the ball at its base[2064], which\r\ninosculates in the socket of the preceding joint, and the other\r\nconstituting the remainder: if you carefully separate these two pieces,\r\nyou will find that the last inosculates in the summit of the ball, and\r\nis moved by appropriate muscles[2065]. This structure probably permits\r\nthe readier elevation and depression of this joint. In the _Orthoptera_\r\nthe tetramerous genera are those which Linné called _Tettigonia_\r\namongst his _Grylli_ (_Locusta_ F.); _Acheta monstrosa_ also, and in\r\nthe _Neuroptera_, _Raphidia_ belong to this section.\r\n\r\n_Trimerous_ insects are those whose _tarsi_ consist of only _three_\r\njoints. Amongst beetles the Lady-birds (_Coccinella_ L.) are\r\nremarkable for this structure, but in them the claw-joint is also\r\n_biarticulate_, so that strictly speaking they are _tetramerous_;\r\nin the _Orthopterous_ Order the migratory locusts (_Locusta_ Leach)\r\nbelong to this section, as likewise _Gryllus_ Latr. and _Gryllotalpa_\r\nLatr.: in the first of these genera is an appearance of there being\r\nmore joints in the _tarsus_, because there is more than one cushion\r\nbelow the first[2066]. To this section also belong the great majority\r\nof the _Hemiptera_, excluding only those tribes that connect the two\r\nsections of the Order constituting the two Linnean genera _Nepa_ and\r\n_Notonecta_; the _Libellulina_ likewise belong here, as do also the\r\n_Scorpionidæ_ and _Scolopendridæ_.\r\n\r\n_Dimerous_ insects are those that have _two_ joints in all their\r\n_tarsi_. Such are the _Pselaphidæ_ in the Coleoptera Order[2067];\r\nin the _Hemiptera_--_Belostoma_ and _Notonecta_; in the hexapod\r\n_Aptera_--_Pediculus_; in the octopod--the _Acari_ of Linné; in the\r\nmyriapod--_Iulus_; and in the _Arachnida_--the _Araneidæ_.\r\n\r\n_Monomerous_ insects are those which have only a single tarsal\r\njoint. Only one Coleopterous and also one Hemipterous genus is so\r\ndistinguished: the first is _Dermestes Armadillus_ De Geer[2068], and\r\nthe second the common water-scorpion, _Nepa_ Latr. Among the _Aptera_\r\nwe find _Nirmus_, _Podura_, _Sminthurus_, &c., that belong to this\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nTo the above sections another may be added for those insects whose\r\n_tarsi_ have more than _five_ joints, which may be denominated\r\n_Polymerous_. Here belong the genera _Gonyleptes_ K., _Phalangium_\r\nand _Scutigera_ Latr. In the first the number of joints varies from\r\n_six_ to _eleven_, and in the two last they far exceed that number,\r\namounting in some species of _Phalangium_ to more than _fifty_, and\r\nbecoming convolute like the antennæ of Ichneumons[2069].\r\n\r\nI am next to notice the _proportions_ and _shape_ of the _tarsus_ and\r\nits joints. The most general law is, that it shall be shorter and more\r\nslender than the _tibia_; but it admits of several exceptions--thus,\r\nin _Megasoma_ K.[2070], in _all_ the legs; in _Agrostiphila_ M^cL.\r\nMS.[2071] in the _intermediate_, and in _Amphicoma lineata_ in the\r\n_posterior_ pair the _tarsi_ are the longest; in _Trichius Delta_\r\nthese last are longer than the thigh and _tibia_ together. In some\r\ninsects the _tarsi_ are disproportionally short, as in _Cassida_,\r\nthe _Pselaphidæ_, _Locusta_ Leach, &c. Though generally more slender\r\nthan the _tibia_, in several instances they are as thick or thicker,\r\nor more dilated, as in most of the tetramerous beetles, which being\r\nclimbers require a dilated _tarsus_. Again, comparing the three pairs\r\nof this joint with each other, the most general rule is, that the\r\n_anterior_ should be the _shortest_, and the _posterior_ the _longest_:\r\nbut in some, as the Capricorn beetles, &c., they are nearly equal in\r\nlength; in others, as _Lytta marginata_, the _anterior_ pair, and in\r\n_Rhipiphorus_ the _intermediate_, are the longest; in _Trichius Delta_\r\nthese last are the shortest. With respect to _thickness_, the anterior\r\n_tarsi_, except in many males[2072], are not very strikingly different\r\nfrom the rest.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the proportion of the joints of the _tarsus_ to each\r\nother,--according to the most general law, the first is the longest,\r\nthe last next in length, then the second and third, and the fourth is\r\nthe shortest. In _Gonyleptes_ K. and other _Phalangidæ_ the first is\r\nalmost thrice the length of all the rest taken together; but there\r\nare numerous exceptions to the rule. In the female _Carabi_ the first\r\njoint is not longer than the last, and in the males not so long; and\r\nin _Hydrophilus_, &c., it is the shortest of all. Again, the second\r\njoint is longer than the three following ones in _Dasytes ater_[2073];\r\nand than the last in _Cicindela sylvatica_: the _third_ joint is\r\nshorter than the fourth in _Lampyris ignita_: it is longer than the\r\nfirst in _Donacia_, many _Melolonthidæ_, &c. Once more, the _fourth_\r\njoint, usually the shortest of all, is longer than the second and\r\nthird in _Anthia_, &c. Lastly, the claw-joint, usually the second in\r\nlength, in the _Eproboscidea_ Latr. (_Hippobosca_ L.) is very long and\r\nlarge, while the four first joints are so extremely short as to be\r\nscarcely distinguishable from each other: it is the shortest of all in\r\n_Colymbetes_, &c.; it is of the length of the _third_ in _Cicindela\r\nsylvatica_, of the _fourth_ in _C. sexguttata_. Though commonly the\r\nslenderest joint of all, particularly so in _Raphidia_, in many\r\nHeteromerous and Lamellicorn beetles it is the largest, conspicuously\r\nso in _Mellinus tricinctus_. Sometimes, as in _Buprestis chrysis_, &c.,\r\nall the tarsal joints are nearly equal in length and thickness.\r\n\r\nWe are next to say something upon the _shape_ of the _tarsi_ and\r\ntheir joints. In general we may first observe that their upper\r\nsurface is commonly more or less convex, and the lower flat or\r\nconcave: in insects that are swift _runners_, as the terrestrial\r\nPredaceous beetles, they are usually slender and filiform[2074]; in\r\nthose that swim, as _Dytiscus_, the two posterior pair taper nearly\r\nto a point from the base to the apex[2075]; in some that climb,\r\nas _Buprestis_, they are rather flat and linear; and in others\r\n(the Weevils, _Curculio_ L.) they grow gradually wider towards\r\nthe claw-joint[2076]; sometimes, as in _Mordella_ Latr., the four\r\nanterior _tarsi_ are of this shape, and the posterior pair setaceous.\r\nIn _Gyrinus_ the four posterior are flat and triangular; and in that\r\nextraordinary insect _Gryllus monstrosus_ the _tarsi_ are foliaceous\r\nand lobed[2077]. In many males and some others the _anterior_ pair or\r\n_hands_ are of a different shape from the two _posterior_: thus, in\r\nseveral _Carabi_ they are lanceolate; in _Staphylinus_, _Creophilus_,\r\n&c. in both sexes they are often nearly circular, like those of male\r\n_Dytisci_[2078]. With regard to the _shape_ of individual joints\r\nit may be said in general that they are rather triangular, with\r\nan anterior sinus for the reception of the succeeding joint: the\r\nfirst joint usually departs most from this form; in the bees it is\r\ncommonly much larger than the rest, especially in the last pair of\r\nlegs, and nearly forming a parallelogram[2079]; in _Euglossa_ it is\r\ntrapezoidal; in the majority nearly linear or filiform. With regard\r\nto their _termination_--in _Brachycerus_ and some ants (_Ponera_,\r\n_Myrmica_, &c., Latr.) the _three first_ joints; in _Dascillus_,\r\n_Lycus reticulatus_ and affinities, the _third_ and _fourth_; and\r\nin the great majority of the Tetramerous insects the _penultimate_\r\njoint is bilobed; although in most Predaceous beetles this joint is\r\nentire or simply emarginate, yet in _Colliuris_ it terminates in a\r\nsingle oblique lobe; and in _Lebia_, _Drypta_, &c., it is nearly\r\nbipartite. I must now advert to the _Ungula_ or claw-joint: it\r\nis usually clavate or thickest at the end and curved; but in the\r\n_Asilidæ_ it is shaped like a vase or cup; in _Phanæus_, in the four\r\nposterior _tarsi_, in which the claws are obsolete, it is thickest\r\nat the base and sharpest at the extremity[2080]; it usually forms an\r\nangle with the rest of the _tarsus_, rising upwards, which enables\r\nthe insect to move more easily without hindrance from the claws,\r\nand also more readily to lay hold of any object it meets with; but\r\nin the Lamellicorn beetles and many other insects it is in the same\r\nline with it. As in the beetles last mentioned this joint is often\r\ninserted in the extremity of the preceding one; but in _Œdemera_ it\r\narticulates with the middle of its upper surface; and in _Lycus_ and\r\na numerous host of _Tetramerous_ beetles it springs from its base,\r\njust behind where it diverges into two lobes.\r\n\r\nI shall next call your attention to the different kinds of\r\n_appendages_ with which the _tarsi_ are furnished. They are\r\nseldom armed, like the _tibiæ_, with teeth, or spines, or horns;\r\nbut something of the kind occasionally distinguishes them. In\r\n_Phileurus_, _Oryctes_, and several other _Dynastidæ_, the first\r\njoint is armed at the apex externally with a considerable mucro; in\r\nthe fore-leg of _Dasytes ater_ a similar process is prolonged into a\r\ncrooked horn[2081]. But the most important appendages of the _tarsi_\r\nare the _claws_ which almost universally arm their extremity, and\r\nwhich appear clearly analogous to those of _birds_, _quadrupeds_,\r\n&c., though probably differing as to their substance[2082]. Some\r\nfew, however, are without them; this, as I lately observed, is the\r\ncase with _Phanæus_ with respect to the four _posterior_ legs; the\r\n_anterior_ ones of _Vanessa_ amongst the _Lepidoptera_, and all those\r\nof _Stylops_ and many _Acari_ L., are also without them: this is\r\nlikewise the case with the first pair of legs, or the second of the\r\npedipalps of _Galeodes_. In this genus these organs consist of two\r\njoints[2083]. With respect to _number_ they vary in different tribes,\r\nbut not so much as the _calcaria_: these variations may likewise be\r\nrepresented by three numbers. The most natural is _two_ in all the\r\n_tarsi_, exhibited by the Predaceous beetles and the great majority;\r\n2.2.1. are to be found in _Hoplia_, _Anisonyx_, &c.[2084]; 1.2.2.\r\nin _Belostoma_; three in all the legs in the _Araneidæ_[2085]; in\r\n_Meloe_[2086], _Elater_, &c., each claw is double or consisting of\r\ntwo, which makes _four_ in each leg; and in many _Hippoboscidæ_ there\r\nare _six_[2087]; in _Nepa_ and the Myriapods there is only _one_.\r\nIn most insects, perhaps, the claws are simple or undivided[2088];\r\nbut in _Galeruca_, _Melolontha subspinosa_[2089], &c., they are\r\nbifid at the apex; as is the exterior claw of the four posterior\r\nlegs in _Chasmodia_ and _Macraspis_[2090] M^cL., and of _all_ in\r\n_Melolontha horticola_; in _Serica brunnea_ M^cL. the claws are all\r\ncleft at the extremity, but the internal tooth is broad, flat, and\r\nobtuse[2091]; in _Melolontha vulgaris_ and _Pelidnota punctata_\r\nM^cL.[2092], the claws are armed with an internal tooth near the\r\nbase[2093]. In the _Araneidæ_, which have three claws, the two\r\nexternal ones are furnished with several parallel teeth, which the\r\nanimal uses to keep separate the threads of its web, and probably for\r\nother purposes[2094]; and some Predaceous beetles, as _Lebia_ and\r\n_Cymindis_, have both their claws similarly furnished[2095]. These\r\norgans vary in their relative _proportions_: thus, in _Anoplognathus_\r\nthe inner claw is much smaller than the other[2096]; and in _Elater\r\nsulcatus_, _fuscipes_, &c., it is represented by a mere bristle; in\r\n_Hoplia_, in the anterior _tarsus_ it is not half the length of the\r\nouter one[2097]; in _Areoda_ and _Pelidnota_ M^cL. this last is the\r\nsmallest. They vary also in length--in _Rynchænus_, _Ascalaphus_,\r\n&c., they are very short; in the Lamellicorns, _Galeodes_, &c., very\r\nlong; and in _Myrmeleon_ longer than the claw-joint. With regard to\r\ntheir _curvature_ they generally form the segment of a circle; in\r\nmany _Asilidæ_ they are crooked like the claws of the eagle[2098],\r\nand the posterior one of the _Hopliæ_ is bent like a hook[2099];\r\nthey most commonly diverge from each other; but in the _Rutelidæ_,\r\n_Anoplognathidæ_, &c., they are perfectly parallel, and in the\r\nformer often inflexed[2100]. With regard to _other_ appendages of\r\nthe part we are treating of, if you examine the stag-beetle and many\r\nother Lamellicorns, you will find between the claws a minute but\r\nconspicuous joint terminated by two bristles which seem to mimic\r\nthe _ungula_ and its claws; these parts are what are denominated\r\nin the table the _palmula_, _plantula_, and _pseudonychia_: in the\r\nstag-beetle these are long[2101]; in the _Melolonthidæ_ short[2102];\r\nand in many _Cetoniadæ_ they resemble an intermediate claw.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of the _appendages_ of the _tarsi_ are to be\r\nlooked for on their under side or sole (_solea_), and are the means\r\nby which numbers of insects can overcome atmospheric pressure and\r\nwalk against gravity. Many of these have been fully described in a\r\nformer letter[2103]; but much that relates to them was there omitted,\r\nwhich I shall now detail to you. _Four_ kinds of _pulvilli_, as I\r\nwould call these appendages, are found in the sole of insects, upon\r\neach of which I shall make a few remarks.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ is a _cushion_ or brush composed of very thickly set hairs\r\nor short bristles: examples of this you will find in the majority of\r\n_Tetramerous_ and _Trimerous_ beetles. In _Chrysomela_, _Timarcha_,\r\n&c., there is _one_ of these cushions on each of the _three_ first\r\njoints; in _Prionus_, _Liparus_, &c., there is a pair; and in\r\n_Coccinella_ on the _two_ first; in others (_Balaninus Nucum_, &c.)\r\na pair only on the penultimate joint; in _Calandra Palmarum_, _Rhina\r\nbarbirostris_, &c., that joint has an intire cushion; in _Eurynotus\r\nmuricatus_ K.[2104] the three first joints of the four anterior tarsi\r\nare similarly circumstanced, but the cushions resemble sponge[2105].\r\n\r\nThe _second_ kind of cushion is a vesicular _membrane_ capable of\r\nbeing inflated. This distinguishes the tarsi of _Thrips_[2106], and\r\nmany _Acari_ L.[2107]; likewise those of _Xenos_[2108]; and also of\r\nmany _Orthoptera_ fully described on a former occasion[2109], though\r\nthe fact of their capacity of inflation has not been ascertained,\r\nbelong to this section.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ kind of covering of the sole is when the three or\r\nfour first joints of the _tarsus_ each terminate in _one_ or\r\n_two_ membranous lobes or appendages: of the first description is\r\n_Priocera_ K., in which the lobes are involute[2110]; and of the\r\nsecond _Rhipicera_ Latr.[2111], in which there is a pair on each\r\njoint, in the Brazil species set with very fine hairs.\r\n\r\nThe _fourth_ and last kind are what may with the utmost propriety be\r\ndenominated _suckers_, since their use as such is clearly ascertained.\r\nThese are not only to be found in a large proportion of the _Diptera_,\r\nin some of which there are _two_ of them, as in the _Asilidæ_[2112];\r\nand in others _three_, as the _Tabanidæ_[2113]; but also in many of\r\nthe subsequent Orders: thus, in the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_, in\r\n_Scutellera_ and _Pentatoma_, but not the _Reduviadæ_, and in the\r\nNeuropterous genus _Nymphes_ Leach there is a minute one under each\r\nclaw. It is discoverable between the claws in many _Hymenoptera_, as\r\n_Apis_[2114], _Vespa_, &c. But the genus that exhibits to the curious\r\nEntomologist the most singular and elaborate apparatus of this kind is\r\n_Dytiscus_ Latr.; and the examination of the under side of the _hand_\r\nof any _male_ of this genus will almost compel the most inattentive\r\nobserver to glorify the wisdom and skill of the ALLFATHER so\r\nconspicuously manifested in the structure of these complex organs. For\r\nthis part in these, instead of two or three pedunculate cups as in the\r\ninsects just mentioned, is composed of a vast number, some large and\r\nsome small. If you take a male specimen of the common _D. marginalis_,\r\nyou will find that the three first joints of the hand are very much\r\ndilated, so as to form a plate or shield nearly circular, fringed all\r\nround with stiffish hairs; if you next examine the under side of this\r\nplate with a good magnifier, you will discover at the base, where it\r\nis united to the cubit, two circular cups, the external one more than\r\nthree times the size of the other, with an umbilicated centre[2115];\r\nbesides these two larger cups the rest of the shield is covered by a\r\nvast number of minute ones of a similar construction[2116]: the larger\r\ncups are nearly sessile, but the smaller are elevated upon a tubular\r\nfootstalk[2117]; the three first joints of the intermediate _tarsi_\r\nare also dilated, but not into an orbicular shield, and thickly set\r\nwith minute pedunculated suckers[2118]. The structure varies however\r\nin different species. Thus in _D. limbatus_ the shield is triangular\r\nwith the smaller suckers at the base, and two rows of larger oblong\r\nones, concave but not umbilicated, at the apex; in another Brazilian\r\nundescribed species (_D. obovatus_ K. MS.) the shield is oblong and\r\nquite covered with suckers like those last mentioned; in _D. sulcatus_\r\n(_Acilius_ Leach) almost the whole plate is occupied by a very large\r\nsucker, above which, at some distance in the inner side, are two\r\nsmaller ones, while the extremity of the shield is covered by minute\r\nones elevated on long footstalks: the central umbilicated elevation\r\nof the large one, which nearly fills its cavity, is in this species\r\nbeautifully radiated. The male of _Colymbetes transversalis_ has also\r\nan orbicular shield, but the suckers are much less strongly marked. The\r\nuse of this organ has been before sufficiently explained[2119].\r\n\r\nA few words will be necessary upon the _folding_ of the legs in\r\n_repose_. When insects _walk_, the thigh is usually in an _ascending_\r\nposition, rising _above_ the horizontal line, the _tibia_ forming with\r\nit rather an obtuse angle, and the _tarsus_ nearly a right one with\r\nthe _tibia_; but in the Myriapods, as far as I can unravel their swift\r\nmany-footed motions, these angles in walking do not take place; in\r\nrepose however, in many insects, the _coxa_ forms an angle with the\r\nthigh _below_ the horizontal line and with the _tibia_ above it, and\r\nthe _tibia_ and _tarsus_ continue in the same line, and point downwards\r\nnearly vertically; in others, as in the _Tetramerous_ beetles, the\r\nlast-mentioned joints form an angle with each other and turn upwards,\r\nthe _tibia_ having an external oblique cavity to permit this; but\r\nthe insects most remarkable for packing close their legs are those\r\ncarnivorous genera _Dermestes_, _Anthrenus_, _Byrrhus_, &c. In the\r\nlast-mentioned genus there are cavities in the under side of the trunk,\r\nin each division of the breast, and at the base of the abdomen, to\r\nreceive the legs when folded; the _coxæ_ have also a cavity to receive\r\nthe _base_ of the thigh. In the _anterior_ legs this last part has a\r\nlongitudinal one on its _upper_ side, and in the four _posterior_ on\r\nthe _under_, which receives the _tibiæ_, which at the inner edge are\r\nstraight, and at the outer curvilinear, and the _tarsi_ are turned up\r\nand received by the concave part, on the _anterior_ side of the _first_\r\npair and the _posterior_ side of the two _last_ of the _tibiæ_, so\r\nas to lie between it and the body: when the legs are close packed,\r\nthe animal looks almost as if it had none. I have observed that when\r\n_Dytisci_ repose on the water, the posterior legs are turned up and\r\nlaid over the elytra, and curved towards the head.\r\n\r\n\r\nvi. _Pectines._ I must next say a few words upon a remarkable organ,\r\nwhich seems in some degree supplementary to the _legs_, by which\r\nthe CREATOR has distinguished the genus _Scorpio_, called from\r\nits parallel teeth, set in a back, their _pecten_ or comb[2120].\r\nThis back consists of two or more articulations, is attached by\r\nits anterior extremity to the sides of the posterior piece of the\r\n_mesostethium_, and is marked by a longitudinal furrow or channel.\r\nThe teeth, which vary in number in the different species, and in\r\nthe same species at different periods of its growth, are usually\r\novato-lanceolate, or obtusangular, furnished on their exterior edge\r\nwith what appears to be a longitudinal sucker, and supported between\r\ntheir bases, or at the base, both within and without, by triangular,\r\nconical, or subglobose props. With regard to the _use_ of these\r\norgans, it has not been clearly ascertained. Amouroux states that\r\nhe has seen the animals use them as feet, and he conjectures that\r\nby them they may fix themselves and turn upon them as on a pivot,\r\nwhen they have to make a retrograde movement[2121]. M. Latreille,\r\nfrom their having branchial pouches immediately under them, seems to\r\nthink that they are connected with respiration[2122]. This may be\r\ntrue; but from the suckers just described, I am inclined to think\r\nwith Amouroux, that they are useful to the animal in its _motions_,\r\nand that like the suckers of the Gecko, flies, &c., they enable it to\r\nsupport itself against gravity and to climb perpendicular surfaces.\r\n\r\nWhether the five obtriangular plates, elevated on a pedicle, which are\r\nfound arranged in a series on the under side of each of the jointed\r\n_coxæ_ of the posterior legs in _Galeodes_, are at all analogous to the\r\npectens of scorpions, has not been ascertained[2123]. M. Leon Dufour\r\nwatched them very attentively in one species (G. _intrepidus_), but he\r\ncould observe no motion in them[2124].\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1585] For the reason which induced the authors to use this word\r\ninstead of _Terminology_, before employed, see VOL.

I observed myself lately,\r\nthat _Elophilus tenax_, if held by the anterior part of the body,\r\nwhen it hummed, alternately opened and shut this spiracle. The wings\r\nduring the sound vibrated intensely. The hum ceased and was renewed,\r\nas they were restrained from this motion or released from restraint;\r\nwhen the wing was moved towards the head, a different sound was\r\nemitted from that produced when it merely vibrated.\r\n\r\n[1650] PLATE IX.

Chabrier, who agrees with him, M. Latreille\r\nalso is of opinion, that the _parapleura_ is the analogue of the\r\nposterior _coxæ_. _Ubi supra_, c. ii. 312. Note 2.\r\n\r\n[1775] M. Latreille has changed the denomination of this Order to\r\n_Rhiphiptera_, because at first he thought that these organs were\r\nnot at all analogous to elytra or wings; but since, upon further\r\ninvestigation, he appears to admit that they assist in flight (_Annales\r\nGénér. des Scienc. Phys._ VI. xviii. 8. Compare MacLeay, _Hor. Entom._\r\n423. Note *), in common justice he is bound to restore the name\r\noriginally given to the Order. In the same place of the work here\r\nquoted, M. Latreille also speaks of these _pseudelytra_, as I would\r\ncall them, as appendages of the _mesothorax_: but whoever consults\r\nMr. Bauer's admirable figures of _Xenos Peckii_ (_Linn. Trans._ xi.\r\n_t._ ix.), and is aware of the unimpeached and minute accuracy of that\r\nadmirable microscopic artist, will be convinced that they belong to the\r\n_anterior_ legs, and consequently to the _prothorax_.\r\n\r\n[1776] PLATE X. and PLATE XXVIII.

Mr. MacLeay's opinion seems\r\nto receive some confirmation from a circumstance overlooked when the\r\n_larvæ_ of insects were treated of above (p. 130--), and to which\r\nhe alludes (411); namely, that in _that_ state they consist of two\r\nsegments more than in the _imago_; these follow the three pedigerous\r\nsegments, have no pro-legs, and are supposed to belong to the trunk\r\nrather than to the abdomen. To make this circumstance bear upon the\r\nquestion, it must be proved that in the perfect insect these segments\r\nin some manner become the back of the trunk and bear the wings. This\r\nwould not be more wonderful than many changes that are known to occur\r\nin insects.\r\n\r\n[1780] Latreille, _Organization extérieure des Ins._ 173--.\r\n\r\n[1781] For instance _Meloe_, the female glow-worm, _Lygæus\r\nbrevipennis_, _Ephemera diptera_, _Cynips aptera_, neuter ants, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n[1782] See above, p. 559.\r\n\r\n[1783] _Chionea araneoïdes_ Dolm.\r\n\r\n[1784] See above, p. 560, and VOL.

Apum Angl._ (1801), in\r\nwhich those of _Hymenoptera_ were stated to consist of three portions,\r\nviz. _Basis_, _Medium_, _Apex_ (i. 211.); which mode of dividing them\r\nwas at first adopted by M. Latreille (_Gen. Crust. et Ins_. iii.\r\n226. Note 1.) The same learned author (Ibid. iv. 239.), with regard\r\nto the _Diptera_, made a near approximation to the plan of dividing\r\nwings into longitudinal areas, but by the addition of a _basal_ area,\r\nwhich interrupts the attention to the communication of the areas with\r\ntheir _axes_, he has rendered his system less perfect. Two of his\r\nterms--_Costal Area_ and _Intermediate Area_, are here adopted; but\r\nhis _Internal_ is changed to the _Anal_ Area, for the term _internal_\r\nbelongs rather to the base of the wing. M. Latreille afterwards\r\nrelinquished both these plans, _N. Dict. d'Hist.

Latreille has placed in the\r\n_pentamerous_ section, vary considerably in the number of their tarsal\r\njoints. Thus in general in _Thanasimus_ the _tarsi_ are _pentamerous_;\r\nbut in _T. formicarius_ they appear to be _heteromerous_; and in\r\n_Enoplium_, _Opilo_, _Clerus_ and _Necrobia_ they are _tetramerous_. M.\r\nLatreille's expression, (_N. Dict. d'Hist. Nat._ vii. 172.) \"le premier\r\narticle etant fort court et caché sous le second,\" seems to indicate\r\nthat there is a _fifth_ joint in some of these, the first being\r\nconcealed under the second; but I have never been able to discover it.\r\nPerhaps he reckoned the _pulvillus_ as a joint?\r\n\r\n[2062] The term _heteromerous_ properly belongs to _all_ insects in\r\nwhich the different pairs of tarsi vary _inter se_ in the number of\r\ntheir joints, and it is here used in that large sense.\r\n\r\n[2063] These three genera appear _really_ to have only _six_ legs,\r\nsince the pedipalps or maxillary legs are not armed with claws, while\r\nthe real representatives of the legs, or three last pair, are so\r\ndistinguished. In _Phrynus_ and _Thelyphona_ the anterior pair are\r\nchelate; but in _Galeodes_ they are pediform, as in the _Araneidæ_,\r\nand the great chelæ are the mandibles.\r\n\r\n[2064] PLATE XXVI.

My remarks upon it will be under the following heads:\r\nIts _substance_; _articulation with the trunk_; _composition_; _shape\r\nand proportions_; its _appendages_; and its _clothing_.\r\n\r\ni. _Substance._ Under this head I may observe in general, that where\r\nthe abdomen is protected by _hard_ elytra or tegmina, as in most\r\n_Coleoptera_, and many Heteropterous _Hemiptera_, the _upper_ side is\r\ngenerally of a softer and more flexible substance than the _under_,\r\nwhich from its exposure requires a greater degree of hardness and\r\nfirmness to prevent its being injured. In some,--as the _Dynastidæ_\r\nand those beetles whose elytra are connate, or as it were soldered\r\ntogether, the former is scarcely more than _membrane_. In others of\r\nthe above tribes, nearly the _whole_ of the back of whose abdomen, as\r\nin _Staphylinus_; or only its anal _extremity_, as in _Melolontha_;\r\nor its _sides_, as in _Lygæus_, &c., is not covered by the elytra or\r\ntegmina, that part, as was requisite for its protection, is harder\r\nthan the covered portion.\r\n\r\nii. _Articulation with the trunk._ Two distinct modes of this\r\narticulation take place:--in the first the abdomen is united to the\r\ntrunk by the _whole_ diameter of its base, without any appearance of\r\nincision; in the other only a _small part_ of that diameter, with\r\na very visible incision. All the Orders, except the majority of\r\nthe _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_, and the _Araneidæ_, belong to the\r\n_first_ of these sections; for in all these the aperture by which the\r\nabdomen is suspended to the trunk, occupies the whole of the base;\r\nI say _suspended_, because, though in many cases it inosculates in\r\nthe posterior cavity of the latter part, it does not in all, and the\r\nmargins of the orifice are united by ligament to those of that cavity.\r\nIndeed, in the _Coleoptera_ and others that have a somewhat prominent\r\nmetaphragm[2125], the trunk may with more propriety be said to\r\ninosculate in the abdomen. With regard to the _second_ section,--those\r\nin which the orifice is of less diameter than the base, occupying\r\nonly a portion of it,--it may be further subdivided into those whose\r\nabdomen is _sessile_, and those in which it is united to the trunk\r\nby the intervention of a long or short _pedicle_ or footstalk: to\r\nthe first of these subdivisions belong all those _Diptera_ that have\r\nan incision between the trunk and abdomen--for many tribes of this\r\nOrder, as the _Tipulidæ_, _Asilidæ_, &c., belong rather to the _first_\r\nsection--and the _Araneidæ_; the abdomen, however, in _all_ is merely\r\nsuspended, without any inosculation. To the _second_ subdivision belong\r\nall the _Hymenoptera_, except the _Tenthredinidæ_ and _Siricidæ_,\r\nthe abdomen of which is united to the trunk by the whole diameter\r\nof its base; these may be further subdivided into those that have a\r\nvery _short_ pedicle and those that have a _long_ one; but as the\r\nmode of articulation in both these is the same, there will be no\r\nnecessity to consider them separately. M. Cuvier has included the\r\n_Diptera_ and _Araneidæ_ in the same tribe with such _Hymenoptera_\r\nas have a petiolate abdomen[2126]; but as the manner in which the\r\nlatter articulates with the trunk is widely different from that of\r\nthe _Diptera_ &c., I thought it best to consider them as distinct;\r\nespecially as in the _Diptera_ there is no tendency to a pedicle,\r\nwhile only the above two tribes of _Hymenoptera_ are wholly without\r\nit. This learned author thus describes the articulation where the\r\nabdomen is connected by a pedicle. \"They have,\" says he, \"a real solid\r\narticulation, a kind of hinge in which the first segment is emarginate\r\nabove, and receives a saliant portion of the trunk upon which it moves;\r\nthis articulation is rendered solid by elastic and powerful ligaments;\r\nmuscles which have their attachment in the interior of the trunk\r\nare inserted in this first segment, and determine the extent of its\r\nmovement[2126].\" But this passage by no means conveys an adequate idea\r\nof the singular mechanism by which the _Divine Artificer_ has enabled\r\nthese little creatures to impart the necessary movements to an organ\r\nso bulky compared with its very diminutive point of attachment. As\r\nno author that has fallen in my way has examined the articulation of\r\nthe abdomen with the trunk in these _Hymenoptera_ with the attention\r\nwhich it merits[2127], I shall enlarge a little upon it. You would\r\nbe surprised, and not without reason incredulous, were I seriously\r\nto assert that these insects lift their weighty posteriors by means\r\nof a _rope_ and _pulley_; yet something like this really does take\r\nplace, though not with all in a manner equally striking. The point of\r\narticulation in the insects in question, except in _Evania_, is at the\r\nbase of the metathorax just above the posterior pair of legs: here\r\nyou see a small orifice, either insulated or connected by a narrow\r\nopening with the larger one, when the abdomen is removed, which in\r\nmany instances, as in the common wasp, is surmounted by another still\r\nsmaller, through which, if you examine it attentively, you will find\r\nthere is transmitted a flat and sometimes broadish ligament or rather\r\n_tendon_, in which the levator muscles of the abdomen, attached by\r\ntheir other end to the metaphragm[2128], terminate: another minute\r\norifice above the base of the pedicle affords a point of attachment to\r\nthe tendon, so as to give it prize upon the abdomen. Here the upper\r\norifice in the trunk is the _pulley_ (_trochlea_)[2129], the tendon is\r\nthe _rope_ (_funiculus_)[2129], and the abdomen is the weight to be\r\nlifted. When the muscles contract, the tendon, running over the edge of\r\nthe aperture, is pulled in, and the part just named is elevated; and\r\nwhen they are relaxed the tendon is let out, and it falls. Some little\r\nvariation in the structure takes place in different tribes: thus, in\r\nthe _Formicidæ_, _Scoliadæ_, &c., instead of a separate orifice, the\r\npart I call the pulley is merely an upper sinus of the large orifice\r\nthat receives the pedicle of the abdomen. The shape of these orifices,\r\nboth of the trunk and abdomen, varies in different genera: thus, in the\r\nbee it is triangular, with the vertex reversed; and in the wasp the\r\nupper one is circular, and the lower one transversely oblong; but in\r\nall, the apertures of the trunk correspond with those of the abdomen.\r\nIn _Evania_, in which the minute abdomen is inserted in the upper side\r\nof the metathorax, there is scarcely any trace of this structure.\r\nWith regard to the articulation of the pedicle itself with the lower\r\norifice of the trunk, it appears simply suspended, with little or no\r\ninosculation. I may observe under this head, that though the abdomen in\r\nalmost all insects is wholly clear of the cavity of the trunk, yet in\r\nsome _Phalangidæ_ (_Gonyleptes_ K.) it appears almost retracted within\r\nit[2130].\r\n\r\niii. _Composition._ I shall next consider the _segments_ into which\r\nthe abdomen is usually divided, their number, and other circumstances\r\nconnected with them. In the _Hippoboscidæ_, _Acaridæ_, _Phalangidæ_,\r\nand _Araneidæ_, the part we are considering is not divided into\r\nsegments, though in some instances, as in _Gonyleptes_ and the\r\ncancriform _Epeiræ_[2131], they are represented by _folds_; but in the\r\ngreat majority of insects it consists of several dorsal and ventral\r\npieces or segments, forming by their union the _annuli_ or rings into\r\nwhich it appears divided. The _number_ of these abdominal segments\r\nvaries in different insects; I have noticed more than _twenty_ such\r\nvariations, and probably there are many more. Before I give you them\r\nin detail, I must first observe that the dorsal and ventral segments,\r\nthough sometimes they correspond in number, yet very often do not,\r\nthe dorsal most commonly exceeding the ventral by a segment; in a few\r\ncases however the reverse takes place. In the sexes also there is\r\nfrequently a difference in the number of segments, as has been before\r\nobserved[2132]. I shall express the variations in question by two\r\nfigures, the _first_ representing the number of _dorsal_ segments, and\r\nthe _second_ the _ventral_--they usually only express the _apparent_\r\nsegments: perhaps a very general examination and dissection might bring\r\nmany of them nearer to a common type.\r\n\r\n  1:1. _Chelonus._\r\n\r\n  3:3. _Chrysidæ_[2133].\r\n\r\n  4:2. _Leucospis_[2134].\r\n\r\n  5:5. _Syrphus_.\r\n\r\n  5:6. _Halictus_ ♀.\r\n\r\n  6:5. _Nepa._\r\n\r\n  6:6. { _Halictus_ ♂.\r\n       { _Belostoma._\r\n\r\n  7:5. { _Curculio_ L.\r\n       { _Cerambyx_ L.\r\n\r\n  7:6. _Dytiscus_ ♀.\r\n\r\n  7:7. _Ammophila_, &c.\r\n\r\n  8:6. { _Dytiscus_ ♂.\r\n       { _Lucanus_, &c.\r\n\r\n  8:7. _Geotrupes_ Latr.\r\n\r\n  8:8. _Pimpla._\r\n\r\n  8:10. _Euchlora_ M^cL.[2135]?\r\n\r\n  8:13. _Scutigera._\r\n\r\n  9:5. _Carabus_ Latr.\r\n\r\n  9:6. _Gymnopleurus_ Ill.\r\n\r\n  9:7. _Perga_ Leach ♀.\r\n\r\n  9:8. _Perga_ ♂.\r\n\r\n  10:7. _Locusta_ Leach ♀.\r\n\r\n  10:8. --------------- ♂.\r\n\r\n  10:10. _Æshna._\r\n\r\n  11:7. _Phasma._\r\n\r\n  11:9. _Chelifer._\r\n\r\n  12:11. _Thelyphonus._\r\n\r\n  Many: _Myriapoda._\r\n\r\nI shall next explain the articulation of the segments with each other,\r\nboth that of the rings formed by the union of the dorsal and ventral\r\npieces, and that of those pieces themselves. In general it may be\r\nstated with respect to the former, that each ring is suspended by\r\nligament to that which precedes it; but this takes place in _three_\r\nways--in some the margins of the suspended rings _touch_ each other\r\nonly, with little or no _inosculation_; in others the _dorsal_ segments\r\nonly touch, and the base of each _ventral_ is covered more or less by\r\nthe apex of the preceding one; and in others again the base of the\r\nwhole ring, both above and below, is so covered, or inosculates. The\r\nfirst kind here mentioned you will find exemplified in _Melolontha_,\r\n_Geotrupes_, _Musca_, &c.; the second in _Scorpio_; and the third in\r\n_Staphylinus_, the _Hymenoptera_, and many others. In the _Coleoptera_,\r\nsays M. Cuvier, speaking of the movements of the abdomen, the rings\r\nonly touch each other at the margin, and the movement is very limited;\r\nwhilst in the _Hymenoptera_ they are so many little hoops, which\r\ninosculate in each other as the tubes of a telescope, one third only of\r\ntheir extent often appearing uncovered[2136]. We see the reason of this\r\nstructure when we consider the calls they have for greater powers of\r\nmovement in this part in laying their eggs, and annoying their enemies\r\nand assailants; and also in the _Staphylinidæ_ to enable them to turn\r\nup their abdomen like a scorpion, both as a posture of attack, and to\r\nfold their wings: in all cases, however, as far as my observation goes,\r\nthese animals, when they want to lengthen this part, can disengage the\r\nrings from almost all inosculation, so that no impediment remains to\r\nany movement.\r\n\r\nThe articulation of the dorsal and ventral segments with each\r\nother is next to be considered. In _Iulus_ and some _Centroti_ the\r\nring appears to be formed of a single piece, with scarcely any\r\ntrace of the existence of any such division; it is however almost\r\nuniversal, and is of _three_ descriptions; in the first the dorsal\r\nsegments are united to the ventral _at_ the lateral margin or edge\r\nof the abdomen; in the second it is _above_ this margin, and in\r\nthe third _below_ it. You will find that in _Fulgora_ and many\r\nother Homopterous _Hemiptera_ these segments unite at the margin,\r\nas they do likewise in _Cimex lectularius_ belonging to the other\r\nHemipterous section; but in the rest of the Heteropterous tribes,\r\nthe ventral segments turn upwards, and their union with the dorsal\r\nis in the back of the abdomen; in these the _Hemelytra_ and wings\r\nonly cover the dorsal segments, leaving the edge, formed of the\r\nends of the ventral, uncovered. The Lamellicorn beetles also, and\r\nmany other _Coleoptera_, exhibit the same structure. To the last\r\ndescription, in which the dorsal segments turn down to meet the\r\nventral, belong the _Lepidoptera_, _Locusta_ Leach; likewise _Sirex_,\r\n_Chrysis_, and many other _Hymenoptera_. The articulation between\r\nthese segments is by means of an elastic membranous ligament, which\r\nusually is not externally visible; but in many instances, in which\r\nthe connecting ligament is of a firmer substance, as in _Scorpio_,\r\n_Thelyphonus_, and _Phrynus_, it is very conspicuous, and in the\r\nlatter genus exhibits many longitudinal folds, as it does likewise in\r\n_Gryllotalpa_, which must permit a vast extension of the abdomen. In\r\nthis membrane, in some cases, as in _Dynastes_ M^cL., _Melolontha_,\r\n&c., the two or three first spiracles are fixed[2137]. In the\r\n_Hymenoptera_ and many other insects the dorsal segments do not unite\r\nby their _margin_ with the ventral, but the _end_ of each dorsal laps\r\nover that of the corresponding ventral.\r\n\r\n_Dorsal segments_[2138]. I shall next notice the segments _seriatim_,\r\nin the order of their occurrence, beginning with the _dorsal_ ones.\r\nThe most remarkable circumstance with respect to these that occurs\r\nto my recollection takes place in the Cancroid spiders (_Epeira\r\ncancriformis_, _aculeata_, &c.), in which the back of the abdomen is\r\nformed by a plate, in some extended in a transverse direction (_E.\r\ncancriformis_), in others in a longitudinal one (_E. aculeata_),\r\nof a much harder substance than the under side and quite flat, set\r\nwith strong sharp spines, in the former species apparently moveable,\r\nand terminating behind in a piece resembling in some measure the\r\nscutellum of the _Stratyomidæ_ and similarly armed with a pair of\r\nspines[2139]: in _E. aculeata_ the sides of the abdomen, under the\r\nplate, have a number of longitudinal folds like those of _Phrynus_.\r\nIn _Cryptocerus_, a genus of ants peculiar to South America, the\r\n_first_ segment, not reckoning the pedicle, forms almost the whole\r\nback of the abdomen, and the three last are so minute as scarcely\r\nto be distinguishable. Nothing very remarkable is exhibited by the\r\nother segments, except that in _Trichius_ the _penultimate_ is the\r\nlargest; in some _Staphylinidæ_ (_S. splendens_) and _Brachini_ (_B.\r\nmelanocephalus_) it is emarginate, and in the former tribe also often\r\nterminating in a white membrane. The _dorsal_ segment most worthy\r\nof notice is the last, which is called the _podex_; for though in\r\ngeneral it is a minute piece, often retracted within the abdomen\r\nand invisible, as in many _Diptera_, yet sometimes it is the most\r\nconspicuous of the dorsal segments. It is most commonly triangular,\r\nand usually deflexed and forming an angle with a horizontal line;\r\nbut in _Clytra_, _Chlamys_, and _Oryctes_, it is inflexed; in many\r\nLamellicorns it is nearly vertical. In _Tettigonia_ F., many other\r\nHomopterous _Hemiptera_, and some _Hymenoptera_ (_Cimbex_), its sides\r\nturn down and become ventral; on its lower side it has in these a\r\nlongitudinal cavity which receives the ovipositor in repose[2140].\r\nIn many other insects it unites with the last ventral segment, the\r\n_hypopygium_, to form a tube for that organ, as you will find in\r\n_Callidium violaceum_[2141], many _Muscidæ_, and _Thelyphonus_. As to\r\nits _termination_ the podex is sometimes bifid, _Blatta_; bipartite,\r\n_Ranatra_; mucronate, _Sirex_; acuminate, _Melolontha vulgaris_,\r\n_Trichius hemipterus_. Generally this part is flat; but the disk is\r\nelevated or gibbous in _Oryctes_ and some other Lamellicorns. In the\r\nmajority of the _Coleoptera_ Order it is quite covered by the wings\r\nand elytra; but in many of the last-mentioned tribe, and sometimes\r\nthe penultimate segment also, it is not covered by them[2142]. In\r\nsome insects the piece we are considering appears to consist of\r\n_two_ segments; in the male of _Locusta morbillosa_ the whole podex\r\nis rhomboidal, but it is formed by two triangular pieces which\r\narticulate with each other; this structure permits the more easy\r\nelevation of the terminal one for the extrusion of the feces.\r\n\r\n_Ventral Segments_[2143]. We are now to turn our attention to the\r\n_ventral_ segments of the abdomen. The first of them is what is\r\ncalled the _epigastrium_[2144] in the table. This part, according\r\nto M. Chabrier, is of considerable importance to the animal in\r\nflight, as, by its pressure against the trunk, not only regulating\r\nthe movements of the abdomen, but as, in his opinion, contributing\r\nto push forward the trunk[2145] in the descent of the animal. It is\r\nremarkable only in the _Coleoptera_ and Heteropterous _Hemiptera_,\r\nto which my observations upon it will be confined. It may be stated\r\nas usually consisting of two articulations, that nearest the trunk\r\nbeing narrow, and in the Predaceous beetles[2146], as also in\r\n_Scutellera_, _Pentatoma_, &c., interrupted in the middle[2147].\r\nIn many _Lamellicorns_ this joint is concealed under the posterior\r\n_coxæ_, and with the anterior part of the second forms a hollow\r\ncavity for their reception; this last joint is what is properly\r\nthe _Epigastrium_, the former, especially when distinct, being\r\ncalled in the table the _Hypochondria_. In _Sagra_ and _Brentus_\r\nthe _epigastrium_ is particularly conspicuous for its size, in the\r\nformer occupying half, and in the latter nearly two-thirds of the\r\nunder side of the abdomen; but in general it is distinguished from\r\nthe remaining segments only by the central mucro or point that\r\nterminates it towards the trunk[2148], and which is received by\r\na sinus of the _metasternum_; this point is generally minute and\r\ntriangular, but in _Sagra_ it is large and rounded at the extremity,\r\nand in _Calandra_ it terminates nearly in a transverse line somewhat\r\nwaving. It is most remarkable, however, in some species of the\r\nHeteropterous genus _Edessa_ F.; for in _E. nigripes_ and affinities\r\nit is a sharp _sterniform_ conical horn, which passing between the\r\nfour posterior legs covers the end of the _promuscis_. In fact, this\r\npart appears a kind of abdominal _sternum_. In the _Cetoniadæ_,\r\n&c., the _Hypochondria_ unite before this mucro, and form a ridge\r\nwhich articulates with it, and dips towards the abdominal cavity;\r\nin _Scolytus_ the _epigastrium_ is much elevated from the rest of\r\nthe ventral segments, so that the under side of the abdomen appears\r\nas if it were suddenly cut off, whence Herbst's awkward though not\r\ninexpressive name, _Ekkoptogaster_; this part in this genus has\r\nsomething of a posterior mucro.\r\n\r\nThe intermediate ventral segments exhibiting no very remarkable\r\npeculiarities, I shall pass them without further notice, and call\r\nyour attention to the last, which is opposed to the _podex_,\r\nand which I have named the _hypopygium_[2149]. Though usually a\r\n_single_ small piece, in _Edessa_ and many _Pentatomæ_ it consists\r\nof _several_ plates; and in _Trichius_ it is very large: it is\r\nmostly _intire_, but in the male _Dytisci_ it is _cleft_; in _Lamia\r\nocellata_ trilobed; in _Edessa_ tripartite; in _Centrotus Taurus_\r\nit is boat-shaped and hollowed out to receive the stalk of the\r\novipositor. It is also generally in the same line with the body, but\r\nin _Xenos_ it is turned up and bent inwards[2150].\r\n\r\niv. _Shape._ With regard to _shape_, in some Orders the abdomen\r\nvaries considerably; but the most general form is one that approaches\r\nto trigonal, so that a transverse section will be a triangle, with\r\nthe vertex more or less obtuse, and the base more or less convex;\r\nsome tendency to this form will often be found even in those insects\r\nwhose abdomen appears almost as flat as a leaf, as in many _Aradi_.\r\nIn the hive-bee the transverse section is almost an equilateral\r\ntriangle; in _Belostoma grandis_ the disk of the under side of the\r\npart in question is longitudinally elevated into a trigonal ridge,\r\nthe section of which is an equilateral triangle, the sides being\r\nquite flat. In general, in the vertical section of an abdomen, the\r\nvertex of the triangle points _downwards_, but in _Libellula_ F. it\r\npoints _upwards_. In _Blatta_ this section is nearly lanceolate; in\r\n_Staphylinus olens_ it is a segment of a circle with the convex side\r\ndownwards; in _Æshna_ F. with that side upwards; and in _Agrion_\r\nthe section is circular. In _Copris_, _Ateuchus_, &c., the abdomen\r\nis very short and thick; in _Staphylinus_ slender and long; in\r\n_Aradus_, _Nepa_, &c., depressed and flat; compressed in _Ophion_\r\nand _Evania_; conical in _Cœlyoxis_; rhomboidal in many _Mantes_;\r\nboat-shaped in many _Lygæi_; fusiform in various _Papilionidæ_;\r\nlanceolate in some _Ichneumonidæ_, falcate in others; nearly\r\nround in _Diapria pupurascens_; ovate in _Lyrops_; elliptical in\r\n_Andrena_; oblong in many _Xylocopæ_; heart-shaped in the naked\r\n_Euglossæ_; triangular in _Dytiscus_; gibbous in _Flata_; and\r\nvaulted in _Chrysis_. At its base it is truncated in _Sirex_; retuse\r\nin most _bees_; forming the segment of a circle in _Andrena_; in\r\ngeneral sessile, but in the majority of _Hymenoptera_, as has been\r\nalready observed, terminating in a pedicle. The pedicle is very\r\nshort in the _Andrenidæ_ and _Apidæ_; long in the _Sphecidæ_; thick\r\nin the _Formicidæ_; slender in _Evania_; fusiform in _Pelecinus_;\r\nclavate in _Ammophila_; campanulate in many _Vespidæ_; nodose in\r\n_Myrmica_[2151]; squamigerous in _Formica_[2152]: it sometimes also\r\nconsists of _two_ joints, as in _Ammophila_ and many _Vespidæ_.\r\nAs to _margin_, some have none, as _Centrotus_; in others, as\r\n_Dytiscus_, it is very narrow; in others again, wide and flat, as in\r\nthe _Nepidæ_; in _Staphylinus_, &c., it is distinguishable only on\r\nthe upper side of the abdomen; in _Locusta_ Leach only on the under\r\nside, though mostly intire; it is serrated in _Blatta_, sinuated in\r\n_Acanthia paradoxa_, and crenated in _Cerceris_.\r\n\r\nv. _Proportions._ These vary greatly in the different tribes; in some\r\nthe abdomen is long and slender, as in _Locusta_, and _Staphylinus_;\r\ndisproportionably so in a remarkable degree in some _Agrionidæ_ from\r\nSouth America, as _A. lineare_, &c.[2153]; in others it is extremely\r\nshort and thick, as in _Copris_, &c.; a mere appendage in _Evania_;\r\nit is shorter than the elytra in _Trox_; of the same length in most\r\nbeetles; longer in _Melolontha_, _Hister_, &c.; disproportionably so\r\nin _Staphylinus_: though usually of the same width with the trunk,\r\nin many _Mantidæ_ it is much wider[2154]; and more slender in the\r\n_Libellulina_, _Myrmeleon_, &c.\r\n\r\nvi. _Arms and Appendages_[2155]. These are various; and may be\r\nconsidered under the following heads: _processes_; _organs_ of\r\n_respiration_, _motion_ and _prehension_; _weapons_; and other _anal\r\nappendages_ the use of which is unknown.\r\n\r\n1. _Processes._ Under this term I include all prominences of whatever\r\nkind, whether _tubercles_, _teeth_, _spines_, or _horns_, that arm\r\nany part of the abdomen. Many of these are _sexual_ characters, and\r\nhave been sufficiently described in a former letter[2156]; I need\r\nnot therefore detain you long on this head. Of the first kind is a\r\nremarkable elevation that distinguishes the second ventral segment of\r\n_Scolytus Destructor_ (_Ips Scolytus_ Marsh.) or of a species allied\r\nto it[2157]; in _S. pygmæus_ (_I. multistriatus_ Marsh.) the same\r\nsegment is armed by a flat horizontal _tooth_ or horn; in an _Aradus_\r\nfrom Brazil, before alluded to[2158] (_A. laminatus_ K. MS.), the\r\nmargin of the abdomen is surrounded by eight flat subquadrangular\r\nlaminæ; in another species figured by Stoll[2159], it is cut out into\r\nbays by a number of denticulated teeth; and in _Acanthia paradoxa_\r\nby long spinose lobes[2160]. In _Edessa_ F., another genus of bugs,\r\nthe abdomen usually terminates in four strong sharp dentiform spines,\r\nthe intermediate ones being the shortest, and in some the _margin_ is\r\nalso armed with spines[2161]; occasionally the anal spines are very\r\nlong[2162]. In addition to the ventral horns before mentioned that\r\ndistinguish the sexes of some insects[2163]; the males of the genus\r\n_Conops_, a two-winged fly, have, on the antepenultimate ventral\r\nsegment, a singular process, varying in length and shape in the\r\ndifferent species, standing nearly at right angles with the belly,\r\nconvex towards the trunk, and concave towards the anus. De Geer\r\nsupposes that with the anal extremity this forms a forceps with which\r\nthis fly seizes the other sex[2164].\r\n\r\n2. _Organs of respiration_[2165]. I shall defer my account of the\r\n_spiracles_, and other external respiratory organs, till I come\r\nto treat of the system of _respiration_ in insects, when every\r\nthing connected with that subject will be most properly discussed;\r\nbut there are certain appearances in some insects, which at first\r\nsight seem to partake of the same character, but which being really\r\nindependent of that vital function, may here have their place. If you\r\nexamine the abdomen of the mole-cricket (_Gryllotalpa vulgaris_),\r\nyou will easily discover the true spiracles in the folds of the\r\n_pulmonarium_, which separates the back of that part from the belly;\r\nif you next inspect the five intermediate segments of the latter,\r\nyou will discover on each nearer the base a pair of oblique little\r\nchannels, which precisely resemble closed spiracles. These may be\r\ndenominated false or blind spiracles. Again, if you examine the\r\npupa of any _Scutellera_ or _Pentatoma_, in which tribe the true\r\nspiracles are _ventral_, you will discover, placed in a square on the\r\ntwo or three intermediate _dorsal_ segments, four or six elevated\r\npoints resembling spiracles, but not perforated, connected often\r\nby corrugations in the skin or crust[2166]; in the larvæ also of\r\nsome _Reduvii_ the first minute dorsal segment, at each lateral\r\nextremity, has a similar elevation with a central umbilicus precisely\r\nresembling a spiracle, but still not perforated: another instance of\r\nfalse spiracles in this section of the _Hemiptera_, is furnished by\r\n_Aradus laminatus_ before mentioned, in the perfect insect; between\r\nthe spiracle and the margin of each ventral segment is a white round\r\ncallus, with a dark point resembling a perforation on its exterior\r\nside, and terminating internally in a channel covered by membrane\r\nleading to the disk of the segment, so that the whole in shape\r\nresembles a tobacco-pipe[2167]. A number of similar callosities with\r\na central impression, but without any channel, variously disposed,\r\nare also to be found in another bug, _Rhinuchus compressipes_\r\nK.[2168] In the Homopterous section of this Order, a series of\r\nimpressed points, which may be easily mistaken for spiracles, are\r\nto be discovered on both sides of the abdomen, at the margin in\r\n_Centrotus_, in which the real spiracles are quite concealed.\r\n\r\nIn spiders, as we learn from Treviranus, the open _ventral_ spiracles\r\nof the scorpion are replaced by pseudo-spiracles; these in _Epeira\r\nDiadema_ are three pair of small black points: on the back of the\r\nabdomen also are _four_ pair, but in some species there are only\r\n_two_[2169]: the most remarkable, however, are exhibited by the\r\ncancriform spiders before noticed[2170]: in _Epeira cancriformis_, in\r\nthe plate which covers the abdomen, they are dark red spots with an\r\nelevated rim and centre[2171] exactly resembling spiracles, except\r\nthat they are not perforated; there are twenty-four of them, twenty\r\narranged round the margin, and four in a square in the disk.\r\n\r\n3. _Organs of motion._ In a former letter you were told that several\r\ninsects are enabled to leap by means of _organs_ in their abdomen;\r\nI shall now describe such of them as require further elucidation. I\r\nthen said that _Podura_ and _Sminthurus_, two apterous genera, take\r\ntheir leaps by means of an anal _fork_[2172]. In the former genus the\r\nfork consists of a single piece attached to the under side of the\r\nanus, and terminating in a pair of long slender sharp processes which\r\narticulate with it and form the fork or saltatorious instrument[2173].\r\nIn _Sminthurus_ the _tines_, as they may be called, of the fork do not\r\narticulate with the base, but are of the same piece and consist of two\r\njoints, the terminal one being flat and obtuse[2174]. _Machilis_ to\r\nthe anal fork adds eight pair of ventral linear springs (_Elastes_),\r\nwhich are covered with hair or scales, and terminate in a bristle or\r\ntwo. I have on a former occasion mentioned the natatorious laminæ with\r\nwhich the anus of the larva of _Agrion_ and of some _Diptera_ is\r\nfurnished[2175]; the same part in that of _Dytiscus_ ends in a pair\r\nof tapering organs, fringed on each side like the hind-legs of the\r\nimago[2176], which doubtless assist it in swimming; those respiratory\r\nfoliaceous laminæ which so singularly distinguish the abdomen of the\r\nlarvæ of _Ephemera_, like the legs of the Branchiopod _Crustacea_, are\r\nprobably used in some degree as fins, and aid their motions in the\r\nwater[2177]. Under this head may also be mentioned the many-jointed\r\nbristles that form the long tails[2178] of the fly that proceeds from\r\nthese larvæ, whose interesting history I long since enlarged upon; for\r\nwhen they fly the two lateral ones diverge from the central one, and\r\nperhaps perform the same office as the tail feathers (_rectrices_) of\r\nbirds. These bristles are also to be found in _Machilis_[2179], and\r\nprobably, as its _leaps_ are almost as long as _flights_, for a similar\r\npurpose, to steady their motion. I may here lastly state that I once\r\nsaw a _Cryptophagus_ (_Corticaria_ Marsh.), but I forgot to note the\r\nspecies, walking upon my window, which when it wanted to turn fixed\r\nitself to the glass by an inflated anal vesicle, and so accomplished\r\nits purpose.\r\n\r\n4. _Organs of Prehension_[2180]. The abdominal organs of _prehension_\r\nare various; but as the great body of them are connected with the\r\nsexual intercourse of insects, I shall not consider them till I come\r\nto treat on that subject. The only remarkable one that is common to\r\nboth sexes is that of the earwig, which is too well known to every\r\nchild to call for any long description. The external organs of\r\n_oviposition_ I shall also describe hereafter, and likewise those of\r\n_secretion_ that have not already been noticed.\r\n\r\n5. _Weapons._ As the _stings_ of some _Hymenoptera_ are analogous to\r\nthe _ovipositors_ of the majority of that Order, I shall consider\r\nthem both together when I treat of the sexual organs of insects;\r\nbut there is one, and that a tremendous one, not connected with\r\nthose organs, which may be noticed here. I mean the sting of the\r\n_scorpion_. There appears to be some analogy between the poisonous\r\nfangs of one tribe of the Ophidian reptiles[2181], the mandibulæ\r\nof spiders[2182], the second pair of pedipalps, or the fangs of\r\nthe _Scolopendridæ_[2183], and the organ in question[2184]; but\r\nthe last possesses this peculiarity, that it is placed at the\r\nopposite extremity of the body, where it is preceded by a long\r\njointed tail, which properly speaking is merely a continuation of\r\nthe abdomen, since the spinal marrow, the intestinal canal, and the\r\n_pseudocardia_, are extended into it[2185]. Providence might have a\r\ndouble view in thus contracting the dimensions of this part of the\r\nabdomen; in the first place, the animal is by this enabled to turn\r\nits tail over its back preparatory to its inflicting a wound, and\r\nin the second, perhaps, this formation favours the sublimation of\r\nthe venom, the long tail acting as an alembic for that purpose. This\r\nmachine consists of six angular joints including the sting, the last\r\nbut one being the longest, and the last inflated, as it were, at the\r\nbase, and terminating in a sharp subulato-conical point which curves\r\ndownwards, and has an orifice in a channel at the end on each side.\r\nTreviranus could not discover these orifices in the sting of _Scorpio\r\neuropæus_[2186]; they may however be readily seen if viewed with a\r\nsufficiently high power, though not under a common pocket microscope.\r\nWhether the very slender, many-jointed, _real_ tail of the remarkable\r\ngenus _Thelyphonus_ is used in any respect as a _weapon_, has not\r\nbeen ascertained: it is a filiform hairy organ consisting in some\r\nspecimens of more than _twenty_ joints, the first being very much\r\nlarger than the rest[2187].\r\n\r\n6. _Appendages_[2188]. We are lastly to advert to those _appendages_\r\nof the abdomen of which the use is not at present discovered.\r\nThese are the styles (_styli_) of the _Staphylinidæ_; the leaflets\r\n(_foliola_) of the _Libellulina_; the floret (_flosculus_) of the\r\n_Fulgoræ_; the _cerci_ of the _Blattidæ_ and _Gryllina_; and the\r\nthreads (_fila_) of _Machilis_: but having nothing important to add\r\nconcerning them, the definitions of those terms will give you a\r\nsufficiently clear idea of them[2189]. As they are common to both\r\nsexes, if their use is connected with the sexual intercourse, it\r\nmust be similar to that which Treviranus ascribes to the pectens of\r\nscorpions, they must be instruments of excitement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now, after this long discourse on the External Anatomy and\r\nstructure of these little beings, you may think perhaps at first\r\nthat the subject is exhausted; and that I must have discovered and\r\ndescribed every part and every variation of every part of the crust\r\nof an insect. But when you go on to reflect what a comparatively\r\nsmall number of these creatures have fallen under my examination,\r\nand in those, after all my laborious and painful researches, from\r\nmy limited faculties and other imperfections of our common nature,\r\nhow much will probably have eluded my notice, you may conclude that\r\nthousands of facts still remain concealed to reward the patient\r\nassiduity of future investigators. Such are the immensity and variety\r\nof the works of the CREATOR in this department, that it would require\r\na long life, and fill volumes upon volumes, to discover and give a\r\ndescription of all the peculiarities of structure of the insects that\r\nare already known; and could all that exist[2190] be so studied and\r\nexplained in full detail, the library that the Calif Omar ordered to\r\nbe burned at Alexandria could scarcely have contained more books than\r\nwould be required to receive the results. But \"who is sufficient for\r\nthese things[2191]?\" This is a question that the most able and most\r\nexperienced physiologist must often feel disposed to put to himself\r\nwhen, lost in the intricate labyrinth of the works of his Maker, he\r\nsees all things arranged, \"wheel within wheel,\" in an order that\r\nhe can only _partially_ unravel, instead of tracing the \"regular\r\nconfusion\" through all its windings. But glimpses of light, and\r\npoints of irradiation, here and there discover to _fragments_ of the\r\ntruth of things, and such vestiges of the grand system of the DEITY,\r\nas enable him in some degree to appreciate, and dispose him humbly to\r\nadore that WISDOM, POWER, and GOODNESS, that at first created and now\r\nsustains in its full beauty and harmony the WONDROUS WHOLE.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        END OF THE THIRD VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Printed by Richard Taylor,\r\n    Shoe-Lane, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate VI._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate VII._]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2125] _Anatom.

De\r\nGeer (ii. 833.) describes _Chrysis ignita_ as having _four_ abdominal\r\nrings; but this is only in _appearance_, there being really only\r\n_three_. This appearance is produced by the apex of the last dorsal\r\nsegment being more depressed and marked with several deep little\r\nexcavations that look like holes. In some species of _Stilbum_ this\r\nsegment consists as it were of three ridges or steps.\r\n\r\n[2134] In this genus the ventral segments are replaced by a long\r\nnarrow central plate, succeeded by a minute one.\r\n\r\n[2135] In this genus the bed of the posterior coxæ appears to consist\r\nof two segments, which are beautifully fringed with parallel short\r\nbristles.\r\n\r\n[2136] _Anatom.
