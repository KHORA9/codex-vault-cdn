I sipped my coffee and selected\r\na fresh cigarette from the silver box upon the rug beside me. In this\r\ninterval I had decided that the one-eyed mendicant cherished in his\r\nbosom an implacable and murderous hatred for my genial friend, Ali\r\nMohammed, the dealer in antiques; that he was unaware of my having\r\ndivined his bloody secret; and that if I would profit by my accidental\r\ndiscovery, I must continue to feign complete ignorance of it.\r\n\r\nTurning casually to Ali Mohammed, I was startled to observe the\r\nexpression upon his usually immobile face: he was positively gray,\r\nand I thought I detected a faint rattling sound, apparently produced\r\nby his teeth; his eyes were set as if by hypnosis upon the uncleanly\r\nfigure huddled in the shadow of the low gate.\r\n\r\n\"You are unwell, my friend,\" I said.\r\n\r\nAli Mohammed shook his head feebly, removed his eyes by a palpable\r\neffort from the watcher in the gateway, but almost instantly reverted\r\nagain to that fixed and terrified scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Kernaby Pasha,\" he chattered; \"not in the least.\"\r\n\r\nHe passed a hand rapidly over a brow wet with perspiration, and\r\nmoistened his lips, which were correspondingly dry. I determined upon\r\na diplomatic _tour de force_; I looked him squarely in the face.\r\n\r\n\"For some reason,\" I said distinctly, \"you are in deadly fear of the\r\nwall-eyed mendicant who is sitting by the gate of the Sûk es-Saîgh,\r\nO Ali Mohammed, my friend.\"\r\n\r\nI turned with assumed carelessness. The beggar of murderous appearance\r\nhad vanished, and Ali Mohammed was slowly recovering his composure.\r\nI knew that I must act quickly, or he would deny with the urbane\r\nmendacity of the Egyptian all knowledge of the one-eyed one;\r\ntherefore--\r\n\r\n\"Acquaint me with the reason of your apprehensions,\" I said, at the\r\nsame time offering him one of his own cigarettes; \"it may be that I\r\ncan assist you.\"\r\n\r\nA moment he hesitated, glancing doubtfully in the direction of the\r\ngate and back to my face; then--\r\n\r\n\"It is one of the people of Tîr,\" he whispered, bending close to my\r\near; \"of the evil _ginn_ who are the creatures of Abû Tabâh.\"\r\n\r\nI was puzzled and expressed my doubt in words.\r\n\r\n\"Alas,\" replied Ali Mohammed, \"the Imám Abû Tabâh is neither a man nor\r\nan official; he is a magician.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! then you speak of one bearing the curious name of Abû Tabâh,\r\nwho is at once the holder of a holy office and also one who has\r\ndealings with the _ginn_ and the _Efreets_. This is strange, Ali\r\nMohammed, my friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is strange and terrible,\" he whispered, \"and I fear that my path\r\nis beset with pitfalls and slopeth down to desolation.\" He pronounced\r\nthe _Takbîr_, \"_Alláhu akbar!_\" and uttered the words \"_Hadeed! yá\r\nmashûm!_\" (Iron! thou unlucky!), a potent invocation, as the _ginn's_\r\ndread of that metal is well known. \"There are things of which one may\r\nnot speak,\" he declared; \"and this is one of them.\"\r\n\r\nSorely puzzled as I was by this most mysterious happening, yet,\r\nbecause of the pious words of my friend, I knew that the incident was\r\nclosed so far as confidences were concerned; and I presently took my\r\ndeparture, my mind filled with all sorts of odd conjectures by which I\r\nsought to explain the matter. I was used to the superstitions of that\r\nquarter where almost every gate and every second street has its\r\nguardian _ginnee_, but who and what was Abû Tabâh? An Imám,\r\napparently, though to what mosque attached Ali Mohammed had not\r\nmentioned. And why did Ali Mohammed fear Abû Tabâh?\r\n\r\nSo my thoughts ran, more or less ungoverned, whilst I made my way\r\nthrough streets narrow and tortuous in the direction of the Rondpoint\r\ndu Mûski. I saw no more of the wall-eyed mendicant; but in a court\r\nhard by the Mosque of el-Ashraf I found myself in the midst of a\r\nsquabbling crowd of natives surrounding someone whom I gathered, from\r\nthe direction of their downward glances, to be prone upon the ground.\r\nSince the byways of the Sûk el-Attârin are little frequented by\r\nEuropeans, at midday, I thrust my way into the heart of the throng,\r\nthinking that some stray patron of Messrs. Cook and Son (Egypt, Ltd.)\r\nmight possibly have got into trouble or have been overcome by the\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nWho or what lay at the heart of that gathering I never learned. I was\r\nstill some distance from the centre of the disturbance when an\r\nevil-smelling sack was whipped over my head and shoulders from behind,\r\na hand clapped upon my mouth and jaws; and, lifted in muscular arms,\r\nI found myself being borne inarticulate down stone steps, as I gathered\r\nfrom the sound, into some cool cellar-like place.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIn my capacity as Egyptian representative of Messrs. Moses, Murphy &\r\nCo., of Birmingham, I have sometimes found myself in awkward corners;\r\nbut in Cairo, whether the native or European quarter, I had hitherto\r\ncounted myself as safe as in London and safer than in Paris. The\r\nunexpectedness of the present outrage would have been sufficient to\r\ntake my breath away without the agency of the filthy sack, which had\r\napparently contained garlic at some time and now contained my head.\r\n\r\nI was deposited upon a stone-paved floor and my wrists were neatly\r\npinioned behind me by one of my captors, whilst another hung on to my\r\nankles. The sack was raised from my body but not from my face; and\r\nwhilst a hand was kept firmly pressed over the region of my mouth,\r\nnimble fingers turned my pockets inside out. I assumed at first that I\r\nhad fallen into the clutches of some modern brethren of the famous\r\nForty, but when my purse, note-case, pocket-book, and other belongings\r\nwere returned to me, I realized that something more underlay this\r\nattempt than the mere activity of a gang of footpads.\r\n\r\nAt this conclusion I had just arrived when the stinking sack was\r\npulled off entirely and I found myself sitting on the floor of a small\r\nand very dark cellar. Beside me, holding the sack in his huge hands,\r\nstood a pock-marked negro of most repulsive appearance, and before me,\r\nhis slim, ivory-colored hands crossed and resting upon the head of an\r\nebony cane, was a man, apparently an Egyptian, whose appearance had\r\nsomething so strange about it that the angry words which I had been\r\nprepared to utter died upon my tongue and I sat staring mutely into\r\nthe face of my captor; for I could not doubt that the outrage had been\r\ndictated by this man's will.\r\n\r\nHe was, then, a young man, probably under thirty, with perfectly\r\nchiseled features and a slight black moustache. He wore a black\r\n_gibbeh_, and a white turban, and brown shoes upon his small feet. His\r\nface was that of an ascetic, nor had I ever seen more wonderful and\r\nliquid eyes; in them reposed a world of melancholy; yet his red lips\r\nwere parted in a smile tender as that of a mother. Inclining his head\r\nin a gesture of gentle dignity, this man--whom I hated at\r\nsight--addressed me in Arabic.\r\n\r\n\"I am desolated,\" he said, \"and there is no comfort in my heart\r\nbecause of that which has happened to you by my orders. If it is\r\npossible for me to recompense you by any means within my power,\r\ncommand and you shall find a slave.\"\r\n\r\nHe was poisonously suave. Beneath the placid exterior, beneath the\r\nsugar-lipped utterances, in the deeps of the gazelle-like eyes, was\r\nhid a cold and remorseless spirit for which the man's silken demeanor\r\nwas but a cloak. I hated him more and more. But my trade--for I do not\r\nblush to own myself a tradesman--has taught me caution. My ankles were\r\nfree, it is true, but my hands were still tied behind me and over me\r\ntowered the hideous bulk of the negro. This might be modern Cairo, and\r\nno doubt there were British troops quartered at the Citadel and at\r\nthe Kasr en-Nîl; probably there was a native policeman, a\r\nrepresentative of twentieth-century law and order, somewhere in the\r\nmaze of streets surrounding me: but, in the first place, I was at a\r\nphysical disadvantage, in the second place I had reasons for not\r\ndesiring unduly to intrude my affairs upon official notice, and in the\r\nthird place some hazy idea of what might be behind all this business\r\nhad begun to creep into my mind.\r\n\r\n\"Have I the pleasure,\" I said, and electing to speak, not in Arabic\r\nbut in English, \"of addressing the _Imám Abû Tabâh_?\"\r\n\r\nI could have sworn that despite his amazing self-control the man\r\nstarted slightly; but the lapse, if lapse it were, was but momentary.\r\nHe repeated the dignified obeisance of the head--and answered me in\r\nEnglish as pure as my own.\r\n\r\n\"I am called Abû Tabâh,\" he said; \"and if I assure you that my\r\ndiscourteous treatment was dictated by a mistaken idea of duty, and if\r\nI offer you this explanation as the only apology possible, will you\r\npermit me to untie your hands and call an _arabîyeh_ to drive you to\r\nyour hotel?\"\r\n\r\n\"No apology is necessary,\" I assured him. \"Had I returned direct to\r\nShepheard's I should have arrived too early for luncheon; and the odor\r\nof garlic, which informed the sack that your zeal for duty caused to\r\nbe clapped upon my head, is one for which I have a certain penchant if\r\nit does not amount to a passion.\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh smiled, inclined his head again, and slightly raising the\r\nebony cane indicated my pinioned wrists, at the same time glancing at\r\nthe negro. In a trice I was unbound and once more upon my feet. I\r\nlooked at the dilapidated door which gave access to the cellar, and I\r\nmade a rapid mental calculation of the approximate weight in pounds of\r\nthe large negro; then I looked hard at Abû Tabâh--who smilingly met my\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\"Any one of my servants,\" he said urbanely, \"who wait in the adjoining\r\nroom, will order you an _arabîyeh_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWhen the card of Ali Mohammed was brought to me that evening, my\r\nthoughts instantly flew to the wall-eyed mendicant of the Sûk\r\nen-Nahhasîn, and to Abû Tabâh, the sugar-lipped. I left the pleasant\r\ncompany of the two charming American ladies with whom I had been\r\nchatting on the terrace and joined Ali Mohammed in the lounge.\r\n\r\nWithout undue preamble he poured his tale of woe into my sympathetic\r\nears. He had been lured away from his shop later that afternoon, and,\r\nin his absence, someone had ransacked the place from floor to roof.\r\nThat night on his way to his abode, somewhere out Shubra direction I\r\nunderstood, he had been attacked and searched, finally to reach his\r\nhouse and to find there a home in wild disorder.\r\n\r\n\"I fear for my life,\" he whispered and glanced about the lounge in\r\nblackest apprehension; \"yet where in all Cairo may I find an\r\nintermediary whom I can trust? Suppose,\" he pursued, and dropped his\r\nvoice yet lower, \"that a commission of ten per cent--say, one hundred\r\npounds, English--were to be earned, should you care, Kernaby Pasha,\r\nto earn it?\"\r\n\r\nI assured him that I should regard such a proposal with the utmost\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\"It would be necessary,\" he continued, \"for you to disguise yourself\r\nas an aged woman and to visit the _harêm_ of a certain wealthy Bey.\r\nI have a ring which must be shown to the _bowwab_ at the gate of the\r\n_harêm_ gardens upon which you would knock three times slowly and then\r\ntwice rapidly. You would collect the thousand _ginêh_ agreed upon and\r\nwould deliver to a certain lady a sandalwood box, the possession of\r\nwhich endangers my life and has brought about me the hosts of Abû\r\nTabâh the magician.\"\r\n\r\nSo the head of the cat was out of the bag at last. But there was more\r\nto come and it was not a proposition to plunge at, as I immediately\r\nperceived; and I parted from Ali Mohammed upon the prudent\r\nunderstanding that I should acquaint him with my decision on the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nThe terrace of Shepheard's was deserted, when, having escorted my\r\nvisitor to the door, he made his way down into the Shâria Kâmel Pasha.\r\nTwo white-robed figures who looked like hotel servants, and a little\r\nnondescript group of natives, stood at the foot of the steps. At the\r\ninstant that doubt entered my mind and too late to warn the worthy\r\nAli Mohammed, the group parted to give him passage; then ... a\r\nterrific scuffle was in progress and one of the wealthiest merchants\r\nof the Mûski was being badly hustled.\r\n\r\nI ran down the steps, the carriage-despatcher and some other\r\nofficials, whom the disturbance had aroused from their secret lairs,\r\nappearing almost simultaneously. As I reached the street, out from the\r\nfeet of the wrestling throng, like a football from a scrum, rolled a\r\nneat _tarbûsh_.\r\n\r\nAutomatically I stooped and picked it up. Its weight surprised me.\r\nThen, glancing inside the _tarbûsh_, I perceived that a little oblong\r\nbox, together with a quaint signet ring, were ingeniously attached to\r\nthe crown by means of silk threads tied around the knot of the tassel.\r\nI glanced rapidly about me. I, alone, had seen the cap roll out upon\r\nthe pavement.\r\n\r\nA hard jerk, and I had the box and the ring free in my hand. The tall\r\ncarriage-despatcher, his ferocious efforts now seconded by a native\r\npoliceman who freely employed his cane upon the thinly-clad persons of\r\nthe group, had terminated the scuffle.\r\n\r\nRight and left active figures darted, pursued for some little distance\r\nby the policeman and the two men from the hotel. There were no\r\ncaptures.\r\n\r\nA very dusty and bemused Ali Mohammed, his shaven skull robbing him of\r\nmuch of the dignity which belonged to his _tarbûsh_, confronted me,\r\nruefully dusting his garments.\r\n\r\n\"Your _tarbûsh_, my friend,\" I said, restoring his property to him\r\nwith a bow.\r\n\r\nOne piercing glance he cast into the interior, then--\r\n\r\n\"O Allah!\" he wailed--\"O Allah! I am robbed! Yet----\"\r\n\r\nA sort of martyred resignation, a beatific peace, crept over his\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n\"To war against Abû Tabâh is the act of a fool,\" he declared. \"To have\r\nobtained the Bey's money would have been good, but to have obtained\r\npeace is better!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI awoke that night from a troubled sleep and from a dream wherein\r\nmagnetic fingers caressed my forehead hypnotically. For a moment I\r\ncould not believe that I was truly awake; the long ivory hand of my\r\ndreams was still moving close before me with a sort of slow fanning\r\nmovement--and other, nimble, fingers crept beneath my pillow!\r\n\r\nOf my distaste for impulse I have already spoken, and even now, with\r\nmy mind not wholly under control, I profited by those years of\r\nself-imposed discipline. Without fully opening my eyes, cautiously,\r\ninch by inch, I moved my hand to that side of the bed nearer to the\r\nwall, where there reposed a leather holster containing my pistol.\r\n\r\nMy fingers closed over the butt of the weapon; and in a flash I\r\nbecame wide awake ... and had the ring of the barrel within an inch of\r\nthe smiling face of Abû Tabâh!\r\n\r\nI sat up.\r\n\r\n\"Be good enough, my friend,\" I said, \"to turn on the center lamp. The\r\nswitch, as you have probably noted, is immediately to the left of the\r\ndoor.\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh, straightening his figure and withdrawing his hand from\r\nbeneath my pillow, inclined his picturesque head in grave salute and\r\nmoved stately in the direction indicated. The room was flooded with\r\nyellow light. Its disorder was appalling; apparently no item of my\r\ngear had escaped attention.\r\n\r\n\"Pray take a seat,\" I said; \"this one close beside me.\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh gravely accepted the invitation.\r\n\r\n\"This is the second occasion,\" I continued, \"upon which you have\r\nunwarrantably submitted me to a peculiar form of outrage----\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unwarrantably,\" replied Abû Tabâh, his speech suave and gentle;\r\n\"but I fear I am too late!\"\r\n\r\nHis words came as a beam of enlightenment. At last I had the game in\r\nmy hands did I but play my cards with moderate cunning.\r\n\r\n\"You must pursue your inquiries in the _harêm_ of the Bey,\" I said.\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"The house of Yûssuf Bey has been watched,\" he replied; \"therefore my\r\nagents have failed me and must be punished.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are guiltless. It was humanly impossible to perceive my entrance\r\nto the house,\" I declared truthfully.\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh smiled into my face.\r\n\r\n\"So it was _you_ who carried the sacred _burko_ of the Seyyîdeh\r\nNefîseh,\" he said; \"and to-night Ali Mohammed brought you the reward\r\nfor your perilous journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your reasoning is sound,\" I replied, \"and the accuracy of your\r\ninformation remarkable.\"\r\n\r\nI had scored the first point in the game; for I had learned that the\r\nwonderful silken _yashmak_, pearl embroidered, which I had found in\r\nthe sandalwood box, was no less a curiosity than the face-veil of the\r\nSeyyîdeh Nefîseh and must therefore be of truly astounding antiquity\r\nand unique of its kind.\r\n\r\n\"The woman Sháhmarâh,\" continued my midnight visitor, the eerie light\r\nof fanaticism dawning in his eyes, \"who was once a dancing girl, and\r\nwho will ruin Yûssuf Bey as she ruined Ghûri Pasha before him, must be\r\nfor ever accursed and meet with the fate of courtesans if she dare to\r\nwear the _burko_ of Nefîseh.\"\r\n\r\nI had scored my second point; I had learned that the lady to whom Ali\r\nMohammed would have had me deliver the _yashmak_ was named Sháhmarâh\r\nand was evidently the favorite of the notorious Yûssuf Bey. The\r\ncomplacent self-satisfaction of Abû Tabâh amused me vastly, for he\r\nclearly entertained no doubts respecting his efficiency as a searcher.\r\n\r\nHe was watching me now with his strange hypnotic eyes, which had\r\nsoftened again, and his fixed stare caused me a certain uneasiness.\r\nFor a captured thief, sitting covered by the pistol of his captor,\r\nhe was ridiculously composed.\r\n\r\n\"You have performed an immoral deed,\" he said sweetly, \"and have\r\npandered to the base desires of a woman of poor repute. I offer you an\r\nopportunity of performing a good deed--and of trebling your profit.\"\r\n\r\nThis was as I would have it, and I nodded encouragingly.\r\n\r\n\"Unfold to me the thing that is in your mind,\" I directed him.\r\n\r\n\"I am a Moslem,\" he said; \"and although Yûssuf Bey is a dog of dogs,\r\nhe is nevertheless a True Believer--and I may not force my way into\r\nhis _harêm_.\"\r\n\r\n\"He might return the veil if he knew that Sháhmarâh had it,\"\r\nI suggested ingenuously.\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"There are difficulties,\" he replied, \"and if the theft is not to\r\nbe proclaimed to the world, there is no time to be lost. This is my\r\nproposal: Return to the woman Sháhmarâh, and acquaint her with the\r\nfact that the sacred veil has been traced to her abode and her death\r\ndecided upon by the Grand Mufti if it be not given up. Force the\r\nmerchant Ali Mohammed to return the money received by him, using the\r\nsame threat--which will prove a talisman of power. Return to the\r\ninfidel woman the full amount; I will make good your commission,\r\nto which, if you be successful, I will add two hundred pounds.\"\r\n\r\nI performed some rapid thinking.\r\n\r\n\"You must give me a little time to consider this matter,\" I said.\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh graciously inclined his head.\r\n\r\n\"On Tuesday next a company of holy men who have journeyed hither from\r\nIspahân, go to view this relic; you have therefore five days to act.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I decline?\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"The loss must be made known--it would be a great scandal; the\r\nmerchant Ali Mohammed, and the woman, Sháhmarâh, must be\r\narrested--very undesirable; _you_ must be arrested--most undesirable;\r\nand your banking account will be poorer by three hundred pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frightfully undesirable,\" I declared. \"But suppose I strike the first\r\nblow and give you in charge of the police here and now?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may try the experiment,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI waved my hand in the direction of the door (I had reasons for\r\nremaining in bed). \"_Ma'salâma!_ (Good-bye),\" I said. \"Don't stay to\r\nrestore the room to order. I shall expect you early in the morning.\r\nYou will find the door of the hotel open any time after eight and I\r\ncan highly recommend it as a mode of entrance.\"\r\n\r\nHaving saluted me with both hands, Abû Tabâh made his stately\r\ndeparture, leaving me much exercised in mind as to how he proposed to\r\naccount to the _bowwab_ for his sudden appearance in the building.\r\nThis, however, was no affair of mine, and, first reclosing the window,\r\nI unfastened from around my left ankle the sandalwood box and the ring\r\nwhich I had bound there by a piece of tape--a device to which I owed\r\ntheir preservation from the subtle fingers of Abû Tabâh. Furthermore,\r\nto their presence there I owed my having awakened when I did. I am\r\npersuaded that the mysterious Egyptian's passes would have continued\r\nto keep me in a profound sleep had it not been for the pain occasioned\r\nby the pressure of the tape.\r\n\r\nOpening the sandalwood box, and then the silver one which it enclosed,\r\nI re-examined the really wonderful specimen of embroidery whereof they\r\nformed the reliquary. The _burko_ was of Tussur silk, its texture so\r\nfine that the whole veil, which was some four feet long by two wide,\r\nmight have been passed through the finger ring and would readily be\r\nconcealed in the palm of the hand.\r\n\r\nIt was of unusual form, having no forehead band, more nearly\r\nresembling a _yashmak_ than a true _burko_, and was heavily\r\nembroidered with pearls of varying sizes and purity, although none of\r\nthem were large. Its intrinsic value was considerable, but in view of\r\nits history such a valuation must have fallen far below the true one.\r\nWhen its loss became known, I estimated that Messrs. Moses, Murphy &\r\nCo. could readily dispose of three duplicates through various channels\r\nto wealthy collectors whose enthusiasms were greater than their\r\nmorality. The sale to a museum, or to the lawful owners, of the\r\noriginal (known technically as \"the model\") would crown a sound\r\ncommercial transaction.\r\n\r\nCock-crow that morning discovered me at the private residence, in the\r\nBoulevard Clot-Bey, of one Suleyman Levi, with whom I had had minor\r\ndealings in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock on the following Monday night, an old Egyptian woman,\r\nenveloped from head to foot in a black _tôb_ and wearing a black crêpe\r\nface-veil boasting a hideous brass nose-piece, halted before a doorway\r\nset in the wall guarding the great gardens of the palace of Yûssuf\r\nBey. I was the impersonator of this decrepit female. Abû Tabâh, who\r\nthus far had accompanied me, stepped into the dense shadow of the\r\nopposite wall and was thereby swallowed up.\r\n\r\nI rapped three times slowly upon the doorway, then twice rapidly.\r\nAlmost at once a little wicket therein flew open, and a bloated negro\r\nface showed framed in the square aperture.\r\n\r\n\"The messenger from Ali Mohammed of the Sûk en-Nahhasîn,\" I said, in\r\na croaky voice. \"Conduct me to the Lady Sháhmarâh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Show her seal,\" answered the eunuch, extending through the opening\r\na large, fat hand.\r\n\r\nI gave him the ring so fortunately discovered in the _tarbûsh_ of my\r\nfriend the merchant and the hand was withdrawn. Within a colloquy took\r\nplace in which a female voice took part. Then the door was partly\r\nopened for my admittance--and I found myself in the gardens of the\r\nBey.\r\n\r\nIn the moonlight it was a place of wonder, an enchanted demesne; but\r\nmore like an Edmond Dulac water-color than a real garden. The palace\r\nwith its magnificent _mushrabîyeh_ windows, so poetically symbolical\r\nof veiled women, guarded by several fine, straight-limbed palm trees,\r\nspoke of the Old Cairo which saw the birth of _The Arabian Nights_\r\nand which so many of us imagine to have vanished with the _khalîfate_.\r\n\r\nA girl completely muffled up in many-hued shawls and scarves, so that\r\nher red-slippered feet and two bright eyes heavily darkened with\r\n_kohl_ were the only two portions of her person visible, stood before\r\nme, her figure seeming childish beside that of the gross negro--whom\r\nI hated at sight because he reminded me of the one whom I had\r\nencountered in Abû Tabâh's cellar.\r\n\r\n\"Follow me, quickly, mother,\" said the girl. \"You\"--pointing\r\nimperiously at the black man--\"remain here.\"\r\n\r\nI followed her in silence, noting that she pursued a path which ran\r\nparallel with the wall and lay wholly in its shadow. The gardens were\r\nfragrant with the perfume of roses, and in the center was a huge\r\nmarble fountain surrounded by kiosks projecting into the water, tall\r\nacacias overshadowing them. We skirted two sides of the palace, its\r\n_mushrabîyeh_ windows mysteriously lighted by the moon but showing no\r\nillumination from within. There we came to the entrance to a kind of\r\ntrellis-covered walk, mosaic paved and patched delightfully with\r\nmystic light. It terminated before a small but heavy and nail-studded\r\ndoor, of which my guide held the key.\r\n\r\nEntering, whilst she held the door ajar, I found myself in utter\r\ndarkness, to be almost immediately dispelled by the yellow gleam of\r\na lamp which the girl took from some niche, wherein, already lighted,\r\nit had been concealed. Up a flight of bare wooden stairs she conducted\r\nme, and opened a second prison-like door at their head. Leaving the\r\nlamp upon the top step, she pushed me gently forward into a small,\r\noctagonal room, paneled in dark wood inlaid with mother-o'-pearl and\r\nreminding me of the interior of a magnified _kursee_ or coffee table.\r\n\r\nRugs and carpets strewed the floor and the air was heavy with the\r\nsmell of musk, a perfume which I detest, it having characterized the\r\npersonality of a certain Arab lady who sold me so marvelous a Damascus\r\nscimitar that I was utterly deceived by it until too late.\r\n\r\nRaising a heavy curtain draped in a door shaped like an old-fashioned\r\nkeyhole, and embellished with an intricate mass of fretwork carving,\r\nmy guide went out, leaving me alone with my reflections. This interval\r\nwas very brief, however, and was terminated by the reappearance of the\r\ngirl, who this time made her entrance through a second doorway masked\r\nby the paneling. A faint musical splashing sound greeted me through\r\nthe opening; and when my guide beckoned me to enter and I obeyed,\r\nI found myself in a chamber of barbaric beauty and in the presence\r\nof the celebrated Sháhmarâh.\r\n\r\nThe apartment, save for one end being wholly occupied by a magnificent\r\n_mushrabîyeh_ screen, was walled with what looked like Verde Antico\r\nmarble or green serpentine. An ebony couch having feet shaped as those\r\nof a leopard and enriched with gleaming bronze, having the skins of\r\nleopards cast across it, and, upon the skins, silken soft cushions\r\nwrought in patterns of green and gold, stood upon the mosaic floor at\r\nthe head of three shallow steps which descended to a pool where a\r\nfountain played, softly musical; wherein lurked gleaming shapes of\r\nsilver and gold. Bright mats were strewn around, and at one corner of\r\nthe pool a huge silver _mibkharah_ sent up its pencilings of aromatic\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nUpon this couch Sháhmarâh reclined, and I perceived immediately that\r\nher reputation for beauty was richly deserved. There was something\r\nleopardine in her pliant shape, which seemed to harmonize with the\r\nfierce black and gold of the skins upon which she was stretched; she\r\nhad the limbs of a Naiad and the eyes of an Egyptian Circe. Upon her\r\nhead she wore a _rabtah_, or turban, of pure white, secured and\r\ndecorated in front by a brooch of ancient Egyptian enamel-work\r\nprobably fourteenth dynasty, and for which I would gladly have given\r\nher one hundred pounds. If I have forgotten what else she wore it may\r\nbe because my senses were in somewhat of a turmoil as I stood before\r\nher in that opulent apartment--which I suddenly recognized, and not\r\nwithout discomfiture, to be the _meslakh_ of the _hammám_. I can only\r\nrelate, then, that the image left upon my mind was one of jewels and\r\ndusky peach-like loveliness. Jewels there were in abundance, clasped\r\nabout the warm curves of her arms and overloading her fingers; she\r\nwore gold bands thickly encrusted with gems about her ankles (the slim\r\nankles of a dancing girl); and a fiery ruby of the true pigeon's-blood\r\ncolor gleamed upon the first toe of her left foot, the nails of which\r\nwere highly manicured and stained with henna.\r\n\r\nFixing her wonderful eyes upon me--\r\n\r\n\"You have brought the veil?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"The merchant Ali Mohammed ordered me to convey to him the price\r\nagreed upon, O jewel of Egypt,\" I mumbled, \"ere I yielded up this a\r\npoor man's only treasure.\"\r\n\r\nSháhmarâh sat upright upon the couch. Her delicate brows were drawn\r\ntogether in a frown, and her eyes, rendered doubly luminous by the\r\npigment with which they were surrounded, glared fiercely at me, whilst\r\nshe stamped one bare foot upon a cushion lying on the mosaic floor.\r\n\r\n\"The veil!\" she cried imperiously. \"I will send the merchant Ali\r\nMohammed an order on the treasury of the Bey.\"\r\n\r\n\"O moon of the Orient,\" I replied, \"O ravisher of souls, I am but a\r\npoor ugly old woman basking in the radiance of beauty and loveliness.\r\nWould you ruin one so old and feeble and helpless? I must have the\r\nprice agreed upon; let it be counted into this bag\"--and concealing\r\nmy tell-tale hands as much as possible, I bent humbly and placed a\r\nleather wallet upon a little table beside her which bore fruits,\r\nsweetmeats, and a long-necked gold flagon. \"When it is done, the\r\n_yashmak_ of pearls, which only thy dazzling perfection might dare to\r\nwear, shall be yielded up to thee, O daughter of musk and ambergris.\"\r\n\r\nThere fell a short silence, wherein the fountain musically plashed and\r\nSháhmarâh shot little inquiring glances laden with venom into the\r\nmists of my black veil, and others which held a query over my shoulder\r\nat her confidant.\r\n\r\n\"I might have you cast into a dungeon beneath this palace,\" she hissed\r\nat me, bending lithely forward and extending a jeweled forefinger. \"No\r\none would miss thee, O mother of afflictions.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that event,\" I crooned quaveringly, \"O tree of pearls, the veil\r\ncould never be thine; for the merchant Ali Mohammed, who awaits me at\r\nthe gate, refuses to deliver it up until the price agreed upon has\r\nbeen placed in his hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a Jew, and a son of Jews, who eats without washing! a devourer\r\nof pork, and an unclean insect,\" she cried.\r\n\r\nShe extended the jeweled hand towards the girl who stood behind me\r\nand who, having loosened her wraps, proved to be a comely but\r\nshrewd-looking Assyrian. \"Let the money be counted into the bag,\"\r\nshe ordered, \"that we may be rid of the presence of this garrulous\r\nand hideous old hag.\"\r\n\r\n\"O fountain of justice,\" I exclaimed; \"O peerless _houri_, to behold\r\nwhom is to swoon with delight and rapture.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a locked closet the Assyrian girl took a wooden coffer, and\r\nbefore my gratified eyes began to count out upon the little table\r\nnotes and gold until a pile lay there to have choked a miser with\r\nemotion. (The ready-money transactions of the East have always\r\ndelighted me.) But, with the chinking of the last piece of gold upon\r\nthe pile--\r\n\r\n\"There is no more,\" said the girl. \"It is one hundred pounds short.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is more than enough!\" cried Sháhmarâh. \"I am ruined. Give me the\r\nveil and go.\"\r\n\r\n\"O vision of paradise,\" I exclaimed in anguish, \"the merchant Ali\r\nMohammed would never consent. In lieu of the remainder\"--I pointed to\r\nthe antique enamel in her turban--\"give me the brooch from thy\r\n_rabtah_.\"\r\n\r\n\"O sink of corruption!\" was her response, her whole body positively\r\nquivering with rage, \"it is not for thy filthy claws. Here!\"--she\r\npulled a ring containing a fair-sized emerald from one of her fingers\r\nand tossed it contemptuously upon the pile of money--\"thou art more\r\nthan repaid. The veil! the veil!\"\r\n\r\nI turned to the girl who had counted out the gold.\r\n\r\n\"O minor moon, whom even the glory of paradise cannot dim,\" I said,\r\n\"put the money in the wallet, for my hands are old and infirm, and\r\ngive it to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Assyrian scooped the gold and notes into the leather bag with\r\nthe utmost unconcern, and as though she had been shelling peas into\r\na basket. The profound disregard for wealth exhibited in the _harêm_\r\nof Yûssuf Bey was extraordinary; and I mentally endorsed the opinion\r\nexpressed by Abû Tabâh that the ruin of the Bey was imminent.\r\n\r\nSecuring the heavy wallet to the girdle which I wore beneath my\r\nveilings, I placed upon the table where the money had lain a small\r\nsilken packet.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the veil,\" I said; \"for my story of the merchant, Ali\r\nMohammed, who had refused to yield it up, was but a stratagem to\r\ntest the generosity of thy soul, as thy refusal to give me the\r\nprice agreed upon was but a subterfuge to test my honesty.\"\r\n\r\nHeedless of the words, Sháhmarâh snatched up the packet, tore off the\r\nwrappings, and in a trice was standing upright before me wearing the\r\n_yashmak_ of pearls.\r\n\r\nI think I had never seen a figure more barbarically lovely than that\r\nof this soulless Egyptian so adorned.\r\n\r\n\"My mirror, Sáfiyeh! my mirror!\" she cried.\r\n\r\nAnd the girl placing a big silver mirror in her hand, she stood there\r\nlooking into its surface, her wonderful eyes swimming with ecstasy and\r\nher slim body swaying in a perfect rapture of admiration for her own\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she dropped the mirror upon the cushions and threw wide her\r\narms.\r\n\r\n\"Am I not the fairest woman in Egypt?\" she exclaimed. \"I tread upon\r\nthe hearts of men and my power is above the power of kings!\"\r\n\r\nThen a subtle change crept over her features; and ere I could utter\r\nthe first of the honeyed compliments ready upon my tongue--\r\n\r\n\"Send Amineh to warn Mahmûd that the old woman is about to depart,\"\r\nshe directed her attendant; and, turning to me: \"Wait in the outer\r\nroom. Thy presence is loathsome to me, O mother of calamities.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear and obey,\" I replied, \"O pomegranate blossom\"--and, following\r\nthe direction of her rigidly extended finger, I shuffled back to the\r\nlittle octagonal apartment and the masked door was slammed almost upon\r\nmy heels.\r\n\r\nThis room, which possessed no windows, was solely illuminated by a\r\nsilken-shaded lantern, but I had not long to wait in that weird\r\nhalf-light ere my conductress, again closely muffled in her shawls,\r\nopened the door at the head of the steps and signed to me to descend.\r\n\r\n\"Lead the way, my beautiful daughter,\" I said; for I had no intention\r\nof submitting myself to the risk of a dagger in the back.\r\n\r\nShe consented without demur, which served to allay my suspicions\r\nsomewhat, and in silence we went down the uncarpeted stairs and out\r\ninto the trellis-covered walk. The shadow beneath the high wall had\r\ndeepened and widened since we had last skirted the gardens, and I\r\nfelt my way along with my hand cautiously outstretched.\r\n\r\nAt a point within sight of the flower-grown arbor beneath which I\r\nknew the gate to be concealed, my guide halted.\r\n\r\n\"I must return, mother,\" she said quickly. \"There is the gate, and\r\nMahmûd will open it for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, O daughter of the willow branch,\" I replied. \"May Allah,\r\nthe Great, the Compassionate, be with thee, and may thou marry a\r\nprince of Persia.\"\r\n\r\nLight of foot she sped away, and, my forebodings coming to a sudden\r\nclimax, I crept forward with excessive caution, holding my clenched\r\nhand immediately in front of my face--a device which experience of\r\nthe hospitable manners of the East had taught me.\r\n\r\nIt was well that I did so. Within three spaces of the gate a noose\r\nfell accurately over my head and was drawn tight with a strangling\r\njerk!\r\n\r\nBut that it also encircled my upraised arm, its clasp must have\r\nterminated my worldly affairs.\r\n\r\nMy assailant had sprung upon me from behind; and, in the fleeting\r\ninstant between the fall of the noose and its tightening, I turned\r\nabout ... and thrust the nose of my Colt repeater (which I grasped in\r\nthat protective upraised hand) fully into the grinning mouth of the\r\nnegro gate-keeper!\r\n\r\nThere was a rattle and gleam of falling ivory, for several of the\r\n_bowwab's_ teeth had been dislodged by the steel barrel. Keeping the\r\nweapon firmly thrust into the man's distended jaws, I circled around\r\nhim, whilst his hands relaxed their hold upon the strangling-cord,\r\nand pushed him backward in the direction of the door.\r\n\r\n\"Open thou black son of offal!\" I said, \"or I will blow thee a cavity\r\nas wide as thy blubber mouth through the back of that fat and greasy\r\nneck! This was, no doubt, a stratagem of thy mistress to test my\r\nfitness to be entrusted with large sums of money?\"\r\n\r\nWhen, a few moments later, I stood in the lane outside the gardens\r\nof Yûssuf Bey, and felt with my hand the fat wallet at my waist,\r\nI experienced a thrill of professional satisfaction, for had I not\r\nsuccessfully negotiated a duplicate veil, embroidered with imitation\r\npearls which the excellent Suleyman Levi by dint of four days of\r\nalmost ceaseless toil had made for me?...\r\n\r\nFrom the shadows of the opposite wall Abû Tabâh stepped forth,\r\nstately.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" I said. \"I fear pursuit at any moment! Is the _arabîyeh_\r\nwaiting?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have it?\" he demanded, some faint sign of human animation\r\ncreeping over his impassive face.\r\n\r\n\"I have!\" I replied. \"I will give it to you in the _arabîyeh_.\"\r\n\r\nSide by side we passed down the deserted thoroughfare to where, beside\r\na solitary palm, a pair-horse carriage was waiting. Appreciating\r\nsomething of my companion's natural impatience, I pressed into his\r\nhand the famous sandalwood box which once had reposed in the _tarbûsh_\r\nof Ali Mohammed. The carriage rolled around a corner and out into the\r\nlighted Shâria Mobâdayân. Abû Tabâh opened the sandalwood box, and\r\nthen, reverently, the inner box of silver. Within shimmered the pearls\r\nof the sacred _burko_. He did not touch the relic with his hands, but\r\nreclosed the boxes and concealed the reliquary beneath his black robe.\r\nI heard the crackle of notes; and a little packet surrounded by a band\r\nof elastic was pressed into my hand.\r\n\r\n\"Three hundred pounds, English,\" said Abû Tabâh. \"One hundred pounds\r\nin recompense for the commission you returned, and two hundred pounds\r\nfor the recovery of the relic.\"\r\n\r\nI thrust the wad into the bag beneath my robe containing the other\r\nspoils of the evening. A second and even more grateful glow of\r\nprofessional joy warmed my heart. For in the reliquary which I had\r\nhanded to Abû Tabâh reposed the second product of Suleyman Levi's\r\nscientific toils; his four days' labor having resulted in the\r\nproduction of two quite passable duplicates; although neither were by\r\nany means up to the standard of Messrs. Moses, Murphy & Co.\r\n\r\nComing to the house wherein I had endued my disguise, Abû Tabâh left\r\nme to metamorphose myself into a decently dressed Englishman suitable\r\nfor admission to an hotel of international repute.\r\n\r\n\"_Lîltâk sa'îda_, Abû Tabâh,\" I said.\r\n\r\nIn the open doorway he turned.\r\n\r\n\"_Lîltâk sa'îda_, Kernaby Pasha,\" he replied, and smiled upon me very\r\nsweetly.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIt was after midnight when I returned to Shepheard's, but I went\r\nstraight to my room, and switching on the table-lamp, wrote a long\r\nletter to my principals. Something seemed to have gone wrong with the\r\nlock of my attaché-case, and my good humor was badly out of joint by\r\nthe time that I succeeded in opening it. From underneath a mass of\r\nbusiness correspondence I took out a large, sealed envelope, which I\r\nenclosed with a letter in one yet larger, to be registered to Messrs.\r\nMoses, Murphy & Co., Birmingham, in the morning. I turned in utterly\r\ntired but happy, to dream complacently of the smile of Abû Tabâh and\r\nof the party of holy men who had journeyed from Ispahân.\r\n\r\nExactly a fortnight later the following registered letter was handed\r\nto me as I was about to sit down to lunch--\r\n\r\n  The Hon. Neville Kernaby.\r\n    Shepheard's Hotel,\r\n      Cairo, Egypt.\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. NEVILLE KERNABY--\r\n\r\n  We are returning herewith the silken veil which you describe as \"the\r\n  authentic _burko_ of the Seyyîdeh Nefîseh, stolen from her shrine in\r\n  the Tombs of the Khalîfs.\" Your statement that you can arrange for its\r\n  purchase at the cost of one thousand pounds does not interest us, nor\r\n  do we expect so high-salaried an expert as yourself to send us\r\n  palpable and very inferior forgeries. We are manufacturers of\r\n  duplicates, not buyers of same.\r\n\r\n             Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                 LLOYD LLEWELLYN.\r\n\r\n     (For Messrs. Moses, Murphy & Co.).\r\n\r\nI was positively aghast. Tearing open the enclosed package, I glared\r\nlike a madman at the _yashmak_ which it contained. The silk, in\r\ncomparison with that of which the real veil was compared, was coarse\r\nas cocoanut matting; the embroidery was crude; the pearls shrieked\r\n\"imitation\" aloud! At a glance I knew the thing for one of the pair\r\nmade by Suleyman Levi!\r\n\r\nThe truth crashed in upon my mind. Following my visit to the _harêm_\r\nof Yûssuf Bey, I had bestowed no more than a glance upon the envelope\r\nwherein, early on the morning of the same day, I had lovingly sealed\r\nthe authentic veil; and a full hour had elapsed between the time of\r\nparting with the sugar-lipped one and my return to my rooms at the\r\nhotel.\r\n\r\nI understood, now, why the lock of my attaché-case had been out of\r\norder on that occasion ... and I comprehended the sweet smile of Abû\r\nTabâh!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH-RING OF SNEFERU\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe orchestra had just ceased playing; and, taking advantage of the\r\nlull in the music, my companion leaned confidentially forward,\r\nshooting suspicious glances all around him, although there was nothing\r\nabout the well-dressed after-dinner throng filling Shepheard's that\r\nnight to have aroused misgiving in the mind of a cinema anarchist.\r\n\r\n\"I have a very big thing in view,\" he said, speaking in a husky\r\nwhisper. \"I shall be one up on you, Kernaby, if I pull it off.\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced sideways, in the manner of a pantomime brigand, at a party\r\nof New York tourists, our immediate neighbors, and from them to an\r\nelderly peer with whom I was slightly acquainted and who, in addition\r\nto his being stone deaf, had never noticed anything in his life, much\r\nless attempted so fatiguing an operation as intrigue.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" I commented; and rang the bell with the purpose in view of\r\nordering another cooling beverage.\r\n\r\nTrue, I might be the Egyptian representative of a Birmingham\r\ncommercial enterprise, but I did not gladly suffer the society of\r\nthis individual, whose only claim to my acquaintance lay in the fact\r\nthat he was in the employ of a rival house. My lack of interest\r\npalpably disappointed him; but I thought little of the man's qualities\r\nas a connoisseur and less of his company. His name was Theo Bishop and\r\nI fancy that his family was associated with the tanning industry.\r\nI have since thought more kindly of poor Bishop, but at the time of\r\nwhich I write nothing could have pleased me better than his sudden\r\ndissolution.\r\n\r\nPerhaps unconsciously I had allowed my boredom to become rudely\r\napparent; for Bishop slightly turned his head aside, and--\r\n\r\n\"Right-o, Kernaby,\" he said; \"I know you think I am an ass, so we\r\nwill say no more about it. Another cocktail?\"\r\n\r\nAnd now I became conscience-stricken; for mingled with the\r\ndisappointment in Bishop's tone and manner was another note. Vaguely\r\nit occurred to me that the man was yearning for sympathy of some kind,\r\nthat he was bursting to unbosom himself, and that the vanity of a\r\nsuccessful rival was by no means wholly responsible. I have since\r\nplaced that ambiguous note and recognized it for a note of tragedy.\r\nBut at the time I was deaf to its pleading.\r\n\r\nWe chatted then for some while longer on indifferent topics, Bishop\r\nbeing, as I have indicated, a man difficult to offend; when, having\r\ncorrespondence to deal with, I retired to my own room. I suppose I\r\nhad been writing for about an hour, when a servant came to announce\r\na caller. Taking an ordinary visiting-card from the brass salver,\r\nI read--\r\n\r\n     ABÛ TABÂH.\r\n\r\nNo title preceded the name, no address followed, but I became aware of\r\nsomething very like a nervous thrill as I stared at the name of my\r\nvisitor. Personality is one of the profoundest mysteries of our being.\r\nOf the person whose card I held in my hand I knew little, practically\r\nnothing; his actions, if at times irregular, had never been wantonly\r\nviolent; his manner was gentle as that of a mother to a baby and his\r\nsingular reputation among the natives I thought I could afford to\r\nignore; for the Egyptian, like the Celt, with all his natural\r\nendowments, is yet a child at heart. Therefore I cannot explain why,\r\nsitting there in my room in Shepheard's Hotel, I knew and recognized,\r\nat the name of Abû Tabâh, the touch of fear.\r\n\r\n\"I will see him downstairs,\" I said.\r\n\r\nThen, as the servant was about to depart, recognizing that I had made\r\na concession to that strange sentiment which the Imám Abû Tabâh had\r\nsomehow inspired in me--\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I added; \"show him up here to my room.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments later the man returned again, carrying the brass salver,\r\nupon which lay a sealed envelope. I took it up in surprise, noting\r\nthat it was one belonging to the hotel, and, ere opening it--\r\n\r\n\"Where is my visitor?\" I said in Arabic.\r\n\r\n\"He regrets that he cannot stay,\" replied the man; \"but he sends you\r\nthis letter.\"\r\n\r\nGreatly mystified, I dismissed the servant and tore open the envelope.\r\nInside, upon a sheet of hotel notepaper I found this remarkable\r\nmessage--\r\n\r\n  KERNABY PASHA--\r\n\r\n  There are reasons why I cannot stay to see you personally, but I\r\n  would have you believe that this warning is dictated by nothing\r\n  but friendship. Grave peril threatens. It is associated with the\r\n  hieroglyphic--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  If you would avert it, and if you value your life, avoid all contact\r\n  with anything bearing this figure.\r\n\r\n     ABÛ TABÂH.\r\n\r\nThe mystery deepened. There had been something incongruous about the\r\nmodern European visiting-card used by this representative of Islam,\r\nthis living illustration of the _Arabian Nights_; now, his\r\nincomprehensible \"warning\" plunged me back again into the mediæval\r\nOrient to which he properly belonged. Yet I knew Abû Tabâh, for all\r\nhis romantic aspect, to be eminently practical, and I could not credit\r\nhim with descending to the methods of melodrama.\r\n\r\nAs I studied the precise wording of the note, I seemed to see the slim\r\nfigure of its author before me, black-robed, white-turbaned, and\r\nurbane, his delicate ivory hands crossed and resting upon the head of\r\nthe ebony cane without which I had never seen him. Almost, I succumbed\r\nto a sort of subjective hallucination; Abû Tabâh became a veritable\r\npresence, and the poetic beauty of his face struck me anew, as, fixing\r\nupon me his eyes, which were like the eyes of a gazelle, he spoke the\r\nstrange words cited above, in the pure and polished English which he\r\nheld at command, and described in the air, with a long nervous\r\nforefinger, the queer device which symbolized the Ancient Egyptian\r\ngod, Set, the Destroyer.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was the aura of a powerful personality, clinging even to\r\nthe written message; but there was something about the impression made\r\nupon me which argued for the writer's sincerity.\r\n\r\nThat Abû Tabâh was some kind of agent, recognized--at any rate\r\nunofficially--by the authorities, I knew or shrewdly surmised; but the\r\nexact nature of his activities, and how he reconciled them with his\r\nreligious duties, remained profoundly mysterious. The episode had\r\nrendered further work impossible, and I descended to the terrace, with\r\nno more definite object in view than that of finding a quiet corner\r\nwhere I might meditate in the congenial society of my briar, and at\r\nthe same time seek inspiration from the ever-changing throng in the\r\nShâria Kâmel Pasha.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely set my foot upon the terrace, however, ere a hand was\r\nlaid upon my arm. Turning quickly I recognized, in the dusk, Hassan\r\nes-Sugra, for many years a trusted employee of the British\r\nArchæological Society.\r\n\r\nHis demeanor was at once excited and furtive, and I recognized with\r\nsomething akin to amazement that he, also, had a story to unfold. I\r\nmentally catalogued this eventful evening \"the night of strange\r\nconfidences.\"\r\n\r\nSeated at a little table on the deserted balcony (for the evening was\r\nvery chilly) and directly facing the shop of Philip, the dealer in\r\nArab woodwork, Hassan es-Sugra told his wonder tale; and as he told it\r\nI knew that Fate had cast me, willy-nilly, for a part in some comedy\r\nupon which the curtain had already risen here in Cairo, and whereof\r\nthe second act should be played in perhaps the most ancient setting\r\nwhich the hand of man has builded. As the narrative unrolled itself\r\nbefore me, I perceived wheels within wheels; I was wholly absorbed,\r\nyet half incredulous.\r\n\r\n\"... When the professor abandoned work on the pyramid, Kernaby Pasha,\"\r\nhe said, bending eagerly forward and laying his muscular brown hand\r\nupon my sleeve, \"it was not because there was no more to learn\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am aware of this, O Hassan,\" I interrupted, \"it was in order that\r\nthey might carry on the work at the Pyramid of Illahûn, which resulted\r\nin a find of jewelery almost unique in the annals of Egyptology.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I not know all this!\" exclaimed Hassan impatiently; \"and was not\r\nmine the hand that uncovered the golden uræus? But the work projected\r\nat the Pyramid of Méydûm was never completed, and I can tell you why.\"\r\n\r\nI stared at him through the gloom; for I had already some idea\r\nrespecting the truth of this matter.\r\n\r\n\"It was that the men, over two hundred of them, refused to enter the\r\npassage again,\" he whispered dramatically, \"it was because misfortune\r\nand disaster visited more than one who had penetrated to a certain\r\nplace therein.\" He bent further forward. \"The Pyramid of Méydûm is the\r\nhome of a powerful _Efreet_, Kernaby Pasha! But I who was the last to\r\nleave it, know what is concealed there. In a certain place, low down\r\nin the corner of the King's Chamber, is a ring of gold, bearing a\r\ncartouche. It is the royal ring of the Pharaoh who built the pyramid.\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased, watching me intently. I did not doubt Hassan's word, for I\r\nhad always counted him a man of integrity; but there was much that was\r\nobscure and much that was mysterious in his story.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not bring it away?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I feared to touch it, Kernaby Pasha; it is an evil talisman. Until\r\nto-day I have feared to speak of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to-day!\"\r\n\r\nHassan extended his hands, palms upward.\r\n\r\n\"I am threatened with the loss of my house,\" he said simply, \"if I do\r\nnot find a certain sum of money within a period of twelve days.\"\r\n\r\nI sat resting my chin on my hand and staring into the face of Hassan\r\nes-Sugra. Could it be that from superstitious motives such a treasure\r\nhad indeed been abandoned? Could it be that Fate had delivered into\r\nmy hands a relic so priceless as the signet-ring of Sneferu, one of\r\nthe earliest Memphite Pharaohs? Since I had recently incurred the\r\ndispleasure of my principals, Messrs. Moses, Murphy & Co., of\r\nBirmingham, the mere anticipation of such a \"find\" was sufficient to\r\nraise my professional enthusiasm to white heat, and in those few\r\nmoments of silence I had decided upon instant action.\r\n\r\n\"Meet me at Rikka Station, to-morrow morning at nine o'clock,\" I said,\r\n\"and arrange for donkeys to carry us to the pyramid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Rikka, and therefore at the very outset of my\r\ninquiry, I met with what one slightly prone to superstition might\r\nhave regarded as an unfortunate omen. A native funeral was passing\r\nout of the town amid the wailing of women and the chanting by the\r\n_Yemeneeyeh_, of the Profession of the Faith, with its queer\r\nmonotonous cadences, a performance which despite its familiarity in\r\nthe Near East never failed to affect me unpleasantly. By the token of\r\nthe _tarbûsh_ upon the bier, I knew that this was a man who was being\r\nhurried to his lonely resting-place on the fringe of the desert.\r\n\r\nAs the procession wound its way out across the sands, I saw to the\r\nremoval of my baggage and joined Hassan es-Sugra, who awaited me by\r\nthe wooden barrier. I perceived immediately that something was wrong\r\nwith the man; he was palpably laboring under the influence of some\r\nstrong excitement, and his dark eyes regarded me almost fearfully.\r\nHe was muttering to himself like one suffering from an over-indulgence\r\nin _Hashish_, and I detected the words \"_Allahu akbar!_\" (God is most\r\ngreat) several times repeated.\r\n\r\n\"What ails you, Hassan, my friend?\" I said; and noting how his gaze\r\npersistently returned to the melancholy procession wending its way\r\ntowards the little Moslem cemetery:--\"Was the dead man some relation\r\nof yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Kernaby Pasha,\" he muttered gutturally, and moistened his\r\nlips with his tongue; \"I was but slightly acquainted with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet you are much disturbed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Kernaby Pasha,\" he assured me; \"not in the slightest.\"\r\n\r\nBy which familiar formula I knew that Hassan es-Sugra would conceal\r\nfrom me the cause of his distress, and therefore, since I had no\r\nappetite for further mysteries, I determined to learn it from another\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n\"See to the loading of the donkey,\" I directed him--for three sleek\r\nlittle animals were standing beside him, patiently awaiting the toil\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nHassan setting about the task with a cheerful alacrity obviously\r\nartificial, I approached the native station master, with whom I was\r\nacquainted, and put to him a number of questions respecting his\r\nimportant functions--in which I was not even mildly interested. But to\r\nthe Oriental mind a direct inquiry is an affront, almost an insult;\r\nand to have inquired bluntly the name of the deceased and the manner\r\nof his death would have been the best way to have learned nothing\r\nwhatever about the matter. Therefore having discussed in detail the\r\nslothful incompetence of Arab ticket collectors and the lazy condition\r\nand innate viciousness of Egyptian porters as a class, I mentioned\r\nincidentally that I had observed a funeral leaving Rikka.\r\n\r\nThe station master (who was bursting to talk about this very matter,\r\nbut who would have declined on principle to do so had I definitely\r\nquestioned him) now unfolded to me the strange particulars respecting\r\nthe death of one, Ahmed Abdulla, who had been a retired dragoman\r\nthough some time employed as an excavator.\r\n\r\n\"He rode out one night upon his white donkey,\" said my informant, \"and\r\nno man knows whither he went. But it is believed, Kernaby Pasha, that\r\nit was to the Haram el-Kaddâb\" (the False Pyramid)--extending his hand\r\nto where, beyond the belt of fertility, the tomb of Sneferu up-reared\r\nits three platforms from the fringe of the desert. \"To enter the\r\npyramid even in day time is to court misfortune; to enter at night is\r\nto fall into the hands of the powerful _Efreet_ who dwells there. His\r\ndonkey returned without him, and therefore search was made for Ahmed\r\nAbdulla. He was found the next day\"--again the long arm shot out\r\ntowards the desert--\"dead upon the sands, near the foot of the\r\npyramid.\"\r\n\r\nI looked into the face of the speaker; beyond doubt he was in deadly\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\n\"Why should Ahmed Abdulla have wanted to visit such a place at night?\"\r\nI asked.\r\n\r\nMy acquaintance lowered his voice, muttered \"_Sahâm Allah fee 'adoo\r\ned--dîn!_\" (May God transfix the enemies of the religion) and touched\r\nhis forehead, his mouth, and his breast with the iron ring which he\r\nwore.\r\n\r\n\"There is a great treasure concealed there, Kernaby Pasha,\" he\r\nreplied; \"a treasure hidden from the world in the days of Suleyman\r\nthe Great, sealed with his seal, and guarded by the servants of Gánn\r\nIbn-Gánn.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you think the guardian _ginn_ killed Ahmed Abdulla?\"\r\n\r\nThe station master muttered invocations, and--\r\n\r\n\"There are things which may not be spoken of,\" he said; \"but those who\r\nsaw him dead say that he was terrible to look upon. A great _Welee_, a\r\nman of wisdom famed throughout Egypt, has been summoned to avert the\r\nevil; for if the anger of the _ginn_ is aroused they may visit the\r\nmost painful and unfortunate penalties upon all Rikka....\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later I set out, having confidentially informed the\r\nstation master that I sought to obtain a fine turquoise necklet which\r\nI knew to be in the possession of the Sheikh of Méydûm. Little did I\r\nsuspect how it was written that I should indeed visit the house of the\r\nvenerable Sheikh. Out through the fields of young green corn, the palm\r\ngroves and the sycamore orchards I rode, Hassan plodding silently\r\nbehind me and leading the donkey who bore the baggage. Curious eyes\r\nwatched our passage, from field, doorway, and _shadûf_; but nothing of\r\nnote marked our journey save the tremendous heat of the sun at noon,\r\nbeneath which I knew myself a fool to travel.\r\n\r\nI camped on the western side of the pyramid, but well clear of the\r\nmarshes, which are the home of countless wild-fowl. I had no idea how\r\nlong it would take me to extract the coveted ring from its\r\nhiding-place (which Hassan had closely described to me); and,\r\nremembering the speculative glances of the villagers, I had no\r\nintention of exposing myself against the face of the pyramid until\r\ndusk should have come to cloak my operations.\r\n\r\nHassan es-Sugra, whose new taciturnity was remarkable and whose\r\nbehavior was distinguished by an odd disquiet, set out with his gun to\r\nprocure our dinner, and I mounted the sandy slope on the southwest of\r\nthe pyramid, where from my cover behind a mound of rubbish, I studied\r\nthrough my field-glasses the belt of vegetation marking the course of\r\nthe Nile. I could detect no sign of surveillance, but in view of the\r\nfact that the smuggling of relics out of Egypt is a punishable offence\r\nmy caution was dictated by wisdom.\r\n\r\nWe dined excellently, Hassan the Silent and I, upon quail, tinned\r\ntomatoes, fresh dates, bread, and Vichy-water (to which in my own case\r\nwas added a stiff three fingers of whisky).\r\n\r\nWhen the newly risen moon cast an ebon shadow of the Pyramid of\r\nSneferu upon the carpet of the sands, I made my way around the angle\r\nof the ancient building towards the mound on the northern side whereby\r\none approaches the entrance. Three paces from the shadow's edge, I\r\npaused, transfixed, because of that which confronted me.\r\n\r\nOutlined against the moon-bright sky upon a ridge of the desert behind\r\nand to the north of the great structure, stood the motionless figure\r\nof a man!\r\n\r\nFor a moment I thought that my mind had conjured up this phantasmal\r\nwatcher, that he was a thing of moon-magic and not of flesh and blood.\r\nBut as I stood regarding him, he moved, seemed to raise his head, then\r\nturned and disappeared beyond the crest.\r\n\r\nHow long I remained staring at the spot where he had been I know not;\r\nbut I was aroused from my useless contemplation by the jingling of\r\ncamel bells. The sound came from behind me, stealing sweetly through\r\nthe stillness from a great distance. I turned in a flash, whipped out\r\nmy glasses and searched the remote fringe of the Fáyûm. Stately\r\nacross the jeweled curtain of the night moved a caravan, blackly\r\nmarked against that wondrous background. Three walking figures I\r\ncounted, three laden donkeys, and two camels. Upon the first of the\r\ncamels a man was mounted, upon the second was a _shibreeyeh_, a sort\r\nof covered litter, which I knew must conceal a woman. The caravan\r\npassed out of sight into the palm grove which conceals the village of\r\nMéydûm.\r\n\r\nI returned my glasses to their case, and stood for some moments deep\r\nin reflection; then I descended the slope, to the tiny encampment\r\nwhere I had left Hassan es-Sugra. He was nowhere to be seen; and\r\nhaving waited some ten minutes I grew impatient, and raising my voice:\r\n\r\n\"Hassan!\" I cried; \"Hassan es-Sugra!\"\r\n\r\nNo answer greeted me, although in the desert stillness the call must\r\nhave been audible for miles. A second and a third time I called his\r\nname ... and the only reply was the shrill note of a pyramid bat that\r\nswooped low above my head; the vast solitude of the sands swallowed up\r\nmy voice and the walls of the Tomb of Sneferu mocked me with their\r\necho, crying eerily:\r\n\r\n\"Hassan! Hassan es-Sugra.... Hassan!...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThis mysterious episode affected me unpleasantly, but did not divert\r\nme from my purpose: I succeeded in casting out certain demons of\r\nsuperstition who had sought to lay hold upon me; and a prolonged\r\nscrutiny of the surrounding desert somewhat allayed my fears of human\r\nsurveillance. For my visit to the chamber in the heart of the ancient\r\nbuilding I had arrayed myself in rubber-soled shoes, an old pair of\r\ndrill trousers, and a pyjama jacket. A Colt repeater was in my hip\r\npocket, and, in addition to several instruments which I thought might\r\nbe useful in extracting the ring from its setting, I carried a\r\npowerful electric torch.\r\n\r\nSeated on the threshold of the entrance, fifty feet above the desert\r\nlevel, I cast a final glance backward towards the Nile valley, then,\r\nthe lighted torch carried in my jacket pocket, I commenced the descent\r\nof the narrow, sloping passage. Periodically, when some cranny between\r\nthe blocks offered a foothold, I checked my progress, and inspected\r\nthe steep path below for snake tracks.\r\n\r\nSome two hundred and forty feet of labored, descent discovered me in\r\na sort of shallow cavern little more than a yard high and partly hewn\r\nout of the living rock which formed the foundation of the pyramid.\r\nIn this place I found the heat to be almost insufferable, and the smell\r\nof remote mortality which assailed my nostrils from the sand-strewn\r\nfloor threatened to choke me. For five minutes or more I lay there,\r\nbathed in perspiration, my nerves at high tension, listening for the\r\nslightest sound within or without. I cannot pretend that I was\r\nentirely master of myself. The stuff that fear is made of seemed to\r\nrise from the ancient dust; and I had little relish for the second\r\npart of my journey, which lay through a long horizontal passage rarely\r\nexceeding fourteen inches in height. The mere memory of that final\r\ncrawl of forty feet or so is sufficient to cause me to perspire\r\nprofusely; therefore let it suffice that I reached the end of the\r\nsecond passage, and breathing with difficulty the deathful, poisonous\r\natmosphere of the place, found myself at the foot of the rugged shaft\r\nwhich gives access to the King's Chamber. Resting my torch upon a\r\nconvenient ledge, I climbed up, and knew myself to be in one of the\r\noldest chambers fashioned by human handiwork.\r\n\r\nThe journey had been most exhausting, but, allowing myself only a few\r\nmoments' rest, I crossed to the eastern corner of the place and\r\ndirected a ray of light upon the crevice which, from Hassan's\r\ndescription, I believed to conceal the ring. His account having been\r\ndetailed, I experienced little difficulty in finding the cavity; but\r\nin the very moment of success the light of the torch grew dim ... and\r\nI recognized with a mingling of chagrin and fear that it was burnt out\r\nand that I had no means of recharging it.\r\n\r\nEre the light expired, I had time to realize two things: that the\r\ncavity was empty ... and that someone or something was approaching the\r\nfoot of the shaft along the horizontal passage below!\r\n\r\nStrictly though I have schooled my emotions, my heart was beating in\r\na most uncomfortable fashion, as, crouching near the edge of the shaft,\r\nI watched the red glow fade from the delicate filament of the lamp.\r\nRetreat was impossible; there is but one entrance to the pyramid; and\r\nthe darkness which now descended upon me was indescribable; it\r\npossessed horrific qualities; it seemed palpably to enfold me like the\r\nwings of some monstrous bat. The air of the King's Chamber I found to\r\nbe almost unbearable, and it was no steady hand with which I gripped\r\nmy pistol.\r\n\r\nThe sounds of approach continued. The suspense was becoming\r\nintolerable--when, into the Memphian gloom below me, there suddenly\r\nintruded a faint but ever-growing light. Between excitement and\r\ninsufficient air, I regarded suffocation as imminent. Then, out into\r\nview beneath me, was thrust a slim ivory hand which held an electric\r\npocket lamp. Fascinatedly I watched it, saw it joined by its fellow,\r\nthen observed a white-turbaned head and a pair of black-robed\r\nshoulders follow. In my surprise I almost dropped the weapon which\r\nI held. The new arrival now standing upright and raising his head,\r\nI found myself looking into the face of _Abû Tabâh_!\r\n\r\n\"To Allah, the Great, the Compassionate, be all praise that I have\r\nfound you alive,\" he said simply.\r\n\r\nHe exhibited little evidence of the journey which I had found so\r\nfatiguing, but an expression strongly like that of real anxiety rested\r\nupon his ascetic face.\r\n\r\n\"If life is dear to you,\" he continued, \"answer me this, Kernaby\r\nPasha; have you found the ring?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not,\" I replied; \"my lamp failed me; but I think the ring is\r\ngone.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, as I spoke the words, the strangeness of his question came\r\nhome to me, bringing with it an acute suspicion.\r\n\r\n\"What do you know of this ring, O my friend?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"I know much that is evil,\" he replied; \"and because you doubt the\r\npurity of my motives, all that I have learned you shall learn also;\r\nfor Allah the Great, the Merciful, this night has protected you from\r\ndanger and spared you a frightful death. Follow me, Kernaby Pasha,\r\nin order that these things may be made manifest to you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nA pair of fleet camels were kneeling at the foot of the slope below\r\nthe entrance to the pyramid, and having recovered somewhat from the\r\neffect of the fatiguing climb out from the King's Chamber--\r\n\r\n\"It might be desirable,\" I said, \"that I adopt a more suitable raiment\r\nfor camel riding?\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh slowly shook his head in that dignified manner which never\r\ndeserted him. He had again taken up his ebony walking-stick and was\r\nnow resting his crossed hands upon it and regarding me with his\r\nstrange, melancholy eyes.\r\n\r\n\"To delay would be unwise,\" he replied. \"You have mercifully been\r\nspared a painful and unfortunate end (all praise to Him who averted\r\nthe peril); but the ring, which bears an ancient curse, is gone: for\r\nme there is no rest until I have found and destroyed it.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a solemn conviction which bore the seal of verity.\r\n\r\n\"Your destructive theory may be perfectly sound,\" I said; \"but as one\r\nprofessionally interested in relics of the past, I feel called upon to\r\nprotest. Perhaps before we proceed any further you will enlighten me\r\nrespecting this most obscure matter. Can you inform me, for example,\r\nwhat became of Hassan es-Sugra?\"\r\n\r\n\"He observed my approach from a distance, and fled, being a man of\r\nlittle virtue. Respecting the other matters you shall be fully\r\nenlightened, to-night. The white camel is for you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a gentle finality in his manner to which I succumbed. My\r\nfeelings towards this mysterious being had undergone a slight change;\r\nand whilst I cannot truthfully say that I loved him as a brother,\r\na certain respect for Abû Tabâh was taking possession of my mind. I\r\nbegan to understand his reputation with the natives; beyond doubt his\r\nuncanny wisdom was impressive; his lofty dignity awed. And no man is\r\nat his best arrayed in canvas shoes, very dirty drill trousers, and\r\na pyjama jacket.\r\n\r\nAs I had anticipated, the village of Méydûm proved to be our\r\ndestination, and the gait of the magnificent creatures upon which we\r\nwere mounted was exhausting. I shall always remember that moonlight\r\nride across the desert to the palm groves of Méydûm. I entered the\r\nhouse of the Sheikh with misgivings; for my attire fell short of the\r\nideal to which every representative of protective Britain looks up,\r\nbut often fails to realize.\r\n\r\nIn a _mandarah_, part of it inlaid with fine mosaic and boasting a\r\npretty fountain, I was presented to the imposing old man who was\r\nevidently the host of Abû Tabâh. Ere taking my seat upon the _dîwan_,\r\nI shed my canvas shoes, in accordance with custom, accepted a pipe and\r\na cup of excellent coffee, and awaited with much curiosity the next\r\ndevelopment. A brief colloquy between Abû Tabâh and the Sheikh, at the\r\nfurther end of the apartment resulted in the disappearance of the\r\nSheikh and the approach of my mysterious friend.\r\n\r\n\"Because, although you are not a Moslem, you are a man of culture and\r\nunderstanding,\" said Abû Tabâh, \"I have ordered that my sister shall\r\nbe brought into your presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is exceedingly good of you,\" I said, but indeed I knew it to be\r\nan honor which spoke volumes at once for Abû Tabâh's enlightenment and\r\ngood opinion of myself.\r\n\r\n\"She is a virgin of great beauty,\" he continued; \"and the excellence\r\nof her mind exceeds the perfection of her person.\"\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you,\" I answered politely, \"upon the possession of a\r\nsister in every way so desirable.\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh inclined his head in a characteristic gesture of gentle\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\n\"Allah has indeed blessed my house,\" he admitted; \"and because your\r\nmind is filled with conjectures respecting the source of certain\r\ninformation which you know me to possess, I desire that the matter\r\nshall be made clear to you.\"\r\n\r\nHow I should have answered this singular man I know not; but as he\r\nspoke the words, into the _mandarah_ came the Sheikh, followed by a\r\ngirl robed and veiled entirely in white. With gait slow and graceful\r\nshe approached the _dîwan_. She wore a white _yelek_ so closely\r\nwrapped about her that it concealed the rest of her attire, and a\r\nwhite _tarbar_, or head-veil, decorated with gold embroidery, almost\r\nentirely concealed her hair, save for one jet-black plait in which\r\nlittle gold ornaments were entwined and which hung down on the left of\r\nher forehead. A white _yashmak_ reached nearly to her feet, which were\r\nclad in little red leather slippers.\r\n\r\nAs she approached me I was impressed, not so much with the details of\r\nher white attire, nor with the fine lines of a graceful figure which\r\nthe gossamer robe quite failed to conceal, but with her wonderful\r\ngazelle-like eyes, which wore uncannily like those of her brother,\r\nsave that their bordering of _kohl_ lent them an appearance of being\r\nlarger and more luminous.\r\n\r\nNo form of introduction was observed; with modestly lowered eyes the\r\ngirl saluted me and took her seat upon a heap of cushions before a\r\nsmall coffee table set at one end of the _dîwan_. The Sheikh, seated\r\nhimself beside me, and Abû Tabâh, with a reed pen, wrote something\r\nrapidly on a narrow strip of paper. The Sheikh clapped his hands, a\r\nman entered bearing a brazier containing live charcoal, and, having\r\nplaced it upon the floor, immediately withdrew. The _dîwan_ was\r\nlighted by a lantern swung from the ceiling, and its light, pouring\r\nfully down upon the white figure of the girl, and leaving the other\r\npersons and objects in comparative shadow, produced a picture which\r\nI am unlikely to forget.\r\n\r\nAmid a tense silence, Abû Tabâh took from a box upon the table some\r\nresinous substance. This he sprinkled upon the fire in the brazier;\r\nand the girl extending a small hand and round soft arm across the\r\ntable, he again dipped his pen in the ink and drew upon the upturned\r\npalm a rough square which he divided into nine parts, writing in each\r\nan Arabic figure. Finally, in the centre he poured a small drop of\r\nink, upon which, in response to words rapidly spoken, the girl fixed\r\nan intent gaze.\r\n\r\nInto the brazier Abû Tabâh dropped one by one fragments of the paper\r\nupon which he had written what I presumed to be a form of invocation.\r\nImmediately, standing between the smoking brazier and the girl, he\r\ncommenced a subdued muttering. I recognized that I was about to be\r\ntreated to an exhibition of _darb el-mendel_, Abû Tabâh being\r\nevidently a _sahhar_, or adept in the art called _er-roohânee_. Save\r\nfor this indistinct muttering, no other sound disturbed the silence of\r\nthe apartment, until suddenly the girl began to speak Arabic and in a\r\nsweet but monotonous voice.\r\n\r\n\"Again I see the ring,\" she said, \"a hand is holding it before me.\r\nThe ring bears a green scarab, upon which is written the name of a\r\nking of Egypt.... The ring is gone. I can see it no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seek it,\" directed Abû Tabâh in a low voice, and threw more incense\r\nupon the fire. \"Are you seeking it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the girl, who now began to tremble violently, \"I am in\r\na low passage which slopes downwards so steeply that I am afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear nothing,\" said Abû Tabâh; \"follow the passage.\"\r\n\r\nWith marvelous fidelity the girl described the passage and the shaft\r\nleading to the King's Chamber in the Pyramid of Méydûm. She described\r\nthe cavity in the wall where once (if Hassan es-Sugra was worthy of\r\ncredence) the ring had been concealed.\r\n\r\n\"There is a freshly made hole in the stonework,\" she said. \"The\r\npicture has gone; I am standing in some dark place and the same hand\r\nagain holds the ring before me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it the hand of an Oriental,\" asked Abû Tabâh, \"or of a European?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the hand of a European. It has disappeared; I see a funeral\r\nprocession winding out from Rikka into the desert.\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow the ring,\" directed Abû Tabâh, a queer, compelling note in his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nAgain he sprinkled perfume upon the fire and--\r\n\r\n\"I see a Pharaoh upon his throne,\" continued the monotonous voice,\r\n\"upon the first finger of his left hand he wears the ring with the\r\ngreen scarab. A prisoner stands before him in chains; a woman pleads\r\nwith the king, but he is deaf to her. He draws the ring from his\r\nfinger and hands it to one standing behind the throne--one who has a\r\nvery evil face. Ah!...\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's voice died away in a low wail of fear or horror. But--\r\n\r\n\"What do you see?\" demanded Abû Tabâh.\r\n\r\n\"The death-ring of Pharaoh!\" whispered the soft voice tremulously; \"it\r\nis the death-ring!\"\r\n\r\n\"Return from the past to the present,\" ordered Abû Tabâh. \"Where is\r\nthe ring now?\"\r\n\r\nHe continued his weird muttering, whilst the girl, who still shuddered\r\nviolently, peered again into the pool of ink. Suddenly--\r\n\r\n\"I see a long line of dead men,\" she whispered, speaking in a kind of\r\nchant; \"they are of all the races of the East, and some are swathed in\r\nmummy wrappings; the wrappings are sealed with the death-ring of\r\nPharaoh. They are passing me slowly, on their way across the desert\r\nfrom the Pyramid of Méydûm to a narrow ravine where a tent is erected.\r\nThey go to summon one who is about to join their company....\"\r\n\r\nI suppose the suffocating perfume of the burning incense was chiefly\r\nresponsible, but at this point I realized that I was becoming dizzy\r\nand that immediate departure into a cooler atmosphere was imperative.\r\nQuietly, in order to avoid disturbing the séance, I left the\r\n_mandarah_. So absorbed were the three in their weird performance that\r\nmy departure was apparently unnoticed. Out in the coolness of the palm\r\ngrove I soon recovered. I doubt if I possess the temperament which\r\nenables one to contemplate with equanimity a number of dead men\r\npromenading in their shrouds.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\"The truth is now wholly made manifest,\" said Abû Tabâh; \"the\r\nrevelation is complete.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more I was mounted upon the white camel and the mysterious _imám_\r\nrode beside me upon its fellow, which was of less remarkable color.\r\n\r\n\"I hear your words,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"The poor Ahmed Abdulla,\" he continued, \"who was of little wisdom,\r\nknew, as Hassan es-Sugra knew, of the hidden ring; for he was one of\r\nthose who fled from the pyramid refusing to enter it again. Greed\r\nspoke to him, however, and he revealed the secret to a certain\r\nEnglishman, called Bishop, contracting to aid him in recovering the\r\nring.\"\r\n\r\nAt last enlightenment was mine ... and it brought in its train a\r\ndreadful premonition.\r\n\r\n\"Something I knew of the peril,\" said Abû Tabâh, \"but not, at first,\r\nall. The Englishman I warned, but he neglected my warning. Already\r\nAhmed Abdulla was dead, having been despatched by his employer to the\r\npyramid; and the people of Rikka had sent for me. Now, by means known\r\nto you, I learned that evil powers threatened your life also, in what\r\nform I knew not at that time save that the sign of Set had been\r\nrevealed to me in conjunction with your death.\"\r\n\r\nI shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"That the secret of the pyramid was a Pharaoh's ring I did not learn\r\nuntil later; but now it is made manifest that the thing of power is\r\nthe death-ring of Sneferu....\"\r\n\r\nThe huge bulk of the Pyramid of Méydûm loomed above us as he spoke the\r\nwords, for we were nearly come to our destination; and its proximity\r\noccasioned within me a physical chill. I do not think an open check\r\nfor a thousand pounds would have tempted me to enter the place again.\r\nThe death-ring of Sneferu possessed uncomfortable and supernatural\r\nproperties. So far as I was aware, no example of such a ring (the\r\n_lettre de cachet_ of the period) was included in any known collection.\r\nOne dating much after Sneferu, and bearing the cartouche of Apepi II\r\n(one of the Hyksos, or Shepherd Kings) came to light late in the\r\nnineteenth century; it was reported to be the ring which, traditionally,\r\nJoseph wore as emblematical of the power vested in him by Pharaoh.\r\nSir Gaston Maspero and other authorities considered it to be a forgery\r\nand it vanished from the ken of connoisseurs. I never learned by what\r\nfirm it was manufactured.\r\n\r\nA mile to the west of the pyramid we found Theo Bishop's encampment.\r\nI thought it to be deserted--until I entered the little tent....\r\n\r\nAn oil-lamp stood upon a wooden box; and its rays made yellow the face\r\nof the man stretched upon the camp-bed. My premonition was realized;\r\nBishop must have entered the pyramid less than an hour ahead of me;\r\nhe it was who had stood upon the mound, silhouetted against the sky,\r\nwhen I had first approached the slope. He had met with the fate of\r\nAhmed Abdulla.\r\n\r\nHe had been dead for at least two hours, and by the token of certain\r\nhideous glandular swellings, I knew that he had met his end by the\r\nbite of an Egyptian viper.\r\n\r\n\"Abû Tabâh!\" I cried, my voice hoarsely unnatural--\"the _recess_ in\r\nthe King's Chamber is a viper's nest!\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak wisdom, Kernaby Pasha; the viper is the servant of the\r\n_ginn_.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the third finger of his swollen right hand Bishop wore the ring\r\nof ghastly history; and the mysterious significance of the Sign of Set\r\nbecame apparent. For added to the usual cartouche of the Pharaoh was\r\nthe symbol of the god of destruction, thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe buried him deeply, piling stones upon the grave, that the jackals\r\nof the desert might never disturb the last holder of the death-ring of\r\nSneferu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE LADY OF THE LATTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe interior of the room was very dark, but with the aid of the\r\nelectric torch which I carried I was enabled to form a fairly good\r\nimpression of its general character, and having now surveyed the\r\nentire house I had concluded that it might possibly serve my purpose.\r\nThe real ownership of many native houses in Cairo is difficult to\r\nestablish, and the unveracious Egyptian from whom I had procured the\r\nkeys may or may not have been entitled to let the premises. However,\r\nhe had the keys; and that in the Near East is a sufficient evidence of\r\nownership. My viewing the place at night was dictated by motives of\r\nprudence; for I did not propose unduly to impress my personality upon\r\nthe inhabitants of the Darb el-Ahmar.\r\n\r\nCuriosity respecting the outlook at the rear now led me to enter the\r\ndeep recess at one end of the room, which boasted an imperfect but not\r\nunpicturesque _mushrabîyeh_ window. Moonlight slanted down into the\r\nnarrow lane which the window overhung and cast a quaint fretwork\r\nshadow upon the dusty floor at my feet. Idly I opened one of the\r\nlittle square lattices and peered down into the shadowy gully beneath.\r\nThe lane was silent and empty, and I next directed my attention to a\r\nsimilar window which protruded from the adjoining house.\r\n\r\nA panel corresponding to mine stood open also in the neighboring\r\nwindow; and by means of a soft light in the room I detected the head\r\nand shoulders of a woman, who, her arm resting upon the ledge,\r\nsurveyed the vacant night.\r\n\r\nBy reason of her position, whilst her hand and arm lay fully in the\r\nmoonlight, her face and figure were indistinct. I, on the contrary,\r\nwas clearly visible to her, and although I knew that she must have\r\nseen me she made no effort to withdraw. On the contrary, she leaned\r\nartlessly forward as if to gaze upon the stars, permitting me a sight\r\nof her unveiled face and of a portion of her shapely neck.\r\n\r\nHer eyes, as is usual with Egyptian women, were large and fine, and\r\nas is usual with all women, she was aware of the fact, casting glances\r\nupward and to the right and left calculated to exhibit their beauty.\r\n\r\nThe coquetry of her movements was unmistakable; and when, lifting a\r\npretty arm, she brushed aside a lock of hair which overhung her brow\r\nand uttered a tremulous sigh, I perceived that I had found favor in\r\nher sight.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the graceful gesture had inclined my heart towards her;\r\nfor it had served to reveal not only the symmetry of her shape but the\r\npresence upon her arm, immediately above the elbow, of a magnificent\r\nbangle in gold and lapis-lazuli which, if I might trust my judgment,\r\nwas fashioned no later than the XIXth dynasty! Clearly the house next\r\ndoor, and its occupant, were the property of some man of wealth and\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nThere is a maxim in the East--\"Avoid the veil\"; and to this hitherto\r\nI had paid the strictest attention. Soft glances from _harêm_ windows\r\nusually leave me cold. But the presence of an armlet finer than\r\nanything in the Treasure of Zagazig placed a new complexion upon this\r\naffair, and the connoisseur within me took the matter out of my hands.\r\n\r\nAcross the intervening patch of darkness our glances met; the girl's\r\ndark lashes were lowered demurely, then raised again, and the boldness\r\nof my unfaltering gaze was rewarded by a smile. Thus encouraged:--\r\n\r\n\"O daughter of the moon,\" I whispered fancifully in Arabic,\r\n\"condescend to speak to one whom the sight of thy beauty hath\r\nenslaved.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear to be discovered, Inglîsi,\" came the soft reply; \"or willingly\r\nwould I converse with thee, for I am lonely and wretched.\"\r\n\r\nShe sighed again and directed upon me a glance that was less wretched\r\nthan roguish. Evidently the adventure was much to her liking.\r\n\r\n\"Let me solace your loneliness,\" I replied; \"for assuredly we can\r\nconceive some plan of meeting.\"\r\n\r\nShe lowered her eyes at that, and seemed to hesitate; then--\r\n\r\n\"In the roof of your house,\" she whispered, often glancing over her\r\nshoulder into the room beyond, \"is a trap--which is bolted....\"\r\n\r\nFootsteps sounded in the lane beneath--whereat the vision at the\r\nwindow vanished and the lattice was closed; but not before the girl\r\nhad intimated by a gesture that I was to remain.\r\n\r\nDiscreetly withdrawing into my dusty apartment, I endeavored to make\r\nout the form of the intruder who now was passing underneath the\r\nwindow; but the density of the shadows in the lane rendered it\r\nimpossible for me to do so. He seemed to pause for a time and I\r\nimagined that I could see him staring upward; then he passed on and\r\nsilence again claimed that deserted quarter of Cairo.\r\n\r\nFor fully half an hour I waited, and was preparing to depart when a\r\npart of the shadows overlying the projecting window seemed to grow\r\nblacker, and I realized with joy that at last the lattice was\r\nreopening, but that the room within was now in darkness. Whilst I\r\nwatched, remaining scrupulously invisible, a small parcel deftly\r\nthrown dropped upon the floor at my feet--and my neighbor's window was\r\nreclosed.\r\n\r\nClosing my own, I picked up the parcel. It proved to be a small ivory\r\nbox, which at some time had evidently contained _kohl_, wrapped in a\r\npiece of silk and containing a note. Returning to the lower floor I\r\ndirected the light of my electric torch upon this charmingly romantic\r\nbillet. It was conceived in English and characterized by the rather\r\nalarming _naiveté_ of the Oriental woman. I give it in its entirety.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow night, nine o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMy cautious inquiries respecting the house in the Darb el-Ahmar led\r\nonly to the discovery that it belonged to a mysterious personage whose\r\nreal identity was unknown even to his servants; but this did not\r\nparticularly intrigue me; for in the East the maintenance of two\r\nentirely self-contained establishments is not more uncommon than in\r\ncountries less generously provided in the matter of marriage laws.\r\nAfter all the taking of a second wife does not so much depend on a\r\nman's religious convictions as upon his first wife.\r\n\r\nReflecting upon the probable history of the armlet of lapis-lazuli,\r\nI returned to Shepheard's in time to keep my appointment with Joseph\r\nMalaglou--a professed Christian who claimed to be of Greek parentage.\r\nI may explain here that it was necessary to provide for the safe\r\nconduct through the customs and elsewhere of those cases of \"Sheffield\r\ncutlery\" which actually contained the scarabs, necklaces, and other\r\n\"antiques,\" the sale of which formed a part of the business of my\r\nfirm. Joseph Malaglou had hitherto successfully conducted this matter\r\nfor me, receiving the goods and storing them at his own warehouse; but\r\nfor various reasons I had decided in future to lease an establishment\r\nof my own for this purpose.\r\n\r\nHe was waiting in the lounge as I entered, and had he been less useful\r\nto me I think I should have had him thrown out; for if ever a swarthy\r\nvillain stepped forth from the pages of an illustrated \"penny\r\ndreadful,\" that swarthy villain was Joseph Malaglou. He approached me\r\nwith outstretched hand; he was perniciously polite; his ingratiating\r\nsmile fired my soul with a lust of blood. Fortunately, our business\r\nwas brief.\r\n\r\n\"The latest consignment is in the hands of my agent at Alexandria,\"\r\nhe said, \"and if you are still determined that the ten cases shall\r\nbe despatched to you direct, I will instruct him; but you cannot\r\nvery well have them sent _here_.\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged and smiled, glancing all about the lounge.\r\n\r\n\"I have no intention of converting Shepheard's Hotel into a cutlery\r\nwarehouse,\" I replied. \"I will advise you in the morning of the\r\naddress to which the cases should be despatched.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Malaglou was palpably disturbed--a mysterious circumstance,\r\nsince, whilst I had made no mention of reducing his fees, under the\r\nnew arrangement he would be saved trouble and storage.\r\n\r\n\"As delay in these matters is unwise,\" he urged, \"why not have the\r\ngoods despatched immediately, and consigned to you at my address?\"\r\n\r\nThere was reason on the man's side, for I had not yet actually leased\r\nthe house in the Darb el-Ahmar; therefore--\r\n\r\n\"I will sleep on the problem,\" I said, \"and communicate my decision in\r\nthe morning.\"\r\n\r\nI stood on the steps watching him depart, a man palpably disturbed in\r\nmind; indeed his behavior was altogether singular, and could only\r\nportend one thing--knavery. I think it highly probable that the\r\nOttoman Empire had a certain claim upon Joseph Malaglou. He was one of\r\nthose nondescript brutes whose mere existence is a menace to our rule\r\nin the Near East. He openly applauded British methods, and was the\r\nworst possible advertisement for the cause he claimed to have\r\nespoused. Altogether he left me in an uneasy mood; so that shortly\r\nafter the third, or daybreak, call to prayer had sounded from Cairo's\r\nminarets on the morrow, I had arranged to lease the house in the Darb\r\nel-Ahmar for a period of three months, in the name of one Ahmed Ben\r\nTawwab, a mythical friend, and had instructed Joseph Malaglou\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nOther affairs claimed my attention throughout the day; but dusk\r\ndiscovered me at my newly acquired house in the quaint street\r\nadjoining the Bâb ez-Zuwêla. I procured the keys from the venerable\r\nold thief who had leased me the premises and learned from him that a\r\nrepresentative of Joseph Malaglou had been admitted to the house\r\nearlier in the evening, in accordance with my instructions, and had\r\ndelivered a load of boxes there.\r\n\r\nThus, on opening the door, I was not surprised to find the ten cases\r\nfrom Alexandria lying within, neatly labelled:\r\n\r\n  To Ahmed Ben Tawwab,\r\n    Darb el-Ahmar,\r\n      Sukkarîya,\r\n        Cairo.\r\n\r\nAscending to the top floor, I mounted the rickety ladder and unbolted\r\nand opened the trap. A cautious glance to the right revealed the fact\r\nthat little difficulty existed in passing from roof to roof; for in\r\nEgyptian houses these are flat and are used for various domestic\r\npurposes. I consulted my watch: the hour of the tryst was come.\r\n\r\nAnd even as I learned the fact, from my neighbor's roof sounded the\r\nfaint creaking of hinges ... and out into the moonlight stepped an odd\r\nfigure--that of the lady of the lattice, dressed in a \"European\" blue\r\nserge costume which had obviously been purchased, ready made, in the\r\nbazaars! She wore high-heeled French shoes upon her pretty feet and\r\nher picturesque hair was concealed beneath a large Panama hat, from\r\nthe brim of which floated one of those voluminous green veils dear to\r\nthe heart of touring woman and so arranged as to hide her face. Only\r\nthe gleam of her eyes and teeth was visible through the gauze.\r\n\r\nI assisted her to step across, wondering since she was thus attired,\r\nto what crazy expedition I was committed.\r\n\r\n\"Please do not kiss me,\" she whispered, speaking in moderately good\r\nEnglish, \"Fatimah is listening!\"\r\n\r\nSuch ingenuousness was rather alarming.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I replied, \"you have left the trap open.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all right. Fatimah has locked the door of my room and will\r\nadmit no one, because I have a headache and am sleeping!\"\r\n\r\nResting her hand confidingly in mine, she descended the ladder into\r\nthe adjoining house, and, removing the veil from her face, looked up\r\nat me.\r\n\r\n\"You will be kind to me, will you not?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nI suppose a lengthy essay upon the mentality of Oriental womanhood\r\nwould serve no purpose here, therefore I refrain from inserting it.\r\nSeated upon the chests in the room below, Mizmûna--for this was her\r\nname--confided her troubles with perturbing frankness. She had\r\nconceived a characteristically Eastern and sudden infatuation for my\r\nsociety; nor am I prepared to maintain that she would have remained\r\nobdurate to anyone else who had been in a position to unbolt the door\r\nwhich offered the only chance of escape from her prison. The house of\r\nmystery, she informed me, belonged to a person styling himself Yûssuf\r\nof Rosetta (a name that sounded factitious) and she hated him. For two\r\nmonths, I gathered, she had been in Cairo, during which time she had\r\nnever passed beyond the walls of the neighboring courtyard. And the\r\nobject of her nocturnal adventure was innocent enough; she wanted to\r\nsee the European shops and the tourists passing in and out of the big\r\nhotels in the Shâria Kâmel Pasha!\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt was as we passed along the Shâria el-Maghribi, where I had pointed\r\nout the St. James's Restaurant, better known as \"Jimmy's,\" I remember,\r\nthat Mizmûna uttered a little, suppressed cry, and clutched my arm\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she whispered fearfully, \"it is Hanna! and he has seen me!\"\r\n\r\nWith frightened, fascinated eyes she was staring across the street,\r\napparently at a group of curiously muffled natives--and her whole body\r\nwas trembling.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" she said, pulling me urgently, \"take me back! if they find me\r\nthey will kill me!\"\r\n\r\n\"But if they have already seen you----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! take me back,\" she entreated piteously. \"Hanna must not find out\r\nwhere I live.\"\r\n\r\nHere was mystery; but evidently my first dreadful theory that Hanna\r\nwas Mizmûna's husband had been incorrect. Apparently he was not even\r\nacquainted with Yûssuf of Rosetta. But whoever or whatever he might\r\nbe, I silently cursed the lapis armlet which had led me to involve\r\nmyself in his affairs, as I hurried my companion across the Place de\r\nl'Opera and homeward....\r\n\r\nWe were come indeed unmolested but breathless, as near our destination\r\nas that nameless street beside the Mosque of Muayyâd, when Mizmûna\r\nsuddenly stopped, uttered a stifled shriek, and--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, save me!\" she panted, winding her arms about my neck. \"Look!\r\nLook! in the shadow of the mosque door!\"\r\n\r\nPanic threatened me for one fleeting moment; for this part of Cairo is\r\nutterly deserted at night and the mystery of the thing was taking toll\r\nof my nerves; then firmly unclasping the trembling arms, I pushed\r\nMizmûna behind me and snatched out my Colt automatic ... as a group of\r\nmuffled figures became magically detached from the shadows that had\r\nhidden them; and began silently to advance.\r\n\r\nI raised the pistol.\r\n\r\n\"_Usbur!_\" I cried \"_âuz eh?_\" (Stop! what do you want?)\r\n\r\nThey halted at once; but no answering voice broke the uncanny silence\r\nin which they regarded me. Mizmûna plucked at my arm.\r\n\r\n\"Quick! Quick!\" she whispered tremulously, \"the keys! the keys!\"\r\n\r\nI was swift to grasp her meaning.\r\n\r\n\"My right pocket!\" I whispered in answer.\r\n\r\nThe girl's shaking hand groped for the keys, found them; and, uttering\r\nno parting word, Mizmûna darted off along the Sukkarîya, which here\r\nbisects the Darb el-Ahmar. An angry muttering arose from the little\r\nknot of oddly muffled figures, but not one of them had the courage to\r\nattempt a pursuit of the fugitive. Keeping my back to the wall of the\r\nmosque and feeling along it with one hand outstretched, I began to\r\nback away from the attacking party; intending to take to my heels\r\nalong the first lane I came to.\r\n\r\nThis plan was sound enough; its weakness lay in the fact that I could\r\nmake no proper survey of that which lay immediately behind me. The\r\nresult was that I backed into someone who must have been stealthily\r\napproaching from the rear.\r\n\r\nI knew nothing of his presence until he suddenly threw himself upon\r\nfrom behind, and I was down on my face in the dust! My pistol was\r\njerked out of my hand, and, still preserving that unbroken\r\ndisconcerting silence, the muffled group bore down upon me.\r\n\r\nI gave myself up for lost. My unseen assailant, who seemingly\r\npossessed wrists of steel, jerked my right hand up into the region of\r\nmy shoulder-blades and pinioned my left arm so as to render me\r\nhelpless as an infant. Then two of the muffled Nubians--for Nubians\r\nthe moonlight now showed them to be--raised me to my feet, and the\r\ngrip from behind was removed.\r\n\r\nThat I had unwittingly intruded upon the amours of some wealthy and\r\nunscrupulous pasha I no longer doubted; and knowing somewhat of the\r\nways of outraged lovers of the East, the mental vision which arose\r\nbefore me was unpleasing to contemplate. Yet even the extravagant\r\npicture which my imagination had painted fell short of the ferocious\r\nreality. For even as I was lifted upright, in the grasp of my huge\r\nguards, a door in the side of the neighboring mosque burst open, and\r\nthere sprang into view an excessively tall, excessively lean and\r\nhawk-faced old man carrying a naked scimitar in his hand.\r\n\r\nHe possessed eyes like the eyes of an eagle, and a thin, hooked nose\r\nhaving dilated, quivering nostrils. In three huge strides he reached\r\nme, towered over me like some evil _ginnee_ of Arabian lore, and\r\nraised his gleaming scimitar with the unmistakable intention of\r\nsevering my head from my trunk at a single blow!\r\n\r\nI think I have never experienced an identical sensation in my life;\r\nmy tongue clave to the roof of my mouth; my heart suspended its\r\nfunctions; and I felt my eyes start forward in their sockets. I had\r\nnot thought my constitution capable of such profound and helpless\r\nfear, nor had I hitherto paid proper respect to the memory of Charles\r\nI. I would gladly have closed my eyes in order that I might not\r\nwitness the downward sweep of the fatal blade, but the lids seemed to\r\nbe paralysed. Never whilst memory serves me can I forget one detail of\r\nthe appearance of that frightful old devil; and never can I forget my\r\ngratitude to that unseen captor, the man who had seized me from\r\nbehind, and who now, alone, averted the blade from my neck.\r\n\r\nOver my head he lunged--with an ebony stick--and skilfully; so that\r\nthe pointed ferrule came well and truly into contact with the knuckles\r\nof my would-be executioner. The weapon fell, jingling, at my feet ...\r\nand a slim, black-robed figure was suddenly interposed between myself\r\nand the furious old Arab.\r\n\r\nIt was Abû Tabâh!\r\n\r\nDignified, unruffled, his classically beautiful face composed and\r\nresembling, in the moonlight, beneath the snowy turban, that of some\r\nyoung prophet, he stood, one protective hand resting upon my shoulder,\r\nand confronted my assailant. His eyes were aglow with the eerie light\r\nof fanaticism.\r\n\r\n\"It is written that the wrath of fools is the joy of Iblees,\"[A] he\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\n  [A] Satan.\r\n\r\nTheir glances met in conflict, the eagle eyes of my aged but\r\nformidable enemy glaring insanely into the fine, dark eyes of Abû\r\nTabâh. The Arab was by no means quelled; yet presently his glance fell\r\nbefore the hypnotic stare of the mysterious _imám_.\r\n\r\n\"The Prophet (may God be kind to him) spared not the despoiler!\" he\r\nsaid heavily. \"With these, my two hands\"--he extended the twitching,\r\nsinewy members before Abû Tabâh--\"will I choke the life from the\r\nthroat of the dog who wronged me.\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh raised his hand sternly.\r\n\r\n\"This matter has been entrusted to _me_,\" he said, staring down the\r\nenraged old man. \"If you would have me abandon it, say so; if you\r\nwould have me pursue it, be silent.\"\r\n\r\nFor five seconds the other sustained the strange gaze of those big,\r\nmysterious eyes, then folded his arms upon his breast, audibly\r\ngnashing his large and strong-looking teeth and averting his head from\r\nmy direction in order that spleen might not consume him. Abû Tabâh\r\nturned and confronted me.\r\n\r\n\"Explain the cause of your presence here,\" he demanded, continuing to\r\nspeak in Arabic, \"and unfold to me the whole truth respecting your\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" I replied, steadily regarding him, \"I am eternally your\r\ndebtor; but I decline to utter one word for explanation until these\r\nfellows unhand me and until I am offered some suitable excuse for the\r\noutrageous attack upon my person.\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh performed his curiously Gallic shrug of the shoulders--and\r\npointed, with his ebony cane, to my pinioned arms. In a trice the\r\nNubians fell back, and I was free. The infuriated old man directed\r\nupon me a glance that was bloodily ferocious, but--\r\n\r\n\"O persons of little piety,\" I said, \"is it thus that a true Moslem\r\nrewards the generous impulse and the meritorious deed? To-night a\r\ndamsel in distress, flying from a brutal captor, solicited my aid.\r\nI was treacherously assaulted ere I could escort her to a place of\r\nsafety, and all but murdered by the man who would appear to be that\r\ndamsel's natural protector. Alas, I fear to contemplate what may have\r\nbefallen her as a result of such vile and foolish conduct.\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh slightly inclined his body resting his slim, ivory hands\r\nupon his cane; his face remained perfectly tranquil as he listened to\r\nthis correct, though misleading statement; but--\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried the old man of the scimitar, adopting an unpleasant,\r\ncrouching attitude, \"perjured liar that thou art! Did I not see with\r\nmine own eyes how she embraced thee? O, son of a mange, that I should\r\nhave lived to have witnessed so obscene a spectacle. Not content with\r\ndespoiling me of this jewel of my _harêm_, thou dost parade her\r\nabandonment and my shame in the public highways of Cairo!...\"\r\n\r\nIn vain Abû Tabâh strove to check this tirade. Step by step the Sheikh\r\napproached closer; syllable by syllable his voice rose higher.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" he shrieked, \"is it for this that I have offered five thousand\r\nEnglish pounds to whomsoever shall restore her to me! Faugh! I spit\r\nupon her memory!--and though I pursue thee to the Mountains of the\r\nMoon, across the Bridge Es-Sîrat, and through the valley of Gahennam,\r\nlo! my hour will come to slay thee, noisome offal!\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased from lack of breath, and stood quivering before me. But at\r\nlast I had grasped the clue to this imbroglio into which fate had\r\nthrust me.\r\n\r\n\"O misguided man,\" I replied, \"grief hath upset thine intelligence.\r\nAgain I tell thee that I sought to deliver the damsel from her\r\npersecutor, and, perceiving an ambush, she clung to me as her only\r\nprotector. Thou are demented. Let another earn the paltry reward;\r\nI will have none of it.\"\r\n\r\nI turned to Abû Tabâh, addressing him in English.\r\n\r\n\"Relieve me of the society of this infatuated old ruffian,\" I said,\r\n\"and accompany me to some place where I can quietly explain what I\r\nknow of the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly I will accompany you to such a spot,\" he answered suavely;\r\n\"for whilst, knowing your character, I do not believe you to be the\r\nabductor of the damsel Mizmûna, a warrant to search your house was\r\nissued an hour ago, on a charge of _hashish_ smuggling!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThere are certain shocks that numb the brain. This was one of them.\r\nMy recollection of the period immediately following those words of Abû\r\nTabâh is hazy and indistinct. My narrow escape from decapitation at\r\nthe hands of the ferocious Arab assassin and the tangled love-affairs\r\nof that aged Othello became insignificant memories. (I seem to\r\nrecollect that we left him in tears.)\r\n\r\nMy next clear-cut memory is that of walking beside the mysterious\r\n_imâm_ along the Darb el-Ahmar and of stopping before the closed door\r\nof my newly acquired premises!\r\n\r\nThe street was quite deserted again. Those muffled Nubians who seemed\r\nto constitute a bodyguard for my inscrutable companion had disappeared\r\nin company with the bereaved Sheikh.\r\n\r\n\"This is your house?\" said Abû Tabâh sweetly.\r\n\r\nMy habit of thinking before I speak or act asserted itself\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\n\"I recently leased it on another's behalf,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"In that event,\" continued the _imâm_, \"unless the information lodged\r\nwith me to-night prove to be inaccurate, that other must speedily\r\nproclaim himself.\"\r\n\r\nHe tested the cumbersome lock, and, as I knew would be the case, since\r\nMizmûna had recently entered, found it to be unfastened, opened the\r\ndoor and stepped in.\r\n\r\n\"Have you a pocket lamp?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nI pressed the button of my electric torch and directed its rays fully\r\nupon the stack of boxes. It was the great sage, Apollonius of Tyana,\r\nwho said \"loquacity has many pitfalls, but silence none\"; therefore I\r\nsilently watched Abû Tabâh consulting the label on the topmost chest.\r\nPresently--\r\n\r\n\"Ahmed Ben Tawwab,\" he read aloud; \"is that the name of the friend on\r\nwhose behalf you secured a lease of this house?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"If you will rest the light upon this box and assist me to open one of\r\nthe others, I shall be obliged to you,\" said Abû Tabâh.\r\n\r\nKnowing, as I did, that this strange man was in some way connected\r\nwith the native police and with the guardianship of Egyptian morals,\r\nI recognized refusal to be impolitic if not impossible. But, as we set\r\nto work to raise the lid of the chest, my mind was more feverishly\r\nbusy than my fingers.\r\n\r\nEre long our task was successful, and the contents of the chest lay\r\nexposed. These were: two hundred Osiris statuettes, twelve one-pound\r\ntins of mummy heads ... _and fifty packets of hashish_.\r\n\r\nSilence was no effort to me now; I was dumbfounded. The musical voice\r\nof my companion broke in upon my painful reverie.\r\n\r\n\"The information upon which I now am acting,\" he said, \"reached me\r\nto-night in the form of a letter, bearing no address and no\r\nsignature. The suppression of this vile _hashish_ traffic is so near\r\nto my heart that I immediately secured the necessary powers to search\r\nthe premises named, and was on my way hither when I observed you\r\n(although I did not at once recognize you) in the act of escaping from\r\na group of my servants who had been detailed, some weeks ago, to trace\r\na missing damsel known to be in Cairo. Concerning your share in that\r\naffair I await a full statement from your own lips; concerning your\r\nshare in this I can only say that unless Ahmed Ben Tawwab comes\r\nforward by to-morrow and admits his guilt, I must apply to the British\r\nagent for a formal inquiry. Is there anything that you would wish to\r\nsay, or any action you desire that I should take?\"\r\n\r\nI turned to him in the dim light. Habitually I am undemonstrative,\r\nespecially with natives. But there was a nobility and an implacable\r\nsense of justice about this singular _religieux_ which conquered me\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n\"Abû Tabâh,\" I said, \"I thank you for your friendship. I have\r\ncommitted a grave folly; but I am neither an abductor nor a _hashish_\r\ndealer. This is the work of an unknown enemy, and already I have a\r\ntheory respecting his identity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I aid you--or do you prefer that I leave you to pursue this clue\r\nin your own way?\" he asked tactfully.\r\n\r\n\"I prefer to work alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"The affair is truly mysterious,\" he admitted, \"and I purpose to\r\nspend the night in meditation respecting it. After the hour of morning\r\nprayer, therefore, I will visit you. _Lîltâk sa'îda_, Kernaby Pasha.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Lîltâk sa'îda_, Abû Tabâh,\" I said, as he stepped out of the door.\r\n\r\nSlowly and stately the _imám_ passed down the street; and the _ginnee_\r\nof solitude reclaimed that deserted spot. A night watchman, _nebbut_\r\non shoulder, passed along the distant Sukkarîya. A dog howled.\r\n\r\nI re-entered the doorway conscious of a sudden mental excitement; for\r\nan explanation of the anonymous letter had just presented itself to\r\nmy mind. The owner of the neighboring house must have detected my\r\nrendezvous with his lady-love, have investigated the contents of the\r\ncases, and denounced me from motives of revenge! That the villainous\r\nJoseph Malaglou had been in the habit of smuggling _hashish_ into\r\nEgypt in my cases of \"cutlery\" was evident enough and accounted for\r\nhis reluctance to fall in with the new arrangement; but my bemused\r\nbrain utterly failed to grapple with the problem of why, knowing their\r\ndamning contents, he had permitted these ten cases to be delivered\r\nat _my_ address. Moreover, how my worthy neighbor--who had evidently\r\nabducted Mizmûna from the old man of the scimitar--had learned my\r\nreal name was another mystery which I found no leisure to examine.\r\nFor I had but just set foot again within the ill-omened place when\r\nthere came a patter of swift, light footsteps--and out from behind\r\nthe fatal stack of boxes ran Mizmûna, and threw herself into my arms!\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my friend, my protector!\" she cried distractedly, \"what shall I\r\ndo? Yûssuf has discovered our plot! Fatimah, that mother of\r\ncalamities, has betrayed me, and I dare not return! I am an outcast;\r\nfor although I was stolen from the Sheikh Ismail without my consent,\r\nhow can I hope for his forgiveness?\"\r\n\r\nSuch a flood of sorrows and confidences overwhelmed me, and I placed a\r\nsilent but deathless curse upon the lapis armlet which had brought me\r\nto this pass. Mizmûna sobbed upon my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Yûssuf has planned your ruin as well as mine,\" she said brokenly.\r\n\"For it was he who denounced you to the Magician.\" (As \"the Magician\"\r\nAbû Tabâh was known and feared throughout Lower Egypt.) \"Oh that I\r\nmight return to the house of Ismail where I lived in luxury in a\r\nmarble pavilion, guarded by Hanna and a hundred negroes, where I\r\npossessed the robes of a princess and was laden with costly jewels!\"\r\n\r\nSo very human and natural an ambition met with my hearty approval,\r\nand, upon consideration of the word-picture of his domestic state, the\r\nold man of the scimitar rose immensely in my esteem. How my malevolent\r\nneighbor had succeeded in abducting Mizmûna from such a fortress I\r\nfailed to imagine. But I began to see my way more clearly and hope was\r\nreborn in my bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Fear nothing, child,\" I said to the weeping girl. \"You shall return\r\nto your marble pavilion and to the care of that worthy, if somewhat\r\nhasty man, from whose arms you were torn. And now inform me--where is\r\nYûssuf?\"\r\n\r\nMizmûna raised her face and looked up at me, her long lashes wet with\r\ntears, but the slow, childish smile of the Eastern woman already\r\ncurving her red lips.\r\n\r\n\"He is in his own room destroying papers,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Who told you this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ali, the _bowwab_, who is faithful to me--and who hates Fatimah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the trap rebolted?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remain here until I return,\" I said, seating her upon one of the\r\nboxes. \"Where are my keys?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hid them upon the ledge of the window, beside the door yonder.\"\r\n\r\nTaking them from this simple \"hiding-place,\" I locked the door to\r\ngive Mizmûna courage, and, taking the lamp with me, began to mount\r\nthe stairs, first assuring myself of the presence in my pocket of\r\nmy Colt automatic, which Abû Tabâh had restored to me.\r\n\r\nThe ray of my lamp shining out ahead, I came to the crazy ladder\r\ngiving access to the trap. I climbed up, raising the trap, and gazed\r\nupon the jeweled dome of midnight Egypt. Dire necessity spurred me,\r\nand I walked across to the adjoining trap, carefully inserted two\r\nfingers in the iron ring and pulled.\r\n\r\nIt was not fastened below! Inch by inch I raised it, and, finding the\r\nroom beneath it to be in darkness, opened the trap fully and descended\r\nthe ladder.\r\n\r\nI flashed the light quickly about the place; then stood staring at\r\nwhat it revealed. My heart began to beat rapidly, for in that dirty\r\nattic I had found salvation ... and a further clue to the mystery of\r\nall my misfortunes.\r\n\r\nIt was a _hashish_ warehouse!\r\n\r\nTaking off my shoes, I thrust one into either pocket of my jacket,\r\nand, perceiving that the house was constructed on a plan identical\r\nwith that adjoining it, I crept downstairs to the apartment of the\r\n_mushrabîyeh_ window. A heavy curtain was draped in the doorway, but\r\nI could see that the room within was illuminated.\r\n\r\nI drew the curtains slowly aside and peeped in. I saw an apartment\r\nthat had evidently been furnished very luxuriantly, but which now was\r\npartially dismantled. In the recess formed by the window a low table\r\nwas placed, bearing a shaded lamp. The table was littered with papers,\r\naccount books and ledgers; and, seated thereat, his back towards the\r\ndoor, was a man who figured feverishly. I stepped into the room.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, Yûssuf of Rosetta,\" I said; \"you do well to set your\r\naffairs in order.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nSwiftly as though a serpent had touched him, the man in the recess\r\nleaped to his feet and twisted about to confront me.\r\n\r\nI found myself looking into a hideous, swarthy face--blanched now to\r\nthe lips, so that the cunning black eyes glared out as from a\r\nmask--into the hideous swarthy face of _Joseph Malaglou_!\r\n\r\nThe store of _hashish_ in the upper room had somewhat prepared me for\r\nthis discovery; yet, momentarily, the consummate villainy of the Greek\r\nhad me bereft of speech. As I stood there glaring at him, he began\r\nfurtively to grope with one hand along the edge of the _dîwan_ behind\r\nhim. Then, suddenly, he became aware of the pistol which I\r\ncarried--and abandoned the quest of whatever weapon he had sought,\r\nswallowing audibly.\r\n\r\n\"So, my good Malaglou,\" I said, \"you sought to make me responsible for\r\nyour sins, my friend? I perceive now how the Fates have played with\r\nme. My very first conversation with your charming protégée----\"\r\n\r\nHe bit savagely at his black moustache, advanced upon me; then, his\r\ngaze set upon the Colt, he stood still again.\r\n\r\n\"... was reported to you by the traitorous Fatimah,\" I continued\r\nevenly; \"and, when, on the morrow, I advised you of my new address,\r\nthe identity of the hitherto unknown Romeo who had raised his eyes to\r\nyour Juliet became apparent. You doubtless had designed to unpack my\r\nboxes for me as you have been in the habit of doing; but green-eyed\r\njealousy suggested how, by the sacrifice of only one consignment of\r\n_hashish_, you might wreak my ruin. I disapprove of your morals,\r\nMalaglou. My own code may be peculiar, but it does not embrace\r\n_hashish_ dealing; therefore, Malaglou, you are about to take a sheet\r\nof note-paper--bearing your office heading--and write from my\r\ndictation....\"\r\n\r\n\"And suppose I refuse? You dare not shoot me!\"\r\n\r\n\"You little know my true character, Malaglou. But I should not shoot\r\nyou, as you say; I should introduce you to a gentleman who is very\r\nanxious to make your acquaintance--the venerable Sheikh Ismail.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this remark greatly exceeded my most sanguine\r\nexpectations. I think I have never seen a man so pitiably frightened.\r\n\r\n\"The Sheikh ... Ismail!\" gasped Joseph Malaglou. \"He is in Cairo?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has generously offered me five thousand pounds for your name and\r\naddress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my God!\" whispered Malaglou. \"Kernaby, you will not betray me\r\nto that fiend? You are an Englishman and you will not soil your hands\r\nwith such a deed!\"\r\n\r\nTo my dismay--for it was a disgusting sight--Malaglou fell trembling\r\nupon his knees before me. The threat of shooting had had no such\r\neffect as the mere name of the Sheikh Ismail. My respect for that\r\nreally remarkable old ruffian rose by leaps and bounds.\r\n\r\n\"Get up,\" I said harshly, \"and, if you can, write.\"\r\n\r\nHe obeyed me; the man was almost hysterical. And, very shakily, this\r\nis what he wrote:\r\n\r\n  \"I, Joseph Malaglou, also known as _Ahmed Ben Tawwab_, confess\r\n  that I am a dealer in _hashish_ and spurious antiques, which I have\r\n  been in the habit of storing at my warehouse in Cairo, and also in\r\n  my private residence in the Darb el Ahmar. Finding it desirable to\r\n  enlarge the facilities of the latter, I induced the Hon. Neville\r\n  Kernaby, who is ignorant of my real business, to lease for me a\r\n  house which adjoins my own, as I did not desire it to be known that\r\n  I was the lessee. Subsequently, learning that the suspicions of the\r\n  authorities had been aroused, I anonymously denounced Kernaby, thus\r\n  hoping to avert suspicion from myself and cause his arrest as the\r\n  consignee of the cases which had been delivered at the new\r\n  premises.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" I said, when this precious document had been completed.\r\n\"You understand that you will now accompany me to the central police\r\nstation in the Place Bâb el-Khalk and sign this confession in the\r\npresence of suitable witnesses? You will doubtless be detained;\r\ntherefore in the interests of your safety, we must arrange that\r\nMizmûna be hidden securely until the case is settled. Oh! set your\r\nevil mind at rest! I shall not betray you to the Sheikh; unless--\"\r\nI looked him squarely in the eyes--\"any whisper of my name appears\r\nin this matter!\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is she?\" he said hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"She is hiding in the adjoining house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a small place at Shubra where I can conceal her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. I will bring her here and permit you to make suitable\r\narrangements, but let them be complete; for if Ismail should find the\r\ngirl and thus discover your identity, nothing could save you--and you\r\nwill be unable to leave Cairo (I shall see to that) until the case is\r\nsettled.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIt was on the following evening, as I sat smoking upon the terrace of\r\nthe hotel and reflecting upon the execrably bad luck which pursued me,\r\nthat I observed Abû Tabâh mounting the carpeted steps with slow and\r\nstately carriage. He saluted me gravely and accepted the seat which I\r\noffered him.\r\n\r\nMy plan had run smoothly; Malaglou had given himself up to the\r\nauthorities, but had been released upon payment of a substantial bail.\r\nMizmûna was concealed at Shubra, and I was flogging my brain in a vain\r\nendeavor to conjure up a plan whereby, without betraying the\r\nvillainous Greek and thus causing him to betray _me_, I might secure\r\nthe Sheikh's reward--or, at least, the lapis armlet.\r\n\r\n\"Alas,\" said Abû Tabâh, \"that the wicked should prosper.\"\r\n\r\n\"To whose prosperity,\" I inquired, \"do you more especially refer?\"\r\n\r\nHe regarded me with his fine melancholy eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You have an English adage,\" he continued, \"which says, 'set a thief\r\nto catch a thief.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. But might I inquire what bearing this crystallized wisdom\r\nhas upon our present conversation?\"\r\n\r\n\"The man, Joseph Malaglou,\" he replied, \"learning of the hue-and-cry\r\nafter a certain missing damsel----\"\r\n\r\nI remember I was about to light a cigar as he uttered those words, but\r\na dawning perception of the iniquitous truth crept poisonously into my\r\nmind, and I threw both cigar and matches over the rail into the Shâra\r\nKâmel and clutched fiercely at the little table between us.\r\n\r\n\"And of the reward offered for her recovery,\" pursued the _imám_,\r\n\"denounced to us, one Yûssuf of Rosetta, a man owning a small house at\r\nShubra. Yûssuf had fled, and the only occupant of the place was the\r\nmissing damsel Mizmûna. Alas that fortune should so favor the sinful.\r\nThe abductor, the despoiler, escapes retribution; and the traitor, the\r\ninformer, the dealer in _hashish_ is rewarded.\"\r\n\r\nThe Turk has signally failed to rule Egypt; but there are certain\r\nOttoman institutions which are not without claims, as I realized at\r\nthat moment in regard to Joseph Malaglou: I was thinking,\r\nparticularly, of the bow-string.\r\n\r\n\"Already,\" said Abû Tabâh, with his sweet but melancholy smile, \"the\r\nheart of the Sheikh Ismail inclined toward the damsel, for whom his\r\nsoul yearned; and has not it been written that he who heals the breach\r\nbetwixt man and wife shall himself be blessed? Behold the reward of\r\nthe peace-maker--which I design as a gift to my sister.\"\r\n\r\nI was unable to speak, but I became aware of a bitter taste upon my\r\npalate as, from beneath his robe, the smiling _imám_ took out the\r\narmlet of gold and lapis-lazuli!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOMAR OF ISPAHAN\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\"I hear that the Harêm Suite is occupied,\" said Sir Bertram Collis,\r\nbustling up to me as I sat smoking in the gardens of a certain Cairo\r\nhotel, which I shall not name because of the matters that befell\r\nthere. \"Daphne is full of curiosity respecting the romantic occupant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let Lady Collis be too sure,\" put in Chundermeyer, \"that there\r\nis anything romantic about the occupant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your definition of romance, Chundermeyer,\" I interrupted, \"would\r\nprobably be 'a diamond the size of a Spanish onion.'\"\r\n\r\nChundermeyer smiled, but it was a smile in which his dark eyes,\r\ntwinkling through the pebbles of horn-rimmed spectacles, played no\r\npart. I must confess that the society of this unctuous partner in the\r\nwell-known Madras firm of Isaacs and Chundermeyer palled somewhat at\r\ntimes. He, on the other hand, was eternally dropping into a chair\r\nbeside me, and proffering huge and costly cigars from a huge and\r\ncostly case. This sort of parvenu persecution is one of the penalties\r\nof being recognized by Debrett.\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of fact,\" I continued, \"the occupant of the Harêm Suite\r\nis no less romantic a personage than the daughter of the Mudîr\r\n(Governor) of the Fayûm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really!\" said Chundermeyer, with that sudden interest which mention\r\nof a title always aroused in him. \"Surely it is most unusual for so\r\nhighly placed a Moslem lady to reside at an hotel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most unusual,\" I replied. \"Of course such a thing would be\r\ninconceivable in India; but the management of this establishment, who\r\ncater almost exclusively to tourists, find, I am told, that a 'harêm\r\nsuite' is quite a good advertisement. The reason of the presence of\r\nthis lady in the hotel is a diplomatic one. She is visiting Cairo in\r\norder to witness the procession of Ashûra, peculiarly sacred to\r\nEgyptian women, and it appears that, having no blood relations here,\r\nshe could not accept the hospitality of any one of the big families\r\nwithout alienating the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" said Sir Bertram, \"I must tell Daphne this yarn. She'll be\r\ndelighted! Come along, Kernaby; if we're to have tea at Mena House, it\r\nis high time we were off.\"\r\n\r\nI left Chundermeyer to his opulent cigar without regret. That he was\r\nan astute man of affairs and an expert lapidary I did not doubt, for\r\nhe had offered to buy my Hatshepsu scarab ring at a price exactly ten\r\nper cent below its trade value; but to my mind there is something\r\nalmost as unnatural about a Hindu-Hebrew as about a Græco-Welshman or\r\na griffin.\r\n\r\nOf course, Daphne Collis was not ready; and, Sir Bertram going up to\r\ntheir apartments to induce her to hurry, I strolled out again into the\r\ngardens for a quiet cigarette and a cocktail. As I approached a\r\nsuitable seat in a sort of charming little arbor festooned with purple\r\nblossom, a man who had been waiting there rose to greet me.\r\n\r\nWith a certain quickening of the pulse, I recognized Abû Tabâh,\r\narrayed, as was his custom, in black, only relieved by a small snowy\r\nturban, which served to enhance the ascetic beauty of his face and the\r\nmystery of the wonderful, liquid eyes.\r\n\r\nHe inclined his head in that gesture of gentle dignity which I knew;\r\nand:\r\n\r\n\"I have been awaiting an opportunity of speech with you, Kernaby\r\nPasha,\" he said, in his flawless, musical English, \"upon a matter in\r\nwhich I hope you will consent to aid me.\"\r\n\r\nSince this mysterious man, variously known as \"the _imám_\" and \"the\r\nMagician,\" but whom I knew to be some kind of secret agent of the\r\nEgyptian Government, had recently saved me from assassination, to\r\ndecline to aid him was out of the question. We seated ourselves in the\r\narbor.\r\n\r\n\"I should welcome an opportunity of serving you, my friend,\" I assured\r\nhim, \"since your services to me can never be repaid.\"\r\n\r\nHis lips moved slightly in the curiously tender smile which a poor\r\nphysiognomist might have mistaken for evidence of effeminacy, bending\r\ntowards me with a cautious glance about.\r\n\r\n\"You are staying at this hotel throughout the Christmas festivities?\"\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I have temporarily deserted Shepheard's in order to accept the\r\nhospitality of Sir Bertram Collis, a very old friend. I shall probably\r\nreturn on the Tuesday following Christmas Day.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is to be a carnival and masquerade ball here to-morrow. You\r\nshall be present?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" I replied in surprise. \"To what does all this tend?\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh bent yet closer.\r\n\r\n\"Many of your friends and acquaintances possess valuable jewels?\"\r\n\r\n\"They do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then warn them--individually, in order to occasion no general\r\nalarm--to guard these with the utmost care.\"\r\n\r\nMy surprise increased. \"You alarm me,\" I said. \"Are there rogues in\r\nour midst?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the _imám_, fixing his melancholy gaze upon my face;\r\n\"so far as my knowledge bears me, there is but one, yet that one is\r\nworse than a host of others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that he is here--in the hotel?\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh shrugged his slim shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"If I knew his exact whereabouts,\" he replied, \"there would be no\r\noccasion to fear him. All that I know is that he is in Cairo; and\r\nsince many richly attired women of Europe and America will be here\r\nto-morrow night, of a surety Omar Ali Khân will be here also!\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head in perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"Omar Ali Khân?\"----I began.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" continued Abû Tabâh, \"to you that name conveys nothing, but to\r\nme it signifies Omar of Ispahân, 'the Father of Thieves.' Do you\r\nremember,\" fixing his strange eyes hypnotically upon me, \"the theft\r\nof the sacred _burko_ of Nefîseh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite well,\" I replied hastily; since the incident represented an\r\nunpleasant memory.\r\n\r\n\"It was Omar of Ispahân who stole it from the shrine. It was Omar of\r\nIspahân who stole the blue diamond of the Rajah of Bagore from the\r\ntreasure-room at Jullapore, and Omar of Ispahân\"--lowering his voice\r\nalmost to a whisper--\"who stole the Holy Carpet ere it reached Mecca!\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I cried. \"When did that happen? I never heard of such an\r\nepisode!\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh raised his long, slim hand warningly.\r\n\r\n\"Be cautious!\" he whispered; \"the flowers of the garden, the palms in\r\nthe grove, the very sands of the desert have ears! The lightest word\r\nspoken in the _harêm_ of the Khedive, or breathed from a minaret of\r\nthe Citadel, is heard by Omar of Ispahân! The holy covering for the\r\nKaaba was restored, on payment of a ruinous ransom by the Sherîf of\r\nMecca, and none save the few ever knew of its loss.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time I was silent; words failed me; for the veil of the Kaaba,\r\nmiscalled \"the Carpet,\" is about the size of a bowling-green; then--\r\n\r\n\"In what manner does this affair concern you, Abû Tabâh?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"In this way: the daughter of the Mudîr el-Fáyûm is here, in order\r\nthat she may be present on the Night of Ashûra in the Mûski. For a\r\nMoslem lady to stay in such a place as this\"--there was a faint note\r\nof contempt in the speaker's voice--\"is without precedent, but the\r\ncircumstances are peculiar. The _khân_ near the Mosque of Hosein is\r\nfull, and it is not seemly that the Mudîr's daughter should live at\r\nany lesser establishment. Therefore, as she brings her two servants,\r\nit has been possible for her to remain here. But\"--his voice sank\r\nagain--\"her ornaments are famed throughout Islâm.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded comprehendingly.\r\n\r\n\"To me,\" Abû Tabâh whispered, \"has been entrusted the task of guarding\r\nthem; to you, I entrust that of guarding the possessions of the other\r\nguests!\"\r\n\r\nI started.\r\n\r\n\"But, my friend,\" I said, \"this is a dreadful responsibility which you\r\nimpose upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Other precautions are being taken,\" he replied calmly; \"but you,\r\nobserving great circumspection, can speak to the guests, and, being\r\nforewarned of his presence, can even watch for the coming of Omar of\r\nIspahân.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe effect of my news upon Lady Collis was truly dramatic.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she cried, \"my rope of pearls. Mr. Chundermeyer only told me\r\nlast week that it was worth at least two hundred pound more than I\r\ngave for it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chundermeyer had made himself popular with many of the ladies in\r\nthe hotel by similar diplomatic means, but I think that if he had been\r\ncompelled to purchase at his own flattering valuations Messrs. Isaacs\r\nand Chundermeyer would have been ruined.\r\n\r\n\"You need not wear it, my dear,\" said her husband tactlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be so ridiculous!\" she retorted. \"You know I have brought my\r\nQueen of Sheba costume for to-morrow night.\"\r\n\r\nThat, of course, settled the matter, so that beyond making one pretty\r\nwoman extremely nervous, my campaign against the dreaded Omar of\r\nIspahân had opened--blankly. Later in the day I circulated my warning\r\nright and left, and everywhere sowed consternation without reaping any\r\nappreciable result.\r\n\r\n\"One naturally expects thieves on these occasions,\" said a little\r\nChicago millionairess, \"and if I only wore my diamonds when no rogues\r\nwere about, I might as well have none. There are crooks in America I'd\r\nback against your Persian thief any day.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I think, the best audience for my dramatic recitation\r\nwas provided by Mr. Chundermeyer, whom I found in the American bar,\r\njust before the dinner hour. His yellow skin perceptibly blanched at\r\nmy first mention of Omar Ali Khân, and one hand clutched at a bulging\r\nbreast pocket of the dinner-jacket he wore.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, Mr. Kernaby,\" he said, \"you alarm me--you alarm me,\r\nsir!\"\r\n\r\n\"The reputation of Omar is not unknown to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means unknown to me,\" he responded in the thick, unctuous voice\r\nwhich betrayed the Semitic strain in his pedigree. \"It was this man\r\nwho stole the pair of blue diamonds from the Rajah of Bagore.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I am told.\"\r\n\r\n\"But have you been told that it was my firm who bought those diamonds\r\nfor the Rajah?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; that is news to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was my firm, Mr. Kernaby, who negotiated the sale of the blue\r\ndiamonds to the Rajah; therefore the particulars of their loss, under\r\nmost extraordinary circumstances, are well known to me. You have made\r\nme very nervous. Who is your informant?\"\r\n\r\n\"A member of the native police with whom I am acquainted.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chundermeyer shook his head lugubriously.\r\n\r\n\"I am conveying a parcel of rough stones to Amsterdam,\" he confessed,\r\nglancing warily about him over the rims of his spectacles, \"and I feel\r\nvery much disposed to ask for more reliable protection than is offered\r\nby your Egyptian friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not lodge the stones in a bank, or in the manager's safe?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head again, and proffered an enormous cigar.\r\n\r\n\"I distrust all safes but my own,\" he replied. \"I prefer to carry such\r\nvaluables upon my person, foolish though the plan may seem to you. But\r\ndo you observe that squarely built, military looking person standing\r\nat the bar, in conversation with M. Balabas, the manager?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; an officer, I should judge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely; a _police_ officer. That is Chief Inspector Carlisle of\r\nNew Scotland Yard.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he is a guest here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. The management sustained a severe loss last Christmas\r\nduring the progress of a ball at which all Cairo was present, and as\r\nthe inspector chanced to be on his way home from India, where official\r\nbusiness had taken him, M. Balabas induced him to break his journey\r\nand remain until after the carnival.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment,\" I said; \"I will bring him over.\"\r\n\r\nCrossing to the bar, I greeted Balabas, with whom I was acquainted,\r\nand--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chundermeyer and I have been discussing the notorious Omar of\r\nIspahân, who is said to be in Cairo,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\nInspector Carlisle, being introduced, smiled broadly.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Balabas is very nervous about this Omar man,\" he replied, with\r\na slight Scottish accent; \"but, considering that everybody has been\r\nwarned, I don't see myself that he can do much damage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you would be good enough to reassure Mr. Chundermeyer,\"\r\nI suggested, \"who is carrying valuables.\"\r\n\r\nChief Inspector Carlisle walked over to the table at which\r\nChundermeyer was seated.\r\n\r\n\"I have met your partner, sir,\" he said, \"and I gathered that you\r\nwere on your way to Amsterdam with a parcel of rough stones; in fact,\r\nI supposed that you had arrived there by now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am fond of Cairo during the Christmas season,\" explained the other,\r\n\"and I broke my journey. But now I sincerely wish I were elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I shouldn't worry!\" said the detective cheerily. \"There are\r\nenough of us on the look-out.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Chundermeyer remained palpably uneasy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe gardens of the hotel on the following night presented a fairy-like\r\nspectacle. Lights concealed among the flower-beds, the bloom-covered\r\narbors, and the feathery leafage of the acacias, suffused a sort of\r\nweird glow, suggesting the presence of a million fire-flies. Up\r\nbeneath the crowns of the lofty palms little colored electric lamps\r\nwere set, producing an illusion of supernatural fruit, whilst the\r\nfountain had been magically converted into a cascade of fire.\r\n\r\nIn the ball-room, where the orchestra played, and a hundred mosque\r\nlamps bathed the apartment in soft illumination, a cosmopolitan throng\r\ndanced around a giant Christmas tree, their costumes a clash of color\r\nto have filled a theatrical producer with horror, outraging history\r\nand linking the ages in startling fashion. Thus, St. Antony of the\r\nThebäid danced with Salome, the luresome daughter of Herodias; Nero's\r\narm was about the waist of Good Queen Bess; Charles II cantered\r\nthrough a two-step with a red-haired Vestal Virgin; and the Queen of\r\nSheba (Daphne Collis) had no less appropriate a partner than Sherlock\r\nHolmes.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it was all very amusing, but, personally, I stand by my\r\ncommonplace dress-suit, having, perhaps, rather a ridiculous sense\r\nof dignity. Inspector Carlisle also was soberly arrayed, and we had\r\nseveral chats during the evening; he struck me as being a man of\r\nconsiderable culture and great shrewdness.\r\n\r\nFor Abû Tabâh I looked in vain. Following our conversation on the\r\nprevious afternoon, he had vanished like a figment of a dream. I\r\nseveral times saw Chundermeyer, who had elected to disguise himself\r\nas Al-Mokanna, the Veiled Prophet of Khorassan. He seemed to be an\r\nenthusiastic dancer, and there was no lack of partners.\r\n\r\nBut of these mandarins, pierrots, Dutch girls, monks, and court ladies\r\nI speedily tired, and sought refuge in the gardens, whose enchanted\r\naspect was completed by that wondrous inverted bowl, jewel-studded,\r\nwhich is the nightly glory of Egypt. In the floral, dim-lighted arbors\r\nmany romantic couples shrank from the peeping moon; but quiet and a\r\nhushful sense of peace ruled there beneath the stars more in harmony\r\nwith my mood.\r\n\r\nOne corner of the gardens, in particular, seemed to be quite deserted,\r\nand it was the most picturesque spot of all. For here a graceful palm\r\nupstood before an outjutting _mushrabîyeh_ window, dimly lighted, over\r\nwhich trailed a wealth of bougainvillea blossom, whilst beneath it lay\r\na floral carpet, sharply bisected by the shadow of the palm trunk. It\r\nwas like some gorgeous illustration to a poem by Hafiz, only lacking\r\nthe figure at the window.\r\n\r\nAnd as I stood, enchanted, before the picture, the central panels of\r\nthe window were thrown open, and, as if conjured up by my imagination,\r\na woman appeared, looking out into the gardens--an Oriental woman,\r\nrobed in shimmering, moon-kissed white, and wearing a white _yashmak_.\r\nHer arms and fingers were laden with glittering jewels.\r\n\r\nI almost held my breath, drawing back into the sheltering shadow, for\r\nI had not hitherto suspected myself of being a sorcerer. For perhaps\r\na minute, or less, she stood looking out, then the window closed, and\r\nthe white phantom disappeared. I recovered myself, recognizing that I\r\nstood before the isolated wing of the hotel known as the Harêm Suite,\r\nand that Fate had granted me a glimpse of the daughter of the Mudîr of\r\nthe Fáyûm.\r\n\r\nRecollecting, in the nick of time, an engagement to dance with Lady\r\nCollis, I hurried back to the ball-room. On its very threshold I\r\nencountered Chundermeyer. I could see his spectacles glittering\r\nthrough the veil of his ridiculous costume, and even before he spoke\r\nI detected about him an aura of tragedy.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Kernaby,\" he gasped, \"for Heaven's sake help me to find Inspector\r\nCarlisle! I have been robbed!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"My diamonds!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean----\"\r\n\r\n\"Find the inspector, and come to my rooms. I am nearly mad!\"\r\n\r\nDaphne Collis, who had seen me enter, joined us at this moment, and,\r\noverhearing the latter part of Chundermeyer's speech:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, whatever is the matter?\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nAs for Chundermeyer the effect upon him of her sudden appearance was\r\npositively magical. He stared through his veil as though her charming\r\nfigure had been that of some hideous phantom. Then slowly, as if he\r\ndreaded to find her intangible, he extended one hand and touched her\r\nrope of pearls.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, heavens!\" he gasped. \"I am really going mad, or is there a\r\nmagician amongst us?\"\r\n\r\nDaphne Collis's blue eyes opened very widely, and the color slowly\r\nfaded from her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chundermeyer,\" she began. But--\r\n\r\n\"Let us go into this little recess, where there is a good light,\"\r\nmumbled Chundermeyer shakily, \"and I will make sure.\"\r\n\r\nThe three of us entered the palm-screened alcove, Chundermeyer\r\nleading. He stood immediately under a lamp suspended by brass chains\r\nfrom the roof.\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to examine your pearls for one moment,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHer hands trembling, Daphne Collis took off the costly ornament and\r\nplaced it in the hands of the greatly perturbed expert. Chundermeyer\r\nran the pearls through his fingers, then lifted the largest of the set\r\ntowards the light and scrutinized it closely. Suddenly he dropped his\r\narms, and extended the necklace upon one open palm.\r\n\r\n\"Look for yourself,\" he said slowly. \"It does not require the eyes of\r\nan expert.\"\r\n\r\nDaphne Collis snatched the pearls and stared at them dazedly. Her\r\npretty face was now quite colorless.\r\n\r\n\"This is not my rope of pearls,\" she said, in a monotonous voice; \"it\r\nis a very poor imitation!\"\r\n\r\nEre I could frame any kind of speech--\r\n\r\n\"Look at this,\" groaned Chundermeyer, \"as you talk of a poor\r\nimitation!\"\r\n\r\nHe was holding out a leather-covered box, plush-lined, and bearing\r\nwithin the words, \"Isaacs and Chundermeyer, Madras.\" Nestling\r\ngrotesquely amid the blue velvet were six small pieces of coal!\r\n\r\nChundermeyer sank upon the cushions of the settee, tossing the casket\r\nupon a little coffee table.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I feel unwell,\" he said feebly. \"Mr. Kernaby, I wonder if\r\nyou would be so kind as to find Inspector Carlisle, and ask a waiter\r\nto bring me some cognac.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do?\" whispered poor Daphne Collis.\r\n\r\n\"Just remain here,\" I said soothingly, \"with Mr. Chundermeyer.\" And I\r\ninduced her to sit in a big cane rest-chair. \"I will return in a\r\nmoment with Bertram and the inspector.\"\r\n\r\nDesiring to avoid a panic, I walked quietly into the ball-room and\r\ntook stock of the dancers, for a waltz was in progress. The inspector\r\nI could not see, but Sir Bertram I observed at the further end of the\r\nfloor, dancing with Mrs. Van Heysten, the Chicago lady whom I had\r\nwarned to keep a close watch upon her diamonds.\r\n\r\nI managed to attract Collis's attention, and the pair, quitting the\r\nfloor, joined me where I stood. A few words sufficed in which to\r\ninform them of the catastrophe, and, pointing out the alcove wherein\r\nI had left Chundermeyer and Lady Collis, I set off in search of\r\nInspector Carlisle.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, having visited every likely spot, I came to the\r\nconclusion that he was not in the hotel, and with M. Balabas I\r\nreturned to the alcove adjoining the ball-room. Dancing was in full\r\nswing, and I thought as we passed along the edge of the floor how\r\neasily I could have checked the festivities by announcing that Omar\r\nof Ispahân was present.\r\n\r\nThe first sight to greet me upon entering the little palm-shaded\r\nalcove was that of Mrs. Van Heysten in tears. She had discovered\r\nherself to be wearing a very indifferent duplicate of her famous\r\ndiamond tiara.\r\n\r\nI think it was my action of soothingly patting her upon the shoulder\r\nthat drew Chundermeyer's attention to my Hatshepsu scarab.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Kernaby!\" he cried--\"Mr. Kernaby!\" And pointed to my finger.\r\n\r\nI had had the scarab set in a revolving bezel, and habitually wore it\r\nwith its beetle uppermost and the cartouche concealed. As I glanced\r\ndown at the ring, Chundermeyer stretched out his hand and detached it\r\nfrom my finger. Approaching the light, he turned the bezel.\r\n\r\nThe flat part of the scarab was quite blank, bearing no inscription\r\nwhatever. Like Lady Collis's rope of pearls, Mrs. Van Heysten's tiara,\r\nand Chundermeyer's diamonds, it was a worthless and very indifferent\r\nduplicate!\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNever can I forget the scene in that crowded little room--poor M.\r\nBalabas all anxiety respecting the reputation of his establishment,\r\nand vainly endeavoring to reason with the victims of the amazing Omar\r\nKhân. Finally--\r\n\r\n\"I will search for Inspector Carlisle myself,\" said Mr. Chundermeyer;\r\n\"and if I cannot find him, I shall be compelled to communicate with\r\nthe local police authorities.\"\r\n\r\nM. Balabas still volubly protesting, the unfortunate Veiled Prophet\r\nmade his way from the alcove. I cannot say if the inspiration came as\r\nthe result of a sort of auto-hypnosis induced by staring at the worthless\r\nring in my hand--the stone was not even real lapis-lazuli--but a theory\r\nregarding the manner in which these ingenious substitutions had been\r\neffected suddenly entered my mind.\r\n\r\nThree minutes later I was knocking at the door of Chundermeyer's room.\r\nI received no invitation to enter, and the door was locked. I sought\r\nM. Balabas; and, without confiding to him the theory upon which I was\r\nacting, I urged the desirability of gaining access to the apartment.\r\nAs a result, a master key was procured, and we entered.\r\n\r\nAt the first glance the room seemed to be empty, though it showed\r\nevidence of having recently been occupied, for it was in the utmost\r\ndisorder. Perhaps we should have quitted it unenlightened, if I had\r\nnot detected the sound of a faint groan proceeding from the closed\r\nwardrobe. Stepping across the room, I opened the double doors, and\r\nout into my arms fell a limp figure, bound hand and foot, and having\r\na bath-towel secured tightly around the head to act as a gag. It was\r\nMr. Chundermeyer!\r\n\r\nI think, as I helped to unfasten him, I was the most surprised man in\r\nthe land of Egypt. He was arrayed only in a bath-robe and slippers,\r\nand his bare wrists and ankles were cruelly galled by the cords which\r\nhad bound him. For some minutes he was unable to utter a word, and\r\nwhen at last he achieved speech, his first utterance constituted a\r\nverbal thunderbolt.\r\n\r\n\"I have been robbed!\" he cried huskily. \"I was sand-bagged as I came\r\nfrom my bath, and look--everyone of my cases is gone!\"\r\n\r\nIt was M. Balabas who answered him.\r\n\r\n\"As you returned from your _bath_, Mr. Chundermeyer?\" he said. \"At\r\nwhat time was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"About a quarter-past seven,\" was the amazing reply.\r\n\r\n\"But, good Heaven!\" cried M. Balabas, \"I was speaking to you less than\r\nten minutes ago!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mad!\" groaned Chundermeyer, rubbing his bruised wrists. \"Have\r\nI not been locked in the wardrobe all night!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, merciful saints,\" cried M. Balabas, dramatically raising his\r\nclenched fists to heaven, \"I see it all! You understand, Mr. Kernaby.\r\nIt is _not_ Mr. Chundermeyer with whom we have been conversing, in\r\nwhose hands you have been placing your valuables, it is that devil\r\nincarnate who three years ago impersonated the Emîr al-Hadj, in order\r\nto steal the Holy Carpet; who can impersonate anyone; who, it is said,\r\ncan transform himself at will into an old woman, a camel, or a fig\r\ntree; it is the conjuror, the wizard--Omar of Ispahân!\"\r\n\r\nMy own ideas were almost equally chaotic; for although, as I now\r\nrecalled, I had never throughout the evening obtained a thoroughly\r\ngood view of the features of the Veiled Prophet, I could have sworn\r\nto the voice, to the carriage, to the manner of Mr. Chundermeyer.\r\n\r\nThe puzzling absence of Chief Inspector Carlisle now engaged\r\neverybody's attention; and, acting upon the precedent afforded by the\r\nfinding of Mr. Chundermeyer, we paid a visit to the detective's room.\r\n\r\nInspector Carlisle, fully dressed, and still wearing a soft felt hat,\r\nas though he had but just come in, lay on the floor, unconscious, with\r\nthe greater part of a cigar, which examination showed to be drugged,\r\nclose beside him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs I entered my room that night and switched on the light, in through\r\nthe open window from the balcony stepped Abû Tabâh.\r\n\r\nHis frequent and mysterious appearances in my private apartments did\r\nnot surprise me in the least, and I had even ceased to wonder how he\r\naccomplished them; but--\r\n\r\n\"You are too late, my friend,\" I said. \"Omar of Ispahân has outwitted\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Omar of Ispahân has outwitted men wiser than I,\" he replied gravely;\r\n\"but covetousness is a treacherous master, and I am not without hope\r\nthat we may yet circumvent the father of thieves.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are surely jesting,\" I replied. \"In all probability he is now far\r\nfrom Cairo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I, on the contrary, have reason to believe,\" replied Abû Tabâh\r\ncalmly, \"that he is neither far from Cairo, far from the hotel,\r\nnor far from this very apartment.\"\r\n\r\nHis manner was strange and I discovered excitement to be growing\r\nwithin me.\r\n\r\n\"Accompany me on the balcony,\" he said; \"but first extinguish the\r\nlight.\"\r\n\r\nA moment later I stood looking down upon the moon-bathed gardens,\r\nand Abû Tabâh, beside me, stretched out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"You see the projecting portion of the building yonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied; \"the Harêm Suite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Immediately before the window there is a palm tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have observed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And upon the opposite side of the path there is an acacia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The moon is high, and whilst all the side of the hotel is in shadow\r\nthe acacia is in the moonlight. Its branches would afford concealment,\r\nhowever; and one watching there could see what would be hidden from\r\none on this balcony. I request you, Kernaby Pasha, to approach that\r\n_lebbekh_ tree from the further side of the fountain, in order to\r\nremain invisible from the hotel. Climb to one of the lower branches,\r\nand closely watch four windows.\"\r\n\r\nI stared at him in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Which are the four windows that I am to watch?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are--one, that immediately below your own; two, that to the\r\nright of it; three, the window above the Harêm Suite; and, four,\r\nthe extreme east window of this wing, on the first floor.\"\r\n\r\nNow, my state of mystification grew even denser. For the windows\r\nspecified were, in the order of mention, that of Inspector Carlisle,\r\nwho had not yet recovered consciousness; of Mr. Chundermeyer; of\r\nMajor Redpath, a retired Anglo-Indian who had been confined to his\r\nroom for some time with an attack of malaria; and of M. Balabas,\r\nthe manager.\r\n\r\n\"For what,\" I inquired, \"am I to watch?\"\r\n\r\n\"For a man to descend.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will hold your open watch case where it is clearly visible from\r\nthis spot. Instant upon the man's appearance you will cover it up,\r\nand then uncover it, either once, twice, thrice, or four times.\"\r\n\r\n\"After which?\"\r\n\r\n\"Remain scrupulously concealed. Have the collar of your dinner jacket\r\nturned up in order to betray as little whiteness as possible. Do not\r\ninterfere with the man who descends; but if he enters the Harêm Suite,\r\nsee that he does not come out again! There is no time for further\r\nexplanation, Kernaby Pasha; it is Omar of Ispahân with whom we have\r\nto deal!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nPerched up amid the foliage of the acacia, I commenced that singular\r\nguard imposed upon me by Abû Tabâh. Did he suspect one of these four\r\npersons of being the notorious Omar? Or had his mysterious\r\ninstructions some other significance? The problem defied me; and,\r\nrecognizing that I was hopelessly at sea, I abandoned useless\r\nconjecture and merely watched.\r\n\r\nNor was my vigil a long one. I doubt if I had been at my post for ten\r\nminutes ere a vague figure appeared upon the shadow-veiled balcony of\r\none of the suspected windows--that of Major Redpath, above the Harêm\r\nSuite!\r\n\r\nScarcely daring to credit my eyes, I saw the figure throw down on to\r\nthe projecting top of the _mushrabîyeh_ window below a slender rope\r\nladder. I covered the gleaming gold of my watch-case with my hand, and\r\ngave the signal--_three_.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of phantasy embraced me; and, unmoved to further surprise,\r\nI watched the unknown swarm down the ladder with the agility of an\r\nape. He seemed to wear a robe, surely that of the _Veiled Prophet_!\r\nHe silently manipulated one of the side-panels of the window, opened\r\nit, and vanished within the Harêm Suite.\r\n\r\nRaising my eyes, I beheld a second figure--that of Abû\r\nTabâh--descending a similar ladder to the balcony of Inspector\r\nCarlisle's room. He gained the balcony and entered the room. Four\r\nseconds elapsed; he reappeared, unfurled a greater length of ladder,\r\nand came down to the flower-beds. Lithely as a cat he came to the\r\nprojecting _mushrabîyeh_, swung himself aloft, and as I watched\r\nbreathlessly, expecting him to enter in pursuit of the intruder,\r\nclimbed to the top and began to mount the ladder descending from\r\nMajor Redpath's room!\r\n\r\nHe had just reached the major's balcony, and was stepping through\r\nthe open window, when a most alarming din arose in the Harêm Suite;\r\nevidently a fierce struggle was proceeding in the apartments of the\r\nMudîr's daughter!\r\n\r\nI scrambled down from the acacia and ran to the spot immediately below\r\nthe window, arriving at the very moment that the central lattice was\r\nthrown open, and a white-veiled figure appeared there and prepared to\r\nspring down! Perceiving my approach:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, help me, in the name of Allah!\" cried the woman, in a voice\r\nshrill with fear. \"Quick--catch me!\"\r\n\r\nEre I could frame any reply, she clutched at the palm tree and dropped\r\ndown right into my extended arms, as a crashing of overturned\r\nfurniture came from the room above.\r\n\r\n\"Help them!\" she entreated. \"You are armed, and my women are being\r\nmurdered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Help, Kernaby Pasha!\" now reached my ears, in the unmistakable voice\r\nof Abû Tabâh, from somewhere within. \"See that he does not escape from\r\nthe window!\"\r\n\r\n\"Coming!\" I cried.\r\n\r\nAnd, by means of the palm trunk, I began to mount towards the open\r\nlattice.\r\n\r\nGaining my objective, I stumbled into a room which presented a scene\r\nof the wildest disorder. It was a large apartment, well but sparsely\r\nfurnished in the Eastern manner, and lighted by three hanging lamps.\r\nDirectly under one of these, beside an overturned cabinet of richly\r\ncarven wood inlaid with mother-o'-pearl, lay a Nubian, insensible,\r\nand arrayed only in shirt and trousers. There was no one else in the\r\nroom, and, not pausing to explore those which opened out of it, I ran\r\nand unbolted the heavy door upon which Abû Tabâh was clamoring for\r\nadmittance.\r\n\r\nThe _imám_ leaped into the room, rebolted the door, and glanced to\r\nthe right and left; then he ran into the adjoining apartments, and\r\nfinally, observing the insensible Nubian upon the floor, he stared\r\ninto my face, and I read anger in the eyes that were wont to be so\r\ngentle.\r\n\r\n\"Did I not enjoin you to prevent his escape from the window?\" he\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n\"No one escaped from the window, my friend,\" I retorted, \"except\r\nthe lady who was occupying the suite.\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh fixed his weird eyes upon me in a hypnotic stare of such\r\nuncanny power that I was angrily conscious of much difficulty in\r\nsustaining it; but gradually the quelling look grew less harsh, and\r\nfinally his whole expression softened, and that sweet smile, which\r\ncould so transform his face, disturbed the severity of the set lips.\r\n\r\n\"No man is infallible,\" he said. \"And wiser than you or I have shown\r\nthemselves the veriest fools in contest with Omar Ali Khân. But know,\r\nO Kernaby Pasha, that the lady who occupied this suite secretly left\r\nit at sunset to-night, bearing her jewels with her, and he\"--pointing\r\nto the insensible Nubian on the floor--\"took her place and wore her\r\nraiment----\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the Mudîr's daughter----\"\r\n\r\n\"Is my sister Ayesha!\"\r\n\r\nI looked at him reproachfully, but he met my gaze with calm pride.\r\n\r\n\"Subterfuge was permitted by the Prophet, (on whom be peace),\" he\r\ncontinued; \"but not lying! My sister _is_ the daughter of the Mudîr\r\nel-Fáyûm.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a rebuke, perhaps a merited one; and I accepted it in silence.\r\nAlthough, from the moment that I had first set eyes on him, I had\r\nnever doubted Abû Tabâh to be a man of good family, this modest avowal\r\nwas something of a revelation.\r\n\r\n\"Her presence here, which was permitted by my father,\" he said, \"was a\r\ntrap; for it is well known throughout the Moslem world that she is the\r\npossessor of costly ornaments. The trap succeeded. Omar of Ispahân, at\r\ngreat risk of discovery, remained to steal her jewels, although he had\r\nalready amassed a choice collection.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone had begun to bang upon the bolted door, and there was an\r\nexcited crowd beneath the window.\r\n\r\n\"You supposed, no doubt,\" the _imám_ resumed calmly, \"that I suspected\r\nMajor Redpath and M. Balabas, as well as Mr. Chundermeyer and the\r\nEnglish detective? It was not so. But I regarded the room of M.\r\nBalabas as excellently situated for Omar's purpose, and I knew that M.\r\nBalabas rarely retired earlier than one o'clock. Even more suitable\r\nwas that of Major Redpath, whose illness I believe to have been due to\r\nsome secret art of Omar's.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he is down with chronic malaria!\"\r\n\r\n\"It may even be so; yet I believe the attack to have been induced by\r\nOmar of Ispahân.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, as I learned to-night, Major Redpath is the only person in\r\nCairo who has ever met Mr. Chundermeyer! I will confess that until\r\nless than an hour ago I did not know if Inspector Carlisle was\r\n_really_ an inspector! Oh, it is a seeming absurdity; but Omar of\r\nIspahân is a wizard! Therefore I entered the inspector's room, and\r\nfound him to be still unconscious. Major Redpath was in deep slumber,\r\nand Omar had entered and quitted his room without disturbing him. I\r\ndid likewise, and visited Mr. Chundermeyer's--the door was ajar--on\r\nmy way downstairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my friend,\" I said amazedly, \"with my own eyes I beheld Mr.\r\nChundermeyer gagged and bound in his wardrobe! I saw his bruised\r\nwrists!\"\r\n\r\n\"He gagged, bound, and bruised himself!\" replied Abû Tabâh calmly.\r\n\"With my own eyes I once beheld a blind mendicant hanging by the neck\r\nfrom a fig tree, a bloody froth upon his lips. I cut him down and left\r\nhim for dead. Yet was he neither dead nor a blind mendicant; he was\r\nOmar Ali Khân! Oblige me by opening the door, Kernaby Pasha.\"\r\n\r\nI obeyed, and an excited throng burst in, headed by M. Balabas and\r\nInspector Carlisle, the latter looking very pale and haggard!\r\n\r\n\"Where is the man posing as Chundermeyer?\" began the detective\r\nhoarsely. \"By sheer sleight-of-hand, and under ye're very\r\nnoses\"--excitement rendered him weirdly Caledonian--\"he has robbed\r\nye! I cabled Madras to-day, and the real Chundermeyer arrived at\r\nAmsterdam last Friday! As I returned with the reply cable in my pocket\r\nto-night I became so dizzy I was only just able to get to my room.\r\nHe'd doctored every smoke in my case! Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I assisted him to escape, disguised as a woman, some ten minutes\r\nago,\" I replied feebly. \"I should be sincerely indebted to you if\r\nyou would kick me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Escaped!\" roared Inspector Carlisle. \"Then what are ye doing here?\r\nPursue him, somebody! Are ye all mad?\"\r\n\r\n\"We should be,\" said Abû Tabâh, \"to attempt pursuit. As well pursue\r\nthe shadow of a cloud, the first spear of sunrise, or the phantom\r\nheifer of Pepi-Ankh, as pursue Omar of Ispahân! He is gone--but\r\nempty-handed. Behold what I recovered from 'Mr. Chundermeyer's' room.\"\r\n\r\nFrom beneath his black _gibbeh_ he took out a leather bag, opened it,\r\nand displayed to our startled eyes the tiara of Mrs. Van Heysten, the\r\nrope of pearls, and--my Hatshepsu scarab!\r\n\r\nEre anyone could utter a word, Abû Tabâh inclined his head in\r\ndignified salutation, turned, and walked stately from the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBREATH OF ALLAH\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFor close upon a week I had been haunting the purlieus of the Mûski,\r\nattired as a respectable dragoman, my face and hands reduced to a\r\ndeeper shade of brown by means of a water-color paint (I had to use\r\nsomething that could be washed off and grease-paint is useless for\r\npurposes of actual disguise) and a neat black moustache fixed to my\r\nlip with spirit-gum. In his story _Beyond the Pale_, Rudyard Kipling\r\nhas trounced the man who inquires too deeply into native life; but if\r\neverybody thought with Kipling we should never have had a Lane or a\r\nBurton and I should have continued in unbroken scepticism regarding\r\nthe reality of magic. Whereas, because of the matters which I am about\r\nto set forth, for ten minutes of my life I found myself a trembling\r\nslave of the unknown.\r\n\r\nLet me explain at once that my undignified masquerade was not prompted\r\nby mere curiosity or the quest of the pomegranate, it was undertaken\r\nas the natural sequel to a letter received from Messrs. Moses, Murphy\r\nand Co., the firm which I represented in Egypt, containing curious\r\nmatters affording much food for reflection. \"We would ask you,\" ran\r\nthe communication, \"to renew your inquiries into the particular\r\ncomposition of the perfume 'Breath of Allah,' of which you obtained\r\nus a sample at a cost which we regarded as excessive. It appears to\r\nconsist in the blending of certain obscure essential oils and\r\ngum-resins; and the nature of some of these has defied analysis to\r\ndate. Over a hundred experiments have been made to discover\r\nsubstitutes for the missing essences, but without success; and as\r\nwe are now in a position to arrange for the manufacture of Oriental\r\nperfume on an extensive scale we should be prepared to make it _well\r\nworth your while_ (the last four words characteristically underlined\r\nin red ink) if you could obtain for us a correct copy of the original\r\nprescription.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter went on to say that it was proposed to establish a separate\r\ncompany for the exploitation of the new perfume, with a registered\r\naddress in Cairo and a \"manufactory\" in some suitably inaccessible\r\nspot in the Near East.\r\n\r\nI pondered deeply over these matters. The scheme was a good one and\r\ncould not fail to reap considerable profits; for, given extensive\r\nadvertising, there is always a large and monied public for a new\r\nsmell. The particular blend of liquid fragrance to which the letter\r\nreferred was assured of a good sale at a high price, not alone in\r\nEgypt, but throughout the capitals of the world, provided it could\r\nbe put upon the market; but the proposition of manufacture was beset\r\nwith extraordinary difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe tiny vial which I had despatched to Birmingham nearly twelve\r\nmonths before had cost me close upon £100 to procure, for the reason\r\nthat \"Breath of Allah\" was the secret property of an old and\r\naristocratic Egyptian family whose great wealth and exclusiveness\r\nrendered them unapproachable. By dint of diligent inquiry I had\r\ndiscovered the _attár_ to whom was entrusted certain final processes\r\nin the preparation of the perfume--only to learn that he was ignorant\r\nof its exact composition. But although he had assured me (and I did\r\nnot doubt his word) that not one grain had hitherto passed out of\r\nthe possession of the family, I had succeeded in procuring a small\r\nquantity of the precious fluid.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Moses, Murphy and Co. had made all the necessary arrangements\r\nfor placing it upon the market, only to learn, as this eventful letter\r\nadvised me, that the most skilled chemists whose services were\r\nobtainable had failed to analyse it.\r\n\r\nOne morning, then, in my assumed character, I was proceeding along\r\nthe Shâria el-Hamzâwi seeking for some scheme whereby I might win\r\nthe confidence of Mohammed er-Rahmân the _attár_, or perfumer. I had\r\nquitted the house in the Darb el-Ahmar which was my base of operations\r\nbut a few minutes earlier, and as I approached the corner of the\r\nstreet a voice called from a window directly above my head: \"Saïd!\r\nSaïd!\"\r\n\r\nWithout supposing that the call referred to myself, I glanced up,\r\nand met the gaze of an old Egyptian of respectable appearance who\r\nwas regarding me from above. Shading his eyes with a gnarled hand--\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" he cried, \"it is none other than Saïd the nephew of Yûssuf\r\nKhalig! _Es-selâm 'aleykûm, Saïd!_\"\r\n\r\n\"_Aleykûm, es-selâm_,\" I replied, and stood there looking up at him.\r\n\r\n\"Would you perform a little service for me, Saïd?\" he continued.\r\n\"It will occupy you but an hour and you may earn five piastres.\"\r\n\r\n\"Willingly,\" I replied, not knowing to what the mistake of this\r\nevidently half-blind old man might lead me.\r\n\r\nI entered the door and mounted the stairs to the room in which he\r\nwas, to find that he lay upon a scantily covered _dîwan_ by the open\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\"Praise be to Allah (whose name be exalted)!\" he exclaimed, \"that I am\r\nthus fortunately enabled to fulfil my obligations. I sometimes suffer\r\nfrom an old serpent bite, my son, and this morning it has obliged me\r\nto abstain from all movement. I am called Abdûl the Porter, of whom you\r\nwill have heard your uncle speak; and although I have long retired from\r\nactive labor myself, I contract for the supply of porters and carriers\r\nof all descriptions and for all purposes; conveying fair ladies to the\r\n_hammám_, youth to the bridal, and death to the grave. Now, it was\r\nwritten that you should arrive at this timely hour.\"\r\n\r\nI considered it highly probable that it was also written how I should\r\nshortly depart if this garrulous old man continued to inflict upon me\r\ndetails of his absurd career. However--\r\n\r\n\"I have a contract with the merchant, Mohammed er-Rahmân of the Sûk\r\nel-Attârin,\" he continued, \"which it has always been my custom\r\npersonally to carry out.\"\r\n\r\nThe words almost caused me to catch my breath; and my opinion of Abdul\r\nthe Porter changed extraordinary. Truly my lucky star had guided my\r\nfootsteps that morning!\r\n\r\n\"Do not misunderstand me,\" he added. \"I refer not to the transport of\r\nhis wares to Suez, to Zagazig, to Mecca, to Aleppo, to Baghdad,\r\nDamascus, Kandahar, and Pekin; although the whole of these vast\r\nenterprises is entrusted to none other than the only son of my father:\r\nI speak, now, of the bearing of a small though heavy box from the\r\ngreat magazine and manufactory of Mohammed er-Rahmân at Shubra, to his\r\nshop in the Sûk el-Attârin, a matter which I have arranged for him on\r\nthe eve of the Molid en-Nebi (birthday of the Prophet) for the past\r\nfive-and-thirty years. Every one of my porters to whom I might entrust\r\nthis special charge is otherwise employed; hence my observation that\r\nit was written how none other than yourself should pass beneath this\r\nwindow at a certain fortunate hour.\"\r\n\r\nFortunate indeed had that hour been for me, and my pulse beat far from\r\nnormally as I put the question: \"Why, O Father Abdul, do you attach so\r\nmuch importance to this seemingly trivial matter?\"\r\n\r\nThe face of Abdul the Porter, which resembled that of an intelligent\r\nmule, assumed an expression of low cunning.\r\n\r\n\"The question is well conceived,\" he said, raising a long forefinger\r\nand wagging it at me. \"And who in all Cairo knows so much of the\r\nsecrets of the great as Abdul the Know-all, Abdul the Taciturn! Ask\r\nme of the fabled wealth of Karafa Bey and I will name you every one\r\nof his possessions and entertain you with a calculation of his income,\r\nwhich I have worked out in _nûss-faddah_![B] Ask me of the amber mole\r\nupon the shoulder of the Princess Azîza and I will describe it to you\r\nin such a manner as to ravish your soul! Whisper, my son\"--he bent\r\ntowards me confidentially--\"once a year the merchant Mohammed\r\ner-Rahmân prepares for the Lady Zuleyka a quantity of the perfume\r\nwhich impious tradition has called 'Breath of Allah.' The father of\r\nMohammed er-Rahmân prepared it for the mother of the Lady Zuleyka and\r\nhis father before him for the lady of that day who held the\r\nsecret--the secret which has belonged to the women of this family\r\nsince the reign of the Khalîf el-Hakîm from whose favorite wife they\r\nare descended. To her, the wife of the Khalîf, the first _dirhem_\r\n(drachm) ever distilled of the perfume was presented in a gold vase,\r\ntogether with the manner of its preparation, by the great wizard and\r\nphysician Ibn Sina of Bokhara\" (Avicenna).\r\n\r\n  [B] A _nûss-faddah_ equals a quarter of a farthing.\r\n\r\n\"You are well called Abdul the Know-all!\" I cried in admiration. \"Then\r\nthe secret is held by Mohammed er-Rahmân?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, my son,\" replied Abdul. \"Certain of the essences employed are\r\nbrought, in sealed vessels, from the house of the Lady Zuleyka, as is\r\nalso the brass coffer containing the writing of Ibn Sina; and\r\nthroughout the measuring of the quantities, the secret writing never\r\nleaves her hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, the Lady Zuelyka attends in person?\"\r\n\r\nAbdul the Porter inclined his head serenely.\r\n\r\n\"On the eve of the birthday of the Prophet, the Lady Zuelyka visits\r\nthe shop of Mohammed er-Rahmân, accompanied by an _imám_ from one of\r\nthe great mosques.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why by an _imám_, Father Abdul?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a magical ritual which must be observed in the distillation\r\nof the perfume, and each essence is blessed in the name of one of the\r\nfour archangels; and the whole operation must commence at the hour of\r\nmidnight on the eve of the Molid en-Nebi.\"\r\n\r\nHe peered at me triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" I protested, \"an experienced _attár_ such as Mohammed\r\ner-Rahmân would readily recognize these secret ingredients by their\r\nsmell?\"\r\n\r\n\"A great pan of burning charcoal,\" whispered Abdul dramatically, \"is\r\nplaced upon the floor of the room, and throughout the operation the\r\nattendant _imám_ casts pungent spices upon it, whereby the nature of\r\nthe secret essences is rendered unrecognizable. It is time you depart,\r\nmy son, to the shop of Mohammed, and I will give you a writing making\r\nyou known to him. Your task will be to carry the materials necessary\r\nfor the secret operation (which takes place to-night) from the\r\nmagazine of Mohammed er-Rahmân at Shubra, to his shop in the Sûk\r\nel-Attârin. My eyesight is far from good, Saïd. Do you write as I\r\ndirect and I will place my name to the letter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe words \"well worth your while\" had kept time to my steps, or I\r\ndoubt if I should have survived the odious journey from Shubra. Never\r\ncan I forget the shape, color, and especially the weight, of the\r\nlocked chest which was my burden. Old Mohammed er-Rahmân had accepted\r\nmy service on the strength of the letter signed by Abdul, and of\r\ncourse, had failed to recognize in \"Saïd\" that Hon. Neville Kernaby\r\nwho had certain confidential dealings with him a year before. But\r\nexactly how I was to profit by the fortunate accident which had led\r\nAbdul to mistake me for someone called \"Saïd\" became more and more\r\nobscure as the box grew more and more heavy. So that by the time that\r\nI actually arrived with my burden at the entrance to the Street of the\r\nPerfumers, my heart had hardened towards Abdul the Know-all; and,\r\nsetting my box upon the ground, I seated myself upon it to rest and\r\nto imprecate at leisure that silent cause of my present exhaustion.\r\n\r\nAfter a time my troubled spirit grew calmer, as I sat there inhaling\r\nthe insidious breath of Tonquin musk, the fragrance of attár of roses,\r\nthe sweetness of Indian spikenard and the stinging pungency of myrrh,\r\nopoponax, and ihlang-ylang. Faintly I could detect the perfume which\r\nI have always counted the most exquisite of all save one--that\r\ndelightful preparation of Jasmine peculiarly Egyptian. But the mystic\r\nbreath of frankincense and erotic fumes of ambergris alike left me\r\nunmoved; for amid these odors, through which it has always seemed to\r\nme that that of cedar runs thematically, I sought in vain for any hint\r\nof \"Breath of Allah.\"\r\n\r\nFashionable Europe and America were well represented as usual in the\r\nSûk el-Attârin, but the little shop of Mohammed er-Rahmân was quite\r\ndeserted, although he dealt in the most rare essences of all.\r\nMohammed, however, did not seek Western patronage, nor was there in\r\nthe heart of the little white-bearded merchant any envy of his\r\nseemingly more prosperous neighbors in whose shops New York, London,\r\nand Paris smoked amber-scented cigarettes, and whose wares were\r\ncarried to the uttermost corners of the earth. There is nothing more\r\nillusory than the outward seeming of the Eastern merchant. The\r\nwealthiest man with whom I was acquainted in the Muski had the aspect\r\nof a mendicant; and whilst Mohammed's neighbors sold phials of essence\r\nand tiny boxes of pastilles to the patrons of Messrs. Cook, were not\r\nthe silent caravans following the ancient desert routes laden with\r\ngreat crates of sweet merchandise from the manufactory at Shubra? To\r\nthe city of Mecca alone Mohammed sent annually perfumes to the value\r\nof two thousand pounds sterling; he manufactured three kinds of\r\nincense exclusively for the royal house of Persia; and his wares were\r\nknown from Alexandria to Kashmîr, and prized alike in Stambûl and\r\nTartary. Well might he watch with tolerant smile the more showy\r\nactivities of his less fortunate competitors.\r\n\r\nThe shop of Mohammed er-Rahmân was at the end of the street remote\r\nfrom the Hamzâwi (Cloth Bazaar), and as I stood up to resume my labors\r\nmy mood of gloomy abstraction was changed as much by a certain\r\natmosphere of expectancy--I cannot otherwise describe it--as by the\r\nfamiliar smells of the place. I had taken no more than three paces\r\nonward into the Sûk ere it seemed to me that all business had suddenly\r\nbecome suspended; only the Western element of the throng remained\r\noutside whatever influence had claimed the Orientals. Then presently\r\nthe visitors, also becoming aware of this expectant hush as I had\r\nbecome aware of it, turned almost with one accord, and following the\r\ndirection of the merchants' glances, gazed up the narrow street\r\ntowards the Mosque of el-Ashraf.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must chronicle a curious circumstance. Of the Imám Abû\r\nTabâh I had seen nothing for several weeks, but at this moment I\r\nsuddenly found myself thinking of that remarkable man. Whilst any\r\nmention of his name, or nickname--for I could not believe \"Tabâh\" to\r\nbe patronymic--amongst the natives led only to pious ejaculations\r\nindicative of respectful fear, by the official world he was tacitly\r\ndisowned. Yet I had indisputable evidence to show that few doors in\r\nCairo, or indeed in all Egypt, were closed to him; he came and went\r\nlike a phantom. I should never have been surprised, on entering my\r\nprivate apartments at Shepheard's, to have found him seated therein,\r\nnor did I question the veracity of a native acquaintance who assured\r\nme that he had met the mysterious _imám_ in Aleppo on the same morning\r\nthat a letter from his partner in Cairo had arrived mentioning a visit\r\nby Abû Tabâh to el-Azhar. But throughout the native city he was known\r\nas the Magician and was very generally regarded as a master of the\r\n_ginn_. Once more depositing my burden upon the ground, then, I gazed\r\nwith the rest in the direction of the mosque.\r\n\r\nIt was curious, that moment of perfumed silence, and my imagination,\r\ndoubtless inspired by the memory of Abû Tabâh, was carried back to the\r\ndays of the great _khalîfs_, which never seem far removed from one in\r\nthose mediæval streets. I was transported to the Cairo of Harûn al\r\nRaschîd, and I thought that the Grand Wazîr on some mission from\r\nBaghdad was visiting the Sûk el-Attârin.\r\n\r\nThen, stately through the silent group, came a black-robed,\r\nwhite-turbaned figure outwardly similar to many others in the bazaar,\r\nbut followed by two tall muffled negroes. So still was the place that\r\nI could hear the tap of his ebony stick as he strode along the centre\r\nof the street.\r\n\r\nAt the shop of Mohammed er-Rahmân he paused, exchanging a few words\r\nwith the merchant, then resumed his way, coming down the Sûk towards\r\nme. His glance met mine, as I stood there beside the box; and, to my\r\namazement, he saluted me with smiling dignity and passed on. Had he,\r\ntoo, mistaken me for Saïd--or had his all-seeing gaze detected beneath\r\nmy disguise the features of Neville Kernaby?\r\n\r\nAs he turned out of the narrow street into the Hamzâwi, the commercial\r\nuproar was resumed instantly, so that save for this horrible doubt\r\nwhich had set my heart beating with uncomfortable rapidity, by all the\r\nevidences now about me his coming might have been a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFilled with misgivings, I carried the box along to the shop; but\r\nMohammed er-Rahmân's greeting held no hint of suspicion.\r\n\r\n\"By fleetness of foot thou shalt never win Paradise,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Nor by unseemly haste shall I thrust others from the path,\"\r\nI retorted.\r\n\r\n\"It is idle to bandy words with any acquaintance of Abdul the\r\nPorter's,\" sighed Mohammed; \"well do I know it. Take up the box\r\nand follow me.\"\r\n\r\nWith a key which he carried attached to a chain about his waist,\r\nhe unlocked the ancient door which alone divided his shop from the\r\noutjutting wall marking a bend in the street. A native shop is usually\r\nnothing more than a double cell; but descending three stone steps,\r\nI found myself in one of those cellar-like apartments which are not\r\nuncommon in this part of Cairo. Windows there were none, if I except\r\na small square opening, high up in one of the walls, which evidently\r\ncommunicated with the narrow courtyard separating Mohammed's\r\nestablishment from that of his neighbor, but which admitted scanty\r\nlight and less ventilation. Through this opening I could see what\r\nlooked like the uplifted shafts of a cart. From one of the rough\r\nbeams of the rather lofty ceiling a brass lamp hung by chains, and\r\na quantity of primitive chemical paraphernalia littered the place;\r\nold-fashioned alembics, mysterious looking jars, and a sort of\r\nportable furnace, together with several tripods and a number of large,\r\nflat brass pans gave the place the appearance of some old alchemist's\r\nden. A rather handsome ebony table, intricately carved and inlaid with\r\nmother-o'-pearl and ivory, stood before a cushioned _dîwan_ which\r\noccupied that side of the room in which was the square window.\r\n\r\n\"Set the box upon the floor,\" directed Mohammed, \"but not with such\r\nundue dispatch as to cause thyself to sustain an injury.\"\r\n\r\nThat he had been eagerly awaiting the arrival of the box and was now\r\nburningly anxious to witness my departure, grew more and more apparent\r\nwith every word. Therefore--\r\n\r\n\"There are asses who are fleet of foot,\" I said, leisurely depositing\r\nmy load at his feet; \"but the wise man regulateth his pace in\r\naccordance with three things: the heat of the sun; the welfare of\r\nothers; and the nature of his burden.\"\r\n\r\n\"That thou hast frequently paused on the way from Shubra to reflect\r\nupon these three things,\" replied Mohammed, \"I cannot doubt; depart,\r\ntherefore, and ponder them at leisure, for I perceive that thou art\r\na great philosopher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Philosophy,\" I continued, seating myself upon the box, \"sustaineth\r\nthe mind, but the activity of the mind being dependent upon the\r\nwelfare of the stomach, even the philosopher cannot afford to labor\r\nwithout hire.\"\r\n\r\nAt that, Mohammed er-Rahmân unloosed upon me a long pent-up torrent of\r\ninvective--and furnished me with the information which I was seeking.\r\n\r\n\"O son of a wall-eyed mule!\" he cried, shaking his fists over me, \"no\r\nlonger will I suffer thy idiotic chatter! Return to Abdul the Porter,\r\nwho employed thee, for not one _faddah_ will I give thee, calamitous\r\nmongrel that thou art! Depart! for I was but this moment informed that\r\na lady of high station is about to visit me. Depart! lest she mistake\r\nmy shop for a pigsty.\"\r\n\r\nBut even as he spoke the words, I became aware of a vague disturbance\r\nin the street, and--\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried Mohammed, running to the foot of the steps and gazing\r\nupwards, \"now am I utterly undone! Shame of thy parents that thou\r\nart, it is now unavoidable that the Lady Zuleyka shall find thee\r\nin my shop. Listen, offensive insect--thou art Saïd, my assistant.\r\nUtter not one word; or with this\"--to my great alarm he produced\r\na dangerous-looking pistol from beneath his robe--\"will I blow a\r\nhole through thy vacuous skull!\"\r\n\r\nHastily concealing the pistol, he went hurrying up the steps, in time\r\nto perform a low salutation before a veiled woman who was accompanied\r\nby a Sûdanese servant-girl and a negro. Exchanging some words with her\r\nwhich I was unable to detect, Mohammed er-Rahmân led the way down into\r\nthe apartment wherein I stood, followed by the lady, who in turn was\r\nfollowed by her servant. The negro remained above. Perceiving me as\r\nshe entered, the lady, who was attired with extraordinary elegance,\r\npaused, glancing at Mohammed.\r\n\r\n\"My lady,\" he began immediately, bowing before her, \"it is Saïd my\r\nassistant, the slothfulness of whose habits is only exceeded by the\r\nimpudence of his conversation.\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, bestowing upon me a glance of her beautiful eyes.\r\nDespite the gloom of the place and the _yashmak_ which she wore, it\r\nwas manifest that she was good to look upon. A faint but exquisite\r\nperfume stole to my nostrils, whereby I knew that Mohammed's charming\r\nvisitor was none other than, the Lady Zuleyka.\r\n\r\n\"Yet,\" she said softly, \"he hath the look of an active young man.\"\r\n\r\n\"His activity,\" replied the scent merchant, \"resideth entirely in\r\nhis tongue.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lady Zuleyka seated herself upon the _dîwan_, looking all about\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is in readiness, Mohammed?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Everything, my lady.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the beautiful eyes were turned in my direction, and, as their\r\ninscrutable gaze rested upon me, a scheme--which, since it was never\r\ncarried out, need not be described--presented itself to my mind.\r\nFollowing a brief but eloquent silence--for my answering glances were\r\nladen with significance:--\r\n\r\n\"O Mohammed,\" said the Lady Zuleyka indolently, \"in what manner doth\r\na merchant, such as thyself, chastise his servants when their conduct\r\ndispleaseth him?\"\r\n\r\nMohammed er-Rahmân seemed somewhat at a loss for a reply, and stood\r\nthere staring foolishly.\r\n\r\n\"I have whips for mine,\" murmured the soft voice. \"It is an old custom\r\nof my family.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly she cast her eyes in my direction once more.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to me, O Saïd,\" she continued, gracefully resting one\r\njeweled hand upon the ebony table, \"that thou hadst presumed to cast\r\nlove-glances upon me. There is one waiting above whose duty it is to\r\nprotect me from such insults. Miska!\"--to the servant girl--\"summon\r\nEl-Kimri (The Dove).\"\r\n\r\nWhilst I stood there dumbfounded and abashed the girl called up the\r\nsteps:\r\n\r\n\"El-Kimri! Come hither!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly there burst into the room the form of that hideous negro\r\nwhom I had glimpsed above; and--\r\n\r\n\"O Kimri,\" directed the Lady Zuleyka, and languidly extended her hand\r\nin my direction, \"throw this presumptuous clown into the street!\"\r\n\r\nMy discomfiture had proceeded far enough, and I recognized that, at\r\nwhatever risk of discovery, I must act instantly. Therefore, at the\r\nmoment that El-Kimri reached the foot of the steps, I dashed my left\r\nfist into his grinning face, putting all my weight behind the blow,\r\nwhich I followed up with a short right, utterly outraging the\r\npugilistic proprieties, since it was well below the belt. El-Kimri bit\r\nthe dust to the accompaniment of a human discord composed of three\r\nnotes--and I leaped up the steps, turned to the left, and ran off\r\naround the Mosque of el-Ashraf, where I speedily lost myself in the\r\ncrowded Ghurîya.\r\n\r\nBeneath their factitious duskiness my cheeks were burning hotly: I was\r\nashamed of my execrable artistry. For a druggist's assistant does not\r\nlightly make love to a duchess!\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI spent the remainder of the forenoon at my house in the Darb el-Ahmar\r\nheaping curses upon my own fatuity and upon the venerable head of\r\nAbdul the Know-all. At one moment it seemed to me that I had wantonly\r\ndestroyed a golden opportunity, at the next that the seeming\r\nopportunity had been a mere mirage. With the passing of noon and the\r\napproach of evening I sought desperately for a plan, knowing that if\r\nI failed to conceive one by midnight, another chance of seeing the\r\nfamous prescription would probably not present itself for twelve\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nAt about four o'clock in the afternoon came the dawn of a hazy idea,\r\nand since it necessitated a visit to my rooms at Shepheard's, I washed\r\nthe paint off my face and hands, changed, hurried to the hotel, ate a\r\nhasty meal, and returned to the Darb el-Ahmar, where I resumed my\r\ndisguise.\r\n\r\nThere are some who have criticized me harshly in regard to my\r\ncommercial activities at this time, and none of my affairs has\r\nprovoked greater acerbitude than that of the perfume called \"Breath\r\nof Allah.\" Yet I am at a loss to perceive wherein my perfidy lay; for\r\nmy outlook is sufficiently socialistic to cause me to regard with\r\ndispleasure the conserving by an individual of something which,\r\nwithout loss to himself, might reasonably be shared by the community.\r\nFor this reason I have always resented the way in which the Moslem\r\nveils the faces of the pearls of his _harêm_. And whilst the success\r\nof my present enterprise would not render the Lady Zuleyka the poorer,\r\nit would enrich and beautify the world by delighting the senses of men\r\nwith a perfume more exquisite than any hitherto known.\r\n\r\nSuch were my reflections as I made my way through the dark and\r\ndeserted bazaar quarter, following the Shâria el-Akkadi to the Mosque\r\nof el-Ashraf. There I turned to the left in the direction of the\r\nHamzâwi, until, coming to the narrow alley opening from it into the\r\nSûk el-Attârin, I plunged into its darkness, which was like that of\r\na tunnel, although the upper parts of the houses above were silvered\r\nby the moon.\r\n\r\nI was making for that cramped little courtyard adjoining the shop of\r\nMohammed er-Rahmân in which I had observed the presence of one of\r\nthose narrow high-wheeled carts peculiar to the district, and as the\r\nentrance thereto from the Sûk was closed by a rough wooden fence I\r\nanticipated little difficult in gaining access. Yet there was one\r\ndifficulty which I had not foreseen, and which I had not met with had\r\nI arrived, as I might easily have arranged to do, a little earlier.\r\nComing to the corner of the Street of the Perfumers, I cautiously\r\nprotruded my head in order to survey the prospect.\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh was standing immediately outside the shop of Mohammed\r\ner-Rahmân!\r\n\r\nMy heart gave a great leap as I drew back into the shadow, for I\r\ncounted his presence of evil omen to the success of my enterprise.\r\nThen, a swift revelation, the truth burst in upon my mind. He was\r\nthere in the capacity of _imám_ and attendant magician at the mystical\r\n\"Blessing of the perfumes\"! With cautious tread I retraced my steps,\r\ncircled round the Mosque and made for the narrow street which runs\r\nparallel with that of the Perfumers and into which I knew the\r\ncourtyard beside Mohammed's shop must open. What I did not know was\r\nhow I was going to enter it from that end.\r\n\r\nI experienced unexpected difficulty in locating the place, for the\r\nheight of the buildings about me rendered it impossible to pick up\r\nany familiar landmark. Finally, having twice retraced my steps, I\r\ndetermined that a door of old but strong workmanship set in a high,\r\nthick wall must communicate with the courtyard; for I could see no\r\nother opening to the right, or left through which it would have been\r\npossible for a vehicle to pass.\r\n\r\nMechanically I tried the door, but, as I had anticipated, found it to\r\nbe securely locked. A profound silence reigned all about me and there\r\nwas no window in sight from which my operations could be observed.\r\nTherefore, having planned out my route, I determined to scale the\r\nwall. My first foothold was offered by the heavy wooden lock which\r\nprojected fully six inches from the door. Above it was a crossbeam and\r\nthen a gap of several inches between the top of the gate and the arch\r\ninto which it was built. Above the arch projected an iron rod from\r\nwhich depended a hook; and if I could reach the bar it would be\r\npossible to get astride the wall.\r\n\r\nI reached the bar successfully, and although it proved to be none too\r\nfirmly fastened, I took the chance and without making very much noise\r\nfound myself perched aloft and looking down into the little court. A\r\nsigh of relief escaped me; for the narrow cart with its\r\ndisproportionate wheels stood there as I had seen it in the morning,\r\nits shafts pointing gauntly upward to where the moon of the Prophet's\r\nnativity swam in a cloudless sky. A dim light shone out from the\r\nsquare window of Mohammed er-Rahmân's cellar.\r\n\r\nHaving studied the situation very carefully, I presently perceived to\r\nmy great satisfaction that whilst the tail of the cart was wedged\r\nunder a crossbar, which retained it in its position, one of the\r\nshafts was in reach of my hand. Thereupon I entrusted my weight to the\r\nshaft, swinging out over the well of the courtyard. So successful was\r\nI that only a faint creaking sound resulted; and I descended into the\r\nvehicle almost silently.\r\n\r\nHaving assured myself that my presence was undiscovered by Abû Tabâh,\r\nI stood up cautiously, my hands resting upon the wall, and peered\r\nthrough the little window into the room. Its appearance had changed\r\nsomewhat. The lamp was lighted and shed a weird and subdued\r\nillumination upon a rough table placed almost beneath it. Upon this\r\ntable were scales, measures, curiously shaped flasks, and odd-looking\r\nchemical apparatus which might have been made in the days of Avicenna\r\nhimself. At one end of the table stood an alembic over a little pan in\r\nwhich burnt a spirituous flame. Mohammed er-Rahmân was placing\r\ncushions upon the _dîwan_ immediately beneath me, but there was no one\r\nelse in the room. Glancing upward, I noted that the height of the\r\nneighboring building prevented the moonlight from penetrating into the\r\ncourtyard, so that my presence could not be detected by means of any\r\nlight from without; and, since the whole of the upper part of the room\r\nwas shadowed, I saw little cause for apprehension within.\r\n\r\nAt this moment came the sound of a car approaching along the Shâria\r\nesh-Sharawâni. I heard it stop, near the Mosque of el-Ashraf, and in\r\nthe almost perfect stillness of those tortuous streets from which by\r\nday arises a very babel of tongues I heard approaching footsteps. I\r\ncrouched down in the cart, as the footsteps came nearer, passed the\r\nend of the courtyard abutting on the Street of the Perfumers, and\r\npaused before the shop of Mohammed er-Rahmân. The musical voice of\r\nAbû Tabâh spoke and that of the Lady Zuleyka answered. Came a loud\r\nrapping, and the creak of an opening door: then--\r\n\r\n\"Descend the steps, place the coffer on the table, and then remain\r\nimmediately outside the door,\" continued the imperious voice of the\r\nlady. \"Make sure that there are no eavesdroppers.\"\r\n\r\nFaintly through the little window there reached my ears a sound as of\r\nsome heavy object being placed upon a wooden surface, then a muffled\r\ndisturbance as of several persons entering the room; finally, the\r\nmuffled bang of a door closed and barred ... and soft footsteps in\r\nthe adjoining street!\r\n\r\nCrouching down in the cart and almost holding my breath, I watched\r\nthrough a hole in the side of the ramshackle vehicle that fence to\r\nwhich I have already referred as closing the end of the courtyard\r\nwhich adjoined the Sûk el-Attârin. A spear of moonlight, penetrating\r\nthrough some gap in the surrounding buildings, silvered its extreme\r\nedge. To an accompaniment of much kicking and heavy breathing, into\r\nthis natural limelight arose the black countenance of \"The Dove.\"\r\nTo my unbounded joy I perceived that his nose was lavishly decorated\r\nwith sticking-plaster and that his right eye was temporarily off duty.\r\nEight fat fingers clutching at the top of the woodwork, the bloated\r\nnegro regarded the apparently empty yard for a space of some three\r\nseconds, ere lowering his ungainly bulk to the level of the street\r\nagain. Followed a faint \"pop\" and a gurgling quite unmistakable. I\r\nheard him walking back to the door, as I cautiously stood up and\r\nagain surveyed the interior of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nEgypt, as the earliest historical records show, has always been a land\r\nof magic, and according to native belief it is to-day the theater of\r\nmany super-natural dramas. For my own part, prior to the episode which\r\nI am about to relate, my personal experiences of the kind had been\r\nlimited and unconvincing. That Abû Tabâh possessed a sort of uncanny\r\npower akin to second sight I knew, but I regarded it merely as a form\r\nof telepathy. His presence at the preparation of the secret perfume\r\ndid not surprise me, for a belief in the efficacy of magical\r\noperations prevailed, as I was aware, even among the more cultured\r\nMoslems. My scepticism, however, was about to be rudely shaken.\r\n\r\nAs I raised my head above the ledge of the window and looked into the\r\nroom, I perceived the Lady Zuleyka seated on the cushioned _dîwan_,\r\nher hands resting upon an open roll of parchment which lay upon the\r\ntable beside a massive brass chest of antique native workmanship. The\r\nlid of the chest was raised, and the interior seemed to be empty, but\r\nnear it upon the table I observed a number of gold-stoppered vessels\r\nof Venetian glass and each of which was of a different color.\r\n\r\nBeside a brazier wherein glowed a charcoal fire, Abû Tabâh stood;\r\nand into the fire he cast alternately strips of paper bearing writing\r\nof some sort and little dark brown pastilles which he took from\r\na sandalwood box set upon a sort of tripod beside him. They were\r\ncomposed of some kind of aromatic gum in which benzoin seemed to\r\npredominate, and the fumes from the brazier filled the room with\r\na blue mist.\r\n\r\nThe _imám_, in his soft, musical voice, was reciting that chapter of\r\nthe Korân called \"The Angel.\" The weird ceremony had begun. In order\r\nto achieve my purpose I perceived that I should have to draw myself\r\nright up to the narrow embrasure and rest my weight entirely upon the\r\nledge of the window. There was little danger in the maneuver, provided\r\nI made no noise; for the hanging lamp, by reason of its form, cast no\r\nlight into the upper part of the room. As I achieved the desired\r\nposition I became painfully aware of the pungency of the perfume with\r\nwhich the apartment was filled.\r\n\r\nLying there upon the ledge in a most painful attitude, I wriggled\r\nforward inch by inch further into the room, until I was in a position\r\nto use my right arm more or less freely. The preliminary prayer\r\nconcluded, the measuring of the perfumes had now actually commenced,\r\nand I readily perceived that without recourse to the parchment, from\r\nwhich the Lady Zuleyka never once removed her hands, it would indeed\r\nbe impossible to discover the secret. For, consulting the ancient\r\nprescription, she would select one of the gold-stoppered bottles,\r\nunscrew it, direct that so many grains should be taken from it, and\r\nnever removing her gaze from Mohammed er-Rahmân whilst he measured\r\nout the correct quantity, would restopper the vessel and so proceed.\r\nAs each was placed in a wide-mouthed glass jar by the perfumer, Abû\r\nTabâh, extending his hands over the jar, pronounced the names:\r\n\r\n\"Gabraîl Mikaîl, Israfîl, Israîl.\"\r\n\r\nCautiously I raised to my eyes the small but powerful opera-glasses\r\nto procure which I had gone to my rooms at Shepheard's. Focussing them\r\nupon the ancient scroll lying on the table beneath me, I discovered,\r\nto my joy, that I could read the lettering quite well. Whilst Abû\r\nTabâh began to recite some kind of incantation in the course of which\r\nthe names of the Companions of the Prophet frequently occurred, I\r\ncommenced to read the writing of Avicenna.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful, the High, the\r\nGreat....\"\r\n\r\nSo far had I proceeded and no further when I became aware of a curious\r\nchange in the form of the Arabic letters. They seemed to be moving, to\r\nbe cunningly changing places one with another as if to trick me out of\r\ngrasping their meaning!\r\n\r\nThe illusion persisting, I determined that it was due to the unnatural\r\nstrain imposed upon my vision, and although I recognized that time\r\nwas precious I found myself compelled temporarily to desist, since\r\nnothing was to be gained by watching these letters which danced from\r\nside to side of the parchment, sometimes in groups and sometimes\r\nsingly, so that I found myself pursuing one slim Arab A (_'Alif_)\r\nentirely up the page from the bottom to the top where it finally\r\ndisappeared under the thumb of the Lady Zuleyka!\r\n\r\nLowering the glasses I stared down in stupefaction at Abû Tabâh. He\r\nhad just cast fresh incense upon the flames, and it came home to me,\r\nwith a childish and unreasoning sense of terror, that the Egyptians\r\nwho called this man the Magician were wiser than I. For whilst I could\r\nno longer hear his voice, I now could _see_ the words issuing from his\r\nmouth! They formed slowly and gracefully in the blue clouds of vapour\r\nsome four feet above his head, revealed their meaning to me in letters\r\nof gold, and then faded away towards the ceiling!\r\n\r\nOld-established beliefs began to totter about me as I became aware of\r\na number of small murmuring voices within the room. They were the\r\nvoices of the perfumes burning in the brazier. Said one, in a guttural\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n\"I am Myrrh. My voice is the voice of the Tomb.\"\r\n\r\nAnd another softly: \"I am Ambergris. I lure the hearts of men.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a third huskily: \"I am Patchouli. My promises are lies.\"\r\n\r\nMy sense of smell seemed to have deserted me and to have been\r\nreplaced by a sense of hearing. And now this room of magic began to\r\nexpand before my eyes. The walls receded and receded, until the\r\napartment grew larger than the interior of the Citadel Mosque; the\r\nroof shot up so high that I knew there was no cathedral in the world\r\nhalf so lofty. Abû Tabâh, his hands extended above the brazier, shrank\r\nto minute dimensions, and the Lady Zuleyka, seated beneath me, became\r\nalmost invisible.\r\n\r\nThe project which had led me to thrust myself into the midst of this\r\nfeast of sorcery vanished from my mind. I desired but one thing: to\r\ndepart, ere reason utterly deserted me. But, to my horror, I\r\ndiscovered that my muscles were become rigid bands of iron! The figure\r\nof Abû Tabâh was drawing nearer; his slowly moving arms had grown\r\nserpentine and his eyes had changed to pools of flame which seemed to\r\nsummon me. At the time when this new phenomenon added itself to the\r\nother horrors, I seemed to be impelled by an irresistible force to\r\njerk my head downwards: I heard my neck muscles snap metallically: I\r\n_saw_ a scream of agony spurt forth from my lips ... and I saw upon a\r\nlittle ledge immediately below the square window a little _mibkharah_,\r\nor incense burner, which hitherto I had not observed. A thick, oily\r\nbrown stream of vapor was issuing from its perforated lid and bathing\r\nmy face clammily. Sense of smell I had none; but a chuckling,\r\ndemoniacal voice spoke from the _mibkharah_, saying--\r\n\r\n\"I am _Hashish_! I drive men mad! Whilst thou hast lain up there like\r\na very fool, I have sent my vapors to thy brain and stolen thy senses\r\nfrom thee. It was for this purpose that I was set here beneath the\r\nwindow where thou couldst not fail to enjoy the full benefit of my\r\npoisonous perfume....\"\r\n\r\nSlipping off the ledge, I fell ... and darkness closed about me.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMy awakening constitutes one of the most painful recollections of a\r\nnot uneventful career; for, with aching head and tortured limbs, I sat\r\nupright upon the floor of a tiny, stuffy, and uncleanly cell! The only\r\nlight was that which entered by way of a little grating in the door.\r\nI was a prisoner; and, in the same instant that I realized the fact\r\nof my incarceration, I realized also that I had been duped. The weird\r\nhappenings in the apartment of Mohammed er-Rahmân had been\r\nhallucinations due to my having inhaled the fumes of some preparation\r\nof _hashish_, or Indian hemp. The characteristic sickly odor of the\r\ndrug had been concealed by the pungency of the other and more\r\nodoriferous perfumes; and because of the position of the censer\r\ncontaining the burning _hashish_, no one else in the room had been\r\naffected by its vapor. Could it have been that Abû Tabâh had known\r\nof my presence from the first?\r\n\r\nI rose, unsteadily, and looked out through the grating into a narrow\r\npassage. A native constable stood at one end of it, and beyond him I\r\nobtained a glimpse of the entrance hall. Instantly I recognized that\r\nI was under arrest at the Bâb el-Khalk police station!\r\n\r\nA great rage consumed me. Raising my fists I banged furiously upon\r\nthe door, and the Egyptian policeman came running along the passage.\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean, _shawêsh_?\" I demanded. \"Why am I detained here?\r\nI am an Englishman. Send the superintendent to me instantly.\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman's face expressed alternately anger, surprise, and\r\nstupefaction.\r\n\r\n\"You were brought here last night, most disgustingly and speechlessly\r\ndrunk, in a cart!\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"I demand to see the superintendent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, certainly, _effendim_!\" cried the man, now thoroughly\r\nalarmed. \"In an instant, _effendim_!\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the magical power of the word \"Inglîsi\" (Englishman).\r\n\r\nA painfully perturbed and apologetic native official appeared almost\r\nimmediately, to whom I explained that I had been to a fancy dress ball\r\nat the Gezira Palace Hotel, and, injudiciously walking homeward at a\r\nlate hour, had been attacked and struck senseless. He was anxiously\r\ncourteous, sending a man to Shepheard's with my written instructions\r\nto bring back a change of apparel and offering me every facility for\r\nremoving my disguise and making myself presentable. The fact that he\r\npalpably disbelieved my story did not render his concern one whit the\r\nless.\r\n\r\nI discovered the hour to be close upon noon, and, once more my outward\r\nself, I was about to depart from the Place Bâb el-Khalk, when, into\r\nthe superintendent's room came Abû Tabâh! His handsome ascetic face\r\nexhibited grave concern as he saluted me.\r\n\r\n\"How can I express my sorrow, Kernaby Pasha,\" he said in his soft\r\nfaultless English, \"that so unfortunate and unseemly an accident\r\nshould have befallen you? I learned of your presence here but a few\r\nmoments ago, and I hastened to convey to you an assurance of my\r\ndeepest regret and sympathy.\"\r\n\r\n\"More than good of you,\" I replied. \"I am much indebted.\"\r\n\r\n\"It grieves me,\" he continued suavely, \"to learn that there are\r\nfootpads infesting the Cairo streets, and that an English gentleman\r\nmay not walk home from a ball safely. I trust that you will provide\r\nthe police with a detailed account of any valuables which you may have\r\nlost. I have here\"--thrusting his hand into his robe--\"the only item\r\nof your property thus far recovered. No doubt you are somewhat\r\nshort-sighted, Kernaby Pasha, as I am, and experience a certain\r\ndifficulty in discerning the names of your partners upon your dance\r\nprogramme.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with one of those sweet smiles which could so transfigure his\r\nface, Abû Tabâh handed me my opera-glasses!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE WHISPERING MUMMY\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nFelix Bréton and I were the only occupants of the raised platform\r\nat the end of the hall; and the inartistic performance of the bulky\r\ndancer who occupied the stage promised to be interminable. From\r\nmotives of sheer boredom I studied the details of her dress--a white\r\ndress, fitting like a vest from shoulder to hip, and having short,\r\nfull sleeves under which was a sort of blue gauze. Her hair, wrists,\r\nand ankles glittered with barbaric jewelery and strings of little\r\ncoins.\r\n\r\nA deafening orchestra consisting of tambourines, shrieking Arab viols,\r\nand the inevitable _daràbukeh_, surrounded the performer in a\r\nhalf-circle; and three other large-sized _ghawâzi_ mingled their\r\nshrill voices with the barbaric discords of the musicians. I yawned.\r\n\r\n\"As a quest of local color, Bréton,\" I said, \"this evening's\r\nexpedition can only be voted a dismal failure.\"\r\n\r\nFelix Bréton turned to me, with a smile, resting his elbows upon the\r\ndirty little marble-topped table. He looked sufficiently like an\r\nartist to have been merely a painter; yet his gruesome picture \"Le\r\nRoi S'Amuse\" had proved the salvation of the previous Salon.\r\n\r\n\"Have patience,\" he said; \"it is Shejeret ed-Durr (Tree of Pearls)\r\nthat we have come to see, and she has not yet appeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless she appears shortly,\" I replied, stifling another yawn,\r\n\"I shall disappear.\"\r\n\r\nBut even as I spoke, there arose a hum of excitement throughout\r\nthe crowded room; the fat dancer, breathless from her unpleasing\r\nexertions, resumed her seat; and all the performers turned their\r\nheads towards a door at the side of the stage. A veiled figure\r\nentered, with slow, lithe step; and her appearance was acclaimed\r\nexcitedly. Coming to the centre of the stage, she threw off her\r\nveil with a swift movement, and confronted the audience, a slim,\r\nbarbaric figure. I glanced at Felix Bréton. His eyes were glittering\r\nwith excitement. Here at last was the _ghazîyeh_ of romance, the\r\n_ghazîyeh_ of the Egyptian monuments; a true daughter of that\r\nmysterious tribe who, in the remote past of the Nile-land, wove\r\nspells of subtle moon-magic before the golden Pharaoh.\r\n\r\nA monstrous crash from the musicians opened the music of the\r\ndance--the famous Gazelle dance--which commenced to a measure of\r\nlong, monotonous cadences. Shejeret ed-Durr began slowly to move her\r\narms and body in that indescribable manner which, like the stirring\r\nof palm fronds, speaks the veritable language of the voluptuous Orient.\r\nThe attendant dancers clashing their miniature cymbals, the measure\r\nquickened, and swift passion informed the languorous body, which\r\nmagically became transformed into that of a leaping nymph, a\r\nbacchante, a living illustration of Keats' wonder-words:\r\n\r\n    \"Like to a moving vintage, down they came,\r\n     Crown'd with green leaves, and faces all aflame;\r\n     All madly dancing through the pleasant valley,\r\n         To scare thee, Melancholy!\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of her dance, Shejeret ed-Durr, resuming her veil,\r\ndescended to the floor of the hall and passed from table to table,\r\nexchanging light badinage with those patrons known to her.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you could induce her to come up here, Kernaby?\" said\r\nBréton excitedly; \"she is simply the ideal model for my 'Danse\r\nFunébre.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Any inducement other than our presence in this select part of the\r\nestablishment,\" I replied, offering him a cigarette, \"is unnecessary.\r\nShe will present herself with all reasonable despatch.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, I had seen the dark eyes glance many times towards us, as we\r\nsat there in distinguished isolation; and, even as I spoke, the girl\r\nwas ascending the steps, from whence she approached our table, smiling\r\nin friendly fashion. Bréton's surprise was rather amusing when she\r\nconfidently seated herself, giving an order to the cross-eyed waiter\r\nin close attendance. It would be our privilege, of course, to pay the\r\nbill. Of its being a privilege, no one could doubt who had observed\r\nthe envious glances cast in our direction by less favored patrons.\r\n\r\nAs Bréton spoke no Arabic, the task of interpreter devolved upon me;\r\nand I was carrying on quite mechanically when my attention was drawn\r\nto a peculiarly sinister-looking person seated alone at a table close\r\nbeside the corner of the stage. I remembered having observed him\r\naddress some remark to Shejeret ed-Durr, and having noted that she\r\nseemed to avoid him. Now, he was directing upon us a glare so\r\nelectrically baleful that when I first detected it I was conscious of\r\na sort of shock. The man was rather oddly dressed, wearing a black\r\nturban and a sort of loose robe not unlike the _burnûs_ of the desert\r\nArabs. I concluded that he belonged to some religious order, and that\r\nhis bosom was inflamed with a hatred of a most murderous character\r\ntowards myself, Felix Bréton, and the dancer.\r\n\r\nI endeavored, without attracting the girl's notice to indicate to\r\nBréton the presence of the Man of the Glare; but the artist was so\r\nengrossed in contemplation of Shejeret ed-Durr and kept me so busy\r\ninterpreting, that I abandoned the attempt in despair. Having made his\r\nwishes evident to her, the girl readily consented to pose for him; and\r\nwhen next I glanced at the table near the stage, the Man of the Glare\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhat induced me to look towards the rear of the platform upon which\r\nwe were seated I know not, unless I did so in obedience to a species\r\nof hypnotic suggestion; but something prompted me to glance over my\r\nshoulder. And, for the second time that night, I encountered the gaze\r\nof mysterious eyes. From a little square window these compelling eyes\r\nregarded me fixedly, and presently I distinguished the outline of a\r\nhead surmounted by a white turban.\r\n\r\nThe second watcher was Abû Tabâh!\r\n\r\nWhat business could have brought the mysterious _imám_ to such a place\r\nwas a problem beyond my powers of conjecture, but that he was silently\r\ndirecting me to depart with all speed I presently made out. Having\r\nsignified, by a gesture, that I had grasped the purport of his\r\nmessage, I turned again to Bréton, who was struggling to carry on a\r\nconversation with Shejeret ed-Durr in his native French.\r\n\r\nI experienced some difficulty in inducing him to leave, but my\r\narguments finally prevailed, and we passed out into the dimly lighted\r\nstreet. About us in the darkness pipes wailed, and there was the dim\r\nthrobbing of the eternal _darábukeh_. We were in that part of El-Wasr\r\nadjoining the notorious Square of the Fountain. Discordant woman\r\nvoices filled the night, and strange figures flitted from the shadows\r\ninto the light streaming from the open doorways. It was the centre of\r\nsecret Cairo, the midnight city; and three paces from the door of the\r\ndance hall, a slim, black-robed figure suddenly appeared at my elbow,\r\nand the musical voice of Abû Tabâh spoke close to my ear:\r\n\r\n\"Be on the terrace of Shepheard's in half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe mysterious figure melted again into the shadows about us.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOn the deserted hotel balcony, Abû Tabâh awaited me.\r\n\r\n\"It was indeed fortunate, Kernaby Pasha,\" he said, \"that I observed\r\nyou this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am greatly obliged to you,\" I replied, \"for watching over me with\r\nsuch paternal solicitude. May I inquire what danger I have incurred?\"\r\n\r\nI was angrily conscious of feeling like a schoolboy suffering reproof.\r\n\r\n\"A very great danger,\" Abû Tabâh assured me, his gentle, musical voice\r\nexpressing real concern. \"Ahmad es-Kebîr is the lover of the dancer\r\ncalled Shejeret ed-Durr, although she who is of the _ghawâzi_, of\r\nKeneh does not return his affections.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ahmad es-Kebîr?--do you refer to a malignant looking person in a\r\nblack turban?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh gravely inclined his head.\r\n\r\n\"He is one of the _Rifa'îyeh_, the Black _Darwîshes_. They practise\r\nstrange rites and are by some accredited with supernatural powers. For\r\nyou the danger is not so great as for your friend, who seemed to be\r\nspeaking words of love to the _ghazîyeh_.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed shortly.\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken, Abû Tabâh,\" I replied; \"his interest was not of the\r\ncharacter which you suppose. He is an artist and merely desired the\r\ngirl to pose for him.\"\r\n\r\nAbû Tabâh shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"She is an unveiled woman,\" he said contemptuously, \"but love in the\r\nheart of such a one as Ahmad is a terrible passion, consuming the\r\nvitals and rendering whom it afflicts either a partaker of Paradise\r\nor as one of the evil _ginn_.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the particular case under consideration,\" I said, \"it would seem\r\ndistinctly to have produced the latter and less agreeable symptoms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let your friend step warily,\" advised Abû Tabâh; \"for some who have\r\naroused the enmity of the Black _Darwîshes_ have met with strange\r\nends, nor has it been possible to fix responsibility upon any member\r\nof the order.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think my poor friend, Felix Bréton, may be discovered some\r\nmorning in an unpleasantly messy condition?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Black _Darwîshes_ do not employ the knife,\" answered Abû Tabâh;\r\n\"they employ strange and more subtle weapons.\"\r\n\r\nI stared hard at him in the darkness. I thought I knew my Cairo, but\r\nthis sounded unpleasantly mysterious. However--\r\n\r\n\"I am indebted to you, Abû Tabâh,\" I said, \"for your timely warning.\r\nAs you know, I always personally avoid any possibility of\r\nmisunderstanding in regard to my relations with Egyptian womenfolk.\"\r\n\r\n\"With some rare exceptions,\" agreed Abû Tabâh, \"particulars of which\r\nescape my memory at the moment, you have always been a model of\r\ndiscretion, Kernaby Pasha.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will warn my friend,\" I said hastily, \"of the view of his conduct\r\nmistakenly taken by the gentleman in the black turban.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well,\" replied Abû Tabâh; \"we shall meet again ere long.\"\r\n\r\nWith that and the customary dignified salutations he departed, leaving\r\nme wondering what hidden significance lay in his words, \"we shall meet\r\nagain ere long.\"\r\n\r\nExperience had taught me that Abû Tabâh's warnings were not to be\r\nlightly dismissed, and I knew enough of the fanaticism of those\r\nstrange Eastern sects whereof the _Rifa'îyeh_, or Black _Darwîshes_,\r\nwas one, to realize that it would prove an unhealthy amusement to\r\ninterfere with their domestic affairs. Felix Bréton, who possessed the\r\nrare gift of capturing and transferring to canvas the atmosphere of\r\nthe East with the opulent colorings and vivid contrasts which\r\nconstitute its charm, had nevertheless but little practical experience\r\nof the manners and customs of the golden Orient. He had leased a large\r\nstudio situated on the roof of a fine old Cairene palace hidden away\r\nbehind the Street of the Booksellers and almost in the shadow of the\r\nMosque of el-Azhar. His romantic spirit had prompted him after a time\r\nto give up his rooms at the Continental and to take up his abode in\r\nthe apartment adjoining the studio; that is to say, completely to cut\r\nhimself off from European life and to become an inhabitant of the\r\nOriental city. With his imperfect knowledge of the practical side of\r\nnative life in the East, I did not envy him; but I was fully alive to\r\nhis danger, isolated as he was from the European community, indeed\r\nfrom modernity; for out of the boulevards of modern Cairo into the\r\nstreets of the _Arabian Nights_ is but a step, yet a step that bridges\r\nthe gulf of centuries.\r\n\r\nAs I entered his studio on the following morning, I discovered him at\r\nwork upon the extraordinary picture \"Danse Funébre.\" Shejeret ed-Durr\r\nwas posing in the dress of an ancient priestess of Isis. Bréton\r\nbriefly greeted me, waving his hand towards a cushioned _dîwan_ before\r\nwhich stood a little coffee-table bearing decanters, siphons,\r\ncigarettes, and other companionable paraphernalia. Making myself\r\ncomfortable, I studied the picture and the model.\r\n\r\n\"Danse Funébre\" was an extraordinary conception, representing an\r\nelaborately furnished modern room, apparently that of an antiquary\r\nor Egyptologist; for a multitude of queer relics decorated the walls,\r\ncabinets, and the large table at which a man was seated. Boldly\r\nrepresented immediately to the left of his chair stood a mummy in an\r\nornate sarcophagus, and forth from the swathed figure into the light\r\ncast downwards from an antique lamp, floated a beautiful spirit\r\nshape--that of an Egyptian priestess. Upon her face was an expression\r\nof intense anger, as, her fingers crooked in sinister fashion, she\r\nbent over the man at the table.\r\n\r\nThe mummy and sarcophagus depicted on the canvas stood before me\r\nagainst the wall of the studio, the lid resting beside the case. It\r\nwas moulded, as is sometimes seen, to represent the face and figure of\r\nthe occupant and was as fine an example of the kind as I had met with.\r\nThe mummy was that of a priestess and dancer of the Great Temple at\r\nPhilæ, and it had been lent by the museum authorities for the purpose\r\nof Bréton's picture.\r\n\r\nHis enthusiasm at first seeing Shejeret ed-Durr was explainable by the\r\nreally uncanny resemblance which the girl bore to the modeled figure.\r\nStudying her, from my seat on the _dîwan_, as she posed in that gauzy\r\nraiment depicted upon the lid of the sarcophagus, it seemed indeed\r\nthat the ancient priestess was reborn in the form of Shejeret ed-Durr\r\nthe _ghazîyeh_. Bréton had evidently tabooed make-up, with the\r\nexception of the characteristic black bordering to the eyes (which\r\nappeared in the presentment of the servant of Isis); and seen now in\r\nits natural coloring the face of the dancing-girl had undoubted\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nPresently, whilst the model rested, I informed Bréton of my\r\nconversation with Abû Tabâh; but, as I had anticipated, he was\r\nsceptical to the point of derision.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Kernaby,\" he said, \"is it likely that I am going to interrupt\r\nmy work now that I have found such an inspiring model, because some\r\nridiculous _darwîsh_ disapproves?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is highly unlikely,\" I admitted; \"but do not make the mistake of\r\ntreating the matter lightly. You are right off the map here, and Cairo\r\nis not Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a great deal safer!\" he cried in his boisterous fashion, \"and\r\ninfinitely more interesting.\"\r\n\r\nBut my mind was far from easy; for in the dark eyes of the model, when\r\ntheir glance rested upon Felix Bréton, there was that to have aroused\r\npoisonous sentiments in the bosom of the Man of the Glare.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the following month I saw Felix Bréton two or\r\nthree times, and he was enthusiastic about the progress of his picture\r\nand the beauty of his model. The first hint that I received of the\r\nstrange idea which was to lead to stranger happenings came one\r\nafternoon when he had called upon me at Shepheard's.\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe in reincarnation, Kernaby?\" he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nI stared at him in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Regardless of my personal views on the matter,\" I replied, \"in what\r\nway does the subject interest you?\"\r\n\r\nMomentarily he hesitated; then--\r\n\r\n\"The resemblance between Yâsmîna\" (this was the real name of Shejeret\r\ned-Durr) \"and the priestess of Isis,\" he said, \"appears to me too\r\nmarked to be explainable by mere coincidence. If the mummy were my\r\npersonal property I should unwrap it----\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you seriously desire me to believe that you regard Yâsmîna as a\r\nreincarnation of the elder lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"That or a lineal descendant,\" he answered. \"The tribe of the\r\n_Ghawâzi_ is of unknown antiquity and may very well be descended from\r\nthose temple dancers of the days of the Pharaohs. If you have studied\r\nthe ancient wall paintings, you cannot have failed to observe that the\r\ndancing girls represented have entirely different forms from those of\r\nany other women depicted and from those of the ordinary Egyptian women\r\nof to-day.\"\r\n\r\nHis enthusiasm was tremendous; he was one of those uncomfortable\r\nfanatics who will ride a theory to the death.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say that I have noticed it,\" I replied. \"Your knowledge\r\nof the female form divine is doubtless more extensive than mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Kernaby,\" he cried excitedly, \"to the trained eye the\r\ndifference is extraordinary. Until I saw Yâsmîna I had believed the\r\npeculiar form to which I refer to be extinct like the blue enamel and\r\nthe sacred lotus. If it is not reincarnation it is heredity.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help thinking that it more closely resembled insanity than\r\neither; but since Bréton had made no reference to the wearer of the\r\nblack turban, I experienced less anxiety respecting his physical than\r\nhis mental welfare.\r\n\r\nThree days later there was a dramatic development. Drifting idly into\r\nBréton's studio one morning I found him pacing the place in despair\r\nand glaring at his unfinished canvas like a man distraught.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Shejeret ed-Durr?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Gone!\" he replied. \"She disappeared yesterday and I can find no trace\r\nof her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely the excellent Suleyman, proprietor of the dancing\r\nestablishment, can assist you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you,\" cried Bréton savagely, \"that she has disappeared. No one\r\nknows what has become of her.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at him in dismay. He presented a mournful spectacle. He was\r\nunshaven and his dark hair was wildly disordered. His despair was more\r\nacute than I should have supposed possible in the circumstances; and\r\nI concluded that his interest in Yâsmîna was deeper than I had assumed\r\nor that I was incapable of comprehending the artistic temperament. I\r\nsuppose the Gallic blood in him had something to do with it, but I was\r\nunspeakably distressed to observe that the man was on the verge of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nConsolation was impossible, and I left him pacing his empty studio\r\ndistractedly. That night at an unearthly hour, long after I had\r\nretired to my own apartments, he came to Shepheard's. Being shown into\r\nmy room, and the servant having departed--\r\n\r\n\"Yâsmîna is dead!\" he burst out, standing there, a disheveled figure,\r\njust within the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I exclaimed, standing up from the table at which I had been\r\nwriting and confronting him. \"Dead? Do you mean----\"\r\n\r\n\"He has murdered her!\" said Bréton, in a dull monotonous voice--\"that\r\nfiend of whom you warned me.\"\r\n\r\nI was appalled; for I had been utterly unprepared for such a tragedy.\r\n\r\n\"Who discovered her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one discovered her; she will never be discovered! He has buried\r\nher body in some secret spot in the desert.\"\r\n\r\nMy amazement grew with every word that he uttered, and presently--\r\n\r\n\"Then how in Heaven's name did you learn of her murder?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nFelix Bréton, who had begun to pace up and down the room, a truly\r\npitiable figure, paused and looked at me wildly.\r\n\r\n\"You will think that I am mad, Kernaby,\" he said; \"but I must tell\r\nyou--I must tell someone. I could see that you were incredulous when\r\nI spoke to you of reincarnation, but I was right, Kernaby, I was right!\r\nEither that or my reason is deserting me.\"\r\n\r\nMy opinion inclined distinctly in the direction of the latter theory,\r\nbut I remained silent, watching Bréton's haggard face.\r\n\r\n\"To-night,\" he continued, \"as I sat looking at my unfinished picture\r\nand trying to imagine what could have become of Yâsmîna, the\r\nmummy--the mummy of the priestess--_spoke to me_!\"\r\n\r\nI slowly sank back into my chair. I was now assured that Felix Bréton\r\nhad formed a sudden and intense infatuation for Yâsmîna and that her\r\nmysterious disappearance had deranged his sensitive mind. Words failed\r\nme; I could think of nothing to say; and bending towards me his\r\nhaggard face--\r\n\r\n\"It whispered to me,\" he said, \"in _her_ voice--in my own language,\r\nFrench, as I have taught it to her; just a few imperfect words, but\r\nsufficient to convey to me the story of the tragedy. Kernaby, what\r\ndoes it mean? Is it possible that her spirit, released from the body\r\nof Yâsmîna, has returned to that which I firmly believe it formerly\r\ninhabited?...\"\r\n\r\nI had had the misfortune to be a party to some distressing scenes, but\r\nfew had affected me so unpleasantly as this. That poor Felix Bréton\r\nwas raving I could not doubt, but having persuaded him to spend the\r\nnight at Shepheard's and having seen him safely to bed, I returned to\r\nmy own room to endeavor to work out the problem of what steps I should\r\ntake regarding him on the morrow.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, however, he seemed more composed, having shaved and\r\ngenerally rendered himself more presentable; but the wild look still\r\nlingered in his eyes and I could see that the strange obsession had\r\nsecured a firm hold upon him. He discussed the matter quite calmly\r\nduring breakfast, and invited me to visit the scene of this\r\nsupernatural happening. I assented, and hailing _arabîyeh_ we drove\r\ntogether to the studio.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing abnormal in the appearance of the place, but I\r\nexamined the mummy and the mummy case with a new curiosity; for if\r\nFelix Bréton was not mad (and this was a point upon which I recognized\r\nmy incompetence to decide) the phantom voice was clearly the product\r\nof some trick. However, I was unable to discover anything to account\r\nfor it. The sarcophagus stood against the outer wall of the studio and\r\nnear to a large lattice window before which was draped a heavy\r\ntapestry curtain for the purpose of excluding undesirable light upon\r\nthat side of the model's throne. There was no balcony outside the\r\nwindow, which was fully, thirty feet from the street below; therefore\r\nunless someone had been hiding in the window recess beside the\r\nsarcophagus, trickery appeared to be out of the question. Turning to\r\nBréton, who was watching me haggardly--\r\n\r\n\"You searched the recess last night?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I did--immediately. There was no one there. There was no one anywhere\r\nin the studio; and when I looked out of the open window, the street\r\nbelow was deserted from end to end.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, I took it for granted that he would avoid the place, at any\r\nrate by night; and I said as much, as we passed along the Mûski\r\ntogether. I can never forget the wildness in his eyes as he turned to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"I _must_ go back, Kernaby,\" he said. \"It seems like desertion, base\r\nand cowardly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBréton did not join me at dinner that evening as we had arranged that\r\nhe should do, and towards the hour of ten o'clock, growing more and\r\nmore uneasy on his behalf, I set out for the studio, half hoping that\r\nI should meet him. I saw nothing of him, however, as I crossed the\r\nEzbekîyeh Gardens and the Atabet el-Khadrâ into the Mûski. From thence\r\nonward to the Rondpoint the dark and narrow streets were almost\r\ndeserted, and from the corner of the Shâria el-Khordâgîya to the\r\nStreet of the Bookbinders I met with no living thing save a lean and\r\nfurtive cat.\r\n\r\nMy footsteps echoed hollowly from wall to wall of the overhanging\r\nbuildings, as I approached the door giving access to the courtyard\r\nfrom which a stair communicated with the studio above. The moonlight,\r\nslanting down into the ancient place, left more than half of it in\r\ndensest shadow, but just touched the railing of the balcony and the\r\nlower part of the _mushrabîyeh_ screen masking what once had been the\r\n_harêm_ apartments from the view of one entering the courtyard. Far\r\nabove me, through an open lattice, a dim light shone out, though\r\nvaguely. This part of the house was bathed in the radiance of the\r\nmoon, which dimmed that of the studio lamp; for the open window was\r\nthe window of Bréton's studio.\r\n\r\nThe door at the foot of the stairs was partly open, and I ascended\r\nslowly, since the place was quite dark and I was forced to feel my way\r\naround the eccentric turnings introduced by an Arab architect to whom\r\nsimplicity had evidently been an abomination.\r\n\r\nA modern door had been fitted to the studio; and although this door\r\nwas also unfastened, I rapped loudly, but, receiving no answer,\r\nentered the studio. It was empty. The lamp was lighted, as I had\r\nobserved from below, and a faint aroma of Turkish tobacco smoke hung\r\nin the air. Clearly, Bréton had left but a few moments earlier; and\r\nI judged it probable that he would be returning very shortly, for had\r\nhe set out for Shepheard's he would not have left his door unlocked,\r\nand in any event I should have met him on the way. Therefore, having\r\nglanced into the inner room, which, latterly, Bréton had been using as\r\na bedroom, I sat down on the _dîwan_ and prepared to await his return.\r\n\r\nThe lamp whose light I had seen shining through the window was that\r\nwhich hung before the model's throne, and the curtain which usually\r\ndraped the window recess had been partially pulled aside, so that from\r\nwhere I sat I could see part of the centre lattice, which was open.\r\nMy mind at this time was entirely occupied with uneasy speculations\r\nregarding Bréton, and although I had glanced more than once at the\r\nlarge unfinished picture on the easel, from which the face of Shejeret\r\ned-Durr peered out across the shoulder of the seated man, and several\r\ntimes had looked at the mummy set upright in its painted sarcophagus,\r\nno sense of the uncanny had touched me or in any way prepared me for\r\nthe amazing manifestation which I was about to witness.\r\n\r\nHow long I had sat there I cannot say exactly; possibly for ten\r\nminutes or a quarter of an hour: when, suddenly, an eerie whisper\r\ncrept through the stillness of the big room!\r\n\r\nSince I had more than once been temporarily tricked into belief in the\r\nsupernatural, by means of certain ingenious devices, I did not readily\r\nfall a victim to the mysterious nature of the present occurrence. Yet\r\nI must confess that my heart gave a great leap and I was forced to\r\nexert all my will to control my nerves. I sat quite still, listening\r\nintently for a repetition of that evil whisper. Then, in the\r\nstillness, it came again.\r\n\r\n\"Felix,\" it breathed, \"because of you I lie dead in a grave in the\r\ndesert.... I died for you, Felix, and now I am so lonely....\"\r\n\r\nThe whispering voice offered no clue to the age or the sex of the\r\nspeaker; for a true whisper is toneless. But the words, as Bréton had\r\ndeclared, were uttered in broken French and spoken with a curious\r\naccent.\r\n\r\nIt ceased, that ghostly whispering; and I realized that my nerves\r\ncould stand no more of it; for that it came or seemed to come from the\r\nmummy of the priestess was a fact as undeniable as it was horrible.\r\n\r\nResorting to action, I sprang up and leaped across the room, grasping\r\nfirst at the curtain draped in the window on the right of the\r\nsarcophagus. I jerked it fully aside. The recess was empty. All three\r\nlattices were open, on the right, left, and in the centre of the\r\nwindow; but, craning out from the latter, I saw the street below to\r\nbe vacant from end to end.\r\n\r\nStepping back into the room, and metaphorically clutching my courage\r\nwith both hands, I approached the sarcophagus, peered behind it, all\r\naround it, and, finally, into the swathed face of the mummy itself.\r\nNothing rewarded my search. But the studio of Felix Bréton seemed to\r\nhave become icily cold; at any rate I found myself to be shivering;\r\nand walking deliberately, although it cost me a monstrous effort to do\r\nso, I descended the dark winding stairway into the courtyard, and, on\r\nregaining the street, discovered to my intense annoyance that my brow\r\nwas wet with cold perspiration.\r\n\r\nI had taken no more than ten paces in the direction of the Sûk\r\nes-Sûdan when I heard the sound of approaching footsteps, and for some\r\nreason (I can only suppose as a result of my highly strung condition)\r\nI stepped into the shelter of a narrow gateway, where I could see\r\nwithout being seen, and there awaited the appearance of the one who\r\napproached.\r\n\r\nIt was Felix Bréton, his face showing ghastly in the moonlight as he\r\nturned the corner. I could not be certain if a mere echo had deceived\r\nme, but I thought I could detect faintly the softer footfalls of\r\nsomeone who was following him. From my cover I had an uninterrupted\r\nview of the entrance to the house which I had just left; and without\r\nshowing myself I watched Bréton approach the door. At its threshold\r\nhe seemed to hesitate; and in that brief hesitancy were illustrated\r\nthe conflicting emotions driving the man. I recalled the words he had\r\nspoken to me that morning. \"I must go back, Kernaby; it seems like\r\ndesertion, base and cowardly.\" He opened the door and disappeared.\r\n\r\nAs he did so, a second figure crossed from the shadows on the opposite\r\nside of the street--that is, the side upon which I was concealed; and\r\nin turn advanced towards the door. As he passed my hiding-place I\r\nacted. Without an instant's hesitation I hurled myself upon him.\r\n\r\nHow he avoided that furious attack--if he did avoid it--or whether in\r\nthe darkness I miscalculated my spring, I do not know to this day: I\r\nonly know that I missed my objective, stumbled, recovered myself ...\r\nand turned with clenched fists to find _Abû Tabâh_ confronting me!\r\n\r\n\"Kernaby Pasha!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Abû Tabâh!\" said I dazedly.\r\n\r\n\"I perceive that I am not alone in my anxiety for the welfare of M.\r\nFelix Bréton.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why were you following him? I narrowly missed assaulting you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very narrowly,\" he agreed in his gentle manner; \"but you ask me why\r\nI was following M. Bréton. I was following him because I have seen so\r\nmany of those who have crossed the path of the Black _Darwîshes_ meet\r\nwith violent and inexplicable deaths.\"\r\n\r\n\"Murder?\" I whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Not murder--suicide. Therefore, observing, as I had anticipated,\r\na strangeness in your friend's behavior, I have watched him.\"\r\n\r\n\"The strangeness of his behavior is easily accounted for,\" I said.\r\nAnd excitedly, for the horror of the episode in the studio was still\r\nstrongly upon me, I told him of the whispering mummy.\r\n\r\n\"These are very dreadful things of which you speak, Kernaby Pasha,\" he\r\nadmitted, \"but I warned you that it was ill to incur the enmity of the\r\nBlack _Darwîshes_. That there is a scheme afoot to compass the\r\nself-destruction or insanity of your friend is now evident to me; and\r\nhe has brought this calamity upon himself; for the words which he\r\nbelieved to be spoken by the spirit of the girl Yâsmîna would not have\r\naffected him so unpleasantly if his attitude towards her had been\r\nmarked by proper restraint and the affair confined within suitable\r\nlimitations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. But although the Black _Darwîshes_ may be both malignant\r\nand clever, that uncanny whispering is beyond the control of natural\r\nforces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such is not my opinion,\" replied Abû Tabâh. \"A spirit does not\r\nmistake one person for another; and the whispering voice addressed\r\nitself to 'Felix' when Felix was not present. I believe, Kernaby\r\nPasha, that you are the possessor of a pair of excellent\r\nopera-glasses? May I suggest that you return to Shepheard's and\r\nprocure them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe platform of the minaret seemed very cold to the touch of my\r\nstockinged feet; for I had left my shoes at the entrance to the mosque\r\nbelow in accordance with custom; and now, from the wooden balcony, I\r\noverlooked the neighboring roofs of Cairo, and Abû Tabâh, beside me,\r\npointed to where a vague patch of light broke the darkness beneath us\r\nto the left.\r\n\r\n\"The window of M. Felix Bréton's studio,\" he said.\r\n\r\nRaising the glasses to his eyes, he gazed in that direction, whilst\r\nI also peered thither and succeeded in making out the well of the\r\ncourtyard and the roofs of the buildings to right and left of it.\r\nIt was not evident to me for what Abû Tabâh was looking, and when\r\npresently he lowered the glasses and turned to me I expressed my\r\ndoubts in words.\r\n\r\n\"It is surely evident,\" I said, speaking, as I now almost invariably\r\ndid to the _imám_, in English, of which he had a perfect mastery,\r\n\"that we have little chance of discovering anything from here, since\r\nnothing was visible from the studio window. Furthermore, who save\r\nYâsmîna could have spoken in the manner which I have related and in\r\nbroken French?\"\r\n\r\n\"An eavesdropper,\" he replied, \"might have profited by the lessons\r\nwhich Yâsmîna received from M. Bréton; and all vocal characteristics\r\nare lost in a whisper. In the second place, Yâsmîna is not dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I cried.\r\n\r\nAlthough, when Bréton had informed me of her death, I myself had\r\ndoubted him, for some reason the ghostly whisper had convinced me as\r\nit had convinced him.\r\n\r\n\"She has been kept a prisoner during the past week in a house\r\nbelonging to one of the Black _Darwîshes_,\" continued Abû Tabâh; \"but\r\nmy agents succeeded in tracing her this morning. By my orders,\r\nhowever, she has not been allowed to return to her home.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was the object of those orders?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I might learn for what purpose she had been made to disappear,\"\r\nreplied Abû Tabâh; \"and I have learned it to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you think that the whispering mummy----\"\r\n\r\nHe suddenly clutched my arm.\r\n\r\n\"Quick! raise your glasses!\" he said softly. \"On the roof of the house\r\nto the left of the light. There is the whispering mummy!\"\r\n\r\nStrung up to a high pitch of excitement, I gazed through the glasses\r\nin the direction indicated by my companion. Without difficulty I\r\ndiscerned him--a man wearing a black turban--who crept like some\r\nungainly cat along the flat roof, carrying in his hand what looked\r\nlike one of those sugar canes which pass for a delicacy among the\r\nnatives, but which to European eyes appear more suitable for\r\ncurtain-poles than sweetmeats. Springing perilously across a yawning\r\ngulf, the wearer of the black turban gained the roof of the studio,\r\ncrept along for some little distance further, and then, lying prone,\r\nbegan slowly to lower the bamboo rod in the direction of the lighted\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nI found that unconsciously I had suspended my respiration, and now,\r\nbreathlessly, as the truth came home to me--\r\n\r\n\"It is a speaking-tube!\" I cried, \"I cannot see the end of it, but no\r\ndoubt it is curved so as to protrude through the side of the lattice\r\nwindow. Do you look, Abû Tabâh: _I_ propose to act.\"\r\n\r\nThrusting the glasses into the _imám's_ hand, I took my Colt repeater\r\nfrom my pocket, and, having peered for some seconds steadily in the\r\ndirection of the dimly visible _Darwîsh_, I opened fire! I had fired\r\nfive shots in the heat of my anger at that sinister crouching figure,\r\nere Abû Tabâh seized my wrist.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" he cried; \"do you forget where you stand?\"\r\n\r\nTruly I had forgotten in my indignation, or I should not have outraged\r\nhis feelings by firing from the minaret of a mosque. But sufficient of\r\nmy wrath remained to occasion me a thrill of satisfaction, when,\r\npeering through the dusk, I saw the _Darwîsh_ throw up his arms and\r\ndisappear from view.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"There is blood in the courtyard,\" said Abû Tabâh; \"but Ahmad es-Kebîr\r\nhas fled. Therefore he still lives, and his anger will be not the less\r\nbut the greater. Depart from Cairo, M. Bréton: it is my counsel to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" cried Felix Bréton, glaring wildly at the big canvas on the\r\neasel, \"I must finish my picture. As Yâsmîna is alive, she must\r\nreturn, and I must finish my picture!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yâsmîna cannot return,\" replied Abû Tabâh, fixing his weird eyes upon\r\nthe speaker. \"I have caused her to be banished from Cairo.\" He raised\r\nhis hand, checking Bréton's hot words ere they were uttered.\r\n\"Recriminations are unavailing. Her presence disturbs the peace of the\r\ncity, and the peace of the city it is my duty to maintain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nOTHER TALES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nLORD OF THE JACKALS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those days, of course (said the French agent, looking out across\r\nthe sea of Yûssuf Effendis which billowed up against the balcony to\r\nwhere, in the moonlight, the minarets of Cairo pointed the way to\r\nGod), I did not occupy the position which I occupy to-day. No, I was\r\nyounger, and more ambitious; I thought to carve in the annals of Egypt\r\na name for myself such as that of De Lesseps.\r\n\r\nI had a scheme--and there were those who believed in it--for extending\r\nthe borders of Egypt. Ah! my friends, Egypt after all is but a double\r\nbelt of mud following the Nile, and terminated east and west by the\r\ndesert. The desert! It was the dream of my life to exterminate that\r\ndesert, that hungry gray desert; it was my plan--a foolish plan as I\r\nknow now--to link the fertile Fáyûm to the Oases! How was this to be\r\ndone? Ah!\r\n\r\nWhy should I dig up those buried skeletons? It was not done; it never\r\ncould be done; therefore, let me not bore you with how I had proposed\r\nto do it. Suffice it that my ambitions took me far off the beaten\r\ntracks, far, even, from the caravan roads--far into the gray heart of\r\nthe desert.\r\n\r\nBut I was ambitious, and only nineteen--or scarcely twenty. At\r\nnineteen, a man who comes from St. Rémy fears no obstacle which Fate\r\ncan place in his way, and looks upon the world as a grape-fruit to be\r\nsweetened with endeavor and sucked empty.\r\n\r\nIt was in those days, then, that I learned as your Rudyard Kipling has\r\nalso learned that \"East is East\"; it was in those days that I came\r\nface to face with that \"mystery of Egypt\" about which so much is\r\nwritten, has always been written, and always will be written, but\r\nconcerning which so few people, so very few people, know anything\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nYes, I, René de Flassans, saw with my own eyes a thing that I knew to\r\nbe magic, a thing whereat my reason rebelled--a thing which my poor\r\nEuropean intelligence could not grapple, could not begin to explain.\r\n\r\nIt was this which you asked me to tell you, was it not? I will do so\r\nwith pleasure, because I know that I speak to men of honor, and\r\nbecause it is good for me, now that I cannot count the gray hairs in\r\nmy beard, to confess how poor a thing I was when I could count every\r\nhair upon my chin--and how grand a thing I thought myself.\r\n\r\nOne evening, at the end of a dreadful day in the saddle--beneath a sky\r\nwhich seemed to reflect all the fires of hell, a day passed upon sands\r\nsimply smoking in that merciless sun--I and my native companions came\r\nto an encampment of Arabs.\r\n\r\nThey were Bedouins[C]--the tribe does not matter at the moment--and,\r\nas you may know, the Bedouin is the most hospitable creature whom God\r\nhas yet created. The tent of the Sheikh is open to any traveller who\r\ncares to rest his weary limbs therein. Freely he may partake of all\r\nthat the tribe has to offer, food and drink and entertainment; and to\r\nseek to press payment upon the host would be to insult a gentleman.\r\n\r\n  [C] This incorrect but familiar spelling is retained throughout.\r\n\r\nThat is desert hospitality. A spear that stands thrust upright in the\r\nsand before the tent door signifies that whosoever would raise his\r\nhand against the guest has first to reckon with the Sheikh. Equally\r\nit would be an insult to erect one's own tent in the neighborhood of\r\na Bedouin encampment.\r\n\r\nWell, my friends, I knew this well, for I was no stranger to the\r\nnomadic life, and accordingly, without fear of the fierce-eyed throng\r\nwho came forth to meet us, I made my respects to the Sheikh Saïd\r\nMohammed, and was reckoned by him as a friend and a brother. His tent\r\nwas placed at my disposal and provisions were made for the suitable\r\nentertainment of those who were with me.\r\n\r\nYou know how dusk falls in Egypt? At one moment the sky is a brilliant\r\ncanvas, glorious with every color known to art, at the next the\r\ncurtain--the wonderful veil of deepest violet--has fallen; the stars\r\nbreak through it like diamonds through the finest gauze; it is night,\r\nvelvet, violet night. You see it here in this noisy modern Cairo. In\r\nthe lonely desert it is ten thousand times grander, ten thousand times\r\nmore impressive; it speaks to the soul with the voice of the silence.\r\nAh, those desert nights!\r\n\r\nSo was the night of which I speak; and having partaken of the fare\r\nwhich the Sheikh caused to be set before me--and Bedouin fare is not\r\nfor the squeamish stomach--I sipped that delicious coffee which,\r\nthough an acquired taste, is the true nectar, and looked out beyond\r\nthe four or five palm trees of this little oasis to where the gray\r\ncarpet of the desert grew black as ebony and met the violet sweep of\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I was the first to see him; I cannot say; but certainly he was\r\nnot perceived by the Bedouins, although one stood on guard at the\r\nentrance to the camp.\r\n\r\nHow can I describe him? At the time, as he approached in the moonlight\r\nwith a shambling, stooping gait, I felt that I had never seen his like\r\nbefore. Now I know the reason of my wonder, and the reason of my\r\ndoubt. I know what it was about him which inspired a kind of horror\r\nand a revulsion--a dread.\r\n\r\nElfin locks he had, gray and matted, falling about his angular face,\r\nshading his strange, yellow eyes. His was dressed in rags, in tatters;\r\nhe was furtive, and he staggered as one who is very weak, slowly\r\napproaching out of the vastness.\r\n\r\nThen it appeared as though every dog in the camp knew of his coming.\r\nOut from the shadows of the tents they poured, those yapping mongrels.\r\nNever have I seen such a thing. In the midst of the yellowish,\r\nsnarling things, at the very entrance to the camp, the wretched old\r\nman fell, uttering a low cry.\r\n\r\nBut now, snatching up a heavy club which lay close to my hand, I\r\nrushed out of the tent. Others were thronging out too, but, first of\r\nthem all, I burst in among the dogs, striking, kicking, and shouting.\r\nI stooped and raised the head of the stranger.\r\n\r\nMutely he thanked me, with half-closed eyes. A choking sound issued\r\nfrom his throat, and he clutched with his hands and pointed to his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nAn earthenware jar, containing cool water, stood beside a tent but\r\na few yards away. Hurling my club at the most furious of the dogs,\r\nwhich, with bared fangs, still threatened to attack the recumbent man,\r\nI ran and seized the _dorak_, regained his side, and poured water\r\nbetween his parched lips.\r\n\r\nThe throng about me was strangely silent, until, as the poor old man\r\nstaggered again to his feet, supported by my arm, a chorus arose about\r\nme--one long, vowelled word, wholly unfamiliar, although my Arabic was\r\ngood. But I noted that all kept a respectful distance from myself and\r\nthe man whom I had succored.\r\n\r\nThen, pressing his way through the throng came the Sheikh Saïd\r\nMohammed. Saluting the ragged stranger with a sort of grim respect,\r\nhe asked him if he desired entertainment for the night.\r\n\r\nThe other shook his head, mumbling, pointed to the water jar, and by\r\ndint of gnashing his yellow and pointed teeth, intimated that he\r\nrequired food.\r\n\r\nFood was brought to him hurriedly. He tied it up in a dirty cloth,\r\ngrasped the water jar, and, with never a glance at the Arabs, turned\r\nto me. With his hand he touched his brow, his lips, and his breast in\r\nsalute; then, although tottering with weakness, he made off again with\r\nthat queer, loping gait.\r\n\r\nThe camp dogs began to howl, and a strange silence fell upon the Arabs\r\nabout me. All stood watching the departing figure until it was lost in\r\na dip of the desert, when the watchers began to return again to their\r\ntents.\r\n\r\nSaïd Mohammed took my hand, and in a few direct and impressive words\r\nthanked me for having spared him and his tribe from a grave dishonor.\r\nNeed I say that I was flattered? Had you met him, my friends, that\r\nfine Bedouin gentleman, polished as any noble of old France, fearless\r\nas a lion, yet gentle as a woman, you would know that I rejoiced in\r\nbeing able to serve him even so slightly.\r\n\r\nTwo of the dogs, unperceived by us, had followed the weird old man\r\nfrom the camp; for suddenly in the distance I heard their savage\r\ngrowls. Then, these growls were drowned in such a chorus of\r\nhowling--the howling of jackals--as I had never before heard in all my\r\ndesert wanderings. The howling suddenly subsided ... but the dogs did\r\nnot return.\r\n\r\nI glanced around, meaning to address the Sheikh, but the Sheikh was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nFilled with wonder, then, respecting this singular incident, I entered\r\nthe tent--it was at the farther end of the camp--which had been placed\r\nat my disposal, and lay down, rather to reflect than to sleep. With my\r\nmind confused in thoughts of yellow-eyed wanderers, of dogs, and of\r\njackals, sleep came.\r\n\r\nHow long I slept I cannot say; but I was awakened as the cool fingers\r\nof dawn were touching the crests of the sand billows. A gray and\r\ndismal light filled the tent, and something was scratching at the\r\nflap.\r\n\r\nI sat up immediately, quite wide awake, and taking my revolver, ran\r\nto the entrance and looked out.\r\n\r\nA slinking shape melted into the shadows of the tent adjoining mine,\r\nand I concluded that a camp dog had aroused me. Then, in the early\r\nmorning silence, I heard a faint call, and peering through the gloom\r\nto the east saw, in black silhouette, a solitary figure standing near\r\nthe extremity of the camp.\r\n\r\nIn those days, my friends, I was a brave fellow--we are all brave at\r\nnineteen--and throwing a cloak over my shoulders I strode intrepidly\r\ntowards this figure. I was within ten paces when a hand was raised to\r\nbeckon me.\r\n\r\nIt was the mysterious stranger! Again he beckoned to me, and I\r\napproached yet nearer, asking him if it was he who had aroused me.\r\n\r\nHe nodded, and by means of a grotesque kind of pantomime ultimately\r\nmade me understand that he had caused me to be aroused in order to\r\ncommunicate something to me. He turned, and indicated that we were to\r\nwalk away from the camp. I accompanied him without hesitation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the camp was never left unguarded, no one had challenged us;\r\nand, a hundred yards beyond the outermost tent, this strange old man\r\nstopped and turned to me.\r\n\r\nFirst, he pointed back to the camp, then to myself, then out along\r\nthe caravan road towards the Nile.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean,\" I asked him--for I perceived that he was dumb or vowed\r\nto silence--\"that I am to leave the camp?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded rapidly, his strange yellow eyes gleaming.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately?\" I demanded.\r\n\r\nAgain he nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\nPantomimically he made me understand that death threatened me if I\r\nremained--that I must leave the Bedouins before sunrise.\r\n\r\nI cannot convey to you any idea of the mad earnestness of the man.\r\nBut, alas! youth regards the counsels of age with nothing but\r\ncontempt; moreover, I thought this man mad, and I was unable to choke\r\ndown a sort of loathing which he inspired in me.\r\n\r\nI shook my head then, but not unkindly; and, waving my hand, prepared\r\nto leave him. At that, with a sorrow in his strange eyes which did not\r\nfail to impress me, he saluted me with gravity, turned, and passed out\r\nof sight.\r\n\r\nAlthough I did not know it at the time, I had chosen of two paths the\r\none that led through fire.\r\n\r\nI slept little after this interview--if it was a real interview and\r\nnot a dream--and feeling tired and unrefreshed, I saw the sun rise\r\npurple and angry over the distant hills.\r\n\r\nYou know what _khamsîn_ is like, my friends? But you cannot know what\r\n_simoom_ is like--_simoom_ in the heart of the desert! It came that\r\nmorning--a wall of sand so high as to shut out the sunlight, so dense\r\nas to turn the day into night, so suffocating that I thought I should\r\nnever live through it!\r\n\r\nIt was apparent to me that the Bedouins were prepared for the storm.\r\nThe horses, the camels and the asses were tethered in an enclosure\r\nspecially strengthened to exclude the choking dust, and with their\r\ncloaks about their heads the men prepared for the oncoming of this\r\nterror of the desert.\r\n\r\nMy God! it was a demon which sought to blind me, to suffocate me,\r\nand which clutched at my throat with strangling fingers of sand! This,\r\nI told myself, was the danger which I might have avoided by quitting\r\nthe camp before sunrise.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was apparent to me that if I had taken the advice so\r\nstrangely offered, I might now have been safe in the village of the\r\nGreat Oasis for which I was bound. But I have since seen that the\r\n_simoom_ was a minor danger, and not the real one to which this weird\r\nbeing had referred.\r\n\r\nThe storm passed, and every man in the encampment praised the merciful\r\nGod who had spared us all. It was in the disturbance attendant upon\r\nputting the camp in order once more that I saw her.\r\n\r\nShe came out from the tent of Saïd Mohammed, to shake the sand from\r\na carpet; the newly come sunlight twinkled upon the bracelets which\r\nclasped her smooth brown arms as she shook the gaily colored mat at\r\nthe tent door. The sunlight shone upon her braided hair, upon her\r\nslight robe, upon her silver anklets, and upon her tiny feet.\r\nTransfixed I stood watching--indeed, my friends, almost holding my\r\nbreath. Then the sunlight shone upon her eyes, two pools of mysterious\r\ndarkness into which I found myself suddenly looking.\r\n\r\nThe face of this lovely Arab maiden flushed, and drawing the corner of\r\nher robe across those bewitching eyes, she turned and ran back into\r\nthe tent.\r\n\r\nOne glance--just one glance, my friends! But never had Ulysses' bow\r\npropelled an arrow more sure, more deadly. I was nineteen, remember,\r\nand of Provence. What do you foresee! You who have been through the\r\nworld, you who once were nineteen.\r\n\r\nI feigned a sickness, a sickness brought about by the sandstorm, and\r\ntaking base advantage of that desert hospitality which is unbounded,\r\nwhich knows no suspicion, and takes no count of cost, I remained in\r\nthe tent which had been vacated for me.\r\n\r\nIn this voluntary confinement I learned little of the doings of the\r\ncamp. All day I lay dreaming of two dark eyes, and at night when the\r\njackals howled I thought of the wanderer who had counseled me to\r\nleave. One day, I lay so; a second; a third again; and the women of\r\nSaïd Mohammed's household tended me, closely veiled of course. But in\r\nvain I waited for that attendant whose absence was rendering my\r\nfeigned fever a real one--whose eyes burned like torches in my dreams\r\nand for the coming of whose little bare feet across the sand to my\r\ntent door I listened hour by hour, day by day, in vain--always in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nBut at nineteen there is no such thing as despair, and hope has\r\nstrength to defy death itself. It was in the violet dusk of the fourth\r\nday, as I lay there with a sort of shame of my deception struggling\r\nfor birth in my heart, that she came.\r\n\r\nShe came through the tent door bearing a bowl of soup, and the rays of\r\nthe setting sun outlined her fairy shape through the gossamer robe as\r\nshe entered.\r\n\r\nAt that my poor weak little conscience troubled me no more. How my\r\nheart leaped, leaped so that it threatened to choke me, who had come\r\nsafe through a great sandstorm.\r\n\r\nThere is fire in the Southern blood at nineteen, my friends, which\r\nleaps into flame beneath the glances of bright eyes.\r\n\r\nWith her face modestly veiled, the Bedouin maid knelt beside me,\r\nplacing the wooden bowl upon the ground. My eager gaze pierced the\r\n_yashmak_, but her black lashes were laid upon her cheek, her glorious\r\neyes averted. My heart--or was it my vanity?--told me that she\r\nregarded me at least with interest, that she was not at ease in my\r\ncompany; and as, having spoken no word, having ventured no glance,\r\nshe rose again to depart, I was emboldened to touch her hand.\r\n\r\nLike a startled gazelle she gave me one rapid glance, and was gone!\r\n\r\nShe was gone--and my very soul gone with her! For hours I lay, not so\r\nmuch as thinking of the food beside me--dreaming of her eyes. What\r\nwere my plans? Faith! Does one have plans at nineteen where two bright\r\neyes are concerned?\r\n\r\nAlas, my friends, I dare not tell you of my hopes, yet upon those\r\nhopes I lived. Oh, it is glorious to be nineteen and of Provence; it\r\nis glorious when all the world is young, when the fruit is ripe upon\r\nthe trees and the plucking seems no sin. Yet, as we look back, we\r\nperceive that at nineteen we were scoundrels.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouin girl is a woman when a European woman is but a child, and\r\nSakîna, whose eyes could search a man's soul, was but twelve years of\r\nage--twelve! Can you picture that child of twelve squeezing a lover's\r\nheart between her tiny hands, entwining his imagination in the coils\r\nof her hair?\r\n\r\nYou, my friend, may perhaps be able to conceive this thing, for you\r\nknow the East, and the women of the East. At ten or eleven years of\r\nage many of them are adorable; at twenty-one most of them are _passé_;\r\nat twenty-six all of them--with rare exceptions--are shrieking hags.\r\n\r\nBut to you, my other friends, who are strangers to our Oriental ways,\r\nwho know not that the peach only attains to perfect ripeness for one\r\nshort hour, it may be strange, it may be horrifying, that I loved,\r\nwith all the ardor which was mine, this little Arab maiden, who, had\r\nshe been born in France, would not yet have escaped from the nursery.\r\nBut I digress.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs were encamped, of course, in the neighborhood of a spring.\r\nIt lay in a slight depression amid the tiny palm-grove. Here, at\r\nsunset, came the women with their pitchers on their heads, graceful\r\nof carriage, veiled, mysterious.\r\n\r\nMany peaches have ripened and have rotted since those days of which\r\nI speak, but now--even now--I am still enslaved by the mystery of\r\nEgypt's veiled women. Untidy, bedraggled, dirty, she may be, but the\r\nreal Egyptian woman when she bears her pitcher upon her head and\r\nglides, stately, sinuously, through the dusk to the well, is a figure\r\nto enchain the imagination.\r\n\r\nVery soon, then, the barrier of reserve which, like the screen of the\r\n_harêm_, stands between Eastern women and love, was broken. My trivial\r\nscruples I had cast to the winds, and feigning weakness, I would sally\r\nforth to take the air in the cool of the evening; this two days later.\r\n\r\nMy steps, be assured, led me to the spring; and you who are men of the\r\nworld will know that Sakîna, braving the reproaches of the Sheikh's\r\nhousehold, neglectful of her duties, was last of all the women who\r\ncame to the well for water.\r\n\r\nI taught her to say my name--René! How sweet it sounded from her lips,\r\nas she strove in vain to roll the 'R' in our Provençal fashion. Some\r\n_ginnee_ most certainly presided over this enchanted fountain, for\r\ndespite the nearness of the camp our rendezvous was never discovered,\r\nour meetings were never detected.\r\n\r\nWith her pitcher upon the ground beside her, she would sit with those\r\nwistful, wonderful eyes upraised to mine, and sway before the ardor of\r\nmy impassioned words as a young and tender reed sways in the Nile\r\nbreeze. Her budding soul was a love lute upon which I played in\r\necstasy; and when she raised her red lips to mine.... Ah! those nights\r\nin the boundless desert! God is good to youth, and harsh to old age!\r\n\r\nNext to Saïd Mohammed, her father, Sakîna's brother was the finest\r\nhorseman of the tribe, and his white mare their fleetest steed. I\r\nhad cast covetous eyes upon this glorious creature, my friends, and\r\nsecretly had made such overtures as were calculated to win her\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks, then, my plans were complete--up to a point. Since\r\nthey were doomed to failure, like my great scheme, I shall not trouble\r\nyou with their details, but an hour before dawn on a certain night I\r\ncut the camel-hair tethering of the white mare, and, undetected, led\r\nthe beautiful creature over the silent sands to a cup-like depression,\r\na thousand yards distant from the camp.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouin who was upon guard that night had with him a gourd of\r\n_'erksoos_. This was customary, and I had chosen an occasion when the\r\nduty of filling the sentinel's gourd had fallen upon Sakîna; to his\r\n_'erksoos_ I had added four drops of dark brown fluid from my medicine\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nIt was an hour before dawn, then, when I stood beside the white mare,\r\nwatching and listening; it was an hour before dawn when she for whom\r\nmy great scheme was forgotten, for whom I was about to risk the anger,\r\nthe just anger, of men amongst the most fierce in the known world,\r\ncame running fleetly over the hillocks down into the little valley,\r\nand threw herself into my arms....\r\n\r\nWhen dawn burst in gloomy splendor over the desert, we were still five\r\nhours' ride from the spot where I had proposed temporarily to conceal\r\nmyself, with perhaps an hour's start of the Arabs. I knew the desert\r\nways well enough, but the ghostly and desolate place in which I now\r\nfound myself nevertheless filled me with foreboding.\r\n\r\nA seam of black volcanic rock split the sands for a great distance,\r\nforming a kind of natural wall of forbidding aspect. In places this\r\nwall was pierced by tunnel-like openings; I think they may have been\r\nprehistoric tombs. There was no scrap of verdure visible, north,\r\nsouth, east or west; only desolation, sand, grayness, and this place,\r\nghostly and wan with that ancient sorrow, that odor of remote\r\nmortality which is called \"the dust of Egypt.\"\r\n\r\nSeated before me in the saddle, Sakîna looked up into my face with a\r\nnever-changing confidence, having her little brown fingers interlocked\r\nabout my neck. But her strength was failing. A short rest was\r\nimperative.\r\n\r\nThus far I had detected no evidence of pursuit and, descending from\r\nthe saddle, I placed my weary companion upon a rock over which I had\r\nlaid a rug, and poured out for her a draught of cool water.\r\n\r\nBread and dates were our breakfast fare; but bread and dates and water\r\nare nectar and ambrosia when they are sweetened with kisses. Oh! the\r\nglorious madness of youth! Sometimes, my friends, I am almost tempted\r\nto believe that the man who has never been wicked has never been\r\nhappy!\r\n\r\nPicture us, then, if you can, set amid that desolation, which for us\r\nwas a rose-garden, eating of that unpalatable food--which for us was\r\nthe food of the gods!\r\n\r\nSo we remained awhile, deliriously happy, though death might terminate\r\nour joys ere we again saw the sun, when something ... _something_\r\nspoke to me....\r\n\r\nUnderstand me, I did not say that _someone_ spoke, I did not say that\r\nanything _audible_ spoke. But I know that, unlocking those velvet arms\r\nwhich clung to me, I stood up slowly--and, still slowly, turned and\r\nlooked back at the frowning black rocks.\r\n\r\nMerciful God! My heart beats wildly now when I recall that moment.\r\n\r\nMotionless as a statue, but in a crouching attitude, as if about to\r\nleap down, he who had warned me so truly stood upon the highest point\r\nof the rocks watching us!\r\n\r\nHow long did I remain thus?\r\n\r\nI cannot pretend to say; but when I turned to Sakîna--she lay\r\ntrembling on the ground, with her face hidden in her hands.\r\n\r\nThen, down over the piled-up rocks, this mysterious and ominous being\r\ncame leaping. Old man though he was, he descended with the agility of\r\na mountain goat--and sometimes, in the difficult places, _he went on\r\nall fours_.\r\n\r\nCrossing the intervening strip of sand, he stood before me. You have\r\nseen the reproach in the eyes of a faithful dog whose master has\r\nstruck him unjustly? Such a reproach shone out from the yellow eyes of\r\nthis desert wanderer. I cannot account for it; I can say no more....\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for me to speak; I trembled violently; such a fear\r\nand such a madness of sorrow possessed me that I would have welcomed\r\nany death--to have freed me from that intolerable reproach.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly pointed towards the horizon where against the curtain of\r\nthe dawn black figures appeared.\r\n\r\nI fell upon my knees beside Sakîna. I was a poor, pitiable thing; the\r\nmadness of my passion had left me, and already I was within the great\r\nShadow; I could not even weep; I knew that I had brought Sakîna out\r\ninto that desolate place--to die.\r\n\r\nAnd now the man whose ways were unlike human ways began to babble\r\ninsanely, gesticulating and plucking at me. I cannot hope to make you\r\nfeel one little part of the emotion with which those instants were\r\nladen. Sakîna clung to me trembling in a way I can never\r\nforget--never, never forget. And the look in her eyes! even now I\r\ncannot bear to think of it, I cannot bear----\r\n\r\nThose almost colorless lizards which dart about in the desert places\r\nwith incredible swiftness were now coming forth from their nests; and\r\nall the while the black figures, unheard as yet, were approaching\r\nalong the path of the sun.\r\n\r\nMy mad folly grew more apparent to me every moment. I realized that\r\nthis which so rapidly was overtaking me had been inevitable from the\r\nfirst. The strange wild man stood watching me with that intolerable\r\nglare, so that my trembling companion shrank from him in horror.\r\n\r\nBut evidently he was seeking to convey some idea to me. He\r\ngesticulated constantly, pointing to the approaching Arabs and then\r\nover his shoulder to the frowning rock behind. Since it was too late\r\nfor flight--for I knew that the white mare with a double burden could\r\nnever outpace our pursuers--it occurred to me at the moment when the\r\nmuffled beat of hoofs first became audible, that this hermit of the\r\nrocks was endeavoring to induce me to seek some hiding-place with\r\nwhich no doubt he was acquainted.\r\n\r\nHow I cursed the delay which had enabled the Arabs to come up with us!\r\nI know, now, of course, that even had I not delayed, our ultimate\r\ncapture was certain. But at the moment, in my despair, I thought\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd now I cursed the stupidity which had prevented me from following\r\nthis weird guide; I even thought wrathfully of the poor frightened\r\nchild, whose weakness had necessitated the delay and whose fears had\r\ncontributed considerably to this later misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe pursuing party, numbering four, and led by Saïd Mohammed, was no\r\nmore than five hundred yards away when I came to my senses. The hermit\r\nnow was tugging at my arm with frightful insistence; his eyes were\r\nglaring insanely, and he chattered in an almost pitiable manner.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" I cried, throwing my arm about Sakîna, \"up to the rocks. This\r\nman can hide us!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" she whispered, \"I dare not----\"\r\n\r\nBut I lifted her, and signing to the singular being to lead the way,\r\nstaggered forward despairingly.\r\n\r\nThe distance was greater than it appeared, the climb incredibly\r\ndifficult. My guide held out his hand to me to assist me to mount the\r\nslippery rocks; but I had much ado to proceed and also to support\r\nSakîna.\r\n\r\nHer terror of the man and of the place to which he was leading us\r\nmomentarily increased. Indeed, it seemed that she was becoming mad\r\nwith fear. When the man paused before an opening in the rocks not\r\nmore than fifteen or sixteen inches in height, and wildly waving\r\nhis arms in the air, his elfin locks flying about his shoulder, his\r\neyes glassy, intimated that we were to crawl in--Sakîna writhed free\r\nof my grasp and bounded back some three or four paces down the slope.\r\n\r\n\"Not in there!\" she cried, holding out her little hands to me\r\npitifully. \"I dare not! He would devour us!\"\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the slope, Saïd Mohammed, who had dismounted from his\r\nhorse, and who, far ahead of the others, was advancing towards us,\r\nat that moment raised his gun and fired....\r\n\r\nCan I go on?\r\n\r\nIt is more years ago than I care to count, but it is fresher in my\r\nmind than the things of yesterday. A lonely old age is before me, my\r\nfriends--for I have been a solitary man since that shot was fired. For\r\nme it changed the face of the world, for me it ended youth, revealing\r\nme to myself for what I was.\r\n\r\nSomething more nearly resembling human speech than any sound he had\r\nyet uttered burst from the lips of the wild man as the report of Saïd\r\nMohammed's shot whispered in echoes through the mysterious labyrinths\r\nbeneath us.\r\n\r\nFate had stood at the Sheikh's elbow as he pulled the trigger.\r\n\r\nWith a little soft cry--I hear it now, gentle, but having in it a\r\nworld of agony--Sakîna sank at my feet ... and her blood began to\r\ntrickle over the black rocks on which she lay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe man who professes to describe to you his emotions at such a\r\nfrightful moment is an impostor. The world grew black before my eyes;\r\nevery emotion of which my being was capable became paralysed.\r\n\r\nI heard nothing, I saw nothing but the little huddled figure, that red\r\nstream upon the black rock, and the agonized love in the blazing eyes\r\nof Sakîna. Groaning, I threw myself down beside her, and as she sighed\r\nout her life upon my breast, I knew--God help me--that what had been\r\nbut a youthful amour, was now a life's tragedy; that for me the light\r\nof the world had gone out, that I should never again know the warmth\r\nof the sun and the gladness of the morning....\r\n\r\nThe cave man, with a dog-like fidelity, sought now to drag me from my\r\ndead love, to drag me into that gloomy lair which she had shrunk from\r\nentering. His incoherent mutterings broke in upon my semi-coma; but I\r\nshook him off, I shrieked curses at him....\r\n\r\nNow the Bedouins were mounting the slope, not less than a hundred\r\nyards below me. In the growing light I could see the face of Saïd\r\nMohammed....\r\n\r\nThe man beside me exerted all his strength to drag me back into the\r\ngallery or cave--I know not what it was; but with my arms locked about\r\nSakîna I lay watching the pursuers coming closer and closer.\r\n\r\nThen, those persistent efforts suddenly ceased, and dully I told\r\nmyself that this weird being, having done his best to save me, had\r\nfled in order to save himself.\r\n\r\nI was wrong.\r\n\r\nYou have asked me for a story of the magic of Egypt, and although,\r\nas you see, it has cost me tears--oh! I am not ashamed of those tears,\r\nmy friends!--I have recounted this story to you. You say, where is the\r\nmagic? and I might reply: the magic was in the changing of my false\r\nlove to a true. But there was another magic as well, and it grew up\r\naround me now at this moment when I lay inert, waiting for death.\r\n\r\nFrom behind me, from above me, arose a cry--a cry. You may have heard\r\nof the Bedouin song, the 'Mizmûne':\r\n\r\n    \"Ya men melek ana dêri waat sa jebb,\r\n     Id el' ish hoos' a beb hatsa azât ta lebb.\"\r\n\r\nYou may have heard how when it is sung in a certain fashion, flowers\r\ndrop from their stalks? Also, you may have doubted this, never having\r\nheard a magical cry.\r\n\r\n_I_ do not doubt it, my friends! For I _have_ heard a magical\r\ncry--this cry which arose from behind me! It started some chord in my\r\ndulled consciousness which had never spoken before. I turned my\r\nhead--and there upon the highest point of the rocks stood the cave\r\nman. He suddenly stretched forth his hands.\r\n\r\nAgain he uttered that uncanny, that indescribable cry. It was not\r\nhuman. It was not animal. Yet it was nearer to the cry of an animal\r\nthan to any sound made by the human species. His eyes gleamed with an\r\nawful light, his spare body had assumed a strange significance; he was\r\ntransfigured.\r\n\r\nA third time he uttered the cry, and out from one of those openings in\r\nthe rock which I have mentioned, crept a jackal. You know how a jackal\r\navoids the day, how furtive, how nocturnal a creature it is? but there\r\nin the golden glory which proclaimed the coming of the sun, black\r\nsilhouettes moved.\r\n\r\nA great wonder possessed me, as the first jackal was followed by a\r\nsecond, by a third, by a fourth, by a fifth. Did I say a fifth?...\r\nBy five hundred--by five thousand!\r\n\r\nFrom every visible hole in the rocks, jackals poured forth in packs.\r\nWonder left me, fear left me; I forgot my sorrow, I became a numbed\r\nintelligence amid a desert of jackals. Over a sea of moving furry\r\nbacks, I saw that upstanding crag and the weird crouching figure upon\r\nit. Right and left, above and below, jackals moved ... and all turned\r\ntheir heads towards the approaching Bedouins!\r\n\r\nAgain--again I heard that dreadful cry. The jackals, in a pack,\r\nthousands strong, began to advance upon the Bedouins!...\r\n\r\nNot east or west, north or south, could you hope to find a braver man\r\nthan was the Sheikh Saïd Mohammed; but--he fled!\r\n\r\nI saw the four horsemen riding like furies into the morning sun. The\r\nwhite mare, riderless, galloped with them--and the desert behind was\r\nyellow with jackals! For the last time I heard the cry.\r\n\r\nThe jackals began to return!\r\n\r\nForgive me, dear friends, if I seem an emotional fool. But when I\r\nrecovered from the swoon which blotted out that unnatural spectacle,\r\nthe wizard--for now I knew him for nothing less--had dug a deep\r\ntrench--and had left me, alone.\r\n\r\nNot a jackal was in sight; the sun blazed cruelly upon the desert.\r\nWith my own hands I laid my love to rest in the sands. No cross, no\r\ncrescent marks her resting-place; but I left my youth upon her grave,\r\nas a last offering.\r\n\r\nYou may say that, since I had sinned so grievously, since I had\r\nbetrayed the noble confidence of Saïd Mohammed, my host, I escaped\r\nlightly.\r\n\r\nAh! you do not know!\r\n\r\nAnd what of the strange being whose gratitude I had done so little to\r\nmerit but yet which knew no bounds? It is of him that I will tell you.\r\n\r\nYears later--how many it does not matter, but I was a man with no\r\nillusions--my restless wanderings (I being still a desert\r\nbird-of-passage) brought me one night to a certain well but rarely\r\nvisited. It lay in a depression, like another well that I am fated\r\noften to see in my dreams, and, as one approached, the crowns of the\r\npalm trees which grew there appeared above the mounds of sand.\r\n\r\nI was alone and tired out; the next possible camping-place--for I had\r\nno water--was many miles away. Yet it was written that I should press\r\non to that other distant well, weary though I was.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, as I came up, I perceived numbers of vultures in the air;\r\nand I began to fear that someone near to his end lay at the well. But\r\nwhen, from the top of a mound, I obtained a closer view, I saw a sight\r\nthat, after one quick glance, caused me to spur up my tired horse and\r\nto fly--fly, with panic in my heart.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant moon bathed the hollow in light and cast dense shadows\r\nof the palm stems upon the slope beyond. By the spring, his fallen\r\nface ghastly in the moonlight, in a clear space twenty feet across,\r\nlay a dead man.\r\n\r\nEven from where I sat I knew him; but, had I doubted, other evidence\r\nwas there of his identity. As I mounted the slope, thousands of fiery\r\neyes were turned upon me.\r\n\r\nGod! that arena all about was alive with jackals--jackals, my friends,\r\neaters of carrion--which, silent, watchful, guarded the wizard dead,\r\nwho, living, had been their lord!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLURE OF SOULS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThis is the story which Bernard Fane told me one afternoon as we sat\r\nsipping China tea in the Heliopolis Palace Hotel, following a round\r\nupon the neighboring links.\r\n\r\nThe life of a master at the training college (said Fane) is beastly\r\nuneventful, taken all around; not even _your_ keen sense of the\r\nromantic could long survive it. The duties are not very exacting,\r\ncertainly, and in our own way I suppose we are Empire builders of a\r\nsort; but when you ask me for a true story of Egyptian life, I find\r\nmyself floored at once.\r\n\r\nWe all come out with the idea of the mystic East strong upon us, but\r\nit is an idea that rarely survives one summer in Cairo. Personally, I\r\nmade a more promising start than the average; an adventure came my way\r\non the very day I landed in Port Said, in fact it began on the way\r\nout. But alas! it was not only the first, but the last adventure which\r\nEgypt has offered me.\r\n\r\nI have not related the story more than five hundred times, so that you\r\nwill excuse me if I foozle it in places. I will leave you to do the\r\npolishing.\r\n\r\nOn my first trip out, then, I joined the ship at Marseilles, and saw\r\nmy cabin trunk placed in a nice deck berth, with the liveliest\r\nsatisfaction. Walking along the white promenade deck, I felt no end of\r\na man of the world. Every Anglo-Indian that I met seemed a figure from\r\nthe pages of Kipling, and when I accidentally blundered into the\r\n_ayahs'_ quarters, I could almost hear the jangle of the temple bells,\r\nso primed was I with traditions of the Orient--the traditions one\r\ngathers from books of the lighter sort, I mean.\r\n\r\nYou will see that in those days I was not a bit _blasé_; the glamour\r\nof the East was very real to me. For that matter, it is more real than\r\never, now; Near or Far, the East has a call which, once heard, can\r\nnever be forgotten, and never be unheeded. But the call it makes to\r\nthose who have never been there is out of tune, I have learned; or\r\nrather, it is not in the right key.\r\n\r\nWell, I had a most glorious bath--I am sybarite enough to love the\r\nluxuriance of your modern liner--got into blue serge, and felt no end\r\nof an adventurer. There was a notice on the gangway that the steamer\r\nwould not leave Marseilles until ten o'clock at night, but I was far\r\ntoo young a traveller to risk missing the boat by going ashore again.\r\nYou know the feeling? Consequently I took my place in the saloon for\r\ndinner, and vaguely wondered why nobody else had dressed for the\r\nfunction. I was a proper Johnny Raw, no end of a Johnny Raw, but I\r\nenjoyed it all immensely, nevertheless. I personally superintended the\r\ndeparture of the ship, and believed that every deck-hand took me for a\r\nhardened globe-trotter; and when at last I sought my cosy cabin, all\r\nspotlessly white, with my trunk tucked under the bunk, and, drawing\r\nthe little red curtain, I sat down to sum up the sensations of the\r\nday, I was thoroughly satisfied with it all.\r\n\r\nGad! novelty is the keynote of life, don't you think? When one is\r\nyoung, one envies older and more experienced men, but what has the\r\nworld left of novelty to offer them? The simple matter of joining a\r\nsteamboat, and taking possession of my berth, had afforded me thrills\r\nwhich some of my fellow-passengers--those whom I envied the most for\r\nthe stories of life written upon their tanned features--could only\r\nhope to taste by means of big-game hunting, now, or other far-fetched\r\nmethods of thrill-giving.\r\n\r\nIt wore off a bit the next day, of course, and I found that once one\r\nhas settled down to it, ocean traveling is merely floating hotel life.\r\nBut many of my fellow-passengers (the boat was fairly full) still\r\nappealed to me as books of romance which I longed to open. And before\r\nthe end of that second day, I became possessed of the idea that there\r\nwas some deep mystery aboard. Since this was my first voyage,\r\nsomething of that sort was to be expected of me; but it happened that\r\nI stood by no means alone in this belief.\r\n\r\nIn the smoking-room, after dinner, I got into conversation with a\r\nchap of about my own age who was bound for Colombo--tea-planting. We\r\nchatted on different topics for half an hour, and discovered that we\r\nhad mutual friends, or rather, the other fellow discovered it.\r\n\r\n\"Have you noticed,\" he said, \"a distinguished-looking Indian\r\npersonage, who, with three native friends, sits at the small corner\r\ntable on our left?\"\r\n\r\nHamilton--that was my acquaintance's name--was my right-hand neighbor\r\nat the chief officer's table, and I recollected the group to which he\r\nreferred immediately.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied; \"who are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Hamilton, \"but I have a suspicion that they\r\nare mysterious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mysterious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they joined at Marseilles, just before yourself. They were\r\nreceived by the skipper in person, and two of them were closeted in\r\nhis cabin for twenty minutes or more.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't make anything of it, but their whole behavior strikes me as\r\npeculiar, somehow. I cannot quite explain myself, but you say that you\r\nhave noticed something of the sort, yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"They certainly keep very much to themselves,\" I said. Hamilton\r\nglanced at me quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Naturally,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nNot desiring to appear stupid, I did not ask him to elucidate this\r\nremark, although at the time it meant nothing to me. Of course I have\r\nlearned since, as everyone learns whose lines are cast among\r\nOrientals, that iron barriers divide the races. But at the time I knew\r\nnothing of this--as will shortly appear.\r\n\r\nDuring breakfast on the following morning, I glanced several times at\r\nthe mysterious quartette. They had been placed at a separate table and\r\nwere served with different courses from the rest of the passengers. I\r\nwas not the only member of the company who found them interesting, but\r\nthe Anglo-Indians on board, to a man, left the native party severely\r\nalone. You know the icy aloofness of the Anglo-Indians?\r\n\r\nMy second day at sea wore on, uneventfully enough; the bugle had\r\nalready announced the hour for dressing, and the boat-deck outside\r\nmy berth, where I had had my chair placed, was practically deserted,\r\nwhen something occurred to turn my thoughts from the four Indians.\r\nIt was a glorious evening, with the sun setting out across the\r\nMediterranean in such a red blaze of glory that I sat watching it\r\nfascinatedly, my book lying unheeded on the deck beside me. Right\r\nand left of me men occupying the other deck cabins had lighted up,\r\nand were busily dressing. Right aft was a corner cabin, larger than\r\nthe others, and suddenly I observed the door of this to open.\r\n\r\nA slim figure glided out on to the deck, and began to advance toward\r\nme. It proved to be that of a woman or girl dressed in clinging black\r\nsilk, and wearing a _yashmak_! She had a richly embroidered shawl\r\nthrown over her head and shoulders, and in that coy half-light she\r\npresented a dazzlingly beautiful picture.\r\n\r\nIt was my first sight of a _yashmak_, and, because it was worn by a\r\nmarvelously pretty woman, the thousands seen since have never entirely\r\nlost their charm for me. I could detect the lines of an exquisitely\r\nchiseled nose, and the long dark eyes of the apparition were entirely\r\nunforgettable. The hand with which she held her shawl about her was of\r\nivory smoothness, and, like a little red lamp, a great ruby blazed\r\nupon the index finger.\r\n\r\nWith her high-heeled shoes tapping daintily upon the deck she\r\nadvanced; then, suddenly perceiving that the promenade was not\r\nentirely deserted, she turned, but not hastily or rudely, and glided\r\nback to her cabin.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to outline for your benefit the state of my mind at\r\nthis period, hinting how keenly alive I was to romance of any sort,\r\nprovided it wore the guise of the Orient; so that it will be\r\nunnecessary for me to explain how strong an impression this episode\r\nmade upon me. The Indian party was forgotten, and as I hastily dressed\r\nand descended to dinner, I scarcely listened to Hamilton when he bent\r\ntoward me and whispered something about the \"Strong Room.\"\r\n\r\nMy gaze was roaming about the spacious saloon. Even in those days I\r\nmight have known better; I might have known that no Mohammedan woman\r\nwould take her meals in a public saloon. But I was too dazzled by my\r\nmemories to summon to my aid such fragments of knowledge respecting\r\nEastern customs as were mine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWell, some little time elapsed before I saw or heard anything further\r\nof the houri. I began to settle down to the routine of the trip, and\r\n(you know how news circulates through a ship?) it was not very long\r\nbefore I knew as much as any of the other passengers knew.\r\n\r\nHamilton was a sort of filter through which it all came to me, and of\r\ncourse it was not undiluted, but colored with his own views. The lady\r\nof the _yashmak_, he informed me, was a member of the household of a\r\nwealthy Moslem in the neighborhood of Damascus. She was travelling via\r\nPort Said, and taking a Khedivial boat from there to Beyrût. He was a\r\nperfect mine of information, but his real interest was centered all\r\nthe time on the party of four Indians.\r\n\r\n\"They are emissaries of the Rajah of Bhotana,\" he informed me\r\nconfidentially. \"The mystery begins to clear up. You must have read\r\nabout a month ago that Lola de l'Iris was selling some of her jewelery\r\nand devoting the proceeds to the founding of an orphanage or something\r\nof the kind; quite a unique advertisement. Well, the famous Indian\r\ndiamond presented to her by one of the crowned heads of Europe was\r\namongst the bunch which she sold; and after staying in the West for\r\nover fifty years, it is again on its way back to the East where it\r\ncame from.\"\r\n\r\nI began to recollect the circumstances, now; the historic Indian\r\ndiamond--I do not know Hindustanî, but its name translated means \"Lure\r\nof Souls\"--had been in the possession of the dancer for many years,\r\nand its sale for such a purpose had turned the limelight upon her most\r\nenviably. It was a new idea in advertising, and had proved an\r\nadmirable success.\r\n\r\nSo the four reticent gentlemen were the guardians of the diamond.\r\nUnder normal circumstances this might have been interesting, but, as\r\nI have tried to make clear, another matter engrossed my attention. In\r\nfact, I was living in a dream-world.\r\n\r\nOf course, my opportunity came, in due course. One evening, as I\r\nmooned on the shadowy deck--which was quite deserted, because an\r\nextempore dance was taking place on the deck below--_she_ came gliding\r\nalong towards me. I could see her eyes sparkling in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nAt first I feared that she was going to turn back. She hesitated, in\r\na wildly alluring manner, when first she saw me sitting there watching\r\nher. Then, turning her head aside, she came on, and passed me. I never\r\ntook my eyes off that graceful figure for a moment.\r\n\r\nComing to the rail, she leaned and looked out toward the coast of\r\nCrete, where silver tracings in the blue marked the mountain peaks;\r\nthen, shivering slightly, and wrapping her embroidered shawl more\r\nclosely about her shoulders, she retraced her steps.\r\n\r\nNot a yard from where I sat, she dropped a little silk handkerchief\r\non the deck!\r\n\r\nHow my heart leapt at that! the rest was a magical whirl; and ten\r\nseconds later I was chatting with her.\r\n\r\nShe spoke fluent French, but little English.\r\n\r\nShe appealed to me in a way that was new and almost irresistible; it\r\nwas an appeal quite Oriental, sensuous--indescribable. I just wanted\r\nto take her in my arms and kiss those tantalizing lips; talking seemed\r\na waste of time. Of course, I cannot hope to make you understand; but\r\nit was extraordinary. I felt that I was losing my head; the glances of\r\nthose long dark eyes were setting me on fire.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, she terminated this, our first _tête-à-tête_. She raised her\r\nfinger to her veiled lips and glided away into the shadows like a\r\nphantom. A sentence died, unfinished, on my tongue. I turned, and\r\nlooked over my shoulder.\r\n\r\nGad! I got a fright! A most hideous Oriental of some kind, having only\r\none eye but that afire with malignancy, was watching me from where he\r\nstood half concealed by a boat.\r\n\r\nMy lily of Damascus was guarded!\r\n\r\nHumming, with an assumption of unconcern, I strolled away and joined\r\nthe dancers below.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning, then. I cursed to think how short a time was\r\nat my disposal; but since, the very next morning, I found myself\r\nenjoying a second delicious little stolen interview, I perceived that\r\nmy company was not unacceptable.\r\n\r\nWhat? oh, I had lost my head entirely; I admit it.\r\n\r\nIt was an effort to speak of matters ordinary, topics of the ship; my\r\nimpulse was to whisper delicious nonsense into those tiny ears.\r\nHowever, I forced myself to talk about things in general, and told her\r\nthat the famous diamond, Lure of Souls, was aboard.\r\n\r\nThis was news to her, and she seemed to be tremendously interested.\r\nHer interest was of such a childish sort, so naïve, that the project\r\ngrew up in my mind at that very moment--the project that was to\r\nterminate so disastrously. It was hardly a matter of so many words;\r\nthere was nothing definite about the thing at all, and this, our\r\nsecond interview, was cut short in much the same manner as the first.\r\n\r\n\"_Ssh! Mustapha!_\"\r\n\r\nWith those whispered words, and a dazzling smile, this jewel of\r\nDamascus who interested me so much more deeply than the Rajah's\r\ndiamond, departed hurriedly--and I turned to meet again the malignant\r\ngaze of the wall-eyed guardian.\r\n\r\nThe sort of romance in which I was steeped at that time flourishes and\r\ngrows fat upon incidents of this kind. I have searched my memory many\r\na time since then, for some word or hint to prove that the\r\nconversation about the diamond was opened and guided in a desired\r\ndirection by the lady of the _yashmak_; but excluding transmission of\r\nthought, I could never find any evidence of the kind--have never been\r\nable to do so.\r\n\r\nCertainly my memories of that period are hazy except in regard to\r\nNahèmah. If I were an artist, I could paint her portrait from memory\r\nwithout the slightest error, I think. She occupied my thoughts to the\r\nexclusion of all else. But the project was formed and carried out.\r\nHamilton was one of those popular men who seem born to occupy the\r\nchair at any kind of meeting at which they may be present; he\r\norganized almost every entertainment that took place on board. At\r\nfirst he was not at all keen on the idea.\r\n\r\n\"There are all sorts of difficulties,\" he said; \"and one doesn't care\r\nto ask a favor of a native. At any rate one doesn't care to be\r\nrefused.\"\r\n\r\nBut I had set my heart upon gratifying Nahèmah's curiosity, and, with\r\nthe aid of Hamilton, it was all arranged satisfactorily. The native\r\nguardians of the diamond were rather flattered than otherwise, and a\r\nselect little party of the \"best\" people on board met in the chief\r\nofficer's cabin to view Lure of Souls.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in regard to Nahèmah was readily overcome by Hamilton\r\nthe energetic, and Dr. Patterson's wife \"took her up\" for the occasion\r\nin a delightfully patronizing manner. The four swarthy, polite\r\nOrientals were there, of course; several other ladies in addition to\r\nMrs. Patterson and Nahèmah, the chief officer, myself, Hamilton, and a\r\nsepulchral Scotch curate, the Rev. Mr. Rawlingson, whom I had scarcely\r\nnoticed hitherto, and whose presence at this \"select\" gathering rather\r\nsurprised me.\r\n\r\nThe sea was like a sheet of glass, and this was the hottest day which\r\nI had yet experienced. It was about an hour before lunch-time when we\r\ngathered to view the diamond; and Mr. Brodie, the chief officer,\r\nexercised his pawky humor in a series of elaborate pantomimic\r\nprecautions, locking the door with labored care, and treating the\r\nladies of the company to Bluebeard glances of frightful intensity.\r\n\r\nPhew! if we had only known!...\r\n\r\nFinally one of the Indians took out the diamond from its case--which\r\nhad been brought from the strong-room a few minutes before. It was a\r\nwonderful thing, I suppose, of quite unusual size, and it sparkled and\r\ngleamed in the sunlight streaming through the open porthole in an\r\nabsolutely dazzling fashion. I had ranged myself close beside Nahèmah.\r\nEach of us was permitted to handle the stone. It was I who passed it\r\nto her, Mr. Rawlingson having passed it to me. She held it in the palm\r\nof her little hand, and her eyes sparkled with childish delight as she\r\nbent to examine the gem. Then a very strange thing happened.\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere behind me--I was sitting with my back to the\r\nporthole--a dull gray object came leaping and twirling; and a\r\nscorpion--I have never seen a larger specimen--fell upon Nahèmah's\r\nwrist!\r\n\r\nShe uttered a piercing cry, dropped the diamond and brushed the horrid\r\ninsect from her wrist; then fell swooning into my arms....\r\n\r\nA scene of incredible confusion followed. The four Indians, ignoring\r\nthe presence of the scorpion, dropped like cats upon the floor,\r\nseeking for Lure of Souls. Mrs. Patterson and I carried Nahèmah to\r\nthe sofa hard by and laid her upon it. Just as we did so the scorpion\r\ndarted from between the end of the sofa and the wardrobe, and the\r\nchief officer put his foot upon it.\r\n\r\nEnsuing events were indescribable. Since the diamond had not yet been\r\npicked up, obviously the cabin door could not be unlocked; so in the\r\nstuffy atmosphere of the place it was a matter of some difficulty to\r\nrevive Nahèmah. Meanwhile, four wild-eyed Indians were creeping about\r\namongst our feet--like cats, as I have said before.\r\n\r\nIn the end, just as the girl began to revive somewhat, it became\r\nevident that Lure of Souls was missing. A pearl shirt button, the\r\nownership of which we were unable to establish, was picked up, but no\r\ndiamond.\r\n\r\nThe chief officer showed himself a man of priceless tact. He rang for\r\nthe stewardess, and the ladies were shepherded to a neighboring,\r\nvacant cabin. Then the door was relocked, and Mr. Brodie proceeded to\r\nstrip, placing his garments one by one upon the little folding table\r\nfor examination. He was not satisfied until every man present had\r\noverhauled them. We all followed his example, the Rev. Mr. Rawlingson\r\nlast of all ... and Lure of Souls was still on the missing list!\r\n\r\nThen we gave the chief officer's cabin such a turnout as it had never\r\nhad before, I should assume. Our quest was unrewarded. Meanwhile, the\r\nladies had been submitted to a similar search in the adjoining cabin;\r\nsame result.\r\n\r\nWith great difficulty we succeeded in hushing up the matter to a\r\ncertain extent; but the captain's language to the chief officer was\r\nappalling, and the chief officer's remarks to Hamilton were equally\r\nunparliamentary; whilst Hamilton seemed to consider that he was\r\njustified in placing the whole blame upon me, which he did in terms\r\nlittle short of insulting. The four Indians apparently regarded all\r\nof us with equal suspicion and animosity.\r\n\r\nI could not foresee the end. The thing was so sudden, so serious, that\r\nat the time it banished even thoughts of Nahèmah from my mind. I\r\nanticipated that we should all find ourselves arrested when we reached\r\nPort Said.\r\n\r\nLater in the day Hamilton walked into my cabin and placed a little\r\ncardboard box upon the dressing-table. It contained the crushed body\r\nof the scorpion.\r\n\r\n\"Where did that scorpion come from?\" he demanded abruptly.\r\n\r\nIt was a question which already had been asked fully a thousand times,\r\nyet no one had discovered an intelligent reply.\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\"It came from the open porthole,\" he replied, \"and as it's a thousand\r\nto one against a scorpion being aboard, somebody was _carrying_ it for\r\nthis very purpose--somebody who was on the deck outside the chief\r\nofficer's cabin _and who threw the scorpion_ into the cabin.\"\r\n\r\n\"But such a deadly thing....\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a good look,\" said Hamilton, turning the insect over with a\r\nlead pencil; \"this one isn't deadly at all. See!--his tail has been\r\ncut off!\"\r\n\r\nI looked and stifled an exclamation. It was as Hamilton had said. The\r\nscorpion was harmless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI never once set eyes upon Nahèmah again until we arrived at Port\r\nSaid. Then I saw her preparing to go ashore in one of the boats. I\r\nmanaged to join her, ignoring the scowls of her one-eyed attendant,\r\nand we arrived at the quay together. Right there by the water's edge\r\na most curious scene was being enacted. Surrounded by two or three\r\npassengers and a perfect ring of uniformed officials, Hamilton, very\r\nexcited, watched his baggage being turned out upon the ground. He saw\r\nme approaching.\r\n\r\n\"Hang it all, Fane,\" he cried, \"this is disgraceful!--I don't know\r\nupon whose orders they are acting, but the beastly police are\r\nsearching my baggage for the diamond....\"\r\n\r\nI thought it very extraordinary and said as much to the Rev. Mr.\r\nRawlingson, who was one of the onlookers.\r\n\r\n\"It is very strange indeed,\" he said mildly, turning his gold-rimmed\r\nspectacles in my direction.\r\n\r\nA moment later, to my horror and indignation, Nahèmah was submitted to\r\nthe same indignity! The crowd had been roped off from the part of the\r\nquay upon which we stood, and I could see that the whole thing had\r\nbeen arranged beforehand in some way, probably by wireless from the\r\nship. Curiously, as I thought at the time, my own baggage was not\r\nexamined in this way, but I was detained long enough to lose sight of\r\nNahèmah and her one-eyed guardian. When I got to the hotel I indulged\r\nin some reflection. It occurred to me that Hamilton was bound for\r\nColombo, which made it rather singular that he should have had his\r\nbaggage put ashore at Port Said.\r\n\r\nI should have liked to have searched the town for my lady of the\r\n_yashmak_, but having no clue to her present whereabouts, realized\r\nthe futility of such a proceeding. My last thought before I fell\r\nasleep that night was that some day in the near future I should\r\nvisit Damascus.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nI saw very little of Port Said, for we had arrived in the early\r\nmorning and I was departing for Cairo by a train leaving shortly\r\nbefore midday. I wandered about the quaint streets a bit, however,\r\nand wondered if, from one of the latticed windows overhanging me,\r\nthe dark eyes of Nahèmah were peering out.\r\n\r\nAlthough I looked up and down the train fairly carefully, I failed to\r\nfind among the passengers anyone whom I knew, and I settled down into\r\nmy corner to study the novel scenery uninterruptedly. The shipping in\r\nthe canal fascinated me for a long time as did the figures which moved\r\nupon its shores. The ditches and embankments, aimlessly wandering\r\nfootpaths, and moving figures which seemed to belong to a thousand\r\nyears ago, seized upon my imagination as they seize upon the\r\nimagination of every traveller when first he beholds them.\r\n\r\nBut, properly speaking, my story jumps now to Zagazig. The train\r\nstopped at Zagazig; and, walking out into the corridor and lowering a\r\nwindow, I was soon absorbed in contemplation of that unique town. Its\r\nnarrow, dirty, swarming streets; the millions of flies that boarded\r\nthe train; the noisy vendors of sugar cane, tangerine oranges and\r\nother commodities; the throng beyond the barriers gazing open-mouthed\r\nat me as I gazed open-mouthed at them--it was a first impression, but\r\nan indelible one.\r\n\r\nI was not to know it was written that I should spend the night in\r\nZagazig; but such was the case. Generally speaking, I have found the\r\nservice on the Egyptian State Railway very good, but a hitch of some\r\nkind occurred on this occasion, and after an hour or so of delay, it\r\nwas definitely announced to the passengers that owing to an accident\r\nto the permanent way, the journey to Cairo could not be continued\r\nuntil the following morning.\r\n\r\nThen commenced a rush which I did not understand at first, and in\r\nwhich, feeling no desire to exert myself unduly, I did not\r\nparticipate. Half an hour later I ascertained that the only two hotels\r\nwhich the place boasted were full to overflowing, and realized what\r\nthe rush had meant. It was all part of the great scheme of things, no\r\ndoubt; but when, thanks to the kindly, if mercenary, offices of the\r\nInternational Sleeping Car attendant, I found myself in possession of\r\na room at a sort of native _khân_ in the lower end of the town, I\r\nexperienced no very special gratitude towards Providence.\r\n\r\nI have enjoyed the hospitality of less pleasing caravanserai since,\r\nbut this was my first experience of the kind, and I thought very\r\nlittle of it.\r\n\r\nMy room boasted a sort of bed, certainly, but without entering into\r\ndetails, I may say that there were earlier occupants who disputed its\r\npossession. The plaster of the walls--the place apparently was built\r\nof a mixture of straw and dried mud--provided residence not only for\r\nmosquitoes, but also for ants, and the entire building was redolent\r\nof an odor suggestive of dried bones. That smell of dried bones is\r\ncharacteristic, I have learned, of the sites of ancient Egyptian\r\ncities (Zagazig is close to the ruins of ancient Bubastis, of course);\r\none gets it in the temples and the pyramids, also. But it was novel to\r\nme, then, and not pleasing.\r\n\r\nI killed time somehow or other until the dinner hour; and the train,\r\nwhich now reposed in a siding, became a rendezvous for those who\r\ndesired to patronize the dining-car. Evidently no sleeping-cars were\r\navailable (or perhaps that idea was beyond the imagination of the\r\nnative officials), and having left a trail of tobacco smoke along the\r\nprincipal native street, I turned into my apartment which I shared\r\nwith the ants, mosquitoes--and the other things.\r\n\r\nAn examination of my rooms by candle-light revealed the presence of a\r\ncupboard, or what I thought to be a cupboard, but opening the double\r\ndoors I saw that it was a window, latticed and overlooking a lower\r\napartment; so much I perceived by the light of an oil lamp which stood\r\nupon the table. Then, stifling a gasp of amazement, I hastily snuffed\r\nmy candle and peered down eagerly at that incredible scene....\r\n\r\nNahèmah, longer veiled, was sitting at the table, and opposite to her\r\nwas seated the hideous wall-eyed attendant!\r\n\r\nThey were conversing in low tones, so that, strive as I would, I could\r\nnot overhear a word. You ask me why I spied upon the lady's privacy in\r\nthis manner? For a very good reason.\r\n\r\nMidway between the two, upon the rough boards of the table, lay Lure\r\nof Souls, twinkling and glittering like a thing of incarnate light.\r\n\r\nI observed that there was a door to the room below, almost immediately\r\nopposite the window through which I was peering ... and this door was\r\nopening very slowly and noiselessly. At least, _I_ could hear no\r\nnoise, but the one-eyed man detected something, for suddenly he\r\nstarted up and did a remarkable thing. Snatching up the diamond from\r\nthe table, he clapped it into the eyeless cavity of his skull and\r\nturned in a twinkling to face the intruder.\r\n\r\nThen the door was thrown open, and Hamilton leapt into the room.\r\n\r\nI could scarcely credit my senses. Honestly, I thought I was dreaming.\r\nHamilton's whole face was changed: a hard, cunning look had come over\r\nit, and he held a revolver in his hand. Nahèmah sprang to her feet as\r\nhe entered, but he covered the pair of them with his revolver, and\r\npointing to the one-eyed man muttered something in a low voice. Rage,\r\nfear, rebellion chased in turn across the evil features of One-eye;\r\nbut there was something about Hamilton's manner that cowed.\r\n\r\nManipulating the sunken eyelids as though they had been of rubber,\r\nthe guardian of the veiled lady slipped the diamond into the palm\r\nof his hand and tossed it, glittering, on to the table.\r\n\r\nHamilton's expression of triumph I shall never forget. One step\r\nforward he took and was about to snatch up the gem when--out of the\r\ndark cavity of the doorway behind him stepped a second intruder.\r\n\r\nIt was the Rev. Mr. Rawlingson!\r\n\r\nThe reverend gentleman's behavior was most unclerical. He leapt upon\r\nthe unsuspecting Hamilton like a panther and screwed the muzzle of a\r\nrevolver into that gentleman's right ear with quite unnecessary vigor.\r\n\r\n\"You have been wasting your time, Farland!\" he snapped in a voice that\r\nwas quite new to me. \"That is, unless you have turned amateur\r\ndetective.\"\r\n\r\nHe made no attempt to reach for the diamond, but just held out his\r\nhand, and with his eyes fixed upon Hamilton, silently commanded the\r\nlatter to hand over the gem. This Hamilton did with palpable\r\nreluctance. Mr. Rawlingson, who, though still clerically garbed, had\r\ndiscarded his spectacles, slipped the stone into his pocket, snatched\r\nthe revolver from Hamilton's hand and jerked his thumb in the\r\ndirection of the open door. Hamilton shrugged his shoulders and walked\r\nout of the room. For scarce a moment did Rawlingson's eyes turn to\r\nfollow the retreating figure, but the chance was good enough for the\r\nwall-eyed man.\r\n\r\nHe launched himself through space like nothing so much as a kangaroo,\r\nbearing Rawlingson irresistibly to the floor! With his lean hands at\r\nthe other's throat he turned his solitary eye upon Nahèmah, muttering\r\nsomething gutturally. After a moment's hesitation she ran from the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwenty seconds later I was downstairs, and ten seconds after that was\r\nhelping Rawlingson to his feet. He was considerably shaken and boasted\r\na very elegant design in bruises which was just beginning to reveal\r\nitself upon his throat; but otherwise he was unhurt.\r\n\r\n\"I have lost her, Mr. Fane!\" were his first words. \"She knows this\r\npart of the world inside out. I have no case against Farland, but I\r\nam sorry to have lost the woman.\"\r\n\r\nWas my mind in a whirl? Did I think that madness had seized me?\r\nReplies both in the affirmative; I was simply staggered.\r\n\r\nI always go to pieces with this part of the yarn, being an unpractised\r\nnarrator, as I have already explained; but I may relieve your mind\r\nupon one point. I never saw Nahèmah and the one-eyed man again, nor\r\nhave I since set eyes upon Hamilton. Mr. Rawlingson, the last time I\r\nheard from him, was in similar case.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the whole thing was something of a blow to me, of\r\ncourse. The lily of Damascus who had fascinated me so hopelessly was\r\nno Eastern at all; you will have guessed as much. She was a\r\nFrenchwoman, I believe; at any rate they had a long record up against\r\nher in Paris. She had gone out after Lure of Souls, and very\r\ningeniously had made me her instrument. As Mr. Rawlingson explained\r\nto me, what had probably taken place was this:\r\n\r\nThe harmless scorpion, specially brought along for some such purpose,\r\nhad been thrown into the chief officer's cabin from the open porthole\r\nby the one-eyed villain. That had been the cue for Nahèmah to drop the\r\nshirt button, and, whilst the occupants of the cabin were in\r\nconfusion, to toss the diamond out on to the deck where her accomplice\r\nwas waiting. The search of their effects had been futile, of course;\r\nno one had thoughts of searching the eye-cavity of her Eastern\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nWhere did Hamilton come in? Hamilton was one James Farland, an\r\nAmerican crook of the highest accomplishments, known to the police of\r\nthe entire civilized world. He, too, had gone out for Lure of Souls,\r\nbut the woman, his professional competitor, had proved too clever for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Rawlingson? He was Detective-Inspector Wexford of New\r\nScotland Yard. Yes, it's a rotten story, from a romantic point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET OF ISMAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nMustapha Mirza knew it--Mustapha Mirza, the blind Persian who makes\r\nshoes hard by the Bâb ez-Zuwêla and in the very shadow of the minarets\r\nof Muayyâd; Hassan es-Sîwa of the Street of the Carpet-sellers in the\r\nMûski, Hassan, who, where another man has hands, has but hideous\r\nstumps, knew it, and because of him it was that Abdûl Moharli sought\r\nit--Abdûl the mendicant who crouches on the steps of the Blue Mosque\r\nmuttering, guttural, inarticulate, and pointing to the tongueless\r\ncavity of his mouth. Now I know it; but not from Abdûl Moharli: may\r\nAllah, the Great, the Compassionate, defend me!\r\n\r\nI say \"May Allah defend me,\" yet I am no Moslem; I have no spot of\r\nEgyptian blood in my veins. No, I am a pure Greek of Cos, of Cos the\r\nhome of the loveliest women in the world; and my mother was one of\r\nthese, whilst my father was a Cretan, and a true descendent of Minos.\r\nMy story perhaps will not be believed, for always it has been my fate\r\nto be maligned. You will ask, perhaps, what I was doing in the Mâzi\r\nDesert between Beni Suêf and the Red Sea, but I reply that my cotton\r\ninterests--for I have cotton interests in the Delta--often lead me\r\nfar afield. You do not understand the cotton industry or this\r\nexplanation would be unnecessary. It is only those who do not\r\nunderstand the cotton industry that speak of _hashish_. _Hashish!_\r\nI leave it to the Egyptians and the Jews to deal in _hashish_; I am\r\nneither a Jew nor an Egyptian, but a Greek of Cos, who would not soil\r\nhis hands with such a trade--no.\r\n\r\nUpon my business, then, my legitimate business, I found myself with\r\na small company of servants encamped by the Wâdi Araba. At the Wâdi\r\nAraba I had a commercial acquaintance, a sheikh of the Mâzi Arabs.\r\nThose villains who say that he was a \"go-between,\" that my business\r\nwas not with him, but through him with a port of the Red Sea, dare not\r\nsay as much to my face; for there is a law in the land--even in the\r\nland of Egypt, now that the British hold power here.\r\n\r\nI had reached the point, then, whereat it was my custom to meet my\r\nbusiness acquaintance and to discuss certain affairs in which we were\r\ninterested. My servants had erected the tent in which I was to sleep,\r\nand the camels lay in a little limestone valley to the west, their\r\neyes mild because they knew that the day's work was ended; for it is\r\na foolish mistake to suppose that the eye of a camel is mild at any\r\nother time. The camel knows the secret name of Allah--and that name is\r\nRest.\r\n\r\nThe violet after-glow, which is the most wonderful thing in Nature,\r\ncrowned the desert with glory right away to the porphyry mountains.\r\nI stood at my tent door looking westward to the Nile. I stood looking\r\nout upon the waste of the sands, the eternal sands which are a belt\r\nabout Egypt; and my thoughts running fleetly before me, crossed the\r\ndesert, crossed the Nile, and came to rest in the verdant, fertile\r\nFàyûm, its greenness sweet to look upon in the heat of such an\r\nevening, its palms fashioned in ebony black against the wondrous sky.\r\nYes, I, who am a Greek, love the Fàyûm more than any spot on earth;\r\nthe modern clamor and dust of Cairo are hateful to me, although my\r\nbusiness often takes me there, and also to Alexandria, the most\r\nEuropean city in the East, and to me the most detestable. But my\r\nbusiness is in the Delta and it is a good business, so why should\r\nI complain?\r\n\r\nI stood at my tent door, and I thought of many things, though little\r\nof the matters which had brought me there; a faint cool breeze fanned\r\nmy brow, and about me was that great peace which comes to Egypt with\r\nthe touch of night. My servants were silent in their encampment, and\r\nthe shrieking of the camels had ceased. About me, then, all was\r\nsleeping; only I was awake, only I was there to receive Abdûl Moharli\r\nand his secret--the secret of Ismail.\r\n\r\nBy the pattering of his bare feet upon the sand, I first learned of\r\nhis coming, but for a long time I could not see him, for his way led\r\nhim through the valley where the camels slept, and a mound obscured\r\nmy view. But presently I heard his panting breaths and his little\r\ndelirious cries of fear, which were like sobs, and presently, again,\r\nI saw him staggering over the slope. At the sight of me he uttered one\r\nlast gasping cry and fell forward on his face unconscious--like a dead\r\nman.\r\n\r\nI hurried to him, stooped and raised him. His face was dreadful to\r\nlook upon. His eyes were sunken in his skull, and his flesh shrivelled\r\nas by long fasting. His beard was filthy, knotted and unkempt, and his\r\nhair a black mat streaked with dirty gray. He was thin as a mummy and\r\nthe bones protruded through his skin. He was as one who is dying from\r\nexcess of _hashish_.\r\n\r\nAh! I know how they look, those poor fools who poison themselves with\r\nthe Indian hemp. I wonder Allah does not strike down the villain who\r\nplaces that poison within their reach. I use the term \"Allah\" because\r\nmy business brings me much in contact with the natives, but I am no\r\nMoslem, as I have related. Father Pierre of Alexandria can tell you\r\nhow devoted a Christian I am.\r\n\r\nDrink and food revived him somewhat; and as I sat beside him in my\r\ntent that night he babbled to me, half deliriously; he raved, and to\r\nanother it might have seemed the fancies of a poor madman which he\r\npoured into my ears. For he spoke of a secret oasis and of a sheikh\r\nwho had lived since the days of Sultan Kalaûn; of a treasure vast as\r\nthat of Suleyman--and of magic, black magic; of the transmuting of\r\ngold and the making of diamonds.\r\n\r\nBut I, who am a Greek, and one who has lived all his life between\r\nAlexandria and the Red Sea; I who know the Garden of Egypt as another\r\nknows the palm of his hand--I detected in this delirium the shadow of\r\na truth. To me it became evident that this wretched being who had\r\nfled, a hunted thing, over the trackless desert for many days and\r\nnights--it became evident to me, I say, that he spoke of the far-famed\r\nsecret of Ismail.\r\n\r\nYou would ask: What is the secret of Ismail? I would tell you, ask it\r\nof Hassan the Handless, of Mustapha, the blind Persian of the Bâb\r\nez-Zuwêla; better still, ask it of any son of the Fàyûm, of any man of\r\nthe Mâzi. None of them will answer you, for none save Hassan and\r\nMustapha knows the strange truth--Hassan and Mustapha, and Abdûl\r\nMoharli ... and no one of these three knows all, nor will reveal what\r\nhe knows.\r\n\r\nAh! how my heart leapt and how my eyes must have gleamed in the\r\ndarkness of the tent, yet how cold a fear clutched at the life within\r\nme. The night seemed suddenly to become a thin curtain veiling eyes\r\nthat watched, the empty desert a hiding-place for unseen multitudes\r\nthat listened; the faint breeze raising the flap of the tent, ever so\r\ngently, ever so softly, assumed the shape of a malignant hand that\r\nreached for my throat, that sought to stifle me ere the secret, the\r\ndeathly secret of Ismail should be mine.\r\n\r\nAbdûl Moharli was the name of this wanderer; and as he spoke to me,\r\ngulping down great draughts of water between the words, ever he\r\nglanced to right and left, over his shoulder and all about him.\r\n\r\n\"It is four days from here,\" he whispered hoarsely; \"due south in the\r\ndirection of the porphyry quarries and the Mountain of Smoke. There\r\nis a tiny village and all the inhabitants are of the race of Saïd Ebn\r\nal As, being descendants of the companion of the prophet. I had long\r\nsupposed that this race of heretics was extinct; but it is not so, O\r\nmy benefactor; with these eyes, have I seen the houses wherein they\r\ndwell. By the strategy of which I have spoken did I penetrate to their\r\nsecret dwelling-place and win their unsuspecting love.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, clutching me to him with his bony hands, he spoke in hushed\r\nand fearful tones of the house of the Sheikh Ismail Ebn al As. It was\r\nthe fabled treasure of this holy man which had been the lodestone\r\ndrawing Abdûl Moharli out into the desert. Something of his fear, of\r\nhis constant apprehension seized upon me too; and as he glanced\r\ntremblingly first over this shoulder and then over that, so likewise\r\ndid _I_ glance, until I seemed to crouch in a world of spies listening\r\nto a secret greater than that of the Universe.\r\n\r\nI pronounced the _Takbîr_, \"Great is the Lord!\"--a superstitious\r\ncustom which I have acquired from my business acquaintances. I made\r\nthe sign of the Cross and called upon the name of the Holy Virgin.\r\nAlmost I feared to listen further, yet I lacked the courage to\r\nabstain.\r\n\r\n\"Not with mine eyes have I beheld the treasure of Ismail,\" he\r\nwhispered to me, this shadow of a man, this living mummy, those same\r\neyes rolling in their sunken sockets; \"nor with mine ears have I\r\nheard it named. These hands have never touched it; yet the secret of\r\nIsmail is _my_ secret.\"\r\n\r\nSo far he had proceeded and no further, when a slight noise, that was\r\nnot of my imagination, came from immediately outside the tent. On the\r\ninstant I sprang forth ... but no one was there and nothing now\r\ndisturbed the solitude of the desert about me. A moment I stood,\r\npeering to left and right, into the void of the velvet dusk; no more\r\nthan a moment, I can swear, yet long enough for that dreadful thing\r\nto happen--that thing which sometimes haunts my dreams.\r\n\r\nShrill and awful upon the silence it burst; the scream of a stricken\r\nman. It stabbed me like a knife; and as a creature of clay I stood,\r\nunable to stir or think. It died away, in a long wail of pain, that\r\ngave place to a guttural, inarticulate babbling--a choking, sobbing\r\nsound indescribable, but that may not be forgotten once it has been\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nNo living thing, as I can testify, entered or left the tent; so far\r\nthe evidence of my senses bears me. But that one had entered and left\r\nit, unseen, I learned, when, throwing off this palsy of horror, I\r\nstaggered back to the side of the one who knew the secret of Ismail.\r\n\r\nHe lay writhing upon the ground; blood issued from his mouth. The\r\ntongue of Abdûl Moharli had been torn out!\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThree weeks later I had my first sight of the secret oasis. The fate\r\nfrom which Abdûl had fled had overtaken him as I have related, in my\r\ntent, and from that moment until we parted company--for this poor\r\nwretch survived his mutilation--not another hint could I glean from\r\nhim respecting the discovery for which he had paid so terrible a\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he lacked the accomplishment of writing and in\r\nthe second place his fear of the vengeance of Ismail had become a\r\nveritable madness. I left him at Beni Suêf, filled with a\r\ndetermination to probe this mystery for myself. Suitably prepared for\r\nsuch an undertaking I set out alone from Dér Byâd, and undertook the\r\nfour days' journey which I had planned.\r\n\r\nIn a little gorge, arid, shadeless, in which only a few stunted\r\ntamarisks grew, but affording a sort of hiding-place for myself and\r\nmy camel, I made my base of operations. Provisions of a sort I had\r\nplenty, but for water I must depend on the secret oasis, which I\r\nestimated to be not more than four miles distant. In the dead of night\r\nI set out, making for a series of mounds or hillocks rising up from\r\nthe rocky face of the plateau. Cautiously I ascended their slopes,\r\never watchful and with eagerly beating heart; and it was lying prone\r\nupon the crest of the greatest of these that I first saw the village\r\nand the oasis.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing extraordinary in the appearance of the village; it\r\npresented to the eye the usual group of small, squat houses clinging\r\nto the trunks of the palm trees and surrounding a shrine or mosque\r\nboasting a wooden minaret. There were tilled fields and palm groves\r\nto the left of the village and a large house surrounded by white walls\r\nembracing extensive gardens. My spirits rose high. Within that house\r\nlay the secret of Ismail.\r\n\r\nI determined to approach from the left, where I should be able to\r\ntake advantage of the far-cast shadows of the palm groves and of\r\nthe direction of the faint breeze; for most of all I feared the dogs,\r\nwithout which no Arab village is complete. Sure enough, although I\r\nhad elected to approach the left of the village and although I crawled\r\nlaboriously upon hands and knees, the accursed brutes apparently\r\nscented me or heard me and made night hideous with their clamor.\r\n\r\nFlat upon the ground I lay, awaiting the dogs who bore down upon me\r\nsnarling, their fangs bared. I had come prepared for this; but,\r\nmysteriously, at a point by the end of the palm grove and some twenty\r\nyards away from me, the pack halted, and after a time became silent.\r\nThis was unaccountable but fortunate; and after waiting a while longer\r\nto learn if anyone had been aroused by the outcry, I advanced towards\r\nthe wall of the garden, passing stealthily from palm to palm.\r\n\r\nI observed that the mosque was a more important building than I had\r\nsupposed, with a tomb on the right of the entrance surmounted by a\r\nwhite dome. A passage leading to the courtyard, which presented a\r\ncharming picture in the moonlight, its fountain overshadowed by\r\nacacias, reminded me very much of that in the Mosque of Muayyâd in\r\nCairo. As in the latter, a double arcade surrounded it on three sides\r\nand the columns were of some kind of marble and sculptured with\r\ninscriptions in Arabic. I had a glimpse of a blue-tiled sanctuary,\r\nthrough a fine _mushrabîyeh_ screen beneath the pointed arches.\r\nArabesques in colored glass rendered the windows very beautiful to\r\nlook upon. Nothing stirred within the village, as I crept along the\r\nnarrow lane separating the mosque from the wall of the garden. Beyond\r\nprospecting the ground, I had no definite plans for to-night; but Fate\r\nhad willed it that I was to become more deeply involved in the affair\r\nthan I had designed or intended.\r\n\r\nA side door opened from the garden at a spot nearly opposite the\r\nlittle wooden platform which served as the minaret of the mosque; and\r\nthe mud bricks of the porch were so broken and decayed by time that I\r\nperceived here an opportunity of mounting to the top of the wall, an\r\nopportunity of which I instantly availed myself.\r\n\r\nYes, in spite of my peaceful calling (I have explained that I have\r\ncotton interests in the Delta) my life has not been unadventurous nor\r\nhave I ever hesitated to incur risk where profit might be gained.\r\nTherefore, having climbed to the top of the wall, unmolested, and\r\nperceiving at a spot some little distance to the right a sort of\r\ntrellis overgrown with purple blossom, I did not hesitate to make for\r\nit and to descend into the garden. I had just completed the descent,\r\nand stood looking cautiously about me, when a sound disturbed the\r\nsilence--a sound so entirely unexpected, in that place, at such an\r\nhour, that it turned my blood cold, bringing to my mind all those\r\nstories of the black magic for which the people of this oasis were\r\nfamed.\r\n\r\nIt was the sound of a woman singing; and although the song she sang\r\nwas a familiar Arab love song and the voice of the singer was sweet,\r\nif very mournful, the effect, as I have said, was weird to a degree.\r\n\r\n    _Ashik yekul l'il hammám hát le genáhak yom_\r\n    (A lover said to a dove, \"Lend me your wings for a day,\" etc.)\r\n\r\nOvercoming the fear and astonishment which momentarily had deprived\r\nme of action, I advanced with the utmost caution in the direction from\r\nwhence this mysterious singing seemed to proceed. Passing an angle of\r\nthe house, where the stucco wall ran sheerly up to a _mushrabîyeh_\r\nwindow, I perceived before me a smaller, detached building in the form\r\nof a sort of pavilion. Some fine acacias overhung its white and\r\nglistening dome, in which were little windows of colored glass.\r\nConcealed in the shadow of the house, I stood looking towards this\r\nsmaller building, observing with astonishment that it possessed a\r\nmassive, bronze-mounted door.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in many respects, and in spite of the charming picture which\r\nits jeweled appearance presented, it might well have been the tomb of\r\nsome holy Sheikh. But seated on an old-fashioned _mastabah_ before\r\nthe entrance were two huge negroes of most ferocious aspect, armed\r\nwith scimitars which glittered evilly in the light of the moon!\r\n\r\nI drew back sharply into the shelter of the projecting wall. One of\r\nthe negroes seemed to slumber, but the wicked black eyes of his\r\ncompanion were widely open and he revealed his ivory teeth in a\r\nfrightful leer. The beating of my heart almost suffocated me, for I\r\nascribed that ghastly grimace to the fact that the negro had detected\r\nmy presence and was already gloating over the pleasing prospect of my\r\nswift and bloody despatch. For many agonized moments I lurked there,\r\none hand clutching the stucco wall and the other resting upon the butt\r\nof a new Colt magazine pistol which I had taken the precaution to\r\npurchase in Alexandria a week earlier.\r\n\r\nWhen again I ventured to protrude my head, I learned how groundless\r\nmy fears had been; I realized that the loathsome contortion of the\r\nnegro's countenance represented a smile of appreciation. He was\r\nlistening to the unseen singer whose voice now stole again upon the\r\nsilence of the night! His blubber lips drooped open cavernously and\r\nhis fierce little eyes blinked in stupid rapture.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me, now, that the sweet voice proceeded from some\r\nsubterranean place: I thought that I was listening to the song of a\r\n_ginneyeh_. I remembered how the Sheikh Ismail was reputed to be the\r\nson of an _Efreet_ and an Arabian princess, and to have lived in that\r\noasis for generations, since the reign of the Sultan Mohammed Nâsir\r\nibn-Kalaûn, who had expelled him from Cairo as a magician. He was said\r\nto possess the secrets of Geber and of Avicenna--the great Ibn Sina of\r\nBokhara; to possess the Philosophers' Stone and the _Elixir Vitæ_. In\r\nthis pavilion with the bronze door I beheld the magician's\r\ntreasure-house, guarded, within, by a _ginneyeh_ and, without, by\r\nghouls or black _Efreets_!\r\n\r\nYou will understand that these childish superstitions sometimes\r\novercome me, because I have lived so long among those who believe\r\nthem; but to me, a Greek, possessing the consolation of the true\r\nreligion, it was only momentary, this cold fear which belongs to\r\nignorance and is bred in the blood of the Moslem but finds no place\r\nin the heart of a true Christian.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Fates again took a hand in the game. The pack of curs in\r\nthe distant palm grove set up a sudden tempest of sound, so that they\r\nseemed to have become possessed of a million devils. It was a\r\ndisturbance infinitely louder and more prolonged than that with which\r\nthe dogs had greeted my appearance, and I had barely time to throw\r\nmyself flat in the depths of a black and friendly shadow ere the two\r\nnegroes, monstrous in the moonlight, passed me silently and trotted\r\noff in the direction from whence the uproar proceeded. You will say,\r\nno doubt, that a madness as great as that of the dogs possessed me;\r\nbut because what I tell you is true, you must not be surprised to find\r\nit strange.\r\n\r\nAllowing the negroes time to reach the gate for which I divined them\r\nto be making, I ran across the moon-bathed garden to the door of the\r\npavilion.\r\n\r\nYou must understand that my madness was not entirely without method;\r\nfor I had a vague plan in my mind: it was to ascertain the character\r\nof the lock upon the bronze door (for you must know that I am skilled\r\nin the craft of the locksmith), and then, passing beyond the pavilion,\r\nwhich I was assured was the treasure-house of Ismail, to make my\r\nescape over the garden wall at some point to the west and return to\r\nmy base in the desert ravine armed with a knowledge of the enemy's\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\nBut, as I have said, the Fates took a hand. The sweet-voiced singer\r\nceased her song as I approached the pavilion; and, at the moment that\r\nI set foot upon the lower step, her voice--by Allah! whose Name be\r\nexalted, it was sweet as honey!--addressed to me these words:\r\n\r\n\"O my master, at last thou art come! Here is the key! enter ere they\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst I stared blankly upward to the open lattice from whence the\r\ninvisible speaker thus addressed me, an antique key wrapped in a piece\r\nof perfumed silk, fell almost upon my head!\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nDazed though I was by the complete unexpectedness of this happening\r\nI doubt if I should have had the temerity to pursue the matter further\r\nthat night but for the sound of fleetly running footsteps of which at\r\nthis moment I became aware.\r\n\r\nMy escape was cut off! If I endeavored to pass around the pavilion in\r\naccordance with my original plan I should undoubtedly be perceived. My\r\nonly hope lay in accepting the invitation so singularly given. With\r\ntrembling hands I fitted the key to the cumbersome lock, opened the\r\ndoor, and entered the pavilion. My presence of mind had not completely\r\ndeserted me and before closing the door I withdrew the key.\r\n\r\nI found myself in a saloon of extraordinary magnificence, furnished\r\nwith mattresses covered with silk and lighted by hanging lamps and by\r\ncandles, and having at its upper end a couch of alabaster decorated\r\nwith pearls and canopied by curtains of satin peacock-blue. From a\r\ncarved wooden archway draped with cloth of gold there leaped forth a\r\ngirl of such surpassing loveliness that her image must forever reside\r\nin my heart together with those of the saints.\r\n\r\nConceive all the dark-eyed beauties of Oriental poetry, of Hafiz, of\r\nOmar, of Attâr, and from each distil the very essence of female\r\nloveliness; though you combine them all in one rapturous vision of\r\ndelight you will have conceived but a feeble shadow of shadows of this\r\nwondrous reality who now stood panting before me, her red lips parted\r\nand her bosom tumultuous.\r\n\r\nI think if the light in her eyes had been for me I could gladly have\r\ndied for her and found death sweet; but as her gaze met mine a\r\npitiful change took place in that lovely countenance. Her color fled\r\nand she swayed and almost fell.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she whispered, \"thou art not my beloved! O Allah! this is some\r\nsnare that Ismail hath set for my feet! Who art thou? who art thou?\"\r\n\r\nBut because of the excess of the loveliness of the speaker, from whom\r\nI could not remove my eyes, and because as I stood in that perfumed\r\napartment it seemed to me that I was no longer a real man, but a\r\nfigment of some _Efreet's_ dream, I found myself incapable of both\r\nspeech and action.\r\n\r\nYet I was speedily to know that the Fates, which had thrust me into\r\nthat saloon--nay, which had brought me across the desert to that\r\nsecret oasis--were not yet wearied of their sport.\r\n\r\nA soft call, a lover's signal (for no true Believer will whistle at\r\nnight, since to do so is to summon the evil _ginn_) sounded from\r\nimmediately outside the bronze door, followed by a muffled rapping\r\nupon the door itself!\r\n\r\n\"Saîd, my beloved!\" cried the girl wildly, and ran towards the door.\r\n\r\nAt that very moment, and whilst I stood there like a man of clay,\r\nI heard the negro guardians returning to their posts; I heard the\r\nclatter of their sandals and I heard their guttural cries of rage!\r\nUttering a long tremulous sigh, the beautiful occupant of the pavilion\r\nfell swooning upon the floor.\r\n\r\nA loud imperious voice now rose above the sounds of conflict which had\r\ncommenced outside the pavilion; I heard the sound of many running\r\nfeet, and--my blood turned to ice--that of a key being inserted in the\r\nlock of the bronze door! Power of action returned to me, though I\r\nconfess that I now grew sick with dread. Only one hiding-place was\r\npossible: the first I could reach.\r\n\r\nI leaped across the lovely form extended upon the floor and dropped,\r\nalmost choking with emotion, behind the alabaster couch. I had barely\r\ngained this cover when the door was hurled open and a tall,\r\nexcessively gaunt, and hawk-faced old man entered, his eyes blazing,\r\nhis thin nostrils quivering, and his lean hands opening and closing at\r\nhis sides in a sort of clutching movement horribly suggestive and\r\nterrifying.\r\n\r\nHe was followed by the two negroes, who were dragging between them a\r\nyoung Egyptian of prepossessing appearance down whose pale face blood\r\nwas pouring from a wound in the brow.\r\n\r\nSeveral other persons, principally servants of the _harêm_, brought\r\nup the rear.\r\n\r\nTowering over the recumbent body of the girl, the terrible old man--in\r\nwhom I could not fail to recognize the Sheikh Ismail--glared down at\r\nher for some moments in passionate silence; then he made as if to\r\nspurn her with his foot; then he clutched his long white beard with\r\nboth hands and plucked at it frenziedly, whilst tears began to course\r\ndown his furrowed cheeks, which had the frightful appearance of those\r\nof a mummy.\r\n\r\n\"O light of mine eyes!\" he exclaimed; \"O shame of my house! O\r\nreproach of my white hairs!\"\r\n\r\nHe recovered himself by dint of a stupendous effort and turning a\r\nfiery glance upon the captive:\r\n\r\n\"Cast him down upon the floor,\" he cried, \"that I may spit upon him,\r\nwho is a scorn among swine and the son of a disease!\"\r\n\r\nTo my unspeakable horror, the Sheikh then strode across the saloon and\r\nseated himself upon the alabaster couch! I almost choked with fear; I\r\nfelt my teeth beginning to chatter and the beating of my heart sounded\r\nin my ears like the throb of a _darâbukeh_. The Sheikh, fortunately\r\nignorant of my proximity, thus addressed the unfortunate young man who\r\nlay at his feet:\r\n\r\n\"Know, O disgrace of thy mother, that thy death hath been decided\r\nupon, and it shall visit thee in a most painful and unfortunate\r\nmanner. O thou spawn of offal, learn that I have been aware of thy\r\nmalevolent intentions since first thou didst seek to penetrate into my\r\nsecret. What! am I heir to all the wisdom of the ages, that I should\r\nremain ignorant of the presence of such as thee, O thou gnat's egg, in\r\nmy house? When the partner in thine infamy didst steal the key of the\r\ndoor from me, thinkest thou that mine eyes were blind to the theft, O\r\nthou foredoomed carrion? It was in order that thy culpability should\r\nbe made manifest that I permitted thee to enter. Thy double stratagem\r\nfor quelling and then exciting the dogs, in order that the guards\r\nmight be drawn from their posts, was known to me, and the negroes had\r\nreceived my orders to run to the gate in seeming accordance with\r\nthine accursed desires, O filthy insect!\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the time that this dreadful old man thus addressed his\r\nvictim, the latter crouched upon the floor, apparently paying no heed\r\nto his words but keeping an agonized glance fixed upon the lovely form\r\nof the girl. I was now in a condition of such profound and dejected\r\nfear as I had never known before and trust I may never know again. The\r\nSheikh continued:\r\n\r\n\"Learn of the fate of some of those who sought the secret of Ismail\r\nbefore thee. One there was, Mustapha Mirza, a Persian, who came hither\r\nto despoil me. With his eyes did he behold my treasure. To-day _he\r\nhath no eyes_! And there was one Hassan of the Khân Khalîl. He dared\r\nto lay violent hands upon the treasure of my house--the 'treasure' not\r\nof gold nor jewels but of fairest flesh and blood. To-day _he hath no\r\nhands_! Wouldst like to know of Abdûl Moharli, who learned much of\r\nthis \"secret\" of mine, and would have spoken of it? His tongue I threw\r\nto the carrion crows! _Thou_, O sink of iniquity, hast not only seen\r\nwith thine eyes, heard with thine ears and laid thy filthy hands upon\r\nthe treasure of Ismail: thou hast approached thy foul lips to this\r\npeach of Allah's garden! thou hast....\"\r\n\r\nHe choked in his utterance and seemed upon the point of hurling\r\nhimself upon the young man before him: but again he recovered his\r\ncomposure after a great effort and proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"The unpleasant punishments visited upon those others shall likewise\r\nfall to thy portion, since thou hast committed like crimes; but this\r\nshall only be in order to prepare thee for a most protracted and\r\npainful death. Bear him forth into the courtyard.\"\r\n\r\nAs one who dreams an evil dream, I saw the company stream out of the\r\nsaloon, the wretched prisoner in their midst. When at last the bronze\r\ndoor was reclosed and I found myself alone with the swooning girl, I\r\ncould scarce believe that even this respite was mine.\r\n\r\nI offered a prayer to St. Antony of the Thebäid--_my_ patron saint--as\r\nI listened to the sound of their receding footsteps; when I was\r\naroused from the lethargy of fear into which I had fallen by a distant\r\nscream--a long wailing cry....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have often asked myself: How did I make my escape from that dreadful\r\nvillage? You will remember that I had the purloined key of the bronze\r\ndoor in my possession? Then it was to this in the first place that I\r\nowed my preservation. To regain the garden was a simple matter, for\r\nthe Sheikh and his bloodthirsty following were engaged in the\r\ncourtyard of the house, but to St. Antony be all praise for the\r\ncircumstance that the little door opposite the mosque had been left\r\nopen--possibly by the unhappy Saïd,--and to St. Antony be all praise\r\nthat a second time I avoided the dogs....\r\n\r\nDawn found me staggering down into that friendly ravine which\r\nsheltered my camel. I was utterly exhausted, for I bore a burden, but\r\ntriumphant, delirious with joy and rapture, because my burden was so\r\nsweet. You may question me of these matters, and I shall reply: As well\r\nas my cotton interests I have now another interest in the Delta--the\r\nlovely \"Secret\" of the Sheikh Ismail Ebn al As![D]\r\n\r\n  [D] Readers of _Tales of Abû Tabâh_ will recognize Mizmûna,\r\n      \"The Lady of the Lattice,\" the story of whose recovery\r\n      by the bereaved Sheikh has already been related.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nHARÛN PASHA\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nI will tell you this story (said Ferrier of the Egyptian Civil) with\r\none reservation; comments are to be reserved for some future time. I\r\ncan only tell you what I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own\r\nears; I offer no explanation; I pass on the story; you can take it or\r\nleave it.\r\n\r\nSome of you will remember Dunlap--I don't mean Robert Dunlap, who is\r\nchief officer of the _Pekin_, but Jack Dunlap his cousin, the\r\nirrigation man who used to be stationed at Assuan.\r\n\r\nYou remember the build of the beggar?--the impression of scaffolding\r\nhis figure conveyed? I always used to think of him as an iron\r\nframework, and he had the most hard-bitten head-piece I have ever\r\nstruck; steel blue eyes and a mouth that was born shut. The dash of\r\nginger in his hair, complexion, and constitution made up a Scotch brew\r\nthat was very strongly flavored.\r\n\r\nHe came down to Cairo one spring, and a lot of us got together in the\r\nclub--on a Sunday night, I remember, it was. The conversation got\r\nalong that silly line; what we were all doing, and why we were doing\r\nit, what we had really intended to do, and how Fate had butted in and\r\nmade sailors of those that had meant to be parsons, engineers of the\r\npoets, and tramps of the chaps who had proposed to become financiers.\r\n\r\nWell, we had traveled up and down this blind alley for hours, I should\r\nthink, when Dunlap mounted on his hind legs and took the rug with the\r\nproposition that nothing--_nothing_--was impossible of achievement to\r\nthe man of single purpose. Someone put up an extreme case; asking\r\nDunlap how he should handle the business of the son of a respectable\r\ngreengrocer who, with singleness of purpose, proposed to become king\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nHe said it was not a fair case, but he accepted the challenge; and the\r\nway this junior greengrocer, under Dunlap's guidance, plunged into\r\npolitics, got elected M.P., wormed himself into the confidence of the\r\nentire Empire by a series of brilliant campaigns conducted from John\r\no' Groats to Van Diemen's Land; induced the reigning monarch, publicly,\r\nto advocate his own abdication; established a sort of commonwealth with\r\nhis ex-Majesty on the board and Dunlap occupying a post between that of\r\na protector and a Roman Cæsar--well, it was wonderful.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can judge of the lateness of the hour from the fact\r\nthat a group of moderately intelligent men tolerated, and contributed\r\nto, a chat of this nature. But what brings me down to the story is the\r\nfew words which I exchanged with Dunlap at the break-up of the party,\r\nwhen he was leaving.\r\n\r\nHis cousin Robert, as you know, is well on the rippity side; but Jack,\r\nwith all his fine capacity for heather-dew, had always struck me as\r\nsomething of a psalmster. I've heard that Bacchus holds the keys of\r\ntruth, and it may be right; for out on the steps of the club, I said\r\nto Jack Dunlap:\r\n\r\n\"It seems you don't practise what you preach?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't I?\" he snapped hardly. \"What do you suppose I am doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Engineering, I take it. Do you aspire to a pedestal beside De\r\nLesseps?\"\r\n\r\n\"De Lesseps be damned!\" he retorted sourly. \"Look at these.\"\r\n\r\nHe held out his hands, hardened with manual toil--the hands of a\r\ngrinder.\r\n\r\n\"Clearly you are a glutton for work,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I am aiming at never doing another hand's stroke in my life,\" he\r\nreplied, with an odd glint in his blue eyes. \"My idea of life--_life_,\r\nmind you, not mere existence--is to be a pasha--one of the old school,\r\nwith gate porters, orange trees, fountains, slaves, mosaic pavements,\r\na marble bath.\"\r\n\r\nHe mixed his ambitions oddly.\r\n\r\n\"Someone to do all the shifting for me, and even the thinking; to hold\r\na book in front of me if I wanted to read, to poke my pipe in my mouth,\r\nand to take it out when I wanted to blow smoke rings--and to _know_\r\nwhen I wanted it taken out without being told.\"\r\n\r\n\"On your showing, you are traveling by the wrong road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I?\" he snapped viciously. \"Just wait awhile.\"\r\n\r\nThat was all the indication I had of Dunlap's ideas, and remembering\r\nthe time of night and other circumstances, I did not count upon it\r\nworth a brass farthing; putting it down to the heather-dew rather than\r\nto any innate viciousness of the man. But listen to the sequel, which\r\nshifts us up just about twelve months, to the spring of the following\r\nyear, in fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI had seen no more of Dunlap, and concluded that he was back in\r\nAssuan, or somewhere on the river, foozling with his irrigation again.\r\nI never had the clearest conception of the work of his department, by\r\nthe way. An irrigation man once started to explain to me about his\r\nsection, mixing up surveying paraphernalia in his talk, telling me\r\nsomething about an allowance of half an inch variation in half a mile\r\nof bank, or chat to that effect; but I couldn't quite make it out. My\r\nimpression of Dunlap at business was very hazy; I pictured him\r\nmeasuring the bank of the Nile with a six-foot rule, and periodically\r\nkneeling down in the smelly mud to footle with a spirit-level. But he\r\nwas a Senior Wrangler, as you remember, and a man, too, of more\r\nsubstantial accomplishments, and he drew five hundred a year from the\r\nEgyptian Government; so that probably I underestimated his usefulness.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I had forgotten his iron framework and mahogany\r\ncountenance, together with his response (under the afflatus of\r\nheather-dew) at the time of which I am now speaking.\r\n\r\nA little matter had cropped up which touched me on a weak spot; and\r\nwith a mob of jabbering Egyptians and one very placid Bedouin flooding\r\nmy room, I found myself thinking again of Dunlap and envying him his\r\nintimate acquaintance with Arabic.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had been in the country quite twice as long as Dunlap, my\r\nArabic was far from perfect, for I have always been a rotten linguist.\r\nDunlap, as I now remembered, might have passed for a native (excepting\r\nhis Scottish headpiece), and I ascribed his proficiency to an inherent\r\ntrick of mimicry. There was something of the big ape about him; and\r\nafter one function at which we both were present, I remember how he\r\nconvulsed the entire club with an imitation of a certain highly placed\r\nEgyptian dignitary, voice and gesture being equal in comic effect to\r\nCyril Maude at his best. In fact, if you notice, you will find that\r\nthe best linguists, as a rule, have a marked apish streak in their\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nWell, here was I at my wits' ends to grasp twenty points of view at\r\none and the same time; no two expressed in quite the same dialect,\r\nand each orator more excited than another. You know the brutes?\r\n\r\nThat got me thinking of Dunlap, and even after the incident was\r\nclosed, I found myself thinking of him. Some friends from home were\r\nstaying at Shepheard's, and of course they had claimed me as dragoman;\r\nnot that I objected in the least, for one of the party--when it was\r\npossible to dodge her mother--was, well, a very agreeable companion,\r\nyou understand.\r\n\r\nOn this particular morning we were doing the bazaars. I have found by\r\ncomparison that the average tourist knows far more of the Mûski than\r\nthe average resident; in the same way, I suppose that for information\r\nregarding the Tower of London or the British Museum, one must go, not\r\nto a Cockney, but to an American visitor. At any rate, my party told\r\nme more than I could tell them, and my job degenerated into that of\r\na mere interpreter. In the matter of purchases, I possibly saved them\r\nmoney, but their knowledge of the wares was miles ahead of my own.\r\nThese up-to-date guide books must be very useful reading, I think.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had tried hard to rush them past that dangerous quarter,\r\nthe _Gôhargîya_, the ladies of the party had discovered a shop where\r\nlittle trays of loose gems, turquoises, rubies, bits of lapis-lazuli,\r\nand so forth, were displayed snarefully.\r\n\r\nAfter that I knew where I could find them up to any time before lunch;\r\nI knew they were safe enough for the rest of the morning; and accepting\r\nmy defeat at the hands of the jewel merchant who turned his slow eyes\r\nupon me and shrugged apologetically, I drifted off, after a decent\r\ninterval (leaving young Forrest, who, mysteriously, had turned up, to\r\ndo the cavalierly), intending to visit my acquaintance, Hassan, in the\r\n_Sûk el-Attârin_ (Street of the Perfumers), not twenty yards away.\r\n\r\nYou know Hassan? A large, mysterious figure in the shadows of his\r\nlittle shop, smoking amber-scented cigarettes as though he liked them,\r\nand turning his sleepy eyes slowly upon each passer-by. Well, I\r\ndrifted around in his direction.\r\n\r\nRight at the corner of the street, a big limousine was standing; an\r\nup-to-date car, fawn cushions, silver-plated fittings, and simply\r\nstuffed with fresh-cut flowers. A useful-looking Nubian was chauffeur,\r\nand on the step squatted a fat and resplendent being in all the glory\r\nof much gold braid.\r\n\r\nThese _harêm_ guards are rarely seen in Cairo nowadays--they belong\r\nto the other picturesque Oriental institutions which have begun to\r\nfade with the crescent of Islâm. There was something startlingly\r\nincongruous about this full-grown specimen, that bloated\r\nrepresentative of Eastern despotism squatting on the step of an\r\nup-to-date French car.\r\n\r\nIt was a kind of all-round shock; I cannot describe how it struck me.\r\nIt was something like running into Martin Luther at the Grand National\r\nor Nero, say, at an aviation meeting.\r\n\r\nThis was a frightfully hot morning, and the adipose object on the car\r\nstep was slumbering blissfully. A moment later I spotted the charge\r\nwhich he was guarding with such sedulous care. She was seated in\r\nHassan's shop--well back in the shadows--a gauzy white vision, all\r\neyes and _yashmak_. A confidential female servant accompanied her.\r\nThey made a pleasing picture enough, and a more suitable setting could\r\nnot well be found. It was an illustrated page of the _Arabian Nights_,\r\nand it appealed strongly even to my jaded perceptions.\r\n\r\nOf course, I was not going to interrupt the _tête-à-tête_; but from\r\nwhere I stood I could observe the group very well whilst remaining\r\nmyself unobserved. It presently became evident that the lady of the\r\n_yashmak_, under the pretence of purchasing perfumes, was merely\r\nkilling time, and my interest increased as the hour of noon grew near\r\nand the artistic group remained unbroken. You know the Mosque of\r\nEl-Ashraf by Hassan's shop? Its minaret almost overhung the place.\r\nWell, in due course, out popped the _mueddin_.\r\n\r\n\"_La il aha illa Allah...._\"\r\n\r\nThere he was a very sweet-voiced singer, as I noted at the time,\r\ntelling them there was no God but God, and all the rest of it; and\r\npresently he worked round to the side of the gallery overlooking\r\nHassan's shop.\r\n\r\nThen I could see which way the wind blew. He seemed to be deliberately\r\nsinging _at_ the picturesque trio--and the dark eyes of the lady of\r\nthe _yashmak_ were lifted upward--in reverence, perhaps; but I hardly\r\nthought so.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about the _mueddin's_ final glance, as he turned\r\nand retired from the gallery. I remained where I was until the\r\n_yashmak_ left the shop; and as she had to pass quite close to me in\r\norder to rejoin the waiting car, I had a good look at her.\r\n\r\nIt was just an impression, of course, an impression of red lips under\r\nthe white gauze, an oval Oriental outline, with very fine eyes--notably\r\nfine, where fine eyes are common--and a little exquisitely chiseled\r\nnose; a bewitching face. Just that one glimpse I had and a vague\r\nimpression of rustling silk with the tap of high heels. A faint breath\r\nof musk still proclaimed itself above the less pleasing odors of the\r\nstreet; then, the female attendant having cuffed the slumbering Silenus\r\ninto wakefulness, the car moved off and this _harêm_ lily vanished from\r\nthe bazaar.\r\n\r\nI knew that my party was safe for another half an hour, at any rate,\r\nso I nipped along to Hassan's shop. Of course, he began brazenly by\r\ndeclaring that no ladies had been there that morning. I had expected\r\nit, and the attitude confirmed my suspicions.\r\n\r\nPresently, when his boy had made fresh coffee, and Hassan, from the\r\nblack cabinet, had produced some real cigarettes, we got more\r\nintimate. There was a scarcity of European visitors that morning; and\r\nexcepting one interruption by a party of four American ladies, I had\r\nHassan to myself for half an hour.\r\n\r\nHe raised his fat finger to his lips when I pressed my question, and\r\nrolled his eyes fearfully.\r\n\r\n\"She is from the palace of Harûn Pasha,\" he whispered with more\r\nsidelong glances. \"Ah! _effendim_, I fear....\"\r\n\r\nWe smoked awhile; then--\r\n\r\n\"The Pasha's wife?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"It is the Lady Zohara,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThis did not add greatly to my information; but I continued: \"And\r\nthe _mueddin_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!--do not whisper it.... That is my brother, Saïd!\"\r\n\r\n\"He raises his eyes very high?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, _effendim_; it is she who raises her eyes. I fear--I fear\r\nfor Saïd. The Pasha ... you have heard of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I may have heard his name,\" I replied; \"but I am quite unfamiliar\r\nwith his reputation.\"\r\n\r\nHassan shook his head gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"He is the last of his race,\" he explained; \"the race of the Khalîfs.\r\nHe inhabits the ancient palace--but much has been rebuilt, and much\r\nadded--in Old Cairo, close behind the Coptic Church....\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know that such a palace even existed.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Hassan raised his finger to his lips.\r\n\r\n\"He is not like the other pashas,\" he said; \"in the house of Harûn\r\nPasha are observed to-day all the old customs as in the day of his\r\ngreat ancestor Harûn al-Raschîd.\"\r\n\r\n\"But a motor-car!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, _effendim_, he does not scorn to employ modern comforts, nor do\r\nI mean that he is a strict Moslem. But you saw the one who sat upon\r\nthe step? The _harêm_ of the Pasha is well guarded; not only by such\r\nas he, but by the Nubians and by the other mutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mutes!\"\r\n\r\n\"He has many slaves. His agent in Mecca procures for him the pick of\r\nthe market.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is no such thing as slavery in Egypt!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the slaves know that, _effendim_?\" he asked simply. \"Those who\r\nhave tongues are never seen outside the walls--unless they are guarded\r\nby those who have no tongue!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a curious sidelight upon a more curious possibility and I was\r\nmuch impressed.\r\n\r\n\"Your brother----\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! I have warned him! I fear, most sincerely I fear, that one dark\r\nnight the same will befall him that befell the son of my cousin, Ali.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He climbed the wall of the Pasha's garden. There is a fig tree\r\ngrowing close beside it at one place. Someone assisted him to descend\r\non the other. But he had been betrayed; the Nubian mutes took him--and\r\nthey----\"\r\n\r\nHe bent and whispered in my ear.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" I cried--\"impossible! _báss! báss!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, _effendim_--nor was that all. After that they----\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, Hassan, enough!\" I cried. \"_Usbûr!_\"\r\n\r\nHassan sighed, raising fearful eyes to the minaret.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThere has been nothing you are likely to disbelieve so far; but\r\nnow--well, I specified at the beginning--no comments. Let me tell the\r\nstory in my own way, and you have permission to _think_ what you\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nThere was a dance at Shepheard's that night, and young Forrest rather\r\ninterfered with my plans again as to one of the members of the English\r\nparty; I think I have referred to her before? That sent me home in a\r\nbad humor--at least not home; for as I was standing over by the\r\nEzbekîyeh Gardens, wondering whether to go along to \"Jimmy's\" or not,\r\nI formed a sudden determination to go and have a look at the abode of\r\nHarûn Pasha instead!\r\n\r\nMind you, I was not surprised to have lived in Cairo all these years\r\nwithout having heard of the place; I had learned things about the\r\nMûski in the morning, from my tourist friends, which had revealed to\r\nme something of my pitiable ignorance. But I was determined to mend my\r\nways, so to speak, and I thought I would turn my restless mood to good\r\npurpose, by improving my knowledge of my neighbors.\r\n\r\nI induced the torpid driver of an _arabîyeh_ to drive me out to Old\r\nCairo. He obviously considered me to be even more demented than the\r\nrest of my countrymen, but since the fare would be a substantial one,\r\nhe tackled the job. Mad expedition? Quite so; but you appreciate the\r\nmood?\r\n\r\nAfter we had passed a certain quarter--a quarter which never\r\nsleeps--there was nothing livelier than decayed tombs _en route_. In\r\nthe chill of the evening I began to weigh up my own foolishness\r\nappreciatively, but having got so far as the Coptic Church--you know\r\nthe church I mean?--I was not going back unsatisfied; so I told my man\r\nto wait, and started off to look for the famous palace.\r\n\r\nI must say the scene was impressive; a sky full of diamonds and a moon\r\njust bursting with light. The liquid night--sounds of the Nile alone\r\ndisturbed the silence, and the buildings might have been made of\r\nmother-o'-pearl, so flawless and pure did they seem, gleaming there\r\nunder the moon.\r\n\r\nWell, I wandered up some narrow streets--past ruins of former\r\nimportant houses, and all that--until I found myself in the shadow of\r\na high wall which obviously was kept in good repair. I followed this\r\nfor some distance, and I could see trees on the other side; at one\r\nplace a perfect mat of those purple flowers hung over the top;\r\ngorgeous things; the name begins with a B, but I can never remember\r\nit. This seemed promising, and as there was not a soul in sight, nor,\r\non the visible evidences, a habitable building near me, I began to\r\nfossick for a likely place to climb up.\r\n\r\nPresently I found the spot, and at the same time confirmation of my\r\nbelief that these were the precincts of the Pasha. A fig tree grew\r\nbeside the wall, affording an admirable means of reaching the top--a\r\nnatural ladder. In a jiffy I was up ... and overlooking one of the\r\nmost glorious gardens I had ever seen or dreamt of!\r\n\r\nIt must have been planned by an artist simply soaked in the lore of\r\nthe Orient. It set me thinking of Edmond Dulac's illustrations to the\r\n_Arabian Nights_. Apart from those pages, you never saw anything like\r\nit, I swear. The position of each tree was a study; the arrangement of\r\nthe flowerbeds was poetic--that is the only word for it; there was a\r\npond with marble seats around and a flight of steps with big copper\r\nurns filled with growing flowers, mosaic paths, and lesser pools with\r\nfountains playing. I peered down into the water, and the moon rays\r\nglittered magically upon the scales of the golden carp which darted\r\nthere. And all this fairy prospect was no more than an introduction,\r\nas it were, a sort of lead-up, to the Aladdin's Palace beyond.\r\n\r\nI saw now that what with palms and the natural rise of the land back\r\nfrom the Nile, the wonderful palace, with its terraces and gleaming\r\ndomes, must actually be invisible from all points; a more secret\r\nlocality one could not well imagine.\r\n\r\nAs to this magician's abode, which lay before me, I shall not attempt\r\nto describe it. But turn to the illustrations which I have mentioned,\r\nor to those of Burton's big edition; I will leave it to the artist's\r\nand your imagination to fill up the canvas.\r\n\r\nLights shone out from a hundred windows. Out of the ghostly, tomb-like\r\nsilence of Old Cairo, I had clambered into a sort of fairyland; I\r\nstood there with the spray from a fountain wetting me, and rubbed my\r\neyes. Honestly, I should not have been surprised to find myself\r\ndreaming. Well, you may be sure I was not going back yet; there was\r\nnot a living soul to be seen in the gardens, and I meant to have a\r\npeep into the palace, whatever the chances.\r\n\r\nThe likeliest point, as I soon determined, was to the west--where a\r\nlong, low wing of the building extended, and was lost, if I may use\r\nthe term, in a great bank of verdure and purple blooms. I took full\r\nadvantage of the ample shadow cast by the trees, and came right up\r\nunder the white wall without mishap.\r\n\r\nTo my right, the wall was obviously modern, but to my left, although\r\nin the distance and under the moon it had seemed uniform, it was built\r\nof sandstone blocks and was evidently of great age. The palace proper,\r\nyou understand, was fully forty yards east; the place before me was a\r\nsort of low extension and evidently had no real connection with the\r\nresidential part.\r\n\r\nJust above my head was a square window, iron-barred, but this did not\r\nlook promising, and cautiously, for I was hampered by the creepers\r\nwhich grew under the wall, I felt my way further west. Presently I\r\nencountered a pointed door of black, time-seared wood, and heavily\r\niron-studded. Then, with alarming suddenness, the quietude of my\r\nadventure was broken; things began to move with breathless rapidity.\r\n\r\nA most dreadful screaming and howling split the stillness and made me\r\njump like a startled frog!\r\n\r\nThe sound of a lash on bare flesh reached me from some place behind\r\nthe pointed door. Screams for mercy in thick, guttural Arabic, mingled\r\nand punctuated with horrifying shrieks of pain, informed my ignorance\r\nunmistakably that mediæval methods yet ruled in the civilized Near\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nScreams and supplications merged into a dull moaning; but the whistle\r\nof the lash continued uninterruptedly. Then that too ceased, and dimly\r\ncame the sounds of a muffled colloquy; a sort of gurgling talk that\r\ngot me wondering.\r\n\r\nI had just time to creep away and conceal myself behind a thick clump\r\nof bushes, when the door was thrown open, and the most gigantic negro\r\nI have ever set eyes upon appeared in the opening, outlined against\r\nthe smoky glare from within. He had one gleaming bare arm about the\r\nneck of an insensible man, and he dragged him out into the garden as\r\none might drag a heavy sack; dropping him all in a quivering heap upon\r\nthe very spot which I had just vacated!\r\n\r\nThe negro, who was stripped to the waist and whose glistening body\r\nreminded me of a bronze statue of Hercules, stood looking down at the\r\ninsensible victim, with a hideous leer. I ventured to raise myself\r\never so slightly; and in the ghastly, sweat-bedaubed face of the\r\ntortured man--whose bare shoulders were bloody from the lash--I\r\nrecognized the Silenus of the limousine!\r\n\r\nIn response to a guttural inarticulate muttering by the black giant, a\r\nsecond Nubian, of scarcely lesser dimensions, emerged from the dungeon\r\nwith a jar of water. He drenched the swooning man, evidently in order\r\nto revive him; and, when the wretched being ultimately fought his way\r\nback to agonized consciousness--to my horror he was seized, dragged in\r\nthrough the doorway again, and once more I heard the whistle of the\r\nlash being applied to his lacerated back, the skin of which was\r\nalready in ribbons.\r\n\r\nI suppose there are times when the most discreet man is snatched\r\noutside himself by circumstances? The door of this beastly\r\ntorture-room had not been reclosed, and before I could realize what I\r\nwas about, I found myself inside!\r\n\r\nThe wretched victim had been hauled up to a beam by his bound wrists,\r\nand the huge Nubian was putting all his strength into the wielding of\r\nthe cat-o'-nine-tails, drawing blood with every stroke; whilst his\r\nassistant hung on to the rope running through a pulley-block in the\r\nlow ceiling.\r\n\r\nAll in a sort of whirl (I was raving mad with indignation) I got\r\namongst the trio, and landed a clip on the jaw of the son of Erebus\r\nwhich made his teeth rattle like castanets.\r\n\r\nDown came the fat sufferer all in a heap in his own blood. Down went\r\nmy man, and began to cough out broken molars. Then it was my turn;\r\nand down _I_ went with the second mute on top of me, and the pair of\r\nus were playing hell all about the blood-spattered floor--up, down,\r\nunder, over--straining, punching, kicking ... then my antagonist\r\nintroduced gouging, and I had to beat the mat.\r\n\r\nIt had been a stiff bout, and the stinking shambles were whirling\r\nabout me like a bloody maelstrom. When things settled down a bit, I\r\nfound myself lying in a small cell skewered up like a pullet, and with\r\na prospect of iron grating and stone-flagged passage before me. I was\r\nmore than a trifle damaged, and my head was singing like a kettle. If\r\nI had thought that I dreamed before, it was a struggle now to convince\r\nmyself that this was not a nightmare.\r\n\r\nAmid the rattling of chains and dropping of bars, a fantastic\r\nprocession was filing down the passage. First came a hideous,\r\ncrook-backed apparition, hook-nosed, and bearing a lantern. Behind him\r\nappeared two guards with glittering scimitars. Behind the guards\r\nwalked a fourth personage, black-robed and white-turbaned--a sort of\r\ndignified dragoman, carrying an enormous bunch of keys.\r\n\r\nThe iron grating of my dungeon was unlocked and raised, and I was\r\nrequested, in Arabic, to rise and follow. Realizing that this was no\r\ntime for funny business, I staggered to my feet, and between the two\r\nScimitars marched unsteadily through a maze of passages with doors\r\nunlocked and locked behind us, stairs ascended and stairs descended.\r\n\r\nFrom empty passages, our journey led us to passages richly carpeted\r\nand softly lighted. By a heavy door opening on to the first of the\r\nlatter, we left the squinting man; and, with the two Scimitars and\r\nBlack Robe, I found myself crossing a lofty pavilion.\r\n\r\nThe floor was of rich mosaic, and priceless carpets were spread about\r\nin artistic confusion. Above my head loomed a great dome, lighted by\r\nstained glass windows in which the blue of lapis-lazuli predominated.\r\nBy golden chains from above swung golden lamps burning perfumed oil\r\nand flooding the pavilion with a mellow blue light. There were inlaid\r\ntables and cabinets; great blue vases of exquisite Chinese porcelain\r\nstood in niches of the wall. The walls were of that faintly\r\namber-tinted alabaster which is quarried in the Mokattam Hills; and\r\nthere were fragile columns of some delicately azure-veined marble,\r\nrising, graceful and slender, ethereal as pencils of smoke, to a\r\nbalcony high above my head; then, from this, a second series of fairy\r\ncolumns crept in blue streaks up into the luminous shadows of the\r\ndome.\r\n\r\nWe crossed this place, my heel taps echoing hollowly and before a\r\ncurtained door took pause. An impressive interval of perfumed silence;\r\nthen in response to the muffled clapping of hands, the curtain was\r\nraised and I was thrust into a smaller apartment beyond.\r\n\r\nI found myself standing before a long _dîwan_, amid an opulence of\r\nOriental appointment which surpassed anything which I could have\r\nimagined. The atmosphere was heavy with the odor of burning perfumes,\r\nand, whereas the lofty pavilion afforded a delicate study in blue,\r\nthis chamber was voluptuously amber--amber-shaded lamps, amber\r\ncushions, amber carpets; everywhere the glitter of amber and gold.\r\n\r\nAmid the amber sea, half immersed in the golden silks of the daïs,\r\nreclined a large and portly Sheikh; full and patriarchal his beard,\r\nwherein played amber tints, lofty and serene his brow, sweeping up to\r\nthe snowy turban. From a mouthpiece of amber and gold he inhaled the\r\nscented smoke of a _narghli_. Behind him, upon a cushioned stool,\r\nknelt a female whose beauty of face and form was unmistakable, since\r\nit was undisguised by the filmy artistry of her attire. With a\r\ngigantic fan of peacock's feathers, she cooled the Sheikh, and\r\ndispersed the flies which threatened to disturb his serenity. A second\r\nhouri received in her hands the amber mouthpiece as it fell from her\r\nlord's lips; a third, who evidently had been playing upon a lute, rose\r\nand glided from the apartment like an opium vision, as I entered\r\nbetween the guardian Scimitars.\r\n\r\nI found myself thinking of Saint Saen's music to _Samson and Delilah_;\r\nthe barbaric strains of the exquisite _bacchanale_ were beating on my\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nBlack Robe advanced and knelt upon the floor of the _dîwan_.\r\n\r\n\"We have brought the wretched malefactor into your glorious presence,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nThe Pasha (for I knew, beyond doubt, that I stood before Harûn Pasha)\r\nraised his eyes and fixed a stern gaze upon me. He gazed long and\r\nfixedly, and an odd change took place in his expression. He seemed\r\nabout to address me, then, apparently changing his mind, he addressed\r\nthe recumbent figure at his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Have the slaves returned with the female miscreant and her partner in\r\nSatan?\" he demanded sternly.\r\n\r\n\"Lord of the age,\" replied the other, rising upon his knees, \"they are\r\nexpected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them be brought before me,\" directed the Pasha, \"upon the instant\r\nof their arrival. Has Misrûn confessed his complicity?\"\r\n\r\n\"He fainted beneath the lash, excellency, but confessed that he\r\nslept--that pig who prayed without washing and whose birth was a\r\ncalamity--on several occasions when accompanying the lady Zohara.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave us!\" cried the Pasha. \"But, first, unbind the prisoner.\"\r\n\r\nHe swept his arm around comprehensively, and everyone withdrew from\r\nthe apartment, including the Scimitars (one of whom cut my lashings)\r\nand the lady of the fan. I found myself alone with Harûn Pasha.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\"Sit here beside me!\" directed the Pasha.\r\n\r\nBeing yet too dazed for wonder or protest, I obeyed mechanically. My\r\nexact situation was not clear to me at the moment and I was a long way\r\noff knowing how to act.\r\n\r\n\"I am much disturbed in mind, and my bosom is contracted,\" continued\r\nthe Pasha, with a certain benignity, \"by reason of a conspiracy in my\r\n_harêm_, which came to a head this night, and which led to the loss of\r\nthe pearl of my household, a damsel who cost me her weight in gold,\r\nwho entangled me in the snare of her love and pierced me with anguish.\r\nKnow, O young Inglîsi, that love is difficult. Alas! she who had\r\ncaptivated my reason by her loveliness fled with a shame of the\r\nMoslems who defamed the sacred office of _mueddin_! In truth he is\r\nnaught but the son of a disease and a consort of camels. My soul\r\ncries out to Allah and my mind is a nest of wasps. Relate to me your\r\ncase, that it may turn me from the contemplation of my sorrows. At\r\nanother time, it had gone hard with you, and penalties of a most\r\nunfortunate description had been visited upon your head, O disturber\r\nof my peace; but since this child of filth and progeny of mules has\r\nshattered it forever, your lesser crime comes but as a diversion.\r\nRelate to me the matters which have brought you to this miserable\r\npass.\"\r\n\r\nThere was some still little voice in my mind which was trying to speak\r\nto me, if you understand what I mean. But what with the suffocating\r\nperfume of ambergris (or it may have been frankincense), my incredible\r\nsurroundings, and the buzzing of my maltreated skull, I simply could\r\n_not_ think connectedly.\r\n\r\nA memory was struggling for identification in my addled brain; but\r\nwhether it was due to something I had seen, heard, or smelled, I could\r\nnot for the life of me make out. I heard myself spinning my own\r\nimprobable yarn as one listens to a dreary and boresome recitation;\r\n_I_ didn't seem to be the raconteur; my mind was busy about that amber\r\nroom, furiously chasing that hare-like memory, which leaped and\r\ndoubled, dived under the silken cushions, popped up behind the Pasha,\r\nand flicked its ears at me from amid the feathers of the peacock fan.\r\n\r\nI driveled right on to the end of my story, mechanically, without\r\nhaving got my mind in proper working order; and when the Pasha spoke\r\nagain--there was that wretched memory still dodging me, sometimes\r\nalmost within my grasp, but always just eluding it.\r\n\r\n\"Your amusing narrative has diverted me,\" said the Pasha; and he\r\nclapped his hands three times.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to me, you will note, to assert myself in any way; I\r\naccepted the lordly condescensions of this singular personage without\r\nprotest. You will be wondering why I didn't kick up a devil of a\r\nhullabaloo--declare that I had come in response to screams for\r\nassistance--wave the dreaded name of the British Agent under the\r\nPasha's nose, and all that. I can only say that I didn't; I was\r\nsubdued; in fact I was down, utterly down and out.\r\n\r\nBlack Robe entered with eyes averted.\r\n\r\n\"Well, wretched vermin!\" roared the Pasha in sudden wrath; \"do you\r\ntell me they are not here?\"\r\n\r\nThe man, with his head bumping on the carpet, visibly trembled.\r\n\r\n\"Most noble,\" he replied hoarsely, \"your lowly slave has exerted\r\nhimself to the utmost----\"\r\n\r\n\"Out! son of a calamity!\" shouted the Pasha--and before my astonished\r\neyes he raised the heavy _narghli_ and hurled it at the bowed head of\r\nthe man before him.\r\n\r\nIt struck the white turban with a resounding crack, and then was\r\nshattered to bits upon the floor. It was a blow to have staggered a\r\nmule. But Black Robe, without apparent loss of dignity, rose and\r\ndeparted, bowing.\r\n\r\nThe Pasha sat rocking about, and plucking madly at his beard.\r\n\r\n\"O Allah!\" he cried, \"how I suffer.\" He turned to me. \"Never since the\r\nday that another of your race (but, this one, a true son of Satan)\r\ncame to my palace, have I tasted so much suffering. You shall judge\r\nof my clemency, O imprudent stranger, and pacify your heart with the\r\nspectacle of another's punishment.\"\r\n\r\nHe clapped his hands twice. This time there was a short delay, which\r\nthe Pasha suffered impatiently; then there entered the squint-eyed\r\nman, together with the two Scimitars.\r\n\r\n\"I would visit the dungeon of the false Pasha,\" said my singular host;\r\nand, rising to his feet, he placed his hand upon my shoulder and\r\nindicated that we were to proceed from the apartment.\r\n\r\nLed by Crook Back, in whose hand the gigantic bunch of keys rattled\r\nunmelodiously, and followed by the Scimitars, we proceeded upon our\r\nway; and it was beyond the powers of my disordered brain to dismiss\r\nthe idea that I was taking part in a Christmas pantomime. Many steps\r\nwere descended; many heavy doors unbolted and unbarred, bolted and\r\nbarred behind us; many stone-paved passages, reminding me of operatic\r\nscenery, were traversed ere we came to one tunnel more gloomy than the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nUpon the right was a blank stone wall, upon the left, a series of\r\ndoors, black with age and heavily iron-studded. The only illumination\r\nwas that furnished by the lantern which Crook Back carried.\r\n\r\nBefore one of the doors the Pasha paused.\r\n\r\n\"In which is Misrûn?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"In the next, excellency,\" replied the jailer--for such I took to be\r\nthe office of the hunchback.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he held the lantern to the grating.\r\n\r\nI found myself peering into a filthy dungeon, the reek of which made\r\nme ill; and there, upon the stone floor, lay poor Silenus! He raised\r\nhis eyes to the light.\r\n\r\n\"Lord of the age,\" he moaned, lifting his manacled wrists, \"glory of\r\nthe universe, sun of suns! I have confessed my frightful sin, and most\r\ndire misfortunes. Of your sublime mercy, take pity upon the meanest\r\nthing that creeps upon the earth----\"\r\n\r\n\"Proceed!\" said the Pasha.\r\n\r\nAnd with the moaning cries of Misrûn growing fainter behind us, we\r\nmoved along the passage. Before a second door, we halted again, and\r\nthe jailer raised the lantern.\r\n\r\n\"Look upon this!\" cried the Pasha to me--\"look well, and look long!\"\r\n\r\nShudderingly I peered in between the bars. It had come home to me how\r\nI was utterly at the mercy of this man's moods. If he had chosen to\r\nhave me hurled into one of his dungeons, what prospect of release\r\nwould have been mine? Who would ever know of my plight? No one! And\r\nbeyond doubt I was in the realm of an absolute monarch. I silently\r\nthanked my lucky stars that my lot was not the lot of him who occupied\r\nthis second dungeon.\r\n\r\nAs the dim light, casting shadow bars across the filthy floor, picked\r\nout the features of the prisoner, I gave a great start. Save that the\r\nbeard was more gray, longer, filthy and unkempt, and that, in place\r\nof the nearly shaven skull, this unhappy being displayed dishevelled\r\nlocks, the captive might easily have passed for the Pasha.\r\n\r\nI met the eye of this terrible despot.\r\n\r\n\"Look upon the false Pasha,\" he said; \"look upon the one who thought\r\nto dispossess me! For years, by his own miserable confession, he\r\nstudied me in secret. When I journeyed to my estates in Assuan\" (I\r\nstarted again) \"he was watching--watching--always watching. His\r\nscheme, which was whispered into his ear by the Evil One, was no plant\r\nof sudden growth, but a tree, that, from a seed of Satan planted in\r\nfertile soil, had flourished exceedingly, tended by the hand of\r\nvillainous ambition.\"\r\n\r\nI clutched at the bars for support. The stench of the place was simply\r\nindescribable; but it was neither the stench nor the bizarre incidents\r\nof the night which accounted for my dizziness: it was the sudden\r\ntangibility of that hitherto elusive memory.\r\n\r\nIn build, in complexion, in certain mannerisms underlying the\r\ndignified assumption, Harûn Pasha might well have been the twin\r\nbrother of Jack Dunlap!\r\n\r\nA frightful possibility burst upon me like a bomb; clutching the bars\r\nwith quivering hands, I stared and stared at the wretched impostor in\r\nthe cell. _Could_ it be? Had he been mad enough to make some attempt\r\nupon the Pasha? And was this his end?\r\n\r\nI looked around again. I searched the bearded features of the Pasha\r\nwith eager gaze. Good God! either I was going mad, or incredible\r\nthings had been done, were being done, in Cairo.\r\n\r\nI had not seen Dunlap for a year, remember, and in the ordinary way\r\nI did not see him more than half a dozen times in twelve months, so\r\nthat, all things considered, it was not so remarkable that I had\r\noverlooked the resemblance. A full beard and mustache, artificially\r\ndarkened eyelashes, a shaven head and a white turban, are effectual\r\ndisguises; but if you can imagine Dunlap--the Dunlap you remember--so\r\narrayed, then you have Harûn Pasha. Imagine Harûn Pasha, dirty,\r\nbedraggled, a hopeless captive ... and you have the prisoner who\r\ncrouched upon the straw in that noisome dungeon!\r\n\r\nFor the second time that night I was lifted out of myself. I turned\r\non the man beside me in a blazing fury.\r\n\r\n\"You villain!\" I shouted at him, and clenched my fists--\"do you _dare_\r\nto confine a Britisher in your stinking cellars. By God! sir....\"\r\n\r\nHarûn Pasha clapped his hand over my mouth; the two guards had me by\r\nthe arms from behind. But my cries had aroused the man in the dungeon,\r\nand, as I was dragged down the passage, these moaning words reached\r\nme, spoken in Arabic:\r\n\r\n\"Help! help! Englishman! A crime has been committed! I appeal to\r\nLord----.\"\r\n\r\nA door was slammed fast with a resounding bang, and the rest of the\r\ncaptive's appeal was lost to me. One of my guards had substituted his\r\nhand for that of the Pasha, but now it was removed; and, speechless\r\nwith rage, I found myself being thrust up stone stairs--and I realized\r\nthat by a moment's indiscretion, I had ruined everything.\r\n\r\nBack in the amber apartment once more, with the two Scimitars at the\r\ndoor and Harûn Pasha reclining upon the cushions, I found speech.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with me?\" I demanded.\r\n\r\n\"My son,\" replied the Pasha with benignity, \"I pardon all! Your great\r\ncourage and address, together with the modesty of your deportment, and\r\nthe spirit of adventure which has brought you to your present\r\nunfortunate case, plead for you in a manner which my clemency cannot\r\nresist. It is my unhappy lot often to be called upon to punish.\r\nTo-night, those gloomy dungeons which you have seen will echo, alas,\r\nwith the howls of miserable wretches who are responsible for the loss\r\nof the pearl of my soul; for I am persuaded that she has fled with the\r\nson of offal who profaned the words of Allah from the minaret. This\r\nbeing so, I would temper my proper severity with a merciful deed. You\r\nshall never speak of what you have seen within these walls, save in\r\nterms suitably disguised. You shall never seek to return, nor, by\r\nspeech with any man, to confirm whatsoever you may suspect. Upon this\r\nwarranty, you shall depart in peace.\"\r\n\r\nHe clapped his hands twice, and a houri of most bewitching aspect\r\nglided into the _dîwan_.\r\n\r\n\"Bring sherbet!\" ordered the Pasha.\r\n\r\nThe maiden departed; and whilst I was yet trying to come to a\r\ndecision (the Pasha had mentioned no alternative, but my imagination\r\nwas equal to the task of supplying one!) she returned with a tray upon\r\nwhich were porcelain cups and two vessels of beautifully chased gold.\r\n\r\nHarûn Pasha decocted a sparkling beverage, and, with his own hands,\r\npassed the brimming cup to me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI knew you would not believe it; but I warned you, and I made a\r\nstipulation. Your idea is that I must be a poor sort of animal to\r\naccept so dishonorable a compromise? I agree. But the situation was\r\neven more peculiarly difficult than is apparent to you at the moment.\r\nWithout _seeking_ the information, I learned from Hassan of the Scent\r\nBazaar that his brother had indeed fled with the beauteous Lady\r\nZohara, no one knew whither; and this confirmation of the Pasha's\r\nsorrows touched a very tender spot in my heart!\r\n\r\nThen there is another little point.\r\n\r\nWhen the Pasha removed the elaborate stopper from the first of the\r\ngolden vessels to which I have just referred, _my_ eye alone perceived\r\nthat a bottle, bearing a familiar black and white label, was contained\r\nin this golden casing. The flavor of the decoction with which we\r\nsealed our infamous bargain clinched the matter.\r\n\r\nI was absolutely thrust out of the presence chamber before I had time\r\nfor another word; but, looking back from the door and meeting the eye\r\nof the Pasha, I encountered a most portentous wink. Therefore I have\r\nstuck to my bargain.\r\n\r\nOh! I have not given much away. The Pasha is not called Harûn, and the\r\npalace is nowhere near the Coptic Church in Old Cairo. Because, you\r\nsee, I only knew one man who winked in quite that elaborate\r\nfashion--and his name was Jack Dunlap!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIN THE VALLEY OF THE SORCERESS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nCondor wrote to me three times before the end (said Neville,\r\nAssistant-Inspector of Antiquities, staring vaguely from his open\r\nwindow at a squad drilling before the Kasr-en-Nîl Barracks). He dated\r\nhis letters from the camp at Deir-el-Bahari. Judging from these,\r\nsuccess appeared to be almost within his grasp. He shared my theories,\r\nof course, respecting Queen Hatasu, and was devoting the whole of his\r\nenergies to the task of clearing up the great mystery of Ancient Egypt\r\nwhich centres around that queen.\r\n\r\nFor him, as for me, there was a strange fascination about those\r\ndefaced walls and roughly obliterated inscriptions. That the queen\r\nunder whom Egyptian art came to the apogee of perfection should thus\r\nhave been treated by her successors; that no perfect figure of the\r\nwise, famous, and beautiful Hatasu should have been spared to\r\nposterity; that her very cartouche should have been ruthlessly removed\r\nfrom every inscription upon which it appeared, presented to Condor's\r\nmind a problem only second in interest to the immortal riddle of\r\nGîzeh.\r\n\r\nYou know my own views upon the matter? My monograph, \"Hatasu, the\r\nSorceress,\" embodies my opinion. In short, upon certain evidences,\r\nsome adduced by Theodore Davis, some by poor Condor, and some\r\nresulting from my own inquiries, I have come to the conclusion that\r\nthe source--real or imaginary--of this queen's power was an intimate\r\nacquaintance with what nowadays we term, vaguely, magic. Pursuing her\r\nstudies beyond the limit which is lawful, she met with a certain end,\r\nnot uncommon, if the old writings are to be believed, in the case of\r\nthose who penetrate too far into the realms of the Borderland.\r\n\r\nFor this reason--the practice of black magic--her statues were\r\ndishonored, and her name erased from the monuments. Now, I do not\r\npropose to enter into any discussion respecting the reality of such\r\npractices; in my monograph I have merely endeavored to show that,\r\naccording to contemporary belief, the queen was a sorceress. Condor\r\nwas seeking to prove the same thing; and when I took up the inquiry,\r\nit was in the hope of completing his interrupted work.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to me early in the winter of 1908, from his camp by the Rock\r\nTemple. Davis's tomb, at Bibân el-Mulûk, with its long, narrow\r\npassage, apparently had little interest for him; he was at work on the\r\nhigh ground behind the temple, at a point one hundred yards or so due\r\nwest of the upper platform. He had an idea that he should find there\r\nthe mummies of Hatasu--and another; the latter, a certain Sen-Mût, who\r\nappears in the inscriptions of the reign as an architect high in the\r\nqueen's favor. The archæological points of the letter do not concern\r\nus in the least, but there was one odd little paragraph which I had\r\ncause to remember afterwards.\r\n\r\n\"A girl belonging to some Arab tribe,\" wrote Condor, \"came racing to\r\nthe camp two nights ago to claim my protection. What crime she had\r\ncommitted, and what punishment she feared, were far from clear; but\r\nshe clung to me, trembling like a leaf, and positively refused to\r\ndepart. It was a difficult situation, for a camp of fifty native\r\nexcavators, and one highly respectable European enthusiast, affords no\r\nsuitable quarters for an Arab girl--and a very personable Arab girl.\r\nAt any rate, she is still here; I have had a sort of lean-to rigged up\r\nin a little valley east of my own tent, but it is very embarrassing.\"\r\n\r\nNearly a month passed before I heard from Condor again; then came a\r\nsecond letter, with the news that on the eve of a great discovery--as\r\nhe believed--his entire native staff--the whole fifty--had deserted\r\none night in a body! \"Two days' work,\" he wrote, \"would have seen the\r\ntomb opened--for I am more than ever certain that my plans are\r\naccurate. Then I woke up one morning to find every man Jack of my\r\nfellows missing! I went down into the village where a lot of them\r\nlive, in a towering rage, but not one of the brutes was to be found,\r\nand their relations professed entire ignorance respecting their\r\nwhereabouts. What caused me almost as much anxiety as the check in my\r\nwork was the fact that Mahâra--the Arab girl--had vanished also. I am\r\nwondering if the thing has any sinister significance.\"\r\n\r\nCondor finished with the statement that he was making tremendous\r\nefforts to secure a new gang. \"But,\" said he, \"I shall finish the\r\nexcavation, if I have to do it with my own hands.\"\r\n\r\nHis third and last letter contained even stranger matters than the two\r\npreceding it. He had succeeded in borrowing a few men from the British\r\nArchæological camp in the Fáyûm. Then, just as the work was\r\nrestarting, the Arab girl, Mahâra, turned up again, and entreated him\r\nto bring her down the Nile, \"at least as far as Dendera. For the\r\nvengeance of her tribesmen,\" stated Condor, \"otherwise would result\r\nnot only in her own death, but in mine! At the moment of writing I am\r\nin two minds what to do. If Mahâra is to go upon this journey, I do\r\nnot feel justified in sending her alone, and there is no one here who\r\ncould perform the duty,\" etc.\r\n\r\nI began to wonder, of course; and I had it in mind to take the train\r\nto Luxor merely in order to see this Arab maiden, who seemed to occupy\r\nso prominent a place in Condor's mind. However, Fate would have it\r\notherwise; and the next thing I heard was that Condor had been brought\r\ninto Cairo, and was at the English hospital.\r\n\r\nHe had been bitten by a cat--presumably from the neighboring village;\r\nand although the doctor at Luxor dealt with the bite at once, traveled\r\ndown with him, and placed him in the hand of the Pasteur man at the\r\nhospital, he died, as you remember, in the night of his arrival,\r\nraving mad; the Pasteur treatment failed entirely.\r\n\r\nI never saw him before the end, but they told me that his howls were\r\nhorribly like those of a cat. His eyes changed in some way, too, I\r\nunderstand; and, with his fingers all contracted, he tried to\r\n_scratch_ everyone and everything within reach.\r\n\r\nThey had to strap the poor beggar down, and even then he tore the\r\nsheets into ribbons.\r\n\r\nWell, as soon as possible, I made the necessary arrangements to finish\r\nCondor's inquiry. I had access to his papers, plans, etc., and in the\r\nspring of the same year I took up my quarters near Deir-el-Bahari,\r\nroped off the approaches to the camp, stuck up the usual notices, and\r\nprepared to finish the excavation, which, I gathered, was in a fairly\r\nadvanced state.\r\n\r\nMy first surprise came very soon after my arrival, for when, with the\r\nplan before me, I started out to find the shaft, I found it,\r\ncertainly, but only with great difficulty.\r\n\r\nIt had been filled in again with sand and loose rock right to the very\r\ntop!\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAll my inquiries availed me nothing. With what object the excavation\r\nhad been thus closed I was unable to conjecture. That Condor had not\r\nreclosed it I was quite certain, for at the time of his mishap he had\r\nactually been at work at the bottom of the shaft, as inquiries from a\r\nnative of Suefee, in the Fáyûm, who was his only companion at the\r\ntime, had revealed.\r\n\r\nIn his eagerness to complete the inquiry, Condor, by lantern light,\r\nhad been engaged upon a solitary night-shift below, and the rabid cat\r\nhad apparently fallen into the pit; probably in a frenzy of fear, it\r\nhad attacked Condor, after which it had escaped.\r\n\r\nOnly this one man was with him, and he, for some reason that I could\r\nnot make out, had apparently been sleeping in the temple--quite a\r\nconsiderable distance from Condor's camp. The poor fellow's cries had\r\naroused him, and he had met Condor running down the path and away from\r\nthe shaft.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was good evidence of the existence of the shaft at the\r\ntime, and as I stood contemplating the tightly packed rubble which\r\nalone marked its site, I grew more and more mystified, for this task\r\nof reclosing the cutting represented much hard labor.\r\n\r\nBeyond perfecting my plans in one or two particulars, I did little on\r\nthe day of my arrival. I had only a handful of men with me, all of\r\nwhom I knew, having worked with them before, and beyond clearing\r\nCondor's shaft I did not intend to excavate further.\r\n\r\nHatasu's Temple presents a lively enough scene in the daytime during\r\nthe winter and early spring months, with the streams of tourists\r\nconstantly passing from the white causeway to Cook's Rest House on the\r\nedge of the desert. There had been a goodly number of visitors that day\r\nto the temple below, and one or two of the more curious and\r\nventuresome had scrambled up the steep path to the little plateau\r\nwhich was the scene of my operations. None had penetrated beyond the\r\nnotice boards, however, and now, with the evening sky passing through\r\nthose innumerable shades which defy palette and brush, which can only\r\nbe distinguished by the trained eye, but which, from palest blue melt\r\ninto exquisite pink, and by some magical combination form that deep\r\nviolet which does not exist to perfection elsewhere than in the skies\r\nof Egypt, I found myself in the silence and the solitude of \"the Holy\r\nValley.\"\r\n\r\nI stood at the edge of the plateau, looking out at the rosy belt which\r\nmarked the course of the distant Nile, with the Arabian hills vaguely\r\nsketched beyond. The rocks stood up against that prospect as great\r\nblack smudges, and what I could see of the causeway looked like a gray\r\nsmear upon a drab canvas. Beneath me were the chambers of the Rock\r\nTemple, with those wall paintings depicting events in the reign of\r\nHatasu which rank among the wonders of Egypt.\r\n\r\nNot a sound disturbed my reverie, save a faint clatter of cooking\r\nutensils from the camp behind me--a desecration of that sacred\r\nsolitude. Then a dog began to howl in the neighboring village.\r\nThe dog ceased, and faintly to my ears came the note of a reed\r\npipe. The breeze died away, and with it the piping.\r\n\r\nI turned back to the camp, and, having partaken of a frugal supper,\r\nturned in upon my campaigner's bed, thoroughly enjoying my freedom\r\nfrom the routine of official life in Cairo, and looking forward to\r\nthe morrow's work pleasurably.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances a man sleeps well; and when, in an uncanny\r\ngray half-light, which probably heralded the dawn, I awoke with a\r\nstart, I knew that something of an unusual nature alone could have\r\ndisturbed my slumbers.\r\n\r\nFirstly, then, I identified this with a concerted howling of the\r\nvillage dogs. They seemed to have conspired to make night hideous;\r\nI have never heard such an eerie din in my life. Then it gradually\r\nbegan to die away, and I realized, secondly, that the howling of the\r\ndogs and my own awakening might be due to some common cause. This\r\nidea grew upon me, and as the howling subsided, a sort of disquiet\r\npossessed me, and, despite my efforts to shake it off, grew more\r\nurgent with the passing of every moment.\r\n\r\nIn short, I fancied that the thing which had alarmed or enraged the\r\ndogs was passing from the village through the Holy Valley, upward\r\nto the Temple, upward to the plateau, and was approaching _me_.\r\n\r\nI have never experienced an identical sensation since, but I seemed\r\nto be audient of a sort of psychic patrol, which, from a remote\r\n_pianissimo_, swelled _fortissimo_, to an intimate but silent clamor,\r\nwhich beat in some way upon my brain, but not through the faculty of\r\nhearing, for now the night was deathly still.\r\n\r\nYet I was persuaded of some _approach_--of the coming of something\r\nsinister, and the suspense of waiting had become almost insupportable,\r\nso that I began to accuse my Spartan supper of having given me\r\nnightmare, when the tent-flap was suddenly raised, and, outlined\r\nagainst the paling blue of the sky, with a sort of reflected elfin\r\nlight playing upon her face, I saw an Arab girl looking in at me!\r\n\r\nBy dint of exerting all my self-control I managed to restrain the cry\r\nand upward start which this apparition prompted. Quite still, with my\r\nfists tightly clenched, I lay and looked into the eyes which were\r\nlooking into mine.\r\n\r\nThe style of literary work which it has been my lot to cultivate fails\r\nme in describing that beautiful and evil face. The features were\r\nseverely classical and small, something of the Bisharîn type, with a\r\ncruel little mouth and a rounded chin, firm to hardness. In the eyes\r\nalone lay the languor of the Orient; they were exceedingly--indeed,\r\nexcessively--long and narrow. The ordinary ragged, picturesque finery\r\nof a desert girl bedecked this midnight visitant, who, motionless,\r\nstood there watching me.\r\n\r\nI once read a work by Pierre de l'Ancre, dealing with the Black\r\nSabbaths of the Middle Ages, and now the evil beauty of this Arab face\r\nthrew my memory back to those singular pages, for, perhaps owing to\r\nthe reflected light which I have mentioned, although the explanation\r\nscarcely seemed adequate, those long, narrow eyes shone catlike in the\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I made up my mind. Throwing the blanket from me, I leapt to\r\nthe ground, and in a flash had gripped the girl by the wrists.\r\nConfuting some lingering doubts, she proved to be substantial enough.\r\nMy electric torch lay upon a box at the foot of the bed, and,\r\nstooping, I caught it up and turned its searching rays upon the face\r\nof my captive.\r\n\r\nShe fell back from me, panting like a wild creature trapped, then\r\ndropped upon her knees and began to plead--began to plead in a voice\r\nand with a manner which touched some chord of consciousness that I\r\ncould swear had never spoken before, and has never spoken since.\r\n\r\nShe spoke in Arabic, of course, but the words fell from her lips as\r\nliquid music in which lay all the beauty and all the deviltry of the\r\n\"Siren's Song.\" Fully opening her astonishing eyes, she looked up at\r\nme, and, with her free hand pressed to her bosom, told me how she had\r\nfled from an unwelcome marriage; how, an outcast and a pariah, she\r\nhad hidden in the desert places for three days and three nights,\r\nsustaining life only by means of a few dates which she had brought\r\nwith her, and quenching her thirst with stolen water-melons.\r\n\r\n\"I can bear it no longer, _effendim_. Another night out in the desert,\r\nwith the cruel moon beating, beating, beating upon my brain, with\r\ncreeping things coming out from the rocks, wriggling, wriggling, their\r\nmany feet making whisperings in the sand--ah, it will kill me! And I\r\nam for ever outcast from my tribe, from my people. No tent of all the\r\nArabs, though I fly to the gates of Damascus, is open to me, save I\r\nenter in shame, as a slave, as a plaything, as a toy. My\r\nheart\"--furiously she beat upon her breast--\"is empty and desolate,\r\n_effendim_. I am meaner than the lowliest thing that creeps upon the\r\nsand; yet the God that made that creeping thing made me also--and you,\r\nyou, who are merciful and strong, would not crush any creature because\r\nit was weak and helpless.\"\r\n\r\nI had released her wrist now, and was looking down at her in a sort\r\nof stupor. The evil which at first I had seemed to perceive in her was\r\neffaced, wiped out as an artist wipes out an error in his drawing. Her\r\ndark beauty was speaking to me in a language of its own; a strange\r\nlanguage, yet one so intelligible that I struggled in vain to\r\ndisregard it. And her voice, her gestures, and the witch-fire of her\r\neyes were whipping up my blood to a fever heat of passionate\r\nsorrow--of despair. Yes, incredible as it sounds, despair!\r\n\r\nIn short, as I see it now, this siren of the wilderness was playing\r\nupon me as an accomplished musician might play upon a harp, striking\r\nthis string and that at will, and sounding each with such full notes\r\nas they had rarely, if ever, emitted before.\r\n\r\nMost damnable anomaly of all, I--Edward Neville, archæologist, most\r\nprosy and matter-of-fact man in Cairo, perhaps--_knew_ that this nomad\r\nwho had burst into my tent, upon whom I had set eyes for the first\r\ntime scarce three minutes before, held me enthralled; and yet, with\r\nher wondrous eyes upon me, I could summon up no resentment, and could\r\noffer but poor resistance.\r\n\r\n\"In the Little Oasis, _effendim_, I have a sister who will admit me\r\ninto her household, if only as a servant. There I can be safe, there\r\nI can rest. O _Inglîsi_, at home in England you have a sister of your\r\nown! Would you see her pursued, a hunted thing from rock to rock,\r\ncrouching for shelter in the lair of some jackal, stealing that she\r\nmight live--and flying always, never resting, her heart leaping for\r\nfear, flying, flying, with nothing but dishonor before her?\"\r\n\r\nShe shuddered and clasped my left hand in both her own convulsively,\r\npulling it down to her bosom.\r\n\r\n\"There can be only one thing, _effendim_,\" she whispered. \"Do you not\r\nsee the white bones bleaching in the sun?\"\r\n\r\nThrowing all my resolution into the act, I released my hand from her\r\nclasp, and, turning aside, sat down upon the box which served me as\r\nchair and table, too.\r\n\r\nA thought had come to my assistance, had strengthened me in the moment\r\nof my greatest weakness; it was the thought of that Arab girl\r\nmentioned in Condor's letters. And a scheme of things, an incredible\r\nscheme, that embraced and explained some, if not all, of the horrible\r\ncircumstances attendant upon his death, began to form in my brain.\r\n\r\nBizarre it was, stretching out beyond the realm of things natural and\r\nproper, yet I clung to it, for there, in the solitude, with this\r\nwildly beautiful creature kneeling at my feet, and with her uncanny\r\npowers of fascination yet enveloping me like a cloak, I found it not\r\nso improbable as inevitably it must have seemed at another time.\r\n\r\nI turned my head, and through the gloom sought to look into the long\r\neyes. As I did so they closed and appeared as two darkly luminous\r\nslits in the perfect oval of the face.\r\n\r\n\"You are an impostor!\" I said in Arabic, speaking firmly and\r\ndeliberately. \"To Mr. Condor\"--I could have sworn that she started\r\nslightly at sound of the name--\"you called yourself Mahâra. I know\r\nyou, and I will have nothing to do with you.\"\r\n\r\nBut in saying it I had to turn my head aside, for the strangest,\r\nmaddest impulses were bubbling up in my brain in response to the\r\nglances of those half-shut eyes.\r\n\r\nI reached for my coat, which lay upon the foot of the bed, and, taking\r\nout some loose money, I placed fifty piastres in the nerveless brown\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"That will enable you to reach the Little Oasis, if such is your\r\ndesire,\" I said. \"It is all I can do for you, and now--you must go.\"\r\n\r\nThe light of the dawn was growing stronger momentarily, so that I\r\ncould see my visitor quite clearly. She rose to her feet, and stood\r\nbefore me, a straight, slim figure, sweeping me from head to foot with\r\nsuch a glance of passionate contempt as I had never known or suffered.\r\n\r\nShe threw back her head magnificently, dashed the money on the ground\r\nat my feet, and, turning, leaped out of the tent.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I hesitated, doubting, questioning my humanity, testing\r\nmy fears; then I took a step forward, and peered out across the\r\nplateau. Not a soul was in sight. The rocks stood up gray and eerie,\r\nand beneath lay the carpet of the desert stretching unbroken to the\r\nshadows of the Nile Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWe commenced the work of clearing the shaft at an early hour that\r\nmorning. The strangest ideas were now playing in my mind, and in some\r\nway I felt myself to be in opposition to definite enmity. My\r\nexcavators labored with a will, and, once we had penetrated below the\r\nfirst three feet or so of tightly packed stone, it became a mere\r\nmatter of shoveling, for apparently the lower part of the shaft had\r\nbeen filled up principally with sand.\r\n\r\nI calculated that four days' work at the outside would see the shaft\r\nclear to the base of Condor's excavation. There remained, according\r\nto his own notes, only another six feet or so; but it was solid\r\nlimestone--the roof of the passage, if his plans were correct,\r\ncommunicating with the tomb of Hatasu.\r\n\r\nWith the approach of night, tired as I was, I felt little inclination\r\nfor sleep. I lay down on my bed with a small Browning pistol under the\r\npillow, but after an hour or so of nervous listening drifted off into\r\nslumber. As on the night before, I awoke shortly before the coming of\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nAgain the village dogs were raising a hideous outcry, and again I was\r\nkeenly conscious of some ever-nearing menace. This consciousness grew\r\nstronger as the howling of the dogs grew fainter, and the sense of\r\n_approach_ assailed me as on the previous occasion.\r\n\r\nI sat up immediately with the pistol in my hand, and, gently raising\r\nthe tent flap, looked out over the darksome plateau. For a long time\r\nI could perceive nothing; then, vaguely outlined against the sky, I\r\ndetected something that moved above the rocky edge.\r\n\r\nIt was so indefinite in form that for a time I was unable to identify\r\nit, but as it slowly rose higher and higher, two luminous\r\neyes--obviously feline eyes, since they glittered greenly in the\r\ndarkness--came into view. In character and in shape they were the eyes\r\nof a cat, but in point of size they were larger than the eyes of any\r\ncat I had ever seen. Nor were they jackal eyes. It occurred to me that\r\nsome predatory beast from the Sûdan might conceivably have strayed\r\nthus far north.\r\n\r\nThe presence of such a creature would account for the nightly\r\ndisturbance amongst the village dogs; and, dismissing the\r\nsuperstitious notions which had led me to associate the mysterious\r\nArab girl with the phenomenon of the howling dogs, I seized upon this\r\nnew idea with a sort of gladness.\r\n\r\nStepping boldly out of the tent, I strode in the direction of the\r\ngleaming eyes. Although my only weapon was the Browning pistol, it was\r\na weapon of considerable power, and, moreover, I counted upon the\r\nwell-known cowardice of nocturnal animals. I was not disappointed in\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nThe eyes dropped out of sight, and as I leaped to the edge of rock\r\noverhanging the temple a lithe shape went streaking off in the\r\ngreyness beneath me. Its coloring appeared to be black, but this\r\nappearance may have been due to the bad light. Certainly it was no\r\ncat, was no jackal; and once, twice, thrice my Browning spat into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nApparently I had not scored a hit, but the loud reports of the weapon\r\naroused the men sleeping in the camp, and soon I was surrounded by a\r\nring of inquiring faces.\r\n\r\nBut there I stood on the rock-edge, looking out across the desert in\r\nsilence. Something in the long, luminous eyes, something in the\r\nsinuous, flying shape had spoken to me intimately, horribly.\r\n\r\nHassan es-Sugra, the headman, touched my arm, and I knew that I must\r\noffer some explanation.\r\n\r\n\"Jackals,\" I said shortly. And with no other word I walked back to my\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nThe night passed without further event, and in the morning we\r\naddressed ourselves to the work with such a will that I saw, to my\r\nsatisfaction, that by noon of the following day the labor of clearing\r\nthe loose sand would be completed.\r\n\r\nDuring the preparation of the evening meal I became aware of a certain\r\ndisquiet in the camp, and I noted a disinclination on the part of the\r\nnative laborers to stray far from the tents. They hung together in a\r\ngroup, and whilst individually they seemed to avoid meeting my eye,\r\ncollectively they watched me in a furtive fashion.\r\n\r\nA gang of Moslem workmen calls for delicate handling, and I wondered\r\nif, inadvertently, I had transgressed in some way their iron-bound\r\ncode of conduct. I called Hassan es-Sugra aside.\r\n\r\n\"What ails the men?\" I asked him. \"Have they some grievance?\"\r\n\r\nHassan spread his palms eloquently.\r\n\r\n\"If they have,\" he replied, \"they are secret about it, and I am not in\r\ntheir confidence. Shall I thrash three or four of them in order to\r\nlearn the nature of this grievance?\"\r\n\r\n\"No thanks all the same,\" I said, laughing at this characteristic\r\nproposal. \"If they refuse to work to-morrow, there will be time enough\r\nfor you to adopt those measures.\"\r\n\r\nOn this, the third night of my sojourn in the Holy Valley by the\r\nTemple of Hatasu, I slept soundly and uninterruptedly. I had been\r\nlooking forward with the keenest zest to the morrow's work, which\r\npromised to bring me within sight of my goal, and when Hassan came to\r\nawaken me, I leaped out of bed immediately.\r\n\r\nHassan es-Sugra, having performed his duty, did not, as was his\r\ncustom, retire; he stood there, a tall, angular figure, looking at me\r\nstrangely.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"There is trouble,\" was his simple reply. \"Follow me, Neville\r\nEffendi.\"\r\n\r\nWondering greatly, I followed him across the plateau and down the\r\nslope to the excavation. There I pulled up short with a cry of\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nCondor's shaft was filled in to the very top, and presented, to my\r\nastonished gaze, much the same aspect that had greeted me upon my\r\nfirst arrival!\r\n\r\n\"The men----\" I began.\r\n\r\nHassan es-Sugra spread wide his palms.\r\n\r\n\"Gone!\" he replied. \"Those Coptic dogs, those eaters of carrion, have\r\nfled in the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this\"--I pointed to the little mound of broken granite and\r\nsand--\"is their work?\"\r\n\r\n\"So it would seem,\" was the reply; and Hassan sniffed his sublime\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nI stood looking bitterly at this destruction of my toils. The\r\nstrangeness of the thing at the moment did not strike me, in my anger;\r\nI was only concerned with the outrageous impudence of the missing\r\nworkmen, and if I could have laid hands upon one of them it had surely\r\ngone hard with him.\r\n\r\nAs for Hassan es-Sugra, I believe he would cheerfully have broken the\r\nnecks of the entire gang. But he was a man of resource.\r\n\r\n\"It is so newly filled in,\" he said, \"that you and I, in three days,\r\nor in four, can restore it to the state it had reached when those\r\nnameless dogs, who regularly prayed with their shoes on, those\r\ndevourers of pork, began their dirty work.\"\r\n\r\nHis example was stimulating. _I_ was not going to be beaten, either.\r\n\r\nAfter a hasty breakfast, the pair of us set to work with pick and\r\nshovel and basket. We worked as those slaves must have worked whose\r\ntoil was directed by the lash of the Pharaoh's overseer. My back\r\nacquired an almost permanent crook, and every muscle in my body seemed\r\nto be on fire. Not even in the midday heat did we slacken or stay our\r\ntoils; and when dusk fell that night a great mound had arisen beside\r\nCondor's shaft, and we had excavated to a depth it had taken our gang\r\ndouble the time to reach.\r\n\r\nWhen at last we threw down our tools in utter exhaustion, I held out\r\nmy hand to Hassan, and wrung his brown fist enthusiastically. His eyes\r\nsparkled as he met my glance.\r\n\r\n\"Neville Effendi,\" he said, \"you are a true Moslem!\"\r\n\r\nAnd only the initiated can know how high was the compliment conveyed.\r\n\r\nThat night I slept the sleep of utter weariness, yet it was not a\r\ndreamless sleep, or perhaps it was not so deep as I supposed, for\r\nblazing cat-eyes encircled me in my dreams, and a constant feline\r\nhowling seemed to fill the night.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke the sun was blazing down upon the rock outside my tent,\r\nand, springing out of bed, I perceived, with amazement, that the\r\nmorning was far advanced. Indeed, I could hear the distant voices of\r\nthe donkey-boys and other harbingers of the coming tourists.\r\n\r\nWhy had Hassan es-Sugra not awakened me?\r\n\r\nI stepped out of the tent and called him in a loud voice. There was\r\nno reply. I ran across the plateau to the edge of the hollow.\r\n\r\nCondor's shaft had been reclosed to the top!\r\n\r\nLanguage fails me to convey the wave of anger, amazement, incredulity,\r\nwhich swept over me. I looked across to the deserted camp and back to\r\nmy own tent; I looked down at the mound, where but a few hours before\r\nhad been a pit, and seriously I began to question whether I was mad or\r\nwhether madness had seized upon all who had been with me. Then, pegged\r\ndown upon the heap of broken stones, I perceived, fluttering, a small\r\npiece of paper.\r\n\r\nDully I walked across and picked it up. Hassan, a man of some\r\neducation, clearly was the writer. It was a pencil scrawl in doubtful\r\nArabic, and, not without difficulty, I deciphered it as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Fly, Neville Effendi! This is a haunted place!\"\r\n\r\nStanding there by the mound, I tore the scrap of paper into minute\r\nfragments, bitterly casting them from me upon the ground. It was\r\nincredible; it was insane.\r\n\r\nThe man who had written that absurd message, the man who had undone\r\nhis own work, had the reputation of being fearless and honorable. He\r\nhad been with me before a score of times, and had quelled petty\r\nmutinies in the camp in a manner which marked him a born overseer. I\r\ncould not understand; I could scarcely believe the evidence of my own\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\nWhat did I do?\r\n\r\nI suppose there are some who would have abandoned the thing at once\r\nand for always, but I take it that the national traits are strong\r\nwithin me. I went over to the camp and prepared my own breakfast;\r\nthen, shouldering pick and shovel, I went down into the valley and\r\nset to work. What ten men could not do, what two men had failed to do,\r\none man was determined to do.\r\n\r\nIt was about half an hour after commencing my toils, and when, I\r\nsuppose, the surprise and rage occasioned by the discovery had begun\r\nto wear off, that I found myself making comparisons between my own\r\ncase and that of Condor. It became more and more evident to me that\r\nevents--mysterious events--were repeating themselves.\r\n\r\nThe frightful happenings attendant upon Condor's death were marshaling\r\nin my mind. The sun was blazing down upon me, and distant voices could\r\nbe heard in the desert stillness. I knew that the plain below was\r\ndotted with pleasure-seeking tourists, yet nervous tremors shook me.\r\nFrankly, I dreaded the coming of the night.\r\n\r\nWell, tenacity or pugnacity conquered, and I worked on until dusk. My\r\nsupper despatched, I sat down on my bed and toyed with the Browning.\r\n\r\nI realized already that sleep, under existing conditions, was\r\nimpossible. I perceived that on the morrow I must abandon my one-man\r\nenterprise, pocket my pride, in a sense, and seek new assistants, new\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nThe fact was coming home to me conclusively that a menace, real and\r\nnot mythical, hung over that valley. Although, in the morning sunlight\r\nand filled with indignation, I had thought contemptuously of Hassan\r\nes-Sugra, now, in the mysterious violet dusk so conducive to calm\r\nconsideration, I was forced to admit that he was at least as brave a\r\nman as I. And he had fled! What did that night hold in keeping for me?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI will tell you what occurred, and it is the only explanation I have\r\nto give of why Condor's shaft, said to communicate with the real tomb\r\nof Hatasu, to this day remains unopened.\r\n\r\nThere, on the edge of my bed, I sat far into the night, not daring to\r\nclose my eyes. But physical weariness conquered in the end, and,\r\nalthough I have no recollection of its coming, I must have succumbed\r\nto sleep, since I remember--can never forget--a repetition of the\r\ndream, or what I had assumed to be a dream, of the night before.\r\n\r\nA ring of blazing green eyes surrounded me. At one point this ring was\r\nbroken, and in a kind of nightmare panic I leaped at that promise of\r\nsafety, and found myself outside the tent.\r\n\r\nLithe, slinking shapes hemmed me in--cat shapes, ghoul shapes,\r\nveritable figures of the pit. And the eyes, the shapes, although they\r\nwere the eyes and shapes of cats, sometimes changed elusively, and\r\nbecame the wicked eyes and the sinuous, writhing shapes of women.\r\nAlways the ring was incomplete, and always I retreated in the only\r\ndirection by which retreat was possible. I retreated from those\r\ncat-things.\r\n\r\nIn this fashion I came at last to the shaft, and there I saw the tools\r\nwhich I had left at the end of my day's toil.\r\n\r\nLooking around me, I saw also, with such a pang of horror as I cannot\r\nhope to convey to you, that the ring of green eyes was now unbroken\r\nabout me.\r\n\r\nAnd it was closing in.\r\n\r\nNameless feline creatures were crowding silently to the edge of the\r\npit, some preparing to spring down upon me where I stood. A voice\r\nseemed to speak in my brain; it spoke of capitulation, telling me to\r\naccept defeat, lest, resisting, my fate be the fate of Condor.\r\n\r\nPeals of shrill laughter rose upon the silence. The laughter was mine.\r\n\r\nFilling the night with this hideous, hysterical merriment, I was\r\nworking feverishly with pick and with shovel filling in the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe end? The end is that I awoke, in the morning, lying, not on my\r\nbed, but outside on the plateau, my hands torn and bleeding and every\r\nmuscle in my body throbbing agonisingly. Remembering my dream--for\r\neven in that moment of awakening I thought I had dreamed--I staggered\r\nacross to the valley of the excavation.\r\n\r\nCondor's shaft was reclosed to the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nPOMEGRANATE FLOWER\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThere are not so many _Antereeyeh_ (story-tellers) in Cairo now (said\r\nmy acquaintance, Hassan of the Scent Bazaar, staring, reflectively, at\r\ntwo American ladies paying fabulous prices for the goods of his\r\nmendacious neighbor on the left). They have adopted other, and more\r\nlucrative, professions; but in my father's time, it was an excellent\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, the stories which you call the _Arabian Nights_ are\r\nno longer recited, because they are said to be unlucky. This has\r\nconsiderably reduced the story-teller's stock-in-trade; for unless\r\na man is blessed with much originality, he cannot well refrain from\r\nusing in his narratives some part of the thousand and one tales.\r\n\r\nTo this day, however, there is in the city of Cairo a tale-teller of\r\nmuch repute. With his tale-telling he combines the profession of a\r\nbarber; and like the famous barber of the _Arabian Nights_ bears the\r\nnickname Es-Samit (the Silent). An old man is this Es-Samit, who no\r\nmore will know his ninetieth year, of dark countenance, and white\r\nbeard and eyebrows, with small ears like the ears of a gazelle, and\r\na long nose like that of a camel, and a haughty aspect. This barber\r\nenjoys every comfort in his declining years by reason of his amusing\r\nmanner, and because his ridiculous stories and disclosures respecting\r\nhis six brothers (for in all things he resembles, or claims to\r\nresemble, his famous namesake) divert all who hear them, causing him\r\nwhose bosom is contracted with woe to swoon with excessive laughter,\r\nand filling the saddest heart with joy; such is the absurd loquacity\r\nand impertinence of the barber called Es-Samit, the Silent.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day that I found myself at the wedding festivities of a\r\nprosperous merchant distantly related to me; and for the entertainment\r\nof his guests, this wealthy man, in addition to the usual dances and\r\nsongs, had engaged Es-Samit to divert us with one of his untruthful\r\nstories. In order to refresh the _Anteree's_ mendacity, the host thus\r\naddressed the barber--\r\n\r\n\"O Es-Samit, thou silent one! it hath come to my ears that in thine\r\nexceeding paucity of speech thou hast omitted, hitherto, to relate the\r\nstory of thy seventh brother. Since thou hast a seventh brother, let\r\nnot thy love of silence (in thee even greater than in thy famous\r\nancestor) deprive us of a knowledge of his depravity, but acquaint us\r\nwith his case.\"\r\n\r\n\"O Merchant Prince!\" replied the barber, \"to none other than\r\nthyself--so handsome, so liberal, and of such excellent\r\nmorality--would I break my vow, to speak of that wretched villain,\r\nthat malevolent mule, that vilest of the vile, my twin brother\r\nAhzab.\"\r\n\r\nMy cousin, feigning astonishment at the manner of his speech, said--\r\n\r\n\"Thy twin brother, O Es-Samit, was not, like thee, a man of rectitude,\r\nof exalted mind, and of enlightened intelligence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" replied the barber, \"he was a dog of the most mongrel kind. My\r\nbosom is pierced when I utter his accursed name! At the hands of\r\nAhzab, my twin brother, I met with every indignity, and with penalties\r\nof a most unfortunate description.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the host heard this, he laughed exceedingly, saying--\r\n\r\n\"Acquaint us, O Es-Samit, with his shameless misdeeds.\"\r\n\r\nThe barber, sighing as though his soul sought rest from all earthly\r\nafflictions, proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKnow, O light of my eyes! that my other brother, Ahzab, was born in\r\nthe city of Cairo, and his birth was unattended by a darkening of the\r\nsun and other unpleasant calamities only by reason of the fact that\r\n_I_ was born in the same hour!\r\n\r\nMy twin brother, Ahzab, was blessed with handsome stature, an elegant\r\nshape, a perfect figure, with cheeks like roses, with eyebrows meeting\r\nabove an aquiline nose brightly shining. In short, this shame of my\r\nmother was endowed with all those perfections which Allah (whose name\r\nbe exalted) had also bestowed upon me; but his heart was the heart of\r\na serpent, and he lacked the nobility of mind which thou hast\r\nobserved in thy servant, O Paragon, of wisdom!\r\n\r\nWhen we were yet in the bloom and blossom of handsome youth, a dispute\r\narose between us, and for many moons I saw not Ahzab, but pursued my\r\noccupation as a barber and teller of wonderful stories in a distant\r\npart of the city. In this way it befell that I knew of his state only\r\nby report, until one day as I sat before my shop observing if the\r\nascendent of the hour were favorable to one who waited to be shaved,\r\nthere came to me a negro most handsomely dressed, who said:\r\n\r\n\"My Master, Ahzab the Merchant, desires that you repair as soon as\r\npossible to his magazine. He hath urgent need of thee.\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing these words, and observing the richness of the negro's\r\napparel, I perceived that those reports which had come to me,\r\nrespecting Ahzab's wealth, were no more than true; and I spoke thus to\r\nmyself:\r\n\r\n\"Within the vilest heart may bloom the flower of brotherly affection.\r\nAhzab desires to share with me, the most enlightened of his family,\r\nthis good fortune which hath befallen him.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I shut up my shop, dismissing the one who waited to be\r\nshaved, and followed the black to the Khân Khalîl, where were the\r\nshops of the wealthy silk merchants. My brother received me\r\naffectionately, embracing me and saying:\r\n\r\n\"O Es-Samit, ever have I loved thee. Lo! Thou growest more like myself\r\neach year. Save that thou art more dignified and noble. Enter into\r\nthis private apartment with me, for it is important that no one shall\r\nsee thee.\"\r\n\r\nMuch surprised at his words, I followed him to an elegant apartment\r\nabove the shop, and there he ordered the servants to roast a lamb and\r\nto bring to us fruit and wine; and while we thus pleasantly employed\r\nourselves, he unfolded to me his case.\r\n\r\n\"Know, O my brother, that I have accumulated great wealth; and this\r\nI have done by observing those wise precepts of conduct laid down by\r\nthee. By the charm of my speech, which I have fashioned upon thine,\r\nand the elegance of my manner, in which I have, though poorly,\r\nimitated thine own, and by the dignity and the modesty of my conduct,\r\nI have endeared all hearts and am esteemed above all the other\r\nmerchants in Cairo.\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary that I repair to Damascus, and during my absence I\r\nwish nothing better than that thou shouldst take my place here. This\r\nwill be favorable to both of us; for I will reward thy services with\r\nfive hundred piastres and an interest in my affairs, and thou wilt\r\npass for me; for all will say, 'Lo! Ahzab the Merchant waxes more\r\nhandsome each day; such is the benign influence of righteous\r\nprosperity and conscious rectitude!' My affairs stand thus and thus,\r\nand my steward, who will be in our confidences, will acquaint thee\r\nwith all matters necessary. Thou wilt wear my costly garments, and sit\r\nin my shop. Each evening thou wilt secretly repair to thine own\r\nabode.\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing those words, my bosom swelled with joy; for I observed\r\nthat Ahzab had not failed to perceive my exalted qualities. We sat\r\nfar into the night in conversation respecting our plans; and on the\r\nfollowing day, Ahzab having departed secretly for Damascus, I repaired\r\nto his shop, as arranged, and took my seat there.\r\n\r\nBy the number of the persons who saluted me, and by the manner of\r\ntheir speech, I perceived, more and more, the great prosperity of\r\nmy brother; and being of a thoughtful mind, I passed the days very\r\npleasantly in contemplation of my good fortune.\r\n\r\nUpon the fourth day after the departure of my brother, as I sat in his\r\nshop, there came past a damsel accompanied by female attendants. This\r\ndamsel was riding upon a mule with a richly embroidered saddle, with\r\nstirrups of gold, and she was covered with an _izar_ of exquisite\r\nfabric; and about her slender waist was a girdle of gold-embroidered\r\nsilk. I was stricken speechless with the beauty and elegance of her\r\nform; and when she alighted and came into the shop, the odors of sweet\r\nperfumes were diffused from her, and she captivated my reason by her\r\nloveliness.\r\n\r\nSeating herself beside me, she raised her _izar_, and I beheld her\r\nblack eyes. And they surpassed in beauty the eyes of all human beings,\r\nand were like the eyes of the gazelle. She had a mouth like the Seal\r\nof Suleyman, and hair blacker than the night of affliction; a forehead\r\nlike the new moon of Ramadan, and cheeks like anemones, with lips\r\nfresher than rose petals, teeth like pearls from the sea of\r\ndistraction, and a neck surpassing in whiteness molten silver, above\r\na form that put to shame the willow branch.\r\n\r\nShe spoke to me, saying:\r\n\r\n\"O Ahzab! I have returned as I promised thee!\"\r\n\r\nAt the sound of her voice, by Allah (whose name be exalted!) I was\r\nentangled in the snare of her love; fire was burning up my heart on\r\nher account; a consuming flame increased within my bosom, and my\r\nreason was drowned in the sea of my desire.\r\n\r\nPerceiving my state, she quickly lowered her veil in pretended\r\ndispleasure, and desired to look at some pieces of silk. While she\r\nthus employed herself, she surpassed the branches in the beauty of\r\nher bending motions, and my eyes could not remove themselves from\r\nher. I thus communed with myself:\r\n\r\n\"O Es-Samit, thou didst contract with thy brother to do this and that,\r\nand to render unto him a proper account of thy dealings. But though\r\nhe hath made thee no mention of his affair with this damsel--it is\r\nimportant that thou conductest this matter as he would have done, so\r\nthat he cannot reproach thee with negligence!\" For I was ever a just\r\nas well as a discreet and silent man.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"O my mistress, who art the most lovely person God has created, rend\r\nnot my heart with thy displeasure, but take pity upon me. Know that\r\nlove is difficult, and the concealment of it melteth iron and\r\noccasioneth disease and infirmity. Thou hast returned as thou didst\r\npromise; therefore I conjure thee, conceal not thy face from thy\r\nslave!\"\r\n\r\nThe damsel thereupon raised her head and put aside her veil, casting\r\na glance upon me and looked sideways at the attendants, and placed one\r\nfinger upon her lips; so that I knew her to be as discreet as she was\r\nlovely. She laughed in my face, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I will take this piece of embroidered silk that I have chosen. What\r\nis the price?\"\r\n\r\nAnd I answered:\r\n\r\n\"One hundred piasters; but I pray thee let it be thine, and a gift\r\nfrom Ahzab!\"\r\n\r\nUpon this, she looked into my eyes and the sight of her face drew from\r\nme a thousand sighs, and took the silk, saying:\r\n\r\n\"O my master, leave me not desolate!\"\r\n\r\nSo she departed, while I continued sitting in the market-street until\r\npast the hour of afternoon prayer, with disturbed mind enslaved by her\r\nbeauty and loveliness. I returned to my house and supper was placed\r\nbefore me, but reflecting upon the damsel, I could eat nothing. I laid\r\nmyself down to rest, but passed the whole night sleepless, communing\r\nwith myself how I could best carry out this affair and obtain\r\npossession of the damsel ... for my brother, Ahzab!\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nScarcely had daybreak appeared when I arose and repaired to the\r\nmarket-place and put on a suit of my brother's clothing, richer and\r\nmore magnificent than that I had worn the day before; and having drunk\r\na cup of wine, I sat in the shop. But all that day she came not, nor\r\nthe next, but upon the third day she came again, attended only by one\r\nattendant, and she saluted me and said in a speech never surpassed in\r\nsoftness and sweetness:\r\n\r\n\"O my master, reproach me not that I thus reveal the interest I have\r\nin thee, but I could not speak to thee when my women were in hearing;\r\nand this one is in my confidence. I have told thee that my father will\r\nnever give me to thee because of my rank, but thou hast wounded my\r\nheart, and more and more do I love thee each day--for each day thou\r\ngrowest more beautiful and elegant. Forever I must be desolate. Alas!\r\nI have placed thy letter in the box thou didst give me, and no day\r\npasses that it is not wet with my tears. Farewell! O my beloved!\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, my love and passion grew so violent that I almost\r\nbecame insensible. The damsel rose to leave the shop, and the one who\r\nwas with her spoke softly in her ear; but she shook her head,\r\nexpressing displeasure, and went away.\r\n\r\nWhen I perceived that indeed she was gone, verily the tears descended\r\nupon my cheek like rain, and my soul had all but departed. My heart\r\nclung to her--I followed in the direction of her steps through the\r\nmarket-place, and lo! the attendant came running back to me, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Here is the message of my mistress: 'Know that my love is greater\r\nthan thine, and on Friday next my servant will come to thee and tell\r\nthee how thou mayest see me for a short interview before my father\r\ncomes back from prayers.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen I heard these words of the girl, the anguish of my heart ceased,\r\nand I was intoxicated with love and rapture, and in my joy and\r\nlonging, I omitted to ask the girl the abode of her mistress--neither\r\ndid I know the name of my beloved; but reflecting upon these matters,\r\nI returned to my brother's shop, and sat there until late, and then I\r\nrepaired secretly to my abode.\r\n\r\nI paused in a quiet street, and seated myself upon a _mastabah_ to\r\nscent the coolness of the air, and to abandon myself to exquisite\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner had I thus seated myself than a negro of gigantic\r\nstature, and most hideous aspect, suddenly appeared from the shadow\r\nof a door, and threw himself upon me, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"This is thine end, as it was written, O Ahzab the Merchant!\"\r\n\r\nBy Allah! (whose name be exalted) I thought it was even as he said;\r\nand none but myself had fallen into sudden dissolution, but that\r\neverything slippery is not a pancake, and the jar that is struck may\r\nyet escape unbroken.\r\n\r\nSo it befell that by great good fortune and by the exercise of my\r\nagility and intelligence, I tripped the negro and his head came in\r\ncontact with the _mastabah_, and before he could recover himself, I\r\nheld to his ebony throat the blade of a razor which, by the mercy of\r\nGod, and because it was a custom of my profession, I carried in my\r\n_kamar_.\r\n\r\n\"O thou dog!\" I exclaimed, \"prepare to depart to that utter darkness\r\nand perdition that awaits assassins! For assuredly I am about to slay\r\nthee!\"\r\n\r\nBut he humbled himself to the ground before me, and embraced my feet,\r\ncrying:\r\n\r\n\"Have mercy, O my master! I but obeyed the commands!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of whom, thou vile and unnamable vermin?\" I asked of him.\r\n\r\n\"Of whom else but Abu-el-Hassan, the son of the Kadî! For hath he not\r\nrevealed to thee that for what has passed with Jullanar (Pomegranate\r\nFlower), the daughter of the Walî, he will slay thee?\"\r\n\r\n\"He hath revealed this to me?\" I asked of him, astonished at his\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nAnd he replied: \"Thou knowest, master, it was by my hand that the\r\nmessage was borne.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon I praised Allah (whose name be exalted) and spurned the\r\nslave with my foot, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Depart, O thou black son of filth, and report that I am dead. I give\r\nthee thy wretched life; depart!\"\r\n\r\nBut when he had gone, I again lifted up my voice in thanksgiving. And\r\nhaving come to my abode, I performed the preparatory ablution, and\r\nrecited the prayer of night-fall; after which I recited the chapters\r\n\"Ya-Sîn\" (The Cow) and \"Two Preventatives.\" For I perceived that this\r\nwas the true purport of my brother's absence, and that in his love\r\nand affection he had resigned to me this affair, well knowing that I\r\nshould perish!\r\n\r\nIt was by the mercy of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful, that my\r\ncase was not as he had foreseen. The damsel called Jullanar, daughter\r\nof the Walî, was famed from Cairo to the uttermost islands of China\r\nfor her elegance and loveliness, and I knew that my beloved could be\r\nnone other than she, and that Abu-el-Hassan, son of the Kadî, could be\r\nnone other than the betrothed chosen of her father the Walî.\r\n\r\nI slept not that night, but passed the hours until sunrise reflecting\r\nupon this matter, and upon the dangers which awaited my father's\r\nhandsome son on Friday. And I went not to the market on the next day,\r\nbut sent a message to my brother's steward saying that I was smitten\r\nwith sickness and enjoining him to acquaint the girl, who presently\r\nwould come, where I was to be found.\r\n\r\nThus it befell that at noon on Friday the same girl that had been with\r\nJullanar came to me, sent thither from the shop of Ahzab by the\r\nsteward, saying:\r\n\r\n\"O my master, answer the summons of my mistress. This is the plan that\r\nI have proposed to her: Conceal thyself within one of the large chests\r\nthat are in thy shop, and hire a porter to carry thee to the house of\r\nthe Walî. I will cause the _bowwab_ to admit the chest to the\r\napartment of the Lady Jullanar. She doth trust her honor to thy\r\ndiscretion, by reason of her love for thee, and because she will die\r\nif she see thee not to bid thee farewell. I will arrange for thee to\r\nbe secretly conveyed from the house, ere the Walî returns.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at her words I was like to have swooned with ecstasy; and I\r\nforgot, in the transport of love and delight, the black assassin and\r\nthe threatened vengeance of Abu-el-Hassan. I set at naught my fears at\r\ntrusting my father's favorite son within the walls of the Walî's\r\nhouse. I thought only of Jullanar of the slender waist and heavy hips,\r\nof the dewy lips, more intoxicating than wine, and the eyes of my\r\nbeloved like wells of temptation to swallow up the souls of men.\r\n\r\nI shaved and went to the bath, and repaired to the shop of Ahzab. My\r\nbrother's steward was not there, whereat I rejoiced, and arrayed\r\nmyself in the most splendid suit that I could find, and having\r\nperfumed myself with essences and sweet scents, I summoned a boy and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Go thou and bring here a porter. Order him to carry yon large chest\r\nto the house of the Walî, near the Mosque of Ibn-Mizheh, and ask for\r\nthe lady Jullanar who hath purchased this box and a number of things\r\nwhich are in it. See that he be a strong man, for the box is very\r\nheavy.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy replied, \"On the head,\" and departed on his errand.\r\n\r\nThereupon I commended my soul to Allah, and entered the box, closing\r\nthe lid upon me. Scarcely had I concealed myself, when the porter\r\nentered and lifted the chest. The boy assisted him to take it upon\r\nhis back, and he bore it out into the market-street.\r\n\r\n\"Now by the beard of the Prophet (on whom be peace),\" I exclaimed to\r\nmyself, \"it is well that I am named Es-Samit, the Silent; for had it\r\nbeen otherwise, I must have lifted up my voice against this son of\r\nperdition who carries me with my soles raised to heaven!\"\r\n\r\nThe porter conveyed me for some distance, panting beneath the weight\r\nof the box, and, presently, coming to a _mastabah_, dropped one end\r\nof the box upon it, whilst he rested himself.\r\n\r\n\"Now as Allah is great, and Mohammed his only prophet,\" I said in my\r\nbeard, \"I am fortunate in that I have acquired a paucity of diction.\r\nThere is no other in Cairo, but the joy of my mother, that could\r\nrefrain from speech when dropped upon his skull on a stone bench!\"\r\n\r\nAfter a while, the porter raised the chest again, and resumed his\r\njourney, presently coming to the house of the Walî, and dropping the\r\nbox into the courtyard.\r\n\r\n\"Allah be praised!\" I said. \"For if this porter, whose name be\r\naccursed, did but carry me a quinary further, my silence would become\r\neven more surprising than it is; for my affair would finish, and I\r\nshould speak no more to any man!\"\r\n\r\nThe _bowwab_ now cried out:\r\n\r\n\"What is in this chest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Purchases of the lady Jullanar,\" said the girl, whom I recognized\r\nby her voice. \"Permit the porter to carry it to her apartments.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must obey the orders of the Walî my master,\" replied the\r\ndoor-keeper. \"The box must be opened.\"\r\n\r\nI was bereft of the power to control myself, and seized with a colic\r\nfrom excess of fear; I almost died from the violent spasms of my\r\nlimbs.\r\n\r\n\"O Es-Samit!\" I said, \"this is the reward of him whom love leads to\r\nthe house of the Walî!\"\r\n\r\nI felt certain that my destruction approached. The intoxication of\r\nlove now ceased in me, and reflection came in its place. I repented\r\nof what I had done, and prayed a happy solution of my dangerous case.\r\n\r\nWhether as a result of my prayers, I know not, but some arrangement\r\nwas come to, and the porter once more raised the chest, and, striking\r\nmy head upon the end of it at each step, bore me up to the apartments\r\nof Jullanar, which I thus entered feet first.\r\n\r\nHe deposited the box, lid downward, upon the soft mattress of a\r\n_dîwan_, so that I found myself upon all fours, like a mule with my\r\nface between my hands! Ere I could break my habitual silence, he\r\nlifted some heavy piece of furniture--I know not what--and placed it\r\non top of the box!\r\n\r\nA voice sweeter than the songs of the Daood spoke:\r\n\r\n\"Slave! what art thou doing!\"\r\n\r\n\"I _am_ thy slave!\" spoke another voice, at the accursed sound whereof\r\nI almost died of spleen. \"Knowest thou me not, my beloved? I have\r\ndevised a new stratagem and come to thee in the guise of a porter!\r\nBut lo! beneath my uncomely garments, I am Ahzab, thy lover!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAs a man who sleeps ill after a protracted feast, I heard her answer,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\"Is it true thou hast come to me, or is this a dream?\"\r\n\r\n\"Verily, it is true!\" answered the accursed, the vile, the unspeakable\r\nAhzab, my brother--for it was he. \"From the time when I first saw\r\nthee, neither sleep hath been sweet to me, nor hath wine possessed the\r\nslightest flavor! I have come to thee thus, fragrant bloom of the\r\npomegranate, because I would not have thee see me in a posture so\r\nundignified as that of one crouched in a box! So that thy people might\r\nbe compelled to give me access to thine apartments, I have put a\r\nmendicant in my place, rendering the chest heavy!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she said, \"Thou art welcome!\" and embraced him.\r\n\r\nBy Allah (whose name be exalted), I gnawed my beard until I choked!\r\n\r\n\"Thou art changed, beloved!\" she said to him; \"thou art always\r\nbeautiful, but to-day thou seemest less rosy-cheeked to mine eyes!\"\r\n\r\nThe accursed Ahzab, like an enraged mule, kicked the box wherein\r\nI dissolved in flames of wrath.\r\n\r\n\"I am burnt up with love and longing for thee!\" he replied. \"O my\r\nlove! how beautiful thou art!\"\r\n\r\nWhereat my command of silence forsook me! As Allah is the one god,\r\nand Mohammed his only Prophet, I became as one possessed of a devil!\r\n\r\n\"Robber!\" I cried; and my words lost themselves within the box.\r\n\"Cheat! accursed disgrace of my father! infamy of my race! O dog!\r\nO unutterable dirt!\"\r\n\r\nJullanar cried out in fear, but my accursed brother took her in his\r\nbosom, soothing her with soft words.\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, O my beloved!\" he said. \"I gave the mendicant wine that\r\nhis heart might warm to his lowly task, but I fear he has become\r\nintoxicated!\"\r\n\r\n\"O thou liar!\" I cried. \"O malevolent scoundrel! O son of a disease!\"\r\nAnd with all my strength I sought to raise the weight that bore me\r\ndown; but to no purpose.\r\n\r\n\"Know, my beloved,\" continued my thrice-accursed brother, \"what I have\r\nsuffered on thy account. But three days since I was attacked by four\r\ngigantic negro assassins despatched by Abu-el-Hassan to slay me! But I\r\nvanquished them, killing one and maiming a second, whilst the others\r\nescaped and ran back to their wretched master.\"\r\n\r\n\"O unutterable liar!\" I groaned. For I was near to hastening my\r\npredestined end both from suffocation and consuming rage. \"Thou didst\r\nfly, thou jackal! from that peril, and reapest the fruits of my\r\ncourage and dexterity! O, mud! O, stench!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lest he should despatch a number too great for me to combat, I have\r\nlurked in hiding, delight of souls! in a most filthy hovel belonging\r\nto a barber!\"\r\n\r\n\"May thy tongue turn into a scorpion and bite thee!\" I cried. \"My\r\nabode is as clean as the palace of the Khedive! Thou hast never\r\nentered it, O thou gnat's egg! Thou hast hidden in I know not what\r\nhole, like the unclean insect thou art, until thy steward (may his\r\nbeard grow backward and smother him!) informed thee of this! O Allah!\r\n(to whom be ascribed all might and glory) give me strength to move\r\nthis accursed box that I may crush him!\"\r\n\r\nScarce had I uttered the last word, when a girl came running into the\r\napartment, crying: \"Fly, my master! O my mistress! The Walî! the\r\nWalî!\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing these words, my rage departed from me and in its place\r\ncame excessive fear. My breath left my body, and my heart ceased to\r\nbeat.\r\n\r\n\"He that falleth in the dirt be trodden on by camels,\" I reflected.\r\n\"It is not enough, O Es-Samit, that thou hast suffered the attack of\r\nthe assassin; that thou hast all but died of fear at the door of the\r\nWalî's house; that thou hast been torn from the arms of the loveliest\r\ncreature God hath created; thou are destined, now, O most unfortunate\r\nof men, to be detected by the Walî in his daughter's apartments,\r\nconcealed in a box!\"\r\n\r\nAnd I pronounced the _Takbîr_, crying, \"O Allah! thy ways are\r\ninscrutable!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fly, my beloved!\" cried Jullanar to Ahzab. \"My women will conceal\r\nthee!\" Wherewith she swooned and fell upon the floor senseless.\r\n\r\n\"Quick! follow me closely, O my master!\" cried the girl, and I heard\r\nmy perfidious brother depart from the room by one door, as the Walî\r\nentered by another.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried the Walî, clapping his hands. \"Slaves! what is this?\"\r\n\r\nAnd people came running to his command; some carrying out the lady\r\nJullanar to her sleeping apartment, and sprinkling rose-water upon\r\nher, and some remaining.\r\n\r\n\"What is in this box upon the _dîwan_!\" demanded the Walî. \"Bring it\r\nhither and open it!\"\r\n\r\nAt that I knew that I was lost, and my soul as good as departed, and\r\nI bade farewell to life and invoked Mohammed (whom may God preserve)\r\nto intercede for me that I might die an easy death.\r\n\r\nThe chest was dragged into the middle of the floor and thrown open.\r\n\r\n\"Name of my mother!\" exclaimed the Walî. \"It is Ahzab the Merchant! It\r\nis the villain who hath presumed to make love to my daughter! O Allah!\r\nmy daughter hath disgraced me! By the beard of the Prophet, I can no\r\nmore hold up my head among honest men!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he slapped his face and plucked his beard, and fell insensible\r\nupon the floor. As he did so, I leaped from the box and would have\r\nescaped, but two blacks seized me; and the noise, or the refreshing\r\nquality of the rose-water with which the women were sprinkling him,\r\nrevived the Walî, who recovered, fixing upon me a terrible gaze.\r\n\r\n\"O thou dog!\" he said; \"thou who hast wrought my disgrace! As thou\r\ndidst enter my house in yonder box, in yonder box shalt thou quit the\r\nworld! Cast him back again, fasten the box with ropes, and throw it\r\ninto the Nile at nightfall!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNow were my powers of silence most surprisingly displayed. For I spoke\r\nno word, but dumb as a tongueless man, I allowed myself to be knocked\r\nbackward into the box. The lid closed upon me, ropes bound about the\r\nbox, and the seal of the Walî affixed to it. Negroes carried it out,\r\nand threw it into some cellar to await nightfall.\r\n\r\n\"O Es-Samit!\" I said, \"this is the end that was appointed to thy\r\nfather's wisest son! To this pass thy silence and wisdom have brought\r\nthee! O Allah (to whom be all glory), grant that one of the fishes\r\nthat eat me in the Nile shall be served up to Ahzab, my twin brother,\r\nand choke him!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then my thoughts turned to Jullanar, and I sighed and groaned;\r\nand the torments I suffered through lying drawn up in the box were\r\ndelights to the agonies that my reflections respecting her case\r\noccasioned in me; so that, with the excess of my woe and misery,\r\nI became insensible. How long I remained so I know not, but I was\r\nawakened by a knocking at the lid of the box, and the voice of the\r\nWalî spoke, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Prepare to die, O wretch! for my servants are about to convey thee\r\nto the river and cast thee in! Thou dog! who didst presume to raise\r\nthine eyes to my daughter!--know that this is the reward of such\r\nmalefactors; for assuredly if thou escapest alive, thou shalt wed\r\nJullanar!\"\r\n\r\nWhereat he laughed until he almost swooned and kicked the box until\r\nI thought he had burst it. Blacks raised me, and I was borne down a\r\nlong flight of steps and onward in I know not what direction.\r\n\r\n\"From here?\" said one of them, and through a crack in the lid, I saw\r\nthe light of a torch, and the whispering of the river came to my ears.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" replied another.\r\n\r\nAnd I commended my soul to Allah as the box was swung to and fro and\r\nhurled through the air. With a sound in my ears as of the shrieking\r\nof ten thousand _efreets_, I was plunged into the water!\r\n\r\nFar under the surface I went and knew all the agonies of dissolution;\r\nbut the box was strongly and cunningly made and rose again; then it\r\nbegan to fill and sink once more, and again I tasted of the final\r\npangs. Throughout all this time, a strong current was bearing the box\r\nalong, and presently, as, for the fiftieth occasion, I was seeking to\r\ndie and to end my misery, I heard voices.\r\n\r\nThe most miserable life is sweet to him who feels it slipping from his\r\ngrasp, and I summoned sufficient strength to raise a feeble cry.\r\n\r\n\"O Allah!\" I cried, \"if it be thy will, grant that these persons whose\r\nvoices I hear take pity upon my unfortunate condition, and draw me\r\nforth.\"\r\n\r\nEven as I spoke, something stayed the onward progress of the box. It\r\nwas a fisherman's net! And the fishermen began to draw me into the\r\nboat, I praising Allah the while.\r\n\r\nBut when they had the box upon the edge of the boat, and heard my\r\nvoice proceeding from within, and saw the Walî's seal upon the\r\nlid--\"By the beard of the Prophet!\" cried one, \"this is some evil\r\n_ginn_ or magician whom the Walî hath imprisoned in this chest! Allah\r\navert the omen! Cast him back, comrades!\"\r\n\r\nAlas! I could find no words wherewith to entreat them to take pity;\r\nnever had paucity of speech served me so ill! A great groan issued\r\nfrom my bosom as I was consigned again to the Nile!\r\n\r\nAllah is great, and it was not written that I should perish in that\r\nmanner. For another current now seized upon the box, and just as I was\r\non the point of dissolution, cast it upon a projecting bank, where it\r\nwas perceived by a band of four robbers, who derived a livelihood from\r\nplundering such vessels as lay unprotected in the river.\r\n\r\nThese waded out and dragged the box ashore. I was too near my end to\r\nhave spoken had I desired to speak, but from my unfortunate adventure\r\nwith the fishermen, I had learned that silence was wisdom, now as\r\nalways. Thus I lay in the box like a dog that has been all but\r\ndrowned, and listened to the words of my rescuers.\r\n\r\nThese were arguing respecting the contents and value of the box, one\r\nholding this opinion and another that. One, who seemed to be their\r\nleader, was about to unfasten the ropes, but another claimed that\r\nthis was his due. So, from angry words, they came to blows, and by the\r\ngrace of God (whose name be exalted) they drew their knives, and three\r\nof the four were slain. The fourth removed the ropes and opened the\r\nbox, thinking to enjoy, alone, the treasures which he supposed it to\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\nWhereupon I uprose and looked up to where Canopus shone, and said:\r\n\r\n\"There is no God but God! Praise be to Allah who has preserved me\r\nfrom an unfortunate and unseemly end!\"\r\n\r\nAt that, the robber, with wild cries of fear, turned and ran, and I\r\nsaw him no more. Such, O bountiful patron, is the disgraceful story\r\nof the dog Ahzab, my seventh and twin brother. But all that which I\r\nendured happened by Fate and Destiny, and from that which is written\r\nthere is no escape nor flight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur worthy host (concluded Hassan) laughed heartily at this story,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\"O Es-Samit, it is evident to me that thy paucity of speech alone\r\npreserved thee from drowning! But acquaint us, I beg, with the fate\r\nof thy dog of a brother, and of thy beautiful Pomegranate Flower.\"\r\n\r\n\"O glory of beholders!\" replied the barber, \"by the mouth of the girl\r\nwho was in Jullanar's confidence--Ahzab, that shame of mules, learned,\r\nwhilst in hiding, how the Walî had said in the presence of many\r\nwitnesses: 'Assuredly if thou escapest alive, thou shalt wed\r\nJullanar.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Tellest thou me that he had the effrontery to demand the fulfilment\r\nof a pledge so spoken, O Es-Samit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" replied the barber, with tears pouring like rain down the\r\nwrinkles of his aged cheek, \"he lived with her the most joyous, and\r\nmost agreeable, and most comfortable, and most pleasant life, until\r\nthey were visited by the terminator of delights, and the separator\r\nof companions!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n         *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following printer's errors have been corrected in the text:\r\n\r\n  Page 16, passsd amended to passed (passed through the finger ring)\r\n  Page 16, instrinsic amended to intrinsic (Its intrinsic value)\r\n  Page 20, whcih amended to which (for which I would gladly)\r\n  Page 26, wordly amended to worldly (terminated my worldly affairs)\r\n  Page 42, remakable amended to remarkable (taciturnity was remarkable)\r\n  Page 42, dsitinguished amended to distinguished (behavior was\r\n    distinguished)\r\n  Page 46, exhausing amended to exhausting (journey had been most\r\n    exhausting)\r\n  Page 87, Suit amended to Suite (Harêm Suite is occupied)\r\n  Page 89, releived amended to relieved (relieved by a small snowy\r\n    turban)\r\n  Page 98, bougainvillia replaced with bougainvillea (bougainvillea\r\n    blossom)\r\n  Page 104, veiled amended to Veiled (features of the Veiled Prophet)\r\n  Page 112, Chundermyer amended to Chundermeyer (Mr. Chundermeyer\r\n    gagged)\r\n  Page 115, partciular compositoin amended to particular composition\r\n    (particular composition of the perfume)\r\n  Page 130, oportunity ammended to opportunity (the seeming opportunity)\r\n  Page 130, cheecks amended to cheeks (my cheeks were burning)\r\n  Page 149, Abî ammended to Abû (Abû Tabâh assured me)\r\n  Page 149, alhtough amended to although (although she who is)\r\n  Page 152, folowing amended to following (on the following morning)\r\n  Page 158, met amended to me (invited me to visit)\r\n  Page 160, acess amended to access (door giving access to)\r\n  Page 175, pantomine amended to pantomime (grotesque kind of pantomime)\r\n  Page 222, tesitfy amended to testify (as I can testify)\r\n  Page 243, cresent amended to crescent (crescent of Islâm)\r\n  Page 250, menioned amended to mentioned (which I have mentioned)\r\n  Page 275, severly amended to severely (The features were severely)\r\n  Page 280, incliniation amended to inclination (I felt little\r\n    inclination)\r\n  Page 301, sumons amended to summons (summons of my mistress)\r\n  Page 306, dexerity amended to dexterity (my courage and dexterity)\r\n  Page 311, bossom amended to bosom (groan issued from my bosom)",
