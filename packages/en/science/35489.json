On the 18th of February, 1564, Michael Angelo Buonarotti\r\nclosed his eyes at Rome, and Galileo Galilei first saw the light at\r\nPisa.\"\r\n\r\nThus writes young Karl von Gebler, in the best life of Galileo ever\r\nwritten, his dying contribution to literature. Some other authorities\r\nplace Galileo's birth on February 15.\r\n\r\nHe was the oldest in a family of five children born to Vincenzo Galilei,\r\na Florentine noble, and Giulia Ammanati, who also belonged to an ancient\r\nfamily. Vincenzo wrote learnedly about music, and taught his boy to play\r\non the lute and the organ; but he was poor and life was a struggle.\r\nHowever beneficial poverty may be in the development of character, most\r\nof us do not crave it for our children, so Vincenzo decided to place his\r\nson where he could earn a comfortable support. Music did not bring\r\nmoney. Galileo therefore should become a dealer in cloth; a necessity\r\nof life, rather than a luxury.\r\n\r\nBut the boy soon showed great skill in music, surpassing his father. He\r\nexcelled in drawing and color, and could have become a noted artist. He\r\nloved poetry, and had a decided taste for mechanics, making machines of\r\ngreat ingenuity. It soon became evident that such a lad would not be\r\nsatisfied to spend his life trading in wool.\r\n\r\nHe must be educated, but how? The family had moved from Pisa, where\r\nthere were schools of repute, to Florence. An effort had to be made, by\r\nthe greatest economy, to prepare Galileo to go back to the Pisan\r\nUniversity. He showed great aptitude for Latin and Greek, and at\r\nseventeen was ready for Pisa.\r\n\r\nFor what profession should he study? Not what best suited his tastes,\r\nbut that in which his father thought he could make money, medicine. Poor\r\nVincenzo! who can blame him that he hated poverty for his brilliant son?\r\n\r\nAt college, Galileo became an ardent student of philosophy, and because\r\nhe dared to think for himself, and did not always agree with the\r\nteachings of Aristotle, he was called \"the wrangler.\" Until he was\r\ntwenty he was scarcely acquainted with the rudiments of mathematics,\r\nbecause his father thought this study was a waste of time for a man who\r\nwas to become a physician. How many parents make the mistake of bending\r\ntheir children to their own plans, instead of ascertaining what a boy\r\nor girl can do best in the world, and then fitting him or her for it!\r\n\r\nWhile Galileo was studying medicine in Pisa, boarding with a relative,\r\nthe court of Tuscany came to the city for a few months. Among the suite\r\nwas Ostilio Ricci, a distinguished mathematician, and Governor of the\r\nPages of the Grand Ducal Court. He was a friend of the Galilei family,\r\nand was pleased to see the bright young son, Galileo. When he taught\r\nEuclid, the medical student would stand shyly at the schoolroom door,\r\nand listen with intense interest. Soon he began to study mathematics\r\nsecretly; then begged Ricci to teach him, who gladly consented, till the\r\nfather forbade it, seeing that Euclid interfered with medicine.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the youth of nineteen, kneeling at prayers in the Pisa\r\nCathedral, had dreamily watched a bronze lamp swinging from an arch. The\r\noscillations were at first considerable, but as they grew less and less,\r\nGalileo observed that they were all performed in the same time,\r\nmeasuring the time by feeling his pulse. The idea occurred to him that\r\nan instrument could be constructed which should mark the rate and\r\nvariation of the pulse. He began to experiment, and soon invented the\r\npulselogia, which the physicians hailed with great delight. The pendulum\r\nwas not applied to clocks till a half-century later, but its invention\r\nattracted the attention of all scholars.\r\n\r\nAfter four years' residence at Pisa, Vincenzo Galilei appealed to the\r\nreigning Grand Duke, Ferdinand de Medici, to grant to his son one of the\r\nforty free places founded for poor students, but the request was denied,\r\nand Galileo, unable to pay for his doctor's degree, was obliged to leave\r\nthe university without it. Already he had learned bitter lessons of\r\nprivation and disappointment, but youth has a brave heart, and looks\r\never toward the sunlight.\r\n\r\nHe went back to his home in Florence to study the works of Archimedes,\r\nwhom he called his \"master,\" to write his first essay on his Hydrostatic\r\nBalance, and to earn the reputation of a bold inquirer in geometrical\r\nand mechanical speculations. The father had now given up all hope of a\r\nfortune coming through medicine! Henceforward, the genius which was to\r\nshed lustre on his own name, otherwise buried in obscurity, was to have\r\nits own bent, and work out its own destiny.\r\n\r\nIf we are in earnest, a door opens sooner or later; but our own hands\r\nusually open it. At twenty-four a door opened to Galileo. Marquis\r\nGuidubaldo, a celebrated mathematician, appreciating what the young\r\nscientist had done, began a correspondence with him, and a valuable\r\nfriendship resulted. The marquis asked him to study the position of the\r\ncentre of gravity in solid bodies. Galileo applied himself to it, and\r\nwrote a valuable essay, which waited fifty years for publication.\r\nPerhaps no person can be really great who has not learned patience, and\r\nGalileo had many lessons in this virtue before he died.\r\n\r\nThrough the influence of the marquis, he was brought to the notice of\r\nFerdinand I., reigning Grand Duke, who appointed him to the mathematical\r\nprofessorship at Pisa. This was a great honor for a young man of\r\ntwenty-six, one who had been too poor to take his degree. The salary was\r\nsmall, less than a hundred dollars a year; but he earned somewhat by the\r\npractice of medicine, by lectures on Dante and other literary subjects,\r\nand by lessons to private pupils. Of course, he had little or no\r\nleisure; but he thus learned one of the most valuable lessons of\r\nlife,--to treasure time as though it were gold. How glad his father and\r\nmother must have been that their wool projects had come to naught!\r\n\r\nThe professors at Pisa, with a single exception, Jacopo Mazzoni, in the\r\nchair of philosophy, were opposed to the new-comer. They were all\r\ndisciples of Aristotle, and had not Galileo, when a boy among them,\r\ndared to oppose the great Grecian? And now, to make matters worse, he\r\nhad taken some friends to the top of the Leaning Tower, and had put to\r\nthe test the belief of two thousand years,--that the rate at which a\r\nbody falls depends upon its weight. When the different weights fell to\r\nthe pavement at the foot of the Leaning Tower, at the same time, the\r\nlearned were astonished. If Aristotle could be wrong in one thing, he\r\nmight in others, and this young man would revolutionize the teaching of\r\nthe times!\r\n\r\nThe feeling became so strong against the investigator that after three\r\nyears at Pisa he resigned. When will the world learn toleration for\r\nthose whose opinions are different from the popular thought? From\r\nGalileo to Darwin we have persecuted the men and women whose views were\r\nunlike our own in theology, in science, or in social matters.\r\n\r\nThrough his friend, the Marquis Guidubaldo, the mathematical\r\nprofessorship at Padua was obtained for Galileo. He was now twenty-nine,\r\nand becoming widely known throughout Italy. His father had just died,\r\nleaving the whole family, a wife and four children, dependent upon him\r\nfor support; not a small matter for an ambitious and hard-working\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\nPadua gave the young man cordial welcome. Vincenzo Pinelli, a learned\r\nnobleman, who possessed eighty thousand volumes, mentioned him to Tycho\r\nBrahe, the great Danish astronomer, as a man whom it would be well to\r\ncultivate; but the Dane was too cautious about his own reputation, and\r\ndid not write Galileo till eight years later, and died the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAn associate of Tycho Brahe was wiser than his master, and sent Galileo\r\nhis new book, \"Prodromus Dissertationum Cosmographicum.\" A warm letter\r\nof thanks went back to the immortal John Kepler, saying: \"Many years ago\r\nI became a convert to the opinions of Copernicus, and by that theory\r\nhave succeeded in fully explaining many phenomena which on the contrary\r\nhypothesis are altogether inexplicable. I have drawn up many arguments\r\nand compilations of the opposite opinions, which, however, I have not\r\nhitherto dared to publish, fearful of meeting the same fate as our\r\nmaster Copernicus, who, although he has earned for himself immortal fame\r\namongst the few, yet amongst the greater number appears as only worthy\r\nof hooting and derision; so great is the number of fools.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Kepler, like Galileo, lived a pathetic life. His childhood was\r\nspent in the little beer-shop of his wretchedly poor father. At six he\r\nhad a severe attack of small-pox, and his eyes were permanently\r\nweakened. He was put to the plough, but his delicate body could not bear\r\nthe work. At last, through charity, he became a theological student at\r\nTuebingen. But here he began to think for himself, and, probably, would\r\nhave been obliged to leave the university.\r\n\r\nFortunately for science, he heard some lectures given by Michael\r\nMoestlen, famous in mathematics and astronomy. A new world opened to\r\nKepler. He applied himself with all the ardor of youth, and at\r\ntwenty-two became professor of mathematics at Graetz, in Styria. He was\r\nsoon driven away from this Catholic stronghold, on account of his\r\nProtestant faith. Tycho Brahe heard of his needs, and made him his\r\nassistant at Prague, with a salary of seven hundred and fifty dollars a\r\nyear. This seemed regal splendor to the poor astronomer. Now he studied\r\nthe heavens with hope and delight.\r\n\r\nBut sorrows soon came. His children died, his wife became insane, and\r\ndied also. The salary could not be paid, on account of the religious\r\nwars which convulsed Germany. He wrote almanacs, took private pupils,\r\nand in all ways tried to support his second wife and children, while he\r\nstudied the heavens year by year, discovering his three great laws. The\r\nmathematical calculations for the first law, that the planets move in\r\nelliptical orbits round the sun, which is placed at one of the foci,\r\nfilled seven hundred pages. His \"Harmonies of the World\" contained his\r\nthird great law: \"The squares of the periodic times of the planets are\r\nproportioned to the cubes of their mean distances from the sun.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was his joy when he discovered this law, after seventeen years of\r\nlabor, that he said, \"I have written my book. It will be read; whether\r\nin the present age or by posterity matters little. It can wait for its\r\nreaders. Has not God waited six thousand years for one to contemplate\r\nhis works?\" In a last fruitless attempt to recover twenty-nine thousand\r\nflorins, owed him by the government, worn out with want and\r\ndisappointment, he fell ill and died at Ratisbon, leaving thirty-three\r\nworks, twenty-two volumes in manuscript, and his family in the direst\r\npoverty. Such was the man who admired Galileo in his youth, and who\r\nstands with him in the admiration of the generations that have come and\r\ngone since these two men lived and wrote and suffered.\r\n\r\nAt Padua, Galileo soon attracted great numbers to his class-room. Often\r\na thousand gathered to hear his lectures, and when the hall was too\r\ncramped, he spoke to the people in the open air. He was above the middle\r\nheight, well proportioned, with cheerful countenance, witty in\r\nconversation, and enthusiastic in his manner. So learned that he could\r\nrepeat by heart much of the works of Virgil, Ovid, Horace, and Seneca;\r\nhe was yet modest and unassuming, saying that he never met a man so\r\nignorant but that something might be learned from him.\r\n\r\nHe labored incessantly. He wrote treatises on Fortifications, on\r\nMechanics, on Gnomonics, on the laws of motion, on the celestial globe,\r\nwhich were copied by his pupils, and sent by them far and wide over\r\nEurope. He took a workman into his family, and began to superintend the\r\nmaking of the compass which he had invented, and the thermoscope, or\r\nheat indicator, which led in later years to the thermometer. His\r\nexperiment was made by a \"glass bottle about the size of a hen's egg,\r\nthe neck of which was two palms long, and as narrow as a straw. Having\r\nwell heated the bulb in his hands, he placed its mouth in a vessel\r\ncontaining a little water, and withdrawing the heat of his hand from the\r\nbulb, instantly the water rose in the neck, more than a palm above the\r\nlevel of the water in the vessel.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the first six years at Padua, his salary rose from about one\r\nhundred dollars to five hundred dollars, yearly. All this time, when his\r\nmind should have been free from care for his great work, he was beset\r\nwith difficulties. His sister, Virginia, had married before his father's\r\ndeath, but a promised dowry had never been paid, and now the\r\nbrother-in-law demanded the payment. The mother, worried over the\r\nprospect, wrote to her son, Galileo, \"If you carry into effect your\r\nintention of coming here next month, I shall be rejoiced, only you must\r\nnot come unprovided with funds, for I see that Benedetto is determined\r\nto have his own, that is to say, what you promised him; and he threatens\r\nloudly that he will have you arrested the instant you arrive here. And\r\nas I hear you bound yourself to pay, he would have the power to arrest\r\nyou, and he is just the man to do it. So I warn you, for it would grieve\r\nme much if anything of the kind were to happen.\"\r\n\r\nLivia, another sister, had become engaged to a Pisan gentleman, with the\r\npromise of a dowry of eighteen hundred ducats, eight hundred of which\r\nmust be paid down. The \"Pisan gentleman\" could not burden himself with a\r\nwife, without funds to help support her and himself. So Galileo\r\ngenerously, if not wisely, borrowed six hundred ducats, and paid the\r\nnecessary eight hundred, giving his sister beautiful clothes and house\r\nfurnishings.\r\n\r\nBesides these sisters, Galileo had a lazy brother to provide for,\r\nMichelangelo, a young man of some musical talent and elegant manners,\r\nwith the not unusual gift of being able to spend much and earn little.\r\nGalileo obtained a situation for him with a Polish prince, and spent two\r\nhundred crowns in getting him ready for the new position. He went\r\nthither, but soon returned, and another place had to be procured for\r\nhim, at the court of the Duke of Bavaria.\r\n\r\nWhile there, instead of helping to pay his sister's dowry, as he had\r\npromised, he married; had an extravagant wedding feast, and then wrote\r\nhis hard-working brother: \"I know that you will say that I should have\r\nwaited, and thought of our sisters before taking a wife. But, good\r\nheavens! the idea of toiling all one's life just to put by a few\r\nfarthings to give one's sisters! This yoke would be indeed too heavy and\r\nbitter; for I am more than certain that in thirty years I should not\r\nhave saved enough to cover this debt.\"\r\n\r\nWith all the pressure upon him for money, Galileo kept steadily on in\r\nhis absorbing studies. In the year 1609, he constructed a telescope. It\r\nis true that Hans Lipperhey, of Germany, had invented a spy-glass, and\r\npresented it to Prince Maurice, so that the principle was understood;\r\nbut nobody gave it practical illustration till Galileo, having heard of\r\nthe glass, began to reflect how an instrument could be made to bring\r\ndistant objects near. In a leaden tube, he fixed two glasses, both\r\nhaving one side flat, and the other side of the one concave, and the\r\nother convex. By this, objects appeared three times nearer and nine\r\ntimes larger. A few days later, he hastened with his leaden tube to\r\nVenice, to exhibit it to the Doge and the Senate. He wrote to a\r\nfriend:--\r\n\r\n\"Many gentlemen and senators, even the oldest, have ascended at various\r\ntimes the highest bell-towers in Venice, to spy out ships at sea, making\r\nsail for the mouth of the harbor, and have seen them clearly, though\r\nwithout my telescope they would have been invisible for more than two\r\nhours. The effect of this instrument is to show an object at a distance\r\nof, say, fifty miles, as if it were but five miles off.\r\n\r\n\"Perceiving of what great utility such an instrument would prove in\r\nnaval and military operations, and seeing that His Serenity greatly\r\ndesired to possess it, I resolved four days ago to go to the palace and\r\npresent it to the Doge as a free gift. And on quitting the\r\npresence-chamber, I was commanded to bide awhile in the hall of the\r\nsenate, whereunto, after a little, the Illustrissimo Prioli, who is\r\nProcurator and one of the Riformatori of the University, came forth to\r\nme from the presence-chamber, and, taking me by the hand, said, 'that\r\nthe senate, knowing the manner in which I had served it for seventeen\r\nyears at Padua, and being sensible of my courtesy in making it a present\r\nof my telescope, had immediately ordered the Illustrious Riformatori to\r\nelect me (with my good-will) to the professorship for life, with a\r\nstipend of one thousand florins yearly.'\"\r\n\r\nThis must have been a comfort to the now famous Galileo, as it was,\r\ndoubtless, to the useless Michelangelo, and the two brothers-in-law! He\r\ncould now live in comparative peace and rest.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Padua, he began eagerly to study the heavens. He found\r\nthat the surface of the moon was mountainous; that the Milky Way was\r\ncomposed of an immense number of small stars and nebulous matter; that\r\nOrion, instead of being made up of seven heavenly bodies, had over five\r\nhundred stars; and that the Pleiades were not seven, but thirty-six. In\r\nJanuary, 1610, he discovered the four moons of Jupiter, and that they\r\nrevolved around him. July 25 of the same year, he discovered the ring of\r\nSaturn; in October, the phases of Venus, and later, the solar spots.\r\n\r\nFlorence and Padua were in a blaze of excitement. These new discoveries\r\nseemed to prove that the earth was not the centre of the universe, but\r\nthat Copernicus was right when he declared the sun to be the centre.\r\nGreat opposition began to develop itself. Some of the Aristotelians\r\ndeclared that the telescope of Galileo showed things which do not exist.\r\n\"It was ridiculous,\" they said, \"that four planets (Jupiter's moons)\r\nwere chasing each other around a large planet.\r\n\r\n\"It is angels who make Saturn, Jupiter, the sun, etc., turn round. If\r\nthe earth revolves, it must also have an angel in the centre to set it\r\nin motion; but if only devils live there, it would, therefore, be a\r\ndevil who would impart motion to the earth.\r\n\r\n\"The planets, the sun, the fixed stars, all belong to one species;\r\nnamely, that of stars--they, therefore, all move, or all stand still.\r\n\r\n\"It seems, therefore, to be a grievous wrong to place the earth, which\r\nis a sink of impurity, among the heavenly bodies, which are pure and\r\ndivine things.\"\r\n\r\nLibri, one of the Pisan professors, spoke of the new discoveries as\r\n\"celestial trifles.\" When he died, Galileo naively remarked, \"Libri did\r\nnot choose to see my celestial trifles while he was on earth; perhaps he\r\nwill, now he is gone to heaven.\"\r\n\r\nGalileo now longed for freedom from teaching, that he might have his\r\ntime for study and writing. He had planned, he said, \"two books on the\r\nsystem of the universe; an immense work (idea, _concetto_), full of\r\nphilosophy, astronomy, and geometry: three books on local motion, a\r\nscience entirely new; no one, either ancient or modern, having\r\ndiscovered any of the marvellous accidents which I demonstrate in\r\nnatural and violent motions; so that I may, with very great reason, call\r\nit a new science, discovered by me from its very first principles: three\r\nbooks on mechanics, two on the demonstration of its first principles,\r\nand one of problems; and though this is a subject which has already been\r\ntreated by various writers, yet all which has been written hitherto\r\nneither in quantity nor otherwise is the quarter of what I am writing\r\non it. I have also various treatises on natural subjects, on sound and\r\nspeech, on sight and colors, on the tide, on the composition of\r\ncontinuous quantity, on the motion of animals, and others; besides, I\r\nhave also an idea of writing some books on the military art, giving not\r\nonly a model of a soldier, but teaching, with very exact rules, all\r\nwhich it is his duty to know that depends on mathematics; as, for\r\ninstance, the knowledge of encampment, drawing up battalions,\r\nfortifications, assaults, planning, surveying, the knowledge of\r\nartillery, the use of various instruments, etc.\"\r\n\r\nWith all this work in mind, he resigned the professorship at Padua, and\r\nremoved to Florence, the Grand Duke Cosmo II. giving him a yearly salary\r\nof about one thousand dollars, and the title of Philosopher to His\r\nHighness.\r\n\r\nHis first thought, as ever, was for his family. He asked an advance of\r\ntwo years' salary, and paid the dowry debts of his sisters' grasping\r\nhusbands.\r\n\r\nIn 1611, his expenses paid by the Grand Duke, he went to Rome to show\r\nhis \"celestial novelties,\" as they were called, to the pope and the\r\ncardinals. He was received with great attention, and all seemed\r\ndelighted to look upon the wonders of the heavens, provided always that\r\nnothing could be proved against the supposed assertion of the Bible that\r\nthe earth did not move!\r\n\r\nGalileo soon published his \"Discourse on Floating Bodies,\" which\r\naroused violent opposition; \"Spots observed on the Body of the Sun,\" and\r\nthe \"Discourse on the Tides.\"\r\n\r\nFour years later, he was again in Rome to plead for the Copernican\r\nsystem, and to defend his own conduct in advocating a thing in\r\nopposition to the Catholic church. He said: \"I am inclined to think that\r\nthe authority of Holy Scripture is intended to convince men of those\r\ntruths which are necessary for their salvation, and which, being far\r\nabove man's understanding, cannot be made credible by any learning, or\r\nany other means than revelation by the Holy Spirit. But that the same\r\nGod, who has endowed us with senses, reason, and understanding, does not\r\npermit us to use them, and desires to acquaint us in any other way with\r\nsuch knowledge as we are in a position to acquire for ourselves by means\r\nof those faculties, _that_, it seems to me, I am not bound to believe,\r\nespecially concerning those sciences about which the Holy Scriptures\r\ncontain only small fragments and varying conclusions; and this is\r\nprecisely the case with astronomy, of which there is so little that the\r\nplanets are not even all enumerated.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of Galileo's logic, the church decreed that all books\r\nwhich stated the Copernican system as true should be prohibited; as a\r\nmathematical hypothesis, it might be speculated upon. This was a great\r\ndisappointment to Galileo, who loved and revered the Roman Catholic\r\nfaith. He went home to the Villa Segni, at Bellosguardo, near Florence,\r\nand for seven years led a studious and secluded life.\r\n\r\nHis greatest comfort, during these quiet years, was the devotion of his\r\ndaughter, Polissena, who had entered a convent as Sister Maria Celeste.\r\nWhile in Padua, Galileo had three children by Marina Gamba, a Venetian\r\nwoman of inferior station. She afterwards married a man of her own\r\nclass, and Galileo took his children to his own home; a condition of\r\nthings possible with the low moral standard of the time. The two\r\ndaughters were placed in a convent, while the son, Vincenzo, was\r\neducated for the profession of medicine, but he seems to have been a\r\ndisappointment and a source of discomfort.\r\n\r\nMaria Celeste, in the convent of St. Matthew, loving and tender, and\r\nhelpful to all around her, wrote constantly to the man whom she\r\nidolized. \"I put by carefully,\" she says, \"the letters you write me\r\ndaily, and when not engaged with my duties, I read them over and over\r\nagain. This is the greatest pleasure I have, and you may think how glad\r\nI am to read the letters you receive from persons who, besides being\r\nexcellent in themselves, have you in esteem.\"\r\n\r\nAgain she writes, \"I leave you to imagine how pleased I am to read the\r\nletters you constantly send me. Only to see how your love for me prompts\r\nyou to let me know fully what favors you receive from these gentlemen is\r\nenough to fill me with joy. Nevertheless I feel it a little hard to hear\r\nthat you intend leaving home so soon, because I shall have to do\r\nwithout you, and for a long time too, if I am not mistaken. And your\r\nlordship may believe that I am speaking the truth when I say that except\r\nyou there is not a creature who gives me any comfort. But I will not\r\ngrieve at your departure because of this, for that would be to complain\r\nwhen you had cause for rejoicing. Therefore I too will rejoice, and\r\ncontinue to pray God to give you grace and health to make a prosperous\r\njourney, so that you may return satisfied, and live long and happily,\r\nall which, I trust, will come to pass by God's help.\r\n\r\n\"I send two baked pears for these days of vigil. But as the greatest\r\ntreat of all, I send you a rose, which ought to please you extremely,\r\nseeing what a rarity it is at this season. And with the rose, you must\r\naccept its thorns, which represent the bitter passion of our Lord, while\r\nthe green leaves represent the hope we may entertain that through the\r\nsame Sacred Passion we, having passed through the darkness of this short\r\nwinter of our mortal life, may attain to the brightness and felicity of\r\nan eternal spring in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only in one respect does cloister life weigh heavily on me; that is,\r\nthat it prevents my attending on you personally, which would be my\r\ndesire, were it permitted. My thoughts are always with you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the seven years of study went by, with the sweet love of Maria\r\nCeleste to brighten them. There are none so great that they can live\r\nwithout affection.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the seven years, Urban VIII. came to the pontifical\r\nthrone, and Galileo and other scientists rejoiced, for he had seemed\r\nliberal in thought and generous in heart. When he was cardinal, he had\r\nsent a letter to Galileo, saying, \"The esteem which I always entertain\r\nfor yourself and your great merits has given occasion to the enclosed\r\nverses. If not worthy of you, they will serve at any rate as a proof of\r\nmy affection, while I purpose to add lustre to my poetry by your\r\nrenowned name. Without wasting words, then, in further apologies, which\r\nI leave to the confidence which I place in you, I beg you to receive\r\nwith favor this insignificant proof of my great affection.\"\r\n\r\nAt Easter, 1624, Galileo, now sixty years old, resolved to proceed to\r\nRome, to welcome the new pope, and urge his approval of the Copernican\r\ntheory. Frail in health, he was carried most of the way in a litter.\r\nDuring a visit of six weeks, he had six long audiences with Urban VIII.;\r\nbut, though he was affably received, the pope was in no wise convinced,\r\nbut rather tried to convince Galileo that he was in error.\r\n\r\nYet so kind was he that Galileo went back to Florence with the hope and\r\nbelief that he could bring out his great work, \"Dialogues on the Two\r\nPrincipal Systems of the World, the Ptolemaic and Copernican,\" without\r\nopposition from the church. In this book, Galileo gave the results of\r\nscientific research and discovery in the half century preceding, using\r\nsuch clear yet brilliant style in writing as to make the work attractive\r\neven to the unlearned.\r\n\r\nIt was ready for publication in March, 1630, but to be sure that the\r\npope did not object, Galileo was urged to go in person to Rome. He went\r\nand presented the matter to Urban, who gave his consent provided that\r\nthe title should show that the Copernican system was treated as a\r\nhypothesis merely, and that he, the pope, should write the closing\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nRather than forego the publication of that upon which he had worked for\r\nyears, Galileo consented, and returned to Florence. A license to publish\r\nwas then obtained from the Inquisitor-General, and the Vicar-General of\r\nFlorence, after great delay. A second and a third time the papal\r\nauthorities wished to look over the manuscript. Two years went slowly\r\nby.\r\n\r\nOther anxieties came to the man of sixty-eight, besides the long delay.\r\nThe impecunious Michelangelo sent his wife, seven children, and a German\r\nnurse, to the home of Galileo, to be taken care of. The eldest nephew\r\nwas sent to Rome to study music. He was found to be obstinate, impudent,\r\nand dissolute, \"wicked ways\" which his weak and indulgent father said\r\n\"he did not learn from me, or any one else belonging to him. It must\r\nhave been the fault of his wet nurse!\"\r\n\r\nGalileo's son Vincenzo had married and brought his wife home to live.\r\nStrange fortune for this man of genius! Strange that he must have\r\nhelpless relatives, and constant pecuniary troubles. Most great lives\r\nare as pathetic as they are great.\r\n\r\nAs ever, the one gleam of light was the daily letter from Maria Celeste,\r\nin which she expressed a tenderness beyond what any daughter ever had\r\nfor a father. \"But I do not know how to express myself, except by saying\r\nthat I love you better than myself. For, after God, I belong to you; and\r\nyour kindnesses are so numberless that I feel I could put my life in\r\nperil, were it to save you from any trouble, excepting only that I would\r\nnot offend His Divine Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nFinally Galileo moved to Arcetri, over against the convent, to be near\r\nthe one who alone satisfied his heart.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1632, the \"Dialogues\" appeared. Copies were sent to his\r\nfriends and disciples throughout Italy. The whole country applauded, and\r\nat last Galileo seemed to have won the homage he had so long deserved.\r\n\r\nBut a storm was gathering. Enemies were at work prejudicing the mind of\r\nUrban VIII., making him feel that Galileo had wrought evil to the\r\nchurch. At once an order came from the Inquisition to secure every copy\r\nin the booksellers' shops throughout Italy, and to forward all copies to\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nIn October of the same year of publication, Galileo was summoned to\r\nappear at Rome, to answer to that terror of past centuries, the charge\r\nof heresy. His friends urged that he was old and feeble, and that he\r\nwould die on the journey, but Urban's commands were peremptory.\r\n\r\nGalileo was deeply depressed by the summons, and wrote a friend: \"This\r\nvexes me so much that it makes me curse the time devoted to these\r\nstudies, in which I strove and hoped to deviate somewhat from the beaten\r\ntrack generally pursued by learned men. I not only repent having given\r\nthe world a portion of my writings, but feel inclined to suppress those\r\nstill in hand, and to give them to the flames, and thus satisfy the\r\nlonging desire of my enemies, to whom my ideas are so inconvenient.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 20, 1633, the decrepit old man set out in a litter for Rome,\r\narriving on February 13. On April 12, he was brought before the\r\nInquisition, and briefly examined and then remanded to prison, though\r\ntreated with great leniency. The anxiety and deprivation from outdoor\r\nexercise brought on illness, and he was confined to his bed till led a\r\nsecond time before the Inquisition, April 30.\r\n\r\nWeak, aged, in fear of torture, he made the melancholy confession that\r\nhis \"error had been one of vainglorious ambition, and pure ignorance and\r\ninadvertence.\" Pure ignorance! from the man who had studied for fifty\r\nyears all that the world knew of science! But he recalled how men had\r\ndied at the stake for offending the church. The world is not full of\r\nmen and women who can suffer death for their convictions, however much\r\nwe may admire such courage. On May 10, he was summoned a third time\r\nbefore the Inquisition, and told that he had eight days in which to\r\nwrite his defence. In touching language he stated how the book had been\r\nexamined and re examined by the authorities, so that there might be\r\nnothing heterodox in it; and then he urged them to consider his age and\r\nfeeble health.\r\n\r\nA fourth time he came before the Holy Congregation, June 21, and was\r\nasked whether he held that the sun is the centre of the solar system,\r\nand that the earth is not the centre, and that it moves. He replied, \"I\r\ndo not hold, and have not held this opinion of Copernicus since the\r\ncommand was intimated to me that I must abandon it; for the rest, I am\r\nhere in your hands,--do with me what you please.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then June 22, in the forenoon, in the large hall of the Dominican\r\nConvent of St. Maria sopra la Minerva, in the presence of cardinals and\r\nprelates, he heard his sentence.\r\n\r\n\"The proposition that the sun is the centre of the world and does not\r\nmove from its place is absurd, and false philosophically, and formally\r\nheretical, because it is expressly contrary to the Holy Scripture.\r\n\r\n\"The proposition that the earth is not the centre of the world and\r\nimmovable, but that it moves, and also with a diurnal motion, is equally\r\nabsurd and false philosophically; and theologically considered, at\r\nleast, erroneous in faith.... Invoking, therefore, the most holy name of\r\nour Lord Jesus Christ and of His most glorious mother and ever Virgin\r\nMary ... we say, pronounce, sentence, declare, that you, the said\r\nGalileo, by reason of the matters adduced in process, and by you\r\nconfessed as above, have rendered yourself, in the judgment of this Holy\r\nOffice, vehemently suspected of heresy,--namely, of having believed and\r\nheld the doctrine, which is false and contrary to the sacred and divine\r\nScriptures,--that the sun is the centre of the world and does not move\r\nfrom east to west, and that the earth moves and is not the centre of the\r\nworld.... We condemn you to the formal prison of this Holy Office during\r\nour pleasure, and, by way of salutary penance, we enjoin that for three\r\nyears to come you repeat once a week the seven Penitential Psalms.\"\r\n\r\nGalileo was also required to \"abjure, curse, and detest the aforesaid\r\nerrors and heresies.\" And then the white-haired man of seventy, humbly\r\nkneeling before the whole assembly, made the pitiful abjuration of his\r\nbelief. \"I abjure with a sincere heart and unfeigned faith, I curse and\r\ndetest the said errors and heresies, and, generally, all and every error\r\nand sect contrary to the Holy Catholic Church.\"\r\n\r\nPitiful spectacle of intolerance! If we of this nineteenth century have\r\nlearned to tolerate and treat with respect the beliefs of others though\r\nwidely divergent from our own, perhaps this wretched drama was not acted\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Galileo exclaimed as he rose from his feet, \"_E\r\npur si muove_,\" \"It moves, for all that,\" but this would have been well\r\nnigh an impossibility, in the midst of men who would instantly have\r\ntaken him to a dungeon, and the story is no longer believed.\r\n\r\nOn July 9, poor Galileo was allowed to leave Rome for Siena, where he\r\nstayed five months in the house of the archbishop, and then became a\r\nprisoner in his own house at Arcetri, with strict injunctions that he\r\nwas \"not to entertain friends, nor to allow the assemblage of many at a\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote sadly to Maria Celeste, \"My name is erased from the book of the\r\nliving.\" Tender words came back, saying that it seemed \"a thousand\r\nyears\" since she had seen him, and that she would recite the seven\r\npenitential psalms for him, \"to save you the trouble of remembering it.\"\r\n\r\nIn less than a year, sweet Maria Celeste had said the last psalms for\r\nhim. She died April 1, 1634, at thirty-three years of age, leaving\r\nGalileo heart-broken; \"a woman,\" he said, \"of exquisite mind, singular\r\ngoodness, and most tenderly attached to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to work on another book, but he said, pathetically, \"I hear her\r\nconstantly calling me!\" Beautiful spirit, that will forever shed a halo\r\naround the name of Galileo Galilei!\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1636, he completed his \"Dialogues on Motion,\" and sent\r\nit to Leyden for publication. The next year he made his last discovery,\r\nknown as the moon's librations.\r\n\r\nThe house at Arcetri had become dark and lonely. The wife of\r\nMichelangelo, her three daughters and a son, had all died of the plague.\r\nIt was doubly dark, for Galileo had become hopelessly blind, \"so that\r\nthis heaven, this earth, this universe, which I by my marvellous\r\ndiscoveries and clear demonstrations had enlarged a hundred thousand\r\ntimes beyond the belief of the wise men of bygone ages, henceforward for\r\nme is shrunk into such a small space as is filled by my own bodily\r\nsensations.\"\r\n\r\nHis last work was a short treatise on the secondary light of the moon.\r\n\"I am obliged now,\" he said, sadly, \"to have recourse to other hands and\r\nother pens than mine since my sad loss of sight. This, of course,\r\noccasions great loss of time, particularly now that my memory is\r\nimpaired by advanced age; so that in placing my thoughts on paper, many\r\nand many a time I am forced to have the foregoing sentences read to me\r\nbefore I can tell what ought to follow; else I should repeat the same\r\nthing over and over.\"\r\n\r\nHe had planned other work, but death came on the evening of January 8,\r\n1642, eight years after Celeste left him. His beloved pupils, Torricelli\r\nand Viviani, and his son Vincenzo, stood by his bedside.\r\n\r\nHe desired to be buried in the family vault of the Galilei in Santa\r\nCroce, at Florence, and the city at once voted a public funeral and\r\nthree thousand crowns for a marble mausoleum. But the church at Rome\r\nprevented, lest the pernicious doctrine that the earth moves, should\r\nthereby have confirmation. He was therefore buried in an obscure corner\r\nof Del Noviziato, a side chapel of Santa Croce.\r\n\r\nA century later, March 12, 1737, in the presence of the learned men of\r\nItaly, with great ceremony, the bones of Galileo were removed to a new\r\nresting-place in Santa Croce, and buried with his beloved friend,\r\nViviani. An imposing monument was erected over him. The truth finally\r\ntriumphed, as it always does. The works of Galileo, in sixteen volumes,\r\nare no longer prohibited, as they were in his lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ISAAC NEWTON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR ISAAC NEWTON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1642, in which Galileo, sad and blind, went away from\r\nthe earth, Sir Isaac Newton came to make his home upon it.\r\n\r\nHe was born December 25, the only child of Isaac Newton and Hannah\r\nAyscough. The father died at thirty-seven, a few months after his\r\nmarriage, and the young wife, after the birth of her child, was both\r\nfather and mother to the helpless infant. He was so frail that there\r\nseemed little probability that he could live to manhood, or even\r\nboyhood. Naturally, between mother and son there grew a most ardent\r\naffection, which neither time nor death could change.\r\n\r\nThe manor-house of Woolsthorpe in Colsterworth, Lincoln county, was a\r\ntwo-story stone building, owned for a century by the Newton family, and\r\nbringing a limited income from the little farm in connection with it.\r\nHere Isaac passed his childhood, going to the schools near by, and\r\nlearning to read, write, and cipher.\r\n\r\nAt twelve, he was sent to the public school at Grantham, where he showed\r\nlittle taste for study, and managed easily to stand at the foot of his\r\nclass. When he was the last in the lowermost form but one, the boy next\r\nabove him, as they were going to school, gave Isaac a kick, which\r\noccasioned severe pain. Stirred with wrath, Isaac challenged the other\r\nboy to a fight. For this purpose, they repaired to a neighboring\r\nchurchyard, where young Newton, though much the smaller and weaker of\r\nthe two, pounded his antagonist till he was glad to come to any terms of\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\nHe resolved now that this boy should no longer stand above him in\r\nscholarship, and with a new ambition and energy born of his insult, he\r\nsoon rose to the highest place in the school. It was not idleness,\r\nprobably, that made Newton a poor scholar, but his mind was absorbed\r\nwith making saws, hammers, hatchets, and other tools.\r\n\r\nHe made a windmill and placed it on the top of his home, the wind\r\nputting it in motion. When there was no wind, a novel expedient was\r\nresorted to. A mouse, which was called \"the miller,\" was trained to turn\r\nthe windmill by walking on a tread wheel, with some corn just beyond his\r\nreach! All through life, he was exceedingly kind to animals, and could\r\nnever tolerate shooting or hunting for sport. He objected to one of his\r\nnephews, when praised in his presence, \"that he loved killing of birds,\"\r\nand this was sufficient to win his disesteem. It is probable, therefore,\r\nthat the little mouse was kindly cared for by the young experimenter.\r\n\r\nHe also made a water clock, about four feet high, with a dial-plate at\r\nthe top, with figures of the hours. The index was turned by a piece of\r\nwood, which either fell or rose by water dropping. Every morning the lad\r\nsupplied his clock with the proper amount of water.\r\n\r\nBesides these, he invented a four-wheeled carriage, which was moved with\r\na handle by the person who sat in it. For his boy friends, he made\r\nlanterns of \"crimpled paper\" with a candle inside, to light them to\r\nschool in the dark winter mornings, and paper kites of the best form and\r\nproportion. In dark nights he tied the lanterns to the tails of his\r\nkites, and ignorant people sometimes mistook them for comets!\r\n\r\nOn the manor-house at Woolsthorpe he carved sun-dials, which were\r\nvisible a century later. He was a \"sober, silent, and thinking lad,\" who\r\nwas always hammering in his room, or making drawings with his pen and\r\npencil, designing with charcoal on his walls, birds, animals, ships, and\r\nmathematical diagrams.\r\n\r\nMrs. Newton, the mother, had married again, after a singular courtship.\r\n\"Mr. Smith, a neighboring clergyman, who had a very good estate, had\r\nlived a bachelor till he was pretty old, and, one of his parishioners\r\nadvising him to marry, he said he did not know where to meet with a good\r\nwife. The man answered, 'The widow Newton is an extraordinary good\r\nwoman.' 'But,' said Mr. Smith, 'how do I know she will have me, and I\r\ndon't care to ask and be denied; but if you will go and ask her, I will\r\npay you for your day's work.'\r\n\r\n\"He went accordingly. Her answer was, she would be advised by her\r\nbrother Ayscough, upon which Mr. Smith sent the same person to Mr.\r\nAyscough on the same errand, who, upon consulting with his sister,\r\ntreated with Mr. Smith, who gave her son Isaac a parcel of land, one of\r\nthe terms insisted upon by the widow if she married him.\"\r\n\r\nThough for a time she was thus removed from Isaac, leaving him with his\r\ngrandmother, on the death of Rev. Mr. Smith, she returned to the\r\nmanor-house.\r\n\r\nWhen Isaac had reached his fifteenth year, his mother, not seeming to\r\nthink of any profession for her mechanical son, decided to make of him a\r\nfarmer and grazier. On Saturdays, the market day at Grantham, she would\r\nsend him with grain and other agricultural produce, in the care of an\r\nold and trusty servant. The boy had no taste for selling produce, and\r\nwould hasten to the attic in the house of Mr. Clark, an apothecary, with\r\nwhom he had boarded while at school, and there spend his hours in\r\nreading old books, till the time came for him to go home, the servant\r\nmeantime having sold the vegetables.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, the lad would not go as far as Grantham, but,\r\nseating himself beside a hedge along the road, would read some favorite\r\nauthor till the servant returned. When his mother sent him to watch the\r\ncattle, they enjoyed a neighbor's corn-field, while he enjoyed a book or\r\nwhittled out water-wheels. It did not seem intentional disobedience\r\ntoward a mother of whom he was very fond, but complete absorption in\r\nsome other pursuit.\r\n\r\nWhen he was sixteen he was greatly interested in finding the proper form\r\nof a body which would offer the least resistance when moving in a fluid.\r\nIn a severe storm, to test the force of the gale, he jumped first in the\r\ndirection in which the wind blew, and then in opposition to the wind,\r\nand after measuring the length of the leap in both directions, and\r\ncomparing it with the length to which he could jump in a perfectly calm\r\nday, he was enabled to compute the force of the storm.\r\n\r\nHis mother soon found that her boy would not make a successful farmer,\r\nand sent him back to school at Grantham, to prepare for Trinity College,\r\nCambridge, which he entered when he was nineteen.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the time spent at Grantham was a happy time; for\r\nyoung Newton there met and, it is said, loved Miss Storey, sister of Dr.\r\nStorey, a physician near Colsterworth, and daughter of the apothecary's\r\nsecond wife. She was two or three years younger than Newton, a girl of\r\nattractive face and unusual talents. As his income as a Fellow was\r\nsmall, after leaving college, they did not marry, though his interest in\r\nher continued unabated through life. Though she was twice married, he\r\nnever paid a visit to Woolsthorpe without going to see her, and\r\nliberally relieved her from little pecuniary embarrassments, when his\r\nown circumstances had become easy. How the world loves constancy; an\r\naffection which knows no change! That he would have been happier in\r\nthose quiet years of study, even in his poverty, had he married, is\r\nprobable; but that the world gained by his undivided devotion to\r\nscience, is equally probable.\r\n\r\nOn July 8, 1661, Newton entered college, and soon, through the study of\r\nDescartes' Geometry, showed his skill in higher mathematics. And now\r\nbegan an almost unexampled development of mind.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-two, he was studying a comet so closely, and the circles and\r\nhalo round the moon, that he impaired his health by sitting up late at\r\nnight. In 1665, May 20, when he was twenty-three, he committed to\r\nwriting his first discovery of fluxions--\"the infinitely small increase\r\nor decrease of a variable or flowing quantity in a certain infinitely\r\nsmall and constant period of time.\"\r\n\r\nThe same year, when the college had been dismissed on account of the\r\nplague in Cambridge, Newton made his immortal discovery of the\r\nAttraction of Gravitation. While sitting alone in his garden at\r\nWoolsthorpe, and observing an apple fall to the ground, it occurred to\r\nhim that as the same power by which the apple fell was not sensibly\r\ndiminished at the summits of the loftiest spires, nor on the tops of\r\nthe highest mountains, it might extend to the moon, about which he had\r\nbeen studying, and retain her in her orbit. If to the moon, why not to\r\nthe planets?\r\n\r\nThe tree from which the apple fell was so much decayed in 1820, that it\r\nwas cut down, but the wood was carefully preserved by Mr. Turnor of\r\nStoke Rocheford.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the following year, 1666, when Newton was\r\ntwenty-four, he purchased a prism, in order to make some experiments on\r\nDescartes' theory of colors. He made a hole in his window shutter,\r\ndarkened the room, and admitted a ray of the sunlight. On the opposite\r\nwall he saw the solar or prismatic spectrum, an elongated image of the\r\nsun, about five times as long as it was broad, and consisting of _seven_\r\ndifferent colors; red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\r\nWhite light was thus discovered to be of a compound nature; a mixture of\r\nall the colors. He said, \"Whiteness is the usual color of light; for\r\nlight is a confused aggregate of rays endued with all sorts of colors,\r\nas they are promiscuously darted from the various parts of luminous\r\nbodies.\" If any one color predominates, the light will incline to that\r\ncolor, as the yellow flame of a candle. Heretofore, there had been all\r\nsorts of conjectures about the nature and origin of colors. Descartes\r\nbelieved them to be a modification of light, depending on the direct or\r\nrotary motion of its particles. But Newton showed by many experiments\r\nthat color is a property of light, or innate in light itself. We speak\r\nof a thing as red because it reflects red, and absorbs all the other\r\ncolors. The green leaf stops or absorbs the red, blue, and violet rays\r\nof the white light, and reflects and transmits only those which compose\r\nits green.\r\n\r\nHe also found that the red rays are refracted or turned out of their\r\ncourse least of all the colors, and violet most, thereby discovering the\r\ndifferent refrangibility of the rays of light; \"a discovery which has\r\nhad the most extensive applications to every branch of science, and,\r\nwhat is very rare in the history of inventions, one to which no other\r\nperson has made the slightest claim.\"\r\n\r\nHis beautiful experiments with rings resulted in his Scale of Colors, of\r\ngreat value in optical research.\r\n\r\nIn 1668, when Newton was twenty-six, he constructed a small reflecting\r\ntelescope, and soon a larger one, which he sent to the Royal Society;\r\nand was made a member of that body, in 1671. Two years previously he had\r\nbeen appointed to the Lucasian professorship of mathematics at\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nHe was now, at twenty-seven, spoken of as a man of \"unparalleled\r\ngenius.\" He had discovered the compound nature of white light, the\r\nattraction of gravity, fluxions, and made the first reflecting telescope\r\never directed toward the heavens, though one had been invented\r\npreviously, by James Gregory, of Aberdeen. The boy who had thought of a\r\nmouse to turn his windmill had thought out some of the sublimest things\r\nin nature, and was henceforward to rank as one of the few masterminds of\r\nscience. Newton's doctrine of colors met with the most bitter\r\nopposition. At last, he became so tired of the controversy, that he\r\nwrote Leibnitz, \"I was so persecuted with discussions arising out of my\r\ntheory of light, that I blamed my own imprudence for parting with so\r\nsubstantial a blessing as my quiet to run after a shadow.\" To another he\r\nwrote, \"I see I have made myself a slave to philosophy; but if I get\r\nfree of Mr. Linus's business, I will resolutely bid adieu to it\r\neternally, excepting what I do for my private satisfaction, or leave to\r\ncome out after me; for I see a man must either resolve to put out\r\nnothing new, or to become a slave to defend it.\"\r\n\r\nNewton was also troubled pecuniarily at this time, and asked to be\r\nexcused from the weekly payments to the Royal Society, thereby resigning\r\nhis membership. He even meditated the study of law, as his income was so\r\nlimited. Strange that so many of the great things of this life are\r\nwrought out by those who are in sorrow or privation.\r\n\r\nBut amid all the opposition to his discoveries and his poverty, the\r\nunparalleled devotion to study was continued. When he was weary of other\r\nbranches, he said \"he refreshed himself with history and chronology.\"\r\nYears afterward he published the \"Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms\r\namended, to which is prefixed a short chronicle, from the first memory\r\nof things in Europe, to the Conquest of Persia, by Alexander the\r\nGreat.\" Says a gentleman who was with him for years, \"I never knew him\r\nto take any recreation or pastime, either in riding out to take the air,\r\nwalking, boating, or any other exercise whatever, thinking all hours\r\nlost that were not spent in his studies, to which he kept so close that\r\nhe seldom left his chamber except at term time, when he read in the\r\nschools, as being Lucasianus Professor, where so few went to hear him,\r\nand fewer that understood him, that oftentimes he did in a manner, for\r\nwant of hearers, read to the walls....\r\n\r\n\"So intent, so serious upon his studies that he ate very sparingly, nay,\r\nofttimes he has forgot to eat at all, so that, going into his chamber, I\r\nhave found his mess untouched, of which when I have reminded him he\r\nwould reply, 'Have I?' and then making to the table, would eat a bit or\r\ntwo standing, for I cannot say I ever saw him sit at table by himself.\r\nAt some seldom entertainments the masters of colleges were chiefly his\r\nguests.\r\n\r\n\"He very rarely went to bed till two or three of the clock, sometimes\r\nnot till five or six, lying about four or five hours, especially at\r\nspring and fall of the leaf, at which times he used to employ about six\r\nweeks in his elaboratory, the fire scarcely going out either night or\r\nday, he sitting up one night, and I another, till he had finished his\r\nchemical experiments, in the performances of which he was the most\r\naccurate, strict, exact....\"\r\n\r\nWhen his most intense studies were carried on, \"he learned to go to bed\r\nat twelve, finding by experience that if he exceeded that hour but a\r\nlittle, it did him more harm in his health than a whole day's study.\"\r\n\r\n\"He very rarely went to dine in the hall, except on some public days,\r\nand then if he has not been minded, would go very carelessly, with shoes\r\ndown at heels, stockings untied, surplice on, and his head scarcely\r\ncombed.... At some seldom times when he designed to dine in the hall, he\r\nwould turn to the left hand and go out into the street, when making a\r\nstop when he found his mistake, would hastily turn back, and then\r\nsometimes, instead of going into the hall, would return to his chamber\r\nagain.... In his chamber he walked so very much that you might have\r\nthought him to be educated at Athens, among the Aristotelian sect.\"\r\n\r\nSo absent-minded was he, the story is told of him, that going home to\r\nColsterworth, he led his horse up a hill. When he designed to remount,\r\nthe animal had slipped the bridle and gone away unperceived, though\r\nNewton held the bridle in his hand all the time. He would often sit down\r\non his bedside after he rose, and remain there for hours without\r\ndressing, so completely absorbed was he in his thought. How few in all\r\nthis world have been so devoted to science! And yet how many expect\r\nsuccess without this devotion!\r\n\r\nThe same gentleman writes of Newton, \"His carriage was very meek,\r\nsedate, and humble, never seemingly angry, of profound thought, his\r\ncountenance mild, pleasant, and comely. I cannot say I ever saw him\r\nlaugh but once.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1687, when Newton was forty-five, his _Philosophiae Naturalis\r\nPrincipia Mathematica_ was published. \"The _Principia_ consists of three\r\nbooks. The First Book, besides the definition and axioms, or laws of\r\nmotion, with which it begins, consists of fourteen sections, in the\r\nfirst of which the author explains the method of prime and ultimate\r\nratios used in his investigations, and which is similar to the method of\r\nfluxions. The other sections treat of centripetal forces, and motions in\r\nfixed and movable orbits.\r\n\r\n\"The Second Book consists of nine sections, and treats of bodies moving\r\nin resisting media, or oscillating as pendulums.\r\n\r\n\"The Third Book consists of five sections, on the Causes of the System\r\nof the World, on the Quantity of Lunar Errors, on the Quantity of the\r\nTides, on the Precession of the Equinoxes, and on Comets.\"\r\n\r\nThe great principle of the _Principia_ is universal gravitation, \"That\r\nevery particle of matter in the universe is attracted by or gravitates\r\nto every other particle of matter, with a force inversely proportional\r\nto the squares of their distances.\" By the laws of gravity, Newton was\r\nenabled to calculate the quantity of matter in the sun, and in all the\r\nplanets, and even to determine their density, results which Adam Smith\r\nsaid \"were above the reach of human reason and experience.\" He\r\nascertained that the weight of the same body would be twenty-three\r\ntimes greater at the surface of the sun than at the surface of the\r\nearth, and that the density of the earth was four times greater than\r\nthat of the sun. He found the true figure of the earth; he explained the\r\nphenomena of the tides.\r\n\r\nOf the \"Principia,\" Sir David Brewster says, in his able life of Sir\r\nIsaac Newton, it is \"a work which will be memorable not only in the\r\nannals of one science or of one country, but which will form an epoch in\r\nthe history of the world, and will ever be regarded as the brightest\r\npage in the records of human reason,--a work, may we not add, which\r\nwould be read with delight in every planet of our system,--in every\r\nsystem of the universe. What a glorious privilege was it to have been\r\nthe author of the 'Principia'!\r\n\r\n\"There was but one earth upon whose form, and tides, and movements, the\r\nphilosopher could exercise his genius,--one moon whose perturbations and\r\ninequalities and actions he could study,--one sun whose controlling\r\nforce and apparent motions he could calculate and determine,--one system\r\nof planets whose mutual disturbances could tax his highest reason,--one\r\nsystem of comets whose eccentric paths he could explore and\r\nrectify,--and one universe of stars to whose binary and multiple\r\ncombinations he could extend the law of terrestrial gravity.\r\n\r\n\"To have been the chosen sage summoned to the study of that earth, these\r\nsystems, and that universe, the favored lawgiver to worlds unnumbered,\r\nthe high priest in the temple of boundless space,--was a privilege that\r\ncould be granted but one member of the human family;--and to have\r\nexecuted the last was an achievement which, in its magnitude, can be\r\nmeasured only by the infinite in space, and in the duration of its\r\ntriumphs by the infinite in time. That sage,--that lawgiver,--that high\r\npriest was Newton.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Principia\" created the greatest interest throughout Europe, but met\r\nwith violent opposition. While Laplace said it would take \"pre-eminence\r\nabove all the other productions of human genius,\" the majority could not\r\nbelieve that great planets were suspended in empty space, and retained\r\nin their orbits by an invisible power in the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen Newton presented copies to the heads of colleges, some of them, Dr.\r\nBabington of Trinity among the number, said, \"they might study seven\r\nyears before they understood anything of it.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1687, Newton's method of fluxions was first published, twenty years\r\nafter its invention, and then because the friends of Leibnitz, the\r\nauthor of the \"Differential Calculus,\" claimed priority of discovery.\r\nThe quarrel aroused the scientific world, embittered the silent\r\nmathematician, and impaired his health.\r\n\r\nIn 1689, when he was forty-seven, he was chosen member of parliament,\r\nand represented Cambridge University in the House of Commons for\r\nthirteen months. He took no active part in the debates, but was of\r\ncourse respected for his wonderful mind.\r\n\r\nThis same year, his beloved mother died. Anxiously he had watched\r\nthrough whole nights by her bedside, seeking in all ways to keep her\r\nfrom leaving him alone in the world.\r\n\r\nHe was now nearly fifty. His life had been laborious, with an\r\ninsufficient income. His friends, John Locke among the number, tried to\r\nobtain various positions for him, but failed. They recommended him for\r\nprovost of King's College, but the position could not be obtained\r\nbecause he had not taken priest's orders.\r\n\r\nSeemingly unappreciated, worn with his incessant brain work, his\r\nappetite failing, and unable to sleep, with neither mother nor wife to\r\ncomfort him, the sensitive organization of the great man became\r\noverstrained, and mind and body were unfitted for work. It is stated\r\nthat his ill health was in part consequent upon the burning of some\r\nmanuscripts on optics, by a lighted candle on the table among his\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nWhen he was fifty-three, the long hard road of poverty turned into a\r\nhighway of plenty, through the influence of a friend. Charles Montague,\r\nan associate of Newton at the university and also in parliament, though\r\nnineteen years his junior,--intellectual affinities are uninfluenced by\r\nage,--had been made Commissioner of the Treasury, then Privy Councillor,\r\nthen Chancellor of the Exchequer, and later still, Baron of Halifax.\r\n\r\nLord Halifax appointed Newton to be Warden of the Mint, and then Master,\r\nwith an income of between six thousand and seven thousand five hundred\r\ndollars annually, which position he held for the remainder of his life.\r\nHis home in London, where he kept six servants, with his brilliant\r\nniece, Miss Catherine Barton, for his companion, became a place of rest\r\nand comfort to the tired philosopher. Lord Halifax was a great admirer\r\nof Newton's niece, Miss Catherine Barton, to whom he left, at his death,\r\na beautiful home and twenty-five thousand dollars, \"as a token of the\r\nsincere love, affection, and esteem I have long had for her person, and\r\nas a small recompense for the pleasure and happiness I have had in her\r\nconversation.\"\r\n\r\nThe days of privation were over, and Newton had earned this rest and\r\nprosperity. Great people often came to dine with him. At one of his\r\ndinners, Newton proposed to drink, not to the health of kings and\r\nprinces, but to all honest persons, to whatever country they belonged.\r\n\"We are all friends,\" he added, \"because we unanimously aim at the only\r\nobject worthy of man, which is the knowledge of truth. We are also of\r\nthe same religion, because, leading a simple life, we conform ourselves\r\nto what is right, and we endeavor sincerely to give to the Supreme Being\r\nthat worship which, according to our feeble lights, we are persuaded\r\nwill please him most.\"\r\n\r\nOther honors now come to Newton. In 1703, he was elected President of\r\nthe Royal Society, and was annually reelected during the remaining\r\ntwenty-five years of his life. On April 16, 1705, when he was\r\nsixty-three, Queen Anne conferred the honor of knighthood upon her most\r\nillustrious subject, Sir Isaac Newton, before a distinguished company at\r\nCambridge University. In 1704, the year previous, his great work on\r\noptics had been published, written over twenty years before.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, it seems that the great philosopher would have liked to\r\nmarry Lady Norris, the widow of Sir William Norris, Baronet of Speke,\r\nand Member of Parliament. Sent to Delhi as ambassador to the Great\r\nMogul, he died in 1702, between Mauritius and St. Helena, on his\r\nhomeward passage. He was the third husband to Lady Norris, and Sir\r\nIsaac, now over sixty, desired to be the fourth, as appears from the\r\nfollowing letter:--\r\n\r\n    \"Madam,--Your ladyship's great grief at the loss of Sir William\r\n    shows that if he had returned safe home, your ladyship could have\r\n    been glad to have lived still with a husband, and therefore your\r\n    aversion at present from marrying again can proceed from nothing\r\n    else than the memory of him whom you have lost. To be always\r\n    thinking on the dead, is to live a melancholy life among\r\n    sepulchres, and how much grief is an enemy to your health, is very\r\n    manifest by the sickness it brought when you received the first\r\n    news of your widowhood. And can your ladyship resolve to spend\r\n    the rest of your days in grief and sickness?\r\n\r\n    \"Can you resolve to wear a widow's habit perpetually,--a habit\r\n    which is less acceptable to company, a habit which will be always\r\n    putting you in mind of your lost husband, and thereby promote you\r\n    grief and indisposition till you leave it off? The proper remedy\r\n    for all these mischiefs is a new husband, and whether your\r\n    ladyship should admit of a proper remedy for such maladies, is a\r\n    question which I hope will not need much time to consider of.\r\n\r\n    \"Whether your ladyship should go constantly in the melancholy\r\n    dress of a widow, or flourish once more among the ladies; whether\r\n    you should spend the rest of your days cheerfully or in sadness,\r\n    in health or in sickness, are questions which need not much\r\n    consideration to decide them. Besides that your ladyship will be\r\n    better able to live according to your quality by the assistance of\r\n    a husband than upon your own estate alone; and, therefore, since\r\n    your ladyship likes the person proposed, I doubt not but in a\r\n    little time to have notice of your ladyship's inclinations to\r\n    marry, at least, that you will give him leave to discourse with\r\n    you about it.\r\n\r\n    \"I am, madam, your ladyship's most humble and most obedient\r\n    servant.\"\r\n\r\nIf Lady Norris \"liked the person proposed,\" as Sir Isaac imagined, a\r\nmarriage was not the result. It is just possible that he was like\r\nLeibnitz, who proposed to a lady when he was fifty. The lady asked for\r\ntime to take the matter into consideration, and as Leibnitz thus\r\nobtained leisure to consider the matter again, he was never married.\r\n\r\nFor thirteen years Sir Isaac lived on Jermyn Street, London; then moved\r\nto Chelsea, a place dear to those who love George Eliot or admire\r\nCarlyle; and then to Martin Street, near Leicester Fields.\r\n\r\nIn his latter years he wrote much on theological subjects, especially to\r\nprove the existence of a Deity. When he was eighty-three he published a\r\nthird edition of the \"Principia.\" At eighty-five he read manuscript\r\nwithout spectacles. He reasoned as acutely as ever, his memory alone\r\nfailing.\r\n\r\nOn March 2, 1727, he presided at a meeting of the Royal Society. He was\r\ntaken ill on the following day, and, although a great sufferer for\r\nseveral days, never uttered a complaint. He died on Monday, March 20,\r\nand his body was laid in the Jerusalem Chamber, and thence conveyed to\r\nWestminster Abbey for burial. The pall was supported by the Lord High\r\nChancellor and several Dukes and Earls.\r\n\r\nOn the front of his monument are sculptured youths, bearing in their\r\nhands emblematic designs of Newton's principal discoveries. One carries\r\na prism, another a reflecting telescope, a third is weighing the sun and\r\nplanets with a steelyard, a fourth is employed about a furnace, and two\r\nothers are loaded with money newly coined. The monument bears this\r\ninscription.\r\n\r\n                       HERE LIES\r\n               SIR ISAAC NEWTON, KNIGHT,\r\n      Who by a vigor of mind, almost supernatural,\r\n                   First demonstrated\r\n         The motions and figures of the Planets,\r\n            The Paths of the Comets, and the\r\n                   Tides of the Ocean.\r\n               He diligently investigated\r\n  The different refrangibilities of the Rays of Light,\r\n       And the properties of the Colors to which\r\n                     they give rise.\r\n   An Assiduous, Sagacious, and Faithful Interpreter\r\n     of Nature, Antiquity, and the Holy Scriptures,\r\n      He asserted in his Philosophy the Majesty of\r\n         God, and exhibited in his Conduct the\r\n               simplicity of the Gospel.\r\n       Let Mortals rejoice that there has existed\r\n                   such and so great\r\n\r\n             AN ORNAMENT OF THE HUMAN RACE.\r\n\r\n        Born 25 Dec., 1642; Died 20 March, 1727.\r\n\r\nA beautiful full-length, white marble statue of Sir Isaac was erected in\r\nthe ante-chapel of Trinity College, where he had done his wonderful\r\nwork, when scarcely more than a boy.\r\n\r\nWhile he gave generously during his life, he said, \"they who give\r\nnothing till they die, never give at all,\"--he left a personal estate of\r\none hundred and sixty thousand dollars, to be divided among his nephews\r\nand nieces.\r\n\r\nThe world honored him at last, and has through all the years. Bishop\r\nBurnet said, \"Newton had the _whitest_ soul he ever knew.\" His habits\r\nwere of the best. When asked to take snuff or tobacco, he declined,\r\nsaying, \"he would make no necessities to himself.\"\r\n\r\nHe was modest to the last, saying, \"that whatever service he had done\r\nthe public was not owing to any extraordinary sagacity, but solely to\r\nindustry and patient thought.\" He said, a short time before his death:\r\n\"I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to\r\nhave been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself\r\nin now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than\r\nordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARL LINNAEUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARL LINNAEUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the 24th of July that we left Stockholm, the Venice of the\r\nNorth, built on her nine islands, for the famous university town of\r\nUpsala, Sweden. The ride, of about two hours by rail, lay along fine\r\nfields of wheat, blue with corn-flowers, and past comfortable-looking\r\nred farmhouses and barns.\r\n\r\nThe town, of thirteen thousand people, is quaint and quiet, yet most\r\ninteresting to a stranger. We wander over the grand old Gothic\r\ncathedral, begun six hundred years ago. Here is the silver-gilt\r\nsarcophagus of King Eric IX., who died in 1160, and of John III. Here,\r\nalso, that of Gustavus Vasa, the deliverer of Sweden, on a high marble\r\npedestal supported by pillars, a recumbent figure of a wife on either\r\nside. A third wife is buried near by. The walls of the chapel where he\r\nlies are covered with frescoes, depicting scenes in that wonderful life;\r\nfrom the rags of the miner, to the sumptuousness of the throne.\r\n\r\nBut especially are we interested in a plain slab, underneath which\r\nsleeps the man who, more than any other, has immortalized Upsala\r\nUniversity, and helped to make Sweden an intellectual and studious\r\ncountry. Near by is the monument of dark porphyry, with the plain,\r\nshaven face in bronze, wreathed with laurel, and the words \"_Carolo a\r\nLinne Botanicorum Principi Amici et Discipuli, 1798._\"\r\n\r\nThen we turn our steps to the University, the pride and hope of Sweden.\r\nHere fifteen hundred gather, not in dormitories--which were tried fifty\r\nyears ago and discarded--but scattered in various homes, as in the\r\nGerman universities. Women are educated here on equal terms with men,\r\nand we are assured by the professors that, though admitted only a few\r\nyears ago, their presence is most helpful, and the plan has proved\r\nentirely successful. No duels are allowed, these having been abolished\r\nby stringent laws two hundred years ago; a thing Germany should long\r\nsince have done, and thus ended this brutal custom.\r\n\r\nHere is the Astronomical Observatory, the Chemical Laboratory, Anatomy\r\nBuilding, Academic Department, and handsome library with two hundred\r\nthousand volumes and over seven thousand manuscripts. Here we look at\r\nthe celebrated \"Codex Argenteus,\" a translation of the four Gospels by\r\nBishop Ulfila, dating from the second half of the fourth century,\r\nwritten on one hundred and eighty-eight leaves of parchment--gold and\r\nsilver letters on a reddish ground; and the manuscript of Frithiof's\r\nSaga, by Tegner.\r\n\r\nNow we visit the Botanic Garden, which Linnaeus so loved and developed,\r\nand go over the two-and-a-half-story stuccoed house, cream-colored,\r\nwhere the great naturalist lived and entertained princes. Under these\r\ndark poplars, enormous in size, he taught the pupils who came from all\r\nparts of the world to hear him. The dark, closed blinds are as he left\r\nthem, for Sweden would not change one thing about the precious home. Too\r\nlittle in our own country do we treasure the homes of those who give\r\nhonor to the nation.\r\n\r\nThe history of Linnaeus is, indeed, a romance. Few have had such great\r\nstruggles with poverty; few have come off such conquerors. Few lives\r\nhave given to the world such lessons of cheerfulness, of perseverance,\r\nand of untiring industry. He was born, May, 1707, at Rashult, in the\r\nsouth of Sweden, the son of a poor minister, and the eldest of five\r\nchildren. The father, Nils Linnaeus, had obtained his education by the\r\nhardest toil, and, while he had only poverty to offer his family, he\r\ngave them what money could not buy, tender affection, and the inspiring\r\ninfluence of a cultivated mind that loved nature and studied her\r\nclosely. His mother, Christina, a woman of sense, prudence, and good\r\njudgment, was his idol. He wrote of her in later years: \"She possessed\r\nall the virtues of her sex, devoting the utmost attention to impressing\r\non my mind the love of virtue, both in precept and example.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a child he was fond of his father's garden, and gathered from the\r\nfields all kinds of wild flowers. He says of himself in his\r\nautobiography: \"He was scarcely four years old when he accompanied his\r\nfather at a feast at Moekler, and in the evening, it being a very\r\npleasant season of the year, the guests seated themselves on some\r\nflowery turf, listening to the pastor, who made various remarks on the\r\nnames and properties of the plants, showing them the roots of the\r\nsuccisa, tormentilla, orchids, etc. The child paid the most\r\nuninterrupted attention to all he saw and heard, and from that hour\r\nnever ceased harassing his father about the name, qualities, and nature\r\nof every plant he met with; indeed, he very often asked more than his\r\nfather was able to answer, but, like other children, he used immediately\r\nto forget what he had learned, and especially the _names_ of plants.\r\nHence the father was sometimes put out of humor, and refused to answer\r\nhim unless he would promise to remember what was told him. Nor had this\r\nharshness any bad effect, for he afterward retained with ease whatever\r\nhe heard.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was eight, a piece of ground was assigned him, which was called\r\n\"Carl's Garden.\" Here he gathered plants and flowers, and introduced so\r\nmany rare weeds that his father had great trouble in eradicating them!\r\nSo interested did Carl become, that he had nests of wild bees and wasps,\r\nnot agreeable playthings usually.\r\n\r\nBut the play days with weeds and wasps came to an end, for the bright\r\nboy had to go to school. His first teacher was \"a passionate and morose\r\nman, better calculated for extinguishing a youth's talents than for\r\nimproving them,\" and the next \"pursued the same methods, preferring\r\nstripes and punishments to encouragements and admonitions.\" There was\r\nlittle time now for the precious study of flowers. At seventeen he had\r\nto go to a gymnasium or high school, where he would be taught classics,\r\nand made ready for the ministry, like his father. He had no fondness for\r\nthe languages, neither for theology or metaphysics: but having obtained\r\ntwo books on botany, he read them day and night, committing them to\r\nmemory. The teachers and scholars called him \"the little botanist.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was his father's chagrin, when he came to the school to visit him,\r\nto hear that Carl was quite unfit for the ministry, but would probably\r\nmake a good tailor or shoemaker! Poor as he was, he had kept his boy at\r\nschool for about twelve years. Now, well-nigh disheartened, he stopped,\r\non his way home, to confer with his family physician, Dr. Rothmann. That\r\ngood man suggested that the boy might like medicine, and accomplish\r\ngreat things in natural history. He offered to take him into his own\r\nhome, and give him lessons in physiology, which kind proposal the father\r\naccepted, though with little faith. The doctor also taught him botany,\r\nand Carl grew happy under the new _regime_.\r\n\r\nThe next year he was sent to the University of Lund, with the following\r\nnot very creditable certificate from the head master of the Gymnasium:\r\n\"Youth at school may be compared to shrubs in a garden, which will\r\nsometimes, though rarely, elude all the care of the gardener, but if\r\ntransplanted into a different soil, may become fruitful trees. With this\r\nview, therefore, and no other, the bearer is sent to the University,\r\nwhere it is possible that he may meet with a climate propitious to his\r\nprogress.\" Through a friend, entrance was obtained without showing the\r\nobnoxious certificate.\r\n\r\nCarl took lodgings at the house of Dr. Stobaeus, physician to the king,\r\nwho gave him access to his minerals, shells, and dried plants. Delighted\r\nat this, the youth at once began to make a collection of his own, and\r\nglue them on paper. He longed to gain access to Dr. Stobaeus's library,\r\nbut how should it be accomplished? Finally a young German student, to\r\nwhom he taught physiology, surreptitiously gained the books needed, and\r\nyoung Linnaeus spent nearly the whole nights in reading. The doctor's\r\naged mother did not understand why their lodger kept his light burning\r\ninto the small hours, and besought her son to investigate. He did so,\r\nand found the crestfallen Carl reading his own library books. He forgave\r\nthe student, took him to his own table and treated him as a son.\r\n\r\nAdvised by Dr. Rothmann to go to Upsala for better medical\r\nopportunities, he proceeded thither, and here began his bitterest\r\npoverty. His father could give him only forty dollars. As he was\r\nunknown, and without influence, he could obtain no private pupils.\r\nStarvation actually stared him in the face. He says, \"he was obliged to\r\ntrust to chance for a meal, and in the article of dress, was reduced to\r\nsuch shifts that he was obliged, when his shoes required mending, to\r\npatch them with folded paper, instead of sending them to the cobbler.\"\r\nOften hungry and half clothed, there seemed nothing before the poor\r\nSwedish lad but obscurity and early death.\r\n\r\nOne day in autumn, as he was examining some plants in the Academical\r\nGarden, a venerable clergyman, Dr. Olaf Celsius, saw him, and asked him\r\nwhere he came from, how long he had been at the college, and what he\r\nknew about plants. He, too, was interested in botany, and was preparing\r\na work on the plants mentioned in the Bible. Perhaps something in Carl's\r\nface or manner touched the minister's heart, for he asked him to go home\r\nwith him, and soon offered him board in his own house, and gave him\r\naccess to his valuable library.\r\n\r\nThe tide of adversity was beginning to turn. Some pupils were obtained,\r\nand a little money flowed into the empty pockets. At twenty-two, by a\r\nclose examination of the stamens and pistils of flowers, he decided upon\r\na new method of arrangement by the sexes of plants, which, in after\r\nyears, became the basis of his great fame. This procured him the\r\nappointment of Assistant Lecturer to Dr. Rudbeck in the Botanical\r\nGarden, where, but a year before, he had asked to be the gardener!\r\n\r\nHe still had little money, but, what was equally useful, some leisure\r\ntime. He began his great works, which were not completed for seven\r\nyears, \"Bibliotheca Botanica,\" \"Classes Plantarum,\" \"Critica Botanica,\"\r\nand \"Genera Plantarum,\" \"letting,\" as he said, \"not a minute pass\r\nunoccupied during his residence at Upsala. For the latter work he\r\nexamined the characters of eight thousand flowers.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had he begun this valuable labor, when the envy of one of the\r\nprofessors became as hard to bear as his previous poverty, and, through\r\nfriends, he obtained an appointment to study the natural history of\r\nLapland. It was a hazardous expedition for a young man of twenty-five.\r\nNow he climbed steep rocks, \"which,\" he says, \"broke loose from a spot\r\nwhich my late guide had just passed, and fell exactly where I had been,\r\nwith such force that it struck fire as it went.\" Once, when floating\r\ndown a river, the raft parted in the middle, and he narrowly escaped\r\ndrowning. \"All my food,\" he says, \"in those fatiguing excursions,\r\nconsisted, for the most part, of fish and reindeer's milk. Bread, salt,\r\nand what is found everywhere else, did but seldom recreate my palate.\"\r\nHe travelled nearly four thousand miles, mostly on foot, often through\r\nbogs and marshes, with the water to his knees, yet always cheerful,\r\nalways enthusiastic. On presenting his report to the University, on his\r\nreturn home, they gave him about fifty dollars for his travelling\r\nexpenses for five months!\r\n\r\nA single incident shows the tender heart of the young explorer. Very few\r\nbirds were visible except the ptarmigan. He says: \"The little Alpine\r\nvariety of the ptarmigan was now accompanied by its young. I caught one\r\nof these, upon which the hen ran so close to me that I could easily have\r\ntaken her also. She kept continually jumping round and round me, but I\r\nthought it a pity to deprive the tender brood of their mother; neither\r\nwould my compassion for the mother allow me long to detain her\r\noffspring, which I returned to her in safety.\" Tenderness to animals\r\nseems to be a striking characteristic of great men and women.\r\n\r\nDuring the journey, he found a modest little flower in the great\r\nnorthern forests, in the moss, and this he named _Linnaea borealis_,\r\nthinking it was so like himself, expanding in obscurity. He chose for\r\nhis motto, _Tantus amor florum_, \"So great is the love for flowers.\"\r\n\r\nOn his return to Upsala, he began courses of private lectures in\r\nmedicine, but so bitter was the envy of the before-mentioned professor\r\nthat the archbishop was prevailed upon to prohibit private lectures.\r\nThus deprived of a livelihood, Linnaeus turned his attention to\r\nmineralogy, visiting the Swedish mines. The Governor of Dalecarlia was\r\nso pleased with him that he engaged him to investigate the productions\r\nof his country. Here he fell in love with the daughter of John Moraeus, a\r\nwell-to-do physician.\r\n\r\nSara Elizabeth reciprocated the affections of the young man, who was\r\ntold by the father that he must wait three years for a final answer;\r\nfor, in truth, Linnaeus's financial prospects were not bright. The\r\nUniversity of Upsala did not want him, and there seemed to be no hope of\r\nwriting or publishing his books on botany. But a man usually achieves\r\nlittle, who does not fight his way at every step. Now, indeed, for\r\nlove's sake he must make his mark.\r\n\r\nAfter saving about seventy-five dollars, he decided to go to Germany,\r\nand take his doctor's degree; but first he must visit his home, out of\r\nwhich his beloved mother had gone at forty-five. \"Alas! alas, my\r\nmother!\" was all he could say, as the tears fell fast upon her grave.\r\nShe had witnessed his poverty and his heroism; she was not to witness\r\nhis great renown.\r\n\r\nAt Hamburg he spent a month, receiving civilities from many scientific\r\nmen. He showed his good sense in feeling in no wise humiliated because\r\nhe was poor, a valuable lesson for poor young men and women to learn. At\r\nLeyden, good fortune came to him. Dr. Gronovius was so pleased with the\r\nmanuscript of his \"Systema Naturae\" that he requested to publish it at\r\nhis own expense. By his advice, Carl waited upon the celebrated\r\nphysician, Boerhaave, and after eight days gained admittance. So famous\r\nwas this man that when the Emperor of China sent a letter to \"Boerhaave,\r\nthe famous physician in Europe,\" it easily reached him. He advised a\r\nrich banker, Mr. Clifford, to have Linnaeus describe his magnificent\r\ncollection of plants, and to send him to England and elsewhere, to\r\ncollect specimens for him. This was indeed a blessing. \"Here in\r\nEngland,\" he says, \"I lived like a prince, and had one of the finest\r\ngardens of the world under my inspection.\" A society in Amsterdam\r\nadvanced the money to pay for the plates for his \"Flora Lapponica,\" and\r\nfame seemed really to be coming at last.\r\n\r\nIn his visit to England, Sir Hans Sloane, who founded the British\r\nMuseum, looked upon him coldly because he had suggested a different\r\nsystem in natural history from his own! At Oxford, Dillenius said to\r\nfriends, sarcastically: \"See, this is the young man who confounds all\r\nbotany!\" Linnaeus felt hurt, and, when about to take his departure from\r\nthe city, asked the scientist why he had treated him thus. After the\r\nyoung student had explained his work, Dillenius became his warm friend,\r\nand pressed him to stay, and even to share his salary with him. Linnaeus\r\nwas greatly pleased with London, and when he saw the golden furze in its\r\ngreen leaves, fell on his knees before it.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Germany he went to the death-bed of Boerhaave, whose\r\nparting words were: \"I have lived out my time and done what I could. May\r\nGod preserve thee, from whom the world expects much more! Farewell, my\r\ndear Linnaeus!\"\r\n\r\nHe now hastened to the idol of his heart in Sweden, and what was his\r\namazement to find that the friend to whom he had intrusted his\r\ncorrespondence with Sara Elizabeth had been trying to win her for\r\nhimself! Perhaps it would have been quite as well for Linnaeus had he\r\nsucceeded! However, matters were amicably adjusted, and the long waiting\r\nlover became engaged.\r\n\r\nHe repaired at once to Stockholm to begin the practice of medicine,\r\nstill keeping as near Upsala University as possible. And here troubles\r\nbegan anew. He says: \"Being unknown to everybody, people were unwilling\r\nto trust their lives in my hands. Nay, they even hesitated to trust me\r\nwith their dogs! Abroad, I had been honored in every place as Princeps\r\nBotanicorum; but in my own country I was looked upon as a _Klim_, newly\r\narrived from the subterranean regions! No one cared how many sleepless\r\nnights and toilsome hours I passed. Had I not been in love I would\r\ncertainly have left Sweden and gone abroad.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a time a fortunate cure effected by him brought him speedy\r\npopularity. \"No invalid could now recover without my assistance. I was\r\nbusy from four in the morning till late in the evening; nor were my\r\nnights left undisturbed.\" He was soon chosen a member of the Upsala\r\nAcademy, and at the request of the king, through his tutor, Count\r\nTessin, gave public lectures on botany and mineralogy.\r\n\r\nAnd now the rising botanist desired to claim his bride. They were\r\naccordingly married June 26, 1739, when Linnaeus was thirty-two. Dr.\r\nMoraeus had waited long enough to see that his daughter was making no\r\nmistake. Life now flowed on smoothly. If the \"little wife,\" as he called\r\nher, governed him with no very gentle sway in after years, she had\r\ngreat influence over him, and it is said that at her instigation he\r\npersecuted his only son. All the more is Linnaeus to be admired for\r\naccomplishing such a grand work with domestic hindrances. It takes a\r\nvery great man to be great when his home is not a help to him! However,\r\nhe always regarded her as \"one of the choicest gifts bestowed upon him.\"\r\n\r\nHis medical practice brought him plenty of money, but he wrote to a\r\nfriend: \"Once I had plants and no money: now what is money good for\r\nwithout plants?\" Soon the desire of his heart was granted, and he was\r\nmade Professor of Botany at Upsala University, also superintendent of\r\nthe Botanical Garden.\r\n\r\nNow he says: \"I render thanks to the Almighty, who has ordered my lot so\r\nthat I live at this day; and live, too, happier than the King of Persia.\r\nI think myself thus blessed because in this academic garden I am\r\nprincipal. This is my Rhodus, or, rather, my Elysium; here I enjoy the\r\nspoils of the East and the West, and, if I mistake not, that which far\r\nexcels in beauty the garments of the Babylonians and the porcelain of\r\nChina.\"\r\n\r\nHis fame grew rapidly. He published, in 1745, his \"Flora Suecica,\" and a\r\nyear later his \"Fauna Suecica,\" a description of Swedish plants and\r\nanimals. His lectures soon, by their enthusiasm and eloquence, brought\r\nlisteners from all parts of Europe. The number of students in the\r\nuniversity grew from five hundred to fifteen hundred, young men coming\r\neven from America to hear the great botanist. During the summer he made\r\nexcursions twice a week, often at the head of two hundred students, and\r\nwhen some rare plant was discovered, the news was announced to the\r\nothers by horn or trumpet. His scholars, imbued with his spirit, went\r\nover the world in scientific investigation. Some died in the Arabian\r\ndeserts; some in the swamps of Africa. From foreign students he would\r\ntake no fee, as he desired to show them how he loved his work. Once he\r\nsaid to a German student: \"Tell me, candidly, are you rich, and can you\r\nafford it? If you can, then give the money to my wife; but, if you be\r\npoor, so help me Heaven, I will not take a single farthing from you!\"\r\n\r\nMost of the scientific societies of Europe made him a member after his\r\ngreat works were published. The Imperial Academy called him \"Dioscorides\r\nSecundus\"; a gold medal was struck in his honor in 1746, and the king\r\nmade him dean of the College of Physicians. He published two valuable\r\nmedical books, and received the honor of the Knight of the Polar Star,\r\nnever before conferred for literary merit. He was made a noble, and took\r\nfor his motto, _Famam extendere factis_, adorning his crest with the\r\nlittle flower which he discovered in his poverty. He was made rector of\r\nthe university, holding the position for several years. How different\r\nfrom the time when he could obtain only a chance meal, and covered up\r\nthe holes in his torn shoes!\r\n\r\nHe bought two estates, living at one of them--Hammerby--for fifteen\r\nyears. In 1774, when he was sixty-seven, he suffered an attack of\r\napoplexy in the Botanical Garden, and, two years later, another stroke\r\nmade him a paralytic. When he could no longer walk, he used to be\r\ncarried to his museum, and look long and earnestly at his treasures,\r\ngathered from every clime. His memory so failed him that he mixed the\r\nGreek and Latin letters, and forgot even his own name. On the 10th of\r\nJanuary, 1778, death came to him in his sleep.\r\n\r\nThe university went into mourning, the king made a public address, and\r\nthe whole nation regarded it as an irreparable loss. His herbarium and\r\nlibrary were sold, after a time, by the wife, to Sir James E. Smith, the\r\nfounder of the Linnaean Society, of London, where these treasures are now\r\nto be seen, and most of the one hundred and eighty works which he\r\npublished during forty-five years. It is said that the King of Sweden,\r\non learning that the work of Linnaeus was going out of the country, sent\r\na man-of-war to recover it, but without avail.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus was small in body, with large head, and the bright, piercing\r\neyes which usually characterize men and women of genius.\r\n\r\nOf his six children, the oldest soon became professor of botany, to\r\nassist, and then succeed, his father, but he lacked the parent's just\r\nand honorable love of fame. The eldest daughter inherited much of his\r\nability, being the first to discover the luminous property of the\r\nnasturtium flowers at night. Sara Elizabeth survived her noble husband\r\nmany years, and now lies beside him in the cathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARON CUVIER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARON CUVIER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the town of Montbeliard, France, then belonging to the Duke of\r\nWuertemberg, August 23, 1769, was born the founder of the Science of\r\nComparative Anatomy; the greatest naturalist of his time, Georges\r\nLeopold Chretien Frederic Dagobert Cuvier. His father was a brave\r\nofficer in a Swiss regiment, who at fifty married a young lady of\r\nunusual ability. Their first son died, and the second, Georges, was so\r\nfeeble in constitution that his life was saved only by the tenderest\r\ncare of his mother.\r\n\r\nFor this mother the boy cherished the most ardent affection. While she\r\nlived, there was nothing left undone that a loving nature could do for\r\nher. When she died, everything connected with her memory became sacred.\r\nWhen Cuvier had become honored by kings and nobles, when the great from\r\nall the world delighted to bring him offerings, nothing so touched his\r\nheart as the gift of a bouquet of red stocks, her favorite flower.\r\nPerchance the benignity that came into his face in later years was the\r\nresult of these sweet remembrances.\r\n\r\nShe taught him to read at four, and, though ignorant of Latin, she made\r\nhim repeat his lessons to her daily, so that he was the best prepared of\r\nany boy in school. She read to him history and general literature. She\r\nmade him draw under her inspection. She talked with him about books till\r\na passion for reading became the chief characteristic of his nature. No\r\nwonder that he loved such an inspiring woman. The history of most great\r\nmen emphasizes the fact that the mothers cannot be too highly educated.\r\nAt ten years of age he was placed in a high school, called a Gymnase,\r\nwhere for four years he studied Latin, Greek, history, geography, and\r\nmathematics, and was constantly at the head of his classes. Naturally\r\nenthusiastic, he played as heartily as he studied.\r\n\r\nAs is often the case, a book turned the course of his life, and made him\r\nfamous. At the Gymnase he found a work of Gesner, the Swiss naturalist,\r\nand this, with its colored plates, first turned his attention to natural\r\nhistory. This liking was intensified by finding at the house of a\r\nrelative the complete works of Buffon, the noted naturalist, who wrote\r\nthirty-six volumes in his own brilliant and poetic style, describing the\r\nanimal kingdom. The boy became intensely interested in the habits of\r\nquadrupeds and birds; their form, their color, and their homes. He\r\ncopied the illustrations in the work, and colored them with paint or\r\npieces of silk. He always carried a volume of Buffon in his pocket to\r\nread when he had a moment of leisure. At twelve, he was a well-read\r\nnaturalist.\r\n\r\nIn his last year in the Gymnase, when he was fourteen, he chose a\r\ncertain number of his school-fellows, and formed an Academy. Every\r\nThursday he gathered the lads into his room, and placing them around a\r\ntable, seated himself upon his bed, and after some book had been read on\r\nnatural history, philosophy, history, or travels, he asked their\r\nopinions of it, and then, being president, summed up the argument in a\r\nclear and concise manner. The mother's seed-sowing in the mind of her\r\nardent boy was bearing fruit.\r\n\r\nAs the family were poor, and had only a soldier's pension to support\r\nthem, it was decided that Georges should enter the free school at\r\nTuebingen, and prepare for the church. But the principal of the Gymnase,\r\nwho had never forgiven the boy for some playful trick, placed his\r\ncomposition in the third rank. Georges knew that it deserved the first\r\nrank, and that this low standard would affect his position in college.\r\nHe, therefore, resolved not to enter Tuebingen, and, though he was\r\nthereby lost to the church, he was saved for great scientific work.\r\n\r\nA fortunate thing now happened. A woman, a princess, who knew about the\r\nbright boy, spoke of him to her brother, Duke Charles of Wuertemberg.\r\nWhen the duke visited Montbeliard, he sent for the lad, questioned him\r\nas to what he had learned, asked to see his drawings, and ended by\r\nsending him free of expense to the University of Stuttgart, to enter his\r\nown Academy, called the Academy Caroline. It seemed a little thing for a\r\nlady to speak of a boy's studiousness and great love of books, but it\r\nproved a great thing for Georges Cuvier and for the scientific world.\r\nThousands of women and men could do more of these little acts of\r\nkindness, if they only thought of it. Well said Thomas Hood:--\r\n\r\n  \"Evil is wrought by want of thought,\r\n  As well as want of heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy of fourteen said good-by to his devoted mother, and started for\r\nStuttgart, seated between the Chamberlain and the Secretary of the Grand\r\nDuke. Both spoke German all the way, and the lonesome boy did not\r\nunderstand a word. He entered the Academy May 4, 1784, and for four\r\nyears studied mathematics, law, philosophy, finance, and the like.\r\n\r\nBut he lost no opportunity to study natural history. A professor gave\r\nhim the works of Linnaeus, and he gained inspiration from the young man\r\nwho could travel four thousand miles through the marshes of Lapland,\r\nnearly barefoot and half-starved, in his study of plants. Georges now\r\ncollected a herbarium. When he had leisure, he drew and colored insects,\r\nbirds, and flowers with great accuracy. He kept a number of living\r\ninsects in his room, constantly feeding them, and watching their habits.\r\nHe said years afterward, \"If I had not studied insects from choice, when\r\nI was at college, I should have done so later, from a conviction of its\r\nnecessity.\" He declared that the wonders he met with in the\r\norganization of insects always elevated his thoughts.\r\n\r\nNine months after his arrival in Germany, he won the prize at the\r\nAcademy for excellence in the German language, receiving the order of\r\nChevalerie, an honor given only to five or six out of four hundred\r\npupils. This entitled the recipients to dine at a separate table, and to\r\nenjoy many advantages under the immediate patronage of the Grand Duke.\r\n\r\nWhen the four years of college life were over, the father's pension\r\nhaving ceased on account of the disturbed financial condition of France,\r\nthe youth of eighteen needed to find employment at once. Nothing seemed\r\nopen to him but the position of tutor in a private family, a thing much\r\ndeprecated by his school-fellows, who had already built many air-castles\r\nfor his future.\r\n\r\nBut young Cuvier had the courage and the wisdom to do what necessity\r\nrequired, and to do it cheerfully. In July, 1788, he entered the family\r\nof Count d'Hericy in Caen, Normandy, and for six years taught his only\r\nson. He took with him, says a friend, \"these admirable foundations for\r\nglory: a love of labor, depth of reflection, perseverance, and\r\nuprightness of character.\" While teaching here, he met the nobility of\r\nthe surrounding country, increasing thereby his polish of manner and\r\ntact, for which he was celebrated all his life.\r\n\r\nLiving by the sea, he was led to study marine animals. The casual\r\ndissection of a calamar, a species of cuttle-fish, influenced him to\r\nstudy the anatomy of mollusca, which afterward led to his great\r\nclassification of the whole animal kingdom. In this obscure corner of\r\nNormandy, the young teacher observed, and committed his observations to\r\npaper. Some young men would not have found time for such work. Those\r\nonly succeed who have sufficient force of character to make time for\r\nwhat they wish to do. To allow one's time to be wasted, is to allow\r\none's opportunities for eminence to go by forever.\r\n\r\nNearly every evening Cuvier attended a small society of which he was\r\nsecretary, which gathered chiefly to discuss agricultural and kindred\r\ntopics. M. Tessier, living there in exile under an assumed name, the\r\nauthor of several valuable articles in the Encyclopedia, was often\r\npresent, and between him and the young secretary a warm friendship soon\r\nexisted. As the friendship of the Marquis Guidubaldo proved valuable to\r\nGalileo, so that of M. Tessier proved of great benefit to Cuvier. He led\r\nthe young and comparatively unknown naturalist, though some of his\r\narticles had been published in learned journals, to correspond with\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire, De Lacepede, and others on scientific subjects.\r\nThrough their influence he was finally called to Paris, made a member of\r\nthe Commission of Arts, and professor at the Central School of the\r\nPantheon.\r\n\r\nHe was only twenty-six, and this was but the beginning of honors. Here\r\nhe composed his \"Elementary Treatise on the Natural History of\r\nAnimals.\" His great desire was to be attached to the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory, where he could study the collections and enlarge them. Very\r\nsoon after his arrival in Paris, M. Mertrud was appointed to the newly\r\ncreated chair of Comparative Anatomy at the Jardin des Plantes. He was\r\nadvanced in years. And now came the opportunity for friendship to do its\r\nwork. Geoffroy St. Hilaire and De Lacepede were his colleagues. They\r\nurged that their friend Cuvier be appointed assistant, and Mertrud\r\ngladly consented. This was indeed an honor, since Daubenton, Buffon,\r\nLamarck, and other European celebrities had filled this position.\r\n\r\nCuvier at once sent for his aged father, now nearly eighty years old,\r\nand his only brother, Frederic, to make their home with him. The\r\nprecious mother had died two years previously. She did not live to see\r\nthe fame of her eldest son, but she must have been convinced of his\r\nfuture greatness, and been comforted by the prospect.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of entering upon his new work, Cuvier began to develop\r\nthat wonderful collection in comparative anatomy which is now so\r\ncelebrated. Nothing ever turned him from his purpose of making this the\r\nmost extensive collection in the world; no sorrow, no legislative\r\nduties, no absence. No one who has visited Paris will ever forget the\r\nseventy-five acres in the Jardin des Plantes, with trees and flowers\r\nfrom all the world; with thirteen rooms filled with skeletons and\r\nanatomical preparations of all kinds; with eleven rooms in the gallery\r\nof anthropology containing every variety of the human species, in casts,\r\nmummies, and fossils; with the gallery of zooelogy containing over two\r\nthousand mammalia, belonging to five hundred species, as many reptiles,\r\nten thousand birds, and over twenty-five hundred fishes; with immense\r\ngeological, mineralogical, and botanical collections; all a marvel of\r\nindustry and learning.\r\n\r\nCuvier now worked unceasingly. Sometimes his salary was in arrears, but\r\nhe bore it cheerfully, as he wrote a friend: \"You are not to suppose\r\nthat Paris is so highly favored; for twelve months' pay are now due at\r\nthe Jardin des Plantes, and all the national establishments for public\r\ninstruction, in Paris as well as at Strasburg; and if we envy the\r\nelephants, it is not because they are better paid than we are, but\r\nbecause while living on credit, as we do, they are not aware of it, and\r\nconsequently are insensible to the pain it gives. You know the saying\r\nabout the French, that when they have no money they sing. We savants,\r\nwho are not musicians, work at our sciences instead of singing, which\r\ncomes to the same thing.\" He is a hero, indeed, who can breast poverty,\r\nand work and sing in the midst of hardship. When he published his\r\n\"Annals of the Museum,\" he not only drew, but often engraved the plates\r\nhimself, when he was unable, for lack of means, to hire it done.\r\n\r\nThe National Institution was founded in 1796, and Cuvier was associated\r\nwith his friends De Lacepede and Daubenton, in the section of zooelogy,\r\nholding the position of Secretary of Natural Sciences till his death.\r\n\r\nFour years later, in 1800, the first two volumes of his \"Lessons in\r\nComparative Anatomy\" were published, and met with great success. The\r\nlast three volumes were issued five years later.\r\n\r\nIn this year, 1800, Cuvier received another honor, that of the\r\nprofessorship of Natural Philosophy in the College de France. He was now\r\nbut thirty-one. The following year, Napoleon I., who was usually wise in\r\nhis selection of men, appointed him one of the six inspectors-general of\r\neducation, to establish public schools in thirty towns of France.\r\n\r\nEvery moment now seemed occupied, and yet while the brain was busy\r\nperchance the heart was lonely. The father had died two years after the\r\nmother. The wife of his brother Frederic had died, also, and the two\r\nbrothers were left alone. At thirty-four, Cuvier decided to take into\r\nhis heart and home the widow of M. Duvaucel, Fermier-General, who had\r\nperished on the scaffold in 1794. The family had lost all their money in\r\nthe French Revolution, and Madame Duvaucel had four large children to be\r\nsupported; but Cuvier loved her for her rare mind and sweet disposition,\r\nand she blessed the remaining years of his life. An educated man needs\r\ncompanionship in mind; not simply a housekeeper.\r\n\r\nSix years later one of her sons was assassinated in Portugal, during the\r\nretreat of the French army. Another, while collecting for the Museum of\r\nParis, died in Madras, a young man of great talent and much beloved. A\r\ndaughter, Mlle. Duvaucel, lived to be the comfort of Cuvier's declining\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHappy in his home and absorbed with his work, Cuvier went forward to new\r\nlabors and new honors. M. Mertrud had died, and, instead of being\r\nassistant at the Jardin des Plantes, Cuvier was now professor. In 1808\r\nNapoleon made him counsellor for life of the Imperial University. The\r\nnext year he organized new academies in the Italian States, which were\r\nnow annexed to France. In 1811 he was sent on a similar mission to\r\nHolland and the Hanseatic towns, and was made a chevalier, which rank\r\nwas assured to his heirs. Though he disliked to be absent from his\r\nfamily, he went where duty called him, and wrote back fond letters to\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n\"MY TENDER FRIEND,--The weather, the road, the horses, and the\r\npostilions have proved so excellent that we have reached Porte Sainte\r\nMayence before six o'clock; and I have bitterly regretted the two or\r\nthree good hours that I might still have passed with thee, without in\r\nthe least delaying my journey. At least believe that I have passed them\r\nin my imagination, and that the remembrance of thy caresses and tender\r\nfriendship will form the happiness of my whole way.\" After some words to\r\nthe children, he added, \"We are quite well, my good friend; we have\r\ncrossed an agreeable country; and we are in a tolerable inn. Our\r\ncarriage appears to be quite able to bear the journey; thus, up to this\r\nmoment, all goes well. Pray to God that this may last; thou art so good\r\nthat he cannot refuse thee. Adieu. A thousand tender kisses. G. C.\"\r\n\r\nThis year, 1811, appeared one of his most important works--that on\r\n\"Fossil Remains,\" which wrought a revolution in the study of geology. By\r\ncomparing living and fossil animals, Cuvier showed that huger creatures\r\nhad lived on the earth and become extinct before the creation of man. In\r\nthe first epoch he found great reptiles, like the Ichthyosaurus, thirty\r\nfeet long, and the Megalosaurus, seventy feet long. In the second epoch,\r\nhe found the Paleotherium; in the third, the Mammoth, Mastodon, and\r\ngigantic sloth; and in the fourth epoch, man. So closely had he studied\r\nthe relations of the organs of animals, that he could reconstruct the\r\nextinct fossil from a single bone. He had already prepared, at the\r\nrequest of Napoleon, a brilliant \"Report on the Progress of Natural\r\nSciences from the year 1789.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1813, though a Protestant, he was sent to Rome to organize a\r\nuniversity, and was made Master of Requests in the Council of State.\r\nNapoleon also appointed him Commissaire Imperial Extraordinaire, and\r\nsent him to endeavor to raise the people on the left bank of the Rhine\r\nin favor of France, against the invading troops then marching upon\r\nthem. But Cuvier was stopped at Nancy by the entrance of the allied\r\narmies, and obliged to return.\r\n\r\nHe was now famous, and his company and counsel were sought by the\r\nlearned and the great. And he was still a comparatively young man,\r\nforty-four.\r\n\r\nBut life had great sorrows in the midst of this prosperity. His first\r\nchild, a son, had died a few weeks after his birth. His daughter Annie\r\nhad died in 1812, at the age of four, and now in 1813, while he was\r\nabsent in Rome, his only son, Georges, a boy of seven, had been taken\r\nfrom him. The blow was a terrible one. For many years he never saw a boy\r\nnear that age, without being deeply affected. He would stop on the\r\nstreets to watch a group of boys playing, and then go on sadly, thinking\r\nof the one he had buried.\r\n\r\nIn 1814, Cuvier was raised to the rank of Counsellor of State, and\r\nChancellor of the University. When Napoleon was asked why he had\r\nappointed a savant to a political position, he replied, \"that he may be\r\nable to rest himself sometimes,\" knowing that to a man like Cuvier\r\nchange was the most helpful rest. When Napoleon abdicated his throne,\r\nand Louis XVIII. came to power, Cuvier was retained in office, for his\r\nrare administrative ability, and upright life.\r\n\r\nThree years later, the first edition of his \"Animal Kingdom\" appeared,\r\nand is now to be seen in the British Museum, in seventeen volumes. This\r\nwork has served as the basis for subsequent zooelogical classification.\r\nCuvier studied minutely the interior structure of animals, and based his\r\nclassification on this, instead of exterior resemblance.\r\n\r\nAfter this great work was published, Cuvier went with his family to\r\nLondon, for a rest of six weeks. Here he received distinguished\r\nattention from Sir William Herschel, and other learned men.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, he was appointed President of the Committee of the Interior,\r\nand in this position, which he held for life, it is believed ten\r\nthousand various matters passed through his hands each year, for his\r\nexamination and decision. He officiated at the crowning of Charles X.,\r\nas one of the presidents of the Council of State, and received from that\r\nmonarch the decoration of Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor. His\r\nformer sovereign, the King of Wuertemberg, appointed him Commander of the\r\nOrder of the Crown.\r\n\r\nAll this time in which he was doing earnest and responsible work for his\r\ncountry, he was writing and lecturing almost constantly. So careful was\r\nhe of his time, that he always read or wrote as he was riding in his\r\ncarriage through the streets of Paris. A lamp in the back of his\r\ncarriage he used at night, till he found that he was injuring his eyes.\r\nEven while he was sitting for a portrait, to be used as a frontispiece\r\nfor his book, \"Discourse on the Revolutions of the Globe,\" his wife's\r\ndaughter read to him the \"Fortunes of Nigel.\" In the evenings, when he\r\nwas too tired for scientific research, his wife or daughter read to him\r\ngeneral literature.\r\n\r\nEvery Saturday evening a reception was held at the home of Baron Cuvier,\r\nand there one was sure to meet the most brilliant and learned from all\r\nparts of Europe, whether rich or poor....\r\n\r\nCuvier delighted everybody by his courtesy and his cordiality. Another\r\nperson also was the life of these gatherings,--his beautiful daughter\r\nClementine, his only remaining child. Never strong in body, she had been\r\nreared with the tenderest care. Devoted to all good work, reading to\r\naged women, visiting the poor, educated, and of extreme loveliness of\r\ncharacter, she was the idol of her family and of society. On the 25th of\r\nAugust, 1828, she was to have been married, but, while in the midst of\r\nthe preparations, she fell ill of consumption, and died the following\r\nmonth, September 28.\r\n\r\nThe effect on both parents was crushing. Cuvier's light hair grew white,\r\nand lines gathered in his face. After two months he took his place again\r\nat the head of the Committee of the Interior. He listened attentively to\r\nall the discussions, but when it came his turn to speak, he burst into\r\ntears, and covered his bowed face in his hands, and sobbed bitterly.\r\nFinally he raised his head and said, \"Pardon me, gentlemen, I was a\r\nfather, and I have lost all!\" and then with a violent effort he resumed\r\nthe business of the day, with his usual calmness.\r\n\r\nHe devoted himself now more than ever to his books, as though he must\r\nuse every moment, or be prostrated with grief. This same year, 1828, the\r\nfirst book in a series of twenty volumes, beautifully illustrated,\r\nappeared, on the \"Natural History of Fishes, containing more than five\r\nthousand species of those animals, described after nature, and\r\ndistributed according to their affinities, with observations on their\r\nanatomy, and critical researches on their nomenclature, ancient as well\r\nas modern.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1832, he was created a Peer of France, by Louis Philippe. Every honor\r\nhad come that could be asked or desired. His books were eagerly read;\r\ncrowds attended his lectures; he was loved, honored, and revered; but\r\ndeath had robbed him of the sweetest things in life.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, May 8, 1832, he lectured as usual before the College de\r\nFrance, on the \"History and Progress of Science in all Ages.\" In the\r\nevening he felt a numbness in his right arm. It was the beginning of the\r\nend. Paralysis soon developed.\r\n\r\nHe said to M. Pasquier, President of the Chamber of Peers, \"Behold a\r\nvery different person to the man of Tuesday--of Saturday. Nevertheless,\r\nI had great things still to do. All was ready in my head; after thirty\r\nyears of labor and research, there remained but to write; and now the\r\nhands fail, and carry with them the head.\"\r\n\r\nM. Pasquier tenderly expressed the universal interest felt for M.\r\nCuvier. \"I like to think so,\" said the dying man; \"I have long labored\r\nto render myself worthy of it.\" He is to be pitied, indeed, who does\r\nnot care whether the world loves him.\r\n\r\nOn May 13, the nomination of Cuvier to the presidency of the whole\r\nCouncil of State was taken to the sovereign for his signature, but it\r\ncame too late. Cuvier died that day. Four hours before his death he had\r\nasked to be taken into the room where he had met and talked with so many\r\nof the renowned of earth, and where his Clementine had charmed them by\r\nher presence. And there he died.\r\n\r\nHe was buried in Pere la Chaise, by his own request, under the tombstone\r\nwhich covered Clementine, and whose death had virtually caused his own.\r\nHis coffin was borne by the pupils of the different colleges in which he\r\nhad taught, thousands following it to the cemetery. His library of\r\nnineteen thousand volumes was purchased by the government for the Jardin\r\ndes Plantes. There was no child left to bear his titles.\r\n\r\nNot only do the books of such a man live; his whole life, with its\r\nuntiring energy, its promptness, its order, its unfaltering purpose,\r\nits high aims, as well as its tenderness and nobility of heart, is a\r\nconstant inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM AND CAROLINE HERSCHEL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Hanover, Germany, in the year 1732, Isaac Herschel and a plain,\r\nindustrious girl, Anna Ilse Moritzen, began their home life together.\r\nThe young man did not like the calling of his father, the cultivating of\r\nthe royal gardens, and learned to play the oboe in the royal band.\r\n\r\nHe became skilled in music, and, as, one after another, ten children\r\nwere born into the little home, he taught them to play on the violin and\r\noboe, and such other branches of knowledge as he possessed. After a time\r\nhis health became impaired with exposure in the Seven Years' War, and\r\nthen he earned his living by lessons in music, given to scholars at his\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe children attended the garrison school in Hanover, and learned the\r\nordinary rudiments, besides French and German. Though the father\r\nsometimes copied music half the night to eke out his scanty living, he\r\nspared no pains to teach them all he could of his favorite art.\r\n\r\nThe fourth son, William, born November 15, 1738, not only learned French\r\nand English rapidly, but studied Latin and arithmetic with the teacher,\r\nafter hours. He became passionately fond of books, reading their own\r\nlittle store with avidity. The mother, who could not even write, viewed\r\nwith alarm this intellectual development, feeling that her children, if\r\nthey became learned, would go away from home--possibly from Germany.\r\nPoor, ignorant heart! She cooked and sewed, and prevented her daughters\r\nfrom learning French or drawing; but her weak hand could not stay the\r\npower of a mind like William's, bent on acquiring knowledge.\r\n\r\nCaroline, the eighth child, born in 1750, twelve years younger than\r\nWilliam, looked upon this brother as a marvel; and shy, plain, and\r\nsilent herself, watched the boy with pride, who, perchance, would be\r\nsomebody by and by. Alexander, a little older than Caroline, was skilled\r\non the violoncello, and both the boys became members of the Hanover foot\r\nguards.\r\n\r\nYears later, Caroline gave this picture of that early life: \"My brothers\r\nwere often introduced as solo performers and assistants in the orchestra\r\nof the court, and I remember that I was frequently prevented from going\r\nto sleep by the lively criticism on music, on coming from a concert; or\r\nby conversations on philosophical subjects, which lasted frequently till\r\nmorning, in which my father was a lively partaker and assistant of my\r\nbrother William, by contriving self-made instruments....\r\n\r\n\"Often I would keep myself awake that I might listen to their animating\r\nremarks, for it made _me so happy to see them so happy_. But generally\r\ntheir conversation would branch out on philosophical subjects, when my\r\nbrother William and my father often argued with such warmth that my\r\nmother's interference became necessary; when the names Leibnitz, Newton,\r\nand Euler sounded rather too loud for the repose of her little ones, who\r\nought to be in school by seven in the morning. But it seems that on the\r\nbrothers retiring to their own room, where they shared the same bed, my\r\nbrother William had still a great deal to say; and frequently it\r\nhappened that when he stopped for an assent or reply, he found his\r\nhearer was gone to sleep, and I suppose it was not till then that he\r\nbethought himself to do the same.\r\n\r\n\"The recollection of these happy scenes confirms me in the belief, that\r\nhad my brother William not then been interrupted in his philosophical\r\npursuits, we should have had much earlier proofs of his inventive\r\ngenius. My father was a great admirer of astronomy, and had some\r\nknowledge of that science; for I remember his taking me, on a clear\r\nfrosty night, into the street, to make me acquainted with several of the\r\nmost beautiful constellations, after we had been gazing at a comet which\r\nwas then visible. And I well remember with what delight he used to\r\nassist my brother William in his various contrivances in the pursuit of\r\nhis philosophical studies, among which was a neatly turned four-inch\r\nglobe, upon which the equator and ecliptic were engraved by my\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\nWhen William was seventeen, the guards went to England for a year, and\r\non their return home he brought one precious memento of the country,\r\nLocke \"On the Human Understanding.\" Such a boy would not remain in the\r\nfoot guards forever. He was delicate in health, so that his parents\r\nremoved him from the army.\r\n\r\nAt nineteen, he determined to try his fortune in England. He said\r\ngood-by to the culture-loving and warm-hearted father, to the poor\r\nmother who knew \"no other wants than good linen and clothing,\" and\r\nstarted out to make his way in the world. For three years nothing is\r\nknown of him, save that he passed through many hardships. He played in\r\nmilitary bands whenever and wherever he could find a situation, or at\r\nconcerts, and led probably a cramped and obscure life.\r\n\r\nThere was little prospect then that he would become, as Prof. Edward S.\r\nHolden says in his admirable life, \"the greatest of practical\r\nastronomers, and one of the world's most profound philosophers.\" What\r\nthe poor German youth thought and felt in those years of trial, we do\r\nnot know. He had one resource in his loneliness, the reading of useful\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nAfter about three years, a fortuitous circumstance occurred. It proved\r\n\"fortuitous\" only because young Herschel had studied music faithfully,\r\nand had made himself ready to fill a fine position, if, poor and without\r\ninfluence, such a position could be obtained.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Miller, a noted organist, \"was dining at Pontefract with the\r\nofficers of the Durham militia, one of them, knowing his love of music,\r\ntold him they had a young German in their band, as a performer on the\r\noboe, who was also an excellent performer on the violin. The officer\r\nadded that if Miller would come into another room, this German should\r\nentertain him with a solo. The invitation was gladly accepted, and\r\nMiller heard a solo of Giardini's executed in a manner that surprised\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"He afterwards took an opportunity of having some private conversation\r\nwith the young musician, and asked him whether he had engaged himself\r\nfor any long period to the Durham militia. The answer was, 'Only from\r\nmonth to month.'\r\n\r\n\"'Leave them, then,' said the organist, 'and come and live with me. I am\r\na single man, and think we shall be happy together; and doubtless your\r\nmerit will soon entitle you to a more eligible situation.'\r\n\r\n\"The offer was accepted as frankly as it was made, and the reader may\r\nimagine with what satisfaction Dr. Miller must have remembered this act\r\nof generous feeling, when he heard that this young German was Herschel,\r\nthe astronomer. 'My humble mansion,' says Miller, 'consisted at that\r\ntime but of two rooms. However, poor as I was, my cottage contained a\r\nlibrary of well chosen books.'\r\n\r\n\"He took an early opportunity of introducing his new friend at Mr.\r\nCropley's concerts. The first violin was resigned to him, 'and never,'\r\nsays the organist, 'had I heard the concertos of Corelli, Geminiani, and\r\nAvison, or the overtures of Handel, performed more chastely, or more\r\naccording to the original intention of the composers, than by Mr.\r\nHerschel.'\r\n\r\n\"'I soon lost my companion; his fame was presently spread abroad; he had\r\nthe offer of pupils, and was solicited to lead the public concerts both\r\nat Wakefield and Halifax. A new organ for the parish church of Halifax\r\nwas built about this time, and Herschel was one of the seven candidates\r\nfor the organist's place. They drew lots how they were to perform in\r\nsuccession. Herschel drew the third; the second fell to Dr. Wainwright,\r\nof Manchester, whose finger was so rapid that old Snetzler, the\r\norgan-builder, ran about the church exclaiming, \"_He run over te keys\r\nlike one cat; he will not give my piphes room for to shpeak_.\"\r\n\r\n\"'During Mr. Wainwright's performance,' says Miller, 'I was standing in\r\nthe middle aisle with Herschel. \"What chance have you,\" said I, \"to\r\nfollow this man?\" He replied, \"I don't know, I am sure fingers will not\r\ndo.\" On which he ascended the organ loft, and produced from the organ so\r\nuncommon a fulness, such a volume of slow, solemn harmony, that I could\r\nby no means account for the effect. After this short _extempore_\r\neffusion, he finished with the Old Hundredth psalm-tune, which he played\r\nbetter than his opponent.\r\n\r\n\"'\"_Ay, ay,_\" cried old Snetzler, \"_tish is very goot, very goot inteet.\r\nI will hef tish man, for he gives my piphes room for to shpeak._\" Having\r\nafterwards asked Mr. Herschel by what means, in the beginning of his\r\nperformance, he produced so uncommon an effect, he replied, \"I told you\r\nfingers would not do!\" and, producing two pieces of lead from his\r\nwaistcoat pocket, \"One of these,\" said he, \"I placed on the lowest\r\nkey of the organ, and the other upon the octave above; thus, by\r\naccommodating the harmony, I produced the effect of four hands, instead\r\nof two.\"'\"\r\n\r\nHerschel was the successful candidate among the seven. He was now\r\ntwenty-seven years old. Only once do we learn of his going home to\r\nGermany, and that in the year previous. Of this visit, Caroline, now\r\ngrown to fourteen, says, \"Of the joys and pleasures which all felt at\r\nthis long-wished-for meeting with my, let me say my _dearest_ brother,\r\nbut a small portion could fall to my share; for with my constant\r\nattendance at church and school, besides the time I was employed in\r\ndoing the drudgery of the scullery, it was but seldom I could make one\r\nin the group when the family were assembled together.\r\n\r\n\"In the first week, some of the orchestra were invited to a concert, at\r\nwhich some of my brother William's compositions--overtures, etc.--and\r\nsome of my eldest brother, Jacob's, were performed, to the great delight\r\nof my dear father, who hoped and expected that they would be turned to\r\nsome profit by publishing them, but there was no printer who bid high\r\nenough.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a year at Halifax, Herschel obtained a position as organist at the\r\nOctagon Chapel in Bath, a fashionable city of England. This was another\r\nand higher step on the road to fame. He now gave nearly forty lessons a\r\nweek to pupils. He composed music, and wrote anthems, chants, and\r\npsalm-tunes for the cathedral choir where he played. He became so\r\npopular from his real ability, coupled with pleasing manners, that he\r\nwas occupied in teaching from fourteen to sixteen hours daily.\r\n\r\nBut he did more than this. As his hopes brightened, he determined to\r\ndevote every minute to the pursuit of knowledge, in which he found his\r\ngreatest happiness. He studied Greek and Italian. He would _unbend his\r\nmind_, after he retired, with Maclaurin's \"Fluxions,\" or Robert Smith's\r\n\"Complete System of Optics,\" and Lalande's Astronomy.\r\n\r\nWhat if he had devoted this time to ease or amusement! Would he have\r\nbecome learned or distinguished? Every young man and woman is obliged to\r\ndecide the matter for himself and herself. We cannot idle away life and\r\nbe great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAROLINE HERSCHEL.]\r\n\r\nIn 1767, the fond father, Isaac, died of paralysis. Caroline, who loved\r\nhim tenderly, was desolate. He had taught her the violin when the\r\nprosaic mother \"was either in good humor, or out of the way.\" It is\r\nquite possible that music, like inventions, did not bring an adequate\r\nsupport for ten children, and that the practical mother wished her\r\ndaughter to learn something whereby she could earn a living. She\r\nthereupon sent her two or three months to a seamstress to be taught to\r\nmake household linen. After a time a delightful proposition came from\r\nthe organist at Bath. He would take her to England, and see if she\r\n\"could not become a useful singer for his winter concerts and\r\noratorios.\" If she did not succeed, after two years, he would carry her\r\nback to Germany.\r\n\r\nIn 1772, William came to Hanover and took his sister to Bath, at 7 New\r\nKings Street. She was now twenty-two; an untutored girl, with a bright,\r\neager mind, and a heart that went out to her brother in the most rapt\r\ndevotion. History does not show a more complete, single-hearted,\r\nsubservient affection, nor a sadder picture of a woman's sorrow in later\r\nyears, in consequence of it.\r\n\r\nAt once Caroline began her work of voice culture, lessons in arithmetic,\r\nEnglish, and in keeping accounts, from her brother, and in managing the\r\nhouse. Alexander, now in England, boarded with William, and he and\r\nCaroline occupied the attic. The first three winter months were lonely,\r\nas she saw little of William.\r\n\r\n\"The time,\" she says, \"when I could hope to receive a little more of my\r\nbrother's instruction and attention was now drawing near; for after\r\nEaster, Bath becomes very empty, only a few of his scholars, whose\r\nfamilies were residents in the neighborhood, remaining. But I was\r\ngreatly disappointed, for, in consequence of the harassing and\r\nfatiguing life he had led during the winter months, he used to retire to\r\nbed with a basin of milk or glass of water, and Smith's Harmonics and\r\nOptics, Ferguson's Astronomy, etc., and so went to sleep buried under\r\nhis favorite authors; and his first thoughts on rising were how to\r\nobtain the instruments for viewing those objects himself of which he had\r\nbeen reading.\r\n\r\n\"There being in one of the shops a two-and-a-half-foot Gregorian\r\ntelescope to be let, it was for some time taken in requisition, and\r\nserved not only for viewing the heavens, but for making experiments on\r\nits construction.... It soon appeared that my brother was not contented\r\nwith knowing what former observers had seen, for he began to contrive a\r\ntelescope eighteen or twenty feet long.... I was much hindered in my\r\nmusical practice by my help being continually wanted in the execution of\r\nthe various contrivances, and I had to amuse myself with making the tube\r\nof pasteboard for the glasses, which were to arrive from London, for at\r\nthat time no optician had settled at Bath. But when all was finished, no\r\none besides my brother could get a glimpse of Jupiter or Saturn, for the\r\ngreat length of the tube would not allow it to be kept in a straight\r\nline. This difficulty, however, was soon removed by substituting tin\r\ntubes.\"\r\n\r\nHerschel had attempted to buy a telescope, but found the price far\r\nbeyond his means. But he was not discouraged. Caroline soon saw \"almost\r\nevery room turned into a work-shop. A cabinet-maker making a tube and\r\nstands of all descriptions in a handsomely furnished drawing-room;\" this\r\ncould be so occupied when the music scholars had left Bath in their\r\nvacation; \"Alex putting up a huge turning machine in a bedroom, for\r\nturning patterns, grinding glasses, and turning eye-pieces, etc.\"\r\n\r\nThe longed-for time to see more of her brother never came to Caroline,\r\nexcept as she finally grew into his life-work, and became his second\r\nself.\r\n\r\nHe had one unalterable purpose, the study of the construction of the\r\nheavens. Nothing ever drew him from it. Nothing ever could draw him. And\r\nherein lay one of the elements of his great power. As an English writer\r\nhas well said: \"So gentle and patient a follower of science under\r\ndifficulties scarcely occurs in the whole circle of biography.\" Yes, he\r\nwas \"gentle and patient,\" but with an untiring and never ending\r\nperseverance. Too poor to buy telescopes, he made them. With no time to\r\nread books during the day, he took the hours from sleep. With little\r\nopportunity for education, he educated himself.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, the music teacher made for himself a five-and-one-half-foot\r\nGregorian telescope; and a year later, a Newtonian, with a\r\nfour-and-a-half-inch aperture, which magnified two hundred and\r\ntwenty-two times. The making of these instruments showed great\r\nmechanical skill and accurate knowledge. He began now to study the\r\nheavens in earnest, but the teaching must go on to provide daily bread.\r\nHe directed an orchestra of nearly one hundred pieces, and Caroline\r\ncopied the scores and vocal parts. So absorbed was he in his\r\nastronomical work, however, that at the theatre, between the acts, he\r\nwould run from the harpsichord to look at the stars. This boyish\r\neagerness and naturalness he kept through life.\r\n\r\nHe soon made a seven-foot reflector, then a ten-foot reflector. The\r\nmirrors for these telescopes were all made by hand, machines for the\r\npurpose not being invented till ten or more years later. Alexander, with\r\nhis mechanical skill, assisted, and Caroline was always busy at the\r\nwork. She says, \"My time was taken up with copying music and practising,\r\nbesides attendance on my brother when polishing; since, by way of\r\nkeeping him alive, I was constantly obliged to feed him, by putting his\r\nvictuals by bits into his mouth. This was once the case, when, in order\r\nto finish a seven-foot mirror, he had not taken his hands from it for\r\nsixteen hours together. In general he was never unemployed at meals, but\r\nwas always at those times contriving or making drawings of whatever came\r\nin his mind. Generally I was obliged to read to him while he was at the\r\nturning-lathe, or polishing mirrors, 'Don Quixote,' 'Arabian Nights'\r\nEntertainment,' the novels of Sterne, Fielding, etc.; serving tea and\r\nsupper without interrupting the work with which he was engaged.\"...\r\n\r\nSo busy that he could not find time to eat or sleep! Rare devotion of a\r\nrare mind! He now began to study every star of the first, second, third,\r\nand fourth magnitudes in the sky. He carefully observed the moon, and\r\nmeasured the height of about one hundred of her mountains. Her extinct\r\nvolcanoes, and her unpeopled solitudes, without clouds or air, were an\r\nimpressive study.\r\n\r\nHe was now forty years old,--not young to begin the study of a new and\r\nillimitable science, but not too old, for one is never too old to begin\r\na great or a noble work.\r\n\r\nThrough Dr. William Watson, Fellow of the Royal Society, who\r\nhappened--if anything ever _happens_ in this world--to see Herschel at\r\nhis telescope, he became a member of the Philosophical Society of Bath,\r\nand soon in 1780 sent two papers to the Royal Society, the one on the\r\nperiodical star in _Collo Ceti_, and the other on the mountains of the\r\nmoon, which were read by Dr. William Watson, Jr.\r\n\r\nWhen he was forty-three, he says, \"I began to construct a thirty-foot\r\naerial reflector, and, having made a stand for it, I cast the mirror\r\nthirty-six inches in diameter. This was cracked in cooling. I cast it a\r\nsecond time, and the furnace I had built in my house broke.\" But he\r\npersevered. This same year, 1781, after he had lived in Bath nine years,\r\non the night of Tuesday, March 13, having removed to a larger house, 19\r\nNew King Street, he says, \"In examining the small stars in the\r\nneighborhood of _H. Geminorum_ I perceived one that appeared visibly\r\nlarger than the rest; being struck with its uncommon appearance, I\r\ncompared it to _H. Geminorum_ and the small star in the quarter between\r\nAuriga and Gemini, and, finding it so much larger than either of them, I\r\nsuspected it to be a comet.\"\r\n\r\nThe orbit of this \"comet\" was computed and its distance from the sun\r\nfound to be eighteen hundred million miles! The world soon awoke to the\r\nfact that a new planet had been found, the greatest astronomical\r\ndiscovery since Galileo invented the telescope, and the unknown musician\r\nat Bath had become famous! So little was Herschel known at this time,\r\nthat one journal called him Mersthel, another Herthel, and still another\r\nHermstel.\r\n\r\nIn December of the same year, 1781, Herschel was elected a Fellow of the\r\nRoyal Society and received the Copley gold medal. He was no longer the\r\npoor German youth playing the oboe among the guards; he was the renowned\r\ndiscoverer. He called the planet Georgium Sidus, in honor of his\r\nsovereign, George III., but it was decided later to call it Uranus, from\r\nUrania the muse of astronomy.\r\n\r\nHerschel went eagerly on with his work. Fame did not change his simple\r\nnature. The truly great are never ostentatious. He erected in his garden\r\na stand for his twenty-foot telescope, and perfected his mirrors.\r\n\"Though at times,\" says Caroline, \"much harassed with business, the\r\nmirror for the thirty-foot reflector was never out of his mind, and if\r\na minute could but be spared in going from one scholar to another, or\r\ngiving one the slip, he called at home to see how the men went on with\r\nthe furnace, which was built in a room below, even with the garden.\"\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1782, Herschel went to London, and met with a gracious\r\nreception from George III. He wrote back to his devoted sister: \"Dear\r\nLina: All my papers are printing, with the postscript and all, and are\r\nallowed to be very valuable. You see, Lina, I tell you all these things.\r\nYou know vanity is not my foible, therefore I need not fear your\r\ncensure. Farewell.\r\n\r\n                                \"I am your affectionate brother,\r\n                                                     \"WM. HERSCHEL.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he wrote,--\r\n\r\n\"I pass my time between Greenwich and London, agreeably enough, but am\r\nrather at a loss for work that I like. Company is not always pleasing,\r\nand I would much rather be polishing a speculum.... I am introduced to\r\nthe best company. To-morrow I dine at Lord Palmerston's, next day with\r\nSir Joseph Banks, etc., etc. Among opticians and astronomers nothing now\r\nis talked of but _what they call_ my great discoveries. Alas! this shows\r\nhow far they are behind, when such trifles as I have seen and done are\r\ncalled _great_. Let me but get at it again! I will make such telescopes,\r\nand see such things--that is, I will endeavor to do so.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this great ambition nerved him for action, continued and laborious,\r\nas long as he lived. He was never satisfied; always achieving. Little\r\ncan be expected from those who are easily satisfied.\r\n\r\nGeorge III. wisely appointed Herschel Royal Astronomer, though with the\r\ntoo small salary of one thousand dollars yearly. He came back to Bath\r\nonly to perform the last musical duty on Whit Sunday, 1782, the anthem\r\nfor the day being his own composition, and to say good-by to his pupils.\r\n\r\nHe moved to Datchet in 1782, and set up his twenty-foot telescope. In\r\n1783 he had made three reviews of the heavens. In 1784 he made a fourth\r\nreview with his twenty-foot telescope. Caroline says: \"My brother began\r\nhis sweeps when the instrument was yet in a very unfinished state, and\r\nmy feelings were not very comfortable when every moment I was alarmed by\r\na crash or a fall, knowing him to be elevated fifteen feet or more on a\r\ntemporary crossbeam, instead of a safe gallery. The ladders had not even\r\ntheir braces at the bottom; and one night, in a very high wind, he had\r\nhardly touched the ground before the whole apparatus came down.... I\r\ncould give a pretty long list of accidents which were near proving fatal\r\nto my brother as well as myself.\"\r\n\r\nA gentleman who visited him at Datchet wrote: \"The thermometer in the\r\ngarden stood at 13 deg. Fahrenheit; but in spite of this, Herschel observes\r\nthe whole night through, except that he stops every three or four hours\r\nand goes in the room for a few moments. For some years Herschel has\r\nobserved the heavens every hour when the weather is clear, and this\r\nalways in the open air, because he says that the telescope only performs\r\nwell when it is at the same temperature as the air. He protects himself\r\nagainst the weather by putting on more clothing. He has an excellent\r\nconstitution, and thinks about nothing else in the world but the\r\ncelestial bodies.\"\r\n\r\nBut, occupied as Herschel was about \"celestial bodies,\" he yet found\r\ntime to think about earthly things, for we find him at forty-five, May\r\n8, 1783, marrying Mary, the wealthy widow of John Pitt, Esq., a lady of\r\nmuch intelligence and amiability.\r\n\r\nThe sad feature of the new relationship was the misery it brought to\r\nCaroline. Her whole life had centred in William. For eleven years she\r\nhad devoted every moment, every wish, every thought to him. She had\r\nwatched all night among the stars with him, month after month, and year\r\nafter year, in cold and in heat, and superintended his home by day. His\r\nevery desire was her law. She loved no other, and he was her all.\r\nPerhaps she ought to have known that another might come into his life,\r\nbut she trusted blindly, and did not question the future.\r\n\r\nWhen the wife came into the home, Caroline went out of it forever. For\r\nmore than twenty years she lived in lodgings, always \"cheerless and\r\nsolitary,\" her only happiness found in coming day by day to help her\r\nbrother in his great work. Sometimes, when the wife was absent, Caroline\r\ncame back for a few days and lived over the old unalloyed life, and then\r\nwent back to her lonely lodgings.\r\n\r\nFor ten years following this marriage, she probably told her heart-aches\r\nin her journal; but before her death she destroyed the record of these\r\nyears, that the feelings of those who were alive might not be pained. In\r\nlater days she became more reconciled to Lady Herschel, as \"a dear\r\nsister, for as such I now know you,\" and idolized their only son, the\r\nrenowned Sir John Herschel, born nine years after their marriage.\r\n\r\nIn 1785, Herschel began to construct his great forty-foot telescope, and\r\nthe next year removed to Slough, not far from Windsor. \"In the whole of\r\nthe apparatus,\" he said, \"none but common workmen were employed, for I\r\nmade drawings of every part of it, by which it was easy to execute the\r\nwork, as I constantly inspected and directed every person's labor;\r\nthough sometimes there were not less than forty different workmen\r\nemployed at the same time. While the stand of the telescope was\r\npreparing, I also began the construction of the great mirror, of which I\r\ninspected the casting, grinding, and polishing; and the work was in this\r\nmanner carried on with no other interruption than that occasioned by the\r\nremoval of all the apparatus and materials from where I then lived, to\r\nmy present situation at Slough.\" He had his first view through the\r\ntelescope February 19, 1787. George III. gave twenty thousand dollars\r\nfor the building of this instrument, and one thousand dollars yearly for\r\nits maintenance.\r\n\r\nA half-century afterwards, the woodwork having become decayed, it was\r\ntaken down, the great tube laid horizontally, and, after Sir John\r\nHerschel and his family had passed through it, a poem written by Sir\r\nJohn having been read, it was sealed January 1, 1840, and placed on\r\npiers.\r\n\r\nWith this great telescope, Herschel discovered two satellites of Saturn,\r\nMimas and Enceladus; one on August 27, 1789, and the other on September\r\n17 of the same year. Two years before this, January 11, 1787, he\r\ndiscovered two satellites of Uranus, Oberon and Titania. Sixty years\r\nafterwards, Mr. Lassell, of England, discovered the remaining two\r\nsatellites of Uranus, called Ariel and Umbriel.\r\n\r\nFrom this time his work went forward grandly. He had already completed\r\nmore than two hundred seven-foot, one hundred and fifty ten-foot, and\r\neighty twenty-foot mirrors. For many of the telescopes sent abroad he\r\nmade no stands, but provided the drawings. He wrote much about Saturn\r\nand its rings, and showed that its most distant satellite, Japetus,\r\nturns once on its axis in each revolution about its primary, as our moon\r\ndoes about the earth.\r\n\r\nHe studied carefully the nature of the sun, its probable gaseous\r\nsurface, and its spots, and was the first to suspect their periodic\r\ncharacter. What would Herschel have said to the wonderful photographic\r\nrepresentations of these spots given by Professor Langley, in his New\r\nAstronomy; spots which are one billion square miles in size; more than\r\nfive times the surface of the land and water on the earth? He saw, as\r\nastronomers to-day see, that heat cannot be produced without expenditure\r\nof force; and that the sun is probably cooling, even though scarcely\r\nperceptibly for ages to come. He saw what science now generally\r\nconcedes, the rise and fall of the solar system; its gradual fitness for\r\nthe coming of man, through almost countless centuries; and its final\r\nunfitness, when his generations shall have gone forever.\r\n\r\nHe wrote much about the Milky Way, believing at first that it could be\r\ncompletely resolved into stars, about eighteen millions of them; but\r\nlater he changed his theory, having found so much nebulous matter--in a\r\nstate of condensation as though new worlds were forming, possibly to be\r\nthe homes of some new race, or of man in the ages to come.\r\n\r\nHis study of the variable stars attracted wide attention. He found that\r\nthe star _Mira Ceti_ was for several months invisible to the naked eye;\r\nthen it grew brighter and brighter, and finally disappeared for months,\r\nas before. He saw that other stars are periodic, and came to the\r\nconclusion that this is occasioned by the rotation of the star upon its\r\naxis, by which different parts of its surface are presented to us\r\nperiodically.\r\n\r\nHe made a catalogue of double stars, and found by laborious calculations\r\nthat such stars have a common centre of gravity; that one sun revolves\r\nabout another. He found that our solar system has a motion of its own; a\r\ngrand orbit round some as yet unknown centre, and that other systems\r\nhave a like motion.\r\n\r\nWhat this centre may be, whether a great sun like Sirius, one hundred\r\ntimes larger than ours, with unknown powers and unknown uses, is of\r\ncourse only conjecture.\r\n\r\nHerschel gave much attention to nebulae, discovering and describing\r\ntwenty-five hundred new nebulae and clusters. He gave his life to the\r\nstudy of the construction of the heavens. Concerning his statement of\r\nthe general construction, Professor Holden, himself a brilliant\r\nastronomer, says: \"It is the groundwork upon which we have still to\r\nbuild.... As a scientific conception it is perhaps the grandest that has\r\never entered into the human mind. As a study of the height to which the\r\nefforts of one man may go, it is almost without a parallel.... As a\r\npractical astronomer he remains without an equal. In profound philosophy\r\nhe has few superiors. By a kindly chance he can be claimed as the\r\ncitizen of no one country. In very truth his is one of the few names\r\nwhich belong to the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nThe distinguished man, though unassuming and gentle in manner, must have\r\nhad a realizing sense of the greatness of his work, for he said, \"I\r\nhave looked further into space than ever human being did before me. I\r\nhave observed stars of which the light takes _two millions_ of years to\r\ntravel to this globe.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave much study to light and heat. So boundless was his knowledge\r\nbelieved to be, that a farmer called one day to ask the proper time for\r\ncutting his grass.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that field,\" said the scientist, \"and when I tell you it is\r\nmine, I think you will not need another proof to convince you that I am\r\nno more weatherwise than yourself or the rest of my neighbors.\"\r\n\r\nHe worked earnestly till he was seventy-six, always depending upon his\r\nfaithful and inseparable Caroline for aid in his labors. He made a\r\ntelescope for her, with which she swept the heavens for comets, finding\r\neight, five of which she discovered for the first time.\r\n\r\nAt seventy-six his health began to fail. He had worked incessantly from\r\nhis struggling boyhood, but brain work does not wear us out; care and\r\nanxiety bring the marks of age upon us. He now took little journeys away\r\nfrom Slough for change of scene and air, while Caroline stayed at home\r\nto copy his papers for the Royal Society, and to arrange his\r\nmanuscripts. In 1816, he was made a knight of the Royal Hanoverian\r\nGuelphic Order, by the Prince Regent, and in 1821 was the first\r\npresident of the Royal Astronomical Society, his son being its first\r\nforeign secretary.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1818, Caroline spent twelve precious days with her brother,\r\n\"not in idleness,\" she says, \"but in sorrow and sadness. He is not only\r\nunwell, but low in spirits.\" Later he went to Bath with Lady Herschel.\r\n\"The last moments before he stepped into the carriage,\" says the loving\r\nCaroline, \"were spent in walking with me through his library and\r\nworkrooms, pointing with anxious looks to every shelf and drawer,\r\ndesiring me to examine all and to make memorandums of them as well as I\r\ncould. He was hardly able to support himself, and his spirits were so\r\nlow, that I found difficulty in commanding my voice so far as to give\r\nhim the assurance he should find on his return that my time had not been\r\nmisspent.\r\n\r\n\"When I was left alone I found that I had no easy task to perform, for\r\nthere were packets of writings to be examined which had not been looked\r\nat for the last forty years. But I did not pass a single day without\r\nworking in the library as long as I could read a letter without\r\ncandle-light, and taking with me papers to copy, etc., which employed me\r\nfor the _best part of the night_, and thus I was enabled to give my\r\nbrother a clear account of what had been done at his return.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July, 1819, Herschel sent a note to his dear co-worker.\r\n\"Lina,--There is a great comet. I want you to assist me. Come to dine\r\nand spend the day here. If you can come soon after one o'clock we shall\r\nhave time to prepare maps and telescopes. I saw its situation last\r\nnight,--it has a long tail.\"\r\n\r\nCaroline wrote on this small slip of yellow paper: \"I keep this as a\r\nrelic! Every line _now_ traced by the hand of my dear brother becomes a\r\ntreasure to me.\"\r\n\r\nEvery day hereafter she spent the forenoon with Sir William. On the 15th\r\nof August she went as usual and found that he was confined to his room.\r\n\"I flew there immediately,\" she says. \"As soon as he saw me, I was sent\r\nto the library to fetch one of his last papers and a plate of the\r\nforty-foot telescope. But for the universe I could not have looked twice\r\nat what I had snatched from the shelf, and when he faintly asked if the\r\nbreaking up of the Milky Way was in it, I said 'Yes!' and he looked\r\ncontent. I cannot help remembering this circumstance, it was the last\r\ntime I was sent to the library on such an occasion. That the anxious\r\ncare for his papers and workroom never ended but with his life was\r\nproved by his frequent whispered inquiries if they were locked and the\r\nkey safe, of which I took care to assure him that they were, and the key\r\nin Lady Herschel's hands.\r\n\r\n\"After half an hour's vain attempt to support himself, my brother was\r\nobliged to consent to be put to bed, leaving no hope ever to see him\r\nrise again. For ten days and nights we remained in the most\r\nheart-rending situation till the 25th of August, when not one comfort\r\nwas left to me but that of retiring to the chamber of death, there to\r\nruminate without interruption on my isolated situation. Of this last\r\nsolace I was robbed on the 7th of September, when the dear remains were\r\nconsigned to the grave.\"\r\n\r\nFaithful and devoted watcher over his dead body, to the last! When he\r\nhad been buried in the little church at Upton, Windsor, at the age of\r\neighty-four, honored by all Europe and America, Caroline could live no\r\nlonger where remembrance of him made it intolerable.\r\n\r\nShe went back to Hanover, \"a person,\" she said, sadly, \"that has nothing\r\nmore to do in this world,\" to live with her brother Dietrich. She had\r\ncome to England, a girl of twenty-two; she went back an elderly woman,\r\nseventy-two. The home in Germany did not prove a happy one, but how\r\ncould it without William? She lived simply, not spending half of the\r\nfive hundred dollars a year left her by her dead brother.\r\n\r\nShe had already published \"A Catalogue of eight hundred and sixty Stars,\r\nobserved by Flamsteed, but not included in the British Catalogue,\" and\r\n\"A General Index of Reference to every Observation of every star in the\r\nabove mentioned British Catalogue.\" She also prepared \"The Reduction and\r\nArrangement, in the form of a Catalogue in Zones, of all the Star\r\nClusters and Nebulae observed by Sir William Herschel in his Sweeps,\" \"a\r\nwork,\" said Sir David Brewster, \"of immense labor; an extraordinary\r\nmonument of the unextinguished ardor of a lady of seventy-five in the\r\ncause of abstract science.\"\r\n\r\nFor this the Royal Astronomical Society voted her the gold medal, and\r\ngave her the unusual distinction of honorary membership.\r\n\r\nSixteen years after her return to Hanover, Sir John Herschel, her\r\nnephew, who had made his wonderful review of the southern heavens,\r\ndiscovering as many new nebulae as his father, took his only boy, Willie,\r\nto see her.\r\n\r\nShe was now eighty-eight. The visit was overwhelming to her affectionate\r\nheart. She watched the child with the most intense delight. Fearing the\r\nresults if she knew the time of their departure for England, Sir John,\r\nwith mistaken kindness, went away at four o'clock in the morning,\r\nwithout saying good-by. But the anguish of separation was thereby\r\nrendered greater.\r\n\r\nThe years went by slowly. On her ninety-sixth birthday the King of\r\nPrussia sent her a gold medal, Alexander von Humboldt writing her a\r\nletter from Berlin to accompany it.\r\n\r\nJanuary 14, 1848, at the age of almost ninety-eight, Caroline Herschel\r\ndied, and was buried from the same garrison church where nearly a\r\ncentury before she had been christened. In her coffin was placed, by her\r\ndesire, a lock of her brother's hair. Beautiful affection! great\r\nco-workers in their immortal study of unnumbered worlds!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great Agassiz, in his eloquent address, in Boston, on the hundredth\r\nanniversary of the birth of Humboldt, said: \"All the fundamental facts\r\nof popular education in physical science, beyond the merest elementary\r\ninstruction, we owe to him. We are reaping daily in every school\r\nthroughout the broad land, where education is the heritage of the\r\npoorest child, the intellectual harvest sown by him.\r\n\r\n\"There is not a text-book of geography, or a school atlas in the hands\r\nof our children to-day, which does not bear, however blurred and\r\ndefaced, the impress of his great mind. But for him our geographies\r\nwould be mere enumerations of localities and statistics. He first\r\nsuggested the graphic methods of representing natural phenomena which\r\nare now universally adopted. The first geological sections, the first\r\nsections across an entire continent, the first averages of climate\r\nillustrated by lines, were his. Every school-boy is familiar with his\r\nmethods now, but he does not know that Humboldt is his teacher....\"\r\n\r\nNaturally we ask how such a man rose to fame, and what incited him to\r\nstand among the few intellectual leaders of the world.\r\n\r\nFrederick William Henry _Alexander_ von Humboldt was born September 14,\r\n1769, in Berlin, the same year as Baron Cuvier. Unlike Cuvier, he came\r\ninto a home of wealth and culture. His father was a Prussian officer and\r\nchamberlain to the king. His mother, the widow of Baron von Hollwede,\r\nmarried Major von Humboldt when he was forty-six years old, bringing\r\ninto the family much landed property. Three children were born to them,\r\na daughter who died in infancy, and the famous brothers, William and\r\nAlexander, the former two years older than the latter.\r\n\r\nThe father, an exceedingly amiable and benevolent man, died when\r\nAlexander was but ten years old. The mother, left with her two sons, was\r\nwise enough to select superior tutors for them, deeming a good education\r\ntheir best preparation for a useful life.\r\n\r\nMuch of their time was spent at their summer home at Tegel, on the banks\r\nof the Havel, about eight miles from Berlin. In 1778 Goethe went there\r\nfor a visit, and the two Humboldt lads, nine and eleven years of age,\r\nplayed and talked with the leading mind of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe children were not altogether happy there, as Alexander wrote a\r\nfriend years afterward. \"Vine-clad hills which here we call mountains,\r\nextensive plantations of foreign trees, the meadows surrounding the\r\nhouse, and lovely views of the lake with its picturesque banks awaiting\r\nthe beholder at every turn, render this place undoubtedly one of the\r\nmost attractive residences in the neighborhood. If, in addition, you\r\npicture to yourself the high degree of luxury and taste that reigns in\r\nour home, you will indeed be surprised when I tell you that I never\r\nvisit this place without a certain feeling of melancholy.... I passed\r\nmost of that unhappy time (my youthful days) here at Tegel, among people\r\nwho loved me, and showed me kindness, but with whom I had not the least\r\nsympathy, where I was subjected to a thousand restraints and much\r\nself-imposed solitude, and where I was often placed in circumstances\r\nthat obliged me to maintain a close reserve, and to make continual\r\nself-sacrifices.\r\n\r\n\"Now that I am my own master, and living here without restraint, I am\r\nunable to yield myself to the charms of which nature is here so\r\nprodigal, because I am met at every turn by painful recollections of my\r\nchildhood, which even the inanimate objects around me are continually\r\nawakening. Sad as such recollections are, however, they are interesting\r\nfrom the thought that it was just my residence here which exercised so\r\npowerful an influence in the formation of my character and the direction\r\nof my tastes to the study of nature.\"\r\n\r\nMuch which seems trying and unsatisfactory is, after all, our best\r\ndiscipline for life. The strongest and noblest characters are not\r\ndeveloped in the perpetual sunshine of happiness. Rain and sun are alike\r\nnecessary for growth.\r\n\r\nAlexander early showed great fondness for natural history, collecting\r\nflowers, plants, butterflies, shells, and stones, so that he was called\r\nthe \"Little Apothecary.\" He likewise found great delight in drawing. He\r\nsays of himself: \"Until I reached the age of sixteen, I showed little\r\ninclination for scientific pursuits. I was of a restless disposition,\r\nand wished to be a soldier. This choice was displeasing to my family,\r\nwho were desirous that I should devote myself to the study of finance,\r\nso that I had no opportunity of attending a course of botany or\r\nchemistry; I am self-taught in almost all the sciences with which I am\r\nnow so occupied, and I acquired them comparatively late in life. Of the\r\nscience of botany I never so much as heard till I formed the\r\nacquaintance in 1788 of Herr Willdenow, a youth of my own age, who had\r\njust been publishing a Flora of Berlin. His gentle and amiable character\r\nstimulated the interest I felt in his pursuits. I never received any\r\nlessons professedly, but I used to bring him the specimens I collected,\r\nand he gave me their classifications. I became passionately devoted to\r\nbotany, and took especial interest in the study of cryptogamia. The\r\nsight of exotic plants, even when only as dried specimens in an\r\nherbarium, fired my imagination with the pleasure that would be derived\r\nfrom the view of a tropical vegetation in southern lands.\"\r\n\r\nAt sixteen, then, the boy did not know for what he was best fitted in\r\nlife. How important for young men and women to study themselves, and\r\nknow their own tastes and capacities! At nineteen he had never heard of\r\nbotany, and yet he became one of the most distinguished of botanists!\r\n\r\nThe boy also longed to go to sea, not an unusual desire in restless and\r\nambitious natures. But he was frail in body, and gave little evidence\r\nthat he would ever be able to accomplish any of the things for which he\r\nlonged.\r\n\r\nAt nineteen he was ready for college, and with his brother entered at\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Oder. He gave his time largely to finance and political\r\neconomy, by his mother's desire, that he might be able to act in some\r\ncapacity under the government.\r\n\r\nAt college, as ever after in life, he found one devoted friend, who\r\nbecame his inseparable companion. At Frankfort, it was Wegener, a young\r\ntheologian, with a warm heart, and great zeal for knowledge. Nor did\r\nthis friendship cease when he went to Goettingen some months later, for\r\nbetter opportunities in the study of science. He wrote to Wegener: \"If\r\nGod only spare us, nothing can break the bond between two friends who\r\nare to each other more than brothers.... My fervent love and sincere\r\nfriendship for you are as imperishable as the soul which gives them\r\nbirth.... How happy, how inexpressibly happy should I be, if I had a\r\nfriend like you by my side!... I doubt not that among eight hundred men\r\nthere must be some with whom I could form a friendship, but how long is\r\nit often before we find each other out! Were not you and I acquainted\r\nfor three months before we discovered how completely we were made one\r\nfor the other? To be without a friend, what an existence! And where can\r\nI hope to find a friend whom I could place by your side in my\r\naffections!\"\r\n\r\nThese words seem like those of a lover, or an affectionate woman, but\r\nthey come from a mind that now, as in after years, towered like a giant\r\noak in the trees of a forest. Beautiful union of brain and heart! Such\r\nonly makes an ideal character.\r\n\r\nHumboldt had already met Willdenow, and begun to love botany. Again he\r\nwrites to Wegener: \"I have just come in from a solitary walk in the\r\nThiergarten,\"--he was for a short time in Berlin,--\"where I have been\r\nseeking for mosses, lichens, and fungi, which are just now in\r\nperfection. How sad to wander about alone! And yet there is something\r\nattractive in this solitude, when occupied with nature.... I am\r\ncollecting materials for a work on the various properties of plants,\r\nmedicinal properties excepted; it is a work requiring such great\r\nresearch, and such a profound knowledge of botany, as to be far beyond\r\nmy unassisted powers, and I am therefore endeavoring to enlist the\r\ncooeperation of several of my friends.... Pray do not imagine that I am\r\ngoing to appear as an author forthwith; I do not intend that shall\r\nhappen for the next ten years, and by that time I trust I shall have\r\ndiscovered something startlingly new and important.\"\r\n\r\nGoettingen was now at the height of its glory. Humboldt attended courses\r\nof lectures on archaeology, on trade and commerce, on light, heat, and\r\nelectricity, on agriculture, and on ancient tragic poets, under Heyne,\r\nof whom he said, \"Heyne is undoubtedly the man to whom this century is\r\nthe most deeply indebted; to him we owe the spread of religious\r\nenlightenment, by means of the education and training he has instituted\r\nfor young village school-masters; to him is due the introduction of a\r\nmore liberal tone of thought, the establishment of a literary\r\narchaeology, and the first association of the principles of aesthetics\r\nwith the study of philology.\"\r\n\r\nHumboldt was also fond of Greek. He said, \"The more I know of the Greek\r\nlanguage, the more am I confirmed in my preconceived opinion, that it is\r\nthe true foundation for all the higher branches of learning.\"\r\n\r\nWith some friends, he soon founded the Philosophical Society, which,\r\nwith the admirable libraries and museums at hand, became of great\r\nassistance to the students.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1790, he had become so interested in science, that he\r\nwrote Wegener: \"I was away from Goettingen for two months, spending the\r\nvacation in making a scientific tour with a Herr van Genns, a Dutchman\r\nwith whom I became acquainted through his writings on botanical\r\nsubjects.... Amid the numberless distractions of the journey, which was\r\nmade sometimes on foot and sometimes by carriage, and with the incessant\r\noccupation of packing up minerals and plants, I was not very well able\r\nto write to you.\" The result of this tour was a pamphlet, \"Mineralogical\r\nObservations on some Basalts of the Rhine.\" His next works were two\r\nsmall treatises, \"The Aqueous Origin of Basalt,\" and \"The Metallic Seams\r\nin the Basalt at Unkel.\" And this youth of twenty-one was self-taught\r\nboth in mineralogy and geology!\r\n\r\nThe wonder was not so great, perhaps, that a young man of his age should\r\nhave written these sketches, as that, being wealthy and of the best\r\nsocial position, the temptations to ease and enjoyment did not draw him\r\naway from such subjects. Poverty may not be a delight, but the larger\r\npart of the world's work has been done under its stimulus. Wealth should\r\nbe an incentive, because it gives leisure for careful study, but this is\r\nnot always the case.\r\n\r\nAt Goettingen, Humboldt found a friend among the eight hundred. At the\r\nhouse of Heyne he made the acquaintance of George Foster, Heyne's\r\nson-in-law, a man who exerted a remarkable and lasting influence over\r\nhim. Foster was thirty-six; Humboldt, fifteen years his junior. He had\r\nbeen around the world with Captain Cook in his second voyage, and had\r\npublished an able book upon the subject. He was skilled in chemistry,\r\nphilosophy, literature, and politics, understood Latin, Greek, French,\r\nEnglish, Dutch, and Italian, and was somewhat conversant with the\r\nSwedish, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, and Polish languages.\r\n\r\nThe influence of such a man can well be imagined. He became a guiding\r\nstar to the young Goettingen student. If we could but estimate the value\r\nof right friendships in life! We flatter ourselves that we are too\r\nstrong to be influenced, and yet we are greatly influenced for good or\r\nfor evil by those with whom we associate. Humboldt always chose\r\nintellectual friends, and the natural result followed.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1790, he left Goettingen, and, with Foster and Van\r\nGenns, took a journey to the Lower Rhine, Holland, Belgium, England, and\r\nFrance, studying docks, mines, botanic gardens, manufactures, and\r\nchurches, and visiting literary celebrities. Still the new friends did\r\nnot take the place of the old, for he writes to Wegener: \"I beseech you,\r\ndearest Wegener, by all the affection which you know I bear you, never\r\nto forget our brotherly love and friendship. You are infinitely more to\r\nme than I can ever be to you. I have now seen the most celebrated places\r\nin Germany, Holland, and England--but, believe me, I have in seeing them\r\nnever been so happy as while sitting in Steinbart's arm-chair.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of this journey was never lost. Sixty-eight years\r\nafterward, Humboldt said: \"For the space of thirty years I have never\r\nknown leisure but of an evening, and the half-century that I have spent\r\nin this ceaseless activity has been occupied in telling myself and\r\nothers how much I owe my teacher and friend George Foster in the\r\ngeneralization of my views on nature, and in the strengthening and\r\ndevelopment of that which had already dawned in me, before those happy\r\ndays of intimate friendship.\"\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1790, Humboldt went to Hamburg, to enter the\r\nSchool of Commerce. He wished to study political economy further, and to\r\nlearn practical book-keeping. He wrote to a friend: \"I am contented with\r\nmy mode of life at Hamburg, but not happy, less happy even than at\r\nGoettingen, where the monotony of my existence was relieved by the\r\nsociety of one or two friends and the vicinity of some moss-grown\r\nmountains. I am, however, always contented when I feel that I am\r\naccomplishing the purpose I have in view.... My leisure hours are\r\noccupied with geology and botany.... In addition, I have begun to learn\r\nDanish and Swedish.\"\r\n\r\nTo Wegener he writes: \"I have made considerable progress in general\r\ninformation, and I am beginning to be somewhat more satisfied with my\r\nattainments. I worked very hard at Goettingen, but all I have learned\r\nmakes me feel only the more keenly how much remains still to know. My\r\nhealth suffered severely, but improved somewhat during my journey with\r\nFoster; yet even here I continue so closely occupied that I find it\r\ndifficult to spare myself. There is an eager impulse within me, which\r\noften carries me, I fear, beyond the bounds of reason; and yet such\r\nimpetuosity is always necessary to insure success.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"eager impulse\" was a sure indication of something to be\r\naccomplished by and by. Success does not come with half-hearted effort;\r\nit comes only through a force and persistence that will allow no\r\nbarriers between us and the goal.\r\n\r\nAt Easter, 1791, Humboldt left Hamburg and hastened to the famous School\r\nof Mines at Freiberg, to study under the celebrated Werner. Here, as\r\never, he attached one ardent friend to himself, Freiesleben, a student\r\nin geology. Here every moment was occupied. He studied the works of the\r\nFrench chemists; Guyton de Moreau, Fourcroy, Lavoisier, and Berthollet.\r\nHe was daily in the mines, from six o'clock till twelve. He crowded six\r\nlectures into each afternoon. He made a study of the vegetation of that\r\nlower world, from which the sunlight is ever excluded, and the results\r\nwere used later in his comprehensive work, \"Flora Subterranea\r\nFribergensis.\" He wrote articles for several scientific journals. A busy\r\nlife, indeed, for the young man of twenty-two!\r\n\r\nHis friend Freiesleben says of Humboldt at this time:--\r\n\r\n\"The salient points of his attractive character lay in his imperturbable\r\ngood-nature, his benevolence and charity, his remarkable and _unselfish\r\namiability_, his susceptibility of friendship and appreciation of\r\nnature; simplicity, candor, and the absence of all pretension\r\ncharacterized his whole being; he possessed conversational powers that\r\nmade him always lively and entertaining, together with a degree of wit\r\nand humor that led him sometimes to waggishness. It was these admirable\r\nqualities which in later years enabled him to soften and attach to\r\nhimself the untutored savages, among whom he dwelt for months at a time,\r\nwhich obtained for him in the civilized world admiration and sympathy\r\nwherever he went, and which gained for him, while a mere student, the\r\nesteem and devotion of all classes at Freiberg.\r\n\r\n\"He was kindly disposed towards every one, and knew how to make himself\r\nuseful and entertaining in every circle of society; and it was only\r\nagainst every species of inhumanity and coarseness, against every kind\r\nof insolence, injustice, or cruelty, that he ever manifested either\r\nscorn or indignation.\"\r\n\r\nHow the world loves \"unselfish amiability;\" a person who goes through\r\nlife thinking for others, not irritable, not supersensitive, not\r\ncensorious!\r\n\r\nOn Humboldt's return to Berlin in 1792, he was at once made \"Assessor in\r\nthe Administrative Department of Mines and Smelting Works,\" a position\r\nfor which he had previously applied. As a rule, places do not seek\r\npersons, however brilliant; they must seek places.\r\n\r\nThis was a fine opening for a young man, not yet twenty-three. He went\r\nto work with unbounded energy. He investigated the general form of\r\nmountains, collected information as to former methods of working the\r\nmines, by having three chests of mining documents, belonging to the\r\nsixteenth century, brought to him for careful study, and made a report\r\non the salt, alum, and vitriol works, and on the porcelain manufactory.\r\nThe government authorities were so pleased with his thorough report that\r\nhe was appointed superintendent of mines in the two Franconian duchies.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Freiesleben: \"I am quite intoxicated with joy.... Do not\r\nfeel anxious about my health; I shall take care not to over-exert\r\nmyself, and after the first the work will not be heavy. I cannot\r\nconclude without acknowledging that it is again to you that I am\r\nindebted for this happiness; indeed I feel it only too keenly. What\r\nknowledge have I, dear Freiesleben, that has not been taught me by\r\nyou!... How sweet is the thought to me that it is to you that I owe all\r\nthis; it seems as if it bound me closer to you, as if I carried\r\nsomething about me that had been planted within me and cultivated by\r\nyourself....\"\r\n\r\nThus all through life was the appreciative, warm-hearted man glad to\r\nshow his gratitude for the stimulus of intellectual friends.\r\n\r\nWho does not love to be appreciated! How many of us wait to say kind\r\nthings to our friends until death makes it impossible!\r\n\r\nAgain he wrote: \"I possess a certain amount of vanity, and am willing to\r\nconfess it; but I know the power of my own will, and I feel that\r\nwhatever I set myself to do I shall do well.\"\r\n\r\nWhile so earnestly engaged in study, Humboldt, with his benevolent\r\nheart, could not see the children of the miners grow up in ignorance.\r\nHe therefore opened free schools for them, and paid the teachers from\r\nhis own purse. Not many young men at twenty-four would have thought of\r\nso admirable a plan.\r\n\r\nMeantime he was experiencing the first keen joy of fame. The Elector of\r\nSaxony had sent the author of \"Flora Fribergensis\" a gold medal. The\r\nSwedish botanist Vahl had named a magnificent species of an East Indian\r\nlaurel after him, the _laurifolia Humboldtia_. It had paid to be a\r\nstudent; to be led by the \"eager impulse\" within him.\r\n\r\nThe next year he wrote to Freiesleben:--\r\n\r\n\"You are aware that I am quite mad enough to be engaged upon three books\r\nat once.... I have discovered several new lichens. I have also been\r\noccupied upon the history of the weaving of the ancients.... My head is\r\nquite distracted with all I have to attend to--mining, banking,\r\nmanufacturing, and organizing; ... the mines, however, are\r\nprospering.... I am promoted to be counsellor of mines at Berlin, with a\r\nsalary, probably, of fifteen hundred thalers (here I have four hundred),\r\nand, after remaining there a few months, I shall most likely be\r\nappointed director of mines, either in Westphalia or Rothenburg, and\r\nreceive from two thousand to three thousand thalers. I tell you\r\neverything, and open my heart to you.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1795, having resigned his position in the service of the state,\r\nbecause of his desire for travel and scientific work, with two friends,\r\nFreiesleben, and Lieutenant Reinhard von Haften, of Westphalia, he\r\njourneyed to Venice, going through the Tyrol and the Alps into\r\nSwitzerland. They visited the mountains around Schaffhausen, Zuerich, and\r\nBerne, and such notable men of science as De Luc, Pictet, and Saussure.\r\nAs Freiesleben said, \"No subject having any reference to the physical\r\nconstitution of the earth, the atmosphere, or any point of natural\r\nhistory, was allowed to escape his attention.\"\r\n\r\nAn especial bond united Humboldt and the highly educated Von Haften,\r\nsince between the latter's sister Minette and the young scientist there\r\nexisted a devoted affection. This was cherished for ten years, but\r\nHumboldt's life of travel and exposure prevented a union which both\r\nardently desired. He sacrificed his affections to science, and the\r\nloneliness of his later years proved the unwisdom of his choice.\r\n\r\nOn his return home, Humboldt set himself earnestly to the writing of two\r\nbooks: one on geology, the disposition of strata in mountain masses; the\r\nother on the \"Excitability of the Nerves and Muscles,\" describing over\r\nfour thousand experiments. His devotion to science was shown by the\r\npainful experiments upon his own body, which brought permanent harm to\r\nhis nervous system.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to a friend: \"I applied two blisters to my back, each of the\r\nsize of a crown-piece, and covering respectively the trapezius and\r\ndeltoid muscles.... When the blisters were cut, and contact made with\r\nzinc and silver, I experienced a sharp pain, which was so severe that\r\nthe trapezius muscle swelled considerably, and the quivering was\r\ncommunicated upwards to the base of the skull and the spinous processes\r\nof the vertebrae.\"\r\n\r\nHe also experimented with the noxious gases in mines, inventing lamps\r\nwhich were the forerunner of Sir Humphrey Davy's. Sometimes he was\r\ndeprived of consciousness by the gases and saved only by the timely aid\r\nof friends.\r\n\r\nAlways longing for foreign travel, he went to Weimar, to make himself\r\nmore fully ready for it, especially by the study of anatomy. Here lived\r\nhis brother William, who had married a brilliant and intellectual woman,\r\nthe intimate friend of the wife of Schiller.\r\n\r\nHere Humboldt and Goethe became earnest friends. Goethe says: \"During\r\nHumboldt's visit, my time has been usefully and agreeably spent; his\r\npresence has had the effect of arousing from its winter sleep my taste\r\nfor natural science.\" Years afterward Goethe said to Eckermann:\r\n\"Alexander von Humboldt has been with me for some hours this morning;\r\nwhat an extraordinary man he is! Though I have known him for so long, I\r\nam always struck with fresh amazement in his company. He may be said to\r\nbe without a rival in extent of information and acquaintance with\r\nexisting sciences. He possesses, too, a versatility of genius which I\r\nhave never seen equalled. Whatever may be the subject broached, he\r\nseems quite at home in it, and showers upon us treasures in profusion\r\nfrom his stores of knowledge. He resembles a living fountain, whence\r\nflow many streams, yielding to all comers a quickening and refreshing\r\ndraught. He will remain here a few days, and I already feel that I shall\r\nhave lived through years in the time.\"\r\n\r\nThat Humboldt valued this friendship is shown by the dedication to\r\nGoethe of the first part of his \"Travels in America.\"\r\n\r\nThe project of foreign travel was long delayed by sickness, war, and\r\nvarious disappointments. But, in life, obstacles are the common lot of\r\nmortals, and he alone is wise who breasts them cheerfully, patiently,\r\nand persistently. Humboldt said, \"It is impossible not to feel the\r\nseverity of this disappointment; but it is the part of a man to work,\r\nand not to yield to unavailing regrets.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Hard! well, and what of that?\r\n  Didst fancy life one summer holiday,\r\n  With lessons none to learn, and naught but play?\r\n  Go, get thee to thy task. Conquer or die!\r\n  It must be learned. Learn it then, patiently.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1799, when Humboldt was thirty, the long contemplated\r\njourney to South America was about to be realized. He had already\r\npublished some astronomical treatises on the determination of latitudes,\r\ntrigonometrical measures of the Alpine ranges, etc.; had given lectures\r\nin Paris, before the National Institute, on the nature of nitrous gas,\r\nand the possibility of a more exact analysis of the atmosphere; and had\r\nspent some time in Spain, with the well known botanist Bonpland, in\r\ncollecting plants, and making observations in connection with\r\nmeteorology, geology, and magnetism. While at Madrid, through Herr von\r\nForell, a distinguished patron of science, Humboldt was received at\r\ncourt and obtained permission of the king to visit the Spanish colonies\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nAt his own expense, the best scientific instruments were procured, and\r\nJune 5, 1799, at two o'clock in the afternoon, he and Bonpland, with\r\ntheir crew and a few others, sailed away, in the corvette Pizarro, for a\r\nfive years' journey. He sent tender farewell messages back to \"his\r\nfamily,\" as he called William's children, and then stifled any feelings\r\nof loneliness or homesickness which he had in his heart, by his favorite\r\nmotto, \"Man must ever strive after all that is good and great.\"\r\n\r\nJune 20, they were at the foot of the Peak of Teneriffe. He wrote to his\r\nbrother: \"I am quite in a state of ecstasy at finding myself at length\r\non African soil, surrounded by cocoa-nut palms and bananas.... I\r\nreturned last night from an excursion up the peak. What an amazing\r\nscene! What a gratification! We descended some way into the crater,\r\nperhaps farther than any previous scientific traveller.... What a\r\nremarkable spectacle was presented to us at this height of eleven\r\nthousand five hundred feet.... At two in the morning we were already on\r\nour way towards the last cone. The heavens were bright with stars, and\r\nthe moon shone with a gentle radiance; but this calm was soon to be\r\ndisturbed. The storm raged violently round the summit; we were obliged\r\nto cling fast to the edge of the crater. The wind rushed through the\r\nrifts with a noise like thunder, while a veil of cloud separated us from\r\nthe world below.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a voyage of nineteen days, the ship entered the harbor of Cumana,\r\non the north coast of South America. Here they enjoyed the new and\r\nstrange scenes; the houses built of satin-wood; the copper-colored\r\nIndians outside the town, living in bamboo huts, covered with the leaves\r\nof the cocoa-nut palm; these great trees from fifty to sixty feet high,\r\nwith large red bunches of flowers. \"Even the crabs,\" said Humboldt, \"are\r\nsky-blue and gold!\"\r\n\r\nBy November they had dried more than sixteen hundred plants, and\r\ndescribed about six hundred new varieties. He had taken observations of\r\nthe solar eclipse of October 28, and so severely burnt his face that he\r\nwas obliged to remain in bed for two days.\r\n\r\nGoing to Caracas, they spent two months and a half climbing mountains,\r\nvisiting hot springs, and forming an intimate acquaintance with tigers,\r\ncrocodiles, monkeys, and boa constrictors. Here they discovered the\r\nsingular cow-tree, with dry and tough leaves, but which gives out a\r\nsweet nourishing milk when an incision is made in its stem. \"At sunrise\r\nthis vegetable spring is the richest: then the negroes and the natives\r\ncome from all sides, provided with large vessels to collect the milk,\r\nwhich turns yellow and thickens on the surface.\"\r\n\r\nIn February, 1800, the travellers traced the water system of the\r\nOrinoco, often in the midst of danger. Once, in a severe storm, their\r\nboat was two-thirds full of water. \"Our position,\" says Humboldt, \"was\r\ntruly appalling; the shore was distant from us more than a mile, where a\r\nnumber of crocodiles could be discerned lying half out of the water.\r\nEven if we had gained the shore against the fury of the waves and the\r\nvoracity of the crocodiles, we should infallibly have either perished\r\nfrom hunger or been torn in pieces by the tigers, for the woods upon\r\nthese shores are so dense and so intertwined with lianas as to be\r\nabsolutely impenetrable. The strongest man, axe in hand, could hardly\r\nmake his way in twenty days for the distance of a league. The river too\r\nis so little frequented that even an Indian canoe scarcely passes\r\noftener than once in two months. At this most momentous and perilous\r\ncrisis a gust of wind filled the sails of our little vessel and effected\r\nin a marvellous manner our deliverance.\"\r\n\r\nTo his botanist friend, Willdenow, he writes:--\"During four months of\r\nthis journey we passed the night in forests, surrounded by crocodiles,\r\nboa constrictors, and tigers, which are here bold enough to attack a\r\ncanoe, while for food we had nothing better than rice, ants, bananas,\r\nand occasionally the flesh of monkeys, with only the waters of the\r\nOrinoco wherewith to quench our thirst. Thus have we with difficulty\r\ntoiled, our hands and faces swollen with mosquito bites, from Mondvaca\r\nto the volcano of Duida, from the limits of Quito to the frontier of\r\nSurinam--through tracts of country extending over twenty thousand square\r\nmiles, in which no Indian is to be met with, and where the traveller\r\nencounters only apes or serpents.\r\n\r\n\"In Guiana the mosquitoes abound in such clouds as to darken the air,\r\nand, as it is absolutely necessary to keep head and hands constantly\r\ncovered, no writing can be done by daylight; the intolerable pain\r\nproduced by the attacks of these insects renders it impossible to hold\r\nthe pen steadily. All our work had therefore to be carried on by the\r\nlight of a fire, in an Indian hut, where no ray of sunlight could\r\npenetrate, and into which we had to creep on our hands and knees. Here,\r\nif we escaped the torment of the mosquitoes, we were almost choked by\r\nthe smoke. At Maypures, we and the Indians took refuge in the midst of\r\nthe cascade, where the spray from the foaming stream kept off the\r\ninsects. At Higuerote, the people are accustomed at night to lie buried\r\nthree or four inches deep in sand, with only the head exposed.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes twenty-four Indians were in Humboldt's employ for months\r\ntogether, and fourteen mules were required to carry his instruments and\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nAfter a year and a half spent in South America, Humboldt sailed for\r\nCuba, where he remained for several months, collecting material for his\r\n\"Political Essay on the Island of Cuba.\" From there he went to Quito, in\r\nEcuador, crossing one of the most difficult passes in the Andes, \"the\r\npath so narrow that it rarely exceeds twelve or sixteen inches in width,\r\nand for the most part resembles an open gallery cut in the rock,\" and\r\nthe Paramos of Pasto, \"desert regions where, at a height of about twelve\r\nthousand feet above the sea, all vegetation ceases, and the cold is so\r\nintense as to penetrate to the very bones.\"\r\n\r\nIn June, 1802, they reached Quito, where, five years previously, an\r\nearthquake had destroyed forty thousand people. This month they made the\r\nascent of Chimborazo, at that time regarded as the highest mountain in\r\nthe world. \"At certain places,\" he says, \"where it was very steep, we\r\nwere obliged to use both hands and feet, and the edges of the rock were\r\nso sharp that we were painfully cut, especially on our hands.\" As they\r\nclimbed on, \"one after another, we all began to feel indisposed, and\r\nexperienced a feeling of nausea accompanied by giddiness, which was far\r\nmore distressing than the difficulty of breathing.... Blood exuded from\r\nthe lips and gums, and the eyes became bloodshot.... A few rock-lichens\r\nwere to be observed above the line of perpetual snow, at a height of\r\nsixteen thousand nine hundred and twenty feet; the last green moss we\r\nnoticed was growing about twenty-six hundred feet lower. A butterfly was\r\ncaptured by M. Bonpland, at a height of fifteen thousand feet, and a\r\nfly was observed sixteen hundred feet higher.... When we were at a\r\nheight of about seventeen thousand four hundred feet we encountered a\r\nviolent hailstorm.\" The height of the mountain is over twenty-one\r\nthousand feet.\r\n\r\nThe intrepid Humboldt four times crossed the Andes; he travelled over\r\nPeru; he called attention to the fertilizing properties of guano, and\r\nthen he sailed for Mexico, where he remained for a year. Here he met a\r\nlady greatly esteemed in that country, called the \"fair Rodriguez,\" the\r\nmost beautiful woman he had seen in his journeys, but whom he admired\r\nmore \"for her graces of mind than her beauty of person.\" He regarded her\r\nas an American Madame de Stael. It is asserted that the grave man of\r\nscience was deeply interested, but it was too late--she was already the\r\nwife of another, and had two children. Humboldt, like most other great\r\nmen, all his life enjoyed the society of intellectual women, who were a\r\nconstant inspiration.\r\n\r\nAfter two months passed at Havana, Humboldt came to the United States,\r\nspending three weeks with President Jefferson, at his home at\r\nMonticello. He never failed to speak in grateful terms of the courtesy\r\nhe received from Americans. He studied carefully our institutions, and\r\ngreatly admired the republic; slavery alone saddened him.\r\n\r\nOn July 9, 1804, after five years of absence, he set sail for France.\r\nEurope received him with universal joy. He had been reported dead. He\r\nwas thirty-five, handsome, and famous. He had travelled over forty\r\nthousand miles, and brought back over sixty thousand specimens of\r\nplants. He was made a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Berlin,\r\nand later a member of the Legion of Honor, and of about one hundred and\r\nfifty other societies; indeed, of all the great associations of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAnd now the result of his travels must be given to the world in books.\r\nWhile he was preparing them, he yet found time to spend months together\r\nin the Ecole Polytechnique, experimenting in chemistry with his devoted\r\nfriend Gay-Lussac; with Biot, he made investigations in magnetism; with\r\nArago, in astronomy; with Cuvier, in anatomy.\r\n\r\nMost of the time from 1808 to 1827, nineteen years, he remained in\r\nParis, devoting his time to his great work. In the forenoons he usually\r\nstudied and experimented; from twelve to seven he wrote, and then, if\r\nhis evenings were spent socially, he wrote again from midnight till\r\nhalf-past two, usually allowing himself only four hours for sleep. So\r\npopular was he that he often went to five receptions in an evening.\r\n\r\nYear after year his works on America appeared, till twenty-nine volumes\r\nwere published! The first part was entitled, \"Voyage in the Equatorial\r\nRegions of the New Continent.\" This described a portion of his journey\r\nin three volumes; views of the Cordilleras and the native peoples of\r\nAmerica, one volume with sixty plates; an atlas of the new continent,\r\nwith thirty-nine maps; a critical examination of the history of the\r\ngeography of the middle ages, in five volumes. The second part related\r\nlargely to zooelogy and comparative anatomy in the new regions; the third\r\npart related chiefly to Mexico; the fourth part to astronomical\r\nobservations, measurement with the barometer, etc.; the fifth part,\r\ngeology, and the geography of plants; the sixth part, plants in Mexico,\r\nCuba, and South America, in two volumes, with nearly one hundred and\r\nfifty engravings; two volumes more, with one hundred and twenty colored\r\nplates; seven volumes of new species, with seven hundred engravings, and\r\nseveral other books. The expense of bringing out these works was\r\nenormous; the copper-plate illustrations cost in printing and paper\r\nalone about one hundred and seventy thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nAs the price of the volumes was about twenty-seven hundred dollars, the\r\nnumber of purchasers was comparatively limited. Humboldt had used all\r\nhis fortune in his journeys and in publishing his books, and was now a\r\npoor man, dependent upon a pension from his king. But he was the pride\r\nof his nation, and beloved in France as well.\r\n\r\nHumboldt and Guizot were like brothers, and for forty years corresponded\r\naffectionately with each other. Arago he held \"dearest in this life.\"\r\nHis last letter to Arago, \"small in size but so full of matter,\" was\r\nthe greatest comfort to the dying astronomer.\r\n\r\nDuring all these busy twenty years he had honors heaped upon him. He was\r\noffered the position of Ambassador to Vienna, but declined. He\r\naccompanied the King of Prussia to England in 1814, and was with him at\r\nthe peace of Aix-la-Chapelle and at the Congress of Verona.\r\n\r\nBusy as he was, he seemed to find time to befriend everybody, especially\r\nyoung men. Liebig says in the preface of his work dedicated to Humboldt:\r\n\"During my residence in Paris, I gave a course of lectures at the\r\nAcademy in the winter of 1823-4, upon an analytic investigation of\r\nHoward's fulminating mercury and silver--my first effort in the field of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\"At the close of the sitting of March 22, 1824, while busy packing up my\r\napparatus, a gentleman came up to me from among a group of academicians,\r\nand entered into conversation. In the most winning manner, he made\r\ninquiry as to the objects of my study, my present occupations, and the\r\nplans I had laid for the future. We separated without my knowing to whom\r\nI was indebted for this kind expression of interest, for my shyness and\r\ninexperience had not allowed me to make the inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"This conversation laid the foundation of my future career, for I thus\r\nacquired a kind friend and a powerful patron in my scientific\r\nundertakings....\r\n\r\n\"From that time all doors were thrown open to me, I had access to every\r\ninstitution and every laboratory: the great interest you took in me\r\nprocured the love and intimate friendship of my instructors, Gay-Lussac,\r\nDulong, and Thenard, to all of whom I became deeply attached. The\r\nconfidence which you accorded me was the means of my introduction into a\r\nsphere of labor which during the last sixteen years it has ever been my\r\nambition worthily to occupy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Agassiz was a poor medical student in Paris, Humboldt visited him.\r\nAgassiz says:--\r\n\r\n\"After a cordial greeting, he walked straight to what was then my\r\nlibrary--a small book-shelf containing a few classics, the meanest\r\neditions, bought for a trifle, along the quays, some works on philosophy\r\nand history, chemistry and physics, his own 'Aspects of Nature,'\r\n'Aristotle's Zooelogy,' 'Linnaeus' Systema Naturae,' in several editions,\r\n'Cuvier's Regne Animal,' and quite a number of manuscript quartos,\r\ncopies which, with the assistance of my brother, I had made of works I\r\nwas too poor to buy, though they cost but a few francs a volume....\r\n\r\n\"It was no doubt apparent to him that I was not over-familiar with the\r\ngood things of this world, for I shortly afterward received an\r\ninvitation to meet him at six o'clock in the Galerie Vitree of the\r\nPalais Royal, whence he led me into one of those restaurants the\r\ntempting windows of which I had occasionally passed by. When we were\r\nseated, he half laughingly, half inquiringly, asked me whether I would\r\norder the dinner. I declined the invitation, saying that we should fare\r\nbetter if he would take the trouble. And for three hours, which passed\r\nlike a dream, I had him all to myself. How he examined me, and how much\r\nI learned in that short time! How to work, what to do, and what to\r\navoid; how to live; how to distribute my time; what methods of study to\r\npursue; these were the things of which he talked to me on that\r\ndelightful evening.\"\r\n\r\nNoble Humboldt! so great that everybody honored and looked up to him; so\r\nkindly interested in others that everybody loved him!\r\n\r\nIn 1827, at the request of his king, Humboldt returned to Berlin, and\r\nbecame chamberlain, with a yearly salary of five thousand thalers. He\r\ngave this year, before the university, a course of free, public lectures\r\nupon physical geography, sixty nine in all, which afterwards formed the\r\nbasis of his grandest work, \"Cosmos.\" The first four lectures were a\r\ngeneral description of nature; then astronomy, the principal outlines of\r\ngeology and meteorology, the distribution of plants and animals, the\r\nhistory of the study of our globe, volcanoes, the ocean, the atmosphere,\r\nand the human race.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were crowded and the applause unexampled. A second course,\r\nof sixteen lectures, was given to the public in the music hall, the\r\nroyal family coming with the thousands who gathered each evening.\r\n\r\nA grand way to educate the people! Would that at the expense of some\r\nphilanthropist such a course might be given in every city.\r\n\r\nIn 1829, at the request of Emperor Nicholas, Humboldt made a scientific\r\nexpedition to eastern Russia, travelling over nine thousand miles in\r\ntwenty-five weeks. He was now in his sixtieth year, but he climbed high\r\nmountains with no apparent fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was delighted with the results of the expedition, which were\r\npublished in several volumes. He said, \"Your sojourn in Russia has been\r\nthe cause of immense progress to my country; you spread a life-giving\r\ninfluence wherever you go.\" He presented Humboldt with a sable cloak\r\nworth five thousand rubles, and a malachite vase seven feet high, worth\r\nnearly forty thousand rubles.\r\n\r\nThe death of friends saddened this busy year, 1829. William's wife had\r\ndied, and left him utterly desolate. In his ministry to several\r\ncountries, she had honored and graced his diplomatic positions. He did\r\nnot long survive her. \"Wholly given up to grief,\" said Alexander, \"he\r\nseeks in the depth of his misery the only consolation that can render\r\nlife supportable, while he occupies himself with intellectual pursuits\r\nas with the drudgery of a task.\"\r\n\r\nHe died four years later, tenderly watched over by his illustrious\r\nbrother, to whom he said in dying, \"Think of me often, but always with\r\ncheerfulness. I have been very happy, and even to-day has been a\r\nglorious day with me, for there is nothing more beautiful than love. I\r\nshall soon be with _the mother_, and enter upon a higher order of\r\nbeing.\"\r\n\r\nThis death was a great blow to Alexander. He said, \"I am quite bereft of\r\nhope. I did not think that my old eyes could have shed so many tears....\r\nI am the unhappiest of men.... I have lost half of myself.\" A few months\r\nlater William's eldest daughter, Caroline, died, to whom Alexander was\r\ntenderly attached. From henceforth his life was devoted to his sovereign\r\nFrederick William IV., to \"Cosmos,\" and to his ever widening circle of\r\nfriends. Two thousand letters or more came to him yearly, and till late\r\nin life he answered each one, and answered it promptly, showing thereby\r\nhow truly well bred he was in manner, and how truly kind in heart.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, when he was sixty-five, he began the publication of \"Cosmos,\"\r\nin five volumes, the \"most comprehensive compendium of modern science.\"\r\nIt was soon translated into English, meeting with a cordial reception in\r\nthat country, and into French, Dutch, and Italian.\r\n\r\nEven at the age of sixty-five, so eager was he to know more that he\r\nattended courses of lectures on Grecian antiquities and literature, and\r\nupon chemistry, taking notes among the young university students. He now\r\nlived with the king, at Sans-Souci, spending every evening with him, and\r\nbecoming the confidential friend of both king and queen. When Humboldt\r\nwas ill, the king would read to him by the hour.\r\n\r\nFrederick William IV. conferred on him the decoration of the Star of the\r\nRed Eagle, the Order of the Black Eagle, the highest honor in the royal\r\npower to confer, and the Order of Merit, given to those \"who throughout\r\nEurope have won for themselves a name either in the arts or sciences.\"\r\n\r\nTill the last years of his life Humboldt showed the same marvellous\r\nenergy and industry. At eighty he said, \"I am more than ever filled with\r\na zest for work and literary distinction.\" When he wrote to friends for\r\ninformation in finishing \"Cosmos,\" he asked for speedy answers, saying,\r\n\"The dead ride fast.\" On the fortieth anniversary of his return to\r\nEurope, a fete was given in his honor, by the Berlin Academy. Later his\r\nbust was placed in the French Institute. The freedom of the city of\r\nBerlin was presented to him. America sent him in 1858, on his\r\neighty-ninth birthday, an album of nine maps, showing the scores of\r\ntowns, counties, rivers, bays, and mountains which had received his\r\nname. Letters came from all parts of the world, breathing love and\r\nadmiration. Yet, with all this honor, he was often lonely, and spoke of\r\nthe _ennui_ of life. After the regency, Humboldt lived at Berlin, in an\r\nunostentatious home, with his attendant, Seifert.\r\n\r\nOn May 6, 1859, at half-past two in the afternoon, death came to\r\nAlexander von Humboldt, at the age of ninety. His mind was clear to the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nAll ranks gathered at the public funeral, for all, from king to peasant,\r\nhad lost a friend. With uncovered head, the Prince Regent received the\r\nprocession at the door of the cathedral, amid the tolling of the bells,\r\nand then they buried him at the summer home of his childhood, Tegel, by\r\nthe side of William.\r\n\r\nA new edition of his select works, including \"Cosmos,\" was published in\r\nStuttgart, in 1874, in thirty-six volumes.\r\n\r\nGreat in learning, great in achievement, great in will-power; unwise\r\nsometimes in utterance, as in the Varnhagen letters--how seldom is it\r\nsafe or wise to express our inmost thoughts;--sarcastic sometimes in his\r\nlanguage--a dangerous power, to be used sparingly, if indeed ever,--and\r\nyet withal a noble, unselfish, marvellous-minded man, who, as Agassiz\r\nsays, \"exerted upon science a personal influence which is\r\nincalculable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR HUMPHREY DAVY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR HUMPHREY DAVY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nColeridge said, \"Had not Davy been the first chemist, he probably would\r\nhave been the first poet of his age.\"\r\n\r\nSaid Professor Silliman's \"American Journal of Science and Arts:\" \"His\r\nreputation is too intimately associated with the eternal laws of nature\r\nto suffer decay; and the name of Davy, like those of Archimedes,\r\nGalileo, and Newton, which grow greener by time, will descend to the\r\nlatest posterity.\"\r\n\r\nDavy was poor and self-taught, but he triumphed over obstacles, and died\r\nuniversally lamented.\r\n\r\nThe eldest son in a family of five children, Humphrey Davy was born at\r\nPenzance, Cornwall, England, December 17, 1778, the year in which Carl\r\nLinnaeus died. He was a bright, active child, making rhymes when he was\r\nfive years old, and reciting them at the Christmas gatherings. In\r\nconsequence of his retentive memory, he could repeat a great part of\r\n\"Pilgrim's Progress\" before he could read it. This book and \"AEsop's\r\nFables\" were his favorites.\r\n\r\nWhen Humphrey was six, he was sent to a grammar school kept by Rev. Mr.\r\nCoryton, a man who had the vicious habit of punishing by pulling the\r\npupils' ears. On one occasion, Humphrey came to school with a large\r\nplaster on each ear. Upon being asked what was the matter, he said, with\r\na grave face, that he had \"put the plasters on to prevent a\r\nmortification!\"\r\n\r\nAs he grew older, he composed Latin and English verses easily, and was\r\nin great demand among the boys as a writer of valentines and\r\nlove-letters. Though shy in manner, with his vivid imagination and flow\r\nof language, he told stories remarkably well, and might have been seen,\r\noften, in a cart at the Star Inn, addressing a most attentive audience.\r\n\r\nSays his brother, Dr. John Davy, \"Humphrey, when a boy, was fond of\r\ndeclaiming, and indulged in it in his solitary walks and rambles. On one\r\noccasion it is recorded of him, that, on his way to visit a poor patient\r\nin the country (during his apprenticeship), in the fever of declamation,\r\nhe threw out of his hand a vial of medicine which he had to administer,\r\nand that when he arrived at the bedside of the poor woman he was\r\nsurprised at the loss of it. The potion was found the next day in a\r\nhay-field adjoining the path.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Humphrey was fourteen he attended the Truro Grammar School for a\r\nyear, where he was greatly liked for his good-humor, affectionate\r\ndisposition, and originality. Says Mr. Nicholls, a school friend, \"I can\r\nnever forget that as boys we knew and loved each other. I recollect a\r\nvisit he paid in company with his aunt at my father's, who then resided\r\nat Lanarth. He was a great favorite; but there was even then an original\r\nmode of thinking and acting observable in him,--one instance of which I\r\nwell remember;--it was on rather a hot day, when my father, mother, your\r\naunt, Humphrey, and myself, were to walk to a place a mile or two\r\ndistant, I forget for what purpose. Whilst others complained of the\r\nheat, and whilst I unbuttoned my waistcoat, Humphrey appeared with his\r\ngreat-coat close-buttoned up to his chin, for the purpose, as he\r\ndeclared, of keeping _out_ the heat. This was laughed at at the time,\r\nbut it struck me then, as it appears to me now, as evincing originality\r\nof thought and an indisposition to be led by the example of others.\"\r\n\r\nAt fifteen his school education was considered complete. The next year\r\nhe studied French, gave a good deal of time to fishing, of which he was\r\nalways fond, and apparently had little definite purpose. About this time\r\nhis father died, and the straitened circumstances of the family now\r\nseemed to awaken all the energy and nobility of his nature. Seeing his\r\nmother in deep affliction, he begged her not to grieve, saying that \"_he\r\nwould do all he could for his brothers and sisters_.\" And he never\r\nforgot this promise.\r\n\r\nThe following year he was apprenticed to Mr. Bingham Borlase, practising\r\nsurgeon and apothecary in Penzance. Young Davy now seemed destined to\r\nbecome a physician, but his note-books show that he intended to know\r\nother things besides medicine. He laid out a plan for study: theology,\r\nlogic, astronomy, mathematics, Latin, Greek, Italian, Spanish, and\r\nHebrew.\r\n\r\nHe said later, \"Almost all great deeds arise from a plenitude of hope or\r\ndesire. No man ever had genius who did not aim to execute more than he\r\nwas able.\" And all his life he planned to do twice as much as he was\r\never able to do. And yet he knew that he must bind himself to a _few_\r\nthings, if he would succeed. He said, \"In minds of great power, there is\r\nusually a disposition to variety of pursuits, and they often attempt all\r\nbranches of letters and science, and even the imitative arts; but if\r\nthey become truly eminent, it is by devotion to one object at a time, or\r\nat most two objects. This sort of general power is like a profusion of\r\nblossoms on a fruit tree, a symptom of health and strength; but if all\r\nare suffered to become fruit, all are feeble and bad; if the greater\r\nportion is destroyed by accident or art, the remainder, being properly\r\nnourished, become healthy, large, and good.\" In these early note-books,\r\nhe began to show an unusual and mature mind. He wrote essays: \"On the\r\nImmortality and the Immateriality of the Soul,\" \"On Governments,\" \"On\r\nMoral Obligation,\" and the like. Of Friendship, he wrote at seventeen:\r\n\"It is a composition of the noblest passions of the mind; a just taste\r\nand love of virtue, good-sense, a thorough candor and benignity of\r\nheart, and a generous sympathy of sentiment and affections, are the\r\nessential ingredients of this nobler passion. When it originates from\r\nlove and esteem, is strengthened by habit, and mellowed by time, it\r\nyields infinite pleasure, ever new and ever growing. It is the best\r\nsupport amongst the numerous trials and vicissitudes of life, and gives\r\na relish to most of our enjoyments. What can be imagined more\r\ncomfortable than to have a friend to console us in afflictions, to\r\nadvise with us in doubtful cases, and share our felicity?... It exalts\r\nour nobler passions, and weakens our evil inclinations; it assists us to\r\nrun the race of virtue with a steady and undeviating course. From\r\nloving, esteeming, and endeavoring to felicitate particular people, a\r\nmore general passion will arise for the whole of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nHe finishes this essay with an allegory. God is described as\r\ndeliberating with the angels on the propriety of creating woman.\r\nJustice, Peace, and Virtue plead against her creation, as through her\r\nAdam will be driven out of Paradise. Then Divine Love stands before\r\nJehovah, her countenance covered with smiles. \"Create her,\" she says,\r\n\"for Paradise itself will afford no delight to man without woman. She\r\nwill be the cause of his misery, but she will likewise be the cause of\r\nall his happiness. She will console him in affliction; she will comfort\r\nand harmonize his soul; she will wipe the tears from his eyes, and\r\ncompose the fury of his passions. Her friendship shall make him\r\nvirtuous, and her love shall make him happy; and, lastly, the tree of\r\ntheir transgression, and the plant of immortality, nourished by the\r\nblood of her son, shall flourish, and grow out of Paradise, and\r\noverspread the earth: man shall eat of their fruit, and be immortal and\r\nhappy.\"\r\n\r\nAll through these early note-books are scattered his poems, showing a\r\npassion for the blue sea at Penzance, and an unbounded love of nature.\r\n\r\nJust as he was entering his nineteenth year, young Davy began the study\r\nof chemistry, as a branch of his profession. He read \"Lavoisier's\r\nElements of Chemistry,\" and \"Nicholson's Dictionary of Chemistry.\"\r\nSuddenly a new world seemed to open before him. He began to think for\r\nhimself, and to make experiments. As his means were limited, his\r\napparatus consisted of vials, wine-glasses, tea-cups, tobacco-pipes, and\r\nearthen crucibles.\r\n\r\nHis first experiments were the effects of acids and alkalies on\r\nvegetable colors, the kind of air in the vesicles of common seaweed, and\r\nthe solution and precipitation of metals. These were made in his bedroom\r\nin Mr. Tonkin's house, or in the kitchen, when he required fire. This\r\nold gentleman had brought up his mother and her two orphan sisters, and\r\nnow was like a father to Humphrey. He said, \"This boy, Humphrey, is\r\nincorrigible. Was there ever so idle a dog! He will blow us all into the\r\nair.\" He was at this time probably making a detonating composition,\r\nwhich he called \"thunder power,\" his sister Kitty being his assistant.\r\n\r\nAt this time, a young man came to board at the house of Mrs. Davy,\r\nGregory Watt, the only child of James Watt, the inventor of the\r\nsteam-engine. He was the idol of his parents; possessed of a mind so\r\nunusual in its passionate love for knowledge, and a nature so\r\ncompanionable, that everybody loved him. He was twenty-one, and Humphrey\r\nnineteen.\r\n\r\nBetween these two young men there grew a most ardent and lasting\r\nfriendship; lasting because it had the only sure foundation, moral and\r\nmental worth. They were always together. They visited the neighboring\r\nmines and mountains, and came home with their pockets filled with\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant Gregory died at twenty-eight, but Davy lived to show the\r\nfruits of one of the most beautiful things in life, the affinity of two\r\nnoble and intellectual souls, with similar tastes and aspirations. This\r\ndeath was a great loss to Humphrey. He wrote to a friend: \"Poor Watt! He\r\nought not to have died. I could not persuade myself that he would die:\r\nand until the very moment when I was assured of his fate, I would not\r\nbelieve he was in any danger.\r\n\r\n\"His letters to me only three or four months ago were full of spirit,\r\nand spoke not of any infirmity of body, but of an increased strength of\r\nmind. Why is this in the order of nature, that there is such a\r\ndifference in the duration and destruction of her works? If the mere\r\nstone decays, it is to produce a soil which is capable of nourishing\r\nthe moss and the lichen; when the moss and the lichen die, and\r\ndecompose, they produce a mould, which becomes the bed of life to\r\ngrasses, and to more exalted species of vegetables. Vegetables are the\r\nfood of animals; the less perfect animals of the more perfect; but in\r\nman the faculties and intellect are perfected. He rises, exists for a\r\nlittle while in disease and misery; and then would seem to disappear,\r\nwithout an end, and without producing any effect.\r\n\r\n\"We are deceived, my dear Clayfield, if we suppose that the human being,\r\nwho has formed himself for action, but who has been unable to act, is\r\nlost in the mass of being; there is some arrangement of things which we\r\ncan never comprehend, but in which his faculties will be applied....\r\nGregory was a noble fellow, and would have been a great man. Oh! there\r\nwas no reason for his dying--he ought not to have died.\"\r\n\r\nThis death broke the spirit of James Watt, the father, who ever after\r\nkept beside him, in the attic at Heathfield, the little, old-fashioned\r\nhair trunk of his beloved Gregory, full of his school-books, letters,\r\nand childish toys. It stands to-day, where it did eighty years ago,\r\nbeside the mouldering beams of the sculpture machine. That life is not\r\nshort, however few the years, which leaves such an undying influence and\r\nsuch beautiful memories.\r\n\r\nHumphrey was now twenty-six, and much had come into his young life. He\r\nhad applied himself with zeal to his professional studies, had read\r\nLocke, and Rollin, and Gibbon, and Shakspeare, and at twenty had been\r\nappointed to take charge of the Pneumatic Institution at Clifton,\r\nestablished by Dr. Beddoes. It had been founded to give an opportunity\r\nof trying the medicinal effects of various gases, and was supported by\r\nliberal men of science. So distressed was his old friend, Mr. Tonkin,\r\nthat he should give up the idea of being a surgeon in Penzance, that he\r\nrevoked a legacy he had made him in his will!\r\n\r\nDavy's life was now an extremely busy one. He published, when he was\r\ntwenty-one, his \"Essays on Heat and Light,\" beginning his work, like Sir\r\nIsaac Newton, when but a youth. He discovered silica in the epidermis of\r\nthe stems of weeds, corn, and grasses. He found the intoxicating effects\r\nof breathing nitrous oxide, April 9, 1799, and his experiments on this\r\nsubject were published the following year. He spent ten months of\r\nincessant labor in them, often endangering and once nearly losing his\r\nlife from breathing carburetted hydrogen. He made experiments on\r\ngalvanic electricity, increasing the powers of the Galvanic Pile of\r\nVolta. He also planned and partly wrote an epic poem on the deliverance\r\nof the Israelites from Egypt.\r\n\r\nWorn with overwork, he returned to see his widowed mother at Penzance.\r\nHe had been absent a year. How glad were all to greet the rising young\r\nscientist! Not least glad was Davy's water spaniel, Chloe. When very\r\nsmall, and about to be drowned, he begged her as a gift, and with great\r\ncare reared her to be his hunting and fishing companion. At first she\r\ndid not know him, but when, with his peculiarly musical voice, he called\r\nher by name, \"she was in a transport of joy.\"\r\n\r\nDavy never forgot his early life at Penzance. In his will he left a sum\r\nof money to be paid annually to the master of the grammar school, \"_on\r\ncondition that the boys may have a holiday on his birthday_.\"\r\n\r\nOne secret of Davy's early success was, no doubt, his ambition. He used\r\nto say that he had been kept largely from the temptations of youth by\r\n\"an active mind, a deep ideal feeling of good, and _a look towards\r\nfuture greatness_.\" The young man or woman who definitely plans to be\r\nsomebody seldom finds any obstacles along the road too great to be\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nHe wrote in his note-book: \"I have neither riches, nor power, nor birth\r\nto recommend me; yet, if I live, I trust I shall not be of less service\r\nto mankind, and to my friends, than if I had been born with these\r\nadvantages.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Pneumatic Institution he found in Mrs. Beddoes \"the best and most\r\namiable woman in the world,\" a helper in the development of his genius.\r\nLike the wife of William Humboldt, and like any other woman who combines\r\nheart and intellect, Mrs. Beddoes gathered about her, in her home,\r\nColeridge and Southey, and other bright minds of Clifton. Here Davy,\r\nscarcely more than a boy, with his soft brown curling hair, his\r\nbeautiful smile, and his \"wonderfully bright eyes, which seemed almost\r\nto emit a soft light, when animated,\" in the midst of congenial friends,\r\nwas stimulated to do his best.\r\n\r\nYears after this, Wordsworth gave Dr. John Davy a letter to Coleridge,\r\non the back of which he had written: \"This from Davy, the great chemist.\r\nIt is an affectionate letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR COLERIDGE,--My mind is disturbed, and my body harassed by many\r\nlabors; yet I cannot suffer you to depart, without endeavoring to\r\nexpress to you some of the unbroken and higher feelings of my spirit,\r\nwhich have you at once for their cause and object.\r\n\r\n\"Years have passed away since we first met; and your presence, and\r\nrecollections with regard to you, have afforded me continued sources of\r\nenjoyment. Some of the better feelings of my nature have been elevated\r\nby your converse, and thoughts which you have nursed have been to me an\r\neternal source of consolation.\r\n\r\n\"In whatever part of the world you are, you will often live with me, not\r\nas a fleeting idea, but as a recollection possessed of creative\r\nenergy,--as an imagination winged with fire, inspiring and rejoicing....\r\n\r\n\"May blessings attend you, my dear friend! Do not forget me: we live for\r\ndifferent ends, and with different habits and pursuits; but our feelings\r\nwith regard to each other have, I believe, never altered. They must\r\ncontinue; they can have no natural death; and I trust they can never be\r\ndestroyed by fortune, chance, or accident.\"\r\n\r\nThus his sweet, kindly nature was an inspiration to others. He believed\r\nin amiability. He said, later, of temper in the marriage state: \"Upon\r\npoints of affection it is only for the parties themselves to form just\r\nopinions of what is really necessary to ensure the felicity of the\r\nmarriage state. Riches appear to me not at all necessary; but\r\ncompetence, I think, is; and after this more depends upon the _temper_\r\nof the individual than upon personal or even intellectual circumstances.\r\nThe finest spirits, the most exquisite wines, the nectars and ambrosias\r\nof modern tables, will be all spoilt by a few drops of bitter extract;\r\nand a bad temper has the same effect in life, which is made up, not of\r\ngreat sacrifices or duties, but of little things, in which smiles and\r\nkindness, and small obligations given habitually, are what win and\r\npreserve the heart and secure comfort.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Davy was twenty-three, a brilliant opening came to him; came as it\r\ndid to Cuvier, Newton, and others, through the influence of a friend.\r\nCount Rumford had been instrumental in founding the Royal Philosophical\r\nInstitution for the diffusion of a knowledge of science. Through his\r\nworks on heat, nitrous oxide, and galvanic electricity, Davy had made\r\nthe acquaintance of Dr. Hope, the distinguished professor of chemistry\r\nin the University of Edinburgh. He recommended Davy to Count Rumford, as\r\nfitted for the professorship of chemistry in the Royal Institution, an\r\nappointment, Davy wrote to his mother, \"as honorable as any scientific\r\nappointment in the kingdom, with an income of at least five hundred\r\npounds a year.\" He had evidently kept the \"look towards future\r\ngreatness\" in his heart.\r\n\r\nSix weeks after his arrival in London, in the spring of 1801, Davy gave\r\nhis first lecture, upon the history of galvanism, and the different\r\nmodes of accumulating galvanic influence. \"The sensation created by his\r\nfirst course of lectures at the Institution,\" says the _Philosophical\r\nMagazine_, \"and the enthusiastic admiration which they obtained, is at\r\nthis period hardly to be imagined. Men of the first rank and\r\ntalent,--the literary and the scientific, the practical and the\r\ntheoretical,--blue-stockings and women of fashion, the old and the\r\nyoung, all crowded, eagerly crowded, the lecture-room. His youth, his\r\nsimplicity, his natural eloquence, his chemical knowledge, his happy\r\nillustrations and well conducted experiments, excited universal\r\nattention and unbounded applause. Compliments, invitations, and presents\r\nwere showered upon him in abundance from all quarters; his society was\r\ncourted by all, and all appeared proud of his acquaintance.\" He usually\r\nwrote his lecture the day before he delivered it, on this day dining in\r\nhis own room, generally on fish. His manner in speaking was very\r\nanimated, but natural. He believed in enthusiasm. He said, \"Great powers\r\nhave never been exerted independent of strong feelings. The rapid\r\narrangement of ideas from their various analogies to the equally rapid\r\ncomparisons of these analogies, with facts uniformly occurring during\r\nthe progress of discovery, have existed only in those minds where the\r\nagency of strong and various motives is perceived--of motives modifying\r\neach other, mingling with each other, and producing that _fever of\r\nemotion_ which is the joy of existence and the consciousness of life.\"\r\n\r\nColeridge used to say, \"I attend Davy's lectures to increase my stock of\r\nmetaphors.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spacious and well supplied laboratory of the Institution, in\r\nmaking his experiments, says his brother, \"his zeal amounted to\r\nenthusiasm, which he more or less imparted to those around him. With\r\ncheerful voice and countenance, and a hand as ready to manipulate as his\r\nmind was quick to contrive, he was indefatigable in his exertions. He\r\nwas delighted with success, but not discouraged by failure; and he bore\r\nfailures and accidents in experiments with a patience and forbearance,\r\neven when owing to the awkwardness of assistants, which could hardly\r\nhave been expected from a person of his ardent temperament.\"\r\n\r\nHe was very happy in these years of work. Says his brother: \"In going to\r\nbed, and rising, and sometimes in the dead of night, I used to hear him,\r\nin a loud voice, reciting favorite passages in prose or verse, or\r\ndeclaiming some composition of his own, or humming some angler's song.\"\r\n\r\nHe spent his evenings often in society, but wrote to a friend\r\nconcerning himself: \"Be not alarmed, my dear friend, as to the effect of\r\nworldly society on my mind.... There are in the intellectual being of\r\nall men paramount elements,--certain habits and passions that cannot\r\nchange. I am a lover of nature with an ungratified imagination. I shall\r\ncontinue to search for untasted charms, for hidden beauties. My _real_,\r\nmy _waking_ existence is amongst the objects of scientific research.\r\nCommon amusements and enjoyments are necessary to me only as dreams to\r\ninterrupt the flow of thoughts too nearly analogous to enlighten and\r\nvivify.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his vacations he explored most parts of Great Britain, the\r\nHebrides, and Ireland, studying the geological structure, collecting\r\nagricultural knowledge, and making sketches. He never hesitated to ask\r\nquestions, and often the miners and farmers thought they had never seen\r\na person so inquisitive.\r\n\r\nIn his early years at the Institution he was asked to investigate\r\nastringent vegetables in connection with tanning. He entered the work\r\nwith his usual ardor; visited tan-yards, and made the acquaintance of\r\npractical farmers. In 1802 he began to deliver, at the request of the\r\nBoard of Agriculture, a course of lectures, \"On the Connection of\r\nChemistry with Vegetable Physiology.\" He had made himself acquainted\r\nwith the different kinds of soil and the various methods of agriculture.\r\nFor ten years he delivered these lectures at the meetings of the Board.\r\nThey were published in book form, and translated into almost every\r\nEuropean language.\r\n\r\n\"We feel grateful,\" said the _Edinburgh Review_, \"for his having thus\r\nsuspended for a time the labors of original investigation, in order to\r\napply the principles and discoveries of his favorite science to the\r\nillustration and improvement of an art which, above all others,\r\nministers to the wants and comforts of man.\"\r\n\r\nHe now continued his work with the voltaic pile or battery. If water\r\ncould be decomposed by it, why not some substances heretofore regarded\r\nas simple or elementary bodies?\r\n\r\nIn October, 1806, he discovered that potash and soda can be decomposed,\r\nwith potassium and sodium as resultant bases.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw the minute globules of potassium burst through the crust of\r\npotash, and take fire as they entered the atmosphere, he is said to have\r\nbounded about the room in ecstatic delight, some time elapsing before he\r\ncould compose himself sufficiently to go on with his experiment.\r\n\r\nHe had worked so constantly that he became very ill, and for several\r\nweeks his life was despaired of. All London was agitated over the\r\nexpected death of the young chemist. Bulletins were prepared by the\r\nphysicians morning, noon, and night, for the scores who came to ask\r\nconcerning him.\r\n\r\nWhen he had recovered and returned to his work, the Royal Institution\r\nprovided him with a voltaic battery of six hundred double plates of four\r\ninches square, four times as powerful as any that had been constructed,\r\nand not long after, one of two thousand plates. Scientific papers were\r\nconstantly coming from his pen. He soon decomposed boracic acid with the\r\nbattery. By heating boron in oxygen, it burnt, and was reconverted into\r\nboracic acid. In his experiments with muriatic acid gas he found\r\nchlorine to be a simple substance, and discovered euchlorine, a compound\r\nof chlorine and oxygen.\r\n\r\nHe had already been made a fellow of the Royal Society at twenty-five,\r\nand at twenty-nine one of the secretaries. His lectures were crowded, as\r\never, by a thousand people. The Dublin Society now invited him to give\r\ncourses of lectures in 1810 and 1811, which he did, ticket-holders each\r\npaying ten dollars for a course. So difficult was it to gain admission\r\nto the lectures that many offered from fifty to a hundred dollars for a\r\ncourse ticket!\r\n\r\nHe writes these facts to his mother, and adds, \"This is merely for your\r\neye: it may please you to know that your son is not unpopular or\r\nuseless. Every person here, from the highest to the lowest, shows me\r\nevery attention and kindness.\r\n\r\n\"I shall come to see you as soon as I can. I hear with infinite delight\r\nof your health, and I hope Heaven will continue to preserve and bless a\r\nmother who deserves so well of her children.\"\r\n\r\nTrinity College, Dublin, conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of\r\nCivil Law. Cuvier said of him: \"Davy, not yet thirty-two, in the opinion\r\nof all who could judge of such labors, held the first rank among the\r\nchemists of this or of any other age.\" The National Institute of France\r\nhad awarded him the prize given by Napoleon to the greatest discovery by\r\nthe means of galvanism.\r\n\r\nAnd yet all this fame and honor had been won by incessant labor. He\r\nwrites to his mother: \"At present, except when I resolve to be idle for\r\nhealth's sake, I devote every moment to labors which I hope will not be\r\nwholly ineffectual in benefiting society, and which will not be wholly\r\ninglorious for my country hereafter; and the feeling of this is the\r\n_reward_ which will continue to keep me employed.\"\r\n\r\nHis brother John, who had been for three years at the Royal Institution,\r\nnow went to Edinburgh to study medicine. Davy writes him: \"Let no\r\ndifficulties alarm you, you may be what you please. Trust me, I know\r\nwhat your powers are. Preserve the dignity of your mind, and the purity\r\nof your moral conduct. You set sail with a fair wind on the ocean of\r\nlife. You have great talents, good feelings, and an unbroken and an\r\nuncorrupted spirit. Move straight forward on to moral and intellectual\r\nexcellence. Let no example induce you to violate decorum,--no ridicule\r\nprevent you from guarding against sensuality or vice. Live in such a way\r\nthat you can always say, the whole world may know what I am doing.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1812 Davy was knighted by the Prince Regent. Only thirty-three, and\r\nhe had come to great renown!\r\n\r\nAnd now an important change was to come into his life. During the\r\npreceding year he had become acquainted with Mrs. Appreece, towards whom\r\nesteem gradually ripened into affection. When their marriage had been\r\ndecided upon, he wrote his mother: \"I am the happiest of men, in the\r\nhope of a union with a woman equally distinguished for virtues, talents,\r\nand accomplishments.... You, I am sure, will sympathize in my happiness.\r\nI believe I should never have married but for this charming woman, whose\r\nviews and whose tastes coincide with my own, and who is eminently\r\nqualified to promote my best efforts and objects in life.\"\r\n\r\nTo his brother he writes: \"I have been very miserable. The lady whom I\r\nlove best of any human beings has been very ill. She is now well, and I\r\nam happy. Mrs. Appreece has consented to marry me: and when the event\r\ntakes place I shall not envy kings, princes, or potentates.... I am\r\ngoing to be married to-morrow; and I have a fair prospect of happiness,\r\nwith the most amiable and intellectual woman I have ever known.\" How\r\nlove idealizes all things, makes a new heaven and a new earth for us! He\r\nfound in her the two needed qualities for happiness; amiability, without\r\nwhich the life of a man is usually made wretched, and intellectuality,\r\nwithout which a cultivated man can have little companionship in a wife.\r\n\r\nThe marriage seems to have been a happy one, for he writes to John\r\nlater: \"Lady D. is a noble creature, and every day adds to my\r\ncontentment by the powers of her understanding, and her amiable and\r\ndelightful tones of feeling.\"\r\n\r\nLike the wife of Herschel, she was a wealthy widow, so that after his\r\nmarriage Davy was enabled to travel, and devote himself wholly to\r\noriginal investigation. He resigned his professorship at the Royal\r\nInstitution after twelve most useful years.\r\n\r\nHis \"Elements of Chemical Philosophy\" was now published, and dedicated\r\nto Lady Davy. After a pleasure trip with his wife to the highlands of\r\nScotland, taking his portable chemical apparatus with him for study,\r\nthey took a journey to France, Italy, Sicily, and Germany, accompanied\r\nby Mr. Michael Faraday, afterward so celebrated, then \"his assistant in\r\nexperiments and writing.\"\r\n\r\nIn Paris, where he spent two months, he discovered that iodine is a\r\nsimple substance, analogous to chlorine. Here he became the intimate\r\nfriend of many distinguished men. \"Humboldt,\" he said, \"was one of the\r\nmost agreeable men I have ever known; social, modest, full of\r\nintelligence, with facilities of every kind; almost _too fluent_ in\r\nconversation. His travels display his spirit of enterprise. His works\r\nare monuments of the variety of his knowledge and resources.\"\r\n\r\nGay-Lussac he placed \"at the head of the living chemists of France.\"\r\n\r\nAt Fontainebleau, on the banks of the Rhone, at Mont Blanc, at Vaucluse,\r\nSir Humphrey's artistic nature voiced itself in song. He had the poet's\r\ntemperament, intense, quick, earnest, ardent, aspiring. He loved\r\nscience, and paid her homage; he loved poetry, and made her his rest and\r\nsolace and soul-companion.\r\n\r\nAt Florence he studied the diamond, and found it merely crystallized\r\ncarbon. At Rome he met Canova, who showed him great attention, and to\r\nwhom he wrote this sonnet:--\r\n\r\n  \"Thou wast a light of brightness in an age\r\n    When Italy was in the night of art:\r\n  She was thy country; but the world thy stage,\r\n    On which thou actedst thy creative part.\r\n  Blameless thy life--thy manners, playful, mild,\r\n  Master in art, but Nature's simplest child.\r\n  Phidias of Rome! like him thou stand'st sublime:\r\n  And after artists shall essay to climb\r\n  To that high temple where thou dwell'st alone,\r\n  Amidst the trophies thou from time hast won.\r\n  Generous to all, but most to rising merit;\r\n  By nobler praise awakening the spirit;\r\n  Yet all unconscious of the eternal fame,\r\n  The light of glory circling round thy name!\"\r\n\r\nAt Milan he met Volta, nearly seventy years old. \"His conversation was\r\nnot brilliant,\" he said; \"his views rather limited, but marking great\r\ningenuity. His manners were perfectly simple.\"\r\n\r\nAround Naples he investigated the phenomena of volcanic eruptions. On\r\nhis return to London they bought a house in Grosvenor Square. He now\r\npublished several papers: \"Experiments and Observations on the Colors\r\nused in Painting by the Ancients\"; \"Experiments on a Solid Compound of\r\nIodine and Oxygen, and on its Chemical Agencies\"; \"Action of Acids on\r\nthe Salts usually called the Hyper-oxymuriates, and on the Gases\r\nproduced from them.\"\r\n\r\nAll his life, besides his ambition to be great, he desired to aid his\r\nfellow-men, and in the year 1815 he made a discovery which placed him\r\namong the benefactors of the race. In 1812 a terrible explosion of gas\r\nhad taken place in a mine, causing the death of nearly a hundred men.\r\nThe mine was on fire, and the mouth had to be closed, thus bringing sure\r\ndeath to the poor creatures within. Such accidents were so frequent,\r\nthat a committee of mine proprietors visited the great chemist, to see\r\nif science could suggest a remedy.\r\n\r\nHe at once visited several mines, investigated fire-damp, and found it\r\nto be light carburetted hydrogen. After a long and careful series of\r\nexperiments through several months, he invented the safety-lamp, \"a cage\r\nof wire gauze, which actually made prisoner the flame of the fire-damp,\r\nand in its prison consumed it; and whilst it confined the dangerous\r\nexplosive flame, it permitted air to pass and light to escape; and\r\nthough, from the combustion of the fire-damp, the cage might become red\r\nhot, yet still it acted the part of a safety-lamp.\"\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey at thirty-seven had immortalized himself. At a public\r\ndinner given in his honor at Newcastle, a service of plate worth over\r\ntwelve thousand dollars was presented to him. After his death this\r\nservice was given to the Royal Society by his widow, to be sold, and\r\nthe proceeds applied to the encouragement of science. Emperor Alexander\r\nof Russia sent him a splendid silver-gilt vase, with a personal letter;\r\nhis own sovereign conferred a baronetcy upon him.\r\n\r\nWhen Davy was urged by some friends to take out a patent upon the\r\nsafety-lamp, and thus make five or ten thousand a year for himself, he\r\nsaid, \"I never thought of such a thing: my sole object was to serve the\r\ncause of humanity; and if I have succeeded, I am amply rewarded in the\r\ngratifying reflection of having done so. I have enough for all my views\r\nand purposes; more wealth could not increase either my fame or my\r\nhappiness. It might undoubtedly enable me to put four horses to my\r\ncarriage; but what would it avail me to have it said that Sir Humphrey\r\ndrives his carriage and four?\"\r\n\r\nHe said later of his discovery of the safety-lamp: \"I value it more than\r\nanything I ever did: it was the result of a great deal of investigation\r\nand labor; but if my directions be attended to, it will save the lives\r\nof thousands of poor men. I was never more affected than by a written\r\naddress which I received from the working colliers when I was in the\r\nNorth, thanking me on behalf of themselves and their families for the\r\npreservation of their lives.\"\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey used to say: \"Whoever wishes to enjoy _peace_, and is\r\ngifted with great talents, must labor for posterity. In doing this he\r\nenjoys all the pleasures of intellectual labor, and all the desire\r\narising from protracted hope. He feels no envy nor jealousy; his mark is\r\ntoo far distant to be seen by short-sighted malevolence, and therefore\r\nit is never aimed at.... To raise a chestnut on the mountain, or a palm\r\nin the plain, which may afford shade, shelter, and fruit for generations\r\nyet unborn, and which, if they have once fixed their roots, require no\r\nculture, is better than to raise annual flowers in a garden, which must\r\nbe watered daily, and in which a cold wind may chill or too ardent a\r\nsunshine may dry.... The best faculties of man are employed for\r\nfuturity: speaking is better than acting, writing is better than\r\nspeaking.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1818 he took his second continental journey with his\r\nwife, going through Austria, Germany, and Italy. Commissioned by his\r\nking, he made some researches on Herculaneum manuscripts.\r\n\r\nOn his return to England he was made President of the Royal Society, the\r\nposition so ably filled by Sir Isaac Newton. Every Saturday evening,\r\npoets, artists, and men of science gathered at his receptions. This\r\noffice he held for seven years, till his declining health compelled his\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1821, Davy paid a visit to his old home in Penzance, and\r\nsaw his mother for the last time before her death. A public dinner was\r\ngiven him by his townsmen, which honor he greatly appreciated. He was no\r\nlonger the poor lad among them. \"Every heart, tongue, and eye were as\r\none to do honor to him who had not only rendered the name of their\r\n_town_ famous and imperishable as science itself, but who had added\r\nlustre to the intellectual character of their _country_.\"\r\n\r\nFrom year to year he continued his experiments. Urged by the\r\ncommissioners of the navy to remedy the corrosion of copper sheathing on\r\nvessels by sea water, he succeeded in rendering the copper negatively\r\nelectrical by small pieces of tin, zinc, or iron nails. Shells and\r\nseaweeds adhered to the non-corroded surface, but the principle of\r\ngalvanic protection has been applied to various important uses.\r\n\r\nIn 1824, Sir Humphrey took a journey to Norway, Sweden, and Denmark,\r\nvisiting Berzelius of Sweden, \"one of the great ornaments of the age,\"\r\nhe said, and Oersted of Denmark, distinguished for his discovery of\r\nelectro-magnetism.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of 1826, when he was only forty-eight, Davy was\r\nattacked by paralysis in the right side, having suffered for a year with\r\nnumbness and pain in his right arm. During his confinement in his room,\r\nhe corrected the proof sheets of his \"Discourses to the Royal Society,\"\r\npublished in January, 1827.\r\n\r\nIn this year, having improved, he went through France, Italy, and\r\nSwitzerland, hunting and fishing as in his boyhood, and writing\r\n\"Salmonia, or Days of Fly Fishing,\" giving descriptions of his journey\r\nand his observations on natural history.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1828, he made another journey, to Southern Austria,\r\nspending the winter in Italy, and writing his \"Consolation in Travel,\"\r\nwhich Cuvier called the work of a dying Plato. \"I was desirous,\" he\r\nsays, \"of again passing some time in these scenes, in the hope of\r\nreestablishing a broken constitution; and though this hope was a feeble\r\none, yet, at least, I expected to spend a few of the last days of life\r\nmore tranquilly and more agreeably than in the metropolis of my own\r\ncountry. Nature never deceives us. The rocks, the mountains, the\r\nstreams, always speak the same language. A shower of snow may hide the\r\nverdant woods in spring; a thunder storm may render the blue limpid\r\nstreams foul and turbulent: but these effects are rare and transient; in\r\na few hours, or at least days, all the sources of beauty are renovated;\r\nand Nature affords no continued trains of misfortunes and miseries, such\r\nas depend upon the constitution of humanity,--no hopes forever blighted\r\nin the bud,--no beings full of life, beauty, and promise, taken from us\r\nin the prime of youth. Her fruits are all balmy, bright, and sweet; she\r\naffords none of those blighted ones so common in the life of man, and so\r\nlike the fabled apples of the Dead Sea,--fresh and beautiful to the\r\nsight, but, when tasted, full of bitterness and ashes.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Rome he writes to a friend, a year later, in the spring of 1829: \"I\r\nam here _wearing away_ the winter,--a ruin amongst ruins!... I fight\r\nagainst sickness and fate, believing I have still duties to perform, and\r\nthat even my illness is connected in some way with my being made useful\r\nto my fellow-creatures. I have this conviction full on my mind, that\r\nintellectual beings spring from the same breath of infinite\r\nintelligence, and return to it again, but by different courses. Like\r\nrivers born amidst the clouds of heaven, and lost in the deep and\r\neternal ocean,--some in youth, rapid and short-lived torrents; some in\r\nmanhood, powerful and copious rivers; and some in age, by a winding and\r\nslow course, half lost in their career, and making their exit by many\r\nsandy and shallow mouths.\"\r\n\r\nDavy was destined to go back to the Infinite Intelligence in manhood, \"a\r\npowerful and copious river,\" however much he \"fought against sickness\r\nand fate.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 23, 1829, he dictated a letter to his brother John: \"I am\r\ndying from a severe attack of palsy, which has seized the whole body,\r\nwith the exception of the intellectual organ.\" He added in his own hand,\r\njust legible, \"Come as quickly as possible.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the brother arrived, and was overcome with grief, Sir Humphrey\r\nreceived him with a cheerful smile, and bade him not to grieve, but\r\nconsider the event like a philosopher. He talked more earnestly than\r\never, and his mind seemed all aglow as with the brilliancy of a setting\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nAt one time he was so near death, that he said \"he had gone through the\r\nwhole process of dying, and that when he awoke he had difficulty in\r\nconvincing himself that he was in his earthly existence.\" Reviving\r\nsomewhat, they journeyed from Italy to Geneva, by slow and easy travel,\r\narriving May 28, 1829. In the night, at half-past two, Sir Humphrey was\r\ntaken very ill, and died almost immediately.\r\n\r\nHe was buried June 1, in the cemetery outside the walls of the city,\r\nhaving requested to be interred where he died, without any display. The\r\ngrave is marked by a simple monument erected by his wife. She also\r\nfounded a prize in his honor, to be given every two years, for the most\r\noriginal and important discovery in chemical science. Only fifty, and\r\nhis work finished,--no not finished,--for his books and his discoveries,\r\nhis character, with its earnest perseverance, its tenderness, its\r\nsympathy, its noble aspirations, and its helpfulness to mankind, will\r\nlive forever!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN JAMES AUDUBON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN JAMES AUDUBON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem why certain men and women come to eminence, and why others,\r\nwith apparently as much ability, remain forever in obscurity, is an\r\ninteresting one to solve. Most persons desire fame; most persons desire\r\nwealth; but, for one reason or another, thousands fail to achieve what\r\nthey desire. They lack either singleness of aim, or adequate\r\nperseverance, or determined will, or sound judgment, or, instead of\r\nmastering circumstances, they permit circumstances to master them.\r\n\r\nIt is so easy to be turned aside in life by trivial matters; to be\r\ninterested in our neighbor's wedding, or our neighbor's profits and\r\nlosses. Those who oversee the affairs of others rarely oversee their\r\nown. Men become very busy over clubs and pastimes; women, over social\r\ngatherings and appearance, and die with little accomplished.\r\n\r\nAudubon's life furnishes a unique illustration of the result of having a\r\ndefinite purpose, and bending all one's energies to it, till success is\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nJohn James Audubon was born at New Orleans, May 4, 1780, in the land of\r\norange groves and magnolias, of birds and sunshine. His grandfather was\r\na poor fisherman of La Vendee, France, with twenty-one children. Unable\r\nto support them, they made their way in life as best they could.\r\n\r\nWhen John's father was twelve years old, the fisherman gave him \"a\r\nshirt, a dress of warm clothing, his blessing, and a cane, and sent him\r\nout to seek his fortune.\" He went to Nantes, shipped before the mast; at\r\ntwenty-one commanded a vessel, and at twenty-five was owner and captain\r\nof a small craft.\r\n\r\nGoing to St. Domingo, West Indies, he purchased a small estate.\r\nAmbitious, as are all persons who succeed, he soon secured an\r\nappointment from the Governor of St. Domingo, returned to France, made\r\nthe acquaintance of influential men, and obtained an appointment in the\r\nImperial navy, with the command of a small vessel of war.\r\n\r\nHe had what all persons need, true self-appreciation; quite another\r\nquality from self-conceit. To believe that we can do things, having kept\r\nour characters such that we respect ourselves, is a strong indication\r\nthat we shall prosper if we make the attempt.\r\n\r\nFrequently visiting America in his ship, Audubon purchased land in\r\nLouisiana, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. In the former State he married a\r\nlady of Spanish extraction, Anne Moynette, both beautiful and wealthy.\r\nOf their three sons and one daughter, John James was the youngest son.\r\n\r\nThe mother was not spared to rear the distinguished naturalist, but\r\nperished a few years after his birth, in the insurrection of the colored\r\npeople of St. Domingo. The father, having purchased a beautiful estate\r\non the Loire, nine miles from Nantes, married a second time, a woman who\r\nproved a most indulgent mother to her husband's children. Having none of\r\nher own, she humored John in every way, and allowed him to gather moss,\r\ncurious stones, birds' nests,--indeed, everything which belongs to\r\nnatural history,--to his heart's content.\r\n\r\nOn the return of Commodore Audubon to France, finding that the boy was\r\nfollowing the bent of his own mind, to the neglect of a solid education,\r\nin spite of the tears and entreaties of his wife, he sent him away to\r\nschool. For a year John was obliged to apply himself closely to\r\nmathematics, taking a ramble to collect specimens whenever it was\r\npossible. He studied drawing under the celebrated painter David, and\r\nlearned to play well on the violin, flute, flageolet, and guitar.\r\n\r\nHis father had hoped that he would become a soldier under Napoleon, but\r\na lad who could lie on his back under a tree for three weeks, and watch\r\nwith a telescope the habits of some little gray birds of the color of\r\nthe bark of the tree, would not care much for the smoke and din of\r\nbattle. He was therefore sent to America, to look after his father's\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nWith a heavy heart the youth said good-by to France, where he had\r\nalready sketched two hundred varieties of birds from life. Arriving in\r\nNew York, he became ill of yellow fever, and was carried to the home of\r\ntwo Quaker ladies in Morristown, whose kindness doubtless saved his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhen he had recovered, he went to his father's farm at Mill Grove, near\r\nthe Schuylkill Falls, Pennsylvania, and found, as he said, \"a blessed\r\nspot.\" He was free, now, to study natural history; no more mathematics;\r\nno more urging to become a soldier. He was delighted with the mill\r\nattached to the property, and with the pewees who built their nests near\r\nby. \"Hunting, fishing, and drawing occupied my every moment,\" he says;\r\n\"cares I knew not, and cared nothing for them.\"\r\n\r\nAn English gentleman, William Bakewell, descended from the Peverils of\r\nDerbyshire, rendered historical by Scott's novel \"Peveril of the Peak,\"\r\nowned the adjoining property. Audubon, being French, did not court the\r\nacquaintance of the Englishman, indeed avoided him, till one day, as he\r\nwas following some grouse down the creek in winter, he met Mr. Bakewell.\r\n\r\n\"I was struck with the kind politeness of his manners,\" says Audubon,\r\n\"and found him a most expert marksman, and entered into conversation. I\r\nadmired the beauty of his well trained dogs, and finally promised to\r\ncall upon him and his family. Well do I recollect the morning, and may\r\nit please God may I never forget it, when for the first time I entered\r\nthe Bakewell household. It happened that Mr. Bakewell was from home. I\r\nwas shown into a parlor, where only one young lady was snugly seated at\r\nwork, with her back turned towards the fire. She rose on my entrance,\r\noffered me a seat, and assured me of the gratification her father would\r\nfeel on his return; which, she added with a smile, would be in a few\r\nminutes, as she would send a servant after him. Other ruddy cheeks made\r\ntheir appearance, but, like spirits gay, vanished from my sight. Talking\r\nand working, the young lady who remained made the time pass pleasantly\r\nenough, and to me especially so. It was she, my dear Lucy Bakewell, who\r\nafterwards became my wife, and the mother of my children.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bakewell soon returned, and lunch was provided before leaving on a\r\nshooting expedition. \"Lucy rose from her seat a second time, and her\r\nform, to which I had before paid little attention, seemed radiant with\r\nbeauty, and my heart and eyes followed her every step. The repast being\r\nover, guns and dogs were provided, and as we left I was pleased to\r\nbelieve that Lucy looked upon me as a not very strange animal. Bowing to\r\nher, I felt, I knew not why, that I was at least not indifferent to\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nThus was begun a beautiful affection that ran like a thread of gold\r\nthrough the darkness and light of two struggling lives. The friendship\r\nincreased as the months went by, for the youth, alone in a strange\r\ncountry, devoted to his foster-mother, needed a woman's love and\r\ntenderness to cheer him. Lucy Bakewell taught Audubon English, and he\r\nin return gave her drawing lessons.\r\n\r\nAt Mill Grove the weeks passed pleasantly,--is not the world always\r\nbeautiful when we love somebody? Audubon says in his journal: \"I had no\r\nvices; but was thoughtless, pensive, loving, fond of shooting, fishing,\r\nand riding, and had a passion for raising all sorts of fowls, which\r\nsources of interest and amusement fully occupied my time.... I ate no\r\nbutcher's meat, lived chiefly on fruits, vegetables, and fish, and never\r\ndrank a glass of spirits or wine until my wedding day. To this I\r\nattribute my continual good health, endurance, and an iron\r\nconstitution.\"\r\n\r\nHere at Mill Grove, while yet a boy, he planned his great work, the\r\n\"Birds of America,\" their habits, and a description of them. This one\r\nidea dominated Audubon's life. Through poverty and suffering, this one\r\ndesire was ever before him. It is well to plan early in life what we\r\nwish to do, and then _do it_.\r\n\r\nOne writer has well said of Audubon: \"For sixty years or more he\r\nfollowed, with more than religious devotion, a beautiful and devoted\r\npursuit, enlarging its boundaries by his discoveries, and illustrating\r\nits objects by his art. In all climates and in all weathers; scorched by\r\nburning suns, drenched by piercing rains, frozen by the fiercest colds:\r\nnow diving fearlessly into the densest forest, now wandering alone over\r\nthe most savage regions; in perils, in difficulties, and in doubts;\r\nwith no companion to cheer his way, far from the smiles and applause of\r\nsociety; listening only to the sweet music of birds, or to the sweeter\r\nmusic of his own thoughts, he faithfully kept his path.\r\n\r\n\"The records of man's life contain few nobler examples of strength of\r\npurpose and indefatigable energy. Led on solely by his pure, lofty,\r\nkindling enthusiasm, no thirst for wealth, no desire of distinction, no\r\nrestless ambition of eccentric character, could have induced him to\r\nundergo as many sacrifices, or sustained him under so many trials.\r\nHigher principles and worthier motives alone enabled him to meet such\r\ndiscouragements and accomplish such miracles of achievement. He has\r\nenlarged and enriched the domains of a pleasing and useful science; he\r\nhas revealed to us the existence of many species of birds before\r\nunknown; he has given us more accurate information of the forms and\r\nhabits of those that were known; he has corrected the blunders of his\r\npredecessors; and he has imparted to the study of natural history the\r\ngrace and fascination of romance.\"\r\n\r\nAt Mill Grove he came near losing his life, on a duck-shooting\r\nexpedition, by falling through an air hole in the ice. It was three\r\nmonths before he recovered.\r\n\r\nAt this time \"a partner, tutor, and monitor,\" Da Costa, whom Audubon's\r\nfather had sent over to superintend a lead-mine enterprise at Mill\r\nGrove, refused to give money to the son and objected to his marrying\r\nLucy Bakewell. Resenting the dictation of Da Costa, young Audubon\r\ndetermined to go to France and lay the matter before his father. Da\r\nCosta would give him no money, but a letter of credit upon an agent in\r\nNew York. The youth, nothing daunted, walked all the way to New York,\r\nwas refused the money by the agent, who hinted that the lad should be\r\nseized and shipped to China, borrowed his passage money, went to France,\r\ncaused the removal of Da Costa, and obtained his father's consent to his\r\nmarriage. For a year he resided at Nantes, shooting, stuffing birds, and\r\ndrawing for his beloved book. Then all Frenchmen being liable to\r\nconscription under Napoleon, the Commodore obtained leave for his son to\r\nreturn to America.\r\n\r\nOnce again he was at his dear Mill Grove. In his room \"the walls were\r\nfestooned with all sorts of birds' eggs, carefully blown out and strung\r\non a thread. The chimney piece was covered with stuffed squirrels,\r\nraccoons, and opossums, and the shelves around were likewise crowded\r\nwith specimens, among which were fishes, frogs, snakes, lizards and\r\nother reptiles.\"\r\n\r\nLucy's father, concluding that the study of natural history might not\r\nbring pecuniary support for his daughter, suggested to Audubon that he\r\nobtain some knowledge of commercial pursuits. Love seldom asks about\r\nways and means; too seldom, in fact, for subsequent happiness. Audubon\r\nentered the counting-house of Mr. Benjamin Bakewell of New York, and\r\nsoon lost some hundreds of pounds by a bad speculation in indigo. The\r\ndrying of bird's skins in his rooms was so disagreeable to his neighbors\r\nthat a message was sent him, through a constable, insisting on his\r\nabating the _nuisance_!\r\n\r\nFinance did not seem the specialty of the young man, and he returned to\r\nMill Grove.\r\n\r\nDear as the place was to him, he sold it, invested the capital in goods,\r\nmarried Lucy Bakewell, April 8, 1808, when he was twenty-eight years\r\nold, and started for the West. They were twelve days in sailing down the\r\nOhio River in a flat-bottomed float, called an ark. He engaged in trade\r\nat Louisville, and the young couple were extremely happy. Fortunate it\r\nwas that they had these few months of comfort, for hardship was soon to\r\ntest their affection.\r\n\r\nThe war of 1812 so crippled business that he and his partner decided to\r\ngo to Hendersonville, while Lucy and her infant son went home to her\r\nfather for a year. If Mr. Bakewell ever regretted the choice which his\r\ndaughter had made, she did not, and never failed, when days were\r\ndarkest, to encourage him to write and win renown. When all others\r\nbemoaned his lack of business success, and his devotion to a non-paying\r\npursuit, she alone was his comforter, and was willing to suffer poverty\r\nif thus his great work might be done.\r\n\r\nThere was no success at Hendersonville, and the goods were taken to St.\r\nGenevieve. Here the partner married, and Audubon sold his interest to\r\nhim, purchased a horse, and started across the country to see his wife,\r\nwho had meantime come back from Pennsylvania to Hendersonville, Ky. In\r\nthis trip he came near losing his life. He says: \"I found myself obliged\r\nto cross one of the wild prairies which, in that portion of the United\r\nStates, vary the appearance of the country. The weather was fine, all\r\naround me was as fresh and blooming as if it had just issued from the\r\nbosom of nature. My knapsack, my gun, and my dog were all I had for\r\nbaggage and company. But although well moccasined, I moved slowly along,\r\nattracted by the brilliancy of the flowers, and the gambols of the fawns\r\naround their dams, to all appearance as thoughtless of danger as I felt\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nAfter travelling all day, he reached a log cabin. \"Presenting myself at\r\nthe door, I asked the tall figure, which proved to be a woman, if I\r\nmight take shelter under her roof for the night. Her voice was gruff,\r\nand her dress negligently thrown about her. She answered in the\r\naffirmative. I walked in, took a wooden stool, and quietly seated myself\r\nby the fire. The next object that attracted my notice was a finely\r\nformed young Indian, resting his head between his hands, with his elbows\r\non his knees. A long bow rested against the log wall near him, while a\r\nquantity of arrows and two or three raccoon skins lay at his feet. He\r\nmoved not; he apparently breathed not. Accustomed to the habits of the\r\nIndians, and knowing that they pay little attention to the approach of\r\ncivilized strangers, I addressed him in French,--a language not\r\nunfrequently partially known to the people of that neighborhood. He\r\nraised his head, pointed to one of his eyes with his finger, and gave me\r\na significant glance with the other; his face was covered with blood.\r\n\r\n\"The fact was, that an hour before this, as he was in the act of\r\ndischarging an arrow at a raccoon in the top of a tree, the arrow had\r\nsplit upon the cord, and sprung back with such violence into his right\r\neye as to destroy it forever.\r\n\r\n\"Feeling hungry, I inquired what sort of fare I might expect. Such a\r\nthing as a bed was not to be seen; but many large, untanned buffalo\r\nhides lay piled in a corner. I drew a time-piece from my pocket, and\r\ntold the woman that it was late, and that I was fatigued. She espied my\r\nwatch, the richness of which seemed to operate on her feelings with\r\nelectric quickness. She told me there was plenty of venison and jerked\r\nbuffalo meat, and that on removing the ashes I should find a cake. But\r\nmy watch had struck her fancy, and her curiosity had to be gratified by\r\nan immediate sight of it. I took off the gold chain which secured it\r\naround my neck, and presented it to her. She was all ecstasy, spoke of\r\nits beauty, asked me its value, and put the chain round her brawny neck,\r\nsaying how happy the possession of such a watch would make her.\r\nThoughtless, and, as I fancied myself, in so retired a spot, secure, I\r\npaid little attention to her talk or her movements. I helped my dog to a\r\ngood supper of venison, and was not long in satisfying the demands of\r\nmy own appetite.\r\n\r\n\"The Indian rose from his seat as if in extreme suffering. He passed and\r\nrepassed me several times, and once pinched me on the side so violently,\r\nthat the pain nearly brought forth an exclamation of anger. I looked at\r\nhim; his eye met mine, but his look was so forbidding that it struck a\r\nchill into the more nervous part of my system. He again seated himself,\r\ndrew his butcher-knife from its greasy scabbard, examined its edge, as I\r\nwould do that of a razor suspected dull, replaced it, and, again taking\r\nhis tomahawk from his back filled the pipe of it with tobacco, and sent\r\nme expressive glances whenever our hostess chanced to have her back\r\ntowards us.\"\r\n\r\nAudubon now perceived his danger. \"I asked the woman for my watch, wound\r\nit up, and, under the pretence of wishing to see how the weather might\r\nprobably be on the morrow, took up my gun, and walked out of the cabin.\r\nI slipped a ball into each barrel, scraped the edges of my flints,\r\nrenewed the primings, and, returning to the hut, gave a favorable\r\naccount of my observations. I took a few bear-skins, made a pallet of\r\nthem, and, calling my faithful dog to my side, lay down, with my gun\r\nclose to my body, and in a few minutes was, to all appearance, fast\r\nasleep.\"\r\n\r\nSoon two young, stalwart Indians arrived at the cabin, bearing a dead\r\nstag on a pole. These were the Indian woman's sons. She and they drank\r\nwhiskey, and then took a large carving-knife to a grindstone, and\r\nsharpened it. \"I saw her pour the water on the turning machine,\" says\r\nAudubon, \"and watched her working away with the dangerous instrument,\r\nuntil the cold sweat covered every part of my body, in despite of my\r\ndetermination to defend myself to the last. Her task finished, she\r\nwalked to her reeling sons, and said, 'There, that'll soon settle him!\r\nBoys, kill you--and then for the watch!'\"\r\n\r\nJust at this moment the door suddenly opened, and two travellers\r\nentered. The mother and her sons were bound, and Audubon's life was\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at last at Hendersonville, and soon went into business with a\r\nbrother-in-law at New Orleans. He embarked all the fortune at his\r\ndisposal, and lost it all.\r\n\r\nHis father had already died, leaving Audubon an estate in France, and\r\nseventeen thousand dollars deposited with a merchant in Richmond, Va.\r\nThe merchant died insolvent, and Audubon never received a dollar. He\r\nmade no effort to possess the property in France, and years afterwards\r\nit was transferred to his sister Rosa. He now began to feel anxious\r\nabout the future. A second son, John, had been born to him, and he must\r\ntry once more to earn in business. Gathering a few hundred dollars, he\r\npurchased some goods in Louisville, and returned to Hendersonville. A\r\nformer partner joined him, advised erecting a steam mill, which was\r\ndone. Several men invested capital in the enterprise, and a complete\r\nfailure resulted. Audubon gave up all the property he possessed to his\r\ncreditors, and left Hendersonville with his sick wife, his gun, his dog,\r\nand his drawings.\r\n\r\nThey reached Louisville, and were kindly received by a relative. How\r\ncould he support his family? The outlook was not hopeful. He would try\r\nmaking crayon portraits. He succeeded so well that a farmer came in the\r\nmiddle of the night to request a picture of his mother before she died,\r\nand the work was done by candle-light.\r\n\r\nInvited to Cincinnati to become curator of the museum, Audubon accepted,\r\nand opened a drawing-school in that city. But very little money\r\nresulted, and he resolved to seek a new field of labor. Getting letters\r\nof recommendation from General, afterwards President, Harrison, and from\r\nHenry Clay, he started, October 12, 1820, for New Orleans. Stopping for\r\na time at Natchez, he and a companion found themselves destitute of\r\nshoes. Going to a shoemaker, he asked to sketch a crayon portrait of\r\nhimself and his wife in return for two pairs of boots. The offer was\r\naccepted, and Audubon and his friend found themselves again in suitable\r\ncondition for travelling. How different all this from the former easy\r\nlife at Mill Grove!\r\n\r\nArriving at New Orleans, what little money he possessed was stolen, he\r\ncould find no work, and he was obliged to live on the boat in which he\r\nhad come thither. He writes in his journal: \"Time passed sadly in\r\nseeking ineffectually for employment. I was fortunate in making a hit\r\nwith the portrait of a well known citizen of New Orleans. I showed it to\r\nthe public; it made a favorable impression, and I obtained several\r\npatrons. A few orders for portraits relieved my necessities, and,\r\ncontinuing my work of painting birds, the time passed more pleasantly.\"\r\n\r\nHe was always planning for wider opportunities to study birds for his\r\nbook. In the midst of his dire poverty, he did not forget this. Now he\r\nhoped to join the expedition which surveyed the boundary line of the\r\nterritory ceded to the United States by Spain, and he says, \"Saw nothing\r\nbut hundreds of new birds in imagination within range of my gun.\" But\r\nthis, like other plans, came to naught, for poverty binds with strong\r\ncords, and it requires almost superhuman strength to break them.\r\n\r\nAt last, in the family of Mrs. Perrie, who owned a plantation at Bayou\r\nSara, in Louisiana, he obtained a situation. He was to teach drawing to\r\nher daughter for sixty dollars a month, having his afternoons for his\r\nwork. Her desire was, under the guise of employment, to help the poor\r\nnaturalist.\r\n\r\nAfter fourteen months since leaving Cincinnati, during which time, he\r\nsays, \"I have finished sixty-two drawing of birds and plants, three\r\nquadrupeds, two snakes, fifty portraits of all sorts, and have subsisted\r\nby my humble talents, not having had a dollar when I started,\" he sent\r\nfor his family to come to him. A house was rented on Dauphine Street, at\r\nseventeen dollars a month. Now if they starved, they would starve\r\ntogether. Being asked to join in painting a panorama of the city, he\r\nsaid, \"My birds, my beloved birds of America, occupy all my time, and\r\nnearly all my thoughts, and I do not wish to see any other perspective\r\nthan the last specimen of these drawings.\" He was now forty-two, and\r\nlife was none too long, at the best. No wonder he was anxious about his\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nDuring the first months of 1822, after his family came, there are no\r\nrecords of his life. He was too poor to buy a journal. Mrs. Audubon had\r\nfound a situation as governess in a family. Audubon was depressed in\r\nspirits, and poor health was the result. If some person with wealth had\r\nonly been wise enough to have helped the man of talent! We build\r\ncolleges and churches, and this is well; but often neglect the brilliant\r\nman or woman near our own door, who might bless the world. Brains do not\r\nalways win pecuniary success. We sometimes go to extremes in America by\r\nadvocating self-dependence, and let a refined and sensitive soul break\r\nbecause it cannot breast the world. We forget that on earth we are to be\r\nour brother's keeper. Perchance we shall remember it beyond!\r\n\r\nFinally Audubon left New Orleans, procuring passage on a boat to\r\nNatchez, by a crayon portrait of the captain and his wife. In the family\r\nof a Portuguese gentleman in that city, he taught drawing, music, and\r\nFrench, and also drawing in a college nine miles from Natchez, but he\r\nwas still depressed. \"While work flowed in upon me,\" he says, \"the hope\r\nof my completing my book upon the birds of America became less clear;\r\nand, full of despair, I feared my hopes of becoming known to Europe as a\r\nnaturalist were destined to be blasted.\"\r\n\r\nTo feel within one's breast the aspiration which is God-given,\r\nand know that one has genius, and yet be bound hand and foot by\r\ncircumstances,--what is harder?\r\n\r\nPoor Audubon! with his lessening hope of \"becoming known to Europe.\" His\r\nwife had come to Natchez and obtained a position as teacher, similar to\r\nthe one she had held in New Orleans. Poverty had tested their love, but\r\nit had stood the test. Audubon had made a copy of the \"Death of\r\nMontgomery;\" and for this friends raffled, and gave him the proceeds,\r\nthree hundred dollars, and the picture also.\r\n\r\nMrs. Audubon now made an engagement with a lady at Bayou Sara, to teach\r\nher children with her own, and a limited number of pupils. Seeing that\r\nhis family would now be provided for, \"I determined,\" he says, \"to break\r\nthrough all bonds, and pursue my ornithological pursuits. My best\r\nfriends solemnly regarded me as a madman, and my wife and family alone\r\ngave me encouragement. My wife determined that my genius should prevail,\r\nand that my final success as an ornithologist should be triumphant.\"\r\n\r\nBlessed faith of woman! Giving a love that knows only self-sacrifice;\r\nthat braves all, bears all, and finally wins all for its beloved\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThe oldest son, Victor, was placed in the counting-house of a friend at\r\nLouisville, and Audubon sought Philadelphia, \"as a desperate venture,\"\r\nhe says, to see if means could not be obtained to further his work. He\r\ntook a room, and began to give lessons in drawing. He said plaintively\r\nin his journal, \"I have now been twenty-five years pursuing my\r\nornithological studies,\" and yet the book was not written. Fortunately\r\nhe obtained a letter of introduction to the portrait-painter Sully, \"a\r\nman after my own heart, and who showed me great kindnesses.\" He gave\r\nAudubon instruction in oil, and would take no pay for it, and the\r\nnaturalist was \"overwhelmed with his goodness.\" Audubon found another\r\nwarm-hearted friend,--Edward Harris,--a young ornithologist, who, as he\r\nwas bidding Audubon good-by, squeezed a hundred-dollar bill into his\r\nhand, saying, \"Mr. Audubon, accept this from me; men like you ought not\r\nto want for money.\" \"I could only express my gratitude,\" says Audubon,\r\n\"by insisting on his receiving the drawings of all my French birds,\r\nwhich he did, and I was relieved.\"\r\n\r\nA friend now took him to visit Mill Grove. \"As we entered the avenue\r\nleading to Mill Grove,\" he says, \"every step brought to my mind the\r\nmemory of past years, and I was bewildered by the recollections until we\r\nreached the door of the house, which had once been the residence of my\r\nfather as well as myself.... After resting a few moments, I abruptly\r\ntook my hat, and ran wildly towards the woods, to the grotto where I\r\nfirst heard from my wife the acknowledgment that she was not indifferent\r\nto me. It had been torn down, and some stones carted away; but, raising\r\nmy eyes toward heaven, I repeated the promise we had mutually made. We\r\ndined at Mill Grove, and as I entered the parlor I stood motionless, for\r\na moment, on the spot where my wife and myself were forever joined.\"\r\n\r\nHe then went to New York, and a friend took him to the Lyceum. \"My\r\nportfolio was examined by the members of the Institute,\" he says, \"among\r\nwhom I felt awkward and uncomfortable. After living among such people, I\r\nfeel clouded and depressed; remember that I have done nothing, and fear\r\nI may die unknown, I feel I am strange to all but the birds of America.\r\nIn a few days I shall be in the woods, and quite forgotten.\" The next\r\nday, he writes in his journal: \"My spirits low, and I long for the woods\r\nagain; but the prospect of becoming known prompts me to remain another\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this city he journeyed West. \"All trembling I reached the Falls of\r\nNiagara, and oh, what a scene! My blood shudders still, although I am\r\nnot a coward, at the grandeur of the Creator's power; and I gazed\r\nmotionless on this new display of the irresistible force of one of his\r\nelements.\"\r\n\r\nAt Buffalo, he took a deck-passage on board a schooner bound for Erie,\r\nusing his buffalo-robe and blanket to sleep on. At Pittsburg, he spent\r\na month scouring the country for birds, and continued his drawings.\r\nArriving at Cincinnati, he says, \"I was beset by claims for the payment\r\nof articles which years before had been ordered for the Museum, but from\r\nwhich I got no benefit. Without money, or the means of making it, I\r\napplied to Messrs. Keating and Bell for the loan of fifteen dollars; but\r\nhad not the courage to do so until I had walked past their house several\r\ntimes, unable to make up my mind how to ask the favor. I got the loan\r\ncheerfully, and took a deck-passage to Louisville. I was allowed to take\r\nmy meals in the cabin, and at night slept among some shavings I managed\r\nto scrape together. The spirit of contentment which I now feel is\r\nstrange; it borders on the sublime; and, enthusiast or lunatic, as some\r\nof my relatives will have me, I am glad to possess such a spirit.\"\r\n\r\nAt last he reached Bayou Sara, and saw his wife; \"and, holding and\r\nkissing her, I was once more happy, and all my toils and trials were\r\nforgotten.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Audubon had been extremely fortunate. She was earning nearly three\r\nthousand dollars a year. This she offered to her husband to help the\r\npublication of the book. He was invited to teach dancing, and a class of\r\nsixty was soon organized. From this source he received about two\r\nthousand dollars. The tide of fortune had turned at last, and he began\r\nto prepare for a trip to England. He was forty-six. Life had been indeed\r\na struggle. He had wandered over the country, with scanty food and poor\r\nattire, always in debt, but he had drawn his birds; and now the money\r\nwas actually in his hands, whereby he could, perhaps, \"be known in\r\nEurope.\" And Lucy Audubon had made it possible!\r\n\r\nHe had gained much by his trials. He had learned what most of us take a\r\nlife-time to learn, patience; not to speak harshly when others are\r\nharsh. He said, \"To repay evils with kindness is the religion I was\r\ntaught to practice, and this will forever be my rule.\" He had learned\r\nthat much in life is trivial, that most things are \"not matters of life\r\nand death;\" little worries come to all, and can be borne--the momentous\r\nthings of life are really few.\r\n\r\nApril 26, 1826, Audubon sailed for England. Arriving at Liverpool, he\r\nwas able to arrange for the display of his drawings at the Liverpool\r\nExhibition. The entrance fee was one shilling, and the receipts were\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty dollars a day. Surely fame was coming at last.\r\nLord Stanley spent five hours in examining the collection, and said,\r\n\"This work is unique, and deserves the patronage of the Crown.\" He\r\ninvited Audubon to visit him at his town house in Grosvenor Square. The\r\nnaturalist made portraits of various friends who were desirous of\r\nobtaining specimens of his drawing. From the exhibition of his pictures\r\nin Liverpool he realized five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nFrom this city he went to Manchester, and from thence to Edinburgh.\r\nHere he met the naturalist Professor Jameson, who promised to introduce\r\nhis book to the public in his \"Natural History Magazine.\" Professor\r\nWilson (Christopher North) volunteered to introduce Audubon to Sir\r\nWalter Scott. Audubon was asked to sit for his portrait. The Royal\r\nInstitution offered their rooms for the exhibition of his drawings, and\r\nthe receipts were from twenty-five to seventy-five dollars a day.\r\n\r\nTruly things had changed, since those desolate days in America, when he\r\nslept on the deck of a steamboat, because unable to pay for a bed, and\r\ncould not summon the courage to ask the loan of fifteen dollars.\r\n\r\nInvited to dine with the Antiquarian Society, he met Lord Elgin, who\r\npresided, and was obliged to respond to a flattering toast, which made\r\nhim \"feel very faint and chill. I was expected to make a speech,\" he\r\nsays, \"but could not, and never had tried. Being called on for a reply,\r\nI said, 'Gentlemen, my incapacity for words to respond to your\r\nflattering notice is hardly exceeded by that of the birds now hanging on\r\nthe walls of your institution. I am truly obliged to you for your\r\nfavors, and can only say, God bless you all, and may your society\r\nprosper.' I sat down with the perspiration running over me.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Wilson prepared an article upon Audubon and his work for\r\n\"Blackwood's Magazine.\" His picture was hung in the Exhibition room. He\r\nwas made a member of the Wernerian Natural History Society, and of the\r\nRoyal Society. He was pleased, and said, \"So, poor Audubon, if not rich,\r\nthou wilt be honored at least, and held in high esteem among men.\"\r\n\r\nNo wonder he wrote to his wife: \"My success in Edinburgh borders on the\r\nmiraculous. My book is to be published in numbers, containing four birds\r\nin each, the size of life, in a style surpassing anything now existing,\r\nat two guineas a number. The engravings are truly beautiful; some of\r\nthem have been colored, and are now on exhibition.... I expect to visit\r\nthe Duke of Northumberland, who has promised to subscribe for my\r\nwork.... One hundred subscribers for my book will pay all expenses. Some\r\npersons are terrified at the sum of one hundred and eighty guineas for a\r\nwork,\"--nearly a thousand dollars,--\"but this amount is to be spread\r\nover eight years, during which time the volumes will be gradually\r\ncompleted. I am feted, feasted; elected honorary member of societies,\r\nmaking money by my exhibition and by my paintings. It is Mr. Audubon\r\nhere, and Mr. Audubon there, and I can only hope that Mr. Audubon will\r\nnot be made a conceited fool at last.\" There was no fear of this. He\r\nalways remained the modest, earnest, devoted student of nature.\r\n\r\nHe read before the Natural History Society a paper on the habits of the\r\nwild pigeon. He says, \"I began that paper on Wednesday, wrote all day,\r\nand sat up until half-past three the next morning; and so absorbed was\r\nmy whole soul and spirit in the work, that I felt as if I were in the\r\nwoods of America among the pigeons, and my ears were filled with the\r\nsound of their rustling wings. After sleeping a few hours, I rose and\r\ncorrected it.... Captain Hall expressed some doubts as to my views\r\nrespecting the affection and love of pigeons, as if I made it human, and\r\nraised the possessors quite above the brutes. I presume the love of the\r\nmothers for their young is much the same as the love of woman for her\r\noffspring. There is but one kind of love; God is love, and all his\r\ncreatures derive theirs from his: only it is modified by the different\r\ndegrees of intelligence in different beings and creatures.\"\r\n\r\nWith all this attention, his heart was never callous to suffering. \"I\r\nwas sauntering along the streets,\" he says, \"thinking of the beautiful\r\naspects of nature, meditating on the power of the great Creator, on the\r\nbeauty and majesty of his works, and on the skill he had given man to\r\nstudy them, when the whole train of my thoughts was suddenly arrested by\r\na ragged, sickly-looking beggar boy. His face told of hunger and\r\nhardship, and I gave him a shilling and passed on. But turning again,\r\nthe child was looking after me, and I beckoned to him to return. Taking\r\nhim back to my lodgings, I gave him all the garments I had which were\r\nworn, added five shillings more in money, gave him my blessing, and sent\r\nhim away rejoicing, and feeling myself as if God had smiled on me.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no sympathy so sweet as that born of experience. Noble-hearted\r\nAudubon! God had indeed \"smiled on him.\" Hereafter he was to walk in the\r\nsunlight of that smile. He was to work, of course, for there is no\r\napprobation for idleness, but he was to know want no more.\r\n\r\nMarch 17, 1827, he issued the prospectus of his book, which was to cost\r\nhim over one hundred thousand dollars. Here was courage, but he had been\r\nfighting obstacles all his life, and he believed he could succeed. In\r\nthis he said, \"The author has not contented himself, as others have\r\ndone, with single profile views, but in very many instances has grouped\r\nhis figures so as to represent the originals at their natural\r\navocations, and has placed them on branches of trees, decorated with\r\nfoliage, blossoms, and fruits, or amidst plants of numerous species.\r\nSome are seen pursuing their prey through the air, searching for food\r\namongst the leaves and herbage, sitting in their nests, or feeding their\r\nyoung; whilst others, of a different nature, swim, wade, or glide in or\r\nover their allotted element.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving Edinburgh, Audubon visited Newcastle, Leeds, York, Shrewsbury,\r\nand Manchester, securing a few subscribers to his work, at one thousand\r\ndollars each. It seemed difficult enough to spend a lifetime in\r\npreparing the book, without being obliged to perform the irksome and\r\ntrying task of selling it; but fame asks Herculean labors of its\r\nvotaries.\r\n\r\nOften he was pained by ill-mannered refusals. How few are like\r\nLongfellow, who could say \"no\" so kindly, that it almost seemed like\r\n\"yes.\" Audubon tells, in his journal, of an interview with the great\r\nbanker Rothschild. On opening the letter brought by the naturalist, the\r\nbaron said, \"This is only a letter of introduction, and I expect from\r\nits contents that you are the publisher of some book or other, and need\r\nmy subscription.\"\r\n\r\nNo man can be truly great who knows how to be uncivil!\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" he added, \"I never sign my name to any subscription list, but you\r\nmay send in your work and I will pay for a copy of it. I am busy, I wish\r\nyou good-morning.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the book was sent, the baron exclaimed, \"What, two hundred pounds\r\nfor birds! Why, sir, I will give you five pounds, and not a farthing\r\nmore!\" This offer was \"declined with thanks,\" and the book taken back to\r\nthe publishers.\r\n\r\nVery different from Rothschild was Sir Thomas Lawrence, the painter.\r\nOverwhelmed with work, he insisted on Audubon's remaining to his simple\r\nbreakfast of boiled eggs and coffee, called at his rooms later, examined\r\nhis drawings, and said he would bring a few purchasers, that very day.\r\n\"In about two hours,\" says Audubon, \"he returned with two gentlemen, to\r\nwhom he did not introduce me, but who were pleased with my work, and one\r\npurchased the 'Otter Caught in a Trap,' for which he gave me twenty\r\npounds sterling, and the other, 'A Group of Common Rabbits,' for fifteen\r\nsovereigns. I took the pictures to the carriage which stood at the\r\ndoor, and they departed, leaving me more amazed than I had been by their\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\n\"The second visit was much of the same nature, differing, however,\r\nchiefly in the number of persons he brought with him, which was three\r\ninstead of two; each one of whom purchased a picture, at seven, ten, and\r\nthirty-five pounds respectively; and, as before, the party and the\r\npictures left together in a splendid carriage with liveried footmen. I\r\nlonged to know their names, but, as Sir Thomas was silent respecting\r\nthem, I imitated his reticence in restraining my curiosity, and remained\r\nin mute astonishment....\r\n\r\n\"Without the sale of these pictures, I was a bankrupt, when my work was\r\nscarcely begun, and in two days more I should have seen all my hopes of\r\nthe publication blasted; for Mr. Havell, the engraver, had already\r\ncalled to say that on Saturday I must pay him sixty pounds. I was then\r\nnot only not worth a penny, but had actually borrowed five pounds a few\r\ndays before, to purchase materials for my pictures. But these pictures\r\nwhich Sir Thomas sold for me enabled me to pay my borrowed money, and to\r\nappear full-handed when Mr. Havell called. Thus I passed the Rubicon!\"\r\n\r\nBlessings on thee, Sir Thomas Lawrence, carrying out Emerson's divine\r\nmotto, \"Help somebody!\"\r\n\r\nBut Audubon did something more than try to obtain subscribers for his\r\nbook. He says: \"At that time I painted all day, and sold my work during\r\nthe dusky hours of evening, as I walked through the Strand and other\r\nstreets where the Jews reigned; popping in and out of Jew shops or any\r\nothers, and never refusing the offers made me for the pictures I carried\r\nfresh from the easel. Startling and surprising as this may seem, it is\r\nnevertheless true, and one of the curious events of my most\r\nextraordinary life. Let me add here, that I sold seven copies of the\r\n'Entrapped Otter,' in London, Manchester, and Liverpool, besides one\r\ncopy presented to my friend Mr. Richard Rathbone. In other pictures,\r\nalso, I have sold from seven to ten copies, merely by changing the\r\ncourse of my rambles; and strange to say, that when, in after years and\r\nbetter times, I called on the different owners to whom I had sold the\r\ncopies, I never found a single one in their hands.\"\r\n\r\nPainting all day, and selling his pictures at night along the streets of\r\nLondon, all to bring out the \"Birds of America!\" What a life history is\r\nbetween the leaves of that great work!\r\n\r\nSometimes, in his wanderings, he met poverty that made him \"sick of\r\nLondon;\" an artist making caricatures, while his wife and six little\r\nchildren begged; but he always gave part of what he had, and went back\r\nto his work, more than ever determined to win.\r\n\r\nSeptember 1, 1828, Audubon went to Paris, going first to Baron Cuvier.\r\nHe was busy--who is not that accomplishes anything?--and, while he\r\ncordially invited Audubon to dine, went on studying a small lizard.\r\n\"Great men show politeness in a particular way,\" says Audubon; \"they\r\nreceive you without much demonstration; a smile suffices to assure you\r\nthat you are welcome, and keep about their avocations as if you were a\r\nmember of the family.\"\r\n\r\nCuvier made a report of Audubon's work to the Academy of Sciences. He\r\nsaid, \"It may be described in a few words as the most magnificent\r\nmonument which has yet been erected to ornithology.... Formerly the\r\nEuropean naturalists were obliged to make known to America the riches\r\nshe possessed.... If that of Mr. Audubon should be completed, we shall\r\nbe obliged to acknowledge that America, in magnificence of execution,\r\nhas surpassed the world.\"\r\n\r\nAudubon also made the acquaintance of Baron Humboldt, Geoffrey\r\nSaint-Hilaire, and of Gerard, the painter, who said, \"You are the king\r\nof ornithological painters. We are all children in France or Europe. Who\r\nwould have expected such things from the woods of America!\"\r\n\r\nAfter two months in Paris, he returned to London, and soon sailed for\r\nAmerica. Once on his native soil, he says, \"My heart swelled with joy,\r\nand all seemed like a pleasant dream at first; but as soon as the\r\nreality was fairly impressed on my mind, tears of joy rolled down my\r\ncheeks. I clasped my hands, and fell on my knees, and, raising my eyes\r\nto heaven, I offered my thanks to our God, that he had preserved and\r\nprospered me in my long absence, and once more permitted me to approach\r\nthese shores so dear to me, and which hold my heart's best earthly\r\ntreasures.\"\r\n\r\nHe soon reached the Bayou Sara, and \"came suddenly on my dear wife: we\r\nwere both overcome with emotion, which found relief in tears.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained with his wife three months, collecting birds and making\r\ndrawings, and then both sailed together for England.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence he had been made a fellow of the Royal Society of\r\nLondon, much to his delight. Now that his \"Birds of America\" was coming\r\nout, he began earnestly upon a new work, \"Ornithological Biography of\r\nthe Birds of America,\" containing nearly three thousand pages, and\r\npublished for him by Mr. Black of Edinburgh. Two publishers refused this\r\nfamous work, and Audubon published at his own expense. The first volume\r\nwas finished in three months, and Mrs. Audubon copied it entire to send\r\nto America to secure copyright.\r\n\r\nAudubon worked untiringly. He wrote all day long, and \"so full was my\r\nmind of birds and their habits, that in my sleep I continually dreamed\r\nof birds.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Birds of America\" received good reviews in \"Blackwood's Magazine,\"\r\nand elsewhere. Audubon said, \"I have balanced my accounts with the\r\n'Birds of America,' and the whole business is really wonderful; forty\r\nthousand dollars have passed through my hands for the completion of the\r\nfirst volume. Who would believe that a lonely individual, who landed in\r\nEngland without a friend in the whole country, and with only sufficient\r\npecuniary means to travel through it as a visitor, could have\r\naccomplished such a task as this publication! Who would believe that\r\nonce, in London, Audubon had only one sovereign left in his pocket, and\r\ndid not know of a single individual to whom he could apply to borrow\r\nanother, when he was on the verge of failure in the very beginning of\r\nhis undertaking! And, above all, who would believe that he extricated\r\nhimself from all his difficulties, not by borrowing money, but by rising\r\nat four o'clock in the morning, working hard all day, and disposing of\r\nhis works at a price which a common laborer would have thought little\r\nmore than sufficient remuneration for his work!\"\r\n\r\nIn the four years required to bring out the work, fifty-six of his\r\nsubscribers, representing the sum of fifty-six thousand dollars,\r\nabandoned him, and he was obliged to leave London, and go into the\r\nprovinces to supply their places.\r\n\r\nSeptember 3, 1831, Audubon returned to America, spent the winter in\r\nEastern Florida, searching for birds and animals, and then some months\r\nin Labrador, having sent Victor to England to superintend the engraving\r\nof the drawings. In Labrador he collected one hundred and seventy-three\r\nskins of birds, and studied carefully the habits of the eider-duck,\r\nloons, wild geese, and other birds. Sometimes he was so weary from\r\ndrawing that \"my neck and shoulders, and most of all my fingers, have\r\nached from the fatigue. The fact is, I am growing old too fast, alas! I\r\nfeel it, and yet work I will, and may God grant me life to see the last\r\nplate of my mammoth work finished.\r\n\r\n\"Labrador is so grandly wild and desolate,\" he said, \"that I am charmed\r\nby its wonderful dreariness.... And yet how beautiful it is now, when\r\nyour eye sees the wild bee, moving from one flower to another in search\r\nof food, which doubtless is as sweet to her as the essence of the orange\r\nand magnolia is to her more favored sister in Louisiana. The little\r\nring-plover rearing its delicate and tender young; the eider-duck\r\nswimming man-of-war-like amid her floating brood, like the guardship of\r\na most valuable convoy; the white-crowned bunting's sonorous note\r\nreaching your ears ever and anon; the crowds of sea-birds in search of\r\nplaces wherein to repose or to feed.\"\r\n\r\nOn his return from Labrador, he went to Philadelphia, where he was\r\narrested for one of his old partnership debts, and would have been taken\r\nto prison except for a friend who kindly offered bail. From here he went\r\nto the house of an old friend, Rev. John Bachman of Charleston, S. C.,\r\nwhose two daughters subsequently married the two sons of Audubon, Victor\r\nand John. He returned to London, and in 1834 and 1835 published the\r\nsecond and third volumes of the \"Ornithological Biography.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1836 he came back to America for further research, and received a\r\nwarm welcome from distinguished men. Daniel Webster and Washington\r\nIrving became his earnest friends. The latter said that his work \"was\r\nhighly creditable to the nation,\" and deserved \"national patronage.\" He\r\ndined with Andrew Jackson at the White House. On his return to England\r\nhe wrote the fourth volume of the \"Ornithological Biography,\" and the\r\nfifth the following year.\r\n\r\nThis year, 1839, he returned to America to spend the rest of his life,\r\npurchased a home on the banks of the Hudson in upper New York, which he\r\ncalled \"Minnie's Land,\" the Scotch word for mother, this being the name\r\nby which he generally addressed his wife, to whom he left the whole of\r\nit at his death.\r\n\r\nHe was now sixty, but his work was not done. He immediately began to\r\nbring out his \"Birds of America\" in seven octavo volumes, with the\r\nfigures reduced and lithographed. He exhibited in New York his wonderful\r\ncollection of drawings, several thousands of birds and animals, all the\r\nsize of life, by his own hands.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, taking his son Victor, he started on an expedition to the\r\nYellowstone River, to collect animals and drawings for another great\r\nwork, the \"Quadrupeds of North America.\" After nearly a year he\r\nreturned, and began his book. In two years the first volume was ready;\r\nbut after this he could do no more. The rest of the great work was\r\nfinished by his sons after his death.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 the quick, active mind failed. His wife read to him, led him\r\nlike a child, and at the last fed him. One, at least, had never failed\r\nhim, since the day when she gave the money she earned to send him to\r\nEurope to win renown.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday morning, January 27, 1851, the eyes dulled for so long once\r\nmore showed their former lustre and beauty. Audubon did not speak, but\r\nhe seemed to know that the time had come for the last journey. He\r\nreached out his arms, clasped the hands of his wife and children, and\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nFour days later, surrounded by distinguished friends, he was buried in\r\nTrinity Church cemetery, where his sons now rest beside him. A\r\nsingularly guileless, sweet-natured man, who willed to do all this great\r\nwork when a boy, and achieved it when a man, because he had willed it.\r\n\r\nWell says General James Grant Wilson, in the life of Audubon so\r\nadmirably prepared by his wife, \"Long after the bronze statue of the\r\nnaturalist, that we hope soon to see erected in the Central Park, shall\r\nhave been wasted and worn beyond recognition by the winds and rains of\r\nHeaven, while the towering and snow-covered peak of the Rocky Mountains\r\nknown as Mount Audubon shall rear its lofty head among the clouds, while\r\nthe little wren chirps about our homes and the robin and reed-bird sing\r\nin the green meadows, while the melody of the mocking-bird is heard in\r\nthe cypress swamps of Louisiana, or the shrill scream of the eagle on\r\nthe frozen shores of the Northern seas, the name of John James Audubon,\r\nthe gifted artist, the ardent lover of nature, and the admirable writer,\r\nwill live in the hearts of his grateful countrymen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL FINLEY BREESE MORSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel F. B. Morse was born at the foot of Breed's Hill, Charlestown,\r\nMass., April 27, 1791. He was the eighth child in a family of eleven\r\nchildren, all of whom, except three sons, Samuel, Richard, and Sidney,\r\ndied in their infancy.\r\n\r\nThe father, Jedediah Morse, was a doctor of divinity, having\r\nstudied under Jonathan Edwards, and was also a journalist and\r\nwriter of books. He helped to establish the \"Boston Recorder,\" now\r\nthe \"Congregationalist,\" and with others laid the foundations of the\r\nTheological Seminary at Andover, the American Board of Foreign Missions,\r\nthe American Bible Society, and the American Tract Society. He was an\r\nimpulsive, hopeful man of wonderful energy, and, as Daniel Webster said,\r\nhe was \"always thinking, always writing, always talking, always acting.\"\r\n\r\nHis wife, Elizabeth Ann Breese, was the granddaughter of Samuel Finley,\r\nPresident of Princeton College, a woman of strong will, excellent\r\njudgment, and extremely pleasant manners. From the one, the boy Finley\r\ninherited energy and hope; from the other, agreeable manners and\r\nindomitable perseverance.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SAMUEL F. B. MORSE.\r\n  [From the Portrait Gallery of Eminent Men and Women.]]\r\n\r\nAt four years of age Finley was sent to a school near the parsonage,\r\nkept by \"Old Ma'am Rand.\" Being an invalid, she governed with a long\r\nrattan which reached from her chair across the schoolroom. Finley, early\r\ndeveloping artistic tastes, sketched the teacher's face with a pin on a\r\nchest of drawers. Probably the picture was not handsome, for the\r\noffender was punished by being pinned to her dress. Breaking away, and\r\ncarrying part of the dress with him, the rattan did its appropriate\r\nwork!\r\n\r\nAt seven he was sent to a school at Andover, and fitted for Phillips\r\nAcademy. He received helpful letters from his father. At ten, Dr. Morse\r\nwrites him: \"Your natural disposition, my dear son, renders it proper\r\nfor me earnestly to recommend to you to _attend to one thing at a time_;\r\nit is impossible that you can do two things well at the same time, and I\r\nwould therefore never have you attempt it. Never undertake to do what\r\nought not to be done, and then, whatever you undertake, endeavor to do\r\nit in the best manner. It is said of DeWitt, a celebrated statesman in\r\nHolland, who was torn to pieces in the year 1672, that he did the whole\r\nbusiness of the republic, and yet had time left to go to assemblies in\r\nthe evening, and sup in company.\r\n\r\n\"Being asked how he could possibly find time to go through so much\r\nbusiness, and yet amuse himself in the evenings as he did, he answered:\r\n'There was nothing so easy, for that it was only doing one thing at a\r\ntime, and never putting off anything till to-morrow that could be done\r\nto-day.' This steady and undissipated attention to one object is a sure\r\nmark of a superior genius, as hurry, bustle, and agitation are the\r\nnever-failing symptoms of a weak and frivolous mind.\"\r\n\r\nAt this early age Finley pored over Plutarch's \"Lives of Illustrious\r\nMen,\" and resolved, as many another boy from reading these volumes, to\r\nbe somebody. There is scarcely a more important thing for a child than\r\nthat parents should put into his or her hands stimulating and helpful\r\nbooks. When Finley was thirteen, he wrote a sketch of the \"Life of\r\nDemosthenes,\" and sent it to his father.\r\n\r\nAt fourteen he was admitted to the Freshman class at Yale, but did not\r\nattend college till the following year. He was a good scholar in\r\ngeometry and history, but was especially fond of natural philosophy and\r\nchemistry. Under Professor Jeremiah Day he began to study electricity,\r\nand witnessed the following experiments with great interest: \"Let the\r\nfluid pass through a chain, or through any metallic bodies placed at\r\nsmall distances from each other, the fluid in a dark room will be\r\nvisible between the links of the chain, or between the metallic\r\nbodies.... If the circuit be interrupted by several folds of paper, a\r\nperforation will be made through it, and each of the leaves will be\r\nprotruded by the stroke from the middle to the outward leaves.\"\r\n\r\nWriting upon this subject sixty years afterward, Morse said, \"The fact\r\nthat the presence of electricity can be made visible in any desired part\r\nof the circuit was the crude seed which took root in my mind, and grew\r\nup into form, and ripened into the invention of the telegraph.\"\r\n\r\nUnder Professor Benjamin Silliman, a name greatly honored in science,\r\nMorse found great delight and profit. He wrote to his parents, that he\r\nshould bring home \"a chemical trough, gun-barrels, retorts, etc.\"\r\n\r\nWith this fondness for science, Morse showed a decided ability in art.\r\nHe took pictures of his classmates, at one dollar each, and miniatures\r\non ivory at five dollars each, thus helping to pay his expenses. The\r\nprice charged was very low, but possibly it was all the pictures were\r\nworth, for as yet he had never taken a lesson.\r\n\r\nLong before his college course was at an end, he had decided to become a\r\npainter, probably much against the unspoken wishes of his parents, who\r\nmust have felt that poverty would be his companion, for some years, at\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nOn going home to Charlestown, he attended a course of anatomical and\r\nsurgical lectures in Boston. Washington Allston, then at the head of his\r\nprofession in America, had spent two years in Boston, and was about to\r\nreturn to Europe. Morse went with him and took lodgings in London. At\r\nonce he wrote home, \"I only wish you had this letter now to relieve your\r\nminds from anxiety, for while I am writing I can imagine mother wishing\r\nthat she could hear of my arrival, and thinking of thousands of\r\naccidents which may have befallen me. I _wish that in an instant I could\r\ncommunicate the information; but three thousand miles are not passed\r\nover in an instant, and we must wait four long weeks before we can hear\r\nfrom each other_.\"\r\n\r\nOn the outside of this letter, yellow with age, he wrote toward the end\r\nof his life, \"LONGING FOR A TELEGRAPH EVEN IN THIS LETTER.\"\r\n\r\nIn London he soon met Benjamin West, born in Springfield, Penn., then at\r\nthe head of the Royal Academy in England. He had been poor and obscure;\r\nnow he was distinguished, and courted even by royalty. Morse, ever\r\nambitious, soon arranged to study under West, and became his devoted\r\nadmirer. He wrote home: \"Mr. West is in his seventy-fourth year, but to\r\nsee him you would suppose him only about five-and-forty.... He expressed\r\ngreat attachment to his native country, and he told me, as a proof of\r\nit, he presented them with this large picture ('Christ Healing the\r\nSick'). I walked through his gallery of paintings of his own production.\r\nThere were upwards of two hundred, consisting principally of the\r\noriginal sketches of his large pieces. He has painted in all upward of\r\nsix hundred pictures, which is more than any artist ever did, with the\r\nexception of Rubens. Mr. West is so industrious now that it is hard to\r\nget access to him, and then only between the hours of nine and ten in\r\nthe morning. He is working on eight or nine different pieces at\r\npresent, and seems to be more enthusiastic than he ever was before....\r\nNo man, perhaps, ever passed through so much abuse, and I am confident\r\nno one ever bore up against its insolence with more nobleness of spirit.\r\nWith a steady perseverance in the pursuit of the sublimest profession,\r\nhe has travelled on, heedless of his enemies, till he is sure of\r\nimmortality.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse my fervor in the praise of this extraordinary man.... I think\r\nthere can be no stronger proof that human nature is the same always,\r\nthan that men of genius in all ages have been compelled to undergo the\r\nsame disappointments, and to pass through the same storms of calumny and\r\nabuse, doomed in their lifetime to endure the ridicule or neglect of the\r\nworld, and to wait for justice till they were dead.\"\r\n\r\nHow well, unknowingly, Morse foretold his own career; disappointments,\r\nabuse, ridicule!\r\n\r\nStimulated by the industry and renown of West, he worked at his drawing\r\nfrom half-past seven in the forenoon until five in the afternoon, and\r\nthen again in the evening. He learned what all persons learn, sooner or\r\nlater, that there is no easy road to fame.\r\n\r\nWest encouraged the young artist, and this added fuel to the flame of\r\nambition. Desiring admission to the Royal Academy, he spent two weeks in\r\nmaking a drawing from a small cast of the Farnese Hercules. Showing it\r\nto Mr. West for his criticism, West said, \"Very well, sir, very well;\r\ngo on and finish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ finished,\" replied Morse.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said Mr. West; \"look here, and here, and here.\"\r\n\r\nMorse drew a week longer, and again presented it. \"Very well, indeed,\r\nsir,\" he said; \"go on and finish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not finished?\" asked Morse, half discouraged.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" said West; \"see you have not marked that muscle, nor the\r\narticulations of the finger-joints.\"\r\n\r\nA third time he presented the drawing, and received the same advice as\r\nbefore. \"I cannot finish it,\" said Morse, despairingly.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said West, \"I have tried you long enough. Now, sir, you have\r\nlearned more by this drawing than you would have accomplished in double\r\nthe time by a dozen half-finished beginnings. It is not numerous\r\ndrawings, but the _character of one_, which makes a thorough\r\ndraughtsman. _Finish_ one picture, sir, and you are a painter.\"\r\n\r\nMorse was now admitted to the Royal Academy, and had visions of becoming\r\ngreat. He writes home: \"I have just finished a model in clay of a figure\r\n('The Dying Hercules'), my first attempt at sculpture. Mr. Allston is\r\nextremely pleased with it; he says it is better than all the things I\r\nhave done since I have been in England, put together, and says I must\r\nsend a cast of it home to you, and that it will convince you that I\r\nshall make a painter.... Mr. West also was extremely delighted with it.\r\nHe said it was not merely an academical figure, but displayed _thought_.\r\nHe could not have paid me a higher compliment.... My passion for my art\r\nis so firmly rooted that I am confident no human power could destroy it.\r\nThe more I study, the greater I think is its claim to the appellation of\r\n_divine_, and I never shall be able sufficiently to show my gratitude to\r\nmy parents for enabling me to pursue that profession without which I am\r\nsure I should be miserable. And if it is my destiny to become GREAT, and\r\n_worthy of a biographical memoir_, my biographer will never be _able to\r\ncharge_ upon my parents that bigoted attachment to any individual\r\nprofession, the exercise of which spirit by parents toward their\r\nchildren has been the ruin of some of the greatest geniuses.\"\r\n\r\nThe model of the \"Dying Hercules\" was sent to the Society of Arts at the\r\nAdelphi, and Morse received the _gold medal_ given for the _best_ work\r\nin painting, sculpture, and architecture.\r\n\r\nMorse had taken letters of introduction to several prominent persons,\r\nlike Wilberforce and Zachary Macaulay, the father of the historian, but\r\nhe was too busy to use them. He gives another reason also--poverty. He\r\nsays, \"With regard to my expenses, I got through the first year with two\r\nhundred pounds, and hope the same sum will carry me through the second.\r\nIf you knew the manner in which we live, you would wonder how it was\r\npossible I could have made so great a change in my habits. I am obliged\r\nto screw and pinch myself in a thousand things in which I used to\r\nindulge myself at home.... I breakfast on simple bread and butter, and\r\ntwo cups of coffee; I dine on either beef, mutton, or pork (_veal_ being\r\nout of the question, as it is one shilling and six pence per pound),\r\nbaked, with potatoes, warm perhaps twice a week, all the rest of the\r\nweek cold; at tea, bread and butter, with two cups of tea. This is my\r\ndaily round.\r\n\r\n\"I have had no new clothes for nearly a year; my best are threadbare,\r\nand my shoes are out at the toes; my stockings all want to see my\r\n_mother_, and my hat is growing hoary with age.... 'But,' you will say,\r\n'what do you do with the money, if you live thus sparingly?' Why, I will\r\ntell you the whole. When I first came to London, I was told, if I meant\r\nto support the character of a gentleman, I must take especial care of my\r\npersonal appearance; so I thought it a matter of course that I must\r\nspare no expense in order to appear well. So, this being first in my\r\nmind, I (supposing very wisely that London folks had nothing else to do\r\nbut to see how I was dressed) laid out a considerable part of my money\r\non myself; meanwhile, picture-galleries and collections, with many other\r\nplaces which I ought constantly to have visited, and which cost some\r\nmoney, were neglected. And why? Because _I could not afford it_.\r\n\r\n\"Well, in process of time, I found no very particular advantage to be\r\ngained by supporting the character of a gentleman, for these reasons: in\r\nthe first place, _nobody saw me_; in the second place, if they _had seen\r\nme_, they would not _have known me_; and, thirdly, if they had _known_\r\nme, they would not have _cared_ a farthing about me. So I thought within\r\nmyself what I came to England for, and I found that it was not to please\r\nEnglish folks, but to study painting; and, as I found I must sacrifice\r\npainting to dress and visiting, or dress and visiting to painting, I\r\ndetermined on the latter, and ever since have lived accordingly, and now\r\nthe tables are turned. I visit galleries and collections, purchase\r\nprints, etc.; and when I am asked why I don't pay more attention to my\r\ndress, I reply that I _cannot_ afford it.\"\r\n\r\nMorse had now painted the \"Death of Hercules,\" a large picture, eight\r\nfeet by six feet and a half. The painting was received at the exhibition\r\nat Somerset House, though six hundred other works were refused. It was\r\nadjudged by the press to be one of the best _nine_ among a thousand\r\npictures; many of them by such men as Turner, Lawrence, and Wilkie.\r\nSurely, he had reason to be encouraged.\r\n\r\nWhat little leisure Morse could obtain he spent in reading the old\r\npoets,--Spenser, Chaucer, Dante, and Tasso. He now made the acquaintance\r\nof Rogers, Coleridge, and others. Once, as he was going into the country\r\nwith Coleridge, he took in the carriage Irving's \"History of New York.\"\r\nOn retiring, Coleridge took the book and began to read. Morse fell\r\nasleep, and in the morning was surprised to find the lights burning, and\r\nhis friend still reading. It was now ten o'clock, and Coleridge was so\r\nabsorbed that he did not know that the whole night had passed. Later,\r\nIrving and Coleridge became warm friends.\r\n\r\nIn need of money, Morse repaired to Bristol, where he spent several\r\nmonths, having had the promise of work; but not a single person called\r\nto look at his pictures, and not one came for a portrait. He had already\r\nbeen abroad four years, and now stern necessity called him home. He had\r\njust finished a large picture, \"The Judgment of Jupiter in the Case of\r\nApollo, Marpessa, and Ida,\" to compete for the highest prize offered by\r\nthe Royal Academy for historical composition; but as he could not be\r\npresent to receive the premium, he was not allowed to enter the picture.\r\nHe accordingly brought it home with him, arriving in Boston October 18,\r\n1815.\r\n\r\nDr. Morse had engaged a studio for his son in Boston, and the \"Judgment\r\nof Jupiter\" was opened for exhibition. People came, and saw, and\r\npraised, and went away without leaving any orders for pictures. A year\r\nwent by, and not one person offered to buy the \"Judgment of Jupiter,\"\r\nand not one person ordered a historical work. This was indeed\r\ndiscouraging to an enthusiastic artist. He began now to turn his mind\r\ntoward invention, for which he had a natural tendency; and during the\r\nevenings he thought out an improvement in the common pump, one that\r\ncould be adapted to the forcing-pump in the fire-engine. The pump and\r\nthe \"Judgment of Jupiter\" certainly had not very much in common.\r\n\r\nThe patent pump was put on exhibition on Gray's Wharf in Charlestown,\r\nbut it did not cause money to flow into the pockets of its inventor.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in his art work, Morse took letters of introduction from\r\nhis father to several ministers in the neighboring towns, and started\r\nout to paint portraits at fifteen dollars apiece. This was not very much\r\nbetter than the five-dollar miniatures on ivory while in college,\r\nespecially as he had been to the expense of four years in Europe.\r\n\r\nAt Concord, N. H., he had good success, writing home that he had\r\n\"painted five portraits, had two more engaged, and many more talked of.\"\r\nWhile in London he had written to his parents, \"I came very near being\r\nat my old game of falling in love; but I find that _love_ and _painting_\r\nare quarrelsome companions, and that the house of my heart was too small\r\nfor both of them, so I have turned _Mrs. Love_ out-of-doors. 'Time\r\nenough,' thought I (with true old-bachelor complacency), 'time enough\r\nfor you these ten years to come.'\"\r\n\r\nBut Morse did not wait ten years, for at twenty-four he fell in love\r\nwith Lucretia P. Walker of Concord, and was engaged to her. She was not\r\nonly beautiful, but of the same lovable and intellectual type as Grace\r\nWebster, who held the heart of Daniel Webster while he lived. She\r\ncombined sound judgment with much tenderness of feeling. Morse was a\r\ntall, graceful, handsome young man, with blue eyes and winsome manners.\r\n\r\nDr. Morse and his wife at once sent for their prospective daughter to\r\nvisit them. She came, and, as she pleased a mother who idolized Finley,\r\nit is safe to conclude that she was indeed lovely.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1818, having been assured that he would find work in\r\nCharleston, S. C., he sailed from New York, and met with a pleasant\r\nreception in the home of his uncle, Dr. Finley. He found the society\r\nagreeable, but month after month passed, and there was not a single\r\nrequest for a portrait. At last, as he was about to return to New\r\nEngland, he begged his uncle to sit for a painting, as a small return\r\nfor his kindness. He did so, and an admirable picture resulted.\r\n\r\nFriends came to see it. At once Charleston perceived that a real artist\r\nwas in the city. He soon had one hundred and fifty orders at sixty\r\ndollars each! Hope came again to his heart; after a few months he\r\nreturned to Boston, and October 1, 1818, he married Lucretia Walker.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the Common Council of Charleston, he now painted the\r\nportrait of James Monroe, then President of the United States, and a\r\nyear later went again to South Carolina, leaving his wife and an infant\r\ndaughter in Concord, with her parents. On his return, Dr. Morse having\r\nresigned his pastorate at Charlestown, and moved to New Haven, Ct.,\r\nFinley also moved thither. Here he found delight in renewing his studies\r\nof galvanism and electricity under Professor Silliman.\r\n\r\nTiring of portraits, and longing for preeminence in art, he conceived\r\nthe idea of a historical piece, the \"House of Representatives,\" with\r\neighty portraits of individual members. For this purpose he went to\r\nWashington, and began his work in earnest. He writes to his young wife:\r\n\"I am up at daylight, have my breakfast and prayers over, and commence\r\nthe labors of the day long before the workmen are called to work on the\r\nCapitol by the bell. This I continue unremittingly till one o'clock,\r\nwhen I dine in about fifteen minutes, and then pursue my labors until\r\ntea, which scarcely interrupts me, as I often have my cup of tea in one\r\nhand and pencil in the other. Between ten and eleven o'clock I retire to\r\nrest. This has been my course every day (Sundays, of course, excepted)\r\nsince I have been here, making about fourteen hours study out of the\r\ntwenty-four. This, you will say, is too hard, and that I shall injure my\r\nhealth. I can say that I never enjoyed better health, and my body, by\r\nthe simple fare I live on, is disciplined to this course.... I have had\r\na great deal of difficulty with the perspective of my picture. But I\r\nhave conquered, and have accomplished my purpose. After having drawn in\r\nthe greater part three times, I have as many times rubbed it all out\r\nagain. I have been, several times, from daylight until eleven o'clock\r\nat night, solving a simple problem.\r\n\r\n\"How I do long to see that dear little girl of mine, and to hear her\r\nsweet prattle! Instruct her early, my dear wife, in the most important\r\nof all concerns; teach her that there is a great Father above, her\r\nobligations to him and to her Saviour. Kiss her often for papa, and tell\r\nher he will come back one of these days.\"\r\n\r\nSo absorbed did he become in this picture, that once he arose in the\r\nnight, mistaking the light of the moon for the day, and went to his\r\nwork, and another time attempted to enter the hall on Sunday, forgetting\r\neven the days of the week. When the work was finished and exhibited,\r\neverybody was too much interested in his own affairs to care about\r\ncongressmen, and the picture failed to attract the public. It proved a\r\nloss pecuniarily, and was purchased by an Englishman and taken to\r\nEngland. Twenty-five years afterward, it was found in the third story of\r\na store in New York, nailed against a board partition, and covered with\r\ndust. It had been sent over from London by a house which had advanced a\r\nsum of money upon it while in England. The picture afterward became the\r\nproperty of the artist Daniel Huntington.\r\n\r\nMorse now went to Albany, hoping to obtain some patronage from public\r\nmen. After long waiting, he writes to his wife: \"I have not as yet\r\nreceived any application for a portrait. Many tell me I have come at the\r\nwrong time--the same tune that has been rung in my ears so long! I hope\r\nthe right time will come by and by. The winter, it is said, is the\r\nproper season; but, as it is better in the South in that season, and it\r\nwill be more profitable to be there, I shall give Albany a thorough\r\ntrial and do my best. If I should not find enough to employ me here, I\r\nthink I shall return to New York and settle there. This I had rather not\r\ndo at present, but it may be the best that I can do. Roaming becomes\r\nmore and more irksome. Imperious necessity alone drives me to this\r\ncourse. Don't think by this I am faint-hearted. I shall persevere in\r\nthis course, painful as is the separation from my family, until\r\nProvidence clearly points out my duty to return.\"\r\n\r\nMorse now turned his attention to the invention of a machine for carving\r\nmarble, from which he hoped for pecuniary success, but success did not\r\nresult from it. He now went to New York to try his fortune. But things\r\nwere no brighter.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Lucretia: \"My last two letters have held out to you some\r\nencouraging prospects of success here, but now they seem darkened again.\r\nI have had nothing to do this week thus far but to wait patiently. I\r\nhave advertised in both of the city papers that I should remain one week\r\nto receive applications, but as yet it has produced no effect.... I\r\nsleep in my room on the floor, and put my bed out of sight during the\r\nday, as at Washington.... I have been active in calling on my friends\r\nand inviting them to my room; they have promised to come, but as yet\r\nfew have called. As far as human foresight can perceive, my prospects\r\nseem gloomy indeed. The only gleam of hope--and I cannot underrate\r\nit--is from confidence in God. When I look upward, it calms my\r\napprehensions for the future, and I seem to hear a voice saying: 'If I\r\nclothe the lilies of the field, shall I not also clothe you?' Here is my\r\nstrong confidence, and I will wait patiently for the direction of\r\nProvidence.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he writes to his wife: \"My cash is almost gone, and I begin to\r\nfeel some anxiety and perplexity to know what to do. I have advertised,\r\nand visited, and hinted, and pleaded, and even asked one man to sit, but\r\nall to no purpose.... My expenses, with the most rigid economy too, are\r\nnecessarily great; my rent to-morrow will amount to thirty-three\r\ndollars, and I have nothing to pay it with. What can I do? I have been\r\nhere five weeks, and there is not the smallest prospect _now_ of any\r\ndifference as to business.\"\r\n\r\nHe now attempted to obtain a situation in the legation about to be sent\r\nto Mexico. The place was promised, and Morse went to Washington, only to\r\nfind that the expedition had been abandoned.\r\n\r\nThere was an occasional rift in the clouds, as when the corporation of\r\nthe city of New York commissioned Morse to paint for them a portrait of\r\nGeneral Lafayette, then in Washington, the price to be about one\r\nthousand dollars. As Sully, Peale, Inman, and other prominent artists\r\nwere competitors in the application for this picture, to receive the\r\ncommission was indeed an honor.\r\n\r\nMorse now wrote cheerfully to his wife: \"When I consider how wonderfully\r\nthings are working for the promotion of the great and _long desired_\r\nevent,--that of being constantly with my dear family,--all unpleasant\r\nfeelings are absorbed in this joyful anticipation, and I look forward to\r\nthe spring of the year with delightful prospects of seeing my dear\r\nfamily permanently settled with me in our own hired house here.\"\r\n\r\nFebruary 8, 1825, he wrote his wife that he had met Lafayette, \"the man\r\nwhose beloved name has rung from one end of this continent to the other,\r\nwhom all flock to see, whom all delight to honor.\"\r\n\r\nThat very day a letter was penned him, not this time by the wife, but by\r\nhis father. \"My affectionately beloved son: Mysterious are the ways of\r\nProvidence. My heart is in pain and deeply sorrowful, while I announce\r\nto you the sudden and unexpected death of your dear and deservedly loved\r\nwife. Her death proved to be an _affection of the heart, incurable_ had\r\nit been known.... I wrote you yesterday that she was _convalescent_. So\r\nshe then appeared and so the doctor pronounced. She was up about five\r\no'clock yesterday afternoon, to have her bed made, as usual; was\r\nunusually cheerful and social; spoke of the pleasure of being with her\r\ndear husband in New York ere long; stepped into bed herself, fell back,\r\nwith a momentary struggle, on her pillow; her eyes were immediately\r\nfixed, the paleness of death overspread her countenance, and in five\r\nminutes more, without the slightest motion, her mortal life terminated.\r\n\r\n\"It happened that, just at this moment, I was entering her chamber-door,\r\nwith Charles in my arms, to pay her my usual visit, and to pray with\r\nher. The nurse met me affrighted, calling for help. Your mother, the\r\nfamily, and neighbors, full of the tenderest sympathy and kindness, and\r\nthe doctor, thronged the house in a few minutes; everything was done\r\nthat could be done, to save her life. But her appointed time had come,\r\nand no earthly skill or power could stay the hand of death. It was the\r\nLord who gave her to you, the chiefest of all your earthly blessings,\r\nand it is he that has taken her away; and may you be enabled, my son,\r\nfrom the heart to say, 'Blessed be the name of the Lord!'\"\r\n\r\nThe heart of Morse was well nigh broken. The woman he had idolized had\r\ngone from him in a moment. He wrote back to his father: \"Oh, is it\r\npossible? is it possible? Shall I never see my dear wife again? But I\r\ncannot trust myself to write on the subject. I need your prayers, and\r\nthose of Christian friends, to God for support. I fear I shall sink\r\nunder it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, take good care of her dear children!\r\n\r\n                                             \"Your agonized son,\r\n                                                           \"FINLEY.\"\r\n\r\nTravelling by stage, he did not reach New Haven till his wife had been\r\nburied a week. A month later he wrote to a friend: \"I dare not yet give\r\nmyself up to the full survey of its desolating effects; every day brings\r\nto my mind a thousand new and fond connections with dear Lucretia, all\r\nnow ruptured. I feel a dreadful void, a heart-sickness, which time does\r\nnot seem to heal, but rather to aggravate. You know the intensity of the\r\nattachment which existed between dear L. and me, never for a moment\r\ninterrupted by the smallest cloud; an attachment founded, I trust, in\r\nthe purest love, and daily strengthening by all the motives which the\r\nties of _nature_ and more especially of _religion_ furnish.\r\n\r\n\"I found in dear L. everything that I could wish. Such ardor of\r\naffection, so uniform, so unaffected, I never saw nor read of, but in\r\nher. My fear with regard to the measure of my affection toward her, was\r\nnot that I might fail of 'loving her as my own flesh,' but that I should\r\nput her in the place of Him who has said, 'Thou shalt have no other gods\r\nbut me.' I felt this to be my greatest danger, and to be saved from this\r\n_idolatry_ was often the subject of my earnest prayers. If I had desired\r\nanything in my dear L. different from what she was, it would have been\r\nthat she had been _less lovely_. My whole soul seemed wrapped up in her;\r\nwith her was connected all that I expected of happiness on earth.\"\r\n\r\nShe was but twenty-five, and had shared only the sorrows and privations\r\nof her young husband. How pitiful it seemed that she could not live to\r\nshare his grand success. Whatever may come into a man's life afterwards,\r\nhe never forgets an affection like this. It blossoms in the warm\r\nsunlight of his youth; it never withers, even though other flowers take\r\nroot in the heart.\r\n\r\nTruly says George Eliot: \"There is no despair so absolute as that which\r\ncomes with the first moments of our first great sorrow, when we have not\r\nyet known what it is to have suffered and be healed, to have despaired\r\nand to have recovered hope.\"\r\n\r\nThis despair seemed to have settled upon Morse. He went back to New\r\nYork, and now had plenty of work, but he said, \"After being fatigued at\r\nnight, and having my thoughts turned to my irreparable loss, I am ready\r\nalmost to give up. The thought of seeing my dear Lucretia, and returning\r\nhome to her, served always to give me fresh courage and spirits whenever\r\nI felt worn down by the labors of the day, and now I hardly know what to\r\nsubstitute in her place.\"\r\n\r\nHard, indeed, it seemed, that this \"plenty of work\" did not come in\r\nLucretia's life-time. Why are so many of the best and sweetest things in\r\nthis world a little too late in their coming? Is it because perfection\r\nattained is not best for mortals?\r\n\r\nAbout this time the National Academy of Design was organized, and Morse\r\nwas made president, holding this position for eighteen years, till his\r\nwork on the telegraph required his whole attention. These years were\r\nextremely busy years. So numerous were his sitters, that he was obliged\r\nto send many to his artist friends. In his evenings he prepared a series\r\nof lectures on the Fine Arts, which he delivered to large and\r\nfashionable audiences at the New York Athenaeum. He also wrote at this\r\ntime a life of Lucretia Maria Davidson, a young poet who died at\r\nPlattsburg, N. Y., when she was seventeen, and several pamphlets against\r\nthe growing power of the Romish Church.\r\n\r\nFour years after the death of his wife he sailed for Italy, still\r\nfurther to study his beloved art. In London he again met Rogers, the\r\npoet,--\"he has not the proverbial lot of the poet,--he is not poor, for\r\nhe is one of the wealthiest bankers, and lives in splendid style,\" said\r\nMorse,--Turner, \"the best landscape-painter living,\" Irving, our\r\nsecretary of legation, and other distinguished men.\r\n\r\nFor three years Morse remained in Europe, in Rome becoming the friend of\r\nThorwaldsen, whose portrait he painted; in Florence, of Horatio\r\nGreenough, the sculptor, of James Fenimore Cooper, and many others. In\r\nParis, Morse painted the \"Gallery of the Louvre,\" working from nine till\r\nfour daily, meeting Baron Humboldt, and receiving the cordial\r\nhospitality of General Lafayette.\r\n\r\nOctober 1, 1832, he sailed from Havre, on the packet ship Sully, for New\r\nYork. That passage marked an epoch not only in the life of S. F. B.\r\nMorse, but an epoch in American progress. At the dinner-table the\r\nconversation turned upon recent discoveries in electro-magnetism, and\r\nthe experiments of Ampere with the electro-magnet. Morse said, \"If the\r\npresence of electricity can be made visible in any part of the circuit,\"\r\nand he had seen that it could years before in the class-room at Yale\r\nCollege, \"I see no reason why intelligence may not be transmitted\r\ninstantaneously by electricity.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought the subject over as he walked upon the deck, and as he lay in\r\nhis berth, too deeply interested to sleep. If intelligence could be\r\ntransmitted, it could be recorded. He took from his pocket a note-book,\r\nand thought out his alphabet of dots and lines. He showed his sketches\r\nto his fellow-passengers,--not a wise thing, as it proved, when, later,\r\none of the persons on board laid claim to the invention, causing some\r\nyears of litigation.\r\n\r\nWhen the vessel reached New York, Morse said, \"Well, captain, should you\r\nhear of the telegraph one of these days as the wonder of the world,\r\nremember the discovery was made on board the good ship Sully.\"\r\n\r\nElectricity had been known and studied since early times. It had been\r\nascertained that the electric force could be stored up, as in the Leyden\r\njar, and that it could be conducted through long metallic wires. The\r\ndiscovery of the Voltaic pile, or battery, in 1800, gave a great impetus\r\nto the study. Oersted of Copenhagen found that the position of the\r\nmagnetic needle may be changed by the electric current, and that a\r\nmagnet will induce electricity in a coil of wire. Schweigger of Halle\r\ndiscovered that \"the deflection of the needle may be increased by\r\ncoiling an insulated wire in a series of ovals or flat rings, compactly\r\ndisposed, in a loop, and conducting the current around the needle from\r\nend to end.\" Ampere developed the theory of electro-magnetism, and\r\nproposed to the French Academy in 1820 a plan for a telegraph, in which\r\nthere was to be a needle for each letter.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 Morse had listened to a course of lectures, given by Prof. James\r\nFreeman Dana, upon these matters, so that the subject was still fresh in\r\nhis mind when he crossed the ocean in the Sully. Prof. Joseph Henry's\r\nimportant discoveries were also well known.\r\n\r\nSays Prof. E. N. Horsford of Cambridge, Mass., in the admirable life of\r\nMorse written by Dr. Samuel Irenaeus Prime: \"He knew generally, when he\r\nstepped on board the Sully, in 1832, that a soft-iron horseshoe-shaped\r\nbar of iron could be rendered magnetic while a current of galvanic\r\nelectricity was passing through a wire wound round it; and he knew that\r\nelectricity had been transmitted, apparently instantaneously, through\r\nwires of great length, by Franklin and others.... In the leisure of\r\nship-life the idea of a _recording_ electric telegraph seized Professor\r\nMorse's mind, and he gave expression to his conviction that it was\r\n_possible_. As it was possible to _dispatch_ and to _arrest_ the\r\ncurrent, he conceived that some device could be found for compelling it\r\nto manifest itself by this intermittent action, and produce a record.\r\n\r\n\"He knew, for he had witnessed it years before, that by means of a\r\nbattery and an electro-magnet reciprocal motion could be produced. He\r\nknew that the force which produced it could be transmitted along a wire.\r\nHe _believed_ that the battery current could be made, through an\r\nelectro-magnet, to produce physical effects at a _distance_. He saw in\r\nhis mind's eye the existence of an agent and a medium by which\r\nreciprocal motion could be not only produced, but _controlled_, at a\r\n_distance_. The question that addressed itself to him at the outset was\r\nnaturally this: 'How can I make use of the simple up-and-down motion of\r\nopening and closing a circuit to write an intelligible message at one\r\nend of a wire, and at the same time print it at the other?'...\r\n\r\n\"Like many a kindred work of genius, it was in nothing more wonderful\r\nthan in its simplicity. First, he caused a continuous ribbon or strip of\r\npaper to move under a pencil by clock-work, that could be wound up. The\r\npaper moved horizontally. The pencil moved only up and down; when\r\nresting on the paper it made a mark--if for an instant only, a dot; if\r\nfor a longer time, a line. When lifted from the paper it left a\r\nblank.... The grandeur of this wonderful alphabet of dots, lines, and\r\nspaces has not been fully appreciated....\r\n\r\n\"Not one of all the brilliant scientific men who have attached their\r\nnames to the history of electro-magnetism had brought the means to\r\nproduce the practical registering telegraph. Some of them had ascended\r\nthe tower that looked out on the field of conquest. Some of them brought\r\nkeener vision than others. Some of them stood higher than others; but\r\nthe genius of invention had not recognized them. There was needed an\r\ninventor.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as Morse left the ship Sully, and met his brothers Richard and\r\nSidney, he told them that he had made an important invention, \"one that\r\nwould astonish the world, and of the success of which he was perfectly\r\nsanguine.\" He became an inmate of Richard's house, living there several\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nFrom this time onward for twelve years he labored to give his telegraph\r\nto mankind; labored in the midst of distressing poverty, the ridicule of\r\nacquaintances, and the indifference of the world. Three motherless\r\nchildren were dependent upon him, but he could do little for them.\r\n\r\nOn the corner of Nassau and Beekman Streets, in the newspaper building\r\nerected by his brothers,--they were the editors and proprietors of the\r\n\"New York Observer,\"--in the fifth story, a room was assigned to him\r\nwhich he used for studio, sleeping-room, kitchen, and workshop. On one\r\nside was his cot, on the other his tools and crude machine. He whittled\r\nthe models, and then made the moulds and castings. Here, from day to\r\nday, the simplest food was brought him, he preparing his own tea.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1835, having been appointed professor of the Literature of\r\nthe Arts of Design in the New York City University, he took rooms in the\r\nthird story of the university building. \"There,\" he says, \"I immediately\r\ncommenced, with very limited means, to experiment upon my invention. My\r\nfirst instrument was made up of an old picture or canvas frame fastened\r\nto a table; the wheels of an old wooden clock, moved by a weight to\r\ncarry the paper forward; three wooden drums, upon one of which the paper\r\nwas wound and passed over the other two; a wooden pendulum suspended to\r\nthe top piece of the picture or stretching-frame, and vibrating across\r\nthe paper as it passes over the centre wooden drum; a pencil at the\r\nlower end of the pendulum, in contact with the paper; an electro-magnet\r\nfastened to a shelf across the picture or stretching-frame, opposite to\r\nan armature made fast to the pendulum; a type rule, and type for\r\nbreaking the circuit, resting on an endless band, composed of\r\ncarpet-binding, which passed over two wooden rollers, moved by a wooden\r\ncrank, and carried forward by points projecting from the bottom of the\r\nrule downward into the carpet-binding; a lever, with a small weight on\r\nthe upper side; and a tooth, projecting downward at one end, operated on\r\nby the type; and a metallic fork, also projecting downward over two\r\nmercury-cups; and a short circuit of wire, embracing the helices of the\r\nelectro-magnet connected with the positive and negative poles of the\r\nbattery, and terminating in the mercury-cups.\"\r\n\r\nMorse was now so poor that he bought his food in small quantities from\r\nsome grocery, and prepared it himself. He says, \"To conceal from my\r\nfriends the stinted manner in which I lived, I was in the habit of\r\nbringing my food to my room in the evenings, and this was my mode of\r\nlife for many years.\"\r\n\r\nIn this year, 1835, says Professor Horsford, \"Morse made his discovery\r\nof the _relay_, the most brilliant of all the achievements to which his\r\nname must be forever attached. It was the discovery of a means by which\r\nthe current, which through distance from its source had become feeble,\r\ncould be reenforced or renewed. This discovery, according to the\r\ndifferent objects for which it is employed, is variously known as the\r\nregistering magnet, the local circuit, the marginal circuit, the\r\nrepeater, etc. It made transmission from one point on a main line\r\nthrough indefinitely great distances, and through an indefinite number\r\nof branch lines, and to an indefinite number of way-stations, and\r\nregistration at all, possible and practicable, from a single act of a\r\nsingle operator.\"\r\n\r\nPoor, longing for money to carry forward his plans, despondent lest some\r\none think out a kindred machine and supplant him, Morse was also\r\nsuffering from injustice in his art work. Our government having offered\r\nto American artists commissions to paint pictures for the panels in the\r\nRotunda of the Capitol, the friends of Morse urged that he, as the\r\npresident of the National Academy of Design, be one of the artists\r\nchosen by the committee. John Quincy Adams, ex-President of the United\r\nStates, and one of the committee, urged that foreign artists be allowed\r\nto compete, stating that no American artists were competent for the\r\nwork. This, of course, gave offence, and James Fenimore Cooper wrote a\r\nsevere article, in the \"New York Evening Post,\" upon Mr. Adams's\r\nremarks. The article was attributed to Morse, and his name was rejected\r\nby the committee. This was a great disappointment.\r\n\r\nHe said, years afterward, \"The blow I received from Congress ... has\r\nalmost destroyed my enthusiasm for my art.... I have not painted a\r\npicture since that decision.... When I applied to paint one of the\r\nRotunda pictures, I was in my full vigor. I had just returned from three\r\nyears' hard study in Italy, ... and felt a consciousness of ability to\r\nexecute a work creditable to my country. I hazarded everything almost\r\nfor this single object. When so unexpectedly I was repelled, I staggered\r\nunder the blow. I have endeavored in every way to prevent its effects\r\nupon my mind; but it is a thorn which perpetually obtrudes its point,\r\nand would goad me to death were it not for its aspect in the light of\r\nGod's overruling providence. Then all is right.\"\r\n\r\nFrom time to time prominent men came to the university, to see the\r\ntelegraph. They saw, thought it wonderful, doubted its practicability,\r\nand did not offer to invest any money in the enterprise. Finally, in\r\n1837, Mr. Alfred Vail, a young graduate of the University of the City of\r\nNew York, became interested, helped to construct an improved machine at\r\nhis father's brass-works at Speedwell, N. J., for Morse to take to\r\nWashington for exhibition, and provided the means for his going.\r\n\r\nAfter five long years, Morse had finally found some one ready to help.\r\nArriving at Washington, he obtained the use of the room of the Committee\r\non Commerce, to show his telegraph. Congressmen came, wondered, and went\r\naway doubting.\r\n\r\nHe now caused a respectful memorial to be presented to Congress, asking\r\nan appropriation of thirty thousand dollars, to test the telegraph\r\nbetween two cities. The petition was referred to a committee, quietly\r\nignored, and Morse heard no more concerning it.\r\n\r\nHe sailed for Europe in 1838, to take out a patent for his work, but\r\ncould obtain none in England, as Wheatstone and Cooke had already\r\npatented a magnetic-needle telegraph, entirely unlike that of Morse,\r\ninvented four years later, says Professor Horsford, but brought before\r\nthe public about the same time, 1837. In point of active use,\r\nWheatstone's preceded Morse's telegraph by six years, on account of the\r\nindifference of Congress in helping the inventor.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, Morse submitted his telegraph to the Institute, and Arago,\r\nHumboldt, and others were delighted with it. As Morse was sending a word\r\nfrom one room to the other, Robert Walsh said to him, \"The next word you\r\nmay write is 'IMMORTALITY,' for the sublimity of this invention is of\r\nsurpassing grandeur. I see now that all physical obstacles, which may\r\nfor a while hinder, will inevitably be overcome. The problem is solved;\r\nMAN MAY INSTANTLY CONVERSE WITH HIS FELLOW-MAN IN ANY PART OF THE\r\nWORLD.\"\r\n\r\nMorse returned to New York after eleven months, disappointed that\r\nCongress had done nothing, \"without,\" as he said, \"a farthing in my\r\npocket, and have to borrow even for my meals.\" In Paris, having learned\r\nfrom M. Daguerre, the inventor of the daguerreotype, the process, Morse\r\nintroduced it in this country, and earned enough by taking pictures to\r\nreimburse him for his European journey. Many crowded to his rooms to be\r\ntaught, and he cheerfully imparted the knowledge he possessed.\r\n\r\nAs the months went by and Congress did nothing, Morse became despondent.\r\nHe had not the means even to pay postage on letters. He said, \"I am sick\r\nat heart.... I feel at times almost ready to cast the whole matter to\r\nthe winds, and turn my attention forever from the subject.\" The Vails\r\nwere unable to help the enterprise further, at present. Morse was still\r\nteaching a few pupils at the university. Gen. Strother, of Virginia,\r\n\"Porte Crayon,\" thus tells of Morse's pecuniary condition: \"He was very\r\npoor. I remember that when my second quarter's pay was due, my\r\nremittance from home did not come as expected; and one day the professor\r\ncame in, and said, courteously:\r\n\r\n\"'Well, Strother, my boy, how are we off for money?'\r\n\r\n\"'Why, professor,' I answered, 'I am sorry to say I have been\r\ndisappointed; but I expect a remittance next week.'\r\n\r\n\"'Next week,' he repeated, sadly; 'I shall be dead by that time.'\r\n\r\n\"'Dead, sir?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, dead by starvation!'\r\n\r\n\"I was distressed and astonished. I said, hurriedly: 'Would ten dollars\r\nbe of any service?'\r\n\r\n\"'Ten dollars would save my life; that is all it would do.'\r\n\r\n\"I paid the money, all that I had, and we dined together. It was a\r\nmodest meal, but good, and, after he had finished, he said: 'This is my\r\nfirst meal in twenty-four hours. Strother, don't be an artist. It means\r\nbeggary. Your life depends upon people who know nothing of your art, and\r\ncare nothing for you. A house-dog lives better, and the very\r\nsensitiveness that stimulates an artist to work keeps him alive to\r\nsuffering.'\"\r\n\r\nEven the janitor of the University building said to a young man who was\r\nlooking for a studio for himself: \"You will have an artist for your\r\nneighbor, though he is not here much of late; he seems to be getting\r\nrather shiftless, he is wasting his time over some silly invention, a\r\nmachine by which he expects to send messages from one place to another.\r\nHe is a very good painter, and might do well if he would only stick to\r\nhis business; but, Lord!\" he added, with a sneer of contempt, \"the idea\r\nof telling by a little streak of lightning what a body is saying at the\r\nother end of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Judge of my astonishment,\" says the young man, \"when he informed me\r\nthat the 'shiftless individual,' whose foolish waste of time so much\r\nexcited his commiseration, was none other than the president of the\r\nNational Academy of Design,--the most exalted position, in my youthful\r\nartistic fancy, it was possible for mortal to attain.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more, in some way, Morse obtained the money to go to Washington,\r\nand make another effort. December 30, 1842, a bill was at last\r\nsubmitted, asking for the thirty-thousand-dollar appropriation. It\r\nreceived much ridicule from some of the members. One suggested that\r\nthere should be an appropriation for mesmeric experiments; another\r\nsuggested the same for Millerism. At last the vote was taken in the\r\nHouse, Morse sitting in the gallery watching the result with feverish\r\nanxiety. The vote stood 89 yeas to 83 nays. IT WAS CARRIED.\r\n\r\nWould it pass the Senate? The amount of business to be transacted made\r\nits coming up improbable. The last day of the session came. Morse sat\r\nall the day and evening in the gallery, and finally went to his hotel,\r\nnearly prostrated from disappointment.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, as he came down to breakfast, Annie G. Ellsworth, the\r\ndaughter of his old friend, the Commissioner of Patents, came toward him\r\nwith a bright smile, saying: \"I have come to congratulate you!\"\r\n\r\n\"For what, my dear friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the passage of your bill.\"\r\n\r\nMorse could scarcely believe the good news, that the bill had passed, in\r\nthe last moments of the session, without opposition. He was nearly\r\novercome with joy, and told the young lady that she should send the\r\nfirst message over the first line.\r\n\r\nHe at once proceeded to construct the first line of his electric\r\ntelegraph between Washington and Baltimore. Ezra Cornell, later one of\r\nthe most successful constructors and largest proprietors of telegraphs,\r\nand the founder of Cornell University, was employed at a salary of one\r\nthousand dollars a year.\r\n\r\nAfter many perplexities, the line was completed. On May 24, 1844, Morse\r\ninvited his friends to assemble in the chamber of the United States\r\nSupreme Court, where he had his instrument in connection with Baltimore.\r\nAnnie Ellsworth's mother had suggested to her these words from the\r\nBible, for the first message: \"What hath God wrought!\" No words could\r\nhave been more in accordance with Morse's feelings. Taking his seat at\r\nthe instrument, he spelled out the words, and instantly they were\r\nreceived by Mr. Vail in Baltimore, who resent them the same moment to\r\nWashington. The strip of paper on which this message is printed is now\r\nin the Athenaeum at Hartford, Conn.\r\n\r\nWhat must have been Professor Morse's feelings at that moment. The day\r\nof triumph had come--the twelve weary years of poverty were over.\r\nHereafter he was to be like one of the princes of the world.\r\n\r\nA telegraph company was formed which offered to sell the telegraph to\r\nthe government for one hundred thousand dollars. Congress refused to\r\nbuy, much to the subsequent profit of the Morse company. In less than\r\nthirty years, the Morse telegraph was used in America upon two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand miles of wire, and in foreign countries upon six\r\nhundred thousand miles of wire, while the telegraph receipts throughout\r\nthe world were about forty million dollars yearly.\r\n\r\nThere were many amusing incidents in connection with this early\r\ntelegraph. \"A pretty little girl tripped into the Washington City\r\ntermination, and, after a great deal of hesitation and blushing, asked\r\nhow long it would take to send to Baltimore. The interesting appearance\r\nof the little questioner attracted Mr. Morse's attention, and he very\r\nblandly replied, '_One second!_'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, how delightful, how delightful!' ejaculated the little beauty, her\r\neyes glistening with delight. 'One second only; here, send this even\r\n_quicker_ if you can.' And Mr. Morse found in his hand a neatly folded,\r\ngilt-edged note, the very perfume and shape of which told a volume of\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n\"'I cannot send this note,' said Mr. Morse, with some feeling; 'it is\r\nimpossible.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, do, _do!_' implored the distracted girl. 'William and I have had a\r\nquarrel, and I shall die if he don't know that I forgive him in a\r\nsecond. I know I shall.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Morse still objected to sending the note, when the fair one,\r\nbrightening up, asked, 'You will, then, send _me_ on, won't you?'\r\n\r\n\"'Perhaps,' said one of the clerks, 'it would take your breath away to\r\ntravel forty miles in a second.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, no, it won't! no, it won't, if it carries me to William! The cars\r\nin the morning go _so slow_ I can't wait for them.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Morse now comprehended the mistake which the petitioner was\r\nlaboring under, and attempted to explain the process of conveying\r\nimportant information along the wires. The letter-writer listened a few\r\nmoments, impatiently, and then rolled her burning epistle into a ball,\r\nin the excitement under which she labored, and thrust it into her bosom.\r\n\r\n\"'It's too slow!' she finally exclaimed; 'it's too slow! and my heart\r\nwill break before William knows I forgive him; and you are a cruel man,\r\nMr. Morse,' said the fair creature, the tears coming into her eyes,\r\n'that you won't let me travel by the telegraph to see William.' And,\r\nfull of emotion, she left the office.\"\r\n\r\nAll these years Morse was longing for a home. In 1845 he wrote his\r\ndaughter, who was now married and living in Porto Rico, in the West\r\nIndies, \"I do long for the time, if it shall be permitted, to have you,\r\nwith your husband and little Charles, around me; I feel my loneliness\r\nmore and more keenly every day. Fame and money are, in themselves, a\r\npoor substitute for domestic happiness: as means to that end, I value\r\nthem. Yesterday was the sad anniversary (the twentieth) of your dear\r\nmother's death, and I spent the most of it in thinking of her.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years later he purchased two hundred acres on the Hudson River, near\r\nPoughkeepsie, calling it \"Locust Grove,\" and built a handsome and\r\nspacious Italian villa for his residence. With the telegraph in his\r\nlibrary, he could now converse with men in all parts of the world. Here\r\nhe gathered his children and grandchildren around him. He was now\r\nfifty-six years old. Fame and money had come late in life. The next year\r\nhe married Miss Sarah E. Griswold, the daughter of his cousin, a lady\r\nthirty years his junior.\r\n\r\nHis life here was peaceful and happy, most of the day being spent in\r\nreading and writing. He was very fond of nature. One of his daughters\r\nwrites: \"He loved flowers. He would take one in his hand, and talk for\r\nhours about its beauty, its wonderful construction, and the wisdom and\r\nlove of God in making so many varied forms of life and color to please\r\nour eyes. In his later years he became deeply interested in the\r\nmicroscope, and purchased one of great excellence and power. For whole\r\nhours, all the afternoon or evening, he would sit over it, examining\r\nflowers, or the animalcula in different fluids. Then he would gather his\r\nchildren about him, and give us a sort of _extempore_ lecture on the\r\nwonders of creation, invisible to the naked eye, but so clearly brought\r\nto view by the magnifying power of the microscope.\r\n\r\n\"He was very fond of animals, cats and birds in particular. He tamed a\r\nlittle flying-squirrel, and it became so fond of him that it would sit\r\non his shoulder while he was at his studies, and would eat out of his\r\nhand, and sleep in his pocket. To this little animal he became so much\r\nattached that we took it with us to Europe, where it came to an untimely\r\nend, in Paris, by running into an open fire.\"\r\n\r\nIn New York he bought a large house, No. 5 West Twenty-second Street,\r\nfor his winter residence, and, on a vacant lot adjoining, erected an\r\nelegant building for his library and study. What a contrast between this\r\nand the time when \"Porte Crayon\" gave him ten dollars, which Morse said\r\nwould save his life!\r\n\r\nHonors now poured in upon him. In 1835 he had been elected a member of\r\nthe Historical Institute of France.\r\n\r\nIn 1837, a member of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Belgium.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 the Great Silver Medal of the Academy of Industry of Paris was\r\nvoted him.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, a corresponding member of the National Institution for the\r\nPromotion of Science at Washington.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, the gold medal of the American Institute.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, a corresponding member of the Archaeological Society of Belgium.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, Doctor of Laws by Yale College.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, the first decoration ever bestowed by the Sultan of Turkey upon\r\na citizen of the United States, _Nishan Iftikar_, in diamonds; he was\r\nalso made a member of the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Boston.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, a golden snuff-box containing the Prussian golden medal for\r\nscientific merit.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, the Great Gold Medal of Arts and Sciences from the King of\r\nWuertemberg.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, the Great Gold Medal of Science and Art from the Emperor of\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, the brevet and decoration as Chevalier of the Imperial Order of\r\nthe Legion of Honor, from the Emperor of France.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, the Cross of the Order of Dannebrog from the King of Denmark.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Sweden.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, the order of knighthood and Commander of the First Class of the\r\nRoyal Order of Isabella the Catholic, from Isabella II. of Spain.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, Knight of the Tower and Sword, from the King of Portugal.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, Chevalier of the Royal Order of Saints Lazaro and Mauritio,\r\nfrom Victor Emmanuel II., King of Italy.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, honorary member of the Societe de Physique et d'Histoire\r\nNaturelle of Geneva, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, Morse aided in the attempt to lay the Atlantic cable, being\r\nmade electrician of the company. This was eminently fitting, as he had\r\nlaid the first submarine cable, in 1842, October 18; one moonlight night\r\nin the harbor of New York City, between Castle Garden and Governor's\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, France, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Piedmont, Russia,\r\nthe Holy See, Sweden, Tuscany, and Turkey presented Mr. Morse with an\r\nhonorary gratuity of four hundred thousand francs, \"as a reward,\r\naltogether personal, of your useful labors.\"\r\n\r\nDuring an extended trip in Europe, he was presented at the Court of\r\nAlexander III. in Russia, and met Baron Humboldt at Potsdam, from whom\r\nhe received a large photograph of himself, on which he wrote in French:\r\n\"To Mr. S. F. B. Morse, whose philosophic and useful labors have\r\nrendered his name illustrious in two worlds. The homage of the high and\r\naffectionate esteem of Alexander Humboldt.\" After also visiting his\r\ndaughter in the West Indies, his return to Poughkeepsie in 1859 was made\r\nby the people a time of rejoicing. Crowds flocked to the station to\r\nwelcome him. The children of the public schools joined in the\r\nprocession, while bells rung, flags waved, and bands played, as they\r\nfollowed the carriage of Professor Morse to the gateway of his\r\nresidence, which had been festooned with flowers and evergreens. Was\r\never a man more honored? The world loves heroes, though it takes very\r\nlittle pains to help men or women to achieve greatness.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, Morse crossed the ocean again to give his children the\r\nopportunity of study abroad. He was now seventy-five years old, yet\r\nseemingly as vigorous as ever. At the Paris Exposition he was one of the\r\ncommittee upon telegraphic instruments. At Duesseldorf, he was received\r\nwith great enthusiasm by the artists of the city. He purchased there\r\nfive valuable pictures, as he was now in circumstances to be a patron of\r\nart. He also purchased Allston's celebrated painting of \"Jeremiah,\" for\r\nseven thousand dollars, and gave it to Yale College; a portrait of\r\nAllston, at five hundred dollars, he presented to the Academy of Design.\r\nThus did he remember the man who had been his friend in his young\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\nMorse also gave to the Union Theological Seminary, in the city of New\r\nYork, ten thousand dollars, endowing a lectureship on the \"Relation of\r\nthe Bible to the Sciences,\" named in honor of his father.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, a public dinner was given Professor Morse in New York, by the\r\ndistinguished men of the day. Chief Justice Chase presided, and made an\r\nable address. After recounting the discoveries of others in electricity,\r\n\"not least illustrious among these illustrious men, our countryman\r\nHenry,\" he said: \"And it is the providential distinction and splendid\r\nhonor of the eminent American who is our guest to-night that, happily\r\nprepared by previous acquirements and pursuits, he was quick to seize\r\nthe opportunity, and give to the world the first recording telegraph.\r\nFortunate man! thus to link his name forever with the greatest wonder\r\nand the greatest benefit of the age!\" Other addresses were made by\r\nBryant, Evarts, and many prominent men.\r\n\r\nIn 1871, June 10, a bronze statue of Professor Morse was unveiled in\r\nCentral Park, the money for it being raised, in small amounts, from\r\ntelegraphic operatives all over the country. In the evening, a brilliant\r\nreception was tendered him in the Academy of Music, the following\r\ndespatch being sent on his ORIGINAL register: \"GREETING AND THANKS TO\r\nTHE TELEGRAPHIC FRATERNITY THROUGHOUT THE LAND. GLORY TO GOD IN THE\r\nHIGHEST, ON EARTH PEACE, GOOD-WILL TO MEN.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the white-haired Morse, now eighty years old, took his seat at\r\nthe instrument, and signed his name to his message--\"S. F. B. Morse.\"\r\nThe entire audience rose and cheered, and many eyes filled with tears,\r\nas he gave his farewell address.\r\n\r\nThe last time Mr. Morse appeared in public was when he unveiled the\r\nstatue of Benjamin Franklin in Printing-House Square, in front of the\r\nCity Hall, January 17, 1872.\r\n\r\nDeath came in a few weeks. To his pastor, Rev. Dr. Adams, he said in\r\nresponse to a remark concerning the goodness of God to him in the past,\r\n\"The best is yet to come.\"\r\n\r\nNear the last, when the physicians were inspecting his lungs, and\r\ntapping upon his breast, one said, \"This is the way we doctors\r\ntelegraph.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said the dying man, and passed away, April 2, 1872.\r\n\r\nHe was buried with distinguished honors from Madison Square Presbyterian\r\nChurch, New York. Scientific, philanthropic, and religious institutions\r\neverywhere adopted resolutions of respect for his memory. A solemn\r\nservice was held in the hall of the House of the Representatives at\r\nWashington, April 16, with appropriate addresses from Garfield and\r\nothers. An oil painting of Professor Morse hung in front of the main\r\ngallery, surrounded by the historic words, \"What hath God wrought!\"\r\nTelegraphic messages were sent from Europe, Asia, and Africa, to this\r\nmemorial meeting. Did any of those present remember how Congress allowed\r\nhim nearly to die of despair and want, only a few years before? Truly a\r\nlife that reads like a romance, in its misfortunes and its fortunes!\r\nThrough all the days of poverty, as well as prosperity, Morse preserved\r\nhis earnest Christian character, and his childlike, tender, loving\r\nnature. Trials did not embitter him, as they sometimes do, and honors\r\ndid not exalt him above his fellows. American history does not furnish a\r\nmore sublime illustration of faith in God and indomitable perseverance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR CHARLES LYELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nGalileo studied and found out the truth that the earth moves around the\r\nsun, and died recanting it.\r\n\r\nBuffon, the great French naturalist, studied, and ascertained that the\r\nearth has been subject to changes which must have required millions of\r\nyears. He wrote: \"The waters of the sea have produced the mountains and\r\nvalleys of the land--the waters of the heavens, reducing all to a level,\r\nwill at last deliver the whole land over to the sea, and the sea,\r\nsuccessively prevailing over the land, will leave dry new continents\r\nlike those which we inhabit.\"\r\n\r\nHe was at once summoned before the Faculty of Theology in Paris to\r\nrecant his opinions, saying, \"I declare that I had no intention to\r\ncontradict the text of Scripture; that I believe most firmly all therein\r\nrelated about the creation, both as to order of time and matter of fact;\r\n_I abandon everything in my book respecting the formation of the earth_,\r\nand, generally, all which may be contrary to the narration of Moses.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR CHARLES LYELL.]\r\n\r\nA little more than a century later, at Kinnordy, Forfarshire, Scotland,\r\na boy was born, Charles Lyell, who was destined not only to make\r\ngeology as fascinating to the world as a novel, but to prove more fully\r\nand conclusively than any one had previously done that the world is not\r\nonly six thousand years old, but perhaps six thousand million years old;\r\nand that man has lived here not for a few centuries only, but for\r\nthousands of centuries. Lyell knew and felt what the Christian world has\r\ncome to feel, that truth must and will stand, and that there is no real\r\nconflict between science and religion.\r\n\r\nCharles Lyell, the eldest of ten children, having two brothers and seven\r\nsisters, was born November 14, 1797. He had the early training of an\r\neducated and refined father, a man who had devoted himself to the study\r\nof botany, and written several works on Dante. The mother was a woman of\r\npractical common-sense, and from her, doubtless, Charles inherited that\r\ngood judgment which characterized all his work and life.\r\n\r\nAt seven the child was sent to Ringwood, to a school kept by Rev. R. S.\r\nDavies. Here, being the youngest, and one of the gentlest, he was spared\r\nthe roughness too often found in boys' schools. At ten he and his\r\nbrother Tom were sent to a school in Salisbury, sixteen miles from\r\nBartley Lodge, whither the family had moved from Kinnordy.\r\n\r\nThough they missed their favorite sport of hay-making, they enjoyed\r\nwalks to Old Sarum, a famous camp of Roman times. Here the boys amused\r\nthemselves by heaping up piles of chalk flints on the opposite ridges,\r\nand letting them roll down, and dash against each other like two armies.\r\n\r\nThe teacher, Dr. Radcliffe, was called \"Bluebeard,\" from having his\r\nfourth wife. The boys, however, liked him, because he had the rare merit\r\nof being impartial, while they were never tired of annoying another\r\nteacher, who had his favorites. Says Lyell of these early days,\r\n\"Monsieur Borelle's room was within one in which I and eight others\r\nslept. One night, when we were very angry with him for having spatted us\r\nall round with a ruler, for a noise in the schoolroom which only _one_\r\nhad made, and no one would confess, we determined to be revenged. We\r\nbalanced a great weight of heavy volumes on the top of the door, so that\r\nno one could open it without their falling on his head. He was caught\r\nlike a mouse in a trap, and threw a book in a rage at each boy's head,\r\nas they lay shamming sound asleep.\r\n\r\n\"Another stratagem of mine and young Prescott (son of Sir G. P.) was to\r\ntie a string across the room from the legs of two beds, so as to trip\r\nhim up; from this string others branched off, the ends of which were\r\nfixed to the great toes of two sound sleepers, so that when Monsieur\r\ndrew the lines, they woke, making a great outcry. At last we wearied him\r\nout, and he went and slept elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"I conclude that there were far too many hours allotted to sleep at this\r\nschool, for at all others we were glad to sleep after the labors of the\r\nday, and got punished for late rising in the morning, and being too\r\nlate for roll-call. Here, on the contrary, a great many of our best\r\nsports were at night, particularly one, which, as very unique and one\r\nwhich lasted all the time I was there, I must describe. It consisted of\r\nfighting, either in single combat, or whole rooms against others, with\r\n_bolsters_. These were shaken until all the contents were at one end,\r\nand then they were kept there by a girth of string or stockings. This\r\nmade a formidable weapon, the empty end being the handle, and the ball\r\nat the other would hit a good blow, or coil round a fellow's leg, and by\r\na jerk pull him up so that he fell backwards.... The invading party were\r\nalways to station a watch at the head of the stairs, to give notice of\r\nthe approach of 'Bluebeard,' for he was particularly severe against this\r\nwarfare, though he never succeeded in putting it down. He used to come\r\nup with a cane, which, as none were clothed, took dire effect on those\r\ncaught out of bed. He had a fortunate twist in his left foot, which made\r\nhis step recognizable at a distance, and his shoe to creak loudly. This\r\noffence was high treason, not only because it led to broken heads, and\r\nmade a horrible row in the night, but because Mrs. Radcliffe found that\r\nit made her _bolsters_ wear out most rapidly.\"\r\n\r\nCharles grew ill at Salisbury, and was taken home for three months. \"I\r\nbegan,\" he says, \"to get annoyed with _ennui_, which did not improve my\r\nhealth, for I was always most exceedingly miserable if unemployed,\r\nthough I had an excessive aversion to work unless forced to it. It\r\nhappened that, a little before this time, my father had for a short time\r\nexchanged botany for entomology, a fit which only lasted just long\r\nenough to induce him to purchase some books on the latter subject, after\r\nwhich he threw it up; principally, I believe, from a dislike to kill the\r\ninsects. I did not like this _department_ of the subject either....\r\n\r\n\"Collecting insects was just the sort of desultory occupation which\r\nsuited me at that time, as it gave sufficient employment to my mind and\r\nbody, was full of variety, and to see a store continually increasing\r\ngratified what in the cant phrase of the phrenologist is termed the\r\n'accumulative propensity.' I soon began to know what was rare, and to\r\nappreciate specimens by this test. In the evenings I used to look over\r\n'Donovan's Insects,' a work in which a great number of the British\r\nspecies are well given in colored plates, but which has no scientific\r\nmerit. This was a royal road of arriving at the names, and required no\r\nstudy, but mere looking at pictures. At first I confined my attention to\r\nthe Lepidoptera (butterflies, moths, etc.), as the most beautiful, but\r\nsoon became fond of watching the singular habits of the aquatic insects,\r\nand used to sit whole mornings by a pond, feeding them with flies, and\r\ncatching them if I could.\r\n\r\n\"I had no companion to share this hobby with me, no one to encourage me\r\nin following it up, yet my love for it continued always to increase,\r\nand it afforded a most varied source of amusement.... Instead of\r\nsympathy, I received from almost every one else beyond my home either\r\nridicule, or hints that the pursuits of other boys were more manly....\r\nThe disrepute in which my hobby was held had a considerable effect upon\r\nmy character, for I was very sensitive of the good opinions of others,\r\nand therefore followed it up almost by stealth; so that, although I\r\nnever confessed to myself that I was wrong, but always reasoned myself\r\ninto a belief that the generality of people were too stupid to\r\ncomprehend the interest of such pursuits; yet, I got too much in the\r\nhabit of avoiding being seen, as if I was ashamed of what I did.\"\r\n\r\nThe temporary ill-health of the schoolboy led to the long hours of\r\nobservation of nature; these led to a devotion to science, which brought\r\na worldwide fame. Thus, often, that which seems a hindrance in life\r\nproves a blessing in the end.\r\n\r\nAt twelve, Charles was placed in a school where there were seventy boys,\r\nwith much fagging and fighting. That this roughness was not in\r\naccordance with his noble and refined nature is shown by his words,\r\nyears afterwards: \"Whatever some may say or sing of the happy\r\nrecollections of their school days, I believe the generality, if they\r\ntold the truth, would not like to have them over again, or would\r\nconsider them as less happy than those which follow.... The recollection\r\nof it makes me bless my stars I have not to go through it again.\r\n\r\n\"My ambition,\" he says, \"during the second half-year was excited by\r\nfinding myself rising near the top of a class of fifteen boys in which I\r\nwas; and when miserable, as I often was, with the kicks and cuffs I\r\nreceived, I got into a useful habit of thinking myself happy when I got\r\na high number in the class-paper.\" Each year he received a prize for\r\nspeaking, and often prizes for Latin and English original composition.\r\n\r\nAt seventeen young Lyell entered Exeter College, Oxford. He still\r\ndevoted many hours to entomology, and took some honors in classics. A\r\nbook, as is often the case, had already helped to shape his life. He had\r\nfound and read, in his father's library, Bakewell's \"Geology,\" and was\r\ngreatly excited over the views there expressed about the antiquity of\r\nthe earth. Dr. Buckland, Professor of Geology at Oxford, was then at the\r\nheight of his fame, and Lyell at once attended a course of his lectures\r\nand took notes.\r\n\r\nCollege life was having its influence over the youth, for he wrote to\r\nhis father: \"It is the seeing the superiority of others that convinces\r\none how much is to be and must be done to get any fame; and it is this\r\nwhich spurs the emulation, and feeds that 'Atmosphere of Learning,'\r\nwhich Sir Joshua Reynolds admirably describes as 'floating round all\r\npublic institutions, and which even the idle often breathe in, and then\r\nwonder how they came by it.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet Lyell, like most students, found it a difficult matter to\r\ndecide what was best for a life-pursuit. His father wished him to study\r\nlaw. In reply, the son says: \"As for the confidence and quickness which\r\nyou were speaking of, as one of the chief requisites of the Bar, I don't\r\nknow whether intercourse with the world will supply it, but God knows, I\r\nhave little enough of it now in company.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his college course, Lyell made a journey with some friends to\r\nStaffa, and wrote a poem upon the place, and then, with his parents and\r\nhis eldest sisters, travelled in France, Switzerland, and Italy. Here,\r\nin the midst of art and beautiful scenery, his mind still turned toward\r\nscience. He thought the collections in comparative anatomy in the Jardin\r\ndes Plantes, in Paris, would tempt any one to \"take up ardently the\r\nstudy of anatomy.\" In Cuvier's lecture-room, filled with fossil remains,\r\nhe found \"three glorious relics of a former world, which have added\r\nseveral new genera to the Mammalia.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Jura chain he concluded the limestone to be \"of a different age\r\nfrom what we passed through before Dijon, for the latter abounded in\r\norganic remains, whereas I could not discover one fossil in the Jura. By\r\nthe roadside I picked up many beautiful petrifactions, which must be\r\nforming daily here, where the water is charged plentifully with lime.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rock of the Col de Balme,\" he said, \"is a brown, ligneous slate,\r\nwith some veins of white quartz intersecting it: the appearance is very\r\ncurious. On the top was the richest carpet of turf I ever saw, spangled\r\nwith thousands of the deep blue gentian, red trefoil, and other mountain\r\nflowers.\" Nothing said about law, but much about rocks!\r\n\r\nAt twenty-two Lyell graduated from Oxford. The same year he became a\r\nFellow of the Geological Society of London, and also of the Linnaean\r\nSociety, and, in accordance with his father's preference, began the\r\nstudy of law in London.\r\n\r\nBut the way to success is almost never easy. Lyell's eyes became very\r\nweak, and he was obliged to desist from reading, and go to Rome with his\r\nfather. Many a young man, well-to-do, would have given up a profession,\r\npreferring a life of leisure. Not so Charles Lyell. On his return he\r\ninspected Romney Marsh, an extensive tract of land, formerly covered by\r\nthe sea, and also the Isle of Wight, and wrote his first scientific\r\npaper on the geology of some rivers near his native place in\r\nForfarshire. At twenty-six he was made secretary of the Geological\r\nSociety. Already such men as Dr. Buckland felt the deepest interest in\r\nthe enterprising young student, who was devoting himself to original\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nAnd now he was going to Paris, to perfect himself in French. Dr.\r\nBuckland and others gave him letters of introduction to such persons as\r\nHumboldt and Cuvier. Fortunate young Lyell! Such men would fan the flame\r\nof aspiration to a white heat.\r\n\r\nOnce in Paris, the stimulus of great minds did its accustomed\r\nwork--developed and beautified another mind. He attended a levee at\r\nAlexander Brongniart's, \"who among the English geologists has the\r\nhighest reputation both for knowledge and agreeable manners of all the\r\nFrench _savans_,\" he wrote home to his father. Again he wrote: \"My\r\nreception at Cuvier's last Saturday will make me feel myself at liberty\r\nto attend his _soirees_ next week, and they are a great treat. He was\r\nvery polite, and invited me to attend the Institute on Monday. There he\r\nintroduced me to several geologists, and put me in an excellent place\r\nfor hearing....\r\n\r\n\"Humboldt addressed me, as Duvau had done, with, 'I have the honor of\r\nbeing familiar with your name, as your father has labored with no small\r\nsuccess in botany, particularly the cryptogamiae....' He was not a little\r\ninterested in hearing me detail the critiques which our geologists have\r\nmade on his last geological work,--a work which would give him a rank in\r\nscience if he had never published aught besides. He made me a present of\r\nhis work, and I was surprised to find how much he has investigated the\r\ndetails of our English strata.... He appears to work hard at astronomy,\r\nand lives in a garret for the sake of that study. The King of Prussia\r\ninvited him to adorn his court at the last Congress; thence he went to\r\nVesuvius just after the grand eruption, and brought away much geological\r\ninformation on that head, which he was good enough to communicate to\r\nme. He speaks English well. I attend lectures at the Jardin du Roi, on\r\nmining, geology, chemistry, and zooelogy, all gratis! by the first\r\nmen.... I have promised Humboldt to pass the afternoon to-day in his\r\nstudy. His new edition serves as a famous lesson to me, in the\r\ncomparison of England and the Continent. There are few heroes who lose\r\nso little by being approached as Humboldt.\"\r\n\r\nWho shall estimate the value of such a friendship to a young man! It was\r\na foregone conclusion that Lyell and Agassiz and Liebig, and others, who\r\nsought the society of such as Humboldt, and were _willing to work_,\r\nwould come to greatness.\r\n\r\nCuvier introduced Lyell to Professor Van Breda of Ghent, who gave him\r\nletters to all the Dutch universities,--Ghent, Amsterdam, Haarlem, and\r\nLeyden.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1824, Lyell made a geological tour with M. Constant\r\nPrevost, a noted French geologist, from London to Bristol and Land's\r\nEnd, and with Dr. Buckland, in Scotland, where they dined with the\r\nfar-famed Francis Jeffrey, editor of the \"Edinburgh Review.\" Lyell's\r\neyes still troubled him so that he could scarcely write letters home;\r\nbut he was laying up a store of knowledge from which the world was to\r\nprofit in a few years.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, his eyes having improved, he resumed his law study, and was\r\nadmitted to the bar. But he could not give up geological work, and\r\npublished several papers,--one on a dike of serpentine, another on\r\nshell marl and fossil fruit, and others on plastic clay in Hampshire and\r\nthe fresh-water strata of Hants. He had been made a Fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety at twenty-nine, and was one of the writers in the \"Quarterly\r\nReview.\"\r\n\r\nThe law work went on, but it was easy to see where his heart was. He\r\nwrote a friend that he had been \"devouring\" Lamarck: \"That the earth is\r\nquite as old as he supposes has long been my creed, and I will try\r\nbefore six months are over to convert the readers of the 'Quarterly' to\r\nthat heterodox opinion.... Buckland has got a letter from India about\r\nmodern hyaenas, whose manners, habitations, diet, etc., are everything he\r\ncould wish, and as much as could be expected had they attended regularly\r\nthree courses of his lectures.\"\r\n\r\nAt thirty-one Lyell had made up his mind \"that there is most real\r\nindependence in that class of society who, possessing moderate means,\r\nare engaged in literary and scientific hobbies;\" he had given up the\r\nlaw, and planned the book that was to make him famous--\"Principles of\r\nGeology.\" He travelled now extensively in Italy and France, studying\r\nvolcanoes, glaciers, and fossils. At Auvergne, he began work with his\r\ndear friend Murchison at six o'clock in the morning, \"and neither heat\r\nnor fatigue has stopped us an hour,\" he writes to his parents. \"I have\r\nreally gained strength so much, that I believe that I and my eyes were\r\nnever in such a condition before; and I am sure that six hours in bed,\r\nwhich is all we allow, and exercise all day long for the body, and\r\ngeology for the mind, ... is the best thing that can be invented in this\r\nworld for my health and happiness.\"\r\n\r\nEighteen hours of labor daily, and yet he was happy! He had found his\r\nlife-work now. To a sister he writes about the beetles at Aix. He cannot\r\nbe laughed out of this study as when a boy. He has been to Parma, to see\r\nProfessor Guidotti's \"finest collection of fossil-shells in Italy, ...\r\nspending three days, from six o'clock in the morning till night,\r\nexchanging our respective commodities.\"\r\n\r\nTo his sisters he writes all his discoveries in rocks and fossils, with\r\nthe enthusiasm of a boy. \"I rode to the upper Val d'Arno,--a famous day\r\nfor me,--an old lacustrine deposit, corresponding delightfully with our\r\nAngus lakes in all but age and _species_ of animals; same genera of\r\nshells. They have just extracted the fortieth skeleton of hippopotamus;\r\nhave got about twenty elephants, one or two mastodons, a rhinoceros and\r\nstags, and oxen out of number.... At Rome I found the geology of the\r\ncity itself exceedingly interesting. The celebrated seven hills, of\r\nwhich you have read, and which in fact are nine, are caused by the Tiber\r\nand some tributaries, which have cut open valleys almost entirely\r\nthrough volcanic ejected matter, covered by travertine containing\r\nlacustrine shells.\"\r\n\r\nHe made the ascent of Etna, and sketched the crater. \"Inside the\r\ncrater, near the lip, were huge masses of ice, between which and the\r\nscoriae and lava of the crater issued hot sulphurous vapors, which I\r\nbreathed in copiously; and for six hours after I could not, even after\r\neating and drinking, get the horrid taste out of my mouth, for my lungs\r\nhad got full of it. The wind was so high, that the guide held my hat\r\nwhile I drew; but though the head was cold, my feet got so hot in the\r\ncinders, that I was often alarmed that my boots would be burnt.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1830, the first volume of \"Principles of Geology, being an Attempt to\r\nExplain the Former Changes of the Earth's Surface by Reference to Causes\r\nnow in Operation,\" was published. \"It will not pretend,\" he wrote to\r\nMurchison, \"to give even an abstract of all that is known in geology,\r\nbut it will endeavor to establish the _principles_ of _reasoning_ in the\r\nscience; and all my geology will come in as illustration of my views of\r\nthose principles, and as evidence strengthening the system necessarily\r\narising out of the admission of such principles, which, as you know, are\r\nneither more nor less than that _no causes whatever_ have from the\r\nearliest time to which we can look back, to the present, ever acted, but\r\nthose _now acting_.... I must go to Germany.... Their language must be\r\nlearnt; the places to which their memoirs relate, visited; and then you\r\nmay see, as I may, to what extent we may indulge dreams of eminence, at\r\nleast as original observers.\" He, too, like all the other great ones,\r\nindulged in \"dreams of eminence.\" Did ever man or woman achieve anything\r\nworthy without these dreams?\r\n\r\nHe had worked earnestly upon the \"Principles,\" which showed wonderful\r\nresearch, study, and thought. He said, \"The facts which are given in a\r\nfew sentences require weeks of reading to obtain.... By the aid of a\r\ngood amanuensis, my eyes hold out well.\"\r\n\r\nThe sale of the book was large and satisfactory. It was, of course,\r\nopposed, from its advanced views as to the age of the world, but Lyell\r\nwisely made no reply. He said, \"I have sworn to myself that I will not\r\ngo to the expense of giving time to combat in controversy. It is an\r\ninterminable work.\" A great lesson, learned early.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 he visited Germany. Now he wrote home not only to his family,\r\nbut to another, who was hereafter to brighten and beautify his\r\nlife--Mary Horner, the daughter of a prominent scientist. To great\r\npersonal beauty she added unusual mental ability. Wise man indeed was\r\nCharles Lyell to have known, what some fail to know beforehand, that\r\nintellect demands intellect for the best companionship.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to her: \"I am sure you will work at it\" (the German language)\r\n\"with more zeal if you believe you can help me by it, as I labor with\r\ngreater spirit, now that I regard myself as employed for you as well as\r\nfor myself. Not that I am at all sanguine about the pecuniary profits\r\nthat I shall ever reap, but I feel that if I could have fair play for\r\nthe next ten years, I could gain a reputation that would make a moderate\r\nincome for the latter part of my life, yield me a command of society,\r\nand a respect that would entitle me to rest a little on my oars, and\r\nenable me to help somewhat those I love.... As to geology having _half_\r\nof my heart, I hope I shall be able to give my _whole_ soul to it, with\r\nthat enthusiasm by which alone any advance can be made in any science,\r\nor, indeed, in any profession.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1832 Lyell was made professor of geology in King's College, London,\r\nwhich position he resigned later, because he wished \"the power of\r\ncommanding _time_ to increase his knowledge and fame.\" This year also,\r\nJuly 12, when he was thirty-five, he was married to Mary Horner, and\r\nmade a tour up the valley of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe earnest life was now more earnest and busy than ever. He said, \"I am\r\nnever so happy as when, at the end of a week, I feel I have employed\r\nevery day in a manner that will tell to the rest of my life.\" Would that\r\nall of us could live after so noble a plan!\r\n\r\n\"Unless I can feel that I am working to some decided end, such as that\r\nof fame, money, or partly both, I cannot be quite happy, or cannot feel\r\na stimulus to that strenuous application without which I should not\r\nremain content.\" He had learned what \"strenuous application\" means, and\r\nknew that there is no success without it. When congratulated by his\r\nfriends \"in not looking older for his hard work,\" he said, \"The way to\r\ndo much and not grow old is, to be moderate in not going out, to work a\r\nfew hours, or half-hours, at a time, ... and to go to bed at eleven\r\no'clock.\" He would not accept many invitations socially. \"A man should\r\nhave some severity of character, and be able to refuse invitations,\r\netc.,\" he said. \"The fact is, that to become great in science, a man\r\nmust be nearly as devoted as a lawyer, and must have more than mere\r\ntalent.... I think I never do so much as when I have fought a battle not\r\nto go out.\" Those who have written books will appreciate this statement,\r\nand recall the many days when they have closed the shutters and worked,\r\nthough they longed to be out-of-doors in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, the year after his marriage, he gave by invitation a course of\r\nseven lectures before the Royal Institution, a high honor. In 1834, he\r\npassed several months in Sweden, and wrote back to his \"dearest\r\nMary,\"--\"I have been ten hours without a word with my love, but thinking\r\nof her more than half the time, and comforting myself that she is less\r\nalone than I am.\" ... He kept a journal for her of his daily work.\r\n\r\n\"It is now twenty-five days that we have been separated, and I have\r\noften thought of what you said, that the active occupation in which I\r\nshould constantly be engaged would give me a great advantage over you. I\r\ntrust, however, that you also have been actively employed. At leisure\r\nmoments I have done some things towards planning my next volume. It will\r\nbe necessary for us to have a work together at fossils at Kinnordy,\r\nfirst, and then in town, and then in Paris.\" Thus fully had the young\r\nwife entered into his studies.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, having received the gold medal of the Royal Society, for his\r\n\"Principles of Geology,\"--now in its fourth edition, which Sir John\r\nHerschel said he had read three times,--he was elected president of the\r\nGeological Society of London, and made extensive researches in\r\nSwitzerland, Germany, and Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, already famous as well as beloved, Lyell was invited to give\r\ntwelve lectures before the Lowell Institute, in Boston. He and his wife\r\nspent thirteen months in the United States, studying the country\r\ngeologically; its social life, its politics, and our benevolent and\r\neducational institutions. Between two and three thousand persons came,\r\nboth morning and evening, to listen to the distinguished scholar, who\r\nhad travelled almost the world over to study his beloved science.\r\n\r\nClose friendships were formed with some of our most prominent men, like\r\nPrescott and Ticknor. Lyell visited the great lakes, and compared the\r\nsupposed ancient boundaries of Lake Ontario, when it was one hundred and\r\nfifty feet higher, with its present shore. He made a careful study of\r\nNiagara Falls, which cuts its deep gorge toward Lake Ontario, for seven\r\nmiles, and estimated that it wore away a foot a year. If so, he argued\r\nthat at least thirty-five thousand years have passed since the river\r\nbegan to cut its passage between the high rocky walls. \"What would I\r\ngive,\" said Lyell, \"for a daguerrotype of the scene as it was four\r\nthousand, and again forty thousand years ago! Even four centuries would\r\nhave been very important.\" Authorities differ as to the rate of the\r\nrecession of the falls. Some estimate an inch instead of a foot yearly,\r\nrequiring a period of more than four hundred thousand years.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, Lyell published his \"Travels in North America, with Geological\r\nObservations,\" and in September of the same year, returned again to our\r\ncountry, spending nine months in travel and study, and bringing out\r\nlater, in 1849, his \"Second Visit to the United States of North\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nAlready his \"Elements of Geology\" had appeared, which went through\r\nseveral editions. A seventh edition of the \"Principles\" had been\r\npublished. He had also been knighted by the Queen, for his rare\r\nscholarship. Honored at home and abroad, working ardently and earnestly,\r\noften with failing sight, he had already won for himself the eminence of\r\nwhich he had dared to dream years before.\r\n\r\nOf course he was welcomed at all great gatherings. Macaulay and Hallam,\r\nMilmore and Mrs. Somerville, Rogers, and scores of others were often at\r\nhis home.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, he was appointed one of the Royal Commissioners for the first\r\nGreat Exhibition held in Hyde Park, London, and a year later gave a\r\nsecond course of lectures at the Lowell Institute, Boston. So kindly and\r\ncordially had he written concerning us and our country, that he received\r\nthe heartiest welcome. He had carried out in his life what he wrote to\r\nbeautiful Mary Horner, twenty years before: \"I hope we shall both of us\r\ncontrive to cultivate a disposition--which David Hume said was better\r\nthan a fortune of one thousand pounds a year--to look on the bright side\r\nof things. I think I shall, and I believe you will.\" The sweet-natured\r\nand great-minded man had looked on the bright side of America, and seen\r\nthe good rather than the evil. He believed in our future. When Prescott\r\ndied, to whom he was devotedly attached, he said: \"From such a soil and\r\nin such an atmosphere, great literary men must continue to spring up.\"\r\n\r\nAll through our Civil War, he had known and loved us so well, that he\r\nwas, like John Bright, our constant advocate. He deprecated the course\r\nof some of the English newspapers. \"The integrity of the empire,\" he\r\nsaid, \"and the non-extension and for the last two years the extinction\r\nof slavery constitute to my mind better grounds for a protracted\r\nstruggle than those for which any war in our time, perhaps in all\r\nhistory, has been waged.... I am in hopes that the struggle in America\r\nwill rid the country in the course of twenty years of that great curse\r\nto the whites, slave labor, and, if so, it may be worth all it will cost\r\nin blood and treasure....\"\r\n\r\n\"Had the States been dismembered, there would have been endless wars,\r\nmore activity than ever in breeding slaves in America, and a renewal of\r\nthe African slave-trade, and the future course of civilization retarded\r\nin that continent in a degree which would not, in my judgment, be\r\ncounterbalanced by any adequate advantage which Europe would gain by the\r\nUnited States becoming relatively less strong.... I believe that if a\r\nsmall number of our statesmen had seen what I had seen of America, they\r\nwould not have allowed their wishes for dismemberment to have biassed\r\ntheir judgment of the issue so much.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1853, at the request of his government, he came to New York, as one\r\nof the commissioners to the International Exhibition. Of course, now,\r\nwherever he travelled, either in Europe or America, he met the\r\ndistinguished, and was honored by them. He was the friend of Berzelius,\r\nthe noted chemist of Sweden, and of the great Liebig of Germany.\r\nProfessor Bunsen of Heidelberg said, that all his taste for geology had\r\nbeen derived from Lyell's books.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years, he was much in Holland, France, and Germany,\r\npreparing for the publication of another great work in 1863, the\r\n\"Antiquity of Man.\" He had made a careful study of the ancient Swiss\r\nLake-dwellings, erected on piles in the midst of the water, connected\r\nwith the land by bridges. On Lake Neuchatel it is estimated that there\r\nwere more than forty such circular houses. At Wangen, near Stein, on\r\nLake Constance, it is believed forty thousand piles were used. Some five\r\nthousand objects have been found, comprising flax, not woven, but\r\nplaited; carbonized wheat, and the bones of the dog, ox, sheep, and\r\ngoat. The arrow-heads, hatchets, and the like, belong to the stone age,\r\nwhich geologists place, at the least, seven thousand years ago. At\r\nZurich one human skull was found belonging to this early stone age. No\r\ntraveller should pass through Zurich without seeing these memorials of a\r\npeople who lived in the dawn of civilization, when the world was being\r\nmade ready for the more perfect man.\r\n\r\nLyell had studied also the Danish \"kitchen-middens,\" familiar to those\r\nwho have been carefully over the museums at Copenhagen. These\r\nshell-mounds, the refuse heaps of this ancient race, are sometimes one\r\nthousand feet long and two hundred wide. As far back as the time of the\r\nRomans the Danish isles were covered with magnificent beech forests. In\r\nthe bronze age there were no beech trees, but oaks. In the stone age the\r\nScotch fir prevailed, and thousands of years must have elapsed while\r\nthese giant forests succeeded each other.\r\n\r\nThe delta and alluvial plain of the Mississippi Lyell found to consist\r\nof sediment covering an area of thirty thousand square miles, several\r\nhundred feet deep. Taking the amount deposited annually, it would\r\nrequire from fifty to one hundred thousand years to produce the present\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nThe coral reefs of Florida, built up at the rate of one foot in a\r\ncentury, each reef adding ten miles to the coast, have required,\r\naccording to Agassiz, at least one hundred and thirty-five thousand\r\nyears for building. Human remains in a bluff on the shores of Lake\r\nMonroe, in Florida, he shows to be at least ten thousand years old.\r\n\r\nUnder the streets of Glasgow, Scotland, seventeen canoes have been dug\r\nup, one in a vertical position, as if it had sunk in a storm, with the\r\nprow uppermost. Twelve canoes one hundred yards back from the river were\r\nfound nineteen feet beneath the surface. Almost all were single oak\r\ntrees, hollowed out by blunt tools, probably stone axes, aided by fire,\r\nrelics of the stone age.\r\n\r\nIn caverns near Liege, France, human bones have been found, with the\r\ncave-bear, elephant, rhinoceros, and other species now extinct. Skulls\r\nfound in these primeval caves, especially one near Duesseldorf, called\r\nthe \"Neanderthal,\" \"is the most brutal of all known human skulls,\r\nresembling those of the apes.\" These rude men probably were living at\r\nthe same time, or even later, than the makers of the \"refuse heaps\" of\r\nDenmark.\r\n\r\nWales has been under the sea to the depth of fourteen hundred feet, as\r\nproved by glacial shells; its submergence and reelevation would require,\r\nby careful computation, about two hundred and twenty-four thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nLyell showed that the Alps, Andes, and Himalaya Mountains were all\r\nelaborated under water. \"The Alps have acquired four thousand, and even,\r\nin some places, more than ten thousand feet of their present altitude\r\nsince the commencement of the Eocene (dawn of recent) period.... It is\r\nnot too much to say that every spot which is now dry land has been sea\r\nat some former period, and every part of the space now covered by the\r\ndeepest ocean has been land. The present distribution of land and water\r\nencourages us to believe that almost every conceivable transformation in\r\nthe external form of the earth's crust may have been gone through. In\r\none epoch the land may have been chiefly equatorial; in another, for the\r\nmost part polar and circumpolar.\"\r\n\r\nLyell showed also the great age of the world by the changes which have\r\ntaken place in climate. In Greenland are a multitude of fossil plants,\r\nwhich show that it formerly enjoyed a mild and genial climate. Fossil\r\ntulip and walnut trees have been found within the Arctic circle.\r\n\r\n\"On the North American continent, between the Arctic circle and the\r\nforty-second parallel of latitude,\" said Lyell, \"we meet with signs of\r\nice-action on a scale as grand, if not grander than in Europe.\" The\r\ndrift covered from the Atlantic border of New England and Labrador\r\nwestward to Dakota and Lake Winnipeg, and farther north, across the\r\ncontinent. Some stones in this bed of ice were thirty feet square,\r\nweighing over four million pounds. Some boulders from the Alps,\r\nweighing three thousand tons each, are now found on the Juras. \"It must,\r\nI think,\" said Lyell, \"be conceded that the period required for the\r\ncoming-on of the greatest cold, and for its duration when most intense,\r\nand the oscillations to which it was subject, as well as the retreat of\r\nthe glaciers and the 'great thaw,' or disappearance of snow, from many\r\nmountain-chains where the snow was once perpetual, required not tens,\r\nbut hundreds, of thousands of years.\"\r\n\r\nIn Arctic Siberia herds of elephants must have roamed, as their bodies,\r\ncovered with hair and flesh, have been dug up in recent years. Great\r\nBritain and Europe have been much warmer than now. Our own immense coal\r\nfields show a former tropical climate, with their great tree-ferns and\r\ntree-rushes, while the remains of reindeers have been found in\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Lyell became fascinated with the history of the changes of\r\nthis planet, and the life of man before historic times. A great book\r\nseemed open to him, and he studied it by night and by day: the Archaean\r\nTime--no life; Paleozoic Time, including the Silurian Age, with its\r\nshells and trilobites; the Devonian, with its fishes; Carboniferous,\r\nwith its coal plants; Mesozoic Time, including the Reptilian Age with\r\nits reptiles; Cenozoic Time, including the Mammalian or Tertiary, with\r\nits mammals, and Quaternary, or age of man. Paleozoic means \"ancient\r\nlife;\" Mesozoic, \"middle life;\" Cenozoic, \"recent life.\"\r\n\r\nLyell divided the Tertiary strata into three groups: Eocene, recent\r\ndawn; Miocene, less recent; Pliocene, more recent. In the Eocene Age\r\nGreat Britain was sub-tropical, and, in North America, Vermont was like\r\nNorth Carolina in temperature. Then came the Glacial Period, with ice\r\nprobably five thousand feet thick over New England. Then the Champlain\r\nPeriod, with its floods, continents depressed, and climate warm,\r\nfollowed in Europe by a second Glacial Period.\r\n\r\nThe \"Antiquity of Man\" had an extensive sale. Honors were now showered\r\nupon Sir Charles Lyell. He was offered the Presidency of the Royal\r\nSociety, and a seat in Parliament for the University of London, but\r\ndeclined both. Oxford University had already conferred upon him the\r\ndegree of D. C. L., and the Institute of France had made him\r\ncorresponding member. By request of the queen, he visited her at\r\nOsborne, she having made him a baronet. Emperor William conferred upon\r\nhim the Order of Merit, given also to Humboldt, and the London Royal\r\nSociety, its highest honor, the Copley gold medal.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1873, his \"dearest Mary\" died, leaving him\r\nheart-broken. She was mourned in America as well as Europe. The \"Boston\r\nAdvertiser\" said, \"Strength and sweetness were hers, both in no common\r\nmeasure.... She became to her husband not merely the truest of friends,\r\nand the most affectionate and sympathizing of companions, but a very\r\nefficient helper. She was frank, generous, and true; her moral\r\ninstincts were high and pure; she was faithful and firm in\r\nfriendship.... This woman so widely informed, so true, so strong, so\r\nbrave, seemed all compact of softness, sweetness, and gentleness; a very\r\nflower that had done no more than drink the sunshine and the dew. In her\r\nsmile, her greeting, the tones of her voice, there was a charm which\r\ncannot be described, but which all who knew her have felt and will\r\nrecall.... During the war there was not a woman or a man in England that\r\nstood by the Union and the government more ardently and fearlessly than\r\nshe.\" Lady Lyell was an efficient linguist, and a woman of unusual\r\nmental power. The success of her husband was in part the result of her\r\nlovely character. Had she sought society while he needed quiet for his\r\nwork, had she been fond of dress when their income was limited and\r\nnecessarily used in his extensive travels, his life might have been a\r\nfailure. They had what Tolstoi well calls \"the friendship of the soul;\r\nidentity of sentiment and similarity of ideal.\" Too often in this world\r\npersons marry \"opposites,\" and walk, alas! in opposite directions all\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nLyell now worked on, for he said he must carry out what he had planned\r\nwith _her_. In 1872 the eleventh edition of the \"Principles\" appeared.\r\nLyell, though formerly an opponent, had become convinced of the truth of\r\nevolution, advocated by his devoted friend Darwin, and was proud of our\r\nown distinguished botanist Asa Gray, whose articles, he said, \"were the\r\nablest, and, on the whole, grappling with the subject, both as a\r\nnaturalist and metaphysician, better than any one else on either side of\r\nthe Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\nLyell believed ever in \"an infinite and eternal Being.\" He said, \"In\r\nwhatever direction we pursue our researches, whether in time or space,\r\nwe discover everywhere the clear proofs of a Creative intelligence, and\r\nof his foresight, wisdom, and power.\"\r\n\r\nHe used to quote Professor Agassiz, who said, \"Whenever a new and\r\nstartling fact is brought to light in science, people first say, 'It is\r\nnot true,' then that 'it is contrary to religion,' and lastly that\r\n'everybody knew it before.'\"\r\n\r\nFor the last ten years of his life, unable to use his eyes to any great\r\nextent, Lyell had the assistance, as secretary, of the able author of\r\nthe \"Fairy Land of Science,\" Miss Arabella Buckley, now Mrs. Fisher. And\r\nyet he accomplished more than most people with the best of eyes.\r\n\r\nTwo years after his wife's death, while at work on the twelfth edition\r\nof the \"Principles,\" the end came, February 22, 1875. He was buried in\r\nWestminster Abbey, beside his friend Sir John Herschel,--the Duke of\r\nArgyll, Professor Huxley, and other noted men acting as pall-bearers.\r\nSaid the Dean of Westminster, in the funeral sermon preached in the\r\nAbbey, \"He followed truth with a zeal as sanctified as ever fired the\r\nsoul of a missionary, and with a humility as child-like as ever subdued\r\nthe mind of a simple scholar.... From early youth to extreme old age,\r\nit was to him a solemn religious duty to be incessantly learning,\r\nconstantly growing, fearlessly correcting his own mistakes, always ready\r\nto receive and reproduce from others that which he had not in himself.\r\nScience and religion for him not only were not divorced, but were one\r\nand indivisible.\" Truly said Tyndall, Huxley, and others, \"For the last\r\ntwenty-five years he has been the most prominent geologist in the world;\r\nequally eminent for the extent of his labors and the breadth of his\r\nphilosophical views.\"\r\n\r\nTo the last Sir Charles Lyell kept his affectionate, tender heart, with\r\ngentle and kindly manners. He was fair to his opponents, and\r\nappreciative of all talent. He took time to help others. He urged the\r\nname of Agassiz as the lecturer before the Lowell Institute, Boston, and\r\nwe all know the grand results of his coming. Those who have no time to\r\nhelp others usually fail of help when their own time of need comes.\r\nLyell was singularly free from vanity, egotism, or jealousy. He loved\r\nnature devotedly, the grandeur of the sea especially impressing him; he\r\nnever tired of wandering alone beside it. He had great steadiness of\r\npurpose, and calm judgment. His perseverance was untiring; his power of\r\nwork remarkable; his sympathy boundless. He was never narrow or\r\nopinionated. He died as he had lived; honored the world over for his\r\namazing knowledge, and loved for his unselfish, earnest, and beautiful\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH HENRY, LL.D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH HENRY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Thursday evening, January 16, 1879, a large company gathered in the\r\nhall of the House of Representatives at Washington. They came to honor\r\nthe memory of one of our greatest in science, since Franklin,--Joseph\r\nHenry, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Addresses were made\r\nby the Hon. Hannibal Hamlin, Professor Asa Gray, a most distinguished\r\nscientist, the Hon. James A. Garfield, General W. T. Sherman, the Hon.\r\nS. S. Cox, and others.\r\n\r\nNot alone at the Capitol were memorial services held for Professor\r\nHenry. Before the United States National Academy of Sciences, before the\r\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, before the\r\nPhilosophical Society of Washington,--of all these he had been\r\npresident,--before the College of New Jersey at Princeton, where he was\r\nProfessor of Natural Philosophy for fourteen years, before the Albany\r\nInstitute, of which he was one of the original members, and before\r\nvarious other societies in which he had been a leading spirit, heartfelt\r\ntestimony was given to America's loss in the death of a great scholar\r\nand a good man.\r\n\r\nJoseph Henry was born in Albany, N. Y., December 17, 1797, or 1799,\r\nprobably the latter date, this uncertainty arising from the illegibility\r\nof the faded records in the old family Bible. His grandparents came from\r\nScotland, landing in this country June 16, 1775, the day before the\r\nbattle of Bunker Hill. The father, William Henry, of whom little is\r\nknown, died when his first son, Joseph, was nine years old. The boy had\r\ngone two years previously to live with his maternal grandmother at\r\nGalway, in the county of Saratoga, N. Y.\r\n\r\nJoseph's mother is remembered as a lady of great refinement, delicate in\r\nform and feature, and very beautiful in her youth. She was deeply\r\ndevotional, and probably to this fact is partially due Professor Henry's\r\nearnest religious character through life.\r\n\r\nAt the district school of Galway, under Israel Phelps, Joseph exhibited\r\nno special aptitude for books, though he showed an inquisitive mind. At\r\nthe age of ten, he was placed in a store kept by a Mr. Broderick, who\r\nwas very kind to him, allowing him to attend school in the afternoons.\r\n\r\nHis fondness for reading developed from a singular circumstance. Having\r\nlost a pet rabbit, which had run into an opening in the foundation wall\r\nof the village meeting-house, he crept through the hole on his hands and\r\nknees, to find the runaway. Discovering a light through a crevice,\r\nboy-like, he decided to investigate his surroundings. He soon reached\r\nthe vestibule of the building, and found there a book-case containing\r\nthe village library. The first book which attracted his attention was\r\nBrooke's \"Fool of Quality,\" a work of fiction. He began to read, and\r\nsoon forgot about his rabbit.\r\n\r\nFrom this time he made frequent visits to the library, by the\r\nunderground passage, reading all the novels he could find. In the\r\nevening, to the lads who gathered about the stove in the village store,\r\nhe rehearsed the wonderful things he had read. He was a handsome,\r\nslender lad, of delicate complexion, vivacious manners, and a great\r\nfavorite. Mr. Broderick, the proprietor, enjoyed the stories, and\r\nfinally obtained proper access to the library for his young clerk.\r\n\r\nWhen about thirteen or fourteen, Joseph was apprenticed to Mr. John F.\r\nDoty of Albany, a watch-maker and silversmith. He found very little\r\npleasure in the trade, and was probably glad when, after two years, the\r\napprenticeship came to an end, through Mr. Doty leaving the business.\r\n\r\nOf course he was out of work. He was very fond of the theatre, and,\r\nhaving been behind the scenes, had learned how stage effects are\r\nproduced. He now joined a private theatrical company, called \"The\r\nRostrum,\" and was soon made president of the society. He dramatized a\r\nstory, and wrote a comedy, both of which were acted. He seemed destined\r\nto become an actor, probably not with the approval of his Scotch\r\nPresbyterian mother.\r\n\r\nLives are sometimes changed by seemingly trivial events, yet nothing is\r\ntrivial that influences a human being. Garfield said, \"To every man of\r\ngreat original power there comes, in early youth, a moment of sudden\r\ndiscovery--of self-recognition--when his own nature is revealed to\r\nhimself, when he catches for the first time a strain of that immortal\r\nsong to which his own spirit answers, and which becomes thenceforth and\r\nforever the inspiration of his life.\r\n\r\n  \"'Like noble music unto noble words.'\"\r\n\r\nThat \"moment of sudden discovery\" came to Henry at sixteen. A slight\r\naccident had confined him to his mother's house for a few days. A young\r\nScotch gentleman, Robert Boyle, who was boarding with her, had left upon\r\nthe table of his chamber an unostentatious book, \"Lectures on\r\nExperimental Philosophy, Astronomy, and Chemistry: by G. Gregory, D.D.,\r\nVicar of Westham.\"\r\n\r\nThe book begins by asking several questions: \"You throw a stone, or\r\nshoot an arrow into the air; why does it not go forward in the line or\r\ndirection that you give it? Why does it stop at a certain distance, and\r\nthen return to you?... On the contrary, why does flame or smoke always\r\nmount upward, though no force is used to send them in that direction?\r\nAnd why should not the flame of a candle drop toward the floor when you\r\nreverse it, or hold it downward, instead of turning up and ascending\r\ninto the air?... Again, you look into a clear well of water, and see\r\nyour own face and figure, as if painted there. Why is this? You are\r\ntold that it is done by reflection of light. But what is reflection of\r\nlight?\"\r\n\r\nHenry took up this book and began to read. Soon it seemed more\r\ninteresting than Brooke's \"Fool of Quality\" and all the romances. At the\r\nvery next meeting of the theatrical society, he resigned the presidency,\r\ntelling his companions that he should devote his life to solid studies.\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle, seeing that the youth was interested in the book, gave it\r\nto him. It was ever after preserved in Professor Henry's library, with\r\nthese words written on the fly-leaf: \"This book, although by no means a\r\nprofound work, has, under Providence, exerted a remarkable influence\r\nupon my life. It accidentally fell into my hands when I was about\r\nsixteen years old, and was the first work I ever read with attention. It\r\nopened to me a new world of thought and enjoyment; invested things\r\nbefore almost unnoticed with the highest interest; fixed my mind on the\r\nstudy of nature, and caused me to resolve, at the time of reading it,\r\nthat I would immediately commence to devote my life to the acquisition\r\nof knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution was at once put in practice, by attending a\r\nnight-school, where he soon learned all that the master could teach. His\r\nnext attempt at education was to learn grammar of a travelling teacher,\r\nand so skilled did he become that he made a grammatical tour of the\r\ncountry districts, in imitation of his instructor, earning enough money\r\nto enter the Albany Academy. When more money was needed, the\r\nenterprising youth found a situation as head of a district school, at\r\neight dollars a month! He pleased his patrons so well that he received\r\nfifteen dollars for the second month. Later, he became an assistant in\r\nthe academy, while still a pupil.\r\n\r\nSays Orlando Meads, LL.D.: \"When a boy in the Albany Academy in 1823 and\r\n1824, it was my pleasure and privilege, when released from recitations,\r\nto resort to the chemical laboratory and lecture room. There might be\r\nfound from day to day through the winter, earnestly engaged in\r\nexperiments upon steam and upon a small steam-engine, and in chemical\r\nand other scientific investigations, two young men--both active members\r\nof the 'Lyceum,' then very different in their external circumstances and\r\nprospects in life, but of kindred tastes and sympathies; the one was\r\nRichard Varick De Witt, the other was Joseph Henry, as yet unknown to\r\nfame, but already giving promise of those rare qualities of mind and\r\ncharacter which have since raised him to the very first rank among the\r\nexperimental philosophers of his time.\r\n\r\n\"Chemistry at that time was exciting great interest, and Dr. Beck's\r\ncourses of chemical lectures, conducted every winter in the lecture room\r\nof the academy, were attended not only by the students, but by all that\r\nwas most intelligent and fashionable in the city. Henry ... was then Dr.\r\nBeck's chemical assistant, and already an admirable experimentalist,\r\nand he availed himself to the utmost of the advantages thus afforded of\r\nprosecuting his investigations in chemistry, electricity, and\r\ngalvanism.\" Dr. T. Romeyn Beck, the principal, had become interested in\r\nthe studious young man, and, when he left the academy, recommended him\r\nto one of the trustees, General Stephen Van Rensselaer, as a private\r\ntutor to his sons. Young Henry's services were engaged, and, as his\r\nteaching required but about three hours each day, he devoted his leisure\r\nto higher mathematics, in conjunction with chemistry, physiology, and\r\nanatomy, as he had decided to become a physician. In his mathematical\r\nstudies he went so far as to read the _Mecanique Analytique_ of La\r\nGrange.\r\n\r\nHis delicate constitution seemed unable to bear the continued strain of\r\nstudy and teaching, and at twenty-six, through the friendship of an\r\ninfluential judge, Henry received the appointment of engineer in the\r\nsurvey of a road between the Hudson River and Lake Erie, a distance of\r\nabout three hundred miles. This gave him out-of-door life, which he\r\nneeded, and, though much of his work was done in winter, in deep snow,\r\nmaking his way through dense forests, he entirely regained his health,\r\nand gave such excellent satisfaction that he was asked to construct a\r\ncanal in Ohio, and assist in a mining enterprise in Mexico. Both of\r\nthese he refused, accepting the chair of Mathematics and Natural\r\nPhilosophy in the Albany Academy, at the urgent solicitation of his\r\nfriend, Dr. Beck.\r\n\r\nElected in the spring, and not entering upon his work till autumn, he\r\nspent the intervening months in geological exploration in New York\r\nState. Every hour was occupied. He had commenced solid study in earnest,\r\nas he had told the members of the \"Rostrum\" he should do.\r\n\r\nHaving entered upon his profession, he taught mathematics seven hours\r\ndaily. But he found time to make experiments in natural philosophy. The\r\nfirst paper which he brought before the Albany Institute was, \"On the\r\nChemical and Mechanical Effects of Steam: with Experiments designed to\r\nillustrate the Great Reduction of Temperature in Steam of High\r\nElasticity when suddenly expanded.\"\r\n\r\nHis next published scientific paper was, \"On the Production of Cold by\r\nthe Rarefaction of Air: accompanied by Experiments.\" \"One of these\r\nexperiments most strikingly illustrated the great reduction of\r\ntemperature which takes place on the sudden rarefaction of condensed\r\nair. Half a pint of water was poured into a strong copper vessel of a\r\nglobular form, and having a capacity of five gallons; a tube of\r\none-fourth of an inch caliber, with a number of holes near the lower\r\nend, and a stop-cock attached to the other extremity, was firmly screwed\r\ninto the neck of the vessel; the lower end of the tube dipped into the\r\nwater, but a number of holes were above the surface of the liquid, so\r\nthat a jet of air mingled with water might be thrown from the fountain.\r\n\r\n\"The apparatus was then charged with condensed air, by means of a\r\npowerful condensing pump, until the pressure was estimated at nine\r\natmospheres. During the condensation, the vessel became sensibly warm.\r\nAfter suffering the apparatus to cool down to the temperature of the\r\nroom, the stop-cock was opened: the air rushed out with great violence,\r\ncarrying with it a quantity of water, which was instantly converted into\r\nsnow. After a few seconds, the tube became filled with ice, which almost\r\nentirely stopped the current of air. The neck of the vessel was then\r\npartially unscrewed, so as to allow the condensed air to rush out around\r\nthe sides of the screw; in this state the temperature of the whole\r\ninterior atmosphere was so much reduced as to freeze the remaining water\r\nin the vessel.\"\r\n\r\nOther pamphlets followed this publication, but in 1831 a notable paper\r\nin the \"American Journal of Science and the Arts\" brought Henry's name\r\nto the front line of discoverers in electro-magnetism. Sturgeon made the\r\nfirst electro-magnet; Henry made the electro-magnet what it is.\r\n\r\nSays W. B. Taylor, in an address before the \"Philosophical Society of\r\nWashington:\" \"The electro-magnet figured and described by Sturgeon\r\nconsisted of a small bar or stout iron wire bent into a [Inverted\r\nU-Symbol] or horse-shoe form, having a copper wire wound loosely\r\naround it in eighteen turns, with the ends of the wire dipping into\r\nmercury-cups connected with the respective poles of a battery having\r\none hundred and thirty square inches of active surface.\"\r\n\r\nHenry improved upon this in 1828, but in March of 1829 he exhibited\r\nbefore the Institute a somewhat larger magnet. \"A round piece of iron\r\nabout one-quarter of an inch in diameter was bent into the usual form of\r\na horse-shoe, and, instead of loosely coiling around it a few feet of\r\nwire as is usually described, it was tightly wound with thirty-five feet\r\nof wire covered with silk, so as to form about four hundred turns; a\r\npair of small galvanic plates, which could be dipped into a tumbler of\r\ndiluted acid, was soldered to the ends of the wire, and the whole\r\nmounted on a stand. With these small plates, the horse-shoe became much\r\nmore powerfully magnetic than another of the same size and wound in the\r\nusual manner, by the application of a battery composed of twenty-eight\r\nplates of copper and zinc each eight inches square.\"\r\n\r\n\"To Henry, therefore,\" says Mr. Taylor, \"belongs the exclusive credit of\r\nhaving first constructed the magnetic 'spool' or 'bobbin,' that form of\r\ncoil since universally employed for every application of\r\nelectro-magnetism, of induction, or of magneto-electrics. This was his\r\nfirst great contribution to the science and to the art of galvanic\r\nmagnetization....\r\n\r\n\"But, in addition to this large gift to science, Henry has the\r\npreeminent claim to popular gratitude of having first practically\r\nworked out the differing functions of two entirely different kinds\r\nof electro-magnet; the one surrounded with numerous coils of no great\r\nlength, designated by him the 'quantity' magnet, the other surrounded\r\nwith a continuous coil of very great length, designated by him the\r\n'intensity' magnet.... Never should it be forgotten that he who first\r\nexalted the 'quantity' magnet of Sturgeon from a power of twenty pounds\r\nto a power of twenty hundred pounds was the absolute CREATOR of the\r\n'intensity' magnet; and that the principles involved in this creation\r\nconstitute the indispensable basis of every form of the electro-magnetic\r\ntelegraph since invented.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Silliman of Yale College said: \"Henry has the honor of having\r\nconstructed by far the most powerful magnets that have ever been known;\r\nand his last, weighing (armature and all) but 82-1/2 pounds, sustains\r\nover a ton;--which is eight times more powerful than any magnet hitherto\r\nknown in Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"In 1831,\" says Professor Henry, \"I arranged around one of the upper\r\nrooms of the Albany Academy a wire of more than a mile in length,\r\nthrough which I was enabled to make signals by sounding a bell. The\r\nmechanical arrangement for effecting this object was simply a steel bar,\r\npermanently magnetized, of about ten inches in length, supported on a\r\npivot, and placed with its north end between the two arms of a\r\nhorse-shoe magnet. When the latter was excited by the current, the end\r\nof the bar thus placed was attracted by one arm of the horse-shoe and\r\nrepelled by the other, and was thus caused to move in a horizontal plane\r\nand its further end to strike a bell suitably adjusted.\" This was the\r\nfirst \"sounding\" electro-magnetic telegraph. With this growing fame he\r\nwas not disposed to think too highly of himself. A friend, noticing a\r\nlook of sadness in the face of the young professor, said to\r\nhim,--\"Albany will one day be proud of her son;\" and so it proved.\r\n\r\nA year before this, in May, 1830, Professor Henry had married, at\r\nthirty-one, Harriet L. Alexander of Schenectady, N. Y., a cultivated and\r\nhelpful woman.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, Princeton College needed a professor of natural philosophy.\r\nHenry's friends heartily commended him for the position. Silliman\r\nsaid,--\"Henry has no superior among the scientific men of the country,\"\r\nand Professor Renwick of Columbia College, New York, said, \"He has no\r\nequal.\"\r\n\r\nAfter six years at the Albany Academy, Henry removed to Princeton, where\r\nfor fourteen years he added constantly to his fame and usefulness by\r\noriginal work. Of his discoveries in these fruitful years he gives the\r\nfollowing summary, at the request of a friend:--\r\n\r\n\"I arrived in Princeton in November, 1832, and, as soon as I became\r\nfully settled in the chair which I occupied, I recommenced my\r\ninvestigations, constructed a still more powerful electro-magnet than I\r\nhad made before,--one which would sustain over three thousand\r\npounds,--and with it illustrated to my class the manner in which a large\r\namount of power might, by means of a relay magnet, be called into\r\noperation at the distance of many miles.... The electro-magnetic\r\ntelegraph was first invented by me, in Albany, in 1830.... At the time\r\nof making my original experiments on electro-magnetism in Albany, I was\r\nurged by a friend to take out a patent, both for its application to\r\nmachinery and to the telegraph; but this I declined, on the ground that\r\nI did not then consider it compatible with the dignity of science to\r\nconfine the benefits which might be derived from it to the exclusive use\r\nof any individual. In this perhaps I was too fastidious.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Asa Gray well said, \"For the telegraph and for\r\nelectro-magnetic machines, what was now wanted was not discovery, but\r\ninvention; not the ascertainment of principles, but the devising of\r\nmethods.\" Morse is not to be less honored because somebody discovered\r\nthe principle, which he and others utilized for the race, any more than\r\nEdison, Bell, and others, because Faraday and Henry helped to make their\r\ngrand work possible.\r\n\r\n\"My next investigation, after being settled at Princeton,\" says\r\nProfessor Henry, \"was in relation to electro-dynamic induction. Mr.\r\nFaraday had discovered that when a current of galvanic electricity was\r\npassed through a wire from a battery, a current in an opposite direction\r\nwas induced in a wire arranged parallel to this conductor. I discovered\r\nthat an induction of a similar kind took place in the primary conducting\r\nwire itself, so that a current which, in its passage through a short\r\nwire conductor, would neither produce sparks nor shocks would, if the\r\nwire were sufficiently long, produce both those phenomena....\r\n\r\n\"A series of investigations was afterwards made, resulting in producing\r\ninductive currents of different orders, having different directions,\r\nmade up of waves alternately in opposite directions....\r\n\r\n\"Another series of investigations, of a parallel character, was made in\r\nregard to ordinary or frictional electricity. In the course of these it\r\nwas shown that electro-dynamic inductive action of ordinary electricity\r\nwas of a peculiar character, and that effects could be produced by it at\r\na remarkable distance. For example, if a shock were sent through a wire\r\non the outside of a building, electrical effects could be exhibited in a\r\nparallel wire within the building.\"...\r\n\r\nAfter this, investigations were made in atmospheric induction; induction\r\nfrom thunder clouds; in regard to lightning rods; on substances capable\r\nof exhibiting phosphorescence, such as the diamond, which, when exposed\r\nto the direct rays of the sun, and then removed to a dark place, emits a\r\npale blue light; on a method of determining the velocity of projectiles;\r\non the heat of the spots on the sun as compared with the rest of his\r\ndisk; the detection of heat by the thermal telescope--\"when the object\r\nwas a horse in a distant field, the radiant heat from the animal was\r\ndistinctly perceptible at a distance of at least several hundred yards;\"\r\non the cohesion of liquids; on the tenacity of soapwater in films; on\r\nthe origin of mechanical power, and the nature of vital force.\r\n\r\nHenry says:--\r\n\r\n\"The mechanical power exerted by animals is due to the passage of\r\norganized matter in the stomach, from an unstable to a stable\r\nequilibrium; or, as it were, from the combustion of the food. It\r\ntherefore follows that animal power is referable to the same source as\r\nthat from the combustion of fuel--namely, developed power of the sun's\r\nbeams. But, according to this view, what is vitality? It is that\r\nmysterious principle--not mechanical power--which determines the form\r\nand arranges the atoms of organized matter, employing for this purpose\r\nthe power which is derived from the food....\r\n\r\n\"Suppose a vegetable organism impregnated with a germ (a potato, for\r\ninstance) is planted below the surface of the ground, in damp soil,\r\nunder a temperature sufficient for vegetation. If we examine it from\r\ntime to time, we find it sending down rootlets into the earth, and stems\r\nand leaves upward into the air. After the leaves have been fully\r\nexpanded we shall find the tuber entirely exhausted, nothing but a skin\r\nremaining. The same effect will take place if the potato be placed in a\r\nwarm cellar; it will continue to grow until all the starch and gluten\r\nare exhausted, when it will cease to increase. If, however, we now place\r\nit in the light, it will commence to grow again, and increase in size\r\nand weight. If we weigh the potato previous to the experiment, and the\r\nplant after it has ceased to grow in the dark, we shall find that the\r\nweight of the latter is a little more than half of the original tuber.\r\nThe question then is, what has become of the material which filled the\r\nsac of the potato? The answer is, one part has run down into carbonic\r\nacid and water, and in this running down has evolved the power to build\r\nup the other part into the new plant. After the leaves have been formed\r\nand the plant exposed to the light of the sun, the developed power of\r\nits rays decomposes the carbonic acid of the atmosphere, and thus\r\nfurnishes the pabulum and the power necessary to the further development\r\nof the organization.\r\n\r\n\"The same is the case with wheat, and all other grains that are\r\ngerminated in the earth. Besides the germ of the future plant, there is\r\nstored away, around the germ, the starch and gluten to furnish the power\r\nnecessary to its development, and also the food to build it up, until it\r\nreaches the surface of the earth and can draw the sources of its future\r\ngrowth from the power of the sunbeam. In the case of fungi and other\r\nplants that grow in the dark, they derive the power and the pabulum from\r\nsurrounding vegetable matter in process of decay, or in that of evolving\r\npower.\"...\r\n\r\n\"What then is the office of vitality? We say that it is analogous to\r\nthat of the engineer who directs the power of the steam-engine in the\r\nexecution of its work.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he had published in 1844, with some fulness, as he then wrought\r\nthem out,\" says Professor Gray, \"his conception and his attractive\r\nillustrations of the sources, transformation, and equivalence of\r\nmechanical power, and given them fitting publicity, Henry's name would\r\nhave been prominent among the pioneers and founders of the modern\r\ndoctrine of the conservation of energy.\"\r\n\r\nHenry always defined science as the \"knowledge of natural law,\" and law\r\nas the \"will of God.\" He found all things, even the storms, under the\r\n\"control of laws--fixed, immutable, and eternal,\" and rejoiced in\r\nbelieving that \"a Supreme Intelligence who knows no change\" governs all.\r\nFor him there was never any conflict between science and religion.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1837, Henry went to Europe, accompanied by Prof. Alexander\r\nD. Bache, at the head of the United States Coast Survey for eighteen\r\nyears. He became the friend of Faraday; of Wheatstone, then Professor of\r\nExperimental Philosophy in King's College, who was engaged in developing\r\nhis system of the needle telegraph; of Arago, Gay-Lussac, and other\r\nnoted men. \"At King's College,\" says Prof. Alfred M. Mayer, \"Faraday,\r\nWheatstone, Daniell, and Henry had met to try and evolve the electric\r\nspark from the thermopile. Each in turn attempted it and failed. Then\r\ncame Henry's turn. He succeeded, calling in the aid of his discovery of\r\nthe effect of a long interpolar wire wrapped around a piece of soft\r\niron. Faraday became as wild as a boy, and, jumping up, shouted:\r\n'Hurrah for the Yankee experiment!'\" \"It is not generally known or\r\nappreciated,\" says Professor Mayer, \"that Henry and Faraday\r\nindependently discovered the means of producing the electric current and\r\nthe electric spark from a magnet.... Henry cannot be placed on record as\r\nthe _first_ discoverer of the magneto-electric current, but it _can_ be\r\nclaimed that he stands alone as its _second_ independent discoverer.\"\r\nBoth James D. Forbes of Edinburgh and Henry obtained the spark, but were\r\nanticipated by Faraday.\r\n\r\nHenry spoke before the various scientific societies. He was no longer\r\nthe apprentice to a watch-maker, or the leader of private theatricals,\r\nbut a distinguished scholar. By his own will and energy he had attained\r\nto this enviable position.\r\n\r\nMeantime a man of science, in England, had thought out a great project\r\nfor the benefit of his fellow-men. James Smithson, a wealthy English\r\nchemist, a Fellow of the Royal Society, unmarried, died in 1829. He left\r\nhis property, over five hundred and forty thousand dollars, after the\r\ndeath of his nephew, provided that he died childless, \"to the United\r\nStates of America, to found at Washington, under the name of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion\r\nof knowledge among men.\" The nephew died six years later, unmarried.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed a wonderful gift,--and from a stranger! Difficulties at\r\nonce presented themselves. How could the property be used \"for the\r\nincrease and diffusion of knowledge among men\"? \"For ten years,\" says\r\nGarfield, \"Congress wrestled with those nine words of Smithson, and\r\ncould not handle them. Some political philosophers of that period held\r\nthat we had no constitutional authority to accept the gift at all, and\r\nproposed to send it back to England. Every conceivable proposition was\r\nmade.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams desired a great astronomical observatory. One person\r\nwished an agricultural school; another, a college for women; another,\r\nthat the funds should be devoted to meteorological observations all over\r\nthe Union. Finally, a board of regents was appointed, with power to\r\nchoose a suitable person as secretary.\r\n\r\nHe must be a learned man, a wise financier, with good judgment and\r\npleasant manners. Professor Henry fulfilled all the conditions. He was\r\nadmired for his learning; in finance he was wise, as thirty years have\r\nproved, the institute with its endowment now being valued at one and a\r\nhalf million dollars; his kindly manner made him accessible, willing to\r\nlisten to any one who hoped or believed he had discovered something in\r\nthe line of knowledge. A man who can be harsh or cold to an ignorant\r\nperson, or indeed to anybody, does not deserve to hold any public\r\nposition. With natural quickness of temper in early life, he had gained\r\nremarkable self-control. Like Baron Cuvier, he had no tolerance for\r\nsarcasm or \"practical jokes.\" Henry was unanimously chosen, entering\r\nupon his duties December 3, 1846. He had a definite plan of the work\r\nwhich ought to be done, and \"after due deliberation it received the\r\nalmost unanimous approval of the scientific world.\"\r\n\r\nHe believed that the money should be used in original scientific work;\r\nby helping men to publish the results of such work; to aid in varied\r\nexplorations; to send scientific publications all over the world. The\r\ninstitution is now the principal agent of scientific and literary\r\ncommunication between the old world and the new. The number of foreign\r\ninstitutions and correspondents receiving the Smithsonian publications\r\nexceeds two thousand, scattered from New Zealand and India to Yokohama,\r\nin Japan, and Cape Town, in Southern Africa. The weight of matter sent\r\nabroad for ten years, ending 1877, was ninety-nine thousand pounds.\r\nAmong the first subjects taken up by the institution for investigation\r\nwas that of American archaeology, an attempt to ascertain the industrial,\r\nsocial, and intellectual character of the earliest races on our\r\ncontinent. The first publication of \"Smithsonian Contributions\" was a\r\nwork on the mounds and earthworks found in the Mississippi valley, a\r\nmost fascinating study.\r\n\r\nThe Smithsonian, \"first in the world, organized a comprehensive system\r\nof telegraphic meteorology, and has thus given first to Europe and Asia,\r\nand now to the United States, that most beneficent national application\r\nof modern science--the storm warnings.\"\r\n\r\nSo much of value has been gathered by government surveys and by\r\nvoluntary contribution that the institution has sent duplicates to\r\nvarious societies of specimens in geology, mineralogy, botany, zooelogy,\r\nand archaeology, while it has remaining, \"boxed up, varieties of art and\r\nnature\" more than enough to twice fill the halls and galleries of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nThe work of Professor Henry grew more and more onerous, but he seemed to\r\nleave nothing undone. For many years he served gratuitously as chairman\r\nof the Lighthouse Board. When a substitute was needed for sperm oil,\r\nafter almost numberless experiments, he showed that lard oil is the best\r\nilluminant, thereby saving the country over one hundred thousand dollars\r\nyearly, since 1865.\r\n\r\nDuring the last twelve years of his life, he devoted much time to our\r\nsystem of coast fog-signals, making \"contributions to the science of\r\nacoustics, unquestionably the most important of the century.\"\r\n\r\nObservations were made, among other places, at Block Island and Point\r\nJudith. The distance between these fog-horns is seventeen miles, and the\r\nsound of one can be distinctly heard at the other when the air is quiet\r\nand homogeneous; but if the wind blows from one towards the other, the\r\nlistener at the station from which the wind blows is unable to hear the\r\nother horn.\r\n\r\nWhile at work in the Lighthouse Depot, in Staten Island, December, 1877,\r\nHenry's right hand became in a paralytic condition. This foretold that\r\nthe end was near. He died at noon, May 13, 1878, asking, with his latest\r\nbreath, which way the wind came, as though still thinking how to save\r\nhuman lives in a fog at sea. He was buried May 16, at Rock Creek\r\nCemetery, near Georgetown, D. C. He was ready when death came. Two weeks\r\nbefore, he said to a friend: \"I may die at any moment. I would like to\r\nlive long enough to complete some things I have undertaken, but I am\r\ncontent to go. I have had a happy life, and I hope I have been able to\r\ndo some good.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral times during his connection with the Smithsonian Institution he\r\nwas offered more lucrative positions, but he remained where he believed\r\nhe could be most useful. He was called to the professorship of chemistry\r\nin the Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania, with double\r\nthe salary of his secretaryship; but he declined. He was urged also to\r\ntake the presidency of the college at Princeton. John C. Calhoun desired\r\nhim to accept a professorship in the University of Virginia, as there\r\nwere so many difficulties in connection with the secretaryship. Henry\r\ndeclined, saying that \"his honor was committed to the institution.\"\r\nCalhoun grasped his hand, exclaiming, \"Professor Henry, you are a man\r\nafter my own heart.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have no time to accumulate money. Fortunately, a fund of\r\nforty thousand dollars has been raised by friends, the income of which\r\ngoes to his family during life, and afterwards to the National Academy\r\nof Sciences, to be devoted to original research.\r\n\r\nIn character he was above reproach. He said, \"I think that immorality\r\nand great mental power exercised in the discovery of scientific truths\r\nare incompatible with each other; and that more error is introduced from\r\ndefect in moral sense than from want of intellectual capacity.\"\r\n\r\nHe loved nature. \"A life devoted exclusively to the study of a single\r\ninsect,\" he said, \"is not spent in vain. No animal, however\r\ninsignificant, is isolated; it forms a part of the great system of\r\nnature, and is governed by the same general laws which control the most\r\nprominent beings of the organic world.\" In 1870, when gazing upon the\r\nAar glacier, from the Rhone valley, he exclaimed to his daughter, while\r\nthe tears coursed down his cheeks: \"This is a place to die in. We should\r\ngo no further.\" A really great man is never afraid to show that he has a\r\ntender heart.\r\n\r\nHe loved his home. Out from it, in his early married life, two children\r\nwent by death, and later, an only son in his early manhood. Three\r\ndaughters were left him. One of them records in her diary: \"Had father\r\nwith us all the evening. I modelled his profile in clay, while he read\r\n'Thomson's Seasons' to us. In the earlier part of the evening he seemed\r\nrestless and depressed, but the influence of the poet drove away the\r\ncloud, and then an expression of almost childlike sweetness rested upon\r\nhis lips, singularly in contrast, yet beautifully in harmony, with, the\r\nintellect of the brow above.\"\r\n\r\nAgain she writes: \"We were all up until a late hour, reading poetry with\r\nfather and mother, father being the reader. He attempted 'Cowper's\r\nGrave,' by Mrs. Browning, but was too tender-hearted to finish the\r\nreading of it. We then laughed over the 'Address to the Mummy,' soared\r\nto heaven with Shelley's 'Skylark,' roamed the forest with Bryant,\r\nculled flowers from other poetical fields, and ended with 'Tam\r\nO'Shanter.' I took for my task to recite a part of the latter from\r\nmemory, while father corrected, as if he were 'playing schoolmaster.'\"\r\n\r\nHe was orderly and painstaking in his work, deciding with great caution.\r\nProf. Asa Gray tells a story of his boyhood which well illustrates this.\r\n\"It goes back to the time when he was first allowed to have a pair of\r\nboots, and to choose for himself the style of them. He was living with\r\nhis grandmother, in the country, and the village Crispin could offer no\r\ngreat choice of patterns; indeed, it was narrowed down to the\r\nalternative of round toes or square. Daily the boy visited the shop and\r\npondered the alternatives, even while the manufacture was going on,\r\nuntil, at length, the shoemaker, who could brook no more delay, took the\r\ndilemma by both horns, and produced the most remarkable pair of boots\r\nthe wearer ever had; one boot round-toed, the other square-toed.... He\r\nprobably never again postponed decision till it was too late to choose.\"\r\n\r\nA single incident illustrates the kindness of the man, who was always\r\ncalled the \"model of a Christian gentleman.\" \"Early in the war, in the\r\nautumn of 1861, a caller at the presidential mansion, very anxious to\r\nsee the chief magistrate of the nation, was informed that he could not\r\nthen be seen, being engaged in an important private consultation. The\r\ncaller, not to be repulsed, wrote on a piece of paper that he must see\r\nMr. Lincoln personally, on a matter of vital and pressing importance to\r\nthe public welfare. This, of course, secured his admission to the\r\npresence of Mr. Lincoln, who was sitting with a middle-aged gentleman.\r\nObserving the hesitancy of the visitor, the President told him he might\r\nspeak freely, as only a friend was present.\r\n\r\n\"Whereupon the visitor announced that for several evenings past he had\r\nobserved a light exhibited on the highest of the Smithsonian towers, for\r\na few minutes, about nine o'clock, with mysterious movements, which, he\r\nfelt satisfied, were designed as signals to the rebels encamped on\r\nMunson's Hill, in Virginia. Having gravely listened to this information\r\nwith raised eyebrows, but a subdued twinkle of the eye, the President\r\nturned to his companion, saying, 'What do you think of that, Professor\r\nHenry?'\r\n\r\n\"Rising with a smile, the person addressed replied that, from the time\r\nmentioned, he presumed the mysterious light shone from the lantern of\r\nan attendant who was required at nine o'clock each evening to observe\r\nand record the indications of the meteorological instruments placed on\r\nthe tower. The painful confusion of the officious informant at once\r\nappealed to Henry's sensibility, and, quite unmindful of the President,\r\nhe approached the visitor, offering his hand, and with a courteous\r\nregard counselled him never to be abashed at the issue of a\r\nconscientious discharge of duty, and never to let the fear of ridicule\r\ninterfere with its faithful execution.\"\r\n\r\nHenry had learned how to triumph over the misfortunes of life. In 1865,\r\nthe Smithsonian building was partially burned, with nearly one hundred\r\nthousand letters, his notes of original research for thirty years, the\r\nannual report in manuscript, ready for the press, a valuable library,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"A few years ago,\" he said, \"such a calamity would have paralyzed me for\r\nfuture efforts, but in my present view of life I take it as the\r\ndispensation of a kind and wise Providence, and trust that it will work\r\nto my spiritual advantage.\"\r\n\r\nA bronze statue of Joseph Henry, by W. W. Story, costing fifteen\r\nthousand dollars, was unveiled in the grounds of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, April 19, 1883. Ten thousand people were assembled to\r\nwitness the ceremonies. Noah Porter, ex-president of Yale College,\r\ndelivered the oration. There it will tell the story of a self-made\r\nman--of whom Garfield said: \"Remembering his great career as a man of\r\nscience, as a man who served his government with singular ability and\r\nfaithfulness, who was loved and venerated by every circle, who blessed\r\nwith the light of his friendship the worthiest and the best, whose life\r\nadded new lustre to the glory of the human race, we shall be most\r\nfortunate if ever in the future we see his like again.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Joseph Henry was succeeded by Prof. Spencer F. Baird as secretary\r\nof the Smithsonian Institution. He died August 19, 1887, and Prof. S. P.\r\nLangley was called to the position, accepting the office November 18,\r\n1887. The mantle of Henry has fallen upon a worthy successor; a scholar\r\nwho has given us, among other works, the \"New Astronomy,\" whose beauty\r\nof diction, breadth of knowledge, and exquisite illustrations are so\r\nwell remembered, as it appeared first in the pages of the Century\r\nMagazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS AGASSIZ.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of as beautiful scenery as one finds on earth, snow-white\r\nAlps, blue lakes, great fields of purple crocus, and picturesque homes,\r\nJean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz was born at Motier, on Lake Morat,\r\nSwitzerland, May 28, 1807.\r\n\r\nHis father, a clergyman, descended from a long line of clergymen, was a\r\ngentle but efficient man, universally esteemed. His mother, Rose Mayor,\r\nthe daughter of a physician on the shore of Lake Neuchatel, was a woman\r\nof strong character and most tender affection. She had buried her first\r\nfour children; therefore Louis was cared for with unusual solicitude.\r\n\r\nUntil he was ten years old, he was taught by his parents, and allowed to\r\ndevelop his natural tastes. Possibly his sweetness of disposition\r\nresulted, in part, from the wise training of the father and mother.\r\nDoubtless as many children are spoiled by undue thwarting and irritating\r\nas by over-indulgence. Though Louis met almost unsurmountable obstacles\r\nlater in life, he was able to rejoice, having enjoyed a sunny childhood.\r\nSuch a childhood we can give to our children but once.\r\n\r\nIn a great stone basin back of the parsonage, the boy made his first\r\naquarium. There he gathered fishes, frogs, tadpoles, indeed, everything\r\nwhich he could obtain from Lake Morat. In the house he had pet birds,\r\nhares, rabbits, field-mice, with their families, all cared for as though\r\nthey were royal visitors.\r\n\r\nHe was skilful as a carpenter and boot-maker. When the village cobbler\r\ncame to the house, two or three times a year, to make shoes for the\r\nfamily, the lad was quick to imitate him, and made well fitting shoes\r\nfor his sister's dolls.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, in her fascinating life of her husband,\r\ntells this incident of his boyhood: \"Though fond of quiet, indoor\r\noccupation, he was an active, daring boy. One winter day, when about\r\nseven years of age, he was skating with his little brother Auguste, two\r\nyears younger than himself, and a number of other boys, near the shore\r\nof the lake. They were talking of a great fair held that day at the town\r\nof Morat, on the opposite side of the lake, to which M. Agassiz had gone\r\nin the morning, not crossing upon the ice, however, but driving around\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\n\"The temptation was too strong for Louis, and he proposed to Auguste\r\nthat they should skate across, join their father at the fair, and come\r\nhome with him in the afternoon. They started accordingly. The other boys\r\nremained on their skating ground till twelve o'clock, the usual dinner\r\nhour, when they returned to the village. Mme. Agassiz was watching for\r\nher boys, thinking them rather late, and, on inquiring for them among\r\nthe troop of urchins coming down the village street, she learned on\r\nwhat errand they had gone. Her anxiety may be imagined. The lake was not\r\nless than two miles across, and she was by no means sure that the ice\r\nwas safe.\r\n\r\n\"She hurried to an upper window with a spy-glass, to see if she could\r\ndescry them anywhere. At the moment she caught sight of them, already\r\nfar on their journey, Louis had laid himself down across a fissure in\r\nthe ice, thus making a bridge for his little brother, who was creeping\r\nover his back. Their mother directed a workman, an excellent skater, to\r\nfollow them as swiftly as possible. He overtook them just as they had\r\ngained the shore, but it did not occur to him that they could return\r\notherwise than they had come, and he skated back with them across the\r\nlake. Weary, hungry, and disappointed, the boys reached the house\r\nwithout having seen the fair or enjoyed the drive home with their father\r\nin the afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nAt ten, Louis was sent to a school for boys at Bienne, where, though the\r\nchildren studied nine hours a day, the time was wisely divided between\r\nwork and play, so that they were kept well and happy. The lad always\r\nremembered affectionately his teacher at this school, Mr. Rickly. When\r\nthe vacations came, Louis and Auguste walked twenty miles home to\r\nMotier, and did not find the journey long or tedious.\r\n\r\nAt fourteen, Louis left Bienne, having finished his education, as he\r\nsupposed, prior to entering the business house of his uncle, Francois\r\nMayor, at Neuchatel. That his young mind turned longingly towards a\r\ndifferent future, may be seen from his desires written at this time on a\r\nsheet of foolscap.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to advance in the sciences, and for that I need D'Anville,\r\nRitter, an Italian dictionary, a Strabo in Greek, Mannert and Thiersch;\r\nand also the works of Malte-Brun and Seyfert. I have resolved, as far as\r\nI am allowed to do so, to become a man of letters, and at present I can\r\ngo no further: first, in ancient geography, for I already know all my\r\nnote-books, and I have only such books as Mr. Rickly can lend me; I must\r\nhave D'Anville or Mannert; second, in modern geography also, I have only\r\nsuch books as Mr. Rickly can lend me, and the Osterwold geography, which\r\ndoes not accord with the new divisions; I must have Ritter or\r\nMalte-Brun; third, for Greek I need a new grammar, and I shall choose\r\nThiersch; fourth, I have no Italian dictionary, except one lent me by\r\nMr. Moltz; I must have one; fifth, for Latin I need a larger grammar\r\nthan the one I have, and I should like Seyfert; sixth, Mr. Rickly tells\r\nme that, as I have a taste for geography, he will give me a lesson in\r\nGreek (_gratis_) in which we would translate Strabo, provided I can find\r\none. For all this I ought to have about twelve louis. I should like to\r\nstay at Bienne till the month of July, and afterward serve my\r\napprenticeship in commerce at Neuchatel for a year and a half. Then I\r\nshould like to pass four years at a university in Germany, and finally\r\nfinish my studies at Paris, where I would stay about five years. Then,\r\nat the age of twenty-five, I could begin to write.\"\r\n\r\nAt this early age, then, he was thinking of being an author!\r\n\r\nHe begged his parents to defer the business project for two years, that\r\nhe might study at the College of Lausanne. They were willing and glad to\r\nplease their boy; but they knew from experience the ills of poverty, and\r\nthey hoped to save him from it by a wise choice of a life-work.\r\n\r\nThey gratified him, however, and he went to Lausanne. His uncle, Dr.\r\nMathias Mayor, a physician of Lausanne, seeing that the boy was deeply\r\ninterested in anatomy, advised that he should study medicine; so this\r\nwas decided upon, as being more in accord with Louis' tastes than\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nAs poor Vincenzio Galileo found it a difficult matter to make a wool\r\nmerchant or a doctor out of a boy destined to be a man of science, so\r\ndid the father of Louis Agassiz.\r\n\r\nAt seventeen, Louis left Lausanne for the medical school at Zurich. Here\r\nhe became the friend as well as pupil of Professor Schinz, who held the\r\nchair of Natural History and Physiology. He gave young Agassiz a key to\r\nhis private library, and also to his collection of birds; of course, the\r\nlove for natural history grew stronger. Both boys, for Auguste had come\r\nto Zurich with his brother, were too poor to buy books even when they\r\ncost but a dollar a volume. The Swiss minister was saving to the\r\nuttermost to pay for board and decent clothes for his sons, to say\r\nnothing of books. Therefore the use of Schinz's library was a great\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nSaid Agassiz in after years, \"My inability to buy books was, perhaps,\r\nnot so great a misfortune as it seemed to me; at least, it saved me from\r\ntoo great dependence on written authority. I spent all my time in\r\ndissecting animals and in studying human anatomy, not forgetting my\r\nfavorite amusements of fishing and collecting. I was always surrounded\r\nwith pets, and had at this time some forty birds flying about my study,\r\nwith no other home than a large pine-tree in the corner. I still\r\nremember my grief when a visitor, entering suddenly, caught one of my\r\nlittle favorites between the floor and the door, and he was killed\r\nbefore I could extricate him. Professor Schinz's private collection of\r\nbirds was my daily resort, and I then described every bird it contained,\r\nas I could not afford to buy even a text-book of ornithology.\r\n\r\n\"I also copied with my own hand, having no means of purchasing the work,\r\ntwo volumes of Lamarck's 'Animaux sans Vertebres,' and my dear brother\r\ncopied another half-volume for me. I finally learned that the study of\r\nthe things themselves was far more attractive than the books I so much\r\ncoveted, and when, at last, large libraries became accessible to me, I\r\nusually contented myself with turning over the leaves of the volumes on\r\nnatural history, looking at the illustrations, and recording the titles\r\nof the works, that I might readily consult them for identification of\r\nsuch objects as I should have an opportunity of examining in nature.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys remained two years at Zurich. One vacation, as they were\r\nwalking home, the family having moved from Motier to Orbe, they were\r\novertaken by a gentleman who asked them to ride, shared his lunch with\r\nthem, and took them to their own door. Some days afterward he wrote to\r\nM. Agassiz that he had been so impressed by his son Louis that he wished\r\nto adopt him and provide for him through life.\r\n\r\nThis request caused great commotion in the little home, for the writer\r\nof the letter was a man of wealth in Geneva, but, after careful\r\nconsideration, both parents and son declined the offer, preferring to\r\nstruggle with poverty rather than bear separation.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the two years in Zurich, Auguste went to the commercial\r\nhouse of his uncle at Neuchatel, and Louis to the University of\r\nHeidelberg, taking letters of introduction from Professor Schinz and\r\nothers. Professor Tiedemann, the chancellor, had studied with Schinz;\r\ntherefore, Agassiz received a warm welcome, and an offer of books from\r\nhis library.\r\n\r\nThe young student worked earnestly. He wrote to his father: \"Every\r\nmorning I rise at six o'clock, dress and breakfast. At seven I go to my\r\nlectures given during the morning.... If, in the interval, I have a\r\nfree hour, as sometimes happens from ten to eleven, I occupy it in\r\nmaking anatomical preparations.... From twelve to one I practise\r\nfencing. We dine at about one o'clock, after which I walk till two, when\r\nI return to the house and to my studies till five o'clock. From five to\r\nsix we have a lecture from the renowned Tiedemann. After that, I either\r\ntake a bath in the Neckar, or another walk. From eight to nine I resume\r\nmy special work, and then, according to my inclination, go to the Swiss\r\nClub, or, if I am tired, to bed. I have my evening service and talk\r\nsilently with you, believing that at that hour you also do not forget\r\nyour Louis, who thinks always of you.\"\r\n\r\nAt Heidelberg, like Humboldt, Agassiz needed a congenial friend, and\r\nfound one in Alexander Braun, of Carlsruhe, an ardent lover of botany,\r\nafterward Director of the Botanical Gardens in Berlin. He wrote to his\r\nparents concerning Agassiz, \"a rare comet on the Heidelberg horizon....\r\nNot only do we collect and learn to observe all manner of things, but we\r\nhave also an opportunity of exchanging our views on scientific matters\r\nin general. I learn a great deal from him, for he is much more at home\r\nin zooelogy than I am. He is familiar with almost all the known mammalia,\r\nrecognizes the birds from far off by their song, and can give a name to\r\nevery fish in the water.\r\n\r\n\"In the morning we often stroll together through the fish market, where\r\nhe explains to me all the different species. He is going to teach me how\r\nto stuff fishes, and then we intend to make a collection of all the\r\nnative kinds. Many other useful things he knows; speaks German and\r\nFrench equally well, English and Italian fairly, so that I have already\r\nappointed him to be my interpreter on some future vacation trip to\r\nItaly. He is well acquainted with ancient languages also, and studies\r\nmedicine besides.\"\r\n\r\nSchimper, another brilliant botanist, was a friend of both Braun and\r\nAgassiz. The professor in zooelogy, Leuckart, was very fond of these\r\nbright pupils, and allowed himself to be gotten up at seven in the\r\nmorning, to give them extra lectures.\r\n\r\nWhen vacation came, Braun took Agassiz to his home; a cultured place,\r\nrich in books, music, and collections of plants and animals. Agassiz was\r\nvery happy there; possibly the happiness was increased by the fact that\r\nBraun had a lovely and artistic sister, Cecile. Agassiz wrote home, \"My\r\nhappiness would be perfect were it not for the painful thought which\r\npursues me everywhere, that I live on your privations; yet it is\r\nimpossible for me to diminish my expenses further. You would lift a\r\ngreat weight from my heart if you could relieve yourself of this burden\r\nby an arrangement with my uncle at Neuchatel.... Otherwise I am well,\r\ngoing on as usual, always working as hard as I can, and I believe all\r\nthe professors whose lectures I attend are satisfied with me.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1827, when Agassiz was twenty, he was taken ill of\r\ntyphus fever, and it was feared he would not recover. As soon as\r\npossible he was removed to Braun's home, and most tenderly cared for.\r\nWhen he became able, he went to his own home, at Orbe. From there he\r\nwrites to Braun: \"I had the good fortune to find at least thirty\r\nspecimens of Bombinator obstetricans, with the eggs. Tell Dr. Leuckart\r\nthat I will bring him some,--and some for you also. I kept several\r\nalive, laid in damp moss; after fourteen days the eggs were almost as\r\nlarge as peas, and the little tadpoles moved about inside in all\r\ndirections. The mother stripped the eggs from her legs, and one of the\r\nlittle tadpoles came out, but died for want of water. Then I placed the\r\nwhole mass of eggs in a vessel filled with water, and behold! in about\r\nan hour some twenty young ones were swimming freely about. I shall spare\r\nno pains to raise them, and I hope, if I begin aright, to make fine\r\ntoads of them in the end. My oldest sister is busy every day in making\r\ndrawings for me to illustrate their gradual development.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1827, Agassiz and Braun, after spending a little more\r\nthan a year at Heidelberg, went to the University of Munich, there\r\nmeeting Schimper. He wrote home, that from one of his windows he could\r\nsee \"the whole chain of the Tyrolean Alps, as far as Appenzell.... It is\r\na great pleasure to have at least a part of our Swiss mountains always\r\nin sight. To enjoy it the more, I have placed my table opposite the\r\nwindow, so that every time I lift my head my eyes rest on our dear\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nAt Munich, the young students were stimulated by the presence of many\r\nnoted men. Doellinger lectured on comparative anatomy; Schelling, on\r\nphilosophy; Oken, on natural history, physiology, and zooelogy; Martius,\r\non botany. Agassiz and Braun roomed in Doellinger's house. This room soon\r\nbecame the intellectual centre for the bright men of the college, and\r\nwas called \"the little academy.\" Here different students gave lectures,\r\neach on his special subject of study; the professors, even, coming as\r\nlisteners.\r\n\r\n\"In that room,\" said Agassiz, years later, \"I made all the skeletons\r\nrepresented on the plates of Wagler's 'Natural System of Reptiles';\r\nthere I once received the great anatomist Meckel, sent to me by\r\nDoellinger to examine my anatomical preparations, and especially the many\r\nfish-skeletons I had made from fresh-water fishes. By my side were\r\nconstantly at work two artists; one engaged in drawing various objects\r\nof natural history, the other in drawing fossil fishes. I kept always\r\none, and sometimes two artists, in my pay. It was not easy, with an\r\nallowance of two hundred and fifty dollars a year; but they were even\r\npoorer than I, and so we managed to get along together. My microscope I\r\nhad earned by writing.\" Poor Agassiz! he was yet to see greater\r\npecuniary trials than this.\r\n\r\nSays Mr. Dinkel, one of the artists who worked with Agassiz for many\r\nyears: \"I soon found myself engaged four or five hours almost daily in\r\npainting for him fresh-water fishes from the life, while he was at my\r\nside, sometimes writing out his descriptions, sometimes directing me....\r\nHe never lost his temper, though often under great trial; he remained\r\nself-possessed, and did everything calmly, having a friendly smile for\r\nevery one, and a helping hand for those who were in need. He was at that\r\ntime scarcely twenty years old, and was already the most prominent among\r\nthe students of Munich. They loved him, and had a high consideration for\r\nhim.... He liked merry society, but he himself was in general reserved,\r\nand never noisy. He picked out the gifted and highly learned students,\r\nand would not waste his time in ordinary conversation. Often, when he\r\nsaw a number of students going off on some empty pleasure-trip, he said\r\nto me, 'There they go with the other fellows.... I will go my own way,\r\nMr. Dinkel,--and not alone. I will be a leader of others.'\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz writes to his brother Auguste: \"It will interest you to know\r\nthat I am working with a young Dr. Born upon an anatomy and natural\r\nhistory of the fresh-water fishes of Europe. We have already gathered a\r\ngreat deal of material, and I think by the spring, or in the course of\r\nthe summer, we shall be able to publish the first number.... I earnestly\r\nadvise you to while away your leisure hours with study. Read much, but\r\nonly good and useful books.... Remember that statistical and political\r\nknowledge alone distinguishes the true merchant from the mere tradesmen,\r\nand guides him in his undertakings.... Write me about what you are\r\nreading, and about your plans and projects, for I can hardly believe\r\nthat any one could exist without forming them; I, at least, could not.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that the watchful mother begins to be anxious, for she\r\nhears nothing from her son about her \"project\" of medicine. She writes\r\nhim that she detects in his letters \"a certain sadness and discontent.\"\r\n\"How is it,\" she says, \"that you look forward only with distaste to the\r\npractice of medicine? Have you reflected seriously before setting aside\r\nthis profession? Indeed, we cannot consent to such a step; you would\r\nlose ground in our opinion, in that of your family, and in that of the\r\npublic you would pass for an inconsiderate, fickle young fellow, and the\r\nslightest stain on your reputation would be a mortal blow to us.... Of\r\ncourse you will not gather roses without thorns. Life consists of pains\r\nand pleasures everywhere. To do all the good you can to your\r\nfellow-beings, to have a pure conscience, to gain an honorable\r\nlivelihood, to procure for yourself by work a little ease, to make those\r\naround you happy, that is true happiness; all the rest but mere\r\naccessories and chimeras.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the good Swiss minister adds, thus to quiet his son's restless\r\nnature, \"If it be absolutely essential to your happiness that you\r\nshould break the ice of the two poles in order to find the hairs of a\r\nmammoth, ... at least wait till your trunk is packed and your passports\r\nare signed before you talk with us about it. Begin by reaching your\r\nfirst aim, a physician's and surgeon's diploma.... My own philosophy is\r\nto fulfil my duties in my sphere, and even that gives me more than I can\r\ndo.\" Fortunately Louis Agassiz did not possess the kind of philosophy\r\nthat brings content in a small parish on a Swiss lake; his sphere was to\r\nbe the world, and two continents were to be proud of him.\r\n\r\nIn 1817, the King of Bavaria had sent two naturalists, M. Martius and M.\r\nSpix, on an exploring expedition to Brazil. They returned in four years,\r\nladen with treasures. M. Martius issued colored illustrations of all the\r\nunknown plants he had collected, and M. Spix several volumes on the\r\nmonkeys, birds, and reptiles of Brazil. He had intended to give a\r\ncomplete natural history of Brazil, but died before his work was\r\nfinished. Martius asked Agassiz to continue the work of Spix, in the\r\nline of fishes.\r\n\r\nAgassiz writes to his sister Cecile: \"I hesitated for a long time to\r\naccept this honorable offer, fearing that the occupation might withdraw\r\nme too much from my studies; but, on the other hand, the opportunity for\r\nlaying the foundation of a reputation by a large undertaking seemed too\r\nfavorable to be refused. The first volume is already finished, and the\r\nprinting was begun some weeks ago.... Already forty colored folio plates\r\nare completed. Will it not seem strange when the largest and finest book\r\nin papa's library is one written by his Louis? Will it not be as good\r\nas to see his prescription at the apothecary's? It is true that this\r\nfirst effort will bring me in but little; nothing at all, in fact,\r\nbecause M. de Martius has assumed all the expenses, and will, of course,\r\nreceive the profits. My share will be a few copies of the book, and\r\nthese I shall give to the friends who have the first claim.\"\r\n\r\nHe writes to his father, as though half apologizing for the fact that he\r\nis writing a book on natural history, at the same time showing the real\r\npurpose of his life: \"I wish it may be said of Louis Agassiz that he was\r\nthe first naturalist of his time, a good citizen, and a good son,\r\nbeloved of those who knew him. I feel within myself the strength of a\r\nwhole generation to work toward this end, and I will reach it if the\r\nmeans are not wanting.\"\r\n\r\nThus early in life he had fixed the mark to which he would attain, \"the\r\nfirst naturalist of his time.\" No wonder he succeeded, when he felt\r\nwithin himself \"the strength of a whole generation to work toward this\r\nend.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1829, when he was twenty-two, the first part of the\r\n\"Brazilian Fishes\" was published, and a copy sent to the fond parents.\r\nGood M. Agassiz wrote back: \"I have no terms in which to express the\r\npleasure it has given me. In two words, for I have only a moment to\r\nmyself, I repeat my urgent entreaty that you would hasten your return as\r\nmuch as possible.... The old father, who waits for you with open heart\r\nand arms, sends you the most tender greeting.\" He had been devoting his\r\ntime to science--just what they feared,--but how proud they were to have\r\nhim succeed!\r\n\r\nCuvier, the great leader in zooelogy, to whom the book was dedicated,\r\nwrote back: \"You and M. de Martius have done me honor in placing my name\r\nat the head of a work so admirable as the one you have just published.\r\nThe importance and the rarity of the species therein described, as well\r\nas the beauty of the figures, will make the work an important one in\r\nichthyology, and nothing could heighten its value more than the accuracy\r\nof your descriptions. It will be of the greatest use to me in my\r\n'History of Fishes.'... I shall do all in my power to accelerate the\r\nsale among amateurs, either by showing it to such as meet at my house,\r\nor by calling attention to it in scientific journals.\"\r\n\r\nAnother project had now taken form in Agassiz's active brain, his great\r\nwork on \"Poissons Fossiles,\" which a few years later placed him in the\r\nfront rank of scientific men. He wrote to Auguste: \"Having, by\r\npermission of the director of the museum, one of the finest collections\r\nof fossils in Germany at my disposition, and being also allowed to take\r\nthe specimens home as I need them, I have undertaken to publish the\r\nichthyological part of the collection. Since it only makes the\r\ndifference of one or two people more to direct, I have these specimens\r\nalso drawn at the same time. Nowhere so well as here, where the Academy\r\nof Fine Arts brings together so many draughtsmen, could I have the same\r\nfacility for completing a similar work; and as it is an entirely new\r\nbranch, in which no one has as yet done anything of importance, I feel\r\nsure of success; the more so because Cuvier, who alone could do it (for\r\nthe single reason that every one else has till now neglected the\r\nfishes), is not engaged upon it. Add to this that just now there is a\r\nreal need of this work for the determination of the different geological\r\nformations.\" And then he urges Auguste to intercede with his uncle at\r\nNeuchatel for one hundred louis. \"At this very time, when he was keeping\r\ntwo or three artists on his slender means,\" says his wife, \"he made his\r\nown breakfast in his room, and dined for a few cents a day at the\r\ncheapest eating-houses. But where science was concerned the only economy\r\nhe recognized, either in youth or old age, was that of an expenditure as\r\nbold as it was carefully considered.\"\r\n\r\nHe was now at work finishing the \"Brazilian Fishes,\" and carrying\r\nforward the \"Fresh-Water Fishes\" and the \"Fossil Fishes.\" Besides these,\r\nhe read medical works till midnight, and wrote seventy-four theses on\r\nanatomical, pathological, surgical, and obstetrical subjects.\r\n\r\nHe took his degree of medicine April 3, 1830. He writes to his mother:\r\n\"The whole ceremony lasted nine days. At the close, while they\r\nconsidered my case, I was sent out of the room. On my return, the dean\r\nsaid to me, 'The faculty have been _very much_' (emphasized) 'pleased\r\nwith your answers; they congratulate themselves on being able to give\r\nthe diploma to a young man who has already acquired so honorable a\r\nreputation.' ... The rector then added that he should look upon it as\r\nthe brightest moment of his rectorship when he conferred upon me the\r\ntitle I had so well merited.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the glad mother writes back: \"I cannot thank you enough, my dear\r\nLouis, for the happiness you have given me in completing your medical\r\nexaminations, and thus securing to yourself a career as safe as it is\r\nhonorable.... You have for my sake gone through a long and arduous task;\r\nwere it in my power I would gladly reward you, but I cannot even say\r\nthat I love you the more for it, because that is impossible. My anxious\r\nsolicitude for your future is a proof of my ardent affection for you;\r\nonly one thing was wanting to make me the happiest of mothers, and this,\r\nmy Louis, you have just given me.\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz had taken the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, a year earlier.\r\n\"The time had come,\" said he, years afterward, \"when even the small\r\nallowance I received from borrowed capital must cease. I was now\r\ntwenty-four years of age. I was Doctor of Philosophy and Medicine, and\r\nauthor of a quarto volume on the fishes of Brazil. I had travelled on\r\nfoot all over Southern Germany, visited Vienna, and explored extensive\r\ntracts of the Alps. I knew every animal, living and fossil, in the\r\nmuseums of Munich, Stuttgart, Tuebingen, Erlangen, Wurzburg, Carlsruhe,\r\nand Frankfort; but my prospects were as dark as ever, and I saw no hope\r\nof making my way in the world, except by the practical pursuit of my\r\nprofession as physician.\"\r\n\r\nDecember 4, 1830, Agassiz said good-by to Munich, and started with Mr.\r\nDinkel, his artist, for Concise, his father having moved there from\r\nOrbe. Here he remained a year, arranging, meantime, his own valuable\r\ncollections in natural history, at the house of his grandfather Mayor,\r\nat Cudrefin, on Lake Neuchatel, and practising a little in medicine, in\r\nthe neighboring villages.\r\n\r\nHe longed to go to Paris for study, but poverty was his constant\r\ncompanion. Finally, an old friend of his father, a Swiss clergyman, M.\r\nChristinot, having come into possession of a small amount of money,\r\nurged his young friend to take it. His uncle also contributed a little,\r\nand Agassiz and Dinkel left for Paris in September, 1831.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival they found inexpensive lodgings, and at once began to\r\nwork in the museums. He writes to his sister Olympe: \"M. Cuvier and M.\r\nHumboldt especially treat me on all occasions as an equal, and\r\nfacilitate for me the use of the scientific collections so that I can\r\nwork here as if I were at home.... In the morning I follow the chemical\r\ncourses at the Pitie.... At ten o'clock, or perhaps at eleven, I\r\nbreakfast, and then go to the Museum of Natural History, where I stay\r\ntill dark. Between five and six I dine, and after that turn to such\r\nmedical studies as do not require daylight.... On Saturday only, I spend\r\nthe evening at M. Cuvier's.\"\r\n\r\nHe writes later to his brother that there is another excellent reason\r\nwhy he does not spend more evenings in society, because he has \"no\r\npresentable coat.... You can imagine that, after the fuel bill for the\r\nwinter is paid, little remains for other expenses out of my two hundred\r\nfrancs a month, five louis of which are always due to my companion. Far\r\nfrom having anything in advance, my month's supply is thus taken up at\r\nonce.\" Evidently he had no more money than when he and Auguste copied\r\nwhole volumes at the Zurich school.\r\n\r\nCuvier was so much drawn to the young naturalist that he gave him and\r\nhis artist a corner in one of his own laboratories, and, more than this,\r\nhis drawings of fossil fishes and notes which he had taken in the\r\nBritish Museum and elsewhere. Cuvier said, three months later, with\r\nregard to some work, \"You are young; you have time enough for it, and I\r\nhave none to spare.\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz now studied fifteen hours daily, sometimes seventeen. Cuvier\r\ncommended his devotion, but said one evening as he left him, \"Be\r\ncareful, and remember that _work kills_.\" The next day he was paralyzed\r\nand died soon after, Agassiz never seeing him again.\r\n\r\nIt became evident that Paris, with her scientific treasures, could not\r\nbe enjoyed longer. He must go back to Switzerland, and find a place to\r\nteach, as his sympathetic mother urged him to do. Just when the sky was\r\ndarkest, a letter came from Humboldt, enclosing a check for one thousand\r\nfrancs! \"Consider it,\" he said, \"an advance which need not be paid for\r\nyears, and which I will gladly increase when I go away or even earlier.\r\nIt would pain me deeply should the urgency of my request, made in the\r\nclosest confidence,--in short, a transaction as between two friends of\r\nunequal age,--be disagreeable to you. I should wish to be pleasantly\r\nremembered by a young man of your character. Yours, with the most\r\naffectionate respect, Alexander Humboldt.\"\r\n\r\nHow delicately offered was this charity in the guise of a loan! To give\r\nis blessed; to give without wounding the recipient is more blessed\r\nstill!\r\n\r\nThe tender heart of Agassiz was deeply moved. He wrote his mother: \"Oh!\r\nif my mother would forget for one moment that this is the celebrated M.\r\nde Humboldt, and find courage to write him only a few lines, how\r\ngrateful I should be to her. I think it would come better from her than\r\nfrom papa, who would do it more correctly, no doubt, but perhaps not\r\nquite as I should like.\"\r\n\r\nShe wrote a thankful letter, and the great man replied: \"I should scold\r\nyour son, madame, for having spoken to you of the slight mark of\r\ninterest I have been able to show him; and yet, how can I complain of a\r\nletter so touching, so noble in sentiment, as the one I have just\r\nreceived from your hand? Accept my warmest thanks for it.... One might\r\nwell despair of the world if a person like your son, with information so\r\nsubstantial and manners so sweet and prepossessing, should fail to make\r\nhis way.\"\r\n\r\nThis money made it possible for Agassiz to work in Paris, until a\r\nprofessorship of Natural History was created for him at Neuchatel,\r\nthrough the influence of Humboldt and others. Humboldt wrote: \"Agassiz\r\nis distinguished by his talents, by the variety and substantial\r\ncharacter of his attainments, and by that which has a special value in\r\nthese troubled times, his natural sweetness of disposition.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"sweetness of disposition\" was worth more to Agassiz, all through\r\nlife, than a fortune. It drew everybody to him. It opened the pockets of\r\nthe wealthy to carry forward his great projects. It won the hearts of\r\nhis pupils on two hemispheres. It made his home a delight, and his\r\npresence a constant blessing.\r\n\r\nHe assumed the duties of his professorship at Neuchatel in the autumn of\r\n1832, giving his first lecture, \"Upon the Relations between the\r\ndifferent branches of Natural History and the then prevailing tendencies\r\nof all the Sciences,\" November 12, at the Hotel de Ville. A society for\r\nthe study of the natural sciences was soon formed, and Agassiz became\r\nits secretary. So natural, so enthusiastic, so full of his subject, was\r\nhe, that everybody became interested. To little companies of his friends\r\nand neighbors he lectured on botany, on zooelogy, and the philosophy of\r\nnature. Even the children were delighted to gather and be told how\r\nlakes, springs, rivers, and valleys are formed.\r\n\r\n\"When it was impossible to give the lessons out-of-doors, the children\r\nwere gathered around a large table, where each one had before him or her\r\nthe specimens of the day, sometimes stones and fossils, sometimes\r\nflowers, fruits, or dried plants.... When the talk was of tropical or\r\ndistant countries, pains were taken to procure characteristic specimens,\r\nand the children were introduced to dates, bananas, cocoa-nuts, and\r\nother fruits, not to be easily obtained in those days in a small inland\r\ntown. They, of course, concluded the lesson by eating the specimen, a\r\npractical illustration which they greatly enjoyed.\"\r\n\r\nThree months after his settlement at Neuchatel, where eighty louis had\r\nbeen guaranteed to him for three years, he was invited to Heidelberg, to\r\nsucceed his former professor, Leuckart, in zooelogy. He would receive a\r\nsalary of five hundred florins, besides about fifteen hundred gulden for\r\nlectures and literary work. He declined the honor, because he wished\r\nmore time to devote to his writing. The following year Neuchatel\r\npurchased his collections in natural history, thus affording him some\r\npecuniary aid in his work.\r\n\r\nA serious misfortune now threatened him in the loss of sight. Having\r\ninjured his eyes by microscopic work, for several months he was shut up\r\nin a dark room, practising the study of his fossils by touch alone; by\r\nthe tongue when the fingers were not sufficiently sensitive to feel out\r\nthe impression. With great care his eyes improved, so that he was able\r\nto use them through life more constantly than most persons.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1833, when he was twenty-six, Agassiz married Cecile Braun\r\nof Carlsruhe, the sister of his life-long friend Alexander. They began\r\nhousekeeping in a small apartment at Neuchatel, both practising the\r\nclosest economy that the books might be carried on; the \"Fresh-Water\r\nFishes,\" and the \"Fossil Fishes.\" She was a skilful artist, had done\r\nmuch work for her brother in botany, and now helped her young husband in\r\ndrawing and coloring his fishes.\r\n\r\nThe first number of the \"Fossil Fishes\" had already appeared, with the\r\nfollowing title, which shows the plan of the great work, to which he\r\ndevoted ten years, from 1833 to 1843:--\r\n\r\n\"Researches on the Fossil Fishes: comprising an Introduction to the\r\nStudy of these Animals; the Comparative Anatomy of Organic Systems which\r\nmay contribute to facilitate the Determination of Fossil Species; a New\r\nClassification of Fishes, expressing their relations to the Series of\r\nFormations; the Explanation of the Laws of their Succession and\r\nDevelopment during all the Changes of the Terrestrial Globe, accompanied\r\nby General Geological Considerations; finally, the Description of about\r\na thousand Species which no longer exist, and whose Characters have\r\nbeen restored from Remains contained in the Strata of the Earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe work was inscribed to Humboldt. \"These pages owe to you their\r\nexistence; accept their dedication.\" It met everywhere the most\r\nfavorable reception. Elie de Beaumont wrote to Agassiz: \"It promises a\r\nwork as important for science as it is remarkable in execution. Do not\r\nlet yourself be discouraged by obstacles of any kind; they will give way\r\nbefore the concert of approbation which so excellent a work will\r\nawaken.\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz had become known to scholars throughout Europe, as an\r\nindefatigable worker, but he was still poor. Now and then there came a\r\ngleam of sunshine into the straitened life. In 1834, he was greatly\r\nsurprised to receive from the London Geological Society, through Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, the Wollaston prize, of about one hundred and fifty\r\ndollars, conferred upon him for his work on fishes.\r\n\r\nHe writes back to Lyell: \"You cannot imagine the joy your letter has\r\ngiven me. The prize awarded me is at once so unexpected an honor and so\r\nwelcome an aid that I could hardly believe my eyes when, with tears of\r\nrelief and gratitude, I read your letter. In the presence of a savant, I\r\nneed not be ashamed of my penury, since I have spent the little I had\r\nwholly in scientific researches. I do not, therefore, hesitate to\r\nconfess to you that at no time could your gift have given me greater\r\npleasure. Generous friends have helped me to bring out the first number\r\nof my 'Fossil Fishes;' the plates of the second are finished, but I was\r\ngreatly embarrassed to know how to print a sufficient number of copies\r\nbefore the returns from the first should be paid in. The text is ready\r\nalso, so that now, in a fortnight, I can begin the distribution, and,\r\nthe rotation once established, I hope that preceding numbers will always\r\nenable me to publish the next in succession without interruption. I even\r\ncount upon this resource as affording me the means of making a journey\r\nto England before long.\"\r\n\r\nIn August, 1834, Agassiz went to England, and there formed delightful\r\nfriendships with such men as Lyell, Murchison, Buckland, and others. He\r\nwas allowed to cull, from sixty or more collections, some two thousand\r\nfossil fishes, and deposit them in the Somerset House in London, where\r\nMr. Dinkel, the artist, remained for several years at work, copying.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1836, he began his remarkable study of the glaciers. He\r\nwas so cramped for means to carry forward his \"Fossil Fishes,\" that it\r\nseemed probable that he must discontinue it, when opportunely his\r\noriginal drawings were purchased by Lord Francis Egerton and given to\r\nthe British Museum. The financial condition was thus bettered for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHis investigation of the slopes of the Jura led to an address before the\r\nHelvetic Association assembled at Neuchatel in 1837, in which he said:\r\n\"Siberian winter established itself for a time over a world previously\r\ncovered with a rich vegetation and peopled with large mammalia, similar\r\nto those now inhabiting the warm regions of India and Africa. Death\r\nenveloped all nature in a shroud, and the cold, having reached its\r\nhighest degree, gave to this mass of ice, at the maximum of tension, the\r\ngreatest possible hardness.\" He showed how huge boulders had been\r\ndistributed over the continent.\r\n\r\nHis views excited much opposition, from most of the older geologists.\r\nEven Humboldt said, \"Your ice frightens me.\" But the discussion\r\nconvinced the scientific world that Agassiz was both original and\r\nbrilliant. He was soon called to a professorship of geology and\r\nmineralogy at Geneva, with a salary of three thousand francs, and also\r\nto Lausanne; but he refused both offers. So pleased were the people of\r\nNeuchatel that they made him accept a present of six thousand francs,\r\npayable during three years.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, Agassiz founded a lithographic printing establishment in\r\nNeuchatel, where his work could be done under his own direction instead\r\nof in Munich. He was now, besides his duties as professor, at work on\r\n\"Living and Fossil Echinoderms and Mollusks,\" as well as \"Fresh-Water\r\nand Fossil Fishes,\" and soon after upon the \"Etudes sur les Glaciers,\"\r\nwith an atlas of thirty-two plates. The book gave an account of all\r\nprevious glacial study, and the observations of himself and companions.\r\n\r\n\"Agassiz displayed during these years,\" said one of his co-workers, \"an\r\nincredible energy, of which the history of science offers, perhaps, no\r\nother example.\" He worked always till midnight, often till two or three\r\no'clock, sitting for hours at his microscope, troubled much with\r\ncongestion of the head and eyes. The expense involved in his work was\r\nenormous, and he was burdening himself with debts, which are more\r\nwearing and destructive to health and happiness than any amount of work\r\ncan ever be.\r\n\r\nStill he struggled on, through these dark days of poverty. He was only\r\nthirty-three, so young-looking that, on seeing him, people asked if he\r\nwere \"the son of the celebrated professor of Neuchatel.\" He had already\r\nbeen chosen a member of the Royal Society of London.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 he made his first permanent station on the Alps, taking with him\r\nbarometers, thermometers, hygrometers, psychometers, boring apparatus,\r\nand microscopes, making the Hospice of the Grimsel his base of supplies,\r\nand the lower Aar glacier the scene of his work. A huge boulder, its\r\nupper surface forming a roof, with a stone wall constructed on one side,\r\nbecame the sleeping-room of Agassiz and five friends. This abode was\r\ncalled the Hotel des Neuchatelois. Jacob Leuthold, an intrepid Swiss,\r\nwas their chief guide. He died at thirty-seven, sincerely mourned by\r\nall. They made dangerous ascents of snow-covered peaks, measured the\r\ndepth and forward movement of glaciers, Agassiz even being lowered by\r\nropes one hundred and twenty-five feet into a glacial well, to\r\ninvestigate its formation.\r\n\r\nAll Europe was becoming interested in glaciers. Edward Forbes wrote from\r\nEdinburgh: \"You have made all the geologists glacier-mad here, and they\r\nare turning Great Britain into an ice-house.\" Darwin was deeply\r\ninterested. He wrote from North Wales: \"The valley about here and the\r\nsite of the inn at which I am now writing must once have been covered by\r\nat least eight hundred or one thousand feet in thickness of solid ice!\r\nEleven years ago I spent a whole day in the valley where yesterday\r\neverything but the ice of the glaciers was palpably clear to me, and I\r\nthen saw nothing but plain water and bare rock.\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz now began work on his \"Nomenclator Zooelogicus,\" and his\r\n\"Bibliographia Zooelogiae et Geologiae,\" the former comprising \"an\r\nenumeration of all the genera of the animal kingdom, with the etymology\r\nof their names, the names of those who had first proposed them, and the\r\ndate of their publication.\" The latter contained a list of all the\r\nauthors named in the Nomenclator, with notices of their works. This was\r\npublished by the Royal Society in England, in 1848, the expense being\r\ntoo great for one person.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the \"Fossil Fishes,\" in five large volumes, was completed, and\r\nthe following year his \"Monograph on the Fossil Fishes of the Old Red\r\nSandstone, or the Devonian System of Great Britain and Russia,\" was\r\npublished, a large volume accompanied by forty-one plates. The\r\ndiscovery of these fossils was due to Hugh Miller, whose interesting\r\nlife and pathetic death will always be associated with the study of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1846, a great change took place in the life of the\r\noverworked naturalist. He had long hoped to visit the United States for\r\nscientific investigation, and now the time had come. The King of\r\nPrussia, at the request of Humboldt, granted him fifteen thousand francs\r\nfor this purpose--he had previously given Agassiz one thousand dollars\r\nfor his glacial researches.... Leaving his wife and daughters with\r\nAlexander Braun, her brother, at Carlsruhe, and his son Alexander at\r\nschool at Neuchatel, Agassiz said good-by to his students, who came at\r\ntwo o'clock at night, in procession with torchlights. Going to Paris, he\r\nspent some time in bringing out his second work upon the glaciers,\r\n\"Systeme Glaciaire,\" receiving the Monthyon Prize of Physiology from the\r\nAcademy, and sailed for America in September, 1846.\r\n\r\nHumboldt wrote him from Sans-Souci: \"Be happy in this new undertaking,\r\nand preserve for me the first place under the head of friendship in your\r\nheart. When you return, I shall be here no more, but the king and queen\r\nwill receive you on this historic hill with the affection which, for so\r\nmany reasons, you merit. Your illegible but much attached friend.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell, of England, who had given a successful course of\r\nlectures before the Lowell Institute, Boston, arranged a similar course\r\nwith Mr. Lowell for his friend Agassiz. Perhaps money has never been\r\ngiven more wisely in our country than by the refined John Lowell, Jr.,\r\nof Boston, who, dying in a foreign country at thirty-seven, bereft of\r\nwife and children, left a quarter of a million dollars to \"provide for\r\nregular courses of _free_ public lectures upon the most important\r\nbranches of natural and moral science, to be annually delivered in the\r\ncity of Boston.\" None of the bequest could be used for buildings, and\r\nten per cent. of the accumulation of the fund was to be set aside\r\nannually to continue it. Since December 1, 1839, from six to ten courses\r\nhave been given yearly to large audiences, by some of the most\r\ndistinguished persons in Europe and America.\r\n\r\n\"Natural and moral science!\" How broad the subject, and how incalculable\r\nthe benefit to any city, great or small! What a means for the best\r\ngeneral education; what an uplifting of the whole mental and social life\r\nof a community!\r\n\r\nAgassiz came to Boston and gave twelve lectures on the \"Plan of the\r\nCreation, especially in the Animal Kingdom.\" His speech had a foreign\r\naccent; but his enthusiastic love of his subject, his skill in drawing\r\non the blackboard, and his eloquent but simple language soon won all\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nHe was as pleased with the Americans as they were with him. He wrote to\r\nhis beloved mother (his father had died ten years before): \"I can only\r\nsay that the educated Americans are very accessible and very pleasant.\r\nThey are obliging to the utmost degree; indeed, their cordiality toward\r\nstrangers exceeds any that I have met elsewhere.... The liberality of\r\nthe American naturalists toward me is unparalleled.... The government\r\n(of the State of New York) has just completed the publication of a work\r\nunique of its kind, a natural history of the State in sixteen volumes,\r\nquarto, with plates. Twenty-five hundred copies have been printed, only\r\nfive hundred of which are for sale, the rest being distributed\r\nthroughout the State. Four volumes are devoted to geology and mining\r\nalone; the others, to zooelogy, botany, and agriculture. Yes, twenty-five\r\nhundred copies of a work in sixteen volumes, quarto, scattered\r\nthroughout the State of New York alone!\r\n\r\n\"When I think that I began my studies in natural history by copying\r\nhundreds of pages from a Lamarck which some one had lent me, and that\r\nto-day there is a state in which the smallest farmer may have access to\r\na costly work, worth a library to him in itself, I bless the efforts of\r\nthose who devote themselves to public instruction.\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz was at once asked to give a second course before the Lowell\r\nInstitute, on glaciers. This, like the first, was greatly enjoyed by the\r\ntwo thousand or more persons present. Invitations now came from other\r\ncities, but he said, \"I will limit myself to what I need in order to\r\nrepay those who have helped me through a difficult crisis.... Beyond\r\nthat all must go again to science,--there lies my true mission.\"\r\n\r\nHe passed his fortieth birthday, May 28, 1847, with Dr. B. E. Cotting,\r\ncurator of the Lowell Institute, at whose home he had stayed through\r\nsome weeks of illness. His host, seeing him standing thoughtfully at the\r\nwindow, said, \"Why so sad?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I am so old and have done so little,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1847, Agassiz rented a small house in East Boston,\r\nsufficiently near to the ocean to study marine animals. He also gave\r\nlectures in New York, Philadelphia, Albany, and other eastern cities.\r\n\r\nThe next spring, the Lawrence Scientific School was organized at\r\nCambridge, in connection with Harvard University, and Agassiz was\r\noffered the chair of Natural History (zooelogy and geology), with a\r\nsalary of fifteen hundred dollars. The school owed its existence to\r\nAbbott Lawrence, formerly our minister to England.\r\n\r\nAgassiz accepted the position, and opened his first course in April,\r\n1848. Here he found congenial friends, Longfellow, Lowell, Prescott,\r\nMotley, Gray, Holmes, and others. M. Christinot, who had so generously\r\nhelped to send him to Paris years before, came to the Cambridge home and\r\nwas put in charge of it. \"If your old friend,\" he said, \"can live with\r\nhis son Louis, it will be the height of his happiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe small plot of ground about the house became a zooelogical garden,\r\nwith its tank for turtles and an alligator, its cage for eagles, a tame\r\nbear, and a family of opossums. Agassiz had already begun his Museum of\r\nComparative Zooelogy, on the banks of the Charles River, in an old\r\nshanty. The outlook was hopeful; but he was sad at heart, for Cecile,\r\nhis wife, had died since he came to America, and his children seemed too\r\nyoung to bring into a home where there was no mother.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1848, Agassiz organized an expedition of students and\r\nnaturalists for the examination of the eastern and northern shores of\r\nLake Superior. At Niagara, he saw for the first time a living garpike,\r\nthe only representative among modern fishes of the fossil type of\r\nLepidosteus. He made a careful study of the fauna and geology of the\r\nlake, and the results were published in a book. Charles Darwin wrote, \"I\r\nhave seldom been more deeply gratified than by receiving your most kind\r\npresent of 'Lake Superior.' ... I had heard of it, and had much wished\r\nto read it, but I confess it was the very great honor of having in my\r\npossession a work with your autograph as a presentation copy that has\r\ngiven me such lively and sincere pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz had published another book in America, in 1848, \"Principles of\r\nZooelogy,\" which had a large sale, and was much used in schools. In 1849,\r\nhis only son, fifteen years old, came to live with his father. The\r\nfollowing year, 1850, Agassiz married Elizabeth Cabot Gary, of Boston, a\r\ncultivated and lovely woman. His daughters, much younger than their\r\nbrother, arrived from Europe the same year. M. Christinot, though urged\r\nto remain, now preferred to find another home, settled in New Orleans as\r\npastor, and later died in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1851 was spent in the examination of the Florida reefs and\r\nkeys, a work undertaken at the request of Prof. A. D. Bache, at the head\r\nof the United States Coast Survey. The results were valuable in showing\r\n\"how far the soil now building up from accumulations of mud and coral\r\ndebris was likely to remain for a long time shifting and uncertain, and\r\nhow far and in what localities it might be relied upon as affording a\r\nstable foundation,\" for building lighthouses, etc. Agassiz brought back\r\nfor his museum a fine collection of corals, of all varieties and in all\r\nstages of growth, with drawings made on the spot, from the living\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThis year he accepted a professorship at the medical college in\r\nCharleston, S. C., lecturing during the three winter months, between his\r\nautumn and spring courses at Cambridge. The overwork finally resulted in\r\na dangerous illness, and he was obliged to discontinue it in 1853. The\r\nyear previous he received the Prix Cuvier for his \"Fossil Fishes.\" His\r\nfond mother wrote: \"This has given me such happiness, dear Louis, that\r\nthe tears are in my eyes as I write it to you.\"\r\n\r\nHe now issued a circular asking for collections of fishes from various\r\nfresh-water systems of the United States, and responses came from every\r\ndirection. New England captains, when they started on a cruise, took out\r\ncans, furnished by Agassiz, for collections in distant ports. Fishermen\r\nand farmers, indeed all classes, heartily joined in cooeperating with the\r\nman who had said in the University at Munich, \"I will be a leader of\r\nothers,\" and he had reached the mark which he set for himself. In 1854\r\nhe was urged to accept a professorship in the recently established\r\nUniversity of Zurich, Switzerland; but he declined, for he had one\r\ndefinite aim in America, to found a great museum, where the best methods\r\nof study could be adopted. He said in his \"Fossil Fishes\": \"Possessing\r\nno fossil fishes myself, and renouncing forever the acquisition of\r\ncollections so precious, I have been forced to seek the materials for my\r\nwork in all the collections of Europe containing such remains; I have,\r\ntherefore, made frequent journeys in Germany, in France, and in England,\r\nin order to examine, describe, and illustrate the objects of my\r\nresearches; but, notwithstanding the cordiality with which even the most\r\nprecious specimens have been placed at my disposition, a serious\r\ninconvenience has resulted from this mode of working, namely, that I\r\nhave rarely been able to compare directly the various specimens of the\r\nsame species from different collections, and that I have often been\r\nobliged to make my identification from memory, or from simple notes, or,\r\nin the more fortunate cases, from my drawings only. It is impossible to\r\nimagine the fatigue, the exhaustion of all the faculties, involved in\r\nsuch a method.\" He hoped to found a museum where students should have\r\nspecimens for work, ready for their use.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1855, Agassiz, resumed his public lectures, as his\r\nsalary of fifteen hundred was insufficient to support his family, but\r\nwhen the spring came he found himself exhausted by the extra work.\r\n\r\nAnd now his noble wife thought out a plan to aid him. She opened a\r\nschool in their house, for young ladies. Agassiz's surprise and pleasure\r\nknew no bounds when he was informed of the project. He immediately took\r\ncharge of the classes in physical geography, natural history, and\r\nbotany, giving a lecture daily on one or other of these subjects. The\r\nschool, with sixty or seventy girls, was continued for eight years,\r\nAgassiz having the cooeperation of his brother-in-law, Professor Felton,\r\nthe noted Greek scholar, and other distinguished men. This school was a\r\nblessing in more ways than one. All these years, the debts incurred by\r\nthe publication of the \"Fossil Fishes,\" and the glacial investigations,\r\nhad burdened him. The wonder was that the genial, untiring worker could\r\nlabor at all under this depressing load. Noble devotees to science! What\r\nhave they not suffered to advance the cause of knowledge! We sit by our\r\npleasant firesides and read what others have wrought for us, perhaps in\r\nwant and sorrow of soul, and we forget to be grateful or to help lift\r\nburdens.\r\n\r\nThis school opened by the helpful wife made Agassiz a free man--no\r\nlonger shackled by that worst form of slavery, debt. Well said John\r\nRuskin: \"My first word to all men and boys who care to hear me is, don't\r\nget into debt. Starve and go to heaven, but don't borrow.... Don't buy\r\nthings you can't pay for!\"\r\n\r\nIndefatigable, versatile, comprehensive in mind, Agassiz at once planned\r\nanother great work, to be published in ten volumes, though it was\r\nfinally reduced to four: \"Contributions to the Natural History of the\r\nUnited States.\" Mr. Francis C. Gray of Boston, a personal friend and a\r\nlover of letters and science, set the subscription before the public.\r\nVery soon, to Agassiz's great delight, he received the names of\r\nseventeen hundred subscribers, at twelve dollars a volume.\r\n\r\nHe had now reached his fiftieth birthday, completing his first volume of\r\nthe new work on that day. His students serenaded him, and Longfellow\r\nwrote, to be read at the \"Saturday Club,\" composed of Hawthorne, Holmes,\r\nLowell, Dana, and others, this exquisite poem:--\r\n\r\n  It was fifty years ago,\r\n    In the pleasant month of May,\r\n  In the beautiful Pays de Vaud,\r\n    A child in its cradle lay.\r\n\r\n  And Nature, the old nurse, took\r\n    The child upon her knee,\r\n  Saying: \"Here is a story-book\r\n    Thy Father has written for thee.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Come wander with me,\" she said,\r\n    \"Into regions yet untrod,\r\n  And read what is still unread\r\n    In the manuscripts of God.\"\r\n\r\n  And he wandered away and away\r\n    With Nature, the dear old nurse,\r\n  Who sang to him night and day\r\n    The rhymes of the universe.\r\n\r\n  And whenever the way seemed long,\r\n    Or his heart began to fail,\r\n  She would sing a more wonderful song,\r\n    Or tell a more marvellous tale.\r\n\r\n  So she keeps him still a child,\r\n    And will not let him go,\r\n  Though at times his heart beats wild\r\n    For the beautiful Pays de Vaud;\r\n\r\n  Though at times he hears in his dreams\r\n    The Ranz des Vaches of old,\r\n  And the rush of mountain streams\r\n    From glaciers clear and cold;\r\n\r\n  And the mother at home says, \"Hark!\r\n    For his voice I listen and yearn;\r\n  It is growing late and dark,\r\n    And my boy does not return!\"\r\n\r\nThis year, 1857, Agassiz received an unexpected honor--a call to one of\r\nthe most coveted places at the Jardin des Plantes; the chair of\r\npalaeontology in the Museum of Natural History, Paris. Though obliged to\r\nrefuse it because he considered his life-work to be in America, he\r\nappreciated the favor as also the bestowal of the Order of the Legion\r\nof Honor, and the Copley medal from England. Twenty-seven years before,\r\nhe had received in Paris the aid of Humboldt in his destitution; now,\r\ntwo hemispheres competed for his services.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1858, Mr. Francis C. Gray died, leaving fifty\r\nthousand dollars for the establishment of a Museum of Comparative\r\nZooelogy, to be used neither for buildings nor for salaries, but purely\r\nfor scientific needs.\r\n\r\n\"All things come round to him who will but wait,\" says Longfellow, in\r\nthe \"Falcon of Sir Federigo.\" Other gifts soon followed. Harvard\r\nUniversity gave land for the site of the building. The Massachusetts\r\nLegislature gave lands to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars.\r\nOver seventy-one thousand was promptly subscribed by citizens of Boston\r\nand Cambridge. Agassiz contributed all his collections, worth thousands\r\nof dollars. The corner-stone of the museum was laid one sunny afternoon\r\nin June, 1859, and then the happy Agassiz hastened across the ocean, to\r\nrejoice with his mother, in her home near the foot of the Jura. She was\r\nglad and proud now that he had become a naturalist.\r\n\r\nThe museum was dedicated November 13, 1860. The plan included a main\r\nbuilding 364 feet long, with wings 205 long, the whole enclosing a\r\nhollow square. The lecture rooms were at once opened. Especially welcome\r\nwere teachers of schools, for whom admittance was free. His lectures\r\nwere open to women as well as to men. This would naturally be expected,\r\nfrom the broad-mindedness of the man, and the respect he must have had\r\nfor the capacity of woman, from such a mother and such a wife. \"He had\r\ngreat sympathy,\" says Mrs. Agassiz, \"with the desire of women for larger\r\nand more various fields of study and work.\" To such men women can never\r\nbe too grateful.\r\n\r\nIn 1863, he helped to organize the National Academy of Sciences. He\r\nfrequently gave lectures in the large cities, using the money for the\r\nfurther development of the museum.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 he started, with his wife and several assistants, for sixteen\r\nmonths of scientific investigation in Brazil, the expenses borne by his\r\nfriend, Mr. Nathaniel Thayer, of Boston. He writes to his mother,--\r\n\r\n     \"All those who know me seem to have combined to heighten the\r\n     attraction of the journey, and facilitate it in every respect.\r\n     The Pacific Mail Steamship Company have invited me to take\r\n     passage with my whole party on their fine steamer, the Colorado.\r\n     They will take us, free of all expense, as far as Rio de\r\n     Janeiro,--an economy of fifteen thousand francs at the start....\r\n     I seem like the spoiled child of the country, and I hope God will\r\n     give me strength to repay, in devotion to her institutions and to\r\n     her scientific and intellectual development, all that her\r\n     citizens have done for me....\r\n\r\n                                              With all my heart,\r\n                                                       \"Your LOUIS.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of this expedition has been told, chiefly by Mrs. Agassiz, in\r\nthat most interesting volume, \"A Journey in Brazil.\"\r\n\r\nOn Agassiz's return, he gave a course of lectures before the Lowell\r\nInstitute, and the Cooper Institute, New York, spending the summer at\r\nhis pleasant seaside home and laboratory at Nahant.\r\n\r\nThe fisherman at Nahant would pull two or three miles to bring him a\r\nrare fish; and only for the pleasure of seeing him rush out of his\r\nlittle laboratory, crying: \"Oh! where _did_ you get that? That is a\r\nspecies which goes as far as Brazil. Nobody has ever seen it north of\r\nCape Cod. Come in, come in, and sit down!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1868, Agassiz, invited by Mr. Samuel Hooper, joined a party of\r\nfriends in an excursion to the Rocky Mountains. This year he was\r\nappointed non-resident professor at Cornell University, Ithaca, New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Legislature now gave seventy-five thousand dollars,\r\nand private individuals an equal sum, to provide for the new collections\r\nat the museum. Later, the museum received from the Legislature\r\ntwenty-five thousand more, and a birthday gift to Agassiz, of one\r\nhundred thousand dollars, was also used by him for his precious work.\r\nSeptember 15, 1869, at the Humboldt Centennial Celebration, Agassiz\r\ndelivered an eloquent address before the Boston Society of Natural\r\nHistory, and the \"Humboldt Scholarship\" was founded at the museum. The\r\nbread cast upon the waters by Humboldt had been found after many days.\r\n\r\nAgassiz was now completely prostrated by overwork, and told by his\r\nphysician that for the several months in which he remained shut up in\r\nhis room he must not think. Yet he could not banish one subject from his\r\nthoughts, and, with tears in his eyes, he would sometimes exclaim,--\"Oh,\r\nmy museum! my museum! always uppermost, by day and by night, in health\r\nand in sickness, always--_always_!\"\r\n\r\nThe great mind rallied for one more voyage of research in his beloved\r\nscience. In the coast-survey steamer Hassler, with his wife and friends,\r\nhe sailed December 4, 1871, around Cape Horn, landing at several places\r\nalong the coast, gathering rich treasures from deep-sea dredgings,\r\nentering the Golden Gate August 24, 1872.\r\n\r\nIn October, Agassiz returned to Cambridge. Through the gift of Mr. John\r\nAnderson, a wealthy New York merchant, of the island of Penikese, in\r\nBuzzard's Bay, with its buildings and an endowment of fifty thousand\r\ndollars, a summer school of natural history was at once opened. This\r\nyear was a very busy one. A series of articles were in preparation for\r\nthe \"Atlantic Monthly,\" in opposition to the views of Darwin on\r\nevolution. He had already published two successful books, \"Methods of\r\nStudy in Natural History,\" and \"Geological Sketches.\" December 2, 1873,\r\na lecture was given at Fitchburg, before a meeting of the Massachusetts\r\nBoard of Agriculture. The next day Agassiz spoke of dimness of sight,\r\nand of feeling \"strangely asleep,\" and on December 14 he was asleep in\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nHe was buried from the college chapel, the students who loved him laying\r\na wreath of laurel upon the bier, and singing his requiem. The noble\r\nmother, fortunately, had died six years before him.\r\n\r\nThey buried him at Mount Auburn. From the glacier of the Aar, not far\r\nfrom the spot where his little hut once stood, they brought a boulder\r\nfor his monument, and from his old home in Switzerland, pine trees to\r\ngrow beside his grave. He loved both countries, and both have shared in\r\nhis sacred resting-place.\r\n\r\nHis work will never cease. His museum at Cambridge now has seventy-one\r\nrooms and twelve galleries, with invested funds of over five hundred and\r\neighty thousand dollars, while the buildings and collections are valued\r\nat about seven hundred thousand dollars. It is now under the charge of\r\nProf. Alexander Agassiz, the son of Louis, and to his constant\r\ngenerosity and devotion the museum is deeply indebted.\r\n\r\nAgassiz said, \"My hope is that there shall arise upon the grounds of\r\nHarvard a museum of natural history which shall compete with the British\r\nMuseum and with the Jardin des Plantes. Do not say it cannot be done,\r\nfor you cannot suppose that what exists in England and France cannot be\r\nreached in America. I hope even that we shall found a museum which will\r\nbe based upon a more suitable foundation, and better qualified to\r\nadvance the highest interests of science than these institutions of the\r\nold world.\"\r\n\r\nAgassiz not only wrote books and built museums. He gave to the world a\r\nhigh ideal of a seeker after truth. He stimulated the intellectual\r\nactivity of two continents, and blessed both of them by his own\r\nbrilliant mind and his noble character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES ROBERT DARWIN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES ROBERT DARWIN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, April 26, 1882, sitting in the North Transept of\r\nWestminster Abbey, I looked upon a sad and impressive scene. Under the\r\ndome stood an oaken coffin, quite covered with white wreaths; close by\r\nwere seated the distinguished pall-bearers, Sir John Lubbock, Canon\r\nFarrar, the Duke of Argyle, Thomas H. Huxley, James Russell Lowell, and\r\nothers. Representatives of many nations were present; the great\r\nscientists of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Russia.\r\n\r\nOf the thousands who were gathered to honor the famous dead, every\r\nperson wore black, as requested on the cards of admission to the abbey.\r\nPerhaps never in the history of England have so many noted men been\r\nassembled on an occasion like this. As the choir, in their white robes,\r\nstood about the open grave, singing the \"Dead March from Saul,\" the\r\nstrains seemed to come from a far-off country, producing an effect never\r\nto be forgotten. Darwin lies buried close to the graves of Sir Isaac\r\nNewton and Sir John Herschel.\r\n\r\nAt Shrewsbury, England, February 12, 1809, Charles Robert Darwin was\r\nborn, in a square, red-brick house at the top of a terraced bank\r\nleading down to the Severn. The greenhouse with its varied plants, the\r\nornamental shrubs and trees in the grounds, became a delight as soon as\r\nthe boy was old enough to observe them.\r\n\r\nThe mother, Susannah, the daughter of Josiah Wedgwood of Etruria, a\r\nwoman with a sweet and happy face, died when Charles was eight years\r\nold, leaving five other children; Marianne, Caroline, Erasmus, Susan,\r\nand Catherine. Charles says of her in his autobiography, \"It is odd that\r\nI can remember hardly anything about her except her death-bed, her black\r\nvelvet gown, and her curiously constructed work-table.\" She evidently\r\nencouraged the boy's love for flowers, for he used to say, at school,\r\nthat his mother had taught him \"how, by looking at the inside of the\r\nblossom, the name of the plant could be discovered.\"\r\n\r\nThe father, Robert Waring Darwin, was a well known physician, a man of\r\nfine physique and courtly manner, who had amassed wealth by his skill\r\nand business ability. Charles's admiration of him was unbounded: \"the\r\nwisest man I ever knew,\" he used often to say.\r\n\r\n\"His chief mental characteristics,\" said Darwin, \"were his powers of\r\nobservation and his sympathy, neither of which have I ever seen exceeded\r\nor even equalled. His sympathy was not only with the distresses of\r\nothers, but in a greater degree with the pleasures of all around him.\r\nThis led him to be always scheming to give pleasure to others, and,\r\nthough hating extravagance, to perform many generous actions. For\r\ninstance, Mr. B----, a small manufacturer in Shrewsbury, came to him one\r\nday, and said he should be bankrupt unless he could at once borrow ten\r\nthousand pounds, but that he was unable to give any legal security. My\r\nfather heard his reasons for believing that he could ultimately repay\r\nthe money, and, from his intuitive perception of character, felt sure\r\nthat he was to be trusted. So he advanced this sum, which was a very\r\nlarge one for him while young, and was after a time repaid.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that it was his sympathy which gave him unbounded power of\r\nwinning confidence, and as a consequence made him highly successful as a\r\nphysician. He began to practise before he was twenty-one years old, and\r\nhis fees during the first year paid for the keep of two horses and a\r\nservant. On the following year his practice was large, and so continued\r\nfor about sixty years, when he ceased to attend on any one. His great\r\nsuccess as a doctor was the more remarkable as he told me that he at\r\nfirst hated his profession so much that if he had been sure of the\r\nsmallest pittance, or if his father had given him any choice, nothing\r\nshould have induced him to follow it. To the end of his life, the\r\nthought of an operation almost sickened him, and he could scarcely\r\nendure to see a person bled--a horror which he has transmitted to me.\"\r\n\r\nCharles went to the day-school in Shrewsbury, when he was eight years\r\nold. \"By the time I went to this day-school,\" he says, \"my taste for\r\nnatural history, and more especially for collecting, was well developed.\r\nI tried to make out the names of plants, and collected all sorts of\r\nthings, shells, seals, franks, coins, and minerals. The passion for\r\ncollecting, which leads a man to be a systematic naturalist, a virtuoso,\r\nor a miser, was very strong in me, and was clearly innate, as none of my\r\nsisters or brothers ever had this taste....\r\n\r\n\"I must have been a very simple little fellow when I first went to the\r\nschool. A boy of the name of Garnett took me into a cake-shop one day,\r\nand bought some cakes, for which he did not pay, as the shopman trusted\r\nhim. When he came out I asked him why he did not pay for them, and he\r\ninstantly answered, 'Why, do you not know that my uncle left a great sum\r\nof money to the town on condition that every tradesman should give\r\nwhatever was wanted without payment to any one who wore his old hat and\r\nmoved it in a particular manner?' and he then showed me how it was\r\nmoved. He then went into another shop where he was trusted, and asked\r\nfor some small article, moving his hat in the proper manner, and of\r\ncourse obtained it without payment.\r\n\r\n\"When we came out, he said: 'Now, if you like to go by yourself into\r\nthat cake-shop (how well I remember its exact position) I will lend you\r\nmy hat, and you can get whatever you like if you move the hat on your\r\nhead properly.' I gladly accepted the generous offer, and went in and\r\nasked for some cakes, moved the old hat and was walking out of the shop\r\nwhen the shopman made a rush at me, so I dropped the cakes and ran for\r\ndear life, and was astonished by being greeted with shouts of laughter\r\nby my false friend Garnett.\r\n\r\n\"In the summer of 1818, I went to Dr. Butler's great school in\r\nShrewsbury, and remained there for seven years, till midsummer, 1825,\r\nwhen I was sixteen years old. I boarded at this school, so that I had\r\nthe great advantage of living the life of a true schoolboy; but as the\r\ndistance was hardly more than a mile to my home, I very often ran there\r\nin the longer intervals between the callings over, and before locking up\r\nat night. This, I think, was in many ways advantageous to me, by keeping\r\nup home affections and interests. I remember, in the early part of my\r\nschool life, that I often had to run very quickly to be in time, and,\r\nfrom being a fleet runner, was generally successful; but when in doubt I\r\nprayed earnestly to God to help me, and I well remember that I\r\nattributed my success to the prayers and not to my quick running, and\r\nmarvelled how generally I was aided.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard my father and elder sister say that I had, as a very young\r\nboy, a strong taste for long, solitary walks; but what I thought about I\r\nknow not. I often became quite absorbed, and once, whilst returning to\r\nschool on the summit of the old fortifications round Shrewsbury, which\r\nhad been converted into a public footpath with no parapet on one side, I\r\nwalked off and fell to the ground, but the height was only seven or\r\neight feet. Nevertheless, the number of thoughts which passed through my\r\nmind during this very short but sudden and wholly unexpected fall was\r\nastonishing, and seem hardly compatible with what physiologists have, I\r\nbelieve, proved about each thought requiring quite an appreciable amount\r\nof time.\"\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Butler's school was strictly classical, Darwin always felt that,\r\nfor him, these years were nearly wasted. He read many authors,\r\nShakspeare, Thomson's Seasons, Byron, and Scott, but later in life, he\r\nsays, lost all taste for poetry. This he greatly regretted, and said, if\r\nhe were to live his life over, he would read some poetry every day. The\r\nbook that most influenced him was the \"Wonders of the World,\" which gave\r\nhim a desire to travel, which was finally realized in the voyage of the\r\nBeagle. He did not forget his zest in collecting, at first, however,\r\ntaking only such insects as he found dead, for, after consulting his\r\nsister, he \"concluded that it was not right to kill insects for the sake\r\nof making a collection. From reading White's 'Selborne,' I took much\r\npleasure in watching the habits of birds, and even made notes on the\r\nsubject. In my simplicity, I remember wondering why every gentleman did\r\nnot become an ornithologist.\r\n\r\n\"Towards the close of my school-life, my brother worked hard at\r\nchemistry, and made a fair laboratory, with proper apparatus, in the\r\ntool-house in the garden, and I was allowed to aid him as a servant in\r\nmost of his experiments. He made all the gases and many compounds, and I\r\nread with great care several books on chemistry, such as Henry and\r\nParkes' 'Chemical Catechism.' The subject interested me greatly, and we\r\noften used to go on working till rather late at night. This was the best\r\npart of my education at school, for it showed me practically the meaning\r\nof experimental science. The fact that we worked at chemistry somehow\r\ngot known at school, and, as it was an unprecedented fact, I was\r\nnicknamed 'Gas.'...\r\n\r\n\"When I left the school, I was for my age neither high nor low in it,\r\nand I believe that I was considered by all my masters and by my father\r\nas a very ordinary boy, rather below the common standard in intellect.\r\nTo my deep mortification, my father once said to me: 'You care for\r\nnothing but shooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace\r\nto yourself and all your family.' But my father, who was the kindest man\r\nI ever knew, and whose memory I love with all my heart, must have been\r\nangry and somewhat unjust when he used such words.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Darwin now sent his two boys, Erasmus and Charles, to Edinburgh\r\nUniversity. Here, Charles found the lectures \"intolerably dull,\" all\r\nexcept those on chemistry by Hope. His father, evidently not being able\r\nto determine for what his son was best fitted in life, suggested his\r\nbeing a doctor. The youth attended the clinical wards in the hospital,\r\nbut one day witnessing two operations, one upon a child, he rushed away.\r\nHe says, \"Nor did I attend again, for hardly any inducement would have\r\nbeen strong enough to make me do so; this being long before the blessed\r\ndays of chloroform. The two cases fairly haunted me for many a long\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in Edinburgh, Charles became deeply interested in marine zooelogy,\r\nand read a paper before the Plinian Society, an association organized\r\nfor the study of natural history. He also attended the meetings of the\r\nWernerian Society, where he heard Audubon deliver some interesting\r\nlectures upon the habits of North American birds, and the Royal Society,\r\nwhere he saw Sir Walter Scott in the chair as president.\r\n\r\n\"I looked at him and at the whole scene,\" says Darwin, \"with some awe\r\nand reverence, and I think it was owing to this visit during my youth,\r\nand to my having attended the Royal Medical Society, that I felt the\r\nhonor of being elected, a few years ago, an honorary member of both\r\nthese societies more than any other similar honor. If I had been told at\r\nthat time that I should one day have been thus honored, I declare that I\r\nshould have thought it as ridiculous and improbable as if I had been\r\ntold that I should be elected King of England.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Charles met Sir James Mackintosh, \"the best\r\nconverser,\" he says, \"I ever listened to. I heard afterwards, with a\r\nglow of pride, that he had said, 'There is something in that young man\r\nthat interests me.'... To hear of praise from an eminent person, though\r\nno doubt apt or certain to excite vanity, is, I think, good for a young\r\nman, as it helps to keep him in the right course.\"\r\n\r\nAfter two years at Edinburgh, Dr. Darwin, seeing that Charles probably\r\nwould never become a physician, sent him to Cambridge University, that\r\nhe might prepare for the Episcopal ministry.\r\n\r\nOf this time he says, \"The three years which I spent at Cambridge were\r\nwasted, as far as the academical studies were concerned, as completely\r\nas at Edinburgh and at school. I attempted mathematics, and even went\r\nduring the summer of 1828 with a private tutor (a very dull man) to\r\nBarmouth, but I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me,\r\nchiefly from my not being able to see any meaning in the early steps in\r\nalgebra.\" He found great delight in Paley's \"Evidences of Christianity,\"\r\nand his \"Moral Philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nAt Cambridge, like Humboldt, he formed a rare friendship, which helped\r\ntowards his subsequent success. Professor Henslow was an ardent scholar,\r\na devoted Christian, and a man of most winning manners and good temper.\r\nFrom his great knowledge of botany, entomology, chemistry, mineralogy,\r\nand geology, he became a most attractive person to young Darwin, whose\r\nespecial passion seemed to be the collecting of beetles. Henslow soon\r\nbecame equally fond of Darwin, and the two took long walks together\r\ndaily, Darwin being known as \"the man who walks with Henslow.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin said of this model teacher, years afterward, \"He had a remarkable\r\npower of making the young feel completely at ease with him; though we\r\nwere all awe-struck with the amount of his knowledge. Before I saw him,\r\nI heard one young man sum up his attainments by simply saying that he\r\nknew everything. When I reflect how immediately we felt at ease with a\r\nman older, and in every way immensely our superior, I think it was as\r\nmuch owing to the transparent sincerity of his character as to his\r\nkindness of heart, and, perhaps, even still more to a highly remarkable\r\nabsence in him of all self-consciousness. One perceived at once that he\r\nnever thought of his own varied knowledge or clear intellect, but solely\r\non the subject in hand.\r\n\r\n\"Another charm which must have struck every one was that his manner to\r\nold and distinguished persons and to the youngest student was exactly\r\nthe same; and to all he showed the same winning courtesy. He would\r\nreceive with interest the most trifling observation in any branch of\r\nnatural history, and, however absurd a blunder one might make, he\r\npointed it out so clearly and kindly that one left him no way\r\ndisheartened, but only determined to be more accurate the next time.\r\n\r\n\"His lectures on botany were universally popular, and as clear as\r\ndaylight. So popular were they that several of the older members of the\r\nUniversity attended successive courses. Once every week he kept open\r\nhouse in the evening, and all who cared for natural history attended\r\nthese parties, which, by thus favoring intercommunication, did the same\r\ngood in Cambridge, in a very pleasant manner, as the scientific\r\nsocieties do in London.... This was no small advantage to some of the\r\nyoung men, as it stimulated their mental activity and ambition....\r\n\r\n\"During the years when I associated so much with Professor Henslow, I\r\nnever once saw his temper even ruffled. He never took an ill-natured\r\nview of any one's character, though very far from blind to the foibles\r\nof others. It always struck me that his mind could not be even touched\r\nby any paltry feeling of vanity, envy, or jealousy. With all this\r\nequability of temper and remarkable benevolence, there was no insipidity\r\nof character. A man must have been blind not to have perceived that\r\nbeneath this placid exterior there was a vigorous and determined will.\r\nWhen principles came into play, no power on earth could have turned him\r\none hair's breadth....\r\n\r\n\"Reflecting over his character with gratitude and reverence, his moral\r\nattributes rise, as they should do in the highest character, in\r\npreeminence over his intellect.\"\r\n\r\nThrough this noble friend, Darwin had the opportunity of taking a five\r\nyears' voyage in the ship Beagle, as a naturalist. The bark, of two\r\nhundred and thirty-five tons, under command of Captain Fitz-Roy, was\r\ncommissioned by government to survey Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, the\r\nshores of Chili, Peru, and some islands in the Pacific, \"and to carry a\r\nchain of chronometrical measurements round the world.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Henslow knew the captain, and recommended his young friend for\r\nthe position. Darwin had read Humboldt's travels eagerly, and was\r\ndelighted with the prospect of a journey like this.\r\n\r\nDr. Darwin was opposed at first, but finally said, \"If you can find any\r\nman of common sense who advises you to go, I will give my consent.\"\r\nYoung Darwin at once visited his uncle, Josiah Wedgwood, at Maer, who\r\napproved of the journey, and soon convinced Dr. Darwin of the wisdom of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe vessel sailed December 27, 1831. Though for a young man of an\r\nextremely affectionate nature the separation from family was painful,\r\nyet it was a glad day for Darwin. He had looked forward eagerly to it,\r\nsaying, \"My second life will then commence, and it shall be as a\r\nbirthday for the rest of my life,\" and so it proved. He said, years\r\nafterward, \"The voyage of the Beagle has been by far the most important\r\nevent in my life, and has determined my whole career.\"\r\n\r\nThese years were busy, earnest ones, devoted to constant labor. To his\r\nfather he wrote from Bahia, or San Salvador, the following spring: \"No\r\nperson could imagine anything so beautiful as the ancient town of Bahia;\r\nit is fairly embosomed in a luxuriant wood of beautiful trees, and\r\nsituated on a steep bank, and overlooks the calm waters of the great Bay\r\nof All Saints. The houses are white and lofty, and, from the windows\r\nbeing narrow and long, have a very light and elegant appearance.... But\r\nthe exquisite, glorious pleasure of walking amongst such flowers and\r\nsuch trees cannot be comprehended but by those who have experienced\r\nit.... I will not rapturize again, but I give myself great credit in not\r\nbeing crazy out of pure delight. Give my love to every soul at home....\r\nI think one's affections, like other good things, flourish and increase\r\nin these tropical regions.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he writes from Rio de Janeiro: \"Here (at Rio-Macoa) I first saw a\r\ntropical forest in all its sublime grandeur--nothing but the reality can\r\ngive any idea how wonderful, how magnificent the scene is.... I never\r\nexperienced such intense delight. I formerly admired Humboldt, I now\r\nalmost adore him; he alone gives any notion of the feelings which are\r\nraised in the mind on first entering the Tropics. I am now collecting\r\nfresh-water and land animals.... I am at present red-hot with spiders;\r\nthey are very interesting, and, if I am not mistaken, I have already\r\ntaken some new genera.\" Busy as he was, he was ever thinking of home,\r\nand anxious to receive letters. When they were received, he almost\r\n\"cried for pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nHe writes to his sister: \"If you knew the glowing, unspeakable delight\r\nwhich I felt at being certain that my father and all of you were well,\r\nonly four months ago, you would not grudge the labor lost in keeping up\r\nthe regular series of letters.\"\r\n\r\nLater he writes: \"It is too delightful to think that I shall see the\r\nleaves fall and hear the robin sing next autumn at Shrewsbury. My\r\nfeelings are those of a schoolboy to the smallest point; I doubt whether\r\never boy longed for his holidays as much as I do to see you all again.\"\r\n\r\nTo his \"dear Henslow\" he writes: \"It is now some months since we have\r\nbeen at a civilized port; nearly all this time has been spent in the\r\nmost southern part of Tierra del Fuego.... The Fuegians are in a more\r\nmiserable state of barbarism than I had expected ever to have seen a\r\nhuman being. In this inclement country they are absolutely naked, and\r\ntheir temporary houses are like what children make in summer with boughs\r\nof trees.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitz-Roy, on a previous voyage, had carried several natives to\r\nEngland, and now brought them again to their own land. \"They had\r\nbecome,\" says Darwin, \"entirely European in their habits and wishes, so\r\nmuch so that the younger one had forgotten his own language, and their\r\ncountrymen paid but very little attention to them. We built houses for\r\nthem, and planted gardens, but by the time we return again on our\r\npassage round the Horn, I think it will be very doubtful how much of\r\ntheir property will be left unstolen.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Cape of Good Hope, Darwin met and dined with Sir John Herschel.\r\nFor some time he lived at St. Helena, \"within a stone's throw of\r\nNapoleon's tomb.\" He became so deeply interested in his geological\r\ninvestigations in South America, that he wrote his sister Susan: \"I\r\nliterally could hardly sleep at nights for thinking over my day's work.\r\nThe scenery was so new, and so majestic; everything at an elevation of\r\ntwelve thousand feet bears so different an aspect from that in a lower\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nTo another sister he wrote: \"I trust and believe that the time spent in\r\nthis voyage, if thrown away for all other respects, will produce its\r\nfull worth in Natural History; and it appears to me the doing what\r\n_little_ we can to increase the general stock of knowledge is as\r\nrespectable an object of life as one can in any likelihood pursue....\r\nWhat fine opportunities for geology and for studying the infinite host\r\nof living beings! Is not this a prospect to keep up the most flagging\r\nspirit? If I was to throw it away, I don't think I should ever rest\r\nquiet in my grave.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin says: \"As far as I can judge of myself, I worked to the utmost\r\nduring the voyage, from the mere pleasure of investigation, and from my\r\nstrong desire to add a few facts to the great mass of facts in natural\r\nscience. But I was also ambitious to take a fair place among scientific\r\nmen.\" In studying the geology of St. Jago, \"It then first dawned on me\r\nthat I might perhaps write a book on the geology of the various\r\ncountries visited, and this made me thrill with delight. That was a\r\nmemorable hour to me, and how distinctly I can call to mind the low\r\ncliff of lava beneath which I rested, with the sun glaring hot, a few\r\nstrange desert plants growing near, and with living corals in the tidal\r\npools at my feet. Later in the voyage, Fitz-Roy asked me to read some of\r\nmy journal, and declared it would be worth publishing, so here was a\r\nsecond book in prospect!\"\r\n\r\nDarwin, stirred by the right kind of ambition, had found his life-work.\r\nIt would not be in the church, as his father had fondly hoped, but the\r\nworld would be his audience.\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 1836, Darwin arrived at Shrewsbury, after five years'\r\nabsence. He left home a high-spirited, warm-hearted youth, fond of\r\nathletic sports, and vigorous in body. He came back with a passionate\r\nlove for science, \"with the habit of energetic industry and of\r\nconcentrated attention,\" but with health impaired, which made the whole\r\nof his after life a battle with suffering. Yet he conquered, and gave to\r\nhis generation a wonderful example of the power of mind over body; of\r\nvictory over obstacles.\r\n\r\nDuring the voyage he was an almost constant sufferer from sea-sickness.\r\nHe wrote home the last year: \"It is a lucky thing for me that the voyage\r\nis drawing to its close, for I positively suffer more from sea-sickness\r\nnow than three years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"After perhaps an hour's work,\" says Admiral Stokes, \"he would say to\r\nme, 'Old fellow, I must take the horizontal for it,' that being the\r\nbest relief position from ship motion. A stretch out on one side of the\r\ntable for some time would enable him to resume his labors for a while,\r\nwhen he had again to lie down. It was distressing to witness this early\r\nsacrifice of Mr. Darwin's health, who ever afterwards seriously felt the\r\nill effects of the Beagle's voyage.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Mellersh says: \"I think he was the only man I ever knew against\r\nwhom I never heard a word said; and as people, when shut up in a ship\r\nfor five years, are apt to get cross with each other, that is saying a\r\ngood deal.\" Says another: \"He was never known to be out of temper, or to\r\nsay one unkind or hasty word _of_ or _to_ any one.\"\r\n\r\nThis lovely spirit, which so endeared him to everybody, Darwin kept\r\nthrough life,--a spirit which sheds a halo around every book he wrote,\r\nand makes him worthy the admiration and honor of every young man. Many\r\npersons have the gift of writing books, but comparatively few persons\r\nhave the great gift of self-control.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief visit with his family, Darwin hastened to Cambridge, to\r\nprepare his \"Journal of Travels.\" He had learned on the Beagle that \"a\r\nman who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of\r\nlife.\" After three months of hard work, he went to London, where he\r\nfinished the \"Journal,\" and began working on his \"Zooelogy of the Voyage\r\nof the Beagle,\" and his \"Geological Observations.\" He said at this\r\ntime: \"I have nothing to wish for, excepting stronger health to go on\r\nwith the subjects to which I have joyfully determined to devote my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nFor three years and eight months he worked untiringly. He wrote Henslow:\r\n\"I fear the Geology will take me a great deal of time; I was looking\r\nover one set of notes, and the quantity I found I had to read for that\r\none place was frightful. If I live till I am eighty years old I shall\r\nnot cease to marvel at finding myself an author. In the summer before I\r\nstarted, if any one had told me that I should have been an angel by this\r\ntime, I should have thought it an equal impossibility. This marvellous\r\ntransformation is all owing to you.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin and Lyell now became very intimate friends. \"I am coming into\r\nyour way, of only working about two hours at a spell,\" he writes to\r\nLyell; \"I then go out and do my business in the streets, return and set\r\nto work again, and thus make two separate days out of one.\" Of Lyell he\r\nsaid: \"One of his chief characteristics was his sympathy with the work\r\nof others.... The science of geology is enormously indebted to\r\nLyell--more so, as I believe, than to any other man who ever lived.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Journal\" was published in 1839. January twenty-nine of this year,\r\nMr. Darwin, now thirty years of age, was married to his cousin, Emma\r\nWedgwood, daughter of Josiah Wedgwood of Maer, and granddaughter of the\r\nfounder of the potteries of Etruria. The extreme happiness of his\r\nmarried life proved the wisdom of his choice. He said in after years,\r\n\"No one can be too kind to my dear wife, who is worth her weight in gold\r\nmany times over.\"\r\n\r\nThey lived at No. 12 Upper Gower Street, as he wrote a college mate, \"a\r\nlife of extreme quietness.... We have given up all parties, for they\r\nagree with neither of us; and if one is quiet in London, there is\r\nnothing like its quietness.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1842, his \"Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs\" was published,\r\na book which cost him, he says, \"twenty months of hard work, as I had to\r\nread every work on the islands of the Pacific, and to consult many\r\ncharts.\" Of this book, Professor Geikie says: \"This well known treatise,\r\nthe most original of all its author's geological memoirs, has become one\r\nof the classics of geological literature. The origin of those remarkable\r\nrings of coral-rock in mid-ocean has given rise to much speculation, but\r\nno satisfactory solution of the problem has been proposed. After\r\nvisiting many of them, and examining also coral reefs that fringe\r\nislands and continents, he offered a theory which, for simplicity and\r\ngrandeur, strikes every reader with astonishment.... No more admirable\r\nexample of scientific method was ever given to the world, and, even if\r\nhe had written nothing else, this treatise alone would have placed\r\nDarwin in the very front of investigators of nature.\"\r\n\r\nLyell wrote to Darwin concerning this book: \"It is all true, but do not\r\nflatter yourself that you will be believed till you are growing bald,\r\nlike me, with hard work and vexation at the incredulity of the world.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin's next work, on the \"Volcanic Islands Visited during the Voyage\r\nof the Beagle,\" was published in 1844. This book, he said, \"cost me\r\neighteen months.\" His third geological book, \"Geological Observations on\r\nSouth America,\" was published in 1846.\r\n\r\nMeantime, tired of smoky London, Darwin purchased a home in Down, a\r\nretired village five or six hundred feet above the sea. The house was a\r\nsquare brick building, of three stories, vine-covered, in the midst of\r\neighteen acres. \"Its chief merit,\" Darwin writes to a friend, \"is its\r\nextreme rurality. I think I was never in a more perfectly quiet\r\ncountry.\" Here, for forty years, Darwin lived the isolated life of a\r\nstudent, producing the books that made him the most noted scientist of\r\nhis century. Of these years, Mr. Darwin said: \"Few persons can have\r\nlived a more retired life than we have done. Besides short visits to the\r\nhouses of relations, and occasionally to the seaside or elsewhere, we\r\nhave gone nowhere. During the first part of our residence we went a\r\nlittle into society, and received a few friends here; but my health\r\nalmost always suffered from the excitement.... I have, therefore, been\r\ncompelled for many years to give up all dinner parties.... From the same\r\ncause I have been able to invite here very few scientific acquaintances.\r\nMy chief enjoyment and sole employment throughout life has been\r\nscientific work; and the excitement from such work makes me for the time\r\nforget, or drives quite away, my daily discomfort.\"\r\n\r\nAt Down, Darwin worked for eight years on two large volumes concerning\r\ncirripedia (barnacles), describing all the known living species; the\r\nextinct species, or fossil cirripedes, were in two smaller volumes. The\r\nfirst books were published by the Ray Society, between 1851 and 1854;\r\nthe others by the Palaeontographical Society. About two years out of the\r\neight were lost through illness. Sometimes he became half discouraged.\r\nHe wrote a friend, \"I have been so steadily going downhill, I cannot\r\nhelp doubting whether I can ever crawl a little uphill again. Unless I\r\ncan, enough to work a little, I hope my life may be very short, for to\r\nlie on a sofa all day and do nothing but give trouble to the best and\r\nkindest of wives and good, dear children is dreadful.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin doubted, in after life, \"whether the work was worth the\r\nconsumption of so much time,\" but Professor Huxley thinks he \"never did\r\na wiser thing than when he devoted himself to the years of patient toil\r\nwhich the cirriped-book cost him.... The value of the cirriped monograph\r\nlies not merely in the fact that it is a very admirable piece of work,\r\nand constituted a great addition to positive knowledge, but still more\r\nin the circumstance that it was a piece of critical self-discipline, the\r\neffect of which manifested itself in everything he wrote afterwards,\r\nand saved him from endless errors of detail.\" Darwin's patient labor is\r\nshown by his working \"for the last half-month, daily, in dissecting a\r\nlittle animal about the size of a pin's head, from the Chonos\r\narchipelago, and I could spend another month, and daily see more\r\nbeautiful structure.\"\r\n\r\nDuring these years from 1846 to 1854, death had twice disturbed the\r\nquiet life at Down. In 1849, Dr. Darwin died, and his son Charles was so\r\nill that he could not attend the funeral. In 1851, Annie Darwin died, at\r\nthe age of ten, after a brief illness. \"She was,\" said Darwin, \"my\r\nfavorite child; her cordiality, openness, buoyant joyousness, and strong\r\naffections made her most lovable.... When quite a baby, this [strong\r\naffection] showed itself in never being easy without touching her mother\r\nwhen in bed with her; and quite lately she would, when poorly, fondle\r\nfor any length of time one of her mother's arms.... She would at almost\r\nany time spend half an hour in arranging my hair, 'making it,' as she\r\ncalled it, 'beautiful,' or in smoothing, the poor, dear darling, my\r\ncollar or cuffs--in short, in fondling me.... Her whole mind was pure\r\nand transparent. One felt one knew her thoroughly and could trust her. I\r\nalways thought that, come what might, we should have had, in our old\r\nage, at least one loving soul which nothing could have changed.\r\n\r\n\"All her movements were vigorous, active, and usually graceful. When\r\ngoing round the Sandwalk with me, although I walked fast, yet she often\r\nused to go before, pirouetting in the most elegant way, her dear face\r\nbright all the time with the sweetest smiles. Occasionally she had a\r\npretty coquettish manner towards me, the memory of which is charming....\r\n\r\n\"In the last short illness her conduct, in simple truth, was angelic.\r\nShe never once complained; never became fretful; was ever considerate of\r\nothers, and was thankful in the most gentle, pathetic manner for\r\neverything done for her. When so exhausted that she could hardly speak,\r\nshe praised everything that was given her, and said some tea 'was\r\nbeautifully good.' When I gave her some water, she said, 'I quite thank\r\nyou;' and these, I believe, were the last precious words ever addressed\r\nby her dear lips to me.\"\r\n\r\nSuch consideration and politeness she naturally inherited. Francis\r\nDarwin says in his delightful life of his father, \"He always spoke to\r\nservants with politeness, using the expression, 'Would you be so good,'\r\nin asking for anything. In business matters he was equally courteous.\r\nHis solicitor, who had never met him, said, 'Everything I did was right,\r\nand everything was profusely thanked for.'\" Of the drawings made by his\r\nchildren, he would say, \"Michael Angelo is nothing to it!\" but he always\r\nlooked carefully at the work and kindly pointed out mistakes.\r\n\r\n\"He received,\" says his son, \"many letters from foolish, unscrupulous\r\npeople, and all of these received replies. He used to say that if he\r\ndid not answer them, he had it on his conscience afterwards, and, no\r\ndoubt, it was in great measure the courtesy with which he answered every\r\none which produced the universal and widespread sense of his kindness of\r\nnature which was so evident on his death.\"\r\n\r\nIn November, 1853, Darwin received the Royal Society's Medal. He was\r\ngratified, finding it \"a pleasant little stimulus. When work goes badly,\r\nand one ruminates that all is vanity, it is pleasant to have some\r\ntangible proof that others have thought something of one's labors.\"\r\n\r\nNovember 24, 1859, when Darwin was fifty, his great work, \"Origin of\r\nSpecies by means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favored\r\nRaces in the Struggle for Life,\" was published. For twenty years he had\r\nbeen making experiments with plants and animals, and filling his\r\nnote-books with facts. To his old classmate, Fox, he writes asking that\r\nthe boys in his school gather lizards' eggs, as well as those of snakes.\r\n\"My object is,\" he says, \"to see whether such eggs will float on\r\nsea-water, and whether they will keep alive thus floating for a month or\r\ntwo in my cellar. I am trying experiments on transportation of all\r\norganic beings that I can; and lizards are found on every island, and\r\ntherefore I am very anxious to see whether their eggs stand sea-water.\"\r\nAgain he writes, asking Fox for ducklings and dorkings; \"The chief point\r\nwhich I am and have been for years very curious about is to ascertain\r\nwhether the _young_ of our domestic breeds differ as much from each\r\nother as do their parents, and I have no faith in anything short of\r\nactual measurement and the Rule of Three.... I have got my fan-tails and\r\npouters in a grand cage and pigeon-house, and they are a decided\r\namusement to me, and delight to H.\"\r\n\r\nOf this book, Darwin himself says: \"I worked on true Baconian\r\nprinciples, and without any theory--collected facts on a wholesale\r\nscale, more especially with respect to domesticated productions, by\r\nprinted inquiries, by conversation with skilful breeders and gardeners,\r\nand by extensive reading. When I see the list of books of all kinds\r\nwhich I read and abstracted, including whole series of Journals and\r\nTransactions, I am surprised at my industry. I soon perceived that\r\nselection was the keystone of man's success in making useful races of\r\nanimals and plants....\r\n\r\n\"In October, 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my\r\nsystematic inquiry, I happened to read 'Malthus on Population,' and,\r\nbeing well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which\r\neverywhere goes on, from long continued observation of the habits of\r\nanimals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances\r\nfavorable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavorable ones to\r\nbe destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new\r\nspecies.... But at that time I overlooked one problem of great\r\nimportance.... This problem is the tendency in organic beings descended\r\nfrom the same stock to diverge in character as they become modified.\r\nThat they have diverged greatly is obvious from the manner in which\r\nspecies of all kinds can be classed under genera, genera under families,\r\nfamilies under sub-orders, and so forth.... The solution, as I believe,\r\nis that the modified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend\r\nto become adapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy\r\nof nature.\"\r\n\r\nThe book was written slowly, each chapter requiring at least three\r\nmonths. When the \"Origin of Species\"--which had reached its thirty-third\r\nthousand in 1888--was published, it created the most profound sensation\r\nthroughout the thinking world. Heretofore, most men of science had\r\nbelieved that each species had been separately created by the\r\nAlmighty,--that species were immutable, unchanging.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, by twenty years of study, proved to his own mind, and now to\r\nmost of the world, that there has been a gradual evolution, through\r\nunnumbered ages, of one form of animal life from another. He said,\r\n\"Probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on the earth have\r\ndescended from some one primordial form, into which life was first\r\nbreathed.\"\r\n\r\nThe theory of evolution was not original with Darwin. Lamarck, in 1801,\r\npublished his \"Organization of Living Bodies,\" in which he stated his\r\nbelief \"that nature, in all the long ages during which the world has\r\nexisted, may have produced the different kinds of plants and animals by\r\ngradually enlarging one part and diminishing another to suit the wants\r\nof each.\" Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire, Goethe, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, the\r\ngrandfather of Charles, all believed that species are descended from\r\nother species, and in various ways improved.\r\n\r\nSome of the reasons for the belief in evolution are so simply and\r\nclearly stated by Arabella B. Buckley, in her \"Short History of Natural\r\nScience,\" that I quote her words:--\r\n\r\n\"_All the Animals of each class are formed on the same plan_....\r\n\r\n\"Why should the animals of one class (such as the vertebrate or\r\nback-boned class) be formed all on one plan, even to the most minute\r\nbones; so that the wing of a bat, the front leg of a horse, the hand of\r\na man, and the flapper of a porpoise, are all made of the same bones,\r\nwhich have either grown together, or lengthened and spread apart,\r\naccording to the purpose they serve? And, more curious still, why should\r\nsome animals have parts which are of no use to them, but only seem to be\r\nthere because other animals of the same class also have them? Thus the\r\nwhale has teeth like the other mammalia, but they never pierce through\r\nthe gum; and the boa-constrictor has the beginnings of hind legs, hidden\r\nunder its skin, though they never grow out. Here, again, it seems\r\nextraordinary, if a boa-constrictor and a whale were created\r\nseparately, that they should be made with organs which are quite\r\nuseless; while, on the other hand, if they were descended from the same\r\nancestor, as other reptiles and mammalia who have teeth and hind legs,\r\nthey might be supposed to have inherited these organs....\r\n\r\n\"_Embryos of animals alike in Structure._\r\n\r\n\"Another still more remarkable fact was that pointed out by Von Baer,\r\nthat the higher animals, such as quadrupeds, before they are perfectly\r\nformed, cannot be distinguished from the embryos of other and lower\r\nanimals, such as fish and reptiles. If animals were created separately,\r\nwhy should a dog begin like a fish, a lizard, and a bird, and have at\r\nfirst parts which it loses as it grows into its own peculiar form?\r\n\r\n\"_Living animals of a country agree with the fossil ones_....\r\n\r\n\"We know that certain animals are only found in particular countries;\r\nkangaroos and pouched animals, for example, in Australia, and sloths and\r\narmadillos in South America. Now, it is remarkable that all the fossil\r\nquadrupeds in Australia are also pouched animals, though they are of\r\ndifferent kinds and larger in size than those now living; and in the\r\nsame way different species of sloth and armadillos are found fossil in\r\nSouth America; while in the rocks of Europe fossil mammalia are found,\r\nonly slightly different from those which are living there now.\" It seems\r\nnatural to conclude that the living have descended from the fossils.\r\n\r\nThe study of the rocks has produced other \"missing links\" in the\r\nsuccession of animal life. Professor Huxley, in some lectures given in\r\nNew York in 1876, described the Hesperornis, found in the western\r\nrocks,--a huge bird, five or six feet in length, with teeth like a\r\nreptile. In England a fossil reptile has been found, the Archaeopteryx,\r\nhaving a reptile-like tail, with a fringe of feathers on each side, and\r\nteeth, \"occupying a midway place between a bird and a reptile.\" Flying\r\nreptiles have been found, and reptiles which walked on their hind legs.\r\nThose who have visited Yale and Amherst Colleges must have seen the huge\r\nbird-tracks or reptile foot-prints taken from the rocks in the\r\nConnecticut valley.\r\n\r\nProfessor Huxley showed the probable descent of the horse with its\r\nhoofed foot from the extinct three-toed Hipparion of Europe, and that\r\nfrom the four-toed Orohippus of the Eocene formation. He declared it\r\nprobable that a five-toed horse would be found, and Professor Marsh, in\r\nthe West, has found the Eohippus, corresponding very nearly to Professor\r\nHuxley's description.\r\n\r\nThe question among naturalists was, \"How can plants and animals have\r\nbecome thus changed?\" Darwin showed how it was possible to effect most\r\nof these changes by \"natural selection,\" or the choosing of the best to\r\nsurvive in the struggle for existence. As man by grafting secures the\r\nfinest fruit, and by care in animal life the swiftest horses for speed\r\nas well as the strongest for labor, so nature selects her best for the\r\nhigher development of the race.\r\n\r\nDarwin says, \"There is no exception to the rule that every organic being\r\nnaturally increases at so high a rate that, if not destroyed, the earth\r\nwould soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even\r\nslow-breeding man has doubled in twenty-five years, and, at this rate,\r\nin less than a thousand years there would literally not be standing-room\r\nfor his progeny.... The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder of all\r\nknown animals; it will be safest to assume that it begins breeding when\r\nthirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing\r\nforth six young in the interval, and surviving till one hundred years\r\nold; if this be so, after a period of from 740 to 750 years, there would\r\nbe nearly nineteen million elephants alive, descended from the first\r\npair.\"\r\n\r\nIn various ways the weakest are destroyed. Darwin, on a piece of ground\r\nthree feet long and two wide, says, \"I marked all the seedlings of our\r\nnative weeds as they came up, and, out of 357, no less than 295 were\r\ndestroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects.\"\r\n\r\nHe gives this interesting instance of the struggle for existence. \"I\r\nfind from experiments that humble-bees are almost indispensable to the\r\nfertilization of the heart's-ease, for other bees do not visit this\r\nflower.... Humble-bees alone visit red clover, as other bees cannot\r\nreach the nectar.... Hence we may infer as highly probable that, if the\r\nwhole genus of humble-bees became extinct or very rare in England, the\r\nheart's-ease and red clover would become very rare, or wholly disappear.\r\nThe number of humble-bees in any district depends in a great measure\r\nupon the number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; the\r\nnumber of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on the number\r\nof cats.\" Hence, as Mr. Darwin shows, the frequency of certain flowers\r\nin a district may depend upon the number of cats!\r\n\r\nDarwin showed, by most interesting experiments with pigeons, that the\r\nvarious breeds come from the wild rock-pigeon; that dogs are descended,\r\nprobably, from the wolf; that different varieties can be produced and\r\nperpetuated under changing conditions of life; that species are only\r\nwell marked and permanent varieties. He showed how organs can be changed\r\nby use or disuse; such as, the erect ears of wild animals become\r\ndrooping under domestication; or moles have only rudimentary eyes,\r\ncovered with skin or fur, because not needed for sight.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Origin of Species,\" the theory of evolution received proof which\r\nwas so nearly incontrovertible that the subject was brought prominently\r\nbefore the world as never before. Mr. Alfred Russell Wallace, an able\r\nscientist, came to the same conclusion as Darwin in regard to the power\r\nof \"Natural Selection,\" and published, at the same time as the\r\n\"Origin,\" an essay \"On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely\r\nfrom the Original Type.\"\r\n\r\nAt once Darwin was attacked from every quarter. Probably not since\r\nGalileo showed that the earth moves round the sun has a man been so\r\ncensured and persecuted for his opinions as was Darwin. He was declared\r\natheistic, unsettling the Christian belief, and opposed to the teachings\r\nof the Bible. Professor Asa Gray of Cambridge, Mass., a devoted\r\nChristian and able scientist, defended and explained Darwin's views, now\r\npublished in \"Darwiniana,\" claiming that the doctrine of evolution is in\r\nno wise opposed to the power and goodness of the Almighty, and quotes\r\nCharles Kingsley's words: \"We know of old that God was so wise that he\r\ncould make all things; but behold, he is so much wiser than even that,\r\nthat he can make all things make themselves.\" Kingsley wrote Darwin: \"I\r\nhave gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble a conception of\r\nDeity to believe that he created primal forms capable of\r\nself-development into all forms needful _pro tempore_ and _pro loco_, as\r\nto believe that he required a fresh act of intervention to supply the\r\n_lacunas_ which he himself had made. I question whether the former be\r\nnot the loftier thought.\" Gray believed that \"to do any work by an\r\ninstrument must require, and therefore presuppose, the exertion rather\r\nof more than of less power than to do it directly.\" Darwin said, \"There\r\nis grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been\r\noriginally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and\r\nthat, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law\r\nof gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms, most beautiful and\r\nmost wonderful, have been and are being evolved.\" Darwin always felt\r\ngrateful to Asa Gray for his defence. He wrote him: \"I declare that you\r\nknow my book as well as I do myself; and bring to the question new lines\r\nof illustration and argument, in a manner which excites my astonishment\r\nand almost my envy!... I said, in a former letter, that you were a\r\nlawyer, but I made a gross mistake; I am sure that you are a poet. No, I\r\nwill tell you what you are, a hybrid, a complex cross of lawyer, poet,\r\nnaturalist, and theologian!\"\r\n\r\nDarwin wisely made no reply to his critics. He said, years later: \"My\r\nviews have often been grossly misrepresented, bitterly opposed and\r\nridiculed, but this has been generally done, as I believe, in good\r\nfaith. On the whole, I do not doubt that my works have been over and\r\nover again greatly overpraised. I rejoice that I have avoided\r\ncontroversies, and this I owe to Lyell, who, many years ago, in\r\nreference to my geological works, strongly advised me never to get\r\nentangled in a controversy, as it rarely did any good, and caused a\r\nmiserable loss of time and temper.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever I have found out that I have blundered, or that my work has\r\nbeen imperfect, and when I have been contemptuously criticised, and\r\neven when I have been overpraised, so that I have felt mortified, it has\r\nbeen my greatest comfort to say hundreds of times to myself, 'that I\r\nhave worked as hard and as well as I could, and no man can do more than\r\nthis.'\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Origin\" has been translated into French, German, Italian, Dutch,\r\nRussian, Swedish, and many other languages. Huxley says of it, \"Even a\r\ncursory glance at the history of the biological sciences during the last\r\nquarter of a century is sufficient to justify the assertion that the\r\nmost potent instrument for the extension of the realm of natural\r\nknowledge which has come into men's hands since the publication of\r\nNewton's 'Principia' is Darwin's 'Origin of Species.'\"\r\n\r\nThe year after the \"Origin\" was published, Darwin began arranging his\r\nnotes for his two large volumes, \"Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication,\" which, however, were not published till 1868. On these\r\ntwo books he spent over four years. They are a wonderful collection of\r\nfacts, gathered from books and from his own marvellous experiments and\r\nobservations, confirming and illustrating the law of \"Natural Selection\"\r\ngiven in the \"Origin.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin had already received the Copley medal of the Royal Society, the\r\ngreatest honor a scientific man can receive in England, and the Prussian\r\nOrder \"Pour le Merite,\" founded by Frederick II. The order consists of\r\nthirty German members and a few distinguished foreigners. In 1862 the\r\n\"Fertilization of Orchids\" was published, which, required ten months of\r\nlabor. In this work Darwin took the utmost delight. He wrote to a friend\r\nwho had sent him some of these flowers: \"It is impossible to thank you\r\nenough. I was almost mad at the wealth of Orchids.... I never was more\r\ninterested in any subject in my life than in this of Orchids.\" The\r\npeculiarities of the flowers therein described, as Darwin says,\r\n\"transcend in an incomparable manner the contrivances and adaptations\r\nwhich the most fertile imagination of man could invent.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Origin\" he describes an orchid which \"has part of its labellum\r\nor lower lip hollowed out into a great bucket, into which drops of\r\nalmost pure water continually fall from two secreting horns which stand\r\nabove it; and when the bucket is half full the water overflows by a\r\nspout on one side. The basal part of the labellum stands over the\r\nbucket, and is itself hollowed out into a sort of chamber with two\r\nlateral entrances; within this chamber there are curious fleshy ridges.\r\nThe most ingenious man, if he had not witnessed what takes place, could\r\nnever have imagined what purpose all these parts serve. But Dr. Crueger\r\nsaw crowds of large humble-bees visiting the gigantic flowers of this\r\norchid, not in order to suck nectar, but to gnaw off the ridges within\r\nthe chamber above the bucket; in doing this they frequently pushed each\r\nother into the bucket, and, their wings being thus wetted, they could\r\nnot fly away, but were compelled to crawl out through the passage formed\r\nby the spout or overflow.... The passage is narrow, and is roofed over\r\nby the column, so that a bee, in forcing its way out, first rubs its\r\nback against the viscid stigma and then against the viscid glands of the\r\npollen-masses. The pollen-masses are thus glued to the back of the bee\r\nwhich first happens to crawl out through the passage of a lately\r\nexpanded flower, and are thus carried away....\r\n\r\n\"When the bee, thus provided, flies to another flower, or to the same\r\nflower a second time, and is pushed by its comrades into the bucket and\r\nthen crawls out by the passage, the pollen-mass necessarily comes first\r\ninto contact with the viscid stigma, and adheres to it, and the flower\r\nis fertilized. Now at last we see the full use of every part of the\r\nflower; of the water-secreting horns, of the bucket half full of water,\r\nwhich prevents the bees from flying away, and forces them to crawl out\r\nthrough the spout, and rub against the properly placed viscid\r\npollen-masses and the viscid stigma.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin said: \"The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies.... There\r\nis a superb, but, I fear, exaggerated, review in the 'London Review.'\r\nBut I have not been a fool, as I thought I was, to publish; for Asa\r\nGray, about the most competent judge in the world, thinks almost as\r\nhighly of the book as does the 'London Review.'\"\r\n\r\nDarwin wrote several other books on plants. \"The Movements and Habits of\r\nClimbing Plants\" was published in 1875; \"Insectivorous Plants,\" in\r\n1875; \"Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilization,\" in 1876; \"The different\r\nForms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species,\" in 1877; \"The Power of\r\nMovement in Plants,\" in 1880.\r\n\r\nWhen writing his \"Different Forms of Flowers,\" he said, \"I am all on\r\nfire at the work;\" and of \"Insectivorous Plants,\" \"I have been working\r\nlike a madman at Drosera. Here is a fact for you which is certain as you\r\nstand where you are, though you won't believe it, that a bit of hair,\r\n1/78000 of one grain in weight, placed on gland, will cause _one_ of the\r\ngland-bearing hairs of Drosera to curve inwards, and will alter the\r\ncondition of the content of every cell in the foot-stalk of the gland.\"\r\n\r\nBut he was growing tired with his constant and multifarious labors. He\r\nwrote to Hooker: \"You ask about my book, and all that I can say is that\r\nI am ready to commit suicide; I thought it was decently written, but\r\nfind so much wants rewriting that it will not be ready to go to printers\r\nfor two months, and will then make a confoundedly big book. Murray will\r\nsay that it is no use publishing in the middle of summer, so I do not\r\nknow what will be the upshot; but I begin to think that every one who\r\npublishes a book is a fool.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1871 the \"Descent of Man\" was published. He worked on this book three\r\nyears, and he wrote to his friend, Sir J. D. Hooker, that it has \"half\r\nkilled\" him. For the first edition Darwin received over seven thousand\r\ndollars. It had an immense circulation in England and America, and\r\ncreated a furor in Germany.\r\n\r\nDarwin believed \"that man is descended from a hairy quadruped, furnished\r\nwith a tail and pointed ears, probably arboreal in its habits, and an\r\ninhabitant of the Old World. This creature, if its whole structure had\r\nbeen examined by a naturalist, would have been classed among the\r\nquadrumana, as surely as would the common and still more ancient\r\nprogenitor of the Old and New World monkeys.\r\n\r\n\"The quadrumana and all the higher mammals are probably derived from an\r\nancient marsupial animal, and this, through a long line of diversified\r\nforms, either from some reptile-like or some amphibian-like creature,\r\nand this again from some fishlike animal. In the dim obscurity of the\r\npast, we can see that the early progenitor of all the vertebrata must\r\nhave been an aquatic animal, provided with branchiae, with the two sexes\r\nunited in the same individual, and with the most important organs of the\r\nbody (such as the brain and heart) imperfectly developed. This animal\r\nseems to have been more like the larvae of our existing marine Ascidians\r\nthan any known form.\"\r\n\r\nMost naturalists believe, with Darwin, that man has developed from some\r\nlower form, but many urge that at some stage of development he received\r\nthe gift of speech, and mental and moral powers, from an omnipotent\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\nDarwin received much abuse and much ridicule for his views. Mr. James D.\r\nHague tells in \"Harper's Magazine\" of a visit paid to the great\r\nscientist, when a picture in the \"Hornet\" was shown; the body of a\r\ngorilla, with the head of Darwin. The latter laughed and said, \"The head\r\nis cleverly done, but the gorilla is bad; too much chest; it couldn't be\r\nlike that.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Descent of Man\" shows the widest research, and is a storehouse of\r\nmost interesting facts. \"Sexual Selection\" shows some of the most\r\nremarkable provisions of nature, and is as interesting as any novel.\r\nThis book, like the \"Origin,\" has been translated into various\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 \"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals\" was\r\npublished. Over five thousand copies were sold on the day of\r\npublication. It was begun at the birth of his first child, thirty-three\r\nyears before. He says, \"I at once commenced to make notes on the first\r\ndawn of the various expressions which he exhibited, for I felt\r\nconvinced, even at this early period, that the most complex and fine\r\nshades of expression must all have had a gradual and natural origin.\" He\r\nwrote to a college friend regarding this baby: \"He is so charming that I\r\ncannot pretend to any modesty. I defy anybody to flatter us on our baby,\r\nfor I defy any one to say anything in its praise of which we are not\r\nfully conscious.... I had not the smallest conception there was so much\r\nin a five-mouth baby. You will perceive by this that I have a fine\r\ndegree of paternal fervor.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1881, \"The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Action of Worms,\r\nwith Observations on their Habits,\" was published. \"Fragments of burnt\r\nmarl, cinders, etc., which had been thickly strewed over the surface of\r\nseveral meadows were found, after a few years, lying at a depth of some\r\ninches beneath the turf, but still forming a layer.\" Ascertaining that\r\nthis was the work of worms, Darwin made a study of their structure,\r\nhabits, and work, in his garden, his fields, and in pots of earth kept\r\nin his study. The intelligence of worms, the construction of their\r\nburrows, and the amount of labor they can perform, are described in a\r\nmost entertaining manner. Over fifty thousand worms are found in a\r\nsingle acre of land, or about three hundred and fifty-six pounds. \"In\r\nmany parts of England a weight of more than ten tons of dry earth\r\nannually passes through their bodies, and is brought to the surface, on\r\neach acre of land.... Worms prepare the ground in an excellent manner\r\nfor the growth of fibrous-rooted plants and for seedlings of all kinds.\r\nThey periodically expose the mould to the air, and sift it so that no\r\nstones larger than the particles which they can swallow are left in it.\r\nThey mingle the whole intimately together, like a gardener who prepares\r\nfine soil for his choicest plants.... The plough is one of the most\r\nancient and most valuable of man's inventions; but long before he\r\nexisted the land was in fact regularly ploughed, and still continues to\r\nbe thus ploughed, by earthworms. It may be doubted whether there are\r\nmany other animals which have played so important a part in the history\r\nof the world as have these lowly organized creatures.\"\r\n\r\nIn three years eighty-five hundred copies of the \"Earthworms\" were sold.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin was now seventy-two years old. Already many honors had come\r\nto him, after the severe and bitter censure. In 1877, he received the\r\ndegree of LL.D. from Cambridge University. In 1878, he was elected a\r\ncorresponding member of the French Institute, and of the Berlin Academy\r\nof Sciences. In 1879, he received the Baly Medal of the Royal College of\r\nPhysicians. In 1879, from the Royal Academy of Turin, the _Bressa_ Prize\r\nof twelve thousand francs. He valued highly two photographic albums sent\r\nfrom Germany and Holland; one containing the pictures of one hundred and\r\nfifty-four noted scientific men; the other, of two hundred and seventeen\r\nlovers of natural science in the Netherlands. He wrote in thanks: \"I am\r\nwell aware that my books could never have been written, and would not\r\nhave made any impression on the public mind, had not an immense amount\r\nof material been collected by a long series of admirable observers; and\r\nit is to them that honor is chiefly due. I suppose that every worker at\r\nscience occasionally feels depressed, and doubts whether what he has\r\npublished has been worth the labor which it has cost him, but for the\r\nfew remaining years of my life, whenever I want cheering, I will look at\r\nthe portraits of my distinguished co-workers in the field of science,\r\nand remember their generous sympathy.\"\r\n\r\nHe was made a member of more than seventy of the learned societies of\r\nthe world; in America, Austria, India, Belgium, Denmark, France,\r\nGermany, Holland, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,\r\nand elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDarwin's work was now almost over. His dear friend Lyell had gone before\r\nhim, of whom he said, \"I never forget that almost everything which I\r\nhave done in science I owe to the study of his great works.\" His brother\r\nErasmus, to whom he was tenderly attached, died in 1881. In the spring\r\nof 1882 he was unable to work continuously as usual, and suffered from\r\npain about the heart. On the night of April 18, he had a severe attack\r\nand fainted. When he was restored to consciousness, he said, \"I am not\r\nthe least afraid to die.\" He died the next day, April 19.\r\n\r\nDarwin died as he had lived, with a heart overflowing with sympathy and\r\ntenderness. He said, \"I feel no remorse from having committed any great\r\nsin, but have often and often regretted that I have not done more direct\r\ngood to my fellow-creatures.\"\r\n\r\nIn his home life he was singularly blest. His son says, \"No one except\r\nmy mother knows the full amount of suffering he endured, or the full\r\namount of his wonderful patience. For all the latter years of his life\r\nshe never left him for a night; and her days were so planned that all\r\nhis resting hours might be shared with her. She shielded him from every\r\navoidable annoyance, and omitted nothing that might save him trouble, or\r\nprevent him becoming overtired, or that might alleviate the many\r\ndiscomforts of his ill-health. I hesitate to speak thus freely of a\r\nthing so sacred as the life-long devotion which prompted all this\r\nconstant and tender care. But it is ... a principal feature of his life\r\nthat for nearly forty years he never knew one day of the health of\r\nordinary men, and that thus his life was one long struggle against the\r\nweariness and strain of sickness.\" And yet he accomplished all his\r\nwonderful work!\r\n\r\n\"In his relationship towards my mother, his tender and sympathetic\r\nnature was shown in its most beautiful aspect. In her presence he found\r\nhis happiness, and through her his life--which might have been\r\novershadowed by gloom--became one of content and quiet gladness.\"\r\n\r\nHe was the idol of his children, who used \"to bribe him with sixpence to\r\ncome and play in working hours.\" \"We all knew the sacredness of working\r\ntime,\" says Mr. Darwin's daughter, \"but that any one should resist\r\nsixpence seemed an impossibility.... Another mark of his unbounded\r\npatience was the way in which we were suffered to make raids into the\r\nstudy when we had an absolute need of sticking-plaster, string, pins,\r\nscissors, stamps, foot-rule, or hammer. These and other such\r\nnecessaries were always to be found in the study, and it was the only\r\nplace where this was a certainty. We used to feel it wrong to go in\r\nduring work-time; still, when the necessity was great we did so. I\r\nremember his patient look when he said once, 'Don't you think you could\r\nnot come in again; I have been interrupted very often?'... He cared for\r\nall our pursuits and interests, and lived our lives with us in a way\r\nthat very few fathers do.\"\r\n\r\nHis son says: \"The way he brought us up is shown by a little story about\r\nmy brother Leonard, which my father was fond of telling. He came into\r\nthe drawing-room, and found Leonard dancing about on the sofa, which was\r\nforbidden, for the sake of the springs, and said, 'Oh, Lenny, Lenny,\r\nthat's against all rules!' and received for answer, 'Then, I think you'd\r\nbetter go out of the room.' I do not believe he ever spoke an angry word\r\nto any of his children in his life; but I am certain that it never\r\nentered our heads to disobey him.... How often, when a man, I have\r\nwished, when my father was behind my chair, that he would pass his hand\r\nover my hair, as he used to do when I was a boy. He allowed his grown-up\r\nchildren to laugh with and at him, and was, generally speaking, on terms\r\nof perfect equality with us.\"\r\n\r\nHe was very fond of flowers, and also of dogs. When he had been absent\r\nfrom home, on his return his white fox-terrier, Polly, \"would get wild\r\nwith excitement, panting, squeaking, rushing round the room, and\r\njumping on and off the chairs; and he used to stoop down, pressing her\r\nface to his, letting her lick him, and speaking to her with a peculiarly\r\ntender, caressing voice.\"\r\n\r\nHe was very tender-hearted. A friend who often visited at Down told me\r\nthat Mrs. Darwin one day urged her husband to punish the little dog for\r\nsome wrong-doing. He took the animal tenderly in his arms and carried\r\nher out-of-doors, patting her gently on the head. \"Why, Charles,\"\r\nremonstrated the wife, \"she did not feel it.\" He replied, \"I could do no\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"The remembrance of screams or other sounds heard in Brazil,\" says\r\nFrancis Darwin, \"when he was powerless to interfere with what he\r\nbelieved to be the torture of a slave, haunted him for years, especially\r\nat night. In smaller matters, when he could interfere, he did so\r\nvigorously. He returned one day from his walk pale and faint from having\r\nseen a horse ill-used, and from the agitation of violently remonstrating\r\nwith the man. On another occasion he saw a horse-breaker teaching his\r\nson to ride. The little boy was frightened, and the man was rough. My\r\nfather stopped, and, jumping out of the carriage, reproved the man in no\r\nmeasured terms....\r\n\r\n\"A visitor, driving from Orpington to Down, told the man to go faster.\r\n'Why,' said the driver, 'if I had whipped the horse _this_ much driving\r\nMr. Darwin, he would have got out of the carriage and abused me well.'\"\r\n\r\nHis manner was bright and animated, and his face glowed in conversation.\r\nHe enjoyed fun, had a merry, ringing laugh, and a happy way of turning\r\nthings. He said once, \"Gray (Asa Gray of Harvard College) often takes me\r\nto task for making hasty generalizations; but the last time he was here\r\ntalking that way, I said to him, 'Now, Gray, I have one more\r\ngeneralization to make, which is not hasty; and that is, the Americans\r\nare the most delightful people I know.'\"\r\n\r\n\"He was particularly charming when 'chaffing' any one,\" says his son,\r\n\"and in high spirits over it. His manner at such times was light-hearted\r\nand boyish, and his refinement of nature came out most strongly. So,\r\nwhen he was talking to a lady who pleased and amused him, the\r\ncombination of raillery and deference in his manner was delightful to\r\nsee. When my father had several guests, he managed them well, getting a\r\ntalk with each, or bringing two or three together round his chair....\r\n\r\n\"My father much enjoyed wandering slowly in the garden with my mother or\r\nsome of his children, or making one of a party sitting out on a bench on\r\nthe lawn; he generally sat, however, on the grass, and I remember him\r\noften lying under one of the big lime-trees, with his head on the green\r\nmound at its foot.\"\r\n\r\nHe had great perseverance in his work, and used often to say, \"It's\r\ndogged as does it;\" and \"Saving the minutes is the way to get work\r\ndone.\" It was his habit to rise early in the morning, and after\r\nbreakfast work from eight to half-past nine, and then read his letters.\r\nAt ten or half-past, he went back to his work till twelve. After\r\nexercise in the \"Sandwalk,\" a narrow strip of land, one and a half acres\r\nin extent, with a gravel walk round it, planted with a variety of trees,\r\nin which he watched the birds and squirrels, he lunched and read his\r\nnewspaper. After this he wrote letters, and about three o'clock rested\r\nfor a time on the sofa, some of his family reading to him, often a\r\nnovel,--the work of Walter Scott, George Eliot, Miss Austen, or others.\r\nAt four he walked again, worked from half-past four till half-past five,\r\ndined, and usually spent his evenings, after a game of backgammon with\r\nhis wife, or hearing her play on the piano, in reading scientific books.\r\nConversation in the evening usually spoiled his rest for the night, but\r\nhe could do a great amount of work if he kept to his regular routine. In\r\neach book, as he read it, he marked passages bearing on his work. In\r\nreading a book or pamphlet, he made pencil lines at the side of the\r\npage, often adding short remarks, and at the end made a list of the\r\npages marked.\r\n\r\nDarwin said of himself: \"At no time am I a quick thinker or writer;\r\nwhatever I have done in science has solely been by long pondering,\r\npatience, and industry.... I think that I am superior to the common run\r\nof men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and in\r\nobserving them carefully. My industry has been nearly as great as it\r\ncould have been in the observation and collection of facts. What is far\r\nmore important, my love of natural science has been steady and ardent.\r\n\r\n\"This pure love has, however, been much aided by the ambition to be\r\nesteemed by my fellow-naturalists. From my early youth I have had the\r\nstrongest desire to understand or explain whatever I observed; that is,\r\nto group all facts under some general laws.... My habits are methodical,\r\nand this has been of not a little use for my particular line of work.\r\nLastly, I have had ample leisure from not having to earn my own bread.\r\nEven ill-health, though it has annihilated several years of my life, has\r\nsaved me from the distractions of society and amusement.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin was never egotistical, or elated by his great success. He\r\nalways felt and spoke modestly of his work. In the village people of\r\nDown he took a cordial interest, helping to found a Friendly Club, which\r\nhe served as treasurer for thirty years. He also acted for some years as\r\na county magistrate. The Vicar of Down, Rev. J. Brodie Innes, and Mr.\r\nDarwin were firm friends for thirty years, yet, says Darwin, \"we never\r\nthoroughly agreed on any subject but once, and then we stared hard at\r\neach other, and thought one of us must be very ill.\"\r\n\r\nIn the hall of the great Natural History Museum in London, a statue of\r\nDarwin was placed June 9, 1885, with appropriate addresses.\r\n\r\nDarwin's life is a most interesting study. That a boy who seemed in\r\nyouth to have no special fondness for books, but an especial delight in\r\ncollecting beetles; who appeared unfitted either for medicine or the\r\nchurch, should come to such a renowned manhood, is remarkable. His\r\nperseverance, his industry, his thought, his gentleness, his sunny\r\nnature in the midst of suffering, are delightful to contemplate. His\r\nbooks will be an enduring monument. He combined a great intellect and a\r\ngreat heart, which makes the most attractive nature, in either man or\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS TREVELYAN BUCKLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of those whose lives are sketched in this volume lived to be old\r\nmen; but Frank Buckland, the pet and pride of thousands in England, died\r\nin his prime, almost at the beginning of his fame; a man of whose life\r\nour \"Popular Science Monthly\" says, \"None more active, varied, and\r\nuseful is recorded in scientific biography.\"\r\n\r\nHe was the oldest son of the Dean of Westminster, Dr. William Buckland,\r\nand was born December 17, 1826, at Christ Church, Oxford, of which\r\ncathedral his father was canon at that time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCIS TREVELYAN BUCKLAND.]\r\n\r\n\"I was told,\" says Frank, in later years, \"that, soon after my birth, my\r\nfather and my godfather, the late Sir Francis Chantry, weighed me in the\r\nkitchen scales against a leg of mutton, and that I was heavier than the\r\njoint provided for the family dinner that day. In honor of my arrival,\r\nmy father and Sir Francis went into the garden and planted a birch tree.\r\nI know the taste of the twigs of that birch tree well. Sir Francis\r\nChantry offered to give me a library. 'What is the use of a library to a\r\nchild an hour old?' said my father. 'He will live to be sorry for that\r\nanswer,' said Sir Francis. I never got the library.\r\n\r\n\"One of my earliest offences in life was eating the end of a carriage\r\ncandle. For this, the birch rod not being handy, my father put me into a\r\nfurze bush, and therein I did penance for ten minutes. A furze bush does\r\nnot make a pleasant lounge when only very thin summer garments are\r\nworn.\"\r\n\r\nThe father, Dean Buckland, was distinguished as a man of letters, and\r\nfor his geological research. The mother, as is often the case with sons\r\nof genius, was a remarkable woman, who idolized her boy, and who\r\nreceived in return an affection unusual in its intimacy and confidence.\r\n\r\nShe began to write about him early, in her journal. \"At two and a half\r\nyears of age,\" she says, \"he never forgets either pictures or people he\r\nhas seen. Four months ago, as well as now, he would have gone through\r\nall the natural history books in the Radcliffe Library, without making\r\none error in miscalling a parrot, a duck, a kingfisher, an owl, or a\r\nvulture.\"\r\n\r\nOn taking him to see the camelopard and kangaroos in Windsor Park, she\r\nsays, \"He ran about with the latter and the other live animals without\r\nthe least fear, though he got thrown down by them. He is a robust,\r\nsturdy child, sharp as a needle, but so volatile that I foresee some\r\ntrouble in making him fix his attention.\"\r\n\r\nWhen three and a half, she says, \"he certainly is not at all premature;\r\nhis great excellence is in his disposition, and apparently very strong\r\nreasoning powers, and a most tenacious memory as to facts. He is always\r\nasking questions, and never forgets the answers he receives, if they are\r\nsuch as he can comprehend. If there is anything he cannot understand, or\r\nany word, he won't go on till it has been explained to him. He is always\r\nwanting to see everything made, or to know how it is done; there is no\r\nend to his questions, and he is never happy unless he sees the relations\r\nbetween cause and effect.\"\r\n\r\nAt four he began collecting specimens of natural history. At this time a\r\nclergyman brought some fossils to Dr. Buckland. Calling his son, who was\r\nplaying in the room, the Dean said, \"Frankie, what are these?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are the vertebrae of an ichthyosaurus,\" lisped the child, unable to\r\nspeak plainly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Buckland gave her boy a small cabinet, which now bears this\r\ninscription: \"This is the first cabinet I ever had; my mother gave it to\r\nme when about four years old, December, 1830. It is the nucleus of all\r\nmy natural-history work. Please take care of the poor old thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"In his early home at Christ Church,\" says Frank Buckland's\r\nbrother-in-law, George C. Bompas, in his interesting life of the\r\nnaturalist, \"besides the stuffed creatures, which shared the hall with\r\nthe rocking-horse, there were cages full of snakes, and of green frogs,\r\nin the dining-room, where the sideboard groaned under successive layers\r\nof fossils, and the candles stood on ichthyosauri's vertebrae.\r\nGuinea-pigs were often running over the table, and, occasionally, the\r\npony, having trotted down the steps from the garden, would push open the\r\ndining-room door, and career round the table, with three laughing\r\nchildren on his back; and then, marching through the front door, and\r\ndown the steps, would continue his course round Tom Quad.\r\n\r\n\"In the stable yard and large wood-house were the fox, rabbits,\r\nguinea-pigs, and ferrets, hawks and owls, the magpie and jackdaw,\r\nbesides dogs, cats, and poultry, and in the garden was the tortoise (on\r\nwhose back the children would stand to try its strength), and toads\r\nimmured in various pots, to test the truth of their supposed life in\r\nrock cells.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy Frank naturally developed a taste for natural history in the\r\nmidst of such surroundings. At nine years of age, he was sent to school\r\nat Cotterstock, in Northamptonshire, and at twelve was elected scholar\r\nof Winchester College.\r\n\r\nHe tells an interesting experience on his entrance. \"Immediately after\r\nchapel, the old stager boys all came round the new arrivals, to examine\r\nand criticise them. I perfectly recollect one boy, H., to whose special\r\ncare my poor confiding mother had entrusted her innocent, unsuspecting\r\ncub, coming up to me with a most solemn face, and asking me if I had\r\nbrought with me a copy of the school-book, 'Pempe moron proteron.' I\r\nsaid I had not. 'Then,' said he, 'you must borrow one at once, or the\r\ndoctor,' i. e. Dr. Moberly, the head master, 'will be sure to flog you\r\nto-morrow morning, and your college tutor, one of the praefects, will\r\nalso lick you.'\r\n\r\n\"So he sent me to another boy, who said he had _lent_ his 'Pempe moron\r\nproteron,' but he passed me on to a third, he on to a fourth; so I was\r\nrunning about all over the college till quite late, in a most terrible\r\npanic of mind, till at last a good-natured praefect said, 'Construe it,\r\nyou little fool.' I had never thought of this before. I saw it directly:\r\n_Pempe_ (send) _moron_ (a fool) _proteron_ (further). So the title of\r\nthis wonderful book, after all, was, 'Send a fool further.' I then went\r\nto complain to H.; he only laughed, and shied a Donnegan's Lexicon at my\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\n\"A few nights afterwards,\" says Frank, \"I dreamt I was wandering on the\r\nseashore, and that a crab was pinching my foot. Instantly awakening, I\r\nexperienced a most frightful pain in my great toe. I bore it for a\r\nwhile, until at last it became so intense that I had to jump up with a\r\nhowl of agony; all was quiet, but the pull continued, and I had to\r\nfollow my toe and outstretched leg out of bed. I then found a bit of\r\nnetted whipcord tight round it; but the whipcord was so ingeniously\r\ntwisted among the beds, that it was impossible to find out _who had_\r\npulled it. I returned to bed as savage as a wounded animal. The moment I\r\nwas settled, the boys all burst into a shout: 'Toe fit tied! By Jove,\r\nwhat a lark!' This barbarous process is called 'toe fit tie' because\r\nthere is a line in Prosody which begins, 'To fit ti, ut verto verti.'\r\nHence the origin of this Winchester custom.\"\r\n\r\nA school friend says of Frank at this time: \"Imagine a short, quick-eyed\r\nlittle boy, with a shock head of reddish brown hair (not much amenable\r\nto a hair-brush), a white neck-cloth tied like a piece of rope with no\r\nparticular bow, and his bands sticking out under either ear as fancy\r\npleased him,--in fact, a boy utterly indifferent to personal appearance,\r\nbut good-tempered and eccentric, with a small museum in his sleeve or\r\ncupboard, sometimes a snake, or a pet mouse, or a guinea-pig, or even a\r\nhedge-hog. In the summer he would be always in the hedgerows, after\r\nbirds, weasels, or mice, or in the water-meadows, after crayfish,\r\ntomculls, and other fish which hide under stones.... In fact, he was a\r\nborn naturalist.\"\r\n\r\nAnother says: \"Frank set up a sort of amateur dispensary or hospital. He\r\nhad a patient or two. One man I remember, with a bad hand, who used to\r\ncome down to College Gate at twelve o'clock to consult him and be\r\nexperimented upon. In his toys (cupboard) he had various bottles and\r\nspecimens, one very highly treasured possession being a three-legged\r\nchicken.\r\n\r\n\"His own natural disposition was of the sweetest and gentlest. I never\r\nsaw him in a passion, though he used to get a good deal teased at one\r\ntime for his untidiness. But he always had a bright smile amidst it all,\r\nand was ready to do anything for anybody immediately after. One thing\r\nused to strike me very much about him, and that was his exceeding love\r\nfor his mother. Boys are generally reticent upon this point, but Frank\r\nseemed never tired of telling me about his, and how much he owed her....\r\n\r\n\"In school hours he was a painstaking and conscientious worker, never\r\nleaving his lessons or preparing his task quicker or better than when he\r\nhad some pet, a dormouse or sometimes a snake, twisting and wriggling\r\ninside his college waistcoat, which, having found its way out at his\r\nboots, would be carefully replaced under the waistcoat, to go through\r\nthe same journey again.\"\r\n\r\nWhile at Winchester, Frank determined to become a surgeon, and chose as\r\na parting gift from one of his tutors, instead of Goldsmith's poems,\r\n\"Graham's Domestic Medicine.\" At his request, his parents sent him a\r\nlancet, with which he bled his college mates, if they were courageous\r\nenough to submit to the operation, offering each one sixpence as an\r\ninducement. Nevertheless, when, in vacation, he witnessed an amputation\r\nat the Infirmary, he fainted.\r\n\r\nWhen Frank left Winchester, Bishop Moberly said, \"I always had the\r\nutmost satisfaction in him as a school-boy; and I look back with very\r\ngreat regard to his simple, earnest character, and his devotion to the\r\nstudies which have made him so well known. To me he was just what I\r\nalways found him, full of curious information, excellently kind-tempered\r\nand affectionate.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1844, at the age of eighteen, Frank entered Christ Church, Oxford.\r\nHere he turned the court between his college rooms and the canon's\r\ngardens into a menagerie. He owned a young bear, Tiglath Pileser, Jacko\r\nthe monkey, an eagle, a jackal, besides marmots, guinea-pigs, squirrels,\r\nand dormice, an adder and other snakes, tortoises, green frogs and a\r\nchameleon. Skeletons and stuffed specimens were numerous.\r\n\r\nMany of these pets strayed away. The marmot got into the chapter-house,\r\nand the eagle stationed himself in the chapel doorway, and attacked\r\nthose who wished to enter.\r\n\r\nDr. Liddon tells of being invited to Frank's rooms, to breakfast with\r\nhim. \"The marmots, which had hibernated in the cellar below, had just,\r\nas he expressed it, 'thawed.' There was great excitement; the creatures\r\nran about the table, as entitled to the honors of the day; though there\r\nwere other beasts and reptiles in the room too, which in later life\r\nwould have made breakfasting difficult. Speaking of reptiles, one very\r\nearly incident in my Oxford life was joining in a hunt of Frank's adder.\r\nIt had escaped into Mr. Benson's rooms, and was pursued into the bedroom\r\nby a group of undergraduates, who had, however, different objects in\r\nview. Frank certainly had the well-being of the adder chiefly at heart,\r\nthe rest of us, I fear, were governed by the lower motive of escaping\r\nbeing bitten anyhow--if consistently with the adder's safely, well--if\r\nnot, still of escaping. Eventually, the adder was caught, I believe,\r\nwithout great damage.\r\n\r\n\"One day I met Frank just outside Tom Gate. His trousers pockets were\r\nswollen out to an enormous size; they were full of slow-worms in damp\r\nmoss. Frank explained to me that this combination of warmth and moisture\r\nwas good for the slow-worms, and that they enjoyed it. They certainly\r\nwere very lively, poking their heads out incessantly, while he repressed\r\nthem with the palms of his hands....\r\n\r\n\"He was certainly one of the most popular men in Christ Church; when he\r\nwas in the schools, to be examined _viva voce_, almost the whole\r\nundergraduate world of Christ Church was there.... He always struck me,\r\nin respect of the most serious matters, as combining strength and\r\nsimplicity very remarkably; it was impossible to talk to him and not to\r\nbe sure that God, life, death, and judgment were to him solid and\r\nconstantly present realities.\"\r\n\r\nAnother college friend says: \"One evening when I was devoting an hour to\r\ncoaching him up for his 'little go,' I took care to tuck up my legs, in\r\nTurkish fashion, on the sofa, for fear of a casual bite from the jackal\r\nwhich was wandering about the room. After a time I heard the animal\r\nmunching up something under the sofa, and was relieved that he should\r\nhave found something to occupy him. When our work was finished, I told\r\nBuckland that the jackal had found something to eat under the sofa. 'My\r\npoor guinea-pigs!' he exclaimed; and, sure enough, four or five of them\r\nhad fallen victims.\"\r\n\r\nTiglath Pileser, the bear, had to be sent away from Christ Church. The\r\ndean said, \"I hear you keep a bear in college; well, either you or your\r\nbear must go.\" So Tig was sent to Islip, seven miles from Oxford, a\r\nliving held by Dean Buckland, who had now become Dean of Westminster.\r\nThe bear did so much mischief at Islip, in grocer's shops and houses,\r\nthat he was sent to the zooelogical gardens, where he died in cutting his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nJacko, the monkey, was a source of great amusement, and greatly prized\r\nby young Buckland. \"Once, when carrying him on a railway train, in a\r\nlawyer's blue bag,\" says Mr. Buckland, in his \"Curiosities of Natural\r\nHistory,\" published some years afterwards, \"Jacko, who must needs see\r\neverything that was going on, suddenly poked his head out of the bag,\r\nand gave a malicious grin at the ticket-giver. This much frightened the\r\npoor man, but, with great presence of mind, quite astonishing under the\r\ncircumstances, he retaliated the insult, 'Sir, that's a dog; you must\r\npay for it accordingly.' In vain was the monkey made to come out of the\r\nbag and exhibit his whole person; in vain were arguments in full\r\naccordance with the views of Cuvier and Owen urged eagerly, vehemently,\r\nand without hesitation (for the train was on the point of starting), to\r\nprove that the animal in question was not a dog, but a monkey. A dog it\r\nwas in the peculiar views of the official, and three-and-sixpence was\r\npaid.\r\n\r\n\"Thinking to carry the joke further (there were just a few minutes to\r\nspare), I took out from my pocket a live tortoise I happened to have\r\nwith me, and, showing it, said, 'What must I pay for this, as you charge\r\nfor _all_ animals?' The employe adjusted his specs, withdrew from the\r\ndesk to consult with his superior; then returning, gave the verdict with\r\na grave but determined manner, 'No charge for them, sir; them be\r\ninsects.'\" Whenever Jacko got loose, he found mischief. One day he\r\ncovered a shoe, sole and all, with blacking, and poured what was left in\r\nthe bottle inside the shoe. He also rubbed the white kitchen table all\r\nover with black-lead and water.\r\n\r\nYoung Buckland spent his vacations at the University of Giessen, under\r\nthe famous teacher and chemist, Professor Liebig, to whom he became\r\ngreatly attached. \"Returning in October, 1845, I brought with me,\" he\r\nsays, \"about a dozen green tree-frogs, which I had caught in the woods\r\nnear the town.... I started at night on my homeward journey by the\r\ndiligence, and I put the bottle containing the frogs into the pocket\r\ninside the diligence. My fellow-passengers were sleepy old smoke-dried\r\nGermans. Very little conversation took place, and, after the first mile,\r\nevery one settled himself to sleep, and soon all were snoring. I\r\nsuddenly awoke with a start, and found all the sleepers had been roused\r\nat the same moment. On their sleepy faces were depicted fear and anger.\r\nWhat had woke us all up so suddenly?\r\n\r\n\"The morning was just breaking, and my frogs, though in the dark pocket\r\nof the coach, had found it out, and, with one accord, all twelve of them\r\nhad begun their morning song. As if at a given signal, they one and all\r\nof them began to croak as hard as ever they could. The noise their\r\nunited concert made seemed, in the closed compartment of the coach,\r\nquite deafening: well might the Germans look angry; they wanted to throw\r\nthe frogs, bottle and all, out of the window, but I gave the bottle a\r\ngood shaking, and made the frogs keep quiet. The Germans all went to\r\nsleep again, but I was obliged to remain awake, to shake the frogs when\r\nthey began to croak. It was lucky that I did so, for they tried to begin\r\ntheir concert again two or three times.\r\n\r\n\"These frogs came safely to Oxford, and, the day after their arrival, a\r\nstupid housemaid took off the top of the bottle, to see what was inside;\r\none of the frogs croaked at that instant, and so frightened her that she\r\ndared not put the cover on again. They all got loose in the garden,\r\nwhen, I believe, the ducks ate them, for I never heard or saw them\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nThe next autumn, after a short tour in Switzerland, he returned to\r\nOxford, this time bringing a jar full of red slugs. \"They at least were\r\nnoiseless and would not croak like frogs. In the opposite corner of the\r\ndiligence placidly slumbered a traveller with ample bald head; Frank\r\nalso slept, but, waking at midnight, he saw, with horror, that two of\r\nhis red slugs had escaped and were crawling over the traveller's bald\r\npate. What was to be done? To remove them might waken the sleeper. Frank\r\nsat, as it were, on tenter-hooks, until the diligence stopped at the\r\nnext stage, when, firmly covering up the jar and what remained of the\r\nslugs, he slipped quietly out of the diligence, resolved to proceed on\r\nhis journey by another conveyance next morning, rather than face that\r\nman's awakening.\"\r\n\r\nYoung Buckland took his degree in 1848, and entered St. George's\r\nHospital. \"My object,\" he said, \"in studying medicine (and may God\r\nprosper it!) is not to gain a name, money, and high practice, but to do\r\ngood to my fellow-creatures and assist them in the hour of need.... My\r\nobject in life to be a great high-priest of nature, and a great\r\nbenefactor of mankind.\" Wealthy, and of the highest social position, he\r\nhad determined not to live for himself, but for the good of others.\r\n\r\nHe was now twenty-two; genial, full of kindness, democratic in his\r\nfeelings, one of \"nature's noblemen.\" At his father's house, the\r\nDeanery, he met Lyell, Davy, Faraday, Sir John Herschel, Guizot, Liebig,\r\nAgassiz, Ruskin, Rogers, Lord Brougham, Sir Robert Peel, Lord John\r\nRussell, Lady Franklin, Lady Shelley, and scores of other distinguished\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nHere his menagerie was larger than ever. The stuffed forms of Tiglath\r\nPileser and Billy the hyaena were in the hall. Jenny, a monkey from\r\nGibraltar, had come to join Jacko, bringing a pet chicken with her,\r\nwhich lived in her cage, and which she fondled as a nurse does a child.\r\nHere were tailless Manx cats, lizards, snakes, and fifty or sixty rats,\r\nusually kept in the cellar. Young Buckland would often take snakes out\r\nof his pockets to show his friends. \"Don't be afraid,\" he said to a\r\nyoung lady at a party, as he showed her some snakes; \"they won't hurt\r\nyou, I've taken out their fangs. Now, do be a good girl, and don't make\r\na fuss;\" and he wreathed one snake around her neck, and one round each\r\narm. \"His sisters were so often bedecked with similar reptilian\r\nnecklaces and armlets that they became used to the somewhat clammy,\r\ncrawling sensation which is a drawback to such ornaments.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Buckland wrote an article on the muscles of the arm,\r\nand took it to several periodicals, but none would accept it. Urged by\r\nMr. White Cooper, the queen's oculist, he wrote an article upon his\r\nrats, which the friend carried to \"Bentley's Miscellany.\" It was\r\naccepted, and thus began his successful authorship. This was\r\nsubsequently published in his first book, \"Curiosities of Natural\r\nHistory,\" in 1857.\r\n\r\nHe tells of one of his rat families: \"One day a poor mother had moved\r\nher young about into several parts of the cage, but could not fix on one\r\npoint. I saw what was wanting, she could not obtain cover for them. I\r\nput my hand into the cage, full of tow and cotton wool; she came\r\ninstantly and took it out of my hand, and covered up her young. But,\r\nnotwithstanding all this care, and although evidently most anxious for\r\ntheir welfare, this kind mother, obeying, I suppose, some wise law of\r\nnature, devoured during the following night every one of the little ones\r\nof which she had been so careful the preceding day.\"\r\n\r\nAfter being house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital for some time,\r\nBuckland became assistant surgeon to the Second Life Guards in 1854. He\r\nhad already given his first lecture, \"The House We Live in,\" delivered\r\nat a Working Men's Coffee House and Institute established by his mother,\r\nin Westminster, London.\r\n\r\nAbout this time he was nearly fatally poisoned by a cobra. He says, \"I\r\nhad not walked a hundred yards before, all of a sudden, I felt just as\r\nif somebody had come behind me and struck me a severe blow on the head\r\nand neck, and at the same time I experienced a most acute pain and sense\r\nof oppression at the chest, as though a hot iron had been run in and a\r\nhundred-weight put on the top of it. I knew instantly, from what I had\r\nread, that I was poisoned. I said as much to my friend, a most\r\nintelligent gentleman, who happened to be with me, and told him, if I\r\nfell, to give me brandy and _eau-de-luce_, words which he kept repeating\r\nin case he might forget them. At the same time I enjoined him to keep me\r\ngoing, and not on any account to allow me to lie down. I then forgot\r\neverything for several minutes, and my friend tells me I rolled about as\r\nif very faint and weak. He also informs me that the first thing I did\r\nwas to fall against him, asking him if I looked seedy. He most wisely\r\nanswered, 'No, you look very well.' I don't think he thought so, for his\r\nown face was as white as a ghost; I recollect this much. He tells me my\r\nface was of a greenish yellow color.\r\n\r\n\"After walking, or rather staggering, along for some minutes, I\r\ngradually recovered my senses, and steered for the nearest chemist's\r\nshop. Rushing in, I asked for _eau-de-luce_. Of course, he had none, but\r\nmy eye caught the words, '_spiritus ammoniae_,' or hartshorn, on a\r\nbottle. I reached it down myself, and, pouring a large quantity into a\r\ntumbler with a little water, both of which articles I found on a\r\nsoda-water stand in the shop, drank it off, though it burnt my mouth and\r\nlips very much. Instantly I felt relief from the pain at the chest and\r\nhead. The chemist stood aghast, and, on my telling him what was the\r\nmatter, recommended a warm bath. If I had then followed his advice,\r\nthese words would never have been placed on record. After a second\r\ndraught at the hartshorn bottle, I proceeded on my way, feeling very\r\nstupid and confused.\"\r\n\r\nIn August, 1856, Dean Buckland died, and in November, 1857, Mrs.\r\nBuckland. On December 17, her son wrote in his journal: \"Thirty-one\r\nyears ago, at 6 A. M., I came into the world, at the old house in\r\nChrist Church, Quadrangle. I am now about half-way across the stage of\r\nlife, and thank God I am just beginning to feel my feet. But, oh! what I\r\nhave lost since last birthday, the best friend a man can have in the\r\nworld,--his mother.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not know that he was very much more than \"half-way across the\r\nstage of life already.\" It is well that we walk by faith rather than\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n  \"Oh! blissful, peaceful ignorance,\r\n    'Tis blessed not to know;\r\n  It keeps me quiet in those Arms\r\n    Which will not let me go,\r\n  And hushes all my soul to rest\r\n    On the Bosom which loves me so.\r\n\r\n  \"So I go on, not knowing--\r\n    I would not if I might--\r\n  I'd rather walk with God in the dark\r\n    Than walk alone in the light;\r\n  I'd rather walk with him by faith\r\n    Than walk alone by sight.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1859, after a laborious search of some weeks in the vaults of St.\r\nMartin's in the Fields, Buckland found the body of John Hunter, the\r\nfather of modern physiology, and the coffin was reinterred in\r\nWestminster Abbey. Though a most disagreeable task, he said, \"I must not\r\nshrink from doing a thing at first sight disagreeable, or nothing will\r\never be accomplished. Nothing like determination and perseverance.\" The\r\nLeeds School of Medicine presented him a silver medal, as a mark of\r\nrespect for his exertions.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, he helped to organize the Acclimatization Society, formed for\r\nthe purpose of varying and increasing the food supply of Great Britain\r\nby introducing new animals and preserving the native fish. He also\r\nbecame voluntary consulting surgeon at the Zooelogical Gardens, doctoring\r\nthe sick, and increasing by his example the tenderness shown to animals.\r\n\r\nHis life had now become a most active one. He wrote many valuable\r\narticles for the magazines, since issued in books, the \"Log Book of a\r\nFisherman and Zooelogist,\" and other volumes, and lectured frequently, to\r\nlarge audiences, on his favorite subjects.\r\n\r\nIn 1863, after eight years of service in the Life Guards, he resigned,\r\nand began to devote himself more than ever to fish culture. In January\r\nand February of each year he collected the eggs of trout and other fish\r\nfrom the Rhine, Switzerland, France, and elsewhere, distributing some\r\nthroughout the country and artificially hatching others. Fish-hatching\r\nboxes were exhibited in the South Kensington Museum, and at the Crystal\r\nPalace. Trout ova in ice were sent to Australia, where, after incubation\r\nhad been suspended for a hundred days, when placed in running water, the\r\nfish came into the world strong and healthy.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, Buckland made extended investigations in oyster culture;\r\ndelivered lectures upon the subject before the British Association of\r\nBath, the Society of Arts, the London Institution, indeed all through\r\nEngland and Ireland. He was appointed Scientific Referee to the South\r\nKensington Museum, giving a course of lectures and of class\r\ndemonstration. He sent about sixteen thousand young fish and eggs to the\r\nHorticultural Gardens, and with these he helped to illustrate his\r\nlectures and inform the public.\r\n\r\nThrough \"Land and Water,\" a paper established by himself and a few\r\nfriends, he reached and educated a large constituency.\r\n\r\nIn 1863, the year previous, he had married Miss Hannah Papes, and made\r\nhis home at 37 Albany St., Regent's Park. Here he gathered all his pets,\r\nwho found in Mrs. Buckland a person as kind and tender as their master.\r\nHere were brought his favorite monkeys, \"Hag\" and \"Tiny.\" The latter\r\ncame from the Zooelogical Gardens \"as good as dead,\" but, through Mrs.\r\nBuckland's good nursing, she became well and strong.\r\n\r\nWith these pets, the overworked naturalist had great merriment. He says\r\nin his \"Log Book\": \"When the fire is lighted in the morning, in my\r\nmuseum, the servants put the monkeys in their night cage before it, and\r\ndirectly I come down to breakfast I let them out. They are only allowed\r\nto be loose in my museum as they do so much mischief; and in my museum I\r\nalone am responsible for the damage they do. The moment the door of the\r\ncage is opened, they both rush out like rockets, and the Hag goes\r\nimmediately to the fender and warms herself like a good monkey; as she,\r\nbeing older, seems to know that if she misbehaves herself she will have\r\nto be put back into her cage....\r\n\r\n\"Tiny steals whatever is on the table, and it is great fun to see her\r\nsnatch off the red herring from the plate and run off with it to the top\r\nof the book-shelves. While I am getting my herring, Tiny goes to the\r\nbreakfast table again, and, if she can, steals the egg; this she tucks\r\nunder her arm, and bolts away, running on her hind legs. This young lady\r\nhas of late been rather shy of eggs, as she once stole one that was\r\nquite hot, and burnt herself....\r\n\r\n\"Having poured out the tea, I open the 'Times' newspaper quite wide, to\r\ntake a general survey of its contents. If I do not watch her carefully,\r\nTiny goes behind the chair, on to the book-shelf, and comes crash into\r\nthe middle of the 'Times.' Of course, she cannot go through the 'Times';\r\nbut she takes her chance of a fall somewhere, and her great aim seems,\r\nto perform the double feat of knocking the 'Times' out of my hand and\r\nupsetting the tea-pot and its contents; or, better still, the tea-pot on\r\nthe floor. Lately, I am glad to say, she did not calculate her fall\r\nquite right; for she put her foot into the hot tea and stung herself\r\nsmartly, and this seems to have had the effect of making her more\r\ncareful for the future. All the day of this misfortune she walked upon\r\nher heels, and not upon her toes as usual.\r\n\r\n\"The Hag will also steal, but in a more quiet manner. She is especially\r\nfond of sardines in oil, and I generally let her steal them, because the\r\noil does her good, though the servants complain of the marks of her oily\r\nfeet upon the cloth. Sometimes the two make up a stealing party. One\r\nmorning I was in a particular hurry, having to go away on\r\nsalmon-inspection duty by train. I left the breakfast things for a\r\nmoment, and in an instant Tiny snatched up a broiled leg of pheasant and\r\nbolted with it--carried it under her arm round and round the room, after\r\nthe fashion of the clown in the pantomime. While I was hunting Tiny for\r\nmy pheasant, the Hag bolted with the toast; I could not find time to\r\ncatch either of the thieves, and so had to go off without any breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Tiny and the Hag sometimes go out stealing together. They climb up my\r\ncoat and search all the pockets. I generally carry a great many cedar\r\npencils; the monkeys take these out and bite off the cut ends.... When I\r\ncome home in the evening, tired from a long day's work, I let out the\r\nmonkeys, and give them some sweet stuff I bring home for them. By their\r\naffectionate greeting and amusing tricks they make me forget for a while\r\nthe anxieties and bothers of a very active life. They know perfectly\r\nwell when I am busy, and they remain quiet and do not tease me. The Hag\r\nsits on the top of my head, and 'looks fleas' in my hair, while Tiny\r\ntears up with her teeth a thick ball of crumpled paper, the nucleus of\r\nwhich she knows is a sugar-plum, one of a parcel sent by Mrs. Owen, the\r\nkind-hearted wife of my friend, Mostyn Owen, of the Dee Salmon Board,\r\nand received through the post in due form, directed, 'Miss Tiny and Miss\r\nJenny Buckland.'\"\r\n\r\nBesides these monkeys, a writer tells of another pet which he found when\r\ncalling on Mr. Buckland. \"'It's a jolly little brute, and won't hurt,'\r\nexclaimed Mr. Buckland, as we were about to retreat from the threshold.\r\nThe monkeys had seized the jaguar's tail, and, lifting it up with its\r\nhind legs bodily to the altitude of their cage, were rapidly denuding it\r\nof fur. No animal with any feelings of self-respect would submit\r\nsilently to such humiliation, and the jaguar was making the place\r\nhideous with his yells.\r\n\r\n\"Hearing the cries of her pet, Mrs. Buckland came to the rescue; and it\r\nwas amusing to see this child of the forest, with gleaming eyes and\r\nfrantic yelps, cast itself at her feet, and nestle meekly in the folds\r\nof her dress; she had nursed it through a very trying babyhood, when Mr.\r\nBartlett had sent it from the Zoo, apparently dying and paralyzed in the\r\nfore-legs, with a promise of fifteen pounds reward for a cure. That sum\r\nhas long since been swallowed up in damages for clothes destroyed and\r\nboots devoured, as the invalid's health and appetite returned.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Buckland used to say: \"Mrs. Buckland can tame any animal in the\r\nworld--_ecce signum_, myself.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1867, Mr. Buckland was appointed Inspector of Fisheries. This was the\r\nrealization of the wish of his life. He says in his diary, after\r\nreceiving the appointment: \"When I read this I felt a most peculiar\r\nfeeling; not joy, nor grief, but a pleasurable, stunning sensation, if\r\nthere can be such a thing. The first thing I did was to utter a prayer\r\nof thanksgiving to Him who really appointed me, and who has thus placed\r\nme in a position to look after and care for His wonderful works. May He\r\ngive me strength to do my duty in my new calling!\"\r\n\r\nBuckland carried forward his work with the greatest zeal and energy. He\r\nwrites in his journal: \"I am now working from 8 A. M. to 6 P. M., then a\r\nbit in the evening,--fourteen hours a day; but, thank God, it does not\r\nhurt me. I should, however, collapse if it were not for Sunday. The\r\nmachinery has time to get cool. The mill-wheel ceases to patter the\r\nwater, the mill-head is ponded up, and the superfluous water let off by\r\nan easy, quiet current, which leads to things above.\"\r\n\r\nSalmon, which had formerly abounded in Wales and England, and been used\r\nextensively for food, had almost or altogether ceased to exist in many\r\nrivers. Buckland carefully studied their habits. He put himself, as he\r\noften said, in the place of the salmon. He waded the pools, to feel the\r\nforce and direction of the current against which they come up from the\r\nsea into the rivers. He did not spare himself in storm or cold.\r\n\r\n\"Most fish live either in fresh or in salt water; the salmon inhabits\r\nboth. Bred in the higher waters of our rivers, the young salmon of one,\r\ntwo, or three years' growth make their way down to the sea as smolts,\r\nand return thence, impelled by the instinct of reproduction, to seek the\r\ngravelly spawning beds in the mountain streams. In early spring and\r\nthrough the summer and autumn months they come from the sea,\r\nbright-coated and silvery, and swim and leap and struggle up the rivers.\r\nThen is the fisherman's harvest. In winter the spawning time comes on,\r\nwhen the laws of nature and of man alike forbid their capture; for the\r\nfish, at other times so rich a luxury, are now vapid and unwholesome.\r\nLean and flabby, the males with hooked beaks and scarred in fighting,\r\nthe spawned fish, or kelts, rush down again to the sea; whence, after a\r\nwhile, they return, fresh and silvery, fattened to twice their former\r\nweight, and reenter the rivers as fresh-river fish, the joy alike of the\r\nfisherman and the epicure.\"\r\n\r\nBuckland constructed salmon ladders over the weirs, that the fish might\r\nhave free passage from the rivers to the sea. He sent a series of models\r\nof these ladders to the American Fishery Commissioners, with five boxes\r\nof specimen oysters, and a photograph of his museum, with its casts and\r\ncuriosities. He helped to obtain proper legislation from Parliament,\r\nboth as to fishes and sea-birds; indeed all living things, especially\r\nthose aquatic, had his sympathy and help.\r\n\r\nThe results of his work were soon apparent. The yearly sales of English\r\nand Welsh salmon in Billingsgate market, London, before 1861, averaged\r\nabout eight tons only. From 1867 to 1876 the average sale was\r\neighty-eight tons. The sales of Irish salmon in Billingsgate, three\r\nhundred and fifty tons yearly; of Scotch salmon, over one thousand tons\r\nyearly. Thus was food provided for millions of people.\r\n\r\nEverywhere Buckland was the friend of animals. He urged that pigs should\r\nhave \"pure, clean, wholesome water\" to drink. He assisted at the opening\r\nof the Brighton Aquarium, a place which American visitors can never\r\nforget, and aided in the establishing of other aquaria.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, Mr. Buckland published a \"History of British Fishes.\" All his\r\nbooks went through many editions. In 1874, at the Jubilee Anniversary of\r\nthe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, he spoke against\r\ncruelty to seals.\r\n\r\nHe wrote in the \"Times\": \"Captain David Gray, of the sealing and whaling\r\nship Eclipse, and myself first brought forward, some three years ago,\r\nthe necessity for a close time for Arctic seals. The principal sealing\r\nground is at Jan Mayen Island, thirteen hundred miles due north from\r\nLondon.... The ships (sixty sail) arrive at the ice from the 15th to the\r\n20th March, just as the young seals are born. The seal-hunters at once\r\nattack them, and the most horrible cruelty ensues. I quote Captain\r\nGray's own words to me: 'Last year, the fleet set to work to kill the\r\nseals on March 26, 1874, and in forty-eight hours the fishing was\r\ncompletely over, the old seals being shot, wounded, or scared away,\r\nwhile thousands upon thousands of young ones were left crying piteously\r\nfor their mothers. These mostly perished of famine in the snow, as they\r\nwere not old enough to make worth while the trouble of killing them.\r\n\r\n\"'If you could imagine yourself surrounded by four or five hundred\r\nthousand babies, all crying at the pitch of their voices, you would have\r\nsome idea of the piteous noise they make. Their cry is very like that of\r\na human infant. These motherless seals collect into lots of five or six,\r\nand crawl about the ice, their heads fast becoming the biggest part of\r\ntheir bodies, searching, no doubt, to find the nourishment they stand so\r\nmuch in need of.'\"\r\n\r\nIn 1876, an international close time was established, prohibiting the\r\nkilling of seals until after April 3.\r\n\r\nMr. Buckland's reports on crab, lobster, herring, and other fisheries\r\nwere most full and interesting. \"Before the young crabs are born,\" he\r\nsaid, \"the mother crab tucks up under her tail her numerous family of\r\nfrom one to two million coral-like eggs, and she sidles on tiptoe many a\r\nmile from her rocky home to some sandy flat in the deep sea, where her\r\nyoung family may flourish best. There, or perhaps on returning home, in\r\nearly spring, the time for all young things to come forth, the tiny\r\ncrabs burst the egg; yet so unlike their parent, that till lately they\r\nwere thought some strange animalcula; goggle eyes, a hawk's beak, a\r\nscorpion's tail, a rhinoceros's horn, adorn a body fringed with legs,\r\nyet scarcely bigger than a grain of sand.\r\n\r\n\"Several strange shapes are assumed in turn ere the young crab attains\r\nthe parent form. For the parents of so numerous a family it is well that\r\nnature has provided the young crabs with a strong suit of clothes, which\r\ndoes not wear out; but it is quickly outgrown. The young crabs shed from\r\ntime to time the horny case, even to the finger-nails and eyelids; and\r\nmother Nature straightway provides, underneath, a new, soft, leathery\r\nsuit, which quickly hardens into shell. Another marvel is, that the\r\ngrowth is, as it were, by leaps and bounds; each time it bursts its case\r\nthe young crab swells suddenly to twice the size of the discarded shell.\r\n\r\n\"In crab youth several new suits are annually required. In maturer life\r\nthe lady crab, it seems, is content with one new dress each year; yet is\r\nnot the romance of life over. In the time of her soft-shelled weakness\r\nand seclusion, a male crab in full armor constantly attends her, guards\r\nher from danger, and solaces her in her retirement. An old crab's shell,\r\ncovered sometimes with barnacles, or with oysters of several years'\r\ngrowth, shows that the patriarch has outlived the change of fashions\r\nwhich occupied his youth.\"\r\n\r\nThe report on herring showed that eight hundred million fish are taken\r\nyearly in Scotland, by more than seven thousand boats.\r\n\r\n\"The Log-Book of a Fisherman and Zooelogist\" was published in 1875, and a\r\nnew edition of \"White's Natural History of Selborne,\" to which Buckland\r\nadded many original observations. Most of his writing was done on the\r\ncars, on his way to different places to give lectures or attend to\r\nofficial business.\r\n\r\nIn 1878, he was appointed one of the commissioners to inquire into the\r\nsea fisheries of England and Wales, which furnish so much food for the\r\npeople. Over a hundred million soles are sold yearly in London alone,\r\nbesides fifty million plaice and whiting, and ten million eels. Mr.\r\nBuckland's correspondence with many countries had become extensive. He\r\nhad been elected a member of various societies, and had received many\r\ngold medals, for his wide scientific knowledge and its practical\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1879, he writes, \"This Christmas week, I regret to say, I\r\nshall not have the opportunity of spending my time up to my neck in\r\nwater, collecting salmon eggs for Australia or New Zealand, from one or\r\nother of our northern rivers, or in one of the southern rivers, getting\r\ntrout eggs for the Thames. I must say I very much enjoy collecting\r\nsalmon and trout eggs; it is very cold, and, at the same time, very hard\r\nwork, but I very much prefer it to indoors and the fireside.\"\r\n\r\nThe exposure of this kind of work is seen by his description of it.\r\n\"Here is a list of my 'Spawning kit.' First, the waterproof dress; this\r\nvery useful garment is in fact a diver's dress, and, when properly put\r\non, admits not a drop of water. It has, however, one fault, _it is apt\r\nto freeze_ when I am out of the water, and then one feels encased, as it\r\nwere, in a suit of inflexible armor. Second, the spawning tins....\r\nThird, a long, shallow basket.... Fourth, house-flannel, cut into\r\nlengths of one yard; this is absolutely necessary to hold the struggling\r\nsalmon. Those who are unaccustomed to spawn salmon have an awkward habit\r\nof putting their fingers into the gills of the fish, and if the fish's\r\ngills are injured and bleed, he suffers much from it. I never to my\r\nknowledge killed a fish in my life while spawning it. Fifth, dry towels;\r\nthese are most necessary, as the slime from the salmon makes one's hands\r\nvery slippery ... besides which, wiping the hands warms them, and, when\r\nworking in the water at this time of year, the cold to the hands and\r\narms is fearful.... Eleventh, ordinary baggage, and especially a bottle\r\nof scented hair-oil, with which to well anoint the chest and arms and\r\ntips of ears, when working in the water; a most excellent and\r\nserviceable plan. I took this hint from the Esquimaux.\"\r\n\r\nFrank Buckland's last Fishery Report was made in March, 1880, containing\r\nan interesting description of the anatomy of the salmon, its food,\r\nhabits, and the like.\r\n\r\nMr. Buckland had brought on lung trouble by constant exposure and\r\ntireless energy, and must have foreseen the end. At first it seemed hard\r\nto him that he should be taken in the midst of his best work, but he\r\nsaid, \"God is so good, so very good to the little fishes, I do not\r\nbelieve he would let their inspector suffer shipwreck at last. I am\r\ngoing a long journey, where I think I shall see a great many curious\r\nanimals. This journey I must go alone.\"\r\n\r\nHe had before this written in his diary: \"I think it not improbable\r\nthat, in a future state, the mind will be allowed a greater scope of\r\nknowledge, and the gates of omniscience will be thrown open to it, so\r\nthat those things which it now sees through a glass, darkly, will be\r\nopened to the view and understanding. O most glorious reward, for a mind\r\noccupied here on earth in investigating the wonderful works of the\r\nCreator, from the magnificent and stupendously grand scene of geology,\r\nand the theory of the heavens, to the minute and delicate construction\r\nof a microscopic animalcule, or the immeasurably fine thread of a\r\nplant!\"\r\n\r\nHe died December 19, 1880, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, on\r\nChristmas Eve.\r\n\r\nHis last book, \"Notes and Jottings from Animal Life,\" was published soon\r\nafter his death.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the noble son of the Dean of Westminster is remembered\r\nand loved. A friend wrote, after his death: \"Energy was only one of Mr.\r\nBuckland's characteristics. His kindliness was another. Perhaps no man\r\never lived with a kinder heart. It may be doubted whether he ever\r\nwillingly said a hard word or did a hard action. He used to say of one\r\ngentleman, by whom he thought he had been aggrieved, that he had\r\nforgiven him seventy times seven already, so that he was not required to\r\nforgive him any more.\r\n\r\n\"He could not resist a cry of distress, particularly if it came from a\r\nwoman. Women, he used to say, are such doe-like, timid things, that he\r\ncould not bear to see them unhappy. One night, walking from his office,\r\nhe found a poor servant-girl crying in the street. She had been turned\r\nout of her place that morning, as unequal to her duties; she had no\r\nmoney and no friends nearer than Taunton, where her parents lived. Mr.\r\nBuckland took her to an eating-house, gave her a dinner, drove her to\r\nPaddington, paid for her ticket, and left her in charge of the guard of\r\nthe train. His nature was so simple and generous that he did not even\r\nseem to realize that he had done an exceptionally kind action.\"\r\n\r\nTo read of such a life as this makes us trust humanity, and reassures us\r\nthat there are many, very many noble and lovely characters in the world,\r\nboth men and women. While we need good judgment and common sense, so as\r\nto discriminate wisely, we need also the sweet, sunny nature which, with\r\nsome measure of ideality, sees rose colors amid the sombre tints of\r\nlife. We usually find in other hearts what we cultivate in our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Sarah K.

SARAH KNOWLES BOLTON\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nComes from good New England ancestry; descended on her father's side\r\nfrom Henry Knowles, who came to Rhode Island from London, England, in\r\n1635, and on her mother's side from Colonel Nathaniel Stanley, of\r\nHartford, Conn., one of the leading men of the colony, and from Colonel\r\nWilliam Pynchon, one of the twenty-six incorporators of Massachusetts\r\nBay Colony. She was graduated from the Hartford Seminary, established by\r\nCatharine Beecher; published a volume of poems, and in 1866 married\r\nCharles E. Bolton, A.M., of Massachusetts, an Amherst College graduate\r\nof '65. They removed to Cleveland, O., where, besides writing for\r\nvarious periodicals, she did much charitable work. She was secretary of\r\nthe Woman's Christian Association, and Asst. Cor. Sec. of the Nat. W. C.\r\nT. U. She has twice visited Europe, spending two years in England,\r\nFrance, Italy, Germany, Russia, Norway and Sweden, studying literary and\r\neducational matters, and the means used by employers for the mental and\r\nmoral elevation of their employees. On the latter subject she read a\r\npaper before the American Social Science Association in 1883. She was\r\nfor three years one of the editors of the Boston _Congregationalist_.\r\nShe prepared several small books for the Cleveland Educational Bureau,\r\nconducted gratuitously by her husband, and described by Dr. Washington\r\nGladden in the _Century_ magazine, January, 1885. The Bureau was\r\ndiscontinued when Mr. Bolton gave his time to lecturing. Miss Frances E.\r\nWillard says of Mrs. Bolton, \"She is one of the best-informed women in\r\nAmerica, the chief woman biographer of our times.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nT. Y.
