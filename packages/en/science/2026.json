AT HAMPTON COURT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR’S PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nI recall to mind a British colonel, who said to me in Calcutta: “This is\r\nthe third time that I have been sent to India. Twenty-five years ago, as\r\nlieutenant, and then the Russians were some fifteen hundred miles from\r\nthe Indian frontier; then, six years since, as captain, and the Russians\r\nwere then only five hundred miles away. A year ago I came here as\r\nlieutenant-colonel, and the Russians are right up to the passes leading\r\nto India.”\r\n\r\nThe map of the world unfolds itself before me. All seas are ploughed\r\nby the keels of English vessels, all coasts dotted with the coaling\r\nstations and fortresses of the British world-power. In England is vested\r\nthe dominion of the globe, and England will retain it; she cannot permit\r\nthe Russian monster to drink life and mobility from the sea.\r\n\r\n“Without England’s permission no shot can be fired on the ocean,” once\r\nsaid William Pitt, England’s greatest statesman. For many, many\r\nyears England has increased her lead, owing to dissensions among the\r\ncontinental Powers. Almost all wars have, for centuries past, been\r\nwaged in the interests of England, and almost all have been incited\r\nby England. Only when Bismarck’s genius presided over Germany did the\r\nGerman Michael become conscious of his own strength, and wage his own\r\nwars.\r\n\r\nAre things to come to this pass, that Germany is to crave of England’s\r\nbounty--her air and light, and her very daily bread? or does their\r\nancient vigour no longer animate Michael’s arms?\r\n\r\nShall the three Powers who, after Japan’s victory over China, joined\r\nhands in the treaty of Shimonoseki, in order to thwart England’s aims,\r\nshall they--Germany, France, and Russia--still fold their hands, or\r\nshall they not rather mutually join them in a common cause?\r\n\r\nIn my mind’s eye I see the armies and the fleets of Germany, France, and\r\nRussia moving together against the common enemy, who with his polypus\r\narms enfolds the globe. The iron onslaught of the three allied Powers\r\nwill free the whole of Europe from England’s tight embrace. The great\r\nwar lies in the lap of the future.\r\n\r\nThe story that I shall portray in the following pages is not a chapter\r\nof the world’s past history; it is the picture as it clearly developed\r\nitself to my mind’s eye, on the publication of the first despatch of the\r\nViceroy Alexieff to the Tsar of Russia. And, simultaneously like a flash\r\nof lightning, the telegram which the Emperor William sent to the Boers\r\nafter Jameson’s Raid crosses my memory--that telegram which aroused in\r\nthe heart of the German nation such an abiding echo. I gaze into the\r\npicture, and am mindful of the duties and aims of our German nation. My\r\ndreams, the dreams of a German, show me the war that is to be, and\r\nthe victory of the three great allied nations. Germany, France, and\r\nRussia--and a new division of the possessions of the earth as the final\r\naim and object of this gigantic universal war.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR’S NOTE\r\n\r\nThis volume is the authorised translation of Der Weltkrieg deutsche\r\nTraume (F. W. Vobach and Co., Leipsic). The translator offers no comment\r\non the day-dream which he reproduces in the English language for English\r\nreaders. The meaning and the moral should be obvious and valuable.\r\n\r\nLONDON, September, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMING CONQUEST OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE COUNCIL OF STATE\r\n\r\nIt was a brilliant assemblage of high dignitaries and military officers\r\nthat had gathered in the Imperial Winter Palace at St. Petersburg. Of\r\nthe influential personages, who, by reason of their official position\r\nor their personal relations to the ruling house, were summoned to advise\r\nand determine the destiny of the Tsar’s Empire, scarcely one was absent.\r\nBut it was no festal occasion that had called them here; for all faces\r\nwore an expression of deep seriousness, amounting in certain cases to\r\none of grave anxiety. The conversation, carried on in undertones, was of\r\nmatters of the gravest import.\r\n\r\nThe broad folding-doors facing the lifesize portrait of the reigning\r\nTsar were thrown wide open, and amid the breathless silence of all\r\nassembled, the grey-headed President of the Imperial Council, Grand Duke\r\nMichael, entered the hall. Two other members of the Imperial house, the\r\nGrand Dukes Vladimir Alexandrovitch and Alexis Alexandrovitch, brothers\r\nof the late Tsar, accompanied him.\r\n\r\nThe princes graciously acknowledged the deep obeisances of all present.\r\nAt a sign from the Grand Duke Michael, the whole company took their\r\nplaces at the long conference table, covered with green cloth, which\r\nstood in the centre of the pillared hall. Deep, respectful silence still\r\ncontinued, until, at a sign from the President, State Secretary Witte,\r\nthe chief of the ministerial council, turned to the Grand Dukes and\r\nbegan thus:--\r\n\r\n“Your Imperial Highnesses and Gentlemen! Your Imperial Highness has\r\nsummoned us to an urgent meeting, and has commissioned me to lay before\r\nyou the reasons for, and the purpose of, our deliberations. We are all\r\naware that His Majesty the Emperor, our gracious Lord and Master, has\r\ndeclared the preservation of the peace of the world to be the highest\r\naim of his policy. The Christian idea that mankind should be ‘ONE fold\r\nunder ONE shepherd’ has, in the person of our illustrious ruler, found\r\nits first and principal representative here on earth. The league of\r\nuniversal peace is solely due to His Majesty, and if we are called upon\r\nto present to our gracious Lord and Master our humble proposals for\r\ncombating the danger which immediately menaces our country, all our\r\ndeliberations should be inspired by that spirit which animates the\r\nChristian law of brotherly love.”\r\n\r\nGrand Duke Michael raised his hand in interruption. “Alexander\r\nNicolaievitch,” he said, turning to the Secretary, “do not omit to write\r\ndown this last sentence WORD FOR WORD.”\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State made a short pause, only to continue with a\r\nsomewhat louder voice and in a more emphatic tone--\r\n\r\n“No especial assurance is required that, in view of this, our noble\r\nliege lord’s exalted frame of mind, a breach of the world’s peace could\r\nnot possibly come from our side. But our national honour is a sacred\r\npossession, which we can never permit others to assail, and the attack\r\nwhich Japan has made upon us in the Far East forced us to defend it\r\nsword in hand. There is not a single right-minded man in the whole world\r\nwho could level a reproach at us for this war, which has been forced\r\nupon us. But in our present danger a law of self-preservation impels\r\nus to inquire whether Japan is, after all, the only and the real enemy\r\nagainst whom we have to defend ourselves; and there are substantial\r\nreasons for believing that this question should be answered in the\r\nnegative. His Majesty’s Government is convinced that we are indebted\r\nfor this attack on the part of Japan solely to the constant enmity of\r\nEngland, who never ceases her secret machinations against us. It has\r\nbeen England’s eternal policy to damage us for her own aggrandisement.\r\nAll our endeavours to promote the welfare of this Empire and make the\r\npeoples happy have ever met with resistance on the part of England.\r\nFrom the China Seas, throughout all Asia to the Baltic, England has ever\r\nthrown obstacles in our way, in order to deprive us of the fruits of our\r\ncivilising policy. No one of us doubts for a moment that Japan is, in\r\nreality, doing England’s work. Moreover, in every part of the globe\r\nwhere our interests are at stake, we encounter either the open or covert\r\nhostility of England. The complications in the Balkans and in Turkey,\r\nwhich England has incited and fostered by the most despicable methods,\r\nhave simply the one object in view--to bring us into mortal conflict\r\nwith Austria and Germany. Yet nowhere are Great Britain’s real aims\r\nclearer seen than in Central Asia. With indescribable toil and with\r\nuntold sacrifice of treasure and blood our rulers have entered the\r\nbarren tracts of country lying between the Black Sea and the Caspian,\r\nonce inhabited by semibarbarous tribes, and, further east again, the\r\nlands stretching away to the Chinese frontier and the Himalayas, and\r\nhave rendered them accessible to Russian civilisation. But we have\r\nnever taken a step, either east or south, without meeting with English\r\nopposition or English intrigues. To-day our frontiers march with the\r\nfrontier of British East India, and impinge upon the frontier of Persia\r\nand Afghanistan. We have opened up friendly relations with both these\r\nstates, entertain close commercial intercourse with their peoples,\r\nsupport their industrial undertakings, and shun no sacrifice to make\r\nthem amenable to the blessings of civilisation. Yet, step by step,\r\nEngland endeavours to hamper our activity. British gold and British\r\nintrigues have succeeded in making Afghanistan adopt a hostile attitude\r\ntowards us. We must at last ask ourselves this question: How long do we\r\nintend to look on quietly at these undertakings? Russia must push\r\nher way down to the sea. Millions of strong arms till the soil of our\r\ncountry. We have at our own command inexhaustible treasures of corn,\r\nwood, and all products of agriculture; yet we are unable to reach the\r\nmarkets of the world with even an insignificant fraction of these fruits\r\nof the earth that Providence has bestowed, because we are hemmed in, and\r\nhampered on every side, so long as our way to the sea is blocked. Our\r\nmid-Asiatic possessions are suffocated from want of sea air. England\r\nknows this but too well, and therefore she devotes all her energies\r\ntowards cutting us off from the sea. With an insolence, for which there\r\nis no justification, she declares the Persian Gulf to be her own domain,\r\nand would like to claim the whole of the Indian Ocean, as she already\r\nclaims India itself, as her own exclusive property. This aggression must\r\nat last be met with a firm ‘Hands off,’ unless our dear country is to\r\nrun the risk of suffering incalculable damage. It is not we who seek\r\nwar; war is being forced upon us. As to the means at our disposal for\r\nwaging it, supposing England will not spontaneously agree to our just\r\ndemands, His Excellency the Minister of War will be best able to give us\r\nparticulars.”\r\n\r\nHe bowed once more to the Grand Dukes and resumed his seat. The tall,\r\nstately figure of the War Minister, Kuropatkin, next rose, at a sign\r\nfrom the President, and said--\r\n\r\n“For twenty years I served in Central Asia and I am able to judge, from\r\nmy own experience, of our position on the south frontier. In case of\r\na war with England, Afghanistan is the battle-ground of primary\r\nimportance. Three strategic passes lead from Afghanistan into India: the\r\nKhyber Pass, the Bolan Pass, and the Kuram Valley. When, in 1878, the\r\nEnglish marched into Afghanistan they proceeded in three columns from\r\nPeshawar, Kohat, and Quetta to Cabul, Ghazni, and Kandahar respectively.\r\nThese three roads have also been laid down as our lines of march. Public\r\nopinion considers them the only possible routes. It would carry me too\r\nfar into detail were I to propound in this place my views as to the\r\n‘pros and cons’ of this accepted view. In short, we SHALL find our way\r\ninto India. Hahibullah Khan would join us with his army, 60,000 strong,\r\nas soon as we enter his territory. Of course, he is an ally of doubtful\r\nintegrity, for he would probably quite as readily join the English, were\r\nthey to anticipate us and make their appearance in his country with a\r\nsufficiently imposing force. But nothing prevents our being first. Our\r\nrailway goes as far as Merv, seventy-five miles from Herat, and from\r\nthis central station to the Afghan frontier. With our trans-Caspian\r\nrailway we can bring the Caucasian army corps and the troops of\r\nTurkestan to the Afghan frontier. I would undertake, within four weeks\r\nof the outbreak of war, to mass a sufficient field army in Afghanistan\r\nround Herat. Our first army can then be followed by a ceaseless stream\r\nof regiments and batteries. The reserves of the Russian army are\r\ninexhaustible, and we could place, if needs be, four million soldiers\r\nand more than half a million of horses in the field. However, I am more\r\nthan doubtful whether England would meet us in Afghanistan. The English\r\ngenerals would not, in any case, be well advised to leave India. Were\r\nthey defeated in Afghanistan only small fragments of their army at most\r\nwould escape back to India. The Afghans would show no mercy to a\r\nfleeing English army and would destroy it, as has happened on a previous\r\noccasion. If, on the other hand, which God forbid! the fortune of war\r\nshould turn against us, we should always find a line of retreat to\r\nTurkestan open and be able to renew the attack at pleasure. If the\r\nEnglish army is defeated, then India is lost to Great Britain; for the\r\nEnglish are, in India, in the enemy’s country; as a defeated people they\r\nwill find no support in the Indian people. They would be attacked on all\r\nsides by the Indian native chieftains, whose independence they have so\r\nbrutally destroyed, at the very moment that their power is broken. We,\r\non the other hand, should be received with open arms, as rescuers of the\r\nIndian people from their intolerable yoke. The Anglo-Indian army looks\r\non paper much more formidable than it really is; its strength is put at\r\n200,000 men, yet only one-third of this number are English soldiers, the\r\nrest being composed of natives. This army, moreover, consists of four\r\ndivisions, which are scattered over the whole great territory of India.\r\nA field army, for employment on the frontier or across it, cannot\r\npossibly consist of more than 60,000 men; for, considering the\r\nuntrustworthiness of the population, the land cannot be denuded of its\r\ngarrisons. As a result of what I have said, I record my conviction that\r\nthe war will have to be waged in India itself, and that God will give us\r\nthe victory.”\r\n\r\nThe words of the General, spoken in an energetic and confident tone,\r\nmade a deep impression upon his hearers; only respect for the presence\r\nof the Grand Dukes prevented applause. The greyhaired President gave the\r\nMinister of War his hand, and invited the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nto address them.\r\n\r\n“In my opinion,” said the diplomatist, “there is no doubt that the\r\nstrategical opinions just delivered by His Excellency the Minister\r\nfor War are based upon an expert’s sound and correct estimate of the\r\ncircumstances, and I also am certain that the troops of His Majesty the\r\nTsar, accustomed as they are to victory, will, in the event of war, soon\r\nbe standing upon the plain of the Indus. It is also my firm conviction\r\nthat Russia would be best advised to take the offensive as soon as\r\never the impossibility of our present relations to England has been\r\ndemonstrated. But whoever goes to war with England must not look to one\r\nbattleground alone. On the contrary, we must be prepared for attacks of\r\nthe most varied kinds, for an attack upon our finances, to begin with,\r\nand upon our credit, as to which His Excellency Witte could give better\r\ninformation than I could. The Bank of England, and the great banking\r\nfirms allied with it, would at once open this financial campaign.\r\nMoreover, a ship sailing under the Russian flag would hardly dare show\r\nitself on the open seas, and our international trade would, until our\r\nenemy had been crushed, be absolutely at a standstill. Moreover, more\r\nvital for us than considerations of this sort would be the question:\r\nWhat of the attitude of the other great Powers? England’s political\r\nart has, since the days of Oliver Cromwell, displayed itself chiefly in\r\nadroitly making use of the continental Powers. It is no exaggeration to\r\nsay that England’s wars have been chiefly waged with continental armies.\r\nThis is not said in depreciation of England’s military powers. Wherever\r\nthe English fleet and English armies have been seen on the field of\r\nbattle, the energy, endurance, and intrepidity of their officers,\r\nsailors, and soldiers have ever been brilliantly noticeable. The\r\ntraditions of the English troops who, under the Black Prince and Henry\r\nV., marched in days of yore victorious through France, were again\r\ngreen in the wars in the eighteenth century against France and against\r\nNapoleon. Yet infinitely greater than her own military record has been\r\nEngland’s success in persuading foreign countries to fight for her, and\r\nin leading the troops of Austria, France, Germany, and Russia against\r\neach other on the Continent. For the last two hundred years very few\r\nwars have ever been waged without England’s co-operation, and without\r\nher reaping the advantage. These few exceptions were the wars of\r\nBismarck, waged for the advantage and for the glory of his own country,\r\nby which he earned the hatred of every good Englishman. While the\r\ncontinent of Europe was racked by internal wars, which English diplomacy\r\nhad incited, Great Britain acquired her vast colonial possessions.\r\nEngland has implicated us too in wars which redounded to her sole\r\nadvantage. I need only refer to the bloody, exhausting war of 1877-8,\r\nand to the disastrous peace of San Stefano, where England’s intrigues\r\ndeprived us of the price of our victory over the Crescent. I refer,\r\nfurther, to the Crimean War, in which a small English and a large French\r\narmy defeated us to the profit and advantage of England. That England,\r\nand England alone, is again behind this attack upon us by Japan has been\r\ndwelt upon by those who have already addressed you. Our enemies do not\r\nsee themselves called upon to depart in the slightest degree from a\r\npolicy that has so long stood them in such good stead, and it must,\r\ntherefore, be our policy to assure ourselves of the alliance, or at\r\nleast, where an alliance is unattainable, of the benevolent neutrality\r\nof the other continental Powers in view of a war with England. To begin\r\nwith, as regards our ally, the French Republic, a satisfactory solution\r\nof our task in this direction is already assured by the existing\r\ntreaties. Yet these treaties do not bind the French Government to\r\nafford us military support in the case of a war which, in the eyes of\r\nshortsighted observers, might perhaps be regarded as one which we had\r\nourselves provoked. We have accordingly opened negotiations through our\r\nAmbassador with M. Delcasse, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nand with the President of the Republic himself. I have the supreme\r\nsatisfaction of being in a position to lay before you the result of\r\nthese negotiations in the form of a despatch just received from our\r\nAmbassador in Paris. It runs, in the main, as follows: ‘I hasten to\r\ninform Your Excellency that, in the name of the French Republic, M.\r\nDelcasse has given me the solemn assurance that France will declare war\r\nupon England at the moment His Majesty the Tsar has directed his armies\r\nto march upon India. The considerations which have prompted the French\r\nGovernment to take this step have been further explained to me by\r\nM. Delcasse in our conference of this day, when he expressed himself\r\nsomewhat as follows: ‘Napoleon, a hundred years ago, perceived with rare\r\ndiscernment that England was the real enemy of all continental nations,\r\nand that the European continent could not pursue any other policy but to\r\ncombine in resisting that great pirate. The magnificent plan of Napoleon\r\nwas the alliance of France with Spain, Italy, Austria, Germany, and\r\nRussia, in order to combat the rapacity of England. And he would, in\r\nall probability, have carried his scheme through had it not been that\r\nconsiderations of domestic policy determined the Tsar Alexander I., in\r\nspite of his admiration for Napoleon’s ability, to run counter to the\r\nlatter’s intentions. The consequences of Napoleon’s defeat have shown\r\nthemselves sufficiently clearly during the past hundred years in\r\nthe enormous growth of the English power. The present political\r\nconstellation, which in many respects is very similar to that of the\r\nyear 1804, should be utilised to revive Napoleon’s plan once more.\r\nRussia has, of course, the first and most vital interest in the downfall\r\nof England, for, so long as Great Britain controls all the seas and all\r\nthe important coastlines, it is like a giant whose hands and feet are\r\nfettered. Yet France is also checked in her natural development. Her\r\nflourishing colonies in America and the Atlantic Ocean were wrested\r\nfrom her in the eighteenth century. She was ousted by this overpowering\r\nadversary from her settlements in the East Indies and--what the French\r\nnation feels perhaps most acutely--Egypt, purchased for France by\r\nthe great Napoleon with the blood of his soldiers, was weaned away\r\nby English gold and English intrigues. The Suez Canal, built by a\r\nFrenchman, Lesseps, is in the possession of the English, facilitating\r\ntheir communications with India, and securing them the sovereignty of\r\nthe world. France will accordingly make certain stipulations as the\r\nprice of its alliance--stipulations which are so loyal and equitable\r\nthat there is no question whatever of their not being agreed to on\r\nthe part of her ally, Russia. France demands that her possessions in\r\nTonking, Cochin China, Cambodia, Annam, and Laos shall be guaranteed;\r\nthat Russia be instrumental in assisting her to acquire Egypt, and that\r\nit pledge itself to support the French policy in Tunis and the rest of\r\nAfrica.” In accordance with my instructions, I felt myself empowered\r\nto assure M. Delcasse that his conditions were accepted on our side. In\r\nanswer to my question, whether a war with England would be popular in\r\nFrance, the Minister said: “The French people will be ready for any\r\nsacrifice if we make Fashoda our war-cry. British insolence never\r\nshowed itself more brutal and insulting than over this affair. Our brave\r\nMarchand was on the spot with a superior force, and France was within\r\nher rights. The simple demand of an English officer, who possessed\r\nno other force but the moral one of the English flag, compelled us,\r\nhowever, under the political circumstances which then obtained, to\r\nabandon our righteous claims, and to recall our brave leader. How the\r\nFrench people viewed this defeat has been plainly seen. The Parisians\r\ngave Marchand a splendid ovation as a national hero, and the French\r\nGovernment seriously contemplated the possibility of a revolution. We\r\nare now in a position to take revenge for the humiliation which we then\r\nendured, probably out of excessive prudence. If we inscribe the word\r\nFASHODA on the tricolour there will not be in the whole of France a man\r\ncapable of bearing arms who will not follow our lead with enthusiasm.”\r\n It appeared to me to be politic to assure myself whether the Government\r\nor the inspired press would not perhaps promise the people the recovery\r\nof Alsace-Lorraine as the price of a victorious issue of the war. But\r\nthe Minister replied decidedly, “No. The question of Alsace-Lorraine,”\r\n he declared, “must remain outside our view as soon as we make up our\r\nminds to go in for practical politics. Nothing could possibly be more\r\nfatal than to rouse bad blood in Germany. For the German Emperor is the\r\ntongue of the balance in which the destinies of the world are weighed.\r\nEngland in her own esteem has nothing to fear from him. She regards him\r\nmore as an Englishman than a German. Her confidence in this respect must\r\nnot be disturbed; it forms one of the props on which British arrogance\r\nsupports itself. The everlasting assurances of the German Emperor, that\r\nhe intends peace and nothing but peace, appear, of course, to confirm\r\nthe correctness of this view. But I am certain that the Emperor\r\nWilliam’s love of peace has its limits where the welfare and the\r\nsecurity of Germany are seriously jeopardised. In spite of his impulsive\r\ntemperament, he is not the ruler to allow himself to be influenced\r\nby every expression of popular clamour, and to be driven by every\r\nebullition of public feeling, to embark on a decisive course of action.\r\nBut he is far-seeing enough to discern at the right moment a real\r\ndanger, and to meet it with the whole force of his personality. I do\r\nnot, therefore, look upon the hope of gaining him for an ally as a\r\nUtopian dream, and I trust that Russian diplomacy will join with ours\r\nin bringing this alliance about. A war with England without Germany’s\r\nsupport would always be a hazardous enterprise. Of course we are\r\nprepared to embark upon such a war, alike for our friendship with Russia\r\nand for the sake of our national honour, but we could only promise\r\nourselves a successful issue if all the continental great Powers join\r\nhands in this momentous undertaking.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the fact of an offensive and defensive alliance with France in\r\nview of a war with England could not have been unknown to the majority\r\nof the assembled company, yet the reading of this despatch, which\r\nwas followed with breathless attention, evidently produced a deep\r\nimpression. Its publication left no room for doubt that this war\r\nhad been resolved on in the highest quarters, and although no loud\r\nmanifestation of applause followed its reading, the illustrious\r\nassemblage now breathed freely, and almost all faces wore an expression\r\nof joyous satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOnly one man, with knitted brows, regarded the scene with serious\r\ndisapproval. For decades past he had been regarded as the most\r\ninfluential man in Russia--as a power, in fact, who had constantly\r\nthwarted the plans of the leading statesmen and had carried his opinions\r\nthrough with unswerving energy.\r\n\r\nThis solitary malcontent was Pobiedonostsev, the Chief Procurator of the\r\nHoly Synod, who, despite his grey hairs, was detested only less than he\r\nwas feared.\r\n\r\nHis gloomy mien and his shake of the head had not escaped the presiding\r\nGrand Duke, and the latter evidently considered it to be his duty to\r\ngive this man who had enjoyed the confidence of three successive Tsars\r\nan opportunity of recording his divergent opinion.\r\n\r\nAt his summons the Chief Procurator arose, and, amid complete silence,\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n“It cannot be my duty to deliver an opinion as to the possibility or on\r\nthe prospects of an alliance with Germany, for I am as little acquainted\r\nas any here present with the intentions and plans of the German Emperor.\r\nWilliam II. is the greatest sphinx of our age. He talks much, and his\r\nspeeches give the impression of complete sincerity; but who can guess\r\nwhat is really behind them? That he has formulated a fixed programme\r\nas his life’s work, and that he is the man to carry it out, regardless\r\nwhether public opinion is on his side or not, thus much appears to me\r\nto be certain. If the subjection of England is a part of his programme,\r\nthen the hopes of the French Minister would, in fact, be no Utopia,\r\nonly supposing that the Emperor William considers the present the most\r\nsuitable time for disclosing to the world his ultimate aims. It would\r\nbe the task of our diplomatic representative at the Court of Berlin to\r\nassure himself on this point. But it is quite another question whether\r\nRussia really needs an alliance either with Germany or with the Western\r\nPower just referred to, and my view of the case leads me to answer this\r\nquestion in the negative. Russia is, at the present time, the last and\r\nsole bulwark of absolutism in Europe, and if a ruler called by God’s\r\ngrace to the highest and most responsible of all earthly offices is to\r\nremain strong enough to crush the spirit of rebellion and immorality\r\nwhich here and there, under the influence of foreign elements, has shown\r\nitself in our beloved country, we must, before all things, take heed to\r\nkeep far away from our people the poison of the so-called liberal ideas,\r\ninfidelity, and atheism with which it seems likely to be contaminated\r\nfrom the West. In like manner, as we, a century ago, crushed the\r\npowerful leader of the revolution, so also shall we to-day triumph\r\nover our foe--we single-handed! Let our armies march into Persia,\r\nAfghanistan, and India, and lead throughout all Asia the dominion of the\r\ntrue faith to victory. But keep our holy Russia uncontaminated by the\r\npoison of that heretical spirit, which would be a worse foe than any\r\nforeign power can be.”\r\n\r\nHe sat down, and for a moment absolute silence reigned. The Grand Duke\r\nmade a serious face, and exchanged a few whispered words with both his\r\nnephews.\r\n\r\nThen he said: “All the gentlemen who have here given us their views on\r\nthe situation are agreed that a declaration of war upon England is\r\nan exceedingly lamentable but, under the circumstances, unavoidable\r\nnecessity; yet before I communicate to His Majesty, our gracious\r\nLord, this view, which is that of us all, I put to you, gentlemen, the\r\nquestion whether there is anyone here who is of a contrary opinion. In\r\nthis case, I would beg of him to address us.”\r\n\r\nHe waited a short while, but as no one wished to be allowed to speak, he\r\nrose from his chair, and with a few words of thanks and a gentle bow to\r\nthe dignitaries, who had also risen in their places, notified that\r\nhe regarded the sitting, fraught with momentous consequences for the\r\ndestiny of the world, as closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE OFFICERS’ MESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place was Chanidigot, in British East India. The blinding brightness\r\nof the hot day had been immediately followed, almost without the\r\ntransition to twilight, by the darkness of evening, which brought with\r\nit a refreshing coolness, allowing all living things to breathe again\r\nfreely. In the wide plain, which served as the encampment ground for the\r\nEnglish regiment of lancers, all was alive again with the setting of\r\nthe sun. The soldiers, freed from the toil of duty, enjoyed themselves,\r\naccording to their ideas and dispositions, either in playing cards,\r\nsinging, or merrily drinking. The large tent, used as a messroom by the\r\nofficers, also showed signs of life. Dinner was over, and a number of\r\ngentlemen sat down to a game of cards, as was their daily custom. But\r\nhere the amusement was of a less harmless character than in the case of\r\nthe private soldiers. For not innocent bridge, but “poker” was the order\r\nof the day, a game much affected in America and also in some parts of\r\nEngland, a game which is solely determined by chance together with a\r\ncertain histrionic bluffing on the part of the players, and the stakes\r\nwere rather high. It was mostly played by the younger gentlemen, who\r\ncould not do without their nerve-tonic in the evenings, in the monotony\r\nof camp life. The older men sat apart at tables, talking and drinking\r\nwhisky-and-soda, and smoking their short pipes. Amongst them there was\r\nalso a gentleman in civilian dress. The hospitality with which he was\r\ntreated showed that he was not one of the officers of the regiment,\r\nbut their guest. The sound of his name--he was addressed as Mr.\r\nHeideck--would have betrayed his German origin, even had his appearance\r\nnot proclaimed it. He was of but medium height, but athletic in build.\r\nHis erect, soldiery bearing and the elasticity of his movements plainly\r\nbetokened his excellent health and considerable bodily strength. A\r\nforeigner can hardly present better credentials to an Englishman\r\nthan these qualities. Perhaps, more than anything else, it was his\r\ndistinguished appearance, in conjunction with his amiable and thoroughly\r\ngentlemanly bearing, that had so quickly opened the usually very\r\nexclusive officers’ circle to the young German, with his clever,\r\nenergetic features, and his honest blue eyes.\r\n\r\nJudged by his profession he did not, perhaps, belong to their society,\r\naccording to the ideas of some of these gentlemen. It was known that he\r\nwas travelling for a large commercial house in Hamburg. His uncle,\r\nthe head of the house, imported indigo. And since the Maharajah of\r\nChanidigot was the owner of very extensive indigo fields, young Heideck\r\nhad been detained here a whole fortnight by commercial negotiations with\r\nthe prince. He had succeeded, during this time, in gaining the lively\r\nsympathies of all, but particularly of the older British officers. In\r\nIndian garrisons every European is welcome. Heideck was also invited to\r\nthose social functions at which the ladies of the regiment were present.\r\n\r\nHe had always refused an invitation to cards with polite firmness, and\r\nto-day also he was at most an uninterested and unconcerned spectator.\r\n\r\nPresently the door of the tent opened and a tall, but extremely slim\r\nofficer joined the circle of his comrades, jingling his spurs with a\r\nself-conscious, almost haughty attitude. He was in undress uniform and\r\ntalked to one of the gentlemen, who addressed him as Captain Irwin,\r\nabout just returning from a fatiguing ride for the inspection of\r\nan outpost. He demanded from one of the orderlies in attendance a\r\nrefreshing drink, the favourite whisky-and-soda, then he drew close to\r\nthe gaming-table.\r\n\r\n“Room for a little one?” he asked. And place was readily made for him.\r\n\r\nFor a little while the game of poker went on in the same quiet way as\r\nbefore. But suddenly something extraordinary must have happened. All the\r\ngentlemen, except Captain Irwin and one of the players, laid down their\r\ncards, and the unpleasantly penetrating voice of Captain Irwin was\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n“You are an old fox, Captain McGregor! But I am aware of your tricks and\r\ncannot be taken in by them. Therefore, once more, six hundred rupees!”\r\n\r\nEvery poker-player knows that, so far from being considered\r\ndishonourable, it is a chief sign of skill in the game, where each man\r\nplays for his own hand, for one to deceive the rest as to the value of\r\nthe cards he holds. The name of “bluff,” which has been given to this\r\ngame, is itself sufficient to show that everyone has to try his best to\r\npuzzle his adversaries.\r\n\r\nBut this time Irwin appeared to have met his match in McGregor. For the\r\nCaptain replied calmly: “Six hundred and fifty. But I advise you not to\r\nsee me, Irwin.”\r\n\r\n“Seven hundred.”\r\n\r\n“Seven hundred and fifty.”\r\n\r\n“Thousand!” shouted Irwin with resounding voice, and leant back in his\r\nchair smiling, as if certain of victory.\r\n\r\n“You had better consider what you are about,” said McGregor. “I have\r\ngiven you warning.”\r\n\r\n“A convenient way to haul in seven hundred and fifty rupees. I repeat: A\r\nthousand rupees.”\r\n\r\n“One thousand and fifty!”\r\n\r\n“Two thousand!”\r\n\r\nAll the gentlemen present in the tent had risen and stood round the two\r\nplayers, who, their cards concealed in their hands, watched each other\r\nwith sharp glances. Hermann Heideck, who had stepped behind Irwin,\r\nnoticed on the right hand of the Captain a magnificent diamond ring. But\r\nhe also perceived, by the way the bright sparkle of the stone quivered,\r\nhow the gambler’s fingers trembled.\r\n\r\nCaptain McGregor turned to his companions. “I take the gentlemen to\r\nwitness that I have advised my comrade Irwin not to see me at six\r\nhundred.”\r\n\r\n“To the devil with your advice!” Irwin interrupted almost furiously. “Am\r\nI a boy? Will you see me at two thousand, McGregor, or will you not?”\r\n\r\n“Very well, since you insist upon it--three thousand.”\r\n\r\n“Five thousand.”\r\n\r\n“Five thousand five hundred.”\r\n\r\n“Ten thousand.”\r\n\r\nOne of the higher officers, Major Robertson, laid his hand lightly upon\r\nthe shoulder of the rash gambler.\r\n\r\n“That is too much, Irwin. I do not care to interfere in these things,\r\nand since you do not belong to my regiment, I can only speak to you as a\r\ncomrade, not as a superior. But I am afraid you will be in difficulties\r\nif you lose.”\r\n\r\nAngrily the Captain fired up--\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by that, sir? If your words are intended to express a\r\ndoubt as to my solvency--”\r\n\r\n“Well! well--I did not mean to offend you. After all, you must know best\r\nyourself what you are justified in doing.”\r\n\r\nIrwin repeated with a defiant air--\r\n\r\n“Ten thousand! I am waiting for your answer, McGregor.”\r\n\r\nThe adversary remained as calm as before.\r\n\r\n“Ten thousand five hundred.”\r\n\r\n“Twenty thousand!”\r\n\r\n“Are you drunk, Irwin?” whispered the young Lieutenant Temple into the\r\nCaptain’s ear, from the other side. But he only glanced round with a\r\nfurious look.\r\n\r\n“Not more than you. Leave me alone, if you please.”\r\n\r\n“Twenty-one thousand,” came the calm response from the other side of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nA short, awkward pause followed. Captain Irwin nervously gnawed his\r\nsmall dark moustache. Then he raised his slim figure and called out--\r\n\r\n“Fifty thousand!”\r\n\r\nOnce more the Major considered it his duty to endeavour to stop the\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n“I object,” he said. “It has been always a rule that the pool cannot\r\nbe raised by more than a thousand rupees at a time. This limit has long\r\nsince been passed.”\r\n\r\nA rude, hoarse laugh escaped Irwin’s lips.\r\n\r\n“It appears you want to save me, Major. But I am not in need of any\r\nsaviour. If I lose I pay, and I don’t understand why the gentlemen are\r\nso concerned on my behalf.”\r\n\r\nThe Major, who at last saw that all his good endeavours were misplaced,\r\nshrugged his shoulders. Lieutenant Temple, however, thought he had\r\na good idea, and with an apparently unintentional, though violent,\r\nmovement pushed against the light camp-table, and sent ashtrays,\r\nbottles, glasses, and cards flying on the ground. But he did not gain\r\nanything by this, for the two players held their cards firmly in their\r\nhands, and did not allow this contretemps to disturb their sangfroid for\r\na single moment.\r\n\r\n“Fifty-one,” said McGregor.\r\n\r\n“Sixty.”\r\n\r\n“Sixty-one.”\r\n\r\n“Seventy.”\r\n\r\n“Seventy-one.”\r\n\r\n“Eighty.”\r\n\r\n“Eighty-one.”\r\n\r\n“A lakh!” cried Irwin, who was now pale from excitement.\r\n\r\n“Really?” asked McGregor calmly, “that is a fine bid. A lakh--that is,\r\nreckoned at the present rate of exchange, 6,500 pounds sterling. You\r\nwill be a wealthy man, Irwin, if you win. Now, then, I see you.”\r\n\r\nWith trembling fingers, but with a triumphant look, the Captain laid\r\ndown his cards.\r\n\r\n“Straight flush,” he said hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Yes, a strong hand,” replied the other, smiling. “But which is your\r\nhighest card?”\r\n\r\n“The king, as you see for yourself.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a pity, for I have also, as it happens, a straight flush, but\r\nmine is up to the ace.”\r\n\r\nSlowly, one after the other, he laid down his cards--ace of hearts, king\r\nof hearts, queen of hearts, knave of hearts, ten of hearts. One single\r\nexclamation of surprise came from the lips of the bystanders. None of\r\nthem had ever seen the coincidence of such an extraordinary sequence.\r\n\r\nCaptain Irwin sat motionless for a moment, fixing his unsteady eyes\r\nstraight upon his adversary’s cards. Then he suddenly sprang up with a\r\nwild laugh, and left the tent with jingling steps.\r\n\r\n“This loss spells ruin for Irwin,” said the Major gravely. “He is not in\r\na position to pay such a sum.”\r\n\r\n“With his wife’s assistance he could,” chimed in another; “but it would\r\neat up pretty well the rest of her fortune.”\r\n\r\n“I call you, gentlemen, to witness that it is not my fault,” said\r\nMcGregor, who thought he perceived a certain degree of reproach in the\r\nfaces of the bystanders; but all agreed with him.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Temple, who alone of all those present kept up a certain\r\nsuperficial friendship with Irwin, remarked, “Somebody must go after him\r\nto see that he does not do something foolish in his first excitement.”\r\n\r\nHe turned as if to leave the room, but a call from McGregor stopped him.\r\n\r\n“It will be no use, Temple, unless you are able to calm him in some\r\nway or other. In my opinion there is only one thing to do. He must be\r\npersuaded that the whole affair is only a joke, and that the cards had\r\nbeen shuffled beforehand.”\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant went back to the table.\r\n\r\n“The suggestion of this way of putting it does you honour, Captain; only\r\nI have my doubts if any of us would have the courage to go to him with\r\nthis manifest lie.”\r\n\r\nThe silence of the others appeared to confirm this doubt, when the\r\ndecisive voice of the German guest interrupted with--\r\n\r\n“Will you entrust me, gentlemen, with this mission? I know Captain Irwin\r\nonly slightly, it is true, and should have no reason to interfere with\r\nhis private concerns; but I hear that it is his wife’s property which\r\nhas been at stake here, and as I consider Mrs. Irwin a very honourable\r\nlady I would gladly do my best to save her from such a heavy pecuniary\r\nloss.”\r\n\r\nMcGregor held out his hand.\r\n\r\n“You would place me under a great obligation, Mr. Heideck, if you could\r\nsucceed in this matter, but I warn you that there is no time to lose.”\r\n\r\nHeideck quickly left the tent, but when he had come out into the\r\ndelicious moonlight night the first thing that met his eye was Captain\r\nIrwin, some twenty yards distant, standing by his horse. The servant\r\nheld the animal by the bridle, and Captain Irwin was about to mount. On\r\ncoming nearer he saw the servant move off and perceived that Irwin held\r\na revolver in his hand. With a quick motion he seized the officer’s\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\n“One moment, Captain Irwin.”\r\n\r\nIrwin started, turned round, and looked with fury at Heideck.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” said the German, “but you are labouring under a\r\nmistake, Captain. The game was all a jest; they were playing a trick\r\nupon you. The cards were arranged beforehand.”\r\n\r\nIrwin made no reply, but whistled to his servant and went back into the\r\ntent, revolver still in hand, without a single word to Heideck. Heideck\r\nfollowed. Both gentlemen stepped up to the card-table, and Irwin turned\r\nto McGregor.\r\n\r\n“You tell me the game was all a got-up thing, do you?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“As a lesson to you, Irwin--you who always plunge as a madman, and\r\nimagine yourself a good player, when you have not the necessary cold\r\nblood for gambling.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Irwin, “that is a story that I will take care goes the\r\nround of all the garrisons in India, as an instance of kind comrade-like\r\nfeeling, so that everyone may be warned against coming along here and\r\nbeing induced to take a hand. I never in my life came across a more\r\ndespicable story; but it certainly is a lesson for me, that only\r\nhonourable persons should be--”\r\n\r\n“No, Captain Irwin,” said McGregor, standing bolt upright, levelling\r\nat his insulter a withering look from his great blue eyes, “you should\r\nrather think of your poor wife, whom you would have made a pauper if\r\nthis game had not been all a hoax.”\r\n\r\nIrwin reeled back; the revolver fell from his grasp.\r\n\r\n“What,” he gasped--“what do you mean? It was, then, no joke, after all.\r\nI, then, really lost the money? Oh, you--you--But what do you take\r\nme for? Be quite certain that I will pay. But,” he cried, collecting\r\nhimself, “I should like to know what the real truth is, after all. I ask\r\nthis question of you all, and call you rogues and liars if you do not\r\ntell me the truth. Have I only really been played with, or has the game\r\nbeen a straightforward one?”\r\n\r\n“Captain Irwin,” replied the Major, advancing towards him, “I, as the\r\nsenior, tell you, in the name of our comrades, that your behaviour would\r\nhave been unpardonable unless a sort of madness had seized you. The\r\ngame was a straightforward one, and only the generosity of Captain\r\nMcGregor--”\r\n\r\nIrwin did not wait for the conclusion of the sentence, but, with a\r\nbound, was again outside the tent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nA RUSSIAN COMRADE\r\n\r\n\r\nHermann Heideck lived in a dak bungalow, one of those hotels kept going\r\nby the Government, which afford travellers shelter, but neither bed nor\r\nfood. On returning home from the camp he found his servant, Morar Gopal,\r\nstanding at the door ready to receive his master, and was informed that\r\na newcomer had arrived with two attendants. As this dak bungalow was\r\nmore roomy than most of the others, the new arrivals were able to find\r\naccommodation, and Heideck was not obliged, as is usual, to make way as\r\nthe earlier guest for a later arrival.\r\n\r\n“What countryman is the gentleman?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“An Englishman, sahib!”\r\n\r\nHeideck entered his room and sat down at the table, upon which,\r\nbesides the two dim candles, stood a bottle of whisky, a few bottles of\r\nsoda-water and the inevitable box of cigarettes. He was moody and in a\r\nbad humour. The exciting scene in the officers’ mess had affected him\r\ngreatly, not on account of Captain Irwin, who, from the first moment\r\nof their acquaintance, was quite unsympathetic to him, but solely on\r\naccount of the beautiful young wife of the frivolous officer, of whom\r\nhe had a lively recollection from their repeated meetings in social\r\ncircles. None of the other officers’ wives--and there were many\r\nbeautiful and amiable women among them--had made such a deep and abiding\r\nimpression upon him as Edith Irwin, whose personal charms had fascinated\r\nhim as much as her extraordinary intellectual powers had astonished\r\nhim. The reflection that this graceful creature was fettered with\r\nindissoluble bonds to a brutal and dissolute fellow of Irwin’s stamp,\r\nand that her husband would perhaps one day drag her down with him into\r\ninevitable ruin, awoke in him most painful feelings. He would so gladly\r\nhave done something for the unhappy wife. But he was obliged to admit\r\nthat there was no possibility for him, a stranger, who was nothing to\r\nher but a superficial acquaintance, to achieve anything in the way he\r\nmost desired. The Captain would be completely justified in rejecting\r\nevery uncalled-for interference with his affairs as a piece of monstrous\r\nimpudence; and then, too, in what way could he hope to be of any\r\nassistance?\r\n\r\nA sudden noise in the next room aroused Heideck from his sad reverie. He\r\nheard loud scolding and a clapping sound, as if blows from a whip were\r\nfalling upon a bare human body. A minute later and the door between the\r\nrooms flew open and an Indian, dressed only in cummerbund and turban,\r\nburst into the room, as if intending to seek here protection from his\r\ntormentor. A tall European, dressed entirely in white flannel, followed\r\nat the man’s heels and brought his riding-whip down mercilessly upon the\r\nnaked back of the howling wretch. Heideck’s presence did not, evidently,\r\ndisturb him in the least.\r\n\r\nAt the first glance the young German perceived that his neighbour could\r\nnot be an Englishman, as his servant had told him he was. His strikingly\r\nthin, finely-cut features, and his peculiarly oval, black eyes and\r\nsoft, dark beard betrayed much more the Sarmatic than the characteristic\r\nAnglo-Saxon type.\r\n\r\nThe man’s appearance did not make an unfavourable impression, but he\r\ncould not possibly overlook his behaviour. Stepping between him and his\r\nvictim he demanded, energetically, what this scene meant. The other,\r\nlaughing, let drop the arm which had been again raised to strike.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, sir,” he said with a foreign accent, “a very good\r\nboy, but he steals like a crow, and must have the whip occasionally. I\r\nam sure that he has concealed somewhere about him the five rupees\r\nwhich have been stolen from me again to-day.” On saying this, as if\r\nhe considered this information quite sufficient explanation, he again\r\ncaught hold of the black fellow, and with a single wrench tore the\r\nturban from his head. From the white, red-bordered cloth a few pieces of\r\nsilver fell and rolled jingling over the tiles; and at the same time a\r\nlarger object fell at Heideck’s feet. He picked it up and held in\r\nhis hand a gold cigarette-case, the lid of which was engraved with a\r\nprince’s coronet. On handing it to the stranger, the latter bowed his\r\nthanks and made his apologies like a man of good breeding. The Indian\r\nthe while took the opportunity, in a few monkey-like bounds, to make\r\ngood his escape. The sight of the coat-of-arms on the cigarette-case\r\naroused in Heideck the desire to make nearer acquaintance with his\r\nimpetuous neighbour. As though he had quite forgotten the extraordinary\r\nmanner of his entrance into the room, he asked, blandly, if he might\r\ninvite his neighbour, whom accident had thus thrust upon him, to a cigar\r\nand a “nightcap.”\r\n\r\nThe other accepted the invitation with amiable alacrity. “You are also\r\na commercial traveller, sir?” inquired Heideck; and on receiving\r\nan affirmative answer, continued, “we are then colleagues. Are you\r\nsatisfied with your results here?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, things might be better. There is too much competition.”\r\n\r\n“Cotton?”\r\n\r\n“No. Bronze goods and silk. Have brought some marvellous gold ornaments\r\nfrom Delhi.”\r\n\r\n“Then probably your cigarette-case comes from Delhi also?” The oval eyes\r\nof the other shot over him in an inquiring glance.\r\n\r\n“My cigarette-case? No--are you travelling perhaps in skins, colleague?\r\nDo you deal in Cashmir goats?”\r\n\r\n“I have everything. My house trades in everything.”\r\n\r\n“You do not come from Calcutta?”\r\n\r\n“No! not from Calcutta.”\r\n\r\n“Bad weather down there. All my leather is spoilt.”\r\n\r\n“Is it so damp there?”\r\n\r\n“Vapour bath, I tell you; a real vapour bath!”\r\n\r\nHeideck had long since made up his mind that he had a Russian before\r\nhim. But, in order to be quite on the safe side, he made a jocular\r\nremark in Russian. His new acquaintance looked up astonished.\r\n\r\n“You speak Russian, sir?”\r\n\r\n“A little.”\r\n\r\n“But you are no Russian?”\r\n\r\n“No; I am a German, who, during a temporary stay in Russia, have picked\r\nup a little knowledge of languages. We merchants go about a lot.”\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who, according to his statement, travelled in bronze\r\nand silk was evidently delighted to hear in a place where he had least\r\nexpected it the familiar tones of his mother tongue, and Heideck did his\r\nutmost, with almost an excess of zeal, to keep him in good humour. He\r\ncalled his servant and bade him get some hot water.\r\n\r\n“It’s quite chilly to-night,” he said, turning to his guest. “A hot\r\nbrandy-and-water is not to be despised.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said the Russian, “stop a moment; better chuck the water away and\r\nlet something more palatable take its place.”\r\n\r\nHe went into his room and returned immediately with a bottle of sherry\r\nand two bottles of champagne.\r\n\r\n“I will, with your permission, brew in this kettle a bowl in Russian\r\nfashion. Sugar must go in too; for this champagne, prepared for English\r\ntaste, is too dry, and must be sweetened to make it palatable for us.”\r\n He poured the bottle of cognac, which the servant had brought, together\r\nwith the sherry into the champagne and filled the glasses.\r\n\r\nIn German fashion the two gentlemen touched glasses. As they did so,\r\nHeideck once more attentively observed his new acquaintance. The lurking\r\nexpression with which he felt that the eyes of the other were fixed upon\r\nhim made him start for a moment. What if the Russian perhaps only had\r\nthe same intention as himself, and only wanted to make his tongue wag\r\nwith the champagne? At all events, he was now on his guard.\r\n\r\n“May I ask you to try one of my Havannah cigars?” asked the Russian in\r\npassing his cigar-case. “The Indian cigars are not bad and very cheap.\r\nThe Beaconsfield is my favourite brand. But now and then one must smoke\r\nsomething else for a change.”\r\n\r\nHeideck accepted with thanks, and now began a fairly good booze, in\r\nwhich the Russian set the example. He was, however, evidently not so\r\nproof against the effects of the tasty and strong drink as was the\r\nGerman. With each minute he became more loquacious, and soon began to\r\naddress his new friend as “Dear old chap,” and to narrate all manner of\r\nmore or less compromising stories. He also, induced by several adroit\r\nquestions on the part of Heideck, began to prate of his family affairs.\r\nHe mocked at an old aunt of his, who was wont to cover her hair with\r\nroses the better to conceal bald spots, and added that this aunt was a\r\ngreat favourite at the Court of the Tsar, on account of her incomparable\r\ngossiping stories. It apparently never occurred to him that such\r\nintimate family relations were a rather strange subject for conversation\r\nin a commercial traveller.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his conversation he mentioned that not long before he\r\nhad been in China.\r\n\r\n“We are too slow, dear chap, much too slow,” he declared; “with fifty\r\nthousand men we could take all that we want, and we ought to have\r\nattacked those Japanese long since.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, then,” said Heideck, with apparent indifference, “how strong\r\nreally is the army of the Governor-General of Turkestan?”\r\n\r\nThe Russian looked up, but it was not because he was thinking what\r\nanswer to give; for, after having tossed off a glass of soda-water, he\r\nreplied--\r\n\r\n“If you want to live well, my dear fellow, you must go to Manchuria.\r\nSalmon, I tell you--ah! and they cost next to nothing--and pretty girls\r\nin abundance! You can buy furs, too, for next to nothing at all. What\r\ncosts in St. Petersburg ten thousand rubles, you can get in China, up\r\nthere in the north, for a hundred.”\r\n\r\n“Then of course you have brought some beautiful furs with you?”\r\n\r\n“Furs in India? they would be eaten by the ants in a second. For my\r\nown personal use, I have certainly brought one with me, which in St.\r\nPetersburg would be worth, at the least, five thousand rubles. I shall\r\nhave use enough for it later on, in the mountains. You can smell it a\r\nmile away, it has been pickled so well.”\r\n\r\nAgain there was a short pause, and then after gazing intently at his\r\nvis-a-vis, Heideck suddenly said--\r\n\r\n“You are an officer?”\r\n\r\nWithout being able to collect himself the Russian stared into his face.\r\n\r\n“Let us be candid with each other,” he rejoined, after long reflection.\r\n“You are also a soldier, sir?”\r\n\r\n“I need not deny it in reply to a comrade. My name is Captain Hermann\r\nHeideck of the Prussian General Staff.”\r\n\r\nThe Russian rose and made a correct bow. “And my name is Prince Fedor\r\nAndreievitch Tchajawadse, Captain in the Preobraschensky regiment of the\r\nGuards.”\r\n\r\nThey then once more touched glasses: “To ourselves as good comrades”\r\n rang their mutual toast.\r\n\r\n“Comrade, I will tell you something,” said the Russian. “General Ivanov\r\nis on the march towards the Indian frontier. The Tsar has given up his\r\ntheosophy; he intends to declare war upon England.”\r\n\r\nHeideck would have wished to learn more, but the Prince had addressed\r\nhimself to the good liquor somewhat more than his head could stand, and\r\nhe began to sing indecent French chansons, only to pass of a sudden\r\nto melancholy Russian popular songs. In his present condition it was\r\nimpossible to think of continuing a sensible conversation with him\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nHeideck already found himself somewhat perplexed what to do with his\r\nintoxicated guest, when a new surprise was sprung upon him. The door\r\nto the next room opened and a tall, handsome young fellow, of at most\r\neighteen years, appeared on the threshold.\r\n\r\nHe was garbed in a sort of fantastic page’s dress, which in any other\r\ncountry but that of rainbow-hued picturesque India would have looked\r\nlike that of a masquerader. The blue gold-embroidered jacket was girded\r\nwith a red silk scarf, and the loose red trousers disappeared at the\r\nknees in patent leather topboots, the elegant shape of which showed\r\nthe contour of the smallest of feet. Thick golden locks fell like waves\r\nalmost down to the shoulders of the boyish youth. The handsome oval face\r\nhad the complexion of a blushing rose; the great, blue eyes, however,\r\nshowed the energy of a strong will.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Prince had set eyes on the young visitor, he stopped\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Georgi?” he stammered.\r\n\r\nWithout uttering a syllable, the page had advanced towards him, and had\r\nquickly raised the intoxicated man from the chair. Prince Tchajawadse\r\nflung his arm round the boy’s shoulders, and without bidding his German\r\ncomrade as much as “good night,” allowed himself to be led away.\r\n\r\nHeideck did not doubt for a moment that this slender page was a girl\r\nin disguise. The splendid build and the strange expression of untamed\r\nenergy in the admirably regular features were the unmistakable\r\ncharacteristics of the Circassian type. This so-called Georgi could be\r\nnone other but a child of the Caucasian Mountains; and Tchajawadse also,\r\nas his name showed, was a scion of those old Caucasian dynastic houses\r\nwhich in days of yore had played a role in that mountain land, which\r\nRussia had so slowly, and with such difficulty, finally subjugated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCASSIAN BEAUTY\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Heideck’s statement that he travelled for a Hamburg firm was\r\nnot really an untruth. As a matter of fact he was engaged in commercial\r\nundertakings, which served as a cloak for the real object of his\r\ntravels.\r\n\r\nHe had been commissioned by the chief of the General Staff to study\r\nthe Indian military organisation, and, in particular, the strategic\r\nimportance of the North-west frontier, and for this purpose unlimited\r\nleave had been granted him.\r\n\r\nBut the General had expressly stated to him--\r\n\r\n“You travel as a private gentleman, and should you come into conflict\r\nwith the English, we shall in no manner accept responsibility for your\r\nactions and adventures. We furnish you with a passport in your own name,\r\nbut, of course, without denoting your military rank. It is also a matter\r\nof course that we should not fail to disclose it in case inquiries are\r\naddressed to us in this regard. In a certain sense you may be said to\r\ntravel at your own risk. Your own tact must be your safest guide.”\r\n\r\nHereupon Heideck entered into correspondence with his uncle, and\r\nreceived from him the necessary letters of introduction to his\r\nIndian agents. He reached the northern provinces by way of Bombay\r\nand Allahabad, visiting on the way all the more important garrison\r\ntowns--Cawnpore, Lucknow, Delhi, and Lahore. After finishing his\r\nbusiness in Chanidigot, his intention was to proceed further north,\r\nmaking his way to Afghanistan by way of the Khyber Pass. It was purely\r\nwith a view to this journey that he had wished to become more intimate\r\nwith the Russian. He was absolutely certain that the Russian had\r\nreceived a commission from his Government similar to his own, and\r\ncertain hints that the Prince had let drop strengthened his opinion that\r\nthe latter intended to take the same route as himself. Accordingly, it\r\ncould only redound to the advantage of the German officer if he joined\r\nhis Russian comrade, who would be in a position to procure him valuable\r\nintroductions when once on Russian territory.\r\n\r\nWhen Heideck woke early the next morning the Prince’s potent bowl of\r\nthe evening before made itself perceptible in various disagreeable after\r\neffects; but the cold bath that Morar Gopal got ready for him, added to\r\na cup of tea, put him on his legs again.\r\n\r\nIt was an Indian morning of dazzling beauty into which he stepped.\r\nFebruary in the Indus Valley in 29 degrees longitude has a temperature\r\nlike that of May in Rome. In the hours of midday the thermometer usually\r\nrises to 100 degrees Fahr.; but the evenings are refreshingly cool, and\r\nthe nights, with their damp fogs, even appreciably chilly.\r\n\r\nHeideck made his toilet on this morning with special care, for he had\r\nbeen invited to a conference with the Minister of the Maharajah, in\r\norder to negotiate with him about some indigo business.\r\n\r\nThe Minister lived in a house on the outskirts of the town. It was a\r\none-story building, with broad airy verandahs, situate in the middle of\r\na large garden. When Heideck arrived, the staircase of the entrance hall\r\nwas occupied by a crowd of divers people waiting to be received. But he,\r\nas a representative of the white race, was saved the tiresome annoyance\r\nof waiting his turn. The porter, dressed in white muslin, and adorned,\r\nas a sign of his office, with a broad red scarf, conducted him at once\r\ninto the Minister’s study, a room furnished in European style.\r\n\r\nIt was only in his outward appearance, namely, his colour and his\r\nfeatures, that the Minister looked like an Indian. Both dress and\r\nmanners were those of a Western diplomatist. Giving Heideck his hand,\r\nhe told him that His Highness himself wished to negotiate with him about\r\nthe indigo business.\r\n\r\n“The price you intend to pay is exceedingly low,” he whispered in a tone\r\nof disapproval.\r\n\r\nHeideck was evidently prepared for this objection.\r\n\r\n“Your Excellency may be right in saying that the price offered is lower\r\nthan in former years; but it is still very high, if the changes which\r\nhave since occurred in the market values are taken into consideration.\r\nIn Germany a substitute has been found in aniline, which is so cheap\r\nthat within a measurable distance of time no indigo whatever will be\r\nbought. If I may be permitted to give His Highness any advice, I would\r\nrecommend him in the future to establish an industry instead of planting\r\nindigo.”\r\n\r\n“And which, may I ask, are you thinking of?”\r\n\r\n“Oil mills and cotton mills would appear to me to be the most\r\nprofitable. You could with them meet both European and Japanese\r\ncompetition.”\r\n\r\nAn Indian servant came with a message, and the Minister invited Heideck\r\nto drive with him to the Maharajah. They entered an open carriage horsed\r\nby two quick Turkestan horses. The yellow uniformed coachman, who had an\r\nextraordinary likeness to a dressed-up monkey, clicked his tongue,\r\nand away they went through spacious grounds to the palace, whose\r\nwhite marble walls soon gleamed through the foliage of the palms and\r\ntamarinds.\r\n\r\nDuring the short drive Heideck pondered on the innumerable battles that\r\nhad seethed over this ground, before English sovereignty had, as\r\nit seemed, stopped for ever all religious struggles, all bloody\r\ninsurrections, and all the incursions of foreign conquerors. Here, on\r\nthis place, where Alexander the Great’s invincible hosts had fought and\r\ndied, where Mohammedans and Hindoos, Afghans and worshippers of the\r\nsun had fought their sanguinary conflicts, works of peace had been\r\nestablished which would endure for generations to come. It was a triumph\r\nof civilisation; and a student of India’s historical past could scarcely\r\nfail to be impressed by it.\r\n\r\nThe Maharajah of Chanidigot was, like the majority of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, a believer in Islam, and the exterior view of his\r\npalace at once betrayed the Mohammedan prince. Away from the main\r\nbuilding, but connected with it by a covered gallery, was a small\r\nwing--the harem, the interior of which was sufficiently guarded from\r\nprying eyes. Here, as in the adornment of the palace, the most splendid\r\nlavishness had been employed. Heideck thought the while with pity on the\r\npoor subjects of the Maharajah whose slavery had to provide the means\r\nfor all this meretricious luxury. The Minister and his companion were\r\nnot conducted into the large audience hall, which was set apart for\r\nspecial functions, but into a loggia on the first floor. Between the\r\ngraceful marble pillars, which supported it, one looked out into\r\nan inner court, which, with exotic plants, afforded an enchanting\r\nspectacle. A gently splashing fountain, springing from a marble basin in\r\nthe centre, cast up a fine spray as high as the loggia and dispersed a\r\nrefreshing coolness.\r\n\r\nThe Minister left him waiting for a considerable time, but then returned\r\nand gave him a mute sign to accompany him to the Prince.\r\n\r\nThe room in which the Maharajah received them was strangely furnished,\r\npresenting to the eyes of a European a not altogether happy combination\r\nof Eastern luxury and English style. Among splendid carpets and precious\r\nweapons, with which the walls were adorned, there hung glaring pictures\r\nof truly barbaric taste--such as in Germany would hardly be met with in\r\nthe house of a fairly well-to-do citizen. Similar incongruities there\r\nwere many, and perhaps the appearance of the Prince himself was the most\r\nincongruous of them all. For this stalwart man with the soft black beard\r\nand penetrating eyes, who in the picturesque attire of his country would\r\ndoubtless have been a handsome and imposing figure, made an inharmonious\r\nimpression in his grey English suit and with the red turban on his head.\r\n\r\nHe sat in an English club chair, covered with red Russia leather and\r\ngently inclined his head in response to Heideck’s deep bow.\r\n\r\nIt did not escape the notice of the German officer that the Maharajah\r\nlooked extremely annoyed, and Heideck concluded that it was the low\r\nprice he had offered for his indigo which had made him so. But the first\r\nwords of the Prince reassured him. “As I learn,” he said in somewhat\r\nbroken English, “you are in fact a European, but no Englishman, and so I\r\nhope to hear the truth from you. I am quite ready to reward you for your\r\ninformation.”\r\n\r\n“I am accustomed to speak the truth, even without reward, Highness!”\r\n\r\nThe Maharajah measured him with a mistrustful look. “I am a true friend\r\nof England,” he continued after a short hesitation, “and am on the best\r\nof terms with the Viceroy; but things are now happening which I cannot\r\npossibly understand. This very morning I received a message from\r\nCalcutta, which absolutely astonished me. The Indian Government intends\r\nto mass an army corps at Quetta, and calls upon me to despatch thither a\r\ncontingent of a thousand infantry, five hundred cavalry, a battery, and\r\ntwo thousand camels. Can you tell me, sir, what makes England mass such\r\na large force at Quetta?”\r\n\r\n“It will only be a precautionary measure, Highness! perhaps disturbances\r\nhave broken out again in Afghanistan.”\r\n\r\n“Disturbances in Afghanistan, do you say? Then Russia must have a hand\r\nin it. Can you perhaps give me more definite information?”\r\n\r\nHeideck had to express his inability to do so, and the Maharajah, who\r\ndid not conceal his vexation, began to open his heart to the stranger in\r\na rather imprudent way.\r\n\r\n“I am a faithful friend of the English, but the burden they lay upon us\r\nis becoming every day more intolerable. If England is bent upon war, why\r\nshould we sacrifice our blood and treasure upon it? Do we not know full\r\nwell what powerful foes England has? You do not belong to this nation,\r\nas my Minister informed me; you are in a position, therefore, to\r\ninstruct me about these matters. It is true I have been in Europe, but\r\nI was not permitted to go beyond London, whither I had proceeded to\r\ncongratulate the late Queen on her birthday. I have seen nothing but\r\nmany, many ships and a gigantic dirty town. Are there not in Europe\r\nstrong and powerful states hostile to England?”\r\n\r\nSuch questions were disagreeable for Heideck to answer, and he therefore\r\npreferred to avoid giving a definite reply.\r\n\r\n“I have been in India for nearly a year,” he replied, “and know about\r\nsuch political matters only what the India Times and other English\r\nnewspapers report. Of course, there is always a certain rivalry among\r\nthe European great Powers, and England has, during the past few decades,\r\nbecome so great that she cannot fail to have enemies; but on this point,\r\nas also on that of the present political situation, I do not venture to\r\nexpress an opinion.”\r\n\r\nThe Maharajah gloomily shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Transact the business with this gentleman in the way you think best,”\r\n he said, turning abruptly to his Minister, a wave of the hand at the\r\nsame time denoting to the young German that the audience was at an end.\r\n\r\nAs Heideck again stepped into the loggia he saw Captain Irwin appear at\r\nthe entrance door in company with an official of the Court. The British\r\nofficer started on perceiving the man who passed for a commercial\r\ntraveller. He cast at him a malicious look, and an almost inimical\r\nreserve lay in the manner with which he returned Heideck’s salutation.\r\nThe latter took little notice, and slowly wended his way through the\r\nextensive park, in whose magnificent old trees monkeys were disporting\r\nthemselves. The Maharajah’s communication to him as to the English\r\norders which he had received, taken in conjunction with General Ivanov’s\r\nadvance, entirely preoccupied him. After this he was no longer in doubt\r\nthat serious military events were impending, or were even then in full\r\nswing. Quetta, in Beluchistan, lying directly on the Afghan frontier,\r\nwas the gate of the line of march towards Kandahar; and if England was\r\nsummoning the Indian princes to its aid the situation could be none\r\nother than critical. War had certainly not yet been declared, but\r\nHeideck’s mission might, under the circumstances, suddenly acquire a\r\npeculiar importance, and it was, at all events, impossible to make at\r\nthis moment any definite plans for the immediate future.\r\n\r\nThe walk to his bungalow in the immediate vicinity of the English camp\r\ntook perhaps an hour, and was sufficient to give him a keen appetite.\r\nHe was not, therefore, at all disappointed to find his Russian comrade\r\nsitting at breakfast in a shady spot before the door of the hotel, and,\r\nheartily returning his salutation, he lost no time in seating himself\r\nat the table. Prince Tchajawadse looked pale, and applied himself to\r\nsoda-water, which, contrary to all established usage, he drank without\r\nthe slightest admixture of whisky. The appetising dish of eggs and bacon\r\nwas standing untouched before him, and he smiled rather sadly when he\r\nsaw what an inroad his guest made upon it.\r\n\r\nThey had hardly exchanged a few commonplace words when two Indian girls\r\nmade their appearance, offering all sorts of nicknacks for sale. The\r\nyounger, whose bare breast glowed like bronze, was of marvellous beauty,\r\neven the paint on her face could not destroy the natural grace of her\r\nfine features. Yet, beautiful as she was, she was as great a coquette.\r\nShe had evidently determined to make an impression on the Russian.\r\nStepping behind his chair, she held her glittering little wares before\r\nhis face. Her manner became more and more intimate. At length she\r\nslipped a golden bracelet on her slender brown wrist and bent, in order\r\nthat he should notice it, so far over his shoulder that her glowing\r\nyoung breast touched his cheek.\r\n\r\nPrince Tchajawadse was of too passionate a temperament to long resist\r\nsuch a temptation. His eyes flashed, and with a rapid movement he turned\r\nround and embraced the girl’s lithe body with his arm.\r\n\r\nA stop was put to further familiarities, however, for this little\r\nadventure, which was very distasteful to Heideck, was suddenly\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nWithout being perceived by those sitting at the table, the handsome\r\nyoung page of the Prince had stepped from the door of the bungalow\r\nwith a plate of bananas and mangoes in his hand. For a few seconds he\r\nregarded with flashing eyes the scene just described, and then, stealing\r\nnearer with noiseless steps, flung, without saying a word, the plate\r\nwith the fruit with such vigour and unerring aim at the dark beauty,\r\nthat the girl, with a loud cry, clasped her hand upon her wounded\r\nshoulder, while the fragments of china fell clattering to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe next moment she and her companion had disappeared in hurried flight.\r\nThe Prince’s face was livid with rage; he sprang up and seized the\r\nriding-whip which lay near him.\r\n\r\nHeideck was on the point of intervening in order to save the disguised\r\ngirl from a similar punishment to that which his new friend had meted\r\nout the day before to his Indian “boy,” but he soon saw that his\r\nintervention was unnecessary.\r\n\r\nStanding bolt upright and with an almost disdainful quiver of his fair\r\nlips, the young page stepped straight up to the Prince. A half-loud\r\nhissing word, the meaning of which Heideck did not understand, must have\r\nsuddenly pacified the wrath of the Russian, for he let his upraised arm\r\nfall and threw the whip on to the table.\r\n\r\n“Go and fetch us another plate of dessert, Georgi,” he said quietly, as\r\nif nothing had happened. “It’s a confounded nuisance, that these Indian\r\nvagabonds don’t allow one a moment’s peace.”\r\n\r\nA triumphant smile played across the face of the Circassian beauty.\r\nShe threw a friendly glance at Heideck and silently returned to the\r\nbungalow. Full of admiration and not without a slight emotion of envy\r\nfor the happy possessor of such an entrancing female beauty, Heideck\r\nfollowed her with his eyes, as she tripped gracefully away with her\r\nlithe graceful figure. A remark was just on the point of passing his\r\nlips, acquainting the Prince that he had discovered the certainly\r\nvery transparent secret of his disguised lady companion, when he was\r\nprevented doing so by a fresh incident.\r\n\r\nAn English soldier in orderly’s uniform stepped up to the table and\r\nhanded Heideck, whom he must have known by sight, with a military\r\nsalute, a letter.\r\n\r\n“From the Colonel,” he said, “and I am ordered to say that the matter is\r\nurgent.”\r\n\r\nWith surprise, Heideck took the missive. It contained in polite, but yet\r\nsomewhat decided terms, a request that Herr Hermann Heideck would\r\nfavour him with a visit as soon as possible. This, considering the\r\nhigh official position that Colonel Baird occupied in Chanidigot, was\r\ntantamount to a command, which he was bound to obey without delay or\r\nfurther excuse.\r\n\r\nBaird was the commander-in-chief of the detachment stationed in\r\nChanidigot, consisting of an infantry regiment, about six hundred\r\nstrong, a lancer regiment of two hundred and forty sabres, and a battery\r\nof field artillery. As in all the other residences of the great Indian\r\nchiefs, the British Government had stationed here also a military force,\r\nstrong enough to keep the Maharajah in respect and to nip all seeds\r\nof insurrection in the bud. As Colonel Baird, moreover, occupied the\r\nposition of Resident at the Court of the Prince, and thus combined all\r\nthe military and diplomatic power in his own person, he had come to be\r\nregarded as the real lord and master in Chanidigot.\r\n\r\nHis bungalow was in the centre of the camp, which lay in the middle of\r\na broad grassy plain. It consisted of a group of buildings which\r\nsurrounded a quadrangular courtyard, adorned with exotics and a\r\nsplashing fountain.\r\n\r\nAs it appeared, he had given orders that Heideck was to be admitted\r\nimmediately on arrival; for the adjutant, to whom he had announced\r\nhimself, conducted him at once into the study of his superior officer.\r\n\r\nQuite politely, though with a frigidity that contrasted with his former\r\nbehaviour towards the popular guest of the officers’ mess, the fine man,\r\nwith his martial carriage, thanked him for his prompt visit.\r\n\r\n“Please be seated, Mr. Heideck,” he began. “I have been very unwilling\r\nto disturb you, but I could not spare you this trouble. I have received\r\nthe intelligence that you were received by the Maharajah this morning.”\r\n\r\n“It is true. I had to talk to him about some business; I am on the point\r\nof purchasing from him a large consignment of indigo for my Hamburg\r\nfirm.”\r\n\r\n“I have, of course, nothing to do with your business; but I must inform\r\nyou that we do not approve of direct communication between Europeans and\r\nthe native princes. You will, therefore, for the future, be best advised\r\nto communicate with me when you are summoned to the Maharajah, so that\r\nwe may arrive at an understanding as to what you may, or may not, say\r\nto him. We cannot, unfortunately, trust all the Indian princes, and this\r\none here is, perhaps, the most unreliable of them all. You must not,\r\nhowever, regard what I say to you as an expression of any want of\r\nconfidence in yourself. The responsibility of my position imposes upon\r\nme, as you see, the greatest possible prudence.”\r\n\r\n“I understand that completely, Colonel!”\r\n\r\n“At this very moment the situation appears to be more than ever\r\ncomplicated. I shall be very much surprised, if we are not on the eve\r\nof very disquieting times. The Governor-General of Turkestan is marching\r\nthis way, and his advance guard has already passed the Afghan frontier.”\r\n\r\nHeideck had difficulty in concealing the excitement, which this\r\nconfirmation of Tchajawadse’s story aroused in him.\r\n\r\n“Is that certain, Colonel? What do the Russians want in Afghanistan?”\r\n\r\n“What do the Russians want there? Now, my dear Mr. Heideck, I think\r\nthat is plain enough. Their advance means war with us. Russia will, of\r\ncourse, not openly allow this at present. They treat their advance as\r\na matter which only concerns the Emir and with which we have nothing to\r\ndo. But one must be very simple not to discern their real intentions.”\r\n\r\n“And may I ask, Colonel, what you are thinking of doing?”\r\n\r\nColonel Baird must really have held the young German for a very\r\ntrustworthy or, at least, for a very harmless personage, for he replied\r\nto his question at once--\r\n\r\n“The Russian advance guard has crossed the Amu Darya and is marching up\r\nthe Murghab Valley upon Herat. We shall take our measures accordingly.\r\nThe Muscovites will have been deceived in us. We are not, after all, so\r\npatient and long-suffering as to let our dear neighbours slip in by the\r\nopen door. I think the Russian generals will pull long faces when they\r\nsuddenly find themselves confronted in Afghanistan by our battalions, by\r\nour Sikhs and Gourkas.”\r\n\r\nThe adjutant made his appearance with what was evidently an important\r\nmessage, and as Heideck perceived that the Colonel wished to speak\r\nprivately to his orderly officer, he considered that politeness required\r\nhim to retire.\r\n\r\nThe words of the Colonel, “The Russian advance into Afghanistan means\r\nwar,” rung unceasingly in his ears. He thanked his good fortune for\r\nhaving brought him at the right moment to the theatre of the great\r\nevents in the world’s history, and all his thoughts were now solely\r\ndirected as to the “where and how” of his being able, on the outbreak of\r\nhostilities, to be present both as spectator and observer.\r\n\r\nThat his Russian friend was animated by the same desire he could all the\r\neasier surmise, owing to the fact that Prince Tchajawadse belonged,\r\nof course, to one of the nations immediately concerned. He hastened,\r\ntherefore, to acquaint him with the results of his interview with\r\nColonel Baird. The effect of his communications upon the Prince was\r\nquite as he had anticipated.\r\n\r\n“So, really! The advance guard is already across the Amu Darya. War\r\nwill, then, break out just in the proper quarter,” exclaimed the Russian\r\nin a loud outburst of joy. “In our army the fear prevailed that the Tsar\r\nwould never brace himself up to the decision to make war. Powerful and\r\nirresistible influences must have been at work to have finally conquered\r\nhis love of peace.”\r\n\r\n“You will, of course, get to the army as soon as possible?” inquired\r\nHeideck; and as the Prince answered in the affirmative, he continued:\r\n“I should be grateful to you if you would allow me to join you. But how\r\nshall we get across the frontier? It is to be hoped that we shall be\r\nallowed to pass quietly as unsuspected merchants.”\r\n\r\n“That is not quite so certain; we shall probably not be able to leave\r\nIndia quite as readily as we entered it; but, at any rate, we must try\r\nour best. We can reach Peshawar by rail in twelve hours and Quetta in\r\nfifteen. Both these lines of railway are not likely at present to\r\nbe blocked by military trains, but we shall do well to hasten our\r\ndeparture. In all probability we shall, either by way of Peshawar\r\nor Quetta, soon meet with Russian troops, for I have no doubt that\r\na Russian army corps is also on the march upon Cabul, although the\r\nColonel, as you say, only spoke of an advance guard moving on Herat.”\r\n\r\n“I would suggest that we go by way of Peshawar and the Khyber Pass,\r\nbecause we should thus reach Cabul most speedily and with the greater\r\nsecurity.”\r\n\r\n“We will talk more of this anon, comrade! At all events, it is settled\r\nthat we travel together. I hope most fervently that in the great theatre\r\nof the world your nation is at this present moment standing shoulder to\r\nshoulder with mine against England.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTAIN’S WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a married man, Captain Irwin was not quartered in one of the wooden\r\nbarracks of the English camp, but had his own bungalow in the suburbs.\r\n\r\nIt was a house of one story with a broad verandah, was surrounded by\r\na large well-kept garden, and formerly served a high official of the\r\nMaharajah as a residence. Apart from it lay two smaller buildings used\r\nas servants’ quarters, of which, however, only one was at present in\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe sun of that same day, that had brought Hermann Heideck face to face\r\nwith such momentous matters affecting his future for his final decision,\r\nwas sinking rapidly into the heavens as he passed through the cactus\r\nhedge and bamboo thicket of the garden surrounding Irwin’s bungalow.\r\n\r\nHe was attired in an evening dress of the lightest black cloth, such as\r\nis prescribed by English custom for a visit paid at the dinner-hour in\r\nthose climes.\r\n\r\nHe did not come that evening of his own initiative, for Irwin’s morning\r\nsalutation did not promise anything in the way of an invitation. A\r\nletter from Mrs. Irwin had, to his surprise, begged his company at\r\nthis hour. He had gathered from the tone of the letter that something\r\nespecially urgent required his presence, and he was not slow in\r\nsupposing that the reason was the unfortunate party at poker in which\r\nthe Captain had taken part.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, could have induced Mrs. Irwin to appeal to him was still\r\nan enigma, for his relations to the beautiful young wife had until then\r\nnot been of a confidential nature. He had met her on several occasions\r\nin big society functions, at the officers’ polo-parties, and at similar\r\ngatherings, and if, attracted by her grace and intellect, he had perhaps\r\npaid more attention to the Captain’s wife than to any of the other\r\nladies of the party, their relations had been strictly confined within\r\nconventional limits, and it would never have occurred to him to imagine\r\nhimself specially favoured by Mrs. Irwin.\r\n\r\nThe dainty Indian handmaid of the lady received him and conducted him to\r\nthe verandah. Mrs. Irwin, who, dressed in red silk, had been seated in\r\na rocking-chair, advanced a few steps to meet him. Once more Irwin felt\r\nhimself enchanted by the charm of her appearance.\r\n\r\nShe was a genuine English beauty of tall and splendid proportions,\r\nfinely chiselled features, and that white transparent skin which lends\r\nto Albion’s daughters their distinctive charm. Abundant dark brown hair\r\nclustered in thick, natural folds round the broad forehead, and her blue\r\neyes had the clear, calm gaze of a personality at once intelligent and\r\nstrong-minded.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the young wife, whom Heideck had hitherto only known as\r\nthe placid and unemotional lady of the world, certainly seemed to labour\r\nunder some excitement, which she could not completely conceal. There\r\nwas something of embarrassment in the manner with which she received her\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\n“I am exceedingly obliged to you for coming, Mr. Heideck. My invitation\r\nwill have surprised you, but I did not know what else to do. Please let\r\nus go into the drawing-room; it is getting very chilly outside.”\r\n\r\nHeideck did not notice anything of the chilliness of which she\r\ncomplained, but he thought he understood that it was only the fear of\r\neavesdropping that prompted the wish of the young wife. As a matter\r\nof fact, she closed the glass door behind him, and motioned him to be\r\nseated in one of the large cane chairs before her.\r\n\r\n“Captain Irwin is not at home,” she began, evidently struggling with\r\nsevere embarrassment. “He has ridden off to inspect his squadron, and\r\nwill not be home, as he told me, before daybreak.”\r\n\r\nHeideck did not quite understand why she told him this. Had he been a\r\nflirt, convinced of his own irresistibility, he would perhaps have\r\nfound in her words a very transparent encouragement; but he was far from\r\ndiscerning any such meaning in Edith’s words. The respect in which he\r\nhad held this beautiful young wife, since the first moment of their\r\nacquaintance, sufficiently protected her from any such dishonourable\r\nsuspicions. That she had bidden him there at a time when she must know\r\nthat their conversation would not be disturbed by the presence of her\r\nhusband, must assuredly have had other reasons than the mere desire for\r\nan adventure.\r\n\r\nAnd as he saw her sitting before him, with a look of deep distress on\r\nher face, there arose in his heart no other than the honest wish to\r\nbe able to do this poor creature, who was evidently most unhappy, some\r\nchivalrous service.\r\n\r\nBut he had not the courage to suggest anything of the sort before she\r\nhad given him in an unequivocal way a right to do so. Hence it was that\r\nhe waited in silence for anything further that she might wish to say.\r\nAnd there was a fairly long and somewhat painful pause before Mrs.\r\nIrwin, evidently collecting all her courage, went on: “You witnessed\r\nthe scene that took place last evening in the officers’ mess between my\r\nhusband and Captain McGregor? If I have been rightly informed, I owe it\r\nsolely to you that my husband did not, in the excitement of the moment,\r\nlay hand on himself.”\r\n\r\nHeideck turned modestly away.\r\n\r\n“I did absolutely nothing to give me any claim to your gratitude, Mrs.\r\nIrwin, and I do not really believe that your husband would have so far\r\nforgot himself as to commit such a silly and desperate deed. At the last\r\nmoment, a thought of you would certainly have restrained him from taking\r\nsuch a step.”\r\n\r\nHe was surprised at the expression of disdain which the face of the\r\nyoung wife assumed as he said this, and at the hard ring in her voice,\r\nwhen she replied--\r\n\r\n“Thoughts of me? No! how little you know my husband. He is not wont\r\nto make the smallest sacrifice for me, and, maybe, his voluntary death\r\nwould not, after all, be the worst misery he is capable of inflicting on\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nShe saw the look of utter surprise in his eyes, and therefore quickly\r\nadded--\r\n\r\n“You will, I know, consider me the most heartless woman in the world\r\nbecause I can talk to a stranger like this; but is not in your country\r\nloss of honour regarded as worse than death?”\r\n\r\n“Under certain circumstances--yes; but your husband’s position is not,\r\nI hope, to be viewed in this tragic light. Judging from the impression\r\nthat Captain McGregor’s personality has made upon me, I should say\r\nthat he is not the man to drive Mr. Irwin to take an extreme course on\r\naccount of a recklessly incurred debt at cards.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no! you judge of that honourable man quite correctly. He would\r\nbe best pleased to forego the whole amount, and with the intention of\r\nbringing about such an arrangement he called here this afternoon. But\r\nthe foolish pride and unbounded vanity of Irwin brought all his good\r\nintentions to naught. The result of McGregor’s well-meant endeavours\r\nwas only a violent scene, which made matters a thousand times worse. My\r\nhusband is determined to pay his debt at any price.”\r\n\r\n“And--pardon me the indiscreet question--is he capable of doing so?”\r\n\r\n“If he uses my fortune for the purpose--certainly! and I have at once\r\nplaced it at his disposal; and I further told him that he could take\r\neverything, even the last penny, if this sacrifice on my part would\r\nsuffice to get rid of him for ever.”\r\n\r\nHeideck could scarcely believe his ears. He was prepared for anything on\r\nearth except to hear such confessions. He began to doubt this woman, who\r\nhitherto had seemed to him to be the paragon of all feminine virtues,\r\nand he sought an opportunity of escaping from further confessions of the\r\nkind, which, as he told himself, she would repent of in the course of an\r\nhour or so.\r\n\r\n“Nobody can expect of you, Mrs. Irwin, that for a criminal recklessness,\r\na hasty action on the part of your husband, who was probably deep in his\r\ncups, you should make such a tremendous sacrifice; but, as you have now\r\ndone me the honour to consult me on these matters, it is perhaps not\r\nunbecoming on my part if I tell you that your husband should, in my\r\nopinion, be forced to bear the consequences of his action. You need not\r\nbe at all apprehensive that these consequences will be very serious.\r\nMcGregor will certainly not press him; and as we seem to be on the\r\nthreshold of a war, his superior officers are not likely to be too\r\nsevere upon him in this matter. He will, perhaps, either find an\r\nopportunity to rehabilitate his compromised honour or will find his\r\ndeath on the battlefield. Within a few weeks, or months, all these\r\nmatters which at present cause you so much trouble will present quite a\r\ndifferent aspect.”\r\n\r\n“You are very kind, Mr. Heideck, and I thank you for your friendly\r\nintentions; but I would not have invited you here at this unusual hour\r\nhad it been solely my intention to enlist your kind sympathy. I am in a\r\nmost deplorable plight--doubly so, because there is no one here to whom\r\nI can turn for advice and assistance. That in my despair I thought of\r\nyou has, no doubt, greatly surprised you; and now I can myself hardly\r\nunderstand how I could have presumed to trouble you with my worries.”\r\n\r\n“If you would only, Mrs. Irwin, show me how I can be of service to you,\r\nI would pray you to make any use you will of me. I am absolutely and\r\nentirely at your disposal, and your confidence would make me exceedingly\r\nhappy.”\r\n\r\n“As a gentleman, you could not, of course, give any other answer. But,\r\nin your heart of hearts, you probably consider my conduct both unwomanly\r\nand unbecoming, for it is true that we hardly know each other. Over in\r\nEngland, and certainly in your German fatherland quite as well, such\r\ncasual meetings as ours have been could not possibly give me the right\r\nto treat you as a friend, and I do not really know how far you are\r\ninfluenced by these European considerations.”\r\n\r\n“In Germany, as in England, every defenceless and unhappy woman would\r\nhave an immediate claim upon my assistance,” he seriously replied. “If\r\nyou give me the preference over your friends here, I, on my part, have\r\nonly to be grateful, and need not inquire further into your motives.”\r\n\r\n“But, of course, I will tell you what my motives are. My friends in this\r\nplace are naturally my husband’s comrades, and I cannot turn to them if\r\nI do not intend to sign Irwin’s death warrant. Not a single man amongst\r\nthem would allow that a man of my husband’s stamp should remain an hour\r\nlonger a member of the corps of officers in the British Army.”\r\n\r\n“I do not quite understand you, Mrs. Irwin. The gambling debt of your\r\nhusband is, after all, no longer a secret to his comrades.”\r\n\r\n“That is not the point. How do you judge of a man who would sell his\r\nwife to pay his gambling debts?”\r\n\r\nThis last sentence struck Heideck like a blow. With dilated eyes he\r\nstared at the young wife who had launched such a terrible indictment\r\nagainst her husband. Never had she looked to him so charming as in this\r\nmoment, when a sensation of womanly shame had suffused her pale cheeks\r\nwith a crimson blush. Never had he felt with such clearness what a\r\nprecious treasure this charming creature would be to a man to whom she\r\ngave herself in love for his very own; and the less he doubted that\r\nshe had just spoken the simple truth, the more did his heart rise in\r\npassionate wrath at the miserable reptile who was abandoned enough to\r\ndrag this precious pearl in the mire.\r\n\r\n“I do not presume to connect your question with Captain Irwin,” said\r\nHeideck, in a perceptibly tremulous voice, “for if he were really\r\ncapable of doing so--”\r\n\r\nEdith interrupted him, pointing to a small case that lay on the little\r\ntable beside her.\r\n\r\n“Would you kindly just look at this ring, Mr. Heideck?”\r\n\r\nHe did as he was asked, and thought he recognised the beautiful diamond\r\nring that he had yesterday seen sparkling on Irwin’s finger. He asked\r\nwhether it was so, and the young wife nodded assent.\r\n\r\n“I gave it to my husband on our wedding-day. The ring is an heirloom in\r\nmy family. Jewellers value it at more than a thousand pounds.”\r\n\r\n“And why, may I ask, does your husband no longer wear it?”\r\n\r\n“Because he intends to sell it. Of course, the Maharajah is the only\r\nperson who can afford the luxury of such articles, and my husband wishes\r\nme to conclude the bargain with the Prince.”\r\n\r\n“You, Mrs. Irwin? And why, pray, does he not do it himself?”\r\n\r\n“Because the Maharajah will not pay him the price he demands. My husband\r\nwill not let the ring go under two lakhs.”\r\n\r\n“But that is a tremendous sum! That would be paying for it twelve times\r\nover!”\r\n\r\n“My husband is, all the same, certain that the bargain would come off\r\nquite easily, provided I personally negotiated it.”\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to misunderstand the meaning of these words, and so\r\ngreat was the indignation they awoke in Heideck, that he sprang up in a\r\nbound from his chair.\r\n\r\n“No! that is impossible--it cannot be! He cannot possibly have suggested\r\nthat! You must have misunderstood him. No man, no officer, no gentleman,\r\ncould ever be guilty of such a low, mean action!”\r\n\r\n“You would be less surprised if you had had the opportunity to know\r\nhim, as I have had, during the short time of our wedded life. There is\r\npractically no act or deed of his that would surprise me now. He has\r\nlong since ceased to love me; and a wife, whose person has become\r\nindifferent to him, has, in his eyes, only a marketable value. It may be\r\nthat some excuse can even be found for his way of regarding things. It\r\nis, possibly, an atavistic relapse into the views of his ancestors, who,\r\nwhen they were sick of their wives, led them with a halter round their\r\nnecks into the marketplace and sold them to the highest bidder. They say\r\nit is not so long ago that this pretty custom has gone out of vogue.”\r\n\r\n“No more, Mrs. Irwin,” Heideck broke in; “I cannot bear to hear you\r\nspeak like that. I must say that I still consider the Captain to have\r\nbeen out of his mind when he dared to expect such a thing of you.”\r\n\r\nThe young wife shook her head with a severe quiver of the lips. “Oh no!\r\nhe was neither intoxicated nor especially excited when he asked me to do\r\nhim this ‘LITTLE’ kindness; he probably considered that I ought to\r\nfeel myself intensely flattered that His Indian Highness thought my\r\ninsignificant person worth such a large price. I have certainly for some\r\ntime past been quite conscious of the fact that, quite unwittingly, I\r\nhave attracted the notice of the Maharajah. Immediately after our first\r\nmeeting he began to annoy me with his attentions. I never took any\r\nnotice, and never, for one moment, dreamt of the possibility that\r\nhis--his--what shall I call it--his admiration could rise to criminal\r\ndesires; but, after what I have experienced to-day, I cannot help\r\nbelieving that it is the case.”\r\n\r\n“But this monstrosity, Mrs. Irwin, will be past and gone as soon as you\r\nindignantly repudiate the suggestion of your abandoned husband?”\r\n\r\n“Between him and me--yes, that is true. But I am not at all certain if\r\nthe Maharajah’s infatuation will then have really ceased to exist. My\r\nIndian handmaid has been told by one of her countrymen to warn me of a\r\ndanger that threatens me. The man did not tell her wherein this danger\r\nconsists, but I am at a loss to know from what quarter it should\r\nthreaten, if not from the Maharajah.”\r\n\r\nHeideck shook his head incredulously.\r\n\r\n“You have certainly nothing to fear in that quarter; he knows full well\r\nthat he would have the whole of the British power against him dared\r\nhe only--be it with one word--attempt to wrong the wife of an English\r\nofficer. He would be a sheer madman to allow things to come to that\r\npass.”\r\n\r\n“Well, after all, he may have some despotic insanity in him. We must\r\nnot forget that the time is not so far distant when all these tyrants\r\ndisposed absolutely of the life and death and body and soul of their\r\nsubjects. Who knows, too, what my husband--But perhaps you are right.\r\nIt may only be a foolish suspicion that has upset me; and it is just for\r\nthis reason that I did not wish to speak about it to any of my husband’s\r\nmessmates. I have opened my heart to you alone. I know that you are an\r\nhonourable man, and that nobody will learn from your mouth what we have\r\nspoken about during this past hour.”\r\n\r\n“I am very much indebted to you, Mrs. Irwin, for your confidence, and\r\nshould be only too willing to do what I could to relieve your anxiety\r\nand trouble. You are apprehensive of some unknown danger, and you are\r\nthis night, in your husband’s absence, without any other protection but\r\nthat of your Indian servants. Would you permit me to remain close by,\r\nuntil tomorrow daybreak?”\r\n\r\nWith a blush that made her heart beat faster, Edith Irwin shook her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“No! no! that is impossible; and I do not think that here, in the\r\nprotection of my house and among my own servants, any mishap could\r\nbefall me. Only in case that something should happen to me at another\r\ntime and at another place, I would beg of you to acquaint Colonel Baird\r\nwith the subject of our conversation this evening; people will then\r\nperhaps better understand the connexion of things.”\r\n\r\nAnd now Heideck perfectly understood why she had chosen to make him, a\r\nstranger, her confidant; and he thought that he understood also that it\r\nwas not so much of an attempt on the part of the Maharajah as of her\r\nown husband’s villainy that the unhappy young wife was afraid. But his\r\ndelicate feelings restrained him from saying in outspoken language that\r\nhe had comprehended what she wished to convey. It was after all enough\r\nthat she knew she could rely upon him; and of this she must have been\r\nalready sufficiently convinced, although it was only the fire of his\r\neyes that told her so, and the long, warm kiss that his lips impressed\r\nupon the small, icy-cold hand which the poor young lady presented to him\r\nat parting.\r\n\r\n“You will permit me to pay you another call tomorrow, will you not?”\r\n\r\n“I will send you word when I expect you. I should not care for you to\r\nmeet my husband; perhaps he has some idea that you are friendly inclined\r\ntowards me; and that would be sufficient to fill him with suspicion and\r\naversion towards you.”\r\n\r\nShe clapped her hands, and as the Indian handmaid entered the room to\r\nescort the visitor to the door, Heideck had to leave her last remark\r\nunanswered. But, as on the threshold he again turned to bow his\r\nfarewell, his eyes met hers, and though their lips were dumb, they had\r\nperhaps told one another more in this single second than during the\r\nwhole time of their long tete-a-tete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE OUTRAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Heideck stepped into the garden he was scarcely able to find his\r\nway, but having taken a few steps his eyes had become accustomed to the\r\ngloom, and the pale light of the stars showed him his path.\r\n\r\nThe garden was surrounded by an impenetrable hedge of cactus plants,\r\nlow enough to allow a tall man to look over. On having closed the\r\nwooden gate behind him, Heideck stood and gazed back at the brightly\r\nilluminated windows of the house. In the presence of the charming woman\r\nhe had manfully suppressed his feelings. No rash word, betraying the\r\ntempest that this nocturnal conversation had left surging in his bosom,\r\nhad escaped his lips. He had not for a moment forgotten that she was the\r\nwife of another, and it would be an infamy to covet her for his wife\r\nso long as she was tied to that other. But he could not disguise from\r\nhimself the fact that he yearned towards her with a passionate love. He\r\nwas to-day, for the first time, conscious that he loved this woman\r\nwith a passion that he had never before felt for another; but there\r\nwas nothing intoxicating or pleasurable in this self-confession. It was\r\nrather a feeling of apprehension of coming difficulties and struggles\r\nthat would beset him in his passion for this charming creature. Had she\r\nnot needed his protection, and had he not promised to remain on the spot\r\nto assist her, he would have escaped in rapid flight from this struggle\r\nwithin him. Yet, under the existing circumstances, there could be no\r\nquestion of his doing this. He had only himself to blame for having\r\ngiven her the right to count upon his friendship; and it was a behest\r\nof chivalry to deserve her confidence. Incapable of tearing himself\r\nfrom the place, where he knew his loved one remained, Heideck must have\r\nstayed a quarter of an hour rooted to the spot, and just when he had\r\nresolved--on becoming conscious of the folly of his behaviour--on\r\nturning homewards, he perceived something unusual enough to cause him to\r\nstay his steps.\r\n\r\nHe saw the house-door, which the Indian maid had a short time before\r\nclosed behind him, open, and in the flood of light which streamed out\r\ninto the darkness, perceived that several men dressed in white garments\r\nhurried, closely following each other, up the steps.\r\n\r\nRemembering Mrs. Irwin’s enigmatical references to a danger which\r\npossibly threatened her, and seized by a horrible dread of something\r\nabout to happen, he pushed open the garden gate and rushed towards the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nHe had not yet reached it, when the shrill cry of a woman in distress\r\nfell upon his ear. Heideck drew the revolver he always carried from his\r\npocket and sprang up the steps at a bound. The door of the drawing-room,\r\nwhere he had shortly before been in conversation with the Captain’s\r\nwife, was wide open, and from it rang the cries for help, whose\r\ndesperate tones brought home to the Captain the certainty that Edith\r\nIrwin was in the gravest peril. Only a few steps, and he saw the young\r\nEnglish lady defending herself heroically against three white-dressed\r\nnatives, who were evidently about to carry her off. Her light silk dress\r\nwas torn to shreds in this unequal struggle, and so great was Heideck’s\r\nindignation at the monstrous brutality of the assailants that he did\r\nnot for a moment hesitate to turn his weapon upon the tall, wild-looking\r\nfellow, whose brown hands were roughly clutching the bare arms of the\r\nyoung lady.\r\n\r\nHe fired, and with a short, dull cry of pain the fellow reeled to the\r\nground. The other two, horror-stricken, let go their victim. One of them\r\ndrew his sabre from the sheath and rushed upon the German. Heideck could\r\nnot fire a second time, being afraid of harming Edith, and so he threw\r\nthe revolver down, and with a rapid motion, for which his adversary\r\nwas fully unprepared, caught the arm of the Indian which was raised to\r\nstrike. Being much more than his match in physical strength, he wrested\r\nthe sabre with a quick jerk from his grasp. The man, now defenceless,\r\ngave up the struggle and like his companion, who had already in silent,\r\ncat-like bounds made his escape, hurried off as fast as his legs would\r\ncarry him.\r\n\r\nHeideck did not pursue him. His only thoughts were for Edith, and his\r\nfears were that she had perhaps received some hurt at the hands of these\r\nbandits. In the same moment that the violent hands of the Indians had\r\nlet her loose, she had fallen down on the carpet, and her marble-pale\r\nface looked to Heideck as that of a dead person. Whilst, curiously\r\nenough, neither Edith’s screams for help nor the crack of the shot had\r\nhad the effect of summoning any one of her servants to her aid, now,\r\nwhen the danger was over, all of a sudden a few scared brown faces\r\npeered in through the open door; and the peremptory order that Heideck\r\naddressed in English to the terrified maid brought her back to her sense\r\nof duty to her mistress.\r\n\r\nWith her assistance, Heideck carried the fainting woman to a couch, and\r\nperceiving one of the little green flasks of lavender water, which are\r\nnever wanting in an English house, on the table, he employed the strong\r\nperfume as well as he was able, whilst the Indian maid rubbed the soles\r\nof her young mistress’ feet, and adopted divers other methods, well\r\nknown among the natives, of resuscitating her.\r\n\r\nUnder their joint attentions, Edith soon opened her eyes, and gazed with\r\nbewildered looks around her. But on seeing lying on the floor the corpse\r\nof the Indian whom Heideck had shot, her consciousness returned with\r\nperfect clearness.\r\n\r\nShaking off the last traces of faintness with a firm will, she got up.\r\n\r\n“It was you who saved me, Mr. Heideck! You risked your life for me! How\r\ncan I thank you enough?”\r\n\r\n“Solely, madam, by allowing me to conduct you at once to the Colonel’s\r\nhouse, whose protection you must necessarily claim until your\r\nhusband’s return. Whoever may have been the instigator of this hellish\r\nplot--whether these rogues were common thieves or whether they acted on\r\norders, I do not feel myself strong enough, single-handed, to accept the\r\nresponsibility for your security.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” Edith replied gently. “I will get ready at once and go\r\nwith you--but this man here,” she added, shivering, “is he dead, or can\r\nsomething be done for him?”\r\n\r\nHeideck stooped down and regarded the motionless figure. A single look\r\ninto the sallow, drawn face, with the dilated, glassy eyes, sufficed to\r\nassure him that any further examination was useless.\r\n\r\n“He has got his reward,” he said, “and he has no further claim upon your\r\ngenerous compassion; but is there no one to help me get the body away?”\r\n\r\n“They are all out,” said the maid; “the butler invited them to spend a\r\njolly evening with him in the town.”\r\n\r\nEdith and Heideck exchanged a significant look; neither of them now\r\ndoubted in the least that the audacious attack had been the result of\r\na plot to which the Indian servants were parties, and each guessed that\r\nthe other entertained the same suspicion as to who was the instigator of\r\nthe shameful outrage.\r\n\r\nBut they did not utter a syllable about it. It was just because they had\r\nbeen brought as near to each other by the events of this night as fate\r\ncan possibly bring two young beings of different sex, that each felt\r\nalmost instinctively the fear of that first word which probably would\r\nhave broken down the last barrier between them. And Captain Irwin’s name\r\nwas not mentioned by either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE MAHARAJAH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was noon the next day when Captain Irwin stepped out of the Colonel’s\r\nbungalow and turned towards home. The interview with his superior\r\nofficer appeared to have been serious and far from pleasant for him, for\r\nhe was very pale. Red spots were burning on his cheeks, and his deep-set\r\neyes flashed darkly, as though with suppressed wrath. A few minutes\r\nlater the Colonel’s horse was led to the door, and a company of lancers\r\nunder the command of a sergeant rode into the courtyard.\r\n\r\nThe commander came out in full uniform, and, placing himself at the head\r\nof the company, galloped towards the Maharajah’s palace.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry drew up before the palace gates, and Colonel Baird shouted\r\nout in a loud commanding voice to the servants lounging at the door that\r\nhe wished to speak to the Maharajah.\r\n\r\nA few minutes passed, and a gorgeously attired palace official made\r\nhis appearance with the answer that His Highness could not receive at\r\npresent; the Colonel would be informed as soon as the audience could be\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nThe commander leapt from the saddle, and with jingling spurs walked\r\nfirmly into the palace, trailing his sword noisily over the marble\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n“Tell the Prince I desire to see him at once,” he called out in a\r\nthreatening voice to the palace officials and servants who followed him\r\nin evident embarrassment. It was evident that no one dare disobey such\r\na peremptory command. All gates flew open before the Englishman, and he\r\nhad hardly to wait a minute in the anteroom before the Prince consented\r\nto receive him. On a small high-raised terrace of the ground floor the\r\nMaharajah sat at luncheon. He purposely did not change his easy attitude\r\nwhen the English resident approached, and the glaring look which his\r\ndark eyes cast at the incomer was obviously intended to intimidate.\r\n\r\nWith his helmet on his head and his hand resting on his sword the\r\nColonel stood straight before the Prince.\r\n\r\n“I desire to have a few words with you, Maharajah!”\r\n\r\n“And I have instructed my servants to inform you that I am not at your\r\nservice. You see I am at luncheon!”\r\n\r\n“That, in your case, is no reason for refusing to receive the\r\nrepresentative of His Britannic Majesty. The message you sent me was an\r\ninsult, which, if repeated, will have to be punished.”\r\n\r\nIn a transport of rage the Prince sprang up from his chair. He hurled an\r\nabusive epithet into the Colonel’s face, and his right hand sought the\r\ndagger in his belt. The attendant, who was about to serve up to his\r\nmaster a ruddy lobster on a silver dish, recoiled in alarm. But the\r\nColonel, without moving an inch from his place, placed the silver\r\nhunting whistle that hung from his shoulder to his mouth. Two shrill\r\ncalls, and at once the trotting of horses and the rattle of arms was\r\naudible. The high, blue-striped turbans of the cavalry and the pennons\r\nof their lances made their appearance under the terrace.\r\n\r\n“Call my bodyguard!” cried the Prince, with a voice hoarse with rage.\r\n\r\nBut in a voice of icy calm the Colonel retorted, “If you summon your\r\nbodyguard, Maharajah, you are a dead man. That would be rebellion; and\r\nwith rebels we make short shrift.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince pressed his lips together; the rage he had with the greatest\r\ndifficulty suppressed caused his body to quiver as in a paroxysm of\r\nfever, but he had to realise that he was here the weaker, and without a\r\nword more he fell back again into his chair.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel stepped to the balcony of the terrace.\r\n\r\n“Sergeant Thomson!” he called down into the park.\r\n\r\nHeavy steps were heard on the marble stairs, and the man summoned,\r\nfollowed by two soldiers, stood at attention before his superior\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n“Sergeant, do you know the gentleman sitting at that table?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir! It is His Highness the Maharajah.”\r\n\r\n“If I gave you orders to arrest this gentleman and bring him to camp,\r\nwould you hesitate to obey?”\r\n\r\nThe sergeant regarded his superior officer as if the doubt of his loyal\r\nmilitary obedience astonished him. He at once gave the two soldiers who\r\nwere with him a nod and advanced a step further towards the Prince, as\r\nthough at once to carry out the order.\r\n\r\n“Stop, sergeant!” cried the Colonel. “I hope that His Highness will not\r\nlet matters go as far as that. You are perhaps ready now, Maharajah, to\r\nreceive me?”\r\n\r\nThe Indian silently pointed to the golden chair at the other end of\r\nthe table. At a sign from the Colonel the sergeant and the two soldiers\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\n“I have a very serious question to put to you, Maharajah.”\r\n\r\n“Speak!”\r\n\r\n“Last evening, during Captain Irwin’s absence, several rascals entered\r\nhis house with the intention of committing an act of violence on\r\nthe person of the Captain’s wife. What do you know about the matter,\r\nMaharajah?”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand, Colonel. What should I know?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you would be well advised to try and remember. Do you mean to\r\ntell me that you now hear of this business for the first time?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly! I have not heard a word about it until now.”\r\n\r\n“And you have not been told that one of the assailants who was killed on\r\nthe spot was one of your servants?”\r\n\r\n“No. I have a great many servants, and I am not responsible for their\r\nactions, if they are not done by my orders.”\r\n\r\n“But this is exactly what I believe to have been the case. You will\r\nhardly expect me to believe that one of your servants would have dared\r\nto make such an attack on his own initiative. Unfortunately, the other\r\nvillains have escaped, but one of them left behind him a sabre belonging\r\nto a man in your bodyguard.”\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the Maharajah had a hard struggle to keep his\r\ncomposure. Endeavouring to conceal his rage behind a supercilious smile,\r\nhe answered--\r\n\r\n“It is beneath my dignity, Colonel, to answer you.”\r\n\r\n“There can be no question of dignity justifying you in a refusal to\r\nanswer the British resident, when he demands it. You are dealing not\r\nwith an ordinary British officer, but with the representative of His\r\nMajesty the Emperor of India. It is your duty to answer, as it is mine\r\nto question you. A refusal might have the most serious consequences for\r\nYour Highness; for the Government Commissioners that would be despatched\r\nfrom Calcutta to Chanidigot on my report might be but little impressed\r\nby your dignity.”\r\n\r\nThe Indian set his teeth and a wild passionate hate flashed from his\r\neyes, but, at the same time, he probably reflected that he would not\r\nhave been the first of the Indian princes to be deprived of the last\r\nremnant of sham sovereignty for a paltry indiscretion.\r\n\r\n“If you consider it necessary to make a report to Calcutta, I cannot\r\nprevent your doing so; but I should think that the Viceroy would\r\nhesitate before giving offence to a faithful ally of England, and at\r\nthe very moment when he has to ask him to despatch his contingent of\r\nauxiliary forces.”\r\n\r\n“Since you refer to this matter--whom have you appointed to command your\r\nforce?”\r\n\r\n“My cousin, Tasatat Maharajah.”\r\n\r\n“And when will he start?”\r\n\r\n“In about four weeks, I hope.”\r\n\r\nThe officer shook his head.\r\n\r\n“That would be much longer than we can allow. Your force is to join my\r\ndetachment, and I am starting at latest in a fortnight from now.”\r\n\r\n“You are asking what is impossible. At present we have not a sufficient\r\nnumber of horses, and I do not know where to procure two thousand camels\r\nin such a short time; and I have not nearly enough ammunition for the\r\ninfantry.”\r\n\r\n“The requisite ammunition can be provided by the arsenal at Mooltan and\r\ndebited to your account, Highness. As for the horses and camels,\r\nyou will, no doubt, be able to furnish them in time, if you take the\r\ntrouble. I repeat that in a fortnight all must be ready. Do not forget\r\nthat the punctual execution of these orders is in a way an earnest of\r\nyour fidelity and zeal. Every unwarranted delay and all equivocation on\r\nyour part will be fatal to you.”\r\n\r\nThe emphasis with which these words were spoken showed how seriously\r\nthey were meant, and the Maharajah, whose yellow skin had for a moment\r\nbecome darker, silently inclined his head.\r\n\r\nColonel Baird rose from his seat.\r\n\r\n“As to the affair touching Mrs. Irwin, I demand that a thorough\r\ninvestigation shall be immediately set on foot, and require that it\r\nshall be conducted with unsparing rigour, without any underhand tricks\r\nand quibbles. The insult that has been offered by some of your subjects\r\nto an officer of His Majesty and a British lady is so heinous that not\r\nonly the criminals themselves, but also the instigators of the crime,\r\nmust be delivered up to suffer their well-merited punishment. I allow\r\nyou twenty-four hours. If I do not receive a satisfactory report from\r\nyou before the expiry of this time, I shall myself conduct the inquiry.\r\nYou may rest assured that the information required will then be obtained\r\nwithin the shortest space of time.”\r\n\r\nHe made a military bow and descended the steps of the terrace, this\r\ntime taking the shortest way. The cavalry dashed off amid a jingling of\r\nswords and accoutrements. The Maharajah followed their departure with\r\nlowering, flashing eyes. He then ordered his servant to fetch his body\r\nphysician, Mohammed Bhawon. And when, a few minutes later, the lean,\r\nshrivelled little man, with his wrinkled brown face and penetrating\r\nblack eyes, dressed entirely in white muslin, was ushered into his\r\npresence, he beckoned to him graciously, inviting him to be seated by\r\nhim on the gold-embroidered cushion.\r\n\r\nA second imperious wave of the hand dismissed the attendant. Placing his\r\narm confidentially round the neck of the physician, the Maharajah talked\r\nlong and intimately to him in carefully hushed tones--but in a friendly\r\nand coaxing manner, as one talks to someone from whom one demands\r\nsomething out of the way, his eyes flashing the while with passionate\r\nrage and deadly hate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE PAMIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn vain did Heideck, on the day following the night-attack, wait for a\r\nmessage from Edith, giving him an opportunity of seeing her again. He\r\nwas prepared to be taken to task by Irwin on account of his evening\r\nvisit at the villa. But the Captain did not show himself.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning Heideck had been summoned to the Colonel to report\r\non the incident of the preceding night. The conversation had been short,\r\nand Heideck gained the impression that the Colonel observed a studied\r\nreserve in his questions.\r\n\r\nHe evidently desired the German to believe that in his own conviction\r\nthey had only to deal with bold burglars, who had acted on their own\r\nresponsibility. He mentioned quite incidentally that the dead man\r\nhad been recognised as one of the Maharajah’s bodyguard. To Heideck’s\r\ninquiry whether the killing of the man could involve him in difficulties\r\nwith the civil authorities, the Colonel answered with a decisive--\r\n\r\n“No. You acted in justifiable self-defence in shooting the fellow\r\ndown. I give you my word, you will neither be troubled about it by the\r\nauthorities nor by the Maharajah.”\r\n\r\nHis inquiry after Mrs. Irwin’s health was also satisfactorily answered.\r\n\r\n“The lady, I am glad to say, is in the best of health,” said the\r\nColonel. “She has admirable courage.”\r\n\r\nThe next morning again, Captain Irwin neither made his appearance nor\r\nsent any message. Heideck and Prince Tchajawadse were sitting in their\r\nbungalow at breakfast discussing the important intelligence brought by\r\nthe morning papers.\r\n\r\nThe India Times declared that Russia had infringed the treaties of\r\nLondon by her invasion of Afghanistan, and that England was thus\r\njustified, nay compelled, to send an army to Afghanistan. It was\r\nearnestly to be hoped that peaceful negotiations would succeed in\r\naverting the threatened conflict. But should the Russian army not return\r\nto Turkestan, England also would be obliged to have recourse to strong\r\nmeasures. An English force would occupy Afghanistan, and compel the\r\nAmeer, as an ally of the Indian Government, to fulfil his obligations.\r\nTo provide for all contingencies, a strong fleet was being fitted out in\r\nthe harbours of Portsmouth and Plymouth to proceed to the Baltic at the\r\nright moment.\r\n\r\n“Still more significant than this,” said Heideck, “is the fact that the\r\ntwo and a half per cent. Consols were quoted at ninety yesterday on the\r\nLondon Exchange, while a week ago they stood at ninety-six. The English\r\nare reluctant to declare openly that war has already commenced.”\r\n\r\n“War without a declaration of war,” the Prince agreed. “In any case we\r\nmust hurry, if we are to get over the frontier. I should be sorry to\r\nmiss the moment when fighting begins in Afghanistan.”\r\n\r\n“I can feel with you there. But there really is no time to lose.”\r\n\r\n“If you agree, we will start this very day. At midnight we shall arrive\r\nat Mooltan, and at noon to-morrow in Attock. To-morrow night we can be\r\nin Peshawar. There we must get our permits to cross the Khyber Pass.\r\nThe sooner we get through the Pass the better, for later we might have\r\ndifficulties in obtaining permission.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you are carrying nothing suspicious about you--charts, drawings,\r\nor things of that sort.”\r\n\r\nThe Russian smilingly shook his head. “Nothing but Murray’s Guide, the\r\nindispensable companion of all travellers; I should take good care\r\nnot to take anything else. As for you, of course you need not be so\r\ncareful.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because you are a German. There is no war with Germany, but I should at\r\nonce be in danger of being arrested as a spy.”\r\n\r\n“I really believe that neither of us need fear anything, even if we\r\nwere recognised as officers. I should think that there are quite as many\r\nEnglish officers on Russian territory at this very moment as Russian\r\nofficers here in India.”\r\n\r\n“As long as war has not been actually declared, it is customary to be\r\ncivil to the officers of foreign Powers, but, under the circumstances,\r\nI would not rely upon this. The possibility of being drumhead\r\ncourt-martialled and shot might not be remote. Luckily, not even\r\nRoentgen rays could discover what a store of drawings, charts, and\r\nfortress plans I keep in my memory. But you have not answered my\r\nquestion yet, comrade!--are you prepared to start to-day?”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry, but I must ask you not to count upon me; I should prefer to\r\nstay here for the present.”\r\n\r\nOn noting the surprise of the Russian he continued: “You yourself said\r\njust now that I, as a German, am in a less precarious position. Even if\r\nI am recognised as an officer, it is hardly probable that I should\r\nfind myself in serious difficulties. At least, not here, where there is\r\nnothing to spy into.”\r\n\r\nHe did not betray that it was solely the thought of Mrs. Irwin that had\r\nsuddenly made him change his plans. And the Russian evidently did not\r\ntrouble further about his motives.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what my whole anxiety is, at this moment?” he asked. “I am\r\nafraid of Germany seizing the convenient opportunity, and attacking\r\nus in our rear. Your nation does not love ours; let us make no mistake\r\nabout it. There was a time when Teutonism played a great role in our\r\nnational life. But all that has changed since the days of Alexander the\r\nThird. We also cannot forget that at the Berlin Congress Master Bismarck\r\ncheated us of the prize of our victory over the Turks.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, Prince, for contradicting you on this point. The fault\r\nwas solely Gortchakow’s in not understanding how to follow up his\r\nopportunity. The English took advantage of that. No doubt Bismarck would\r\nhave agreed to every Russian demand. But I can assure you that there\r\nis no question of national German enmity against Russia, in educated\r\ncircles especially.”\r\n\r\n“It is possible, but Russia will always consider this aversion as a\r\nfactor to be taken into account at critical moments, otherwise the\r\ntreaty with France would probably never have been made. I, for one, can\r\nhardly blame your nation for entertaining a certain degree of hostility\r\ntowards us. We possess diverse territories geographically belonging more\r\nnaturally to Germany. If your country could take eight million peasants\r\nfrom your superfluous population and settle them in Poland it would be\r\na grand thing for her. Were I at the head of your Government I should,\r\nfirst, with Austria’s consent, seize Russian Poland, and then crush\r\nAustria, annex Bohemia, Moravia, Carinthia, Styria and the Tyrol as\r\nGerman territory, and limit the Austrian dynasty to Transleithania.”\r\n\r\nHeideck could not help smiling.\r\n\r\n“Those are bold fancies, Prince! Rest assured that nobody in Germany\r\nseriously entertains such plans.”\r\n\r\n“Strange, if that is so. I should think it would seem the most natural\r\nthing for you. What, then, do you mean by a German Empire, if the most\r\nGerman countries do not belong to it? Do you not consider the population\r\nof Austria’s German provinces is more closely related to you than that\r\nof North-East Prussia? But possibly you are too conscientious and too\r\ntreaty-abiding to carry out a policy of such dimensions.”\r\n\r\nHeideck, not unintentionally, turned the conversation back to the\r\noriginal subject of discussion.\r\n\r\n“Which route do you intend taking? Have you decided for Peshawar, or are\r\nyou also taking Quetta into your consideration?”\r\n\r\n“I have not as yet quite made up my mind. In any case, I mean to take\r\nthe shortest way back to our army.”\r\n\r\n“If that is so, I would suggest Quetta. Most probably the Russian main\r\narmy will turn southwards. Their first objective will probably be Herat.\r\nThe best roads from the north and north-west converge on that point.\r\nIt is the meeting-place of the caravan roads from India, Persia, and\r\nTurkestan. In Herat a large army can be concentrated, for it is situated\r\nin fertile country. Once your advance guard is firmly established,\r\n60,000 men can be conveyed there in a relatively short time. If the\r\nEnglish advance to Kandahar the collision between the forces will take\r\nplace at that point. But the Russians will outnumber the English so\r\ngreatly that the latter will hardly venture the march upon Kandahar.\r\nReinforced by the Afghan forces, General Ivanov, with 100,000 men, can\r\npush on without hindrance to the Bolan Pass.”\r\n\r\n“If he should succeed,” said the Prince, “the way would then be open for\r\nhim to the valley of the Indus. For England would be unable to hold the\r\nPass against such a force.”\r\n\r\n“Is it really so difficult to cross the Pass, as it is said to be?”\r\n inquired Heideck.\r\n\r\n“The Pass is about fifty versts in length. In 1839 the Bengal corps of\r\nthe Indus army advanced through it against the Afghan army, and managed\r\nwithout difficulty to take with them twenty-four-pound howitzers as well\r\nas eighteen-pound field guns.”\r\n\r\n“If I remember rightly they arrived, without having met with any\r\nopposition worth mentioning, at Kandahar, and occupied the whole of\r\nAfghanistan. But, in spite of this, they finally suffered a disastrous\r\ndefeat. Of their 15,000 men only 4,500 succeeded in returning in\r\nprecipitate flight through the Khyber Pass back to India.”\r\n\r\nPrince Tchajawadse laughed ironically.\r\n\r\n“Fifteen thousand? Yes, if one can trust English sources of information!\r\nBut I can assure you, according to better information, that the English\r\nin 1839 advanced upon Afghanistan with no less than 21,000 combatants\r\nand a transport of 70,000 men and 60,000 camels. They marched through\r\nthe Bolan Pass, took Kandahar and Ghazni, entered Cabul, and placed\r\nShah Shuja upon the throne. They did not suffer any decisive defeat in\r\nbattle, but a general insurrection of the Afghans drove them from their\r\npositions and entirely wiped out their force.”\r\n\r\n“I admire your memory, Prince!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! all this we are obliged to have off by heart in the General Staff\r\nCollege, if we are not to be miserably ploughed in examination. In\r\nNovember, 1878, we were rather weak in Central Asia through having to\r\ndevote all our resources to bringing the war with Turkey to a close, and\r\nso the English again entered Afghanistan. They meant to take advantage\r\nof our embarrassments to bring the country entirely under their\r\nsuzerainty. They advanced in three columns by way of the Bolan Pass, the\r\nKuram Valley, and the Khyber Pass. But on this occasion too they were\r\nunable to stand their ground, and had to retire with great loss. No\r\nPower will ever be able to establish itself in Afghanistan without the\r\nsympathies of the natives on its side. And the sympathies of the Afghans\r\nare on our side. We understand how to manage these people; the English\r\nare solely infidels in their eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Do you believe that Russia merely covets the buffer-state Afghanistan,\r\nor do its intentions go further?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear comrade, at present we mean India. For more than a hundred\r\nyears past we have had our eye on this rich country. The final aim of\r\nall our conquests in Central Asia has been India. As early as 1801 the\r\nEmperor Paul commanded the Hetman of the army of the Don, Orlov, to\r\nmarch upon the Ganges with 22,000 Cossacks. It is true that the campaign\r\nat that time was considered a far simpler matter than it really is. The\r\nEmperor died, and his venturesome plan was not proceeded with. During\r\nthe Crimea General Kauffmann offered to conquer India with 25,000 men.\r\nBut nothing came of this project. Since then ideas have changed. We have\r\nseen that only a gradual advance can lead us to our objective. And we\r\nhave not lost time. In the west we have approached Herat, until now we\r\nare only about sixty miles away, and in the east, in the Pamirs, we have\r\npushed much nearer still to India.”\r\n\r\n“It is most interesting to hear all this. I have done my best to get at\r\nthe lie of the land, but till now the Pamir frontiers have always been a\r\nmystery to me.”\r\n\r\n“They mystify most people, you will find. Only a person who has been\r\nthere can understand the situation. And he who has been there does not\r\nknow the frontier line either, for there is, in fact, no exact boundary.\r\nThe Pamir plateau lies to the north of Peshawar, and is bounded in the\r\nsouth by the Hindu-Kush range. The territorial spheres of government\r\nare extremely complicated. The Ameer of the neighbouring country of\r\nAfghanistan claims the sovereignty over the khanates Shugnan and Roshan,\r\nwhich form the larger portion of the Pamirs. Moreover, he likewise\r\nraises pretensions to the province of Seistan, which is also claimed by\r\nPersia. Now this province is of peculiar importance, because the English\r\ncould seize it from Baluchistan without much difficulty, and, if so,\r\nthey would obtain a strong flank position to the south of our line of\r\nmarch, Merv-Herat, by way of Kandahar-Quetta.”\r\n\r\n“The conditions are, certainly, very complicated.”\r\n\r\n“So complicated, indeed, that for many years past we have had\r\ndifferences with the English touching the frontier question. Our British\r\nfriends have over and over again forced the Ameer of Afghanistan to\r\nsend troops thither; an English expedition for the purpose of frontier\r\ndelimitation has been frequently camped on the Pamir Mountains. Of\r\ncourse, in this respect, we have not been behindhand either. I myself\r\nhave before now taken part in such a scientific expedition.”\r\n\r\n“And it really was merely a scientific expedition?”\r\n\r\n“Let us call it a military scientific excursion!” replied the Prince,\r\nsmiling. “We had 2,000 Cossacks with us, and got as far as the\r\nHindu-Kush--the Baragil Pass and another, unnamed, which we called,\r\nin honour of our colonel, the Yonov Pass. There we were confronted by\r\nAfghan troops, and defeated them at Somatash. By order of the English,\r\nwho were paying him subsidies, Ameer Abdur-Rahman was obliged to resent\r\nthis and petition their assistance. An English envoy arrived in Cabul,\r\nand negotiations were entered into, which we contrived to spin out\r\nsufficiently to gain time for the erection of small forts in the Pamirs.\r\nFinally an arrangement was arrived at in London to the effect that the\r\nPench should be the boundary between Russia and Afghanistan in the Pamir\r\nterritory. A few months later we were met by an English expedition on\r\nthe Sarykul; we were to determine the exact boundary-line together. It\r\nwas great fun; our English comrades tried hard not to let us see that\r\nthey had orders to be complacent. We had soon discovered it, and drew\r\nthe line just as we pleased. The upshot was that only a very narrow\r\nstrip of land between Bukhara and the Indian border remained to the\r\nAmeer, and that he had to undertake neither to station troops there nor\r\nto erect fortifications. Our territory had been pushed forward up to\r\nwithin about twelve miles of English territory. It is there that we are\r\nclosest to India, and we can, if we choose, at any time descend from\r\nthe passes of the Hindu-Kush to the Chitral Valley, within the British\r\nsphere of influence.”\r\n\r\nA servant, bringing an invitation to Heideck from Mrs. Baird to dine\r\nwith them that evening, interrupted the conversation. The Captain\r\nwas scarcely able to disguise his pleasure; he had no doubt that this\r\ninvitation was due to Edith, and was happy in the prospect of seeing her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“You are on good terms with the Colonel,” said the Prince, as soon as\r\nthe servant had left with Heideck’s letter of acceptance. “This can be\r\nof the greatest assistance to you under present circumstances. Do make\r\nhim give you a passport and come with me.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry, Prince! I should be delighted to travel in such pleasant\r\ncompany, but business keeps me here a little longer for the present.”\r\n\r\n“Well--as you please--I must not try to over-persuade you; but I will\r\nnot abandon the hope that we shall meet again, and it is unnecessary to\r\nassure you that you can count upon me in any situation in which you may\r\nfind yourself.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN EMPEROR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German Emperor was paying his annual visit to the moors at Springe.\r\nBut this year he had little time to spare for the noble sport which\r\nusually brought him fresh vigour and recreation in the refreshing\r\nsolitude of the forest. The telegraph was busy without interruption,\r\nand statesmen, diplomats, and high officers arrived daily at the\r\nhunting-box, and held long conferences with the Emperor. The windows\r\nof his study were lit up till late at night, and the early morning\r\ngenerally found the monarch again at his writing-desk.\r\n\r\nAfter a night half spent at work, to-day the yearning for a breath\r\nof fresh air had taken the Emperor at early dawn into the silent\r\npine-woods.\r\n\r\nA light hoar-frost had fallen during the night, covering the ground\r\nwith fine white crystals. The shadows of dawn still lingered between\r\nthe tree-trunks. But in the east a glowing light suffused the pale,\r\ngreyish-blue sky.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor directed his gaze in that direction. He halted under a tall,\r\nancient fir-tree, and his lips moved in silent prayer. He asked for\r\ncounsel and strength from Him who decides the fate of nations, to\r\nenable him to arrive at his weighty and difficult decision at this grave\r\ncrisis. Suddenly, the sound of human voices struck his ear. He perceived\r\ntwo men, evidently unaware of his presence, coming towards him hard\r\nby, on the small huntsman’s track in the wood, engaged in lively\r\nconversation. The Emperor’s keen huntsman’s eye recognised in one of\r\nthe two tall gentlemen his Master of Horse, Count Wedel. The other was a\r\nstranger to him.\r\n\r\nIt was the stranger who now said--\r\n\r\n“It is a great pleasure to me, at last, to be able to talk to you\r\nface to face. I have deeply mourned the rift in our old friendship and\r\nfellowship. On my side, the irritation is long since past. I did not\r\nwish to enter the Prussian service at that time, because I could not\r\nbear the thought of our old, brave Hanoverian army having ceased to\r\nexist, and I was angry with you, my dear Ernest, because you, an old\r\nHanoverian Garde du Corps officer, appeared to have forgotten the honour\r\ndue to your narrower Fatherland. But the generous resolution of the\r\nEmperor to revive Hanoverian traditions, to open a new home to our old\r\ncorps of officers, and to inscribe our glorious emblems upon the flags\r\nand standards of these new regiments, has made everything right. I hope\r\nthe time is not far distant when also those Hanoverians, who still hold\r\naloof in anger, will allow that a war lord of such noble disposition is\r\nthe chosen shepherd and leader of the universal Fatherland.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I have never misjudged you and your iron will. Meanwhile, you\r\nhave thoroughly made acquaintance with the world, and since you are a\r\nmerchant prince of Hamburg, I suppose you are the possessor of a large\r\nfortune.”\r\n\r\n“My life has been both interesting and successful, but I have not got\r\nwhat is best after all. I long for a sphere of activity in keeping with\r\nmy disposition. I am a soldier, as my forbears have been for centuries\r\nbefore me. Had I entered the Prussian army in 1866, I might to-day be\r\nin command, and might perhaps in a short time have the honour to lead my\r\ncorps into the field under the eyes of our Emperor himself.”\r\n\r\n“You believe Germany will be brought into this war? Against whom should\r\nwe fight?”\r\n\r\n“If our Emperor is really the sharp-sighted and energetic spirit for\r\nwhich I take him--”\r\n\r\nThe monarch did not care to let the gentlemen talk on longer in\r\nignorance of his presence.\r\n\r\n“Hallo! gentlemen!” he called out merrily. “Do not betray your secrets\r\nwithout knowing who is listening!”\r\n\r\n“His Majesty!” the Count said under his breath, taking off his hat\r\nand bowing low. His companion followed his example, and as the Emperor\r\nlooked at him with a questioning glance, said--\r\n\r\n“At your Majesty’s command; Grubenhagen, of Hamburg.”\r\n\r\nThe monarch’s eyes travelled over the tall, broad-shouldered figure of\r\nthe fine man, and he asked smilingly--\r\n\r\n“You have been in the service?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your Majesty--as lieutenant in the Royal Hanoverian Garde du\r\nCorps.”\r\n\r\n“There were then commoners as officers in that regiment.”\r\n\r\n“May it please your Majesty, my name is Baron von Grubenhagen, but the\r\n‘Baron’ was in the way of the merchant.”\r\n\r\nThe open and manly bearing of the Baron, combined with the deference due\r\nto his sovereign, appeared to please the Emperor. He gazed long into the\r\nclear-cut, energetic face, with its bold and intelligent eyes.\r\n\r\n“You have seen much of the world?”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty, I was in America, and for many years in England, before\r\nentering business.”\r\n\r\n“A good merchant often sees more than a diplomatist, for his view is\r\nunbiassed, and freer. I love your Hamburg; it is a loyal city, full of\r\nintelligence and enterprise.”\r\n\r\n“The Alster people would reckon themselves happy to hear your Majesty\r\nsay so.”\r\n\r\n“Do not the Hamburgers suffer great losses from the war?”\r\n\r\n“Many people in Hamburg think as I do, your Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“And what is your opinion?”\r\n\r\n“That, under the glorious reign of your Majesty, all Germans on the\r\nContinent will be united to one whole grand nation, to which\r\nall Germanic races of the north will be attracted by the law of\r\ngravitation--Danes, Swedes, and Norwegians.”\r\n\r\n“You have the courage of your opinions.”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty, we live in an age, the characteristic of which is the\r\nformation of great empires.”\r\n\r\nThe monarch interrupted him with a friendly movement of his hand.\r\n\r\n“Let us go in to breakfast, gentlemen. Baron von Grubenhagen, you are my\r\nguest. I shall be interested to hear more of your bold ideas.”\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after his return to the hunting-box, the Imperial\r\nChancellor, who had arrived from Berlin by a night train, had been\r\nannounced to the Emperor. With the monarch’s suite he also was present\r\nat the breakfast-table, probably not a little surprised to find a\r\nstrange guest in the company of the Emperor, who was evidently very\r\nkindly disposed to him.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, when the company were seated around the table in the\r\nsmoke-room, and when, upon a sign from the Emperor, the aide-de-camp du\r\njour had ordered the servants to withdraw, the Emperor William turned\r\nwith a grave face to Baron von Grubenhagen.\r\n\r\n“And now let us hear, openly and without reserve, how, according to your\r\nobservation, the German nation regards the possibility of a war.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron raised his fine, characteristic head. Looking openly and\r\nnaturally into the Emperor’s eyes, he replied--\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty, no one is in doubt that it would, on the one hand, be a\r\nfatal step to declare war. By it many thousands will be sent to an early\r\ngrave, lands devastated, and commerce perhaps ruined for many long years\r\nto come; and countless tears are the inevitable concomitants of war. But\r\nthere is a supreme law, to which all others must yield--the commandment\r\nto preserve honour unsullied. A nation has its honour, like the\r\nindividual. Where this honour is at stake, it must not shrink from war.\r\nFor the conservation of all other of this world’s goods is dependent\r\nupon the conservation of the national honour; where peace has to be\r\npreserved at any price, even at the price of national honour, all the\r\nbenefits and blessings of peace will by degrees be lost, and the nation\r\nfalls a prey to its neighbours. Iron is more precious than gold, for it\r\nis to iron we owe all our possessions. What use would be our army\r\nand navy? They are the outward sign of the political truth, that only\r\ncourage and power are guarantees for the continuance and prosperity of\r\na nation. Russia and France have joined hands to fight England. And the\r\nGerman nation feels it is time to take its share in these struggles. But\r\nnowhere is there any uncertainty as to which side Germany ought to\r\njoin. Our nation has for a long time past been exasperated by English\r\nintrigues and encroachments. The human heart knows no other feeling so\r\nprofound and powerful as the sense of justice, and the sense of justice\r\nhas constantly been wounded by England’s policy. Only one word from the\r\nEmperor is needed to strike the deepest chords in the German soul,\r\nand to raise a flame of enthusiasm that will swallow up all internal\r\ndissension and all party quarrels. We must not ask what might possibly\r\nhappen; we must obey the dictates of the hour. If Germany fights with\r\nthe whole of her strength, she must be victorious. And victory is always\r\nits own justification.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nFIVE LAKHS OF RUPEES\r\n\r\n\r\nAt noon Prince Tchajawadse departed northwards accompanied by his page\r\nGeorgi and his Indian servant. Heideck had observed great reserve during\r\nthe short time he had known the beautiful Circassian, and had never\r\nbetrayed that he had guessed the secret of her disguise. She seemed to\r\nbe grateful, for although they never had exchanged words, she smiled at\r\nhim and gave him very friendly glances at their chance meetings. There\r\ncould be no doubt concerning the relation of the beautiful page and his\r\nmaster. Heideck may have felt some jealousy--he hardly ever had seen a\r\nmore charming girl than this Circassian beauty in her picturesque dress;\r\nbut all his thoughts were with Edith. The Russian was indeed a lucky\r\nfellow to have found such a charming travelling companion. She never\r\nforgot her assumed part of the page, when strangers were near, and yet\r\nit was clear to Heideck that she in truth was master. A single glance of\r\nher flashing eyes was sufficient to keep the Prince in order, when under\r\nthe influence of intoxicants he would have otherwise given way to his\r\nbrutal instincts. In her presence he never dared to use ambiguous and\r\nfrivolous language.\r\n\r\nWith sincere regret Heideck saw the Prince depart. He did not share the\r\nhope, which the latter expressed to him, that they would meet again.\r\nBut he remembered him as one of his most interesting acquaintances and\r\na very charming comrade notwithstanding those little foibles he had\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nIt struck seven o’clock when Heideck in full evening dress entered the\r\nColonel’s drawing-room. He felt a wave of keen joy surging through him\r\nwhen he noticed that it was empty, except for Edith Irwin. The horrible\r\nevents she had passed through had left her a little pale. To him she\r\nseemed more beautiful than ever. She met him with a smile and gave him\r\nher hand, which he kissed with great emotion.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Baird and the Colonel beg to be excused for a quarter of an hour,”\r\n said she. “The Colonel has still much to do with the preparations for\r\nthe mobilisation. Mrs. Baird is suffering from one of her bad attacks of\r\nheadache and has had to lie down for a short time.”\r\n\r\nHeideck’s face told Edith clearly enough that he gladly forgave his\r\nhost and hostess this little impoliteness. After having taken a chair\r\nopposite hers, he began--\r\n\r\n“I hope most sincerely, Mrs. Irwin, that you have had no annoyance on\r\naccount of my late call. All day long yesterday this was on my mind.”\r\n\r\nWith a sad smile she replied, “No, no. On the contrary, my husband has\r\nasked me to tell you that he is very sorry not to be able to thank you\r\npersonally for your heroic behaviour. He hopes to be able to do so\r\nlater on. He has been ordered to go to Lahore in great haste and for an\r\nindefinite period. There was not time for him to see you, in order to\r\nthank you.”\r\n\r\nHeideck imagined that he knew what this order meant. But he only asked:\r\n“And are you going to stay on here under the protection of the Colonel?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing definite has been arranged as yet. Nobody knows what may happen\r\nto-morrow. It is certain that extraordinary events are in preparation.\r\nIn case of war, we poor women have to do as we are told, you know.”\r\n\r\n“And the Maharajah? You have not heard about him?”\r\n\r\n“Colonel Baird saw the Prince officially yesterday; but I do not know\r\nanything more; I had not the courage to ask. It seems to me quite\r\ncertain that the Maharajah is hostilely disposed towards the Colonel.\r\nThe event which happened here to-day is, I think, immediately to be\r\nconnected with the Maharajah. I know the ways of these Indian despots!”\r\n\r\n“May I venture to ask what has happened?”\r\n\r\n“An attempt to poison the Colonel at his own table.”\r\n\r\n“To poison the Colonel?” asked Heideck surprised.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Colonel Baird’s habit is to drink a tumbler of ice-water before\r\neach meal. To-day, at tiffin, the Indian butler gave it him as usual.\r\nThe water appeared to him rather cloudy. He did not drink it at once,\r\nand after a few minutes he noticed distinctly a white sediment at the\r\nbottom of the tumbler. When he called for the Indian butler, the man had\r\ndisappeared, and has not been found yet. That increased our suspicion\r\nthat an attempt at poisoning had been made. A small quantity of the\r\nfluid had been put into a dish which contained the food for the dogs.\r\nIt was then placed into a rat-trap which contained five or six of these\r\nravenous beasts. Ten minutes later they were dead. The remains of the\r\nwater have been given to Doctor Hopkins. He is going to make a chemical\r\nanalysis, and to tell us about it at dinner-time.”\r\n\r\nBefore Heideck could find the time again to resume the discussion of\r\nEdith’s personal affairs, Mrs. Baird came in, accompanied by the Colonel\r\nand his adjutant. They all shook hands with him in the most charming\r\nway, and after Doctor Hopkins had also arrived, a small man with a very\r\nvivacious manner, they went in to dinner.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Colonel would have preferred that nothing should be said in\r\nHeideck’s presence about the poisoning attempt. His wife’s impatience\r\nand excitement, however, could not be restrained.\r\n\r\n“Well, Doctor Hopkins,” she asked, “and what have you found?”\r\n\r\nThe Doctor evidently had been waiting for this.\r\n\r\n“One of the most deadly poisons the Indians know,” he answered. “The\r\ndiamond powder. There is no antidote for it, and it is impossible to\r\ntrace it in the body of the poisoned person, because it is of vegetable\r\nnature, and gets absorbed in the tissues.”\r\n\r\nA cry of horror escaped Mrs. Baird. She covered her eyes with her hand.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins continued: “I have never before come across the diamond\r\npowder, notwithstanding its use is said not to be uncommon. The\r\npreparation of it is a secret, anxiously guarded by the Indian\r\nphysicians. It seems to play the same part at the Courts of the Indian\r\nprinces that the celebrated ‘aqua tuffana’ did in the Middle Ages\r\namongst the Italian despots.”\r\n\r\nThese learned explanations of Doctor Hopkins were not adapted to raise\r\nthe spirits of the company. Everyone remembered that this horrible\r\nattempt had only been frustrated by a lucky chance. The Colonel,\r\nwho seemed to feel very uncomfortable on listening to the Doctor’s\r\nconversation, gave a sign to his wife to rise, rather sooner than usual.\r\n\r\nTea and drinks cooled in ice were served in the verandah, charmingly\r\nilluminated by coloured lamps. Heideck had only had eyes for Edith all\r\nthe evening. But he had avoided anxiously everything which might have\r\nbetrayed his feelings. And, even now, he would not have dared to join\r\nher in the half-dark corner of the verandah, where she had seated\r\nherself, unless she had called out to him asking him to take the empty\r\nseat at her side.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Heideck, here is another chair,” she said, in a perfectly natural\r\nvoice, drawing aside the pleats of her foulard skirt in order to let him\r\npass. Again their eyes met unnoticed by the others. The violent beating\r\nof his heart would have told him that he was entirely in the thraldom of\r\nthis beautiful young woman had he not known it already.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the well-known shouts and cries of Indian drivers were\r\nheard. The conversation stopped and everybody looked and observed with\r\nastonishment the curious procession of waggons which they could see\r\napproaching, as the night was pretty clear. The Colonel excepted, no one\r\nunderstood the meaning of this spectacle. There were five waggons\r\ndrawn by richly harnessed bullocks and escorted by a bodyguard of the\r\nMaharajah on horseback. Their captain rode till close to the verandah,\r\nthen dismounted, and went up the steps. His mien was distinguished,\r\nand at the same time dignified. He was young and handsome, with Greek\r\nfeatures and big, melancholy eyes. He wore a blouse of yellow silk, held\r\naround the waist by a shawl of violet silk, English riding-breeches,\r\nand high, yellow boots. A string of pearls was laid round his turban of\r\nviolet-striped silk, and diamonds, large as hazel-nuts, sparkled on his\r\nbreast as they caught the light of the lamp.\r\n\r\n“That is Tasatat Rajah, the cousin and favourite of the Prince,”\r\n whispered Edith, in answer to a question which she read in Heideck’s\r\nface. “No doubt the Maharajah is sending him with a special mission.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel had risen and gone to meet his visitor, but he neither shook\r\nhands with him nor asked him to be seated.\r\n\r\n“Greetings, long life and happiness, sahib, to you in the name of\r\nHis Highness,” he began with that noble air peculiar to the high-born\r\nIndian. “In token of his friendship and his respect he is sending you\r\na small gift. He hopes you will accept it as a proof that you have\r\nforgotten the conversation which you had yesterday with His Highness in\r\nconsequence of an unfortunate misunderstanding.”\r\n\r\n“His Highness is very kind,” was the Colonel’s answer, in a voice rather\r\nformal, “may I ask in what consists the present he is sending me?”\r\n\r\n“Every one of these five waggons, sahib, contains a hundred thousand\r\nrupees.”\r\n\r\n“That is as much as five lakhs?”\r\n\r\n“It is so. And I ask you once more kindly to favour His Highness with a\r\nreply.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel considered a moment, and then answered with the same quiet\r\ndemeanour and impenetrable expression, “Thanks to you, Prince. Have the\r\ncontents of these waggons carried into the hall. The Viceroy will decide\r\nwhat is to be done with it later on.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince’s face clearly showed his disappointment. For a little while\r\nhe remained there standing as if considering what to do. But recognising\r\nthat the Englishman wished to end the conversation, he touched the\r\nmiddle of his forehead with his right hand and descended the steps of\r\nthe verandah. With the assistance of English soldiers a great many small\r\ncasks were carried into the hall. The procession moved on again with\r\nthe same cries and shouts which had accompanied its approach and soon\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nA smile flitted across the Colonel’s face, erstwhile so unemotional,\r\nas he turned towards his guests, probably feeling that some sort of\r\nexplanation for his attitude was due to them.\r\n\r\n“I consider this half-million a very desirable acquisition towards the\r\nwar expenses of my detachment. But these Orientals never can understand\r\nour way of thinking, and our ideas of honour will always remain an\r\ninsoluble riddle to them. With a present, that he, of course, has meant\r\nfor me personally, this despot believes he has smoothed over everything\r\nthat could possibly spell trouble for him--the plot against Mrs. Irwin\r\nas well as the diamond powder business. For, of course, he has already\r\nbeen informed by the butler who has disappeared of the failure of his\r\nplot, and he is well aware of what is in store for him if I report the\r\nscandalous story to Calcutta.”\r\n\r\nIt was the first time the Colonel had openly declared his conviction\r\nthat the Maharajah was the author of both plots. No doubt he had\r\nespecial reasons for this, and Heideck fancied he had fathomed them,\r\nwhen, in reply to the question of the regimental surgeon as to his\r\nintention of sending in such a report, the Colonel replied--\r\n\r\n“I do not know--I really do not know yet. According to the principle,\r\nfiat justitia, pereat mundus, I ought to do so, no doubt. But the pereat\r\nmundus is, after all, a debatable point. Probably war is imminent, and\r\nI am afraid the Viceroy would not be grateful to me were I to add fresh\r\ncares to all his other anxieties. At present these Indian princes are\r\nindispensable to us. They have to place their troops at our disposal,\r\nand we must not have any enemies in the rear when our army is engaged\r\nin Afghanistan. A harsh procedure against one of them, and all these\r\nprinces might revolt. And a single defeat, or even only the false report\r\nof one, might entail incalculable consequences.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Hopkins assented without further discussion, and also the other\r\nofficers present shared the opinion of their chief. As usual, during\r\nthese last days a lively discussion had arisen as to the probabilities\r\nof war, and as to the probable course events would take. Heideck,\r\ncertain of learning nothing new from the mouths of these gentlemen, all\r\nso confident of victory, utilised the opportunity afforded by the noisy\r\nconversation to ask Edith, in a low voice--\r\n\r\n“Not only political considerations, but also your wishes, have\r\nprevented the Colonel from reporting the outrage of the other night to\r\nCalcutta--is it not so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I begged him not to do so,” she answered in the same low whisper.\r\n“But to-day, after the abominable plot upon his life, I told him that\r\nI do not ask any longer for any consideration to be shown me, or\r\nmy--husband.”\r\n\r\n“You seriously think it possible that Captain Irwin--”\r\n\r\n“Pray do not let us talk about it now, and not here, Mr. Heideck,” she\r\nbegged, raising her eyes to him imploringly. “You cannot have any idea\r\nhow terribly I suffer from these dreadful thoughts. I feel as if before\r\nme lay only dark, impenetrable night. And when I reflect that some day I\r\nmay be again forced--”\r\n\r\nShe did not finish her sentence, but Heideck knew well enough what she\r\nhad omitted to say. An irresistible impulse made him answer--\r\n\r\n“You must not allow yourself to be driven to take any course repugnant\r\nto your heart, Mrs. Irwin. And who is there who would dare to attempt to\r\nforce you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Heideck, you have no idea what regard for so-called ‘GOOD FORM’\r\nmeans for us English people. No scandal--for Heaven’s sake, no scandal!\r\nThat is the first and prime law of our Society. Kind as the Colonel and\r\nhis wife have been to me until now, I am very much afraid they would\r\ndrop me, without question of my guilt or innocence, if I should allow\r\nanything to take place which they consider a scandal.”\r\n\r\n“And yet you must obey solely your own feeling--only the commands of\r\nyour heart and conscience, Mrs. Irwin; not the narrow views of\r\nthe Colonel or any other person. You must not become a martyr to a\r\nprejudice--I simply cannot hear the idea. And you must promise me--”\r\n\r\nHe stopped short. A sudden lull in the general conversation caused him\r\nto be silent also. And he fancied he saw the intelligent and penetrating\r\neyes of Mrs. Baird directed upon himself with an expression of mistrust.\r\nHe was displeased with himself. Displeased, because the intoxicating\r\nproximity of the adored being, and his aversion for her husband, that\r\nhad almost increased to passionate hatred, had led him into the danger\r\nof compromising her. But when, soon afterwards, he took his leave,\r\ntogether with the other guests, a soft pressure of Edith’s hand gave him\r\nthe delightful assurance that she was far from being angry with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE MOBILISATION\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery day now brought fresh news, and the threatening spectre of war\r\ndrew nearer and nearer. The order for mobilisation had been given.\r\nThe field-troops were separated from the depot, destined to remain in\r\nChanidigot. The infantry were provided with ammunition, and were daily\r\nexercised in firing and bayonet drill. Horses were bought up and a\r\ntransport organised, which comprised an enormous number of camels. The\r\ncommissariat stores were replenished, and the officers eagerly studied\r\nthe maps of Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nAccording to Heideck’s ideas of mobilisation progress was much too slow,\r\nand the Maharajah appeared still less in a hurry with the equipment of\r\nhis auxiliary troops.\r\n\r\nMilitary trains from the South passed without cessation through\r\nChanidigot, carrying horses and troops further north. Their immediate\r\ngoal was Peshawar, where Lieutenant-General Sir Bindon Blood,\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Punjab Army Corps, had concentrated a large\r\nfield-army. Heideck noticed with surprise that the regiments which were\r\nbeing hurried up had been drafted from the most heterogeneous corps,\r\nso that, therefore, the tactical union of these corps, as well as their\r\norganisation, had been destroyed. No doubt the Government wished, at\r\nany cost, to mass large bodies of troops as rapidly as possible on the\r\nfrontier, and to this end left all calculation of later events out of\r\nconsideration. Viscount Kitchener, the Commander-in-Chief of India,\r\nas well as the Viceroy and the Cabinet Ministers in London, seemed to\r\nentertain no doubt that the English army would be victorious from\r\nthe very beginning, and could not possibly be forced to retire to the\r\nfortresses of the North-west provinces. The contempt with which the\r\nofficers in Chanidigot talked about the Russian army and the Afghans\r\nsufficiently confirmed this general belief.\r\n\r\nAt last it was clear that war had become a fait accompli. On the tenth\r\nday after the announcement of the Russian invasion of Afghanistan\r\nuncertainty was at an end.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet in London had inquired in St. Petersburg as to the meaning\r\nof that invasion, and it received the answer that Russia felt compelled\r\nto come to the rescue of the Ameer at his request, for the Afghan ruler\r\nwas anxious for his independence, in view of the measures which were\r\ntaken by England. Nothing was further removed from the intention of the\r\nRussian Government than to challenge England, but she felt it impossible\r\nto look on at the embarrassment of the Ameer with equanimity, and so\r\ndetermined to fight for the independence of Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nThereupon England declared war, and Lieutenant-General Blood received\r\nthe order immediately to advance through the Khyber Pass into\r\nAfghanistan. Further, Lieutenant-General Hunter, the Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the Bombay Army Corps, was ordered to march with an army from\r\nQuetta towards Kandahar. At the same time an English fleet was to leave\r\nPortsmouth.\r\n\r\nAlthough the English papers published in India had evidently been\r\ninstructed to maintain silence about matters which might place England\r\nin an unfavourable light, they furnished a good deal of news which gave\r\nthe intelligent reader all manner of clues as to the present warlike\r\nsituation. It could be seen that England was also arming against France.\r\nOnly as to the attitude of Germany in the universal war that threatened\r\nevery clue was wanting.\r\n\r\nThe intention of removing the families of the military and civil\r\nofficers, stationed in Chanidigot, south to Bombay, or to Calcutta in\r\nthe east, had soon been dropped. The spreading of the plague in both\r\ncities and the difficulties of the journey were against it; for the\r\nrailways were completely given over to the transport of troops. It\r\nwas determined that the women and children should, for the time being,\r\nremain with the depot in Chanidigot. Captain Irwin, who had returned\r\nfrom Lahore and who, apart from his duty, in which he displayed an\r\nalmost feverish zeal, led the life of a hermit, was appointed to\r\ncommand this depot. But his wife, whom he had not yet once met since his\r\narrival, was not to be placed with the others under his charge. Colonel\r\nBaird, who had given way to his wife’s urgent entreaties to be allowed\r\nwith her children to accompany him to Quetta, had asked Edith Irwin to\r\njoin them.\r\n\r\nOrders had been given that the detachment should start in conjunction\r\nwith the forces of the Maharajah of Chanidigot. Heideck had obtained\r\npermission to accompany it. The Colonel was well disposed towards him,\r\nand it was evidently pleasant for the former to have about him, as\r\nprotector to the ladies, such a chivalrous man, upon whom he could\r\nalways implicitly rely when his military duties prevented him from\r\nlooking after them. On the day preceding the start Heideck was at tiffin\r\nwith the Colonel, and coming events were being discussed in a serious\r\nmanner, when from outside the dull screech of an automobile’s horn\r\ncaught their ears. Two minutes later, covered with dust and with his\r\nface a dark red from the heat, an officer appeared on the verandah who\r\nintroduced himself as Captain Elliot, General Blood’s adjutant.\r\n\r\n“The General,” he said, adopting the proper military attitude, “has sent\r\nme to report that all the plans have been altered. Your orders are not\r\nto march to Quetta, but to hasten your preparations and start as soon as\r\npossible for Mooltan.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the reason for this change of orders?” asked the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“The Russians are coming down from the Hindu-Kush, and are marching down\r\nthe valley of the Indus, thus taking our army in the rear. General Blood\r\nis marching south, so as not to be cut off. I am sent round to direct\r\nall detachments upon Mooltan.”\r\n\r\n“No! is that possible? Is there not perhaps some mistake? How can the\r\nRussians cross the Hindu-Kush?”\r\n\r\n“I have myself seen Russian infantry in the gorges of the Indus Valley,\r\nColonel. The march upon Herat and the occupation of Cabul under General\r\nIvanov were mainly blinds. Ivanov, with twenty thousand men under his\r\ncommand, and reinforced by a like number of Afghans, is advancing from\r\nCabul upon the Khyber Pass. But the main attack will be made from the\r\nPamirs in the direction of Rawal-Pindi and Lahore.”\r\n\r\n“Rawal-Pindi?” exclaimed the Colonel. “If the Russians come down the\r\nIndus, they will first of all arrive at Attock, and this strong fortress\r\nwill check their advance long enough.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hope so, but we must not absolutely reckon upon it. The strength\r\nof the Russian army is not at present known to us; but their advance\r\nhas evidently been magnificently planned. Their engineers must have done\r\nperfect wonders in the difficult passes of the Hindu-Kush; and these\r\nRussian soldiers are like iron.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Colonel, “we will soon show them that we are of steel.”\r\n\r\nThe adjutant handed over the written instructions, and after having read\r\nthem, the Colonel replied--\r\n\r\n“To-morrow morning early I start for Mooltan, and expect to arrive there\r\nwith my detachment by tomorrow evening. The commissariat and ammunition\r\ncolumns will, of course, not be able to get there until a few days\r\nlater, and then only in part. What in all the world can have possessed\r\nthe General not to meet the enemy in Rawal-Pindi? That town is fortified\r\nand surrounded by strong forts; it is one of the greatest depots in\r\nIndia. Why must the General retire so far back, so far as Mooltan?”\r\n\r\n“The General is expecting a decisive battle, and intends for the purpose\r\nto co-operate with the army of General Hunter. But both armies are, at\r\npresent, equidistant from Mooltan, and the Russians would, the General\r\nthinks, hesitate to advance so far, from fear of having their left\r\nflank attacked from Lahore. In Lahore there is at present a force of ten\r\nthousand men, which is being reinforced every day from Delhi.”\r\n\r\nWith the departure of the adjutant, who, owing to the exigencies of\r\nduty, was obliged to decline the Colonel’s offer of a seat at table, the\r\nluncheon-party broke up, and the Colonel made apologies to his guest for\r\nbeing unable, under existing circumstances, to devote more time to him.\r\nHis officers accompanied him, and soon after Mrs. Baird was also called\r\naway. Quite unexpectedly Heideck and Edith Irwin found themselves alone.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments neither spoke, as though neither wished to give\r\nexpression to the feelings that filled their hearts. The young wife\r\nfirst broke silence.\r\n\r\n“You were intending to go with us into the field, Mr. Heideck, and I\r\nknow that your decision was prompted by a desire to assist us women with\r\nyour protection. But now all the arrangements are altered, and I beg of\r\nyou to abandon your intention.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her surprisedly. “What, Mrs. Irwin? do you intend to\r\ndeprive me of the pleasure I had looked forward to of accompanying you,\r\nand being your protector? And why?”\r\n\r\n“You also have just heard that all the arrangements are altered. Had we\r\ngone to Quetta, then, as soon as our army had crossed the frontier, you\r\nwould have been easily able to find another place; but if the battle\r\ntakes place on Indian soil you will find yourself in constant danger.”\r\n\r\n“In my quality as foreigner? Certainly. I should, under the\r\ncircumstances, be exposed to much unpleasantness, but before I change my\r\nplans, I should like to hear from you if you, too, intend to remain with\r\nthe troops under these altered conditions?”\r\n\r\n“Since Mrs. Baird has given me permission to accompany her, yes.”\r\n\r\n“And you believe that I shall show less courage than you, who will also\r\ncertainly be exposed to serious risks?”\r\n\r\n“How could I doubt your courage, Mr. Heideck? But that is, after all,\r\nsomething quite different. The place of us soldiers’ wives is at the\r\nside of our husbands, whom we have followed to India. And, moreover, we\r\nare, perhaps, nowhere safer than with the army. But you have no concern\r\nwith this war and with our army. If you, now, were to leave here to take\r\nup your quarters in one of the hill stations far from the seat of war,\r\nand where you were not exposed to the risks of battle and the plague,\r\nyou would be certainly allowed, as a German merchant, to remain there\r\nunmolested.”\r\n\r\n“And why do you not yourself go to such a hill station, Mrs. Irwin? I\r\nshould suggest Simla, if it were not so near to the seat of war. But\r\ndo, pray, go to Poona, or into one of the other mountain stations in the\r\nsouth.”\r\n\r\nThe young lady shook her head.\r\n\r\n“I expect that that would be going straight to destruction.”\r\n\r\n“And what, may I ask, makes you think this?”\r\n\r\n“I have already told you that in case of war English women are, here\r\nin India, only tolerably safe when in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\nsoldiers. If we were to be defeated, the revenge the people would\r\ntake on its oppressors would be terrible. Are you aware of the\r\ncruel instincts which slumber in these men, apparently so polite and\r\nsubmissive? The defenceless women and children would, without doubt, be\r\ntheir first victims. It was so in the Mutiny of 1857, and so it will be\r\nagain under similar conditions. Nana Sahib and his crew wallowed at\r\nthat time in the fiendish tortures of white women and children, and shed\r\nstreams of innocent blood. And the civilisation of the lower classes has\r\ncertainly since then not improved.”\r\n\r\n“You speak as if you considered a defeat of your army probable.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot get rid of my melancholy forebodings. And you, yourself,\r\nMr. Heideck--please be straightforward with me! When the adjutant was\r\nstanding there a little while ago, and when every one of his words\r\nshowed the want of circumspection in our generals, I watched your face,\r\nand I read more from its expression than you have any idea of. I will\r\nnot try to enter into your secrets, but I should be grateful if you\r\nwould be candid with me. You are not the person for whom you here give\r\nyourself out.”\r\n\r\nHe did not hesitate for a moment to confess to her the truth.\r\n\r\n“No, I am a German officer, and have been sent here by my superiors to\r\nstudy the Anglo-Indian army.”\r\n\r\nEdith’s surprise was evidently not great.\r\n\r\n“I had an inkling of it. And now please answer my question quite\r\nas straightforwardly. Do you believe that the British army will be\r\nvictorious?”\r\n\r\n“I would not permit myself to give an opinion on this point, Mrs.\r\nIrwin.”\r\n\r\n“But you must have an idea. And I would give a great deal to know what\r\nit is.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then--I believe in English bravery, but not in English victory.”\r\n\r\nShe heaved a deep sigh, but she nodded her head in assent, as if he had\r\nonly expressed her own conviction. Then she gave him her hand and said\r\nsoftly--\r\n\r\n“I thank you for your confidence, and as a matter of course no one shall\r\never learn from me who you are. But now I must insist more than ever\r\nthat you leave us for your own safety’s sake.”\r\n\r\n“And if I were to refuse? Supposing that in my position as soldier I\r\nwere to consider it to be my duty not to leave you in the lurch?\r\nWould you be angry with me? Would you no longer permit me to enjoy the\r\nhappiness of your society?”\r\n\r\nHer breast heaved, but she bowed her head and was silent. Heideck\r\nplainly saw the glistening tears which stole from under her eyelids, and\r\nslowly rolled down her delicate cheek.\r\n\r\nThat was answer enough for him. He bowed, and kissing both her hands,\r\nwhispered--\r\n\r\n“I knew that you would not be so cruel as to drive me from you. Wherever\r\nfate may lead me, it will find me at your side as long as you require my\r\nprotection.”\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds she let him keep her hand. She then gently withdrew it\r\nfrom his grasp.\r\n\r\n“I know that I ought to forbid you for your own safety to follow me;\r\nbut I have not the strength to do so. Heaven grant that you may never\r\nreproach me for having acted as I have done.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE CAMP OF LAHORE\r\n\r\n\r\nAn unusually beautiful and dry spring favoured the advance of\r\nthe Russian army through the mountains. In the north of India the\r\ntemperature kept at an average of 68 degrees F., and day after day the\r\nsun streamed down from a cloudless blue sky upon the broad plains of the\r\nPunjab, through the bright green of which the Russian troops, in their\r\nwhite summer uniforms, pushed on like long streaks of silver.\r\n\r\nEverything pointed to the fortune of war being on their side, for they\r\nhad overcome the difficult and dreaded passage at Attock with unexpected\r\nease.\r\n\r\nThe commander of this lofty fortress received orders not to break\r\ndown the bridge across the Indus until General Blood’s army, which was\r\ndirected to hold Peshawar and the Khyber Pass, had effected its retreat\r\nand had to the last man passed the river.\r\n\r\nThe bridge at Attock, which is a high structure built across the narrow\r\nbed of the Indus, which here foams down with swirling swiftness, is\r\nconsidered a masterpiece of engineering. It is built in two tiers, the\r\nupper of which carries the railway, while the lower forms a road for\r\ncarriages, beasts of burden, and foot-passengers. On either side of the\r\nriver is a fortified gate. The English commander of Attock trusted to\r\nthe strength of the forts standing some 800 feet above the river, and\r\nimagined the Russians to be still far away.\r\n\r\nThe Russian vanguard had crossed the river Cabul, which joins the Indus\r\nat Attock, at a point a few miles above the city, and thus appeared\r\nsimultaneously with General Blood’s troops before the fortress.\r\n\r\nBlood’s troops were passing the bridge in endless long columns. Their\r\nmovement was often checked by blocks, caused by the dislocation of\r\nthe several units, and so it came about that, in the early morning,\r\na superior Russian force had, unperceived by the English, reached the\r\nnorthern end of the bridge just as a gap had been caused in the English\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nThe thick fog of the morning had hidden the approach of the Russians\r\nfrom the English outposts. The Russians at once occupied the bridge, and\r\nso cut off the remainder of the English that were on the northern bank\r\nfrom their main body that had already crossed the bridge. The commander\r\nof the Russian advance guard was himself quite astounded at the success\r\nthat the fortune of war had thrown into his lap: had not the fog\r\nrendered the scouting on both sides illusory, and had not chance allowed\r\nhim to fall in with this gap in the English columns, the chances would,\r\nconsidering the narrowness of the road, have been much more favourable\r\nto the English than for him, and the battle would probably have ended\r\nwith the defeat of his forces. As it was, General Ivanov, who had\r\ncrossed the Khyber Pass, came upon the English rearguard, and five\r\nthousand men of the Anglo-Indian troops had to surrender after a short\r\nstruggle. Two thousand English and three thousand Mohammedans fell\r\ninto the hands of the Russians. As soon as the Mohammedan-Indians were\r\ninformed by the victors that they were fighting for the true faith\r\nagainst the infidels, they went over without more ado to the Russian\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe commander at Attock refused to surrender the fortress, and trained\r\nhis guns upon the Russian columns; but, in consequence of the fog, the\r\nbatteries did not inflict much damage upon the Russians, who being now\r\nin possession of the bridge continued their advance to the south.\r\n\r\nBut, however, before the march that had thus been so successfully begun\r\nwas continued, the Russian commander-in-chief collected, not far\r\nfrom Attock, all the troops that had crossed the Hindu-Kush in small\r\ndetachments, and united them with the army corps advancing from\r\nAfghanistan, so that he now disposed of an army of seventy thousand men.\r\n\r\nIt was a blood-stained road upon which this host travelled behind the\r\nretreating English army. This was the road upon which Alexander the\r\nGreat in days of yore entered India. Here, at the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century, the Afghan sovereign Ibrahim Lodi had fought with the\r\nGrand Mogul Baber; here, a few decades later, Mohammed Shah Adil, the\r\ngenerallissimo of the Afghans, when at the head of fifty thousand horse,\r\nfive hundred elephants, and innumerable infantry, was defeated by the\r\nyouthful Grand Mogul Akbar. Still more bloody was the battle, which\r\nabout the middle of the eighteenth century the Afghan Sultan Ahmed Shah\r\nDurani fought with the great Mahratha princes, Holkar Sindhia, Gaekwar\r\nand the Peschwas; and here, once again, all the horrors of war raged,\r\nwhen in the year 1857, the English Generals Havelock, Sir James Outram,\r\nSir Colin Campbell, Sir Hugh Rose, Sir John Lawrence, and Sir Robert\r\nNapier, crushed with pitiless severity the dangerous sepoy mutiny. East\r\nand West had, in gigantic struggles, fought together on this spot so\r\nfull of legends, this the cradle of mankind. Hundreds of thousands of\r\nhuman lives had been sacrificed on this blood-drenched soil, and yet\r\nagain was a decisive battle impending, destined to be engraved with a\r\nsteel pencil on the tablets of the world’s history.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the Russian army had upset the plan of the English\r\ngenerals. The English corps which had collected at Mooltan were quickly\r\npushed on to Lahore, as soon as the Russians’ intention to proceed to\r\nthe south-east became clear. The time which General Ivanov required for\r\nconcentrating his troops at Attock rendered it possible for the English\r\nto reach Lahore. Here their forces were considerably increased by the\r\nstrong garrison, and each day new regiments came in from Delhi and\r\nLucknow, which brought the strength of the army commanded by Sir Bindon\r\nBlood up to the number of one hundred thousand combatants.\r\n\r\nThe English prepared for a decisive battle, for already the head of\r\nthe Russian columns was no further than ten English miles north of\r\nthe mausoleum of the Emperor Jahangir at Shah Dara, a military station\r\nscarcely eight English miles north-west of Lahore.\r\n\r\nThe English troops advanced in their concentrated formation in single\r\nline; their left wing occupied the Shah Dara plantations and the pontoon\r\nbridge across the river Ravi that flows close to Lahore. It extended\r\nthence five English miles further eastwards to a canal which flows\r\npast the Shalimar Park towards the south. This park and a place called\r\nBhogiwal, lying next to it, formed the right wing. Before their front\r\nstretched a tributary of the sinuous Ravi with its marshy banks. To the\r\nrear of their position lay the fortress of Lahore with its brick wall,\r\nfifteen feet in height, pierced by thirteen gates.\r\n\r\nThe Ravi, a tributary of the Indus, had at this time but little water.\r\nThe bed of the river was for the most part dry, and only consisted of\r\nrapid, irregular rivulets, which here and there exposed between them\r\nlarger and smaller, but for the most part, muddy islands. The bed of\r\nthis river formed the chief obstacle to the Russian attack, for they had\r\nto pass it before reaching the English front and the city of Lahore.\r\n\r\nHeideck occupied a small tent that he had brought with him from\r\nChanidigot. Morar Gopal’s horse had carried it on its back during the\r\nmarch from Mooltan to Lahore, for the lancers, whom Heideck had joined\r\nas being a friend of their officers, had not covered the distance by\r\nrailway. They were now encamped in the Shalimar Park, an extensive\r\nenclosure surrounded by a wall and full of the most beautiful mango\r\ntrees, and among them many small fountains and pretty pavilions. As\r\nHeideck wore a khaki suit and a cork helmet, he looked, in spite of his\r\nhaving no distinctive military dress, quite like an English officer, the\r\nresemblance being increased by his martial bearing.\r\n\r\nDuring the march and during his stay in the camp he had had an\r\nopportunity of closely observing the British system of campaigning. But\r\nhe took good care not to mention it to the English officers, for they\r\nwere not very favourable conclusions at which he had arrived. He\r\nhad gained the impression that the troops were neither well led, nor\r\ndisplayed any special knowledge of campaigning. The men both in bivouac\r\nand in camp were often in want, and, indeed, frequently suffered real\r\ndistress, because the necessary material was not always at hand, and\r\ntheir food was not regularly supplied; the greatest confusion reigned in\r\nthe commissariat department.\r\n\r\nNot alone there, but also in the tactical units serious confusion was\r\neverywhere apparent, in consequence of the unpractical and heterogeneous\r\ncomposition of the detachments. First of all, the regiments which were\r\nto make up the army corps in Peshawar and Quetta were all jumbled up\r\ntogether, because as soon as ever they appeared to be ready to march,\r\nthey were separately taken away from their garrisons and placed upon the\r\nrailway. Concentration upon Mooltan and the hurried march to Lahore had\r\nresulted in downright inextricable confusion.\r\n\r\nHeideck found himself in the middle of an army which had never engaged\r\nin a great war and certainly never in one against regular troops. It\r\nis true that the English were accustomed to fighting, for they had\r\nbeen constantly obliged to measure themselves with barbarous and\r\nsemibarbarous peoples. They had made expensive expeditions and gained\r\ndearly purchased victories; but it was always the undisciplined,\r\ndark-skinned, and black hordes with whom they had had to deal. The\r\nexperiences of the Boer War had not entered into the flesh and blood\r\nof the troops. The personal bravery of the individual had almost always\r\nbeen regarded as the main thing, and it was easy to understand why all\r\nthe officers should be puffed up with vanity. They looked down with\r\ncontempt upon all foreigners, because they had, as a matter of fact,\r\nalmost always gained their victories over superior numbers.\r\n\r\nHeideck noticed with astonishment that the tactical rules and\r\ninstructions in the British army were still often at variance with\r\nmodern armament, particularly in the case of the infantry; volley firing\r\nwas habitually employed as the general way of engaging the enemy. The\r\nmen were drilled at the word of command to open and keep up a steady\r\neven fire and then in close ranks to rush with the bayonet on the enemy.\r\nThis powerful nation was, in fact, too listless to utilise the most\r\nmodern experiences of the science of war: proud Albion blindly believed\r\neverything English to be good and despised everything new and foreign.\r\nOr did the English perhaps only avoid advancing in loose order in\r\naction because they were afraid that they would otherwise not be able to\r\ncontrol their Indian soldiers?\r\n\r\nThe environs of Lahore, particularly to the north of the city between\r\nthe wall and the camp, presented a very lively scene. The innumerable\r\ncamels which had served as baggage animals and formed the major portion\r\nof the transports afforded a very peculiar spectacle. They were either\r\nlying on the ground closely packed together or solemnly paced along,\r\nwhile the shrill yells of the drivers filled the air. Moreover, there\r\nwas here congregated a huge crowd of men belonging to the army in one or\r\nother capacity without being combatants, and the eye fond of picturesque\r\nimpressions could feast with delight on the gay, ever-changing\r\nkaleidoscopic effects of the wide plain; while the distant scenery was\r\nalso interesting enough in itself. Between the widely scattered villages\r\nand suburbs of the city, which contained 180,000 inhabitants, beautiful\r\nparks and gardens shone in fresh green foliage, mostly surrounding\r\nthe burial-place of a sultan or a famous Mohammedan saint. Towards the\r\nsouth-east there stretched away the great encampments of the cavalry and\r\nartillery in which were included many elephant batteries.\r\n\r\nThe city itself was choked full of military and the families of the\r\nofficers. Almost all the women and children of the garrisons lying to\r\nthe north-west of Lahore had fled here at the advance of the troops.\r\nMrs. Baird, too, with her two little daughters and Mrs. Irwin were also\r\nin the city, where they were lodged in the Charing Cross Hotel. Although\r\nthe city was packed to a most alarming degree and the military situation\r\nwas decidedly critical, Heideck did not anywhere observe any particular\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nThe English preserved their peculiarly calm demeanour, and the natives\r\nkept silence out of fear: upon the latter the fully unexpected and\r\nincomprehensible change in the situation had probably had a certain\r\nbewildering effect.\r\n\r\nWhen Heideck, shortly before sunset, went from the camp to the city to\r\nvisit the ladies, he only became more firmly convinced, as he passed\r\nthrough the surging crowd outside the walls, that the position of the\r\narmy had been very badly selected. Far too large a number of men and\r\nanimals had been crowded within a comparatively small space. If Russian\r\nshrapnel were to fall among this dense mass a terrible panic was\r\ninevitable. The proximity of the fortified city was sure to induce\r\nthe soldiers to take refuge behind its walls. Heideck had hitherto not\r\ngained the impression that resolute courage was to be expected of the\r\nnative soldiers. In the street which led from the Shalimar Park to the\r\nrailway station in the suburb of Naulakha, Heideck had constantly to\r\ngo out of his way to allow the long columns of heavily laden camels and\r\nox-waggons which came towards him to pass, and he therefore took nearly\r\ntwo hours to reach his goal. The Charing Cross Hotel was full up to the\r\nattics, and the two ladies had, with the children, to be content with a\r\nsmall room on the third floor which had been let to them at an enormous\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Baird, a lady of small, delicate build, but of energetic spirits\r\nand genuine English pride, appeared perfectly collected and confident.\r\nShe did not utter a single word about her own evidently very\r\nuncomfortable position and of the privations which, under the existing\r\ncircumstances, her children had to suffer, but only about the victory of\r\nthe British arms, that she was convinced would immediately take place.\r\nThe march from Mooltan to Lahore was, in her eyes, an advance, and she\r\ndid not entertain the smallest doubt that the Russian insolence would in\r\na short time meet with terrible chastisement.\r\n\r\n“It is terrible to think,” she said to Heideck, “that a nation that\r\ncalls itself Christian should dare attack us in India. What was this\r\nunhappy land before we took pity on it? England has freed it from the\r\nhands of barbarous despots and brought it happiness! The Indian cities\r\nhave grown in prosperity because our laws have paved the way for free\r\ndevelopment of commerce and intercourse. It is in the highest sense of\r\nthe word a mission of civilisation that our nation has here fulfilled.\r\nIf Heaven gives Russia the victory, this now so happy land will be\r\nhurled back into the blackness of barbarism.” She appeared to wait for a\r\nword of assent from Mrs. Irwin, but the latter sat in serious silence.\r\n\r\n“You ought not to be so silent, dearest Edith, and ought not to pull\r\nsuch a melancholy face,” said the Colonel’s wife, turning to her with\r\na gentle reproach. “I perfectly understand that the sad events of your\r\nprivate life are distressing you. But all personal sorrow should now be\r\nmerged into the general grief. What is the fate of the individual, when\r\nhis country is exposed to such danger? I know that you are as good a\r\npatriot as any Englishwoman, but it appears to me that it is necessary\r\nto prove it in these hours of danger. Anxiety and moroseness have at\r\nsuch times upon one’s surroundings the effect of a contagious disease.”\r\n\r\n“But possibly I am not the good patriot you take me for.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! What do you mean by that?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot look at wars from your point of view, dear Mrs. Baird. It\r\nalmost seems to me that there is not a very great difference between men\r\nand brute beasts, who fight each other out of hunger, or jealousy, and\r\nall kinds of low instincts.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a comparison to draw!”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is true we know better how to wage war. We invent complicated\r\ninstruments wherewith to destroy our fellow-beings in enormous numbers,\r\nwhilst animals are limited to their own natural weapons. But do we,\r\ntherefore, know better what we are doing than the animals? Don’t you\r\nthink that, when hosts of ants, or bees, or weasels, or fishes in the\r\nsea sally forth to destroy other creatures of their species, they may be\r\nguided perhaps by the same instincts that govern us also?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot follow you there, Mrs. Irwin,” the little lady replied, with a\r\nshade of irritation in her voice. “Human beings are endowed with reason,\r\nand are conscious of their aims and actions.”\r\n\r\n“Is it really so reasonable when peasants and labourers go to war as\r\nsoldiers? Are they really led by a conscious purpose within them? None\r\nof them has anything to gain. They are compelled by others to allow\r\nthemselves to be maimed and killed, and to kill their fellow-beings. And\r\nthe survivors are in no respects better off, after gaining a victory,\r\nthan they were before. And the leaders themselves? In the morals of\r\nChristian faith honours, orders, and endowments are only idle toys.\r\nLet us be honest, Mrs. Baird. Did England conquer India in order to\r\npropagate the Christian gospel? No! We have shed rivers of blood solely\r\nin order to spread our commerce, and in order to increase the wealth of\r\na few, who themselves wisely remained at a safe distance from the fray,\r\nin the possession of luxury beyond the dreams of avarice.”\r\n\r\n“It is sad to hear such words from the mouth of an Englishwoman.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation was in danger of taking a critical turn, as the\r\nColonel’s wife felt seriously annoyed and wounded by Edith’s words.\r\nHeideck turned the discussion into a less dangerous channel. Soon\r\nafterwards the Colonel arrived; he occupied a tent further away in the\r\ncamp, and only rarely found time to look after his family.\r\n\r\nHe simulated an air of gaiety and composure which he was far from\r\nfeeling, and he was too indifferent an actor to succeed in his part.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry, but I can only stay a very short time,” he said, when he\r\nhad caressed and kissed the little girls, whom he loved so tenderly,\r\nwith still greater affection than usual. “My chief object in coming\r\nwas to instruct you, dear Ellen, what you have to do in case we have to\r\nretire.”\r\n\r\n“To retire--? For Heaven’s sake--I hope there is no question of\r\nretiring!”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel smiled, though not quite naturally.\r\n\r\n“Of course, we cannot reckon with certainty upon victory. He would be a\r\nbad general who did not consider the possibility of defeat. During the\r\nlast few hours all our dispositions have been altered. We are on the\r\npoint of starting to attack the Russians.”\r\n\r\n“That is right!” cried Mrs. Baird, with bright eyes. “A British army\r\nmust not wait for the enemy, but go and meet him.”\r\n\r\n“We shall march out at early dawn to try and prevent the Russians from\r\ncrossing the Ravi. The engineers leave to-night in advance to destroy\r\nthe bridges, if it is not already too late. The army has to execute a\r\nconsiderable movement to the left about, in order to reach the right\r\nposition. At the same time the front has to be extended and lengthened\r\nto the right. The left wing remains at Shah Dara and the pontoon\r\nbridge.”\r\n\r\n“Is it not possible for us to come out also and look on at the battle?”\r\n inquired Mrs. Baird. But her husband shook his head in decided refusal.\r\n\r\n“For you, dearest Ellen, our trustworthy Smith will have a cart, with\r\ntwo strong oxen, ready here in the hotel. That is to provide for all\r\neventualities. Should you receive news that the army is retreating upon\r\nLahore--which the Lord forbid--you must lose not a minute, but drive\r\nas quick as possible, before the crush at the gates and in the streets\r\nbegins, through the Akbari gate over the canal bridge leading to the\r\nSadrbazar, and so to Amritsar, where you may be able to take the railway\r\nto Goordas. All other lines are closed for other than military purposes.\r\nPanic will not extend so far as that, and there, in any small hill\r\nstation, you will find a safe resting-place for the present. And now,\r\nMr. Heideck, may I trouble you by asking a great favour of you?”\r\n\r\n“I am entirely at your disposal, Colonel.”\r\n\r\n“Stop here in the hotel--try to obtain the latest intelligence as to the\r\ncourse of events, and act as protector to the ladies and children until\r\nthey are in security. If you will permit me to hand you a cheque--”\r\n\r\n“Please leave that for the present, Colonel,” Heideck replied. “I am\r\nprovided with plenty of money and will render you an account later. I\r\npromise to protect your family and Mrs. Irwin as well as I can. But\r\nI think it would be better for me not to remain in the town, but to\r\naccompany the troops. I will return as soon as possible should\r\nevents take an unfavourable turn. The anxiety of the ladies would be\r\nunnecessarily increased, and I myself should be uncertain as to what to\r\ndo if we received unreliable news here in the hotel as to the position\r\nof affairs.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said the Colonel, after a moment’s hesitation. “Already\r\nnow the most absurd rumours are flying about. Leaflets have been\r\ndistributed amongst our Mohammedan troops inciting them with the maddest\r\nand most deceitful promises to desert from the British army. A few\r\npersons, taken whilst distributing such leaflets, have been already\r\nshot without more ado. I leave everything to your circumspection and\r\ndecision. In any case, it will be best for you to keep as near to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief as possible. My permit will open the road to you\r\neverywhere. I will thank you later on.”\r\n\r\nHe shook Heideck’s hand warmly, and embraced his wife and his children\r\nonce more, and the two men turned to leave. The dull foreboding that it\r\nwas a parting for ever lay heavily upon all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Heideck returned to the camp, the road was lit up by the red glare\r\nof innumerable fires. On the wide plain, stretching between the town and\r\nriver, work was going on in feverish haste. Rations and ammunition were\r\nbeing dealt out, and long lines of beasts of burden were in motion.\r\nThousands of hands were busily employed in trying to facilitate the\r\npassage of the troops across the shallow tributary of the Ravi. The\r\nboggy places were made firm by a covering of palm branches and leaves;\r\nand logs of wood were got ready in hot haste for the artillery.\r\nHeideck could not help wondering why it was that the army had not been\r\nconcentrated from the first at the point the battle was to take place.\r\nThe approach through the difficult tract of land, in connexion with the\r\ncontemplated movement to the left, made calls upon the endurance of\r\nthe troops that could not but have the most detrimental effect upon the\r\nissue of the battle.\r\n\r\nHe met his Indian boy, evidently in great excitement, in front of his\r\ntent.\r\n\r\n“When we start to-morrow we shall leave the tent with everything in it,”\r\n said Heideck. “You will ride my horse and I shall take yours.”\r\n\r\nMorar Gopal was a Hindu from the south, almost as black as a nigger, a\r\nsmall, agile little man, weighing scarcely eight stone. It was in order\r\nto save his own horse for the later exertions of the day that Heideck\r\nwanted his boy to ride him at first.\r\n\r\nOnly now he perceived that his servant, contrary to his usual habit, was\r\narmed. He carried a sword buckled round his waist, and when asked the\r\nreason, the Indian answered, with a certain amount of pathos--\r\n\r\n“All Hindus will die to-morrow, but I at least will defend myself\r\nbravely.”\r\n\r\n“What makes you believe that all Hindus must die to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sahib! me know it well. The Mohammedans hate the Hindus, and they\r\nwill kill all of us tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“But this is nonsense. Mohammedans and Hindus will unite as one man to\r\nfight the Russians to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThe Indian shook his head.\r\n\r\n“No, sahib! The Russians also are Mohammedans.”\r\n\r\n“Whoever told you so lied. The Russians are Christians, like the\r\nEnglish.”\r\n\r\nBut however great his confidence in his master might be in general, this\r\ntime Morar Gopal evidently did not believe him.\r\n\r\n“If they are Christians, why, then, should they wage war against other\r\nChristians?”\r\n\r\nHeideck saw that it would be impossible to explain these things, that\r\nwere beyond his own comprehension, to the dark-skinned lad. And only a\r\nfew hours of the night still remaining for sleep, he despatched him to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nThe first rays of the sun had begun to quiver over the wide plain when\r\nthe forward march commenced. Heideck, already before dawn of day, was\r\nin the saddle, and found time to exchange a few words with Colonel Baird\r\nbefore setting out.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel occupied that day a position of great importance and\r\nresponsibility. He commanded a brigade, consisting of two English and\r\none sepoy regiments, the lancers, and a battery. In addition, he was in\r\ncommand of the auxiliaries sent by the Maharajah of Chanidigot, and led\r\nby Prince Tasatat, consisting of one thousand infantry, five hundred\r\ncavalry, and one battery. The Prince rode out magnificently attired and\r\narmed; the hilt and scabbard of his sword sparkled with precious stones,\r\nand a cockade of valuable diamonds flashed from his turban. The bridling\r\nand caparison of his mount, a splendid chestnut, represented alone a\r\nsmall fortune. His troops were also splendidly equipped, and displayed\r\ngreat confidence. The horsemen carried long pikes, like the English\r\nlancers, and wore red turbans, striped with blue. But many had been\r\nobliged to enter the lines of infantry in spite of their heavy boots,\r\nsince a great number of horses, of the Mohammedan as well as the English\r\ncavalry, had died in consequence of bad fodder and over-exertion.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the British army was rather complicated. The English\r\nforces were massed in two divisions between Shah Dara and the park\r\nof Shalimar. The first comprised the Indian troops, officered by\r\nEnglishmen; the second the English regiments. In this way seventy-five\r\nthousand Indians were to be prevented from running away. Should the\r\nfirst division be compelled to fall back, it would be checked by the\r\ntwenty-five thousand English. The advance march was commenced in such\r\nfashion that the right half of the line of battle, sweeping far round to\r\nthe right, executed a left wheel, and in this way lengthened the front\r\nby about one-third; this was done in order to fill up the gap caused in\r\nthe centre. The second division was pushed forward into the first, and\r\nnow formed the centre of the line of battle. At the same time a new\r\nsecond division was formed by leaving in reserve troops of the advancing\r\ndivisions and massing them behind the left wing of the entire position;\r\nthe English considered their left wing to be most threatened. Colonel\r\nBaird, with his brigade, occupied the centre of the front line of the\r\nmain position.\r\n\r\nHeideck watched many Indian regiments march past, and he could not\r\nhelp perceiving the difference of mood and carriage of Mohammedans and\r\nHindus. Whilst the first maintained a very energetic and very frequently\r\ncheerful attitude, the latter allowed the ends of their turbans to hang\r\nloose, as a sign of their despair, and marched dejectedly forward, face\r\nand head covered with ashes. Morar Gopal’s conception of the fate in\r\nstore for all Hindus evidently was shared by all.\r\n\r\nThe wide plain was covered with marching columns of infantry, hosts\r\nof cavalry, and heavy, thudding artillery. Whilst the English foot\r\nsoldiers, in their yellow-brown khaki dress, were hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom the colour of the ground, the cavalry regiments and the troops of\r\nthe Indian princes looked like gaily coloured islets in the vast and\r\nsurging sea of the army as it advanced in two divisions.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the Colonel’s wish, Heideck kept close to the side of\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, whose numerous staff and retinue of servants,\r\nhorses, and carriages allowed him to mix in the crowd without attracting\r\nattention. But the General did not remain long with the centre. In\r\norder to gain a clearer survey of the entire movement, and to be able\r\nto observe the Russian approach, he rode with his staff and a strong\r\ncavalry escort towards the Ravi river. Heideck, accompanied by his\r\nfaithful servant, attached himself to the escort, and thus was soon far\r\nin advance of Colonel Baird’s brigade.\r\n\r\nNothing was as yet to be seen of the Russians, and about three hours\r\nmight have passed since the beginning of the advance march, when lo!\r\nthe dull, rumbling thunder of the first cannon-shot rolled over the wide\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThe General reined in, and directed his field-glasses upon the left\r\nwing, where the cannonade increased in violence each minute. Another\r\nhalf-hour and the sharp rattle of infantry fire mixed with the heavy\r\nrumbling of big guns. No doubt, on the left wing, by Shah Dara, the\r\nbattle had commenced. Advancing towards the right bank of the Ravi, the\r\nRussians threatened to attack Lahore.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief despatched two orderly officers to the right wing\r\nand the centre, with the order to accelerate the march. Then he returned\r\nwith his suite to his former position.\r\n\r\nBut Heideck could not at once make up his mind to follow. From the\r\nmoment the first shot had been fired the battle fever had seized him; he\r\nwas only a soldier now.\r\n\r\nHe was irresistibly attracted by a building a short distance away, with\r\na slender minaret, from which he hoped to obtain a better view. It was\r\nthe half-decayed mausoleum of some saint, and Heideck had some trouble\r\nto climb up to the top of the minaret, a height of about twenty feet,\r\nwhilst his servant waited with the horses down below. But the exertion\r\nwas fully rewarded. He overlooked the flat plains. The sinuous Ravi\r\nriver was hardly half an English mile distant. Its banks were covered\r\nwith high grass and thick jungle growth; on the other side of the river\r\nimmense thickly-packed masses of troops appeared--the advancing Russian\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nBoth armies must soon come into collision by the river, for single\r\nEnglish cavalry regiments and horse artillery batteries, advancing in a\r\nlong line, were already in its immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nHeideck had seen sufficient to be able to judge of the position of the\r\nbattle. He climbed down the minaret and mounted his fresh steed, whilst\r\nMorar Gopal sprang into the saddle of his own horse. They quickly\r\narrived amongst the British cavalry, deploying in advance of their main\r\narmy. The advance march was now executed with greatest rapidity. The\r\nEnglish batteries dashed forward at the fastest pace the soft ground\r\nwould permit, unlimbered, and opened fire. Large masses of infantry\r\nmarched towards the jungle. But from the other side of the river the\r\nlively English fire was but feebly returned. Only from the direction of\r\nthe left English wing, invisible from this point, did the artillery and\r\ninfantry fire rage with unabated violence.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, considerable reinforcements were sent to the apparently\r\nhard-pressed left wing, and a distinct weakening of the centre took\r\nplace, without a clear idea having been formed as to the intention of\r\nthe Russians. Heideck’s conviction was that such probably had been the\r\nRussian tactics. He was of opinion that they probably raised a great\r\nbattle din by Shah Dara, in order to direct the attention of the English\r\nto that point, and then deliver their main attack against the centre.\r\nHe was right; the main forces of the Russians were opposed to Colonel\r\nBaird.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance he could not explain was the curious fact that\r\nthe English as well as the Indian infantry regiments halted before the\r\njungle instead of pushing forward to the river. Not even riflemen were\r\nsent into it, although the bush was by no means too thick for a chain\r\nof riflemen to take cover. The prickly bushes on the river’s bank were\r\nsparse enough, and the high grass reaching up to the mens’ shoulders\r\nwould have made a splendid hiding-place.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by the English army had executed the movement to the left, and\r\nnow stood facing the Russian front. One new regiment after the other was\r\ndrawn from the second division and placed on the left wing, which was\r\nbelieved to be most threatened. The English guns thundered without\r\ninterruption, but their position might have been better; many fired\r\nwithout being able to see the enemy at all through the thick jungle, and\r\nthrew away their ammunition prematurely.\r\n\r\nThe sun shone brightly in the cloudless sky. A slight north-westerly\r\nbreeze coming from the far distant hills blew the smoke of the powder in\r\nclouds back on the English army.\r\n\r\nThe enemy being thus completely shrouded from view, the infantry stood\r\nmotionless. A sullen expectation brooded over the colossal forces,\r\nwho realised danger, but were yet condemned to a torturing inactivity.\r\nSuddenly the wild roar of thousands of voices rose from the river, and\r\nhosts of cavalry, which before could have been held back by English\r\ninfantry, broke through the jungles like immense swarms of locusts.\r\nThousands of wild Afghans and warriors from Bukhara, Samarcand, Khiva,\r\nand Semiryechensk, combined in the Turkestan divisions, had crossed\r\nthe river and, wildly crying “Allah! Allah!” hurled themselves upon the\r\nEnglish battalions and batteries. Splendidly trained at firing from the\r\nsaddle, they were terrible foes indeed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the English returned the unexpected attack with crackling\r\nvolleys, and did not recoil a hair’s breadth from their positions, the\r\nRussian lines suffered but small losses in consequence of their open\r\norder. One new swarm after the other broke through the jungle, and\r\nrushed like an army of devils upon the batteries. A few of these were\r\nsilenced; the men who served them were killed before they were able to\r\nturn their guns against their assailants, so wildly rapid had been this\r\nsurprise rush of the bold horsemen.\r\n\r\nThe English cavalry, advancing to a magnificent attack, arrived too\r\nlate; the weight of the shock was lost, the enemy having already\r\ndispersed in all directions. These men understood how to manage their\r\nsmall, rapid horses in a marvellous manner. They seemed like centaurs,\r\nand the rapidity with which they broke up their squadron, in order\r\nimmediately after to close up again at another place in dense masses,\r\nrendered a counter attack on the part of the serried ranks of their\r\nadversaries almost impossible.\r\n\r\nAt one time, Heideck, with that part of the staff to which he had\r\nattached himself, had been drawn into the shock of battle. He had been\r\nobliged to shoot an Afghan, who attacked him, down from his horse, and\r\nhe would probably, a moment afterwards, have been laid low by the\r\nsabre of another, had not the faithful Morar Gopal, who displayed\r\nextraordinary courage, just at the right moment made the horseman\r\nharmless by a well-directed blow of his sword. The cavalry engagement\r\nwas still undecided, when lo! in the grass before the jungle were seen\r\na number of glittering sparks. The sharp crack of shots was heard, and\r\ntheir destructive effect showed how admirably the Russian riflemen, who\r\nwere gradually advancing against the British army, knew how to\r\nhandle their rifles. The British infantry kept on discharging volleys\r\nindefatigably, but no practical result of all this waste of ammunition\r\nwas apparent. Their targets were too small and too scattered, and the\r\nmechanical volleys fired at the word of command had but little effect.\r\nBesides this, the Russians had admirable cover, with the variegated\r\njungle as a background, whilst the English stood out sharply against the\r\nhorizon, and presented an excellent mark. According to their plan,\r\nthe Russians first of all directed their fire against the men who\r\nwere serving the batteries. Their well-directed shooting decimated the\r\nEnglish artillery to a terrible degree. Scarcely two minutes had elapsed\r\nbefore the order was given to fall back with the guns. As far as was\r\npossible, the English harnessed up, and galloped off to take up their\r\nposition between the infantry battalions, and from there again to\r\nopen fire. The advance of the English artillery, which had taken place\r\ncontrary to orders, and which was a result of their over-hasty forward\r\nmovement, thus showed itself to have been a most disastrous step.\r\n\r\nAn even stronger and more damaging effect than that of the attack\r\nitself, was produced by the ceaseless cries of “Allah! Allah!” which\r\nproceeded from the Afghans and the Turkestan cavalry, and penetrated\r\nto the Mohammedans who stood in the British lines. Heideck saw quite\r\nclearly that, here and there, the Indian soldiers ceased firing as if\r\nin obedience to a word of command, and could distinguish how English\r\nofficers in their excitement struck the men with the flat of the sword\r\nand threatened them with the revolver. Obviously, the leaders had lost\r\nall influence over the foreign elements under their command. Close to\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief an English captain was bayoneted by an Indian\r\nsoldier, and there could be no doubt that similar cases of open mutiny\r\ntook place amongst the other Indian troops.\r\n\r\nThe men, who had only followed the orders of the foreign tyrants with\r\nthe utmost reluctance, evidently believed the moment had come for\r\nshaking off the hated yoke, and at the same time the old enmity between\r\nthe Mohammedans and Hindus, the rivalry between the two religions, which\r\noften in times of peace occasioned bloody feuds, burst into open flames.\r\nIn the midst of the British army duels to the death were fought out\r\nbetween the irreconcilable adversaries. Thus it was unavoidable that the\r\nentire discipline became shaken and destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe battlefield was an awful spectacle. Before the front innumerable\r\nwounded, crying out for help, where no help was possible, were writhing\r\nin agony, for the retreat of the English artillery had had to be\r\nexecuted without thought of those left behind; wounded horses, wildly\r\nkicking to free themselves from their harness, increased the horror of\r\nthe terrible scene, whilst stray divisions of English cavalry riding\r\namongst them were fired upon by their own infantry out of fear of\r\nthe advance of the Russian riflemen. Although in war all battlefields\r\npresent a spectacle of the utmost horror, so that only the excitement\r\nof the moment enables human beings to endure it, yet the picture this\r\nbattle of the advanced lines presented surpassed all imagination. The\r\nwant of discipline amongst the English lines increased more and more,\r\nand the English officers had to fix their whole attention upon their own\r\ntroops, instead of upon the movements of the enemy. The necessity for\r\nthis was soon evident.\r\n\r\nPrince Tasatat was the first to leave Colonel Baird with his entire\r\nforce, and openly to march over to the enemy. His example was decisive\r\nfor the Indians who were still hesitating, and the number of those going\r\nover to the enemy increased from minute to minute.\r\n\r\nA uniform control of the line of battle had long since become\r\nimpossible. Colonel Baird gave orders for his guns to open fire upon\r\nPrince Tasatat’s company, and, like him, many other commanders fought\r\ntheir own individual battle just as their own judgment prompted. Indian\r\nregiments dispersed in all directions, because the men cared less for\r\nfighting than for getting booty from the prisoners and wounded. There\r\nwere hand-to-hand fights in many parts of the battlefield, which, owing\r\nto the fanatical rage of the combatants, degenerated into horrible\r\nbutchery. Those falling into the hands of the Afghans were most to be\r\npitied. For these devils in human shape cut off the heads of all their\r\nprisoners and all wounded, whether Mohammedans, Hindus, or English,\r\nwithout any further ado, and in their rapacity tore the valuables from\r\nthe bodies of the dead and wounded.\r\n\r\nA line of fugitives, like an immense stream, passed the English\r\nregiments, which still stood firm in serried ranks, making for the plain\r\nof Lahore, in order to find protection behind the walls of the fortified\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIn Heideck’s opinion the day was lost to the English, and he prepared\r\nhimself to die a soldier’s death, together with the brave men\r\nsurrounding him. With feelings of sincerest admiration he confessed how\r\ngreat was the bravery, and how admirable the discipline that animated\r\nthe English-born troops. Those regiments and batteries in which no\r\nnative elements were mingled, stood calm and unshaken amongst all the\r\nterrible confusion, and thanks to their bravery, the battle, which\r\nopened in such disorder, began to present clear features, like those of\r\nthe sharp peaks of a chain of mountains appearing above the mist, as it\r\nrolls down.\r\n\r\nInstead of the semibarbarous horsemen that had opened the attack,\r\nnew Russian batteries and colossal masses of infantry, with compact\r\ncompanies of riflemen, as well as several regiments of dragoons, now\r\nfaced the English troops.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief, with about 6,000 men and two batteries, was with\r\nthe second English division, which had been greatly reduced in numbers.\r\nIt was evidently his object to retire in good order towards Lahore, and\r\nto cover the retreat with his best troops.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded in withdrawing two smaller bodies from the right and left\r\nwing respectively by despatching orderlies. But the first division was\r\nso closely engaged with Russian infantry that an orderly retreat was\r\nalmost impossible.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, the Commander was bent on making the attempt to\r\nwithdraw also the first division of his army. He despatched one of his\r\nadjutants to Colonel Baird, who still had perhaps about 2,000 men under\r\nhis command, with the order to break off the battle and to retire. The\r\nyoung officer saluted with grave face, drew his sword, and galloped\r\naway. But he had only traversed a small part of his dangerous journey,\r\na distance of about a mile, when he fell a victim to the call of duty,\r\nbeing attacked and hurled from the saddle by a body of Cossacks mounted\r\non small, rough-haired, but very swift steeds.\r\n\r\nThe General appeared undecided whether to stake another young life on\r\nthis hopeless test. Heideck rode up to him and lifted his hand to his\r\nhelmet.\r\n\r\n“Will Your Excellency allow me to ride? I am a friend of Colonel Baird\r\nand should be glad of the opportunity of showing him my gratitude for\r\nhis kindness to me.”\r\n\r\nThe General sharply scrutinised the gentleman who was unknown to him,\r\nwho looked like an officer, though not wearing the prescribed uniform;\r\nbut he did not take the time to question him.\r\n\r\n“Ride!” he said shortly. “The Colonel is no longer to hold out; he is to\r\nmarch to the right and retreat towards Lahore--if possible.”\r\n\r\nHeideck saluted and turned his horse. He had replaced his revolver in\r\nhis belt, and returned his sword to its sheath.\r\n\r\nNot by the aid of weapons, but solely by the rapidity of his horse could\r\nhe hope to reach his goal. He gave his steed its head, and encouraged\r\nit by calling to it. The animal did not disappoint the hopes placed\r\nupon it. It seemed to fly, rather than run over the trampled ground. The\r\nCossacks, who attempted to intercept this single horseman, were unable\r\nto reach him. And of all the shots aimed at the bold rider not one\r\nreached its mark.\r\n\r\nThe volunteer orderly reached the brigade without harm. But he was too\r\nlate; almost at the same moment the collision with the Russian infantry,\r\nwhich, in spite of their losses, had advanced steadily to the attack,\r\ntook place. In order to sell his life and those of his brave troops as\r\ndearly as possible, Colonel Baird had given orders to form a square, in\r\nthe midst of which the horsemen and the guns were placed. Many officers,\r\nleaving the saddle, had picked up the rifles and cartridge-boxes of\r\nthose that were killed, and, levelling their bayonets, had taken their\r\nplaces in the front rank of the square. Breathing heavily, and covered\r\nwith perspiration Heideck stopped before the Colonel and made his\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nBut the brave Englishman pointed with his hand towards the Russians.\r\n\r\n“Impossible,” he said. “We are destined to die upon this spot.”\r\n\r\nThen he also dismounted and seized a rifle. From a thousand British\r\nthroats a loud “Hurrah!” broke forth, for the Russians had reached the\r\nsquare, and a hand-to-hand combat took place.\r\n\r\nThe horror of this terrible struggle at close quarters, the English\r\nfighting with the struggle of despair against a foe outnumbering them\r\nmany times, impressed itself indelibly upon the memory of the young\r\nGerman. He, too, had drawn his sword, but in spite of his personal\r\nrelations, his political sympathies were not on the English side.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard, close to him, a hoarse cry of rage, and, on turning\r\nround, perceived to his boundless surprise the face of Captain Irwin,\r\nterribly distorted by hatred and fury. He had supposed him to be with\r\nthe depot in Chanidigot, but Irwin must have found an opportunity\r\nof getting away from that command. Indeed, under the existing\r\ncircumstances, it must have seemed equivalent to a severe censure, and\r\nIrwin had attached himself to the troops taking the field. He was now\r\nfighting in this death-struggle, rifle in hand, like a private soldier.\r\nThe red blood staining the point of his bayonet bore eloquent testimony\r\nto his bravery. But in this supreme moment his country’s enemies were\r\nforgotten in the sight of the mortal foe, the object of his personal\r\nhate, by whose courageous action the dastardly plot against Edith had\r\nbeen frustrated. Here were place and opportunity offered for satisfying\r\nthe thirst for revenge, which consumed him. What mattered the death of a\r\nsingle unit in the midst of this great holocaust?\r\n\r\nBefore Heideck could divine the intention of the wretched man he was\r\nattacked by his bayonet. It was solely the rearing of a frightened horse\r\nthat saved the Captain’s life; the thrust of the bayonet grazed the\r\nanimal’s neck. At the same moment the terrible sword-cut of a Russian\r\nfell upon Irwin’s unprotected neck (for he had lost his helmet), and\r\nwith such force that, with a hollow cry, he fell on his face.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the curiously altered, now hoarse voice of the Colonel struck\r\nHeideck’s ear: “What are you still doing here? Ride, for Heaven’s sake!\r\nRide quickly! If you should see them again, take my last loving messages\r\nto my poor wife and children! Stay by them!”\r\n\r\nThe blood from a deep wound on his forehead was pouring over his face,\r\nand Heideck saw that only by the greatest exertion of will could he keep\r\nhimself on his legs. He wanted to reply, but the Colonel had already\r\nagain hurled himself into the tangled throng of fighters, and a few\r\nseconds later fell under the butt-end blows and sabres of the Russians.\r\n\r\nThen Hermann Heideck turned his horse and galloped off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nIN THE PANIC-STRICKEN CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs on his ride to Colonel Baird’s brigade, so also was Heideck on his\r\nreturn threatened by manifold forms of death. Although he successfully\r\nand happily avoided all compact bodies of troops on his way across the\r\nbloody battlefield, yet single Russian horsemen came up close to him and\r\nmore than once he heard the shrill whistle of bullets as they whizzed\r\npast his head. But in the battle-fever that had seized him he had\r\nno thought of danger: all his thoughts were solely occupied with the\r\nquestion as to how he should contrive to arrive at Lahore, in order to\r\nfulfil the last request of the Colonel.\r\n\r\nBleeding from several wounds, his brave stallion put forth his utmost\r\nefforts to carry his rider safely away from the turmoil of battle. The\r\nwounded animal was still able to travel a considerable distance at full\r\ngallop. But suddenly he began to slacken his pace and to stumble, and\r\nHeideck perceived that his strength was exhausted. He dismounted in\r\norder to examine the injuries the horse had sustained, and at once\r\nperceived that he could not expect further exertion from the poor brute.\r\nIn addition to a bayonet-thrust on the neck, it had also a bullet-hole\r\non the left hind flank, and it was from this wound that the blood was\r\nprincipally streaming. In stertorous panting the poor beast laid his\r\nhead on his master’s shoulder, and Heideck stroked and patted his\r\nforehead. “Poor chap--you have done your duty, and I must leave you here\r\nbehind.” And now, for the first time, the anxious dread overcame him\r\nthat he, too, would not escape with his life from this battlefield,\r\nfor he perceived a horseman in Indian uniform approaching him, waving\r\na sword. Heideck drew his revolver from his belt in order to protect\r\nhimself against his assailant. But he immediately recognised in his\r\nsupposed enemy his faithful boy, Morar Gopal, who beamed with joy at\r\nhaving by chance again found his master, whom he had believed to be\r\ndead. He wanted at once to leave Heideck his horse, and to attempt to\r\nmake his own way on foot. But the German officer would not accept this\r\nunselfish sacrifice on the part of his servant; but he was relieved\r\nof the necessity of again separating from his faithful henchman by the\r\nfortuitous circumstance that, at that very moment, an English officer’s\r\nriderless charger came in sight. The animal, a beautiful chestnut, was\r\nuninjured, and allowed itself to be caught without trouble. They\r\nwere now in a position to continue their flight together, and Heideck\r\nresolved to turn towards the left English wing, because, as it appeared\r\nto him, the action was there proceeding with less ill-fortune than at\r\nother parts of the now totally defeated British army. This was certainly\r\nnot the shortest way to reach Lahore, but it would have been a foolhardy\r\nenterprise to join the wild throng of fleeing troops and their pursuers\r\nwhich was already pouring along the road towards Lahore.\r\n\r\nThe far-stretching plantations of Shah Dara, lying on both banks of the\r\nRavi, with the bridge of boats connecting them, were, as a matter of\r\nfact, still occupied by English troops, who had until now maintained\r\ntheir positions without any severe loss; but they had been, of course,\r\nin superior numbers to the Russians confronting them. For the attack\r\nupon Shah Dara, with which the battle had opened, had in the main been\r\nonly a feint; its object being to force the English centre, against\r\nwhich the main attack was to be directed, to send out reinforcements,\r\nand thereby fatally to weaken itself. Heideck had seen with his own eyes\r\nhow completely this plan had succeeded. Now, however, when the victory\r\nthey had gained made their forces in other positions available for the\r\nwork, the Russians commenced to attack this position also in superior\r\nnumbers. Russian battalions from the reserves were being hurried up at\r\nthe double, and new batteries made their appearance, ready to open fire\r\nupon Shah Dara and the mausoleum of Shah Jahangir, which lay to the\r\nsouth of it.\r\n\r\nThe English on their side were prudent enough not to engage in a\r\nhopeless battle of sheer desperation, but began their retreat, whilst\r\nthey had still time to carry it out in tolerable order.\r\n\r\nWhen Heideck had reached the southern end of the plantations, a regiment\r\nof Bengal cavalry was just crossing the pontoon bridge, and Heideck\r\njoined it. A Russian shell, which burst right in the middle of the\r\ntroop, without, however, despite the severe losses it had caused,\r\ninterrupting the formation, was a clear proof that the situation was\r\nhere also quite untenable.\r\n\r\nWith comparatively few losses and without having once been drawn into an\r\nengagement, the regiment drew up close under the citadel, which, in the\r\nnorth of Lahore, lies inside the outer works.\r\n\r\nBut, with dismay, the hapless lancers perceived that the murderous\r\nshot and shell were pursuing them even here. Yet the bullets were\r\nnot intended for them, but for the treacherous Indian troops and the\r\nirregular Russian cavalry, which surged up, in wild panic, against the\r\nwalls. The effect of the fire was, however, none the less disastrous on\r\nthat account. The English garrison which had remained in the city had\r\nclosed all the gates, and appeared to have made up their minds to let no\r\none in, either friend or foe. All the same, the commander of the Bengal\r\nregiment drew his men together and with irresistible weight forced\r\nhis way right through the confused, huddling mass of men engaged in\r\nhand-to-hand combat beneath the walls. He made straight for one of\r\nthe gates, and those within happily understood and anticipated his\r\nintentions. Confident that the weighty blows and thrusts of the cavalry\r\nwould beat off the enemy and prevent them from forcing their way in with\r\nthem, the garrison opened the gate at the critical moment, and, together\r\nwith his regiment, Heideck and his faithful companion managed to enter\r\nthe city. The lancers made their way into the citadel, and Heideck and\r\nMorar Gopal, who had followed him like his shadow, turned their steps\r\ntowards the Charing Cross Hotel. It was, however, far from easy to get\r\nthere; for the streets were packed with an impenetrable mob of howling\r\nand gesticulating natives, who were manifestly in the greatest state of\r\nexcitement. The news that the English had lost the battle had long since\r\nreached the city, and the apprehensions which had long been entertained\r\nthat such tidings could not fail to have a disastrously disquieting\r\neffect upon the Indian population, were only too soon seen to be\r\njustified. In all the brown faces which he saw directed towards him\r\nHeideck clearly read detestation and menace. They naturally regarded him\r\nas an Englishman, and it was only his decided manner and the naked sword\r\nin his hand that prevented the rabble from venting in a personal attack\r\ntheir rage against one of the hated race of their oppressors.\r\n\r\nThe door of the hotel was closed, probably because an attack was feared\r\non the part of the natives; but as soon as a white man, who was at once\r\nregarded as an English officer, demanded admittance, it was opened.\r\nHeideck found most of the officers’ wives and children, who were living\r\nin the hotel, assembled in the hall and the dining-room which led from\r\nit. The foreboding of a terrible disaster and the fear of coming events,\r\nwhich was perpetually increased by the noise in the streets, did not\r\nallow the poor creatures to rest longer in their rooms. Mrs. Baird and\r\nEdith Irwin were not, however, among those who thronged round Heideck\r\nand, in a hundred confused questions, hoped to obtain from the\r\ndust-begrimed man, who had evidently come from the battlefield, news as\r\nto how matters stood. Heideck said nothing more than that the army\r\nwas retreating, bravely fighting the while. It would have been useless\r\ncruelty to increase the terror and despair of these unhappy creatures\r\nby a detailed account of the whole truth. He had almost to tear himself\r\naway by force from this close knot of inquirers, in order to go up\r\nto Mrs. Baird’s room. It was the first joyous feeling that he had\r\nexperienced throughout this disastrous day, when in the friendly “Come\r\nin,” in answer to his knock, he recognised Edith Irwin’s voice. The\r\nfear that something might have happened to her during his absence had\r\nunceasingly tortured him during the last few hours, and for a moment he\r\nforgot all the terrors that surrounded her in the rapture which, as he\r\nentered, her incomparable beauty awoke in him.\r\n\r\nShe had risen from the sofa in the middle of the room and stood with\r\na serious, but perfectly composed face, and with bright eyes, which\r\nappeared prepared for even the extremest danger. Mrs. Baird was, with\r\nher two little girls, in a corner on her knees. So completely was she\r\nabsorbed in her religious devotions that she had not heard Heideck’s\r\nentrance into the room. It was only when Edith exclaimed, “Here is Mr.\r\nHeideck, dear friend; I knew he would come,” that she sprang up in great\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n“Thank God! You have come from my husband? How have you left him? Is he\r\nalive?”\r\n\r\n“I left the Colonel, as he was defending himself at the head of his\r\nbrave troops against the enemy. He bade me give you his love.” He had\r\nendeavoured to give a firm tone to his voice. But the sharp feminine\r\ninstinct of the unhappy woman guessed what was behind his words,\r\nintended to give comfort.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you tell me the truth? My husband is dead!”\r\n\r\n“He was wounded, but you need not give up the hope of seeing him again\r\nalive.”\r\n\r\n“If he is wounded, I will go to him. You will conduct me, Mr. Heideck!\r\nThere must be a possibility of getting to him.”\r\n\r\n“I earnestly beseech you, my dear Mrs. Baird, to compose yourself. It\r\nis quite natural that your heart should draw you to your husband’s side;\r\nbut it is quite impossible for you to carry out your intention. The\r\nnight is drawing on, and even if it were broad daylight nobody would\r\nbe able to get through the confusion of the retiring army to the place\r\nwhere your husband must be sought.”\r\n\r\n“The battle is then lost? Our army is in full retreat?”\r\n\r\n“The treachery of the Indian troops is to blame for this disaster. Your\r\ncountrymen, Mrs. Baird, have fought like heroes, and as a lost battle\r\ndoes not yet mean a lost campaign, they will perhaps soon retrieve\r\nto-day’s disaster.”\r\n\r\n“But what is to become of us? The wounded will be brought in here, won’t\r\nthey? Therefore I shall not think of leaving before I see my husband\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nHer determination to remain in the panic-stricken city would certainly\r\nhave been impossible to shake by any art of persuasion, but Heideck did\r\nnot dream of attempting to dissuade Mrs. Baird from her resolve. It was\r\nhis firm conviction that the flight to Amritsar, which the Colonel had\r\nadvised in case of a defeat, was, under the present circumstances, quite\r\nimpracticable. As a matter of fact, there was scarcely anything else\r\npossible but to remain in the hotel and patiently await the development\r\nof events.\r\n\r\nIt was now quite impossible for white women and children to trust\r\nthemselves in the streets in the midst of the excited populace; but\r\nHeideck believed that they were, for the present, quite safe in the\r\nhouse, thinking that the fanaticism of the natives would not culminate\r\nin an attack upon the hotel so long as any considerable body of English\r\nsoldiers remained in the town. But only too soon he was compelled to\r\nadmit that he had under-estimated the seriousness of the situation. A\r\nruddy, flickering flame, which suddenly lit up the room which had been\r\nfilled by the dying evening glow, caused him to rush to the window,\r\nwhen, to his horror, he perceived that one of the houses on the opposite\r\nside of the street was on fire, and that in the adjacent building the\r\ntongues of flame had caught the wooden pillars of the verandah. There\r\nwas no doubt but that the hotel would, within a few minutes, be involved\r\nin the conflagration.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it was impossible to think of remaining longer\r\nin the hotel. Its massive walls could, perhaps, withstand the fire for a\r\ntime, but the biting volumes of smoke, which had already taken Heideck’s\r\nbreath away when he had opened the window for a moment, would soon\r\nrender it impossible for human beings to stay longer in the heat. All\r\nat once came a heavy knocking at the door, and Morar Gopal, who had been\r\nlooking for Heideck everywhere in the hotel, entreated his master to\r\nmake his escape as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe German officer was fully convinced that he had now to exchange one\r\ndanger for a peril perhaps even greater. But there was no time for delay\r\nor consideration.\r\n\r\n“We are in the midst of a fire, Mrs. Baird,” he said. “No one in the\r\ngeneral confusion will attempt to stay the raging element, and if you do\r\nnot wish to be stifled with your children, you must follow me. I hope to\r\nbe able to bring you, without harm, into the citadel or into some other\r\nplace of safety.”\r\n\r\nEdith Irwin had already taken one of the little girls into her arms; and\r\nwhen the Colonel’s wife was looking about her with a wild expression,\r\nas if she wished to try and save some of her precious valuables, Edith\r\nemphatically insisted upon her hurrying. “There is nothing more precious\r\nthan the life of your children. Let everything go, in God’s name!”\r\n\r\nThe poor woman, whose senses now began to fail her in the terrors of the\r\nmoment, quietly obeyed the calm instructions of her young friend. The\r\nother residents in the hotel had almost all already fled; only a few\r\nunhappy women, who had completely lost their heads, wandered about the\r\nlower rooms holding all manner of valueless objects, from which they\r\nwould not part, in their hands. Heideck called to them to follow him.\r\nBut they hardly understood him, and he had no more time to trouble about\r\nthe unfortunate creatures.\r\n\r\nWith a bare sabre in his hand the faithful Hindu endeavoured to make for\r\nhis master and those under his protection a path through the crowd which\r\nwas surging around the burning houses. It was now quite dark, and only\r\nthe red flames weirdly lit up the hideous nocturnal scene. The raging\r\nfanaticism of the crowd appeared during the last half-hour to have\r\nincreased in vehemence. These men, at other times so modest, submissive,\r\nand amiable, had suddenly become metamorphosed into a horde of\r\nbarbarians. Bare sabres and daggers flashed their menaces on every side,\r\nand the air was rent by a deafening din. Never before had Heideck seen\r\nhuman beings in such a state of frenzy. With wild gesticulations these\r\ndark-skinned fellows were tossing their arms and legs; they gnashed\r\ntheir teeth like wild beasts, and inflicted wounds on their own breasts\r\nand limbs in order to intensify their lust of blood by the sight of it.\r\n\r\nThe two men, by dint of peremptory commands and vigorous blows with the\r\nnaked sword, forced their way step by step through the crowd. But after\r\na lapse of ten minutes they had scarcely progressed more than a\r\nhundred yards. The surging mob around them became even denser and more\r\nthreatening in its attitude, and Heideck saw it would be impossible to\r\nreach the citadel.\r\n\r\nWith anxious care for the precious human lives entrusted to his\r\nprotection, he looked about for another place of safety. But the\r\nEuropeans had firmly barricaded their houses, and none of them would\r\nhave opened to admit the poor fugitives. On a sudden the wild cries\r\nthat had almost terrified the crying children to death rose to appalling\r\nshrieks and ravings, and a mob of demons, incited by their fanatic\r\npassions almost to frenzy, rushed from a side street straight upon\r\nHeideck. They had somewhere on their way been joined by a large number\r\nof other female fugitives; and the sight of these unhappy creatures made\r\nthe German officer’s blood run cold in his veins.\r\n\r\nThe women, among whom were two girls yet on the borders of childhood,\r\nhad had their clothes torn from their bodies, and they were now being\r\nhustled along under such constant ill-usage that they were bleeding from\r\nnumerous wounds.\r\n\r\nUnable further to curb the wrath that rose within him at the sight of\r\nthis brutality, Heideck took his revolver from his belt, and with a\r\nwell-aimed shot sent one of the howling, fanatic devils to the ground.\r\n\r\nBut his action was not well-advised. Although his martial appearance had\r\nup till then kept this cowardly crew away from acts of violence against\r\nhimself and his party, the furious rage of the mob now knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nIn the next moment the small party found itself hemmed in by a knot of\r\nraging black devils, and Heideck was no longer in doubt that it was only\r\na question of bravely fighting to the death. The foremost of the more\r\nviolent of their assailants he was able to keep off by firing at them\r\nthe last five shots that remained in his revolver. The last shot snuffed\r\nout the light of a black-bearded fellow just at the very moment when he\r\nwas attacking Edith Irwin with his brutal fists. Then Heideck threw his\r\nrevolver, useless in that he could not load it afresh, into the face\r\nof one of the grinning fiends, and clasping his left arm, which was\r\nnow free, round Edith, and pressing her tightly to him, carried on a\r\ndesperate struggle with his sword.\r\n\r\nFor Mrs. Baird and her children he could do nothing further. Now that\r\nhe had seen his faithful Morar Gopal fall under the blows of some\r\nMohammedans he felt that they were irretrievably lost. He had seen how\r\nthe Colonel’s wife had had her clothes torn in shreds from her body; he\r\nheard the heartrending cry of anguish with which, under the blows and\r\nthrusts of her inhuman torturers, she called for her children. But at\r\nall events he was spared the agony of seeing with his own eyes the end\r\nof the innocent little girls. They disappeared from his view in the\r\nterrible confusion, and as they were besides already half dead from\r\nterror, Providence would, at all events, have the pity not to let\r\nthem feel the tortures of the death which their unfeeling butchers had\r\nprepared for them.\r\n\r\nAnd what of Edith?\r\n\r\nShe was not in a faint. In her features one could read nothing of the\r\nanguish of horror that overcomes even the bravest in the face of death.\r\nOne might imagine that all that was going on around her had lost its\r\nterrors since Heideck’s arm held her fast.\r\n\r\nBut the moment was not favourable for allowing Heideck to feel the\r\npleasurable bliss of her love. His strength was at an end and, although\r\nwith the exception of a slight injury on the shoulder he was unwounded,\r\nhe yet felt it intolerably hard to wield the sword whose heavy blows had\r\nhitherto kept their assailants (with the exception of some adventuresome\r\nspirits, who had paid dearly for their impudence) at a respectful\r\ndistance. At the very moment that fatigue compelled him to drop his\r\nweapon, Edith and he would be given over helpless to the devilish\r\ncruelty of this horde of human beasts. That he knew full well, and,\r\ntherefore, although before his eyes there floated, as it were, a\r\nblood-red mist, he collected the last remnant of his strength to\r\npostpone this terrible moment yet for a little--All of a sudden\r\nsomething unexpected, something wonderful, happened--something that in\r\nhis present condition he could not understand at all; innumerable cries\r\nof terror and alarm mingled with the frenzied, triumphant howlings of\r\nthe rage-intoxicated Indians. With the irresistible force of a wave the\r\nwhole thickly packed swarm of human beings surged forwards and against\r\nthe houses on both sides of the street. The trotting of horses, loud\r\nwords of command, the sound of slashing blows were heard, and the bodies\r\nof bearded cavalrymen were visible above the heads of the crowd.\r\n\r\nIt was a squadron of Cossacks which was mercilessly hewing its way\r\nthrough the crowd. The town was then actually in the hands of the\r\nRussians, and orders had evidently been given, the better to prevent\r\nfurther massacre and incendiarism, to clear the street of the fanatic\r\nmob.\r\n\r\nSo the fierce-looking horsemen then swept the way before them clear\r\nof all obstacles. And they did their business well; for nothing could\r\nwithstand the blows from the whips fitted at the end of the lash with\r\nthin hard sticks, which in their hands became terrible instruments of\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nHeideck suddenly saw himself free of his assailants, and as he with\r\nEdith pressed against the wall of a house, they remained happily safe\r\nfrom the horses’ hoofs as well as from the blows of the knout which were\r\nbeing dealt out wildly around him.\r\n\r\nBut the keen eyes of a Cossack officer had perceived the little group\r\namid the great heap of dead and wounded. He rode up to them, and as he\r\nthought he recognised in Heideck’s khaki dress the English uniform, he\r\ngave certain orders to his men, the meaning of which was soon apparent\r\nto them both, for they were at once placed between the horses of two\r\nCossacks, and without knowing whither they were being taken, passed\r\nthrough the streets lit up by the flames of the burning houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE COURT-MARTIAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mausoleum of Anar Kali, a great octagonal building in the gardens to\r\nthe south of the town, was the place whither the Russian prisoners\r\nwere taken. Heideck and Edith Irwin were not the first that had found\r\nquarters there; for, besides about a hundred officers, there were\r\nalready there numberless English ladies and children whose saviours had\r\nappeared in time to rescue them from the horrible fate of Mrs. Baird and\r\nher children. At the open door of the apartments reserved for the women\r\nHeideck and Edith Irwin had to part. They were not allowed a long time\r\nto take leave. But even if they had been altogether alone they would at\r\nthis moment have been scarcely able to find much to say; for after all\r\nthe exertions and excitements of the terrible day just ended such\r\nheavy fatigue and exhaustion had overcome them that they could only\r\nmechanically make use of their limbs; and so, instead of the passions,\r\nhopes, and fears, with which they had been moved but a short time\r\npreviously, there was now only a dull void in their brains as in their\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n“Au revoir, to-morrow.” That was all that passed between them. Then, as\r\nsoon as they had conducted him into the room assigned to him, Heideck\r\nthrew himself down, as he was, upon the tiles of the floor, and fell\r\ninstantaneously into a deep, dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\nThe glorious Indian sun, which shone through the round opening in the\r\nceiling down upon his face, woke him the next morning.\r\n\r\nHis limbs were stiff from his uncomfortable couch, but the short sleep\r\nhad invigorated him, and his nerves had completely regained their old\r\nfreshness and vigour.\r\n\r\nHis room-mates must have been taken away early to some other place, for\r\nhe found himself quite alone in the lofty room which was only lighted by\r\nthe window in the ceiling. The rays of the sun fell opposite to him\r\nupon a tomb of the purest, whitest, marble quite covered with illegible\r\nhieroglyphics. Whilst he was still engaged in looking at the apparently\r\nancient memorial tablet, he heard suddenly behind him the light rustling\r\nof a woman’s dress, and when he turned round he gazed with pleasurable\r\nsurprise into Edith Irwin’s pale, fair face.\r\n\r\n“How delighted I am to find you still here,” she said with a happy\r\nexpression. “I was afraid that you had been taken away with the other\r\nprisoners.”\r\n\r\n“As it seems, it was out of consideration for my well-deserved slumber,”\r\n he replied, with a slight trace of humour. But then, remembering the\r\nterrible seriousness of the situation, he continued in altered and\r\nhearty tones--\r\n\r\n“How have you passed the night, Mrs. Irwin? It appears to me as if\r\nall that I have gone through since my return to Lahore has only been a\r\ndream.”\r\n\r\nWith a painful quiver of the lips she shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately, there is no room for doubt that it has been hideous\r\nreality. Poor, poor Mrs. Baird! One must almost consider it a happy\r\ndispensation of Providence that her husband did not live to see the\r\nterrible fate of his family.”\r\n\r\n“What, have you news from the field of battle? Do you then know that the\r\nColonel is dead?”\r\n\r\nEdith nodded.\r\n\r\n“The Colonel is dead; my husband is dead; Captain McGregor, and many of\r\nmy friends from Chanidigot, have been left on the field.”\r\n\r\nShe said it calmly; but he read in her eyes the deep sadness of her\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nMuch affected by her heroic strength of character, he bent his head\r\nand kissed her hand. She let him have his way for a moment, but then\r\nwithdrew her thin, cool fingers with a beseeching look, the meaning of\r\nwhich he full well understood.\r\n\r\n“The Commander-in-Chief and his staff reached the railway station,”\r\n she continued; “they travelled to Delhi with the last train that left\r\nLahore, just at the eleventh hour; for immediately afterwards the\r\nRussians entered the town. The wreck of the army is now marching to\r\nDelhi, but their pursuers are close at their heels. God alone knows what\r\nwill be the fate of our poor defeated army.”\r\n\r\nHe did not ask her where she had obtained all this information; but\r\nthat it was quite correct he was firmly convinced, judging by his own\r\nexperience. He did not know what to say to her to encourage her, he\r\nwho never had been able to toy with empty phrases. A short while they\r\nremained silent, and their eyes simultaneously fell upon the sunlit\r\nmarble tomb before them.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen this cenotaph before?” the young lady suddenly asked, to\r\nHeideck’s surprise. On his answering in the negative, she went on--\r\n\r\n“This is the famous tomb of Anar Kali, the beloved wife of Sultan\r\nAkbar, who, on account of her beauty, was given the name of ‘Pomegranate\r\nBlossom.’ She probably departed this life in the same way that we should\r\nhave done if the daggers of the murderers yesterday had reached us. She,\r\nperhaps, was just as little conscious of what was happening to her, as\r\nwe should have been in this past night.”\r\n\r\n“Can you read the inscription?” asked Heideck.\r\n\r\n“No, but I have had it interpreted to me; for it is one of the most\r\nfamous inscriptions in India. The beautiful Anar Kali was once so\r\nfoolish as to smile when the son of her lord and master entered the\r\nharem. And in the selfsame hour the jealous sultan had the unhappy woman\r\nexecuted. But he must have loved her very dearly, for he erected to\r\nher this beautiful memorial, which should hand down to generations yet\r\nunborn the name of Anar Kali. So full of insoluble riddles is the poor,\r\nfoolish heart of man.”\r\n\r\nJingling footsteps were heard on the flagstones outside, and the next\r\nmoment an officer appeared at the door accompanied by several soldiers.\r\nIn abrupt, peremptory tones he ordered Heideck to follow him.\r\n\r\nNow, for the first time, the Captain saw in Edith Irwin’s face something\r\nlike an expression of terror.\r\n\r\n“What is the meaning of this?” She turned hastily to the Russian. “This\r\ngentleman is not an Englishman.”\r\n\r\nThe Russian did not understand the question in English; but when Heideck\r\nasked in Russian what they were about to do with him, he replied,\r\nshrugging his shoulders--\r\n\r\n“I do not know. Follow me.”\r\n\r\n“They only want me to prove my identity,” said Heideck composedly, in\r\norder to calm the young lady. “I hope that they will let me free after\r\nexamining my passports.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly they must let you go!” she cried, almost passionately. “It\r\nwould be against all the laws of nations if they were to do you any\r\nharm. But how shall I endure the uncertainty as to your fate?”\r\n\r\n“I shall come back here at once, as soon as it is possible for me to do\r\nso.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes! I beseech you, do not leave me a second longer than you are\r\nobliged. I have not as yet had time to thank you.”\r\n\r\nThe Russian officer showed such manifest signs of impatience that\r\nHeideck no longer hesitated to follow him.\r\n\r\nThe way that he had to go was not long. He was taken to a house close\r\nby, over whose gate the words “School of Arts” were sculptured in the\r\nstone. He had only to wait a short while in the hall, when before\r\nhim there opened the door of a room on the ground floor, adorned with\r\nsculptures, in which a number of officers sat at a long table.\r\nTo Heideck it was at once clear that he was to be tried before a\r\ncourt-martial. A few very downcast-looking men had just been led out.\r\nThe officer who presided turned over the papers which lay before him,\r\nand then, casting a sharp look at Heideck, spoke a few words with his\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he asked in English, with a decided Russian accent, which\r\nwas difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nHeideck, who also spoke in English, answered shortly and clearly, and\r\nlaid his passport, which he always carried in the breast-pocket of his\r\ncoat as his most valuable possession in ease of emergency, before the\r\nColonel.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had read it, the President said in perfect German--\r\n\r\n“You are, then, no Englishman, but a German? What are you doing here in\r\nIndia?”\r\n\r\n“I am travelling for the firm of Heideck, in Hamburg.”\r\n\r\n“In business? Really? Is it part of your business to fight against\r\nRussia?”\r\n\r\n“No! and I have not done so.”\r\n\r\n“You deny, then, that you took part in yesterday’s battle?”\r\n\r\n“As a combatant, yes! There were other reasons which led me to the\r\nbattlefield.”\r\n\r\n“You only went as a spectator? Didn’t it occur to you that, under the\r\ncircumstances, this might be very dangerous for you?”\r\n\r\n“I have personal relations with several gentlemen in the English army,\r\nand these relations made it necessary for me to visit them during the\r\nbattle.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel turned to a young officer standing a little distance away--\r\n\r\n“Lieutenant Osarov, is it true that you recognised in this man, when\r\nhe was brought in here last night, a person whom you saw in an English\r\nsquare during the progress of the battle?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Colonel, I did!” was the decided reply. “I recognise him now quite\r\nclearly. He was riding a black horse, and dashed off when we broke into\r\nthe square.”\r\n\r\nHeideck perceived that it would be useless to deny the fact, in the face\r\nof this direct evidence, and his military honour would, in any case, not\r\nhave permitted him to do so.\r\n\r\n“What the lieutenant has said is quite correct,” he answered,\r\nanticipating the Colonel’s question; “but I did not take part in the\r\nfighting. As a friend of Colonel Baird, who was killed, I kept as long\r\nas possible close to him, so as to be able to bring his relations, who\r\nwere left behind in Lahore, tidings of his fate and of the issue of the\r\nbattle.”\r\n\r\n“You, a foreigner, were armed in the English square. Since you confess\r\nthis much, we need not trouble ourselves with further proceedings. You,\r\ngentlemen, will all agree that we should treat him, according to martial\r\nlaw, as a traitor?”\r\n\r\nThe last words were addressed to the other judges, and, with a silent\r\nbow, they declared their assent.\r\n\r\n“Since you, a citizen of a nation not at war with us, have fought in the\r\nranks of our enemies, the Court must therefore sentence you to death.\r\nThe judgment of the Court will be at once carried into effect. Have you\r\nanything to say?”\r\n\r\nHeideck was as though stunned. It appeared to him as though a black veil\r\nwas drawn across the world; and a sharp pang of grief shot through him\r\nas he reflected that he would never see Edith again, and that she would\r\nin vain wait for him for ever.\r\n\r\nThen his pride was roused. No one should call him cowardly or timid.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible to appeal against the judgment of this court-martial?”\r\n he asked, looking firmly at the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“Then I must, of course, submit to your sentence, but I protest both\r\nagainst the procedure of the Court and against the judgment you have\r\npronounced.”\r\n\r\nHis protest evidently did not make the slightest impression.\r\n\r\n“Have you drawn up the execution warrant?” the Colonel said, turning to\r\nthe secretary. He then appended his signature and handed it to one of\r\nthe attendant Cossacks.\r\n\r\n“Lead the prisoner away.”\r\n\r\nTwo of the soldiers took Heideck between them, and he followed them with\r\na proud, erect bearing, without saying a word more. Amidst the rain of\r\nbullets on the battlefield he had not felt the least trace of fear; but\r\nthe thought of being led like an animal to the slaughter-house, filled\r\nhim with horror. All the same a power he had hitherto not discovered,\r\nsustained him. The new danger awoke in him new vigour of soul and\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks conducted him a long way on the road which leads from Anar\r\nKali to the Meean Meer cantonment. Heideck looked about him and observed\r\nthe changes that had taken place in Lahore, just like a traveller who\r\nalready in spirit lives in the new world that he intends to visit and\r\nwho looks upon familiar objects as something strange. Everywhere he\r\nsaw small detachments of cavalry, who were preserving order. Only faint\r\nclouds of smoke still marked the place of the fire in the city, which\r\nhad evidently been extinguished. The splendid gardens of Donald Town,\r\nthrough which their way led, the agricultural plantations, and Lawrence\r\nPark wore the same aspect as in the time of profoundest peace.\r\n\r\nHeideck was not chained, but the Cossacks who walked beside him had\r\ntheir carbines presented, ready to fire should he attempt to escape. But\r\nhow could he escape? Everywhere round and about, outposts of the Russian\r\ncavalry were discernible; behind him a body of Cossack horse escorted a\r\nwhole troop of Indians. Probably they were incendiaries and robbers who\r\nwere, like him, being led out for execution; and it did not improve his\r\nframe of mind to find himself on his last road in the company of such a\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\nAfter a long march they at length reached the encampment which had been\r\noccupied by the English, the barracks and tents of which were now filled\r\nwith Russian troops. It was only with difficulty that his escort could\r\nmake their way through the crowd that had assembled; the report that a\r\nnumber of criminals were being brought into camp must have arrived here\r\nbefore them, for soldiers of all arms pressed forward inquisitively from\r\nall sides, in order to have a close view of the poor wretches.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Heideck felt the clutch of a small but firm hand upon his arm.\r\n\r\n“Oh, master, what is this? Why are they bringing you here like a\r\nprisoner?”\r\n\r\nAt the first word Heideck recognised the soft voice, that in the\r\nexcitement had assumed its natural feminine tones. In the same fantastic\r\npage’s livery in which he had last seen him in Chanidigot, the pretended\r\nservant of his friend Prince Tchajawadse here stood quite unexpectedly\r\nbefore him, as though he had suddenly sprung from the earth, while the\r\nmost pained consternation showed itself in his fair, expressive face.\r\n\r\n“Is it you, Georgi?” exclaimed Heideck, into whose sadness of heart\r\nthe sight of the Circassian brought a faint gleam of hope; “and your\r\nmaster--the Prince? Is he also close at hand?”\r\n\r\nBut the Cossacks did not seem inclined to permit their prisoner any\r\nfurther private conversation.\r\n\r\n“Be off with you, young fellow!” one of them exclaimed to the supposed\r\npage; “this is a spy, who is to be shot on the spot; and no one is\r\nallowed to speak to him.”\r\n\r\nHe made a movement as though with a slight motion of his powerful fist\r\nto thrust the slender lithe figure aside, when Georgi fearlessly pushed\r\nback his arm and glared at him with flashing eyes.\r\n\r\n“Hold your blasphemous tongue, you liar! You are a thousand times more\r\nof a spy than this gentleman. If you do not leave go of him at once,\r\nyou will have a knouting that you will not forget until the end of your\r\nlife!”\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks looked at him and laughed. It was only the handsome face\r\nand the aristocratic bearing of the bold young fellow that prevented\r\ntheir seizing him.\r\n\r\n“Take care, little fellow, that you do not first get the stick,” one of\r\nthem said good-humouredly; “and be off with you, before we, by accident,\r\ncrush you between our finger and thumb.”\r\n\r\n“Go now, Georgi,” Heideck now said, in his turn, on perceiving that the\r\nCircassian was not inclined to obey their orders; “if your master is\r\nnear by, go and tell him that I am about to be shot against all the\r\nrules of international law. But tell him to make haste, if he wants to\r\nsee me again alive; for it looks as though his comrades intend to make\r\nshort work of me.”\r\n\r\nHe did not doubt that the beautiful, hot-blooded daughter of the\r\nmountains had completely understood him. At all events he saw how she\r\nsuddenly turned like a flash of lightning, and with the lithe rapidity\r\nof a slender lizard threaded her way through the crowd of rough\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nA new hope awoke in Heideck’s breast, and he felt himself once more\r\nfettered in a thousand bonds to life, which he just before thought he\r\nhad entirely parted from. He endeavoured to walk more slowly, in order\r\nto gain time. But the Cossacks, who had until now treated him with a\r\ncertain amount of consideration, appeared to have become irritated\r\nby the scene with the page, for one of them urged the prisoner in\r\ncommanding tones to greater haste, while the other raised his fist in\r\nhis face with a menacing gesture.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he would even have struck him; but the German officer looked\r\ninto his face with such a proud, commanding glance that he let his\r\nraised arm sink to his side. The sullen-looking fellow felt at once\r\nthat he was not here dealing with an ordinary spy, and from this moment\r\nneither curses nor abuse passed his lips.\r\n\r\nThe rattle of a rifle volley struck Heideck’s ear, and although he was\r\nsufficiently accustomed to the crack of shots, a cold shiver passed over\r\nhim. The bullets that had just been fired had--he knew it well without\r\nanyone telling him--been the portion of some poor devil who had been\r\nin the same position as himself. That was why these rifle shots were\r\nso full of a significance for him, quite different from that caused\r\nyesterday by the rattle and the crash of the raging battle. Truly, one\r\nneed not be a coward to feel an icy shudder at the thought of ten or\r\ntwenty rifle barrels directed at one’s own breast.\r\n\r\nAnd now they had reached the fatal spot which was to be the goal of all\r\nhis earthly wanderings. The parade at the rear of the barrack camp\r\nhad been selected for the place of execution, and so summarily was the\r\npunishment being dealt out, that no time had been found to cart away\r\nseparately the corpses of those who had been shot. They simply left them\r\nlying in the trench before which the delinquents were posted, probably\r\nbecause burial in a common grave was more convenient.\r\n\r\nAn officer was handed the execution warrant, which had been issued by\r\nthe President of the court-martial, and handed over the prisoner to a\r\nnon-commissioned officer, who, regarding him with an expression of pity,\r\nbade him in an almost apologetic tone to follow him.\r\n\r\nOnly a few minutes after his arrival on the parade ground, Heideck also\r\nwas standing before the fatal ditch, and saw a company of infantry, with\r\ntheir arms at attention, drawn up before him.\r\n\r\nHe had now abandoned all hope. Since the verdict of the court-martial\r\nonly a miracle could have saved him; and this miracle had not happened.\r\nFor a few short minutes he had, after the accidental meeting with the\r\nCircassian, been foolish enough to entertain new hopes of life, but\r\nnow even those had vanished. Even had she been animated by the keenest\r\ndesire to save him, what, after all, could she do to make the impossible\r\npossible? He was sorry now that he had not confined himself to begging\r\nthe Prince through her to allow him decent burial and to send word to\r\nthe German General Staff. These last wishes would, perhaps, have not\r\nbeen impossible of fulfilment, and he did not doubt that his amiable\r\nRussian acquaintance would have gladly rendered him this trifling\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe word of command rang out, and the soldiers posted opposite to him\r\nhad already, with clank and rattle, shouldered arms, when from the\r\nother side a loud peremptory shout reached Heideck’s ear, and he saw a\r\nhorseman in Russian dragoon’s uniform dashing up, in whose dark red face\r\nhe immediately recognised the Prince Tchajawadse.\r\n\r\nClose before Heideck he reined in his dripping charger and sprang from\r\nthe saddle.\r\n\r\n“Little brother! little brother!” he cried, quite breathless from his\r\nride in such hot haste, clasping, with genuine Russian impetuosity, his\r\nfriend, whom he had found again under such strange circumstances, to\r\nhis breast. “By all the saints--I should think it was quite time that I\r\ncame!”\r\n\r\nThen, turning to the astonished officer commanding the firing squad--\r\n\r\n“There must be a mistake here. No harm must happen to this gentleman,\r\nfor he is not only a personal friend of my own, but he is also a\r\ncomrade, an officer of the allied German army.”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“I have to carry out my orders, Colonel! I can undertake no\r\nresponsibility for any mistakes on the part of my superior officers or\r\nof the court-martial.”\r\n\r\n“I take, then, all the responsibility on my own shoulders for preventing\r\nyou from carrying out your instructions, lieutenant! This gentleman will\r\naccompany me, and I give my guarantee for him.”\r\n\r\nHe gave his horse to one of the soldiers, linked his arm in that of\r\nHeideck, and took him off to the tent he occupied in the camp, giving\r\nthe while most exuberant expression to his delight at having seen him\r\nagain. The breakfast, from which Georgi’s message had startled him, was\r\nstill on the table, and Heideck needed not much encouragement to partake\r\nof it; for only now he properly realised how much he was in want of\r\nbodily sustenance. Prince Tchajawadse would not hear of any thanks for\r\nwhat he had done; but when Heideck asked him if he had really correctly\r\nunderstood that the Prince had spoken of an alliance between the Russian\r\nand German armies, the latter was not slow to give all information on\r\nthis head.\r\n\r\n“Yes! yes!--it is the fact! The German Empire is hand-in-hand with us.\r\nThe first piece of good news that I heard on reaching the army was that\r\nWilliam II. had declared war upon England. The world is in flames. Only\r\nAustria and Italy are neutral.”\r\n\r\n“And I had no notion of it! But, after all, that is easy enough to\r\nexplain. All the telegraph cables are in the hands of the English, and\r\nit was easy for them to suppress every unwelcome despatch. The Indian\r\nnewspapers are only allowed, of course, to publish what is agreeable to\r\nthe Government; but I am burning with curiosity to learn more. Do you\r\nperhaps know how matters have developed as yet, and in what way Germany\r\nthinks of carrying on the war?”\r\n\r\n“It appears that an invasion of England is contemplated. Germany has\r\nmobilised one half of her army, and has occupied Holland. The French\r\ntroops, on the other hand, have entered Belgium, so that the two Powers\r\ncontrol the whole coast opposite England.”\r\n\r\n“And has any action taken place at sea as yet?”\r\n\r\n“No; at least down to the present no news has reached us of a naval\r\nbattle having been fought. Things are evidently still in the stage\r\nof preparation, and nothing has been heard about the movements of the\r\nGerman and French fleets. However, the latest intelligence that I\r\nhave is now fairly old. We with the army only learn the news that the\r\nCossacks bring us.”\r\n\r\nHeideck struck his forehead.\r\n\r\n“I feel utterly astonished. To comprehend and digest at one time all\r\nthat you have told me almost passes the capacity of a single brain. But\r\npardon me, Prince, if I trouble you, who have already done so much for\r\nme to-day, with a further request. I am in great anxiety about a lady,\r\nthe widow of an English officer who fell in yesterday’s battle, and who\r\nwas committed to my care. I only left her this morning early, when I was\r\narrested to be taken before the court-martial, at the mausoleum of Anar\r\nKali, where she had been interned with other prisoners. Advise me what\r\nto do, in order to send the lady, whose welfare is nearest my heart, a\r\nreassuring message as to my fate, and at the same time shield her from\r\nannoyance and discomfort.”\r\n\r\n“That is a very simple matter. Do you object to giving me the name of\r\nthe lady?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. It is Mrs. Edith Irwin, the widow of Captain Irwin, whom\r\nyou also perhaps met in Chanidigot.”\r\n\r\n“I think I have some recollection. There was something about a gambling\r\naffair, with which he was not very creditably connected--wasn’t it so?\r\nWell, then, while you take a good sound sleep in my tent here I\r\nwill ride over to Anar Kali, visit the lady, and find out how she is\r\nsituated. Be quite sure that no unpleasantness shall happen to her, if\r\nonly I succeed in finding her.”\r\n\r\n“Your kindness puts me quite to shame, Prince. I--”\r\n\r\n“You would do precisely the same if fate had happened to have exchanged\r\nour roles. Why, then, waste words about it? I cannot, unfortunately,\r\noffer you a more comfortable couch than my camp-bed there. But you are a\r\nsoldier, and I think both of us have, before now, had a worse shakedown.\r\nSo, then, pleasant dreams, my friend! I will take care that you are not\r\ndisturbed for the next two hours.”\r\n\r\nHurriedly, as though to escape all further expressions of gratitude, the\r\nPrince left the tent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE PROFESSOR\r\n\r\n\r\nSound though Heideck’s sleep was, the confused din that penetrated\r\nthrough the sides of the tent would have recalled an unconscious person\r\nto life. Confused and drowsy as he was, he hurried out just in time to\r\nprevent a wild-looking, dark-skinned Indian from dealing a heavy blow\r\nwith a thick staff, which he held in his right hand, upon a thin,\r\nblack-garbed gentleman, who was surrounded by a whole band of natives.\r\nThe European, with his emaciated, beardless face, looked like a\r\nclergyman, and all the greater was Heideck’s surprise that none of the\r\nRussian non-commissioned officers and soldiers, who were spectators of\r\nthe assault, raised a hand to protect him. It was certainly not his duty\r\nto act in this place as one in authority, but the danger in which he\r\nperceived this perfectly defenceless man to be, made him forget all\r\npersonal considerations. With a menacing shout he drove off the excited\r\nIndians, and, taking the stranger’s arm, led him into the tent.\r\n\r\nNone of the Russian military prevented his doing so. He had been seen in\r\nconfidential conversation with the Colonel, and his position as a friend\r\nof the Prince procured him respect.\r\n\r\nThe stranger, half dead from fear, gratefully accepted the glass of\r\nwine which Heideck poured out for him, and, having recovered somewhat,\r\nthanked his protector in simple, but cordial terms. He introduced\r\nhimself as Professor Proctor, of Acheson College, and explained that\r\nhe had come to the camp to look after a relation who had probably been\r\nseriously wounded. He had on a sudden found himself threatened by a band\r\nof excited Indians, who were probably misled by his dress to take him\r\nfor a cleric.\r\n\r\n“You, also, are no Russian, sir. Judging from your accent, I should take\r\nyou for a German.”\r\n\r\nHeideck assented, and narrated his history in a few words. Having done\r\nso, he could not help expressing his amazement at the attack of which\r\nthe Professor had been the victim.\r\n\r\n“Never during my whole stay in India have I ever before observed any\r\noutburst of hatred on the part of the Indian natives against the English\r\nclergy,” he said.\r\n\r\nTo this the Professor replied: “Even a few days ago not one of them\r\nwould, I should think, have had anything to fear; but in the face of\r\nsuch terrible upheavals as are now taking place all ideas are thrown\r\ninto confusion, all slumbering passions are unfettered. I do not venture\r\nto think of the horrors that will take place throughout the whole of\r\nIndia now that the bridle that curbed the people has been rent asunder;\r\nand the worst of all is that we have only ourselves to blame.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean on account of the carelessness with which the defence of\r\nthe country was organised?”\r\n\r\n“I do not mean that alone. Our fault is that we have ignored an eternal\r\ntruth, the truth that all political questions are only the external\r\nexpression, the dress, so to say, of religious questions.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, but I do not quite follow the sense of your words.”\r\n\r\n“Please consider the slow, steady advance of the Russians in Asia.\r\nEvery land that they have brought under their sway--all the immense\r\nterritories of Central Asia have become their assured, undisputed\r\npossessions. And why? Because the Russians have known how to win over\r\nthe hearts of their subject races, and how to humour their religious\r\nviews. The victors and the vanquished thus better assimilate. The\r\nEnglish, on the other hand, have governed India purely from the\r\npolitical side. The hearts of the various races in India have remained\r\nstrange and hostile to us.”\r\n\r\n“There may be some truth in what you say. But you must allow that the\r\nEnglish have in India substituted a new civilisation in return, that\r\ninculcates a spirit of intellectual progress, and I conceive that no\r\nnation can for any length of time remain blind in the face of higher\r\nideals. All history forms a continuous chain of evidence for the truth\r\nof this statement.”\r\n\r\n“The word ‘civilisation’ has various significations. If it is only a\r\nquestion of investigating whether the government and administration\r\nof the country have improved, the answer is that the civilisation\r\nwe brought to India has, beyond all doubt, made enormous strides, in\r\ncomparison with the conditions that obtained in former centuries. We\r\nhave broken the despotism of the native princes, and have put an end to\r\nthe endless sanguinary wars which they waged with each other and\r\nwith their Asiatic neighbouring despots. We have laid down roads and\r\nrailways, drained marshes and jungles, constructed harbours, won great\r\ntracts of lands from the sea, and built protecting dams and piers. The\r\nterrible mortality of the large cities has considerably decreased. We\r\nhave given them laws assuring personal security and guaranteeing new\r\noutlets for trade and commerce. But the aspirations of our English\r\nGovernment have been purely utilitarian, and as regards the deeper-lying\r\ncurrent of development no progress is anywhere perceivable.”\r\n\r\n“And, pray, what do you exactly mean by this?”\r\n\r\n“Your views in this matter are possibly divergent. I discern in most of\r\nour achievements in India only another manifestation of that materialism\r\nwhich has ever proved the worst obstacle to all real development.”\r\n\r\n“It appears to me, Mr. Proctor,” Heideck interrupted, with a smile,\r\n“that you have become a Buddhist, owing to your sojourn in India!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so, sir, and I should not be ashamed of such a creed. Many\r\na one, who on first coming here regarded India with the eyes of a\r\nChristian, has, on nearer acquaintance, become a Buddhist. Greek wise\r\nmen once expressed the wish that kings should be chosen from among the\r\nphilosophers. That may possibly be an unrealisable hope, but I do\r\nnot believe that a ruler who has a contempt for philosophy will ever\r\nproperly fulfil the high duties of his station. A policy without\r\nphilosophy is, like an unphilosophical religion, not established on\r\nfirmer ground than those houses there on the river Ravi, whose existence\r\nis not safe for a single day, because the river at times takes it into\r\nits head to change its course. A government that does not understand\r\nhow to honour the religious feelings of its people, does not stand more\r\nsecurely than one of those huts. The fate that has now overtaken the\r\nEnglish is the best proof of what I say. We are the only power in Asia\r\nthat has not founded its political sway upon the religion of the people.\r\nIn our folly we have destroyed the habitual simplicity of a nation,\r\nwhich, until our coming, had been content with the barest necessities of\r\nlife, because for thousands of years past it cared more about the\r\nlife after death than for its earthly existence. We have incited the\r\nslumbering passions of this people, and by offering to their eyes the\r\nsight of European luxury and European over-civilisation, have aroused in\r\nthem desires to which they were formerly strangers. Our system of public\r\ninstruction is calculated to disseminate among all classes of the Indian\r\nrace the worthless materialistic popular education of our own nation. Of\r\nall the governors and inspectors of schools who have been sent hither by\r\nEngland not a single one has taken the trouble to penetrate beneath the\r\nsurface of the life of the Indian people and to fathom the soul of this\r\nreligious and transcendentally gifted race. What contrasts are not the\r\nresult! Here a holy river, priests, ascetics, yogis, fakirs, temples,\r\nshrines, mysterious doctrines, a manifold ritual; while side by side,\r\nwithout any transition, are schools wherein homely English elementary\r\ninstruction is provided, a State-supported university with a medical\r\nschool and Christian churches of the most varied confessions.”\r\n\r\n“But how would it have been possible to combine in a school modern\r\nscientific education with Indian fanaticism?”\r\n\r\nA superior smile flitted across the professor’s intellectual face.\r\n\r\n“Compare, I pray you, the tiresome trivialities of English missionary\r\ntracts with the immortal masterpieces of Indian literature! Then you\r\nwill understand that the Indian, even when he approves Christianity as a\r\nsystem of morals, demands a deeper and wider basis of these morals, and\r\ninquires as to the origin of the Christian doctrine; and then he very\r\nsoon finds that all light which has come to Europe started from Asia. Ex\r\noriente lux.”\r\n\r\n“I am not sufficiently well informed to be able to answer you on this\r\npoint. It may very well be that even Christianity was not the offspring\r\nof Judaism alone, but of Buddhism. It may also be the case that the\r\nteachings of our missionaries of to-day are too insipid for the Indians.\r\nBut the metaphysical needs of a people have, after all, little to do\r\nwith sound policy and good laws. Think of Rome! The Roman state had most\r\nexcellent laws, and a magnificent political force which for centuries\r\nkept it in its predominant position among the nations of the world. But\r\nwhat of religion and philosophy in Rome? There was no state religion\r\nwhatsoever; there was no priestly hierarchy, no strict theological\r\ncodex, but only a mythology and worship of gods, which was of an\r\neminently practical character, and it was owing to their practical\r\ncommon sense--or, as you would prefer to call it, materialism--that\r\nthe Romans were enabled to found an organised society upon purely human\r\nneeds and aspirations. And why should what they were enabled to achieve\r\nbe impossible again for other nations who have succeeded them in their\r\nworld-power? The spirit of the age is ever changing, yet it is only a\r\nregularly recurring return of the same conditions, just as the planets\r\nin the heavens, ever again in their orbit, come back to their old\r\npositions.”\r\n\r\n“And supposing the ‘Zeitgeist,’ like many planets, does not move in a\r\ncircle but in a spiral line? The British world-sovereignty has, as we\r\nsee, taken a higher flight than did the Roman. Could not this British\r\nworld-power, by permeating wise diplomacy with the profound idea of\r\nIndian philosophy, have attained to a great reformation of the whole\r\nof the human race? It would have been a glorious idea, but I have here\r\nlearnt how far they were from its realisation.”\r\n\r\n“All the same, I do not think that the English army would have been\r\ndefeated by the Russian, had they not fought in accordance with the\r\nrules of antiquated tactics.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir, if the Indian troops had fought with their whole soul for\r\nEngland we should never have sustained this defeat.”\r\n\r\n“As a soldier, I am inclined to dispute that. The Indians will never be\r\na match for a well-disciplined European army. The race is wanting in too\r\ngreat a measure in military qualities.”\r\n\r\n“The Indian people is, by nature, it is true, gentle and good-hearted.\r\nIn order to render it wild and bloodthirsty it must be wounded in its\r\nmost sacred feelings.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you judge it rather too mildly. Decided traces of barbarism\r\nstill linger in this people, even in its highest circles. Here is a case\r\nin point that I am able to quote of my own personal knowledge. An Indian\r\nprince, before the outbreak of the war, attempted to carry off, by\r\nhis servants, an English lady from her home, and bribed an assassin to\r\npoison the English resident, who rebuked him for his conduct.”\r\n\r\nThe Professor was astounded.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible? Can such things be? Have you not perhaps been deceived\r\nby an exaggerated report?”\r\n\r\n“I myself was close at hand, and observed all that took place, and can\r\ngive you, the names. The lady upon whom this dastardly attempt was made\r\nis Mrs. Edith Irwin, who had followed her husband, a captain in the\r\nlancers, to the camp of Chanidigot.”\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of the Professor visibly increased.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Edith Irwin? Is it possible? The daughter of my old friend, the\r\nexcellent Rector Graham? Yes, beyond doubt, it must be the same, because\r\nshe was married to a captain in the lancers.”\r\n\r\n“Since yesterday she is this officer’s widow. He fell in the battle of\r\nLahore, and she herself is among the prisoners interned in Anar Kali.”\r\n\r\n“Then I must endeavour to find her, for she has a claim, for her\r\nfather’s sake, upon my assistance. But, certainly, for the moment,” he\r\nobserved, with a somewhat melancholy smile, “I am myself in the greatest\r\nneed of protection.”\r\n\r\n“I believe you may be perfectly easy in your mind as to this lady. My\r\nfriend, Prince Tchajawadse, has just now ridden over to Anar Kali in\r\norder, at my request, to look after the lady.”\r\n\r\nHe had not concluded the sentence when the tall form of the Prince made\r\nits appearance at the entrance of the tent. His downcast face presaged\r\nno good news. He advanced to Heideck and shook his hand.\r\n\r\n“I am not, unfortunately, the bearer of any good news, comrade. I have\r\nnot discovered the lady whose guardian you are.”\r\n\r\n“What! Has she left? And you could not learn whither she is gone?”\r\n\r\n“All that I have been able to elicit is that she was driven off in an\r\nelegant carriage, in the company of several Indians. An English lady who\r\nsaw the occurrence told me this.”\r\n\r\nA fearful dread overcame Heideck.\r\n\r\n“In the company of Indians? And does nobody know whither she was taken?\r\nDid she leave no message for me or anyone else?”\r\n\r\n“The lady had no opportunity of speaking to her. She saw the departure\r\nat a distance.”\r\n\r\n“But she must have noticed whether Mrs. Irwin left the mausoleum of her\r\nown free will or under compulsion?”\r\n\r\nThe Prince shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“I cannot, unfortunately, say anything about that. My inquiries were\r\nwithout result. Neither any one of the English prisoners or of the\r\nRussian sentries was able to give me further information.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nDOWNING STREET\r\n\r\n\r\nA meeting of the Cabinet Council was being held at the Foreign Office\r\nin London. With gloomy faces the Ministers were all assembled. The\r\nforeboding of a catastrophe brooded over England like a black cloud;\r\nall manner of rumours of disaster were current in the land, and coming\r\nevents were awaited with sickening dread.\r\n\r\n“A telegram from the general in command,” said the Prime Minister,\r\nopening the paper he held in his hand. A deadly silence fell upon the\r\nroom:\r\n\r\n“With painful emotion, I communicate to His Majesty’s Government the\r\nnews of a great reverse I suffered the day before yesterday at Lahore.\r\nI have only to-day reached Delhi with the remnant of my army, which\r\nhas been pursued by the Russian advance guard. We had taken up a very\r\nfavourable position on the left bank of the Ravi and were on the\r\npoint of preventing the Russian army from crossing the river, when\r\nunexpectedly a violent onslaught made upon our left wing at Shah Dara\r\ncompelled us to send reinforcements to this wing and thus to weaken the\r\ncentre. Under the cover of jungle on the river-bank, the Russian cavalry\r\nand the Mohammedan auxiliaries of the Russian army succeeded in forcing\r\nthe passage and in throwing our sepoy regiments into disorder. The\r\ntroops of the Maharajah of Chanidigot traitorously went over to the\r\nenemy and that decided the day against us. Had not all the sepoy\r\nregiments deserted, I could have maintained my ground, but the English\r\nregiments under my command were too weak to resist for long the superior\r\nnumbers of the enemy. The bravery of these regiments deserves the\r\nhighest praise, but after a battle lasting several hours I was compelled\r\nto give the order to retreat. We fell back upon the city of Lahore, and\r\nI contrived to convey a portion of my troops by railway to Delhi. This\r\ncity I shall defend to the bitter end. Reinforcements are being sent\r\nfrom all military stations in the country. The extent of our losses I\r\nam unable to give at the time of writing. I have been able to bring five\r\nthousand troops intact to Delhi.”\r\n\r\nThe reading of this terrible report was succeeded by a chilling silence.\r\nThen the Minister of War arose and said:--\r\n\r\n“This despatch certainly comes upon us as a staggering blow. Our best\r\ngeneral and his army, composed of the flower of India’s troops, have\r\nbeen defeated. We may rightly say, however, that our power is still\r\nestablished on a firm basis, so long as England, this seagirt isle, is\r\nsafe from the enemy. No defeat in India or in any one of our colonies\r\ncan deal us a death-blow. What we lose in one portion of the world, we\r\ncan recover, and that doubly, in another, so long as we, in our island,\r\nare sound in both head and heart. But that is just what makes me\r\nanxious. The security of Great Britain is menaced when we have almost\r\nthe whole world in arms against us. A strong French army is standing\r\nready opposite Dover to invade us, and a German army is in Holland also\r\nprepared to make a descent on our coasts. I ask what measures have been\r\ntaken to meet an attack upon our mother country?”\r\n\r\n“The British fleet,” replied the First Lord of the Admiralty, “is strong\r\nenough to crush the fleets of our enemies should they dare to show\r\nthemselves on the open seas. But the Russian, French, and German\r\nnavies are clever enough to remain in harbour under the cover of\r\nthe fortifications. We have, too, fleets in the Channel, one of ten\r\nbattleships and eighteen cruisers, and the necessary smaller vessels,\r\ntold off to engage the German fleet; and a second, a stronger force, of\r\nfourteen battleships and twenty-four cruisers, destined to annihilate\r\nthe French fleet. A third fleet is in the harbour of Copenhagen in order\r\nto prevent a union being effected between the Russian and German\r\nfleets. The plan of sailing for Cronstadt has been abandoned, from the\r\nexperiences of the Crimean War and the fear that we should be keeping\r\nour naval forces too far apart. Our admirals and captains will, owing to\r\nthe Russian successes, be convinced that England’s honour and England’s\r\nvery existence are now at stake. When in the eighteenth century we swept\r\nthe sea power of France from all the seas and vanquished the fleet of\r\nthe Great Napoleon, the rule was laid down that every defeated admiral\r\nand captain in our navy should be court-martialled and shot, and that\r\neven where the victory of our ships of war was not followed up and taken\r\nthe utmost advantage of, the court-martial was to remove the commander.\r\nThe time has now arrived when those old, strict rules must be again\r\nenforced.”\r\n\r\n“According to the last Admiralty reports,” said the First Lord of the\r\nTreasury, “the fleet consists of twenty-seven new ironclads, the oldest\r\nof which is of the year 1895. The ironclads of 1902, the Albemarle,\r\nCornwallis, Duncan, Exmouth, Montagu, and Russell, as well as those\r\nof 1899, Bulwark, Formidable, Implacable, Irresistible, London, and\r\nVenerable are, as I see from the report, constructed and armed according\r\nto the latest technical principles. Are all the most recent twenty-seven\r\nbattleships with the Channel fleet?”\r\n\r\n“No; the Albion, the Ocean, and the Glory are in other waters. The\r\ntwelve newest ironclads which your lordship mentioned are included in\r\nboth Channel fleets; in addition, several older battleships, such as the\r\nCenturion, Royal Sovereign, and Empress of India are in the Channel. I\r\nmay say with truth that both the Channel Squadrons are fully suited for\r\nthe tasks before them. We have, besides, twenty-four ironclads of an\r\nolder type, all of which are of excellent value in battle.”\r\n\r\n“Among these older ironclads are there not many which are equipped with\r\nmuzzle-loaders?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but a naval battle has yet to determine whether the general view\r\nthat breechloaders are more serviceable in action is correct or not.\r\nIn the case of quick-firing guns it is certain that the breechloader\r\nis alone the right construction; but in our heaviest guns, which have a\r\nbore of 30.5 centimetre, and require three to four minutes to load, the\r\nadvantage of quick-firing is not apparent, for here everything depends\r\nupon accurate aim, so that the heavy projectile may hit the right place.\r\nFor this purpose clever manoeuvring is everything. Moreover, the battles\r\nround Port Arthur show us the importance of the torpedo and the mine.\r\nThe Russian fleet has met with its heaviest losses owing to the clever\r\nmanoeuvring and the superior torpedo tactics of the Japanese. It looks\r\nas if in modern naval battles artillery would prove altogether inferior\r\nto mines, and here our superiority in submarines will soon show itself\r\nwhen we attack the fleets of Germany and France in their harbours. Only\r\na naval engagement between our squadrons and those of the French and\r\nGermans can teach us the proper use of modern ships of war. And it will\r\nbe a lesson, a proper lesson for those misguided people who dare expose\r\nthemselves to the fire of a British broadside and the attack of our\r\ntorpedo and submarine boats. Let the steel plating of the vessels be as\r\nit will, the best cuirass of Great Britain is the firm, true breast of\r\nBritons.”\r\n\r\n“When I hear these explanations,” the Colonial Minister interjected, “I\r\ncannot suppress the suspicion, that the whole plan of our naval strategy\r\nis rotten.”\r\n\r\n“I beg you to give your reasons for your suspicion,” the First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty replied, somewhat irritated.\r\n\r\n“It has ever been said that England rules the waves. Now the war has\r\nbeen going on for a considerable time and I perceive nothing of our\r\nboasted supremacy.”\r\n\r\n“How can you say so? Our enemies’ commerce has been completely\r\nparalysed, while our own ships carry on their trade everywhere as freely\r\nas ever.”\r\n\r\n“That may be the case, but by naval supremacy I mean something quite\r\ndifferent. No naval victory has as yet been gained. The enemies’ fleets\r\nare still undamaged: until they are annihilated there is always a danger\r\nthat the war may take a turn prejudicial to us. Only the struggle on the\r\nopen sea can decide the issue. If the English fleet is really supreme,\r\nshe can force the enemies’ ships to a decisive action. Why do we not\r\nblockade the French and German fleets in their harbours, and compel them\r\nto give us battle? Our guns carry three miles, we can attack our enemies\r\nin their harbours. What is the meaning of this division of our fleet\r\ninto three squadrons? Our whole fleet ought to be concentrated in the\r\nChannel, in order to deal a crushing blow.”\r\n\r\n“The right honourable gentleman forgets that a combination of our fleet\r\nwould also entail the concentration of our enemies’ fleets. If we leave\r\nour position at Copenhagen, a strong Russian fleet will proceed from\r\nCronstadt and join the German warships in the Baltic. This united fleet\r\ncould pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal into the North Sea. England\r\nin its naval preparations has always adopted the ‘two power standard,’\r\nand although we have aimed at the ‘three power standard,’ our resources\r\nin money and personnel are not capable of fitting out a naval force\r\nsuperior to the fleets of the now three allied Powers. All the same, our\r\nown prestige holds these three Powers so far in check that they dare not\r\nattack us on the open seas. Should we not be hazarding this prestige\r\nin provoking a naval battle without a definite chance of success?\r\nThis naval battle will take place, but the favourable moment must be\r\ncarefully chosen. Considering the present state of the war, it would be\r\nin the highest degree frivolous to stake all upon one throw of the dice.\r\nWell, that is exactly what we should be doing were we to force on a\r\nnaval conflict. If the attack failed, if our fleet suffered a defeat,\r\nEngland would be then exposed to the invasion of a Continental army. It\r\nis true that our fleet is weakened by being split up, but the same\r\nis also true of the fleets of our enemies, so that this apparent\r\ndisadvantage is equalised. We must keep on the watch for the moment\r\nwhen some alteration of the present situation permits us to attack our\r\nenemies’ fleets with a superior force.”\r\n\r\n“There might be a way of enticing the German fleet into the open,”\r\n maintained the Colonial Minister. “Let us send an ironclad squadron\r\nto Heligoland and bombard the island and its fortifications until it\r\ncrumbles into the sea. The acquisition of Heligoland was the Emperor\r\nWilliam’s darling idea, and this monarch will take good care that\r\nHeligoland does not disappear from the earth’s surface. But if, in spite\r\nof the bombardment of Heligoland, the Germans do not come out into the\r\nopen sea, let us send our fleet up the Elbe and lay Hamburg in ashes.\r\nLet our warships put to sea from Copenhagen and destroy Kiel harbour\r\nand all the German coast towns on the Baltic. Then the German fleet will\r\nsoon enough put out to meet us!”\r\n\r\n“This plan has already been considered, and will perhaps be acted upon.\r\nThere are, however, two difficulties in the way. First of all, by the\r\ndestruction of unfortified towns we should be conjuring up odium against\r\nus, which--”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! there is no ‘odium’ for a victor! England would never have\r\nattained its present might and grandeur had it allowed itself to be\r\ndeterred by a too delicate regard for humanity and the law of nations\r\nfrom taking practical steps.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and then there is, at any rate, the second consideration.”\r\n\r\n“And that is, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“A battle of ships, even though they have the finest possible armour,\r\nagainst land fortifications, is always a hazardous undertaking, and more\r\nespecially when the coasts are defended by innumerable mines and torpedo\r\nboats. Moreover, ironclads are very expensive, and are, in a certain\r\nsense, very fragile things.”\r\n\r\n“Fragile things?”\r\n\r\n“The Germans have removed all their light-ships, all their buoys,\r\nand, like the French, the German ports are also defended by mines. An\r\nironclad, given calm sea, is strong as against another ship, but the\r\nnature of its build makes it weak in a storm and in insecure waters.\r\nAn ironclad, owing to its enormously heavy armament, goes to the bottom\r\nvery rapidly, as soon as it gets a heavy list either on the one side or\r\nthe other. Again, owing to its enormous weight, it can never ram another\r\nvessel for fear of breaking to pieces itself; if a torpedo strikes its\r\narmour, or if the ship runs upon a mine, the explosion will send it to\r\nthe bottom with greater ease than it would a wooden ship of a century\r\nago. And then, if it runs on a shallow or a rock it cannot be brought\r\noff again. Moreover, its supply of coal requires to be constantly\r\nrenewed, so that it cannot be sent on long expeditions. Our ironclads\r\nhave their own specific purpose--they are intended for a naval battle.\r\nBut they are like giants, are rendered top-heavy by their own weight,\r\nand are thus easily capsized, and the loss of an ironclad battleship,\r\napart from the effect it might have upon our chances in the war, entails\r\nthe loss of more than a million pounds. The cruisers, again, I would not\r\nwithout urgent necessity expose to the steel projectiles of a Krupp’s\r\ncoast battery. Let us take care not to suffer the smallest disaster at\r\nsea! It would be as dangerous for our prestige and for our position as\r\na world-power as a steel shot would be for the water-line of one of our\r\nships of war.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonial Minister was silent. He had nothing to urge against these\r\nobjections.\r\n\r\n“Our Indian troops are greatly in need of reinforcements,” began the\r\nPrime Minister again. “We must put English soldiers into the field, for\r\nwe cannot rely longer upon the sepoys.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said the Minister of War, “and drafts are constantly being\r\ndespatched to Bombay. Forty thousand men have been embarked; of these\r\nmore than twenty thousand have been landed in India; the remainder are\r\nstill on the sea. A great fleet is on the road, and eight ironclads\r\nare stationed in Aden to meet any attack upon our transports. But it\r\nis really a question whether we are well advised in still sending more\r\ntroops to India. My lords! hard as it is for me to say so, we must be\r\nprudent. I should be rightly accused of having lost my head if I did\r\nmore than bare prudence demanded. Great Britain is denuded of troops.\r\nNow, I know full well, and England also knows it full well, that an\r\nenemy will never plant his foot on these shores; for our fleet assures\r\nus the inviolability of our island, but we should not be worthy of our\r\nresponsible positions were we to neglect any measure for the security of\r\nour country. Let us, my lords, be cowards before the battle, provided we\r\nare heroes in it! Let us suppose that we had no fleet, but had to defend\r\nEngland’s territory on land. We must have an army on English soil ready\r\nto take the field; failing this, we are guilty of treason against our\r\ncountry. The mobilisation of our reserve must be further extended. Ten\r\nthousand yeomen, whom we have not yet summoned to the ranks, are to-day\r\nin a position to bear arms and wave the sword. To-day every capable man\r\nmust be enlisted. The law provides that every man who does not already\r\nbelong to a regular army or to a volunteer corps can, from eighteen to\r\nfifty years of age, be forced to join the army, and thus a militia\r\ncan be formed of all men capable of bearing arms. If His Majesty will\r\nsanction it, I am ready to form a militia army of 150,000 men. I reckon\r\nfor India 120,000 men, for Malta 10,000, for Hong Kong 3,500, for Africa\r\n10,000, 3,000 for the Antilles, for Gibraltar 6,000, and 10,000 more\r\nfor Egypt, apart from the smaller garrisons, which must all remain\r\nwhere they are at present; I shall then hope, after having called up all\r\nvolunteers and reserves, to be in a position to place an army of 400,000\r\nmen in the field for the defence of the mother country.”\r\n\r\nThe First Lord of the Treasury shook his head. “Do not let us be lulled\r\nby such figures into false optimism! Great masses without military\r\ndiscipline, unused to firearms, with newly appointed officers (and they\r\nchosen, moreover, by the men whom they are to command), troops\r\nwithout any practical intelligence, without any understanding of the\r\nrequirements of modern warfare, such are the men, as I understand,\r\nwe are to place in the field against such splendid troops, as are the\r\nFrench and German. Whence should we get our artillery? In 1871 we\r\nsaw the result, when masses of men with muskets were pitted against\r\nregularly disciplined troops. Bourbaki was in command of an army that\r\nhad been disciplined for months gone by, and yet his host, although they\r\ntook the field with cavalry and artillery, suffered enormous losses on\r\nmeeting an army numerically inferior, yet well-organised, and commanded\r\nby scientific and experienced officers. They were pushed across the\r\nfrontier into Switzerland, like a great flock of sheep pursued by a bevy\r\nof wolves.”\r\n\r\n“But they were French, and we are Englishmen!”\r\n\r\n“An Englishman can be laid low by a bullet as well as a Frenchman.\r\nThe days of the Black Prince are past and gone, no Henry V. is to-day\r\nvictorious at Agincourt, we have to fight with firearms and magazine\r\nrifles.”\r\n\r\n“The Boers, my lord, showed us what a brave militia is capable of doing\r\nagainst regular troops.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, in the mountains. The Tyrolese held out in the same way against\r\nthe great Napoleon for a while. But England is a flat country, and in\r\nthe plain tactical strategy soon proves its superiority. No, England’s\r\nsalvation rests entirely on her fleet.”\r\n\r\nA despatch from the Viceroy of India was handed to the Prime\r\nMinister: “The Viceroy informs His Majesty’s Government that the\r\nCommander-in-Chief in Delhi has massed an army of 30,000 men, and will\r\ndefend the city. The sepoys attached to his army are loyal, because they\r\nare confined within the fortifications and cannot flee. The Viceroy will\r\ntake care that the Mohammedan sepoys shall all, as far as possible,\r\nbe brought south, and that only Hindu troops shall be led against the\r\nRussians. Orders have been given that the treacherous Maharajah of\r\nChanidigot, whose troops in the battle of Lahore gave the signal for\r\ndesertion, shall be shot. The Viceroy is of opinion that the\r\nRussian army will have to halt before Delhi in order to collect the\r\nreinforcements which, though in smaller numbers, are still coming up\r\nthrough Afghanistan. He does not doubt that the English army, whose\r\nnumbers are daily increasing by the addition of fresh regiments, will,\r\nwhen massed in the northern provinces, deal the Russians a decisive\r\nblow. The Commander-in-Chief will leave to General Egerton the defence\r\nof Delhi, and concentrate a new field army at Cawnpore, with which it\r\nis his intention to advance to Delhi. All lines of railway are now\r\nconstantly engaged in forwarding all available troops to Cawnpore.”\r\n\r\n“This news is, at all events, calculated to inspire new courage,” said\r\nthe Prime Minister after reading the telegram, “and we will not disguise\r\nfrom ourselves the fact, my lords, that we need courage now more than\r\never. This new man in Germany, whom the Emperor has made Chancellor,\r\nis arousing the feelings of the Germans most alarmingly against us.\r\nHe appears to be a man of the Bismarck stamp, full of insolent\r\ninconsiderateness and of a surprising initiative. We stand quite\r\nisolated in the world; Russia, France, and Germany are leagued against\r\nus. Austria cannot and will not help us, Italy temporises in reply to\r\nour advances, says neither ‘yes’ nor ‘no,’ and seeks an opportunity of\r\nallying herself with France and wresting the remainder of the Italian\r\nterritories from Austria and of aggrandising herself at the expense\r\nof our colonies. Yet, whenever England has stood alone, she has always\r\nstood in the halo of glory and power. Let us trust in our own right hand\r\nand in the loyalty of our colonies, who are ready to come to our aid\r\nwith money and men, and whom, after our victory, we will repay with all\r\nthose good gifts that His Majesty’s Government can dispense.”\r\n\r\n“Our colonies!” the Minister of the Board of Trade intervened. “You are\r\nright, they are ready to make sacrifices. Only I am afraid that those\r\nsacrifices which the Right Honourable the Minister for the Colonies\r\ndemands of them will be too great, and that, having regard to the\r\ntendency of the modern imperialism of our Government, they will not\r\nbelieve in those rewards that are to be dangled before their eyes.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” replied the last speaker, “I am considered an agitator, and\r\nam accused of being responsible for the present perilous position of\r\nEngland. Well, I will accept that responsibility. Never in the world’s\r\nhistory did a statesman entertain great plans without exposing his\r\ncountry to certain risks. I remind you how Bismarck, after the war of\r\n1866 had been fought to a successful issue, said that the old women\r\nwould have beaten him to death with cudgels had the Prussian army been\r\ndefeated. But it was not defeated, and he stood before them as a man\r\nwho had united Germany and made Prussia great. He exposed Prussia to the\r\ngreatest risks, in that by his agitation he made almost the whole world\r\nPrussia’s enemy, declared war upon Austria and upon the whole of South\r\nGermany, and forced the latter eventually to engage in the war against\r\nFrance. England at that time pursued the luckless policy of observing\r\nand waiting for an opportunity, merely because no agitator conducted its\r\npolicy. Had England in 1866 declared war against Prussia, Germany would\r\nnot to-day be so powerful as to be able to wage war upon us. Since those\r\ndays, profound changes have taken place in England itself, and entirely\r\nowing to the growth of the German power. Since the fall of Napoleon,\r\nwe have not troubled ourselves sufficiently about events upon the\r\nContinent, but in our proud self-assurance have thought ourselves so\r\npowerful, that we only needed to influence the decisions of foreign\r\ngovernments, in order to pursue our own lines of policy. But this\r\nself-assurance suffered a severe shock in the events of 1866 and 1870,\r\nand England has, and rightly enough, become nervous. The Englishman down\r\nto that period despised the forward policy of the Continental powers.\r\nThis is no longer the case, but, on the other hand patriotic tendencies\r\nare at work even in England itself, which are branded by the weak-minded\r\napostles of peace as chauvinistic. Let that pass, I am proud to call\r\nmyself a chauvinist in the sense that I do not desire peace at any\r\nprice, but peace only for England’s welfare. The patriotic tendencies\r\nof our people have been directed into their proper channel by my\r\npredecessor Chamberlain. And has not the Government for the last thirty\r\nyears hearkened to these patriotic feelings, in that, whether led by\r\nDisraeli or Gladstone, it has brought about an enormous strengthening of\r\nour defensive forces both on land and sea? These military preparations,\r\nwhilst not only redounding to the advantage of the motherland, but also\r\nto that of the colonies (which they shall ever continue to do) have\r\nsaddled the mother country with the entire burden of expenditure. But\r\nhow shall the enormous cost of this war be met for the future? How shall\r\nthe commerce of the English world-empire be increased in the future and\r\nprotected from competition, if the colonies do not share in the expense?\r\nI vote for a just distribution of the burdens, and maintain that not\r\nEngland alone but that the colonies also should share in bearing them.\r\nThe plan of Imperial Federation, a policy which we are pursuing, is the\r\nremedy for our chronic disease, and will strengthen the colonies and the\r\nmother country in economic, political, and military respects. Certainly,\r\nmy lords, such utterances will appear to you to be somewhat impertinent,\r\nat a time when a Russian army has invaded India and our army has\r\nsuffered a severe defeat, but I should wish to remind you that every war\r\nthat England has yet waged has begun with defeats. But England has never\r\nwaged other than victorious wars since William the Conqueror infused\r\nRomanic blood into England’s political life and thus gave it a\r\nconstitution of such soundness and tenacity that no other body politic\r\nhas ever been able permanently to resist England. We shall again, as in\r\ndays of yore, drive the Russians out of India, shall force the fleets\r\nof France, Germany, and Russia who are now hiding in their harbours\r\ninto the open, annihilate them, and thwart all the insolent plans of our\r\nenemies, and finally raise the Union Jack as a standard of a world-power\r\nthat no one will for evermore be able to attack.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG RUSSIAN CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news of Edith’s kidnapping--for, in Heideck’s opinion, this was the\r\nonly explanation, because she would otherwise have left a message for\r\nhim--fell upon Heideck as a crushing blow.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the terrible cruelties narrated of the period of the Sepoy\r\nmutiny. And he only needed to remember his own experiences in Lahore to\r\nbe convinced that all those horrible stories were no exaggeration, but,\r\nrather, well within the actual truth of the facts.\r\n\r\nBut if it was not a like fate that awaited Edith Irwin, yet perhaps\r\nanother ignominious lot would be hers, and this could not fail to\r\nappear, to the man who loved her, more terrible even than death itself.\r\n\r\nHis alarm and deep despondency had not escaped the notice of the Prince.\r\nHe laid his hand sympathetically on Heideck’s shoulder, and said--\r\n\r\n“I am really quite miserable, comrade! for I now see what you and the\r\nlady are to each other. But perhaps you make yourself uneasy without\r\ncause; the departure of the lady is capable, perhaps, of a quite simple\r\nexplanation.”\r\n\r\nHeideck shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I do not entertain any hope in this respect, for everything points to\r\nthe fact that the Maharajah of Chanidigot is the man who has got the\r\nlady into his power. This sensual despot has for months past schemed how\r\nto obtain possession of her. What, in Heaven’s name, is to be done to\r\nfree the unhappy creature from his clutches?”\r\n\r\n“I will inform the General, and doubt not that he will institute an\r\ninquiry. If your supposition is correct, the Maharajah will, of course,\r\nbe compelled to set the lady free. But I doubt if this is the case. The\r\ndespot of Chanidigot is at present far away.”\r\n\r\n“That would not prevent others from acting on his orders. And do you\r\nreally believe that your General would, for the sake of an English\r\nlady, offend an influential Indian prince, whose alliance would at this\r\npresent moment be very advantageous for Russia?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear friend, we are not the barbarians we are held to be in\r\nWestern Europe. We do not intend to be behind the rest of the world in\r\nchivalrous actions, and we certainly should not begin our rule in India\r\nby allowing execrable deeds of violence to take place before our very\r\neyes. I am convinced that the General does not in this matter think\r\ndifferently from myself.”\r\n\r\n“You do not know what a great comfort it is to me to hear that; for I\r\nshall myself be unable to do anything more for Mrs. Irwin. Since I know\r\nthat Germany is engaged in the war, I can have no further interest but\r\nto join my army as quickly as possible.”\r\n\r\n“Of course! A soldier’s duty first. But how shall you manage to get to\r\nGermany? It will be a devilish hard job.”\r\n\r\n“I must try all the same. Under no circumstances could I remain quietly\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, let us consider matters. The best plan would be for you to\r\nreturn by sea from Bombay or some other port, like Calcutta, Madras,\r\nor Karachi. Karachi is nearest. It has even been given the name of the\r\nEntrance Gate to Central Asia. And from Lahore, Quetta, or Mooltan,\r\nKarachi can be most readily reached by the railway. Steamship\r\ncommunication between Karachi and Europe is only possible by way of\r\nBombay; there is thence no other direct line of steamers than that\r\nplying up the Persian Gulf. You must accordingly go by one of the\r\nEnglish steamers of the P. and O. line, which start twice a week. The\r\nFrench Messageries Maritimes, which usually sail between Karachi\r\nand Marseilles, will, of course, have long since discontinued their\r\nservices. You could, therefore, just as well go by railway to Bombay.\r\nVia Calcutta or Madras would be a roundabout journey.”\r\n\r\n“And I should be entirely dependent upon the English steamship lines?”\r\n\r\n“I consider it quite out of the question that the ships of the North\r\nGerman Lloyd or the Austrian Lloyd are still running.”\r\n\r\n“Then I shall have to give up the idea of this route altogether. For if\r\nI am not to make use of a forged passport, which, moreover, will be very\r\nhard to obtain, no English steamer will take me as a passenger.”\r\n\r\n“That is certainly very probable,” the Prince rejoined, after some\r\nthought. “And then--how are you to get to Bombay? The English are, of\r\ncourse, destroying all the railways on their line of retreat.”\r\n\r\n“Well, so far as that is concerned, I could go on horseback.”\r\n\r\n“What! right through the English army? and at the risk of being arrested\r\nfor a spy? Are you not aware that the conquered are, as a rule, smarter\r\nat shooting those whom they regard as spies than are the victors?”\r\n\r\nHeideck could not suppress a smile.\r\n\r\n“In this respect the promptness of the Russian procedure could\r\nscarcely be excelled. But I allow, that your fears are quite justified.\r\nAccordingly, only the road to the north remains open.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you must go to the Khyber Pass on an empty train or with\r\na transport of English prisoners, and then on horseback through\r\nAfghanistan to the frontier, and thence again by railway to\r\nKransnovodsk. Your journey would then be across the Caspian to Baku or\r\nby railway by way of Tiflis to Poti on the Black Sea and thence by ship\r\nto Constantinople. But, my dear comrade, that’s a very long and arduous\r\njourney.”\r\n\r\n“I shall have to attempt it all the same. Honour commands; and you\r\nyourself say that there is no other route than that you have described.”\r\n\r\n“Right!--I will take care you are provided with a passport, and will\r\nrequest the General to furnish you with an authority which will\r\nenable you to have at any time an escort of Cossacks upon our lines of\r\ncommunication through Afghanistan--But--”\r\n\r\nA gleam of pleasure in his face showed that in his view he had hit upon\r\na very happy thought--“Might there not, perhaps, after all be found some\r\nsolution which would save you all this exertion? The Germans and the\r\nRussians are allies. In the ranks of our army you would also be able to\r\nserve your fatherland. And an officer who knows India as well as you,\r\nwould be invaluable to us at the present time. I will, if you like,\r\nspeak at once with the General; and I am certain that he will not\r\nhesitate a moment to attach you to his staff with the rank that you hold\r\nin the German army.”\r\n\r\nHeideck shook his friend’s hand with emotion.\r\n\r\n“You make it difficult for me to thank you as you deserve. Without your\r\nintervention, my existence would have come to an inglorious close, and\r\nthe proposal you now make to me is a new proof of your amiable sympathy.\r\nBut you will not be vexed if I decline your offer--will you? It would\r\ncertainly be a great honour to serve in your splendid army, but you see\r\nI cannot dispose of myself as I would, but must, as a soldier, return to\r\nmy post irrespective of the difficulties I may have to encounter. I beg\r\nyou--Lord! what’s that? in this land of miracles even the dead come to\r\nlife again.”\r\n\r\nThe astonishment that prompted this question was a very natural one, for\r\nthe lean, dark-skinned little man who had just appeared at the entrance\r\nof the tent was no other than his faithful servant Morar Gopal whom he\r\nhad believed to be dead. Round his forehead he wore a fresh bandage. For\r\na moment he stood stock-still at the entrance to the tent, and his dark\r\neyes beamed with pleasure at having found his master again unharmed.\r\n\r\nHardly able to restrain his emotion, Morar Gopal advanced towards\r\nHeideck, prostrated himself on the ground, Hindu fashion, in order to\r\ntouch the earth with his forehead, and then sprang to his feet with all\r\nthe appearance of the greatest joy.\r\n\r\nBut Heideck was scarcely less moved than the other, and pressed the\r\nbrown hand of his faithful servant warmly.\r\n\r\n“These lunatics did not kill you after all then? But I saw you felled to\r\nthe ground by their blows.”\r\n\r\nMorar Gopal grinned cunningly.\r\n\r\n“I threw myself down as soon as I saw that further resistance was\r\nuseless. And, because I was bleeding from a wound in the head, they\r\nthought, I suppose, that they had finished me. Directly afterwards the\r\nCossacks came, and in front of their horses, which would otherwise have\r\ntrampled upon me, I quickly scrambled to my feet.”\r\n\r\n“You have great presence of mind! But where did you get this fine suit\r\nof clothes?”\r\n\r\n“I ran back to the hotel--through the back door, where the smoke was\r\nnot so stifling--because I thought that sahib would perhaps have taken\r\nrefuge there. I did not find sahib, but I found these clothes, and\r\nthought it better to put them on than to leave them to burn.”\r\n\r\n“Quite right, my brave fellow! you will hardly be brought up for this\r\nlittle theft.”\r\n\r\n“I looked for sahib everywhere, where English prisoners are; and when\r\nI came to Anar Kali just at the moment that Mrs. Irwin was being driven\r\naway in a carriage, I knew that I was at length on the track of my\r\nmaster.”\r\n\r\nHeideck violently clutched his arm.\r\n\r\n“You saw it? and you know, too, who it was that took her away?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, it was Siwalik, the Master of the Horse to Prince Tasatat;\r\nand the lady is now with him on the road to Simla.”\r\n\r\n“Simla! How do you know that?”\r\n\r\n“I was near enough to hear every word that the Indians spoke, and they\r\nsaid that they were going to Simla.”\r\n\r\n“And Mrs. Irwin? She didn’t resist? She didn’t cry for help? She allowed\r\nherself to be carried off quietly?”\r\n\r\n“The lady was very proud. She did not say a word.”\r\n\r\nAn orderly officer stepped into the tent and brought the Prince an order\r\nto appear at once before the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what about?” asked the Colonel.\r\n\r\n“As far as I know, it concerns a report of Captain Obrutschev, who\r\ncommanded the file of men told off for the execution. He reported that\r\nthe Colonel had carried away a spy who was to be shot by order of the\r\ncourt-martial.”\r\n\r\nHeideck was in consternation.\r\n\r\n“Your act of grace is, after all, likely to land you in serious\r\ndifficulties,” he said. “But, as I need now no longer conceal my quality\r\nas German officer, I can, in case the field telegraph is working, be\r\nable to establish my identity by inquiry at the General Staff of the\r\nGerman Army.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly! and I entreat you not to be uneasy on my account; I shall\r\nsoon justify the action I have taken.”\r\n\r\nHe disappeared in company of the orderly officer; and Heideck the\r\nwhile plied the brave Morar Gopal afresh with questions as to the\r\ncircumstances connected with Edith’s kidnapping.\r\n\r\nBut the Hindu could not tell him anything more, as he had not dared\r\napproach Edith. He was only concerned with the endeavour to find his\r\nmaster. He had learnt that Heideck had been carried off by Cossacks and\r\nindefatigably pursued his investigations until at last, with the inborn\r\nacumen peculiar to his race, he had found out everything. That he, from\r\nthis time forth, would share the lot of his adored sahib appeared to him\r\na matter of course. And Heideck had not the heart, in this hour of their\r\nmeeting again, to destroy his illusion.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of half an hour Prince Tchajawadse returned. His joyous\r\ncountenance showed that he was the bearer of good news.\r\n\r\n“All is settled. My word was bond enough for the General, and he\r\nconsidered an inquiry in Berlin quite superfluous.”\r\n\r\n“In truth, you Russians do everything on a grand scale,” exclaimed\r\nHeideck. “A great Empire, a great army, a wide, far-seeing policy, and a\r\ngreat comprehension for all things.”\r\n\r\n“I also talked to the General touching my suggestion to include you in\r\nthe ranks of our army, and he is completely of one mind with me in the\r\nmatter. He also considers the difficulties of a journey to Germany under\r\nthe present conditions to be almost unsurmountable. He makes you the\r\noffer to enter his staff with the rank of captain. Under the most\r\nfavourable conditions you would only be able to reach Berlin after the\r\nwar is over.”\r\n\r\n“I do not believe that this war will be so soon at an end. Only reflect,\r\nhalf the globe is in flames.”\r\n\r\n“All the same, you ought not to reject his offer. We could, to ease your\r\nmind, make inquiries on your behalf in Berlin. The field telegraph\r\nis open as far as Peshawar, and there is consequently connexion with\r\nMoscow, St. Petersburg, and Berlin.”\r\n\r\n“I accept without further consideration. I should be happy, if\r\npermission were granted, to fight in your ranks.”\r\n\r\n“There is no doubt of that whatever. I will at once procure you our\r\nwhite summer uniform and that of a captain of dragoons; and this sword,\r\ncomrade, I hope you will accept from me as a small gift of friendship.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you from my heart, Colonel.”\r\n\r\n“I salute you as one of ours. I might even be in a position to give you\r\nat once an order to carry out.”\r\n\r\n“But not without permission from Berlin, Prince?”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, we will wait for it; but it would be a great pity if,\r\ncontrary to our expectation, it were to be delayed. The commission that\r\nI was on the point of procuring for you would certainly have greatly\r\ninterested you.”\r\n\r\n“And may I ask--”\r\n\r\n“The General has the intention to send a detachment to Simla.”\r\n\r\n“To Simla, the summer residence of the Viceroy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But this mountain town is at the present moment not within the sphere\r\nof hostilities; the Viceroy remains in Calcutta.”\r\n\r\n“Quite right; but that does not preclude the news of the occupation\r\nof Simla having a great effect on the world at large. Moreover, in\r\nthe Government offices there there might possibly be found interesting\r\ndocuments which it would be worth while to intercept.”\r\n\r\n“And you consider it possible that His Excellency would despatch me\r\nthither?”\r\n\r\n“As the detachment to which my dragoons, as well as some infantry and\r\ntwo machine guns, would belong is under my command, I have begged the\r\nGeneral to attach you to the expedition.”\r\n\r\nHeideck understood the high-minded intentions of the Prince, and shook\r\nhis hands almost impetuously.\r\n\r\n“Heaven grant that permission from Berlin comes in time! I desire\r\nnothing in the world so earnestly as to accompany you to Simla.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nON THE ROAD TO SIMLA\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost quicker than could have been expected, considering the heavy work\r\nimposed upon the telegraph wires, the communication arrived from Berlin\r\nthat Captain Heideck should, for the time being, do duty in the Russian\r\narmy, and that it should be left to his judgment to take the first\r\nfavourable opportunity to return to Germany.\r\n\r\nHe forthwith waited upon the commanding general, was initiated into his\r\nnew role formally and by handshake, and was in all due form attached as\r\ncaptain to the detachment that was commanded to proceed to Simla.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the cavalcade set out under the command of Prince\r\nTchajawadse.\r\n\r\nTheir route led across a part of the battlefield lying east of Lahore,\r\nwhere the battle between the sepoys and the pursuing Russian cavalry had\r\nprincipally taken place.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this trampled, bloodstained plain was shockingly sad.\r\nAlthough numerous Indian and Russian soldiers under the military police\r\nwere engaged in picking up the corpses, there still lay everywhere\r\naround the horribly mutilated bodies of the fallen in the postures in\r\nwhich they had been overtaken by a more or less painful death. An almost\r\nintolerable odour of putrefaction filled the air, and mingled with the\r\nbiting, stifling smoke of the funeral pyres upon which the corpses were\r\nbeing burnt.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the Russian army was in the camp and in the city.\r\nOnly the advance guard, which had returned from the pursuit of the\r\nfleeing English, had taken up a position to the south of the city. The\r\nreinforcements which had been despatched from Peshawar, and which had\r\nbeen impatiently expected, had not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nHeideck heard that about 4,000 English soldiers and more than 1,000\r\nofficers were dead and wounded, while 3,000 men and 85 officers were\r\nprisoners in the hands of the Russians. The losses of the sepoy regiment\r\ncould not at present be approximately determined, as the battle had\r\nextended over too wide an area.\r\n\r\nPrince Tchajawadse, although showing the same friendly feeling towards\r\nHeideck, now adopted more the attitude of his military superior. He\r\nnarrated during the journey that the Russian army was taking the road\r\nthrough the west provinces, and would leave the valley of the Indus, and\r\nthe country immediately bordering it, unmolested.\r\n\r\n“We shall march to Delhi,” he said, “and then probably advance upon\r\nCawnpore and Lucknow.”\r\n\r\nThe detachment was unable to make use of the railway which goes via\r\nAmritsar and Ambala to Simla, because it had been to a great extent\r\ndestroyed by the English. But the rapidity of the march naturally\r\ndepended upon the marching capabilities of the infantry. And although\r\nHeideck could not fail to admire the freshness and endurance of these\r\nhardened soldiers, they yet advanced far too slowly for his wishes.\r\n\r\nHow happy he would have been if, with his squadron, he had been able\r\nto make a forced march upon the road which the unhappy Edith must have\r\ntaken!\r\n\r\nOn the second day after their start, the blue and violet peaks of the\r\nmountains were silhouetted in the distance. It was the mountainous\r\ncountry lying beneath the Himalayas, whose low summer temperature\r\ninduces the Viceroy and the high officials of the Indian Government\r\nevery year to take refuge from the intolerably hot and sultry Calcutta\r\nin the cool and healthy Simla. Moreover, the families of the rich\r\nEnglish merchants and officials living in the Punjab and the west\r\nprovinces are accustomed to take up their quarters there during the hot\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation as they advanced became ever richer and more luxuriant.\r\nTheir way led through splendid jungles, which in places gave the\r\nimpression of artificially made parks. Hosts of monkeys sprang about\r\namong the palms, and took daring leaps from one branch to the other. The\r\napproach of the soldiers did not appear to cause these lively creatures\r\nany appreciable fear, for they often remained seated directly over\r\ntheir heads and regarded the unaccustomed military display with as\r\nmuch inquisitiveness as they evidently did with delight. Parrots in gay\r\nplumage filled the air with shrill cries, while here and there herds\r\nof antelopes were visible, who, however, always dashed away in rapid\r\nflight, in which their strange manner of springing from all fours in the\r\nair afforded a most strange and delightful spectacle.\r\n\r\nOn the third day a gay-coloured cavalcade crossed the path of the\r\ndetachment. They were evidently aristocratic Indians, who in the\r\nhalf-native, half-English dress were seated upon excellent horses,\r\na cross-breed between the Arabian and Gujarat. At their head rode a\r\nsplendidly dressed, dark-bearded man upon a white horse of special\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nHe halted to exchange a few words of civil salutation with the Russian\r\ncolonel. When he had again set himself in motion with his lancers, soon\r\nto be lost to view in the thick jungle, the Prince motioned Heideck to\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\n“I have news for you, comrade! The aristocratic Indian with whom I just\r\nspoke was the Maharajah of Sabathu who is on the look-out for his guest\r\nand friend, the Maharajah of Chanidigot, who is engaged on a hunting\r\nexpedition.”\r\n\r\n“The Maharajah of Chanidigot?” Heideck exclaimed with sparkling eyes.\r\n“The rogue is then really in our immediate neighbourhood?”\r\n\r\n“The hunting-camp that the two Princes have formed lies directly in our\r\nline of march, and the Maharajah has invited me to camp this night there\r\nwith my men. I have really more than half a mind to accept his kind\r\ninvitation.”\r\n\r\n“And did you not inquire about Mrs. Irwin, Prince?”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel’s face assumed at Heideck’s question a strangely serious,\r\nalmost repellent expression.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“But it is more than probable that she is in his camp.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly, although up to now every proof of that is wanting.”\r\n\r\n“But you will institute inquiries for her, will you not? You will compel\r\nthe Maharajah to give us news of her whereabouts?”\r\n\r\n“I can, at most, politely ask him for information. But I cannot promise\r\nyou even that with certainty.”\r\n\r\nHeideck was extremely surprised. He could not explain in any way the\r\nchange in the Prince’s demeanour. And he would have been inclined\r\nto take his strange answers for a not too delicate jest, had not\r\nthe frigid, impenetrable expression of his face at once excluded any\r\nsuggestion of the sort.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t understand, Prince,” he said, surprised. “It was only a few\r\ndays ago that you were kind enough to promise me your active support in\r\nthis matter.”\r\n\r\n“I am to my regret compelled to cancel that promise; for I have received\r\nstrict instructions from His Excellency to avoid everything that can\r\nlead to friction with the native Princes, and that my superiors laid\r\ngreat stress upon a good understanding with the Maharajah of Chanidigot\r\nwas not known to me at the time of our conversation. He was the first\r\nwho openly declared for Russia and whose troops have come over to our\r\nside. The happy issue of the Battle of Lahore is perhaps in no small\r\ndegree due to him. You understand, Captain, that it would make the worst\r\npossible impression were we to come into conflict with a man so needful\r\nto us for such a trifling cause.”\r\n\r\n“Trifling cause?” Heideck asked earnestly, his eyes sparkling with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, what appears to you of such great importance is, when\r\nregarded from a high political point of view, very trifling and\r\ninsignificant. You cannot possibly expect that the political interests\r\nof a world empire should be sacrificed for the interests of a single\r\nlady, who, moreover, by nationality belongs to our enemies.”\r\n\r\n“Shall she then be handed over helpless to the bestiality of this\r\ndissolute scoundrel?”\r\n\r\nPrince Tchajawadse shrugged his shoulders, while at the same time he\r\ncast a strange side-glance at Heideck, who was riding beside him, which\r\nseemed to say--\r\n\r\n“How dense you are, my dear fellow! And how slow of understanding!”\r\n\r\nBut the other did not understand this dumb play of the eyes; and, after\r\na short pause, he could not refrain from saying in a tone of painful\r\nreproach--\r\n\r\n“Why, my Prince, did you so generously procure for me permission to take\r\npart in this expedition if I was at once to be doomed to inaction in\r\na matter, which, as you know, is at present nearer my heart than aught\r\nelse!”\r\n\r\n“I do not remember, Captain, to have imposed any such restraint upon\r\nyou. It was purely my own attitude as regards this matter which I wished\r\nto make clear to you. And I hope that you have completely understood me.\r\nI will not, and dare not, have anything officially to do with the affair\r\nof Mrs. Irwin, and I should like to hear nothing about it. That I, on\r\nthe other hand, do not interfere with your private concerns, and\r\nwould not trouble about them, is quite a matter of course. It entirely\r\nsuffices for me, if you do not bring me into any embarrassment and\r\nimpossible situation.”\r\n\r\nThat was, at all events, much less than Heideck had expected after the\r\nzealous promises of his friend. But after quiet reflection he came to\r\nthe conclusion that the Prince could, as a matter of fact, scarcely act\r\notherwise, and that he went to the utmost limits of the possible, if he\r\ndid not absolutely forbid him to undertake anything for the advantage of\r\nthe unhappy Edith. Heideck’s decision to leave not a stone unturned to\r\nliberate the woman he loved was not thereby shaken for a moment, but he\r\nknew now that he would have to proceed with the greatest circumspection,\r\nand that he could not reckon upon anyone’s assistance--an admission\r\nwhich was not exactly calculated to fill him with joyous hope.\r\n\r\nAfter a short march the detachment reached the spot lying immediately\r\nat the foot of the first hill, a wide space shaded by mighty trees, upon\r\nwhich the Maharajah had erected his improvised hunting-camp. A great\r\nnumber of tents had been pitched under the trees. A gay-coloured throng\r\nof men surged amongst them.\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly clear to Heideck that he could not himself search the\r\ncamp for Edith Irwin without exciting the attention of the Indians,\r\nthereby at once compromising the success of his venture. And he had no\r\none to whom he could entrust the important task, except the faithful\r\nMorar Gopal, who, in spite of all the terrors of war, had also followed\r\nhim on this march to Simla, although Heideck had offered him his\r\ndischarge, together with the payment of his wages for several months\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after the signal had been given to halt and dismount, he\r\ntook him aside and communicated to him his instructions, at the same\r\ntime handing him a handful of rupees to enable him to give the necessary\r\nbribes.\r\n\r\nThe Hindu listened with keen attention, and the play of his dark, clever\r\nface showed what a lively personal interest he took in this affair\r\nnearest his master’s heart.\r\n\r\n“Everything shall be done according to your wishes, sahib,” he said, and\r\nsoon afterwards was lost to view among the innumerable crowd of the two\r\nIndian Princes’ servants and followers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nA FRIEND IN NEED\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst the Russians were digging their cooking trenches somewhat\r\naside from the main camp, and making all necessary arrangements for\r\nbivouacking, Heideck had an opportunity of admiring the magnificence\r\nwith which these Indian Princes organised their hunting excursions.\r\n\r\nThe tents of the two Maharajahs were almost the size of a one-floor\r\nbungalow, and on peering through the open entrance of one of them into\r\nthe interior, Heideck saw that it was lavishly hung with red, blue, and\r\nyellow silk, and furnished with most costly carpets.\r\n\r\nAbout half a hundred smaller tents were destined to receive the\r\nretinue and servants. Behind them again was a whole herd of camels and\r\nelephants, which had carried the baggage and material for the tents. The\r\nbleating of countless sheep mingled with the hundred-voiced din of the\r\nIndians as they busily ran hither and thither, and Heideck computed the\r\nnumber of buffaloes and tethered horses which grazed round the camp at\r\nmore than three hundred.\r\n\r\nThe Maharajah of Sabathu regarded the Russians, who had here made\r\nhalt at his invitation, as his guests, and he discharged the duty of\r\nhospitality with genuine Indian lavishness. He had so many sheep and\r\nother provisions placed at the disposal of the soldiers that they could\r\nnow amply compensate themselves for many a day’s privation in the past.\r\nBut the officers were solemnly bidden to the banquet that was to take\r\nplace in the Maharajah’s tent.\r\n\r\nHeideck’s hope of meeting on this occasion the Maharajah of Chanidigot\r\nonce more, and of perhaps finding an opportunity of conversation with\r\nhim, was disappointed.\r\n\r\nOn returning from a walk through the camp, in which he did not discover\r\nanywhere a trace of Edith, back to the Russian bivouac, Heideck learnt\r\nfrom the mouth of Prince Tchajawadse that the Maharajah of Chanidigot\r\nhad met with a slight accident in the hunting excursion that day, and\r\nwas under surgical treatment in his tent, whither he had been brought.\r\n\r\nIt was said that the tusks of a wild boar, which had run between his\r\nhorse’s legs, had inflicted a severe wound on the foot, and it was in\r\nany case certain that he would not be visible that day.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Heideck also learnt the circumstances to which the\r\nmeeting with the two Indian Princes was due.\r\n\r\nThe Maharajah of Chanidigot, who knew full well that the English had\r\nsentenced him to death for high treason, had fled from his capital. With\r\na hundred horse and many camels, carrying the most precious part of\r\nhis movable treasures, he had advanced northwards out of the sphere of\r\nBritish territory into the rear of the Russian advancing army. He\r\nhad visited his friend, the Maharajah of Sabathu, who was likewise a\r\nMohammedan, and both Princes had for their greater safety proceeded\r\nhither to the foot of the mountain chain, where, for the present,\r\ndespite the exciting times, they could pursue the pleasures of sport\r\nwith all the nonchalance of real gentlemen at large.\r\n\r\nThe treacherous despot of Chanidigot would probably have preferred to\r\nhave gone direct to Simla, and it was only the intelligence that had\r\nreached the Russians, that English troops were still in Ambala, that\r\nprobably caused him to stop half-way.\r\n\r\nPrince Tchajawadse was also induced by this intelligence to abandon his\r\nintended route via Ambala, and to proceed in a direct line through the\r\njungle. In this way he could confidently hope to reach Simla without a\r\nbattle, and, moreover, should it turn out that the garrison of Ambala\r\nwas not over strong, he might deliver a surprise attack upon the\r\nEnglish from the north. In time of peace Ambala was one of the larger\r\nencampments, but now it was to be expected that the main body of the\r\ntroops stationed there had been ordered to Lahore.\r\n\r\nThe whole opulence of an Indian Court was unfolded at the Maharajah’s\r\nbanquet. At the table covered with red velvet and luxuriously laid with\r\ngold and silver plate, the Russian officers sat in gay-coloured ranks\r\nwith the chiefs of the Prince’s retinue. The viands were excellent, and\r\nchampagne flowed in inexhaustible streams. The Russians required but\r\nfew invitations to drink, but the Mohammedan Indians were not in\r\nthis respect far behind them. It is true that the drinking of wine is\r\nforbidden by the tenets of their religion; but in respect of champagne,\r\nthey understand how to evade this commandment by christening it by the\r\nharmless name of “sparkling lemonade,” a circumlocution which of course\r\ndid not in the slightest counteract its exhilarating effects. The\r\nIndians who were less proof against the effects of alcohol were much\r\nmore quickly intoxicated than their new European friends; and under\r\nthe influence of the potent liquor universal fraternisation inevitably\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\nThe Maharajah himself delivered a suggestive speech in praise of the\r\nRussian victors who had at last come as the long-desired saviours of the\r\ncountry from the British yoke. Of course he had to employ the accursed\r\nEnglish language, it being the only one that he understood besides his\r\nown mother tongue; and Prince Tchajawadse had to translate his words\r\ninto Russian in order that they should be intelligible to all the\r\nRussian heroes.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this somewhat troublesome procedure, however, his words\r\nroused intense enthusiasm, and embracings and brotherly kisses were soon\r\nthe order of the day.\r\n\r\nWhen the universal jollity had reached its height, two Bayaderes,\r\nwho belonged to the suite of the Maharajah of Sabathu, made their\r\nappearance, Indian beauties, whose voluptuous feminine charms were\r\ncalculated to make the blood even of the spoilt European run warm.\r\nDressed in gold-glittering petticoats and jackets, which left a hand’s\r\nbreadth of light brown skin visible round the waist, with gold coins\r\nupon the blue-black hair, they executed their dances to the monotonous\r\ntone of weird musical instruments upon a carpet spread in the middle of\r\nthe tent. The bare arms, the bones and toes of their little feet were\r\nadorned with gold bracelets set with pearls and rings bedizened with\r\njewels. Though their motions had nothing in common with the bacchanalian\r\nabandon of other national dances, yet the graceful play of their supple,\r\nlithe limbs was seductive enough to enchant the spectators. The Indians\r\nthrew silver coins to the dancers, but the Russians, according to their\r\nnative custom, clapped applause and never tired of demanding amid shouts\r\nof delight a repetition of the dance.\r\n\r\nAmid the general wantonness there was only one who remained morose and\r\nanxious, and this was Heideck, the newly-made captain in the Russian\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nHe knew that it would be easy for Morar Gopal’s shrewdness to find him\r\nin case he had something to report. And that the Hindu did not make his\r\nappearance was for him a disheartening proof that his servant had not\r\nhitherto succeeded in discovering Edith’s whereabouts or in obtaining\r\nany certain news of her fate.\r\n\r\nWhat did it avail him, that after much thought he had already evolved a\r\nplan for her liberation, if there was no possibility of putting himself\r\nin communication with her!\r\n\r\nBelieving her to be kept prisoner in a harem tent, his idea was to send\r\nMorar Gopal with a letter to her, fully convinced that the wily Indian\r\nwould succeed by stratagem and bribery in reaching her. Before the\r\nbanquet he had negotiated with one of the Indian rajahs for the purchase\r\nof an ox-waggon, and if Edith could by his letter be prevailed upon to\r\nmake an attempt at flight, it would not in his view be very difficult\r\nto bring her under Morar Gopal’s protection to Ambala, where she would\r\nagain find herself among her English countrymen.\r\n\r\nBut this plan was unrealisable so long as he did not even know\r\nwhere Edith was. Incapable of bearing any longer this condition of\r\nuncertainty, he was just on the point of leaving the tent in order, at\r\nall risks, to hunt for the beloved lady, when a Russian dragoon stepped\r\nbehind his chair and informed him with a military salute that a lady\r\noutside the tent wished to speak to the Captain.\r\n\r\nFull of blissful hope that it was Edith he jumped up and hurried out.\r\nBut his longing eyes sought in vain for Captain Irwin’s widow. Instead\r\nof her whom he sought he perceived a tall female form in the short\r\njacket and short-cut coloured dress which he had seen on his journeys\r\namong the inhabitants of the Georgian mountains. The hair and the face\r\nof the girl were almost entirely hidden by a scarf wound round the head.\r\nOnly when, at his approach, she pushed it back somewhat he perceived who\r\nstood before him.\r\n\r\n“Georgi--you here!” he exclaimed with surprise. “And in this dress?”\r\n\r\nHe had indeed reason to be surprised, for he had not again seen the\r\nhandsome, blonde page, to whom he chiefly owed his life, since their\r\nmeeting on the way to the place of execution.\r\n\r\nWhen on the evening of that for him so eventful day he asked Prince\r\nTchajawadse about Georgi he had received only a short, evasive reply,\r\nand the Prince’s knitted brows showed such evident anger that he well\r\nperceived that something must have taken place between them, and so it\r\nappeared to him to be best to him not to mention again the name of the\r\nCircassian girl.\r\n\r\nWhen the detachment started he had in vain looked for the page who had\r\nhitherto been inseparable from “his master,” and only the anxiety for\r\nEdith, which was so much nearer his heart, was the cause that he had not\r\nthought much about the inexplicable disappearance of the disguised girl.\r\n\r\nHe had certainly least of all expected to find her here, so far from the\r\nRussian headquarters, and in woman’s dress to boot. But the Circassian\r\ndid not seem inclined to give him detailed information.\r\n\r\n“I have begged you to come out to see me, sir,” she said, “because I did\r\nnot want the Prince to see me. I met your Indian servant. And he told me\r\nabout the English lady whom the Maharajah of Chanidigot has carried off\r\nfrom you.”\r\n\r\n“He did not carry her off from me, Georgi, for I have no claim upon her.\r\nShe only placed herself under my protection, and therefore it is my duty\r\nto do all that I can to set her free.”\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at him, and there was a glance as of suppressed passion\r\nin her beautiful eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why do you not speak the truth, sir? Say that you love her! Tell\r\nme that you love her and I will bring her back to you--and this very\r\nevening.”\r\n\r\n“You, Georgi, how in all the world will you be able to manage that? Do\r\nyou know then where the lady is to be found?”\r\n\r\n“I know it from your servant, Morar Gopal. She is there, in that tent\r\nof the Maharajah of Chanidigot, before whose door the two Indians are\r\nstanding sentry. Take care and do not attempt to force your way in, for\r\nthe sentries would cut you to pieces before allowing you to put a foot\r\nin the tent.”\r\n\r\n“It may be that you are right,” said Heideck, whose breast was now\r\nfilled with a blissful feeling at having at last learned with certainty\r\nthat the adored woman was close by. “But how shall you be able to get to\r\nher?”\r\n\r\n“I am a woman, and I know how one must treat these miserable Indian\r\nrogues; the Maharajah of Chanidigot is ill, and in his pain he has\r\nsomething else to think of than of the joys of love. You must make use\r\nof this favourable moment, sir! and in this very night whatever is to\r\nhappen must happen.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly! every minute lost means perhaps a terrible danger to Mrs.\r\nIrwin. But if you have a plan for saving her please tell me--”\r\n\r\nThe Circassian shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Why talk of things that must be first accomplished? Return to the\r\nbanquet, sir, that no one may suspect of you. At midnight you will find\r\nthe English lady in your tent, or you will never set eyes on me again.”\r\n\r\nShe turned as if to go; but after having taken a few steps came back\r\nonce more to him.\r\n\r\n“You will not tell the Prince that I am here, do you understand? It is\r\nnot time yet for him to learn that.”\r\n\r\nWith these words she disappeared, before Heideck could ask another\r\nquestion. Little as he felt inclined after what he had just experienced\r\nto return to the mad riot of the banquet, he perceived that there\r\nwas scarcely anything else open to him, for any interference with the\r\nunknown plans of the Circassian would scarcely be of any advantage to\r\nEdith.\r\n\r\nBut if the minutes had hitherto appeared endless, they now crept on with\r\nquite intolerable slowness. He scarcely heard or saw anything that was\r\ntaking place about him. The rajah who had the next place to him tried in\r\nvain to open a conversation in his broken English, and at last, shaking\r\nhis head, abandoned the silent stranger to his musings, which in the\r\nmiddle of this riotous festivity must certainly have appeared very\r\nstrange to him.\r\n\r\nShortly before midnight, before Prince Tchajawadse and his other\r\ncomrades thought of moving, Heideck once more left the state tent of the\r\nMaharajah and turned his steps towards the Russian camp, which was far\r\naway visible in the red glare of the bivouac fires, around which the\r\nloudest merriment was also taking place.\r\n\r\nIn reality he entertained very little hope that the Circassian would\r\nbe able to fulfil her bold promise, for what she had taken upon herself\r\nappeared to him to be absolutely impracticable. Yet his heart throbbed\r\nwildly when he thrust back the linen sheet that covered the entrance of\r\nthe tent which had been assigned to him.\r\n\r\nOn the folding-table in the middle of the little room were two\r\nlighted candles beside a burning lantern. And in their light Heideck\r\ndiscerned--not Edith Irwin, but instead, the handsomest young rajah who\r\nhad ever crossed his eyes under the glowing skies of India.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Heideck was uncertain, for the slender youth, in the silken\r\nblouse tied round with a red scarf, English riding-breeches and neat\r\nlittle boots, had turned his back to him, so that he could not see\r\nhis face, and his hair was completely hidden under the rose-and-yellow\r\nstriped turban. But the blissful presentiment which told him who was\r\nconcealed beneath the charming disguise could not deceive him. A few\r\nrapid steps and he was by the side of the delicate-limbed Indian youth.\r\nOverpowered by a storm of passionate emotions, he forgot all obstacles\r\nand scruples, and the next moment clasped him in his arms with an\r\nexultant cry of joy.\r\n\r\n“Edith! my Edith!”\r\n\r\n“My beloved friend!”\r\n\r\nIn the exceeding delight of this reunion the confession which had never\r\npassed her lips in the hours of familiar tete-a-tete, or in the moments\r\nof extreme peril which they had endured together, forced its way\r\nirresistibly from her heart--the confession of a love which had long\r\nabsorbed her whole life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nEDITH’S ADVENTURES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before the two lovers were sufficiently composed to\r\nexplain to each other fully the almost fabulous events that had lately\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nHeideck, of course, wanted to know, first of all, how Edith had\r\ncontrived to escape without making a disturbance and calling for the aid\r\nof those about her. What she told him was the most touching proof of her\r\naffection for him. The Maharajah’s creatures must have heard, somehow or\r\nother, of Heideck’s imprisonment and condemnation, and they had reckoned\r\ncorrectly on Edith’s attachment to the man who had saved her life.\r\n\r\nShe had been told that a single word from the Maharajah would be\r\nsufficient to destroy the foolhardy German, and that her only hope\r\nof saving him from death lay in a personal appeal to His Highness’s\r\nclemency. Although she knew perfectly well the shameful purpose this\r\nsuggestion concealed, she had not hesitated, in her anxiety for her\r\ndear one’s safety, to follow the men who promised to conduct her to the\r\nMaharajah, full of hypocritical assurances that she would come to no\r\nharm. She had had so many proofs of the revengeful cruelty of this\r\nIndian despot that she feared the worst for Heideck, and resolved, in\r\nthe last extremity, to sacrifice her life--if she could not preserve her\r\nhonour--to save him.\r\n\r\nThe Maharajah had received her with great courtesy and promised to use\r\nhis influence in favour of the German who had been seized as a spy and\r\ntraitor by the Russians. But he had at the same time thrown out fairly\r\nbroad hints what his price would be, and, from the moment she had\r\ndelivered herself into his hands, he had treated her as a prisoner,\r\nalthough with great respect. All communication, except with persons of\r\nthe Maharajah’s household, was completely cut off; and she was under no\r\ndelusion as to the lot which awaited her, as soon as the Prince again\r\nfelt himself completely secure in some mountain fastness unaffected by\r\nthe events of the war.\r\n\r\nFeeling certain of this, she had continually contemplated the idea of\r\nflight; but the fear of sealing the fate of her unhappy friend, even\r\nmore than the ever-watchful suspicion of her guards, had prevented her\r\nfrom making the attempt.\r\n\r\nHer joy had been all the greater when, the same evening, Morar Gopal\r\nappeared in the women’s tent with the Circassian, to relieve her from\r\nthe almost unendurable tortures of uncertainty as to Heideck’s fate.\r\n\r\nThe cunning Hindu had managed to gain access to the carefully guarded\r\nprisoners for himself and his companion by pretending that the Maharajah\r\nhad chosen the Circassian girl to be the English lady’s servant. He had\r\nwhispered a few words to Edith, telling her what was necessary for her\r\nto know for the moment.\r\n\r\nAfter he had retired, it roused no suspicion when she asked to be left\r\nalone for a few moments with the new servant. With her assistance, she\r\nmade use of the opportunity to put on the light Indian man’s clothes\r\nwhich the Circassian had brought with her in a parcel. The guards, who\r\nwere by this time intoxicated, had allowed the slender young rajah, into\r\nwhom she had transformed herself, to depart unmolested, and Morar\r\nGopal, who was waiting for her at a place agreed upon close at hand,\r\nhad conducted her to Heideck’s tent, where she might, for the moment at\r\nleast, consider herself to be safe.\r\n\r\n“But Georgi?” asked the Captain with some anxiety. “She remained in the\r\nwomen’s tent? What will happen to her when her share in your flight is\r\ndiscovered?”\r\n\r\n“The idea also tormented me. But the heroic girl repeatedly assured me\r\nthat she would find a way to escape, and that in any case she would have\r\nnothing to fear, as soon as she appealed to Prince Tchajawadse.”\r\n\r\n“That may be so; but that hardly agrees with her wish to keep the\r\nfact of her presence in the camp a secret from the Prince. The girl’s\r\nbehaviour is a complete riddle to me. I do not understand what can have\r\ninduced her to sacrifice herself with such wonderful unselfishness\r\nfor us, who are really only strangers to her, in whom she can feel no\r\ninterest. Certainly she was not actuated by any thought of a reward. She\r\nhas the pride of her race, and I am certain that she would consider any\r\noffer of one as an insult.”\r\n\r\n“I think the same. But perhaps I can guess her real motives.”\r\n\r\n“And won’t you tell me what you think?”\r\n\r\nEdith hesitated a little; but she was not one of those women who allow\r\nany petty emotion to master them.\r\n\r\n“I think, my friend, that she loves you,” she said, with a slight,\r\nenchanting smile. “Some unguarded expressions and the fire that kindled\r\nin her eyes as soon as we mentioned your name, made me feel almost\r\ncertain of it. The fact that, notwithstanding, she helped to set me\r\nfree, is certainly, in the circumstances, only a stronger proof of her\r\nmagnanimity. But I understand it perfectly. A woman in love, if of noble\r\ncharacter, is capable of any act of self-denial.”\r\n\r\nHeideck shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I think your shrewdness has played you false on this occasion. I am\r\nfirmly convinced that she is Prince Tchajawadse’s mistress, and, from\r\nall I have seen of their relations, it seems to me inconceivable that\r\nshe would be unfaithful to him for the sake of a stranger, with whom she\r\nhas only interchanged a few casual words.”\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps we may have an opportunity of settling whether I am wrong\r\nor not. But now, my friend, I should first of all like to know what you\r\nhave decided about me.”\r\n\r\nHeideck was in some embarrassment how to answer, and spoke hesitatingly\r\nof his intention to send her to Ambala with Morar Gopal. But Edith would\r\nnot allow him to finish. She interrupted him with a decided gesture of\r\ndissent.\r\n\r\n“Ask of me what you like--except to leave you again. What shall I do\r\nin Ambala without you? I have suffered so unutterably since you were\r\ncarried off before my eyes at Anar Kali, that I will die a thousand\r\ntimes rather than again expose myself to the torture of such\r\nuncertainty.”\r\n\r\nA noise behind him made Heideck turn his head. He saw the curtain before\r\nthe door of the tent slightly lifted, and that it was Morar Gopal who\r\nhad attempted to draw his attention by coughing discreetly.\r\n\r\nHe called to the loyal fellow to come in, and thanked him, not\r\ncondescendingly, as a master recognises the cleverness of his servant,\r\nbut as one friend thanks another.\r\n\r\nThe Hindu’s features showed how delighted he was by the kindness of\r\nhis idolised master, although there was no alteration in his humble and\r\nmodest demeanour even for a moment. As respectful as ever, he said: “I\r\nbring good news, sahib. One of the Maharajah’s retinue, whose tongue\r\nI loosened with some of your rupees, has told me that the Maharajah of\r\nSabathu is going to give the Russians forty horsemen to show them the\r\nbest roads to Simla. The country here is under his rule, and his people\r\nknow every inch of ground to the top of the mountains. If the lady joins\r\nthese horsemen to-morrow in the dress of a rajah, she will be sure to\r\nget away from here unmolested.”\r\n\r\nThe excellence and practicability of this plan was obvious, and Heideck\r\nagain recognised what a treasure a lucky accident had bestowed upon him\r\nin the shape of this Indian boy. Edith also agreed, since she saw how\r\njoyfully Heideck welcomed the proposal, although the prospect of being\r\nobliged to show herself in broad daylight before everybody in man’s\r\ndress was painful to her feelings as a woman.\r\n\r\nShe asked Morar Gopal whether he had heard anything of Georgi in the\r\nmeantime. He nodded assent.\r\n\r\n“I was talking to her half an hour ago. She had escaped from the women’s\r\ntent and was on the point of leaving the camp.”\r\n\r\n“What?” cried Heideck. “Where in the world did she intend to go?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, sahib. She was very sad, but when I asked her to\r\naccompany me to the sahib, she said she did not want to see him and\r\nthe lady again; she sent her respects to the sahib, and begged him to\r\nremember his promise that he would say nothing to Prince Tchajawadse of\r\nher having been here.”\r\n\r\nHeideck and Edith exchanged a significant look. This singular girl’s\r\nbehaviour set them riddles which for the moment they were unable to\r\nsolve. But it was only natural and human that in their own affairs they\r\nvery soon forgot the Circassian.\r\n\r\nEdith had to consent to Heideck leaving his tent at her disposal for the\r\nrest of the night, while he himself spent the few hours before daybreak\r\nat one of the bivouac fires. But Morar Gopal was to take up his quarters\r\nbefore the entrance to the tent, and Heideck felt confident that he\r\ncould not entrust his valuable treasure to a more loyal keeper.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nFortune, which had reunited the lovers in so wonderful a manner, still\r\ncontinued favourable to them. Very early on the following day, Heideck\r\nhad purchased a neat little bay horse, already saddled and bridled, for\r\nEdith’s use. When the troop of Indian horsemen, who were to serve as\r\nguides and spies for the Russians, started on their way, the boyish\r\nyoung rajah joined them, and no one made his strange appearance the\r\nsubject of obtrusive questions. The Indians probably at first thought\r\nhe was a very youthful Russian officer, who wore the native dress\r\nfor special reasons, and on that account preserved a most respectful\r\ndemeanour. Tchajawadse, who accidentally found himself close to Edith\r\nbefore starting, said nothing, although he certainly looked keenly at\r\nher for a moment.\r\n\r\nThe bad reports of the health of the Maharajah of Chanidigot, which\r\nspread through the camp, were sufficient explanation why he made no\r\nattempt to regain possession of the beautiful fugitive. He was said to\r\nbe suffering from such violent pain and fever, caused by his wounds,\r\nthat he had practically lost all interest in the outside world.\r\n\r\nHaving taken a hearty leave of their Indian hosts, the Russian\r\ndetachment advanced further into the hilly country, and at noon spies\r\nreported to Prince Tchajawadse that the English had completely evacuated\r\nAmbala and had set out on the march to Delhi. Probably the strength of\r\nthe Russian division, whose advance had been reported, had been greatly\r\nexaggerated at Ambala, and the English had preferred to avoid a probably\r\nhopeless engagement.\r\n\r\nWith a woman’s cleverness, Edith managed, without attracting\r\nobservation, to keep near Heideck, so that they often had the\r\nopportunity of conversing. Her tender, fair skin must have appeared\r\nstriking amongst all the brown faces, but the will and caprice of\r\nRussian officers demanded respect, and so no one appeared to know that\r\nthere was an English lady in the troop wearing the costume of a rajah.\r\nBesides, the march was not a long one. The hunting-camp was only about\r\n150 miles from Simla, situated below Kalka. On the next morning the\r\ncolumn arrived before Simla and found that Jutogh, the high-lying\r\nBritish cantonment to the west of the far-extended hill city, had been\r\nevacuated.\r\n\r\nPrince Tchajawadse quartered his infantry and artillery in the English\r\nbarracks, and marched with the horsemen into the crescent-shaped bazaar,\r\nthe town proper, surrounded by numerous villas, scattered over the hills\r\nand in the midst of pleasure-gardens. He at once sent off patrols\r\nof officers to the town hall, the offices of the Government and\r\nCommander-in-Chief, while he himself made his way to Government House, a\r\nbeautiful palace on Observatory Hill.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was spring, Simla still lay in its winter sleep. It had been\r\ndeserted by the lively, brilliant society which, when the intolerable,\r\nmoist heat of summer drove the Viceroy from Calcutta, enlivened the\r\nmagnificent valleys and heights with its horses and carriages, its\r\ngames, parties, and elegant dresses. Only the resident population, and\r\nthe servants who had been left to look after the buildings and keep them\r\nin good order, remained, English Society being kept away by the war.\r\n\r\nThe hills were about a mile and three-quarters above the level of the\r\nIndian Ocean, and frequent showers of rain made the climate so raw that\r\nHeideck rode with his cloak on, and Edith flung a dragoon’s long cloak\r\nover her shoulders to protect herself against the cold.\r\n\r\nThe officers were commissioned to search the Government buildings for\r\nimportant legal documents and papers, which the English Government might\r\nhave left behind in Simla, and which were of importance to the Russian\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nHeideck had to examine the seven handsome blocks of Government offices,\r\nespecially the buildings set apart for the Commander-in-Chief, the\r\nQuartermaster-General, the general railway management, and the post and\r\ntelegraph offices.\r\n\r\nHe found none but subordinate officials anywhere until he came to the\r\noffice of the Judge Advocate General. Here he found a dignified\r\nold gentleman, sitting so quietly in his armchair that Heideck was\r\ninvoluntarily reminded of Archimedes when the Roman soldiers surprised\r\nhim at his calculations.\r\n\r\nAs the officer entered, accompanied by the soldiers, the old gentleman\r\nlooked at them keenly out of his large, yellowish eyes. But he neither\r\nasked what they wanted, nor even attempted to prevent their entrance.\r\nHeideck bowed politely, and apologised for the intrusion necessitated\r\nby his duty. This courteous behaviour appeared to surprise the old\r\ngentleman, who returned his greeting, and said that there was nothing\r\nleft for him but to submit to the orders of the conqueror.\r\n\r\n“As there seems nothing to be found in these rooms but legal books and\r\ndocuments,” said Heideck, “I need not make any investigation, for we are\r\nsimply concerned with military matters. I should be glad if I could\r\nmeet any personal wishes of yours, for I do not think I am mistaken in\r\nassuming that I have the honour of speaking to a higher official, whom\r\nspecial reasons have obliged to remain in Simla.”\r\n\r\n“As a matter of fact, my physicians were of opinion that it would be\r\nbeneficial to my health to spend the winter in the mountains. You\r\ncan imagine how greatly I regret that I took their advice--I am\r\nJudge-Advocate-General Kennedy.”\r\n\r\n“Is your family also in Simla?” asked Heideck.\r\n\r\n“My wife and daughter are here.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, there is an English lady with our column, the widow of an officer\r\nwho was killed at Lahore. Would you be disposed to let her join your\r\nfamily?”\r\n\r\n“An English lady?”\r\n\r\n“She is the victim of a series of adventurous experiences, as to which\r\nshe can best inform you herself. Her name is Mrs. Irwin. Would you be\r\ndisposed to grant her your protection? If so, I should certainly be the\r\nbearer of welcome news to her.”\r\n\r\n“My protection?” repeated the old gentleman in surprise. “My family\r\nand I need protection ourselves, and how can we, in the present\r\ncircumstances, undertake such a responsibility?”\r\n\r\n“You and your family have nothing to fear from us, sir. On the contrary,\r\nwe intend to maintain quietness and order.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, your behaviour is that of a gentleman, and if the lady\r\nwishes to come to us we will offer no objection. Can I speak to her,\r\nthat we may come to an understanding?”\r\n\r\n“I will make haste and fetch her.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, he did not hesitate for a moment. As he expected, Edith was\r\nvery grateful to him for his friendly proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy was extremely astonished to see a young rajah enter the\r\nroom, and did not seem quite agreeably impressed by the masquerade.\r\n\r\n“Is this the lady of whom you spoke?” he asked in surprise. But his\r\nserious face visibly cleared when Edith said, in her sweet, gentle\r\nvoice--\r\n\r\n“A countrywoman, who owes her life to this gentleman here, and who has\r\nonly escaped death and dishonour by the aid of this disguise.”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Irwin, if you decide to join Mrs. Kennedy,” said Heideck, “I will\r\nsend your belongings to Mr. Kennedy’s house. I must now leave you for\r\nthe present. I have other official duties to perform, but I will return\r\nlater.”\r\n\r\n“In any case I am glad to welcome my countrywoman,” protested the old\r\ngentleman. “You can see my house from the window here, and I beg you\r\nwill call upon me when your duties are over.”\r\n\r\nIt was not till after sunset that Heideck called at Mr. Kennedy’s house.\r\nHe stood for a moment at the garden-gate and saw the snow-clad heights\r\nglowing in the fire of the evening light. Long chains of blue hills rose\r\nhigher and higher towards the north, till at last the highest range on\r\nthe distant horizon, bristling with eternal glaciers, mounted towards\r\nthe sky in wondrous brilliancy.\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy lived in a very imposing villa. Heideck was received with\r\nsuch friendliness by the master of the house and the ladies that he\r\nrecognised only too clearly that Edith must have spoken warmly in his\r\nfavour. She must also certainly have told them that he was a German. She\r\nwas dressed as a woman again, and had already won the hearts of all by\r\nher frankness. Mrs. Kennedy was a matron with fine, pleasant features,\r\nand evidently of high social standing. Her daughter, about the same age\r\nas Edith, appeared to have taken a great fancy to the visitor.\r\n\r\nHeideck sat with the family by the fire, and all tried to forget that he\r\nwore the uniform of the enemy.\r\n\r\n“I wish we could manage to leave India and get back to England,” said\r\nMrs. Kennedy. “My husband wants to remain in Calcutta to perform his\r\nduties, but he cannot stand the climate. Besides, how could we get\r\nto Calcutta? Our only chance would be to obtain a Russian passport,\r\nenabling us to travel without interference.”\r\n\r\n“My dearest Beatrice,” objected her husband. “I know that you,\r\nlike myself, no longer care what happens to us, at a time when such\r\nmisfortune has overtaken our country. Amidst the general misfortune,\r\nwhat matters our own fate?”\r\n\r\n“I should think,” interposed Heideck politely, “that the individual,\r\nhowever deeply he feels the general misfortune, ought not to give way\r\nto despair, but should always be thinking of his family as in time of\r\npeace.”\r\n\r\n“No!” cried Mr. Kennedy. “An Englishmen cannot understand this\r\ninternational wisdom. A German’s character is different; he can easily\r\nchange his country, the Englishman cannot. But you must excuse me,” he\r\ncontinued, recollecting himself. “You wounded my national honour, and I\r\nforgot the situation in which we are. Of course, I had no intention of\r\ninsulting you.”\r\n\r\n“There is some truth in what you say,” replied Heideck, seriously,\r\n“but allow me to explain. Our German fatherland, in past centuries, was\r\nalways the theatre of the battles of all the peoples of Europe. At that\r\ntime few of the German princes were conscious of any German national\r\nfeeling; they were the representatives of narrow-minded dynastic\r\ninterests. Thus our German people grew up without the consciousness of\r\na great and common fatherland. Our German self-consciousness is no older\r\nthan Bismarck. But we have become large-hearted, generous-minded, by\r\nhaving had to submit to foreign peoples and customs. Our religious\r\nfeeling and our patriotism are of wider scope than those of others.\r\nHence, I believe that, now that we have been for a generation occupied\r\nwith our material strength and are politically united, our universal\r\nculture summons us to undertake the further development of civilisation,\r\nwhich hitherto has been chiefly indebted to the French and English.”\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman did not answer at once. He sat immersed in thought,\r\nand a considerable time elapsed before he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Anyone can keep raising the standpoint of his view of things. It is\r\nlike ascending the mountains there. From each higher range the view\r\nbecomes more comprehensive, while the details of the panorama gradually\r\ndisappear. Naturally, to one looking down from so lofty a standpoint,\r\nall political interests shrivel up to insignificant nothings, and then\r\npatriotism no longer exists. But I think that we are first of all bound\r\nto work in the sphere in which we have once been placed. A man who\r\nneglects his wife and children in the desire to benefit the world by his\r\nideas, neglects the narrowest sphere of his duties. But in that case the\r\nwelfare of his own people, of his own state, must be for every man the\r\nhighest objects of his efforts; then only, starting from his own nation,\r\nmay his wishes have a higher aim. I cannot respect anyone who abandons\r\nthe soil of patriotism in order to waste his time on visionary schemes\r\nin the domain of politics, to wax enthusiastic over universal peace and\r\nto call all men brothers.”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said Edith, “this is the doctrine of Christianity.”\r\n\r\n“Of theoretical, not practical Christianity,” eagerly rejoined the\r\nEnglishman. “I esteem the old Roman Cato, who took his life when he saw\r\nhis country’s freedom disappearing, and England would never have grown\r\ngreat had not many of her sons been Catos.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Kennedy, you are proclaiming the old Greek idea of the state,” said\r\nHeideck. “But I do not believe that the old Greeks had such a\r\nconception of the state as modern professors assert, and as ancient Rome\r\npractically carried out. Professors are in the habit of quoting Plato,\r\nbut Plato was too highly gifted not to understand that the state after\r\nall consists merely of men. Plato regarded the state not as an idol\r\non whose altar the citizen was obliged to sacrifice himself, but as an\r\neducational institution. He says that really virtuous citizens could\r\nonly be reared by an intelligently organised state, and for this reason\r\nhe attached such importance to the state. A state is in its origin only\r\nthe outer form, which the inner life of the nation has naturally created\r\nfor itself, and this conception should not be upset. The state should\r\neducate the masses, in order that not only justice, but also external\r\nand internal prosperity may be realised. The Romans certainly do not\r\nappear to have made the rearing of capable citizens, in accordance with\r\nPlato’s idea, the aim of the state; they were modern, like the great\r\nPowers of to-day, whose aim it is to grow as rich and powerful as\r\npossible. We Germans also desire this, and that is why we are waging\r\nthis war; but at the same time I assert that something higher dwells in\r\nthe German national character--the idea of humanity. With us also our\r\nideals are being destroyed, and therefore we are fighting for our ‘place\r\nunder the sun,’ in order to protect and secure our ideals together with\r\nour national greatness.”\r\n\r\nAt this point a servant entered and announced dinner.\r\n\r\nAt table the conversation shifted from philosophy and politics to art.\r\nThe ladies tried to cheer the old gentleman and banish his despair.\r\nElizabeth talked of the concerts in Simla and Calcutta, mentioning the\r\ngreat technical difficulties which beset music in India, owing to the\r\ninstruments being so soon injured by the climate. The moist air of the\r\ntowns on the coast made the wood swell; the dry air of Central India, on\r\nthe other hand, made it shrink, which was very injurious to pianos, but\r\nespecially to violins and cellos. Pianos, with metal instead of wood\r\ninside, were made for the tropics; but they had a shrill tone and were\r\nequally affected by abrupt changes of temperature.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Elizabeth seated herself at the piano, and it did Heideck\r\ngood to find that Edith had a pleasant and well-trained alto voice. She\r\nsang some melancholy English and Scotch songs.\r\n\r\n“I have never sung since I left England,” she said, greatly moved.\r\n\r\nHeideck had listened to the music with rapture. After the fearful scenes\r\nof recent times the melodies affected him so deeply that his eyes filled\r\nwith tears. It was not only the music that affected him, but Edith’s\r\nsoul, which spoke through it.\r\n\r\n“What are you thinking of doing, Mr. Kennedy?” he asked the old\r\ngentleman. “Shall you remain in Simla and keep Mrs. Irwin with you?”\r\n\r\n“I have thought it over,” he replied. “I shall not stay here. I shall go\r\nto Calcutta, if I can. It is my duty to be at my post there.”\r\n\r\n“But how do you intend to travel? The railways still in existence have\r\nbeen seized for the exclusive use of the army. Remember that you would\r\nhave to pass both armies, the Russian and the English. You would have to\r\ngo from Kalka to Ambala, and thence to Delhi.”\r\n\r\n“If I could get a passport, I could travel post to Delhi, where I should\r\nbe with the English army. Can you get me a passport?”\r\n\r\n“I will try. Possibly Prince Tchajawadse may be persuaded to let me have\r\none. I will point out to him that you are civilian officials.”\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nPrince Tchajawadse most emphatically refused to make out the passport\r\nfor Mr. Kennedy and his family.\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry, my friend,” said he, “but it is simply impossible. The\r\nJudge-Advocate-General is a very high official; I cannot allow him to go\r\nto the English headquarters and give information as to what is going on\r\nhere. The authorities would justly put a very bad construction upon\r\nsuch ill-timed amiability, and I should not like to obliterate the good\r\nimpression which the success of the expedition to Simla has made upon my\r\nsuperiors by an unpardonable act of folly on my own part.”\r\n\r\nHeideck saw that any attempt at persuasion would be useless in the face\r\nof the Prince’s determination. He therefore acquainted Mr. Kennedy with\r\nthe failure of his efforts, at the same expressing his sincere regret.\r\n\r\n“Then I shall try to return to England,” said the old gentleman, with a\r\nsigh. “Please ask the Prince if he has any objection to my making my way\r\nby the shortest road to Karachi? Perhaps he will let me have a passport\r\nfor this route.”\r\n\r\nPrince Tchajawadse was quite ready to accede to this request.\r\n\r\n“The ladies and gentlemen can travel where they please in the rear of\r\nthe Russian army, for all I care,” he declared. “There is not the least\r\noccasion for me to treat the worthy old gentleman as a prisoner.”\r\n\r\nOn the same day Heideck had a serious conversation with Edith about her\r\nimmediate future. He inquired what her wishes and plans were, but she\r\nclung to him tenderly and whispered, “My only wish is to stay with you,\r\nmy only plan is to make you happy.”\r\n\r\nKissing her tender lips, which could utter such entrancing words, he\r\nsaid, deeply moved: “Well, then, I propose that we travel together to\r\nKarachi. I am resolved to quit the Russian service and endeavour to\r\nreturn to Germany. But could you induce yourself to follow me to my\r\ncountry, the land of your present enemies?”\r\n\r\n“My home is with you. Suppose that we were to make a home here in Simla,\r\nI should be ready, and only too glad to live here for the rest of my\r\nlife. Take me to Germany or Siberia, and I will follow you--it is all\r\nthe same to me, if only I am not obliged to leave you.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Heideck was pained to think that she had no word of\r\nattachment for her country; but he had already learnt not to measure\r\nher by the standard of the other women whom he had hitherto met on his\r\nlife’s journey, and it ill became him to reproach her for this want of\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Kennedy has assured me that he is ready to take you under his\r\nprotection during the journey,” said he. “I will speak to the Prince\r\nagain to-day, and, as he has no right to detain me, it will be possible\r\nfor me, as I confidently hope, to start with you for Karachi.”\r\n\r\n“But I shall only accept the Kennedys’ offer if you go with us,”\r\n declared Edith in a tone of decision, which left no doubt as to her\r\nunshakable resolution.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Prince Tchajawadse put no difficulties in his way.\r\n\r\n“I sincerely regret to lose you again so soon,” he declared, “but it\r\nis for you alone to decide whether you go or stay. It was arranged\r\nbeforehand that you could leave the Russian service as soon as it became\r\nworth your while. Women are, after all, the controlling spirits of our\r\nlives.”\r\n\r\nOf course the Prince had long since been aware that the Kennedys’\r\nvisitor was Edith Irwin, but this was the first time he had alluded to\r\nhis German friend’s love affair.\r\n\r\nAs if he felt bound to defend himself against a humiliating reproach,\r\nHeideck hastened to reply.\r\n\r\n“You misunderstand my motives. It is my duty as a soldier which summons\r\nme first of all. Hitherto I have had no prospect of getting a passage\r\non an English steamer. But, in the company of Mr. Kennedy, and on his\r\nrecommendation, I have hopes that it will not be refused me.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me. I never for a moment doubted your patriotic sense of\r\nduty, and I wish you from my heart a happy voyage home. Of course,\r\nnotwithstanding the alliance of our nations, it is not the same to you,\r\nwhether you fight in the ranks of the Russian or the German army. And if\r\nthe prospect of travelling in such pleasant society has finally decided\r\nyou, you have, in my opinion, no reason at all to be ashamed of it.\r\nCertainly, for my own part, I am convinced that it is better, for\r\na soldier to make the female element play as subordinate a role as\r\npossible in his life. He ought to do like most of my countrymen, and get\r\na wife who will not resent being thrashed, with or without cause. It may\r\nbe that I am mistaken on this point, and I have been severely punished\r\nfor it.”\r\n\r\nHis countenance had suddenly become very grave, and as he could only be\r\nalluding to his lost page, Heideck thought he might at last venture to\r\nask a question as to the whereabouts of the Circassian.\r\n\r\nBut the Prince shook his head deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n“Do not ask me about her. It is a painful story, which I do not care to\r\nmention, since it recalls one of the worst hours of my life. It is bad\r\nenough that we poor, weak creatures cannot atone for the mistakes of a\r\nmoment.”\r\n\r\nThen, as if desirous of summarily cutting short an inconvenient\r\ndiscussion, he returned to the original subject of conversation.\r\n\r\n“From my point of view, for purely practical reasons I must regard it\r\nas a mistake that you should so soon give up your career in the Russian\r\narmy, which has begun under the most favourable auspices. A brilliant\r\ncareer is open to capable men of your stamp amongst us, for there is\r\nmore elbow-room in our army than in yours. But I know that it is useless\r\nto say anything further about it. One word more! You need not at once\r\ntake off the uniform to which you do honour before you leave Simla.\r\nTo-morrow I am returning to Lahore, and during the march I beg you will\r\nstill remain at the head of your squadron. It will be safest for your\r\nEnglish friends to travel with our column. At Lahore you can do as\r\nyou please. Since the course of the campaign is in a south-easterly\r\ndirection, the west is free, and you may possibly be able to travel by\r\ntrain for a considerable portion of the journey to Karachi.”\r\n\r\nIn this proposal Heideck recognised a fresh proof of the friendly\r\ndisposition which the Prince had already so often shown towards him, and\r\nhe was not slow to thank him most heartily.\r\n\r\nThe idea of being obliged to travel under the enemy’s protection was, of\r\ncourse, not a very pleasant one to Mr. Kennedy; but in the interests\r\nof the females who accompanied him he was bound to acquiesce in the\r\narrangement, since there was really no better chance of reaching Karachi\r\nquickly and safely.\r\n\r\n“You cannot imagine,” he said to Heideck, “how hard it is for me to\r\nleave India, so dearly purchased. I have devoted twenty years of my life\r\nto it, years of hard, unremitting toil. And now my work, like that of so\r\nmany better men, is rendered useless at a single stroke.”\r\n\r\n“You have spent two whole decades in India without a break?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I could not make up my mind to accompany my wife and daughter on\r\ntheir occasional visits to Europe for a few months’ relaxation. I was\r\npassionately fond of my work, and I can hardly get over the idea that\r\nall is lost. And it IS lost; I am under no illusion as to that. After\r\nthe Russians have once set foot here, they will never give up the\r\ncountry again. Their rule will be more firmly established than ours,\r\nsince they are at heart much closer to the Indians than we are.”\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nOn the following day they set out.\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy and the ladies rode in a mail-coach drawn by four Australian\r\nhorses, which had been originally intended for driving to the Anandale\r\nraces. He had brought with him his own English coachman, an English\r\nservant, and an English maid; he had paid off and discharged his\r\nnumerous Indian servants before starting.\r\n\r\nThe march proceeded by way of Kalka, the last station on the railway to\r\nSimla, without any incidents, as far as Lahore. Here Prince Tchajawadse\r\nwas informed that the Russian army had started on the previous day\r\nfor Delhi, and that he was to follow as rapidly as possible with his\r\ndetachment.\r\n\r\nDuring the entry into the streets of Lahore, the sight of which awoke in\r\nhim so many painful recollections, Heideck was suddenly roused from his\r\nreverie. Behind the pillars supporting the balcony of a house he thought\r\nhe caught sight of the form of a woman, who followed with staring eyes\r\nthe march of the glittering, rattling troop of horsemen with their\r\nclattering swords. Although her face was almost entirely hidden by\r\na veil, he felt instinctively that she was no other than his own and\r\nEdith’s preserver--the page Georgi. He turned his horse and rode up to\r\nthe house. But the vision disappeared as he drew near, as if the earth\r\nhad swallowed it up. He accordingly was driven to assume that it was\r\nmerely a delusion of his senses.\r\n\r\nHe took leave of Prince Tchajawadse with a heartiness corresponding to\r\ntheir previous relations. The Prince embraced him several times, and his\r\neyes were moist as he again wished his comrade a prosperous journey\r\nand the laurels of a victorious warrior. Nor was Heideck ashamed of his\r\nemotion, when he clasped the Prince’s hand for the last time.\r\n\r\n“If you see your page again, please give him my own and Mrs. Irwin’s\r\nfarewell greeting.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince’s face clouded over.\r\n\r\n“I would do it with all my heart, my friend, but I shall never see my\r\npage again. Let us speak of him no more. There are wounds of which a man\r\ncannot feel proud.”\r\n\r\nWith this they parted.\r\n\r\nHeideck, who had resumed his civilian attire, slept at the hotel, and\r\nthen took the place Mr. Kennedy offered him in his carriage. He had\r\nfound out that the railway between Lahore and Mooltan from Montgomery\r\nStation was still available for travelling.\r\n\r\nThe English, with their peculiar tenacity, still continued the regular\r\nservice in the parts of India that were not affected by the war. The\r\nenormous extent of the country confined the struggle between the two\r\narmies in some degree to a strictly limited area. In the west, the east,\r\nand the interior of India there were few traces of the conflict. Only\r\nthe troop trains between Bombay and Calcutta revealed a state of war.\r\n\r\nSince the retirement of the English army from Lahore, no more troops\r\nwere to be seen on the western railway, and this section was again\r\nperfectly free for ordinary traffic.\r\n\r\nEven the Indian population of this district showed no particular signs\r\nof excitement. Only the actual presence of the Russian troops had\r\ndisturbed the patient and peaceful people. The travellers even passed\r\nthrough Chanidigot without any interruption of their occupations or\r\nmeeting with any unexpected delay.\r\n\r\nThe weather was not too hot; the stormy season had begun, and travelling\r\nin the roomy, comfortable railway carriages would have been in other\r\ncircumstances a real pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe travellers safely reached Karachi, the seaport town on the mouths\r\nof the Indus with its numerous tributaries, where Mr. Kennedy’s high\r\nposition procured them admission to the select Sind Club, where the\r\nattendance and lodging were all that could be desired. The club was\r\nalmost entirely deserted by its regular visitors, since, in addition to\r\nthe officers, all officials who could be dispensed with had joined the\r\narmy. But neither the Kennedys nor Edith and Heideck had any taste for\r\ninteresting society. Their only wish was to leave the country as soon\r\nas possible, and to see the end of the present painful condition of\r\naffairs. As the result of inquiries at the shipping agency, they had\r\ndecided to travel to Bombay by one of the steamers of the British India\r\nCompany, and to proceed thence to Europe by the Caledonia, the best\r\nvessel belonging to the P. and O. line.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, before going on board, Heideck hired a comfortable\r\nlittle one-horsed carriage and drove to Napier mole, where an elegant\r\nsailing-boat, manned by four lascars, was placed at their disposal at\r\nthe Sind Club boathouse. They sailed through the harbour protected by\r\nthree powerful forts, past Manora Point, the furthest extremity of the\r\nfortified mole, into the Arabian Sea.\r\n\r\n“Really, it is hard to leave this wonderful land,” said Heideck\r\nseriously. “It is hard to take leave for ever of this brilliant sun,\r\nthis glittering sea, and these mighty works of men’s hands, which have\r\nintroduced luxury and the comforts of a refined civilisation into a\r\nnatural paradise. I have never understood Mr. Kennedy’s sorrow better\r\nthan at this moment. And I can sympathise with the feeling of bitterness\r\nwhich makes him shut himself up in his room, to avoid the further sight\r\nof all this enchanting and splendid magnificence.”\r\n\r\nEdith, clinging to his arm and looking up fondly into his face only\r\nanswered, “I only see the world as it is reflected in your eyes. And\r\nthere its beauty is always the same to me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nTHE ETHICS OF ESPIONAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe steamer from Karachi to Bombay had about twenty officers and a\r\nlarger number of noncommissioned officers and men on board who had been\r\nwounded in the first engagements on the frontier. The sight of them was\r\nnot calculated to relieve the gloomy feelings of the English travellers,\r\nalthough during the three days of the voyage the weather was magnificent\r\nas they proceeded through the bright, blue sea along the west coast of\r\nIndia, so lavishly supplied with the beauties of Nature.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Bombay, one of the most beautiful in the world, presented\r\na singularly altered appearance to those who had seen it on previous\r\nvisits. There was a complete absence of the French, German, and Russian\r\nmerchantmen, which usually lay at anchor in considerable numbers;\r\nbesides English steamers there were only a few Italian and Austrian\r\nvessels in the roadstead.\r\n\r\nThe steamer from Karachi cast anchor not far from the Austrian Lloyd\r\nsteamer Imperatrix, from Trieste, and the passengers were taken from the\r\nApollo Bandar in small boats to the landing-stage.\r\n\r\nHeideck took up his quarters with his new English friends at the\r\nEsplanade Hotel. The admirably conducted house was well known to him,\r\nsince he had stayed there a few days on his arrival in India. But the\r\nappearance of the hotel had altered during the interval as completely as\r\nthat of the European quarter of the city, from which all life seemed to\r\nhave disappeared. The ravages of the plague might have had something to\r\ndo with it, but the main cause was the war, which made its presence felt\r\nin the absence of various elements of life which at other times were\r\nespecially remarkable.\r\n\r\nFormerly the meeting-place of fashionable society, nearly all its guests\r\nat the present time were connected with the army; the few ladies were in\r\nmourning, and an oppressive silence prevailed during meals.\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy, immediately on his arrival, had paid a visit to the\r\nGovernor in Heideck’s interest and returned with good news. He\r\nhad obtained permission for the young German to leave India by the\r\nCaledonia, which was starting in a few days with a considerable number\r\nof sick and wounded officers. The route to be taken was the usual one by\r\nAden and Port Said. Those passengers who intended to travel further by\r\nthe railway would be landed at Brindisi, the destination of the steamer\r\nbeing Southampton.\r\n\r\n“So we shall have the pleasure of your company as far as Brindisi,”\r\n said Mr. Kennedy, turning to Heideck. The latter bowed, to show the old\r\ngentleman that he had interpreted his intentions correctly.\r\n\r\nAn expression of violent alarm overspread Edith’s face, when the\r\ncontradiction which she might assuredly have expected did not follow.\r\nShe got up to go to her room, but, passing close by Heideck, she found\r\nan opportunity to whisper, “To-night on the balcony! I must speak to\r\nyou!”\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Heideck and Mr. Kennedy sat smoking on the terrace in front\r\nof the dining-room. A warm sea-breeze rustled through the banyan trees,\r\nwith their thick, shining arch of foliage. Heideck again thanked the old\r\ngentleman for his kindly efforts on his behalf.\r\n\r\n“I have only repaid to a very moderate extent all you have done for us,”\r\n replied Mr. Kennedy. “Besides, there was no difficulty in the matter. I\r\ntold the Governor that you were a German and a friend of my family,\r\nwho had rendered most valuable service to an English lady and myself.\r\nCertainly, I thought that I might with a good conscience say nothing\r\nabout your being a soldier, which might easily have caused all kinds\r\nof difficulties. With all my patriotism, I do not reproach myself\r\nvery severely for this reticence. For what military secrets could you\r\ndisclose in Berlin? Our disasters are plain for all to see, and the\r\npapers are filled with news and conjectures.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. The real purpose of my journey has been overtaken by events\r\nand rendered pointless.”\r\n\r\n“And this object--if I may speak without mincing words--was espionage.\r\nIs not that the case, Mr. Heideck?”\r\n\r\n“Espionage in the same sense that the despatch of ambassadors, ministers\r\nplenipotentiary, and military or naval attaches is espionage,” replied\r\nHeideck, visibly annoyed.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I think there is a slight difference in their case. All these\r\ngentlemen’s names and duties are known beforehand, and they are\r\nexpressly accredited in their character of diplomatists.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Kennedy, I could never think of justifying myself to you, for I\r\nhave not the least reason to be ashamed of my mission. The military\r\nauthorities of every country must have information as to the military\r\ncondition of other powers, even though war is not definitely expected or\r\ncontemplated. In order to be equipped against all eventualities, it is\r\nnecessary to know the forces and resources of other powers, no matter\r\nwhether, in case of war, they would be enemies or allies.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy, evidently irritated, replied: “It almost seems as if we\r\nEnglish had grossly neglected this precaution. The Russians would\r\nhardly have surprised us, if we had known how to calculate with German\r\nastuteness.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I hardly believe that the English method in this respect is\r\ndifferent from ours. Your Government, like the German, doubtless sent\r\nofficers everywhere to obtain information. Just as the General Staff in\r\nBerlin collects information about all foreign armies, fortifications,\r\nand boundaries, I have no doubt that the same thing happens in London.\r\nBesides, it is a purely theoretical procedure, just like the drawing up\r\nof schemes of war to suit all cases. In reality, things usually turn\r\nout quite differently from what is expected. The present war is the most\r\nconvincing proof of this. I was sent here to study the Anglo-Indian army\r\nand the Russo-Indian frontiers, although we had no presentiment that war\r\nwas imminent, and had made no plans for attacking India. The folly\r\nof such an idea is obvious. Further, if you regard me as a spy, Mr.\r\nKennedy, I beg you will have no scruple about informing the Governor of\r\nmy real character. I am ready at any time to justify myself before the\r\nEnglish authorities.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy held out his hand to him.\r\n\r\n“You have misunderstood me, my dear Mr. Heideck. Your personal honour is\r\nto me so far beyond all doubt, that I should never think for a moment\r\nof putting you on a level with those spies who are tried for their lives\r\nwhen caught.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment one of the barefooted waiters, dressed in white, came\r\nrunning and shouting into the saloon, “Great victory near Delhi! total\r\ndefeat of the Russian army!” at the same time triumphantly waving a\r\nprinted paper in his hand.\r\n\r\nMr. Kennedy jumped up, tore the paper from the boy’s hand, and read the\r\nnews given out by the Bombay Gazette.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is true,” he cried, his face beaming with joy. “A victory,\r\na great, decisive victory! Heaven be thanked--the fortune of war has\r\nchanged.”\r\n\r\nHe gave the bearer of the joyful news a piece of gold and hastened\r\nto inform the ladies. Heideck, however, remained behind, immersed in\r\nthought. The hotel soon became lively. The English ran here and there,\r\nshouting to one another the contents of the despatch, while a growing\r\nexcitement gradually showed itself in the streets. In the so-called\r\nfort, the European quarter of Bombay, torches were lighted and\r\nfeux-de-joie fired. Heideck took one of the traps standing in front\r\nof the hotel and ordered the driver to drive through the town. Here he\r\nobserved that the rejoicings were confined to the fort. As soon as the\r\nconveyance reached the town proper, he found that it presented the same\r\nappearance as on his first visit, and that there was nothing to show\r\nor indicate the occurrence of extraordinary events. In spite of the\r\nlateness of the hour, the narrow streets were busy and full of traffic.\r\nAll the houses were lighted up, and all the doors open, affording a\r\nview of the interior of the primitive dwellings, of the artisans busy\r\nat their work, of the dealers plying their trade, of the housewives\r\noccupied with their domestic affairs. Evidently the inhabitants troubled\r\nno more about the war than about the terrible scourge of the Indian\r\npopulation--the plague. The despatch announcing the victory, although\r\nno doubt it was known in the native quarter, had evidently not made the\r\nslightest impression.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o’clock Heideck returned to the hotel, where he found the\r\nKennedys and Edith still conversing eagerly on the terrace.\r\n\r\n“Of course we shall not leave now,” he declared. “As soon as the\r\nRussians have evacuated the north, we shall return to Simla.”\r\n\r\nHeideck made no remark, and since the openly expressed and heartfelt joy\r\nof the English affected him painfully, he soon took leave of them, and\r\nwent up to his room, which, like Edith’s, was on the second storey.\r\n\r\nAccording to the custom of the country, all the rooms opened on to the\r\nbroad balcony which ran round the whole floor like an outer corridor.\r\nAs a look from Edith had repeated her wish that he should wait for her\r\nthere, he stepped out on to the balcony. His patience was not put to\r\na severe trial. She must have quickly found an opportunity of escaping\r\nfrom the Kennedys’ society, for he saw her coming towards him even\r\nsooner than he had expected.\r\n\r\n“I thank you for waiting for me,” she said, “but we cannot stay here,\r\nfor we should not be safe from surprise for a moment. Let us go into my\r\nroom.”\r\n\r\nHeideck followed her with hesitation. But he knew that Edith would\r\nfeel insulted if he expressed any scruples at her request, for her firm\r\nconfidence in his chivalrous honour relieved her of all apprehension.\r\nOnly the moon, shining faintly, shed a dim light over the room. The\r\nclock on the tower of the neighbouring university struck twelve.\r\n\r\n“Destiny is playing a strange game with us,” said Edith, who had seated\r\nherself in one of the little basket chairs, while Heideck remained\r\nstanding near the door. “I confess that since the arrival of the news of\r\nthe victory I have spent some terrible hours, for the Kennedys have, in\r\nconsequence, abandoned their idea of leaving, and seem to take it for\r\ngranted that I shall remain with them in India.”\r\n\r\n“And would you not, in fact, be forced to do so, my dearest Edith?”\r\n\r\n“So then you have already reckoned with this contingency? You would not,\r\nsurely, think of travelling without me? But perhaps you would even feel\r\nrelieved at being freed from me?”\r\n\r\n“How can you say such things, Edith, which, I am sure, you do not\r\nbelieve?”\r\n\r\n“Who knows? You are ambitious, and we poor women are never worse off\r\nthan when we have to do with ambitious men.”\r\n\r\n“But there is probably no necessity for us to torment ourselves with the\r\ndiscussion of such contingencies. I have never for a moment believed in\r\nany alteration of our arrangements for the journey.”\r\n\r\n“That is to say you doubt the trustworthiness of the report of the\r\nvictory?”\r\n\r\n“To speak frankly, I do. I did not wish to mortify the old gentleman and\r\nspoil his shortlived joy. That is the reason why I did not express my\r\ndistrust in his presence. But the despatch does not really convey\r\nthe impression of being true. It does not even contain a more exact\r\nstatement of the place where the battle is said to have taken place.\r\nIt must, at least, strike the unprejudiced observer as being very\r\nsuspicious.”\r\n\r\n“But who would take the trouble to obtain the melancholy satisfaction of\r\ndeceiving the world in such a manner for a short time?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, there are many who would be interested in doing so. In the course\r\nof every war such false reports are always floating about, in most cases\r\nwithout their origin being known. It may be a money-market manoeuvre.”\r\n\r\n“So you think it quite impossible that we can beat the Russians?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly impossible, but extremely improbable--at least while the\r\nmilitary situation remains what it is. Again, it is the absence of\r\ndefinite information that surprises me. A victorious general always\r\nfinds time to communicate details, which the vanquished is only too glad\r\nto defer. I am convinced that the bad news will soon follow, and that,\r\nas far as our plans for the journey are concerned, everything will\r\nremain as before.”\r\n\r\nEdith was silent. Her belief in Heideck was so unbounded that his\r\nwords had completely convinced her. But they did not restore the joyful\r\nconfidence of the last few days.\r\n\r\n“Everything will remain as before?” she said at length. “That means you\r\nwill leave us at Brindisi.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. There is no other way for me to reach the army.”\r\n\r\n“And suppose you abandon the idea of returning to the army altogether?\r\nHave you never thought that we might find another foundation on which to\r\nbuild our future happiness?”\r\n\r\nHeideck looked at her in amazement.\r\n\r\n“No, dearest Edith, I have not thought of it. It would have been a\r\nuseless and foolish idea, so long as my duty and honour prescribe most\r\ndefinitely what I have to do.”\r\n\r\n“Duty and honour! Of course, I ought to have known that you would at\r\nonce be ready again with fine words. It is so convenient to be able to\r\ntake shelter behind so unassailable a rampart, if at the same time it\r\nfalls in with one’s own wishes.”\r\n\r\n“Edith! How unjust the melancholy events of the last few weeks have made\r\nyou! If you think it over quietly, you will see that my personal wishes\r\nand my heart’s desires are not in question at all. And really I do not\r\nunderstand what you think I could possibly do.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, there would be more than one way of sparing us the pain of a\r\nseparation, but I will only mention the first that occurs to me.\r\nCouldn’t we very well remain together in India? If it is the question\r\nof money that makes you hesitate, I can soon make your mind easy on that\r\npoint. I have enough money for both of us, and what is mine is yours.\r\nIf we retire to a part of the country which the war cannot reach, a hill\r\nstation such as Poona or Mahabeleshwar, no one will trouble you with\r\nquestions or think of following you. And if you live there and devote\r\nyourself to your love instead of slaying your fellow-men, it will be\r\nmore acceptable to God.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of the seriousness with which she spoke, Heideck could not help\r\nsmiling as he answered: “What a wonderful picture of the world and its\r\naffairs is sometimes drawn in a pretty woman’s little head! It is really\r\nfortunate that we sober-minded men do not allow our heart to run away\r\nwith our head so easily. Otherwise we should come badly off, for you\r\nyourselves would certainly be the first to turn away from us with\r\ncontempt, if we tried to purchase the happiness of your love at any\r\nprice--even at the price of your respect.”\r\n\r\nEdith Irwin did not contradict him. Silent and sorrowful, for a long\r\ntime she looked out upon the bright moonlight Indian night. Then, when\r\nHeideck approached her, to take leave of her with tender words, she said\r\nin a voice which cut him to the heart: “Whether we understand each other\r\nor not, in one thing at least you shall be under no delusion. Whereever\r\nyou may go--into a paradise of peace or the hell of war--I will not\r\nforsake you.”\r\n\r\nWith passionate impetuosity she flung herself into his arms and pressed\r\nher burning lips upon his. Then, as if afraid of her own heart’s\r\npassion, she gently pushed him towards the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nHOMEWARD BOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Heideck had foreseen, the announcement of the victory was followed\r\nby disastrous tidings for the English. Up to noon on the following day\r\nBombay had waited in vain for confirmation of the despatch and fuller\r\nparticulars. Very late in the evening, amidst a general feeling of\r\ndepression, the Governor published the following despatch from the\r\nCommander-in-Chief:--\r\n\r\n“The enemy having been reported in great force yesterday to the north\r\nof Delhi, our army took up a favourable defensive position, and a battle\r\nwas fought with great honour to the British arms. The Russians suffered\r\nenormous losses. The approach of darkness preventing us from following\r\nup the advantages we had gained, I ordered the main body of the army\r\nto carry out a strategic retreat on Lucknow, chiefly along the railway.\r\nSimpson’s brigade remained behind to defend Delhi. The heavy guns of\r\nthe Sha, Calcutta gate, and north gate bastions were very effective.\r\nAll arms distinguished themselves, and deserve the highest praise. The\r\nbridge over the Jumna is intact and affords direct communication with\r\nGeneral Simpson.”\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Kennedy was sitting pondering over this despatch, Heideck came\r\nup to him.\r\n\r\n“A decisive defeat, isn’t it, Mr. Heideck?” said he. “As a military man,\r\nyou can read between the line, better than I can. But I know Delhi. If\r\nthe Jumna bridge batteries have been firing, the Russians must be on the\r\npoint of capturing this passage. The north gate bastion is the head of\r\nthe bridge.”\r\n\r\nHeideck was obliged to agree; but he had read more in the despatch, and\r\ndrew the worst conclusions from the general’s retreat on Lucknow.\r\n\r\nNo more despatches from the theatre of war were published during the\r\nday, since the Governor was desirous of concealing the melancholy state\r\nof affairs from the people. But Mr. Kennedy, who had been in Government\r\nHouse, knew more. He told Heideck that the English army had fled in\r\ncomplete disorder, having lost 8,000 killed and wounded, twenty guns,\r\nand a number of colours and standards. The Government had already\r\nabandoned all hope of saving Delhi, for General Simpson could not\r\npossibly hold it. “We have lost India,” sorrowfully concluded Mr.\r\nKennedy. “It is the grave of my last hopes.”\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe Caledonia was moored in Victoria Dock, which formed part of the\r\nmagnificent harbour on the east coast of the peninsula. In the midst\r\nof a seething crowd the passengers were making their way on board.\r\nMany wounded and sick officers and soldiers were returning on the fast\r\nsteamer to England, and filled the places intended for passengers. No\r\ntravellers to Europe on business or pleasure were to be seen. All the\r\nwomen on board belonged to the families of the military. The general\r\nfeeling was one of extreme melancholy.\r\n\r\nBefore embarking Heideck had discharged his faithful servant. Morar\r\nGopal, with tears in his eyes, had begged him to take him with him, but\r\nHeideck was afraid that the European climate would be the death of the\r\npoor fellow. Besides, he would have been obliged to part with him on\r\nactive service. So he gave him a hundred rupees--a fortune for Morar\r\nGopal.\r\n\r\nThe great steamer moved slowly out of the basin of the harbour, past\r\nEnglish merchantmen and the white ships of war, which had brought troops\r\nand war material.\r\n\r\nAs the Caledonia, continually increasing her speed, made her way through\r\nthe outer harbour, Heideck saw some twenty men-of-war in the roadstead,\r\nincluding several large ironclads. English troops from Malta were being\r\nlanded in boats from two transports, the decks of which glistened with\r\narms.\r\n\r\nThe Caledonia proceeded with increasing rapidity into the open sea. The\r\ncity and its lighthouses disappeared in the distance, the blue mountains\r\nof the mainland and of the island were lost in a floating mist. A long,\r\nglittering, white furrow followed in the wake of the steamer.\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful journey for all whom a load of anxiety had not\r\nrendered insensible to the grandeur of Nature. Heideck, happy at being\r\nat last on the way home, enjoyed the beauty of sea and sky to the full.\r\nThe uneasy doubts which sometimes assailed him as to his own and Edith’s\r\nfuture were suppressed by the charm of her presence. Her impetuosity\r\ncaused him perpetual anxiety, but he loved her. Ever since she had\r\ndeclared that she would never leave him she had been all devotion\r\nand tenderness, as if tormented by a constant fear that he might\r\nnevertheless one day cast her off.\r\n\r\nSo they sat once again, side by side, on the promenade deck. The\r\nazure billows of the sea splashed round the planks of the vessel. The\r\nboundless surface of ocean glittered with a marvellous brilliancy, and\r\neverything seemed bathed in a flood of light. The double awning over the\r\nheads of the young couple kept off the burning heat of the sun, and a\r\nrefreshing breeze swept across the deck beneath it.\r\n\r\n“Then you would land with me at Brindisi?” asked Heideck.\r\n\r\n“At Brindisi, or Aden, or Port Said--where you like.”\r\n\r\n“I think Brindisi will be the most suitable place. Then we can travel\r\ntogether to Berlin.”\r\n\r\nEdith nodded assent.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t know how long I shall stay in Berlin,” continued Heideck.\r\n“I hope I shan’t be sent to join my regiment at once.”\r\n\r\n“If you are I shall go with you, wherever it may be,” she said as\r\nquietly as if it were a matter of course.\r\n\r\n“That would hardly be possible,” he rejoined, with a smile. “We Germans\r\nmake war without women.”\r\n\r\n“And yet I shall go with you.”\r\n\r\nHeideck looked at her in amazement. “But don’t you understand, dear,\r\nthat it would be something entirely novel, and bound to create a\r\nsensation, for a German officer to take the field with his betrothed?”\r\n\r\n“I am not afraid of what people think. I don’t care what the Kennedys\r\nmay say if I leave the ship at Brindisi and go with you. Of course it\r\nwill be a sad downfall for me. They would look on me as a lost woman\r\nfrom that moment. But I care nothing about that. I have long been cured\r\nof the foolish idea that we must sacrifice our happiness to what the\r\nworld may say.”\r\n\r\nOf course Heideck refused to take her words seriously. He did not\r\nbelieve she meant to accompany him to the field, and seized the\r\nopportunity of making a proposal which he had already carefully\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n“I should think the best thing for you to do, my dear Edith, would be to\r\ngo to my uncle at Hamburg and stay there till the war is over. Then--if\r\nHeaven spare my life--there will be nothing to prevent our union.”\r\n\r\nAs she made no answer Heideck, who wanted to give her time to think,\r\nhastened to turn the conversation.\r\n\r\n“Look how beautiful it is!” he said, pointing to the water.\r\n\r\nA long succession of white, foaming waves kept pace with the vessel on\r\neither side. The keel seemed to be cutting its way through a number\r\nof tiny cliffs, over which the sea was breaking. But closer inspection\r\nshowed that they were no cliffs, but countless shoals of large fish,\r\nswimming alongside the ship, as if in order of battle. From time to time\r\nthey leaped high out of the water, their bright, scaly bodies glistening\r\nin the sun.\r\n\r\n“I should like to be one of those dolphins,” said Edith. “Look, how free\r\nthey are! how they enjoy life!”\r\n\r\n“You believe in the transmigration of souls?” said Heideck jestingly;\r\n“perhaps you have once been such a dolphin yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Then certainly I have made no change for the better. There is no doubt\r\nthat our higher intellectual development prevents us from properly\r\nenjoying our natural existence. But it teaches us to feel more deeply\r\nthe sorrows, which are far more numerous than the joys of human life.”\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe journey through the Indian Ocean took six days, and Heideck\r\nfrequently had an opportunity of hearing the views of English officers\r\nand officials on the political situation. All blamed the incapacity of\r\nthe Government, which had brought England into so perilous a situation.\r\n\r\n“The good old principles of English policy have been abandoned,” said a\r\nColonel, who had been severely wounded and was returning home invalided.\r\n“In former times England made her conquests when the continental Powers\r\nwere involved in war, or she carried on war with allies, to enlarge her\r\npossessions. But she has never allowed herself to be so disgracefully\r\nsurprised before. Of course we shall beat France and Germany, for it is\r\na question of sea power. But even when they are beaten, we shall still\r\nhave the worst of it; the loss of India is as bad for England’s health\r\nand efficiency as the amputation of my left leg for me. I am returning\r\nto England a cripple, and my poor country will only be a cripple after\r\nshe has lost India.”\r\n\r\n“Quite true,” said Mr. Kennedy; “I am afraid it will be\r\ndifficult--impossible, to recover India. We were able to rob the French,\r\nthe Dutch, and the Portuguese of their Indian possessions, since their\r\nonly connexion with India was by sea; but the Russians will annex the\r\npeninsula to their Empire and, even in case of a defeat, will be able\r\nto send fresh troops without number overland. I can already see them\r\nattacking Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, occupying the harbours built\r\nwith our money, and building a fleet in our docks with the resources of\r\nIndia.”\r\n\r\n“We have no right to blame the continental Powers,” continued the\r\nColonel, “for using our defeats for their own aggrandisement. There\r\nis no Power at whose expense we have not grown great. We took all\r\nour possessions by force of arms from the Spaniards, the Dutch, the\r\nPortuguese, and the French; we have always opposed Russia, since she\r\nbegan to develop her power. We supported Turkey, we invaded the Crimea\r\nand destroyed Sebastopol, we suffocated her fleet in the Black Sea. But\r\nthis time we are out of our reckoning. We have allowed the Japanese to\r\nattack Russia; but if our ministers believed that Japan would fight for\r\nany one but herself, they have made a great mistake. Russia is making us\r\npay for her losses in the Far East.”\r\n\r\n“It is not Russia, but Germany, that is our worst enemy,” contradicted\r\nMr. Kennedy. “Russia has only been our enemy since we let Germany grow\r\nso powerful. I remember how our ministers exulted when Prussia was\r\nat war with France and Austria. The continent of Europe again seemed\r\nparalysed for a long time by internal disruption. But our triumph was\r\nshort-lived! No one had suspected that Prussia would prove so strong.\r\nThen the first defects in our policy became apparent. After the first\r\nGerman victories on the Rhine, England ought to have concluded an\r\nalliance with France and declared war against Prussia. Great political\r\nrevolutions require considerable time, and a clever government should\r\nalways look ahead. Bismarck slowly prepared England’s defeat. Thirty\r\nyears ago we had a presentiment of this; it threatened us like a\r\nstorm-cloud, but our Government had not the courage to look things in\r\nthe face and lacked the energy.”\r\n\r\nA general, who had hitherto said nothing, took up the conversation. He\r\nbelonged to the engineers, and was on his way to take over the command\r\nof Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n“We talk about the loss of India,” said he; “but who knows whether we\r\nhave not to fear an invasion of England herself?”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!” exclaimed all the gentlemen present; “England will never\r\nallow her men-of-war to be driven out of the Channel.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so too, but I don’t know whether you gentlemen remember how\r\nclose the danger of Napoleon landing an army on English soil once was.”\r\n\r\n“And if it had made its appearance, it would have been smashed to pieces\r\nby British fists!” cried Mr. Kennedy.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps. But why have we never consented to the Channel Tunnel being\r\nmade? All military authorities, especially Wolseley, are absolutely\r\nopposed to opening a road so convenient for traffic and trade. They have\r\nalways declared that England must remain an island, only accessible\r\nby sea. This is certainly the first and most essential condition of\r\nEngland’s power.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Mr. Kennedy, “as England is still an island, and we\r\nhave always adhered to the principle of keeping a fleet superior to that\r\nof the two strongest naval powers, where is the danger?”\r\n\r\n“Danger? There is always a danger, when one has enemies,” replied the\r\nGeneral. “I maintain that at the beginning of the nineteenth century, it\r\nwas a toss up whether Napoleon crossed or not; and I don’t believe that\r\nwe should have been a match for our great opponent, if he had once got a\r\nfirm footing on our coast.”\r\n\r\n“His plan was a visionary one and therefore impracticable.”\r\n\r\n“His plan only failed because it was too complicated. If he had had\r\nmodern telegraphic communication at his disposal, this would not have\r\nbeen the case. He could have directed the operations of his fleet by\r\ncable. If Admiral Villeneuve had sailed to Brest (instead of Cadiz) as\r\nhe was ordered and joined Admiral Gantaume, he would have had fifty-six\r\nships of the line to cover Napoleon’s passage from Boulogne to the\r\nEnglish coast. No, gentlemen, you must not think England’s strategical\r\nposition unassailable. I am as confident of the superiority of our naval\r\nforces as you are, but in these days of steam and electricity England is\r\nno longer as safe as she was when the movement of ships depended on the\r\nwind and orders had to be given by mounted messengers and signals.”\r\n\r\n“So you really think, General, that Napoleon’s plan would have been\r\npracticable?”\r\n\r\n“Most certainly. Napoleon had no luck in this enterprise. In the\r\nfirst place, his greatest misfortune was the death of Admiral\r\nLatouche-Treville. If he had been in Villeneuve’s place, he would most\r\nlikely have proved a competent commander. He was the only French naval\r\nofficer who could have opposed Nelson. But he died too soon for France,\r\nand his successor, Villeneuve, was his inferior in ability. But there\r\nare other special circumstances, more favourable to a landing in England\r\nthan in Napoleon’s day. For instance--to say nothing of cable and\r\nsteam--the fact that modern transports can carry an enormously larger\r\nnumber of troops. Napoleon had to fit out 2,293 vessels to transport his\r\narmy of 150,000 men and to protect the transports, had 1,204 gunboats\r\nand 135 other armed vessels at his disposal, in addition to the\r\ntransports proper. As nearly all his ships were constructed to land\r\nmen, horses, and guns on the level beach without the aid of boats, they\r\nwanted calm weather for crossing the Channel. They would have taken\r\nabout ten hours, with a calm sea, to reach a point between Dover and\r\nHastings. It is different now. The large French and German companies’\r\nsteamers are at the disposal of their Admiralties.”\r\n\r\n“And yet things are just the same as before,” said Mr. Kennedy. “Victory\r\non the open sea turns the scale. No hostile fleet will be able to show\r\nitself in the Channel without being destroyed by ours.”\r\n\r\n“Let us hope so!” said the General.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Aden the Caledonia only met a few ships--all English.\r\nSeveral transports with troops on board and a few men-of-war passed\r\nher; as she travelled on the average twenty-two knots an hour, no vessel\r\novertook her. On the morning of the sixth day the reddish brown rocks of\r\nAden appeared, and the Caledonia cast anchor in the roadstead. A number\r\nof small vessels darted towards her. Naked, black Arab boys cried for\r\nmoney and showed their skill in diving, fishing up pieces of silver\r\nthrown from the ship. As the Caledonia had to coal, those passengers who\r\nwere able to move went ashore in boats rowed by Arabs.\r\n\r\nHeideck joined the Kennedy family.\r\n\r\nWhen the boat reached the deeply indented harbour, which with its\r\nnumerous bends between fortified heights afforded a safe shelter for a\r\nwhole fleet, Heideck saw some twenty English men-of-war, and at\r\nleast three times that number of French and German and a few Russian\r\nmerchantmen, which had been captured by the English. Several cruisers of\r\nthe three Powers at war with England also lay in the harbour. They had\r\nbeen captured in the Indian Ocean at the outbreak of war by superior\r\nEnglish naval forces.\r\n\r\nAs the party had the whole day at their disposal, Mr. Kennedy took\r\na conveyance, and Heideck drove with the family to the town, which,\r\ninvisible from the roadstead, lay embedded between high, peaked\r\nmountains. The road went past a large, open space, on which thousands\r\nof camels and donkeys were exposed for sale. Here Heideck had the\r\nopportunity of admiring, close at hand, the mighty fortifications which\r\nthe English had constructed on the important corner of the mountain\r\ncommanding the sea since the capture of Aden by them from the Turks\r\non the 9th of January, 1839. They also inspected the remarkable tanks,\r\nthose famous cisterns which supply Aden with water, some fifty basins\r\nsaid to hold 30,000,000 gallons of water, whose origin is lost in the\r\nhoary mist of antiquity. They are said to have been constructed by the\r\nPersians.\r\n\r\nAbout seven o’clock in the evening the passengers were again on board.\r\nWhile the Caledonia continued her journey, they were absorbed in the\r\nperusal of the English, French, and German newspapers which they had\r\nbought at Aden. The papers were ten days old, certainly, but contained\r\nmuch that was new to the travellers.\r\n\r\nIt was very hot in the Red Sea, and most of the first-class passengers\r\nslept on deck, as they had done just before they reached Aden. Part of\r\nthe deck, over which a sail had been stretched, was specially reserved\r\nfor ladies.\r\n\r\nThe Caledonia, having again coaled at Port Said, where a number of\r\nEnglish men-of-war were lying, resumed her journey, with unfavourable\r\nweather and a rather rough sea, into the Mediterranean. Passing along\r\nthe south of Crete, the steamer turned northwest in the direction of\r\nBrindisi, where she was due on the eighth day after leaving Aden. On the\r\nmorning of the seventh day a ship was seen coming from the north side\r\nof Crete, whose appearance caused the captain of the Caledonia the\r\nliveliest anxiety, which soon communicated itself to the passengers. All\r\nthe telescopes and field-glasses were directed towards the vessel, whose\r\ncourse was bound to cut across that of the Caledonia. She soon came near\r\nenough to be recognised. She was the small French cruiser Forbin, and\r\nwas bound to meet the Caledonia if the latter continued her course.\r\n\r\nThe Forbin was a third-class cruiser, not so fast as the Caledonia (the\r\nofficers estimated her speed at twenty-one knots), which could have\r\nbeaten her in a race; but if the Caledonia made for Brindisi, she was\r\nbound to meet the Frenchman, and could only expect to be captured.\r\nAccordingly, the captain altered his course and turned westwards towards\r\nMalta, without heeding the signal to stop or the shots that were fired,\r\none of which only went through the rigging, without doing any damage\r\nworth mentioning.\r\n\r\n“It is now noon,” said Heideck. “We ought to be in Brindisi to-morrow.\r\nInstead, we shall be in La Valetta, unless the captain changes his\r\ncourse again and trusts to the speed of the Caledonia to reach Brindisi\r\nin spite of the Forbin.”\r\n\r\nThen a loud shout was heard. The look-out man reported a ship on the\r\nport side, and in a few minutes two other vessels suddenly appeared.\r\n\r\nOne of them afterwards proved to be the French second-class cruiser\r\nArethuse; the others were the protected cruiser Chanzy and a\r\ntorpedo-destroyer.\r\n\r\nThe Caledonia could not possibly get past the French in the direction of\r\nMalta, for the destroyer was much faster and capable of making, at\r\nfull speed, twenty-seven knots an hour. The captain had no choice; he\r\naccordingly turned round, and began to make for Alexandria again.\r\n\r\nWhile the great vessel was wheeling round, those on board perceived that\r\nthe French had seen her and had started in pursuit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Forbin had approached considerably nearer and was\r\nattempting to cut off the Caledonia. The captain accordingly gave orders\r\nto steer further south.\r\n\r\nHeideck, standing with Edith on the promenade-deck, followed the\r\nmovements of the vessels.\r\n\r\n“What would happen to us if the French overtook us?” asked Edith.\r\n“Surely they would not fire on an unarmed ship?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. But they would call upon us to discontinue our journey,\r\nand then they would take the Caledonia to the nearest French port.”\r\n\r\n“Is that the rule of naval warfare? Is the general law of nations so\r\ndefective that a passenger steamer can be captured? The Caledonia is not\r\na combatant. She is taking home wounded men and harmless passengers.”\r\n\r\n“Our captain doesn’t seem to have much confidence in the laws of naval\r\nwarfare or nations in this case,” said Heideck. “In fact, nothing is\r\nmore uncertain than these definitions. Strictly speaking, there is no\r\nsuch thing as international law; the stronger does what he likes with\r\nthe weaker, and the only check on the arbitrariness of the victor is the\r\nfear of public opinion. But this fear does not weigh much with him who\r\nhas might on his side, especially as he knows that public opinion can be\r\nbribed.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Edith, with a pitiful smile, “international law is very\r\nlike the law which is generally practised amongst human beings on land.”\r\n\r\n“Besides, the French would not make a bad catch if they brought in the\r\nCaledonia,” continued Heideck. “Of the eight hundred passengers about\r\nthree hundred belong to the army, and I have heard that there are large\r\nsums of money on board.”\r\n\r\nThe promenade-deck was full of first-class passengers, who anxiously\r\nfollowed the movements of the ships. The second-class and steerage\r\npassengers were equally anxious. In the most favourable circumstances,\r\nif the Caledonia escaped her pursuers, her passage would, of course, be\r\nconsiderably delayed. But it was hardly to be expected that she would\r\nreach Alexandria; for though the Chanzy (travelling about twenty-two\r\nknots) was obviously outpaced, the destroyer kept creeping up and the\r\nForbin was dangerously near.\r\n\r\nThen a fresh surprise was reported. Two steamships were coming towards\r\nthe Caledonia. All glasses were directed to where the tiny pillars of\r\nsmoke appeared above the surface of the water, and it was soon seen\r\nbeyond doubt that they carried the British flag.\r\n\r\nThe second officer informed the passengers that they were the\r\nfirst-class cruiser Royal Arthur and the gunboat O’Hara. He expressed\r\nhis hope that the Caledonia would reach their protection before the\r\nFrench overtook her.\r\n\r\nThe water was fairly calm. Sky and sea had ceased to shine and sparkle\r\nsince the Caledonia had left the Suez Canal and emerged into the\r\nMediterranean. The grey colouring, peculiar to European latitudes, was\r\nseen instead, and streaky clouds scudded over the pale-blue sky. The\r\nmovements of the ships could be closely followed by this light.\r\n\r\nThe English vessels approached rapidly. When the distance between the\r\nRoyal Arthur and the French destroyer was about two knots and a half\r\nthe cruiser opened fire from her bow-guns upon the destroyer, which only\r\nstood out a little above the surface of the water. One of the heavy shot\r\nwhizzed so closely past the Caledonia, which was now between the two,\r\nthat the passengers could plainly hear the howling noise of the shell as\r\nit cut through the air.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman, without returning the fire, slackened speed, to wait till\r\nthe Chanzy came up. Meanwhile the Forbin advanced from the north\r\nand opened fire from its bow-guns upon the British gunboat, and soon\r\nafterwards the Chanzy fired its first shot. The position of the vessels\r\nwas now as follows: the gunboat lay broadside opposite the Forbin, the\r\ntwo cruisers were firing with their bow-guns on each other, while the\r\ndestroyer kept in the background. In the meantime the Caledonia had\r\nadvanced so far that she was completely protected by the British guns.\r\n\r\nIf the captain had now continued his course he would probably have\r\nreached Alexandria in safety. But he wished to avoid the delay, which\r\nwould have been considerable, and the entreaties of the passengers,\r\nwho, greatly excited, begged him to remain near the scene of action,\r\ncoincided with his own wishes.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Caledonia slackened speed, and took up a position to the\r\nsouth-east of the field of battle, whence she could make for Brindisi or\r\nAlexandria as soon as the result was decided.\r\n\r\nFor some time neither side gained the advantage. The Chanzy and Royal\r\nArthur had turned broadsides to each other and fired, but the effect was\r\nnot visible from the Caledonia.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Royal Arthur began to move in a northerly direction, firing\r\nupon the enemy from her stern-guns.\r\n\r\n“It almost looks as if he meant to help the O’Hara,” said Heideck to\r\nEdith, who was standing by his side with a field-glass. “The gunboat\r\nis clearly no match for the Forbin, and has perhaps been hopelessly\r\ndamaged.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Royal Arthur continued her course northwards, maintaining\r\nan incessant fire upon the Chanzy and the destroyer, which still kept on\r\nthe watch in the rear, and made for the Forbin, on which she immediately\r\nopened fire with her bow-guns.\r\n\r\nAs the scene of action thus shifted further and further north, the\r\ncaptain of the Caledonia resolved to turn westwards again. It did not\r\nseem advisable to call at Malta, but assuming that the Royal Arthur\r\ncould hold the French ships for a considerable time, he might fairly\r\nhope to reach Brindisi, his original destination.\r\n\r\nBut the course of events disappointed his hopes. A ship was reported\r\nahead, which proved to be the Arethuse, bearing down straight on\r\nthe Caledonia. To avoid meeting her the captain immediately headed\r\nnorthwards. This brought the Caledonia closer to the scene of action\r\nthan had been intended, so close that a British shell, discharged at the\r\ndestroyer lying to the east, flew over the low French vessel, and fell\r\ninto the sea right before the bows of the Caledonia, raising great jets\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nA few seconds later the French destroyer moved rapidly in the direction\r\nof the Royal Arthur, and the passengers of the Caledonia, and all the\r\nsailors on the now more restricted field of operations, witnessed a\r\nfearful sight. The destroyer had seized the right moment to attack, and\r\nfrom one of its tubes had launched a torpedo with splendid aim against\r\nthe enemy. In the centre of the Royal Arthur, just above the water-line,\r\na tiny cloud of smoke was seen, and then a large column of water\r\nspurting up. At the same time a dull, loud report was heard that shook\r\nthe air for a considerable distance round and drowned the thunder of the\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nIt looked as if the cruiser was being torn asunder by the hands of\r\ngiants. The enormous hull split in two. Slowly the prow leaned\r\nforwards, the stern backwards. Immediately afterwards both parts righted\r\nthemselves again, as if they would close up over the gaping breach. But\r\nthis movement only lasted a few seconds. Then the weight of the water\r\nrushing in drew the gigantic hull into the depths. The Royal Arthur sank\r\nwith awe-inspiring rapidity. Now only her three funnels were seen above\r\nthe surface of the water; a few minutes later nothing was visible save\r\nthe top of the mast and the top-pennants hoisted for battle. Then a\r\nmighty, foaming billow rose on high, and only the breaking of the waves\r\nmarked the spot where the proud cruiser lay.\r\n\r\nThe guns had ceased firing, and deep silence reigned on all the ships.\r\nThe passengers were paralysed by overwhelming horror. The captain\r\nordered all the boats to be launched to go to the assistance of the crew\r\nof the Royal Arthur. The Chanzy also was seen to be letting down boats.\r\nThe O’Hara fled, to avoid falling into the hands of the superior French\r\nforces, and withdrew from the scene of action in an easterly direction,\r\npursued by the Forbin, which sent shot after shot after her. If the\r\ncaptain of the Caledonia had abandoned all idea of flight, he was not\r\nonly following the dictates of humanity, but obeying the signals of the\r\ndestroyer, ordering him to bring to. He knew that there was no longer\r\nany chance of escape for the steamer entrusted to his care, since the\r\nshells of the Royal Arthur had ceased to threaten the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe struggles of the unhappy men, who had reached the surface from the\r\ngloomy depths, and were now making desperate efforts to save themselves,\r\npresented an affecting sight. Those who could not swim soon went under,\r\nunless they succeeded in getting hold of some floating object. Every\r\nsecond more of the numerous heads, which had been seen above the water\r\nimmediately after the sinking of the cruiser, disappeared, and there was\r\nno doubt that the crews of the boats, though working heroically, would\r\nonly be able to save a small part of the crew.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the commander of the Chanzy’s gig lay to at the gangway of the\r\nCaledonia. The first officer, with four marines and a non-commissioned\r\nofficer, boarded the steamer and saluted the captain with naval\r\npoliteness.\r\n\r\n“I greatly regret, sir, to be compelled to inconvenience you and your\r\npassengers. But I am acting under orders, and must ask you to show me\r\nyour papers and to allow me to search the ship.”\r\n\r\n“It is yours to command, as things are,” replied the Englishman\r\ngloomily.\r\n\r\nHe then went down with the Frenchman into the cabin, while the\r\nnon-commissioned officer remained with the soldiers on the gangway. The\r\nproceedings lasted nearly two hours, during which the work of rescuing\r\nthe crew of the Royal Arthur was continued unremittingly. A hundred and\r\ntwenty soldiers and sailors and five officers, besides the commander,\r\nwere saved. Most of the officers and crew were lost.\r\n\r\nUnusual steps were taken to secure the prize. The captain, with the\r\nfirst and second officers, was taken on board the Chanzy. The first\r\nofficer of the Chanzy took command of the ship, and two lieutenants\r\nand fifty men were transferred to the Caledonia. These precautions were\r\nsufficiently justified by the great value of the cargo. According to\r\nthe ship’s papers, the Caledonia carried no less than 20,000,000 rupees,\r\nsome in specie, others in silver bars, consigned from Calcutta to\r\nEngland. The French commander was naturally very anxious to take so\r\nvaluable a cargo safely to Toulon.\r\n\r\nA further triumph fell to the lot of the French. The British gunboat,\r\nflying the tricolour in place of the Union Jack, was brought back to the\r\nscene of action by the Forbin. All four French ships accompanied the two\r\ncaptive vessels on the voyage to Toulon--full steam ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURES OF THE CALEDONIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passengers of the Caledonia were in a state of hopeless dejection\r\nand violent exasperation. An attempt was made to throw the blame of\r\ntheir misfortune on the unpardonable carelessness of the responsible\r\nmilitary authorities, rather than attribute it to an accident that could\r\nnot have been reckoned upon.\r\n\r\n“Here we have another striking example of English lack of foresight,”\r\n said Mr. Kennedy. “The idea of allowing the Caledonia to travel without\r\nprotection! Think of all the men-of-war lying idle at Bombay, Aden, and\r\nPort Said! And yet nobody thought there was any occasion to send one\r\nor more of them to escort this splendid ship, with nearly a thousand\r\nEnglishmen on board, and a cargo worth more than a million. Had our\r\ncommanders no suspicion that the French ships were so near?”\r\n\r\n“Our commanders relied upon there being enough English ships cruising in\r\nthe Mediterranean to prevent such enterprises,” said the General.\r\n\r\nBut this excuse was not accepted, and bitter were the reproaches hurled\r\nat the English way of managing the war. When night came on the majority\r\nof the passengers, utterly exhausted by the exciting events they had\r\ngone through, retired to their cabins. But Heideck remained on deck for\r\nsome time, cooling his heated forehead in the delightful night breeze.\r\nThe squadron quickly pursued its course through the gently rushing\r\nwaves, the position of each ship being clearly defined by the\r\nsidelights. On the right was the Chanzy, on the left the Arethuse, in\r\nthe rear the Forbin and the O’Hara, manned by a French crew. Nothing\r\ncould be seen of the destroyer. At length Heideck, tired of hearing the\r\nregular steps of the French sentries pacing up and down the deck, went\r\ndown to his cabin. He was soon asleep, but his rest was broken by uneasy\r\ndreams. The battle, of which he had been a spectator, was fought again.\r\nHis dreams must have been very vivid, for he thought he heard, without\r\ncessation, the dull roar of the guns. He rubbed his eyes and sat up in\r\nhis narrow berth. Was it a reality or only a delusion of his excited\r\nsenses? The dull thunder still smote on his ear; and, having listened\r\nintently for a few moments, he jumped up, slipped on his clothes, and\r\nhurried on deck. On the way he met several passengers, who had also been\r\nwoke by the report of the guns. As soon as he reached the deck, he saw\r\nthat another violent naval engagement was in progress.\r\n\r\nThe night was rather dark, but the flash from the guns showed fairly the\r\nposition of the enemy, which became perfectly clear, when a searchlight\r\nfrom the Arethuse played over the surface of the water with dazzlingly\r\nclear light. The huge hulks of two battleships, white and glittering,\r\nemerged from the darkness. In addition, there were to be seen five\r\nsmaller warships and several small, low vessels, the torpedo-boats of\r\nthe British squadron, which was advancing to meet the French. Then,\r\nbright as a miniature sun, a searchlight was turned on also by the\r\nEnglish. It was an interesting spectacle to notice how the two electric\r\nlights, slowly turning round, as it were lugged each ship out of the\r\ndarkness, showing the guns where to aim.\r\n\r\nThe French squadron, whose commander was well aware of the enemy’s\r\nsuperiority, began to bestir itself rapidly. All the vessels, the\r\nCaledonia included, turned round and retreated at full speed. But the\r\nheavy English shells from the guns of the battleships were already\r\nbeginning to fall amongst them, although the distance might have been\r\nthree knots. Suddenly, when the Caledonia, in the course of a turning\r\nmanoeuvre, showed a broadside to the British fire, a sharp, violent\r\nshock was felt, followed by the report of a violent explosion. The\r\nCaledonia stopped dead, and loud cries of agony were heard from the\r\nengine-room. The passengers, frightened to death, ran about the deck.\r\nIt could not be concealed from them that the ship had been struck by a\r\nshell, which had exploded.\r\n\r\nBut it proved that the Caledonia, although badly injured, was in no\r\nimmediate danger. Only her speed and manoeuvring capacity had suffered\r\nconsiderably owing to a steampipe having been hit.\r\n\r\nThe French warships retired as rapidly as possible, leaving the\r\nCaledonia and the prize crew on board to their fate, since it was\r\nimpossible to take her with them. They were obliged to abandon the\r\nvaluable prize and rest content with their great success in the\r\ndestruction of the Royal Arthur and the capture of the O’Hara. The\r\nCaledonia, being recognised by the searchlight thrown upon her, had no\r\nfear of being shot at again. She moved slowly northwards, and in the\r\nearly morning was overtaken by two British cruisers. An officer came on\r\nboard, declared the French prize crew prisoners of war, and was informed\r\nby the third officer, who was now in command, of the events of the last\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nWhile the British squadron followed the French ships the Caledonia,\r\nonly travelling eight knots an hour, made for Naples, which was reached\r\nwithout further incidents. The passengers were disembarked, the large\r\nsum of money was deposited in the Bank of Naples to the credit of\r\nthe English Government, and only the cargo of cotton, carpets, and\r\nembroidered silkstuffs was left on board.\r\n\r\nThe Kennedys and Mrs. Irwin went to the Hotel de la Riviera. They were\r\naccompanied by Heideck, who intended to stay only one day at Naples, and\r\nthen to take the through train to Berlin.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had said nothing to her about going to Berlin Edith\r\nsuspected his intention. A few hours later she spoke to him in the\r\nreading-room, where he was eagerly studying the papers.\r\n\r\n“Any news of importance?”\r\n\r\n“Everything is new to me. Up to the present we have only had a glimpse\r\nof what has been going on; these papers have given me a comprehensive\r\nview of events for the first time.”\r\n\r\n“And now, of course, your only desire is to see your colours again? I\r\nknow that it is only ambition that guides you.”\r\n\r\n“Can you reproach an officer for that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if he forgets humanity as well. But make your mind easy, I shall\r\nnot attempt to hinder you. I will not stand in the way of your ambition,\r\nbut neither will I sacrifice myself to it.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly you should not do so. We shall be happy when the war is over.\r\nI will be as true to you as to my duty. If I return alive my existence\r\nshall be devoted to making you happy.”\r\n\r\n“Love is like a bird; it must not be allowed too much freedom. Remember,\r\nI have always told you I will never leave you.”\r\n\r\n“But, dearest Edith, that is utterly impossible! Have you any idea what\r\nwar is like?”\r\n\r\n“I should have thought I had seen enough of it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, in India and on sea. But in Europe war is carried on somewhat\r\ndifferently. Every seat in the trains is calculated exactly; it is the\r\nsame in barracks, cantonments, and bivouacs. There is no room for a\r\nwoman. What would my comrades say of me if I appeared in your company?”\r\n\r\n“You can say I am your wife.”\r\n\r\n“But, Edith, the idea is not to be seriously thought of. As a Prussian\r\nofficer I need permission before I can marry. How can I join my regiment\r\nin the company of a lady? Or how could I now get leave to marry?”\r\n\r\n“Quite easily. Many officers marry at the beginning of a war.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but even if I get leave now, according to the law we could not be\r\nmarried for some months. I have already proposed that you should go to\r\nmy relatives at Hamburg and wait there till the war is over, and I still\r\nthink that is the only right thing to do.”\r\n\r\n“But I will not go to your relatives at Hamburg.”\r\n\r\n“And why not?”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that I, an Englishwoman, would go and live in a German\r\nfamily to be stared at? Do you think I could bear to read all the lies\r\nabout England in the German newspapers?”\r\n\r\n“My uncle and aunt are people of great tact, and my cousins will show\r\nyou due respect.”\r\n\r\n“Cousins! No, thank you! I should be out of place in the midst of the\r\ndomestic felicity of strangers.”\r\n\r\n“If you won’t go there, you might stop at a pension in Berlin.”\r\n\r\n“No, I won’t do that either. I will stay with you.”\r\n\r\n“But, dearest Edith, how do you think this could be managed?”\r\n\r\n“I will have nothing to do with conventionalities; otherwise life in\r\nGermany would be intolerable. I should die of anxiety in a pension,\r\nthinking every moment of the dangers to which you are exposed. No, I\r\ncouldn’t endure that. I have lived through too much--seen too much that\r\nis terrible. My nerves would not be strong enough for me to vegetate\r\nin a family or a Berlin pension in the midst of the trivialities of\r\neveryday life. Have pity on me, and don’t leave me! Your presence is the\r\nonly effectual medicine for my mind.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! dearest Edith, my whole heart is full of you, and I would gladly do\r\nas you wish. But every step we take must be practical and judicious.\r\nIf you say you will stay with me, you must have some idea in your mind.\r\nHow, then, do you think we can manage to be together? Remember that on\r\nmy return I shall be an officer on service, and shall have to carry out\r\nthe orders I receive.”\r\n\r\n“I have already thought of a way. Prince Tchajawadse had a page with\r\nhim; I will be your page.”\r\n\r\n“What an absurd idea! Prussian officers don’t take pages with them on\r\nactive service.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind the name. You must have servants, like English officers; I\r\nwill be your boy.”\r\n\r\n“With us soldiers are told off for such duties, my dear Edith.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will go with you as a soldier. I have already gone as a rajah.”\r\n\r\nHeideck knitted his brows impatiently. The young woman, whose keen eyes\r\nhad noticed it, went on impetuously: “Although it seems you are tired\r\nof me, I will not leave you. Distance is love’s worst enemy, and you are\r\nthe only tie that binds me to life.”\r\n\r\nHeideck cast down his eyes, so as not to betray his thoughts. Since\r\nhe had read the papers, which gave him a clearer idea of the political\r\nsituation, his mind was fuller than before of warlike visions. He loved\r\nEdith, but love did not fill his life so completely as it did hers. The\r\nnews in the Italian and French papers had put him into a regular fever\r\nafter his long absence from Europe. The dissolution of the Triple\r\nAlliance, and Germany’s new alliance with France and Russia, had caused\r\na complete alteration in the political horizon. He heard the stamping\r\nof horses, the clash of arms, the thunder of cannon. The war was full of\r\nimportance and boundless possibilities.\r\n\r\nIt was a question of Germany’s existence! Her losses up to the present\r\nwere estimated at more than three milliards. All the German colonies had\r\nbeen seized by the English, hundreds of German merchant-men were lost,\r\nGerman foreign trade was completely paralysed, German credit was shaken.\r\nUnless Germany were finally victorious, the war meant her extinction as\r\na great Power.\r\n\r\nHe sprang up.\r\n\r\n“It must be, dearest Edith; we must soon part!”\r\n\r\nShe turned pale. With a look of anguish she caught at his hand and held\r\nit fast.\r\n\r\n“Do not leave me!”\r\n\r\n“I must have perfect freedom--at present. After the war I belong\r\nentirely to you.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, you cannot be so cruel! You must not leave me!”\r\n\r\n“We shall meet again! I love you and will be true to you. But now I ask\r\na sacrifice from you. I am a German officer; my life now belongs to my\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nShe slid from her chair to the ground and clasped his knees.\r\n\r\n“I cannot leave you; it will bring you no happiness, if you destroy me.”\r\n\r\n“Be strong, Edith. I always used to admire your firm, powerful will.\r\nHave you all at once lost all sense, all reason?”\r\n\r\n“I have lost everything,” she cried, “everything save you. And I will\r\nnot give you up!”\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Irwin!” cried a voice of horror at this moment, “can it be\r\npossible?”\r\n\r\nEdith got up hurriedly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kennedy and her daughter had entered unobserved. They had witnessed\r\nthe singular situation with utter astonishment and heard Edith’s last\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens, can it be possible?” stammered the worthy lady; then,\r\nturning to her daughter, she added, “Go, my child.”\r\n\r\nEdith Irwin had quickly recovered her composure. Standing up, her head\r\nproudly raised, she faced the indignant lady.\r\n\r\n“I beg you to remember, Mrs. Kennedy, that no one should pass judgment\r\nwithout knowing the real state of things.”\r\n\r\n“I think what I have seen needs no explanation.”\r\n\r\n“If there is anything blameworthy in it, I alone am responsible,”\r\n interposed Heideck. “Spare me a few minutes in private, Mrs. Kennedy,\r\nand I will convince you that no blame attaches to Mrs. Irwin.”\r\n\r\n“I want no one to defend me or intercede for me!” cried Edith\r\npassionately. “Why should we any longer conceal our love? This man,\r\nMrs. Kennedy, has saved my life and honour more than once, and it is no\r\nhumiliation for me to go on my knees before him.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was something in her face and the tone of her voice that\r\ntouched the Englishwoman’s heart, in spite of her outraged sense of\r\npropriety. The stern expression disappeared from her features, and she\r\nsaid with friendly, almost motherly gentleness--\r\n\r\n“Come, my poor child! I have certainly no right to set up for a judge of\r\nyour actions. But I am certainly old enough for you to trust in me.”\r\n\r\nEdith, overcome by this sudden kindness, leaned her head on Mrs.\r\nKennedy’s shoulder. Heideck felt it would be best to leave the two\r\nladies to themselves.\r\n\r\n“If you will permit me, ladies, I will leave you for the present.”\r\n\r\nWith a rapid movement Edith laid her hand upon his arm.\r\n\r\n“You give me your word, Captain Heideck, that you will not leave without\r\nsaying good-bye to me?”\r\n\r\n“I give you my word.”\r\n\r\nHe left the room in a most painful state of mind. It seemed as if, in\r\nthe fulfilment of his duty, he would have to pass over the body of the\r\nbeing who was dearest to him on earth.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Mrs. Kennedy’s maid brought him a short note from Edith,\r\nasking him to come to her at once. He found her in her dimly-lighted\r\nroom on the couch; but as he entered she got up and went to meet him\r\nwith apparent calmness.\r\n\r\n“You are right, my friend; I have in the meantime come to my senses\r\nagain. Nothing else is possible--we must part.”\r\n\r\n“I swear to you, Edith--”\r\n\r\n“Swear nothing. The future is in God’s hands alone.”\r\n\r\nShe drew from the ring-finger of her left hand the hoop-ring, set\r\nin valuable brilliants, which had given rise to their first serious\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“Take this ring, my friend, and think of me whenever you look at it.”\r\n Tears choked her utterance. “Have no anxiety for me and my future. I am\r\ngoing with the Kennedys to England.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nA SUSPICIOUS FISHING-SMACK\r\n\r\n\r\nA raw north wind swept over the island of Walcheren and the mouth of the\r\nWest Schelde, ruffling into tiny waves the water of the broad stream,\r\nwhich in the twilight looked like a shoreless sea. Only those acquainted\r\nwith the ground knew that the flashing lights of the beacons at Flushing\r\non the right and at Fort Frederik Hendrik on the left marked the limits\r\nof the wide mouth of the harbour. Here, in 1809, when Holland was under\r\nthe rule of Napoleon Bonaparte, a powerful English fleet had entered\r\nthe Schelde to attack Flushing, and take the fortress. In the centre,\r\nbetween the two lights, which were about three miles apart, the German\r\ncruiser Gefion lay tossing at anchor. On the deck stood Heideck, who on\r\nhis return had been promoted to major and appointed to the intelligence\r\ndepartment for the coast district of Holland.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon he had seen a vessel entering the Schelde, which the\r\npilot had identified as one of the fishing-smacks plying between the\r\nShetland Islands and the Dutch ports. Heideck had informed the captain\r\nof the Gefion of his suspicion that the smack might be intended for\r\nanother purpose than trading in herrings. The little vessel had put\r\nin on the left bank, between the villages of Breskens and Kadzand, and\r\nHeideck decided to row across to it.\r\n\r\nSix marines and four sailors, under the command of a mate, manned one\r\nof the Gefion’s boats, and set out for the left bank in the direction of\r\nthe suspected vessel. It cost the oarsmen, struggling with the tide and\r\nwind which came howling from the sea, nearly half an hour’s hard work\r\nbefore they saw the dark hull of the smack emerging clearly outlined\r\nbefore them. A hoarse voice from on board asked what they wanted.\r\n\r\n“His Majesty’s service!” answered Heideck, and, as the boat lay to, he\r\nthrew off his cloak, so as to spring on deck more easily. Three men,\r\nin the dark, woollen smock and tarpaulined hat of coast fishermen,\r\napproached him and, in answer to his inquiry for the master, told him,\r\nin an unintelligible mixture of Dutch and German, that he had gone\r\nashore.\r\n\r\n“His name?”\r\n\r\n“Maaning Brandelaar.”\r\n\r\n“What is the name of this vessel?”\r\n\r\n“Bressay.”\r\n\r\nThe answers were given with hesitation and sullenly, and the three men\r\nshowed such evident signs of irritation that Heideck felt they would\r\nhave gladly thrown him overboard had it not been for the respect\r\ninspired by his uniform.\r\n\r\n“Where from?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“From Lerwick.”\r\n\r\n“Where to?”\r\n\r\n“We are going to sell our herrings. We are respectable people, Herr\r\nmajor.”\r\n\r\n“Where are you going to sell your herrings?”\r\n\r\n“Where we can. The skipper has gone to Breskens. He intended to be back\r\nsoon.”\r\n\r\nHeideck looked round. The smack had put to in a little bay, where the\r\nwater was quiet. The village of Breskens and the little watering-place,\r\nKadzand, were both so near that the lighted windows could be seen. It\r\nwas nine o’clock--rather late for the business which Maaning Brandelaar\r\nintended to transact at Breskens.\r\n\r\nHeideck sent the marines on deck with orders to see that no one left\r\nthe ship before the captain returned. He then ordered a lantern to be\r\nlighted to examine below. It was a long time before the lantern was\r\nready, and it burned so dully that Heideck preferred to use the electric\r\nlamp which he always carried with him as well as his revolver. He\r\nclimbed down the stairs into the hold and found that the smell of\r\npickled herrings, which he had noticed on deck, was sufficiently\r\nexplained by the cargo. In the little cabin two men were sitting,\r\ndrinking grog and smoking short clay pipes. Heideck greeted them\r\ncourteously and took a seat near them. They spoke English with a broad\r\nScotch accent, and used many peculiar expressions which Heideck did not\r\nunderstand. They declared they were natives of the island of Bressay.\r\nHeideck gathered from their conversation that the smack belonged to a\r\nshipowner of Rotterdam, whose name they appeared not to know or could\r\nnot pronounce. They were very guarded and reserved in their statements\r\ngenerally. Heideck waited half an hour, an hour--but still no signs of\r\nthe captain. He began to feel hungry, and throwing a piece of money on\r\nthe table, asked whether they could give him anything to eat.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen opened the cupboard in the wall of the cabin and brought\r\nout a large piece of ham, half a loaf of black bread, and a knife and\r\nfork. Heideck noticed two small white loaves in the cupboard amongst\r\nsome glasses and bottles. “Give me some white bread,” said he. The man\r\nwho had brought out the eatables murmured something unintelligible to\r\nHeideck and shut the cupboard again without complying with his request.\r\nHis behaviour could not help striking Heideck as curious. He had, as a\r\nmatter of fact, only asked for white bread because the black was old,\r\ndry, and uncommonly coarse; but now the suspicion forced itself upon\r\nhim that there was some special meaning behind the rude and contemptuous\r\nmanner in which his request had been received.\r\n\r\n“You don’t seem to have understood me,” he said. “I should like the\r\nwhite bread.”\r\n\r\n“It belongs to the captain,” was the reply; “we mustn’t take it.”\r\n\r\n“I will pay for it. Your captain will certainly have no objection.”\r\n\r\nThe men pretended not to hear.\r\n\r\nHeideck repeated his request in a stern and commanding tone. The men\r\nlooked at each other; then one of them went to the cupboard, took out\r\nthe white bread, and set it on the table. Heideck cut it and found it\r\nvery good. He ate heartily of it, wondering at the same time why the\r\nmen had been so disobliging about it at first. When he took up the bread\r\nagain to cut himself off a second piece, it occurred to him that it was\r\nremarkably heavy. He cut into the middle and, finding that the blade\r\nof the knife struck on something hard, he broke the loaf in two. The\r\nglitter of gold met his eyes. He investigated further and drew out,\r\none after the other, thirty golden coins with the head of the Queen\r\nof England upon them. Thirty pounds sterling had been concealed in the\r\nloaf.\r\n\r\n“Very nourishing bread of yours,” said he, looking keenly at the men,\r\nwho merely shrugged their shoulders.\r\n\r\n“What has it to do with us how the captain keeps his money?” said one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“You are quite right. What has it to do with you? We will wait till\r\nthe captain comes. There, put the bread and the money back into the\r\ncupboard, and then make a nice glass of grog for my men, the poor\r\nfellows will be frozen. Here are three marks for you.”\r\n\r\nThe men did as they were asked. One of them went upstairs with the\r\nsmoking jug, bringing it back empty some time afterwards, with the\r\nthanks of the Herr major’s men.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later one of the soldiers appeared at the cabin door and\r\nannounced that two men were approaching from land. “Good,” said Heideck;\r\n“keep quiet, till they are on deck; then don’t let them go down again,\r\nbut tell them to come here.”\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately steps and voices were heard above, and in a few\r\nminutes two men entered the cabin. The first, who wore the dress of a\r\nskipper, was of unusually powerful build, broad-shouldered, bull-necked,\r\nwith a square weather-beaten face, from which two crafty little\r\neyes twinkled. The second, considerably younger, was dressed rather\r\nfoppishly, and wore a beard trimmed in the most modern style.\r\n\r\n“Mynheer Brandelaar?” queried Heideck.\r\n\r\n“That’s me,” replied the man with the broad shoulders, in a brusque,\r\nalmost threatening tone.\r\n\r\n“Very glad to see you, mynheer. I want to speak to you on a matter of\r\nbusiness; I have been waiting for you more than an hour. May I ask you\r\nto introduce me to this gentleman?”\r\n\r\nThe Dutchman was slow in answering. It was evident that he was in a\r\nvery bad temper and did not quite know what to do. The officer’s quiet,\r\nsomewhat mocking tone obviously disconcerted him.\r\n\r\nHe signed to the two sailors to withdraw, then turned to Heideck.\r\n\r\n“This gentleman is a business friend. And I should like to know what\r\nI and my affairs have got to do with you at all. I am here to sell my\r\nherrings. I suppose that isn’t forbidden?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. But if you have your business, mynheer, I have mine. And\r\nI think it would be pleasantest for both of us if we could settle the\r\nmatter here at once without having to row over to the Gefion.”\r\n\r\n“To the Gefion? What’s the meaning of that? What right have you to use\r\nforce with me? My papers are in order; I can show them to you.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to see them. But won’t you be kind enough to tell me this\r\ngentleman’s name? It is really of interest to me to make your business\r\nfriend’s acquaintance.”\r\n\r\nThe second visitor now thought it advisable to introduce himself.\r\n\r\n“My name is Camille Penurot,” said he; “I am a grocer in Breskens.\r\nMaaning Brandelaar has offered to sell me his cargo, and I have come\r\nwith him to inspect the goods.”\r\n\r\n“And no doubt night is the best time for that,” rejoined Heideck in a\r\nsarcastic tone, but with an imperturbably serious air. “Now let me see\r\nyour papers, Mynheer Brandelaar.”\r\n\r\nJust as he had expected, the papers were in perfect order. The fishing\r\nsmack Bressay, owner Maximilian van Spranekhuizen of Rotterdam,\r\nsailing with a cargo of pickled herrings from Lerwick. Captain, Maaning\r\nBrandelaar. Attested by the English harbour officials at Lerwick.\r\nEverything perfectly correct.\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said Heideck. “Rear-Admiral Sir Frederick Hollway of Dover\r\nhas not endorsed them, but that was not necessary at all.”\r\n\r\nThese words, uttered with perfect calmness, had an astounding effect\r\nupon the two men. Penurot’s pale face turned almost green; Brandelaar’s\r\nhard features were frightfully distorted in a grimace of rage. Half\r\nchoking in the effort to keep down a furious curse, he drew a deep\r\nbreath, and said--\r\n\r\n“I don’t know any Admiral Hollway, and I have never been in Dover in my\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well! Let us talk about your business--or yours, M. Penurot. Of\r\ncourse the cargo of herrings which you want to buy is not meant to be\r\nsold at Breskens, but to some business friend at Antwerp? isn’t it so?”\r\n\r\nNo answer was given. Heideck, as if it were the most natural thing in\r\nthe world, turned to the cupboard and, before the others had grasped his\r\nintention, took out the second white loaf and broke it in two. This time\r\na folded paper came to light. Heideck spread it out and saw that it was\r\ncovered with a long list of questions written in English.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said he, “the gentleman who had this paper baked with\r\nyour breakfast bread must be confoundedly curious. ‘How strong is\r\nthe garrison of Antwerp? What regiments? What batteries? Who are the\r\ncommanders of the outer fort? What is the exact plan of the flooded\r\ndistrict? How is the population disposed towards the German troops? How\r\nmany German men-of-war are there in the harbour and in the Schelde? How\r\nare they distributed? Exact information as to the number of cannon and\r\ncrews of all the men-of-war. How many and which ships of the German\r\nnavigation companies are allotted to the German fleet? How many troops\r\nare there on the island of Walcheren? How many in the neighbourhood of\r\nAntwerp? How are the troops distributed on both banks of the Schelde?\r\nAre troops ready to be put on board the men-of-war and transports? Has\r\na date been settled for that? Is there a plan for employing the German\r\nfleet? What is said about the German fleet joining the French?’ That is\r\nonly a small portion of the long list; but it is quite enough for anyone\r\nto guess at the nature of the rest of the questions. What the deuce!\r\nAdmiral Hollway would like to learn everything for his paltry thirty\r\npounds! or were they only a little on account? I cannot believe, M.\r\nPenurot, that your Antwerp correspondent would be willing to sell so\r\nmuch for thirty pounds.”\r\n\r\nThe two men were clearly overwhelmed by the weight of the unexpected\r\nblow. For a moment, when Heideck drew the paper out of the bread, it\r\nlooked as if Brandelaar would have thrown himself upon him and attempted\r\nto tear it from him by force. But the thought of the soldiers probably\r\nrestrained him opportunely from such an act of folly. He stood where he\r\nwas with tightly compressed lips and spitefully glistening eyes.\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand you, Herr major,” exclaimed Penurot with a visible\r\neffort. “I know nothing whatever about this paper. I am an honest\r\nbusiness man.”\r\n\r\n“And of course, Herr Brandelaar, you had no suspicion of the important\r\nstuffing in your white bread? Now, I am not called upon to investigate\r\nthe matter further. It will be for the court-martial to throw light on\r\nthe affair.”\r\n\r\nThe grocer turned as pale as death, and lifted up his hands imploringly.\r\n\r\n“Mercy, Herr major, mercy! As true as I live, I am innocent.”\r\n\r\nHeideck pretended not to have heard his assertion.\r\n\r\n“Further, I must tell you, gentlemen, that you are confoundedly bad men\r\nof business, to risk your lives for a miserable thirty pounds. That\r\nwas an inexcusable folly. If ever you wanted to make money in that way,\r\nreally you would have done better to work for us. We would pay a man\r\nfive times as much without haggling, if he would furnish us with really\r\ntrustworthy information of this kind about the English fleet and army.”\r\n\r\nAt these words, spoken almost in a jovial tone, a gleam of hope showed\r\nitself in the countenance of the two men. The grocer had opened his\r\nmouth to reply, when Heideck signed to him to be silent.\r\n\r\n“Be so good as to go on deck for a while, Penurot,” said he. “I will\r\ncall you when I want to continue the conversation. You shall give me\r\nyour company first, Brandelaar. I should like a few words with you in\r\nprivate.”\r\n\r\nThe man with the fashionably pointed beard obeyed. Then Heideck turned\r\nto the Dutchman--\r\n\r\n“This Penurot is the guilty party, isn’t he? As a skipper you have\r\nprobably never troubled yourself much about politics during your\r\nlifetime: you scarcely had a correct idea of the risk you were running.\r\nIf the court-martial condemns you, you will only have your friend\r\nPenurot to thank for it.”\r\n\r\n“What you say is quite true, sir,” replied Brandelaar with well-acted\r\nsimplicity. “I have my cargo to sell for the firm of Van Spranekhuizen,\r\nand I don’t care a damn for war or spying. I beg the Herr major to put\r\nin a good word for me. I had no suspicion of what was inside the bread.”\r\n\r\n“So this Penurot has drawn you into the affair without your knowing it.\r\nDid he intend to go with you to Antwerp?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you the whole truth, Herr major! Admiral Hollway at Dover,\r\nwho is in control of the intelligence department for the Channel and\r\nthe coast from Cuxhaven to Brest, gave me the two loaves for Camille\r\nPenurot. That is all I know of the matter.”\r\n\r\n“Was it the first time you had to carry out such commissions for Admiral\r\nHollway?”\r\n\r\n“So help me God, the first time!”\r\n\r\n“But Penurot was not meant to keep these peculiar loaves for himself?\r\nHe, like yourself, is only an agent? If you want me to speak for you,\r\nyou must tell me unreservedly everything you know about it.”\r\n\r\n“Penurot has a business friend in Antwerp, as the Herr major has rightly\r\nguessed.”\r\n\r\n“His name?”\r\n\r\n“Eberhard Amelungen.”\r\n\r\n“What is he?”\r\n\r\n“A wholesale merchant. My cargo is intended for him.”\r\n\r\n“And how is he connected with Penurot?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Penurot is an agent who does all kinds of business.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! and what does the owner, Mynheer van Spranekhuizen, say to your\r\nhaving anything to do with such things as the conveyance of these\r\nloaves?”\r\n\r\n“Mynheer van Spranekhuizen and Mynheer Amelungen are near relations.”\r\n\r\n“In other words, these two gentlemen have agreed to send the Bressay\r\nfrom the Shetlands to Dover, and from Dover to Antwerp.”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing about that, Herr major. I have told you everything I\r\nknow. No vessel can go further up the Schelde than Ternenzen, and I can\r\nunload at Breskens just as well as at Ternenzen and send the goods by\r\nrail to Antwerp.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Brandelaar, go upstairs again and send M. Penurot down to me.”\r\n\r\nWith heavy tread the skipper mounted the narrow ladder, and almost at\r\nonce Penurot entered. Heideck, with a wave of his hand, invited him to\r\nsit down opposite and began to speak.\r\n\r\n“From what I have seen of Brandelaar I am convinced that he is an arrant\r\nrascal. It was very imprudent on your part to have anything to do with\r\na man like that. If you are brought before a court-martial, you have him\r\nto thank for it.”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, Herr major--my life isn’t in danger? I implore you,\r\nhave pity on me!”\r\n\r\n“It will matter little whether personally I have pity on you. You\r\nwill go with me to the Gefion and be brought before a court-martial at\r\nFlushing. The fact that you have been Brandelaar’s accomplice cannot be\r\ngot rid of. He has just now declared definitely that the two loaves were\r\nintended for you.”\r\n\r\n“For me? That is a vile lie. I have never received a penny from the\r\nEnglish.”\r\n\r\n“Well--but, without special reasons, a man doesn’t amuse himself by\r\npaying a visit to a herring-smack at night. The cargo could have been\r\ndelivered to Herr Eberhard Amelungen without your inspection.”\r\n\r\n“Eberhard Amelungen?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t pretend to be so ignorant. Brandelaar has already confessed\r\nso much, that you can easily admit the rest. Amelungen and Van\r\nSpranekhuizen are in a conspiracy to carry on a regular system of\r\nespionage in the interests of England. You are used as an agent, and\r\nMaaning Brandelaar is trying to get out of it by sacrificing you.”\r\n\r\n“So it seems, really. But I am quite innocent, Herr major. I know\r\nnothing of all that. The last time Brandelaar left the Schelde, he came\r\nto see me here in Breskens and told me that he would soon be back again\r\nand that it would be a good business for me.”\r\n\r\n“When did that happen?”\r\n\r\n“Three weeks ago. I had no reason to distrust Brandelaar, since he had\r\noften supplied goods for Amelungen.”\r\n\r\n“But why did you come on board to-day?”\r\n\r\n“Brandelaar wanted it. He said I could look at the cargo and discuss\r\nwhether it should be unloaded here or at Ternenzen.”\r\n\r\n“Now, M. Penurot, I will tell you something. You will go with me to\r\nAntwerp, where I will call on Herr Amelungen and convince myself whether\r\nyou are really as innocent as you say, and as I shall be glad to believe\r\nyou are for the present.”\r\n\r\nThe grocer appeared to be getting still more uneasy.\r\n\r\n“But you won’t take me before the court-martial?”\r\n\r\n“That remains to be seen. I can promise you nothing. Everything will\r\ndepend on the information which Herr Amelungen gives me about you, and\r\non your future behaviour. I will now have Brandelaar down again, and you\r\nwill remain silent while I speak to him.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, I will do everything the Herr major tells me.”\r\n\r\nBrandelaar having been summoned to the cabin, Heideck addressed him as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, Maaning Brandelaar. I know everything, and I need\r\nnot tell you that it is more than enough to put your neck in danger\r\naccording to martial law. But I will show you a way to save yourself. Go\r\nto-morrow to Ternenzen and wait there till you hear from me. I will make\r\nit easy for you to execute your commission; I will write the answers to\r\nAdmiral Hollway’s questions myself. You can then take them to Dover\r\nto your customer. But at the same time I will give you a number of\r\nquestions, to which you will bring me trustworthy answers at Flushing.\r\nIf you carry out this mission to my satisfaction, I will pay you 3,000\r\nmarks on your return. As you will also have your fee from the Admiral,\r\nyou will make a very good thing out of it. But beware of attempting to\r\nbetray me; it would turn out an extremely bad job for you. I know where\r\nI can catch you, and you would be imprisoned as soon as you showed\r\nyourself anywhere on the Dutch coast. So you had better think it over\r\ncarefully.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper’s broad countenance had gradually brightened, and at these\r\nwords a cunning grin overspread his features.\r\n\r\n“Three thousand marks! If that’s a bargain, Herr major, you can count\r\nupon my serving you honourably.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it isn’t so much a matter of your honour as of your cleverness.\r\nUnless the information you bring me corresponds with my expectations, of\r\ncourse the payment will suffer accordingly. The price depends upon the\r\nquality of the goods.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you will be satisfied with me. I have connexions over there, and if\r\nyou want anything else, you shall see what Brandelaar can do.”\r\n\r\n“Good! It will be to your own interest to serve me well and faithfully.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly the skipper again looked thoughtful.\r\n\r\n“There is still one thing that troubles me, Herr major.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“My men have seen an officer and soldiers visit my ship. Suppose they\r\ntalk about it over in England and the Admiral should suspect me?”\r\n\r\n“He will have no reason to do so, if he is convinced that your\r\ninformation is correct. He will have other sources of information\r\nbesides yourself, and if he finds your statements confirmed, he will\r\nhave complete confidence in you.”\r\n\r\nThese words did not allay Maaning Brandelaar’s uneasiness.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but--you don’t mean to give me correct information?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I do. Everything I write for you will be perfectly correct.”\r\n\r\nThis reply was clearly too much for the skipper to understand. He stared\r\nin speechless amazement at Heideck, who proceeded quietly--\r\n\r\n“The Admiral wants to know the strength of the German army at Antwerp,\r\nand I will tell you the condition of affairs. We have 120,000 men\r\nin Holland and the small portion of Belgian territory which we have\r\noccupied round Antwerp. In the fortress itself there are 30,000 men; on\r\nthe island of Walcheren only 5,000, in occupation of Flushing and other\r\nimportant points. These are entirely trustworthy facts.”\r\n\r\nThe Captain shook his head.\r\n\r\n“If it were not disrespectful, I should think you were making a fool of\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“No, my friend, I have no reason to do so; you can go bail for\r\neverything I write, and your fee will be honourably earned. It would be\r\nsomewhat different with the news you might take over to the Admiral on\r\nyour own responsibility.”\r\n\r\nBrandelaar nodded.\r\n\r\n“I understand, Herr major, and I will act accordingly. But I must\r\ncertainly get a fresh crew; these men know too much; that is bad, and\r\nthey might make it unpleasant for me.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, that would be quite a mistake. Keep your men and make no fuss.\r\nWhen I get to Ternenzen, I will have you and the crew arrested. You will\r\nbe examined by me and in a few days set at liberty.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper did not seem to relish this prospect.\r\n\r\n“But suppose you should change your mind in the meantime, and take me\r\nbefore the court-martial?”\r\n\r\n“You may confidently trust my word. It will only be a sham examination\r\nto prevent your men getting unprofitable ideas into their heads and\r\nbetraying anything which might arouse suspicion across the water. On the\r\ncontrary, it will look as if you had had to endure all kinds of dangers\r\nand disappointments; and if my estimate of you is correct, my worthy\r\nBrandelaar, you will not lose the opportunity of extracting an extra fee\r\nfrom the Admiral to make up for the anxiety you have suffered.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nCAMILLE PENUROT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Heideck and his prisoner, Penurot, reached the Gefion he found the\r\nCommander on deck, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. He reported\r\nhimself, and asked him to treat Penurot as a guest.\r\n\r\n“I was getting anxious about you,” said the Captain, “and was on\r\nthe point of sending the steam pinnace after you. Have you found out\r\nanything important?”\r\n\r\n“I believe I have. The two rascals whom I caught there don’t seem to\r\nbelong to the ordinary class of spies. They are the skipper Brandelaar\r\nand the man I have brought with me.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t you arrest the skipper as well?”\r\n\r\n“I intend to use them in our interest, and hope that Admiral Hollway\r\nwill find himself caught in his own net.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t that rather a risky game? If the fellows have betrayed Admiral\r\nHollway, you may rely upon it they will do the same by us.”\r\n\r\n“I trust to their fears and selfishness more than their honour. To take\r\ninformation about us to the English they must return here again, and so\r\nI hold them in my hand.”\r\n\r\n“But the converse is true. I confess I have very little faith in such\r\ndouble-dealing spies.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, I feel the same; but I believe I have at last found the way\r\nto the headquarters of the English system of espionage. In order to\r\nget to the bottom of the matter I cannot do without the aid of the two\r\nspies.”\r\n\r\n“The headquarters?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. The underlings who risk their lives are always of subordinate\r\nimportance. It is, above all, necessary to find out the persons\r\nof higher rank who prudently contrive to keep themselves in the\r\nbackground.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you success.”\r\n\r\n“Before going to Antwerp, whither M. Penurot is to accompany me\r\nto-morrow, I should like to make a report to the Imperial Chancellor.\r\nMay I ask you to let me have a boat to-morrow morning to go to\r\nFlushing?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. You can have any boat you like.”\r\n\r\n“Then I should like the steam pinnace.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you know whether the Chancellor intends to stay long at\r\nFlushing?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot say. In many ways Antwerp would certainly be a better place;\r\nbut he has gone to Flushing to make a demonstration.”\r\n\r\n“To make a demonstration?” repeated the Commander in a tone of\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n“The English, of course, know that he is there, and his presence at\r\nFlushing is bound to strengthen their belief that our main base of\r\noperations will be the mouth of the Schelde.”\r\n\r\n“Is it not surprising that our Chancellor is always at the centre of\r\noperations, though he is neither a general nor an admiral?”\r\n\r\n“We have seen the same before in the case of Bismarck. If we follow the\r\nhistory of the wars of 1864, 1866, and 1870-71 we get the impression\r\nthat Bismarck was in like manner the soul of all the operations,\r\nalthough his military title was only an honorary one.”\r\n\r\n“That is true; but the circumstances are essentially different. Bismarck\r\nwas a trained official, diplomatist, ambassador, before he became\r\nChancellor. His authority was great in military matters, independently\r\nof the generals; but our new Chancellor comes from quite a different\r\nsphere.”\r\n\r\n“But he has the power of a strong personality, and it is that which\r\nturns the scale in all great matters. The fine instinct of the people\r\nfeels that the Emperor has chosen rightly, and the Chancellor’s general\r\npopularity insures him powerful support even against the generals.\r\nBesides, everyone must admire his practical understanding and his wide\r\nrange of vision. Is not the occupation of Antwerp a fresh proof of it?\r\nThe rest of Belgium is occupied by the French army, but the Chancellor\r\nhas arranged with the French Government for us to hold Antwerp, since\r\nour fleet is in the Schelde. And I am sure we shall never give it up\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nThe Commander shook his head doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“You really think we shall be able to keep Antwerp without further\r\ntrouble?”\r\n\r\n“We must, and shall, have Antwerp. Belgium and the Netherlands may\r\ncontinue to exist, for we cannot with any justification annex them. But\r\nthe Netherlands and Antwerp will enter into closer political relations\r\nwith the German Empire for the sake of their own interests. Their\r\nGovernments are too weak to put down revolutionary movements in their\r\ncountries for any length of time. We are moving irresistibly towards\r\nthe formation of larger states. The fact that war in its attendant\r\nmanifestations is a means of promoting the union of peoples seems to me\r\nto some extent to mitigate its cruelty.”\r\n\r\n“That sounds very fanciful, Herr major,” said the Captain, turning the\r\nconversation. “But what sort of information do you propose to send by\r\nyour agents to Dover?”\r\n\r\n“I propose to confirm the Admiral in the idea that we intend to leave\r\nthe Schelde with the fleet and a number of our private companies’\r\nsteamers, and, with the support of the French fleet, to throw an army\r\nacross to Dover.”\r\n\r\n“I am surprised that the English have not even attempted to force our\r\npositions. One is almost tempted to believe that the English navy is as\r\ninefficient as the English army. If our enemies felt strong enough,\r\nthey would have appeared long ago before Brest, Cherbourg, Flushing,\r\nWilhelmshaven, or Kiel. Heligoland could not stop a fleet of ironclads\r\nfrom forcing its way into the Elbe; it ought rather to be a welcome\r\nobject of attack for the English fleet. If I were in command, I should\r\nset out against Heligoland with the older ironclads--Albion, Glory,\r\nCanopus, Coliath, Ocean, and Vengeance. The little island could\r\nhardly resist these six battleships for long, and the German North\r\nSea fleet--supposing one to exist--would be obliged to come out from\r\nWilhelmshaven to save its honour.”\r\n\r\n“The reason they do nothing of the sort is not so much the consciousness\r\nof their own weakness, as the fact that they have no one whose genius\r\nwould be equal to the situation. Certainly, they have several capable\r\nadmirals, but there is no Nelson among them. Perhaps our war also would\r\nhave remained in abeyance, had not the Emperor discovered in our new\r\nChancellor the genius needed by the times. The wars against Denmark,\r\nAustria, and France would hardly have taken place without Bismarck’s\r\ninitiative. Even under a most wretched government which commits\r\nthe grossest blunders great states can exist for a long time; but\r\nadvancement, real progress is only possible through the intervention of\r\na strong personality.”\r\n\r\n“I am not quite of your opinion. I am convinced that it is economic\r\nconditions that from time to time force on great revolutions. Do you\r\nthink, for instance, that the Russians would have conquered India if the\r\neconomic conditions of the natives had been better?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. Even a great man must have the soil prepared on which to\r\nprove his strength. And I think that our Chancellor has appeared on the\r\nscene just at the right moment.”\r\n\r\nHeideck took leave of the Commander and retired to his cabin to draw up\r\na report and take a well-deserved rest.\r\n\r\nWhen he sent for M. Camille Penurot on the following morning, he found a\r\nstriking alteration in him. That foppish gentleman no longer showed\r\nthe dejection of the day before, his dark eyes were bright and full of\r\nconfidence. By daylight, Heideck saw that his captive was a good-looking\r\nman about thirty years of age, more like a Spaniard than a Netherlander.\r\n\r\nHe bowed politely to Heideck and then asked, with a certain amount of\r\nconfidence, “Pardon me, Herr major, if I serve the German Empire well,\r\nmay I count on an adequate reward?”\r\n\r\n“I have already told you, M. Penurot, that we are prepared to pay more\r\nthan the English.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that was not what I meant. You mustn’t class me with Maaning\r\nBrandelaar and people of that sort.”\r\n\r\nHeideck smiled.\r\n\r\n“Will you be good enough to tell me, then, M. Penurot, with whom I am to\r\nclass you?”\r\n\r\n“I am willing from this moment to devote all my energies to the cause of\r\nthe allies.”\r\n\r\n“Granted. But what are your wishes in the matter of reward?”\r\n\r\n“I should like you to use your influence to obtain me the honour of an\r\norder.”\r\n\r\nHeideck was unable to conceal his astonishment at this strange request.\r\n\r\n“Such distinctions are, as a rule, only given in Germany for acts of\r\nbravery or for services which cannot be adequately requited in hard\r\ncash.”\r\n\r\n“What I am willing to do requires bravery.”\r\n\r\n“You are only going to help me to find out the spies in Antwerp.”\r\n\r\n“But they are dangerous people to make enemies of--people whose tools\r\nwould be capable of anything.”\r\n\r\n“Rest assured, M. Penurot, that your reward will correspond with the\r\nservices rendered. You know that I have no order to bestow, and besides,\r\nI do not quite understand of what importance a decoration can be to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“You rate my sense of honour too low, Herr major! But in order that you\r\nmay understand me, I will tell you a secret. I am in love with a lady of\r\nvery good family, and her people would be more ready to welcome me, if I\r\nhad an order.”\r\n\r\n“Then you have fixed your affections very high, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“That’s as one takes it. In the matter of birth, I am in that painful\r\nsituation which is the inheritance of all children born out of wedlock.\r\nMy mother was a Spanish dancer, my father is the wealthy Amelungen. He\r\nis fond of me and provides for me. It was he who bought the business in\r\nBreskens for me. But his wife, who is English, has no liking for me.”\r\n\r\n“I understand you even less than before. If you have such resources at\r\nyour disposal, why on earth do you mix yourself up in such dangerous\r\nundertakings?”\r\n\r\n“Herr Amelungen wished it.”\r\n\r\n“So, then, he really is the guilty party?”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, Herr major, you won’t abuse my confidence. I should\r\nnever forgive myself if anything I said were to harm Herr Amelungen.”\r\n\r\n“Do not be unnecessarily anxious. Nothing will happen either to you or\r\nto Herr Amelungen, if you can induce him to change sides and help us for\r\nthe future instead of the English.”\r\n\r\nPenurot hung down his head and remained silent.\r\n\r\n“And how about Herr van Spranekhuizen in Rotterdam?” continued Heideck.\r\n“Of course he belongs to the league.”\r\n\r\n“He is my father’s brother-in-law. His wife is an Amelungen.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the real reason why these two gentlemen, who I hear are\r\nwealthy merchants, have undertaken to act as spies for England?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, there is nothing so wonderful in that, Herr major. France has\r\noccupied Belgium, Germany the Netherlands. Of course they are very\r\nbitter about it.”\r\n\r\n“That may be. But well-to-do merchants are not in the habit of risking\r\ntheir lives out of pure patriotism in such circumstances. As a rule,\r\nonly those people do that who have little to lose.”\r\n\r\n“I have already told you that my father’s wife is English. For love of\r\nher he does a great deal which certainly nothing else would induce him\r\nto do.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Heideck, being informed that the pinnace was ready,\r\nrequested Penurot to accompany him on board. In the harbour of Flushing\r\nhe took leave of him for a while, with instructions to call upon him in\r\nan hour at his office, having told him exactly where it was. He had no\r\nfear that Penurot would attempt flight. He felt absolutely sure of this\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nEBERHARD AMELUNGEN\r\n\r\n\r\nOn arriving at his office close to the Duke of Wellington Hotel, Heideck\r\nfound his staff extremely busy. One lieutenant was looking through the\r\nFrench and German newspapers for important information; another was\r\nstudying the Russian and English journals. The last were few in number\r\nand not of recent date, limited to those which had been smuggled across\r\nfrom England by daring skippers and fishermen. There were several\r\ndespatches from St. Petersburg, containing news of fresh victories in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe Russian army had pushed on to Lucknow without any further engagement\r\nworth mentioning having taken place since the battle of Delhi. It seemed\r\nas if the English were for the time unwilling to meet the enemy in the\r\nopen field. They apparently calculated that the heat and the enormous\r\nlength of their line of communication would prevent the Russians from\r\nreaching the southern provinces in sufficient strength to overcome\r\nan energetic resistance there. But Heideck no longer believed in the\r\npossibility of such a resistance, concluding from the announcement of a\r\nstream of reinforcements arriving through the Khyber Pass that all the\r\nRussian losses would be speedily made up. In his opinion, practically\r\nthe only thing left for the English was to embark the remnants of their\r\narmy at Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, and to get a portion at least of\r\ntheir beaten forces safely out of India.\r\n\r\nWhile he was in his office, despatches were continually arriving from\r\nWilhelmshaven, Kiel, Brest, and Cherbourg. The intelligence department\r\nof the entire north coast was under Heideck’s control.\r\n\r\nExcept for isolated naval engagements, the strategic position had, on\r\nthe whole, remained unaltered for months. Both sides hesitated to risk\r\na decisive battle. The English fleets did not venture to attack the\r\nenemy’s harbours; the combined squadrons of the continental Powers\r\nseemed no more inclined to try their fortune on the open sea. Each was\r\nendeavouring to get in touch with the other, waiting for the favourable\r\nmoment when his adversary’s weakness might offer the prospect of\r\nsuccessful action.\r\n\r\n“The risks these dwellers on the coast run are astonishing,” said one of\r\nHeideck’s staff. “They cross the Channel in their fishing-boats and slip\r\nby the warships. The man who brought the last English papers told me\r\nthat he passed close by them to give the impression that there was\r\nnothing wrong. It needed considerable courage to risk that.”\r\n\r\n“But the enemy’s spies are equally efficient. Yesterday, more by\r\naccident than any merit of my own, I caught a herring fisher in the\r\nmouth of the Schelde who was in English pay; I think I have hit on an\r\napparently important clue, which I intend to follow up in Antwerp, after\r\nreporting myself to the Chancellor.”\r\n\r\n“He is no longer in Flushing. He has left for Antwerp with the Minister\r\nfor War and the chief of the General Staff; I am told he has matters of\r\nimportance to arrange with the chief of the French General Staff.”\r\n\r\n“Have you heard anything more definite as to the nature of these\r\nmatters?”\r\n\r\n“Only that the question of further mobilisation is to be discussed.\r\nApparently, however, the six army corps, which we now have on a war\r\nfooting, are thought to be enough on our side. We are not waging war by\r\nland; why then should the burden of a further mobilisation be imposed\r\nupon the people?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, the sacrifices entailed by this war are enormous without\r\nthat; trade and industry are completely ruined.”\r\n\r\n“The only gainer by this universal conflagration is America. Since the\r\nwar broke out, the United States has supplied England with everything\r\nshe used to get from the Continent.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it will all come right in the end. Now, as there seems nothing\r\nurgent for me to do here, it is time I went to Antwerp.”\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nEberhard Amelungen was unable to conceal his confusion, when an officer\r\nin the uniform of the Prussian General Staff appeared at the door of his\r\nprivate office.\r\n\r\nAmelungen was a man about sixty years of age, a typical specimen of a\r\nsubstantial, respectable merchant.\r\n\r\n“I am somewhat surprised, sir,” he said in measured tones. “What can I\r\ndo for you?”\r\n\r\nHeideck introduced himself, and without wasting words told him the\r\nreason of his visit.\r\n\r\n“I have reason to believe, Herr Amelungen, that you hold in your hands\r\nsome, if not all, of the chief meshes of a widespread net of espionage.\r\nAnd I think it would be to your interest to tell me the whole truth of\r\nyour own accord. We know so much already that presumably it will be of\r\nlittle use to you to have recourse to lies.”\r\n\r\nAmelungen played with his penholder, but his hands trembled visibly, and\r\nwords failed him. His face had turned ashy pale, and Heideck could not\r\nhelp feeling sorry for him.\r\n\r\n“I regret that my duty obliges me to proceed against you,” he continued.\r\n“I can easily understand your motives. You are a Netherlander and a\r\npatriot, and, as perhaps you do not quite understand the political\r\nsituation, the occupation of your country by a foreign power appears to\r\nyou an act of violence, which fills you with anger and hatred against\r\nus. Therefore I think I may promise you that you will be treated as\r\nleniently as possible, if you make my task easy by an open confession.”\r\n\r\nEberhard Amelungen shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I know nothing of what you charge me with,” he said feebly. “You have\r\nthe power, and can do as you please with me. But I have nothing to\r\nconfess.”\r\n\r\n“Not if I tell you that my information comes from the mouth of your own\r\nson?”\r\n\r\nThe merchant stared at the speaker with wide-open eyes full of anxiety.\r\n\r\n“From the mouth of my own son? But--I have no son.”\r\n\r\n“Then M. Camille Penurot also was lying when he said you were his\r\nfather?”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake be merciful! Don’t torture me! What is the matter with\r\nCamille? Where is he?”\r\n\r\n“He has been caught spying. What will happen to him depends on your own\r\nbehaviour.”\r\n\r\nEberhard Amelungen sank back in his stool in a state of collapse.\r\n\r\n“My God! you don’t mean to put him in prison? or to shoot him?”\r\n\r\n“As you may imagine, his fate is not in my hands alone. But in this\r\ninstance my influence may perhaps be considerable, and it would\r\ncertainly have weight if I threw it into the scale in your favour and\r\nhis. Therefore I again ask you to consider whether, as things are, it\r\nwould not be best for you to be perfectly frank with me. Those who are\r\nbehind you can no longer protect you, and your only hope lies in the\r\nleniency of the German authorities. Do not reject the possibility of\r\nsecuring this leniency.”\r\n\r\nThe merchant was evidently carrying on a severe struggle with himself.\r\nAfter a few moments he raised his head, and in an altered, defiant tone\r\nreplied--\r\n\r\n“Do what you like with me, I have nothing to confess.”\r\n\r\nHeideck then assumed a sterner, official demeanour.\r\n\r\n“Then you must not complain if I begin to search your house.”\r\n\r\n“Do as you think fit. The victor can take what liberties he pleases.”\r\n\r\nHeideck opened the door and summoned two of the Berlin criminal police,\r\nwho at his request had been ordered to Antwerp on this affair with a\r\nlarge number of policemen. Certainly he felt sure in advance that they\r\nwould find nothing, for Eberhard Amelungen would have been very foolish\r\nnot to have reckoned long ago on the possibility of such a visit, and\r\nto have taken precautions accordingly. The Major, in bringing the\r\npolice with him, had thought more of the moral impression of the whole\r\nprocedure. His knowledge of men told him that it had its effect.\r\n\r\n“One thing more, Herr Amelungen,” said he. “About the same time as the\r\nsearch begins here, another will take place in your private house. I\r\nexpect the report of those entrusted with it at any moment.”\r\n\r\nAmelungen breathed hard. He looked nervously at Heideck, as if trying\r\nto read his thoughts. Then, after a brief struggle with himself, he\r\nwhispered--\r\n\r\n“Send these men out, Herr major! I should like to speak to you\r\nprivately.”\r\n\r\nWhen Heideck had complied with his request, Amelungen continued,\r\nspeaking hastily, and bringing out his words with difficulty: “In me you\r\nsee a man who deserves compassion, a man who has been, entirely against\r\nhis will and inclination, compromised. If anyone is guilty in\r\nthis matter, it is my brother-in-law Van Spranekhuizen and a lady\r\ncorrespondent of my wife in Brussels. Occasionally I have acted as\r\nagent, when it was a matter of forwarding letters, or of handing over\r\nsums of money to the Countess--to the lady; but I have never personally\r\ntaken any part in the matters in question.”\r\n\r\n“That statement is not enough for me. I do not doubt the truth of what\r\nyou say, but I must be informed of all the details before I can drop\r\nfurther proceedings against you. Who is the lady you speak of?”\r\n\r\n“A former maid of honour to the late Queen.”\r\n\r\n“Her name?”\r\n\r\n“Countess Clementine Arselaarts.”\r\n\r\n“How did you come to know her?”\r\n\r\n“She is a friend of my wife, who made her acquaintance last year when\r\nstaying in Brussels.”\r\n\r\n“And your wife is English?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; her maiden name was Irwin.”\r\n\r\nAt the sound of this name a flood of painful recollections rushed over\r\nHeideck’s mind.\r\n\r\n“Irwin?” he repeated. “Has the lady by chance any relatives in the\r\nBritish army?”\r\n\r\n“I had a brother-in-law, who was a captain in the Indian Lancers. But,\r\naccording to the news that has reached us, he was killed at the battle\r\nof Lahore.”\r\n\r\nThe Major found it hard to control his excitement, but as if he had\r\nalready allowed himself to be too long diverted from his duty, he\r\nhastily returned to the real subject of his examination.\r\n\r\n“You said that you have handed over certain sums of money to Countess\r\nArselaarts. By whose order? and on whose account?”\r\n\r\n“On account of the English Government and on the order of an English\r\nbanking house with which I have had business dealings for many years.”\r\n\r\n“Were the sums large?”\r\n\r\n“Latterly, on an average about 10,000 francs a month.”\r\n\r\n“And how were they paid?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I sent the amount in cash, often by cheque on Brussels\r\nbanks.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any evidence on the point--a receipt signed by the Countess?”\r\n\r\nAmelungen hesitated.\r\n\r\n“I strongly advise you to keep nothing back from me. So much is at stake\r\nfor you and your relatives who are involved in this affair that it is\r\nof the utmost consequence that you should secure lenient treatment by a\r\nfrank confession.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I have some receipts.”\r\n\r\n“Please let me see them.”\r\n\r\nAmelungen pulled open a drawer in his writing-table, pressed a spring,\r\nand a secret compartment at the back flew open.\r\n\r\n“There they are!” said he, handing a small bundle of sheets of paper to\r\nHeideck. But the Major’s keen eye had noticed, as he glanced rapidly at\r\nthe compartment, that it contained some other papers, which he politely\r\nbut firmly demanded to see.\r\n\r\n“They are private letters of no importance,” objected Amelungen, “some\r\nof my wife’s correspondence, which she accidentally left in my office. I\r\ndon’t know what they are about myself.”\r\n\r\n“Be assured that harmless private correspondence will not be abused. But\r\nI must claim the absolute right to convince myself of the correctness of\r\nyour assertions by examining them.”\r\n\r\nThe merchant could see that there was no chance of getting out of it,\r\nand, visibly excited, handed the little roll over to Heideck.\r\n\r\nThe Major took it, without examining the contents more closely at once.\r\n\r\n“You definitely assure me, Herr Amelungen, that you have nothing else\r\nreferring to this matter?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing! I give you my word, Herr major.”\r\n\r\nHeideck got up.\r\n\r\n“I charge you not to attempt to leave the town or in any other way evade\r\nthe German authorities. You will guarantee this not only as regards\r\nyourself, but also as regards your wife; and you will further promise\r\nme to break off at once all relations with the persons involved in this\r\nespionage affair, unless at our order, or in agreement with us.”\r\n\r\nEberhard Amelungen, whose powers of resistance seemed completely broken\r\nin this painful hour, nodded assent.\r\n\r\n“I promise both, Herr major!”\r\n\r\nHeideck, having left a criminal official with instructions to keep\r\nwatch, repaired without delay to the office of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nNollenberg, head of the intelligence department for Antwerp. He informed\r\nhim of the result of his conversation and examined the confiscated\r\npapers in his presence.\r\n\r\nA large number were letters from the Countess Clementine Arselaarts\r\nto Frau Beatrix Amelungen, and their contents were harmless, with the\r\nexception of a few expressions advising watchfulness and despatch.\r\n\r\nBut in a special envelope, sealed several times, there was a sheet of\r\npaper, covered with close writing, which could not be read offhand,\r\nsince the letters were apparently jumbled together quite arbitrarily and\r\nirregularly.\r\n\r\n“A cipher!” said Heideck. “But we shall soon get to the bottom of it.\r\nYou have some capable interpreters at your disposal, and it might be a\r\ngood thing if they set to work at once.”\r\n\r\nHe continued his examination, and suddenly the blood rushed to his\r\nface, for in his hands he held a letter, the handwriting of which\r\nhe recognised at the first glance as Edith’s. Its contents were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“DEAR BEATRICE,--As you see, I am again in England. You know that I\r\nhave returned a widow, and you can believe that my experiences have\r\nbeen terrible. Your brother met an honourable death at Lahore; with the\r\nutmost difficulty I myself succeeded in getting away from India under\r\nthe protection of Attorney-General Kennedy and his family. I should have\r\nto fill a book if I were to tell you all the horrors of our journey.\r\nBut this is not the proper time to complain of the melancholy lot of an\r\nindividual. We are all strangers and pilgrims on earth, and must bear\r\nthe cross that is laid upon us.\r\n\r\n“The immediate reason of my writing to-day is that I want your opinion\r\non a certain matter. When I arrived at my parents’ house, I heard that\r\nuncle Godfrey had died on the 16th of April. I do not know whether you\r\nhave already heard of this, as regular communication with the Continent\r\nis interrupted. My uncle Godfrey has left a will, dividing his property\r\nequally between you as his niece and my deceased husband. His property\r\nwas larger than my husband thought. After division, both you and my\r\nhusband would have had a yearly income of 5,000 pounds. Now your brother\r\nhas died without having disposed of his property. But my lawyer tells me\r\nthat, as his sole heiress, I can claim his share of the inheritance. To\r\narrange about this I have come here to Dover; for I found that I could\r\nonly get the letter forwarded to Antwerp with the assistance of Admiral\r\nHollway, who is charged with the protection of our coast. To my\r\nsurprise the Admiral informed me that your name was known to him, and he\r\nwillingly undertook to forward this letter to you. Now please consent\r\nto uncle Godfrey’s property being divided between you and me. I do not\r\nbelieve you will have any objection, but I consider it a duty to obtain\r\nyour definite consent. I shall be glad to hear from you that you are\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n“Yours truly,\r\n\r\n“EDITH IRWIN.\r\n\r\n“P.S.--In India I made the acquaintance of a German officer who rendered\r\nme great service during the terrible times of the war and saved my\r\nlife more than once. He travelled with the Kennedys and myself on the\r\nCaledonia to Naples. From there he went on to Berlin, while we\r\ncontinued our voyage on a man-of-war through the Straits of Gibraltar to\r\nSouthampton. This officer is a Captain Heideck of the Prussian General\r\nStaff. I should be thankful to you if you would find out where he is at\r\npresent. I am very anxious to know his address. For a time I am staying\r\nin Dover. Letters addressed to Mrs. Jones, 7, St. Paul’s Street, will\r\nreach me.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe perusal of this letter revived a crowd of painful recollections in\r\nHeideck’s mind. He never doubted for a moment that the postscript, in\r\nwhich his name occurred, explained Edith’s real object in writing. All\r\nthe rest was certainly a mere pretext; for he knew how indifferent Edith\r\nwas in regard to money matters, and was convinced that she was in no\r\nsuch hurry about the settlement of the inheritance as might have been\r\nthought from her letter.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Colonel approached him at this moment.\r\n\r\n“It has taken less time to decipher the document than I had ventured to\r\nhope,” said he. “I have telegraphed at once to the police at Schleswig\r\nto arrest the writer, one Brodersen, without delay. Please convince\r\nyourself what sort of friends we have amongst the Danes.”\r\n\r\nHeideck read as follows:--\r\n\r\n“In the harbour of Kiel, the larger warships are the battleships\r\nOldenburg, Baden, Wurttemberg, Bayern, Sachsen; the large cruisers\r\nKaiser, Deutschland, Konig Wilhelm; the small cruisers Gazelle, Prinzess\r\nWilhelm, Irene, Komet, and Meteor, with the torpedo division boats D 5\r\nand D 6 with their divisions. In addition, there are about 100 large and\r\nsmall steamers of the North-German Lloyd, the Hamburg-America Line, the\r\nStettin Company, and others. All the large steamers are equipped with\r\nquick-firing cannon and machine-guns; the small, only with machine-guns.\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Kiel there are 50,000 infantry and artillery\r\nfrom Hanover, Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and the province of Saxony, with\r\nonly two regiments of hussars. My friends’ opinions differ as to the\r\nplans of the German Government. Possibly ships of the line will proceed\r\nthrough the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and make a combined attack with the\r\nRussian fleet on the British near Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n“It is most probable that the fleet of transports will take on board the\r\narmy collected at Kiel and convey it through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal\r\ninto the North Sea, where the German battleships now at Antwerp will\r\njoin the French squadrons from Cherbourg. An attempt would then be made,\r\nunder cover of the warships, to land the German army and the French\r\ntroops from Boulogne at Dover, or some place near on the English coast.\r\n\r\n“I acknowledge the receipt of 10,000 francs from Mynheer van\r\nSpranekhuizen, but must ask you to send a further sum twice that amount.\r\nMy agents are risking their lives, and will not work for less.”\r\n\r\n“You, too, my dear Brodersen, have risked your life,” said the\r\nLieutenant-Colonel seriously. “I should not like to give much for it at\r\nthe present moment.”\r\n\r\n“These notes are very instructive,” observed Heideck. “If we strengthen\r\nAdmiral Hollway in the belief that we intend to land the German troops\r\nin England from Antwerp and not from Kiel, our fleet of transports at\r\nKiel will be able to cross the North Sea all the more safely and effect\r\nthe landing in Scotland.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF A SPY\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Mercier-Milon reported from Brussels that he had arrested\r\nCountess Arselaarts and thought he had made a valuable capture. The\r\nCountess was deeply in debt and lived very extravagantly. A little time\r\nago she had been assisted financially by an exalted personage, who had\r\nleft the country. Since then her resources had become exhausted, and\r\nit was supposed that she had acted as a spy for the English at a high\r\nsalary. He added that he was on the point of discovering a widespread\r\nnetwork of espionage in France and Belgium.\r\n\r\nHerr van Spranekhuizen and Hinnerk Brodersen of Schleswig had also been\r\narrested the same morning.\r\n\r\n“I wish we had trustworthy information as to the strength of the British\r\nfleet,” said the Lieutenant-Colonel, who had communicated the above\r\nreport to Heideck. “Sometimes I am really inclined to believe that this\r\nfleet is not so effective as all the world has hitherto assumed. It\r\nis almost impossible for outsiders to get a clear insight into the\r\ncondition of the English navy. So far as I can remember, false\r\nreports are systematically published about the fleet--officially,\r\nsemi-officially, and privately. From time to time a speaker is put up\r\nin Parliament by the Government to deliver a violent attack on the naval\r\nadministration. He is contradicted by a representative of the Admiralty,\r\nand dust is again thrown in the eyes of the world. On one of Queen\r\nVictoria’s last birthdays a powerful squadron, as it was called, was\r\nassembled for review off Spithead. But no foreigner was allowed a close\r\ninspection of these imposing fleets, and I am greatly inclined to think\r\nthat it was another case of the famous movable villages, which Potemkin\r\nshowed the Russian Empress on her journey to the Crimea. Official\r\nstatements give the number of English warships as more than four\r\nhundred, not including torpedo-boats, but amongst them is a large number\r\nof obsolete and inefficient vessels.”\r\n\r\nHeideck nodded.\r\n\r\n“If the English fleet were really so efficient as is believed, it would\r\nbe difficult to understand why it has not attempted any decisive action\r\nup till now.”\r\n\r\n“That is also my view. The Copenhagen fleet would have attacked Kiel\r\nharbour long ago. It was said that it was to hold the Russian fleet in\r\ncheck. But that would be superfluous to start with, as long as the Gulfs\r\nof Bothnia and Finland were blocked with ice and the Russian squadrons\r\nwere unable to move. This way of making war reminds me forcibly of the\r\nstate of things in the Crimean War, when a powerful English fleet\r\nset out with a great flourish of trumpets against Cronstadt and St.\r\nPetersburg, but did nothing except bombard Bomarsund, a place nobody\r\ncared about. The English Press had great difficulty in excusing the\r\nfiasco of its world-renowned fleet.”\r\n\r\nReturning to the previous subject of conversation, Heideck said to the\r\nLieutenant-Colonel: “I don’t think we need trouble ourselves any more\r\nabout the communications of Countess Arselaarts and Messrs. Amelungen\r\nand Co. The court-martial may settle with them. I attach incomparably\r\ngreater importance to skipper Brandelaar, whom I hold in my hand, and\r\nthrough whom--perhaps with the help of Camille Penurot--I hope to\r\nobtain information about the British fleet and its proposed employment.\r\nBrandelaar’s vessel should now be off Ternenzen. I will ask you, Herr\r\nLieutenant-Colonel, to have the man and his crew arrested to-day.”\r\n\r\n“But how does that agree with your intention of using him as a spy in\r\nour interest?”\r\n\r\n“I forgot to tell you that it is an agreement between Brandelaar and\r\nmyself. He himself thought it necessary for his own safety; he was\r\nafraid of the crew. Of course it will only be a sham examination,\r\nand the man must be released as soon as possible, on the ground of\r\ninsufficient evidence, so that he can return to England to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Colonel promised to do as the Major desired.\r\n\r\nThe same evening Heideck met Penurot by arrangement at a tavern.\r\n\r\n“Our business is somewhat complicated,” said Heideck. “There must be\r\nsome more people working for your father, hitherto unknown to us.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you think that, Herr major?”\r\n\r\n“Your father had some letters from Admiral Hollway, which were not\r\nbrought by Brandelaar.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I know. I can imagine that.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know who brought them over?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know for certain, but I can guess.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you get me more certain information?”\r\n\r\n“I will try.”\r\n\r\n“How will you set about it?”\r\n\r\n“There are some sailors’ taverns here, where I hope to get on the track.\r\nBut they are desperate fellows, and it is dangerous to meddle with\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“If you will point out the taverns to me, I will have all the customers\r\narrested to-night.”\r\n\r\n“For Heaven’s sake, don’t, Herr major! We should ruin everything by\r\nthat. These men would let themselves be cut to pieces rather than betray\r\nanything to you. If anyone can get them to speak, it is myself.”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t you be trusting them too much?”\r\n\r\n“No, no. I know best how to deal with them, and I know many ways of\r\nmaking them open their mouths.”\r\n\r\n“Well, do what you can. The matter is important. I am very anxious to\r\nfind someone to obtain trustworthy information about the British fleet,\r\nand you know we don’t spare money.”\r\n\r\nPenurot was ready to attempt his difficult task at once, and took\r\nleave of Heideck, promising to meet him soon after midnight at the same\r\ntavern. Heideck left the restaurant soon after him, and walked along\r\nthe quay Van Dyck, to cool his heated brow. In time of war the town\r\npresented a strangely altered appearance. There was a swarm of German\r\nsoldiers in the streets; the usual busy traffic at the harbour had\r\nentirely ceased. There had been no trade since the German warships, like\r\nfloating citadels, had been lying in the Schelde. And yet it was almost\r\nincomprehensible, how the change had come about so rapidly. Antwerp\r\nwas an almost impregnable fortress, if the flooding of the surrounding\r\ncountry was undertaken in time. But the Belgian Government had not even\r\nmade an attempt at defence, when the vanguard of the seventh and\r\neighth army corps had appeared in the neighbourhood of the town. It had\r\nsurrendered the fortress at once, with all its strong outer forts,\r\nto the German military commanders and had withdrawn its own army. The\r\nImperial Chancellor was certainly right in attaching such importance\r\nto the possession of Antwerp by Germany. The population was almost\r\nexclusively Flemish, and Antwerp was thus in nationality a German town.\r\n\r\nFrom the general political situation Heideck’s thoughts returned to\r\nEdith and her letter, and at last he decided to write to her that very\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nTo carry out his intention, he went back to the restaurant where he\r\nhad met Penurot, and called for ink and paper. When he had finished his\r\nletter, he looked over the words he had written, in which, contrary to\r\nhis usual practice, he had given utterance to his real feelings:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“MY DEAR EDITH,--In the exercise of my duty, I accidentally came into\r\npossession of your letter to Frau Amelungen. I was looking for something\r\nquite different at the time, and you can imagine how great was my\r\nsurprise at the unexpected discovery.\r\n\r\n“From the hour when we were obliged to separate and you, possibly not\r\nwithout resentment and reproach, held out your hand at parting, I have\r\nfelt more and more how indispensable you are to me. I treasure every\r\nword you have said to me, every look you have bestowed upon me, and\r\nyour image is before my mind, ever brighter, ever more beautiful. I have\r\nnever met a woman whose mind was so beautiful, so refined, so keen as\r\nyours. I must confess that your ideas at first sometimes terrified me.\r\nYour views are often so far removed from the commonplace, so far above\r\nthe ordinary, that it needs time to estimate them correctly. If I now\r\nrecall to mind what formerly seemed strange to me, it is only with\r\nfeelings of admiration. From day to day the impression you made upon\r\nme at our first conversation has sunk deeper into my mind, and the\r\ncomforting certainty, that love for you will fill my entire life in the\r\nfuture, grows more and more unshakable.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, I may not regret that I had the strength to leave you\r\nat Naples. The beautiful dream of our life together would have been\r\ndisturbed too soon by the rude reality. My duty calls me from one place\r\nto another, and as long as this war lasts I am not my own master for an\r\nhour. We must have patience, Edith. Even this campaign cannot last for\r\never, and if Heaven has decreed that I shall come out of it alive, we\r\nshall meet again, never more to part.\r\n\r\n“You may not be able to answer this letter, for communication with\r\nFrau Amelungen is interrupted. But I know you will answer me if it is\r\npossible, and I am happy to think that, by letting you know I am alive,\r\nI have given you a pleasure, soon, I hope, to be followed by the\r\nstill greater happiness of meeting again. Let us wait patiently and\r\nconfidently for that hour!”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sealed the letter and put it in his pocket, in order to hand it over\r\nto Brandelaar on the following day. He then waited for the reappearance\r\nof Penurot, who had promised to be back at midnight. But although he\r\nwaited nearly an hour over the time in the tavern, he waited in vain.\r\nThe terms in which Herr Amelungen’s natural son had spoken of the people\r\nhe intended to look for that evening made the Major anxious about his\r\nfate. Before returning to his quarters, he paid a visit to the town\r\npolice office, requesting that a search might be made in the less\r\nreputable sailors’ taverns near the harbour for M. Camille Penurot, of\r\nwhose appearance he gave a careful description.\r\n\r\nAs there was no news of him on the following morning, Heideck felt\r\nalmost certain that the affair had turned out disastrously for Penurot.\r\nHowever, for the moment, he could not stop to investigate the young\r\nman’s whereabouts.\r\n\r\nHe was informed by the Lieutenant-Colonel that Brandelaar, whose vessel\r\nactually lay off Ternenzen, had been arrested with his crew, examined,\r\nand liberated during the course of the night, as had been agreed between\r\nthe two officers.\r\n\r\nHeideck now set out for Ternenzen to give Brandelaar the information for\r\nAdmiral Hollway that had been collected at his office, together with the\r\nprivate information that was of such importance to him.\r\n\r\nAt last, having paid Brandelaar a thousand francs on account, Heideck\r\nalso gave him the letter to Edith, with careful instructions as to\r\nits delivery. The skipper, whose zeal for the cause of Germany was now\r\nundoubtedly honourable, repeatedly promised to carry out his orders\r\nconscientiously and to the best of his power.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Antwerp at noon, Heideck found a communication at his\r\noffice from the police to the effect that Camille Penurot’s body had\r\nbeen found in one of the harbour basins, stabbed in several places in\r\nthe breast and neck. A search for the assassins had been immediately set\r\non foot, but up to the present no trace of them had been discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nA WOMAN’S TREACHERY\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the agreement with Heideck, Brandelaar, on his return\r\nfrom Dover, was to put in at Flushing, and the Major had instructed the\r\nguardships at the mouth of the West Schelde to allow the smack to pass\r\nunmolested without detention. But he waited for the skipper from day\r\nto day in vain. The weather could not have been the cause of his delay;\r\ncertainly it had not been too bad for a man of Brandelaar’s daring. A\r\nmoderate north wind had been blowing nearly the whole time, so that a\r\nclever sailor could have easily made the passage from Dover to Flushing\r\nin a day.\r\n\r\nConsequently, other reasons must have kept him in England. Heideck began\r\nto fear that either his knowledge of men, so often tried, had deceived\r\nhim on this occasion, or that Brandelaar had fallen a victim to some act\r\nof imprudence in England.\r\n\r\nA whole week having passed since Brandelaar had started, Heideck at\r\nleast hoped for his return to-day. The north wind had increased towards\r\nevening; there was almost a storm, and the blast rattled violently at\r\nthe windows of the room in the hotel, in which Heideck sat still writing\r\nat midnight.\r\n\r\nA gentle knock at the door made him look up from his work. Who could\r\nhave come to see him at this late hour? It was certainly not an orderly\r\nfrom his office, which was open day and night, for soldiers’ fingers as\r\na rule knocked harder.\r\n\r\n“Come in!” he said. The door opened slowly, and Heideck saw, in the\r\ndimly-lighted corridor, a slender form in a long oilskin cape and\r\na large sailor’s hat, the brim of which was pressed down over the\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nA wild idea flashed through Heideck’s mind. He sprang up, and at the\r\nsame moment the pretended young man tore off his hat and held out his\r\narms with a cry of joy.\r\n\r\n“My dear--my beloved friend!”\r\n\r\n“Edith!”\r\n\r\nAt this moment all other thoughts and feelings were forgotten by Heideck\r\nin the overpowering joy of seeing her again. He rushed to Edith and\r\ndrew her to his breast. For a long time they remained silent in a\r\nlong embrace, looking into each other’s eyes and laughing like merry\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAt last, slowly freeing herself from his arms, Edith said--\r\n\r\n“You are not angry with me, then, for coming to you, although you\r\nforbade it? You will not send me away from you again?”\r\n\r\nHer voice penetrated his ear like sweet, soothing music. What man could\r\nhave resisted that seductive voice?\r\n\r\n“I should like to be angry with you, my dear, but I cannot--Heaven knows\r\nI cannot!”\r\n\r\n“I could not have lived any longer without you,” whispered the young\r\nwoman. “I was obliged to see you again, or I should have died of\r\nlonging.”\r\n\r\n“My sweet, my only love! But what is the meaning of this disguise? And\r\nhow did you manage to cross the Channel?”\r\n\r\n“I took the way you showed me. And is my disguise so very displeasing to\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nShe had thrown off the ugly, disfiguring cape and stood before him in\r\na dark blue sailor’s dress. Even in her dress as an Indian rajah he had\r\nnot thought her more enchanting.\r\n\r\n“The only thing that displeases me is that other eyes than mine have\r\nbeen allowed to see you in it. But you still owe me an explanation how\r\nyou got here?”\r\n\r\n“With your messenger of love, your postillon d’amour, who was certainly\r\nrather uncouth and awkward for so delicate a mission.”\r\n\r\n“What! did you come with Brandelaar?” cried Heideck, in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes. The moment I received your letter from his clumsy sailor’s fist,\r\nmy mind was made up. I asked him whether he was returning to Flushing,\r\nand when he said yes, I declared he must take me with him, cost what\r\nit would. I would have paid him all I possessed, without hesitation, to\r\ntake me across. But the good fellow did it for much less.”\r\n\r\n“You foolish girl!” said Heideck reprovingly. But pride in his\r\nbeautiful, fearless darling shone brightly from his eyes. “I shall have\r\nto take Brandelaar seriously to task for playing so reckless a game. But\r\nwhat made him so long in returning?”\r\n\r\n“I believe he had all kinds of private business to see after. And he was\r\nnot the only one--I had my business too. I did not want to come to you\r\nempty-handed, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“Empty-handed? I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“I puzzled my brains how I could please you, and appease your anger at\r\nmy sudden appearance--that terrible anger, of which I felt so afraid.\r\nAnd as I heard from Brandelaar that it is your duty to discover military\r\nsecrets--”\r\n\r\n“The worthy Brandelaar is a chatterer. It seems as if your beautiful\r\neyes have tempted him to open his whole heart to you.”\r\n\r\n“And if it had been the case,” she asked, with a roguish smile, “would\r\nyou not have every reason to be grateful to him as well as myself? But\r\nreally--you don’t even know what I have brought for you. Aren’t you the\r\nleast curious?”\r\n\r\n“No military secret, I suppose?”\r\n\r\nHe spoke jestingly, but she nodded seriously.\r\n\r\n“Yes--a great secret. Chance helped me, or I should hardly have got hold\r\nof it. There it is! But be sure I shall claim an adequate reward for\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nShe handed him a sealed envelope, which she had kept concealed under her\r\ndress. When Heideck, with growing excitement, spread out the paper it\r\ncontained, he recognised at the first glance the blue stamped paper of\r\nthe English Admiralty.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he read the first lines than he started up in the most\r\nviolent excitement. His face had become dark red, a deep furrow showed\r\nitself between his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“What is this?” he ejaculated. “For God’s sake, Edith, how did you come\r\nby this paper?”\r\n\r\n“How did I come by it? Oh, that’s quite a secondary consideration. The\r\nchief thing is, whether it is of any value to you or not. But aren’t you\r\npleased with it?”\r\n\r\nHeideck was still staring like one hypnotised at the paper covered with\r\nthe regularly formed writing of a practised clerk’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Incomprehensible!” he murmured. Then, suddenly looking at Edith almost\r\nthreateningly, he repeated--\r\n\r\n“How did you come by it?”\r\n\r\n“You are questioning me like a magistrate. But you may know, for all\r\nI care. The brother of the lady with whom I was staying in Dover is\r\nprivate secretary to the Admiralty--a poor fellow, suffering from\r\ndisease of the lungs, whose one desire was to go to Egypt or Madeira, to\r\nget relief from his sufferings. By finding him the means for this I\r\nhave done an act of philanthrophy. I asked him, in return for a further\r\npresent of money, to give me the copy of an important document connected\r\nwith his department.”\r\n\r\nShe suddenly broke off, and Heideck burst out into a short, sharp laugh\r\nwhich filled her with surprise and alarm.\r\n\r\n“An act of philanthrophy!” he repeated in a tone of unspeakable\r\nbitterness. “Did you know what this man was selling to you?”\r\n\r\n“He said it was the English fleet’s plan of attack, and I thought it\r\nwould interest you.”\r\n\r\n“But surely you must have known how far-reaching would be the\r\nconsequences of your act? Had you no suspicion that irreparable harm\r\nmight overtake your country, if this plan came to the knowledge of its\r\nenemies?”\r\n\r\nHis voice quivered with fearful anxiety, but Edith did not seem to\r\nunderstand his excitement.\r\n\r\n“I understand you less and less,” she said impatiently. “It can only be\r\none of two things. Either this paper is of importance to you, and then\r\nyou ought to feel the more grateful to me, the more important it is. Or\r\nthe secretary has deceived me as to its value. Then it isn’t worth the\r\ntrouble of saying any more about it.”\r\n\r\n“Do you look at it in that light, Edith?” he said, mournfully. “Only in\r\nthat light? Did you only think of yourself and me, when you bribed an\r\nunfortunate wretch to commit the most disgraceful of all crimes?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dearest, what strong language! I was not prepared for such\r\nreproaches. Certainly I was only thinking of you and me, and I am not\r\nin the least ashamed to confess it, for there is nothing in the world of\r\nmore importance for me than our love.”\r\n\r\n“And your country, Edith? is that of no account?”\r\n\r\n“My country--what is it? A piece of earth with stones, trees, animals,\r\nand men who are nothing to me, to whom I owe nothing and am indebted for\r\nnothing. Why should I love them more than the inhabitants of any other\r\nregion, amongst whom there are just as many good and bad people as\r\namongst them? I am an Englishwoman: well, but I am also a Christian.\r\nAnd who would have the right to condemn me, if the commandments of\r\nChristianity were more sacred to me than all narrow-minded, national\r\nconsiderations? If the possession of this paper really made you the\r\nstronger--if it should bring defeat upon England, instead of the\r\nhoped-for victory which would only endlessly prolong the war--what would\r\nmankind lose thereby? Perhaps peace would be the sooner concluded, and,\r\njustly proud of my act, I would then confess before all the world.”\r\n\r\nHeideck had not interrupted her, but she saw that her words had not\r\nconvinced him. With gloomy countenance he stood before her, breathing\r\nhard, like one whose heart is oppressed by a heavy burden.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, but I cannot follow your train of thought,” said he, with\r\na melancholy shake of the head. “There are things which cannot be\r\nextenuated however we may try to palliate them.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, if you think what I have done so monstrous, what is there\r\nto prevent us from undoing it? Give me back the paper; I will tear it\r\nup. Then no one will be injured by my treachery.”\r\n\r\n“It is too late for that. Now that I know what this paper contains,\r\nmy sense of duty as an officer commands me to make use of it. You have\r\ninvolved me in a fearful struggle with myself.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, is that your logic? Your sense of honour does not forbid you to\r\nreap the fruits of my treachery, but you punish the traitress with the\r\nfull weight of your contempt.”\r\n\r\nHe avoided meeting her flaming eyes.\r\n\r\n“I did not say I despised you, but--”\r\n\r\n“Well, what else do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Once again--I do not despise you, but it terrifies me to find what you\r\nare capable of.”\r\n\r\n“Is not that the same thing in other words? A man cannot love a woman\r\nif he is terrified at her conduct. Tell me straight out that you can no\r\nlonger love me.”\r\n\r\n“It would be a lie if I said so, Edith. You have killed our happiness,\r\nbut not my love.”\r\n\r\nShe only heard the last words of his answer, and with brightening eyes\r\nflung herself on his breast.\r\n\r\n“Then scold me as you like, you martinet! I will put up with anything\r\npatiently, if only I know that you still love me, and that you will be\r\nmine, all mine, as soon as this terrible war no longer stands between us\r\nlike a frightful spectre.”\r\n\r\nHe did not return her caresses, and gently pushed her from him.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, if I must leave you now,” he said in a singularly depressed\r\nvoice, “but I must be in Antwerp by daybreak.”\r\n\r\n“Is it really so urgent? May I not go with you?”\r\n\r\n“No, that is impossible, for I shall have to travel on an engine.”\r\n\r\n“And when will you return?”\r\n\r\nHeideck turned away his face.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Perhaps I shall be sent on further, so that I shall have\r\nno opportunity of saying good-bye to you.”\r\n\r\n“In other words, you don’t mean to see me again? You are silent. You\r\ncannot have the heart to deceive me. Must I remind you that you have\r\nsworn to belong to me, if you survive this war?”\r\n\r\n“If I survive it--yes!”\r\n\r\nThe tone of his reply struck her like a blow. She had no need to look at\r\nhim again, to know what was passing in his mind. Now for the first\r\ntime she understood that there was no further hope for her. Heideck had\r\nspoken the truth, when he said he still loved her, and the horror which\r\nhe felt at her conduct did not, according to his conscience, release him\r\nfrom his word. But as he at the same time felt absolutely certain that\r\nhe could never make a traitress to her country his wife, his idea of\r\nthe honour of a man and officer drove him to the only course which could\r\nextricate him from this fearful conflict of duties.\r\n\r\nHe had sworn to marry her, if he survived the war. And since he could no\r\nmore keep his oath than break it, he had at this moment decided to put\r\nan end to the struggle by seeking death, which his calling made it so\r\neasy for him to find. With the keen insight of a woman in love Edith\r\nread his mind like an open book. She knew him so well that she never for\r\na moment cherished the illusion that she could alter his mind by prayers\r\nor tears. She knew that this man was ready to sacrifice everything for\r\nher--everything save honour. Her mind had never been fuller of humble\r\nadmiration than at the moment when the knowledge that she had lost him\r\nfor ever spread a dark veil over all her sunny hopes of the future.\r\n\r\nShe did not say a word; and when her silence caused him to turn his\r\nface again towards her, she saw an expression of unutterable pain in\r\nhis features, usually so well controlled. Then she also felt the growing\r\npower of a great and courageous resolution. Her mind rose from the low\r\nlevel of selfish passion to the height of self-sacrificing renunciation.\r\nBut it had never been her way to do by halves what she had once\r\ndetermined to carry out. What was to be done admitted no cowardly delay,\r\nno tender leave-taking must allow Heideck to guess that a knowledge of\r\nhis intentions had decided her course of action.\r\n\r\nWith that heroic self-command of which, perhaps, only a woman is capable\r\nin such circumstances, she forced herself to appear outwardly calm and\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\n“Then I am no longer anxious about our future, my friend,” she said\r\nafter a long silence, smiling painfully. “I will not detain you any\r\nlonger now; for I know that your duties as a soldier must stand first. I\r\nam happy that I have been permitted to see you again. Not to hinder your\r\ndoing your duty in this serious time of war, I give you your freedom.\r\nPerhaps your love will some day bring you back to me of your own accord.\r\nAnd now, farewell.”\r\n\r\nHer sudden resolution and the calmness with which she resigned herself\r\nto this second separation must have seemed almost incomprehensible to\r\nHeideck after what had passed. But her beautiful face betrayed so little\r\nof the desperate hopelessness she felt, that, after a brief hesitation,\r\nhe regarded this singular change in the same light as the numerous other\r\nsurprises to which her mysterious nature had already treated him. She\r\nhad spoken with such quiet firmness, that he could no longer look upon\r\nher resolution as the suggestion of a perverse or angry whim.\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, Edith, what do you intend to do?”\r\n\r\n“I shall try to return to Dover to-morrow. I should only be in your way\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, we should not see each other again before you leave?”\r\n\r\n“You said yourself that there was little chance of that.”\r\n\r\n“I am not my own master, and this information--”\r\n\r\n“No excuse is necessary; no regard for me should hinder you in the\r\nperformance of your official duties. Once again then, good-bye, my dear,\r\nmy beloved friend! May Heaven protect you!”\r\n\r\nShe flung herself on his breast and kissed him; but only for a few\r\nseconds did her soft arm linger round his neck. She did not wish to give\r\nway, and yet she felt that she would not be able to control herself\r\nmuch longer. She hurriedly picked up her oilskin cape from the floor and\r\nseized her fisherman’s hat. Heideck fervently desired to say something\r\naffectionate and tender, but his throat seemed choked as it were by an\r\ninvisible hand; he could only utter, in a voice that sounded cold and\r\ndry, the words, “Farewell, my love! farewell!”\r\n\r\nWhen he heard the door close behind her, he started up impetuously, as\r\nif he meant to rush after her and call her back. But after the first\r\nstep he stood still and pressed his clenched left hand upon his\r\nviolently beating heart. His face, as if turned to stone, wore an\r\nexpression of inflexible resolution, and the corners of his mouth were\r\nmarked by two deep, sharp lines, as if within this single hour he had\r\naged ten years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nEDITH’S LAST JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nSkipper Brandelaar had given Edith the name of the inn near the harbour,\r\nwhere he expected a message from Heideck in the course of the night; for\r\nhe felt certain that the Major would be anxious to speak to him as soon\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nBut he was considerably surprised when, instead of the messenger he\r\nexpected, he saw his beautiful disguised passenger enter the low,\r\nsmoke-begrimed taproom. He went to meet Edith with a certain clumsy\r\ngallantry, to shield her from the curiosity and importunities of the\r\nmen seated with him at the table, whose weatherbeaten faces inspired as\r\nlittle confidence as their clothing, which smelt of tar and had suffered\r\nbadly from wind and weather.\r\n\r\nUtterly surprised, he was going to question Edith, but she anticipated\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“I must get back to Dover to-night,” she said hurriedly, in a low tone.\r\n“Will you take me across? I will pay you what you ask.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper shook his head slowly, but resolutely.\r\n\r\n“Impossible. Even if I could leave again, it couldn’t be done in such\r\nweather.”\r\n\r\n“It must be done. The weather is not so bad, and I know you are not the\r\nman to be afraid of a storm.”\r\n\r\n“Afraid--no! Very likely I have weathered a worse storm than this with\r\nmy smack. But there is a difference between the danger a man has to go\r\nthrough when he cannot escape it, and that to which he foolishly exposes\r\nhimself. When I am on a journey, then come what pleases God, but--”\r\n\r\n“No more, Brandelaar,” interrupted Edith impatiently. “If you cannot, or\r\nwill not go yourself, surely one of your acquaintances here is brave and\r\nsmart enough to earn a couple of hundred pounds without any difficulty.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper’s little eyes twinkled.\r\n\r\n“A couple of hundred pounds? Is it really so important for you to leave\r\nFlushing to-day? We have hardly landed!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is very important. And I have already told you that I don’t\r\ncare how much it costs.”\r\n\r\nThe skipper, who had evidently begun to waver, rubbed his chin\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“H’m! Anyhow, I couldn’t do it myself. I have important information for\r\nthe Herr major, and he would have a right to blame me, if I went away\r\nwithout even so much as speaking to him. But perhaps--perhaps I\r\nmight find out a skipper who would take the risk, provided that I got\r\nsomething out of it for myself.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course! I don’t want a favour from you for nothing. You\r\nshall have fifty pounds the moment I set foot in the boat.”\r\n\r\n“Good! And two hundred for the skipper and his men? The men are risking\r\ntheir lives, you mustn’t forget that. Besides, they will have to manage\r\nconfoundedly cleverly to get past the German guardships unnoticed.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes! Why waste so much time over this useless bargaining? Here is\r\nthe money--now get me a boat.”\r\n\r\n“Go in there,” said Brandelaar, pointing to the door of a little dark\r\nside room. “I will see whether my friend Van dem Bosch will do it.”\r\n\r\nBefore complying with Brandelaar’s suggestion, Edith glanced at the\r\nman whom he had indicated with a movement of his head. Externally\r\nthis robust old sea-dog was certainly not attractive, but his alarming\r\nappearance did not make Edith falter in her resolution for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Good--talk to your friend, Brandelaar! And mind that I don’t have to\r\nwait too long for his consent.”\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe gallant Brandelaar must have found a very effective means of\r\npersuasion, for in less than ten minutes he was able to inform Edith\r\nthat Van dem Bosch was ready to risk the journey on the terms offered.\r\nHe said nothing more about the danger of the undertaking, as if he\r\nwere afraid of frightening the young Englishwoman from her plan, so\r\nprofitable to himself. From this moment nothing more was said about the\r\nmatter. It was not far to the place where the cutter lay at anchor,\r\nand Edith struggled on bravely between the two men, who silently walked\r\nalong by her side, in the face of the hurricane from the north, roaring\r\nin fitful gusts from the sea. They rowed across to the vessel in a yawl,\r\nand when Brandelaar returned to the quay he had his fifty pounds all\r\nright in his pocket.\r\n\r\n“If the Herr major asks after me, you may tell him the whole truth with\r\nconfidence,” Edith had said to him. “And greet him from me--greet him\r\nheartily. Don’t forget that, Brandelaar.”\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe skipper’s two men, who had been lying fast asleep below deck in the\r\ncutter, were considerably astonished and certainly far from pleased at\r\nthe idea of the nocturnal passage. But a few words from the skipper in a\r\nlanguage unintelligible to Edith speedily removed their discontent.\r\nThey now readily set to work to set sail and weigh anchor. The skipper’s\r\npowerful hands grasped the helm; the small, strongly-built vessel tacked\r\na little and then, heeling over, shot out into the darkness.\r\n\r\nIt passed close by the Gefion, and had it by accident been shown up\r\nby the electric light which from time to time searched the disturbed\r\nsurface of the water, the nocturnal trip would in any case have\r\nexperienced a very disagreeable interruption. But chance favoured\r\nthe rash undertaking. No signal was made, no shout raised from the\r\nguardship, and the lights of Flushing were soon lost in the darkness.\r\n\r\nSince the start Edith had been standing by the mast, looking fixedly\r\nbackwards to the place where she was leaving everything which had\r\nhitherto given all its value and meaning to her life. The skipper and\r\nhis two men, whom the varying winds kept fully occupied with their\r\nsails, did not seem to trouble about her, and it was not till a suddenly\r\nviolent squall came on that Van dem Bosch shouted to her that she had\r\nbetter go below, where she would at least be protected against the wind\r\nand weather.\r\n\r\nBut Edith did not stir. For her mind, racked by all the torments\r\nof infinite despair, the raging of the storm, the noise of the rain\r\nrattling down, and the hissing splash of the waves as they dashed\r\nagainst the planks of the boat, made just the right music. The tumult\r\nof the night around her harmonised so exactly with the tumult within her\r\nthat she almost felt it a relief. The close confinement of a low cabin\r\nwould have been unbearable. She could only hold out by drinking in\r\ndeep draughts of air saturated with the briny odour of the sea, and by\r\nexposing her face to the storm, the rain, and the foam of the waves. It\r\nwas a kind of physical struggle with the brute forces of Nature, and\r\nits stirring effect upon her nerves acted as a tonic to a mind lacerated\r\nwith sorrow.\r\n\r\nShe had no thought for time or space. Only the hurricane-like rising\r\nof the storm, the increasingly violent breaking of the waves, and the\r\nwilder rocking of the boat, told her that she must be on the open sea.\r\nIn spite of her oilskin cape, she was completely wet through, and a\r\nchill, which gradually spread over her whole body from below, numbed her\r\nlimbs. Nevertheless, she never for a moment thought of retiring below.\r\nShe had no idea of danger. She heard the sailors cursing, and twice the\r\nskipper’s voice struck her ears, uttering what seemed to be an imperious\r\ncommand. But she did not trouble herself about this. As if already set\r\nfree from everything earthly, she remained completely indifferent to\r\neverything that was going on around her. The more insensible her body\r\nbecame, paralysed by the penetrating damp and chill, the more indefinite\r\nand dreamlike became all the impressions of her senses. She seemed to\r\nhave lost all foothold, to be flying on the wings of the storm, free\r\nfrom all restrictions of corporeal gravity, through unlimited space. All\r\nthe rushing, howling, rattling, and splashing of the unchained elements\r\nseemed to her to unite in one monotonous, majestic roar, which had no\r\nterrors for her, but a wonderfully soothing influence. As her senses\r\nslowly failed, the tumult became a lofty harmony; she felt so entirely\r\none with mighty, all-powerful Nature that the last feeling of which she\r\nwas conscious was a fervent, ardent longing to dissolve in this mighty\r\nNature, like one of the innumerable waves, whose foam wetted her feet in\r\npassing.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nA loud sound, like the sharp report of a gun, was heard above the\r\nconfusion of noises--a loud crash--some wild curses from rough sailors’\r\nthroats! The boat suddenly danced and tossed upon the waves like a piece\r\nof cork, while the big sail flapped in the wind as if it would be torn\r\nthe next minute into a thousand pieces.\r\n\r\nThe peak-halyard was broken, and the gaff, deprived of its hold, struck\r\nwith fearful force downwards. With all the might of his arms, strong as\r\nthose of a giant, the skipper pulled at the helm to bring the vessel to\r\nthe wind. The two other men worked desperately to make the sail fast.\r\n\r\nIn these moments of supreme danger none of the three gave a thought\r\nto the disguised woman in the oilskin cape, who had stood so long\r\nmotionless as a statue by the mast. Not till their difficult task was\r\nsuccessfully finished did they notice that she had disappeared. They\r\nlooked at each other with troubled faces. The skipper at the helm said--\r\n\r\n“She has gone overboard. The gaff must have hit her on the head. There\r\nis no more to be done. Why would she stay on deck?”\r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat and spat into the sea, after the fashion of\r\nsailors.\r\n\r\nThe other two said nothing. Silently they obeyed the orders of the\r\nskipper, who made for the mouth of the Schelde again.\r\n\r\nThey made no attempt to save her. It would have been a useless task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\nTHE STOLEN DOCUMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last ordinary train to Antwerp had gone long before Heideck reached\r\nthe station. But a short interview with the railway commissioner\r\nsufficed, and an engine was at once placed at the Major’s disposal.\r\nWhen he had mounted to the stoker’s place the station-master saluted and\r\nsignalled to the driver to start. For a moment Heideck felt a sharp pain\r\nin his heart like a knife when the grinding engine started. It was\r\nhis life’s happiness that he was leaving behind him for ever. A dull,\r\nparalysing melancholy possessed his soul. He seemed to himself to be\r\na piece of lifeless mechanism, like the engine puffing ceaselessly\r\nonwards, subject and blindly obedient to the will of another. All\r\nhis actions were decided, no longer by his own resolutions, but by\r\nan inexorable, higher law--by the iron law of duty. He was no longer\r\npersonally free nor personally responsible. The way was marked out for\r\nhim as clearly and distinctly as the course of the engine by the iron\r\nlines of rails. With tightly compressed lips he looked fixedly before\r\nhim. What lay behind was no longer any concern of his. Only a peremptory\r\n“Forward” must henceforth be his watchword.\r\n\r\nAbout six o’clock in the morning he stood before the royal castle on\r\nthe Place de Meix, where the Prince-Admiral had fixed his quarters, King\r\nLeopold having offered him the castle to reside in.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the early hour Heideck was at once conducted to the Prince’s\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n“Your Royal Highness,” said Heideck, “I have a report of the utmost\r\nimportance to make. These orders of the English Admiralty have fallen\r\ninto my hands.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince motioned him to a seat by his desk. “Be good enough to read\r\nthe orders to me, Herr major.”\r\n\r\nHeideck read the important document, which ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n“The Lords of the Admiralty think it desirable to attack the German\r\nfleet first, as being the weaker. This attack must be carried out before\r\nthe Russian fleet is in a position to go to its assistance in Kiel\r\nharbour. Therefore a simultaneous attack should be made on the two\r\npositions of the German fleet on the 15th of July.”\r\n\r\n“On the 15th of July?” repeated the Prince, who had risen in great\r\nexcitement. “And it is the 11th to-day! How did you get possession of\r\nthese orders, Herr major? What proof have you that this document is\r\ngenuine?”\r\n\r\n“I have the most convincing reasons for believing it genuine, your Royal\r\nHighness. You can see for yourself that the orders are written on the\r\nblue stamped paper of the English Admiralty.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Herr major! But that would not exclude the idea of a\r\nforgery. How did you come into possession of this paper?”\r\n\r\n“Your Royal Highness will excuse my entering into an explanation.”\r\n\r\n“Then read on.”\r\n\r\nHeideck continued--\r\n\r\n“On the day mentioned the Copenhagen fleet has to attack Kiel harbour.\r\nTwo battleships will take up a position before the fortress of\r\nFriedrichsort and Fort Falkenstein on the west side, two more before\r\nthe fortifications of Labo and Moltenort on the east side of Kiel inlet;\r\nthey will keep up so hot a fire on the fortifications that the rest\r\nof the fleet will be able to enter the harbour behind them under their\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n“In the harbour of Kiel there are about a hundred transports and some\r\nolder ironclads and cruisers, which cannot offer a serious resistance to\r\nour fleet. All these ships must be attacked with the greatest rapidity\r\nand vigour. It is of the utmost importance to send a battleship to the\r\nentrance of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, in order to cut off the retreat\r\nof the German ships. All the German ships in the harbour are to be\r\ndestroyed. The attack is to be commenced by some cruisers from the\r\nrest of the fleet, which will enter the inlet in advance, without any\r\nconsideration of the chance of their being blown up by mines. These\r\nvessels are to be sacrificed, if necessary, in order to set the entrance\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n“For the attack on the German fleet in the Schelde, which must also take\r\nplace on the 15th of July, Vice-Admiral Domvile will form a fleet of two\r\ndivisions from the Channel squadrons and the cruiser fleet.\r\n\r\n“The first division will be formed of the following battleships:\r\nBulwark (Vice-Admiral Domvile’s flagship), Albemarle, Duncan, Montagu,\r\nFormidable, Renown, Irresistible, and Hannibal.\r\n\r\n“The cruisers Bacchante (Rear-Admiral Walker), Gladiator, Naiad,\r\nHermione, Minerva, Rainbow, Pegasus, Pandora, Abukir, Vindictive, and\r\nDiana.\r\n\r\n“The destroyers Dragon, Griffin, Panther, Locust, Boxer, Mallard,\r\nCoquette, Cygnet, and Zephyr.\r\n\r\n“Two torpedo flotillas.\r\n\r\n“Two ammunition ships, two colliers, and a hospital ship are to be\r\nallotted to the division.\r\n\r\n“The second division will be formed of the following battleships:\r\nMajestic (Vice-Admiral Lord Beresford), Magnificent (Rear-Admiral\r\nLambton), Cornwallis, Exmouth, Russell, Mars, Prince George, Victorious,\r\nand Caesar.\r\n\r\n“The cruisers St. George (Captain Winsloe), Sutlej, Niobe, Brilliant,\r\nDoris, Furious, Pactolus, Prometheus, Juno, Pyramus, and Pioneer.\r\n\r\n“The destroyers Myrmidon, Chamois, Flying Fish, Kangaroo, Desperate,\r\nFawn, Ardent, Ariel, and Albatross.\r\n\r\n“Two torpedo flotillas.\r\n\r\n“Two ammunition ships, two colliers, and a hospital ship are to be\r\nalloted to the division.\r\n\r\n“A squadron under Commodore Prince Louis of Battenberg (flagship,\r\nImplacable) will remain in reserve to watch for the possible approach of\r\na French fleet. In case one is seen, the first division is to unite with\r\nthis reserve squadron under the supreme command of Vice-Admiral Domvile,\r\nand to attack the French fleet vigorously, it being left to the second\r\ndivision to give battle to the German fleet. The general orders given\r\nto the fleet for the attack will then only apply to the second division.\r\nHis Majesty’s Government expects that the division will be able to\r\ndefeat the enemy, even without the help of the first division. As soon\r\nas the scouts of the second division have driven the German guardships\r\nfrom the mouth of the West Schelde, the left wing of the fighting ships\r\nwill open fire on Flushing, the right on the land fortifications of the\r\nsouth bank. The wings are not to stop, but to advance with the rest of\r\nthe fleet, and the entire division will press on to Antwerp or until\r\nit meets the German fighting fleet, which must be attacked with the\r\ngreatest vigour.\r\n\r\n“The precise details of the manner of attack are left to Vice-Admiral\r\nDomvile.\r\n\r\n“If, contrary to expectation, the German fleet, at the beginning of the\r\nattack in the mouth of the Schelde, should decide upon an advance,\r\nthe admiral commanding must act upon his own judgment, according to\r\ncircumstances; but, above all, it should be remembered that it is of\r\nmore importance to capture as many German ships as possible than to\r\ndestroy them, so that the captured ships may be used by us during the\r\nfurther course of the war.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince-Admiral had listened in silence while Heideck was reading.\r\nThe excitement which what he had heard had caused him was plainly\r\nreflected in his features.\r\n\r\n“There seems a strong internal probability that these orders are\r\ngenuine,” he said thoughtfully; “but I should like to have further\r\nand more positive proof of it; for it is quite possible that it is\r\nintentionally designed to mislead us. Where does this document come\r\nfrom, Herr major?”\r\n\r\n“I have already most humbly reported to your Royal Highness that I have\r\ninduced the skipper Brandelaar, whom I arrested as an English spy,\r\nto act for the future in our interest. Brandelaar’s boat brought this\r\norder.”\r\n\r\n“Where is this man?”\r\n\r\n“His boat lies in Flushing harbour.”\r\n\r\n“And how did Brandelaar get possession of it?”\r\n\r\n“I did not get it from Brandelaar himself, but from a lady, an\r\nEnglishwoman, who crossed with him from Dover. My honour imposes silence\r\nupon me. I must not mention this lady’s name, but I am firmly convinced\r\nand believe that I can guarantee that the document in Admiral Hollway’s\r\noffice has been copied word for word.”\r\n\r\n“We can soon find means of convincing ourselves whether the British\r\nfleet is preparing to carry out these orders. Then at last the time for\r\nenergetic action would have arrived. His Majesty has foreseen some such\r\nadvance on the part of the British fleet, and we have now to carry out\r\nthe plan of the supreme commander. I thank you, Herr major!”\r\n\r\nHeideck bowed and turned to go. He felt that he could endure it no\r\nlonger, and it was only with an effort that he maintained his erect,\r\nmilitary bearing.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the threshold, the Prince turned to him again, and said,\r\n“I think I shall be doing you an honour, Herr major, if I give you the\r\nopportunity of witnessing, by my side, the events of that great and\r\nglorious day in the life of our youthful fleet. Report yourself to me\r\non the morning of the 15th of July on board my flagship. I will see that\r\nyour present post is provided for.”\r\n\r\n“Your Royal Highness is very gracious.”\r\n\r\n“You have a claim on my thanks. Au revoir, then, Herr major.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince immediately summoned the adjutant on duty, and ordered him\r\nto have several copies of the English naval plan of attack prepared at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nOne of these was intended for the admiral in command of the French fleet\r\nat Cherbourg. The Prince gave the imperial messenger, who was to convey\r\nthe document to him, an autograph letter in which he urged upon the\r\nadmiral to do his utmost to reach Flushing on the morning of the 15th\r\nwith as strong a fighting fleet as possible, so as to assist the German\r\nfleet in its engagement with the numerically superior fleet of the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\nNEWS OF AN OLD FRIEND\r\n\r\n\r\n“Dear Friend and Comrade,--Although it is still painful for me to write,\r\nI cannot deny myself the pleasure of being the first to congratulate you\r\non receiving the Order of St. Vladimir. A friend in the War Office has\r\njust informed me that the announcement has appeared in the Gazette. I\r\nhope that this decoration, which you so fully earned by your services at\r\nthe occupation of Simla, will cause you some satisfaction. You are aware\r\nthat the Vladimir can only be bestowed on Russians or foreigners in the\r\nservice of Russia, and thus you will be one of the few German officers\r\nwhose breast is adorned with this mark of distinction so highly prized\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\n“You will be surprised that my congratulations are sent from St.\r\nPetersburg; no doubt you thought of me as still in sunny India, the\r\ntheatre of our mutual adventures in the war. I should certainly have\r\nremained there till the end of the campaign, had not an English bullet\r\ntemporarily put an end to my military activity--all too soon for my\r\nambition, as you can imagine. Uninjured in two great battles and\r\na number of trifling skirmishes, I was unhappily destined to be\r\nincapacitated in quite an unimportant and inglorious encounter. Had I\r\nnot been saved by an heroic woman, you would have heard no more of your\r\nold friend Tchajawadse, except that he was one of those who had remained\r\non the field of honour.\r\n\r\n“Can you guess the name of this woman, comrade? I do not think you can\r\nhave entirely forgotten my supposed page Georgi, and I am telling you\r\nnothing new to-day in lifting the veil of the secrecy, with which for\r\nobvious reasons I was obliged to shroud his relations to me in India.\r\nGeorgi was a girl, and for years she has been dearer to me than anyone\r\nelse. She was of humble birth, and possessed little of what we call\r\nculture. But, nevertheless, she was to me the dearest creature that\r\nI have ever met on my wanderings through two continents; a wonderful\r\ncompound of savagery and goodness of heart, of ungovernable pride and\r\nunselfish, devoted affection--a child and a heroine. She had given\r\nherself to me, and followed me on my journeys from pure inclination, not\r\nfor the sake of any advantage. It had been her own wish to play the part\r\nof a servant. I do not, however, mean to say that she never made use\r\nof the power she possessed over me, for she was proud, and knew how to\r\ngovern.\r\n\r\n“Once, at the beginning of our Indian journey, extremely irritated by\r\nher obstinate pride, I raised my hand against her. One look from her\r\nbrought me to my senses before the punishment followed. Afterwards, when\r\nmy blood had long cooled, she said to me, her eyes still blazing with\r\nanger, ‘If you had really struck me I should have left you at once, and\r\nno entreaties would ever have induced me to return to you.’ I laughed\r\nat her words, but from that time exercised more control over myself.\r\nWe lived in perfect harmony till the day when Georgi saved your life in\r\nLahore, my valued comrade. It was she who brought me the terrible news\r\nthat you were being led away to death. I had never seen the girl\r\nso fearfully excited before. Her eyes glistened and her whole frame\r\ntrembled. It seemed as if she would have driven me forward with the\r\nlash, that I might not be too late. I myself was too anxious to worry\r\nmy head much about the girl’s singular excitement. But after you were\r\nhappily saved, when you were concealed in my tent, and I looked for\r\nGeorgi to tell her of the result of my intervention, she fell into such\r\na paroxysm of joy that my jealous suspicions were aroused. Carried away\r\nby excitement I flung an insult at her, and then, when she answered me\r\ndefiantly--to her misfortune and mine I had my riding-whip in my hand--I\r\ncommitted a hateful act, which I would rather have recalled than any of\r\nmy other numerous follies. She received the blow in silence. The next\r\nmoment she had disappeared, and I waited in vain for her return. Till we\r\nleft Simla I had her searched for everywhere, but no trace of her\r\ncould be found. I myself then gave her up for lost. After our return\r\nto Lahore, when we were marching on to Delhi, I occasionally heard of a\r\ngirl wearing Indian dress who had appeared in the neighbourhood of our\r\ntroop and resembled my lost page Georgi. But as soon as I made inquiries\r\nafter this girl it seemed as if the earth had swallowed her up, and\r\nunder the rapidly changing impressions of the war her image gradually\r\nfaded from my mind.\r\n\r\n“During a reconnaissance near Lucknow, which I had undertaken with my\r\nregimental staff and a small escort, my own carelessness led us into\r\nan ambuscade set by the English, which cost most of my companions their\r\nlives. At the beginning of the encounter a shot in the back had unhorsed\r\nme. I was taken for dead, and those few of my companions who were able\r\nto save themselves by flight had no time to take the fallen with them.\r\nAfter lying for a long time unconscious, I saw, on awaking, a number of\r\narmed Indians plundering the dead and wounded. One of the brown devils\r\napproached me. When he saw me lifting myself up to grasp my revolver, he\r\nrushed upon me brandishing his sword. I parried the first thrust at my\r\nhead with my right arm. Defenceless as I was, I was already prepared for\r\nthe worst. But at the moment, when the rascal was lifting up his arm\r\nfor another thrust, he reeled backwards and collapsed without uttering a\r\nsound. It was Georgi, who had saved my life by a well-directed shot.\r\n\r\n“She had accompanied the dragoons sent from our camp to recover the dead\r\nand wounded, and had got considerably in advance of the horsemen. Hence\r\nit had been possible for her to save me.\r\n\r\n“I was too weak to ask her many questions, and my memory is a blank as\r\nto the few moments of this meeting.\r\n\r\n“For a week I lay between life and death. Then my iron constitution\r\ntriumphed. You can imagine, my dearest friend, how great my desire was\r\nto see Georgi again. But she was no longer in the camp, and no one could\r\ntell me where she was. She disappeared again as suddenly as she had\r\nappeared on that day. This time I must make up my mind to the conviction\r\nthat I have lost her for ever. While on my sick bed I received a command\r\nto repair to St. Petersburg. At the same time I was highly flattered to\r\nlearn that I had been promoted, and as soon as my condition permitted\r\nit, I started on my journey.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, dear friend, for lingering so long over a personal matter,\r\nwhich, after all, can have very little interest for you.\r\n\r\n“You are as well informed as myself of the manifold changes of this war,\r\nwhich has already destroyed the value of untold millions, and has cost\r\nhundreds of thousands of promising human lives. I could almost envy you\r\nfor being still spared to be an eyewitness of the great events, while I\r\nam condemned to the role of an inactive spectator. But I do not believe\r\nthe struggle will last much longer. The sacrifices which it imposes on\r\nthe people are too great to be endured many months longer. Everything is\r\npressing to a speedy and decisive result, and I have no doubt what that\r\nresult will be. For although the defeats and losses sustained by the\r\nEnglish are partly compensated by occasional successes, one great naval\r\nvictory of the allies would finally decide the issue against Great\r\nBritain. Hitherto, both sides have hesitated to bring about this\r\ndecisive result, but all here are convinced that the next few weeks will\r\nat last bring those great events on the water, so long and so eagerly\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n“To my surprise, I see that our treaty of peace with Japan is still the\r\nsubject of hostile criticism in the foreign Press. Certainly, in the\r\nsecond phase of the campaign, the fortune of war had turned in our\r\nfavour, but the struggle for India was so important for Russia that she\r\nwas unwilling to divide her forces any longer. Hence we were able to\r\nbuild a golden bridge for Japan, and hence the peace of Nagasaki. The\r\nGerman Imperial Chancellor is highly popular in Russia also, owing to\r\nthe part he took in the conclusion of the peace.\r\n\r\n“Have you had the opportunity of approaching the Imperial Chancellor?\r\nThis Baron Grubenhagen must be a man of strong personality.\r\n\r\n“I am sending this letter to you by way of Berlin, for I do not know\r\nwhere you are at this moment. I hope it will reach you, and that you\r\nwill occasionally find time to gladden your old friend Tchajawadse by\r\nletting him know that you are still alive.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHeideck had glanced rapidly through the Prince’s letter, written\r\nin French, which he had found waiting for him after his return from\r\nAntwerp. Not even the news of the honourable distinction conferred by\r\nthe bestowal of the Russian order had been able to evoke a sign of joy\r\non his grave countenance. The amiable Russian Prince and his beautiful\r\npage were to him like figures belonging to a remote past, that lay an\r\nendless distance behind him. The events of the last twenty-four hours\r\nhad shaken him so violently that what might perhaps a few days before\r\nhave aroused his keenest interest now seemed a matter of indifference\r\nand no concern of his.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the orderly announced a man in sailor’s dress, and\r\nHeideck knew that it could only be Brandelaar. The skipper had already\r\ngiven the information which he had brought from Dover to the officer on\r\nduty who had taken Heideck’s place. If they were not exactly military\r\nsecrets which by that means became known to the German military\r\nauthorities, some items of the various information might prove of\r\nimportance as affecting the Prince-Admiral’s arrangements.\r\n\r\nHeideck assumed that Brandelaar had now come for his promised reward.\r\nBut as the skipper, after receiving the money, kept turning his hat\r\nbetween his fingers, like a man who does not like to perform a painful\r\nerrand or make a disagreeable request, Heideck asked in astonishment:\r\n“Have you anything else to say to me, Brandelaar?”\r\n\r\nOnly after considerable hesitation he replied, “Yes, Herr major, I was\r\nto bring you a greeting--you will know who sent it.”\r\n\r\n“I think I can guess. You have seen the lady again since yesterday\r\nevening?”\r\n\r\n“The lady came to me last night at the inn and demanded to be taken back\r\nto Dover at once. But I thought you would not like it.”\r\n\r\n“So then you refused?”\r\n\r\nBrandelaar continued to stare in front of him at the floor.\r\n\r\n“The lady would go--in spite of the bad weather. And she would not be\r\nsatisfied till I had persuaded my friend Van dem Bosch to take her in\r\nhis cutter to Dover?”\r\n\r\n“This was last night?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--last night.”\r\n\r\n“And what more?” persisted Heideck.\r\n\r\n“He came back at noon to-day. They had a misfortune on the way.”\r\n\r\nHeideck’s frame shook convulsively. A fearful suspicion occurred to him.\r\nHe needed all his strength of will to control himself.\r\n\r\n“And the lady?”\r\n\r\n“Herr major, it was the lady who met with an accident. She fell\r\noverboard on the journey.”\r\n\r\nHeideck clasped the back of the chair before him with both hands. Every\r\ndrop of blood had left his face.\r\n\r\n“Fell--overboard? Good God, man--and she was not saved?”\r\n\r\nBrandelaar shook his hand.\r\n\r\n“No, Herr major! She would stay on deck in spite of the storm, though\r\nVan dem Bosch kept asking her to go below. When a violent squall broke\r\nthe halyard, she was knocked overboard by the gaff. As the sea was\r\nrunning high, there was no chance of saving her.”\r\n\r\nHeideck had covered his face with his hand. A dull groan burst from his\r\nviolently heaving breast and a voice within him exclaimed--\r\n\r\n“The guilt is yours. She sought death of her own accord, and it was you\r\nwho drove her to it!”\r\n\r\nHis voice sounded dry and harsh when he turned to the skipper and said--\r\n\r\n“I thank you for your information, Brandelaar. Now leave me alone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE LANDING IN SCOTLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ninth and tenth army corps had collected at the inlet of Kid\r\nharbour. The town of Kiel and its environs resounded with the clattering\r\nof arms, the stamping of horses and the joyful songs of the soldiers,\r\nwho, full of hope, were expecting great and decisive events. But no one\r\nknew anything for certain about the object of the impending expedition.\r\n\r\nFrom the early hours of the morning of the 13th of July an almost\r\nendless stream of men, horses, and guns poured over the landing-bridges,\r\nwhich connected the giant steamers of the shipping companies with the\r\nharbour quays. Other divisions of troops were taken on board in boats,\r\nand on the evening of the 14th the whole field army, consisting of\r\n60,000 men, was embarked.\r\n\r\nLast of all, the general commanding, accompanied by the Imperial\r\nChancellor, proceeded in a launch on board the large cruiser Konig\r\nWilhelm, which lay at anchor in the Bay of Holtenall. Immediately\r\nafterwards, three rockets, mounting brightly against the dark sky, went\r\nup from the flagship. At this signal, the whole squadron started slowly\r\nin the direction of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal.\r\n\r\nThe transport fleet consisted of about sixty large steamers, belonging\r\nto the North-German Lloyd, the Hamburg-America, and the Stettin\r\ncompanies. They were protected by the battleships Baden, Wurttemberg,\r\nBayern, and Sachsen, the large cruisers Kaiser and Deutschland, the\r\nsmall cruisers Gazelle, Prinzess Wilhelm, Irene, Komet, and Meteor, and\r\nthe torpedo divisions D 5 and D 6, accompanied by their torpedo-boat\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nThe last torpedo-boat had long left the harbour, when, about eleven\r\no’clock in the forenoon of the 15th of July, the dull thunder of the\r\nEnglish ironclads resounded before the fortifications of the inlet of\r\nKiel, answered by the guns of the German fortress.\r\n\r\nBright sunshine was breaking through the light clouds when the Konig\r\nWilhelm entered the Elbe at Brunsbuttel. The boats of the torpedo\r\ndivision, hastening forward, reported the mouth of the river free from\r\nEnglish warships, and a wireless message was received from Heligoland in\r\nconfirmation of this.\r\n\r\nThe squadron proceeded at full speed to the north-west. The torpedo\r\ndivision D 5 reconnoitred in advance, the small, swift boats being\r\nfollowed by the cruisers Prinzess Wilhelm and Irene, which from their\r\nhigh rigging were especially adapted for scouting operations and carried\r\nthe necessary apparatus for wireless telegraphy. The rest of the fleet,\r\nwhose speed had to be regulated by that of the Konig Wilhelm, followed\r\nat the prescribed intervals.\r\n\r\nWhen the sharp outlines of the red cliffs of Heligoland appeared, the\r\nGerman cruiser Seeadler came from the island to meet the squadron and\r\nreported that the coast ironclads Aegir and Odin, the cruisers Hansa,\r\nVineta, Freya, and Hertha, together with the torpedo-boats, had set out\r\nfrom Wilhelmshaven during the night and had seen nothing of the enemy.\r\nThe sea appeared free. All the available English warships of the North\r\nSea squadron had advanced to attack Antwerp.\r\n\r\nSince the transport fleet did not appear to need reinforcements, it\r\nproceeded on its way west-north-west with its attendant warships, the\r\nWilhelmshaven fleet remaining at Heligoland.\r\n\r\nWhat was its destination?\r\n\r\nOnly a few among the many thousands could have given an answer, and they\r\nremained silent. The red cliffs of Heligoland had long since disappeared\r\nin the distance. Hours passed, but nothing met the eyes of the eagerly\r\ngazing warriors, save the boundless, gently rippling sea and the\r\ncrystal-clear blue vault of heaven, stretched above it like a huge bell.\r\n\r\n“What is our destination?”\r\n\r\nIt could not be the coast of England, which would have been reached\r\nlong ago. But where was the landing to take place, if not there? To\r\nwhat distant shore was the German army being taken, the largest whose\r\ndestinies had ever been entrusted to the treacherous waves of the sea?\r\n\r\nWhen daylight again brought a report from the scouts that the enemy’s\r\nships were nowhere to be seen, the Commander-in-Chief of the army could\r\nnot help expressing his surprise to the Admiral that the English had\r\napparently entirely neglected scouting in the North Sea, and further,\r\nthat they did not even see any merchant vessels.\r\n\r\n“The explanation of this apparently surprising fact is not very remote,\r\nYour Excellency,” replied the Admiral. “We should hardly sight\r\nany merchantmen, since maritime trade is now almost entirely at a\r\nstandstill, owing to the insecurity of the seas. We have not met a\r\nflotilla of fishing-boats, since in this part of the North Sea there are\r\nno fishing-grounds. We see none of the enemy’s ships, since the\r\nEnglish have most likely calculated every other possibility except our\r\nattempting to land in Scotland.”\r\n\r\n“Your explanation is obvious, Herr Admiral; nevertheless, it seems to me\r\nthat our enemy must have neglected to take the necessary precautions in\r\nkeeping a look-out.”\r\n\r\n“Your Excellency must not draw an offhand comparison between operations\r\non land and on sea. The conditions in the latter are essentially\r\ndifferent. I do not doubt for a moment that there is a sufficient number\r\nof English scouts in the North Sea; if we have really escaped their\r\nnotice, the fortune of war has been favourable to us. I may tell Your\r\nExcellency that, even during our manoeuvres in the Baltic, where we know\r\nthe course as well as the speed and strength of the marked enemy, he\r\nhas sometimes succeeded in making his way through, unseen by our scouts.\r\nPerhaps this will mitigate your judgment of this apparent want of\r\nforesight on the part of the English.”\r\n\r\nAt last, on the evening of the 16th of July, land was reported by the\r\nKonig Wilhelm. The end of the journey was in sight, and the news spread\r\nrapidly that it was the coast of Scotland rising from the waves.\r\n\r\n“We are going to enter the Firth of Forth,” was the general opinion.\r\nEven the brave soldiers, who perhaps heard the name for the first time\r\nin their lives, repeated the word with as important an air as if all the\r\nsecrets of the military staff had been all at once revealed to them.\r\n\r\nIn the red light of the setting sun both shores appeared tinged with\r\nviolet from the deep-blue sky and the grey-blue sea, the north shore\r\nbeing further off than the south. Favoured by a calm sea, the squadron,\r\nextended in close order to a distance of about five knots, made for the\r\nentrance of the Firth of Forth.\r\n\r\nFull of expectation, the expeditionary army saw the vast, bold\r\nundertaking develop before its eyes. For nine hundred years no hostile\r\narmy had landed on the coast of England. Certainly, in ancient times\r\nBritain had had to fight against invading enemies: Julius Caesar had\r\nentered as a conqueror, Canute the Great, King of Denmark, had subdued\r\nthe country. The Angles and Saxons had come over from Germany, to make\r\nthemselves masters of the land. Harold the Fairhaired, King of Norway,\r\nhad landed in England. But since the time of William of Normandy, who\r\ndefeated the Saxons at Hastings and set up the rule of the Normans in\r\nEngland, not even her most powerful enemies, neither Philip of Spain\r\nnor the great Napoleon, had succeeded in landing their troops on the\r\nsea-girt soil of England.\r\n\r\nWould a German army now succeed?\r\n\r\nThe outlines of the country became clearer and clearer; some even\r\nbelieved they could see the lofty height of Edinburgh Castle on the\r\nhorizon. But soon the distant view was obscured and darkness slowly came\r\non.\r\n\r\nHitherto not a single hostile ship had been seen. But now, when\r\nthe greater part of the squadron had already entered the bay, the\r\nsearchlights discovered two English cruisers whose presence had already\r\nbeen reported by the advance boats of the torpedo division.\r\n\r\nIn view of our great superiority, these cruisers declined battle, and\r\nby hauling down their flag, signified their readiness to surrender.\r\nFrom the sea, nothing remained to hinder the landing of the troops. The\r\ntransports approached the south shore of the bay, on which Edinburgh\r\nand the harbour town of Leith are situated; and, after casting\r\nanchor, landed the troops in boats by the electric light. The infantry\r\nimmediately occupied the positions favourable to meet any attack that\r\nmight be made. But nothing happened to prevent the landing. The Scottish\r\npopulation remained perfectly calm, so that the disembarkation was\r\ncompleted without disturbance.\r\n\r\nThe population of Leith and the inhabitants of Edinburgh, who had\r\nhurried up full of curiosity, beheld, to their boundless astonishment,\r\na spectacle almost incomprehensible to them, carried out with admirable\r\nprecision under the bright electric light from the German ships.\r\n\r\nThe people had taken the keenest interest in the great war of England\r\nagainst the allied Powers--Germany, France, and Russia--but with a\r\nfeeling that it was a matter which chiefly concerned the Government,\r\nthe Army, and the Navy. They were painfully aware that things were going\r\nworse and worse for them, but were convinced that the Government would\r\nsoon overthrow the enemy. Everyone knew that the Russians had penetrated\r\ninto India, but the great mass of the people did not trouble about that.\r\nIt could only be a passing misfortune, and trade, which was at present\r\nruined, would soon revive and be all the more flourishing. But the idea\r\nthat an enemy, a continental army, could land on the coast of Great\r\nBritain, that German or French soldiers could ever set foot on British\r\nsoil, had seemed to Scotsmen so remote a contingency that they now\r\nappeared completely overcome by the logic of accomplished facts.\r\n\r\nAbout noon on the following day the two army corps were already south of\r\nLeith. A brigade had been pushed forward towards the south; the rest of\r\nthe troops had bivouacked, that the men might recuperate after their two\r\ndays’ sea journey.\r\n\r\nThe quartermasters had purchased provisions for ready money in the town,\r\nthe villages, and the scattered farmhouses. The warships filled their\r\nbunkers from the abundant stock of English coal, guardships being\r\ndetached to ensure the safety of the squadron. The Admiral had ordered\r\nthat, after coaling, the warships should take up a position at the\r\nentrance to the bay, the transports remaining in the harbour. In the\r\npossible event of the appearance of a superior English squadron the\r\nwhole fleet was to leave the Firth of Forth as rapidly as possible and\r\ndisperse in all directions. Certainly in that case the army would be\r\ndeprived of the means of returning, but the military authorities were\r\nconvinced that the appearance of an army of 60,000 German troops on\r\nBritish soil would practically mean the end of the war, especially as\r\nan equally strong French corps was to land in the south. The military\r\nauthorities consequently thought they need not trouble themselves\r\nfurther about the possibility of the troops having to return.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of Edinburgh had surrendered without resistance, since it\r\nwould have been far too weak to offer any opposition to the invading\r\narmy. Accordingly the German officers and soldiers could move about\r\nin the town without hindrance. A number of despatches and fresh war\r\nbulletins were found which threw some light upon the strategic position,\r\nalthough they were partly obscure, and partly contained obvious\r\nfalsehoods.\r\n\r\nA great naval battle was said to have taken place off Flushing on the\r\n15th of July, ending in the retreat of the German and French fleets\r\nwith heavy losses. It was further reported that the British fleet had\r\ndestroyed Flushing and bombarded several of the Antwerp forts. Lastly,\r\naccording to the newspapers, the English fleet which had been stationed\r\nbefore Copenhagen had entered Kid harbour and captured all the German\r\nships inside, the loss of the English battleships at the Kieler Fohrde\r\nbeing admitted. The German officers were convinced that only the report\r\nof the loss of the two battleships deserved credit, since the English\r\nwould hardly have invented such bad news. Everything else, from the\r\nposition of things, bore the stamp of improbability on the face of it.\r\n\r\nThe trumpets blew, the soldiers grasped their arms, the battalions began\r\ntheir march. The batteries clattered along with a dull rumble. In four\r\ncolumns, by four routes, side by side the four divisions started for the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF FLUSHING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strategy of red tape, by which the Commander-in-Chief’s hands were\r\ntied, was destined, as in so many previous campaigns, to prove on this\r\noccasion also a fatal error to the English.\r\n\r\nSir Percy Domvile, the British admiral, had received with silent rage\r\nthe order of battle communicated to him from London--the same order that\r\nhad fallen into the hands of the Germans. More than once already he had\r\nattempted to show the Lords of the Admiralty what injury might be caused\r\nby being tied to strict written orders in situations that could not\r\nbe foreseen. He now held in his own hands the proof how little the\r\nofficials, pervaded by the consciousness of their own importance and\r\nsuperior wisdom, were disposed to allow themselves to be taught. But\r\nhe was too much of a service-man not to acquiesce in the orders of the\r\nsupreme court with unquestioning obedience. Certainly, if he had been\r\nable to gauge in advance the far-reaching consequences of the mistake\r\nalready committed, he would probably, as a patriot, rather have\r\nsacrificed himself than become the instrument for carrying out the\r\nfundamentally erroneous tactics of the plan of battle communicated to\r\nhim. For more was now at stake than the proud British nation had ever\r\nrisked before in a naval engagement. It was a question of England’s\r\nprestige as the greatest naval power in the world, perhaps of the final\r\nissue of this campaign which had been so disastrous for Great Britain.\r\nAll-powerful Albion, the dreaded mistress of the seas, was now fighting\r\nfor honour and existence. A great battle lost might easily mean a blow\r\nfrom which the British lion, wounded to death, would never be able to\r\nrecover.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nAt the time when the Konig Wilhelm entered the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal\r\nat the head of the German transport fleet, the Prince-Admiral, who had\r\nhoisted his flag on the Wittelsbach, led the fighting fleet from the\r\nharbour of Antwerp into the Zuid Bevelanden Canal, which connects the\r\nEast and West Schelde, and separates the island of Walcheren from Zuid\r\nBevelanden. Anchor was then cast.\r\n\r\nHis squadron consisted of the battleships of the Wittelsbach\r\nclass--Mecklenburg, Schwaben, Zahringen, Wettin, and Wittelsbach (the\r\nflagship of the Prince-Admiral), and the battleships of the Kaiser\r\nclass--Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, Barbarossa, Karl der Grosse, Wilhelm\r\nII., and Friedrich III.\r\n\r\nThese ironclads were accompanied by the large cruisers Friedrich Karl,\r\nPrinz Adalbert, Prinz Heinrich, Furst Bismarck, Viktoria Luise, Kaiserin\r\nAugusta, and the small cruisers Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, Undine, Arcona,\r\nFrauenlob, and Medusa.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo flotilla at the Prince’s disposal consisted of the\r\ntorpedo-boats S 102 to 107, G 108 to 113, S 114 to 125, with the\r\ndivision boats D 10, D 9, D 7, and D 8, built on the scale of\r\ndestroyers.\r\n\r\nThe three fast cruisers Friedrich Karl, Prinz Adalbert and Kaiserin\r\nAugusta, with the torpedo-boats S 114 to 120, had been sent on as\r\nscouts, to announce the approach of the enemy in good time. The cruisers\r\nhad been ordered to post themselves thirty knots west-north-west of\r\nFlushing at intervals of five knots, while the torpedo-boats patrolled\r\non all sides to keep a look-out. After having reported the approach\r\nof the English fleet to the main squadron by wireless telegraphy,\r\nthe scouts were to retire before the enemy out of range into the West\r\nSchelde, and at the same time to keep up such a fire in their boilers\r\nthat the clouds of thick smoke might deceive the enemy as to the size\r\nand number of the retiring ships. When out of sight of the English,\r\nthey were to wheel round and show themselves, and, if circumstances\r\npermitted, take up the positions previously assigned them; otherwise\r\nthey were to act according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe object of this manoeuvre, calculated to mislead the enemy, was\r\ncompletely attained.\r\n\r\nA signal informed the Prince-Admiral that the English were in sight, and\r\na torpedo-boat detached from the scouting squadron brought more\r\nexact information as to the number and formation of the enemy’s\r\nships--information which exactly corresponded with the instructions\r\ngiven in the order of battle, and was a fresh proof that it was intended\r\nto adhere to them.\r\n\r\nThis provided a sure foundation for the tactical operations of the\r\nGerman fleet. No alteration was necessary in the course of action\r\ndecided upon at the council of war on the previous day, and no fresh\r\ninstructions had to be issued to individual commanders.\r\n\r\nThe order of battle settled at this council of war ran, in the main, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n“The squadron will lie at anchor off Zuid-Beveland, fires banked, so\r\nthat they can get up steam in a quarter of an hour. The battleships will\r\nanchor in double line, according to their tactical numbers. The cruisers\r\nbetween Nord-Beveland and Zuid-Beveland. The torpedo-boats with their\r\ndivision boats behind.\r\n\r\n“At the signal ‘weigh anchor’ the ships carry out the order according to\r\ntheir tactical number; the battleships through the Roompot; the cruisers\r\nwill re-enter the West Schelde through the canal and lie off Flushing\r\nathwart.\r\n\r\n“The two other torpedo-boat divisions will accompany the squadron.”\r\n\r\nThe course of events developed exactly in accordance with these\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\nWhen the approach of the enemy’s ships was announced, the\r\nPrince-Admiral’s flaghip signalled: “Weigh anchor! hoist top pennants!\r\nclear for action! follow in the Admiral’s wake! cruiser division and\r\ntorpedo-boats execute orders!”\r\n\r\nKeeping close under the coast of Walcheren, the German squadron, full\r\nsteam up, advanced to meet the enemy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the approaching English, having left their hospital and\r\nmunition ships and colliers in the open under the protection of the\r\ncruisers and taken up their appointed positions, opened fire at a\r\ndistance of about 6,000 yards on Flushing and Fort Frederik Hendrik.\r\n\r\nThe English Admiral adhered so strictly to his instructions that,\r\nwith an incomprehensible carelessness, he neglected to search the East\r\nSchelde with his second squadron, or even with his scouts. The entry of\r\nthe German ships which had been sent back from the open into the\r\nWest Schelde, evidently appeared to Sir Percy Domvile a sufficient\r\nconfirmation of the assumption that the whole German fleet was in this\r\narm of the river’s mouth, for the clouds of smoke which they emitted\r\nrendered an accurate computation of their strength impossible.\r\n\r\nThus, the Prince-Admiral’s squadron was enabled to approach the enemy\r\nso far unobserved that it would be able to take the British fleet in the\r\nflank, when it had reached the west point of Walcheren.\r\n\r\nAt the signal: “Full steam ahead!” the German ships in the formation\r\nagreed steamed against the surprised English, and opened fire from\r\ntheir bow-guns. Naturally, the English Admiral at once ordered the first\r\nsquadron to take up its position behind the second, turned left with\r\nboth, and went to meet the enemy in double line.\r\n\r\nThis was the opportune moment, foreseen in the Prince’s plan of battle,\r\nfor the advance of the cruisers lying in the West Schelde. In order\r\nto deceive the enemy as to their number, they rapidly approached,\r\naccompanied by the torpedo-boats which again sent up their clouds of\r\nsmoke. The English Admiral, completely surprised by the double attack,\r\nwas obliged to divide his attention.\r\n\r\nCertainly this torpedo attack was still a hazardous undertaking, under\r\nexisting conditions. The English shot well, and two German boats were\r\nsunk by the enemy’s shells. Three others, however, hit their mark,\r\ndamaging three of the English ships so severely that they were incapable\r\nof manoeuvring.\r\n\r\nIt was especially disadvantageous to the English that their\r\ntorpedo-boats, owing to the unforeseen change in the formation of the\r\nbattleships, were deprived of the necessary protection. The German\r\ndestroyers were not slow to make full use of this favourable situation,\r\nand began to chase them. In this engagement, which the speed of the\r\nlittle vessels rendered especially exciting for those who took part\r\nin it, the pursuers succeeded in destroying four English torpedo-boats\r\nwithout themselves suffering any damage worth mentioning. The others\r\nescaped, and, for the time, might be regarded as out of action.\r\n\r\nThe enemy having altered his front, the Prince-Admiral had turned right\r\nabout, so that he might enter into action with all the guns of one side.\r\nThe English Admiral also doubled, but the manoeuvre proved the cause of\r\na fatal misfortune. Whether the disturbance of the tactical unity by the\r\nloss of the three torpedoed vessels was the cause of it, or whether the\r\nfirst and second divisions were unaccustomed to manoeuvre together, the\r\nFormidable carried out orders so clumsily, that she was rammed amidships\r\nby her neighbour the Renown, and immediately heeled over and sunk in a\r\nfew minutes, carrying hundreds of brave English sailors with her into\r\nthe deep.\r\n\r\nThe Renown herself, whose ram had caused the fearful disaster, had not\r\nescaped without severe injury in the collision, which had shattered\r\nthe mighty floating fortress in all its joints. The two first fore\r\ncompartments, as the bulkheads did not hold together, had filled with\r\nwater. This caused the vessel to heel over; her value as a fighting\r\ninstrument was thereby sensibly diminished.\r\n\r\nThus the first great catastrophe in the battle was caused, not by the\r\npower of the enemy, but by the clumsy manoeuvring of a friendly ship.\r\nThis naturally caused many of the spectators, deeply affected by\r\nthe sinking of the magnificent vessel and her gallant crew, to ask\r\nthemselves whether the great perfection attained in the construction\r\nof modern ships of war was not to a great extent counterbalanced by\r\nthe defects that were combined with the increasing size and fighting\r\nstrength of these gigantic ironclads. No ship of the line, no frigate,\r\nnot even the little gunboat of earlier times could have disappeared from\r\nthe line of battle so speedily and without leaving a trace behind as\r\nthe Formidable, built of mighty dimensions and equipped with all the\r\nappliances of naval technique. No doubt her armour-plate and steel\r\nturrets would have been able successfully to resist a hail of the\r\nheaviest projectiles, but a misunderstood steering order had been\r\nsufficient to send her to the bottom. Neither the double bottoms nor the\r\ndivision of the bulkheads, which should have prevented the inrush of\r\nan excessive amount of water, had been able to avert the fate which\r\nthreatens every modern ironclad when severely damaged below the\r\nwater-line. The wooden ship of former times might have been riddled like\r\na sieve without sinking. But the stability of a modern ironclad could\r\nbe endangered by a single leak, whether caused by a torpedo or a ram, to\r\nsuch an extent that the gigantic mass of iron would be drawn down into\r\nthe depths by its own weight in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nA running fire now went on at a distance of about 2,000 yards, in which\r\nthe superiority of the Krupp guns was as clearly manifested as the\r\nadmirable training of the German artillerists, in which the English\r\nwere far inferior. Certainly, the German ships also suffered various\r\ninjuries, but no serious damage had as yet occurred.\r\n\r\nThe three torpedoed and helpless English warships offered especially\r\nfavourable targets to the German cruisers. The latter, taking up\r\npositions at a suitable distance, kept up such a heavy fire upon the\r\nvessels, which could scarcely move, that their surrender was inevitable.\r\nBut before deciding on this, the English offered an heroic resistance,\r\nand many of their shots took effect. The conning tower of the Friedrich\r\nKarl was pierced by a shell, and the brave commander with those around\r\nhim found a glorious soldier’s death. Other more or less serious\r\ninjuries were sustained, and it was almost a miracle that no vital\r\ndamage was done to any part of the ships’ hulls.\r\n\r\nAfter the three English ships had been put out of action, it was\r\nunnecessary for the cruiser division to remain any longer in this\r\nquarter of the scene of action. They accordingly proceeded with the\r\nutmost despatch to where the Prince-Admiral was engaged in the main\r\nfight with the battleships. Here, indeed, assistance was needed. For,\r\nalthough four of the enemy’s ships were lost, the superiority in numbers\r\nstill remained with the English, especially as the Mecklenburg had been\r\nobliged to sheer off, her steering gear having been shot to pieces.\r\n\r\nWhen the English Admiral saw the cruisers approaching, so that they\r\ncould bring all their bow-guns to bear at once, he recognised that the\r\ndecisive moment was at hand.\r\n\r\nThe cruisers’ guns inflicted severe damage on the English, for the crews\r\nhad practised shooting rapidly at a gradually diminishing distance. The\r\nhigh deck structures of the battleships offered an admirable target,\r\nso that in the extended English line of battle nearly every shot took\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nFor Sir Percy Domvile rapid and energetic action now became a necessary\r\ncondition of self-preservation. In the circumstances, the capture of\r\nthe German fleet, which according to the order of battle was to be the\r\nobject aimed at, was no longer to be thought of; the only thing left to\r\nthe Admiral was to endeavour to destroy as many of the enemy’s ships\r\nas possible. The British flagship signalled “Right about,” and the\r\ncommandants knew that this was as good as an order to ram the German\r\nironclads.\r\n\r\nBut this manoeuvre, by which alone Sir Percy Domvile could meet the\r\ndanger that threatened him in consequence of the attack from two sides,\r\nhad been provided for by the Prince-Admiral. It had been taken into\r\nconsideration at the council of war held on the previous evening, and\r\neach commander had received instructions as to the tactics to be pursued\r\nin such an event. A special signal had been agreed upon, and as soon as\r\nthe English ironclads were observed wheeling round, it was hoisted on\r\nthe Admiral’s ship. Each of the German battleships immediately took up\r\nthe position prescribed by the plan of battle. The squadron separated\r\ninto two halves; the first division, wheeling into line behind the\r\nflagship, made “left about” with it, while the second division, also\r\nmaking “left about,” took up its position between the left wing ship.\r\n\r\nThese tactics, quite unknown to him, were completely unexpected by the\r\nEnglish Admiral. His purpose was entirely frustrated by the speedy and\r\nclever manoeuvre of the German ships, the plan of destruction failed,\r\nand his own ironclads, while proceeding athwart, had to stand a terrible\r\nfire right and left, which was especially disastrous to the two ships on\r\nthe wings. Overwhelmed by a hail of light and heavy projectiles, and in\r\naddition hit by torpedoes, they were in a few minutes put out of action;\r\none of them, the Victorious, sharing the fate of the unlucky Formidable,\r\nsank with its crew of more than 700 men beneath the waves.\r\n\r\nBut the youthful German fleet had also received its baptism of fire in\r\nthis decisive battle.\r\n\r\nAll the means of destruction with which the modern art of war is\r\nacquainted were employed by each of the two opponents to snatch victory\r\nfrom his adversary. The shells of the heavy guns were combined with the\r\nprojectiles of the lighter armament and the machine-guns posted in the\r\nfighting-tops, so that in the real sense of the word it was a “hail of\r\nprojectiles,” which came down in passing on the ships wrapped in smoke\r\nand steam.\r\n\r\nHermann Heideck had become so thoroughly familiar in India with the\r\nhorrors of war on land in their various forms, that he believed his\r\nnerves were completely proof against the horrible sight of death and\r\ndevastation. But the scenes which were being enacted around him in\r\nthe comparatively narrow space of the magnificent flagship during this\r\nengagement, far surpassed in their awfulness everything that he had\r\nhitherto seen. Heideck was full of admiration for the heroic courage,\r\ncontempt of death, and discipline of officers and men, not one of whom\r\nstirred a foot from the post assigned him.\r\n\r\nAs he only played the part of an inactive spectator in the drama that\r\nhad now reached its climax, he was able to move freely over the ship.\r\nWherever he went, the same spectacle of horrible destruction and heroic\r\ndevotion to duty everywhere met his eye.\r\n\r\nThe men serving the guns in the turrets and casemates were enduring the\r\npains of hell. In the low, ironclad chambers a fiery heat prevailed,\r\nwhich rendered even breathing difficult. The terrific noise and the\r\nsuperhuman excitement of the nerves seemed to have so dulled the men’s\r\nsenses, that they no longer had any clear idea of what was going on\r\naround them. Their faces did not wear that expression of rage and\r\nexasperation, which Heideck had seen in so many soldiers in the land\r\nbattle at Lahore; rather, he observed a certain dull indifference, which\r\ncould no longer be shaken by the horror of the situation.\r\n\r\nA shell struck a battery before Heideck’s eyes, exploded, and with its\r\nflying splinters struck down nearly all the men serving the guns.\r\nHappy were those who found death at once; for the injuries of those who\r\nwrithed wounded on the ground were of a frightful nature. The red-hot\r\npieces of iron, which tore the unhappy men’s flesh and shattered their\r\nbones, at the same time inflicted fearful burns upon them. Indeed,\r\nHeideck would have regarded it as an act of humanity to have been\r\nallowed with a shot from a well-aimed revolver, to put an end to the\r\nsufferings of this or that unfortunate, whose skin and flesh hung in\r\nshreds from his body, or whose limbs were transformed into shapeless,\r\nbloody masses.\r\n\r\nBut those who had escaped injury, after a few moments’ stupefaction,\r\nresumed their duty with the same mechanical precision as before. Amidst\r\ntheir dead and dying comrades, about whom nobody could trouble himself\r\nfor the moment, they stood in the pools of warm, human blood, which\r\nmade the deck slippery, and quietly served the gun which had not been\r\nseriously damaged.\r\n\r\nA very young naval cadet, who had been sent down to the engine-room from\r\nthe Prince-Admiral’s conning-tower with an order, met Heideck on the\r\nnarrow, suffocatingly hot passage. He was a slender, handsome youth\r\nwith a delicate, boyish face. The blood was streaming over his eyes and\r\ncheeks from a wound in the forehead. He was obliged to lean with both\r\nhands against the wall for support, while, with a superhuman effort of\r\nwill, he compelled his tottering knees to carry him forward, his sole\r\nthought being that he must keep upright until he had fulfilled his\r\nerrand. When Heideck inquired sympathetically after the nature of his\r\nwound, he even attempted to wreathe his pale lips, quivering with pain,\r\ninto a smile, for in spite of his seventeen years he felt himself at\r\nthis moment quite a man and a soldier, to whom it was an honour and a\r\ndelight to die for his country. But his heroic will was stronger than\r\nhis body, wounded to death. In the attempt to assume an erect military\r\nbearing before the Major, he suddenly collapsed. He had just strength\r\nenough to give Heideck the Admiral’s order and ask him to carry it out.\r\nThen his senses left him.\r\n\r\nIn another battery the store of ammunition had been exploded by a\r\nshell. Not a man had escaped alive. Heideck himself, although since the\r\nbeginning of the engagement he had recklessly exposed himself to danger,\r\nhad hitherto, by a miracle, escaped death that threatened him in a\r\nhundred different forms. He had been permitted, by express command of\r\nthe Prince, to stay a considerable time in the upper conning-tower,\r\nfrom which the Imperial Admiral directed the battle, and the deliberate\r\ncalmness of the supreme commander, steadily pursuing his object, had\r\nfilled him with unshaken confidence in a victory for the German fleet,\r\nin spite of the numerical superiority of the English.\r\n\r\nEver since Heideck had heard the news of Edith Irwin’s death from\r\nBrandelaar, all purely human feelings and sensations that connected\r\nhim with life had died in his heart. He was no longer anything but the\r\nsoldier, whose thoughts and efforts were filled exclusively with anxiety\r\nfor the victory of his country’s arms. All personal experiences were\r\ncompletely forgotten as if they had taken place ten years ago. At this\r\nmoment, when the existence or extinction of nations was at stake,\r\nhis own life was of so little importance to him that he was not even\r\nconscious of the foolhardy intrepidity with which he risked it at every\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nMajestic and powerful, sending forth death-dealing flashes from her\r\nturrets and portholes, the Wittelsbach had hitherto proceeded on her\r\nway, not heeding the wounds which the enemy’s shot had inflicted in her\r\nhull. An almost thankful feeling for the glorious ship which carried him\r\narose in Heideck’s breast.\r\n\r\n“You do honour to the great name you bear,” he thought. Through\r\nsmoke and steam he looked up at the conning-tower, where he knew the\r\nPrince-Admiral was. Then he saw it no more, for suddenly a thick, black\r\ncloud overspread his eyes. He had only felt a slight blow in his breast,\r\nbut no pain. He tried to lift his hand to the place where he had been\r\nhit, but it sank powerlessly. It seemed as if he were being turned round\r\nin a circle by an invisible hand. Thousands of fiery sparks shot\r\nup suddenly from the dark cloud--the night closed completely round\r\nhim--deep, impenetrable night, and still, solemn silence.\r\n\r\nMajor Hermann Heideck had found a hero’s death.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nA torpedo-boat that had been summoned by signal hurried up at full\r\nspeed to the Admiral’s flagship which was lying on her side. A broadside\r\ntorpedo had struck the Wittelsbach; and although there was no fear of\r\nher sinking, it was impossible for operations to be directed from her\r\nany longer.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the danger it involved, the Prince-Admiral had himself and\r\nhis staff transferred by the torpedo-boat to the Zahringen, on which his\r\nflag was at once hoisted.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe progress of the engagement had hitherto been favourable to the\r\nGerman fleet to a surprising extent. Its losses were considerably less\r\nthan those of its numerically far superior enemy, and its ships, with\r\nfew exceptions, were still able to fight and manoeuvre. But as yet,\r\nconsidering the strength of the ships still at the enemy’s disposal,\r\nit was too early to speak of a decision in favour of the German fleet.\r\nAlthough the clever manoeuvre of the German squadron had frustrated the\r\nintended attack of the English, and inflicted very considerable losses\r\nupon them, it might still be possible for Sir Percy Domvile to atone for\r\nhis mistake and to bind the capricious fortune of war to his flag.\r\n\r\nThe same frightful scenes which Major Heideck had witnessed on board\r\nthe Wittelsbach had also taken place on the other German battleships\r\nand cruisers. Blood flowed in rivers, and, if the murderous engagement\r\ncontinued much longer, the moment could not be far off when it would no\r\nlonger be possible to fill the gaps caused by death in the ranks of the\r\nbrave crews. A few luckily-aimed English torpedoes, and no genius in the\r\nsupreme command, no heroism on the part of the captains, officers, and\r\ncrew would have been able to avert disaster from the German arms.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly a fresh, apparently very powerful squadron, was sighted\r\nfrom the south-west, which, if it had proved to be a British reserve\r\nfleet, must have decided the victory at once in favour of the English.\r\n\r\nThe moments that passed until the question was definitely settled were\r\nmoments of the keenest suspense and excitement for those on board the\r\nGerman vessels. The relief was so much the greater when it was seen to\r\nbe no fresh hostile force, but Admiral Courtille’s squadron, advancing\r\nat full speed, just at the right moment to decide the issue.\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs was now changed at one stroke so completely to\r\nthe disadvantage of the English, that a British victory had become an\r\nimpossibility. The intervention of the French squadron, still perfectly\r\nintact, consisting of ten battleships, ten large and ten small cruisers,\r\nwas bound to bring about the annihilation of the English fleet. The\r\nEnglish Admiral was quickwitted enough to gauge the situation correctly,\r\nas soon as he had recognised the approaching ships as the French fleet\r\nand assured himself of the enemy’s strength. The orders given to form\r\nagain for an attack were succeeded by fresh signals from the English\r\nflagship, ordering a rapid retreat. The English Admiral, regarding the\r\nbattle as definitely lost, considered it his duty to save what could\r\nstill be saved of the fleet under his charge. Before the French could\r\nactively intervene the English fleet steamed away at full speed to the\r\nnorth-west.\r\n\r\nThundering hurrahs on all the German ships acclaimed the victory\r\nannounced by this retreat. The boats of the torpedo division and some\r\nswift cruisers were ordered to keep in touch with the fleeing enemy.\r\n\r\nThe French Admiral in command had gone on board the flagship\r\nZahringen to place himself and his squadron under the command of the\r\nPrince-Admiral and to come to an arrangement as to the further joint\r\noperations of the combined fleets. For there was no doubt that the\r\nvictory ought to be utilised at once to the fullest extent, if it were\r\nreally to be decisive.\r\n\r\nDeeply moved, the Prince embraced Admiral Courtille, and thanked him for\r\nappearing at the critical moment. The French Admiral, however, excused\r\nhimself for intervening so late. “I was obliged,” said he, “to wait till\r\nit was night and steer far out to the south-west before I could turn\r\nnorth; I had to do this, so as to be able to break through Prince Louis\r\nof Battenberg’s blockading squadron without being seen, under cover of\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the scouts sent after the enemy had returned with the\r\ninformation that the English fleet had altered its course and appeared\r\nmaking for the Thames. Further pursuit was impossible, as the English\r\nAdmiral had detached some ships, for which the German cruisers were not\r\na match.\r\n\r\nPrevious arrangements had been made for transferring the dead and\r\nwounded to the ships signalled to for the purpose, and were carried out\r\nwithout great difficulty, the sea being now calmer. Now that the fearful\r\nbattle had ceased, for the first time the crews became fully conscious\r\nof the horrors they had passed through. The rescue of the wounded showed\r\nwhat cruel sacrifices the battle had demanded. It was a difficult and\r\nmelancholy task, which made many a sailor’s heart beat with sorrow and\r\ncompassion. The dead were for the most part horribly mangled by the\r\nsplinters of the shells which had caused their death, and the injuries\r\nof the wounded, for whom the surgeons on board had, of course, only been\r\nable to provide first aid in the turmoil of battle, were nearly all so\r\nsevere, that they could only be moved slowly.\r\n\r\nAfter the German ships had signalled that they were again ready for\r\naction, those which had the dead and wounded on board, together with\r\nthe German ships put out of action and the captured English ships, were\r\nordered to make for Antwerp. The combined Franco-German fleet, under\r\nthe supreme command of the Prince-Admiral, resumed its voyage in the\r\ndirection of the mouth of the Thames.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\nAT HAMPTON COURT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long rows of windows in Hampton Court Palace were still a blaze of\r\nlight, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. The double post of\r\nthe royal uhlans before the entrance was still busy, for the unceasing\r\narrival and departure of officers of rank of the three allied nations\r\ndemanded military honours. Immediately after the naval engagement at\r\nFlushing, so disastrous to the English, a large French army and some\r\nregiments of the Russian Imperial Guard had landed at Hastings and were\r\nnow quartered at Aldershot, on the best of terms with the French and\r\nthe German troops who had marched from Scotland. The Prince-Admiral’s\r\nheadquarters had been removed to Hampton Court, whose silent, venerable,\r\nand famous palace became suddenly the centre of stirring military and\r\ndiplomatic life.\r\n\r\nAny further serious military operations were hardly considered, for the\r\nsupposition that the landing of large hostile armies would practically\r\nmean the end of the campaign, had proved correct.\r\n\r\nIn the resistance which bodies of English troops had attempted to offer\r\nto the French advance on London, the volunteers had clearly shown\r\ntheir bravery and patriotic devotion; but had been unable to check\r\nthe victorious course of their better-led opponents. Accordingly, an\r\narmistice had been concluded for the purpose of considering the terms of\r\npeace offered by England, even before the German troops advancing from\r\nScotland had had the opportunity of taking part in the land operations.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of peace, eagerly desired by all the civilised nations\r\nof the world, might be considered assured, although, no doubt, its final\r\nratification would be preceded by long and difficult negotiations. The\r\nidea, mooted by the German Imperial Chancellor, of summoning a general\r\ncongress at the Hague, at which not only the belligerents, but all other\r\ncountries should be represented, had met with general approval, since\r\nall the states were interested in the reorganisation of the relations\r\nof the Powers. But the settlement of the preliminaries of peace was\r\nnecessarily the business of the belligerents, and it was for this\r\npurpose that the German Imperial Chancellor, Freiherr von Grubenhagen,\r\nthe French Foreign Minister, M. Delcasse, and the Russian Secretary of\r\nState, M. de Witte, accompanied by Count Lamsdorff, and a full staff of\r\nofficials and diplomatic assistants, had met at Hampton Court Palace.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary negotiations between these statesmen and the English\r\nplenipotentiaries, Mr. Balfour, Prime Minister and First Lord of the\r\nTreasury, and the Marquis of Londonderry, Lord President of the Privy\r\nCouncil, were carried on with restless eagerness. But the strictest\r\nsilence in regard to their results up to the present was observed by all\r\nwho had taken part in them.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Prince-Admiral was an obvious proof that the military\r\nleaders were not inactive, in spite of the commencement of peace\r\nnegotiations. Although he took no part in the diplomatic proceedings and\r\nsimply occupied himself with military affairs, not only every minute\r\nof the day, but a good part of the night, was spent by him in work and\r\ndiscussions with his staff officers, with the chief officers of the land\r\nforces, and with the chief commanders of the allied Franco-Russian army.\r\nEveryone was full of admiration for the Prince’s never-failing vigour\r\nand indefatigable power of work; his tall, slender, Teutonic form, and\r\nfair-bearded face, with the quiet, clear sailor’s eyes, never failed to\r\nimpress all who came in contact with him. Only his imperial brother, who\r\nheld in his hand all the threads of political action, could rival\r\nthe Prince in the traditional Hohenzollern capacity for work at this\r\nimportant time.\r\n\r\nIt was close on midnight when, after a long and lively consultation, the\r\nFrench general, Jeannerod, left the Prince’s study. No sooner had\r\nthe door closed behind him than the adjutant on duty, with an evident\r\nexpression of astonishment in the sound of his voice, announced: “His\r\nExcellency the Imperial Chancellor, Frieherr von Grubenhagen.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince advanced to the middle of the room to meet his visitor and\r\nshook him heartily by the hand.\r\n\r\n“I thank Your Excellency for granting me an interview with you to-day,\r\nalthough it is so late and you are overwhelmed with work. I had a\r\nspecial reason for wishing to confer with you, which you will understand\r\nwhen I tell you that all kinds of rumours have reached me as to\r\nexaggerated demands on the part of our allies. My previous attitude will\r\nhave shown you that I have no intention of interfering in diplomatic\r\nnegotiations, or even exercising my influence in one direction or\r\nanother. I feel that I am here not as a statesman, but simply as a\r\nsoldier; and for that very reason I think you can speak the more openly\r\nto me. I have been told that the complete annihilation of England is\r\nintended as indispensable to the conditions of peace.”\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor, whose manly, determined face showed no signs of\r\nexhaustion, notwithstanding his almost superhuman labours, looked\r\nfrankly at the Prince and shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Your Royal Highness has been incorrectly informed. Neither we nor our\r\nallies have the intention of annihilating England. Certainly we are all\r\nfully agreed that this fearful war must not be waged in vain, and that\r\nthe reward must correspond with the greatness of the sacrifice at which\r\nit has been purchased.”\r\n\r\n“And to whom is the reward to fall?”\r\n\r\n“To all the nations, Your Royal Highness. It would have been a sin to\r\nkindle this universal conflagration had it not been taken for granted\r\nthat its refining flames would prepare the ground for the happiness and\r\npeace of the world. For centuries Great Britain has misused her power\r\nto increase her own wealth at the cost of others. Unscrupulously she\r\ngrabbed everything she could lay hands on, and, injuring at every step\r\nimportant and vital interests of other nations, she challenged that\r\nresistance which has now shattered her position as a power in the world.\r\nThe happiness of the peoples can only be restored by a peace assured\r\nfor years, and only a just division of the dominion of the earth can\r\nguarantee the peace of the world. Therefore England must necessarily\r\nsurrender an essential part of her possessions over sea. Russia wants\r\nthe way free to the Indian Ocean, for only if she has a sufficient\r\nnumber of harbours open all the year round will the enormous riches of\r\nher soil cease to be a lifeless possession. And France--”\r\n\r\n“Let us keep to Russia first, Your Excellency. Has the Russian\r\nGovernment already formulated its demands?”\r\n\r\n“These demands are the essential outcome of the military situation; they\r\nculminate in the cession of British India to Russia. Whatever else our\r\nEastern neighbour may strive to gain, is intended to ensure the peace\r\nof Europe more than her own aggrandisement. The standing danger which\r\nthreatens the peace of Europe from the stormy corner of the old world,\r\nthe Balkan Peninsula, must be finally removed. A fundamental agreement\r\nhas been arrived at between the Powers concerned that the Russian and\r\nAustrian spheres of influence in the Balkans are to be defined in such a\r\nmanner that a definite arrangement of affairs in the Balkan States will\r\nbe the result. There is talk of an independent Kingdom of Macedonia,\r\nunder the rule of an Austrian archduke. The equivalent to be given to\r\nthe Russian Empire as a set-off to this increase of the power of Austria\r\nwill have to be finally settled at the conference at the Hague. But in\r\nany case the dangers which threaten the peace of Europe from Bulgaria,\r\nServia, and Montenegro will be effectually obviated for the future.”\r\n\r\n“But are you not afraid that the Sultan will resist such an agreement,\r\nby which Turkey is essentially the sufferer?”\r\n\r\n“The Sultan will have to yield to the force of circumstances. We must\r\nnot forget, Your Royal Highness, that Turkey has hitherto retained her\r\nEuropean possessions more from the lack of unanimity among the great\r\nPowers than any consecrated rights of the Porte. The unceasing troubles\r\nin Macedonia have shown that the Sultan has neither the power nor the\r\nintention to give the Balkan countries under his rule a government\r\ncorresponding to the demands of modern civilisation. If the Porte loses\r\nthe support it has hitherto received from England, the Sultan is at the\r\nsame time deprived of all possibility of serious resistance.”\r\n\r\n“And what is arranged about Egypt?”\r\n\r\n“Egypt is the prize of victory for France; but only what she can justly\r\nclaim on the ground of a glorious history will be restored to her. The\r\nsovereignty of the Sultan, which is a mere formality, will remain.\r\nBut England’s present position in Egypt--certainly with a definite\r\nlimitation--will henceforth fall to France.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the limitation?”\r\n\r\n“It will be administered, not by France alone, but by an international\r\ncommission, appointed by all the Powers, under the presidency of France,\r\nin the place of the present English administration. The first condition\r\nis that England must cede all her financial claims and her Suez Canal\r\nshares to the allied Powers. These financial sacrifices will at the same\r\ntime be part of the war indemnity which England will have to pay.”\r\n\r\n“Does France raise no further claims?”\r\n\r\n“France is the more satisfied with the results of this war, since an\r\nannexation of Belgium to the French Republic is very probable. Germany,\r\nhowever, claims the harbour of Antwerp, which we have occupied since the\r\nbeginning of the war.”\r\n\r\n“If I am correctly informed, was it not suggested that Aden should fall\r\nto France or be neutralised?”\r\n\r\n“The idea was certainly mooted, but the allied Powers have decided to\r\nleave Aden to England. On the other hand, England will have to pledge\r\nherself to raise no obstacles which would render the construction and\r\nworking of the Bagdad railway illusory. The harbour of Koweit on the\r\nPersian Gulf, the south-eastern terminus of this railway, must remain\r\nthe uncontested possession of Turkey.”\r\n\r\n“And Gibraltar? It raised a storm of indignation in England, when\r\nthe report suddenly spread that the cession of this fortress would be\r\ndemanded.”\r\n\r\n“And yet the English Government will have to submit, for the surrender\r\nof Gibraltar is an indispensable condition on the part of the allies.”\r\n\r\n“It is impossible to rase this natural fortress.”\r\n\r\n“It would suffice if the English garrison were withdrawn, and all the\r\nfortifications dismantled. Gibraltar will cease to exist as a fortress,\r\nand will be restored to Spain on definite conditions. However, as it is\r\nnot the intention of the allies completely to destroy English influence\r\nin the Levant, Malta will continue to form part of the British Empire.\r\nThus England retains in the Mediterranean the most important point\r\nd’appui for her fleet.”\r\n\r\n“It will not be easy to get the English Government to accept\r\nthese conditions. But you have not yet spoken of the demands of\r\nGermany--Antwerp does not touch England’s interests directly.”\r\n\r\n“The policy of the German Government will culminate in ensuring settled\r\ncommercial and political relations with England and her colonies and\r\nthe rounding off of our own colonial possessions. We therefore demand\r\nWalfish Bay for German South-West Africa, the only good harbour, which,\r\nat the present time, being English, is closed to our young South African\r\nColony. Besides this, we must insist upon the East African districts,\r\nwhich we gave up in exchange for Heligoland, being restored to us. This\r\nserious mistake in German policy must be rectified; for the abandonment\r\nof the Protectorate of Zanzibar to England was a blow, which not only\r\nparalysed the zeal of our best colonial friends, but also depreciated\r\nthe value of our East African Colonies.”\r\n\r\n“If I understand you correctly, Your Excellency, your policy is directed\r\ntowards setting Germany’s colonial efforts on a firmer basis.”\r\n\r\n“I certainly regard this as one of the most important demands of our\r\ntime. We must recover what the policy of the last centuries has lost\r\nby neglect. At the same time that Your Royal Highness’s great ancestor\r\nwaged war for seven years for a mere strip of land--for tiny Silesia,\r\nthe far-seeing policy of England succeeded, at a smaller sacrifice, in\r\ngetting possession of enormous tracts of territory far larger in their\r\nwhole extent than the entire continent of Europe.”\r\n\r\n“But for centuries England has been a naval power, and obliged to direct\r\nher efforts to the acquisition of colonies over sea.”\r\n\r\n“And what was there to prevent Prussia, centuries ago, from becoming a\r\nnaval power that should command respect? It was our misfortune that the\r\nmighty ideas and far-seeing plans of the great Elector were frustrated\r\nby the inadequate means at his disposal. Had his successors continued\r\nwhat he had begun, Great Britain’s power would never have been able\r\nto reach such a height. We should have secured in time, in previous\r\ncenturies, our due share of the parts of the world outside Europe.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince looked thoughtfully before him. After a brief silence the\r\nImperial Chancellor continued--\r\n\r\n“Your Royal Highness may have heard that the Netherlands are firmly\r\nresolved, in the interest of self-preservation, to be incorporated with\r\nthe German Empire as a federal state, like Bavaria, Saxony, Wurtemburg,\r\nBaden, and the other German states, after the Franco-German War.\r\nThe rich and extensive Dutch colonies would then also become German\r\ncolonies; that is to say, they would enter into the political union of\r\nthe other German colonies while remaining under the administration of\r\nHolland. Our intention of repairing the wrong done by England to the\r\nBoers has made a very good impression on the Dutch population. The Boer\r\nstates will enter into the same relation to us in which they stood to\r\nEngland before the Boer War, and their independence will be restored to\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Meaning self-government with the recognition of German supremacy.\r\nCertainly, they are kinsmen of the Dutch. But, my dear Baron, will not\r\nthe German people be alarmed at the consequences of an extension of our\r\npossessions over sea? Larger colonial possessions necessitate a larger\r\nfleet. Think of the struggle which the allied Governments had to carry\r\nthrough Parliament even a modest increase in the German fleet!”\r\n\r\n“I am not so much afraid of this difficulty, for the German people have\r\nlearnt the value of the fleet. We have got beyond the tentative stage,\r\nand have paid enough for our experience. We must hold fast what we\r\npossess and recover what we have lost during the last decades through\r\nthe unfortunately unbusiness-like spirit of our foreign policy. Then the\r\nGerman people will have renewed confidence in our colonial policy.”\r\n\r\n“But how will you raise the sums necessary to make our fleet strong and\r\npowerful?”\r\n\r\n“Our negotiations with the friendly Governments of France and Russia are\r\na proof that in these states, just as in the German people, there is\r\na desire for a diminution of the land army; there is an equally strong\r\nfeeling in Italy and Austria. The people would break down under the\r\nburden if the expenses for the army were increased, if we diminish our\r\nland army we shall have the means to increase our naval forces. Now,\r\nafter a victorious war, the moment has come when the whole Continent can\r\nreduce its enormous standing armies to a footing commensurate with the\r\nfinancial capacities of its people. The external enemy is conquered; we\r\nmust not think of conjuring up the internal enemy by laying excessive\r\nburdens on all classes.”\r\n\r\n“You spoke just now of the unbusiness-like spirit of our foreign policy.\r\nHow is this reproach to be understood?”\r\n\r\n“Quite literally, Your Royal Highness! The bargain which gave up\r\nZanzibar to get Heligoland would never have been possible if our\r\ndiplomacy had shown the same far-sightedness and intelligence as\r\nthe English in economic questions, which I can only designate by the\r\nhonourable title of a ‘business-like spirit.’ This business-like spirit\r\nis the mainspring of industry and agriculture, of trade and handicrafts,\r\nas of all industrial life generally, and it is necessary that this\r\nbusiness-like spirit should also be recognised in our ministries as\r\nthe necessary condition for the qualification to judge of the economic\r\ninterests of the people. In this respect our statesmen and officials and\r\nour industrial classes can learn more from our vanquished enemy than\r\nin anything else. England owes her greatness to being ‘a nation of\r\nshopkeepers,’ while our economic development and our external influence\r\nhas been hindered more than anything else by the contempt with which the\r\nindustrial classes have been treated amongst us up to the most recent\r\ntimes. In England the merchant has always stood higher in the social\r\nscale than the officer and official. Amongst us he is looked upon almost\r\nas a second-class citizen compared with the other two. What in England\r\nis valued as only a means to an end is regarded by us as an end in\r\nitself. The spirit of that rigid bureaucracy, of which Prince Bismarck\r\nhas already complained, is still unfortunately with few exceptions the\r\nprevailing spirit in our Empire, from the highest to the lowest circles;\r\nthe lack of appreciation of the importance of economic life is the cause\r\nof the low esteem in which the industrial classes are held. The sound\r\nbusiness-like spirit, which pervades all English state life, cuts the\r\nground from under the feet of Social Democracy in England, while with us\r\nit is gaining ground year by year. I am convinced that our German people\r\nhave no need to fear Social Democracy, for in reforming social cancers\r\nthose who govern are of more importance than those who are governed.”\r\n\r\n“There may be much that is true in what you say, Herr Chancellor. But\r\nthe extension of our colonial possessions will, first and foremost,\r\nbenefit trade, and the merchant will naturally become of greater\r\nimportance with us. There is already talk of great plantation societies\r\nto be started with enormous capital.”\r\n\r\n“It is just against the formation of these societies that I intend to\r\nexert my whole influence, Your Royal Highness. We could commit no more\r\nfatal error than to allow the state-privileged speculation in landed\r\nproperty, which has produced such unwholesome fruits in the old\r\ncivilised states, to exist in our colonies. Real property must be\r\nno object of speculation, it must remain the property of the state.\r\nAgriculture belongs to the classes, who at the present time suffer most\r\nfrom economic depression. Nothing but an increase of the protective\r\nduties can preserve the agricultural population from the threatening\r\ndanger of economic ruin. Increase of protective duty will bring with it\r\nincreased profit, combined with a further increase in the value of land,\r\nwhich is also an article of traffic. Then the increase of land values\r\nwill at the same time create an increase of the rents to be obtained\r\nfrom landed property, and for this reason I cannot help fearing that,\r\nin spite of an increase of protective duties, agriculture will have to\r\nsuffer in the next generation from the further increase in the value of\r\nland and the higher rents that will be the result.\r\n\r\n“In our colonies we must not fall into the same error that has produced\r\nthe socialist question in modern civilised states. The earth belongs to\r\nthose creatures who live on it and by it in accordance with a higher law\r\nthan human imperfection has framed. Therefore the soil of our earth must\r\nbe no object of traffic. Its growth is inseparable from that of the\r\nbody of the state. I dare not hope that it will be allotted to me or my\r\ncontemporaries to solve this question, yet I shall never tire of using\r\nall my influence to prevent at least a false agrarian policy in our\r\nyoung colonies. Injustice dies from its results, for injustice breeds\r\nits own avenger. Mankind committed a fatal wrong in permitting the land\r\nthat supported them to become an object of speculation. This noxious\r\nseed brings noxious fruits to light. It must be the highest task of all\r\ngovernments to carry out land reform--the great problem that decides the\r\ndestiny of a world--by all possible legislative measures. Now that, in\r\nall human probability, peace is assured, now that external dangers\r\nno longer threaten the existence of our Empire, there is nothing to\r\nexonerate us from the serious and sacred obligation to commence the\r\ngreatest and most powerful work of reform that humanity can\r\nundertake. Then our path will lead us--from the conquest of nations to\r\nself-conquests.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door of the room opened, and a royal messenger,\r\nintroduced by the adjutant on duty, handed the Prince a letter decorated\r\nwith the imperial crown and the initial of the imperial name.\r\n\r\nThe first glimmer of dawn entered the open window, and through the tops\r\nof the venerable trees of Hampton Court Park was heard a mysterious\r\nrustling and whispering, as if they were talking of the wonderful\r\nchanges of fortune, of which they had been the mute witnesses since the\r\nremote days of their youth.\r\n\r\nThe blue eyes of the Hohenzollern Prince were shining proudly, while\r\nthey scanned the imperial missive. For a few moments a deep silence\r\nprevailed. Then the Prince turned to the Imperial Chancellor--\r\n\r\n“It will be a great day for us, Your Excellency! His Majesty the Emperor\r\nwill enter London at the head of the allied armies. Peace is assured.\r\nGod grant that it may be the last war which we shall have to wage for\r\nthe future happiness of the German nation!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg’s The Coming Conquest of England, by August Niemann\r\n\r\n***",
