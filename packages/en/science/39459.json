If ever there\r\nwas a future event which might be predicted with absolute certainty, it\r\nwas that Major Cavagnari and his companions would perish precisely as\r\nthey have done. Twice, within forty years, have we invaded Afghanistan,\r\nalthough on both occasions we have frankly avowed that with the\r\ninhabitants of the country we had no cause of quarrel whatever.\r\nNevertheless, we carried fire and sword wherever we went, cutting down\r\ntheir fruit trees, burning their villages, and leaving their women and\r\nchildren shelterless under a winter sky. What could we expect as the\r\nfruit of such acts, except that our victims--knowing, as we did, that\r\nthey were revengeful, passionate, and too ignorant to forecast the\r\nconsequences of their actions--should retaliate in kind the moment that\r\nthey had the opportunity? The first invasion of Afghanistan is now known\r\nby general consent as \"the iniquitous war;\" but it is open to question\r\nif even that war was so elaborately contrived, or so long laboured for\r\nas this--the first act of which has terminated in the slaughter of Major\r\nCavagnari and his escort.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which preceded it are briefly these. For eighteen\r\nmonths Lord Lytton had attempted, by alternate threats and cajolery, to\r\nprevail upon the Ameer Shere Ali to make a surrender of his\r\nindependence, and become a vassal of the Indian Empire. These attempts\r\nhaving failed, war was declared against him on the pretence that he had\r\ninsulted us before all Asia by declining to receive a \"friendly\" mission\r\nsent by the Indian Government. This mission was _not_ friendly. It was\r\nnotorious throughout India that it would go to Kabul charged with an\r\n_ultimatum_ which offered the Ameer the choice of war, or the sacrifice\r\nof his independence. But even this mission the Ameer never refused to\r\nreceive--nay, it is certain that he would have received it if the\r\nopportunity had been given to him, so great was the value he attached to\r\nEnglish friendship. But what the Government of India desired was not the\r\nreception of the mission, but a pretext for making war upon the Ameer.\r\nIt knew that the policy which it meditated in Afghanistan would so\r\ncompletely destroy the sovereignty of the Ameer, that it was impossible\r\nhe should agree to it. At the same time, it was impossible to declare\r\nwar against an independent prince, simply because he declined to divest\r\nhimself of his independence. The war must, somehow or another, be made\r\nto appear as if it were due to some act of the Ameer. Consequently,\r\nalmost from the hour in which the announcement was made that the mission\r\nwas to start, the Ameer was plied with insults and menaces which, if\r\nthey were not intended to drive him to some act of overt hostility, had\r\nno purpose at all. And when these proved unavailing, Lord Lytton\r\ndirected Sir Neville Chamberlain to attempt to force his way through the\r\nKhyber Pass, without waiting for the permission of the Ameer. In the\r\nmost courteous manner the Afghan officer, in command at the Khyber,\r\nintimated to the mission that, without the sanction of his master, it\r\nwas impossible to allow it to proceed; and this refusal was instantly\r\ntelegraphed to England as a deliberate insult which must be wiped out in\r\nblood. From first to last, so far as his conduct towards us is\r\nconcerned, the Ameer was absolutely blameless. During his entire reign\r\nhis consistent endeavour had been to draw closer the ties of amity\r\nbetween himself and us. The Russian mission had forced its way to Kabul,\r\ndespite of all his endeavours to hinder its advance; and there can be no\r\nquestion that but for the previous action of Lord Lytton that mission\r\nwould never have come to Afghanistan. But eighteen months before that\r\noccurrence Lord Lytton had withdrawn our Native Agent from the Court of\r\nthe Ameer. This had been done as a mark of displeasure, and a proof that\r\nno alliance of any kind existed between the two States. This proceeding\r\nLord Lytton followed up by the occupation of Quetta, although he was\r\nwell aware that such an occupation would be interpreted--and rightly--by\r\nthe Ameer, as a menace to his independence, and the harbinger of war. So\r\nit came about that when the Russian mission knocked for admission at the\r\ndoors of his capital, the Ameer found himself on the one side threatened\r\nby Russia, and on the other abandoned and threatened by Lord Lytton.\r\nLord Lytton, in point of fact, is as directly responsible for the entry\r\nof the Russian mission to Kabul as he is for the dispatch of his own.\r\n\r\nBut if Lord Lytton's treatment of the Ameer was cruel and ungenerous,\r\ncriminal, at least to an equal extent, was his treatment of the people\r\nover whom he ruled. At that time there was an appalling amount of\r\nsuffering all over India. The country had been ravaged by a series of\r\nfamines. In the Punjab prices were abnormally high. The North-West\r\nProvinces were still unrecovered from a dearth, during which the\r\nGovernment of India had exhibited a rapacity and indifference to human\r\nsuffering which would, with difficulty, be credited in England. Terrible\r\nas is the mortality resulting from a famine in India, the death-roll\r\nrepresents but a tenth part of the suffering which such visitations\r\ninflict. For every human being that dies, ten are left, without money\r\nand without physical strength, to struggle feebly for existence on the\r\nmargin of the grave. They cannot give a fair day's work for a fair day's\r\nwage. They may reckon themselves fortunate if their enfeebled powers can\r\nearn just sufficient to keep body and soul together. For all these\r\nwretched beings--and last year in Upper India they numbered many\r\nmillions--the smallest rise of price in the necessities of life means\r\ndeath from hunger. A war, therefore, with the enormous rise of prices\r\nwhich it would immediately produce, was nothing less than a sentence of\r\ntorture and death passed upon tens of thousands of our own subjects.\r\nUndeterred, however, by the warnings of experience, deaf to\r\nconsiderations of humanity and justice, the Government of India started\r\non its wild-goose chase after a \"Scientific Frontier.\" The victims whom\r\nit trampled to death in this mad chase have never been numbered--they\r\nnever can be numbered. The Afghans who died in defence of their village\r\nhomes form but a hundredth part of them. The residue was composed of our\r\nown mute and uncomplaining subjects.\r\n\r\nA war thus wantonly commenced resulted in a failure as ignominious as it\r\ndeserved. Long before the Treaty of Gundamuck the ambitious policy of\r\nthe Government had become an object of contempt and ridicule all over\r\nIndia. It was known that Lord Lytton and his advisers were at their\r\nwit's end to discover something which might be made to do duty as a\r\n\"Scientific Frontier,\" and so bring a misjudged enterprise to a\r\nconclusion. But it is the peculiarity of our Ministers to believe that\r\nthey can arrest the inexorable sequence of cause and effect by a\r\ndexterous manipulation of the faculty of speech. Lord Beaconsfield\r\nappears to have imparted to his colleagues his own belief in the\r\nomnipotence of phrases to remove mountains, and make rough places\r\nsmooth. So the Treaty of Gundamuck was no sooner signed than Ministers\r\nand Ministerial journals raised a great hymn of triumph over the\r\nwondrous things which they had wrought in Afghanistan. The one solid\r\nnational advantage to be derived from the sacrifice of Cavagnari and his\r\ncomrades, is that this method of treating facts will have to be laid\r\naside. Lord Lytton is not likely to appeal again to his \"carefully\r\nverified facts\" as a proof that he is a much wiser man than Lord\r\nLawrence. Lord Cranbrook will not again express his conviction that the\r\n\"objections (to an English Resident) expressed by Shere Ali will be\r\nshown to have been without substantial foundation.\" Yakoub Khan and his\r\nfive attendants are all that remain of that \"strong, friendly, and\r\nindependent Afghanistan\" which Mr. Stanhope informed the House of\r\nCommons had been created by the war. The anguished cry of the _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ \"for a punishment which shall ring from end to end of the\r\nContinent of Asia\" is the latest expression of the \"results incalculably\r\nbeneficial to the two countries\" which, according to Lord Lytton, were\r\nto flow from the Peace of Gundamuck.\r\n\r\nA failure in policy more signal and more complete than this it is\r\nimpossible to imagine. But it is to be noted that the Ministerial\r\njournals are doing their utmost to save the \"Scientific Frontier\" from\r\nthe destruction which has overtaken the projects of the Ministry. And so\r\nlong as a belief in this Frontier is cherished anywhere, the return to a\r\nsafe and rational policy is obstructed. In the following pages,\r\ntherefore, I shall, firstly, endeavour to show that the (so-called)\r\n\"Scientific Frontier\" is as purely fictitious as the \"strong, friendly,\r\nand independent Afghanistan\" which we were told had been created out of\r\nchaos by means of the war. And, secondly, I shall discuss the various\r\nlines of conduct which lie open to us, when we have occupied Kabul, in\r\norder to determine which is best fitted to ensure the stability of our\r\nIndian Empire and the contentment of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scientific Frontier.\r\n\r\nIn all the discussions on this Frontier question, a very obvious, but\r\nall-important, fact has been persistently forgotten. It is that British\r\nrule in India is a rule based upon military supremacy; and that,\r\ntherefore, our Indian army--English as well as native--is primarily a\r\ngarrison, having its duties upon the places where it is quartered. We\r\ncould not withdraw our troops from any part of India without incurring\r\nthe risk of an outbreak in the districts thus denuded. The \"Punjab\r\nFrontier Force\" has always been a force distinct from the \"Army of\r\nIndia,\" and recognized as having special duties of its own. So far as I\r\nknow, in the discussions on a \"Scientific Frontier\" no reference has\r\nbeen made to the above circumstance. The Indian army has been spoken of\r\nas if it were so much fighting power, which we were free to concentrate\r\nat any point we pleased. And to this oversight is due the hallucination\r\nthat an improved frontier would enable us to diminish the strength of\r\nthe Indian garrison (properly so called). The fact is, that before this\r\nlast war we had almost the very frontier which our situation in India\r\nrequired. If the authority of the Ameer had extended up to the\r\nboundaries of our Empire, troubles between the two States must have\r\noccurred, resulting inevitably in the extinction of the weaker. The evil\r\nof such an extension of territory no one denies; we should not only have\r\nhad to hold Afghanistan with a strong garrison--certainly not less than\r\ntwenty thousand men--but we should have been compelled to maintain a\r\nfrontier force, to guard against aggression from without, either from\r\nRussia or Persia. Forty thousand men would have been needed for this\r\ndouble duty, in addition to the pre-existing garrison of India. But by a\r\npiece of supreme good fortune the authority of the Ameer did not begin\r\nwhere ours left off. Between us and him were interposed the tribes which\r\ndwell in the hills along our North-Western frontier. These tribes\r\nacknowledged allegiance neither to him nor to us. Broken up and divided\r\namongst themselves, the worst they could inflict upon us was an\r\noccasional raid into our territories; and these we could repress without\r\nhaving to call the Ameer to an account for the lawlessness of his\r\nsubjects. A few regiments of horse and foot were all that we needed for\r\nthe defence of our frontier; while as against foreign invasion we\r\npossessed a frontier that needed no defence at all. That frontier\r\nconsisted of the foodless deserts and inaccessible hills of Afghanistan.\r\nThese were impenetrable to an invader, so long as we retained the\r\nfriendship and the confidence of the people who dwell among them.\r\nConsequently, to quote the language of Sir Henry Rawlinson, \"our main\r\nobject has ever been, since the date of Lord Auckland's famous Simla\r\nManifesto of 1838, to obtain the establishment of a strong, friendly,\r\nand independent Power on the North-Western frontier of India, without,\r\nhowever, accepting any crushing liabilities in return.\" We all know the\r\nmanner in which Lord Auckland set about obtaining the \"strong, friendly,\r\nand independent Power,\" and the \"crushing liabilities\" we had to accept\r\nin consequence. Tutored by experience, we adopted a wiser and more\r\nrighteous policy, which was producing admirable results.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of establishing a stable friendship with Afghanistan\r\narises from the character of the people. It is the habitation, not of a\r\nnation, but of a collection of tribes, and the nominal ruler of\r\nAfghanistan is never more than the ruler of a party which, for the time,\r\nchances to be strongest. Consequently there never existed an authority,\r\nrecognized as legitimate throughout the country, with which we could\r\nenter into diplomatic relations. At the same time, their divided\r\ncondition crippled the Afghans for all offensive purposes. We had,\r\ntherefore, nothing to fear in the way of unprovoked aggression, and our\r\nobvious policy was to win the confidence of these wild tribes and their\r\nchiefs, by carefully abstaining from encroachments on their\r\nindependence. Such, in fact, has been the policy which every\r\nGovernor-General has pursued in the interval which divides the\r\n\"plundering and blundering\" of Lord Auckland from the like achievements\r\nof Lord Lytton. And it had been attended with the greater success,\r\nbecause under the firm guidance of two remarkable men, Afghanistan had\r\nprogressed considerably towards the status of an organized kingdom.\r\nShere Ali had diligently trod in the footsteps of his father, the Dost,\r\nand it is in these terms that the Government of India describes the rule\r\nand policy of the Ameer in the year 1876:\r\n\r\n    \"Those officers of our Government who are best acquainted with the\r\n    affairs of Afghanistan, and the character of the Ameer and his\r\n    people, consider that the hypothesis that the Ameer may be\r\n    intimidated or corrupted by Russia (even supposing there was any\r\n    probability of such an attempt being made) is opposed to his\r\n    personal character and to the feelings and traditions of his race,\r\n    and that any attempt to intrigue with factions in Afghanistan,\r\n    opposed to the Ameer, would defeat itself, and afford the Ameer the\r\n    strongest motive for at once disclosing to us such proceedings.\r\n    Whatever may be the discontent created in Afghanistan by taxation,\r\n    conscription, and other unpopular measures, _there can be no\r\n    question that the power of the Ameer Shere Ali Khan has been\r\n    consolidated throughout Afghanistan in a manner unknown since the\r\n    days of Dost Mahomed, and that the officers entrusted with the\r\n    administration have shown extraordinary loyalty and devotion to the\r\n    Ameer's cause_. It was probably the knowledge of the Ameer's\r\n    strength that kept the people aloof from Yakoub Khan, in spite of\r\n    his popularity. At all events, Herat fell to the Ameer without a\r\n    blow. The rebellion in Salpoora in the extreme West was soon\r\n    extinguished. The disturbances in Budukshan in the North were\r\n    speedily suppressed. _Nowhere has intrigue or rebellion been able to\r\n    make head in the Ameer's dominions._ Even the Char Eimak and the\r\n    Hazara tribes are learning to appreciate the advantages of a firm\r\n    rule.... But what we wish specially to repeat is that, from the date\r\n    of the Umballa Durbar to the present time, _the Ameer has\r\n    unreservedly accepted and acted upon our advice to maintain a\r\n    peaceful attitude towards his neighbours_. We have no reason to\r\n    believe that his views are changed.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"strong, friendly, and independent Power\"--this edifice of order\r\nand increasing stability--the British Government deliberately destroyed\r\nin the insane expectation of finding a \"Scientific Frontier\" hidden\r\nsomewhere in the ruins. It is difficult to conceive of an action more\r\nimpolitic or more cruel. In a month the labours of forty years were\r\nobliterated, old hatreds rekindled, and the wounds of 1838, which the\r\nwise and gentle treatment of former Viceroys had almost healed, were\r\nopened afresh.\r\n\r\nWe come next to the inquiry as to what this \"Scientific Frontier\" is, in\r\norder to obtain which this act of vandalism was perpetrated. This is a\r\nquestion involved in some obscurity. The _Times_ is the great champion\r\nof the \"Scientific Frontier,\" but in its columns, as also in Ministerial\r\nspeeches, it changes colour like a chameleon. Sometimes it is called the\r\n\"possession of the three highways leading to India,\" thereby rendering\r\nthe Empire \"invulnerable.\" At other times it is recommended to us\r\nbecause it protects the trade through the Bolan Pass, and enables us to\r\nthreaten Kabul. The fact is that the (so-called) \"Scientific\r\nFrontier\"--meaning thereby the frontier we acquired by the Treaty of\r\nGundamuck--is a make-believe, an imposture. It is not the \"Scientific\r\nFrontier\" in pursuit of which we \"hunted the Ameer to death\" and reduced\r\nhis territories to a condition of anarchy.\r\n\r\nThose who have followed the history of the war with attention will\r\nremember that in September of last year the Calcutta correspondent of\r\nthe _Times_ was smitten with a really marvellous admiration for Lord\r\nLytton. \"India,\" he wrote, \"is fortunate in the possession at the\r\npresent time of a Viceroy specially gifted with broad statesmanlike\r\nviews, the result partly of most vigilant and profound study, partly of\r\nthe application of great natural intellectual capacity to the close\r\ncultivation of political science and the highest order of statecraft.\"\r\nHere we have the portrait of the lion painted by himself; and it is not\r\nsurprising that this superb creature should have regarded with\r\nconsiderable scorn the policy of his predecessors who never claimed to\r\nbe \"specially gifted\" for the exercise of \"the highest order of\r\nstatecraft.\" \"The present measure,\" the correspondent went on to say,\r\n\"for the despatch of a mission to Kabul forms but a single move in an\r\nextensive concerted scheme for the protection of India, which is the\r\noutcome of a long-devised and elaborately worked-out system of defensive\r\npolicy.\" Here we have a fine example of the \"puff preliminary.\" In the\r\nissue of the _Times_ for the 10th September this \"extensive concerted\r\nscheme for the protection of India\" is detailed at length, and is there\r\nplainly set forth as intended for a barrier against Russia:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Indian Government are most anxious to avoid adopting any policy\r\n    which would bear even the semblance of hostility towards Russia, but\r\n    the extreme probability of a collision sooner or later cannot be\r\n    overlooked. It is necessary, therefore, to provide for a strong\r\n    defensive position to guard against eventualities. From this point\r\n    of view it is indispensable that we should possess a commanding\r\n    influence over the triangle of territory formed on the map by Kabul,\r\n    Ghuznee, and Jellalabad, together with power over the Hindoo\r\n    Khosh.... This triangle we may hope to command with Afghan\r\n    concurrence if the Ameer is friendly. The strongest frontier line\r\n    which could be adopted would be along the Hindoo Khosh, from Pamir\r\n    to Bamian, thence to the south by the Helmund, Girishk, and\r\n    Kandahar, to the Arabian Sea. It is possible, therefore, that by\r\n    friendly negotiations some such defensive boundary may be adopted.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the moderate designs entertained by the Indian Government when\r\nthey dispatched what they called a \"friendly mission\" to the Court of\r\nthe Ameer. If Lord Lytton imagined that \"friendly negotiations\" would\r\nobtain these tremendous concessions from the Ameer, it would show that a\r\ntraining in \"the highest order of statecraft\" does not preserve even a\r\n\"specially gifted\" Viceroy from the credulousness of an infant. But his\r\nacts show that he entertained no such belief. He felt, as every one must\r\nfeel who reads the extract I have made, that demands such as these must\r\nbe preceded by a war. Hence the menacing letters addressed to the Ameer;\r\nhence the rude and insulting manner in which Sir Neville Chamberlain was\r\nordered to attempt an entrance into Afghanistan without awaiting the\r\npermission of the Ameer; and hence, finally, the monstrous fiction of a\r\ndeliberate \"insult\" inflicted upon us, when, in point of fact, we had\r\nbeen the \"insulters\" all along. The obvious intention throughout was to\r\nobtain a pretext for declaring war, because without a war the\r\n\"Scientific Frontier\" was manifestly unattainable. Lastly, when war had\r\nbeen determined upon, the same \"official\" correspondent came forward in\r\nthe _Times_ to make known the objects of the impending campaign. \"We\r\nhave,\" he wrote, \"been driven into what will probably be a costly war\r\nentirely against our will, and all our endeavours to avoid it. The\r\noccasion, therefore, will now be seized to secure for ourselves the\r\nvarious passes piercing the mountain ranges along the whole frontier\r\nfrom the Khyber to the Bolan; and further _strategic measures will be\r\nadopted to dominate entirely the Suleiman range and the Hindoo Khosh_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to admire the hardihood of this remarkable\r\ncorrespondent when he alleges that the war was \"entirely against our\r\nwill, and all our endeavours to avoid it.\" But this is not the matter\r\nwith which I am at present concerned. The official character of these\r\ncommunications will be denied by no one, and they make it clear that the\r\n\"Scientific Frontier\" was intended as a barrier against Russia, and\r\nwould have made the Hindoo Khosh the external boundary of the Indian\r\nEmpire. Such a frontier is manifestly the dream of a military\r\nspecialist, to whose mental vision the Indian Empire, with all its\r\ndiverse interests, has no existence except as a frontier to be defended\r\nagainst the Russians. And it illustrates the ignorance and precipitate\r\nfolly which has plunged us in our present difficulties that a project so\r\nwild should have been seriously entertained. To have carried it out the\r\nsubjugation of Afghanistan would have been an indispensable preliminary,\r\nand then the civilizing of it, by means of a system of roads and strong\r\ngarrisons throughout the country; the entire cost of these vast\r\noperations being defrayed by a country already taxed to the last point\r\nof endurance, heavily burdened with an increasing debt, and ravaged by\r\nperiodical famines. Such, however, was the \"Scientific Frontier\" for\r\nwhich a \"specially gifted Viceroy,\" trained in \"the highest order of\r\npolitical statecraft,\" declared war against the Ameer. But the frontier\r\nwhich we obtained at the close of the war, and which Ministers and\r\nMinisterial journals would have us believe is the genuine article which\r\nthey wanted from the beginning, is not only not this frontier, but it\r\nhas not the smallest resemblance to it.\r\n\r\nThe new frontier does not differ from the old except in three\r\nparticulars. We hold the Khyber Pass as far as Lundi Kotal, and we have\r\nacquired the right to quarter troops in the Kurram Valley and the Valley\r\nof Peshin. Of these the Kurram Valley is a mere _cul-de-sac_, leading\r\nnowhere. But I will not ask of my readers to accept of my judgment on\r\nthis matter. Among the best known advocates for a forward and aggressive\r\npolicy in Afghanistan is Dr. Bellew. An accomplished linguist and an\r\nexperienced traveller, he accompanied Colonel Lumsden's mission to\r\nKandahar in 1857; he was also a member of the mission entrusted with the\r\nsettlement of the Seistan boundary question, and no man living is better\r\nacquainted with the geography and people of Afghanistan. I believe it\r\nwill not be denied that Lord Lytton, during the recent war, trusted\r\nlargely in his knowledge and suggestions. He has thus expressed himself\r\non the policy of occupying the Kurram Valley:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Kurram Valley would involve the addition of about one hundred\r\n    and fifty miles of hill frontage to our border, and would bring us\r\n    into contact with the independent Orakzais, Zaimukhts, Toris,\r\n    Cabul-Khel, Waziris, and others, against whose hostility and inroads\r\n    here, as in other parts of the border, we should have to protect our\r\n    territory. By its possession, as we are now situated, we should be\r\n    committed to the defence of a long narrow strip of land, a perfect\r\n    _cul-de-sac_ in the hills, hemmed in by a number of turbulent\r\n    robber-tribes, who are under no control, and acknowledge no\r\n    authority. In ordinary times its acquisition would add to the\r\n    serious difficulties of our position. In times of trouble or\r\n    disturbance on the border, its possession would prove a positive\r\n    source of weakness, a dead weight upon our free action. In it we\r\n    should run the risk of being hemmed in by our foes in the\r\n    overhanging hills around, of being cut off from our communications\r\n    with the garrison of Kohat, by the Orakzais on the one side, by the\r\n    Waziris on the other. These are the disadvantages of the step. In\r\n    return what advantages should we derive? Not one. With Kurram in our\r\n    possession we certainly could not flank either the Khyber or the\r\n    Goleri Pass, because between it and the one, intervenes the\r\n    impassable snowy range of Sufed Koh; and between it and the other,\r\n    intervenes the vast routeless hilly tract of the Waziris. From\r\n    Kurram we could neither command Kabul nor Ghazni, because the route\r\n    to either is by a several days' march, over stupendous hills and\r\n    tortuous defiles, in comparison with which the historical Khyber and\r\n    Bolan Passes, or even the less widely-known Goleri Pass, are as\r\n    king's highways.\"\r\n\r\nThis, I think, is sufficient to dispose of the Kurram Valley. If the old\r\nfrontier has been rendered \"invulnerable,\" it is not the acquisition of\r\nthe Kurram Valley which has made it so. There remains the Peshin Valley.\r\nThis valley is an open tract of country lying almost midway on the line\r\nof march between Quetta and Kandahar, but nearer to the former than the\r\nlatter. Three easy marches from Quetta suffice to place a traveller in\r\nthe centre of it. It cannot accurately be described as an extension of\r\nour frontier, because it is dissevered from it by more than two hundred\r\nmiles of difficult country. Between the valley and British territory,\r\nthe lands of the Khan of Khelat are interposed in one direction, and\r\nnumerous robber-tribes--Kakers, Murrees, Bhoogtees--in another. Until\r\nthe valley is securely linked to the Indus by a railway from Sukkur to\r\nthe Bolan Pass--a costly work, which could not be executed in less than\r\nseven years--it will be impossible to quarter more than a few thousand\r\nmen in it--and these for six months of the year will be as completely\r\ndetached from their base of supply and reinforcement in India, as if a\r\ntract of empty space ran between them. So far from ensuring any\r\nincreased security to India by our premature occupation of this valley,\r\nwe have only enhanced the chances of a hostile collision with the rulers\r\nand people of Afghanistan. We were already in military occupation of\r\nQuetta, and until easy and rapid communication had been established\r\nbetween Quetta and the Indus, nothing was to be gained by a yet further\r\nadvance from our base. As a barrier against Russia this frontier is\r\nwithout meaning, and no better proof of this fact could be adduced than\r\nSir Henry Rawlinson's commentary upon its merits in the Article on the\r\n\"Results of the Afghan War\" which recently appeared in the _Nineteenth\r\nCentury_:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Afghan settlement is a very good settlement as far as it goes,\r\n    but it is not immaculate--_it is not complete_. To yield us its full\r\n    measure of defence, the Treaty must be supplemented by all\r\n    legitimate precautions and supports. _Persia must be detached from\r\n    Russia coûte que coûte._ Russia herself must not be left in any\r\n    uncertainty as to our intentions. She must be made to understand ...\r\n    _that she will not be permitted unopposed to establish herself in\r\n    strength ... even at Abiverd_, nor to commence intrigues against the\r\n    British power in India. She might indeed be warned that, if\r\n    necessary, we were prepared in self-defence to support the\r\n    Turcomans--with whom she has no legitimate quarrel--with arms or\r\n    money, or even to turn the tables on her by encouraging the efforts\r\n    of the Uzbegs to recover their liberty.... _It would be almost\r\n    fatuity at such a moment to withdraw our garrison from Candahar...._\r\n    Yacub Khan must be made to see that it is as much for his interest\r\n    as our own to hold an efficient body of troops in such a position\r\n    that, on the approach of danger ... _they might, with military\r\n    alacrity, occupy Herat as an auxiliary garrison_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what is implied in detaching Persia from Russia he explains in\r\nanother part of his Essay.\r\n\r\n    \"If Russia, as there is strong reason to believe, is now pushing on\r\n    to Merv or Sarakhs ... with the ultimate hope of occupying Herat,\r\n    then it might very possibly be a sound policy to extend to Persia\r\n    the provisions of the Asia Minor Protectorate, or even to support\r\n    her actively in vindicating her rights upon the frontier of\r\n    Khorassán.\"\r\n\r\nFrom all which it would appear that our \"Scientific Frontier\" is simply\r\ngood for nothing until it has been supplemented by an offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance with the barbarian enemies of Russia all over the\r\nworld. In order to ensure the safety of India, we must protect not only\r\nour own \"Scientific Frontier,\" but we must guarantee the Sultan all his\r\nAsiatic possessions; we must be ready at any moment to fight for the\r\n\"integrity and independence\" of Persia; we must be prepared to march our\r\ntroops to Herat, and to show a front against the Russians on the Oxus;\r\nwe must provide the Tekeh-Turcomans with arms and money, and assist the\r\nUzbegs in their attempts to recover their liberty. Such are the\r\n\"legitimate precautions and supports\" which are requisite to render the\r\nnew frontier immaculate and complete. But if with a \"Scientific\r\nFrontier\" we remain liable to such tremendous demands as these, it\r\npasses imagination to conjecture in what respect we could have been\r\nworse off when our frontier was \"haphazard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Circumstances of the Peace.\r\n\r\nI shall next endeavour to show the circumstances which compelled the\r\nIndian Government to acquiesce in a peace which thus left the avowed\r\nobject of the war unfulfilled. The preparations for the invasion of\r\nAfghanistan were on a scale corresponding to the magnitude of the\r\nenterprise as explained by the \"official\" correspondent of the _Times_.\r\nTroops were set in motion for the North-West frontier from garrisons in\r\nthe extreme south of India. Men were sent from England to man heavy gun\r\nbatteries. In addition to the troops under General Roberts, no less than\r\nthree columns were formed to invade Afghanistan viâ Sukkur and the\r\nBolan, and the same number to advance through the Khyber. The force\r\nwhich marched to Kandahar was supplied with four heavy gun batteries,\r\nand a fifth was sent up subsequently, although, except upon the\r\nsupposition that permanent entrenched camps were to be formed in\r\nAfghanistan, these heavy guns were simply an encumbrance and a source of\r\ndanger. But the campaign had barely commenced before the Government\r\nbecame aware that it had utterly miscalculated its cost and difficulty.\r\nIt is easy enough for an army to enter Afghanistan; it is next to\r\nimpossible for it to subsist when it has got there. It is easy enough to\r\nscatter the Afghans when collected in battle array; it is next to\r\nimpossible to subjugate them because they never are _so_ collected. From\r\nthese causes our raid into Afghanistan was but little removed from an\r\nignominious failure. If we had not made peace we should have been\r\ncompelled to evacuate the country from the enormous costliness of\r\nretaining troops in it. Under such circumstances, a peace was needed too\r\nurgently to allow the Government to stand out for any extraordinary\r\nconcessions. They took what they could get, which proved to be, as we\r\nhave seen, the right to place garrisons in the two valleys of Kurram and\r\nPeshin. But having gone to war in search of a \"Scientific Frontier,\" no\r\nalternative was left to them except to frankly confess that they had not\r\nfound it; or to affirm that these two valleys constituted it.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the causes of our failure. These are all-important, and\r\nought to dissipate for ever the fear of an invasion of India by Russia\r\nor any other Power. The plan of the campaign required that Afghanistan\r\nshould be invaded from three points; but the most important operation\r\nwas understood to be the advance of General Stewart upon Kandahar. As\r\nsoon as hostilities appeared inevitable, a small force under General\r\nBiddulph had been sent forward to secure Quetta against a sudden attack.\r\nGeneral Stewart followed later on, and the two columns numbered upon\r\npaper about 20,000 men, with 60 guns. Meanwhile, a third column was\r\nordered to assemble at Sukkur in support, and placed under the command\r\nof General Primrose. These extensive preparations were supposed to\r\nindicate the determination of the Indian Government to push on as far as\r\nHerat. The distance which had to be traversed between Sukkur and\r\nKandahar is, roughly speaking, about four hundred miles, but the country\r\npresents extraordinary difficulties. From Sukkur to Jacobabad extends a\r\nlevel tract which, during the rains, is flooded to a depth of seven\r\nfeet. Between Jacobabad and Dadur--a town situated at the entrance of\r\nthe Bolan Pass--extends the Sinde desert. Any large force marching\r\nacross this desert would have to take with them, not only food and\r\nforage, but water, for only at intervals of fifteen or twenty miles is\r\nthe parched and barren soil pierced by a few brackish springs, which\r\njust suffice for the needs of the hamlets which have sprung up around\r\nthem. For six months of the year this desert is literally impassable. A\r\nhot wind sweeps across it, which is fatal to man and beast. Only once\r\ndid the Indian Government venture to send troops across it after this\r\n\"blast of death\" (as the natives call it) had begun to blow. This was in\r\nthe last Afghan war. Some hundreds of native troops were sent as an\r\nescort in charge of supplies, and in four days one hundred Sepoys\r\nperished, three hundred camp followers, and (I think) nine officers out\r\nof fourteen. Beyond Dadur is the Bolan Pass. This Pass is about eighty\r\nmiles in length; regular road there is none; what purports to be a road\r\nis merely the bed of a stream, which, during the rainy weather, is\r\nfilled from bank to bank with a volume of rushing water. Neither food\r\nnor forage is obtainable in the Pass, and even the camels, when starting\r\nfrom Dadur, had to carry a seven days' supply of food for themselves.\r\nBetween Quetta and Kandahar the country is open, but neither is food\r\nprocurable for a large force, nor forage for the horses and camels. From\r\nfirst to last General Stewart's troops were almost wholly fed from\r\nIndia. The winter, luckily, was one of unprecedented mildness. But for\r\nthis, in place of a march upon Kandahar, a terrible catastrophe could\r\nhardly have been averted. In ordinary seasons the snows fall heavily in\r\nand around Quetta early in November, and the cold is intense. The Bolan\r\nPass is swept from end to end by hurricanes of wind and rain and snow.\r\nAt the very time when these storms usually occur we had a dozen\r\nregiments and batteries straggling along the whole length of the Bolan\r\nPass. Last year, however, there was neither snow nor hurricane, and our\r\ntroops got through the Pass in safety. There was no opposition offered\r\nto our advance on Kandahar, but, from the want of food and the hardships\r\nwhich had to be endured, no less than twenty thousand camels perished\r\nupon the march. This mortality decided the campaign. When General\r\nStewart reached Kandahar the situation was as follows:--The magazines at\r\nQuetta were nearly empty. Four months' food was collected at Sukkur, but\r\nawaited carriage for its transport to Quetta. The third column under\r\nGeneral Primrose was assembling on the Indus, and needed ten thousand\r\ncamels to enable it to advance. To supply all these wants there were at\r\nSukkur about 1600 camels. In order to lessen the pressure on the\r\nCommissariat, General Stewart divided his forces, despatching one column\r\nto hunt for supplies in the direction of Giriskh, and sending another\r\nwith the same object to Khelat-i-Ghilzie. These movements caused the\r\ndeath from cold and hunger of a large additional number of camels, and\r\ndemonstrated that there was not food in that part of Afghanistan\r\nsufficient for a force so large as that collected at Kandahar. Sinde,\r\nmeanwhile, had been swept so bare of camels that it was impossible to\r\ncollect a sufficient number for the carriage of food to Quetta before\r\nthe hot weather had set in, and the march across the desert was barred\r\nby \"the blast of death.\" Immediate action was necessary if General\r\nStewart's troops were not to starve; and eight thousand men returned to\r\nIndia, reducing the garrison left at Kandahar to four thousand. This\r\nnumber, it was trusted, the Commissariat would be able to feed during\r\nthe hot weather. But even this small force was so scantily supplied with\r\ncarriage that it could not have moved, in a body, for fifty miles in any\r\ndirection. It was, so to speak, nailed to the spot on which it was\r\nencamped. This want of food, far more than the physical difficulties of\r\nthe country, is and always will be the insuperable obstacle to carrying\r\non extensive military operations in Afghanistan. The people obtain no\r\nmore from the soil than just suffices for their own wants; and for days\r\ntogether an invading army has to pass over huge wastes with hardly a\r\ntrace of human habitation, and consequently destitute of food.\r\n\r\nNot a little amusing was the revulsion of feeling caused throughout\r\nIndia by the lame and impotent conclusion of the advance on Kandahar. It\r\nwas a demonstration of the impossibility of an invasion which convinced\r\nthose who were most reluctant to be convinced. If when we had all India\r\nfrom which to draw our supplies, and with no enemy to oppose us, our\r\nutmost efforts had merely sufficed to place four thousand men in\r\nKandahar, and leave them there, isolated and defenceless, it was\r\nchimerical to suppose that the Russians could march for double that\r\ndistance an army capable of attempting the conquest of India.\r\n\"Kandahar,\" writes a military correspondent to the _Pioneer_--the\r\nofficial journal of India--\"is acknowledged to be a mistake, and it is\r\nhoped that a British army will never again be dispatched in that\r\ndirection; it is a mere waste of men, money, and means, and an\r\nunsuitable line for either attack or defence.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the _Pioneer_, the very purpose of whose existence is to preach the\r\ninfallibility of the Indian Government, thus endorses the remarks of its\r\ncorrespondent: \"The theories about Kandahar are by this time exploded;\r\nindeed, there are many critics who have refused to adopt them from the\r\nvery beginning; believing against General Hamley, that the main road\r\ninto Afghanistan, whether we march as defenders of the Kabul Ameer or as\r\navengers, must lie past Peshawur and Jelalabad.\"\r\n\r\nThe failure on the Kandahar side placed the Indian Government in an\r\nextremely difficult position. An advance on Herat was plainly out of the\r\nquestion; even one on Ghuznee was beyond the power of General Stewart\r\nand his troops. Elsewhere the aspect of affairs was hardly less\r\ncheering. The expedition in the Kurram Valley had resulted in the\r\nsomewhat ignominious retreat out of Khost. We had about 15,000 men\r\nholding the line from the Khyber to Jelalabad; but in effecting this,\r\n14,000 camels had perished, and several of the regiments had been more\r\nthan decimated from sickness and exposure. We had not subjugated a rood\r\nof territory on which our troops were not actually encamped. The main\r\nstrength of the Ameer's army was untouched, while all along our\r\nTrans-Indus frontier the hill tribes were in a state of dangerous\r\nunrest. The hot weather was coming on apace, when cholera and typhoid\r\nfever would be added to the number of our enemies. Thirty thousand\r\ntroops had been set in motion, the garrisons in the interior of India\r\ndangerously weakened; three millions of money expended; and this was all\r\nthat had been achieved. If now Yakoub Khan refused to come to terms,\r\nwhat was to be done? General Brown might be ordered to force his way\r\nfrom Jelalabad to Kabul, but what was he to do when he got there? The\r\ncost in money would be certainly heavy--the cost in men, not improbably,\r\nheavy also. And if, on our arrival at his capital, Yakoub Khan retired\r\nto either Balkh or Herat, we were powerless to follow him. Yakoub Khan,\r\nin fact, had the game in his hands. We had shot our bolt and failed. He\r\nhad simply to decline to make peace, and keep out of our reach. We\r\nshould then have been compelled either to evacuate the country, or to\r\noccupy it with the certainty that a little later on we should be\r\ncompelled to withdraw, when the drain on the finances of India became\r\ntoo heavy to endure. Sir Henry Rawlinson rightly says, that a very small\r\nforce can march from one end of Afghanistan to another; but a very large\r\nforce is requisite permanently to hold it. The tribal divisions which\r\nhinder unity of resistance hinder also the achievement of any decisive\r\nvictory. Each tribe is an independent centre of life, which requires a\r\nseparate operation for its extinction.\r\n\r\nSuch was the dilemma in which the Government found themselves involved.\r\nIt was almost equally disastrous either to withdraw or to advance. If\r\nthe troops were withdrawn, they would return burdened with the ignominy\r\nof failure. If they advanced, it would be into a tangle of military and\r\npolitical embarrassments, the issue of which it was impossible to\r\nforesee. There was only one way of escape possible, and that was to\r\nrelinquish the ambitious projects from which the war originated, and\r\nacquiesce in any settlement which the adversary would agree to. The\r\nresult was the Treaty with Yakoub Khan--a Treaty which I have no\r\nhesitation in saying has placed in peril the existence of our Indian\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, impossible to account for the infatuation or the\r\nobstinacy which caused the Indian Government to stipulate for the\r\nreception of an undefended British Envoy at the Court of a prince in the\r\nposition of Yakoub Khan. It would have been so easy to have introduced a\r\nclause in the Treaty, to the effect that as soon as Yakoub Khan's\r\nauthority was firmly established an English Envoy should be accredited\r\nto Kabul. This would have saved the political consistency of the\r\nGovernment without exposing the Indian Empire to the tremendous strain\r\nand peril of a second Afghan expedition. There was absolutely nothing to\r\nbe gained, either in India or England, by immediately forcing an English\r\nEnvoy on the luckless Yakoub; while it enormously enhanced the\r\ndifficulties with which he had to cope. Nevertheless, in the face of\r\nhistoric precedents, in defiance of multiplied warnings, Lord Lytton\r\ndeliberately resolved to reproduce, for the edification of Asia, the\r\ntragedy of Shah Soojah and Sir William Nacnaghten, the only difference\r\nbeing that on this occasion the principal parts were played by Yakoub\r\nKhan and Major Cavagnari. The fact is that from first to last in this\r\nbad business the chief agents were moving in a world of their own\r\nimagining. They appear to have persuaded themselves that they had but to\r\nrefuse to _see_ facts, and the facts would vanish. They had but to\r\npublish in the _Times_ that Lord Lytton was a \"Viceroy specially\r\ngifted,\" and forthwith he would become what he was described to be. They\r\nhad but to assert that the Afghans had no objection to the presence of a\r\nBritish Envoy at Kabul, and immediately their objections would\r\ndisappear. The mischief is done now past recall. Hardly even in 1857 was\r\nour Indian Empire in a position of greater peril than it is now. The\r\npersistent opposition between official acts and official language which\r\nhas been the distinguishing characteristic of Lord Lytton's\r\nadministration has created an universal disbelief in the sincerity of\r\nour speech and the equity of our intentions. In the circle which\r\nsurrounds the Viceroy, it seems, indeed, to have become an accepted\r\nmaxim that it is a matter of indifference whether or not the natives are\r\nheartily loyal to our rule. And Sir Alexander Arbuthnot, in his Minute\r\non the Repeal of the Cotton Duties, notes the fact as \"a grave political\r\ndanger.\" It is a maxim which could not have been formulated except by\r\nthe agents of a Government who felt that they had forfeited, past hope\r\nof recovery, the confidence of those they were set to rule over. Of the\r\nalienation itself there can be no question. The loyalty of the native\r\nhas, probably, never been at a lower ebb since 1857. And any reverse in\r\nAfghanistan might kindle a flame that would spread from one end of India\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\nBut there is nothing to be gained by anticipating greater difficulties\r\nthan already beset us. I will assume that no additional complications\r\noccur--that General Roberts has succeeded without much difficulty in the\r\noccupation of Kabul--that General Stewart has possession of Kandahar,\r\nand that all we have to determine is what to do with Afghanistan now we\r\nhave got it. There are but three courses of conduct possible--withdrawal\r\nfrom the country altogether, a return to the arrangements formulated in\r\nthe Treaty of Gundamuck, or annexation. I will consider the last first.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnexation.\r\n\r\nNobody, so far as I know, desires to annex Afghanistan. But there are, I\r\napprehend, but few who are aware of what is involved in \"the annexation\r\nof Afghanistan,\" and the danger is that we may drift almost unwillingly\r\ninto annexation, to discover the full consequences only when too late.\r\nEverybody is agreed that India cannot defray the costs. This is set down\r\nby the supporters of Government at a sum of five millions annually. I\r\nbelieve it would be much larger; but we will assume that five millions\r\nis a correct estimate. By no possibility could we screw this additional\r\nsum from the people of India. Already the expenses of the administration\r\nincrease at a far quicker rate than the revenues which have to meet\r\nthem. The costs of governing Afghanistan, therefore, would have to be\r\ndefrayed from the English Exchequer. But assuming this to be arranged,\r\nthe pecuniary difficulty is the smallest which has to be encountered. To\r\ngarrison the interior and frontier of Afghanistan we should require not\r\nless than forty thousand men--one-half of whom would have to be English\r\nsoldiers. For, until the interior of Afghanistan is completely opened\r\nout by roads which can be traversed throughout the year, the garrisons\r\nholding the country would have to be sufficiently strong to be\r\nindependent of reserves and supports during the winter. And if we\r\nattempted to hold Balkh and Herat, twenty thousand English soldiers\r\nwould not suffice. Now where are these English soldiers to come from? An\r\naddition of at least forty thousand men to our regular army would be\r\nrequired in order to supply them. But the English part of our\r\nAfghanistan garrison does not present so insuperable a difficulty as the\r\nnative. It would not be safe, at least for many years, to organize our\r\nnative garrison from the Afghans themselves. The regiments would have to\r\nbe recruited in India specially for this service--but out of what races?\r\nThe natives of the Southern parts of India have not the physique capable\r\nof enduring the severities of an Afghanistan winter. The Sikhs or\r\nHindoos of Upper India would certainly not enlist in a service which\r\ncarried them so far from their homes into the midst of an alien people\r\nand an alien faith. The only recruits we should obtain in large numbers\r\nwould be Muhammadans. The danger, then, is obvious. In India the fierce\r\nfanaticism of the Moslem creed is mitigated by its contact with the\r\nmilder tenets of Hindooism; but remove an Indian Moslem to Afghanistan,\r\nand he would very soon become inspired by the religious zeal of his\r\nco-religionists around him. We should be exposed to the risk,\r\nperpetually, of our native garrison combining with the people of the\r\ncountry to expel the infidel intruders from the land, and restore the\r\nsupremacy of the Prophet. But even these dangers dwindle into\r\ninsignificance when we contemplate the main result of an annexation of\r\nAfghanistan. That result would be that the hills and deserts of\r\nAfghanistan would no longer extend between the Russian Power and our\r\nown. We should have given to Russia the power to interfere directly in\r\nthe internal concerns of India.\r\n\r\nI have never supposed Russia to have any sinister designs upon India.\r\nAfter much reading I have failed to discover any proof of such designs.\r\nThose who suspect Russia obtain their evidence by a very simple process.\r\nThey reject as incredible the objects assigned by the Russian Government\r\nas guiding its policy, and substitute their own fixed preconception in\r\nplace of them. I believe that neither Russia nor any other Power would\r\naccept of India as a free gift. I cannot imagine a rational statesman\r\ncoveting for his country so burdensome and unprofitable a\r\nresponsibility. But that a Russian Government should ever attempt the\r\ninvasion and conquest of India is to me beyond the power of belief. What\r\nMr. Cobden wrote in 1835 appears to me as convincing at this day as it\r\nwas then.\r\n\r\n    \"China,\" he wrote, \"affords the best answer to those who argue that\r\n    Russia meditates hostile views towards our Indian possessions. China\r\n    is separated from Russia by an imaginary boundary only; and that\r\n    country is universally supposed to contain a vast deposit of riches\r\n    well worthy of the spoiler's notice. Besides, it has not enjoyed the\r\n    '_benefit_' of being civilized by English or other Christian\r\n    conquerors--an additional reason for expecting to find a wealthy\r\n    Pagan community, waiting, like unwrought mines, the labours of some\r\n    Russian Warren Hastings. Why, then, does not the Czar invade the\r\n    Chinese Empire, which is his next neighbour, and contains an\r\n    unravaged soil, rather than contemplate, as the alarmist writers and\r\n    speakers predict he does, marching three thousand miles over regions\r\n    of burning deserts and ranges of snowy mountains to Hindostan, where\r\n    he would find that Clive and Wellesley had preceded him?\"\r\n\r\nApart, however, from the question of motives, it is not possible to\r\nmarch an army from Herat to the Indus. And we must always bear in mind\r\nthat even if the Russian army reached the Indus, their real work,\r\ninstead of being over, would only then commence. With that vast extent\r\nof hill and desert behind them they would have before them some sixty\r\nthousand British troops in an entrenched position. Even a victory would\r\nleave the invader begirt about with dangers and difficulty; a defeat\r\nwould be his utter annihilation. Not a soldier of the army of invasion\r\nwould return to tell the tale. It is impossible to divine where or how\r\nRussia could raise the money for so gigantic an enterprise; and if the\r\nmoney was forthcoming it is not credible that any Government should\r\nfling it away on such a hopeless undertaking. In assuming that Russia\r\nwill refrain from an attack upon India, there is no need to credit\r\neither the Government or the people with more than that ordinary common\r\nsense which hinders men and nations from attempting to achieve the\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe danger to India arises not from the existence of any Russian designs\r\nagainst our Empire, but from the belief that such exist. This belief\r\nwill, so to speak, hybernate for a season; then all at once we find it\r\nin full activity, and creating a panic in every heart of which it takes\r\npossession. These are the critical moments for the well-being and\r\nsecurity of our Indian Empire. In such a period of panic we rushed into\r\nthe disastrous war in Afghanistan in 1838. Under the influence of like\r\nfeelings we involved ourselves in the inglorious raid the first act of\r\nwhich has just terminated. On both occasions we have been guilty of\r\nassailing a Prince whose only desire was to form an intimate alliance\r\nwith us. On both occasions we have carried fire and sword among a people\r\nwith whom we frankly avowed that we had no assignable cause of quarrel.\r\nBut so long as Afghanistan extended between us and the Russian dominions\r\nin Asia it was physically impossible to declare war against Russia. In\r\nour unreasoning panic we fell upon the Ameer and his people, because\r\nthere was no one else to attack. But if we make the Hindoo Khosh our\r\nmilitary frontier, then Russia, by assembling a few thousand men upon\r\nthe Oxus, can, whenever she pleases, agitate India from one end to the\r\nother. She will not need to attack. The menace will be sufficient. For\r\nwe must remember that the undisputed supremacy of British rule in India\r\ndepends, in the main, upon two conditions, both of which are destroyed\r\nif we annex Afghanistan. The one is, that no heavier burden be laid upon\r\nthe people than they are willing to bear; and the other, the absence of\r\nany hope of deliverance. The cost of maintaining our supremacy in\r\nAfghanistan _will_ make the burden of our rule utterly intolerable alike\r\nto our native soldiers and our civil population; the assembling of a\r\nRussian army on the frontiers of Afghanistan will provide the hope of\r\ndeliverance. The hazards and uncertainties of the situation would keep\r\nthe natives in a state of perpetual unrest. The ambitious and the\r\ndisaffected would engage in intrigue and conspiracy; trade would\r\nlanguish; the internal development of the country be abruptly arrested;\r\nand the Empire would assuredly be wrested from our hands on the occasion\r\nof the first European war in which we became involved.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Gundamuck.\r\n\r\nAnnexation being impossible, is it wise, or is it practicable, to return\r\nto the provisions of the Treaty of Gundamuck? It is neither wise nor\r\npossible, for the simple reason that this Treaty was based upon a\r\nfiction. It was grounded upon the utterly false assumption that there\r\nexisted in Afghanistan a central authority, acknowledged as legitimate\r\nby all the people of Afghanistan, with whom we could establish permanent\r\ndiplomatic relations. There is no such authority. Instances have been\r\nadduced of attacks made upon European Embassies in other Oriental\r\ncountries, and the argument has been put forward, that as,\r\nnotwithstanding such outbreaks, diplomatic relations have been\r\nmaintained with Turkey and Persia, there is no reason to conclude from\r\nthe fate of Major Cavagnari that they are impossible in Afghanistan. The\r\ncases are not parallel. The Ameer of Kabul has no such authority in his\r\ncapital or throughout his dominions as the Sultan or the Shah. It is\r\npossible, though not very probable, that a British Envoy might reside in\r\nKabul without being murdered, but the measure of his utility would\r\ndepend upon the fluctuating fortunes of the Ameer to whom he was\r\naccredited. The only way to obviate this would be to place a force at\r\nthe disposal of the Envoy, sufficient to put down all insurrectionary\r\nmovements against the Ameer. But if we undertook this duty, we should\r\nbecome responsible for the character of the civil administration. We\r\ncould not punish the victims of a cruel or rapacious Ameer, without at\r\nthe same time cutting off at their source the cruelty and rapacity, by\r\nthe deposition of an unworthy ruler. And thus, in a very brief time, we\r\nshould find that virtually we had annexed the country. Facts are\r\nstubborn things, and it is worse than useless to fight against them.\r\nThose who contend that the murder of Major Cavagnari ought not to be\r\nallowed to overturn what they term the \"settled policy\" of the Ministry,\r\nare bound to show in what way this \"settled policy\" can be carried out.\r\nHow do they propose to obtain an Ameer towards whom all the sections of\r\nthe Afghans shall practise a loyal obedience? And if no such Ameer can\r\nbe obtained, with whom or with what are we to establish diplomatic\r\nrelations?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Policy of Withdrawal.\r\n\r\nThere remains the policy of withdrawal. The surest barrier against\r\nforeign aggression in India is to be obtained in the contentment and\r\nprosperity of the people. A people thus situated are prompt to repel\r\ninvasion, and secret intrigue is deprived of the conditions essential to\r\nits success. But in order that the people of India should be prosperous\r\nand contented, it is absolutely necessary that the financial burdens\r\nthey have to carry--and especially the military charges--should not be\r\nenhanced. It is not possible to advance our military frontier--even to\r\nthe extent of the (so-called) \"Scientific Frontier\"--without an enormous\r\nenhancement of our military expenditure. And all military expenditure is\r\nunprofitable, in the sense that it takes so much from the tax-payer and\r\nbrings him no material equivalent. Consequently, whatever else this\r\nforward policy accomplishes, it cannot fail to impoverish the people and\r\nstimulate their discontent. Moreover, the incidents of the war have\r\ndemonstrated that an invasion of India from Central Asia is physically\r\nimpossible. We started from the Indus, firmly resolved to march to\r\nHerat, if necessary; but when we had reached Kandahar, we found it\r\nimpossible to advance further. It would be equally impossible for a\r\nRussian army to march from Herat to the Indus. There is, therefore, no\r\nsuch reason for a change of frontier as was alleged in justification of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nIn all probability there is not even a Tory in England who does not in\r\nhis heart approve of a policy of withdrawal; but there are, he would\r\nsay, difficulties in the way. There are. After all the glowing eulogies\r\nthey have pronounced upon themselves, it will not be pleasant or easy\r\nfor Ministers to transfer these eulogies to their opponents. It will be\r\nextremely disagreeable for a \"specially gifted Viceroy\" to have to\r\nconfess that his chiefest gift was a gigantic capacity for blundering.\r\nBut if India is to be preserved to the nation, there is no escape from\r\nthis unpleasant alternative. Either Ministers must acknowledge an error\r\nthat is now patent to all the world, or India must be saddled with the\r\nheavy costs and the incalculable risks of an annexation of Afghanistan.\r\nThese risks, it must be remembered, are not transitory, but enduring;\r\nand if we accept them, we must be prepared for a doom of absolute\r\neffacement in the politics of Europe. The argument which will be urged\r\nagainst withdrawing from Afghanistan is, of course, the old familiar\r\none--the loss of prestige. This is an argument impossible to refute\r\nbecause the exact worth of prestige is an unknown quantity, as to which\r\nno two people are agreed. But whatever be its value, to rush upon ruin\r\nand destruction in order to preserve our prestige is an act of insanity.\r\nIt is as if a man should commit suicide in order to preserve his\r\nreputation for courage. When we retired from Afghanistan in 1842, we\r\nfrankly confessed the mistake we had committed, and I am not aware that\r\nany evil resulted from the confession. The wrongs that we had done left\r\nbehind them a legacy of evil, but not the confession of those wrongs.\r\nAnd so it is now. The frontier policy of Lord Lytton has ruined our\r\nreputation for justice, truthfulness, and generosity, and the stain of\r\nthat policy must cling to us for ever. We shall not conceal or efface it\r\nby laying a crushing burden upon our native subjects and upon future\r\ngenerations of Englishmen, in order to evade the humiliation of a\r\nconfession. On the contrary, we make what reparation is still in our\r\npower when, in the interests of both, we refuse to annex Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n    ROBERT D.

(Ouvrage couronné\r\n    par l'Institut de France.) Paris, 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some years past there has been observable in France, outside of and\r\nin opposition to Positivism, a growing movement in favour of idealism in\r\ngeneral, and of the critical idealism of Kant in particular. This\r\nphilosophy, which had previously found very few adherents in our\r\ncountry, has now begun to make its way into our teaching and our\r\nUniversities. Berkeley and Kant have been the subjects of special works,\r\nand an attempt has been made to translate and reproduce their ideas by\r\nharmonizing them with the principal doctrines of spiritualism. We have\r\nhere a movement full of promise and well deserving of attention.[1]\r\nAmong the different productions affording some notion of this\r\nphilosophical tendency, we make choice--as being both the most recent\r\nand the most complete--of a remarkable work, distinguished and crowned\r\nby the French Institute, _Positive Science and Metaphysic_, by a young\r\nand learned professor of Bordeaux, M. Louis Liard.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, M. Liard's work is well composed, its plan being simple,\r\nsevere, and lucid. It divides itself into three parts. The first is\r\ndevoted to determining the nature and limits of positive sciences--that\r\nis, of the sciences properly so called--and to showing that they cannot\r\npretend to abolish or replace metaphysics. In this portion of his book\r\nthe author discusses the three forms of the experimental philosophy of\r\nour day, namely--Positivism, the philosophy of association, and that of\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nIn the second part, the author examines what he calls Criticism--that is\r\nto say, the philosophy of Kant. The preceding discussion having\r\ndemonstrated that the human mind is incapable of departing from certain\r\nforms, certain laws, without which experience itself would be\r\nimpossible,--the author now resolves these into five fundamentals:\r\nspace, time, substance, cause, the Absolute. But are these forms or laws\r\nof the mind the laws of things as well? Have they an objective\r\nauthority? We know that metaphysics hang upon the solution of this\r\nquestion. We know, too, what is the solution given by Kant to this great\r\nproblem. In recognizing the necessary existence of these forms as laws\r\nof the mind he disputes their external reality; hence he only admits\r\ncritical, not real and dogmatic metaphysic. Now, as regards this point\r\nthe author of the book under our notice, instead of dissenting from\r\nCriticism as he had done from Positivism, appears on the contrary to\r\naccept it by its own name, and to admire and endorse its conclusions. He\r\nseems to grant or even to affirm that if Positivism is wrong, Criticism\r\nis right, and that, strictly speaking, metaphysic is not a science.\r\n\r\nAnd yet if metaphysic were not a science in the strict sense of the\r\nword--that is to say, in the sense of objective sciences--would it\r\nfollow that it was nothing, or nothing more than criticism itself? By no\r\nmeans: our author does not stop at that apparent solution; metaphysic\r\naccording to him has an object that criticism has not reached, has not\r\nshaken; metaphysic has its own proper function, in which criticism can\r\nnever take its place. Only instead of founding it on the object, we must\r\nfound it on the subject. The mind must turn away from the external world\r\nand re-enter itself. It is there that, without need of forms or\r\ncategories of which criticism has demonstrated the fallacy, the subject\r\ngrasps itself not only in its phenomena but in its being, and determines\r\nitself in conformity to an end. This end is goodness: and this is the\r\nonly notion we can form to ourselves of the Absolute. Thus, metaphysic\r\nis not the science of the object, but that of the subject; or if the\r\nname of science be still withheld, it is at least the study of the\r\nsubject, and it is founded on and completed by morality. Thus, the\r\nauthor ends by an evolution very similar to that of Kant, but with\r\ncertain differences which it will be our part to point out.\r\n\r\nThese constitute the three parts of the work. We will now take them up\r\nin succession.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nLet us first of all consider the characteristics of positive science. It\r\nhas for its object the conversion of facts into laws, or in other words\r\nthe resolving the composite into the simple, the particular into the\r\nuniversal, the contingent into the necessary. But let us observe with\r\nour author that we are only dealing here with a relative simplicity, a\r\npartial universality, a conditional necessity. None of these characters\r\npresent themselves in a really absolute manner. The simple is invariably\r\ncomposed of several terms; the universal only applies itself to a\r\ncertain class of phenomena; the necessary is so only with relation to\r\nthe consequences of a law, but the law itself always remains contingent.\r\nThus, no positive science can ever attain to the absolute. It is the\r\nsame with methods. These methods are induction and deduction. Now,\r\nhowever precise these processes be, however marvellous the sequence and\r\ninterdependence of the propositions they discover and demonstrate, their\r\ndata are never more than particular and contingent facts; consequences,\r\nthen, can only be proportioned to those data. Hence it is certain that\r\nthe positive sciences cannot go beyond a relative universality or\r\nnecessity. It may seem as though we ought to make an exception in favour\r\nof mathematics. But by a subtle discussion which it would be difficult\r\nto give summarily, the author shows that they too come under the same\r\nlaw, whence it follows that the domain of positive science properly\r\nso-called is contained within the relative.\r\n\r\nFrom this consideration there has sprung up in our day a philosophy that\r\nreduces all sciences without exception to the knowledge of relation, and\r\nby so doing has declared all metaphysics impossible: and this philosophy\r\nis called Positivism. \"Any proposition,\" says Auguste Comte, \"which is\r\nnot finally reducible to the simple enunciation of a particular or\r\ngeneral fact, is incapable of holding a real or intelligible meaning.\"\r\n\"There is nothing absolute,\" says the same philosopher, \"if it be not\r\nthis very proposition that there is nothing absolute.\" As to the proof\r\nof this proposition, it lies, according to the school in question, in\r\nthe celebrated law which reduces all progress of the human mind in all\r\norders of research to three phases: the theological phase, in which\r\nfacts are explained by causes and supernatural agents; the metaphysical,\r\nin which they are explained by abstract and ontological entities; and,\r\nfinally, the positive, in which phenomena are verified by experience and\r\nreferred to their laws--that is to say, to constant and always\r\nverifiable relations of coincidence and succession.\r\n\r\nOur author, having expounded this doctrine with much precision, proceeds\r\nto criticize it with equal sagacity. He points out what is illusory in\r\nthis law of the three states; shows that it confuses metaphysic with\r\nscholasticism; and proves, finally, that, in aiming at merging mind in\r\nknowledge, and subordinating, as he says, the subjective to the\r\nobjective, Positivism does not understand what it is speaking of, since\r\nall knowledge is ultimately referable to facts of consciousness--that is\r\nto say, to something subjective, which is in effect, as Descartes has\r\npointed out, the only order of absolutely certain truths. Besides which,\r\nlet positive science, or rather the positive philosophy, in the name of\r\npositive facts, proscribe metaphysic as it will, is it not evident that\r\nthe fundamental conceptions of all science--number, atom, force, matter,\r\ncause, law--are metaphysical conceptions? Is it not evident that all\r\nscience whatever is impossible without a certain number of principles or\r\nnotions,--in a word, of intellectual laws, which even govern experience\r\nitself? As yet the positive school has not answered the learned\r\ndemonstration of Kant on the necessity of the _à priori_ principle, or\r\nrather it has ignored it. It has made no addition to that old\r\nempiricism which the school of Leibnitz and of Kant had refuted.\r\n\r\nBut since the Positivism of Auguste Comte, too little versed in\r\nmetaphysical knowledge to discuss it authoritatively, there have arisen\r\ntwo important schools, the one of association, the other of evolution.\r\nThe former has endeavoured to base experience on an experimental and\r\npositive law; the latter has generalized this law, and made of it a\r\nparticular case of a more general law embracing the whole of\r\nNature--namely, the law of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of association may be referred to the fundamental law that\r\nall ideas rising simultaneously or successively in the human mind, tend\r\ninvariably to recall each other in the same order; this is what is\r\ncalled association of ideas. When any two ideas have thus been\r\nconstantly associated without ever being separated (as, for instance,\r\nform and colour), they unite indissolubly and thus become necessary\r\nlaws. Now, of all these necessary connections, the most universal is\r\nthis: no phenomenon ever appears without having been preceded by some\r\nother phenomenon, which is always the same under the same circumstances.\r\nThis law is that of causality, which is both the supreme principle and,\r\nat the same time, the result of all experience. To this doctrine of J.\r\nS. Mill and Alexander Bain our author opposes the two following\r\nobjections:--1st, How does it explain the generalization? 2nd, How does\r\nit explain the necessity of the laws of the understanding? On the first\r\npoint the English School appeals to a law that it calls the law of\r\n_similarity_ or faculty of identifying the like in the different. But\r\nthis is indeed, strictly speaking, a fact of association? Should not\r\nassociation, properly understood, be reduced to the law of\r\ncontiguity--that is to say, to the fact of our ideas only becoming\r\nassociated through relations of time? To admit the faculty of\r\nrecognizing similarity in diversity, what is this but to admit mind,\r\nintelligence--something, in short, which is other than a simple external\r\nassociation? As to the second point, can we reduce the rational\r\nnecessity that Kant and Leibnitz have laid down as the criterion of _à\r\npriori_ principles to a pure necessity of habit--that is to say, to the\r\nautomatic expectation of the future inscribed on the past? Where is the\r\nscientific guarantee in this hypothesis? Why should Nature bend to our\r\nhabits? \"Who can assure us that we do not dream in thinking of the\r\nfuture, and that the next sensation may not interrupt our dream by an\r\nunforeseen shock?\" We see how far-reaching this doubt is; it affects not\r\nonly metaphysic but science as well.\r\n\r\nAs to the philosophy of evolution, we know that, with regard to the\r\norigin of the principles of thought, it consists in linking the\r\nexperience of present generations to that of generations past; in\r\nsubstituting secular for individual experience--in a word, in filling up\r\nby the accumulation of ages on ages the interval existing between\r\nparticular and contingent facts and the universality of principles. This\r\nhypothesis is always at bottom no other than that of the _tabula rasa_,\r\nonly it is no longer the individual who is this _tabula rasa_, since\r\neach one has, by heredity, received a pre-formed intelligence.\r\nNevertheless, under pain of contradicting the hypothesis, we are forced\r\nto admit that there was a first subject who, prior to the action of the\r\nobject, must have been this _tabula rasa_. But here the objections of\r\nLeibnitz reappear. What can a pure, abstract, and unmodified subject be?\r\nAnd again, before any meeting of subject with object, we have to admit a\r\npure object having nothing subjective, just as the subject had nothing\r\nobjective. What shall we affirm of this pure object? Let us divest it if\r\nyou will of colour, heat, sound; must we not at least conceive it as\r\nextended, as existing in time, conceive it, that is, according to the\r\nnecessary forms that are supposed to be suppressed? For to say that it\r\nhas been capable of existing without having anything in common with\r\nthese forms, and that out of this unknown and nameless condition have\r\narisen, by way of transformation, the notions of which we treat, were to\r\nadmit that something _can_ come out of nothing. We must therefore\r\nacknowledge that universal notions do at least exist as germs at the\r\norigin of evolution. It is not evolution that has created them,\r\nevolution has only developed them, and be they ever so attenuated, they\r\nstill remain conditions without which nothing can be thought.\r\n\r\nSuch is the gist of the first part of M. Liard's book, and we have\r\nnothing to add to it but our approbation. We can but admire the skilful\r\nanalysis with which it begins, and the vigorous discussion accompanying\r\nthat analysis. The three stages traversed by the experimental philosophy\r\nof our days--namely, Positivism, the Associative Philosophy, and that of\r\nEvolution--are competently and precisely summed up. The discussion is\r\ncogent, solid, and could not be further developed without injury to the\r\nunity of the work. No doubt it requires close attention to follow it;\r\nbut it is lucid and well sustained. Whatever the difficulty metaphysic\r\nmay encounter in constituting itself a science, and getting recognized\r\nas such, it has been established that empiricism is not a tenable\r\nposition, since it has been found necessary to pass from positivism to\r\nassociation, from association to evolution; while evolution itself still\r\nsupposed some pre-formation. One thing is certain, intelligence\r\ninvariably contains a something that does not come from without--namely,\r\nintelligence itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe criticism of Positivism has taught us that there is no knowledge\r\npossible without _à priori_ elements--that is to say, without laws\r\ninherent in thought, which impose themselves upon phenomena, so as to\r\nconstitute veritable knowledge. This is the system of Kant, and thus\r\nthat system avoids not only empiricism, but scepticism as well, though\r\ncommonly confounded with it. For without necessary laws phenomena only\r\nform an arbitrary succession, entirely dependent upon the organization\r\nof the individual; we have no longer anything but individual\r\nsensations. In the Kantian philosophy, however, the individual is\r\nsubjected to laws that are superior to himself; these are the laws of\r\nhuman thought, and even, perhaps, of all thought whatever. These laws\r\nimpose themselves on each one of us in a necessary and universal manner,\r\nand by so doing communicate to phenomena an objective reality in this\r\nsense at least, that they are for individuals veritable objects; and\r\nthus it is that mathematical truths are objects to the intellect, even\r\nsupposing they should be nowhere realized in any existence independent\r\nof thought.\r\n\r\nBut are these laws of thought anything else than laws of thought? Do\r\nthey really attain to objective reality--to _things in themselves_. Kant\r\nhas denied that they do, and our author, in following in his steps,\r\nagrees, or seems to agree, with the \"Kritik\" of Kant.\r\n\r\nLet us then resolve the fundamental laws of the human intellect into\r\nfive principal concepts: these are, space and time, forms of\r\nsensibility, substance and cause, laws of external experience, and,\r\nlastly, the Absolute, the final and supreme condition of all knowledge.\r\nNow, according to Kant and our author, these notions, at least the four\r\nfirst, are at the same time necessary as subjective conditions of\r\nthought, and contradictory so soon as we seek to realize them outside of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nFor example, that space and time are found by implication in every\r\ninternal or external representation, that they are not the result of\r\nabstraction and generalization, this has been firmly established by\r\nKant; for the elements from which some have sought to derive them\r\nalready imply them. But, at the same time, they are only internal\r\nconditions, of which the objects are unrealizable outside of ourselves,\r\nand the reason of this is given by M. Liard, as follows:--Space and time\r\nhave three essential characteristics, they are homogeneous, continuous,\r\nand unlimited. Now, if we seek to make of space and time _things in\r\nthemselves_ we may doubtless conceive them as homogeneous and\r\ncontinuous, but not as unlimited, for no actual magnitude is unlimited;\r\nall magnitude is expressed in numbers, and numbers are necessarily\r\nfinite, an infinite number involving a contradiction.\r\n\r\nWe will not enter into a question here mooted by the author, leading to\r\nwhat Leibnitz calls the labyrinth of the continued (_Labyrinthus\r\ncontinui_), or of invisibles; we will content ourselves with pointing\r\nout that the reason here given is not by any means in conformity with\r\nthe ideas of Kant--indeed, that it contradicts them. In fact, our author\r\nhere applies to the two forms of sensibility the objection that Kant\r\nraised only about real things and the sensible world. The world, indeed,\r\nbeing composed of parts, can only be conceived as infinite by adding\r\nthese parts to each other, and by thus supposing the actual reality of\r\nan infinite number. But it is not so with space, which, not being\r\ncomposed of parts, is consequently not representable by numbers. \"There\r\nis only one single space, there is only one single time,\" says Kant. The\r\nnotion of space is therefore not formed by the infinite addition of\r\nsmall portions of space and time. These are unities, not numbers. Hence\r\nillimitableness is given with the very intuition. \"Space,\" says Kant,\r\n\"is represented as a given infinite magnitude,\" _als eine gegebene\r\nunendliche Quantität_. Now, so soon as the infinite is _given_, instead\r\nof _being made_ by a mental addition, it seems to us that the above\r\ndifficulty vanishes.\r\n\r\nLet us pass to the notion of substance and to that of cause. These two\r\nnotions are necessary to render possible the connection of phenomena in\r\nthe human mind. Our perceptions are, in fact, diverse; if they were only\r\ndiverse, and had no unity, there would be no passage from one phenomenon\r\nto another; consciousness would arise and disappear with each\r\nphenomenon, to arise and die anew with the next, and so on. But then\r\nthere would be no thought, for in order that thought should exist there\r\nmust be at least two different things presented to the unity of\r\nconsciousness. In other terms, we should be incapable of perceiving a\r\nchanging thing without something that was changeless. Hence this is a\r\nnecessary condition of knowledge. Now, let us see whether this condition\r\ncan be rendered objective. According to our author it cannot, for if we\r\nsubtract from surrounding things all the phenomena that fall under the\r\ndomain of the senses, what remains? Nothing. Common-sense, indeed,\r\nbelieves in substance, but does not mean thereby an abstract and\r\nmetaphysical entity, it means the whole of what strikes the senses; when\r\nthe phenomenon is opposed to substance nothing is meant but that a new\r\nphenomenon has just added itself to preceding ones. Wood burns; here\r\nwood is the substance, combustion the phenomenon. This is how\r\ncommon-sense understands the matter; but if we separate from the idea of\r\nwood all that characterizes it as wood, nothing remains but a pure\r\nabstraction, of which common-sense takes no account, and has never so\r\nmuch as thought. Our author further combats the idea of substance by\r\nappealing to the metaphysical difficulties that it suggests. Is there\r\nonly one substance, or are there several? Either hypothesis is equally\r\ndifficult to sustain. In other words, substance is nothing more than\r\nthat law in virtue of which the mind connects phenomena in one and the\r\nsame act of thought.\r\n\r\nHere, again, we are obliged to say that the preceding arguments against\r\nthe objectivity of the notion of substance are, in our opinion, far from\r\nconclusive. In the first place, it seems to us a false philosophical\r\nmethod to exclude an object from the human mind because it suggests\r\ndifficulties that we are incapable of solving. Every object must be\r\npresented to us as existing before we can judge of the possibility of\r\nthat object. Perhaps we do not possess the means of solving all the\r\nquestions which the existence of an object may suggest, but this is no\r\nreason why it should not exist. The existence of things cannot be\r\nsubordinated to the limits of our understanding; it is this very\r\nprinciple which seems to us soundest of all in the \"Kritik\" of Kant.\r\nEven should we be for ever incapable of knowing whether there is one\r\nsubstance or whether there are many, even should we be for ever doomed\r\nto doubt as to this point, it would not follow that the existence of one\r\nor of many substances were thereby done away with. Moreover, the\r\ncriticism of our author goes much further than the imperilling the\r\nobjectivity of substance; it really bears against the very notion\r\nitself. If, in fact, every phenomenon being withdrawn, nothing remains\r\nany longer in my mind, it is not merely objective substance that\r\nvanishes, it is the notion itself. What, indeed, is a notion which,\r\nanalyzed, comes to naught? And what is this necessary law which is a\r\nnonentity? Our author tells us that if we remove all the accidents there\r\nremains \"nothing perceptible to the senses.\" This is mere tautology, for\r\nit is too evident that nothing sensible ought to remain in the notion,\r\nall sensible accidents having been withdrawn; but what does remain is\r\nthat without which phenomena could not be connected. And this is no\r\nempty concept, for how should an empty concept have any uniting power?\r\nAnd, lastly, when the author, correcting himself, as we think, says that\r\nthe notion of substance reduces itself to what he calls a \"fundamental\r\nphenomenon,\" he does nothing but change the word, and in reality reverts\r\nto what we call substance. For in what sense does anything\r\nfundamental--that is to say, that to which other phenomena ultimately\r\nreduce themselves, and which cannot be reduced to any other--still\r\npreserve the name of phenomenon? All this, therefore, is but admitting\r\nunder one name what has been denied under another.\r\n\r\nThe criticism of the notion of cause is quite similar to that of the\r\nnotion of substance. It is a notion necessary to the mind, for just as\r\nwithout substance there can be no mental connection between simultaneous\r\nphenomena, in the same way without cause there can be no connection\r\nbetween successive phenomena. Causality is the necessary law that\r\nconnects each phenomenon with its anterior conditions. Without this law\r\nthere could be no science, no induction, no experience. It cannot,\r\nconsequently, be derived from experience, since it is the very condition\r\nof it. But do we seek to render cause objective as well as substance? If\r\nso, we must understand it in a different sense. Cause is no longer\r\nmerely a phenomenon anterior to another, the antecedent of a consequent.\r\nIt is something quite different, it is force, the active power, that\r\ninitiates the movement, and of which we find the type in our own\r\nconsciousness. Hence, to render cause objective is nothing less than to\r\nspiritualize the universe, to suppose everywhere causes similar to\r\nours--it is a kind of universal Fetichism. And, further, we fall into\r\nthe same difficulties as we did with regard to substance. Is there only\r\none cause or many causes? Lastly, causation thus understood is of no use\r\nwhatever to science, for science has no need at all of metaphysical\r\nforces, that which is necessary to science, and employed by it under the\r\nname of force, being a measurable quantity which it disengages from\r\nphenomena and from experience.\r\n\r\nOn this new ground the difficulty that confronts critical idealism is\r\nthe same as that affecting the notion of substance. It lies in\r\ndefending the position against empiricism, from which are borrowed all\r\nthe arguments against the reality of the cause, while attempting,\r\nnevertheless, to preserve the notion of it. How succeed in retaining as\r\nan _à priori_ law what empiricism declares to be only an acquired habit?\r\nHow explain a law of mind imposing a determined order on external\r\nphenomena? How can the entirely subjective need of relation determine\r\nphenomena to produce themselves in the order desired by our\r\nintelligence? The thunder rolls: my mind, in virtue of an innate law,\r\ninsists on this phenomenon being connected with a certain totality of\r\nantecedent phenomena--namely, heat, the formation of clouds charged with\r\nelectricity of different kinds, the meeting of these clouds, and the\r\ncombination of the two electricities, &c. How and why have these\r\nphenomena produced themselves in order to satisfy my mind? Our author\r\nsomewhere reproaches the partisans of innate ideas with supposing ideas\r\non one side and phenomena on the other. How can he exonerate Kant's\r\nsystem from this objection? No philosopher ever insisted more than he on\r\nthe opposition between matter and form, the former being, as he says,\r\n\"given _à posteriori_,\" the latter ready prepared _à priori_ in the\r\nmind. No philosopher, not even Leibnitz, has more radically separated\r\nsensibility which is passive from the understanding whose principle is\r\nspontaneity. How do these two opposite principles happen to agree? Even\r\nwere it pointed out that our senses themselves are innate, since our\r\nsensations are but the manifestation of the specific activity of each\r\none of them--light, of the optic nerve, sound, of the acoustic--it still\r\nremains certain that our sensations are only subjective as regards their\r\ncontent and not as regards their origin; they arise in virtue of causes\r\nto us unknown. How should understanding, by aid of a purely mental law,\r\nand in order to its own satisfaction, evoke sensible phenomena from\r\nnothingness, and if it had such a power, it could only be in virtue of\r\nan active force, that is, of a veritable causality? You say that you\r\nrequire relation, without which there could be no knowledge. And why\r\nmust there be knowledge because you feel the need of it? And why should\r\nthere not be in the understanding a need of unity and relation that\r\nsensibility does not satisfy? To say that the mind at the same time that\r\nit thinks the law produces phenomena conformable to that law, is to make\r\nthe mind itself the cause in the objective and metaphysical sense of the\r\nword--is no other than that universal spiritualism that the author began\r\nby refuting. We are therefore very far from admitting his criticism of\r\nthe principles of causality. Let us go on to the notion of the absolute.\r\n\r\nM. Liard begins very properly by pointing out the confusion too often\r\nmade between the notion of the infinite and that of the absolute. He\r\nsays that the infinite can only be strictly understood in the\r\nmathematical sense, but that hence, as Leibnitz has said, the true\r\ninfinite is the absolute. He admits the existence in the mind of the\r\nnotion of the absolute in so far as it is inseparable from that of the\r\nrelative. The Scotch philosopher, Hamilton, had endeavoured to suppress\r\nthis notion, and had reproached Kant for not having completely exorcised\r\nthe phantom of the absolute,[2] and for having retained it in the\r\ncharacter of _idea_ while contesting its objective existence. It is\r\nremarkable that on this point, so decisive for metaphysics, Hamilton\r\nshould have been opposed and refuted by the more modern English\r\nphilosophers, who often pass for having pushed the critical and negative\r\nspirit further than he, when, indeed, on this point it is just the\r\ncontrary. Herbert Spencer especially is one whom it is interesting to\r\nconsult here. He maintains against Hamilton the notion of the absolute\r\nas positive, not negative, \"as the correlative notion of the relative,\r\nas the substratum of all thoughts\"--I quote verbally--\"as the most\r\nimportant element of our knowledge.\"[3] He also maintains in opposition\r\nto Hamilton that the affirmation of the absolute is \"a knowledge and not\r\na belief.\" Only according to him this object that underlies all our\r\nthoughts is absolutely indeterminable by us. We know that it _is_, not\r\n_what_ it is. It is the incomprehensible, the unknowable.\r\n\r\nM. Liard seems to us substantially to admit all these conclusions.\r\n\"Existence by others,\" he says, \"is not to be understood without\r\nself-existence.\" \"Without the spur of the notion of the absolute, how\r\ncomprehend the obstinate persistence of the human mind in transcending\r\nthe limits of the relative? Is not this a proof that the relative is not\r\nsufficient to itself?\" It is one thing to affirm the absolute, another\r\nto determine its nature. Even granting that we be powerless to speak as\r\nto the essence of the absolute, and that it can never be for us other\r\nthan the indeterminable and unknowable, \"is it nothing to be assured of\r\nthe existence of an unknowable? At all events religious beliefs might in\r\ndefault of scientific certainty find in an irremovable basis this\r\nconviction.\"\r\n\r\nWe see therefore that our author agrees with Mr. Herbert Spencer in\r\ngranting the existence of the absolute; he does not seem to reduce it,\r\nas Kant does, to a mere idea. He confines himself to saying that it\r\ncannot be determined. He shows that none of the notions that have been\r\npreviously examined can fill up the concept of the absolute. Neither\r\nspace, nor time, nor substance, nor cause, nor the totality of\r\nphenomena, can be raised to the notion of absolute. It is therefore\r\nindeterminable. Now, as the absolute is the proper object of\r\nmetaphysics, it follows that metaphysics lack an object, having nothing\r\nto say thereon. Hence it is self-condemned, and consequently metaphysics\r\nis not a science.\r\n\r\nSuch is the conclusion of the second part. The first appeared to raise\r\nus above phenomena by establishing the necessity of thought and of its\r\nfundamental law. But the second confines us within the domains of\r\nthought, and forbids us to go beyond. There is, indeed, a science of\r\nthought, but this science is criticism, not metaphysics. Have we, then,\r\nonly escaped from positivism to fall into the abyss of scepticism?\r\n\r\nBefore explaining in what manner the author has endeavoured to escape\r\nfrom this abyss, there is room for an important remark on the previous\r\ndiscussion as to the notion of the absolute. Scepticism on this point\r\nmay assume three forms. Either, first, we do not even possess the notion\r\nof it, our notion is entirely negative,--the absolute is the\r\nnon-relative, is indeed the relative with a negation: such is the view\r\nof Sir W. Hamilton. Or else, secondly, we have the notion of the\r\nabsolute, of being in itself and by itself, of the superlatively real\r\nbeing, _ens realissimum_, as Kant expresses it, but it is only a notion,\r\nwe cannot affirm the existence: this is Kant's doctrine. Or, thirdly, we\r\nhave indeed a positive notion of the absolute, and we necessarily affirm\r\nits existence, only we are unable to determine its nature: this is the\r\nconclusion arrived at by Herbert Spencer. Now, of these three doctrines\r\nthe two first alone, in our opinion, belong to what may be called\r\ncriticism. The third is manifestly a return to dogmatism. The more or\r\nless of determination in the notion of the absolute is only the second\r\nproblem of metaphysic; the first is the existence of that absolute. And,\r\nmoreover, the doctrine of the divine incomprehensibility has always been\r\nmaintained by the greatest metaphysicians as well as the greatest\r\ntheologians. All mystics incline to it. There may therefore be room for\r\ndebate as to the more or less approximative character of our concepts of\r\nthe absolute. That any of these are adequate, or absolutely adequate, is\r\nwhat no philosopher has ever thought himself obliged to maintain. No\r\ndoubt, to define the absolute as the unknowable, is to express the\r\ndoctrine under a very rigorous form, but one could hardly refuse to\r\nallow the absolute to be the incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nConsequently, then, if the author, as appears to be the case from the\r\npassages we have quoted, thinks with Mr. Herbert Spencer that the notion\r\nof the absolute corresponds to an existence, and if he contents himself\r\nwith maintaining its indeterminability, we may, if we like, consider\r\nthis to be a singularly attenuated metaphysic, but we are not entitled\r\nto deny that it amounts to a departure from criticism and a return to\r\nmetaphysic. If, on the other hand, criticism does at least suppose one\r\nfundamental datum,--thought, namely, and with the thought the\r\nthinking,--we are still forced to grant to Descartes, and consequently\r\nto metaphysic, the existence of the thinking subject; and hence that\r\nscience which our author declares not to be one would be found already\r\nin possession of the claim by the single fact of what he has called the\r\ncriticism of two fundamental postulates: I think, I am--I think the\r\nabsolute, the absolute is. And is this then nothing?\r\n\r\nWe are therefore of opinion that M. Liard ought to have concluded the\r\nsecond part of his work as he did the first--that is to say, that he\r\nought to have shown the insufficiency of criticism as he did that of\r\npositivism. To our mind, criticism supposes metaphysic, as positivism\r\nsupposes criticism. Metaphysic contains the reason of criticism, as\r\ncriticism does that of positivism. Instead, then, of saying that\r\nmetaphysic is not a science, we should rather call it the culminating\r\npoint of science. But in place of following this natural order, which\r\nis, indeed, only his own method, our author has preferred to prove\r\ncriticism right in the second part of his book, and metaphysic right in\r\nthe third, by a sort of _saltus_, not contained in what goes before. He\r\nhas chosen to appear nearer to Kant than he really is; has chosen to\r\ncarry on his own evolution in Kant's manner, and to rebuild on different\r\nbases what he had demolished; but we shall see that this evolution is in\r\nreality quite different from that of Kant, and that his justification of\r\ncriticism is only apparent, or at least if he defends it, this is really\r\nonly in order subsequently to undermine it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nKant's evolution, which makes dogmatism to result from scepticism, was\r\nan entirely moral evolution, substituting for speculative the authority\r\nof practical reason. The evolution we have now to deal with is of a\r\nquite different character; it consists in passing from objective to\r\nsubjective knowledge, from the object to the subject. Even if all that\r\nhas been just said on the side of criticism were true, there is at least\r\ninvariably one existence that remains untouched by it: this existence is\r\nthat of the thinking subject, and this existence is incontestable. What\r\nappears to us as a circle to the circumference are objects, in the\r\ncentre is the subject. We do not confound ourselves with our sensations,\r\nwe distinguish between them and ourselves. Can, then, this consciousness\r\nof the thinking subject be no more than the transformation of external\r\nevents? No; for all exterior events reduce themselves to one--_i.e._,\r\nmotion; and all interior events to one--_i.e._, thought. There is no\r\ntransition or transformation possible between one of these phenomena and\r\nthe other. \"We acknowledge,\" says a distinguished savant, Professor\r\nTyndall, \"that a definite thought and a molecular action of the brain\r\noccur simultaneously, but we do not possess the essential organ, nor\r\neven a rudiment of the organ we should require in order to pass by\r\nreasoning from the one to the other.\" Thus, then, the subject exists and\r\nis not reducible to the object. Shall we say that this subject is\r\nnothing more than a sum of phenomena? But what adds up these phenomena?\r\nA common bond is needed. Have we any consciousness of such a bond?\r\n\"Yes,\" replies our author, \"we call internal states of consciousness,\r\npast, present, or possible; we attribute them to ourselves, we say that\r\nthey take place within us. What does this mean if the _ego_ to which we\r\nrefer them is only their succession? How comprehend the continuity of\r\nconsciousness?\" In a word, our author admits absolutely that the _ego_\r\nhas a consciousness of its own being, as distinct from its sensations\r\nand from external objects. \"It is,\" he says, \"an activity constantly\r\nmodified, but yet always one, which dominating its states refers them\r\nto the unity of one same consciousness.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have, without possibility of mistake, the fundamental\r\ndoctrine of the spiritualistic philosophy of Descartes, Leibnitz, Maine\r\nde Biran, and Jouffroy. By laying down this principle the author\r\nbelieves himself enabled to reinstate that metaphysic which criticism\r\nhad condemned. We, for our part, have no doubt of this; but we fail to\r\nsee how the author can at the same time hold this principle and the\r\nKantian principle of idealism. The \"Kritik\" of Kant bears upon the\r\nsubject as well as the object; according to it both the one and the\r\nother are unknowable and incomprehensible noumena. The human mind is but\r\na complex compound of sensations and categories, the unity of which is\r\nreached by the same process as the unity of external objects. No doubt\r\nKant is, indeed, obliged to concede something to the _ego_, the _cogito_\r\nas he calls it; but he does not very clearly say what it is; it is not a\r\nsubstance, not a category, not a result. \"It is,\" says he, \"the vehicle\r\nof all categories.\" What can be more vague? The metaphor shows both how\r\nlittle disposed Kant was to assign its due part to the _ego_--how vague\r\nand uncertain he left it, and at the same time how he was forced to take\r\nit into account. The _ego_, the active, continuous, self-conscious\r\n_ego_, is the rock ahead to Kant's philosophy. For how dispute the\r\nconsciousness of substance and of cause, when one admits \"a continuous\r\nactivity dominating all states of consciousness and reducing them to\r\nunity?\"\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is substance, according to our author? It is, he says,\r\nsomething that does not change considered as the necessary condition of\r\nthat which changes. What is cause? Is it not the power of initiating any\r\ngiven movement? Now, this same consciousness which gives us the _ego_ as\r\na continuous activity, does it not in so doing give it us as the\r\ncondition of phenomena and as the productive cause of movement in\r\nvoluntary efforts? Consequently, to grant that the _ego_ knows itself as\r\n_ego_, and as activity, is in point of fact to restore the notions of\r\ncause and substance which had been done away with. At most all that has\r\nbeen gained from criticism is the difficulty of comprehending substance\r\nand cause without objective, that is, material form. Its results, then,\r\namount only to the incomprehensibility of matter. But the cause of\r\nmetaphysic is not to be confounded with that of matter; metaphysic is\r\nnot tied to the existence of materialism; and were it even led in\r\nself-defence to deny the very existence of matter altogether, one does\r\nnot see that such a negation need cost it much. Descartes did not\r\nhesitate to place the existence of bodies in doubt, in order to save the\r\nexistence of spirit. Malebranche did not believe that the existence of\r\nbodies could be proved except by revelation. Leibnitz did not think that\r\nbodies were more than phenomena, the reality of which was spiritual.\r\nThere is, then, no common cause between the interests of metaphysic, or\r\nof what Kant calls _dogmatism_, and the question of material\r\nobjectivity, which may be left open without compromising the\r\nfundamental basis of things. How, then, can our author appear to assign\r\nthe victory to criticism while in reality depriving it of its chief\r\nsupport by restoring to the _ego_ the immediate consciousness of itself\r\nas a being, one, active, permanent, and continuous? Kant may have played\r\nthis game, because, in effect, outside of criticism, he only admits\r\nmoral reasons for reinstating dogmatism. But although our author follows\r\nhim too on that ground, he nevertheless enters in point of fact upon an\r\nentirely different path when he invokes immediate consciousness as a\r\nguarantee of the existence and activity of the mind. These are not moral\r\nand practical, but metaphysical reasons. Metaphysic, then, independently\r\nof morality, has its own proper foundation, which, far from being\r\naffected by criticism, is the very foundation of criticism itself. This\r\nfoundation once admitted, are we entitled to declare metaphysic no\r\nscience? We hold that we are not. Doubtless, if by science be meant an\r\nabsolutely adequate knowledge of the object, such as mathematics\r\naffords, metaphysic cannot pretend to such knowledge; but we have here\r\nonly a question of degree. The perfection of a science is not the same\r\nthing as its existence. A science is what it is by reason of the\r\ndifficulties its objects present, and the imperfections of its method;\r\nbut it is science none the less if it possesses a given object and a\r\nsolid foundation. Now, such a foundation is admitted by our author when\r\nhe admits the intuition of the _ego_ by itself; and hence it is no\r\nlonger a mere question of words to refuse the name of science to the\r\nseries of deductions that may be drawn from a principle which has been\r\nadmitted valid.\r\n\r\nIf our author grants the foundation of metaphysics by adhering to the\r\nCartesian principle of the immediate knowledge of the mind by itself, he\r\nat the same time acknowledges its most elevated term by defending the\r\nexistence of an absolute perfection, a supreme type of spirituality. \"If\r\nin ourselves,\" he says, \"relatively perfect ideas realize themselves in\r\nvirtue of their relative perfection, why should not the total perfection\r\nfrom whence they are derived exist? There is nothing contradictory in\r\nsuch an absolute.\" Is not this to admit the doctrine of the perfect\r\nbeing as the Cartesian School has constantly expressed it? but is it\r\nenough _to_ say that the total perfection _may_ exist, enough to inquire\r\nwhy it should not exist? Should we not go further, and say with Bossuet,\r\n\"On the contrary, perfection is the reason of being.\" Here we are forced\r\nto allow, in the views, or at all events in the expressions of our\r\nauthor, a fluctuation and uncertainty which now impel him towards the\r\ncritical, and now towards the metaphysical position, without his\r\narriving at a sufficiently decided conclusion. \"The absolute,\" he says,\r\n\"would then be the ideal of moral perfection. But by such a definition\r\ndo we not compromise its reality?\" To which doubt he replies that the\r\n\"true reality is precisely the ideal.\" Now, this is an equivocal and\r\nobscure reply, demanding explanation. No doubt the reality claimed for\r\nthe perfect being is not a sensible and material reality. But there is\r\nanother than material reality--there is a spiritual, such as is\r\nmanifested to us in the reality of consciousness, in the immediate\r\nactivity and intuition of our being. We may, indeed, style this sort of\r\nexistence _ideal_, in opposition to material existence; but the\r\nexpression is incorrect, for that which, properly speaking, is an ideal\r\nexistence is one merely represented to the mind when thinking of\r\nsomething that no longer exists, does not yet exist, nor ever will\r\nexist. Now, the question is, whether the moral absolute, of which we\r\nhave just had the definition given, belongs to the first or to the\r\nsecond of these ideals; whether it exists for itself, or only for us, in\r\nso far as we think it, and while we think it. For a mode of existence\r\nlike this, dependent on our own thought, is very far from being the\r\nsupreme reality; it is only a modal and subjective reality. Thus our\r\nauthor, we see, expresses himself too uncertainly. Nevertheless, his own\r\nprinciples sufficiently authorized him to declare himself with more\r\nprecision. Indeed, we have seen, on the one hand, that he, with Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer, affirms the existence of the absolute; and, on the\r\nother hand, that he acknowledges the concept of total perfection to be\r\nin nowise contradictory. Granting so much, must not absolute perfection\r\nbe the reason of the existence of the absolute, as relative perfection\r\nis the reason of the existence of the relative? If, however, any choose\r\nto call that supreme perfection the _Idea_, with Hegel--as Plato calls\r\nit the _Good_, Aristotle the pure _Act_, Descartes the _Infinitely\r\nPerfect Being_--we have nothing to object, so long as it be clearly\r\nunderstood that the _idea_ shall signify the identity of the thought and\r\nthe being, and not merely a subjective conception of the human mind.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: it results from what has been already said, that spite of his\r\npowers of thought, the author has not been able to escape a certain\r\nfluctuation between criticism and spiritualism, and has only arrived at\r\na contradictory compromise between the two conceptions. From criticism\r\nhe borrows the ideality of the notions of space, time, substance, cause,\r\nand the idea of a moral absolute founded on purely moral motives. From\r\nspiritualism he borrows the existence of the absolute as the necessary\r\ncorrelative of the relative, and the consciousness of the subject which\r\nperceives itself in its continuity as the cause of its phenomena; and,\r\nfinally, the idea of a total perfection, which may, without involving\r\nany contradiction, have the reason of its existence in itself. These two\r\norders of conception are not so closely connected as they should be; too\r\nmuch is conceded to criticism, too little to metaphysic; and M. Liard\r\ninclines overmuch to give to morality the exorbitant privilege of\r\ndeciding between the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nBut is this equivalent to saying that we blame our author for his\r\nenterprise, and for the attempt he has made to reconcile criticism with\r\ndogmatism? By no means; for we are inclined to believe that this is the\r\nvery aim that all metaphysic should set before itself at the present\r\nday. How, indeed, could we possibly admit that so powerful, so lofty an\r\nintellectual effort as that initiated by Kant, which under the name of\r\ncriticism, of subjective or objective idealism, or even of positivism,\r\nhas but been the development of his primary thought; that so prodigious\r\na mental movement as this should be absolutely void of meaning, and\r\ndestined to leave no trace in science? How believe that since the days\r\nof Descartes the human intellect has gone mad? Would not this be to\r\nexpress ourselves in the same way as those who, including Descartes\r\nhimself in this condemnation, have maintained that since St. Thomas the\r\nwhole course of human thought has been only one long error? Can there be\r\nanything more contrary to the laws of the human mind than this\r\nhypothesis of absolute truth discovered once for all, leaving no room\r\nbeside it for anything but error? And besides, what more did Kant do\r\nthan, under the form of a system (a defective form, no doubt, but\r\nhitherto the only one known to philosophy)--what more, we ask, did he\r\nthan develop and render prominent what had been implicitly contained in\r\nthe teaching of all preceding metaphysicians? Had not they all assigned\r\na share in human consciousness to the subjective and relative, and very\r\noften a larger share than we are led to think, if we only regard their\r\nconclusions? Has there, for example, been since the days of Plato a\r\nsingle metaphysician who has denied the knowledge of the senses to be\r\nrelative, and has the full scope and bearing of this principle been\r\naccurately measured? Can that be denied which has been scientifically\r\ndemonstrated, which Descartes already affirmed, _i.e._, that light and\r\nsound--Nature's two great languages--are only the products of our\r\nphysical organization, and that outside of the eye that sees, and the\r\near that hears, there is nothing external to us but a series of\r\nvibrations and undulations, which are neither luminous nor sonorous?\r\nReduced to itself, without the presence of men or animals, matter is\r\nmerely darkness and silence! What sort of matter may this be, and how\r\nlittle resembling the one we know? But is not, it may be said, the\r\nreality of that matter attested at least by resistance, by impact? The\r\nreality--yes; but is the very nature of the external thing, as it is in\r\nitself, manifested thereby? What is impact, what is resistance, if not a\r\nmode of our sensations? To be assured of this, we have but to turn to\r\nall that metaphysicians teach us as to the nature of God. All agree in\r\nsaying that God has no sensations. If God be cognizant of matter, as is\r\nindubitable, it follows that He does not know it through sensations\r\nsimilar to ours. The _argumentum baculinum_ which appears so convincing\r\nto Sganarelle, would be powerless with regard to a pure spirit, still\r\nmore an infinite spirit. Now is not this as much as to say that impact\r\nis the mode of action bodies exercise on each other, and by which\r\nsentient beings are made aware of their existence, but that it is a mode\r\npurely relative to the sensibility of finite beings? Say that, we at\r\nleast admit with Descartes the reality of extension. But what is the\r\nreal size of the extended things by which we are surrounded, and which\r\naccording to the shape of our lenses we see enlarged, diminished, or\r\neven distorted in a thousand ways? Were it to please God, as Leibnitz\r\nhas said, to collect the immensity of worlds into a walnut-shell, while\r\npreserving the proportion of objects, we should never find it out; and\r\nsuch diminution might be carried on infinitely, without ever reaching\r\nany term of smallness. 'We grant it,' will be the reply--'all sensible\r\nknowledge is relative; Plato, Malebranche, Leibnitz, have sufficiently\r\ntold us this; but above the senses there is the understanding, which\r\nalone is made for truth. Our senses give us the appearance of things,\r\nour understanding makes us see them as they are in themselves.' Nothing\r\nmore true, and this is the basis of metaphysics. But the question is, to\r\nwhat point the understanding is separated and separable from\r\nsensibility, and reciprocally, to what point sensibility enters into the\r\nunderstanding. Is there anything in us which can really be called\r\nunderstanding pure? Understanding--yes; but pure--no! Man cannot think\r\nwithout images, says Aristotle; this alone demonstrates that our\r\nunderstanding is always obliged to sensibilize its most abstract\r\nconcepts. Moreover, between pure concepts and the data of sensibility\r\nthere is still a debatable and obscure region--that, namely, of space\r\nand time. And here it is that Kant has made his mark ineffaceably. It is\r\nby so doing that he renovated metaphysics. He believed, thought, that\r\nboth these domains belonged to sensibility and not to intelligence, that\r\nthey too were only modes of representation--that is to say, modes purely\r\nrelative to the nature of our mind. On this point also traditional\r\nmetaphysics came to his support, at least as regards time. For is it not\r\nsaid by all schools whatever that God is not in time, that He is an\r\neternal _Now_, that past and future are nothing to Him? Is it not this\r\nconception which is constantly appealed to as affording the solution of\r\nthe conflict between divine prescience and human liberty? Now to affirm\r\nthat God is not in time, and that He sees all portions of time in one\r\nsole and eternal present, is not this as much as to say that time is\r\nonly the mode of representation of finite beings with regard to\r\nthemselves; that, consequently, it is an image belonging to their\r\nfinitude, but not to what they are in themselves, since God, who must\r\nsee them as they are, sees them in an absolutely and radically different\r\nmanner? Let us add another difference between the human and divine\r\nintelligence, pointed out by Bossuet, when he said, \"We see things\r\nbecause they are, but they are because God sees them.\" Therefore in God\r\nintelligence is anterior to things, in us posterior. Now, though we can,\r\nthrough artistic creation, form some idea of an intelligence anterior to\r\nthings, the analogy is, after all, a coarse one, since in us creative\r\nimagination only deals with materials borrowed from without. Hence it\r\nfollows that our intelligence is but a very imperfect image of the\r\ndivine. Now, as the latter alone can be the type of veritable\r\nintelligence, we can only attribute to ourselves a relative\r\nintelligence, subordinated to the conditions of the creature. But does\r\nnot this amount precisely to saying that we only see things in a\r\nsubjective and human manner, and that, consequently, we do not know them\r\nas they are in themselves? Let us go further still; let us raise\r\nourselves to conceptions of the perfect being, the divine being. Here,\r\ntoo, all metaphysicians agree in acknowledging that we have only an\r\nentirely relative view of the Divinity. Is there one who admits that we\r\ncan, without anthropomorphism, understand literally all the attributes\r\nthat we impute to the Deity? Has not God Himself defined Himself in\r\nScripture as _Deus absconditus_, and does not the doctrine of mysteries\r\nin every great religion imply that the true essence of the Deity is\r\nunknown to us, and that, consequently, the philosophic doctrine of the\r\nattributes of God is a purely human conception, by which we strive to\r\nrepresent to ourselves the unrepresentable, and to bring within the\r\ngrasp of our sensibility and our imagination the august and sublime\r\nnotion that confounds all created substance?\r\n\r\nThis is what we are taught by all metaphysic doctrine whatever, and not\r\nonly by that of Kant, Plato, St. Augustine, St. Thomas, Descartes,\r\nMalebranche, Leibnitz, Fénelon: all alike teach us that the senses are\r\nbut a confused and relative knowledge, that space and time are modes of\r\nfinite existence, that God can only be conceived of by analogy, and not\r\nin His essence. Are such conceptions as these very different from those\r\nof Kant? And if he has taken them up again under another form, if by\r\nisolating he has exaggerated them, his is the merit of having brought\r\nthem into prominence, of reminding us of them, and forcing us to assign\r\nthem a more important place in our doctrines. Despite the warnings of\r\nthe greatest minds, and of all great minds, are we not ceaselessly\r\ntempted to yield to the automatic instinct which makes us believe things\r\nto be as we see them, makes us suppose the existence of a matter, solid,\r\ncoloured, sonorous, cold, or hot, such as the senses acquaint us with;\r\nmakes us believe in an absolute space and time, with which we no longer\r\nknow how to deal when we think of the true Absolute; makes us conceive\r\nof this true Absolute or Goodness as of a species of great man, that we\r\nstrip of a body, without even reflecting whether we have really the\r\npower of representing to ourselves anything absolutely incorporeal? It\r\nis against this vulgar current dogmatism, which philosophy has so much\r\ntrouble in getting rid of, that not only Kant, but every metaphysician,\r\nprotests. Kant only expounded, under a rigorous and systematic form, all\r\nthe critical portion of previous metaphysics. To us it seems\r\nimpossible--with more or less reservation, and without insisting at\r\npresent too rigidly on the share of the relative and subjective in human\r\nknowledge--impossible, we say, not to allow this share, and\r\nconsequently, in a certain measure, not to give in our adherence to\r\ntranscendental criticism and idealism. There is, however, as we have\r\nseen above, something which escapes from this relativity of all human\r\nknowledge: it is the very fact of knowing. This fact has in itself\r\nsomething absolute. I know not whence it comes, I cannot explain it; I\r\nmarvel that a being should be met with in whom at one time or other what\r\nwe call knowledge has appeared; but this fact cannot exist without being\r\nknown by the knower. All knowledge supposes, then, a subject that knows\r\nitself--that is to say, who is internally present to himself. Here\r\nknowledge comes from within, not from without. Whatever is objective can\r\nonly _appear_ to me, and is consequently a _phenomenon_. I only see its\r\noutside, and it is only in relation to myself that I can grasp even that\r\noutside. But the conscious _ego_ sees itself from within. Shall we say\r\nthat it appears to itself? I am willing to say so, but as it appears to\r\nitself that appearance is a reality, for the form that I give it is my\r\nown form. In order that it should become _me_, _I_ must be _me_. Every\r\nother object has to be given in the first instance before it is\r\nperceived; in order that I should see a house, a house must be there. It\r\nis not so with the _ego_. For if at the moment it is given me it is not\r\nalready me, how is it to become so? How shall I know it as such? And if\r\nit be already me, it is already perceived as such. Hence it follows that\r\nthe external thing may be represented without being, as happens in\r\nsleep, while I cannot think without thinking myself, or think myself\r\nwithout existing. All subjectivism, all relativism, all criticism,\r\ntherefore, are baffled in presence of the _ego_.\r\n\r\nIt is from this solid and immovable foundation laid by Descartes at the\r\nentrance of science that we may set out to extend the sphere of our\r\nknowledge. Everything, it is said, is relative. What matter if that\r\nrelative be connected by precise and fixed relations with the unknown,\r\nif that which is given be a strictly faithful projection of that which\r\nis thought? For instance, we do not know the souls of other men in\r\nthemselves, we have never seen a soul such as it is in itself; those\r\neven which are dearest to us are unknown like the rest. But if we\r\nsuppose all the signs by which they manifest themselves to be sincere,\r\nis it not to know them truly and in the only way intelligible to us, to\r\nhear their voices, and understand their words, and interpret their\r\nactions? No doubt nothing external to ourselves can be known internally\r\nby us; but if the exterior be the expression of the interior, is not the\r\none the equivalent of the other? And to ask more would amount to asking\r\nto be more than man. Science teaches us that all appearances have a\r\nfixed and precise relation to reality. The visible apparent sky is\r\nstrictly what it ought to be to express the real sky. The deeper our\r\nknowledge of things goes, the more we see the perfect conformity of the\r\napparent to the real, the more faithfully do phenomena translate\r\nnoumena. Are we not, therefore, justified in supposing that these\r\nrelative noumena, which are still no more than appearances, could be\r\ntranslated in their turn, if only we had the key to them, into other\r\nnoumena of which they are the form and image? I may say the same about\r\nthe anthropomorphic representations of Deity. I admit that the Absolute\r\nis in its essence above all human representations. But these\r\nrepresentations, when we disengage them as much as possible from all\r\nsensible elements, are none the less the true expression of that\r\nincomprehensible essence in so far as it appears to a human\r\nconsciousness. If not God in Himself, it is God in relation to me; and\r\nit is with only this last that we have to do so long as we are but men.\r\n\r\nWe do not, therefore, consider it impossible to assign to the critical\r\nelement its part in metaphysic without denying the objective reality of\r\nknowledge. We think that the famous old distinction between being and\r\nphenomena, the intelligible and the sensible, still endures, despite the\r\n\"Kritik\" of Kant; or rather, this very \"Kritik\" itself is, in our eyes,\r\nonly a hyperbolical but striking manner of expressing this great truth.\r\n\r\n    PAUL JANET.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] We already endeavoured to make this philosophy known at its earliest\r\nappearance, by an article that appeared in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_\r\nof the 19th October, 1873, under the title, \"A New Phase of\r\nSpiritualism.\" We are now dealing with the most recent form of this new\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n[2] Hamilton's \"Discussions: Cousin, Schelling.\"\r\n\r\n[3] Herbert Spencer's \"First Principles,\" First Part p. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE MORAL LIMITS OF BENEFICIAL COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a Professor of _Political Economy_ was first established in the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, a controversy presently arose in the academical\r\ncommon rooms concerning the just meaning of the phrase. Among elder and\r\nconservative men, the most active-minded insisted that it ought to\r\nreceive the full width of meaning attached to it by Aristotle in his\r\nTreatise on Economy, which, with him, was essentially the economy of the\r\nState--that is, in pure Greek, _political_ economy, although this\r\nepithet is not annexed to his title. By this interpretation, the science\r\nnaturally and necessarily became implicated with moral considerations,\r\nwhich never can be excluded from the statesman's view. But the actual\r\nstudents and professors of the new science--eminently Mr. Nassau Senior\r\nand Dr. Whately, shortly afterwards Archbishop of Dublin--naturally\r\nfeared that by such an interpretation political economy would become\r\nconfounded with politics; would, indeed, cease to be a science; and by\r\nso great an enlargement of its area, would fail to receive that special\r\nand definite cultivation which Adam Smith had bestowed on it, as the\r\ntheory of national wealth. Whately indeed, to avoid this inconvenient\r\nextension of the sense, proposed to call the topic, not political\r\neconomy, but _Catallactics_--that is, the science of exchanges.\r\nExcellent in many respects as the last title was, it might have seemed\r\nto exclude the whole doctrine of taxation, and still more decisively all\r\ndiscussion of Malthus's theory of population, which belongs to politics\r\nor to morals, not at all to the doctrine of exchange. In the end, the\r\neconomists ruled that their science does not at all teach what _ought_\r\nto be, but simply what _is_, what _goes on_, and _will go on_, as an\r\ninevitable result of individuals holding exchangeable right in definite\r\narticles. Thus they seemed to have driven moral considerations out of\r\ntheir science, as much as out of gardening or medicine. To call their\r\npolitical economy, on that account, _heartless_ (as so many have done)\r\nmay seem ridiculous; but this form of attack on it arose from a\r\nperception or belief that its professors were claiming for it an\r\n_imperative_ force, while disclaiming morality, and were assuming that\r\nit was a sufficient and supreme rule for political action.\r\n\r\nOf late it has been maintained on a special ground that moral\r\nconsiderations cannot wholly be excluded from political economy. Dr. W.\r\nB. Hodgson, first holder of a new chair in Edinburgh as Professor of\r\n_Mercantile_ Economy, has urged that, in so far as morality or\r\nimmorality in individuals affects wealth and the markets, we do not\r\nexhaust the discussion on exchanges while we neglect this consideration.\r\nPerhaps indeed no one, in discussing taxation, has omitted to consider\r\nwhat taxes lead to fraudulent evasion or to smuggling; but economists\r\nhitherto, with great unanimity, have resolved that, in their character\r\nof economists, they will not notice moral evils from an opium trade, or\r\nfrom sale of deadly weapons and ammunition, or from traffic in\r\nintoxicants; nor can one in general discover from their writings that\r\nthey know vice to be wasteful, or national expenditure on needless and\r\nfoolish objects undesirable. They have a right to select what topics\r\nthey will treat, and what they will not treat. They have a right to say:\r\n\"Such and such considerations belong to morals, not to _our_ political\r\neconomy.\" But, on the one hand, if they are resolved that their science\r\nshall be as unmoral as engineering or navigation, they must not claim\r\nfor it any decisive weight in State-politics; on the other hand, the\r\ntopics which they neglect need, so much the more urgently, to be treated\r\nby others, especially since we have no professors of practical morals,\r\nand (for more reasons than one) questions of the market are not thought\r\nsuitable to the pulpit.\r\n\r\nThat an exchange of one thing for another does, on the whole, _please_\r\nboth parties to the exchange, is evidently testified by the fact that\r\neach acts voluntarily; hence, the inference is too lightly made that\r\neach is _benefited_ by the transaction. Not only so, but from an\r\nincreasing magnitude of exchanges increase of wealth is inferred,\r\nwithout any reference to the nature of the things exchanged. In a rough\r\nestimate, this reasoning has, no doubt, a _primâ facie_ weight, for we\r\nmay not dictate to the tastes of others, nor assume that tastes which\r\nare not ours are therefore silly. Yet, evidently things which perish in\r\nthe using quickly cease to be wealth, and things which are not likely to\r\nbe approved continuously cannot long command the same high price. No\r\narticle could fetch a price at all if it were not intended to be\r\nenjoyed, used, or consumed; the final purchase is called expenditure,\r\nand all expenditure is liable to moral judgment, approving or censuring.\r\nWhen we censure expenditure, not merely because it is excessive, but\r\nbecause it is essentially foolish or evil, we necessarily deplore and\r\ndeprecate the traffic which feeds it--the traffic which it encourages;\r\nhence, some vicious trades are even forbidden by law. Short of this,\r\nthere is necessarily a large margin of trades which law does not, and\r\nperhaps cannot successfully, forbid, which nevertheless may be justly\r\nregretted, censured, and, as far as may be, discountenanced. Economists\r\nare not here blamed if they (disowning moral considerations) do nothing\r\nof the kind; but they must not be allowed to blind us to the fact that\r\nsome trades, not forbidden by law, are so far from promoting wealth and\r\nweal as to be gravely pernicious. To rejoice in their magnitude, to\r\nannounce it triumphantly as a proof of national prosperity, is something\r\nworse than a mistake.\r\n\r\nNo reader, it is believed, will complain that the last sentence is\r\nmysterious or obscure. Our manufacturers of cotton and woollen have of\r\nlate loudly deplored the falling off of their home trade, while the\r\nconsumption of intoxicating drink continues to increase. They believe\r\nthat if the labouring classes spent less on the brewer and distiller,\r\nthey would spend more on the clothier. The most fanatical devotee of\r\nalcohol cannot deny that too much of it is drunk, in face of the\r\nlong-continued avowal of the judges that drink is by far the greatest\r\ncause of crime--drink, short of evident and provable drunkenness.\r\nIndeed, it is not from those who are outright drunk, but from those who\r\nhave been drinking, that the worst and most numerous outrages come,\r\nwhile the foot and the eye are steady, though the brain and the passions\r\nare perverted. To boast and rejoice in the magnitude of the drink\r\ntraffic, legal as it undoubtedly is, has no moral defence. The topic is\r\nhere adduced, not in order to push that argument further, but in order\r\nto insist that the mere increase of a trade does not _in itself_ denote\r\nan increase of wealth; is not _in itself_ necessarily a thing to be\r\napplauded either by the economist or by the moralist. In each case we\r\nmust look into detail, and consider whether this or that prosperous\r\ntrade, like a huge weed in a garden, dwarfs or kills other growths,\r\nwhich, but for it, might thrive.\r\n\r\nAn avowed ardent disciple of Mr. Cobden--a gentleman in some eminence of\r\nplace and rank--has recently dissuaded taxes on wine and tobacco for the\r\nsake of revenue, _not_ on the ground which one might expect--viz., that\r\na Government ought not to base a revenue on what may chance to be public\r\nvice, _but_ on the ground that \"the grower of wine in France and of\r\ntobacco in America\" can reasonably refuse to trade with us, if \"we will\r\nnot accept payment in _the only coin_ which he has to offer--namely, in\r\nhis wine or his tobacco.\"[4] As if we were not competent to reply: \"Of\r\nwine and tobacco we quickly get more than enough. Preserve your grapes\r\nin sawdust, or make them into raisins, and you will not find our people\r\naverse to enjoy them, nor will you encounter any unreasonable duty from\r\nour Custom-houses. As to tobacco, surely the rich land which alone can\r\nraise it, can raise no end of other products which we are certain to\r\nvalue.\" This well-informed writer, in his whole argument, seems to\r\naccount wine the only food-product which we receive from France (to\r\nsilks and elegant articles he once slightly alludes); but he cannot be\r\nignorant that the solid food which France sends us in eggs, cheese,\r\nbutter, vegetables, chickens, and dry fruit is enormous; she would in\r\nordinary years send us wheat, did not America, Russia, and Australia\r\nmake it needless. To speak of wine as _the only coin_ of France is a\r\nwonderful straining of argument. But the reason for quoting it here is\r\nto illustrate how completely the School of Cobden wishes the State to\r\nignore moral considerations in trade. Yet the State deserves no\r\nreverence, if it be not moral. Laws and enactments, framed by minds\r\nreckless of morality, are apt to be, on the one side unjust and\r\noppressive, on the other eminently corrupting. A State which gains\r\nrevenue from a vicious trade, such as gambling and debauchery,\r\ndemoralizes its people so effectually as to deserve reprobation rather\r\nthan reverence. According to the ancients, the lawgiver begins to\r\ncivilize society and to earn veneration by establishing marriage and\r\nsanctifying the family. Are we to say, \"We have changed all that now;\r\nlet the Church care for morality: it is no concern of the State?\" Who\r\nfirst taught such sentiment as wise policy, it is not easy to say; but\r\nit certainly has, in practice, if not in theory, attained a deadly\r\ncurrency. It never was the doctrine of Adam Smith. It is obviously a\r\nsure road to ruin, if its development be unopposed.\r\n\r\nA legislator, of course, ought not to guide his enactments by the\r\nmorality of any one school. If, in Greek fashion, we were to set up an\r\nEpimenides, a Solon, a Lycurgus, as plenipotentiary to start us in a new\r\ncourse, there might be some little danger of one-sided and conceited\r\nmorals; yet not much, even so; for a very one-sided or very stupid man\r\nwould hardly be elected: every lawgiver wishes his new institutions to\r\nbe permanent, and is sure to have some regard to the friction which they\r\nwould encounter in working. But where the legislation must have\r\nsanction, not from one man, but from a thousand men, of whom six hundred\r\nare elected from different circles of mixed ranks, from diverse\r\nlocalities, where forms and schools of religion, based on variety of\r\nthought, prevail, it is evidently impossible that in the laws\r\ncollectively approved any moral ideas should dominate, except those\r\nwhich are common to all who are morally cultivated. To dread moral\r\nconsiderations in the debates of an English Parliament, lest the\r\nmorality prevailing in its laws become one-sided and arbitrary, pedantic\r\nand ascetic, is so baseless, so wanting in good sense, as scarcely to\r\nseem sincere. When people tell us, \"We shall be liable to have laws\r\nagainst dancing and cardplaying, or laws compelling us to go to church,\r\nif we insist that legislation ought to study for the public virtue,\"\r\nthey not only make themselves ridiculous, they even force us to suspect\r\nthat they fear lest vice be repressed in ways inconvenient to the\r\nvicious. So much is premised, lest it be imagined or pretended that in\r\npointing at moral limits to beneficial commerce any morality is desired\r\nless broad than that which all noble and well-reputed schools\r\naccept--the morals of mankind. At the same time, what is here advanced\r\nis intended to bear less immediately on law than on the general tenor of\r\npublic opinion and practical writing.\r\n\r\nMany economists write, as assuming that it is a step forward in\r\ncivilization when a barbarous people learns artificial wants. If a New\r\nZealander, instead of being satisfied with a mat for his back, which,\r\nmade by himself, will last him for years, betakes himself to an English\r\ncoat, which he must buy with a price,--which indeed less effectually\r\nshields him from wet, and sooner wears out,--he does that which is\r\nconvenient to the English trader, but to him is a very doubtful gain:\r\nperhaps rather he brings on himself colds, cough, and consumption. If a\r\nthousand Maoris did the same, the commerce might figure in a Maori\r\nbudget, and a Maori economist might point to the new trade as a step\r\nforward in national prosperity. The Zulus, as described by Englishmen\r\nwho have travelled in Zululand or lived in the midst of them in Natal,\r\nare an upright, generous, faithful, honest race; and strange to say,\r\nEnglishmen, who have such experience of them, are found to corroborate\r\nthe utterance of Cetewayo, \"A Zulu trained by a missionary is a Zulu\r\nspoiled\"--that is, when trained in our habits they lose their national\r\nvirtues. How can this be? why should it be? Apparently, because from us\r\nthey learn artificial wants. While an apron suffices a Zulu for\r\nclothing, and a very simple hut for shelter, he can in many ways afford\r\nto be hospitable and generous. A man with very few wants has all the\r\nfeelings of superfluity and wealth while surrounded by possessions so\r\nslender that we count him very poor: and when with an amount of toil\r\nwhich to his hardihood is not at all severe, he can always calculate on\r\nproviding for himself and family all that their simple habits need, he\r\nis not deterred from present generosity by studying for his own future.\r\nBut if he learn to covet and count necessary a number of articles which\r\nrequire from him threefold labour, he feels himself no longer rich, but\r\npoor; then, instead of giving small favours gratuitously, he claims to\r\nbe paid for everything; instead of being princely, he becomes mercenary\r\nand stingy. If he imitate the dress, he is liable to envy the wealth of\r\nthe Englishman, and in schemes of laying up for the future he easily\r\nbecomes avaricious, perhaps fraudulent. Such are the steps by which one\r\nmay justly calculate that some or many barbarians degenerate from the\r\nnormal goodness of their fellows. The artificial wants which they learn\r\nwhen housed with our missionaries, or imbibe from the crafty allurements\r\nof traders, are not (_primâ facie_) a benefit at all, do not conduce to\r\nindependence, to the sense of wealth, nor to the practice of virtue.\r\nThey are simply a convenience to the European trader. If a Maori or Zulu\r\nchief frown upon such trade, which judgment does he deserve--to be\r\nscolded as barbarous, or to be praised as sagacious? With them, perhaps\r\nalso with us, to account but few things necessary is a foundation for\r\nmany virtues. Our economists often reverse the picture.\r\n\r\nNo stress is here laid on the fact that the historical saints of\r\nChristendom thought it an excellence to be satisfied with a minimum of\r\nexternal appliances for the comfort of the body. So much of arbitrary\r\nopinion may be imputed reasonably to them, and so much of fancy and\r\ncredulity to their biographers, that it does not occur to the present\r\nwriter to account their practices or principles any support to his\r\nargument. But the case of Socrates, and many other Greek philosophers,\r\nis different, and much to the point. With them, high thought, cheap\r\nfeeding, and mean circumstantials frequently went together; and perhaps\r\neven those philosophers, who were somewhat mercenary and rich, would\r\nvehemently have renounced the idea that it is a good thing to acquire\r\nhabits and tastes which make necessary to us things previously needless.\r\nBut there is danger of drawing the reader's thoughts into a new channel\r\nby this allusion to Greek philosophers when an argument of national\r\neconomy is chiefly intended, not of personal virtues. As it is better\r\nfor an individual to be satisfied with supplies that are sufficient,\r\nclose at hand, and easy of attainment, than to have fastidious tastes\r\nwhich cannot be supplied without considerable effort and labour, so it\r\nis better for a nation to have a taste for its native products, so far\r\nas our lower wants are concerned. If we can get all that the health and\r\nstrength of the body needs from our own soil, and with small\r\nexpenditure, this is better for us than to be enslaved to artificial\r\ntastes, which multiply labours for mere bodily supply. To fix ideas, let\r\nme illustrate the principle here contained by discussing those popular\r\nbeverages, tea and coffee.\r\n\r\nTea undoubtedly, as superseding beer, cider, and wine, has wrought much\r\nbenefit to England, even if it have been (when heavily taxed) dearer\r\nthan our native intoxicants. When taken with little food, in strong and\r\nfrequent cups, it may often have weakened the nerves; but it does not,\r\nlike alcohol, pervert the brain and inflame the mind, thus leading to\r\nfolly, vice, and crime. The present writer is, and always has been, a\r\ntea drinker; nor have the many assaults on this beverage which have been\r\nsent to him shaken his belief that, taken in moderation, it has no evil\r\ncomparable to its good. The present argument does not aim to prove that\r\ntea is in itself bad, only that the too-exclusive addiction to it has\r\nhurtfully excluded the trial of native beverages, which are perhaps\r\nbetter, certainly cheaper, and far more accessible.\r\n\r\nRigid enemies of alcoholic drink often assure us, in poetical and\r\necstatic language, that water is the only reasonable and right drink for\r\nman, as for other animals; but the water which they recommend and\r\ndescribe as gushing and sparkling in mountain rills does not come to the\r\nhearth and home of every mountain dweller, much less is it attainable by\r\nthe inhabitants of cities or boggy plains. The hardy beasts of the\r\nfield, if they can get the water pure, manage to endure its coldness in\r\nall seasons; so perhaps might we, if we could recover robustness of the\r\nstomach without losing any advantage of a developed brain. That such\r\nrecovery is impossible is not here asserted, but simply that, under the\r\nexisting circumstances, the water (through its impurities or its\r\ncoldness) often needs to be cooked, to be warmed, to have then some\r\ntaste superadded which shall overcome mawkishness. When this is\r\nconceded, the question arises, will no native botany suffice? Are we of\r\nnecessity driven to import tea from China or Assam? Such are the\r\nwonderful and deep harmonies of Nature that in each long-inhabited\r\ncountry the constitution of animals becomes adapted to its plants as\r\nwell as to its climate, and finds among them not only its food, but its\r\nremedies for disease. Native herbs are often found more health-restoring\r\nthan pretentious foreign drugs; nor is it extravagant to imagine that\r\nnative leaves and berries might adapt themselves as well to the palate\r\nof Englishmen as tea and coffee, and better to their stomachs, if,\r\ninstead of buying from the foreigner, we had duly studied our home\r\nresources. In the case of coffee, it curiously happens that there are\r\npersons among us who prefer what is called dandelion coffee to the\r\ncoffee of Arabia; and that the preference is sincere seems proved by the\r\naccident that the dandelion thus prepared is dearer than the best Mocha.\r\nNor does this dearness weigh against our argument. Twenty years ago\r\nbrown bread was charged by bakers as fancy bread; ten years ago lentils\r\nwere double their present price; in each case because the demand was so\r\nuncertain. The price of dandelion would quickly come down if it were in\r\nlarge and daily request. As substitutes for tea many leaves may be named\r\nwhich will not be called simply medicinal, prominently those of the\r\nsweet bay, the peach, and the black currant. If we were by any cause cut\r\noff from tropical markets, some combination would soon be discovered\r\nwhich carried off public preference; and when a national taste in it had\r\nonce been established, every good purpose would have been attained\r\nwithout the foreign article. Should we not in that case moralize with\r\nwonder over the vast apparatus of great ships, which had been built, and\r\nmanned, and stored, and sent to sea, with loss of sailors' lives,\r\nentailing widowhood and orphanhood, for no better reason than to bring\r\nback leaves, for which adequate substitutes abound at home? This\r\nargument undertakes not to prove, but to illustrate. It is not specially\r\nconfined to the case of tea or coffee. It does not make positive\r\nassertion that we can now change the English taste, nor does it urge a\r\ntransition which would be violent, if at all sudden. It merely points to\r\nreasonable probabilities, as showing that a vast trade with a distant\r\ncountry to gratify an artificial want, if it prove how much we can\r\nafford to spend without being ruined, yet does not at all prove that we\r\nenrich ourselves by the exchange. At the same time, so great is the\r\nfacility for making drinks, that we might assume higher ground and press\r\nour argument farther. The deliciousness of Oriental sherbet is no matter\r\nof doubt or controversy. Its basis is simply barley-water; to flavour\r\nit, the foreigner, of course, uses some of his own fruits, but we have\r\nplenty of substitutes at hand, at least while sugar abounds to us. It\r\nmay be warmed, if necessary: so little need we depend on the Chinese.\r\nBesides, some among us are satisfied with, and warmly applaud, the drink\r\nprepared from simple oatmeal. If we all had this taste, we should\r\nnationally be richer.\r\n\r\nIt may be retorted, \"Did you not name _Sugar_? Do you advocate making\r\nsugar of beetroot?\" But no general renunciation of foreign commerce is\r\nfor a moment here suggested as expedient. While we can bring sugar made\r\nfrom cane, and save our lands for other uses than beetroot, we presume\r\nthis commerce to conduce to wealth. Not but that we may suspect the\r\ncheapness of sugar to conspire with other causes in slackening our zeal\r\nfor _Honey_. Bees do not occupy and use up arable land. An abundance of\r\ncottage gardens and little rockeries satisfy them. Their depredations do\r\nnot lessen the sweetness of flowers, nor the savour of herbs. They add\r\nto our wealth, at very small expense. They greatly add to the\r\nfertilization of plants. By all means let us get from the foreigner what\r\nwe need; only let us not therefore neglect and forget our native\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nIn other and greater matters a like topic recurs. When the controversy\r\nagainst the Corn Laws was at its height, the advocates of repeal were\r\ntaunted with wishing to explode native wheat. They replied, \"Wheat is\r\nnow largely sown in England where the climate or soil is unfavourable;\r\nin such fields only, the culture will be discouraged; where it can be\r\nproduced and ripened with greater certainty it will still be grown, and\r\nthe price will no longer be forced up; the lands less suited to wheat\r\nmay well yield, either some other grain in rotation, or other needful\r\ncrop.\" Valid as this reply seemed, grand and glorious as are the results\r\nof opening our ports to foreign corn, the retrospect of thirty years\r\nnevertheless suggests new lines of thought. Want of food in Ireland when\r\nthe potato crop failed was the argument which converted Sir Robert Peel;\r\nbut the desire of selling cotton and woollen fabrics, or hardware, to\r\nthose whose \"chief coin\" was wheat, gave an earlier impetus to the\r\nAnti-Corn Law League. Cobden and his associates were in the right, and\r\nperformed well the task of the day; but the existing state of our\r\nagriculture is now discerned to be highly unsatisfactory. Every year\r\nwidens and deepens the conviction that our laws of Land Tenure are\r\nfundamentally wrong; indeed, they are diverse from those of all the\r\nworld; if they are not signally better than those of all other nations,\r\nthey are gravely and lamentably worse; and the idea now presents itself,\r\nthat the temporary relief given to us by the free importation of wheat\r\nhas proved a buttress to an evil system of land laws, and has blinded us\r\nto the essential evils contingent on a perpetual increasing ratio of the\r\npopulation in great towns to that of the rustic districts. Much\r\nwealthier, no doubt, we are, and our poorer classes are less\r\nhard-worked. To dwell on the drawbacks through higher expectations,\r\nartificial wants, higher prices of coal, bricks, and houses--not to\r\nmention worse matters--might lead into too long digression. But, to\r\nbring out the idea here pointed at, we may speculate as to the results\r\nwhich must have followed, if no foreign markets had been able to give\r\nus permanent supplies of necessary food. Suppose that barely we had been\r\nable in 1847 to save from starvation as many poor Irishmen as we did\r\nsave, but that in succeeding years the United Kingdom had been cast on\r\nits own resources for grain and cattle; will any one maintain that by a\r\nproper use of the land we could not have fed our own population?\r\n\r\nIf any one is of that opinion, let him consider the phenomena of French\r\nagriculture. A century ago France seemed unable to feed her inhabitants.\r\nThousands of the population died of starvation, even the king's own\r\nservants. Misery among the peasants and the poorer classes in towns was\r\nuniversal. No one imagined that the country could afford to export food,\r\nor had any idea of its vast capacity of production. Her climate is not\r\nnow superior to what it was; her area is somewhat enlarged by the\r\nsagacious plantings on dunes of sand; the soil is improved by a\r\ncentury's tillage; the produce is more valuable, because the peasants\r\nhave been taught many secrets of fruit culture. Most important of all,\r\nmillions of peasants are owners of small freeholds. The \"magic of\r\nproperty\" has made them industrious, saving and ever vigilant to\r\nincrease and improve the crops. We in England censure and deplore the\r\ncompulsion on a French parent to divide his petty freehold and his gains\r\nequally among his children. If this be a grave evil, yet so much the\r\nmore remarkable are the marvellous results of the union in one man of\r\nlandlord, farmer, and labourer: for we see that by the universal and\r\nuntiring industry which this fact elicits, not only were the great\r\nextravagances of the Second Empire and its wars sustained, but, in spite\r\nof the scarcely calculable losses of the Franco-German war, the fine of\r\ntwo hundred and fifty millions sterling, which France had to pay, was\r\npaid within four or five years, while a larger army than ever was raised\r\nand maintained. No one can dispute that the unexampled buoyancy of\r\nFrench finance is due mainly to the sound conditions of French landed\r\ntenure. Ireland, Scotland, and England all await a similar development,\r\nand never can be satisfied without it: but we have postponed the day of\r\nnecessary reform by buying our food of almost every kind, in dangerous\r\namount, from foreign countries, while our own arable land goes back into\r\ngrass and pasture.\r\n\r\nAnd what reply does the Right Hon. John Bright make, when addressed with\r\na claim of reformed landed tenure? His name is here adduced for honour,\r\nas an eminent type of the Cobden School; but the habitual reply is,\r\n\"Good! we are in favour of Free Trade in land:\" as though Free Trade\r\nwere in itself a charm which can scare away all evils; as though the\r\nexisting freedom to accumulate land to any extent by purchase were not\r\none of our greatest mischiefs. Men cannot live in the air. Land for a\r\ndwelling is as essential as air and water. Land is very limited in\r\nquantity, especially land conveniently situated, with favourable\r\nconditions. Land primitively belongs to a nation, and no man naturally\r\nhas any right to more of it than he can himself cultivate and use. Large\r\nlanded estates are a vast power, social and political. Their possession\r\nwas originally in England an official trust, coupled with political\r\nduties and customary dues in payment: but without right of ejectment\r\nwhile those dues were paid. The commercial idea of land is a perversion\r\nand abuse. Those who fancy that the abolition of entails and\r\nprimogeniture and whatever makes conveyances expensive, will bring about\r\nthe desirable reform, boast that their remedy will hoist up the market\r\nprice of land; in other words, it would make an effective purchase by\r\nthe State more and more difficult, more and more burdensome to the\r\ncommunity. Nay, it might even delay the necessary reform, until the\r\npatience of a nation under a landlord Parliament broke down, and such a\r\nrevolution followed as that of France under Louis XVI. As there is a\r\nmoral limit to the magnitude of beneficial commerce with the foreigner,\r\nmuch more is there a moral limit to the beneficial magnitude of landed\r\nestates. Happily some despots are philanthropic; yet we are not in love\r\nwith despotism. Some great landowners are philanthropic: higher honour\r\nbe to them! but we must calculate that very many will covet power over\r\nall who reside on the estate, and will use the power not always kindly;\r\nor will employ it as a political engine to win state-offices and\r\nsalaries for their families; others, more directly and unblushingly\r\nmercenary, will think chiefly how to raise rent, and will forbid both\r\ncrops and inhabitants, if wealthy lovers of occasional sport outbid\r\nordinary farmers. If from mere pride and love of the romantic a landlord\r\nmake his estate a wilderness, the nation still suffers the damage. Its\r\npopulation is cooped into towns or driven into exile, its markets are\r\nstarved, its military force is lowered. While the Cobden School\r\npertinaciously connives at these great evils, and juggles with the\r\nphrase \"Free Trade\" as if land were an article which ought to be on the\r\nsame footing as moveables, they are playing into the hands of their\r\nnominal adversaries.\r\n\r\nThe first measure which we need is not one which shall facilitate the\r\npurchase of new and new estates by the over-wealthy, who, if they are\r\nnot gamblers or otherwise vicious, often know not what to do with their\r\nvast incomes; but much rather a measure which shall set a maximum area\r\nfor estates. The mildest thing to do is, not in the first instance to\r\npass any new _Act_, but only a resolution or _Vote_ of the Commons,\r\ndeclaring that it is against the public interest for any individual to\r\npossess more than a thousand acres of rustic land, or more than five\r\nacres of town land; and that whoever bequeaths to one person more than\r\nthe above-named, ought to be subjected to a heavy and special land tax.\r\nIn the same direction we need other special votes of the House, to the\r\neffect--that by legislation, by purchase, and by taxation the recovery\r\nof the national soil for the nation from year to year ought to be\r\nsystematically pursued, wherever now held in large masses by bodies of\r\nmen or by individuals; and that in order to give to cultivators the full\r\nresults of their own industry, it is expedient that the State, out of\r\nits own present or future domains, carve out numerous small farms to be\r\nheld under it as by copyright tenure, not subject to rise of rent.\r\nSpace does not permit further detail, or reply to objections; but the\r\nidea intended is to work in the direction of _virtual_ freeholds, ever\r\nincreasing in number, which cannot be bought out of the hands of the\r\ncultivators by tempting prices from the rich, because they are legally\r\nState property, and destined to remain as areas of small culture. By\r\nbuying up from time to time the lands possessed by large charities, by\r\nlegacy taxes directed to discourage bequests of land in great mass, and\r\nby direct purchases of land or rather by taking the legacy tax in land\r\nitself, the State would beneficently in the course of many generations\r\nundo the injustices and frauds of the past.\r\n\r\nLand is so far from being a desirable object of unlimited commerce\r\n(called by the Cobden School Free Trade), that, especially under the\r\nmodern interpretation which makes the lord (or chief man) _owner_ of the\r\nland, the most jealous limitations ought to be imposed on it by the\r\nState. So long, indeed, as a man holds no more of it than one family can\r\ncultivate, jealousy is needless; for the holder (especially if he pay a\r\nquit-rent for it) is sure to cultivate it, and cannot offend by\r\nexcluding population. Town land ought, as soon as possible, to become\r\ntown property; and, meanwhile, as early as possible, all town building\r\nto be subjected to a public veto for sanitary reasons. To make away into\r\nmercenary hands, as an article of trade, the whole solid area on which a\r\nnation lives, is astonishing as an idea of statesmanship. There is\r\nanother matter connected with land as to which the State may justly feel\r\ngreat jealousy--namely, as to the consumption and exportation of\r\nmaterial which cannot be reproduced. It is said that Sicily, under the\r\nRomans first, was largely deteriorated by the perpetual exportation of\r\ncorn, exhausting even very fertile soil. Ireland in the past may have\r\nsuffered by the constant sending out of cattle and pigs, with no\r\nback-current of commerce to restore all that their bones and flesh took\r\nout of the earth. Virginia and other States of the American Union\r\nlargely ruined their soil by unceasing exportation of tobacco and other\r\nproducts. But to come closer home, no crops of coal can be grown in\r\nEngland and Wales. We reap where we have not sown, where we cannot sow.\r\nWe export in enormous mass what we cannot reproduce. We allow\r\nindividuals to become, out and out, proprietors of the national coal,\r\nand then sanction their unlimited exportation of it, with the high\r\nprobability that this may cripple industry in the near future of\r\nEngland. This surely is a commerce, the benefit of which is very\r\ndoubtful even in a cosmopolitan view. It may seem better to stimulate\r\nother nations to search for coal on their own soil than to use up what\r\nwe cannot replace. And as for some other articles of immense commerce,\r\nas tobacco, it may seem doubtful which nation loses more by it--the\r\nimporters or the exporters. Surely in all these cases the quality of the\r\nthings bought and sold must be considered carefully, before we regard\r\nthe magnitude of any trade a national benefit or a source of national\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\n    F. W. NEWMAN.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] \"Reciprocity,\" by Sir Louis Mallet, C.B., 1879: Printed for the\r\nCobden Club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MYTHS OF THE SEA AND THE RIVER OF DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present time, when theologians and those who have most aptitude\r\nfor such discussions are arguing \"in thoughts more elevate\" of the\r\nsoul's future life, and its rewards and punishments therein, the\r\npre-historic student is tempted to let _his_ thoughts wander backwards\r\nover a different aspect of the same subject, in an effort to link again\r\nthe chain of belief concerning heaven and hell, which joins this present\r\nwith a long-forgotten past. The difficulty which we feel in uniting\r\nourselves in thought with past ages, arises surely more often from the\r\nimperfection of our sympathies than from the deficiency of our positive\r\nknowledge. So many questions which were once new have long been settled,\r\nso many experiments have been tried, such experiences have been lived\r\nthrough since then; it is so impossible that the earlier conditions of\r\nlife and society should return; and we cannot bring ourselves to make\r\nthe effort of imagination necessary to place us in harmony with bygone\r\ntimes. But there are some few questions which seem as far from\r\nsettlement now as they ever were; one of these is the question\r\nconcerning the destiny of man after death, the character of his journey\r\ninto that undiscovered country, and the sort of life he will lead when\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n    \"A riddle which one shrinks\r\n    To challenge from the scornful sphinx.\"\r\n\r\nSome would dissuade us from the continuance of these (so they say)\r\nunfruitful speculations; but it is very certain that man must change his\r\nnature before they will lose their fascination for him; and until he\r\ndoes so, he cannot read without sympathy the guesses which past\r\ngenerations of men have made towards the solution of the same problems.\r\nFor them, indeed, these solutions have lost their interest, as ours will\r\nsoon do for us. Whatever lot that new condition may hold in store,\r\neternal pleasure or eternal pain, they have tried it now; whatever\r\nscene the dark curtain hides, they have passed behind it. This is very\r\ncertain: as that we soon must. But so long as we remain here upon this\r\nupper earth, we must be something above or below humanity if we refuse\r\never to let our thoughts wander toward the changes and chances of\r\nanother life.\r\n\r\nNot, indeed, that questions of this sort have ever had for the majority\r\nof men in one age, or for the collective mass of human kind, an\r\nall-absorbing interest. If we choose to look closely into the matter,\r\nand to test men's opinion as it is displayed in their actions (the only\r\nreal opinion), we shall at first perhaps be struck by the slight belief\r\nwhich they possess in a future state. For it is slight compared to their\r\n\"notional assent,\" that which they think they believe concerning it.\r\nWith the majority, faith upon this point is at best but shadowy, of an\r\notiose character suitable for soothing the lots of others, and\r\nsometimes, alas! called into requisition to relieve us from the stings\r\nof conscience on account of the pain which our own misconduct or neglect\r\nhas introduced therein. And as it is with us, so, save under exceptional\r\nconditions, it has always been with men in the full vigour and enjoyment\r\nof life. There have been times when one aspect of the future--its\r\nterror--has been realized with an intensity, and has exercised an\r\ninfluence upon life and conduct, such as is unknown in our days. But\r\nthese times have not been ordinary ones, and we are apt, I think, even\r\nto over-estimate the force of faith during the Middle Ages. That term,\r\n\"dark ages,\" overrides our fancy; \"we can never hear mention of them\r\nwithout an accompanying feeling as though a palpable obscure had dimmed\r\nthe face of things, and that our ancestors wandered to and fro\r\ngroping.\"[5] But, then, neither have the most light-hearted and\r\nsceptical of people been able to shut their eyes utterly to the warnings\r\nof death. We are wont to think of the Greeks as of just such a\r\nlight-hearted, and in a fashion sceptical, temperament, and to contrast\r\nthe spirit of Hellas with the spirit of mediæval Europe. Scarcely any\r\nthought of death, or of judgment after death, disturbs the serenity of\r\nGreek art, such as it has come down to us. Thanatos is not to be\r\nfound;[6] even the tombs are adorned with representations of war and of\r\nthe chase, or with figures of the dancing Hours. And yet Greek art was\r\nnot without its darker side. It had, like mediæval poetry, its\r\nDante--Polygnotus, namely--who adorned the pilgrims' house at Delphi\r\nwith frescoes representing the judgment and the tortures of the\r\ndamned,--a Greek Campo Santo. He would have given us a different\r\nimpression of the Greek mind in presence of the fact of mortality, and\r\nshown us how easily we are led to exaggerate the divergence in thought\r\nbetween different nations and different times.\r\n\r\nSo we find as far back as we can test the belief of men, certain\r\ntheories touching the fate of the soul after death, which represent, in\r\nthe germ at least, the prevalent opinions of our own day; and out of\r\nsome of which these opinions have sprung. First among these, probably in\r\npoint of time, stands the purely sceptical theory which takes its rise\r\nfrom the earliest efforts of language to give expression to the unseen.\r\nCasting about for a name for the essential part of man, the life or soul\r\nof him, language finds at first that it has no suitable word, and then\r\nsupplies its want by using the breath--the =psychê=, _spiritus_--in this\r\nsense. Like the vital spark itself, the breath is seen to depart when\r\nthe man dies. Whither has it gone? The purely negative, the purely\r\nsceptical answer would be, \"It has disappeared.\" The answer actually\r\ngiven in most religious creeds is, \"It has gone to the unseen _place_,\"\r\nor the concealed _place_; as the Greeks said, to Hades (=A-idês=); or,\r\nas our Northern ancestors said, to Hel.[7] Thus, out of pure negation we\r\nhave the beginning of a myth: the _spirit_ becomes something definite,\r\nand the place it has gone to is partly realized. The unseen place is\r\nunderground, gained by a dark valley which stretches there from the\r\nupper earth. Enough of the old belief remains to keep this home of the\r\ndead itself dark and shadowy and lifeless. \"The senseless dead, the\r\nsimulacra of mortals,\" as Homer says. And we remember how even a hero\r\nlike Achilles \"would rather be on earth and serve for hire to a man of\r\nmean estate, than rule a king among the dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe same thought is expressed by the Hebrew poet,[8]\r\n\r\n    \"Sheol shall not praise thee, Jehovah,\r\n    The dead shall not celebrate thee;\r\n    They that go down unto the pit shall not hope for thy truth;\r\n    The living, the living, shall praise thee, as I do this day.\"\r\n\r\nNo people have held up this _destructive_ side of death, this negative\r\ntheory of a future, with sharper outline than the Greeks and Hebrews.\r\nWhat a contrast to the teaching of modern religions is that line, \"They\r\nthat go down unto the pit shall not hope for thy truth!\" Other people\r\nhave found themselves unable to rest at this point; they have endowed\r\ntheir place with a personality, but, still strongly impressed with its\r\nhorrors, this personality is grim and fearful. Even with the Greeks,\r\nHades is a person, not a place; with the Teutons, Hel has gone through\r\nthe same transformation: and a thousand other images of horror to be met\r\nwith in different creeds, devouring dragons, dogs who, like Cerberus,\r\nthreaten those who are journeying to the underground kingdom, can be\r\nshown by their names to have sprung from merely negative images of\r\ndeath, the unseen, the coverer, the concealer, the cave of night.\r\n\r\nIn contrast therefore with all these myths stand those which, after\r\ndeath, send the soul upon a journey to some paradise, believed generally\r\nto lie in the west. If these first are myths of hell, the second series\r\nmay be fairly described as myths of heaven. Nor can it be certainly\r\nproved that the more cheerful view of the other world is of a later\r\ngrowth in time than the first which seems so primitive. We see\r\nindications of it in the interments of old stone-age grave mounds. While\r\namong historical people the older Hebrews are the exponents of the\r\ngloomier Sheol, the most hopeful picture of the soul's future finds\r\nexpression in the ritual service of the Egyptians. There we have a\r\ncomplete history of the dead man's journey across the Nile and through\r\nthe twilight region of Apap, king of the desert, until at last it\r\nreaches the home of the sun. And, to come nearer home, among all those\r\npeoples with whom we are allied in blood, the Indo-European family of\r\nnations, we shall find the evidences of a double belief, the belief in\r\ndeath as of a dim underground place or as a devouring monster, and the\r\ncontrasting faith in death as a journey undertaken to reach a new\r\ncountry where everything is better and happier than upon earth.\r\n\r\nThis is the myth of an earthly paradise, not, like our heaven,\r\ndisconnected altogether from the world, but a distant land lying\r\nsomewhere in the west, and forming part of the imaginary geography of\r\nthose times: so the belief is, more than others, a realistic one,\r\nmingling with the daily experience of men and influencing deeply their\r\ndaily life. The necessary portal of death is even sometimes lost sight\r\nof altogether, as when in the Middle Ages we find men undertaking more\r\nthan one expedition in search of the earthly paradise, and when we find\r\nthe current belief that in certain weathers was visible from the west\r\ncoast of Ireland that happy island to which St. Brandon and his\r\ndisciples had been carried when they left this world. For this reason,\r\nthough the notion of the western paradise is essentially the same for\r\nall the human race, its local colouring constantly varies, changing with\r\nthe geographical position of each people: if they change their homes and\r\nadvance, as they will probably do, towards the land of promise, it moves\r\naway before them, as the rainbow moves from us. The Egyptians had their\r\nmyth of the soul's journey, drawing all its distinctive features from\r\nthe special character of their land, chiefly from the commanding\r\ninfluence which a great neighbouring desert exercised upon their\r\nimagination. But for our ancestors, the parents of the Indo-European\r\nraces, the place of the desert was supplied by the sea.\r\n\r\nThe most probable conjecture has fixed the cradle of our race in that\r\ncorner of land which lies westward the steep range of the Beloot Tagh\r\nmountains, an off-shoot of the Himalayas, and northward from the high\r\nbarren land of Cabul. This country, the ancient Bactriana, is the most\r\nhabitable district to be found anywhere in Central Asia. There the hills\r\nstretch out in gentle slopes towards the west, and enclose fertile\r\nvalleys, whose innumerable streams, fed by the mountains east and south,\r\nall go to swell the waters of the Oxus, now called the Jihon. Farther\r\nnorth lies another fruitful country, watered by the Jaxartes, separated\r\nfrom the first by a range of hills much inferior to those which divide\r\nboth lands from Yarkand and Cashgar on the east, and from Cabul on the\r\nsouth. Both the great rivers empty themselves into the Sea of Aral,\r\nbetween which and the Caspian, sharply cutting off the fertile country\r\nfrom that sea, stretches the Khiva desert, a barren land affording a\r\nscanty nourishment to the herds of wandering Turkic tribes. There is\r\ngood reason to believe, however, that this desert did not always exist,\r\nbut that in times not extraordinarily remote the Caspian Sea, joined to\r\nthe Sea of Aral, extended over a much larger area than it at present\r\ncovers: it is known even now to be sinking steadily within its banks.\r\nWith such a contraction of the great sea the desert would grow by a\r\ndouble process, by the laying bare its sandy bed and by the withdrawal\r\nof a neighbouring supply of moisture from the dry land. So it may well\r\nhave been that the fruitful territory wherein in remotest ages were\r\nsettled our Aryan ancestors, stretched so far west as to border upon a\r\nlarge inland Asiatic sea. It has even been conjectured that the turning\r\nof so much fertile land into desert was the proximate cause of those\r\nmigrations which sent the greater part of the Aryan races westward--to\r\npeople, at last, all the countries of Europe. The root which is common\r\nto the European languages for the names of the sea, means, in the Indian\r\nand Iranian languages, a desert: how can we account for this fact better\r\nthan by supposing that after the European nations had left their early\r\nhome, their brethren, who remained behind and who long afterwards\r\nseparated into the people of India and Persia, came to know as a desert\r\nthe district which their fathers had once known as the sea?\r\n\r\nThus, these ancient Aryans stood with their backs toward the mountains\r\nand their faces toward the sea. All their prospect, all their future,\r\nseemed to be that way; when their migrations began they were undertaken\r\nin that direction--towards the west. Most important of all in the\r\nformation of a creed, their sun-god, or sun-hero,[9] was seen by many of\r\nthem quenching his beams in the waters; the home of the sun is always\r\nlikewise the home of souls. What more natural, nay, what so necessary,\r\nas that the Aryan paradise should lie westward beyond the sea? It has\r\nbeen said just now that the Indian word for desert corresponds\r\netymologically with the European word for sea: that word must have been,\r\nin the old Aryan, something like _mara_, from which we get the Persian\r\n_meru_, desert, the Latin _mare_, the Teutonic (German and English)\r\n_meer_. But from identically the same root we likewise get the Sanksrit\r\nand the Zend (old Persian) _mara_, death, the Latin _mors_, the old\r\nNorse _mordh_, the German _mord_, our _murder_, all signifying\r\noriginally the same thing.[10] What, then, does this imply? The word\r\nwhich the old Aryans used for sea they used likewise for death. How\r\nwould this be possible, unless this, their first sea, were likewise the\r\nsea of death, the necessary stage upon the road to paradise?\r\n\r\nIt might have been expected that such a connection of ideas would have\r\nendowed the sea with an entirely terrible character, precluding any\r\nattempt to explore its solitudes, or the lands which lay beyond. It has\r\nbeen already said that as a matter of experience we find that the\r\n_earthly_ paradise often comes to be realized so vividly that men lose\r\nthe fear which should attach to any attempt at finding it. They were not\r\nreligious, heavenward-looking men who, in Mr. Morris's poem, set out in\r\nquest of the happy land; and no doubt the bard has been guided by a true\r\ninstinct, and that of all those mediæval mariners who were lost in their\r\nsearch after St. Brandon's isle, none knew that they had found what they\r\nwere seeking--Death. The Greeks eagerly cherished delusions of the same\r\nkind; and long before they had summoned up courage sufficient to\r\nnavigate the Mediterranean they had invented the myths of their western\r\nislands of the blest, to which yellow-haired Rhadamanthus was taken when\r\nexpelled from Crete by his brother Minos, or of those gardens kept by\r\nthe daughters of the west,[11] where decay and death could not enter. It\r\nis likely enough that for the Aryans _their_ western sea did long retain\r\nits more fearful meaning, _a death_; but that they at last gained\r\ncourage to look upon it only as _the road_[12] to the land of which they\r\nhad long been dreaming.\r\n\r\nHow much more weighty a position the sea takes in men's thoughts than is\r\nwarranted by their real familiarity with it! Into the mass of sedentary\r\nlives--the vast majority--it enters but seldom as an experience,\r\nprovided a man live only a few miles inland. And yet of all countries\r\nwhich possess a sea-board, how full is the literature of reference to\r\nthis one phenomenon of physical nature! The sun and the moon, and all\r\nthe heavenly bodies, the familiar sights and sounds of land, are the\r\nproperty of all; and yet allusions to these are not more common in\r\nliterature than allusions to the sea: one might fancy that man was\r\namphibious, with a power of actually living _upon_, and not only _by_,\r\nthe water. Charles Lamb acutely penetrates the cause of a certain\r\ndisappointment we all feel at the sight of the sea for the first time.\r\nWe go with the expectation of seeing all the sea at once, the\r\ncommensurate antagonist of the earth. All that we have gathered from\r\nnarratives of wandering seamen, what we have gained from true voyages,\r\nand what we cherish as credulously from romances and poetry, come\r\ncrowding their images, and exacting strange tributes from expectation.\r\nThus we are imbued with thoughts of the sea before we have had any sight\r\nof it ourselves, merely by the sea's great influence acting through the\r\ntotal experience of humanity. \"We think of the great deep and of those\r\nwho go down unto it: of its thousand isles, and of the vast continents\r\nit washes; of its receiving the mighty Plata, or Orellana, into its\r\nbosom, without disturbance or sense of augmentation; of Biscay swells\r\nand the mariner--\r\n\r\n    \"For many a day and many a dreadful night,\r\n    Incessant labouring round the stormy cape;\r\n\r\nof fatal rocks and the 'still-vexed Bermoothes;' of great whirlpools and\r\nthe water-spout; of sunken ships and sumless treasures swallowed up in\r\nthe unrestoring depths.\" We must not narrow the influence of the sea in\r\nmythology within the compass of man's mere experience of it. Few among\r\nthe Aryans lived by the Caspian shore; but the Sea of Death appears in\r\none form or another in the religious belief of all the Aryan people. The\r\ntradition of the sea, its real wonders, and greater fancied terrors,\r\nmust have passed from one to another, from the few who lived within\r\nsight and sound of the waters to others quite beyond its horizon, to\r\nwhom it was not visible even as a faint silvery line.\r\n\r\nIt is natural that, in early myths, no accurate distinction should have\r\nbeen drawn between the sea and rivers with which the Aryans were\r\nfamiliar. The Caspian was imagined a broad river bounding the habitable\r\nearth, the origin of the Oceanus of the Greeks; and the sea of death is,\r\nin its earliest form, a river of death. All after-forms of mythical\r\ngeography, moreover, such as we find among Indians, Greeks, or Norsemen,\r\nare but graftings upon this central idea. As the Aryans changed their\r\nhomes, the new experiences gradually blotted out the old. The Greek\r\ntransferred his thoughts about the Caspian to the Mediterranean, and\r\nwhen his geography extended, the Oceanus was pushed farther and farther\r\naway, until the later Euhemerist geographers came to confound it with\r\nthe Atlantic. Thus it is but by accident that we give to ocean the\r\nmeaning which it now bears. The first ocean was the mythical river which\r\nflowed round the earth, and the real physical forerunner of the myth was\r\nnot the Atlantic or any of our oceans, but the Caspian Sea as it\r\nstretched before the eyes of the ancient Aryan folk.\r\n\r\nThe Norseman, especially the Icelander,[13] lived so close to the ocean,\r\nthat the older myth was forgotten beside the aspect of nature so\r\nfamiliar to him. In the middle of his earth stood a high mountain, on\r\nwhich was a strong city, Asgaard, the house of the Æsir or gods. Below\r\nAsgaard lay the green and fruitful earth, man's home. Then outside\r\nflowed or lay the great mid-earth ocean, just like the Greek ocean in\r\ncharacter, despite all differences of climate and country. At other\r\ntimes the mid-earth sea is personified as a devouring monster,\r\nJörmungandr (\"great monster\"), the name of the mid-gaard serpent who\r\nlies at the bottom of the encircling sea, shaking the earth when he\r\nmoves.[14] Beyond, lies the ice-bound land of giants--Jötunheim, giant's\r\nhome--dark like the Cimmerian land, and peopled with beings as weird and\r\nterrible as the Cyclops or the Gorgons.\r\n\r\nGradually the myths of the river of death and the sea of death from\r\nbeing one became two. The second was confined to those nations who lived\r\nupon the sea-shore, and lost in great part its early shape; but neither\r\nIndians, Greeks, nor Norsemen forgot the myth of the mortal river. The\r\nIndian retained it singly; for when his turn for wandering came, he\r\npassed over the eastern mountains and reached a land where no sea was\r\nany longer to be seen or heard of. In the mythical language of the\r\nVedas, the mortal river is called Vaitera_n_i; it lies \"across the\r\ndreadful path to the house of Yama,\"[15] the god of Hell.\r\n\r\nFrom the belief in the river of death no doubt arose also the practice\r\nof committing the dead to the care of the sacred Ganges; for just as the\r\nHindus kindle a funeral fire in the boat which bears the dead down this\r\nvisible stream of death, so used the Norsemen to place their hero's body\r\nin his ship, and then having lighted it send it drifting out seawards\r\nwith the tide. In conjunction with that thought of the other world which\r\nplaced the final resting-place in a dark kingdom underground, the river\r\nis seen in Greek mythology transferred to Hades; but it is multiplied\r\ninto four, which have all grown out of one, inasmuch as they were\r\nfeigned to flow out of the upper-earth river Oceanus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate;\r\n    Sad Acheron, of sorrow, black and deep;\r\n    Cocytus named of lamentation loud\r\n    Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegethon\r\n    Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.\"\r\n\r\nThese pictures are not quite in character with the Hellenic thought\r\nabout the future state. But it is certain that the more gloomy images of\r\ndeath are preserved in connection with the rivers of Hades, with Hades\r\nitself, and all that it contains. So it is with the northern Styx,\r\nGjöll,[16] as it is called in the Eddas. This, too, is an underground\r\nstream lying, like the Indian, on the road to the gates of death.\r\n\r\nThus a separation arises between the sea and the river myths. If we wish\r\nfor something more cheerful than the pictures of Styx and Gjöll and\r\nVaitera_n_i, we must look, for the tales of an earthly paradise which\r\nsprang up when men had lost their first terror of the sea, but had not\r\nlost the beliefs to which their earliest thoughts about that sea gave\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nSuch beliefs are those which lie enshrined in the Odyssey. This poem is\r\nfull of images of death, but they are not self-conscious ones, only\r\nmythical expressions first applied to the passage of the soul from life,\r\nand then made literal and physical by their transference to the\r\nunexplored western sea. What the Caspian may have been to the ancient\r\nAryan, such was the Mediterranean to the Greek. The Ægean was his\r\nhome-like water; there he might pass from island to island without\r\nlosing sight of land; and he soon learnt to trust himself to its care,\r\nand to know its currents and its winds. Long before he had navigated\r\nbeyond Cape Malea, all the coasts of the Ægean had become parts of his\r\nfamiliar world: outside this was the region of the unknown. The Iliad\r\ntells us what the early Greeks thought about the first. Myths may have\r\nmingled with the legend of the fall of Troy, but the story in Homer is\r\nessentially realistic, rationalistic even. The very powers of the\r\nimmortals and their doings seem petty and limited. The Odyssey, on the\r\nother hand, is the product of the Greek imagination working in fields\r\nunturned by experience, free from any guiding impulse of knowledge; and\r\nhere step in those monstrous shapes and strange adventures which differ\r\naltogether from the probable events of the Iliad. We feel at once that\r\nwe are in a new world, a world not so much of supernatural beings as of\r\nmagic; lands of glamour and illusion, most like the giant-land of the\r\nNorsemen; for we are getting towards the twilight regions of the earth\r\nand the borders of Hades.\r\n\r\nSome writers have attempted to explain the Odyssey as nothing more than\r\na myth of the sun's course through heaven. But surely there is too much\r\nsolidity about the story, too thorough an atmosphere of belief around\r\nit, to suit a tale relating such airy unrealities as those. The Greeks\r\nwho first sung the ballads must have been thinking of a real journey\r\nupon this solid earth. But it is easy to see how many images and notions\r\nwhich had first been applied only to the sun-god would creep into such a\r\nhistory as that of Odysseus. Undoubtedly the sun-myth had first pointed\r\nout the home of the dead as lying in the west; and nothing is more\r\nnatural than that a people whose thoughts and hopes carried them in the\r\ntrack of the wandering sun should, when they came to construct an epos\r\nof travel, make the imaginary journey lie the same way. They would\r\ninterweave in the story such truths--or such sailors' yarns--as\r\nPhoenician mariners or adventurous Greeks brought home from the distant\r\nwaters, with many images which had been first made of the sun's heavenly\r\nvoyage, and others which had been first applied to death. Their\r\ngeography would, indeed, be mythical; for they could have no accurate\r\nnotions of the lands which they spoke of; but it would not be without a\r\nkernel of reality. Justin and Augustine may look upon the garden of the\r\nHesperides or the garden of Alcinoüs as a reminiscence of Paradise;\r\nStrabo may assign them an exact position on the coast of Libya; and both\r\nmay be right. The myth of the two gardens--the Hebrew and the Greek\r\nparadises--sprang up in obedience to an identical faculty of belief, and\r\ntherefore the two stories are in origin the same. But each myth\r\nsupported itself upon so much of reality as it could lay hold of: and it\r\nis likely enough that the famous golden apples which Hercules was sent\r\nto fetch owed their origin to the first oranges brought by Phoenician\r\nmerchantmen to Greece.\r\n\r\nBesides some such slender thread of reality, the adventures of Odysseus\r\nare built upon what men's imagination told them might lie in the western\r\nseas. Now in reality there was only one thing which at the bottom of\r\ntheir hearts they believed actually did lie there--namely, death; and\r\nbeyond that, the home of the departed. Therefore their stories of\r\nadventure in the Mediterranean do all, upon a minute inspection, resolve\r\nthemselves into a variety of mythical ways of describing death; and upon\r\nthis as a dark background the varied colours of the tale are painted.\r\nIt need take away no jot of our pleasure in the brilliant picture to\r\nacknowledge this. Nay, it gather adds to it, for behind the graceful air\r\nof the poem, sung as a poem only, we hear a deeper note telling of the\r\npassionate, obstinate questionings of futurity which belonged not more\r\nto Greece three thousand years ago than they now belong to us.\r\n\r\nAny one acquainted with the genesis of myth would at once be disposed to\r\nsee in the Odyssey the combination of two different legends; for one\r\nseries of adventures comes as a tale told during the course of the\r\nsecond. We first see our hero on the island of Calypso, the sea-nymph;\r\nand when Hermes has brought from the gods the command for his release,\r\nhe is carried thence by storms to the land of the Phæaceans. There\r\nNausicaa finds him and brings him to her father Alcinoüs, by whom he is\r\nhospitably entertained, and at last sent back to Ithaca, his home. This\r\nforms one complete legend, the simplest and probably the first, because\r\n_into_ it is woven the account of Odysseus' earlier adventures. In the\r\nhalls of Alcinoüs the wanderer tells what happened to him before he\r\nreached the cave of Calypso, and in this narrative we follow him to the\r\nisland of the Lotus-eaters, to the island of the Cyclops, thence to the\r\nhouse of Circe, and from there to the very borders of hell itself. And\r\nwe guess that we have here got hold of a later amplified legend built up\r\nout of the earlier myth. We find just such changes as this in Norse\r\nmythology; a story told in a few lines by the elder Edda, is expanded\r\ninto an elaborate history in the younger. Looking again more closely at\r\nthe Odyssey, we discover that many circumstances in the expanded tale\r\nbear close resemblance to one or other of the adventures in the shorter\r\ncategory. Take, for instance, the life with Calypso and with Circe. Both\r\nCalypso and Circe are nymphs, enchantresses; each lives alone upon her\r\nisland: with each Odysseus passes a term of years, living with her as\r\nher husband, longing all the while to return to his own wife and his own\r\nhome, and yet unable to do so: from each Hermes is the deliverer. What\r\nif Calypso and Circe both repeat in reality the same myth; and what if\r\nOdysseus' other great adventure, the voyage to the Phæaceans, have\r\nlikewise its counterpart in the expanded story? The question of the real\r\nidentity or difference of the two stories can only be decided when we\r\nhave seen how much significance there is in the points of their apparent\r\nlikeness.\r\n\r\nWho is Calypso? Her name bespeaks her nature not ambiguously. It is from\r\n=kalyptein=, to cover or conceal. She is the shrouder, or the shrouded\r\nplace, answering exactly therefore to Hel, which, as has before been\r\nsaid, comes from the verb _helja_, \"to hide.\" How, then, can Calypso be\r\nanything else than death, as she dwells there in her cave, by the shores\r\nof the sea? How can Odysseus' life with her, his sleep in her cave, be\r\nanything else than an image of dying? The gods have determined that the\r\nhero shall not remain in this mortal sleep for ever; so Hermes is sent\r\nto command Calypso to let Odysseus go. Hermes is the god whose mission\r\nit is to lead souls down to the realm of Hades--the psychopomp, as in\r\nthis office he is called. But sometimes he may come upon an opposite\r\nmessage, to restore men to life; the staff which closes the eyes of men\r\nmay likewise open them when asleep. On such a task he comes--\r\n\r\n    \"Wind-like beneath, the immortal golden sandals\r\n    Bare up his flight o'er the limitless earth and the sea;\r\n    And in his hand that magic wand he carried,\r\n    Wherewith the eyes of men he closes in slumber,\r\n    Or wakens from sleeping.\"\r\n\r\nHe comes like the breath of morning awakening the world, to rouse our\r\nhero from the embrace of death; and the whole scene is beautifully\r\nattuned to an image of returning life. Therefore the interference of\r\nHermes between Odysseus and Calypso is full of significance. We\r\naccordingly meet the same episode in the Circe tale. That this last is a\r\nlater widening of the first story appears from many things; chiefly in\r\nthis, that there is more moral in the history; for the truest myth is\r\ncontent to follow the actual workings of nature, without attempting to\r\nadorn a story with extraneous incident, or to convert its simplicity\r\ninto the complexities of allegory. That turning the companions into\r\nswine was a punishment for luxury--that points the moral; the original\r\nCirce, we may be sure, only touched her lovers with her sleepy magic\r\nrod. It was the same wand with the \"slepy yerde\"[17] of Hermes, and she\r\nused it not wantonly but only because all whom she embraces must fall\r\ninto the unwakeful slumber. If Circe's name does not reveal her nature\r\nso nakedly as Calypso's does, this is but consistent with the fact of\r\nher later creation. Nevertheless, we easily recognise by it death in one\r\nof its many types--a ravenous animal or bird, a hawk or wolf.[18]\r\n\r\nWhen Odysseus is freed from the fatal embrace of Calypso, he is not at\r\nonce restored to the common earth, but from his descent into hell goes\r\nheavenwards, or at least to the happy islands of the blessed. The land\r\nof the Phæaceans, Scheria, can scarcely be anything else than this\r\nParadise, to which, according to one myth, Rhadamanthus fled from his\r\nbrother Minos when he reigned in Crete. The Phæaceans, too, have had\r\ndealings with \"yellow-haired Rhadamanthus,\" whom they carried back in\r\ntheir swift barques to Euboea. The name of their island is merely land,\r\nshore;[19] perhaps at first only the farther coast of the sea of death.\r\n\r\n    \"Far away do we live at the end of the watery plain,\r\n    Nor before now have we ever had dealings with other mortals;\r\n    But now there comes some luckless wanderer hither.\r\n    Him it is right that we help; for all men, fellows and strangers,\r\n    Come from Zeus; in his sight the smallest gift is pleasing.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThey live close to the gods, and in familiar converse with them. It is a\r\nplace where decay and death cannot enter. In the gardens of Alcinoüs\r\nflowers and fruit do not grow old and disappear; winter does not succeed\r\nto summer; all is one continuous round of blossoming and bearing fruit;\r\nin one part of the garden the trees are all abloom; in another they are\r\nheavy with clusters. There it _is_, as in that wizard's tower of\r\nMiddle-Age legend it only _seemed_ to be--\r\n\r\n    \"That from one window men beheld the spring,\r\n    And from another saw the summer glow,\r\n    And from a third the fruited vines arow.\"[21]\r\n\r\nIn name the Phæaceans appear as beings of the twilight--=phaiax=,\r\nstrengthened from =phaios=, dusky, dim. Their most wondrous possessions\r\nare their ships, which know the thoughts of men, and sail swifter than a\r\nbird or than thought. \"No pilots have they, no rudders, no oarsmen,\r\nwhich other ships have, for they themselves know the thoughts and minds\r\nof men. The rich fields they know, and the cities among all men, and\r\nswiftly pass over the crests of the sea, shrouded in mist and\r\ngloom.\"[22] Yet the Phæaceans themselves live remote from human\r\nhabitation, unused to strangers. It would seem, therefore, that the\r\nships travel alone on their dark voyages. For what purpose? It is not\r\ndifficult to guess. Their part is to carry the souls of dead men over to\r\nthe land of Paradise.[23] We can imagine them sailing in every human\r\nsea; calling at every port, familiar with every city, though in their\r\nshroud of darkness they are unseen by men. They know all the rich lands,\r\nfor every land has its tribute to pay to the ships of death. They are\r\nthe exact counterparts of the \"grim ferryman which poets write of;\" only\r\nthat the last plies his business in the ancient underground Hades, while\r\nthe Phæacean mariners are really believed to be inhabitants of the upper\r\nearth; albeit they can pass from this life to the other.\r\n\r\nTheir business with Odysseus is to bring him back to the common world of\r\nGreece--to beloved Ithaca. He has passed to the cave of Hel, and emerged\r\nfrom it to visit the land of Paradise; now he returns, that his\r\nadventures may be sung in the homes of Greece. How could men ever tell\r\ntales of that strange country, if it really were a shore from which no\r\ntraveller returned? Accordingly, this traveller is laid to sleep in the\r\nblack barque of the Phæaceans, \"a sweet sleep, unwakeful, nearest like\r\nto death; and as arose the one brightest star to herald the morning, the\r\nsea-troubled ship touched the shore.\"[24] Thus end the adventures of the\r\nwanderer; and, as far as regards the belief concerning the sea of death,\r\nthis is all his adventures can tell us. His doings with the Cyclops,\r\nwith the Lotus-eaters, have their relationship with the same belief; but\r\nthey scarcely bring in any new elements; they only change the method of\r\ntheir treatment and symbolize them in a new way. Hades is more\r\ndistinctly treated of in the second series; and this is enough to show\r\nus that the mortal character of the whole journey has been lost sight of\r\nmore completely than in the first myths; so we noticed before, that the\r\nsignificance of Calypso's name is half forgotten when her part is\r\nassigned to Circe. The journey to Hades from Circe's island, Ææa,\r\ntallies exactly with the journey to Scheria from the island of Calypso;\r\nonly, for the island of the blest is substituted the underground home of\r\nsouls; and when Odysseus addresses there his companion, Elpenor, whom he\r\nhad but a little while ago left dead on Circe's island, and asks him how\r\nhe could have come under the dark west more quickly on foot than\r\nOdysseus did sailing in a black ship, we see that the meaning of the\r\nocean journey is forgotten, and that a sort of confusion has arisen\r\nbetween the Hades under men's feet, to which the souls of the dead\r\ndescend, and the Hades at the end of the journey lying far away. This\r\npart, then, is not significant of the Greek belief concerning an earthly\r\nParadise. The learned Welcker, who first showed how these Phæacean ships\r\nwere the carriers of souls,[25] wishes also to connect the myth with\r\nsome non-Hellenic source. He supposes it to have been gathered from the\r\nTeutons. But surely we are not obliged to go so far, unless we are\r\nprepared to consider Charon non-Hellenic also; and no one can really\r\npretend that. For the Phæacean myth is in many ways truer than the myth\r\nof Charon and Styx. Styx is but the earth-river (or sea), Oceanus,\r\ntransferred to beneath the earth; and the story of the ferryman is a\r\ncompromise between the two creeds--that of the _under_-world and that of\r\nthe western paradise beyond sea; while the myth of the Phæaceans is a\r\nsimple expression of the last. The connection which we find between\r\nGreek and German in these beliefs is derivable only from their common\r\nancestry--not from a contact in later days. Certainly these legends have\r\ntheir close counterparts in Norse mythology; the two series only require\r\nto be stripped of local colouring, and some unessential details, to\r\ndisplay very clearly their common brotherhood. How curious, for\r\ninstance, is it to see that Calypso corresponds literally in name with\r\nthe Northern goddess of the dead, Hel! Another myth, the story of the\r\nburning of Baldur, repeats the same images of death which we trace in\r\nthe legend of Odysseus.\r\n\r\nBaldur is quite evidently the sun-god. Less of a hero, more of a god,\r\nthan Odysseus, he is nevertheless mortal--as, indeed, all the Norse gods\r\nare--and falls pierced by the hand of his own brother, Hödur. Then his\r\ncorpse is placed upon his ship, Hringhorn, and sent out upon this, as on\r\na pyre, drifting into the ocean. We can imagine how to the Norsemen upon\r\ntheir stormy seas, the image of the sun dying red upon the western\r\nwaters recalled the story of Baldur's burning ship. The Viking imitated\r\nhis god in this, and when his time came ordered his funeral fire to be\r\nlighted in like manner upon a ship and himself to be set sailing, as\r\nBaldur was. After this we are brought in the myth to the underground\r\nkingdom of Hel, and there the goddess entertains Baldur, as Calypso\r\nentertained Odysseus, making ready her best to do him honour, and\r\nseating him in the highest place in her hall. Then the gods take\r\ncounsel how Baldur is to be brought back again, and one of them,\r\nHermödr,[26] the messenger, like Hermes, is sent to beg Hel to let\r\nBaldur out of Helheim. Fate and death are more powerful in northern\r\nlands than they are in Greece. The gods cannot command that this Calypso\r\nshould let her prisoner go; and alas! they do not even obtain an answer\r\nto their prayer save on conditions which they are unable to fulfil. Hel\r\nwill set Baldur free, if all things, both living and dead, weep for him;\r\nbut if one thing refuses to weep, then he must remain in the\r\nunder-world. Thereupon the gods sent messengers over the whole earth,\r\ncommanding all things, living and lifeless, to weep Baldur out of\r\nHelheim; all things freely complied with the request, both men and\r\nstones, and trees and metals; until as the messengers were returning,\r\ndeeming that their mission was accomplished, they met an old witch\r\nsitting in a cave, and she refused to weep, saying, \"Let Hel keep her\r\nown.\"[27] This old witch is Calypso or Circe in another guise. Her name\r\nis Thokk, that is, darkness (dökkr).\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic people had many myths and stories about the carrying the\r\ndead across the sea. We have signalized the belief in such a passage as\r\nthe origin of those countless mediæval legends of the earthly Paradise:\r\ndoubtless it is the parent of the modern superstition that ghosts will\r\nnot cross the running water. Side by side with the story of the\r\nPhæaceans we may place the superstition which Procopius records touching\r\nour own island. The Byzantine historian of Justinian seems to have had\r\nbut vague ideas of the position of Britain, which, by the tide of\r\nTeutonic invasion across the Rhine, had long been cut off from\r\nintercourse with the Empire. These Easterns were careless and ignorant\r\nof the remote West. So Procopius speaks of Britannia as lying opposite\r\nto Spain; and then he mentions another island, Brittia--evidently in\r\nreality our island--which faces the northern coast of Gaul, and of this\r\nhe tells the following strange story:--There is, he declares, an island\r\ncalled Brittia, which lies in the Northern Seas. It is separated into\r\ntwo divisions by a wall;[28] and on one side of this wall the air is\r\nhealthy and the land fertile and pleasant, and all things most apt for\r\nhuman habitation. But on the other side the air is so noxious that no\r\none can breathe in it for an hour: it is given up to serpents and\r\npoisonous animals and plants. Yet not entirely; for this is the home of\r\nthe dead. Then he goes on to relate how the fishermen who inhabit the\r\ncoast opposite this part of Brittia have to perform the strange duty of\r\ncarrying the souls across the strait. Each does his office in rotation;\r\nwhen the man's night has come he is awoke by a knocking at his door, but\r\nwhen he opens it, sees no one. He goes down to the shore, and finds\r\nthere strange vessels, which, though empty to mortal eyes, lie deep in\r\nthe water as though weighed down by some freight. Stepping in, each\r\nfisherman takes his rudder, and then by an unfelt wind the vessels are\r\nwafted in one night across the channel, a distance which, with oar and\r\nsail, they could usually scarce accomplish in eight. Arrived at the\r\nopposite side--our coast--the fishermen heard names called over and\r\nvoices answering in rota, and they felt the boats becoming light. Then,\r\nwhen all the ghosts were landed, they were carried back to Gaul. We may\r\npicture them returning to the habitable world in the first glow of\r\nmorning, or with the one bright morning star which shone on Odysseus\r\nlanding at Ithaca.\r\n\r\nSo much for the myth of the sea, or river, of death. A most important\r\nchange was wrought in belief when the custom of burning the dead was\r\nintroduced. It would seem that our Aryan ancestors were the beginners of\r\nthis rite. Whence it arose we cannot say; but if the God of Fire was a\r\nprominent divinity, the thought of committing the dead into his charge\r\nseems a simple and natural one. Among the Aryan people the only deep\r\ntraces of fire-worship are to be seen in the Vedic and Iranian\r\nreligions,[29] while the fire-burial survived in all: but the former may\r\nwell have held a prominent place in their older creed. Or--and this is\r\nfar from unlikely--the custom of fire-burial may have arisen out of the\r\nsun myth, just as the belief in the soul's journey after death was\r\nsuggested by watching the sun's journey to the west. The two great\r\nfire-funerals mentioned in Greek and Teutonic mythology are the funerals\r\nof sun-gods. Heracles burning on Mount OEta, on the western coast of the\r\nÆgean, may have been first thought of by Greeks who saw the sun setting\r\nin fire over that sea; and Baldur's bale on the ship _Hringhorn_ is\r\nevidently the Norse edition of the same story, his blazing ship the\r\nblaze in the sky, as the sun sinks into the water. Burning the dead\r\nnever seems to have been a universal practice; rather a special honour\r\npaid to kings and heroes. But then we must remember that immortality\r\nitself was not, in ancient belief, granted to all men indiscriminately,\r\nonly to the greatest.\r\n\r\nWe see at once that with the use of fire-burial many of the old beliefs\r\nhad to be given up; all those, for instance, which depended upon the\r\npreservation of the bodily remains. Of old time men had buried treasures\r\nwith the corpse in the expectation that they would be of some kind of\r\nuse to it; the body itself was at first imagined to descend to the\r\nunder-world or to travel the western journey to the home of the sun. But\r\nnow the body is visibly consumed upon the funeral pile, where, too, are\r\nplaced, by a curious survival of old custom, the precious things which\r\nwould formerly have been buried with it in the ground. The body and\r\nthese things have been consumed, are gone; where have they gone? Have\r\nthey perished utterly, and is there nothing more left than the earliest\r\nbelief of an =A-idês=--a nowhere; is nothing true of all those myths of\r\nthe soul passing away to a home of bliss? Instead of giving up this\r\nfaith, the Aryan people have only spiritualized it, robbed it of the too\r\nliteral and earthly clothing which in earlier times it wore. The thought\r\nwhich had once identified the life with the breath comes again into\r\nforce, or, if some material representation is still wished for, we have\r\nthe smoke of the funeral pyre, which rises heavenwards like an ascending\r\nsoul. In this spirit we find in long after years, in the description of\r\nthe funeral fire of Beowulf the Goth, it is said that the soul of the\r\nhero _wand to wolcum_, \"curled to the clouds,\" imaging the smoke which\r\nwas curling up from his pyre. There is even a curious analogy between\r\nthe words for _smoke_ and _soul_ in the Aryan languages, showing how\r\nclosely the two ideas were once allied. From a primitive root _dhu_,\r\nwhich means to shake or blow, we get both the Sanskrit root _dhuma_,\r\nsmoke, and the Greek =thymos=, the immaterial part of man, his thought\r\nor soul. =Thymos= is not a mere abstraction like our word mind, but that\r\nwhich could live when the body was killed or wasted to death by\r\ndisease.[30]\r\n\r\nEvidently, therefore, even the inanimate things, the weapons and\r\ntreasures which are burnt with the dead, survive in a land of essences\r\nfor the use of the liberated soul. To the question, Where does man's\r\nessence go to when it rises from the funeral fire? the answer, if the\r\nwish alone urged the thought, would be \"To the gods.\" But with the\r\nmajority of burying people the belief in future union with the gods was\r\nnot strongly insisted upon. The islands of the blest are certainly not\r\nto be confounded with Olympus; although the Phæaceans claim to live very\r\nnear the gods.[31] Yet with the use of burning, and among the Aryan\r\npeople, the hope gains a measure of strength. The gods of the Aryan\r\nwere, before everything, gods of the air. As the soul and the smoke\r\nmounted upwards, \"curled to the clouds,\" the belief of its having gone\r\nto join the gods--chief god, Dyâus, the air--was impressed more vividly\r\nupon his mind. And as the notion of the western journey to the home of\r\nthe sun was not abandoned, a natural compromise would be to send the\r\nsoul upwards to the path of the sun, and make its voyage a voyage in\r\nheaven, led by the sun or by the wind. But his path still lay westward;\r\nthe home of the dead ancestors lay beyond the western boundary; there\r\nwas still an Oceanus to be crossed, and a dark Cimmerian land to be\r\npassed through.\r\n\r\nThe heavenly path taken by the soul becomes, in the eye of mortals, a\r\n_bridge_ spanning the celestial arch, and carrying them over the river\r\nof death; and men would soon begin asking themselves where lay this\r\nheavenly road. Night is necessarily associated with thoughts of\r\ndeath--\"Death, and his brother Sleep\"--and of the other world. The\r\nheavens wear a more awful aspect than by day. The sun has forsaken us,\r\nand is himself buried beneath the earth; and a million dwellers in the\r\nupper regions, who were before unseen, now appear to sight--the stars,\r\nwho in so many mythologies are associated with souls. Among the stars we\r\nsee a bright, yet misty, bow bent overhead: can this be other than the\r\ndestined bridge of souls? The ancient Indians called this road\r\ngods'-path, because besides that it was the way for souls to God, it was\r\nalso the way from gods to men. They also called it the\r\ncow-path--_gôpatha_, meaning possibly cloud-path--from which it is\r\nlikely we derive our name for it, \"the Milky-way.\" The Low-German name\r\nfor the Milky-way is _kau-pat_--_i.e., kuh-pfad_, cow-path. But in their\r\nhymns the Indians oftenest speak of it as the path of Yama, the way to\r\nthe house of Yama, the god of the dead:--\r\n\r\n\"A narrow path, an ancient one, stretches there, a path untrodden by\r\nmen, a path I know of:\r\n\r\n\"On it the wise who have known Brahma ascend to the world Svarga, when\r\nthey have received their dismissal,\" sings a Sanskrit poet.[32]\r\n\r\nAnother (R. V. i. 38. 5) prays the Maruts, the gods of the wind, not to\r\nlet him wander on the path of Yama, or, when he does so--that is, when\r\nhis time shall come--to keep him that he fall not into the hands of\r\nNirrtis, the Queen of Naraka (Tartarus). In another place we find as\r\nguardians of the bridge two dogs, the dogs of Yama, and the dead man is\r\ncommitted to their care:--\r\n\r\n\"Give him, O king Yama, to the two dogs, the watchers, the four-eyed\r\nguardians of the path, guardians of men: grant him safety and freedom\r\nfrom pain.\"\r\n\r\nThus stands out in its complete development the myth of the Bridge of\r\nSouls: a narrow path spanning the arch of heaven, passing over the\r\ndwelling of Nirrtis, the Queen of Tartarus (perhaps not clearly\r\ndistinguishable from the river of death), and reaching at last the\r\ncountry of the wise Pitris, the \"fathers\" of the tribe, who have gone to\r\nheaven before, and who since their death have not ceased to keep watch\r\nover the descendants of their race. This road is guarded by two dogs,\r\nthe dogs of Yama, both wardens of the bridge and likewise psychopomps,\r\nor leaders of the soul up the strait road.\r\n\r\nThis was essentially an Indian myth--or perhaps an Indian and\r\nIranian--and took the place of the myth of the sea journey, as it was\r\nconceived by Greeks and Germans. The Indians and Iranians had never a\r\nsea of death, so they could not have such ferrymen as the Phæaceans, or\r\nlegends such as the voyages of Odysseus and the burning of Baldur. In\r\nthe place of them, and with their mortal _river_, they adopted this\r\nBridge of Souls. The guardians are manifold in their nature; for their\r\nnames show them related both to Cerberus, who guards Hades, and to\r\nHermes, who leads the souls of the dead below; and, so far as we can\r\ngather from the Vedas, these dogs of Yama discharged both offices,\r\nsometimes keeping the bridge and sometimes conducting souls along it.\r\n\"Give him,\" says the prayer, \"O Yama, to the two dogs.\" No doubt their\r\nterrors were for the wicked only, and they are thus apt images of\r\ndeath:--\r\n\r\n    \"Death comes to set thee free;\r\n    Oh, meet him cheerily\r\n      As thy true friend.\"[33]\r\n\r\nStill, as we see from their appearance, the dreadful aspect of death\r\npredominates. In like forms, as dogs or wolves, they return time out of\r\nmind in Norse mythology and in Middle-Age legend.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that this myth of the Bridge of Souls was essentially\r\nIndian and Iranian (old Persian). It is often most difficult to\r\nascertain what were the ancient Persian beliefs: but in this case the\r\nmyth has been handed down to us from the Persians through the Arabs, a\r\npeople possessing of right no part or lot in its construction. It is\r\ngenerally acknowledged that Mohammed took from the Persians that famous\r\nbridge so vividly described in the Korân.[34] Es-Sirât is the bridge's\r\nname. It is finer than a hair and sharper than the edge of a sword, and\r\nis, besides, guarded with thorns and briars along all its length.\r\nNevertheless, when, at the last day, the good Muslim comes to cross it,\r\na light will shine upon him from heaven, and he will be snatched across\r\nlike lightning or like the wind; but when the wicked man or the\r\nunbeliever approaches, the light will be hidden, and, from the extreme\r\nnarrowness of the bridge and likewise becoming entangled in the thorns,\r\nhe will fall headlong into the abyss of fire that is beneath. This is\r\nthe fragment of our old Aryan mythology which the Mohammedan has taken\r\nto himself to form an image of hell and of punishment after death. It is\r\nsignificant that from the Persians should have been inherited the most\r\ngloomy myth concerning the Bridge of Souls. For from the same source we\r\n(Christians) gain our fearfullest notions of the Devil.\r\n\r\nThe bridge cannot be always the Milky-way. In at least one Sanskrit hymn\r\nwe learn--\r\n\r\n\"Upon it, they say, there are colours, white, and blue, and brown, and\r\ngold, and red.\r\n\r\n\"And this path Brahma knows, and he who has known Brahma shall take it;\r\nhe who is pure and glorious.\"\r\n\r\nHere the singer is evidently describing the rainbow. Now in the Norse\r\ncosmology the rainbow had the same name as the Indian _patha-devayano_,\r\ngods'-path. The Eddas call it As-bru, the bridge of the Æsir, or gods.\r\nIts other name, Bifröst, the trembling mile, it may even have inherited\r\nfrom the Milky-way, for that, when we look at it, seems to be always\r\ntrembling. Asbru or Bifröst, then, is the bridge whereby the gods\r\ndescend to earth. One end of it reaches to the famous Urdar fount, where\r\nsit the weird sisters three--the Nornir, or fates. \"Near the fountain\r\nwhich is under the ash stands a very fair house, out of which come\r\nthree maidens, named Urd, Verdandi, and Skuld (Past, Present, Future).\r\nThese maidens assign the lifetime of men, and are called Norns.\"[35] To\r\ntheir stream the gods ride every day along Bifröst to take counsel. For\r\nin the Norse creed the gods know not the hidden things of the future,\r\nnor have power to ward them off. Fate and death, the Twilight of the\r\nGods, lies ahead for them also, as these things lie ahead of mortals.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that a trace of the rainbow bridge is to be seen in the\r\nGreek myth of the asphodel meadows, which are a part of the infernal\r\nregions. But no other trace of the Bridge of Souls--if this be one--is\r\nto be found throughout the range of Hellenic mythology.\r\n\r\nThe Eddas have nothing to say of the Milky-way. But we have clear\r\nevidence that it was considered by the German people a path for the\r\ndead. Indeed, in the scanty legends which survive, we can trace the\r\ncharacteristic features of the Indian myth of the bridge guarded by\r\nYama's dogs, and the souls led along it by the wind-god. The wind-god of\r\nthe north is the father of gods, none less than Odin himself; and this\r\nis why Odin is described as riding with his Valkyriur to the\r\nbattle-fields, to choose from the dead the heroes who shall go with him\r\nto Valhöll, the hall of the chosen. It is because, as the wind-god, he\r\ncollects the breath of the departed. Odin and Freyja (Air and Earth)\r\ndivide the slain, says one legend--that is, the bodies go to earth, the\r\nbreath goes to heaven. Now, in the Middle Ages, when Odin-worship had\r\nbeen overthrown, the gods of Asgaard descended to Helheim; from being\r\ndeities they were turned into fiends. Odin still pursued his office as\r\nleader of the souls; but now he was huntsman of hell. One of the\r\ncommonest appearances of this fiend, therefore, is as a huntsman--called\r\nthe Wild Huntsman. He is heard by the peasants of the wild mountain\r\ndistricts at this day. He is companioned by _two dogs_, and his chase\r\ngoes on along the Milky-way all the year through, save during the twelve\r\nnights which follow Christmas. During that time he hunts on earth, and\r\nthe peasant will do well to keep his door well-barred at night. If he\r\ndoes not, one of the hell-hounds will rush in and lie down in the ashes\r\nof the hearth. No power will move him during the ensuing year, and for\r\nall that time there will be trouble in the house. When the hunt comes\r\nround again he will rise from his couch and rush forth, wildly howling,\r\nto join his master.\r\n\r\nA gentler legend is that which we find preserved in a charming poem of\r\nthe Swede, Torpelius, called \"The Winter Street\"--another of the names\r\nfor the Milky-way. With this, in the form in which it has been rendered\r\ninto English,[36] we may end our list of legends connected with the Sea\r\nof Death or the Bridge of Souls. The story is of two lovers:--\r\n\r\n          \"Her name Salami was, his Zulamyth;\r\n    And each so loved, each other loved. Thus runs the tender myth:\r\n\r\n    \"That once on earth they lived, and, loving there,\r\n    Were wrenched apart by night, and sorrow, and despair;\r\n    And when death came at last, with white wings given,\r\n    Condemned to live apart, each reached a separate heaven.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Yet loving still upon the azure height,\r\n    Across unmeasured ways of splendour, gleaming bright,\r\n    With worlds on worlds that spread and glowed and burned,\r\n    Each unto each, with love that knew no limit, longing turned.\r\n\r\n    \"Zulamyth half consumed, until he willed\r\n    Out of his strength one night a bridge of light to build\r\n    Across the waste--and lo! from her far sun,\r\n    A bridge of light from orb to orb Salami had begun.\r\n\r\n    \"A thousand years they built, still on, with faith,\r\n    Immeasurable, quenchless, so my legend saith,\r\n    Until the winter street of light--a bridge\r\n    Above heaven's highest vault swung clear, remotest ridge from\r\n      ridge.\r\n\r\n    \"Fear seized the Cherubim; to God they spake--\r\n    'See what amongst thy works, Almighty, these can make!'\r\n    God smiled, and smiling, lit the spheres with joy--\r\n    'What in my world love builds,' he said, 'shall I, shall Love\r\n      itself destroy?'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    C.

Keary: _Evening Hours_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. MACVEY NAPIER AND THE EDINBURGH REVIEWERS.\r\n\r\n    _Selection from the Correspondence of the late Macvey Napier, Esq._\r\n    Edited by his son, MACVEY NAPIER. London: Macmillan & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Macvey Napier, who succeeded Francis Jeffrey in the editorship of\r\nthe great Whig Review, had, of course, a perfect right to preserve the\r\nletters which are published in this volume, and to study them in private\r\nas much as he pleased. Indeed, for anything that appears to the contrary\r\nin the \"Introduction\" by his son, the present Mr. Macvey Napier, they\r\nmay have been bequeathed by the original recipient with instructions\r\nthat they should some day be published. An edition, privately circulated\r\na short time ago, led to \"representations that a correspondence of so\r\nmuch interest ought to be made more accessible,\" and the present volume\r\nis the result; but it might be maintained that the writers of such\r\nletters would, if they could have been consulted, have objected to their\r\npublication; and that to send them forth to the world in all their\r\nnakedness was, at all events, not a delicate or magnanimous thing to do.\r\n\"Much might be said on both sides.\" Paley, in his chapter on the\r\noriginal character of the Christian Morality, remarked that though a\r\nthousand cases might be supposed in which the use of the golden rule\r\nmight mislead a person, it was impossible in fact to light on such a\r\ncase. That was a hazardous observation, for the truth is that when we\r\nonce get beyond elementary conditions of being and doing, we find human\r\nbeings differ so very widely, and in such utterly incalculable ways,\r\nthat it is in vain to poll the monitor in the breast on questions that\r\ndo in fact arise daily--five hundred in a thousand will vote one way,\r\nand five hundred in another. \"How would you like it yourself?\" is a\r\nquestion that elicits the most discordant replies. I have a very\r\npositive feeling that I should have left many of these letters in the\r\nportfolio, or put them into the fire; but when I look about me for a\r\nstandard which I could take in my hand to Mr. Napier, I am baffled--he\r\nmight produce one of his own that would silence me on the spot. And\r\nwhen one has taken up a book to comment upon it with as little reserve\r\nas may be, it seems idle, if not Irish, to begin by saying that the most\r\namusing or most fertile things in it ought never to have seen the light.\r\n\r\nThis point may recur before we have done; and in the meantime it should\r\nbe remarked that nothing very momentous, either to the honour or the\r\ndisgrace of human nature in general, or literary human nature in\r\nparticular, can be extracted from this correspondence. A late essayist\r\nused to tell a true anecdote of a distinguished statesman who had lived\r\nmany years and seen as many changes as Ulysses. A friend asked him\r\nsomething like this: \"Well, now, you have had a great deal to do with\r\nmankind, and you have outlived the heats and prejudices of youth; what\r\ndo you think of men in general?\" And the veteran replied: \"Oh, I like\r\nthem--very good fellows; but\"--and here we shall mollify his language a\r\nlittle--\"but condemnably vain, you know.\" And really that is about the\r\nworst thing you can find it in your heart to say of literary men after\r\nrunning through these letters--\"very good fellows, but very vain, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nAnother point which lies less near the surface, and has at least the\r\nlook of novelty, would perhaps be this. It is the most frequent and most\r\nvoluminous of the writers who unconsciously tell us the most about\r\nthemselves; and who, with the pleasing exception of Jeffrey, show us the\r\nmost of their unamiable sides. But there is comfort for impulsive people\r\nin the fact that it is not always the most self-controlled and\r\ninoffensive of the writers who win upon us. The Brougham-Macaulay feud\r\nruns sprawling through these pages till we are tired of it; and some of\r\npoor Brougham's letters are downright venomous. But the total absence of\r\ndisguise and the blundering boyish inconsistency disarm us. Taking the\r\nletters one by one, the moral superiority is with Macaulay on Brougham\r\nas against Brougham on Macaulay, but taking the correspondence in the\r\nlump, it is something like Charles Surface against Joseph Surface, in\r\nanother line--only, of course, there is no hypocrisy. While you come to\r\nfeel for Brougham in his spluttering rages, you feel also that Macaulay,\r\nin his too-admirable self-continence, can do very well without your\r\ncompassion, whatever he may have to complain of. It is easy to discern\r\nthat Brougham honestly believed in his own superiority to the young\r\nrival who outshone him, and yet that he was inwardly tormented.\r\nMacaulay's forbearance was of the kind _qui coûte si peu au gens\r\nheureux_. The editor, Mr. Napier, was, we may conjecture, the greatest\r\nsufferer of the three. Much was owed to Brougham as a man of enormous\r\nintellectual force; to which, apart from his past services, great\r\nrespect was due: but Macaulay was by far the best writer, and (to employ\r\na bull which is common enough) incomparably the most attractive\r\ncontributor. The strength of his hold upon the Review and its editor is\r\napparent on every tenth page of the book, and comes out forcibly enough\r\nin a letter from Sir James Stephen to Mr. Napier. Mr. Napier had\r\nwritten to Sir James, expressing some delicate surprise that no article\r\nfrom his pen had reached the Review for a long time. Sir James excuses\r\nhimself in this fashion:--\r\n\r\n    \"I know that many of your contributors must be importunate for a\r\n    place; that you must be fencing and compromising at a weary rate;\r\n    that there are many interests of the passing day which you could not\r\n    overlook; and that we should all have growled like so many fasting\r\n    bears if denied the regular return of the Macaulay diet, to which we\r\n    have been so long accustomed.\"\r\n\r\nSir James was an exceedingly busy man, and he was not professedly a man\r\nof letters like Macaulay; but we may, if we like, read between the lines\r\nin these excuses and find a little pique there, as well as a just sense\r\nof an editor's difficulties.\r\n\r\nAnother point which lies broadly and prominently upon the surface in\r\nthese letters is a very unpleasant one. It is scarcely credible how much\r\ndull conceit and sheer ignorant arbitrariness there often is in the\r\nminds of able and cultivated men. It does not seem even to occur to them\r\nthat their own range may be limited, and their judgments upon many (or\r\neven a few) topics not worth ink or breath. It should hardly be\r\noffensive to an ordinary man to be told, or at least to find it tacitly\r\nassumed, that he could not have invented fluxions, painted like\r\nRembrandt, or sung like Pindar. Why, then, should it be difficult for\r\nany cultivated specialist, of more than ordinary faculties, to make the\r\nreflection that he must be deficient in some direction or other? Yet we\r\nfind in practice that it is not only difficult, but impossible, in the\r\nmajority of cases. Mr. Napier seems to have invited, or at all events\r\nnot to have repelled, free criticisms on his Review from the\r\ncontributors in general, and the outcome is little short of appalling.\r\nIf ever there was an able man it was Mr. Senior, yet these are the terms\r\nin which he allows himself to speak of an article on Christopher\r\nNorth--or rather of Christopher North himself:--\"The article on\r\nChristopher North is my abomination. I think him one of the very worst\r\nof the clever bad writers who infest modern literature; full of bombast,\r\naffectation, conceit, in short, of all the _vitia_, _tristia_, as well\r\nas _dulcia_. I had almost as soon try to read Carlyle or Coleridge.\" Now\r\nMr. Senior was, of course, entitled to dislike Christopher North, and\r\nthere is plenty to be said against him in the way of criticism; but the\r\ncharge of \"affectation\" is foolish, and the whole passage pitched in the\r\nmost detestable of all literary key-notes. John Wilson was a man of\r\ngenius, whose personal likings and rampant animal spirits led him most\r\nmournfully astray. He was wanting also in love of truth for its own\r\nsake; but he was as much superior to Mr. Senior as Shakspeare was to\r\n_him_. And the addition about Carlyle or Coleridge--_or_ Coleridge!--is\r\njust the gratuitous insolence of one-eyed dulness. There is enough and\r\nto spare of blame ready in any balanced mind for either of these great\r\nwriters, but they can do without the admiration of wooden-headed prigs,\r\nhowever able. The point, however, is that it never dawns upon the mind\r\nof even so clever and cultivated a man as Mr. Senior, that his head may\r\nhave gaps in it.\r\n\r\nAnother instance to the same purport may be selected from a letter from\r\nMr. Edwin Atherstone, the poet--for it would perhaps be hard and\r\ngrudging to deny him the title, since he found an audience, and I have a\r\nvague recollection of having once read verses of his about Nineveh or\r\nBabylon which had in them power of the picturesque-meditative order.\r\nNow, this is the way in which Mr. Edwin Atherstone speaks of Dr. Thomas\r\nBrown, the metaphysician:--\"For myself, I know not a writer, with the\r\nexception of Shakspeare, Milton, Homer, and Scott, from whom I have\r\nderived such high delight as from Dr. Brown.\"\r\n\r\nWas ever such a category put on paper before? It is as if a man should\r\nsay his favourite musical instruments were the organ, the harp, the\r\ntrumpet, the violin, and the sewing-machine. Brown was one of the most\r\nreadable of metaphysicians; he made some acute hits, and he wrote\r\nelegant verses; but his position in Mr. Atherstone's list is as\r\ninexplicably quaint as that of \"Burke, commonly called the Sublime,\" in\r\nthe epitaph on the lady who \"painted in water-colours,\" and \"was first\r\ncousin to Lady Jones.\"\r\n\r\nThe worst examples of all, however, come from the letters of Francis\r\nJeffrey himself. Jeffrey has been underrated, and he was a most amiable\r\nman; but some of the verdicts he thought fit to pronounce upon articles\r\nin the _Edinburgh_, when edited by Mr. Napier, are _saugrenus_. In one\r\ncase he is about suggesting a contributor, to deal with a certain topic,\r\nand is so polite as to say that the name of Mr. John Stuart Mill had\r\nstruck him:--\"I once thought of John Mill, but there are reasons against\r\nhim too, independent of his great unreadable book and its elaborate\r\ndemonstrations of axioms and truisms.\"\r\n\r\nThere might be weighty \"reasons against\" Mr. Mill, but what his \"Logic\"\r\ncould have to do with the question is not clear. It never seems to have\r\ncrossed Jeffrey's mind that he _might_ be totally disqualified for\r\nforming an opinion of a book like that; and, having called it\r\n\"unreadable\" (though to a reader with any natural bent towards such\r\nmatters it is deeply interesting), he actually puts forward the fact\r\nthat Mill had written it as a reason against his being entrusted with\r\nthe treatment of a political topic in a Whig Review. Editors are human,\r\nand the editorial position is a very troublesome one. An editor may lose\r\nhis head, as an overworked wine-taster may lose his palate. In a word,\r\nallowances must be made; but, after a disclosure or two like this, it is\r\ndifficult not to conclude that the Review owed no more of its success to\r\nits former editor than it might have owed to any intelligent clerk. But\r\nwe cannot let Jeffrey go yet. The following passage relates to an\r\narticle on Victor Cousin:--\r\n\r\n    \"Cousin I pronounce beyond all doubt the most unreadable thing that\r\n    ever appeared in the _Review_. The only chance is, that gentle\r\n    readers may take it to be very profound, and conclude that the\r\n    fault is in their want of understanding. But I am not disposed to\r\n    agree with them. It is ten times more _mystical_ than anything my\r\n    friend Carlyle ever wrote, and not half so agreeably written. It is\r\n    nothing to the purpose that he does not agree with the worst part of\r\n    the mysticism, for he affects to understand it, and to explain it,\r\n    and to think it very ingenious and respectable, and it is mere\r\n    gibberish. He may possibly be a clever man. There are even\r\n    indications of that in his paper, but he is not a _very_ clever man,\r\n    nor of much power; and beyond all question he is not a good writer\r\n    on such subjects. If you ever admit such a disquisition again, order\r\n    your operator to instance and illustrate all his propositions by\r\n    cases or examples, and to reason and explain with reference to\r\n    these. This is a sure test of sheer nonsense, and moreover an\r\n    infinite resource for the explication of obscure truth, if there be\r\n    any such thing.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the writer of the article in question was Sir William Hamilton. \"He\r\nmay possibly be a clever man, but beyond all question he is not a good\r\nwriter on such subjects.\" So much for Jeffrey.\r\n\r\n    \"Nec sibi coenarum quivis temere arroget artem,\r\n    Non prius exacta tenui ratione saporum.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Mr. Carlyle is again dragged in, and Sir William is pronounced \"ten\r\ntimes more _mystical_\" than he--\"mystical\" in italics. When a writer,\r\nusing the word mystical opprobriously, prints it in italics, it is\r\nusually safe to decide that he knows nothing of metaphysics. The\r\nconcluding sentences are instructive examples of editorial\r\nself-confidence: \"If ever you admit such a disquisition again, _order\r\nyour operator to_\" do so-and-so. Thus, the treatment of Mill and\r\nHamilton being equally ignorant and inept, there is no escape for the\r\nex-editor. Both verdicts were after the too-celebrated\r\n\"this-will-never-do\" manner, and that is all.\r\n\r\nIn the communications from literary men there are some fine instances of\r\njust self-consciousness. Tom Campbell writes, with great warmth and\r\nalertness, to promise an article upon a new work about the Nerves; but\r\nshortly afterwards writes again, candidly confessing that he had found,\r\nupon looking again at the work, that his aptitude for scientific detail\r\nwas not great enough to enable him to do justice to the subject. A\r\nletter from William Hazlitt is so striking, both for its truthfulness\r\nand its clear-headedness, as to deserve quoting in full. He had been\r\nwritten to by Mr. Napier for some contributions to the _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_, and he replies, from his well-known retreat at Winterslow\r\nHut, in these terms:--\r\n\r\n    \"I am sorry to be obliged, from want of health and a number of other\r\n    engagements, which I am little able to perform, to decline the\r\n    flattering offer you make me. I am also afraid that I should not be\r\n    able to do the article in question, or yourself, justice, for I am\r\n    not only without books, but without knowledge of what books are\r\n    necessary to be consulted on the subject. To get up an article in a\r\n    Review on any subject of general literature is quite as much as I\r\n    can do without exposing myself. The object of an Encyclopædia is, I\r\n    take it, to condense and combine all the facts relating to a\r\n    subject, and all the theories of any consequence already known or\r\n    advanced. Now, where the business of such a work ends, is just where\r\n    I begin--that is, I might perhaps throw in an idle speculation or\r\n    two of my own, not contained in former accounts of the subject, and\r\n    which would have very little pretensions to rank as scientific. I\r\n    know something about Congreve, but nothing at all of Aristophanes,\r\n    and yet I conceive that the writer of an article on the Drama ought\r\n    to be as well acquainted with the one as the other.\"\r\n\r\nThe honesty of this is quite refreshing. There is one more letter, of a\r\nsimilar order, which deserves to be signalized. In August, 1843,\r\nMacaulay, being pressed for more frequent contributions, writes from the\r\nAlbany that he can promise, at the very utmost, no more than two\r\narticles in a year:--\r\n\r\n    \"I ought to give my whole leisure to my History; and I fear that if\r\n    I suffer myself to be diverted from that design as I have done, I\r\n    shall, like poor Mackintosh, leave behind me the character of a man\r\n    who would have done something if he had concentrated his powers\r\n    instead of frittering them away. There are people who can carry on\r\n    twenty works at a time. Southey would write the history of Brazil\r\n    before breakfast, an ode after breakfast, then the history of the\r\n    Peninsular War till dinner, and an article for the _Quarterly\r\n    Review_ in the evening. But I am of a different temper. I never\r\n    write so as to please myself until my subject has for the time\r\n    driven away every other out of my head. When I turn from one work to\r\n    another a great deal of time is lost in the mere transition. I must\r\n    not go on dawdling and reproaching myself all my life.\"\r\n\r\nThere is something melancholy in this, admirable as it is. Macaulay had\r\nbegun to watch the shadow on the dial too closely to permit him to do\r\nmuch miscellaneous work with an easy mind. There is an important lesson\r\nfor men of letters in the sentence,--\"When I turn from one work to\r\nanother, a great deal of time is lost in the mere transition.\" Here lies\r\nthe great difference between serious literary work and that of ordinary\r\nbusiness, where the mind is solicited by one thing after another in\r\nrapid succession. In the first case, time and energy have to be expended\r\nin evolving from within a fresh impulse for every topic. The most\r\nreadable writings of Southey are those which he produced fragment by\r\nfragment, on topics for which little renewal of impulse was required. To\r\nwrite a great poem in scraps, all by the clock, was a task which only a\r\nvery conceited and rather wooden man would have attempted; and the\r\nresult we know, though there are fine things in Southey's longer poems.\r\nA powerful passage by Cardinal Newman on the difficulties of literary\r\nwork is almost too well known to bear quoting, but a living poet, Mrs.\r\nAugusta Webster, has put the case so fairly that Macaulay's shade--which\r\nis, of course, a shade that reads everything--may be gratified by seeing\r\nin a handy way a few of her sentences:--\r\n\r\n    \"Occupations of study, scientific research, literary production--of\r\n    brain-work of any kind that is carried on in the worker's private\r\n    home with no visible reminder of customer or client--are taken to be\r\n    such as can lightly be done at one time as well as another, and\r\n    resumed after no matter what interruptions, like a lady's\r\n    embroidery, which she can take up again at the very stitch she left\r\n    her needle in. Professions of this sort not only admit, but in many\r\n    instances require, considerable variation in the amount of daily\r\n    time directly bestowed on them,--_directly_, for the true student is\r\n    not at his work only when he is ostensibly employed, but whenever\r\n    and wherever he may have his head to himself,--and there is no\r\n    measure of visible quantity for the more or less results of\r\n    application.... The literary man probably fares the worst of all. He\r\n    is not merely not protected by the manual part of his processes, but\r\n    it is his danger. It is so easy--what anybody can do at any time!...\r\n    Of course the simple fact is that it is more difficult for this\r\n    class of persons to practise their vocations under the drawback of\r\n    perpetual breaks, actual and (what comes to nearly the same thing)\r\n    expected, than it is for 'business men.' Let the attention of the\r\n    solicitor, for instance, busied on the points of an intricate case,\r\n    be perforce diverted to another matter, there is lost from that case\r\n    just the time diverted, and a little extra to allow for the mind\r\n    which returns to any interrupted course of thought, never returning\r\n    to it exactly at the point at which it was forced to leave it. But\r\n    there are the recorded facts; the direct conclusions to be drawn\r\n    remain unaltered; nothing has disappeared, nothing has lost its\r\n    identity. But suppose, let us say, a dramatist, devising his crisis\r\n    after hours, perhaps days, of gradual growth, to the moment when he\r\n    sees it before him as a reality.... Force his attention away, and he\r\n    has lost, not merely the time he needed to complete a spell of\r\n    works, with something over for the difficulty of resuming, but the\r\n    _power_ of resuming. All has faded into a haze; and the fruit of\r\n    days, may be, has been thrown away at the ripening, for such moments\r\n    do not come twice.\"\r\n\r\nThere are but few of Mr. Napier's own letters in this volume, so that we\r\nhave only indirect means of measuring his idea of his editorial rights\r\nor duties as against contributors. There is one case in which Macaulay\r\ncomplains strongly of certain excisions, and there is another in which\r\nhe defends certain phrases of his own which appear to have offended the\r\ntaste of Mr. Napier, who found them undignified, if not slightly vulgar.\r\nHe submits of course--all the mutilated ones submit--and he says he\r\nsubmits \"willingly;\" but all the while we can too plainly see the wry\r\nfaces he is making. Mr. Napier was, apparently, a purist in the matter\r\nof style; but there is something almost grotesque in the spectacle of a\r\nman of his quality correcting Macaulay. It reminds one of _cet imbécile\r\nBuloz_.[37] The case of Leigh Hunt was very different, for he sometimes\r\nwent to the extreme verge of decorum--quarterly review decorum, that\r\nis--and beyond it. But we may safely conclude that Macaulay knew much\r\nbetter than his editor how to turn a sentence, or when the use of a\r\nFrench locution was desirable for ends of literary effect. Upon this\r\nsubject of imported phrases Mr. Napier was, it seems, very punctilious,\r\nfor with Mr. G. H. Lewes he must have had a brisk correspondence about\r\nit. Mr. Lewes, who was then a young writer, anxious to get his feet well\r\nplanted, submits, with every possible expression of acquiescence, one\r\nmight almost say, of abject agreement; but it is easy to see that his\r\ncompliance was forced. Macaulay in his discussion of this little matter\r\nwith Napier, easily and decisively lays down the true guiding\r\nprinciple:--\"The first rule of all writing,--that rule to which every\r\nother rule is subordinate,--is that the words used by the writer shall\r\nbe such as most fully and precisely convey his meaning to the great body\r\nof his readers. All considerations about the purity and dignity of style\r\nought to bend to this consideration.\"\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, exhausts the subject; and leaves the editor only one\r\nquestion to solve--namely, whether the writer whom he employs has\r\npresumably a meaning fit to be conveyed to the readers of his\r\nperiodical. Upon that point he must use his own judgment; but it was\r\nidle for a man like Mr. Napier to criticize the phrasing of a man like\r\nMacaulay, who had ten thousand times his reading. For it is upon the\r\n\"reading\" that the matter very largely turns. The force of a quotation\r\nor a phrase imported from a foreign tongue depends, not upon the bare\r\nmeaning of the words, but upon the suggestiveness of certain\r\nassociations. This does not necessarily imply that the precise context\r\nis recalled, or certain hackneyed trifles from Lucretius and Horace, and\r\na score of such chips in porridge, would be indecent. If it be said that\r\nall this implies that an editor should be omniscient, or at lowest an\r\nomnivorous reader, the reply is, that it certainly does--unless the\r\nprinciple adopted in the conduct of the periodical be the more recent\r\none of choosing contributors largely on account of their names, and then\r\nleaving them to answer for their own sins, if any. One thing is clear,\r\nthat if a man like Jeffrey--or like Napier--could be shown the number of\r\nblunders he made in mutilating the writings of his contributors, he\r\nwould feel very much humiliated. Thackeray complains very bitterly of\r\nthe suppression of some of his touches of humour, and his sufferings at\r\nthe hands of a critic like Mr. Napier (able man as he was) must have\r\nbeen terrible indeed.\r\n\r\nThe system recently adopted of having every article signed, has not\r\nyielded the results which were predicted or expected by those who so\r\nlong struggled to get it introduced. It has led to \"starring\" more\r\noutrageous and more audacious than any that was ever seen upon the\r\nstage, and to mischief far more serious. The worst of these is the\r\nsubstitution of a spurious sort of authority for the natural influence\r\nor weight of the writing, even upon some of the most important topics\r\nwhich can engage the human mind. The opinion, for example, of a\r\nversatile politician, or traveller, or physicist, on a question of\r\nreligion or morals may be of no more value than that of the first man\r\nyou meet on passing into the streets. But it will attract attention in\r\nproportion to the notoriety of the author, and though wise men may know\r\nthat it is weak or foolish, they may wait a long while for the chance of\r\nsaying so from any pulpit worth preaching in, because the platforms are\r\npre-engaged; and also because, the \"organs of opinion\" being bound to\r\nlive by keeping up a succession of attractive names in their pages, it\r\nwill not do to offend the owners of such names. One other result of the\r\nrecent system (not everywhere and always, of course, but generally and\r\nmost frequently) is a want of freshness in periodical literature. This\r\nevil our American friends manage to escape; only they are much bolder\r\nthan we are, and do not stand in terror of the charge of levity. But, as\r\na rule, writers who are fit for starring purposes lose freshness in a\r\nvery short time; and then they do a still farther mischief by striking\r\nthat key-note of second-hand thought which is so prevalent, or at least\r\nso common in even our better literature.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing enough to recall the superstition of secrecy which\r\ninspired the policy of the first Edinburgh Reviewers. Lord Jeffrey has\r\ntold us how the conspirators, Brougham, Sydney Smith, Horner, and\r\nhimself, used to meet by night in the back room of a printing-office,\r\nand steal to their work by winding paths and back stairs, like\r\nassassins. This was folly, though not inexcusably without rational\r\nground or motive, and one cannot resist the belief that the more modern\r\nplan will work well some day, if it does not now. But the difference in\r\nthe results is not so great as might have been hoped for. Men of letters\r\ndo not now openly insult each other for differences of opinion in\r\npolitics or theology; but it is not any variation of mechanism which has\r\nmade the change, and, though less brutality of phrasing is now\r\npermitted, it would be difficult to surpass in bitterness or unfairness\r\nsome of the signed and accredited criticism of our own day. On the\r\nwhole, it comes to this,--you can get no more out of given moral\r\nconditions than there is in them. If public writers are clique-ish (a\r\nword to disturb Mr. Napier in his grave, and certainly an ugly one) and\r\nunjust to each other, it is because you cannot change the spots of the\r\nleopard. A man who loves the truth will employ his pen conscientiously\r\nand kindly, whether he writes anonymously or otherwise. To this it may\r\nbe added that there is something extremely quaint in one thing that we\r\nmay see taking place every week--the greater part of our newspaper\r\nwriting is still unsigned, and, considering what a hastily got-up\r\nmiscellany a newspaper necessarily is, it can hardly be otherwise. A\r\ncolumn of reviews in a newspaper is sometimes the work of as many hands\r\nas there are books reviewed in it. But it might certainly have been\r\nexpected beforehand that reviewers who write without signature should be\r\nboth careful and moderate in attacking writers who sign, and who,\r\npresumably, take more time over their work than contributors to\r\nnewspapers can generally do. Yet the newspaper columns in which\r\nquarterly and monthly periodicals are reviewed are \"too often\" (we must\r\nround the corner with the help of that commonplace) models of flippancy\r\nand dogmatism.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it is not from any mechanical changes of method that we\r\nmust expect improvement in Review literature. Of course, in largeness,\r\nfulness, richness, and versatility the Review-writing of to-day is\r\nimmeasurably superior to that of the days when Macaulay and Brougham\r\nfought for precedence in the _Edinburgh_. But so is the literature\r\nreviewed--one is a big \"rolling miscellany,\" and so is the other. It\r\ndoes not seem to some of us that, _other things being made equal_, the\r\nliterature of our modern Reviews (using the word widely) is either\r\nsuperior or inferior to that of the _Edinburgh_, for example. The\r\ngrowth, however, of literature generally in force, colour, range, and\r\neffectiveness, is something astounding. We note this, or rather it\r\noverwhelms us, in turning over such a book as the Memoirs of Harriet\r\nMartineau; and there is more than the insolence of new-fangled tastes in\r\nputting such a question as--where would Campbell's \"Pleasures of Hope\"\r\nbe if it were published to-morrow? One day when Brougham had just left\r\n(for London) a country-house where he had been staying, Rogers, who was\r\na fellow-guest with him, made some such remark as this--\"In that\r\npost-chaise went away this morning, Bacon, Newton, Demosthenes, and\r\nSolon.\" It is not recorded that Rogers meant this as a joke; but where\r\nwould Brougham be after a little manipulation by Mr. Jevons or Mr.\r\nGoldwin Smith? It would be tiresome to dwell upon this, and wrong to\r\nsuggest that the men were smaller because the outlook was less; but this\r\nview, if anything, helps us to see the direction in which one of our\r\nbest hopes for literature must lie--namely, in its ever-increasing\r\nvolume. There will always be hostile camps, and there will always be\r\nwarriors of low _morale_, but as each camp enlarges, the _average_ pain\r\nof those who suffer from injustice or neglect will be lessened. And this\r\nobservation is by no means addressed to mere questions of reviewing in\r\nthe minor sense, but rather to literature in the mass as representing\r\nthe culture of the time.\r\n\r\nSince the time when Jeffrey ruled the _Edinburgh Review_, and even since\r\nthe death of Mr. Napier, \"the advertising element,\" and commercial\r\nelements in general, have played a great and new part, an increasing\r\npart, too, in the fortunes, and thus in regulating the quality and\r\ntendency, of current literature. One result of this state of things is\r\nan ever-increasing tendency to compromise in the expression of opinion.\r\nIn spite of the spirit of tolerance of which we hear so much, there was\r\nperhaps never a time in which the expression of opinion was so much\r\nemasculated in the higher periodical literature, or in which so much\r\ntrickery of accommodated phraseology was going forward. This will last\r\nfor a long time yet--as long as periodical literature is a matter of\r\ncommercial speculation. It is an evil omen that the greatest amount of\r\nfreedom now displayed is in political and scientific discussion. It is\r\ndifficult to see where the remedy is to come from in discussions of\r\nanother kind. Probably we shall have a lesson by the cataclysmic method\r\nbefore very long. There is in this volume a letter from Brougham to\r\nNapier, in which Brougham is very angry about an indirect disclosure of\r\nRomilly's heterodoxy, and he goes off at a tangent to express a doubt\r\nwhether Macaulay was any better than Romilly, but is very anxious that\r\nconventional conformity should be strictly maintained in the Review,\r\neven to the length of concealing from the general reader as far as\r\npossible such facts as that a man so good and \"religious\" as Romilly\r\ncould be a disbeliever in this, that, or the other. We have now got\r\nbeyond that; the accredited policy is in a vague way to trump the cards\r\nof the dangerous people, and then nobody shows his hand fairly and\r\nfreely. Meanwhile, everybody feels uneasy, from a latent sense of\r\ninsincerity; and, when once the excitement is off, the natural\r\nperception that out of nothing nothing can come, reassumes its sway.\r\nThe game cannot go on in this way for ever, though no one can foresee by\r\nwhat accident the lights will be blown out, the tables thrown over, and\r\nthe stakes roughly dealt with at last.\r\n\r\nA great difference, as might be expected, arises from the incredible\r\nwidening of what might be called the constituencies of opinion.\r\nPolitical articles of the \"inspired\" order do not count as they did, or\r\nwere supposed to do, in the days of \"Coningsby\" even, much less as they\r\ndid a decade or two sooner. The effective currents of thought are far\r\ntoo numerous and far too massive to be guided--nay, too numerous and too\r\nmassive for even the most conceited of propagandists or prophets to\r\nfancy he could calculate them. What sort of figure as a publicist or\r\n\"inspired\" political writer would a man like Croker cut at this end of\r\nthe century? It must have been a dolorous day for such as he when they\r\nfirst felt sure the tides were coming up which were to sweep them and\r\ntheir works into oblivion, or at least into limbo, and make successors\r\nto their function impossible in future. We do not affirm that the\r\npresent phase of change is for the best; no theory of progress will\r\njustify statements of that kind. In fact, things are quite bad enough;\r\nbut some security against certain evils there must be, in the fact that\r\nthese are days in which it is difficult to hide a wrong, or an error,\r\nwhich has an immediate sinister bearing upon ends cherished by any\r\nschool of opinion. Who on earth would now think of calling the _Times_\r\nthe Thunderer? Just when middle-aged men of to-day were babies it was\r\nthought finely argumentative, if not conclusive, to call the London\r\nUniversity \"Stinkomalee\"--in the interest of Church and King; but the\r\n\"hard hitting\" of our own time is done in other fashion. Even if the\r\nMarquis of Salisbury were to edit a paper he would not be able to make\r\nmuch out of Titus Oates. But the allusion to that episode in another\r\nsphere of action may remind us of the late Lord Derby, who might almost\r\nbe called the last of the old school of politicians. The mere mention of\r\nhis name seems to flash light upon the gulf we have traversed since the\r\ndays when the world was divided between a Whig organ and a Tory organ.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the incalculable increase of devotion to science, we\r\nhave had an increase of devotion to ends held to be practical, and this\r\nhas largely governed our literature. The subject now barely hinted at is\r\nwell worth extended treatment. It is, however, no more than the truth\r\nthat there has been recently a great diminution of speculative\r\nenthusiasm of all kinds, with a largely increased tendency to make\r\nthings pleasant for all parties. Convenience, in fact, becomes more and\r\nmore the governing factor of life; this tells upon our better\r\nliterature; and until the wind sets again from the old quarters--as it\r\ncertainly will some day--we shall feel the want of certain elements of\r\nfreshness, individuality, and moral impulse which touch us more closely\r\nthan we at first recognize in reading the old Edinburgh Reviewers.\r\n\r\n    MATTHEW BROWNE.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] One, at least, of the contributors whom Buloz tortured (Georges\r\nSand wrote that she wished him \"_au diable_\" ten times a day, only he\r\nheld her purse-strings) used to date his letters in this style:--\"_A\r\nvingt-cinq lieues de cet imbécile Buloz._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUPREME GOD IN THE INDO-EUROPEAN MYTHOLOGY.\r\n\r\nComparative Mythology.[38]\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the last century the men of letters of Europe were\r\nastonished to hear that in Asia, on the banks of the Ganges, a more\r\nancient and richer language had been found than that of Homer. It\r\noffered in its words and forms striking analogies with the languages of\r\nRome and Athens. Interest once roused, systematic comparisons were made,\r\nand comparative grammar was founded. The sphere of comparisons widened\r\nand the group of Aryan languages was established.\r\n\r\nIt was thus ascertained that the languages of the Romans, of the Greeks,\r\nof the Gauls, of the Germans, of the Lithuanians, and of the Slavs in\r\nEurope, of the Hindoos and Persians in Asia, are made out of the same\r\nmaterials and cast in the same mould; that they are only varieties of\r\none primitive type. The precise laws which regulated the formation of\r\neach of these varieties were discovered, so that it is both possible to\r\nproceed from one of these languages to the other, and to trace all of\r\nthem to the original type whence they come, to the lost type which they\r\nreproduce. This lost type, the source of all the idioms of nearly the\r\nwhole of Europe and of a third of Asia, science has reconstructed: with\r\nan almost absolute certainty, it has described the grammar, drawn up the\r\nlexicon of that language, of which no direct echo remains, not the\r\nfragment of an inscription on a broken stone, of that language of which\r\nthe life and the death are pre-historic, and which was spoken at a\r\nperiod when there were as yet neither Romans, nor Hindoos, nor Greeks,\r\nnor Persians, nor Germans, nor Celts, and when the ancestors of all\r\nthose nations were still wandering as one tribe, one knows not where,\r\none knows not when.\r\n\r\nClosely following comparative grammar, almost at the same time rose up\r\ncomparative mythology, and with the ancient words awoke the gods that\r\nthey had sung, the beliefs that they had fostered. It was recognized\r\nthat if the Indo-Europeans spoke essentially the same language, they\r\nalso worshipped essentially the same gods and believed in the same\r\nthings. As comparative grammar, on hearing the sister-tongues, caught up\r\nthe echo of the mother, whose voice they repeat, so comparative\r\nmythology, in its turn, on looking at the sister religions, has tried to\r\nsee through them the original image which they reflect. As the one\r\nrestored the words and forms of the language which lived on the lips of\r\nthe Aryans at the moment of the breaking up of the Aryan unity, the\r\nother endeavoured to restore the gods and beliefs which lived in their\r\nsouls at the moment when, with the unity of the race, the identity of\r\nlanguage and belief passed away. This restoration of the pre-historic\r\ngods and of the pre-historic beliefs is the final object of comparative\r\nmythology, just as the reconstruction of words and forms is the final\r\nobject of comparative grammar. The object was analogous and so was the\r\nmethod. It is the comparative method, which by comparing kindred\r\ndivinities and kindred beliefs, finds the original divinity and the\r\noriginal belief which gave birth to them, and which are reproduced in\r\nthem. To sketch the picture of the original mythology, it is sufficient\r\nto separate from the various derivative mythologies the essential\r\ncharacteristics common to them. Every characteristic common to the\r\nsecondary religions will be legitimately referred to the primitive one,\r\nwhenever it is essential--that is to say neither borrowed from one of\r\nthe kindred religions nor due to an identical, but quite independent\r\ndevelopment. If, for instance, the various Indo-European mythologies\r\nagree in naming the gods _Daiva_, \"the shining ones,\" it follows that in\r\nthe primitive mythology, in the religion of the period of unity, they\r\nwere known already as beings of light and called thus. It is a great\r\ndeal easier to admit that the seven derived religions have faithfully\r\nrepeated what has been handed down to them from their common source,\r\nthan to imagine that once separated they have created the same\r\nconception, each one on its side, and have clothed it with the same\r\nexpression: the former hypothesis is a simple and natural induction: the\r\nsecond is in reality made up of seven hypotheses, and implies seven\r\nchances agreeing together, seven miracles.\r\n\r\nOur object in the following pages is to give a sketch of one of the\r\nchapters of the Aryan mythology. We try to show that the religion of the\r\nIndo-European unity recognized a Supreme God, and we try to find the\r\nmost ancient form and the earliest origin of that conception among the\r\nAryans, and to follow out the transformations it has undergone in the\r\ncourse of ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme God: Zeus, Jupiter, Varuna, Ahura Mazda.\r\n\r\nThe Aryan Gods are not organized as a Republic: they have a king. There\r\nis over the gods a Supreme God.\r\n\r\nFour of the Aryan mythologies have preserved a clear and precise notion\r\nof this conception: they are those of Greece, of Italy, of ancient\r\nIndia, and of ancient Persia. This Supreme God is called Zeus in Greece,\r\nJupiter in Italy, Varuna in ancient India, Ahura Mazda in ancient\r\nPersia. Let us then listen to Zeus, to Jupiter, to Varuna, and to Ahura\r\nMazda each in his turn.\r\n\r\n_Zeus and Jupiter._[39]--About three centuries before our era a Greek\r\npoet thus addressed Zeus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Oh! Thou most glorious of immortals, whose names are many, for ever\r\n    Almighty, Zeus, Thou who rulest nature, directing all things\r\n    according to a law, hail! To Thee all this universe moving round the\r\n    earth yields obedience, following whither thou leadest, and submits\r\n    itself to Thy rule.... So great in Thy nature, King Supreme above\r\n    all things, no work is achieved without Thee, neither on the earth,\r\n    nor in the celestial regions of ether, nor on the sea, but those\r\n    which the wicked accomplish in their folly.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the Zeus of the philosophers, of the Stoics, of Cleanthes: but\r\nhe was already the Zeus of the ancient poets. Powerful, omniscient, and\r\njust is the god of Æschylus, as that of Cleanthes: he is the king of\r\nkings, the blessed of the blessed, the sovereign power among all powers,\r\nthe only one who is free among the gods, who is the master of the\r\nmightiest, who is subservient to no one's rule; above whom no one sits,\r\nno one to whom from below he looks with awe; every word of his is\r\nabsolute; he is the God of deep thoughts, whose heart has dark and\r\nhidden ways, impenetrable to the eye, and no scheme formed within his\r\nmind has ever miscarried. Finally, he is the Father of Justice, Dike,\r\n\"the terrible virgin who breathes out on crime anger and death,\" it is\r\nhe who from hell raises vengeance with its slow chastisement against the\r\nbold wayward mortal. Terpander proclaims in Zeus the essence of all\r\nthings, the god who rules over everything. Archilochus sings Zeus\r\nfather, as the God who rules the heavens, who watches the guilty and\r\nunjust actions of men, who administers chastisements to monsters, the\r\nGod who created heaven and earth. The old man of Ascra knows that Zeus\r\nis the father of gods and of men, that his eye sees and comprehends all\r\nthings and reaches all that he wishes. In short, as far back as the\r\nGreek Pantheon appears in the light of history, even from Homer, Zeus\r\ntowers above the nation of gods which surrounds him. He himself\r\nproclaims, and the other gods proclaim after him, that, unrivalled in\r\npower and strength, he is the greatest of all; the gods, at his behest,\r\nsilently bow down before him; he would hurl into the gloomy depths of\r\nTartarus whomsoever should dare to disobey him: he would hurl him down\r\ninto the uttermost depths of the subterranean abyss: alone against them\r\nall, he would master them. Should they let fall from the sky a golden\r\nchain on which all the gods and goddesses might be suspended, they still\r\nwould be powerless, however hard they might strain to drag him from the\r\nheavens to the earth; and if it pleased him, he could draw them up even\r\nwith the earth, even with the sea, and he would then fix the chain on\r\nthe ridge of Olympus, and suspend on it the whole universe; so much is\r\nhe above mankind, above the gods. Not only is he the most powerful, but\r\nalso he is the wisest--the =mêtietês=; he is all wisdom and he is\r\nlikewise all justice. It is from him that the judges of the sons of the\r\nAchæans have received their laws: very good, very great, he holds\r\nlearned conversations with Themis (the law) who sits at his side;\r\nprayers are his daughters, whom he avenges for all the insults of the\r\nwicked.\r\n\r\nThus, power, wisdom, justice, belonged from all time to Zeus, to the\r\nZeus of Homer as well as to the Zeus of Cleanthes; to the Zeus of the\r\npoets as to him of the philosophers, in the remotest period of paganism\r\nas at the approach of the religion of Christ. A providential god rules\r\nthe Pantheon of the Hellenes.\r\n\r\nWhat Zeus is in Greece, Jupiter is in Italy: the God who is above all\r\nthe gods. The identity of the two deities is so striking that the\r\nancients themselves, forestalling comparative mythology, recognized it\r\nfrom the very first. He is the God, great and good amongst them all:\r\n_Jupiter, optimus, maximus_.\r\n\r\n_Varuna._--The most ancient of the religions of India, which the Vedas\r\nhave made known to us, has also a Zeus, whose name is Varuna.[40]\r\n\r\n    \"Truly admirable for grandeur are the works of Him who has separated\r\n    the two worlds and fixed their vast extent: of Him who has set in\r\n    motion the high and sublime firmament, who has spread out the\r\n    heavens above and the earth beneath.\r\n\r\n    \"These heavens and this earth which reach so far, flowing with milk,\r\n    so beautiful in form, it is by the law of Varuna that they remain\r\n    fixed, facing each other, immortal beings with fertile seed.\r\n\r\n    \"This Asura,[41] who is acquainted with all things, has propped up\r\n    these heavens, he has fixed the boundaries of the earth. He is\r\n    enthroned above all the worlds, universal king; all the laws of the\r\n    world are the laws of Varuna.\r\n\r\n    \"In the bottomless abyss the king Varuna has lifted up the summit of\r\n    the celestial tree.[42] It is the king Varuna who has traced out to\r\n    the sun the broad path he is to follow: to footless creatures he has\r\n    given feet so that they may run.\r\n\r\n    \"Those stars, which illumine the night, where were they during the\r\n    day? Infallible are the laws of Varuna: the moon kindles itself and\r\n    walks through the night.\r\n\r\n    \"Varuna has traced out paths for the sun: he has thrown forwards the\r\n    fluctuating torrent of rivers. He has dug out the wide and rapid\r\n    beds where the waves of the days, let loose, unroll themselves in\r\n    their order.\r\n\r\n    \"He has put strength into the horse, milk into the cow, intellect\r\n    into the heart, Agni[43] into the waters, the sun in the sky,\r\n    soma[44] into the stone.\r\n\r\n    \"The wind is thy breath, O Varuna! which roars in the atmosphere,\r\n    like the ox in the meadow. Between this earth and the sublime heaven\r\n    above, all things, O Varuna, are of thy creation.\"\r\n\r\nThere is an order in nature, there is a law, a habit, a rule, _a Rita_.\r\nThis law, this _Rita_, it is Varuna who has established it. He is the\r\ngod of the Rita, the god of Order, the guardian of the Rita; he is the\r\ngod of efficient and stable laws; in him rest as in a rock the fixed\r\nimmovable laws.\r\n\r\nOrganizer of the world, he is its master. He is the first of the Asuras,\r\n\"of the lords;\" he is _the Asura_, \"the Lord;\" he is the sovereign of\r\nthe whole world, the king of all beings, the universal king, the\r\nindependent king; no one amongst the gods dares to infringe his laws;\r\n\"it is thou, Varuna, who art the king of all.\"\r\n\r\nAs he has omnipotence, he has omniscience too, he is \"the Lord who knows\r\nall things,\" the _Asura viçva-vedas_. He is the sage who has supreme\r\nwisdom, in whom all sciences have their centre; when the poet wishes to\r\npraise the learning of a god, he compares it to that of Varuna. \"He\r\nknows the place of the birds which fly in the air, he knows the ships\r\nwhich are sailing on the ocean, he knows the twelve months and what they\r\nwill bring forth, he knows every creature that is born. He knows the\r\npath of the sublime wind in the heights, he knows who sits at the\r\nsacrifice. The God of stable laws, Varuna, has taken his place in his\r\npalace to be the universal king, the god with the wondrous intellect.\r\nHence, following in his mind all these marvels, he looks around him at\r\nwhat has happened and what will happen.\"\r\n\r\nAs he is the universal witness, he is also the universal judge, the\r\ninfallible judge whom nothing escapes: none can deceive him, and from\r\nabove he sees the evil done below and strikes it: he has sevenfold bands\r\nto clasp thrice round the liar by the upper, by the middle, and by the\r\nlower part of the body. The man, smitten by misfortune, implores his\r\npity, and feels that he has sinned, and that the hand which strikes is\r\nalso the hand that punishes:\r\n\r\n    \"I ask Thee, O Varuna, because I wish to know my fault:\r\n\r\n    \"I come to Thee, to question Thee who knowest all things. All the\r\n    sages, with one voice, said to me, Varuna is angry with thee.\r\n\r\n    \"What great crime have I committed, O Varuna, that thou shouldst\r\n    want to kill thy friend, thy bard. Tell me, O Lord, O infallible\r\n    one, and I will then lay my homage at thy feet.\r\n\r\n    \"Free me from the bonds of my crime, do not sever the thread of the\r\n    prayer that I am weaving, do not deliver me over to the deaths that,\r\n    at thy dictate, O Asura, strike him who has committed a crime: send\r\n    me not into the gloomy regions far from the light.\r\n\r\n    \"Let me pay the penalty of my faults; but let me not suffer, O King,\r\n    for the crime of others; there are so many days that have not dawned\r\n    yet! Let them dawn for us also, O Varuna!\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the supreme God of the Vedic religion, an organizing God,\r\nalmighty, omniscient, and moral. The following is a Vedic hymn which\r\nsums up with singular force the essential attributes of the God:--\r\n\r\n    \"He who from on high rules this world sees every thing as if it were\r\n    before him. That which two men, seated side by side are plotting, is\r\n    heard by king Varuna, himself the third.\r\n\r\n    \"This earth belongs to the king Varuna, and this sky, these two\r\n    sublime worlds with their remote limits; the two seas[45] are the\r\n    belly of Varuna, and he rests also even in this small pool of water.\r\n\r\n    \"He who should leap over the sky and beyond it, would not escape the\r\n    king Varuna: he has his spies, the spies of the heavens, who go\r\n    through the world; he has his thousand eyes which look on the earth.\r\n\r\n    \"The king Varuna sees everything, all that which is between the two\r\n    worlds and beyond them: he reckons the winking of the eye of all\r\n    creatures:\r\n\r\n    \"The world is in his hand like the dice in the hand of the gamester.\r\n\r\n    \"Let thy sevenfold bands, O Varuna, let thy bands of wrath which are\r\n    thrice linked together, let them enfold the man with a lying tongue,\r\n    let them leave free the man with a truthful tongue!\"\r\n\r\n_Ahura Mazda._[46]--Ancient Persia opposes to Zeus, to Jupiter, to\r\nVaruna, her Ormazd or Ahura Mazda.[47] \"It is through me,\" he said to\r\nhis prophet, Zoroaster, \"that the firmament, with its distant\r\nboundaries, hewn from the sparkling ruby, subsists without pillars to\r\nrest upon; it is through me that the earth, through me that the sun, the\r\nmoon, and the stars take their radiant course through the atmosphere; it\r\nwas I who formed the seeds in such a manner that, when sown in the\r\nearth, they should grow, spring up, and appear on the surface; it was I\r\nwho traced their veins in every species of plants, who in all beings put\r\nthe fire of life which does not consume them; it is I who in the\r\nmaternal womb produce the new-born child, who form the limbs, the skin,\r\nthe nails, the blood, the feet, the ears; it was I who gave the water\r\nfeet to run; it was I who made the clouds, which carry the water to the\r\nworld,\" &c. This development, taken from a recent book of the Ghebers,\r\nthe Bundahish, is to be found entire, in the very first words of their\r\noldest and holiest book, the Avesta: \"I proclaim and worship Ahura\r\nMazda, the _Creator_.\" As far as history can be traced, he was already\r\nwhat he is now. Near the ruins of the ancient Ecbatana, the traveller\r\nmay read, on the red granite of the mountain of Alvand, these words,\r\nwhich were engraved by the hand of Darius, the king of kings, nearly\r\nfive centuries before the birth of Christ:--\r\n\r\n    \"A powerful God is Aurâmazda!\r\n    'Twas he who made this earth here below!\r\n    'Twas he who made that heaven above!\r\n    'Twas he who made man!\"\r\n\r\nThis God, who made the world, rules it. He is the sovereign of the\r\nuniverse, the _Ahura_,[48] \"the Lord.\" \"He is a powerful god,\" exclaims\r\nXerxes; \"he is the greatest of all the gods.\" It is to his favour that\r\nDarius, inscribing upon the rock of Behistun the narrative of his\r\nnineteen victories, ascribes both his elevation and his triumphs. It is\r\nto his supreme care that he confides Persia: \"This country of Persia,\r\nwhich Aurâmazda has given me, this beautiful country, beautiful in\r\nhorses, beautiful in men, by the grace of Aurâmazda, and through me,\r\nking Darayavus, has nothing to fear from any enemy. May Aurâmazda and\r\nthe gods of the nation bring me their help! May Aurâmazda protect this\r\ncountry from hostile armies, from barrenness and evil! May this country\r\nnever be invaded by the stranger, nor by hostile armies, nor by\r\nbarrenness, nor by evil! This is the favour which I implore from\r\nAurâmazda and the gods of the nation!\"\r\n\r\nThis world which he has organized is a work of intelligence; by his\r\nwisdom it began, and by his wisdom it will end. He is the mind which\r\nknows all things, and it is to him that the sage appeals in order to\r\npenetrate the mysteries of the world.\r\n\r\n    \"Reveal to me the truth, O Ahura! What was the beginning of the good\r\n    creation?\r\n\r\n    \"Who is the father, who, at the beginning of time, begat Order?\r\n\r\n    \"Who has traced for the sun and the stars the paths that they must\r\n    follow?\r\n\r\n    \"Who makes the moon increase and decrease?\r\n\r\n    \"O Ahura! I would learn those mysteries and many more!\r\n\r\n    \"Who has fixed the earth and the immovable stars to establish them\r\n    firmly, so that they might not fall? Who has fixed the waters and\r\n    the trees?\r\n\r\n    \"Who has directed the rapid course of the wind and of the clouds?\r\n    What skilful artist has made the light and the darkness?\r\n\r\n    \"What skilful workman has made sleep and wakefulness? Through whom\r\n    have we dawn, noon, and night? From whom do they learn the law which\r\n    is traced out for them? Who endeared the son to his father so that\r\n    he should train him? Those are the things that I wish to ask Thee, O\r\n    Mazda, O beneficent Spirit, O Creator of all things!\"\r\n\r\nIn his omniscience are embraced all human actions. He watches over all\r\nthings, and is far-seeing, and never sleeping. He is the infallible one;\r\n\"it is impossible to deceive him, the Ahura, who knows all things.\" He\r\nsees man, and judges and chastises him, if he has not followed his law,\r\nfor from him comes the law of man, as well as the law of the world; from\r\nhim comes the science supreme among all other sciences, that of duty,\r\nthe knowledge of those things we ought to think, say, and do, and of\r\nthose things we ought neither to think, nor say, nor do. To the man who\r\nhas prayed well, thought, spoken, and acted well, he opens his\r\nresplendent paradise; he opens hell to him who has not prayed and who\r\nhas thought, spoken, and done evil.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme God, the God of Heaven.\r\n\r\nThus the Aryans of Greece, of Italy, of India, and of Persia agree in\r\ngiving the highest place in their Pantheon to a supreme God who rules\r\nthe world and who has founded order, a God sovereign, omniscient, and\r\nmoral. Has this identical conception been formed in each of these cases\r\nby four independent creations, or is it a common inheritance from the\r\nIndo-European religion, and did the Aryan ancestors of the Greeks, of\r\nthe Latins, of the Hindoos, and of the Persians already know a supreme\r\nGod, an organizing, a sovereign, an omniscient, a moral God?\r\n\r\nAlthough the latter hypothesis is more simple and more probable than the\r\nformer, it cannot, however, be taken at once as certain; because an\r\nabstract and logical conception of this kind may very well have\r\ndeveloped itself at the same time among several nations, in an identical\r\nand independent manner. To whomsoever looks upon it at any time and in\r\nany place, the world can reveal the existence of a Supreme maker:\r\nSocrates is not the disciple of the psalmist; yet the heavens reveal to\r\nhim, as to the Hebrew poet, the glory of the Lord. But if it be found\r\nthat the abstract conception is closely connected with a naturalistic\r\nand material conception, and that the latter is identical in the four\r\nreligions, as it is known, on the other hand, that these four religions\r\nhave a common past, the hypothesis that this abstract conception is a\r\nheritage of this past, and not a creation of the present, may rise to a\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nNow, these Gods who organize the world, rule it and watch over it; this\r\nZeus, this Jupiter, this Varuna, this Ahura Mazda are not the\r\npersonifications of a simple abstract conception; they emerge from a\r\nformer naturalism, from which they are not yet quite detached; they\r\ncommenced by being gods of the heavens.\r\n\r\nZeus and Jupiter have never ceased to be gods of the heavens, and to be\r\nconscious of it. When the world was shared among the gods, \"Zeus\r\nreceived the boundless sky in the ether and the clouds for his share.\"\r\nIt is as the God of heaven that sometimes he shines luminous, calm, and\r\npure, enthroned in the ethereal splendour, and that sometimes he becomes\r\ngloomy and gathers clouds (=nephelêgeretês=), causing the rain to fall\r\nfrom heaven (=ombrios=, =hyetios=), hurling upon the earth the eddy of\r\nfierce winds, drawing forth the hurricane from the summit of the ether,\r\nbrandishing the lightning and the thunderbolt (=keraunios=, =astrapaios=).\r\nThis is why the thunderbolt is his weapon, his attribute, \"the\r\nthunderbolt with its never-tiring foot,\" which he hurls in the heights;\r\nwhy he rolls on a resounding chariot, brandishing in his hand the fiery\r\ntrident, or dashing it on the wings of the eagle, or on Pegasus, the\r\naërial steed of the lightning. This is why he is the husband of Dêmêter,\r\n\"the mother Earth,\" whom he impregnates with his torrents of rain; this\r\nis why he sent forth, from his brow according to some, from his belly\r\naccording to others, from the clouds according to the Cretan legend,\r\nAthênê, the resplendent goddess with the penetrating glance, who came\r\nforth, shaking golden weapons, with a cry which made heaven and earth\r\nresound, as she is the incarnation of the stormy light which breaks\r\nforth from the brow of heaven, from the belly of heaven, from the bosom\r\nof the cloud, filling space with its splendour and with the crash of its\r\nstormy birth. Lastly, the very name of Zeus (genitive _Dios_, formerly\r\n_Divos_) is, in conformity with the laws of Greek phonetics, the literal\r\nrepresentative of the Sanscrit Dyaus, heaven (genitive _Divas_), and the\r\nunion of =Zeus patêr= with =Dêmêtêr= is the exact counterpart of the\r\nVedic union of _Dyaus pitar_ with _Prithivî mâtar_, of the Heaven-Father\r\nwith Earth-Mother. The word =Zeus= is an ancient synonym of =Ouranos=,\r\nwhich became obsolete as a common noun; still, in a certain number of\r\nexpressions, it retains something of its former meaning. Thus it is,\r\nwhen the Earth prays Zeus to let rain fall upon her; when the Athenian\r\nin praying exclaims: \"O dear Zeus, rain thou on the field of the\r\nAthenians and on the plains\"--\"Zeus has rained the whole night,\" says\r\nHomer: =hye Zeus pannychos=. In all these expressions Zeus may be\r\nliterally translated as a common noun, _sky_.\r\n\r\nJupiter, identical with Zeus in his functions, is identical with him in\r\nhis material attributes.\r\n\r\nThe word Jûpiter, or better Jup-piter, is for Jus-piter, composed of\r\n_pater_ and of _Jus_, the Latin contraction of the Sanscrit _Dyaus_, of\r\nthe Greek =Zeus=: Juppiter is then the exact equivalent of =Zeus patêr=,\r\nand the word has even preserved more strongly than Zeus the sense of its\r\nearly meaning; _sub Jove_ signifies \"under the heavens;\" the hunter\r\nawaits the marsian boar, heedless of the cold or snow, _sub Jove\r\nfrigido_, \"under the cold Jupiter, under the cold sky.\" Dyaus is also in\r\nLatin, as it is in Sanscrit, the name of the brilliant sky: \"Behold,\"\r\nexclaims old Ennius, \"above thy head this luminous space which all\r\ninvoke under the name of Jupiter:\"\r\n\r\n    \"Aspice hoc sublime candens quem invocant omnes Jovem.\"\r\n\r\nVaruna, like his European brethren, has been, and is yet, a material\r\ngod, and a material god of the same kind, a god of heaven. This is why\r\nthe sun is his eye, why the sun, \"the beautiful bird which flies in the\r\nfirmament,\" is \"his golden-winged messenger;\"[49] why the celestial\r\nrivers flow in the hollow of his mouth, as in the hollow of a reed; why\r\neverywhere visible, by turns full of light and of darkness, by turns he\r\ninfolds himself in the night, and irradiates the dawns, and by turns\r\nclothes himself in the white garments and in the black ones. Like Zeus,\r\nand from the same cause, he gathers together the clouds, he turns the\r\nsack that contains the rains, and lets it loose upside down on the two\r\nworlds; he inundates the heaven and the earth, he clothes the mountains\r\nwith a watery garb, and his blood-red eyes unceasingly furrow the watery\r\ndwelling with their twinkling flashes. As Zeus is the father of Athênê,\r\nhe is the father of Atharvan, \"the Fire-God,\" of Bhrigu, \"the\r\nThunderer\"--that is to say, of Agni, of the lightning. Agni himself is\r\nbrought forth \"from his belly in the waters,\" like a male Athênê.\r\nFinally, like Zeus, like Jupiter, he bears in his very name the\r\nexpression of what he is; and the Sanscrit Varuna is the exact phonetic\r\nrepresentative of =Ouranos=, sky.\r\n\r\nIn fine, the sovereign god of Persia, notwithstanding the character of\r\nprofound abstraction which he has acquired and which is reflected in his\r\nname Ahura Mazda, \"the omniscient Lord,\" can himself be recognized as a\r\ngod of the heavens. The ancient formulæ of the litanies still show that\r\nhe is luminous and corporeal; they invoke the creator Ahura Mazda,\r\nresplendent, very great, very beautiful, corporeally beautiful; white,\r\nluminous, seen from afar; they invoke the entire body of Ahura Mazda,\r\nthe body of Ahura which is the greatest of bodies; they say that the sun\r\nis his eye, and that the sky is the garment embroidered with stars with\r\nwhich he arrays himself; lastly, the most abstract of the Aryan gods has\r\npreserved a trait which shows him more closely tied than the others to\r\nthe material world from which they have freed themselves; he is called\r\n\"the most solid of the gods,\" because \"he has for clothing the very\r\nsolid stone of the sky.\" Like Varuna, like Zeus, the lightning is in his\r\nhands, \"the molten brass which he causes to flow down on the two\r\nworlds;\" like them he is the father of the god of lightning, Atar.\r\nLastly, the most ancient historical evidence confirms the inductions of\r\nmythology, as at the very time when the Achæmenian kings proclaim the\r\nsovereignty of Aurâmazda, Herodotus wrote: \"The Persians offer up\r\nsacrifices to Zeus,[50] going up on the highest summit of the mountains,\r\nas they call _Zeus the entire orb of the sky_.\"\r\n\r\nThus the supreme gods of the four great religions of Greece, of Italy,\r\nof India, and of Persia, are at the same time, or have begun by being\r\ngods of the skies. By the side of these four, Svarogu, the god of the\r\nancient pagan Slavs, should no doubt equally be placed. Like Zeus, like\r\nJupiter, like Varuna, like Ahura Mazda, he is the master of the\r\nuniverse, the gods are his children, and it is from him that they have\r\nreceived their functions; like them he is the god of the heavens, he is\r\nthe thunderer, and like them he is the father of the Fire, Svarojitchi,\r\n\"the son of heaven.\"[51]\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Origin.[52]\r\n\r\nHow did the god of the heavens become the organizing god, the supreme\r\nGod, the moral God? How was the abstract conception grafted on the\r\nnaturalistic conception? What is the connection between his material\r\nattribute and his abstract function? The Vedas give the solution of this\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nAs far as the eye can reach, it can never reach beyond the sky; whatever\r\nis, is under the immense vault; all that which is born and dies, is born\r\nand dies within its bounds. Now, whatever takes place in it, takes place\r\naccording to an immutable law. The dawn has never failed to appear at\r\nher appointed place in the morning, never forgotten where she is to\r\nappear again, nor the moment at which she is to reanimate the world.\r\nDarkness and light know their appointed hour, and always at the desired\r\nmoment \"the black One has given way to the white.\" Linked together by\r\nthe same chain in the endless path open before them, they follow their\r\nway onwards, the two immortals, directed by a God, absorbing each\r\nother's tints. The two fertile sisters do not clash with one another;\r\nthey never stop, dissimilar in form, but alike in spirit. Thus run the\r\ndays with their suns, the nights with their stars, season following\r\nseason. The sky has always in regular course ushered in by turn the day\r\nand the night. The moon has always lit up at the fixed hour. The stars\r\nhave always known where they should go during the day. The rivers have\r\nalways flowed into the one ocean without making it full.\r\n\r\nThis universal order is either the motion of the heavens, or it is the\r\naction of the God of heaven, according as we think of the body or the\r\nsoul, and view in the heavens the thing or the God. Thus, in the\r\nRig-Veda, to say \"everything is _in_ Varuna\"--that is, \"in the\r\nheavens\"--and to say \"everything is _through_ Varuna\"--that is, \"through\r\nthe heaven-God\"--are one and the same thing; and in these formulæ of the\r\nVeda, so clear in their uncertainty, theism is ever found side by side\r\nwith unconscious pantheism, of which it is only an expression. \"The\r\nthree heavens and the three earths rest in Varuna,\" says a poet, and\r\nimmediately afterwards, giving personality to his God: \"It is the\r\nskilful king Varuna who makes this golden disc shine in heaven.\" The\r\nwind which whistles in the atmosphere is his breath, and all that exists\r\nfrom one world to the other was created by him. \"From the king Varuna\r\ncome this earth below, and yonder heaven, too, these two worlds with\r\nremote limits; the two seas are the belly of Varuna, and he rests also\r\neven in the small pool of water.\"\r\n\r\nThis pantheistic theism, which makes no clear distinction between the\r\nGod of heaven and the universe over which he rules, or which is\r\ncomprised in him, penetrates Jupiter as well as Varuna. The Latin poets\r\noffer the equivalent of the vacillating formulæ of Vedism. \"The\r\nmortals,\" says Lucretius, explaining the origin of the idea of God, \"the\r\nmortals saw the regular motions of the heavens and the various seasons\r\nof the year succeed each other in a fixed order, without being able to\r\ndiscover the causes. They had, therefore, no other alternative than to\r\nattribute all to the gods, who made everything go according to their\r\nwill, and it was in the sky that they placed the seat and domain of the\r\ngods, because it is there that may be seen revolve the night and the\r\nnoon, the day and the gloomy planets of the night; the nocturnal lights\r\nwandering in the sky, and the flying flames, the clouds, the sun, the\r\nrain, the snow, the winds, the thunderbolts, the hail, the sudden\r\nconvulsions, and the great threatening rumblings.\"[53]\r\n\r\nThis view of the heavens as the universal centre of the movements of\r\nNature might just as well have led to pantheism as to theism. The line\r\nof the poet: \"Juppiter est quodcunque vides, quocunque\r\nmoveris\"--\"Jupiter is everything that thou seest, everywhere that thou\r\nmovest\"--does not refer only to the Jupiter of the metaphysicians of the\r\nPorch; it also expresses one of the aspects of the Jupiter of primitive\r\nmythology. It was not by a deviation from his earlier nature that Zeus\r\nwas confounded with Pan; he was Pan by birth; and if the epopee and the\r\ndrama show us only a personal Zeus, it is because by their very nature\r\nthey could and should see him only under this aspect, and had nothing to\r\nobtain from the impersonal Zeus, although in this form he was as old as\r\nin the other. And the Orphic theologian is not quite unfaithful to the\r\nearlier tradition of religion, when he sings of the universal Zeus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Zeus was the first, Zeus is the last, Zeus the thunderer;\r\n    Zeus is the head, Zeus is the middle; it is by Zeus that all things\r\n      are made;\r\n    Zeus is the male, Zeus is the immortal female;\r\n    Zeus is the base of both the earth and the starry sky;\r\n    Zeus is the breath of the winds, Zeus is the jet of the\r\n      unconquerable flame;\r\n    Zeus is the root of the sea, Zeus is the sun and the moon....\r\n    The whole of this universe is stretched out within the great body\r\n      of Zeus.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, although Persia has in general preserved the\r\npersonality of her Supreme god, yet she suffers him, especially in the\r\nsects, to become confounded with the Infinity of matter through which he\r\nfirst revealed himself to the mind of his worshippers. After having\r\ninvoked the heavens as the body of Ahura Mazda, the most beautiful of\r\nbodies, she placed above Ahura himself, and before him, the luminous\r\nspace, where he manifests himself, what the theologians called \"the\r\nInfinite light,\" and then by a new and higher abstraction declared\r\n_Space_[54] to have been at the beginning of the world. Between this\r\nwholly metaphysical principle and the naturalistic principle of the\r\nprimitive religion, there is only the distance of two abstractions:\r\nSpace is only the bare form of the luminous Infinite, and the luminous\r\nInfinite, again, is an abstraction from the Infinite and luminous sky,\r\nwhich was identical with Ahura.\r\n\r\nThus, accordingly as the heavens were considered as the seat or as the\r\ncause of things, the god of the heavens became the matter of the world\r\nor the demiurge of the world. From the period of Aryan unity, he was\r\nwithout doubt the one and the other in turn; but it is probable that the\r\ntheistic conception was more clearly defined than the other, as it is so\r\nin the derived mythologies; it has besides deeper roots in the human\r\nheart and human nature, which in every movement and in every phenomenon\r\nsees a Living Cause, a Personality.\r\n\r\nThis god of the heavens, having organized the world, is all wisdom; he\r\nis the skilled artisan who has regulated the motion of the worlds. His\r\nwisdom is infinite, for of all those mysteries which man tries in vain\r\nto fathom he has the key, he is the author. But it is not only as the\r\nCreator of the world that he is omniscient: he knows all things,\r\nbecause, being all light, he sees all things. In the naturalistic\r\npsychology of the Aryans, to see and to know, light and knowledge, eye\r\nand thought, are synonymous terms. With the Hindoos, Varuna is\r\nomniscient because he is the Infinite light; because the sun is his eye;\r\nbecause from the height of his palace with its pillars of red brass, his\r\nwhite looks command the world; because under the golden mantle that\r\ncovers him, his thousands, his myriads of spies, active and untiring\r\nagents, sunbeams during the day, stars during the night, search out for\r\nhim all that which exists from one world to the other, with eyes that\r\nnever sleep, never blink. And in the same way, if Zeus is the\r\nall-seeing, the =panoptês=, it is because his eye is the sun, this\r\nuniversal witness, the infallible spy of both gods and men (= Theôn\r\nskopon êde kai andrôn=). The light knows the truth, it is all truth;\r\ntruth is the great virtue which the god of heaven claims; and lying is\r\nthe great crime which he punishes. In Homer, the Greek taking an oath,\r\nraises his eyes towards the expanse of heaven and calls Zeus and the sun\r\nto witness; in Persia, the god of heaven resembles in body the light,\r\nand in soul the truth: Aryan morality came down from heaven in a ray of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Destiny.\r\n\r\nThus, the Indo-European religion knew a supreme God, and this God was\r\nthe God of the heavens. He has organized the world and rules it,\r\nbecause, as he is the heaven, all is in him, and all passes within him,\r\naccording to his law; he is omniscient and moral, because, being\r\nluminous, he sees all things and all hearts.\r\n\r\nThis God was named by the various names of the sky--Dyaus, Varana, Svar,\r\nwhich, according to the requirements of the thought, described either\r\nthe object or the person, the heavens or the God. Later on, each\r\nlanguage made a choice, and fixed the proper name of the God on one of\r\nthese words; by which its ancient value as a common noun was lost or\r\nrendered doubtful: thus, in Greek _Dyaus_ became the name of the\r\nheaven-god (Zeus) and Varana (=Ouranos=) was the name of the heavens, as\r\na thing; in Sanscrit _Dyaus_ or _Svar_ was the material heavens; the\r\nheaven-god was Varana (later changed into Varuna); the Slavs fixed on\r\nthe word Svar, by means of a derivative, Svarogu, the idea of the\r\ncelestial god; the Romans made the same choice as the Greeks with their\r\n_Jup-piter_, and set aside the other names of the heavens; lastly,\r\nPersia described the god by one of his abstract epithets, the Lord,\r\nAhura, and obliterated the external traces of his former naturalistic\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThis god, who reigned at the time of the breaking up of the religion of\r\nAryan unity, was carried away, with the various religions which sprang\r\nup from it, to the various regions where chance brought the Aryan\r\nmigrations. Of the five religions over which he ruled, three remained\r\nfaithful to him to the last, and only forsook him at the moment when\r\nthey themselves perished;--they are those of the Greeks, of the Romans,\r\nand of the Slavs, with whom Zeus, Juppiter, and Svarogu preserved the\r\ntitles and attributes of the Supreme god of the Aryans, as long as the\r\nnational religion lasted. They succumbed to Christ; \"Heaven-father\" gave\r\nway to the \"Father who is in Heaven.\"\r\n\r\nIndia, on the contrary, very soon forgot that god for whose origin and\r\nformation, however, she accounts much better than any other Aryan\r\nreligion does; and it was not a foreign god who dethroned him--a god\r\nfrom without--but a native god, a god of his own family, Indra, the hero\r\nof the tempest.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the supreme god of the Aryans was not a god of unity; the\r\nAsura, the Lord, was not the Lord in the same sense as Adonai. There\r\nwere by the side of him, within himself, a number of gods, acting of\r\ntheir own accord, and often of independent origin. The wind, the rain,\r\nthe thunder; the fire under its three forms--the sun in the heavens, the\r\nlightning in the cloud, the terrestrial fire on the altar; the prayer\r\nunder its two forms--the human prayer, which ascends from the altar to\r\nheaven, and the heavenly prayer, which resounds in the din of the storm,\r\non the lips of a divine priest, and descends from the heights with the\r\ntorrents of libations poured from the cup of heaven, all the forces of\r\nnature, both concrete and abstract, appealing at once to the eye and to\r\nthe imagination of man, were instantly deified. If the god of the\r\nheavens, greater in time and space, always present and everywhere\r\npresent, easily rose to the supreme rank, carried there by his double\r\nInfinity, yet others, with a less continuous, but more dramatic action,\r\nrevealing themselves by sudden, unexpected events, maintained their\r\nancient independence, and religious development might lead to their\r\nusurping the power of the king of the heavens. Already during the middle\r\nof the Vedic period, Indra, the noisy god of the storm, ascends the\r\nsummit of the Pantheon, and eclipses his majestic rival by the din of\r\nhis resounding splendour.\r\n\r\nHe is the favourite hero of the Vedic Rishis; they do not tire of\r\ntelling how he strikes with his bolt the serpent of the cloud, which\r\nenfolds the light and the waters; how he shatters the cavern of Cambara,\r\nhow he delivers the captive Auroras and cows, who will shed torrents of\r\nlight and milk on the earth. It is he who makes the sun come out again;\r\nit is he who makes the world, annihilated during the night, reappear; it\r\nis he who recreates it, he who creates it. In a whole series of hymns he\r\nascends to the side of Varuna, and shares the empire with him; at last\r\nhe mounts above him, and becomes the Universal King:--\r\n\r\n    \"He, who, as soon as he was born, a god of thought, has surpassed\r\n    the gods by the power of his intellect, he whose trembling made the\r\n    two worlds quake by the power of his strength--O man, it is Indra!\r\n\r\n    \"He, who has firmly established the tottering earth and arrested the\r\n    quivering mountains; he who has fixed the extent of the\r\n    wide-stretching atmosphere, and who has propped up the sky,--O man,\r\n    it is Indra!\r\n\r\n    \"He, who, after slaying the serpent, unpenned the seven rivers; who\r\n    brought forth the cows from their hiding-place in the cavern; he,\r\n    who, by the clashing of the two stones, has engendered Agni,--O man,\r\n    it is Indra!\r\n\r\n    \"He, who made all these great things; he, who struck down the demon\r\n    race, driving it to concealment; he, who, like a fortunate gamester\r\n    who wins at play, carries off the wealth of the impious,--O man, it\r\n    is Indra!\r\n\r\n    \"He, who gives life to both rich and poor, and to the priest his\r\n    singer who implores him; the god with beautiful lips; the protecting\r\n    god who brings the stones together to press out the soma,--O man, it\r\n    is Indra!\r\n\r\n    \"He, who has in his hands the herds of horses and cows, the cities\r\n    and the chariots of war; he, who has created the Sun and the dawn;\r\n    he, who rules the waters,--O man, it is Indra!\r\n\r\n    \"He, who is invoked by the two contending armies, by the enemies\r\n    facing each other, either triumphant or beaten; he, whom, when they\r\n    meet in the struggle on the same chariot, during the onslaught, they\r\n    invoke against each other,--O man, it is Indra!\r\n\r\n    \"He, who discovered Çambara in the mountains where he had been\r\n    hidden forty years; he, who killed the serpent in his full strength,\r\n    who struck him dead on the body of Dânu,[55]--O man, it is Indra!\r\n\r\n    \"Heaven and earth bow down before him; when he shakes, the mountains\r\n    tremble; the drinker of soma, look at him! bearing the bolt in his\r\n    arm, the bolt in his hand,--O man, it is Indra!\"\r\n\r\nBut the usurper does not enjoy his triumph long; in the heat of his\r\nvictory he is already stung to the heart, mortally wounded by a new and\r\nmystic power which is growing at his side, the power of prayer, of\r\nsacrifice, of worship, of _Brahma_, whose reign begins to dawn towards\r\nthe end of the Vedic period, and which is still in existence.\r\n\r\nWhat Indra did in India during an historical period, Perkun and Odin did\r\nin a pre-historical period, the one among the Lithuanians, the other\r\namong the Germans. Perkun and Odin are the Indras of these two nations,\r\nand have each dethroned the god of the heavens. Perkun was the god of\r\nthe thunder with the Lithuanian pagans, and one can recognize in him a\r\ntwin brother of the Hindoo _Parjanya_, one of the forms of the god of\r\nthe storm in Vedic mythology. This king of the Lithuanian Pantheon is a\r\nking of recent date; what proves it is that the Slavs, so closely\r\nrelated to the Lithuanians in their beliefs, as well as in their\r\nlanguage, and who also knew the god Perkun, have still as their Supreme\r\ngod the Supreme god of the ancient Aryan religion, the god of the\r\nheavens, Svarogu.\r\n\r\nThe same revolution took place in Germany, but in a more remote period.\r\nThe god of the heavens has vanished; he is replaced by the god of the\r\nstormy atmosphere, Odin, or Wuotan, the Vâta of India, the warrior god\r\nwho is heard in the din of the tempest, leading his dishevelled bands of\r\nwarriors, or letting loose on a celestial quarry the howling packs of\r\nthe wild chase.\r\n\r\nThus did the Greeks, the Romans, and the Slavs allow their god to be\r\nvanquished by a foreign god; the Germans, the Lithuanians, and the\r\nHindoos themselves forsook him for an inferior creation. Only in one\r\nsingle nation he finds worshippers faithful to the last. They are not\r\nnumerous, but they have not allowed their belief to be encroached upon\r\neither by time or by man. We mean the few thousands of Ghebers or\r\nParsis, who, during the great political and religious shipwreck of\r\nPersia, fleeing before the victorious sword of the Prophet, kept from\r\nIslam the treasure of their old belief, and who to this day, in the year\r\n1879 of the Christian era, in the fire temples in Bombay, offer up\r\nsacrifices to the very same god who was sung by the unknown ancestors of\r\nthe Aryan race at a time which eludes the grasp of history.\r\n\r\n    JAMES DARMESTETER.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[38] Cf.

They have been conceived for the most part with a\r\ngenuine feeling of the immense importance of this, the most burning and\r\nmomentous question of modern days, and illumined in many cases with deep\r\nphilosophic insight; yet, as it is almost impossible for any but a born\r\nproletarian to understand the needs, the wants and the daily lives of\r\nthe proletarian, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the absence of\r\nthis special knowledge may have contributed somewhat to the\r\nunworkableness of the various systems proposed. Beyond this, however, it\r\nstrikes me that most of them contained a fatal flaw, inherent in their\r\nconstitutions. They were too ambitious, aimed at too much, and were\r\naltogether of so revolutionary and subversive a character as to alarm\r\nthe great majority of those whose goodwill must be obtained before it\r\ncan be possible to reduce any theory to experiment on a sufficiently\r\nextended scale to enable an unprejudiced observer to pronounce\r\ndecisively on the result accomplished.\r\n\r\nWere it not that the accident of my having been thrown by birth and\r\nassociation amongst the very poorest of the poor (\"but indifferent\r\nhonest\") community of a large city may enable me to supplement to some\r\nextent the ideas enunciated by benevolent theorists belonging to the\r\nupper strata of society, I should not have the temerity to seek to pass\r\nout of the region of the \"eternal silences.\" Moreover, I do not announce\r\na new and perfect evangel to be ushered in by loud flourish of trumpets.\r\nI aim at nothing more ambitious than to be allowed to offer a few hints\r\nas to the direction which I conceive future gospels of humanity must\r\ntake in order to be of practical utility.\r\n\r\nHaving thus endeavoured to justify myself for rushing in where sometimes\r\n\"angels fear to tread,\" I have no intention of apologizing for the\r\ncrudeness of my ideas, or my lack of grace in literary composition.\r\nTaking into consideration the small amount of elementary education\r\ndrilled into me at a charity school for a brief period of my very\r\njuvenile days, and the continued absence of any duly qualified\r\ninstructor since, \"all that goes without saying.\"\r\n\r\nOne more egotistical, or egoistical, remark, and I proceed. I am in no\r\nsense a _specialist_. I am neither a Good Templar nor a Convivial Toper;\r\nneither a disciple of Nihilism, nor any other school of advanced thought\r\n(so called), nor a bigoted sectarian. I am a private in neither the\r\nranks of bovine Toryism nor of rabid Radicalism; but I write simply as\r\none of that common ruck of ordinary practical working men, which in\r\nreality forms the great staple of our plebiscite, although certain very\r\nnoisy and turbulent minorities may possibly have led to a contrary\r\ninference.\r\n\r\nIn the erection of my little structure, I, like all other architects,\r\nrequire a good foundation as the basis of operations; and in the present\r\ncase the foundation required is simply a desire on the part of those\r\nbipeds who stand erect on pedestals for an increased knowledge of their\r\nfellows who crawl and kneel and lie in a thousand and one contorted\r\npostures on the miry clay. Enlarged knowledge will bring enlarged\r\nsympathy for each other on the part of high and low alike. As matters\r\nnow stand, those above us never really see us in undress. When they come\r\nacross us we are either too slavishly sycophantic or too ruggedly\r\nindependent,--both being masks donned for the occasion,--and not in any\r\nsense our natural selves; and I have a dim kind of suspicion that on the\r\nfew occasions when gentlemen voluntarily come forward and try to make us\r\nbelieve that they are taking us into their confidence--on the hustings,\r\nsay, for instance--some disguise of the same kind may be adopted, and\r\nthat the features we then see are not altogether the real ones. If I am\r\nright in this assumption, how is it possible for either class to have\r\nanything like a competent knowledge of the other? Indeed, I do not think\r\nI should be far wrong in saying that the manners and customs of the\r\nFijian Islanders and other aborigines of distant lands are better known\r\ngenerally to the upper ten thousand than those of the lower native\r\nmillions; and, of course, the converse holds equally good. Domestic\r\nservants, perhaps, may be said to form exceptions to this latter rule,\r\nseeing that they often have peeps into the innermost arcana; but as they\r\nare for the most part--the male portion of them at all events--more\r\nutterly inexplicable beings than their masters, the general fund of\r\ninformation is not much increased through that channel. Flunkeydom is\r\nmuch more insufferable and incomprehensible to the general run of us\r\nthan swelldom itself.\r\n\r\nGranted, however, the desire for a better acquaintance with their\r\nhumbler brethren on the part of our aristocracy and plutocracy (for\r\nthis, like all other good things, must _descend_ from above), it will be\r\nfound that, as a mutual understanding of each other's peculiarities is\r\nincreased, the rich man (in this paper, as in an Act of Parliament,\r\nwords denoting persons of the masculine gender shall be construed as\r\nincluding persons of the feminine gender also) will bestow a little less\r\ncareful thought and attention on--shall I say partridges?--and more on\r\nhis fellow-man; and the bitter class-prejudice which undoubtedly exists\r\namong the needy against the prosperous and well-fed will gradually die\r\nout. Then, and then only, will a new and brighter era dawn on \"poor\r\nhumanity;\" and, I may say, that I hold optimist views with reference to\r\nthis consummation. I think I observe a growing acknowledgment of the\r\nclaims of humble folk in the literature of the day; and as literature is\r\nuniversally regarded as an outcome of the prevalent tone of feeling, I\r\nlook upon this as a good omen.\r\n\r\nHaving worked myself into this happy frame of mind, I am emboldened to\r\nrequest that consideration may be given to a few examples of the ideas\r\nwhich, \"in the stillness of the night,\" and otherwise, have intruded\r\nthemselves upon me--ideas embryonic and unformed, I doubt not, but\r\ngenuine as far as they go. From the multitude of these shadowy phantoms\r\nwhich have now for a long time past oppressed me, I select those which\r\nstrike me as having special reference to the improvement of our poor\r\npopulations in four of the salient matters of life--viz., in health,\r\npocket, mind, and amusements; and these I will deal with _seriatim_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth.\r\n\r\nThis, amongst all sublunary blessings, is undoubtedly the one of\r\nparamount importance, and, seeing how things now stand with us, it is\r\nimperative that it should be _the_ question to receive earliest\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nI think it is the Rev. Harry Jones who, in one of his warm-hearted\r\nessays, liken as rotten, worn-out, filthy habitation to a lump of putrid\r\ncarrion, exhaling poison all around, and which should be as\r\nremorselessly cut out from amongst the dwellings of human beings as a\r\nfly-blown spot is cut out from a carcass. This simile, perhaps, is not a\r\nvery savoury one, but it possesses a much greater merit, that of being\r\n_absolutely true_--slightly vulgar, but astonishingly correct. I could\r\nillustrate its verity by many pertinent instances which have come within\r\nmy own experience, but I feel that this is not the place to do so. What\r\nthen is the remedy? Obviously to re-enact the present \"Artizans'\r\nDwellings Improvement Act\" as a _compulsory_ statute, and not as an\r\noptional one. Let the squalid, crazy, tumble-down rookeries which exist\r\nin every town in the kingdom be ruthlessly demolished, care, of course,\r\nbeing taken that suitable dwellings are cotemporaneously built on better\r\nsanitary principles for those whom it will be necessary to evict in\r\norder to carry out such improvements. And I would suggest, as a branch\r\nof the pervading idea which forms the centre and core of my suggestions\r\n(of which more anon), that the Municipal Corporations of our cities and\r\ntowns should be themselves in their official capacity the landlords of\r\nsuch new and improved dwellings, and should employ their own tradesmen\r\nto build them. And, furthermore, that in the erection of whatever new\r\ncottages may be found necessary for the purpose indicated, the\r\nlatter-day style of running them up all alike, as uniform as so many\r\nsquares of glass in a sash, should be abandoned, and a little variety of\r\nstyle, if only in trifling particulars, introduced. Human nature, even\r\nthe human nature of the uneducated poor, rebels against this painful\r\nmonotony, and grows intensely weary of over-much regularity, which, if a\r\nvirtue at all, is one of so starched and rigid a character, that it\r\ntakes a considerable amount of resolution, and a far higher degree of\r\nculture than we can lay claim to, to enable us to fall in love with it.\r\nTo our uninstructed eyes, diversity of form is much more pleasing than\r\nundeviating rectangularity.\r\n\r\nAgain, the most painstaking care must be taken that these substituted\r\ndomiciles be properly and thoroughly drained. Unhappily, although this\r\nis a truism and a self-evident proposition, it is, through carelessness\r\nor indifference, frequently neglected--a fact too sadly attested by the\r\nravages of fever from time to time in our outlying districts, where,\r\ntwenty years ago, the bricklayer and hodman had not arrived upon the\r\nscene. To obviate this it is absolutely necessary that the most skilled\r\nscience should be employed, and the most searching local legislation\r\nstrictly enforced, to secure the carrying out of approved sewerage and\r\ndrainage systems.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would suggest that no horse or cattle slaughterer,\r\ntallow-melter, manure-merchant, tanner, or other person plying any of\r\nthe trades known as noisome or offensive, should be allowed to continue\r\nsuch trades without a special licence, and that by the terms of such\r\nlicence they should be prohibited, under heavy penalties, from carrying\r\non their businesses outside the limits of a certain area to be expressly\r\nset aside for that purpose, at such a distance from the centre of every\r\ntown as may be judged desirable by the sanitary authorities. Within this\r\narea pig-styes and fowl-houses should be erected, and no swine, ducks,\r\nor geese be permitted to be kept outside its boundary. An inspector\r\nshould be appointed specially for this quarter of the town, who should\r\ndirect all his energies to seeing that the best principles of\r\nventilation, smoke-consumption, drainage, use of disinfectants, &c. &c.,\r\nare adopted throughout his domain; and all ill-conditioned recusants\r\nagainst the decrees of the local senate should be mulcted in heavy\r\ndamages. On the part of the senate itself there must be no apathy, no\r\nsupineness, no dilettanteism, but a stern, vigorous determination\r\nstringently and impartially to enforce prompt obedience to its edicts.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this would be somewhat of a hardship upon certain individuals,\r\non the score of inconvenience and increased cost of production; but I\r\ndoubt not they would take care to indemnify themselves. Even were it\r\notherwise, however, the aggregate gain in so important a matter as the\r\npublic health must swamp all minor considerations. Private interests\r\nmust inevitably be sacrificed in the advancement of the general weal.\r\nAll the Mrs. Partingtons that ever existed, with all their mops (whether\r\nsuch mops are called monopolies, vested rights, or what not), must\r\nperforce recede before the rising tide of the ocean of civilization.\r\n\r\nHaving well drained our streets and habitations, and consecrated a\r\n_quartier_ for the purposes last mentioned, the next step must be to\r\nincrease the number of our iron hospitals; and, disregarding\r\nsentimentality, immediately to isolate and put in quarantine all persons\r\nsuffering from infectious diseases. Firmly grasp this nettle the moment\r\nit crops up, and without a shadow of doubt you will reduce to a minimum\r\nthe high rate of mortality at present existing in our overcrowded cities\r\nthrough a total neglect of proper precaution. All textile fabrics,\r\nbedding, books, &c., which have come in contact with the patient, to be\r\nconsumed by fire. Even Vandalism is excusable, nay, commendable, in\r\ncertain circumstances.\r\n\r\nFinally, on this branch of the subject, I submit for the consideration\r\nof municipalities the following recommendations:--\r\n\r\n1. Preserve or procure open spaces, sufficient to form recreation\r\ngrounds for your communities--say an acre for every thousand\r\ninhabitants. Regard this to be quite as imperative a necessity as the\r\nacquisition of further land to add to the cemeteries in which you inter\r\nthe bodies of those who have \"gone over to the majority.\" Let the quick\r\nshare your care and attention on equal terms with the dead in the matter\r\nof requisite space and accommodation.\r\n\r\n2. Cause your common lodging-houses and your still worse haunts to be\r\nunder the most vigilant supervision; and that _constantly_, and not\r\nfitfully and spasmodically. The more severe and restrictive your\r\nregulations are with reference to these matters the better it will be\r\nfor all decent, quiet citizens.\r\n\r\n3. Provide every householder within your jurisdiction with a _filter_,\r\nto insure to him and his the opportunity of enjoying water free from\r\norganic and other impurities.\r\n\r\n4. Furnish him also with two boxes, varying in size according to the\r\ndimensions of his domicile: one to form a receptacle for dust, cinders,\r\nold rags, broken bottles, and what is generically known as \"dry dirt;\"\r\nand the other for decayed vegetables, the entrails of fish, and that\r\nkind of refuse that we rather uneuphoniously call \"muck.\" Such boxes to\r\nbe taken away once a week and empty ones left in their stead. As a\r\ncorollary to this, forbid him, under penalties, to continue his present\r\npractice of pitching derelicts into the street, as the readiest means of\r\nbeing quit of them; and make him responsible for the cleanliness of his\r\ndoorsteps and the pavement in front of his dwelling.\r\n\r\n5. Send round carts of chloride of lime, at short intervals during warm\r\nor \"muggy\" weather, and direct a bucketful to be delivered to every\r\nhousewife, to remove stenches from sinks, water-closets, &c.\r\n\r\n6. Erect a furnace in some convenient locality, to serve the same\r\npurpose as that known as the \"Queen's tobacco-pipe\" at the London Docks\r\ndoes or did--_i.e._, to reduce to ashes all infected or condemned\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing list of recommendations might be extended indefinitely;\r\nbut perhaps the above will be sufficient to begin with.\r\n\r\nThere are, no doubt, two objections at least which may be raised against\r\nthe adoption of any scheme founded on these hints: first, one on the\r\nscore of increased expenditure; secondly, one condemning increased\r\ncentralization. With regard to the former, my answer is that health,\r\nespecially the health of the aggregate mass of the body politic, cannot\r\npossibly be bought too dear; and that nothing really is so costly to any\r\ncommunity as pestilence and death. As to the latter, I have no other\r\ndefence to urge than my firm conviction that, much as it is railed\r\nagainst, centralization is as nearly an unmixed good as it is possible\r\nfor anything in this sublunary (and marvellously complex) sphere to be.\r\nEverybody knows how inadequate the very best isolated efforts are to\r\nexterminate any widespread evil; and even organizations which are\r\nindependent of, and do not radiate from or gravitate to, a common\r\ncentre, frequently cross each other's paths, and to some extent defeat\r\neach other's purposes; occasioning a great waste of wholesome energy,\r\nwhich, well directed, might achieve marvellous results. As cosmos is\r\ngreater than chaos--as a well-spliced rope is stronger than its separate\r\nstrands--so is centralization and cohesion greater and stronger than\r\nindividualism and segregation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPocket.\r\n\r\nMany a vigorous arm has applied the axe to that dense and matted jungle,\r\nthe indigence of the lower orders; but little more has been accomplished\r\nthan the blunting of the hatchet and the exhaustion of the pioneer who\r\nwielded it.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, it would be the height of folly for me, with my far\r\nfeebler frame and my puny weapon, to attempt to do more than to peer\r\ncautiously around the deep shades, and try to find out, as a dweller\r\n_within_ those murky woods, if here a little path and there a little\r\nopening, into which a gleam of sunlight penetrates at times, be not\r\ndiscoverable, half hidden, perchance, by clumps of brushwood, which it\r\nwill cost but little trouble to clear away. I shall therefore restrict\r\nmyself to indicating such of these openings as I see, or fancy I see,\r\nfrom whence operations might, according to my notion, be directed\r\ntowards the demolition of portions at all events of this swart and\r\ngloomy forest.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest of these clearings is undoubtedly, I think,\r\n_Co-operation_, of which there are two kinds--viz., combinations between\r\nmasters and men in the shape of limited partnerships, a per-centage on\r\nprofits, &c.; and combinations amongst the wage-earners themselves for\r\ncertain specified purposes.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first named, I am rather inclined to doubt the\r\nprobability of its ever becoming an important factor in the sum of human\r\nprogress, on account of the unlikelihood of its being generally adopted\r\neither in the near or distant future, and I am still more sceptical as\r\nto its efficacy as a panacea, even if it were universally reduced to\r\npractice, especially in these days of commercial disasters.\r\n\r\nComing, then, to the other mode of co-operation--associations of manual\r\nworkers--this also divides itself into two branches, having two distinct\r\nobjects--namely, the receipt of higher wages for labour performed, and\r\nthe obtaining greater value in commodities in the disbursement of such\r\nwages. Both these are, no doubt, laudable aspirations; and, although at\r\nthe first glance they may appear incompatible with, if not altogether\r\nantagonistic to, each other,--inasmuch as increased remuneration to the\r\nproducer means an increase in the price of the thing produced,--yet it\r\nwill be seen, on mature reflection, that as a very large proportion of\r\noperatives are employed in the manufacture of articles of luxury, of\r\nwhich they are not consumers or purchasers, so much of the increase in\r\nthe price of such articles as finds its way into the pockets of the\r\nartificer in the shape of added wages is a net gain to that portion of\r\nthe labouring classes, and will inevitably exude from such portion to\r\nthe benefit of the whole, in the same manner as what may be called in\r\ncontradistinction their normal earnings.\r\n\r\nI should like to say one word about combinations of workmen in this\r\nplace, which may be distasteful to unqualified panegyrists of the\r\nsystem: such combinations should invariably be in accordance with our\r\nrecognized code of morals, and they must be in obedience to the ordinary\r\nlaws of Nature; and it is to be feared that these desiderata to\r\nperfection in co-operation have at times been lost sight of in the past.\r\nI am compelled to blush for my order when I find them seizing the\r\nopportunity of their employers being under a heavy time-contract for the\r\nexecution of important public or other works to organize a strike: this\r\nis clearly an infraction of all the ethics of morality. Neither can I\r\nappreciate their sense of the fitness of things when I hear them laying\r\nit down as a sound axiom that wages should be equalized, so that the\r\nstupid, idle, or inferior workman should be on a par with the skilled\r\nand industrious one. This is a blunder against one of the most immutable\r\nof Nature's laws--that of variety and infinite gradation; the suggestion\r\nimplies a yearning after the utterly unattainable, which it is\r\nastonishing men of otherwise sound judgment should seriously entertain\r\nfor one moment. As a comrade of mine pithily observed, not long since,\r\nwhen we were discussing the possibility of devising a scheme by which\r\nall men should receive the same amount of remuneration for their labour,\r\nand, when received, be enabled to make it go equally far--\"You might as\r\nwell try to make men all o' one height.\"\r\n\r\nRemove these excrescences from our combinations, and when it is found we\r\ncan be practical as well as earnest, co-operation will have acquired a\r\nnew vigour, and will be able to accomplish greater results. The main\r\ncitadel will be none the less impregnable because our forces are not\r\nscattered abroad in various directions, in the vain endeavour to\r\nstrengthen totally indefensible frontiers.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, it is from the other branch of co-operation--the\r\n_co-operative store system_--that the greatest advantages may be\r\nexpected to accrue. This is growing into favour yearly, still growing\r\n(despite recent diatribes in the newspapers), and is extending its\r\nramifications into quite primitive districts. The knowledge that this is\r\nan undoubted fact should afford gratification to the well-wishers of the\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nYet this gratification is subject to some modification when it is seen\r\nthat this, not the least important birth of the nineteenth century,\r\nthough growing and bearing within itself the germs of almost infinite\r\npossibilities, is at present of too tiny dimensions to grapple with that\r\ncolossal ogre--the wasteful expenditure of the impecunious. It is\r\nHercules indeed, but Hercules still in swaddling clothes before the\r\nstrangling of the serpent. The amount of dealings at these stores by the\r\nclass to whom they are calculated to prove the greatest boon, when\r\ncompared with dealings by this same class with _very_ retail shopkeepers\r\nand at other places where the practice of paying \"through the nose\"\r\n(pardon the vulgarity) so extensively prevails, will be found to be\r\nalmost infinitesimal. The question therefore arises, may it not be\r\npossible to replace these pine torches by Edisonian lights, so as to\r\neliminate from wider tracts the thick darkness enwrapping the minds of\r\nthe sons and daughters of toil as to what constitutes their true\r\ninterests? It appears to me that there is one way of rendering this\r\nfeasible, which I deferentially submit for consideration. It may be\r\nquite impracticable; and, if practicable, may contain such flaws as to\r\nbe futile. If so, on defects being pointed out which I am not able,\r\nunassisted, to discover, I can only say I am open to conviction. I have\r\nno desire to be charged with an ineradicable attachment to that peculiar\r\nfeat of horsemanship known as \"riding a hobby to death.\" My plan is\r\nsimply this: first, let every town of say over 10,000 inhabitants\r\npossess an internal government complete in itself, with plenary\r\nadministrative powers; let groups of villages, in such numbers as may be\r\ndetermined on (the present Poor-Law Union Divisions might be taken as a\r\nbasis), form cordons round themselves in like manner, and with the like\r\nobjects; let every care be taken to select the very best men of every\r\nsocial grade to form the local senate, and let the members of which it\r\nis composed be paid for their services out of the public (local) funds,\r\nbe subject to re-election at short intervals, and be required to give\r\ngood accounts of their stewardship. Further, let it be clearly\r\nunderstood that the only condition on which a man could hope to be\r\nenrolled in this representative band, or, being enrolled, expect to be\r\nallowed to continue his official existence, would be his distinct and\r\nunquestioning recognition of _personal_ responsibility, as far as is\r\nhumanly possible, for, and his unwavering resolution to secure, the\r\nwell-being of _all_ his constituents, physically, pecuniarily, mentally,\r\nand morally.\r\n\r\nThese preliminaries being supposed to be satisfactorily settled, such\r\nincorporation or assembly of chosen ones might (always supposing my\r\nviews happened to find favour in their sight) open as many co-operative\r\nstores--so many for each trade--as would be sufficient to supply the\r\nneeds of the entire community, selecting competent men from each trade\r\nto manage the different departments, and paying them by an agreed salary\r\nin the same manner as rate collectors and relieving officers are paid. A\r\ncertain specified per-centage to be added to the prime cost of the\r\nvarious articles to defray the estimated expenses of management,\r\nadvertising, rent (if necessary, though it would be better if the local\r\nlegislators were also the landlords), wear and tear, depreciation in\r\nstock, and miscellaneous expenses for the year; and sales to be made to\r\nthe consumer _for cash only_. The urban or rural chancellor of the\r\nexchequer would, in his annual budget, soon learn to adjust the amount\r\nof his tax (for so the per-centage may be considered), over and above\r\nthe original cost price, according to the probable exigencies of the\r\nensuing year, by the light afforded by the transactions of the preceding\r\none.\r\n\r\nSeeing how many millions of pounds are annually disbursed for the barest\r\nsustenance and most absolute necessaries of life by the poor of the\r\nthree kingdoms, from most of whom exorbitant rates of profit are\r\nwrung,--for the fact need not be expatiated on here that the more\r\nindigent the purchaser, and the more his penury drives him to live from\r\nhand-to-mouth, the less value he receives for his money, to say nothing\r\nof the further irruptions made into his income by the only\r\npartially-slain \"truck system,\" or by the payment of interest to the\r\naccommodating successors of the Lombards, whose golden balls proclaim\r\nthem to serve the honourable office of jackal-purveyors to the lions of\r\nthe gin-palaces,--seeing this, I say, shall I be stigmatized as a\r\ndreamer, a half-crazy Utopian, if I anticipate magnificent results to\r\nfollow from fair trial of a scheme designed to stem the frightful\r\ntorrent of improvidence at present obtaining amongst the working\r\nclasses, and to enable them to occupy the new position of being\r\nparticipators in the benefits of a sound commercial undertaking?\r\n\r\nHere, however, as elsewhere, there are tares amongst the wheat--if,\r\nindeed, it be wheat. An awkward inquiry obtrudes itself unbidden. What\r\nis to become of the thousands of deserving folks, too old for the most\r\npart to begin life _de novo_, who have earned a tolerably honest\r\nlivelihood as small shopkeepers, and who would probably find themselves,\r\nunder the system just recommended, \"improved off the face of the earth?\"\r\nPartially the difficulty might be met by the employment of the most\r\nactive or most experienced of them in the borough stores. A little more\r\nmight be accomplished in this direction also by giving some of them\r\nappointments to the numerous new offices it will be found necessary to\r\ncreate if our municipal authorities ever do wake up and bestir\r\nthemselves, and aspire to becoming something more suitable to the spirit\r\nof the age than mere assemblies for palaver. But when all this is done,\r\nthere will still be the residuum, and that residuum composed almost\r\nexclusively of the feeble, the aged, the halt, the lame, and the blind,\r\nwho will be more or less thrown upon their own resources. For these, the\r\nonly gleam of light I can discern is the fact that a remnant of their\r\nold customers will not find out all at once the error of their ways, and\r\nwill go on in their accustomed grooves for some time after the\r\ncentralized co-operative store shall have become _un fait accompli_, and\r\nso their decline into pauperism will be slow and gradual. Heaven only\r\nknows how some of these small shopkeepers contrive to exist even now by\r\nvending pennyworths and halfpennyworths of this, that, and the other; it\r\ncan only be by imposing extravagant profits on the article vended. One\r\ncannot help thinking that their case can hardly very well be worse than\r\nit is, in any event. But be this as it may, care for their particular\r\ninterests must not be permitted to dominate over due consideration for\r\nthose of the vast aggregate mass forming the rest of our _clientèle_,\r\ninnumerable as \"leaves in Vallambrosa,\"--and, like other and greater\r\nfolks, superfluous retailers must submit to be sacrificed for the\r\nbenefit of the common weal.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to deal even in the most cursory manner with this\r\n\"pocket\" question without just glancing at the important bearing which\r\nthe question of temperance must exercise upon it. To place a further\r\nspending power in the hands of an incurably intemperate populace would\r\nobviously mean only to increase and intensify the vice of intemperance.\r\nWhile deprecating any intention of making this paper the vehicle for a\r\nfurious tirade against drunkenness, I feel bound to say in passing that,\r\nlittle as I love total abstinence, I regard it as a much lesser evil\r\nthan the unrestrained indulgence of dipsomania; and if any man feels\r\nthat he is so much a slave to his degraded appetite that he cannot keep\r\nup a nodding acquaintance with John Barleycorn without wallowing under\r\nhis influence in the mud of inebriety, I respect that man for signing\r\nthe pledge. My optimist instincts, however, buoy me up again on this\r\nsubject also, for I sincerely believe that, high authority for the\r\nassertion though there be, mankind are _not_ mostly fools; and that when\r\nthey have begun to realize the fact that they have a choice as to the\r\nkind of investment they may obtain for their money, the great majority\r\nof them will be looking out for some more substantial advantage than the\r\nquestionable luxury of seeking temporary oblivion from carking cares and\r\nthe grisly spectre of hopeless indigence. It may, I think, be relied on\r\nwith certainty that an improvement in the pecuniary circumstances of the\r\npoor would beget increased self-respect, and self-respect would proclaim\r\ndrunkenness _unfashionable_, and that now vigorous and lusty giant would\r\nere long find himself as decrepit and infirm as Bunyan's Giant Pope.\r\nThose of us who have read of the bacchanalian orgies of the great no\r\nfurther back than the days of the Regency of George IV., and contrast it\r\nwith the sobriety which is said to prevail amongst them in our days,\r\ncannot be accused of being groundlessly sanguine if we augur the\r\npercolation downwards of this stream of moderation under happier\r\nauspices, and that, too, in no remote future.\r\n\r\nA third means of lightening the strain upon our _ouvriers_ is to\r\nmultiply the facilities for emigration. I would even go so far as to say\r\nthat I think an _International_ Emigration and Immigration League\r\nbetween all the civilized nations of the world, for the purpose of\r\ndrafting overplus populations into thinly inhabited districts, would be\r\nrather a good thing than otherwise, the inconveniences attending\r\ndifferences of language, manners, and so forth, being quite\r\nsurmountable; whereas the difficulties attendant upon the possession of\r\nmore hands to labour than there is work to perform, and consequently\r\nmore hungry stomachs than there is food to fill, is altogether\r\ninsurmountable. With regard to the affliction of _mal du pays_, from\r\nwhich undoubtedly many of the expatriated would suffer at intervals,\r\nthat would be found to be a much more tolerable burden to bear, combined\r\nwith a sufficiency of victuals and clothing, than the pangs of\r\nstarvation or semi-starvation even on one's \"native heather.\"\r\n\r\nBut as it is no part of my programme to move too fast, or too far at\r\nonce, I do not insist upon any international arrangement of the kind I\r\nhave hinted at during, say, the present decade. I do, however, earnestly\r\nentreat all whom it may concern to try their best to place the matter of\r\nEmigration on a proper footing. I unhesitatingly maintain that whilst\r\nGreat Britain possesses untold thousands of acres of virgin soil, and\r\npractically unlimited untried possibilities, in her numerous colonies,\r\nthis our \"sea-girt isle\" ought not to suffer from a plethora of willing\r\nworkers. The existing facilities held out to our overcrowded populations\r\nto induce them to venture upon \"fresh fields and pastures new\" might be\r\nmultiplied a hundred-fold.\r\n\r\nSurely it ought to be part of the fundamental policy of a\r\nState--especially of a State whose real governing body is elected by\r\nhousehold suffrage--to take the most active measures for insuring the\r\nweal of all its citizens: the humblest as well as the highest. Does not\r\nthis, indeed, form the very quintessential attribute of good government?\r\nHas it not been rightly said that a State represents the totality of all\r\nthe individuals composing it? I assume these are sound political axioms;\r\nand if I am right in this assumption, may I not suggest, as the most\r\ncertain way of attaining the desired end, that our Representative\r\nGovernment should formally acknowledge our claims upon them by\r\nappointing a Minister for \"the Condition of the People,\" with a seat in\r\nthe Cabinet? The next step would be easy, for when once the whole\r\nsurroundings were fairly brought within the range of vision, the vital\r\nimportance of Emigration as a principal means of amelioration would be\r\nrecognized; and it would be discovered that an able Secretary for\r\nEmigration would prove an invaluable auxiliary in the effective working\r\nof the department.\r\n\r\nIt would be necessary, I apprehend, to select for this latter office a\r\nman eminent as well for good temper as for a capacious intellect, as the\r\nmultiplicity of the functions he would have to perform would render such\r\noffice by no means a sinecure; and the involved and complex matters he\r\nwould have to deal with might, at times, go far in the direction of\r\nruffling the serenest imperturbability.\r\n\r\nThe eye of fancy depicts him in the active performance of his\r\nmultifarious duties, surrounded by numerous painstaking subordinates,\r\nsome of whom bear to him huge tomes, containing a full alphabetical list\r\n(compiled from the census returns and other sources) of the populations,\r\nindustries, and assessments of the United Kingdom, divided into areas of\r\ncertain dimensions, showing the age, sex, occupation, and earnings or\r\nincomings of every person; the number of houses (with their rentals or\r\nestimated yearly value), workshops, or other business establishments of\r\nevery kind, specifying how many hands are employed in each and the\r\namount of wages paid; and also showing the number of persons in receipt\r\nof out-door relief, and approximate number of vagrants in each district.\r\nOther attentive satellites open before him the various domesday books,\r\ncontaining reports by competent surveyors as to the quantity, and the\r\nlatent riches or irredeemable poverty, of uncultivated lands throughout\r\nthose vast dominions of ours on which the sun never sets; with copious\r\nnotes by skilled mercantile men and geographers, pointing out the places\r\nwhere commodious ports might be formed, railways constructed, or\r\nmanufactories erected. Our much-worried Secretary, whose heart is in his\r\nwork, compares notes, and directs some of his chief clerks to prepare\r\ndigests of, for instance, the information contained in pp. 420 to 446 of\r\nthe 17th volume of the first set of books, and pp. 97 to 104 of the 32nd\r\nvolume of the second set, ready for his consideration on the day but one\r\nfollowing. He then takes up similar digests, which have previously been\r\nprepared in like manner, and sees clearly that one hundred artisan\r\nfamilies of various specified trades, full particulars of which are\r\nbefore him, may, with advantage to all parties, be transplanted, passage\r\nfree, from the blind alleys of Flintchester to the new settlement of\r\nHornihand in Australasia, with the authorities of which place the usual\r\narrangement will be made to assist them on their _début_, and lend them\r\na helping hand until they get fairly settled down. Day after day this\r\nkind of thing goes on throughout the year, except for some two months\r\nduring the late summer and autumn vacation, when the hard-worked\r\nSecretary and his staff are enjoying a well-earned holiday.\r\n\r\nThe more I ruminate on this matter of Emigration the more I am convinced\r\nthat it is indispensable; it should run on wider lines, and cover a far\r\nmore extended area than is possible under anything short of Governmental\r\nintervention. Seeing the utter inutility and inefficacy of isolated\r\nexertions to deal with the mighty problems which our complex\r\ncivilization presents for solution, I should, on behalf of myself and my\r\nclass, hail with joy the prospect of State interference in our\r\ninterests. Sneers may continue to be directed against, and witty\r\nsarcasms levelled at, a \"Paternal Government,\" \"infringement of that\r\nliberty of the subject which is the inherent privilege and birthright of\r\nevery Briton,\" and other like cuckoo-cries. But meantime we starve; we\r\nincrease and multiply in obedience to the law of Nature, and our\r\nopportunities of earning subsistence do _not_ increase and multiply in a\r\ncorresponding ratio. And without by any means desiring to steep my pen\r\nin midnight blackness in order to portray possible portentous\r\nconsequences, yet it is a proposition not to be controverted that the\r\never-increasing preponderance of born toilers over any quantity of\r\nremunerative toil which can by any possibility be created within the\r\nlimits of Great Britain proper must inevitably cause such consequences\r\nto be calamitous. For some time past the dark shadow of over-population\r\nhas been looming on the horizon of \"Merrie England,\" at first no bigger\r\nthan a man's hand, but later advancing nearer and still more near and\r\nassuming colossal proportions; and the time cannot be far distant when\r\nit will obstinately refuse to be ignored any longer, even by the most\r\nunreflective, but will assert itself in a manner little to be desired.\r\nHow, then, to avert this evil? How to postpone the advent of the fateful\r\nday? Are not these queries of vital interest to all ranks of society? I\r\nfor one feel them to be so: hence the above gropings after gleams of\r\ndaylight in the midst of the gathering shades. I do not pretend to aver\r\nthat I have found the sunshine, that I have discovered an absolute cure\r\nfor all the ills that \"flesh is heir to.\" Too well I know what mistakes\r\nand blunders are interwoven in the best-devised schemes of human origin.\r\nNevertheless, I hold that the free expression and ventilation of\r\nopinions, even though they may be erroneous, is often eventually\r\nproductive of good, by serving to dispel vagueness of thought and loose\r\ngeneralization, and solidifying the abstract into the concrete; until\r\nwhich process has been accomplished no thing soever can be dealt with\r\nsatisfactorily. Therefore, as a firm _dis_believer in the Malthusian\r\nphilosophy, as also in the recommendations for checking the increase of\r\npopulation more recently scattered broadcast amongst us, and being\r\ndeeply impressed with the imperative necessity of confronting the\r\ndifficulty at once--_now_, in these days when the heavens above us\r\nappear to be hardening into brass, and the earth beneath us to be\r\ncorrugating into iron--I have requested the Editor of this REVIEW to\r\nafford me the opportunity of giving publicity to my views.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to this division of my paper, if not actually of it, is\r\nthe subject of _Charity_. Here, again, what a lamentable waste of vital\r\nforce, what an invertebrate entity crying aloud to be overhauled,\r\nremodelled, jointed, and braced! Contrast the grand sum total yearly\r\ngiven in charity with the paucity of definite results attained--the\r\nwell-worn comparison of the Nasmyth hammer and the nut instantaneously\r\nrecurs to one's mind. Except when subscriptions are raised for some\r\nspecific object outside the usual round altogether, how little there is\r\nto show for the expenditure! Why is this so? And what is the remedy?\r\nObviously, I opine, the cause is individualism, isolation, caprice,--and\r\nas obviously, I ween, the only cure is combination, organization,\r\nsystem. Where we have now hundreds of little benevolent societies, with\r\ntheir honorary secretaries and treasurers and fussy committees, each\r\nneutralizing the others, let us have two or three established on a broad\r\nbasis, with a central committee who, when the \"sinews of war\" are\r\ncollected in one focus, will be strong enough to enter on paths at\r\npresent untrodden, and wise enough to understand that almost innumerable\r\ndifferentiations in the nature of gifts will be necessary to cope\r\nsuccessfully with the almost illimitable diversities in the nature of\r\nrequirements, and who will insist on being invested with discretionary\r\npowers in matters of occasional aids and supplemental benevolences. Then\r\nit will be no longer possible for the shameless pauper, flaunting his\r\nrags and sores in the marketplace, or the whining sycophantic hypocrite,\r\nto monopolize the coals of one society, the blankets of a second, the\r\nsoup of a third, and so on _ad infinitum_, not seldom exchanged for\r\nmeans of procuring beer to give additional zest to the utterance of the\r\nsentiment--\"What fools these gentlefolks be.\" The most searching\r\ninquiries would be instituted, and perchance succour afforded to those\r\nto whom it would prove an inestimable boon, but who, from constitutional\r\ntimidity or _mauvaise honte_, now starve and drop and die in silence,\r\noverlooked by almoners who take the first miserable-looking object who\r\ncomes to hand, the most self-asserting or the most \"'umble,\" and\r\nstraightway pour out the contents of their cornucopias upon shams,\r\nmaking a miserable travesty of the sacred name of Charity.\r\n\r\n\r\nMind.\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to know that so far as this branch of the subject is\r\nconcerned, our governors, having by the force of circumstances been\r\ncompelled to realize the fact of our existence, and our claim to be\r\nconsidered as veritably part and parcel of the body politic, with rights\r\nof common citizenship, have further, within the last few years, by the\r\npassing of the Compulsory Education Act, shown themselves possessed of\r\npolitical sagacity, by thus taking steps to insure that our descendants,\r\nwhen their turn comes to exercise and enjoy the civil privileges now\r\ngranted to them, shall at least have a ploughed and manured soil in\r\nwhich to sow the seeds of love for law and order with some chance of due\r\nfructification, instead of the rough, hibbly-hobbly cinder-heap of their\r\nforefathers, which acknowledged no fertilizing influence but gross\r\nbribery, and partially justified the political ostracism and exclusion\r\nof its owners from all share in electoral privileges.\r\n\r\nAll hail, then, to the School Board system as a great step in the right\r\ndirection. Undeniably true as are some of the accusations brought\r\nagainst it, alleging that many blunders and useless extravagances, and\r\nmuch disregard for the susceptibilities of well-meaning but mistaken\r\nopponents, have marked its progress onward in too many instances; yet as\r\nthe general idea is laudable and eminently conducive to promoting the\r\nhighest interests of the entire population, and as in the nature of\r\nthings it may be expected that greater experience will bring greater\r\nwisdom, and the faults charged against the movement gradually become\r\n\"small by degrees and beautifully less,\" let us heartily wish it\r\nGod-speed.\r\n\r\nYet, why does the good work stop here? Why should not provision be made\r\nfor building upon the foundation thus laid? Why should totally unformed\r\nintelligences be the only ones to profit by this guardian care, and why\r\nshould they be led a little way on the road and then left to flounder\r\nalong by themselves, and lose themselves in interminable mazes? Why, in\r\nshort, should education be confined to children, and not extended to\r\nadults?\r\n\r\nIt is true that the University Extension Scheme, as now carried out in\r\nmany of our larger provincial towns to a very, very limited and only\r\nfaintly appreciable extent, tends to show that the wind is just\r\nbeginning to blow in this direction also. Something, however, much more\r\ncomprehensive is needed. The masses are not reached, as will be patent\r\nto any one who will take the trouble to attend any of the courses of\r\nlectures delivered in connection with this extension system. The\r\nneophytes seeking initiation into this or that special branch of\r\nlearning will be found to be composed principally of what we call\r\n\"better class\" people, with a sprinkling of pupil teachers and sucking\r\ngovernesses.\r\n\r\nNor is this the fault of the masses themselves, as may perhaps be\r\nconjectured; the mere circumstance of the prices charged for admission\r\nin itself forming an insuperable barrier to the great majority having\r\nany part or lot in the matter, to say nothing of the fact that the whole\r\napparatus is professedly set in motion for the benefit of the\r\nmiddle-class public solely.\r\n\r\nBut however inadequate this minute increase in the volume of the\r\nfertilizing waters of Literature and Science may be for the mighty task\r\nof irrigating the parched and arid desert which stretches out in\r\nmeasureless extent before us, yet I am fain to regard it as a favourable\r\nomen--as a symptomatic indication that the \"fountains of the great\r\ndeeps\" of human ignorance are beginning to be broken up, and that the\r\ntide _is_ rising which, when it has reached its full height, will\r\ndisseminate the fruits of the Tree of Knowledge far and wide over the\r\nlandscape so that the lowly equally with the high-born may pluck and eat\r\nthereof. The monster Cerberus has received a buffet on one of its three\r\nheads, and the Hesperidean Gardens may ere long, I am sanguine enough to\r\nhope, be entered by any thirsty passer-by without fear of molestation.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, is dreamy, unsubstantial verbiage. That it is not\r\nalso mere chimerical nonsense, which will not bear the strain of\r\npractical application, I will attempt to show--always supposing as a\r\nnecessary preliminary, as in all the hypothetical propositions\r\nthroughout this paper, that that portion of the community who are nursed\r\nin the lap of fortune are imbued with sympathetic feelings towards the\r\nless favoured sharers of their common humanity, and do not object to\r\ntake a little trouble and bear a little charge by way of displaying\r\ntheir fellow-feeling.\r\n\r\nGrant this premiss, and what follows, or something better, may easily be\r\nrendered an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nThe first step will be the formation of a council or committee, after\r\nthe manner before suggested, save that in this case we shall want an\r\ninfusion of men of culture who at the same time shall be good workers\r\nand good philanthropists (a rare combination, but not an impossible one,\r\nI venture to think, notwithstanding the seductions a life of Sybaritic\r\nease and delicate refinement specially offers to the scholar), in every\r\nconsiderable town or group of villages throughout the length and breadth\r\nof the land, with power over the district purse-strings, and with no\r\nsuperior authority except the Minister or Secretary of State for\r\nEducation at Whitehall--for, of course, such a functionary will in those\r\nhappy times be quite as much a necessity as a Master of the\r\nBuckhounds--who alone will have power to veto their proceedings and\r\nissue general rules for their guidance.\r\n\r\nIf I had the ear of this all-important official, I should whisper to him\r\nthat in my view the best mode of enlightening the working classes would\r\nbe to take possession of three already-existing institutions, and\r\nenlarge their dimensions so as to make of them real forces, distinctly\r\nvisible, instead of the hole-and-corner obscure trivialities they are\r\nnow. These three institutions are--1st, Free Libraries; 2nd, Lecture\r\nHalls; 3rd, Class Rooms.\r\n\r\n1. To Free Libraries I have accorded the first place, because in all\r\nprobability it is there that the beneficial results will be more\r\nimmediately apparent, and the advantages offered will, in the first\r\ninstance, be most considerably made use of. The major portion of the\r\nhuge and unwieldy mass to be operated on would fly off at a tangent from\r\nthe exactness and method necessarily incident to formal lectures, and in\r\na still greater degree to class-work. It must first be left to itself to\r\nsprawl and struggle at its own free-will; the restraining chain must not\r\nbe too soon brought into view; gradually and insensibly the quickening\r\ninfluence must be brought to bear; the change from density to\r\nclear-headedness, from sluggish inertness to mental activity, will not\r\nbe effected in a moment; not all at once will the spiritual part of the\r\nlong-benighted assert its claim to an equality with the animal part;\r\ndesultory reading only will impart a love for reading; odd waifs and\r\nstrays of information picked up just anyhow will alone create the desire\r\nfor the acquisition of further knowledge, and by imperceptible degrees\r\nthe naturally well-regulated mind will reject vagueness and demand\r\nexactness; having reached which stage it will be fit to undergo the\r\nfurther regimen prescribed. A good starting-point, however, will have\r\nbeen gained when our operatives generally are imbued with a genuine love\r\nof books and obtain a somewhat varied, if superficial, knowledge anent\r\nthe salient features of English literature.\r\n\r\nThese words, \"_English_ literature,\" are used advisedly; for while I\r\nwould have every town of over 5000 inhabitants possessed of a Free\r\nLibrary (varying in size according to the population), and every village\r\nhave its book-loan society, it would be well to insist on the greatest\r\nand best of our own writers being well represented upon the shelves of\r\nevery institution of this character before venturing on translations\r\neither of the ancient classics or modern foreign authors, even of\r\nEuropean reputation. Homer, Thucydides, Æschylus, Plato, Virgil, and the\r\nrest, as well as Dante, Cervantes, Goethe, and the innumerable host of\r\nContinental immortals, can very well wait a bit. We want to inspire\r\n_British_ operatives with a love of letters. In endeavouring to effect\r\nthis, shall we not give the foremost place to the productions of\r\n_British_ genius? We have to _form_ a taste. Is it not desirable that,\r\nto begin with at all events, this should be a _national_ taste? But is\r\nnot this the very way, it may be asked, to foster insular prejudices,\r\nnarrowness, and bigotry? I reply, not necessarily, as many of our ablest\r\n_littérateurs_ have not hesitated to attack the various abuses, follies,\r\nand weaknesses which crop up in these islands from time to time--some\r\nhurling denunciations at them aglow with all the fervour of passion and\r\nintellect; others piercing them with the sharp spear of satire; and\r\nothers yet again calmly but pitilessly holding them up to contempt in a\r\ntrain of close reasoning. Many, too, in addition to lashing the vices\r\npeculiar to their native country, have, in terms of generous eloquence,\r\neulogized the virtues of our neighbours. Therefore, the man who is\r\ndisposed to wrap himself up in a mantle of national self-glorification\r\nand self-righteousness will not find that the hierarchs of our national\r\nliterature are at all times compliant enough to fasten the clasp for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut I have a further answer--_i.e._, independently altogether of the\r\nquestion whether the perusal of English works solely will or will not\r\nhave a tendency to nip the growing flower of cosmopolitanism in the bud,\r\nthe one essential point in training the English subject to think is to\r\ntrain him to think in his own vernacular--to show him of what mighty\r\nthings his mother-tongue is capable, and to satisfy him that\r\n\r\n    \"Age cannot weary, nor custom stale\r\n    Its infinite variety;\"\r\n\r\nand that if ever he, individually, wants to raise up his voice and make\r\nhimself heard on any subject that interests him or his fellows, he must\r\nnot fritter away his attention on more distant objects, but concentrate\r\nhis gaze on those which immediately surround him.\r\n\r\nThis view may appear somewhat contradictory to the one expressed when\r\ndealing with the subject of Emigration; but really it is not so. The\r\nleaving behind the special spot of earth where one drew one's first\r\nbreath, played as a boy, saw his first sweetheart, and grew up to\r\nmanhood, the parting from old friends and long-familiar objects, may\r\nand does entail a severe struggle, and inflict many a bitter pang; but\r\nit is unavoidable, and so must be submitted to. It is otherwise with\r\nhome ideas, habits, modes of thought, literature. These will serve to\r\nmitigate the poignancy of separation from one's native land, will\r\nintertwine themselves more closely round one's affections by reason of\r\nthat very separation, and be the means of causing miniature Englands to\r\narise in far-off regions, and in various degrees of latitude and\r\nlongitude. While releasing as cheerfully as may be what we _must_ let\r\ngo, let us hug more closely still that which we _can_ retain.\r\n\r\nTo return: In a well-equipped Free Library no standard British author\r\nshould be conspicuous by his absence. The poets, from Chaucer and Gower\r\nto Tennyson and Browning; the dramatists, from Marlowe and Shakspeare to\r\nW. S. Gilbert and Tom Taylor; the _modern_ historians, from Hume and\r\nGibbon to Froude and Freeman; the modern theologians, from Hooker and\r\nJeremy Taylor to Canon Farrar and the Dean of Westminster; the modern\r\nessayists, from the projectors of the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_ to the\r\ncontributors to the current Reviews and Magazines; the philosophers, the\r\nleaders in all departments of science, should be there; the best writers\r\nof prose fiction, also, from Fielding and Goldsmith to Trollope and\r\nGeorge Eliot, should be well represented. The most profound and the most\r\nvolatile will alike find sufficient to occupy their attention here for\r\nsome time. The \"Anglican paddock\" (to misapply a now well-known term)\r\nwill afford plenty of grazing ground to cattle of moderate appetites for\r\na considerable period; and when it is exhausted, why, then, there are\r\ntoothsome grasses in endless profusion to be cropped over the boundary\r\nfence.\r\n\r\n2. With reference to Lecture Halls, these ought to be nearly as\r\nplentiful as churches both in town and country, and can with proper\r\nmanagement be made to serve two ends--the carrying forward the work\r\nbegun at the Free Library, and the rousing from torpidity those whom\r\neven that useful institution would fail to reach; for as many would only\r\nbe led to attend the lecture through the library, so there are many with\r\nwhom the contrary would hold good, as many a dormant, beer-sodden soul\r\nwould consent to be carried off for an hour or two to a lecture hall who\r\ncould never be persuaded to sit down in cold blood to the perusal of a\r\nbook, although such book might be written in the most fascinating and\r\nbrilliant style imaginable: the unused eyes would soon begin to ache,\r\nthe palsied brain soon begin to numb; whereas the speaker, if a good\r\none, and his heart in his subject, would contrive to rivet the man's\r\nattention, despite of himself, by the magnetism of enthusiasm, and he\r\nwould carry away with him some sort of idea--muddled and distorted\r\nprobably, but still an _idea_--of what it was all about.\r\n\r\nPenny Readings interspersed with music have been very much derided by\r\nour erudite critics, I think without sufficient cause. These really\r\nharmless, if not very high-class gatherings, blending together the\r\ningredients of a certain kind of instruction and of entertainment, were\r\ndoubtlessly called forth by a genuine desire to familiarize the lower\r\norders of the people with some of the more dramatic passages in our\r\nliterature, and to render visible to them a higher intellectual standard\r\nthan the tap-room and the music-hall had made them acquainted with. It\r\nwas a happy thought to mingle singing and playing with the readings. The\r\nintroduction of these not only served to take off a possible monotony\r\nwhich might otherwise have been felt, but added attractions really\r\nelevating in their influence, the status and general surroundings of the\r\nauditory being taken into consideration. There is no need to pry too\r\ncuriously into the petty vanities which prompted this elocutionist or\r\nthat vocalist to make an appearance in public, nor to speculate too\r\nclosely upon the disproportion between the ludicrous extravagance of the\r\nefforts often made by incompetent aspirants to obtain fame, and the very\r\nmodest modicum and evanescent character of that article vouchsafed in\r\nreturn. All this is nothing to the purpose. The simple query is,--Have\r\nthese things, known as \"Penny Readings,\" in ever so slight a degree,\r\nfulfilled the object of their existence as that object is generally\r\nunderstood? If an affirmative answer can be given (as I certainly\r\nbelieve it can) to that question, then are they entitled to honest\r\npraise, and not to supercilious contempt.\r\n\r\nHowever, having deposited my little offering at this humble shrine as I\r\npassed by, I am free to confess that if we never get any further than\r\nthis on the road towards the mental improvement of the million, the\r\nmarch of intellect will be a very short march indeed. But it will\r\nnot--it cannot stop here. The universal law of progress forbids the\r\nidea; and in some form or another the irresistible impetus to advance\r\nwill be felt and obeyed.\r\n\r\nMeantime, no better means, so far as I see, appearing for the moment to\r\nbe available, I fall back upon my pet project of lectures, to be\r\ndelivered every night (Sundays excepted) from the middle of September to\r\nthe middle of May in every year, in every one of the multitudinous halls\r\nbuilt for the purpose, by men or women well versed in the several\r\nsubjects upon which they discourse.\r\n\r\nFailing the possibility of procuring a sufficient number of lecturers\r\nwho could spare the time necessary to compose original matter for the\r\npurpose, it would be by no means a bad plan, I think, to employ good and\r\nexperienced hands to condense and compress standard works on different\r\nsubjects into such a compass as to occupy two or three evenings, and\r\nhand these digests over to practised elocutionists to be _read_. Take\r\nhistory, for example. Prescott's \"Conquests of Mexico and Peru,\"\r\nMotley's \"Rise of the Dutch Republic,\" Irving's \"Conquest of Granada,\"\r\nCarlyle's \"French Revolution,\" or Hepworth Dixon's \"Her Majesty's\r\nTower,\" are peculiarly well adapted to undergo this process. The\r\nabsorbing interest of the incidents described could not fail to engage\r\nthe attention of the audience; and I cannot help thinking that the\r\noffended _manes_ of such of the above-named great ones as have departed\r\nfrom amongst us would be appeased when it was represented to them that\r\nthis mutilation of their invaluable legacies to posterity had been\r\nconducted with due reverence, and solely for the purpose of introducing\r\nthem to a far wider (and, perchance, not less appreciative) audience\r\nthan even their exalted talents could otherwise have commanded. As to\r\nthe still-living ones, perhaps before taking the liberty suggested with\r\ntheir literary offspring, it might be courteous to ask their permission,\r\nand I feel confident they would not be churlish enough to withhold it. I\r\nmay be reminded that there would still be publishers and owners of\r\ncopyright to be dealt with; but I leave suggestions as to the best means\r\nof negotiating with these awful entities to persons of greater\r\nexperience than myself.\r\n\r\nObviously this lecture-hall business, like most of my other theories,\r\nnecessarily involves considerable expenditure; but if anything is to be\r\ndone, opulence must feel for indigence not only in heart but in pocket.\r\n\r\n3. A thorough and unstinted employment of the means above indicated will\r\naccomplish much towards the emancipation of our helots from that\r\nthraldom of ignorance which gives to the more galling thraldom of caste\r\nits sole _raison d'être_. But there is yet one thing needed, the\r\n_utilization_ of knowledge acquired, and this can only be attained by\r\ndint of laborious and unintermitting class-work. The sacred flame may be\r\nkindled in the breast by desultory and omnivorous reading, but the light\r\nemitted is as uncertain as that of a wandering marsh-fire--it wants\r\n_focussing_ to be of any use to its possessor or his species. And it is\r\nin the _class_, under the guidance of a gifted and genial teacher, that\r\nthis operation can best be performed. It is here that the finishing\r\ntouch must be applied; here the rounding-off take place; here the\r\nheterogeneous be brought into homogeneity, and the discordant be reduced\r\nto harmony and system.\r\n\r\nIf these things are so, the problems which present themselves to be\r\nresolved are:--Given certain millions of untrained intellects in crying\r\nneed of class tuition scattered over certain thousands of square miles\r\nin unequal proportions--how to provide sufficient building accommodation\r\nto meet the exigencies of the case? and given an uncertain but\r\nconfessedly immense mass of torpidity and stagnation--how to infuse the\r\nnecessary leaven into it to quicken it and arouse its latent forces?\r\n\r\nI answer as to the first proposition--Require the architects of the\r\nmultitudinous lecture halls aforesaid to submit plans to you, which\r\nshall comprise sections not only of the main building but of three or\r\nfour adjuncts thereto suitable for class-rooms, after the style of the\r\nchapels nestling under the wings of our old cathedrals, or the annexes\r\nthrown out at convenient angles from our modern industrial exhibitions\r\nfor the display of specialities. These would add comparatively little to\r\nthe original cost of the structure, and save a great deal of time and\r\ntrouble in hunting up eligible sites, and, when found, negotiating terms\r\nof purchase. As to the second proposition, make a _liberal_ distribution\r\nof prizes part of your system, so liberal that not only proficiency\r\nwould be certain of obtaining a reward, but plodding and persevering\r\nmediocrity also. Constant attendance, combined with such written answers\r\nto questions as evinced that the pupil was making an effort, should,\r\nhowever imperfectly the answers were framed, insure the possession of a\r\nprize at the end of every session. With such materials to work upon, a\r\nfree use of stimulants to exertion must form no inconsiderable part of\r\nthe programme.\r\n\r\nAgain, no charge whatever must be made for admission to the classes.\r\nIndeed, the entire domain of adult poor education must be as free as\r\nUnited Italy--free from the Alps of the library to the Adriatic of the\r\nclass-room.\r\n\r\nLastly, no restriction should be made as to the age or sex of the\r\nscholar. I am of opinion that no greater incentive to emulation can be\r\noffered to either man or woman than the consciousness that they are\r\nassociated with co-workers or competitors of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nIt would be travelling out of the record were I ever so faintly to\r\nattempt to enter into details as to the mode in which class-teaching\r\ncould most advantageously be conducted, or to endeavour to shadow forth\r\nwhat I conceive to be the regulations best adapted for the purpose. No\r\ngeneral rules would be found competent to meet ever-varying special\r\nconditions. All this must inevitably be left to conform itself to the\r\npeculiarities of the respective groups of the taught and the\r\nidiosyncrasies of the individual teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmusements.\r\n\r\nOn this last, but not least, division of the subject, I need not dilate\r\nat very great length. Much has been written with reference to it of late\r\nwith which I cordially agree.\r\n\r\nNo one can help being sensible of the melancholy fact that the tendency\r\nof many of our so-called entertainments is debasing and degrading in the\r\nlast degree. It is difficult to imagine anything much more demoralizing\r\nin every aspect--anything which appears to be more utterly without\r\nredeeming features--than our music-halls. Dances, which are simply\r\nunnatural contortions on the part of the male performers, and indelicate\r\nexhibitions on the part of the female ones; songs, which are utterly\r\nidiotic and meaningless, except when their meaning is indecency,\r\nsounding the very lowest depths of imbecility, and having no literary\r\nmerit save _double entendres_ of the most vulgar description; the whole\r\ntaking place in an atmosphere redolent with the fumes of beer, gin, and\r\ntobacco,--such is the pabulum provided for our delectation through this\r\nparticular medium. Much the same poisonous mixture is administered at\r\nour tea-gardens and other places where we most do congregate. Is it a\r\nmarvel, then, that our young men waste their strength in drunkenness,\r\nand our young women stray from the narrow path? Is it wonderful that\r\nwhen you respectables meet us abroad on Bank Holidays, or Derby or Boat\r\nRace days, we comport ourselves in ruffianly fashion, and greet the ears\r\nof your dames and damsels with expressions which it is not good for them\r\nto hear?\r\n\r\nUltra-exclusives! those of you who are most deeply impressed with the\r\ndesirability of keeping us in our proper places, and are offended if we\r\npass \"between the wind and your nobility,\" to you most of all do I\r\naddress myself, and take the liberty of saying that on _you_ rests the\r\nonus of providing better and more healthy recreations for us; for needs\r\nmust that at times the most fastidious of you will find yourselves in\r\nthe midst of us, and it will interest you even more deeply than others\r\nthat we should not sink into unmitigated and universal rascaldom, the\r\nonly natural goal at which the pursuit of such pleasures as those\r\nabove-named is likely to land us. Give us attractions of a less baneful\r\ncharacter, and wean us from these cesspools of infamy. To you it is\r\nspecially important that this matter should receive attention. Do not,\r\nhowever, seek to do the work half-way; do not attempt to take away the\r\nmeans of recreation we have--evil as they are--until substitutes are\r\nfurnished; it will not be convenient to you that the people should have\r\ntoo much time to _brood_; it will be safer for you that we should be\r\n_mercurial_ rather than that we should be _morose_; in one mood or the\r\nother, however you may strive to ignore us, we shall continue to exist\r\nin tangible form and be distinctly visible to your perceptions.\r\n\r\nI like not threats or innuendoes, however, and say no more concerning\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\nTime was when holy-days were frequent, when gorgeous pageants feasted\r\nthe eyes of our forefathers--times of Maypoles and morrice-dancers, of\r\nroasted oxen and sheep, of conduits running with wine and milk: I say\r\nnot I wish these to return. Much I fear that all was not pure, pastoral,\r\nArcadian simplicity amidst these poetic scenes, fascinating as they are\r\nto the imagination. I doubt not the taint of vice was there, and the\r\nghastly presence of misery and sorrow, and I do not regret them--let\r\nthem go.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, do I suggest? Aware of the risk I run in having it imputed\r\nto me that my suggestions have already been too numerous, I will, with\r\nbrevity, venture yet one more.\r\n\r\nRepetition is vexatious; notwithstanding which, unification is\r\nimperative, and committees must again be called into requisition.\r\n\r\nCricket-clubs, quoit-clubs, bowling-clubs, even skittle-clubs _ad\r\nlibitum_, in summer; ballad concerts, dramatic performances, &c., in\r\nwinter, under the same auspices. Membership extended to all comers, fee\r\npayable one shilling per annum in monthly instalments; the expulsion or\r\nsuspension for a longer or shorter term--according to the more or less\r\nheinous nature of the offence--of any member for bad language,\r\nintoxication, or other misbehaviour; the gradual unbending of the rich\r\nand the cultured, and their condescending to grace the sports with their\r\noccasional presence, thereby infusing a spirit of refinement into them;\r\nthe prohibition of betting or _over_-drinking,--these are, shortly and\r\nimperfectly stated, the remedies I would suggest.\r\n\r\nTo conclude the whole matter. We, the industrious poor of this\r\nrealm--the hard-working classes--are in pressing need of help now, in\r\nthis present time. This, I believe, is confessed on all hands, diverse\r\nand contradictory as the theories how such help could best be given may\r\nbe. The question at issue is not whether ameliorations are desirable or\r\nthe contrary, but in what manner to bring them about, and how to be\r\ncertain that it is bread which is bestowed, and not a stone.\r\n\r\nI do not claim to have solved this enigma, or to have invented a\r\nmillennium. I simply assert my belief that some of my propositions may\r\ncontain germs capable of being nurtured into hopeful possibilities.\r\n\r\nAs I have selected four principal points in which improvements are\r\nrequired--health, pocket, mind, and amusements--so have I striven to\r\nindicate four principal modes which I think best calculated to attain\r\nthe desired end, and which for the most part must come from _without_\r\nour borders--namely, sympathy, earnestness, money, and centralized\r\norganization--all being essential; the last-named especially being so,\r\nfor it may be regarded as an irrefragable verity that every movement to\r\nbe really efficacious must be _national_, and not parochial.\r\n\r\nI look for many objections on both sides of the temperate zone, on the\r\nwaters of which alone I elect to voyage. The frigid will aver that I\r\nexpect too much, that my notions are Utopian and chimerical to the last\r\ndegree, and the nostrums prescribed empirical and baneful; that it is\r\nnot to be supposed sensible people will take all this trouble, and rush\r\ninto such reckless expenditure in a project so visionary. To such my\r\nonly answer is,--Where the return is to be great the investment must be\r\ngreat also. The torrid, on the other hand, will say I am not\r\nsufficiently thorough; that the only means of elevating the poor is by\r\nlugging the wealthy down to their level, abrogating dignities,\r\ndistributing riches, abolishing ownership in lands and corporeal\r\nhereditaments. To these my reply will be,--Evil will the day be which\r\nshall dawn on such devil's-sabbath employments as these. Levelling\r\n_up_wards is laudable; levelling _down_wards is execrable. I would in\r\nnowise interfere with the least of these institutions. The overthrow of\r\ndynasties will not advantage us, nor will a general scramble conduce to\r\nour lasting welfare. I am a sceptic as to the benefits to be derived\r\nfrom revolution, although professing myself a warm admirer of\r\nreformation, as I understand the word--_re_-formation.\r\n\r\nNeither do I anticipate that the time will ever come, under the best\r\ndevised systems, when poverty will altogether cease out of the land.\r\nEvil will there be, and good also, while the world stands. This,\r\nhowever, should be no excuse for indifferentism in the work of lessening\r\nthe sum-total of the evil, and increasing the sum-total of the good.\r\n\r\nAnd so Lazarus unmoors his fragile boat, and launches it, unmanned and\r\nuntended, on the bosom of the stream,--to meet its fate.\r\n\r\n    HENRY J. MILLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORMS AND COLOURS OF LIVING CREATURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Essay on Animals and Plants, which appeared in the September\r\nNumber of this Review, the names were given of the principal groups in\r\nwhich the prodigious multitude of living creatures (existing or known to\r\nhave existed) have been classified by naturalists. It was therein also\r\nindicated that these various groups, and all the subdivisions of such\r\ngroups, are distinguished one from another by variations in the forms\r\nand structures of the creatures which compose them. This fact alone\r\nwould prove that very many differences in form must exist; but, indeed,\r\na very slight knowledge and a very cursory examination of animals and\r\nplants would suffice to show this even to any one who knew nothing of\r\nthe scope or nature of biological classification. In truth, to the\r\nnon-scientific observer who feels an interest in living things, the\r\ndifficulty may seem to be rather how to find general resemblances than\r\nhow to detect differences between creatures which seem so totally\r\ndiverse as do humming birds from whales, bees from buffaloes, or the\r\nnumerous African herds of antelopes from the grasses on which they feed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was pointed out in the second Essay of this series[56]\r\nthat all living creatures do agree to a certain extent in the form and\r\nstructure of their bodies, inasmuch as their bodies are always bounded\r\nby curved lines and surfaces, while, if we divide the body of any animal\r\nor plant its structure may always be seen to be heterogeneous--that is\r\nto say, composed of different substances, even the simplest showing a\r\nvariety of minute particles (granules) variously distributed throughout\r\nits interior. It has also been pointed out[57] that all living creatures\r\nagree in beginning life in the form of a small rounded mass of\r\nprotoplasm. But all animals and plants further agree in that each kind\r\nhas its own proper size, shape, structure, and colour, and each (as we\r\nshall hereafter see) shows a positive unity in its fundamental\r\nconstitution, co-existing with the heterogeneity above referred to.\r\n\r\nBut though each kind has its own proper size, shape, structure, and\r\ncolour, yet these vary more or less in different individuals, and the\r\ndegrees of variability are different in different kinds both of animals\r\nand plants.\r\n\r\nAs to size, although most living creatures have certain limits which\r\nthey rarely exceed or fall below, yet many organisms vary greatly in\r\nthis respect. Thus, that familiar weed, the common centaury (_Erythræa\r\ncentaurium_), may vary in height--according to the soil and other\r\nexternal conditions--from half an inch to five feet.\r\n\r\nAs to figure and structure there is more constancy, and the amount of\r\nvariation which may in these respects be found between different\r\nindividuals of the same animal species, is generally but slight. In\r\nplants and in plant-like animals much greater differences exist as to\r\nexternal configuration; but even in them the internal structure of each\r\nspecies varies but little.\r\n\r\nColour is a character which some readers may be disposed to regard as\r\nextremely inconstant. We are familiar with many differently coloured\r\nvarieties of our cultivated flowers; and white blackbirds, and black\r\nleopards are not very uncommon objects. Nevertheless, colour is really a\r\ncharacter of much constancy, and is one not only constantly present in\r\ndifferent individuals of one kind of plant or animal, but is one\r\nconstantly present in particular groups of kinds.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, all the English plants of the dandelion order which\r\nhave opposite leaves, have yellow flowers, with the single exception of\r\nthe eupatory (_Eupatorium cannabinum_), and whole groups of butterflies\r\nare respectively characterized as being blue, or white, or yellow.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the life of every living being is accompanied by, and\r\nmay be described as, a series of adjustments of action and structure to\r\nexternal conditions which surround it. Accordingly we may expect to find\r\nthat the sizes, shapes, structures, and colours of living beings bear\r\nrelations, which are in very many cases obvious, to their external\r\ncircumstances, as directly favouring their nutrition, reproduction, or\r\npreservation from external injury.\r\n\r\nEvery living creature must be either fixed (like a rooted tree), or\r\ncapable of spontaneously moving, or of being passively drifted from\r\nplace to place, and must have a structure and figure suitable to one or\r\nother of these conditions.\r\n\r\nAgain, every living creature, whether free or fixed, is either a\r\nterrestrial, an aquatic, or an aërial organism; and it may be fitted to\r\nlive in any two, or even in all three of these conditions--as, for\r\nexample, is the swan. If terrestrial, it may inhabit the surface of the\r\nearth only, or it may occasionally or habitually dwell beneath it. The\r\nstructure, forms, and even colours of organisms are in most cases\r\nplainly adapted to their modes of life in the above respects.\r\n\r\nThus, any living creature, which is fixed to the surface of the earth,\r\nmust either adhere to it by having one side or portion of its body\r\nspread out and adjusted to irregularities in the supporting surface, or\r\nelse by sending prolongations of its substance into the substance of the\r\nsupporting body, as a plant sends its roots into the soil. Such\r\nprolongations, moreover, must (in order to hold fast) either sink deeply\r\nor else expand, at a slight depth, into a rounded or discoidal mass, or\r\ninto radiating processes whereby the whole structure may be securely\r\nanchored.\r\n\r\nThis special modification of form, again, may or may not be accompanied\r\nby certain further modifications of structure, according as such rooting\r\nparts are to serve, as mere holdfasts, simply for attachment, or (as in\r\nmost plants) for the absorption of food also.\r\n\r\nAnother modification is also correlated with these conditions. We have\r\nseen[58] that an interchange of gases takes place between each organism\r\nand its surrounding medium. But such interchange cannot take place in\r\nthe subterranean part of the body, and a corresponding difference of\r\nstructure between such subterranean part and other parts must therefore\r\nobtain.\r\n\r\nAgain, as to colour, we find differences which are evidently related to\r\nthe different degrees in which different parts of a living body are\r\nexposed to the influence of light. Such contrasts notoriously exist, not\r\nonly between the green parts of plants above the soil and the lighter\r\ncoloured roots, but between the foliage of a plant which is exposed to\r\nsun light and another of the same kind kept in a dark cellar. Many\r\nanimals which live in permanent darkness are colourless, as, _e.g._, the\r\n_Proteus_;[59] but yet this is not an invariable rule, some, as the\r\nmole, being of a dark colour.\r\n\r\nThe forms of organisms are evidently often directly related to\r\nsurrounding influences. A plant or plant-like animal fixed to the soil\r\nmay be so fixed that light, air, food, friends and enemies can have\r\naccess equally on all sides or not. Thus, a tree so placed that light\r\nand air are excluded on one side, will not grow freely towards that\r\nside, but only in directions from whence light and air have access. A\r\ncoral reef increases much more rapidly towards the open sea (the waves\r\nof which bring in food and facilitate gaseous interchange) than towards\r\nan adjacent shore.\r\n\r\nThe mere contiguity of parts will often affect the form of organisms.\r\nThus, in many flowers parts which are adjacent become dwarfed, while\r\nothers which are freely exposed become fully developed, as we see in the\r\nflowers of many _Umbelliferæ_, or plants of the parsley, fennel, and\r\nhemlock order.\r\n\r\nThe shapes of flowers bear relation (as we shall see later) to their\r\nneed for attracting insects which by their visits effect the development\r\nof seed, and for repelling others the access of which would be hurtful.\r\n\r\nThe avoidance of enemies may be so effected by an organism that their\r\naccess may be made impossible save in one direction, the extent of\r\nvulnerable surface even in that direction being minimized. We have an\r\nexample of such a condition in those worms which live in calcareous\r\ntubes, and which are some of those called \"tubicolous annelids.\"[60]\r\n\r\nAgain, the medium in which an organism lives--whether aërial or\r\naqueous--has an important relation with its form. A delicate seaweed,\r\nthe beautifully radiating form of which is a just object of admiration\r\nas long as it is supported by its denser natural medium (the sea water),\r\ncollapses into an amorphous mass when withdrawn thence into the thin\r\nair. Obviously a much greater rigidity and strength of structure is\r\nneeded to support an aërial organism than an aquatic one, unless the\r\nformer can support itself on other solid structures, such as rocks or\r\ntrees. In the latter case the form attained may be very elongated and\r\nslender, as in the many creeping and climbing plants, which are so often\r\nfurnished with processes for grasping (tendrils) to aid them in their\r\nmode of life.\r\n\r\nAn aërial fixed organism, if it does not rise from the surface of the\r\nearth, cannot spread itself very far without developing other points of\r\nsupport--without rooting again. This re-rooting is a familiar phenomenon\r\nin many plants, as, _e.g._, the strawberry. But even a shrub like the\r\ncommon bramble (which is not itself prostrate, but which sends out\r\nextraordinarily prolonged branches) is aided by such a process. The ends\r\nof its long branches apply themselves to the ground and begin to pierce\r\nits surface, the incipient leaves of its terminal bud becoming\r\nmetamorphosed into roots.\r\n\r\nAn aquatic fixed organism, however, may extend to a very great length,\r\nfreely floating without effecting any such fresh attachment. Thus the\r\nseaweed _Laminaria digitata_[61] will spread over a circle 12 feet in\r\ndiameter, while _L. longicornis_ grows in the form of an elongated\r\nriband, from 8 to 12 feet in length and 2 or 3 feet wide. The giant form\r\n_Macrocystis_ (with a much more subdivided outline) may extend to the\r\nextraordinary length of 700 feet.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which needful gaseous interchange can be effected\r\nand food obtained by different living creatures, govern in various other\r\nways the forms of their bodies.\r\n\r\nThus, if it is helpful to the life of a creature to submit as large a\r\nsurface of its body as possible to the influence of light, or to the\r\naction of air or water, then for this purpose its body must be expanded\r\nand its expanded parts divided and subdivided as they extend in\r\ndifferent directions. It is for this reason that trees branch, and that\r\ntheir branches and twigs divide and subdivide as they do. It is for this\r\nreason also that their branches do not grow out one above another in\r\nprecisely the same direction, but, on the contrary, grow in such a\r\nmanner that each one may overshadow those immediately beneath as little\r\nas may be. Similarly and for the same reason leaves are developed mostly\r\nin an alternating fashion, so that each may be able to expose its green\r\nsurface to the light and air as much as possible.\r\n\r\nPlant-like animals which grow up in an arborescent manner from a fixed\r\nbase do not generally branch in so regularly alternating a mode as do\r\nplants, and in some cases their successive branches may even be\r\nregularly superimposed. This is due to their not requiring, as plants\r\ndo, that their surface should be very extensively exposed to light,\r\nneither their gaseous interchange nor their nutrition being impaired by\r\nsuch superposition. The water which carries to them both the nutritious\r\nparticles on which they feed and the gases they respire, will act with\r\nnearly or quite the same efficiency in either arrangement of their\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nIf the exigences of life require any organism to retain much fluid\r\nwithin it, this circumstance may lead to its assumption of a dilated\r\nmore or less globular form, as in the melon cactus, and, to a less\r\ndegree, in the leaves of the common stonecrop.\r\n\r\nBut the conditions under which alone certain fixed organisms can obtain\r\ntheir food may govern also their internal structure. Thus, we shall see\r\nthat in plants which feed by absorbing matters through their roots, an\r\ninternal arrangement has to be effected for distributing material thus\r\nobtained, and conveying it upwards through the stem. So, again, many\r\nfixed animals need a greater supply of food and gases than they can\r\nobtain from the water which bathes or may reach them without effort on\r\ntheir parts. Such animals may be provided with special internal\r\nstructures, which cause currents of water to flow towards them, and very\r\noften to penetrate within them, as in the shell _Mya_ or the razor\r\nshell.[62]\r\n\r\nFixed subterranean creatures are rare, but such do exist, as, for\r\nexample, the truffle (_Tuber cibarium_). Surrounding influences must in\r\nsuch instances be alike on all sides, while the imbedded position of\r\nsuch organisms render superfluous the development of any elongated\r\nprocess for the purpose of fixing them. Such creatures, then, have a\r\nspheroidal figure, and neither internally nor externally are their\r\nstructures developed in special directions.[63]\r\n\r\nThe fixed organisms which are the most aërial in their habits are\r\nattached to elevated objects, such as trees, and necessarily have a\r\nportion of their frame set apart to fix them to the object which\r\nsupports them. The most conspicuous creatures of this kind are, perhaps,\r\nthe plants termed \"Epiphytes,\" on account of this habit. Amongst them\r\nmay be mentioned the beautiful orchids called \"air plants,\" and the\r\nfamiliar mistletoe. Other vegetable organisms--the multitude of\r\ncreeping plants--rear themselves to great heights by the aid of their\r\nmore robust brothers, but they can hardly be reckoned as aërial\r\norganisms.[64]\r\n\r\nThe colours which plants display have sometimes a singular relation to\r\nthe mountain elevations or geographical positions they inhabit, but\r\nthese considerations will be aptly treated of in the relations borne by\r\nliving creatures to physical conditions and to one another.\r\n\r\nLiving creatures which are capable of moving or being freely moved\r\nabout, present us with similar but more marked differences.\r\n\r\nCertain aquatic creatures drift passively about (borne by streams or\r\ncurrents) with no permanent relation between any fixed portion of their\r\nbodies and the medium which transports them. Such creatures being\r\nequally acted on on all sides by surrounding agencies might be expected\r\n(like the subterranean truffle) to exhibit a spheroidal figure, with\r\nonly one kind of surface upon their whole exterior. This is just what we\r\nfind to be the case in a variety of more or less minute organisms, such,\r\n_e.g._ as _Myxastrum radians_ and _Magosphæra planula_.[65]\r\n\r\nThe former of these consists, at one stage of its existence, of a small\r\nglobular mass of protoplasm, from the whole periphery of which a\r\nmultitude of fine pseudopodia radiate. When about to reproduce, the\r\ncreature retracts its pseudopodia, and forms around its exterior a\r\nstructureless coat or cyst, an action which takes place frequently in\r\nlowly organisms, and is called their process of _encystment_. The\r\ncontents of the cyst then divides into separate bodies, which escape by\r\nthe rupture of the cyst. Each of these bodies is enclosed in a silicious\r\ncase with an aperture at one end, whence its contained protoplasm\r\nissues, and, having so issued, assumes a spherical shape.\r\n\r\n_Magosphæra_ is another small creature which goes through a remarkable\r\nseries of changes, the greater number of which exemplify the ball-like\r\nshape of body alike on all sides.\r\n\r\nWherever the surface of the body is covered by pseudopodia, those\r\nprocesses, inasmuch as they have a power of spontaneous movement, enable\r\nthe creatures possessing them slightly to aid or to resist the drifting\r\naction of the water in which they float.\r\n\r\nBut a living organism may be devoid of any definite shape whatever, as\r\nin _Protamoeba_,[66] which consists of a mere particle of protoplasm,\r\nfrom which irregular-shaped processes of unequal size are irregularly\r\nprotruded in every direction, so that the form of the creature may be\r\nsaid to be quite indeterminate.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of almost all organisms have, however, more or less definite\r\nforms, which may be all classed under seven morphological categories.\r\n\r\n(1). The simplest form of all exemplifies _spherical symmetry_, and is\r\nthat which we have seen in the truffle, the radiolarian, the volvox,\r\n_Myxastrum_ and _Magosphæra_. In this spherical form any number of axes\r\ndrawn through the creature in any direction are equal.\r\n\r\n(2). The next organic form is one in which the body sphere is more or\r\nless elongated at its poles, the latter being equal and similar. In such\r\nan organism we have one axis longer than any one of the others and\r\ncentral, while from this axis symmetrical radii can be drawn in all\r\ndirections. This form may be said to exemplify _equipolar symmetry_, and\r\nsuch is found in some radiolarians, in some small parasites\r\n(_Gregarinida_),[67] and others.\r\n\r\n(3). The next morphological category may be spoken of as _unipolar\r\nsymmetry_. Bodies which exemplify it are like those included in the last\r\ncategory, save that the two poles of the body are not alike.\r\n\r\nInstances of this symmetry are to be sought in creatures which have one\r\nend of their body fixed, or which always or mostly move with the same\r\nend of the body in front, and thus have their two extremities in more or\r\nless constantly different relations to surrounding influences.\r\n\r\nThe lowest worms and sponges may serve as examples of this symmetry in\r\nits simplest expression. As also may the curious compound tunicary\r\ncalled _Pyrosoma_.[68] In all such creatures the body does not extend\r\nout in the form of lateral prolongations.\r\n\r\nBut in many others it does send out processes on all sides, and in\r\nvarious directions, as in most trees and all plants which have a\r\ndefinite axis of growth, so that unipolar symmetry is the predominant\r\nsymmetry in the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\n(4). But unipolar symmetry with diverging outgrowths leads us to the\r\nnext category which may be called _radial symmetry_. Under this head are\r\nincluded the forms of such creatures as possess unipolar bodies from\r\nwhich equal and corresponding outgrowths radiate in different\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nWe have examples of this in the starfishes, in the sea anemones, and in\r\nsuch plants as the melon cactus. But the outgrowths may project in only\r\nfour directions, each being at right angles with the two neighbouring\r\noutgrowths. We thus get a crucial form of radiation, in which the body\r\nmay be described as having one main axis (in the direction of motion)\r\ncrossed by two other shorter but equal axes at right angles to it and to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nWe have an example of this in _Tetraplatia volitans_,[69] an aquatic\r\ncreature with an elongated body, which presents four distinguishable\r\nlongitudinal surfaces, of which each opposite and corresponding pair is\r\nhardly distinguishable from one another.\r\n\r\n(5). This form leads us directly to that kind of symmetry which is\r\npredominant in the animal kingdom and which is called _bilateral\r\nsymmetry_. Forms of this kind exhibit four aspects which may be\r\ndistinguished as right and left, dorsal and ventral. The body here\r\npresents a long axis (in the direction of motion) crossed by two shorter\r\naxes at right angles to it and to each other. Of these shorter axes, one\r\nconnects the dorsal and ventral surfaces, while the other connects the\r\nlateral (right and left) surfaces, and these two axes may be, and\r\ngenerally are, unequal. All worms, insects, mollusks, fishes, birds,\r\nreptiles, and beasts, are examples of creatures with bilateral symmetry.\r\nThe dorsal and ventral aspects of the body generally differ in\r\ncorrespondence with the different relations to surrounding conditions\r\nwhich they usually bear, as notably in snakes and creatures which glide\r\nwith their bellies applied to the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\n(6). The last kind of symmetry which here needs notice is that termed\r\n_serial symmetry_. In the creatures which exhibit it we have a body\r\nwhich is not only almost always bilaterally symmetrical but which is\r\nmade up of a succession of similar parts, forming a series along its\r\nmain or longitudinal axis. Insects, crabs, lobsters, and other allied\r\nforms give us examples of serial symmetry, but this is perhaps best seen\r\nin such animals as thousand legs and hundred legs--millipedes and\r\ncentipedes.\r\n\r\nBesides the fundamental distinctions which depend upon the kind of\r\nsymmetry governing the form of any living being, other subordinate\r\ndifferences exist respectively related to the conditions under which the\r\nvarious activities necessary for life have to be carried on. Such\r\nactivities are the needful gaseous interchange, the processes of\r\nreproduction, and the acquisition of food. Thus, the most intimate\r\nrelation exists between the form of the body and the manner in which\r\nlocomotion has to be effected, whether by the whole body or by processes\r\nprojecting from it. If the latter, then whether by paddling or jumping;\r\nif by the whole body, then whether by lateral or vertical bendings of\r\nthat body.\r\n\r\nThus, we see that fishes, which swim by lateral flexure of the body,\r\nhave the tail expanded vertically; while in porpoises, which require\r\nvertical flexions (to come rapidly to the surface to breathe), the tail\r\nis expanded horizontally. On the other hand, creatures which swim not by\r\neither kind of body flexure, but by a paddling action only, have the\r\ntail shortened, as we see in swans and turtles. Further details of this\r\nkind will be more appropriately treated of in an Essay devoted\r\nexclusively to the consideration of the forms of animals.\r\n\r\nThere are a multitude of aquatic creatures which cannot be properly\r\nspoken of as either \"fixed\" or \"mobile,\" for they are in fact both. They\r\nare creatures which move about by the help of others, being themselves\r\nfixed to other creatures which are actively locomotive.\r\n\r\nThus, sea-snails, lobsters, fishes, whales, and even ships, bear about\r\nwith them sometimes lowly-organized plants; but often other animals,\r\npermanently fixed to and growing parasitically upon them and having the\r\nshape of their body suited to their peculiar situation.\r\n\r\nOften such parasites form flattened encrustations on their involuntary\r\nhosts--as is the case with the acorn shells or sessile barnacles.[70]\r\nOthers have elongated bodies, which stream through the water with the\r\nmotions of the creatures carrying them. We see this in confervoid\r\ngrowths, also in ordinary barnacles, and in certain modified crab-like\r\ncreatures, such as _Lerneocera_.[71]\r\n\r\nThese creatures fix themselves to their movable supports by means\r\nsimilar to those by which other creatures secure themselves to\r\nstationary supports. Thus, some of these do so by means of expanded\r\ndisks, which fit accurately to the supporting surface, while certain\r\nparasites fix themselves by means of ingrowing prolongations or\r\nroot-like processes, as in the _Rhizocephala_.[72] Others, again, adhere\r\nby the intervention of hooks and suckers, and this is especially the\r\ncase with such as fix themselves internally and live perpetually bathed\r\n(as the tape-worms[73] do) in the nutritious fluids contained within the\r\nbowels of the creatures they infest.\r\n\r\nTerrestrial mobile organisms can, of course, only be moved by their own\r\nefforts, or by the efforts of other organisms.\r\n\r\nThe simplest terrestrial locomotion is like that of the aquatic\r\n_Amoeba[74] primitiva_, and is performed by land _Amoebæ_; and the\r\ncurious plant _Myxomycetes_[75] also moves in a substantially similar\r\nmanner. This very curious organism consists of a net-work of\r\nprotoplasmic threads, which spread over decaying leaves and stems. The\r\nthreads exhibit streams of granules flowing within them, and they give\r\nout processes like pseudopodia, while the whole complex mass can slowly\r\ncreep over a supporting surface, which it thus slowly flows over by its\r\nbranching processes.\r\n\r\nOther lowly plants propel themselves by means of a pair of filamentary\r\nprotoplasmic threads, which vibrate actively, and are therefore called\r\nvibratile cilia. As an example may be mentioned the _Protococcus[76]\r\nnivalis_, the little spheroidal alga, which abounds on Alpine summits\r\nand in Arctic regions.\r\n\r\nAs in aquatic, so in terrestrial organisms, external form is intimately\r\nrelated to modes of motion. Thus, locomotion may be effected by\r\nundulations of the whole body, as often in serpents and terrestrial\r\nvermiform animals. It may, on the contrary, be effected by the action of\r\nlevers projecting from the surface of the body, _i.e._, by limbs, and\r\nthese may be multitudinous and minute, as in hundred legs and thousand\r\nlegs, or few and large, as in beasts. Moreover, the motions may be\r\nmovements of pulling or of pushing, or by combinations of these, or by\r\njumps, which may be effected in various manners, the consideration of\r\nwhich will find a fitting place in an Essay devoted to \"Motion.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, terrestrial, like aquatic, organisms often involuntarily carry\r\nabout with them other living creatures which have fixed themselves to\r\ntheir bodies. Thus, the fruits, or seeds, of many plants (as, _e.g._,\r\nthose of the common Agrimony, _Agrimonia eupatoria_) are beset with\r\nhooks or bristles which readily adhere to the coats of passing animals,\r\nand so gain a greater diffusion than they could otherwise obtain. A very\r\nremarkable form of the kind is _Martynia proboscidea_ (called Testa di\r\n_Quaglia_ by the Italians), which has a pair of curved and pointed\r\nprocesses like the tusks of an elephant, which are several inches long.\r\nIt is notorious for adhering to clothes, &c. Other noteworthy plants are\r\n_Uncaria procumbeus_, or the grapple plant of South Africa and\r\n_Harpagophytum_,[77] the fruit of which is provided with hooked\r\nprocesses. Those of _Harpagophytum_ spread out in all directions, and\r\nare of different lengths, with sharp hooks, variously turned, so that\r\nits power of clinging is extreme. The seed, with all its processes, is\r\nso large as to fill the hand when grasped. It is said to cause the death\r\nof the lion. Having adhered to that beast's skin, the irritation\r\nproduced and the impossibility of getting it off at last induces the\r\nlion to bite it, and once in his mouth he cannot remove it, and so the\r\nanimal dies miserably.\r\n\r\nSome animals fix themselves much as these seeds of plants do. Amongst\r\nthem are the parasites known as tics which fix themselves with great\r\ntenacity by the appendages of their mouths. Other parasites--like the\r\nitch insect[78] and forms allied to it--have hooked processes and stiff,\r\nhard bristles, which are at once very irritating and very adherent.\r\nCreatures are also carried about inside others, as is the case with the\r\nseeds of many plants. These are disseminated by birds which have\r\nswallowed but have not digested such seeds, and in an analogous manner\r\nthe great tape-worm group becomes also widely diffused.\r\n\r\nMoving subterranean organisms, inasmuch as they must penetrate through a\r\ndense and highly-resisting substance, must evidently either have forms\r\nwhich offer little resistance--reducing friction to a minimum--or must\r\nbe provided with special means of penetrating such substance. Evidently\r\nthe least resisting form is presented by a body much elongated, rounded,\r\nand more or less attenuated at the advancing end, which end has to\r\neffect the requisite penetration. This is the form of the earth-worm--a\r\nform which is approximated to by a variety of creatures which have not\r\nthe least affinity of nature with it, but only more or less resemble it\r\nas regards its dwelling-place and mode of locomotion.\r\n\r\nSuch, for example, are the curious serpents called _Typhlops_,[79] and\r\nsuch are the legless lizards[80] (_Anguis_), and such, again, are the\r\nsimpler vermiform animals allied to frogs, called _Cæciliæ_.[81]\r\n\r\nIn order to burrow quickly and easily by means of processes of the body,\r\nit is evidently a necessary condition that the earth should be rapidly\r\nremoved by the powerful action of parts situated towards the body's\r\nanterior end. The similarity of effect of similar conditions in\r\ncreatures which are most widely divergent in nature is exemplified by\r\nthe mole and the mole-cricket, which are each provided with a strong and\r\nbroadened-out pair of anterior digging-limbs.\r\n\r\nLiving creatures may be sustained in the air for a longer or shorter\r\ntime at one or another stage of their existence. The reproductive\r\nparticles of the lowest forms of animals and plants are so excessively\r\nminute that they float in the air with the greatest ease, without\r\nneeding any complication of structure--their spheroidal form harmonizing\r\nwith the equal action upon them of influences on all sides of them.\r\nReproductive parts which, though less minute than these, are still very\r\nsmall, may also be diffused by floating in the atmosphere. Such are the\r\npollen grains of those trees which are fertilized merely by the action\r\nof the winds, such as the hazel, poplar, birch, and of lowly plants, as\r\nthe grasses. It is by the wind that the pollen grains of these plants\r\nare accidentally brought into contact with the appropriate surfaces for\r\ntheir reception. Conspicuous in the spring of the year are the clouds of\r\nyellow dust, pollen grains, given off by fir trees, which are plants\r\nalso wind-fertilized. But here we find a slight complication; for to\r\nfacilitate the dispersion of such particles the outer coat of each of\r\ntheir pollen grains is produced into a short wing-like process on each\r\nside, and these processes help at once to sustain it in the air, and to\r\naid its propulsion by offering more surface to the force of the aërial\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\nVery much more conspicuous are the wing-like expansions of many\r\nseeds--such, for example, as those of the maple. These expansions serve\r\nto diffuse the seeds which bear them, as do also the delicate cottony\r\nfilaments which surround the seeds of a variety of plants of widely\r\ndifferent natures and affinities, as some kinds of spider float through\r\nthe air by the aid of the delicate filaments which they send forth to\r\nserve as an aërial float. Familiar to every one is the delicate little\r\nparachute-like structure of radiating filaments on the seeds of such\r\nplants as the dandelion--which seeds most children have at some time\r\nhelped to diffuse by blowing.\r\n\r\nAërial progress by actual effort is effected by a limited group of\r\norganisms, and only in certain cases (bats, birds, and insects) does it\r\ntake the form of true flight in creatures now existing. In other\r\ncreatures, such as so-called flying fishes, squirrels, opossums, and the\r\nlittle flying dragon, the more or less prolonged aërial sustentation is\r\neffected by expansions of skin, which act as parachutes in ways be later\r\ndescribed in detail.\r\n\r\nTrue flight seems to need a definite mechanism of one kind--namely, a\r\nmechanism which shall give rapid and reiterated blows to the air from a\r\npoint towards the dorsal side, and head end of the body, by structures\r\nof considerable superficial extent, and capable of rapid and delicate\r\ninclinations of surface. Such structures must be light and therefore\r\ndelicate, and yet possess very considerable strength to resist the\r\nstrain of the body's prolonged sustentation, and to effect its\r\noccasionally very rapid progress, as in the swift and in dragon-flies.\r\nThese conditions which we find fulfilled in all existing flying\r\norganisms were also fulfilled organisms which have for ages passed away\r\nfrom the surface of this by planet, such as the extinct flying reptiles\r\ncalled _Pterosauria_ or _Pterodactyles_.[82]\r\n\r\nIn all such rapidly flying creatures the form of the body is necessarily\r\nmodified so as to throw the centre of gravity where it may be best\r\nsustained. It is this which packs what are practically a bird's teeth in\r\nits belly, and thickens so greatly the muscles on its breast which are\r\nformed in such a way as to serve both the usual purposes of\r\nbreast-muscles, and also that which is effected in most cases by muscles\r\nof the back, which in birds are very greatly diminished in volume and\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nBut there are living creatures which have relations with two media;\r\nwhich, though they are aquatic, yet by the help of the air rise and\r\nfloat, so as to be partly bathed in the atmosphere; while others carry\r\ndown a portion of that atmosphere below the surface of water, so as to\r\nbe sub-aqueously aërial. Examples of the last-mentioned condition are\r\nafforded by such spiders as have the habit of enclosing a bubble of air\r\nwithin the meshes of their self-woven network, and going down with it,\r\nbeing thus able there to maintain themselves as in a diving-bell. The\r\nreverse condition obtains in such plants as _Valisneria_,[83] which\r\nsecrete air within expanded bladder-like receptacles, and, thus aided,\r\nrise to the surface and float. Another example is that of certain polyp\r\nanimals, such as the Portuguese man of war, which also rise and swim\r\nupon the surface of the sea by the aid of floats in the form of\r\nbladders, which are also filled with air by means of their own life\r\nprocesses. The same also is the case in many seaweeds.\r\n\r\nThus, these multitudinous forms of living creatures, both animals and\r\nplants, are reducible to certain categories in harmony with their modes\r\nof life, and the relations existing between them and all surrounding\r\ninfluences. We may see that, without compliance with certain of such\r\nlaws, their existence would be impossible, and we see that there is a\r\ngeneral correspondence between their shape and structure on the one\r\nhand, and their environment (that is, the totality of all surrounding\r\nagencies and influences) on the other. Are we to consider that such\r\ninfluences are the _causes_ of their form and structure? Obviously the\r\nbiological facts before us, as yet, are insufficient to enable us to\r\ngive a satisfactory answer to this question. It will for the present be\r\nenough to bear in mind that by some writers the environment _is_ deemed\r\nthe one and sufficient cause of all the characters of living creatures.\r\nBut as yet we have not even seen what _is_ the environment. Evidently\r\nphysical influences--the earth, sea, or air, light, heat, and motion--do\r\nnot exhaust it. One important factor would be omitted if we neglected to\r\nnote the share taken in the environment of each living creature by a\r\nmultitude of other living creatures which are in various ways related to\r\nit. This question must occupy us later.\r\n\r\nBut by the forms of living creatures is not meant merely their external\r\nform. Some general notion then should here at starting be obtained of\r\ntheir internal form--that is, of their essential structure.\r\n\r\nThe minutest and probably the simplest forms of living creatures\r\n(whether plant or animal) are such as are presented by _Bacteria_,[84]\r\nthe yeast-plant and _Protoccus_. Bacteria are those minute creatures the\r\nmode of origin of which in sealed infusions has been so much of late\r\ndisputed, but the activity of which in promoting the decomposition of\r\ndead substances is undisputed. A _bacterium_ is a particle of\r\nprotoplasmic matter, either spheroidal or oblong, or like a short rod,\r\nor shaped like a corkscrew, and bacteria may also be in the form of a\r\nshort chain of spheroids, or of oblong particles, or of rods united in a\r\nzigzag manner.\r\n\r\nTheir breadth may vary from the 1/30000 to 1/10000 of an inch. They may\r\nalso assume quite another appearance, by surrounding themselves with a\r\ngelatinous envelope, which condition is called their _zooglæa_ state of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThey may be readily obtained by making some hay tea, and keeping it for\r\na day or two, when they will be found to abound in the scum which forms\r\non the surface, and to be in active motion. In the corkscrew form,\r\n_Spirillum volitans_, each end of the body is produced into a minute\r\nhair-like process or _cilium_, and it is by the lashings of these cilia\r\nthat the minute organism moves about.\r\n\r\nOther as simple but larger organisms may consist of a minute mass of\r\nsemi-fluid protoplasm, containing granules, as we find to be the case in\r\nthe plant _Vaucheria_,[85] and many other _Algæ_, and in the animal\r\n_Amoeba primitiva_.[86]\r\n\r\nAn organism of this simplest kind or a fragment of a higher organism\r\nwhich presents this simplest condition is called a cell.[87] Very\r\ngenerally such cell has within it a more or less distinctly marked\r\ngenerally denser and spheroidal body called a _nucleus_, within which,\r\nagain, other minute spots may appear called _nucleoli_.\r\n\r\nEven in this simplest of all possible conditions of life a slight\r\ndifference appears between its most external film and its inner\r\nsubstance--just as a cup of broth left to stand will form for itself a\r\nfilmy outermost layer. This incipient difference between what is inner\r\nand what is outer is one which is constantly maintained in all higher\r\norganisms, as we shall soon see abundantly. But the distinction into\r\nouter and inner is, as has been said, shown in a much more marked way in\r\nthe constituent units, or _cells_, which build up the bodies of plants\r\ngenerally; for these consist of an inner part of protoplasm, enclosed in\r\na distinct external cellulose envelope or _cell-wall_. As has also been\r\nshown, many of the lowest animals take on occasionally the _encysted_\r\ncondition when they also consist of a particle of bioplasm enclosed in a\r\ndistinct cell-wall or _cyst_, though one not made of cellulose.\r\n\r\nThe protoplasmic contents of the cell may attract watery fluid thus\r\nforming clearer spaces or _vacuoles_ within it, and these may become so\r\nextended that the protoplasm may be reduced to a thin layer lining the\r\ncell wall, thread-like processes or remnants of protoplasm often passing\r\nacross the cell from one part of the protoplasmic lining to another. A\r\ncell, almost always a nucleated cell, is the original form of every\r\nliving creature without exception; and a great number of small, and some\r\nconsiderably sized living beings, never get beyond this unicellular\r\ncondition, however much their cell may become enlarged or complicated in\r\nshape. Such creatures form the lowest of all animals and plants; but the\r\noverwhelming majority of living creatures are formed of aggregations of\r\ncells which cohere and fuse together in various ways. As an example of a\r\nunicellular and typically cellular living creature we may take the yeast\r\nplant (_Saccharomyces cerevisiæ_), which consists of a particle of\r\nbioplasm enclosed in a cell-wall of cellulose, the whole being globular\r\nor oval in shape, and generally about 1/3000 of an inch in diameter.\r\nWithin its bioplasm a clear space or vacuole may often be distinguished.\r\nOften these organisms appear with a more complicated outline, due to the\r\ngrowth of new saccharomycetes from its outer wall, and the budding forth\r\nof others again from the side of such protruding processes, all of which\r\nultimately become detached as independent saccharomycetes, though they\r\noften continue adherent for a long time, forming strings or other\r\ntemporary aggregations of such organisms.\r\n\r\nIn _Protococcus_ we meet with one of the lowest order. Its colour is\r\ngreen, which, as in all other higher plants also, is due to the presence\r\nin its protoplasm of a colouring matter called _chlorophyll_, either\r\ndiffused or aggregated in certain denser granules of protoplasmic\r\nsubstance. Protococcus may be smaller or much larger than the yeast\r\nplant, it is spheroidal, and its protoplasm is enclosed in a tough case\r\nof cellulose, which, however, it may not nearly fill, while the long\r\ncilia may protrude through it and propel the whole organism by their\r\nreiterated lashings.\r\n\r\nIt has been already said that a vegetable may temporarily exist as a\r\nparticle of bioplasm without any cell-wall, and such is the case with\r\n_Protococcus_, the cellular envelope of which occasionally disappears.\r\nMore remarkable still is the form already referred to under the name\r\n_Myxomycetes_,[88] which, for part of its existence, is the form of an\r\nindefinitely-shaped, naked protoplasmic mass.[89]\r\n\r\nLiving creatures which consist of a single cell may present,\r\nnevertheless, a considerable complication of structure. Thus, an\r\norganism as simple as the _amoeba primitiva_, before noticed, may have\r\nthe power of forming, or, as it is technically called, _secreting_, from\r\nits own substance and its surrounding medium a most complex supporting\r\nskeleton of calcareous or silicious nature. It may have its outer\r\nenvelope so markedly differentiated from its inner as to require a\r\ndistinct designation as _exosarc_, while it may give rise in its\r\ninterior not only to a nucleus and nucleolus, but to two regularly\r\nformed cavities with the power of rythmical pulsation, and one definite\r\nportion of its external wall may be perforated to form a permanent mouth\r\ninstead of as in such forms as _Amoeba_, any part serving indifferently\r\nas a mouth and every portion having similar functions without\r\ndifferentiation. All these and other complications of structure may\r\narise by direct growth and transubstantiation of the single cell into\r\nthe various physically and chemically different parts.\r\n\r\nAgain, a living creature which is fixed may so extend itself as to\r\nsimulate stem, roots, and branches, and yet remain essentially simple,\r\nconsisting merely of one greatly enlarged and complicated cell.\r\n\r\nThus, a unicellular plant may take on a great complexity of form while\r\nstill remaining purely unicellular. It may assume the form of a stem\r\nwith roots and leaves. An example of such we may see in the genus\r\n_Caulerpa_,[90] which, although unicellular, simulates in its outline\r\nthe fern called _Blechnum_.\r\n\r\nThe next grade of structural complication in living creatures is\r\nproduced by the lowly plants, such as _Protococcus_, which multiply by\r\nspontaneous self-division or _fission_. This process may take place\r\nrepeatedly and at the same time incompletely, in this way producing an\r\napparently compound organism. Thus, we have the second grade of\r\nstructural complication in living creatures--namely, the aggregation of\r\ncells into a loosely joined mass.\r\n\r\nOther simple forms are those presented by the minute organisms Diatoms\r\nand Desmids, the former enclosed in silicious cases, and some presenting\r\nthe only exception to the general law that organic bodies are bounded by\r\ncurved lines and surfaces.\r\n\r\nWonderful is the minute ornamentation presented by the surfaces of these\r\nmicroscopic plants. Some of them cohere by imperfect division in the\r\nsecond grade of structural complication just described; they may form\r\nlongitudinal series of cells, or they may be arranged round a common\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nOne of the best examples of this secondary grade of complication is\r\npresented by the spherically aggregated cells of _Volvox_.[91] These\r\npresent us with a good example of the way in which the shape of the\r\nindividual cells may spontaneously alter, to suit the mode of their\r\naggregation. Originally spherical, the adjacent sides of these cells\r\nbecome flattened, and thus the cells acquire a polygonal figure.\r\n\r\nOther instances of the coherence of the cells of unicellular organisms\r\ninto indefinite and inconstant aggregations is presented by some\r\nradiolarians, individuals which cohere into what are called _colonies_.\r\n\r\nFrom such incomplete aggregation, the next step is to definite and\r\nstable aggregations, in which the life of the constituent parts is more\r\nor less plainly subservient to, and dominated by, the life of the whole.\r\nSuch we find in all but the lowest _Fungi_,[92] and _Algæ_, in\r\nsponges,[93] and _Hydræ_, and also in all higher organisms. In such\r\npermanent aggregations, the dominant life of the whole is shown partly\r\nin greater constancy of external form and partly in the setting apart of\r\nseparate portions of the whole, either for the nourishment of the entire\r\ncreature or for the reproduction of fresh individuals, or for effecting\r\ngaseous interchange, or (in animals) for ministering to feeling and\r\nlocomotion.\r\n\r\nThus, the overwhelming majority of living creatures are, as has been\r\nsaid, formed of aggregation of cells, which cohere or fuse together in\r\nvarious ways--and not only of aggregation of cells but of aggregation of\r\naggregations of cells or \"tissues.\" Each tissue is a structure formed by\r\nthe aggregation, or by aggregation and metamorphoses, of certain sets of\r\ncells. Thus, every higher plant or animal is made of an inconceivable\r\nmultitude of cells, together with tissues which are not cellular, but\r\nwhich have originated by metamorphosis of cells, and every such higher\r\nplant or animal at first consists entirely of an aggregate of plainly\r\ndistinct cells; and, first of all, of one single cell only, whence its\r\nwhole structure, however complex, has originally sprung, though\r\ngenerally not until it has had at least a portion of another cell mixed\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThis transformation of cells, at first all alike, into distinct orders\r\nof cells or _tissues_, whence different organs with different functions\r\narise, is characteristic of all living creatures above those which each\r\nconsist throughout life of one cell only.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that unicellular organisms may unite into a cylindrical or\r\nspheroidal colony, as in some _Radiolaria_, or into a spheroid of\r\nclosely-adjusted cells, forming one layer, as in _Volvox_. But however\r\nlarge or complex such aggregation may be, it never forms sets of united\r\ncells or tissues. The whole of these lower creatures, therefore, may be\r\nspoken of as unicellular organisms; as though they may consist of many\r\ncells, those cells retain their individuality. Such creatures are all\r\nthe lowest animals--those called _Hypozoa_[94] or _Protozoa_, and also\r\nthe lowest cryptogamic[95] plants.\r\n\r\nAll other animals and all the higher plants are multicellular. The\r\ndescription of one animal (which is placed as it were on the boundary\r\nbetween the multicellular and the unicellular division), the little\r\nparasitic worm _Dicyema_,[96] must for the present be postponed, as its\r\nsignificance could not yet be understood.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the consideration of the forms of living creatures, a\r\nfurther distinction should be made clear--that is to say, a distinction\r\nin the nature of resemblances which may exist between various parts.\r\n\r\nThere are two different relations which may exist between a part or\r\norgan in one animal or plant, and another part or organ in another\r\nanimal or plant. One of these relations is called _analogy_ and the\r\nother _homology_, and it is very desirable to bear clearly in mind the\r\ndistinction which exists between these two relations.\r\n\r\n_Analogy_ refers to the use to which any part or organ is put--that is,\r\nit refers to its function.\r\n\r\nThus, the flower of the daisy is, as we shall see, analogous to that of\r\nthe buttercup. The spathe of an arum is analogous to the corolla of the\r\ndead nettle (for both serve to shelter the essential parts of the\r\nflower).\r\n\r\nThe foot of a horse is analogous to the foot of a man, and the shell of\r\na tortoise to the shell of an armadillo; for the two former serve for\r\nsupport and locomotion, while the latter two are solid protecting\r\nenvelopes to the body. So also the flying organ or wing of a bat is\r\nanalogous to the flying organ or wing of a beetle.\r\n\r\n_Homology_ refers to essential similarity in position compared with all\r\nthe other parts or organs of the body, and must be considered apart from\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nThus, as we shall see in the next Essay a single floret of the daisy is\r\nhomologous with the whole flower of the buttercup. The spathe of an arum\r\nis the homologue of any bract,[97] however insignificant in size and\r\napparently devoid of function. The foot of a horse is homologous (as we\r\nshall see later) to the middle toe only of man, while the shell of the\r\ntortoise is in part homologous with the shell of the armadillo and in\r\npart with the ribs of the latter animal.\r\n\r\nThere is no relation of homology, however remote, between the wings of a\r\nbat and of a beetle, and these two animals (as will shortly appear) have\r\nthe parts and organs of their bodies so fundamentally different, that it\r\nis doubtful whether any definite relations of homology can be\r\nestablished between them.\r\n\r\nA special term has been devoted to signify a resemblance between two\r\nparts in two different animals and plants, which resemblance has been\r\ninduced by or is directly related to their common needs, and the\r\nsimilarity of external influences. This term is \"homoplasy,\" and\r\nstructures which may thus be supposed to have grown alike in obedience\r\nto the influence of similar external causes acting on similar innate\r\npowers have been called _Homoplasts_.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the more general conditions as to structure and figure\r\nwhich living creatures present, and (as has been said) with great\r\ndifferences as to the amount of possible variation, most kinds have a\r\ndefinite limit as to size. It remains only to make general observations\r\non the colours of living creatures.\r\n\r\nBut a few years ago, hardly any few general remarks of really scientific\r\ninterest and value could have been made respecting the varied hues and\r\nmarkings which organisms present. No rational relation was even\r\nsuspected to exist between the colours of plants and the busy insect\r\nlife which swarms about their blossoms or about the varied colours of\r\nbirds, and the details of their habits and modes of existence.\r\n\r\nIt was known, of course, that Arctic foxes and hares became white in\r\nwinter, and that each benefited by its change, and suffered from the\r\nchange of the other; the snow tint which enabled the hare to escape also\r\nfacilitating the unobserved approach of the fox. It was also known that\r\nmany desert animals were of the colour of the sandy plain they wandered\r\nover, and that tree-snakes and tree-frogs were often green. But it\r\nseemed incredible that the varied shades or bright adornments of the\r\nliving world should each and all be governed by rigid laws, generally\r\nconnected with the welfare of the organisms so furnished. Here, if\r\nanywhere, the reign of utilitarianism in Nature appeared to be at an\r\nend, and creative fancy to have full play, regardless but of the harmony\r\nand beauty thus revealed to appreciating eyes. The labours and fruitful\r\nthoughts of Bates and Wallace have, however, opened up a wide field for\r\nmost interesting inquiry. They have made it evident that in many\r\ninstances the most direct utility accompanies colour both in animals\r\nand plants. The colours of flowers serve to attract insects and birds,\r\nby the visits of which they are fertilized or their fertility is greatly\r\naugmented. It is this relation between attractiveness and insect\r\nfertilization which explains the absence of colour from the flowers of\r\nplants which are fertilized only by the wind, such as the fir trees\r\nbefore-mentioned, oaks, beeches, nettles, sedges, and many others. It\r\nalso explains the conspicuousness of the flowers of many oceanic\r\nislands, such as those of the Galapagos archipelago. But it also\r\nexplains, as Mr. Wallace has pointed out, the remarkable beauty of\r\nAlpine flowers, by their need of attracting insects from a distance, the\r\nconspicuous patches of bright colour serving thus to attract wandering\r\nbutterflies upwards from the valleys.\r\n\r\nBut more remarkable still is the explanation given to the semblance\r\nborne by the colours of some creatures to those of others of quite a\r\ndifferent kind, as of some moths to bees, and some harmless flies to\r\nwasps. For now it is clear that by this mimicry they escape the attacks\r\nof many enemies, who avoid such apparently dangerous forms. On the other\r\nhand, the bright liveries of such offensive creatures are highly useful\r\nto the wearers, for such tints act as a warning to enemies, and so save\r\nthem from their being pounced on by creatures which might fatally wound\r\nthem, though unable to swallow them. But the beautiful liveries of such\r\npowerful predatory kinds as tigers and leopards do not serve as\r\nwarnings. They serve their wearers, however, none the less, though it is\r\nby aiding their concealment, and so allowing their prey to approach them\r\nunsuspectingly to fatal nearness. For the vertical stripes of the tiger\r\nresemble the vertical shadows of the grasses of the jungle amongst which\r\nit lurks, as the scattered spots of the leopard agree with the scattered\r\nspots of shadow amongst the foliage of trees on the boughs of which it\r\nlies in wait. But to say more on this head would be to anticipate\r\nremarks to come, when the relations of living beings to one another are\r\nunder consideration, and the subject is too extensive to be here treated\r\nin full. Moreover, it must be noted that such relations do not by any\r\nmeans serve to explain all the phenomena of organic colour. Direct\r\naction is in some curious way exerted upon many organisms, by\r\nsurrounding tints, and similarly different geographical districts and\r\nvarieties of locality affect directly the colour of both animals and\r\nplants, but these questions will be fully treated of under the head of\r\nthe relations of animals to the physical world. Suffice it here to note\r\nthat the phenomena of colour no less than the phenomena of form are in\r\nharmony with (whether or not the result of) the active agencies of all\r\nenvironing conditions. But colour of some kind is a universal attribute\r\nof all material things. Though apparently most irregularly distributed\r\nthrough the world of life, yet order underlies the seeming confusion. Of\r\ncertain large groups certain tints are characteristic, as has already\r\nbeen remarked with respect to the great order to which the dandelion\r\nbelongs. But the same remark may be made of various others, as, for\r\nexample, of the order _Cruciferæ_ (to which the wallflower and turnip\r\nbelong), the flowers of which are generally white, pink, or yellow,\r\nwhile the gentians, again, are noteworthy for exhibiting pure colours.\r\n\r\nBut the colours which predominate in the whole mass of living creatures\r\nof all kinds are tints of green, brown, or reddish-yellow. Bright\r\ncolours, such as blue, scarlet, crimson, gold, or silver are\r\nexceptional, and the colour blue is especially rare. The borrowed\r\nradiance of the inorganic world, in the form of metallic brightness, is\r\nespecially a characteristic of those living gems, the humming birds; but\r\nnot a few other animals also exhibit it. Thus, of birds more or less\r\ngifted with metallic radiance, though in a less degree than humming\r\nbirds, may be mentioned the sunbirds, the trogons, and the beautiful\r\nfamily of pheasants; and many insects and many fishes shine with\r\nmetallic tints.\r\n\r\nBrightness of this kind (though the leaves of a few plants have a\r\ncoppery lustre) is unknown in the world of plants, in which shades of\r\ngreen are overwhelmingly predominant, and are universally present,\r\nexcept in a few exceptional forms, notably the fungi.[98]\r\n\r\nVarious aquatic animals belonging to very different groups agree in\r\npossessing a perfectly glass-like transparency. Amongst them are fish\r\nwhich live in the ocean; for example, the Teleostean[99] fish\r\n(_Leptocephalus_), also mollusca of all kinds, including even perfectly\r\ntransparent cuttle fishes.[100] There are also glass-like\r\ncrustaceans,[101] and also planarians[102] and sea anemones.[103]\r\nPlants, however, never present this character, although by it they\r\nmight, as well as animals, escape being preyed upon.\r\n\r\nMost fishes which inhabit the deep sea are of a dull black colour,\r\nthough some are white, and the majority of all deep-sea animals,\r\nconsidered as a whole, are more or less decidedly coloured, many\r\nbrightly so.[104]\r\n\r\nLuminosity is a character of many lowly animals, and it is the presence\r\nof minute creatures possessing this character which so often causes the\r\nspray dashed from the prow of an advancing ship to appear like a shower\r\nof sparks, while glowing bodies traverse the water beneath its surface.\r\nMany insects, such as fire-flies and glow-worms, are notoriously\r\nluminous. In the vegetable world, however, this character is very rarely\r\npresent, being only so in certain fungi, some of which exhibit a\r\nwonderful luminosity. Humboldt relates that he found this to be\r\nespecially splendid in mines.\r\n\r\nAs like phenomena of colour characterize certain groups of living\r\ncreatures, so also like phenomena of colour may characterize certain\r\ngeographical regions being common to creatures of very different kinds\r\nwhich inhabit such regions, as we shall hereafter see. The brightest of\r\nliving things, the humming birds, have their true home in the equatorial\r\nregion of America, to which continent they are exclusively confined. But\r\nit is in the equatorial region of the whole earth that we find the most\r\nbrilliant birds of other kinds, the most brightly coloured reptiles and\r\nfishes, the largest and many of the loveliest butterflies, moths and\r\nbeetles, the most beautiful orchids, the largest of all flowers and of\r\nall clusters of flowers.\r\n\r\nBut neither the temperate, nor even the Arctic nor Antarctic climes are\r\ndenied the glory of bright tints in the long days of their brief, but\r\nsometimes fervid, summer. Indeed, the golden burst of gorse and glow of\r\nheather in our temperate zone have, in their way, an unequal charm;\r\nwhile every here and there Arctic lands and Alpine heights exhibit\r\nbeauties of colour which are hardly elsewhere presented by the field of\r\nanimated nature to the eye of man.\r\n\r\n    ST.

By others it is\r\nused to denote any particle of protoplasm enclosed in a cell-wall, and\r\nby others, again, as denoting any distinct particle of protoplasm with\r\nor without a nucleus, and with or without a cell-wall. It is in this\r\nwidest sense that it is here proposed to use the term \"cell,\"\r\ndistinguishing, where needful, those with a nucleus or envelope as \"a\r\nnucleated\" or \"a walled\" cell.\r\n\r\nAs yet the two natures and functions of the nucleus and nucleolus are by\r\nno means cleared up. The nucleus often appears to contain a complexity\r\nof fibrils, transitory aggregations of which have been supposed to cause\r\nthe appearance of nucleoli. The apparently simplest protoplasm is\r\nprobably of really very complex, most minute structure.\r\n\r\n[88] CONTEMPORARY REVIEW, September, 1879, p. 37.\r\n\r\n[89] Here reference may be made to the name _Bathybius_, which was given\r\nby Professor Huxley to a material found at the sea bottom, of great\r\nextent and indefinite shape, and which was supposed by him to be the\r\nremains of a mass of once living protoplasm, but which there is much\r\nreason now to suppose was really but inorganic material. Reference is\r\nhere made to this, because some persons seem to imagine that if\r\n_Bathybius_ were a lowly animal some important speculative consequences\r\nwould follow. But this is an utter mistake. It is generally admitted\r\nalready that there are living structureless protoplasmic organisms of no\r\ndefinite shape, and of which detached particles can live and grow.

It is not pleasant\r\nto live among the ruins of a crumbling Empire, however picturesque these\r\nruins may appear at a distance, and however much it may be for the\r\ninterest of foreign politicians to leave them undisturbed. Whatever may\r\nbe the course of contemporary thought in England, where the fate of\r\nTurkey has unfortunately become a party question, the people of Turkey\r\ncan only think of it as it affects their own interests, and they desire\r\nabove all things that the people of England, without distinction of\r\nparty, should understand their condition as it is. This is a reasonable\r\ndesire, whether anything can be done for them or not; and these letters\r\nare intended to represent contemporary life and thought _in Turkey_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fall of Khaireddin Pacha.\r\n\r\nKhaireddin Pacha commenced life as a Circassian slave in Tunis. He came\r\nto Constantinople last year as an exiled Prime Minister of the Bey, but\r\npossessed of immense wealth which he had accumulated while in office,\r\nand with a high reputation for learning, skill as an administrator, and\r\ndevotion to the faith of Islam. He was well received by the Sultan, who\r\noften consulted him in regard to political affairs; and finally, through\r\nthe influence of France and England, he was appointed Grand Vizier. But\r\nhe made no friends among the Turkish Pachas, and had no party in the\r\ncountry. Even the most liberal of the governing class regarded him as an\r\ninterloper, who had neither the ability nor the experience necessary to\r\nfit him for the place which he had secured by European influence. He\r\nreciprocated their distrust, and spoke of them freely as a band of\r\nbandits. He was too good a Mussulman to attempt to build up a party\r\namong the Christians. He depended simply upon his personal influence\r\nover the Sultan and the support of the French and English Ambassadors.\r\nHe succeeded in exiling all the ex-Grand Viziers, but he had still more\r\ndangerous enemies among his own colleagues, who thwarted him at every\r\nstep, worked upon the fears of the Sultan, and brought the affairs of\r\nthe Government to a dead-lock. He finally proposed to the Sultan a plan\r\nof Government which, under the name of reform, involved an abdication of\r\nhis supreme power in favour of the Grand Vizier. This was supported by\r\nall the influence of France, England, and Austria, but opposed by the\r\nUlema and almost the whole governing class. It led to a formal decision\r\non the part of the Ulema, which is of far greater importance than the\r\nfall of the Grand Vizier which was the first result of it. It declared\r\nthat the Sultan ruled the Empire as Caliph, that he was bound by the\r\nSheriat or sacred law, and that he could not delegate his authority to\r\nanother. Under this decision there can be no such thing as civil\r\ngovernment in Turkey. Civil law can never take the place of the Sheriat,\r\nand the emancipation of the Christian subjects of the Porte is an\r\nimpossibility. The Ulema admit the necessity of administrative reform,\r\nand recognize the fact that the Empire is in peril; but it must be a\r\nreturn to ancient customs, and not a recognition of the principles of\r\nEuropean civilization. They are in favour of limiting the power of the\r\nSultan, but it must be limited by an extension of the influence of the\r\nUlema. This triumph of the Ulema is the one important feature of the\r\nMinisterial crisis. As Khaireddin had no party, there are few who regret\r\nhis fall. As few had any faith in the influence of English moral suasion\r\napplied to the Sultan by Sir A. H. Layard, there are few who are\r\ndisappointed at its failure; but it may be well to note that Sir A. H.\r\nLayard and Khaireddin Pacha have both attempted to control the Turkish\r\nGovernment by their personal influence over the Sultan, and have both\r\nbeen defeated by the stronger influence of palace intrigue. There are no\r\ndoubt certain advantages in maintaining intimate personal relations with\r\nan absolute sovereign, but, in fact, no sovereign is so absolute that he\r\ncannot be to a great extent controlled by his Ministers; and the\r\nAmbassador who is intimate with the Sultan, and seeks to control his\r\nactions, is certain to excite the jealousy and opposition of the\r\nMinisters and the palace. Even with the Sultan himself, he is obliged to\r\nassume a very different tone from that which he would use in dealing\r\nwith a Minister. He may smile, but he cannot frown--he may suggest, but\r\nhe cannot threaten--he may persuade, but he cannot dictate--he may\r\nsecure a promise, but he cannot exact its fulfilment. In the present\r\ncase he has certainly failed to keep his own _protégé_ in office, and,\r\nwhat is more important, he has failed to secure any modifications in the\r\nsystem of government.\r\n\r\nThe Ulema who have triumphed in this conflict are the most powerful,\r\ncompact, and thoroughly organized body in Turkey. They represent all the\r\nwealthy and influential Turkish families. They monopolize the two great\r\ndepartments of law and religion, and the revenues of the higher orders\r\nof the hierarchy are immense. Those who are not fanatics by nature or\r\nconviction are so by profession, and their idea of reform is a return to\r\nthe good old days of the Caliph of Bagdad. The Sultan is afraid of them,\r\nand he has reason to be so. When the crisis came it was much easier and\r\nsafer for him to yield to them than to follow the counsels of Sir A. H.\r\nLayard, or to abdicate in favour of Khaireddin Pacha. He could invite\r\nthe former to dinner oftener than ever, and give the latter a pension.\r\nHe had nothing to fear from either.\r\n\r\nThe office of Grand Vizier was abolished for the second time within two\r\nyears, and a Prime Minister appointed who could be trusted to do\r\nnothing; and it is a curious fact that this office is now abolished for\r\nthe sake of increasing the power of the Sultan, while it was given up\r\ntwo years ago for the purpose of limiting his authority and\r\nstrengthening that of the Ministry. It was Achmet Vefik Pacha, the most\r\ndetermined and independent man in Turkey, who was then appointed Prime\r\nMinister. It is Arifi Pacha, a man who never had an idea of his own, who\r\nis now selected to fill the place; while men of strong will and\r\nreactionary proclivities like Osman Pacha and Said Pacha continue to\r\nhold their places as Ministers of War and Justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSultan Murad.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that all the Turks are satisfied with this\r\ntriumph of the Ulema, and the rule of Osman Pacha. Those who are out of\r\noffice are, of course, dissatisfied. But beyond this there is a strong\r\nparty at Constantinople which favours a radical change in the Government\r\nas the only hope of saving the Empire from destruction. They would limit\r\nthe power of the Sultan by a genuine Constitution, and a Representative\r\nAssembly; but they believe that this can never be accomplished under the\r\npresent Sultan. The fate of Mithad Pacha is always before their eyes.\r\nTheir plan is to dethrone Hamid and reinstate Murad, whose liberal views\r\nare well known, and whose health is such that he could not resist\r\nradical measures even if he did not favour them. I have no means of\r\nknowing the real strength of this party, or exactly who are its leaders,\r\nnor do I know anything more of the health of Sultan Murad than the fact\r\nthat his partisans declare that he is quite as sane and strong as his\r\nbrother. But there is such a party, and it is confident of ultimate\r\nsuccess. Of course, it is not supported by the British Ambassador, as\r\nMithad Pacha was in the overthrow of Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz; but it may have\r\nother foreign influence behind it, and it would, no doubt, result in the\r\nimmediate recall of Mithad Pacha to the capital. As I am\r\nconstitutionally a Conservative and opposed to revolution, I have not\r\nmuch sympathy with this movement; but I have no doubt that, if Turkey is\r\nto be left to herself to work out her own destiny, there is more to be\r\nhoped from a Representative Assembly than from any other possible\r\nmodification of the Government. Mithad Pacha's Parliament was a surprise\r\nto the world, and not least to those who devised it. His Constitution\r\nwas a fraud designed to deceive Europe. The members of his Assembly were\r\nselected by the Government, its acts were ignored. It was finally\r\ndisbanded, and many of its members were imprisoned. But in spite of all\r\nthis it demonstrated the fact that there was material in Turkey for an\r\nindependent Assembly, which would be qualified by a little experience to\r\ncontrol the Government, and would favour radical reforms in the\r\nadministration. The governing class at Constantinople is hopelessly\r\ncorrupt and effete, but men came up to this Assembly from the interior,\r\nwho might in time have supplanted the present rulers, and infused new\r\nlife into the administration. Those who now favour an Independent\r\nParliament believe that the present Sultan will never consent to it, and\r\ntherefore propose to reinstate Murad; but it is possible that if English\r\nmoral suasion were turned in this direction, it might meet with more\r\nsuccess than it has obtained thus far. The Ulema would probably oppose\r\nit, although they accepted it as part of the plan of Mithad Pacha.\r\nCircumstances have changed, and their experience of the last Assembly\r\nwas not satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that Sultan Murad himself has any part in\r\nthis plan, or any knowledge of it. He is kept a close prisoner, and\r\nguarded from all outside influences with the greatest care, but his name\r\nis powerful, for his misfortunes and the well-known amiability of his\r\ncharacter have roused the sympathy of the common people in his behalf.\r\nThey are inclined to regard him as their rightful sovereign, and to\r\nbelieve that he might save them from their present misery. They may be\r\nmistaken, but all the world sympathizes with their kindly feeling\r\ntowards this unhappy prince, whose mind gave way under the burden of\r\nresponsibility which was suddenly forced upon him, and the shock which\r\nhe experienced at the death of his uncle and his Ministers, who was\r\nhimself deposed before he had regained his faculties, and who, for no\r\nfault of his own, is doomed to spend his life as a prisoner of State.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Progress of Reform.\r\n\r\nWe are officially assured that the change in the Ministry will in no way\r\nimpede the progress of reform, which has already been carried out in the\r\nDepartment of Justice, and which is soon to be applied to the civil\r\nadministration. The plan has already been elaborated. It has been sent\r\nto the Valis for their approval, and will soon be submitted to the\r\nEastern Roumelia Commission, after which it will be considered by the\r\nSultan and, if approved by him, will be proclaimed in the form of a new\r\n_Hatt_. It professes to be a plan for a reorganization of the Vilayets,\r\non the principle of decentralization and local self-government. It does\r\nnot seem to excite much interest in any quarter, probably for the reason\r\nthat all this exists already _on paper_, and that if Aali Pacha could\r\nnot execute the elaborate scheme, which he proclaimed when the Vilayets\r\nwere organized, there is not much probability that the new _Hatt_ will\r\nbe any more effective. The people of Turkey have no faith in paper\r\nreforms. They are issued as easily as paper money, and are as easily\r\nrepudiated; they are like leading articles in the daily papers--they are\r\nwritten, read, and forgotten, alike by the author and the reader, within\r\nthe twenty-four hours. There is an old proverb current among the Turks\r\nwhich says, \"The decrees of the Sultan last three days--the day they are\r\nmade, the day they are kept, and the day they are forgotten.\" If the\r\nproverb were a new one, the second day would be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe reforms which have been completed by Said Pacha, the Minister of\r\nJustice, are not of a nature to encourage the hopes of the people. A\r\nlarge number of new officials have been appointed, but they are of the\r\nsame class as those already in office. Indeed, there seems to have been\r\na special purpose in these appointments of making it known to the people\r\nthat no change was to be expected in the method of administering the\r\nlaw. Only seventeen out of one hundred and eighty-three of these new\r\nofficials are Christians, and the Turkish papers take pains to declare\r\nthat it is absurd to suppose that Christians are competent to hold these\r\noffices. This is the result of the demand of Lord Salisbury that the\r\nCourts of the Empire should be reorganized under European control. They\r\nwill continue to be what they have been, and it will be but a small\r\nconsolation to the suffering people of Turkey to know that they have\r\nbeen condemned in strong terms by the British Government. The worst\r\nfeature of the case is that the law offers no man any protection against\r\narbitrary arrest and imprisonment. A man may be thrown into prison and\r\nkept there for years without any trial or any knowledge of the charges\r\nbrought against him. Such cases are very common. Or he may he beaten by\r\nthe police, or chained in a dungeon, on the most frivolous charge. I\r\nknew a case the other day of a Greek who was severely beaten because he\r\nrequested a police officer to arrest a Turk who was plundering his shop\r\nin broad day. All this was done in the presence of a European gentleman,\r\ntoo. There are several Armenians in prison now in Constantinople whose\r\nonly offence was the wearing of hats in place of the fez. At the same\r\ntime, crimes of every description are committed with impunity without\r\nany apparent effort on the part of the authorities to discover the\r\nperpetrators. Almost in sight of Constantinople, and under the immediate\r\njurisdiction of the capital, is a district where for months the peaceful\r\ninhabitants of Adabazar have been plundered and murdered by the\r\nCircassians. They have appealed again and again to Constantinople for\r\nprotection. They have tried to interest the Ambassadors in their behalf.\r\nThey sent a deputation to the Grand Vizier. He had no time to see them,\r\nbut turned them over to another official who requested them to present\r\nhim in writing a statement of the reforms which they thought were needed\r\nin the Empire! A few hundred soldiers, or even one determined man sent\r\nfrom Constantinople, would have restored order; but nothing could be\r\ndone. Five men were murdered while the deputation was in this city. The\r\nwhole Turkish coast of the Black Sea is infested with brigands who\r\nplunder at will. They are well known, but no one thinks of arresting or\r\npunishing them. Travellers are only secure when they are provided with a\r\nsafe-conduct from the leaders. The Reports of the new Consuls in Asia\r\nMinor acknowledge a state of things which is almost too bad to be\r\nbelieved. There is no security in the administration of the law for\r\nperson, property, or life, and there seems to be no prospect of any\r\nimprovement. Some more radical reform is needed than the appointment of\r\none hundred and sixty-six new Turkish judges.\r\n\r\nA scheme of financial reform has also been projected, and the foreign\r\nEmbassies have been invited to nominate a certain number of persons as\r\ninspectors to superintend the collection of the revenue; but this is\r\nnothing new. The Imperial Ottoman Bank has nominally held this position\r\nfor many years, and at times has exercised some control, no doubt with\r\nadvantage to the Government. A new system of taxation, carried out under\r\nthe control of honest and responsible Europeans, would increase the\r\nrevenue of the Government without adding to the burdens of the people;\r\nbut the place where reform is most needed is in the expenditure rather\r\nthan the collection of the revenue. The present scheme does not command\r\nconfidence in Constantinople in regard to the collection of the taxes,\r\nand it offers no security for the control of the expenses of the\r\nGovernment. The truth is that the whole financial system is hopelessly\r\ncorrupt, and, however it may be patched or mended, it will be rotten\r\nstill. There is no hope for the Turkish Government until it is ready to\r\nput its finances into the hands of competent Europeans who shall have\r\nabsolute control over everything connected with expenditure as well as\r\ncollection; and I am sorry to say that there seems to be no present\r\nprospect of any such arrangement. The enormous expenditure of the Palace\r\nis unlimited and uncontrolled, and the Sultan will not submit to any\r\ncontrol. Financial reform must begin there, or it will amount to\r\nnothing. The present Sultan before he came to the throne was known to be\r\na very careful and economical man, and no doubt he would be glad to be\r\nso now, but he has not the courage to break with the traditions of the\r\npast--give up his thousands of slaves, women, and palace officials, and\r\nlive like a European sovereign rather than an Oriental despot. So long\r\nas he maintains the present system he must have money, no matter who\r\nstarves for want of it; and he must continue to take money, on his\r\npersonal order, from whatever department of the Government may be so\r\nhappy as to have any in its treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Government is bankrupt; its revenues are not half enough to meet its\r\ncurrent expenses; its army is starving; its civil service forced to live\r\non plunder; its income mortgaged for years in advance to secure loans on\r\nwhich it is paying thirty or forty per cent. interest in one form or\r\nanother; but still no one would dare to suggest to the Sultan the\r\npossibility of his reducing his own expenses to a sum equal to that\r\nexpended by the Queen of England. Thus far all talk of financial reform\r\nis prompted by the desire to borrow more money in Europe to meet the\r\npresent wants of the Government. These difficulties once surmounted,\r\neverything would go on as before. It is no friendship to Turkey to lend\r\nher money, until such time as the Sultan and his Ministers are ready for\r\na real reform, beginning at the Palace, and conducted under the control\r\nof Europeans appointed and supported by their own Governments. But there\r\nis no prospect of any such arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe Turks do not appreciate the dangers which beset them. They see that\r\nthe country is in an unsettled state, and they feel the want of money;\r\nbut the evils of which the people complain are nothing new. They exist\r\nnow in an aggravated form, on account of the war and the confusion which\r\nhas reigned for several years at Constantinople; but the Turks see no\r\nreason why they should not be reduced to a normal state, and be quietly\r\nendured for centuries to come, as they have been for centuries past.\r\nTheir attention is directed exclusively to their foreign relations, and\r\nwhatever is said or done about reform is intended solely to conciliate\r\npublic opinion in Europe. Could the rulers here be brought face to face\r\nwith a really independent Representative Assembly, freely chosen by the\r\npeople, they would be made to think less of Europe and more of Turkey.\r\nThey would see that their rule has become well-nigh intolerable, even to\r\nthe Mussulman population of the Empire. Then there would be some hope of\r\ngenuine administration and financial reform. It is even possible that\r\nthe Christian element in such an Assembly might be strong enough to\r\nsecure, in time, the emancipation of the non-Mussulman population--and\r\nit should never be forgotten that this must come in some form. England\r\ndoes not insist upon it now, but she will, and so will all Europe. It\r\nwould be far better for Turkey if it could be brought about by the\r\nChristians themselves; but if it is not, it will be forced upon the\r\nTurks by direct European intervention, or possibly by the overthrow of\r\nthe Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Crisis.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Egypt have been so fully discussed in England that it is\r\nunnecessary for me to do more than to indicate the course of thought on\r\nthis subject at Constantinople. At the outset, the Sultan and his\r\nMinisters sympathized with the Khedive. They feared that European\r\nintervention at Cairo would pave the way for a similar intervention\r\nhere; and when he appealed to the Sultan he had reason to expect his\r\nsupport. But the Turks thought they saw their opportunity to regain\r\ntheir hold on Egypt, and the Khedive was summarily removed. The Turkish\r\npapers here did not hesitate to rejoice over it as a \"new conquest of\r\nEgypt,\" and it is still believed here that this view of the subject was\r\nencouraged by England, that it was the purpose of Lord Beaconsfield to\r\nescape from the embarrassing demands of France by restoring Egypt to the\r\ncontrol of the Sultan.\r\n\r\nBut when the Turks found that they had been misled or mistaken, and that\r\nEgypt was less than ever under their control, they regretted the steps\r\nwhich had been taken, and began once more to sympathize with the Khedive\r\nwhom they had deposed. He was very liberal in his expenditure of money\r\nat Constantinople, and always found it for his interest to maintain a\r\nhost of retainers here; but the new Khedive will have no money to spend\r\nhere, and will need agents in Paris and London rather than in\r\nConstantinople. The tribute-money no longer comes here, but is paid to\r\nbondholders in England and France. There is no hope of putting any more\r\nTurks into lucrative offices in Egypt. In short, the connection of that\r\ncountry with Turkey is no longer anything more than nominal, and the\r\nTurks feel their disappointment very keenly. They have now but one hope\r\nleft. They understand very well the difficulties which must arise from a\r\njoint protectorate by France and England, and hope that the mutual\r\njealousies of these Powers may throw Egypt once more into the hands of\r\nTurkey. The tone of the French press, even of so cautious and\r\nconservative a periodical as the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, gives them\r\nsome ground for this hope; but the Khedive lost his throne by giving too\r\nmuch importance to this mutual jealousy, which manifested itself much\r\nmore plainly in Egypt than it did in Europe; and it is to be hoped that\r\nthe Turks will be equally disappointed. Every one in the East regards\r\nthe present situation as impracticable and temporary, but it may result\r\nin the independence of Egypt under a general European protectorate, or\r\nin a further division of the Ottoman Empire by the annexation of Egypt\r\nto England and Syria to France. The opportunity of annexing Egypt\r\nwithout compensation to France was lost when England refused to listen\r\nto the suggestions of Germany three years ago, because, as Lord Derby is\r\nreported to have said, it would have shocked the moral sense of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greek Question.\r\n\r\nThe Greek Question is not a simple one. Very few questions connected\r\nwith the East are simple. The aspirations of the kingdom of Greece are\r\nnatural. Her appeal to Europe was justifiable, and there can be no\r\nquestion of the advantage which it would be to Greece, and to the\r\npopulations of Epirus, Thessaly, and Crete, if these provinces were\r\nannexed to the kingdom. If this were all, they would be annexed, and all\r\nthe world would rejoice. It is to be regretted that the Congress of\r\nBerlin did not shut its eyes to other considerations and settle it\r\noff-hand in this way; but they did not, and no Power now exists which\r\ncan do so.\r\n\r\nThese provinces belong to Turkey, and she cannot see that it is for her\r\ninterest to give them up. Greece cannot possibly offer her anything in\r\nreturn for them, and, as against Turkey, she has no claim upon them. The\r\nCongress of Berlin advised Turkey to arrange, by friendly negotiation,\r\nfor the cession of a part of them; but there is really no ground upon\r\nwhich a negotiation can be based. Turkey is ready to yield something out\r\nof respect to Europe, but she naturally wishes to give up as little as\r\npossible. Then there are other Powers interested. Austria and Italy, but\r\nespecially the former, have their own views of the destiny of European\r\nTurkey, and their own plans of aggrandizement. Albania and Macedonia\r\nhave to be considered. England, France, and Russia, also, are looking\r\nforward to the future, and questioning how the settlement of this\r\nquestion will affect their plans for the final solution of the Eastern\r\nQuestion. Here is room for intrigues without end, and complications\r\nwithout limit.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks are indignant, especially against England and Austria; and\r\ntheir papers here have used some very disagreeable language. They are\r\nnow solemnly protesting against the right of Sir A. H. Layard and Count\r\nZichy to take a short vacation, so long as this question remains\r\nunsettled. Some of them seem to believe that Osman Pacha really\r\ncontemplates a reconquest of Greece itself, and that England might\r\nconsent to it. All this is absurd; but there can be no doubt about the\r\nfact that England and Austria have thus far opposed the claims of\r\nGreece, and that Austria and Turkey have, each in her own way,\r\ncontributed to excite discontent in Albania, and keep up a state of\r\nanarchy in Macedonia. A leading paper in Vienna, ten days ago, openly\r\ndeclared that it was the intention of Austria to push on to Salonica,\r\nafter taking possession of Novi Bazaar. She certainly has very little\r\nsympathy with Greece, and if this question is to be settled at all she\r\nwill keep the Greeks as far from Salonica as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish papers are allowed to discuss this question with perfect\r\nfreedom, and one of the most moderate, the _Djeridei-Havadis_, says:--\r\n\r\n    \"If the Hellenic Kingdom is desirous of avoiding a war with the\r\n    Albanians, it ought to follow the line of conduct proposed by the\r\n    Porte. If it acts in opposition to it, a war will follow which can\r\n    only result in ruin, as has happened before. If the Porte had only\r\n    to satisfy Greece, it is probable that it would show itself\r\n    yielding, but the Imperial Government cannot, with a light heart,\r\n    provoke a conflict and see the blood of its subjects poured out, for\r\n    the Albanians have decided to defend their country, arms in hand. It\r\n    is astonishing that Europe, in seconding the demands of Greece,\r\n    completely forgets the rights of the Albanians.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission appointed to settle this question is now in session at\r\nConstantinople, and some arrangement may be made, but the current\r\nopinion in the city, among both Greeks and Turks, is that neither party\r\nwill yield anything. Another meeting is to be held to-morrow; and if\r\nthe Greeks are ready to give up Janina, a settlement is possible--in\r\nspite of the Albanians. The impression is that they will not fight,\r\nalthough the Greeks in Thessaly and Epirus have roused their hostility,\r\nand have failed to do anything to conciliate them in past years. They\r\nhave an honest fear of being Hellenized by force, and although they have\r\nlittle sympathy for the Turkish Government, and are constantly\r\nquarrelling among themselves, they still have a strong national pride,\r\nand they may take up arms in good earnest. If they do, it will be a\r\nserious matter for Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Principality of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nBulgaria is enjoying a brief period of comparative repose. The Russians\r\nhave left the country. The Prince has assumed the reins of Government.\r\nThe people are busy with their harvests, and, except in certain\r\ndistricts where the disbanded soldiers of the Turkish army have taken to\r\nbrigandage, there is peace and quiet everywhere, and there is no reason\r\nto fear anything more disquieting than the excitement of a general\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nThe Principality has a great advantage over Eastern Roumelia, in that it\r\nhas secured its independence, and can work out its destiny by itself,\r\nwithout any interference on the part of the Turks or of an European\r\nCommission; but both Prince and people are without experience, and there\r\nare no popular leaders who have any practical knowledge of government.\r\nThe people are jealous of their newly-acquired rights, and naturally\r\nopinionated and disputatious. The coming elections will no doubt cause\r\ngreat political excitement, and the new Assembly will not be very easily\r\nmanaged, or be likely to win the admiration of Europe by its wisdom. It\r\nshould be remembered, however, that this lack of experience is the\r\nmisfortune and not the fault of the Bulgarians, and that Europe has not\r\ndealt with them in a way to win their confidence and command their\r\nrespect. It has left them with a grievance which they can never forget\r\nfor a moment, which must influence all their political action, and which\r\nforces them to maintain intimate relations with Russia, which is not a\r\ncountry where they can learn political wisdom, although it has given\r\nthem a Constitution which is a model of liberality. There was nothing in\r\nthe Russian administration of the province which was adapted to prepare\r\nthem for such a Constitution, or teach them how to conduct a free and\r\nliberal government. Prince and people have to begin everything for\r\nthemselves. Indeed, they are probably worse off than they would have\r\nbeen if there had been no civil administration attempted in the province\r\nby the Russians. An army of occupation of any country is unfitted for\r\nthe organization of civil government. This was attempted on a grand\r\nscale in the Southern States of America after the civil war, and under\r\nexceptionally favourable circumstances, but all these civil governments,\r\nestablished and fostered by military force, were unsatisfactory while\r\nthey continued, and disappeared when the army was withdrawn. If this was\r\na work which could not be accomplished by the United States, and by an\r\narmy which was made up chiefly of civilians, it is not strange that,\r\nwith all possible goodwill, the Czar of Russia failed to establish a\r\nsatisfactory civil administration in Bulgaria. He gave them as good a\r\nPrince as was to be found in the German market, and as liberal a\r\nConstitution as any in Europe. He maintained order and protected all\r\nclasses as long as his soldiers remained in the country; but the whole\r\nadministration was necessarily Russian in its spirit and methods, and\r\naltogether unlike what it ought to be under the new Constitution. The\r\nBulgarians who were trained under it will have to unlearn much that they\r\nhave learned, and begin anew, or they will fail to satisfy the people.\r\nAll this is the misfortune rather than the fault of the nation, and it\r\nhas a right to expect that Europe will be patient and friendly, while it\r\ngains by experience the wisdom which no nation has ever acquired in any\r\nother way.\r\n\r\nPrince Alexander is young, and as inexperienced as his people, but those\r\nwho know him best have confidence in his good sense, and he is said to\r\nbe not unlike the late Prince Albert in character. He will need all his\r\ngood qualities to attain success; and if successful, he will certainly\r\ndeserve to be ranked with the Prince Consort and King Leopold. His work\r\ncertainly involves more self-denial than either of theirs, and not less\r\ntact and good sense. He was no doubt elected through the influence of\r\nRussia; but he is no mere creature of the Czar, and has no desire to act\r\nas a Russian agent. On the contrary, he is heartily in sympathy with the\r\nliberal ideas of the West, and anxious to secure the goodwill of\r\nEngland. Thanks to the efforts of Mr. Palgrave, the English\r\nConsul-General, this does not seem to the Bulgarians so hopeless a task\r\nas it once did.\r\n\r\nThe Prince was received by his people with the greatest enthusiasm. No\r\nsovereign was ever more heartily welcomed, and each stage of his journey\r\nwas a new triumph. He probably appreciated this all the more from the\r\nfact that his visit to Constantinople was made as disagreeable as\r\npossible. He was first refused permission to come at all, on the\r\npretence that his life would be in danger. This plea was too absurd to\r\ndeceive any one, but it might have caused serious difficulty if he had\r\nnot appealed to the Great Powers, and at the same time manifested a\r\ndisposition to conciliate the Porte by proposing to limit his stay at\r\nConstantinople to a visit of a few hours. He arrived in the Bosphorus in\r\nthe morning, and left in the afternoon. He was received by the Sultan,\r\nbut was told that owing to the pressure of business his Firman was not\r\nready, and could not be delivered to him. No Bulgarian was allowed to\r\napproach him, and no boat allowed to go out to his steamer. Large bodies\r\nof troops were stationed along his route and about the Russian Embassy,\r\nand he was treated very much like a prisoner of State. It is not easy to\r\nunderstand why this farce was played by the Turks, or what they expected\r\nto gain by it. They probably refused the permission in the first place\r\nwith the intention of treating him as an ordinary Turkish Vali, and\r\nsending his Firman to be read in public at Tirnova by a Turkish\r\nofficial; but after the failure of this plan there was no obvious reason\r\nfor treating him as they did at Constantinople. Some have supposed that\r\nit was intended as a studied insult to the Prince, others that it was an\r\nelaborate practical joke played upon the Russian Embassy, which had at\r\none time suggested that it was unnecessary for the Prince to come to\r\nConstantinople, as other vassal Princes had always done. But whatever\r\nmay have been the motive which prompted this singular treatment, it only\r\nserved to make the reception of the Prince the next day at Varna more\r\nimpressive, and to give more importance to the wild enthusiasm of his\r\nnew subjects, who could not have received him with greater joy if he had\r\nhimself just delivered them from the hated rule of the Turks. He was\r\ninaugurated at Tirnova, the ancient capital, and then went at once to\r\nSofia, the new seat of government. His first difficulty was the choice\r\nof a Ministry. Two parties had already been developed in the\r\nConstitutional Assembly which adopted the Constitution and elected the\r\nPrince. They grew out of a difference of opinion in regard to religious\r\nliberty, freedom of the press, the right of association, with other\r\nsimilar questions, and at once assumed the names, Conservative and\r\nLiberal. The Conservative party included the clergy of the Bulgarian\r\nChurch, and some of the best educated and most enlightened Bulgarians,\r\nwho felt that too much liberty was a dangerous thing for a people\r\nbrought so suddenly from bondage to freedom--who feared that the country\r\nwould be flooded with Nihilism, Socialism, and all other isms. The\r\nLiberal party, however, had a large majority in the Assembly, and was\r\nled with considerable skill by two or three experienced politicians, who\r\nwere wise enough to avoid extreme measures. When the Prince arrived, he\r\nattempted to form a Ministry which should include the leaders of both\r\nthese parties; but for some reason the majority of those selected were\r\nConservatives, and the Liberals declined to serve with them, so that he\r\nhas a Conservative Ministry, with the probability that the new Assembly\r\nwill have a strong Liberal majority. This is an unfortunate beginning,\r\nas the party conflict which is likely to ensue will probably weaken the\r\ninfluence of some of the best men in the nation, who are really Liberal\r\nin their views, but who fear that absolute liberty will degenerate into\r\nlicense and sap the foundations of religion and morality. They do not\r\nthink that the people are ready for \"a free Church in a free State.\"\r\nThey fail to see that the influence of the Church can only be\r\nstrengthened by educating the clergy and reviving their spiritual life.\r\nThe Bulgarians are naturally a religious people; but, both while they\r\nwere under the Greek Patriarch, and since they have received their\r\nindependence, their Church has been an essentially political\r\norganization. It needs now to be spiritualized. The best men of both\r\nparties acknowledge this; but, as in all other countries, there is a\r\ndifference of opinion as to how far it should be defended and supported\r\nby the State.\r\n\r\nI have said that this division of parties was an unfortunate beginning\r\nfor this new State, but after all it is far better that there should be\r\nreal living questions before the people than that politics should\r\ndegenerate into a new struggle for office. The very discussion of these\r\nquestions will tend to educate the people and revive the Church, and it\r\nwill probably be found that when a new Liberal Ministry is formed the\r\nresponsibilities of office will make it as conservative in most respects\r\nas the present Government. The Prince has the confidence of all the\r\npeople, and will no doubt accept the result of the coming elections as a\r\nConstitutional sovereign, and then direct the attention of the people to\r\nother questions of the utmost importance concerning the organization of\r\nthe various departments of the Government. No doubt serious difficulties\r\nwill be encountered and mistakes will be made, but the spirit of the\r\npeople is good. They desire good order, peace, and quiet, and they will\r\nmake every effort to secure it. They merit the sympathy and goodwill of\r\nall civilized nations, and especially of those who believe in free\r\ngovernment and liberal institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEastern Roumelia.\r\n\r\nThe condition of affairs in Eastern Roumelia is much less hopeful, as\r\nthe difficulties encountered in the organization of the Government are\r\nvery much greater and more numerous. North of the Balkans they are only\r\nsuch as might be experienced by any new Representative Government in any\r\ncivilized country, but in the nondescript province of Roumelia the\r\npeople are suffering from evils inflicted upon them by the Congress of\r\nBerlin. Everything is unsettled. No one knows who rules the country, or\r\nwhat is the form of government. It seems to be for the interest of\r\ncertain parties to prolong this state of things and introduce as much\r\ndisorder as possible. The people are kept in a constant state of\r\nexcitement, and no one knows what to expect from one day to another. The\r\nCongress of Berlin is primarily responsible for this, and no doubt it\r\nwas for the interest of Austria to keep up a state of anarchy and\r\nconfusion in European Turkey. It was her plan to absorb the European\r\nprovinces herself, and the way must be kept open to Salonica and if\r\npossible to Constantinople. It is believed here that England went to\r\nBerlin with a secret agreement to support these pretensions of Austria,\r\nbut no one sees exactly how England is to profit by this arrangement. It\r\nis certain that no one in Turkey gained anything by the division of\r\nBulgaria, but the evils which have resulted would have been much less if\r\nin addition to this division the Congress had not devised the\r\nextraordinary scheme of giving different forms of Government to the two\r\nBulgarias. This plan, of course, insured the permanent discontent of the\r\nwhole Bulgarian nation, but, worse than this, it made the impression\r\nupon the Turks and Greeks that the arrangement for Eastern Roumelia was\r\nonly a temporary one, and that by skilful agitation they might overturn\r\nit. They have not failed to improve this opportunity. The Phanariote\r\nand Roumelian Greeks are doing everything in their power to create\r\ndisturbance and cause difficulty in Eastern Roumelia. An unceasing\r\ntorrent of abuse is poured out upon the Bulgarians by the Greek papers\r\nand their French organ the _Phare du Bosphore_. They are full of false\r\nstatements and misrepresentations of every kind, and a portion of the\r\nGreeks in the province act in full sympathy with these papers. Free\r\nGreece does not sympathize with this crusade, and an attempt was made a\r\nfew weeks since to induce the Greeks here to come to an understanding\r\nwith the Bulgarian Church, by withdrawing the excommunication and\r\narranging for harmonious co-operation. It is understood that the\r\nPatriarch was in favour of this, but the Greek papers here opposed it\r\nwith a violence which was incomprehensible to the uninitiated. They\r\ndeclared that \"the maintenance of the schism was the only hope of\r\nHellenism,\" and appealed to the Porte to prevent by force a\r\nreconciliation \"which would inevitably result in the union of Greeks and\r\nBulgarians to drive out the Turks and divide the country between them,\"\r\nThis opposition on the part of the Phanariotes prevented the execution\r\nof the plan.\r\n\r\nThe Turks also are doing what they can to create disturbance in the\r\nprovince, and find some excuse for occupying it with their army. This\r\nwas, of course, to be expected, and is in some degree excusable. They\r\nnaturally wish to regain possession of this rich province, and they feel\r\nthat they have cause of complaint against the Bulgarians, who do not\r\nreceive the returning refugees with much cordiality. There are real\r\ndifficulties on both sides which cannot fail to give rise to serious\r\ntrouble. It is a pity that the whole arrangement could not have been\r\nleft to a really impartial Commission, free to act on principles of\r\nequity and common sense. The difficulties are such as these, for\r\nexample. There are many towns where the Bulgarian quarter was burned by\r\nthe Turks. When the Turks fled and the Bulgarians returned, they\r\noccupied the Turkish houses, and they are now naturally disinclined to\r\ngive them up to the refugees and camp in the fields. Again, there are\r\nmany cases where the Bulgarians were deprived of their lands in the most\r\niniquitous manner some years ago, under the pretence of a new law in\r\nregard to title-deeds. These lands were seized by rich Turks, who fled\r\nduring the war, but now come back to claim them. The Bulgarians have the\r\noriginal titles and the Turks new ones. To whom do the lands rightly\r\nbelong?\r\n\r\nThere are other cases where Turks return who are known to have taken\r\npart in the massacres. There has been a general amnesty, but it can\r\nhardly be expected that these persons will be well received. These are\r\nonly a few of the many difficulties connected with the return of the\r\nrefugees which irritate the Turks and the Bulgarians both; and in some\r\ncases both parties merit our sympathy.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these deliberate attempts to make trouble on the part of\r\nthe Turks, Greeks, and also of some few hot-headed Bulgarians who are\r\nfoolish enough to suppose that a disturbance might hasten their union\r\nwith the Principality, the confusion in the Government is a source of\r\nconstant trouble. No one knows what the Government is. The Porte claims\r\nsupreme authority, and sends peremptory orders to the Pacha. The Pacha\r\nnaturally considers himself the head of the Government. The European\r\nCommission claims the right to exercise control whenever it sees fit.\r\nThe Consuls assume the right to intrigue or to dictate in the name of\r\ntheir respective Governments. The Administrative Council, a majority of\r\nwhich is Bulgarian, considers itself to be responsible for the\r\nadministration, and there is a Constitution of hundreds of articles\r\nwhich is theoretically the law of the land. A National Assembly is soon\r\nto be added to the list. The militia have been under the command of a\r\nLevantine Frenchman, who was not responsible to the Governor, and who\r\ndoes not appear to have had a single qualification for his office.\r\nHappily he has just been replaced by a better man.\r\n\r\nHaving inflicted all this confusion upon Eastern Roumelia, the European\r\nPowers are complaining that the people do not know how to govern\r\nthemselves! Perhaps they do not, but as yet they have had no opportunity\r\nto make the experiment. If peace and quiet is ever to be restored to\r\nthis unhappy province, the Government must be simplified and\r\nconsolidated; it must be left to manage its own affairs, and to make the\r\nbest it can of the elaborate Constitution which Europe has conferred\r\nupon it. Alecko Pacha is not a great man, but he was the best man\r\navailable for his position, and he is a man who is much more likely to\r\nthrow up his office in disgust at the trouble which it gives him than to\r\nlend himself to any scheme for resisting the will of Europe. He ought to\r\nbe encouraged and supported. The Bulgarians, who constitute the majority\r\nof the population, are discontented at the arbitrary action which\r\nseparated them from the Principality, but they are satisfied that they\r\nhave nothing to gain from any present agitation of this question, and\r\nthey only desire to be left to govern themselves in accordance with the\r\ndecision of Europe, and to be assured that they will not be turned over\r\nagain to the tender mercies of the Turkish Government. The fear of this\r\nis universal, and it is this fear which keeps them in a state of\r\nconstant excitement. It is not without reason. A large Turkish army is\r\ncamped on their borders. The Porte is seeking some excuse for entering\r\nthe province. Certain European representatives at Philippopolis are\r\nalways threatening this, and the people believe that they are intriguing\r\nto bring it about. Everything is in confusion and uncertainty in regard\r\nto the Government, and nothing seems settled. There can be no peace and\r\nquiet in a country which is in constant fear of invasion, and something\r\nought to be done to remove this fear from Eastern Roumelia. The Turkish\r\narmy should certainly be removed, and the Porte should be warned to let\r\nAlecko Pacha alone and allow him to organize his Government as best he\r\ncan. If this source of fear and irritation were removed, the Bulgarians\r\nwould accept the situation and make the best of it. It would be for\r\ntheir interest to do so, and an industrious, thrifty population is\r\nalways quick to see what is for its interest.\r\n\r\nThe gymnastic clubs, which were originally formed for another purpose,\r\nare now kept up and supported by sober, conservative men, simply from\r\nthis fear of a Turkish invasion. If the fear were removed these\r\nassociations would be dissolved at once, as they ought to be; for\r\nBulgarian merchants are not in the habit of spending money for anything\r\nwhich is not essential to their well-being. These clubs are not\r\nrevolutionary, but they might become a source of disorder if they were\r\nmade permanent.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that the European Powers will allow any invasion of\r\nthe country; but the Turks have always in hand the pretence of sending\r\ntroops to occupy the Balkans, and this fact to some extent justifies the\r\nfears of the Bulgarians. If there were danger of another Russian\r\ninvasion, the Turks would be fully justified in occupying the passes at\r\nonce, and there is nothing in Eastern Roumelia to prevent or even delay\r\nsuch an occupation; but under present circumstances, when there is\r\nnothing to be feared from Russia--when peace and quiet is the thing of\r\nall others to be desired--the occupation of the Balkans would be a\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n    AN EASTERN STATESMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTEMPORARY BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--HISTORY AND LITERATURE OF THE EAST.\r\n\r\n(_Under the Direction of_ Professor E. H. PALMER.)\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Malleson certainly did well to claim permission to rewrite Sir\r\nJohn Kaye's last volume (_History of the Indian Mutiny_, by Colonel\r\nMalleson, Vol. I., London: W. H. Allen & Co.), and comparison of the two\r\nmay afford to the historian of the future valuable aid in interpreting\r\nthe volumes yet to come. A great part of the present must be held to be\r\nthe work of the virulent pamphleteer and violent partisan rather than of\r\nthe historian; and if the quotations of, and references to, the Red\r\nPamphlet indicate relations between Colonel Malleson and its author, the\r\npublishers cannot be held to have exercised a wise discretion in their\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nThe task of the reviewer of such a book is unusually heavy. Book for\r\nbook, almost chapter for chapter, it is intended to replace Sir John\r\nKaye's work, and the reviewer therefore needs to study the two\r\ncarefully, and to compare them minutely. Colonel Malleson, no doubt, had\r\naccess to Sir John Kaye's materials, but within a certain field seems to\r\nhave been unable to see the other side of any question. To arm, to leave\r\nSepoys armed, is simply to detain European troops to watch them; it is\r\nnothing that to disarm them is to drive them, and all their connections,\r\nwild with terror as sheep marked for the slaughter; yet he cannot be\r\nignorant of the cases in which a few bad men committed a regiment, and\r\nhow whole regiments \"went\" in terror of their masters' vengeful\r\ndistrust.[105] In saying, as he does so confidently, that by enrolling\r\nthe Calcutta Volunteers on their first offer, on 20th May, Lord Canning\r\nwould have set free half a European regiment, Colonel Malleson must have\r\nbeen thinking of what the Volunteers might have been fit to do had they\r\nbeen enrolled and drilled six months before,--provided they had been\r\nwilling to take the day-work of garrison duty, and to think more of the\r\nState than of the house and furniture at Ballygunj: the real profit of\r\nthe enrolment was the confidence and cheerfulness organization gave to\r\nthe Europeans themselves. And--to take a more important instance--the\r\n\"Gagging Act\" was an insolent expression of distrust of Englishmen, an\r\nattempt to prevent their opinions reaching England _in print_. For\r\ndistrust of their discretion English editors had given cause enough, and\r\nfor influencing English opinion, as Indian newspapers may be said to be\r\nunknown in England in their original sheets, a letter from the editor of\r\nthe _Friend of India_ to any English paper would have been as sure of\r\nEnglish readers, and of as much weight with them, as if it had been set\r\nup in the damp printing-house at Serampore.\r\n\r\nColonel Malleson quotes from the \"Red Pamphlet,\" as Sir John Kaye had\r\ndone before him, a smart description of \"Panic Sunday.\" From Colonel\r\nCavanagh's report it seems pretty clear that the higher classes--the\r\n\"society\"--of Calcutta were not among the refugees in the fort, and as\r\nSecretaries to Government and Members of Council may be counted on the\r\nfingers, it would be as well if the historian would name the fugitives\r\nbefore death takes all who could answer the charge. We have had access\r\nto the diary of a young civilian, then a guest of the Member of Council\r\nwho lived furthest from Government House, away in Alipore, beyond the\r\nhouse of the Lieutenant-Governor and the great jail of Alipore and the\r\nlines of the native regiment which was the great terror of Calcutta: on\r\nthat Sunday, host and guest went to the Cathedral twice as usual, and\r\nafter the evening service the guest returned home, while the host drove\r\nto Calcutta to call on some cousins; as the cousins had driven to\r\nAlipore, and the visitors at both houses waited a while those households\r\nat least were afoot till a later hour than usual, and at last went to\r\nbed as usual without closing an extra door.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter closes with an impassioned peroration, wherein the\r\nremoval of Mr. William Tayler from his post at Patna is likened to the\r\njudicial murder of Lally, and the starvation of Dupleix. It is clear\r\nenough, from Colonel Malleson's account, that Mr. Tayler liked to carry\r\nout his own plans too well to risk interference by over-frankness to his\r\nsuperiors. In the face of an enemy such concealment may be as\r\nmischievous as disobedience, and Sir John Kaye reminds us that at an\r\nearlier date confidence in Mr. Tayler's judgment had been shaken; and\r\nhis report of his message to his district officers, the report which\r\nimmediately preceded, and probably led to, his suspension, says nothing\r\nof the clause which sets the treasure above anything save human life.\r\nUnder any circumstances Mr. Tayler's defence is not helped by sharp\r\ncensures on Mr. Money, or by blindness to the fact that the best\r\nintelligence made a march to Patna seem more perilous than the far\r\nlonger one through a jungle country to Calcutta. Wise after the event,\r\nindeed, we may see that Mr. Tayler's forecast was sounder than Mr.\r\nHalliday's; but the Lieutenant-Governor, and Lord Canning too, could\r\nonly act on the circumstances known to them, and Mr. Tayler was replaced\r\nby an officer of yet higher rank in the official hierarchy, and probably\r\nforestalled renewed promotion by resigning the Service as soon as he\r\ncould get a pension. But why were not his services rewarded? asks\r\nColonel Malleson, ready with the hard word \"intrigue.\" But who were the\r\nsharers in the intrigue, and who was to profit by it? Men whom Lord\r\nCanning sharply rebuked and degraded were yet recommended by him for\r\nhonour, and no courteous letter from Mr. Talbot can do away with the\r\nfact that the Viceroy, writing when all heat of strife was over and all\r\nfacts known, yet did not obtain for Mr. Tayler any distinction.\r\n\r\nOn one point, however, we are bound to protest against Sir John Kaye's\r\nharsh judgment: to him the arrest of the Wahabi leaders was a scandalous\r\nbreach of the usages of war. But they were unquestionably subjects of\r\nthe British Crown, and the question surely is--would they have resisted\r\narrest by ordinary process or not? If not, they had to thank Mr. Tayler\r\nfor courteous consideration in arresting them himself, and detaining\r\nthem in honourable captivity; in resisting they would have been guilty\r\nof that rebellion against their sovereign in which there was too good\r\nreason to believe them sharers.\r\n\r\nOn the many points whereon both authors are in substantial accord it\r\nwould be waste of space to touch, and we pass to the other important\r\nepisode in which Colonel Malleson traverses Sir John Kaye's judgment,\r\nand here our verdict is with the later author: in treating of Durand's\r\nconduct at Indore, Colonel Malleson seems to have risen above the region\r\nof personal feeling, if not of personal knowledge; so that while his\r\nfull and vivid narrative shows plainly the difficulties, political and\r\nstrategical, of Durand's position and also of his retreat, he shows as\r\nclearly that it is no simple case of Durand _versus_ Holkar, but one in\r\nwhich each may be commended without loss of credit to the other.\r\n\r\nSo much space has been of necessity devoted to the chief points on which\r\nthe two authors are at variance, that none is left for the transactions\r\nwhich Colonel Malleson's changed arrangement brings into the present\r\nvolume, though Kaye had intended for them a place in some later one. His\r\nwork in the new field makes us only the more regret that he did not\r\nbring to his task the unbiassed mind of a man who had never known the\r\nauthor of the Red Pamphlet or Mr. William Tayler. But we would, in a\r\nconcluding word, beg him to revise his Indian spelling; to a man who has\r\nonce felt the charm of a fancy rule the claims of established usage go\r\nfor nothing, but at all events he may be decently consistent; why does\r\nColonel Malleson double so many letters which in Urdu are single, and\r\nwhy does he spell the name of the ancient and famous, if now obscure,\r\ntown of Jaunpore as though it were \"the City of Life\"?\r\n\r\nCaptain Low's _History of the Indian Navy_ (2 vols., London: Bentley &\r\nSon) has long been reproachfully demanding notice; it is easy to say\r\nsomething about such a work, not easy to treat it worthily. A man could\r\nhardly put together 1100 pages of small type without recording many\r\nnoteworthy facts, but all matters of interest might have been packed in\r\nmuch smaller compass, and so packed would have found more readers and a\r\nmore favourable verdict.\r\n\r\nThe two volumes trace the rise and fall of the Navy from its germ in the\r\n\"ten grabs and galivats\" taken up for the defence of the factory and\r\nshipping of Surat in 1615, through the period of its glory when its\r\nships bore the Company's flag alongside of the Royal Navy on many\r\nhard-fought days, through its decline, when they carried mails or\r\ntransported troops with rare enjoyment of a brush, to its abolition in\r\nour own time, when, less fortunate than its sister service, it fell a\r\nvictim to mutiny and disorders in which it had no share.\r\n\r\nThe first period in its history ends with the year 1759, when, with the\r\ncapture of Gheriah, and the destruction of Angria's power, piracy as a\r\nbusiness of State came to an end, and when the ruin of the Seedee, and\r\nthe substitution of the Company as High Admiral of the Mogul Empire,\r\nplaced the local Marine first among the maritime powers of India. Its\r\nfirst serious service was in the operations which broke the power of the\r\nPortuguese in the Gulf, and in 1622 reduced Ormuz from an emporium of\r\nproverbial wealth and magnificence to its normal condition of a poor\r\nbarren island, and for many years the Portuguese found it as much\r\noccupation as the pirates who might well have been its first concern. No\r\ndoubt the captains of well-armed India-men, whose crews were borrowed\r\nfor service on grabs and galivats, looked down on the latter as a sort\r\nof coastguard, but the aid of such light craft was invaluable against\r\nthe shoals of small vessels which beset new-comers fore and aft, pouring\r\ndown crowds of well-armed men from their long overhanging prows. For in\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the shores of the Indian Ocean\r\nswarmed with pirates, kept down indeed by the Portuguese in the heyday\r\nof their power, but making head again till, by the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, according to Italian travellers, they feared none\r\nbut Dutch and English, and these only for a pestilent practice of firing\r\nthe magazine rather than surrender. Yet to the Mogul governor of Surat\r\nprobably the pirate of home growth was less objectionable than the\r\nintrusive trader; and indeed the Nuwab was not without excuse if he\r\nregarded the European as a more powerful pirate, seeing that some\r\ncommanders took by force goods which the native owner would not sell,\r\nothers ransacked ships not said to belong to the Mogul's ports, the\r\nmutinous crews of others became open pirates; and lastly, we find\r\nCaptain Kidd, and other heroes of the black flag, practising their\r\nvocation in these seas. The native pirate, the European rival, and the\r\nprofessional rover, kept the local marine pretty well employed, but it\r\nis not always easy to distinguish between the services of this body and\r\nthe Company's armed trading ships.\r\n\r\nOf more interest to the Mogul Government than foreign trade were the\r\nvessels in which Mahomedan pilgrims of all ranks sailed to Arabian and\r\nPersian shrines, and for their benefit it came to terms with the Seedee,\r\nbetter known to us as the Hubshi of Jinjirah, the boldest of the\r\npirates, giving him a large allowance and high rank to secure his\r\nconvoy. The Company made more than one attempt to supplant him, and\r\nindeed furnished ships to guard the Mocha-Jeddah fleet in 1698, but the\r\nSeedee kept his office till 1759; in the general decay of the central\r\npower he first neglected, then openly defied, the Governor of Surat, and\r\ninstead of protecting trade became its chief oppressor; till at last, in\r\n1759, after much negotiation, the Nuwab induced the Bombay Government to\r\nintervene, and as a reward obtained for the Company the Seedee's office.\r\nWhat direct profit the Company derived from the appointment Captain Low\r\ndoes not tell us; the omission can hardly be the consequence of the\r\nlamented destruction of papers which followed the sale of the old India\r\nHouse, for he records that in 1694 the Seedee's subsidy amounted to four\r\nlacs, no doubt considerably bettered by presents, and in 1735 the money\r\nallowance was but a lac and a half: the revenues of the districts and\r\ncustoms assigned to the Company went to support the Surat squadron, but\r\nthe fees of office granted to the officer who was its deputy amounted,\r\nto near a lac of rupees a year; it is well to remember that the holder's\r\ngross pay was but Rs.1,000 a year, that the Governor of Bombay had but\r\nsome £500, and that till near the end of the century private trade was\r\nallowed: no one, however, was permitted to enjoy this great prize for a\r\nsecond year. Whatever were the profits to the Company, the Nuwab could\r\nsee that it did more for its wages than the Seedee, for in the next nine\r\nyears the Surat squadron destroyed near a hundred pirate vessels of the\r\nGulfs of Cutch and Cambay.\r\n\r\nAfter another seventy years the Bombay Marine became in name what, as\r\nthe only local armed fleet, it had long been in fact--the Indian Navy.\r\nWherever round the basin of the Indian Ocean there had been fighting in\r\nthose years, the vessels of the Bombay Marine had borne the British flag\r\nwith honour, though the services of officers and crews, both afloat and\r\nashore, had been too sparingly recognised. And in those years was\r\ncommenced the series of surveys which are still the chief authorities\r\nfor the navigation of the Eastern seas, and have given the names of\r\nRennie, Moresby, Haines, and Taylor a permanent place in history. But\r\nmen who entered the Bombay Marine were still serving efficiently when\r\nthe Indian Navy was abolished, in the belief that ships of the Royal\r\nNavy would carry on the police of the seas as efficiently, but at less\r\nannual cost, and that other arrangements might be made for the business\r\nof inland navigation and transport; the necessity for recurrent shore\r\nsurveys seems not to have been foreseen, though already a special\r\ndepartment has been created and placed under a retired officer of the\r\nIndian Navy. It is impossible not to admit that, through its want of\r\ninfluential friends, the Service was treated unjustly. The guarantee of\r\n\"Colonel Sykes's clause\" has, through repeated agitation, been made so\r\neffectual for officers of the Indian Army that men of forty have retired\r\nas full colonels, because all their regimental seniors had joined the\r\nStaff Corps, while the officers of the Indian Navy were forced to retire\r\nwithout appeal on something like the pension of their rank. But they\r\nmust have felt a grim satisfaction in knowing that they had outlived the\r\npiracy which had been the scourge of Western India and the first cause\r\nof the creation of the force; their last serious service was in\r\nadministering a final pounding to their old enemies the Waghers, the\r\nlast survivors of the flourishing pirate communities of Kattyawar.\r\n\r\nBesides surveys of the Eastern seas, European nations trading with India\r\nare indebted to the Indian Navy for the opening up of the Overland\r\nRoute, and so, indirectly, for the construction of the Suez Canal.\r\nWithout steam, indeed, the Red Sea could never have become a highway of\r\ncommerce, while with its extended use that great canal could not for\r\never be closed; but the _Hugh Lindsay_ of the Indian Navy, the first\r\nsteamer constructed in the East, which, after thirty years of service,\r\nwas still staunch enough for work as a tug at Kurachi, was the first\r\nsteamer to appear on its waters, making the voyage to and from Suez in\r\n1830, under the command of Captain John Lindsay. The expense of the\r\nvoyage, however, was so great that, after seven trips, the Court bade\r\nthe Government of Bombay only repeat it in case of emergency, and it was\r\nreserved for Lieutenant Waghorn, also of the Indian Navy, by sacrifice\r\nof his private fortune and professional prospects and ten years'\r\nunceasing labour, to prove that communication with India through the Red\r\nSea was not only a luxury of State, but a profitable commercial\r\nenterprise. From his labours all have profited save himself and his\r\nfamily, and the only public acknowledgment of his services is a bust in\r\nthe Canal Garden at Suez.\r\n\r\nWith some labour, caused by the want of an index, many notices of\r\ninterest might be quarried from Captain Low's pages. The early history\r\nof Bombay, the antecedents of the rulers of Muscat and Zanzibar, the\r\nsettlement at Aden, the true story of Perim, the achievements of the\r\nSepoy Marines, who are now represented by two regular regiments of the\r\nBombay Army, all invite notice, but our space is exhausted. Yet we must\r\nfind room to mention the self-denial of Commodore Hayes, who, rather\r\nthan embroil the Company with China, released two junks captured in\r\nrunning the blockade from Batavia with Dutch property, and so sacrificed\r\nhis large share of £600,000 lawful prize; and the gallantry of\r\nMidshipman Denton, who, unable to board a proa, lashed her bowsprit to\r\nthe taffrail of his gunboat, and so continued his course, fighting her\r\nall the time. And for contrast with the experience of the Bay of Bengal,\r\nwhere we believe that the full pressure of a great cyclone has never\r\nbeen recorded, as the anemometers have broken with a pressure of sixty\r\npounds, we may note that, in the cyclone of November, 1854, so famous at\r\nBombay, the pressure did not exceed thirty-five pounds to the square\r\nfoot: with such a storm as that which raged in Calcutta in October,\r\n1864, the whole native town of Bombay would come down like a house of\r\ncards. We are sorry not to have been able to notice Captain Low's\r\nlabours more favourably; particular points which we had noted for\r\nobjection we will pass over in silence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCaptain Richard Burton is _facile princeps_ of modern travellers. There\r\nscarcely any part of the world which he has not visited, and wherever he\r\ngoes he seems to have the history, geography, and ethnology of the\r\ncountry at his fingers' ends. His last important contribution to\r\ngeographical science is the account of his visit to the Land of Midian,\r\nwhither he went, commissioned by the ex-Khedive of Egypt, in search of\r\nthe gold mines of which the ancient Arab geographer and others speak.\r\nThe results of his expeditions are published in two works: _The\r\nGold-Mines of Midian and the Ruined Midianite Cities_ (London: C. Kegan\r\nPaul & Co., 1878) and _The Land of Midian (Revisited)_, 2 vols., issued\r\nby the same publishers during the present year. Having received an\r\ninvitation from the ex-Viceroy, Captain Burton proceeded to Cairo in\r\nMarch, 1877, where an expedition was organized for the purpose of\r\nexploring the auriferous region. The author's comparison of the Cairo of\r\nthe present time with the city as he knew it in his old pilgrim days,\r\nand as it is described in Lane's \"Modern Egyptians,\" forms, although\r\nonly incidental, a very interesting portion of the book. The chapter on\r\nSuez also is a good specimen of Captain Burton's style, and contains at\r\nonce a topographical sketch, an archæological and historical\r\ndescription, and a chatty and amusing account of the modern city, its\r\nsociety, and surroundings. Midian, called nowadays by its inhabitants,\r\nas by the mediæval Arabic geographers, _Arz Maydan_, the Land of Midian,\r\nis that part of Arabia which occupies the east coast of the Gulf of\r\nAkabah, and extends some two degrees further to the south. The borders\r\nare somewhat difficult to ascertain, and it is probable that the ancient\r\nMidianites, like some of the larger and more powerful Bedawin tribes of\r\nthe present day, wandered far and wide, and that their limits shrunk or\r\nextended according to their numbers, or the resisting power of their\r\nneighbours. The ancient history of the land is told by Captain Burton in\r\na most exhaustive manner, the Biblical accounts being supplemented by\r\ncopious references to Greek, Latin, Jewish, and Arabic writers of all\r\nages. The quantity of gold, silver, and other metals mentioned in\r\nNumbers xxxi. 22, as being produced by Midian, was curiously borne out\r\nby the results of the expedition. A lengthy and learned notice is also\r\ngiven of the Nabathæans, whose former rock-cut capital, Petræa, is still\r\none of the marvels of Arabia; whose king, or ethnarch, Aretas (in\r\nArabic, El Hareth), is mentioned in the New Testament; and whose rule\r\nembraced so large a portion of Syria and Arabia, and extended late into\r\nChristian times.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that gold existed in Midian was in the first place due to\r\nHaji Wali, familiar to the readers of Captain Burton's \"Pilgrimage to\r\nMecca and Medina\" as the companion of the author in the caravanserai at\r\nCairo while preparing for the journey to Hejjaz. The old Haji was once\r\nreturning from a visit to Mecca, when halting by the shore of the Gulf\r\nof Akabah he scooped up a handful of granitic sand which sparkled in the\r\nbed of the wady and took it with him to Alexandria. There he took his\r\nspecimen to an assayer, and, although the glitter which had attracted\r\nhim proved only to be produced by the presence of mica, his sand when\r\nsmelted in a crucible yielded a comparatively large portion of pure\r\ngold. The information of the discovery was not received with\r\nencouragement by the official to whom Haji Wali communicated it, and the\r\nlatter ceased to think more of the subject. The assayer, however, set\r\nout for the new Eldorado and lost his life, probably murdered by the\r\nBedawin. Captain Barton believes that the secret of the gold has never\r\nbeen really lost, and that the washing of sand has always been\r\nclandestinely carried on. Be that as it may, Captain Burton, believing\r\nthe Haji's story, endeavoured to recommend his discovery to the notice\r\nof the Egyptian authorities, who _pooh-pooh'd_ the whole thing, and\r\nmerely remarked that gold was becoming too common. For nearly a quarter\r\nof a century Captain Burton kept the secret to himself, but at length he\r\nagain sought out his old friend Haji Wali, obtained from him more exact\r\ninformation as to the locality, and carried him off with the expedition,\r\nthe means for organizing which Ismail Pasha furnished. The results of\r\nthe expedition, which was only a pioneer one, were sufficient to\r\ncorroborate all that the Haji had said, and to confirm Captain Burton's\r\nown prognostications drawn from the ancient sources which his extensive\r\nlearning enabled him to consult. The adventures of the party fill the\r\nremainder of the first of his two books and form extremely pleasant\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nThe second of the two books contains somewhat less antiquarian research,\r\nbut more practical information than the first. It is a record of the\r\nsecond expedition (also equipped at the expense of the Egyptian\r\nGovernment by order of the ex-Khedive), and is full of pleasant\r\ntravel-talk and adventure. Setting out from Cairo in a sickly season and\r\nunder the most unfavourable circumstances--the resources of the country\r\nbeing drained by distress at home and the Turkish-Russian war\r\nabroad--they at length got under way once more for the desert, not\r\nwithout encountering hair-breadth escapes from the bursting of some of\r\nthe tubes of the engine of their steamer. Once landed, the initial\r\ndifficulties of desert travel had to be encountered. \"It had been\r\nreported,\" says Captain Burton, \"that I was the happy possessor of\r\n£22,000, mostly to be spent in El-Muwaylah. The unsettled Arabs plunder\r\nand slay; the settled Arabs slander and cheat.\" These, however, were\r\nsoon smoothed over by the commander's tact and firmness, the rival\r\nclaims of two tribes to act as escort were disposed of, and the work of\r\nthe expedition then began.\r\n\r\nThe first march, through Madyan proper (North Midian), occupied\r\nfifty-four days. The country was essentially a mining district, and very\r\nrich in mineral wealth, though, strange to say, it had not been much\r\nworked by the ancients. The first expedition found free gold in the\r\nbasalt, but the researches of the second yielded none. The second march,\r\nthrough South Midian, lasted eighteen days. Its principal object was to\r\nascertain the depth from east to west of the quartz formations, and to\r\nexplore the virgin region towards the east. Here, however, they were\r\nstopped by the exactions and turbulent conduct of the Maazeh, who tried\r\nto pick quarrels with their Huweitat guides, and made it impossible for\r\nCaptain Burton to proceed without such loss of time and other\r\ninconveniences as must have sacrificed the other and more important\r\nobjects of the expedition. The last journey was through the southern\r\nportion of Midian, and lasted twenty-four days. This part of the country\r\nhas been systematically worked in former times, and it is here that the\r\ngold and silver mines are placed by the mediæval Arab geographers.\r\n\r\nThroughout Midian, ruined towns, villages, mining stations, and smelting\r\nfurnaces were found, testifying to the former mining industry of the\r\ncountry, and described by Captain Burton in his usual graphic and\r\ncareful style.\r\n\r\nThat Midian abounds in mineral wealth, and that gold and silver may be\r\nfound in plenty there, is clear both from the documentary evidence of\r\nthe author and from the testimony of the physical and geological\r\nfeatures of the country. The very first reconnaissance showed a\r\nformation exactly reproducing \"the conditions which Australia shows, and\r\nwhich produced the huge 'welcome nugget' of Ballarat.\" The country also\r\nclosely resembles the known gold-working sites of Ancient Egypt, but\r\nwith _filons_ of larger size. Some of these \"Ophirs of Egypt Proper\"\r\nyielded the treasury of Ramses the Great the enormous sum of £90,000,000\r\na year, as hieroglyphic inscriptions tell us. Herodotus, too, tells us\r\nof the immense wealth in the precious metals possessed by some of the\r\nPharaohs. The modern Bedawins have legends of \"gold pieces, square as\r\nwell as round, bearing, by way of inscription, 'prayers' to the Apostle\r\nof Allah,\" which Captain Burton suspects to be \"the Tibr, or 'pure\r\ngold-dust,' washed from the sands and cast probably in rude moulds.\" The\r\nclose proximity to the sea and the facilities of the country for\r\ntransport, it being \"prepared by Nature to receive a tramway,\" remove\r\nhalf the difficulties of working.\r\n\r\nThat the specimens brought back by Captain Burton's expedition did not\r\nactually yield a larger proportion of the precious metals is in all\r\nprobability due to the fact that they had no expert with them, and did\r\nnot, therefore, sufficiently seek for and select stone from the\r\nauriferous rocks, but brought away much that the ancients had rejected,\r\nor left as unworkable. He is, however, convinced, as the impartial\r\nreader of his work must also be, that the gold land of Midian is still a\r\nfine field for commercial enterprise, which would soon restore to it the\r\nadvantages which all ancient authorities declare that it once possessed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The Land of Midian\" attracted another explorer besides Captain\r\nBurton--namely, the late Dr. Beke, an account of whose labours has been\r\ngiven to the world by his widow in a bulky volume on the subject. His\r\nobject was to discover the \"true Mount Sinai,\" which he identified with\r\na certain Jebel Barguir, otherwise the \"Mountain of Light,\" on the\r\nEastern shore of the Gulf of Akaba, and in which he fancied he saw the\r\n\"volcano,\" the existence of which he had previously conjectured in his\r\npamphlet, \"Mount Sinai a Volcano.\" To make this theory accord with the\r\nScriptural account, he had not only to shift the scene of the Law-giving\r\nfrom the Sinaitic Peninsula to the other side of the Gulf, but he was\r\nobliged to find another Mizraim than Egypt, and boldly sacrificed\r\nhieroglyphic, Biblical, and classic testimony, as well as that of\r\ntradition, to his own hypothesis. In confirmation of his theory, he\r\nfound indications that the Mountain of Light was regarded as a holy\r\nplace, and discovered ancient inscriptions near the summit, of which he\r\nbrought copies home in triumph. Unfortunately, however, the name\r\n_Barguir_ turns out to be his own corruption of _Bakir_, a well-known\r\nMohammedan name, and, in the present instance, that of the petty Arab\r\nsaint whose tomb gives the only sanctity the mountain may possess, while\r\nthe proper name of the mountain is Jebel el Yitm; the inscriptions are\r\nonly the ordinary Nabathæan _graffiti_ and Arab-tribe marks, which are\r\nso common all over Arabia Petræa; and lastly, there is no volcano at\r\nall. The volume is interesting, as it contains much topographical\r\ninformation about a country the ancient history and future prospects of\r\nwhich render it of the highest importance; but as a contribution to the\r\nliterature of the much-vexed question of the Exodus the late Dr. Beke's\r\nwork is absolutely useless. Whether the so-called Peninsula of Sinai is\r\nreally the scene of the early portion of that drama, the recent Egyptian\r\nresearches of Dr. Brugsch Bey have rendered very doubtful; but wherever\r\nMount Sinai has ultimately to be placed, it is not that discovered by\r\nDr. Beke.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Burton supplemented the \"Unexplored Syria\" of her husband and\r\nthe late C. F. Tyrwhitt Drake with her own more personal but none the\r\nless interesting \"Inner Life of Syria,\" so she has now embodied her own\r\nimpression of the various localities which she and Captain Burton have\r\nvisited during the last few years in a pleasant book entitled, _A. E.\r\nI.: Arabia, Egypt, and India_ (London: W. Mullan & Son, 1879). Mrs.\r\nBurton's pages are eminently readable, her powers of observation are\r\nkeen, and her descriptions always fresh and vivid. If the spots she\r\nwrites about have been often before depicted by pen and pencil, she yet\r\nfinds something new to say, and some interesting and little-known\r\nhistorical incident to narrate, concerning them. The latter part of the\r\nbook, containing a history and description of the old Portuguese\r\nsettlement of Goa, and a minutely-detailed account of the life and works\r\nof St. Francis Xavier, the Apostle of the Indies, will be new to most\r\nreaders and read with interest by all. The book is one which may be\r\ntaken up at any moment with the certainty of finding something to amuse,\r\ninstruct, or furnish food for earnest thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Egypt to Palestine_, by S. C. Bartlett, though bearing the name and\r\naddress of a London publisher (Sampson Low, Marston, & Co.) on the\r\ntitle-page, is evidently the production of an American firm, the name of\r\nwhich, indeed, appears on some of the maps. The book is well got up, and\r\nas a description of the localities, their antiquities and history, is\r\nequal to the average of such publications. It is, however, entirely\r\ncomposed of materials collected from the works of other authors, taken\r\noften without acknowledgment, and is profusely illustrated by pictures\r\nand maps copied from other works, the sources of which are never\r\nacknowledged at all. The only passages at all original in the work are\r\nthose which describe Mr. Bartlett's own journey, the highest interest of\r\nwhich consists in an occasional enumeration of the hymns he and his\r\ncompanions sang to the Arabs (cf. p. 193), and which would have much the\r\nsame effect on the Tiyahah as the performances of the howling dervishes\r\nhave upon an American tourist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Lewis Pelly has published, in two handsome volumes, a literal\r\ntranslation of the text of the _Miracle Play of Hasan and Husein_\r\n(London: W. H. Allen & Co., 1879), as performed throughout India and\r\nPersia during the month of Mohurram, by the Shiah Mohammedans. The\r\nprogress of Islam in its early days was so rapid that, in a short time,\r\nit had overwhelmed Persia, Egypt, Syria, and a large portion of the rest\r\nof the Byzantine Empire in its tide of conquest. The death of Mohammed\r\nnaturally brought forward rival claimants to the supreme authority, and\r\nthe dispute ultimately resolved itself into one between Ali, the cousin\r\nand son-in-law of the Prophet, and representative of the Hashimi clan,\r\nand Moawiyeh, the representative of the Ommayeh family, between whom and\r\nthe Hashimis an old feud existed, originating in their rival claims to\r\nbe the hereditary guardians of the Kaabeh Temple at Mecca. These two\r\nparties offered an obvious rallying point for the two opposing factions\r\nin El Islam, the conquered Persians and the conquering Arabs, the former\r\nof whom resisted the traditional ceremonial law with which their Semitic\r\nco-religionists would have trammelled them. The consequence was that the\r\nAryan faction rallied round Ali, and the Arabs round Moawiyeh. The\r\nlatter proved the stronger party, and were known as Sunnis, followers of\r\nthe Sunnah or traditional law, while the adherents of the former were\r\ndesignated Shiahs or Sectarians, and thus originated the first great\r\nschism in Mohammedanism. The struggles of Ali's party for supremacy, his\r\nown murder, and the subsequent massacre of his sons, Hasan and Husein,\r\nwho lost their lives under circumstances of peculiar atrocity, are the\r\nincidents on which the drama is founded, and the memory of which has\r\nkept alive the rancorous ill-feeling between the two sects. In the play\r\nitself the historical element is largely mixed with the marvellous and\r\nlegendary, and the dramatic unities are wholly neglected; but it\r\nnevertheless exhibits enough of the real facts to give it an intense\r\nliving interest, while the antiquated language and strange incidents\r\nthat are introduced carry us back to the remotest times. An admirable\r\nintroduction contains a notice by Dr. Birdwood, C.S.I., of the origin\r\nof the Shiah schism, and of the ceremonies with which the Mohurram\r\nfestival is celebrated throughout India and Persia; and Mr. A. N.\r\nWollaston, of the India Office, has both edited the text and illustrated\r\nit with some concise and appropriate notes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Charles Riew has just issued the first volume of his _Catalogue of\r\nthe Persian MSS. in the British Museum_ (London: 1879), containing\r\nChristian and Mohammedan Theology, and the works on History and\r\nGeography of which the Museum has a large and important collection.\r\nAmongst these are the _Jámi ut tawárikh_, written in the seventh--eighth\r\ncenturies of the Hejra, and comprising the histories of all the\r\nprincipal Turkish and Mongol dynasties; the _Táríkh i Rashídí_, a\r\nhistory of the Khans of Mogolistan and of the Amirs of Kashgar; and the\r\n_Zafar Namah_, the earliest authentic history of Timur, written by his\r\norder in 1404 A.D. A brief but complete analysis of each manuscript is\r\ngiven, enabling scholars to refer at once and without difficulty to any\r\nportion of the histories without the labour of looking through an often\r\nvoluminous manuscript. The value of such a scholar-like production as\r\nthis Catalogue is cannot be over-estimated; it has, in fact, placed\r\nwithin reach of the student of history most important and authentic\r\nworks, the very existence of which was unknown except to a few\r\nOrientalists. The second volume is already complete in MS., and will be\r\nshortly published. We shall look forward to it with great interest, as\r\nthe British Museum possesses a magnificent collection of Persian\r\npoetical and other works.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA _Pahlavi Dictionary_, by Dastur Jamaspji Minocheherji Jamasp Asana, of\r\nwhich the first two volumes have just appeared (London: Trübner and Co.,\r\n1879), supplies a want long felt by students of the old Persian speech.\r\nPahlavi is the name applied to the old Persian tongue, and more\r\nparticularly to that phase of it which was spoken during the reigns of\r\nthe Sassanian kings. It is of great interest to the philologist,\r\ninasmuch as it contains a large admixture of Semitic words, derived,\r\nhowever, from a different source than the Arabic element in modern\r\nPersian, and appears to be akin to the Assyrian. It is sometimes called\r\n_Huzvaresh_, though this word seems to be more properly applied to a\r\nparticular method of reading, by which, when a Semitic word occurs in\r\nthe text, the priest _reads_ the Aryan equivalent, just as we in English\r\nsay \"pounds, shillings, and pence\" when we meet with the signs £ s. d.,\r\nand _read_ \"namely,\" though we write and print \"videlicet\" or \"viz.\"\r\nDastur Jamaspji Asana interprets the word _Huzvaresh_ to mean the\r\n\"language of Assyria,\" a suggestion which, if correct, throws some light\r\non the origin of the language. The etymology of the word Pahlavi has\r\nbeen the subject of much discussion, but the latest as well as the most\r\nreasonable conjecture is that of Dr. Haug (followed by the author of\r\nthis Dictionary), that it is identical with _Parthva_, the Parthia of\r\nthe classical writers; that most warlike and important nation having\r\ngiven its name to the language, just as the province of Pars has given\r\nthe name to the language of modern Iran. The great difficulty in\r\ncompiling such a dictionary as the present, apart from the\r\nunsatisfactory nature of the available texts, is that the alphabet is so\r\nvery vague and confused. The language contains a very great number of\r\nsounds which the alphabet, borrowed from the Semitic, is incapable of\r\nexpressing; the same letter, therefore, is often used for different\r\nsounds, and combinations of the various letters again often express\r\nsimple sounds. This makes the arrangement very difficult, but the author\r\nof this work has adopted the only safe method, that of arranging the\r\nwords according to the alphabetical order of the letters rather than in\r\norder of sounds. A table, in which the various combinations of the\r\nletters are explained, also much simplifies reference. The author has in\r\nall cases followed the traditional reading and interpretation of words,\r\nleaving to the more critical scholars of Europe the task of\r\ninvestigating them from a scientific point of view.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Haug's _Essays on the Sacred Language, Writings, and Religion of the\r\nParsis_ (Trübner's Oriental Series, 1878) is another most important\r\ncontribution to comparative theology and philology. The nature of the\r\ndoctrines of Zoroaster and the rites and ceremonies of the Magians had\r\nfor centuries exercised the uninitiated. The earliest mention of them\r\noccurs in the Prophet Jeremiah (xxxix. 3), who speaks of the _rab mag_\r\n(chief of the Magi) as forming part of the retinue of Nebuchadnezzar at\r\nhis entry into Jerusalem; Ezekiel calls the Persian king Cyrus (who\r\nprofessed the religion of the Magi) the \"anointed of the Lord;\" the New\r\nTestament speaks of Magi from the East--translated \"wise men\" in our\r\nversion--as the first to pay homage to our Lord; and the old Persian\r\nlanguage has supplied, through the New Testament also, the name\r\nParadise, which is universally employed to represent heaven throughout\r\nthe civilized world. Herodotus also mentions them, and testifies to the\r\npurity of their worship and their morals, and other Greek as well as\r\nLatin writers have treated at more or less length on the subject of the\r\nMagi. But these scattered and incomplete notices were all that scholars\r\nhad until Hyde, the celebrated Oxford scholar, in 1700, collected all\r\nthe ancient sources of information into a volume _Historia religionis\r\nveterum Persarum eorumque Magorum_. The original texts of the Zend\r\nAvesta, &c., however, of which some manuscripts had been brought to\r\nEurope, were still sealed books, and the Parsi priests in India and\r\nPersia strictly refrained from affording any information upon their\r\ncontents. At length, in 1754, Anquetil Duperron, an enterprising\r\nFrenchman, undertook a journey to India with the express intention of\r\nprocuring manuscripts and learning the Zend language, in both of which\r\npurposes he succeeded, and published ten years later the first known\r\ntranslation of the Zend Avesta. His work was by many scholars, Sir\r\nWilliam Jones and Richardson, the Persian lexicographer, amongst the\r\nnumber, regarded as worthless, Richardson maintaining that the texts\r\nthemselves were forgeries, while Sir William Jones endeavoured to prove\r\nthat Anquetil had been the victim of priestly fraud and deception.\r\nNearly a century later Eugene Burnouf, an eminent French Sanscrit\r\nscholar, proved his countryman's work to be genuine, corrected many of\r\nhis faults, and placed the study on a sounder scientific basis. Others,\r\nespecially German and Scandinavian _savants_, followed in the same path,\r\nforming, however, different schools of interpretation, until at last Dr.\r\nMartin Haug brought order into the confusion, and succeeded in bringing\r\nthe study of Zend within the limits of exact philological science. The\r\nfoundation of all these studies must of course necessarily be the\r\ntraditional interpretation handed down by the Parsi priests, but this\r\nwould have been comparatively useless without the investigation of\r\nEuropean scholars. Many of the Avesta texts are furnished with Pahlavi\r\ntranslations and comments, but the Pahlavi itself was but imperfectly\r\nunderstood, and the whole subject was for a long time in hopeless\r\nconfusion; the reader may, however, take up Dr. Haug's Essays with the\r\nfull assurance that he has the most trustworthy account of the Parsis,\r\ntheir Scriptures, history, and religious rites, that can be now\r\nascertained. Anything like a _résumé_ of such a work would be out of\r\nplace here, but we can cordially recommend it as, with all its recondite\r\nerudition, a most readable book.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernard Quaritch, of Piccadilly, has published a romance in modern\r\nArabic, entitled, _The Autobiography of the Constantinople\r\nStory-teller_, edited by Mr. J. Catafago, a well-known Arabic scholar,\r\nand said to be the work of an Englishman, Colonel Rous. It is\r\nprincipally as a curiosity of literature that it will be read, as it\r\ndoes not narrate any very novel or original adventures, and the style is\r\nvery simple and unpretending. It, however, contains some clear and\r\nconcise descriptions of many localities in the East which are but little\r\nknown to the ordinary reader, and will be welcome to the student of\r\nArabic as an easy text-book of the language.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor James Sanua, late of Cairo, is an enthusiastic politician and\r\nan original satirist. We have just received thirty numbers of an Arabic\r\ncomic paper, written, illustrated, and published by him in Paris, and\r\ndirected against the ex-Khedive of Egypt, whose misgovernment he\r\nmercilessly exposes, and whose deposition it was his avowed object to\r\nbring about. The editor, a native of Egypt, and a Copt by religion, was\r\nfor many years engaged in tuition in some of the highest families of\r\nCairo. Possessing a keen sense of humour and a great mastery over the\r\nArabic language, he used to pass his evenings in improvising a sort of\r\ndramatic entertainment, in which he himself sustained all the\r\ncharacters, and in which he satirized the social foibles of his\r\nfellow-countrymen. The originality of his _séances_ soon attracted large\r\naudiences, and amongst the visitors and admirers were the Khedive and\r\nthe princes of his family. The opportunity was too good to be lost, and\r\nProfessor Sanua passed from mere social topics, and administered sound\r\nand severe castigations to his august visitor for his misgovernment and\r\noppression of the fellaheen. This boldness drew down upon him the\r\ndispleasure of Ismail Pasha, and Abu Naddára Zerka (the Father of Blue\r\nSpectacles), as he was nicknamed, found it convenient to withdraw to\r\nParis, where he published his paper. It is written for the most part in\r\nthe vulgar Egyptian dialect, and contains articles upon, and\r\nillustrations of, the principal events of the latter part of the reign\r\nof the deposed prince. The pictures, which are rude, but full of force,\r\nare explained in a French introduction, which is prefixed to the\r\ncollected thirty numbers, and form a very interesting and curious record\r\nof modern Egyptian history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new paper, literary and political, has just been advertised at\r\nConstantinople. It is to be written in the Arabic language, and edited\r\nby M. G. Dellal, a native of Aleppo, and an accomplished Arabic scholar\r\nand poet. Modern Arabic literature is exceedingly plentiful at the\r\npresent time, and Beyrout has long been a centre of activity. Sheikh\r\nNasyf el Yazji, who died some few years ago, gave a great impulse to the\r\nstudy of Arabic by his \"Majma' el Bahrain,\" a book in imitation of the\r\n\"Macamat\" of Harírí, and containing in a small compass more information\r\non the Arabs of the classical period, their customs, histories,\r\nproverbs, &c., than perhaps any other work. Dr. Butrus Bustani, of the\r\nsame town, earned for himself a lasting name by his Arabic lexicon,\r\n\"Muhít el Muhít,\" which has not only a native but a European reputation;\r\nand the same eminent scholar has established a press, from which have\r\nemanated many standard Arabic works, and numerous translations of\r\nvaluable European works on science and history. A magazine entitled _El\r\nJinán_, \"The Garden of Paradise,\" is also published there fortnightly,\r\nand contains, besides political articles and general news, a great deal\r\nof interesting miscellaneous information. The last important publication\r\nof the \"Matba' al Maarif,\" or \"Scientific Press,\" as it is called, is an\r\nEncyclopædia in the Arabic language, on the plan of the European\r\nConversation-lexicons.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[105] The Sixth was never heard of after the massacre of its officers; a\r\ndozen men were enough for that work, and there are those still living\r\nwho believe that the per-centage of traitors in its ranks was small. At\r\nBenares, too, the mess-guard held the mess-premises against all comers\r\ntill the station was quiet, and then through sheer terror marched off\r\nwithout plunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--CLASSICAL LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n(_Under the Direction of the_ Rev. Prebendary J. DAVIES, M.A.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful volumes for classical students which has seen the\r\nlight this year is the solid collection of _Specimens of Roman\r\nLiterature, illustrative of Roman Thought and Style_, edited by Messrs.\r\nCruttwell and Banton, of Bradfield College, and published by C. Griffin\r\nand Co. Mr. Cruttwell is creditably known for his compendious History of\r\nRoman Literature, and it is a happy afterthought of himself and his\r\ncomposition-master to supplement that manual by the present collection\r\nof extracts from Latin prose and poetry, designed as models for\r\ncomposition, samples to be learnt by rote, and exercises in unseen\r\ntranslation. The work contains above 900 passages, illustrative (1) of\r\nRoman thought in the fields of religion, philosophy, art, and letters;\r\nand (2) of Roman style, from the earliest date to the times of the\r\nAntonines. Edited of necessity, by reason of their bulk, sans note or\r\ncomment, these selections are availably grouped in a preliminary\r\nsynopsis, happily headed with descriptive and apposite English titles,\r\nand further adapted to English reference by an index of authors classed\r\nin their periods, and another of subjects and titles of passages. It is\r\nhard to conceive a completer or handier repertory of specimens of Latin\r\nthought and style, and it is but fair to add that no small proportion of\r\nthe contents is comparatively novel and unhackneyed, a boon at the same\r\ntime to the exhausted composition tutor and to the acquisition-seeking,\r\nwideawake pupil. For example, among descriptions selected in\r\nillustration of style, we come upon passages from Ennius, Pacuvius, and\r\nAccius, preserved in Cicero's De Divinatione and De Naturâ Deorum,\r\nfollowed by epigrams of those elder poets, Valerius OEdituus, Porcius\r\nLicinus, and Quintus Lutatius Catulus, embalmed in the antiquarian pages\r\nof Aulus Gellius. The literature of Roman agriculture is represented (§§\r\n31-4) by specimens of Varro de Re Rusticâ, directing how to choose the\r\nbest oxen for draught, or slaves for farm work; how to make a duck-pond,\r\nor prepare a snail-bed; as well as of Columella and, of course, Virgil.\r\nPliny's natural history is taxed largely for characteristic\r\ncontributions: the letters of his nephew, as well as of Seneca and\r\nCicero, for epistolary style, as well as for philosophy, religious\r\nviews, and the like. Lucretius and Catullus are excellently represented:\r\nas in the field of Roman drama are Plautus and Terence, with fragments\r\nof elder playwrights. Nor is scant justice done to the purely Roman\r\nfield of satire, as is seen in apt extracts from Horace, Juvenal, and\r\nPersius, whilst a happy selection is made of producible specimens of\r\nPetronius. Even Roman parody is not overlooked, nor yet an insight into\r\nRoman gastronomy. In fact, we know not where to turn for defaults in the\r\npresence of such assiduous and various compilations. Here and there may\r\nbe detected careless printers' errors, such as _Tar_ for _Ter_. (the\r\nabbreviation of Terence); and it would have been neater to head the\r\nhortatory or suasory orations, illustrated in pp. 567-8, §§ 73-5, with\r\nan English title, rather than to describe each in mingled and maimed\r\nspeech as \"a suasoria\" (_i.e._, \"suasoria oratio.\") But the work is so\r\ncalculated to be useful to scholars and editors that we must trust its\r\nvalue will be enhanced in future editions by the most careful revision.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA volume of somewhat kindred use and purpose, though of additional value\r\nas suggestive of a standard of translation indisputably sound and high,\r\nis the collection of _Translations_, by Professor Jebb, Mr. Jackson, and\r\nMr. Currey, of Trinity, Cambridge, published by Deighton, Bell, & Co.,\r\nCambridge, and George Bell & Sons, London, just a year ago. Its\r\nusefulness is enhanced by a fourfold applicability to the wants of\r\ntranslators into Greek and Latin, and out of those languages into\r\nEnglish, whether in prose or poetry. The samples are, of course, limited\r\nconsiderably by the area of the field they cover, but they will be\r\nadmitted to be amply sufficient for models and patterns, and no tiro, or\r\neven advanced student, can fail to be benefited by the variety,\r\nexcellent choice, scholarly handling, brief but seasonable annotation,\r\nand general accommodation to student-use, of the selections which form\r\nthe four divisions of this practical manual. The rule of \"Ne quid nimis\"\r\nhas been sufficiently respected to forbid tedious reiteration of types\r\nof the same style, so that in Greek verse into English only three\r\nexamples of Theocritus occur, one a sweet piece of idyllic description,\r\na second illustrative of the mimes of Sophron, a third breathing the\r\nAlexandrian tone of poetic stimulus to the halting liberality of the\r\nwould-be literary Ptolemies. The proportion of extracts from Homer and\r\nthe dramatists is scarcely larger, and rather guides the reader to form\r\na criterion of style for himself than helps him to be armed beforehand\r\nfor passages which may be set in this or that examination. In\r\ntranslation the canon of accuracy and fidelity is tendered in preference\r\nto that of liveliness and effect, though it cannot be said that Messrs.\r\nJebb and Jackson's translations from Plautus and Terence, or those of\r\nJebb and Currey from Martial, Juvenal, and Ausonius, are deficient in\r\nthe life and spirit suggested by the originals. As much may be said\r\nwithout controversy for the prose models in either language; nor is it\r\nto be lightly regarded that the aim of the editors has been to help\r\nclassical students to train themselves in preparation for examination.\r\nNot to be prolix in notice of a volume which may be referred to again\r\nand again in our examination of texts and school-books to follow in our\r\nchronicle, it may be admissible to quote in Latin and English some six\r\nlines of Professor Jebb's translation from the Phormio (pp. 140-1) as a\r\ntype of the neatness and spirit of the average of these translations.\r\nPhormio is explaining how, with all his ebullitions, he has never been\r\nindicted for assault:--\r\n\r\n    \"Quia non rete accipitri tenditur neque miluo,\r\n    Qui male faciunt nobis: illis qui nihil faciunt tenditur;\r\n    Quia enim in illis fructus est, in illis opera luditur.\r\n    Aliis aliunde est periclum unde aliquid abradi potest:\r\n    Mihi sciunt nihil esse. Dices, ducent damnatum domum:\r\n    Alere nolunt hominem edacem: et sapiunt, meâ quidem sententia,\r\n    Pro maleficio si beneficium summum nolunt reddere.\"\r\n        _Phorm._, act. ii. 2.\r\n\r\n\"Because we do not spread nets for hawks and kites that do us harm; the\r\nnet is spread for the harmless birds. The fact is, pigeons may be\r\nplucked: hawks and kites mock our pains. Various dangers beset people\r\nwho can be pilfered--I am known to have nothing. You will say, 'They\r\nwill get a writ of _habeas corpus_.' They would rather not keep a large\r\neater: and I certainly think they are right to decline requiting a bad\r\nturn with a signal favour.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom a summary notice of these two volumes of wider range and scope, it\r\nis an easy leap to such noteworthy classical translations and texts of\r\nthe year or season as lie on our table for review. Of the former we note\r\nwith satisfaction a new and very readable version of _The Letters of the\r\nYounger Pliny_, literally translated by John Delaware Lewis, M.A.\r\n(London: Trubner & Co., 1879), whose version of Juvenal's Satires some\r\nyears back was accurate, lively, and well-achieved. In approaching\r\nanother author of the silver age, well deserving of a more modern\r\nEnglish transcript than those of Melmoth and Lord Orrery, Mr. Lewis has\r\nbeen minded to present this pleasantest of gossips, and most cultured of\r\nletter-writers, in a guise as little as possible encumbered with notes\r\nor excursions, and in such wise that the volume is admirably adapted for\r\nthe library table, whether the object be comparison with the Latin text,\r\nor refreshment of the memory, anent this or that sentiment of the\r\nmany-sided and voluminous man of law and letters. Under the conviction\r\nthat enough has been done to present Pliny himself to his readers in the\r\nvolumes by Church and Brodribb (in the Ancient Classics), and by\r\nPritchard and Bernard, as well as the notices of life and letters by W.\r\nS. Teuffel and English bibliographers, Mr. Lewis has confined himself to\r\nthe briefest of introductions, and been content to bestow most pains on\r\napt and parallel English counterparts to the expressions and idioms of\r\nthe Latin. Thus the task undertaken has been made to assume an easy,\r\nunaffected form, at the same time that it is calculated to stand close\r\nexamination by the criterion of the Latin text. A good specimen both of\r\nthe gossiping author and his latest translator might be cited from Book\r\nII. 6 to Avitus, in which is described the triple-graded dinner given by\r\na shabby, purse-proud host (=a=) to himself and his intimates, (=b=) to\r\nhis lesser friends, (=g=) to his freedmen at the same board, but of fare\r\ngraduated according to degree. Pliny tells his correspondent that he\r\ndemurred to this procedure to his next neighbour at table, and\r\npropounded his own practice on this wise: \"I invite people to dine, not\r\nto be invidiously ticketed, and I treat as my entire equals in all\r\nrespects those whom I have already made my equals by inviting them at my\r\ntable.\" And this equality, for the time being, he extended to his\r\nfreedmen, on the sensible point of view that they were then his guests,\r\nnot his freedmen. In the same book (letter 15) occurs a letter of Pliny\r\nto Valerianus, brief enough for quotation, and yet expressing with\r\nlively brevity more than one home truth for those who realize Horace's\r\nsketch, \"O si angulus iste proximus accedat.\" \"How,\" he asks, \"does your\r\nold Marsian property treat you? And your new purchase? Are you pleased\r\nwith the estate now that it is your own? Indeed, nothing is so agreeable\r\nwhen you have once got it, as it was when you longed to have it. As for\r\nme, the farms which I inherited from my mother treat me but so-so: yet\r\nthey delight me as coming from my mother; and besides, long endurance\r\nhas hardened me: constant growling comes to this at last, that one is\r\nashamed to growl.\" Next but one to this letter comes one of those\r\ncharming descriptions which are, _par excellence_, Pliny's _chefs\r\nd'oeuvre_, minutely detailing the features and attractions of his\r\nvillas. These constitute to the young student so many _loci classici_,\r\nby no means to be overlooked in preparation for facing the test-paper of\r\na scholarship examination, and it is sound counsel to candidates for\r\nsuch to avail themselves of a translation like Mr. Lewis's for general\r\npurposes, taking such letters as the one alluded to (II. xvii.) for\r\nspecial study and comparison with its original. Here, as elsewhere, Mr.\r\nLewis adds pertinent and sensible notelets in cases of difficulty; but\r\nit is only fair to say _à propos_ of the, as he would seem to imply in\r\nhis preface, long-since shelved translation of Melmoth, that in Bohn's\r\nClassical Library (George Bell & Sons) will be found a revision and\r\ncorrection of _The Letters of Caius Plinius Coecilius Secundus_, as\r\ntranslated by Melmoth, annotated and otherwise accommodated to modern\r\nreading by the Rev. F. C. T. Bosanquet, B.A., of Gonville and Caius\r\nCollege, Cambridge, which will be found in all respects excellently\r\nsuited for the need of the current reader. Whilst here and there the\r\nstyle of Melmoth strikes us as forgetting itself for a brief space,\r\nwhere the modern editor has felt bound to interpose a more literal\r\nrendering, and in such cases it is simpler to refer to the uniform\r\ntranslation of Lewis, it is certainly a real boon to have the notes of\r\nBosanquet's Melmoth's Pliny to consult, whether they represent the\r\nexplanatory and illustrative labour of Melmoth, and his literary or\r\nantiquarian contemporaries, or the careful supplementary illustrations\r\nof his accommodator to modern eyes. So much explanation is due to one of\r\nthe best recent volumes of Bohn's Classical Series (1878).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe feeling is more mixed with which we touch upon Mr. T. Hart Davies's\r\n_Translation of Catullus into English Verse_ (London: C. Kegan Paul &\r\nCo., 1879), the author of which is a quondam Oxonian in the Indian Civil\r\nService. Fully persuaded that Catullus is very untranslatable, and that\r\nthe subtle charm of his dainty versification evaporates, it is evidence\r\nalike of Mr. Hart Davies's courage and culture that, afar from classical\r\nlibraries, he has recreated his mind and tastes with the reproduction of\r\none of the most genuine classical poets; given us anew the touching\r\nsongs to Lesbia, and the unequalled nuptial songs (lxi. and lxii.); and\r\nrendered with more or less success the pictorial epic, in petto, of the\r\nmarriage of Peleus and Thetis, and the pathetic allusions to an\r\nearly-lost brother in the poem to Hortalus. He deserves, too, the praise\r\nof having read carefully the recent literature of the subject, and\r\nguaged with creditable acuteness and discrimination the lucubrations of\r\nProfessor R. Ellis, the criticisms of Mr. Munro, and the critical essays\r\nof Schwabe, Heyse, and Couat. He hesitates, however, it would seem, to\r\naccept Munro's well-sustained rehabilitation of Cæsar and Mamurra (_à\r\npropos_ of Poem xxix. on Cæsar), and in two or three passages seems to\r\nus to err in point of prolixity, which is as foreign as can be conceived\r\nto the style of his original, as well as, in one or two places, in\r\nmisconception of his sense. In either aspect, he cannot be regarded as\r\ncompeting (which indeed he does not aspire to do) with Theodore Martin:\r\nbut we cannot honestly say that we regard his version of the Atys as an\r\nimprovement in readableness on that of one of the ablest of critics, but\r\nmost puzzling and hopeless of verse-translators, Professor Robinson\r\nEllis. Indeed, it is a question whether he has imported any improvement\r\ninto the rendering of his Galliambics by adopting the Tennysonian rather\r\nthan the Catullian rhythm and measure. Mr. Hart Davies is mostly happy\r\nin his shorter versions. The invitation to Cæcilius is bright and brisk\r\n(p. 33): there is a touching sadness in the lines to Cornificius (p.\r\n35). The stanzas to the poet's self on the \"Coming of Spring\" (p. 43)\r\nbreathe much of the tiptoe of expectation and love of adventure infused\r\ninto the original lines. And as a neat sample of the translator's muse\r\nmay be quoted the transcript of the \"Lines to Sirmio,\" adequately\r\nexecuted, and endorsed with some of the original pathos and\r\npicturesqueness--\r\n\r\n    \"Sirmio, fairest of all isles that be,\r\n      Or all peninsulas that ocean laves,\r\n    Whether around them roll the mighty sea,\r\n          Or a lake's placid waves.\r\n    Thee with what joy, what rapture do I view,\r\n      Returned from Thynia and Bithynia's plain!\r\n    I scarce can credit that the bliss is true\r\n          Thee to behold again.\r\n    Oh! what more blessed is than labours past!\r\n      In weary wanderings abroad we roam,\r\n    Then spent with toil we come again at last,\r\n          Seeking our rest at home.\r\n    This for our toils the sole reward is found,\r\n      Hail, lovely Sirmio, and thou Lydian mere!\r\n    And now, my home, let all thy laughter sound,\r\n          Now is thy master here.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hart Davies's temporary exile has obviously the solace of\r\nscholarship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf a wide divergence from the beaten track into fresh fields and\r\npastures new be a merit, as it must be to jaded schoolmasters, if not to\r\nschool-boys, some praise should be accorded to Mr. Heitland, a Fellow\r\nand Lecturer of St. John's, Cambridge, and his coadjutor, Mr. Raven, for\r\nhaving furnished the Pitt Press Series with so good an edition of that\r\npart of the _History of Quintus Curtius_, which relates to the Indian\r\nexpedition of Alexander the Great. The subject, author, and hero are to\r\nmodern readers novel and unhackneyed: and there is that suspicion of\r\nimperfect knowledge attaching to all three which sets the mind on the\r\nqui vive to acquire what is knowable about them. For such an undertaking\r\nno better guides could be needed. An introduction primes the student\r\nwith the needful information (=a=) as to Curtius and his book; (=b=) as\r\nto Alexander's career; while Appendix D (187-9) supplements from Mr.\r\nTalboy Wheeler's \"History of India from the Earliest Ages\" the general\r\nand current information as to the plan of his Indian campaign. Anent the\r\ndate and authorship of Curtius's history, it is shown to be the work of\r\nQ. Curtius Rufus, a rhetorician of the reign of Claudius, and referable\r\nto the silver age of Latin literature. His transparent imitation of Livy\r\nhas suggested the not improbable supposition that he may have been even\r\nthat historian's pupil, nor is it an impertinent criticism of the\r\neditors' that in common with that master Curtius seems to ignore the\r\n\"high aims and farsightedness which give its grandeur to Alexander's\r\ncharacter.\" The string of notable usages in Curtius's style, given in\r\npp. 14-15, exhibits more than one palpable Livianism; and the use of\r\npoetical language bespeaks his attentive study of Virgil. Tiros will be\r\ncomforted by hearing that \"if Curtius is less pleasant to read than\r\nLivy, he is also less difficult.\" The criticisms of the editors on the\r\ngrounds of his historical value at the revival period are interesting\r\nand perspicuous, and the special interest of the particular portion of\r\nhistory adopted as a specimen of the author needs no apology in a\r\ncountry where the reigning sovereign has the collateral title of Empress\r\nof India. Six chapters of the eighth Book bring the reader through the\r\ncountry west of the Indus to the bank of that river, its passage, and\r\nthe ensuing battle on the eastern bank, with the defeat of the army of\r\nPorus; whilst the ninth Book embraces Alexander's advance through the\r\nPunjab, his operations in descending the Jhelam and Chenab, his descent\r\nof the Indus, and exploration of its mouth, with an account also of the\r\nhomeward march; and the least that can be said of Messrs. Heitland and\r\nRaven's editorial work, whether critical or explanatory, is, that no\r\ndifficulty of text is overlooked or imperfectly handled, no discrepancy,\r\nas comparing Curtius with parallel authorities, ignored. A test-passage,\r\nwherein to prove this statement, may be taken in the fourteenth chapter\r\nof the eighth Book, the battle between Alexander and Porus, which is\r\ndescribed with unflagging care and zeal from first to last, the\r\nsituations and details being compared, and, where possible, reconciled\r\nwith Arrian, the poetical phrases characteristic of Curtius pointed out\r\nand illustrated, and the unusual words, _e.g., copidas_ (\"choppers\" like\r\na Goorka knife, the =kopis= from the same root as =koptô=), clearly\r\nthough succinctly explained. On Alexander's order to Coenus in §§ 15 of\r\nthe battle chapter, \"ipse dextrum move et turbatis signa infer\" (advance\r\nthe right wing, &c.), an excellent note, for which Mr. Heitland\r\nundertakes the sole responsibility, accredits him, in our judgment, as a\r\nmost sound historical commentator, by the exhaustiveness wherewith he\r\nreconciles Arrian and Curtius's view of Alexander's position and\r\nmovements, and those of Coenus. The former with the main body took the\r\nIndian horse in flank, before they could change their front, and enabled\r\nCoenus to fall on what had been their front but was now their disordered\r\nflank: and as to the difficulty in the way of this explanation, that\r\naccording to Arrian the war-chariots were in front of the Indian horse,\r\nit is justly deemed easier to conceive Coenus eluding these clumsy\r\nadversaries, than Alexander expecting him to see from the Macedonian\r\nleft the right moment for his own charge, and then wheel round the whole\r\nIndian army, and execute his orders opportunely. With the same lucidity\r\nis the whole narrative commented on: and every geographical, historical,\r\nor military difficulty investigated, with a commendable eye both to\r\nancient and modern references and authorities. Equally interesting, too,\r\nwill be found the elucidations of questions of style, such as in viii.\r\n§§ 10, where \"igni _alita_ sepulchra\" reveals a certainly post-Augustan\r\nbut doubtfully Ciceronian form; or as in viii. 14 §§ 41 the use of\r\n\"malum\" (plague take you) borrowed interjectionally from the comic poets\r\nand, as is shown in the notes ad loc., from Cicero De Off. ii. §§ 53.\r\nStudents, however, must search this volume minutely to understand aright\r\nthe helps it affords to their just estimate of Quintus Curtius Rufus as\r\na rhetorical moralist and historian, worthy of perusal in the wake of\r\nLivy and of Seneca. Maps, indices, and list of names, are given, which\r\nwill be found of service.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor our next topic of criticism recourse must be had to Ciceronian\r\nLatin, and to the famous speech of Rome's greatest orator, which is\r\ngenerally reckoned the first of his public and political orations.\r\nCalled in the MSS. the speech \"De imperio Gnæi Pompeii\" \"apud Quirites\"\r\nit is better known as the oration _pro lege Maniliâ_, and because there\r\nis no compendious school edition of this speech, apart from others of\r\nthe same orator in the hands of English school-boys, Professor Wilkins,\r\nof Owens College, has judiciously undertaken to prepare an edition of\r\nit, with the cognizance, sanction, and assistance of Karl Halm, of\r\nMunich, and his smaller edition for English students. The English\r\nprofessor's name is a sufficient earnest of his work's thoroughness, and\r\nthough it might be matter of doubt whether his historical introduction\r\nof over forty pages is not unnecessarily circumstantial (we note that in\r\nChambers' preface to the same oration in the \"Ciceronis Selectæ\r\nOrationes,\" 1849, of their Educational Course, it is limited to two), it\r\nmust be admitted that a complete preliminary summary has the result of\r\nshortening afterwork by admitting of copious references to it in the\r\nnotes in place of explanation. Such is certainly the case with Mr.\r\nWilkins's present task (_M. Tullii Ciceronis De Imperio Gnoei Pompeii\r\nOratio ad Quirites_, by A. S. Wilkins, M.A., Professor of Latin in the\r\nOwens College, Manchester. London: Macmillan & Co., 1879), where the\r\nintroduction traces consecutively the career and campaigns and varying\r\nfortunes of Mithridates, during over twenty years, through his struggles\r\nwith Lucullus, and his easy resistance to Acilius Glabrio, down to the\r\nperiod when the tribune Manilius proposed a Bill to commit the conduct\r\nand consummation of the war to the then favourite of fortune, Pompey\r\nthe Great. Against this Bill were arrayed the Moderate Republicans, and\r\nthe talents of the orator Hortensius, whilst on behalf of it spoke\r\nJulius Cæsar, either with an eye to a future precedent in his own case,\r\nor perhaps to create a reaction. It is probable, however, that the\r\nmasterly eloquence of Cicero in defence of the Bill, and his exhaustive\r\ndemonstration of Pompey's fitness for the supreme command against\r\nMithridates, were the causes of the general and irresistible acceptance\r\nof the Manilian proposal. As Mr. Wilkins notes at the close of his\r\nintroduction, this speech contains the best example from antiquity of\r\nthe regular arrangement of a speech of the deliberate class, while the\r\nthird section of the argument presents a model of demonstrative oratory\r\nscarcely paralleled in the days of the Republic, except in the funeral\r\norations. As has been already remarked, the fulness of Professor\r\nWilkins's introduction tends to disencumber his commentary and its notes\r\nof digressive and indirect matter; and the result is highly favourable\r\nto the due mastery of the sense and gist of the oration by the patient\r\nstudent. Every passage has its critical difficulties explained; every\r\nuncommon construction or use of a word is noted; every antithesis is\r\npointed out by the observant editor. In the first class may be instanced\r\nthe use in c. ii. of _vectigalibus_ in the masculine gender for\r\n_tributaries_, which has its parallel in § 45; in the third the contrast\r\nin c. iii., between \"In Asiæ luce h.e,\" \"in the foreground of Asia,\"\r\n_lux_ being used of what is present to the eyes of all, and open to\r\nextensive commerce, as opposed to \"_Ponti latebris_,\" as the\r\nhiding-place of Mithridates is termed just before. In the same chapter\r\nthere is an antithesis, as is well shown in the description of past\r\ngenerals having carried off _insignia victoriæ, non victoriam_, \"only\r\ntriumphs, not a victory;\" and as a sample of other notes dealing with\r\nfiscal duties and such like, we may notice those in c. vi., on \"ubertate\r\nagrorum\" \"magnitudine pastionis,\" and the sources of revenue farmed by\r\nthe \"publicani.\" In the same passage _scriptura_ is the \"rent for\r\npasturage,\" and _custodiis_ (§ 16) = \"coastguard posts, to prevent\r\nvessel unloading unless at the emporia where there were custom-houses.\"\r\nFor _publicanis omissis_, a despaired-of reading in c. vii. § 18, the\r\neditor adopts the conjecture _publicanorum bonis_ or _fortunis amissis_;\r\nand indeed seldom fails in the likeliest cure for a corrupt word or\r\ntext. Incidentally he is rich in rules for orthography, as where on \"tot\r\nmilibus\" he cites Lachmann (Lucret. i. 313) for the use of the single\r\n_l_ where a long _i_ is followed by a short one in the next syllable;\r\nnor does he fail to note any memorable change of construction, _e.g._,\r\nwhere in c. xiii. in the sentence, \"_Hiemis_ enim non _avaritiæ_\r\nperfagium majores nostri in sociorum atque amicorum tectis esse\r\nvoluerunt,\" we have a change from the objective to the subjective\r\ngenitive, \"a refuge _from_ the winter, not _for_ avarice.\" But enough\r\nhas been said to signify the merit of this handbook; and we must deal\r\nmore briefly with such other Latin volumes as are still on our list.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong these perhaps Mr. Reid's Lælius (_M. Tullii Ciceronis Lælius de\r\nAmicitia_, by James S. Reid, M.L.: Cambridge University Press, 1879) is\r\nthe most notable, an edition based mainly on Seyffert's elaborate\r\nedition, yet evidently strengthened by seasonable comparison with the\r\nbest German editions. Mr. Reid disowns acquaintance with any English\r\nedition of the Lælius, having only heard of that of Mr. Arthur Sidgwick,\r\nwhen his own was far advanced through the press. The object and purpose\r\nof the edition is twofold, viz. (1) elucidation of the subject-matter\r\nand comparison of the editor's own conclusions touching it with those of\r\nother editing scholars; and (2) a thorough elucidation of the Latinity\r\nof the dialogue, a task to which all who are cognizant of his edition of\r\nCicero's speeches for Archias and for Balbus will admit his eminent\r\nfitness. A fourfold introduction summarises the salient points of\r\nCicero, as a writer of philosophy; the scope of this treatise on\r\n\"Friendship:\" the structure, personages, and other circumstances of the\r\ndialogue, and a quasi-dramatic analysis of the same. It will be found\r\nthat Cicero, whilst having no sympathy with the Epicurean philosophy of\r\nhis day, sided mainly with the Peripatetics, though inclining in a few\r\npoints of detail to the Stoics. An instructive disquisition on the\r\nsources of the dialogue opens out various clues to inquiring students,\r\nand suggests particularly minuter testing of the question how far Cicero\r\ndirectly imitated Plato's Lysis, which is perhaps more probable than\r\nthat he used for it the Nicomachean Ethics, although, in form, beyond a\r\ndoubt the Lælius is more Aristotelian than Platonic. The \"mitis\r\nsapientia Læli\" in the dialogue stands out in contrast with the genial\r\nlearning of Mucius Scævola and the severer cultivation of Gaius Fannius.\r\nAn interesting passage in the dialogue is that in which Lælius states a\r\nquestion relating to friendship, in which he was to some extent at issue\r\nwith Scipio, viz., the difficulty of friendship enduring a whole\r\nlifetime. Scipio held the negative view, and Lælius demurred to it, and\r\nin c. x., xi., &c., the occurrences which tend to break off friendship\r\nare enumerated. In the tenth chapter are to be found two or three very\r\napt elucidations of the text, such as that on the construction of\r\n\"contentione condicionis,\" and the sense of condicio (not \"conditio\") in\r\n§ 34, but one note (16) on \"optimis quibusque\" stands out as a sample of\r\nexhaustive criticism. The argument of Lælius is that there is no greater\r\ncurse in friendships than, in the run of men, the desire of money; in\r\nthe best, the desire of honour and glory: \"in optimis quibusque honoris\r\ncertamen et gloria.\" Let us see how Mr. Reid examines this last clause,\r\nwhich he compares with the sentiment, \"optimus quisque gloria maxime\r\nducitur,\" in the oration for Archias. The best authors, it is shown, use\r\nonly the _neuter_ plural of _quisque_, and that with a superlative; Cic.\r\nFam. vii. 33, where we have \"literas longissimas quasque,\" being\r\nexceptional, because literæ, \"an epistle,\" has no singular. Mr. Reid\r\ninstances, indeed, from the De Officiis ii. 75, \"Leges et proximæ quæque\r\nduriores,\" but only to propose an emendation to a senseless reading,\r\nviz., \"Leges, et proxima quæque\"--_i.e._, \"laws, and harsher each of\r\nthem than its predecessor.\" In the present case, he adds, \"quibusque\"\r\nmay be used for =hekastois= in the sense of \"each set of people,\" or the\r\nplural may be due merely to assimilation with \"plerisque.\" In a note on\r\nthe difficult passage, p. 41, \"et minime tum quidem Gaius frater, nunc\r\nidem acerrimus,\" Mr. Reid, rightly, it should seem, adopts the\r\ninterpretation of Madvig, Opusc., 2, 281, that _minime_ qualifies _acer_\r\nto be supplied from \"acerrimus.\" This sample of interpretational tact\r\nmust suffice from a copious inventory; and with reference to helpful\r\nelucidation of matter and illustration of proper names, quotations,\r\nadagia, and what not, it need only be said that it is in this edition\r\nalways sound and seasonable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the same employers, the Syndics of the Pitt Press, Mr. A. G.\r\nPeskett, M.A., of Magdalen College, has carefully edited the fourth and\r\nfifth books of Cæsar's Commentaries on the Gallic War, _Gai Juli Cæsaris\r\nDe Bello Gallico Commentariorum, IV. V._ (Cambridge University Press,\r\n1879), with a helpful commentary derived from study of German and\r\nEnglish editors, and speculations on the topographical, geographical,\r\nand astronomical problems involved in Cæsar's account. These books, it\r\nwill be remembered, contain _inter alia_ the description of Cæsar's\r\nBridge over the Rhine, his preparations for invading Britain, his first\r\nsomewhat abortive attempts, and then, after a winter in Italy and\r\nIllyricum, his maturer arrangements, and landing--not without damage to\r\nhis fleet--on the shore of Britain. The second of these campaigns\r\nembraces the narrative of the treachery of Ambiorix and the utter defeat\r\nof the Romans, v. 36-7. In the fourth book, one of the most interesting\r\nproblems is the construction of Cæsar's Rhine Bridge, c. 17; whether\r\nCæsar's method of strengthening the four bearing piles with their\r\ntransverse beams was (as Kraner and Heller practically agree) by four\r\nfibulæ at each junction of the beam with the piles (eight in all), or,\r\nas Cohausen believes, by two fibulæ at each end, one serving instead of\r\ncross-piece c, in fig. 1, for the beam to rest upon. Napoleon's view of\r\nthe fibulaæ, given in fig. 4, p. 63, is far less tenable, and the most\r\nreasonable view is that of Heller. In c. 36, Book V., note, we have good\r\nexamples of the actual words of Ambiorix to Titurius, as they may be\r\ngathered from the _oratio obliqua_ in which the historian casts them. In\r\nc. 37, it should seem that the reading _lapsi_ has less likelihood,\r\nthough better authority, than \"elapsi,\" and Napoleon's identification of\r\nthe site of the battle is shown to be accurate, in a note discussing the\r\ntopography of Tongres, the Geer, and the village of Lowaige. From a\r\ncursory examination of this edition of two interesting books of Cæsar's\r\nGallic War we should be disposed to congratulate the young student of\r\nintelligence, into whose hands a volume at once so helpful and so lucid\r\nmay fall. There remains on our list only one Latin volume, the third\r\npart of Professor Mayor's Juvenal for Schools, containing Satires X. and\r\nXI. But this, as well as a batch of recent editions of Greek plays and\r\nGreek authors, such as Xenophon, Lucian, &c., must be postponed until\r\nanother time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--ESSAYS, NOVELS, POETRY, &c.\r\n\r\n(_Under the Direction of_ MATTHEW BROWNE.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn referring to two more of Messrs. Macmillan and Co.'s _English Men of\r\nLetters_ we shall reproduce, reckless of the charge of \"damnable\r\niteration,\" the charge we have made before. Here is _Burke_, by Mr. John\r\nMorley, and _Hume_, by Professor Huxley, each volume containing over two\r\nhundred close pages; and most admirable volumes they are. But let us\r\nturn again to the prospectus and note its language: \"These Short Books\r\nare addressed to the general public with a view both of stirring and\r\nsatisfying an interest in literature and its great topics in the minds\r\nof those who have to run as they read.\" This language is both wide and\r\ncareful; the old metaphor may be read more or less loosely, of course;\r\nand it may be said that those who care much for Burke and Hume must be\r\nprovided for in the series, and that the writers who deal with them have\r\ntreated their topics as pleasantly as may be. We do not deny this, and\r\nthe little volumes are substantial additions to the literature of the\r\nday. But they are not for readers who have to run with their books in\r\ntheir hand.\r\n\r\nMr. John Morley's estimate of Burke is known to us all, and it is what\r\nmight be expected. As a philosophical politician, and as a speculative\r\nwriter in general, Burke, of course, pleases Mr. Morley by the positive\r\ntendencies of his mind. We are pleased to see that he assigns its due\r\nrank to the too often underrated Inquiry about the Sublime and\r\nBeautiful. But Mr. Morley has perhaps the fault which Sterne told his\r\nfriend the Count belonged especially to the French; he is \"too serious.\"\r\nOf course, Burke is a great man, and one must not cut jokes in a memoir\r\nof him--at least one must not if one can't. But it is quite certain\r\nSydney Smith would have done it; and there are many ways in which a page\r\nmay be lit up. Well worth notice, as an amusing touch, was that passage\r\nin the Inquiry in which Burke speaks deprecatingly of Bunyan, because he\r\ndid not write like Virgil, and though the present work \"is biographical\r\nrather than critical,\" we miss a number of amusing anecdotes. This may\r\nbe the result of literary fastidiousness on Mr. Morley's part, but, if\r\nso, we submit that the fastidiousness is carried too far. There is a\r\nlittle story that some one (we forget the name at the moment) who had\r\nlost largely by investing in some West Indian property, alleged that he\r\nhad been induced to invest by Burke's glowing descriptions of the\r\ncountry, and that Burke replied, \"Ods boddikins! must one swear to the\r\ntruth of a song?\"--or in very similar language. Now this is really\r\nillustrative. We can by no means agree with Mr. Morley that Burke was\r\nfree from the vicious tendencies of the rhetorician, not to say the\r\nrhetorical Celt. He had the Celtic leaning towards forlorn hopes, and\r\nthe Celtic want of truthfulness. Of course, the Dr. Richard Price, who\r\nis so contemptuously treated in the \"Reflections,\" was a much smaller\r\nman than Burke, but he had more love of truth and more capacity of\r\nadhering to principle in his little finger than Burke had in his whole\r\nnature. Mr. John Morley does his friendly and ingeniously reticent best\r\nfor him; but students who reject the \"positive\" method (except as an\r\nauxiliary or a check) will persist in thinking that the painful tangles\r\nof the great man's life, and the blind alleys and other faults of his\r\nwritings, were the result of his deficiency on the side of truthfulness.\r\nIt will be doing anything but injustice to Burke, Mr. Morley, or the\r\nreader, if we call particular attention to p. 173 and so on to p. 177\r\ninclusive. They give a bird's-eye view of the most important part of the\r\nsubject; they contain instructive comparisons between Burke, Sir Thomas\r\nMore, and Turgot: and they seem to us to contain large proof in small\r\ncompass of what Mr. Morley will of course not admit--namely, Burke's\r\nwant of love for the truth, and his incapacity for abstract speculation.\r\n\r\nAs a reasoned account of the life and writings of the subject of the\r\nbook, Professor Huxley's _Hume_ is one of the very best of the\r\nseries--we were going to pronounce it the best, but remembered in good\r\ntime that we had not seen them all. In any case it is excellent. It does\r\nnot seem to us that Hume's \"Description of the Will\" is grammatically\r\nopen to the criticism on p. 181. But comment like this would be useless\r\nunless we gave the reader an opportunity of judging. This is Hume's\r\n\"description of the Will,\" as quoted by Professor Huxley:--\r\n\r\n    \"Of all the immediate effects of pain and pleasure there is none\r\n    more remarkable than the _will_; and though, properly speaking, it\r\n    be not comprehended among the passions, yet as the full\r\n    understanding of its nature and properties is necessary to the\r\n    explanation of them, we shall here make it the subject of our\r\n    inquiry. I desire it may be observed that, by the _will_, I mean\r\n    nothing but _the internal impression we feel and are conscious of,\r\n    when we knowingly give rise to any new motion of our body, or new\r\n    perception of our mind_. This impression, like the preceding ones of\r\n    pride and humility, love and hatred, it is impossible to define, and\r\n    needless to describe any further.\"--(ii. p. 150.)\r\n\r\nAnd this is Professor Huxley's comment:--\r\n\r\n    \"This description of a volition may be criticized on various\r\n    grounds. More especially does it seem defective in restricting the\r\n    term \"will\" to that feeling which arises when we act, or appear to\r\n    act, as causes: for one may will to strike, without striking; or to\r\n    think of something which we have forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nBut is not this met by the last six of the words which Professor Huxley\r\nhas italicised? They are certainly very wide, and one might ask, in\r\naddition, what word of absolute \"restriction\" is employed by Hume in\r\nthis passage? He indicates what he means by the word \"Will,\" by saying\r\nthat it is what we are conscious of upon certain occasions, and this\r\ngives a clue to the quality of the sensation; but it was obvious, and\r\ndid not need saying, that the quality of the sensation might remain,\r\nthough its complete outcome were baulked.\r\n\r\nIn presenting and criticizing Hume's views upon such topics as Theism,\r\nImmortality and Miracles, Necessary Truth, &c., Professor Huxley is, so\r\nfar as we have discovered, both accurate and candid. It is only\r\nnecessary to suggest that the reader should keep his eyes open--for\r\nthere is really not one new word to be written upon these matters.\r\n\r\nIt is not often that you are told what a man died of. You are put off\r\nwith some such phrase as \"a painful malady,\" or a \"family complaint.\"\r\nYet, it is often just what we desire to know, because the illness from\r\nwhich a man suffers stands in direct relation to his power of work and\r\nhis capacity of endurance. Consumption, except in its later stage, is\r\nnot usually painful. Nor does it necessarily make work difficult. The\r\nsame may be said of maladies which come on paroxysmally, and leave those\r\nblessed intervals of ease of which Paley, himself a sufferer, writes\r\nwith such unaccustomed tenderness. In the _Gibbon_ of this series, Mr.\r\nMorison slurred over the very curious, perhaps unexampled fact, that\r\nGibbon had long concealed a bad hernia and had done nothing for it. It\r\nfinally killed him, but that with his amazing corpulence he could live a\r\nlong time with a serious rupture, and keep his general health and his\r\nplacidity, is very interesting. Professor Huxley tells us point-blank\r\nwhat Hume died of, and it is quite as well for biographers to be\r\nspecific in such matters. We may just inquire, in passing, where the\r\nProfessor got his \"_solid_ certainty of waking bliss\"? It seems pedantic\r\nto notice every trifle of this sort, but if small errors in quotation\r\nwere, so to speak, nipped in the bud, many logomachics would be saved.\r\nHow much discussion, in pulpits and out of them, has been wasted upon\r\nthe supposition that Pope wrote that \"an honest man's the _noblest_ work\r\nof God.\" Whereas Pope wrote \"noble,\" and it was Burns, in the \"Cotter's\r\nSaturday Night,\" who started the error. Now \"solid\" is as good sense as\r\n\"sober,\" but the latter is what suits the verse best, and it is what\r\nMilton made Comus say.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe \"run\" upon Dante continues. Here is _Dante: Six Sermons_, by Philip\r\nH. Wicksteed, M.A. (C. Kegan Paul & Co.) \"In allowing,\" says Mr.\r\nWicksteed--\r\n\r\n    \"the publication of this little volume, my only thought is to let it\r\n    take its chance with other fugitive productions of the pulpit that\r\n    appeal to the press as a means of widening the possible area rather\r\n    than extending the period over which the preacher's voice may\r\n    extend; and my only justification is the hope that it may here and\r\n    there reach hands to which no more adequate treatment of the subject\r\n    was likely to find its way.\"\r\n\r\nThe sermons were delivered first at Little Portland Street Chapel, where\r\nMr. Wicksteed succeeded Dr. Martineau, and afterwards at the Free\r\nChristian Church at Croydon, where the Rev. Rodolph R. Suffield formerly\r\npreached, but where the Rev. E. M. Geldart is now (we believe) the\r\nminister. The book contains only about 160 pages, and gives a very\r\nreadable and complete account both of Dante and his poetry. The style is\r\nthat of the pulpit, iterative, florid, and full of amplifications; but\r\nthat was natural. It is a serious matter, however, that the author keeps\r\nup his strain of eulogy from end to end at a pitch which has an almost\r\n_falsetto_ sound with it. It seems hardly fair to leave unnoticed the\r\ncharges of artificiality and worse which have been abundantly made\r\nagainst Dante and his poetry, especially as this book is intended for\r\npopular use; and it is a pity that Mr. Wicksteed should go out of his\r\nway to settle difficult questions in this off-hand way:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is often held and taught, that a strong and definite didactic\r\n    purpose must inevitably be fatal to the highest forms of art,\r\n    must clip the wings of poetic imagination, distort the symmetry of\r\n    poetic sympathy, and substitute hard and angular contrasts for the\r\n    melting grace of those curved lines of beauty which pass one into\r\n    the other. Had Dante never lived, I know not where we should turn\r\n    for the decisive refutation of this thought; but in Dante it is\r\n    the very combination said to be impossible that inspires and\r\n    enthrals us. A perfect artist guided in the exercise of his art by\r\n    an unflagging intensity of moral purpose; a prophet, submitting\r\n    his inspirations\"--\r\n\r\nand so forth, in the same strained and insistent key. But no wise critic\r\nhas ever said that \"a strong and definite didactic purpose must\r\ninevitably be fatal to the highest forms of art.\" What is maintained on\r\n_that_ side of the debate is that the \"purpose\" must not be permitted to\r\nshape the poem; that the poem itself must be moulded upon lines of\r\nbeauty and not of \"moral purpose\"--though the \"moral purpose\" may be\r\nimmanent in the work. But who is bound to take Mr. Wicksteed's word for\r\nthe statement that Dante's great poem is not the very strongest\r\nconfirmation in all literature of the truth that a _controlling_ and\r\n_interfering_ moral purpose injures a poem, Milton's \"Paradise Lost\"\r\nbeing the next strongest?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA well-known, and also imperfectly known, \"nook in the Apennines\" is the\r\nRepublic of San Marino, about which there is a good deal of information\r\nin _A Freak of Freedom; or, The Republic of San Marino_, by J. Theodore\r\nBent (Longman, Green & Co.) It appears to be partly the record of a\r\nvisit paid by the author to the spot in 1877, and is illustrated by\r\nfifteen woodcuts from the author's own drawings, to say nothing of a\r\nmap. Mr. Bent was presented with the freedom of the Republic, and we do\r\nnot know that any one, except another citizen of it, or some near\r\nneighbour, could criticize his little book to much advantage. But we\r\ntrust he will permit us to remark that he might have made his work more\r\namusing and instructive. There is a good deal about the place in\r\nAddison, and this is referred to (among other interesting matters) in an\r\narticle in Knight's \"Penny Magazine\" for May 31st, 1834. But, though we\r\nhave not time to make references, we have a strong impression that there\r\nare many descriptions, new and old, of San Marino, which it would have\r\nbeen refreshing to quote. We know, however, of no work which gives so\r\nmuch information as Mr. Bent's.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt might be the subject of a very plausible doubt whether French novels\r\nof a high order ought to be translated into English, since those who are\r\nreally capable of understanding and enjoying them will be certain to\r\nunderstand French, and since, moreover, the finest qualities of the\r\nwriting must disappear in the process of translation. Then, with regard\r\nto French novels of a much lower class, they are not worth the trouble\r\nof turning into English; are more likely in themselves to do harm than\r\ngood; and their reproduction in our language cannot tend to encourage\r\n\"native talent.\" We have before us, from Messrs. Sampson Low, Marston,\r\nSearle, & Rivington, _The Cat and Battledore, and other Tales_, by\r\nHonoré de Balzac, translated into English by Philip Kent, B.A. (3 vols.)\r\nPerhaps it was not a bad idea to give the merely English reader some\r\nchance of appreciating the extraordinary qualities of the author of \"Le\r\nPère Goriot,\" \"Le Peau de Chagrin,\" and \"La Recherche de l'Absolu\"\r\n(neither of which is, the general reader may be told, in this\r\ncollection): but Balzac is not a writer with a soul in him, and the\r\nexperiment need not be carried any further. Those who know nothing of\r\nBalzac, and who read novels simply for excitement, will be glad of these\r\nthree volumes, and the glimpse they give of an unique writer; but to\r\nstudious readers Balzac's novels have an interest which is mainly\r\npsychological. The preface (here translated) to the \"Comédie Humaine\" is\r\na strange presumptuous medley, which raises, like all the author's most\r\ncharacteristic works, the question of perfect sanity--a question which\r\nMr. Leslie Stephen once opened very acutely, and dismissed too curtly.\r\nTo have read through a story of Balzac's is to have passed through one\r\nof those wonderfully vivid dreams which leave you puzzled and lost at\r\nthe moment of awaking. It seems to be generally admitted that his\r\nwritings do not tend to make his readers \"immoral\" in the usual sense of\r\nthe adjective, but there is something ineffably droll in his patronage\r\nof \"Christianity, especially Catholic Christianity,\" and that defence of\r\nhis own writings which the reader may amuse himself by studying in the\r\npreface. He is not only conservative, he is monarchical, and objects to\r\nrepresentative Government, if it \"hands us over to the rule of the\r\nmasses.\" But what chiefly concerns those who buy novels, or send for\r\nthem to the libraries, is the quality of the stories, and they may\r\ndepend upon getting a full measure of excitement, with some instruction,\r\nout of \"La Maison du Chat qui pelote\" and the companion stories.",
